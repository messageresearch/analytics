[41:52] Amen let's all stand let's sing one more
[41:55] song is our brother Troy comes the
[41:56] minister God's Word
[41:58] Troy's been a tremendous friend and he
[42:00] said some nice things about me last
[42:01] night so I really appreciate that I'm
[42:02] girl that he loves me it's good to get
[42:05] some encouragement from time to time you
[42:06] know and I really appreciate brother
[42:08] Troy and God used him tremendously when
[42:12] I've been on a few I mean some of us we
[42:14] went to God together and God used him in
[42:15] a great way in Guyana and years later
[42:18] people still remember his sermons that
[42:19] he preached because it was not his
[42:21] thought it was God's thought and and
[42:23] then I'll never forget at Napoleon when
[42:25] brother Troy preached that message on
[42:26] water baptism and a man in a cane came
[42:29] up and got prayed for and was healed
[42:31] there and the next day he didn't need
[42:33] the cane any
[42:34] and he still has names brother Phillips
[42:36] so always remember how God used brother
[42:38] Troy in such a tremendous way about the
[42:40] power in the name of the Lord Jesus
[42:42] Christ aren't you glad there's power in
[42:43] the name of Jesus brother lives the life

[42:57] find one thing wrong with his life he
[42:59] just loves the Lord serves God he's so
[43:01] faithful what a testimony when she wants
[43:03] somebody say that about you that's what
[43:05] the Bible said you're blameless and
[43:07] that's only by the blood of Christ amen

[48:15] relationships chapter three I says and
[48:18] unto the Angel of the church in Sardis
[48:21] write
[48:23] these things saith he that hath the
[48:25] seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars

[48:48] therefore how thou has received and
[48:51] heard and hold fast and repent if
[48:53] therefore shall not watch I will come
[48:56] unto thee as a thief and thou shalt not
[48:58] know what hour I will come unto thee
[49:00] thou hast a few names even in sardis
[49:03] which have not defiled their garments
[49:05] and they shall walk with me in white for
[49:09] they are worthy a man fifth verse says
[49:11] and he that overcometh the same shall be
[49:15] clothed in white raiment and I will not
[49:17] blot out his name out of the book of
[49:19] life but I'll confess his name before
[49:21] the father and before his angels amen I
[49:25] will not blot his name out of the book
[49:26] of life amen they walked with him and
[49:29] they were worthy what a testimony amen

[49:53] praise thee for I am fearfully and
[49:55] wonderfully made marvelous are thy works
[49:58] and that my soul knoweth right well my
[50:01] substance was not hid from thee and when
[50:04] I was in seat made in secret and
[50:06] curiously wrought in the lowest parts of
[50:08] the earth thine eyes did see my
[50:10] substance yet being unperfect and in thy
[50:13] book all my members were written which
[50:15] in continuance were fashioned when as
[50:18] yet there was none of them how precious
[50:21] also are thy thoughts unto me O God how
[50:24] great is the sum of them if I should

[51:20] Amen
[51:22] hey man you could be seated hey man our

[51:27] and I just want to thank him for being

[51:44] I'll be right there don't you worry
[51:46] don't you fear that that word will go on
[51:48] down all the way through history to the
[51:50] very end of the age where we are now
[51:51] amen amen so I want to preach a smart a
[51:54] message called the book of life the
[51:57] story of life God has a book amen yes
[52:02] hey man he's testified of it all
[52:04] throughout the Bible you know Moses
[52:06] talked about it David talked about it
[52:08] talked about in the New Testament and
[52:10] Jesus spoke about it throughout all the
[52:13] there's been this testimony that God has
[52:15] a book Amen you know and when I think
[52:18] about that that you know it's but the
[52:20] Bible says that that book was there from
[52:21] the foundation of the world so you know
[52:25] we you know as humans you know we we
[52:27] have a lot of books that we've written
[52:29] you know there's authors all over the
[52:31] world that are busy writing right now
[52:33] there's people probably writing trying
[52:35] to create some new thought some new book
[52:37] right now someone somewhere in this
[52:39] world is sitting down on a computer
[52:40] somewhere probably trying to draw
[52:42] thoughts out of their mind and put them
[52:44] on paper amen so they can express to the
[52:46] people what is on their mind there's
[52:48] been many good books
[52:49] and written there's been many bad books
[52:51] have been written as then books that
[52:53] should never have been written whether
[52:55] there has been books there be a comfort
[52:56] to many people but one thing's for sure
[52:58] that if there's any book that has
[53:00] written God wrote the first one amen and
[53:04] when you think about God as being an
[53:05] author God is really the only one that
[53:08] really knows how to write a book amen
[53:10] everybody else is really just playing
[53:11] around hey man we can try to do our
[53:15] things we can try and do this we can
[53:17] never really compare until unless he
[53:20] comes down and puts a seal on it himself
[53:22] amen you know when a when a man has a
[53:25] book that he wants to write you know he
[53:27] he first has to have an idea in his mind
[53:30] of what he wants to write about amen and
[53:33] so and what an author does he has this
[53:35] great thought he has a thought it starts
[53:37] off with a thought in his mind he had
[53:40] wants to get that thought expressed he
[53:42] wants to express it to the people and so
[53:44] when an author he he starts to write his
[53:47] book he has to you know he has to he
[53:49] kind of breaks it out of the thought and
[53:51] then you know if it's gonna be a chapter
[53:53] book he has to take that thought and
[53:54] express it out over so many chapters you
[53:57] know if he can break that thought and
[53:59] you know ten or twelve different things
[54:01] and he'll put ten or twelve different
[54:02] chapters to it and then oh you don't
[54:04] know and I'll put that each leave a
[54:06] little portion of the thought in each
[54:07] chapter there's no break that out and
[54:10] he'll just start going methodically you
[54:12] know down through through through and
[54:13] and breaking the thought out more and
[54:15] more and more and when he takes the book
[54:17] to the publisher to be published she has
[54:19] to have a title for his book payment and
[54:22] that title he wants to pick just the
[54:24] right title because it has to be not
[54:26] just a tireless descriptive of what's on
[54:29] the inside of the book has to be an
[54:30] accurate reflection of what's on the
[54:32] inside of the book so if you went to the
[54:34] library to get a book of recipes and you
[54:36] saw my hundred best recipes in the open
[54:38] happiness about World War two then you
[54:41] know that the the title the book did not
[54:44] properly Express what was on on the
[54:46] inside of the book amen because every
[54:49] book that you pick up when you when you
[54:51] when you finish reading that book you
[54:54] should be able to say within your own
[54:55] self now I see why he put this title on
[55:00] that book
[55:02] amen amen because when you're done with
[55:04] it you should be able to have a clear
[55:05] sometimes you know you're looking like
[55:07] well why would he title at that or why
[55:09] would he title at this but once you get
[55:11] to the very end
[55:12] now that the glory of that book has been
[55:14] expressed to you as you have experienced
[55:16] this book now you can go back and take
[55:18] all the way back to the building now I
[55:20] see now I understand that's why he put
[55:22] this title up on this book
[55:24] amen amen so so God as an author he had
[55:28] this book and he wanted to title it life
[55:31] amen amen and now if anybody you know we
[55:35] might have some idea in our life of our
[55:38] in our mind of what life really is but
[55:40] truly God is only the only one that
[55:42] really knows what life is amen
[55:45] you know God is see if God is gonna
[55:47] write a book about life he's gonna have
[55:50] the best idea of anybody what life
[55:53] really is a manual you take this world
[55:56] and us and it's an amazing creation of
[55:58] God you know there's there's life
[56:00] literally everywhere on this planet amen
[56:03] you go you to the deepest depths of the
[56:05] ocean and there's life you go out to the
[56:07] desert and it looks all barren but if
[56:09] you look closely there's something there
[56:11] there's something living there in the
[56:13] middle of the desert if you go up to the
[56:15] Arctic places where it's cold and and
[56:17] barren and almost nothing can grow and
[56:19] yet you still you see something darting
[56:21] here or darting there because there's
[56:22] life in the coldest places there's life
[56:25] in the lowest places you go up to the up
[56:27] into the air and you'll see life flying
[56:29] through the air or even even a little
[56:31] bits of algae or plant matter floating
[56:33] in the you know floating off the
[56:35] horizons you know and there's literally
[56:37] life everywhere all the plants and
[56:40] they're giving off their pollen and this
[56:42] whole this whole creation down to the
[56:44] ocean water you take it in the examiner
[56:46] ether microscopy see little micro zones
[56:48] grow there in the water and there is
[56:50] literally life everywhere on this planet
[56:52] this planet has been completely filled
[56:55] completely filled with life and they go
[56:57] off to the moon and they go off to Mars
[56:59] and they're looking with their
[57:00] microscopes trying to find life
[57:02] somewhere and they can't find it because
[57:04] God has for some reason endued this list
[57:07] planting here to be filled with life
[57:09] because he wanted this plant to be an
[57:11] expression of his life amen amen so in
[57:14] God row
[57:15] his book he he said I'm gonna sit down
[57:17] I'm gonna express my thoughts about life
[57:21] I'm gonna Express
[57:22] I have attributes within me I have these
[57:24] attributes of life within me and I want
[57:26] to get them down I want to write them
[57:28] down and I'm gonna express it and put it
[57:30] in a book I'm gonna call it life but you
[57:32] know you know when you when a man writes
[57:34] a book you know he he gets out of his
[57:36] high flowery language he wants to
[57:37] impress the people you know and he gets
[57:39] the how deep his thinking is and
[57:41] everything you know but when you when
[57:44] you open the book of life it's different
[57:46] because when you open the book of life
[57:48] Oh what is this
[57:50] this is the book that's gonna describe
[57:52] God's life and when you go and take the
[57:55] book off and you open it up and there's
[57:57] no flowery language there's no big high
[58:01] ideas or things written by man but it's
[58:03] just names in there amen so God the
[58:07] Almighty God who the man that knows more
[58:10] about life the person the person that
[58:13] knows more about life than anybody here
[58:15] on the earth when he went to go write
[58:17] about one of the greatest subjects that
[58:19] there has ever been about the very life
[58:21] of God he just started writing Adam
[58:24] Moses amen and he's kept writing David's
[58:29] you know these are the thoughts these
[58:31] are my attributes that are gonna
[58:33] describe my life amen they're gonna
[58:35] describe Who I am
[58:37] they're gonna describe my great thinking
[58:39] they're gonna describe what I had in my
[58:41] mind before before the foundation of the
[58:42] world before there was ever a thought
[58:44] before there was ever anything that
[58:46] there was God and he had a thought in
[58:48] his mind about life amen
[58:50] and there was two things that God did
[58:52] before the foundation of the world amen
[58:54] was he he wrote a book and he called it
[58:57] life amen and then they put that he
[59:00] filled that book with names in it
[59:02] brother Bram said the only thing in that
[59:03] book is names amen and he filled that
[59:06] that's what first thing he did for the
[59:08] foundation world the second thing he did
[59:09] for the foundation of the world as they
[59:11] took any stool lamp for those names Amen
[59:14] that if any of those names would ever
[59:16] fall short of the glory of God that
[59:18] there will be a blood sacrifice a man
[59:20] before one speck of time before one
[59:22] blade of grass before one thing ever
[59:24] grew on this earth before one animal
[59:26] ever put one foot in front of the other
[59:27] there was a book of life
[59:29] describing God's life on the earth amen
[59:31] and not only that but there was a blood
[59:33] sacrifice for those names in case any of
[59:36] them would ever by chance by somehow
[59:38] fall short of the glory of God
[59:40] there was already a sacrifice laid there
[59:42] a man before one speck of time think
[59:44] about our God has made this thing so
[59:46] sure because his life is going to be
[59:49] expressed upon the earth it's going to
[59:52] happen it has to happen it cannot fail
[59:55] God is going to express his life on the
[59:57] earth no matter what he's gonna make it
[59:59] happen he's going to get it done amen
[1:00:01] and I just think I would think about all
[1:00:03] of the things that we go through in life
[1:00:05] or the or the troubles or the or the
[1:00:07] heartaches or why did this happen or why
[1:00:09] did that happen and you think but all
[1:00:11] along your name is sitting there
[1:00:14] testifying throughout all the ages that
[1:00:17] there will be a man they'll come upon
[1:00:18] this earth there will be a woman they'll
[1:00:20] come upon this earth and when she gets
[1:00:22] her is she is going to describe my life
[1:00:24] amen amen and God has done made the end
[1:00:29] plain from the beginning I have a quote
[1:00:32] here brother Bram's I wanted to read
[1:00:33] from the message identification it says
[1:00:36] there in paragraph 52 or 51 says then
[1:00:40] see God came down and the character of
[1:00:44] God was Christ he was the reflection he
[1:00:48] was God made visible notice God made
[1:00:51] visible in the beginning was God he
[1:00:53] wasn't even God then no God wasn't as an
[1:00:55] object of worship and the only thing was
[1:00:57] was the eternal and in him was
[1:01:01] attributes and those attributes were
[1:01:03] thoughts and those thoughts were
[1:01:05] expressed two words and the word was
[1:01:09] made fan of manifest Amen amen
[1:01:11] what is it it's all God becoming
[1:01:14] tangible tangible God be made tangible
[1:01:18] you can feel him you can see him you can
[1:01:21] see his expression Amen God what is it
[1:01:23] it's all God becoming tangible and you
[1:01:26] are a part of God what a statement you
[1:01:32] are a part of God amen
[1:01:35] and Jesus came to redeem those that was
[1:01:39] put on the Lamb's Book of Life before
[1:01:42] the foundation of the world
[1:01:43] it was in God's thoughts and that's what
[1:01:46] he came to redeem God's thoughts God's
[1:01:49] thoughts of you God's thoughts of you
[1:01:51] God's thoughts of you God had these
[1:01:53] thoughts and he had these thoughts and
[1:01:55] he was going to make sure these thoughts
[1:01:57] were redeemed amen amen
[1:02:00] the Jesus came to redeem those that was
[1:02:03] put on the Lamb's Book of Life before
[1:02:05] the foundation of the world it was in
[1:02:07] God's thoughts and that's what he came
[1:02:09] to redeem and then as soon as it strikes
[1:02:12] them they see it because the life is in
[1:02:17] their
[1:02:17] Amen so as they they have a name they
[1:02:20] have an expression you know we we have
[1:02:23] our children and we try to give them the
[1:02:24] names to the best of our ability but God
[1:02:27] is the one that really gives the true
[1:02:29] name amen amen and God has we want why
[1:02:32] because God has a perfect idea he knows
[1:02:34] the end from the beginning we name our
[1:02:36] children based on the the vision has
[1:02:38] given to us of our children's life but
[1:02:40] God is the one that knows the end from
[1:02:42] the beginning and he is the one that has
[1:02:44] truly given our name and a name is so
[1:02:46] much more than just a few letters out of
[1:02:48] the English alphabet amen amen but a
[1:02:50] name is something that God has given us
[1:02:52] your characteristic it's your it's your
[1:02:55] it's your it's it's who you are it's
[1:02:57] what today he took that name and he put
[1:02:59] it upon the Lamb's Book of Life this is
[1:03:01] who they are this is what they will be
[1:03:03] this is what their their nature will be
[1:03:06] this is what they will describe this is
[1:03:08] how they this is how they will express
[1:03:12] my life upon the earth amen so when we
[1:03:16] came we were born of our natural parents
[1:03:18] and we will inbound our life trying to
[1:03:20] express life amen and we tried and we
[1:03:23] try and we tried and we failed miserably
[1:03:25] didn't we amen we tried to express life
[1:03:28] we all of us when we were 5 years old we
[1:03:31] tried it when we were 10 years old we
[1:03:33] tried it we were 15 we tried we tried
[1:03:35] and tried and tried all of us yet from
[1:03:38] the littlest child in here all the way
[1:03:39] up is trying to express life a man just
[1:03:43] like all of every blade of grass out
[1:03:44] there trying to express life only but we
[1:03:47] have been made in the image of nature of
[1:03:48] God trying to express life but
[1:03:51] ultimately we cannot do it until the
[1:03:52] wife of God comes down on the inside
[1:03:55] hey man all of our trying is vain all of
[1:03:57] our trying is vain until God first takes
[1:04:00] his life and places it down on the
[1:04:02] inside amen amen brother Brian he said
[1:04:05] the only way that you can actually be a
[1:04:07] Christian the only way only one way or
[1:04:10] the only way that you can actually be a
[1:04:12] Christian is for Christ who is the
[1:04:14] mystery for is for Christ to identify
[1:04:17] himself in you hey man we can try to do
[1:04:22] our things to be a Christian but oh I
[1:04:23] way you know ultimately you know there's
[1:04:26] only one mass everyone's saved yes
[1:04:28] that's Jesus Christ amen he is the only
[1:04:32] begotten of the Father right Amen you
[1:04:35] know Galatians 3:16 says that the
[1:04:37] promise was to one seed but the promise
[1:04:40] was to one that's Christ is John 3:16
[1:04:43] Galatians 3:16 the promise was to one
[1:04:46] that is to Christ so the only way we can
[1:04:48] be saved is how is to be found in him
[1:04:51] amen that's the only way we could be
[1:04:53] saved is because there's only one man to
[1:04:55] save that's Christ amen but if you can
[1:04:57] ever get yourself in there ever get
[1:04:59] yourself in there and have him identify
[1:05:01] you by expressing his life through you
[1:05:02] amen there you will find your salvation
[1:05:04] outside of that were lost a man outside
[1:05:08] of the life of Christ down on the inside
[1:05:10] we're lost if we cannot get to a place
[1:05:12] where we can honestly say without
[1:05:15] knowing that we're without without any
[1:05:16] lie on the inside without lying that I
[1:05:19] am testifying of the life of Christ by
[1:05:23] his acts down on the inside of my life
[1:05:25] they were lost amen
[1:05:29] that's a puts a lot of pressure on us a
[1:05:32] man but there's one way you get the
[1:05:33] pressure off a man is to allow yourself
[1:05:36] to submit yourself underneath the Holy
[1:05:38] Ghost that's when your works finish amen
[1:05:40] amen
[1:05:41] so when so when an author go back to the
[1:05:44] author you know when when you like say
[1:05:46] you have a bookshelf at home it has fold
[1:05:50] books and you say there's some in there
[1:05:52] these you've read some that you haven't
[1:05:55] read but there's always guarantee you
[1:05:57] could be a couple books in there that

[1:06:39] actually cracked open the cover you've
[1:06:41] never looked down on the inside then you
[1:06:43] know nothing about that book amen but if
[1:06:46] there is a book on that shelf that you
[1:06:49] have read from cover to cover amen you

[1:07:12] experiencing the glory of that book amen
[1:07:15] though all the glory from the beginning
[1:07:17] in the end I am now entering into
[1:07:19] whatever that author had in his mind
[1:07:21] when he started writing I am entering
[1:07:23] into that thought and whatever the glory
[1:07:25] of that book is I am entering into the
[1:07:27] glory of that look because each book has
[1:07:29] its own particular glory amen and Yolen

[1:15:05] attribute of life and he was by the the
[1:15:08] and Adam and Eve there and it was by
[1:15:10] miss placing the word they misplaced
[1:15:13] that one word and they lost the they
[1:15:17] lost their ability to express life on
[1:15:19] the earth
[1:15:19] amen amen they lost their ability to
[1:15:22] express life on the earth maybe that's
[1:15:24] not that they still couldn't try they

[1:15:27] they had their walk they talked to God
[1:15:29] and all those things but still it was
[1:15:31] not according to the pattern because
[1:15:34] it's not according to how what God had
[1:15:36] down in the book from the before the
[1:15:38] foundation of the world that these men
[1:15:41] and women will express my life perfectly
[1:15:43] amen they will be expressing my life on
[1:15:46] the earth amen but Christ has come to
[1:15:48] redeem back amen to redeem back our
[1:15:52] purpose for what we were gone God before

[1:15:59] love it he wrote our names our
[1:16:03] attributes everything about God has a
[1:16:05] purpose our portion of God's own life
[1:16:08] there we're here on the earth to express
[1:16:11] each one of us amen if you're named
[1:16:14] beyond the Lamb's Book of Life then you
[1:16:16] have a portion of God the same God that
[1:16:21] created the heavens in the earth the
[1:16:23] same God that created the trees and the
[1:16:25] hills that we enjoy the same God that
[1:16:27] created our families and all this that
[1:16:29] we love and enjoy that same God has
[1:16:31] placed a little bit of himself down on
[1:16:33] the inside of you and you're the only
[1:16:35] one that can express that I cannot
[1:16:38] express your part for you amen amen
[1:16:42] I can't express the part of God that was
[1:16:44] given to you to express I can't do that
[1:16:46] for you
[1:16:46] you have to do that and you can only do
[1:16:48] it by the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:50] amen that's the only way so only hope
[1:16:53] it's only hope we have is the never
[1:16:56] failing presence of the Lord Jesus
[1:16:57] Christ in our lives a man as I said yes
[1:17:00] say you know brother Branham he was
[1:17:01] given that that promise by the Lord
[1:17:03] where the Lord he says and a voice
[1:17:04] entered into the room and said to me
[1:17:06] don't you fear to go anywhere or do
[1:17:09] anything because the never-failing
[1:17:11] presence of the Lord Jesus Christ will
[1:17:12] be with you everywhere you go
[1:17:14] a man I think my would I have a promise
[1:17:17] like that you do ever promise just like
[1:17:19] that amen
[1:17:19] for I will be with you even in you until
[1:17:21] the end of the age amen
[1:17:24] that's the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:26] he's leading us into eternal life
[1:17:29] Amon is leading us to express our
[1:17:31] portion of the book of life our portion
[1:17:34] of God's life on the earth amen and God
[1:17:37] is miraculous that's why I brother Brown
[1:17:38] said that the true church will write a
[1:17:40] book of Acts behind it

[1:17:44] Holy Spirit leadership in the church and
[1:17:46] every member of the local body

[1:18:03] was a stone block in it so he told him
[1:18:04] roll away the stone and a man named
[1:18:06] Lazarus walked out a man one time there
[1:18:08] the the he went by the funeral
[1:18:10] procession and there had the body on the
[1:18:12] bier there you know and and he touched
[1:18:14] it and and the guy jumped up and was
[1:18:16] alive again why because he was full of
[1:18:18] life amen and he is the same yesterday
[1:18:22] today and forever amen you know brother
[1:18:25] brandy said the three full purpose of
[1:18:28] Christ the mystery you know you remember
[1:18:31] from Christ the mystery of God was
[1:18:33] revealed the three full purpose was one
[1:18:35] to reveal the mystery of God himself to
[1:18:39] the people through Jesus Christ three
[1:18:44] full purpose of Christ on the revelation
[1:18:46] of Jesus Christ amen
[1:18:48] to reveal the mystery of God Himself
[1:18:50] what God is a mystery who can understand
[1:18:52] him who can understand who can
[1:18:54] understand how great God is a man who
[1:18:57] can understand how how marvelously is
[1:18:59] when I think about like you know the DNA
[1:19:01] and and you know how marvelous you know
[1:19:04] and you know everything is still obeying
[1:19:07] the Word of God you know you know you
[1:19:09] and God spoke a tree into existence at
[1:19:12] the beginning and that tree gave forth a
[1:19:16] seed and that seed had that on the
[1:19:19] inside of it the DNA that was created by
[1:19:21] God you know it's amazing the O's week
[1:19:23] as they you know they they have a I
[1:19:26] think it's called SETI it's
[1:19:28] search for extraterrestrial intelligence
[1:19:30] you ever heard of it
[1:19:32] and they have satellite dishes that are
[1:19:34] scanning the heavens and they're looking
[1:19:37] they're waiting to receive a some type
[1:19:40] of radio transmission from some type of
[1:19:42] intelligence out there on another planet
[1:19:44] because they believe that there's
[1:19:46] extraterrestrial life out there and
[1:19:48] they're scanning all the radio waves
[1:19:50] from the other neighboring stars and
[1:19:52] planets waiting they if they could
[1:19:54] receive some some type of a radio
[1:19:57] pattern that could not be explained away
[1:20:00] by a random chance that had to have an
[1:20:02] intelligence behind them that they'll
[1:20:04] say that they found life outside Hertz
[1:20:07] Amen there they've been scanning the
[1:20:09] heavens now for probably 20-30 years
[1:20:11] there was waiting waiting waiting for
[1:20:13] that signal to come across and yet but
[1:20:16] if they took a microscope hey man if
[1:20:20] they went down to one of these DNA
[1:20:21] sequencers you know and and looked at
[1:20:23] the DNA they'd find that there is a
[1:20:25] signature down on the inside of these
[1:20:28] seats down on the insides of these
[1:20:29] plants there's a signature of an
[1:20:31] extraterrestrial intelligence a man who
[1:20:35] wrote his his and wrote his signature on
[1:20:37] every little bit DNA all over the world
[1:20:39] amen that's even this pulpit here well
[1:20:42] it is part of a tree that was still was
[1:20:45] obeying the Word of God from the
[1:20:47] beginning when it was growing
[1:20:48] Amen every generation of tree going on
[1:20:51] down down down down down still obeying
[1:20:54] the Word of God still obeying the Word
[1:20:56] of God
[1:20:56] sylvain the Word of God when God spoke
[1:20:58] it out amen amen
[1:21:01] and so are we we ought to be still
[1:21:03] obeying the Word of God still obeying
[1:21:05] the Word of God amen in every generation
[1:21:07] coming on down teach this to your
[1:21:10] children and to your children's children
[1:21:12] and to their children after them that we
[1:21:14] are obeying the Word of God amen amen
[1:21:18] so the threefold purpose was to reveal
[1:21:20] the mystery of God himself to the people
[1:21:22] through Jesus Christ the second full
[1:21:25] purpose was that Christ might have the
[1:21:28] preeminence and his bride that he that
[1:21:31] Christ might live in the people in the
[1:21:34] bride and to express himself through her
[1:21:38] amen the whole one of the major
[1:21:42] everybody knows about almost everybody
[1:21:43] in the world knows about Jesus Christ
[1:21:45] amen but do they know about his bride my
[1:21:50] Amen but do they know about his bride
[1:21:53] who is the holder of his life Amen what
[1:21:57] was was it she is expressing God's life
[1:22:00] that is one of the purposes for what she
[1:22:02] gained the warrant of the entire purpose
[1:22:05] of one of the you know these three fold
[1:22:06] purposes they're they're amazing to me
[1:22:08] because the first one is Christ the
[1:22:10] second one is Christ in us my war the
[1:22:13] whole purpose of everything that we see
[1:22:15] here was so that Christ might reveal
[1:22:17] himself through his bride amen so they'd
[1:22:21] say he might have the preeminence in his
[1:22:23] bride that he might live in the people
[1:22:25] and express himself through her a man I
[1:22:28] think about you know you know it did you
[1:22:30] know I think about the types of Christ I
[1:22:32] think about them a lot because you know
[1:22:34] when you think of like Joseph Joseph
[1:22:37] went through some rough stuff a mint a
[1:22:41] man he was sold into slavery yes that's
[1:22:45] not an easy thing to have happen have
[1:22:47] your brothers take you and throw you in
[1:22:49] a pit and then you know you think of you
[1:22:51] trying you down there wonder if they're
[1:22:53] gonna kill you or what they're gonna do
[1:22:54] and then I pick you up and they sell you
[1:22:56] as a slave a slave all the dreams you
[1:23:01] had of having a wife and a family and
[1:23:04] and raising and having your own piece of
[1:23:05] land where you can live are all just -
[1:23:08] wait an instant that is now you are a
[1:23:10] slave now you've become a slave and he's
[1:23:14] going away and why is he going through
[1:23:16] that because he was a type of Christ he
[1:23:19] was experiencing that because Christ was
[1:23:21] sold by his brother everything he
[1:23:23] experienced when he was sold for twenty
[1:23:25] pieces of silver because Christ was
[1:23:27] being sold for 30 pieces
[1:23:28] why why why was he put in prison there
[1:23:31] with the butler on the one side and the
[1:23:33] baker on the one side because he was a
[1:23:34] type of Christ Christ was revealing
[1:23:36] himself through Joseph
[1:23:38] amen amen all the things that he went
[1:23:41] through all that was because he was a
[1:23:43] type of Christ amen it kind of helps us
[1:23:45] we'll understand a little bit better of
[1:23:47] why we are going through some of the
[1:23:49] things that we go through
[1:23:51] amen because Christ is being expressed
[1:23:53] through us he is expressing his life
[1:23:55] it's a great
[1:23:56] story it's a great drama a man where
[1:23:59] Christ is beginning to reveal himself
[1:24:01] amen through his bride amen amen think
[1:24:05] about think about David you know when he
[1:24:07] when he went up on the hill of Jerusalem
[1:24:09] was weeping over the city as he was
[1:24:11] rejected he was he had been anointed by
[1:24:13] God to be king amen
[1:24:16] but then his own people his own brethren
[1:24:18] his own children they excommunicated
[1:24:20] from the city and he went up the hill
[1:24:22] weeping and wailing because he was
[1:24:25] rejected over his King his he loved his
[1:24:28] lambs amen he loved his lambs God had
[1:24:31] given him a new set of lambs his people
[1:24:34] his children - - to reign over and to
[1:24:37] see that they were safe and worship with
[1:24:40] the God of heaven and now he was
[1:24:42] rejected and was unable to lead them
[1:24:43] anymore weeping and wailing why was he
[1:24:46] going through it because the same thing
[1:24:47] that would happen to Jesus Christ he was
[1:24:50] expressing the life of Christ down on
[1:24:52] the inside amen one thing I really loves
[1:24:55] I the story of Jonah who I think about
[1:24:59] Jonah I can relate to him yeah when God
[1:25:03] says go and do this and you go and do
[1:25:06] this I think oh my you know you could be
[1:25:11] as critical as you want oh man he should
[1:25:13] have listened to the word of the Lord
[1:25:14] anything
[1:25:15] oh look those don't be too critical
[1:25:17] Jonah No amen amen because you should
[1:25:20] have wished and listened to I should
[1:25:21] have listened to the will of the Lord
[1:25:23] amen
[1:25:23] hey man is now I could think Jonah's
[1:25:26] going down to Tarsus as he takes the
[1:25:28] boat when the Lord told him to go to
[1:25:29] Nineveh and he took the boat and went to
[1:25:31] Tarsus and he's thinking why am I such a
[1:25:34] disobedient prophet and why can't I be
[1:25:38] like Elijah why can't I be like Moses
[1:25:41] why can't I be like Enoch why can't I be
[1:25:43] like all these men that I've read about
[1:25:45] and every time God tells me to do this
[1:25:47] and all sudden it's just something rises
[1:25:48] up and I go and do this he's beating
[1:25:51] himself up in his mind he knows that
[1:25:53] he's guilty he knows he's going contrary
[1:25:55] to what God told him and he doesn't me
[1:25:57] he's like I don't know why am I doing
[1:25:58] this why am I doing this and yet the
[1:26:00] whole time through he's in his obedience
[1:26:03] he's being a perfect type of Christ hey
[1:26:05] man where Jesus in the self even spoke
[1:26:07] of it he said just like Jonah was in the
[1:26:09] belly of
[1:26:10] wael three days and three nights social
[1:26:12] the Son of Man be in the belly of the
[1:26:14] earth amen amen and the most disobedient
[1:26:17] prophet and the most in the midst of his
[1:26:20] most disobedient act was typing out the
[1:26:24] most obedient thing that was ever gonna
[1:26:25] be done on the face of the earth a
[1:26:27] minute it gives me a little bit of hope
[1:26:29] about my own self amen
[1:26:32] it gives me a little bit of hope a
[1:26:33] little bit of assurance that maybe maybe
[1:26:35] some base on my foolish nature it's
[1:26:39] maybe someone will come to good somehow
[1:26:41] amen amen that's that's our hope amen
[1:26:46] that's our hope a man's a guy who'll get
[1:26:48] some use amen Psalms 139 we read there
[1:26:51] how great is his the sum of his thoughts
[1:26:53] towards me amen let me let me I want to
[1:26:56] find that and read that once more amen a
[1:26:59] man says in verse 16 of the 1:39 ER said
[1:27:02] the eyes did see my substance yet being
[1:27:04] unperfect and in thy book all my members
[1:27:07] were written which in continuance were
[1:27:09] fashioned when as yet there was none of
[1:27:11] them how precious also are those are
[1:27:14] those unto me O God how great is the sum
[1:27:20] of them Amy I'd like to say that we have
[1:27:23] not expressed all thus the sum of his
[1:27:25] thoughts we have not yet expressed the
[1:27:29] fullness of his thoughts towards us Amen
[1:27:32] I'd like to - to even express even
[1:27:36] further than this that even at the point
[1:27:37] of the rapture we still will not have
[1:27:40] fulfilled all of his thoughts towards us
[1:27:43] amen amen even when we when we when we
[1:27:47] enter into his gates with Thanksgiving
[1:27:48] and we enter into his courts with praise
[1:27:50] we will still not I've expressed all of
[1:27:53] his thoughts that he has towards us amen
[1:27:56] because we will live and reign with him
[1:27:58] throughout all eternity and we'll be
[1:28:00] continually expressing the thoughts of
[1:28:03] the internal God and the some of his
[1:28:05] thoughts how great you know I can't
[1:28:07] express those thoughts for you right
[1:28:09] only you can do that and he wrote it in
[1:28:12] a book before the foundation of the
[1:28:14] world the sum of his thoughts towards
[1:28:18] you and he compass it and all in just
[1:28:20] one name that he is preserved and given
[1:28:23] to
[1:28:23] and that name is the sum of his thoughts
[1:28:27] towards you the sum of his thoughts
[1:28:30] towards you
[1:28:31] he has thoughts and he is determined
[1:28:34] that you will fulfill every single one
[1:28:37] of those thoughts amen that's why the
[1:28:41] blood had to come because he will not
[1:28:44] let us past away into oblivion did for
[1:28:49] our soul to disintegrate because we have
[1:28:52] to express his thoughts because he
[1:28:54] reserved his thoughts from before the
[1:28:57] foundation of the world for you to
[1:28:59] express Amen and you must express them
[1:29:02] by the leadership of the Holy Ghost and
[1:29:05] all the power of heaven on earth is
[1:29:06] behind you to make sure that the
[1:29:09] thoughts that God has for you from

[1:29:25] presence of the Lord Jesus Christ will
[1:29:27] be with you everywhere you go why
[1:29:29] because his thoughts will not fail the
[1:29:32] sum of his size how how great they are
[1:29:34] towards you how we marvel how great the
[1:29:38] mountains are we marvel at how beautiful
[1:29:41] the ocean is and we marvel about the the
[1:29:44] fields and seeing the deer go through
[1:29:45] the fields and the and just the Marvel
[1:29:48] of the the fog in the morning and and
[1:29:50] the beauty of his creation but greater
[1:29:52] than that is the sum of his thoughts
[1:29:55] just for you greater than all that is
[1:30:00] the sum of his thoughts that he is
[1:30:01] placed in you to express amen and we

[1:30:36] case

[1:30:39] short of the glory of God
[1:30:40] he put the blood there to make sure that
[1:30:43] we could express the fullness of his
[1:30:45] glory amen amen the third fold purpose
[1:30:48] was to restore back

[1:36:55] chapter 13 as we come towards closing
[1:36:57] here
[1:37:09] I'm sorry Hebrews chapter 3 we'll start
[1:37:15] with the last verse that we'll go on
[1:37:17] into chapter 4 and it says Hebrews 3:19
[1:37:21] it says so we see that they could not
[1:37:26] enter in because of unbelief amen now as
[1:37:31] talking about the children of Israel
[1:37:32] amen now let's go to verse 4 or chapter
[1:37:35] 4 verse 1 so they could not enter in
[1:37:38] because of unbelief verse chapter 4
[1:37:40] verse 1 says let us therefore fear lest
[1:37:44] a promise being left of a left us of
[1:37:47] entering into his rest that any of you
[1:37:49] should seem to come short of it for unto
[1:37:53] us was the gospel preached as well as
[1:37:55] unto them but the word being the word
[1:37:58] preached did not profit them not being
[1:38:00] mixed with faith and then they heard it
[1:38:03] for we which have believed do enter into
[1:38:06] rest as he said as I have sworn in my
[1:38:08] wrath if they shall enter into my rest
[1:38:10] although the works were finished from
[1:38:12] the foundation of the world amen
[1:38:14] so there is a rest for us to enter into
[1:38:16] amen amen and if we miss that rest we
[1:38:20] miss everything if you cannot come and
[1:38:24] give me your testimony about how Christ
[1:38:29] the life of Christ is on the inside of
[1:38:32] you something that Christ has done for
[1:38:35] you then tell me don't don't don't don't
[1:38:38] miss it don't know that if there is a
[1:38:40] promise that has been given to you of
[1:38:43] having the life of Christ on the inside
[1:38:44] a living moving life of Christ that
[1:38:47] expresses itself through you a
[1:38:49] leadership of the Holy Ghost that is
[1:38:51] given to you to live out your portion of
[1:38:54] God's life on the earth don't miss that
[1:38:56] amen if you don't have the testimony of
[1:38:58] that in your life if you can't come and
[1:39:00] give me your testimony of that then cry
[1:39:02] out to the Lord Lord I want you to live
[1:39:04] inside of me amen I want you to as Jesus
[1:39:07] said the foxes have holes the birds of
[1:39:10] the air have nests but the Son of man
[1:39:12] has no place to lay his head amen but
[1:39:14] now we have the opportunity to give
[1:39:17] Christ a landing spot he meant to give
[1:39:19] Christ a place a man where he can come
[1:39:22] down
[1:39:22] and live and well then move in us and
[1:39:25] have his beam in us amen and express
[1:39:27] what he has always wanted to express is
[1:39:29] his himself living in the people a man
[1:39:33] that has been the purpose of what he has
[1:39:35] wanted from the beginning a man when you
[1:39:37] look at those three full purposes every
[1:39:39] single one is there for our purpose it's
[1:39:42] for us to beat live and commune with him
[1:39:45] on the earth that has been his whole
[1:39:47] purpose for the last six thousand years
[1:39:49] of this earth amen amen
[1:39:52] he is the same yesterday today and
[1:39:54] forever amen as we said in the book
[1:39:57] there is a glory for every book and for
[1:39:59] the book of life there is a glory amen
[1:40:01] and it was given to us to express that
[1:40:03] glory that we could be excited about it
[1:40:05] amen amen you know you can't really be a
[1:40:08] proper witness of Jesus Christ until
[1:40:10] you've experienced it a man I remember
[1:40:12] once when I was a when I was a teenager
[1:40:14] I went witnessing door to door with the
[1:40:16] denominational Church I went to and I
[1:40:17] didn't have the Holy Ghost I didn't have
[1:40:20] a testimony that was not easy
[1:40:24] amen because you can memorize all the
[1:40:26] scriptures you want to you can do you
[1:40:28] can save to leave through Romans Road
[1:40:31] you can do all the things that you want
[1:40:33] to do and though this you just repeat
[1:40:35] this prayer verbatim after me and you
[1:40:37] can call yourself a Christian but let me
[1:40:39] tell you what until you have the life of
[1:40:41] Christ down on the inside you cannot be
[1:40:43] a witness of Christ amen
[1:40:45] every single one of us in this room
[1:40:47] ought to strive and strive and strive
[1:40:49] until we have something that God has
[1:40:52] given us down on the inside of life that
[1:40:54] we can identify and say that is the life
[1:40:58] of Christ on the inside of me
[1:41:00] amen Christ is experiencing expressing
[1:41:03] his life down on the inside of me and
[1:41:06] now I have becoming a new creature in
[1:41:08] Christ amen amen not the man I once was
[1:41:11] but Christ has changed me amen amen
[1:41:15] or amen otherwise as I as I as I I think
[1:41:19] the brother said something about
[1:41:20] preaching about water baptism you know I
[1:41:22] appreciate all back called bearing false
[1:41:25] witness of your baptism
[1:41:29] took that from Scripture we read there
[1:41:31] about them when they came out as though
[1:41:33] they came out of the Red Sea Paul said
[1:41:36] that when the sugar of Israel went
[1:41:38] through left Egypt and they went through
[1:41:40] the Red Sea Paul said that they were
[1:41:42] baptized unto Moses amen think about
[1:41:47] Dayton and Cora were baptized unto Moses
[1:41:51] Nathan and Cora when they when they
[1:41:54] walked through the Red Sea they are
[1:41:56] testifying we will follow Moses
[1:41:58] everywhere he goes we will listen to
[1:42:00] every word he says everything he tells
[1:42:02] us to do we will obey that's what they
[1:42:05] were testifying when they followed Moses
[1:42:08] through the Red Sea and they are
[1:42:09] baptized unto Moses when they went amen
[1:42:12] and so what happened when they got to
[1:42:13] those side of the Red Sea they said well
[1:42:15] we don't want to necessarily don't know
[1:42:17] if everything Moses said is really what
[1:42:20] we should be following I don't know if
[1:42:23] Moses really is a true prophet of God
[1:42:25] there might be other people that we can
[1:42:28] listen to but still I have a word for
[1:42:29] the day that is better than Moses is
[1:42:31] word for the day amen amen and we have
[1:42:35] something else that we should go listen
[1:42:37] to this over here listen let let's bless
[1:42:39] rise up leaders so we can go back to
[1:42:41] Egypt because it really it was a lot
[1:42:43] easier when we were living in Egypt and
[1:42:46] then living out here hey man we really
[1:42:48] enjoyed the the sins of Egypt better
[1:42:50] than living out here in the desert with
[1:42:52] this man who says he has the word of the
[1:42:54] Lord
[1:42:54] they were bearing false witness of the
[1:42:59] baptism of the Red Sea amen and so as
[1:43:02] every Christian when they when they go
[1:43:04] down into the waters of baptism and they
[1:43:06] are immersed in the water and they come
[1:43:08] back up they come back up and they are
[1:43:10] testifying I will follow the Lord Jesus
[1:43:12] Christ everywhere he goes I am taking
[1:43:14] his name upon my forehead
[1:43:16] amen everything that he says he
[1:43:17] everything that the Holy Spirit does I
[1:43:19] will love amen everything that the Holy
[1:43:22] Spirit does I will say yes and amen to
[1:43:25] it if the Holy Spirit is in it I will
[1:43:27] say Amen to it everything that the Holy
[1:43:29] Spirit does on the earth I am gonna love
[1:43:31] it and obey it and follow it amen amen
[1:43:33] and that's what the Christians do once
[1:43:36] they are baptized in the name of Lord
[1:43:37] Jesus Christ
[1:43:38] you follow what the acts of the Holy
[1:43:39] Spirit are in the church when you see
[1:43:41] the Holy Spirit acting
[1:43:42] you love it you obey don't speak against
[1:43:44] it don't say thing a contrary to it but
[1:43:47] wherever the holy spirit does love that
[1:43:48] love that love it love it love it why
[1:43:50] because the Holy Spirit is drawing you
[1:43:52] from the Red Sea drawing into the River
[1:43:55] Jordan why so he can give you his
[1:43:57] inheritance a man so you can live and
[1:43:59] the fruit of the land amen he's drawing
[1:44:01] you don't don't bear false witness of
[1:44:03] your baptism amen don't bear false
[1:44:06] witness of a if you were if you were
[1:44:07] called out that you were separate if
[1:44:09] you're called out and went into the
[1:44:10] water and testified and when you rose up
[1:44:12] the I am dead to the things of the past
[1:44:14] and I am Alive to the things of Christ
[1:44:16] amen then you follow that every single
[1:44:18] day until you are sealed with the Holy
[1:44:20] Ghost amen because that's what your
[1:44:22] baptism you were testifying a man jesus
[1:44:25] said that when there are two or three
[1:44:26] gathered on the earth
[1:44:27] amen and whatever they bind on the earth
[1:44:29] I will bind it in the heavens amen God
[1:44:33] took Dathan and Cora's baptism seriously

[1:48:17] up because they didn't believe the
[1:48:21] gospel that brother Brian was preaching
[1:48:23] amen but he got that from Saint Paul
[1:48:25] because Saint Paul said Oh King Agrippa
[1:48:27] I was not disobedient to the heavenly
[1:48:29] vision and he described the vision to
[1:48:31] him Amen so so so st. Paul had a vision

[1:48:43] I was not disobedient to other vision
[1:48:46] that was given to me on the road to
[1:48:46] Damascus I have fulfilled that vision
[1:48:49] faithfully constantly faithfully costly
[1:48:51] as far as brother Bram doing when he
[1:48:53] stood there up in Chicago he said God
[1:48:55] has given me a vision a meant he says an
[1:48:58] angel came down he was in the tree said
[1:49:00] you don't smoke don't drink don't ever
[1:49:02] defy your body in any way he says you'll
[1:49:04] be sent with a healing ministry of
[1:49:05] healing amen amen and I even Kings will
[1:49:09] be able to stand before you amen if you
[1:49:11] will be sincere and when you pray amen

[1:49:28] have a vision amen

[1:50:03] we have a vision just like st. Paul just
[1:50:05] like brother Branham that we have a
[1:50:07] heavenly vision and we have not been
[1:50:08] disobedient to it amen if you have been
[1:50:11] disobedient to you they ought to repent
[1:50:15] Amen why because if you have if you're
[1:50:18] not fulfilling that heavenly vision the
[1:50:20] new you're bearing false witness of the
[1:50:22] prism where when you were baptized Amen
[1:50:25] but what when you repent there's grace

[1:51:32] book of life before the foundation of
[1:51:33] the world he is not changed what that
[1:51:35] thought is brother BAM said that that
[1:51:38] because your name is written there that
[1:51:40] when the life strikes it when the light
[1:51:42] strikes that name that they send they
[1:51:44] see it they often they become a life to
