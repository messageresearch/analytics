last night and he just brought out that scripture you know Jesus said if you have the faith the size of a mustard seed and we know what a faith is Faith is a revelation it's a substance right so God gives you a substance of his own faith and so we I just thought again wow if we could just have that much Revelation you know then we can speak to the mountain and it'll move by God's grace but it's got to be God's will right it's got to be God's will just like Paul three times said take this away from me take this buffeting me messenger way well he had Faith to believe it but Jesus said no it's my will for you to suffer like that so we want to find the will of God hallelujah but in the same in the same breath here maybe we don't know all God's will for all these situations let's pray God

thank God we believe thank you thank you Jesus hallelujah hallelujah so glad we can believe Hallelujah let's take our Bibles here tonight as we're standing here by the grace of God let's go to Romans chapter N9 I kind of felt led as I was studying in these last few days to look at Romans 9 we finish Romans 8 on Sunday morning we look at Romans chapter nine this is part 21 ACAA by God's grace on the book of Romans Hallelujah you know we had a really wonderful outpouring of the Holy Spirit there on Sunday morning and I listen to cam service and so today they had a really nice outpouring of the Holy Ghost I thought hey we both had a really nice shower from the Holy Ghost on Sunday morning I love when God does that Hallelujah Romans chapter 9 verse one we look to the Lord here tonight ask God to break the word of God to us hallelujah you brother am and I brother Aman and I were talking after service and we were talking about what a great day in the Lord it was and and I just said you know brother it's just amazing just preach you know every word in this Bible is thus sayith the Lord and when God's spirit comes upon it it just makes it live praise God and I love that don't you love that when God's spirit comes on it and makes it live Hallelujah so blessed by God's grace Romans 9 verse one imagine we'll just read verses 1 through three I'll read one and two myself and then we can all join and read verse three together by the grace of God verse one says I say the truth in Christ I lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost that's quite a statement right there that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart for I could wish that myself I'm sorry verse three I'm sorry one two three for I could wish that myself were a curse from Christ for my brethren my Kinsmen according in to the flesh let's have one more word of prayer here by God's grace I'm kind of in a hurry I got to slow down a little bit father God we just humbled ourselves in your presence we're thankful Lord we feel bold for the Holy Spirit we're thankful we believe Lord you've given us this gift of faith Lord God and is not our faith is the Faith of Christ Paul says I live by the Faith of Christ we're living by your faith tonight so Lord anoint me anoint your people Lord build our faith here as we pray for brother Mike at the end Lord God that you would just move on his behalf Lord God and I pray you minister to every need here tonight father thou knowest all things Lord God we love when you visit us on Wednesday night Lord Sunday morning Sunday night we love when your spirit visit so Lord let us have another visitation of your spirit Lord God because we need you we love you Lord God there's nothing greater in this world Lord God than the Holy Ghost atmosphere Lord sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus may we enjoy these Heavenly places here tonight anoint your people anoint me in Jesus Christ's name and the saint said amen amen God bless you as you're being seated praise praise God hallelujah so we look here tonight I'm going to set a timer here just kind of watch My Time by God's grace you know we are we're moving now by God's grace we're moving into this uh this fifth section uh that CI scoffield kind of outlines in his commentary that's the book that's the Bible brother Bram used was CI scoffield he was uh uh he was a pre-trib Rapture teacher yeah and uh a lot of people you know don't agree with that but brother Bram taught it like that and he taught lots of types and shadows of that so that's where we stand and um scoffield has a lot of great thoughts and uh brother Ram just got used to the Bible you know he said there are some things I disagree with you know like with the Trinity and so forth you know we don't believe in three persons we believe in one person but uh you know it's there's so many great thoughts in here from scoffield and brother Ram preached numerous thoughts from scoffield and preached them Hallelujah so uh you know we're going into this this fifth part and this fifth part is God's promise promises to Israel now it was really wonderful we saw the introduction in chapter one and then the next section was the whole world is guilty before God in chapters 1 two and three then in chapter three there's a transition but we're justified by faith for the solution for our guilt and then in chapter five then it transitions again to the Believers walk in the Holy Spirit and that goes through uh chapter 5 6 7 and we just finished eight on Sunday morning Hallelujah now this is just really I'm sorry and then I'm sorry the next one was the final result of the Gospel blessing so Romans 8 scoffield calls it the final result of God's blessing Hallelujah and the blessing of the Holy Ghost Boy and if you ever felt blessed I hope you felt blessed by reading Romans chapter 8 Hallelujah it starts off with no condemnation and it ends with no separation Hallelujah nobody's going to condemn you and nobody can separate you from Jesus's love Hallelujah nobody Hallelujah none and he lists 17 things that cannot separate separate us from the love of God and I love that last one he says any other Creature if there's anything outside of these 16 things not even that one can separate is from God's love hallelujah amen so can I say it like this it's in the bag our Victory is uh paid for hallelujah our Victory is certain our future home is certain Hallelujah church is that right we get to live in the Heavenly City the holy city the New Jerusalem with Jesus hallelujah what a blessing amen and it's quite a shift now though when you go to chapter nine Paul ends chapter eight by saying all these amazing blessings but then he goes right to this thought here in in verse one what a what a what a what a statement he makes here I say the truth in Christ now of course he was telling the truth the whole time but you know as humans we say things like that to put more emphasis on it right Paul was telling the truth all through the first eight chapters but here he just wants to make a true statement so he repeats it I don't lie of course he doesn't didn't lie in the other verses he wrote my conscience also Bears me witness in the Holy Ghost so Paul's conscience was a witness to him that what he's going to say was the truth in verse two that I have a great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart now chch just stop there a moment here's the man who just said I have no condemnation he said I got the victory through Jesus Christ who can be against me if God is for me nobody can lay anything to my charges nothing can separate me from the love of God but yet he says I still have a great heaviness and continual sorrow of heart now church this is a great mystery to me and I believe church this is the mystery of the human mind Paul says we have three parts we have a body a spirit and then we have a soul right it's amazing Paul can say rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice did he not say that when I preached on the book of Philippians he's saying always Rejoice we know that must be a soul thing right it must be a soul desire right it just be the nature of the Christian is to rejoice rejoicing God am and the same man that says that now can come down and say I I I have continual sorrow in my heart for Israel and church it's this great mystery of the Christian Life right you can be beaten down but you're never defeated amen right you can be under fear but you're never you're never you're never forsaken amen right I mean it's yeah that love that scripture always bearing about in the my body the marks of the Lord Jesus yes sir brother Hallelujah don't you love that I just love I just find it so amazing he can just give us a whole list and give us all these questions just like God did to job all these questions are meant for us to think about and and and more Ponder more deeply God's love for us and make us happy and make us rejoice and brother BR said when you read Romans 8 it takes all the wind out of Satan's sails in other words you don't you don't feel like the enem is hot on your Trail anymore you feel like you got some distance between you and the devil amen amen you got some peace you got a season of rest hallelujah amen that's what Romans 8 does but then just one a mention of one subject Israel takes him from all this Joy oh I'm sorrow I'm sorrowful in another way Hallelujah this is the mystery of the Christian walk right we experience all we have all these blessings all this Joy all this peace all this assurance Blessed Assurance Hallelujah but then you could say one word Israel and it turned you to a different state of emotion right thank God we know how to control our emotions right we've been preaching on that Hallelujah and Paul says I have this continual it's like an unending sorrow in the Greek it means unceasing grief or pain so the same man that says always Rejoice he says I've got this constant pain in my heart Hallelujah so don't feel bad you come to church you know sometimes I feel bad I'll come to church I'll dance I'll shout I'll rejoice and then I'll leave and I'll hear just some maybe a family member struggling or something and then my heart just Falls and in the past I've been discouraged about that but after reading that now I don't feel discouraged that's the normal part of the Christian walk it's the ups and downs right it's it's understanding you have confidence in God but when but then when you see you know struggles you see people you know in this case they're blinded to the gospel amen when we see our family members blind to the gospel it should make us sorrowful we should have a feeling for them we should have a desire to see God save them Hallelujah so we can go from rejoicing and all you did a Jericho March right here right on Sunday we all had a wonderful time in the Lord but then somebody can say one word your mom or your dad right or your neighbor or your cooworker they can say one word and all of a sudden all that happiness it just comes down to a real solemn a real serious feeling that you have and that's the experience of a holy ghost filled Saint and the church said how many believe Paul was filled with the Holy Ghost amen right from the scales fell from his eyes ananas prayed for him he received the Holy Ghost Hallelujah remember God even withheld some of his healing at times with his eyes so I just find this amazing and he has to say this I'm not lying he said I'm not lying I've told you all these things he said but when I someone talks about Israel I have a continual heaviness in my heart for them the church God put that there for a reason I believe God put it there so Paul would go preach to them amen hallelujah so if you got a little sorrow in your heart if you got a little feeling in your heart for somebody it's there to motivate you to pray for them or go talk to them or share a Bible with them or what invite them to church amen that's why it's there Hallelujah so we see what a what a what what a contrast he can go from to there's nothing can separate me from God's love I have no charges Hallelujah the devil can't put one charge on me but then someone mentioned Israel and now he's sorrowful went from all this rejoicing to to sorrow so fast that's normal for a Christian Hallelujah and look at verse three this is a true sign this man had the spirit of Christ for I could wish that myself were a curse from Christ this is equal to basically saying he was going to hell right a cursed for my brethren my Kinsmen according to the flesh this is how much he loved his people anybody got any family members that are lost but you still love them so much with all your heart Hallelujah you you would do anything if they could get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ full of immers fully immersed in water you do anything and Paul says I wish that I could be cursed so that they could see the gospel what a statement does that remind you of anybody from the book of Exodus Moses right God told Moses I got think it's Moos Exodus 32 from I'm not mistaken on my notes Exodus 32:31 Moses returned to the Lord and said oh this people have sinned a great sin and have made them gods of gold yet now if thou will forgive their sin if not blot me I pray out of the book which thou Hast written now look even he'd even wish he was blotted out for idolators how many ever seen idolators in the last few weeks or months people that worship money that worship uh their physical appearance right and in our case there's people that worship brother brandom it's so sad it's it's heresy people worship anything they worship their car they worship their job right they worship their Pastor they worship anything and Paul says I wish I was cursed so these idolators would not be blotted out of God's book it's a true sign he's a prophet right Paul true sign he's a real believer I he's a real sign he's got the spirit of Christ Hallelujah why because Christ became a curse for us hallelujah remember Galatians 3 says it now before we move on though God said Moses whosoever has sinned against me him will I blot out of my book what a paradox to live in I wish I could just be I would do anything to get these people saved I myself I would give up my salvation if it were possible so that these people could be saved I make an exchange and you know if if Paul had done that God would have saved him anyway right because God's a god of Mercy amen God of love but he can't do that each person has their own free moral agency like Joshua said choose you this day whom you will serve Hallelujah and the Bible said God will give every man and woman according to their own Works Hallelujah that they've done in the flesh Hallelujah Galatians 313 said Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law he's brought us back he's purchased us and brought us into the faith being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree now why was he cursed so we could be blessed amen realize that church the reason you're blessed tonight is because Christ was cursed for you am that's the only reason right now some of us have good parents like Naomi's got some wonderful parents Hallelujah others you got some real good Godly Parents I you got some good Godly Parents brother R yeah he's like yeah Hallelujah and thank God for that but really Christ took the curse of your parents Christ took the curse of every person he died not just for our sins but the sins of the whole world praise God Amen so this is the love of Christ we can see Paul has the love of Christ Moses has the love of Christ I wish I could be cursed so that this person could be saved remember brother Ram said if you want to see somebody go to hell he said you probably not even saved he said you need to come down to this altar right here here if you want to see anybody lost if you want to see anybody burn or anybody suffer or torment your heart is not right with God right we should uh because Christ was cursed that we might be blessed church that's the whole Spirit of giving right sometimes you know we give we don't have a lot of money or or maybe we don't have a lot of time but we give anyway and it feels like it's a burden but it's the reason we give is to bless other people we live for the blessing that's what Jesus did Hallelujah he lived for the blessing and that's what we've got to live for live for the blessing of sacrificing for others praise God may God give us wisdom this week or next few days here to see how can we be a blessing to others who can we or who can we help and how can I lay aside my life how can I lay down my life as Jesus said for somebody else sometimes it's driving to pick them up for church right right church sometimes it's just dropping off off praying for them when they're sick right just stopping by or dropping off some groceries when they need some groceries right Church be a blessing you know Jesus gave those six things you can do or people do and they're given eternal life in Matthew 25 right visit the poor give them clothes right uh visit them in prison uh give them food all these all these acts of kindness right Jesus says if You' done that you've done it to me hallelujah oh amen hallelujah what a blessing now Romans 9:4 who are Israelites so he said 'I wish I could be cursed for the Israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption right because they were a nation that were not the children of God but God made them his children right they were in Egypt they were slaves to idolatry but God brought them out he separated them from their from their sinful past right and God adopted them and he brings them into his country Israel amen he makes them possess the promised land he gives them an inheritance I love what God said I'm going to give you houses you didn't build I'm going to give you vendors you didn't plant hallelujah amen I'm adopting you into my family Hallelujah and church we're living on the labors of all the preachers who went before us we're benefiting from all the people that preached the last 40 50 hundred years praise God we're still living off the benefits of isusa Street amen hallelujah Martin Luther and John Wesley and all these Mighty Men of God brother we're living off of their testimonies we're blessed because of their Ministries praise God we wouldn't be where we are today without all of their efforts and all their sacrifices Hallelujah that's what Paul's saying here these were the Israelites they had the adoption they became the children of God didn't God tell Pharaoh he said let my son go out let my children go out and worship me in the wilderness praise God my people they also had the glory they had the covenants praise God they had the GI giving of the law and the service of God and the promises praise God what a blessing man if you had all that you'd feel pretty good wouldn't you but guess what church we got we got all that amen doesn't Galatians say you're adopted remember the brother Ram said the triumphal Capstone of the Holy Ghost is Galatians 4 because you are Sons God has sent his Spirit into your hearts amen you've got the spirit of adoption Hallelujah that's right you've got the New Covenant the the the blood Covenant of Jesus's blood you've got the law of the Holy Spirit we're not under the law of Moses we're under the law of the Holy Spirit you've got that amen and you got the service of God and you got the promises amen but Israel had these as well in the previous form the old Covenant and the Bible said now we've got better promises amen we got a better Covenant praise God verse five who are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came now Paul's saying look at this wonderful people that I wish I could be cursed for even Christ came to them this is such a wonderful people even the Messiah came to Israel and Christ who's overall finishing verse 5 God bless forever amen so he's saying let me remind you this is the people I wish could be saved the people God visited the people God adopted the people that God gave C and Promises I wish I could be cursed so they could see what I see praise God didn't brother Ram say living for others is eternal life isn't that what eternal life is I'm living for them I just want to see them saved I'm I'm so thankful I'm saved but my heart's broken I want to see them saved hallelujah hallelujah this is a real man of God right here verse six not as though the word of God have taken none effect for they are not all Israel which which are Israel so now he gets down into this truth that just because someone was born an Israelite doesn't mean they're saved right not all Israel is Israel so these are amazing privileges but the true Israel he said is the elected Israel is what it's going to get into next here by God's grace verse seven neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called Hallelujah that is they which are the the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seed so Paul says even within Israel there's children of God that are children of the flesh they're just Israelis according to the flesh you know they keep circumcision they keep the Mosaic law he said but then there's children of the promise who the promise was given for and I'll say like this those who obey the promises Hallelujah keep the promises of God right because we all know Jesus rebuked the Pharisees uh they they they paid tithe of cumin and the mint right they they measured the exact exact tithing on their oils and everything like that but Jesus said you're of your father the devil right he said you missed the weigher parts of the law see they were born Israelis but they weren't living they weren't they were missing the promise of Christ Hallelujah that's what we can't miss today we can't miss the promise of Christ today that's why brother Ram's Ministry is so important brother Ram gave us I wrote it in my book and brother I've got free books for you I've written two books if I'll give them to you after service I put it in the last chapter brother Ram gave us 30 thus sayith the Lords from the Bible Paul was brother man was just finding what what Paul taught restoring it to the church and then saying that's thus sayith the Lord and most churches reject it right but it's laying right here in the scriptures hallelujah hallelujah brother brandom uh finished the mystery of God and there's 12 there's 12 doctrines that are called Mysteries and brother Ram revealed those To Us by the Holy Spirit and how'd he do it he just gave us more verses to explain it like the godhead the Rapture Israel's blindness Christ in you the hope of glory the mystery of godliness my there's 12 of them we could I could I need I need my reference there's so many I forget him Hallelujah but brother R finished all those Hallelujah and then he foretold the future Hallelujah on numerous occasions I'll show this because brother Rod's here in 1965 brother Rod brother Braham had a vision and he had a vision of the true the original book of Acts church and they were marching it was all women and they they marched past him he said glory to God then he had a vision of the American church and they walked by dancing to rock and roll and they were really immorally dressed they had uh they were almost there the women the backside was almost naked and he and then he cried before God he said God is we after all this preaching we've done is that all we can produce but the voice said that's not the bride that's the American church he said now is coming forth the bride and then he saw another group of women it looked just like the women at the beginning Hallelujah that because Jesus is the first and the last Hallelujah and he said then in that group was a woman who was representing the nation of America that was proving there was going to be a holy church in the United States of America just like all the other nations praise God Amen and and and then brother you know 40 years later look at the mega churches what do they got rock and roll like got they got a lot of half- naked women in the churches too and my mother was raised in the Assemblies of God and I told her that vision and she said I I was raised in Assembly of God she said I never thought rock and roll would come in but she saw rock and roll first then rap and now they got country they got everything now just like the prophet of God said hallelujah amen hallelujah what a blessing and so you know we have we have these proofs laid out before us and we must accept the worthy we must be the children of the promise Hallelujah amen there's more promises in the Bible than what you know we love the denominational people we don't like their system right because the their system denies the word of God but we love the people but they're forgetting some of the promises Hallelujah they're forgetting the promise of the Rapture Hallelujah that one day Jesus is going to snatch away his bride in the moment and the twinkling of an eye Hallelujah they're forgetting the promise that men should cut their hair and women should have long uncut hair they're forgetting that promise amen they're forgetting the promise that God made a male a male and a female a female Hallelujah that's a simple Genesis one promise I mean you can't miss that in the very first if you miss that in the first chapter of the Bible you're going to mess up the rest Hallelujah if you miss that one it's so plain they're missing the marriage and divorce one man one woman for life until death Hallelujah but most churches promote adultery right even fornication they promote all these things in homosexuality we could go on and on and on but the true church has got to look at the end just like she did in the book of Acts Hallelujah and she will and we're a part of that Hallelujah because God sent brother brandom to point us back to the Bible amen thank you Jesus now we see that in verse eight this is that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seed verse n for This Is The Word of Promise at this time will I come and Sarah will have a son so for for Israel it was all about the promised son Oh Glory Isaac but our promised son is Jesus Christ amen the Son of God hallelujah am Heaven's hero right Heaven's son Hallelujah The Treasure of Heaven amen and our promise is that son the spirit of the son living in our souls that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen Jesus Promised it Jesus called it the promise of the father in Luke 24:49 and it's the it's the holy ghost in Acts chapter 7 that the Sanhedrin Council rejected and and and Stephen said you always do resist the Holy Ghost and he's talking to Jews that said we're the we're the people of God we've got the promises we've got the covenants but Stephen's saying the promise is the Holy Ghost now Hallelujah this is the message of the hour God is fulfilling this now it's still today even today 2,000 years later it's still all about the promise hallelujah amen who's living for the promise of the Holy ghost who's living for the promise of the restored book of Acts Church who's living for the promise of the Rapture Hallelujah while the whole world was watching the Super Bowl I was working on my YouTube video and got it out on Sunday night by God's grace let them watch that trash I mean that that's what they feed on right uh that's what vultures feed on is dead stuff but Eagles right well eagles they they do get the so getting a little technical Eagles do eat some uh roadkill sometimes but Eagles normally like the the fresh meat Hallelujah they they usually like to get their own fish but there's some pretty mean Eagles out there my wife and I saw one one time and an osprey got the fish and landed but then the eagle come knocked the Osprey out and took the fish they don't mess around when it comes to territory Hallelujah that's how we should be with the devil right we should knock the devil out of our territory Hallelujah knock him out of your thought life knock him out of your your bad habits knock him out Hallelujah draw night to God resist Satan and Satan will hallelujah amen but it's all about the promise for this day hallelujah it's more than just speaking in tongues like I was raised in that church and to speak in tongues they said that's the evidence but I saw a lot of people speak in tongues that didn't have the Holy Ghost they might have had a gift of the Holy Ghost but you got to have more than a gift you got to have the giver hallelujah amen hallelujah and that's the promise today the promise today is Christ in us the hope of glory hallelujah amen where you're sealed not just to the next Revival you're sealed to the day of your Redemption Hallelujah Jesus repeats this in Acts 1:4 and 5 he says go up to Jerusalem and wait until you're new with power from on high and he called it the promise of the father it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost your soul is baptized your soul is immersed with the spirit of God Amen and how do you know because you can say amen and believe every word of God hallelujah that's how you know my soul is immersed in the spirit of God everything the word says I believe it Hallelujah and I'll do my best by God's grace to live it amen when the Lord shows me I'm wrong I'm I say Jesus forgive me uh try me again let me be stronger this time Hallelujah let me take revenge on the enemy who who uh who caused me to sin Hallelujah and the Bible said we're even drawn away by our own lust help me to overcome the lust of My Flesh Hallelujah then Peter says This Promise was fulfilled in Acts 2:33 we received the promise of the father Hallelujah that's why I'm so glad we sung that on Sunday I'm one of them amen I've danced and screamed and shouted and cried till my ribs hurt and I feel like if I sing or dance or cry one more time I'm G to die and I've ask God have mercy on me in other words I know what it's like to be there on the day of Pentecost I've had a Pentecostal experience that's what you and I need we need a Pentecostal experience Hallelujah every and brother like brother said every now and then we need another uh we need another experience Hallelujah we need another boohoo and hallelujah amen another time of rejoicing Hallelujah another time of surrender to God hallelujah amen it's a promise Hallelujah so see just as the the true Israel in the Old Testament had to be under the promise of the son Isaac we've got to be under the promise of Heaven's son Jesus Christ and that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah that's what he said I'm Gonna Leave but I'm going to send you the comforter I'm going to send you the spirit of truth and the spirit of truth don't lie Hallelujah that's we got a lot of churches today and preachers lying they're telling lies Hallelujah but God help us to tell the truth hallelujah amen Romans 9:10 again the natural Israel and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children now here I want to look at this here just for a moment for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth I love this as Paul breaks now into this election now Church election means chosen so see each person must do according to the purpose of God according to God's choosing God chose you to be his child God chose you to the adoption amen God chose you because he knew you'd believe the promise Hallelujah in this case he's going to get to Jacob and Esau well who really wanted the word Esau didn't want it right he God knew Jacob would want it and now he got it the wrong way and he paid for it too but eventually after he got all that nonsense beat out of him amen by the angel wrestling the angel once he got all that nonsense beat out him he said I'm a new creature don't call me Jacob don't call me supplanter call me Prince with power with God and man hallelujah amen what's he wrestled that angel and got over all his deceptive conniving ways he came out of there a new person praise God Amen that's why he types the baptism of the Holy Ghost Abraham types God the Father father Abraham Isaac types the son the promised son but Jacob types the Holy Ghost CU he wrestled with God until he was changed on the inside Hallelujah he had a real Holy Ghost experience Hallelujah and now he's a prince he's a new man he's got the spirit filling him hallelujah amen hallelujah father son Holy Ghost now the Holy Ghost is guiding him and he's got a new name Hallelujah and the Bible said the f the name of the family of God in heaven and earth is Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah you got a new name church when you got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you got that name Lord Jesus Christ amen that's wonderful praise God so before you were born I'm applying this to you and I now before you were born God already chose you and I can prove that with Ephesians 1:4 and5 hallelujah oh I love this verse don't you brother Rod I was chosen in Christ where was I chosen you know some of the times the children ask me we're looking at pictures from a few years ago and G he's like where am I at I can't explain all that you know but because it's kind of she's a little immature for all that discussion but I just tell her honey you were in the mind of Christ Hallelujah Ephesians 1 four five according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of world see that's where God elected you in the mind of God you didn't pre-exist as a a separate being no but you were a thought of God you were an attribute of God you were in God's mind brother Braham said you were in God's family album Hallelujah he had all the everybody in his album and his family he knew everybody and you were in The Bride section of the book hallelujah praise God thank you Jesus so see Jacob was in the mind of God then and see Church your Works will prove where you you were at before the foundation of the world right if you want that promise how many want the promise of the Holy Ghost amen I'm talking about all of God's blessings Hallelujah not just being born again yeah that but after that we need years of service right we need fruits of the Holy Spirit we want to mature with our gifts Hallelujah all like like the Bible said more fruit much fruit he that abides in me will bring forth much fruit not just fruit and more fruit but much fruit praise God that the father might be glorified Hallelujah that's what we need by the grace of God God but where did he choose you he chose you in Christ before the foundation World God knew Jacob would want the spiritual blessings I'm so thankful for the first 19 years of my life I ran from the spiritual blessings but there had to come a time where I had to turn over and God knew that right I used to be the one that hated Church the most of all maybe maybe not the most out of all my brothers but I didn't like going to church I was I didn't like it but when I turned 19 when I saw that that I saw uh Tim Anderson that football player rais his hands and I was there I repented of my sins I said what a shame if that six foot six guy can raise his hands what about me well I've wasted all these 19 years no more I'm surrendering to Jesus hallelujah praise God hallelujah that's right I recognize it that's the moment where I transfer I I get changed into a new being praise God that's the moment God knew would come God orchestrated that event in my life God God orchestrated your events of your life Hallelujah he knew when you'd surrender he knew when you draw night to him cuz he was drawing you hallelujah amen amen and that's the key church that's the key now this chapter brother R said and everybody knows this not just brother Ram everybody knows this Romans nine is all about predestination this is the sovereignty of God chapter have you ever heard that brother this is the sovereignty of God chapter because Paul breaks it down like really God just made V vessels to honor and God made Vessels Of Dishonor and who's going to tell God I don't like what you did who's going to rebuke God who's going to get God to change his mind uh the answer is nobody God does what he wants right but we don't we we didn't see that before the foundation world all we see is what we see right now all we see is we see the word of God we see the promises of God and if you react and you're hungry for the the the the spirit of God and if you want the promises of God that proves to you now that you are a child of God hallelujah if you want the promise of God like Jacob want the promise of God if you'll do anything to get to heaven if you'll do anything to be in the Rapture you know you're a child of the promise hallelujah amen amen I won't let the Super Bowl keep me out of the Rapture I won't let any pet sins or secret sins I won't let any of that keep me I'm going all the way just to see him Hallelujah like that song I'm going all the way just to see him the one who suffered and died for me Hallelujah I think that one verse says I might have to walk by myself but I'll see him might have to walk on my by myself but I'll see him I might have to walk by myself but I see him the one who suffered and died for me hallelujah praise God hallelujah I didn't always feel that way but what happened something happened praise God Amen I was elected by the grace of God in the Greek it actually means election means the act of picking out or choosing it's God's Free Will by which before the foundation world he decreed His blessings to certain persons the decree made from Choice by which he determined to bless certain persons through Christ by Grace Hallelujah so God has a purpose a choosing As Romans 9:11 says not of works but of him that calls see God had called Esau God had called Jacob but only one of them came and God knew which one would come right you have to come Jesus said you have to take up your cross and follow me he said if you don't take up a cross you're not my disciple so the election is proven in our sight the election is proven by who obeys Jesus if you love me keep my commands if you love me take up your cross every day and follow me Hallelujah Church we've all got things in our lives we wish we could change do you ever you know ever had a week like I I have a good I have sometimes weeks like this I'll be so happy leaving church but then sometimes something will happen and I'll just feel like trapped sometimes like I just can't get out of this right why can't this how many times have I prayed to God why can't this certain thing change am I the only one anybody got an amen you know we can be so happy but then we look at certain parts of our lives and say why doesn't this change remember all those questions God gave to job the questions promote Fellowship it promotes conversation with god amen hallelujah that's why God makes us that's why God lets us go through that so we can ask questions meditate on the things of God didn't David say I meditated on the word of God day and night and now because of like that I'm a tree planted by rivers of Living Water amen and my leaves don't wither amen because I'm meditating on the of God how does my life how does this how does my life fit the word of God why is my life going this direction and you just think about the scriptures all the time Church keep thinking about it one of these days a revelation is going to drop down from heaven Hallelujah and you're going to know why God has allowed you to go through some suffering or some questions why does my life have to be like this I would do anything to change this yet it doesn't change see we got to trust in God we got to trust Accord to according to God's choosing God chose this God allowed this and the church said am think about that area maybe areas of your life that are difficult did God allow it well yeah that's right that's right so then we have to accept that and God called you he elected you to stand amen he elected you to stand in your difficult situation in your life to stand for the truth of God hallelujah thank you Jesus so we see this Paul says before Jacob or Esau did any good or evil God already had chosen Jacob because he knew Jacob would have a desire for the word of God that's right Church uh verse uh 1912 now look it even was prophesied H I love that even as a baby they prophesied the Elder Shall Serve the younger wasn't Jacob grabbing at his heel when he come out of the womb isn't that something I've seen eight babies born but I never seen that a hand come out first and say give me that give me that I want the birth right my look at that it was even in him in the womb see Church there was something in you from a child it was the calling of God it was the election of God you wanted a spiritual relationship with God so God gave it to you hallelujah amen amen and she even got a prophecy the Elder Shall Serve the younger Hallelujah I love this story what a beautiful story now verse 13 here's kind kind of where I want to get to by God's grace verse 13 I'll probably stop here in just a few minutes so give me just a I'm G try to bring it down to a close Hallelujah Romans 9:13 as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esa have I hated now church I I feel like I've got a new understanding on this I actually used to think like God was actually uh hateful towards Esau but as I read the scripture I find out God was merciful to Esau God was longsuffering with Esau and then when I look at these other scriptures I understand this and I found this from uh a commentator I think this is Albert Barnes or John Gil both preachers in the 1800s wonderful men of God but he he he comments on this verse and he says this this does not mean a positive hatred but that God had preferred Jacob and had withheld from Esau the Privileges and blessings which he con conferred on the posterity or posterity of Jacob right so and and now here here's some scripture to back it up it wasn't like God is smiling at Jacob I love you and then I hate you Esau that's actually that's contrary to scripture right and I'm going to show you some more scriptures now here's what the commentator said and this is true it was common among the Hebrews to use the terms love and hatred in their comparative sense where the former implied strong positive attachment and the latter not positive hatred but merely a less love okay so the Jews would say love and hatred love is is all your love but hatred doesn't mean you hate them it just means less love and let me give you some examples so you'll know right this is undeniable because it's the scripture and of course what does this do church this magnifies God's grace this magnifies God's love and patience and longsuffering Hallelujah you want a good example how about this one Luke 14:26 you want to pull it up there Lydia good job on a computer back there all right now Lydia last say she reads this right see this blew my mind too as I was studying I'm like oh that's right I forgot about that verse when you get saved Jesus is not saying you know Zur you got to hate your mom that's not what he's saying God wasn't telling me Jesse you got to hate your mom and dad that's not what God was telling me the church said so see so see it's it's a common Jewish custom just to use just to use love and hate where hate doesn't mean like you're you're angry with them it just means not loved as much right right so if any man come unto me and hate not his father mother and wife and children Brethren and sisters yay and his own life also he cannot be my disciple so malind L please don't hate me and your mother okay I want you to serve Jesus but don't hate us okay you understand what I'm saying see see Church like you see um you know another word for this might be hyperbole as well some sometimes that word is a good word too yeah it's just trying to show yeah very good brother this extreme contrast like Jesus said if you can't stop lessening he said pluck out your eyes well he's not really saying like you should do that or cut off your hand if you can't stop stealing I mean he's going to this he's going to Great Lengths to say you've got to be a changed person amen you got to get a new heart Hallelujah you don't got to get rid of your body you got to get rid of your sinful desires you got to crucify the lust of the flesh lust of the eyes pride of life You Must Die daily Hallelujah Church the more time you spend in prayer the more Victory you'll get it's just like building good habits you get a good you get a couple good days in a row you're going to be flying high in the spirit Hallelujah is that right church just get a couple good days you'll see you'll be walking we're we're walking the presence of God hallelujah God's moving God's blessing God's speaking God's ministering as we uh learn to to daily walk after the the the cross Hallelujah take up our cross so there's a good example there's numerous other examples Jesus said you'll love one master you'll hate the other right well I don't hate the school system I work work for that's my master right makes me work I'm a school teacher you know I mean I love I love Jesus but I don't hate my my job no I wish I could take more time off of my work but you see he's not telling me you should hate your job well then how am I going to show the love of Christ if I don't love my job you see you see now of course in this case he talking about Mammon right he's talking about money which is Mammon right but we don't have to just hate our money how many of you hate looking into your bank account online do you hate that well I guess you might hate it a little bit you you spend too much but you look at the look look look at the contrast here right so we can see it plainly uh Proverbs 13:24 he that spareth his Rod hateth his son but he that loveth him chasteneth him be times right the psalm is not saying you hate your children if you don't spank them like with real hatred it just means you don't love them like you should right because there's a lot of movement in the last you know 30 40 years not to use a rod not to use correction well those parents are going to pay for it they're GNA pay for it that's right and I'll just be honest I mean I didn't spank these guys too many times and look how they turned out pretty good by God's grace now we're like Lord willing now we can't can't predict the future we don't want to speak negative either but you know it just takes the love of God God's love there'll be times where God lead need you to chase them but somebody that doesn't that doesn't mean they just hate their child just means they don't love them the way they should so Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated it doesn't mean God hated Esau now God hates all sin right God hates all sin see so God wasn't you know so God just wasn't looking at Esau I hate you I hate you I hate you and I love you Jacob that's the way I thought before I'm just being honest I'm I'm growing and because of these scriptures because of Luke 14:26 Jesus is not telling me to hate my parents he's telling me I got to love Christ more than my parents right Hallelujah Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated Church you know what the heart of God is the heart of God is what we saw earlier I wish I could be cursed so other people could be saved how do we know that's the heart of God because that's what God did to Christ 1 Timothy 2:4 Paul says it who will have all men to be saved and come unto the knowledge of the truth so God desires everyone to be saved God wished Esau would have got saved now we know he was lost the Bible says he's lost right the Bible warns us in Hebrews 12 and other places he was lost he did despite he did the opposite of the spirit of Grace he trampled underfoot the grace of God during his lifetime he made a public show of it openly and and he uh smashed it with f figuratively with his feet he trampled on the grace of God I love this one I forgot about this one but I heard a preacher say this Ezekiel 33:10 I'm gon to skip actually I'm skip Ezekiel 33:11 say unto them as I live sayeth the Lord how many believe he's alive tonight I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked God does not Delight in Sinners ding but that the wicked turn from his way and live turn ye turn ye from your evil ways for why will you die oh House of Israel remember I brought this up Sunday look up look up here here's the vessel of Honor glass here's the vessel Of Dishonor we're just going to drink this and throw it away right but God wishes this one would be right he doesn't enjoy when this gets tossed away he wished it was like this that's his that's his fatherly heart that's his loving Creator's heart his heart aches just like Moses's heart achd just like uh Paul's heart ACH how about Stephen Lord lay it not to their charge while they're throwing the stones at him how about Jesus father forgive them they don't know what they're doing right by God's grace we need to extend that same love and compassion to our enemies too God's saying turn turn turn from your evil ways right to all the evil people today right turn from your ways uh Barack Obama right right Joe Biden Mitt Romney I mean you just name them they support abortion and wars and death the blood's on their hands turn and God's saying Turn Turn I don't Delight when they die without repenting that's why the Bible said pray for all the leaders that are in leadership over you Hallelujah now Church what's amazing here God the Bible said I have no pleasure in the death of Sinners but God did have pleasure in the death of Christ now you talk about a Divine love Isaiah 53:10 yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him you talk we're talking about a different kind of love here God God hates to see Pharaoh get a hard heart right and God had to harden his heart because that that that's what Pharaoh wanted God knew he would never return but it grieve God to do that but then it pleased God to put all your sins on his son amen praise God that's Divine love church that's amazing love that's eternal life that's eternal love Hallelujah am I have no pleasure when the wicked die but I do take pleasure in putting all the sin on my sacrifice for the joy that's set before Christ hallelujah amen hallelujah he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand what the children of God Amen that's the pleasure of God so it pleased God to bruise Christ so he he would have the pleasure of having his family all those thoughts in his mind Hallelujah he just wanted to see you manifested and giving God praise and singing there's joy in the house of the Lord amen God just wanted to give you want to see you worship and get some gratitude tonight and sing about the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and thank God that nothing can separate us from the love of God hallelujah that pleasure so pleas him to put your sins on Christ so he'd have the pleasure of enjoying your worship and your fellowship that's love but he takes no pleasure when Sinners die takes no pleasure in that quite a quite quite a scripture is that quite a scripture Hallelujah let me close with a few more thoughts here yeah I'm already almost done here few more things here let me read this Esau we all know church he had the birthright he was a hunter right now what I found this was pretty amazing what I found here let me see if I can get to that right spot you have to forgive me here I was looking for a comment here I might just have to go by my memory here I got my notes thought I had my notes down here oh yeah here it is I want to read you some history about Esau some Jewish history I just had to go a little bit lower here Esau had the birthright and by this Birthright he had this Superior rank in his family he was number one in this family he got a double portion of his father's inheritance he got the Priestly Office of the family according to numbers 8:17 and 19 he was the priest of the family so the religious leader and he had the promise of the seed to come through him Christ in which all the nations of the earth were to be blessed Genesis 22:18 and he sold all that out for one bowl of pottage now here's the history I didn't know but it agrees with Hebrews 12 see if I can find this here yeah Jewish tradition says this and this this author John Gil he cites he has the the books of the Jewish historians he said on the day Esau sold out the birthright he committed five transgressions that day so no wonder he would sell out the birthright history says the Jewish history says he laid with a virgin betro so he took another man's wife and the reason that's proven is Hebrews 12 it said he was a fornicator and a profane person but that's not recorded in scripture what's recorded in scripture is that after Jacob gets the be blessing he runs out and marries two Canaanites just to spite his parents and then he comes back and marri's an ishmaelite so he's got at least three wives so he does it on purpose I'm trying to I'm trying to spite my parents right see on purpose but I didn't know about this's other stuff no wonder he so easily sold out the birthright he had all those demon spirits on him right fornication a perverse Spirit right Spirit of fornication we' say a hor mongering Spirit right so he's Anointed with a hor mongering Spirit he took another man's wife a virgin he killed a person right and that that makes sense historically because as soon as he found out about Jacob he wanted to kill Jacob Jacob wasn't the first one he wanted to kill he's a murderer right in a murderous heart third thing now this is I don't know this one um where is it okay uh fifth one I lost my spot oh yeah okay yeah it says he denied the resurrection of the dead I'm not sure what that stands for and then he denied the root the foundation and then he despise his Birthright and he even desired now this says he desired his father's death because remember his father couldn't take back the blessings once he blessed him he couldn't take him back and then he sought to slay his brother that same day so all those evil spirits were on him no wonder he said I don't want to go to church and worship right I don't want to intercede I don't care if the Messiah comes for me he just laid with the woman he just wants to kill people he's got all these all these evil spirits on no wonder he doesn't want any connection to it but Jacob's the exact opposite Jacob's like I don't have it I want the Messiah to come through me I want Jesus to come through me hallelujah hallelujah praise God I want God's blessings in my life Hallelujah I want the lineage of the Messiah to come through me praise God I want to be a spiritual leader how many want to be spiritual leaders in your family you all of you are right if you have a house husband or wife you're a team of course the man's the ruler but the Bible said the woman guides the house while the man's out working right Titus Chapter 2 see she's a leader one way leads the children but see I didn't know that now go to Hebrews 12:16 before they were born God knew he would desire these things so that's why he elected Jacob actually let's go to verse it's beautiful verse verse 15 Hebrews 12:15 looking diligently lest any man fail the grace of God so see Church you got to look really diligently at the word of God like most people just go to church on Sunday even if they do that or Saturday night Catholics right and that's only for 45 minutes you'll come and sit through an hour half sermon brother Saints I what I preached two hours on Sunday didn't I preach two hours on Sunday and you sat through all of it and it just felt like 10 minutes right is that right hopefully for most people I paid for it on Monday probably still probably still paying for it right now Hallelujah but I love the word of God I'm want to give myself to it if this you know it's it's light afflictions Hallelujah light afflictions but look see if you want the grace of God you got to look diligently at the grace of God in other words don't let Satan tell you you're a vessel Of Dishonor you're not you're a vessel of Honor Hallelujah that's why you're here tonight you're looking diligently at the grace of God hallelujah how many want more go of God's grace in your life am that's why you're here you're looking into it you don't want God's judgment you don't want God's Wrath you want God's mercy Hallelujah and thank God he's rich in it Hallelujah he's got enough for me he's got enough for you he's got enough for you he's rich in Mercy plenteous in Mercy Hallelujah he's got an overflow of Mercy sisters there plenty for all of us hallelujah is that right AAA plenty of Mercy plenty of Grace Hallelujah and he pours it out upon us hallelujah nobody can put any charge to God's elect we'll judge the Devils we'll judge the Angels Hallelujah we'll condemn the world the Bible said with our lives lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby may may be many be defiled see we can't get bitter with people we got to be loving with people what happened to Esau he got bitter with his brother I'm GNA kill that man and so Rebecca says go run away go run away I love how God does it God brings them peace at the end of their lives right before their daddy died right and then their last meeting is at the very grave of their father love you brother love you the same guy that wanted to kill him now he's hugging on his neck and crying let me bless your children can I bless your wives can I bless your children is our last meeting God is the master of changing Hearts Hallelujah God can take a murderer and God can take that murderers out out of him and make his love make him love his enemy Church man Hallelujah he can make a murderer love his enemy Hallelujah that's the grace of God to us but what caused at the beginning bitterness well you're the one who sold it out you're the one that that took the betrothed woman you're the one that murdered there's consequences to your actions verse 16 lest there be any fornicators so that's where the Jewish historians get this he he took another man's betro wife for that's fornication right any act before marriage is fornication any act after that's not with the spouse is adultery or profane person as Esau who for one more more so of meat sold his Birthright for you know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears and so we know what does that mean it means he had worldly sorrow and not godly sorrow he just felt bad Paul said Paul said there's two sorrows and I've seen it I prayed with one man here an hour and a half and then another time I prayed an hour and a half with there he cried for three hours straight saying he wanted to serve God I walked out I went the next day I saw him he was at Bible study the day after that he was out smoking weed again and sleeping with all kinds of girls now he's got almost uh six children by five different women and I thought for sure praying three hours with somebody All Those Tears I thought for sure something to happen but when there's no change of life it's called worldly sorrow they're just sorry they got caught they don't want to change but thank God we're changed thank God Amen that he can write the word of God on the fleshly tables of our heart Hallelujah and so Esau's crying but just because he lost the money right now God did still bless him later but he didn't get as much as Jacob see he cried for all the wrong reasons that's right Church though he sought it carefully with tears let's stand to our feet here musicians can come lot different than Sunday huh but how many know it's needful too how many believe Romans 9 is thus sayith the Lord too everybody believe that you you believe chapter nine just as inspirers chapter 8 Hallelujah it is church what does this encourage us to do be the Jacob amen be the child of the promise of God am don't let roots of bitterness to spring up in our hearts because that defiles many people that's why I told you even these there's a certain group of preachers in the message they call themselves The Greatest preachers of all time but I've got to be careful I've emailed them I tried to contact them I got to be careful not to get bitter towards them God is my witness I know this is live I'm being honest there's my hour you know uh and you know and think about it we got to be careful not to get bitter with our family our church family because that can be a root and if you don't uproot that it's going to defile lots of people create in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit within me and I love the story of Jacob no matter how bad he was at the beginning God knew he'd want to wrestle and get a changed life God knew there would come a showdown where I've got to be a different person I can't live like this anymore I need the Holy Ghost Hallelujah I need the Holy Ghost I need a change God knew that moment would come and God let Jacob Prevail over the angel to show him that God's word prevails that God can change a man God is the only one who can Prevail over the will of man because his will is greater that's the reason I got saved his will is stronger amen that's why I got saved how we thankful his Will's stronger tonight let's bow our heads Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated let's not forget God Wills that all would be saved God does not Delight in the death of the wicked he's a god rich in Mercy with our heads bowed how many would say brother Jesse pray for for me that the Lord would create in me a clean heart that I have no roots of bitterness spring up in my heart God sees the hands I'm not looking but God sees let's pray together church here Heavenly Father we are children of your promise that's why we're here we're looking diligently at the grace of God hallelujah I see grace in Jacob's life he started off as a Shyer brother Bram said but he becomes a prince over time over the trials of life and being hunted down down and being uh tricked reaping what he sowed by his father-in-law Lord you bring him to a change in his life where he has an experience with the Holy Spirit hallelujah amen God thank you Lord you knew this the purpose of election had to stand and Lord we have a purpose that you've elected us to the Gospel of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen thank God Hallelujah Lord I ran for it for so many years Lord we ran from it but Lord now we're walking in the light as you in the light and

diligently looking at your grace let us remember there's no condemnation Hallelujah let's remember there's there's nobody that can lay any charge to our account Hallelujah if God is for us who can be against us but let us also remember Lord God Lord that we should hunger and thirst for the lost to be saved Hallelujah we should have such a desire like Paul I want to see these people saved I wish
