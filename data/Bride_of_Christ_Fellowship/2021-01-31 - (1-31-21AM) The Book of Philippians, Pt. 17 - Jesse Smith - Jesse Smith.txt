smell a sacrifice acceptable well pleasing to god but my god shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by christ jesus let's go to first samuel here 1747. for samuel 17 47. let's read that on three one two three and all this assembly shall know that the lord saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the lord's and he will give you into our hands let's have one more word of prayer if you have a need on your heart just make it known to god maybe in your home just raise your hand here let's ask god to minister heavenly father we again approach your throne of mercy to find help in the time of need and we just read it lord god you're going to supply all of our need and all this assembly like david's group there the believers would know that you save not with man's hands the lord with a supernatural hand lord god we thank you for that lord our hope our confidence is in you lord and father just take these words bless them to our hearts lord god give us your divine inspiration and revelation lord god you promised to finish the mysteries of the word we thank you for that so lord just continue revealing yourself to us lord god and may each person i pray be born again of the holy spirit and become a spiritual king and priests unto god bless your people here this morning in jesus christ's name saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god now we do we'll be doing a little bit of reading so if my children are gonna have their bibles handy um we'll be doing a little bit of reading from various portions of scripture so i'm going to try to preach off a smaller screen today just my phone so we read our text here and let's look again at verse 18. let me set a timer here also i just keep checking the roads there they just look great and the snow stopped i know it's supposed to start though later on i guess i was thinking this too you know i remember last year or maybe was the year before um i kind of learned the hard way to be more cautious on snowy days it was a wednesday night and uh you know it was snowing and i was like well we'll go to church anyway you know who cares you will make it well getting there was fine but getting home was awful um and uh we were on 76 and uh we started slipping and sliding and almost got hit by an 18-wheeler uh so that you guys remember that do you remember lydia remembers uh we came to a complete stop there was a the car in front of us just spun out almost completely and then got straightened out uh and then we came right to a stop and we actually bumped vehicles that's right we bumped vehicles and so from that moment i was like well i'm going to be more cautious if i possibly can when it comes to snow so that's why i'm a little cautious this morning um you know because i really was putting my own children in danger so god forgive me for that sometimes our zeal isn't always divine right and uh our human zeal eats up our divine wisdom so just thought i'd remind everybody that myself too so let's look to uh the scripture now the bible says in verse 18 philippians 4 paul said i have all and abound remember that means overflowing so paul had everything he needed plus extra i guess we find ourselves in that case this morning physically right but we know the zeal this age the warning of this age is not to feel like we have no more spiritual needs that's the great temptation of this age we have to make sure that we always remember we have need of more church we have need of more singing right more bible study and more preaching and more revelation that is the great sin of this age to say we have no more need of god there's no more revelation there's no more truth and that's a great sin when uh the people are rich and increased with goods and have no more spiritual needs we just read about that last night from charles spurgeon so that was a great thought uh out of the word of god but here paul's at a spot remember he would have fluctuate from having what he needed and other times he lacked a lot but the great lesson the prophet learned was to be content in whatever state he was in and so that's a great lesson even a 50 60 70 year old christian who's full of the holy ghost can learn that lesson to be content no matter what state we find ourselves in whether we got everything we want we don't have everything we want we like what's going on we don't like what's going on a great blessing of the holy spirit is contentment for godliness with contentment is a great gain so paul had attained great things had he not even in prison he had obtained great spiritual blessings so he says i'm full having received of epiphanitis so he was the messenger uh carrying the the message of his necessities right they were sent from the church in philippi the bible says and i want to meditate on this thought this morning so this is my major thought it's an odor it's a smell of a sweet smell a sacrifice acceptable well pleasing to god so again we find that the philippians here in sending money or food or clothing or whatever they could send to paul it was a sacrifice so they the philippians lost some of their money or they they gave up i should say freely gave up they gave up some of their money they gave up some of their food uh perhaps some of their own clothing they lost of their uh possessions that paul might gain and so paul recognizes this is a sweet smelling sacrifice unto god and it pleased god well amen it made god well pleased very happy and so we want to look at this thought now i want to just take that thought and i want to remember that uh this is a gift of necessity so we have to remember amongst ourselves sometimes we give you know we might give a christmas gift or might give something a birthday gift but it's not always a necessity right and so we want to remember real sacrifices uh you know they're they're they're sacrifices that help people's necessities that was in verse 16 paul said you gave unto my necessity and also verse 14 said it was to relieve paul's affliction so maybe it was even medicine that just thought just came to me there maybe it was medicine or some other thing paul was afflicted there in prison and so the philippians heard about it and they gave to his necessity and paul was full he was happy he was content and said that it was an act of worship and so this is what sometimes we often need reminders of is that giving to others is worship we got to be careful not to think well i went to church i did my worship well i'll say like this we did part of our worship when we went to church but there's certainly more worship we can do and paul ties this in to old testament sacrifices so we're going to take this morning's message and kind of review old testament sacrifices because now that i've studied more even on it i've grown deeper in my understanding in it as well so i hope it's a blessing this morning because the holy spirit inspired paul to say when the philippians gave to my affliction it helped my affliction gave to my necessity it was an odor a sweet smelling savor in the nostrils of god now figuratively speaking that's personification right to god almighty so let's uh quickly or not quickly let's briefly review the five kinds of offerings go ahead and see if you can name the five kind of offerings there in your home anybody name them here burnt sid yeah trespass so now i got four of them let's i'm gonna give him a cheer good job buddy nice nice memory there yeah there are five uh five old testament sacrifices as far as the worship now we gotta remember too there was a six we would say as far as the red heifer kind of made the way for all of them right because no one could even come to worship and and bring their goat let's say for a sin offering no one can even bring that until first they've been sprinkled with the red heifer right the at the waters of separation from the red heifer as we preached on numerous years ago now so let me just name all five again and uh by god's grace tell the meaning or the basic meaning of each one so the first is peace offering now this is a thanksgiving of any kind okay so it's a thanksgiving it can be any kind of worship or any for i'm sorry for any reason thanksgiving for any reason at all a second is the meal or meat as malakai said so it's the same thing now that's where it can be a little confusing because when we think of meat we think of chicken right or steak or hamburger something like that but in the old testament meat was just food in this case and so this was a a uh an offering for thanking god for the specific provisions of food and drink okay so this specifically deals with the provisions from the earth so the piece was thank you god for anything could be healing you know anything uh rain anything at all when they wanted to give thanks for food and drink it was the meal offering or the meat offering the third type was sin offering and a sin offering was an offering for atonement for any unintentional sins so this was unintentional so things you did that you didn't really think you did or you know the holy spirit brings it to your remembrance later ah that's right i did that or someone comes to you and you know shares a fault you committed against them and you didn't know it that's what the sin offering was for now trespass offering that was a sacrifice for atonement for your intentional sins so when you knew it was wrong and you did it we would call that iniquity right or uh a transgression like you did it on purpose so a trespass or uh another one is another name for it i'm sorry is guilt offering you know you're guilty and it was your fault uh you did it on purpose trespass offering for that one and then the fifth and final was the burnt offering and this was a sacrifice of total submission to god total obedience to the will of god it was a sacrifice you just made and said i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm coming completely uh to god i'm just giving myself completely to god okay so again peace meet sin trespass burnt offering now we'll get to at the end of the message but which one of these do you think paul was referencing i don't know for sure but i'll give you my thought at the end um i think it's pretty clear that once you really take a little time and think about it but again peace meet sin trespass burn offering all right so uh now let's take a little bit we'll look at uh some of these uh scriptures in regards to these offerings and i'm going to go over them a little bit more thorough here by god's grace to share a little bit more okay so the first is peace offering again giving thanks for anything i'm going to read a little bit out of easton's bible dictionary just as an overview this all the offerings were offerings made by fire you had to have fire to consume right that reminds us that god is a consuming fire so when we give our offerings in the spiritual we got to have the love of god the fire of god the spirit of god in our hearts right consuming our selfish will or our desires uh you know just consuming our minds right just consuming everything a consuming fire so peace is a peace offering is a fiery offering and it's of the herd or the flock it's a bloody offering okay and these are mostly detailed in leviticus 3 leviticus 7 is where you'll find most of these details now there's three kinds of peace offerings you had thanksgiving offerings of gratitude for the blessings received second was the fulfillment of a vow so you give a peace offering when your vow is fulfilled and also uh another one's called free will offerings and this is something that's spontaneously devoted for god so if you just uh happen to see the hand of god and you just want to give a quick a quick worship a quick thanksgiving that would be called a free will offering remember they did that in the days of david and moses they just kind of announced well who can give to the temple or who can give to the tabernacle and the bible says all those with a free willing heart came and just brought it right it wasn't it was just a spontaneous thing and so we can see that uh you know when something great happens or we get a little extra money or something we just want to give a spontaneous praise a spontaneous worship uh of a sacrifice that's a peace offering that's a that's a thanks offering attitude or an attitude of gratitude we'd say like that by the grace of the lord now second is a meat or meal offering and this is the only one we can find that wasn't bloody it still had fire and it's specifically called a sweet saver so maokai can you read leviticus 2 verse 2. he'll just read that one verse while i'm going to read this um the hebrew word denotes unbloody sacrifice and these were always accompanied with drink offerings so that kind of brings some scriptures to our mind like david doing a drink offering right or pouring out the water from bethlehem so meat and drink go together so that's not an extra one but they always went together in the scripture so malcolm you read leviticus 2 verse 2 and he shall bring it to aaron's sons the priests and he shall take throughout his handful of the flower thereof and of the oil thereof with all the frankincense thereof and on the pre-show burn the memorial upon the altar to be an offering made by fire the sweet savor unto the lord thank you so the bible says plainly this type of sacrifice was a sweet savor into the lord notice add flour salt and oil but there was no leaven and no honey so we see some of the uh symbols here right leaven represents sin see and then salt and oil you are the salt of the earth right uh oil represents the holy spirit again and flour and we all know how brother graham talked about this kind of uh meal offering but i talked about it with elijah when the there was death in the pot right and so they had to they had to add uh the good meal and brother ram said that it was adding christ he said because uh every all the every every uh every particle of the flower was the same size and brother and said that's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever so follow her flower was ground right until every aspect of it was the same and so we see that uh how this represents christ and remember every bible says every sacrifice points us to christ so we have peace which is bloody now we have meal or meat which is the only one that's not bloody there's no blood involved with this one and it was in recognition of the sovereignty of god and of the bount of his bounty in giving these earthly blessings okay and uh the dictionary says it always followed the sacrifice of blood and i like that thought blood had to go first right we couldn't worship without blood right so you just want to give you know like a meal or meat you'd always start with the blood there always had to be some type of blood offering as we'll show later the most common offering was a burnt offering it was the one that people did most they just wanted to show their total submission to god or surrender to god and so that if if you wanted to offer you know a meat or meal offering you'd first start with a burnt offering you know is the most common one so uh you can start seeing how each one has a specific purpose right and then how it relates to us right jesus is our peace he was our peace offering praise god and we give spontaneous praise to god for that right he give us peace and we give god thanks and we should always give god thanks praise the lord then we should have this meat or meal offering as well now let's look at a little bit of the drink offering here from easton's bible dictionary it was always combined with meat as we say and also presented daily at the tabernacle i think that's a great thought there too every day they had to have a meat offering so every day they had to make an offering of bread basically flour and wine because the drink offering was usually of wine we're not going to read it but it says it in numbers 15 verse 5 and hosea 9 verse 4. and so these were offered on every single day and uh on the sabbath and on feast days so this was a this was something they did daily at least in the tabernacle and so a way to give thanks so that means every day we should thank god like like jesus prayer give us this day our daily bread right every day we should thank god for the food and the the water and everything that we have and it should be a sacrifice from our lips we should say thank you lord most of us don't know want right some of us know a little bit of poverty but most of us don't don't know want and so we should not take it for granted we should give god thanks we should give god praise for this meal for this blessing for for this provision everything he's provided through the earth everything he's given to uh give us provisions for our family and and continue to live this earthly life we should give god thanks for that praise god okay here's a little bit more about the third one sin offering again fiery bloody and this one seems to be mostly bullocks and goats mostly bullocks and goats this is found in leviticus 4. and now it's interesting too this says there was a necessity of making application to it as often as the guilt of sin renews itself upon your conscience okay so whenever sin would become whenever yours you'd be more aware of your sin and it would renew on your conscience then you would go to make this this the sacrifice because you just become aware oh i'm a sinner and i've i've i've got to constantly remember that oh yeah i'm aware of my sinful nature oh it's been a hard week or it's been a hard month and so these these sin offerings were for that purpose as often as you remembered your sin nature you just want to say oh god forgive me uh thank you for pardoning my sins but this was especially now this one in particular was even magnified of course on the day of atonement right we went through that a few years ago with a day of atonement it was special uh sin offerings on the day of atonement and this blood once a year the sin offering was carried into the holy of holies and sprinkled on the mercy seat praise god so this was the great the one day once a year was the sin offering where that sin was carried in and forgiveness was obtained for every person in israel thank god that jesus did the great sin offering after he rose from the dead praise god the bible said he said mary touch me not i must have said to my father heaven must receive my sin offering praise god amen and then he come back and they could touch him and handle him but he first had to go and presented his body as a a sin offering for our day of atonement thank god resurrection was our day of atonement and 144 000 they're gonna have their day of atonement praise god when jesus shows himself to them and they repent of their sins they mourn from house to house remember the day of atonement it wasn't a feast it was a morning so there's not seven feasts there's five feasts right is the day of mourning where you mourned over your sin and and the blood of the blood of the the goat obtained complete forgiveness for the sinful soul so that's sin offering but remember you could do it whenever you wanted but there's a special day where that sid offering was magnified the day of atonement they were also on all five annual festivals they had those extra special sin offerings and also on the consecration of the priests they had special sin offerings as well all right fourth we have the trespass or guilt offering this was bloody and it's special it was only a ram you couldn't give a bullock you couldn't give flour no wine only a ram of course we know ram is a a male sheep right and who that represent jesus christ right so we had to specifically think of the the male sheep you could only do a ram on the trespass offering this is in leviticus 5. you can read it i read it this morning also i'm sorry leviticus 5 and all through 6 verse 7 and also numbers 5 verses 5 through 8 and in this sacrifice you have the idea of sin debt and the the legislation or the legal aspect that you owe a debt right we know the bible talks about that in the new testament as well about a sin debt and jesus paid the ransom of our debt that we owed against god for our sins that's why it's beautiful that jesus came as a ransom because of this jesus came as a ram a ramson we could say like that he came as a ransom uh to pay the price for our intentional sins thank god the bible said remember in isaiah 53 that he's taken all of our iniquities praise god all of us had iniquity all of us had sin all of us purposely sinned against god at some point and still do when we fall short of god's glory we know it's wrong to get mad and say that we know it's wrong to judge this before that we know it's wrong to take that or say that or think that we know these things are wrong but we do it anyway but thank god there's only iran that can take care of that praise god hallelujah jesus christ the mayo sheep the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world there's only one thing to think about with those sins the ram hallelujah ram pays our debts thank you jesus always a ram and it also says this is in uh special cases where sin was more private right it's something i did i know about it maybe i'm the only one who knows about it i need a ram for that situation praise god when some things are really personal to me church when they're personal to you we need a ram to stand in our place we need jesus christ in his power to stand in our place and take our sin our sin away our sin debt to just wash it all away thank god he legally takes it all the way the ram takes away all the legal aspect against us and we stand forgiven in the sight of god hallelujah thank you jesus praise god oh it's beautiful man these these are deeper this is deeper than i've ever gone into some of these uh or in all five of these offerings it's just beautiful only a ram can take those sins that we purposely do oh how we need jesus every hour praise god we just need him every hour fifth and finally there's the burnt offering saints and this was fiery and bloody uh the actual word means ascending so burnt is ascending and it was the most frequent form of sacrifice so the one you would your go-to sacrifice was lord i just i've given myself completely to you now doesn't that make sense because hopefully a real sincere jew wasn't purposely sinning all the time so thank god right thank god the trespass offering wasn't the most frequent one and if it is you got to go back to the sin offering and get saved or go back to the red heifer right so you can come and worship where it actually means something and you're actually clean right i think about that but this is the most uh the most often most frequent sacrifices god i just i just surrender everything god just i give all myself to you i give myself away lord use me here strengthen me help me and also me and it also was the only sacrifice that was completely burnt with all the other sacrifices some of it was eaten by the worshipper sometimes it was eaten by friends of the worshipper often it was eaten by the priests a lot of these were shared all of them were shared but not this one this was completely given to god praise god and that represents how we completely give ourselves to god there's some things that we reserve completely to god how many could say amen to that so anything related to jesus and this is important now because i'm thinking about jeffersonville but some things are reserved completely for jesus right he's the only one that's perfect he's the only one that has every word thus saith the lord right we we reserve praise for him we only we only worship jesus right we only we only uh magnify him we only exalt him we can honor people and give them respect but we reserve all worship for jesus christ that's why we got to be very careful all of our sacrifices and all of our worship only goes to jesus christ because this burnt offering is i'm fully devoted to jesus christ right yes yes we want to be we want to be uh we want to be faithful to our spouses and our home church and our friends and we want to be loyal right but this is saying a person is going to be fully committed to jesus christ they get all of the love all the attention all the submission right all the desires are given over to our lord jesus christ so hopefully that helps you now this is interesting the word burnt in burnt offering means ascending this is the ascending offering it's wholly consumed everything ascends up to god and it's the most frequent form of sacrifice in the lives of believers but also in the scripture in fact the very first sacrifices were burnt offerings by abel in genesis 3 4 rather genesis 4 it's called a gift right the gift that he offered so burnt offerings were gifts i just want to give this to the lord i want to give everything all every part of this to the lord jesus uh noah gave birth offerings i'm sure you've with that in genesis 8 20 come out and he gave burnt offerings he just wanted to give gifts to god thank you that i'm not in that ark anymore right the gender watch knows ark this week the musical it's a really nice musical i didn't watch it but they said it's really good and so one of the bad they had battles inside the ark you know not knowing if they're going to live or survive and so when they got out praise god lord we're fully devoted to you and we're giving you all the praise nobody ate of that it was all just given to god they were so thankful they just said god i've given you this gift it's all for your glory praise god then you see abraham do burn offerings in genesis 22. oh yeah that's what that's what isaac would have been he would have been a burnt offering and so we had to have a burnt offering that took isaac's place jesus christ our burnt offering praise god jehovah jireh i will jehovah will provide himself a sacrifice praise god now there's a lot on burnt offerings the bible said the tabernacle gave a continual burnt offering and that's a beautiful picture we continually give all of our will to god right that will do all the will of god we live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god there's a burst offering on every sabbath and every sabbath there was a double burn offering so that uh so a double expression right i'm fully devoted to you and that's kind of what we do right we give we give god the sabbath day our sunday we just give more of ourselves that day we give extra sacrifice extra surrender to the lord jesus christ there was a burnt offering of every month so every month they made a special uh worship thank you lord for another month it's a gift i'm giving you a gift because you got me through another month and they gave special burnt offerings at pen at passover pentecost trumpets and atoms it looks like every uh feast or holy day also uh these would be called free will burnt offerings as leviticus 1 talks about solomon gave many at his uh dedication of the tabernacle in first chronicles and when hezekiah reformed the church remember he was 25 and his dad died and he he rebuilt he he renovated the the church the doors the temple burn all the all the idols the bible said they gave multitudes of burnt offerings so it's like a fresh expression of god you're taking all of our thoughts you're getting all my time you're getting all my love you're getting all my worship saints let's keep giving god all of our worship let's keep giving a continual burn offering unto god god consume more of me take more of me i'm fully devoted to you i'm not devoted to this world i've got to live with the world i've got to abide by the laws but i'm fully devoted to jesus christ above all so these offerings signify the complete dedication of the offers to god and the dictionary says this is what paul refers to in romans 12 1 he said present your bodies a living sacrifice for it's your reasonable service so right so uh since burnt offerings were the most often sacrificed in a person's life um you know the the dictionary writers uh recognizing if we're going to give ourselves daily uh to renew our minds then it's like we're doing a burnt offering to god we're completely giving our minds over right we're completely yielding our bodies we're we're limiting our movements right we're being still and knowing that he's god we're just bringing everything to a focus on the lord jesus christ and saying i'm completely dedicated to you lord and i'm giving you myself i'm giving you my mind my body my soul i'm giving everything to you i present my body a living sacrifice transform my mind let me think your thoughts let my thoughts be illuminated with the knowledge of god hallelujah praise god now now here's why i want my children to get their bible so can you guys can you ladies and gentlemen because zion's not in here can you get your bibles here uh lydia can you do exodus 25 6 maokai exodus 30 verse 7. now i want to um kind of move off those five sacrifices and just look generally now at the scriptures about sweet smelling odors in the old testament okay because they're all those all those sacrifices those five plus no doubt the red heifer no doubt all of them were by fire and we know they were all sweet smell a savor unto the lord but let's look at other scriptures and other things that are attached to the sweet smell in the nostrils of the lord so we know um the first one is genesis 8. we're not going to read that but noah's burnt offerings the bible said they went up as a sweet smelling savor unto the lord okay so burn offerings so you know church when you're fully dedicating yourself when you are completely being dedicated and asking god to renew your mind and you're presenting your body of sacrifice then you know it's a sweet smell in the nostrils of god amen that should be every day praise god every day every morning it should be a sweet smell as you you humble yourself you quiet yourself you get before the lord worship him love him serve him say god just take this time and and unite my heart to yours when you do that it's a sweet smelling savor unto the lord praise god so that's the first one mentioned of sweet smelling savor uh so lydia now these two that lydia malek are going to read are by prayer okay so obviously you know you could you would attach prayer into your five offerings right you would be praying and talking to the lord and thanking him and asking for forgiveness so lydia exodus 25 6. oil for the light spices for anointing island for sweet incense all right and for sweet incense praise god of course this is for the tabernacle so sweet notice sweet well how do you know incense is sweet you gotta smell it it's a sweet smell it's not to be eaten it's to be burnt so this is speaking of sweet smell and that would be used for burning in the holy place so malachi exodus 30 verse 7 and aaron shall burn there on sweet incense every morning when he dresses the lamps you shall burn incense upon it amen every morning aaron was supposed to burn the incense represented every morning prayer hallelujah and it was sweet smelling savor unto the lord but there's got to be fire into it it's got to have all the ingredients right and it's got to be offered every day and that comes up as a sweet smelling savor unto the lord now lydia can you get leviticus 26 31. now before she reads leviticus 26 31 another one is exodus 30 verses 28 through 38 where god lists all the ingredients for the holy anointing oil which the bible says when that was put on when that anointing was put on it was a sweet smelling savor unto the lord oh my so do you see it and all these acts of worship whether we we're dedicating our mind to the lord whether we're praying by the holy spirit whether we're just anointed by god right just anointed for service it's all a sweet smell into the lord so if you say oh i feel anointed the holy spirit that's a sweet smell hallelujah god receives that worship when we're walking in the spirit when you feel the anointing when we're singing at church and worshiping and we feel the spirit of god and we're praising the lord and that's a sweet smelling sacrifice unto the lord so now we can see how singing and praying and offering sacrifices is all a sweet smell of savor unto god so leviticus lydia 26 31 this shows the negative aspect of false worship and i will make your city's waste and bring your sanctuaries into desolation and i will not smell the savor of your sweet odors okay now this is a warning in leviticus 26 31 that god's not gonna smell sweet savers even if they offer it so if they disobey god and if they're disobedient god's not going to smell it so no matter how much they burn or how many animals they're wholly consumed how many offerings god only sweat or smells sweet odors of obedience so god lays this in there now of course this will bring up the scriptures about obedience is greater than what sacrifice sacrifice so these all these all these sacrifices were just outward expressions of the inward inward grace that had been received in the heart okay that's a great scripture all the way now this is early right this is early with the law leviticus 26 is early in the law and god is already saying here he's warning them if you don't obey it doesn't matter how much sweet incense comes up or how all the all the fires that you make and all these acts of worship your worship is meaningless he said unless your heart's in it with obedience so may god help us to obey the word of god it'll be a sweet smelling savor unto the lord here's another one this is a great portion malachi hosea six four please hosea six four two hosea six four you can go to hosea six as well daniel joseph so find jeremiah isaiah ezekiel and daniel hosea yeah so i'm going to malachi read hosea 6 verses 4 5 6 and i'll have haven try a couple of those appreciate that now here this is of course the days of hosea many many years after moses i don't know i don't have my uh scofield bible to give you the exact dates oh yeah malcolm what's the date on jose there we go it's at the top of the page there's a date okay so 780 bc 780 all right this is uh 300 years or 200 years after david to give you a kind of a clue there this would be about like 800 years after moses so 800 years or so after moses hosea is given the word of the lord and this is what he says about sacrifices and sweet smelling sabers it's malachi i'll read verses 4 5 6 oh ephraim what shall i do unto thee o judah what shall i do unto thee for your goodness is as a morning cloud and as the early deal goes away therefore i few them by the prophets and i slain them by the words of my mouth and my judgments are as the light that goeth forth for i desired mercy and not sacrificed the knowledge of god more than burnt offerings amen now let's stop right there what a powerful scripture here god says your goodness is evaporated like the dew in the morning right that's what he says in verse 1. and then look at verse 5. look what prophets they're hewn out they're chopped down or cut out they're cut out of the blessings of god by prophets right there's 40 minutes man let me do a few more minutes by god's grace so look at what prophets part of the job of a prophet is to speak the word but if the people disobey it's like chopping a tree and uh the wood that falls out are the unbelievers right so the prophet when they don't he preaches it when they don't receive it the people are cut down their their spiritual life is stopped [Music] look at this i've slain them by the words of my mouth yet we know a lot of them are still living right so this is a spiritual cutting right this is a spiritual death these people are not alive spiritually they're dead spiritually they don't have faith they're walking in unbelief what what does that god's word it's god's word either brings life it brings blessing or brings death curse and he said my judgments are light of course exposing the darkness right but the darkness comprehendeth not look at verse six i desired mercy god desired mercy and not sacrifice and the knowledge of god more than burnt offerings see israel was still you know 800 years after moses they're still doing all these burnt offerings but god said i want you to live good lives right i don't want your goodness to leave he said i want you to continue all day serving me with a good heart and i desire you have mercy and not so much sacrifice they were good about the sacrifice in part another i said like this they were good about going to church but they weren't good about living it all throughout the day see the knowledge of god more than burnt offerings so god wanted them to understand god's merciful heart his loving heart rather than just well god said do this now it's time for trespass offering now it's time for sin offering now it's time for burnt offering they have the wrong attitude right they they weren't really worshiping god and obeying him from the heart we say they had bad hearts right because he said your goodness is evaporated okay so haven you can you read verse seven and eight try those isaiah six seven but they were like men that just get trespassed the covenant have they deal treacherously against me julia gilead is a city of them that work iniquity and is polluted with blood great stop right there so now god tells us why they've rejected god's mercy because they're transgressing the covenant they're breaking the covenant and they work iniquity that's when the that's the worst title someone could have is a worker of iniquity they specifically want to do works that transgress against the word of god right you were either workers of righteousness or workers of iniquity jesus said woe to the workers of iniquity he said i never knew you depart from me what do they do they they're spoiled with blood so they actually kill people physically right or their words we'd say kill people's character look at verse nine and as troops of robbers wait for a man so the company a priest murder in the way by consent these were evil leaders they put people to death i don't know if you saw this week but our current president signed more legislation supporting abortions overseas so just increasing death that's what this administration does increasing death now the previous administration didn't do really anything to get rid of it nor the supreme court but the point is death they love death and the bible says they commit lewdness so look at all these sins transgressions iniquity blood murdering now lunus is their sexuality verse 10 i've seen a horrible thing in the house of israel there is the whoredom of ephraim israel is defiled so basically showing all these sexual sins all these all this anger this murdering spirit the transgressions all of these are bad in the sight of god right and so it doesn't matter how much sacrifice how many religious acts you do all five or all six of those sacrifices if you count the red heifer it didn't matter what you what you did god didn't desire sacrifice so much as he wanted obedience he won the sacrifice of your will praise god god said i desire mercy not sacrifice and the knowledge of god more than burnt offerings okay we're getting close here oh a little bit further now that's all the scriptures that say sweet smelling savor in the old testament hard to believe but that's that's all there are let's look at some in the new testament let's go to second corinthians 2 14 and 15. i'll have lydia do that one malachi go to second corinthians eight one then haven can you go to ephesians five two if you got your bible sorry acacia ephesians five two thank you this is just i mean some of these are just beautiful scriptures uh they're just showing how our lives are continually it's kind of it's just kind of like we're a continual offering right we're we're a continual burnt offering unto the lord right it's just a continual sweet smelling savor our whole lives as we obey as we stand under the anointing of the holy spirit as we repent daily and try to follow god our lives are just continually we're just offering off this aroma in the in the nostrils of god and god is very well pleased by it of course you know we're his bride right we please him and so it's a it's a pleasing thing uh in the senses of god so yeah lydia corinthians 2 verses 14 and 15. now thanks be unto god which it which always causes us to triumph in christ and make it manifest the savior of his knowledge by us in every place for we are unto god a sweet savor of christ and then that are saved and then the perish wow isn't that beautiful the bible says we manifest or we make visible the knowledge of god and we are a sweet smelling sacrifice unto the lord unto all those that are saved did you catch that he said the next verse actually says if they're not saved it's not a sweet smell to them in other words whenever you're around a christian group you'll just love it because it's the same smell it's not a putrified smell right it's not a displeasing smell so children and myself all the adults we are a continual sweet smelling sacrifice unto god when we this is this deals with witnessing did you see that when we speak god's knowledge so when we witness like i got to witness this guy at work today just a little bit about that revelation with joshua how lord willing i'm preaching on joshua here pretty soon but joshua was getting ready to attack jericho and uh the angel lord came to him the captain of the lord's host and he's got a sword drawn and he's ready to fight you know he got us drawn ready for battle and joshua said are you on our side or their side and he said neither he said nay and that tells us that joshua had to learn god's not on my side i've got to stay on god's side right this is not my war this is not my battle the battle belongs to the lord praise god and so that just i was just witnessing that to that brother and he's a christian but i'm just witnessing to that and you know according to the scripture when we witness and talk about god's knowledge the bible said we just put off this sweet smell and if they're a christian they're gonna like that smell praise god we manifest it you and i manifest a good smell now in the natural sometimes we smell good sometimes we may not smell too good but in the spiritual we are supposed to smell so good that we're manifesting a pleasing atmosphere we're creating an atmosphere amongst the saints and amongst our family and wherever we go we are revealing the nature of god right the smell of god we'd say the presence of god the holy anointing oil of god our lives just emitted right we just emit that smell uh because we are a living sacrifice amen we're our hearts are burning did not our hearts burn as we talk with him along the way praise god we're just constantly burning and giving off the aroma of the holy spirit praise god america is in corinthians eight can you read verses one and five right now yeah one let's get down to five moreover brethren we do you to it of the grace of god but sterling churches in macedonia and this they did not as we hope but first gave up gave their own selves to the lord and unto us by the will of god great now do you get yet we looked at this last week paul's kind of emphasizing to the church in corinth that these philippians were very generous and the way they did it they first gave themselves to god does that sound familiar like a burnt offering they're wholly consumed they had to give all of themselves all their thinking all their time all their possessions they had to see all my possessions are actually god's because he gave them to me and then when you give yourself to god then god will lead you to give to other people okay now the beautiful scriptures here um they're all beautiful not so hard but now let's go to chapter nine second corinthians nine and i'm going to turn there too because i i just wrote down a couple okay maokai can you read 9 6 and 7. with this i say he would so sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he which soweth bountifully shall repost about his fleas every man according as he proposes in his heart so let him give not grudge or of necessity for god love is the cheerful giver amen so paul continues in the next chapter to tell the corinth uh corinthians this is how you grow in becoming a giver you've got to decide in your heart you've got to pray and decide in your heart and give whatever is upon your heart that's what you give and that's that's right right you give whatever sacrifice of those five in the old testament you would give whichever sacrifice was on your heart at that time whether it was a thank offering or guilt offering or whatever one it was you give that one that's on your heart and paul says this is how we give unto god we've got to see what god has placed upon our hearts and also he gives the law too if you only give a little bit of sacrifice god's not going to give much to you right you're only going to get what you give out so i'm thankful praise god thankful that we can keep giving to others and then god will make sure it comes back to us finances and our food and everything we have are seeds right and we can either keep them we can all keep them to ourselves or we can spread them out if we spread them out what's going to happen when you spread out your seeds this this spring what's going to happen they're going to grow you're going to get some fruit right are you guaranteed probably yeah unless there's like an awful winter storm or something like that or there's a dearth right you're guaranteed unless something awful happens you're guaranteed but let me tell you god as the gardeners much and as the great sender of all the types of weather he's going to water those seeds praise god he's going to make sure this the sun shines on him the water the soil so keep giving and then god will give it back to you the bible says that if you just do a few seeds you just get a little bit of fruit but if you give lots of seeds you get lots of fruit back praise god this is the lesson he's trying to teach remember we talked about that last week lord i want to grow in this i want to grow in faith i want to grow into utterance i want to grow in giving this is how you grow in giving you first give yourself to god you pray whatever's on your heart just give that's why it's good to practice continual giving now with our churches he's it's already set up ties and offerings but then we should also give other things too we'd also also should get in the habit of giving more money or giving food or giving of our time or giving prayer giving more of ourselves because whatever we plant that's what will reap now we get a beautiful uh a beautiful teaching in here as well now the bible in verse 10 says when they give they get back the fruits of righteousness so how many want to be righteous you got to plant seeds right you're the seeds of your sacrifice the seeds of your giving when you give seeds you get back fruits of righteousness now look at verse 11 being enrich in everything to all bountifulness which causes through us thanksgiving to god so did you get yet when we give out to others people give thanks to god right so when you give money or of your time or food or clothes or something that someone needs they'll they'll sit there and praise god and god gets praised because you obeyed his spirit right he led you to do it the people get it and they give god praise so god leads the giving and then god gets the praise for the giving he's behind it all he's he's just trying to do this great cycle of giving and receiving in worship right he leads you to give and give thanks god gets that then he leads you to this it's all god getting all the glory because the bible said it's everything is in christ and everything is through christ right we don't do anything for ourselves it's all from god and it all goes to god look at verse 12. this i'm just going to read this this this chapter is so beautiful i may have to stop here verse 12 for the administration of this service our giving is a service not only supplieth the want of the saints but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto god so see the more we give the more people give god thanks while by the experiment of this administration they glorify god for your professed subjection unto the gospel of christ and for your liberal distribution unto them and to all men so see people will glorify god when they say wow jesse gave this money or kristen gave this money or lydia or whoever it is malachi they're going to glorify god they're going to oh god you're so good you put it on their heart thank you for meeting my need [Music] but we've got to be liberal we've got to be givers we've got to be thoughtful about other people and also look at verse 14 and by their prayer for you which long after you for the exceeding grace of god in you then verse 15 thanks be unto god for his unspeakable gift now look at this there's the bible says there's one unspeakable gift that's god jesus christ we'd say is god's unspeakable gift because he didn't say gifts right he said gift so what is the unspeakable gift jesus christ it's jesus christ and his leadership right his ways the unspeakable gift is jesus christ leading you to give and then people give god glory people give jesus glory that you gave and then they can give right and then they can give to others and it keeps this beautiful cycle going of giving and supplying need and caring for others it's a cycle of love thank god for the unspeakable gift of jesus christ and his love praise god this is beautiful hallelujah so he has unsearchable riches of christ that we preach and jesus christ is also the unspeakable gift unsearchable riches from the unspeakable gift of jesus christ oh it's beautiful can't quite you can't even scratch the surface of it so great because remember many people will praise god for your sacrifices when you sacrifice and give something to other one the bible said they'll glorify god on your behalf and thank god for this opportunity that he gives us to help out other people hope our minds are thinking about lord who can i help lord help me to have an open heart who can i help out just a little bit if it's i can't do everything but the bible says help me to have a heart uh that can be moved by god because god loves what kind of a giver cheerful give it in a in a happy state give it with a smile on your face give it with uh join your heart knowing that god is going to be praised through this like i said i've of the times god has led me to give i don't think i had only maybe one or two people that have ever turned down the money really almost everybody they may say they don't want it but eventually they need it you know so many times it's god leading you to do uh cheerful giving and that will cause other people to glorify god all right haven uh i'm sorry yeah keisha uh moving on ephesians five verse two and walk in love as christ also has loved us and has given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweet smelling savor amen paul says jesus christ gave himself to god for us in love that's where it is right there praise god jesus is our example and the bible said jesus's offering was a sweet smelling sacrifice and savor unto the lord and that kind of goes with what we've been preaching on wednesdays about husbands love your wives amen praise god hallelujah boy it just ties the whole bible together glory that means in your home husbands when you're loving your wives you are emitting or you're burning and this incense is just going up towards god amen and sisters when you obey your husbands and everything godly your hearts are burning and there's coming up this great sweet smelling savor incense unto god hallelujah whether we're praying or not at that point right because the bible says when we manifest god's love and his spirit our lives are just this continual sweet smelling savor burning and and uh letting the smoke of worship and the holy spirit's anointing just come up before god and god smells it and is well pleased praise god all that does not tie the whole thing together praise god jesus gave himself as a burnt offering a sweet smelling savor out of love and husbands love your wives in other words our house is like a sanctuary praise god right it's like the old testament holy place and constantly and of course then you take the incense into the holiest of holies right so it's the old testament uh in a figure it's like an old testament tabernacle where we have justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost and our lives are burning for the with the love of god and it's omitting this beautiful smell this beautiful atmosphere of the holy spirit praise god a couple more here okay first peter 2 5 we're not going to read it but peter says we are a holy priesthood unto god offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ who were what was the office of the people that offered sacrifices it starts with the p priests priests so how do you know you're a priest you're offering sacrifices and there's all kinds right like we said with prayer with giving money giving food giving clothes there's all kinds of sacrifices that's how you know you're a priest you're constantly feeling how god is leading you and with a cheerful heart you give sacrifices unto god hebrews 13 verses 15 and 16 let's read that one lydia can you get that one hebrews 13 15 and 16 this is a beautiful portion of scripture where it again clearly tells us we're spiritual kings and priests unto god yeah 15 and 16 please by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name but to do good and to communicate forget not for such sacrifices god is well pleased amen so here it plainly says as priests unto god our words are so important we must give thanks from our lips and these are acceptable sacrifices the bible says it plainly now look what it says interesting forget not to communicate or give gifts right sometimes we need reminders right right it's easy to forget oh i gotta worry about other people so so often we're just worried about us and our bank accounts and putting food on the table but he says forget not so don't feel bad if you forget to help others right we're gonna forget that at times um but the bible says forget not to give contributions which pleases god okay think about other people these are pleasing things that we do as kings and priests unto god we do not just live for ourselves or to live for others and our prayer can be god show me the necessities that people have need of right show me what they really need and then i can help them out all right a couple more scriptures revelation 5 8 this we're not going to read it but it says prayers are kept in heaven in golden vials full of sweet odors so that proves it right there praise god our whole lives are like this beautiful odor being burnt up together and god collects all those odors right just like all the smoke goes in the atmosphere and all the all the carbon emissions they all go out in the atmosphere they go somewhere right so do your prayers so do your gifts to other people so it is all your sacrifice all you're witnessing amen like brother simon all you're witnessing it manifest the knowledge of god and it's a sweet smelling savor unto god anytime you sacrifice yourself or your husband or your wife any time you obey and anytime you love and it's hard and you sacrifice god receives that and he catches all that and the bible said they're in bowls in heaven we have bowls that catch the odors of our works that we do of worship when they're done with love praise god all right so now returning back to philippians 4 18. he said it's a sweet smelling savor the philippians gift for paul's needs was a sweet smelling savor unto god now which of those five now here's that well i mentioned the beginning which of those five sacrifices do you think it was now this is my opinion i could be wrong but i think it was the meat or meal offering i could be wrong but that's what i think why uh because they were providing for paul's earthly necessities he was afflicted whether by hunger we don't know or disease we don't know but he had needs and he was afflicted and remember he mentions that sometimes i'm hungry i'm content when i'm hungry when i'm full so i believe when the philippians sent that offering it was a meat offering unto god it was a meal offering lord i'm going to sacrifice this we're going to sacrifice this for our brother paul let it be as a meat offering unto you lord i'm just offering this to you take it and receive it in heaven praise god remember malachi read it from leviticus 2 verse 2 flower oil frankincense would burn and it's an offering made by fire of a sweet savor unto the lord praise god god providing provision remember paul said i'm really glorifying god because you guys are going to get a reward those bowls are going to get filled up in heaven praise god amen hallelujah so he said that's why i'm glad they said to my necessities and my afflictions not that i wanted your your food or your money but that you your bowls in heaven could be filled up with the sweet odors of your worship praise god last scripture we'll read for today philippians 4 19 but my god shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by christ jesus so paul takes this time and points out says thank you for all these things he said but don't forget god is going to supply all your needs i wonder if we could talk to all the saints who are a little older than us you know i wonder if we could ask them and say has god supplied all your needs what do you think they'd say i'm talking about someone 70 80 90 100. has god ever failed to supply your needs no because the scripture says my god shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by christ jesus what a confirmation so do you ever need to worry well if i give this i might not have what i need do you ever need to worry about that no no as long as it's done from a loving cheerful heart and even if you don't if you even if you lack something what can you learn you can learn well this is a state i need to learn to live in like paul i will i can learn to be content when i'm full when i'm empty when i'm hungry when i'm full when i abound when i lack i'm learning to be like christ by his grace let's stand here jehovah jair let's see that my provider word of prayer of course let's see the slow one then we'll sing the fast one but my god my supply of all your needs church according to his riches in glory by christ jesus he's the great provider he provides the water the rain he provides us with the seed he provides with everything the soil he's the great provider and he only asks us give your heart to him he said just give me your heart give me all your self then i'll put other people on your heart then when they receive it i'll get the glory glory that god might be glorified in all through all [Music] so let's pray for those requests for us that god will show us who has necessities god will give us a cheerful heart how about that let's pray this our heads here too heavenly father we love you lord god great is your faithfulness lord for all of my 40 years i can truly say my god has supplied all my need hallelujah according to my god's riches in glory by christ jesus thank you god for your amazing grace [Music] lord we just come humbly lord god we quiet ourselves we lay ourselves a living sacrifice on your altar we give ourselves to you lord we ask lord jesus open up our ears and our eyes that we can hear about people's afflictions and necessities that we can give whatever you place upon our heart we can sow seeds that you might give us more than we can keep giving lord god [Music] lord the greatest thrill of life your prophet brother branham said was a giving to others we bless your holy day lord let our hearts burn now lord god with his incense and father the sweet smelling worship may we offer these lord worship songs as priests unto god may our whole lives everything we say everything we do everything we pray may just be a continual burnt offering unto you lord lord some might have made a sin lord and a trespass thank you lord that there's a ram for them so lord if the saints need to do that lord may they bring a ram lord god bring the word of jesus your sin offering maybe lord just a thank offering for what we've heard today from your word
