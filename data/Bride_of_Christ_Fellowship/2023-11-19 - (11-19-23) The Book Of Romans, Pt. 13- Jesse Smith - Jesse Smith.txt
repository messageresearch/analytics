in the spirit of Revival every single day Hallelujah love how Sunday is a day where we don't got to work most of us you know we can just set aside and really be revived in the Lord hallelujah amen Romans 5:18 I'd like to pick up there by the grace of the Lord Romans 5:18 we'll just read that one verse I'll close the service with this thought of the power of one so I'm kind of like a subtopic The Power of One Romans 518 let's read that together on three 1 two three therefore as by the offense of one judgment Came Upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life amen may God has blessing to his work may be seise God so I studying yesterday and just felt you know inspired to get back to this uh series here by the grace of the Lord been reminded that I've gone through Galatians Ephesians Philippians Colossians and I thought well if I don't get back to this I don't know when I ever will by God's grace and then I thought over the years how many different battles or how many different uh trials have we over have you maybe you but definitely I know for me how many trials or how many answers to questions have I had just by preaching through every verse in these books I was thinking about when your dad was healed the first time there that was through the book of Philippians how Colossians has been such a help you know with uh forgiveness of sins and the blood of Jesus Christ and the godhead I was thinking of all the different testimonies and I just thought well I better get back to this here by God's grace and I just want to end with the power of one uh by the end here so I have some uh quotes here to show by the grace of God again we're thankful for all the efforts today we're thankful for all the saints be in the house of the Lord thank you while I was out for everybody who played their part I especially thank brother amen for doing his song leader and all the uh people back there you know she's been computer workers back there but everybody all the saints come into the house of God supporting both Services by the grace of God well the Simon sent me a text and he said uh he said I just love the people he said you got a special group of people I said that's that's right I'm very thankful God gave us a God gave us a bunch of gems here by God's grace I like to call it the cream of the crop you know not in Pride but uh uh just it's God's election yeah God's love is elective love brother Simon even mentioned that God's love is elective and then I sent him a message and he said even a quote I sent him helped him out where I I he said he never seen it before when I shared it with him that how the the refilling only comes in the mind he sent me a message this week saying thank you brother I never saw that before brother Jesse to you sent that message there so I like to see how iron sharpens iron don't you Simon always bring something i' never seen before like the hills and Valley sermon so many different messages he's preached that have been so wonderful and then I like to see how we can be help to one another by God's grace so I want to look at again I just going to briefly uh review here just for a few minutes here we'll kind of see how this serving goes I was telling brother Austin and I've told the church you know numerous times I don't have to preach an hour and a half you know if we want to spend more time praying at the end we can definitely do that but I was texting about that this week with brother Austin if anyone has certain requests or desires I can definitely preach less I don't really have to go and a half I just found it strange last week I preached in Junction City it was exactly an hour and a half I said I told those people I said we only got one service I'm not even looking at that clock and they all kind of laughed but then when I closed I look down oh it's been an hour and a half so just I guess you just get in a pattern you know get into maybe a I guess maybe I get tired after 90 minutes or something like that so but remember let's look at Scofield's outline of Romans you know we're on this third part now we looked at the introduction the whole world is guilty before God uh justification by faith is is the solution I'm going to fix that right now I keep forgetting to fix that is the solution Hallelujah um for your guilt for my guilt justification is the solution he declares us righteous through US sacrifice Hallelujah and now we're looking at the crucifixion with Christ we're going to look at that today maybe by God's grace and the Believers walk in the Holy Spirit this goes up to uh from chapter 512 all the way up to 83 this is a longer section and I just think it's supernatural I preached a lot on Romans 8 these last last year and a half with dancing and just the freedom over uh sin and and remembering what the spirit of God has done for us it's done amazing things praise God and then we see the final result of the Gospel blessing God's promises to Israel and tonight in the evening service I'll teach the children about Israel which I'm just going to kind of use that as a chance to go through the the order of end time events I've had numerous questions about it I was asked last week there are Junctions City and I just it was just impressed upon me wow there's way more events than I thought there's so many more verses especially from the Old Testament on Israel and then I thought you know while U you know I hear different message preachers I like to pull on their gifts as well I heard numerous you know message preachers say the Rapture is so close now now now remember two years ago it was just days away or seconds away so now it's you know in their thoughts it's milliseconds away um we'll just see you know I just differ with them I feel like God would let us know if it's that close uh and they say well they have no scripture saying there's time left well there actually is scripture there's definitely scripture that needs to be fulfilled we know talked about Jesus talked about with the birth pains and the bride being forced to stop preaching that still needs to be fulfilled yes other scriptures about Israel that's what I want to kind of get into tonight uh by God's grace more scripture for Israel so uh we just want to be ready for the coming of the Lord and I believe God is making us ready Hallelujah uh but you know with all these different preachers saying things I just I kind of like to it makes me ask questions you know makes me pray to God helps me to talk to God more Lord is this really is this really the time as you've heard me said I was even praying it yesterday I think even this morning Lord just show me if the Rapture is going to be in my lifetime or not I've still asked God for that I still pray said God I'd like to know if it's my time or not I would just like to know how many believe God can give us our hearts Des brother Ram thought it would come in his day of course it didn't um but I just keep asking God those things because I just want to be ready I don't want to I don't want to fear I don't I don't want to put fear upon the people and I myself I don't want to be overcome by fear I want to be led by faith Hallelujah yes I want to walk in the spirit I don't want to walk in a spirit of fear I want to walk in the Holy Spirit Hallelujah I want to redeem the time because the days are evil now remember this this book of Romans had a major impact on the last three Church age Messengers you know some historians say uh Martin Luther probably outside of Christ has had the greatest impact upon the church now I would argue with that I would probably say St Paul but maybe if you're talking about people that didn't write the Bible you know because Luther uh his his Reformation it opened the doors to everyone else in other words the Bible says uh you know we're all building upon the foundation that Christ laid Christ is the foundation you know Paul Peter James all the New Testament writers but here you know towards the top Luther lays down his ministry and now you know it just makes sense nobody's Ministry can have an impact without the the foundation of Luther right right but that's based on the foundation of Paul praise God yes but it's just amazing to see you know the impact that the book of Romans had on Luther Wesley and Brandon Hallelujah brother Brandon being our church age messenger I'm skipping down to the blue Park uh this is a historical thing uh when Martin Luther came to a fresh understanding of the book of Romans he said when I understood this text the doors of paradise swung open and I walked through hallelujah amen it was the book of Romans that awakened Luther to the doctrine of justification by faith alone and for persuaded him that this was the article upon which the church stands or Falls praise God how many feel like you're living in Paradise Hallelujah even in Satan's Eden even in leoda you feel like you're walking in Paradise how can you feel that way because you're seated in Heavenly places The Book of Romans unlocked that to Luther he says now I'm living in a spiritual Paradise here but where do we go after we die we go to the the real Paradise this paradise changed locations it used to be in the heart of the Earth but now hallelujah it's in the third heaven hallelujah amen it's up there uh near the Throne of God hallelujah but Martin Luther said I walked in a spiritual Paradise after God gave me the revelation of justification through the book of Romans John Wesley got saved reading and hearing a sermon on the book of Romans so what can I expect as we preach the book of Romans I know it's already done great things for brother Austin we preached on Abraham remember that brother you were texting me about that remember that during a sermon a powerful uh verion came to John Wesley he s he felt he said he felt his heart strangely warmed oh God give us a heartwarming service today amen let this service not be in vain hallelujah amen like Wednesday night was a heartwarming service Hallelujah every service last Sunday should have B every service should be a heartwarming service amen amen our hearts are drawn closer to Christ and that sermon was from the book of Romans now remember brother Adam said every time he got a little depressed he turned turned to Romans chapter 4 and he said uh he he said he staggered not Abraham stagger not the promise of God hallelujah every time I feel a little down you know what I do I put on a little music Haven was telling me I started in my in my office I started just playing music as soon as I get home I plug my iPad in and just start playing music Haven said yesterday she said I really like that atmosphere Daddy I said that's why I'm doing that that that that Spirit I'm sorry that Spirit of worship brings me out of my trials amen refreshes me Hallelujah I'll say every time I go to feeling a little awful what do I do I crawl up here to the altar I crawl into my prayer closet and cry my way to a closer walk with God hallelujah praise God Amen that's right brother said uh the Ephesians and the Romans Paul wrote These great deep messages that are the Deep things of God how many like the Deep things of God remember just to have skin milk uh it's it's wrong to remain in skin milk everybody has to start with skin milk but if we forget we're saved if we forget what baptism is if we forget uh you know just the simple things of God then we have we have fallen short as Christians we backed and it's time to get the discernment back in our lives amen we we've let some something sinful in our lives right we haven't discerned good and evil in our daily life and we we back it into an immature or childlike condition but we should be mature able to teach others also praise God like my barber uh texted me uh him yesterday but he texted me last week he said what are you making of all this Israel thing he said is this the end of and I sent him you know this five minute message and he said wow he said you really are a preacher I said I said well I'm glad you can see the Deep things in my life now see if I wasn't deep I'm talking about mature if I wasn't mature I wouldn't be able to answer his question right I'd say well I don't know either I don't want to be those kind of preacher I want to be a mature don't you want to be a mature Christian Jesus said be therefore mature hallelujah amen amen even as your father which is in heaven is mature how that clap is that too loud lady okay you feeling okay today all right praise God I didn't want to clap too loud but I like this Paul could write people deep things because they live deep amen the Corinthians couldn't handle the deeper things of God so we should be able to handle deep servants praise God Amen like the law of restoration Hallelujah like the hither to God yes amen like praising his name in the dead Hallelujah I forget cam Saturday night service I forget the title of that one but those are Revival messages praise God we should be able to receive the Deep things of God hallelujah am and we do by the grace of the Lord we're not babies and then brother am said I was reading in Romans 4 again where Abraham staggered not at the promise of God and he said he said we know Abraham many times got flustrated but God didn't mention his frustrations amen hallelujah he never mentioned them at all Hallelujah in heaven God is not going to mention any of your shortcomings Hallelujah he's not going to remember any of your mental backslidings Hallelujah not even mention praise God Amen all he's going to remember is that you didn't give up you staggered down you kept fighting the good fight of Faith you press on until you receive the crown of righteousness that's in the Book of Romans amen you said that's the way I hope mine will be written up too see there's a there's a Divine story about your life brother they amen Hallelujah brother Austin brother Jose Malachi there is a Divine commentary about your life in heaven it's called your book hallelujah amen and all your mistakes will not be in there just what you tried to do for God that's what be recorded in your book Hallelujah that's what Abraham's book had and you're the child of Abraham hallelujah amen now remember just briefly remember uh Claudius had banished all the Jews around 49 ad and and then they came back uh around 54 ad and so when the the Jews came back they found the church in Rome in a in a in a strange condition there's a lot of misunderstanding so Paul wrote this letter around 57 to 60 before he arrived and he was trying to get them straightened out uh the purpose again he was trying to unite Jews and Gentiles in the gospel Hallelujah I'm going to skip past that because I want to read what scoffield said I like what Scofield scoffield said the theme of Romans I've never I haven't preached this yet is the gospel of God the very widest possible designation of the whole body of redemption Truth for it is he with whom is no respect of persons who is not the god of the Jews only but the god of Gentiles also amen think about that God loves you as much as anybody else praise God that's encouraging us but if we're a small church God loves us just as much as the big church amen and God will not respect them more because they're bigger nor will he respect us less cuz we're smaller God loves us all praise God his Spirit can move through all of us praise God that's right amen there is no respector a person with God all the world is guilty but Redemption is revealed as wide as the need upon the condition alone of Faith Romans also embodies the fullest way the doctrines of Grace in relation to Salvation in the three remarkable chapters we haven't got to those yet and the great promises to Israel are reconciled with the promises according to the Gentiles and the Fulfillment of the former shown to await the completion of the church and coming of the deliverer out of Zion in Romans 11 I love this the key phrase is the righteousness of God hallelujah it's not the righteous of brother Jesse or the righteousness of sister ACAA it's not that's not the key phrase the key phrase is God shares his righteousness with us God Amen it takes out all the legalism takes out all the fear takes out all the doubt takes out all the misunderstanding because we live by the righteousness of God Alone Now I I told you it was a short intro it was there now therefore as by the offense of one judgment Came Upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life let's all say free gift again ready free gift coming up on Christmas right how many think you're going to get a gift this year children you think you're going to get one are you going to pay anything are you going to pay me back for that gift Haven are you going to pay me back are you sure oh so you mean it's a free gift you don't owe me nothing back is that right Carris it's free you didn't do nothing for it it's free it's just because daddy and mommy love you not Santa Claus mommy and daddy uh can't watch you all the time but Jesus watches you all the time hallelujah our Everlasting father Prince of Peace Mighty God am amen Jesus God manifest In the Flesh he's the one watching day and night he's keeping a list amen thank God it's a gracious list amen thank God there's forgiveness of sins in that list but it's a free gift so salvation is just freely given all you got to do brother R said is receive it he said just apply it and brother Ram gave the example like marriage like I we married amen and ha and Austin and Lena after I married you you didn't stay at the altar you went home and became one I'm just trying to that's what brother said that's the illustration brother R uses for the gospel you just don't hear and it STS at church you take it home with you praise God you become one with it hallelujah amen you just don't hear and say well I believe I believe I believe who is my wife amen could have said that all day all day well you got to take her home right Austin could have said that all day I believe she's my wife I believe I believe that's that's fine but take her home amen yeah right become one be live live your life together enjoy life walk daily in unity that's what the the Holy Spirit wants us to do walk in unity with the Holy Spirit Hallelujah walk in the spirit every day take it home with you take it to work hallelujah amen first by one man's Disobedience many were made Sinners so by The Obedience of one shall many be made righteous so we get we get this compared contrast one man sin Adam caused all men to be judged and condemned one man calls it yeah thanks Adam well if it would have been you you would have done the same thing right would have been me I would have done the same thing but yet the contrast to that is one man's righteousness gifted all believers to be justified it was a free gift right so sin uh sin was sin was uh the Bible said the wages of sin is death we'll get to that here so sin was forced upon us but now we're given a free gift and it's not forced upon us we have to accept it Hallelujah one man's disobedience caused many Sinners but one man's obedience caused many righteous amen ah I think of that that picture there in Revelation 7 they asked the Holy Ghost asked John John who is this multitude he said thou knowest Lord and he said they're waving they're waving palms and everyone is robed in wi he and the voice said these are them that came and washed their woves right in the blood of Jesus Christ amen he said they're from every tribe every Kindred Every Nation every tongue who is this multitude this is The Blood Bought Blood Washed multitude Hallelujah all these were righteous because of one man and it wasn't you or me wasn't brother Brandon wasn't Martin Luther it was Christ hallelujah amen all this multitude that cannot be numbered they're all there we all get to go to heaven because of one man Christ Jesus Oh Glory remember that picture I showed you Adam brought sin in the world Jesus gives us victory over sin Adam uh many died because of Adam many live because of the grace of Christ Adam's sin causes condemnation jesus' death results in justification his Disobedience brings sin to many but Christ's obedience brings righteousness to many Adam's sin Reigns in death but Jesus's Grace Reigns to bring eternal life amen I love am plain scripture moreover the law uh entered that the offense might abound but where sin abounded Grace did much more abound so the law purposely magnified our offenses so that Grace might magnify Jesus's righteousness so God gave us 613 laws in the Old Testament on purpose to prove to us without a shadow of doubt you can't keep all of them Hallelujah and then they they have a daily sacrifice they had a morning evening sacrifice that was just for the temple just for the priest and then Believers could come in and worship there there was death all the time Bloodshed all the time Hallelujah I mean there was constant Bloodshed it's it's always a bloody mess but there's all this death and think of it Solomon I think he sacrificed 10,000 Rams 10,000 Rams think about this the amount of sacrifice that was put uh was put up before God by these Old Testament worshippers but the Bible said God did it on purpose to show us how much sin abounded but it also showed us the power of Grace Grace would much more abound than sin praise God wow think about it look at the world how many can see sin covering the world Amen sin is just flooding the world it's flooding uh the Internet it's flooding uh the the the schools the the politics it's flooding everywhere but the Bible said righteousness will abound more than that praise God oh and Jesus comes back amen we'll have righteousness all over the whole world will know Jesus hallelujah amen his righteousness will be Proclaim from every nation Hallelujah he'll rule with the rod of iron praise God if sin abounds this much how much more will righteousness abound Hallelujah that's why said don't miss that Thousand-Year Millennium praise God he said whatever you do make it to there in other words whatever you do be filled with the Holy Ghost he said never go to the white Throne judgment to be judged he said get filled now and don't you miss that great Millennial Reign praise God Amen that's what the Bible says the rest of the Dead live not until the thousand years were finished those that were not the Born Again those that did not make the first resurrection remember the law was the school Master to bring us to Christ that we might be justified by faith and not by our our righteousness and remember I just bring these out again because I love these verses God has forgiven all your trespasses amen he's not holding it against you right there it's forgiven everything he even nailed it to his cross they're taken out of your way so if the devil's trying to put your sins in your way today just just tell the devil you got to take them out of the way because Jesus took them out of out of the way praise God they can't stay there they can't stay in my view he's already taking them out of the way I don't see any sin in front of me praise God I just see Victory Hallelujah I just see Heaven Hallelujah I just see Victory I just see Joy I see eternal life praise God I see Jesus coming hallelujah it's out of your way your sins your past is not in your way Hallelujah your your pasts are behind you remember the scripture I preached it a few months ago God put your sins behind his back remember that one it's been a while it's been a while for me too but that's what he's done it's not in your way now there's consequences and things but your path in other words God allowed that and your path is going to be straight it's a narrow road that leads to eternal life but it's a narrow clear path Hallelujah there there don't have to be obstacles in the way he's taking it out of the way hallelujah amen all right now this was a great verse again let's review this one here we have my little children these things write unto you that he sin not if any man sin that's all of us we have an advocate we have a lawyer or a comforter or intercessor so see we get we beat ourselves up oh how did I sin how did but we got somebody trying to comfort us Jesus is trying to comfort us be encouraged just confess I'm going to plead your case and I've never lost a case let me remind you I never lose a case because my father's on the throne Hallelujah amen I'm the son and I'm family members with the judge amen hallelujah it's all set up so we can be forgiven Hallelujah so we can get a fair trial Hallelujah that's right I got jur Duty next month honey I forgot to tell you sir I'm as tell you now that's on my mind December 13th I got jury duty hopefully they cancel it but if you sin you have a lawyer or intercessor somebody can go to God for you and that's Jesus Christ the righteous next time I go to Junction I think I'm going to preach on the blood of Christ and kind of bring out some of these scriptures because then hopefully that will set them free more free from their legalistic background so if you sin you have an advocate he is the propit which means the appeasing Jesus made appeasing of your sins in other words now you have peace with Goden he's taken your wrath has been taken away and not for ours only but for the sins of the whole world think of that and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his Commandments there's 8 billion people on the Earth just now just now right how many billions or trillions have there been down Through the Ages and Jesus Paid It All Jesus Paid It all all to him I owe praise God sin and left the Crimson s but he wash it white as s hereby we do know that we know him if we keep acts 238 amen if we keep Malachi four five and six Hallelujah all the scriptures praise God Amen if we keep every scripture that proves you know him hallelujah amen you know people use that quote sometimes and they were criticizing brother BR they said brother you don't know the Bible real well brother R said yeah but I know the author real well right but people use that as an excuse not to study their Bible preachers are supposed to study the Bible Hallelujah brother was just saying he said I don't know all the theology I he said I don't know uh the book well like like you and your theology but I know the author real real well but the Bible says that no Christ is to know life Hallelujah to have life is to know Christ and we know brother R knew the scriptures better than all them Hallelujah he didn't have them all memorized and have all this the history behind it all memorized but he knew the Revelation hallelujah amen the revelation of Jesus Christ the gates of hell can not Prevail against that Hallelujah so brother did know the Bible better than them praise God Amen see you can't know Christ without knowing his Commandments and then keeping them if any man say I know Christ and don't keep his Commandments what the Bible said they're a liar they don't know Christ they don't have the love of God you should be happy you got the love of God in your life such Amazing Grace if you sin you've got a lawyer to get you out of prison amen out of complexes out of discouragement out of dep question you got somebody to get you out of there praise God am just keep his commands glory and I just couldn't you know I studying last night this morning I couldn't I can't skip this I almost every Easter I bring this up brother said Calvary is one of the greatest days three things have meant to us we could take hundreds but he said I've just chosen three vital things we want to look at what Calvary meant to us and look at this he said I pray my seron will condemn every sinner that's present not condemn to hell but just make you feel guilty right you know make every saint go onto his knees that's what I like to see when my sermons put people on their knees and me also praise God don't leave me out amen that make every sick person raise his faith to God and walk away heal like Jose hallelujah amen every sinner saved every backs come back and be ashamed of himself every saint rejoice and take new hold and New Hope am [Music] amen the first thing he says is that the sin question is settled once for all amen amen it's the greatest of all days he said Calvary the sin price was settled s second Satan's power was broken amen and now we want to see what we should do in return He said now the works that I do shall you do also now this is the third thing the sin question is settled you don't have to worry about Sin as far as in heaven you're forgiven Satan's power is broken over your lives second third thing now Christ wants to work through you to spread this grace to others Amen to bring the ministry of Salvation the Bible calls it reconciliation God wants to work through you to do that praise God Amen he says Healing The Sick raising the dead opening the eyes of the blind these Works shall you do also you'll do you'll do these if you believe you shall do works and then a greater than this shall you do for I go to my father a little while in the world won't see me no more yet you'll see me I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world I'll not leave you comfortless I'll pray the father he'll send you another comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the world cannot receive yet you can receive it so the third thing is the Greater Works was to have power in the church not only to heal the Sick by prayer cast out Devils by prayer but to impart eternal life to Believers so this is one Element now you've heard me say before I don't believe we can do greater miracles than Jesus I don't believe that right there brother R said it I know there's quotes on both sides but I'm saying with that one I like that quote better because who's greater than Jesus no one's greater than Jesus brother one place said greater means more just a number more miracles right but here's an interesting thought too where I could I could say Amen to this once Jesus left the Holy Ghost come and now the church could do Greater Works in other words while Jesus was alive people weren't being filled in their soul but now you can be build in your soul Hallelujah because the blood of Jesus Christ has forgiven and abolished all the sins amen amen so yeah I like that thought that's a good thought in other words greater as far as now the soul can be healed amen now eternal life can come into that Soul Hallelujah because if they get raised from the dead they'll die again right but if they get eternal life in their soul their soul will never die hallelujah amen that's what Calvary mat St Hallelujah amen it was given to the church to impart life he said it stooped it took a stoop to gred men and women and lifted them into a place to be Sons and Daughters of God to heal the sick and impart eternal life by giving the Holy Ghost to obedient Believers men who were once unbelievers be made Believers and impart spiritual eternal life Hallelujah that's the New Testament praise God eternal life can be imparted now next verse that as Sin hath reigned unto death even so Grace Reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ Our Lord so sin reigned for 4,000 years before Christ but now Grace has reigned for the last 2,000 years and will reign for all eternity Grace doesn't stop church after we die amen Grace doesn't stop after this generation Grace will continue Without End Amen in other words we'll be singing Amazing Grace brother amen all throughout eternity Hallelujah that song will never leave us will always Rejoice over God's Amazing Grace Hallelujah his unmar favor just get used to it if you don't like Amazing Grace it's time to like it praise God you're going to like it either now or later might as well like it now now moving to chapter six brother said what shall we say then shall we I'm sorry the Bible says what shall we shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound God forbid God forbid and this is what a lot of churches do they say you're saved you can live however you want this this is the calvinistic idea right Calvin's like if you just said one prayer no matter what you do you're going to be saved well we know that's wrong Jesus said if you don't overcome I'm blotting your name out right even though remember he talking to both Vines he's talking about he's talking to the True Vine and the false Vine in the framework of the church right and he said if you don't overcome in your church age your name spotted out thank God for overcoming power hallelujah thank God thank God we've got overcoming power to overcome Leia today Hallelujah how shall we that are dead to sin how many dead to sin amen it's dead right it's dead live any longer there in how can you live in something if it's dead right right right know you not that so many of us as we're baptized into Jesus Christ we baptized into his death Hallelujah remember church this is our baptism scripture you know we baptized brother Chris last year anybody else last year or was it earlier this year we baptized brother Chris I think it was earlier this year by the way he moved out to Arizona he said did he tell you that brother okay he sent me a text and he said he said with the conditions of the world uh he said moving out to his family in Arizona I said well we'll pray for you maybe he'll come back sometimes God sends people back from Arizona brother God is God is rich in Mercy we just keep trusting the Lord if we're dead to sin how can we live in it know you that that so so many of us as we're baptized into Christ we're baptized in his death so Christians must discontinue a sinful lifestyle like sinning the same sins every single day right we are dead to sin because we were baptized into Jesus's death Hallelujah therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death isn't that interesting I'm buried with him in other words you and I can relate as Christ was put behind the stone so is our old life put behind a stone oh like that song the things I used to do I do them no more amen is that true hallelujah it's been buried and baptism showed that baptism was the sign that I put that sinful life away from me and just as like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of Father even so we also should walk in the newness of life amen in other words always keep your walk new and freshh with God Amen praise God we got to find a way to make it new make it feel like it's fresh again I don't know about you but I feel like that every time I come to church Hallelujah I do I do now I got a battle once I get out those doors but while I'm here I feel fresh and new hallelujah amen I feel new and after those arrival Services I felt really new as well amen went home and more devoted Hallelujah keeping that up by God's grace amen hallelujah it's keeping that life making it feel new again and that's by confessing our sins to our Advocate I like when Simon sings that song I just want to talk to Jesus what's it called I must tell Jesus I love that song now I can't sing it because I don't know it but I love that song church that's all you got to do to get back in the newness of life I must tell Jes just tell Jesus what you've done tell Jesus you just need more grace right he'll plead your case before the father now for if we been planted together in the likeness of his death so if we've died to our past life we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection Hallelujah so if we've been baptized and and then no doubt we'll be raised like Christ was raised from the dead Hallelujah notice that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed which is abolished or severed from that henceforth we should not serve sin our old life is crucified right and our our all of our sins all of our past sins are destroyed they're abolished amen they are severed away like there's a circumcision type right severed away cut off no more right and we are not Servants of sin hallelujah praise God we not serve the devil we not serve this flesh body hallelujah amen we'll serve Christ we'll serve his purpose Hallelujah amen amen that's what baptism represented I was buried with him I was crucified him that's why brother R said you were there with him on the cross now really you you weren't right now you might have been in his thoughts right right if all God was in him then surely you know we were chosen in Christ so no doubt all the Believers down Through the Ages remember he died for the joy that was set before him which was seeing his seed according to Isaiah 53 but but physically you and I were in there we were still in the thoughts of God right but this is why brother ad say you you got to make it in your mind we got to we got to picture our minds that just as Christ died I died to my old life just as he raised I've raised a new man as well praise God is this is what the Bible teaches in other words if you've surrendered your life to Jesus Christ it's as if you were buried with him it's as if you were crucified with him praise God and now you're your body of sin think about that all the times I sinned from the time I was what three or four whenever I started sinting all the way up to when I got saved all that has been destroyed all the evidence has been destroyed hallelujah praise God hallelujah right and that was tiped by Mariam and and Moses right dancing after Israel came to the Red Sea there's no more evidence all those task Masters all my history's been erased Hallelujah by the blood of Jesus Christ it's been abolished I was severed in other words I was severed the the water separated but then the water came down and now I'm separated from my Egyptian life I'm separated from my worldly life I'm walking on to canaan's land I'm walking to the place where I possess all the promises where I possess my land not everybody's land but the land God gave to you and I praise God Amen Hallelujah so that old life Saints is destroyed no more records brother bam said you had old book of sin remember he said that he said but then Jesus when you got saved he said Jesus took his blood and wrote pardon and then he threw your old book in the sea of forgetfulness I didn't plan to preach this but I think I forget how many uh miles the the the ocean is deep I think it was almost six miles or something like that and church you know they still can't get down to the bottom without things exploded remember that happened earlier this year they tried to go down and see the Titanic and exploded they still can't get down the bottom of this thing now what does that show that Satan can't get down to the bottom of our sins right he can't bring them up that's right they're buried in the sea of forgiv praise God hallelujah God did it on purpose to show that's how deep nobody can go that deep only God can go that deep and he forgot it Hallelujah that's what it represents I'm forgetting that no one can touch it that's been abolished it's been seed away from you no more records hallelujah amen this is the gopel this is deep preaching Hallelujah Glory remember this the word destroy struck me he that commits sin is of the devil for the devil sins from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil so see so Jesus manifested your life to loose you from your addictions to loose you from your change to unbind you from whatever was binding you to release you from the power of darkness and now you're under the power of God's light amen that's what it means Satan's Works have been destroyed in my life now I'm loose Now I'm Free Like Jesus told that woman woman th are loosed amen you are free Hallelujah you're not bound to your past you're not bound to those sins anymore you're free can I say bride of Christ you are loose hallelujah amen the Church of Jesus Christ is Loos from the past Jesus destroyed the works of the devil praise God Amen because whosoever is born of God they can't s in their soul his seed remains in him and he cannot sin because he's born of God I cannot one part of me cannot sin hallelujah praise God one part of me can Another Part Of Me can't hallelujah thank God now I thought it was just beautiful brother Ram uh I looked up there's one time in the whole message where brother Ram said uh shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound God forbid it's in 1959 so here he reads Romans 61 through 5 and he's baptizing in his home church and he said I want to take a text about 20 minutes I don't know if it was I don't know if it's was 20 minutes or not it's probably longer than 20 minutes kind like when I said give me 15 more minutes right I preach a half hour his title was identify with Christ now identify means to regard as having strong links with so if you're identified with Christ I've got a strong link to him or it means I'm regarding myself as having the same characteristics as Christ I'm identified with him I'm a associated with him I have a strong link to Jesus now church this was a very uh common theme brother R Used being identified with Christ there's at least 10 sermons with the word identify in it Christ is identified the same in all generations how many think that's important word 10 sermons five definite identifications of the Church of the Living God God identifying himself by his characteristics God is identified by his characteristics ident ification identifi identification of Christ in all ages again again identified Masterpiece of God and identified with Christ hallelujah amen brother is trying to make a point you are strongly linked to Jesus amen that's why you walk through the snow brother to get to church when you're younger Hallelujah that's why Austin tried to go to church and they gave him candy remember your testimony brother they gave you candy say a prayer I'll give you some candy that's not that's not the real formula but he had a desire to serve God hallelujah see you want you want a strong link between you and Jesus Hallelujah yes that that means I'm identified with Christ well baptism is what does that brother said people have no satisfaction today he says because they've got a nature God gave them that nature they've got a nature that makes them want to have something to identify themselves with so each and every one of us we want a strong link to something used to be I wanted a link to Michael Jordan or you know the NFL I wanted a link to that I really want to do that but now I don't care about that I want to link to Christ yes I want to be in contact with him now look my says they must have something they like to be like an objective in life they want to be a movie star see they want to be linked to that movie or a cowboy or something like cowboys were famous in those days what's today today is a Marvel Superheroes that's what I want to be linked to Batman or I want to be linked to Superman well I am linked to the original Superman Hallelujah the Lord Jesus Christ amen he's the original Superman Hallelujah the only Superman see everybody wants to be identified with something and we got to be careful not to become identified with anything other than Christ right that's what we got to have our strong link to God made a man to desire to have an example so other words when you're identified with something you you use that as your example to pattern your life after amen that example of Jesus Christ now listen if we be more like him the wouldn't be so many big shots in the world there wouldn't be any hungry children in the world think of that there wouldn't be any Whiskey Drinking gambling and I'm I'm glad to say we don't have any of this in our church is there any big shots in here anybody want to try to take over for me and preach today any want to be a big shot or any big shots well Malachi you move let me play Malachi come on who's trying to be the big shot around here see you're just finding your place and you're being happy in your position in Christ we don't we don't have these problems because we put Christ first he's he's our identification Hallelujah that's what's the matter with the world they got the desire God give them that but they turn it around the wrong way it's time to return back get on the right Road get facing Calvary nature proves it Hallelujah and think about you know I heard brother you know preaching a sermon yesterday I can't remember which one it was now brother said look he said the men are cutting I'm sorry the men are letting their hair grow he said they want to be women he said women are cutting their hair they want to be men and look where we are these 60 years later right that was the seed form of what it is today it's almost like his preaching was for this day you know that was people thought oh there's nothing wrong with the woman cutting her hair now look what she wants to be she wants to be a man right like I saw I was just flipping through some videos and there's this there's this Entertainer she's a woman she calls herself the man that's her nickname is the man she wants to be that's her nickname She's the Man and it starts with this this little thing this little breaking of God's word right leaving your order right it's woman man Christ God like I Shar that with the church last week and they went whoa I never thought about that scripture before because there's an order and we got to stay in our order praise God Amen but they try to exalt themselves to a different position let's stay right where God made us that's where we'll be the happiest that's where we'll be identified with Christ amen he said if only people would look to Christ as their example he said we would we could fire now he means lay off right lay off every police officer out there be in the nation everybody would be meek and humble every would be kind and have brotherly love one for another there would never to be a divorce case ever pled in our country there would never be any sickness we could dismiss hospitals if everybody tried to make Jesus Christ their example we wouldn't have need for nothing else so I like this just this thought of identification this is what he's preaching to people that are going to be baptized he said share in his meekness you also share in his power share in his obedience you also share in his resurrection do as God says do in my heart the greatest thing I could think of is to be like Jesus Christ to be identified with him brother Jose we're reading through that book he got me the generations book and we're probably maybe five or six testimonies in and every person says there's nobody like brother Brandon he was just so humble he was so much like Jesus now some of them worship him but that's a sin uh they got caught up in the deity spirit but in every case they said we just never met such a loving humble person right he'd always make you feel like you're the big guy he always make you feel like you're the special one it's amazing they said they would they would see brother and priest to 10,000 people but then after that he'd go to the Little House of hady Wright and spend time with Hatty Wright and Edith Wright who was in a wheelchair and everybody wanted to shake hands them at the meeting but then he would come down he' go squirrel Hun he has squirrel blood all over his shirt and he would talk with a with a simple humble people the widows the crippled so let's remember no matter what great meetings or no matter what great events we go to let's remember to constantly descend to people of lower estate let's be humble and clearly we can see that brother R wanted to be like Jesus Christ he said that's why I baptize in the name of Jesus Jesus Christ because he's our identification we pack the identification whatsoever you do in word or deed do it all in the name of Jesus Christ giving praise to God for it and we are identified with him in baptism he said tonight we're going to baptize in a few minutes people here in the room that's here to be baptized if there's any desire in your heart that you want to have a great worldly Ambitions repent of them right now tell God you're sorry that you wanted to be some great worldly person say Lord my complete ambition is to be like Christ if only we can say that today come meekly humbly and when you put your hands upon his head he's now referring to the Old Testament tradition of putting the priest putting his hands on the animal Sacrifice by faith confess your sins say Lord I'm sorry I done it then what what will happen if you do that today church God will transfer all your guilt over to him and take his innocence and put it back on you and you stand justified in the presence of God because you believed on Jesus Christ his son What A Plan of Salvation then you'll share in his glory the goodness of God will come in see really really if you just say God I'm sorry and you really mean it something has to happen hallelujah amen all that guilt has to leave if you say I'm sorry the guilt has if you really meant it it has to leave and God's goodness will flow into you you can't help it it has to happen it's that cleaning out of the house if you clean out the house God's spirit is going to fill it up praise Goden Matthew chap 12 remember that the power of his resurrection will make you a new person it'll satisfy every longing you won't long for those worldly things you won't long for that kind of life you long for the life that Christ wants for you all right now back to Romans 6 okay only preach 45 minutes 47 47 for he that is dead is free from sin or Justified from sin so you're free your past is gone you're free from that now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him isn't that something we're dead and alive brother Austin at the same time how does that work M I'm dead and alive at the same time my goodness I'm a dead man but I'm a living man praise God we got to be dead with Christ in other words You' crucified the desires Amen to live a sinful life well if I'm dead with Christ I will live with Christ knowing that Christ being raised from the dead he dies no more amen death ha no more dominion over him praise God for in that he died he died once to sin but in that he lived he liveth unto God likewise reckon well that means count count you also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord remember brother gave the illustration the quote was coming to me again he said brother said uh he said you got to picture your life as like your old life is is like a dead body in a casket brother said if that dead body jumps up and says I'm alive he said you got to go push it down right you got to remember no you're dead right right right when your flesh wants something or you want to get angry and tell somebody up or you want to criticize or get depressed or fall into that you you got to push that guy down or that gal down and say no you're dead I'm alive Hallelujah that's what the B that's dying daily count Yourself Dead to sin I'm not alive to this anymore I'm dead to this through Christ my Lord hallelujah and he says let not sin therefore reain in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lust thereof now rain this is getting back we the last time I preached uh Part 12 I ended with this how we're Kings and Priests and God very familiar to us but again it's very familiar to the scripture so we must constantly remind ourselves of this let not sin re in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lust thereof so remember there's a difference between being tempted and actually obeying it temptation is what we have to go through right but we we got to overcome it we got to we got to uh we got to crucify it Hallelujah and then not let it rain in our body we can't let sin have exercise kingly power over us we can't let sin have the highest influence on our day we can't let our sins ruin our day for Christ right we can't let sin ruin our weak the church said Hallelujah can't let it happen yeah we all struggle we all have different battles every now and then but let's see more victories in who who wants more victories in our lives amen amen this is good a reminder if you're dead with him you're raised with him as well amen and you've got power over that sin and he says do not obey it don't let it be the most influence in your life praise God so we got to ask ourselves what's our greatest influence what are we in other words each day what are we most excited about what are we most looking forward to the Bible said don't make any provision for the flesh right don't plan out any times where we can sin or or try to do that or or try to get the pleasures of life or anything like that don't plan for that the Bible said Reign Over it ah Hallelujah the Bible said you exercise control over it praise God amen amen don't plan it out the Bible says don't let it re in your mortal body that you should obey the lust thereof neither yield yourselves members as instruments unto God I thought it was interesting Paul gives two don'ts usually we like to hear what what to do usually we like positive things like like at school they have this new positive behavior system they started few years ago and we're not we're not allowed to say uh don't kick we can't say don't we have to say uh keep your hands to yourself please now I still sometimes say don't because they say there's no power in negative words well there is sometimes Thou shalt not Jesus said right right the Bible says Thou shalt notal amen th shalt not kill but it's just it's just man's psychology right they're trying to control sin but you can't control outside of repentance right right but Paul says don't let sin re in your body in other words let righteousness re in your life and then he says don't yield to sin in other words yield to God so I'll give you the negative and I give you so I give you the negative over here don't I give you the positive over here amen whichever one helps you use that one don't let sin rain don't yield to sin or let righteousness Reign yield to God today praise Goden yield yourselves to God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God hallelujah so see these two instructions are sticking out to us we can't we can't let sin control Our Lives can't let sin ruin our days ruin our weeks ruin our months and we can't yield to it we have to yield to God now getting back to that day on coward this was such a beautiful section of quot Jesus broke the powers of Satan he opened the prison doors of Hell to every man that was shut up in this earth in the prisons fearing that he had died what death would be able to do on him Calvary he opened those cell doors that every captive Go free you don't have to be no longer be torn down by sin you don't have to no longer use your members to sin drinking smoking gambling telling lies you can be honest just and upright and Satan can do nothing about it amen because Jesus I always use this door CU it's close door Jesus opened the door and you can walk out of your problems you can walk out of your sin you can walk out of he can't Satan can't hold you out well Jesse's not getting out of there or Mai is not getting out of there he can't hold you in Jesus opened the door praise God hallelujah this is how brother Ram explains the power of Calvary amen amen amen it settles the sin question right all the sins are forgiven and now Satan has no power on us because we've got the word of God hallelujah that's why the Bible said he that the son is set free is what free indeed truly free amen you don't we don't have to be slaves we can be Overcomers amen if you like deep preaching praise God Amen Hallelujah you got a hold of the lifeline he says it's anchored in the Rock of Ages Lifeline Hallelujah holding on to Christ nothing can shake you from the lifeline no winds can shake you from it no nothing not even death itself can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus amen that's the story brother random gave remember brother RAM for his anniversary he went hunting on his anniversary now how many sisters would like that for your husband's taking on an anniversary trip we'll go off and we'll go get away in the woods but I'm going leave you here so I can go hunt and be gone all morning into the afternoon how many now sister don't have to raise your hands something tells me I don't think my wife would like that very much if I said if I said I like to go hunting on an anniversary well that's what brother did and while he's out there a snowstorm came in I'm just going to paraphrase this story and he thought well I'm a Woodsman I know my way back and he said I walked in a circle he said the Indian Death March remember that and he kept doing it kept doing it until he finally broke down in Repentance and he said God I'm not a he said I'm not a God I I don't know the woods I can't make it home on my own and he said that's when he lifted up his hands to praise God and then his hand hit the electric line and that electric line would guide him back to his cabin with his wife he was going to die and that's what he's saying here Satan can do nothing because you got a hold of the lifeline you might be like you're lost some days you might go through weeks of difficult time but as soon as you get a hold of the lifeline Satan has no more power youve got to way back Hallelujah am and that's what he was telling God God now my wife's going to got no electric or she's got no food there the baby's going to die I I got to have you Lord I'm reaching out to you I'm praising you and then his hand hit the line and he's got a Lifeline he said now my wife won't freeze to death now I I won't freeze to death but it took repentance he had to Humble himself and say I I'm not the big guy I'm not the boss I I I need God's grace I need God's mercy every hour praise God amen amen not even death itself can separate us from the love of God where's that from Romans chapter 8 Hallelujah my beautiful that's what Calvary meant men that were in bondage were set free men that were once under fear of death can no longer fear death a man who Longs for a city whose Builder maker is God he can step on the highway and set his face toward Heaven because he's free amen that's what brother says in the sermon brother said Abraham wandered around looking for a city but now brother says because of Christ now we know where we're walking we're spiritually walking to that New Jerusalem amen he didn't know where he was walking right remember he died not receiving the promise he died with only of few descendants but God said your descendants will be like the stars in heaven he died not seeing the end of the promise but God always keeps his promis amen God if God has promised us anything we shall have it praise God we may not see it on this side but God will definitely give it to us cuz God is not a liar like a man amen he keeps his word hallelujah but he asked us to be patient in the midst of Trials Hallelujah he asked us to trust his way not our way you don't need to wonder no more for there's a way of knowing whether you're right or not Hallelujah God gives us life our sins are gone that day at Calvary paid the price when we see all that no wonder the poem wrote mid rendering rocks and darkening Skies My Savior bowed his head and died the opening Veil revealed the way to Heaven's Joys and endless day prise God hallelujah reminds me of Haven hav wrote me a poem for my birthday and it was such a rhyming poem I'm like how do you write that haven you've got a gift of God there's something in there that writes all these lyrics it's inspiration it's the Holy Spirit Abraham don't have to wonder no more across the country seeking the city The Sinner don't have to wonder anymore whether he be saved or not the sick man don't have to wonder whether he can be healed or not the opening Veil on that day of calvary revealed the way to the total Victory amen God give us the powers of his Spirit to live triumphantly over all these things ask us to only believe it that happened on that day at Calvary amen never day was never there was a day like it never there will be one like it it's not necessary no more the price is paid we're redeemed amen there's no way you have to wonder about there's no more guessing about it he took it all out of the way what what what he took he took what out of the way all the sin questions am I going to go to hell has God forgiv me that's all taken away the powers of Satan can Satan have power over me no Jesus broke the power all the questions settled praise God no more guessing the veil pull back the curtain and we're set on a highway not to wonder anymore but to believe and just walk right on we walk right into God's very presence amen because the veil has been torn almost done here for sin shall not have dominion over you for you are not under the law but under grace What then shall we sin because we're not under the law but under grace God forbid so twice in this chapter Paul says God forbid God forbid that we should keep sinning so Grace gets greater and then he said uh God forbid we should uh sin because we're not under law we're under grace now God forbid in other words God wants us to appreciate what the cross did for us amen God wants us to appreciate the fact that he wrote pardon with his blood upon our old list of sins and through it in the sea of forgetfulness like that song says i'm want to live like I'm forgiven I'm going to live like my sins are forgiven how's that song say he's worthy my song remember that song from Brother Phil I'm GNA live like I'm forgiven I can't ever remember the exact words anybody remember the exact I'm going to live like my king is risen I know that hard but that's how I want to live we want to live like we're forgiven people amen hallelujah I'm under grace I'm not under the law and he says don't you know don't you know that whom you use your memb servants to obey his servants you are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of un obedience unto righteousness see this this would help any church member right Jewish virgin or wise virgin this so shows you who you're serving whoever you yield to on a constant basis that's whose God that's the god you serve whether Christ or Satan but God be thanks so in other words God deserves some things for this right here church that you were the Servants of sin but now you've obeyed from the heart the form of doctrine that was delivered to you so you ought to give some God some thanks if you've obeyed the doctrine amen hallelujah amen maybe we can do that since it's Thanksgiving right Hallelujah we should do that every day like amen saying thank you Lord for Calvary last week right there's an hour so I don't have to go much longer I don't have to being made free from sin you became the Servants of righteousness Hallelujah so this is what we should be thankful for that we've obeyed the word of God Christ has set us free our sin debts paid for Satan has no more power of us and now we can do the works of Christ we can do the works of Christ I'm going to finish Romans 6 I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of Flesh for as you have yielded to set at hand to stand by or near your memb servants to unclean and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your memb servants to righteousness unto Holiness now see what the word yield means it means to just wait at attention wait for orders is what it means when you're yielding to God I'll say like this you're waiting each day Lord what do you want me to do Lord what should I do today instead of planning out sin so this ought encourage you if you're serving God this ID encourage you you're setting yourself aside to serve God you're not making time to go sin all day the church said amen you're not working all day like some of my friends just so you can go get drunk at at the bar at night time what a waste of a day or they work all week they work all week to go on Friday night to get wasted that's what they live for they're planning it out but I'm working all week so I get to church on Sunday praise God I can see the Saints I can worship God I can hear the word of the Lord I can be refreshed hallelujah amen that's what I'm working for all week living for the weekend like they say that's true living for Saturday I get some time with the Lord get some errand done Sunday worship with God's people amen amen I'm standing here Lord I'm here I'm here at my poster Duty however however you want to use me Lord I'm right here someone needs prayer someone needs teaching someone needs counseling I'm right here someone needs help financially I'm right here praise God someone needs some wisdom someone needs some dire someone needs a scripture Bible study I'm right here I'm right in my post of Duty Lord I'm yielding myself to the Holy Spirit how many want to yield to the Holy Spirit now for as parents let's be there as parents let's be there I'm ready to help my children right that's what I want or grandchildren right brother Jose or yeah I'm Lord I'm muted I'm here I'm sitting here I'm standing beside waiting you Lord for you to give me the words for my grandchildren my children or my co-workers or my class okay I'm right here I'm just waiting for my orders praise God brother says you get orders what do you got to do you got to pack them out how many want to pack out the orders from heaven today Hallelujah I'm almost done even so now yield your members so stand beside Christ waiting for orders unto Holiness for when you were the Servants of sin you were free from righteousness see you had no righteousness while you were a sinner what fruit had ye then in those things whereof you're now ashamed for the end of those things is death what good came out of all my sports worship what good came out of all those movies I wasted all that money on I had a whole brother Austin I had a whole I had a whole shelf of all these movies I bought what a waste of money what fruit isn't any of that there's no fruit in that but now I can put the money in and now I can have all the books of the Bible L now I can have brother sermons lined up Hallelujah you got fruit the end of all sin is death or separation from God but now you're made free from sin you became Servants of God have your fruit unto Holiness and the end everlasting life for the wages of sin is death see that's what we deserve that's what that's what we deserve a paycheck for right our paycheck we deserve is death right that's what we that's what we've earned we we've worked for it through our sins but instead of that God gives us the gift of God which is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord amen Jesus took our sin that for us so that we can have eternal life amen so let us not let sin reain in our bodies amen and let us yield to God I'm closing with this thought the power of one so getting back to uh getting back to Romans 8 I'm sorry 5:18 the Bible said one man's sin cus one man's Disobedience C everyone to sin but one man's righteousness made many righteous I found this sermon here I'm going to just read a few portions do you ever hear of the parable of the nail one day there was a nail there was a nail on the church building kind of like they're replacing that that roof over there you see how they were replacing the roof over there you see those guys work they were there they were there working yesterday they took it off they're putting it on one of those Nails said oh they won't miss me they don't need me nobody likes me after all this is a big beautiful building it has stained glass windows plush carpet painted walls a beautiful pulpit and chandeliers I'm just a little nail holding down a sing a shingle on the roof I'm not important anybody ever felt that way before I'm just nobody in the church all they need is brother Jesse all they need is brother amen I nobody they they could have service without me don't ever think that we can't have service without you we're a really small church so it's almost true literally he says so the nail worked itself loose and fell to the ground it began to rain and the nail was buried in the mud and began to rust the shingle loosened and Rain began to leak into the beautiful building the rain the water stained the pews Pulpit walls and carpet all because the nail felt it was not important so here we see the importance of one nail somewhere in our house my wife could tell you we got a leak of water somewhere and because we got one leak in in our house our wood floors in our kitchen is now it's unstable right because of one leak right the power of one leak right now this is the negative right the power of one leak how many ever how many ever had just one problem but it led to so many other problems ever had that before the only one one thing can make a huge difference did you know this I look this up on this gentleman's sermon California Oregon and Washington all became States because of one vote think about that who's ever enjoyed going to California you've been to California I've been there too one vote made the difference because so one person's vote now look look at it today look how valuable the land is today because of one person one person made a difference now here's the sad part but one woman meline Murray O'Hare was responsible for the 1963 Supreme Court decision to ban prayer in public schools one woman and no no no no wonder Church brother R said women uh he warned about women getting the right to vote and not Holy Ghost for women but most women are sinners right and look what these women these s Sinners these sinful women have done right that's who that's who the left and the The Crazy Ones go after all the time they they work on their emotions of the women now there's just as many evil men as well but I'm just saying look at that and people will bash brother Brandon because he was against giving women the right to vote but look at the wisdom look at the foresight of God right right that they brought all this in prayer out and you know also the Supreme Court decision roie Wade was a woman over 60 million abortions because of one woman right and of course all the corrup judges on there but it was brought by this one woman remember uh of course Eve Adam Adam and Eve one Disobedience aen one man sin brought death to 30 Israelis you can hardly emphasize the power of one but let's look at the good side it's estimated there was 25 million people in the days of Noah but one man found Grace in the sight of the Lord praise God The Power of One Man Hallelujah and now we can all Trace our natural DNA back there and also our spiritual DNA Hallelujah believing God trusting in God for Grace Saving Grace Hallelujah because of one man Hallelujah yeah the estimate 25 million people through Abraham one man every nation is blessed because of one man decided I will leave my my parents I'll leave my my idols and I'll go follow the the voice of God amen glory I'll forsake all my family and I'll follow this voice this holy voice that I hear amen because of One Man United States is blessed Hallelujah right because one man Abraham and that's true for every single nation under Earth I wish I could get off the globe every single nation is blessed because one man decided to believe God despite all his frustrations despite he was 75 years old and had no children and hadn't seen God move yet despite all that because of his simple Faith God's blessed all of us praise God Amen the power of one man said he can just get one man he said or woman in his hand God can do amazing things Hallelujah all nations are blessed because of one man one man Moses brought out two million people out of Egypt one man but who saved that man Zora Hallelujah one woman saved that man as well see she played a great part in there Jonah had the greatest Revival ever according the Bible 250,000 people saved in Nineveh because of one man now God had to spank him to get him there sometimes God's got to spank us to get us places but God's will is going to be done hallelujah you can run from God's call for your life you can run run run but God's going to get you in the right place if you're a child of God you're eventually going to say Lord I Surrender I'm nothing special I I can't guide my life I need you to guide my life Hallelujah one man used by God hallelujah now the reason I brought this in because brother or brother cam sorry brother cam preach those sermons one of you will chase a thousand yes five of you will chase 10,000 right and this struck me wow the power of one Adam produced all this death Adam and Eve produced all this death but Christ produced all this righteousness The Power of One Man hallelujah how many of you there's power in one man so there's the scripture remember these scriptures show when Israel came out of I'm Sor when they got ready to cross over there was 6001 1,730 fighting men that Joshua was able to take in the promised land so they calculate over 2.5 million people were with Joshua and chur think about this on the day of atonement all their sins were placed upon those two goats one was killed the scapegoat was sent away and on that day all the sins of two and a half million people were forgiven in one day amen Hallelujah I tried to figure it out on the calculator it wouldn't even I didn't have enough room for the zeros on how many sins that would be there's not enough room on there and God did that as the Old Testament type of what Jesus Christ would do for us praise God that's a type the power of of of those of those goats the scapegoat the power of the scapegoat and here the power of Christ becoming our sin for us that we might be forgiven so don't think J God's going to hold your sin against you he can't it's already it's already paid for praise God if you confess it he's right there to comfort you amen and say my father will forgive you my father loves you hallelujah amen you're God's beloved remember that so think about that all those millions of sins all those I mean as billions of billions of sins of all those people all of it could be wiped out one day by the pure sacrifice amen there's five of you will chase 100 100 you should put 10,000 to flight now here here now this is just encouraging for us I'm trying to close here I'm probably get an hour and a half here Moses is writing about Israel he said they are a nation void of counsel neither is there any understanding in them oh that they were wise that they understood this that they would consider this their latter end how should one Chase a thousand and put 10,000 to fly except their Rock had sold them and the Lord had shut them up in other words Israel for God the only reason I have Supernatural power the only reason there're Supernatural working here is because God has done it for us see they lost all their pride this wasn't my power that did this this was God's power brother C was preaching one of you can chase a thousand now how many want that power praise God we want it and we got to remember it's always God's power it's not our power that's what we see in Romans 6 Romans 5 it's through one man one man chased a a million one man traced a trillion Hallelujah Jesus took all of our sins away for their rock is not as our Rock even our enemies themselves being judges and then I'm going to close with this here last scripture let him know that he which converteth The Sinner from the air of his way shall save soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sins to me church this is the New Testament equivalent for the Old Testament type of one's Warrior can kill a thousand like Samson this is the New Testament if you point one person to Christ it's as if you drove away multitudes of sins one of you can chase away a multitude of sins by pointing someone to Christ amen hallelujah fighting a natural battle right now we have to get out our guns and our ARS it's a legal right but that's not what God is talking about God's asking can we convert someone and can we show them the gospel that the gospel will show them that all their sins are scattered away all their sins are sent away to me this is the equivalent that we can have Hallelujah of one person can chase away a multitude of sin how many believe that's possible today amen amen let's s our feet musicians can come here I wanted to read this to the power of one Dr Seuss was of course a children's author I always have children's books in my room so I remember this quote he wrote to the world you may be one person but to one person you may be the world I like that thought you know in our eyes who am I I'm just one little pastor this whole world that's true you might be one little person but to one person you might be their entire world you might be the reason they get saved you might be the reason they serve Christ because of you so I want to show I want to end with that the power one if Jesus had the power of one in his life and we've got the spirit of Jesus guess what you can have the power in your life as well you have a great influence in your life as long as you're identify with Christ how many identified with Christ well Jesse you're quoting Dr Seuss well that really came from the Bible because in SEC 2 Samuel 18 they said David you won't go fight for us because you're worth 10,000 of us right in other words you're worth the world to us we can't lose you that's how we should feel towards Christ amen but there's going to be people in your life and some of you already have them that because of you because of your prayers because of your life you've helped lead them to Christ and you've converted somebody from a multitude of sin like for me it's like brother cam brother Cy who got me listening to Jesus who showed me the message is there any way I can pay them back there's no way I can pay them back Hallelujah think about someone who's made an impact in your life there's power in one person that impacted you now may God help us to be the one person that we can mean the world to how many want to be that person to somebody I want to be that person to somebody let's have a word of Prayer father we thank you for today Lord we can see in your scripture the power of one person we can see the negative aspect of it with abortion and prayer Adam and Eve but Lord we can also see the positive part of it too with Christ I love what the Bible says he died not for our sins but for the sins of the entire world one man The Power of One sacrifice Lord I Thank you for the word of God that that we heard today may we not let sin reign in our mortal body may we not yield our members to sin Grant it Lord Jesus Hallelujah Lord God and Lord I pray Lord you use me use the people here that they can convert a sinner from the air of his way and it will chase away a multitude of sin Lord that scrip struck me ever since cam preached it Lord how can I chase away a thousand that's how I can do it I can point someone to Christ I can point my children to Christ I can point the children at bible Club to Christ to get saved Hallelujah Lord May each person sense a burden on their hearts for someone they can pray for for salvation dear God to chase a thousand away th sins of guilt and shame Hallelujah Lord I'm reminded that brother from Iowa
