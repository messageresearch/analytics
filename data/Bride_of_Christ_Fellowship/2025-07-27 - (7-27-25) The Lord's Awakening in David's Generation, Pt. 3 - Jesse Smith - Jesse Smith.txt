========================================

You guys should have seen Nia. He looks so handsome yesterday. I said he's got this black shirt on and black tie. I'm like, that's the most handsome I've ever seen, that guy. So, you looking good, brother. Hallelujah. So, I just so appreciate everybody by God's grace. So So, we want to read uh 65 and 66. Put those up there together. Thanks again, brother Vang, for doing that, brother. We'll read both of those together. It's only two verses. Okay, let's start on three. 1 2 3. Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shoutth by reason of wine, and he smoked his enemies in their hinder parts, he put them to a perpetual reproach. Let's have one more word of prayer. If you have a need on your heart, let's make it known unto God. We know the word of God is how faith comes into our life. I'm sure we all want more faith today. Hallelujah. Lord, increase our faith or as brother Diggs preached to us, unlock our faith. Father God, we're thankful for today, Lord God. We know, Lord, there's a there's a a spiritual element to it and a predestinated element. Lord, the Bible says add to your faith virtue and knowledge and all these things. And Lord, there's also the uh spiritual element of it where uh the seed of God that's in us has all the potentials already, Lord God. So, Father, we pray just add to our faith today, Lord God. I have my plans, what I felt led of the Holy Spirit to bring out while I was preparing, but Lord, you're free to take your servant, Lord God. Help me just to serve your purpose. And Lord, just go as the people pull, Lord. Whatever they have need of today, God, help me not to uh sway, Lord God, but help me to be faithful to your commands. Bless your people today, God. They've come out to the house, Lord. Everybody looks so happy and healthy. It was such a beautiful day, Lord God. I pray just let your spirit have preeminence today. Bless your people today, Lord God. Thank you for the reality of thus sayith the Lord. Thus sayith the scripture in our lives. Thank you for this fellowship, Lord. Protect us, strengthen us, Lord God. Help us to uh Lord have our way filled every day with love, the love of Jesus Christ. Charity, it's the capstone for the believer, the stature, the fullness of Jesus Christ in our lives. God grant it today. Bless his preaching of thy word in Jesus Christ's name. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." God bless you as you're being seated. Praise God. Hallelujah. So, let's um I'm going to set a timer here just to see how far I can go. Now, the last few Sundays, Brother uh Austin and Brother Chris and I have had Sunday night Bible studies. So, if you'd like to be a part of that, let me know. I I can do a Google meet. I can send out a link if people want to be a part of that by God's grace. It's got to end before 8 o'clock because that's the time about Malachi's got to go to bed. So, uh we normally do it about 6:30, 6:45 or 7 to 8 or something like that. So, um, we want our mothers, you know, with the babies, we want them to have enough time to rest and recover before, uh, they fully devote themselves to devote a whole day at church. That's a long time. And, um, so we want to give them full time, uh, to adjust with the family here by God's grace. Hallelujah. So, let's look at this thought here, part three, the Lord's awakening in David Generation. I hope you enjoyed Wednesday night. That was to me that was a really special, beautiful message from the word of God. We showed uh through all the New Testament verses that someone is sleeping when they're committing sexual fornication and engaging in lust lustful cravings, taking advantage of brothers and sisters for their own gain. They're into other people's business like maybe a gossip or something. They're lazy. They're dishonest. They're rioting which is late night parties. Chambering, which is sleeping from house to house. Strife or division in the church. envying others, wanting to be like others, wantingness. Is that say that right? Wantedness. Wantedness. There it is. Wantedness. Okay, which is uh lentiousness. In other words, again, cravings of the the flesh. Filthy words. If people are saying filthy words or coarse jesting or jokes that shouldn't be told, that's someone who's sleeping on God. And luxuries, uh buying things that you don't need with money you don't have. Hallelujah. Covetous. Uh wanting things other people have. And then any idol in someone's life that's sleeping. Hallelujah. Now, if you don't have any of those, hallelujah, you're wide awake today. Hallelujah. Amen. That's a blessing. And we also we ended with by by showing Saul only one time did he approach the ark of the covenant. Think about that. One time he had access his whole life to talk to God. Think of that. He had access to talk to God as much as he wanted. And he only did it one time and it was only halfway because as the noise got louder, he said, "Withhold your hand, priest." He said, "I'm going out to battle." Now he got the victory. But think about that. Of all the times he could have got thus sayith the Lord, he only did it half a time. So church, I think my wife was even sharing with me one time recently, you know, uh we look at we look at Israel, they had a pillar of fire and all these things, right? I think we were talking about that one time. And we we we would envy them, right? We would say, "My, they had God every time." But we've got actually more than that. We've got the word of God, &gt;&gt; right? There's more Bible verses, right? God can talk to us more through here than just uh we say a manifestation of God leading us by a fire. &gt;&gt; Does everybody understand that? By God's grace, in other words, yeah, that fire will lead us physically, but this will lead us spiritually. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; And we have I I feel like we're more advantage. How many believe that we have better promises, a better covenant? Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. because we can get thus sayith the Lord all the time. &gt;&gt; I think it was Claude who was texting me questions, right? We're texting about Adam and Eve, right? Was that you, brother? I thought so. I didn't know if it was Patrick. I couldn't remember. But I love it. You know, when the when the saints have questions, look to the scripture. The scripture will give us thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; We're such a privileged people. Now, I would I would appreciate a pillar of fire that if it was here would lead us, you know, to go to that house or go I would appreciate that. But we also have so much more. But if I didn't have the word of God, I'd feel I'd feel like a little deprived. Wouldn't you? &gt;&gt; But to know we have thus sayith the Lord. We can go look every time we need something and find a truth in the word of God. No wonder we sing that song, come and dine. The master calleth, you can feast at Jesus table anytime. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So friends, let's be awake today. Hallelujah. Not just physically, but spiritually. And if we have sin in our lives, we must only confess them. Now, I want to bring this out just briefly. It's it's a little bit of a a background on Psalm 78:65. Uh notice in verse uh 66 though, he smoked their enemies in their hinder parts. So when God started waking up, he started putting diseases on people's hinder parts, their backside. That was in the book of uh Samuel, right? 1st Samuel 5:6. But the hand of the Lord was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smokeote them with emeralds, even Ashdod, and the coast thereof. 1st Samuel 5:9, he smoked the men of the city, both small and great, and they had in their secret parts. So when God started rising up, he physically smoked the Philistines in their back parts. Hallelujah. Amen. Now church, look what God's done with this homosexual community. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All the diseases, all the STDs, God has smoked them. &gt;&gt; Right? What does it but that what does that mean? That's just one sign to us that God has risen up and he's awakened our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's he's driven all that nonsense. Right? None of that's ever come into our church because God has risen up. He's defeated those foes and those enemies have been put under our feet. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as I told you, brother Mike Durle, he passed away a few years ago, but he was an open homosexual until someone handed him a card. We had used to have those cards out there where Brother Bram's picture was on it. And someone just handed him a card and it said, "God sent a prophet." He wrote a letter to Jeffersonville. They sent him books. He started reading and he left that community. Amen. &gt;&gt; What is God doing? God is raising people up. He's wakening people spiritually, raising them up so they can fight for the Lord. They can be on the winning team because the battle belongs to the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I mean, God is doing that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And this was part of what the scripture said. This was God wakening. He said, "Now I'm going to fight against my enemies." Hallelujah. Now I'm going to deliver my people, church. If you need to be delivered, God is here. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You don't have to remain defeated. You don't have to remain in a beaten position. You can be an overcomer. You can put any any enemy under your feet. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I would I would go as far as saying, I believe anything anybody's struggling in with here today, you could find somebody else in this church who has overcome it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you could talk to them and if you under the sweetness of the Holy Spirit and honesty and integrity and maybe with another witness, you could talk with them. How did you get the victory? And I believe if you were humble enough, you could find the way to get your victory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Like I was sharing with you, I'll just share it. Um well, I don't think I'll share this, but the a preacher came in recently and said, "I'm working my way up to fast in a whole week and he he was working on get up to seven days and he was seeing more victory in his life." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've said this before. Banks heard me say this. If you want a victory you've never had before, you've got to do something you've never done before. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that doesn't mean worldliness. You got to be more spiritual. &gt;&gt; Amen. But see, God has already given us the victory, the word. But each one of us have to find the channel how that victory is going to come through. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right, church. Hallelujah. Now, for me, remember my battle over sugar? I had to do a 21-day sugar fast. And that was the defeat, the temptation of the lust of the flesh. &gt;&gt; I had to do something I'd never done before to get a result I never had before. &gt;&gt; And so yesterday, Brother Mua tried to give me all these pops. I'm like, "No thanks, man." I said, "Let me show you the emeralds I got smoked with." Hallelujah. I appreciate everybody's kindness. But, uh, we see it there. You know, by God's grace, if we want a victory, God is going to find God is going to give us some truth in the word of God. We got to be willing to walk in that path. Why, church? And it's got to be important to you because when you get a testimony, you can help other people get a testimony. &gt;&gt; Think about that. When you're finally walking in victory over your enemies, you can be a witness to other people. Hey, if I did it, if God did it for me, God can do it to you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he's mighty in battle. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He smoked his enemies, the Philistines, and their hinder parts. And then he put them to a perpetual reproach. Hallelujah. They were shamed and reproached. The Bible says in 1st Samuel 5. Now, if you study the Philistines, eventually they run out and they're just they're they're kind of swallowed up by uh the Assyrians and the Babylons, and the Philistines are no more. Church, it's a good lesson for us. We might battle Philistines for years, but if we believe in God, if we put God's word to work, the Philistines will be no more in our lives. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It'll be the the the battle, the enemy will get swallowed up. The Bible said they'll get swallowed up in life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're able to get victories where we don't struggle with those things anymore. If we just take it to God, if we just believe God's word, if we just go further than we've gone before. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like I've told different ones, you know, uh try to fast till lunchtime and then try to fast till 3:00. Cornelius fasted till 3:00 and that's when he heard the thus sayith the Lord from Peter and the angel. Try to go to 3:00 or 6 p.m. or whatever you can. And if you need God to move in your life, you got to be willing to sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And as we'll see, we got to be willing to find thus sayeth the Lord as David did. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to see here, um, remember the Bible said, we will never be ashamed. We have, thus sayith the Lord, that the fullness of Pentecost will be in the bride. Now, in some ways, we're a far way off. Other ways, we're very close. &gt;&gt; We've got the right doctrine. We got the love of God. Hallelujah. We need more power. Hallelujah. But power comes with sincerity. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Ram said, Brother Ram makes it seem like the sincerity will come once the squeeze comes on &gt;&gt; when there's pressure. &gt;&gt; Because if you if you listen to the sermon, desperation, right after brother preached the token, he said, "It's a shame, but humans normally need God to bring them into desperation." &gt;&gt; And we're going to need desperation to go in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They needed desperation on the day of Pentecost, did they not? They had to wait up there 10 days. They were in fear of the Roman guards. It took desperation to get them ready. But church, God, help us to seek God. God, help us to have desperation for other victories in our life other than the rapture. We know it's going to come, but God, give us desperation to be ready to get victories in this time before the rapture. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's true. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Joel 2:23, "Be glad then, you children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God, for heath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause you to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month." The former rain was Brother Ram's ministry. We're waiting for the latter rain, and the floor should be full of wheat, and the fats overflow with wine and oil. And I'll restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, the caterpillar, the Palmerworm, my great army, which I set among you. So God is going to restore the book of Acts in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I was listening to a sermon I preached back in uh 2011 at CAM church and it was just everything I said it was shouting and screaming. That was a great time of revival for us. &gt;&gt; Everything I said shouting and screaming from 2011. Uh so I would say that was like some of the time from 2010, 11, 12, 13. So that was some of the greatest revival that we've seen temporarily. But the best part is God can restore it again. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said you can't withstand a revival past about three or four years. Three years. But that doesn't mean a revival can't come back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It can come back. Hallelujah. And another generation, the younger generation, the younger generation has to be willing, hungry for it. So does the older generation has to get out of our ways and then God can give us another revival. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a possibility. like Cam Preach here. Samson had to realize there's a possibility God can bring the power back again. Hallelujah. There's a possibility for revival. My hair's growing back. Samson said, "Hallelujah. There's a possibility God will restore. If I just die to myself, God will restore power." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Church, remember, these are all given by God. And let me just say like this. If we're not guilty of all those sins we listed on Wednesday, you know, uh, sexual sin, uh, all the grudges and idolatry, church, then we are awakened God and we're just waiting for God's timing for revival. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that everybody understand that? &gt;&gt; God will send a revival in his time. Now, we know we have to be yielded for it, but if we can look at our lives and say we don't have any of these works of sleepiness, spiritual sins in our lives, then God can give us revival &gt;&gt; and God will do it as his at his appointed time. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, where I want to get to is verse 26. And ye shall eat him plenty and be satisfied. And praise the name of the Lord your God, that I dealt wondrously with you, and my people shall never be ashamed. &gt;&gt; See, God made the Philistines ashamed. He put He put uh emrods in their back parts. He made them ashamed. But God is saying, "My people will never be ashamed. Amen. &gt;&gt; My people will be thankful for the word of God. We're not ashamed of the word. We're thankful for the word. &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed of this church or our beliefs. I'm thankful for them. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I built my life upon it. My ministry, my family, everything of me, I built my life upon the Bible, Revelations. I'm not ashamed of this message. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God won't let me be ashamed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because I just have to look at other people and that don't believe the message. look at their lives and that makes me sad for them, but it makes me thankful for the truth. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right, church. God's people will never, let's say, never, can we? &gt;&gt; Never &gt;&gt; be ashamed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You'll never be ashamed to be a real Holy Ghost fil believer. You'll never be ashamed of that. You'll be thankful for that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, remember Psalm 41:11. Psalm 41:11. Remember, this is how you know God's given you favor. By this I know that thou favors me because my enemy do not triumph over me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How do I know, brother Jesse? I'm getting the victory because God doesn't let fear overtake you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God doesn't let depression ruin your life. &gt;&gt; Or suicidal thoughts. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "God does not let that trial. Yes, I battle it. Yes, the birds fly over my barn all the time. But I always knock them out. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's how I know God is with me. God favors me. Because of my own self, I would have failed many times with lust of the eyes, lust of the flesh, pride of life. I would have failed many times, but they did not triumph over me. I'm still in the house of God. I'm still giving God praise. I'm still seeking God's face. They did not triumph over me because God's fighting for me. &gt;&gt; God favors me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Anyone else's favor doesn't really matter. But if you've got God's favor, you are more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you can face any enemy, no matter you whether you feel God or not. Jesus never said, "Did you feel it?" Jesus said, "If you can believe it." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All things are possible to them that believe. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Look at verse 12. And as for me, thou upholdest me. Now what? See this? We looked at integrity last week. What did God do? God upheld David in his integrity. What does uphold mean? I'm upholding the Bible. So God is the hand. God is the nail scarred hand holding up your integrity. &gt;&gt; In other words, God is your strength. God keeps you from sinning because you probably would have done it. &gt;&gt; Your flesh would have loved to do it because your flesh is enmity against the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; But God helps you keep your integrity. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God keeps you from giving into sin. God keeps your enemy from trying over over you. God holds up your innocence. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he setest me before thy face forever. Hallelujah. So God almost he holds up your integrity and you're set before his face forever. In other words, you're constantly in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; I know God's here. I know God's watching over me. Amen. &gt;&gt; I just like Austin and I were saying, we just can't stop thinking about God, which is God's on our thoughts wherever we go. No matter what we do, we always feel like we're being watched by God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's how it is. Amen. Whether we're struggling or victorious, we know God's right there. That's such a confirmation that you're a child of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the the the true believers, the Bible said they want God in all their thoughts. &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, Lord, help me not to forget you. Lord, bring you bring your word into every part of my day so I can see before your face. I can be in your presence and I can be an overcomer. I can see that you favor me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 13. Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now look, David's obedience, we'd say, or his love for God or his integrity or his fear of the Lord made it so much easier to defeat his enemies. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's remember this, friends. Selfishness is not your friend. &gt;&gt; It's your enemy. &gt;&gt; When you want to do something and you know it's against the word of God, or you want to do something and your husband or wife doesn't want to do it, and you know you're being selfish, you know just you want your way, that's your enemy. That's not your friend. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Easy living or laziness or tiredness, not giving God your best diligence, that is not your enemy. &gt;&gt; Laziness is not your friend. Hallelujah. Now, if you've overworked yourself and you've been going on three hours of sleep for a while, then yes, you need some rest. Hallelujah. Get you some rest, they'd say. Hallelujah. Or if you had a rough night or something like that. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about consistently not giving God time that he deserves in your life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's not your friend. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We'd say fear is not your friend. Fear is your enemy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lust is not your friend. Lust is your enemy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Money is not your friend. Money is a tool. How about that? Hallelujah. The Bible says that. Amen. It cannot be your God. You cannot love it. You must see it as a tool. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And see friends, these are enemies. The love of money is the root of all evil. Praise God. &gt;&gt; These must all be viewed as enemies and they must be conquered because God is for me, not against me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God is for you and God wants to strengthen you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Now, the main meat of my message, I think, is this. Let's look now if you got your Bible, let's look at David, some of David's victories. Uh, and he and many times he consulted the ark. Now, I could find at least at least nine times David mentioned the ark, honored the ark, or went to the ark for guidance. How many did Saul do? One. He actually went to the ark once. That's if you don't count the last one where he said, "I tried to go there, but I've got to go to a witch." Right? The ark wouldn't answer me. So, at least maybe once or twice he tried, but he failed because he ignored it. church. He neglected God for so many years. Oh. Oh, my friends. If we could just realize, Amen. No matter how many weeks we've wasted or months or years we've wasted. God said, we just read it. God will restore the years. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't waste your years. Don't waste your weeks. Don't waste your months. God will restore the months. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God will restore the weeks. If you wasted time, get back to God. Let God turn it around. God said, "I will." Not you will. God will. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. God redeems wasted days, weeks, months, years. God knows how to redeem it. &gt;&gt; He puts himself, he puts his spirit into our lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; 1st Samuel 23 2 3 and 4. Now, this is after David has ran from, he's been running from Saul for a while. 1st Samuel 23:2. Therefore, David inquired the Lord, saying, "Shall I go up and smite these Philistines?" And the Lord said to David, "Go and smite the Philistines and save Keela." Can you do verse three and four? And David's men said to him, "Behold, we are afraid here in Judah. How much more if we come to Keela against the armies." Now look at this. He gets thus say the Lord, but all of his friends in the message are a little afraid. &gt;&gt; Does God say, "I'm done with them?" No. God understands that we battle fear. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And this is even this is awesome too because go this this validates God will repeat his perfect will for you even when you're afraid. &gt;&gt; Do I know if it's the right move or not? Let me just go seek again. Let me just let me take another little moment. Let me go spend time with God in prayer. Let me make sure I've got the right leading. God will accept you in that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, it's okay to wonder. Well, did I hear it right the right time or the first time? Did I hear it right? Uh I want to make sure I know God's heart. Amen. And God will gladly receive you. If he received David, he'll receive you. &gt;&gt; Verse four. So now, well, here's the second time we know he went to the ark. And David inquired of the Lord yet again. And the Lord answered him and said, "Arise, go down to Kila, for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand." So he gets a double confirmation. The church said, &gt;&gt; "God always confirms with two or three witnesses. &gt;&gt; Should I go?" Everybody's afraid. Should I do this? Should I confront confront the brother? Confront the sister. Uh, let me ask God and follow God's will. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. Always follow God's first saying &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; now. Look, look, church. Look, God answered David the same way both times. God didn't do that with Balum. &gt;&gt; Why? Because God knew Balam wanted to go. &gt;&gt; That's why brother used that word neutral. You've got to be neutral. &gt;&gt; In other words, I'm not leaning one way or the other. I just I'm waiting on God. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, the first time Balam wanted to go, he didn't get the word. So Bale said, "Go, go again." And he said, "Fine, go with them." Right? So he got the permissive will of God. But here, Dave is neutral. Should I go to Keela? Yes. Oh, but my men are afraid. Let me go ask God again. Yes. Even though they're afraid. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even though you're afraid, church, go with God's word. God's word will always get the victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even if other people are afraid, you stay with God's word. Hallelujah. That's right. So, there we go. Twice he double checks his hearing from the Lord and make sure it's right. That's what I do, Brother Austin. I double check, Brother Vang, my sermons before I preach them. I make sure I got two or three witnesses on there. And if I don't, I don't preach it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'll just put that on the shelf for later. Like I said, I'll put that up there. Hallelujah. You double check. Now, go down to verse 9. Samuel 23:9. Now David feels a trap is getting set for him by Saul. Let's look at 9 10 11 and 12. Let's start with nine. And David knew that Saul secretly practiced mischief against him. And he said unto Abathar the priest, "Bring hither the ephod." Now remember the ephod was the outer robe or this outer vest that the high priest wore and it had 12 stones on it. Each stone was represented a tribe of Israel. So the high priest would go in with it on and it would flash with and maybe God would seem like God would speak and uh God would answer and the the stones would flash the light off the light off the ark of the the covenant would flash and that'd be a vindication of what God wanted to do. &gt;&gt; We're children of the light. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, when the word jumps off the pages, when God's word, when the light of the Holy Spirit shines on God's word, that's our proof that the word of God is for us. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now look what he says there in verse 10. Then said David, oh Lord my or Lord God of Israel, thy servant has certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come tequila to destroy the city for my sake. In other words, I'm hearing all this all this noise about me. I'm in trouble. I need your word. &gt;&gt; My life's in trouble. My testimony's in trouble. The enemies are after me. God, what should I do? &gt;&gt; Sound familiar to anybody? Hallelujah. Verse 11. Will the men of Keela deliver me up into his hand? Will Saul come down as thy servant hath heard? Oh Lord God of Israel, I beseeching us. See church, this is what we need sometimes. Desperation. Beseech means to beg. In other words, David's like, I'm begging you, God. Where do I do? Is he going to come down? A church. When have we got that sincere with God? &gt;&gt; That's what I'm talking about. There's times we got to be desperate where we know we're going to be desperate for the rapture. But if we want victory in our life today, we got to find ways to be desperate now. Hallelujah. I see he's begging. That means to beg. I beg you, God. &gt;&gt; This wasn't well Lord, you know what's your will? Okay, Lord. Okay, now I'll go out and I'll go hunting and try to get some game or something like that. It was I'm desperate. &gt;&gt; Lord, I beseech you. Am I going to die? A trap is set for me. The enemy is on my He's on my tail. Uh he he's got a trap set for me. I don't want to fall into the trap. I don't want my testimony marred. I want a testimony of overcoming. Hallelujah. I don't want to die. I want to live. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the Lord said he will come down. So the Lord shows him what the enemy is going to do to try to overtake his life. So now he knows what the enemy is going to do. He can find a way out of the enemy's plans. &gt;&gt; Oh, God always makes a way of escape. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, isn't that beautiful promise in 1 Corinthians 10:13? Temptation is common to every man. You've not gone through something that someone else hasn't gone through. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says in every case, God will make a way of escape. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's what he did here. God makes a way of escape for David. Church, we don't have to fall. We don't have to go into shame. We don't have to be defeated. If we seek God, God will show us the way out. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's beautiful. Did I read 12? Okay. Yeah, I'm sorry. No, 12. Then said David, will the men of Kela deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the Lord said unto him, they will deliver thee up. And so then David knew what to do. Hallelujah. God gave him thus sayith the Lord. Now that's the third third time. Is everybody keeping track? &gt;&gt; Three times he's gone. Three times he's got the victory. &gt;&gt; All right. Fourth time. 1st Samuel 30 7 and 8. This is one of the lowest spots of David's life. David is already on the run. He's left the promised land of Israel. He's living in the Philistine country. He went and fought some battles and left his wife and all the kids behind. And every one of them was taken away. Now, can we imagine like Vang and I uh going to work, coming home, and everything's gone. Everything in our house is gone. Brother Vang, can you imagine that? What an awful moment. And you know what David does? He doesn't go raging and doesn't go doesn't doesn't go try to rage himself like be a rage monster children. He doesn't try to be a rage monster and do what he wants to do. He goes to God in that moment. &gt;&gt; Does that remind you of somebody named Job? &gt;&gt; He lost everything. And what did Job do? Job says the Lord gives. The Lord takes away. Honey, don't talk like a foolish woman. Should should we receive good at the hand of God and not evil? Look at the integrity. The integrity of both men when they've lost everything is go to God. What's your will? What's going on, God? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It wasn't, "I'm done with Christianity. I'm done with this church. I'm done with the message." It wasn't that. It was like, "God, you're in control. You blessed me before. You've gotten me here, but Lord, I need to know what's going on. Show me. I'm going to you." &gt;&gt; I'm not turning on the God who had mercy and grace on me. &gt;&gt; I'm not turning on God's people just because something bad happened. &gt;&gt; The church said, What a beautiful story. Hallelujah. What does he say? He says, "Priest, bring me the hyot." In other words, in other words, that's in a difficult time, Malachi, bring me the Bible. &gt;&gt; Let's see what this is all about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where can I find myself in the scripture? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where can I find this situation in the scripture? Now, first friends, confess all your sins. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That you know nothing is held against you. If you're in a difficult trouble situation, confess all your sins and know that it's all under the blood &gt;&gt; because the Bible promises under the blood. Hallelujah. And then say, "God, somebody bring me a Bible. Somebody put on a sermon of brother Brandham. Somebody get me a prayer meeting. Somebody give me some time where I can just have a few minutes in the presence of God. Let me find God's will for my life." Why? We'll have to watch this week and see if anything happens this week. My goodness. I wasn't planning on that. He says, "Shall I p shall I pursue after this troop?" Now, you would think it'd be common sense. Yes, go get your wife and children. But David stops to ask, "Lord, what's your will? Shall I do this?" In other words, shall I do this now? Hallelujah. And he answered him, "Pursue, for thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all." What a promise. What protection David had. Amen. Even though he's out of the will of God, he's not in the promised land, he still got promises. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Church, if you've ever been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, you've got the promises of heaven. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You might be out of God's will, but yet you started in the promised land. Maybe you're out of it. Just remember, even though you're out of God's promise, God's promise is never out of you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God. If you've been buried in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, God's promise is with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. Even though David forsook God, God never forsook him. &gt;&gt; Even though there's times we forsake God's word or God's way, God will never forsake us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he gets the promise, you'll get it all back. That sounds like Job again to me. Job got it all back. All seven children if I'm not mistaken. Well, maybe had seven sons and daughters. I can't remember exactly. But he got everything back. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; By the grace of God. Now, not everybody does. We know that. But look at these men of integrity. In their darkest moments, they reach out to God. In other words, they say, "Where's my Bible?" &gt;&gt; I got to find what is what's going on. Where somebody will get on their phone and say, "Well, let me do Facebook or or let me do Instagram or let me do whatever. Let me do chat GTP to try to find the answer to my problems. We should go to God Almighty, church, &gt;&gt; right? Or let me call my dad or my grandma or my mama or or my even my pastor. He might be your pastor might be a help. Praise God. &gt;&gt; But you know, look at this. They're going to God. I need to hear from God. I need thus sayith the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, the hunger is to go to God and say, God, what's going on in my life? &gt;&gt; And God will show up and answer. So before David's king, church, there's four times that the ark is mentioned and all four times he hits it exactly. God never fails David when he goes to the ark. Now remember, did he go to the ark about Basheba? Of course not. The Bible said he despised the ark. That's the time where he set his Bible down and said, "I don't care what that says. I've got feelings. I've got passions. I've got desires. I'm going to do what I want to do." Church, be careful. Don't do that. &gt;&gt; Humble yourself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you do that, just say, "God, forgive me." Go back and pick it up. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Go back and pick it up and say, "I've got to do this. I've got to find God's will." &gt;&gt; Now, the next one. Now, there's five times after he becomes king that he speaks of or mentions or treats the ark in a certain way. 1 Chronicles 13:3. Yeah, this we read this on Wednesday. And let us bring again the ark of our God to us, for we inquire not at it in the days of Saul. So this imagine, brother Vang, this whole generation was used to not going to God. What were they going to then? What what what were they doing? I'm not doubting them because how often do we go to the word of God? &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about on Sunday and Wednesday. I'm talking about throughout the week. &gt;&gt; Yes. I ask you to open your Bibles. Look at that. Claw and Patrick. Great job, brother. Got the Bibles right open on their laps. Malachi's got the B. I I appreciate that. We're going to the Bible today. But I'm talking about when during the week when you go through difficult times, do you first think of the Bible? &gt;&gt; It's okay if you don't, but let may your second thought be scriptural. &gt;&gt; If your first thought is not scriptural, may your second or third be scriptural. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To get you back in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, church, look at look at the glory. Look at the This is why God honors David. He wants God's word to inquire of, to ask of. And this is why God honors our church. And God honors you because you want the ark of God in your life constantly. &gt;&gt; He He didn't want to ask, "Well, once in a while we'll go there." No. Every Sunday I'm going to go here. Every Wednesday, and all throughout the week, I'm going to go here. I was reading my Bible the other day and then some some later on in the day that verse came right out. I needed it right there when I was talking to somebody out in public. I couldn't remember exactly maybe it was when I was working there on Friday at my friend Adam's house. It was the very verse I read. It's like ah perfect right there. Amen. Just when I needed it. Praise God. See God God wants to speak to us every day. And so we got to make time to inquire of the Lord. Lord, what's your Bible say about this? &gt;&gt; Now you here's what I do. I can use chat GGP to find answers to my questions, right? Because it's a little faster. But then I got to go double check it in the scripture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You got to double check it in the scripture just like just like we've used Google for years. I used to just I mean it's just another form of Google, right? I used to Google where is this found? Where's that? And so we got to double check it. Make sure it's backed up in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The second mention, I love this one. 2 Samuel 6:1. And David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, 30,000. Look at this. Verse two. What a revival, brother. 30,000 message believers. And David arose and went with all the people that were with him from Baal of Judah to bring up from then the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the Lord of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubams. Verse three. And they set the ark of God upon a new car and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Giba and Yuza and the sons of Adanab drove the new cart. Now you remember the story. I'm not going to read all this. They're bringing the ark in the wrong way. It wasn't supposed to be on a cart. It was supposed to be carried by Levites, &gt;&gt; not by not by wooden animals, but by men. &gt;&gt; God's word always comes by living men. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so Usuza tried to catch it and steady it. And God smokeed him right there. And David's like, "What happened?" In other words, David wasn't He didn't ask about that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He didn't ask the ark. How do I carry the ark? &gt;&gt; He neglected the Lord on that. See, he got Look at that, church. He got caught up in the big meeting. &gt;&gt; Everybody got you? &gt;&gt; He got caught up in when the guest ministers come around. Now, there's I get I get excited too about Don't get me wrong, I love guest ministers. I probably love that more than when I'm just regular pastor because I get a break. No, I love it all. But in other words, he got all caught up in the big meeting, 30,000. But then he forgot to ask God, "God, is this how I bring your ark? Is this how the word supposed to come at the revival?" &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why I told my cousin, I said, "Yes, you can come on Sunday. I want you to give a testimony, but I'm going to preach first." &gt;&gt; See, the words always got to come first. &gt;&gt; That's true. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. And then the Bible said David danced with all of his might before the Lord. So the David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord with shouting. &gt;&gt; See that's what I This is my vision someday. Patrick and Claude mercy someday. My vision is see everybody in here shouting the praises of God. &gt;&gt; Then we're going to have revival. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Right. Didn't didn't Psalm 78 say when God rose up, he shouted. Glory. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In other words, when God is anointing you, something's got to go. You've got, Brother Am says, all this pressurees got up. So, you got to let the steam off. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Amen. We need the fire of God inside of us and it'll blow out some praises. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Glory to God. The word is here. I have thus, say the Lord, God's fighting for me. Hallelujah. My enemies are defeated. God's made me a conqueror. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. So, I'll do it for most of you today. Okay? &gt;&gt; I'll shout for the glory of God today. If you won't do it, I'll shout it. Thank you, Jesus, for the victory. Thank you, Jesus, for your word. Thank you, Jesus, for thus, sayeth the Lord. Hallelujah. Glory. Amen. I'm not under Satan's foot. Satan's under my foot. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All those scriptures about sleeping in Jesus, we've got victory over those. We're defeating Satan. He's under our feet. We're the conquerors. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That makes me want to shout. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Just like David, he danced with all of his might. He was praising God. Now I can have thus, says the Lord. I don't have to be like Saul. Glory. &gt;&gt; I don't have to be like that other generation. I can have God's word every day of my life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't have to be like my daddy or my father-in-law. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; I don't have to be like my mother-in-law. I don't got to be like my mama. I don't got to be like that other generation. I can have thus sayeth the Lord. I can hear from God myself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we just did more of that, we'd be happier. Yes. &gt;&gt; If we just went to God and g gave God 30 minutes or half an hour or I'm sorry, that's the same. Or an hour. Praise God. &gt;&gt; We'd be much happier. We would know what we're supposed to do because God showed us what to do. &gt;&gt; We're We're not guessing because God showed us the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what made David dance when he knew every day I can ask God about something. Anytime I need God, I can go to God's word and I've got thus sayith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Jesus. Amen. Look at 1 Chronicles 15:2. David gets the revelation. 1 Chronicles 15:2. David goes after somebody dies, after a great loss, a loss. After Usuza died, he he went back to the scripture. He says, "None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites." &gt;&gt; See, when tragedy happens, church, when tragedy happens, it's supposed to point you to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Now, listen. Well, if you want to, I mean, you're going to, but I mean, I was I talked to a man this week. He's a police chief. I told Malachi about it. He said, "My dad died unexpectedly a few days ago." I like, "Oh, I'm so sorry." No, I'm sorry. He did expectedly. Yeah. He had two strokes. And I said, "I'm so sorry." He's like, "Well, no, we knew it was coming. He loved the Lord." All these things. It's nice to know a chief that likes Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Police chief. He said, "But you know what I've learned? Uh about 15 years ago, we I had a niece that was seven years old and he she had some disease and she was only supposed to live like a few days. She ended up living seven years. He said, "But when she died at seven years old," he said, "that shook me to my core." And it taught me though at a young age, see church, we're talking about tragedy, right? Out of uza came learning. &gt;&gt; Out of tragedy came learning to put the word in its right place. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said when this sevenyear-old died, I don't know if it was cystic fibrosis or whatever it was, when she died at seven years old, he said, "I learned this lesson. Nothing else matters except God." &gt;&gt; Life is so short. Life is so temporary. &gt;&gt; Like Shang told me yesterday, he's getting old. &gt;&gt; Shang told me he's getting old. Brother Vang, I'm about ready to give him a big hug and say, "No, you're young, buddy." Hallelujah. But look, time goes so fast. &gt;&gt; He said, "When that seven-year-old died, it showed me I've got to love." He said, "With my fullness, I've got to enjoy every moment because we never know when people will leave this place and go to heaven." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, out of death or out of mistakes comes great learning if we'll only go back to the ark, back to the word of God like David did. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Death is a reminder to get your life with God right. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. And last uh this week I just talked to a man. He was playing beach volleyball. He's a good He's a Christian man. Now he don't believe the message, but he can be a Christian man. He was playing beach volleyball with another dad over in Copley. I think I told you a little bit about it. The man said, "I'm getting tired." He goes home. He passes out as his house. And so the family calls this other my friend and he goes over there. He tries to give him CPR, but he passed away. A man in his 40s. So just in the last three weeks, we have two men in their 40s that have passed away. What am I saying? We don't take anything for granted. &gt;&gt; We rejoice. We make the most of this service. We make the most of the time that we have. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now I said, "Are you okay? Do you want to talk to me?" He said, "No, I've already talked to my pastor. I talked to the doctor. All these things are being helpful." He said, "I feel encouraged in the Lord." &gt;&gt; But what is that? That's a reminder. Look to the word. Look to the ark. Hallelujah. When there's trouble, look to God. Spend time with God. God God has a day. Brother said, "God has a day. He's going to pull our card." &gt;&gt; I don't know if I can do this right. Brother said each one of us got a card and only God knows when that card's going to call. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God might say tomorrow calling Jesse home. &gt;&gt; Come forth son. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He called my card. I hope I got 40 more years because 50 50 whatever the Lord allows. But there's going to come a time he pulls the card. And church we may be ready. We might not be. But from each loss, let us remember there's something to be gained. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Your spiritual condition can improve. David gained from the death that happened to his fam. I'm sorry, to his church. We'd say he gained from that. Now we bring up the ark the right way. Now we got everything lined up with the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, I've talked to numerous men in the message, husbands that lost their wives. And one brother in particular told me out in Iowa, Brother Vang, you probably know he lost his wife. He said, "I was a mess for years. His wife cooked for him, cleaned for him, did everything for him." Brother Vang is basically like he got up. It's almost like his wife brushed his teeth, his wife helped him get dressed, and he just went to work. That was a brother that was addicted to Diet Coke and the Holy Spirit showed him it was and he couldn't walk upstairs. Brother Chris, he was drinking so much Diet Coke he couldn't even bend his joints. And then somebody said, "You should stop drinking Diet Coke and now I can walk up fine." That's all the trash that's in that stuff. Oh, that's right. They tried to hand that to me yesterday. Bless their hearts. I know I can't have it. Praise God. I I can't have it. &gt;&gt; But it took him years, brother. He even told me he fell out of church. Brother Isaiah's like, "Where you at? Where you at?" I'm struggling. I'm struggling. Church, it took him years to get this spot where he could finally get himself taken care of, get himself dressed. Come on, church. Get himself in the right condition. And now, brother uh brother Austin Sister, he's texting me verses to encourage me. &gt;&gt; Before he was so discouraged, he fell off the planet. I'm like, "What happened to brother? Where is he? How could he leave the message?" He wasn't. He was going through a dark season, but he learned even through the loss, he learned he's got to have his own walk with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now he's encouraging me. I'm like, "Thank you, brother." Hallelujah. Praise God. May God give you more fire. He's sending me quotes from Brother Bram. I'm going to send you one back. Hallelujah. You stir me up, I'm going to stir you up. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, church, out of losses, if you go to the word, you'll you'll find the victories out of the losses. There's a famous saying, sometimes you have to lose in order to win. &gt;&gt; David had to lose Usuza in order to win the thus sayeth the Lord. The perfect will on how to bring the ark up. &gt;&gt; Churchly, we all brother Brandon had to lose his wife and Sharon Rose in order to know who to go minister to the Pentecostals. &gt;&gt; That's hard for us to understand, but God did it in the Bible, right? There's Usuza. There's one example. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, there could have been things behind it like Job. Maybe it was just a test for brother Ram. Brother Ram says it was his his fault. But we don't know that's thus sayith the Lord. Hallelujah. In other words, things we don't always understand why we have trouble. Why do we have discouragement? Why do we have tragedy? But in every case, if we're still here, we still have the ark. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If we're still here, we still have the word of God we can try to I'm sorry, we should go to we should try with all of our hearts to go to and find what's your purpose, God, &gt;&gt; for this loss in my life. Hallelujah. And church, what did he do there? Go down to verse 25, 26, 27, 28 in 1 Chronicles 1500. David learned from this. If we've got the ark, now we can inquire every day. Now we can carry it the right way. In other words, we can bring the preachers back. Sister Beatatrice, no more tape players. We're going to bring the preachers back. &gt;&gt; It's going to come on the shoulders. Hallelujah. That's right. &gt;&gt; I was listening yesterday to spoken word original seed and brother Ram said, "Life only comes through the body." And you know, every one of these examples was like uh Peter to Cornelius. Every example was a living man, not a machine. Jose &gt;&gt; Philillip uh in the unic uses that he says oh he said glory. He said life always comes through the body. Life doesn't come through a machine. Life doesn't come from your phone. Life comes from a believer. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why I admire brother Austin. Brother Austin's been helping out Chris and going to different ones, right, brother? We talked about that. I told you that might be why you're born to go after people because life only comes through the body. &gt;&gt; It don't come through machine. &gt;&gt; Even my videos, that's good. I mean that but that's not me. That's not me physically there. &gt;&gt; And encourage you. Brother Ram calls that secondary. But the primary way is preaching or witnessing face to face. That's the primary mode for God to save souls. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody got that? I got less amen. So everybody must understand that already. Praise God. Or maybe it doesn't apply to your life right now. Ah 25 26 27. So David, the elders of Israel and the captains over thousands went up to bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the house of Edom with discouragement. &gt;&gt; When he had the ark, was he discouraged? Oh God, help us. Amen. God, help us to have some joy when we leave this place. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We've got Sorry, brother. We've got God's mind. We've got God's word. We've got thus sayith the Lord. We should have joy. Praise God. &gt;&gt; I mean, I was out I was at the denominational church yesterday. Thank God for it. But we know they don't have thus sayith the Lord, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And if it was my church, I'd say the same thing, brother. If it was Delta, Ohio, you know me, buddy. And it don't matter if it's a Catholic church or anything, you can tell they've got thus sayith the Lord. You can tell who's got the ark, church. We have the ark. We have thus say the Lord. We ought to live by it. We ought to inquire of it. We ought to be thankful for it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How did they act when they had the word of God joy? &gt;&gt; You know, when I talked to brother Mua, he said, "I want to thank you and the church for all your support when he lost his wife. &gt;&gt; We sent him a love offering, too." &gt;&gt; And he got remarried right away. He's like, "I was lonely. I want to be remarried. He's like, "Look at my bride." He said, he started showing me pictures of his bride. Look at my bride, brother. Okay. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. See, church, people remember every little kind thing you do when they're struggling. &gt;&gt; Try to reach out to them. &gt;&gt; Try to be an encouragement. Try to support them. Just text them. How many times did I invite him to church? Like five or 10 times. Now he's moving to Minnesota. And that's all right. But see, it shows in the in the dark times, in the in those in the trying moments, help out people. Reach out to them. And church, God God will vindicate to them that you're a man of joy. You're a woman of joy. You're a child of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bang, he was walking me through the church with his armor on my shoulder. He's He grabbed me by the shoulder. He starts coming. He said, "Come here, brother." I got like a a Holy Ghost escort from him. He was taking me around trying to get me food and water and everything like that. Like, I didn't expect all this. He was so happy to see me. Why, church? Because we've got the ark. Now, he's got more of the ark as far as than what he had. &gt;&gt; We believe if we have the message of the hour, we have the fullness of the word. &gt;&gt; All the mysteries revealed. Hallelujah. But he went from Baptist to Pentecostal. Amen. So, he went up. He went up from the stalk to the head of the wheat. Hallelujah. He's got more life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I move on from that. That just really blessed me yesterday. Okay. Now, 1st Chronicles 16 1-6. Now, let's read one and then uh I think we'll do six. One and six. So, they brought the ark of God and said in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God. Now, pause right there, church. Who remembers what I preached two Wednesdays ago? Throne of God. Now, you're the tent. Let's say I'm the tent. Ready? I'm the tent. You're the tent of God. So, you've got to put the word in your tent. &gt;&gt; That's what David did. Saul wasn't like that. Saul was like, "I'll just go fight. I'll do the best I can with my own efforts, with my own human strength. I'm taller than everybody. I'm handsomemer than everybody. I I'm the king. I can do whatever I want." It only got him five victories. &gt;&gt; But church, David said, "I want that ark living with me." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Nia, he said, "I want the ark in my heart every day." &gt;&gt; I know that's what you want, too, brother. Hallelujah. I want I want a tent for it. I want it to be right next to me. Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want the word to be in me in this tent. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And church, for some of us, we have to you're going have to memorize some Bible verses. &gt;&gt; Write them in your heart. I'm sorry. Plant them under your tent. &gt;&gt; If you don't memorize Bible verses, you need to start &gt;&gt; because that's the only thing you're going to have when the devil comes. All &gt;&gt; right? The devil's not going to shake if you just shake your Bible. He's not going to leave you shake your Bible. You've got to speak the word. &gt;&gt; The spoken word is the uh original seed. &gt;&gt; It's original power. &gt;&gt; There's power in the word. The spoken word. Go down to verse six. What did David do once he got it in the tent church? What'd he do? Baniah also and the Jezel the priest with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God. Did you know this? You probably know this. David was the first one to set up constant worship around the ark. So imagine the days of Moses, brother B, Aaron would go in there and be totally quiet except for the bells, right? Cam remember Cam preached on that. Holy, holy, holy. It just be quiet. Holy, holy, holy. He come out. Everybody's forgiven. The day of atonement's come. All your sins are forgiven. Ah, hallelujah. Glory to God. And they go out and sin the next day. One day they're all forgiven. Then it all s the next day. &gt;&gt; But with David, David gets the ark and as he's going in there, holy, holy, holy. I imagine David was out there a few times leaping, praising God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he did it when they got it, I imagine he did it a couple times after. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When when when Abathar goes in there, David's Let's praise God. Praise God in the sanctuary. Praise him in his mighty heavens. Praise him for his acts of power. Praise him for his surpassing greatness. Everything with breath. Praise God. Everything with breath. Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Abathar is like, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty." What I'm trying to say is their worship services were a lot better under David. &gt;&gt; When you've got the ark in your tent all the time, your worship services are a lot better. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Not some dead service, but they've got praise." David set that up. God needs to be praised. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Get some men and women with some gifts of the spirit on the instruments. Get some special singers. Get some clappers in here. Get some trumpet players. Let's have the gifts of God operating. Let's give God glory because God is here to answer our needs. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the hardest I preach in a long time. Hallelujah. I appreciate the polls. &gt;&gt; So see church, when the ark becomes more precious to you, you worship more. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You'll praise God more because now it's like it's not just something, well, I read my Bible sometimes or I worship God sometimes. Every day you ought to worship God &gt;&gt; because it's in your tent now. Hallelujah. Hey buddy, if you need to, you and uh Claude, you need to put Jesus music on if you don't do that already. You need to put Jesus music on in the morning at your house. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We got it going last week. I danced in the kitchen last week. Now, I got interrupted. I had to go take somebody to work. But I think Genevieve and I got started on a dance. Where's Genevie? Didn't we get started on a dance, Jen? Yeah, we because I just preached. I'm like, I haven't danced in my kitchen in a long time. Amen. It's time to get out the dances. Hallelujah. But see, this is what when the word becomes closer to you, that's what you do. You spend more time singing, praising God, giving God worship. You spend more time asking God what he wants. &gt;&gt; What does God want in your life, church? What does God want in your life right now? Hallelujah. What does God want in my life? Hallelujah. Last one. So, we've already gone through eight. Here's number nine. 2 Samuel 7:1 and2. I'm almost done. I I I forgot to set my timer. I moved it over there and I forgot to set my timer. This is the last mention of David with the ark. See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth with curtains. Oh, yeah. Look, he got look. Oh, yeah. Beautiful. Beautiful. Yeah. Came to pass when he sat in his house, the Lord had given him rest from all his enemies. Now, Brother Chris and I have been talking a lot this week, but brother Chris, there's going to come a time when you're going to get rest from all your enemies. Lena could say amen to that. &gt;&gt; I'm sure Austin could have some time. Vang Jose, you're going to have a time where you're like, oh, I don't feel all the enemies battling me so much. That's what David did. When David realized, my I've got victory over this. I got victory over that. I'm not struggling with that anymore. I got that. I got victory here. Then he starts thinking about, "Oh, I'd like to build a better place." In other words, I want God more permanent in my life. &gt;&gt; I want a permanent dwelling place for God in my life. What could I build God? What could my life really accomplish? What do I want to do for God that would be just greater than what I've done? Oh my church, may God help us. Amen. &gt;&gt; When we get to the spot where we get victory, that we can spend more of our time focused on what can I do for God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you understand, church? When you're fighting enemies, it's like, "God, do something for me. God, do something for me. God, do something for me." But when you get victory, it's what can I do for God? &gt;&gt; Right. God, pour out your financial be blessings. &gt;&gt; Pour out your power over temptation. God, give me this. Give me this. Give me this. But finally, David's like, "I've got it &gt;&gt; now. God, what can I do for you?" Amen. What can I do for Jesus? Hallelujah. Glory to God. And it's the last mention of the ark. Brother Mercy, he's got all enemies. In other words, God has awakened in his life. What can I do for God? God has awakened. God is here. I don't have to talk about the ark. I don't have to dream about the ark. I can go to the ark. &gt;&gt; I don't have to talk about the message. I don't have to wonder what the message says. I can go to the message. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And now what can I do for God? &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm going to build a house for God, a more permanent." In other words, I want every generation, Brother Jose, I want every generation to hear this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want all my children after me and my grandchildren of the Lord terrorists. I want all them to have a place where they can worship God. &gt;&gt; See, when you get victories over your enemies, now you start thinking about other people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not just your problems. &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, each one of us has to have to battle little problems, right? Little no matter where we are. But I'm just bringing out the point. Once you get victory over all these temptations and they're all put under your feet, now you can put all your attention on God. What can I do for you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How can I impact the children, the children's children? How can I impact the next generation? That's one thing I like about my YouTube videos. They can impact people far beyond me. &gt;&gt; Now, if YouTube goes down and goes to Rumble, I already got them saved. I can just upload them on there on Rumble, &gt;&gt; right? My books, I can pass those on down to the next generation. I want to leave something behind so that people knew what I believed. So people knew what the Bible says. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Something permanent for the next generation so that they'll know about the kindness of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; the love of Jesus Christ, the power of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Think about that today. What would you what would you do if you had all your enemies under your feet? Again, whether it was fear, lust, pride, money issues, job issues, if you had all that taken care of, what would you do? That would show whose heart you're after. If you were like David, you'd want to do something for God. God, what can I do for you? You have done so much for me, God. What could I do for you? You give me victory over pride and lust of the flesh and lust of the eyes. You give me victory over all my enemies and all my naysayers and all all all my critics and everything. You give me all these victories and none of them are bothering me. What could I do for you, Lord Jesus? &gt;&gt; What a position to be in. &gt;&gt; What a position to be in when all enemies are under your feet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, I don't expect everybody to be there today, but you should be hoping for that. You should be praying for that &gt;&gt; first. Get the ark in your life. Bring the ark and make a tent for it in your house. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Like, let me share this. Rod shared with Malachi this week, and Malachi thought it was maybe a word from the Lord. Rod worked at a jail for over 30 years. I think he said it was the most demonpossessed place he'd ever worked in. And Malachi, correct me if I'm wrong. He tried going there just on his own power, just his regular time with God, maybe a few minutes. And he he was failing. So he had to make a decision. I don't have enough power to defeat the enemies there. He said, "I've got to get more power." So what did he do? He woke up at what, 3:00, 3 in the morning. He worked first shift. He got up at 3:00 a.m. so he could read the Bible for 45 minutes and then could pray for 45 minutes. And church, he told me when he walked in there the first day, everybody's blasphemy in the name of Jesus Christ all around. He told me he took oil and he put it on all might be able to see the leftover. I had it up there. You could used to see the I anointed this room with oil. It used to be up there. I don't know where it went. He said he went through all the cells, right? He went through everybody's cell while they were cleaning the the prison. He anointed with oil and he's praying under his breath. In Jesus Christ's name, sanctify this place in the name of Jesus Christ. He said it took him six months, but by six months he only heard the name blasphemed only once or twice when before it was being blasphemed all day every day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, church. &gt;&gt; He said, "You've got to fight spiritual battles." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, that's a man who won't accept William Brandham as a prophet of God, &gt;&gt; but he respects him. &gt;&gt; What should you and I do &gt;&gt; when we know a prophet of God has visited this generation? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What should we do? That that's what I'm saying. Are you willing? He was willing to go. He's a sanctified man, church. He was willing to go further than he ever gone to get a result he never had. &gt;&gt; Getting up at 3:00 a.m. &gt;&gt; to make sure he could defeat the battles. The devil's at his job. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know where your devils are. You know where your devils are. &gt;&gt; You know, are they on the job or is it in your room, &gt;&gt; right? Or is it in your car? Where are the devils batting you most? Fight back with the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Put the ark in its place. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know you're getting tired. I'm not. Unfortunately, I'm just already I'm sweating. This the most I sweat a long time. You got to put the ark in its place. &gt;&gt; That's a great testimony. &gt;&gt; That's why before school, I always pray, read my Bible home. I know most times unless I sleep in and can't wake up this old tired carcass I got here. But you got to start you got to you got to get more power in here than the powers of darkness that you're going to fight against. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now church. Now, now we're not ignorant of how to overcome. You've heard it. &gt;&gt; If you need victory on your job, if you need victory in your house, you've heard it. You've got to go further than you've ever gone if you want victories you've never had &gt;&gt; because a man has walked in here and testified of it. And it's the it's the truth. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, thank God I don't have that many devils at my work. Brother Mercy, I'm thankful. I just got little kids that get little demons on them and they jump off. But that man had demons filled up with his workplace. And he said, 'I knew that was the only way I could get the victory was to put the word in its place every single day. Okay, in closing, guess how long is that recording? Hour and eight. Oh, I got plenty of time. Do a few few more thoughts. Uh, I've been listening to spoken words original seed and uh, Brother Brandham says there's a secret to being the bride. You know, there's a secret for uh, my wife to be my wife. She had to accept all my advances, right? Oh, you're beautiful. Would you go out on a date with me? That was before I was a Christian. You know, she had to accept my advances. There's a secret. She had to accept my word, right? Like Lena had to accept Austin's word. Cia had to accept Vang's uh request over the internet. Hallelujah. There's a secret, Brother Ram says, to being the bride. And it ties in perfectly with the ark. Here is what brother says. Here's the secret. How many know the secret to being the bride? &gt;&gt; A couple people did. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Here is the secret. The word is in the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. That's it. &gt;&gt; That's the only secret to being the bride. You've got the ark in the bride. You got the ark under the tent. You've got thus sayith the Lord in your soul. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the secret. Here's the secret. The word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name. She has thus sayeth the Lord. Now I'm not a prophet but I have thus sayith the Lord. We're supposed to gather more as we see that day approaching. &gt;&gt; We have thus sayith the Lord enter enter into his gates with praise and thanksgiving. Enter into his courts with praise. &gt;&gt; Yes. We have thus said the Lord. The five-fold ministry is going to bring unity to the bride and bring us to the stature of the fullness of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's why we come to church. &gt;&gt; In other words, everything we're doing today is based upon thus sayeth the Lord. That makes us the bride because the the word is at the very heart of it. And the bride only does what is thus sayith the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's a good clue why we're in this church and not another church this morning. Hallelujah. Like I told you for years, if I found a church that was closer uh and Vang and I, that's why we started the church with my wife and the other uh the other four that we started. If we knew a church that was closer that had thus sayith the Lord, we'd close down house and go go support them. But we never have. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we stand with thus sayeth the Lord. The word is in our hearts. That's why we're not bride of Christ fellowship just by name. We're bride of Christ fellowship because the word is in us. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And brother Ram said, "How do you know? When someone speaks against the word, you speak for the word." &gt;&gt; Brother Ram calls that the word test. &gt;&gt; When someone says something against the word, they've shown where they're at. And so you speak the word back. And that and then you pass the test, they fail the test. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the secret, brother. Brother Claude, the secret to high school. Let me tell you, the word is in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Patrick, let me tell you the secret to high school. The word is in you. &gt;&gt; Brother Chris, let me tell you the secret to working at a Amazon or delivery company. The word is in you. &gt;&gt; Jose is a grandfather. He's got all these grandchildren. Let me tell you the secret to being a wonderful grandfather and father and a great worker on the landscape and community. Brother, can I tell you the secret? &gt;&gt; Amen. The word is in you. &gt;&gt; Major, I use you a lot. Can I tell you the secret to middle school? The secret is the word is in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Genevie, our newest Christian. Let's give her a round of applause here. Let me tell you the secret, Genevieve, to serving God as long as Vang and Jose has and Beatatric. Let me tell you the secret. You want me to tell you a secret? The word is in you. &gt;&gt; Let's give God. Amen. It's not so much a secret anymore, is it? &gt;&gt; That's a secret. I wonder how I could get the victory. I wonder how I could get victory over all these enemies. My I fought the devil for so long. I've got a secret for you. The word is in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me know. I'll call you up and whisper the secret in your phone sometime. &gt;&gt; The secret's in you. &gt;&gt; The word is in you. &gt;&gt; They do only his will. No one can persuade them differently. No one will persuade you to be baptized in father, son, holy ghost &gt;&gt; or accept a sprinkling of water. &gt;&gt; No one be able to convince you of that. That's and that's the elementary things. Now, what about the other things? Well, it's God's will for you to have this gift or it's God's will for you to move to that there or go to that church or or it's God's will for you to this or this or that and the other. See how we need God's will more and more in our lives &gt;&gt; because the questions shift. The questions change as our lives go on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Should I go to college or not? All my friends quit. I went. I'm glad I went. I'm glad I heard the voice of God, Brother Chris. So, I get more time with my wife. I had to ask my wife this week, you know, or last week. I said, "Would it be better to have more money or less time with me?" She said, "I'd rather have more time with you." I said, "Thank you, Lord. I could use some more money. Who couldn't?" All these bills come up. I go to the dentist. It cost me $2,400 to go to the dentist. That's before insurance. Just think about it. I mean, just think about how life changes. But we got to make choices. and other people, you know, and church, just trust God will guide those people the way he wants them to go if they're willing to listen to the ark of the covenant. &gt;&gt; They have thus sayith the Lord or they stand still. Then they do the works of God, for it is himself in them, continuing his word to fulfill as he did as he did not complete all the word in his day. In other words, Jesus didn't fulfill all the prophecies. There's something for you to fulfill. Pardon me. I got two more verses and I'm closing. Everybody take a deep breath. Ready? Round two. Here I go. John 5:20. Feeling a second wind of the Holy Spirit here. Hallelujah. John 5:20. Here's the verse, Brother Ram says that proved Jesus had the secret of God. Let's read it together. One, two, three. For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth, and he will show him greater works than these, that he may marvel. This is the verse brother Ram uses to show the secret. The secret to high school, the secret to be a delivery driver. I'm a pastor, Malachi. What's the secret for me to be in the bride? Tell me what's the secret. &gt;&gt; What's in me? Word. &gt;&gt; The word's in me. Thank you. Sometimes I forget. Having all the trials in my life, sometimes I forget. What's the secret? How do I know I'm the bride? The word's in me. &gt;&gt; But where do I get the word? How does the word get into me? It comes from my father. &gt;&gt; See, you must have a close relationship with your spiritual dad. &gt;&gt; You must cry, daddy. Daddy, aba, father. Aba, aba, I don't know which way to go. I need your direction, Aba. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Aba, what what what do I do? I don't know what to do. Lord, show me. Amen. And church, you can use this verse. Lord, you showed Jesus, so you have to show me because I'm He was the firstborn among many brethren and I'm one of the brethren. How many brethren do we have here of Jesus here? &gt;&gt; Oh, we got a couple. Amen. Thank God for that. Hallelujah. I'm one of his brethren because I follow him. Amen. &gt;&gt; I was baptized in his name. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm one of his brethren. Chris, you're one of the brethren. Praise God. You've been buried in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. So all you have to say is, "Daddy, dad, show me. Show me what I need to do and I'll go do it." John 8:29. Let's read that one. My last verse. Let's read it. 1 2 3. And he that sent me is with me. The Father hath not left me alone, for I do always those things that please him. Let's stand to our feet. How many enjoyed the word today? Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's thank God for the word. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Here is the secret. The word is in the bride. Let's invite our musicians as well by God's grace. Let's get your Bibles like we do on Wednesday. Everybody get your Bible. Not everybody here was on Wednesday. That's understandable. Everybody's got work and things. Get your Bibles out here. The word has to be in you to be the bride. And brother Ram would later on go to show Mary had the word in her that made her the bride. Hallelujah. That made her the mother of the son of God. The word was in her. I like you to hold up against your your your heart, would you? Your natural physical heart. Hold up there. This is the secret to being the bride. I'm glad God whispers his secrets to us. Hallelujah. Amen. He lets us know that we're his bride. She only does his will. No one can convince her otherwise. Let's bow our heads, church. I don't know where you're at today. Are you at the spot where you're trying to fight off enemies like David was? You might be there. Maybe you're fighting off sickness, fear, doubt, discouragement, critical spirits, lust, uncertainty, financial difficulty, doubt. Maybe you're fighting an enemy today. Your answer is the ark. Your answer is inquire at the word of God. [Music] Now, I'm not going to ask you to raise your hands, but I would guess if I if I said, "Who's fat fighting an enemy today?" I'd imagine lots of arms would go up. Amen. I saw some heads nods. Praise God. I mean, you're in a fight right now. You might be fighting off an enemy, and you're just struggling to overcome this enemy. Remember, God's favor for you is proven because that enemy has not triumphed over you yet. That proves God favors you. You're still in church. You still got the right attitude. You're still sweet with people. You still love people. You still worship and shout and praise God. Some of you clap your hands today. Some of you raise your hands maybe are shouting for the first time in a while. Praise God for that. Hallelujah. But when God is moving in your life, he defeats the enemies. Hallelujah. As you let him. So that's one group. You're fighting enemies today. Or maybe you're at a spot where all enemies are under your feet. You're walking in victory. And so your prayer today is, God, what can I do for you? I don't need victory over my enemies. I already got it by your grace. &gt;&gt; You brought reproach upon my enemies. You smitten them on their backside and I stand as a as more than a conqueror today by the grace of Jesus Christ. You're in one of these two camps today. But church, thankfully for us, we've got the answer. No matter which camp you're in, you've got the ark against your heart. [Music] As we pray, church, you pray for whatever you need. Listen, whether you're fighting enemies or whether you need something to do for God, pray for it. And then listen, we'll take a I'll set my timer. Let's listen for three minutes. And we Let's listen for three minutes and see if God would just speak something to your heart. Church, we don't spend enough time listening. Brother R said, we do all the talking sometimes. We need to listen to God. And church, I don't even don't even bother me if you sit down and open your Bible and start reading. If God puts a scripture on your mind, go read it. But let's go to the ark. Let's go to thus sayaith the Lord. That's what David did. That's what set him apart. So I was like, well, one time I'll spend half a minute reading my Bible to try to find God's will. Let's spend some time finding God's will. Let's pray. Father God, these are the people you placed under the sound of my voice to preach to them. Lord, most of them would call me their pastor. Lord, I imagine. Thank you, God, that the sheep have heard from the great shepherd today. Lord, I preach your word. This came off a lot different than I thought. Lord God, I pray for them in Jesus Christ's name. Lord, holding their Bibles next to their tent, Lord God. Hallelujah. That's what David did. It's what made him a man after your own heart. Hallelujah. He brought the ark into a tent. And Lord, this is symbolic. We're bringing the ark into our tents. Father, if they need victory over enemies, I pray you'd show them the victory. We went through Brother Rod's testimony. Hallelujah, Jesus. Lord, may we be willing to do things we've never done before to get victories we've never experienced before. Lord, I pray victory for the church. I pray against the enemies fighting the church in the name of Jesus Christ. Oh God, let us be victorious, Lord, for the glory of God. Bring a revival, Lord, if it's your season, God. May we not be sleeping on Jesus, but may we be awake unto righteousness. I pray, you know the thoughts intents of the heart, Lord. I don't. So, I pray for each person who needs victory over the enemies. May they hear from the ark, Lord. I pray for those who have the enemy under their feet. They're not currently addicted. They're not currently struggling. They're currently not under any condemnation. I pray for them that they'll look up to heaven and say, "Lord, what should I do for the next generation? What can I do for somebody outside of me? You've already given me the victory. Well, how can I help out others, Lord?" Now, church, I'm going to set a simple timer. Let's listen for three or five minutes. You talk to God. You got the ark. You know the secret of the bride. The word is in her. I'm going to pray for my life. Hallelujah. Let's start.
