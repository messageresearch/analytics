continue on the book of a fusion series I believe this is part 22 we ended last Wednesday's service with verse 21 in fusions 521 so let's read Ephesians 5 21 and 22 we also have our memory verse so we'll get to that as well by God's grace seasons 521 let's all read that one together on three one two three submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God Bob you would let's go to Roman's 12:1 and 2 this is our memory verse 4 March let's read this together and as we read it we trust the Holy Spirit to write it upon our hearts that we can lay ourselves upon God's altar tonight tomorrow and every day on three let's read that together one two three I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and need not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God let's have a word of Prayer that we need on your heart let's just make it learner to God here surely God's Word will it'll cut it it'll slice it also feed it'll also quench the thirsty Heavenly Father we love you we thank you for your word they give her the Holy Spirit Lord who gets into the word quickens the word and makes it alive annoys me Lord to preach nor it's under different circumstances but Lord we know ever two or three are gathered you're there in the midst so Lord we just ask God that your Holy Spirit would speak to every heart cut off Lord any sins of the flesh Lord God circumcise our hearts Lord God it was quickening power Lord Jesus and father maybe their lives here on your your altar of sacrifice that we can be shining lights signing testimonies bright stars Lord God salty salt that we might be the kind of Christians Lord your Bible calls us to be a holy calling anoint us now here I pray in Jesus Christ's name every said Amen god bless you maybe see it there in your homes so now we're willing we'll look at Ephesians chapter five and we want to mainly look at the family here or the marriage rather tonight we'll look at that I just want to emphasize a little bit Ephesians five verse two so I'm going to pull that up real quick seasons 5 2 is just kind of as a little background to tonight's message visions 5 to 5 in 5 1 & 2 be therefore followers of God as dear children and walk in love as Christ hath also loved us and have given himself for us and offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour I just want to start with this verse here because in this verse it calls all Christians that word ye means everyone so everyone needs to follow God imitate God and when we imitate God we walk like Christ and the Bible said walk in love because later we'll be looking at how a husband is to love his wife and a wife is submit is to submit to her husband and so we know this is done through the man in love he loves through God's love but the woman submits through God's love and that's her expression of God's love but I just want to point out of course that you know chapter 4 begins the practical application of how we love people right chapter 4 verse 1 begins the walk and warfare theme of this book that Paul gives us the first thing was the believers exalted position in Christ chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world and then in chapter 2 you get into the truth concerning the body of Christ were all saved by grace God's broken down the middle wall of partition Jew and Gentile are almost saved by the same blood the same covenants and we're all part of one holy temple one tabernacle the body of Jesus Christ but in chapter 4 we begin the walk in warfare of the believer and of course chapter 4 begins with the unity of the Church one spirit one faith one Lord one baptism and then it gets into the fivefold ministry which is what we're earning contending for today we know there's a great attack on the fivefold ministry today to try to silence her in order to just exalt one man William Branham and of course we believe William Branham was God's prophet but we don't get rid of the fivefold ministry like many people do today and so the Prophet even taught that the voice is now in the bride the spirit and the bride and the Prophet will all be saying the same thing and that will have already been said in God's Word and so in chapter 4 it builds up with the fivefold ministry uniting the body of Christ and then as Christians were to put off the old man and then put on the new man which speaks the truth in love and doesn't give place to the devil forgives doesn't steal that is generous and doesn't and strives not to grieve the Holy Spirit of course we'll all grieve the Holy Spirit throughout the day if we when we fall short of the glory of God but we got to repent quickly and invite the presence of the Holy Spirit back into our minds and linking our minds as the mind is the area of the greatest battle ever fought so and then immediately after chapter 4 it gets into chapter 5 and says walk in love so it's emphasized here to walk in love now we've worked our way through chapter 5 with the fruits of the spirit and how the wise will redeem the time foolish people will waste time but the wise virgins the wise Christians redeem the time they make the boot the best and wisest use of time they use it for the kingdom of God they seek first the kingdom of God and Christ's righteousness in their own life and then everything in the natural is added unto them praise God and then we saw saw how Paul gives us a very easy formula to walk in the spirit he told us then don't be drunk with wine he told us to sing to each other so sing songs together and then he said sing songs in your hard to make melody into God and then he says give thanks in everything even in the a this time of coronavirus and pandemic we're supposed to give thanks for all things to God in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then he says submit yourselves one to another last Wednesday we looked at that we submit ourselves to the government as long as they line up with God's Word we submit ourselves to the elders in the church the older Christians we submit ourselves to church leadership pastors and deacons we submit ourselves to to anyone we submit ourselves to other believers man or woman and trying to help them out as we can as it's allowed in God's Word of course we'll never break God's Word trying to submit to someone else but we always obey God's Word in all things so in other words the way up and God is down submitting ourselves to others serving others seeing how we can help others in this hour and now we're getting to tonight Scripture we see verse 22 speaks of wives for three scriptures and 25 it gets in two husbands for numerous more scriptures and then Paul calls this a great mystery in verse 32 and then he gives a great summary in verse 33 well we want to just labor on that tonight even if you're not married remember this applies to everyone because Paul says marriage is only a symbol of how the church should submit and love Jesus Christ so please don't tune this out please don't jump on your smartphone look at other things please don't just stare off into the blue you know try and focus here we can see through this through the mystery of marriage God's got unfolds hid the relationship that we should have as the bride the earthly bride to the heavenly bridegroom now I want to start I promised you last week I want to start with some history about the Roman and Ephesian culture now of course Ephesian culture was greatly influenced by Rome of course in that time in Paul's day Rome was that major Kingdom upon the earth has even told by Daniel and it still remains not natural Rome but spiritual Rome as the the Beast of this hour but I want to read you some history about the Roman culture that would have been very prevalent and would have with Ephesus being the second largest city outside of Rome itself the culture would have spilled over into Ephesus so I want to read first maybe take 10 maybe 15 minutes read over this history so you can have an idea of how Paul's words would have been so radical especially took young Ephesian Christians or even dissenters of Ephesians that were sinners that maybe came into the church while Timothy was reading this letter from the Prophet Paul it would have been so shocking it just would have been just unheard of to hear what Paul was telling in commanding men and women on how to how to guide their marriage how to develop their marriage according to God's calling for them so let me just give an introduction I'm just going to read a little bit here if you can part of that just please ask the Lord let's ask the Lord just near Jesus help us just to keep our attention on the things of God here for a moment it is through the example of Jesus Christ that women owe most of their freedoms to today the advent of Christianity raised the dignity freedom and rights of women to levels never before known in any other culture or religion indeed as one historian wrote the birth of Jesus was the turning point in the history of women praise God that's right because you know through Eve that women fell but is through Mary's faith Mary's belief and the birth of this we'd say the immaculate seed here the Immaculate Conception this is how God redeemed woman praise God and of course man Eden - but especially women because she's the weaker vessel and she's the one that fell first through deception so this is the turning point praise God the new you so as a result of Jesus Christ and his teaching women today in much of the world especially in Western civilization enjoy far more privileges and rights than at any other time in human history praise God let's look at some history on women in the Middle East even today women in the Middle East especially those in countries where Christianity is not very accepting like in Muslim countries on Christian women have been publicly abused and flogged in Sudan for failing to wear the Islamic garments that women are supposed to wear to cover their heads faces and entire bodies can you imagine that under the Taliban rule in Afghanistan women are forbidden to go to school forbidden to work outside the home or even walk without their whole face and had been covered under that a body I think it's gone it's also illegal in Saudi Arabia for women to drive a motor vehicle so think about that this is what other religions and this not just a few people this is millions if not billions of people also one thing that was commonly practiced in other religions was polygamy now polygamy is permitted in Christianity and we've taught on that extensively but if you have any questions on that please contact us Christianity has always rejected polygamy because it rejects devoted love and devote it rejects the singleness of love between one man and one woman as Jesus quoted in Matthew chapter 19 remember Jesus Christ took us back to the Garden of Eden God suffered the Old Testament Moses and Abraham and David and Salman God suffered them to have wives and concubines and then even divorces in the days of Moses but Jesus takes us back to the beginning he takes us back to the days of Adam and Eve and that's where Christianity goes back [Music] Christian's maintain love is between one man and one woman if not in other religions then love is just mere lust it is not love so in polygamy it's mostly lust but in Christianity is based upon love because no woman who really loves her husband can tolerate having another wife can't share him with another woman and the same thing with a man any man that really loves his wife can't share her with any other man so see monogamy gives recognition and status and value to a woman I looked it up on Google did you know the Prophet Muhammad he was the founder of Islam had at least 11 wives Google said he at 11 this article says 16 plus 2 concubines Muhammad's successor caliph Umar married 7 women and had to slave concubines the Caliph of man had married 8 women Muhammad's son-in-law had 11 wives and 19 slave concubines Muhammad's grandson Hasan married 70 women and had at least 31 children Muhammad also authorized temporary marriages which would be for three nights or more but thereafter the man could leave the wife and then without any obligation so she had offspring he was we wasn't obligated to her that's the kind of leadership that's the kind of lust that is in that religion so it's not genuine love like Jesus Christ love like Christianity so like Jesus said by their fruits they're known so Muhammad is known by his corrupt fruits and so here we look and see Islam denies the value of a genuine Christian or godly marriage divine love they reject exclusive lifelong devoted love and polygamy erodes the concept of a Christian family so Christianity is the only real model of a marriage that God wants children to grow up under so thank God that our children thank God that many of us were raised under a godly example a true example of Christ and the church one man and one woman now let's look at some sins of Rome let's look at the depravity of Roman culture this as few people can understand how highly promiscuous and depraved cultures were before the advent of Christianity a British historian wrote that marital faithfulness in the Roman Empire was virtually unknown in other words there were hardly any Roman men that even considered being faithful to their wives so adultery and fornication were completely common in the Roman civilization all kinds of evil lewd practices of speaking of course intimately were prevalent it was everywhere these evil acts were illustrated even in the house on lamps bowls cups and bases so everywhere you looked in a Roman home there was evil acts we'd say with prostitution or fornication or bestiality or homosexuality or polygamy all these kind of evil acts romans and greeks of course also exercised and bathed publicly in the nude it was just an awful awful culture to grow up in there's such things that went on such evil things I can't even read these such as by the emperor Titus and emperor Domitian and Emperor Caligula just some of the most awful forms of sexual sin or intimate sin you would ever want to read about even with even with abuses with animals and young children it was just common and it was public and it was just so wicked and evil the earth needed good news praise God the world needed Jesus Christ desperately desperately and thank God that God sent His Son praise the Lord because he birthed out of Christ and Christianity birthed a finally a holy lifestyle a godly lifestyle no doubt Jews many Jews lived a godly lifestyle but we're speaking of a spirit-filled the Jews didn't have the spirit filled Holy Ghost filled life that Christians like Paul had right like Peter had they didn't have this extra power in the soul praise God the seal of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost and so this was a great change was to see Christians who were born again in the middle of Rome in the middle of Ephesus living as Jesus called them to live also here's something else about Rome in Rome adultery was only on the marital status of the woman in other words a man could not be taken to court for adultery men just had the freedom to to lie with as many women as they wanted to and the women could never the women did not have the right to come to court and accuse their husbands of committing adultery adultery was only convicted upon a wife it was perceived as a crime only a woman could commit and it was not an issue that pertained to the man how how wicked and evil is that women in ancient Rome let's look at some of their rights they really had very few rights and privileges compared to men women Roman wives were not allowed to be present with a husband's guest at a meal so think about that just made me think of Aquila and Priscilla they're in Ephesus how they spoke unto Apollo slightly spoken to Apollo's about the things of God well in really in those type of cultures priscilla's should not even have been there but see with Christianity they gave that woman a little bit of freedom gave her great freedom to testify to Apollo so of course she wasn't preaching she wasn't teaching but Priscilla would testify like the woman who at the well who went down there in Samaria the Samaritan who testified and told him the great things Christ had done so the same thing Priscilla would have done by the grace of God a Roman woman her wife was placed under the absolute control of her husband who could divorce her sell her into slavery or even have her life taken at his own will the Roman woman was prohibited from inheriting property remember even Judaism gave the widows and the daughters property the Roman women were prohibited prohibited from speaking in public and they were not allowed to speak in court they couldn't be a witness in court the Roman man had supreme absolute power over his children a man could even have hid his married daughter put to death so a father can even have his married daughter put to death how wicked how incredibly evil was this culture he had full authority to chastise even to beat them his wife and his children and grandchildren there was nothing there was no evil that was held back from Roman men or we'd say Ephesian men but then Jesus Christ came praise God and then the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost hallelujah and then it spread to Cornelius his house and the rest of the Gentiles then Paul took it on his three missionary trips thank God for Paul and Barnabus being separated by the Holy Ghost to take the hope for families the hope for children and fathers and parenting and mothers and there were all the hope for the Christian family came as Paul and Barnabus took the gospel and spread it and it signs wonders and miracles to show the world what real love looks like craze gotta thank God we get to experience it today amen praise God so into this wicked environment of Roman and Ephesian culture comes the Christian message and lifestyle this was a radical revolutionary an extremely offensive lifestyle to the Ephesians where Paul would preach you shall not commit adultery yet that was what they did all the time Paul would preach marriage is honored by all and the marriage bed should be kept pure and God will judge the adulterer and all the sexual immoral they didn't want to hear it they hated it in fact hid Roman history says that it was very common just for the word Christian to be a hated word it was like a cuss word because they the Romans felt such a fence they felt judged right they they felt condemned by Christians but see it wasn't the Christians condemning them it was God's Word condemning them which it was meant to jesus said the Holy Ghost when he comes he'll convict the world of sin praise God so the preaching will always convict the sinner and so the sinner must repent the sinner must come to God humble themselves admit they're wrong and ask God to pardon them forgive them and create in them a care creating them a desire to serve God Paul would preach as he did here in Ephesians 5:21 submit to one another out of reverence for Christ Paul Peter would say be considerate and live with your wive's and treat them with respect in first Peter 3:7 and this was unheard of this was just it was so countercultural and no doubt it caused much persecution upon the Christians but as we know the more persecution came upon the Christians the more spread hallelujah thank God so Christian insisted that intimacy be confined to marriage and that made Ephesians of Senate Paul priests and have made the Ephesians very upset the sinners of course and they believe that the intimacy act made a man and woman one flesh and they were supposed to stay united together for life well that was unheard of as well but Paul used that same language from Genesis about how they should be one flesh they're not they're no longer two they should not be and I should not share intimacy with anyone else just that one individual the one spouse very radical concept so Christianity here's hit one is one historian said this the dignity of marriage was restored by the Christians oh thank God the dignity of Adam and Eve praise God the dignity of Isaac and Rebecca praise God of Jacob and Rachel Jacob Leah Abraham and Sarah the dignity of those marriages was brought back through the cross of Jesus Christ and the the filling of the baptism of the holy ghost praise God history even says this prior to Christianity the marriage ceremonies were anything but dignified so imagine going to a wedding now most of us we can sense how sacred and how special wedding is but it wasn't like that in Ephesus and Rome it was more of like a playful kind of like a bar event or like a a theatre event history says because of the low regard of women and marriage as a whole wedding ceremonies contained obscene songs they would have songs with cuss words and and mockery and open displays of extreme wickedness and they were all part of Roman weddings so it was just like a how like a stand-up comedian would be kinda be like a wedding ceremony can you imagine and the more lewd the more of the Roman men and a fee men liked it their wedding ceremony of course I doubt they had any vows at the ceremony because they obviously would never keep them so it was like an evil stand-up comedy like a late-night show or some evil thing like that mockery and and evil songs that was the wedding ceremony but when Paul started doing Christian weddings then Christianity the Christian wedding ceremony became to be a very dignified beautiful solemn holy sacred ceremony like it is today for Holy Ghost field Christians praise God and they had never seen this before can you imagine sinners you know being invited to a wedding Paul or Timothy would perform in Ephesus or Apollo's and would be so sacred and the man would look into his wife's eyes and she look into his and they'd hold hands and they would make promises and the sinners would hear these promise and said how could this what do you mean this man's gonna do this and what do you mean he's gonna love his wife and be faithful to her how is that possible are they joking what a fool think they'd say so they came to hate that the sinners came to hate the Christians now if you'd like a link on that I'd be happy to share that with you that kind of concludes the historical part now hopefully church hopefully that opens our eyes to the power of this passage because the way we raised we're raising them in a society where women already have a lot of freedom but that's not the society that Paul was writing here when he wrote this letter to the Ephesians he's writing to a society where women hardly had any dignity hardly had any rights and men were allowed to be brute beasts but today thank God we're not men aren't beasts men are examples of Christianity men put on the the Bible says on the Lord Jesus Christ amen men put on the Spirit of Christ and live like a man should live praise God [Music] now I preached you know I think I preached six or seven Mayor's banquet so I'm not going to get in the coats of brother branham on marriage most of you are familiar with them I preach them many times but if you'd like them I'm happy to give you them I could mail them to you or email them rather well brother I am one thing I just want to say brother am said always keep the honeymoon always make sure brothers your wife remains your sweetheart and sisters that your husband remains your gallant boyfriend your virtuous strong boyfriend right and of course this is easier said than done Satan's first attack on humanity was in their home the Garden of Eden against a family Adam and Eve and then of course we know akin sin in his home stop the invincible army of Joshua and so it is today the reason we don't see more miracles the reason we don't see people finding their gifts of the Spirit the reason we don't see more of that is because sin is committed in believers homes and they failed to get victory over that and they come to church under the wrong spirit and so the holy spirit can get a full preeminence over the entire flock of course there's times where the holy spirit can get victory in different areas and we'll see miracles and healings and we'll see discernment and we'll get words from the Lord thank God for those times but the Christian army really is the body of Christ really is invincible the only thing that can take her is God allowing her to die and then she goes home to get her reward praise God eternal life when the Christian army has always been invincible Paul would say Oh death where is your sting Oh fear where is it Oh grave where is your victory but thanks be to God who gives us our victory through the Lord Jesus Christ Paul knew he was invincible right as far as God was going to help him overcome he was an overcomer he said grace is what is causing me to labor more not i but the grace of god that's in me and that's with me and so you know we know the quotes our brother Graham said every morning his family prayed first before they had breakfast he said they would kneel down and pray but then brother Ram especially in 1964 questions and answers series brother branham gives us a real look into the into his house how he had numerous teenagers and I just saw him quote before service program said Nita and I constantly fuss at Rebecca and Sarah to wear modest clothes just to wear modest clothes he said they were constantly fussing so they must have been coming in through their friends not sure how they got in there but he said there was constant fusses and we remember how Rebecca slammed the door and program said that was the devil and so there's a lot of tests and trials in homes and so brother Graham's home wasn't immune from it he had to keep applying the token right had to keep praying for his wife and and praying for the the teenagers and praying for his entire family and so we know we can we can get the victory but just like any promise footsteps our possession we got to take one day at a time we gotta rip the lead especially our brothers we have to lead by example one day at a time and let the love of Christ flow through us into our family and invite the prends of Jesus Christ in order to cleanse us first and then cleanse everyone in our home and in our families now let's see if we can let's now get to the text here it's 8 o'clock ok I try to go about 1/2 hour more by God's grace I appreciate everybody's attention crazy so hopefully it's been a blessing so far to see the history and to see now what a radical dr. and Paul was preaching many times we take it for granted but we can't let these things be taken for granted and anyone that served the Lord long enough knows that in our flesh we're gonna fail we're gonna fall short that's why Paul said renew your mind daily every day you got have to have a transformed mind as we get older we oftentimes get weaker right the spirits willing but the flesh is weak we get weaker so anyone that's been serving the Lord a long time or any amount of time realizes they got to fight their flesh to get the revival back they have to die to their will daily that the will of God might be done now in verse 22 Ephesians 5:22 is where we want to start now it's interesting here he says wives submit yourselves unto your own husband's as unto the Lord now this would not have been asking a whole lot right because women couldn't say anything in public women could even meet with the guests at the dinner table so this was familiar to Middle Eastern women submission but Paul says in anyway it's interesting he starts with the woman I'm not sure why but it's brash because Eve was first deceived so maybe that's why Paul wrote about that in first Timothy 2 verses 12 to 14 he said Adam was first formed then Eve and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression so for some reason Paul is led by the Holy Spirit to write to the sisters first he tells them to submit to their own husband's as unto the Lord now again it's important to note he's saying married sisters submit to your own husband's right there's a great temptation for sisters and of course brothers too but in this case we'll look at the sisters because that's what the scripture says there's a temptation for sisters too long to be with someone else right Satan will inject those thoughts and it's not something we enjoy but Satan injects those thoughts the grass always looks greener on the other side and the natural Satan wants us to look at a better car better house and it's natural times where Satan will inject a thought well if you're only married to that person it'd be so much better but Paul tells us the Holy Spirit in our sisters lives will teach us to submit to our own husbands for the sisters now because the Bible said what God has joined together let not man put asunder sisters we must go back in our minds and remember the happy day we got married the happy day you got married you stared in that man's eyes and were so thankful remember that that special feeling you felt when he proposed to you and when you were married and how thankful you were for your wedding day I trust by God's grace that's how you felt because most sisters in America weren't forced to be married they had the choice right and so we must remember that you believed at one point and you should always believe that that God joined your marriage together and that God doesn't want it put asunder and so you must here by the Holy Spirit by the love of God learn to submit to your own husband's as unto the Lord so we know it flows through the Lord so if a sister is submitting to God she will also submit to her husband of course as long as the husband is asking her to do godly things she doesn't have to submit to a sin so see a a sister then she's committing to keeping her vow to God and all the wedding witnesses from her wedding day she's committed to that she submits as unto the Lord for submission to God's man her husband shows her submission to her Lord and Jesus Christ modeled the submission when Christ only did that which pleased the father so even Christ had said had headship as first from the ends 11 taught that God is the head over Christ right the invisible spirit is head over the body of Christ and then the man is the head over the woman as Christ is the head over the man well let's read of Philippians 2:5 through 8 real quick we get a good picture of Jesus's submission let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God the amour faith God the image of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God now the part that was equal was the Holy Ghost inside of him but Jesus's flesh was not equal with God right because Jesus flesh could die but God the Father could never die so we have to be careful we apply the scripture you know I've sadly I've heard the false doctrine of people using the scripture to say that that we're so equal with God that we are the ones who wrote the book of life now I say that in respect and reverence but I just disagree the scripture that's not what the scripture is saying the scripture is saying we take the mind of Christ he knew he was the image of God and there was a part of him that was equal to God the Holy Spirit inside of him right just like we know when we speak God's Word it's the same as God speaking because it is God speaking that part of us when we speak God's Word now it doesn't happen very much right it doesn't happen all the time but the times that we speak supernatural things and it happens that part the spoke was equal with God because it was God it wasn't us because we have no power to bring anything to pass so let's balance that scripture Jesus the the Spirit of God in Jesus was equal with God remember even Jesus is human mind he didn't know the day in the hour when he'd return he didn't know that Jesus didn't know who would touch him or that woman that touch him with the blood issue he didn't know so see that part of Jesus wasn't equal with God it had a word nature sinless nature but it wasn't eternal the flesh was eternal but now the flesh is eternal so it's different now but when Jesus was on earth it was different the flesh wasn't eternal it was mortal flesh right it was in the likeness of sinful flesh right but it wasn't sinful all right verse 7 but he made himself of no reputation god help us to do this that we don't try to make our own reputation now here's here's how we make we make our reputation we let our actions speak louder than our words we don't have that we don't have to tell people right away that we're a Christian we don't have to tell people right away that we believe the message of the hour we don't have to tell people right away that we believe william branham was a prophet we want people to see that we know jesus christ that our soul our seal with Jesus Christ spirit just by our life that we live praise God and then you get a reputation that way people will know that Haven Smith loves the Lord people will know that Karras and Lydia and Malachi Smith love the Lord because they didn't make their own reputation but their actions and their words and their love and their submission to others and the power of God in their life made their own reputation praise God he made himself of no reputation remember jesus said I don't take the witness of man he said I let God witness for me amen and took upon in the form of a servant so he was in the form of God and when he's in the form of God he became a servant like we said last week and was made in the likeness of men so if we should be anything we should be servants so our sisters we need to serve our children sisters we need to serve our husbands right brothers we need to serve our wives we'll get to that Lord winning in a few minutes here that's very rare for a husband to serve his wife other than just going to work right and making a paycheck and maybe driving the family vehicle there's there's more to a man serving than just that mercy and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of his cross so Jesus's service made him a servant and he served God's purpose for his life not his own he had rights to do other things hid rights as a man but he he forsook those rights in order to save us in order to make our lives worth living and we'll get to that that's what a man should do he should serve his family to make his wife's life better and his children's life better and doing that then he accomplishes God's will for his life as a servant so that's a great example on Christ modeled submission he obeyed what the father said he served us and he met our needs before he met his own desires because he didn't want to die that way he didn't want to go to the cross you don't have to do that but he humbled himself and took the pain of the cross in order to lift us up praise God amen okay that's Ephesians 5:22 and 23 for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church he's the savior of the body so our sisters remember that God give you that man to lead you and your family verse 24 therefore as Christ I'm sure therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husband's in everything so as long as the husband's asking you do something within your power that's right in godly our sisters must obey that and I'll say like this as long as God's Word through the fivefold ministry ask every member of Bride of Christ fellowship to obey God's Word they should do it if not they're being dishonorable right they're being disobedient if the Word of God has preached to us we can't forget it like James 1 says we can't deceive our own selves and forget what the God the Word of God was preached and what was said through the preacher if we do that we're being we're being a disrespectful wife to Christ we must obey the word and everything and how do you do that through love love keeps all the commandments all God's lost within in one word love praise God and love of course flows from the soul right because you have the love of God shut in your hearts right by the Holy Ghost amen so when we live from our souls and we bring our minds as an subjection to our souls then we can love God God the right way then we can't obey the Word of God then we will keep God's commandments amen so just because we're not married or don't have children doesn't mean these things don't apply to us they certainly do apply to us in everything the Bible said be subject and obey in everything verse 25 now we get to our our men our leaders who should be godly leaders verse 25 I remember the men in the Roman and Ephesians society they had little to no duties to their wives they didn't have to be true to them they didn't have to treat them nice they could disrespect them hit them speak any way they want but now Paul is anointed by the Holy Spirit to turn their society upside down and there's a very small flock that received a praise God remember within I think 160 years or 260 years the whole city was wiped out because they didn't the the whole city didn't repent so God took the can away from Ephesus and the city was destroyed but no doubt there was a few Holy Ghost filled curse in the least well praise God they had the baptism of the Holy Ghost that lived the right kind of life so verse 25 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for saints this was earth-shattering kind of like today it's earth-shattering when a husband may be asked to maybe sweep sweep with the sweeper dear hubby could you sweep with the sweeper or as a pastor all brothers could you help out at home and help your help sweep the floor for your wives if you got a chance brothers could you help with some laundry brothers from the pastor could you help with the dishes at home could you help change the diaper brothers so for some brothers it's earth-shattering how do I know because I've talked to some about that they've never changed a diaper they've never helped with dishes they've never helped clean up and so some of these some of these ways to show love may be earth-shattering to some brothers remember Jesus Christ said this the greatest among you is the servant the one who can submit themselves am i submitting yourself you make others needs more important and you lift up others you help them and as we said not not just by going to to work and making a paycheck sinners can do that any sinner man can go I know lots of sinners from my childhood that men that went to work and paid bills or Catholic Methodist Presbyterian you have treat their wives awful any sinner can go to work and do that but brothers we got to find a greater way to love our wives we have to find more ways to do it so Paul says the way to do this is to give yourself for your wife so give your free time up to help out your wife to show love to your wife now church we're not in a competition to be the greatest Christian but I also want to say this we don't want to be the least I don't want to be the if I don't want to be the least I don't want there to be a question of people are questioning my devotion or questioning my love I don't want my wife to question my love for her I don't want my children to question my love for them I don't want to be the least father or the least faithful husband or the least loving husband I want to be the best I can be by God's grace so while we're not competing we also know Paul says lay aside sin and run the race the best you can praise God like you're the only one that could be a real loving husband like you'd be the only one that could be a real loving father love is the highest Act and Jesus of love of course is the highest greatest act of love love gives itself away love gives of its free time love gives up its energy when it feels like it doesn't have any we know first Corinthians 13 lists 16 attributes of love it suffers long thinks no evil and all the other attributes now why does Jesus love us like this verse 26 and he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word so see Christ help cleanse the church so the husband must help his wife live closer to God by loving her and not just physical love that won't that won't do it it takes more than that and he does it by sanctifying himself so the only way a husband is really going to love his wife is first get the Friends of Jesus Christ and gets sanctified because jesus said in john 17 19 he said he said the way I'm gonna sanctify my disciples is by sanctifying myself that's why that morning routine video I just put out was so important for all Christians I believe wise version Christians now because first you got to get yourself sanctified by Jesus Christ and then you'll be so full of love that you'll be able to help sanctify and cleanse your family and the way you do that is by loving them with the love of Christ let me just say a few things that I do brothers and I'm gonna challenge you to do it for my wife so for my wife I try to get up early in the morning so I get all my study time done in the morning and so that way when I get home from work I can help wash dishes I can take the baby I can somehow give my wife some help I'll fix the sweeper I was gonna you know we have such long hair again I gotta clean the sweeper roller out at least once a week so I do that job I'll take out the trash I'll do all kinds of different jobs to try to help out my wife also once a week I'll take her out on a two-hour date and our older children of course on the babysitter's I give her that time away with with her and I just the talk reconnect talk about things that we need to talk about and then every Saturday even during the school year when I'm working I trying to take my children on a daddy date for three sometimes four sometimes five or more hours just to give her peace and quiet where she can do what she needs to do and then that time she gets to of course hear sermons do her her work and do the things that she needs to do sometimes take a nap so of course there's other things that I do but these are just some simple examples of ways I can give myself so if I can sanctify myself and live close to God in the morning then I can devote the rest of the time in the evening to try to help my wife and my children get closer to God remember Jesus gave himself because he loved that's Galatians 2:20 I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live not yet i but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me praise God so brothers what I'm saying is that if we really love Christ will give our free time a way to help our lives to help our children so because Christ loved he gave and brothers because we love our wives will give of our time will give more of our energy to lift her up to raise her up to help show her love in ways she may have not felt it very much before seeing that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word so Christ washes his bride with his word so so does a man when he pours out real divine love upon his wife sacrificial love and he sacrifices his own self for his wife it's like pouring the waters of God's Word upon her and it washes her and it refreshes her when he serves his wife verse 27 that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing that should be holy and without blemish verse 28 so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself verse 29 for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourishes and cherishes it even as the Lord the church might a lot of brothers that you know they treat their flesh real good know they'll take their flesh out too every day that's spending a lot of extra money right they'll go out to eat every day just because this I work hard I'm gonna treat myself well but really it's healthier to you know pack a lunch right unless you unless you really choose to eat healthy foods are healthy restaurants but see men will buy themselves the best boots because they're standing on their feet all day by themselves the warmest jackets because they're out there working in the cold weather the best tools will spend all this money and do so though so sleep extra right well just like they treat themselves and take care of their own selves they should apply that same love to their wives and see how they could love their wives better to give her the best they can give her so the best of their attention the best of their their service and of course you have the best of the food and the best of the clothes and the best they can do any man that really loves God will try to do that for his wife and his children because he loves his wife and children as Christ loves the church verse 29 for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourishes it and cherishes it even as the Lord the church verse 30 we were members of his body of his flesh and of his bones see Paul gives two symbols for how men should love their wives as Christ loved the church and as his own body so it's not very hard for a man to figure out how how should I love my wife look at how Christ loved his disciples loved the church and the Holy Ghost all these things but then also watch how a man treats his body really well so then he should know that because he knows how he treats his own body watch the receipts see how you spend your money on yourself right so a man has two very easy references to look at how I'm supposed to love my wife Christ loving the church and how I love my own body so how many husbands live in a way to make life better for their wives and I'm just not talking about not just financially but in helping with the children and helping take off the pressure right and helping with the home chores we all know the story brother branham putting on an apron to help out his wife when the children were crying not sure how many times he did that that's a great example of him submitting himself see he took on a role that didn't belong to him dishwashing wasn't under the man's job description right but yet brother branham humbled himself at least at one time and he put on the apron and he washed dishes and so that's where we'll see Christian men act today they'll take upon a role that nothing necessarily doesn't belong to them but they'll humble themselves in order to serve their wives and serve their children and that's loving their families as Christ loved the church why do we do this why brothers do you do this because your wife is part of you that's what verse 30 says we're members of the christ body as flesh and bones right just as Eve was a part of Adam brothers we got a look at our wives that way she is a part of me how could I mistreat my own body how could I mistreat my own reign but it would be evil for me to do that and so we have to look in ourselves and our wives and our children in that very same way verse 31 Paul gives his authority for this teaching for this cause shall a man leave his wife and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh now the word joined here is beautiful as the same meaning as the Hebrew word cleave in I believe us Genesis chapter 1 joy means to glue upon it means to join oneself too closely to cleave to or to stick to so brothers that's how our that's how our lives are supposed to look we're supposed to be so attached to our wives that is we're like glued to them right we're so dedicated to our families that we're like glued to our families think about how powerful glue is I was telling my families I have a gold crown on my first molar on the bottom right-hand side I got this crowd it's a beautiful golden crown because I had such a awful cavity at a top almost half of my first molar and when they place this crown on there they put cement on there and that cement has held through 20 years of chewing I've chewed a lot of hard things right like almonds and all kinds of things all kinds of crazy candies well yet that cement that glue has held if the glues never let up and failed to attach to the bottom part of my tooth and brothers what a great lesson that is for us if natural cement can stay that attached to a molar to a gold crown what about the gold in your heart the time-tested faith right the gold a time-tested character praise God how much more should that faith be connect our our lives brothers our desires to serve our wives and how we should care and love for them we are our love should be glued upon them right it should be connected to them how can I help my wife how can I serve my wife a lot of people want to know how can I get closer to Christ what can I do for the Lord brothers serve your wives that's find a way to help her out praise God find a way to help your children that's a way you can serve Jesus Christ praise God by doing that you may find your gift of the spirit might be wisdom might be prayer might be healing right you might find it as you serve your family and I want mine just for the record I want my gold crown to stay there I want that glue to stick raise God and that's what God wants God wants our commitment brothers to stick to our wives not to somebody else's wife not to somebody else's children but to our wives and our children that's real love and then Paul says in verse 32 this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church now this word mystery in the Greek means it's only to the initiated and not to ordinary mortals it says so this mystery of how a man should give himself to help out his wife it's not revealed to average mortals it's to a special class right like Jesus said these mysteries they're not given to them I said they're given unto you unto you the mysteries of God have been made known praise God so there are they're given to a special class of people the foreknown right the predestinated the elected and how do you know it Paul said make your calling election sure praise God if you're so elected if you're so predestinated then live it brothers serve your wives serve your children it's a great mystery it's not obvious to the understanding this was a huge mystery to the Ephesians right this was huge mystery to the Romans what do you mean they would say well I have a line I have an impulse for intimacy I'll just go to the prostitute I've got to satisfy that impulse and Paul saying no the power of the crowd the power of the Cross will make you die to that because that's that's that's lust that's a perversion but the Holy Spirit will give you real love to be devoted to your your wife and cast down that passion cast down that temptation because our weapons are mighty through the pulling down of those strongholds praise God amen thank the Lord so see it was a great thing it wasn't obvious to these Ephesians I'll say this it's not obvious to very many message men so-called message men it's not very obvious to them because they don't even know when they get home they don't even know how to serve their families they think it's all this is my time or this is my your time should be wrapped up and being glued to your wife being glued to your children helping them out the best you can by God's grace praise God it's a great mystery but it's concerning Christ in the church and let me go back to the singles that don't have children you should be so glued to Christ that whatever Christ says you do that in your home right so our signals in their homes then I'm going there to keep them accountable other than the Holy Spirit if they're born again they should be so in two with the voice of the Holy Spirit that they should be glued to the will of the Heavenly Father right there in their homes and then through that they'll find a ministry right to serve others to serve God to serve others God will lead and guide them on how to do that there's my hour so let me let me bring this on mobile yeah I'm almost done here so let's close with verse 33 verse 33 is this summary here nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love him love his wife even his isms as himself so Paul closes us and he says how can I finish this this passage on marriage he said men love your wives as yourself praise God this is an age where they didn't they the men didn't love their wives Ephesians were taught not to love I thought that was that was wimpy that wasn't very manly to be faithful to one woman I wasn't very manly we have Paul says this is what the Spirit of Christ is teaching this is real love this is real manhood praise God he said and let the wife see that she reverence her husband now love for the men is agapo love that's the greek word it means to love dearly to be fun brothers we should be fond of our wives we should think highly of them we should love them dearly we should be well pleased so that's what that gob a means well pleased contented with we should be very content thank God for my wife she's a jewel my crown right she's she's my crown amen she's very valuable as the scripture says her price is far above rubies of millions of dollars and brothers let me say this in closing if you're not sure how to love your wife better then just ask her in humility maybe just say honey wants three things or what's one or two things I can do because maybe she'll give you a list that's so long you won't be able to handle it write me maybe me too well let's just ask is there one or two things I can do to show more love that I could help you out and show more love to you and then sisters let the wife see that she reverence her husband this is the word from a hoe which is the word to be struck with fear to be seized with the Lord no of course we know that's not the right word right definition to use for the word it's in this word to reverence or venerate that means really look up to an admirer to treat with deference or reverential obedience so our sisters in love should look at their husbands and instantly be ready to receive orders right just like the man should be ready honey how can I help you how can i how can I love you I want to be glued to you how can I help you just as a love of God you make a man be quick to think how can I serve you the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit should help our sisters think what can i what can I do to obey you husband that same type of attitude so sisters if you're not sure how you could respect your husband's more you're the same thing humble yourselves in humility ask and say what's one or two more ways I could make you feel more respected or I could obey you in certain areas let's have our musicians come I told you I was closing some phrasing are just some lesson order my soul O my soul worship his holy name saying such as bow our heads I hope that was a blessing to you I hope that you can see even if you're married or not this scripture passage is so important because all of us want to be a part of the spiritual marriage all of us want to be glued to Christ if we're truly honest with ourselves praise God in hallelujah so let's have a word of Prayer Saints Heavenly Father we love you today - we thank you for your mercy we thank you for this word [Music] what a culture shocked all of your profit brought to the people or to I believe the Holy Spirit does the same thing in the message today some of our dear brothers have been married and maybe they've never been taught Lord God what real love is but it's sacrificial real love wants to be a servant to help lift up the weaker help make the weak strong it wants to be glued wants to be close in connection to their life and their children of our brothers in Jesus Christ lovely name may help them Lord God in this message strengthen their marriages in their love may they truly love with the agapo love of God and they think fondling and highly and be contented with their lives show great dear love and devotion to their wives praise God thank you know when our sisters love their husbands respect them obey them be ready to obey quick to honor them and listen maybe such a mutual love or that our marriages will show the world the true mystery the revelation of the mystery of Christ the church amen thank you it's this revelation of the mystery is not for the common person it's for those that are instituted that are taught deeply in the Word of God that love God have dug down as we heard on Sunday dug down deep in their hearts and built their their house on the rock of Christ word it's for the experience it's been it's with a serious Christian more gonna help our
