morning at church in Akron and then Lord willing we'll have a 4:00 p.m. Bible study service livestream just like tonight by the grace of Lord also yeah one more update there this morning I finished that the next YouTube video it's called not every word William random said was thus saith the Lord yet he's a true prophet so it's already number one out of the last the last two years so within the first eight or ten hours so thank the Lord for that I've heard back from four or five people already about what a blessing it was so that's the pattern we do it we try to preach it first to you and then take it to YouTube land so thankful for that if anyone's interested up I'll probably share it anyway I'll probably text it to you as a blessing there by the grace of God so I can't think of any other announcements by the grace of God so let's sing one more song here and we'll get right into the Word of God let's sing the highest praise and then we'll get right no word of God here tonight [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Laughter] [Music] let's say praise the Lord praise say thank you Jesus thank you Jesus glory let's stand take our Bibles here tonight by God's grace Lord willing when I look at part two of the Bible covenants tonight we're in a star at the third feminine so let's go to Genesis chapter verse 20 praise the Lord Genesis 8 verse 20 [Music] might do some reading Genesis 820 of course this is right after the flood let's notice here verse 20 by God's grace we read 20 21 22 out of the memory we're so sorry about that interior so just for times sake let's just read verse 20 Genesis 8:21 I'll read it together in our homes we're gonna hear it together out loud on three one two three and Noah builded an altar unto the Lord and took of every clean beast and of every clean foul and offering burnt offerings on the altar praise God if you would just keep your spot there let's go to Romans chapter 12 for our memory verse 20 is 12:1 and 2 so let's read this on three by God's grace one two three I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God let's have one more word of Prayer ask the Lord to minister if you have a need on your heart just make it known at the Lord right there in your home nobody father we love you again we thank you Lord for your mercy it's so good to sing to you we give you all the worship all the praise thank you for forgiving us the unworthy ones Lord you're so worthy your son was the only one worthy to take the book and loosed the seals and now we have a new Bible thank you Lord that these topics and these covenants Lord come open in a way that we've never seen it before Lord God just blessed now to our hearts and our minds Lord that help us to remember your promises even today how their unfailing we love you Lord bless us now in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen god bless you maybe see this praise guy now we'll go back to Genesis 8 verse 20 by God's grace now here we're on the the third covenant out of eight now that's what I believe as far as the scripture it seems like New Jerusalem is the eighth day and so it seems like the New Jerusalem will be the eighth covenant we start with Eden's covenant conditional then we went to the Adam covenant and then Lord willing Sunday nerves are you last Sunday night we finished with Noah's covenant I'm sorry now we just got through to last week right yeah we just got through the part me thinking about tonight here we got through the eating covenant and the Adam covenant on Sunday night praise God tonight we're on the third one by God's grace or on Noah's covenant now this is a long covenant so I'm not going to read all this but it starts at Genesis 8:20 and goes all the way to 9 17 so let's just keep reading here at the beginning let's go to Genesis 8:21 now and the Lord smelled a sweet savour and the Lord said in his heart I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth neither will I again smite anymore every living thing as I have done while the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest and cold and he and some winter and day and night shall not cease now let's go to chapter 9 I want to just go to verse 15 actually you know what why don't we go to 12 because it mentions it there I like how verse 12 shows God's specific words a quote from the Lord about the word covenant verse 12 and God said this is the token of the Covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for perpetual generations I do set my bow in the cloud and it shall be a token of a covenant between me and the earth praise God I'm gonna preach from my notes I was highlighting and stunning on those a little bit here tonight by God's grace so now we're on the third covenant it's the Noah covenant praise the Lord now this covenant came into effect about almost 2,000 years after the Adam covenant technically I think by Bible chronology it's about one thousand seven hundred years since Adam's covenant went into effect and notice again it's the Lord initiating this covenant remember that the word covenant means agreement or league and remember how that's different from dispensation at least with Paul's dispensation Paul's dispensation was a stewardship or one job or assignment within the New Covenant and so here we have God establishing a covenant in agreement with man and God makes these gracious gracious promises now notice it's again established after Noah offers a sacrifice right so here again we have a covenant where there's blood blood had to be shed so just like in the previous covenant that Adam covenant God came down and he tore apart lambs and made lamb coat skins and he clothed Adam and Eve and as they walked the skin slapped against their legs but God called out he said I'm gonna kick you out he said but imma let you back in praise God and that be through the the seed of the woman which was Mary bringing forth the Christ child the Lord Jesus Christ amen and that blood brings us back into fellowship with God because God's Spirit is now made available in the soul of man and now you and I get to partake of the tree of life praise God amen one day that life will be in our mortal body it'll swallow up our mortal body in other words and we'll have a glorified body praise God but right now jesus said I am the bread of life we'll get to that just a moment but he's the Tree of Life praise God and so here we see blood being shed again and beasts being torn apart and then God looks down from heaven no one looks up and God looks down and said I'm gonna now make another covenant I'm gonna make another League agreement with mankind right after Noah leaves the ark and now this time the lord's covenant is with man but also with all living things so this is a unique covenant here in one sense it's with man and animals he promises to never curse the ground again nor smite every living thing through a flood and we thank the Lord for that praise God but one thing we keep in mind the 2nd Peter 3:10 then why don't you get that for us because in 2nd Peter 3:10 we know God is gonna smite all living things with fire is that right so you says here in Genesis he said I'm never gonna kill in the same way or smite the earth or judge the earth with water but we know the next time is going to be fire so Lydia can you read 2nd Peter 3:10 but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements that then shown that melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up thank you so the earth and all the elements will be burnt up so we know God is going to do this just in a different way and that he's gonna do it for the same purpose because man was so evil man was so selfish that he turned down God's mark the baptism of the holy ghost a freak a freak of inant right a free pass to heaven right a free token to the rapture to escape the Great Tribulation but most of men are so foolish they reject it so God has to pour out wrath because only their hearts meditate on evil all the time continually so evil that they take the mark of the beast they turn down God's mark and they would rather worship a man than worship the god man the Lord Jesus Christ a fallible man they'd rather worship a Satan film man than a God filled man but we worship the God filled man the Lord Jesus Christ praise God because Christ is the image of the invisible God praise God amen now let's go through some of the promises now it's the first thing God promises in this covenant is he after you know promising he'll never destroy the earth again by water the next thing he reaffirms the be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth so God said that in the first eating covenant and now he reaffirms it after all mankind is destroyed he says remember he said be fruitful multiply replenish the earth also next he he says animals will continue to fear and dread mankind so man's dominion over all living things will continue what's interesting now is God allows a new diet he allows mankind to eat meat but they must abstain from the blood because the life is in the blood beforehand man was vegetarians man and animal were vegetarians but now God allows us and it's very interesting next God allows capital punishment to be carried out in within the human government so before we know you know in the Garden of Eden or after the Garden of Eden rather with Cain and Abel Cain slew Abel but God did not kill Cain God let him go and he was a wanderer and a vagabond all the days of his life with a mark upon him but now after the flood after the judgment God allows capital punishment in Genesis 9:6 amount I can read that Genesis 9:6 thank you so now God kind of Institute's this I for an eye principle now Noah quote we know of course he you know say that specifically that in the Mosaic Covenant which Lord willing we'll get to here tonight if God's willing but yeah also put it here now I want everyone to understand although God instituted this we know that we must do it in the fear of the Lord okay now what I mean by that is if we're to if they were to carry out capital punishment it is done through much discretion so although it's allowed God is still very merciful so for example Moses killed a man right and then Noah of course was before way before Moses and yet God did not suffer him to be killed although he murdered a man so God was merciful and then David indirectly killed Uriah and yet God had mercy on David so we understand that although God allowed this it was used with great discretion and great fear of the Lord now to conclude this covenant it's again so with such a beautiful thought God gives the first token and it's the first time the word token is used in the Bible amen because the token means a sign praise God a sign there's a sign for the Covenant and this of course is the seven colored rainbow the bow will be in the clouds and then God will remember his covenant with man and all living things to never destroy the earth again through a flood now remember this is a beautiful symbol here the rainbow and so member I preach us a few years ago but on earth we only see half of a rainbow right we receive maybe a little over more than a half but God truly loves the rainbow the world has perverted it of course through the homosexual and LGBT movement and so forth it's been perverted but this is God's covenant this is God's symbol and God thinks so much of it that when revelation is open we see there's a bow but it's not just half way around but it's all around the throne of God and that tells us that the half has not yet been told about the gracious covenants of God amen so what a blessing here only we only know half praise God probably less than that but the point is God will review all the great blessings of promises and protections of his covenants to us in glory praise the Lord so I want to say this now as we close this covenant all the commands and conditions of Noah's covenant remain to this day but it seems that it ends at the eternal covenant when the eternal covenant begins because there's no more death so see God won't have to prove it anymore of course there'll be no capital punishment there we know eating probably no eating of animals anymore imagine so it seems like this covenant lasts a great long time praise God alright next we have our fourth covenant the fourth covenant is the Abrahamic or Abraham's covenant so it's found in a couple scriptures Genesis 12 liddie if you go there Malachi Genesis 17 9 so Genesis 12:1 Lydia and Malachi Genesis 17 9 so after a long period between Adams covenant to Noah there's a rather shorter one from Noah to Abraham and kind of get the background remember after Noah what major event took place the Tower of Babel so even after God graciously gives humanity another chance they rebelled again man still shows every imagination of his heart is wicked and he wants to try to make his own way to heaven they're still doing that today right in the modern day tower Babel we'd say the Roman Catholic Church the mother harlot and all her daughters not just the one just the mother but the daughters as well when they make a man-made way to heaven anything that's outside of the blood of Jesus Christ thank God for the blood of Jesus Christ that's why we're saying we're saved by grace through faith not of works lest any man should boast praise God but 400 years pass and God sees them again all mankind gathers the one place and they try to they try to just force their way to heaven or discover their way to heaven and God said they would have done it that's how smart they were my so God sends angels down he shuts him down he changes their language and creates Babel confusion and out of this God said I need to make a new covenant then all these men come against me and I've got to do something new praise God and so God chooses one man praise God out of all the world God chooses one mass and I'm gonna start a new covenant with this man his name's Abram praise God so then it can you read verses 1 through 3 in Genesis 12 you have the out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that I will show thee and I will make of thee a great nation I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that curse thean curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed amen thank you now by God's grace we saw five blessings did you notice I think there's five blessings in this command he's gonna make a great nation of Abraham seed 1 he's gonna make his name great which it is right with the three major religions Christianity Judaism and the Muslim faith all make claim to Abraham that's over I think that's over about 3 billion people on this earth number 3 God promises I bless all those who bless you Abram number 4 I'll curse all those who curse you and number 5 I will make a view of blessing to all the families on the earth so through you every family on the earth would be blessed by what I promised that's how much God thought of Abraham or Abram you had such fate remember he's the father of faith the father of Revelation so Abraham had a revelation right faith is the evidence of things not seen so revelation is your evidence God has unveiled some one of his promises to you and that is your evidence your hope or your assurance your trust that what God revealed to you is his word and it's going to come to pass he's the father of that and praise God we're part of his seed spiritually today amen don't know why we don't have any proof maybe you say we'll go in the rapture or have any proof to say we're wise virgins or anything like that but we have the revelation of it by the baptism of the Holy Spirit of the same spirit that was in Christ doing the same works and living the same life in our life today that's our evidence faith praise God amen thank the Lord hallelujah so women have Malachi read Genesis 17 9 to 14 yes please and God said unto Abraham I should have keep my covenant therefore thou and they seed after thee in their generations this is my covenant which you shall keep between me and you and thy seed after you every man shot on you shall be circumcised then you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin it should be it's opened up with evident tricks me and you and he that has eight days old shall be circumcised among you every man child in your generations he then is born in the house or bought with money of any stranger which is not as I see he then is born in my house and he that has bought with my money must not be circumcised and my covenant shall be in your flesh for everlasting covenant and the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that soul should be fought for his people he had broken my covenant thank you I'm Alcott the token which we'll get to in a moment but before we get to there once again God in his beautiful design he confirms his covenant with Abram through a blood sacrifice in Genesis 15 now we're not going to go through read that all of it but we know Abraham brought many of these sacrifices and then he slew him and remember what happened remember how the birds came down and tried to take away the sacrifice and number Abram had to shoo him away and brother man thought that that was a type of Abraham casting out Devils right because usually groups of birds represent evil spirits and so then a beautiful thing happens God puts Abram to sleep and then the Holy Spirit like a furnace like a light goes between the sacrifices and usually in a covenant which I don't have the scripture about he'd look it up I think it's in Jeremiah usually God said when you make a covenant both men stand between the pieces of the animal and they make a oath saying that if we don't keep it let if I don't keep my end of the bargain if I don't keep my covenant let me be as this beast let me be torn apart but see when God did it with Abraham he said Abraham down I said Abraham your strength is not going to be able to keep this covenant right Abraham strength couldn't do it God was God was showing that Abraham you can't keep a covenant and this one I'm instituting and my word it's my power it's my Holy Spirit's my light that's going to keep this covenant praise God amen that's so beautiful praise the Lord God has to put him asleep and said I'm the one it's my power that will keep the Covenant praise God because we know Abraham lied he fell short of the glory of God Abraham sinned at times right he wasn't a perfect man but God wasn't looking at his mistakes God was looking at his faith praise God God forgave him all the sins amen praise God so again blood is connected with the Covenant praise God it's like with Adam's Noah's and now Abraham's there's always blood shed and a covenant except for the first and the last as we said the eating covenant and then the eternal covenant there be no bloodshed at those as far as we understand by the grace of the Lord now even after Abraham's death memory the Abraham brother he lived 175 years even after that we're not going to read it but in Genesis 26 and Genesis 28 God is so faithful to Abraham's seed that he comes to Abraham's son Isaac and grandson Jacob and he reaffirms the Covenant that he gave Abram back in Genesis 15 it's beautiful to see it but we're not going to go there to read it just for times sake I want you to nod to notice that God is now focusing on one group of people to make a great nation through his holiness because mankind in total defiance defied is his law at the Tower of Babel he defied his word they defied his way to heaven so because all of humanity came against God God said I'm gonna start with one praise God just like he did with no I'm gonna start with one family there's one family that found grace and the side Lord in church let our families be the families that find grace in this wicked hour this Laodicean lukewarm how're that our families be the ones that are found faithful that have a fire for God and love for God a diligence for God may God granted that we can be faithful families that find grace in the sight of the Lord praise God amen thank the Lord now through this covenant God does a major thing God creates two groups of people so before this there was only the human race right but now God said I'm gonna make a seed out of Abraham so now he makes the Abrahamic seed which we know later turns into Israel or Judah right Abraham Isaac Jacob Jacob had a name change to Israel and the people because he had 12 sons became known as the children of Israel and later they became known as Jews because the center of Israel was Judah right and so they called him Jews which was short for Judah the tribe of Judah we know Judah was just one try but they took that name because Jerusalem there was the capital of Israel they called it the people of Judah all right now so God focuses on one family praise God the the Abrahamic family which later becomes the Jewish family praise God now everyone else all their nations are called Gentiles now remember God promised to bless all those but he wasn't specifically dealing with them he was specifically dealing with Abraham's seed praise God but as long as the Gentiles bless Abraham God would bless them if they cursed Abraham they'd be cursed now just like the Noah covenant God assigns a token for Abraham's covenant this time it's not in nature which all men can see it's actually in man's body which men don't see very often right unless it's a personal situation right so now it's it's a covenant in secret and God calls it an everlasting covenant in their flesh which is male circumcision now know this program brother Adam catches this numerous times on the tapes he said notice the Bible said everlasting covenant and not eternal because an eternal will never have an end right so God causes an everlasting because everlasting usually means just a very long time it's not the same as eternal which means never had the beginning never had an ending so Malachi read that tonight he said I'm gonna give you an everlasting covenant the male circumcision now I want to just stop and make this obvious point to most people but Abraham's covenant has suture supernaturally shaped and transformed human history remember in Genesis 41 I'll just give a few examples Egypt was going to suffer an awful famine right that whole part the whole part of the world was gonna suffer an awful famine and death but God spared Egypt because they blessed Joseph right so because one of the most wicked idolatrous nations which later got judged right by Pharaoh through Pharaoh's disbelief God spared Egypt God blessed Egypt with seven years of plenty and then kept them through Joseph God blessed Egypt through Joseph through Abraham seed all those that bless you bless all those that curse you I'll curse praise God and we know Israel or Egypt has fallen greatly because they started cursing right Israel and Moses and that's why there was the Exodus so see we can easily see how Abraham's seed is transformed so whatever whoever Israel went that's where the blessings of God flowed from another example was under Moses Joshua David and then Solomon Solomon was we called the Golden Age of Israel right so much prosperity so much blessings where everybody was under Solomon right at the end of David's life everybody was under David right he had all the nations they're under under him and paying him taxes right and so see everyone that blessed Israel was blessed think about Moses and Joshua all the nations they destroyed the Moabites the Hittites amirite whoever blessed that most blessed whoever came against them was cursed and so all history follows this same pattern and even today we know the United States became the world's superpower because of its judeo-christian foundation and its initial adherence to God's laws that's why America has become we'd say the beast out of the land right from Revelation chapter 13 the Constitution and the Bill of Rights are heavily influenced by the Torah and Paul's epistles America's prosperity has flowed over into every other nation in fact in the 1800s a man from Europe came over to United States and went across the country and went back to Europe and wrote a book and called it America's exceptionalism he said there was something exceptional about America they're not the biggest country they don't have the most people in their country but their prosperity is unparalleled so for the for the number of people their fruitfulness is unmatched and he called it American exceptionalism why was that because America started with prayer fasting honoring God freedom of religion and they took upon themselves the spiritual seed of Abraham praise God they were the spiritual seed of Abraham and that tiny little boat coming across the ocean right God protecting his seed hallelujah thank the Lord and then now is transform the entire globe has transformed the entire world through Abraham's seed now going back to the nation of Israel we know they became identified nation in 1948 they have experienced amazing prosperity and innovation since they got back in their land it is a known fact I use a a reference in the book here or willing when it comes out Israel is one of the world's leaders in the number of patents research achievements entrepreneurship and innovation in the entire world again per person or per per population it's one of the greatest and most prosperous most fruitful nations in all the world I think is top three in the world so it's so extraordinary why is that because they're Abraham's seed and when they obey God God blesses them and then whoever blesses them God blesses them in return when I threw out this about America although other nations you know are prosperous like we'd say like China and other places like that you know the United Kingdom and everything there is no country like the United States of America people sit from all around the world say that because no country experiences the level of freedom and prosperity that Americans have Chinese can be very prosperous English can be very prosperous but they don't have the freedoms that we have because our freedoms come from God's word come from the Torah come from the New Testament some of them come from Jesus's words praise God and I've had a friend I have a friend in denomination his name's Dan he's been to over 20 different countries around the world and he just pleased with people on Facebook and everyone he comes in contact to he said don't let socialism come in this country he said I've been to the socialist countries I've been to all these countries he said there's no place like America why is that it's because the blessings of Abraham upon this nation praise God because God keeps his covenant aren't you glad God keeps his covenant promise to us Abraham seat praise God I wanted to stop and make a point here that as far as my my book I remember I'm preaching chapter two right now of the next book if the Lord is willing now a chapter 3 will deal specifically on the mystery of God graciously opening the eight Abrahamic covenant to the Gentiles okay so I'll devote that whole chapter to that how it was a natural seed and then it became a spiritual seed so Israel is Abraham's natural seed her offspring but our faith in Jesus Christ makes us the spiritual seed and that's in Galatians three seven I'll read it know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of Abraham so because Abraham's true seed is actually spiritual now the circumcision or token is now spiritual as well praise God amen Paul cause at the inward circumcision of the heart amen and of course he means soul as well in Romans 229 I wanted to stop and make a point here I found a real good quote and for all of our friends that love quotes I know you do praise God so I want to read a quote I'm a quote lover and I know you are too because we take all those quotes back to the Word of God let me read this quote we hear now programs preaching the last sermon of nineteen sixty it's called Revelation chapter 4 part 1 he's closings this is on a New Year's night and he's praying and doing an altar call and asking people to raise their hands if they want to accept Christ he says this he says our heavenly father has this New Year's Eve just about two hours now and it'll be over there'll be a new year what we have done this year we have did many things I've done I'm ashamed of myself I repent of those Lord and there's a lot of things that I've done that many of my brethren didn't understand many of the brothers out in the fields don't understand and why did them but father I did them because I was led to do them I pray father that you will never let me be ashamed of that leading praise God amen turn to you and I we never would be shamed of the way God leads us we'll know it's God leading cuz it'll be more of the Word of God that were supposed to fulfill [Music] he said but leave me on Lord to continue to do as I am led to do help me God because I seek sincerely to know your will that I might do it to bring no no notice he breaks into this vision or dream I can't find which one it was but notice he says he's seeking to know God's will that I might do it to bring as you show me many years ago when I left this church so when brother Branham went he left pastoring round tabernacle and went on his mission healing and missionary campaigns he had a vision he said to bring the bread of life to the peoples of the world now watch this watch this because this is important for me and I know for you too so brother man I had a vision when he left a tabernacle he was to bring the bread of God to the people of the world look what he says when I saw that great mountain of bread oh brother hos I hope you're saying Amen right now when I saw that great mountain of bread and listen white robe Saints coming from all over the earth to eat this bread of life amen praise God hallelujah now why is that so important Church because he says Oh God let me Oh God let me never fail to feed the people on the bread of life because notice people from all around the world are coming to brother Brent of the north they have white robes on which means they have eternal life they're coming to him to feed on a mountain of bread now the reason I bring that up is because I'm preaching from the book I'm writing now which I feel inspired by the Holy Spirit to write it and there's 12 chapters and those twelve represe there's twelve Bible mysteries and those twelve represent the twelve loaves of shewbread praise God in the Holy Place phrase what are they they're a mountain bread actually two mountains of bread praise God see it's beautiful in church this is what God did in brother man's ministry he had a Leibrandt amber NACO to preach all the revelations of God right of course after the seals he took those revelations and preached him out as well so he had to go and preach you know all the mysteries that were preaching that we've been preaching the mysteries of the kingdom of God the mystery of the rapture the mystery of God's will oh my here the mystery of the Jew and Gentile praise God here the mystery of Israel's blindness all these mysteries and you had to go preach and deliver God's bread the mysteries of God and that ties in perfectly with Revelation chapter 10 where John eats the book and he goes and prophesied to every nation there they are there they are everybody feeding on the bread of God praise God eating the book eating the bread of God thank you lord so I never found that quote I think til last week so I know Jose I know you love that one brother what a blessing praise God so brother Aaron continues praying in this sermon he said bless these hungry souls in here that raised their hands just now they're seeking for more of life I pray that you'll fill them with the Holy Ghost Lord each of them each one of them granite Lord God give them blessings help our brethren everywhere and bless our ministry brothers it's fixing to come up again now in a few moments others will be speaking we pray that they will give out the bread of life to us tonight father as we'll listen closely and reverently to hear the voice granite amen wow I didn't catch it you catch it but a man just said to hear God's voice so see brother man was saying I'm not the only voice of God now he was the main voice as a prophet and the church a messenger but he also said God is going to speak through these other people and we're gonna hear the voice tonight amen because there's one voice the voice of the Holy Spirit praise God amen and notice they're gonna be feeding people bread to Ivy that's what we're doing tonight we're feeding God's people the bread amen the bread of life hallelujah thank the Lord alright hope you like that one that's beautiful beautiful quote there and I didn't I didn't even realize that one must have forgot that vision or that dream whatever it was brother man said the people will be coming from all over the world to eat the bread of God the eternal life of God's bread from Bible thank the Lord praise God good now got about twenty minutes to get my hour here so we'll see how we go now let's get back here this Abrahamic covenant all the conditions and commands from this covenant to today now how many believe this is a great cover now I would say Amen I mean tremendous through those five tremendous blessings everything he touched is turned to gold basically everything a wreck anyone that loves Abraham they're gonna be blessed but as great as this is this covenant never solves anything with Abraham sin problem it's still animal blood sacrifice right it doesn't solve that problem because the Bible said there was still a problem they would sacrifice but their conscience when they would leave their conscience was would stay to file her advice could never cleanse their conscience to say I am really forgiving God really done ah my sins are put away there there underneath the blood also Calvary praise God as far away as darkness is from Donna amen those great as it was it never finished the sin question so the total answer never came during the answer for sin rather never came in at Abraham's covenant it would come later in the New Covenant praise God but before even that God was going to get two more covenants and it's a good thing he did because they all had purposes and foreshadowing and fulfillment that had to take place now it's what wonderful to see is that the Abrahamic covenant began about 1900 or almost 2,000 years before Christ so did you catch that again so Noah's was about 2,000 years after the garden and then here boom sorry no sir I got that mixed up here I got my stop mixed up there sorry what it was as Abraham I'm sorry God destroyed God destroyed the earth 2,000 years after the garden threw water through Noah and then it's 2000 years Jesus Christ dies on the cross right and then 6000 years the rapture takes place praise God sorry I was kind of getting my numbers mixed up there pardon me but Abraham's covenant does end when the eternal covenant begins I believe because its purpose is now fulfilled because every one alive in that future home will already have the eternal blessings of eternal life there will be no need for any curses right then I don't wanted to curse anybody because the cause of curse the Father curses is done away with Satan and Church the whole earth is full of God's glory already praise God amen and like the Bible said you want to teach every man his neighbor the word because every man will already know it praise God God's Word will already be written in their hearts praise the Lord and before they ask God will answer before they call God will answer already praise God so that covenant can be fulfilled it can be completed in the eternal covenant praise God now let's take the last 20 minutes or so by God's grace and we'll finish up with the Mosaic Covenant the fifth and final covenant praise God they had a few notes I'll be referencing off my tablet as well so we'll start by saying this covenant has the most written about it as far as well I guess is I guess I guess that's up for debate too I can I guess if with the new covenant so you see some of these things I haven't thought through all the way that's why I'm preaching at first to try to catch the inspiration praise God and then finish the chapter later well it depends I guess what you say about you all that for example with the new covenant with all of Paul's writings and Jesus is writing that shows a lot that shares a lot but the mosaic has a lot too because the Mosaic Covenant is covered in exodus chapters 20 through 40 and then also there's a great chapter and Deuteronomy 30 that covers it as well yeah so I got a couple of quotes I want to make sure I read here or a couple of scriptures rather so just bear with me just a second here okay yeah so I'll get to that in just a moment at a scripture I want to read about God's faithfulness to the Covenant okay now I'll get to that one in just a moment there thank you for your patience we'll get to that in just a moment here so 400 years after Abraham the father of faith God raised up a lawgiver praise God's you have a father of faith and now you have a lawgiver by the name of Moses taking all the water here now God initiates this covenant and so let's have Lydia read district an you go to Hebrews 9 so that he's going to read Hebrews 9 19 and 20 so just as Adam's covenant Noah's covenant and Abraham's covenant had shed blood so does the Mosaic Covenant so Lydia can you read Hebrews 9 19 and 20 saying this is the blood of the Testament which God has enjoined unto you amen so now this is that was this that was a reference in Hebrews 9 but it actually took place in gentler Exodus 24 Moses takes the blood he sprinkles the book and he sprinkles the people so the Bible said the blood and joins them or connects them to God's covenant or puts them into God's covenant so again we see blood along with covenants death in order to bring life praise God now God gave Moses two tables of commands called the ten commandments and that symbolizes this new covenant right because all you have to do is see two pictures of two tables of stone that you think Oh Moses the law Moses now of course all of Moses laws was over 600 loss right all of them can be divided into three groups you have the moral law moral laws Ten Commandments abominations you have civil laws just laws within Hebrews and then you have ceremonial laws which aren't Levitical laws now it's beautiful about this is we get a law through Moses but we also get ceremonial sacrifice and a priesthood through Moses praise God so get a lawgiver and we get a priest and get the law and then we get priests so beautiful here now just like the previous two tokens we have the rainbow and the male circumcision now we have another sign so Malachi can read this one here it's exodus 31:16 and 17 you know it's a that's your house if you know that the token for the Mosaic Covenant so exodus 31:16 and 17 whatever you're out there generations for a perpetual covenant is it it is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth the station rested and was refreshed amen so as an ark I read the token for the Mosaic Covenant is sabbath-keeping so now it's it's back to the it's now it's more than the flesh now it's in your daily life or your actions praise God which that's a beautiful thought right there so went from visible to all to something personal in the flesh and then it went to a public life now what's what's striking is that a lot of Christians today and I have two friends that actually do it two brothers in Christ that actually do it but they're they're into Christian Judaism I'm not sure exactly how to say I don't under the exact word my wife would know cuz I forgot but they actually keep the Sabbath they actually keep it and they're not they're not 7-day in Venice either they're just there's Christians that believe in I think they might be Messianic Christian that maybe that's the word there but I think they keep the Passover the Feast of Tabernacles feast of weeks they actually keep those and those friends starting Friday night because from our Friday night actually turns into Saturday s considered Saturday morning so from Friday night to Saturday night our time they don't do anything they stay at home they they don't try to cook very much they don't do any work now look I just went to the church to see this look at the sincerity of that they give up working on and all my friends they could work and make some overtime money they can make big bucks but they give a look how sincere they are they give up the money and all that because they actually think this is still in effect for them and they think that's actually this is God's seal or token for them but church what a greater thing now a lot of those people will do that but they'll remain in their same sins what a greater thing God gives us through the true token today the true Sabbath today resting from our works that we might do God's works amen praise God that's what the New Testament Sabbath is a corned Matthew 11 where Jesus says I'm going to give you rest for your souls and then Hebrews chapter 4 where we rest from our works as God did from his praise God amen because the Bible said there remained a rest for the people of God even after Moses and Joshua there still remained a rest and that was the rest for the soul the soul no no longer tries to work its own will when it's surrendered and it's filled with God's will by the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God amen thank the Lord so thank you for reading that lydian Malka praise God so Israel under the Mosaic Covenant worked six days right basically Sunday to Friday and they took the seventh off Saturday because the Lord made the earth in six days and rested on the Sabbath now there's a couple of portions I want to just reference here we're almost getting done here by God's grace the entire chapter of Deuteronomy 30 expresses God's unfailing commitment to Israel and even the chapter he foretells them that they're going to fall away can you imagine that God is so he's just so straightforward and honest right you don't beat around the bush he blesses them but he tells him you're gonna eventually fall away he said I'm gonna scatter you all over the world yeah and you're gonna reject the forthcoming Messiah but God in Deuteronomy 30 promises to gather Israel from all nations giving her a heart that completely loves him and causing her to forever possess the land of Palestine let's just read one verse in there Deuteronomy 30 just because it'd be good to read it there so you have a little bit of background knowledge on it Deuteronomy 30 now in verse 3 that then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity and thy compassion upon thee and returning gather thee from all the nations whether the LORD thy God has scattered thee so God foretells them you're gonna backslide you're gonna be scattered but I'm gonna bring you back what amazing love praise God now look at verse 10 if thou shall hearken on the voice of the LORD thy God to keep his Commandments and his statutes which are written this book of the law and if thou turn unto the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul praise God would it be scripture they sue you have time you want to read that I'm in numbers right now so my next book will be Deuteronomy or willing about that probably a month or two here praise God what a beautiful beautiful promise now couple more things the purpose of the Mosaic law along with the other things I said like law giver and ceremony and priesthood is also described in Galatians 3:24 the Bible says the law was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ and I'm a schoolteacher so I really like this scripture praise God so the law teaches like a schoolmaster right a strict schoolmaster teacher the law teaches how evil we are to a holy God say because our sins demand a penalty they demand death and not and we just don't send once we sin all the time can I say just kind of plain like this the tabernacle of Moses was like a bloodbath there was just constant animals dying every morning every night and in between when they would have the the the families come in and offer sacrifice it was just blood death death death death all the time it was a teacher to show us how evil we weren't how we could never pay for our own sins we can never earn our own forgiveness that's why we need a real rest today praise God amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost hallelujah to change our hearts see sins demand a penalty death and the law was added because of transgressions so God had to show us because we because of Noah's day every heart was only evil continually God had to add the law to show us the wickedness and the awful consequences of our sins and the Bible says where there's no law there's no transgression so we need even know we didn't the people didn't even know what they were doing really until the law pointed it out and showed how how wicked it really was I think how the law showed how wicked it was to talk back to your parents they can take out the child and stuff that's how wicked talking back to your parents is if a man or woman is caught in adultery both them caught were taken out the street and stoned instantly I mean that's this shows it was where there's no law there's no transgression so the law showed how evil the transgressions were and what God really thought of it what was all this wars all this blood all this bloodshed what was it for it was to teach us like a school teacher that we desperately need one sacrifice not all five of these different kinds and we don't need five we need one sacrifice to take away all of our sins praise God oh thank you Lord Jesus praise God we need one sacrifice and do away with all of it praise God because the law would continue till the seed should come according to Galatians 3:19 that promise see marry see praise God the seed of the woman the sea that would bruise the head of the serpent Jesus Christ that was prophesied in Adams covenant and then our need would be fully satisfied in the New Covenant through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ hallelujah thank the Lord let's read this so Lydia I think you're next six 41 and 42 now this scripture is so important it highlights the principle that God's former covenant blessings remain true even in the current covenant so in other words if you're in the Mosaic Covenant previous promises from the previous covenants still apply to you and you can claim those promises oh praise God that's why that's why I'm for the new covenant where that's where to see the Abraham that's why children who can grow up and say God well the new covenant where that's where to see the Abraham that's why children who can grow up and say god bless me so I have a good job bless my family because I am the seed of Abraham I don't want to be cursed so lord help me to be careful when I say to curse people right but bless me because I want to be a blessing to others God's Word got a bless you you're Abraham's seed faith in Jesus Christ God will bless everything you've been praising God already is investing a lot of things you do praise God because you love the Lord so Lydia Leviticus 26 41 and 42 there uncircumcised hearts be humbled and they then except of the punishment of their iniquity then will I remember my covenant with Jago but also I come to know with Isaac and also I covenant with Abraham will I remember and I will remember the land beautiful God tells them he said through Moses they possess the promised land fall away from the commands causing him to scatter the nations but then he promised I'll restore them to living back in Palestine when they confess their sins in genuine humility church that's all we need today is genuine repentance when Israel did that God would say then I'll remember my covenant with Abraham praise God and I'll remember the land amen what a blessing praise God see repentance activates the Covenant there is he that the the Jews that were scattered they won't get the Covenant blessings until they obey through repentance that's how it is today the comment of the New Testament it's not activated to me obey it to repent repentance activates God's promises amen praise God hallelujah God forever remembers his promises hallelujah even while living in Moses is covenant God will still remember Abraham's covenant to them to give Abraham seed the land of Palestine based upon the condition of their humble obedience right and we know we'll get there normally next week we know the New Covenant now is based upon our obedience as well it's based upon our obedience because the Bible says they can trodden underfoot the blood of the Covenant right it's in Hebrews we'll get to that that'll be a major Scripture people can stop on the blood of the Covenant so see the Covenant is only its condition it's only unconditional by God's foreknowledge amen I know it's conditional to us cuz we know we're not sure but it's unconditional by God's foreknowledge praise God thank the Lord hallelujah remember this humble confession so Leviticus 26 as Lydia read 41 to 42 it when is it fulfilled it's fulfilled in revelation 7 1 through 8 when the hundred forty-four thousand are sealed with the Holy Ghost praise God that's when it's fulfilled because that's when they really humble themselves really repent the fountains are over the house of David and the Holy Spirit looks down upon and fills their souls amen praise God thank you Jesus Oh hallelujah thank the Lord thank you lord so see the Mosaic Covenant is the current covenant blinded Israel is under this moment because they rejected the the New Covenant so they're under the Old Covenant now of course some Jews didn't accept it like you know Peter Paul and other remnant Jews Paul calls them remnant Jews in Romans 10 and 11 they accepted Christ but despite casting away the despite casting away the New Covenant the blinded Israel can still be blessed from all the previous covenants right how many understand that Noah's Covenant still blesses everybody sinner or Saint right it's so blessed because it was made to everybody so everybody's blessed that's how it is with Israel even though they turned on the new one they still have Moses's they still have Abraham's they still have no us to fall back upon we say to fall back upon now there's my hour so let me try to close I think I'm almost done here so any minded Jew who receives God's covenant blessings will receive them if they sincerely love God and obey his commands God cannot cast away all Israel because he promised to bless them and never forget faithful Jews when read some scriptures about that net as we close here so Moses covenant began about 1500 years before Christ and it actually ended for Jesus followers it ended at the resurrection praise God or you might say the cross it's finished but then he had to raise in order to show he conquered and defeated death hell in the grave but the Mosaic Covenant still continues for blinded Jews now let's read this scripture been waiting the reader here is Isaiah 49 13 through 16 so if you got your Bibles Isaiah 49 13 through 16 says sing o heavens and be joyful o earth and break forth into singing o mountains for the LORD hath comforted his people and have mercy upon his afflicted but Zion said the LORD hath forsaken me and my Lord hath forgotten me so that's what Israel say I'm forsaken I'm forgotten but God answers back he said can a woman forget her suckling child but she should not have compassion on her over her on the son of her womb yay they may forget yet will I not forget thee behold I have grave and me upon the palms of my hands thy walls are continually before me praise God so God even tells Israel I've engraved you on the palms of our hands why cuz Jesus was sent to the house of Israel to pay the price for Israel's sins and he even on the cross Jesus even said Father forgive them they don't know what they're doing praise God so any Jew that honestly loves and serves God though blinded can still be saved that's the mystery God's God's mystery of Israel's blindness during the church age well let's stand praise God in your home there by the grace of God God can never forget his people Israel even for told them you're gonna fall away but I'll bring you back praise God now remember my covenant to Abraham I remember the the Mosaic Covenant he said then I'll Mount Zion I open up the house and on the fountain of David praise God and the spirit of grace and supplication will pour upon you praise God and my people will be called by my name again praise God thank you Jesus hallelujah may be Lord willing Sunday we look at the Davidic covenant and then the new covenant and the eternal covenant praise god what a blessing let's remember these great blessings Church here as we worship tonight let's have a word of Prayer have any father we thank you for the word we've heard tonight thank you Lord how faithful you are how gracious through our Lord your promises just keep getting better and better and better and we realize Lord when we run faithful the Covenant yet you remain faithful all you ask is that we just come back and

of your glory may they just come back in genuine repentance forgive them Lord God may they remember that you all the love that was ever poured out was poured out at the cross it doesn't have to be a
