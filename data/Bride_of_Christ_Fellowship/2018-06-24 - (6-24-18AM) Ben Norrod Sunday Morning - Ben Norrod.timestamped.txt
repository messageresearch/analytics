[0:00] said the Bible said brother man said the
[0:03] Bible said and then when you really
[0:05] start getting down to what does it mean
[0:06] they don't have a clue of what you're
[0:08] even talking about because it's by
[0:10] divine revelation and anywhere that you
[0:13] and I go in this walk with God it is not
[0:16] governed by how many times we come to
[0:18] church what kind of offering we put in
[0:29] you
[2:45] that sometimes God's got to reveal
[2:48] certain things to them and if God don't
[2:51] reveal it to you you just don't
[2:52] understand it
[2:53] I realize in the message we've become
[2:55] become legalists and we've got to the
[2:59] place to where we have our own gospel
[3:00] measuring sticks of how we thank people
[3:03] on a lineup and how they ought to live
[3:04] and I understand if a now sister I'm
[3:08] gonna pick on y'all I see Lisa would
[3:09] read on so troubled this morning I'm
[3:11] coming back to the read where I read
[3:14] sister got a little red shirt on but as
[3:16] I told you some time ago there's a
[3:19] preacher said to meet I'm a woman
[3:20] wearing that means a sign of adultery
[3:23] somebody said what do you think about
[3:24] that I said they need to get out of the
[3:26] Scarlet Letter and get in the Bible but
[3:29] it's legalism you see what they're
[3:31] trying to do is they're trying to
[3:33] increase Christianity by their own
[3:35] measuring stick by their own steam and
[3:37] their own stamina and even Jesus said
[3:40] about your physical person that you
[3:42] cannot add a hair of your head you
[3:44] cannot make yourself taller or shorter
[3:45] you can't make this way or that but you
[3:48] are what you are now you could lose
[3:50] weight but you're still the same old
[3:52] person late you could gain weight but
[3:54] it's still the same old bin nor out
[3:56] gaining weight as he would be losing
[3:57] weight and it's the same Christianity
[4:00] it's the same Christian all together but
[4:03] we must realize God is the one that adds
[4:07] to our faith all of these
[4:08] characteristics of Christianity and you
[4:11] realize friends that a lot of time like
[4:12] we got a thing down in the South systems
[4:14] I was picking on you I'm gonna take that
[4:16] for you hey man we got a thing down in
[4:18] the south that women can't wear
[4:20] open-toed shoes our poor sister Adam
[4:23] sandals on this morning they would throw
[4:24] in hell for having a pair of sandals on
[4:26] somebody one preacher told my pastor he
[4:29] said well you realize the reason women
[4:30] can't have their feet exposed he said
[4:33] what's that
[4:33] he's because it comes to have a sexual
[4:35] problem I said my God if that's the case
[4:37] you've got a bigger problem than the
[4:39] open feet a man I saw I said about
[4:42] people in churches have a prostitute
[4:44] walked in this back door and she was
[4:46] dressed very poor and come sat down here
[4:48] on the front every brother in the church
[4:50] he'd have a pile of quotes on top of her
[4:52] but I said the Church of God I said have
[4:55] brothers and got anymore victory in
[4:57] their life than to let a prostitute walk
[4:59] in here
[4:59] so that she can get deliverance from
[5:01] Almighty God and it bothers them so bad
[5:03] maybe they're the ones that should be at
[5:05] the altar instead of her amen I agree
[5:07] she should be there too but what's the
[5:10] bigger problem but you see friends we
[5:12] get in our minds as Christians we think
[5:14] Christianity equals a live affection and
[5:17] a does Christ's perfection will be
[5:20] always in our something we'll always be
[5:22] people that will have to live by God's
[5:25] grace and live by God's mercy at no time
[5:28] and I'll walk with God does he ever just
[5:31] hand us the reins and say alright boy
[5:34] you've learned enough I will let you
[5:35] take care of the rest the Bible said he
[5:38] that began this good work in me and you
[5:41] he will miss this work a man under the
[5:44] day of Jesus Christ I am looking forward
[5:46] to him completing the work in my life
[5:48] but I can't move it myself I can't make
[5:51] things greater myself I can't add one
[5:53] cubic of my spiritual stature by taking
[5:56] thought or reading the Bible or
[5:57] listening to a tape I think people have
[5:59] gotten minds to be spiritual they've got
[6:01] to print two hours they got a Bible all
[6:04] the way through every year they gotta
[6:05] listen to every tape brother Brett I've
[6:06] ever said what are we going to do with
[6:08] them poor people in jungles that don't
[6:10] even have a tape recorder what are we
[6:11] gonna do a folks got Bibles but they got
[6:13] to hold his spirit they've got the
[6:15] leadership of the Spirit of God amen
[6:17] I understand if we've got the message if
[6:19] we got Bibles if we got time to pray we
[6:21] should do all that we can give our very
[6:23] best to the Lord Jesus don't you think
[6:25] so I think we should do our very best
[6:27] for all my honey God again but God can
[6:30] see a little pygmy down in a jungle
[6:33] somewhere that ain't even got a preacher
[6:35] and not to bring that man into the body
[6:38] of Jesus Christ he knows how to handle
[6:40] everything I think sometimes as
[6:43] Americans we get in our brain we we know
[6:45] a little bit more than God sometimes we
[6:48] may not say that from our mouth but our
[6:50] actions prove we'll bit too dependent
[6:53] they make little amen we're a little bit
[6:56] too independent we like to do things our
[6:58] own way and there's only two ways that
[7:02] way God's Way in your way
[7:06] God's will is the right way and then our
[7:08] way is the wrong way
[7:09] he's the one in control of everything I
[7:12] want you to stop and think about the
[7:14] parallel now between you and I and the
[7:17] people that Paul is talking about here
[7:18] now you realize this is the book of
[7:20] Ephesians these are the Ephesian leaders
[7:24] these are the Ephesian Christians 12
[7:27] people that's what this is 12 folks Paul
[7:31] took on time to write to 12 people but
[7:34] Jesse I guess there's hope for me and
[7:35] you brother a lot of people think well
[7:39] if it's not a big crowd than it ain't
[7:40] God God sometimes dwells in the little
[7:42] crowds too he dwells in the little
[7:45] things not not sometimes the big speier
[7:47] up on the hill and and all that he
[7:50] dwells in the little things God is
[7:52] hiding and revealing himself in
[7:55] simplistic things that many times folks
[7:58] overlook man will overlook at a hundred
[8:00] times out of a hundred and that's where
[8:02] God hides himself this ephesian church
[8:05] program tells us in the church age book
[8:07] is going to be the pattern for all the
[8:10] rest of these ages do you realize these
[8:12] people are the pattern for you and I
[8:14] today and here Paul's tell them put away
[8:17] lying be angry and sin not Oh God it was
[8:23] quiet I thought she was quiet now I know
[8:25] you're quiet everything these people
[8:27] he's talking to her born-again
[8:28] Christians you say they're not read
[8:30] verse 30 and tell me they're not he says
[8:33] grieve not the Holy Spirit of God
[8:35] whereby ye well who's he talking to
[8:37] these very same people in the fusion
[8:40] church he's talking to the very same
[8:42] Krissy whereby ye are sealed that's past
[8:45] tense these people had the Holy Ghost
[8:48] but yet Paul is dealing with them get
[8:51] rid of all of these entire ways because
[8:54] these people were drug in off the street
[8:56] wasn't Jews yo they wasn't raised with
[8:59] the book in their hand come on now they
[9:03] wasn't raised with their oxen with the
[9:05] prayer tap and they wasn't raised with
[9:08] the trees and their borders these people
[9:09] were raised off the streets
[9:11] Amen they might have come out of Liberty
[9:13] center they might have come out of Accra
[9:15] they might have come out of defiance who
[9:16] knows where they come from but they
[9:18] wasn't raised in the message that's what
[9:21] these people called the message of the
[9:22] hour
[9:23] his words was the message of that day
[9:25] can you say a man that's Bible that's
[9:27] what the Bible said that these people
[9:29] were followers of Moses and Paul is
[9:31] writing to people who had never been
[9:33] raised in a message church could you
[9:37] imagine a preacher in this day preaching
[9:38] to people who ain't message people
[9:40] oh they throw you out nomination of mark
[9:43] of the beast and all of that that's true
[9:45] I realize that we got all of those
[9:47] elements in the world I realize we got
[9:49] denominational people I realize that not
[9:52] everybody's message the message people
[9:54] who ain't message people amen and I said
[9:57] many times being in a message church
[9:59] doesn't make you any more of a Christian
[10:01] than standing in a garage makes you a
[10:02] mobile room room being a Christian means
[10:06] you must be born again by the Holy Ghost
[10:08] amen the Spirit of God must change your
[10:11] life all things are passed away behold
[10:13] all things have become new
[10:16] amen God's gonna change our life if God
[10:18] don't change it it'll never be changed
[10:21] Amen that's right that's exactly right
[10:23] Paul telling these people lying all
[10:26] right now I want you to listen to this
[10:28] in the jinnee adoption series brother
[10:32] Branham said this church was the most
[10:35] mature Church in the age I want to have
[10:40] to sink into your little skulls there's
[10:42] the fins calls this morning I want to
[10:45] have to soak into that membrane up here
[10:47] for just a moment I want you to think
[10:49] for a moment about what we're talking
[10:50] about here here these people now these
[10:53] are the people that the prophet of God
[10:56] said or the mature church will surely
[10:58] this is the mature tried wise you have
[11:01] to tell a lie if they're mature why is
[11:06] he telling them be angry and sin not
[11:08] because they need to know and in order
[11:12] to be a Christian you got to know you
[11:15] can't guess at it because if you guess
[11:18] you don't have a firm foundation of
[11:19] where you stand the only place that a
[11:21] person can really stand on as a firm
[11:23] foundation come on you say man it ain't
[11:26] gonna hurt you hey many of you getting a
[11:28] good a man stuck in you might hurt you
[11:30] you get it out sometimes there now thank
[11:32] these people are the ones that Paul
[11:36] addressed that was sitting in heavenly
[11:40] places in Christ Jesus I'm just gonna
[11:47] take my time Engel Russia now think
[11:50] about this group that it's not like I
[11:51] said this isn't just a book we read
[11:53] these are people that live lives these
[11:55] individuals are hearing the Apostle Paul
[11:58] say to them put away lying speak trip
[12:02] with every neighbor are you kidding me I
[12:05] thought these people were sitting in
[12:07] heavenly places they were they were and
[12:11] Paul was hoping to keep him there in
[12:16] order to keep him there he had to come
[12:18] to chapter 4 alright and I don't you to
[12:20] forget this in verse 25 that's where we
[12:23] started right
[12:23] verse 11 tells them God gave them
[12:26] apostles prophets teachers evangelists
[12:28] and pastors for the perfecting of the
[12:30] saints for the edifying of the work of
[12:32] God and the ministry and all these
[12:33] things he just gets through telling them
[12:35] God has send it on high gave gifts down
[12:37] to man just read them first three or
[12:39] four chapters until you hit verse 25 and
[12:42] see if you don't drop open and looking
[12:44] at it here are these men and women that
[12:47] are supposed to be the most mature of
[12:49] the age Paul is telling them things that
[12:52] nobody else is hurt and then spends all
[12:57] this time dealing with this in Chapter
[12:58] four it doesn't make any sense to me
[13:01] he doesn't make it he says I mean
[13:03] humanly speaking if these people are
[13:07] sitting in heavenly places why is he
[13:09] telling don't give place to the devil
[13:11] why is he telling them he stoled don't
[13:14] let him steal no more be ye kind one to
[13:17] another because mature people still need
[13:20] the gospel preached to them because no
[13:24] matter how mature you might be you're
[13:26] still a human being
[13:28] oh praise the Lord Amen that woke a few
[13:35] of you up this morning that's right
[13:36] that's right all but rather bit I'm a
[13:39] child of God's over these I've got the
[13:42] Holy Ghost so today I'm born again so do
[13:46] these people
[13:47] I believe the message so did these folks
[13:50] but all of this had to be preached
[13:53] amen get it again put away lying now
[13:57] this this word lying it see Greek words
[14:00] Studios which is where we get the
[14:02] English word pseudo you probably heard
[14:03] that in Psychological terms a pseudo
[14:06] sizz basically an intentional falsehood
[14:09] an intentional falsehood Paul Stang quit
[14:12] intention and lying and put that away
[14:15] from you
[14:18] same people he said you're sitting in
[14:20] heavenly places in Christ Jesus with
[14:22] this is the same body that he said that
[14:26] Christ Christ is in you the hope of
[14:30] glory same group so he tells them in
[14:34] Ephesians 1 he said after you heard the
[14:36] word of promise the word of truth he
[14:38] said you were sealed with the Holy
[14:39] Spirit he said Christ is on the inside
[14:41] he's not in heaven any more ease in you
[14:44] deity dwells in you Christ isn't in
[14:47] heaven friends he's in you oh you got it
[14:50] in your mind that crisis in heaven he's
[14:52] not he's on the earth than you
[14:53] what formed Jesus is in right now he's
[14:56] in the form of the elect so brother
[14:59] branham said there's no hands mature
[15:01] hands he has no ears mature ears no feet
[15:05] mature feet oh you're getting quiet but
[15:07] I just quoted you a bunch of quotes if
[15:09] you believe the message should be able
[15:09] say amen to that
[15:10] amen DD's not in heaven so a brother man
[15:13] said deity is in you Christ in you the
[15:16] hope of glory so did these people why
[15:21] preach such things to them because they
[15:24] still were human beings right notice
[15:28] from the English this word pseudo means
[15:31] not genuine a sham a bogus a phony Paul
[15:37] is telling mature spirit-filled people
[15:40] don't be a phony don't be bogus Laura to
[15:45] God
[15:46] amazing amazing that it even saves such
[15:49] things
[15:50] notice put away all lying speak every
[15:53] man truth with this neighbor now this is
[15:56] not necessarily the Word of God but this
[15:58] word truth is ilithyia which is the
[16:01] truth in any matter of consideration
[16:04] meaning anything true either pertaining
[16:07] to God or pertaining to the duties of
[16:09] man truth isn't considered personal
[16:12] excellence or the candor of mind
[16:16] anything that is the opposite of a
[16:19] falsehood or deceit so Paul saying be
[16:23] honest with your neighbors speak truth
[16:25] one to another now watch how pop
[16:28] identifying that these Christians speak
[16:30] to one another you know sometimes we
[16:32] have people in our ranks that have a
[16:35] tendency to put on what I like to call
[16:37] false humility in other words you know
[16:40] you ask them how they're doing and
[16:42] they'll give you a 47 page dissertation
[16:45] on glory to God the Lord been so good to
[16:47] me and angels fed me cereal this morning
[16:49] and hallelujah and I was I was communing
[16:53] with Gabriel and I was I was praying and
[16:55] Michael was there I friends you and I
[16:58] both know that's not what we call
[16:59] reality a meant more likely it wasn't
[17:03] gable that poured your Cheerios it was
[17:04] Lucifer forgive me Amen most the time
[17:08] for it ain't got nothin to do with all
[17:10] of these airs that we put on as message
[17:12] people we like to do that where do you
[17:14] go to church I believe in the seventh
[17:17] Malachi 4 or 5 Luke 17 30 I try the
[17:21] Prophet not the second one not the fifth
[17:24] one but the right one there I had you
[17:26] for the right age Lord my time you get
[17:28] done with all that people that doesn't
[17:30] falling asleep on you they know what you
[17:31] get that because friends people in the
[17:34] world do not identify with shams or
[17:37] phony or bogus or put on airs they
[17:40] identify with real people having real
[17:42] experiences
[17:44] somebody the lady at the motel asked me
[17:46] she said you're the visiting preacher I
[17:48] said yes ma'am I am
[17:49] she's what kind of church are y'all I
[17:51] said we're nondenominational she said
[17:53] what does that mean I said it means
[17:55] we're not a denomination I read she got
[17:58] to talking a little bit and she said
[17:59] well III don't understand that I said
[18:02] well ma'am I said it's real simple I
[18:03] said the denominational Church gets that
[18:05] orders and their cues from a
[18:07] headquarters somebody tells him what to
[18:09] preach somebody tells him what's in the
[18:10] you know in the program that day oh she
[18:12] said I've been to churches like a
[18:14] minutes for this and ten
[18:16] minutes for that 30 minutes for that I
[18:17] said yes ma'am I said a
[18:19] non-denominational like we are we just
[18:21] go where the this tells us to Amen I
[18:25] know some pastor's brother Jesse that
[18:27] would have had heart failure when I
[18:28] walked out that office and stood in the
[18:30] congregation and you ain't allowed out
[18:32] in the church you're supposed to stay
[18:33] back there until they sing only believe
[18:35] all things are impossible
[18:36] hey but listen that's the thing about
[18:38] being free born by the Holy Spirit we
[18:41] have the ability to move as the spirit
[18:43] leaves us and then to move in the
[18:46] auspice and the action of the Holy not
[18:49] to be governed by some man's idea
[18:51] governed by some traditional thing some
[18:54] man's theology of how things should be
[18:56] done
[18:57] Amen like I said about sister Lisa in
[19:00] the red shirt like I said sister and her
[19:02] sandals that's man's idea of things I
[19:05] don't understand where people get such
[19:08] ideas it when we worship God we're
[19:10] supposed to worship in a certain way and
[19:12] for instance and I believe in all the
[19:14] worship of God that that that comes with
[19:17] rejoicing and clapping our hands and
[19:20] saying amen and hallelujah but you look
[19:22] at the world today people have become
[19:24] programmed I'm not my message people and
[19:27] you listen at them in different
[19:28] conventions and meetings you'll be out
[19:30] there and and and when the preacher says
[19:32] something good Amen everybody will clap
[19:35] in unison that's a worldly thing friends
[19:37] that's not the Spirit of God leading
[19:39] people that's a worldly thing that's a
[19:41] worldly move amongst the people of this
[19:43] message to clap in unison any hypocrite
[19:46] can sit there in the church and clap his
[19:48] hands along with you any any deceiver
[19:50] can clap his hands along with you but it
[19:52] takes a real child of God amen
[19:54] full of the holy go to setting' service
[19:56] Wednesday after Wednesday Sunday after
[19:58] Sunday and I believe it is the truth
[20:02] amen
[20:03] but any more our churches have got into
[20:06] this clapping thing everybody claps in
[20:08] unison and what is it it's a worldly
[20:10] idea it's a traditional thing people
[20:13] have gotten himself in such a tradition
[20:15] that if the preacher preaches beyond 45
[20:17] minutes oh god they go to the two
[20:19] tablets of stone that's the conduct
[20:21] order and doctrine if you didn't know it
[20:22] Moses had his two tablets we got ours
[20:25] Amen they go to the two tablets of stone
[20:27] and they pulled out every court that
[20:29] they can
[20:29] where the prophet of God said most
[20:31] effective sermon is 45 minutes I know
[20:33] that quotes in there as well but better
[20:35] better I'm also said that if you're in a
[20:37] room full of believers he said you could
[20:39] stay there all night long how come they
[20:41] don't quote that one amen you know what
[20:44] it is tradition friends people are
[20:47] getting so stooped in tradition and so
[20:49] steeped in their ideas that you couldn't
[20:52] change him if you had a rocket to blow
[20:53] him out of there out of a hat of orbit
[20:55] nearly back home in Manchester it's an
[20:58] open country town I'm not throwing off
[21:01] on him but they the country they just
[21:04] don't have any class some of them people
[21:06] out there they just don't have any class
[21:08] and I know it's my hometown but it's my
[21:11] hometown I can talk about it if I want
[21:13] to some of them just don't have any
[21:15] class and our people out there they're
[21:17] becoming known for gas stations banks
[21:20] we're becoming the interstate town and
[21:22] then people setting out there the other
[21:25] day they had an old building they've
[21:26] been trying to fix things up and they
[21:28] hired a lady from Nashville my wife and
[21:30] I spoke to the man whom wife had
[21:32] actually hired the lady to come paint
[21:35] this mural on the side of the building

[21:48] Magnolia leaf coming right out of the
[21:51] picture that's a beautiful side and the
[21:54] elders of the town got angry at her and
[21:56] said it doesn't represent Manchester
[21:58] Tennessee said horse-trading would have
[22:00] been a better representation I said we
[22:02] are in the United States of America with
[22:04] an American flag on the side of the
[22:06] building how in the name of God don't
[22:08] that represent Manchester Tennessee you
[22:11] know what it is I'll read some comments
[22:13] again and again and again and again the
[22:15] people are still holding on to their
[22:16] ideas they don't want the town to grow
[22:18] we're becoming a drug town be coming to
[22:20] this town be coming to that town but
[22:22] they'll bring Bonner your honor ruin
[22:24] every year if you don't know what

[22:27] Bonnaroo is basically Woodstock in
[22:30] Manchester Tennessee all of the big
[22:32] names the Olsen twins mary-kate and
[22:34] Ashley Olsen and Jimmy Fallon and they
[22:36] had Eminem here this year I mean all of
[22:38] the big Hollywood stars will bus

[22:43] in there their million-dollar things and
[22:44] this at the other and they'll set that
[22:46] out in the middle of a cow pasture
[22:48] friends account so an announcer the
[22:50] joining for their stuff that they'll
[22:52] have all of them people congregate out
[22:54] there amen and bring all of them people
[22:56] out like that and then they'll have a
[22:58] battle cry over somebody painting a flag
[23:00] on the side of a building
[23:02] now I said all that to give you a real
[23:04] world example of where we're living at
[23:06] in people's today's thank you it isn't
[23:08] so much just message people but offer
[23:11] has become type people they've got their
[23:15] ways of doing things and they don't want
[23:16] nobody to encroach upon their way of
[23:18] doing anything didn't Redman tell us
[23:20] what this is lady or sea of people's
[23:22] rights I've got my rights you've got
[23:25] yours and don't affect my rights and I

[23:29] gonna kick your cat that's the way
[23:32] people in the lady of C&H thank so
[23:34] rather than progress rather than
[23:36] innovation rather do something that will
[23:38] benefit mankind and benefit humankind
[23:41] and help people along and make things
[23:43] better for life make things nicer people
[23:46] will split hairs over the tiniest little
[23:48] bitty things that's a spirit upon the
[23:51] world that was a spirit upon the
[23:54] churches when Paul's preaching these
[23:56] things he's trying to keep these demons
[23:59] off the children of God because friends
[24:02] if we're not careful will become the
[24:03] same way now listen III don't I'm not a
[24:06] Republican or a Democrat but I thought
[24:08] mister done an excellent job down North
[24:10] Korea the other day he walked in there
[24:13] and and completely D armed the entire
[24:16] nation I mean he D armed them ain't no
[24:19] telling what they're gonna get in return
[24:20] but he's a businessman he walked in
[24:22] there and I mean how many newscast
[24:24] before the man could even get from the
[24:27] negotiating table Fox CNN all the rest
[24:30] of was already flat off on the president
[24:32] oh you ain't done this in the ain't done
[24:34] that why it don't support their liberal
[24:36] agenda it don't support their
[24:38] homosexuals kissing in the streets in
[24:40] front of our kids and all the rest I'm
[24:42] not a politician this isn't a political
[24:44] platform but when you see the devil the
[24:46] devil is the devil amen and that spirit
[24:50] out there comes amongst religious folk
[24:52] because you realize friends the highest
[24:55] form of
[24:56] demon power there is is religion not
[24:58] politics but religion you'll never meet
[25:01] any more higher form of devil power than
[25:03] you will in the ranks of religion and
[25:05] look at people in the churches they
[25:06] don't want nobody to tell them how to
[25:08] live nobody to tell them how to act to
[25:11] tell them how to clean their lives let
[25:15] me do what I want to do I've got the
[25:16] books and the tapes like you do you that
[25:18] maybe so but you don't have a gift and
[25:21] you might have the same message book I
[25:23] got but my gift will bring things out of
[25:25] it that you can't do because you ain't
[25:26] got a gift to do it
[25:27] amen brother Jesse brother kam brother
[25:29] Simon all these gifted men that you
[25:31] enjoy their ministries all of these
[25:33] different brothers that are gifted in
[25:34] Jesus say he gave gifts under man
[25:36] hallelujah amen and what was it all
[25:39] those gifts the prophet of God said was
[25:41] in the Lord Jesus he was the gift and
[25:43] that what st. John 3:16 said God so
[25:45] loved the world he gave it was a gift
[25:47] and all them gifts was inside the Lord
[25:50] Jesus he had all nine spiritual gifts in
[25:52] him yeah this ministry gifts in it and
[25:55] when he came on the day of Pentecost he
[25:57] bursted himself up in a million
[25:59] different pieces and all of them gifts
[26:01] went into the body of Christ
[26:03] some people are gifted and woodworking
[26:06] some people are gifted in art some
[26:09] people are gifted in preaching I won't
[26:12] tell you how to paint your canvas if
[26:13] you'll keep out of my pulpit a man you
[26:18] understand me but people's rights lay do
[26:20] see him brother John they've got these
[26:21] ideas in their mind all we have to do
[26:23] things in a certain way and then what
[26:25] happens they end up doing it the same
[26:27] old way they've always done expecting a
[26:28] different result
[26:29] getting deeper in the traditional sin
[26:31] and that's what it is traditional sin
[26:34] not getting him any closer to God it's
[26:36] getting them into a way to where they
[26:38] absolutely cannot recognize the presence
[26:40] of God amongst them unless he comes the
[26:44] way they want him to and you know the
[26:48] definition that is a Jezebel
[26:50] because that's exactly what Jezebel was
[26:53] all about she wanted God sure but she
[26:55] wanted him the way she wants I said to a
[26:59] group of people here just the other day
[27:00] some of you all that are kind of quiet
[27:02] type people I don't sound like I'm gonna
[27:04] pick on you I've been picking on people
[27:05] all morning brother hey man but if the
[27:08] Holy Spirit moved on you
[27:10] and made you feel like you want to shout
[27:11] are you willing to shout if you say man
[27:15] to that you're not a Jezebel but if
[27:17] you're a quiet person the Holy Spirit
[27:18] moved on you and you is resistant to it
[27:20] that's a Jezebel spirit other way around
[27:23] if you're an emotional person hold on a
[27:25] moment
[27:25] now it's time to really listen and lock
[27:28] in would you cry now oh no we gotta make
[27:31] the service has to be loud to have a
[27:33] service maybe not maybe God wants you to
[27:35] think for a little while I've been in
[27:37] church services sometimes friends where
[27:39] God just wants you to think a little
[27:40] while
[27:40] amen amen somebody right but if you can
[27:44] say Lord what you want to do I'll let
[27:46] you do it that's not a Jezebel spirit
[27:48] that's an anointing that comes from a
[27:50] man or a woman that's willing to let
[27:51] Jesus have the right okay right all of
[27:55] these things that Paul said be honest
[27:57] one with another friends I think one of
[28:00] the biggest problems we've got in
[28:01] churches is people just ain't honest
[28:03] with one another if somebody hurts your
[28:06] feelings you know how you do brother did
[28:09] I offend you oh no no no no no no no no
[28:12] no no no no no no no no no no no and
[28:15] they got so much involved when they say
[28:17] them knows it's like that little old
[28:19] thing in a story I read that one time he
[28:20] said me thank you stile protesteth too
[28:22] much you know something's wrong rather
[28:27] than say well brother but be honest back
[28:30] on the other side you know I did get a
[28:32] little offended about that but I don't
[28:34] know why maybe it's just the way you
[28:35] said things or maybe I just don't
[28:37] understand you or maybe it's me I know
[28:39] you understand that people could talk
[28:40] one another like that they'd solve
[28:42] problems so quickly husbands and wives
[28:45] if they be honest one with another
[28:47] they'd solve things so quickly that's
[28:50] exactly right
[28:51] they'd solve things very fast but a lot
[28:53] of times we don't want to speak the
[28:55] truth because our pride keeps us from
[28:58] saying things that will make us
[29:00] vulnerable and as Christians we don't
[29:03] want to be vulnerable anything but
[29:06] vulnerability we've got the power to
[29:09] speak words so we can't be vulnerable
[29:11] and wise preaching this way to the
[29:13] mature people set in heavenly places
[29:15] he's trying to show them how to be a
[29:18] real world Christian you see if we
[29:20] become disconnected from the people
[29:23] we're trying to
[29:24] the people were trying to live right in
[29:26] front of if we become disconnected from
[29:28] the human side of things do you realize
[29:31] you can't even understand Jesus right
[29:33] unless you're connected with the human
[29:35] side of things because you look at Jesus
[29:37] standing there crying at the grave of
[29:39] Lazarus and said I thought he was God he
[29:42] was but he was also human man in case
[29:49] y'all forgot it Jesus was God but he was
[29:53] also a human being and when he stood
[29:55] there crying at the grave of Lazarus he
[29:57] was crying because his friend was dead
[30:00] that was the human side maybe that woman
[30:03] came to read around that time as a
[30:04] program Jesus was just a man and I can
[30:06] prove it and she brought him out
[30:08] scripture where jesus wept
[30:09] he said lady you remember his works he
[30:12] said your argument is thinner than the
[30:14] broth made from the shadow of a chicken
[30:15] started here and people that Bob Jones
[30:18] are passing out what theological
[30:20] terminology he said that doesn't prove
[30:24] anything you said it proves he was a man
[30:26] yes he said but who was that glory to
[30:28] God and then the scratch shoulders back
[30:30] wiped his face off and Lazarus come
[30:34] forth amen he said if he had not had
[30:38] called the name Lazarus he said the
[30:40] giant action would have taken place
[30:41] right there
[30:43] hey man yes he was God yes he was the
[30:47] Holy Spirit even in a human body but he
[30:50] was also a human being that was the part
[30:53] that made me love who Jesus was
[30:55] as an Old Testament you couldn't
[30:57] identify with the cloud between the
[31:00] cherubims it was hard to identify with a
[31:03] God that was above us but when God
[31:06] became with us all praise the Lord when
[31:10] God came down to become us it made God
[31:14] personable that we could understand him
[31:17] you see Jesus sitting on our Rock
[31:20] groaning with a headache how many can
[31:21] understand that mm-hmm
[31:24] you see Jesus sick in his body you see
[31:26] Jesus being made fun of you see Jesus
[31:29] being lied on how many can identify with
[31:31] that come on let me kid over chickens I
[31:32] be Eagles raise your hand up even then
[31:35] if
[31:36] that type of life that's what God wanted
[31:38] to do he wanted to make himself personal
[31:40] to us hallelujah amen that we could
[31:43] identify we could connect our self with
[31:46] that kind of God to become personal to
[31:49] you and I he would make sense to us
[31:53] because the God of the Old Testament
[31:54] didn't make sense it still don't make
[31:56] sense to a lot of people but the Old
[31:59] Testament you filter him into the life
[32:00] of Jesus Christ and look how that word
[32:02] comes alive well if it's that way in the
[32:05] Old Testament wouldn't it be that way in
[32:07] the New Testament you could hand
[32:08] somebody a book you could hand somebody
[32:10] a tape you can tell them about the
[32:11] prophet of God but unless all of that
[32:13] revelation filters into somebody they
[32:15] can work with somebody they see in a
[32:17] restaurant somebody they meet on the
[32:19] street it doesn't make sense to what
[32:21] you're even talking about they could
[32:23] study skills and thunders all day but
[32:25] never understand the revelation that's
[32:28] right oh thank you Jesus what Paul goes
[32:32] on to tell him now he said let all
[32:34] bitterness I what a statement let out
[32:37] bitterness go away from you now I'm
[32:40] coming down into the latter part of
[32:42] these verses we read this verse 31 let
[32:46] all bitterness and wrath anger clamor
[32:49] evil speaking be put away from you my
[32:53] the word bitterness here pick areia it
[32:57] is the extreme wickedness in some cases
[33:01] it's known as a bitter root producing a
[33:05] bitter fruit and some definitions mara
[33:09] denoting that which is bitter could also
[33:12] be applied to bile or gall that is
[33:16] secreted from your liver and intense
[33:18] bitterness you know how it is after
[33:20] you've had a stomach virus and sick and
[33:22] mid vomiting you vomit or puke out here
[33:24] which one you all do I done forgot
[33:26] ohioans I forget I've been in Tennessee
[33:29] so many years I guess it's the same
[33:30] thing with your vomit your puke and
[33:32] either way in it but in the stomach you
[33:35] understand after so long it's empty now
[33:39] we're getting ready go eat at lunch I
[33:41] don't mean to make you sick before I get
[33:42] into all this but I'm trying to show you
[33:44] what what bitterness is all about don't
[33:46] think about this when I get done saying
[33:47] all this just put it out of your mind
[33:49] when I'm done
[33:50] and maybe I should save it for tonight I
[33:52] don't know we may eat again tonight who
[33:53] knows but that which is in your stuff
[33:57] when your stomach is empty after a while
[34:00] you you you you feel that gaggy type
[34:03] feeling we call it dry heaving used to
[34:05] say it's sick he's dry heaving the bile
[34:08] and the gah that's inside of your
[34:10] stomach you know that sick type feeling
[34:13] a taste that gets in your mouth that
[34:15] that's something that gurgles happen
[34:17] when you feel so sick and you don't have
[34:18] anything else to vomit out this is what
[34:22] Paul called bitterness this is how God
[34:26] looks at bitterness in the human heart
[34:29] if you picture in your mind I'm trying
[34:31] to give you a word picture if you can
[34:32] picture in your mind that old sick
[34:34] feeling dry heaving nothing but gall in
[34:37] your stomach this is what God called
[34:39] bitterness amongst the body what know
[34:42] what and what a nasty horrible thing it
[34:45] is to God what a horrible thing it is to
[34:48] the believer to have such things inside
[34:50] of their heart
[34:51] remember the prophet of God in His Word
[34:53] to the church in Christ the mystery he
[34:55] exhorted the believers of the Branham
[34:57] time and are not the outsiders but the
[34:59] believers of the Tabernacle to not let
[35:01] the root of bitterness take hold in
[35:02] their hearts because this is what God
[35:05] looks at as bitterness exactly in the
[35:08] book of Job at different pots for
[35:11] example job 16:13 in job 20 in verses 14
[35:17] and 25 of that twentieth chapter there
[35:18] 14 and 25 it's also referred to as the
[35:22] poison of serpents I think of this the
[35:25] poison of serpents the ancients
[35:28] erroneously believed was a Serpent's
[35:31] gull or his poison was what they would
[35:35] say the Serpent's gull again from this
[35:37] commentary from Adam Clarke he says Ross
[35:40] which generally translates goal in the
[35:43] English bow rendered hemlock in hosea
[35:46] chapter 10 verse 4 in Deuteronomy
[35:48] chapter 32 verse 33 in job chapter 20
[35:52] verse 16 so going from 14 down to verses
[35:55] 25 you'll see different spots rosh r OS
[35:58] h which denotes the poison or
[36:01] the venom from the serpent remember this
[36:03] is what the serpent shot or put into the
[36:07] heart of Eve when he stood there taking
[36:09] the word and turning that word around I
[36:11] believed that he had to put some kind of
[36:14] bitterness of some sort against God and
[36:16] His Word in order to get her mind opened
[36:18] up because why would she think God was
[36:21] hiding something from her because the
[36:23] prophet of God said she looked at the
[36:25] serpent and realized God wasn't telling
[36:27] her everything what was it it was
[36:31] bitterness in her heart a little small
[36:32] something raised up well God's trying to
[36:35] hide something from me and the serpent
[36:37] said well of course he is that's what
[36:39] I'm trying to tell you I've been talking
[36:41] to you all these months and years Eve
[36:43] trying to let you know look at your
[36:44] dainty hands look at your figure look at
[36:47] everything else after the mouth is a
[36:49] pretty one except for when it comes to
[36:51] you you know why God made you special
[36:54] and after a while maybe the little shot
[36:57] and I'm bitterness or gall was placed
[37:00] inside of her heart just enough of a
[37:02] manner to where she could say well if
[37:04] that's the way it be maybe this guy
[37:06] knows something that I could really use
[37:08] he said I make you a god can I ask you a
[37:12] question what was she before the devil
[37:14] got ahold of her she was a god but you
[37:18] see how how pathetic and how pitiful the
[37:20] devil is he'll promise you something he
[37:22] can't even deliver on we call it
[37:24] bluffing
[37:25] he backed her out of her position but he
[37:29] shot into her heart the venom of gall
[37:31] the venom of golf business placed it
[37:34] into her heart
[37:35] I just kindly believe that's part of it
[37:37] oh there might have been other elements
[37:38] but that had to be somehow associated in
[37:41] there because why would a woman turn
[37:42] against God why would she turn against
[37:44] her husband why
[37:46] something had to take place other riders
[37:48] also say that it might be some very some
[37:52] kind of a plant that would bear these
[37:56] types of either poppies or some sort of
[37:59] a type of berry on this end of this
[38:01] plant and the Bible said that whenever
[38:04] this was offered to Jesus at crucifixion
[38:08] the wine mingled with gall you remember
[38:12] the case when they took it put it up on
[38:13] the salt and put it to his
[38:15] Barry had a type of poison in it that
[38:19] would work like an anesthetic over the
[38:22] human body and diminished the sense of
[38:24] suffering but the Lord Jesus had us on
[38:28] his mind that he didn't want to diminish
[38:32] not one bit of suffering he wanted to
[38:35] take the full brunt of God's wrath so
[38:37] that we could be liberated down the road
[38:39] Oh hallelujah to the lamb of God what
[38:43] Allah loved what I love what I love our
[38:46] savior has for us amen he didn't want to
[38:48] diminish not any sense remember the
[38:50] Bible said took it in his mouth and
[38:52] instead out when he realized what it was
[38:54] hey man it would make like that poison
[38:56] would almost I don't know if any of
[38:58] y'all like to cook but in Asian cooking
[39:01] they have a type it's not kimchi but
[39:03] it's the type of a type of seed I'll
[39:06] think of it in a moment and it numbs
[39:08] your tongue when you get a hold of it
[39:10] ask me again next week I may remember
[39:13] God I'm over 40 I done told you I keep
[39:15] forgetting things walk through the house
[39:17] so today I have my glasses on my
[39:18] forehead went for 40 minutes looking for
[39:20] my glasses here I'm a crazy for a man
[39:23] but it's a certain type of little seed
[39:25] you put it in your mouth you season your
[39:26] food with it and it will make you kind
[39:28] of numb a little bit I was trying to
[39:30] think of the name of it but this is the
[39:32] same type of idea that kind of this
[39:35] berry kind of had like a numbing effect
[39:37] almost like you think used to take that
[39:40] old did you ever use this stuff rub it
[39:43] on their chest when they had to cold
[39:44] it's got that my mom called it camphor
[39:47] it ain't camphor I don't know what they
[39:48] call that stuff but anyhow it's got that
[39:50] real that real heavy smell to it opens
[39:53] up your sinuses and you know stuff I'm
[39:55] talking about it's got that numbing
[39:57] effect on and bengay and and and and I
[40:00] see hot and these type of things they
[40:02] got that numbing type effect that's
[40:04] that's what this berry that's what this
[40:07] girl does to the human body it numbs
[40:10] their senses numbs their senses where
[40:14] they can't feel that's what bitterness
[40:16] does to a person it numbs them to the
[40:19] sensitivity to their brother to the word
[40:21] to the Spirit of God to everybody around
[40:23] them you look around this world people
[40:27] don't have any feeling anymore why they
[40:31] have ingested so much of this gall berry
[40:34] that his nunim
[40:36] and Jesus said they would be so drunk on
[40:39] it that the love of many would wax cold
[40:41] in the last days they can feed me now
[40:45] how are we supposed to bear burning as
[40:47] if you're eat up with bitterness how can
[40:49] I bear your burden and teach you the
[40:52] things of God and share things with you
[40:54] in the word and all that how can I do
[40:57] that if I meet up with a bitterness that
[40:59] numbs my very spiritual senses Oh God I
[41:03] can't feel for the people you realize
[41:05] this what happened to brother Branham
[41:06] when he got locked up in that complex he
[41:09] got a hold of some gall berries he got
[41:12] ahold of some of these berries that was
[41:14] numbing he said I gotta realize they're
[41:16] not sawdust he said they're flesh and
[41:18] blood he said I can't help him unless I
[41:20] can feel for them you take them with
[41:22] Moses standing there with them children
[41:24] sitting out there
[41:25] it shouldn't the Israel children of
[41:28] Israel rather them them children of God
[41:30] that had called out in there they are
[41:32] they they've done idol worship they've
[41:34] they've they've carried out about Moses
[41:36] I'd like to do in a wrong way and -
[41:39] stood there in the gap between God and
[41:40] the people and God take them not me he
[41:44] didn't eat gall berries that's why he
[41:45] could do it
[41:46] there was nothing at him glory to God he
[41:50] had a feeling for his people and if you
[41:54] don't feel for your family like that
[41:55] your family's gone you don't feel for
[41:58] your church like that your church is
[41:59] gone I don't mean just the I mean you
[42:02] sitting right in here because remember
[42:04] the church is not the preacher the
[42:06] people or the church you are what makes
[42:09] up the body deacons don't control the
[42:12] church the pastor don't even control the
[42:13] church the Holy Spirit controls the
[42:16] church and all of us are subject to the
[42:18] Holy Spirit how can we be subject to a
[42:20] god that we've lost feeling in that we
[42:23] can't feel him when he moves we can't
[42:25] feel sensitive when he wants to speak to
[42:27] us and tell us things Amen have we got
[42:29] ahold of rosh have we got ahold of gall
[42:32] berries have we got ahold of spiritual
[42:34] hemlock that it's made us something to
[42:37] the things of God that a man can preach
[42:39] a holiness sermon we were
[42:40] got the door and say all that his idea
[42:42] of it that's goal that's bitterness Paul
[42:45] said let such things depart from you you
[42:47] see this is why this was a mature church
[42:50] because they could take into their
[42:52] hearts this understanding of the word
[42:54] and receive it Paul wouldn't have
[42:56] preached to him this way there couldn't
[42:57] it took it that's the reason I'm
[42:59] preaching it to you because you can take
[43:02] it you believe these things amen I
[43:04] believe it's right right now watches
[43:08] evil speaking the word he uses here for
[43:11] evil speaking is blasphemy ax which
[43:16] means to slander or speech interests to
[43:20] another's good name the prophet of God
[43:23] said you don't have to take a gun and
[43:25] shoot a man speak against his character
[43:28] and you've already killed him you
[43:30] blaspheme his name it's what Paul said
[43:32] let all blaspheme depart from now we
[43:35] would never want to blaspheme the name
[43:37] of God you're saying out there and you
[43:39] let somebody come in and and and sit
[43:43] down in a restaurant maybe they said old
[43:45] cuss word with the name of the Lord
[43:46] taking in vain are you jelly do you cut
[43:49] him a look out of your eyes don't you
[43:51] look at me that way I know you would I
[43:52] would - ha ha ha - ignore him
[43:56] yeah but in your you'd be thinking you
[43:58] rascal you you need to get saved come on
[44:01] church so much Sam so smut thing about
[44:04] the Lord which say you have a crutch you
[44:06] need to get the Holy Ghost
[44:07] sure we would we'd tell them some cases
[44:11] we probably reach out and take a mother
[44:13] do that you're getting quiet on me but
[44:17] it's the truth we would sure would but
[44:22] we blaspheme one another's name and not
[44:24] worry about that old so and so and so
[44:27] and so and such and such and let me tell
[44:30] you what the problem was so and so is
[44:31] and you know such and such and his we're
[44:35] blaspheming each other's names
[44:36] remember the prophet of God said your
[44:39] attitude towards your brother could
[44:40] determine their eternal destination your
[44:43] attitude toward one and your attitude
[44:45] toward the other is your attitude toward
[44:47] Jesus Christ as well
[44:50] sure somebody sat down with you a
[44:53] cigarette hanging out of him out and
[44:55] took the name of the Lord and bet he's a
[44:56] shot your mouth you filthy thing but we
[45:00] let it go on about each other in the
[45:02] churches one speak ill of another run
[45:06] and run down another's influence
[45:07] blaspheme their name and it doesn't even
[45:11] bother us wonder if we hold our berries
[45:14] god help us let me go just a bit further
[45:17] and listen let's close times getting
[45:18] away from us but be ye kind one to
[45:21] another I'm gonna pick some of this up
[45:22] again and out we got a whole lot more
[45:24] here to deal with but I'm just going to
[45:25] get the the foundation of this this
[45:27] morning but be kind ones another I like
[45:30] the meaning of this word it means fit
[45:32] for use to be useful to be virtuous or
[45:37] to be mild now you realize that
[45:41] Christians are supposed to be mild type
[45:44] people not rude
[45:47] not in jurists but mild type people how
[45:54] can a man who says he loves you say he
[45:57] loves you and then say something so hard
[45:59] and harsh and mean all the time I make
[46:03] you wonder sometimes even in marriages
[46:05] you take a man always putting his wife
[46:07] down a wife always putting her husband
[46:09] down but you're in the rubber meets the
[46:11] road oh I love him you might love him in
[46:13] principle but you don't love him in your
[46:14] actions to love him you got to have the
[46:18] type of attitude all the time that shows
[46:20] you love him right
[46:22] being kind one to another be useful to
[46:26] one another be vacuous to one another be
[46:30] mild to one another and you say why is
[46:33] this important because here's why
[46:35] the prophet of God if as I've tried
[46:37] courted to you if you said deity is in
[46:39] you and not in heaven if Christ is in
[46:41] your heart and you're a Holy Ghost field
[46:43] child of God if the Spirit of God is in
[46:46] me and the Spirit of God is in you then
[46:48] that means that life passes from one
[46:51] member to another do you realize if
[46:55] we've got the right attitude one to
[46:57] another when you walk up and shake out
[47:00] his hand you could pass virtue from you
[47:03] to that brother or sister
[47:06] in the message Messiah 1961 revenge said
[47:10] in divine healing they have proven that
[47:12] there's a light passes in divine healing
[47:14] they put a little tinfoil he said
[47:15] between he said a light passed from one
[47:17] hand to another in divine healing when
[47:19] the when the person was healed by the
[47:21] prayer of faith you have something
[47:24] inside of you that can pass one to
[47:25] another people said I to be nice to them
[47:32] but you do because we're not going to
[47:35] heaven with just you and Jesus we're
[47:36] going to heaven with one another so we
[47:39] have to learn to love one another that's
[47:41] what Paul's teaching the people here in
[47:42] barns notes you said be ye kind one to
[47:44] another which means to be mild courteous
[47:47] or polite back home some of the boys
[47:51] somebody was a critic one time to me and
[47:54] said why you like him boys do - and
[47:56] glorify God I said I'd like to get him
[47:59] just to open the door for the girls
[48:00] first I said we'll work on shot and
[48:05] repenting later if I can just get him to
[48:07] pull their seed out and offer to a
[48:08] sister that's happened to stand around
[48:11] be courteous be polite this is real
[48:14] Christianity people don't want to hear
[48:17] your brother random stuff but if you're
[48:19] nice to him they'll listen to you if
[48:22] you're nice to him they'll they'll
[48:24] respect you most people I know there's
[48:27] people in this world wouldn't respect
[48:28] God if he was standing right in front of
[48:29] them with a million dollars they would
[48:31] spit in the face of God of God offering
[48:33] eternal life on a silver platter I
[48:35] realized that I realized there are
[48:36] people in this world that I like yet I
[48:38] realize that no matter what you do
[48:41] you're gonna have the evil amongst you
[48:42] like the poor you'll always have the
[48:44] evil amongst our bodies are changed but
[48:47] as a Christian my responsibility is to
[48:49] be courteous to people to be nice to be
[48:53] polite to people oh my what do you think
[48:58] they're gonna see first how many quotes
[49:01] you have memorized or whether when a
[49:03] sister walks through the door they don't
[49:06] even have to be a sister just a woman
[49:07] you open up the door for I know brothers
[49:12] this is turning y'all upside down
[49:13] probably glory to God I got a lot to
[49:15] work on him
[49:16] but this is what being a Christian is
[49:18] all about they'll see your politeness
[49:20] and your courteousness before they'll
[49:22] see anything else
[49:23] do you also realize that one of the
[49:25] biggest complaints that people from the
[49:27] outside have about people in this
[49:29] message
[49:29] nobody's nice to him I've lost count of
[49:33] the times I've heard people leave a
[49:34] message search and their very words was
[49:36] nothing about doctrine nothing about
[49:38] disagreeing over revelation but people
[49:41] just went nice to me at that church they
[49:43] went on about their own business nobody
[49:45] would even talk to us nobody fellowship
[49:46] with us nobody her hand was in the
[49:49] hospital X amount of days nobody even
[49:50] called us come on somebody
[49:52] this is Christianity yeah you're getting
[49:56] quiet on me now hallelujah must be
[49:58] hitting the bull's eye praise the Lord
[50:01] Almighty
[50:01] this is Christianity we talk about
[50:04] Christianity but we put in parentheses
[50:06] to it all the great revelations that we
[50:08] believe put them on the bottom part and
[50:12] next to Christianity start putting in
[50:14] parentheses kindness courteousness
[50:17] politeness we raise our kids to say yes
[50:22] ma'am and no ma'am yes sir oh no sir not
[50:25] if I was to say hey Jesse what that's
[50:29] the day and age were living in a friend
[50:32] of Samantha's come over from Austin and
[50:34] we were sitting at the table and she
[50:36] looked at Sam she said you Americans the
[50:38] rudest people ever seen him ha ha she
[50:40] said how come she said ain't nobody ever
[50:42] says yes ma'am no ma'am sir ma'am what
[50:45] what huh
[50:50] but we raised our people to be polite to
[50:53] be courteous you're the prophet of God
[50:57] start a service when he says ma sure
[51:01] like that good singing I heard out there
[51:03] on up for some people that's far oh
[51:06] there are realms of Christianity but
[51:09] don't forget these are the who are the
[51:12] the ages
[51:13] that's who Paul was talking to be nice
[51:17] be polite courteous si goes to prove us
[51:21] deep people we need this too
[51:28] practical applications bender odd a man
[51:31] that's what this is glory because what
[51:36] do you think causes problems in the
[51:37] church between married folk I don't
[51:40] never down and talk to married people
[51:42] and the man said over in one corner the
[51:44] woman's and I said what's the matter
[51:46] since he got start on his fan of Godhead
[51:51] I've never had a man look at me and say
[51:54] that woman don't even understand their
[51:56] opening of the seventh seal but a
[52:00] hundred times out of a hundred you know
[52:02] it comes out of their mouth I can't even
[52:04] get him say I look pretty anymore I
[52:07] can't even get him to compliment my
[52:09] dress every time I do you huh on the
[52:13] other side sis you don't give him a
[52:14] chance to compliment it either oh god it
[52:18] getting quiet Jesse hallelujah hoping
[52:21] poor folks on the internet still holiday
[52:23] man when they get this come on now you
[52:27] think holds the glue that holds
[52:28] marriages and things together it's
[52:31] transparent Christian character it holds
[52:34] it together you know how many preachers
[52:35] I that have lost their families
[52:38] tremendous speakers charismatic speak to
[52:42] thousands at a time control their
[52:44] attention and put the ayats into a
[52:46] frenzy and lose their family because
[52:49] they were so concerned over their
[52:51] preaching that they didn't stop to be a
[52:53] father and stop to be a husband this is
[52:58] what Paul saying friends whether you can
[53:00] understand it or not be courteous be
[53:02] polite this is the foundation of what
[53:04] makes us the kind of people we are your
[53:08] rest of the world ain't going to operate
[53:09] this way and if they do they might be
[53:12] nice people but there's an end to that
[53:14] but for a Christian when they're bitter
[53:17] against you and they're mean against you
[53:18] in this macho on one cheek by the Holy
[53:20] Ghost baptism you still have the ability
[53:23] to turn your other cheek to these people
[53:25] you still have the ability to pray for
[53:28] them to despitefully use you and
[53:29] persecute you because it's a child of
[53:31] God Oh over to go its way inside of you
[53:35] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[53:37] you got a well you can draw from you got
[53:41] a source you can pull from hey first
[53:46] peter 3:8 there's a there's a version
[53:48] here and i'd like to read you from but
[53:52] look here first peter 3:8 read it in the
[53:55] King James and I want to read you this
[53:56] other in here I'm closing just a little
[53:59] bit I see the time I know we got lunch
[54:01] and then service again so I'm gonna try
[54:02] not to hold long I'll do my own
[54:04] preaching tonight but stay going just
[54:08] cuz I said that now finally be ye all of
[54:10] one Oh what oh my god you talk about
[54:15] miracles to get me in you in the same
[54:19] mind you like cherry pie and I like
[54:21] apple pie you like blue and I like green
[54:25] you're already scrunching your faces how
[54:30] how is God going to get us in this kind
[54:32] of condition it's gonna take the Holy
[54:34] Ghost to bring us into such a state of
[54:37] loving one another and kindness and
[54:39] politeness one to another that we are
[54:42] gonna be able to make this scripture
[54:43] live we may not all agree with our
[54:45] carnal thoughts our thoughts
[54:47] merged but if you practice this kind of
[54:50] idea a big kind one to another even if
[54:53] you bitterly disagree you can still be
[54:55] of one mind listen that's what God said
[54:59] he said if you can't better just agree
[55:02] with a man and still love him he said
[55:03] you need to go pray up I'm paraphrasing
[55:05] but that's the idea you ought to be able
[55:08] to love somebody that disagrees with you
[55:10] this is how we get in one mind having
[55:14] compassion one of another
[55:16] love is brethren be pitiful be my
[55:25] goodness I don't see any Seventh Seal in
[55:28] there brother Jesse I don't see any
[55:30] thunders but this this is Bible
[55:42] scriptures given uh huh wonder wonder
[55:50] why he's preaching this to converted
[55:53] people because how of the world gonna
[55:55] know you're converted if you lack hey
[56:00] that's just the rubber meets the road
[56:02] how are you gonna know you're converted
[56:04] if you don't have this right here if
[56:06] something and you don't change and you
[56:08] don't have this feelings were all
[56:10] humanity how do you even know you're
[56:11] converted just hide I love God I love
[56:15] you and not just love you when you're
[56:19] loving me but love you when you don't
[56:20] love me will preach brother V and I
[56:26] think I will right this is said the
[56:30] translation Christian will produce a
[56:32] true courteousness and politeness it
[56:35] does not make one rough crabbed or sour
[56:40] that's what I said all over the world I
[56:43] said man people want everybody's shot
[56:45] run speak in tongues see visions I said
[56:47] I just want to get him smiling first if
[56:51] I can get to church to the smilin stage
[56:53] I think we're in good shape
[56:56] principle the most unhappy message
[56:59] people are some of those that unhappy
[57:02] people ever met my life hey come to
[57:04] church even preach to Humber now and
[57:06] they don't smile once and the longer you
[57:11] go the worse that expression gets I
[57:15] don't know I couldn't get my face that
[57:17] long as long as I've seen some people
[57:19] get it but Christianity should produce
[57:23] joy
[57:25] hey man it should produce something our
[57:29] hearts go over to God that produced my
[57:32] face that the world sees our salvation
[57:35] hey man hey man how do I know that what
[57:39] you gots good for them if it's made you
[57:41] look like that
[57:45] lordy God I'm a Christian don't you want
[57:48] what I want good god no it might be
[57:50] contagious
[57:54] no wonder young people in this message
[57:57] have run from this message because they
[57:59] don't see the joy the politeness the
[58:03] courteousness they don't see those
[58:05] Christian qualities existing amongst the
[58:08] people that they call mom and dad if you
[58:15] don't see it they're friends I don't
[58:17] know where I don't know where else you
[58:18] could see it another writer said the
[58:23] secret of true politeness is benevolence
[58:25] a desire to make others happy
[58:30] amen well it's always made me happy but
[58:36] if you're a Christian you are concerned
[58:38] with the happiness of your brother not
[58:43] yourself but your brother there's no
[58:47] religion matthew henry says that is sad
[58:49] glory to god misanthropic temper how
[58:54] about a ten barrel wert not in rudeness
[58:56] stiffness repulsiveness
[58:59] and none violating the rules of good
[59:01] breeding ha ha Laurie that's what we
[59:05] need some good breeding around the
[59:06] message teach people how to be like
[59:09] ladies and gentlemen some of the most
[59:14] rude and arrogant people I've ever met
[59:16] were people that called William Branham
[59:19] the Elijah prophet of this hour hi
[59:22] because that's the kind of devil that
[59:25] will hide around the ranks of truth like
[59:26] this and if he gets the world so be it
[59:30] but if he can sour the whole apple bunch
[59:32] and a message that's got the biggest
[59:33] brightest apples that's ever been given
[59:35] well then he's accomplished something
[59:37] then
[59:38] I just did a we redid an interview I
[59:41] don't know how many saw the interview on
[59:43] YouTube
[59:44] Lilly Columbus her name you can't see it
[59:47] on the on the first take we did my wife
[59:50] is sitting right there next to looks
[59:52] like I'm in a room with this girl I told
[59:53] her I said we're gonna fix that Lilly
[59:55] but I did this she asked me a question
[59:59] and she told me she said I'm not gonna
[1:00:01] tell you what the question is we're just
[1:00:03] gonna go at it that's okay so we sat
[1:00:06] down and she asked me the question or
[1:00:07] women underestimated in this message
[1:00:10] anybody see the interview I use this
[1:00:13] this terminology I said matter of fact I
[1:00:15] said some people bully women in this
[1:00:18] message I've lost count of the people
[1:00:22] that have come to me and grabbed me by
[1:00:23] the hand men and women I like brother
[1:00:25] bin if there ever was truth that's it
[1:00:28] because it's true you come to the house
[1:00:30] of God us and some of you women have
[1:00:31] been sitting here all these years you
[1:00:33] haven't put a pair of scissors in your
[1:00:34] hand to cut your hair you wore pants and
[1:00:37] makeup and on and on and on but yet you
[1:00:39] come to the house of God and what's the
[1:00:40] first thing the preacher starts we'll
[1:00:41] hammering and beating on women cutting
[1:00:44] their hair as bullying friends it's
[1:00:46] bullying a woman wants to grow and
[1:00:49] develop in the character of Jesus Christ
[1:00:51] just like us men do I think we should
[1:00:54] respect our sisters and preach to them
[1:00:56] preach to them things that will bring
[1:00:58] them up in Christianity if a woman ain't
[1:01:01] got no more revelation to quit cutting
[1:01:03] her hair you beaten her heading Omega
[1:01:04] stop it a man the Holy Spirit has to
[1:01:11] make him stop it what good does it do to
[1:01:13] bring him to church every time they walk
[1:01:15] through the doors yeah yes and you put
[1:01:20] him in a place of submission sure but
[1:01:22] put him where God put him
[1:01:23] don't drive him down and make him a
[1:01:25] bunch of doormats I had a woman that
[1:01:33] left over the believe the sign move she
[1:01:36] wrote me after that interview she said
[1:01:39] brother band I just finished watching
[1:01:40] your interview about how we should
[1:01:43] respond to the believe the sign people
[1:01:45] you know my answer to was be nice to him
[1:01:48] don't
[1:01:50] I had message preachers look at me as a
[1:01:55] hot new are you talking about
[1:01:57] I said don't fight him don't be mean to
[1:02:01] him they left for a reason there's a
[1:02:03] reason they left a young one one young
[1:02:06] sister write me and she said brother Ben
[1:02:08] she said I don't agree with you and you
[1:02:10] don't agree with me she said I do not
[1:02:13] believe brother Brown was a prophet I
[1:02:14] said fine whatever they don't matter to
[1:02:16] me no skin off my teeth you'd you don't
[1:02:19] have to eat Paul was an apostle I don't
[1:02:20] care what you believe that's up to you
[1:02:22] I'm not called a God to make you believe
[1:02:24] nothing I'm called a God to preach you
[1:02:25] can believe it or not it's up to you she
[1:02:29] wrote me back and she said I've never
[1:02:31] met a message preacher like you
[1:02:33] she said all these other guys they tell
[1:02:36] me I'm going to hell that I blaspheme
[1:02:37] the Holy Ghost she said I watched your
[1:02:40] interview and you're actually saying be
[1:02:41] nice to us you're the first message
[1:02:45] preacher and this girl come from a
[1:02:46] prominent area that ever even made such
[1:02:49] a remark and I said to myself how sad
[1:02:52] that is when we should be the ones when
[1:02:56] we see people leaving the message and me
[1:02:57] and discouraged and we should be the
[1:02:59] ones to reach our hands out and say look
[1:03:01] brother you may you may have been
[1:03:04] mishandled you may have been mistreated
[1:03:05] we redid this interview on the boolean
[1:03:08] and I mean I went after a hundred miles
[1:03:10] an hour
[1:03:10] I said Lily we're gonna do this
[1:03:12] interview better my wife is gonna be in
[1:03:13] the picture this time and we redid this
[1:03:16] interview and I made this remark I said
[1:03:19] many of you people remember this to go
[1:03:20] on that youtuber to go around the world
[1:03:22] when she posted ain't no telling how
[1:03:23] many places will go and I made this
[1:03:26] remark I said a lot of the people have
[1:03:28] left this semester's they had in their
[1:03:30] mind it's because they were mistreated
[1:03:32] and there was nobody good and this sat
[1:03:34] in the other I said you people out there
[1:03:36] you ain't never come talk to me or talk
[1:03:39] to this little woman sitting here next
[1:03:40] to me
[1:03:41] I said because not all of us men in this
[1:03:43] message think our wives are dog meat in
[1:03:45] doormats
[1:03:46] I said there's some of us that respect
[1:03:48] real women a real one the prophet of God
[1:03:53] said a real lady he said well what man
[1:03:55] would give a drop of blood he's got to
[1:03:57] defend her honor
[1:04:00] a little woman but preaching like that
[1:04:05] it ain't gonna get me into big
[1:04:06] conventions but it's needed more now
[1:04:09] than has ever been needed before because
[1:04:13] nothing against revelation nothing
[1:04:15] against opening the word nothing against
[1:04:16] thunders and seals but what we need in
[1:04:19] the ranks of this message is we need an
[1:04:20] old-fashioned baptism of these
[1:04:23] principles right here how to be
[1:04:26] courteous how to be polite how to be
[1:04:28] nice one to another how to speak sweetly
[1:04:31] with people how to make everybody else
[1:04:33] happy instead of looking at ourself all
[1:04:35] the time right listen to this I've read
[1:04:40] to you some lot of these commentaries
[1:04:41] one reason I do that is III know people
[1:04:44] hear things in different ways and I like
[1:04:45] the different approaches but let's read
[1:04:48] from Elijah for just one full week
[1:04:49] before we quit for the afternoon
[1:04:50] flashing red light remember said one of
[1:04:52] the most miserable things Oh God now
[1:04:56] what he's getting ready to tell us is
[1:04:57] going to be worse than cancer because
[1:05:00] this is a man who's seen all kinds of
[1:05:03] enters of diseases you name it brother
[1:05:05] Branham says get ready tell us one of
[1:05:07] the most miserable things you won't know
[1:05:10] what it is a man or woman who's just
[1:05:14] lived an old Mossback church member
[1:05:18] never accepted Christ meaner than Satan
[1:05:21] himself setting out with some old crabs
[1:05:23] something on him he says this is a man's
[1:05:28] been up against witch doctors this is a
[1:05:30] man who has seen all kinds of crippling
[1:05:32] diseases from leprosy to you name it
[1:05:34] this is a man who has seen people's
[1:05:36] noses eat off because of cancer he saw
[1:05:38] their bodies wasted emaciated wait until
[1:05:41] they're just skeletons and he said the
[1:05:43] worst most miserable thing he's ever saw
[1:05:46] was somebody as a church member with a
[1:05:49] crabbed old spirit on them oh god I
[1:05:52] should have the altar right now that's
[1:05:59] the harmless crown that Satan can crown
[1:06:02] a life with think of this now this is
[1:06:07] June of 63 seals are open
[1:06:10] thunders have sounded and yet brother
[1:06:15] branham is still feeling the need to
[1:06:17] talk this way to people he said the
[1:06:23] horriblest crown satan could crown of
[1:06:24] life with he said a grouchy old woman
[1:06:26] about 60 or 70 years old fat hanging
[1:06:28] down underneath their arms in wrinkles
[1:06:31] all over her face her hair bobbed up
[1:06:33] four or five different colors strutting
[1:06:34] with a pair of little shorts on if that
[1:06:36] ain't the crowning of satan I've never
[1:06:37] seen it some old crab in man he said he
[1:06:40] said I've got to die said I hope that
[1:06:41] God never let Satan cram in with an old
[1:06:43] crab in different man my wife an old
[1:06:46] nagging woman or your wife that way I
[1:06:48] pray brethren let our lives be crowned
[1:06:50] with the fruits of the spirit love joy
[1:06:54] long-suffering gentleness patience truth
[1:07:00] faith in the Holy Spirit on a scale
[1:07:06] what's greater when you learn the
[1:07:09] revelation and you learn the seals
[1:07:11] you've learned them you don't go back
[1:07:13] over it once God revealed to me about
[1:07:16] the thunders that's always been a
[1:07:17] revelation to me once I understood the
[1:07:20] Seventh Seal I've understood it once I
[1:07:22] knew water baptism I was baptized that
[1:07:24] was the end of it once I understood the
[1:07:27] Godhead I never just struggle with
[1:07:29] trinitarianism but I do wrestle with
[1:07:32] bitterness I do wrestle with unhappiness
[1:07:35] I do wrestle with anger I do wrestle
[1:07:39] with these other things you understand
[1:07:40] what I'm saying these are the things
[1:07:42] that you'll deal with every day of your
[1:07:43] life so if you're going to put it on a
[1:07:45] scale which one's more valuable well I
[1:07:52] didn't come to yell at you but I come to
[1:07:54] get us somewhere if we're gonna get
[1:07:57] there if we just listen to the word the
[1:07:58] word will teach us uniting time inside
[1:08:01] remember said I don't say much about it
[1:08:02] you know who said around people
[1:08:03] complaining but I think one of the most
[1:08:05] horrible things is to see a man and
[1:08:07] woman constantly complaining I've always
[1:08:10] said God keep me that weakens faith all
[1:08:13] the time Wow complaining weakens faith
[1:08:20] he said you know each one of us is going
[1:08:22] to get older something's gonna happen he
[1:08:25] said sure little things are going to
[1:08:26] keep accumulating as you get older
[1:08:30] they've got to listen but I think one of
[1:08:35] the most horriblest things is for satan
[1:08:39] to crown some person's life a crabbit
[1:08:43] old man or woman I hope I don't get to
[1:08:47] that place I hope I can bear my burdens
[1:08:49] get to a spot I want my life crown with
[1:08:52] the glory of God
[1:08:53] long-suffering gentleness peace meekness
[1:08:56] filled with the Holy Spirit think about
[1:08:59] that that a person could come to a space
[1:09:03] time is going to render circumstances
[1:09:06] time is going to take us in a direction
[1:09:09] of experiences and the older we get the
[1:09:12] more we're gonna have so what Satan's
[1:09:17] greatest weapon gonna be against some of
[1:09:19] us not that secret website that starts
[1:09:22] talking about the trinitarianism or that
[1:09:27] text message from that former believer
[1:09:29] that's it
[1:09:29] have you seen the bridge that angle
[1:09:32] effect half-up have us won't even
[1:09:35] probably give it a second thought but
[1:09:41] say after about a year of one thing
[1:09:42] after another after another after
[1:09:44] another and the middle of the night the
[1:09:47] devil says some wrong view well you may
[1:09:55] not I'm a Christian yeah but views a
[1:09:57] Christian would but all this be
[1:09:59] happening to you look at some solitaire
[1:10:01] don't happen to them look at brother
[1:10:03] so-and-so but just as sudden the devil
[1:10:05] puts on me all the time because I preach
[1:10:08] the gospel holiness bare fisted look at
[1:10:11] something so how he's blessed so-and-so
[1:10:13] asked him to preach so-and-so invites
[1:10:16] him over to such and such in such place
[1:10:17] what about you I don't mean this
[1:10:21] arrogantly but by the time my pastor
[1:10:24] retired January 7th by January 8th my
[1:10:28] schedule is all the way out here -
[1:10:29] brother Jesse's right here I got
[1:10:32] String a meeting I'm working on the rest
[1:10:34] of the year I'll finish the year out in
[1:10:36] just a few weeks time and Satan come to
[1:10:39] me in the middle of the night and tell
[1:10:39] me he don't ever say to me you're doing
[1:10:43] a good work for the Lord God's really
[1:10:45] been blessing you boy you're helping
[1:10:48] people everywhere you go he don't ever
[1:10:49] tell me that but he always tells me
[1:10:52] about you know this may come to an end
[1:10:55] for you one day people get tired that
[1:10:58] kind of preaching you do I'm gonna want
[1:11:00] you back and their churches no more it's
[1:11:03] amazing that he don't come to me and say
[1:11:06] Jesus is really the second person of the
[1:11:08] Trinity I've never had the devil meet me
[1:11:12] in the middle of the night and say you
[1:11:14] baptized right but he works on that side
[1:11:18] of my mind
[1:11:21] wonder what so him so thinks about you
[1:11:23] wonder what so-and-so thought so-and-so
[1:11:26] talk to him you know they did and they
[1:11:27] said such and such and so and so and so
[1:11:29] and in the middle of the night you got
[1:11:33] all this working on your mind you know
[1:11:36] the devil is trying to do he's trying to
[1:11:38] offer you a boysenberry
[1:11:41] I know Disney misses at 90% of the time
[1:11:46] but that witch with the Apple in her
[1:11:47] hand she did have some truth give me
[1:11:54] right
[1:11:58] closing brother branham said in
[1:12:01] speak to the rock you said the
[1:12:02] Israelites cut off their spiritual
[1:12:05] supply through carnality
[1:12:12] that's what Paul was trying to keep him
[1:12:14] out of carnality what destroys a church
[1:12:18] carnality yes
[1:12:20] it ain't that God wouldn't come bless us
[1:12:22] in all of our mistakes and all of our
[1:12:24] misgivings listen I don't go to school
[1:12:26] to learn how to do what I'm doing right
[1:12:28] now if I do it wrong it's because I'm
[1:12:32] ignorant don't know how to do it right
[1:12:33] yet come on somebody and nobody teaches
[1:12:38] you how to be the right congregants
[1:12:39] either it about to go to school to be
[1:12:42] the right kind of message person anybody
[1:12:44] I think I'm thinking about seriously
[1:12:46] starting to school though I'll tell you
[1:12:47] that right now first place I'm all start
[1:12:51] as Amen classicist releasing worship 101
[1:13:00] with Jesse and I'm hiring you and Sam to
[1:13:03] help me teach because your teachers but
[1:13:11] carnality what ruins it not not that you
[1:13:18] and I played this thing a thousand times
[1:13:19] and made 10,000 mistakes on it played it
[1:13:25] in the wrong key played it in their own
[1:13:26] tempo I made a bunch of mistakes playing
[1:13:28] this morning I get my eyes closed and
[1:13:31] get the worst but I'm not going to
[1:13:32] looking at my fingers and I'll hit every
[1:13:34] wrong key in the book and believe me I
[1:13:36] don't like doing that when you got a guy
[1:13:38] like him sitting in the congregation but
[1:13:45] that ain't what stopped the Holy Spirit
[1:13:46] from coming on me no he blessed me this
[1:13:49] morning while I was singing I hope you
[1:13:52] were blessed but I got blessed I felt
[1:13:54] his presence I know Sam was trying but
[1:13:57] she was doing her part sure but it
[1:14:00] didn't have nothing to do no no I me I
[1:14:03] sat down there and played with all my
[1:14:05] mistakes and I me
[1:14:08] not y'all me I got blessed sitting there
[1:14:11] playing this morning God didn't
[1:14:14] the blessing cuz I hit a wrong note
[1:14:16] every now and then but what would mess
[1:14:21] it up or analogy trying to outdo the
[1:14:26] next guy trying to be too perfect trying
[1:14:31] to do things for show carnality what
[1:14:35] ruins it if you got a guy up here
[1:14:37] leading singing so you walk out
[1:14:40] lord have mercy he was in twelve
[1:14:43] different keys
[1:14:46] god bless today how what ruins it
[1:14:50] carnality such-and-such church over
[1:14:55] there has got a real song leader Jessie
[1:14:57] I'm throwing off for you I'm just using
[1:14:59] examples they got a gather and he can
[1:15:02] sing in all twelve keys and he holds his
[1:15:04] pitch and he knows how to get her done
[1:15:11] but maybe God don't want that guy over
[1:15:13] here maybe God wants it just like it is
[1:15:18] I'll admit
[1:15:20] Samantha put a little thing on Facebook
[1:15:22] I got to laugh because people are so
[1:15:25] silly you'll have to forgive me if I'm
[1:15:27] stiff I ran a mile the other day my sore
[1:15:29] all over my body my girls have been
[1:15:33] laughing at me for three days I get
[1:15:34] hardly walk this whole thing this guy
[1:15:40] was trying to sing looking for a city
[1:15:41] Brian free they go up up up up up up and
[1:15:45] it is the god awful of Smiths you've
[1:15:46] ever heard in your life and it wouldn't
[1:15:48] have been a problem if the guy hadn't
[1:15:49] started bragging when he got started I
[1:15:51] took on mr. free and made him give up
[1:15:54] and I've been asked to sing his heart
[1:15:56] out of the country I just got to
[1:15:58] laughing I said people are silly and
[1:16:02] this boy he's a good kid he's got a
[1:16:04] sense of humor too he laughs at himself
[1:16:06] somebody wrote on a he's trying to do
[1:16:09] something for God and God's been blessed
[1:16:11] by it I thought how silly people can be
[1:16:14] its carnality it's obvious the kid can't
[1:16:18] sing it's obviously don't know how to
[1:16:20] sing he know and everybody listening to
[1:16:23] it knows it but just like elbows
[1:16:27] everybody's got an opinion
[1:16:28] and carnality starts tearing the church
[1:16:31] apart this is why Paul said keep that
[1:16:36] stuff out of these churches don't be
[1:16:39] Arnel like that if a man can't sing or a
[1:16:42] woman can't sing don't boast yourself
[1:16:45] like you can and if you can really
[1:16:49] really really really really really sing
[1:16:50] don't put down the ones that can be
[1:16:56] encouraging one to another uplift one
[1:16:59] another build people up be you kind one
[1:17:06] to another you stammer coming from
[1:17:18] somebody that's take it on mister free
[1:17:20] he's tough looks like a man sings like a
[1:17:27] girl that's what a tenor singer is I
[1:17:29] used to do it brother Jesse I could
[1:17:33] crack glass I could sing so high I loved
[1:17:36] it and I would get in that room of mine
[1:17:41] I had a little damp with a microphone
[1:17:44] and I turn on him gospel tapes mine I
[1:17:47] didn't know all them years he was
[1:17:49] listening to me but he was and I get it
[1:17:52] and sing with him tanners boy and let me
[1:17:56] tell you something it wasn't it was bad
[1:18:01] because there would be times I couldn't
[1:18:03] reach the note and I'm squealing and
[1:18:05] squawking and carrying on it's awful
[1:18:07] god-awful mess you ever heard in your
[1:18:09] life can't get it done but you I can't
[1:18:16] lost count of the times that I get a
[1:18:19] nurse singing like that and hold of
[1:18:20] spirit come in the room because I wasn't
[1:18:28] mean I'm trying to teach you something
[1:18:32] if you're listening close that's what
[1:18:35] kills our walk with God quicker than
[1:18:37] anything else
[1:18:38] carnality now if you go do something for
[1:18:41] God do the best you can
[1:18:42] you're gonna sing be the best thing you
[1:18:45] can go and play be the best player don't
[1:18:46] get in ruts move on break things up I
[1:18:51] tell people you worship God in church
[1:18:53] you raise your left hand all the time
[1:18:54] put the left now put your right one up
[1:18:56] every now and then if you come to church
[1:18:58] say Amen amen amen said glory glory
[1:19:00] glory next time then next time
[1:19:02] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah me and
[1:19:05] Jesse we're hand clappers I like to clap
[1:19:07] my hands so but every now and then I get
[1:19:09] in a rut with head yes so you know what
[1:19:11] I do
[1:19:11] I don't just clap my hands I jump up my
[1:19:13] leg this thing to keep getting stuck in
[1:19:17] a rut because as people that have been
[1:19:21] freed by this Holy Spirit message we are
[1:19:24] not under bondage anymore we should not
[1:19:28] be under the bondage of carnality Amen
[1:19:33] listen this I'm closing brother Branham
[1:19:36] said that's what's the matter with the
[1:19:38] churches the wreaths a fuss the reach
[1:19:41] they quarrel the reason they stir so
[1:19:46] called Christians because they bypassed
[1:19:48] the land of blessing the fountain that
[1:19:50] never runs dry he said people come in
[1:19:53] carnal a bunch of holy rollers days of
[1:19:56] miracles has passed no such thing as
[1:19:57] those things he said but let him come to
[1:19:59] the water one time he says like an old
[1:20:02] plant he said there's anything I hate he
[1:20:04] says Arizona an old hot desert but he
[1:20:09] said on that cactus he said there's a
[1:20:10] sticker on it but that sticker at one
[1:20:13] time was a flower it just lacks water
[1:20:17] you know what it looks like when an old
[1:20:20] flower dries up it goes from being like
[1:20:23] this to being like this
[1:20:30] what happened to him
[1:20:32] carnality cut off the flow of the
[1:20:35] blessings let him get to the water one
[1:20:38] time it won't just open up their hands
[1:20:40] like this but it'll open up their
[1:20:43] attitude it'll open up their feeling
[1:20:46] it'll open up all these things that
[1:20:49] makes us Christians in the sight of God
[1:20:53] I know I know people my daddy my mama
[1:21:00] yeah a hundred miles night that's where
[1:21:02] I get it my daddy just sits and grins
[1:21:04] he don't hardly say two words I put all
[1:21:08] over the country of my dad going from
[1:21:10] one meeting to another to another
[1:21:11] he might say three words every time in
[1:21:13] the car I said y'all right you did okay
[1:21:15] yeah that's about all she wrote yeah I
[1:21:18] mean you did good out of it got a nature
[1:21:22] about him he's got a way about him and I
[1:21:26] realize that what we go to church not
[1:21:28] every time we went to church I didn't
[1:21:29] expect to see my daddy rollin in the
[1:21:31] floor or screaming amen and hallelujah
[1:21:36] but you know something interesting that
[1:21:39] quiet man he's 83 now I hope God gives
[1:21:44] him a lot of years I'd hate to lose him
[1:21:46] but it hadn't been good the last couple
[1:21:49] of years has health been bad but I
[1:21:52] remember when he would have flop in the
[1:21:54] floor like a fish after the Holy Ghost
[1:21:57] would strike him speaking in tongues
[1:21:59] shouting in the spirit something
[1:22:03] contrary to nature carnality will always
[1:22:08] allow you to go along with your own
[1:22:10] carnal ways but the Holy Spirit
[1:22:13] sometimes will call you to do things
[1:22:15] different I'm not talking about if
[1:22:17] you're a quiet person you're gonna start
[1:22:19] screaming tomorrow but I mean sometimes
[1:22:21] if you're an isolated type person more
[1:22:23] of an of an introvert the Holy Spirit
[1:22:26] might make you open up that hand just to
[1:22:28] shake hands and be friendly one to
[1:22:31] another because I sometimes friends we
[1:22:34] want to see the hands go this way but in
[1:22:36] churches I like to see them go this way
[1:22:38] too
[1:22:40] praise Lord I'm quitting I know I've
[1:22:42] done said it 40 times but I am quitting
[1:22:44] but this is what Paul is trying to tell
[1:22:47] him be ye kind one to another God help
[1:22:52] me Lord help me Jesus help me to be able
[1:22:56] to live what was pronounced in in words
[1:22:58] over 2,000 years ago help me make it
[1:23:01] live Lord let's pray together Lord Jesus
[1:23:06] father I want to thank you for the
[1:23:08] message this morning Lord it's been a
[1:23:10] really in-depth a lot of simple things
[1:23:14] in here but Lord at the same time a lot
[1:23:17] of important things I just pray you'll
[1:23:20] help us with this help us be able to
[1:23:24] receive everything you placed in this
[1:23:28] word this morning god help us to look at
[1:23:37] things in a certain light because Lord
[1:23:42] sometimes I think my mind I get so
[1:23:47] focused on one thing see it a certain
[1:23:50] way Lord if you'll change my view and
[1:23:53] let me see it in that certain light that
[1:23:54] right Holy Light and Lord the thing I've
[1:23:59] been looking at all these years becomes
[1:24:01] a complete different thing altogether
[1:24:05] Lord sometimes that ain't that we mean
[1:24:07] to be this way it's just we're just not
[1:24:09] seeing it right but God help us as your
[1:24:12] children help us to be courteous to be
[1:24:15] polite
[1:24:16] help us to examine our own ways our own
[1:24:20] attitudes our own behaviors and help us

[1:24:44] wouldn't even speak back he's a meaty
[1:24:46] speak to that woman talk to you what was
[1:24:49] it Lord as a nature it was just
[1:24:50] something built into that human probe
[1:24:53] hey Lord maybe I'm sure sister Minnie
[1:24:55] probably didn't mean to do it like that
[1:24:57] it's why brother BAM is telling about it
[1:24:59] Lord we look at our own selves do we do
[1:25:03] things just because it's what feels
[1:25:05] comfortable for us or God are we doing
[1:25:10] things because we just don't want to do
[1:25:12] it exact hey lord I pray that you'll
[1:25:20] help me not to let my own nature dictate
[1:25:25] how I live as a Christian let the nature
