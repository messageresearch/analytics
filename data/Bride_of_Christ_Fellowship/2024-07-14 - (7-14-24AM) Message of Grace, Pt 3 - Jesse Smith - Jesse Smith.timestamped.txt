[0:00] three I believe if you haven't listened
[0:02] to it I really encourage you to listen
[0:03] to it it's a just a very special
[0:07] message it's a thorough teaching on
[0:09] God's grace and uh I just surely enjoyed
[0:13] it I trust you have as well and hope you
[0:16] enjoyed the review of zerubabel on
[0:17] Wednesday night was that a good review
[0:19] hopefully everybody enjoyed that one and
[0:21] um good message there by God's grace and
[0:24] remember we ended with 1 Timothy 1:14
[0:27] and the grace of our Lord was
[0:28] exceedingly abundant with faith and love
[0:32] which is in Christ Jesus so just a
[0:34] reminder that you know God gives us
[0:35] Grace and through that Grace he gives us
[0:38] also faith and he gives us love praise
[0:41] God so we're thankful for God's Amazing
[0:45] Grace uh it's God's gift that did it to
[0:48] us and he's giving us uh Grace just as
[0:50] we need it
[0:55] Hallelujah now brother R uh now working
[1:00] I'm I'm in paragraph 60 so I'm going
[1:02] through you know I'm going to try to go
[1:03] chronological through the sermon here um
[1:07] and we just ended with the part where
[1:08] brother brand was talking about um
[1:11] finishing up his uh his uh experience
[1:14] with the three
[1:15] rainbows and uh he he said those three
[1:18] rainbows represented the godhead the
[1:20] father son Holy Ghost Jehovah of the Old
[1:22] Testament is Jesus Christ of the new and
[1:25] he said the same God that gave him the
[1:27] message of the godhead is the same God
[1:29] that gave him the right balance on Grace
[1:32] Hallelujah and that's what this message
[1:34] is it's it's the message of Jesus Christ
[1:36] Hallelujah so if anyone has a true
[1:38] understanding of Grace that's a church
[1:40] it ought to be our church it ought to be
[1:42] churches that have heard the ministry of
[1:43] God's Prophet brother Brandon because we
[1:46] in other words we accept every Bible
[1:48] verse on Grace we don't take it too far
[1:51] like the Calvinists you know they
[1:52] believe you can uh they believe you
[1:55] don't have to do any absolutely anything
[1:56] to be saved and and what what they're
[1:58] saying is no works are there's no works
[2:00] right you can have no works and still be
[2:03] saved well uh that that's going too far
[2:06] that's going too far uh you have to do
[2:08] something you have to repent Hallelujah
[2:11] you have to repent and accept it there's
[2:13] always been one provided way Hallelujah
[2:15] God's provided way is repentance and
[2:17] accepting salvation the human has to do
[2:19] something to be saved God can't force
[2:21] somebody to be saved
[2:23] Hallelujah so God gives us uh something
[2:26] to do and it begins with submitting our
[2:29] will and so we're thankful that we have
[2:31] the right balance by the grace of God
[2:34] and I think you know as message
[2:35] Believers I think we have to be careful
[2:37] not to go on the side of armenis like
[2:39] I'm only saved if I'm doing good works
[2:42] all the
[2:43] time right we have we have to because we
[2:47] know so much about justification
[2:48] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:50] talents gifts we know so much about that
[2:53] we hear so much of about it that the
[2:55] enemy will attack us and say well you
[2:57] haven't done enough this week you're
[2:58] probably not saved M right or you failed
[3:02] here how could you be
[3:03] saved you failed here how could you be
[3:05] justified how could you be Sanctified
[3:07] how could you be filled with the Holy
[3:09] Ghost see this say he's going to work on
[3:10] you either way that's why it's best just
[3:12] to praise God hallelujah like I was
[3:14] telling like when I preached on the the
[3:16] dancing you know you might as well dance
[3:18] you might as well praise God because
[3:19] Satan's going to attack you either way
[3:21] right that's why I told the Saints they
[3:22] enjoyed that thought out there in
[3:24] Kentucky either way you know either way
[3:25] he's going to bow to you the Bible said
[3:27] the the best part is when you do dance
[3:29] or when you do praise God or when you do
[3:31] worship uh the Bible said he inhabits
[3:34] that
[3:35] praise he in other words he's anointing
[3:38] you while you're doing that that's what
[3:39] I told one of those repentant Brothers I
[3:40] said I said when you do it you'll get
[3:42] the joy of the Lord back and then you'll
[3:43] be strong because the joy of the Lord is
[3:45] your strength
[3:48] amen so yes go ahead and praise God Amen
[3:51] recognize God's grace and enjoy that
[3:54] because and then you'll brother man said
[3:55] you'll live off that for a few days amen
[3:58] that's right he said he lived two weeks
[4:00] off of the future home imagine you wake
[4:01] up tomorrow oh future home and then
[4:04] imagine waking up Tuesday oh the future
[4:06] home you ever done that
[4:08] before that's quite a that's quite a
[4:10] thing you know you live off a revelation
[4:13] for a week or something that that's
[4:15] pretty awesome yeah I know I off that in
[4:17] appointing experience for at least a
[4:18] week I was like everyone wow thank you
[4:21] Lord amen God you're so close you're so
[4:23] wonderful amen you're so near to us
[4:26] hallelujah amen and so God uh you know
[4:29] God is encouraging us with
[4:31] Grace now um at this point in brother's
[4:35] sermon he's looking at himself a little
[4:37] more and comparing God's grace on his
[4:38] life because he's telling over this
[4:40] vision and he's seeing himself as a
[4:42] partial type of
[4:43] zerubabel zerubabel laid the foundation
[4:46] stone but then he was also going to lay
[4:48] The Headstone now brother random didn't
[4:49] lay the foundation stone Paul laid the
[4:51] foundation stone but brother randam did
[4:54] by God's grace he's laying this in other
[4:56] words he's pointing to the headstone The
[4:58] Headstone is Christ amen right and I'll
[5:01] say like this there's a couple of types
[5:02] there's two types for you the headstone
[5:04] is you getting the baptism of the Holy
[5:06] Ghost that's a headstone for you amen
[5:09] glory amen when there's a headstone
[5:11] we're all looking for that's the Rapture
[5:13] hallelujah amen see we could say brother
[5:16] laid The Headstone for the church other
[5:17] words he showed the church here's the
[5:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen right so
[5:23] and that that's one way brother Ram did
[5:24] Lay The Headstone but the other type is
[5:27] brother R's Ministry uh point us to
[5:30] Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ is
[5:32] coming back just like John the Baptist
[5:33] said Behold the Lamb of God who takes
[5:35] away the world or I'm sorry takes away
[5:37] the sin of the world brother Ram was
[5:38] saying Behold the Lamb of God he's
[5:40] coming back in the pre-tribulation
[5:41] Rapture hallelujah amen he was pointing
[5:44] to the headstone and I love it the shout
[5:46] was Grace Grace hallelujah amen amen
[5:50] amen when that squeeze begins coming on
[5:52] church we'll be shouting God grace thank
[5:54] we need God's grace amen we want to be
[5:57] ready by the grace of God see and if
[5:59] Grace caused the The Headstone to come
[6:01] there then Grace will cause this
[6:03] headstone to come as well amen it is
[6:06] God's Amazing Grace
[6:10] Hallelujah so brother is dealing with
[6:12] this you know he's starting now to get
[6:13] into some topics of Grace and just so
[6:15] you know here's brother ROM's here's the
[6:17] Bible characters brother random uses as
[6:19] I was studying yesterday I I found this
[6:22] this uh brother R basically went
[6:23] chronologically Through the Bible he
[6:25] started with Adam and Eve that's
[6:26] probably what we look at today then he
[6:27] went to Noah Abraham Israel as a nation
[6:31] Moses he spent the most time on David
[6:34] and if you haven't listened to the
[6:34] sermon and you like David you need to
[6:36] listen to the sermon because it's
[6:37] awesome about David he spends most of
[6:39] the time on David you know how could he
[6:40] do this with Bas Sheba yet God provided
[6:43] Grace it's it's beautiful and then he
[6:46] goes with a thief on the cross how he
[6:49] received Grace so if you want to see
[6:50] some beautiful uh preaching on Grace
[6:52] this is the sermon to listen to amen
[6:55] that's why we sing about it because it's
[6:57] a revelation from the Holy Ghost amen to
[7:00] God's prophet and God's Prophet gave it
[7:02] to us hallelujah he said just like I was
[7:05] given to God think about brother William
[7:06] just as he was given to godhead he was
[7:08] given this message of Grace amen and God
[7:11] Vindicated it with that vision of the
[7:13] three rainbows because what's a rainbow
[7:15] a covenant and what's a covenant it's a
[7:17] it's a promise of God's
[7:18] grace it's a promise I'm not going to
[7:20] leave you I'm not going to forsake you
[7:22] hallelujah amen I made a promise to you
[7:25] and I'm going to keep my promise
[7:27] hallelujah oh it's beautiful now brother
[7:29] R says this I'm going to start reading a
[7:31] few quotes and get down to some
[7:32] scriptures here by God's
[7:34] grace brother R said to think of him
[7:37] Jesus I was thinking of that Grace
[7:39] immediately after that Friday morning
[7:40] when he saw the three
[7:42] rainbows just at the break of day up
[7:44] there in the field where I sat on a log
[7:47] later and tears come down my eyes so
[7:50] here brother's crying after seeing the
[7:51] three rainbows and he says oh God Your
[7:54] Grace has
[7:55] stooped to save me why did you ever have
[7:59] such pity on a
[8:02] poor illiterate ratch like
[8:05] myself I like how brother was able to
[8:07] use some of these Bible words cuz Paul
[8:09] said oh Wretched Man that I
[8:11] am hallelujah amen and he was poor
[8:15] naturally now we if we're rich some of
[8:17] us most of us in America were raised
[8:18] Rich right as far as we have everything
[8:20] we need so we ought to be able to say
[8:22] Lord you had mercy on a
[8:25] literate how many can read brother man
[8:28] couldn't read very well he was
[8:29] illiterate so you you and I are like
[8:31] almost the opposite we're rich literate
[8:34] wretches might not it might not be easy
[8:37] for you accept that at first but that's
[8:38] the truth amen I don't care if you could
[8:41] read or what I don't care how smart you
[8:42] are if you're living in sin you are rich
[8:44] amen that's right and God's Amazing
[8:47] Grace came to you it came to me to save
[8:49] us miserable Rich literate wretches
[8:53] hallelujah amen hallelujah we're no
[8:56] better fact
[8:59] Bible said the Bible says Lea was an
[9:02] awful time Jesus didn't give Le DEA one
[9:04] compliment praise
[9:06] God and so you know we can't say we're
[9:08] better off or something like that yes
[9:10] there's more Revelation given this hour
[9:11] but you have also look at the other
[9:13] scriptures there's more deception this
[9:16] hour and we're we're just as prone to
[9:18] wonder as anybody else in any other
[9:21] Church age right we're prone to wonder
[9:24] right we love I love that song prone to
[9:25] wonder God I feel that prone to leave
[9:27] the God that I love I love God I love
[9:29] this message but I'm I'm prone to be
[9:31] distracted away from it so God take my
[9:34] heart and seal it for thy course above
[9:37] amen other words give me the baptism of
[9:39] the Holy Ghost and bring me back into
[9:41] Fellowship when I Stray hallelujah
[9:44] amen they wrote a song about that amen a
[9:48] song God uh seal me with thy in in thy
[9:52] courts above Lord help me to live in
[9:54] Heavenly places Hallelujah help me to
[9:56] set my affections on things above and
[9:58] not on this Earth Hall
[10:01] he said how did you ever come down to a
[10:03] humble little
[10:05] Tabernacle where peace people of low
[10:08] Walk of Life poor have nothing in this
[10:10] world most of us don't have much in this
[10:11] world think about that I'm 43 all I got
[10:14] in this world I'm still paying for 3/4
[10:16] of an acre I don't have much acre in
[10:19] this
[10:20] world I don't even have an acre right
[10:23] and I'm still point I'm still paying for
[10:24] it praise God see we don't have we don't
[10:27] have much in this world but church if we
[10:29] say faithful to God we have much in
[10:30] heaven hallelujah amen much in the
[10:33] Millennium
[10:35] hallelujah amen I love our brother
[10:37] sisters we we're so humble we're so
[10:40] we're so wretched but yet your grace
[10:42] comes to us and you give us such
[10:45] exceeding precious promises
[10:48] amen think about that if we can just
[10:50] rule over sin now he'll make us rulers
[10:52] over cities in the Millennium praise God
[10:56] you can just rule over sin now mhm these
[10:59] great precious promises remember that's
[11:01] what James I'm going to read it James
[11:03] 2:5 if I'm not
[11:05] mistaken I know we're rich in comparison
[11:08] to almost all people around the world
[11:10] but most of the time we're reminded of
[11:12] our really we're poor in United States
[11:15] uh standards right but rich in the we're
[11:18] rich in the worldly standards the
[11:19] worldwide but most of us are pretty poor
[11:22] a lot of us maybe live paycheck to
[11:23] paycheck right we're not banking up and
[11:26] banking up all this savings and our
[11:27] savings just continually abound and
[11:29] abound and abound now if you are God's
[11:32] given to you for a purpose don't trust
[11:33] in uncertain
[11:35] riches oh yeah that's right I was out
[11:37] there in Kentucky and a brother come up
[11:38] and
[11:39] uh he was a multi-millionaire he said
[11:42] but he started straining from God he was
[11:44] in Insurance he's a multi-millionaire he
[11:46] started staying from God he backslid and
[11:48] he lost he said almost
[11:50] everything he said but God's grace
[11:52] brought me back amen and now he's like
[11:55] he had all this money he they could have
[11:57] all the guest preachers come in that's
[11:58] how they built that beautiful Church uh
[12:00] uh Caris where's Caris Caris Victoria
[12:03] that's how they built that big church
[12:04] they where's
[12:06] Victoria there's a couple there's not
[12:08] it's not it's not that big of a church I
[12:10] mean there's maybe 75 people but they
[12:12] had people that were millionaires in the
[12:13] church so they could build a really nice
[12:16] church but he said he has so much money
[12:18] they can invite the most popular
[12:19] preachers and you name you Nam the most
[12:21] popular preachers in the message they've
[12:22] had them there he said I've I've hunted
[12:25] he said I taught them to a turkey
[12:27] hunt he said taken them on trips and
[12:30] Havalina hunting all the he said but
[12:32] after I fell I realized in other words I
[12:34] realized my sin and I don't even desire
[12:36] to travel no more I just want to
[12:37] strengthen the local congregation that's
[12:39] right praise God see see that money you
[12:41] know it got him all these great
[12:42] experiences but he eventually fell away
[12:44] that's right that's right and there's
[12:46] nothing wrong with having money just
[12:47] don't let it take you away from
[12:50] God but most of us most of us in in in
[12:53] terms of American stands we're we're
[12:56] we're medium middle class or low class
[12:59] but thank God we got a class hallelujah
[13:02] thank God we're not dead thank God you
[13:04] know thank God we're not in not homeless
[13:07] Hallelujah at least we got a class

[14:05] I probably could have it paid off if I
[14:07] have to do all these maintenance and
[14:08] fixing up I probably could have paid it
[14:10] off but then our house probably would
[14:12] have burned out or something like that

[14:15] old but you just we just want to be

[16:17] us amen amen the trials we go through
[16:20] now it's God's grace to us amen amen it
[16:23] would be better to be a beggar and go to

[16:28] Hallelujah
[16:29] right it's God's grace that did that
[16:34] hallelujah it's God's
[16:38] grace you know and I don't know if this
[16:40] is true or not but brother R you know
[16:42] remember he he was looking at uh uh Oral
[16:44] Roberts future home remember that or
[16:46] Roberts was building a bigger home and
[16:49] and brother BR said you know all I got a
[16:51] little trailer if you haven't seen it

[17:13] brother R's prayer was well God maybe uh
[17:15] you you couldn't uh uh trust me with the
[17:20] finances right now no doubt God probably
[17:23] could have trusted him but he looked at
[17:25] at it as in other words my God's keeping
[17:27] me humble so I can do God's perfect will
[17:30] amen amen he said Tommy o I'm sorry or
[17:33] Roberts had to have like a 100 computers
[17:35] just to print out the papers to keep
[17:37] asking and begging people for money and
[17:39] brother said I'm glad I don't have to

[19:08] God's called us to
[19:10] become
[19:12] Hallelujah brother man said you know he
[19:14] said then I thought of David how he took
[19:17] a notion to build the house of the
[19:20] Lord David said it's not right for me to
[19:22] live in the house of Cedar and the Ark
[19:24] of Covenant of my God under sheep skins
[19:27] and a tabernacle and God told the
[19:29] prophet go tell my servant David I took
[19:32] you from the Sheep coat from feeding
[19:35] them few sheep out there of your daddies
[19:37] and made you a great name like great men
[19:39] in the
[19:42] earth and so brother Ram always uses
[19:44] scripture use it in the seven seal use
[19:46] it different places in the seals he said
[19:48] this scripture always meant so much to
[19:49] him because God reminded David where he
[19:52] came from David wanted to do something
[19:55] great I want to build God a house and
[19:56] what' God say God said remember I took
[19:58] you from the Sheep
[20:00] coat right and they said then even told
[20:02] David you're a man of blood you're a man
[20:04] of war you're not going to build the
[20:06] house right but you're still a man after
[20:08] my own heart he reminds David you came
[20:12] from the Sheep Co feeding a few
[20:15] sheep and look where I brought you amen
[20:18] if we can be thankful Church where God
[20:20] brought us from this morning amen
[20:23] Where's God brought you from
[20:25] amen if you haven't listened to Austin's
[20:27] testimony lately you listen to God
[20:29] brought Austin from some sheep
[20:31] coat God brought me from the Sheep coat
[20:33] amen just a humble uh not for me a very
[20:38] sinful background very I've been telling
[20:40] Malachi some of my background this week
[20:42] you know we had more fellowship and
[20:44] we're going to have more Fellowship
[20:45] going to Iowa just telling in my
[20:47] background you know some of the more
[20:49] deeper things uh not the details of it
[20:51] but uh some of the more deeper sins that
[20:53] I was into and this this reminds me too
[20:56] it really encourages Me by God's grace
[20:58] that God can take a person whose mind is
[21:00] so degraded and God can wash it and many
[21:03] times I don't even think about those
[21:04] things because he's given me a new life
[21:07] and behold he that's in Christ is a
[21:09] brand new creature amen behold the old
[21:12] things have passed away All Things
[21:14] become new
[21:17] Hallelujah sometimes I'm surprised as I
[21:19] was talking to Mal like that's right I
[21:21] forgot I did that I forgot some of the
[21:23] depths I went to thank God Amen that he
[21:25] brought us out of the myy clay
[21:27] Hallelujah amen he put our feet on the
[21:30] Rock today
[21:31] hallelujah thank God he puts a song in
[21:33] our souls today
[21:35] amen song of Praise hallelujah praise
[21:38] God
[21:40] Amen you know he sees has this
[21:42] experience you know he's going to preach
[21:44] on Grace he sees himself you know as as
[21:46] a anti-type of zerubabel at the end of
[21:48] his ministry and then he says uh God
[21:51] reminded me that I in other words I'm
[21:53] not in control amen if God wants to take
[21:56] you somewhere if God wants to use you
[21:58] don't doubt God is going to use you
[22:00] praise God that's right amen if I just
[22:04] say if you're really born again how many
[22:06] be really born again if you're really
[22:07] born again then God is going to
[22:09] accomplish his perfect will in your
[22:12] life the only ones that don't is like
[22:15] Saul Saul is always that great example
[22:18] uh and and lot remember Saul he would
[22:21] have ruled all Israel forever if he just
[22:23] would have been faithful if he would
[22:25] have just put God's word first instead
[22:27] of pleasing the people
[22:29] people and what we've seen Church you
[22:31] know people that have come through our
[22:32] church remember I told you this one of
[22:33] the family told me they said we never
[22:34] actually put this church first we always
[22:36] put family
[22:38] first remember that we've had families
[22:41] coming and sometimes they wouldn't be
[22:42] here on a Sunday I'm like I wonder where
[22:43] they are and I text them I found out
[22:45] well they're spend their family visit so
[22:46] they don't come to church now that's the
[22:48] time you ought to come to
[22:50] church because we find out our family
[22:52] members that aren't in the message
[22:53] they're really they're led by evil
[22:55] spirits they're going to try to draw us
[22:56] away from the word yes
[22:59] church I know it it's I've seen it it's
[23:00] a
[23:01] reality they don't they're so deceived
[23:04] they don't even know what they're
[23:06] doing Hallelujah that's why church if
[23:10] you put God first you're on the right
[23:11] Road amen hallelujah you're on the right
[23:13] Road Hallelujah because God deserves to
[23:16] be
[23:17] first he deserves your your best
[23:21] Hallelujah he must be number one if you
[23:24] want to be a wise version by God's grace
[23:26] if you want to be a church after if you
[23:27] want to be a bride after the Heart of
[23:29] Jesus you got to put Jesus first amen
[23:32] hallelujah amen I'm learning lessons
[23:34] we're learning lessons that we always
[23:36] put God first and to keep sin as far
[23:39] away from you as you
[23:41] can sure remember your friends and
[23:44] family that aren't in the message
[23:46] Satan's trying to anoint them to bring
[23:47] you away from the
[23:49] truth so make your best friends message
[23:53] people amen and church don't complain I
[23:56] don't have any friends in the message
[23:57] you show yourself friendly
[23:59] you need a friend let's say hey let's go

[24:08] you no I will pay for you if you're a
[24:11] sister my wife can go with us of course
[24:15] something like that but you understand
[24:17] like if you want friends you got to show
[24:19] yourself friendly praise
[24:21] God you got to learn to reach out you
[24:23] got to you got to reach out out of your
[24:25] inhibitions out of your fears you got to
[24:27] and if someone doesn't accept it then
[24:28] maybe the next person will accept it
[24:31] right but the opposite is worse you
[24:33] don't want to let Satan keep you in this
[24:34] lonely state where you're lonely and
[24:36] defeated feel like you have no friends
[24:38] go out and make a friend amen I say if
[24:41] you can go make 10 if you can go make
[24:42] $1,000 a job surely you can go make a
[24:45] friend

[25:25] example he was always asking the
[25:26] brothers for Fellowship MH especially
[25:29] the new
[25:29] brothers he would always ask them he'd
[25:31] always invite them over or between
[25:33] Services he would try to take us out to
[25:34] eat he would always invite us you know

[25:39] all myself we'd all go over there and
[25:41] fellowship you know and just have the
[25:43] guy time you

[25:47] that and even even as when brother BRS

[25:50] Iowa uh Brother Rich remember his wife
[25:54] died uh and he was the one that was
[25:56] drinking all the diet coke he just he

[26:35] afternoon you seen it it look like polka
[26:39] dots because of bad
[26:42] food but that's what we see church we
[26:44] see that we got to draw n to God I lost
[26:46] my train of thought that's why I'm
[26:47] saying I got to find my thought again I
[26:49] don't know what but having a
[26:51] friend you know whatever you have need

[27:02] testimonies but I've always worked two
[27:04] jobs I've always been a pastor yeah I've
[27:07] always worked two jobs right and then my

[27:15] whatever more you know so we've
[27:18] sacrificed a lot and I was growing I was

[27:22] triy to donate a lot of the ties back to
[27:24] the church I still use some of course

[27:30] any God's really pouring out the
[27:31] finances am
[27:34] Hallelujah I've tried to give so much

[27:41] support this so I'm thankful for that
[27:43] I'm thankful that I I love to give it
[27:45] back but I thought you know this whole
[27:48] time you know I've had to invest in that

[28:27] Amen
[28:28] amen I didn't even know when I started
[28:30] preaching I imagine I started at uh
[28:32] let's see imagine I started at
[28:36] 10:30 now after the David comment
[28:39] brother Ram goes to this and he says I
[28:41] thought of the grace of God how that he
[28:42] could do that save to the uttermost how
[28:44] remember that from the book of Hebrews
[28:46] he can save to the
[28:50] uttermost how many people can you think
[28:52] of that my they're really deep in sin I
[28:54] don't know if God can save them but God
[28:56] can save them to the uttermost oh now I
[28:58] got a FR I'm going to share this
[29:00] testimony from Kentucky there was a 76
[29:02] year old man who walked up to me now the
[29:04] whole time I'm preaching he's smiling at
[29:05] me I'm like this guy's pretty happy I
[29:07] he's really pulling on the word of God I
[29:08] love I like this guy he even stood up a
[29:11] couple times you know he's an old man
[29:12] white man he's got all the straight hair
[29:14] he comes it straight back he's he's
[29:16] looking around you know when they're
[29:17] when they're enjoying the word of God
[29:19] his name's Glenn but he come up after me
[29:22] he said after service he said I want to
[29:24] share my testimony on Saturday night's
[29:25] service
[29:29] oh yeah saving to the uttermost saving a
[29:31] wretch he said brother Jesse I want to
[29:33] tell you four years
[29:35] ago I was living in sin he said I've
[29:39] only been coming to this church for four
[29:41] years I'm like whoa you don't find that
[29:43] very much he only been saved for 4 years
[29:46] he's 76 that means he got saved at
[29:49] 72 in the
[29:51] message so friends don't give up on
[29:54] people and let me tell you this
[29:56] testimony he said at 20 20 years old
[29:59] whatever he was in the military he said
[30:00] that's when he left believing in God and
[30:02] he said for the next 50 some years think
[30:05] about this just say 52 from 20 to 52 he
[30:09] said I gave myself over to everything
[30:11] Satan offered so can you imagine porn
[30:14] you know I don't know I'm just the
[30:17] depths of
[30:18] sin now he was married the whole time
[30:20] but he said whatever Satan told me to do
[30:22] I did it I had no question now think
[30:24] about that for 52 years God had Grace
[30:26] and didn't let him die
[30:28] M he said but when he was 72 listen he
[30:32] said the devil was telling him go get
[30:34] that gun and kill yourself go get that
[30:36] gun and kill yourself and he had to
[30:37] fight it off and he said in that in
[30:39] those moments where the and he was on
[30:41] drugs and all kinds of things a 72- man
[30:43] all all these
[30:44] drugs he said something came back when
[30:46] he used to go to church as a Baptist
[30:48] something the Baptist preacher said 50
[30:50] years ago said it reminded him of God's
[30:54] grace and then guess what one of those
[30:57] people from that the church in Kentucky
[30:59] he said basically dragged him to church
[31:02] and let me tell you this church if you
[31:05] let's be encouraged if we can do
[31:06] anything to get people to come to church
[31:08] let us do it outside of heard
[31:11] them let's not beat them up but in other
[31:15] words what I'm saying is don't take a no
[31:17] as an answer keep asking them to come to
[31:20] church amen hallelujah amen he said he
[31:24] said that he said that guy over there
[31:25] basically dragged me to church and then
[31:27] he said said that's when he repented he
[31:29] got re-baptized uh he said I got filled
[31:32] with the Holy Ghost he said now I've
[31:33] been in this message for 4 years I had
[31:35] no desire to serve God so see Church
[31:37] even at 72 God can say to the utmost
[31:42] Hallelujah everyone of us if we would
[31:44] have known him we would have written him
[31:46] off oh Impossible Too Far gone too many
[31:50] years outside of God too many years
[31:52] outside the message but our God is rich
[31:55] in Mercy
[31:59] he stay to the utmost I started crying I
[32:02] said brother I'm more blessed to be here
[32:04] than for you guys to have me here that's
[32:07] right and they poured out like I told
[32:09] you they poured out so many Financial
[32:11] blessings on me I'm like what what's
[32:12] going on here you guys have like an ATM
[32:14] that prints off money or something like
[32:16] that does money grow on trees in
[32:18] Kentucky I'm going start ready we might
[32:19] have to move down to Kentucky
[32:20] everybody I'll buy some acres and we'll
[32:22] all move down there cuz I think money
[32:24] grows on
[32:25] trees no it doesn't they work their
[32:28] tails off is what they
[32:31] do but see to save to the utmost so in
[32:34] other words let it be a fresh reminder
[32:36] don't ever give up on
[32:38] God because God can save to the
[32:42] uttermost that's what I was even tell my
[32:44] dad and different other ones I said God
[32:45] didn't even call Abraham till he was
[32:48] 755 he was an idol worshiper brother he
[32:51] you know brother man dramatized it like
[32:52] his dad showed him how to make idols and
[32:54] I dramatized it a few year maybe last
[32:56] year he would Bow Down think of Abraham
[32:58] for 75 years bowing down praying
[33:00] sacrificing to these wooden images and
[33:02] he's like I know these things don't talk
[33:03] I know they don't hear my but he had to
[33:05] do it because he had to follow his daddy
[33:07] and then one day the voice of the Lord
[33:09] said get thee up out of thy country get
[33:11] thee away from thy
[33:13] Kindred now he partially obeyed just
[33:15] like us
[33:18] amen that's a little better and he
[33:21] partially obeyed just like us yeah
[33:24] that's right brother and then and then
[33:26] he said Abraham par obeyed but then he
[33:28] did exactly what God told him not to do
[33:31] he took lot with him and look God's
[33:34] grace still ended to Abraham and church
[33:36] can extend to us cuz we're Abraham seed
[33:39] hallelujah amen All Nations will be
[33:42] blessed through
[33:44] Abraham if you have faith in Jesus
[33:46] Christ you're a child of Abraham I don't
[33:49] always obey perfectly but God will make
[33:52] sure I obey him
[33:53] amen that's what a faithful dad will do
[33:56] he'll make sure you obey the word of God
[33:59] Amen that's right amen is that right

[34:08] God that's right
[34:12] Hallelujah don't ever give up on God God
[34:16] sure don't give up on
[34:17] you brother tells it later you know he
[34:20] tells it later in this
[34:21] sermon he said you know we try to be
[34:23] children of Faith he said he said we try
[34:25] to believe in Divine Healing and then uh
[34:27] the next day we get a tum tummy ache and
[34:29] he says we we lose all of our faith for
[34:31] Divine
[34:32] Healing he's talking about Abraham amen
[34:35] right we want to be children of Faith he
[34:37] said but we do things that we shouldn't
[34:39] do sometimes right but did God throw
[34:43] away Abraham no sir God finished the
[34:46] work that he had planned for Abraham God
[34:49] will finish the work he's planned for
[34:51] you and
[34:53] I amen it's impossible for God to fail
[34:58] whatever you were whatever you were in
[34:59] the mind of God how many know they in
[35:00] the mind of God before the foundation
[35:01] world as a real believer whatever you

[35:05] to pass because he's going to teach you
[35:06] to surrender Hallelujah he's going to

[35:12] many see that before God drives you
[35:15] away God will drive you to obey as
[35:18] well God will drive you he'll move you
[35:21] into difficult situations just to see
[35:22] what you're going to do yeah brother
[35:25] said it's the greatest thing that ever
[35:26] happened to you is the trial
[35:29] oh it's hard to say Amen to that that's
[35:30] true
[35:33] amen he said he can say to the uttermost
[35:36] even a 72y old man who has no signs of
[35:39] being
[35:43] saved he'll save him from suicide praise
[35:45] God Amen Hallelujah he can save to the
[35:49] uttermost
[35:52] Hallelujah he says and then God would
[35:54] take a poor Wretch like myself and give
[35:57] me the opport opportunity to preach the
[35:58] gospel and to see others
[36:00] saved see them healed see homes that's
[36:03] been broke up straightened up

[36:09] highlights of his ministry see how God
[36:11] saving me God healing up homes and
[36:14] families God's saving people hallelujah
[36:17] these are the highlights of Christianity
[36:19] amen a house that loves God children
[36:23] that love God Amen parents that love God
[36:26] that's a highlight that's a miracle
[36:32] Hallelujah see lives that's been ruined
[36:35] made right
[36:37] again and give me Grace I thought oh
[36:39] it's amazing race then come to a degra

[36:44] degraded not upgraded we all like to
[36:46] upgrade our phones

[36:50] laptop I'm going to upgrade to a better
[36:53] car I'm going to upgrade to what better
[36:56] clothes but he says the opposite of
[36:59] himself how you ever came to a low
[37:02] degraded he said low squirrel Hunter out
[37:05] in the woods and form himself in the
[37:08] form of a rainbow which means a
[37:11] covenant look what look what he's called
[37:13] himself so far and look how people
[37:15] describe oh we're the bride I'm the word
[37:17] I'm God made flesh I'm all this look how
[37:19] look and this is right after brother
[37:22] meets God amen amen right after he sees
[37:24] Jesus in a rainbow here's the voice of
[37:26] God he does he doesn't say I'm the bride
[37:27] look at me I'm the seven Church age
[37:29] messenger I'm the mighty prophet of God
[37:31] he said I'm a low degraded squirrel
[37:34] Hunter I'm a humble person of nothing he
[37:37] said it's God's Amazing Grace on me
[37:40] Hallelujah in other words the
[37:42] experiences don't make him Pride
[37:44] prideful the experiences make him humble
[37:47] praise
[37:48] God Amen that's right that's what real
[37:51] Christianity is it's experiences that
[37:53] make you more humble so you can follow
[37:55] God
[37:56] closer that's right
[37:59] so let's let's look
[38:02] again he's called degrad he calls
[38:05] himself
[38:06] degraded now in your soul let me say
[38:08] this in your soul you're upgraded
[38:09] brother

[38:13] upgrade cu the Bible said your soul was
[38:15] dead in sins and trespasses
[38:18] Hallelujah but that you've been
[38:20] quickened or Made Alive by the holy
[38:22] spirit so your soul has received a 100%
[38:26] upgrade fully uploaded

[38:43] I'm upgraded to the day of my Redemption
[38:49] Hallelujah but here's where we get the
[38:52] gred our mind and our flesh instead of
[38:54] getting uploaded sometimes we get
[38:56] degraded sometimes right we think
[38:58] degraded thoughts the church
[39:01] said we actually perform degraded
[39:04] actions yes brother man said you came to
[39:07] a degraded low squirrel Hunter remember
[39:10] what he call himself
[39:12] earlier poor illiterate wret like
[39:17] me Hallelujah this is how this is
[39:20] another reason how I know brother man's
[39:21] a true prophet of God that's right I
[39:23] don't hear any of these other people
[39:25] humbling themselves like this yeah yeah
[39:29] contrary to what they say brother's life
[39:30] was free from Scandal that's right free
[39:33] from Scandal he was true to his
[39:35] wife you know both were alive he was
[39:38] true to that one
[39:40] wife he didn't know how the taxes work
[39:43] so he had to do the IRS
[39:45] case Hallelujah but he lived the Gospel
[39:48] of Jesus Christ he preached the Gospel
[39:50] of Jesus Christ and he made it so real
[39:52] to me that I living and following it all
[39:54] my life amen l i i i gladly accept any
[39:58] rejection I'll gladly accept any
[40:00] criticism because I know brother and
[40:01] preach thus sayith the Bible amen I know
[40:04] it praise God nobody can talk me out of
[40:07] it praise God Amen because the holy
[40:09] spirit is The Giver of Revelation he's
[40:11] the spirit of Truth
[40:13] amen and we are lovers of the truth we
[40:16] are living the truth and we live by the
[40:18] truth praise God they can't talk me out
[40:20] of it because God's already show me the
[40:22] revelation of it amen amen
[40:24] amen praise God so we should be able to
[40:27] say Lord have pity on me I'm a poor no
[40:29] I'm sorry I'm a rich naturally I'm a
[40:32] rich literate
[40:34] wret I'm a degraded low school
[40:38] teacher factory
[40:40] worker whatever you are
[40:44] student thank he says thank you for
[40:46] Amazing Grace he said he gave me a
[40:48] message of Grace that he give me to
[40:50] preach and he formed it there in the
[40:52] Covenant that he's behind it so brother
[40:55] took that I saw that experience to show
[40:57] me God show me he's behind the one God
[41:00] teaching amen he's behind it Hallelujah
[41:03] then brother said now he show me he's
[41:05] behind my preaching on
[41:07] Grace I love it and this is one of the
[41:10] highlights of the sermon if you hear the
[41:11] people shout and brother man's
[41:14] voice he said and he's behind it and
[41:17] brother said he'll be behind
[41:20] it because the message is of Jesus
[41:24] Christ and His Glory Hallelujah
[41:27] I love it 1961 brother said Jesus is
[41:30] this message he'll be behind this
[41:31] message and let me say it now in 2024
[41:34] Jesus is behind this message and he'll
[41:37] be behind this
[41:39] message you next Generation you stay
[41:42] with this message because Jesus Christ
[41:44] is behind
[41:46] you he's pushing one God he's pushing
[41:49] Lord Jesus Christ pushing Grace's three
[41:53] pushing Len he's behind that he's
[41:56] telling his creatures the preaching
[41:58] that's amazing
[42:00] gra
[42:02] Hallelujah he's not behind the
[42:05] compromising preachers the mega churches
[42:07] he's not behind that he's behind one
[42:10] thing that's his word
[42:13] hallelujah he'll be behind
[42:16] it because it's thus say the Bible am
[42:20] thus sayi the Lord hallelujah
[42:22] amen that's exactly right
[42:27] makes him so
[42:29] humble he said we've got theologians
[42:31] today we've got doctors of divinity we
[42:33] got great men all over the world that's
[42:35] smart intelligent educated but it takes
[42:37] the Simplicity of believing God to make
[42:40] his word speak out to show that Jesus
[42:42] Christ is the same yesterday forever
[42:45] listen he said it takes a humble heart
[42:47] dedicated to
[42:49] God it brings Jesus Christ into the
[42:53] present tense he
[42:55] say see church this is what we want we
[42:58] want Jesus Christ to be in a present
[43:00] tense other words his spirit's right now
[43:02] teaching us and giving us what we have
[43:04] need of for our
[43:05] journey he's not something from the past
[43:08] or Jesus used to work here but now he
[43:09] don't work he should be present tense
[43:11] right here Among
[43:13] Us right know we know he's going to do
[43:16] in the future we know he's going to be
[43:17] there in the future but we got to
[43:19] recognize recognize he's present tense
[43:21] but brother said takes a humble heart
[43:23] that's dedicated to God now think about
[43:26] the times where God was most you're most
[43:28] convinced God was in your life you can
[43:31] get back to
[43:32] that it just takes a humble heart he
[43:35] says and dedication to God this is what
[43:38] I found church this what I
[43:40] found Satan he he just used his time to
[43:44] slowly introduce sins or slowly
[43:47] introduce uh uh Temptations in our life
[43:51] that slowly take away our devotion and
[43:53] dedication to
[43:55] God it's just something slow something
[43:58] small and then after time goes by and
[44:01] let's say this sin or this temptation
[44:02] goes greater and greater and and you
[44:04] know he tries to make us think sin isn't
[44:06] as bad as it is right but then one one
[44:10] day we just wake up and we realize my I
[44:13] I'm so far from where I used to
[44:16] be right and we just wake up that's the
[44:18] moment where we got to repent and say
[44:20] God I want you back in my life in a
[44:22] present tense amen I'm tired of of of
[44:27] thinking about oh it used to be like
[44:28] this God give me that feeling back
[44:30] praise
[44:32] God now many times you know got not all
[44:34] the time but many times God will use
[44:36] that in my life when I go preach to
[44:37] other places because I I see that I you
[44:39] know people always respond better you
[44:41] know when they haven't heard you very
[44:42] often you know just the natural but
[44:45] those are always times I I I saw Mal I
[44:48] think you know when we were out in uh
[44:49] Napoleon last year and
[44:51] then even down there in Kentucky I was
[44:53] telling the girls yeah we go into those
[44:55] atmospheres and like I don't know have
[44:57] any trouble with sin there's something
[44:59] really special about that
[45:01] Hallelujah but we just don't have to
[45:03] wait for those times we can have it
[45:04] anytime we want praise God but God God
[45:08] lets us go through Seasons so we can see
[45:10] right we can see that where we're
[45:12] letting up in our walk and then God can
[45:14] strengthen us to live stronger every
[45:17] single day
[45:18] amen hallelujah amen in other words keep
[45:21] ourselves keep our minds on fire this is
[45:23] what needs on fire right here amen you
[45:26] got the Holy Ghost thank God for that
[45:27] but you got to use that to let it get
[45:29] you on fire right here praise
[45:31] God so you can have a humble heart a
[45:34] humble mind and keep your mind dedicated
[45:37] to God
[45:38] Amen right and don't let your mind be uh
[45:41] used by the devil to bring certain
[45:43] imaginations into your mind just stay
[45:46] with your mind on God pure things amen
[45:49] amen unto the pure all things are pure
[45:54] amen hallelujah but said Jesus never
[45:57] came to
[45:59] theologians he came to Humble
[46:01] fishermen right so the the the smart the
[46:04] wise educated they wouldn't accept God's
[46:06] grace the way it came yeah right because
[46:08] they didn't want to change from their
[46:09] ways Grace is trying to show you this is
[46:12] the way out of all your legalism right
[46:14] the Pharisees Grace God's Jesus was
[46:16] trying to show them God's grace will
[46:17] bring you out of this false religion
[46:19] you're teaching Commandments of men
[46:22] right and it's vain worship yeah God's
[46:24] not receiving your worship cuz you have
[46:27] self-righteousness instead of God's
[46:29] righteousness Hallelujah I don't think
[46:31] we to spend too much time on legalism
[46:33] you know I've gone over that quite
[46:38] extensively you know but just remember
[46:39] you know legalism in the message is oh
[46:41] you have to have this certain type of
[46:43] clothes or this certain type of uh uh
[46:46] you have to recognize these certain type
[46:49] of holidays you know or not recognize
[46:50] certain types of holidays it's man-made
[46:53] righteousness I'm surprised church so
[46:55] many people forget take everything back
[46:57] to the word of God like a topic will
[46:59] come up and people instantly say brother
[47:01] said this and they just forget well what
[47:02] did the Bible say about that what the
[47:05] Bible say about does the have anything
[47:07] to say about this of course yes of
[47:11] course like like somebody online today
[47:13] just you know I was just going through
[47:14] the comments briefly they said oh you
[47:15] believe the tribulation seven years
[47:17] you're a heretic like that like what how
[47:21] does that even affect the G it has
[47:22] nothing to do with the
[47:24] Gentiles if you got the Holy Ghost you
[47:26] ain't going to be here exactly now maybe
[47:29] he's upset because you don't have the
[47:30] Holy Ghost and he's going to be
[47:32] here I said sir your Zeal has eaten up
[47:34] your
[47:35] wisdom you know just this this this
[47:38] man-made uh traditions of men yeah right
[47:42] creating your own righteousness Grace
[47:45] doesn't do that Grace doesn't create
[47:47] legalism
[47:49] amen Grace accepts God's word and Grace
[47:52] accepts just what God gives us to do
[47:54] praise God Amen it doesn't create it own
[47:58] self-righteousness now you might have to
[48:00] create boundaries in your life that keep
[48:02] you from sinning that's right and that
[48:05] might be a safeguard to
[48:07] you but you can't use it as
[48:10] legalism right so let me give some
[48:13] examples so like you and I we won't go
[48:15] to movie theaters right most of the
[48:18] time right now if they just have a
[48:20] Christian show uh we did a couple years
[48:22] ago we went to Pilgrim's Progress it was
[48:23] a beautiful movie but we I had to be I
[48:26] had to watch my children they were
[48:27] younger had to watch them don't look at
[48:28] those movie posters right you know let's
[48:30] walk the other way cuz there's some Evil
[48:32] movie posters over
[48:34] there there C there's certain safeguards
[48:38] now could someone walk into a movie
[48:39] theater and win a soul yes but we're not
[48:42] Jesus Jesus could sit with Sinners and
[48:44] publicans and prostitutes and the spirit
[48:46] of God he was always obedient and he
[48:48] knew that he'd bring them to repentance
[48:50] exactly but we set up for me I'll never
[48:53] I'll never drink alcohol in public I set
[48:55] that up as a a safeguard that I don't
[48:57] cause people to stumble that's right I
[48:59] don't want it I told my I said I'm I I
[49:02] have Godly fear I don't want people to
[49:04] take a picture hey there's a pastor at
[49:06] Applebees he's got and I want I don't
[49:08] want I don't want them to put that all
[49:09] over
[49:10] Facebook because that could cause people
[49:12] to
[49:13] stumble I'm fear I'm fearful of that
[49:17] that's good Godly fear amen because the
[49:19] fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[49:21] wisdom hallelujah amen you're not even
[49:24] wise yet until you fear God's so much
[49:27] that you hate
[49:29] sin when you hate sin now you just
[49:31] started wisdom amen amen now how many
[49:34] know God can restore your
[49:35] wisdom because like I said that's what
[49:37] the process is we have God gives us all
[49:39] the Zeal to hate sin but then through
[49:41] time the devil attacks our mind but
[49:43] God's got to bring us back to our first
[49:45] love and restore our wisdom amen amen
[49:49] everybody understand what I'm
[49:51] saying like Peter Peter had wisdom he
[49:53] had the Holy Ghost but remember legalism
[49:55] came in I'm not going to eat with the
[49:56] Gentiles see Satan slowly worked on him
[50:00] well these preachers you know they're
[50:01] going to say this if I do this and I I
[50:03] don't want to offend them but you're
[50:05] going to offend the Gentiles
[50:07] right see but slowly and it took
[50:09] somebody to walk up and put a finger
[50:11] right up under uh nature put your finger
[50:13] right up on my no under my
[50:15] nose and say you're the guilty one
[50:18] guilty one yeah that's what it that's
[50:20] what it take a preacher now you wouldn't
[50:22] do it in the service you probably did it
[50:23] outside the service cuz we want
[50:25] everything Godly in order right reverent
[50:28] order and she he said Peter you're the
[50:32] guilty
[50:33] one that's what he need he need reminded
[50:36] to go back to his first love that's
[50:38] right oh God grace saved us both that's
[50:41] right the wall has been torn down the
[50:43] wall between the Jew and Gentile has
[50:45] been torn down but we have to set up
[50:47] safeguards in our lives
[50:50] amen and for some of you it might be a a
[50:52] a partner for
[50:54] accountability you might need an
[50:55] accountability partner mhm to overcome
[50:58] something for a
[50:59] while right where you can check in with
[51:01] someone that say check up on me make
[51:03] sure I'm doing okay by God's grace set
[51:06] up safeguards what if you have private
[51:08] property and someone's in your yard all
[51:10] the time what would you do You' put up a
[51:11] fence yes you put up a safeguard so we
[51:15] must do that spiritually put up
[51:17] safeguards in our lives to protect us
[51:20] hallelujah
[51:24] amen now brother said I'm trying to
[51:26] close where we at oh okay wow
[51:28] 11:30 I know you've been all happy
[51:30] nobody's fallen asleep so I might preach
[51:31] a little bit
[51:33] longer brother said Grace is old Grace
[51:36] is I'll say like this grace is
[51:38] eternal Grace is as old as the world
[51:42] is Grace was first shown to the human
[51:44] race when he had the beginning of the
[51:46] human race when the human race was first
[51:48] created in the Garden of Eden on that
[51:50] dark morning when that little woman had
[51:51] stepped across the separating line
[51:52] brother man said he's just dramatizing
[51:54] he said but when Eve did what she did
[51:56] with the
[51:57] he said all the clouds gathered all over
[52:00] instead of light now all the clouds came
[52:02] and it became dark for the first
[52:09] time he said and she gone away from
[52:11] God's commandment and enticed her
[52:13] husband to do the same and then the law
[52:15] was broken sin he said the law must have
[52:17] a penalty or isn't a
[52:19] law the day you eat thereof the day you
[52:22] shall surely die it was a process of
[52:25] dying right it wasn't immediate it was a
[52:30] process said oh how it was
[52:33] terrible he said but when Jehovah come
[52:36] out I could imagine there wasn't even a
[52:38] star to shine it was so dark in that
[52:40] light little garden that once was
[52:42] because sinid blotted out had taken the
[52:44] light from among them so brother
[52:47] dramatized the clouds came over it was
[52:48] totally dark what did ad do they went
[52:51] and hid in the bushes they got some fig
[52:53] leaves together and covered up just
[52:55] their private parts only they they
[52:56] covered up their private parts
[52:58] only and God comes walking down in the
[53:00] midst of I love it God working in
[53:02] darkness
[53:03] amen just like at the beginning
[53:05] Hallelujah the pillar of fire amen it
[53:08] rotated around the earth it shined upon
[53:11] the Earth though Earth was without form
[53:13] and void and it was dark but God sent
[53:15] light to the darkness amen church God
[53:18] always sends light to the darkness your
[53:20] Darkness
[53:21] amen amen God will come walk in the
[53:24] midst of your Darkness amen and say say
[53:26] where are
[53:27] you I missed that time talking with you

[56:43] Pious life a reverent life that's right
[56:45] that's why the Bible says in James 1
[56:47] pure religion is to visit uh the widows

[1:02:20] 3:21 Church there has to be
[1:02:23] consequences our mistakes that doesn't
[1:02:26] mean we're less children of God it just
[1:02:29] means God is trying to teach us
[1:02:32] something Adam knew better Eve knew
[1:02:34] better to some degree now she was
[1:02:35] deceived in that act but she knew better
[1:02:37] not to eat of the tree she did know
[1:02:39] better God told her and
[1:02:42] Adam Genesis
[1:02:52] 3:21 okay now remember verse 20 said
[1:02:54] this shows how Eve was already pregnant
[1:02:56] in verse 20 and Adam called his wife's
[1:02:58] names Eve because she was the mother of
[1:03:00] all living she's already pregnant most
[1:03:02] people recognize Genesis 4:1 is where
[1:03:04] Eve has her first uh pregnancy but it's
[1:03:06] actually earlier because that proves it
[1:03:08] she's already a mother of all
[1:03:10] living verse 21 and unto Adam also and
[1:03:13] to his wife did the Lord God make coats
[1:03:15] of
[1:03:18] skins and clothe them cover them so he
[1:03:21] gave them real
[1:03:22] religion a sacrifice covered their sins

[1:03:58] there got their man-made religions right
[1:04:00] their man-made traditions and God's love
[1:04:03] breaks through that's right it says but

[1:11:43] and some leaves amen he's going to pass
[1:11:45] those around for the Nations to be
[1:11:47] healed quite a quite a
[1:11:51] story verse 23 therefore the Lord God s
[1:11:55] sent him forth from the Garden of Eden
[1:11:57] to till the ground from when he was
[1:11:59] taken so look at this here's what I want
[1:12:01] to get to so he drove out the man and
[1:12:02] placed at the east of the Garden of Eden
[1:12:05] cherubims and a flaming sword which
[1:12:07] turned every way to keep the way of the
[1:12:09] tree of
[1:12:11] life and church this was God's
[1:12:14] grace God's grace forgave their sin and
[1:12:17] then God's grace drove them out you
[1:12:20] forsook this I'm driving you out to do a
[1:12:22] job didn't say God had a D Moses to
[1:12:26] become a
[1:12:27] prophet he had to drive him out of the
[1:12:29] Wilderness so he could repent of all his
[1:12:30] worldly School
[1:12:32] knowledge God has to drive you to do
[1:12:35] things and that's God's grace to you
[1:12:38] amen amen God had to drive him out the
[1:12:41] Holy Ghost When It Came Upon Jesus the
[1:12:43] Bible said Jesus was led up in the
[1:12:45] spirit of wilderness to be tempted the
[1:12:47] devil yeah Mark 1:12 and immediately the
[1:12:50] spirit drives him into the
[1:12:53] Wilderness see what the spirit of God
[1:12:55] it'll drive you into a test it'll drive
