[38:19] [Music]
[38:42] I like to preach a little bit about the
[38:46] rapture I kind of want to do it under
[38:49] this subject we looking at rightly
[38:52] dividing the word of truth yesterday by
[38:56] the Amen and who and I had a Bible study
[38:58] and some of these thoughts were really
[38:59] striking me as important you know so I
[39:02] like to preach some of them and then
[39:04] yesterday brother Simon and I had like
[39:05] little ministers meeting cam couldn't
[39:07] make it so we had a little ministers
[39:08] meeting and we were looking at the
[39:12] rapture you know and so I just want to
[39:14] share I just want to look at a few
[39:16] things Lord willing this morning
[39:18] so let's go to second Timothy chapter 2
[39:20] you want to rightly divide the word of
[39:22] truth about the rapture 2nd Timothy 2:11
[39:40] and bring greetings our son greetings
[39:44] from brother sorry Percy
[39:50] Denis McBride and forgive me and we're
[39:54] gonna try to get him to come up and
[39:55] minister he lives in South Carolina is a
[39:57] tremendous brother just so you know he
[39:59] he stopped pastoring back in October the
[40:02] Lord put it on his heart and everybody
[40:04] transitioned back into brother
[40:05] Anderson's Church and they're doing
[40:07] really well I said since you have all
[40:10] that free time maybe come up and preach
[40:11] for us sometime so looking forward to
[40:14] having him come maybe in November he
[40:15] just started a new job god blessed him
[40:17] with a really nice job and so I said
[40:20] well when's the earliest we could get
[40:21] you up here and so perhaps November so
[40:24] we'll look at that and hopefully we can
[40:25] make that happen he's just a tremendous
[40:28] brother what a good example of Christ
[40:32] second Timothy two sorry verse 11 let's
[40:36] just look at our scripture here the
[40:41] Bible says it is a faithful saying for
[40:45] if we be dead with him we should also
[40:47] live with him
[40:48] if we suffer we shall also reign with
[40:52] him if we deny him he will deny us if we
[40:56] believe not yet he abideth faithful he
[40:59] cannot deny himself of these things put
[41:03] them in remembrance charging them before
[41:04] the Lord that they strive not about
[41:06] words to no profit but to the subverting
[41:09] of the hearers study the show thyself
[41:12] approved unto God a workman that needeth
[41:15] not to be ashamed rightly dividing the
[41:18] word of truth but shun profane and vain
[41:21] babblings for they will increase unto
[41:23] more ungodliness and that's what we're
[41:25] seeing today with a lot of the preaching
[41:27] on the rapture just a lot of fun you
[41:30] know babbling
[41:31] you make it up nonsense so we just want
[41:34] to be solid
[41:36] let's may God has blessings the ring of
[41:38] his word you may be seated there praise
[41:39] the Lord I'd like to just greet
[41:50] everybody name of the Lord and say we
[41:52] missed you last week but I just want to
[41:53] give a little recap we had a tremendous
[41:54] day of services last Sunday Brother cams
[41:58] sister Wendy was there we had a
[42:00] wonderful time in the Lord brother cam
[42:03] after the first service I think I
[42:05] preached about two hours the morning
[42:07] services I'm not mistaken I just said
[42:09] I'm not even paying attention that clock
[42:10] I'm just gonna preach I preached on God
[42:14] rewards the diligence I looked at all
[42:16] the thoughts I've been preaching to you
[42:17] about investing in your gifts being
[42:21] faithful and brother cam came up
[42:24] afterwards and he was just crying and he
[42:27] said God has given us a yeren Thummim he
[42:30] said so what that means is he said God
[42:33] discerned everything going on in their
[42:35] church
[42:35] so I thank the Lord for that and I want
[42:40] when some one person told me they're
[42:41] about ready to quit that morning they
[42:44] were they were they decided they're
[42:45] gonna quit with a certain decision their
[42:48] life and then the word came and rebuked
[42:50] him and then they got right back to
[42:52] where they need to be because the
[42:54] message was all about not quitting
[42:56] continuing to invest in your gifts and
[42:59] then God will give you you know
[43:00] blessings and rewards and there's a few
[43:05] more things where did I put my paper oh
[43:10] yeah and the brother cam said that the
[43:13] preaching cleared up predestination he
[43:15] said he's been confused on
[43:16] predestination but I showed how God
[43:18] cannot predestinate without
[43:20] foreknowledge so it starts with
[43:21] foreknowledge is what God starts with I
[43:23] read all the quotes her brother Branham
[43:25] says God can't force you to do anything
[43:27] and God can't force you to to sin and
[43:32] then condemn you to hell
[43:33] he gives free more agency so brother cam
[43:36] said that totally cleared it up for him
[43:38] I thank the Lord for that we had two
[43:41] healings I say kind of
[43:45] the sister with cancer hurt her she
[43:47] brought her son up for prayer he he
[43:48] struggles with what is it not asthma but
[43:52] allergies and so while we're praying for
[43:55] him she said she felt the Holy Spirit
[43:59] and I think her testimony was if maybe
[44:01] Wendy if I'm wrong you can correct me
[44:02] but since she had the cancer she lost
[44:04] like the outer part of her eyesight like
[44:07] she could still see fine but there was
[44:09] she was getting shadows around the
[44:10] outside you know of her eyesight and she
[44:13] said after we prayed for her or what we
[44:15] weren't him praying for her we praying
[44:16] for her son and after we prayed she said
[44:19] she opened her eyes and her eyes were
[44:20] completely healed so we thank the Lord
[44:23] for that and that's that's just like the
[44:25] Lord no that's just like the Lord you
[44:29] know like when you're interceding for
[44:31] somebody else you get a blessing and
[44:34] then brother Mike he's the one in the
[44:36] wheelchair and he said he just came up
[44:39] for prayer at the second service I think
[44:41] it was yeah I think of a second or first
[44:44] service I can't remember he said just
[44:46] pray for me I've got so much pain he
[44:48] went home he said that night he got the
[44:50] best sleep he's had in years so I just
[44:52] want to thank the Lord for that and I'd
[44:54] felt led you know I felt led to raise
[44:56] him up out of the wheelchair but I was
[44:59] looking for a few more signs you know
[45:01] that have been a tremendous thing but
[45:02] but I I didn't see the signs I asked God
[45:05] for so I asked him I said cam has that
[45:08] ever been done he said yes he said three
[45:09] brothers have come through under the
[45:11] anointing of the Holy Spirit raised him
[45:13] up but the strength never came in his
[45:15] legs yet but he's still believing God's
[45:17] gonna give it to him and like brother
[45:20] Graham said it takes more faith to
[45:21] believe God when he doesn't answer your
[45:24] prayer
[45:25] remember the German baby the stad cliff
[45:27] family they were gonna fly brother
[45:29] branham over to raise their dead child
[45:32] from the dead and they said pray by
[45:35] brother Ram he prayed a couple of days
[45:37] he waited the Holy Spirit said no it's
[45:39] the hand of the Lord and then the stand
[45:42] cliff family said what did we do brother
[45:43] branham do something wrong and program
[45:45] said no he said you've got more faith
[45:47] because you're able to love and serve
[45:49] God even though God chose not to raise
[45:51] your baby from the dead and so that's
[45:55] where the lutheran congregation or the
[45:58] lutheran seminary looked a brother
[45:59] branham and said we've got more respect
[46:01] for you now because you waited to you
[46:03] heard thus saith the lord before
[46:05] speaking something up or acting on
[46:07] something and so that's what we wanted
[46:10] that's where church I honestly believe
[46:12] this with all my heart that's where I
[46:14] believe our church and other message
[46:17] churches are heading our ministry has to
[46:19] match the Ministry of Jesus Christ
[46:21] before the rapture and brother Branham
[46:23] said well Jesus said I don't do anything
[46:27] except the father shows me first so that
[46:32] means we have to wait till we get the
[46:34] leadership of the Holy Spirit before we
[46:35] speak the word before we do something if
[46:38] we're not sure we just pray a blessing
[46:39] upon someone and ask God for his mercy
[46:42] like Jacob just said let your mercy be
[46:45] upon me you know he just prayed for the
[46:47] mercy of God and that's what I believe
[46:49] is happening with the bride I believe
[46:52] God is teaching us to just wait to speak
[46:54] it until we got the say at the Lord and
[46:58] let me just give you an example I think
[47:00] some of you might know who I'm talking
[47:01] about but I want you to know I'm not
[47:03] trying to I'm not trying to say anything
[47:07] negative about this person but but this
[47:09] person was a real dear person and they
[47:12] told me one time you know and I was
[47:14] there they told me we were at a little
[47:16] can we rented a little meeting and we
[47:17] were bothered by the mosquitoes and this
[47:20] person said they spoke the words of the
[47:22] mosquitos and they didn't get any bites
[47:24] by the mosquitoes yet the whole time I'm
[47:26] getting bitten up by the mosquitoes I'm
[47:31] trying to help you understand that I
[47:33] didn't feel led to speak to any
[47:35] mosquitoes was i tormented
[47:39] solutely well I didn't feel led but now
[47:42] just to kind of show you you and I don't
[47:45] have control over when we speak the word
[47:49] now the same person that spoke to
[47:51] mosquitos and that skills didn't touch
[47:54] them the same person has now gone
[47:55] through tremendous trials in their lives
[47:58] where family members are turning away
[48:00] from the message I just want to just
[48:02] bring out an observation this person has
[48:05] not spoken the word to bring the family
[48:07] person the family members back if it was
[48:13] just so easy we would just help and just
[48:15] speak the word and bring him back no you
[48:18] have to wait upon the Lord to lead you
[48:21] to speak something so you know we've had
[48:25] a lot of Angelus come in which I've been
[48:26] so grateful for and there a lot of them
[48:28] are preaching on speaking the word and
[48:30] that's true but we can't do it without
[48:32] God's leading it has to be God's leading
[48:38] like I said I've just seen it three or
[48:40] four times in my life the last one was
[48:42] when he prayed for my friend's father
[48:45] prayed for him and I just felt led to
[48:47] speak to it and he came out he's fully
[48:49] recovered now he almost died he was in a
[48:51] coma for weeks but as we spoke it I'm
[48:55] crying in my closet I spoke it and said
[48:57] he's gonna come out in Jesus Christ's
[48:59] name and he came out the doctor said you
[49:02] got one chance to come out and now
[49:04] church you know as I did as I felt a lot
[49:06] of emotion I just I felt led to pray and
[49:08] you know same thing with Simon so the
[49:11] point I'm saying is that brother Brandon
[49:12] tells us in the church age book God is
[49:16] also trying to teach us patience and if
[49:19] God just answered all of our requests
[49:21] just by speaking the word we'll just
[49:23] speak to work with just if he did that
[49:24] we'd be more impatient so just try to
[49:30] understand that and try to understand
[49:32] what I'm saying God is strengthening the
[49:35] bride he's he's teaching us to wait upon
[49:37] him because he doesn't want us to do
[49:39] anything except he tells us first the
[49:43] bride knows what he wants done with the
[49:45] word but she waits until he it's his
[49:47] time to do it like Paul remember he
[49:51] couldn't cast a demon out of that girl
[49:53] until many days later till he felt the
[49:54] leadership of the Lord to do that and
[49:58] church you and I can't do that either
[49:59] it's not as simple as just just speak
[50:01] the word it's not simple as if someone's
[50:03] got a problem we'll just speak the word
[50:04] Amen just speak the word it's not that
[50:06] simple it's really pray about it and
[50:09] find the mind of God that's the real
[50:12] will of God now it's different now it's
[50:15] different if you know you feel led to
[50:16] tell them to speak the word that's
[50:18] different you understand what I'm saying
[50:20] yeah and there's there's quotes brother
[50:25] Branham said like he says sometimes
[50:28] people are so under trials that he said
[50:32] you try to say get next to yourself but
[50:34] they can't because it's not the time and
[50:37] season for it whether you're mad in a
[50:40] complex or you've been so scarred from
[50:43] your past
[50:44] there's things God lets us experience
[50:47] years and years of suffering until a
[50:50] certain moment then he brings victory
[50:52] and deliverance like Joseph Joseph verse
[50:56] was at seventh note thirteen years he
[50:58] held that pain of being betrayed by his
[51:01] brothers until he saw them face to face
[51:04] and that was the moment to release it he
[51:07] didn't he didn't release an anger he
[51:10] released it Grace and the Bible said he
[51:13] wept so much that that all those in the
[51:16] palace could hear him crying he had to
[51:19] hold in there for the time and season
[51:20] for healing to come as ever you
[51:22] understand he just couldn't speak the
[51:24] word against to say I'm not gonna have
[51:25] any hurt I'm not gonna know you had to
[51:27] wait for the time and moment this the
[51:29] the healing or the season or healing so
[51:35] just I want to just encourage you with
[51:36] that that with this brother in the
[51:40] wheelchair I told brother amen and hooah
[51:41] that I every bleed out felt my heart
[51:43] when we see him rise I really believe
[51:45] and this is just could be me but I
[51:46] really believe that will be a time where
[51:50] the rapture is close I'm sure because
[51:52] brother Graham said the fullness of
[51:53] Pentecost will be in the bride and right
[51:56] after Pentecost Acts chapter 3 that he
[51:59] Peter grabbed that man's hand and said
[52:02] silver and gold I don't have but what I
[52:04] have I give to you and when he wrote it
[52:06] when he pulled him up
[52:07] time strength instantly came into his
[52:09] legs and they've tried it three times of
[52:12] the church and it wasn't the time and
[52:13] season but see at least they got the
[52:15] faith to do it because I was feeling it
[52:18] that wasn't saying Lord give me this
[52:20] certain sign I never got the signs I
[52:21] waited I talked to cam afterwards I was
[52:23] gonna go over there and do it
[52:24] because I was fast and I was praying I
[52:27] was I saw the movement of the Holy
[52:28] Spirit when he saw the move of the Holy
[52:29] Spirit their God moving in the great way
[52:32] so I just want to encourage you Church
[52:34] that everything's right on time with God
[52:38] the rapture boban said will not be a
[52:40] second late God's not upset with you
[52:43] you know guys aren't upset with me he's
[52:45] not upset with his bride there's no
[52:46] condemnation then there in the bride yes
[52:50] we confess our sins we keep walking the
[52:52] light you know he forgives us to that
[52:53] but there's no combination condemnation
[52:55] to the bride of Jesus Christ God is
[52:59] lengthening the time the Bible said that
[53:01] he might save souls account that the
[53:05] long-suffering of the Lord is salvation
[53:07] the souls because God would that no man
[53:09] parish church I say like this God is
[53:13] weeping and crying like in his heart
[53:15] he's grieving he wants to see people he
[53:17] wants to see Muslims saved and he's
[53:19] patient and he's revealing himself to
[53:21] Muslims he's patient saving souls in
[53:24] China praise God he's patient while
[53:26] they're getting thrown in jail and
[53:27] persecuted he's patient he doesn't want
[53:30] anybody to be lost and so we've got to
[53:32] just be patient and wait for the coming
[53:34] of the Lord and do our part when one
[53:37] person rejoices rejoiced with them when
[53:39] one person suffers suffer will pray with
[53:42] them praise God and God will work
[53:46] everything out but remember our life is
[53:48] just a vapor we're not gonna be here
[53:51] very long either way you look at it
[53:53] whether the rapture happens that were
[53:55] changed or whether we die when it could
[53:57] be here very long it's just a vapor and
[54:00] we got to redeem the time while we have
[54:02] the time so I just want to encourage you
[54:05] with that you know God God is really
[54:09] moving you know humbly brother have said
[54:12] that third pole which we'll get to that
[54:13] little bit the third pole this last
[54:15] stage of the bride's ministry he said
[54:18] it'll be so great but it'll be so humble
[54:20] it's just gonna be amongst the bride
[54:23] members I know there's a ministry to the
[54:26] eternal laws - I understand that don't
[54:27] get me wrong I understand but it's so
[54:29] humble it's gonna be a small little
[54:32] group and we just got to be faithful to
[54:34] Christ praise God and we can be a part
[54:37] of it is that a blessing that we could
[54:38] be a part of it
[54:39] Lydia switch over here I just want to
[54:41] just show just want to show really one
[54:43] thing and I'm gonna leave this slide up
[54:45] here most of the time I just I want to
[54:49] just talk about rightly dividing the
[54:50] word of truth for the rapture just I
[54:52] just want to look at a few thoughts this
[54:53] morning and I'll set my timer here give
[54:56] me about an hour by God's grace so Lord
[55:10] willing tonight we'll look at numerology
[55:12] unless we have a visitor my co-worker
[55:14] said he may come if he comes he wanted
[55:17] to Bible study on patience I got a Bible
[55:19] study on patience ready to go I just got
[55:21] to be patient maybe he'll come maybe not
[55:24] he's gotta be patient but I have a
[55:27] sermon prepared on numerology it might
[55:29] be the last one I'm trying to cap it off
[55:30] tonight I hope I can cap off that series
[55:32] be done with that I want to move on to
[55:34] another series I want to finish purpose
[55:36] and I want to get I want to start a
[55:38] series on the entire life of Jesus
[55:40] Christ that would be a tremendous series
[55:42] but I want to get started on that
[55:43] because our ministry has to match the
[55:46] ministry of Jesus Christ so the more we
[55:48] look at Jesus Christ the more we see how
[55:50] we need to be now I understand we can
[55:53] look at the book of Acts - yes I agree -
[55:55] and you know all Paul's letters and I do
[55:57] but I want to really get to know the
[56:00] ministry of Christ even better because
[56:04] that's what we have to come back to the
[56:07] capstone has to fit perfectly on the
[56:10] bride of Laodicea on the great pyramid
[56:12] it has to cap it off and so it's got to
[56:14] fit perfectly it's got to be just like
[56:16] that we got to learn to wait upon the
[56:18] Lord we got to learn to do always that
[56:20] which pleases the father always move on
[56:23] and sister brother sister always want to
[56:26] please the Lord
[56:27] that's quite a that's quite a life it's
[56:29] quite a godly life so here's my title
[56:33] but I just want to look at the rapture
[56:34] like I said we had two things about the
[56:35] rapture yesterday so I just thought I
[56:37] would and I want to just look at these
[56:39] terms here and I just want to just I
[56:42] want to clear I want to rightly divide
[56:44] these just as a real brief kind of
[56:48] reminder of some of these so that we can
[56:51] be solid on them and you know some of
[56:56] these will be the scriptures we went
[56:57] over yesterday with brother amen and
[56:59] sister who and they request that Bible
[57:01] study if anybody needs a Bible say let
[57:03] me know I'll be happy to do that usually
[57:04] Saturday works the best for me but
[57:06] summertime I got other two other times
[57:08] three times too so I want to just I want
[57:12] to see you know there's there's these
[57:13] are really important terms to us how
[57:15] many to say amen to that
[57:17] but like we read in our text here there
[57:21] are some people that just they want to
[57:23] strive about words to no prophet and
[57:27] they want to the Bible said they they
[57:34] they're profane and vain babble they
[57:36] just want to babble behind the pulpit
[57:38] I'm not trying to be critical you know
[57:40] and I'm a of churches you know I'm not
[57:42] trying to be critical but but Jesus said
[57:45] few there be that find it and Paul said
[57:47] evil seducers or wax worse and worse all
[57:49] you got to do is go on YouTube and you
[57:52] know type in preachers and you'll find
[57:53] the big name preachers out there you
[57:55] know not an out message I'm just talking
[57:57] about the world you know the nominal
[57:59] churches and there a lot of them are
[58:01] just babbling things babbling jokes and
[58:03] babbling they're not really preaching
[58:05] the Word of God but Paul says don't let
[58:09] that be amongst you don't wrestle and
[58:12] argue words under no prophet in other
[58:16] words we've got to rightly divide the
[58:17] word so the people are profited so they
[58:20] benefit spiritually from the Word of God
[58:23] so I think I'll just start with the
[58:28] latter rain so go to since we're here in
[58:30] the New Testament go to James 5 6 James
[58:33] 5 the latter rain has only used one time
[58:36] in the New Testament and this is it
[58:39] James 5 6 and 7
[58:43] now the latter rain is a very scriptural
[58:46] word and
[58:48] fact these are the only two that are not
[58:50] scriptural words you won't find third
[58:52] Pole in the Bible and you won't find
[58:54] squeeze in the Bible so these three are
[58:59] clearly identified in Scripture and so
[59:02] we should know what they're about so you
[59:07] so you're profited by that that's what I
[59:09] can that's why I want to get out of this
[59:10] I've kind of mentioned it earlier I want
[59:13] you to profit from knowing the truth
[59:15] about these these things so there
[59:17] there's no one during the church I don't
[59:20] sit there and wondering wonder when's
[59:21] the third poll or what UN's the squeeze
[59:23] are a wonder if the seven thunders have
[59:26] uttered or a wonder what the Seventh
[59:28] Seal is in my life I don't sit there and
[59:30] wonder what I do wonder is that my
[59:32] pleasing my Lord and what does Jesus
[59:34] want me to do today that's what I wonder
[59:37] because I know I hope you can understand
[59:40] this I know that if I'm serving Jesus
[59:43] Christ with all my heart soul mind and
[59:44] strength all these things I'll take care
[59:46] of themselves ain't ahead all right now
[59:50] do I believe I know the truth about
[59:51] these yes I do
[59:53] but even if I'm wrong I always leave
[59:54] that little space out there even if I'm
[59:56] wrong I know if I'm loving Jesus Christ
[59:59] with all my heart and soul and I'm
[1:00:01] seeking first the kingdom of God all the
[1:00:03] physical things will be added and then
[1:00:04] all the spiritual things will be added
[1:00:06] as well all these mysteries remember you
[1:00:10] can understand all the mysteries and
[1:00:11] have not loved so when preachers are
[1:00:14] preaching some of these things and now I
[1:00:16] mean the message now when people have
[1:00:18] preaching these with the wrong spirit or
[1:00:20] they're trying to draw disciples after
[1:00:21] themselves it proves they probably don't
[1:00:24] have charity they probably don't have
[1:00:25] divine love because the mysteries and
[1:00:29] this is what I want to be I want to be a
[1:00:30] preacher that knows all the mysteries
[1:00:32] like first Corinthians 13 says but I
[1:00:35] also got divine love amen
[1:00:37] and that's what I believe the Bride of
[1:00:40] Christ will have I believe that with all
[1:00:41] my heart all my heart I believe that she
[1:00:45] has to because the mystery of God will
[1:00:48] be finished the Bible said in Revelation
[1:00:49] 10 7 so it's got to be finish someone's
[1:00:52] got to know that all the mysteries and
[1:00:54] some one also has to have all the divine
[1:00:56] love amen so that's what I want to be I
[1:01:00] want to be that I want to
[1:01:01] I want to preach it with God's love
[1:01:03] right which is a noise compassion
[1:01:06] remember God's love isn't always
[1:01:08] compassion God doesn't heal everybody
[1:01:09] right God doesn't do everything we want
[1:01:11] him to do but it's the will of God is
[1:01:14] the perfect love of God
[1:01:16] submitting like we run on we read it
[1:01:18] last Sunday where the RAM said the proof
[1:01:20] of God's love is that you're elected
[1:01:23] elected means called
[1:01:25] the proof that God's loves you is you
[1:01:27] heard this message he calls you that's
[1:01:30] God's love then Batman said but but God
[1:01:33] may commit you to death like he did Paul
[1:01:37] but man said God may commit you to
[1:01:40] sufferings like he did job that doesn't
[1:01:43] mean God doesn't love you
[1:01:44] it means God does love you but he wants
[1:01:47] to bring a certain testimony out of your
[1:01:49] life so he can use you as a witness on
[1:01:55] the day of judgment that's like a lot of
[1:01:57] thoughts going that way lately
[1:01:59] all of our lives are for that purpose
[1:02:02] that God can help us to testify of
[1:02:05] something to testify of some power of
[1:02:09] Jesus Christ in our lives amongst our
[1:02:11] family and friends and our communities
[1:02:13] that we can be a witness that God can
[1:02:15] use on the day of judgment I believe
[1:02:20] that's what what's happening here so the
[1:02:24] latter rain it's we used one time in the
[1:02:27] New Testament actually let's go to verse
[1:02:31] 7 James 5:7 be patient therefore
[1:02:34] brethren under the coming of Lord behold
[1:02:36] the husbandman waiteth for the precious
[1:02:37] fruits of the earth and have long
[1:02:39] patience for it until he received the
[1:02:41] early and latter rain so James is saying
[1:02:45] church calm down be patient just like
[1:02:49] your husband men just like the owner of
[1:02:51] the vineyard is patient he's been around
[1:02:53] the block a few times before right we've
[1:02:56] been around the block a few times we
[1:02:59] know God is going to bring forth the
[1:03:01] former rain and the latter rain it's
[1:03:03] gonna happen in the season just like the
[1:03:07] farmers they don't get worried you know
[1:03:08] they know the rain eventually gonna come
[1:03:11] or you know that they know eventually
[1:03:13] the season is going to get here
[1:03:15] because they've done it before and so it
[1:03:17] is with God right
[1:03:19] just as God harvested Jesus and the Old
[1:03:22] Testament Saints haha
[1:03:23] just as he Harvard their soul harvested
[1:03:25] their souls in the heaven he's gonna do
[1:03:27] the same for the New Testament hey I
[1:03:30] didn't see that before
[1:03:31] just as he Hardison that time he's gonna
[1:03:34] harvest this time amen
[1:03:36] he's done it before it'll come in a time
[1:03:38] and season now look at 8 verse 8 but be
[1:03:44] also patients to have us your hearts for
[1:03:46] the coming of the Lord draw-off 9 and I
[1:03:51] kind of want to end it with that thought
[1:03:52] but let me ride it real big on my paper
[1:03:54] here so I don't forget I don't want to
[1:03:58] forget that let me just write it I'm a
[1:04:00] circle real big there okay because you
[1:04:03] know yesterday I was working on the
[1:04:04] numerology but now all these thoughts
[1:04:06] are coming to me this morning so I
[1:04:07] didn't have time to put them all in the
[1:04:09] notes even got up at 5:30 didn't have
[1:04:10] enough time to get him on there so we
[1:04:15] see James says be patient brethren he
[1:04:19] says it twice in a row right verse 7
[1:04:21] verse 8 be patient brother they said be
[1:04:22] also patient stablish your hearts for
[1:04:24] the coming of Lord draws not verse 9 he
[1:04:27] says don't have grudges so against each
[1:04:28] other
[1:04:29] the judge is it before the door right it
[1:04:33] is that remind you of Jesus where he
[1:04:34] said behold I stand the door knock James
[1:04:37] says the judge is at the door and now
[1:04:39] the Bible says let her see he's knocking
[1:04:41] on the door right all you gotta do is
[1:04:44] open our hearts to him amen
[1:04:46] let him come into our lives it's all we
[1:04:49] have to do so the coming of the Lord the
[1:04:56] rapture is connected to the latter rain
[1:04:59] and we can all see that so brother bran
[1:05:03] tells us thus saith the Lord and I'm not
[1:05:05] gonna take the time to read it but you
[1:05:06] can read it's on the last three page of
[1:05:07] the church age book brother Graham said
[1:05:09] thus saith the Lord the fullness of
[1:05:11] Pentecost will be in the bride and he
[1:05:13] says latter rain is rapturing faith
[1:05:16] that's what we worked in looked at
[1:05:18] yesterday how do you define latter rain
[1:05:20] it's rapturing faith it's the faith God
[1:05:23] is going to give you to change your body
[1:05:25] amen it's a gift
[1:05:28] stay back it's a gift it's a revelation
[1:05:31] rogram says in the 1965 sermon he said
[1:05:34] the rapture is a revelation
[1:05:36] it's an unveiling God unveils the power
[1:05:40] God unveils the the anointing he gives
[1:05:43] us the anointing to in order to change
[1:05:46] our bodies now Jesus does it by the
[1:05:49] Trump right the Trump Paul said in first
[1:05:52] Corinthians 15 the Trump of God shall
[1:05:54] sound and that Trump will change our
[1:05:56] bodies so the anointing somehow the
[1:06:00] latter rain is somehow connected that
[1:06:01] Trump of course we know the shout
[1:06:03] already went out brother Ram sermon or
[1:06:05] messages I believe a shout still
[1:06:07] shouting around the world
[1:06:08] I believe the voice of the Archangel
[1:06:10] will be the voice of Michael now I could
[1:06:12] be wrong on this let me just say it
[1:06:14] plainly I could be wrong on this but I
[1:06:16] believe it's the voice of Michael the
[1:06:18] Archangel that will resurrect the dead
[1:06:21] Saints I believe that because Michael is
[1:06:24] connected to the resurrection of Moses
[1:06:26] in the book of Jude the voice of the
[1:06:29] Archangel but manses the voice like
[1:06:31] Lazarus heard to raise the Saints amen
[1:06:34] glory that's what I believe I could be
[1:06:37] wrong on that one but see I'm not
[1:06:39] striving about it to no profit you're
[1:06:41] still good profit but pay attention to
[1:06:44] the things that have thus saith the Lord
[1:06:45] that's how you're gonna profit you'll
[1:06:48] profit from idea but I'm saying you're
[1:06:49] gonna profit from the knowing the latter
[1:06:51] rain is thus saith the Lord now go to
[1:06:54] joel 2:23 brother Ram says the church
[1:06:57] age book twice I don't know why people
[1:06:58] so I do know why why people are against
[1:07:02] the church age book they're against it
[1:07:04] because it's got thus saith the Lord in
[1:07:05] it right Joe 2:23 lbrahim quotes this
[1:07:14] and he says it twice this these
[1:07:16] scriptures 23 to 26 is thus saith the
[1:07:18] Lord and I preaches three years ago and
[1:07:20] I said I'd like to put this and maybe
[1:07:22] I'll do it someday I want to put the
[1:07:24] vision of our church up here and the
[1:07:26] vision of our church is this right here
[1:07:28] this is the vision because the fullness
[1:07:30] of Pentecost must be in the bride and we
[1:07:33] all know we have we have part of
[1:07:35] Pentecost we got the same baptism right
[1:07:38] we're all baptized the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:40] we got the same in Godhead
[1:07:42] right we got the same communion we know
[1:07:45] wine feet washing but we want to see his
[1:07:48] more power right like an axe after three
[1:07:52] where they just raise up the pair
[1:07:54] paralyzed now that but that all has to
[1:07:56] be done by God's leading right so we
[1:08:00] know we're experiencing we've
[1:08:02] experienced a lot of restoration but not
[1:08:04] the fullness of it but the fullness will
[1:08:07] be in the bride and that's our vision to
[1:08:10] serve God so that God can work his
[1:08:13] fullness through us so one day maybe I
[1:08:16] like to put up here the vision and want
[1:08:18] to put this up here
[1:08:19] the former clattering that's our vision
[1:08:21] our vision is that keep serving God so
[1:08:24] he'll he'll pour out his reign amen
[1:08:26] upon his former reign upon us and his
[1:08:29] latter rain at the same time because the
[1:08:31] Bible says it comes at the same time joe
[1:08:35] 223 be glad then you choose i rejoice in
[1:08:38] the lord your god forth giving you the
[1:08:39] former rain moderately and he will cause
[1:08:41] to come down for you the rain the former
[1:08:44] rain and the latter rain in the first
[1:08:46] month program says thus saith the lord
[1:08:50] he said the fullness of pentecost will
[1:08:52] be in the bride according to this
[1:08:54] scripture and also 24 25 and 26 so 24
[1:08:58] and the floor shall be full of wheat
[1:08:59] that represents the word and the fat
[1:09:02] shall overflow with wine and oil wine
[1:09:04] represents stimulation of Revelation and
[1:09:06] oil represents the baptism with Holy
[1:09:08] Ghost so what kind of church is this
[1:09:10] that's going to get the latter rain a
[1:09:12] church who's got the Holy Ghost amen
[1:09:15] a church that wants to be just like Acts
[1:09:17] chapter two amen that's the kind of
[1:09:20] church that's our vision is to be like
[1:09:23] Acts chapter two because brother Branham
[1:09:25] said we're going to need more than Acts
[1:09:26] chapter two for the red tells that
[1:09:28] invisible Union which is true but we've
[1:09:30] got to go back to Acts chapter two in
[1:09:32] order to go up praise God we got to go
[1:09:35] back to Acts chapter two no way that
[1:09:37] will go up praise God see in other words
[1:09:39] we got to go back to the full power the
[1:09:41] full anointing the full dedication the
[1:09:44] full diligence of the book of Acts
[1:09:47] then we'll go up now it'll happen it's
[1:09:49] time so God's gonna lead us to that
[1:09:53] verse 25 and I'll restore to you see
[1:09:56] we're still in the restoration you might
[1:09:59] say well bro jest well the bride hasn't
[1:10:01] been fully restored yet well that's true
[1:10:02] not all of it but a lot of it has a lot
[1:10:06] of our doctrine looks just like the
[1:10:07] Bible and if not you better tell me
[1:10:08] Church because I've been trying to
[1:10:09] preach this this Bible right here and if
[1:10:12] I got something wrong that's not in the
[1:10:13] Bible you need to come and let me know
[1:10:14] by God's grace our doctrine is very very
[1:10:17] close we're waiting on that power we're
[1:10:21] waiting on that power are we going in
[1:10:23] doctrine absolutely we're going in
[1:10:25] doctrine
[1:10:25] we're still learning more about the ways
[1:10:27] of God and then we've learned about the
[1:10:29] church ages the book of Revelation and
[1:10:30] and all the things that God's showing us
[1:10:32] our purpose in life we're learning all
[1:10:34] these things but God is he started the
[1:10:37] restoration process he'll finish it at
[1:10:40] the rapture see I'll restore to you the
[1:10:44] years the locust has eaten the
[1:10:46] cankerworm program said that's an
[1:10:48] antichrist spirit and the caterpillar of
[1:10:49] the poem my gray army which I sent among
[1:10:52] you through those four anointings
[1:10:54] throughout the seven church ages Satan
[1:10:56] slowly bit away and shooed away all
[1:10:58] their fellowship and all their joy we
[1:11:00] looked at that a few weeks ago or when
[1:11:02] we preached on purpose those four bugs
[1:11:04] it's the same bug in four stages right
[1:11:07] but God is going to bring back all that
[1:11:10] they lost God's gonna bring back to us
[1:11:12] amen if we live to see it amen
[1:11:15] but either way we've seen a lot of
[1:11:17] restoration so far hey I don't like you
[1:11:21] but I have I know Karen has an lndian I
[1:11:24] know we've seen this because we got the
[1:11:28] doctor and we got the when we've seen
[1:11:30] americo's at least when we see how God's
[1:11:32] moving among us we're seeing the
[1:11:34] restoration it's not finished but each
[1:11:37] day a church it's getting closer amen it
[1:11:41] is it has to be just logically but the
[1:11:44] battles raged harder each day as well
[1:11:47] and that's where I'll be honest that's
[1:11:50] where some days where Satan will
[1:11:51] discourage me I'll go through
[1:11:52] discouragement and I'll be like oh we're
[1:11:55] not the brighter how can I be the
[1:11:56] brighter or mercy our church is
[1:11:58] struggling or or this church is
[1:12:00] struggling and
[1:12:00] discourages us but God always brings us
[1:12:03] out of that discouragement because when
[1:12:06] you get under the fresh anointing or the
[1:12:08] Bible said of transformation the
[1:12:10] renewing of your mind you can live with
[1:12:12] spiritual eyesight and now you can see
[1:12:14] that you've done the perfect will of God
[1:12:16] you struggled you've got ups and downs
[1:12:18] but overall picture you're flying over
[1:12:22] the things of the world with the Eagle
[1:12:24] anointing and you're feeding on the book
[1:12:26] the body word of the carcass of the
[1:12:28] fresh word of Jesus Christ amen
[1:12:31] you're feeding oh you're an eagle amen
[1:12:33] you come out of denominations I come out
[1:12:36] of that and we're facing on the body
[1:12:38] where the current word the current
[1:12:40] prophecy which is the rapture amen it's
[1:12:44] gonna happen through the rain through
[1:12:47] the anointing all about you but I want
[1:12:48] more anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:12:50] thanks got it because the anointing
[1:12:52] equals rain hallelujah amen when someone
[1:12:56] says oh you're just too much about the
[1:12:57] anointing no no the anointing is what's
[1:13:01] needed for the rapture praise God amen
[1:13:05] and if you ever get the right anointing
[1:13:09] it'll make you live the right way praise
[1:13:11] God
[1:13:12] see we don't want wildfire thank God
[1:13:15] wildfires better than no fire in other
[1:13:18] words some seals better than no seal but
[1:13:22] this bride is not going to heaven in a
[1:13:24] rapture with wildfire it's the eternal
[1:13:27] fire it's a consuming fire that's the
[1:13:30] fire that's taking us in the rapture
[1:13:32] amen it's exactly right ain't gonna be
[1:13:38] some wildfire play around think you
[1:13:40] might we might go through seasons like
[1:13:42] that we might have to deal with that you
[1:13:44] know I'd rather have someone who's a
[1:13:45] little more sales than someone who don't
[1:13:46] even care lays around it is new nothing
[1:13:48] for Jesus right you rather have that
[1:13:52] just trying to do something for the Lord
[1:13:53] and someone who's not even trying at all
[1:13:55] wasting around see so it's this
[1:14:00] anointing verse 26 Joel 2 26 and ye
[1:14:04] shall eat and plenty be satisfied and
[1:14:06] praise the name of the Lord your God
[1:14:07] that adult wonder see with you my people
[1:14:10] shall never be ashamed that is our
[1:14:12] vision if you ever wondered what
[1:14:14] my vision is for the church that is it
[1:14:16] right there a church brother amen where
[1:14:19] everybody satisfied
[1:14:21] everybody's happy praising the Lord a
[1:14:23] church when you're hungry there's always
[1:14:25] wheat to eat glory a church when you're
[1:14:30] thirsty there's always wine to drink
[1:14:34] thank you Jesus amen oh ma that's the
[1:14:41] kind of church that we want to be
[1:14:42] because brother Branham says this is the
[1:14:44] fullness of Pentecost thus saith the
[1:14:47] Lord now I got a little thought here go
[1:14:58] to Jeremiah 29 just so you know in the
[1:15:01] message desperation just kind of kind of
[1:15:03] came back to me mysteriously strangely
[1:15:07] Jeremiah 29 if you listen to the token
[1:15:16] that's brother Branham preached it I
[1:15:17] believe was June 63 for not mistaken but
[1:15:21] the evening service was desperations and
[1:15:23] it was a healing service and he starts
[1:15:27] off this Sturman and then he talks about
[1:15:30] how the token was one of the highlight
[1:15:32] messages of his entire ministry he said
[1:15:35] outside the regular Commission like the
[1:15:36] seals and the church ages
[1:15:38] he said because that's what caps off all
[1:15:41] the other messages glory the Holy Ghost
[1:15:45] is the capstone Amen the anointing amen
[1:15:49] God's life God's Spirit is the capstone
[1:15:52] and brother Han reads this now if you
[1:15:55] know Jeremiah 29 this was the letter
[1:15:57] that was written to the Jews who were in
[1:15:59] captivity and God was encouraging them
[1:16:02] saying at the end of 70 years I'm gonna
[1:16:04] visit you and I'm gonna bring you back
[1:16:06] to the land right all right now go to
[1:16:11] verse 10 29:10 for thus saith the Lord
[1:16:14] that's after 70 years be accomplished at
[1:16:16] Babylon I'll visit you and perform my
[1:16:19] good word unto you and causing you to
[1:16:20] return to this place for I know the
[1:16:22] thoughts that I think toward you say
[1:16:23] that the Lord thoughts of peace and not
[1:16:25] of evil to give
[1:16:28] expected and now we love this this is
[1:16:32] one of the most beautiful passages of
[1:16:34] Scripture God has God has literally lost
[1:16:38] in the tree he spiritually kicked his
[1:16:39] people out of the land because of all
[1:16:41] their abominations and part of the
[1:16:44] reason we'll get to tonight on the
[1:16:45] number seventy part of the reason is
[1:16:47] every seventh year they didn't rest and
[1:16:50] God said because of that you've done it
[1:16:53] for seven 490 years every seven years
[1:16:55] you haven't done it because of that
[1:16:56] you're gonna wait seventy years out of
[1:16:58] here so the land can rest you wouldn't
[1:17:02] rest spiritually you kept working and
[1:17:04] trying to make more money oh my it was
[1:17:08] the look at that tonight unless the
[1:17:09] patients got comes so God said I'm will
[1:17:13] let it rest you're not touching the land
[1:17:15] for seventy years each year you didn't
[1:17:18] let it rest each year you've disobeyed
[1:17:20] and this I turn my Sabbath and look at
[1:17:22] this today they just honor the baptism
[1:17:24] of Holy Ghost they they won't rest from
[1:17:27] their sinful works and be borned again
[1:17:30] so God's gonna keep the church out of
[1:17:32] the out for me in the variety what he
[1:17:34] already did right because they won't be
[1:17:37] born again they will honor God's Sabbath
[1:17:40] amen so he kicks him out from being the
[1:17:43] bride like Vashti and he gets him a new
[1:17:46] one
[1:17:46] Esther praise God glory the shining star
[1:17:50] the moon take the lower they hit yeah
[1:17:54] this is one of the most beautiful
[1:17:56] portions of scripture he said I know how
[1:17:58] I think about you Jewish bride I think
[1:18:02] thoughts of peace not of evil see many
[1:18:04] times we think God's upset with us
[1:18:05] Church God's not upset with you you've
[1:18:08] heard the call you've come out of the
[1:18:09] world you're elected all the other
[1:18:13] chickens stay in the chicken yard but
[1:18:14] you came out your eagle right
[1:18:18] he knows the thoughts he's there good
[1:18:21] thoughts for you now he says this verse
[1:18:28] to give me
[1:18:30] and so they want everyone they all would
[1:18:31] know what's the end of our lives gonna
[1:18:33] be it's gonna be that God is gonna bring
[1:18:36] you back to your promised land God is
[1:18:38] gonna return you to your inheritance hey
[1:18:42] man boy verse 12 then you shall call
[1:18:45] upon me and ye shall go and pray to me
[1:18:47] and I will hearken unto you God is
[1:18:49] letting them know I'm not gonna prayers
[1:18:51] really now I ask you know you'll do good
[1:18:53] things there but I'm really not gonna
[1:18:54] really answer your prayers until the 70
[1:18:59] years are up I still love you
[1:19:01] now what amazing God we serve what a
[1:19:05] loving God in other words about a
[1:19:06] minutes like this they spit in his face
[1:19:07] for 490 years they won't take any
[1:19:09] Sabbath's and he says I still love you
[1:19:11] though I'm still gonna give you a chance
[1:19:13] I'm gonna bring you back at the end of
[1:19:14] this that's love now look at verse 13
[1:19:21] and ye shall seek me and and find me
[1:19:24] when ye shall search for me with all
[1:19:26] your heart now if you listen to the
[1:19:30] desperation message brother Ram ends
[1:19:32] with verse 14 this is his text for
[1:19:34] desperation and I will be you say that
[1:19:38] the Lord and I will turn away your
[1:19:39] captivity and I'll gather you from all
[1:19:41] the nations and from all the places
[1:19:42] whether I've driven you say the Lord and
[1:19:44] I'll bring you again in the place where
[1:19:45] I've caused you to be carried away
[1:19:46] captive and brother Graham said back to
[1:19:48] Pentecost glory amen
[1:19:54] so see program says thus saith the Lord
[1:19:57] the fullness of Pentecost will be in the
[1:19:59] bride and then he preaches desperation
[1:20:01] God's gonna bring his bride back to a
[1:20:04] desperate state just like the attitudes
[1:20:06] they had on the day of Pentecost amen
[1:20:08] they're desperate we need the rain but
[1:20:11] he's got we need the Holy Ghost God's
[1:20:14] gonna bring us back to that praise God
[1:20:17] that's what this it's thus saith the
[1:20:20] Lord it's not my thought that's my
[1:20:23] vision and I share that brother Paul the
[1:20:24] Fontaine's and and he told me in the
[1:20:25] office he said I appreciate a man like
[1:20:27] you brother Jesse that can find prophecy
[1:20:29] and he said and stay with it that's what
[1:20:32] he told me because I preached it at
[1:20:33] their church to Joel chapter 2 verse 23
[1:20:35] 27 and some devoted all my life to
[1:20:38] teaching the Word of God to try to get
[1:20:40] ever to go back to Pentecost because
[1:20:42] you're not going to get back to
[1:20:43] Pentecost
[1:20:43] unless you got the right doctrine
[1:20:45] because doctrine is your instruction if
[1:20:48] you're teaching how to get back to
[1:20:50] Pentecost amen and the day of Pentecost
[1:20:52] it was repent and be baptized every one
[1:20:54] of you in the name of Jesus Christ that
[1:20:57] was the doctrine and ye shall receive
[1:20:58] the gift of the Holy Ghost amen they
[1:21:02] can't the the nominal churches can now
[1:21:05] get back to Pentecost without the right
[1:21:07] doctrine on the water baptism in the
[1:21:10] name of the Lord Jesus Christ because
[1:21:12] there's power in that name sins are
[1:21:14] remitted in the literal name of Jesus
[1:21:17] Christ amen and don't let anybody tell
[1:21:23] you that you you know we need we need a
[1:21:24] ninety more than doctrine you need we
[1:21:27] need both so go to a second
[1:21:29] John this was this was such a blessing
[1:21:32] in my heart I just want to share it with
[1:21:33] you second John chapter one don't let
[1:21:41] everyone out now church cross doctrine
[1:21:43] is always wrong you know this false
[1:21:45] doctrine is always wrong but the only
[1:21:46] that ever anyone ever tell you you know
[1:21:48] oh well don't worry so much about dr.
[1:21:50] know so what worry so much about the
[1:21:52] mysteries no no no no no yeah I mean if
[1:21:55] someone's like like let me just name a
[1:21:57] name like Geoff Jenkins let me just say
[1:21:59] okay just to if someone is on false
[1:22:02] doctrine and is pushy pointing you away
[1:22:04] from the message like Geoff Jenkins then
[1:22:06] yes you stay away from doctrines like
[1:22:08] that that's false doctrine but Jesus is
[1:22:12] very first doctrine was you must be born
[1:22:15] again according to both John chapter 3
[1:22:19] that's a doctrine and if someone's
[1:22:22] preaching mysteries wrong and yes that's
[1:22:24] wrong but the mysteries is what God has
[1:22:27] to reveal in order to finish the Great
[1:22:30] Commission and in order to give the
[1:22:32] bride the revelation she needs to go in
[1:22:35] the rapture amen we're not you know
[1:22:38] we're not getting in the rapture without
[1:22:39] the revelation of the mysteries and
[1:22:41] without the true doctrine of Jesus
[1:22:43] Christ amen we're not getting in the
[1:22:45] rugs without that because the Roger
[1:22:47] itself is a mystery Paul said so you
[1:22:50] can't even under you're getting on the
[1:22:52] rapture without having the revelation of
[1:22:54] the mystery of the rapture
[1:22:56] and you're not getting getting the
[1:22:57] mystery of the rapture without having
[1:22:58] the mystery of Christ in you the hope of
[1:23:00] glory even the Holy Ghost is a mystery
[1:23:06] so we need the mysteries yes we do we
[1:23:08] need the only thing we need to speak the
[1:23:09] word we need doctrine we need all that
[1:23:12] Jesus Christ is amen I've just heard a
[1:23:16] lot lately people saying Oh some people
[1:23:18] just go too far mysteries and go too
[1:23:19] deep on doctrine if you're a real Holy
[1:23:21] Ghost still Saint you'll never get wrong
[1:23:23] on that you'll always be right because
[1:23:25] that's the heart of Christ amen true
[1:23:29] doctrine is instruction from the heart
[1:23:31] of Jesus Christ the mysteries are what
[1:23:33] God say Moses said the mysteries are for
[1:23:38] you and your children the mysteries are
[1:23:40] God's special revelations for his family
[1:23:43] amen and the rest don't want it brother
[1:23:46] ant but we want it because it's given to
[1:23:49] us and your children and then even as
[1:23:52] many as the Lord our God shall call
[1:23:56] glory second John verse seven for many
[1:24:06] deceivers are entered in the world
[1:24:07] that's what we got today a lot of this
[1:24:09] even preachers who confess not that
[1:24:11] Jesus Christ has come in the flesh this
[1:24:14] is a deceiver and an antichrist
[1:24:18] I've never heard any you know preachers
[1:24:20] say Jesus Christ didn't come in a flesh
[1:24:21] body what I think this means now I could
[1:24:24] be wrong is that they deny that Jesus
[1:24:28] Christ is living in his bride in other
[1:24:31] words like we we don't have like just an
[1:24:33] anointing we got the seal of the Holy
[1:24:35] Ghost we have a part of God in us it's
[1:24:39] in our flesh do we still battle this guy
[1:24:43] oh yeah he's my worst enemy and he beats
[1:24:45] me from time to time
[1:24:46] but Jesus Christ has come in in flesh
[1:24:49] he's in his people because no no teacher
[1:24:54] is gonna say well Jesus didn't live in a
[1:24:55] a body of flesh nobody's gonna say that
[1:24:58] everybody knows that's the truth that's
[1:24:59] not gonna deceive anybody but if he says
[1:25:01] the false teachers say well well he's
[1:25:03] not really here and a many membered
[1:25:04] bride he's in all of his church and
[1:25:06] those people that believe the the
[1:25:09] william branham message oh they don't
[1:25:10] really have the holy ghost see they're
[1:25:12] denying that Jesus Christ has come in
[1:25:14] the flesh William Branham wasn't really
[1:25:16] truly filled with the Holy Ghost God
[1:25:18] really wasn't leading him there denying
[1:25:20] that Jesus Christ was with that man how
[1:25:22] do you know he's with him he preached
[1:25:23] the word and Jesus Christ is the word
[1:25:27] hey man second John verse 8 look to
[1:25:31] yourselves that we lose not those things
[1:25:33] which we have robbed that we receive it
[1:25:35] would have been a full reward another
[1:25:37] very good description for last week John
[1:25:39] saying keep looking after the thing he's
[1:25:43] got and keep keep a watch over the
[1:25:45] victories you have I'm sad I just keep a
[1:25:47] watch over all the saints that God has
[1:25:49] given our church that we don't lose any
[1:25:50] of them keep a watch over your joy that
[1:25:55] Satan doesn't steal it away amen
[1:25:59] keep over keep a watch over the things
[1:26:03] you've learned in the scripture or no
[1:26:04] Satan will steal away from your heart
[1:26:07] that's why I need to go over church I'll
[1:26:09] be honest you I've been I've been going
[1:26:11] back and listen to my sermons after I
[1:26:13] preached him not because I like what I'm
[1:26:14] preaching because it helps me to
[1:26:15] meditate on the Word of God well I'll go
[1:26:18] right to brother Branham all right go to
[1:26:19] Donnie regular I'll go right to Tim
[1:26:21] present a good temper message this week
[1:26:22] I got another word Church we got to keep
[1:26:25] our mind state on the Word of God we
[1:26:27] can't come here and let the word just
[1:26:29] pass over and forget it we've got to
[1:26:30] become the word that we're hearing it's
[1:26:33] got to build our confidence like brother
[1:26:35] dig said it's got it we got to learn to
[1:26:36] stay with God speak God's Word right
[1:26:39] believe God's Word and it'll build
[1:26:41] confidence in us we got to remember what
[1:26:43] God is telling us through the fivefold
[1:26:44] ministry see for reward we don't want to
[1:26:48] lose part of our reward remember lot
[1:26:49] light lost most of his family right a
[1:26:51] lot lost his wife he lost some of his
[1:26:53] reward
[1:26:53] but Abraham didn't lose nothing glory he
[1:26:56] was so far away from Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:26:58] they saw was smoke he didn't feel the
[1:27:00] heat he didn't even feel the thunders
[1:27:03] anti-death he was so far separated oh
[1:27:05] god help us to be a separated group amen
[1:27:08] separate from the things of the world
[1:27:09] praise God where we don't lose anything
[1:27:12] verse 9 here is verse 9 this is what so
[1:27:15] bless me whosoever transgresseth and
[1:27:18] abideth not in the doctrine of Christ
[1:27:19] hath not God can every see that you
[1:27:23] yeah keep the doctrine unless you got
[1:27:25] Jesus Christ
[1:27:26] you can't live the doctrine unless
[1:27:29] Christ is living in you hey Laurie
[1:27:32] that's why some of these people preach
[1:27:34] against doctrine because they can't live
[1:27:35] it they can't live it because Christ is
[1:27:39] not in them glory that's why the
[1:27:43] preacher like I mentioned earlier left
[1:27:44] the message
[1:27:45] all these preachers that leave the
[1:27:46] message they're doing that because they
[1:27:47] can't live it and after a while they get
[1:27:50] so upset and Satan will give him one
[1:27:52] little loophole program says it give
[1:27:53] them a little proposal too just to find
[1:27:55] a way out of it because they love the
[1:27:57] things in the world that preach I
[1:27:59] mentioned earlier I went on his YouTube
[1:28:01] page four years ago and he was posting
[1:28:02] Taylor Swift songs on his YouTube video
[1:28:04] or YouTube page now what kind of Holy
[1:28:06] Ghost film man would want to put a
[1:28:08] half-naked Jezebel lust machine like
[1:28:11] Taylor Swift on their YouTube page what
[1:28:13] kind of man do that see it exposes some
[1:28:18] things that are laying there some trash
[1:28:20] it never got clean out of the house oh
[1:28:22] maybe have a trash clean time a man
[1:28:24] where everything's clean up in this
[1:28:28] house amen
[1:28:30] see that's just an excuse the doctor was
[1:28:33] just an excuse cuz he can't live it
[1:28:35] because he still loves the things of the
[1:28:36] world and you watch anybody that falls
[1:28:40] away from this message go watch their
[1:28:41] life for a while and see they'll start
[1:28:44] dabbing a little more into it cuz now
[1:28:46] the churches they go to it's okay to
[1:28:48] watch those things it's okay to talk
[1:28:50] like it's okay because they love those
[1:28:53] things from the beginning but he glory
[1:28:56] that abides not the doctrine of Christ
[1:28:59] hath not God he that abideth in the
[1:29:02] doctrine of Christ he hath both the
[1:29:05] father and the son he's not the
[1:29:10] invisible spirit and the corporal body
[1:29:12] of Christ what's that mean
[1:29:17] that body in heaven is there to
[1:29:20] intercede for you based upon your
[1:29:22] profession amen you've got both the
[1:29:26] invisible spirit and the heart breeze as
[1:29:28] a body because you've kept the doctrine
[1:29:31] the instruction of that body Jesus
[1:29:34] Christ amen
[1:29:35] [Music]
[1:29:37] that's the reason they're so against the
[1:29:38] doctrine and holiness doctor like I
[1:29:40] wrote that book that's the reason
[1:29:41] they're against it that's reason they
[1:29:43] won't read it because it's the Holy
[1:29:44] Ghost behind it and they don't want to
[1:29:47] let the doctrine so they'll do anything
[1:29:49] they'll make any excuse to keep loving
[1:29:51] the things of the world is that true
[1:29:54] you better believe that's true the man
[1:29:58] that can't abide in the doctrine doesn't
[1:30:00] have Christ that's why they don't like
[1:30:03] doctrine that's why I say hello or about
[1:30:06] the mysteries and don't worry about the
[1:30:08] doctrine it's because they don't have
[1:30:09] Christ but the reason Jesus Christ came
[1:30:12] was to reveal his doctrine and reveal
[1:30:16] his mysteries let's go there revelation
[1:30:18] 10 let's go there Jesus Christ was the
[1:30:23] only one in heaven that could take the
[1:30:25] boat glory amen
[1:30:27] and what do you want to do brother
[1:30:28] William he wanted to take that book want
[1:30:30] to stay in heaven he wanted to come down
[1:30:32] to earth a man he wouldn't take that
[1:30:35] seven sealed book break it open and
[1:30:37] bring it down to heaven and reveal and
[1:30:40] finish the mystery of Donnie man huh
[1:30:43] bori it was another man it was Jesus
[1:30:47] Christ amen
[1:30:48] was it Mary the Virgin it wasn't Enoch
[1:30:51] it wasn't John the Baptist
[1:30:53] it wasn't William and it was Jesus
[1:30:55] Christ he's the only one worthy one amen
[1:30:58] he just gave it to the seventh angel cuz
[1:31:01] God always reveals it to the Angels
[1:31:03] because their messengers that's their
[1:31:05] name by definition of messengers angel
[1:31:08] revelation 10 now this will clear this
[1:31:11] up brother Branham said revelation 10 7
[1:31:14] is history
[1:31:15] that's already happened so verses 1 to 7
[1:31:18] are already history and right now 8
[1:31:20] through 11 is being fulfilled in you and
[1:31:21] I my brother Simon when he goes to Tyler
[1:31:24] and I brother Greg when he goes to Japan
[1:31:25] it's being fulfilled right now glory
[1:31:28] amen
[1:31:30] 1 2 7 s history 8 to 11 is current right
[1:31:34] now taking the revelation to every
[1:31:37] nation kindred tongue and people
[1:31:39] amen see all I gotta do is eat the book
[1:31:42] all y'all do is live the doctrine praise
[1:31:44] God
[1:31:45] just live it the hard services yeah the
[1:31:48] hard Wednesday nights why is it there
[1:31:50] keep eating the word keep becoming the
[1:31:53] word keep keep keep making Christ more
[1:31:57] control give him more preeminence in
[1:31:59] your life because if you don't it shows
[1:32:01] you don't have Christ and that is not by
[1:32:05] the doctrine doesn't have him you know
[1:32:13] revelation 10 I saw another mighty angel
[1:32:15] come down from heaven go over the cloud
[1:32:16] that's Christ and a rainbow was upon his
[1:32:19] head his face as it were the Sun and his
[1:32:22] feet as pillars of fire and he had in
[1:32:24] his hand a little book open see that was
[1:32:27] the book from heaven that was sealed
[1:32:28] with seven seals who's worthy to take
[1:32:30] that book Jesus Christ and he brought it
[1:32:33] down to earth and he has had a little
[1:32:36] book and he said his right foot upon the
[1:32:37] sea multitudes and left foot upon the
[1:32:39] earth and he cried with a loud voice is
[1:32:41] when a lion roars a lion is a prophet
[1:32:44] Amos 3:7 a lion roaring is a prophet
[1:32:47] prophecy glory and when he had cried
[1:32:52] seven thunders uttered their voices when
[1:32:55] the seven thunders none of their voices
[1:32:56] I was about to write and I heard a voice
[1:32:57] from heaven saying unto me seal those
[1:32:59] things which the seven thunders uttered
[1:33:01] and write them not and the angel which I
[1:33:03] saw stand upon the sea and upon the
[1:33:05] earth lifted up his hand to heaven and
[1:33:07] swear by him that liveth for ever and
[1:33:08] ever who created heaven and the things
[1:33:10] that therein are and the earth of things
[1:33:12] that are therein are and the sea and the
[1:33:13] things that are there and that there
[1:33:15] should be time no longer that means
[1:33:17] delay it was gonna be no more delay God
[1:33:19] is now finishing the mystery of God and
[1:33:21] it's going around the world ain't glory
[1:33:25] there's time no longer there's delay no
[1:33:27] longer this is the time for the open
[1:33:29] book to be taken around the world on him
[1:33:31] and all of the mysteries of God
[1:33:32] will be finished for the days of the
[1:33:35] voice to the seventh angel when he shall
[1:33:36] begin to sound asked me a man because
[1:33:38] God doesn't preach by angels
[1:33:40] he gives their words of instruction by
[1:33:42] angels but he don't preach mysteries the
[1:33:46] mystery of God should be finished as he
[1:33:47] hath declared to his servants the
[1:33:49] prophets now let me clear this up seven
[1:33:51] thunders there's a lot of quotes on the
[1:33:55] seven thunders brother Branham clears it
[1:33:58] up at the end of his ministry but if you
[1:34:01] listen before the end there's a lot of
[1:34:03] things he says like
[1:34:04] still waiting for the thunders so in the
[1:34:07] 6263 is like we're still waiting we're
[1:34:09] still waiting we're still waiting but at
[1:34:10] the end mother ram says the revelations
[1:34:12] in the seven seals are the seven
[1:34:14] thunders and that's the truth
[1:34:17] so brother man preached the first seal
[1:34:20] that was the first Thunder booming out
[1:34:21] so the revelation the White Horse and
[1:34:23] all these riders Rider and all these the
[1:34:26] the Beast that was all the first Thunder
[1:34:28] it has to be Church it has to be because
[1:34:32] lik bro they've said it's already
[1:34:34] history so the seven thunders are
[1:34:36] already under their voices and they
[1:34:38] utter their voices when the mystery of
[1:34:39] God was finished if you don't understand
[1:34:43] it then just say Lord thank you for your
[1:34:45] love thank you for your mercy help me
[1:34:47] not understand it someday but let me
[1:34:49] tell you the seven thunders uttered when
[1:34:52] Christ brought down the open seven
[1:34:54] sealed book to have a name not earth a
[1:34:56] man from heaven the seven thunders
[1:34:58] uttered when the book was brought down
[1:35:00] to the seventh angel
[1:35:01] they've already uttered they're the
[1:35:03] mysteries contained in the seven seals
[1:35:05] seven thunders seven seals it goes
[1:35:09] together and here's why it has to be
[1:35:12] that way because there's no seventh
[1:35:14] there's no mention of the seven thunders
[1:35:15] after this glory to the last time it's
[1:35:20] mention is when he brings the book down
[1:35:22] it's uttered and then the mystery of God
[1:35:24] which happens to be the voice of those
[1:35:26] thunders is taken around the world
[1:35:27] through missionaries they vary but see
[1:35:32] some people some of the quotes about the
[1:35:34] RAM says it'll be those sad of an
[1:35:35] unknown thunders that I'll get us ready
[1:35:37] for the rapture some people stumble over
[1:35:38] that and say see we don't have it you
[1:35:40] don't have it no we already got it
[1:35:42] because you can't make it something
[1:35:43] outside the Bible it has to be this
[1:35:45] right here revelation 10 that's the last
[1:35:48] mention of seven thunders see what is it
[1:35:51] doing this rightly dividing the word of
[1:35:52] truth right but even if people won't
[1:35:56] agree that's fine just keep praying for
[1:35:57] the latter rain then but I know this I
[1:36:00] do know this with all my heart the
[1:36:02] people that don't really take the seal
[1:36:05] seriously they get overthrown by Satan
[1:36:07] because Satan rides with this evil horse
[1:36:10] into their lives that's the power of the
[1:36:13] seven seals I've said it before I'm
[1:36:15] gonna keep saying it because I see it
[1:36:16] all the time now Satan
[1:36:18] rides in the people's lives we've seen
[1:36:19] people fall away we've seen people
[1:36:21] following and what happened they let
[1:36:22] Satan come in like a real deceptive way
[1:36:25] right into their life and it shows they
[1:36:29] don't they didn't hear the thunder of
[1:36:31] Christ he was thundering out beware of
[1:36:34] the light horse rider don't let him ride
[1:36:38] into your life amen
[1:36:39] glory they don't hear they just think
[1:36:43] well just learning an education it's
[1:36:45] more than that it's revelation it's
[1:36:49] recognizing Satan and every one of his
[1:36:51] tricks praise God and then it reveals
[1:36:54] your anointing to be an eagle and fly
[1:36:57] above all the horse rider down below
[1:36:59] here you Frye way above it and he can't
[1:37:01] touch you because you're in heavenly
[1:37:03] places in Christ Jesus that's the power
[1:37:07] of the funders each one thundered out
[1:37:09] God's will God's voice for each of the
[1:37:12] seven seals so don't be don't be don't
[1:37:17] be confused on this they already
[1:37:19] they were the revelations containing the
[1:37:21] seven seals because that's what
[1:37:22] revelation 10 says when the open books
[1:37:24] brought down seven thunders out of their
[1:37:26] voices it's already down to earth and
[1:37:29] the one the sevens already history amen
[1:37:32] does that help go to Revelation chapter
[1:37:35] 8 just so you know these are all things
[1:37:38] that we need to rightly divine
[1:37:39] revelation eight this seven seal is the
[1:37:42] literal second the rapture happens it's
[1:37:45] the day and hour of the rapture because
[1:37:48] all heaven went the seven seals loose
[1:37:50] then all heaven goes quiet because Jesus
[1:37:53] left so we have to wonder is the seventh
[1:37:57] seal open or not well part of it's not
[1:37:59] open because no one knows the day or the
[1:38:00] hour but part of it is open brother Adam
[1:38:02] said it's revealed to us we know what it
[1:38:04] is it's the hour of his coming name and
[1:38:08] he says that in feasts of trumpets he
[1:38:09] says it over and over again Christ to
[1:38:11] Mister God revealed he says it over and
[1:38:13] over again
[1:38:13] we know what the seventh seal is it's
[1:38:15] the literal day and hour is coming but
[1:38:17] no one knows that so it's still
[1:38:19] mysterious amen ah revelation 8:1 and
[1:38:26] when he had opened the Seventh Seal
[1:38:27] There was silence in heaven now you got
[1:38:29] you got those chat rooms that are crying
[1:38:31] holy holy
[1:38:32] and they shut their voices cuz Christ
[1:38:34] isn't there anymore
[1:38:35] he went down to get his bride amen glory
[1:38:39] they're not gonna just keep going holy
[1:38:41] holy and holy she's gonna say hold it up
[1:38:43] stop I'll be back a little bit by God
[1:38:45] well by my grace I guess he'd say hear
[1:38:48] you guys say say right there hold on I'm
[1:38:51] gonna go get my bride there's gonna be
[1:38:53] silence in heaven and that's the moment
[1:38:55] of the rapture to see these are all
[1:38:59] closely connected and we shouldn't have
[1:39:01] confusion on them we're not wrestling
[1:39:03] enough I'm not preaching this to fight
[1:39:05] with other preachers I'm preaching this
[1:39:07] so your profit on the things of God you
[1:39:10] won't worry about this what you're
[1:39:11] worried about is being faithful to what
[1:39:13] God's called you to do you'll work until
[1:39:16] Jesus comes amen
[1:39:18] but Bram said if you stop 15 minutes
[1:39:20] before the days over you get docked 15
[1:39:22] minutes of pay and he said it's the same
[1:39:24] thing for the rapture if you could take
[1:39:25] advantage this off the field he said if
[1:39:27] you stop your meetings you'll get docked
[1:39:28] in pay he says in other words you'll
[1:39:30] miss the rapture that'll prove your
[1:39:33] foolish version
[1:39:34] you've got to keep going keep planting
[1:39:36] he said don't change a thing keep that
[1:39:39] Holy Ghost gospel moving all on the
[1:39:40] world amen
[1:39:41] take it every nation eat the books wound
[1:39:45] up taking every nation prophesy again to
[1:39:48] every people nation tongue and kindred
[1:39:51] don't quit don't get all flustered up
[1:39:54] don't make yourself odd to be a
[1:39:55] Christian just be a solid Christian tell
[1:39:58] everybody how much you love Jesus I'm
[1:39:59] quoting mother Brandon he said don't try
[1:40:02] to figure things out he said just let
[1:40:04] the Holy Spirit do it see there's
[1:40:07] there's no confusion this is the
[1:40:09] anointing we receive right before the
[1:40:11] rapture this is the rapture the moment
[1:40:14] the thunders is the revelations that
[1:40:16] that the book art that the void that the
[1:40:18] book open book will helped us to hear
[1:40:20] all the seven voices of the revelations
[1:40:22] of the kid seven seals we didn't hear I
[1:40:26] hope you don't think that we didn't hear
[1:40:27] the voice of William Branham in the
[1:40:28] seven seals we heard the voice of Christ
[1:40:30] we are the voice of Jesus Christ that
[1:40:33] was Christ saying look I'm right here I
[1:40:36] can't be the wine horse rider John
[1:40:37] because I'm the one opening the word
[1:40:39] there can't be two persons there's only
[1:40:41] one person that was Christ
[1:40:44] bring out his voice so that we would
[1:40:48] know the revelation of the seven seals
[1:40:57] thank you Lord now those are the main
[1:41:05] things I just wrote dozens of extra
[1:41:06] notes I want to show here now the next
[1:41:09] one let's go up third pull now third
[1:41:12] pulls not in the Bible but signs is a
[1:41:14] better word three signs so go to Exodus
[1:41:17] chapter three because remember the angel
[1:41:20] said romancin how am I gonna pray for
[1:41:22] Kings and the angel said that you're
[1:41:23] just like Moses you're gonna be given
[1:41:26] three signs I don't know if he said two
[1:41:30] signs or three but we know brother I've
[1:41:31] had three poles so three signs
[1:41:33] I can't member the exact court ought to
[1:41:34] look it up I'm sorry that Exodus chapter
[1:41:37] 4 chapter 4 now in verses 1 to 5 he
[1:41:49] talks about casting the the rod down to
[1:41:52] the ground now verse 6 and the lower put
[1:41:56] further I'm starting said furthermore in
[1:41:58] him put now behind hand into thy bosom
[1:42:00] and he put his hand in his bosom when he
[1:42:02] took it out behold his hand was leprous
[1:42:04] as snow and he said putting on hand in
[1:42:08] that bosom again and he put his hand
[1:42:09] into his bosom again he plucks it out
[1:42:11] from his bosom and behold it was turned
[1:42:12] again as other flesh and it came to pass
[1:42:16] if they will not believe thee neither
[1:42:19] hearken to the voice of the first sign
[1:42:22] to the hand was the first sign or the
[1:42:25] first pole right they will believe the
[1:42:28] voice of the latter sign and it should
[1:42:31] come to pass if they will not believe
[1:42:32] also these two signs either hearken unto
[1:42:34] thy voice that thou shalt take up the
[1:42:36] water of the river and pour it on the
[1:42:37] dry land and the water which they'll
[1:42:39] take us out of the river shall become
[1:42:40] blood upon the dry land so it looks like
[1:42:44] there's three poles in there right or
[1:42:45] three signs so I'm sorry you have rod
[1:42:48] I'm sorry rod first second you have the
[1:42:51] hand and third pour in the water turn
[1:42:53] the water to blood so as Moses but the
[1:42:57] angel said as Moses given the
[1:42:58] two or three signs so you'll be given
[1:43:00] them to believe now what was Moses the
[1:43:02] prophet of the exodus out of a natural
[1:43:06] land amen what was brother man the
[1:43:08] prophet of the exodus from a spiritual
[1:43:11] condition to an eternal condition amen
[1:43:14] glory remember there's three exodus --is
[1:43:17] the first exodus from each of the
[1:43:18] promised land the second he said from a
[1:43:21] natural land to a spiritual and
[1:43:23] spiritual condition right which was
[1:43:26] Pentecost Pentecost was the second
[1:43:28] Exodus they left the natural things and
[1:43:30] came into a spiritual Kingdom and the
[1:43:32] last Exodus program said is going from a
[1:43:35] spiritual Kingdom into eternity amen
[1:43:38] oh yeah it's so when you think of third
[1:43:43] pole just change it to sign if you don't
[1:43:45] like the word pull change it to sign
[1:43:46] three signs now the interesting thing is
[1:43:49] is that the third sign brother Graham
[1:43:51] said involves you and I because he said
[1:43:53] the third pole will be used in a major
[1:43:54] way until the squeeze comes down and
[1:43:58] that's almost a literal quote from look
[1:44:00] away to Jesus so for some reason God
[1:44:04] allows this power the three poles of the
[1:44:07] messenger to continue on in this bride
[1:44:09] now I can't explain it by scripture yeah
[1:44:11] I'm sure a trusting God will show it to
[1:44:12] me one day but that third power has to
[1:44:16] be in the bride now see that means it
[1:44:19] has to be this it has to be the same
[1:44:20] thing it has to be because the former
[1:44:24] rain is teaching it literally says that
[1:44:26] in the Hebrew the former rain is the
[1:44:28] teaching rain of brother Branham the
[1:44:30] doctrine Laury Laury and the latter rain
[1:44:36] is the harvest rate or rapturing faith
[1:44:39] the faith we need for rapturing power
[1:44:42] amen
[1:44:43] so this poll is directly connected to
[1:44:47] ladder rain so these are like the same
[1:44:49] thing the third we can only do the third
[1:44:51] sign when we have the latter rain okay
[1:44:56] these are not all these separate things
[1:44:58] I wanted you to see they they're almost
[1:45:00] all the same thing the only one that's
[1:45:03] not is the squeeze but that's the one
[1:45:06] that's program gives us two scriptures
[1:45:08] for that let's go to Revelation 3:10
[1:45:11] that's
[1:45:12] first one now this is from the church
[1:45:14] age book which I have a lot of
[1:45:16] confidence in that I know it's not
[1:45:17] perfect I know it's not the Bible but
[1:45:18] it's the second greatest book I've ever
[1:45:19] read outside the Bible it is because if
[1:45:22] you can't understand the church ages you
[1:45:23] never gonna understand the seals if you
[1:45:25] never understand the seals Ram so you
[1:45:26] never understand the trumpets or the
[1:45:28] vows or the future home write the rest
[1:45:31] of the book of Revelation oh but I will
[1:45:33] understand all of it praise God the
[1:45:35] doctrine of it the anointing of it the
[1:45:37] rein of it the former reign of it oh my
[1:45:42] revelation 3:10 because thou hast kept
[1:45:45] the word of my patience I will also keep
[1:45:47] thee from the hour temptation which
[1:45:49] would come upon all the world to try
[1:45:51] them that dwell upon the earth well the
[1:45:53] Baron said that was the promise that if
[1:45:56] you keep God's Word with patience you
[1:45:58] won't have to
[1:45:59] you won't have to go there and either
[1:46:01] decide am I gonna live or die to take
[1:46:02] the mark of the beast he will keep us
[1:46:05] from that our temptation because you cut
[1:46:09] this word with patience there we go over
[1:46:10] patience for tonight well see if we're
[1:46:11] gonna preach that we'll see but the
[1:46:13] squeeze is all the political and
[1:46:16] ecclesiastical pressure that's gonna
[1:46:19] come down right before the rapture right
[1:46:21] before this or maybe while that's
[1:46:22] happening I don't know that's one thing
[1:46:24] we don't know okay so the squeeze is all
[1:46:29] this political pressure now I was
[1:46:31] telling my brother and sister yesterday
[1:46:32] in the Bible saying
[1:46:33] to me it has to be like a bowling pot
[1:46:36] where it slowly boils because the world
[1:46:39] is not going to know it they're not
[1:46:41] going to be ready for the rapture the
[1:46:42] Bible said they're like and they're like
[1:46:45] people that are going to get stolen in
[1:46:46] the thief or the night they're not gonna
[1:46:48] be aware of the rapture is gonna happen
[1:46:50] so the political pressure and the
[1:46:53] ecclesiastical pressure is going to
[1:46:54] slowly increase over the next year five
[1:46:58] years ten years fifty years no one knows
[1:47:01] the day or the hour but it's gonna
[1:47:04] slowly increase now we saw a little bit
[1:47:08] with Trump which I appreciate what he's
[1:47:10] doing I appreciate that he loves Israel
[1:47:12] but we saw right we got elected I
[1:47:14] preached it to you he signed a bill that
[1:47:16] allowed churches to have more Oh to have
[1:47:19] the ability to finance campaigns and I
[1:47:22] showed it here a few years ago he was
[1:47:24] last year the year before
[1:47:26] that's when the first bills he signed
[1:47:28] churches are now more free politically
[1:47:31] and that's just what Satan once
[1:47:36] well the RAM said the way it's gonna
[1:47:38] happen the churches are going to get
[1:47:40] such political power that they can move
[1:47:42] the government people the workers there
[1:47:44] which they're all sellouts almost all of
[1:47:45] them
[1:47:46] jellyfish sellouts not being critical
[1:47:50] but that's what they are they have no
[1:47:51] backbone for the word they're all
[1:47:53] dishonest most of them are dishonest not
[1:47:55] all but they're gonna pressure the
[1:47:58] leaders to make laws to outlaw you and I
[1:48:03] it's gonna be so slow it's good to me
[1:48:05] they're just gonna be like you know
[1:48:06] remember the earthquakes a few weeks ago
[1:48:08] in California it's gonna like this your
[1:48:10] shirt up by a few minutes you're certain
[1:48:12] about then you forget about it because
[1:48:13] you have you have life to live you can't
[1:48:15] worry about California all day you got
[1:48:17] to go to work I got to change babies
[1:48:20] diapers like I can't worry about
[1:48:23] California all day with earthquakes cuz
[1:48:25] I gotta live my life what's gonna be the
[1:48:27] same thing with this they're gonna have
[1:48:29] pressure and they're gonna hear violence
[1:48:31] Tina no this alone now if you don't
[1:48:33] belong this side side churches or shut
[1:48:34] down Church oh my that's a pretty so on
[1:48:36] Facebook they're getting the jokes and
[1:48:37] they'll forget all about it oh but we
[1:48:39] won't forget about it because we really
[1:48:42] want the church is that is forced to
[1:48:44] stop preaching if we're alive at that
[1:48:46] time it's gonna blow up cuz well they
[1:48:49] made had a good thought because he said
[1:48:51] what about Jesus where he said there's
[1:48:53] gonna be two in a bed I'll take one
[1:48:54] leave one there'll be two in a field
[1:48:56] I'll take one and leave one see the
[1:48:58] bride will be going about her regular
[1:49:00] regular work because it's gonna be a
[1:49:03] slow increase we'll keep going about the
[1:49:07] things of our life will be pretty
[1:49:08] stirred up here on Wed Sunday did you
[1:49:10] see that happening things you see that
[1:49:11] praise God the rapture is gonna be soon
[1:49:13] raising our but we'll keep going back to
[1:49:15] work we'll keep meeting like brothers o
[1:49:18] co-worker you really got to come to
[1:49:20] church now o come Holy Roller leave me
[1:49:23] alone yeah yeah left me alone all these
[1:49:25] thirty years you know no really this
[1:49:27] might be the time of the rapture and
[1:49:28] will almost be like Noah right Noah's
[1:49:31] family was like it's gonna close pretty
[1:49:33] soon you need to come get in the Ark in
[1:49:35] the back I'll come on I'll have time to
[1:49:36] get saved next year come on
[1:49:39] now our arc is Jesus Christ Mary's God
[1:49:44] will be going through the same thing
[1:49:46] they did because we're walking where the
[1:49:48] Apostles have trod amen
[1:49:51] see it's just gonna slowly boil up and
[1:49:55] get more difficult for us not for them
[1:49:57] they love the things of the world
[1:49:59] they're gonna be dark it's not gonna huh
[1:50:02] Facebook I'm gonna keep scrolling like
[1:50:04] on their Facebook page yeah huh well
[1:50:07] Jeff sees no longer preaching I'm not
[1:50:09] surprised Holy Roller thought he was
[1:50:12] better than everybody honestly that's
[1:50:17] right that's how we feel like when the
[1:50:20] people get arrested that need to be
[1:50:21] arrested like it's about time they got
[1:50:22] arrested put him in jail lock him up cuz
[1:50:27] I know which side they're on and I know
[1:50:28] it's I'm on I'm on Christ siding the
[1:50:32] Lord hallelujah so see they don't really
[1:50:36] care about our side and I care about
[1:50:38] them but I just thank God God's doing
[1:50:40] justice now revelation 13 program said
[1:50:44] the Holy Spirit said pick up your pen
[1:50:46] and write and he said revelation 13:16
[1:50:49] he said I believe according to
[1:50:51] revelation 13:16 that the true Bride of
[1:50:54] Christ will be forced to stop preaching
[1:50:56] the Word of God he said the Holy Spirit
[1:51:00] told me to say that now I'm not saying
[1:51:03] every word and there's a prophecy
[1:51:04] because and this is why because there's
[1:51:06] no less say at the Lord at the end but I
[1:51:10] believe there's inspired words in there
[1:51:11] so this is our second scripture for the
[1:51:14] squeeze and he causes all both small and
[1:51:17] great rich and poor free and bond to
[1:51:19] receive a mark in their right hand or in
[1:51:21] their foreheads now that's I think
[1:51:23] that's a for our sermon spoken word
[1:51:24] original C 1962
[1:51:25] I appreciate years ago I preached just a
[1:51:27] whole series on fast forward to the last
[1:51:30] or and you'll hear about them say this I
[1:51:32] believe a quarter revelation 13:16 that
[1:51:34] the bride will be forced to stop
[1:51:36] preaching doesn't say squeeze he calls a
[1:51:37] boycott they'll boycott our churches
[1:51:42] they say oh you can't have church
[1:51:44] they'll lock our doors
[1:51:45] he said because well she'll be forced to
[1:51:50] stop preaching because she preaches
[1:51:51] against all their nonsense
[1:51:53] and brother I said Jesus won't like it
[1:51:56] so he's gonna be real mad that
[1:51:58] he's gonna come take his bride and judge
[1:52:01] the see he's fighting for you
[1:52:06] praise God he wants you to overcome he's
[1:52:08] gonna blow around all those who
[1:52:10] persecute this way cuz it's his word and
[1:52:13] will his life amen
[1:52:15] any man that's half a man will stand up
[1:52:18] for his family let alone his wife his
[1:52:21] beautiful brand-new wife Lori like the
[1:52:24] mother bear will fight for her babies
[1:52:25] how much more will Christ fight for his
[1:52:27] wife what do you mean you he's saying
[1:52:31] you can't make my bride stop preaching
[1:52:33] that's fine it works in my playing
[1:52:35] anyway honey come here now I'm gonna put
[1:52:37] all judgment upon them honey come here
[1:52:40] I'm gonna snatch you oh that's what it
[1:52:41] means the word caught up means to snatch
[1:52:44] away violently he's gonna come down here
[1:52:49] and he's gonna snatch her away she's
[1:52:52] gone where'd she go where she go she
[1:52:54] went to be with her Lord she went to her
[1:52:57] wedding glory your wedding in the sky
[1:53:01] hallelujah that's right Church so that's
[1:53:05] what the squeeze is it's this tension
[1:53:07] it's gonna be very slow now could be
[1:53:08] fast but that's what I believe
[1:53:10] I bet it'll be very slow the world will
[1:53:12] be saying peace and safety peace and
[1:53:13] safety peace and safety and the Bible
[1:53:16] say you don't worry about it because you
[1:53:17] know the times and seasons hide you know
[1:53:19] the time that scene where they meant cuz
[1:53:21] brother man told us the times and
[1:53:22] seasons he told us the times the seasons
[1:53:25] we'll know we'll see them going so far
[1:53:28] too far to try to stop the bride from
[1:53:30] preaching but will see us rising up in
[1:53:32] the book of Acts type of faith yes so
[1:53:37] let me try to close now I tried to
[1:53:39] preach about everything I put on my
[1:53:41] notes here as it helped today let me say
[1:53:46] a few more things and then I'm gonna get
[1:53:47] that established thought we are not
[1:53:49] looking for a national revival because
[1:53:52] motor ham said the last call already
[1:53:53] went to the US the state the Lord we're
[1:53:58] not looking for any other sign for the
[1:54:00] rapture because program said the last
[1:54:03] sign is already given it was his
[1:54:04] discernment
[1:54:05] like God gave to a
[1:54:07] right before Isaac arrived so the son of
[1:54:11] man ministry brother branham was the
[1:54:12] last sign brother BAM said to the
[1:54:14] Gentiles thus saith the Lord so we're
[1:54:17] not looking for a sign for all the
[1:54:18] Gentiles what we're looking for is for
[1:54:21] our condition to get in the right
[1:54:23] condition where the Bible says we're
[1:54:27] looking unto Jesus the author and
[1:54:29] finisher of our faith we're looking to
[1:54:31] Jesus Christ saying Lord make me ready
[1:54:33] Lord am I ready God washed me made me
[1:54:35] right that's what we're looking for
[1:54:37] we're looking to Christ to get us in
[1:54:40] position to go but I was looking unto
[1:54:44] Jesus remember ok Hebrews chapter 12 we
[1:54:47] are looking unto Jesus Christ the author
[1:54:50] and finisher of our faith now go to
[1:54:51] Revelation 3 this is real familiar but I
[1:54:53] want to go over this if you wonder what
[1:54:55] your condition and my condition needs to
[1:54:57] be it's right in Revelation it's the
[1:54:59] opposite of Laodicea right so whatever
[1:55:03] Jesus read there's my hour - I'll finish
[1:55:05] your instrument whatever Jesus rebukes
[1:55:08] the layers in church age we got to be
[1:55:10] the opposite of that that's the sign I'm
[1:55:15] looking for brother Aaron is from my
[1:55:16] life to be more like what Jesus wants a
[1:55:19] hot on fire life a book of Acts church
[1:55:21] life that's what I'm looking for I'm not
[1:55:26] looking I mean we look at Israel but
[1:55:27] thank God for that you know we we see
[1:55:28] that she's in her position praise the
[1:55:30] Lord you know if we get to see the
[1:55:32] temple rebuilt hallelujah that'll give
[1:55:34] us even more zeal but if we know it's
[1:55:36] okay because we're seeing the Statue of
[1:55:38] a perfect man built we're seeing God's
[1:55:42] real body be built Paul said that we
[1:55:46] were built upon the foundation of the
[1:55:47] Apostles amen
[1:55:48] Jesus Christ the chief Cornerstone he's
[1:55:51] the cornerstone and the capstone Tina -
[1:55:53] America first of the last hallelujah
[1:55:56] right revelation 3:14 now let's go down
[1:56:04] to verse 15 I know that works without
[1:56:06] neither hot or cold I would that that
[1:56:07] work called a hot so we've got to have
[1:56:08] hot works now hot means boiling we got
[1:56:11] to have like continual activity with our
[1:56:14] works
[1:56:15] that means I'm continually praying right
[1:56:17] I'm continually reading my Bible I'm
[1:56:18] continually going to church I'm content
[1:56:20] they testifying to the milk the milkman
[1:56:22] or whatever here the mailman you're just
[1:56:25] boiling you're moving all the time doing
[1:56:27] something for the Lord
[1:56:29] so because thou art lukewarm and neither
[1:56:31] cold nor hot I will spue thee out of my
[1:56:32] mouth
[1:56:33] they can't notice they can't be the
[1:56:34] mouthpiece of Christ they can't speak
[1:56:36] the word of Christ verse 17 because
[1:56:39] they'll say us I'm rich and increased
[1:56:40] with Goods and have you nothing now so
[1:56:42] see what do we say then we say I'm poor
[1:56:46] of spirit because blessed are the poor
[1:56:48] in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of
[1:56:50] heaven ha ha ha
[1:56:54] how rich we are they're bragging how
[1:56:55] rich they are we say Lord I need more of
[1:56:57] you I'm increased with Goods look how
[1:57:03] look at all my goods I got and we're
[1:57:05] like we need to get rid of it because we
[1:57:07] need to have more spiritual Goods right
[1:57:10] don't you fight I constantly fight that
[1:57:12] trying to keep my house clean people
[1:57:15] just my mother my mother will send a bag
[1:57:16] of clothes I'm like oh my she'll carry
[1:57:18] the baggage little Mike Oh increase with
[1:57:21] Goods and have need of nothing
[1:57:22] help me Jesus yeah my grandma Tammy will
[1:57:26] throw in all these new toys at my elbow
[1:57:27] here we go trying to keep the house
[1:57:29] clean because it's increased with goods
[1:57:32] we got to be the opposite try to get rid
[1:57:34] of what we can so we can serve the Lord
[1:57:35] and have need of nothing so see they say
[1:57:40] we don't need more Holy Ghost we they
[1:57:42] say we need more Holy Ghost there's one
[1:57:45] thing I need more of Jesus Christ amen
[1:57:48] more death to myself but they're saying
[1:57:50] we don't need anything we got everything
[1:57:52] we're good having our millennium right
[1:57:53] now on the earth you guys say no this is
[1:57:55] not our home we want more of the word
[1:57:57] more death to self more obedience we
[1:58:00] want more of Jesus Christ see we say
[1:58:03] that so our condition has to be the
[1:58:04] opposite I constantly me to buy me gold
[1:58:08] try the fire code is time-tested faith
[1:58:11] because Peter says you're you're tested
[1:58:13] faith is more precious than gold that
[1:58:15] perishes so we're gonna have gold faith
[1:58:19] right like deity we're to see the deity
[1:58:21] of Christ manifested through our faith
[1:58:24] right cry in other words Christ is gonna
[1:58:27] live through us and give us overcoming
[1:58:28] faith yeah the fires of affliction we
[1:58:33] had to go we have to go through
[1:58:34] fires of affliction and go through them
[1:58:36] and overcome with faith that thou mayest
[1:58:40] be rich and white raiment that thou
[1:58:44] mayest be clothed now raiment mother
[1:58:45] says what is Raymond said it's eternal
[1:58:47] life so you got to be born again and it
[1:58:50] represents the righteous of saints so
[1:58:51] when you're born again with the Holy
[1:58:52] Ghost you do the right things
[1:58:54] that's righteousness of faith and that
[1:58:58] the shame of thy nakedness do not appear
[1:58:59] and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve
[1:59:01] about man see so Paul says the eyes of
[1:59:05] your and light that I Lightning of your
[1:59:07] eyes be opened so you can see
[1:59:09] spiritually so when your eyes are
[1:59:10] anointed with the Holy Ghost you can see
[1:59:12] that it's not it's not it's not
[1:59:14] nighttime for us it's daytime for us we
[1:59:17] can see it's the season of the rapture
[1:59:19] praise God we got the whole armour of
[1:59:21] God on we got the full armor of God
[1:59:23] we got the sword of the king see we can
[1:59:26] come against any lust we come against
[1:59:28] any greed any fear we can come against
[1:59:31] that sickness we come against in the
[1:59:33] name of Jesus Christ
[1:59:35] so we got iced out we can see what's
[1:59:37] happening we're not blinded the Bible
[1:59:39] said the god of this world has blinded
[1:59:40] the minds of them that don't believe as
[1:59:44] many as I love I rebuke and chasten be
[1:59:46] zealous therefore repent we got to be
[1:59:48] quick to repent we got to be able to be
[1:59:51] able to quickly say Lord I'm sorry
[1:59:52] forgive me now let's stand I'm gonna get
[1:59:55] a few more scriptures I stand here as
[1:59:56] I'm closing I got two scriptures well
[1:59:59] I'm one one I'm gonna read Hebrews five
[2:00:02] again what the Bible say about the
[2:00:06] latter rain it said this I'm sorry James
[2:00:08] 5 sorry oh it's been good to be
[2:00:14] the church in the hostel or today the
[2:00:18] Bible said be patient for the latter
[2:00:20] rain establish your hearts for the
[2:00:23] coming of Lord Rolf 9 that means to
[2:00:25] stabilize and strengthen what do you
[2:00:28] need to be ready for the rapture a
[2:00:29] strong heart a heart that's unmovable
[2:00:33] he said establish your hearts right now
[2:00:37] you could interpret that as your
[2:00:39] emotions or it could be the soul of man
[2:00:42] right don't let your emotions be to be
[2:00:45] swayed but you set your affection on the
[2:00:47] things of God
[2:00:48] only care about and cry about and be
[2:00:51] happy about the things of God or it
[2:00:54] could mean the soul right it could mean
[2:00:58] that establish your soul in other words
[2:01:00] be sealed to the day of redemption
[2:01:03] strengthen your heart everything that
[2:01:05] you have believe with all your heart now
[2:01:07] the last one turn there Romans 16 now
[2:01:09] this is what I wanted to bring out to
[2:01:10] close so you know the rapture ladder
[2:01:16] rain and mysteries all go together no
[2:01:18] one's going the rapture without the
[2:01:19] revelation of the mysteries I'll tell
[2:01:21] you that right now
[2:01:22] that's scriptural no one's going the
[2:01:25] rapture without the revelation of the
[2:01:26] mysteries that's why Jesus Christ came
[2:01:29] back to reveal the mysteries now look at
[2:01:33] this look at verse 25 Romans 16:25 it's
[2:01:35] scriptural it's totally totally Bible
[2:01:37] now to him that is a power to stablish
[2:01:41] you what did James say you want you're
[2:01:46] waiting for that rain what'd he say
[2:01:47] establish your heart so paul is saying
[2:01:49] the same thing years later this is 20
[2:01:53] years later because it's all the same
[2:01:55] spirit praise God the same author really
[2:01:57] wrote the whole Bible he said but now to
[2:02:01] him that's power established you
[2:02:02] according to my gospel and the preaching
[2:02:04] of Jesus Christ according to what what
[2:02:06] is the preaching of Jesus Christ
[2:02:08] according to according to the revelation
[2:02:11] of the mystery which was kept secret
[2:02:14] since the world began amen glory your
[2:02:18] heart is only strengthened based upon
[2:02:21] the revelations you receive from the
[2:02:23] Bible amen
[2:02:25] hallelujah some people go overboard on
[2:02:30] mysteries which means they inject false
[2:02:32] doctrine
[2:02:32] some people go overboard on doctrine
[2:02:34] that means they were never born again in
[2:02:35] the first place but anyone who's ever a
[2:02:37] part of the rapture will have the true
[2:02:39] understanding of the mysteries and will
[2:02:42] live the doctrine of Jesus Christ
[2:02:46] because it's God's doctrine it's God's
[2:02:49] life can I say like that it's God's life
[2:02:52] this is his way to live see but now I
[2:02:56] was made manifest and by the scriptures
[2:02:58] of the prophets according to the
[2:03:00] commandment of the everlasting God made
[2:03:02] known to all nations for what
[2:03:05] why did wise is revealed to us for the
[2:03:07] obedience of the faith the bride is the
[2:03:10] only group on the earth that obeys God

[2:03:18] ones that really obeying Jesus Christ

[2:03:22] mysteries of God That's not me Church

[2:03:29] down seven thunders or other voices and
[2:03:31] then a messenger takes it and finishes
[2:03:33] the mystery of God and then takes it
