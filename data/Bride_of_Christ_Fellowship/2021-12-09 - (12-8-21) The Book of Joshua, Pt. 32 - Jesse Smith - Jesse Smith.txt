at joshua part 32 so let's turn to genesis chapter 30 verses 22 through 24. genesis 30 22. these are the birth scriptures of course of joseph we're willing tonight we'll look at joseph benjamin and then go a little bit further in the book of joshua right now we're in chapter 18 and 19. we've been kind of staying on that as these uh tribes of israel are given their promised possession uh that was given some 400 years previously genesis 30. everyone want to read with me here okay everybody can read i'll let my children read with me okay let's read verses 22 23 and 24. i just didn't know if everybody's okay with that all right let's begin on three three verses 22 23 24 ready one two three and god remembered rachel and god hearkened to her and opened her womb and she conceived and buried son and said god hath taken away my reproach and she called his name joseph and said the lord shall add to me another son let's have one more word of prayer if we can here let's remember the sick and afflicted here and also remember the other knees there's a lot of sick ones here tonight that's our hands here for word prayer heavenly father again we just come we read your holy word we thank you for this living word god it's our living hope lord jesus thank you for the holy spirit lord which is the life of jesus's blood that's here today to wash us god to keep our robes white and clean lord god as we have eternal life in our souls by the baptism of the holy ghost we're bought with the price the precious blood of jesus lord you send your spirit into our hearts crying abba father thank you god for your holy spirit lord god we look to you father o god tonight lord from the word of god to pray speak to us god just lead me guide me anoint me and lord let your people receive lord that which they have need of lord i stand in need of you lord god and i know each and every person does as well so we commit this service this portion of the service into thy hand oh god i just pray you speak to us by your mercy in jesus christ's name whatever he said amen god bless you for being seated so i guess i could use some readers children because we'll be looking at some of the uh birth scriptures and uh prophetic scriptures so looking at part 32 here uh tonight of joshua and we're willing we'll see you know what the lord leads us to minister on this weekend uh whether we'll look back in this series or perhaps lord willing go back to the freedom from bondage i think we've got three three messages on that of course didn't finish that but as i was preparing today i just kind of felt pulled here to go back to uh the book of joshua let's kind of recap a little bit you know we've done 31 sermons now 32 uh with the remaining chapters are going to look like this you know we're in chapter 18 and 19 where the tribes begin receiving their promised lot some 300 to 400 years after they were prophesied of by both their father and then not long before that then was moses that prophesied of him as well as we are looking at 18 at the end of chapter 18 benjamin receives his lot we'll actually look at benjamin here tonight lord willing chapter 19 uh the lots are given to the remaining six tribes and then josh was given a gift of inheritance we kind of looked at that additionally as we looked at joshua's tribe judah and how he was given a special portion in judah because of his faithful service to the lord in the remaining chapters there's only five chapters chapters left rather after this uh chapter 20 is on the cities of refuge chapter 21 is the cities of the levites among their tribes god's faithfulness to israel and keeping all of his promises chapter 22 is about joshua's words to the two and a half tribes on the east of jordan and then there's a little bit of confusion followed by peace regarding an altar set up by that by these two and a half tribes and then chapter 23 a summons by josh reminding of blessings or cursings in the land then the book ends in chapter 24 with another summons by joshua urging israel to make their choice and then we are told about joshua's death so that's the conclusion to the book of joshua and lord willing we're going to try to preach through all that lord willing if god would help us it's been just a tremendous series here i've learned so much i've grown so much as a christian and hopefully we feel stronger now that we've been preaching this series this year because we see ourselves as uh spiritual israel right possessing our promised land in the baptism of the holy ghost the third work of grace and in other words beginning this adoption process we know it's not finished until we get a new body according to book of romans uh to it the redemption of our body that's to it is that is the redemption of our body that's the the fullness or completion of adoption but as we are living in this world we should possess many promises of god all the promises of god are yea and amen and we do that by the grace of god and also yielding our human will to the will of god and we know it's uh it's the love of god working in us because paul says faith with which works love i believe in galatians five verse six so each day we've got to humble ourselves uh die to ourselves and live from the love of god in our soul and that love will inspire our faith and that faith will work for the kingdom of jesus christ each and every day not just sunday like a lot of churches not just wednesday but each and every day as we seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness then everything else will be added unto us how many want to be righteous praise god you want christ's own righteousness that only comes through obeying the holy spirit praise god and living a life pleasing unto the lord we know it's possible and so we thank the lord for that so i just want to also briefly review again this quote from as i was with moses 1960 brother branham said a very beautiful type of what we need a joshua for today the trouble today when we're coming to our promised land god wants to raise sheep like ephraim and one wants to raise something like the other every man wants to be the same let god give one man a gift to healing every man wants to get to healing ephraim and god and all of them wants to mix all them come with one but we are divided in our position all don't have the gift of wisdom all don't prophesy all don't speak with tongues all are not prophets but god has sent the church some that prophesy some that speak it with tongues we want to make them all speaking in tongues of course that's pentecostal but see how the confusion is then you can't get nowhere he said god give us a joshua god give us a joshua that will hold the commission with the word so one major emphasis of this series is for us to be baptized with the holy ghost find our position and be who god made us to be as brother adam said we can't be something that we're not or ain't or hate whatever he said it uh we want to be what god made us to be now of course church you know at some point we'll find somebody else with our same gifting right so and we can actually learn from them you know we can learn from them especially if they're an older christian the lord we can if our gift is wisdom or our gift is tongues or or miracles whatever it is we can learn from that individual um but of course we wouldn't copy uh that person in every little aspect you know god may have uh you know maybe a larger uh portion of the gift for that individual uh maybe it's larger in our life you know so we've just got to be aware of that my question is i'm sorry my connection's unstable so let me see if i can friends i may slide the camera back a little bit it's kind of unstable maybe towards our router so just bear with me here so hopefully that will get a little bit better we'll see how this kind of pans out the screen says it's uh please wait while we we try reconnecting so what's that just go okay so my children think i should just go so i'll just go all right you think it'll record okay well praise the lord hopefully it'll record by god's grace so um again we see that god sets us in our land and we want to be content with our land and the way to find that is seek the lord the bible says seek the lord while he may be found and of course that means before the lord would come but also before a person may turn and take a reprobate heart which would be the worst kind of heart someone could have a reprobate mind rather where god gives them over to believe a lie be damned by it in other words while we have this window of a long in our hearts a window that we want to seek the lord oh with all of our hearts we should seek that and then always continue i'm talking about generally to all people everybody has this window where they have to choose to seek the lord or deny the lord i actually read about romans 1 this morning that was my chapter about how they did not like to retain god in their knowledge so god give them over the strong deluge and reprobate mind to do the things that are not and so the wrath of god rests upon those people but thank god that you and i have uh accepted the lord's invitation thank god we've heard the knock praise god uh from the laodicean church age he stands the door knocks and thank god we're supposing with him tonight praise god we're out here just you're not watching just to be a religious act but we want to sup with the lord we want to feast with the lord we want to know his will and we want to grow by his food and his power and his his word in our lives praise god and as again as 15 years of pastor god found that i need every sermon i need every service i need every worship service i can't skip any of them my spirit needs that my soul needs the word of god and i can't remember of course every single service over 15 years and now uh 21 years as being a christian but i know each and every one was especially important especially needful it's helped me to get to where i am today thank god and that's true for each one of us as we're on our journey uh serving the lord jesus christ we need each and every sermon each and every song service we need to meditate upon the lord uh just be fully devoted to the lord and love with him and let him be our portion let him be our satisfying portion how many would be satisfied with jesus amen that's that's really what it comes down to for the bible says if the love of the world's in you then the and the love of the father's not in you all right we must overcome the lust of the flesh lust of the eyes and the pride of life and by doing that we'll have we'll have christ be our satisfying portion in other words we'll be satisfied uh with every surface we'll be satisfied with worshiping and loving the lord that will be the highlight to our day highlight to our week it's just loving and serving god looking to the sky to see as jesus coming today praise god just having that type of expectation for the lord jesus christ so let's review you know we've gone now through 10 of the sons of israel and let's just briefly review them i'll try to be very brief so reuben was the eldest now of course he was disgraced demoted and replaced as we'll read a little bit of course he himself repented he had this awful sin simon preaching on this as i preached on it unstable as water sexual sin with his father's concubine there but we know later he was saved and he's given one of those 24 seats around the throne of christ as one of the heads of the 12 tribes of israel simeon and levi kind of goes together second and third simeon was disgraced into insignificance while levi was redeemed and exalted to the priesthood remember we kind of had two sets of brothers there that kind of worked together a lot issachar and zebulun and then um and then uh simeon levi okay and uh so this is what we see there thank god for the levitical priesthood you know and so forth uh ministering uh before the throne of god uh the ark of god fourth was judah judah was exalted to the lead not the birthright which that was a it was quite a good thought there brought up by brother simon he's exalted to the lead of the tribes but not given the birthright and of course he was exalted the lead because he was given david and then eventually christ because we know david was a pre-figure of jesus christ and then solomon a pre-figure of the son of david in the millennium and of course then we know solomon started the seven old testament church ages you know that's a beautiful message we looked at that recently fifth was dan dan was honored in samson but then disgrace in idolatry just to kind of summarize his his tribe and also before i move on remember like all these tribes got back together during the time of dave remember to make david king benjamin didn't have as much during that time because they were still kind of hanging on to clinging to saul but they still had some uh and and they came all these tribes get great came to a great unity and a great uh political and military power during the time of david and they all made david king praise god so we see again the unity of the body of christ for the rapture we know that's coming brother branham said it's in the name of the lord all the denominational barrels will be broken down barriers rather and the bride of jesus christ will be united before the rapture so we're looking forward to that and we're doing our part to make that happen now because we're uniting we only unite around the truth praise god and the love of god produces truth and we want to have the right spirit and the right doctrine just like the apostle paul had praise god six we have naftali i hope i'm saying that right uh he helped barrick and deborah but then remain insignificant until messiah and the apostles and but then it was very significant because jesus uh uh is his jesus uh is his his hometown for him for the majority of his ministry was in that area along with some of those other tribes but naphtali became extremely significant during the time of christ seventh was gad gad had overcoming warriors in david's time and they even produced elijah as god's mouthpiece for justice which fulfilled one of those prophecies as we saw a couple months back eighth was asher and asher for a time he was blessed in every single area of his life he had these beautiful children lots of children he had the most dainty food the best food uh the work and he had amazing strength okay and then kind of goes into some insignificance after those days but he was a great example the tribe was a great example of for a time able to possess every blessing god gave to them ninth was issachar issachar had an agricultural inheritance to work in and rejoice in and they possessed the plane of jezreel a pleasant land they had the wisdom to call israel to make david king in first corinthian or first chronicles 12 verse 32 it was they were the ones that had uh the wisdom they had some warriors but a lot of their men were known for their wisdom and their course it would have been their revelation because they the bible said they knew what to do in those times and they knew to make david king and so many other tribes all the other tribes followed these men of issachar because of their wisdom that god had foretold they were blessed naturally in their trade alongside zebulun who was positioned by the sea and then 10th zebulun zebuin was blessed naturally in trade alongside is a car and i'm sorry here we see these two brothers in harmony sorry i said the wrong one earlier no i think i said right it's a car in zebulun yeah sorry isa car in zebulun uh kind of like the other two but uh these these two were in harmony which is the opposite right of simeon levi because they when they got together it was destruction and trouble but when these two got together zebulon and nissikar it was harmony and blessing amen that's what we want all of our children to be praise god we want them all to be in harmony and blessing and where can be more than two maybe can be eight right or maybe it can be four or five or whatever three four whatever the lord would have you know that everybody would be in one accord and everybody could exist in harmony fulfilling god's perfect will for their lives and of course we also saw in zebulun the spiritual mountain that moses spoke of which likely referred to christ and his disciples because remember the bible said in matthew that christ would be there in naphtali and zebulun so their lands are really close there to capernaum where jesus spent the majority of his ministry and what a blessing for those tribes to have the messiah minister so often in their lands no doubt that was prophetic and fulfilled through jesus christ our lord what is what a tribute to those tribes okay so let's look at the i'm sorry the tribe of joseph pardon me uh so let's go look at our bibles here we read the birth scriptures in genesis 30 why don't we get uh malachi want to get genesis 49 22 okay should you want to get deuteronomy 33 13. joseph's name means he shall add i couldn't find brother random giving him a meaning of a name so i couldn't write anything there so let's uh let's let malachi read the prophecy of jacob about jacob's prophecy about his own son in genesis 49 verses 20 through 22-26 forgive me joseph is a fruitful bow even a fruitful bout by a well whose branch has run over the wall the archers have sorely grieved him and shot at him and hated him but his bow abide in strength and the arms of his hands were made drawn by the hands of the mighty god of jacob commences the shepherd the stone of israel even by the god of thy father who shall help thee and by the almighty who shall bless thee with the blessings of heaven above blessings from the deep that lie under blessings of the breasts and of the womb the blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills they shall be on the head of joseph and on the head of on the crown of the head of him that she was separate from his brother all right thank you now i looked at matthew henry what he said about this and obviously noted some very significant prophetic things joseph was going to be very large and full he was compared to a fruitful bow or a young tree and god had made him fruitful in the land of his affliction his two sons were as branches of a vine and other spreading plant running over the wall and we see how god makes those fruitful and great comforts to the themselves and others who've been looked upon as dry and withered and of course we saw that the beginning of the prophecy about how he'd be rejected of his brethren which we know he was and joseph was a almost a perfect type almost a perfect type of jesus christ right being spiritual having dreams being loved of the father rejected their brethren sown into a pit redeemed out of the pit and ultimately taken to be second in command right we know jesus on the right hand of the majesty on high there's many many beautiful types in the story of joseph but we see how it's prophetic foretold here by his father um we can see lots of results of course from this and i'm just kind of summarizing to make sure i can try to cover this kind of broadly here he received many blessings including a double portion and his two sons uh eat manas and even each became founder of a tribe of israel as well notice the best words went to joseph along with judah so just look at again look at judah and joseph and see how these men were so faithful that when god knows people are going to be faithful when god sees their heart they have served god with a perfect heart god is going to pour out his blessings on them okay now we know some of course will uh obey god but you know also go through great trials like stephen stone at such a young age what a what a wonderful servant of god obedient servant so we want to be careful when we talk about blessings you know because the blessing was for stephen to be a martyr and to have a martyr's crown and to see jesus you know uh after very short life have that time there in heaven so we gotta be careful we say the blessings but in this case you know these sons were given many natural blessings and of course spiritual blessings as well because their faithfulness joseph was faithful his entire life whereas we know judah grew into it he grew into this faithful walk so we see our case you know whether we if we look at our lives and we have failures we got to look past that and say god's given me a new day god's given me another chance he's a god of second chances third chances four's chances million chances and we've got to make the most of that and recognize that god sees our desire god will help us if we want to do right god will help us to do right and then we can expect the blessing of god to rest upon our lives we would just trust that our children born and raised in the message born and raised in a holy environment we just trust they'll be like joseph praise god that they'll have an experience with god at such a young age that the world will never be able to pull them away though satan will you know reach out and try to grab them each time they'll be able to pull back or maybe they can take the sword of the spirit you know and chop down the enemy by the grace of god that would be such a great testimony as we had a couple of preachers come in over the years and say that that jesus testimony was the greatest testimony that's true the greatest testimony is never forsaken the lord never leaving the church and going out and sewing wild notes like some people say in denomination you know uh or in the amish community or something like that the greatest testimonies being faithful overcoming satan and every one of his tricks and remaining faithful to the house lord so maybe we have some josephs and some josephines here spiritually speaking that each one will grow up and be such a testimony to jesus christ of the keeping power of the holy spirit praise god remember the bible said that remember the creator where in the days of your youth so only harder days are coming physically but also spiritually because we know the days get darker but of course the light of god in our lives shines brighter and brighter so those are great words to remember there um let's read that scripture i'm going to read that you stay there occasionally i'm going to read first chronicles 5. here's a just a beautiful thought this explains why joseph had so many promises malachi read malcolm i read all these promises all these natural blessings the hills the mountains and uh the womb you know he was gonna have so many blessings why because he was given the birthright because rue of what the evil sexual sin reuben committed so first chronicles 5 1 now the sons of reuben the firstborn of israel for he was the firstborn but for as much as he defiled his father's bed his birthright was given unto the sons of joseph the son of israel and the genealogy is not reckoned after the birthright for judah prevailed above his brethren and of him came the chief ruler but the birthright was joseph's so it's interesting these two men you know judah and joseph their tribes and their lives were so spectacular or so humble maybe before god maybe that's a better word humble god gave one the rulership judah david and solomon and christ and god gave the other the birthright and that's what god would do god will honor those who honor him and so just a beautiful fulfillment of those prophecies how judah is given the scepter the rulership right but then joseph has these wonderful blessed wombs uh hills food all these wonderful things given the birthright so he took it from leah right take it from leah's firstborn and give it to rachel's firstborn the wife he loved the woman he loved okay so there's that's great scripture that's all new understanding for me i can see how that's uh important to know can be applied to our lives as we we uh constantly possess more of our spiritual land as well that god will bless us and help us and guide us and direct our entire lives whether it be like joseph he was faithful even in prison if we'd be imprisoned or you know for a long time god would honor the faithfulness and and god would see our desire to love him serve him and trust god would give us a restoration like he did for joseph by the grace of the lord i thought i would just stop here and i had this thought as i was studying that i would um maybe interject to hear why joseph of the old testament types jesus christ i already went through some examples but i just want to say again why he doesn't type brother branham's son joseph branham our precious brother in the lord who i respect and have emailed and been in contact with numerous times um but the air is that in uh his letter from 2001 here i stand um he typed himself as joseph of the old testament storing up the food but brother branham never used his type okay the type the wrong it's a wrong type because uh types the bride is either egypt right right or joseph's brothers rather than joseph's gentile wife as an f so the error here is from this letter here i stand was adding to the word or message of course the message only points to the word and misinterpreting the word so what is that 20 years ago now 20 years ago now we can all look and say okay this is still wrong and hopefully everyone's eyes are or more people's eyes are being open to this 20 years ago wow they misinterpreted the word look where they're at now at least 11 false doctrines exalting the tapes almost worshiping the tapes pretending brother ram is alive and he's still their pastor and he can still marry them just a lot of erroneous doctrines we can see the results of those seeds those were seeds planted in 2001 this brother and the ministry exalting themselves above the other and look at the results all these years later god be merciful so the quote says you you might be eating stolen bread my friend this is from here i stand in 2001. but it's not because there's a famine among the bride or because i have scheme to keep food from your table as some would have you to believe the food has been stored up why should the bride be starving the granaries are stocked food is available in 45 languages end quote so in genesis 41 it said the famine was over all the face of the earth and joseph opened all the storehouses and sold unto the egyptians and the famine wax soar in the land of egypt and all the countries came into egypt to joseph for to buy corn because that the famine was so sore in all the lands so the real type is joseph's wife azaneth typing the gentile bride and joseph typing jesus christ because jesus christ is the one who has all the stored up food right he's got it all stored up and even if you look at the type there were storehouses in every every city location well that's not how it is jeffersonville thinks they're the only storehouse that doesn't fit the type right so the type would be there's a storehouse or there's a local church all over right there's many places to be fed praise god uh but the one who controls it all and feeds all is jesus christ amen because he's in control of all of it he knows he knows all where it's all at he's the one who organized it planned it out that's jesus christ took care of that so egypt is correctly typed to the world running to and fro around the world searching for food fulfilling the prophecy of amos 8 verses 11 and 12. joseph's brethren are correctly typed as the 144 000. so amos 8 says there's a famine not a bread but the hearing of the words of the lord and isn't that prophetic also about how the the truth would be lost through the church ages if the truth wasn't lost then you could find bread in every church right no matter what denomination but if the truth was lost and there was only a small group who would have it restored to them then this would make sense there's a famine for the hearing of the words of god so churches will travel over planes conferences all over the world of course it stopped during 2020 but starting to pick back up again thinking they're traveling there to get the food but they're missing the revelation on marriage and divorce they don't have the revelation they marry they're adulterers right they don't have the revelation on holiness they're paying to face jezebels and i don't say that arrogantly but that's that's what many of them are they control their husbands right they're dominating females cutting their hair dishonoring their husband as the sisters and men that cuss and smoking are adulterers in their hearts right unholy unthankful unnatural you know addicted to all kinds of things you know pornography and food like we said on sunday food idleness addicted to idleness and laziness because of all the excessive natural food and not working for the lord like they ought to many of these preachers have fallen over the last few years the big name preachers into money money laundering and uh adulteries all kinds of wickedness you know and by their fruits they're known but we want to be not a corrupt tree but we want to be a a good tree that produces good fruit and we can by staying attached to the vine we are the branches christ is the vine praise god amen so that fulfills uh amos 8 and makes this make sense no wonder there's a famine for the hearing of the word no wonder because the truth has been lost down to the church ages and it's only restored in a small group jesus said fear not my little flock it's your father's good will to give you the kingdom okay so brother repeatedly said uh joseph types christ here it is in the church age book let's examine the life of joseph while he was in egypt for it is here we see him as the perfect type of christ he never said my son right brother never said that but brother man did say i pray that billy paul would fully be a prophet of god was he no brother ram did say rebecca will take my place did she no okay brother brown did say billy paul's my promise joseph was he no so those are fathers hopes those are you know loving dads would want that i mean what dad doesn't want his son and daughters to grow up and be spiritual and leaders and anointed with all kinds of gifts of the holy spirit i want that for all my children and i hope that is and i pray to that but just because i believe something if god doesn't show me that doesn't mean it's going to happen and then in a prisoner 1963 july 17th brother branham said i see one before me now his name is joseph he was an elected son he was a perfect type of jesus christ he was born a prophet he was a prophet also saw visions and so forth brothers bowing to him you can read that quote if you like now here's what i want to say too brother ma'am recognize that these spirits that got on people to make his every word infallible they cannot be reasoned with and yet they say they believe every word of brother branham this is from 1961 revelation chapter 5 part 2. he said how could they do it he said 15 or 20 people thinking i was jesus christ i was right on to them until i found out that god told me it was a spirit and the them said men said and the men believe me every word i know that just sound like this movement out of jeffersonville i said how do you believe me then if i tell you then we got to the word then they begin to see well we sure we didn't believe you or we would have listened what you'd said see here but they actually thought they were right sincerely see and one of them spirits gets on you that's got it see you'll absolutely believe it i don't care you nobody can tell you any different see no matter how much the word says so well you just believe it anyhow just go on remember leadership from jeffersonville has said that they don't care brother ma'am lied on the tape they said they're still going to believe it [Music] so that's to me that's revealing the spirit that they're under yeah well see we need to be under the real joseph the lord jesus christ amen amen because he's the type for this day it fits perfectly how he's feeding us all thank god we're the wife and jesus wife joseph's wife never was starving and we're never starving we always got a good solid meal the word of god thank god for his grace and mercy we're feasting on the message of the hour praise god stored up food all right let's move on to benjamin here let me check my time okay now of course much more could be said about joseph but i'll stop there because i want to get this thought here finished because you can see of course how the prophecies were about joseph and even him and his his overcoming of his brethren and so forth and loving them forgiving them and then all the blessings that remain on he and his offspring in the promised land getting the birthright the best of the land all those great all the blessings of the womb you know all the great blessings that god gives to his children joseph's family received okay so benjamin now benjamin was a tribe here it's a little bit south of uh of ephraim and dan and gad a little bit it's kind of close to judah so north of judah uh so let's look at uh some scriptures on benjamin here i'm sorry we never read questions you never read did you i'm sorry yeah let me get back i never i guess i never read those scriptures do you want to read on you or do you want me to read it okay yeah i'm sorry let's go back we i missed those uh joe subscription let me read those um deuteronomy 33 and then 13-17 and if joseph he said blessed of the lord be his land and the precious things of heaven for the dew and for the deep that couches beneath and for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun and for the precious things brought forth by the men and for the chief things of the ancient mountains and for the precious things of the lasting hills and for the precious things of the earth and the fullness thereof and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush let the blessing come upon the head of joseph and that upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren his glory like is the first swing of the bullet and his horns are like the horns of the unicorns and with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth and they are the ten thousand of ephraim and the and they are the thousands of manasseh thank you hon so we can again see more about prophecy regarding joseph and then his sons ephraim and manasseh notice how his glory is like to the first sling of the bullock there's the first sling firstborn you can see how that prophecy was in there and later played out beautiful thank you keisha thanks malachi for reading i appreciate that okay so now let's go back to benjamin there his name means the son of my right hand i'm gonna start with deuteronomy 33 12. this is of course moses and a benjamin he said the beloved lord shall dwell in safety by him and the lord shall cover him all the day long and he shall dwell between his shoulders what a blessing that god would cover you all the day long i had a brother from india emailed me this week and he said brother should we pray the blood of jesus over our lives every day or is it just one sufficient i said well it seemed like you'd want to do it every day because people can reject the blood and the scripture was hebrews 10 29 people that were once sanctified by the blood can then turn around and trample underfoot the son of god afresh and then also the lord's prayer lead us not into temptation but delivers from evil it's a daily prayer so in other words you're asking for the leadership of the holy spirit and then the bible says the blood of christ the everlasting covenant in hebrews 13 19 and 20 will make you perfect unto every good work what does the blood the blood makes you perfect for every work in other words the life of god and the forgiveness of jesus blood will make you perfect to do every good work your schoolwork all right your uh your ministry your music ministry you know uh anything at all you know your future ministry you know your future job uh your singing ministry you know you think of everything god's given to you the blood of christ makes you perfect in those ministries just constantly confessing obeying the holy spirit staying true to god that god's gonna bless you in all those ministries okay now the uh uh commentator adam clark said this is prophetic of jerusalem because jerusalem was within the coast of benjamin where the temple of god would be built and that's where they get he'll dwell among the shoulders so the two mountains is what adam clark said which would be pretty powerful mariah and zion be pretty powerful and i'm gonna dwell there i'm gonna cover them all day long we sang about that right it's the joy of the whole earth is mount zion the city of the great king so just a beautiful there seemed to be a beautiful prophecy of of course solomon building the temple there david had the tabernacle but solomon built the temple and then of course the future coming of the millennial temple of jesus christ to rest right there of course the earth will raise up the bible said i believe in isaiah chapter two a mountain will raise up and then a mountain will sit upon a mountain praise god beautiful beautiful prophecy of our lord now i'm going to go to genesis 49 27 for the other one 49-27 so benjamin again is a very uh very short prophecy only two verses and benjamin shall raven as a wolf he'll be a ravenous wolf in the morning he shall devour the prey and at night he shall divide the spoil or the plunder the hebrew says okay so albert barnes looked at this and the pro the prophecy was fulfilled because benjamin was a very warlike tribe by both character and conduct now conduct is a good one character is not you don't want a warring character but that's kind of what they got wasn't saul trying to kill david i think he's using all his warring powers and abilities to try to kill his own son-in-law who've done nothing wrong so we have that idea of a war-like character but also conduct and this tribe produced some warriors like e-hood remember ehood was a left-handed man the second deliverer or judge of israel he's the one that snuck in there to egg line and deceived him and he stuck that knife through right with the left hand and he was a great mighty deliverer he was from the tribe of benjamin then you have saul and jonathan i remember david looked at after he died so these men were stronger than lions they were swifter than eagles they were some really great warriors unfortunately though saul had an evil spirit on him the majority of his adulthood and kingship which caused great disgrace upon him but again we see this idea of a ravening wolf right a ferocious uh predator warrior we see that being played out in some of their descendants okay now another prominent individual was the apostle paul came in the tribe of benjamin right so that was important benjaminites had some also prominent left-handed men as we talked about e-hood benjamin was also the center of a civil war that devastated them so that's where they get that wolf in character a civil war nearly destroyed them remember because they wouldn't give up those sons of belle isle that did the awful things to the concubine levites concubine if i'm not mistaken it's in genesis chapters 19 through 21 and they were almost totally wiped out um benjamin also included some famous cities like bethel but eventually idols were set up there for israel to worship and but then also of course contain jerusalem which many times was a great center of worship so we see that benjamin had a a strong start but then became cruel and we see that played out through the different histories okay looks like we got most of that oh yeah one more thing too this is beautiful benjamin was famous for their archers so let's go to first chronicles uh 8 40. i'll read that so again like the wolves right the warrior the predator type of people first chronicles 840. and the sons of ulam were mighty men of valor archers and had many sons and son sons and 150 all these were the sons of benjamin chapter 12 verse 2. they were armed with bows and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow even of saul's brethren a benjamin think about that both i think it's called ambidextrous right where you can use both right hand just as good as your left hand with the stones and the bow they were like the scripture said they were going to be ravenous wolves they were going to hunt they were going to be warriors and then divide the spoil just according to the scripture okay so we can see the prophecy here all fulfilled and then also a beautiful type of jerusalem uh being the place where god would dwell a beautiful type there so we see with many of the sons you know some had some had all good things said about him but then others had some negative but then would be redeemed and have some positive uh you know prophecies as well so we thank god doesn't that speak to us about amazing grace there's going to be some christians that really live the high calling right they're going to be exalted like joseph judah type of christians but there's going to be other ones that maybe have difficult starts but god's going to be able to redeem their lives and make something beautiful out of their lives praise god and so we're just thankful for that and we want to be the faithful ones we want to be ones that always stay true to god able to overcome trials and temptations and the bible says give all diligence to make your calling elections sure so we want to be the ones that are diligently serving god there's no question where we stand right people look at our lives and they see all these people are abiding in the vine they're abiding in christ jesus may god give us that type of testimony all the days of our life that we can accomplish god's will for our life because that's really at the heart of it it's not for self-exaltation or self-reward it's uh pleasing the heart of god right jesus said i always do that which pleases the father and that's what our desire should be to to please our heavenly father as well now in closing i'm just going to briefly say a few words about joshua 20. so i'm going to close with that so now i'm done with those 12 tribes by god's grace we finished those 12 tribes and seen all their prophecies or many of their prophecies throughout the scripture there and how although we can't maybe understand them ourselves we know god fulfilled all of them and we can we can see with our own eyes and our spiritual mind in the scriptures in history we can see how most of them were fulfilled and again 400 years or 100 years before they happened it doesn't matter to god because god sees the beginning from the end the spirit of jesus christ is the spirit of prophecy so that encourages us everything god foresaw about our lives will come to pass god knew he wanted us living in 2012 so we could be a light and witnesses and we can be standards we the bible said we can be examples to the people uh and we would be a city on a hill that could not be hit and we'd be a bride who made herself ready praise god we were chosen for that we've got to walk in that and fulfill that scripture just like jesus fulfilled the scripture for his day praise god okay so let's close with joshua 20 1-6 i'm gonna do it on time okay the lord also spake unto joshua saying speak to the children of israel saying a point out of i'll say out for you cities of refuge wherefore i spake unto you by the hand of moses that the slayer that killed any person unawares and unwittingly may flee thither and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood and when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city and shall declare his cause and the ears of the elders of the city they shall take him into the city unto them and give him a place that he may dwell among them if the avenger of blood pursue after him then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand because he smote his neighbor unwittingly and hated him not a four time or unintentionally and he shall dwell in that city until he stand before the congregation for judgment and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days then shall the slayer return and come unto his own city under his own house under the city from whence he fled of course the rest of the chapter verses 7 and 9 is about this as well i just i was thinking about this and i remembered a quote from brother branham so i just want to close this quote from brother brown just a beautiful thought he says now if you want to do right he said i'm so glad tonight to tell you that there is a city of refuge he said that's jesus christ if you don't want to do wrong the enemy's after you then there is a way of escape how many feel like the enemy sometimes after that you're trying to do right right and this in this case it was unintentional you did you didn't mean to do anything wrong sometimes the devil seems like he's after you and brother ram said then there's a way of escape and that escape is jesus christ there's a place where you can come and let off the steam amen but if you're loved to sin and you don't want god then the enemy is going to overtake you somewhere you have you can't come to christ because you don't want to and when this man comes to christ this place of refuge when a man come in the old testament the first thing he had to come upon his own free will so they couldn't force him had to be his own desire i want to be free i want to be safe i want to stop running from the devil right i want a place where i can rest that's the only that's the way you have to come to christ you've got to want it yourself you have to be tired of running from your past right tired of running from your previous mistakes what a beautiful thought that is praise god at church we shouldn't run from him you know we should go confess our sins right that's really the city of refuge right we confess our sins confess our faults one to another and the bible says pray for those that are sick and god will heal them praise god james chapter 5 we confess our faults one to another not running from our problems but dealing with our problems and being a respectful honest sincere christian i'm going to continue the quote another thing you must be satisfied while you're there you can't hang around every day crying i'd like to get out of here i like to get out of here they put you out brother says you must willingly want to stay it must be that you must want to stay in that city and when you come to christ you can't look back to the world the bible said he that puts his hand on the plow and turns the look back is not worthy of plowing like we think of mrs lot right lot's wife looking back now there's where there's where so many so-called christians make their mistakes see they act like they're going to plow but the first little thing comes along they blow up about it okay and they lose their place of safety so i'm closing with that may god help us uh to remember that if we want to do right there's a place of safety for us where we don't have to run from our our past run from our problems that's in jesus christ and we can stay there as long as we want to praise god it's a free gift we can have that gift as long as we want it and my prayer is that we'll have it so long it'll be sealed into us praise god and then we'll never leave praise god because we're sealed not to the next high priest lives or dies you know we're sealed to the day of our redemption in christ jesus all right america can come we'll close the few songs here in a word of prayer no question okay so praise the lord trust that was a blessing it was great to you know bring the completion of these 12 sons lord willing unless something else would become inspired and also to see how joshua had established these cities i say like this cities of christ these cities of grace these cities of jesus christ where you can rest from running from the past you can have beast you can have forgiveness so you can stay there as long as you want to stay there god gives us the desire of our hearts thank god for that praise god let's have a word of prayers we bow our heads heavenly father we thank you for this time tonight lord a little different setting of course but nevertheless we're in your presence that's the same setting dear god we thank you for the blood of jesus christ lord thank you god for washing us in your blood dear god [Music] we thank you for the word and the

women come in dear god i pray for my children all the young children in our church god that they would be faithful from a young age just like a joseph lord god diligent may they experience such a blessing faith oh god they never had to go out to the world they have power to overcome those temptations in jesus christ's name granted god have that greater testimony by the power of god [Music] as the lord we just worship you tonight god we ask again lord if anyone's tired of running from the past may they run to jesus christ many of us are tired of running from the enemy feeling like he's got
