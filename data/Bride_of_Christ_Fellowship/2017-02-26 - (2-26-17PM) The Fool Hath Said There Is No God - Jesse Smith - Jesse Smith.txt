by God's grace brother Kevin gave me a few requests uh he asked for prayer for a family they were going to a funeral tonight um a family had a young boy I think he was in the military children is that right do you remember and he got accidentally killed so they're praying for a a family that lost a young man so we pray for that family also he asked prayer um he asked for God would lead him to a job in Pennsylvania I guess it's right across the border or something like that you think that'd be a better job for him also I have um a Bible study Tuesday with that family and cople I just like ask you to keep that in prayer and the wife still wants to be baptized the husband's praying about it they're kind of waiting for warm weather and then like I said a little child one of the boys came up to me a fourth grader said his mom said his God's really to deal with him and he said he chose me to baptize him so I said okay you know a fourth grader was want to be baptized so I said we got to sit down and do a bible study on baptism so and then another gentleman like I told you this morning another gentleman he's in his 40s I think and he wants to be baptized too so there's three people that possibly would want to be baptized trusting that they'll go beyond baptism into sanctification amen and the Holy Ghost so numerous things to pray about are there anything else that uh we want pray for tonight anything else sister amen praise God let's pray for our sister hallelujah praise God anything else okay praise the Lord amen God is good let's take these knees before the Lord here let's just bow our heads and ask God to minister to each one of these Heavenly Father Lord God we come through the channel of prayer Lord we saw this morning Lord that prayer is such a help Lord to others when we enter into their sufferings as your Prophet said we need to feel it what the person's feeling when we pray for them so Lord tonight as we pray as I pray may we lord have the burden of the person behind the request Lord God we ask that Jesus we come through that blood Lord as we think about that song Through the blood we come in your presence it's through your sacrifice your goodness your Works your Deeds that we come tonight reverently forgive us of our sins Lord and I pray Lord hear our prayers dear Lord first I pray for the family that Kevin knows having a funeral for uh a son who died Lord accidentally father May the holy spirit guide them to be a light and a help and a witness dear God may he bring Comfort Lord through them Kevin and Marie to that family Lord Jesus be with them Lord he ask for prayer for a job Lord he's already got a job but he he would like this job just in the Pennsylvania border Lord I just pray you'd give him Grace to receive that job if it Be Your Will Lord God you know what he has need of Lord and I pray you'd help him dear God to find the right position he needs to be in with our sister Karen's unspoken request God Of Heaven God of Mercy the father of mercies I pray your hand of Mercy would reach down to our sister's request meet that need Lord God we know if we pray all things are possible we must only believe so we believe tonight knowing you can give our sister a touch Lord God answer to this request we ask that in Jesus name Lord and I pray for this bible study on Tuesday lord it's on repentance may you bring this family to True repentance dear God as I've I've cried this alar I plead this Altar for that family Lord I'm just trusting and believing you're going do something in that family Lord and draw them to this message Lord I pray may you bless that Bible study and may that husband want to be baptized too I pray the weather would warm Lord in your time and we could baptize all three individuals the the wife and then the husband and perhaps a fourth individual the husband would be the fourth but that young man I think his name is Wayne Lord that Wayne would be baptized soon and then the little boy Andrew Lord Jesus May these Hearts open to water baptism justification and to sanctification in the baptism of the Holy Ghost through the message of the hour this message you sent through your Prophet

the way we can come into His presence through the blood through the BL the Holy Blood through the blood we can into his presence thank you for forgiveness thank you for Mercy Jesus Jesus Christ has been made the way we can come into His presence through the blood amen thank you brother praise God let's go to Psalms chapter 14 verse one like I said this morning I like to preach on the fool has said there is no God I want to look at these proofs of God uh that are in science and brother brandom's proofs from his stories and from scripture as well by God's grace it seems like all my Christian life I've just one always been wanted to answer somebody this is proof that God exists you know so this sermon has been on my heart a long time long time and I think I can get it's probably two parts I probably won't be able to finish tonight I'm going to check the the timer set the timer rather to make sure I don't strain my voice and things like that uh Psalms 14:1 appreciate everybody coming out to the house of the Lord tonight that could make it by God's grace brother Ram was here I'd be in church tonight wouldn't you I always use that as my leadership and guiding you know if brother r was here how would I act that's how I'd act I'd go to church with him praise God but he's not here in the flesh but the holy spirit is here amen so Psalms 14 verse1 to the chief musician a Psalm of David the fool has said in his heart there is no God they are corrupt they have done abominal works there is none that doeth good the Lord lookth down from heaven upon the children of men to seek if there were any that did understand and seek God and we'll close with verse or finish with verse three they are all gone aside they are all together become filthy there's none that doeth good know not one amen let's have a word of prayer let's just bow our heads one more time Father in heaven we thank you for this word Lord God we know you're real lord even demons know you're real Lord God and we're thankful that you're real thank you that you've made yourself real to us you haven't blinded us like you blinded Israel Lord God but the Gentiles now can have eyes that are illuminated the Bible says oh Lord thank thank you for the ice Sal of the holy spirit that we can see that you're alive today you're interested in our lives and Lord You've committed Our Lives to your word we've committed ourselves to you Lord and we thank you God for your purpose in our lives take this night and just bless this message to the hearts of the people it's been such a blessing to meet Lord and I just pray it we just sit in Heavenly places here tonight enjoying your word in Jesus Christ's name and everybody said amen God bless you uh so let's look at this thought tonight the full said it there is no God so I have about like I said I found a I've just been listening you know over and over as I listen to these sermons where the ram tells stories about meeting infidels and things like that and you probably heard them how many have the supernatural books does everybody have the supernatural books that Owen Jenson okay we've loved those and we've listened to those quite a bit maai can you switch over and a couple of these came from remembrance so I'm going to read through those and uh I know they'll be a blessing to you I want to go through some scriptures first by the grace of the Lord and uh we'll start there in Psalms 14 it's a real good uh real good thought by the grace of the Lord so the fool said there is no God now the Bible said the fool said in his heart there is no God now the word fool means senseless and that's kind of as you get in the the science realm of things uh when the atheist says there is no God they're literally denying what the senses tell them and that makes them an Absol absolute fool because they're denying their senses they're denying data they're denying observations they're denying the reality they God gave us so that's really uh why God calls him a fool because they don't they refuse to use the five senses that they so claim to use right scientists claim to use all the five senses the scientific method and yet they deny it when it points to a Creator so uh that's why God calls them fools so we can I've I've sat with Austin and I've looked across theable table at our friend Bell and I've said you know not to offend you but the Bible calls you a fool for being an atheist remember when I told him that the first time we met him and he didn't I said I'm not defend you but that's just what the Bible says um so we have to say what the Bible says and God's word is true God always back up his word his word will never fail so we're thankful that we get to use our senses and find God now that's the scripture we had earlier now here's the one I mentioned in prayer thou believest there is one God thou doest well the demons also believe and tremble so it's got to be more than just an intellectual belief it's got to be a revelation and that's why we know a lot of churches today that preach water down Doctrine they say they believe in God but do they even tremble at the word no the word says don't commit adultery they don't tremble at that the word says a woman should have long hair they don't tremble at that they don't tremble at the word but yet they say they believe so it's an intellectual belief it's not a revelation hasn't gone down to the heart yet now I just want to show how the real science that God approves of uses the senses because remember a fool he's senseless he don't use any of his senses he denies his senses so God certainly approves of science that's real science uh Mariam Webster says science is the knowledge or system of knowledge covering General truths or the operation of general laws especially has obtained and tested through scientific methods so I teach first grade so basically what they say they kind of they kind of break this down just to the scientific method they say teach the children in science basically teach them the scientific method and the scientific method of course is uh principles or procedures for the systematic pursuit of knowledge and it involves I'm just going to skip to the yell involves the collection of data through observation and experiment and the formulation and testing of hypotheses so you have to you have to in order to be real science you got to be able to test it over and over and it's got to be repeated and it's got to be observed through the senses right but atheist says denies all the senses they deny everything they see and read and uh so that makes them a fool they're senseless okay now God of course loves science God bless Daniel haniah Michel and Azariah you know God blessed them the Bible said they were under they were those that understood science so God's not against science as long as it's real science praise God uh false science does not use the senses as we said and Tim Paul wrote to Timothy about this Paul was the prophet Paul was not against science either the Bible said oh Timothy keep that which is committed to thy trust avoid profane and Vain babblings and oppositions of science falsely so-called so he knew there would be people that would have science and would come against real science but uh science but they're falsely called science they're not really science so they are false science which some professing have ear concerning the faith Grace be with thee amen so see that's obviously scripture brother Bram talked about science all the time all the books and Popular Mechanics I don't have many quotes on that but I know I've heard him say that now I want to just switch over to some Bible Club slides these are the slides I used last year when I taught on proof of Creator at bible Club here and I'm going to skip ahead to the ones we started at so here's what I was teaching at the Bible club with the kids in other words stay away from false science teachings that are not facts things that cannot you cannot observe and see so if you can't observe it or see it it's a lie right it's that's not real science for example I told the kids Evolution uh they say man came from an ape well that's false we know that's false uh because that's not true science who is there to observe that nobody can we do experiments today to prove monkeys turn into men can we do that is there any data or any tests or what we can do over and over again and get th that fact of course not so this is not true science no because the Bible said the Lord God formed man now I was with the kids and I said' now to be fair you know none of us were able to observe god making man like none of us were there right uh and we cannot do experiments that prove God created man like I can't do an experiment and show you like God created Adam I can't do that today uh but all the scientiic facts we observe and all the experiments we do lead to us lead us to know that all the energy and life in the universe came from somewhere or someone because and I'm not I'm I'm not ready to preach this uh today but if you uh start studying a little bit on science and the be the the the beginning of the universe you'll find that scientists now believe the universe had a beginning and the universe is filled with energy and so they know there had to be something even more powerful than all the energy in the universe to create all that energy in the universe so there had to be something more powerful to create all the power and energy in the universe and so atheist say well that's that's the nothing that's actually something because they said everything came from nothing so they say all where wherever that all this energy came from in this system that we call the universe wherever this came from that's the nothing that uh everything came from so they said so the chrisan say so you're saying the nothing is a something and they say yes so see it's senseless there there's no sense to that for something to create something it's got to be something right right so I'm just going to lay this down here just briefly I just want to go through that so see everything we look to and this what the Bible actually says is God makes himself known to all men the Bible says that but the Bible said God gives knowledge to every man that he's alive and he's he is the real power of the universe which we'll get to that Romans 1 in a little bit so why is evolution false this is good for Lydia and Sarah and all the Malachi and the little ones well the first reason it's false there's no known observable process by which new genetic information can be added to the genetic code of any living thing nothing can new nothing new can be added uh but there's a lot of genetics that that can have uh that can uh Express themselves what's in what's called adaptation with you know Darwin's finches and everything like that their beaks would change and I'm not ready to preach on that yet but I've been reading about that that genetic code to change a beak is already in the finch it's already there nothing's being added to it uh there's no nothing's evolving it's just addap ation inside the the the creature itself that God created so again so a ape cannot gradually change into a man because it cannot add to the genetic information inside of itself it can never add to it whatever it's got at the beginning that's what it's got and Sciences prove that even a little baby in the womb of her mother a little baby girl has all of the egg she'll ever have already in the womb before she's even born so it's see it's already set it's already finished you cannot add to that God and God said it's finished right all the creation was already finished so it works out perfectly amen so the genetic information inside of being is all it will ever have you cannot add the genetic information to change it so here's another thing uh there are no known examples or observable examples of evolution right now for example can anyone show me a cat that is almost evolved into a lion or how about a monkey that's almost involved into a man there's no because God said it's finished nothing's changing nothing's turning into something else it's already finished because God put a stamp of approval upon it and said it's good amen it's good it's already good it's already finished number two why is evolution false there's no known observable process by which life came from non-life Life only comes from Life okay so that's another thing atheists say well life came from non-life that's impossible life only comes from Life Energy only comes from more energy right you have to have a source of energy before you can have energy so false science says life came out of non-life so this is a you know of course a timeline you know from a we'd say from a atheist or something like that some say the cells formed four billion years ago by chance so these are billions and billions here it says billions of years old they just you know they they're just making guesses but again who observed any of that did anybody observe any of that can we test that today no then you're not following the scientific method then it's not science it's religion so an atheist is living by false religion of course right now just a few more here and then we'll get back to the the sermons and stories so number two life only comes from Life the law of reproduction that's what God said in Genesis 1 11 and 12 God said let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding sealed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so praise God so God designed it life only comes from life so where did you get your life from God Almighty your spiritual life I'm not and your natural life but your spiritual life as well that had to come from a seed it had to come from God it come from God's eternal spirit amen now I moved on there uh I'm gon to skip ahead a little bit I found some archaeology remember last year they found hezekiah's seal they saw they found the Seal of the king there in Israel last year that was pretty wonderful CNN reported on that um and some of the wisest and most respected scientists of all time believed in God did you know that only a fool would not believe in God right that's what God Said now all these I looked up this is a infographic you know that I found online but I went and looked up all these guys in uh the online dictionary and there're it's all true like everything on this infograph is true so you can't trust every infograph but you got to go back and study it out so Galileo let's look at Galileo and then we'll look at well I don't think I got to Johannes ke I don't think but I know I got to Newton I'm pretty sure I got to Newton yes here's Galileo he lived from 1564 to 1642 he made legendary discoveries in the study of motion observables observational science astronomy through the use of the telescope and how the Sun is the center of the solar system and let's see what did he say I'm going to go back to that what did he say pardon me he said uh mathematics is the alphabet with which God has written the universe amen remember brother ra said God is in the numerology I like to preach a sermon on that too I've started a file where I've listed all the numbers and when I when I find numbers in the Bible I try to plug them in there and one day I like to preach a full message on that Lord willing Isaac Newton said yeah I didn't get to Johannes but I get to Isaac Newton I found him gravity explains the Motions of the planets but it cannot explain who set the planets in motion I like that God governs all things and knows all that is or can be done Newton actually was a real he was like a kind like a part-time Theologian I don't know if you knew that but that's in the history too so let's look at that let me go past him again I'll kind of skip ahead okay Aristotle yeah he wasn't on my infog graphic was he okay he lived from 384 to 322 boy short life uh legendary scientist and philosopher who believed in God most universities still study as teaching I did when I was in school at acru he wrote that the best form of philosophy is thinking about the universe and nature this was the reason God gave man Godlike intelligence was to have wisdom or philosophy God wanted you to think about God wanted you to think about uh all these things and have the wisdom in the of the universe and to be able to you know live the right kind of life now Isaac Newton he was a he was a lightweight Theologian by God's grace 1642 to 1727 legendary physicist and mathematician who started the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century he made amazing discoveries in Optics which is a study of light mechanics motion physics which is the law of gravitation and calculus uh and then this yeah this is this is actually on the britanica he spent years of his life studying the godhead did you know that I didn't know that father son Holy Ghost and the Prophecies of Daniel and St John The Book of Revelation he has all kinds of letters and pamphlets that he wrote trying to study prophecy and understand the Bible don't you love that one of the smartest most scientific men the history's ever known they still read him today in the universities and he was a believer in the Bible amen just thought I'd uh encourage you with that here's a new man you never might never seen before I found him while I was studying some YouTube videos and I thought well let me see if that's legit let me go look him up but it actually was his name is Anthony flu now he passed away in 2010 he's a famous former atheist philosopher and I guess he was really staunch atheist for many years who fought the belief in God for most of his life six years before his death his heart changed and he publicly stated he believed in God due to the complexity of human DNA he actually wrote it in his book in 2006 he joined other scientists who urg British Prime Minister Tony Blair to introduce intelligent design to Britain's Public Schools I thought that was pretty powerful so DNA Le has has led a couple scientists to be Believers in God I've read about that and I got a few of them out we have to research later I have to research more and show you later but these are the ones I got a chance to research last year do you like that by God's grace isn't it is encouraging to see that some of the smartest scientific men ever all believed in God they weren't fools they believed their senses and they realize all this information all this creation points to God Amen okay so I'm gonna stop right there because I had now I showed the kids a video I got a video here of LeBron James they asked LeBron James last year and the kids were laughing they asked him said hey when when uh I forget which player on the team when he gets back from his injuries is everything going to be all right and he said uh he said no he said you can he said there's only one person you can Bank on he said that's Jesus Christ now I know he don't live a good life because he cusses and all kinds of things like that but even someone as F I was telling the kids even if someone as famous as him is not a fool he knows there's a God and listen he's got to answer to God we've all got to answer to God so I just thought that would be an encouragement to the kids there they really like that but uh remember all these wise men these smart men they all believed in God okay now let me get back to here now I think I'll kind of go through this kind of quickly because I uh uh last year I preached on the lean Church age and one of the sermons I talked about blindness you might remember it let me make that larger and I spent a little bit of time in Romans 1 and two uh proving that God can judge everybody because they're all they're all accountable to God's creation for the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness because that which may be known of God now listen is appearing or manifesting in them for God has showed it unto them so God I'll just here's what's my notes God has shown the knowledge of himself to each man and this knowledge appears and is recognized in them so every person can look at their body and say there must be a God God there's some knowledge of God somewhere right that's what the Bible says God has shown this to every man and it's in you it's in them and that's what the scientists can't explain they asked Bill NY the Science Guy they asked him had a debate with Ken Ham a couple years ago they said they said okay you try to explain where uh matter comes from where does uh where does the Mind where does the mental state come from he's like we don't know that science can't explain that because they said uh that the spiritual can't come from the physical in other words uh that did not evolve the the the mental state of man could not evolve so they have no answers for that but what is God showing God's showing them this that he has made it plain to everybody that there is a God somewhere because they can look at their own bodies their own minds they can't explain how this all happened so God proves it to everybody that he's real amen that's his knowledge Hallelujah now verse 20 lays it out a little bit clear for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen my being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse there'll be nobody here within any excuse right I'm not without excuse every man has no excuse because God has shown invisible things through the things that are seen all creation Now I'm going to skip ahead here so verse 20 it said the eternal power and godhead are clearly seen as they are understood by creation or nature the presence of nature or creation leaves all men without excuse on the day of judgment that's right now see the Bible said now two verses later the Bible said they professed themselves to be wise they became what fools oh we're so smart we there is no Creator and the Bible literally instantly called them fools because you're denying your senses you're denying the creation and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge see they didn't want they didn't want God's word in their minds because they knew they were guilty of breaking the commands of God God gave them over to reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient now here's the one that I really liked uh Romans 2 it's 1 through 16 but for time sake I'm just going to read a few of these here for there is no respect of persons with God for as many have sinned without the law shall also perish without the law and as many have have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law so see if people didn't have the law of Moses they would still perish without the law for not the hearers of the law are just before God but the doers of the law shall be justified for when the Gentiles which have not the law do by Nature the things contain the law these having not the law are law unto themselves now that's where we get this thought where you can go to Every culture and you find murders wrong you go to Every culture lying stealing is wrong why because God wrote the law in their conscience amen right so see even if you don't know the law of Moses even if you don't know the law of God you have a something inside of you telling you there needs to be laws because you can observe all the laws of nature right and also the laws of the spiritual realm which show the work of the law written in their hearts see the the law of God is written in their hearts they know better their conscience also Bears witness and the their thoughts the mean while excusing or else excusing one another I'm sorry accusing or else excusing in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel so do you remember that when I preached on that does anybody remember that from last year I don't know if you did or not but see the the law is already in their hearts people will have no excuse before God because God put the law right in there and he showed them through nature uh all his power and godhead are seen clearly by what we see out in nature praise God let's go through a through few stories about the prophet of God proving God would you like that would you like to hear that oh I think they're really I think you'll really enjoy these you probably heard them before I'm not sure Austin has uh I don't know yeah I'm not sure my children I think we might have heard them uh I know I have of course but okay here's the one about the Kentucky Infidel in nature remember this one he went with Mr wood with banks wood he went to this this man in Kentucky he says Mr wood and I are coming home we drove down the mountains in Kentucky little country where I had been at the Methodist campgrounds down there a place called active just one grocery store filling station and Campground and it's called Acton Kentucky the little place has a post office its own in the store all right and I think I forgot to set my timer I just put on 30 minutes okay because I don't know how long I've been preaching okay I had a meeting there and it looked to me like a good squirrel hunting country so I want to go back down and Mr wood said brother brand I know where there's a man who's got about five or six hundred acres and has got Hills and Hollows I'm going to jump a little bit it'd be wet we could walk in the creek bottom wouldn't scare them he's an Infidel well I said let's go try him I said maybe we better go but if you know him I better set in the car he said all right so he got out and walked around and said how do you do he said my name's wood he said my name is bankswood he said oh I just wonder if it'd be possible if we could hunt here a a little while said we've been hunting over here on another Creek he said' it's dry over there we can't hunt he said are you Jim Woods boy now his father was a reader in the Jehovah's Witnesses he's one of the readers say honest very fine man he said I'm his son he said well Jim Wood is one of the most honest people I've ever met said you just have your choice huh anywhere you want to I said thank you sir I brought my pastor along I guess it's all right for him to go and I look what this old man says he said you don't mean you got so low down you have to carry a preacher around with you everywhere you go I thought I better get out so I got out the car this brother B talking and walked around and said' how do you do he said 'ow do you do he said OU know I guess I'm kind of hard against guys like you fellas I said 'well every man to his thought yeah I just wanted to hunt so I guess you can every fellow to his own thought he said yes there's nothing I have against you but just one thing you're barking up the wrong tree how many knows what that means a lion dog you see barking the is here when he's gone there ain't a up there see he said well I've been on this country here here that old chimney up there is where the original home burned about 60 years ago my father built this place I've lived here walked over these places I'm 76 years old I've never seen no God no angel no nothing else therefore there isn't none look how brother BR handles it well of course that's still to your opinion I said was you ever in church he said no I don't believe in going there was one fellow one time that come in here about two years ago from Indiana I had a place over there they had a meeting the meth's campgrounds I forget the guy's name if I ever meet him I want to talk to him he said wait he lives up here on the ridge by the name of something she was dying with cancer her we had her out to Louisville to the cancer specialist and they tried to operate it was in the stomach and she said she was so wound up through her stomach and intestinal tract they couldn't even wash her with an anema or enema and they just brought her home to die and said she gotten so low till they couldn't put her on the bed pan no more just had to use the draw sheet said wife and I would go up twice a day change your bed she was dying and then he said this preacher was over here at Acton he was there for two nights and he said her sister lives down there another Creek about 30 miles below she went up there that night and said the man never was in this country before and he said he was standing on the platform looked out across about 1500 people and said a lady there by the name of such and such when you left home tonight you put a little white handkerchief in your pocket you got off a marble toop dresser and it's got a little blue working in the corner you got a sister named so and so that's dying with cancer go take that handkerchief and put it on the sister for thus sayi the Lord she shall live and said about 11 o'clock in the night I thought that they had the Salvation up Army up there on the top of the hill of all the noise and said it woke me up I said to my wife well she died and so tomorrow morning I'll get my wagon to take her out the only way you could get where she lived we'd have to bring her out to where you could get her to the car with the wagon said I'll just wait till the morning and said we'll go get her and bring her out but he said the next morning wife and I got up early to go out there and what did we find when we went in but she was eating fried apple pies at the table with her husband and said she's up there now she don't only do her own work but she does her neighbor's work and I thought uhoh here it is and I said ow you don't believe that look at brother brandom the the infidels telling brother brandom about brother bram's Ministry and brother Ram's like oh you don't believe that story do you and he said well if you don't believe it go up and see for yourself brother said look now the Infidel is preaching to [Laughter] me said how I went to ask that man how did he know that that woman was up there he never was in the country before she was dying with cancer how did she know or how did he know she was dying with cancer how did he know her name and how did he know that was her sister how did he know that she was going to get well when that handkerchief was put on her said I want to talk to him when I see him I said I hope you do so he turned around it was for about about the middle of August it's red real hot and the leaves beginning to fall in the trees and brother Bram said you mind if I have one of them apples and he said oh the yellow jackets are eating them how knows what a Yellow Jack is so they're eating them you might as well I said strange thing you notice we haven't even had a frost we haven't had a cool spell or nothing and yet all those leaves are dropping off the tree I said I wonder why that is he said well the life left the leaf and now brother bram's gonna get into proving God so now listen carefully a leaf h a tree losing his Leaf can help you prove God did you know that that's true I said the life left the leaf he said yes I said where did it go he said down in the root of a tree oh I said what' to go down there for he saidwell to keep out of the winter said you see it gets about 20 below zero here if that life was up in the tree the life would die it's got to go down into the root I said oh I see uhhuh I went to ask you a question you know that tree don't have any intelligence because it's just a tree a part of botney life I said whatat kind of intelligence tells it before the frost Falls get out of there right quick so what intelligence is telling the sap to go down to the roots brother manam said run down the route and hide if you don't you're GNA die what intelligence does that well he said that's just nature I said well I'll tell you he said take a bucket of water and set it on the post out there in August and let me see all that water run down the bottom of the post and then come back again this spring so brother man is very this very uh inspired thought if sap sap has to run down on an intelligence right just like water if you put water on the top of a post and give it a a plastic line to go down it's not going to go down on its own right that's what brother R saying the sap can't go down on its own something's got to move it down there just like the water has to be it would have to be moved down there water doesn't move on its own does ever understand that he said oh I hadn't thought of that and I said you think of that he said you think of that while I go World hunting and then when I come back if you will tell me what intelligence tells that sap in that tree that life go down in the roots and hide till spring then come back again when you find out what intelligence works that life up and down through that tree at the seasons I'll tell you what intelligence told me that woman was gonna be healed Glory he said told you yes sir he said you're not that preacher he said I said' I'm brother brandom he said ' can you prove it sure I guess I don't look like it said ' no I admire that you look human and I said 'well well all right sir he said are you the minister yes sir the same God that can speak to a tree can speak to a man and there I led the old fellow to Christ am is that beautiful see something has to speak to sap to go down into the into the roots right just like water will not go down a pole by itself unless you push it or something like that something to move that sap and then something's got to send it back up what life what tells that sap to do that it's God brother brandom said and the same God that give intelligence to move sap up and down a tree is the same God that told Brother Bram the thoughts and intents of the hearts amen Bram said year later I come back and he' went to meet the Lord and the wife told me brother Bram he died in Victory praising God what was it he seen God speaking in his Universe of all the things that he had seen and yet the very nature of a declared to him that there was a god see and he found it and Found Jesus Christ as his savior you like that by God's grace let's give that a round of applause praise God Amen I love that one there's an intelligence in nature it's not the sap sap Sap's not smart right there's got to be something telling that plant to do that and that's God that's God's life that he put in there amen remember the old fisherman story let's go through I'm not sure if this one's longer or shorter but B said what is it it's God God's provided way God makes a way not long ago there's a little preacher a little minister in a nearby City and he thought maybe he knew Lots about the thing and there's a little boy that went to his church and he asked his mother well first little boy asked his pastor Pastor I've heard you speak so much of God could anybody see God well the Pastor said no honey said nobody can see God and live now that's actually a scripture but that pastor's got it mixed up a little bit you can't see the invisible Spirit of but you can see God's manifestations can't you you could see Angels you could see the pillar of fire you could see different manifestations of God you see the Holy Spirit like a a tongue of fire right lick of fire over foreheads you could see that well he was just a Sunday school boy and he asked his mother and his mother didn't know he asked his Sunday school teacher she didn't know said no one could see God he was so disappointed he used to stay up the river near the Six Mile Island up there there's an old fisherman there that had long beard he hung around with this old man so this little Sunday school boy hung around this old fisherman all the time one day up the river they were and a storm came up and after the storm they came down the river any Boatman here knows what the rhythm of oing your boat and feel of the Waves tips the ores you know and the old man looked around the Sun had come out there was a rainbow setting the leaves were all washed off and pretty the old man kept pulling his boat tears begin to roll down his cheeks he'd pull p a little further and look back again the little fell sitting in the CER of the boat became so enthused till he run up in the middle of the boat and said sir I'm gonna ask you a question my mother couldn't answer my father couldn't answer my pastor my Sunday school teacher no one could answer me said I believe there's a God and said could I ever see him it was too much for the old fisherman he just pulled his ores in through his hands to his face and wept like a baby he reached and put his arms around the little boy and said God bless your heart honey all I've seen for the past 35 years has been God hallelujah why sure there was so much God on the inside he could see him on the outside amen I like that we got to get God on the inside when you get God on the inside you can see God on the outside in nature if you want to see God in his Universe get him on the inside watch how the birds sing differently in the trees even your enemy looks differently he says when God he's in his Universe he's in you looking out showing you the Magnificent part of his Universe amen a little girl coming from Sunday school this one's even shorter I think remember this one he asked the little girl one day who was coming from Sunday school why did she waste her time on doing such a thing as that she said because she believed that there was a God and Mr dorsy said that he said child you are so wrong to believe in such a thing as that and said that the little girl stooped down and picked up a little flower off the ground pulled it from its petals and said Mr dorsy could you tell me how this flower lives there it was when she be to search back she could have said to the child or he could have said to the child well it's growing in the earth and then the questions would revolve back where did the Earth come from how did that sea get here how did that happen and on and on and on and run it back until he's seen see not the great glamorous things that we think of about but it's the simple things that God is so real the simplicity so it pleases God to reveal himself and then hide himself amen you like that one that one goes back to the original seed praise God the spoken word is the Original Seed so if you start with well where did this flower get life well from a seed where does that seed get life from and you take it all the way back pretty soon you end up with what the beginning right uh the first mover and that had to be God hallelujah there's another one now let me see many more I got here by God's grace here's the Infidel on the street I think you might like that one and then the Kentucky man who didn't believe in Divine Healing this one's a pretty long one okay let's see is that who's that Caris is that hav best her heart I told my wife I said sometimes I have the effect on people I put them to sleep let's go through this one this is a good one this is one of my favorite stories uh the Infidel on the street brother Bram had just got saved and an Infidel tried to argue with him brother br's out preaching on the street don't you like that he's a Street Preacher I like that at the beginning of his ministry here some time ago I was speaking with an Infidel down the street he said look here Jesus of Nazareth this Infidel studied to be a Roman priest and got sour against the thing he went back out into the world and become a perfect Infidel and I was on one corner preaching he was up in the little lot there in New Albany out in the park with a Bible laying there and said that he said that Bible's Orest ornest book ever written it a it ain't even shouldn't be put in the public literature or out amongst public literature and things said oh it was so deceiving it was all he called it and me on the other Corner preaching the gospel and he said if I'll prove to you brother Rand there's no such thing as God will you accept it I said yes sir and I was well just a kid then I didn't know too much about the scripture I don't yet tonight but I know the author of it that's the main thing so then he said well how many senses do the human body and he was a smart man and I said see taste feel smell and here said all right if he was a human God now as they claim he was he was made manifest here among us then one of these five human senses ought to declare him and he said is that right well a gang of people the Infidel and the preacher together so you know what caused it or what it caused here come everybody running up you see so have an Infidel and a preacher kind of debating I like that I said well that sounds reasonable why he said said all right did you ever see your God I said well yes sir one night he said now let me see him so see what he's saying he said have you ever seen God he's like yeah he said well then show them to me let me see him I said well of course of course you're lost he said see we ain't talking about faith I want my sense of sight just the same as yours and if You' see him let me see him I said well I saw him by Vision he said well let me see the vision see you can't give somebody a vision right Visions are gifts and calling of God are without repentance she's saying basic give me that gift and you can't give anybody that gift I said well you don't oh not believe now no no you can't cut me off he said you never did see him you never did feel him so see you never can't feel God and brother man said oh no I felt him the Infidel said no well if you felt him let me feel him my sense of feeling is just as good as yours and it's the same sense said bring him here let me feel him here and I'll believe him said you said you felt him I said I feeled him in my heart he said well let me feel him that way I said Well if you get down and believe he said no not your psychology I want to know truth and he was holding well I know I wasn't up against no little boy and he chewed that tobacco you know spit it out like that I said well don't spit on my foot sir and he said well see well you were all tied up here aren't you he said you never did see him feel him taste him smell him or hear him and there therefore if none of these five senses won't declare them then there's no such a thing and quit your nonsense around here deceiving the people I thought oh my that's quite an argument huh well you're saying you uh he you felt god with your senses but you can't let me feel God with my senses that's quite an argument brother BR said Oh my he said now if he was a human God you believe that he was human yes sir I believe Jesus Christ was human and he rose from the dead as among man today yes sir I believe that he rose from that body yes sir that's right all right then let me see him let me see one of the senses declare Jesus in other words and oh he had a pretty stiff argument I thought oh Lord I'd been preaching about three months then I thought what am i g to do I said Lord you told me to take no thought what I'd say that you said you'd add it at that time I thought Lord what can I do in my heart I was praying I begin to see something you know what they say give a cow enough rope it'll hang itself that's about right so I begin to see something moving up the Holy Spirit moving up I said ' that's true I certainly I believe you got he said 'oh you begin to come to yourself aren't you I said maybe I am I said I tell you you're a really smart man you got a good mind buddy look at this he said well my mother never raised no fools and he spit like that I said well you're a really smart man you got a good mind he said sure I got a good mind now get away from all that kind of stuff I said just a moment did you say you had a mind he said why sure I said I don't believe it he said well what's the matter with you you must have lost the mind you had I said no no if you I said is it a human mind because remember he said does Jesus have a human body so brother B asked do you have a human mind he said why yes I said well come on I was a gentleman with you you be a gentleman with me you want to embarrass me now come was it a human mind he said why yes I said if it's a human mind one of the human senses ought to declare I like that I said how many senses is the body and he said so he tells him you know tells him all five senses he says see taste feel I said did you ever see your mind see do you ever smell your mind do you ever taste your mind do you ever feel your mind did you ever hear your mind he said no sir I said then you haven't got any mind that's right you're just absolutely without a mind he said well I know I got a mind and I said I know I got a God too and that's just exactly amen so see it goes back to that point we made earlier about Bill and N the science guy he knows he has something that the five senses cannot declare he can't deny it and he has no idea how it got there well brother brandom used that argument uh to get over on this Infidel he says oh everything you believe has to be able to be seen proved by the five senses and brother BR said your mind can't be proven by the five senses that's right because right now you can picture can you get a picture of brother brandom in your mind right now or Jesus Christ get a picture and yet you're looking at me how can you do that because you got a mind I can't touch that you can't touch that you can't feel that hear that taste that or smell that but you can do it because it's something spiritual and that's the argument where brother Bram got the upper hand on him amen God gave us uh we all see that's God's knowledge revealed inside every man amen God's power is manifested in every man we all have something that's Supernatural inside of us didn't brother B say that that everybody has a Supernatural part to them Hallelujah and one of the boys was standing there and had a rose pinned on his lapel and I pulled the pin out like that I thought I would have a little fun out of him then I walked over where he was and I said now you see what I mean and I stuck him on the arm with a pin a needle he said hey I said did you feel that he said said yes and I said he was going to slap me then so I said I didn't feel that poke I didn't feel it he said well let me stick you I said that's what I thought I said that's right if you accept the same Jesus Christ that I've accepted and now you will feel him the same way I feel him just exactly let the pin stick the other way let's give that around PA like that one praise God Amen see if you if you surrender your Supernatural part if you surrender your human Spirit you'll experience God but you have to surrender that part that's a proof of God Amen Hallelujah it proves it to an Infidel see they they can't say everything has to be proved by the five senses because God put something Supernatural in every person amen I'm doing pretty good on time okay I got about eight minutes here now this is where it all kind of came to me because brother tells a story about a Kentucky man who didn't believe in Divine Healing in the Ephesian Church age sermon from 1960 this one's really simple and wonderful too it reminds me of John chapter 1 where Jesus told uh Peter James and John I believe he said or Peter Peter and j John I think it was if I'm not mistaken or Nathaniel yeah he said if you believe this he said you'll see greater things in this you'll see the son of man or Angels ascending and descending on the son of man so in other words if you can believe God a little bit you'll see more of it amen so here's the story last one here one time down in Kentucky I was having a meeting fell come out and he said oh I don't believe that healing I said well it's all right you're American he said I don't believe anything unless I see it I said well it's all right he said no I ain't got nothing against you but I don't believe what you're saying I said it's your American privilege you don't have to he said now I never accept nothing unless I can see it plainly H I said well now that's good you must be from Missouri because Missouri is the show me state brother makes a joke with him oh you have to see it to believe it you must be from Missouri said no I'm a kuckian woo don't sound very good for Kentucky I said but anyhow I said if you that's the way you think you go ahead and I said how are you going home he said I'm going across the hill I live over well go over with me nice man said go home with me and stay all night brother Braham so the man invites brother Braham over even though he don't de believe in Divine Healing he liked brother Braham enough to invite him over to stay the night with him brother bam said I wish I could brother but I said I'm going up here with my uncle and he said and I said you want a ride over nope I got to go up across the hill up there up this way and down a hollow and up and you know how it is down there and I said well I said how you gonna get up how you gonna get there he said I'm going up The Path there why I said now here's where brother Ram starts bringing in this this wrong thought the thought is I gotta see it to believe it so brother Ram starts Reb or correcting him or on this thought right here he said why you can't even see your hand before you it's so dark I said how going to get up there he said I've got a lantern I said well how do you what do you think or what what do you do light the lantern then walk with it he said yes sir I love the Simplicity brother brandom used I said when you light that Lantern can you hold it up high like this I'd like to see your house he said no you can't see it I said then how you gonna get there oh he said I'll just light the Lantern and as I walk I just walk as the light and I said that that's just it amen just walk in the light so brother B is saying oh you can't see your house so how do you believe it he said I know it's there if I just keep holding the light I'll eventually get there and brother Bon said just keep walking don't stand still you'll never get nowhere if you've been saved walk to sanctification amen you say how do you get there just keep walking is the baptism of the Holy Ghost after sanctification how do I get that he said just keep walking in the light how about his signs wonders and miracles he said just keep walking in the light see just keep on every time you make a step the light will jump just a little ahead of you because he's always ahead of you he don't push he leads amen he is the light oh I'm so glad of that aren't you he's the light in him there is no Darkness praise God can you trust God to if you can trust God to walk the little light he'll take you all the way to where you need to go praise God okay I got about four minutes now I have um I did some Bible proofs here I watched a video about scientific research in the Bible and so I'll probably just do one or two I'll just probably I got about 11 of these or 12 of these is the Bible scientific books I think you'll like these by God's grace yes it is because number one the Earth's free flow in space was foretold by job job said the Earth hangeth the Earth or God hangeth the Earth upon nothing amen is the Bible scientific it's very scientific praise God is it Supernatural it's very Supernatural praise God now the Earth's free flow in space was written by job at about 1520 BC that's when job's book was written it was a little bit right after uh Moses's time at least that's what uh the Scofield bible says now science discovered Earth's free flow in space around 300 to 400 ad so God told this fact about 1,800 years before science discovered it amen we got a pretty good science book here Church you like that Amen brother Ram proves god with these simple little illustrations you know and it's so true and science continues uh the Bible continues to prove the science the correct science as well amen now if you look up Universe on britanica because I have a subscription to that it says in the 4th Century BCE I can't say that name ponticus a follower of uh Pythagoras taught that the spherical Earth rotated freely in space and that Mercury and Venus revolved around the Sun so there's a history to back that up amen so the Bible's very scientific what was it 1,00 years before science figured out God already told him amen number two the expanding of the universe you know this is just up until recently most people thought the the universe was fixed and was eternal most atheists thought that but now they know the the universe is actually expanding because the Bible said this in Psalms 104:2 God covers himself with light as a with a garment and he stretches out the heavens like a curtain this is written in the Book of Psalms about a th BC and science discover this somewhere between 1900 and 1950 that's when science discovered uh that the universe is actually expanding and just so you know the planets are not expanding space is expanding in the planets just it's just a little detail uh the planets remain the same ma size and matter and everything like that the stars do what's expanding is the space the literal space that everything sits in so things are getting further away okay that's called the receding of the galaxies and I was reading about that yesterday as well so that's what's expanding so like Earth is not getting bigger or we're not getting bigger uh but the space itself is expanding now look at this science discovered this from 1900 1950 God told this almost 3,000 years before science figured it out God is so wise his book of science is always right praise God and if you look up expanding Universe it talks about Edwin Hubble and he used observations from Isaac Newton with the law of relativity and uh receding galaxies some other scientists discovered receding galaxies galaxies that are moving farther away from each other because space is stretching out and he used that uh to do a discovery to discover that the universe is expanding yeah I'll just read that right there the universe is expanding and there's a lot of stuff I don't understand right there but see they can actually date it they can actually they get an idea because the universe is expanding they can get about a date when uh when it began now remember brother brandom said history is only 6,000 years old right but he said the universe might be millions and trillions of years old remember he said that he said because out of God came the logos and out of logos came all the creation and God the logos stopped all the planets and everything and all the stars and then he started you know making love to the Earth and brought forth all the seeds and then we know that so that thought that's very inspiring very inspired from the Bible praise the Lord okay I got one more minute I'll just close on this one the hygiene practice of washing hands and running water that don't sound very scientific but it was very it is very scientific because of microorganisms right so levius 15:13 there's my time that's about an hour so this my last one this is of course God's uh God's word to Moses and when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing and wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in running water water and he shall be clean so God commands if you're going to be clean from this infection you must use running water now here's a man named uh ignaz seawise and you can look him up he's on he's all over all the you look on Wikipedia or Botanica or whatever you want he ordered the students uh to wash their hands in a solution now this he's at a hospital he ordered the students to wash their hands and chlorinated lime before each examination because they would examine women who were sick and they would go from sick women to pregnant women and they would spread disease that way and many about I think up to 40% of women died because they would take these microorganisms these uh these diseases on their hands they would take them right over there from a a woman dying to a woman giving birth or who just given birth under these procedures the mortality rates in the first division dropped from 18.27% to 1.2% and in March and August of 1848 no woman died in child birth in his division amen so God told Moses this in about 1490 BC and seis discovered this in 1848 3,300 years God told it before science discovered it how many love the how many love the Lord tonight let's stand to our feet by God's grace like I said I just got a chance to maybe do part one I got a lot more uh like the life is in the blood and how the Earth is a sphere I know Austin I been talking about how people say it's a FL Earth but I still believe it's a sphere I still do because the Bible say it's the heart of the earth the earth has a heart the Earth has a center amen and then oceanography there's a very famous man oh this is this was just burned in my heart Matthew Mari read the Bible he read psalms 8 ver8 and said where the Bible said there's paths in the sea and he went out and discovered the ocean currents just by reading the Bible
