[19:19] it's how that song thank you
[19:24] that's wrong I agree meaning in my life
[19:37] after I came to the Lord I'm going to
[19:45] show us a little a little bit because
[19:52] God had been doing too many great things
[19:55] in my life the most great everything
[20:02] that happened to me it was when he
[20:06] called me before he called me I was an
[20:11] unbeliever I persecute the Christians
[20:17] and I was trading in my country not to
[20:22] believe in God and in that way I spent
[20:29] too many years and for some reason it
[20:41] was it was in the devil hand you know so
[20:47] my thing was no good at all and I was a
[20:55] young man know the world like I am right
[21:01] now but the life has one meaning for me
[21:05] now
[21:06] value was before almost 6 years ago I
[21:16] came to this world
[21:19] and I have a great father a great mother
[21:25] I am very proud about them and they they
[21:35] did the best to me because I was a
[21:39] firstborn and they sent me to the school
[21:46] through with a lot of difficulties we
[21:52] want and really really poverty and to go
[21:58] from my house to the school we had to go
[22:01] to to the mall and my mommy carry me on
[22:05] her shoulders yes to make me go to the
[22:11] school clean I hope God give her a
[22:21] reward for that you know I will make it
[22:29] shorter because I want to listen
[22:31] something for my brother yes please
[22:36] forgive me in 1990 in 1990 we have a new
[22:47] government in my country so Nicaragua
[22:52] although although you know and at that
[22:56] time I don't have a job and only was
[23:02] something like a vagabond life I I don't
[23:06] miss it my father's house nobody
[23:09] obviously from town to town
[23:12] spend spend the life or living the life
[23:17] we call that but really really is
[23:19] killing the life you know and one day
[23:26] one day I found I found a woman
[23:30] and the highway waiting for the bus to
[23:34] go from one village to the village where
[23:36] I live I stop and I offer to her awry
[23:41] and and I give a ride to her to her
[23:46] house and after a few days I start to
[23:57] visit this lady and six month later she
[24:03] become to be my wife you know we don't
[24:09] know how God works just we know that he
[24:12] does and this is the point over here the
[24:22] she she wasn't message over ten years
[24:27] when I met her but she know that I was
[24:34] unbelievable so the less I want to talk
[24:39] about that it was a religion and so she
[24:44] never talked about religion to me and
[24:49] while we get married and her pastor he
[24:54] came to visit to her on the house and
[24:58] every time when I saw him after work I
[25:01] hate him
[25:04] yeah and I say what's going over here
[25:09] what this man is doing over here you
[25:12] don't have nothing to do why he don't
[25:14] have to go somewhere else and I thought
[25:18] what I thought
[25:19] that one might thought I never talked
[25:21] about that I just only thought about
[25:24] that and but every time when I saw that
[25:28] man on the street I just must say myself
[25:31] I hate this
[25:34] [Music]
[25:38] for some reason I mean this is the
[25:44] education that I get from my father's
[25:46] they training me to I will call training
[25:51] but I think it was a good seed that they
[25:54] plan on me
[25:55] it was reading books and through my
[26:01] whole life I've been reading I will read
[26:04] unreal more than five or six thousand
[26:06] books yeah when I went to the school I
[26:10] spend my free time and the library
[26:14] reading and reading and reading always
[26:17] before school and after school and I had
[26:24] the honor to share the same profession
[26:26] but I Jesse I am a teacher I never told
[26:30] you and I am AG unaccountable so but I
[26:40] never I never having a school a charge
[26:44] so I try never were like a teacher but
[26:50] it's a but it's a it's a good job I love
[26:55] it because I read a lot I read a lot too
[27:00] many I read too many books not this one
[27:03] and I went to the library in my country
[27:11] so I check all the books pretty much all
[27:13] of them read it and I remember also I I
[27:21] lost my job
[27:24] someday in John probably or june/july my
[27:30] wife has a book like this but all this
[27:34] altogether was ten message the spoken
[27:38] word was attendee yes stick together in
[27:42] one book and I don't I don't remember
[27:46] the name of the other ones right now I
[27:48] don't even think I remember
[27:51] but just one in particular the this
[27:59] message is spiritual food and the season
[28:03] and the reason why I remember that
[28:09] message it's because I had to use some
[28:15] pictures so please forgive me for this
[28:18] dollar is that my brain is almost blown
[28:25] out so I had to remember to the pictures
[28:33] and the third page and that book it was
[28:38] a picture and for somebody like me that
[28:46] never never want to learn about God and
[28:50] I started to read something because I
[28:53] had nothing to read I got this broken
[28:57] and the Turkish and that message
[28:59] spiritual food and the season with the
[29:01] speech it wasn't this way it was non
[29:11] decide it was very small in the cup of
[29:13] the book and and I look the picture and
[29:24] it was something like a supernatural
[29:28] open my eyes it was something that I
[29:32] cannot I just see the picture and move
[29:42] there move the page but the first time a
[29:49] sheriff
[29:51] and I I just say how god them came to me
[29:57] before I just start crying and I'd feel
[30:10] ridiculous I feel miserable or you can
[30:24] give to me it was like that in this
[30:29] picture I saw him I couldn't stop I was
[30:40] crying and crying probably for about an
[30:42] hour or something like that
[30:45] my wife was washing the clothes and she
[30:51] look at me she was a little scared
[30:54] something and I start to talk to her and
[30:58] I told him this is some strange I
[31:01] consider Jesus cry face over here and
[31:05] she start by a nose
[31:08] and she told me the first person the can
[31:11] see that's crazy
[31:17] and so that was the way how the Lord
[31:23] talked to me the first time this picture
[31:29] it was and I start to talk to her ask
[31:34] ask how how this is possible
[31:39] how a simple picture for me come talk to
[31:45] me in that way sit on me I'm going to
[31:50] call the pastor so he can explain to you
[31:54] much better and remember the man that I
[32:02] really don't like it
[32:06] here we come - with my best friend I
[32:12] love him he'll really pass away by he
[32:16] become to be my best friend
[32:19] we were good friends and he said
[32:25] explained to me what what the light was
[32:29] from those days you know because that
[32:31] this message the life today is led that
[32:37] the like we will hurt tomorrow
[32:38] but the light we got today must what we
[32:42] get gesture is from light to light from
[32:46] glory to glory you know and I want to
[32:51] share what I what I can see I I don't
[32:57] say sure this is what you had to believe
[32:59] no I want to share one how this come to
[33:03] me when I when I saw this picture I
[33:13] start to talk with that with the pastor
[33:16] I I start to go deeper and and some
[33:21] message they wonder my why have and and
[33:26] the pastor borrow me when it was a it is
[33:34] rising the song brother banner is
[33:46] talking about this picture in this way
[33:48] and goodness in this way well you'll
[33:54] turn the picture like this and look and
[33:57] you come and you can probably see it
[34:00] from the audience is Christ see his eyes
[34:05] look and here just a perfect that is
[34:07] Colby wearing the white wake of super
[34:11] supreme deity and judge on all heaven on
[34:14] earth can you see his eyes
[34:18] no his mom this is what I see before I
[34:22] read the message
[34:24] just turn the picture from from this way
[34:28] the white is supposed to be can you see
[34:32] it he's the supreme judge there is not
[34:35] there is none other but him and that is
[34:39] a perfect
[34:40] identification again a vindication that
[34:42] this message in the truth and there was
[34:51] a question for me this message is that
[34:53] true if something start burning in me it
[35:02] was something had to be more than that
[35:04] you know is literally I feel like I can
[35:11] touch God but the way how I feel it see
[35:19] see you see the dark his faith his birth
[35:22] and his eyes and knowledge he's looking
[35:25] from him comes this light shining on the
[35:29] right hand you know there you know the
[35:35] story and this and this came to make
[35:37] another question to me when brother
[35:41] Brandon say as john the baptist was sent
[35:43] to forerun the first coming of christ
[35:47] your message will further on the second
[35:50] coming and that was something that start
[35:56] to to work over here you know and my
[36:02] pastor tell me take your time because
[36:06] and there is nothing I can do for you
[36:09] about that but God can do it he will
[36:14] reveal not now
[36:16] probably not now but he will do induces
[36:21] and their season is a there was a
[36:29] something like those were keep in mind
[36:34] always always always and something
[36:38] telling me if I didn't call you before
[36:41] you because it wasn't not your time you
[36:43] know and that message is spiritual
[36:50] foolin on the seasons that one day
[36:51] turning into the right look and there
[36:53] was Jesus Christ just a perfect as
[36:55] Hoffman ever draw him in the same way
[37:00] that I saw him and and after that I
[37:04] found on the message in this way say
[37:06] he's looking down you know he's looking
[37:12] down to the air you know and you know
[37:23] the rest of the story I want to make it
[37:26] shorter and but I start to see this
[37:35] picture he was the only one that I have
[37:37] in my hand and my wife had the seven
[37:43] seals book I start to read that book I
[37:48] had no revelation at all no I just want
[37:53] to read something but every word that I
[37:56] read it was graven in my heart and he
[38:01] talked about the pyramid those seven
[38:04] angels and I saw in this way the pyramid
[38:15] [Music]
[38:22] you know that's the way I saw the
[38:24] pyramid and he's talking about their
[38:36] that this message is a four equals about
[38:47] the explained about how they equal
[38:50] comply that is not become very higher or
[38:53] has a mission like eagles and you know
[38:57] has to be something special for equals
[39:00] so it's in this way that I saw the eagle
[39:04] [Music]
[39:26] and sevensee is wonderful show me that
[39:37] in this picture need the Lamb of God you
[39:41] know
[40:03] and it was some something supernatural
[40:09] you know I cannot explain to you it's
[40:13] only the way how the message came to me
[40:17] and well the face you know and I saw
[40:34] [Music]
[40:52] before you came in different way you
[40:55] know this is this is the only the way
[41:02] that this came to me grating something I
[41:16] want deeper and deeper and deeper about
[41:19] this this cloud this power really got
[41:25] all my attention and and I will when I I
[41:31] saw something on this the Seventh Seal
[41:35] well you know and the message sir what
[41:42] time is it oh this is a sign of the
[41:45] answer he's talking about the vision of
[41:48] angels and how they come and make a
[41:53] premium you know you know the story and
[41:57] but it was something supernatural that I
[42:00] saw over here and the Seventh Seal they
[42:05] missed the brother Brown say did you
[42:08] notice that
[42:09] one angel I say in there was I extreme
[42:15] in yoga he looking more to me than any
[42:19] of the rest of them you remember that
[42:23] they were in the constellation three on
[42:27] the side and one on the top and the one
[42:31] right next to me here counting from the
[42:34] left to the right keep that in mind
[42:41] counting from the left to the right will
[42:45] it be in the seven Angelo
[42:47] he was brighter meant more to me that
[42:51] the rest of them you remember I say he
[42:54] had the chest out like that and was
[42:56] flying is worth you remember like that
[42:59] and I say it picked me up lift lifted me
[43:02] up do you remember that here it is the
[43:07] one with the Seventh Seal the theme that
[43:10] I've been wondering all my life amen
[43:13] them other sealed meant a lot to me of
[43:15] course but oh you don't know what this
[43:18] has meant he said that the angel that he
[43:24] saw at the right side counting left to
[43:35] right what the seven anger the picture
[43:44] ladies it a nice lady's counting from
[43:53] left to right the seven angel was more
[43:59] brightly now it for me
[44:03] it's for me I can triple the burhan
[44:07] space over here
[44:12] this is a little bit lighter this
[44:15] teacher verified you put a little bit
[44:18] darker you will see much much better the
[44:22] picture and I say and this make a simple
[44:27] for me when he said that he will lift
[44:30] her up for these angels and he was in
[44:34] that constellation you know and what is
[44:41] what I understand for me that he sold
[44:46] his celestial body you know it was the
[44:51] most important for him because it he got
[44:53] that Seventh Seal
[44:54] revelation thing that everything he said
[44:59] all the other things that mean a lot for
[45:01] me but this was more important because
[45:04] it was everything on it and after I want
[45:13] to talk to them I was very hungry for
[45:24] the word of God but that's the way only
[45:28] how the message came to me and after
[45:33] that it's been days and nights reading
[45:38] the message days and nights and you will
[45:44] say like I have I was so crazy but a 2
[45:47] or 3 o clock in the morning I just cry
[45:50] and I say look how I waste my time
[45:57] before you know it is really when I look
[46:05] to my past I feel like I feel so really
[46:10] bad but when I look to my present and I
[46:13] say how God rescued me I don't have any
[46:18] words to express my gratitude
[46:22] is this me like all the blood of Jesus I
[46:28] want nothing for me you know but now is
[46:31] a special meaning you know is was well
[46:39] and what the words say that we are buy
[46:43] it with expensive price when they had a
[46:50] talk with somebody over there in my
[46:52] country and they said even if I don't if
[46:55] I never commit scene I mean if I make a
[47:00] decision today for you my blood is not
[47:02] going to save you but it was a match it
[47:10] came to the glory just only that blood
[47:19] can rescue me I start to visit all the
[47:29] people that I hate before and the grace
[47:35] the grace of the Lord I had to accept
[47:42] that I was so bad but Lord gave me an
[47:46] upgrade to go over there on fixing all
[47:50] my problems and be humble and ask for
[47:52] pardon and Sabian's forgive me because I
[47:58] I say these and about you I thought this
[48:02] about you
[48:02] I forgive me because I hate you but now
[48:07] I mister loving you and it is a heart
[48:16] it's very hard it's not easy
[48:19] we know easy
[48:25] like I told to brother Jesse a couple
[48:29] weeks ago for the Christian is like a
[48:32] fish is very easy to swallow the bite we
[48:36] hook the heartiness take it out you know
[48:41] because all from inside has to come out
[48:45] and I I just wish that every team but I
[48:48] have burning me out you know out because
[48:57] brother Brandon saying it in the book
[48:59] adoption that just one of those kind of
[49:04] stop the work of the church you know and
[49:13] it was not too many message in 1990 and
[49:17] I start to visit different churches and
[49:26] my country looking for message I was not
[49:31] looking for fellowship I was looking for
[49:34] message I want to get more books I want
[49:38] to know more more you know and they you
[49:45] start to show me what they have and I
[49:47] said no I have that one I heard that one
[49:49] I heard that one
[49:50] no I don't have this one let me make a
[49:53] copy and I'm I start to make copy the
[49:55] message well I don't have and this
[50:01] hungry made me trouble to Central
[50:04] America all this country's all those
[50:09] countries I visit all the churches
[50:13] Guatemala El Salvador Honduras Costa
[50:16] Rica until I get like about 400 message
[50:23] I copied all of them and this was some
[50:29] kind of blessing for my the church him
[50:31] in my village because they don't have
[50:34] also it's a man of message and they
[50:37] start to make a copy there so it was it
[50:44] was such a blessing you know and in a
[50:49] few
[50:50] I feel like I was living in a different
[50:53] world after after I can't see anybody in
[50:58] my house my house was the most visit and
[51:02] we talk about the world every day every
[51:04] day every day and we had no time we will
[51:09] walk in the street and in the street
[51:12] started talking about the message at two
[51:14] o'clock three o'clock in the morning in
[51:16] the street and the people open the
[51:18] windows to see who are the people
[51:20] talking I never get tired I never get a
[51:27] girl gave me energy but so I make my
[51:35] family for my mom and my father we are
[51:39] eight brothers and sister now for the
[51:43] grace of the Lord we are millions we are
[51:50] millions around the world
[51:52] I don't I just make one but I think at
[52:00] the grace of the Lord now I want to
[52:05] share it there are miracles God they can
[52:11] make you know he's the miracle makers in
[52:17] 1992 I was 2 years 3 years after I came
[52:24] to the mercy I was baptized in November
[52:26] 4 1990 27 years ago now the trials came
[52:39] you know yes it's not easy it's not easy
[52:46] and that depends
[52:49] our about our fate you know if our faith
[52:56] is very weak probably we don't have
[52:58] enough trial you know but we don't have
[53:02] an enough restraint to fight but when we
[53:07] when our faith is getting higher
[53:09] they Lord want to test you what kind of
[53:12] fan you have you know how you are going
[53:15] to use it you know because faith like
[53:18] the brothers say this modified his power
[53:21] and 1992 my mom came sick and really
[53:33] really bad and she was in bed and I
[53:39] visit where and and I can see I can see
[53:43] that she was dying I can see that not
[53:48] too much time left for her and I say mom
[53:57] I know I am I never been a good ball for
[54:01] you probably I've been the worst and the
[54:04] family for you and I started to talk to
[54:08] her you know and ask forgive me for all
[54:13] the bad that I was and she told me don't
[54:19] worry don't worry my son I love you I
[54:22] already forgive you said Mother's has a
[54:28] hard you have no idea idea you know even
[54:35] the worst kid for mom is the best they
[54:40] have a heart so big and she get better
[54:45] and better so I don't have another
[54:49] choice the doctors the doctor told me
[54:53] you had to get ready because she's not
[54:57] going to make
[55:01] marry barely she can sir secondly two
[55:05] more months that's all yeah so I talked
[55:15] to the family start to get ready because
[55:18] I'm this she can die in any moment and
[55:25] something came to me it was like a
[55:28] desperation or maybe suka like a
[55:33] revelation something came to me and I
[55:37] called six more brothers from the church
[55:42] with me seven and I call them to pray
[55:51] for my mom you know and and they came to
[55:56] my house
[55:57] I have a I still have a friend
[56:03] the he don't believe in God he don't
[56:05] believe in God but he was talking with
[56:08] one of the brothers and while they were
[56:11] talking we couldn't I start to pay for
[56:14] my mom because they were talking and and
[56:18] that and I was like in a hurry you know
[56:25] I I can't tell him stop you know I just
[56:33] went to my mom's room I just see I pause
[56:39] and this over here like probably like a
[56:46] one hour later they finished and we came
[56:53] to pray for my mom which we call her but
[57:01] she dementia you know and
[57:10] just as you thought well this she's gone
[57:18] and I just concede it's been moving very
[57:22] very slow slow so we decide to to pray
[57:30] from my mom we tie our hands together
[57:38] [Music]
[57:44] all the seven brothers and we started to
[57:49] pray him for my mom after a few seconds
[57:57] it was some kind of power
[58:00] some kind of power like trying to pull
[58:05] out our hand trying to break the chain
[58:09] you know and we get excited with care I
[58:16] will cold scare you no I just remembered
[58:20] I say this war Holy Father give me a
[58:26] strand or keep this chain tie I remember
[58:31] that it was something strong when he
[58:34] stole minister really strong it I
[58:38] remember the roof of my house make an
[58:43] explosion a very big explosion I was
[58:53] scared I was afraid to open my eyes
[58:56] everybody was when they finished to pray
[59:06] we look to the roof everything was
[59:09] normal and I look my mom my mom has open
[59:18] she sit on the bed and I asked her how
[59:23] do you feel mom and she told me I'm okay
[59:27] where you called me say whether you call
[59:33] me and and I said what did what do you
[59:40] mean what do you call me you Sigma no I
[59:43] was nothing I was with my mom I was with
[59:47] my dad and that beautiful garden I she
[59:50] starts to tell me about flowers and
[59:52] house ISM and and I'd say wow my mom
[59:57] made as they my mom made it it was
[1:00:09] something we start crying you know and
[1:00:13] and one of the brother was the doctor
[1:00:17] was right there in the prayer line even
[1:00:23] after the pray he told me two more
[1:00:25] months it ray and it was sunk and I said
[1:00:31] wait a minute God God already gave me my
[1:00:35] mom I don't think it's going to be like
[1:00:39] this you know and too many question came
[1:00:43] to mind to me but the grace and mercy
[1:00:50] came again and the two months the
[1:00:57] doctors say God throw over there
[1:01:02] and the garbage and I have my mom for
[1:01:06] ten more years every year on those ten
[1:01:13] years my mom I had the opportunity to
[1:01:19] give it a message and she came to the
[1:01:22] message I got baptized and when she
[1:01:29] I think I think she made it I don't
[1:01:32] really sure she made it and I the only
[1:01:41] thing I can say is I eyes I have a hope
[1:01:47] I believe that me on the river I hope to
[1:01:52] see her again you know knowing these
[1:01:55] mortal bodies but in those glorified
[1:01:59] bodies than where I think when brother
[1:02:05] Brandon went beyond the curtain time he
[1:02:07] saw my mom you know and I think he saw
[1:02:14] me otherwise I couldn't be here in the
[1:02:16] message because this is the clue this is
[1:02:22] no way that's really that's really great
[1:02:32] is this no unfortunately my dad he died
[1:02:39] a couple years ago but he never want to
[1:02:43] come to the message and you know yes God
[1:02:49] knows why you know it's sometime like a
[1:02:54] human we want to do our best for our low
[1:02:57] ones that we don't know walk us bread
[1:03:03] and and that way I be I had too many
[1:03:12] trials in my life too many too many
[1:03:19] really really when I came to Christ and
[1:03:23] when I have more fight but what I have
[1:03:26] in the world you know but - God - God be
[1:03:32] the victory God without him now there's
[1:03:39] nothing we can do nothing we can do
[1:03:47] now years later year later my daughter
[1:03:58] my daughter has has a little child
[1:04:04] Christopher you know you know
[1:04:10] Christopher a story right the devil try
[1:04:18] to kill him even when he wasn't mom you

[1:17:09] medical I had a history from Christopher
[1:17:12] also my daughter's she don't write see
[1:17:16] it but I keep it because it's a
[1:17:19] testimony
[1:17:19] you know it's a testimony I come to now
[1:17:29] I think it's a couple more teachers oh I
[1:17:36] forgot to say something I listen right
[1:17:39] down over here when Christopher was
[1:17:46] really really bad in a bad shape I went
[1:17:51] to his house and I prayed for him um
[1:18:00] have I make the wrong prayer you know
[1:18:06] and I remember and I recognized you
[1:18:11] because this happened to me fast I say
[1:18:15] I said Lord heal him my days is almost
[1:18:20] over Lord take my life but let him leave
[1:18:27] and he came to to my house and we lay
[1:18:33] down in the bed that day this issue
[1:18:39] restoran me and I was their answer
[1:18:46] because I asked for that you know and I
[1:18:54] said it's something came to my heart and
[1:18:58] see how that is possible how that is
[1:19:01] possible
[1:19:02] you made the wrong prayer you know you
[1:19:07] King asked for life asking dead for you
[1:19:11] and that Sunday two days two or three
[1:19:16] day later brother Simon was over here
[1:19:19] and I came to talk to him and I tell him
[1:19:22] what happened
[1:19:23] I have those issue for two or four days
[1:19:26] and I told to brother Simon what happen
[1:19:29] and he prayed for me and for the glory
[1:19:32] of God that was the day last day I
[1:19:34] houses and he don't have anymore
[1:19:43] is it yet that does show me that I when
[1:19:49] I ask for something I had to do it in
[1:19:51] the right way you know I made a mistake
[1:19:55] and I pay for that yeah we had the
[1:20:04] pyramid now this is Samuel now today
[1:20:10] this is Samuel three days ago three or
[1:20:13] four days
[1:20:15] you know yes amazing okay now we can go
[1:20:27] to the next one this picture rather
[1:20:34] that's the picture that came to me in
[1:20:36] 1990 inviting ID
[1:20:41] I get that picture from the magazine
[1:20:44] only believe and and I read the magazine
[1:20:52] and I say oh I would like to be there
[1:20:56] someday
[1:20:56] I would like to be someday and and and I
[1:21:05] start to think about that talking with
[1:21:07] the pastor and all the brothers in the
[1:21:09] church and I said for me that lamb has
[1:21:14] to be anointing is like you know a nice
[1:21:18] talk about the Prophet that was buried
[1:21:22] long time ago and remember in the Bible
[1:21:25] that when they put in their body they
[1:21:30] throw him and he get life right away you
[1:21:32] know and I'm brother Billy poles tell a
[1:21:35] testimony about a lady her husband was a
[1:21:39] drunk
[1:21:40] I don't man she came to the tournament
[1:21:43] grabbed a little bit dirt and when he
[1:21:46] got drunk threw the dirt on him
[1:21:49] and say in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:21:51] Christ the same anointing I wasn't that
[1:21:54] prophecies in this prophet because
[1:21:56] that's God and she he never don't get
[1:22:00] wrong again
[1:22:01] you know they anoint instill here and
[1:22:06] see so 27 years later 23rd year later
[1:22:13] the grace of the Lord put in my way my
[1:22:19] past brother Jesse we talked about to go
[1:22:26] to

[1:27:02] he'll be really encouraged by that that
[1:27:07] was the last day you had a seizure
[1:27:10] amen amen isn't wonderful to see how God
[1:27:15] gets ahold of everybody praise the Lord
[1:27:18] you know everybody has their unique
[1:27:20] testimony and I love that how God showed
[1:27:24] brother Jose himself in the cloud there
[1:27:27] that was really beautiful and I was
[1:27:29] asking brother Craig about that I said
[1:27:31] you know what do you know about the
[1:27:32] cloud and you know you know believe the
[1:27:34] sign and all these people always attack
[1:27:35] the cloud and whether Craig said did you
[1:27:37] know the very first time brother Branham
[1:27:39] mentioned that life magazine was in the
[1:27:42] standing of the gap and at the end of
[1:27:44] that sermon God vindicated that cloud by
[1:27:47] raising brother away from the dead
[1:27:50] that's this I wouldn't looked it up this
[1:27:52] week that was this that was a sermon
[1:27:54] brother Wade died but I was talking
[1:27:56] about all these nervousness and
[1:27:58] complexes he said brother way you've got
[1:28:00] a complex and all these things and all
[1:28:01] these and then they pretty soon you hear
[1:28:03] him hush down and brother Branham says I
[1:28:05] call for that life in the name of Jesus
[1:28:07] Christ
[1:28:08] that's a brother Craig said see it was
[1:28:10] God indicating that there was life in
[1:28:13] that cloud that cloud represented the
[1:28:16] life of God God coming down to minister
[1:28:20] to his bride aren't you glad they meant
[1:28:22] that Christ come down aren't you glad
[1:28:24] the mighty angels with us healed Samuel
[1:28:27] Hill Christopher
[1:28:28] praise the Lord healed Jose it's the
[1:28:31] same God even not a different God it's
[1:28:33] the same God it's the Lord Jesus
[1:28:45] I remember Jose well the first time that
[1:28:47] I met that he showed me all those and
[1:28:48] I'm like okay I can see that I can see a
[1:28:50] lot better now it does especially the
[1:28:53] line the line you can see that really
[1:28:54] plainly that's really striking you know
[1:28:56] how Christ is the lion in Christ is the
[1:28:59] Lamb Christ is the eagle he's all the
[1:29:01] same praise the Lord he's in all and
[1:29:03] through all a men he's all in all praise
[1:29:06] God let's just think that is what will
[1:29:08] be dismissed here I he it's already 5:30
[1:29:11] Eva Lord willing brother if God has you
[1:29:13] come back we'd love to hear the
[1:29:15] testimony of the Lord be willing but you
