[15:39] encouraging we had a an accident on our
[15:42] little farm and uh we had a my son and
[15:46] my wife was trying to hook up the
[15:48] finishing mower that we pulled behind
[15:50] our our big tractor if anyone's familiar
[15:53] with the finishing mower it's a it's a
[15:55] five foot wide finishing mower it's
[15:56] pretty big and uh they're hooking it up
[16:00] trying to get hooked up and they uh
[16:02] sometimes when you hook them up you got
[16:03] to bump the PTO so it spins the PTO
[16:07] shaft so you can get the tracker shaft
[16:10] and the and the Implement shaft lined up
[16:13] because they're splines and they go on
[16:14] engaging in each other So Lisa was down
[16:18] there trying to get it on Elijah's up on
[16:19] the tractor she said go ahead and bump
[16:20] it and they went and bumped it know
[16:22] apparently a cat was under there under
[16:24] the mower they didn't know it so it had
[16:28] spun
[16:29] it engaged the the blades and went
[16:31] turned on and hit the cat and threw it
[16:33] out the out the uh ejected it out the
[16:36] finishing
[16:39] low you know they shot out there and it
[16:41] was like seemed like it was almost dead
[16:45] so they quickly prayed for the thing and
[16:47] it's going fine
[16:49] now yeah she called me up and said this
[16:52] cat's dead we hit it accidentally I
[16:54] think it's going to die you know was
[16:55] like all curled up you know it it
[16:57] defecated everything all the signs that
[16:59] it was going to die
[17:01] and uh so I said you know did you pray
[17:04] for it they said yeah we prayed for it
[17:07] right away so that was a good thing to
[17:10] do now the cat's doing fine healing up
[17:12] fine I you
[17:15] know God grace right
[17:23] amen a little kitten too
[17:26] so didn't have much a chance against
[17:29] that mower I'll tell you that but God
[17:31] does
[17:33] amen God all things are possible so
[17:35] let's with that take that encouragement
[17:38] to our Lord in prayer he cares about the
[17:41] kittens on a farm he certainly cares
[17:43] about his sons and
[17:46] daughters so let's go before him in
[17:48] reverence here Lord
[17:51] Jesus we thank you Lord God for this
[17:53] time of prayer this time of gathering
[17:55] Lord God how we're reminded that life is
[17:58] sacred Lord how even the example on my
[18:00] little farm here where a cat was Lord
[18:03] struck by the blades of a
[18:06] mower where that cat had no chance Lord
[18:09] but father you know how we value life
[18:11] and we know you value life Lord God we
[18:14] know that
[18:15] father when that tragedy happened that
[18:17] cat was hit and ejected out Lord the
[18:20] first things on our mind was prayer and
[18:22] going to our God because you're more
[18:23] than able we didn't know what to do Lord
[18:26] we couldn't really do anything for the
[18:28] cat Lord whatever internal injuries it
[18:30] sustained and Lord God whatever broken
[18:33] bones it might have had Lord God no
[18:35] matter what the cases you came on the
[18:37] scene and you were the Great position of
[18:40] that cat Lord so we thank you Lord
[18:44] Jesus and how we're reminded Lord by
[18:46] this example to Value life and to bring
[18:49] all life before you and to let you be
[18:51] our Lord and savior and King Lord for
[18:54] you can govern and rule over all things
[18:56] even the very laws of physics Lord the
[18:58] laws that Set This World In Motion you
[19:00] govern over those Lord and when they're
[19:02] contrary to your
[19:03] will you override them
[19:06] Lord thank you Lord Jesus so for all
[19:09] these requests Lord God where we come
[19:11] against for the natural laws that are
[19:13] against us here Lord God whether it be
[19:16] in our health or body or mind Lord
[19:18] father you can override these things
[19:20] Lord the tragedies and the health
[19:22] problems the Mind battles Lord God the
[19:24] psychological problems and issues Lord

[33:55] you know to me and such a wonderful F
[33:57] kind of like a mentor to me you know and
[33:59] a real a real servant uh been a real
[34:03] friend to me all the way back since 2008
[34:05] when we met and uh I was just thinking
[34:08] the other day how it's been too long
[34:09] since we seen
[34:11] him and uh uh just been such a real
[34:15] strength to me you know there so many
[34:17] times you can ask my wife how many times
[34:19] I've talked about how brother Jim just
[34:20] been such a a friend that I needed you
[34:22] know many many times so I really thank
[34:24] God for that and I've been able to ask
[34:26] over years of asked many questions that
[34:28] a pastor might asked you know different
[34:30] doctrinal things you know and always had
[34:32] wonderful faithful counsel from him and
[34:35] I thank God for that but there's one
[34:37] thing about brother Jim you know he's
[34:39] got he's got Eternal fruit in our little
[34:41] assembly I think back in 2009 when he
[34:43] preached at our garage back there in
[34:46] North akaran on Mo
[34:48] Drive uh he preached that message about
[34:50] sighing and crying for the
[34:53] Abominations and uh my sister-in-law
[34:55] sister Beth came up for pray prayer
[34:57] afterwards and was weeping and her tears
[34:59] were hitting the concrete floor we
[35:01] didn't have carpet you know and she was
[35:03] weeping s crying for her sister Barb and
[35:05] two years later Barb got saved and she

[39:17] word
[39:25] GL
[39:34] [Applause]
[39:39] I was amazed when I was sitting in the
[39:43] back room there I heard brother John
[39:44] start to sing some songs uh been a long
[39:48] time since I've been here and heard
[39:49] brother John lead song was was a
[39:51] blessing sitting back there but uh he
[39:54] had no idea what I want to speak of this
[39:56] morning but God
[39:58] did and and that always amazes me you
[40:02] know and uh sometimes people come to our
[40:04] church and they'll Minister the word of
[40:05] God and somebody will come up to me and
[40:07] say did you talk to him before he came I
[40:09] said no I think the Holy Ghost was
[40:11] talking
[40:12] amen and sometimes I'll preach maybe
[40:15] some of the same messages I preached
[40:16] just the week before or something like
[40:18] that it's just amazing but brother John
[40:20] Sang a a song back there he said thank
[40:22] God I am free free
[40:25] free
[40:26] and I thought to myself brother John
[40:28] didn't know I I wanted to speak on being
[40:30] free this
[40:33] morning so he had to sing a song I was
[40:36] gonna sing a song when I come up here
[40:37] because uh sometimes that helps me not
[40:39] feel quite as nervous I was gonna think
[40:42] I'm so glad that Jesus Set Me Free but I
[40:44] thought well brother John's already
[40:45] singing about being glad he set free I
[40:48] guess I won't have to but amen sometimes
[40:51] amen we we don't really appreciate the
[40:53] fact that we are
[40:55] free appreciate the freedom that God has
[40:58] given us in him and uh some sometimes
[41:00] that's a that's a terrible tragedy that
[41:02] we just let that freedom amen go
[41:05] unappreciated I don't want that to
[41:07] happen this morning so I want to
[41:08] minister word if I could have been
[41:10] preaching a series at home at the home
[41:12] Church on being more than a conqueror
[41:15] amen amen if you have your Bibles I'd
[41:16] like to read that scripture just to get
[41:18] started amen and maybe uh that's not the
[41:21] scripture I want to preach on but to get
[41:23] an idea I've been preaching this series
[41:24] of being more than a conqueror and um in
[41:27] this series uh it's more than a conquer
[41:30] by uh by knowing his word and more than
[41:33] a conquer by and different things that
[41:36] makes us more than a conqueror and uh I
[41:39] thought when I preached it the first
[41:40] time I had I did had a little more than
[41:42] I wanted to speak so I went ahead and
[41:43] preached another message number two in
[41:45] that series and I thought that would
[41:46] finish it off I then last uh Wednesday
[41:49] night I preached number 16 and and I
[41:51] don't think there's anything uh there's
[41:53] there's no ending spot in the Conquering
[41:55] power of our Lord Andor Jesus Christ
[41:57] what he's done for us and I was
[42:00] listening to Brother John testify about
[42:02] the prayer in the prayer before your
[42:03] prayer service and and how God is able
[42:06] and he's he's concerned about every
[42:08] little thing amen yes and he's more than
[42:10] able to cure and to heal and to deliver
[42:13] and I want to peek on that this morning
[42:14] if I can if you have your bibl turn with
[42:16] to Romans the 8th chapter I'm sure we're
[42:17] all familiar with the scripture but I
[42:19] would like to just go over it amen it
[42:22] said Romans
[42:23] 8:35 Romans 8:35
[42:27] good to see yall again to see brother
[42:29] bang haven't seen him I see some faces I
[42:31] recognize and some faces that I don't
[42:33] recognize
[42:36] but I'm sure some of you don't know me
[42:38] know who I am but that's all right God
[42:40] knows who I
[42:42] am that's the one I'm really concerned
[42:44] about yes sir I always love to meet new
[42:46] people make new friends and I pray
[42:48] something I'll be said this morning
[42:50] it'll be a blessing to you brother Jesse
[42:52] said he gets counsel for me I think it's
[42:53] really the other way around amen I never
[42:55] met a young man like brother Jesse uh
[42:58] who has such a grip on this message and
[43:01] uh every time I listen to him every time
[43:03] he comes and preaches for us I learned
[43:05] something and I said wow that's
[43:07] something I wish I I wish I had know
[43:09] that I wish I could have said that or I
[43:10] wish i' have thought of that and uh you
[43:13] know brother Jesse's a teacher I think
[43:15] we all know he he teaches in the natural
[43:17] but I believe he's more of a teacher in
[43:19] the spiritual than anything I've learned
[43:22] quite a bit from Jesse and from his
[43:24] ministry and I appreciate him so much
[43:26] and uh you are very fortunate that God
[43:28] sent you a man like that Amen to Pastor
[43:30] your church and uh he's always been a
[43:33] blessing in my life and I thank you for
[43:34] the opportunity to be here with you this
[43:36] morning amen so if you have your Bibles
[43:38] this morning read real quick Romans 8:35
[43:41] it says who shall separate us from the
[43:42] love of Christ shall tribulation how
[43:45] many have had some tribulation maybe me
[43:47] shall distress none of us are having any
[43:49] stress D persecution famine nakedness
[43:53] pearl sword as is written for last sake
[43:55] we are killed all the day long and we
[43:58] are counted as sheep for the slaughter
[43:59] they in all these things Paul says we
[44:02] are more than a conqueror amen now it
[44:05] means something to be a conqueror amen
[44:07] but that's the guy who goes out and he
[44:09] wins the battle that's the Conqueror but
[44:11] the Bible says here that we are more
[44:14] than a conqueror what's it mean to be
[44:16] more than a conqueror I don't have time
[44:18] to preach that message I won't get to
[44:20] the one I want to preach this morning
[44:21] but I preached that when we had his
[44:23] first thought but you know the Conqueror
[44:25] is the one that conquer
[44:26] amen and wins the battle and wins you
[44:28] the victory amen we know that one did
[44:30] that for us amen his name is Christ
[44:33] Jesus we know he did that for us 2,000
[44:35] years ago but then he made us more than
[44:38] a conqueror amen he made us possessors
[44:41] of what he had conquered possessors of
[44:43] what he had already went ahead and
[44:45] purchased for us so he said we're more
[44:47] than conquerors and I am persuaded Paul
[44:50] says that neither death nor life nor
[44:52] angels no principalities no powers nor
[44:55] things present nor things to come nor
[44:57] height or depth or any other creature
[44:58] shall be able to separate us from the
[45:00] love of God which is in Christ Jesus
[45:03] Paul had a revelation that he could say
[45:06] I am persuaded I know beyond the shadow
[45:09] of a doubt and you know what the problem
[45:11] with the bride of Christ is sometimes we
[45:13] are not
[45:14] persuaded sometimes we don't really know
[45:17] who we are sometimes we don't realize
[45:19] amen we are more than conquerors in him
[45:22] this morning I want to preach on that
[45:25] along that line this morning but uh with
[45:27] that thought in mind I want to preach a
[45:29] message this morning I saw I just said
[45:31] being set more than conquerors by being
[45:33] set
[45:34] free how many are glad you're free this
[45:37] morning thank God I'm free free free
[45:39] from this world of sinl what was it to
[45:42] set me free the Conqueror amen Set Me
[45:45] Free shed his blood on Calvary that I
[45:47] can know Freedom this morning that's
[45:49] something to Rejoice about Hallelujah we
[45:51] ought to be the most rejoicing people I
[45:53] like our brother here that sang the song
[45:55] Amen he got he got something to thank
[45:57] God for amen he's thanking for all these
[45:59] things we all ought to have that Heart
[46:01] of Thanksgiving when we realize what God
[46:03] has done for us we realize amen all the
[46:07] blessings that are ours this morning
[46:09] every Redemptive blessing has already
[46:11] been purchased for us through the blood
[46:12] of Jesus Christ how many say Amen to
[46:14] that so that thought in mind this
[46:17] morning again if you have your Bibles
[46:19] amen uh St John chapter 8 amen the verse
[46:22] I want to speak on Amen it's okay if I
[46:25] take off my
[46:26] coat and I don't I don't work good in a
[46:30] coat
[46:32] and I just plan on doing a little battle
[46:34] with the Enemy this morning so I don't
[46:36] fight C on
[46:38] either so uh if you have your Bible St
[46:41] John chapter 8 verse 31 you love the
[46:44] Lord this morning good to see sister

[46:52] Hannah then it's always good to see home

[47:11] amen amen and Jesus and then said Jesus
[47:15] to the Jews which believed on him I want
[47:17] you to notice who it is Jesus is talking
[47:19] to he's talking to Believers yeah he
[47:21] says if you continue in my word then are
[47:24] you my disciples indeed and you shall

[47:30] you free what is that makes us tree it's
[47:34] knowing the truth how do you know the

[47:42] answered said we be Abraham seed we
[47:44] never were in bondage to any man how
[47:46] sayest thou he shall be made free and
[47:48] Jesus answered them verily very I saying
[47:50] whosoever committeth sin is the servant
[47:52] of sin and the servant abideth not in
[47:53] the house forever but the son abideth
[47:55] amen if the son therefore shall make you
[47:58] free he shall be free indeed amen how
[48:02] many want to be free indeed this morning

[48:06] Heavenly Father we thank you for your

[49:51] last weekend how many knows what last
[49:52] weekend

[49:58] was celebrating the 4th of July I was
[50:01] while everybody was celebrating the 4th
[50:03] of ju I was in my study and I was
[50:04] studying I was getting lost in this
[50:06] thought and I was trying to get myself
[50:08] together for Sunday morning and all of a
[50:10] sudden I heard all this racking like
[50:13] boom bam I thought I thought a bomb went
[50:15] off outside the house and I thought what
[50:17] in the world I jumped up I'm my mind's
[50:20] not even thinking about the 4th of
[50:23] July and my and all of a sudden I up and
[50:25] I head out the door and my wife I said
[50:28] what in the world she said it's
[50:30] fireworks and we lived like two miles
[50:32] from town and you could hear the
[50:33] fireworks like they were in my backyard
[50:35] and it was boom bang boom and I stepped
[50:38] out you know I I stepped out the door
[50:40] and you could see them above the trees
[50:41] it just
[50:42] this and then as I heard the noise fade
[50:45] away and then I heard the I heard this
[50:50] yeah yeah people were screaming I
[50:53] thought what in the world they acted
[50:54] like a bunch of
[50:56] crazy like what in the world is going on
[50:59] but you know what it was amen they were
[51:02] celebrating something that happened like
[51:04] 240 years ago they were out there
[51:07] celebrating the fact that amen they had
[51:10] been set free amen they were under a
[51:13] tradical government if you would amen
[51:15] from from Great Britain or England amen
[51:18] and and there they were they were being
[51:20] they were being held down they were
[51:21] being they were being held under the
[51:23] thumb they were held they were being
[51:25] being treated unfairly they were being
[51:27] oppressed amen and afflicted by a
[51:29] government and I thought to myself
[51:31] that's exactly like the Bride of Jesus
[51:33] Christ was but you know why these people
[51:35] were celebrating they were out there
[51:37] they were shouting they were jumping
[51:39] they were hauling they were clapping
[51:41] their hands amen every time one of those
[51:42] things that go off boom like that they
[51:45] yell a little bit more and get real
[51:47] excited and I thought wow I said if they
[51:51] can get that excited Amy man because 240
[51:55] years years ago ever what it was amen
[51:57] that that some Sons of Liberty shed
[51:59] their blood on this American soil that I
[52:02] might know Freedom amen I thought how
[52:04] much more are we to celebrate the fact
[52:07] that the Son of God come and shed his
[52:09] life's blood and set us free amen 2,000
[52:12] years ago that's something to celebrate
[52:15] about but church not just on a Friday
[52:18] night or a Saturday night or the Fourth
[52:20] of July that it ought to be a
[52:21] celebration in our hearts every day amen
[52:24] amen and I thought to myself why are
[52:27] these people because they know they're
[52:29] set free amen they know that they're
[52:31] free American citizens they know they're
[52:34] sons of this country amen and all the
[52:37] freedom this country affords them is
[52:39] theirs amen amen how many knows that
[52:42] therefore they had their hands in the
[52:44] air they were rejoicing they were eating
[52:46] they was they was partying they was
[52:48] demonstrating anden the great joy that
[52:51] was in him for something that happened
[52:52] 240 years
[52:54] ago amen that really if you start to
[52:57] look at it amen it's not going to be
[52:59] long but that same tyrannical government
[53:01] spirit is start to coming right back in
[53:04] and trying to hold them back down amen
[53:07] oh it might not be Britain amen but it's
[53:09] still a brother BR said it'll be a
[53:11] three-fold cord amen political satanical
[53:14] spiritual power will come in and begin
[53:16] to hold that bride try to hold that
[53:18] bride down amen and if you don't know
[53:21] that you're free you know what it'll

[54:25] he shed his life's Blood on the soil man
[54:28] that I might know Freedom amen sometimes
[54:31] I get out of bed and sometimes I don't
[54:33] even thank him for right right I Just
[54:37] Want to Thank You Lord amen for letting
[54:39] me hear a word and then why because the
[54:42] word he said you're going to know the
[54:43] truth what is the truth the word is
[54:45] truth and he says that the truth will
[54:46] set you
[54:48] free I want to speak on that this
[54:50] morning if I can amen so if you continue
[54:53] in my word then are you my decip IES
[54:55] indeed amen and you shall know the truth
[54:57] if you're going to have to to know the
[54:59] truth you're going to have to continue
[55:00] in the word amen now that word amen
[55:03] continue it's a it's a Greek word I
[55:05] believe it is I don't have it I think
[55:08] it's a Greek word a Greek or Hebrew word
[55:10] amen I I cut that top of the page off
[55:12] when I printed somehow I'm not good at
[55:14] this kind of stuff I don't do this
[55:16] computer stuff too well amen mean that's
[55:19] why my notes are on a piece of paper not
[55:21] an iPad man I'm old school I'm old and
[55:25] of course I don't have to tell you that
[55:26] you can tell by looking amen but he says
[55:29] that word amen to continue means to be
[55:32] held to kept continually to continue to
[55:35] be Amen to survive or to live in I
[55:38] believe it says over I in him we live
[55:40] and move and have our being in it me to
[55:44] continue in the word not just hit it on
[55:46] Sunday not just hit it on Wednesday but
[55:48] that word should ever be in your heart
[55:50] ever left ever before your mind and I
[55:54] like what I read out there sit at the
[55:55] pastor's desk and made a little thing
[55:57] there on front he said before you make
[55:59] any decision before you make any move
[56:01] man you ought to ask God is this what
[56:03] you want that's continuing in the word
[56:05] amen it's going to keep you from being
[56:07] bound by something you don't want to be
[56:09] in Hallelujah says so when you do that
[56:12] he says you're going to know the truth
[56:14] and the truth shall make you free church
[56:17] amen we ought to we ought to be
[56:19] rejoicing as much as those people were
[56:21] in the city of Al the other day because
[56:23] we've been made free the only reason we
[56:25] find out that we're not amen the onlyon
[56:27] we see people that are not we find that
[56:29] we don't always is because maybe we
[56:31] don't really realize that we are
[56:33] actually free right right right you say
[56:36] well wait a second brother Jim I know
[56:37] we've been I know I'm set free and then
[56:39] I know you do it then why don't you act
[56:42] like if I know if I know that I'm free
[56:46] from sin why don't I act like it I know
[56:49] I'm free from sickness why don't I act
[56:51] like that why know I'm free from turmoil
[56:54] and all all this unrest why don't I act
[56:57] like it why do I allow that devil to
[57:00] come here and hold me down sometimes but
[57:03] that purchase possession has already
[57:06] been bought it's already mine it was
[57:09] bought 200 years ago by the son of Goden
[57:13] when he spilled his last blood on Cal he
[57:15] set me free amen how you know that the
[57:18] word says so Hallelujah now I can
[57:21] continue in the word and know that it'll
[57:22] Set Me Free but if I don't continue in
[57:24] that word if I don't stay in that word
[57:27] that word sometimes has a way of getting
[57:30] stale how many know that to be the truth
[57:33] that's why I don't see how people can
[57:35] stay out of church two and three weeks
[57:36] and and not get stale amen it doesn't
[57:39] happen it does guess you didn't tell me
[57:41] to say that amen but church if you if
[57:43] you are here every time the doors are
[57:45] open something's wrong you will get
[57:48] stale you will begin to Wayne Amen that
[57:52] that knowledge of the truth will begin
[57:54] to be a little bit more distance from
[57:57] youbody knows that to me the truth but
[58:00] the Bible says you shall know the truth
[58:02] what's it mean to know the truth what's
[58:05] it mean to know the truth again this is
[58:07] a Greek word it's a I probably won't
[58:09] pronounce it right it's gesco gesco
[58:12] something like that it means to know to
[58:14] understand to perceive or have a
[58:16] knowledge or a revelation of have a
[58:19] revelation of to understand to know amen
[58:24] I like is it said to the Greeks this
[58:26] meant to know facts amen you know we
[58:29] read this amen this scripture amen he
[58:31] says you're going to know the truth and
[58:33] the truth will set you free yes the
[58:35] truth isn't just a bunch of facts the
[58:37] truth is a reality the truth is a life
[58:41] that word is a living word amen it said
[58:44] to know to the Greeks it meant to know
[58:46] facts but these facts may or may not
[58:49] affect one's conduct now we know I know
[58:52] I know beond the sh of up it's a fact
[58:55] that Jesus Christ shed his life's blood
[58:57] to set me free 2,000 years ago but the
[59:00] question is do I really know it or is it
[59:03] like a Greek a heathen do I just have an
[59:05] intellectual conception that he set me
[59:08] free there's a big difference
[59:11] Church it says here to the Greeks have
[59:13] meant to know that those facts may or
[59:15] may not affect one's
[59:17] conduct right right now it may affect my
[59:20] conduct it may make me shout it make me
[59:23] Rejoice but it may make me say oh Lord
[59:25] what am I going to do now oh Lord I just
[59:28] don't know which way to turn oh Lord you
[59:30] know what that is that's because it's
[59:32] not really
[59:34] known just it's not really understood it
[59:37] hasn't become a revelation to you it
[59:41] said that's the way it was to the Greeks
[59:43] but to the Jews the believer the true
[59:44] knowledge always manifested itself in
[59:47] one's
[59:48] conduct this word says ye shall know
[59:51] truly to know not just have an
[59:53] intellectual conception that God Is A
[59:55] Healer you've got to experience that
[59:57] healing you got to know it for yourself
[1:00:01] if you know Salvation am it's because
[1:00:03] you experience salvation you realize
[1:00:06] what it felt like he sent from that Old
[1:00:10] Devil he no longer has you under his th
[1:00:13] there's fireworks going
[1:00:15] off
[1:00:18] hallelujah amen he said oh he said to
[1:00:21] Jew true knowledge always manifest
[1:00:22] himself one conduct he said one did not
[1:00:25] know something to the Jew there's God's
[1:00:28] chosen people he said one did not know
[1:00:30] something until that fact had a
[1:00:32] practical outworking in that person's
[1:00:36] life amen if you're going to know a
[1:00:39] truth that will set you free it's got to
[1:00:41] have a practical outworking in your life
[1:00:45] say Amen to
[1:00:46] that Amen brother B made this statement
[1:00:49] I want to read it here this morning
[1:00:50] found the unconditional Covenant God
[1:00:52] made with the people is it okay to read
[1:00:53] these words yes sir I believe God sent a
[1:00:56] prophet am you know what I was so messed
[1:00:58] up before I got the word of God that a
[1:01:00] prophet sent that I was preaching this
[1:01:01] and I was preaching that but the prophet
[1:01:03] of God come along and it wasn't his
[1:01:05] interpretation it was the spirit of God
[1:01:07] through him that made this word of God
[1:01:10] live so I kind of try to stay close to
[1:01:12] what the prophet said yes sir yes sir
[1:01:14] had a guy tell me one time he said you
[1:01:16] come he said I have issue with something
[1:01:18] that you said this weekend I said okay

[1:01:28] quote boy it got real
[1:01:31] quiet I said no I didn't say that I was
[1:01:33] just reading a quote amen that's what
[1:01:36] the prophet said now if you have an
[1:01:38] issue you don't have an issue with me
[1:01:40] you have an issue with the prophet I got
[1:01:42] my oh that's I'm glad I have it on notes
[1:01:45] I got it said did I say uh did I say I
[1:01:48] found a weak spot of Pentecost and me
[1:01:52] that I didn't say that that day but
[1:01:53] that's what I'm want to say here in a
[1:01:54] minute right right say well brother
[1:01:56] there no weak spot in this message left
[1:01:58] out what the prophet said right right so
[1:02:01] I read sometimes I read from the quotes
[1:02:03] amen it keeps me out of
[1:02:05] trouble not that I can't make a mistake
[1:02:08] and don't amen right right but I pray
[1:02:10] every time I said Lord God guard my lips
[1:02:12] lest I should say something that's
[1:02:13] contrary to the word amen amen you know
[1:02:16] what I believe God ansers prayer yes
[1:02:19] amen I make mistakes and sometimes I
[1:02:21] have to go back and correct them but
[1:02:22] it's not too often you know why because
[1:02:24] God answered prayer I say God guard my
[1:02:26] lips he guards my
[1:02:28] lips I believe God how many believe God
[1:02:31] answered prayer this morning am that's
[1:02:33] the way we all be with everything we do
[1:02:35] Hallelujah he said I found a weak spot
[1:02:37] in the Pentecost amen he says you don't
[1:02:40] know who you areen I could take that and
[1:02:42] not say Pentecost I found a weak spot in
[1:02:44] the message sometimes we don't know who
[1:02:46] we are say Amen to that amen we don't
[1:02:50] know who we are see if you only realize
[1:02:52] the position you have in heaven tonight
[1:02:55] there'd be something take place here
[1:02:57] tonight uhhuh he said uhhuh see see he
[1:03:00] says every I put down every Redemptive
[1:03:03] blessing is already ours amen as a freed
[1:03:06] son they were purchased amen 2,000 years
[1:03:09] ago at Calvary amen and I can say like
[1:03:12] Paul none of these things are going to
[1:03:13] move me I am persuaded amen no matter
[1:03:16] what it is whether it's death or
[1:03:17] persecution or problems or or or or
[1:03:20] turmoil in my life those things amen
[1:03:23] I've already been conquered amen yes
[1:03:26] they are already under the blood they
[1:03:29] have already been overcome by Jesus
[1:03:31] Christ now all I have to do is realize
[1:03:34] that realize that Glory he said here he
[1:03:38] said oh if You' only realize the
[1:03:40] position you have in heaven tonight
[1:03:42] there would be something take place here
[1:03:44] tonight you know what it would be it
[1:03:45] would be
[1:03:46] fireworks it would be shout you said
[1:03:50] well what are you so what are you so
[1:03:51] shouting about I said I know the truth
[1:03:54] and the truth say even though it looks
[1:03:56] like I'm sick even though this situation
[1:03:58] looks real bad and me that situation is
[1:04:01] already overcome I'm set free from
[1:04:04] that no
[1:04:06] power the Bible says he says the Bible
[1:04:09] said now are you the sons of God not
[1:04:12] will be right now how many sons of gods
[1:04:15] of God we have here this morning when
[1:04:17] did you become a son and daughter of God
[1:04:20] you always were amen but there was a
[1:04:23] time when you became placed as that son
[1:04:25] when that adoption took place when you
[1:04:27] were born again that spirit of God come
[1:04:29] down amen and he put that robe of
[1:04:32] adoption Upon Us amen made us sons of
[1:04:34] God and we appear to be doing just
[1:04:36] exactly what he was doing amen I know
[1:04:39] that to be the truth amen he said now
[1:04:42] are you the sons of God not will be
[1:04:44] right now you're the sons of God right
[1:04:46] now you're seated together in Heavenly
[1:04:48] places in Christ Jesus Hallelujah
[1:04:50] somebody say
[1:04:51] amen amen but the problem is we we we
[1:04:54] know that we read it here but we just
[1:04:57] have a head knowledge until it has it
[1:04:58] practical outworking in our lives and
[1:05:00] then we don't really know it he doesn't
[1:05:02] really set us free he says that's the
[1:05:04] problem because you don't realize who
[1:05:06] you what your position is he says he
[1:05:09] said when you can think now instead not
[1:05:11] not sometime far off amen he's quoting
[1:05:14] the scripture he said and it's found
[1:05:16] over here and I get ahead of myself
[1:05:18] sometimes he said beloved now are we the
[1:05:20] sons of God 1 John 3:2 he said it do not
[1:05:23] yet appear what we shall be but we know
[1:05:25] that when he shall appear me how many
[1:05:28] believe he made an appear yes you know
[1:05:30] where I see him tonight I see him
[1:05:32] sitting back there I see him sitting
[1:05:33] here and here and here he made an appear
[1:05:36] he's coming he's taken up his Tabernacle
[1:05:37] himself in people Amen in
[1:05:40] human and what is it it's nothing more
[1:05:42] than a seed Gene of God it was placed
[1:05:45] there from amen it was placed there when
[1:05:47] you were born amen but before the
[1:05:48] foundation of the world and lay in the
[1:05:50] dust of the Earth the prophet God said
[1:05:51] but that seed was a germinated amen when
[1:05:54] that blood came down at
[1:05:56] Calvary say Amen to that but he said one
[1:06:00] day that seed come under the influence
[1:06:02] of that spirit and he said it begin to
[1:06:04] come forth it begin to it begin to it
[1:06:07] begin to live amen yes until that it
[1:06:09] would just a a word seed laying there
[1:06:12] amen that's the way that a lot of this
[1:06:13] word is to us as Believers it's just a
[1:06:15] word seed laying there but all of a
[1:06:17] sudden when it starts to catch and that
[1:06:19] that Spirit begin to Quicken that word
[1:06:21] he said he said what do we see appearing
[1:06:23] we don't see brother Jim appearing we
[1:06:26] see him appear when he shall appear
[1:06:28] we're going to be just like him for we
[1:06:30] shall see him as he is I want to be able
[1:06:33] to see him as he is this morning I don't
[1:06:35] want to see him as he is in Jesse I want
[1:06:37] to see him as he is living right here in
[1:06:39] me right there my wife said oh I found a
[1:06:43] weak spot he said we're sons of God but
[1:06:45] when you think now we are sons of God
[1:06:48] said now we are the sons of God not th
[1:06:49] yet appear we shall be when he shall
[1:06:51] appear we shall be like him he says it's
[1:06:53] not some place off in the future Christ
[1:06:55] Jesus is tabernacled here on Earth now
[1:06:58] amen amen amen showing his great
[1:07:02] manifestation of his Blessing and Power
[1:07:04] Willing that everyone should be saved
[1:07:07] everyone should be healed none should
[1:07:10] have to have you said none should have
[1:07:13] to have a prayer line amen how many say
[1:07:15] Amen to that amen he said oh you
[1:07:17] shouldn't have to have a prayer line he
[1:07:19] says everyone should be saved none
[1:07:22] should perish I tell you if that really
[1:07:24] if you really fathomed that in your mind
[1:07:25] you wouldn't have to pray for the sick
[1:07:27] it would all be over he said because he
[1:07:30] says you have but first for that to take
[1:07:32] place you have to see it first amen you
[1:07:36] have to see it first amen and he said
[1:07:39] now that word see it's not the word like
[1:07:41] you and I look at it's not the word see
[1:07:44] it doesn't mean uh to see something with
[1:07:46] a natural eye necessarily but it means
[1:07:48] to understand amen it's the same thing
[1:07:52] he says do you know the word do you
[1:07:55] understand the word yes had become a
[1:07:57] personal revelation to you amen he says
[1:08:01] oh he says it doesn't mean that you can
[1:08:02] see it it it's certainly it's it's it's
[1:08:05] not that you have to see it with the
[1:08:07] natural eye he said but he said if you
[1:08:10] have to have to see it first and you
[1:08:12] can't see it you certainly can't see it
[1:08:16] or understand it if you can't see it you
[1:08:19] know how the prophet talks back and
[1:08:21] forth he said now the word see doesn't
[1:08:24] mean to look
[1:08:25] at he says the word see doesn't mean
[1:08:28] look the word see means to understand
[1:08:30] that's right like Jesus told Nicodemus
[1:08:33] he said except you be born again you
[1:08:36] can't even see the kingdom of God how
[1:08:38] many knows he said that you know you can
[1:08:41] stand here and and you could try to
[1:08:42] explain to me computers and and all this
[1:08:45] stuff here I keep seeing somebody moving
[1:08:47] over there it's
[1:08:49] me and uh I don't know how that works I
[1:08:53] don't understand understand it and you
[1:08:55] know what I can say but I can see it
[1:08:59] right but Jesse said well let me show
[1:09:00] you how this works and let me tell you
[1:09:01] how this works and he could he could
[1:09:03] stand there and tell me said you push
[1:09:04] this button you push that button and it
[1:09:05] goes in there and your picture comes out
[1:09:07] on that screen I said I don't see it I
[1:09:11] don't see it I can see it but I don't
[1:09:13] understand what he's talking about right
[1:09:15] let me say Amen to that right who knows
[1:09:17] what he's how how many knows what I'm
[1:09:18] talking about yes yes and I just don't
[1:09:21] see what you're I don't understand it in
[1:09:23] other words not that I can't see with my
[1:09:25] natural eyes that's the same thing he
[1:09:26] was telling Nicodemus but Nicodemus
[1:09:28] couldn't understand what he was saying
[1:09:29] he was what brother brand referring to
[1:09:31] as the scripture over here in St John 3
[1:09:33] said there was a man of the Pharisees
[1:09:34] whose name was Nicodemus the ruler of
[1:09:36] the Jews the same came to Jesus by night
[1:09:38] and said unto him Rabbi we know look at
[1:09:41] what he said we know he had a mental
[1:09:43] conception he understood with the mind
[1:09:45] and the natural mind he said we know
[1:09:48] that thou art a teacher hey man come
[1:09:50] from God for no man can do these
[1:09:52] Miracles except God God be with him he
[1:09:54] said I know that yes yes church I know
[1:09:57] that 2,000 years ago I was set free amen
[1:10:01] something to shout about I know that
[1:10:04] 2,000 years ago Not only was I set free
[1:10:06] from sin but I was set free from
[1:10:08] sickness I was set free from sadness I
[1:10:10] was set free from turmoil I was set free
[1:10:13] from all that all that on Calvary and I
[1:10:16] know that but church until that is
[1:10:19] quickened to me I can read Isaiah 53 all
[1:10:23] day long but until that is Quicken to me
[1:10:26] I don't see it I don't understand iten
[1:10:28] I'll go around sick amen I'll go around
[1:10:31] depressed amen I'll go around amen uh uh
[1:10:34] with not knowing which way to go amen
[1:10:37] yes how many knows it's the truth amen
[1:10:39] how many ever been there yes amen and he
[1:10:43] said Jesus he said we know th the
[1:10:44] teacher come from God Amen for no man
[1:10:46] can do these Miracles except God be with
[1:10:48] him and Jesus said in ver say Toto you
[1:10:50] except a man be born again he can't see
[1:10:53] the Kingdom of Heaven amen you can't see
[1:10:56] the kingdom of God excuse me amen so
[1:10:58] what was he telling Nicodemus he said
[1:11:00] not that he couldn't see he said but
[1:11:03] you'll never understand you'll never
[1:11:05] experience that Kingdom that word
[1:11:07] Kingdom there is a word aen it's a Greek
[1:11:09] word I believe it or Hebrew word it's
[1:11:11] called basilia amen and what it means
[1:11:14] amen is it means not to be confused with

[1:22:09] Hallelujah the disciples came to Jesus
[1:22:11] one time you know what to this to to a
[1:22:14] lot of people in this message there's
[1:22:15] just so many parables that we don't
[1:22:18] understand I'm not trying to
[1:22:19] dechristianize anybody and like I said I
[1:22:22] pray Lord if I say something wrong your
[1:22:24] pastor can correct that am and he he's
[1:22:27] got he's such a there's such a way about
[1:22:28] him he can do it and just so smooth
[1:22:31] too that's that's that's that's the gift
[1:22:34] that God placed in his life but church
[1:22:37] amen I'm not here to hurt you but you
[1:22:38] know I wonder sometimes if we really
[1:22:41] understand or the message just a bunch

[1:22:45] disciples the ones who followed Jesus
[1:22:47] Christ amen who followed his word came
[1:22:49] to him one time said why do you speak to
[1:22:50] the people in parables
[1:22:53] you know to the world out there this
[1:22:55] message is nothing more than a bunch of
[1:22:57] Parables something that they don't quite
[1:22:59] understand it's quite there they saying
[1:23:01] I just can't quite see it yes you know
[1:23:04] why that is because the spirit of God
[1:23:05] never quickened it to him right right he
[1:23:07] says you'll never see it until you're
[1:23:09] born again he said thees came unto him
[1:23:12] and he said answer them because it's
[1:23:14] given to you to know the mysteries of
[1:23:18] the kingdom of God he says you shall
[1:23:20] know the truth the word amen the mes
[1:23:23] you're going to know those he said it's
[1:23:24] given to you to know but he said to them
[1:23:26] it's not given right you know church if
[1:23:29] you understand the mysteries of this
[1:23:31] message you ought to get up and shout
[1:23:32] you ought to shout and praise God you
[1:23:34] been set
[1:23:35] free because he says it's not given to
[1:23:38] everybody to know what a privileged
[1:23:41] people we are amen how we ought to thank
[1:23:43] God for what he's given us amen yeah he
[1:23:46] said but he goes on there in the 13th uh
[1:23:48] verse of that 13th chapter wherefore
[1:23:50] speak to therefore I speak to them in
[1:23:51] Parable because they they see see not
[1:23:53] and hearing they hear not neither do
[1:23:55] they understand a lot of people can see
[1:23:57] the message they can quote the message
[1:23:59] they can some people can tie me up in
[1:24:01] knots with quotes amen right they say
[1:24:04] well you say brother BR said this what
[1:24:06] about what he said over here what about
[1:24:07] what he said over here I said we just
[1:24:09] don't quite understand that we need to
[1:24:10] pray for the spirit to make it real to
[1:24:12] us no I think it's a contradiction
[1:24:14] that's you know that's because they
[1:24:16] don't
[1:24:16] know never quickened it to them amen
[1:24:19] amen so what he says but it's given to
[1:24:22] them can see it they can hear it but
[1:24:24] they don't understand it they don't know
[1:24:26] it it doesn't do a thing for them well
[1:24:28] I'm over here rejoicing I've been set
[1:24:30] free by it they don't understand right
[1:24:32] right what a privileged people we are to
[1:24:34] understand amen this is no more than
[1:24:36] fulfillment of Isaiah which said and
[1:24:38] hearing you shall hear and not
[1:24:40] understand and seeing you shall see and
[1:24:42] you'll not perceive there's a lot of
[1:24:44] people that have been gifted or or

[1:25:13] too straight broke my heart yes sir yes
[1:25:16] sir you know what it was it was no more
[1:25:18] than a parable to them the word had
[1:25:21] never been quick

[1:25:38] given to them to see what a blessed
[1:25:40] people we are here this morning see you
[1:25:43] shall see and and they and they don't
[1:25:45] see it amen for there people is wax
[1:25:48] gross their hearts are wax gross their
[1:25:50] ears are full of hearing their eyes are
[1:25:51] closed less than any time they should
[1:25:53] see with their eyes and hear with their
[1:25:54] ears and understand with their heart and
[1:25:57] they should be converted and I should
[1:25:59] heal them he said she said what is it if
[1:26:02] they would do all that then the
[1:26:03] blessings theirs too they'd be set free
[1:26:06] too but he turned right around to those
[1:26:08] disciples and he began to speak to them
[1:26:10] he said but blessed are your
[1:26:12] ears amen how many you thank God for
[1:26:14] having blessed ears this morning mine

[1:26:31] he said they should see said but blessed
[1:26:33] are your eyes for they see and your ears

[1:26:38] many prophets and righteous men have
[1:26:40] desired to see the things which you see
[1:26:42] and have not seen them and to hear the
[1:26:43] things which you hear and have not heard
[1:26:45] them and then he turned around he says
[1:26:46] hear ye therefore the parable of the
[1:26:48] Sword and the seed and the spirit of God
[1:26:51] walking around in flesh begins to
[1:26:53] Quicken that word that he'd been talking
[1:26:55] to everybody else and they didn't
[1:26:57] understand but there was the spirit
[1:26:59] there was there was God himself walking
[1:27:01] in flesh and he turned to his disciples
[1:27:04] and he began to explain to them that
[1:27:06] Parable he began to make it known to
[1:27:08] them and they said oh we see it they
[1:27:12] didn't see it with their eyes they
[1:27:13] understood it they knew what the word
[1:27:15] was saying and that word set him
[1:27:18] free how many believes that tonight it's
[1:27:21] it's not just church amen it's not just
[1:27:24] seeing this message amen a lot of people
[1:27:26] see it and they just use it for reasons
[1:27:28] to argue and debate and to fuss with
[1:27:30] amen church that's not what it's for
[1:27:32] it's here to set us free it's here that
[1:27:34] we might rejoice and thank God for the
[1:27:37] day and hour which we live and that
[1:27:38] God's allowed us to see this Worden and
[1:27:41] when we see this amen we see people
[1:27:43] doing this it just shows to me that they
[1:27:45] don't quite understand what that word is
[1:27:47] about yes they haven't quite seen it
[1:27:50] they've seen it with their eyes you know
[1:27:51] what we need to do for people like that
[1:27:53] we need to pray Lord God Quicken that
[1:27:55] word to them let that Spirit make that
[1:27:58] word real to them because there's a lot
[1:27:59] of people in this message that have a
[1:28:00] great understanding of message but it
[1:28:02] never made them
[1:28:04] free what good does that do it makes you
[1:28:06] more miserable than you were right right
[1:28:08] brother right Amen brother BR told it
[1:28:11] like this I want to share this story and
[1:28:13] many of you have heard it I'm sure he
[1:28:14] told about an old sea captain on the
[1:28:17] se he said he pretty near lived his
[1:28:19] whole life out in sin and unbelief amen
[1:28:22] he was held Bound by the devil his whole
[1:28:24] life he never knew what it was like to
[1:28:26] be free but one time he' heard about God
[1:28:29] he'd heard about the Bible he' heard
[1:28:31] that there was a God who could save but
[1:28:33] you know what it had never become
[1:28:35] Quicken to he'd never really see it just
[1:28:39] like a lot of people in the message amen
[1:28:41] they've heard about this message they've
[1:28:43] heard about this word but it's never
[1:28:44] become real to them and therefore
[1:28:46] they're still under Bond that's why they
[1:28:48] can't shout that's why there's no
[1:28:50] fireworks in their life that's why
[1:28:51] they're not selling celebrate because
[1:28:52] it's just a mental Conception Church
[1:28:55] when you get that Revelation I'm here to
[1:28:58] tell you amen oh do you have it all the
[1:28:59] time brother Jim know but when the

[1:36:12] needed to find tune but yet he testifies
[1:36:15] in the Book of Job have you considered
[1:36:16] my servant job there's none like him

[1:36:33] the message of the hour I believe he's

[1:42:51] you're sitting in here this morning the
[1:42:53] devil has you bound amen you the only
[1:42:55] reason he can hold you bound is because

[1:42:59] yes if you're being troubled be do what
[1:43:02] you need to pray for go God brother

[1:43:05] every day more than anything else is
[1:43:06] revelation more than anything else so
[1:43:09] that comes from the Holy Spirit making
[1:43:11] the word of God quick than the word of
[1:43:12] God to you amen problem is we go around
[1:43:16] already set free and we don't know it
[1:43:17] and that's why we act the way we do yes
[1:43:20] sir told a little story about a crow I
[1:43:23] wish he'd told it about an eagle but he
[1:43:25] told it about a crow he said a farmer
[1:43:26] one time was in a field he said and this
[1:43:29] Crow come by and was always picking his
[1:43:31] corner so he said you know what he did
[1:43:32] he set a trap and he caught that old
[1:43:33] crow and he tied him and he bound him by
[1:43:36] the leg amen he said I'll set him out
[1:43:39] here and I'll scare the rest of the
[1:43:41] crows away because they'll see him bound
[1:43:44] they say I want to get bound so I'm
[1:43:45] staying away from that good food I'm
[1:43:48] staying away from there so here this
[1:43:50] bird that was born to fly with bounds
[1:43:53] here on the ground going around and
[1:43:55] around in circles tied to a
[1:43:57] peg many knows the story yes well

[1:44:07] time to get out of here death is
[1:44:08] creeping in but we got to get out of
[1:44:10] here we're going to die and old Johnny
[1:44:12] Crow says I can't I'm bound I can't I'm
[1:44:15] bound and you just go around and around
[1:44:17] in circles you know that's way a lot of
[1:44:19] people are in the messes keep going
[1:44:20] around around Circle the devil hasn't
[1:44:23] bound amen unbelief of his word the
[1:44:26] devil hasn't bound because they can't
[1:44:28] see that he's already set him free amen
[1:44:30] the word of God is already settled the
[1:44:32] Redemption plan is already made amen but
[1:44:35] we just have to accept it he said yes he
[1:44:37] said and what it was he says but one
[1:44:39] time he said but then one day that Crow
[1:44:41] would try to call and he said he could
[1:44:43] not he was tied him in so one day he
[1:44:45] said there came a good kindhearted poor
[1:44:48] man to come by and he said and there was
[1:44:50] that old poor old crow tied down there
[1:44:53] and he says he said I felt so sorry for
[1:44:55] him and I thought to myself that's the
[1:44:57] same thing that happened to me one day I
[1:44:59] was sitting and he says and he sent his
[1:45:01] Lord the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[1:45:03] come down and he said you know poor
[1:45:05] brother Jim I feel so bad that he's down
[1:45:07] there he don't belong there he's
[1:45:08] supposed to be sword he's an eagle amen
[1:45:11] he don't belong bound and tied down here
[1:45:14] and so he come along and he cut that
[1:45:16] Bond loose that had that the devil had
[1:45:18] be held with he cut that Bond unbelief
[1:45:21] he cut that Bond of of not being able to
[1:45:24] see amen he cut the blindfold off of my
[1:45:26] spiritual eyes amen and the spirit of
[1:45:28] God come down and reveal the word of God
[1:45:31] to me and by his blood I was saved there
[1:45:33] on Calvary I was set free
[1:45:37] amen and then I was sitting there and I
[1:45:40] was still under depression amen and
[1:45:42] still still all all tied down and and
[1:45:45] people come by and say rejoice brother J
[1:45:47] you're free he said no I'm still I'm
[1:45:49] still here
[1:45:52] but I was free all the time yes you know
[1:45:54] what I always was free yes I never was
[1:45:58] bound yes but they just had me tricked
[1:46:00] through unbelief to thinking that I was
[1:46:02] bound and he had a lot of people in the
[1:46:04] message tricked into thinking that
[1:46:05] they're bound when they're already set
[1:46:08] free so what is it he saids he said what
[1:46:11] was it he said oh this poor HED guy I
[1:46:13] feel sorry for him he goes over he cuts
[1:46:15] the B he lets a crow grow and they cried

[1:46:33] amen you need a revelation of the holy
[1:46:36] spirit that that thing is already under
[1:46:38] the blood that thing's already taken
[1:46:40] care of it's already been
[1:46:42] purchased yes he said that's the way
[1:46:45] many people are tonight he said the lady
[1:46:47] whoever it was was sitting here in that
[1:46:49] wheelchair they heard the good news last
[1:46:52] night he said tonight those wheelchairs
[1:46:53] aren't here he says why is that he says
[1:46:57] they were probably sitting out there in
[1:46:58] the audience he says see they were free
[1:47:01] all the time he said Jesus cut them
[1:47:03] loose at Calvary when the bloodstream
[1:47:05] came from his body and to free every
[1:47:07] person from their sicknesses they were
[1:47:09] set free 2,000 years ago he says and so
[1:47:12] were you he says the only reason we stay
[1:47:15] there because they just didn't know it
[1:47:17] he said they didn't know the truth the
[1:47:20] word that would set him free they didn't
[1:47:22] have a spiritual understanding why was
[1:47:24] that because they didn't continue in the
[1:47:26] word just continue in that word brother
[1:47:29] says you get a vision of you're sick you
[1:47:31] get a vision of a well man and just keep

[1:48:16] accepted Christ as their savior was
[1:48:17] sitting here bound last night by sin and
[1:48:19] unbelief he says he said but Satan come
[1:48:21] along and cut that chain of sin and
[1:48:23] tonight they're enjoying freedom of the
[1:48:25] Lord after they've heard that
[1:48:27] Emancipation Proclamation was signed

[1:49:04] the symptoms brother BR said one message
[1:49:06] he said any man that ever looks at the
[1:49:08] symptom loses his victory every time how
[1:49:11] many say Amen to that amen but every man
[1:49:13] that looks to the word of God is set

[1:50:09] would come or whatever amen I'm going to
[1:50:11] sing this or U read this word before we
[1:50:14] sing a little song Here said during the
[1:50:16] time of slavery when that
[1:50:19] Iman Proclamation was signed how many
[1:50:22] back in January 1st of 1863 or 53
[1:50:25] brother Jesse knows he's a school
[1:50:27] teacher probably I don't know amen but
[1:50:29] way back then amen Lincoln signed a
[1:50:32] letter of intent Amen to set the slaves
[1:50:34] free and a mancipation proclamation but
[1:50:37] brother BR they tell me the slaves in
[1:50:39] the South would climb to the hill that
[1:50:41] they were going to be because they knew
[1:50:42] they were going to be free at the
[1:50:44] sunrise on that date amen according to
[1:50:46] this
[1:50:48] Proclamation he says for as soon as they
[1:50:50] seen the sun they knew they were
[1:50:54] free how many are glad that you've seen
[1:50:56] the sun this
[1:50:58] morning Satan held us like slaves bound
[1:51:01] amen under his thumb amen under sickness
[1:51:04] and depression and all these things he
[1:51:06] said but guess what he said the word of
[1:51:07] God said I am set free but that has I've
[1:51:10] got to see that I've got to understand
[1:51:12] that I've got to be quick and to I got
[1:51:14] to be like John courts now I see it amen
[1:51:17] and the Lightning's got to flash job
[1:51:18] said now I see it amen and now I
[1:51:22] understand it in other words now I'm
[1:51:23] born again now that word's been
[1:51:25] quickened by the spirit of God in my
[1:51:27] life and now it's become a
[1:51:28] revelation he said every man that sees
[1:51:31] the son is free yes know you might read
[1:51:34] brother man where did he get this you
[1:51:36] got it right here a joh you shall know
[1:51:39] the truth you shall see that son and he
[1:51:41] say be set free every man that sees the
[1:51:43] sun is free you see the son you see him
[1:51:46] in a way of Revelation that God has
[1:51:48] revealed him to you that's the only way
[1:51:51] you'll ever know it he says when God has
[1:51:54] revealed it to you that's the basis of
[1:51:57] all scriptural promise he says when God
[1:52:00] reveals it to you that's the only way
[1:52:02] you'll ever know yes but he tells Simon
[1:52:05] one time he says he says Flesh and Blood
[1:52:07] hasn't revealed this to you it's not
[1:52:09] some teacher it's not some man it's not
[1:52:11] reading of a book or listening to a tape
[1:52:13] he said all that's good he said that's
[1:52:15] continue word he said but it takes the
[1:52:17] spirit to come down and Quicken that
[1:52:19] word really know that that word is real
[1:52:22] amen that's what John Court he heard the
[1:52:24] Bible he knew that there was a God that
[1:52:26] healed but it never become a reality to
[1:52:29] him amen it has to be a personal
[1:52:31] revelation to you church and when this
[1:52:33] word becomes a personal revelation to
[1:52:35] you that devil Can't Hold You bound
[1:52:38] anymore you talk about a Fourth of July
[1:52:41] celebration you talk about fireworks
[1:52:43] that's the way it ought to be in our
[1:52:44] lives every day why why can't I feel
[1:52:47] that brother Jim you might need the
[1:52:48] spirit of God more than you've ever
[1:52:50] needed it before this morning amen he
[1:52:53] said oh he says flesh and blood has not
[1:52:55] revealed this you but my father's in
[1:52:56] heaven upon that rock that Revelation
[1:52:59] that's where the church is built amen
[1:53:01] that's where we're set free he said when
[1:53:04] you are built upon that rock spiritual
[1:53:06] revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:53:07] that's where we bu the church that's
[1:53:09] where we know we are free how many say
[1:53:13] there want to be how many want to know
[1:53:14] that this morning put you stand praise
[1:53:16] God amen amen this word of God is true
[1:53:19] and are more than conquer through him I
[1:53:21] am persuaded that none of these things
[1:53:24] that the devil can bring no longer have
[1:53:26] an effect on me they no longer can have
[1:53:29] an effect on you the reason they do is
[1:53:32] because you need a quickening of that
[1:53:34] word god you need to stay in that word

[1:54:05] something to shout about then you'll
[1:54:07] have a reason to celebrate the freedom
[1:54:09] we have because then you'll know the
[1:54:11] truth and the truth will set you free

[1:54:28] Spirit upon that word to Quicken that
[1:54:30] word to my life that I can be set free
[1:54:33] I'm tired of that devil trying to hold
[1:54:35] me down I'm tired of only rejoicing in
[1:54:38] the natural things I want to rejoice in
[1:54:40] the fact that by his stripes I've been
[1:54:42] set free just look your hand say pray
[1:54:44] for me brother Jim I need a fresh
[1:54:45] anointing for that Holy Spirit upon that

[1:54:53] Hallelujah he says you can see it all
[1:54:56] day long you can read it all day long
