========================================

I'm going to start First Corinthians tonight and I still got to finish the other one I got to finish the coming of the lord The Rapture mystery so I just kind of felt inspired at you know I finished Sunday night at the communion service with 1 Corinthians 10 and so then I was studying on 1 Corinthians and I read through about I think 11 or 12 chapters and so I thought well I'm going to start preaching this here tonight by God's grace so let's go to 1 Corinthians 1 chapter 1 uh verses 1 two and three 1 Corinthians 1 verses 1 two and three we'll start with this here by God's grace all right

Sanctified in Christ Jesus called to be Saints with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord both theirs and ours Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from

Souls Lord this is a a letter you inspired Lord Paul to write for the benefits of saints for the last 2,000 years so father just break the meaning Lord God give us understanding Lord Grace wisdom Revelation lord god let's get in the spirit of Revelation Lord God that you might be glorified Lord these uh book series have been such a help to me as your Prophet did it as well you taught through entire books of the Bible Lord God that the people might be grounded Lord and he said have their Roots deep in the ground Lord God so we want Our Roots deep in the love of Jesus Christ rooted and grounded in Christ Paul says in the book of the Ephesians Lord God so that's our desire tonight Lord God bless your people with Thy word Lord feed your people tonight in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated Hallelujah so I have some uh slides here and we'll try to present uh the beginning of the the book here by God's grace did everybody see the self-driving cars yet did everybody see that this week okay virtue saw it good virtue Hallelujah yeah I watched another video on yesterday I went to elon's uh X website and saw some videos and pretty amazing uh but uh yeah he said end of 2026 early 2027 but usually they're a couple years off so uh we'll see how the Lord leads uh but really inspiring so we're looking at uh the first uh Corinthians here part one you read our text and remember my purpose in doing this is Brother BR went beyond the curtain of time and uh the voice said Jesus will come someday and he'll come to you first and you'll be judged remember the Bible said judgment begins at the house of God hallelujah these are people are your converts that you've LED I said you mean by being a leader he'll judge me yes does every leader have to be judged like that yes I said what about Paul he'll be have to be judged with his well I said if his group goes in so will mine cuz I preach exactly the same word that's it I said where he baptized in jesus' name I did too and millions screamed out all at once were resting on that hallelujah how many resting on the same word hallelujah amen I love I love we can read you know Acts 19 and Paul baptized him in the name of the Lord Jesus Hallelujah and Paul said you'll be uh he'll be judged by Christ we'll all be judged by the word that he gave him and I thought my if I'd only knew this before I come here I would make I would make people come here they can't afford to miss this why look at here and the Bible said in that day God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to Paul's gospel Hallelujah uh so resting on Paul's gospel we need to know what he said in all his letters for he wrote the whole counsel of God and brother Ram told us and souls that are in prison that's got to come for it's thus sayith the Lord Malachi the 4th chapter just before the coming of the great and terrible day of the Lord I'll send you Elijah kind of backgrounding here what will he do turn the hearts of the children back to the doctrine of the fathers back to the Bible out of these denominational difference and come back to the Bible back to God that's what he would do notice what a great time we're living how many living in a great time Hallelujah remember Church brother Ram preached entire books of the Bible and he probably he would have done it a lot more if he would have been a pastor his entire Ministry but of course he was a prophet the holy spirit said do the work of an evangelist and he was a pastor of course for a short period of time uh by God's grace but he preached the entire Book of Job he said the book of Hebrews and the Book of Revelation right so here in 1955 he said uh he preached about a year and a half to get through the Book of Job and he had job on the ash Heap for six or eight weeks I've never done that to you right I've never uh stayed on one verse for eight weeks have I one verse said six or eight weeks now he's probably exaggerating he often would admit he exaggerated but he spent a lot of time just on being on ash Heep Hallelujah and then the woman would ask brother when are you ever going to get Joba off the ash Heep right so so sisters will come up dear brother brandom when you ever going to preach something different now thankfully no one's ever done that to me I try to move on from one thing to the other right I try to I try to keep moving with fresh thoughts but it was ordained and brother R had a good uh he had a good repentance and altar call when he finally got job off the ash sheep but anyways look at that a year and a half right a year and a half and then from August uh to September 57 he preached 10 sermons on Hebrews 1-7 he never finished that uh but he talked about it here and then uh he said um he said we used to have great classes we'd run them maybe a series of subjects for a complete year start in the book of Genesis and tie the Bible together start in the book of Exodus run it Daniel and maybe the Book of Revelation just take the entire book from place to place okay so brother Braham had a desire to do this he said at the Tabernacle he would do that when he was a pastor before 47 when he he left the Tabernacle and went to take his gift to all the nations Hallelujah then in 195 6 he said uh The Book of Revelations he said I taken once almost a year and a half to go through it slowly each night teaching on just the Book of Revelation and comparing it with the rest of the Bible and the ages and so forth that have been passed on so I hope I hope uh if you would have lived in brother Ram's time you would enjoyed a year and a half on the Book of Revelations Hallelujah would you enjoyed the Book of Job for a year and a half Hallelujah a whole year and a half really yeah you could definitely do it by God's grace and so you know through that inspiration of course me just w I I wanted to preach what Paul preached right because that's what we're resting on so so me doing that I preach through these in yellow and so I'm going to start this one now and hopefully you know just hopefully I'll maybe just go straight down here now I felt really compelled to go up to Romans after Colossians and I think God Vindicated that that was a great blessing going through that series um and I started back in 2016 looking at uh Galatians I only preached five parts on that then 24 on Ephesians 17 on Philippians 10 on Colossians and 30 one on Romans just you know how longwinded preachers are you know they just keep going longer and longer all the time now on the timeline of Paul's Ministry now in Corinthians it says around 54 to 57 ad so about 10 years before Paul passed away uh while he was in Ephesus he had a three-year stay in Ephesus that's the longest we know that he ever stayed somewhere and he said I taught you the whole counsil of God in three years but it was during that time he probably wrote to the city of Corinth um just so you have a kind of an idea that was his third missionary journey okay now some some people like as I showed you before there's different timelines we don't have like a certain date on a letter you know Paul wrote this we don't even have any dates so uh they're just doing their best you know here here again they say about about the same timeline 56 55 54 you know Paul wrote Corinthians from Ephesus so a lot of scholars believe on this just so you have an idea of uh when he wrote his books you know the scholars believe he wrote Galatians first ver and then Thessalonians Corinthians this would have been his you know third or fourth letter here uh by the grace of God of course we know second Timothy was his last letter now uh the city of uh Corinth during Paul's life was quite a place um it was uh I'm just going to read off of some history here it was a significant cultural religious and commercial hub in the Roman Empire now here's Paul's last trip remember to Rome I showed you this when he went to Rome to die well Corinth is right there okay so it's modern day Greece uh I think this is turkey modern day and of course Italy um so Paul of course would have wrote to here now they said he wrote while he was here which would have been a nice short way to a short trip to get the letter there that would have been a short travel right uh in Paul's day but you know it's an important you know it's right by the Sea right Corinth is pretty close to the Sea and so it's a very important uh uh Hub we'd say for the Roman Empire it was a Cosmopolitan City there was a lot of trade that happened in Corinth uh because it was near the water it had uh religious pluralism now I'm reading some big words here from history okay so pluralism means lots of religions okay and it had Pagan worship they had a variety of Gods like Aphrodite Apollo and posidon this is according to historians here and this is apparent because Paul had to deal with all the idol worship and the meats that were sacrifice to Idol he had to tell them you know we're Believers we know you know we know this meat didn't come from an idol he said but don't eat eat it uh if there's a weak Christian around but he says if no one's around he said you can eat it because it's not going to bother you you know it doesn't come from these Gods but it was a something they had to deal with right all the idolatry uh and then Pagan feast and so forth it was a place now here's a really interesting thought a place of moral decadence which means moral uh wickedness it had a reputation for wickedness Indulgence particularly in sexual immorality drunkenness and general excess the word uh there's a Greek word uh it's called Uh coren I can't even pronounce it but it's a it means to act like a Corinthian and it was a slang term meaning to engage in SE sexual morality so they had a certain word that they would use oh you're acting like a Corinthian kind of like you're a hippie remember the well we weren't alive but uh you know you ever heard about the hippies you know hippies were known to be into drugs right sexual morality so long hair on the guys and uh sex clothes on the girls right so some people say oh the older generation say you're acting like a hippie well that was kind of like a negative thing to say right it was all evil well that's what this this word Corinthia I'll just say it like that they had a word oh you're just a Corinthian or today you heard me say I'll say like they're just a heathen right like that's kind of what they they the Corinthians were so wicked they had a name about them that was just uh negative this was a very evil place to live live right and we can see this must have been a young church cuz as we read the book they had a lot of trouble right and this slang term was oh you're acting like a gri kind like you're acting like a heathen you're acting like a a a hippie or something like that we know today what's a negative okay what's a more negative word like uh like for uh woke yeah you're acting woke that's evil word that's an evil group uh I'm not sure any other words anybody know any other words sodomite yeah yeah you're act like sodomite very good thank you very good so they had their own slang terms it was seen as a city of loose morals and this is why Paul had to emphasize sexual Purity so many times and live against the culture and then of course it was economic and social stratification just like all the other letters uh right like the Book of James now James was writing to chist or to to to Christian Jews all over turkey and so forth for uh but remember remember in 1 Corinthians 11 there were people getting drunk at the Lord's table because they had so much money see church that's why I told you be encouraged nobody got drunk when we were here on Sunday I say we're a mature Church you might might not feel like that but you are if you really look at your life compare it to the book of Corinthians compare it to the Ephesians you're a mature Christian by God's grace now we all want more of God but thank God we don't have drunkards at Communion as far as I know I'm going to get to this a little later far as I know in our church we've never had any sex sexual immorality as far as I know God has been gracious to us a lot of mess churches have we haven't I consider that God's grace on our lives Hallelujah and the remember the wealthier members of the church were uh they wouldn't let the poor eat or eat when they had their communion Feast on the night they'd take communion they would say oh no you're not rich enough uh Haven you're not rich enough you you can't eat with us think about that they outside the church they' have all this food and they would keep people out no you're not rich enough you're you're not good enough to be uh to come eat with us before communion time church we have such a loving Church Hallelujah we have we have such loving hearts here right when when did you ever see me forbid anybody to take communion brother emailed me about that last week communion brother R said Is An Open communion he said anyone who's confessing faith in Christ can have communion that's what he said Hallelujah and yet some people will they'll go to some extremes and oh no unless you've been baptized the Lord Jesus Christ which that's the way to be baptized but they'll in other words they'll keep denominational people out I have a quote brother R says let the Baptist take it let the Presbyterian let the Lutheran if you want the quote see me after service I'll get it for you because I emailed it to the brother brother baham said we don't he said there's one place where we all have something in common that's at the cross of Jesus hallelujah amen and and then there was a lot of philosophy uh because of the wealthy people and because uh it was in Greece right you had the leftover wisdom of the stoics and sofism right stoicism and sofism so had all these uh they were all influenced by uh the these eloquent men not like me I'm not eloquent I stutter I spit I forget things I I make a fool of myself every week but these but the Corinthians were used to these great orators the such wonderful speakers and Paul had to battle against that he said it's not with the wisdom of words but it's in the power of the Holy Ghost Amen in other words power of the Holy Ghost not to get drunk power of the Holy Ghost to live sexually pure Hallelujah that's the power of God Amen Hallelujah but this is what they had to deal with and then divisions and factionism right we'll get to that later in uh chapter uh one I believe it is I'm not mistaken they get right into it and then they had they were just overboard on spiritual gifts just overboard on Sensations that's what brother Ram labors the most when he preaches one sermon on the book of Corinthians he preaches one sermon April 14th 57 he preached one sermon on the book of Corinthians of course he mentions it all throughout his ministry but that was the point he was making he said so many people are so focused on a sensation or a feeling that they're missing the real he calls it the anchor of the Gospel I'll let you guess what the anchor of the gospel is for a few minutes then I'll show I'll share it with you and I'll give you a clue it's in 1 Corinthians 13 anybody know the anchor now children what's the anchor Jesus but what about Jesus 1 Corinthians 13 it's the chapter about keep think okay keep thinking hold it right there then then you'll you'll get at the end yeah look it up in your Bible do some work there yeah he spent some time on uh gifts and and so we here we have a we have a good kind of background into the The church here now this is of course modern map I think it's modern I I typed in map modern so we have turkey we have Greece and then Italy just so you can see and here's of course Israel so remember Paul made that trip but just an idea there's Corinth really small there just to have an idea I I church I don't I don't travel around the world I need to go back and look at maps all the time I can't remember where places are I just I can't I can't do it I'm not a world Traveler now brother R preached only one sermon on the book of Corinthians he called a Sunday school he was actually he actually said I'm going to preach 15 minutes guess how many minutes he preached 69 he said sorry I just went a little over the minutes uh while the kids were coming out of Sunday school so he was only supposed to preach to Sunday school before brother Neville preached and he said I'll do 15 minutes and he did an hour and 10 minutes but that's our Prophet right there that's my brother right there so if you want to listen to it it's a tremendous message I mean I when I I've listened to it three or four times uh the last few weeks and there's so many good quotes that come out of here so uh it's right before it's right after Easter right and then it was heading into Revival services so he preached this to get them ready for Revival and he says I'm just preaching a Sunday school so if you haven't listened to that you'll be really blessed again it's not too long you I mean you'll be able to remember a lot of it by God's grace okay I forgot to set my Tim but let me do half an hour from here I'm I'm I'm not trying to preach too long Sunday really wore me out I had to song Lead and preach and I was just worn out by the end so uh I'm going to try to get some rest here tonight by God's grace so I love as you know I love CI Scofield's Bible it's been my Bible since 2009 and uh I like his outlines now I read word I reword these a little bit to make them fit on the screen okay so I I just so you know if you go look in your Scopia Bible they'll be slightly reworded but the same divisions I got the same divisions so tonight we're just looking at the the introduction the believer standing in Grace and then uh it goes through the carnal state of the Corinthians then he rebukes immorality especially sexual I should have put sexual immorality um and then he looks at the sanctity of the body the human body and the sanctity of marriage and then he looks at Christian Liberties and looks at headship that's the hair right and the Lord's Supper we preached that on Sunday and spiritual gifts and charity uh then he ends with resurrections he says every man in their own order see God has an order to the resurrections now children what what's the secret what's the anchor love let's all it St together ready love love is the anchor for the Christian it's not the dream it's not a prophecy it's not a feeling it's not a crying it's not tears brother man said it's not shouting or jumping he said love is your anchor Hallelujah now he saids we need all those things he said we we love all those things but your anchor what's going to hold you in your darkest hour knowing the love of God he says the love of Christ brother says that and then he gives closing instructions and greetings in chapter 16 now Scofield's theme instead of typing this out I just I just did a screenshot okay so the writer is the Apostle Paul his relation to the church at cor is set forth in Acts 18 so probably next or Sunday we'll probably preach on that acts 18 to look at the origin of the church it's a supernatural origin uh I always believe our our church started with a supernatural origin too by God's grace I believe that by the grace of God hallelujah uh yeah cuz I mean the the way the way the message got here was Simon up on bookto Avenue uh basically tied me down till I listen to the serpent seat amen so that's how this church started with the Ser sermon serpent seat on bookle Avenue in 2001 uh now the day is around 59 ad it's at the close of Paul's three-year residence in Ephesus the theme is Christian conduct in other words uh Behavior Christian Behavior even the tremendous revelation of the truth concerning Resurrection is made be upon that theme so other words scoffield saying even the idea about resurrections proves we should live holy right now that we know about the resurrections let's make sure our Behavior honors Christ see so no matter how many experiences people have no matter how many miracles you have you got to live right Hallelujah that's right he says the occasion of the epistle was a letter of inquiry from Corinth concerning marriage and the use of meats offered to Idols okay so that was the real reason of it they had questions about marriage and about Meats offered to Idols but the apostle was much more exercised by reports of the deepening divisions and increasing contentions of the church and of a case of incest in which had not been judged that was the man sleeping with his stepmom the factions were not due to heresies but due to the carnality of the Restless Corinthians and to their Greek admiration of wisdom and eloquence the abomination of human leadership in the things of God is here rebuked minor disorders were due to vanity yielding to a childish Delight in tongues and the sign gifts rather than to sober instruction Paul defends his apostleship because it involved the authority of the doctrine revealed through him origin analysis of Corinthians is not possible okay then he just gives the outline that's the outline where I got mine okay now Simon preached months ago it's been a while now um do I have the picture do anybody remember when Simon uh where is it where is it oh there remember when Simon gave a he can kind of gave an illustration like this remember that on his PowerPoint he showed uh there's seven Gentile letters that Paul wrote so Corinth uh Rome Thessalonian colassi Philippi Ephesus and galatia while while he let left that up there I was scratching down this as fast as I could so that's my really fast Chicken Scratch there so because a pent cost and the book of Acts uh it brought seven letters here uh so this kind of inspired me to look at this and then it reminded me that uh these churches battled leav every Church battles leev so that's what I want to look at tonight just a little briefly here the leev of the churches now my reference is Kevin oconor he was a Pentecostal preacher I don't know if he's passed on yet if he's still alive he's very old uh brother Brooks gave me a book years ago when I first started preaching he gave me this book called The Feast of Israel it's a phenomenal book uh and I always thank brother Brooks for giving me that book it really grounded me in a lot of Bible teachings of course brother BR taught all them as well but Kevin oconor was Pentecostal had a lot of agreement with brother brandom now I didn't have time to write all these but I could easily show them to you I'll probably preach a whole sermon on this but the Bible gives lots of different kinds of Leaven now leaven is unconfessed sin that's growing right and Lydia and I were talking and we remember we talked about the story arc uh Lydia said that's Lydia said that's very related to the statement brother Brandon made you can never stay the same you're either rising or falling in your life so I hope today if you felt like you're Fallen I hope this service makes you rise I'm not talking about leev Rising I'm talking about unle Rising by God's grace I'm not even sure if that's possible no it's not okay thank you H always looked at my better half right there for any any wisdom so we got to rise spiritually Hallelujah but Jesus or yeah uh Jesus said Herod had leav and it was worldliness and sensuality remember he obeyed a lot of what John the Baptist said but he had both lives like we looked at on Sunday like remember like those Assyrians on Sunday or the uh uh the Samaritans on Sunday they feared God a little bit but they also worshiped their Idols that's what Herod did Herod honored John the Baptist right he even went to hear him preach but then he also liked dancing girls right he liked dancing young girls but yet he honored the prophet of God see that's 11 that was confess sin in his life and what it lead to he stopped hearing the prophet's voice right and if people don't cut off their sexual sin it's going to help it's going to make them stop listening to brother random right or the fivefold ministry today all right uh next Jesus talked about the leav of the Pharisees and the Sadducees the leev of the Sadducees Jesus said was false Doctrine the leev of the Pharisees was hypocrisy so saying something you do but you don't do it right I think this one is probably something we battle as just all of us as Believers right we all brother R said because we know the message we have way more responsibility but we always don't live up to our responsibilities and brother brand will say we're a million miles below our privileges but church not always are we a million miles below our P privileges right but sometimes we are because we're struggling we got some l in our lives all it takes is a little prayer meeting amen that's all it takes Hallelujah and we can get back to our privileges Hallelujah I believe it with all my heart amen hallelujah it takes the repentance and the spirit of God and so that's 11 the Jesus says that plainly hypocrisy is leaven now the leaven in Corinth was probably sexual morality we see that in chapter 5 but also carnality just carnal you know they wanted to feel something they wanted to speak in tongues so much and prophesy so much uh where Paul had to limitate just three guys just three so how many were going on you know and how many of them were just general oh the Lord's coming soon well we all believe the Lord's coming soon but said we all know he's coming soon we don't need a prophecy to tell us that right a I'm talking about a general prophecy now we preached through gal their Le their legalism was their Leon remember they were trying to bring back in you got to be circumcised to be saved and Paul said how who has Bewitched you you started in the spirit and now you're going back to the law who's Bewitched you he said we need to have another prayer meeting to make sure you're born again hallelujah amen now Ephesus didn't seem to have any problems but Paul told him you know walk in the spirit in chapter four uh neither get place to the devil he helped him on marriage you know in chapter 5 but he doesn't really ball anything specifically out colassi they battle mysticism in Chapter 2 he said don't give into Angel worship remember that and he said don't give into will worship so worshiping according to your will instead of God's will so those are things the Colossians battled in Philippi they battled division remember Paul called out two women remember Paul called them out two women in the last chapter he called them out for all their division all their arguing and fighting Paul had to call them out high-tempered women right I'm sure Corinth had a lot of high-tempered men for sure but remember they also battled anxiety in Philippians so he said I've learned no matter what state I'm in to be content he had to share that with him remember they were a poor church he talked about it later in second Corinthians that the Philippians sent relief to Paul when other churches didn't and yet they were a poor church so they battled sometimes do we have enough can we trust God oh we're going through fearful times and the church said we're going through strange times and the church said just strange times but they uh they were helped by Paul's letter now Thessalonians were really something they battled laziness Paul said they were busy bodies going from house to house and that's where he said if you don't work you shouldn't eat remember that if you don't provide for your own you're worse than an Infidel you didn't have that in other churches right that was kind of there in thessalonica and then he said they gossiped so uh he had to kind of rebuke him on that he said going from house to house and everything like that all right now I'm going to share a little bit about this I was hoping my wife would be in here good timing Darter um you I'm not going to say the name but I just I'll share you know because I was a deacon at the first message church that I was in I was a preacher for a few years and I sat on many of meetings you know dealing with people I should say many but few said maybe five or 10 not many but and so I knew about some of the Le in in in the church that I was in as a as a as a message preacher in in the first church I was in greed was an issue so so uh the pastor wasn't getting all the ties because of the leadership the leadership was keeping some of the money back and that made it harder on the pastor now I wasn't I wasn't the pastor there but most of you know who the pastor was um but I knew about that and there's nothing I could do because really in the side of the state the trustees are the leaders so the trustees controlled it the trustees were breaking the word of God Pastor should get all the ties unless he elects not to like I'm not going to name names but we know we've had pastors preach for us and their ties are so big they don't want to pay taxes on all those so they just get a small portion of those okay I'm not going to call names but this brother says he likes to listen to my sermons after he preaches on Wednesday night so if that pastor's listen send me a text brother love you brother he's a good man he's oh he's one of the finest one of the finest guys in SHO leather you probably know who I'm talking about also uh I sat in numerous meetings about this worldliness was a big part of the home church people were having TVs now everybody's almost got a TV but is it a problem that's the question mine's not Hallelujah I honor God by God's grace am I perfect no nobody is right but it doesn't hurt my walk with God hallelujah uh there was people watching movies especially the young people were watching movies they were sneaking over to other people's houses staying overnight watching movies while the parents were away some of the parents even let their oh I I should have put dating in here yeah some of the message children were let their children doing dating and laying down and sleeping on couches dating that's fornication as far as I'm concerned I couldn't believe it and I was like remember I told you I thought I was amongst Angels like what I I had really fiery Zeal brother Austin kind of not as much as I do now I had a lot more Zeal back then so I was really stirred up you know I was I'd preach pretty hard I'd preach till I couldn't talk I'd clap till I'd bleed on my hands but you know over time God kind of tones you down a little bit and a little more patient more kind um and you know I was in meetings where the pastor would ask us to preach against well not preach against but tell the sisters please don't wear the high heels please don't wear the tight dresses I had to preach on that a couple of times but normally it was another preacher who was well reses in the church I was just a young preacher you know I didn't have as much respect as the other brothers um and of course dating yes and then there was competition now this was shared with me afterwards now this has all been made right so th it was it I was amongst the ministry there but I was only there on Sunday because I liveed three hours away you know I'd only come on Sunday but I wasn't there on Wednesdays but Wednesdays there was competition you know amongst some other other preachers uh they would try to and and this is something they've confessed to me and they've they've forgiven each other and it's all made right again so that's why I know I can share this but they would try to preach deeper messages than the other and uh and was kind of like a competition but God has straightened that out and now all is well by God's grace right and so there was competition well um I got more amens than you did or how about this one I got more people at the altar than you did in a message church now remember other message churches in Corinthians had sleeping around they' argue well I go I go I went to Apollo's church now I got baptized by Peter I got baptized by Paul I got baptized by brother bradam and Paul's like what does that matter he said men are we're all just the same it's God who gives the increase amen Paul's like I'm glad I only baptized one of you like one of your families because you would have said I baptized you in my name these I mean what what I'm saying is message people can be carnal and the church said amen but see if we're born again we should be more mature praise God which I believe we are Hallelujah I hope this is an encouraging message here tonight am right because I I've tried to tell you for years I believe we're a mature Church yes we want more signs Miracles and wonders who does it praise God but we can't tell God God uh now it's time to do some Miracles God I'm going to take you out of my pocket now you need to do something no I'm I'm God's pen right God's going to take me out when he wants to use me praise God Hallelujah like brother R said dream me a dream brother Austin write me a song brother Austin now write me a song now he's not going to be able to do it right you know neither could I when I give a testimony cast out a devil brother Jesse I can't until somebody comes in here who has a devil who wants to be free from it because each time church when I've done it I've had to ask them do you want to be free and some of them some of them were just staring straight ahead and said yes I want to be free and that's when I plead the blood over this daughter usually it's a daughter but it was a Man Too this daughter of God lord uh your blood covers this she wants to be free let I I I said Satan I come against you with the blood of Jesus Christ that's when she go to fighting and screaming or something like that one time she bit my AR one of the woman bit my arm but didn't draw blood by God's grace so uh you know every church has leav so you know we've had leev at bride of ch's Fellowship right over the years so here's some examples you know brother uh just recently brother Griffin said he felt some uh he said he felt the Lord told him some of us had left our first love that's Le right and remember what is the first love it's a fervent desire to please him it's a passion to know his word and a reaching out in the spirit so at some point I mean lots of people were up here but you know could have been something else might not have been something like that but he said felt like the Lord told him to say that when he was out in the woods one day Hallelujah brother McBride come in here fasted and prayed all weekend and said he felt led to preach on the spirit of a tail Bearer gossip and slander now this is kind of like Corinth right the spirit of resentment jealousy and self-recognition that's what brother McBride said I went back and listened to it over the last few months I've listened to him again again and brother bod in the evening service remember the morning he preached that good Hebrews message remember that that was all that was glorious son I was I was in Heavenly places I'm I'm eating at the king's table I told him that too and I told you this I said I always told brother Ben I told him this I said brother you're one of my favorite preachers I said but don't let it go to your head I just told him that and I won't tell that to brother McBride because I I kind of slipped and told Brother B I didn't mean to so I had to say brother don't take don't let it go to your head you know because they're just so humble they just yield to the Holy Spirit and so many times over the years B the rod and God has us use each one of these men just to discern situations in my life and other people's lives it's been so wonderful see it but in the evening he preached staying in your position in the body of Christ right staying in your position he felt led and so with my observations and like I I shared a few weeks ago you know over these years 18 years as a pastor the main Spirits I battled is carnality and critical Spirits that's what I battled like people that have left or accused me of things uh that's what I felt like but like I said we're not battling sexual sin thank God for that now let's keep it that way and the church said amen let's keep it that way you're body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah especially you young ladies and young men coming up your body is the Temple of Jesus Christ Hallelujah you keep it pure amen Jesus died to purchase that Temple amen it's not your body it's God's body Hallelujah keep it pure by God's grace Hallelujah you know and a few years ago I had a a preacher who left now even when he was here I invited him to preach he turned it down and uh after I preached that interracial me message interracial sermon message back in 2015 he's like oh you're going to turn into a believe the sign person and I said no I'm not I said I just believe all the all I just balanced these quotes from brother brandom out and I said you're the and he wouldn't even come talk to me face to face after after all we did for him and all these things wouldn't even say come say goodbye to my face it just and then he went and repeated that with o numerous other churches the same disrespect so I saw it's a pattern of disrespect it's an evil spirit I I I got quotes and I still stand here I stand to be corrected I'm waiting for somebody to correct me Hallelujah because it's God's revelation Hallelujah God always had interracial marriages down through the Bible when God ordains it it's led by God then God's pleased with it Hallelujah people just don't understand they just don't understand things and then of course you know I've been accused on things like with how I handle the finances and things like that you know it's a good thing brother brandom and the Bible say the pastor is the highest Authority in the local church it's a good thing Hallelujah because the pastor labors the most with the people stays with the people the preacher get the the Evangelist gets to leave I get when I when I get invited I get to go in there they haven't heard me preach for years and man I preach the house down because they're excited to see me they haven't heard me for a while they're under expectation there's a reason brother man and the Bible say the pastor has he said supreme authority in the local church you need two or three witnesses that will publicly say the pastor sin brother BR said it's like brother Neville he said if you want to get brother Neville out you need two or three Witnesses saying I saw him getting drunk in public and you got to have proof you have to have more proof than what you'd have at the at the actual courtroom in a civil case to remove a real pastor of God hallelujah that's how serious it is and people have criticized me about things like that and don't and then now like I told you one time and then later once somebody left they got they went to another Pastor said the same thing to the pastor and then that person came back and apologized to me because they didn't know they hadn't been the message very long and didn't know and yet they criticize me right so see uh it's just this critical spirit so you know we don't battle drunkenness thank God I've never seen any of you drunk only in the Holy Ghost Hallelujah by God's grace let's keep it that way Hallelujah right but think about all the things we could battle but we got to battle something I got to battle something Hallelujah you got to battle something amen but no matter what we battle we're more than conquerors in Christ Jesus Hallelujah I'm going to only be 10 minutes longer can you believe that okay now what's the solution to 11 well we know the purging now let's go to 1 Corinthians 5 I'm not even going to start chapter 1 because I wanted to do this background kind of what I felt led to preach on 1 Corinthians chapter 5 uh verse 7 1 Corinthians 5:7 I don't have it up here so I'm sorry you just got to read out your Bible be good to you turn the Bible I love you know I love preaching these uh out of these Bible sermons here these books because it applies directly to our church we can look at our church I love it it's like a mirror right we can like the Bible said look in the mirror of the word and see where do I fit in here how is this like my life how many like that by God's grace I love that I love seeing wow Corinthians struggle with this but we don't struggle with that or wow uh well they did have some divisions they did have some carnality well we battle with that sometimes I mean we're all human right I love it I love it it's like looking into the mirror and I see oh yeah I see myself in God's word I'm a Child of God we are real church we are a book of Acts Church Hallelujah there's a latter of rain to come but thank God for the rain we've received Hallelujah and church I say this you can always have more rain when you want more Hallelujah brother B said the the congregation and the pastor we both control the service if people want to hear from God they got to pull on the gift I've got to youi and myself and we can all benefit from the spirit of God hallelujah it it's it's up to you and I we it's both of us we have to work together if we want a refreshing from the times of the Lord hallelujah refreshing from the presence of the Lord hallelujah I'm willing to get in the spirit if you are Hallelujah I know I'm going to pay for it tomorrow though Hallelujah but that's okay with me I'll just suffer with it you know as always verse seven Purge out therefore the old leaven that you may be a new lump as you are unleavened for even Christ Our Passover sacrificed for us so how do we get the leaven back I'm sorry how do we get the leavon out you got to purge it out just like you'd clean out your kitchen right you get all I'm gonna get all the leaven or I'm GNA get out all the a Sourdough I'm goingon to get out whatever it is you know I'm gonna get all that out of out the kitchen you got to just wipe right you got to sit down wipe it get your uh get your cloth wipe it down get it out same thing in the spiritual if we got sin in our life let's take the uh the rag of the Holy spear right and wipe it off the Waters of the spear Wash It Away let's wash it away under the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah Purge it out get it out in this case he's talking about get that man who's committing sexual sin don't let him come to church right that's what it's talking about here don't let him come to church give him over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh because he keeps doing sexual sin and he's puff he's proud about it and not and not humiliated by it anyone that's prideful over sexual sin Paul said give them over to Satan now no now Church you know he had to have follow Jesus's three-step Command right so somebody would have went to him said you need to confess your sexual sin no way and then then he would have brought somebody else you need to confess your sexual sin stop it no way right and so this would have been the third step right Paul wouldn't break Jesus's commands Hallelujah so see they went face to face they went one to one and then they went two to one and then they presented the church and and so Paul hears about it he said kick that guy out of the church let the de let him give him over to the devil and watch what the devil will do to somebody you ever seen that watch what the devil would do I tell you there's been I don't know why it is there's so many people at Cam's church and I hope it's okay that I say this there's so many people I and I've been a part of it to help them or baptize them or there's so many people we've seen come in and they've forsaken the message that Cam and Simon were preaching I'm talking about the Bible not just our own human thoughts you we all have our own human opinions on things but the Bible and some of them have gone to jail some of them I mean I mean really they've been giv over to Satan because they have uh I don't even think cam put them out from under the blood but it's they're leaving the protection of God's word giving themselves over into Satan's hands they've left the protection and they've been been snared by Satan and I've seen just awful things but what can you do all you can do is warn them they heard it church as soon as we're here we're responsible for it praise God hallelujah that's why I appreciate our church amen you hear the word of God you obey it Hallelujah might wrestle with it for a few weeks but you're going to get it Hallelujah me too I mean I don't receive everything perfectly all right away you know I'm I'm human too I have a time and season where God gives me victories and overcoming but that's how you purge it out verse eight therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with a leaven of malice so see when someone comes to church and they've got anger malice against people and wickedness and sin he said that's insincerity that's it that's coming to church insincere when you're upset with someone or you have sinned unconfessed in your life that's not sincere worship and then Jesus can't help you because you got to Worship in spirit and in truth so this guy was coming to church he was insincere he probably walking there he' probably laughing and joking too much uh and everybody knew oh he's been sleeping with he's been sleeping around everybody knew about it and the Bible said the church knew and they didn't mourn about it so people in the church knew this guy was a dirty dude say like that he's a dirt he's a Corinthian Corinthian I I'll just say it like that he was just like the others but he was coming to church all right uh but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth so he wasn't sincere in his worship and he wasn't living the truth he was living in sexual morality so see if we want leevan out of our Lives we got to be sincere right we got to be more sincere and we got to obey the truth truth that's why I love what the angel told Brother B you must be more sincere remember to bind the mamba snake he said you got to be more sincere to bind him right more sincere that means no playing around no joking right no no messing around if you will get down to business with God God will get down to business with you Hallelujah and me too that's what I'm talking about each one of us so that's how we get the Le now that's the solution to all of our leaven and I tell you each time I've been attacked you know that's what it goes back to it goes back to that uh you know like even with the brother that the preachers that left and everything like that you know uh it always forces me to pray right and be sincere yes I lose a little bit of Sleepover but what it does it brings back the sincerity right any anyone been through any difficult trials lately what does it do it shakes you up right it makes you get your sincerity back what is that doing it's getting the leav out of your life aren't you glad God gets a Le out of your life aren't you glad God doesn't let us grow into some type of an immoral Church a disgrace did you hear about that message Church what a disgrace and they they just they love it they enjoy oh God help us to love Holiness Hallelujah help us to be the Oddball church or the strict church or whatever whatever people want to say praise God just keep our lives pure keep our lives holy like Jesus is Holy like I told a brother from South Africa a good brother boy I found a real connection with him he he said the Lord told me to email you and ask this question he said and thank you for the answer the question was uh the question was uh people in South Africa were telling him oh you can't send out two by two brother Ram said you only got to go out one at a time and he's like brother Jesse what do you think about that I said I said first of all brother Rams never said thus say the Lord with any of that second of all the Holy Ghost sent Paul and Barnabas two by two and that was after Pentecost Hallelujah that was the church ages and I said either Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever or not and he said he was saying the reason he did that cu because he got more results he got more people saved when he had two people rather than one person so I said brother the proof is in the pudding and then he text me back right away this morning email back and said I know the Lord told me I I knew the Lord told me to email you thank you that Set Me Free and he said what about when you're shun by all the he said all the popular preachers in South America or South Africa I said join the group I said I don't even care what they say now I've been more sympathetic to them I've been watching them as far as the goat preachers I really believe they're born again they just got some pride because if they don't have all the sin the sexual sin like the Corinthian Church if they're not getting drunk at the Lord's table they're probably born again so I've been a little more gentle with them now at first I was like man this is crazy how can they say they're the greatest of all time but God has a way of humbling people we just got to make sure we don't exalt ourselves right we just got to make sure brother Austin I got the moat out of my eye first before I go looking at somebody else's eye so I've been a little more gracious I've been listen of course I listen to all most of their sermons not all but listen to a lot of their sermons so I'm trying to close I told you I'd be closing in a few minutes here Glory so the solution to leaven boils down to charity good job girls had to look that one up that's good you only to look it up one time Hallelujah six times as I've listened to uh brother R numerous times now preached this sermon from 1957 he uses the word anchor so if you listen to it he's all talking about how the the Corinthians love to speak in tongues they love to prophesy uh they love Miracles they loved all these feelings they loveed being associated with this bigname preacher the bigname preacher there they love getting drunk at the Lord's table you know there was all about senses and emotions and feelings and brother Ram says six times he said you got to have an anchor he said a lot of these people weren't anchored that's why they could commit sexual sin that's why they could argue about the greatest preachers right they weren't anchored that's why they could get drunk at the Lord's table right but said he said and we need to learn that we need to Anchor in our lives that's what we need an anchor so when the winds are blowing that's kind been talking about the double-mindedness right when the winds are blowing you can throw an anchor down and said I'm not going to be moved Satan's not going to move me from where I'm standing Hallelujah am I'm going to be solid in the word of God hallelujah so let's read through these quotes and I'll finish up here I thought it might be done by eight but I don't think so now brother R said they depended too much on little Sensations little things like that well praise the Lord I had a revelation come to me I had a Psalm I had a prophecy Paul said all these things will fail see every one of them now look at this quote they're not just to be trusted too much isn't that something you would think if you had a dream or you had a vision or you had a prophecy you think oh I can lay my soul on that well brother says take take some take some advice from the Corinthian Church here just be real careful right like remember I told Austin he got that nice testimony the guy said your voice will go worldwide but remember I said be real careful with that right because you he may find out later something about this guy well he already falsely prophesied there you know you never know I've had different people like even when Brother Ray told me that word of the Lord I had I said okay let me go test it brother I would not have received it unless it passed the test right but even that he says see just don't trust in those too much so we need the gifts we we we love the gifts but don't put too much don't overemphasize the gifts because now he's talking about these Corinthians right Paul said all these will fail see every one of them they're just not to be trusted too much but but what he's trying to get here to the church was that anchor where we have an anchor in Christ and we don't trust upon Sensations we don't trust upon Revelations we don't trust on these things only We Trust Christ it's by faith that we move out there Hallelujah now he's talking about like maybe a false Revelation here right because any Revelation I just preach on Revelations brother Irving just preached on Revelation the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against a revelation Hallelujah see what we're saying but anything that's questionable like if if it's a questionable Revelation or if it's just a feeling right if it's just you just had a good emot or just had some emotion you can't really fully trust in that uh if it goes against the word of God you don't trust it at all right we notice Paul Could Teach the Ephesians there how before the foundation World they were predestined on the adoption of the sons of God the Corinthians didn't know anything about that now look they didn't know nothing about before the foundation of world all they knew was gifts feelings and preachers and eloquence and drunkenness you know and these are things they knew about they didn't know I was chosen before the foundation world that that means I should live a higher life if God chose me I come from the mind of Christ I better live like Christ they had to have they had to have a little feeling or something a little sensation right one this way other and they depended on that he couldn't teach them the Deep things so I think it's a great thing when you got a people you can teach deep things and brother Jesse said amen hallelujah I've teach I've taught it as deep as I know it Hallelujah and some of you have ask me questions deeper than I know girls Right girls I don't know some of the answers to your deep questions but God knows Hallelujah and the Holy Spirit can wind these truths and anchor in the people's hearts so they know where they're standing where are you standing I'm standing in Christ Hallelujah I'm not standing in myself I'm not standing in my knowledge or my ability to study the Bible I'm standing in the blood of Jesus and the spirit of God hallelujah standing in that I thank God for every blessing every gift every feeling every emotion I thank God for it but my stance is in the word of God my stance is in the Holy Spirit Hallelujah sensation or no sensation prophecy or no prophecy whatever it might be I remember I was discouraged as a young preacher I was out there in the vegetable we're out there in the vegetable at my home church and a sister Karen sister Karen uh Sanders said thus sayi the Lord and would prophesied over young preacher and I was I was honestly sad she prophesied over him and she said thus say the Lord you'll travel to many places to preach this message and I was kind of sad I don't know if I told my wife that but I was like I wish somebody would prophesy about me when am I going to get a prophecy I don't feel bad anymore because that brother done left the message goes to baptist church now and then he didn't even know he texted Simon he didn't even know how to defeat uh the argument tongues are the evidence of the Holy Ghost I'm like he was in a message church for 20 years and he don't know how to defeat that by the Bible that proves he was never into the Bible he was into popularity or money or something else like that but I was always discouraged sister Lena how come I never got a prophecy and brother said prophecy or no prophecy be anchored in Christ hallelujah amen hallelujah God's already given me enough indications well I probably got some indications right after that because remember I prayed and fasted God just speak through me when the first time I preach in Lima God filled the altar twice the first two sermons everyone's at the the altar weeping and crying getting victories so that was God's Vindication to me he's Vindicated of course many other times see but whether you get a feeling or prophecy or whatever it may be you must be anchored the word of God must be anchored in your heart and all these Sensations those Corinthians had not one of them was the evidence they were saved not one of them is the evidence that they were saved not if you could shout not if you could prophesy not if you could heal the sick if you could speak with tongues if you could interpret tongues if you had wisdom if you had knowledge none of those mean you're saved not one of them you could have every one of them Paul said in 1 Corinthians 13 and be lost I'm nothing but when you got love you got the anchor Hallelujah glory to God Amen Hallelujah I love to shout with all them I love to dance with the best of them Hallelujah sometimes I wish I could just do some more dancing sometimes amen girls I'm still waiting on your songs to dance Hallelujah we'll take out this row we'll dance and I like I said I dance almost every every week at bible Club I love to dance and praise God but that doesn't prove I'm saved what proves I'm saved is there's love in my soul Hallelujah that's the only thing and brother labors on this six times you need the every all of us need the anchor of God's love Hallelujah am and years later now he's talking about after his first wife and Sharon Rose died he was so discouraged Mr Eiser walks up the road he knows he's a preacher he says Billy what does Christ mean to you now you've lost your wife and you've lost your daughter what does he mean now what a test what a test you've been to two funerals do you love Christ now or not your sweet beautiful young bride she's in the grave my father was gone my brother was gone my wife was gone my baby was gone I said what does he mean I said Mr Eiser he means more than life to me just freshly left a funeral something has happened within me glory amen glory so no matter what happens outside of you you can overcome it as as long as you've got somebody inside of you Hallelujah Glory no matter what happens on the outside as long as I've got Christ in me he's the hope of Glory Hallelujah he's the hope that I'll go to heaven hallelujah it's just become more than I am myself Glory hallelujah amen we look at ourselves we we have nothing of ourselves anything good that comes out of our Lives must be Jesus hallelujah amen it's just something that happened it wasn't because I was religious it's just something that God through the grace of God did for me and I thought though he would slay me I trust him just the same and I I said this on Sunday remember and if I was in hell and there was such a thing as love in hell I'd still love him how could there be love in hell but he said I don't know he said but if I was there I'd still love Jesus in the Flames that's all it's something in here he's right it's something in here now how how many can I want to hear some amens after this I deserve every punishment that I ever got amen you and I do the same but it's that anchor that something that anchor of love of God that holds in the human heart other things become secondary the love of God is the primary thing in our lives nothing is greater than the love of God right we're going to with that in just a moment but brother it's a lot more than intellectuals remember I was using Claude as my example remember uh brother B said oh he said people would would plead with young people at the altar oh your dad's de dead in Heaven don't you want to be with him you need to get saved and work on their intellects and their emotions to try to get them to get saved brother said you're not getting them saved they have to love Jesus Christ themselves Hallelujah you don't get saved to get something you get saved to get forgiven Hallelujah he said it's a genuine birth not just a mental conception or emotional work but a birth an experience something that goes Plumb down deep into your heart and changes the innermost being that makes you do the things you would not have done in other words it makes you love those who are unlovable it makes you act different than you ever thought you would act and when situations arise it's your anchor you don't have to wonder will I make it oh no it isn't whether I'll make it it's already made for me will I make it but said it's already made Hallelujah I love that quote Christ in me has made it himself so I don't I don't have to make it because the Maker's already inside of me Hallelujah I don't have to make it he already made it for me and he's inside of me Glory how do I know because he's changed me from the inside out I'm a new person oh no he says and I trust in his anchor alone what a wonderful thing what a wonderful thing not to trust that you shouted not to trust that I danced around the church or I laid at the altar and I cried brother says alligator tears in this story like you could just cry for 10 days it doesn't matter like that's not why we're saved we're saved because we've confessed our sins we've been baptized and we're trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ to forgive our sins that's the gospel hallelujah amen that's the good news and because he loved us we love him in return and the love of Christ and I just I told the the the uh the the the middle schoolers this week Jesus I'm sorry Peter on the day of Pentecost said the love of God is shed abroad in your hearts so when you really get saved God's love is poured into your heart you just love people hallelujah you might struggle sometimes but overall you love people they might get on your nerves sometimes you pray for them sometimes they get on all of our nerves right we got to pray for them we're human we'll still battle those effects I'm almost done and at this coming revival may we just be so full of your charm Lord charm anybody ever prayed for charm lately oh Lord Make Me A Charming preacher that's the wrong charm he talk about the charm of Christ the car the character the Holiness the sweetness is the humility of Christ Lord fill me with your charm Lord until many will come in and be saved the little Community here where we've tried so hard the LA the first Revival now in 10 years that I've held now I pray that you'll give us that real real spirit in our hearts and may anchor there for eternity we had a good Revival with brother McBride right three days in a row prayed what we prayed two and a half hours 30 minutes a day up to that Revival stiring up our hearts Grant it Lord make us to examine ourselves we married people by the way we treat our wives huh so you can you can examine Yourself by the way you treat the people in your house absolutely that's the best examination and the church said everybody everybody behind me on that one how true we are or how true our wives is to us and maybe we just get in our hearts this morning how we'd think if something like that happened in our home and then may we turn our affection toward you and say oh God be merciful to me now let's stand our feet I'm going to close with uh 1 Corinthians 13 just such a beautiful chapter Malachi can come uh Lydia if you want to I will go through Lord willing I will preach every one of these words and then uh explain them because that would be a great review for me but let's just read it over and ask God to speak to our hearts here though I speak with tongues of men and of angels and have not charity I'm become as a sounding brass or tinkling symbol when I was raised I saw growing up I saw so many people speak in tongues but if they don't have love it was just make it was just noise just noise I saw so many people speak in tongues right and then I question did they have the love of God but thank thank God I mean I'm thankful if it's a real genuine tongue thank God for that but you got to have love with it and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all mystery now I love that because I believe we understand all the Mysteries that are called Bible Mysteries and all knowledge but even though I have all that I have all faith I could move remove mountains and have not charity I'm still nothing I've had uh you know people email me and say wow brother Jesse one thing I love about online is you're so kind in your comments now not all the time sometimes I feel a real rebuke Spirit come on me I try to rebuke some people sometimes but um but this is Sister Sister sent me a voice voice message last year and said I know you uh you have God in you because you're so kind you have love for all these people that are unkind to you and I do pray for them I don't pray hours for them but I you know if they write an evil comment I'll just pray right there God help them be merciful to them open their hearts so they don't go to hell they say such awful things they blashe the Holy Ghost and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it doesn't profit anything so Church what is your anchor you need to suffer long see why it's so important to suffer long church that proves you're anchored oh God hasn't answered my prayer keep suffering that proves you got God's anchor Hallelujah is that is that what the Bible says or no It's Kind even when you don't feel like being kind be kind because that's the anchor charity envies not so don't envy people for what they got or or what you want be happy for them charity vaunteth not itself it's not puffed up it doesn't want its own way it does not behave itself unseemly it doesn't seek its own way it's not easily provoked and it doesn't think evil we're getting to some real maturity right here we're getting some real deepness right here this is the anchor this Paul knew this is what they need needed the Holy Ghost directed him to write this this is what he needed love does not behave okay I already read that okay I love this one love does not rejoice in iniquity see remember remember the workers of iniquity they rejoice in iniquity that's why they keep doing it but love of God does not rejoice in iniquity it rejoices in the truth and charity can bear all things it can put up with people no matter what they say it can put up with them and still love them it can believe all things right it can hope all things it can endure all things and the church said how many feel challenged to show some more love out there tonight let's bow our heads here just sing that little course I love him I love him because he first loved me I kind of felt inspired here to preach this here tonight hope it was a blessing by God's grace Hallelujah father God we just come to you tonight Lord God I preached your word Lord God I'm
