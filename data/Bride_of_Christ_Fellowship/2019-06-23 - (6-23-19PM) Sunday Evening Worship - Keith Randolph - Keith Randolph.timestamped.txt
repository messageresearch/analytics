[31:46] in this congregation and we believe this
[31:49] building we could say it was good to be
[31:53] in the house of God has those disciples
[31:58] were walking along on the road to Emmaus
[32:00] and they were talking about the Lord
[32:04] your prophet said if we'll talk about

[32:21] of Jesus Christ amen and amen we greet
[32:27] you tonight and they belong just you
[32:31] know it's kind of strange that my
[32:36] message tonight was supposed to be the
[32:38] juniper-tree in the unseen but it got
[32:41] changed this morning could say you can
[32:44] see I was not sure because I brought
[32:46] these other notes with me this morning I
[32:48] said I better take them with me because
[32:50] you don't know what I usually am gonna
[32:52] never hardly ever change my mind there's
[32:54] been a few times when I'm going to
[32:56] pre-fit I just couldn't get I couldn't
[32:59] get settled in everything and I my wife
[33:02] sent me a message I said I was worried
[33:05] about you and I prayed she praying for
[33:07] me cuz I was worried about you my
[33:08] everything was fine but my mind was not
[33:11] fixed yet so I make her prayers helped a
[33:14] man so now we're going to talk about the
[33:16] mission field we're gonna talk about my
[33:17] testimony a little bit too and we're
[33:19] going to put it together but goes to
[33:21] some interesting things you may not know
[33:23] and we will tell you tonight so if you
[33:26] turn in your Bibles we mentioned this
[33:28] this morning we want to read in Acts
[33:31] check
[33:32] 26 and we would like begin reading in
[33:36] verse 12 as the great Apostle Paul is
[33:40] giving his testimony to King Agrippa you
[33:45] ought to understand now he first stood
[33:48] before Felix the Roman and the room and
[33:52] turned him over to Agrippa and here was
[33:57] Paul wasn't Roman you know he could
[34:02] plead his case but he was giving his
[34:05] testimony sometimes we can give our
[34:07] testimony that's a great thing to do I
[34:12] just tell you this I gave my testimony
[34:14] in 1995 in a form of a message in Baguio
[34:18] City and the pillar fire appeared in the
[34:21] service i've snow pillar of fire as
[34:23] peered in more than one time in the
[34:26] meetings in the philippines it was taken
[34:29] captured by film and i have the film
[34:32] that nothing wrong with the camera I've
[34:35] seen the supernatural and I've seen
[34:37] great things but here we want to read
[34:40] now we're alone as I went to Damascus
[34:44] with authority and commission from the
[34:46] chief preached at midday Oh King I saw
[34:49] away a light from heaven above the
[34:53] brightness of the sun shining around
[34:55] about me in them which journeyed with me
[34:57] and when we were all fallen to the earth
[35:00] I heard a voice speaking unto me and
[35:02] saying in the Hebrew tongue Saul Saul
[35:06] why persecutest thou me it is hard for
[35:10] thee to kick against the pricks and I
[35:12] said who art thou Lord and he said I am
[35:15] Jesus whom thou persecuted but arise
[35:18] stand upon my feet for I've appeared
[35:21] unto thee for this purpose to make the a
[35:23] minister and a witness both of these
[35:26] things which thou has seen and the
[35:28] things in which I will appear unto thee
[35:31] delivering V from the people and from
[35:34] the Gentiles unto whom now I send thee
[35:37] to open their eyes and turn and to turn
[35:42] from darkness to light
[35:44] turn the
[35:45] from darkness to light and from the
[35:47] power of Satan unto God that they may
[35:49] receive forgiveness of sins inheritance
[35:53] among them which are sanctified by faith
[35:55] that is in me
[35:57] I like that by faith that is with me you
[36:00] know one time Paul said the Word of God
[36:02] is nigh me even in my heart the word of
[36:06] faith that I preach sometimes we don't
[36:07] have to call him then we just call him
[36:08] up amen amen
[36:10] we're applauding Oh King Agrippa I was
[36:13] not disobedient unto the heavenly vision
[36:16] you may be seated
[36:18] make his blessings to the reading of it
[36:21] if I could just put a little title to
[36:23] this a little message tonight then I
[36:26] don't know how long we'll be here but I
[36:29] hope it will become interesting you not
[36:32] ashamed of my heritage not ashamed of my
[36:36] heritage now it's amazing how that King
[36:41] Agrippa heard this testimony and he was
[36:45] almost persuaded to be a Christian
[36:48] almost that's not good enough is it
[36:51] almost you know we go back to his hair
[36:55] it just like I told you this morning he
[36:58] come from from the it's a truth
[37:00] you can look it up you can search it out
[37:02] if you want but now and some 16-6 David
[37:08] said the lines are fallen unto me in
[37:10] Pleasant places a measuring line yea I
[37:15] have a goodly heritage a portion or an
[37:19] inheritance the Bible says were joint
[37:22] heirs with Jesus Christ in heavenly
[37:26] places sometimes we can give a testimony
[37:30] but it's a great thing now my testimony
[37:36] starts when I was at a crib as a baby I
[37:44] could remember in the crib as a baby now
[37:49] you might not believe this but I can
[37:52] remember at the end
[37:56] my bed seeing a demonic spirit in flesh
[38:02] you know what it said to me when you get
[38:06] older I'm gonna get you now some people
[38:09] say that was just your imagination
[38:11] that is stood out in my mind I'm 72
[38:15] years old and I will never forget it but
[38:18] you know what he didn't get me but he
[38:21] tried to if you will see my life as it
[38:24] went on he would look like he was going
[38:27] to get me but he didn't get me now I'm
[38:33] thankful tonight I can say this was an
[38:37] honest heart I am glad that it raised in
[38:42] a message home because I mean it
[38:43] wouldn't you couldn't say there was a
[38:45] message distinctly distinctively that
[38:48] many years ago in a sense but I'm glad
[38:50] I'm that I was raised in a Southern
[38:54] Baptist off yield of profit you know
[38:57] what he was ordained in a Southern
[38:59] Baptist Church preacher Davis was a
[39:03] Southern Baptist preacher that's hell
[39:07] [Music]
[39:10] senior moment Willie Upshaw heard about
[39:14] the message was from brother Davis and
[39:17] that's how you know and what really
[39:20] Upshaw was either I think president of
[39:22] the Southern Baptist Convention or
[39:23] something yeah and I'm glad I was raised
[39:26] that I was raised in a strict Oh as a
[39:29] little boy as a little boy they would
[39:33] stand me behind something you know I
[39:37] guess I had to sit on stand on something
[39:40] and they would give me long speeches to
[39:43] memorize and say in this big church and
[39:45] I would get up and do what I was
[39:47] supposed to do I did it whether I was
[39:50] sick or not many times I was sick but I
[39:54] did it and it was it was what you call
[39:57] education for me how do you know what's
[40:00] going to happen later on and I thought
[40:03] when my father died this old man that I
[40:07] knew
[40:07] oh man walked up to me
[40:10] he said I remember teeth when you would
[40:13] get up as a little boy and you would
[40:16] give your speeches he said that's the
[40:18] best entertainment we had that's right
[40:25] that was a raising you know without the
[40:30] strict raising of a father like I say I
[40:33] was glad to be raised in a strict oh my
[40:37] I mean my dad we didn't my dad didn't
[40:39] believe in card playing we didn't play
[40:41] an old maid or anything like that if I
[40:44] got using baseball cars my dad as a whip
[40:46] me good we didn't believe in gambling
[40:49] didn't believe in dancing if they did
[40:51] square dancing in the school they tried
[40:53] to make me do that they'd have Oh they'd
[40:55] have a man there that was six foot two
[40:57] with broad shoulders telling me you
[40:58] better not do that they saw him they
[41:01] wouldn't do it I'm glad for that kind of
[41:06] reason you know I got my discipline with
[41:08] an old belt you know my dad would come
[41:11] home from work and have an old sweat
[41:14] belt and he would lay that bill on the
[41:16] dining room tech just for me to watch
[41:18] and look but you know I inherited that
[41:21] belt used I used the belt measure on my
[41:24] boys to I think worked on me it'll work
[41:27] on them also and it did work on them
[41:30] I've told this story many times I'm
[41:33] going to give you a little bit of life
[41:34] store we're going to go all the way down
[41:36] to when I got married all the way down
[41:38] to the house of Nathan Ohio and then the
[41:40] mission field I'm gonna try to get
[41:43] moving on real good if I don't lose my
[41:45] lose my place and I think I've almost
[41:47] lost it I'm having a senior moment yeah
[41:50] when you get my age sometimes you have a
[41:51] senior moment but I remember one time
[41:54] you know I don't know if I told the
[41:56] story here before you know back in the
[41:59] back in the 60s of the smoking was a big
[42:02] thing smoking cigarettes everybody
[42:04] smoked my dad was raised on a farm down
[42:09] in Tennessee he told me one time he said
[42:12] when I was a little boy everybody smoked
[42:16] down he was a little fella smoking a
[42:18] cigarette
[42:19] and Here Come his daddy and his daddy
[42:21] almost caught him my dad said I swaddled
[42:24] cigarette well my my father hated
[42:30] smoking
[42:31] Deacon's in our church smoked and they
[42:33] go out on the front menthe dad hated
[42:35] smoke and worse than anything he hated
[42:37] drinkin and stuff like that and I
[42:40] remember as a young model fifteen year
[42:42] old boy I thought man I'm gonna smoke me
[42:45] some cigarettes in it I did I remember
[42:51] the first one I sloped I coughed like
[42:53] crazy but it got easier and easier but I
[42:57] remember that I'm getting away with
[42:58] murder
[42:59] I'm getting away with murder my daddy
[43:01] ain't gonna catch me
[43:02] my daddy was smarter than I thought you
[43:05] know when you're 16 year 1516 you think
[43:09] your daddy ain't got no smarts at all
[43:11] you find out he's really smart I when I
[43:15] had my first car was a 54 Chevrolet and
[43:18] my dad would let me drive that back then

[43:23] don't hook the speedometer so my dad
[43:25] wouldn't see how many miles I drove our
[43:29] speak stick he could be but I found out
[43:33] that every time my dad saw somebody
[43:38] smoking a cigarette and I'd say man I
[43:40] like that that guy's not me he's I mean
[43:42] like a hero my dad said but he smokes so
[43:47] I would the rule our house was right
[43:50] here and the road went down like that
[43:52] and turned to another road and I would
[43:55] walk down there and turn to the other
[43:57] road and get me one of it then go back
[44:04] home my dad probably smelled it what it
[44:13] was honest a Saturday night and I put my

[46:22] get away from that Baptist doctrine I
[46:24] was indoctrinated as a 10 year old boy
[46:29] now Sunday School in the Southern
[46:32] Baptist
[46:33] they had classes for boys and classes
[46:35] for girls the boys had their teacher and
[46:38] I learned a lot in Sunday school in fact
[46:41] when I was 10 years old they gave me a
[46:43] Smith's Bible hardback Bible dictionary
[46:46] and you know what I never used that
[46:48] dictionary until I was called to preach
[46:52] and I still got it in 1957 that was
[46:57] given to me they must have seen
[46:59] something in me but somebody happened
[47:07] years went on graduated from high school
[47:13] my dad got me a job at General Motors
[47:17] and you know everything was going good I
[47:21] had worked there a year and I got laid

[48:03] o'clock and pick up my buddy he'd get
[48:06] out of his car because he drove a
[48:08] Halina convertible and that was square
[48:10] back then you had to have a two-door
[48:13] hardtop to be in and so we drove I'm
[48:15] freshness and you know what he said to
[48:17] me we were driving through that you want
[48:21] to meet a couple of sisters sure wife
[48:30] can't
[48:31] standeth I tell this he said they're
[48:33] looking for husbands my wife says that I
[48:36] wasn't looking for no husband and so we
[48:39] got in the backseat my life was ruined
[48:45] I'd already told my mom and dad a few
[48:48] months before I'll never get married but
[48:52] it was love at first sight so every
[48:57] night every night I wouldn't call him
[49:03] from home cuz I did what my mom and dad
[49:04] hearing me I never would hardly call a
[49:07] girl oh my dad hear myself I'd go to
[49:10] precious payphone and I'm old place then
[49:14] and I'd say can I come out said you'd
[49:18] come out next night can you come out
[49:20] sure you come out next night can you

[49:25] is going good until I got a letter
[49:30] report for your physical in Cincinnati
[49:34] being drafted into the armed forces that
[49:39] had went on for three weeks
[49:41] so when I I took her home the last night
[49:47] known her for three weeks I asked her
[49:51] will you marry me
[49:53] and she said yes now that's quick innit
[49:57] well then I went to Creek for thirteen
[50:00] months we got married when I home but
[50:05] let me tell you something halfway
[50:06] through my duty station a Korea I found
[50:11] out I need to go to Japan have a good
[50:14] time or I could fly home on a military
[50:17] hop flying with the cargo and go home
[50:21] for free I thought it over I'm going
[50:27] home and you're the reason I was going
[50:30] home I wasn't going home seeing my
[50:31] mother and father but when I flew on
[50:34] that big cargo jet the cargo was in the
[50:38] middle and we sent like this like that
[50:42] all the way from
[50:45] Korea to LA I don't remember any
[50:51] bathrooms I can't remember being said
[50:57] but I did that for one reason passion
[51:06] like I get to that Airport then when you
[51:09] went to the airport they could come down
[51:10] they didn't have to wait they come right
[51:13] down to you so I could see her face and
[51:15] I've often thought if I can have that
[51:17] same kind of a passion well I could why
[51:20] can't I put Co him on the front of that
[51:22] compassion for Saints compassion for
[51:26] sinners well this started something
[51:31] because around 1966 the house of faith
[51:41] in Dayton Ohio pastor Frank Ramey maybe
[51:48] I don't know exactly when was going
[51:53] missing and putting somebody in controls
[51:57] the service what he was doing he was
[52:00] going to Jeffersonville Indiana and my
[52:03] understanding was there when the seals
[52:05] was preached and when he came back went
[52:15] to a motel and I'm over it said he got
[52:18] him a room he said brother Brennan is
[52:20] either a prophet a true prophet or a
[52:22] false prophet there can't be no in
[52:23] between
[52:23] so he went there and he waited and he
[52:29] testified that an angel came in the room
[52:32] and touched him he went back to the
[52:36] church he said I'm changing the order of
[52:40] the church and
[52:44] anybody here that wants to be rebaptised
[52:46] in the name of Lord Jesus Christ you
[52:48] come forward you know who was the first
[52:50] one that come for mom mother
[52:51] law sister Lena died she testifies I
[52:56] didn't even understand at first but I
[52:58] was following my pastor would you
[53:02] believe some of them that got rebaptised
[53:05] wanted to get baptized back again in
[53:07] name of the Father Son the Holy Ghost
[53:08] that's the truth he preached the message
[53:12] West Virginia Kentucky in Ohio and sent
[53:19] up hundreds of books every week well he
[53:27] was on a Sunday morning we got high got
[53:31] home from Korea me and my wife not come
[53:34] home from California because after I got
[53:36] home from free I was stationed in
[53:37] California to Nike missile base we got
[53:40] married and went to California and what
[53:42] we got home I was in a big our home
[53:45] church and I was under conviction and I
[53:49] went to the altar they got the
[53:56] membership booked out like that then
[53:58] asked me to pray or anything I went home
[54:01] and suffered through that praying to get
[54:03] the victory praying to get the victory
[54:06] but my I think it was that night my wife
[54:09] went to the house of faith and butwho
[54:11] her way to Calvary I was baptized the
[54:17] name of the Father Son the Holy Ghost
[54:18] and she was baptized name of the Lord
[54:20] Jesus Christ that was in 1968 twelve
[54:29] years went by many things happened I
[54:36] remember I told my
[54:41] you go to your torch and I'll go to mine
[54:43] but I did something was insane for me I
[54:46] said I'll give you half my ties you give
[54:51] him to your church and I'll take mine
[54:52] brother Ramey testifies her body had
[54:55] left him he lived off my ties you know
[55:00] and and I go to pick her up and man I
[55:07] said are they ever gonna quit in there
[55:10] and my wife and look out the window and
[55:15] brother Amy what he would do it don't
[55:17] worry about Keith he's gonna be all
[55:19] right because it was it was about 1976 I
[55:27] already knew I had a call to preach I
[55:29] took two young people
[55:33] trustee and the Baptist Church but I
[55:34] couldn't be a deacon or preach you know
[55:36] that was true and it would be the same
[55:39] way if your the message of her if your
[55:42] wife wasn't unbeliever you know so that
[55:45] was good doctrine
[55:46] I was raised with that good doctrine but
[55:50] he came mother Amy had an aneurysm
[55:54] almost died had to give up the church
[55:58] and he moved away and he came back from
[56:01] West Virginia he lives in Arizona he's
[56:04] in his 90s but when he came back to the
[56:08] church to hold a meeting I went I always
[56:14] said I like brother Amy but I didn't
[56:20] really like what he believed you know I
[56:22] liked him so my mother-in-law myself and
[56:30] my wife were sitting over by the side
[56:35] and
[56:38] Raymond preaching about the chosen seed
[56:41] of Abraham he lays this Bible kind of
[56:45] hard on the pulpit he walks around to
[56:50] where I'm at he brother Mike Siebert was
[56:53] in this meeting he grabbed me by the
[56:55] head like this in yanked my head that
[56:58] was dangerous back to him then yanked my
[57:00] head down like that I had a terrible you
[57:04] know you yanked my head down like that
[57:06] and he pointed to my wife I couldn't see
[57:09] it I heard it there's a lot of people in
[57:12] that meeting said this what brother Amy
[57:14] this one brother I know exactly what he
[57:16] said he said told my wife God was
[57:20] already dealing with my wife to follow
[57:23] me wherever I go he pointed to her you
[57:28] follow brother Keith for every ghost
[57:30] because he's a chosen seed of Abraham
[57:34] but you know that wasn't good enough
[57:38] she read were Gideon had put a fleece
[57:41] out so she put a fleece out under the
[57:46] kitchen a jar and said I'm not even sure
[57:51] how many flies I can't remember for sure
[57:54] she said if so many flies is in this jar
[57:58] the next morning I do it she coming up
[58:02] the next morning you know what was in
[58:04] that jar that amount of flies was in
[58:07] that jar so she followed me wherever I
[58:10] went from Timbuktu it got to a place
[58:14] that I would I would I tell I tell her
[58:19] I'll go visit the church first and if I
[58:22] like it will go back to next week that
[58:24] way we will you won't have to go because
[58:26] I visit one after the other I didn't
[58:28] like it visit us I didn't like it so I

[1:01:39] that noise
[1:01:40] and God would do that so we I couldn't

[1:02:32] happening my godly mother-in-law I
[1:02:35] preached her funeral a couple years she
[1:02:37] died at 96 year a sister of faith I mean
[1:02:40] if you ask her to pray about something
[1:02:42] it come to pass but you know those
[1:02:49] things are
[1:02:49] though that was for me for my growing up
[1:02:55] I didn't know what was in store but
[1:03:02] there come a place when you're Joe
[1:03:05] dissatisfied I wanted the victory so one
[1:03:16] day on my road to work
[1:03:24] I had this 76 international pickup truck
[1:03:30] with a lift on the back we lived on 10
[1:03:32] acres up and it's in Ohio dark County
[1:03:36] close to Greenville
[1:03:37] I remember this if you could have saw me
[1:03:46] talk you could have saw my lips they
[1:03:50] were moving quite a bit in that vehicle
[1:03:52] you know why I was talking to an angel
[1:04:00] for in that vehicle God was speaking to
[1:04:03] me dealing with me personally Paul heard
[1:04:15] a voice I also heard a voice from down
[1:04:18] here I heard a voice and Here I am I
[1:04:25] said I said Lord I was 33 years old at
[1:04:32] that time I said I am old to the gospel
[1:04:36] because I was raised in a Baptist Church
[1:04:38] where you had to go to seminary and to
[1:04:45] be baptized over the name of Lord Jesus
[1:04:47] Christ did you know what this voice
[1:04:51] spoke I'll never forget it so simple
[1:04:56] simplicity you're not happy now but I'll
[1:05:00] make you happy
[1:05:02] so every night I would go home after
[1:05:07] work well get the victory we'd get in an
[1:05:12] argument did one day I ain't going to
[1:05:15] work I was sitting on the couch and I
[1:05:22] confessed the commission that God had
[1:05:24] given me as soon as those words left my
[1:05:29] mouth I was baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:05:35] went out and bought me a new Bible that
[1:05:38] was in February of 1980 I've been
[1:05:41] preaching ever since I was ordained in
[1:05:42] Labor Day of 1980
[1:05:50] well time went on I was 1980 but here
[1:05:57] come a few years down the road I got
[1:06:01] acquainted with a got a brother named
[1:06:03] Jackie Benton came good friends were
[1:06:06] posing ecchi at the camp meeting in
[1:06:09] Michigan in different places I guess or
[1:06:11] whatever he'd come to our church to
[1:06:14] preach I was preaching from 1980 this
[1:06:18] was this in 1990 around 1993 and I made
[1:06:26] a comment to brother Jackie I said the
[1:06:30] next time you go the Philippines it was
[1:06:32] going to be like I forget how many times
[1:06:34] you go the next number I'll go with you
[1:06:37] he you know on the phone I'd come home
[1:06:39] for ministers meeting and brother severs
[1:06:42] ministers meeting and brother Jackie had
[1:06:45] called on the phone I mean he stayed up
[1:06:49] late I went to bed early so sometimes
[1:06:51] he'd call me when I was already in bed
[1:06:53] but he said call me no matter what time
[1:06:56] is so I called him he said you want to
[1:06:59] go with me to the Philippines and I said
[1:07:00] I can't go so I was at work as war as
[1:07:05] retired I was at work doing my job and
[1:07:08] all of a sudden I found myself in the
[1:07:11] office calling about a ticket to the
[1:07:13] Philippines
[1:07:14] I never prayed about it and when I went
[1:07:19] I said I probably only go one time I've
[1:07:23] went 38 times you know and when I first
[1:07:28] went he was wonderful but the first time
[1:07:35] I went they took me up that mountain
[1:07:42] Tibet yo city and a brother I preached
[1:07:47] for a brother and I had really had a bad
[1:07:49] experience at this time with this
[1:07:51] brother and he dropped me off at Baguio
[1:07:54] City and I saw this little skinny
[1:07:55] preacher sitting out on the porch named
[1:07:58] brother Dan or bullet Lin here we got
[1:08:01] together at first we thought we had a
[1:08:05] disagreement from that we didn't have a
[1:08:07] disagreement well that started a
[1:08:10] relationship it started right there and
[1:08:15] when I got home he kept he sent me
[1:08:19] singing tapes now I'm gonna stop right
[1:08:21] here and don't you know something
[1:08:25] somebody paid for his ticket to go to
[1:08:28] Cape Town South Africa and he's going
[1:08:32] the guy wanted to know if I'd go with
[1:08:34] him but when I found out the price of
[1:08:36] tickets so late about $2,000 because
[1:08:40] it's so late he was gonna go July 11th I
[1:08:42] don't know what he's gonna have to pay
[1:08:43] and I couldn't go but they started a
[1:08:48] relationship the next year at a camp
[1:08:53] with Boris Soriano after that camp I
[1:08:58] said I am going to back I said no you're
[1:09:00] not no you're not no you're not said I
[1:09:02] am going
[1:09:03] there's preachers here I said I'm going
[1:09:05] I'm going I wouldn't take no for so
[1:09:07] finally there were some people going
[1:09:09] there for a holiday because baguio city
[1:09:13] in the summer is cruel whether it's like
[1:09:17] a holiday place and they took me and
[1:09:21] stayed there sick
[1:09:22] stays and they got mad cuz I stayed six
[1:09:24] days that was the first time when I was
[1:09:29] there I've reached a couple times and he
[1:09:33] said we're going to go to Gold Creek
[1:09:37] okay preach that morning preached a
[1:09:40] couple more times they were having a
[1:09:43] summer camp in gold Creek so he went to
[1:09:46] go Creek we got to an old abandoned gold
[1:09:50] koi the guy driving the jeepney went too
[1:09:55] far up the gold quarry well and I said
[1:10:00] where's the church up up that mountain
[1:10:04] ain't no Road you got to climb not that
[1:10:07] mountain I've been up that mountain many
[1:10:11] times now I don't go up the mountain
[1:10:13] lake come down that was my first
[1:10:19] experience but when we came down that
[1:10:22] day to go home the brother the jeepney
[1:10:28] turned over and a big deep ravine and
[1:10:34] here I'm in the driver's seat brother
[1:10:36] Danner says get out I said I'm getting
[1:10:40] that place if that Jeep turns over a
[1:10:42] little more I'm crushed so I climbed out
[1:10:44] the back way and then that driver drove
[1:10:49] out of there like he was crazy that's
[1:10:52] the way they drive was that was my first
[1:10:55] experience so they went on to the the
[1:11:00] third time I went I traveled with
[1:11:03] brother Jack T and we separated he went
[1:11:06] and I went north
[1:11:07] I started going north all the time for a
[1:11:12] while been so long I try to remember the
[1:11:20] name I better skip this way I can't
[1:11:23] remember his name now oh my good well
[1:11:28] he was a leper he'd always picked me up
[1:11:31] at the airport a leper that had been
[1:11:34] healed instantaneously for the
[1:11:37] Maximilian cocoa brother Max he had a
[1:11:42] beautiful home and talent the leper
[1:11:44] colonies and everybody couldn't
[1:11:47] understand how max build this home did
[1:11:49] he find see if the Japanese hit go
[1:11:52] during World War two and there's still
[1:11:54] treasure hunting going on did he find
[1:11:57] gold no I don't believe so because he
[1:12:01] always had his hand out to help somebody
[1:12:03] else he picked me up take me where I'm
[1:12:09] going then we go up the back of this
[1:12:10] before brother Dan I got a vehicle in
[1:12:12] everybody's portal almost got vehicles
[1:12:13] now and separated from Brazil I found
[1:12:19] out when I was in Manila man they would
[1:12:22] scream and holler all out in the spirit
[1:12:24] that was wonderful but when I went up to
[1:12:28] the mountains they were eager ah tribes
[1:12:35] many different tribes of the eager odds
[1:12:38] some were headhunters some were not
[1:12:41] headhunters that's where their ancestry
[1:12:43] was and kind of like brother Ram talked
[1:12:47] about the Apache engine it took a look I
[1:12:50] mean you had to gain their confidence
[1:12:53] they were more reserved I'm not saying
[1:12:57] we did it well have great meetings but
[1:12:59] when you when when finally you got their
[1:13:03] friendship you had a friend for life
[1:13:05] there were more reserved more solid not
[1:13:11] borne by every wind of doctor when I
[1:13:13] went over there there was a brother just
[1:13:17] preached at our church and he'll come to
[1:13:20] later but had just been to the
[1:13:24] Philippines he said boy there's a doctor
[1:13:27] going on there one preacher got up and
[1:13:29] preached God cannot die well I want you
[1:13:32] to know the Bible says God kid brother
[1:13:34] Branson God cannot die but he have to
[1:13:36] die I want you
[1:13:39] so when that blood cell was broke
[1:13:42] however it released God brother branham
[1:13:45] said God I we got an answer for
[1:13:50] everything we'll just stay you want to
[1:13:53] be a novice you're having it for
[1:13:56] everything you'll be confused good as
[1:13:58] the author of confusing but peace and
[1:14:00] the Churches of God
[1:14:04] so I started travelling in the north
[1:14:09] brother Joe talked a good brother of
[1:14:12] mine I could never figure out why this
[1:14:16] guy could speak so good English he helps
[1:14:21] him to church twice the pastor but he
[1:14:22] can just go so far and always notice its
[1:14:26] head with jerk I found out he was going
[1:14:32] a be Asian school and he got into drugs
[1:14:39] and what saved him because it's saved
[1:14:46] him for that life of corruption and he
[1:14:49] got healed now he's in the ministry if
[1:14:53] those if he not kept going in that and
[1:14:56] that aviation and probably never met God
[1:14:59] you could look at it in a way you see
[1:15:02] what I'm trying to say I baptized his
[1:15:06] mother and bontoc in the river with
[1:15:09] tribal markings up and down her legs
[1:15:11] because he was of the headhunters and
[1:15:13] they still hunt heads in the Philippines
[1:15:18] well this went on uh I found out I said
[1:15:25] when I go I'm not going to take sides
[1:15:27] but I found out I was taking sides with
[1:15:29] Jesus and I found out I was north I
[1:15:32] crossed over Jordan in decadence
[1:15:35] Fairland
[1:15:36] and that's what's the matter with me I
[1:15:39] could have stayed down there with the
[1:15:41] big meetings and all all the whooping
[1:15:43] howl and all the grand but I escaped
[1:15:50] a lot of corruption yeah so it went on
[1:15:56] and brother Danner now listen I'm will
[1:16:01] focus in he has put in his visa to come
[1:16:06] to the USA alright
[1:16:09] I've told a couple of other churches I
[1:16:12] even told brother cam he is a cowboy a
[1:16:17] Filipino cowboy I don't know if you've
[1:16:22] ever heard him catch his music on
[1:16:25] Facebook and the Crusades baguio city is
[1:16:29] known for one thing
[1:16:30] country music ever since I've known
[1:16:36] those brothers they've walked the
[1:16:38] mountains with cowboy boots on and we
[1:16:41] say singing our Crusades with cowboy
[1:16:43] hats on to draw the crowd I've had I
[1:16:54] couldn't tell you how many Crusades I
[1:16:57] love to preach in the churches but I
[1:17:00] love to preach outside I can tell you of
[1:17:04] the miracles that's taking place in the
[1:17:07] churches but let me tell you when I was
[1:17:12] a brother cans both oh this this is
[1:17:15] American style there was a young man
[1:17:18] came for prayer and he said I have
[1:17:25] sinned I am back slid I don't know his
[1:17:30] name God led to me to say this I said
[1:17:39] God never left you you left him and so I
[1:17:43] said it over and over I said where did
[1:17:45] you leave him you think I was
[1:17:48] browbeating him I said where did you
[1:17:49] leave me who did you leave me where did
[1:17:53] you leave it where he said finally I
[1:17:55] left he meant mother's house that I
[1:17:58] could pray for sometimes you
[1:18:03] find where the problem is before
[1:18:06] deliverance can come when I was in

[1:18:20] meeting the last one that came was
[1:18:26] grandma little boy and she said doctors
[1:18:33] have said that he's blind in his right
[1:18:37] eye I prayed I stepped away and brother
[1:18:44] Addison was kneeling talking to the
[1:18:46] little boy I said to myself was he
[1:18:47] praying for him again
[1:18:48] no he stood up he said I held my hand
[1:18:54] over the little boy's good eye and say
[1:18:58] can you see said yes I can see no doc
[1:19:02] the signs shall follow them that believe

[1:19:36] certain system in the Philippines in

[1:19:47] poor nations and when I got there they
[1:19:51] took me to a stopping place been there

[1:21:03] way to the mountains to offer to

[1:35:00] other churches of hannahb remember their
[1:35:04] names and big erat though all of the
[1:35:09] ignorant blood but even there there's a
[1:35:14] mixture of blood because even before
[1:35:19] world war ii the japanese even during
[1:35:23] war ii the japanese were living up in
[1:35:26] those mountains if you look at brother
[1:35:30] Dan er
[1:35:31] I always called him a Japanese kamikaze
[1:35:35] pilot the way he drove one time we were
[1:35:42] going down the road and well I'll give
[1:35:50] it a story he left me behind
[1:35:53] at a certain preachers house and there
[1:35:56] were two preachers there trying to turn
[1:35:59] me against him another brother and when
[1:36:03] I got back when he got back I told him
[1:36:07] said did you ever leave me like that
[1:36:09] again so when we left that house all
[1:36:16] right well I was sitting in the vehicle
[1:36:17] I saw him on the front porch of that
[1:36:20] church reading the riot act to those
[1:36:23] preachers brother Danner was known for
[1:36:25] his temper man was he hot he was tearing
[1:36:28] them to pieces Nick fending me so he got
[1:36:33] in his little red toy out at the time it
[1:36:37] was raining it wasn't supposed to rainy
[1:36:38] we were going to bought them bought them
[1:36:40] tarrlok you ain't lived till you went to
[1:36:43] bottom bought them tarrlok I was in Oh
[1:36:49] can't think of it name another place
[1:36:52] before but in this place that same day
[1:36:57] I had preached and I was sitting under
[1:37:02] this lean-to trying to keep cool it's
[1:37:07] hot and they came to me said if you ever
[1:37:13] ate goat I said no would you like to eat
[1:37:20] some sure and he brought me brown gravy
[1:37:26] I began to eat it the more I chewed the
[1:37:32] bigger it God
[1:37:35] so I told it had a funny taste I told
[1:37:40] the brothers you eat it
[1:37:42] cuz I got a preach and a little bit that
[1:37:46] was my excuse
[1:37:47] a few days later going down the road
[1:37:54] brother Danner was laughing hysterically
[1:37:58] laughing he said you know what you ate
[1:38:04] you ate young goat with the goat dung
[1:38:07] still in it and you know what I told him
[1:38:12] you got me once you won't get me twice
[1:38:16] but I'm afraid he's probably got me two
[1:38:19] or three more times most of time they
[1:38:22] try to protect me but now it's not so
[1:38:25] bad I go to places they know me but if I
[1:38:28] go someplace they don't know me I have
[1:38:30] to eat what they put before me
[1:38:32] I've seen the ribcage of a dog in the
[1:38:35] cafeteria I saw a old mangy dog come up
[1:38:40] to church and Wilson said that same dog
[1:38:44] we got a dog restaurant here they'll
[1:38:46] take that mangy dog sell it to the dog
[1:38:49] restaurant once I myself went I myself
[1:38:52] this sister this was a belongin Buzzard
[1:38:57] Anders home place I was staying in this
[1:39:00] house and watching out the window
[1:39:03] between services I saw this sister come
[1:39:06] over argued was another sister they were
[1:39:09] loved each other but they was
[1:39:11] arguing the sister was trying to buy to
[1:39:15] the dogs but the price was too high he
[1:39:19] she went home
[1:39:20] mad why did they want the dog they
[1:39:23] wanted to eat the dog I remember when I
[1:39:27] was in Korea I wasn't living for God we
[1:39:32] go to a bar and we would order off the
[1:39:37] outside that nalli whatever and they
[1:39:43] would bring in boarder fly shrimp but it
[1:39:46] was so good and they would bring in this
[1:39:48] other stuff penny I don't remember what
[1:39:50] it's called many it was delicious
[1:39:51] every dog it was french fried on the
[1:39:56] outside with onions and meat on the
[1:39:58] inside man sgi's we just loved it
[1:40:03] finally we asked the lady that would go
[1:40:05] outside one cooked inside it was outside
[1:40:08] in the big pot what is this she said
[1:40:12] it's not all when you know us GI we had
[1:40:18] our pet dogs at home we never ate it
[1:40:21] again I remember leaving none gawa and
[1:40:28] they fixed the meal and I saw this on
[1:40:33] the table it looked like fruit fried
[1:40:35] onion rings man I love onion rings you
[1:40:37] know I asked him what is that french
[1:40:42] fried chicken guts they like the end
[1:40:49] like the outside one time brother Danner
[1:40:53] had a big pot cooked in a big pot and he
[1:40:56] was eating chicken feet pull it out
[1:40:58] crunch crunch crunch pulling out crunch
[1:40:59] crunch crunch crunch crunch crunch I
[1:41:01] said brother Danner they got pizza house
[1:41:03] I eat pizza over there I said which
[1:41:05] would you rather have a piece pizza or
[1:41:08] chicken feet what'd he do he'd grab
[1:41:10] another chicken feet and crunch crunch
[1:41:13] crunch the answer my question you really
[1:41:14] have them chicken feet toenails and all
[1:41:16] I ain't built that way I can eat just so
[1:41:25] much rice but when I go up into the
[1:41:27] mountains you ought to grow up in the
[1:41:28] mountains potatoes and sweet potatoes
[1:41:32] are they're pretty good when I go up
[1:41:35] there fried chicken they know when I'm
[1:41:39] coming many times I believe they
[1:41:42] probably killed the last chicken when I
[1:41:44] come just for me and I don't turn it
[1:41:46] down I eat it partly because God will
[1:41:50] bless them I've been many places I
[1:41:52] walked a panoramic view one place and
[1:41:55] the lowlands near the ocean called lone
[1:41:58] Ian I remember in 1997 preaching on the
[1:42:03] porch before a church was started there
[1:42:05] and the little sister's husband in the
[1:42:09] house was in bed sick and I had this
[1:42:13] crusade meeting and I'll never forget
[1:42:20] outdoors when I gave the altar call I
[1:42:24] noticed system not the same system but
[1:42:26] another sister when I'd read the Bible
[1:42:29] she would stand and make one step
[1:42:30] forward and she had pants on and then
[1:42:34] they would had an altar service she
[1:42:38] stepped forward with her paints on you
[1:42:42] know what she said I want the baptism of
[1:42:45] the Holy Ghost you know what I said to
[1:42:48] her are you willing to give up
[1:42:51] everything she says certainly I am I
[1:42:55] prayed for her that's the most godly
[1:42:57] sister when I go there and I see a
[1:43:00] panoramic view she's
[1:43:02] the outside will and she'll tell me
[1:43:05] that's your room every time you come
[1:43:07] here and the other little sister she's
[1:43:12] in her 90s now from those meetings when
[1:43:23] she came to the Lord she was Roman
[1:43:25] Catholic she was respected in the
[1:43:27] community as a Roman Catholic she didn't
[1:43:32] know what to give up she come - brother
[1:43:36] Danner what should I give up
[1:43:40] he said give up your pant I give it up
[1:43:42] give us up I give it up every time he'd
[1:43:44] tell her something I give it up every
[1:43:46] time I I give it up now every time I see
[1:43:52] her what a blessing it is she's got my
[1:43:56] picture up in her house she can't speak
[1:44:00] any English it has to be an interpreter
[1:44:02] the last time I preached there a couple
[1:44:04] years ago maybe not even a you two maybe
[1:44:09] a year and a half ago she heard I was
[1:44:12] coming if if they if you brother Brent
[1:44:16] said if you get the people to believe
[1:44:17] you there is nothing impossible she
[1:44:23] walked to the meeting that was going to
[1:44:27] be about seven o'clock came about three
[1:44:30] o'clock in the afternoon
[1:44:32] excited that I was going to be there and
[1:44:39] when I prayed she came into the building
[1:44:42] like that's the way she walked I prayed
[1:44:48] for prayed for others she came and she
[1:44:53] was sitting I didn't notice how she was
[1:44:57] sitting I know what she's sitting normal
[1:44:58] and she began to speak he's probably
[1:45:01] like oh no not like dr. Garland and it
[1:45:05] was interpreted to me she stood up I'm
[1:45:08] healed back standing straight up if you
[1:45:11] just get the people to believe you you
[1:45:14] can just get them to have coffee
[1:45:15] you I have gained their confidence in
[1:45:20] those mountains I've seen hundreds give
[1:45:25] a heart I couldn't tell you how many how
[1:45:28] many's been healed but in bomb talk this
[1:45:34] last time it is a mountain on top of a
[1:45:38] mountain its way up there and it's an
[1:45:45] unusual city it's just a little village
[1:45:48] what kind of promise the only site see
[1:45:52] there they have hanging mummies but
[1:45:56] they're just about all been terrorized
[1:45:58] or whatever you know gone but I used to
[1:46:02] walk down the streets I mean I'd be in
[1:46:05] the vehicle not see up in the mountain
[1:46:08] now it looked to me like Europeans
[1:46:10] usually can tell American to me they'd
[1:46:13] look is your German I don't know and I
[1:46:19] and I never ask questions for a while
[1:46:20] I'm fine I said who are these people why
[1:46:24] are they here there's nothing here some
[1:46:27] lodges well-dressed drugs cheap drugs
[1:46:32] they go there get a cheap high so ahead
[1:46:36] tonight crusade one place I traveled all
[1:46:41] night to have a crusade on all night to
[1:46:43] get back before I got home I want will
[1:46:44] that sleep for two or three days but in
[1:46:48] Sagada we put up the crusade you can't
[1:46:53] do that here at the police station
[1:46:57] overnight put all the instruments walked
[1:47:01] him up in the police station I've got
[1:47:08] pictures I didn't know they'd come in
[1:47:11] whispered to me some of those Americans
[1:47:16] they call them I don't know what they
[1:47:17] were are in the meeting they're sitting
[1:47:20] in the meeting I got pictures at home
[1:47:22] that were taken they were there
[1:47:23] listening but this two-day crusade was
[1:47:28] to me it was it was amazing I've had
[1:47:34] great Crusades I've had great healings
[1:47:36] but I come to I've come to the place
[1:47:39] when I have a crusade meeting I don't
[1:47:41] use notes I read the scripture my
[1:47:47] message is prepared here and here I'm
[1:47:51] preaching to a different kind of a
[1:47:52] congregation and it really an
[1:47:56] evangelistic message mother dinner I was
[1:47:59] supposed to this last trip to preach in
[1:48:01] a youth camp and go to another island I
[1:48:07] got a message messenger another dinner
[1:48:12] as I know were posed to do this and do
[1:48:14] this but said I have got a burden to
[1:48:17] just have crusade meetings in these
[1:48:18] places what do you say they said that's
[1:48:22] what I'm called to do brother
[1:48:24] is that that's a to agreeing that's what
[1:48:28] we did so we went there I had other
[1:48:31] Crusades this trip but when we went
[1:48:35] there was so amazing because here I am
[1:48:39] preaching to people many of them or
[1:48:44] pagan they dressed real nice but they're
[1:48:47] still pagan did I tell you what the
[1:48:50] headhunters do now this is a fact I was
[1:48:54] told this they dress just like anybody
[1:48:57] else and if you offend one they'll
[1:49:04] invite you over to their house for
[1:49:05] something to eat and cut your head off I
[1:49:08] am not making that up
[1:49:12] I've had people come people don't
[1:49:15] believe it but I got the most reliable
[1:49:19] source and there's one of those
[1:49:20] Europeans went missing in Sagada they
[1:49:26] come bodies with no head long as they
[1:49:33] don't get my head I got a nun you
[1:49:37] your head over there you know a big head
[1:49:41] I don't know you know mom in Pakistan
[1:49:47] those Pakistanis didn't like you know I
[1:49:50] I would be I would I would be preaching
[1:49:53] the only time we had daytime meetings
[1:49:56] was two or three days I give a two-door
[1:50:03] today you might say seminar brother Clem
[1:50:07] did and I would try to go out so I would
[1:50:10] go outside because there was believers
[1:50:12] outside and I go outside the building
[1:50:14] and they say get back in this building
[1:50:16] get back in the building get back in the
[1:50:18] building cause the color of this hair
[1:50:22] when I get finished preaching one of the
[1:50:26] 101 old brother would grab me and run me
[1:50:29] to the cam and get me in the cab and
[1:50:31] hold my head down when I was preaching
[1:50:39] I'm growing to Pakistan from the
[1:50:43] Philippines right now when I was in
[1:50:46] Pakistan I preached in this place this
[1:50:53] one brother now Karachi has the largest
[1:50:59] Christian community even though it's an
[1:51:01] Allah Islamic nation and it was a
[1:51:03] Pentecostal church brother Shamoon your
[1:51:07] group had been dealing with them and
[1:51:09] during this service if you ever heard
[1:51:15] the music it drive you crazy and I'm
[1:51:24] sitting there and I'm going numb from
[1:51:27] the music and I'm saying I wouldn't want
[1:51:31] them to hear that but I said what am I
[1:51:35] gonna do I got a preach Lord dealt with
[1:51:40] me to change
[1:51:43] my message I said I can in this script I
[1:51:46] was hunting was I found the scripture
[1:51:48] and you know what I did I gave my
[1:51:51] testimony with my interpreter and when
[1:51:55] we got brother Sherman had hired a
[1:51:58] Pentecostal cab driver because we leave
[1:52:02] our passports and our visas at a Muslim
[1:52:05] run hotel and we had to bypass all the
[1:52:08] checkpoints and we went in got in the
[1:52:14] car
[1:52:15] well the Shamoon begin to speak to
[1:52:18] brother Clem he said I got a secret I
[1:52:24] got a secret I got a secret Don't Tell
[1:52:27] brother Keith he whispered the secret
[1:52:30] and her brother Clem's ear and brother
[1:52:33] Clem could not hold the secret he told
[1:52:37] me the pastor stood up and spoke in Urdu
[1:52:42] and what he said after that service when
[1:52:49] I couldn't find the mind of God it had
[1:52:51] to change the service he said I'm
[1:52:53] bringing my whole church into the
[1:52:55] message and we're going to have a
[1:52:58] baptism in the river and he wanted us to
[1:53:01] baptize and they changed her mind
[1:53:03] I better not baptized in the river it
[1:53:06] may be my last time to baptize in any
[1:53:08] river over there might lose my head he
[1:53:12] never left when there's right down the
[1:53:15] road there's our Colonel Sanders
[1:53:16] and a McDonald's and you can't go we had
[1:53:23] that we stayed at this hotel had a free
[1:53:28] breakfast and traveled down them
[1:53:30] together we'd never leave each other's
[1:53:32] side we would travel down to eating and
[1:53:39] we would go in Muslim run and behind
[1:53:45] this glass the guy would smorgasbord
[1:53:48] style put out the food and that cook
[1:53:50] would look at me like he wanted me dead
[1:53:54] into
[1:53:55] the vast last day that we were there he
[1:53:58] looked at me and smiled he must have
[1:54:01] found out maybe I wasn't because they
[1:54:02] consider the United States big Satan
[1:54:04] Israel little Satan it's a marvelous
[1:54:12] place the message is in a revival there
[1:54:15] because one man separated himself from
[1:54:21] unbelief promote message Church because
[1:54:25] they told him you know what they did
[1:54:28] they told him you can't have these
[1:54:30] denominational preachers sitting on the
[1:54:31] platform I set right next to him when we
[1:54:37] were there he was the only church now
[1:54:40] there's many churches there's many
[1:54:43] believers some of them wouldn't set
[1:54:45] would be on the platform are now
[1:54:46] believing the message one man it's gone
[1:54:58] it's right something else I was gonna
[1:55:00] say about that place there was a
[1:55:05] Catholic community only Catholics and
[1:55:10] our house boy was a cricket player and
[1:55:18] he was rejected to play on the national
[1:55:21] team because he was not Muslim he was
[1:55:25] Roman Catholic and I remember on top of
[1:55:29] the roof me and brother Clem playing
[1:55:31] cricket with him
[1:55:32] yeah and we got acquainted and he
[1:55:38] invited us to his house to blessed it
[1:55:43] blessing the house is a big thing over
[1:55:45] there one time though the Shamoon said
[1:55:50] we're going to bless this house you're
[1:55:53] going to do it go and go in I went in I
[1:55:56] didn't know where he was behind me I
[1:55:57] thought I was going by myself in this
[1:55:58] dark health and when I win family spread
[1:56:01] out we would go into homes brother sir
[1:56:05] moon said you speak you speak
[1:56:07] come
[1:56:08] tell me to speak I shouldn't have left
[1:56:14] that on you I'd forget where I was at
[1:56:18] yes I met his brother brother Wilson
[1:56:25] he was a rental car man
[1:56:30] I dealt with Wilson talked to Wilson
[1:56:36] delved in against you his personality
[1:56:39] sometimes you got it you got to find out
[1:56:42] where people live so they came to our
[1:56:46] hotel before we were leaving that day
[1:56:50] next morning and I begin to deal with
[1:56:55] Wilson that's the older brother about
[1:56:58] the Godhead a Roman Catholic I said do
[1:57:03] you understand what I am saying he said
[1:57:06] yes I said if you ever received Jesus
[1:57:09] Christ as your Lord and Savior no I said
[1:57:12] would you like to receive him into your
[1:57:13] heart right now I let him to the Lord
[1:57:15] before we left nothing happens by
[1:57:18] accident there was a sister there that's
[1:57:25] the reason why I want to go back they
[1:57:29] had three floors we were preaching on
[1:57:32] the top floor and I went down to the
[1:57:33] second floor well no when did we start
[1:57:39] here I don't know oh how long about I've
[1:57:45] been going a long time hour and a half
[1:57:49] oh my goodness I'm gonna quit in a
[1:57:53] minute but let me tell you this I'm
[1:57:56] going to go back to the Philippines this
[1:57:59] is why I want to go back this little
[1:58:03] sister was sitting next to her pastor
[1:58:07] Shamoon every time we pray for her she
[1:58:10] gets sicker and sicker and sicker well
[1:58:15] she would miss her at that time I begin
[1:58:18] to deal with her
[1:58:21] about divine healing in a paradox what
[1:58:25] divine healing was and God quick and me
[1:58:32] I said if you ever receive Jesus Christ
[1:58:35] into your heart I led her to the Lord
[1:58:37] Jesus there and every time I would see
[1:58:41] in another meeting she had this horrible
[1:58:43] look on her face next meeting horrible
[1:58:50] look in pain at the fourth meeting I
[1:58:54] looked out she had a joyful look like
[1:58:58] God had finally touched her divine
[1:59:01] healing so your paradoxes when it
[1:59:03] happens to me D divine healing is a
[1:59:06] process my to happen today why not
[1:59:09] having them all when I have a next week
[1:59:11] but it will happen then go back to the
[1:59:14] Philippines in Sigala we have youth
[1:59:18] meetings a my I never had so many young
[1:59:23] people come I'm preaching and I see
[1:59:26] these people up here I see him over here
[1:59:29] and I'm preaching to them I'm reaching I
[1:59:31] was preaching to the young people and
[1:59:34] they came right off the street may not
[1:59:40] have known anything about God under
[1:59:42] convincing I want you to know everyone
[1:59:44] that comes to the altar and these
[1:59:46] Crusades gets a follow-up visit every
[1:59:48] single one I could go on and on I didn't
[1:59:56] know I talked that long I could go on I
[1:59:59] could go on for hours hours and hours
[2:00:03] you know I'm an evangelist but I don't
[2:00:06] know a model of his missions I don't
[2:00:09] know if you call me a missionary
[2:00:10] whatever you want to call me but I love
[2:00:12] the mission field I'm getting old I
[2:00:17] don't know how many more times I can go
[2:00:20] my god help me to go to Pakistan one
[2:00:22] more time I'll just tell you this I'm
[2:00:27] going to close
[2:00:29] before we were going to Pakistan me and
[2:00:34] brother Clem went to make our passports
[2:00:38] in with the application and brother clam
[2:00:41] looked at his passport and said my
[2:00:43] passports expired he said you just go
[2:00:46] without me I said I'm not going if I get
[2:00:49] my head cut off you're gonna get your
[2:00:50] head cut off too that's probably not an
[2:00:58] exaggeration Amen God is good I could
[2:01:04] just keep telling you and telling you
[2:01:05] more and more and more and more but I'm
[2:01:07] gonna finish with this part here I had
[2:01:10] notes right here
[2:01:15] Isaiah 58 14 no weapon that is formed
[2:01:21] against me shall prosper every tongue
[2:01:25] shall write every tongue that shall rise
[2:01:28] against the in judgment that shall
[2:01:30] condemn this is the heritage of the
[2:01:35] servants of the Lord and the
[2:01:37] righteousness is of me sayeth the Lord
[2:01:42] for I am not ashamed of the gospel for
[2:01:48] it is the power of God unto salvation to
[2:01:51] every one that believeth but
[2:02:00] Brannon was he loved missions here he
[2:02:04] loved Africa he loved all those places
[2:02:07] he desired I want to go back there's
[2:02:10] something different about the mission
[2:02:12] feel something different than here and
[2:02:16] sometimes when I come back it's almost
[2:02:20] depressing
[2:02:22] because I don't see the I don't see the
[2:02:25] desire for soul here like it is there
[2:02:29] it's not the same he that when it snows
[2:02:33] is wise the righteous is a tree of life
[2:02:40] and he then what it shows is wise you
[2:02:44] are a tree of life to every unbeliever

[2:04:19] hallelujah hey Jesus when he sent up
[2:04:52] disciples he said whatever city entered
[2:04:54] they receive you eat such things
[2:04:57] yes God's Word will never return boy
[2:05:17] the Bible said men that have hazarded
[2:05:19] their lives their lives he said he
[2:05:38] didn't tell it this time but last time
[2:05:39] he said he'd have to preach so quiet
[2:05:41] because if they got loud the Muslim
[2:05:43] guards and other places and nearby
[2:05:45] buildings would hear him with guns they
[2:05:47] come in and kill him if they heard him
[2:05:49] singing so they'd have to get up to
[2:05:50] preach whispering they'd hazard their
[2:05:53] lives for denomination for money no for
