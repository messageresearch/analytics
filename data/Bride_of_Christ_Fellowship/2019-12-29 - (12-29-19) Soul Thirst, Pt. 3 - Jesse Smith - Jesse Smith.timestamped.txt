[41:30] Jesus said few will find that narrow
[41:33] road I just want to be one of those that
[41:36] can find it praise God and point
[41:38] everybody I know this is the way the
[41:40] word is the way you be the word is the
[41:42] way today
[41:43] praise God Hebrews 4:12 let's just read
[41:48] that together just verse 12 on three one
[41:51] two three for the word of God is quick
[41:54] and powerful and sharper than any
[41:58] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[42:01] dividing asunder of soul and spirit and
[42:05] of the joints and marrow and is a
[42:08] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[42:11] the heart it's that one more word
[42:12] prayer here as we bow our head god bless
[42:15] birthing let's bow our heads here for
[42:16] word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord we
[42:18] love you we've sang your songs Lord how
[42:20] they refresh our souls or I just feel
[42:23] such a emotional feeling right now of my
[42:27] love for you
[42:28] and I believe it's my soul Lord that
[42:31] wants to magnify the Lord so Lord we
[42:34] thank you that we can sing these songs
[42:35] and worship You Lord Jesus and I I'm
[42:38] reflecting I'm a little emotional on
[42:40] reflecting on this year
[42:42] you brought us through another year Lord
[42:44] and I'm grateful for that I'm still here
[42:46] I'm still healthy our families are still
[42:48] intact Lord God we have so much to be
[42:51] thankful for and praise God we give you
[42:54] glory for Jesus

[42:58] that the word received let it be
[43:00] received by your people Lord strengthen
[43:02] us to be ever more faithful ever more
[43:05] solid on the things of God the Bible
[43:08] cause it established in the faith Lord
[43:10] God that nothing can shake us Lord but
[43:12] Lord we will stand forever on the
[43:15] eternal truth of your word the
[43:16] revelation of the word and so father
[43:19] were grateful for it anoint us now for
[43:21] thy service anoint me I'm just you're
[43:23] yielded humble servant I'm nothing
[43:24] Lord God none of us are but we just
[43:27] asked for your leadership in this
[43:28] service in Jesus Christ's name
[43:30] the church said amen god bless you being
[43:32] seated praise God so we're happy to be
[43:39] here again we're thankful for another
[43:40] year I don't know if you saw the text
[43:42] but Tuesday we'll have another service
[43:44] for New Year's Eve and we'll do it Lord
[43:47] willing at 6 p.m. I hope that's ok and
[43:51] we'll follow it with Communion and feet
[43:54] washing now if you got to work I'm sorry
[43:56] I wish you didn't have to but if you can
[44:00] even just make it for the communion
[44:02] that's it I would encourage you to do
[44:03] that know a couple or a couple years ago
[44:06] I had a little discussion with someone
[44:08] who used to go to our church and you
[44:10] know they purposely skipped out on feet
[44:12] Washington Communion and I said that's I
[44:14] encouraged them I said you don't want to
[44:16] do that I said that that's coming up to
[44:20] your judgment you know that the Bible
[44:21] said examine yourselves and they were
[44:24] saying all these reasons why they
[44:26] shouldn't and
[44:26] said and I said even if there's
[44:29] something unsettling your life you
[44:31] should go try to settle it before
[44:33] communion and come to communion okay
[44:37] because it's your chance to show
[44:39] everyone that you're on the Lord's side
[44:41] and you're showing the Lord until he
[44:44] comes that you want to be associated
[44:45] with his death that he you believe that
[44:49] he died for you and so this person never
[44:54] really you know obeyed what I had asked
[44:58] them to do and so I don't know where
[45:00] they stand today I all I can say is I
[45:02] tried to help them but we don't want to
[45:04] take that lightly praise God we want to
[45:07] take it seriously and of course you know
[45:09] if you can't make it and I don't know
[45:10] about Wendy's schedule and I don't know
[45:12] about care and those who live far away
[45:13] but if you can make it praise God if not
[45:15] let me know I can reschedule or I can
[45:17] schedule another Lord's Supper soon by
[45:20] God's grace I happy happy to do that
[45:22] maybe in a couple weeks just let me know
[45:25] by the grace of the Lord so I like to
[45:32] recognize our other officers too brother
[45:35] bang can you come up here you can bring
[45:36] James with you can you come up here real
[45:38] quick I just want to give brother Van

[46:37] Saturday nights you know
[46:39] they devoted a lot of time and we've

[46:50] him little gift cards and things like
[46:51] that and I always want to thank our
[46:53] musicians and so this just a little
[46:56] token of our appreciation
[46:58] it just says thank you for your faithful
[47:00] service during 2019 so let's give them
[47:01] round paws praise God love you buddy so
[47:22] I'd like to usually do it at the
[47:23] beginning of the month of December but I
[47:25] kept holding off
[47:26] you know we had Simon come and then bend
[47:29] the rod and I was like I just want to
[47:31] wait till just the home folks are here
[47:32] you know I I love our visitors you know
[47:34] Simon's my family but I just want to
[47:37] thank our musicians and bang our officer
[47:42] with just us here by God's grace just to
[47:45] say thank you for everything that they
[47:47] do praise God
[47:50] just make sure I got everything here and
[47:53] as we head into 2019 can you switch over
[47:55] here real quick I was going through this
[48:00] with my family we we finished the book
[48:01] that we are reading at home and and now
[48:06] we're into the Seventh Seal book so I
[48:09] just want to this is mainly for me I
[48:12] just want to remind you just about our
[48:16] reverence in the house of the Lord you
[48:19] know so when we went to brown Tabernacle
[48:21] you'll see the there's two signs and
[48:23] they were there since the 60s you know
[48:25] they haven't changed anything from when
[48:27] brother Branham was there other than the
[48:30] outside parking lot and everything like
[48:32] that they've changed a little bit
[48:33] so just remember I was telling this to
[48:35] my children today or this week of while
[48:37] we were going through over or the the
[48:39] Seventh Seal book says entering the
[48:41] house Lord reverently in prayer
[48:43] meditation mother BAM said just try to
[48:44] come in as quietly as we can and pray
[48:48] and meditate he said so people can hear
[48:51] from God
[48:52] praise the Lord and then on the other
[48:54] right next to it is another one please
[48:56] do not talk be reverent pray study or
[48:59] meditate
[48:59] praise the Lord so just to remind it's
[49:01] mainly for me like you know sometimes
[49:03] I'll start brother amen and Jose usually
[49:05] it's me talking to you guys so I'm doing
[49:08] this for my sake so I got a little loose
[49:11] on this so I want to make sure that
[49:12] after service
[49:14] you know I shake your hand we greet each
[49:16] other but if we want to talk at length
[49:18] I've got to take it out there you know
[49:20] unless it's counseling or something like
[49:22] that if I'm going to counsel with
[49:23] somebody you have a question I want to
[49:24] try to help you we can talk in the
[49:26] sanctuary that's fine
[49:27] but sometimes in the past I've been
[49:29] guilty of just how are you doing brother
[49:31] what's this what's going on with this or
[49:33] that it's not really counseling I'm just
[49:35] talking with people so forgive me you
[49:38] know I want to do better job on that by
[49:40] God's grace and then then it's kind of
[49:45] at the brown Tabernacle you can see it
[49:47] how it says be still and know that I'm
[49:49] God they got that up there at the front
[49:53] and and you know brother Bram said he
[49:56] always wanted that crucifix right there
[49:59] of Jesus he said because on the right
[50:02] hand of Jesus was the saved thief and so
[50:05] that's what that one represents about
[50:07] RAM said I'm happy to be on the right
[50:09] side of the Lord in other words I'm
[50:12] happy that he saved me so brother Ram
[50:15] looked at himself and said I'm the
[50:16] guilty one I'm the one who needs saved
[50:18] and I want to be on the right hand of
[50:20] the Lord praise God so that's just a
[50:22] beautiful picture there and right when
[50:26] you walk in the tabernacle there's this
[50:27] huge this is a massive picture and it
[50:30] looks small here but it's massive it's
[50:33] probably bigger than this TV actually if
[50:36] maybe it is the size of TVs return to
[50:37] this way somebody gave that picture to
[50:40] brother Branham so that was that's been
[50:42] the tabernacle for years and years and
[50:44] years but just thought I'd show some of
[50:46] those things that's me I got Jose I
[50:49] think you took that picture buddy thank
[50:50] you sir I just want to show those real
[50:53] quick we're just thankful for all God
[50:57] has done so
[51:00] to look at this thought here and I'm
[51:01] gonna send timers I don't preach all day
[51:03] I want to be respectful of the time and
[51:06] everything make sure I got everything
[51:09] okay so I want to look here at the the
[51:14] soul and preach on this amazing part of
[51:21] each one of us it's our part that's most
[51:24] like God praise the Lord we know we're
[51:27] in the image of God God made Adam in His
[51:30] image and when God made Adam he made him
[51:33] spirit being right he started off and
[51:35] the Bible's brother Branham says Adam
[51:38] and Eve were one spirit so can you
[51:40] imagine that like one spirit and they
[51:42] both had human spirits and souls so it
[51:45] was like two souls as one one beam no
[51:48] that's I can't explain that he said but
[51:51] that was one spirit and that spirit was
[51:53] leading the animals right but then God
[51:57] put he you know God put flesh on that
[51:59] spirit or soul and then in Adam was both
[52:04] male and female male and female then God
[52:08] saw that Adam was alone he felt alone in
[52:12] his own self and so God put him to sleep
[52:15] and did the first surgery pulled out the
[52:17] eat the rib and made Eve from the rib
[52:20] and then Eve had her own soul Eve had
[52:24] her own body and so Adam had his own
[52:27] soul and his own body praise God
[52:30] and God said he said you're in my image
[52:34] and my likeness praise God and just as
[52:37] God his father son Holy Ghost so are we
[52:39] so body spirit praise God when you look
[52:43] at God you don't see three persons we
[52:46] only see one person praise God and so it
[52:49] is how you and I are in the image of God
[52:51] we are three parts but where one person
[52:55] praise God and so this is what's been
[53:00] revelation to me because I've never
[53:03] understood this before and the Bible
[53:06] says search if we're not growing in
[53:08] knowledge of the word something's wrong
[53:10] if we're not growing in Revelation it's
[53:13] because we're not
[53:14] asking for it because our number one
[53:16] prayer is God reveal yourself to me
[53:20] right give me more revelation and so
[53:25] that should be our main prayer Lord I
[53:27] want to grow in grace and knowledge of
[53:29] you praise God
[53:33] yeah we all want to grow in power I
[53:35] don't think anybody here desires more
[53:37] than me to see miracles every morning
[53:39] with amen
[53:39] I'm on my knees in my closet saying God
[53:42] let's signs wonders and miracles be done
[53:44] by the name of your Holy Child Jesus I
[53:46] don't I don't know if anybody wants them
[53:48] more than I do if you do well then
[53:50] praise God but nobody I just pray for
[53:55] him all the time amen but I realized
[53:58] that I can't make God do anything but I
[54:02] can but what we can do is ask God for
[54:04] more revelation of himself praise God
[54:07] and we can grow and we can learn to love
[54:10] God and and what God does as time passes
[54:12] will thank the Lord for it we'll keep
[54:15] believing but we have to remember that
[54:17] Jesus told Thomas he said blessed is he
[54:20] who hasn't seen yet beliefs so whether I
[54:23] even though I haven't seen somebody
[54:25] physically raised from the dead
[54:27] I believe God does it amen hallelujah
[54:30] even though I've never seen anybody bit
[54:32] by a snake a poisonous venomous snake
[54:35] and then recover I still believe it
[54:37] praise God hallelujah
[54:39] but they got we have laid our hands on
[54:41] the sick and they have recovered amen
[54:43] I've recovered amen from my sicknesses
[54:46] God has healed me supernaturally praise
[54:48] God
[54:48] where should not have happened God did
[54:50] it and so we're thankful for what God
[54:53] has done and I constantly wrestled with
[54:55] that you know wanting to see more of God
[54:57] but I've got to remember that if God's
[54:59] choosing you know taught to do all these
[55:02] things or more of these things and we're
[55:04] waiting on God's timing there is a way
[55:06] to grow and that is through revelation
[55:09] of God's Word and prevent makes it plain
[55:12] says those who have the Holy Ghost will
[55:14] be in the word all the way that's one
[55:18] great sign that we're born again when we
[55:21] hunger for more of the word we want more
[55:24] supernatural we want more we want more
[55:27] the church of course we want the church
[55:29] to grow but above all we want more of
[55:32] the word we want to understand and live
[55:35] and obey more of the word hallelujah
[55:39] because remember the Bible says there
[55:44] will come a time when they will not
[55:46] endure sound doctrine and there were so
[55:50] there'll be a time at the end Jesus said
[55:52] few there be that find it the deceivers
[55:54] are wax worse and worse there is coming
[55:57] the time and the time is near it's
[55:59] happening now amongst our ranks as
[56:01] brother Ben was saying last week that
[56:03] many people are leaving the message and
[56:06] saying brother Branham is not a prophet
[56:08] anymore
[56:09] and they're entitled to that but the
[56:13] Bible said the prophesied of this time
[56:16] there's coming a great falling away
[56:18] first before the Anti Christ can be
[56:22] revealed there's going to be a falling
[56:25] away from people that were the people of
[56:27] God and they're gonna fall away from the
[56:30] sound doctrine or the Word of God praise
[56:34] God and then of course they'll reject
[56:35] God's messengers and not just brother
[56:38] Branham but all of the fivefold ministry
[56:40] the true fivefold ministry because
[56:42] they're rejecting the word or the
[56:45] doctrine or the instruction that the
[56:47] real men of God are preaching okay so
[56:52] it's gonna go like that not only are
[56:53] they gonna reject brother Branham but
[56:55] they're gonna reject the doctrine that
[56:57] he taught and that's what's more
[56:59] important remember that what's most
[57:01] important is the doctrine which is the
[57:03] revelation of God's Word because John
[57:07] the Baptist said I must decrease but he
[57:09] must increase amen
[57:11] and church as time goes on let me just
[57:14] say a few words about this as time goes
[57:16] on people are finding more and more
[57:18] faults or mistakes of brother Branham
[57:21] but I have yet to find any mistakes with
[57:24] thus saith the Lord there are a few
[57:27] arguments that people are going to make
[57:29] and there's things that I will share
[57:31] coming up in the next few weeks Lord
[57:33] willing I'm gonna preach on this I'm
[57:34] gonna call this series prove all things
[57:38] because if we've got the truth we can
[57:40] prove everything by the word we're not
[57:42] scared of any question we're not scared
[57:44] of any person leaving us or any person
[57:47] calling us unbelievers or any person
[57:49] mocking us or making fun of us if we've
[57:51] got the word then the word will prove
[57:54] that itself is true praise God and it's
[57:57] this if the doctrine of it praise God
[57:59] okay so just so you know I'll be sharing
[58:02] it and maybe once the livestream goes
[58:04] off I'll be sharing that there's people
[58:06] close to us that we know that may be
[58:10] falling away from believing brother
[58:11] Graham was a prophet but that doesn't
[58:13] shake me because this whole time my
[58:17] whole if you just go on my YouTube page
[58:19] my whole time the whole time my whole
[58:21] vision was to give people the word and
[58:25] then yes I did make brother Ram videos
[58:27] but the majority is not about brother
[58:29] Ram brother branham because he's not the
[58:32] one that's supposed to increase in this
[58:34] day Jesus Christ the word is to increase
[58:37] amen he's the one that's going to
[58:40] increase praise God and I believe
[58:43] brother Ram was God's prophet and but
[58:46] yet I can recognize where he made
[58:48] mistakes and his doctrine he changes
[58:50] predictions he made his own personal
[58:52] opinions or maybe he compromised in a
[58:55] weak moment but I cannot find where he
[58:58] ever compromised or was wrong with thus
[59:00] saith the Lord and I know there's be
[59:03] there'll be people that will argue with
[59:04] me on that and I'm going to debate some
[59:06] Lord willing soon but that's kind of
[59:09] where we're at right now isn't it look
[59:10] we're at church we got we've got the the
[59:12] Jeffersonville side where they're
[59:14] worshiping brother Branham and now we
[59:16] got a sign of people that they like the
[59:18] word of it but they don't want brother
[59:19] Branham so here we are where are we
[59:22] right in the middle of the road hey hey
[59:24] oh yeah we don't worship gods man we are
[59:27] their gods man because the Bible said we
[59:29] give all honor to all men of God but we
[59:33] also don't reject him because he was
[59:36] human or made mistakes what we do is we
[59:39] go through what's what the questions are
[59:40] and we point everybody back to the Word
[59:43] of God that he taught amen
[59:45] because the falling away is from the
[59:48] doctrine they and that's what the Holy
[59:51] Spirit told brother Branham amen that's
[59:54] what he wrote in the paper and put it in
[59:56] the other corner so in the Browns a
[59:58] vertical there will come a time when
[1:00:00] they will not endure sound doctrine so
[1:00:04] the attack is going to be on the
[1:00:06] doctrine that we hold specifically
[1:00:10] brother Jose you know it holiness the
[1:00:14] doctrine of holiness because what we
[1:00:18] have said though the Word of God is
[1:00:20] God's filter and program says over and
[1:00:22] over again in the first message you
[1:00:24] cannot bring sin through God's filter so
[1:00:29] the great deception the Antichrist will
[1:00:31] he will head this up but the great
[1:00:33] deception of the false church uniting
[1:00:36] with the government is that they will
[1:00:38] make a false group and they will still
[1:00:41] be living in unrighteousness let me say
[1:00:44] it again unrighteousness not
[1:00:46] righteousness but unrighteousness in
[1:00:50] other words it's called lisent Ischia
[1:00:52] sness licentiousness which is I'm sorry
[1:00:56] lasciviousness which means a lawlessness
[1:00:59] they will turn the grace of God into
[1:01:02] lawlessness they can live and enjoy sit
[1:01:05] and still think they're a church member
[1:01:07] or going to heaven but the Word of God
[1:01:09] says when you've got the seal of God
[1:01:11] that you depart from all iniquity praise
[1:01:14] God so it's going to boil down to this
[1:01:19] church doctrine and are you surprised
[1:01:22] when Ram said what the only difference
[1:01:24] between Moses and Balaam was doctrine
[1:01:27] praise God but Ram said the Antichrist
[1:01:31] spirit moon will reject the true bride
[1:01:35] doctrine so that's what it's going to
[1:01:38] come down to I'm a sardine klaris larkin
[1:01:40] for those Abbott studying Clarence
[1:01:42] Clarence Larkin this week he books are
[1:01:44] free online umbrella ran used a lot of
[1:01:46] Clarence Larkin Satan's Superman
[1:01:50] that's from Clarence Larkin the future
[1:01:52] home that's from Clarence Larkin praise
[1:01:55] God
[1:01:55] program use a lot of his teachings
[1:01:58] but listen when it came down to the
[1:02:01] revelation of when it was and the seals
[1:02:04] it was all different brother rhythm his
[1:02:08] revelations were fresh from God and they
[1:02:10] were different than Clarence Larkins
[1:02:13] remember brother Branham was like Elisha
[1:02:16] the altar was all broken down there at
[1:02:19] the time when the fire was going to fall
[1:02:21] Amen hallelujah and there's all these
[1:02:24] stones and how to worship laying around
[1:02:26] and they're just all laying there and
[1:02:28] Elijah had to take one at a time and
[1:02:30] restock them and put them in rye the
[1:02:33] right order praise God and that's what
[1:02:35] brother Branham would do he would take
[1:02:36] some from Larkin he would take some from
[1:02:38] your eyes Smith he would take some from
[1:02:40] the Holy Ghost amen he would take some
[1:02:42] from the angel of the Lord amen and he
[1:02:44] would stack them all together and when
[1:02:46] they all finally got together at the
[1:02:48] showdown then the fire fell praise God
[1:02:51] but it says that fire falling time is
[1:02:54] the latter rain praise God it is the
[1:02:58] final showdown
[1:02:59] everybody said the rapture showdown will
[1:03:02] be between Jesus and denominations Amen
[1:03:05] so we'll have Jesus doctrine the
[1:03:08] restored doctrine also 12 stones amen
[1:03:12] I like that day men all 12 stones all
[1:03:17] placed back together because remember he
[1:03:19] was restoring the hearts
[1:03:22] he was restoring and I just shall come
[1:03:25] and restore all things jesus said in
[1:03:28] Matthew 17 11 he's coming to restore all
[1:03:31] that the Reformers had lost he was
[1:03:34] putting it back together and he put it
[1:03:36] back together so the fire could fall
[1:03:38] that's what we're seeing today praise
[1:03:41] God but many will not endure the sound
[1:03:44] doctrine oh I'm so glad I believe the
[1:03:48] doctrine of this message praise God
[1:03:49] hallelujah
[1:03:52] so Church I understand that many are
[1:03:55] going to be questioning and falling away
[1:03:57] I'm getting questions you know from
[1:03:59] friends and coach ones but I'm happy to
[1:04:03] defend what we believe because what we
[1:04:05] believe comes right from God's Word I've
[1:04:07] never been happier to know that I've
[1:04:09] tried to take by the leader or the
[1:04:11] leadership of the Holy Spirit to
[1:04:12] take everything I believe back to the
[1:04:14] word because the word is what's
[1:04:18] ultimately going to come down to praise
[1:04:20] God it's going to come down to the
[1:04:22] doctrine of the word praise God and God
[1:04:25] but have said the last vindication of
[1:04:27] the seven church age messenger will be
[1:04:30] the bride being raptured off to earth
[1:04:32] because that will prove she had received
[1:04:34] Jesus's message thank the Lord amen
[1:04:39] the last indication is that the bride
[1:04:42] who kept the doctrine of Christ Christ
[1:04:44] will rapture her off the earth amen now
[1:04:49] our text was Hebrews for twelve years
[1:04:52] like when you're gonna get to your text
[1:04:53] mother Jesse we get to right now Hebrews
[1:04:56] 4:12 now I want you to notice here that
[1:05:06] the Bible said the Word of God is quick
[1:05:09] that means alive powerful and sharper
[1:05:13] than any two-edged sword piercing now
[1:05:17] remember the Bible said they were
[1:05:18] pierced on the day of Pentecost remember
[1:05:20] that their hearts were pricked actually
[1:05:22] said pricked so see Peters preaching the
[1:05:25] word a church we should feel that every
[1:05:28] service we should feel a prick like the
[1:05:30] Holy Spirit saying ah it's cutting me I
[1:05:33] need to do this I need to follow the
[1:05:35] Lord's leading in this is that right
[1:05:36] Church because we all have mind battles
[1:05:40] we all have you know temptations of the
[1:05:41] flesh
[1:05:42] there's always something where sins got
[1:05:43] a punch on us and we need God to help us
[1:05:46] overcome that so it's the Word of God is
[1:05:49] quick powerful sharper than a two-edged
[1:05:51] sword piercing even is dividing asunder
[1:05:53] of soul and spirit and of the joints of
[1:05:55] the marrow and is a discerner or judge
[1:05:57] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:06:01] now notice it is the word that divides
[1:06:05] the soul from the spirit now Moran tells
[1:06:10] us plainly
[1:06:10] he said that the soul is the nature of
[1:06:14] the human spirit and that means your
[1:06:18] soul is your will the nature is your
[1:06:22] will or your desire
[1:06:25] your soul is the the desire of your
[1:06:28] spirit right your spirit is your
[1:06:31] consciousness I'm here right now I'm
[1:06:33] here right now right but something is
[1:06:36] guiding my thoughts it's my soul my
[1:06:38] desire guides my thoughts right but the
[1:06:42] reality is your mind is out your mind is
[1:06:44] open the battlefield the greatest
[1:06:46] battlefield and Satan has free access in
[1:06:49] your mind so he will introduce a thought
[1:06:53] in your mind and if we're not careful
[1:06:55] we'll entertain the wrong thought but
[1:06:58] we've got to take that thought and judge
[1:07:00] it by the learn by the desire of the
[1:07:04] soul praise God because that's what the
[1:07:07] word does it judges it pierces and
[1:07:11] divides soul and spirit so the word
[1:07:16] first of all church the word will reveal
[1:07:19] the location of your battle where's your
[1:07:22] battle taking place like Amen was sick
[1:07:25] last week where was his battle in his
[1:07:27] body the word tells us that right now if
[1:07:32] were you having a mind battle - yes
[1:07:33] memory told me don't you have a mind
[1:07:35] matter when you're sick I God did I do
[1:07:37] something wrong that's some of my
[1:07:38] hardest my battles is when I'm sick
[1:07:40] brother may God have I done wrong if I
[1:07:42] sinned against the Lord but see the word
[1:07:45] divides that the word shows you the
[1:07:48] location where's my battle praise God
[1:07:52] and then the word if the word first
[1:07:55] shows the location of your battle is it
[1:07:58] in the body the mind or the soul and
[1:08:01] then the word helps you judge that
[1:08:04] thought or that disease or that sickness
[1:08:08] the word will judge it praise God Amen
[1:08:12] the Lord will judge is this the right
[1:08:14] thing is this the wrong thing do I want
[1:08:17] this or should I not have this Amen the
[1:08:21] word then judges that for example if
[1:08:24] someone says well I'm having a mind
[1:08:25] battle brother Jesse how many ever been
[1:08:26] there and there's I hope you understand
[1:08:30] there's times you have mind battles and
[1:08:32] it's not a struggle in your soul like
[1:08:36] your will it's just like a
[1:08:38] it's like a thoughtless is this the
[1:08:39] right thought or not you're not
[1:08:41] concerned about going to hell or
[1:08:43] anything like that or am i outside the
[1:08:45] will of God you're just having a mind
[1:08:46] metal I wonder if this is the right
[1:08:48] thing to do whatever I should say this
[1:08:49] to the brother or sister it's just a
[1:08:51] mind battle right and you can see that
[1:08:55] that the Bible tells us in cyclins 10-5
[1:08:58] passing down imaginations well I'm just
[1:09:01] imagining that bang was I was imagining
[1:09:03] both Jessie was this see we're just
[1:09:05] imagining things right but the Bible
[1:09:08] said cast sit down and every high thing
[1:09:10] that exalts itself against the knowledge
[1:09:13] of God amen
[1:09:14] see why knowledge is so important we got
[1:09:17] to grow in knowledge because Satan's
[1:09:18] going to bring knowledge that comes
[1:09:20] against God's knowledge so we have to
[1:09:24] know God's knowledge so we can cast down
[1:09:26] the world's knowledge or Satan's
[1:09:29] knowledge and bringing in the captivity
[1:09:32] so there's rests that me that made that
[1:09:35] need done in our minds we the Holy
[1:09:38] Spirit to be the police officer in our
[1:09:41] minds to arrest the evil thoughts and
[1:09:44] send them to jail praise God
[1:09:46] amen bring it into captivity don't let
[1:09:51] it make you a captive make the thought a
[1:09:54] captive and send it to jail send it back
[1:09:57] to Satan learning from praise God Amen
[1:10:01] I'm gonna die or I'm useless or I'm
[1:10:03] nobody you've got to take that thought
[1:10:05] don't let that thought make you a slave
[1:10:08] you make that thought your slave and
[1:10:10] reject it because your weapons are not
[1:10:14] wimpy your weapons are mighty through
[1:10:17] the pulling down of strongholds amen
[1:10:19] glory the Word of God is the mightiest
[1:10:23] weapon God could ever give us we just
[1:10:25] gotta use it all the time amen
[1:10:27] hallelujah it takes in the captivity it
[1:10:31] makes that thought asleep and then it
[1:10:33] sends a slave out to its master the
[1:10:35] devil praise God amen and every thought
[1:10:40] to the obedience of Christ what does
[1:10:45] that the word the word helps you locate
[1:10:48] oh this is a mind battle I've got to
[1:10:50] cast this down
[1:10:52] this is going to cast me down into the
[1:10:53] the depths of depression and the church
[1:10:55] said or the depths of fear or the depths
[1:10:59] of lust brothers right that's often when
[1:11:01] we battle so much the depths of lust
[1:11:04] it'll cast us down it'll come and try to
[1:11:07] come into our house and and lock us up
[1:11:09] and try to make us a slave to that well
[1:11:12] I can't do anything unless I get this
[1:11:14] relief or I can't do anything unless I
[1:11:16] get this high right like the drug
[1:11:18] addicts do and all these things like
[1:11:20] that
[1:11:20] people those thoughts have to be brought
[1:11:23] into captivity to Christ I used to think
[1:11:27] that way I've got to have a tobacco
[1:11:29] before I can go to bed or I can't sleep
[1:11:31] I used to have those thoughts or I've
[1:11:33] got to watch that game or I've got to
[1:11:35] watch that dirty movie before I do this
[1:11:37] I said and it used to be so overpowering
[1:11:39] that I was a slave to that but at one
[1:11:43] point I don't know how it's like a man
[1:11:45] who went to sleep and he planted the
[1:11:46] seed and he woke up and it had already
[1:11:48] shot up somehow one of those services
[1:11:50] God calls growth in my life and in my
[1:11:53] mind I was able now to take the word and
[1:11:56] make that thought captive and I no
[1:11:58] longer thought I was a captive or an
[1:12:00] addict to those things but now I was
[1:12:03] ruling over that spirit and I can't make
[1:12:05] that spirit captive and I could own that
[1:12:08] spirit to go and it left in the name of
[1:12:10] Jesus praise God I don't know how it
[1:12:16] happened but as you feed on the Lord God
[1:12:19] causes this unknown growth amen this
[1:12:22] unseen growth phrase God so it reveals
[1:12:29] the location the word tells you where
[1:12:31] this is at
[1:12:33] and also then judges what to do about it
[1:12:41] so church you all know okay that's just
[1:12:43] some mind battle you all know what it
[1:12:44] feels like just have a mind battle now
[1:12:48] here's the deepest one the deepest one
[1:12:50] you can have is soul searching see
[1:12:55] brother aim
[1:12:56] I'm really searching my soul right now
[1:12:59] that's that's really saying something
[1:13:01] don't get me wrong you can lose your
[1:13:03] mind too and someone could lose their
[1:13:04] mind that's that's serious students
[1:13:06] program so you can have the seal the
[1:13:08] Holy Ghost and lose your mind look at
[1:13:09] some of these Saints like I don't know
[1:13:12] if I should call names man anyways
[1:13:14] there's people in the message I've
[1:13:15] served God for 50 years but they get old
[1:13:17] they get dementia and their mind leaves
[1:13:20] but their whole life or the aim and they
[1:13:22] were faithful they paid their ties they
[1:13:24] went to church they spoke in tongues
[1:13:25] they shouted they danced they love they
[1:13:27] read the Bible but they were sealed but
[1:13:31] then their mind starts to slip and then
[1:13:34] they say things you would never ever
[1:13:36] hear them say does that make their soul
[1:13:40] is their will desire different now no no
[1:13:43] no that's why God made a seal and not to
[1:13:49] the next revival or not they're just 85
[1:13:51] years old but it's until you get a new
[1:13:54] body amen hallelujah that's what they
[1:13:58] didn't have in the Old Testament didn't
[1:13:59] have the seal in the soul that's what
[1:14:02] made the New Testament a testament of
[1:14:04] better promises amen
[1:14:05] a Testament where you can have a new
[1:14:07] heart a new spirit and God's Spirit amen
[1:14:16] so Satan can attack this flesh here but
[1:14:22] there's times where battles can reach
[1:14:25] here and you'll say I'm searching my
[1:14:28] soul brother Jesse sometimes I do that
[1:14:32] too don't you sometimes you have a soul
[1:14:35] shaking moment where are the temptations
[1:14:39] of this world or allowed to shake you to
[1:14:41] the your very core brother Ram did
[1:14:46] remember that when he lost his wife and
[1:14:48] is a daughter Satan said you're
[1:14:51] preaching divine healing and God didn't
[1:14:53] heal your wife you're preaching divine
[1:14:55] healing God in here here heal Sharon
[1:14:57] rose but Abraham said I was about ready
[1:14:59] to quit because the devil said he
[1:15:03] doesn't love you and he said
[1:15:07] just right before I quit look at this
[1:15:09] Seoul mine he was just gonna change his
[1:15:11] desire but right brother I said right
[1:15:13] before I just was gonna say I won't then
[1:15:15] I won't serve anymore
[1:15:16] he said that anchor held honey there
[1:15:22] yeah and he said the word came yeah see
[1:15:25] the word located where the battle was it
[1:15:28] was at his very core not just a mind
[1:15:31] battle on hunt you see I went deeper
[1:15:34] than that down to his the will his
[1:15:35] desire to serve God and he said but the
[1:15:39] acres hold and then the word judged that
[1:15:42] thought and the word said where did you
[1:15:45] get your children and your wife anyway
[1:15:47] the Lord gives and the Lord takes away
[1:15:50] blessed be the name of the Lord amen so
[1:15:55] the word judge that thought and brought
[1:15:59] it in the captivity head and chaos and
[1:16:02] no because why it's lighter than the
[1:16:05] depressive thoughts Amen
[1:16:07] it's mightier than quitting thoughts
[1:16:09] it's mine you're been doubts the Word of
[1:16:12] God is more powerful it's quick its
[1:16:15] activist living and it gives you this
[1:16:17] heart of your heart which is the love
[1:16:19] and serve God amen glory hallelujah he
[1:16:28] was searching his soul see and I've
[1:16:37] preached this before but if you go to
[1:16:38] first Peter 2:11 don't just leave that
[1:16:41] up there Keisha
[1:16:42] the Bible said dearly know yeah first
[1:16:49] 2:11 if you've got your Bibles dearly
[1:16:51] beloved I beseech you as strangers and
[1:16:54] pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts
[1:16:57] which war against the soul this is why
[1:17:04] people can have their names blotted off
[1:17:06] the book of life because just like a
[1:17:09] ground a soul can receive the faith seen
[1:17:12] but if that faith seed doesn't produce
[1:17:16] fruit it's not born again praise God
[1:17:21] that's right by the Amen when people
[1:17:23] that they receive the message but
[1:17:24] they're not born again they'll get a
[1:17:26] temptation especially with relationships
[1:17:28] well my wife left me and they have a
[1:17:31] choice or my husband left me and of a
[1:17:35] choice I've got a fleshly lust I want to
[1:17:37] be married to somebody I don't want to
[1:17:38] be alone it's such a fleshly battle or
[1:17:41] maybe some people it's with alcohol my
[1:17:43] drunkenness and it just it goes deeper
[1:17:48] than a mind battle this is this is just
[1:17:50] more than just well sometimes I battle
[1:17:53] fighting this in my mind it goes all the
[1:17:54] way down to their soul and for Judas
[1:17:58] Church can you imagine us he was saved
[1:18:00] the Bible said the disciples believed in
[1:18:02] Christ
[1:18:03] Judas baptized people because he was
[1:18:05] baptized in John chapter 4 the Bible
[1:18:09] says that the Bible said Jesus was
[1:18:11] standing with the twelve and the 70 and
[1:18:14] he said they'd come back rejoicing and
[1:18:16] he said don't rejoice that you got power
[1:18:18] to cast out devils he said rejoice that
[1:18:21] your names are written in heaven amen
[1:18:23] praise God and Judas his name was there
[1:18:27] but M says in the church age book but
[1:18:30] when he sold out Jesus Christ at that
[1:18:35] supper the Bible said when he lived it
[1:18:40] when he left that word it's as if the
[1:18:43] seed of God died the Word of God died in
[1:18:47] his heart when he left that word his
[1:18:51] name was blotted off the book of life it
[1:18:53] had to been just like Dan and Ephraim
[1:18:57] Dan and Ephraim were blotted out and
[1:18:58] listen not in heaven but under heaven
[1:19:03] I can't explain that but that's what the
[1:19:04] Bible says why were they brought it up
[1:19:08] for idolatry they set up idols why was
[1:19:12] Judas running out idolatry he idolized
[1:19:15] money and he wanted money in his soul he
[1:19:20] had a greater desire to go out and get
[1:19:22] thirty pieces of silver than to go to
[1:19:24] the cross with Christ greater desire and
[1:19:31] it was a soul this fleshly lusts of the
[1:19:35] money got past his mind past all the
[1:19:38] miracles past all that he's seen all the
[1:19:40] people he baptized he let it go deeper
[1:19:42] and deeper until it ward in his soul and
[1:19:45] that seed that just started to spring up
[1:19:48] through justification sanctification the
[1:19:50] Bible said it died because it fell on
[1:19:53] stony ground and it never produced
[1:19:57] anything nothing and that's why Peter
[1:20:03] says you can have fleshly lusts that war
[1:20:06] against the soul and we see it today
[1:20:08] people leave the message so they can get
[1:20:10] married twice or two or three times but
[1:20:12] the Bible said adulterers and
[1:20:14] fornicators will not inherit the kingdom
[1:20:17] of God so they choose fleshly lusts they
[1:20:21] lost the battle in their soul but I'm so
[1:20:23] happy to know that you and I are here as
[1:20:26] testimony as witnesses that the armor of
[1:20:30] God that he's given us is powerful
[1:20:33] enough to withstand every battle the
[1:20:35] soul and that we can be more than
[1:20:37] conquerors as soldiers fully armored
[1:20:39] soldiers with the word of the Lord
[1:20:43] hallelujah thank the Lord Jesus there
[1:20:54] was a battle one time in acts 13 verse 6
[1:20:56] there's a battle for a soul
[1:21:04] so God led Paul to speak blindness upon
[1:21:09] a sorcerer how many more that battle
[1:21:14] thirteen six and when they had gone
[1:21:16] through the isle of hey folks
[1:21:19] they found a certain sorcerer a false
[1:21:20] prophet a Jew whose name was bar Jesus
[1:21:23] look how close that is the Jesus he's so
[1:21:26] closely to see the very elective or
[1:21:27] possible which was with the deputy of
[1:21:29] the country Sergius Paulus look how
[1:21:33] close he is to Paul Paulus a prudent man
[1:21:37] who called for a Barnabas and saw and
[1:21:38] desired to hear desire amen
[1:21:41] there's the desire there's the soul Ivan
[1:21:45] desire to go to church I'm a desire to
[1:21:47] hear what that man is preaching that's
[1:21:48] assault
[1:21:49] a men the soul is thirsty every song
[1:21:52] thirsty that has a word of God amen
[1:21:55] and that person either chooses there's a
[1:21:59] there's a holy thirst here somewhere and
[1:22:02] the freedom or NCS either hush that say
[1:22:05] shut up be quiet
[1:22:06] don't go listen to preaching don't
[1:22:08] believe the preacher or it says go ahead
[1:22:10] receive it receive life receive the
[1:22:14] refreshing waters of life amen
[1:22:16] receive the bread of God for your soul
[1:22:19] praise the Lord receive the desires of
[1:22:22] your heart he said I desire to hear
[1:22:28] God's Word but II limas the sorcerer for
[1:22:34] so is his name by interpretation without
[1:22:37] withstood them seeking to turn away the
[1:22:40] deputy from the faith the soul see faith
[1:22:42] in faith or unbelief the soul starts by
[1:22:44] receiving justification justification is
[1:22:47] that seed where they get saved now
[1:22:48] they've got the seed they've just got to
[1:22:51] keep watering that seat until produces
[1:22:53] fruit praise God
[1:22:54] hey man that word is the see the face
[1:22:59] seed then saw who's also called Paul
[1:23:03] filled with the Holy Ghost set his eyes
[1:23:05] on him and said o full of all subtlety
[1:23:08] and on mischief now child of the devil
[1:23:10] now enemy of all righteousness wilt thou
[1:23:12] not cease to pervert the right ways of
[1:23:14] the Lord and now behold the hand
[1:23:17] the Lord is upon thee and thou shalt be
[1:23:18] blind not seeing the Sun for a season
[1:23:20] and immediately there fell on him a mist
[1:23:22] and a darkness and he went about seeking
[1:23:25] some to lead him by the hand then the
[1:23:28] deputy when he saw what was done
[1:23:29] believed being astonished at the
[1:23:31] doctrine of the Lord a hand remember
[1:23:36] Paul could not have done this unless it
[1:23:38] was the deputy's desire to serve God in
[1:23:41] other words you cannot you and I cannot
[1:23:44] force people to come to church but see
[1:23:48] pause will got lined up with God's will
[1:23:50] but also got lined up with the deputies
[1:23:52] will and so when he spoke blindness upon
[1:23:55] illness it happened because they all
[1:23:57] desired it it was everybody's desire is
[1:23:59] God's desire Paul's desire and the
[1:24:01] deputy's desire and it all lined up and
[1:24:04] God did a supernatural work in order to
[1:24:06] give that soul the desire of its heart
[1:24:12] see the word discern that the word
[1:24:15] discerned to Paul well this man desires
[1:24:17] the word I've got to judge that spirit
[1:24:21] that's on limas I'm gonna judge it in
[1:24:25] rebuke it and curse it amen praise the
[1:24:29] Lord a church you got to have we you and
[1:24:33] I you and I gotta have this confidence
[1:24:34] when God wants us to do something like
[1:24:36] that we'll be so anointed we won't even
[1:24:37] doubt it those times in my prayer closet
[1:24:41] when I spoke into the spirits I've
[1:24:43] spoken to the different ones who
[1:24:45] couldn't have babies I wasn't even
[1:24:46] thinking about it I just was so anointed
[1:24:48] I spoke it and it happened they men and
[1:24:52] that's how we know but see we got to be
[1:24:54] so annoyed in the flesh and the spirit
[1:24:56] and the soul that we're so lined up
[1:24:58] everything's lined up that God's will
[1:25:00] can flow right through all of them
[1:25:01] praise God no the little pipes are
[1:25:04] clogged up praise God
[1:25:05] nothing's closed up you're not feeding
[1:25:08] their lust of the flesh you're not
[1:25:09] thinking about evil thoughts you're
[1:25:11] thinking about God's thoughts and your
[1:25:12] soul is to do the will of God when all
[1:25:15] that gets lined up God can move amen
[1:25:17] that's when something gets done real BAM
[1:25:20] says holiday yeah in that beautiful and
[1:25:27] Lord willing I'll be preaching oneness
[1:25:28] in the future but the word divides
[1:25:31] asunder soul spirit and body so there's

[1:26:09] those are soul-searching moments Church
[1:26:12] we listen we are at a soul-searching
[1:26:15] moment around this message people are
[1:26:18] searching their souls and they're either
[1:26:20] going to go worship brother Branham or
[1:26:22] they're going to go out of the world or
[1:26:23] they're gonna stay right in the middle
[1:26:24] of the road and only worship Jesus
[1:26:27] Christ that's where I'm gonna go praise
[1:26:30] the Lord Amen hallelujah that's right
[1:26:35] now the Bible calls this if you wanna
[1:26:37] know this this was made real to me this
[1:26:39] week as I was setting away on the Lord
[1:26:41] it's like it fell from heaven the Bible
[1:26:42] calls soul searching this communing with
[1:26:46] your own heart hallelujah David ASAP and
[1:26:54] Solomon all said this when I was
[1:26:57] communing with my brother no when I was
[1:27:01] commuting with dad no when I was
[1:27:04] commuting with my sister no when I was
[1:27:07] communing with myself
[1:27:12] no sir sometimes you need communion with
[1:27:15] yourself we so minister to other people
[1:27:19] we try to help other people we try to
[1:27:22] give it and that's what you ought to do
[1:27:23] we email this text the person back try
[1:27:25] to help everybody
[1:27:26] well there's times we got to talk to
[1:27:28] ourselves
[1:27:30] because our human spirit our
[1:27:32] consciousness sometimes need to see
[1:27:35] what's now what the souls gonna say
[1:27:37] about it the will down in the soul yeah
[1:27:42] remember Solomon my register you in
[1:27:44] Proverbs remember whatsoever a man
[1:27:46] thinketh in his heart so is he
[1:27:50] and in the context of that that's
[1:27:54] speaking of an evil man so an evil man
[1:27:59] the Bible it lets us pull it up there
[1:28:01] and go to proverbs the evil man and
[1:28:06] overs an evil person knows their evil
[1:28:08] when they're trying to deceive you they
[1:28:12] know it
[1:28:14] yeah proper 23:8 or six and seven there
[1:28:21] is going to be no soul that goes on the
[1:28:23] day of judgment says well I didn't know
[1:28:24] I was doing evil I don't know I was
[1:28:25] trying to lie I don't know I was trying
[1:28:26] to deceive God will say no you did know
[1:28:29] because here's your desire here's your
[1:28:32] soul here's your will you knew it
[1:28:35] because the Bible said as he thinketh in
[1:28:37] his heart so is he the atmosphere of his
[1:28:41] thoughts prove what's in his soul God
[1:28:43] help us to have the atmosphere of the
[1:28:45] Word of God in our thoughts we meditate
[1:28:48] on God's Word proving the word is in our
[1:28:51] soul proverbs 23:7 I'm sorry 23 6 eat
[1:28:59] thou not the bread of him that hath an
[1:29:01] evil eye Oh be careful we fellowship
[1:29:03] with neither desire thou his dainty so
[1:29:08] many times Satan will trick us through
[1:29:10] people that have more money than us and
[1:29:14] you watch these message churches that
[1:29:16] follow many of them because they got all
[1:29:19] this money and church they've learned
[1:29:22] catch this they learn to trust in their
[1:29:25] ability to make money more than they
[1:29:28] learn to trust in the word and the same
[1:29:33] things happening like the rich man with
[1:29:35] the Barnes he got so exalted off that I
[1:29:39] better build bigger barns and he
[1:29:42] said soul he commune with his own heart
[1:29:47] we'll read that next
[1:29:49] he said soul take your ease not in other
[1:29:52] words no longer desire or try to trust
[1:29:55] in God
[1:29:56] stop thirsting and hungry after God stop
[1:29:59] trying to seek after that take your ease
[1:30:01] because the Barnes is what you can trust
[1:30:03] in we're not trusting in any Barnes down
[1:30:06] here we are trusting in a snow house
[1:30:08] sister Karen but it's not an earthly
[1:30:10] snow house
[1:30:11] it's a heavenly storehouse Amen
[1:30:12] hallelujah God's temple praise God God's
[1:30:16] bank account amen
[1:30:18] that's the heavenly one the same one
[1:30:21] Malachi was talking about bring your
[1:30:23] tithes and offerings to the storehouse
[1:30:25] to God he's not necessarily talking
[1:30:26] about the natural storehouse he's
[1:30:28] talking about the heavenly storehouse
[1:30:29] the account where God keeps track of
[1:30:31] your account in heaven praise God hey
[1:30:34] man learn to trust money what is the
[1:30:39] greatest temptation what is the root of
[1:30:41] all evil the love so you watch these
[1:30:50] next few weeks and months years you
[1:30:53] watch who leaves first people to go this
[1:30:56] money I don't see anybody who's leaving
[1:30:59] that's poor and destitute it's all these
[1:31:02] rich smart intellectual people and then
[1:31:07] for example they'll make statements like
[1:31:09] this brother Branham plagiarized the
[1:31:11] seven seals and I've told you program
[1:31:13] did use some of Larkins ideas but not
[1:31:16] the revelations of how do you know cuz
[1:31:18] I've had personal emails with people
[1:31:21] that tried to tell me that and I went
[1:31:23] and studied it myself and brother Ram
[1:31:24] didn't plagiarize the revelation behind
[1:31:27] it he got that from heaven hey man let
[1:31:32] me tell you what Larkin said the fall
[1:31:34] for horse riders were all in the
[1:31:36] Tribulation Period and brother Ram
[1:31:38] teaches very differently than that hey
[1:31:40] how do they yeah totally different but
[1:31:46] yet he says the white horse rider is
[1:31:47] Satan's Superman the Antichrist but he
[1:31:49] places all of them 2,000 years before
[1:31:52] brother Branham placed him
[1:31:55] hallelujah praise God see though what is
[1:32:01] it there it is right there they're just
[1:32:01] Satan's got 99% truth but he's got 1% oh
[1:32:11] yeah we will prove all things that Bride
[1:32:14] of Christ fellowship you better believe
[1:32:15] it yes we will try every spirit that
[1:32:20] tries to come against the word cuz this
[1:32:25] another man's not here to defend himself
[1:32:26] it's easy to say but I was wrong when
[1:32:28] he's not here to stand up for himself
[1:32:30] I'll tell you this Jesus is here and
[1:32:33] he'll stand up for himself to Jesus here
[1:32:37] in you and I praise God we've got to
[1:32:41] stand with Christ amen we're taking
[1:32:44] sides with Jesus amen the word so a lot
[1:32:49] of these things believe the sign says a
[1:32:50] lot of them are true we're not all of
[1:32:52] them because they always got a lot of
[1:32:54] truth but not all the truth so who's got
[1:33:01] who's trying to trick you the one who's
[1:33:04] got dainty meats oh he'll have this nice
[1:33:06] fellowship with you and you see a lot of
[1:33:10] them want to take out for coffee now and
[1:33:11] they'll buy your coffee
[1:33:14] dainty coffee well I'll get you coffee
[1:33:18] don't ever see I'll buy your coffee
[1:33:21] don't have somebody buy your coffee if
[1:33:23] they're trying to talk you out of the
[1:33:24] word come see me I'll give you a gift
[1:33:27] card to Starbucks here whatever you want
[1:33:29] look how they do it dainty they try to
[1:33:32] impress you but he's got the evil eye
[1:33:38] look what he says for as he thinketh in
[1:33:40] his heart so is he
[1:33:43] so the whole time he's thinking if I
[1:33:45] just buy this guy out he's gonna come
[1:33:48] follow me look in the next verse I'm
[1:33:53] sorry
[1:33:53] yeah I'm sorry there it is verses eat
[1:33:55] and drink saith he T but his heart is
[1:33:59] not with thee understand
[1:34:03] if someone wants a question about the
[1:34:04] message you can do it on your own but I
[1:34:06] recommend having me there or somebody
[1:34:09] you know that loves the word you can
[1:34:12] stand dude okay bro you can say it but
[1:34:14] if you got any question whether you
[1:34:15] should do it or not
[1:34:15] wait let me be there or let somebody
[1:34:20] else be there someone that you know will
[1:34:21] stand with the word you can stand on the
[1:34:25] own don't get me wrong but if you if
[1:34:26] you're not sure we it's better that we
[1:34:29] stand together than stand alone this is
[1:34:34] what they do they wine you and dine you
[1:34:37] they'll say brother I love you sister I
[1:34:40] love you so much let's talk you better
[1:34:43] be careful who you talk to because
[1:34:48] they're trying to get you to go off into
[1:34:51] lawlessness there watch that how does
[1:35:00] that help every see that we always use
[1:35:02] that scripture for the believer but it's
[1:35:04] true it's true true whatever you think
[1:35:06] that's what you are
[1:35:06] but in reality it was used by God to
[1:35:09] validate a deceiver always knows what
[1:35:12] they're doing
[1:35:14] they know God puts a witness in their
[1:35:17] heart they know in their heart what they
[1:35:19] are and they're just denying it that's
[1:35:26] why I left
[1:35:27] message for some brother this week he
[1:35:29] was trying to talk me out of Bella
[1:35:30] Branham being a prophet and he
[1:35:32] plagiarized Larkin and I said listen sir
[1:35:36] I said the reason I know bro Ram is a
[1:35:40] prophet because of the doctrine that he
[1:35:41] preached the word yes their signs
[1:35:45] wonders miracles all those things I said
[1:35:47] the reason I know he's a prophet with
[1:35:49] biskits because he taught holiness unto
[1:35:50] God the Word of God are there questions
[1:35:54] about this of that of course we have
[1:35:56] answers for that yes of course but I had
[1:36:00] to say that I had to say the reason I'm
[1:36:04] with the message is because it's the
[1:36:06] word and before I came to this message
[1:36:11] I couldn't overcome anything I mean I
[1:36:14] guess I should say that I overcame music
[1:36:16] I throw my music away after I got saved
[1:36:18] but I couldn't overcome a lot of sexual
[1:36:21] temptation I couldn't overcome movies
[1:36:23] are gonna overcome sports or tobacco
[1:36:25] there's so many other things that can
[1:36:27] overcome but God is my witness as soon
[1:36:30] as I dedicated myself to this word and
[1:36:32] this message and receive the revelation
[1:36:34] God took all of it away because it's the
[1:36:37] word that judges it's the word that cast
[1:36:39] doubt it's a mighty weapon and I know
[1:36:42] this message is right because the waves
[1:36:44] are made alive to me just like his men
[1:36:46] made alive to you who praise God I know
[1:36:50] what it's like to sit in the church and
[1:36:52] hear people speak in tongues and
[1:36:54] prophesied and come to pass and yet
[1:36:57] later the wear short shorts or show show
[1:37:01] all their cleavage off and paint their
[1:37:02] faces I know what that's like I know
[1:37:07] it's like to sit the Church of a college
[1:37:09] service where you got women and
[1:37:11] miniskirts and you can hardly look at
[1:37:12] the screen because they're sitting over
[1:37:14] there and talking about how much they
[1:37:16] love Jesus and they play movies and they
[1:37:19] show cuss words of movies and then
[1:37:20] preach about it
[1:37:21] minutes later I know what that's like
[1:37:25] and they have healings too they have
[1:37:26] testimonies too but I know it's like
[1:37:29] when there's holiness and unholiness
[1:37:31] others we should sense we can sense the
[1:37:35] Spirit of Truth and the spirit of error
[1:37:37] because the word is a judge the word is
[1:37:41] the Sailor are the thoughts and intents
[1:37:43] of the heart
[1:37:44] praise God and that man told me I told
[1:37:48] you when I preach on the Pilgrims that
[1:37:50] man told me Jesse be come for the
[1:37:51] message he said you'll become a separate
[1:37:53] Avista he said you're getting too far
[1:37:56] away from the world so you can't relate
[1:37:59] to them anymore I'm like I'm glad I
[1:38:01] can't relate to them anymore in other
[1:38:04] words I don't want to mix with the world
[1:38:06] I would be totally separate from the
[1:38:08] world and I want to separate myself to
[1:38:10] fellowship with Christ I've seen that
[1:38:15] been around both people that have got
[1:38:17] miracles people that don't have miracles
[1:38:18] they always intermix they mixed sin and
[1:38:21] lust into the worship of God when it has
[1:38:24] no part in it he became our sin that we
[1:38:31] might become his righteousness praise
[1:38:35] God
[1:38:37] how'd I get here okay communing with
[1:38:39] your own heart your faith will your soul
[1:38:44] will go under seasons of tests Peter
[1:38:47] said there's a season where you undergo
[1:38:50] the fiery test of your faith in 1st
[1:38:52] Peter 1 6 to 8 despite unspeakable loss
[1:38:55] suffering disappointment the prophet job
[1:38:58] he eventually recognized his faith was
[1:39:01] on trial amen
[1:39:03] his flesh had sores and all these things
[1:39:07] his flesh and all of this but he
[1:39:08] eventually recognized I'm going through
[1:39:10] a trial because he said this in job
[1:39:13] 23:10 but he knoweth the way that I take
[1:39:16] God knows the way I'm going God knows my
[1:39:18] will God knows the cloth I'm choosing
[1:39:20] amen
[1:39:21] he says when he hath tried me I shall
[1:39:24] come forth as gold amen
[1:39:28] these tests are trials what really do
[1:39:32] you desire what's your real true choice
[1:39:34] what's your really your will of your
[1:39:36] free more what do you want to do what do
[1:39:39] you really want in life before you die I
[1:39:42] want to serve Jesus Christ and I want to
[1:39:46] live eternally with him praise God that
[1:39:49] is my one
[1:39:51] and anything mother vague that stops me
[1:39:55] from that I will praise God
[1:40:00] because it's not on him anymore the
[1:40:02] crucified with Amen Lord Jesus already
[1:40:05] took a crucifixion it's not him to
[1:40:08] crucify these things anymore
[1:40:09] it's a nurse we must die daily and we
[1:40:12] must crucify the lust of the flesh now
[1:40:19] it's our turn to crucify our own desires
[1:40:24] don't crucify the word that's what those
[1:40:26] sinners are doing crucify the desires I
[1:40:31] was playing the preaches of Austin came
[1:40:33] but look take your Bible here
[1:40:39] Colossians I'm sorry Romans 8:13 it's
[1:40:43] set in both Romans 8:13 literally Church
[1:40:48] we have services where I should say
[1:40:52] literally but it's like a spiritual
[1:40:54] truth you are trying to crucify the
[1:40:58] human will you are trying to crucify the
[1:41:04] sin nature that's in you why you gotta
[1:41:08] be so hard why is gonna be sir
[1:41:09] because I'm trying to get you to you and
[1:41:11] I to kill our desires because if not
[1:41:14] it's gonna kill us right Romans 8:13 for
[1:41:20] if you live after the flesh ye shall die
[1:41:24] but if you through the spirit see we
[1:41:27] need the spirit the Lord amen
[1:41:28] it's a discerner it divides asunder so
[1:41:31] instead it discerns if you through the
[1:41:34] spirit do mortify the deeds of the body
[1:41:36] you shall live jesus said you cannot be
[1:41:40] my disciple unless you take up your
[1:41:42] cross your crucifixion and die daily let
[1:41:54] me just name a name god have mercy
[1:41:57] I don't you're on
[1:41:59] Geoff Jenkins I hate to do that but I
[1:42:03] just got to he's left a message all
[1:42:06] these years no church he's remarried his
[1:42:08] daughter a second time that's adultery
[1:42:12] and when she got married he posted the
[1:42:14] pictures on Facebook she has short
[1:42:16] shorts on she's sure she has a shirt
[1:42:19] that's showing off her entire belly and
[1:42:20] showing off her entire almost their
[1:42:22] entire top and cut hair short now is
[1:42:27] that the is that okay with the word or
[1:42:30] does that go against the word you tell
[1:42:34] me what is it gonna come down to the
[1:42:38] doctrine I think that was last year and
[1:42:42] that was here I wrote that book if you
[1:42:43] just stay in the message you could have
[1:42:44] read the book not that I'm anything but
[1:42:47] just to let you know it doesn't come
[1:42:49] from a man it did not come from William
[1:42:51] Graham it didn't originate with William
[1:42:53] Graham it came from God amen okay from
[1:42:56] the Lord holding this modesty
[1:42:59] righteousness the Word of God about hey
[1:43:01] legs and all these things it comes from
[1:43:03] God's Word but if you got the Holy
[1:43:07] Spirit you'll crucify mortify the deeds
[1:43:10] and the evil sins of the flesh and then
[1:43:16] brother sister then you really live I'm
[1:43:21] really living today please God when I
[1:43:23] crucify the desires of my flesh I'm
[1:43:27] really alive you are really alive when
[1:43:34] you obey the Holy Spirit and you don't
[1:43:37] do what your flesh wants to do then you
[1:43:40] really feel live and I told you he's the

[1:45:29] this if you want to live by the Holy
[1:45:31] Spirit
[1:45:31] this has to die it's got to be mortified

[1:46:11] fellowshipping with somebody else that's
[1:46:13] a battle but communing with your own art
[1:46:19] wrestling with the will psalms 4 verse 4
[1:46:26] stand at all and sin not commune with
[1:46:29] your own heart upon your bed and be
[1:46:32] still see why your home life is so
[1:46:36] important to pursue that david is
[1:46:38] placing the most important conversations
[1:46:42] you could ever have
[1:46:43] where are they at in your home because
[1:46:46] you've got a your your your spewing
[1:46:48] spirit has to choose if you're gonna
[1:46:51] receive faith in your soul and do God's
[1:46:53] desire or reject it and do your own
[1:46:56] human desire david places it you're on
[1:47:01] your bed kind of say this you're in the
[1:47:03] prayer closet can say like this you're
[1:47:06] at your kitchen table you're on your
[1:47:08] couch you're in your lazyboy wherever
[1:47:10] you are you are in your home all by
[1:47:12] yourself it's nice nighttime it's quiet
[1:47:14] it's still it's just you community with
[1:47:16] you how did ya darling it's just you and
[1:47:23] you and the Holy Spirit has divided this
[1:47:29] oh this is a soul-searching moment right
[1:47:31] here
[1:47:33] remember I said on Wednesday at the
[1:47:35] Christmas service you and I have to make
[1:47:38] the most important decisions of our
[1:47:41] lives
[1:47:41] those are soul-searching moments and
[1:47:44] you've got to make them and make sure
[1:47:46] you're obeying the Holy Spirit in those
[1:47:50] soul-searching moments like who you
[1:47:52] marry like your relationships where you
[1:47:54] live where you go to church who's your
[1:47:56] pastor those are soul altering decisions
[1:48:01] they will either direct you because your
[1:48:03] soul direction but as the Bible says
[1:48:05] your
[1:48:06] so you convert a soul from the air of
[1:48:09] his way so the way you walk depends on
[1:48:12] the desire of your heart your desire
[1:48:14] determines the way you got to convert a
[1:48:19] sinner from the error of his way so this
[1:48:25] church if it's the right church for you
[1:48:27] it would point your way to Jesus Christ
[1:48:29] the word in a relationship you will make
[1:48:34] their decision until you believe it's
[1:48:35] God's will for you to do that if it's
[1:48:38] moving or taking a job like we've seen
[1:48:41] I've made mistakes with that telling you
[1:48:44] person to take a job and I should not
[1:48:46] have done that and I've told you that
[1:48:48] I'm sorry I got to forgive me but it's
[1:48:51] got to be based upon if they'll be fully
[1:48:53] determined upon the word of God's every
[1:48:55] other sentence your biggest decisions in
[1:48:58] life these times these soul-searching
[1:49:01] moments worth just you and you you got
[1:49:04] to make sure you're hearing the voice of
[1:49:06] God at that time how do you know it's a
[1:49:08] still small voice and it'll only be a
[1:49:10] word voice it will not be another voice
[1:49:13] mom and dad Papa they might agree with
[1:49:15] the word but it's first got to be right
[1:49:16] here in the word right here in the word
[1:49:23] soul-searching is during these
[1:49:25] distraction-free quiet times Psalm 77
[1:49:29] six I call to remembrance my song in the
[1:49:32] night times like we're just singing I
[1:49:34] love you Jesus Oh hallelujah praise be
[1:49:37] to God he said I commune with my own
[1:49:41] heart and my spirit made diligent search
[1:49:47] like my ram said every heart has got
[1:49:49] doors a door of relationships right a
[1:49:55] door of this a door of that there's all
[1:49:58] these doors and your heart has to make
[1:50:01] diligent searches at these
[1:50:03] soul-searching moments that's
[1:50:10] if you know is when you open up and this
[1:50:13] happens every person when you start
[1:50:16] doing this whole search it's the Holy
[1:50:18] Spirit guiding you to do that because
[1:50:21] the Bible says very plainly 1st
[1:50:25] chronicles 28:9 the Lord searches all
[1:50:28] hearts and understands all the
[1:50:31] imaginations of the thoughts if thou
[1:50:33] seek him he will be found of thee but if
[1:50:36] thou forsake him he will cast the off
[1:50:37] forever
[1:50:39] so when people start meditating brother
[1:50:42] amen on their souls and their desires
[1:50:43] and the will of God it's as if God comes
[1:50:46] right down next to them and they either
[1:50:48] accept God or they cast God's off God's
[1:50:52] leading off and they take their own
[1:50:54] human will and desires rather than God's
[1:50:56] desires but they can never say God
[1:50:58] wasn't with me when I made that decision
[1:51:00] because God said I am the lord who
[1:51:02] searches the rains and the depths of the
[1:51:05] heart praise God amen though never say
[1:51:09] the Holy Spirit told me it was okay
[1:51:12] they'll never say that because Jesus
[1:51:15] says it in revelation 22 verse 23 I am
[1:51:19] he who is the one who is the Lord that
[1:51:21] searches the heart Jesus who's the land
[1:51:24] that's with you as you search your heart
[1:51:26] Jesus amen
[1:51:28] Jesus I am he that searches the reigns
[1:51:32] of the heart Jeremiah
[1:51:42] 18:10 I the LORD search the heart I try
[1:51:45] the reins and give to every man
[1:51:47] according to his ways and according to
[1:51:49] the fruit of his doings once Jude once
[1:51:52] Judas made that decision I am gonna sell
[1:51:54] out the message I am gonna spell out
[1:51:56] Jesus the messenger God had to give him
[1:51:58] the fruits of it which turned out to be
[1:52:03] what humiliation he gave himself over to
[1:52:06] the devils and the devils what they do
[1:52:08] they commit suicide and the Bible said
[1:52:11] he went to his own place the Lord gave
[1:52:14] you the fruit if you want it go ahead if
[1:52:16] you want to be led by these demons go
[1:52:18] ahead but they're gonna take you places
[1:52:20] you don't want to go but they can't say
[1:52:23] well the Lord wasn't with me
[1:52:24] the Lord did the war Lord wasn't trying
[1:52:27] to talk me out yes he was because he
[1:52:29] said I searched every heart
[1:52:31] I searched the reigns and the desires of
[1:52:35] every heart but Jeremiah 29:13 promises
[1:52:43] and ye shall seek me and find me when
[1:52:45] you search for me with all your heart
[1:52:49] hey Lord take all I would I want you to
[1:52:54] have all my desire take all of my will
[1:52:58] I'm searching for your will I want
[1:53:01] everything you have for me in my soul he
[1:53:05] said you'll find me if you search for me
[1:53:08] with everything you got
[1:53:09] if you crucify every desire desire to be
[1:53:13] rich desire to have these lust desire to
[1:53:16] have that desire that popularity if you
[1:53:18] crucify all these then go searching for
[1:53:19] Christ you shall find him you'll find
[1:53:22] the word praise the Lord that man in
[1:53:30] Luke
[1:53:30] 19 said and I'll say to my soul soul
[1:53:33] that's found goods I'm sorry that was
[1:53:36] much Goods laid up for many years take
[1:53:37] that ease eat drink and be merry he
[1:53:44] decided to write their soul stop
[1:53:46] desiring the things of God now we are
[1:53:49] going to trust in our barns don't trust
[1:53:53] anymore

[1:53:57] take your East soul we're just gonna
[1:54:02] we're gonna cruise now and our spiritual
[1:54:05] walk Oh help us Jesus right that's what
[1:54:08] he's saying let's cruise I just put it
[1:54:10] on cruise control no longer trust a
[1:54:12] little like I got this all figured out
[1:54:14] and Jesus said thou fool your soul is
[1:54:19] gonna be demanded of you tonight so that
[1:54:25] means Jesus listening the whole time
[1:54:26] don't trust in your Barnes don't trust
[1:54:28] that don't but as he searched his heart
[1:54:30] he's far as I I desire to have the
[1:54:32] Barnes is my anchor I'm trusting in my
[1:54:35] money trusting in my job instead of
[1:54:40] trusting in God Almighty Jesus said
