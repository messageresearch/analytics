[34:31] [Applause]
[34:36] tonight by god's grace
[35:14] scripture uh just glued my face there
[35:18] and i think
[35:20] obviously i had time to study out
[35:23] i think i just said that you guys would
[35:25] be blessed by it once we showed this and
[35:26] the ties right in with the end it's a
[35:28] perfect go-getter but uh amen feel
[35:31] blessed and the lord showed that and you
[35:33] know what it shows me that scripture
[35:35] shows me
[35:37] the same problems we've had in this day
[35:41] they had back there that's right amen it
[35:45] really just made things clear to me
[35:48] this is exciting i'm excited amen
[35:50] because
[35:52] i know brother jason he's full-time
[35:54] as far as he preaches
[35:56] constantly continuing if you understood
[35:59] what the pastors go to
[36:01] a pastor will get up there
[36:03] and he'll preach a sunday service
[36:06] and then monday is kind of his one day
[36:07] break
[36:08] kind of because the pressure's still
[36:10] there it's just like a housewife or
[36:12] uh
[36:13] you know you go to work but you know you
[36:15] have to do something you have to get
[36:17] something prepared to serve tomorrow you
[36:18] have to get something prepared the next
[36:20] day after that you always have there's
[36:22] always that thing on the back burner you
[36:23] have to have something ready for someone
[36:26] to eat
[36:27] and that's exactly what pastor does they
[36:29] get i guess probably thursday is their
[36:31] best day because friday saturday
[36:34] service is coming lord what are you
[36:35] going to give me uh
[36:37] mondays a little break the tuesday lord
[36:39] what do you got this wednesday's coming
[36:41] but jesse has three services a week
[36:42] that's called
[36:46] a lot of pressure a lot of stress on the
[36:48] mind
[36:49] uh
[36:51] i don't wanna keep you standing by god's
[36:52] grace let's turn to two sets of
[36:53] scriptures
[36:55] and
[36:57] this morning i kind of thought
[36:58] inspirational even though i had stuff
[37:00] but i i didn't lean on my powerpoint i'm
[37:03] gonna do that again tonight if that's
[37:04] all right yes sir amen all points take
[37:06] so much time to
[37:09] not much time
[37:10] let's let's let's let's go to genesis 4.
[37:12] i love starting in genesis
[37:15] everything points to genesis every
[37:18] question
[37:19] every answer
[37:20] right there in genesis we could
[37:22] literally prove almost everything
[37:24] right in the first
[37:26] probably six or seven chapters of
[37:27] genesis
[37:30] in genesis 4
[37:35] we couldn't uh stand from reading the
[37:37] word
[37:38] we would approach
[37:40] and i know many of us would not approach
[37:42] joe biden our president
[37:45] various things
[37:47] but if we had to approach him
[37:49] we must be reverend
[37:52] all right much more rather approached
[37:55] donald trump
[37:58] uh jeffrey not the the clintons or the
[38:00] wishes of obama's but
[38:02] you're not saying but anyway there were
[38:04] a little reverence for the reading of
[38:04] the word of god so yes uh certainly lord
[38:07] we love the lord um amen so we'll read
[38:10] this here genesis 4 8
[38:13] we're approaching the king here
[38:16] lord jesus christ and cain
[38:19] talked with abel his brother
[38:21] and it came to pass when they were in
[38:23] the field that cain rose up against abel
[38:25] his brother and slew him
[38:28] and the lord said unto cain where is
[38:31] abel thy brother and he said
[38:33] i know not
[38:35] am i my brother's keeper
[38:38] verse 10
[38:39] and he said what hast thou done
[38:41] the voice of my brother of thy brother's
[38:44] blood crieth unto me from
[38:47] the ground
[38:48] amen
[38:49] let's jump to john 11.
[39:09] john 11
[39:10] 17.
[39:21] then jesus came
[39:23] and he found that he had
[39:25] laying in the grave four days already
[39:27] now bethany was dying to jerusalem about
[39:29] 15 four longs off and many of the jews
[39:32] came to martha and mary to comfort them
[39:35] concerning their brother
[39:37] now that's two brothers
[39:41] then martha as soon as she heard that
[39:43] jesus was coming
[39:45] went and met him
[39:47] but mary stan sat still in the house
[39:50] then said martha unto jesus lord if thou
[39:53] had been here my brother would not have
[39:55] died
[39:57] but i know that even now whatsoever thou
[39:59] ask
[40:00] will ask of god god will give it thee
[40:03] jesus said unto her
[40:06] thy brother shall rise again
[40:08] and martha said unto him i know that he
[40:10] shall rise again in the resurrection
[40:13] at the last day
[40:15] so let's say
[40:16] a word of prayer
[40:20] hear the father lord jesus so he
[40:21] certainly love you lord god we come
[40:24] humble wherever
[40:26] lord loving you know god i know you're
[40:28] so good don't believe it a little nobody
[40:30] like me in the world
[40:32] i know we pray lord knowing i'm
[40:34] approaching
[40:35] you lord god and
[40:50] bless the minds of people god hear all
[40:53] things out lord in that spirit realm
[40:55] clogs here and there in the little
[40:58] inlets and outlets that we're going to
[40:59] just ask on you and reveal yourself once
[41:02] again today or we love you
[41:04] bless the service god bless the heroes
[41:06] of the
[41:18] world um
[41:21] as uh
[41:22] we'll be having a second service here
[41:26] um
[41:27] for the first time i think since i've
[41:29] been
[41:31] ministering for brother jesse
[41:33] this service here this back in the study
[41:35] i had absolutely nothing and um
[41:39] usually i have something
[41:40] waiting somebody taught at home or a
[41:42] font or this and this but second service
[41:45] i had absolutely
[41:46] just got back there and prayed and said
[41:47] lord what would you have me to teach on
[41:49] the day
[41:50] but jesse had to
[41:52] minister along and spoke here at the end
[41:54] their first service about the
[41:56] resurrection
[41:57] of jesus christ and this is the time
[41:59] when christians
[42:08] churches of god
[42:10] are filled and there's christmas and
[42:12] they're going easter most of the time
[42:14] maybe mother's day pretty kind of pack
[42:16] maybe father's day
[42:19] more mother's day than father's day
[42:21] more uh sons and daughters respect their
[42:24] mom a lot time for their dad
[42:27] maybe that's just the way things
[42:30] anyhow
[42:31] i'd like to teach on by the grace of god
[42:34] uh on the topic of
[42:37] a god of demonstration amen
[42:41] so in my thought today my thought
[42:43] process because uh i'm just asking lord
[42:46] i had increased my thoughts here and
[42:48] just give me words and scriptures
[42:50] running and just kind of fill my my
[42:53] heart and my mouth with these thoughts
[42:55] here
[42:57] i read these first two scriptures and uh
[43:02] if you look at genesis four and eight
[43:04] you know we know the two seeds that came
[43:06] forth they're cain and abel and
[43:09] uh if you could imagine if we could like
[43:11] hover above that scene right there uh
[43:14] cain uh and abel meeting in the field
[43:18] and notice the worship the church
[43:20] service was over the vindication of god
[43:23] coming down was over and here now
[43:25] they're coming and meeting in the field
[43:27] i don't know who called the meeting did
[43:29] cain call the meeting said kane abel i
[43:31] want to talk to you here in the field or
[43:33] did abel feel led of the holy ghost to
[43:35] come and say cain uh uh maybe if you
[43:38] would just do it this way after god had
[43:40] already told him i don't know we don't
[43:42] know how or what kind of circumstances
[43:44] who got an invitation and who didn't
[43:46] enter however but one thing for certain
[43:48] we know the bible says that the
[43:50] scripture declares that there is a
[43:52] meeting in the field there was a council
[43:55] held and something in that council those
[43:58] two were conversing nonetheless uh
[44:01] obviously and and one said something and
[44:04] obviously it must have pierced cain's
[44:06] heart and king got all riled up and and
[44:09] and we see that the kingdom lashed out
[44:12] with anger lashed out with violence
[44:14] which is according to that seed line
[44:16] that is that saints of god is animal
[44:19] nature yes the nature of a son or
[44:22] daughter of god is not violence that's
[44:25] right the nature of a true son of god
[44:27] before the fall cain and abel had no
[44:29] there was nothing no violence whatsoever
[44:32] in their nature
[44:34] but we know in the animal kingdom that
[44:36] kind of violence was always there that
[44:38] is the oh that is the sign of the fall
[44:41] and now um
[44:43] because remember canaan were direct from
[44:45] god and there is no violence in god as
[44:48] far as matters as far as hatred or those
[44:50] sort of things that uh the the the world
[44:53] displays but here we see that what kanan
[44:56] takes on and bashes probably here's his
[44:59] brother's head against the rock or
[45:00] however and and sloom in that fashion
[45:03] yes
[45:04] and god comes down and sees this and
[45:07] uh speaks in with cain and all things
[45:09] but we have to remember
[45:11] that abel's body was laying right there
[45:14] and i don't know if cain buried him or
[45:15] not or however or whatever but i'm
[45:17] guessing probably not he was a was a
[45:19] cruel cruel man uh but let's imagine
[45:21] that's kate and
[45:23] adam and eve then come to find
[45:25] abel's body and they come and find
[45:28] abel's body because if you look in the
[45:29] scripture always the sons of god always
[45:32] place their burial to their children
[45:34] always place them back to where they're
[45:36] supposed to be married look at look at
[45:38] samson's father and his brothers went
[45:40] and got samson's body and buried it
[45:42] properly and the seed of god will always
[45:44] bury their children properly going right
[45:47] back to baptism
[45:51] so notice uh
[45:53] adam and eve and making dodging that and
[45:55] they and this is the child this is a
[45:58] child that eve had really raised up with
[46:01] kane and here he was looking at his your
[46:04] his sec her second born
[46:06] and she's looking at his body laid down
[46:10] and that body they had no idea what
[46:12] death was they had no idea what it was
[46:14] like uh even probably to even get sick
[46:16] at that time or never got a pain or an
[46:18] ailment or an infirmity or anything like
[46:20] that but now they see a something that
[46:23] was alive
[46:25] and now it is no longer alive right
[46:30] and they dig a hole in the ground
[46:33] and they place able into the ground
[46:36] and they covered it
[46:39] and now the thought is
[46:44] where's abel
[46:47] is that all there was of abel
[46:51] where is abel
[46:52] will we ever see abel again
[46:56] is this death
[46:58] you live once you're done and nothing
[47:01] after the fact
[47:04] what is the great question what is the
[47:06] meaning of life or yes is there life
[47:09] after death what what what happens after
[47:11] we die now these questions are revolving
[47:13] into the minds of cain adam and eve no
[47:16] doubt cain as well
[47:18] uh but adam and eve now questioning
[47:20] talking conversing one another at the
[47:22] night time by themselves and saying what
[47:25] would we ever see abel again he was such
[47:27] a good boy
[47:29] man look when he worshiped god that
[47:30] first time and how the spirit of god
[47:32] came down and vindicated because that's
[47:34] that's exactly what god wanted was that
[47:36] lamb's laid and that blood upon the arch
[47:40] that's exactly that's exactly what i
[47:41] thought it was as well amen amen sure
[47:45] now so and from that time
[47:48] the mystery had went full
[47:51] what takes place
[47:53] after we die
[47:55] yes it was a secret
[47:58] no one on the face of the earth had
[48:00] known
[48:01] i had recently looked at a couple of
[48:03] articles on the vikings and you read
[48:06] articles of the people of egypt
[48:09] and they we find buried treasure
[48:12] constantly in egypt
[48:14] in egypt and
[48:15] in europe and all those places and a lot
[48:17] of those hordes of treasure uh they say
[48:20] they're in egypt where because they
[48:22] believe
[48:24] in their ad as time went on and false
[48:26] went this way and true went this way and
[48:28] all kinds of things as far as religious
[48:30] at that time the false started believing
[48:33] that their natural treasures could be
[48:35] harnessed
[48:36] after they die so they would bury their
[48:38] treasure with them
[48:41] with their bodies so they want that
[48:43] after they die in their spirit then or
[48:45] whatever they were or however what was
[48:47] beyond that realm they could go back
[48:49] then and grab their treasure and use it
[48:51] on their other life
[48:53] and they say that's what the the the
[48:55] vikings believed as well they would bury
[48:57] all their treasure and that that then
[48:59] the vikings would die and they'd raise
[49:02] up and then go get unbury their treasure
[49:04] and then be able to use it in the
[49:05] afterlife
[49:08] because no one knew
[49:10] what was after the
[49:11] afterlife
[49:13] right no one had a clue what had taken
[49:15] place
[49:16] what what actually took place
[49:19] in fact you look in the scripture and
[49:21] it's not very very clear exactly what's
[49:24] going on there until it's revealed what
[49:26] in the new testament amen
[49:28] absolutely i notice
[49:30] he says but now now god actually give us
[49:32] a little clue here in genesis 4 and 10
[49:34] and he cried what has thou done god is
[49:37] speaking the king what has now done the
[49:39] voice of thy brother's blood cries from
[49:41] under the ground now paul tells us the
[49:44] blood speaks he says that's anyone that
[49:47] that knows that the blood is actually
[49:49] itself can't speak it's a chemistry it
[49:51] is that right how many knows that amen
[49:53] he says but how many knows that the
[49:55] blood speaks if you want to put that
[49:57] down in genesis 4 he says what about
[49:59] your brother his blood cries in the
[50:02] ground against cain sure what his blood
[50:06] his brother's blood now god was able to
[50:08] hear the voice of the blood that's right
[50:11] he says that's right his blood is
[50:12] speaking hallelujah
[50:14] that's what about him he said am i my
[50:16] brother's keeper he said and his blood
[50:19] is crying out his blood is crying out
[50:22] it's a token it's a token that he'd been
[50:24] killed his blood was crying out against
[50:26] him but notice
[50:28] in the hebrews 12 and verse 24 the bible
[50:31] says the blood of jesus speaketh better
[50:33] things than that of people amen
[50:36] so if god
[50:37] was able to hear the voice of abel's
[50:40] blood that shows that what that that
[50:42] blood still had to be alive somewhere
[50:45] the life that was in abel's blood still
[50:48] had to be alive because it carried a
[50:49] voice absolutely
[50:51] right all but then notice the bible says
[50:53] his paul said that watch out look at he
[50:56] says and jesus the media the new
[50:58] covenant in the blood of the springer
[51:00] that speak is better than that of abel
[51:02] but now what's better than that of abel
[51:05] abel said this man is guilty this is the
[51:08] one that killed me my blood was shed and
[51:11] this and that and i was innocent the
[51:12] bible said that what abel has a
[51:15] righteous man his righteous blood was
[51:17] held yes but notice there was nothing to
[51:20] cover cain's sin but the blood of jesus
[51:23] christ now notice this he says but he
[51:25] see abel he was a righteous man he died
[51:28] innocent because he was what in the way
[51:31] he offered the right sacrifice he was
[51:33] coming amen amen he says he was in the
[51:35] way of standing for the real revelation
[51:38] he had
[51:40] noticed what was the meeting about abel
[51:42] was standing for the true revelation of
[51:46] the world
[51:49] [Applause]
[51:52] from genesis to revelations absolutely
[51:55] so he was actually standing for the true
[51:58] understanding that god had given him and
[52:00] was vindicated by god himself yes
[52:04] hallelujah he was in the way of standing
[52:06] for the real revelation he spoke it
[52:09] cried out he says the justice blood of
[52:11] abel cried out against cain
[52:14] but now to notice the blood of jesus
[52:16] christ not only cried out it redeemed he
[52:18] says it spoke better things it makes you
[52:21] sons and daughters it hides you from the
[52:24] wrath of god the blood of abel could not
[52:27] hide
[52:31] guilty cake what uh
[52:34] abel was born into sin he says but the
[52:37] blood of jesus can cover him amen amen
[52:41] let me try to but what he left the
[52:43] presence of god amen
[52:46] sure
[52:47] so so old cane come out today if you'd
[52:49] be a prosecutor against the word he said
[52:51] days of miracles pass he says that's all
[52:53] nonsense jesus is crying out against you
[52:56] that blood of jesus christ cries out
[52:58] cries out but there is forgiveness if
[53:01] you'll just accept it amen
[53:04] amen yes we could say the longer he says
[53:07] blood speaketh a better thing
[53:09] but now notice what the beautiful thing
[53:11] now can't now abel's blood could bring
[53:13] nothing but judgment couldn't do
[53:15] anything else but notice what the blood
[53:16] of jesus christ he says he says believe
[53:19] for safety
[53:21] he says believe he says what you want to
[53:23] believe for he says he says if you want
[53:26] safety believe for it he says you
[53:28] believe for your safety then apply the
[53:30] token to your whole family
[53:32] he says see he says how can he do it
[53:34] claim it if it worked on you he says and
[53:37] you and the word become one he says
[53:39] it'll work for both of them
[53:45] he says you and the word of one he's
[53:46] then apply it to your children apply it
[53:48] to your loved ones he says just like
[53:50] rahab absolutely
[53:52] because the blood of jesus christ is
[53:54] what he says it actually speaketh better
[53:56] things it forgives all sins amen
[54:00] there's nothing anyone can do they could
[54:03] uh dismert what the blood of jesus
[54:04] christ accept the unforgivable sin
[54:07] that's right
[54:08] absolutely now and dealing with this
[54:11] what was going what was beyond a plague
[54:13] if you you look at the scripture now um
[54:16] and god you know uh one thing about the
[54:19] lord jesus christ is he always leaves
[54:21] little hints in the scriptures little
[54:22] little nuggets no tokens there just for
[54:24] the bride something we can dig out of
[54:26] those sort of things and you know one
[54:28] thing about i love the the blood of
[54:30] christ speaking better things he
[54:32] reflected this if you and i spoke about
[54:34] this a little bit this morning if you
[54:36] look at ezekiel 8
[54:39] and god picks ezekiel 8 this just
[54:42] keeps he picks him up by his aqua's here
[54:44] and he brings him to the house of god to
[54:46] try them
[54:47] and notice from the first thing he if
[54:50] you remember the opening of the fourth
[54:52] the seven seals the first four the beast
[54:54] say come and see right and if you look
[54:57] at ezekiel 8 the first thing god says go
[55:00] and see
[55:01] and he saw what an image of jealousy
[55:04] that's right he says you want to see
[55:06] greater abominations than this yes
[55:08] there's another come to see go in there
[55:09] and then he looks at that one he says
[55:11] come and seize and look at and see
[55:13] another abomination
[55:14] there's four abominations there
[55:16] good first four horse riders exactly
[55:19] what we thought amen exactly just look
[55:21] at that again but notice the beautiful
[55:23] thing what does that have to do with the
[55:24] blood of jesus christ saints of god if
[55:26] we look here then he's in
[55:28] in ezekiel 9
[55:31] and the lord started to go
[55:33] through the midst of the city through
[55:34] the midst of jerusalem and mark on the
[55:36] foreheads of the men that sigh and cry
[55:39] for the abomination is done in the midst
[55:41] thereof yes
[55:43] not only we to call these things out but
[55:45] we're to pray for these uh it's like
[55:47] this clergy caught up into all these
[55:50] things
[55:51] for all the people causing these
[55:52] abominations we're praying for them
[55:54] hallelujah ray what you while applying
[55:57] the token upon the blood of jesus christ
[55:59] to those abominations things god said he
[56:02] would mark you he would see him
[56:03] [Music]
[56:06] because what the blood of christ
[56:08] not only now god had to expose it but
[56:11] now that he's been able to see it and
[56:13] it's revealed to him now he knows what
[56:15] to pray for amen
[56:17] glory made plain sure
[56:20] now notice
[56:21] no the book of job they say is the
[56:23] oldest book in the bible
[56:25] even though his face was certain this
[56:26] and then however
[56:28] the first five books were written by
[56:29] moses we know that
[56:31] job precedes or post dates uh or or
[56:34] predates uh uh moses
[56:37] and now the beautiful thing about
[56:39] job we get a real clear on how this this
[56:42] this question
[56:43] just
[56:44] just consume the thoughts now remember
[56:47] joe was considered one of the wisest men
[56:48] in his day in fact the bible said god
[56:50] god told satan he said look he said he's
[56:52] a perfect man
[56:54] but notice when he's confronted look at
[56:55] the thoughts in job's mind in job 14
[56:58] verse 1
[57:01] he says man that is born of woman is a
[57:03] few days and full of trouble
[57:05] he cometh forth like a flower and is cut
[57:08] down
[57:09] he fleeth also as a shadow and
[57:11] continuous knot notice he's dealing with
[57:13] life and death jesus man comes up and
[57:16] he's little he grows and grows and then
[57:18] he's he stays at a certain spot and then
[57:20] he starts getting older and older
[57:22] and then he's gone
[57:25] job is examining this you know why
[57:27] because job's gonna have to meet that
[57:29] too
[57:30] that same thing
[57:32] that same thing he watched as he as job
[57:34] would bury his parents and job would
[57:35] bury this person or that person this
[57:37] great person that great sister and he's
[57:39] like what is
[57:40] he said this is
[57:42] this is coming we all must face we all
[57:44] must confront this
[57:46] he says he says who can bring a clean
[57:48] thing out of an unclean not one
[57:54] that dead rotting body
[57:56] how can anything good come out of that
[57:59] because job was an old time
[58:02] he would watch a seed he'd go to a tree
[58:04] or a fruit or whatever and out of that
[58:05] fruit or that tree he would pick a seed
[58:07] and you look at this seed this brand new
[58:09] seed wow look at the seed but if it's
[58:11] going to grow he's got to place the seed
[58:13] now job's a wise man he watches the seed
[58:16] and he takes the seed and he has to
[58:18] plant it in the ground just like burying
[58:21] their bodies
[58:23] and many times without job would look at
[58:25] a seat and he dig it back up and you
[58:26] find it rotting in the ground
[58:29] and he'd come back up and let's look and
[58:31] then boom life then would come up out of
[58:33] it and he's like
[58:37] is this
[58:39] is this how life is going is this how is
[58:41] this what happens after we die
[58:44] when we come back
[58:47] it's a great question
[58:50] seeing his days are determined and the
[58:52] number of his months are with him
[58:55] thou hast appointed his bounds and he
[58:57] cannot pass we are only allowed a
[58:59] certain amount of time
[59:01] my apprentice seven years ago march 11
[59:05] 2015 died
[59:07] and i had no idea the day before he was
[59:09] his day
[59:11] he himself had no idea the day before it
[59:14] was his day
[59:15] march 10th
[59:17] but come around march 11 2015
[59:21] he expired and went on
[59:23] where did he go i don't i'm not sure i
[59:25] hope
[59:26] doesn't look good but we're not i can't
[59:27] judge
[59:30] he says turn from him that he may rest
[59:31] until he shall accomplish all the hiring
[59:34] for his day he says now look at verse 7.
[59:36] jump to verse 7 thank you he says for
[59:39] there is a hope of a tree
[59:42] he says if it be cut down then it will
[59:44] sprout again and then the tender
[59:46] breaststroke will not cease
[59:48] though the root thereof old wax old in
[59:51] the earth and the stock thereof died in
[59:53] the ground he says look trees die but
[59:55] there is a hope that something maybe a
[59:58] tree will come up out of that
[1:00:00] he says as the waters fail from the sea
[1:00:02] and the flood declines rise up so man
[1:00:04] lieth down
[1:00:06] and rises not till the heavens be no
[1:00:09] more shall they not awake nor be raised
[1:00:12] out of their sleep he says now notice
[1:00:15] he's caught the revelation
[1:00:17] but he's kind of still questioning it
[1:00:18] but he caught something he washed this
[1:00:21] tree and it lived it came up and then it
[1:00:24] died and made me cut off here and a
[1:00:26] little bit sprung up again he said look
[1:00:28] there's a chance that tree can live
[1:00:29] again i've seen it happen this tree may
[1:00:31] not have but this one did
[1:00:34] what's the difference between that when
[1:00:35] i won the grace of god amen
[1:00:40] but he caught the revelation you know
[1:00:42] the bible says uh to uh
[1:00:45] he says learn all you saints i'm just
[1:00:47] praying phrasing he says look at nature
[1:00:50] doth not nature teach you he says look
[1:00:53] at the earth it'll teach you about the
[1:00:54] gospel look at
[1:00:55] the birds
[1:00:57] the whales the fish all the things they
[1:00:59] will teach you about the nature of god
[1:01:02] and a little bit about yourself
[1:01:04] now but notice here in verse 13 oh that
[1:01:07] thou would just hide me in the grave
[1:01:08] that thou would just keep me secret
[1:01:10] until thy wrath be past that thou would
[1:01:12] have to point me a set time and remember
[1:01:15] me
[1:01:16] i don't know where i'm going he says he
[1:01:19] says but when it's time to rise he says
[1:01:20] i want god to remember my name amen
[1:01:23] absolutely he says now look at verse
[1:01:25] 14 if a man dies shall he live again he
[1:01:30] goes with the question shall he live
[1:01:32] again he says he says all the days of my
[1:01:34] appointed time will i wait till my
[1:01:36] change comes
[1:01:38] he says will they live again he says
[1:01:39] what he says he says i believe i'm going
[1:01:42] to but i don't know how many days it's
[1:01:43] going to take but i'm going to wait
[1:01:45] until then amen
[1:01:46] he had the revelation that he was going
[1:01:49] to catch it sure
[1:01:52] uh another beautiful thing there uh
[1:01:55] if you look here
[1:01:58] in
[1:02:02] in john
[1:02:04] 11 24.
[1:02:08] when her brother lazarus had died
[1:02:11] martha said
[1:02:12] i know that she that he shall rise again
[1:02:14] in the resurrection
[1:02:16] at the last day saints of god how did
[1:02:19] she know that
[1:02:21] you know how she knew that how did this
[1:02:23] woman who hadn't even conversed with
[1:02:25] christ that much or been around how did
[1:02:26] she know that he was that lazarus was
[1:02:29] going to rise against last day
[1:02:31] because it's taught in the scripture
[1:02:36] it's revealed in the word of god amen
[1:02:39] now notice she also heard this this
[1:02:42] chapter in job also in psalm 17 verse 13
[1:02:46] read that arise o lord disappoint him
[1:02:49] cast him down deliver my soul from the
[1:02:51] wicked which is thy sword now notice
[1:02:53] verse 15
[1:02:56] as for me david says i will behold thy
[1:02:59] face in righteousness i shall be
[1:03:01] satisfied when i awake with thy
[1:03:03] lightness
[1:03:05] so here uh
[1:03:06] martha would sometimes be in the
[1:03:08] synagogue listening to the torah being
[1:03:09] read and those sort of things and they
[1:03:12] would start preaching on the songs and
[1:03:14] she would say man there is a
[1:03:17] resurrection coming job said there's
[1:03:19] something coming david said there's
[1:03:21] something coming he's what they're
[1:03:22] looking for their change to be what in
[1:03:24] the image of god
[1:03:25] amen that's exactly right
[1:03:28] notice in psalms 49 verse
[1:03:32] 14
[1:03:33] he says like sheep they are laid in the
[1:03:36] grave
[1:03:37] death shall feed on them
[1:03:40] you know when the son of the daughter
[1:03:41] god dies
[1:03:42] the same worms that eat up the sinner's
[1:03:44] body eats up theirs
[1:03:47] absolutely
[1:03:48] he said that shall feed on them and the
[1:03:51] upright shall have dominion over them in
[1:03:54] the morning and their beauty shall
[1:03:56] consume in the grave with their dwelling
[1:03:58] he says but god will redeem my soul from
[1:04:01] the power of the grave
[1:04:03] amen
[1:04:06] how did martha know
[1:04:07] she heard it in the word of god through
[1:04:10] what little little sentences like this
[1:04:12] isolated here one here one there one
[1:04:14] there one presents here one thought here
[1:04:16] one line upon line uh here a little
[1:04:18] there a little but what that was a
[1:04:20] revelation that came to her
[1:04:22] absolutely now
[1:04:25] he says but god will redeem my soul from
[1:04:27] the power of the grave for he shall
[1:04:28] receive me say laugh now notice he says
[1:04:32] be not afraid when one is made rich when
[1:04:34] the glory of his house is increased
[1:04:38] david's david's seeing all these kings
[1:04:40] around him probably when he's on the run
[1:04:42] this philistine king get rich and this
[1:04:44] ammonite king this amari king and all
[1:04:46] these everybody's prospering and here's
[1:04:48] david out in the wilderness
[1:04:51] rejected
[1:04:52] anointed yet rejected
[1:04:55] he says he says when the glory of his
[1:04:57] house is increased for when he dieth he
[1:05:00] shall carry nothing away
[1:05:05] you know when david fought goliath
[1:05:06] goliath walked out there and we just saw
[1:05:08] this song sights and sounds
[1:05:11] goliath had a big old shield and a big
[1:05:13] old sword
[1:05:15] you think anyone in the camp tried to
[1:05:17] take goliath sword from them
[1:05:19] absolutely not that was goliath sword
[1:05:20] you don't touch the champ sword he's a
[1:05:22] champ he's got the belt
[1:05:25] but when david
[1:05:26] slew
[1:05:28] goliath
[1:05:29] the bible said the ministry or the house
[1:05:32] the priest of god actually then they got
[1:05:34] the sword of goliath because we see
[1:05:36] later the sword of goliath was given to
[1:05:38] david
[1:05:41] goliath didn't take that sword to fight
[1:05:43] the afterlife
[1:05:44] he was done
[1:05:46] it was over
[1:05:47] he's got enough problems where he's at
[1:05:50] now
[1:05:52] he says uh for when he dies he shall
[1:05:54] carry nothing away his glory shall not
[1:05:56] descend after him though while he lived
[1:05:58] he blessed his soul and men will praise
[1:06:01] thee when thou uh when thou do as well
[1:06:03] to thyself he shall go to the generation
[1:06:06] of his fathers and they shall never see
[1:06:09] light
[1:06:11] you mean like daylight
[1:06:13] no they'll never see it
[1:06:16] anybody ever listen watch those videos
[1:06:18] of people who god has taken to hell and
[1:06:20] take it back
[1:06:22] every
[1:06:23] simple blessing we have on earth
[1:06:27] light
[1:06:29] water
[1:06:30] comfort rest
[1:06:33] the ability to breathe strength many of
[1:06:36] them said that when they get to heaven
[1:06:37] or so when they were taken down to hell
[1:06:39] and they they were trying to fight the
[1:06:40] demons all their strength was gone
[1:06:43] strong men they couldn't fight him so
[1:06:46] everything good that we have on this
[1:06:47] side is not down there
[1:06:51] so count it a blessing but we can do
[1:06:53] anything
[1:06:55] amen yes
[1:06:56] he says well though
[1:06:58] he lit well he blessed his own soul and
[1:07:00] the men and men will praise thee when
[1:07:02] thou doest well to thyself he shall go
[1:07:05] to the generation of his father they
[1:07:06] shall never see light
[1:07:07] man that is in honor and understand not
[1:07:10] is like the beast that perished right
[1:07:12] there it is absolutely though they might
[1:07:15] be highly esteemed but not have a clue
[1:07:17] about the lord jesus christ not have a
[1:07:19] clue about what takes place in time
[1:07:21] today as far as the resurrection of
[1:07:23] jesus christ have no idea what that was
[1:07:25] all about and yet men are the hell of
[1:07:27] high this davis don't worry about it
[1:07:30] it's going to be all right
[1:07:32] now notice here
[1:07:33] uh where is she getting all these
[1:07:34] revelations i know that he shall rise in
[1:07:37] isaiah 25 or 7 and he will destroy in
[1:07:40] this mountain the face and the covering
[1:07:42] cast of all the people and the veil that
[1:07:44] has spread over nations now notice when
[1:07:45] he says in verse 8 and he will swallow
[1:07:48] up death in victory
[1:07:50] martha caught all this
[1:07:52] every he went to church her whole life
[1:07:55] he says and he's and he shall swallow up
[1:07:57] death and victory and the lord god will
[1:07:59] wipe away tears from all faces and the
[1:08:02] rebuke of his people shall he take away
[1:08:04] from all the earth for the lord hath
[1:08:06] spoken
[1:08:09] you know what i like
[1:08:11] i like someone that says something
[1:08:14] and then goes and does it makes it
[1:08:17] happen
[1:08:18] yes i think i've taught this before
[1:08:20] if you study larry bird
[1:08:22] if you know who larry legend is
[1:08:26] you know one day at the all-star game
[1:08:28] three-point contest he walked in that
[1:08:30] locker room you know what lady burns
[1:08:31] said okay who's getting second place
[1:08:35] okay and he goes out there with his
[1:08:37] warm-up jared jacket
[1:08:39] and winslet wins it
[1:08:41] he told it he spoke it and then he went
[1:08:43] and did it
[1:08:44] there was a time in one of the games he
[1:08:46] posted up against xavier mcdaniel
[1:08:51] and before that that play
[1:08:52] it was a game it had to be a
[1:08:54] game-winning shot
[1:08:55] i told you hey
[1:08:57] i'm going to shoot the ball right here
[1:08:59] and
[1:08:59] i'm going to win this game right here in
[1:09:01] front of you you can guard me it's going
[1:09:02] to be right here just be right here
[1:09:04] guy at the
[1:09:07] passing bird goes right to that spot
[1:09:09] backs him up turns around shoots it
[1:09:11] right in his face
[1:09:14] xavier mcdaniel was pretty upset about
[1:09:15] that
[1:09:18] but i like about when someone can speak
[1:09:20] something and then go back it up amen
[1:09:22] right
[1:09:23] it's what it's almost like a power
[1:09:25] behind it like almost like a faith he
[1:09:26] just knew he was labored knew he was
[1:09:28] going to do it and when you lift you you
[1:09:31] i said this if you access or even power
[1:09:34] now every man is given a message of
[1:09:35] faith yes
[1:09:37] some men who are heathens have so much
[1:09:39] faith they can make things happen
[1:09:42] because they believe right hand
[1:09:46] and when christ is revealing in his word
[1:09:49] that he's going to do this and he's
[1:09:51] going to do that he's said and he said
[1:09:53] he's going to do it then he's going to
[1:09:55] do that amen
[1:09:58] [Applause]
[1:10:02] i am not only your god he says i am your
[1:10:04] redeemer yeah oh my
[1:10:07] redeemer they weren't even redeemed for
[1:10:08] 2000 years after he spoke this well
[1:10:10] guess what he went and did it anyhow
[1:10:12] amen amen i noticed praise god if you
[1:10:16] look at this here in isaiah 26 19
[1:10:19] he says thy dead men shall live
[1:10:23] together with my dead body shall they
[1:10:25] arise
[1:10:26] awake and sing ye that dwell in dust he
[1:10:29] says for for the dew as the dew of the
[1:10:31] earth the earth shall cast out the dead
[1:10:34] and the earth shall cast out the dead
[1:10:35] absolutely what is the speaking of this
[1:10:37] is speaking of a resurrection
[1:10:39] yes absolutely
[1:10:40] in daniel 12 and verse 2 he says that
[1:10:43] many of them that sleep in the dust of
[1:10:45] the earth shall awake some to
[1:10:46] everlasting life he says and some to
[1:10:49] everlasting uh
[1:10:51] to sun to shame and everlasting contempt
[1:10:54] time and time again the scripture is
[1:10:56] prophesying that there is a resurrection
[1:11:00] coming now if you think about this
[1:11:03] when job said
[1:11:05] a tree
[1:11:07] there is a hope that a tree lives and
[1:11:09] what did job concentrate on job was
[1:11:12] concentrated on death
[1:11:13] he was looking at people who died did
[1:11:15] you know job knew about enoch but in the
[1:11:18] whole book of job job never brought up
[1:11:20] enoch because he wasn't worried about
[1:11:22] enoch because enoch was there
[1:11:25] right joe said you know i've seen these
[1:11:27] trees but you know some trees are taken
[1:11:28] to heaven doesn't say that
[1:11:30] he knew enoch was in heaven because the
[1:11:32] bible declared uh that that it was there
[1:11:35] he just knew it because it was past if
[1:11:37] you look at their timelines
[1:11:39] no i uh noah i think was even alive
[1:11:42] right around that time he may have been
[1:11:44] second hand third hand uh knowledge
[1:11:46] about all this stuff
[1:11:48] direct from the descendants of adam
[1:11:49] absolutely
[1:11:50] himself
[1:11:51] uh so here we see what he was not
[1:11:54] concerned about those that are already
[1:11:55] there there's only one man there that he
[1:11:57] knew he knew he had not died that was
[1:11:59] enough but he was concerned about those
[1:12:00] who go into the grave absolutely yes
[1:12:04] just like the prophet from god
[1:12:06] and tried to sound
[1:12:07] insurance he tried to do the old weird
[1:12:09] game with them
[1:12:11] said hey hey brother you got you got
[1:12:13] insurance he's like yeah i got insurance
[1:12:16] i was like oh that's good i was going to
[1:12:17] try and tell you something this net and
[1:12:18] the guy's like what'd you say
[1:12:20] the game
[1:12:21] assurance no no we're talking about
[1:12:23] insurance he says no i i gotta i have
[1:12:25] assurance
[1:12:26] and the brother's like well yeah but you
[1:12:28] need insurance to go into the grave and
[1:12:29] what the guy said he says i'm not
[1:12:31] worried about going in he's not worried
[1:12:32] about going up
[1:12:46] in acts 23
[1:12:50] you know
[1:12:51] you say i just read all those scriptures
[1:12:53] in the old testament and if you look at
[1:12:55] these scriptures
[1:12:56] brother it's pretty obvious
[1:12:59] that there's a resurrection that there
[1:13:01] is coming people who are going to raise
[1:13:04] from the dead now remember this is 2 000
[1:13:07] years ago there's people going to raise
[1:13:09] from the dead
[1:13:11] but if you look at the time of christ
[1:13:15] in acts 23 verse 6 in this council here
[1:13:19] in this argument with paul and all those
[1:13:20] things
[1:13:21] paul
[1:13:22] was a pharisee by by lifestyle
[1:13:26] before there
[1:13:27] by religion
[1:13:29] but when paul perceived that one part
[1:13:31] for sadducees and another part pharisees
[1:13:34] he cried out in the counsel he said men
[1:13:37] and brother i am a pharisee a son of the
[1:13:41] son of a pharisee of the hope of the
[1:13:43] resurrection of the dead am i of the
[1:13:45] hope of the resurrection that i am
[1:13:47] called in question he knew what he was
[1:13:49] doing by the spirit of god he was saying
[1:13:50] now notice this pharisees here says
[1:13:52] here's the sadducees do not believe in
[1:13:53] the resurrection i'm going to start just
[1:13:55] an upward i'm going to get them fighting
[1:13:56] each other and i'm just going to go out
[1:13:58] i'm just going to walk out
[1:13:59] and he called out and what now but the
[1:14:01] pharisees were like there is no
[1:14:03] resurrection
[1:14:05] and essentially there is no resurrection
[1:14:06] of the pharisees yes there is a
[1:14:07] resurrection absolutely
[1:14:09] and now they're getting in they're
[1:14:10] fighting each other like this and paul's
[1:14:11] just like i'm good to go
[1:14:14] all their focus is off of me now on each
[1:14:16] other in this doctrine absolutely so
[1:14:18] notice even at this time in paul's day
[1:14:20] the resurrection issue was not settled
[1:14:23] even after it was settled that's right
[1:14:29] amen
[1:14:30] but everything is a revelation
[1:14:32] everything but there's nothing can be
[1:14:34] revealed to you unless the father
[1:14:35] reveals it to you
[1:14:37] sure
[1:14:38] now notice here
[1:14:41] one day in matthew 22 verse 23
[1:14:45] he says that the same day he came
[1:14:47] he
[1:14:48] the same day came to him the sadducees
[1:14:50] which saying there is no resurrection
[1:14:53] and asked him
[1:14:55] saying master
[1:14:56] moses said if a man die having no
[1:14:58] children his brother shall marry his
[1:15:00] wife and raise up seed unto his brother
[1:15:02] and now there was there were seven
[1:15:04] brother
[1:15:05] and the first and he had married a wife
[1:15:07] to see
[1:15:08] deceased and leaving no issue left his
[1:15:10] uh wife unto another brother unto his
[1:15:12] brother likewise the second third
[1:15:14] seventh all alone
[1:15:16] and last of all the woman died
[1:15:18] therefore the resurrection therefore in
[1:15:21] the resurrection of trying to figure
[1:15:22] this out therefore another thing they
[1:15:24] don't believe in the resurrection but
[1:15:25] it's just the trying to test him
[1:15:28] therefore the resurrection whose wife
[1:15:29] shall she be of the seven before they
[1:15:31] all had her and jesus answered said to
[1:15:34] him ye do air not knowing the scriptures
[1:15:38] the very scripture we just read they
[1:15:39] didn't understand that that's right
[1:15:42] he said nor the power of god they didn't
[1:15:45] understand how powerful god was
[1:15:47] well sure god gave us life but could god
[1:15:49] give us life again
[1:15:51] absolutely
[1:15:52] yes sure
[1:15:54] this is for in the resurrection no
[1:15:56] notice jesus said there is a restaurant
[1:15:57] resurrection he said they shall they
[1:15:59] neither marry nor the given in marriage
[1:16:01] but are the angels of god in heaven but
[1:16:04] is touching the resurrection of then
[1:16:06] have he not read that that which was
[1:16:07] spoken unto you by god saying
[1:16:10] he points him to the old testament
[1:16:12] scripture going to moses
[1:16:14] he says i am the god of abraham and of i
[1:16:17] the god of eight isaac and the god of
[1:16:19] jacob
[1:16:20] god is not the god of the dead but of
[1:16:23] the living amen
[1:16:25] to the point of god
[1:16:28] if someone is not even alive anymore
[1:16:30] there would be no there'd be nothing to
[1:16:32] reign over nothing to rule over nothing
[1:16:33] to love exactly but what god has said
[1:16:36] god had a plan what that these the
[1:16:38] children of god would come down here and
[1:16:40] be tested for character god that they
[1:16:43] would be sent here to see if they could
[1:16:45] handle the challenges and we see for the
[1:16:47] first two thousand four thousand years
[1:16:49] they could not
[1:16:50] pass the test amen that's right but god
[1:16:53] had to bring something down he had to
[1:16:55] bring he had to bring a new way he had
[1:16:56] to bring a new way of salvation or
[1:16:58] something like that something that could
[1:17:01] stand the time that's food stand the
[1:17:02] test sure he says now he says now god is
[1:17:05] not the god of the dead he's but of the
[1:17:07] living
[1:17:08] absolutely
[1:17:12] and when the maltese heard this they
[1:17:14] were astonished at his doctrine amen yes
[1:17:18] now
[1:17:21] don't have much more here we'll just go
[1:17:23] continue on here by god's grace
[1:17:26] now
[1:17:26] notice he says i am the god of thy
[1:17:29] he says i am the god
[1:17:31] he says
[1:17:32] of abraham
[1:17:34] the god of isaac and the god of jacob
[1:17:38] when jesus said that those men obviously
[1:17:39] were perished
[1:17:41] over over 3 000 years already
[1:17:45] and the pharisees
[1:17:46] studied this scripture they knew the
[1:17:49] scripture
[1:17:50] this and that but they never it never
[1:17:52] occurred to them that they were still
[1:17:54] alive
[1:17:57] now here's one thing they missed
[1:17:59] specifically there's one point in the
[1:18:01] scripture where it shows a dead man is
[1:18:02] still alive and what is that
[1:18:05] elijah
[1:18:06] one of you one of the one of the
[1:18:08] beautiful things about saul's failure
[1:18:10] about saul all being fought away and the
[1:18:12] spirit of god leaving saul is that when
[1:18:14] it was revealed and all that failure it
[1:18:17] was revealed to us what that samuel was
[1:18:20] still alive but he was not up there but
[1:18:23] he was down in paradise
[1:18:27] imagine being able
[1:18:29] the first man to die
[1:18:31] and he's sinking he's not going up like
[1:18:32] he thought
[1:18:34] but i worshipped right
[1:18:36] i had the right sacrifice
[1:18:38] he's going down he did not go to hell
[1:18:41] he went to paradise
[1:18:45] the first person down there abel
[1:18:48] probably a paradise of walls going
[1:18:51] where am i at
[1:18:53] and off above beyond the golf affixed
[1:18:56] he's looking at fire
[1:18:58] he's looking at
[1:19:01] cells prison cells chains
[1:19:04] those sort of things for someone like
[1:19:05] the captain but in this area there's
[1:19:07] water there
[1:19:09] water
[1:19:10] remember the rich man said lazarus come
[1:19:13] dip your finger put your hand in some
[1:19:14] water and put it on the tip of my tongue
[1:19:17] they had water down in paradise
[1:19:20] so they could drink breathe and live
[1:19:24] nabel's like
[1:19:26] this is scary
[1:19:29] where am i but i know this i'm still
[1:19:30] alive i'm still conscious
[1:19:32] but i'm starting to have a grasp they
[1:19:34] said what when you when someone goes
[1:19:36] beyond they have a greater sense of
[1:19:38] knowledge they know so much more about
[1:19:41] what's going on
[1:19:44] so abel first off getting a little
[1:19:46] nervous maybe in paradise by himself for
[1:19:49] hundreds of years because they lived a
[1:19:50] thousand
[1:19:51] eight nine hundred he was by himself
[1:19:53] quite a bit
[1:19:54] but notice who is the next person we see
[1:19:56] dying
[1:19:57] lamech one of cain's seed killed a man
[1:20:03] able still in paradise
[1:20:06] another soul comes down
[1:20:08] first one but he's not in paradise he's
[1:20:10] down in hell right
[1:20:12] look at this
[1:20:14] yeah i'm so glad i'm right here
[1:20:16] i'm so glad to be in paradise i'm so
[1:20:18] glad when there's water and the torments
[1:20:20] they see sees this soul come down
[1:20:23] into hell and the demons jump on them
[1:20:25] latch on them chain them up throw them
[1:20:27] against the wall and start torturing and
[1:20:29] evil's going
[1:20:31] i'm so glad i offered the right side
[1:20:37] give me the revelation of the land and
[1:20:39] he gave me the revelation amen
[1:20:52] i don't know what this is but we're okay
[1:20:53] i'm gonna be okay and i was like where
[1:20:56] are we where are we at it was like we're
[1:20:58] gonna be okay there's water over here
[1:20:59] but look at this look at these guys over
[1:21:00] here because remember violence has
[1:21:02] filled the earth
[1:21:04] my souls
[1:21:07] falling into hell
[1:21:09] adam eve
[1:21:11] abel watching this thing
[1:21:13] just rejoice
[1:21:16] and they say hey go to that edge
[1:21:19] and we can't get over there and they
[1:21:21] can't get over here that's right
[1:21:26] absolutely
[1:21:28] now a beautiful thing here
[1:21:30] is she said she says look she says jesus
[1:21:33] martha says jesus i know he says when
[1:21:35] the resurrection come he shall rise
[1:21:37] again but notice in john 11 verse 25
[1:21:40] jesus said unto her he says i am the
[1:21:42] resurrection
[1:21:44] and the light yes he that believeth in
[1:21:46] me though he were dead yet shall he live
[1:21:49] now notice he they were talking about
[1:21:51] resurrection resurrection is not a thing
[1:21:53] it is a
[1:21:54] person yeah amen yeah another
[1:21:57] resurrection comes when jesus comes amen
[1:21:59] yes but the first was able to ride the
[1:22:01] dead from the grave absolutely he says
[1:22:04] now notice
[1:22:05] he says now when the true easter seal on
[1:22:08] the sunrise was broken and the secret of
[1:22:12] life after death was revealed what the
[1:22:16] what god no
[1:22:17] this is the whole he says before that
[1:22:19] time we didn't know the world growth and
[1:22:21] darkness growth around man's suspicion
[1:22:25] theories among men's hearts traditions
[1:22:27] made up about what's after length what's
[1:22:28] happening
[1:22:30] we're into death men worshiped idols
[1:22:32] they worshipped the son they worshipped
[1:22:33] all kinds of gods and all kinds of
[1:22:35] people made claims they went in the
[1:22:37] grave and stayed in the great but notice
[1:22:38] god had to prove what was going on
[1:22:41] for four thousand years he let
[1:22:43] everything continue on
[1:22:46] and it said it's time now to reveal
[1:22:48] myself
[1:22:49] and i'm gonna show the people what this
[1:22:51] was all about yes
[1:22:53] and what did god say he sent a baby down
[1:22:57] named jesus a man
[1:22:59] and he let that baby grow in favor of
[1:23:01] god in favor of man constantly for 33
[1:23:04] years and then at the end of the 30
[1:23:05] years what does he do
[1:23:07] he said because that man himself jesus
[1:23:09] himself was not ready until he was
[1:23:12] baptized
[1:23:13] and filled with the holy ghost yes now
[1:23:16] this is what the test was on
[1:23:19] did this baptism of the spirit will this
[1:23:21] get jesus out of the ground
[1:23:26] amen
[1:23:29] god said i'm going to show you something
[1:23:31] i'm going to come down there and i'm
[1:23:32] going die i'm gonna raise but i need
[1:23:34] something first i need life amen
[1:23:39] what is that it is the holy ghost it's
[1:23:41] the life of god
[1:23:43] [Music]
[1:23:44] can bring you up
[1:23:45] absolutely the devil can kill you
[1:23:48] and take this or think that'll kill he's
[1:23:50] here what to kill steal and destroy but
[1:23:52] god's the only one that can resurrect
[1:23:56] absolutely
[1:23:59] he said now but now remember he says so
[1:24:02] and then of course we know that jesus
[1:24:04] raised lazarus from the dead uh too much
[1:24:06] uh martha and mary's amazement said oh
[1:24:09] my goodness he has power over all things
[1:24:12] yes
[1:24:13] he has power over death but they did not
[1:24:16] understand that he had power i'll say
[1:24:18] like this
[1:24:19] there was healings
[1:24:21] there was even people raised from the
[1:24:23] dead in the old testament that's right
[1:24:26] paul wanted elisha's bones it was
[1:24:27] elizabeth
[1:24:29] of those two bones a man was thrown they
[1:24:30] were they were running from an army
[1:24:32] whatever the man died and they threw him
[1:24:33] on the elijah bones license and boom he
[1:24:35] came back to life
[1:24:37] so it was possible
[1:24:38] we all now when that when when jesus did
[1:24:41] this in front of
[1:24:42] martha's mine i'm sure she ran the
[1:24:45] scripture said oh
[1:24:46] he had the same cooking powers elijah
[1:24:48] did or lights right
[1:24:51] but never has a man raised up by himself
[1:24:55] by his own power yeah
[1:24:58] that's what that was
[1:25:00] he said that was the secret of life and
[1:25:03] death was revealed what the jesus christ
[1:25:05] was the one he was the light he is the
[1:25:08] one that's going to raise something by
[1:25:09] god's grace amen now
[1:25:12] the beautiful word the thing we're on
[1:25:14] easter right now
[1:25:15] this is the day they celebrate
[1:25:18] the time when christ rose from the dead
[1:25:22] and that was one of the greatest things
[1:25:24] ever take place hallelujah it literally
[1:25:26] sealed the deal that this was the
[1:25:28] correct way
[1:25:29] this was the right way that what he was
[1:25:32] the true god absolutely
[1:25:36] but did he stop there
[1:25:38] no
[1:25:39] he had to continue on his mission
[1:25:40] because now remember what did he prove
[1:25:42] he proved the power of the holy ghost on
[1:25:44] this he prophesied about uh rising up he
[1:25:48] prophesied to die and he prophesied all
[1:25:49] those things and what he went and did it
[1:25:52] so what improved what he had was good
[1:25:54] enough sure but notice he had he ended
[1:25:56] up he could not leave us gentiles he
[1:25:58] could not leave his jews that were
[1:25:59] serving by that time in their same
[1:26:01] condition he had to now change them as
[1:26:03] well and give them a spiritual dna
[1:26:06] change absolutely
[1:26:07] and then when they receive the baptism
[1:26:09] of the holy ghost you actually became a
[1:26:11] new creature in christ jesus
[1:26:14] not something old may know something
[1:26:16] absolutely completely different hey
[1:26:19] literally
[1:26:21] no
[1:26:23] if god could look at you before and
[1:26:25] after the holy ghost he would say twice
[1:26:26] you would see two different people
[1:26:28] that's right that's right
[1:26:30] not just someone with a new heart not
[1:26:32] someone with just a new spirit but now
[1:26:34] someone that has the spirit of god and
[1:26:36] themselves joined together in one amen
[1:26:40] amen
[1:26:41] absolutely
[1:26:42] he says so he did not stop there he what
[1:26:44] he had he proved that the holy ghost of
[1:26:46] this way of salvation to this religion
[1:26:49] started all the way back in genesis this
[1:26:51] true religion was the one and true
[1:26:53] religion absolutely
[1:26:55] now
[1:26:58] and i love this
[1:26:59] in matthew 3 verse
[1:27:02] 16. and jesus when he was baptized went
[1:27:06] up straight away out of the water and lo
[1:27:08] the heavens were opened unto him and he
[1:27:09] saw the spirit of god descending like a
[1:27:11] dove and light upon him
[1:27:14] see what this says here verse 17 and lo
[1:27:17] a voice from heaven saying
[1:27:19] this is my beloved son in whom i will
[1:27:22] please you
[1:27:23] all jesus had to do receive the baptism
[1:27:25] of the holy ghost and god was pleased
[1:27:27] with him
[1:27:32] [Applause]
[1:27:51] [Applause]
[1:28:09] [Applause]
[1:28:12] lori
[1:28:14] jesus prophesied also in john 14
[1:28:18] after he said i am the resurrection life
[1:28:19] he says i am the way the truth and
[1:28:23] he said father pretty much saying
[1:28:25] follow me
[1:28:27] what i do you do
[1:28:29] what i say you say what i believe you
[1:28:32] believe amen sure
[1:28:34] now
[1:28:35] in closing
[1:28:38] no it's short but
[1:28:40] it's hot up here
[1:28:42] it's like a service
[1:28:45] we're okay
[1:28:47] in closing
[1:28:49] now we
[1:28:51] have it has been revealed to us
[1:28:53] that jesus is the true god
[1:28:55] amen the lord jesus christ
[1:28:58] and
[1:29:00] not only because we see it in the
[1:29:02] scripture
[1:29:04] but we see a change in ourselves
[1:29:08] yes
[1:29:09] do we see the same battles absolutely
[1:29:11] but the desires
[1:29:13] when you take away all this flesh
[1:29:15] everything when you take all this away
[1:29:16] and all this corrupted mind the thoughts
[1:29:19] of your hearts and all those things
[1:29:21] if your one desires lord i want to
[1:29:23] please you yes no god get me there you
[1:29:27] said you would change this body you said
[1:29:29] you would allow me to make this rapture
[1:29:31] lord god i want that more than anything
[1:29:33] all right and you pray the prayer say
[1:29:35] lord god no matter what it takes feel me
[1:29:38] make sure i'm ready it's sealed
[1:29:40] [Music]
[1:29:46] our hearts desire the very bottom of
[1:29:49] heart desire should be what our main
[1:29:50] thing is to serve the lord jesus christ
[1:29:52] to be his bride to please him at all
[1:29:54] times amen amen
[1:29:56] yes now there's a scripture here
[1:29:58] in romans 6 and verse 3.
[1:30:03] if you want to die out tonight
[1:30:05] however in the morning
[1:30:06] spiritually
[1:30:07] this is what we do
[1:30:09] yes romans 3 6-3 knowing not that so
[1:30:12] many of us was baptized into jesus
[1:30:14] christ was baptized into his
[1:30:17] death so baptism represents the death
[1:30:20] and burial of christ
[1:30:22] he says therefore we are buried with him
[1:30:24] by baptism
[1:30:26] into death
[1:30:27] why
[1:30:28] that like as christ raised up from the
[1:30:31] dead notice they
[1:30:33] they were there
[1:30:34] yes paul was eyewitness to that pillar
[1:30:37] of fire and with that pillar of fire
[1:30:38] saying with that fellaini
[1:30:40] i am
[1:30:41] jesus
[1:30:47] absolutely amen
[1:30:49] lord
[1:30:51] therefore we are buried with and by
[1:30:53] baptism in the death that like as christ
[1:30:55] was raised up to the dead by the glory
[1:30:57] of the father even so we should walk in
[1:30:59] newness of life
[1:31:01] why where's the promise he says it now
[1:31:04] he's going to say right here and we're
[1:31:05] going to bank on it
[1:31:06] because he's already showed he can do it
[1:31:08] on himself and if we receive the exact
[1:31:11] same stuff that he had if we're saying
[1:31:13] the same spirit
[1:31:15] notice in verse 5 for if we have been
[1:31:17] planted together in the likeness of his
[1:31:20] death we shall also in the likeness of
[1:31:22] his resurrection amen we get baptized
[1:31:30] rise
[1:31:32] what when jesus comes in the
[1:31:33] resurrection or the first resurrection
[1:31:35] or the rapture
[1:31:38] sure now
[1:31:41] i want to show you this i'm going to
[1:31:42] show you this little nugget the lord
[1:31:44] just
[1:31:45] throws yes bigger just free studying
[1:31:48] you don't want to test from just 12.
[1:31:51] he studies
[1:31:53] and he's got memory helps a lot too
[1:31:57] now
[1:31:58] i want to show you this
[1:32:01] to me this was how
[1:32:03] are you bad
[1:32:07] uh to me
[1:32:09] but
[1:32:09] i like the nuggets i like the goal
[1:32:12] i like i like to see
[1:32:14] things just pop out there there it is
[1:32:16] more proof amen another thing to put in
[1:32:19] the stockpile of scripture ammo
[1:32:21] because scripture war is coming that's
[1:32:23] right amen
[1:32:25] and if everyone the king indicators
[1:32:28] one of the key indicators of someone is
[1:32:30] a scene of god or even has the holy
[1:32:32] ghost they'll believe the word of god
[1:32:35] above everything amen
[1:32:37] amen
[1:32:39] and the holy ghost will give them the
[1:32:40] true interpretation of the word amen yes
[1:32:43] absolutely
[1:32:45] now let's continue on here
[1:32:47] and look at this
[1:32:48] as as christ had res up raised up from
[1:32:51] the dead
[1:32:52] we know he went down to the bible said
[1:32:54] that he what he was crucified he went
[1:32:55] down to hell and he preached to those
[1:32:58] lost ones at the time of noah for three
[1:33:00] days
[1:33:01] he went to satan he took the keys of
[1:33:03] death held a grave and then he ascended
[1:33:05] right
[1:33:11] now notice here in revelations one and
[1:33:13] seven
[1:33:16] now the book of revelations
[1:33:18] is a special prophetic
[1:33:20] book
[1:33:23] and you study the message of the hour
[1:33:25] the prophet god said jesus you cannot
[1:33:27] bring a trinity even through the first
[1:33:30] para first uh sorry the first chapter of
[1:33:32] revelations one
[1:33:34] because
[1:33:34] you can't bring it through there
[1:33:36] because it declares there's one person
[1:33:39] hallelujah one distinct individual
[1:33:42] person in the godhead that's right
[1:33:45] in revelations 1 7
[1:33:47] behold he cometh with clouds and every
[1:33:50] eye shall see him and they also which
[1:33:52] pierced him and all kinds of the earth
[1:33:55] shall wail because of him even so amen
[1:33:57] now notice what he says
[1:33:59] christ utters out he says
[1:34:02] what did this man say what did jesus say
[1:34:04] i am the alpha
[1:34:06] and omega
[1:34:08] the beginning
[1:34:09] and the end
[1:34:11] saith the lord
[1:34:12] which is and which was
[1:34:15] and which is to come the only time
[1:34:19] first
[1:34:20] the last
[1:34:22] the very beginning
[1:34:24] amen he's the god of time
[1:34:27] yeah
[1:34:29] that sounds like the time we're in
[1:34:32] the beginning of time started in the
[1:34:34] beginning at the beginning started time
[1:34:36] and then the ending ends time absolutely
[1:34:38] and beyond that he's been beyond that
[1:34:39] absolutely yes
[1:34:41] now
[1:34:43] in revelations
[1:34:45] and 17.
[1:34:47] and when i saw him i fell at his feet as
[1:34:49] dead and he laid his right hand upon me
[1:34:51] saying fear not i am the first
[1:34:55] and the last
[1:34:56] i am he that lived
[1:34:59] and was dead
[1:35:01] and behold i am a leg forever more amen
[1:35:03] and have the keys of hell and death
[1:35:05] right yes look at these declarations
[1:35:09] in those four scriptures he declares
[1:35:10] that he is god that's right that's right
[1:35:13] i'm going to show you something now
[1:35:15] remember this is free trinity this is
[1:35:18] free yes violence when was baptism yes
[1:35:21] pretty close right just studied out he
[1:35:23] found actually early stuff
[1:35:27] but god is putting jesus put this here
[1:35:29] to show that there is only one person
[1:35:32] yes now
[1:35:33] christ
[1:35:35] echoes this
[1:35:36] this is actually an echo
[1:35:38] because it's revealed all the way back
[1:35:40] into isaiah
[1:35:44] you know why he put this there why god
[1:35:45] put this there i am the first and the
[1:35:47] last
[1:35:48] this and this and this
[1:35:50] beginning again
[1:35:53] because there was
[1:35:54] a doctrine coming
[1:35:56] where it separates
[1:35:58] who he is
[1:36:00] yes yes
[1:36:02] now let's pull this up
[1:36:03] if you could saints of god
[1:36:06] this this is beautiful but just you
[1:36:07] might start to know where to go i've
[1:36:10] never seen it before all right isaiah 44
[1:36:13] verse 1.
[1:36:15] look at this
[1:36:18] this is beautiful
[1:36:22] now here yet yet now here he says oh
[1:36:26] jacob my servant
[1:36:28] and israel whom i've chosen
[1:36:31] he's talking sweetly to him he's talking
[1:36:33] sweet
[1:36:34] he's just as a husband to his wife and
[1:36:37] oh he this is me
[1:36:40] thus saith the lord that made thee
[1:36:44] he declares himself as the creator you
[1:36:46] make it and form thee from the williams
[1:36:50] yes
[1:36:50] you mean for me from the womb even after
[1:36:53] the womb
[1:36:54] the kind of person the individual you
[1:36:55] would be god
[1:36:58] every hardship everything you went
[1:37:00] through god had to allow those things to
[1:37:02] mold you into a certain kind of person
[1:37:06] yes you go outside every tree is
[1:37:08] different well this this there's two
[1:37:10] oaks right here they're still different
[1:37:12] yes there's an orange tree over here
[1:37:14] there they're different look at that
[1:37:15] look at the branches one just like this
[1:37:18] but god is a god of variety
[1:37:20] yes he can save
[1:37:23] anything amen amen now notice
[1:37:26] notice this
[1:37:27] thus saith the lord that made thee
[1:37:30] inform thee from the womb
[1:37:31] which will help thee
[1:37:33] fear not o jacob my servant and thou
[1:37:35] just run who my blood now notice he says
[1:37:38] i will pour water upon him that is
[1:37:40] thirsty and flooded upon thy dry ground
[1:37:43] and i'll pour my spirit upon thy seed
[1:37:45] amen that's the same spirit we've
[1:37:47] received amen
[1:37:49] and my blessing upon thine offspring and
[1:37:51] they shall spring up among them as grass
[1:37:53] as well as by the watercourses
[1:37:57] and look at this very next scripture
[1:38:01] and one
[1:38:04] shall say
[1:38:06] i am the lords
[1:38:08] oh yeah and another says
[1:38:10] another shall call himself by the name
[1:38:12] of jacob
[1:38:13] one lord well i'm obviously of jacob's
[1:38:16] branch i'm yielding how jacob got the
[1:38:18] one that dealt with jacob that's that's
[1:38:20] why i'm serving well i'm the lord it's
[1:38:22] at the beginning
[1:38:24] and another shall subscribe with his
[1:38:26] hand unto the lord
[1:38:28] shall write something about the lord on
[1:38:30] his hand
[1:38:31] inserting himself by the name of israel
[1:38:35] notice there was three divisions three
[1:38:37] or four divisions already rising up
[1:38:40] because we notice now
[1:38:42] as god reveals himself continually he
[1:38:45] has all these attributes amen
[1:38:49] he's all these things there's a god that
[1:38:51] heals yes
[1:38:53] was the same god the god of jacob that
[1:38:55] was of abraham
[1:38:57] or was he the same guy that was of jacob
[1:38:59] or in isaac
[1:39:01] was he the same god of joseph
[1:39:03] they're already trying to separate
[1:39:06] and break god up into divisions all
[1:39:08] right so well no well i'm of this one
[1:39:10] now listen i'm a paul i'm a seedless
[1:39:12] algorithm all right all right
[1:39:15] right right
[1:39:18] they were already starting to separate
[1:39:20] why like the god that provides for me
[1:39:21] well i like the god that heals me
[1:39:23] how do we how do we know they're the
[1:39:24] same god
[1:39:29] drop the next scripture
[1:39:33] thus saith the lord the king of israel
[1:39:37] and his redeemer the lord of hosts
[1:39:39] notice he is not only king of israel but
[1:39:41] he is going to redeem them as well
[1:39:44] he is both king and redeemer running the
[1:39:47] same
[1:39:49] he says i am the first and i am the last
[1:39:51] and beside me there is no god amen yes
[1:39:56] notice when christ now notice they're
[1:39:58] saying this they're saying this and god
[1:40:00] drops his thoughts
[1:40:01] hey
[1:40:02] there is no other gods
[1:40:04] the same one that's doing this over here
[1:40:06] the same one that blessed abraham over
[1:40:08] here the same with the blessed jacob
[1:40:10] over here and changed jacob named israel
[1:40:11] he says i'm the very same one amen amen
[1:40:16] and that was the same revelation needed
[1:40:18] in revelations 1.
[1:40:21] glory jesus is the father hallelujah
[1:40:25] he is the holy ghost
[1:40:29] glory
[1:40:31] i love that hallelujah
[1:40:36] says there is no
[1:40:37] then besides me there is no god and who
[1:40:40] as i shall call and declare it and set
[1:40:43] an order for me since i appointed the
[1:40:44] age of each people and the things that
[1:40:46] are coming and shall come and shall shew
[1:40:48] them unto them fury not neither be
[1:40:49] afraid for i've told you from the
[1:40:51] beginning of declaring ye or even my
[1:40:52] witnesses is there a god beside me yeah
[1:40:55] he says there is no god he says i know
[1:40:57] not anything amen
[1:40:59] what these people were saying
[1:41:01] what these people were saying was they
[1:41:03] were already starting to get in their
[1:41:05] minds polytheism
[1:41:07] yes
[1:41:09] that influence because remember there
[1:41:10] was
[1:41:11] thousands and millions of heathen with
[1:41:13] god all right
[1:41:15] and just israel being around them
[1:41:18] hearing of this and this and looking at
[1:41:20] their own scripture that thought those
[1:41:21] thoughts are starting to corrupt their
[1:41:23] understanding of the word of god
[1:41:25] they're starting to crop their minds of
[1:41:27] what the godhead really was
[1:41:30] well i'm of the lord
[1:41:32] and i'm a i'm of jacob well i'm of
[1:41:34] israel
[1:41:36] one this and i'm that saints of god
[1:41:38] only one lord
[1:41:40] jesus christ
[1:41:43] amen
[1:41:44] amen now god had to pull this all the
[1:41:46] way back from there to prove it but he
[1:41:48] pulls this exact
[1:41:50] same scripture from isaiah why because
[1:41:52] we're fighting the same spirits the the
[1:41:55] same demons absolutely that's right and
[1:41:57] he uses the same scripture to fight the
[1:41:59] same spirits
[1:42:04] he's got the one word the exact same
[1:42:06] thing amen amen
[1:42:09] now when i studied this i would probably
[1:42:10] show you a little bit cleaner player
[1:42:11] planer but
[1:42:12] man i was like there it is right there
[1:42:15] beautiful oh man the trinity problem and
[1:42:18] polytheism in the house of god that's a
[1:42:19] brand new thing 2000 years ago
[1:42:21] no it isn't that's right it's been here
[1:42:24] before
[1:42:25] years and years and years
[1:42:29] but notice never really gained strength
[1:42:31] until the gentiles got in here
[1:42:33] amen why we have so many pagan roots so
[1:42:36] amen saints well we're gonna end by the
[1:42:38] grace of god on that note hey man
[1:42:40] we trust with a blessing jesus christ is
[1:42:43] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:42:45] amen now when the lord says something
[1:42:47] he's going to do it
[1:42:49] so you can look you can just i mean if
[1:42:52] you
[1:42:52] you know you don't obviously recommend
[1:42:54] this but you can just close your eyes
[1:42:56] hold the bible hear the scripture and
[1:42:57] it's going to come to pass
[1:42:59] that's right that's right it has been
[1:43:01] spoken of god and it's going to come to
[1:43:02] pass whether you like it or not whether
[1:43:04] i like it or not or however but the
[1:43:06] saints of god is going to have that
[1:43:11] he has revealed to us what is coming
[1:43:15] i'll say it like this
[1:43:17] what
[1:43:18] for the bride of christ and alive in
[1:43:20] this day what is new
[1:43:23] how things do
[1:43:25] we've seen people in the bible get
[1:43:26] resurrected from the dead we've seen
[1:43:28] people not seen death and go up so where
[1:43:30] do we have the fear right if god's
[1:43:32] spoken there's a bride that's not going
[1:43:33] to see death
[1:43:35] we all have to do is go back in the
[1:43:36] scripture and find through already he's
[1:43:38] already done that right right and what
[1:43:40] about our loved ones who passed on our
[1:43:42] grandpas and grandmas and those who were
[1:43:44] christian they might not have heard the
[1:43:46] word of god they may have been baptized
[1:43:47] wrong this but they died in christ amen
[1:43:49] they might have the holy ghost before
[1:43:51] the revelation is struck
[1:43:53] they'll be there as well amen
[1:43:55] so we have nothing to fear that's right
[1:43:57] jesus said constantly in the scriptures
[1:43:59] fear not
[1:44:01] fear not
[1:44:02] yes hey man so
[1:44:04] anyhow a god of demonstration
[1:44:08] he shows you what he's going to do
[1:44:09] before he does it and then he does it
[1:44:12] yes amen if there is anyone that needs
[1:44:15] any prayer i know it's a simple study
[1:44:17] beautiful
[1:44:21] there is nothing new under the sun
[1:44:25] the divisions have always been in the
[1:44:27] you see satan
[1:44:29] already trying to remember if you study
[1:44:32] the true change book
[1:44:33] that trinity doctrine started all the
[1:44:35] way back with kush that's right right
[1:44:37] brother which was in what god sees mine
[1:44:39] or no not no
[1:44:41] but it actually
[1:44:42] moved on
[1:44:44] and it was influencing the people even
[1:44:46] back here for whatever reason the devil
[1:44:50] was always trying to do that great god
[1:44:52] up in the three that's that's the
[1:44:54] revelation that's the mystery of
[1:44:56] matthew 13 33 i believe and there's a
[1:44:59] woman and
[1:45:00] a full head had some meal and she broke
[1:45:02] it up into three sections and injected
[1:45:05] leaven into it who is that all right
[1:45:07] brother yes
[1:45:08] amen who else did that who took the meal
[1:45:10] the word of god or god himself and
[1:45:13] divided him up in the free park come
[1:45:15] just like that jewish man told the
[1:45:17] prophet he said you can't break up god
[1:45:18] in the three he says we know he's lord
[1:45:20] amen
[1:45:22] amen so
[1:45:24] let's our heads need prayer
[1:45:26] on anything god is able
[1:45:29] more than able to play
[1:45:31] saints players and singers and

[1:45:49] study but i just that's how i am i love
[1:45:51] teaching this stuff hallelujah by the
[1:45:53] grace of god what he brings forth and we
[1:45:55] reveal
