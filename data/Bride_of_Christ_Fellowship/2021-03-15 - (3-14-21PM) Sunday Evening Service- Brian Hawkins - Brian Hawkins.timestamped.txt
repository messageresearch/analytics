[19:02] let's remember um
[19:06] uh brother amen has another unspoken
[19:09] request he and i talked about sister who
[19:10] had talked about it for their family
[19:13] let's pray for a hedge of protection on
[19:15] uh some of
[19:16] hua and amon's family members very
[19:18] important
[19:19] uh we pray for that also let's remember
[19:22] my brother simon
[19:23] he's building an apartment for his
[19:25] sister-in-law
[19:28] so let's remember strength for our
[19:30] brother
[19:32] lydia has a friend whose great-grandma
[19:34] has stage four cancer
[19:37] so we'll just pray for that situation
[19:41] if god will be merciful to heal this
[19:43] elderly woman but
[19:46] that gods will be done and also let's
[19:49] remember uh salvation for
[19:50] loved ones and lost loved ones
[19:54] the children still want to pray for a 17
[19:56] year old brian who came a couple
[19:58] weeks ago they want to remember him in

[20:21] how many have unspoken and say lord

[20:25] god's word
[20:26] or remember me lord i remember my
[20:28] requests in prayer
[20:32] hallelujah
[20:37] i think when brother brian was preaching
[20:38] this morning uh you know he talked about
[20:40] again waiting for a time in season for
[20:42] god to answer prayers and i know that
[20:44] was speaking to me there's things i want

[20:47] i feel like if i've asked god that i
[20:50] just got to be patient wait for the time
[20:51] and season

[39:07] amen are you free this evening amen
[39:11] thank you musicians man it sounds so
[39:14] good in there
[39:16] this blesses my soul amen
[39:19] if you would turn with me in the first
[39:21] corinthians
[39:22] uh chapter eight and
[39:28] this is something that my family's
[39:30] already heard me speak on and i don't
[39:31] know if johnny and sarah got to hear it
[39:33] or not but
[39:34] so my apologies if it's a repeat
[39:38] but uh that song brother amen started
[39:42] singing i don't even know what song it
[39:44] was it was another new song for me
[39:47] you know i think it's in psalms it says
[39:50] sing a new song unto the lord every time
[39:52] i come here i hear a new song
[39:55] and there are several several new ones
[39:57] that i've heard today
[39:58] but uh just thank the lord for his grace
[40:02] amen um but when he started singing that
[40:06] i
[40:06] i couldn't help but just start crying
[40:08] back there because it just led
[40:10] right into what i was saying this
[40:11] morning just leaned right into
[40:13] into the message so i just appreciate it
[40:16] and uh
[40:17] god bless you all i hope this is a
[40:19] blessing to you
[40:20] uh first corinthians chapter eight and
[40:22] verse 2.
[40:25] it says that if any man think that he
[40:28] knoweth anything
[40:30] he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to
[40:33] know
[40:34] you know god humbled kings
[40:38] for thinking that they were something
[40:41] and if he would humble kings how much
[40:44] more
[40:44] you and i right there no
[40:47] god is no respecter of persons yes man
[40:50] so
[40:51] we can expect the same thing um
[40:56] so let's look to the lord in prayer most
[40:59] gracious heavenly father
[41:00] we just thank you for again everything
[41:03] that you do for us lord we can never
[41:06] it might seem redundant to some people
[41:07] but we can never thank you enough for
[41:09] what you've done for us
[41:10] but just the grace that you've extended
[41:12] to us when we're so undeserving
[41:15] you know lord just let you
[41:18] an unending love and it's an amazing
[41:21] grace oh god
[41:22] we just thank you for that and just
[41:23] these songs that we try to sing to
[41:26] to sing an honor to you and to give you
[41:29] praise and to
[41:31] uh give you glory and just
[41:34] the best that we can to express how we
[41:36] feel for what you've done for us oh god
[41:39] and uh lord as we get into the message
[41:42] this evening i just pray that you would
[41:44] help me
[41:44] minister to your people i pray that it's
[41:46] a blessing to them and uh
[41:48] lord i just want to lift your name on
[41:51] high
[41:51] and uh just give you praise and i just
[41:54] want to talk about you tonight
[41:56] i just pray that you would help me do
[41:58] that and maybe rejoice
[42:00] in your word in jesus christ's name we
[42:02] pray amen
[42:03] amen you may be seated thank you
[42:12] as we read in first corinthians if any
[42:15] man think he knoweth anything he knoweth
[42:16] nothing
[42:18] yet as he ought to know and this
[42:21] scripture
[42:22] really hits home to me um you all don't
[42:25] know
[42:26] who he was uh there's only i think
[42:28] brother johnny
[42:29] might have did you know brother gayle
[42:31] keller for the polls
[42:33] then but when i was
[42:37] i just came uh i
[42:40] just i was just born again just gave my
[42:42] heart to the lord and
[42:44] uh i started hanging around him a little
[42:46] bit more i got closer to him and he's
[42:48] he was one of those old soldiers you
[42:49] know and uh
[42:51] just to enjoy sitting
[42:55] and talking to him before he has he had
[42:57] so much wisdom
[42:59] and that was one thing that he said uh
[43:01] several times
[43:02] you know if somebody of that
[43:05] caliber with that much wisdom repeats
[43:08] something it's it's worth remembering
[43:10] and uh so i i think this has helped me a
[43:13] lot
[43:13] uh with my walk with christ anyways
[43:16] uh to keep me humble and
[43:21] you know just to how to treat people
[43:24] so you know uh
[43:27] and try to keep a a good spirit you know
[43:29] because we
[43:30] we might do uh some good things uh
[43:34] here and there uh but we sure don't want
[43:36] to brag about it you know
[43:38] so we tend to think more of ourselves as
[43:41] as
[43:41] uh people to to be more than
[43:45] what we ought to think uh we have some
[43:48] good days where we feel that we're on
[43:49] top of the world and
[43:51] uh we might have had the best game of
[43:53] our lives
[43:54] we may have scored more points in a game
[43:56] or or won more consec
[43:59] consecutive games and than anyone else
[44:01] you know they have the olympics out
[44:02] there
[44:03] that that they try to win medals and
[44:06] when you win
[44:07] the gold medal you kind of have bragging
[44:09] rights as they say but
[44:10] uh that's not something we don't strive
[44:13] we don't walk
[44:14] uh to attain a a worldly metal a thing
[44:18] of this
[44:19] an earthly metal but we but we strive to
[44:23] uh continue to earn the uh heavenly
[44:26] reward amen
[44:27] so uh that's that's why we have to put
[44:30] our whole heart into it you know
[44:31] an olympian uh when they're when they're
[44:34] training their their training they put
[44:36] their whole heart into it they put their
[44:37] whole
[44:38] lives into it they're dedicated to it
[44:40] they're focused on it and
[44:41] and they they sacrificed just so they
[44:44] could become the best person so they can
[44:46] win that gold medal
[44:48] but we're not striving to be the best
[44:50] we're just
[44:51] like brother like we uh read this
[44:53] morning where brother bannon said
[44:54] that the people were separating because
[44:56] one was saying oh he's coming on a white
[44:58] cloud oh no he's coming on a white horse
[45:00] what does it matter how he's coming as
[45:02] long as he's coming
[45:04] and we ought to be ready for that so
[45:05] it's it's it's not
[45:08] it's not who's the best it's helping one
[45:10] another alone to
[45:11] to meet the same you know it's a prize
[45:13] worth fighting for amen
[45:14] amen oh so we and what they what
[45:18] we do as people what the olympians do is
[45:20] they they
[45:21] break uh other people's records that
[45:23] have been set uh over the course of
[45:26] however long they've been doing olympics
[45:27] i think they even had it back in
[45:29] in the uh the roman empire they had the
[45:32] olympics and stuff so
[45:34] uh people will still strive these
[45:38] olympians strive
[45:39] their focus is to beat the other
[45:41] person's record not just to win the
[45:42] medal but they're there to try to
[45:44] break records to be the fastest uh the
[45:46] be
[45:47] the highest jumper the best swordsman
[45:49] whatev whatever it might be
[45:50] they're always trying to break a record
[45:52] uh
[45:54] so when we have those good days if if we
[45:56] were to break
[45:57] somebody's record we uh we we think of
[46:00] ourselves ha ha
[46:02] i'm somebody i broke that record you
[46:04] know i'm the best there is people are
[46:05] just going to
[46:06] praise me because i'm so so good well
[46:09] well guess what
[46:10] there's always going to be somebody
[46:12] that's uh they're going to come out on
[46:14] their best day
[46:15] and and break a record uh so
[46:19] what lake did they have to stand on so
[46:21] to speak that that they could
[46:23] sit there and brag about being the best
[46:25] when somebody else can come right along
[46:27] and and beat that same record uh we tend
[46:30] to brag about
[46:31] how good looking we might be uh some
[46:34] people just spend so much time in the
[46:35] mirror and
[46:36] you know spend a couple times a couple
[46:39] hours
[46:39] you know just getting ready and i'm
[46:42] talking guys some
[46:43] some girls might take a little bit
[46:44] longer in a couple hours but you know
[46:46] guys sitting in the mirror a little too
[46:47] long that's a little vain
[46:49] but you know uh because they're just
[46:51] trying to make themselves look so good
[46:52] and for what
[46:54] you know just to make all the girls say
[46:55] oh he's so cute
[46:57] yeah and uh he's the cutest of the bunch
[47:00] and
[47:00] and the girls well i'm the prettiest one
[47:02] that they ever did see
[47:03] you know something like that so you know
[47:06] what what what are we doing that for
[47:10] but there's going to be some day they
[47:11] have these beauty pageants
[47:13] uh in our country and and i think even
[47:16] miss
[47:17] universe they they even have those so
[47:18] it's a world
[47:20] uh worldwide thing a modeling of who the
[47:22] prettiest woman and
[47:23] just like i said i was talking this
[47:25] morning it's the way that you don't
[47:27] really see
[47:28] men out there modeling like like the
[47:30] women
[47:31] like the women do i mean they have their
[47:33] their muscle things you know
[47:34] the strongest man and you know that
[47:37] well i don't want to get too much into
[47:39] that but they've got their competitions
[47:41] too
[47:43] so all along the lines uh people are
[47:46] trying to be
[47:46] better than the other one so and and
[47:49] that's why i'm coming out with this
[47:50] scripture this evening that if any man
[47:52] think he knoweth anything he knows
[47:54] nothing
[47:55] as yet as he ought to know uh
[48:01] kind of getting back onto the the beauty
[48:04] thing
[48:07] just like the records when when records
[48:09] are set they're only there for a little
[48:10] bit just like beauty that's only there
[48:12] for a little bit too because
[48:13] but what happens it's it's a progressive
[48:16] degradation
[48:17] or also known as age
[48:21] every day we get a little bit older and
[48:23] beauty can fade away
[48:26] for the most part on the on the outside
[48:30] you take a teenager or a young 20 year
[48:33] old woman
[48:34] at the prime of her life she might be
[48:36] the most beautiful at that point in time
[48:38] but by the time she hits
[48:40] 50 60 she doesn't look like what she did
[48:42] at 20 years old
[48:44] because of the stress of the world that
[48:46] comes and different things happen in
[48:48] people's lives and
[48:49] and uh that i've kind of talked about
[48:52] this
[48:53] to my wife that you know i see some of
[48:55] my peers that
[48:56] uh i graduated with
[48:59] and somehow by god's grace it just seems
[49:02] like we're holding our
[49:03] our youth a little bit better than some
[49:05] you know i'm not trying to
[49:08] i'm just saying that uh you could see
[49:12] because it could be struggles of life
[49:14] that have
[49:15] come across the people that uh it just
[49:17] looks like they've had a real
[49:18] hard go uh
[49:22] so all that all that is vain when you're
[49:25] so concentrated on the outside beauty
[49:27] because it's the inside it's the inward
[49:29] man that we should be working on more
[49:31] than the outward
[49:32] uh so we want to uh we want to leave a
[49:35] legacy of the
[49:36] the inside man
[49:42] that's why uh i think now
[49:45] when samuel went to go uh anoint david
[49:48] what did he say look not
[49:50] on the outward appearance but it's but
[49:52] god looks on the inside
[49:54] uh so that's what we want to work on and
[49:56] that's that's what we want to
[49:58] concentrate on is that inside man
[50:01] now we might tend to uh brag about how
[50:04] good of a job we do
[50:06] where everyone depends on you and
[50:10] you've had so much training you've had
[50:11] so much experience and that's why you
[50:13] get paid the most and
[50:15] you know i've i've heard people brag
[50:17] about stuff like that you know
[50:18] well okay you've been here longer you
[50:20] know
[50:23] do you wanna want us all to clap and
[50:26] cheer and you know
[50:28] uh that i just don't know what some
[50:30] people's uh
[50:33] motive is behind that to to just stand
[50:36] there and brag about
[50:37] uh something like that and that just
[50:38] seems so trivial but everybody has
[50:40] something that they
[50:42] uh that they're proud of you know and
[50:44] it's okay to be proud of an
[50:45] accomplishment
[50:46] because it helps you to work harder to
[50:48] make it to accomplish
[50:50] uh something else you know we don't want
[50:53] to be just
[50:54] just satisfied like we were talking this
[50:55] morning we don't want to just get
[50:57] so far and be satisfied and not continue
[50:59] on we want to continue on
[51:08] oh
[51:11] we tend to
[51:16] uh yeah we tend to brag about our cars
[51:20] right our vehicles or
[51:22] bicycle or our way of travel uh
[51:25] i remember hot rods were a big thing
[51:27] back when i was younger i was
[51:29] yeah my brother was into it so it kind
[51:31] of influenced me to
[51:32] you know be into the cars and i knew
[51:34] some here and there
[51:36] but uh and just to hear the the nice
[51:39] roaring you know the of the muscle cars
[51:41] just a
[51:42] uh just a rumble that it made it was it
[51:45] was just something wonderful
[51:47] it was just great to hear i don't know
[51:49] why but men just like that women like it
[51:51] too but
[51:52] i think there's more men that like that
[51:53] than the women do
[51:55] but but i i'm going to brag about my
[51:58] about my vehicles i've got a
[52:00] i've got an old-time chariot waiting to
[52:01] come and take me home amen
[52:03] that's the kind of vehicle i want to
[52:04] brag about so uh
[52:07] i have a lot of scripture this evening
[52:09] uh and there's no way that i'm gonna be
[52:11] able to cover it all
[52:12] uh it might seem like i'm jumping from
[52:15] thing to thing
[52:17] but what i i just want to talk about the
[52:19] lord this evening if that's
[52:20] that's all right so brother branham says
[52:23] this he says
[52:24] and this is at thy word lord he says so
[52:26] don't think of money
[52:28] don't think of homes and land think of
[52:31] christ who is coming
[52:32] amen there's nobody can put hopes in
[52:35] anything else
[52:36] but christ now not sometime later down
[52:40] the road
[52:41] and we're not thinking of him sometime
[52:43] past but we have to think of him
[52:45] now uh in the present you know when when
[52:48] uh he was speaking when moses was
[52:50] talking to him or god was telling him to
[52:52] go down into egypt
[52:53] uh and moses said uh well who shall i
[52:56] atone that sent me
[52:58] you know what name can i call him he
[53:00] says tell him that i
[53:02] am now i am is right now in the present
[53:05] and not i was or i'm going to be he says
[53:07] i am
[53:08] so we want to focus on christ now
[53:12] uh he says that's right everything our
[53:15] whole future
[53:16] is on the coming of the lord our whole
[53:19] future is on the coming of the lord
[53:22] that's right that's the hope of those
[53:24] who are asleep
[53:26] and of we who are alive
[53:30] but he should be uh our our focus
[53:33] uh like the
[53:38] i can't think of the name of the company
[53:39] like that man uh told the woman that
[53:42] and i can never remember it anytime i
[53:43] tell this story i'm not a good
[53:45] storyteller i'm terrible at it but
[53:47] uh that man they
[53:50] he came in he told the woman he says i'm
[53:51] gonna come back for you in one year
[53:54] and all the other women were all
[53:56] primping themselves and and trying to be
[53:58] the
[53:58] the winner of his heart and stuff you
[54:00] know but it was a humble one that was in
[54:02] the kitchen taking care of things the
[54:04] one that won his heart over
[54:05] that's what he was looking for uh not
[54:07] somebody who was spending so much time
[54:09] on themselves
[54:10] print primping themselves up like the
[54:11] world does you know but
[54:13] just a humble woman so she didn't
[54:17] she didn't wait until the last minute
[54:19] well he's going to be coming
[54:20] next week i better start getting my my
[54:22] wedding garment ready
[54:23] no she prepared that whole year to get
[54:26] ready for that time
[54:27] because she had faith that he was going
[54:29] to come back for her
[54:30] on that day and which he fulfilled that
[54:32] promise that he was there to the date
[54:34] one year so even though she was railed
[54:38] on even though we're getting railed on
[54:40] you might get railed on well you believe
[54:41] that stuff in a rapture the
[54:43] you know rapture is not even in the
[54:44] bible you're and they're absolutely
[54:46] right the word rapture is not in the
[54:48] in the bible but the same definition is
[54:51] uh
[54:52] we will be caught up rapture means
[54:54] caught up
[54:55] so uh some people might think that we
[54:59] focus too much on on the rapture but
[55:01] that's that's what i'm looking forward
[55:02] to that's
[55:03] that's we're pressing toward the mark of
[55:04] the high calling and i can't think of
[55:06] any higher calling than that to be
[55:08] raptured away amen
[55:14] we tend to brag that we're the smartest
[55:16] thing that ever came along
[55:18] since a computer these are just some
[55:20] thoughts that i had written down
[55:22] but it turns out they were we're still
[55:24] equal with the marshmallow stick you
[55:25] know
[55:26] and they did a study of uh the human
[55:28] brain i can't even remember what
[55:30] percentage they said that we use it's
[55:31] like 10
[55:32] of our brain capacity that we even use
[55:34] so how smart are we that we
[55:36] really think that we are you know
[55:38] they're it's just mass
[55:40] [Music]
[55:41] 10 or i can't remember i think that's
[55:45] what it is
[55:46] but still my goodness okay imagine what
[55:49] we can accomplish
[55:51] think of what we could destroy if we
[55:53] used 80 of our
[55:54] our brains just think of all mankind
[55:56] being destroyed with that
[55:58] uh you know because we we've got the
[56:00] atomic bombs we've got nuclear stuff
[56:02] and uh you know and it's all to destroy
[56:04] the other guy
[56:05] uh so what you know brother bran i
[56:07] remember he was preaching the one
[56:09] message i can't remember what it was and
[56:11] he was talking about the intelligence
[56:12] and ban
[56:13] okay so well what are they going to do
[56:15] with this you know what are they going
[56:16] to do with that
[56:17] and they're not going to be satisfied
[56:19] until they're the only ones standing
[56:20] okay
[56:21] and then what do you have after that
[56:22] that's going to be quite lonely when
[56:23] you're here by yourself
[56:25] you know since you conquered everybody
[56:29] see when man thinks he knows something
[56:31] he'll find out sooner or later that he
[56:32] really doesn't know what he
[56:33] what he should uh sometimes it takes the
[56:36] experience
[56:37] of the deathbed or of a fatal condition
[56:40] to make a man reflect on his life and
[56:42] and feel regret that he didn't perform
[56:44] the way that he should have
[56:46] you know how many stories have we heard
[56:48] that oh man i should have done this when
[56:50] i was younger
[56:51] i should have done this i should have
[56:52] lived for the lord uh better
[56:55] you know and it seems to come when the
[56:57] person is on their deathbed
[56:59] and uh man what did i and they started
[57:02] apologizing to everybody
[57:04] you know there was a guy that i worked
[57:05] with uh
[57:07] and he was he was kind of cruel uh he
[57:10] just wasn't a very nice man
[57:12] and he would tell you things and he
[57:14] didn't care how you felt about it
[57:16] but when he found out he had cancer
[57:19] and that he wasn't he didn't have much
[57:21] longer to live
[57:23] just like what i was saying he went
[57:24] around the whole plant and he was
[57:25] apologizing to everybody he could
[57:27] and something changes a man when he's
[57:30] faced with his greatest fear
[57:32] of death there's something about it that
[57:36] when a man is faced with no longer
[57:38] existing
[57:39] he starts thinking about on his ways you
[57:41] know so that's why
[57:43] we say now is the time to focus on
[57:46] christ
[57:46] perform live for christ now don't wait
[57:49] well
[57:49] i'll live for him once i've once i've
[57:51] made these accomplishments
[57:52] well you'll make those accomplishments
[57:54] if you're in the will of god
[57:56] if it's not his will and guess what
[57:58] you're probably not going to make that
[57:59] accomplishment to begin with no matter
[58:00] how hard you you struggle for it
[58:02] if you're one of god's and he doesn't
[58:04] want you to go that way you know
[58:06] he'll probably just throw those
[58:07] roadblocks right right in front of you
[58:09] so you can't make it there
[58:10] he might make you break your leg he
[58:12] might paralyze you to get get your
[58:13] attention i
[58:14] don't whatever it might be you know uh
[58:17] we've heard stories like that too
[58:19] uh people that were going somewhere and
[58:20] then all of a sudden life just comes to
[58:23] a stop there
[58:23] they have a life-altering experience
[58:26] that gets their mind thinking
[58:27] finally they start thinking about god oh
[58:34] excuse me
[58:38] things that matter the most we don't pay
[58:39] attention to and the things that matter
[58:41] little
[58:42] tend to get our attention
[58:45] you know they have a they have a drug
[58:47] for everything
[58:50] i mean they have a drug pretty much for
[58:52] everything
[58:53] uh just because
[58:58] because we want things fixed you know
[59:00] yeah some medicine is good i
[59:02] i'm grateful for the medicine that i've
[59:04] had over the years you know it's helped
[59:06] out a lot whether it's pain medication
[59:07] or
[59:08] or something else to to help with the
[59:10] healing process
[59:12] but to have you know if you're sleepy
[59:14] they've got a drug to keep you awake
[59:16] and if you can't sleep they got a drug
[59:20] to make you go to sleep
[59:22] uh if you got a slow heart they've got a
[59:24] uh they've got a pill out there to speed
[59:26] your heart up if your heart's beating
[59:27] too fast they got a pill to slow it down
[59:29] they pretty much have a pill for
[59:31] everything but they don't have the pill
[59:33] of the fountain of youth and they still
[59:35] can't find that fountain of youth
[59:38] if they just go to church they might
[59:39] find the fountain of youth amen
[59:43] so and it's just the intelligence of man
[59:47] that that makes these chemicals or or
[59:49] builds these bombs or whatever
[59:51] so some of it has uh a good purpose
[59:54] behind it it has a good motive because
[59:56] there
[59:56] there are smart men out there men that
[59:58] are way smarter than me
[1:00:00] and i wouldn't know how to come up with
[1:00:01] uh
[1:00:03] with what's that uh the mold uh
[1:00:06] the antibiotic penicillin yeah i
[1:00:09] couldn't come up with no penicillin
[1:00:11] you know and how long did it take them
[1:00:13] to come up with that but it's a lot of
[1:00:14] research and a lot of lab work
[1:00:16] and a lot of trial and error i probably
[1:00:19] just don't have the patience for that
[1:00:20] but see i fix phones sometimes too and
[1:00:22] people say i don't have the patience for
[1:00:24] that
[1:00:24] well i don't have the patience to work
[1:00:25] in a lab you know
[1:00:28] plus i don't have that intelligence but
[1:00:36] excuse me but people will just turn to
[1:00:39] anything to combat the pull of god you
[1:00:42] know we've we've heard that a person has
[1:00:43] to fight their way to hell how many has
[1:00:45] heard that you know
[1:00:46] we literally have to fight our way to
[1:00:48] hell you know because god is
[1:00:50] god has made a wave for us
[1:00:53] and it it's all up to us whether we
[1:00:56] accept that way or not is that right
[1:00:58] so uh that that story of the man that
[1:01:00] was pardoned by abraham lincoln that
[1:01:02] uh he refused it uh and and they he went
[1:01:05] before the firing squad and they
[1:01:08] it went to what congress or something
[1:01:10] like that well how did this happen he
[1:01:11] was pardoned
[1:01:12] and they concluded that a pardon is not
[1:01:14] a pardon unless it's accepted as a
[1:01:16] pardon so just because
[1:01:18] it was given the person has to accept it
[1:01:20] amen so the same thing with god we could
[1:01:22] tell people until we're blue in the face
[1:01:24] look you can be free in in the name of
[1:01:26] jesus christ you know
[1:01:27] there's freedom in in in the gospel you
[1:01:30] know
[1:01:30] but until they accept that gospel
[1:01:34] they won't receive it and like we talked
[1:01:36] this morning
[1:01:37] not everybody uh can see it
[1:01:40] right so we try to satisfy our own
[1:01:42] desires we brag about ourselves and
[1:01:44] and put our importance uh above someone
[1:01:46] else that's just kind of human nature
[1:01:48] uh kind of like the the alpha male type
[1:01:51] thing the
[1:01:52] the survival of the fittest the survival
[1:01:54] of the strongest
[1:01:56] now see we were born in sin and shaped
[1:01:59] in iniquity and come into the world
[1:02:00] speaking lies
[1:02:02] humanity is vanity is that right so
[1:02:05] in our humanity we we try so hard uh
[1:02:09] to do something that we and and for what
[1:02:11] it's for not
[1:02:12] it's for nothing uh like we said about
[1:02:14] the olympians they strive to
[1:02:15] to earn a gold medal yeah okay you got a
[1:02:18] good medal yeah you're a fast runner
[1:02:20] you're a high jumper whatever
[1:02:21] whatever it might be you know and and
[1:02:24] and
[1:02:25] i don't want to downplay it but you know
[1:02:27] because they they work at it they
[1:02:29] they're really focused on it but okay
[1:02:31] you got a medal
[1:02:32] what are you going to do with the metal
[1:02:33] you're just going to hang it up and say
[1:02:34] look what i did
[1:02:36] you know i've got trophies from and i'm
[1:02:39] sure brother jesse's got trophies i'm
[1:02:40] sure johnny's got trophies i don't know
[1:02:42] anybody else here who's done sports or
[1:02:44] anything but uh
[1:02:46] where where are trophies
[1:02:50] i know mine are sitting in a box
[1:02:51] somewhere
[1:02:53] i've saved them for for whatever
[1:02:56] nostalgic reasons or
[1:02:57] or sentimental value but they're hidden
[1:03:00] in a box
[1:03:01] so what are we going to do with it what
[1:03:02] are they going to do with the metal
[1:03:04] they're just going to
[1:03:05] put it on display and just say wow look
[1:03:07] what i did
[1:03:08] but maybe in our hearts that we could
[1:03:11] leave a legacy look what the lord did
[1:03:13] look what the lord has done for me amen
[1:03:15] let that be our testimony
[1:03:18] let's see uh second corinthians chapter
[1:03:20] four and seven it says
[1:03:22] but we have this treasure in earthen
[1:03:25] vessels is that right if you have the
[1:03:26] holy spirit we have this
[1:03:28] this treasure in earthen vessels that
[1:03:30] the excellency
[1:03:31] of the power may be of
[1:03:34] who of god
[1:03:38] and not of us so we want to
[1:03:42] exalt god not exalt man we want to lift
[1:03:45] him up we want to give him praise we
[1:03:46] want to give him glory is that right
[1:03:48] so acts chapter 4 and verse 10 this is
[1:03:52] peter speaking he says
[1:03:53] be it known unto you all and to all the
[1:03:55] people of israel
[1:03:57] that by the name of jesus christ of
[1:03:58] nazareth whom ye crucified
[1:04:00] whom god raised from the dead even by
[1:04:02] him
[1:04:04] dot this man stand here before you whole
[1:04:06] this is the stone which was said it not
[1:04:08] of you builders which has become the
[1:04:10] head of the corner
[1:04:12] neither is there salvation in any other
[1:04:17] for there is none other name under
[1:04:19] heaven given among men
[1:04:21] whereby we must be saved
[1:04:24] and that's what i'd like to speak on
[1:04:25] this evening is there's none
[1:04:28] like him amen so uh
[1:04:31] like i said i can't cover it all i'm
[1:04:33] just going to go through some
[1:04:35] things in the scriptures and i just want
[1:04:38] to exalt him that's all i just want to
[1:04:39] talk about him
[1:04:40] i want to brag on him a little bit yeah
[1:04:42] so
[1:04:44] uh there was uh there was no one like
[1:04:49] him before
[1:04:49] you know we know uh before time he can
[1:04:52] we know that uh
[1:04:54] he wasn't even known as god because god
[1:04:57] the definition of god is an object of
[1:05:00] worship so
[1:05:02] uh there was no one there to worship him
[1:05:05] right
[1:05:05] so no one existed before him he started
[1:05:08] the existence
[1:05:09] even even the hebrews they they didn't
[1:05:11] even know what to call him and they they
[1:05:13] held his name so sacred that they didn't
[1:05:15] even
[1:05:15] they didn't even really write it down we
[1:05:18] know it as
[1:05:19] yahweh uh we know him as jehovah we know
[1:05:23] him as elohim
[1:05:24] uh and there are many different names
[1:05:26] that we put
[1:05:27] uh to god and like i said moses didn't
[1:05:30] really know what to call him
[1:05:31] but god told him to tell him that i am
[1:05:36] so in revelations uh chapter one and
[1:05:40] verse seven
[1:05:42] his existence didn't begin in bethlehem
[1:05:44] either
[1:05:48] i know it's not christmas time but you
[1:05:49] know
[1:05:52] you know i thank god that he was born
[1:05:54] but
[1:05:55] that that's not what saved me you know
[1:05:56] that's not where he started
[1:05:58] his existence you know he always was uh
[1:06:01] just the just the flesh man that's
[1:06:02] that's where he started his existence
[1:06:04] but revelations chapter 1 and verse 7 it
[1:06:06] says
[1:06:07] behold he cometh with clouds and every
[1:06:10] eye shall see him
[1:06:11] and they also which pierced him oh my
[1:06:15] yep they're going to be there too
[1:06:18] and all kindreds of the earth shall wail
[1:06:21] because of him
[1:06:22] even so amen he says it says i am alpha
[1:06:26] and omega the beginning and the ending
[1:06:29] saith the lord which is
[1:06:30] and which was and which is to come the
[1:06:33] almighty
[1:06:35] you know he asked job one time in job 38
[1:06:40] probably all of the children in here
[1:06:42] could quote it for me
[1:06:46] and verse 4 it says where was i when i
[1:06:48] laid the foundations of the earth
[1:06:50] declare if thou standing
[1:06:52] who hath laid the measures thereof if
[1:06:54] thou knowest
[1:06:55] or who has stretched the line upon it
[1:06:57] whereupon are the foundations they're of
[1:06:59] fastened
[1:07:00] or who laid the cornerstone thereof when
[1:07:02] the morning stars sang together
[1:07:04] and all the sons of god shouted for joy
[1:07:06] job can you tell me where were you
[1:07:09] if you think you know so much why don't
[1:07:11] you tell me a little bit about creation
[1:07:15] if we think we know so much why don't we
[1:07:17] tell people about salvation
[1:07:19] amen now notice job's response after
[1:07:23] after god's rebuke in job 40 says
[1:07:26] moreover the lord
[1:07:27] answered job and said
[1:07:31] shall he that contendeth with the
[1:07:33] almighty instruct him
[1:07:34] who's going to instruct god who knows so
[1:07:37] much that they're going to instruct god
[1:07:39] well god i'm going to do it this way
[1:07:41] because this is going to be the way that
[1:07:42] it's going to work out better for
[1:07:44] my benefit so see we put the focus on us
[1:07:47] so he that reproveth god let him
[1:07:50] answer it then job answered the lord and
[1:07:53] said now notice this humility here he
[1:07:55] said behold
[1:07:56] i am vile what shall i answer thee
[1:08:00] i will lay my hand upon my mouth because
[1:08:02] he realized that he spoke out of turn
[1:08:04] and what he was saying just wasn't
[1:08:07] it just wasn't right he says once have i
[1:08:09] spoken
[1:08:10] but i will not answer yea
[1:08:13] twice but i will proceed no further he
[1:08:15] says i'm pretty much just going to shut
[1:08:17] up right now
[1:08:18] you know because i can't get anywhere
[1:08:20] with this one so
[1:08:21] a man that thinks he knows anything he
[1:08:23] doesn't know what he ought you know
[1:08:25] so we get so high and mighty and we
[1:08:27] think that we know better than god we
[1:08:28] try to put our wisdom above his
[1:08:31] when he said my ways are higher than
[1:08:33] your ways
[1:08:34] and my thoughts than your thoughts
[1:08:37] there's just no one like him
[1:08:38] is there there's just no one like him
[1:08:40] there was no one like him in birth
[1:08:42] in creation god took a motherless woman
[1:08:45] eve out of the body of a man
[1:08:50] adam in redemption
[1:08:53] he took a fatherless man out of the body
[1:08:55] of a woman mary
[1:08:57] the man jesus was born contrary to the
[1:09:00] laws of nature being born of a virgin
[1:09:02] woman let me say that again
[1:09:04] in creation god took a motherless woman
[1:09:08] eve out of the body of man but
[1:09:12] in redemption he took a fatherless man
[1:09:15] out of the body of a woman mary who
[1:09:21] who knows the mind of god amen
[1:09:24] i haven't really heard of anyone else
[1:09:27] you know uh
[1:09:28] being virgin born is that right um
[1:09:31] i've read about claims from other
[1:09:33] religions from uh that their savior was
[1:09:35] born through a virgin birth
[1:09:37] uh but i didn't find anything uh
[1:09:39] definitive
[1:09:41] brother jesse i don't know if you've
[1:09:43] studied other religions or not but
[1:09:45] uh there are other ones that claim that
[1:09:47] that their
[1:09:48] savior was virgin born which turns out
[1:09:51] that it wasn't
[1:09:52] true but they all want to put that claim
[1:09:55] out there
[1:09:55] you know we we know in isaiah that
[1:09:57] there's a virgin shall conceive
[1:10:00] so with if other people knew that well
[1:10:02] we've got to fulfill something like that
[1:10:03] well
[1:10:04] we got to compete with the other one
[1:10:05] down the road you know uh kind of like
[1:10:07] we were what we were talking this
[1:10:08] morning when somebody paints their house
[1:10:10] their porch steps somebody else is going
[1:10:12] to have it too
[1:10:12] so i think brother brother brandon
[1:10:15] taught the
[1:10:16] uh talked about the the young boy i
[1:10:18] think his name was david or something
[1:10:20] a little young preacher like 12 years
[1:10:22] old or something like that he went out
[1:10:24] preaching
[1:10:24] well that was such a hot hit that all
[1:10:26] these other churches went out to try to
[1:10:27] get these 12 year old boys out there
[1:10:29] preaching too
[1:10:30] you know it was they wanted to stay
[1:10:32] competitive but they were
[1:10:33] after the wrong thing amen if they'd
[1:10:36] have just prayed a little bit and got in
[1:10:38] the presence of god they'd
[1:10:39] they'd have had the move of god amen
[1:10:41] amen
[1:10:42] but he caused havoc and fear among kings
[1:10:45] uh while still in the womb of a woman to
[1:10:47] the point
[1:10:48] of killing killing innocent uh infants
[1:10:51] and toddlers
[1:10:51] we know that herod was so tossed about
[1:10:53] when they when the wise man came
[1:10:55] came and said we have seen a star and uh
[1:10:58] we've come to worship him because you
[1:11:00] know we've come to worship the king do
[1:11:01] you know where he is and
[1:11:02] it's you know whatever their
[1:11:04] conversation was what another king
[1:11:06] you know so he felt his kingdom was
[1:11:08] threatened because he couldn't have
[1:11:09] another king around because he wanted to
[1:11:11] be the only one that
[1:11:12] that really mattered so he he caused
[1:11:14] havoc and fear
[1:11:15] among king herod anyways
[1:11:18] while still being in the womb of a woman
[1:11:21] amen
[1:11:22] just the ways of god of how it confounds
[1:11:24] oh my
[1:11:26] now see there was a time just at the
[1:11:28] mention of his name john the baptist
[1:11:30] left in his mother's womb and she was
[1:11:31] filled with the holy ghost see there was
[1:11:33] none like him
[1:11:34] even while he was in the womb before
[1:11:36] even at birth there was none like him
[1:11:39] the virgin birth puzzled people and
[1:11:40] caused concern because it appeared that
[1:11:42] a woman became pregnant out of wedlock
[1:11:44] which is a bad thing
[1:11:46] back in those days it's still a bad
[1:11:48] thing
[1:11:49] but it's just more accepted because it's
[1:11:51] more prevalent in this day you know it's
[1:11:54] it's more widely acceptable
[1:11:56] they want that okay well just don't
[1:11:58] abort it you know
[1:11:59] and which i which i agree don't abort
[1:12:00] the baby you know
[1:12:02] you know you made the mistake uh and and
[1:12:05] you know i've got a lot of respect for
[1:12:07] women
[1:12:07] that uh that might be single or uh
[1:12:11] i i think of my sister-in-law eileen
[1:12:14] and i think of my mom just
[1:12:18] uh of course eileen was with andy uh
[1:12:22] at that time also but kind of going uh
[1:12:25] situations happen you know and my mom
[1:12:28] she
[1:12:28] uh she struggled i got to see what what
[1:12:31] hard work
[1:12:32] uh was you know a a woman that
[1:12:36] was just labor for children no matter
[1:12:38] the sacrifices she had to make she had
[1:12:40] to make sure that we were fed
[1:12:42] and uh you know and i just have a lot of
[1:12:44] respect for
[1:12:45] a woman that would uh support her family
[1:12:48] in the absence of of
[1:12:50] a husband or uh somebody there to help
[1:12:52] her you know
[1:12:53] uh you know i just think his sister
[1:12:56] eileen that
[1:12:57] she didn't let that situation hold her
[1:12:59] down she went and she finished
[1:13:01] high school she graduated so i know it's
[1:13:03] possible
[1:13:04] i know it's a very possible thing she
[1:13:05] was just she's just a determined sister
[1:13:09] she she went on and graduated high
[1:13:11] school she went to college
[1:13:12] and she put herself through college you
[1:13:14] know with with annie's help of course
[1:13:16] but they didn't let that situation uh
[1:13:19] get them down
[1:13:20] and uh that they had sister ashley at an
[1:13:23] early age
[1:13:24] but she went on she went through college
[1:13:26] and she she got through
[1:13:27] you know and i have a lot of respect not
[1:13:29] just for a woman but for a man that
[1:13:30] would do the same thing just a person
[1:13:32] that wouldn't let their situation
[1:13:34] bring them down to use as an excuse well
[1:13:36] i can't go do this
[1:13:37] because of this situation yes you can do
[1:13:40] this if you put your mind to it
[1:13:42] and you put forth the effort and the
[1:13:44] problem is people don't want to put
[1:13:45] forth the effort to get the reward
[1:13:47] they just want things handed to them
[1:13:49] hand in foot whatever it might be
[1:13:51] there are things available for people
[1:13:53] now it's just a matter of going out and
[1:13:55] get it
[1:13:55] getting it we have to get our our eyes
[1:13:57] off of our tv
[1:13:58] our eyes off of our phone or whatever it
[1:14:00] might be and get out there and actually
[1:14:02] do
[1:14:02] something you have to get out there and
[1:14:05] make things happen
[1:14:06] pretty much yo
[1:14:07] [Music]
[1:14:12] so people were uh people were confounded
[1:14:15] while he was in the womb
[1:14:17] now we learned that he was uh he
[1:14:19] confounded the wise as a boy
[1:14:21] as well in luke chapter 2 and verse 46
[1:14:24] it says and it came to pass that after
[1:14:26] three days they found him in the temple
[1:14:28] sitting in the midst of the doctors both
[1:14:30] hearing them and
[1:14:31] asking them questions so it wasn't just
[1:14:34] he wasn't stealing the show all the time
[1:14:36] you know he was
[1:14:36] he was humble enough to listen to what
[1:14:38] they had to say and then he said some
[1:14:40] things
[1:14:40] and and that's what a dialogue is it
[1:14:43] wasn't a monologue where he took the
[1:14:44] whole thing and where he was talking all
[1:14:46] the time
[1:14:46] and so that's pretty much what happens
[1:14:48] in a lot of our prayer lives is it
[1:14:50] becomes a monologue
[1:14:51] you know we just tell god all of our
[1:14:53] problems what was me and i got this
[1:14:54] problem and i got that problem but they
[1:14:56] don't spend any time listening what he
[1:14:58] has to say
[1:15:01] and we wonder why we can't get anything
[1:15:03] [Music]
[1:15:08] amen
[1:15:10] and verse 47 it says and all that heard
[1:15:13] him were astonished at his understanding
[1:15:15] and answers
[1:15:16] so he astonished even the wise at that
[1:15:18] day because they they couldn't fathom
[1:15:19] how much wisdom
[1:15:20] a young boy would have uh that they were
[1:15:23] even learning from him
[1:15:27] and just like mo excuse me i'm mixing up
[1:15:30] my letters here
[1:15:31] i'm tired i've appreciated that this
[1:15:35] morning for a very long time
[1:15:37] so i mean i was somewhat like it but
[1:15:41] i thought somebody was going to have to
[1:15:42] pick me up off the floor after a while
[1:15:43] because i was getting kind of
[1:15:44] well i don't know i'm going to try to
[1:15:47] take it easy tonight
[1:15:49] but we don't know what the lord's going
[1:15:50] to do either but like job mary tried
[1:15:53] the correction and uh and in turn
[1:15:56] because we know uh when they started
[1:15:58] leaving
[1:15:59] uh they finally realized hey where's
[1:16:01] jesus and they went and
[1:16:03] went back and and uh mary kind of
[1:16:05] scolded him
[1:16:06] you know where you're supposed to be
[1:16:07] with your mother and father and uh
[1:16:09] and jesus even rebuked her
[1:16:13] saying that i must be about my father's
[1:16:15] business you know
[1:16:16] i'm here taking care of what the father
[1:16:18] wants me to do
[1:16:20] uh i know what a lot of us would do to
[1:16:22] our child if they were to speak to us
[1:16:24] something like that
[1:16:27] but she kind of had she kind of knew
[1:16:28] what kind of child she had i think
[1:16:31] so because gabriel told her that's right
[1:16:33] so
[1:16:34] never a man spake like this man the man
[1:16:37] jesus so
[1:16:38] like i said early on it might seem like
[1:16:40] we're kind of skipping around but
[1:16:42] uh
[1:16:46] just gonna hit some highlights of his
[1:16:47] life and stuff
[1:16:49] so never a man spake like this man
[1:16:52] like the man jesus some he united
[1:16:55] and some he divided is that right
[1:16:58] so when he spoke truth it caused
[1:17:01] division
[1:17:03] amen john chapter 7 and verse 43
[1:17:07] says so there was a division among the
[1:17:09] people because of him
[1:17:12] and some of them would have taken him
[1:17:13] but no man laid hands on him
[1:17:17] then came the officers to the chief
[1:17:19] priests and the pharisees and they said
[1:17:20] unto them
[1:17:22] why have you not brought them the
[1:17:23] officers answered well never a man spake
[1:17:25] like this man
[1:17:26] we didn't know what to do we didn't know
[1:17:29] how
[1:17:29] you know we didn't know how to handle
[1:17:31] that situation you know just the way
[1:17:33] that he spoke we were just
[1:17:34] wow we were in awe so what were we
[1:17:37] supposed to do
[1:17:38] you know he wasn't he wasn't causing any
[1:17:41] violence
[1:17:42] you know he spoke peacefully
[1:17:45] verse 47 says then answer them the
[1:17:47] pharisees
[1:17:48] are you also deceived have any other
[1:17:51] have any of the rulers of the affairs or
[1:17:53] of the pharisees believed on him
[1:17:56] they were so worried about losing
[1:17:58] members uh
[1:17:59] that they were so
[1:18:03] that they were so offended by jesus
[1:18:05] preaching truth and these other men
[1:18:06] preaching truth that they
[1:18:07] they couldn't have that because that
[1:18:09] would spoil all the lies that they've
[1:18:10] been
[1:18:11] telling over the years you know so
[1:18:16] their lives were being found out before
[1:18:18] them so they wanted to silence him as
[1:18:20] much as they could so he caused division
[1:18:23] because when he spoke truth it caused
[1:18:26] people to separate as as we said that
[1:18:29] the pharisees didn't like it because
[1:18:31] uh well they're going to cause an uproar
[1:18:34] they're they're going to
[1:18:35] every it was going to ruin their meal
[1:18:36] ticket pretty much that's that's pretty
[1:18:38] much what it was going to do it was
[1:18:39] tearing them down
[1:18:42] see people are still believing that the
[1:18:44] believing in the devil more than they
[1:18:46] are god
[1:18:47] people say that they'll worship god in
[1:18:49] their own way
[1:18:51] i remember when i was younger i would
[1:18:53] have conversations and
[1:18:54] uh you know discussions that
[1:18:58] uh people would say uh god isn't male
[1:19:02] or god's not a man or god's not male he
[1:19:04] could be female he could be
[1:19:06] uh we can call a mother
[1:19:09] father we he he's all everything so
[1:19:13] uh
[1:19:17] but it doesn't it it doesn't matter
[1:19:20] others might say that i don't want to go
[1:19:22] to church because it's too
[1:19:24] churchy
[1:19:28] i don't like how people get to carry it
[1:19:30] on or
[1:19:33] well they just don't know god at that
[1:19:35] church and i'm not going to attend that
[1:19:36] church because they they just can't
[1:19:38] they don't sing the songs that that i
[1:19:40] like and you know
[1:19:43] i can't get with these christians
[1:19:44] because they're just so boring or
[1:19:47] whatever you ever hear something like
[1:19:48] that
[1:19:48] i've heard that several times but like i
[1:19:52] said this morning remember you can't
[1:19:53] believe the devil's lie
[1:19:54] until you unless you first disbelieve
[1:19:56] god's word is that right
[1:19:58] but there's just no one like him uh that
[1:20:00] would say
[1:20:01] i am the way the truth or the in the
[1:20:03] life
[1:20:05] and for it to be true because there are
[1:20:07] people that that probably said that
[1:20:09] they try to make that uh they try to
[1:20:11] proclaim that they are something because
[1:20:13] we know in the scripture that
[1:20:14] uh that there were many false christs
[1:20:17] there weren't many
[1:20:18] false jesuses but there were false
[1:20:20] christs
[1:20:21] which jesus his name isn't the only name
[1:20:24] uh jesus uh i'm sure there are other
[1:20:28] people
[1:20:28] called jesus i think there was another
[1:20:30] one in the bible
[1:20:31] but it wasn't jesus the christ that we
[1:20:33] know of uh
[1:20:36] so it wasn't so much in into that name
[1:20:38] but
[1:20:39] people made so many proclamations out
[1:20:41] there that i'm
[1:20:42] i'm the messiah so that's why there were
[1:20:45] so many cautions in
[1:20:46] in the in the new testament that we're
[1:20:47] cautious of about the antichrist because
[1:20:50] there were so many false christs that
[1:20:51] came before jesus
[1:20:53] and if we think we have it now there
[1:20:55] were even there was just as much
[1:20:56] before jesus came amen so
[1:21:00] there was none there was no one like him
[1:21:02] when he proclaimed that i am the way the
[1:21:03] truth and the life
[1:21:04] and for it to be true there was none
[1:21:06] like him when he said
[1:21:08] i am the i am that bread i am the bread
[1:21:10] of life there was no one like him when
[1:21:12] he said lazarus come forth there was no
[1:21:14] other voice that they were that lazarus
[1:21:16] was going to listen to amen
[1:21:17] but when he said because and we were
[1:21:20] taught by brother branham that
[1:21:21] jesus was man and he was a man when he
[1:21:25] shed tears for lazarus but he was god
[1:21:27] when he said lazarus come forth amen
[1:21:29] so there was no one like him when he
[1:21:32] said lazarus come forth who else was
[1:21:33] able to raise somebody else from the
[1:21:35] dead
[1:21:36] [Laughter]
[1:21:38] his wisdom continued to baffle the wise
[1:21:40] he caused a rocket saying that the
[1:21:42] temple would be torn down and in three
[1:21:43] days he would build the temples all
[1:21:45] right
[1:21:45] in john chapter 2 and verse 19 it says
[1:21:48] jesus answered and sent
[1:21:50] to them destroy this temple and in three
[1:21:52] days i will rise it up of course they
[1:21:53] didn't know what
[1:21:54] what he was talking about then said the
[1:21:56] jews 46 years was his temple in building
[1:21:59] and without reared up in three days but
[1:22:01] he spanked at the temple of his body is
[1:22:03] that right
[1:22:04] and as a gentle man his righteous
[1:22:06] indignation rose up and with the money
[1:22:08] chamber changers for defiling his
[1:22:10] father's house of prayer worship
[1:22:12] you know i hear people say that it
[1:22:13] wasn't that wasn't love when he
[1:22:15] went and picked up the whip and he
[1:22:17] started whipping them money changers
[1:22:18] uh that that wasn't love that was a
[1:22:21] temper he just lost his temper well i
[1:22:23] say that
[1:22:24] that's not it it was the zeodine house
[1:22:26] had eaten me up amen
[1:22:28] it was the zeal that he had for purity
[1:22:30] to be inside the church
[1:22:32] it had to be a pure thing that he wanted
[1:22:34] oh my goodness
[1:22:35] he didn't want to see it defiled so he
[1:22:37] rose up and he did something about it
[1:22:38] because nobody else
[1:22:39] even even the priest should have known
[1:22:41] that that shouldn't be going on
[1:22:42] but they let it happen amen
[1:22:46] he calmed the sea and they asked well
[1:22:48] what manner of man is this
[1:22:49] that has power over the wind
[1:22:53] he speaks as one with authority mark
[1:22:54] chapter one and and twenty two it says
[1:22:57] and they were astonished at his doctrine
[1:22:58] for he taught them as one that had
[1:23:00] authority
[1:23:01] and not as the scribes the scribes
[1:23:03] taught
[1:23:04] but they didn't have any authority
[1:23:05] behind it so it was different when it
[1:23:07] came from jesus when he did the teaching
[1:23:09] there was authority that be
[1:23:10] that came behind and they said what kind
[1:23:12] of man is this that
[1:23:13] he speaks with one as a that has
[1:23:16] authority amen
[1:23:17] they tried to catch him in many traps
[1:23:19] and were taken back when he said
[1:23:21] render under caesar what is caesar's and
[1:23:23] unto god what is god's they were just
[1:23:24] they were just aghast they didn't know
[1:23:26] what to answer nobody else asked him
[1:23:27] anything after that
[1:23:30] because because they were trying to get
[1:23:32] him so round up but he wouldn't give in
[1:23:33] to their
[1:23:34] their uh their traps that they were
[1:23:36] trying to set for him
[1:23:37] he just said okay if you want to do this
[1:23:39] whose inscription is this on this coin
[1:23:41] okay this is yours this is what man has
[1:23:43] made surrender unto man what is man's
[1:23:45] but what is god's you give unto god
[1:23:49] he made that separation and he made it
[1:23:50] clear amen
[1:23:52] mark chapter 12 and verse 28 says and
[1:23:54] one of the scribes came
[1:23:56] and having heard them reasoning together
[1:23:58] now
[1:23:59] did you hear that they were reasoning
[1:24:01] together
[1:24:02] not shouting back and forth and having a
[1:24:04] screaming bat match that my doctrine is
[1:24:06] uh more right than your doctrine but
[1:24:08] they were reasoning together
[1:24:10] and perceiving that he had answered them
[1:24:12] well asked him
[1:24:13] which is the first commandment of all
[1:24:15] and jesus answered him
[1:24:16] the first of all the commandments is
[1:24:18] hero israel
[1:24:20] the lord our god is one lord
[1:24:26] and thou shalt love the lord thy god
[1:24:28] with all thy heart and with all
[1:24:30] thy soul and with all thy mind and with
[1:24:32] all thy strength
[1:24:34] this is the first commandment and the
[1:24:36] second is like namely this
[1:24:38] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:24:41] there is none
[1:24:41] other commandment greater than these
[1:24:46] and the scribe said unto him well master
[1:24:49] thou has said the truth
[1:24:50] for there is one god amen and there is
[1:24:54] none
[1:24:55] other but he oh my
[1:24:59] so this man this scribe is saying there
[1:25:01] is no other god but he
[1:25:02] there is no one else like him amen and
[1:25:05] to love him
[1:25:06] with all the heart and with all the
[1:25:08] understanding and with all the soul
[1:25:10] and with all the strength and to love
[1:25:12] his neighbor as himself
[1:25:14] is more than all whole burnt offerings
[1:25:17] and sacrifices it's more than all that
[1:25:20] you could do
[1:25:21] as a man any work that you could do but
[1:25:23] if you just give them your whole self
[1:25:26] if you could be that living sacrifice
[1:25:28] living unto others amen
[1:25:30] forgetting about yourself but giving on
[1:25:32] to others your focus is on someone else
[1:25:35] and the focus is taken off of you
[1:25:39] and when jesus saw that he answered
[1:25:41] discreetly he said unto him
[1:25:43] thou art not far from the kingdom of god
[1:25:45] oh my how i would like to hear that too
[1:25:48] amen and no man after after that durst
[1:25:51] or dared to ask him any question amen he
[1:25:54] could tell you what you were thinking
[1:25:55] see
[1:25:56] there was none like him because there
[1:25:58] were some people that could tell you
[1:25:59] what you were thinking but they were
[1:26:00] just mind readers but there was
[1:26:02] something different he had to give
[1:26:03] he had the discernment amen he could
[1:26:05] tell what you were thinking
[1:26:07] yes sir
[1:26:09] [Music]
[1:26:11] and we know brother brandon had that
[1:26:12] gift as well but it wasn't brother
[1:26:14] branham it was the spirit
[1:26:16] inside brother brandon was that right it
[1:26:18] was it was the gift
[1:26:20] it's not something that he learned and
[1:26:22] picked up from somewhere
[1:26:26] but in luke chapter 7 and verse 39 it
[1:26:28] says now when the pharisee
[1:26:30] which had bitten him saw it he spake
[1:26:32] within himself
[1:26:33] no he didn't within himself he didn't
[1:26:35] say it out loud saying
[1:26:37] this man if he were a prophet would have
[1:26:39] known who and what manner of woman this
[1:26:41] is that touches him
[1:26:42] for she is a sinner and jesus answering
[1:26:46] said unto him
[1:26:47] simon i have somewhat to say unto thee
[1:26:49] and he saith
[1:26:50] master say on and he went on to rebuke
[1:26:53] him for
[1:26:53] uh for not even acknowledging his
[1:26:55] presence he said thy
[1:26:57] the sins that she had they have forgiven
[1:26:59] her amen
[1:27:01] from the time that she came in she did
[1:27:03] not cease to to wash my feet and to kiss
[1:27:05] me and
[1:27:06] anoint me with oil but she did all these
[1:27:08] things but when i came in you just sat
[1:27:10] over in that corner with your friends
[1:27:11] and you didn't even acknowledge that i
[1:27:13] came in the house
[1:27:15] but this woman from the time that she
[1:27:17] came in she did nothing but honor me
[1:27:23] he healed without medicine and required
[1:27:25] no fees all right
[1:27:26] mark 2 and 11 he says i say unto thee
[1:27:29] arise and take up thy bed and go thy way
[1:27:31] into thine house
[1:27:32] and immediately he arose took up the bed
[1:27:35] and went forth
[1:27:36] before them all in so much that they
[1:27:39] were all amazed and glorified god saying
[1:27:42] we never saw it on this fashion there is
[1:27:45] none like him they never saw anything
[1:27:47] like that happen
[1:27:48] there was none like him ever in john 5
[1:27:51] and 7 it says the impotent man answered
[1:27:53] him sir
[1:27:54] i have no man when the water is troubled
[1:27:57] to put me into the pool
[1:27:59] but while i'm coming another person
[1:28:01] steppeth down before me
[1:28:02] brother sister you don't have to wait to
[1:28:04] get into the pool tonight because you
[1:28:06] have that direct access to him
[1:28:07] and it was just jesus that came down and
[1:28:09] said i have
[1:28:10] what you have need of amen you don't
[1:28:12] have to go step into that
[1:28:14] pool now he could have went to any
[1:28:15] person there but he chose that man
[1:28:18] it was something about that man that he
[1:28:20] chose to give it to amen
[1:28:24] and we think we know something
[1:28:27] you know this this man all he knew was
[1:28:29] that he had to get into that pool of
[1:28:31] bethesda amen that's all he knew to get
[1:28:33] healed
[1:28:33] he didn't know anything else he wasn't a
[1:28:35] real smart man he didn't know how to go
[1:28:37] about
[1:28:37] getting healed any other way there were
[1:28:39] no doctors that could help him because
[1:28:41] he would have gone to him or he couldn't
[1:28:42] afford one or the other
[1:28:44] but he just couldn't make it it wasn't
[1:28:46] in his knowledge he wasn't even
[1:28:48] thinking of the other man coming up to
[1:28:50] him even thinking saying oh you could be
[1:28:51] healed
[1:28:53] it just happened
[1:28:59] in verse 8 it says jesus jesus saith
[1:29:02] unto him
[1:29:03] rise take up thy bed and walk
[1:29:07] there was one that healed a young girl
[1:29:09] in her ears
[1:29:10] and all y'all know sister julia newmar
[1:29:13] we were sitting there i can't remember
[1:29:14] the brother's name
[1:29:15] i think it was paul he was a short
[1:29:17] little guy
[1:29:18] short little preacher and he was just
[1:29:20] preaching a message
[1:29:22] and at the end he was just praying he
[1:29:23] says i don't know why sister but i feel
[1:29:25] led to pray for your ears
[1:29:26] and after he started praying for her you
[1:29:28] could see her sitting up there just a
[1:29:30] giggling
[1:29:30] and why was she giggling because she
[1:29:32] could actually hear something without
[1:29:34] the hearing aid
[1:29:35] something take something had taken place
[1:29:37] there was someone
[1:29:38] there was somebody that healed me in my
[1:29:40] hips you know oh my
[1:29:42] there was one that healed me so many
[1:29:45] times now
[1:29:46] y'all know the story i think i told it
[1:29:48] the last time that i was here brother
[1:29:49] jesse had prayed for me
[1:29:51] and i was going through they were
[1:29:52] talking about that i needed some
[1:29:54] uh hip replacement because my my hip was
[1:29:56] degrading
[1:29:58] and now it was just wearing away and
[1:30:00] they said that there was nothing that
[1:30:01] they could do about it
[1:30:03] aside from a hip replacement you know
[1:30:06] here i am 44
[1:30:07] 45 years old whenever it was uh that it
[1:30:09] took place
[1:30:10] and you know that's too young for a hip
[1:30:11] replacement i couldn't go through that
[1:30:13] you know
[1:30:14] i didn't want that to happen but by the
[1:30:18] prayer of faith
[1:30:19] my hips were healed i remember uh
[1:30:21] getting a call from the woman
[1:30:23] we went over your uh your mri
[1:30:26] and uh we see what they what they were
[1:30:29] talking about
[1:30:30] but uh it's it's something changed
[1:30:33] something's different
[1:30:34] your body must have healed itself and
[1:30:36] all i could think of was the body of
[1:30:37] christ because the body of christ was
[1:30:39] praying for me amen
[1:30:40] and i just thank god so much for that
[1:30:42] there's none like him when you have
[1:30:44] need of healing he's there to heal you
[1:30:46] amen amen
[1:30:48] thank you lord and his home did it
[1:30:50] happen in an instant no it didn't
[1:30:52] i suffered for a little while it was a
[1:30:55] few months that i had to wait i can't
[1:30:56] remember about six months or something
[1:30:57] like that i had to wait
[1:30:59] and i remember there was a man in there
[1:31:00] a young man when i got that phone call
[1:31:03] and i said if you've never been preached
[1:31:04] to you're about to because i was ready
[1:31:06] to preach the salvation of christ amen
[1:31:10] about the healing of a soul amen
[1:31:13] but there is no one like him in his
[1:31:14] suffering is all right and the garden of
[1:31:16] gethsemane
[1:31:17] he he sweat drops or uh he sweat his
[1:31:20] drops of blood luke 22 and 44.
[1:31:22] it says uh and being in agony he
[1:31:24] probably i'm getting excited up there
[1:31:27] that's why i'm getting a little dancy up
[1:31:29] here so and being in agony
[1:31:32] uh he prayed more earnestly and his
[1:31:33] sweat was as as it were
[1:31:35] great drops of blood falling down to the
[1:31:37] ground how many of us
[1:31:38] have been an earnest that we even sweat
[1:31:40] drops of sweat amen
[1:31:42] not so much that uh as sweat as drops of
[1:31:44] blood
[1:31:45] but how many people just get so much in
[1:31:47] in a fervent prayer
[1:31:48] see the fervent prayer of a righteous
[1:31:50] man availeth much
[1:31:52] amen so if you're just just just
[1:31:54] passively asking lord
[1:31:55] i need you to help me if you could do
[1:31:57] that today thank you and just walk away
[1:31:58] and continue on doing what you're doing
[1:32:00] but uh the fervent prayer of a righteous
[1:32:03] man availeth much amen
[1:32:05] who am i there's just something that
[1:32:08] stirs me in my soul knowing how much
[1:32:10] how much god has answered prayer in my
[1:32:12] life amen
[1:32:16] but you know why he was struggling so
[1:32:17] hard in the garden of gethsemane
[1:32:19] because he was going to go to a cross
[1:32:21] for you and me is that right he was
[1:32:22] going to take care of something for
[1:32:24] somebody else
[1:32:25] his focus wasn't on him so much but he
[1:32:27] was just i don't want to go through with
[1:32:28] this but i know there's something better
[1:32:30] at the end amen
[1:32:31] i have to go through this amen now see
[1:32:35] he was wounded for our transgressions
[1:32:37] isaiah 53 and 5 he says but he was
[1:32:40] wounded
[1:32:40] for our transgressions he was bruised
[1:32:43] for our iniquities and the chastisement
[1:32:45] of our peace was upon him
[1:32:46] and with his stripes we are healed
[1:32:50] amen is that right and i believe it i'm
[1:32:52] a testament to that and any other person
[1:32:54] in here that's been healed is a
[1:32:55] testament that he's still a healer in
[1:32:57] this day
[1:32:58] i don't care if they try to say signs of
[1:33:00] miracles or past i've seen it
[1:33:01] several times just in my life that oh my
[1:33:04] goodness
[1:33:05] not even just a start on other people
[1:33:07] there were books books upon books upon
[1:33:09] books
[1:33:10] about divine healing where directors
[1:33:12] couldn't even
[1:33:13] touch the ailment and it was just divine
[1:33:16] intervention where god had healed them
[1:33:17] amen
[1:33:18] who am i god will not leave himself
[1:33:22] without a witness is that right
[1:33:23] oh my see there is none like him in
[1:33:26] death or burial
[1:33:27] people railed on him you know if you
[1:33:29] were the cr if you were the christ
[1:33:31] then you save yourself not knowing that
[1:33:33] they couldn't
[1:33:34] give him a better compliment because he
[1:33:36] stayed there for us he endured the
[1:33:38] torture
[1:33:38] the pain the humiliation for you and me
[1:33:41] they couldn't give him a better
[1:33:42] compliment if you're christ like
[1:33:44] they come down off that cross but he had
[1:33:46] to stay there for you and me
[1:33:49] they just testified to what he was
[1:33:51] exactly doing is that right
[1:33:53] oh my because you could save yourself
[1:33:55] they were trying to and that's the same
[1:33:57] thing that the devil
[1:33:58] tries to do as is you could save
[1:33:59] yourself you could save yourself this
[1:34:01] humiliation if you just blame it on
[1:34:03] somebody else
[1:34:04] oh my oh now i'm getting into somebody
[1:34:07] but that's we've got to be able to
[1:34:09] accept responsibility for our own
[1:34:11] actions is that right
[1:34:12] you know you do the crime you do the
[1:34:14] time you just better be expecting that
[1:34:16] spanking
[1:34:16] when it comes amen right you because you
[1:34:19] reap what you sow
[1:34:21] you're not going to escape it amen
[1:34:22] that's right who am i
[1:34:25] no one died like him he even had a
[1:34:27] borrowed tomb
[1:34:28] it was temporary you know when you
[1:34:31] borrow something
[1:34:32] you usually plan to return it is that
[1:34:34] right but he didn't plan on staying very
[1:34:36] long he was going to give it back
[1:34:38] he wasn't he didn't plan on staying in
[1:34:39] that tomb oh my
[1:34:42] matthew 27 and 58 he says he went to
[1:34:45] pilate uh talking about joseph
[1:34:47] uh he went to pilate and begged the body
[1:34:49] of jesus then pilate commanded the body
[1:34:51] to be delivered
[1:34:52] and when joseph had taken the body he
[1:34:54] wrapped it in a clean linen cloth
[1:34:55] and laid it in his own new tomb
[1:35:01] did you catch that and then and laid it
[1:35:04] in his own
[1:35:05] new tomb which he had hewn out of the
[1:35:07] rock and he rolled a great stone to the
[1:35:09] door of the sepulcher and departed
[1:35:11] and verse 53 it says and he took it down
[1:35:14] and wrapped it in linen and laid it laid
[1:35:17] it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone
[1:35:19] where uh wherein never a man laid
[1:35:23] was before it was laid i feel like i
[1:35:25] jumped scripture i did i went to a
[1:35:27] different
[1:35:28] book sorry about that luke 23 and 53 it
[1:35:30] says and he took it down
[1:35:31] wrapped it in linen and laid it in the
[1:35:33] sepulchre that was hewn and stone this
[1:35:35] was after the crucifixion wherein never
[1:35:36] man
[1:35:37] was before laid you know i just had a
[1:35:40] thought in there
[1:35:41] before i came out i was kind of
[1:35:42] reviewing uh going over the notes here
[1:35:46] now if you notice in matthew uh 27 and
[1:35:49] 60 it says and he laid it in his own new
[1:35:52] tomb
[1:35:52] now see if there were there if there
[1:35:54] were other people other
[1:35:56] bones in that gr in that tomb when jesus
[1:35:58] rose
[1:35:59] guess what those other bones would have
[1:36:00] had to raise with them but it was not
[1:36:02] yet time for a resurrection time
[1:36:04] amen
[1:36:07] the one resurrection had already taken
[1:36:09] past but oh my
[1:36:11] or taken his course
[1:36:14] he was so holy that he didn't lie in the
[1:36:16] defile tomb it was a new tomb it was a
[1:36:18] bar to him like i said he was going to
[1:36:20] return it
[1:36:21] amen there was no one like him in his
[1:36:24] death
[1:36:25] he forgave the thief on the cross it
[1:36:27] could have been that he left his body
[1:36:29] uh left his body on the cross for a
[1:36:31] minute and escorted that forgiven sinner
[1:36:32] to the gates of paradise is that right
[1:36:35] uh matthew 27 and 51 it says and behold
[1:36:39] the veil of the temple was rent and
[1:36:41] twain from from the top to the bottom
[1:36:44] and the earth did quake and the rocks
[1:36:46] rent and the graves were open and many
[1:36:47] bodies of the saints which slept the
[1:36:49] rose
[1:36:50] and came out of the graves after his
[1:36:52] resurrection
[1:36:54] and went into the holy city and appeared
[1:36:56] unto many amen

[1:37:14] that right

[1:37:19] because i think i said that
[1:37:20] the resurrection already happened no it
[1:37:22] was after his resurrection that the
[1:37:23] saints arose
[1:37:24] so i i apologize for saying that i just

[1:37:57] who is this king of glory that's what
[1:37:59] the bible said
[1:38:00] in the old testament saints said the
[1:38:02] lord of hosts mighty in battle
[1:38:04] here he comes the king with his
[1:38:05] delegates the conqueror
[1:38:08] although he is a mighty conqueror since
[1:38:10] he rent the veil in two
[1:38:13] the angel pressed the gates the pearly
[1:38:15] gates swing
[1:38:16] swung open when he pressed the button uh
[1:38:19] down through the city of jerusalem come
[1:38:21] comes jesus the conqueror
[1:38:23] with all the old testament saints that
[1:38:25] lived back there believing that he would
[1:38:26] he would come sometime excuse me
[1:38:30] i could see him marching as angelic
[1:38:33] bands beating and playing and the angels
[1:38:35] sing hosanna
[1:38:36] here come the old testament saints and
[1:38:38] jesus are walking through the streets
[1:38:40] right up in front of the father he said
[1:38:42] father these are those that died in good
[1:38:44] faith amen
[1:38:45] he says well done my son climb up here
[1:38:47] on my throne and sit down on my right
[1:38:49] hand
[1:38:50] till i make every enemy your footstool
[1:38:52] for one of these days i'm going down
[1:38:54] to bingham binghamton new york or
[1:38:58] akron ohio wherever it might be
[1:39:00] hallelujah i'm going to send you back
[1:39:02] again to get everyone that dies
[1:39:03] in faith amen there he is the great
[1:39:06] mighty conqueror sitting
[1:39:08] at the right hand of the majesty of god
[1:39:10] tonight in his presence now see there is
[1:39:12] none
[1:39:12] like him amen there is only one making
[1:39:16] intersection
[1:39:17] on anybody here that will dare to take
[1:39:19] him by faith
[1:39:21] and god will send the holy ghost down to
[1:39:23] seal you
[1:39:24] into the kingdom of god amen jesus has
[1:39:27] come
[1:39:29] musicians come
[1:39:35] there was no one like him in his
[1:39:36] resurrection he rose up with the power
[1:39:38] and he took the sting of death in the
[1:39:40] keys of hell is that right
[1:39:41] there is no one like him in his
[1:39:43] ascension john 3 and 13 it says and
[1:39:45] no man hath ascended up to heaven but he
[1:39:48] that came down from heaven
[1:39:50] even the son of man which is in heaven
[1:39:53] ephesians
[1:39:54] 4 and 8 through 10 it says wherefore he
[1:39:56] saith
[1:39:57] when he ascended up on high he led
[1:39:59] captivity
[1:40:00] captive and gave gifts unto men now he
[1:40:03] that it
[1:40:04] that now that he has ascended what is it
[1:40:06] but
[1:40:07] that he also descended first into the
[1:40:09] lower parts of the earth to take away
[1:40:11] the keys of the devils
[1:40:12] to take away the sting of death hell in
[1:40:14] the grave amen
[1:40:15] he that descended is the same also that
[1:40:17] ascended up far above
[1:40:19] all heavens that he might fill all
[1:40:22] things now see there was none like him
[1:40:24] in an ascension they might say that
[1:40:25] there
[1:40:26] there were other resurrections or
[1:40:27] whatever but there was none like jesus
[1:40:29] amen
[1:40:30] no one thought no one was born like him
[1:40:32] no one died like him no one spake like
[1:40:34] him
[1:40:35] there's just none like him there are
[1:40:38] many that resemble him
[1:40:40] that did mighty works but they are not
[1:40:42] fully him is that right
[1:40:43] we talk about brother branham he had the
[1:40:45] gifts of healing he had the gifts of
[1:40:47] discernment
[1:40:47] but he was not fully god amen he was
[1:40:50] only partial god
[1:40:52] oh my oh
[1:40:59] some may display some of the attributes
[1:41:01] but they will never be the fullness of
[1:41:03] god
[1:41:04] we are just man amen joseph was close
[1:41:07] whereas he typed he he was a type of
[1:41:10] jesus christ he was close to it
[1:41:11] but he wasn't him moses was close as
[1:41:14] being god as we talked about this
[1:41:15] morning that god set him in the position
[1:41:17] of
[1:41:17] of being god and aaron as his prophet
[1:41:20] but
[1:41:20] god uh but he was still not god he was
[1:41:24] still
[1:41:25] man he still had humanity joshua was
[1:41:27] kind of close being a type of the holy
[1:41:29] spirit
[1:41:29] but still he was not fully god amen but
[1:41:33] each of them is only one
[1:41:34] attribute where jesus christ was the
[1:41:36] fullness of the godhead
[1:41:38] jesus said there were many false christs
[1:41:40] before him and we know that there are
[1:41:41] many that follow after him
[1:41:43] there are so many counterfeits it could
[1:41:45] just about make you go crazy is that
[1:41:47] right
[1:41:47] he has a name that's above every name
[1:41:50] for where two or three are gathered in
[1:41:51] my name
[1:41:52] there i am in the midst of him see there
[1:41:54] is none like him that when you call upon
[1:41:56] him
[1:41:57] there he is he said be ye holy
[1:42:01] for i am holy when you give yourself
[1:42:03] unto him you get into his presence
[1:42:05] you become holy as he is holy but you
[1:42:07] are still not fully god amen
[1:42:09] we baptize in his name we don't baptize
[1:42:12] in the name
[1:42:13] the name of the father and son and the
[1:42:14] holy ghost we we do
[1:42:16] but it's all it's summed up in one name
[1:42:18] the name jesus christ amen
[1:42:20] there is none like him people tried to
[1:42:22] baptize in other men's names but it
[1:42:24] didn't work
[1:42:25] and paul said i thank god that i didn't
[1:42:27] baptize a one of you
[1:42:28] because you were going to try to say
[1:42:30] that i did something you were putting
[1:42:32] too much focus on me
[1:42:34] oh my if i
[1:42:38] thought i was i was going to try to take
[1:42:40] it easy
[1:42:42] oh my ephesians 4 and 3 says
[1:42:45] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[1:42:47] spirit in the bond of peace
[1:42:49] there was one body and one spirit even
[1:42:52] as you are called in one
[1:42:53] hope of your calling one lord one
[1:42:56] faith one baptism one god and father of
[1:43:00] all who is above all
[1:43:01] and through all and in you oh amen
[1:43:05] one lord one faith and one baptism
[1:43:10] you mean there's one baptism well what
[1:43:12] about matthew 28 19 and acts 2 38 that
[1:43:15] sounds like two baptisms
[1:43:17] nope the one sums up the other they
[1:43:18] become one amen because
[1:43:20] in the name of jesus christ is in the
[1:43:22] name of the father and the son and the
[1:43:23] holy ghost
[1:43:24] amen oh my who
[1:43:28] a greater than solomon is here greater
[1:43:30] than all is here is that right
[1:43:32] he's the one who makes our hearts burn
[1:43:34] within us he's the only one who can save
[1:43:36] us
[1:43:37] he's the only one who healeth all of our
[1:43:39] diseases
[1:43:40] he's the one who calms the storms of
[1:43:42] life when it seems to be raging out of
[1:43:43] control is that right
[1:43:45] he's the one who sets the kept us free
[1:43:47] he's the one who parted the red sea
[1:43:49] leaving behind the enemies amen they try
[1:43:51] to follow closely on your heels
[1:43:53] he's the one who parts out waters amen
[1:43:56] praise the lord you don't have to ask
[1:43:58] anyone's permission to come to him
[1:44:00] it's not dependent upon your shaking on
[1:44:02] same with someone's hand
[1:44:03] or signing a membership book a man was
[1:44:05] healed and the leaders went to his
[1:44:07] parents to interrogate them
[1:44:08] because they weren't satisfied with his
[1:44:10] answers amen
[1:44:11] his parents responded ask him he's of
[1:44:13] age because they were afraid of being
[1:44:15] tossed out of the church is that right
[1:44:17] it was his own experience that he that
[1:44:19] he had to go through
[1:44:20] it was his experience not his parents
[1:44:23] who oh my
[1:44:24] it's not in reciting the apostles creed
[1:44:26] or the lord's prayer
[1:44:27] our uh our pastor the other day he was
[1:44:30] just talking about coming as you are
[1:44:32] which is something that you have to do
[1:44:33] don't try to be like somebody else
[1:44:35] come as you are you got folks and
[1:44:37] failures you did something you might set
[1:44:39] out of church
[1:44:39] but come as you are and bring it to god
[1:44:42] amen
[1:44:44] god is a forgiven forgiver of sins is
[1:44:47] that right
[1:44:48] blessed is the man whose sins and
[1:44:50] iniquities are forgiven hallelujah
[1:44:52] there's only one that could do that
[1:44:54] there's none like him amen
[1:44:57] he's the god that i serve he's constant
[1:44:59] he's the same yesterday and today and
[1:45:01] forever what he was in the old testament
[1:45:03] didn't be in the new testament is that
[1:45:04] right
[1:45:05] so the one time they'd uh so we we read
[1:45:08] the story of what i've talked about this
[1:45:09] morning i think about the
[1:45:10] uh feeding the multitude the the 5000
[1:45:13] and the 4000 with with loads of fish or
[1:45:15] loaves of bread and the fish there was a
[1:45:17] time that they fed 100 men
[1:45:19] back there and uh when they were making
[1:45:20] the pot somebody went out and grabbed
[1:45:22] the herbs they didn't know what kind of
[1:45:23] herb it was they didn't realize it but
[1:45:25] it was poison in the pot
[1:45:26] and who did they call upon they called
[1:45:28] upon elisha and they said that there's
[1:45:30] poison in the pot
[1:45:31] and what happened he went and got some
[1:45:32] meal he went and got some bread the
[1:45:34] bread of life would put it in that soup
[1:45:36] is that right
[1:45:37] oh my god and he fed the multitude of a
[1:45:40] hundred men that day
[1:45:41] he's the same today yesterday and
[1:45:43] forever is that right
[1:45:49] hallelujah hallelujah you better sing
[1:45:52] something
[1:45:54] let's sing that song uh uh one of my
[1:45:57] favorites no

[1:46:01] the lowly jesus is that right
[1:46:03] there is none like him you need a
[1:46:05] comforter he could comfort like no other
[1:46:07] person could comfort amen you try to go
[1:46:10] try to comfort a friend

[1:46:15] yes stay to your feet
[1:46:16] you try to comfort them you can try your
[1:46:19] best
[1:46:20] but when they call upon the name of the
[1:46:21] lord jesus there is no comforter
[1:46:23] like that comforter amen there's just no
[1:46:26] one like this
[1:46:26] there's no friend that's closer
[1:46:32] he is my friend he is my king and i'm so
[1:46:34] glad that he stands by himself
[1:46:38] and he said i will not share my glory
[1:46:40] with another amen
[1:46:41] and i love that song that we were
