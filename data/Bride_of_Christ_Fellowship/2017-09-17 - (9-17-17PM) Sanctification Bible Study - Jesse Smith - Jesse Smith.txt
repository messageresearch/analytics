[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] lately studies with young children I don't only gulfside biostudies to thank the desolate mother been appreciate it customized it I want to look a little more at sanctification so the scriptures here tonight we've been looking at the statue of urban man so look at a different few thoughts on the sanctification want to remind everybody that sanctification is purification of your heart and life expectations of your heart and life do girls want to be pure every day and now that you pure every day you come up front that I'm not going to do it's pictures on the street so purification of heart and life so let's look at a few scriptures we saw break the will of God to be sanctified 1st Thessalonians 4 so let's start with there let's review that process in chapter 4 it's God's perfect will I think we all want to be in God's perfect will don't be vs. Tony's 4 verse 3 verse 3 but before that we'll have another word of Prayer just over the power start the only father nor me thank you getting through this time Lord God I want to read your word he wanted to learn from thy word dear God and we want to grow in grace and knowledge of the lord thank you for these young Souls dear God or with numerous them being baptized last few months Lord God that's near dear God I just feel burning more doctors look at the Scriptures teach them these gospel truths nor death they're so dear to our hearts cool pretty blessed our time here Lord had and faithful at virtue and knowledge at each and every virtue you are God each and every characteristics in the lives of each other for your glory Jesus Christ every set 1st Thessalonians 4 verse Lori two and three [Music] that Malachi can read verses two and three verses 4 to 3 so it's God's will for you and I to be sanctified let's be purified of stealing hearts and lives I want to show that it comes by the word of so let's go to John chapter 13 so we all want to be sanctified right they want to be justified sanctified and filled the spirit but there's one way the sanctification comes and that's through the Word of God John 13 this is a story of Jesus having his light laughter washing the psychos feet Lydia you would like you to read a few verses for me read verses to fix for that their minds Jesus gets up and puts the towel on and he goes over to watch the feet and Peter said are you going to wash my feet the Peter on Jesus to wash you see he did once you just wash his feet because Peter felt so little we all feel right but then look at verse 7 Jesus answering said to him what I do that I know is not now but I'll shout no Hereafter [Music] so is sanctification a pretty important step for a believer you have to be washed and clean in your daily life it's extremely important if you don't get watched by Jesus we have no part with it but we want to part with Jesus so we've got to let him wash this and Jesus we know is the Word of God look at Simon Peters response once he hears that once he hears that if he doesn't get washed that's not a part of Jesus occasion II read verse 9 see what he says what you say what's he knew that in order to be a part in Jesus got to be washed where these pretty say yeah do all me wash all of me make sure every part of me is clean because I want to party Jesus that's why we pray everyday right read our Bibles with our family and try to learn the Word of God because we want Jesus with washing every part of us right then jesus said in verse 10 he that is washed needeth not safe to wash his feet but is clean every whit and ye are clean but not all for he knew he should betray him therefore he said we are not all clean so Judas was gonna betray Jesus for what what did Judas get returns me but not money so if somebody loves money too much but then approve they need to be cleaned out don't get they love money too much more than Jesus so Jesus said he's not clean because he still loves money so much he's got to get rid of his love for but you didn't so I want to start with that scripture show how we're sanctified through the word were purified through God's Word so if you think we should read our Bible everyday then just once a day or twice a day or a couple of times what do you think Compton should read our Bible ten times that'd be awesome as often as possible as often as possible and if you can't read your Bible then it's good to see right create the right atmosphere sing songs and to God not cursing and last thing the drive home but we at our house we like to start in the morning with the scripture and ended the day with Scripture as well then sing throughout the day listen to sermons okay I can play different pictures do I like to listen to them I wash dishes or work in the kitchen or something like that so the more we have of Jesus the more sanctify we can be I want to make sure I show everybody that that it's the word that washes us it's the word that sanctifies us so we've got to have a lot of time in the Bible don't be read the Word of God okay so the next one let's go to John 17 verse 14 already in John 13 so let's turn a few pages 17 14 so these scriptures Jesus is talking about the difference between the world so people that don't believe and the word I want you to see what he says here here's what's gonna happen if we get some priority cleaned out for God you're gonna happen so now you're even 14 so once we receive God's Word the world doesn't like us anymore let's turn around parents feed you raise your hand if you've lost friends because you've been a Christian and doing lost friends look at the hands my hands up to yeah when you start really getting washed and sanctified God's Word if you had worldly friends before some maybe not maybe simply wouldn't have to be friends but if you had worldly friends and you start getting washing God's Word they're not gonna like you very much longer why is that to them yeah yeah they don't like the words cooper signs laws yeah great job David yeah you know that they don't like the word right and how can two walk together except they be yeah we don't agree anymore like my friends we didn't agree with kind of music anymore so so much time with them because we didn't agree on they want to go to movies and I don't want to go to movies anymore I want to be sanctified right cleaned up forgot its purpose so they start not liking you really and Jesus even use the word hate and that's a really strong word but when it comes down to they really don't like the Word of God so Lydia you do 16 and 7 so let's say sanctified by the word ready sanctified by the word got a Bible hold up your Bible like this and say sanctified by the word ready sanctified by the word very good thank you said that so if we're justified we're baptized oh we're forgiven of our sins right to be sanctified we got to have a lot of teaching more of God you gotta really read the Bible understand or hear the Bible preach to us it's really important that's how we get sanctified Jesus says through the Word of God all right now I'm going to look at the next one let's go to another scripture let's go to acts 26 15 please X 26 15 26:15 this is about Jesus telling Paul they'd be sanctified by faith in Christ so acts 26 15 15 through 18 I'll start off with this one here and I said who art thou Lord and he said I am Jesus whom thou persecute us but rise and stand upon thy feet for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make the a minister to witness both of these things which now I see none of those things in which I will appear unto be delivering thee from the people and from the Gentiles of the good now I send thee verse 18 is going to look at to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith in me okay so that's what Jesus came to do he take you became and take you from the power of darkness and bring it to the power of light who knows what what was populate for the power of darkness before Jesus catered food he was he was hunting now Christians and saying you're going to jail no your hands the gummy handcuffs on you would put handcuffs jingle jingle jinkies that you're coming with me you're coming with me to jail that's what he did he was working for the power of the darkness right but then when Jesus came to him now he's gonna work for the kingdom of light right with the power of light and this was done he said he said by sanctified by faith that is from Chi you have that faith in the word that's creeps you have to believe with the preachers saying you have to believe what the Bible saying and you really gotta believe what your mom and dad say right really got to believe mom and dad if they're teaching the word every single day aren't they we come to church two days a week but your mom and dad they're with you every single day so that's one way to be sanctified by faith that's by obeying your parents so much every single day all right so I just want to show that we're sanctified by the word and then we're safe for safety 5 by the faith that's a Jesus that same thing gotta believe that works right it means something to us so you think we can all pay attention really well but we read I went home sobbing and then try to apply that to our lives with our brothers and sisters brothers and sisters yeah we can't we can't forget what I'm a dad read to us from the Bible we got to remember that we got to take that with us the rest of the day going all right raise the Lord let's take another one here let's go to 2nd Timothy 2:19 2nd Timothy 2:19 you actually read this scripture this morning service will read 20 and 21 22 I just saw that it's a very important scripture for sanctification [Music] [Music] do all the children want God to use [Music] thinking about how God might use our later on a right maybe with a mother doctor a nurse I may use her different ways of course worker you wouldn't be a horse person I know there's a fancy birthday equestrian you want to be a you want to be a chef that you need what's it gonna be a cooker girl can you be a cooker girl for Jesus absolutely what if there's so many at that restaurant that doesn't know Jesus could you shine the light of Jesus to them okay what do you want to be when you grew up dermatologist remind me what is that a good good money but you think there's people its science centers either speed what zoos that need to know about Christ absolutely there's always someone wherever got wherever God's given you desire to go and whatever work he's called you do there's only somebody that needs to hear about Christ there and if you don't go they won't hear so guess who's God God's gonna said he's gonna send you he's gonna use you because you give me a vessel but just you have to be sanctified to be able to be used by God to be sanctified so let's read that saying Timothy 2:19 case you read I do that are you you can keep turn their second Timothy 2:19 we read this in earlier nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that name of the name of Christ depart from iniquity okay so everybody's gotta leave their sins behind you look behind your shoulder wave and say my sins can you say that you're supposed to leave all iniquity behind which they said see you later sign our I don't want to see any more I will leave you all behind we're supposed to deep hard orally iniquity so no more bad words no more being upset to my sister no more being upset at my mom and dad we're supposed to leave that behind being heart from that and live a life of sanctification in case she's ready now Thank You Dart read verse 2029 Lydia do twenty [Music] twenty-one Scripture right there if a man purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor sanctified and meat for the Masters use prepared for every good work Wow so we must be sanctified in order for God to use us then you're prepared and ready to do some good work for the Lord everybody if you want God to use you got to be sanctified you got to be ready and cleaned out so he can use you alright breathe verse twenty-two Sara can you read verse twenty-two thank you appreciate that so you're supposed to run from youthful lusts and anybody think of youthful lusts things you might really want one year younger maybe not so much for your orders I know when when I was four younger I wanted a brand-new car I kind of got our family in debt at the beginning is that one of the brand new cars so bad but then we got burned out of definite that was one thing I just always wanted and I look back now I thought that was a really immature thing to do just wanting a new car why did it what would a new car feel like and sorry I should not have done that I kind of got that a mistake that I made but that's something I wanted as a youth I was a little older of course but at your age what might be a youthful lust that you might have to battle you may think I'm Duncan candy you definitely candy tester movies yeah definitely yes yeah could be friendships right one of you friends with other people could be fancy clothes right toy he's definitely had toys can't heat up those things those might be youthful things and then like we said and he eat any hard feelings like if you're really upset with somebody that could be something you battle as a young child as well but the Bible gave us the word flee what is flee me run run away from it should we run from all candy you think yes you think so yeah well we should try to avoid it right we don't have to exactly run from it but if we're having a hard time saying no to candy or maybe if we're stealing things then should we probably walk away from it really fast we wouldn't have to run would you want to walk away from it yeah we'd want to walk away you want to flee any youthful lusts so all those other examples are right to just trying to stay away from them as much as possible okay right here okay and then you're supposed to follow those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart so rub your chin who do you know in your life that follows God with a pure heart read you're an if you want to share s-sir who follows God your Nana very good let's give ourselves good answer yeah you want to live like Nana right you want to watch how does she live her life and you want to follow her you don't want to follow people that maybe say bad words right or that steal things or have each much candy you don't want to follow them right you want to follow the people of a pure heart RINO that's a pure heart be defiled who else those with another good example maybe I think I'm thinking of a teenage example you might know or a young adult example you might know they do from another church and human yeah Benjamin browning up from Sheffield I think he's a great example someone who calls on God out of a pure heart Lydia what do you think Marissa yeah Merson knew her she also goes to show through there so we should follow people that have a pure heart that's part of being sanctified you have to surround yourselves with the right people right and then you were more sanctified because you're gonna follow what they do so it's very important to remember that I want you to see that that's right in the scripture Bible says follow righteousness faith charity peace and then they call on God with a pure heart okay okay next one let me go next scripture here let's go to Romans 15:16 I want to share this Scripture Romans acts in Romans x12 is right okay okay go to chapter 5 chapter 15 16 I'm sorry Romans 1560 bringing this scripture so you can see that the spirit that's leading you to be sanctified is always going to be the holy spirit always going to be the Holy Ghost guiding you sanctifying you eventually he's going to fill you if you believe and obey all the commands of God he's gonna fill you but it's not a different sphere than the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost and justification sanctification and when he comes inside we read that think about what kind of feelings did you have when you decide to be baptized think about that think about what kind of feelings was the Holy Ghost giving you to be to encourage you to be baptized what did that feel like you could start with Esther the first one with an investor what kind of feelings were you having about wanting to be baptized love that's perfect beautiful love for God right love for Jesus so the Holy Ghost moved on Esther's heart want to be baptized and there's a feeling of love about Malachi and lydian Acacia they've been baptized what feelings did the Holy Ghost move upon your heart when you were to be baptized Acacia we felt very happy liddie people did yeah like this is the right way this is the right thing to do right you should do this need obey the word God yeah I remember that day yeah okay what did you feel excited praise the Lord I remember that even what did you feel what the Holy Ghost put on your heart very happy I remember that remember when you woke up you want to draw my iPad and I said okay and guess what she drew a picture up Rory's got baptized did you picture me baptizing her iPad and she didn't have to she'd not do that but it was on her mind and her heart so much that she drew a picture I thought she didn't draw like hearts or horses or something like that but that was on her heart so the Holy Spirit will put those thoughts on our heart it's the Holy Spirit a justification sanctification and the battle goes so Romans 15:16 Malachi can you read that for us thank you praise the Lord so that's what the scripture says we'd be except might be accessible being sanctified by the Holy Ghost so in other words the same voice that you're hearing now that might be saying this the same voice that saying that treat your sister the right way forgive your sister the same voice is that saying that is eventually gonna lead you and tell you the voice I'm gonna fill you with the Holy Spirit that's the voice that said love God right love Jesus be baptized it's gonna be the same spirit you just can be given you a new direction to go from being baptized now to be sanctified and then to be filled with the Holy Spirit is anybody ever near those voices I call you need to be filled you need to be sanctified as any of the children ever hear those voices you need to obey that wonderful to see this meant remember it's the same voice not a different voice the same voice or same conviction like Lydia said are the same love the same love that said you need to be baptized we become a Christian it's gonna be the same love that says you need to clean out your daily life habits and thoughts and whatever that entails right everything else all right I love that fantastic praise the Lord okay and here's where I think this is one of the most important scriptures on sanitation acts 5:32 let's go there acts 5:32 good acts that Romans good you got X 532 this is why obedience and sanctification this is why I got obey God every day you want the Holy Ghost good all we make mistakes every day but we can quickly repent and get right with God if you love the Holy Ghost 5:32 [Music] thank you God gives the Holy Ghost to them that do what what's that oh word obey let's say it again ready oh man say little louder oh hey hey God gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey Him and safe occasionally comes through the the Bible the word right so we have to obey the Bible it's gonna be that same voice the whole time saying obey this part submit to that believe that it's God's it's God's Way and then when you both show God you won't obey Him or sanctification then he'll give you the Holy Ghost which is Christ's life in you praising Allah and its power to be a witness it's power to be to have the testimony right that's what Jesus said it's the Holy Ghost in power so it's power to live a more dedicated life unto God alright next one let's go to Luke 24:49 and let's read that I want to show you an example with the disciples and sanctification Luke 24:49 24:49 yeah everybody hate Minh real quick Haven doesn't know how to read yet but she's been taking pretty good notes I thought people might like to see that on the scheduled program and there I was so thankful to see that she's trying to take notes I'm trying to learn pay attention just as a dad's heart real good Luke 24:49 so let's look at a good example of the disciples having to obey before they get the Holy Ghost we went through a lot last week overlap you all right try this one okay 24 Thank You occasion great read okay so Jesus said I'm going to send the promise of the Holy Ghost but he said you have to wait in Jerusalem until you're clothed with power from on high so Jerusalem so Malachi would Bethlehem worked they waited in Bethlehem without it worked no how about if they went to you know Gaul Lydia would that it worked no hmm how about Jericho Sarah would that have worked if they went to Jericho no they had to obey so in mom her dad tells you to do something you want to do exactly what they say you have to do exactly what they say that's part of being sanctified keeping all the Word of God now you know the story but let's go to Acts chapter 2 chapter 2 first one I'm sorry let's go to Acts chapter 1 verse 2 I'm sorry one remember they wanted the Holy Spirit they had to obey Jesus commands good thanks for help Acts chapter one will read verses two three four Liddy's one read verses 2 and 3 will have Sarah read verse 4 that city chapter one verse they saw Jesus forty days ok ok so what she did they go to Jerusalem they had to Jesus said you got to go to Jerusalem and then he said go there do what W go there and wait just go their way hurry up and get there and wait right there like we're in the car I heard somewhere that we have to wait to do what you wait to get food or wait to do whatever we need to do he said get to where you need to go and then wait and then we don't act chapter 2 that's where the Holy Spirit fell we remembers how many days they waited together you guys been there 10 days give Lydia some pause very chocolatey yeah wonderful ten days and we have we're spent ten days with our church together and they's in a row know about our family but picture picture being with a lot of families where 120 people for 10 days they're probably in and out maybe buying food maybe that some of the guys that were going to be deacons Navy later ended up decongestant maybe they're guys that acted as deacons 10 days they were together just waiting just waiting look at your watch pretend looking at your clock they're just waiting they kept looking well Jesus said just late Jesus said just waiting right so when you're seeking God and you've obeyed all God's commandments and maybe you don't feel like God has filled you right away what should you do you should keep waiting right even you keep waiting right if you've got everything you know how to do and you've kept all the commandments of God and you still haven't seen the promise of God come to pass we must wait who's the father of our faith that waited 25 years hey aren't you glad he didn't give up he waited 25 years and then got on this enterprise they only have to wait 10 days which is easier to wait 25 years or 10 days just 10 days but God kept his promise well God always keep his promise you always keep his promise so never forget his promise now I want to go a few more let's look at a few more examples of people that were sanctified but still not filled with the spirit and I got about 10 minutes okay good don't you see these sort of Acts chapter 8 verse 12 Acts chapter 8 verse 12 this is in Samaria Acts chapter 8 verse 12 acts 8 to 12 now if you know the story Philip went to Samaria he cast out demons he did miracles He healed the sick and a lot of people got saved a lot of people started believing in Jesus let's look at verse 12 let's see what happened but when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both men and women go down to verse 17 then Simon himself believed awesome and when he was baptized he continued with Philip and wondered beholding the miracles and signs which were done I want you two to stop a moment there Simon was a sorcerer which means he was working with demons and witchcraft and all kinds of things that we want to say we want to flee from that right we really want to run away from that that's definitely something we never want to run away from what he started believing and he got baptized but we're gonna see he wasn't saying defined yet because he had some pretty pretty offensive ideas still about God he thought you could by God's blessings with money can you buy God's blessings with money no no you can't buy especially the Holy Spirit God's own spirit you can't buy God's blessings with money and he still had that idea that shows his thoughts were really sanctified yet worthy but was he baptized yeah he's had a good thing that's a glorious thing that's a beautiful thing is to be baptized let's keep reading and see what happens verse 14 now one of the Apostles which were in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the Word of God they sent unto them Peter and John that's that Mallory who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost so these people had all been baptized like some of us up here and all of us in the back area all the adults been baptized right I've been baptized but in this case they were all baptized but they were gonna still get in prayer that they might receive the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost hadn't fallen yet because they weren't fully sanctified yet verse 16 thanks buddy 860 all right thank you hope everybody can see that people these wonderful people were baptized but the Holy Ghost had it fallen on them they had God's power fall on them and that's what they needed all right let's read verse 17 occasions when tried verse 17 then laid they all right then people started receiving the Holy Ghost people feel really bold when they receive the Holy Ghost you lads in the Bible they feel really bold learn what might we be bold about what might be bold about when you're playing outside not wearing a helmet when you ride a bike you might be bold about that I don't need to wear a helmet right I'd say that yeah some people might be like that right I don't have to wear a helmet we might be bold when we play what kind of games outside i dizzy yeah you might be very bold with high didn't seek tag yeah it might be bold do you go up and tap somebody like this then how you tag somebody when you play hide-and-seek no you're bold you're like come here I'm gonna chase you down to get you right you're bold aren't you like to play narnia what your kind battle scene like that good conquers Overeem us are you really timid what you do narnia battles are you really bold you're bold I know because we're doing sword fight sometimes are we sorry fight you're bold with it right you're Bowl that means you got a lot of emotion right a lot of a lot of direction you know what you want to do well when the Holy Ghost fell they were both for Jesus that's what we all need don't we both for Jesus and that's what they got when the Holy Ghost fell they received the Holy Ghost now let's look you back inside remember Simon the guy in sorcery he was baptized remember that that was good but let's look at verse 18 was the first eighteen now let's try to read down let anyone read eighteen oh you don't have and when Simon saw that through the laying on of the Apostles hands the Holy Ghost was given he offered them money saying give me also this power that on whom summer I lay my hands he may receive the Holy Ghost that's kind of that's in one way that's a good desire right he wants to see people filled with God but can you ever buy anything with money for God no we can't can't do that and this is actually a pretty serious thing because Peter rebukes them pretty hard it's a good verse 20 but Peter said to him thy money perish with thee so Peters been saying you're gonna perish with your money if you don't change your mind because that thou has thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money so see we can't think that if I pay more money maybe maybe more maybe God will like me more maybe maybe maybe I'll get to preach some day or maybe I'll get to do music some day or something like that maybe I'll I'll get what I've always wanted from God I just get more money is that the right thought no that's not it that's not a very saint if I thought that's not a very pure thought and this is the problem Simon Peter Simon was having us I'm Peter sign in the sorcerer he thought I could buy it with money and he found out he couldn't let's keep going there verse 21 now has neither part nor lot in this matter for thy heart is not right in the sight of God so he wasn't really sanctified he's not ready for God to use it busy his heart's not right thinks off I just pay little more money God will answer my prayer I can I could be like those guys if I just pay a little more money no you can't we can only be who who can we only be who God made us to be right can I be Annamarie go no can I be dr. Scott no who can I be I just got to be brother Jesse that's all I gotta be I just got to be happy being mean but you thought I can pay money and I can be like Peter I can be like James and John if I just give them a little more money God said no these have to be given for me you can't buy that you gotta be sanctified alright look at verse 22 okay guys the first 20 - thanks buddy prepaid therefore this wickedness and pray God if perhaps keep going to verse 23 even gets more severe in other words urine changes we pretend you're entering chains again like a prisoner Peter tells him you're in the bond you're in the chains of iniquity yet he was baptized right so it's important to keep serving God after you get baptized oh yes cuz he's baptized but he's still in Chains right he's still in Chains he's got a bitterness of hearty sin and he still has a heart of iniquity sometimes he does evil when he should when he knows to do good that's iniquity what a amazing story isn't that and then let's we can talk about this but he said verse 22 repent and pray to God for giving so that's what we need to do next time we just so many mom or dad anybody just so big might be alteration but did anybody just so baby mom or dad this week think about you not reaching it did anybody mistreat a brother sister this week I know in our house it happened probably the house that's right because we all make mistakes but you know it you need to do you need to say God I'm sorry I'm repenting and like like the scripture said here please forgive me everybody do that from now on if you haven't done that yet say God please forgive me I'm sorry I want to repent I want to pure heart right now let's take divided heart alright let's do another story here and a couple more to go let's go to well I want to I got seven minutes let me go to a few scriptures about this might be good for Simon the sorcerer to yeah it's going to be Bruce 1029 this is a real another one a real serious scripture but we want I want you to know it want you to know it mainly to encourage you to keep moving on with God at all times Hebrews 10:29 and this scripture so important because once we get baptized we have to move into sanctification and you ever stand still as a Christian or I can never stand still and do nothing and still be just as good as a Christian as you were no no you always have to press forward right to obey God's Word you can't stand still all right Hebrews chapter 10 in Hebrews okay you see there's chapter thirteen again two terms term a few more pages are you doing chapter 10 verse 29 29 yeah you could never say the same you can never stay to set you have to either a main effort to grow closer to God or you're gonna all the way from God you have to make efforts to be sanctified and more pure each and every day makes you look like yeah that would can you read a person [Music] - great reading thank you honey as the long scripture wasn't it long way well this one gives us a kind of a warning he makes some red lights go off saying warning warning warning God's giving us a big warning red letters red lights we'd say he says the person who gets sanctified by God but then turns away from God it's a sore punishment that means like a more severe punishment we want to be more severely punished no no we want to be rewarded like we said this morning right we want to please God just like you want to please your parents don't you but this is a war now I want you to just see this so that you know once you start drawing closer to God you can't stop you got to keep growing closer all the time how can you do that when you're 5 years old or 8 years old or 10 years old or 5 years old or 12 almost 13 how can you keep drawing closer to God read in your Bible pray yeah what else yeah staying in love with somebody even if they're mean beautiful answer yeah spending time with God loving God absolutely all good answers thanked Aves absolutely listening to preaching glory how about if you see a job that needs done at the house what should you do yeah is that your target closer to God yeah let's say it's not even your job let's say it's Penelope's job let's say it's Havens job patient you could say well no it's a man's job I don't have to do it but if you do it what does that make you taking the initiative yeah yeah that makes a huge initiative and it makes you a servant it makes you sir you just served hey right because that was her job you sir her and Jesus said the greatest among you will be what the rulers are the servants those who serve others those are all great ideas right now that's how we want to keep being sanctified by a guide to warn you with the red flashing lights we gotta be sanctified but we gotta stay sanctified or else we get punished we don't want to be punished right you want to always keep our love for Jesus more than pure okay I'm already past five o'clock I will just do one more scripture here maybe too long maybe maybe these are really really short ones why I said that okay let's go to John 5:14 these are really short John 5:14 I think you'll like these idea of a warning each chapter 5:14 John 5:14 let me do this now when you get done pretty lady why don't you get John 8:11 stupid just be right there 5:14 this is again showing how we have to stay sanctified once you get 2nd sanctified you got to stay sanctified guys they cleaned up okay this was the man who couldn't walk and Jesus you know he said rise up take up your bed and walk and then Jesus finds him in the temple and he's behold the how our made whole but sin no more lest a worse thing come upon you what could be worse did not being able to walk death that could be worse God it was he was able to do before you go back to being paralyzed yeah what could be worse than that it kind of goes with death yes to be lost lost did not have faith in Jesus Christ that be the worst thing that could happen to him but it could be some worse physical ailment as well right so I want you to see that that jesus heals that he did these great miracles but then the people had to be willing to stay clean right and they should have loved Jesus because he did the miracle and want to love serving him right so that's what we see I want to make sure you saw that their sin no more lest a worse than come around numbers stay sanctified so get your finger pointed be say today say sanctify ready stay sanctified yep you have to if you're the one that's healed I've got to stay sanctified they're also worse and will come upon you let's go Lidia John 8:11 okay this is the woman caught in the very act of doing some early awful sin and Jesus said he said I forgive you he said but go and don't do it again how many children could be honest and say there's things I do wrong but sometimes I do them again anybody be honest and say that yeah Vanessa don't sometimes right we're not getting over what we need to get over so that that happens but Jesus offers us power to get over them we have power because he said you can go and sin no more alright so when you pray and say God forgive me you can walk away and say Lord you've forgiven me I'm gonna go and sin no more but you have to have faith in that don't you yeah they have a lot of faith from now on I'm not gonna do it anymore reasonable okay last one that's going to Titus chapter 2 one of my all-time favorite scriptures I'm sure bang and his family's heard me preach this under times 9 is 211 Titus 2:11 so sanctified person can reject God's grace but we want to be sanctified children that continue in God's grace you want to keep going on to more and more of God's grace yeah up with text right after Timothy Titus 2:11 so Lydia can you help us Lydia and Sarah maybe can help us finish you Lydia 11 and 12 seats Titus 2:11 and 12 [Music] okay so God's grace has taught us some deny ungodliness and worldly lusts so to walk away from lust of the flesh lust of the eyes flee from that right run away make your arms look like they're running ready flee from those things run run run stay away from sin you have to stay away from City that's what grace will teach you right like just like Jesus said go but sin no more hey you're healed but don't sit again are also worse thing will come upon you got to stay sanctified okay okay Sarah I'm going to read up 13 thank you as we live sure we're looking for Jesus to you put your hand up to your eyes and look for Jesus as you live pure you got to look for Jesus thank you verse smarty who gave himself for us that we might try that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works these things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority let no man despise thee girls if you are going to get married one day how would you want to look would you want to go out and play in the dirt and the dust and get rid of dusty dirt on your wedding day would you want to do that yeah like that you won't be as pretty if you're dirty cuz you're covered in dirt right and mud you ever seen a woman get married in mud and muck have you ever seen that how about seeing me in her hair she ever could see why why does it look weird her natural look yeah she wants to look really nice for one person I'm sure for a lot of people that day who she want to look really nice do you think he'd be pretty happy or excited if she could've been looking all covered in dirt and mud and seaming in her hair he thinks she do you think he'd like that well that's what the Bible says Jesus is trying to purify a people for himself he's trying to sanctify a people for himself what if I went to my wedding with just jeans and a t-shirt and shirt hanging out I just went to McDonald's got ketchup on her face you think sister crystal would like that she doesn't like ketchup at all she really would not like that she wasn't you need to go brush your teeth or something like that because when we come to a special time like a wedding we want to be as pure and clean as possible right and that's what the rapture is it's the wedding between Christ and His Church right who's the church where he's gonna hear the church everybody's hands me up every believer is part of the chair who's the who's the husband the husband he's the husband I pledged to the church so are you gonna be clean or dirty for your wedding clean you better believe it I bet everybody in here was really clean I've seen a lot of them who got married they look really clean really nice that's what the Bible said Jesus died for us that he could make us clean for the wedding day for the coming for that looking for the blessing of the glorious appearing of our God and Savior Jesus Christ gonna purify this right okay all right let's stop right there let me enjoy that today okay I just thought I would go through more scriptures on sanctification and I hope it was a blessing to you did a great job read it for me I'm gonna give you guys even as a Daleks need to be reminded of our sanctification comes through the word and it comes through the Holy Ghost the same voice the bonus a good save it's the same voice that's gonna say feel
