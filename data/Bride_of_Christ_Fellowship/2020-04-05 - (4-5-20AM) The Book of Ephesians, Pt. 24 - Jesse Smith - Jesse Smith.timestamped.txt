[11:40] I'm sorry about that thank you sir
[11:45] praise God it's gonna be the house of
[11:47] Lord today
[11:47] praise God let's remember a couple
[11:50] announcements here first one is
[11:57] yesterday I did a podcast with a brother
[11:59] from Idaho it's about an hour and a half
[12:01] and it's on face on YouTube if you like
[12:03] to listen to it he's the brother that's
[12:04] trying to get us to debate the believe
[12:07] the sign and so if you like that I can
[12:09] share that link that was a nice update
[12:11] there just wanted not update you on that
[12:13] also a real good testimony a couple
[12:16] years ago we prayed for a girl who's in
[12:17] my class who was battling cancer and her
[12:20] name was Kylie she went back to the
[12:21] doctor on Wednesday for another six
[12:24] months checkup and she was clear no
[12:27] cancer by God for that one member we I
[12:34] think it was in that when we were in
[12:35] that sanctuary we prayed and fasted for
[12:37] that one we had prayer at our school for
[12:39] that one and so God is so faithful I'm
[12:41] just so encouraged by that
[12:43] you know she gives a lot of her time
[12:45] that little fifth-grade girl she gives a
[12:47] lot of her time and her ministry is
[12:48] going into the hospitals and giving sick
[12:51] kids you know bags of markers and you
[12:54] know just stuffed animals like that
[12:56] she's she does that too like two hundred
[12:58] at a time and that's her and she's the
[13:01] one who's seen angel she saw an angel
[13:03] and she said I know mr. Smith is close
[13:05] to God she knows that too and so you
[13:08] know God has done great things there and
[13:10] so we're just thankful I just thought
[13:11] that encourage you you know she went
[13:13] back to the doctor and they couldn't
[13:14] find any cancer so thank the Lord for
[13:16] that so just a nice little noun sment
[13:19] another announcement just remember we're
[13:21] trying to stay with 10 here so banging
[13:23] his daughter Lily might come that would
[13:25] make 10
[13:26] I told by the Amen like if there's a
[13:28] couple people that want to come extra we
[13:30] could have located for me to have 10 or
[13:31] 11 or 12 verse 13 or whatever the main
[13:35] thing to do is keep the six to six feet
[13:37] of distance away because the government
[13:39] can't stop anyone from gathering they
[13:41] can give guidelines and things like that
[13:43] but they can't break you know the First
[13:45] Amendment rights to free speech and
[13:48] gathering they can't they can't outlaw
[13:51] that but I do want to try to respect you
[13:54] know the laws as much as possible but
[13:56] just so you know if we do have a couple
[13:59] over that doesn't bother me or but we
[14:01] should you know try to use wisdom
[14:03] because there at the there's a Lima
[14:05] church that now has some of the Saints
[14:07] in Lima that believe the message some of
[14:09] them have coronavirus there's a couple
[14:11] that got it so they're quarantine and
[14:13] everything like that so it's just a
[14:15] reminder that it doesn't matter what
[14:16] church should go to you know this is
[14:18] just a virus this is just a sorrow and
[14:20] just like the flu except a little worse
[14:23] and we got to overcome that by God's
[14:25] grace so just keep that in mind let's
[14:27] use God's wisdom and we'll try our best
[14:30] to abide by you know the wishes of the
[14:33] government but you know God's Word is
[14:35] first in everything and I just saw to
[14:39] the number Americans that have lost
[14:41] their lives was about eighty eight
[14:43] hundred it's about eight thousand eight
[14:44] hundred so far in America but remember
[14:48] that's awful but that's that's nothing
[14:50] compared to abortion that's nothing
[14:52] compared to drug overdose so while
[14:56] that's awful Crona virus is so sad it's
[14:59] so devastating it is but there's more
[15:02] evils going on that people can overcome
[15:05] and we just got to pray that people can
[15:07] overcome those as well I'm gonna pray
[15:09] for everyone right Bob says pray for all
[15:12] men and all women so we we do that so
[15:17] let's remember sister Karen Rolfe she
[15:19] woke up and she was planning on coming
[15:20] with Sarah today but she woke up sick
[15:21] and coughing so I'm glad she stayed home
[15:24] Lord bless you sister will pray for your
[15:27] recovery but it's always wise if you're
[15:30] sick at all just stay at home
[15:31] it just wise to do that so god bless her
[15:34] let's remember brother amen had an
[15:36] unspoken request so we'll remember that
[15:38] brother and
[15:40] as a little boy from the town I grew up
[15:41] in his name's Kaden and he's battling
[15:43] cancer let's pray for him by God's grace
[15:47] God can heal through miracle or medicine
[15:50] however God chooses to heal he's the
[15:52] only healer and let's pray God get all
[15:55] the glory
[15:56] any other requests praise God let's pray
[16:03] for those in tithes and offerings I mean
[16:06] it has those by God's grace and that's
[16:08] the Lord to minister to day here have

[16:12] thank you great is your faithfulness
[16:14] great is your love to us or not we want
[16:16] to take Lourdes warning by your Holy
[16:18] Spirit and eternal perspective on these
[16:20] things we're in the midst of something
[16:22] in our life that we've never seen Lord
[16:25] and with your perspective we can see
[16:26] it's sorrow it's people ready for your
[16:30] coming shaking this country it is
[16:36] so we thank you or Tom said you'd shake
[16:39] everything but there's one kingdom that
[16:42] can't be shaded that's the key so we
[16:45] thank you know that we are a part by
[16:46] birth I spiritual Earth and my spiritual
[16:51] blood blood of Christ were part of the
[16:53] family of God part of a kingdom that can

[35:01] Lord of armies praise God Angel armies
[35:04] thank the Lord and he said the angel of
[35:06] the lord encamps around those who fear
[35:08] the Lord so we're grateful we have an
[35:11] army around us and so many times God
[35:13] protects us all throughout the day every
[35:15] day 24 hours seven days a week there's
[35:19] times he allows us to be tested but even
[35:21] in the test he said I'll never leave you
[35:23] no forsake you so we thank the Lord for
[35:25] His amazing grace as you're turning
[35:27] there Ephesians chapter 6 verse 10 just
[35:30] ruined I want to renounce this - I
[35:31] forgot to say this brother Amen reminded
[35:33] me about this coming week as Easter I
[35:35] just forgot about it you know next
[35:37] Sunday so we'll have a Friday night
[35:39] service if you can't attend that I'll
[35:42] have another Saturday night service so
[35:43] I'll send out a text cuz I want
[35:45] everybody to have communion I want
[35:46] Beatrice Lord willing if she like to
[35:47] come we'll divide up you know half the
[35:50] church can come on Friday half on
[35:51] Saturday so everybody can have communion
[35:55] with the Lord and with each other so I
[35:58] forgot I wanted to announce that let's
[35:59] do that Friday and Saturday I'm on
[36:01] spring break this week so I have no work
[36:03] it's not free time brother so I can
[36:07] study up and be prepared and let's have
[36:10] a Friday night service for Good Friday
[36:12] and then I'll preach again Saturday
[36:14] whatever time you know you're available
[36:17] so by God's grace and then we'll have
[36:19] one Sunday Easter service at our regular
[36:21] time as long as the law and everything
[36:24] as long as the government says that's
[36:25] okay so fees in Chapter six and I'll
[36:30] text everybody about that just to remind
[36:32] you because I kind of forgot about
[36:32] announcing that - he's in chapter 6
[36:36] verse 10 like to finish Lord willing
[36:40] maybe we'll finish the book of Ephesians
[36:42] and then I think I want to go Galatians
[36:44] Ephesians I want to go right into
[36:46] Colossians kalash
[36:47] is very similar to Ephesians it seems as
[36:50] if Paul wrote it right around the same
[36:53] time and he echoed he may have wrote
[36:55] both at the same time and put a lot of
[36:58] the same thoughts into both books but
[37:00] there are some special things he said of
[37:03] course in Colossians that we need to
[37:06] emphasize I'm sorry Philippians is after
[37:09] Ephesians but Ephesians 6:10 so Lord
[37:12] willing we'll go to Philippians next if
[37:14] God is willing and that's all inspired
[37:17] by brother Branham said the millions
[37:20] shouted out were resting on Paul's
[37:21] gospel and so if there's a gospel we
[37:23] need to know it's Paul's gospel praise
[37:25] God you're resting on that he said to
[37:27] take one word away or the change it was
[37:29] to take a curse upon you so we must
[37:32] really know Paul's gospel right from the
[37:34] scripture praise God so Ephesians
[37:36] chapter 6 verse 10 and then we'll do our
[37:39] memory verses so you know we sent me
[37:40] some verses there so we'll do our that
[37:42] reverses right out of a Philippians 4 so
[37:45] let's just read verse 10 together and
[37:48] then we'll go to Philippians four seven
[37:50] and eight
[37:50] so it's read Ephesians 6:10 let's begin
[37:52] on three one two three finally my
[37:55] brethren be strong in the Lord and in
[37:59] the power of his might let's go to
[38:02] Philippians four seven and eight just a
[38:06] couple books their visions four seven
[38:14] and eight this be our memory verses we
[38:15] read it that just asked the Lord to
[38:16] write it upon our hearts praise God
[38:20] verses seven eight let's read seven
[38:22] eight together one two three and the
[38:25] peace of God which passeth all
[38:28] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[38:31] minds through Christ Jesus finally
[38:34] brethren whatsoever things are true
[38:36] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[38:39] things are just whatsoever things are
[38:44] pure whatsoever things are lovely
[38:46] whatsoever things are of good report if
[38:50] there be any virtue and if there be any
[38:54] praise think on these things what
[38:57] beautiful promises let's have a word of
[38:59] Prayer if you have anything on your
[39:00] heart let's just make
[39:00] to God here Lord you see the hands that
[39:03] are raised you see the hearts that are
[39:04] raised father we love you and we realize
[39:07] this is the time to be gathered together
[39:08] to receive from you we've given our
[39:11] sacrifice of praise Lord and we offer
[39:13] that freely to you from sincere hearts
[39:15] and we've worshiped you we've watered
[39:17] Lord to seed in our heart Lord and now
[39:19] we just pray Lord that your spirit will
[39:21] come and quicken the seed and cause it
[39:23] to grow in our lives dear God and
[39:25] minister to the needs that we have Lord
[39:27] God I'm just a man I can do nothing
[39:29] Lord God but you Lord come through the
[39:32] the channel of yielded vessels Lord God
[39:35] so coming your great power of your word
[39:36] and Lord speak to us today meet every
[39:39] need upon your people's hearts they're
[39:41] your sheep you're the great Shepherd I'm
[39:43] a sheep Lord guide us great Bishop of
[39:45] our souls lead us to green pastures Lord
[39:48] lead us to still waters Lord God restore
[39:51] our souls in the midst of this virus
[39:53] Lord and this this distress upon the
[39:56] nations Lord and guide us Lord has the
[39:59] great faithful Shepherd Lord God you are
[40:01] our Shepherd Lord and we we shall not
[40:03] want
[40:04] we shall not lack of any good thing in
[40:06] this hour and we give you the praise in
[40:08] Jesus Christ's name and the church said
[40:10] Amen god bless she's been seated praise
[40:12] God praise the Lord so we like to look
[40:24] at this thought again Lydia I do have
[40:27] quotes up there you can have a few
[40:29] quotes and things to reference you know
[40:33] I appreciate you know Easter and Palm
[40:36] you know days Palm Sunday a lot of
[40:38] churches today they can't gather but you
[40:40] know they would they would just bring
[40:42] palms and wave palms and there's nothing
[40:44] wrong with that I think that's a fine
[40:45] thing but I think it's I think it's a
[40:47] sign that a lot of churches are not
[40:50] right when the only palms they can raise
[40:52] our natural palms we should be able to
[40:54] raise our palms our hands in the turn
[40:57] true worship of the Lord Jesus Christ
[40:59] and I'm glad and you know Church I'm not
[41:01] being critical but they call this Holy
[41:03] Week every week is Holy Week to us and
[41:06] the way you know is you look at you know
[41:08] look at Mardi Gras when they I'm a lot
[41:11] of friends I have a lot of friends on
[41:12] Facebook you know and a lot of them are
[41:14] dime and
[41:14] I'm not criticizing them but Mardi Gras
[41:17] they'll drink beer they'll though
[41:19] indulge in all the the fleshly less and
[41:22] then come you know the ashes of the next
[41:26] what is it Monday 3rd or Monday Thursday
[41:28] I can't remember Ash Wednesday they call
[41:30] it they'll put ashes on their head like
[41:32] to kind of represent now they're gonna
[41:34] be real sincere we need to be sincere
[41:37] every week praise God hallelujah
[41:40] every Wednesday's Ash Wednesday in other
[41:43] words we're not natural ashes but we
[41:45] repent in in spiritual ashes right we
[41:48] repent we humble ourselves we humble
[41:50] ourselves every Wednesday every Sunday
[41:53] and so I just want to just reiterate
[41:55] that again like brother Branham he
[41:57] majored on that I'm sure I didn't major
[41:59] but he made a major statement on that
[42:00] and he said how the church does Lent
[42:03] where they give up something in brother
[42:05] brand again he says it every well he
[42:08] says that all the time on the tape he
[42:10] says we do an everlasting lent every
[42:13] season is lent season to us in other
[42:15] words we're constantly giving up
[42:17] something you know they give up
[42:17] chocolate or they give up Facebook or or
[42:20] they give up YouTube or or they give up
[42:22] cussing you know but a Christian is
[42:24] always Underland they're always
[42:26] sacrificing and giving up something for
[42:28] God's glory praise God amen and so we we
[42:32] have to do that we have to constantly
[42:33] give up things for the kingdom of God
[42:36] and we're happy to do it
[42:37] praise God so this is part 24 just a few
[42:43] things to show by God's grace I want to
[42:46] get my notes together here and we're
[42:49] looking at I want to just look at the
[42:50] full armor of God here because I
[42:53] preached it a couple years ago but as I
[42:55] wrote the chapter about the rapture it
[42:59] became clear to me and it was a fresh
[43:00] revelation to me that when Paul is
[43:03] dealing with the rapture he tells us the
[43:05] only way to be ready is to be fully
[43:08] armored as a Christian soldier so I want
[43:10] to just reiterate that and back to
[43:12] Ephesians sit I'm sorry 1st
[43:15] Thessalonians 5 I want to go back to
[43:16] that by God's grace and look at that
[43:19] just for a moment you know the chapter 4
[43:22] is the rapture chapter first
[43:24] Thessalonians 4 and then chapter 5
[43:28] as we looked at on Wednesday is the
[43:30] season of the rapture he says we'll know
[43:33] the times and seasons and will know it
[43:36] because we are not drunken and we are
[43:39] not sleeping and I believe - I believe
[43:44] this is scriptural the foolish virgin
[43:46] isn't sleeping either because remember
[43:47] she heard the shout she in the parable
[43:50] the ten virgins the foolish virgin woke
[43:53] up and she hears the shout in other
[43:56] words she hears the message of the hour
[43:57] and she's getting she's trying to get
[44:00] ready but she realizes she's not born
[44:02] again and I heard brother Donny Reagan
[44:04] said I was a sin to his sermon last week
[44:07] and he says he's heard reports about
[44:10] churches around the world or even
[44:13] through even through their live services
[44:15] are getting lots of extra clicks and
[44:17] people are contacting the pastor saying
[44:20] we're getting saved we're getting saved
[44:21] and that's good many people will get
[44:25] saved during this time listen every time
[44:27] there's a shaking number 911 911 cause
[44:30] Simon to go to Craig's Bible study so he
[44:32] could hear the message
[44:34] praise God glory so every time there's
[44:37] this natural worldwide or national
[44:40] disaster it's always done to shake up
[44:43] people so they'll get their check
[44:45] they'll check their lives with God's
[44:46] Word praise God and then in doing that
[44:49] when they get shaken up if they're drawn
[44:51] to Christ if they really love God and
[44:53] they really sell out they'll go deeper
[44:56] in the things of God but what we know
[44:59] today a lot of people will get saved at
[45:01] this time nor the coronavirus which they
[45:03] will but they've got to go all the way
[45:06] and they've got to get the oil available
[45:08] that the oil is available right now
[45:10] praise God
[45:11] anybody can be borned again they just
[45:13] got to obey the Word of God amen
[45:15] they got to keep hungry and thirsting
[45:17] for more righteousness and Jesus will
[45:20] fill them with the Holy Ghost it's very
[45:22] simple he said he said if you hunger and
[45:25] thirst for righteousness you shall be
[45:27] filled
[45:28] praise God and so it's available to
[45:31] anyone who's hungry and thirsty for it
[45:33] praise God but there'll be many people
[45:36] that just become a foolish virgins at
[45:38] this time and they'll live true to God
[45:40] they'll say oh my this has never
[45:41] happened
[45:41] we've never had runs at the grocery
[45:43] store we've never been lacking chicken
[45:45] before or toilet paper like our grocery
[45:48] store here that's what it lacks it they
[45:50] got everything except no toilet paper
[45:52] and chicken they got it some weeks they
[45:54] don't have it next weeks you know last
[45:55] week they had it this week they don't
[45:56] have it so there's all these runs on it
[45:59] I think people fear the Lord and and get
[46:02] closer to God which is a good thing but
[46:04] if we're really hungry we'll want to see
[46:06] Jesus Christ in every part of our life
[46:08] praise God and that's where the wise
[46:10] virgins she's more wise she takes more
[46:13] time to prepare extra oil he's God
[46:17] that's the difference between the wise
[46:19] and the foolish the wise prepared she oh
[46:21] my god this might be a long journey
[46:23] praise God I need more oil I need all
[46:26] the oil I can get praise God amen and I
[46:29] want to go out to meet the bridegroom
[46:30] praise God I want to be ready then he
[46:32] moment to go meet the bridegroom so it's
[46:35] all about preparedness and wisdom the
[46:38] wise version prepares and wisdom for the
[46:40] foolish she recognizes she's not
[46:42] sleeping but the world is sleeping there
[46:46] in a drunken stupor they don't even know
[46:49] what's going on but thank God we know
[46:52] what's going on praise God and that's
[46:53] that's what I'm saying thank the Lord
[46:55] that we know the Word of God amen thank
[46:57] God it's a thing to rejoice in now 1st
[47:00] Thessalonians 5 here I want to get back
[47:02] to this because it speaks of the armor
[47:06] of God now look at verse 7 let's go to
[47:09] 1st Thessalonians 5 7 for they that
[47:12] sleep sleep in the night and they that
[47:16] be drunken are drunken in the night but
[47:19] let us who are of the day now isn't it
[47:21] striking there's darkness and light at
[47:24] the same time right so a person who's
[47:29] not confessed their sins and not saved
[47:31] they are they're living in a dark
[47:33] spiritual state so right now currently
[47:36] it is a spiritual dark time for sinners
[47:39] but it's a spiritual light time for us
[47:41] praise God
[47:43] amen there's actually two spiritual
[47:45] conditions you're either living under
[47:47] you're either living under darkness
[47:49] spiritual drunkenness you know drunken
[47:52] with the things of the world or you're
[47:53] living under spiritual light and
[47:55] Paul says we are of the day and so he
[47:58] says we are sober which means of course
[48:01] not drunk we're in our right mind we're
[48:03] alert we're putting on the breastplate
[48:05] of faith and love and foreign helmet the
[48:10] hope of salvation I love that he's
[48:12] saying we're putting it on right now
[48:13] amen praise God in his day but they
[48:17] meant in his day they were putting it on
[48:19] he's God see that's what our lives are a
[48:22] lot our lives are just filled with
[48:23] putting the armor on all the time praise
[48:26] God making sure we got everything ready
[48:28] to go our lives are we are in the
[48:31] process of putting it on and keeping
[48:34] ourselves armored because it's a war
[48:36] praise God we are in the midst of the
[48:39] law praise the Lord
[48:40] remember of even's for Ephesians 5 you
[48:44] know we just moved from chapter 5 to 6
[48:46] in Ephesians 5 he said submit yourselves
[48:48] one to another
[48:49] he says wives submit to your husband's
[48:51] husbands love your wives children submit
[48:54] to your parents slaves submit to your
[48:56] masters and then he breaks into how
[48:58] you're a soldier amen
[49:00] so it's so a husband is armored to be
[49:04] armored with armor of God a wife is to
[49:06] be armored with the armor of God the
[49:08] children are to be armored with the
[49:10] armor of God praise God slaves slaves to
[49:14] the economic system of America are to be
[49:17] armored with the armor of God amen this
[49:20] is what he's building upon he says and
[49:22] if you're armored
[49:23] then you're gonna act the way Christ
[49:25] would act praise God and you'll act in
[49:28] love you're acting submission you'll
[49:29] humble yourself yes you you can humble
[49:32] yourself as a soldier every police
[49:34] officer I know humbles themselves how
[49:37] many times have I I say it like this but
[49:39] man couple times I've locked my keys
[49:41] into my car and I've had cops come and
[49:43] help me out I've gotten three accidents
[49:47] and every time it was my fault I've hit
[49:48] three people when the first time was the
[49:50] worst time where the girl just got out
[49:52] screaming and cried after that I just
[49:53] barely bump people like a little scratch
[49:55] and every time that officer humbles
[49:59] himself he submits himself to my problem
[50:03] right he's got all the armor on sister
[50:06] Deo he's got a gun he's got mace he's
[50:08] got a
[50:09] he humbly but yet he's fully armored and
[50:11] he comes to Humble himself to this
[50:13] little person who makes their mistake oh
[50:16] praise God that's to be us we're to be
[50:19] fully armored but yet submit and help
[50:22] out other people when they accidentally
[50:24] make a mistake right
[50:25] like I accidentally locked my keys now
[50:27] it's been a number of years thank God
[50:28] for that
[50:29] we you know we do silly things that we
[50:32] make foolish mistakes or say like that
[50:34] but those who are armored are cut we
[50:36] seen all the time you know a
[50:37] firefighters they're armed right with
[50:39] axes and they got everything that
[50:41] they're armed but they humble themselves
[50:42] and they serve other people that's
[50:45] really what Paul's saying a Christian is
[50:47] fully armored but yet we were able to
[50:49] humble ourselves to those who make
[50:52] mistakes and help them out and serve
[50:54] them we're to be public servants as well
[50:56] praise God
[50:58] amen and the later newer too is in our
[51:01] homes that's where Paul he ends this
[51:03] beautiful letter by saying if you are a
[51:05] servant he said serve those that are
[51:07] closest to you in your home because if
[51:10] you can't live it in your home you're
[51:12] not gonna live it anywhere else praise
[51:13] God hallelujah so I think it's so
[51:16] beautiful he ends it by saying look at
[51:18] your home live look at your job like he
[51:20] talks to slaves right in their masters
[51:22] look at those your closest around love
[51:24] them serve them and have on the armor of
[51:27] God because what is Satan gonna try new
[51:30] he's gonna try to divide the homes right
[51:32] he's gonna try to put he's trying to
[51:34] inject little lies and and and pride in
[51:36] and lusts and arrogance and all these
[51:38] things he's gonna try to inject that
[51:40] amongst us but we must stand up for each
[51:42] other and serve one another praise God
[51:44] amen in the midst of Satan's of the
[51:48] darts that he's firing at us
[51:50] we must put up the shield of faith so
[51:53] let me just say like this yesterday on
[51:54] that interview at an interview you know
[51:56] on the podcast there's a couple chances
[51:59] I could have really spoke evil about the
[52:01] believe the sign people or the
[52:03] jeffersonville people there was
[52:04] opportunities where Satan could have
[52:06] tempt me to do that but what I try to do
[52:08] brother bang is put up the shield of
[52:10] faith praise God and and instead of
[52:12] attacking them just in a lovely way in a
[52:15] loving way say I disagree but I'm sure
[52:17] they're real sincere people I'm sure
[52:20] they're there are nice people right
[52:22] there kind people
[52:23] so when we knew that church we're
[52:24] standing up and we're putting our shield
[52:26] to protect those that we disagree with
[52:29] praise God and that's what we should do
[52:31] if someone's trying to attack you or
[52:33] just protect them praise God like
[52:35] brother Anderson make make the circle
[52:38] bigger praise God I got to stand up for
[52:40] brother Tim Humes who's he's under a lot
[52:42] attack right now but I called him a good
[52:43] godly man and a wonderful pastor you
[52:47] know the enemy could have tried me to
[52:48] get me to say evil against people and
[52:50] this like they could say evil against me
[52:52] but we should use the shield of faith to
[52:54] protect others praise God the police
[52:56] officers are trying to protect us right
[52:58] and so with more powerful weapons than
[53:01] that because we've got God's Word amen
[53:03] because remember Jesus said you've got
[53:05] keys aim don't worry you've got keys
[53:09] than the kingdom of God amen
[53:10] and just remember Jesus prayed for them
[53:13] on the cross in the moment he could have
[53:15] cursed him he said Father forgive them
[53:18] they know not what they do
[53:19] hey man here's the keys Jesus said
[53:21] whatever you bind on earth
[53:23] it'll be bound in heaven whatever you
[53:25] loose on earth will be loosed in heaven
[53:27] amen praise God we've got the keys like
[53:30] they caught the police officer we got
[53:32] this the sword of it like a real soldier
[53:35] and we have the ability to be merciful
[53:37] to other people let's be careful who we
[53:41] curse let's be careful trying to curse
[53:43] anybody praise I just try to curse the
[53:45] devil pray Scott I really try not to
[53:48] curse anybody uh I want everyone to be
[53:51] saved mercy by God's grace now should we
[53:56] warn people absolutely we should warn
[53:59] people but we should also extend grace
[54:01] at the same time remember I just read it
[54:04] yesterday
[54:04] the Apostle Paul before he was saved
[54:06] Saints he was going around dragging
[54:09] Christians of prison and Bible said he
[54:12] was trying to get them to blaspheme so
[54:16] he would he would be pulling them around
[54:17] saying I'm gonna put you in prison
[54:19] unless you say Jesus was of Beelzebub he
[54:23] was doing the most evil things you could
[54:25] think of and we wouldn't want to give up
[54:27] on him right and member Jesus said he
[54:31] said when he knocked him down he said
[54:33] why are you kicking against the pricks
[54:36] what does that mean that means ox and ox
[54:40] they had goats here like which were
[54:41] little spikes and and and and if you're
[54:45] hurting yourself so the whole time Paul
[54:47] was dragging them to prison
[54:49] it was stealing his joy it was stealing
[54:51] his happiness
[54:52] it was stealing any piece he had he was
[54:54] hurting himself but Jesus came Jesus
[54:58] came to set him free praise God amen
[55:00] a church when we hurt others when we
[55:03] when we say evil things about others
[55:04] were just really hurting ourselves amen
[55:07] we're hurting ourselves that we can't do
[55:10] that and Paul was trying to say just
[55:12] blasting just say he's of Beelzebub and
[55:15] they're like no we can't do that he's
[55:16] real to us how do you know because he's
[55:19] in my heart praise God hey man how do
[55:22] you know Jesus as we are I didn't see
[55:23] him die I don't know but his spirits in
[55:26] my life amen praise God and I felt
[55:29] forgiven I felt the power of God
[55:32] I felt his love and I have a love inside
[55:34] of me I can't explain I just know it's a
[55:37] divine holy love praise God amen and so
[55:42] people mind a curse Paul but look what
[55:43] he turned into
[55:44] the greatest missionary there ever was
[55:47] now by you know bragging on Paul but
[55:50] bragging on the Holy Ghost in Paul
[55:51] praise so putting it on verse 8 unless
[55:56] two pieces of the armor the breastplate
[55:59] and the helmet the hope of salvation
[56:02] verse 9 I love it for God hath not
[56:05] appointed us to wrath but to obtain
[56:08] salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ hey
[56:12] man so Paul's picture is we are we are
[56:16] spiritual soldiers and we can see
[56:20] everything but sinners are drunken
[56:22] they're sleeping they're not fighting
[56:24] for God at all they're not doing
[56:25] anything for God but we should be awake
[56:29] and ready and we know the lights the
[56:31] sun's up the lights are on and darts are
[56:34] gonna fly too at us from everywhere
[56:37] darts are going to be shooting at and
[56:39] Paul says be armored with the armor of
[56:42] God because you know there's going to be
[56:45] attacks and you'll be ready and you're
[56:48] able to overcome
[56:49] praise God your you are armored with it
[56:52] praise God
[56:53] you're not you're not defenseless you
[56:56] have defenses praise God we have five
[56:59] defenses and I want to look at those
[57:01] here the whole armour of God now I
[57:03] showed this a slide last week I believe
[57:06] we have five defensive pieces and one
[57:11] offensive let me get to my notes here
[57:13] yeah here we go so our only hope church
[57:19] is to put on the full armor of God and
[57:25] we have six pieces like a six is the
[57:28] number of man praise God six pieces you
[57:32] have five defensive grace and one
[57:34] offensive praise God hallelujah and
[57:37] they're all put on my prayer because the
[57:40] Bible says that in Ephesians 6:18 now
[57:44] let's go over these a little bit by
[57:46] God's grace we put these on that we may
[57:49] be able to withstand in the evil day and
[57:52] having done all to stand praise God in
[57:56] other words we're not a laying down
[57:58] police officer we're not a sleeping
[58:01] soldier we are an active soldier praise
[58:04] God we are there we're not just sitting
[58:06] on the sidelines we are in service
[58:09] praise God we're not resting we're not
[58:12] on vacation we're working for God amen
[58:15] he said stand and all that you do he
[58:19] said stand praise God now let me go back
[58:23] I just want to show the pictures here we
[58:26] looked at this last week if you didn't
[58:27] see the picture it's a really good
[58:28] picture Paul after all the the love your
[58:32] family he says but you're a soldier and
[58:34] he got that from Jesus Christ Isaiah
[58:36] wrote about Jesus Christ and how he had
[58:39] the helmet of salvation and the
[58:42] breastplate of righteousness speaking of
[58:43] the Messiah
[58:44] so our picture though our picture of a
[58:47] soldier is actually taken from Isaiah's
[58:50] writing about Christ Christ was fully
[58:52] armored because he lived by every word
[58:54] that proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[58:56] praise God and that was our picture we
[58:59] read that last Sunday now I want to just
[59:01] show our pictures again here
[59:03] I preached this a couple years ago but
[59:06] let's get right to it here just I want
[59:09] to show these again I'm just gonna go
[59:10] quickly through these now uh let me go
[59:14] around the wrong page here okay I must
[59:22] have skipped something here bear with me
[59:25] here looking for oh yeah there - sorry
[59:32] orders I'm out of order here pardon me
[59:35] boys of truth now girded loins met a man
[59:39] or woman could tuck in their long
[59:41] flowing robe into their belt enabling
[59:44] them to travel run or work so in the
[59:48] same way a Christians mind is gird up or
[59:51] tucked into the Bible truth see
[59:55] sometimes jerks are it happened to me
[59:57] this week I slept in I forgot to set my
[59:58] alarm and I instantly went to youtube
[1:00:00] and I started watching the coronavirus
[1:00:02] update and I did the wrong thing I got
[1:00:06] my mind in the news first instead of my
[1:00:08] mind into God's Word and I could tell
[1:00:12] from that moment like oh Lord I got to
[1:00:14] get back I got to get my back in my
[1:00:15] routine because you got a you got a he
[1:00:18] said gird up the loins of your mind is
[1:00:20] the first thing and that's why people
[1:00:22] struggle many times the first thing they
[1:00:24] start feeding their mind upon is trouble
[1:00:26] right it's a trouble or or a bad news or
[1:00:31] something like that but just like you
[1:00:34] tuck in that lone robe so you got to
[1:00:37] tuck your mind into the truth and that
[1:00:39] means you're calmly prepared because he
[1:00:42] said be sober right sober is calmness
[1:00:45] when your minds in the Word of God
[1:00:47] you're calm because you know God's
[1:00:49] promises can never fail you're not
[1:00:52] disturbed you're all calm about it
[1:00:54] because I know I know God God's will
[1:00:57] will be done praise God and no matter
[1:00:59] what no matter whatever God allows in my
[1:01:01] life just like job I can say the Lord
[1:01:03] gives the Lord takes away blessed be the
[1:01:06] name of the Lord and job said no he slay
[1:01:08] me yet I'll trust him amen
[1:01:10] see because you're so calm your mind is
[1:01:14] so set on God's Word
[1:01:17] so when your mind is tucked into the
[1:01:19] truth you're prepared to be victorious
[1:01:22] in spiritual mind battles and successful
[1:01:25] in your ministry's work so you're free
[1:01:28] now you're ready to work because your
[1:01:30] mind is ready oh I know I got a battle
[1:01:32] today right so that's how your mind is
[1:01:37] the belt of truth now brother Adam says
[1:01:39] it like this he says I try to put a
[1:01:42] quote up there for every one of them
[1:01:43] yeah the belt holds the rest of it

[1:02:30] praise God now he says the next he said
[1:02:32] put on the breastplate of righteousness
[1:02:35] here's where I got a little out of order
[1:02:36] here so pardon me not sure why I did
[1:02:39] that with the order what's really coming
[1:02:41] together I finished the chapter
[1:02:43] yesterday so I'm 57% done I finished the
[1:02:48] chapter on Israel's blindness I've I
[1:02:49] just feel so good after these things I'm
[1:02:51] like huh I'm getting there by God's
[1:02:53] grace I'm getting there cuz I mean
[1:02:56] everybody deserves a chance to know the
[1:02:58] finished mystery of God I'm doing that
[1:03:00] that's why I'm doing it because I
[1:03:01] believe that and I believe I have a
[1:03:02] partner playing it I'm already sending
[1:03:04] my modesty book all around the world I'm
[1:03:06] emailing it to people it goes all around
[1:03:08] Australia and New Zealand wanted to be a
[1:03:11] place where I sent all my books and then
[1:03:14] they would distribute it but I said I
[1:03:15] can't afford that I don't know how to do
[1:03:16] that I don't know how to mail things
[1:03:18] overseas but I've had people tell me
[1:03:20] that like we want to be a hub and you
[1:03:22] can send us your books and distributor I
[1:03:23] said well I said I said just order them
[1:03:25] for Amazon I don't know I don't have
[1:03:27] time to do all that you imagine sending
[1:03:29] 200 bucks over to New Zealand
[1:03:30] I can't do that right now I don't know
[1:03:32] how to do that but but see all of us
[1:03:35] have a part and and all of us can do a
[1:03:38] part praise God and why as you pay your
[1:03:41] tithes and offerings you're doing your
[1:03:43] part to spread this message amen
[1:03:45] hallelujah that's exactly right
[1:03:47] if you can't go send somebody praise God
[1:03:51] and we're sending right now we said
[1:03:53] Craig and Simon and Jason de maras we've
[1:03:55] given them money to brother Ben arrived
[1:03:56] the last time he went we gave him a
[1:03:58] little offering there to go on his trip
[1:03:59] to Trinidad and so we just do our little
[1:04:02] part by God's grace now the breastplate
[1:04:05] he said put on the breastplate of faith
[1:04:08] and righteousness now a physical
[1:04:12] breastplate what does it protect your
[1:04:14] heart and your most important organs
[1:04:16] right because you can live without a leg
[1:04:19] you can live without an arm and ear but
[1:04:23] you cannot live without a heart to
[1:04:25] praise God so Paul said put on a
[1:04:28] breastplate to protect your vital organs
[1:04:32] from your chest down to your waist and
[1:04:34] so what does that mean just as you
[1:04:38] protect your most vital organs
[1:04:41] you must your righteous obedient
[1:04:44] Christian life of integrity protects
[1:04:48] your heart from Satan's attack on our
[1:04:51] character so in other words when you
[1:04:54] live righteously the righteousness of
[1:04:56] Christ protects your life praise God
[1:05:00] it's a breastplate of righteousness
[1:05:02] Christ's righteousness protects my life
[1:05:06] amen
[1:05:06] why because all my sin was put on him
[1:05:10] and all his righteousness is put on me
[1:05:13] praise God amen hallelujah
[1:05:15] so what's protecting my very life the
[1:05:18] righteousness of Christ sacrifice and
[1:05:21] we've got to put that on every day I've
[1:05:23] got to remember every day brother bang
[1:05:24] that Jesus died for my sins because I
[1:05:27] can get really depressed I can get
[1:05:29] really discouraged about what Jesse
[1:05:31] Smith does because I fall short of the
[1:05:33] glory of God many times but I must put
[1:05:35] on the breastplate of Christ's
[1:05:37] righteousness and knowing that Christ's
[1:05:40] righteousness protects my life they
[1:05:42] meant
[1:05:44] hallelujah so first my mind is ready
[1:05:46] it's ready to fight it's ready to go and
[1:05:50] now my my heart my life is protected by
[1:05:54] Christ's righteousness not mine
[1:05:59] praise God where's brother man saying
[1:06:04] yeah he said when he's the breastplate
[1:06:07] of righteousness right do what's right
[1:06:09] so righteousness is doing what's right
[1:06:10] he said I got the Word of God in you
[1:06:14] doing what's right
[1:06:16] thanks God to see Christ's righteousness
[1:06:18] is upon you you can do the right thing
[1:06:21] because his anointings upon you praise
[1:06:23] God and to protect Satan from attacking
[1:06:26] your life
[1:06:27] oh you don't live you don't live high
[1:06:30] enough or you don't live close enough to
[1:06:31] God don't ever say you're not a good
[1:06:33] Christian don't ever say you're weak in
[1:06:36] faith because boban said that's he said
[1:06:38] power of life and death is in the tongue
[1:06:41] praise God don't ever admit little
[1:06:44] things like that things that will that
[1:06:47] you criticize don't criticize yourself
[1:06:49] because what you're doing Church is
[1:06:51] you're taking off your armor we should
[1:06:54] say I'm a son of God I'm a daughter of
[1:06:57] God my mind is is is ready to fight
[1:07:00] praise God Christ's righteousness
[1:07:02] protects my life amen
[1:07:05] see you and I our righteousness will
[1:07:08] always fail because we have none praise
[1:07:10] God how do you but its Christ's
[1:07:13] righteousness is what it protects us and
[1:07:15] we must remember and confess that that
[1:07:18] it's his righteousness which defends my
[1:07:21] life amen
[1:07:23] see Saint likes to try to shoot a little
[1:07:25] dart in between and get to our heart but
[1:07:28] Jesus Christ's righteousness protects us
[1:07:30] praise God if I said the devil says oh
[1:07:34] you're not righteous well that's true
[1:07:35] I'm not it's it's not my armor I'm
[1:07:38] putting on it's Christ he's God amen
[1:07:41] it's Jesus Christ armor that I'm putting
[1:07:44] on his righteousness if I was righteous
[1:07:46] I wouldn't need his righteousness but I
[1:07:48] need his righteousness because I know
[1:07:50] I'm not that's why I put on his
[1:07:53] righteousness every morning
[1:07:55] praise God maybe on Friday night I like
[1:07:57] to
[1:07:57] a part of The Passion of Christ where we
[1:07:59] can see Jesus you know that just always
[1:08:01] we see him you know flogged and beaten
[1:08:04] and it might be too you know for the
[1:08:06] children it might be little too intense
[1:08:08] even for some of our other ones but
[1:08:10] maybe I'd like to do that sometime and
[1:08:11] just see him crucified because it gives
[1:08:13] us such a picture if he had to go
[1:08:15] through all that and he did he did it
[1:08:18] willingly he didn't have to but he
[1:08:20] willingly went through it then we should
[1:08:21] have a great assurance that his
[1:08:24] sacrifice was accepted to God that all
[1:08:27] of our sin was placed upon him that
[1:08:30] means all of his righteousness is upon
[1:08:32] us amen
[1:08:33] praise God it's just a reminder that
[1:08:35] every time he was whipped every time he
[1:08:38] was stuck with the spear every time he
[1:08:40] was mocked or slapped
[1:08:41] it was our punishment being poured out
[1:08:44] on him praise God he took them the brunt
[1:08:47] of all of our sin he paid the price so
[1:08:49] we don't have to pay it praise God
[1:08:51] Berryman so he says put on the
[1:08:56] breastplate of righteousness right be
[1:09:00] righteous just like Jesus Christ
[1:09:03] the helmet of salvation a physical
[1:09:06] helmet protects the head which is the
[1:09:08] command center right and it's the most
[1:09:10] complex organ in the human body is the
[1:09:12] brain right so just like it protects the
[1:09:16] most complex organ or your command
[1:09:19] center so does the hope of salvation
[1:09:22] which is the assurance that were saved
[1:09:26] and forgiven by Jesus sacrifice that
[1:09:29] protects us from Satan's attempts to
[1:09:32] make us doubt our salvation praise God
[1:09:35] amen he gives us the hope of salvation
[1:09:38] to protect the Millar command center
[1:09:43] praise God see cuz if you start saying
[1:09:46] oh I don't even know if I'm saved you'll
[1:09:48] start the command center will start
[1:09:50] allowing you to do certain things you
[1:09:52] shouldn't do
[1:09:53] right the command center is where the
[1:09:57] mind it sends the signals right lift
[1:09:59] your arm then the brain sends out first
[1:10:02] and and if we're not protecting our
[1:10:04] command center we'll send the wrong
[1:10:06] commands praise God we must remember I'm
[1:10:11] I didn't say myself but I know I'm saved
[1:10:14] and I have assurance because it's the
[1:10:17] hope of salvation praise God Jesus gives
[1:10:22] us the defense of the helmet of
[1:10:25] salvation to protect us from something
[1:10:28] hitting our command center and making us
[1:10:30] do the wrong commands for his God amen
[1:10:34] thank the Lord the hope of salvation
[1:10:36] praise God it protects our command
[1:10:40] center so that the commands are the
[1:10:42] right ones that are listed out praise
[1:10:45] God but a man says see the mind in the
[1:10:48] air the head covers the head so all the
[1:10:51] commands from our natural mind right so
[1:10:55] now we can command ourselves to move and
[1:10:58] to do actions right and to obey the Holy
[1:11:00] Spirit all our commands are protected by
[1:11:03] the hope of salvation praise God in
[1:11:05] other words no matter what I choose I
[1:11:07] know I'm saved even if I make the wrong
[1:11:10] choice God will correct me and he'll
[1:11:12] bring me back to the perfect will of God
[1:11:13] I know I'm not lost praise God amen

[1:14:06] time you can go anywhere
[1:14:09] that the voice of God is leading you to
[1:14:10] go because your feet are shod with the
[1:14:14] gospel of the preparation of peace you
[1:14:17] you you and I can hear the Holy Spirit
[1:14:20] not just to call that person or reach
[1:14:23] out to that one or help out that one we
[1:14:25] can go any time or any place because we
[1:14:28] feel the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[1:14:30] praise God getting our timing right a
[1:14:33] lot of times you and I will probably see
[1:14:35] it and text our emails
[1:14:36] but I got to email a couple
[1:14:38] weeks ago that said my that was right on
[1:14:39] time I just I forget what it was I think
[1:14:41] I shared the testimony I was with uh I
[1:14:44] was with my brother or something like
[1:14:46] that yeah yeah yeah when his when his
[1:14:48] son were in the hospital I hadn't
[1:14:50] contacted him for weeks
[1:14:50] all of a sudden brother bang I just felt
[1:14:52] lead I need to reach out and talk to my
[1:14:53] brother
[1:14:54] he said when I when I did he was in the
[1:14:56] ICU his son was choking on a seed what
[1:15:00] was that
[1:15:01] pistachio seed and he was it was it was
[1:15:04] just slowly draining and going down so
[1:15:06] he hadn't he didn't tell anybody he said
[1:15:08] he said burners right on time and I
[1:15:10] prayed for him over the phone and I
[1:15:11] prayed for his son the next morning the
[1:15:13] doctors when they took out this
[1:15:14] pistachio seed and he said it was right
[1:15:16] on time he needed a prayer he needed
[1:15:19] faith you need to you need to be up you
[1:15:21] need his faith to be risen and that's
[1:15:23] what it is we had we have to pray and
[1:15:25] start our day in the Word of God right
[1:15:27] being led by the Holy Spirit and then
[1:15:29] you know church when God's putting
[1:15:32] somebody on your heart you should know
[1:15:33] if I'm if I'm living right and if I'm
[1:15:35] living pure you should know the reason
[1:15:38] God put somebody on your heart is so you
[1:15:39] can reach out and pray for them praise
[1:15:41] God
[1:15:42] reach out and talk to them reach out and
[1:15:44] text them and that was a great lesson
[1:15:46] for me a nice renewal of that if I'm
[1:15:49] walking the Holy Spirit and I've got on
[1:15:51] the full armor of God and somebody is on
[1:15:54] my heart by the Holy Spirit I should
[1:15:56] reach out to them praise God you know in
[1:16:00] the past there was a couple people from
[1:16:01] our church that I would I would check in
[1:16:03] on them every time and they would say
[1:16:05] wow that was just the right time to
[1:16:07] check on because there are certain
[1:16:09] battles they were going through and
[1:16:11] that's a great example of that where we
[1:16:13] can have our feet shod with the
[1:16:16] preparation of the gospel of peace
[1:16:18] there's a friend I saw on I saw a
[1:16:21] reminder come up on Facebook a few years
[1:16:23] ago there's a friend from my hometown he
[1:16:25] was out of a job and he had no food and
[1:16:29] he said he sent me a Texas had pray for
[1:16:32] me his name's Scott he said pray for me
[1:16:34] so I prayed I said God in Jesus name
[1:16:37] will you help him to get some food give
[1:16:39] him a job or something he said the next
[1:16:41] hour somebody came by his door and said
[1:16:44] are you hungry do you need food an hour
[1:16:46] after I prayed for him his name's Scott
[1:16:49] Marr he wasn't from high school we were
[1:16:51] high school buddies you know things
[1:16:52] that's a couple years ago but it's a
[1:16:54] great reminder that I just dropped
[1:16:56] everything I did I just prayed for them
[1:16:59] and plead I just what I do is I normally
[1:17:00] push back my keyboard I just lift my
[1:17:02] hands and I say God please Jesus help
[1:17:05] that person and that time our feet was
[1:17:09] prepped was prepared praise God and God
[1:17:11] sent somebody across the state to give
[1:17:14] him food that he needed praise God so
[1:17:17] see just being prepared at any time go
[1:17:19] anywhere do anything just stop what
[1:17:21] you're doing and pray right there
[1:17:23] praise God always being ready your daily
[1:17:26] travels and your daily decisions are
[1:17:28] made in prayer and then you're ready to
[1:17:31] do what God has called you to do hey man
[1:17:34] uh I just I got the joy the Lord Church
[1:17:37] that's all I laugh like that I don't
[1:17:39] laugh like that because the gospel is
[1:17:40] funny I left like that cuz I'm happy
[1:17:42] praise God that's how I show my
[1:17:44] happiness hey I know it's like to be a
[1:17:47] sinner and I'm a saint now praise God
[1:17:49] these things make me happy these things
[1:17:51] make me rejoice and the Bible said
[1:17:53] rejoice always and again I say rejoice
[1:17:55] hey how do you praise God people think I
[1:17:59] laugh because it's funny it's not funny
[1:18:00] it's not rejoicing praise God I'm trying
[1:18:03] to contain it how they know yeah thank
[1:18:05] the Lord
[1:18:09] shield this is why I said earlier you
[1:18:11] and I can protect other people through
[1:18:13] our faith I saw brother Samuel preached
[1:18:17] on the shoot of faith recently and he
[1:18:20] showed her a historical thing where the
[1:18:22] shields of the Roman soldiers were acted
[1:18:23] as tall as they were so that way they
[1:18:27] could stand behind it but also they
[1:18:29] could lean down and it would protect all
[1:18:31] of them the shields were so large that
[1:18:34] they weren't just protecting themselves
[1:18:36] they were protecting people behind them
[1:18:38] as well so there's some of their not all
[1:18:41] their shields but many of their shields
[1:18:43] were so big but remember the Bible says
[1:18:45] that God is your shield praise God
[1:18:48] amen but Paul says your shield it
[1:18:51] represents God's anointing for true or
[1:18:54] I'm sorry faith shield of faith so it's
[1:18:57] God is our faith right God is our
[1:18:59] revelation God's Word is what we know
[1:19:02] it's our revelation praise God amen
[1:19:04] glory
[1:19:06] so just as a soldier shield protects all
[1:19:10] their other pieces I look at that it
[1:19:12] protects all the other ones your
[1:19:15] revelation protects every other part
[1:19:18] right I've got a revelation that Jesus
[1:19:21] died for me that does protect your your
[1:19:22] helmet - it does protect your it does
[1:19:25] protect your belt and and your and your
[1:19:28] agrees right your breastplate that's why
[1:19:32] it's so important to have a revelation
[1:19:34] about God's Word praise God that's why
[1:19:37] it's so important have a revelation of
[1:19:39] God's prophet because then when all
[1:19:41] these other attacks come you're
[1:19:43] protected because you've got a
[1:19:44] revelation praise God you can stand
[1:19:46] behind that and it won't hurt the rest
[1:19:49] of your life praise God because you can
[1:19:52] just say I know what thus saith the LORD
[1:19:54] is so when they shoot at me for they a
[1:19:56] man with trinitarian darts I can just
[1:19:58] stand there and I got the revelation
[1:19:59] that God's one person praise God that
[1:20:01] don't affect me it doesn't it doesn't
[1:20:04] bother me or does it there's a stumble
[1:20:05] meter because I got the revelation of
[1:20:08] thus saith the LORD just as a
[1:20:15] protects all the other pieces of armor
[1:20:17] so faith in Christ protects all the rest
[1:20:21] of your armor it extinguishes and
[1:20:23] stifles every falsehood Satan shoots
[1:20:27] from the bow of his lying tongue right
[1:20:31] because the Bible does say in Jeremiah
[1:20:34] that Satan has a bow and he shoots right
[1:20:36] and then says it in Revelation 60 with
[1:20:38] the white horse rider he's got a bow but
[1:20:40] no arrows cuz he he shot his lie but the
[1:20:42] church overcame it praise God amen
[1:20:45] I do yeah the church overcame the lies
[1:20:49] thank the Lord so church any with any
[1:20:53] attack think of any attack you might
[1:20:56] have that's why brother man said you got
[1:20:58] to pray for revelation more than
[1:21:00] anything whatever you're struggling with
[1:21:01] whether it's you know money or lust or
[1:21:04] greed or fear say God give me a
[1:21:06] revelation so I don't lust after that

[1:21:18] praise the Lord open up the Bible read
[1:21:20] the Bible and God will give us a
[1:21:22] revelation that we can hide behind and
[1:21:24] they'll protect us and it wipes away all
[1:21:26] the mind battles amen say God give me a

[1:24:28] what your shield of faith is when you

[1:24:31] revelation you know God had me marry
[1:24:33] this person God had me had these
[1:24:34] children when you got a revelation on

[1:25:02] just knocks off all the darts praise God
[1:25:05] now the last one the sword of the Spirit
[1:25:08] a soldier sword is their main offensive
[1:25:13] and lethal weapon just like that the
[1:25:17] Word of God spoken through a Christians
[1:25:19] mouth will resist the devil the Bible
[1:25:22] says will wound the devil and the Bible
[1:25:24] says will bruise the devil amen
[1:25:27] hallelujah eventually putting that demon
[1:25:32] to flight that's what about Jesus had to
[1:25:35] resist him three times so you struck
[1:25:38] woods let him he said it's written again
[1:25:40] struck twice he said it's written also
[1:25:43] and then finally he left but he had to
[1:25:46] keep fighting with the word here's what
[1:25:48] the Bible says here's the Bible says my
[1:25:50] God is Jehovah Jireh and that's shouting
[1:25:52] but you got to confess it out of your
[1:25:54] mouth the Bible says the word is nigh
[1:25:57] thee even in your mouth praise God the
[1:26:00] trouble I see in my life I'm sure your
[1:26:02] life too is we just get a spot we stop
[1:26:04] speaking God's word then we wonder where
[1:26:06] is the power and there's power of life
[1:26:08] in the tongue I think I'm gonna preach
[1:26:11] on that this week Kings I've been really
[1:26:12] enjoying that thought lately there's
[1:26:13] power of life and death in the tongue I
[1:26:16] am a forgiving child of God I believe
[1:26:18] I'm born again and the more the longer I
[1:26:22] live sister Naomi the more I believe I'm
[1:26:23] born again because I look at so many
[1:26:25] people's lives that say they're born
[1:26:26] again and they're not living the way
[1:26:28] Christ said to live in simple things I'm
[1:26:30] not talking to eat mysteries or things
[1:26:32] yeah I'm just talking simple
[1:26:34] things right with like for example like
[1:26:37] on Facebook laughing at cussing on
[1:26:38] Facebook when they put cuz it means I
[1:26:40] have custody people laugh at that and
[1:26:41] enjoy that just simple things like that
[1:26:44] or watching TV or bring your Netflix in
[1:26:46] your house and watching dirty shows you
[1:26:48] shouldn't be watching it's just simple
[1:26:50] things the Bible said avoid all
[1:26:52] appearance of evil praise God that's the
[1:26:55] revelation of the shield I got I'm not
[1:26:57] going to let that in because I've got a
[1:26:58] revelation I understand from all of
[1:27:01] Satan's darts praise God but if you keep
[1:27:07] speaking when I keep speaking God's Word
[1:27:09] we resist wound bruised and eventually
[1:27:12] put him to flight and then we can have a
[1:27:14] vacation time Jesus enjoy Satan left him
[1:27:17] for a season praise God
[1:27:19] they'll be harder seasons than others
[1:27:22] right but everything works together for
[1:27:24] God's good he makes everything beautiful
[1:27:26] in his own time hallelujah there will be
[1:27:32] seasons when your battles are less how
[1:27:34] many ever been through those thank the
[1:27:36] Lord for those praise God and remember
[1:27:47] the great pictures that Armageddon Jesus
[1:27:49] Christ all them all that listen all the
[1:27:52] men are gathered against him and what
[1:27:54] comes out of his mouth a sword of all
[1:27:58] the things that we could see a sword
[1:28:00] comes out of his mouth and the sword
[1:28:03] goes down and burns them all up don't
[1:28:05] forget this search these rich men that
[1:28:07] think they're so great now the Bible
[1:28:09] said brother bang they're gonna go hide
[1:28:10] in the caves and say rocks fall on us
[1:28:12] they might not be afraid of Christ now
[1:28:15] but they'll be afraid of Christ later I
[1:28:16] don't care how much money they got I
[1:28:19] think there's even videos on YouTube
[1:28:20] where they make their own caves on the
[1:28:21] ground that's probably part of it
[1:28:23] anything they can hide away but the
[1:28:26] cording to God's Word they'll be crying
[1:28:27] in there to say oh I want to die I don't
[1:28:30] want to face him the church what a
[1:28:31] blessing we have we want to see his face
[1:28:33] amen
[1:28:34] we want to live and we don't want the
[1:28:36] things of the world we don't want the
[1:28:38] pleasures of this life we want the
[1:28:40] pleasures of eternity praise God we want
[1:28:42] to see is that I want to see Jesus
[1:28:45] why because I served them my life and I
[1:28:47] wasn't worshiping I want to deal with
[1:28:49] them forever praise God hallelujah but
[1:28:53] these same rich man I think they're so
[1:28:54] rich they got everything they all
[1:28:56] figured out they're gonna live forever
[1:28:57] they're not gonna live forever they're
[1:29:00] gonna mention be hiding away from Christ
[1:29:02] but I don't want to hide from him I
[1:29:04] wanna hide in him you'll do one of the
[1:29:08] other church we're doing one of the
[1:29:10] other we're gonna hide away from him
[1:29:12] we're gonna hide with him praise God I
[1:29:15] want to hide in Christ that's right and
[1:29:20] every time you quote the word you're
[1:29:21] doing that every time you obey God's
[1:29:23] Word
[1:29:24] you are hiding in the protection of
[1:29:26] God's Word same thing for my life same
[1:29:30] thing for your life we're hiding in
[1:29:32] God's power and protection now let me
[1:29:36] finish this chapter let's almost done
[1:29:37] here but man said wave it in your hand
[1:29:42] wave that sword in your hand just wave
[1:29:45] it at the devil devil you better stop
[1:29:46] right there you better leave me it's
[1:29:50] written I'm a child of God there's no
[1:29:53] condemnation to me I'm in Christ Jesus
[1:29:56] I'm not living by my righteousness I'm
[1:29:58] living by Christ's righteousness right
[1:30:02] hallelujah I've got it I got the spirit
[1:30:04] of power love and a sound mind amen
[1:30:08] just quote it to him now let's finish up
[1:30:13] here this is that good to rehearse those
[1:30:16] things I think it's so important because
[1:30:18] we always grow in revelation and
[1:30:20] understanding of God and look at this as
[1:30:23] we close here Paul has just said you but
[1:30:26] you need to be a soldier and now he
[1:30:29] starts he's writing his letter this is
[1:30:31] the last time he's gonna contact these
[1:30:33] Ephesians this is the last letter to the
[1:30:35] Ephesians he's in prison he's gonna die
[1:30:38] in a few short years I believe this was
[1:30:40] written in 54 he died in 56 within 2
[1:30:42] years he'll be dead and off the scene
[1:30:44] the last thing he says are recorded here
[1:30:47] at the end of this chapter after he says
[1:30:49] make sure you put on the whole armor of
[1:30:51] God so let's read let's go to Ephesians
[1:30:55] let's look at
[1:30:56] would what would be a profits last words
[1:30:59] I think it's so beautiful and what are
[1:31:07] his desires knowing the Holy Spirit said
[1:31:10] you've got to go to Jerusalem you've got
[1:31:12] to give your life you're going to die
[1:31:14] what are some of his last wishes as a
[1:31:16] Christian prophet now before we get
[1:31:20] there verse 18 here's what I said
[1:31:21] earlier to put on our all the armor of
[1:31:23] God he said pray always so Saints as
[1:31:26] long as we're meditating in prayer we
[1:31:29] will have on the armor of God verse 18
[1:31:31] praying always with all prayer and
[1:31:33] supplication in the spirit and watching
[1:31:35] thereunto with all perseverance and
[1:31:37] supplication for All Saints now look now
[1:31:41] do you catch that all prayers whether
[1:31:42] amen sometime you can say a long
[1:31:44] 30-minute prayer
[1:31:46] other times bang I can just say a
[1:31:48] 1-minute prayer and I've had got to
[1:31:50] answer those other times I can pray
[1:31:53] while I'm singing and worshiping and
[1:31:55] it's a different kind of a prayer but
[1:31:57] you pray with all prayers at all time
[1:32:00] all the time you pray throughout the day
[1:32:02] and when you do that you have you're
[1:32:04] putting the armor of God on you're
[1:32:06] hiding behind God's word this is the
[1:32:08] shield of faith you see that so it's
[1:32:10] through prayers through communing with
[1:32:11] God talking with God praising his name
[1:32:14] not praising the devil but praising God
[1:32:17] see where I'd be careful oh the devil
[1:32:19] he's so strong oh the devil he's so sly
[1:32:21] let's not praise him right we know he
[1:32:24] slide we know he's slick but we know
[1:32:26] Christ is greater than Satan praise God
[1:32:29] he created him praise God
[1:32:32] well let's praise the Lord he said pray

[1:33:02] watching and keeping your sword ready to
[1:33:05] fight the devil
[1:33:08] verse 19 let's finish 19 to 24 what are
[1:33:12] this prophets last wishes if you could
[1:33:16] write somebody one last letter what
[1:33:18] would the last words you write be this
[1:33:22] beautiful 18 to 20 I'm sorry 19 to 20
[1:33:25] and for me so you see he said pray for
[1:33:28] all the things we said don't forget to
[1:33:30] pray for me I like that phrase gun he's
[1:33:35] in prison we said pray for everybody
[1:33:36] pray for me to that what do you pray for
[1:33:40] for do you pray for riches do you pray
[1:33:44] for a longer life here's what he prayed
[1:33:47] for by the bank that utterance may be
[1:33:50] given unto me hallelujah that I may open
[1:33:55] my mouth boldly to make known the
[1:33:59] mystery of the gospel for which I am an
[1:34:02] ambassador in bonds so see that's what
[1:34:04] he's saying right now I'm in Chains
[1:34:05] right now I'm in prison right now that
[1:34:09] there and I might speak boldly as I
[1:34:11] ought to speak Church what a picture
[1:34:13] what if can you picture Paul he's
[1:34:15] sitting out of chair he's got chains on
[1:34:17] and he's riding this they said you are
[1:34:19] armed you were fully other soldiers of
[1:34:21] God stand strong in Ephesus and pray for
[1:34:23] me that I can be more bold in prison you
[1:34:27] know could you just go about prison life
[1:34:29] you know you sit up you stand up I'm
[1:34:31] really sore now you gotta sit down
[1:34:32] you're sore
[1:34:33] ah and he would lose his boldness
[1:34:36] there's times you know he interact with
[1:34:39] the soldiers and he wouldn't be as bold
[1:34:42] and Paul said just pray for me not that
[1:34:45] I can live a longer life or have a
[1:34:46] bigger house or things like this he said
[1:34:49] but pray for me that I can be more bold
[1:34:51] with the gospel praise God he's gonna be
[1:34:54] dying in a couple of years yeah
[1:34:57] what would your prayer be now I'd say
[1:35:01] brother bang pray for me I'd get out of
[1:35:02] jail please pray for me but see Paul had
[1:35:07] he had prophecy to that he had to go to
[1:35:09] Rome he had prophecy I know I've got to
[1:35:12] give my life he says that Christ might
[1:35:14] be magnified in my death praise God
[1:35:17] because remember Jesus said I've got to
[1:35:19] show Paul how much he must suffer for my
[1:35:22] name
[1:35:22] sake praise God because he persecuted
[1:35:25] the Church of God so Jesus said you're
[1:35:27] gonna have to suffer you're going to be
[1:35:30] persecuted and then Jesus said then Paul
[1:35:32] then you'll know me in the power of my
[1:35:34] resurrection and the Fellowship of my
[1:35:37] sufferings oh god he's all chained up he
[1:35:43] said just pray for me sister Lydia just
[1:35:46] pray for me that one thing I'll be bold
[1:35:48] and I won't be so shy with the gospel
[1:35:51] what a prayer what a prayer help me to
[1:35:56] be bold because that's the reason I am
[1:35:59] chained up is because I've been
[1:36:00] preaching the gospel and the Jews hate
[1:36:02] me and they got they put me in jail pray
[1:36:07] for me that I can speak the mystery of
[1:36:09] the gospel of Christ now just to remind
[1:36:12] you there's 12 mysteries and Paul wrote
[1:36:15] about 9 of them he was so full of
[1:36:19] revelation yet he was imprisoned look at
[1:36:22] this he had he had most of the mysteries
[1:36:25] he wrote up he's the one that wrote them
[1:36:28] Jesus showed in the mysteries in Arabia
[1:36:30] like Simon said he digged out and then
[1:36:32] he wrote all the mysteries to Romans and
[1:36:34] Corinthians and he wrote all these
[1:36:35] ministries and so he's a man with all
[1:36:38] this revelation of mysteries and on his
[1:36:40] only prayers I just want to share what
[1:36:42] you've revealed to me just pray for me
[1:36:45] Saints that I can just share I can be
[1:36:48] more bold with the mystery of Christ
[1:36:50] that he's already revealed to me all he
[1:36:56] wanted was for a chance to share it with
[1:36:58] one person
[1:36:59] how many can say amen to that that's all
[1:37:02] it's my greatest desire sister Naomi
[1:37:04] when I go to work her you know I don't
[1:37:05] go to work now but when I used to God
[1:37:06] just sent me someone I can share the
[1:37:08] message with that is the greatest desire
[1:37:11] of my heart someone who actually wants
[1:37:13] to listen and once they hear what can
[1:37:16] God still heal is God this God is the
[1:37:19] same yesterday today in forever
[1:37:20] what does the Bible mean with the
[1:37:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost what is which
[1:37:25] way is the right way to be baptized my
[1:37:26] heart jumps every time somebody asked me
[1:37:29] that like wow huh what I can be bold now
[1:37:32] because you've asked me
[1:37:34] that's what Paul says
[1:37:36] pray for me that I'll be bold that I can
[1:37:40] speak the mystery of God with boldness
[1:37:42] that was his prayer as he getting ready
[1:37:45] to die within a couple years he'd be off
[1:37:47] the scene a member of the twelve
[1:37:52] mysteries Israel's blindness that means
[1:37:53] Israel can be saved even if they're
[1:37:55] blind they can still be saved because
[1:37:57] they'll go under the altar in heaven as
[1:37:59] long as they're faithful blinded Jews
[1:38:01] God will give them eternal life praise
[1:38:03] God because he had to blind them to save
[1:38:05] the Gentiles praise God
[1:38:07] Paul want to share this yeah I must go I
[1:38:12] gotta go through faster this is goes too
[1:38:13] slow I didn't have at least I got these
[1:38:15] illustrations or these things the
[1:38:17] rapture was a revelation a mystery like
[1:38:20] we've been preaching on the Jews and
[1:38:22] Gentiles are one body now Church
[1:38:24] it's about opposite for us today this is
[1:38:25] the chapter I started yesterday riding
[1:38:27] on this one the mystery was how could
[1:38:29] God let sinful Gentiles they're so evil
[1:38:32] and unholy they eat pigs and all these
[1:38:35] how could God let them into our church
[1:38:37] and that's what God was saying God was
[1:38:40] saying it's not about your holiness it's
[1:38:41] about my holiness praise God and God is
[1:38:45] like God is bringing how could the
[1:38:46] Gentiles come in but now we're like the
[1:38:48] opposite mm like how can the Jews get
[1:38:51] into this oh nice it's so interesting
[1:38:55] it's almost opposite now but the
[1:38:57] revelation is still the same and it
[1:39:00] allows Christians that have Liberty
[1:39:03] right some Christians can celebrate you
[1:39:06] know the Feast of the trumpets and they
[1:39:08] can celebrate the feast of weeks and the
[1:39:10] feasts of Passover that don't stumble
[1:39:11] anybody like if a Holy Ghost feel
[1:39:14] Christian once they go and eat Passover
[1:39:16] on this Thursday night or whatever let
[1:39:18] them do it you know if they want to go
[1:39:21] have you know and dance the Jewish music
[1:39:23] that's fine because the the Holy Ghost
[1:39:25] gives us Liberty within our Christian
[1:39:29] lives to do those things you say prove
[1:39:32] it absolutely Paul kept vows remember
[1:39:34] Paul kept Jewish busts and he said I'm
[1:39:36] going down to Jerusalem so I can pay my
[1:39:38] vow and he was the messenger of the
[1:39:41] gospel he said I want to go down and I
[1:39:44] want to observe Passover in Jerusalem
[1:39:46] that was one of Paul's goals before he
[1:39:48] got arrested which he was able to do
[1:39:50] boss that means Paul let his hair grow
[1:39:52] for a while they say I'm gonna keep my
[1:39:54] my vow and I'm gonna pay my vow there
[1:39:56] Jerusalem
[1:39:58] Paul said some people consider this day
[1:40:00] a holy day and this day's holder than
[1:40:02] that day
[1:40:03] Paul said that's fine just have your
[1:40:04] Liberty he said just don't condemn
[1:40:06] people that's right so God is so great
[1:40:10] the mysteries God can bring people from
[1:40:12] different backgrounds and cultures amen
[1:40:14] different skin colors and cultures and
[1:40:16] bring them all together give them the
[1:40:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost and they can
[1:40:20] exist peacefully and lovingly within
[1:40:23] their convictions and God sees laws one
[1:40:25] great sweet happy family praise God hey
[1:40:28] man I know it's a ministry you just
[1:40:31] wanted to share it with somebody just
[1:40:33] make me bold so I can share with one of
[1:40:35] these prison guards or somebody can
[1:40:36] visit me in prisons I can share with
[1:40:38] them the New Testament church as the
[1:40:41] Bride of Christ the Godhead amen
[1:40:44] godliness restored demands that your
[1:40:46] perfect man iniquity the Antichrist and
[1:40:50] the spirit of the Antichrist the seven
[1:40:53] stars in the hand the seven preachers
[1:40:55] write to the seven churches oh my
[1:40:57] Babylon Mystery Babylon Roman Catholic
[1:41:00] Church the will of God the kingdom of
[1:41:02] heaven and Christ in you the hope of
[1:41:05] glory praise God Paul all chained up he
[1:41:13] said all I want just pray for me that I
[1:41:15] can share I have all these mysteries you
[1:41:17] ever feel like that I feel like you're
[1:41:19] to blame I'm like I'm gonna explode
[1:41:20] sometimes like I feel like when I'm
[1:41:22] talking to people just ask me what I
[1:41:23] believe ask me just ask me he just
[1:41:27] didn't want to be wimpy with it is that
[1:41:28] how you feel that's how I feel I just
[1:41:31] don't want to be a wimp each like a shy
[1:41:32] Christian I want to be more bold but see
[1:41:34] I can't do it unless it's God's word for
[1:41:36] the mystery of God glory verse 21 that
[1:41:42] ye may also know my affairs and how I do
[1:41:46] ticki is a beloved brother and faithful
[1:41:49] minister and the Lord shall make known
[1:41:50] to you all things
[1:41:52] so these Ephesians they want to know how
[1:41:55] does Paul run the affairs of his life
[1:41:57] how does Paul do his finances how does
[1:42:00] Paul a witness how does Paul
[1:42:03] do church they want to know his affairs
[1:42:06] how's his trial going so Paul said I'm
[1:42:10] gonna let tickets know he's a faithful
[1:42:12] preacher I'm let him know my affairs and
[1:42:15] he's gonna share him with you right Paul
[1:42:20] wanted the Saints to know his affairs
[1:42:22] this means his practices undertaking
[1:42:24] what is Paul trying to do how is he
[1:42:26] grown closer to the Lord what's his
[1:42:28] behavior like in jail yes
[1:42:31] as we said his lawsuits you know he's
[1:42:33] he's on trial they want to know what was
[1:42:36] Paul's practice like how did he behave
[1:42:38] every day and that's what this message
[1:42:40] did for us pray I'm gonna Jose
[1:42:41] that's like God that loud ready to start
[1:42:43] taking those tapes in 1947 Ray's God
[1:42:46] amen
[1:42:47] so we can know how does the Prophet act
[1:42:49] like amen what is a practice of a
[1:42:51] prophet amen what is his life like
[1:42:54] Hansie handles affairs he hung with
[1:42:57] himself to the IRS right he paid that
[1:43:00] $40,000 now it's through a millionaire
[1:43:02] that God sent him brother Dow a
[1:43:04] millionaire see God provides for all of
[1:43:06] our needs praise God Satan sent a trap
[1:43:09] I'm gonna get you on those taxes and so
[1:43:11] God said imma send a millionaire in a
[1:43:12] church to pay the bill for him hey man
[1:43:15] any battle church for two or three years
[1:43:17] on that till God sent that millionaire
[1:43:19] in there so you'd go to be the scourge
[1:43:21] he was doing the right thing - he was in
[1:43:24] the right thing given all the money to
[1:43:25] the ministry he had a struggle for years
[1:43:28] he lied to the IRS he he fell short Lord
[1:43:31] out but God had all ordained it to give
[1:43:34] him a way out in the hour of temptation
[1:43:37] praise God God gave him a way out
[1:43:39] I'll send an old 90 year old man there
[1:43:41] I'll heal him I'll give him a thus saith
[1:43:43] the Lord and then his money still to
[1:43:45] this day is paying for that school in
[1:43:47] Lima
[1:43:47] it's called Bible believers school his
[1:43:49] money his investments of that brother
[1:43:51] Dow is continuing the Bride of Christ
[1:43:53] today that's how God wants to use money
[1:43:57] right it's not the big build big
[1:43:59] buildings it's not a big building very
[1:44:01] small but they keep investing it every
[1:44:03] year and they live off the interest and
[1:44:04] it keeps those children in a safe spot
[1:44:07] where they're out from the public school
[1:44:08] though there are some good public
[1:44:09] schools out there right sister Naomi we
[1:44:10] know I got a good school we can worship
[1:44:13] Jesus there but there's some evil ones
[1:44:15] and so God
[1:44:16] raise up that brother to have all those
[1:44:19] funds to help his prophet get off the
[1:44:22] IRS but also to train the next
[1:44:24] generations oh god is so wise Church God
[1:44:30] is so wise hallelujah
[1:44:33] this is why brother Branham had all
[1:44:35] these tapes recorded so we could know
[1:44:38] how does the Prophet act when he's in
[1:44:40] pressure how does the Prophet act when
[1:44:42] he's outnumbered with ministers how does
[1:44:45] a prophet prophet act when he's
[1:44:47] surrounded by a deadly bull or kill
[1:44:49] Hermes they praise God amen how does he
[1:44:52] act when he neat when he's a lot of
[1:44:55] pressure how does he act he goes out and
[1:44:57] spends time with the Lord he says honey
[1:44:59] I'm going the prayer closet so I can
[1:45:00] pray to the Lord how is he accurate his
[1:45:03] family's out of control
[1:45:04] I'll go over and wash dishes see he
[1:45:09] shows us his practices makes known their
[1:45:13] affairs and that gives us a lot of
[1:45:15] wisdom on how we should do our affairs
[1:45:19] remember these Ephesians knew Paul
[1:45:22] better than anybody else cuz he was
[1:45:23] there at least three years because he
[1:45:25] said I've warned you with tears for
[1:45:27] three years that wolves are gonna come
[1:45:28] in not sparing the flock so nobody knew
[1:45:32] Paul better and Paul said pray for me
[1:45:33] that I can be bold and I can share this
[1:45:35] message really boldly he said I'm
[1:45:39] sending tickets to show you how I live
[1:45:43] my life that you'll know how to conduct
[1:45:45] your life it sounds like the Christians
[1:45:52] neither the same help we need we need
[1:45:53] comfort look at ya the Cayennes it
[1:45:55] here's his last words before he dies now
[1:45:58] this is to the Ephesians not him he had
[1:46:00] other books like second Timothy was
[1:46:02] actually his last letter but this is
[1:46:03] these are the last words he'd say to the
[1:46:05] Ephesians whom I've set unto you for the
[1:46:08] same purpose that you might know my
[1:46:10] affairs and that he might comfort your
[1:46:12] hearts so you know you you know it would
[1:46:16] comfort them church to hear God's
[1:46:18] prophet is in jail but he's keeping the
[1:46:21] faith praise God he hasn't given up he
[1:46:24] hasn't cursed he's not defeated God's
[1:46:27] prophet is in jail but he wants your
[1:46:29] prayer so he can witness in the jail
[1:46:31] oh what a comfort amen to know that the
[1:46:35] ever abiding presence of Jesus Christ is
[1:46:39] so powerful that it he'll be with you in
[1:46:41] your house but be with you at the church
[1:46:43] he'll be with you in your darkest hour
[1:46:44] even if you're in a jail Jesus Christ
[1:46:47] spirit will be with you praise God hey
[1:46:49] man what a comfort he's not losing his
[1:46:53] hope because he's got God's Spirit he's
[1:46:55] sealed by the Holy Ghost down in a soul
[1:46:58] praise God see
[1:47:02] tickets will comfort your hearts and
[1:47:06] then verse 23 peace be to the Brethren
[1:47:09] what's the last thing you say may God
[1:47:11] fill you with his peace and love may God
[1:47:17] fill you with peace comfort love and
[1:47:20] faith are those things Paul could buy
[1:47:23] for them no these things have to come
[1:47:27] through Jesus Christ that all prayer all
[1:47:31] prayer and supplication you mentioned
[1:47:33] earlier all these things peace comfort
[1:47:35] love faith they all come from praying so
[1:47:37] what does Paul basically saying stay
[1:47:39] close to God through prayer right there
[1:47:42] yeah stay close to God the last thing I
[1:47:45] wish you is comfort peace love and faith
[1:47:48] if you'll pray God will give that to you
[1:47:54] from God the
[1:47:55] there and the Lord Jesus Christ from the
[1:47:59] invisible god the father to the visible
[1:48:01] son the image of the invisible God the
[1:48:04] Lord Jesus Christ I say into our feet
[1:48:06] grace be with all them that love and
[1:48:08] musicians can come that love our Lord
[1:48:10] Jesus Christ in all sincerity he said
[1:48:15] the last thing he says may you have
[1:48:17] sincerity that means purity Church so
[1:48:24] what's the last thing Paul says God give
[1:48:25] them peace love comfort faith and let
[1:48:30] them be sincere but then be pure from in
[1:48:34] corruption what would your last words be
[1:48:40] won't be the last words you would say if
[1:48:42] you were going off the scene these are
[1:48:46] the ones Paul cried with he said
[1:48:49] brothers come around here let's pray I
[1:48:50] know wolves are gonna come in let's pray
[1:48:51] for three years I've cried with you O
[1:48:54] God protect them from the wolves what
[1:48:56] would your last words be God give them
[1:48:58] peace God give them comfort give them
[1:49:01] faith and love and may the Grace and
[1:49:07] love of our Lord Jesus Christ be with
[1:49:08] you and may you be sincere how many want
[1:49:11] to be sincere today let's pray for that
[1:49:14] God just and sincerity means purity help
[1:49:18] us to be innocent right that also that
[1:49:21] means just confess our sins acknowledge
[1:49:23] we did wrong and say God help me to
[1:49:25] overcome that temptation next time the
[1:49:28] last words from a genuine vindicated
[1:49:32] prophet of god let's pray the same for
[1:49:34] us today by God's grace if you have need
[1:49:36] a special prayer I'll give you a chance
[1:49:38] to come up after this prayer but that's
[1:49:39] of our heads forward a prayer here
[1:49:42] Heavenly Father we've combed this
[1:49:44] scripture Lord God like your prophet
[1:49:46] said we preach scripture by scripture

[1:49:53] hide behind the shield of faith amen
[1:49:57] hide in Christ and watch and pray for
[1:50:02] other people that you can protect them
[1:50:04] hallelujah
[1:50:05] and pray for me that I'll be bold even
[1:50:10] as a locked up prisoner the Lord we see
[1:50:17] the heart of a prophet the things he
[1:50:19] wants for the Ephesians are peace
[1:50:20] comfort love and faith and sincerity
[1:50:26] Lord that's what I want I know that's
[1:50:28] what brother Branham wanted for us
[1:50:30] Peter wonder that for us unfeigned faith
[1:50:34] Peter said amen genuine faith nor the
[1:50:41] things I want for this church are things
[1:50:43] that I cannot buy we don't need a bigger
[1:50:47] church we don't need more money we need
[1:50:51] peace love faith comfort sincerity thank
[1:50:59] you Lord Father in Jesus Christ's name I

[1:51:59] Jesus Christ's name the church said
[1:52:01] anyone needs prayer more than welcome to
