[28:33] [Music]
[28:38] did you on the new this would be part
[28:45] six the kingdom of heaven part six it's
[28:51] a very fresh revelation to me that
[28:53] there's there's sixteen parables about
[28:56] the kingdom of heaven and it's a very
[28:58] fresh thought so I've been feasting on
[29:00] that and meditating on it for months and
[29:02] months now and now I feel kind of led to
[29:06] preach on I've been riding on it you're
[29:08] meditating on it and it's been a real
[29:12] blessing so I'd like to bring those
[29:13] thoughts by the grace of Lord tonight
[29:16] Matthew 13 verse 10 Matthew 13 10 we
[29:39] read verses 10 maybe down through 16 by
[29:50] God's grace Matthew 13 10 and the
[29:56] disciples came and said unto Him why
[29:57] speakest thou unto them in parables and
[30:00] he answered and said unto them because
[30:01] it is given unto you to know the
[30:04] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but
[30:06] to them it is not given now we looked at
[30:08] that on Sunday member and we saw that we
[30:14] have to understand the scripture
[30:15] carefully everybody got to hear the
[30:18] people got to hear it but this didn't
[30:20] mean Jesus wasn't offering it to them he
[30:22] was offering it to them but this means
[30:24] it wasn't meant to them because they
[30:26] rejected it right Jesus came to his own
[30:29] but his own received him not the juice
[30:32] and let his blood be upon us so the Jews
[30:35] got to hear it
[30:36] this means it wasn't predestinated for
[30:39] them because he knew they would reject
[30:41] it because God is loving God he's a fair
[30:46] God he's equitable he's
[30:49] he's just verse 12 for whosoever hath to
[30:53] him shall be given and he shall have
[30:54] more abundance but whosoever hath not
[30:57] from him shall be taken away even that
[30:59] he hath we saw that on Sunday how God
[31:02] took Judas's Judas Iscariot sold out
[31:05] Christ so God took his ministry and gave
[31:08] it to Matthias of course we know the
[31:11] Apostle Paul played a part in that as
[31:12] well but Matthias was a tremendous
[31:16] missionary and was a martyr crucified
[31:19] like Christ he was such a godly martyr
[31:23] verse 13 therefore speak I unto them in
[31:27] parables because seeing they see not so
[31:30] here this backs it up the Jews saw it
[31:32] but they didn't see it didn't understand
[31:35] it because he says that next and hearing
[31:37] they hear not neither do they understand
[31:39] and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of
[31:43] Esaias which saith by hearing ye shall
[31:46] hear and shall not understand and seeing
[31:50] ye shall see and shall not perceive for
[31:52] this people's heart is waxed gross so
[31:54] here's why they can't understand their
[31:57] heart is waxed gross and their ears are
[32:01] dull of hearing and their eyes they have
[32:03] closed see they've closed it on purpose
[32:06] they just didn't want to obey it lest at
[32:09] any time they should see with their eyes
[32:10] and hear with their ears and should
[32:12] understand with their heart so see their
[32:14] hearts were in love with worldly things
[32:16] can everybody understand that that's why
[32:19] they rejected Jesus they were in love
[32:20] with their money they were in love with
[32:22] their denomination more than they were
[32:24] in love with really with God
[32:27] and should be converted and I should
[32:29] heal them
[32:30] Amen may God as blessing the reading of
[32:32] his word may be seated like I said I'm
[32:36] gonna try to protect my voice here I
[32:38] usually shout and cry and scream and
[32:40] everything like that but I'm gonna try
[32:41] to control myself hopefully tonight by
[32:43] God's grace okay girls I'm gonna try to
[32:45] control myself I got out of control
[32:46] somebody just yell wave that because I
[32:48] don't want to go preaching and I don't
[32:51] have a no voice I want to if they
[32:54] invited me to come I want to have a
[32:56] voice to preach which I gave all my
[32:59] voice on Sunday to you all so praise the
[33:01] Lord it seemed like an America that's
[33:04] really all we got to give right now you
[33:05] know we don't have political pressure we
[33:07] don't have military pressure we don't
[33:10] have imprisonment you know we don't have
[33:14] to worry about that other countries do
[33:16] but our suffering is just really small
[33:19] and more my battles and battles with the
[33:22] cares of the world and the riches of
[33:24] this life and we've got to overcome that
[33:27] now let's look here you can switch over
[33:31] Lydia I got a few slides I want to show
[33:35] this has been like I said in inspiration
[33:39] to me on the kingdom of heaven I've been
[33:43] studying this since probably December
[33:45] maybe earlier and at first I thought
[33:50] there was only seven parables about the
[33:52] kingdom of heaven because you know I'd
[33:54] read Matthew chapter 13 and there are
[33:57] seven parables in Matthew chapter 13
[34:01] about the kingdom of heaven well I I for
[34:04] some reason I guess in my absence of
[34:06] mind I never thought to go read and
[34:09] search and see if there was any more
[34:12] parables about the kingdom of heaven so
[34:16] in July the Holy Spirit put a little
[34:19] thought of my heart and kind of asked me
[34:21] the question did you ever check if there
[34:24] was more parables about the kingdom of
[34:27] heaven and I went back I found nine more
[34:29] so what a surprise I didn't even have
[34:31] half of them when I went to look and
[34:33] that just shows you no man's effort and
[34:36] then God's correction of man so I was
[34:38] happy to be corrected by the Holy Spirit
[34:40] I always want to be happy to be
[34:42] corrected by the holy spirit so this is
[34:45] part six tonight
[34:47] we'll look at we looked at part four and
[34:48] five on Sunday hopefully that was a
[34:50] blessing on the parable of the talents
[34:52] and the pounds so remember there sixteen
[34:55] parables so I found this out through
[34:57] studying 16 parables I don't know the
[35:01] real definition of the number sixteen I
[35:03] know eight is eternity but sixteen is
[35:06] interesting because in the book of first
[35:09] Corinthians 13 there are sixteen
[35:11] attributes about charity you know it
[35:14] suffers long is kind does not boast is
[35:17] not prideful does not exalt itself does
[35:19] not puffed up there's 16 of those
[35:22] characteristics about charity and jesus
[35:26] said the kingdom of heaven with is
[35:27] within you which is the love of God or
[35:29] the baptism of the Holy Ghost so it's
[35:32] just interesting I feel like again I'm
[35:34] just scratching the surface you know of
[35:35] the number 16 but the themes we saw I'll
[35:40] list them here I put these in orange
[35:42] because I preached on these this weekend
[35:44] so I'm kind of done with those I may go
[35:46] back later you know or I'm sorry we will
[35:48] go back to those in the future and start
[35:50] praying and asking God to show us the
[35:53] gifts in our lives so we can be a help
[35:54] to one another
[35:56] alright so for example like when brother
[36:01] brother Jose was sick sometimes they'll
[36:03] call me or text me and ask me to pray
[36:05] and God has answered prayers for him at
[36:07] times there's other times like if you
[36:12] need someone maybe need a godly word of
[36:14] wisdom you want to contact someone with
[36:16] the word of wisdom right or if you know
[36:18] someone's had a dream and it's come to
[36:19] pass
[36:20] like Amen who have dreams that things
[36:22] I've gone through and it's come to pass
[36:24] and they've told me about the dream and
[36:26] the very scriptures in their dream was
[36:28] the ones I was thinking of and so that's
[36:33] not that's a channel we may be able to
[36:35] use in the future
[36:36] you know God kind of speaking and
[36:37] discerning so you know we would let's
[36:43] say if you had a need on your heart you
[36:44] might say you know brother amen could
[36:46] you pray for me and see if the Lord
[36:47] would give you a dream now I'm not make
[36:50] a
[36:51] make a gift make it operate but just see
[36:53] if God would use that chair because this
[36:56] in church how many know this that's what
[36:59] people did to brother Brandon all the
[37:00] time how many know that why did the
[37:02] people drive across the country why
[37:04] would they sleep in his yard people
[37:06] would camp out and sleep in his yard why
[37:08] would they do it so he could pray for
[37:09] them they could operate the gift right
[37:12] not to make an idol of brother branham
[37:14] but just to recognize that's a gift of
[37:16] God and if there's a genuine gift of God
[37:18] then we want to see if God will speak to
[37:21] us through that gift and if that's the
[37:23] leader leadership of God that could be a
[37:25] good thing right like why did they come
[37:29] to Peter they came to Peter and people
[37:30] got healed just by his shadow touching
[37:33] them it's because they knew he was a
[37:35] godly man and church when we live so
[37:38] close to God
[37:39] people will see Christ in our lives and
[37:41] they will start coming to us right
[37:43] they'll start coming to you as you live
[37:46] a more consecrated godly life and as God
[37:49] starts using your gifts people will come
[37:52] to you and God will use you praise the
[37:54] Lord I believe that so see it's it's
[37:58] it's not like it's not making an idol
[38:02] out of someone's gift but it's
[38:04] recognizing that God placed the gifts in
[38:06] this church for your benefit how many
[38:09] believe that I believe that follow my
[38:11] heart praise the Lord you know there was
[38:17] times I don't know what gift this is but
[38:21] there was times you know John Graham
[38:22] when he was here I would need help
[38:25] organizing things and I could go ask him
[38:27] and he would help me organize them he
[38:29] did agree he just had this gift to kind
[38:31] of or in a kind of a vision to see
[38:33] things and organize things and he helped
[38:35] me organize my life my finances even my
[38:39] well the way I set up my my studying my
[38:41] computers you know he just and that
[38:44] course that might not be a spiritual
[38:45] gift but it is some type of gift you
[38:48] know to be able to organize maybe it's
[38:49] wisdom there are this maybe it's wisdom
[38:50] maybe it's wisdom but he would be able
[38:53] to just kind of lay things out and and
[38:55] show it in a way that I hadn't seen it
[38:57] before and you know there's times that I
[39:01] needed I needed a knowledge about the
[39:04] Word of God
[39:04] and so there was times I would ask
[39:07] brother Brooks questions about the Word
[39:09] of God and and God would answer my
[39:11] question through brother Brooks because
[39:14] perhaps he had a gift of knowledge he
[39:17] could point me to the scripture and I
[39:20] didn't know especially early on when I
[39:21] wasn't hadn't been studying the Word of
[39:24] God very long and so we want to see
[39:27] where God has placed gifts in our lives
[39:30] so that we can be vessels for God to
[39:32] speak to other people praise God how
[39:36] many one how many want your testimony to
[39:37] be that I help people praise God that's
[39:40] what I want my life to be then I help
[39:43] well I didn't live a selfish life but I
[39:45] lived a life where Christ could use my
[39:47] gifts to glorify his great name and if I
[39:51] could and we know this church you know
[39:53] we talk about justification
[39:55] sanctification baptism Holy Ghost
[39:56] justification is getting you saved what
[39:59] sanctifies what sanctification
[40:01] sanctification is cleaning you out and
[40:03] setting you aside for service right so
[40:07] now you're set aside but the Holy Ghost
[40:09] is putting you into into service right
[40:14] so when you're sanctified now you're
[40:16] finally set apart now you're to place
[40:18] your your way far apart from your old
[40:20] habit your old lifestyles and just being
[40:22] a new Christian you are so now you're
[40:25] set apart and God can come over here and
[40:27] use you because now you're not close to
[40:29] dirty things you know your your way
[40:31] removed from that you're so far from
[40:33] that and your your godly is sanctified
[40:36] and God can pick you up and use you like
[40:38] a gold vessel praise God or like a
[40:40] silver vessel trust we trust by God's
[40:43] grace we're gold vessels amen we don't
[40:46] want to be on earth in our wood vessel
[40:47] because that was where out what they
[40:48] wrought out we want to be a gold silver
[40:51] we want to be a real vessel of God Gold
[40:54] really amen because gold represents
[40:57] deity in the scripture right because all
[41:00] the deity all the gold was in the Holies
[41:03] of Holies praise God amen now so we will
[41:07] go back to these I just wanted to share
[41:08] a few words about that that was a great
[41:10] blessing this has been a tremendous
[41:11] blessing for me these these parables and
[41:14] and and church one thing we got to
[41:17] remember we are
[41:18] God gave us something valuable don't let
[41:22] the devil ever tell you you're not
[41:24] valuable you're very valuable yeah God
[41:26] gave everybody something whether little
[41:28] or extremely great everybody has a great
[41:31] valuable gift from God so don't let the
[41:34] devil ever tell you well you don't have
[41:35] nothing no God gave everybody something
[41:37] the parable show everybody got some of
[41:40] Christ's money everybody got something
[41:43] divine from Christ it was straight from
[41:45] him amen praise God you've got something
[41:49] inside of you that was straight from
[41:50] heaven hallelujah and it's valuable it's
[41:54] special it's something the devil wants
[41:56] you to waste right the devil wants you
[41:58] to waste it the devil wants you to
[42:00] ignore but you can't bury in the earth
[42:02] you can't cover it over with excuses you
[42:04] can't cover it over a doubt or fear or
[42:06] anger or bitterness you've got to take
[42:09] all that off and you got to invest it in
[42:11] the father's business amen hallelujah so
[42:16] well we'll continue on those but I feel
[42:19] like I want to move on tonight out of
[42:21] the 16 two of them do a sin house in
[42:25] spreads and that will help us these will
[42:29] help us to overcome sin in the kingdom
[42:32] of heaven that's why they're there right
[42:35] now in both cases Church sin was a tiny
[42:39] mustard seed I got a bunch of mustard
[42:41] seed in my office it's such a tiny seed
[42:43] in both cases it's something either
[42:45] small or hidden see that sin is always
[42:48] small when it starts and it always seems
[42:51] to be hiding and that's a mystery see
[42:55] the kingdom of heaven reveals that right
[42:59] Satan's not gonna come in and show
[43:01] himself he's gonna come in real sly real
[43:04] small and we've got to have spiritual
[43:07] eyes to recognize it and that's why it's
[43:10] a mystery of the kingdom of God we need
[43:11] God to reveal to us our wisdom and
[43:15] everything now is so we can recognize
[43:16] Satan's tricks and then overcome it
[43:20] three of the parables deal with the Holy
[43:24] Ghost and the rapture in this one you
[43:27] have to have the the wedding garment
[43:28] without it you're not a part of the
[43:30] wedding
[43:31] so that represents the batson holy ghost
[43:33] the oil that the the five wise virgins
[43:36] had that represents the baptism holy
[43:38] ghost and I joke just look this one up
[43:40] earlier this is the parable where they
[43:44] make three excuses not to come to the
[43:46] wedding supper I gotta watch my field I
[43:49] gotta go check out my oxen and I gotta
[43:52] go I just married a wife you know they
[43:54] the money property and relationships
[43:58] there's all these excuses but the King
[44:00] gets upset he said fine
[44:02] he said go go get the MAME the halt in
[44:04] the blind they say there's still room he
[44:06] said fine go out one more time to compel
[44:08] them go out to the highways and hedges
[44:10] so we're in the age of compelling people
[44:13] that's why we that's why we'll do with
[44:15] that it will do anything we can to try
[44:17] to get people to come to Christ you'll
[44:19] do anything for them you'll invite them
[44:21] you'll pray for them how many people we
[44:22] prayed for to come to church you know
[44:24] I've given out almost 120 books now just
[44:28] try praying for people just to come to
[44:30] Christ to do anything you can do take
[44:32] the loss no matter what the money you
[44:33] lose doesn't matter God will provide
[44:35] amen God sees our sacrifice so see and
[44:40] so a Holy Ghost person will respond to
[44:44] the invitation and they'll come to the
[44:46] marriage supper because he said my room
[44:50] my feast will be full praise God how
[44:54] many have a reservation at that supper
[44:55] praise God Amen now there's five the
[45:00] deal with salvation so god of course
[45:03] he gives us grace for salvation treasure
[45:05] in the field the pearl gray price
[45:07] Labor's in the vineyard the unmerciful
[45:09] servant and the seed cast into the
[45:11] ground I guess you could make an
[45:14] argument this kind of deals with the
[45:16] baptism Holy Ghost I guess I may move
[45:18] that one we'll see because it deals with
[45:20] the three stages of wheat of a wheat
[45:22] grain or wheat plant rather now tonight
[45:26] I want look at these two by God's grace
[45:28] and I want look at these two I kinda
[45:31] already preached on that one I don't
[45:32] know if I'll deal with that one too much
[45:33] that one's really simple but it's it's
[45:38] for the this one's for those people it's
[45:40] for that that Jewish age at the
[45:41] beginning when there was that age of
[45:43] crossover between Jew to Christian
[45:45] juda Gentile that was an important that
[45:49] was a port in Revelation for those early
[45:51] Jews that were trying to understand well
[45:54] we're not under the law not under the
[45:56] curse of the law but we still feel
[45:58] convicted with the law and so what Paul
[46:01] says later is that when we have the holy
[46:04] spirit we live such an obedient life
[46:06] that we fulfill the righteous commands
[46:09] of the law from our hearts amen and
[46:12] we're not under the curse of the law
[46:14] because Jesus took our curse but now we
[46:17] happily obey the law because it's God's
[46:20] nature right God's unchanging so his
[46:22] godly nature from the Old Testament
[46:24] carries over to the new praise God and
[46:27] now that we've got the Holy Ghost we
[46:29] love to obey the Word of God our flesh
[46:31] hates it but our soul loves it amen
[46:34] praise God hallelujah
[46:37] yeah still find that I've been serving
[46:39] God almost twenty actually twenty years
[46:41] this year December will be twenty years
[46:43] I've been serving God and my flesh still
[46:45] hates to obey it sometimes but my soul
[46:48] loves it Ethan I always got to crucify
[46:51] this guy and all the things he thinks
[46:53] and once they do I just got to cast it
[46:55] down in Jesus name Amen
[46:57] now let's I got some quotes so I'll get
[47:00] to those in a little bit but I'll keep
[47:01] that up there for a moment now let's go
[47:03] right through this first parable tonight
[47:06] we're looking at let's look at the wheat
[47:08] and tares some of you it'll be a
[47:09] refreshing course you've already heard
[47:11] it before
[47:12] maybe the children it'll be new because
[47:13] I don't know how much I've taught my
[47:15] children on this one yet
[47:16] I've taught them a lot but I don't know
[47:18] if I've taught them this parable so they
[47:20] may deserve a chance to hear it too
[47:22] right praise God so Matthew 13:24 let's
[47:25] go there the wheat and the tares now in
[47:31] the next book I'm writing which I'm
[47:33] about 42% done almost halfway done I
[47:38] give a a simple one-line revelation for
[47:42] every parable so this is what I felt led
[47:45] to right here for the wheat and the
[47:47] tares the revelation is this every
[47:49] person is either a child of God or Satan
[47:52] and churches are full of them both until
[47:56] the time right before the rapture
[47:59] he's a member right before the rapture
[48:00] member what happened Jesus the King
[48:02] comes in he says oh you don't have a
[48:04] garment you've got to be dismissed never
[48:06] that phrase God and brother Branham
[48:09] calls that the squeeze or the time right
[48:11] before the rapture it's right before the
[48:13] laying down to the mark of the beast
[48:14] when the government's are gonna come
[48:16] against Christianity and it's gonna come
[48:18] through America because of Revelation 13
[48:21] America is the Beast out of the land so
[48:25] it has to be America it has to be us
[48:27] it's gonna be right here amongst us now
[48:29] doesn't that make it shouldn't make you
[48:31] scared it should make you feel good that
[48:33] God knew you could overcome the say the
[48:36] satanic influence in this government hey
[48:39] hey man now don't get me wrong I pray
[48:41] for Trump I pray for pence I pray for
[48:43] Congress I pray for the Supreme Court I
[48:46] pray for all those people but we know
[48:48] right before the rapture that Satan will
[48:51] use the politics in such a way he's
[48:53] gonna persecute Christians the same way
[48:56] they did in the Roman Roman Kingdom
[48:59] right and that's scriptural because the
[49:03] Bible said the Beast exercised the same
[49:06] power the Beast out of the land as the
[49:08] beast out of the sea and the Beast out
[49:10] of the sea was Imperial pagan Rome Nero
[49:13] Titus all those evil men that pursue the
[49:16] church the Bible said that same power is
[49:19] gonna speak in this United States beast
[49:21] out of the land and the church said this
[49:24] is not brother branham's idea it's not a
[49:26] man's idea it's the Word of God and so
[49:29] God thought so much of you he said ah
[49:31] I'll place Naomi in the United States
[49:33] cuz she'll overcome amen I've got
[49:36] confidence in Malachi Lydia because
[49:38] they'll overcome amen
[49:39] see a lot of countries you know they're
[49:42] good they go through hard times no doubt
[49:43] but we're coming down to the the ramstad
[49:45] members thus saith the Lord a
[49:47] persecution just like pagan Rome just
[49:50] like the Colosseum where the Christians
[49:52] were you know eaten by lions I don't
[49:55] know if it'll come to that it'll
[49:56] probably be guns here in America but the
[49:58] same spirit of persecution is coming to
[50:00] United States
[50:01] it's thus saith the Lord so we've got to
[50:03] be ready we got to be praying watching
[50:05] waiting for the coming of the Lord but
[50:06] we'll know he said you'll know the times
[50:08] in seasons amen thank God he pauses Paul
[50:12] said you know
[50:13] you'll know the times in seasons so the
[50:15] Holy Spirit will keep us in line with
[50:17] the word so that will recognize the time
[50:20] and season of the rapture
[50:22] hallelujah Matthew 13:24 Matthew 13:24
[50:35] well maybe we only get the way I'm going
[50:37] I don't know if I'll get to done with
[50:38] the first the first parable thank the
[50:41] Lord I know a lot of its review but just
[50:43] just keep enjoying it keep feeding on it
[50:46] and hopefully tonight Lord willing
[50:48] you'll see something maybe you never
[50:50] seen before hopefully tonight by God's
[50:52] grace Matthew 13:24 another parable put
[50:55] he forth on them saying the kingdom of
[50:57] heaven is likened unto a man which sowed
[51:00] good seed in his field but while men
[51:03] slept his enemy came and sowed tares
[51:07] among the wheat and went his way but
[51:11] when the blade was sprung up and brought
[51:13] forth fruit then appeared the tares also
[51:16] so the servants of the householder came
[51:18] and said to him Sir didst thou not sow
[51:21] good seed in thy field from whence then
[51:23] hath it tares and he said to them an
[51:26] enemy hath done this the servant said
[51:29] unto Him wilt thou then that we go and
[51:32] gather them up but he said nay lest
[51:34] while you gather up the tares ye root up
[51:36] also the wheat with them
[51:38] verse 24 and here's good good scripture
[51:41] here let both grow together until the
[51:45] harvest and in the time of harvest I
[51:47] will say to the Reapers gather ye
[51:49] together first the tares and bind them
[51:51] in bundles to burn them but gather the
[51:54] wheat into my barn now Christ interprets
[51:58] this parable and verse 36 so go to verse
[52:00] 36 then Jesus sent the multitude away
[52:03] and went into the house and his
[52:04] disciples came unto him saying declare
[52:06] unto us the parable of the tares of the
[52:08] field 37 he answered and said unto him
[52:11] he that soweth the good seed is the son
[52:13] of man the field is the world the good
[52:16] seed are the children of the kingdom but
[52:17] the tares are the children of the wicked
[52:19] one the enemy that sowed them is the
[52:21] devil the harvest is the end of the
[52:23] world and the Reapers are the Angels
[52:26] as therefore the tares are gathered and
[52:28] burned in the fire so shall it be in the
[52:30] end of this world so every see that
[52:34] that's why this is an end time
[52:36] conditions parable every see that Jesus
[52:38] is foretelling what the kingdom is gonna
[52:40] be like at the end of the world that's
[52:43] why this is an endtime parable the same
[52:45] thing he says about the net cast in the
[52:47] sea okay where was that okay yeah there
[52:52] were a verse yeah verse 41 the son of
[52:55] man shall send forth his angels and they
[52:57] shall gather out of his kingdom all
[52:58] things that offend and then they do
[53:00] iniquity and shall cast them into a
[53:02] furnace of fire there shall be weeping
[53:04] and gnashing of teeth then shall the
[53:08] righteous shine forth as the Sun in the
[53:10] kingdom of their father who hath ears to
[53:12] hear let him hear
[53:14] praise God now let's look at some of
[53:16] these thoughts here in this parable the
[53:20] good seed is not the word remember in
[53:23] the foregrounds the good seed was the
[53:25] word but now the seed is not the word
[53:28] now the seed is you and I seed
[53:32] represents it I guess you could say
[53:33] we're part of the word you know I guess
[53:35] you could say that but the foregrounds
[53:37] was the word seed falling on hearts and
[53:40] it was four different heart conditions
[53:42] but now the seeds are seed children of
[53:46] God that are planted in this earth
[53:48] praise God and Jesus teaches there'll be
[53:52] both wheat God's children and tares
[53:54] Satan's children in the world until the
[53:57] end time God's children you and I came
[54:00] from Jesus aren't you glad you were
[54:02] right there in his soul's pouch of all
[54:04] those seeds you came right out of the
[54:06] heart of God amen
[54:07] you were right there PAC I how do you
[54:11] where he said I want Jesse there I want
[54:13] Kristen there so they can get married
[54:14] and have a family
[54:15] I want the Saints and gone over there
[54:18] sister Beatrice and brother William and
[54:21] he just placed exactly where I'm farmers
[54:24] say they'll just go like this you know
[54:26] but God knew exactly where he was
[54:27] putting you he knew exactly where he put
[54:30] each one of us by the grace of the Lord
[54:32] so true but see they were sewn first the
[54:38] enemies Satan who came in
[54:40] afterwards and so tears or unbelievers
[54:42] at harvest time the end of the world the
[54:44] angels come and separate unbelievers for
[54:46] their fire judgement afterwards the
[54:49] righteous wheat shine forth as the Sun
[54:52] in the kingdom of their father now
[54:54] here's something you need to remember
[54:55] the timeline of this parable is the
[54:59] beginning of Jesus Christ's ministry so
[55:02] 8030 all the way till now or the end of
[55:06] the world whenever the rapture takes
[55:07] place that's the timeline and the reason
[55:10] is because the Son of Man does the
[55:13] planting right and the Son of Man is
[55:17] used over 80 times to describe Jesus
[55:19] Christ in the in the Gospels 80 times he
[55:22] always calls himself the Son of Man
[55:24] people call him a son a man he just
[55:26] keeps referring to himself as the Son of
[55:28] Man so the Son of Man was planting his
[55:30] children ordaining his children as their
[55:34] times and seasons right there at the
[55:36] beginnings and ministry that was Jesus's
[55:40] three-and-a-half year ministry now then
[55:46] the Bible said while men slept right so
[55:51] after Jesus three and a half year
[55:52] ministry he went to heaven and those
[55:54] early Saints started dying right and as
[55:58] they died then what did Satan who Satan
[56:00] came in and the Bible said corrupters or
[56:03] false liars and wolves entered into the
[56:06] flock I remember that from Acts chapter
[56:07] 20 Paul cried for three years saying
[56:10] wolves are gonna come in wolves are
[56:12] gonna come in they're gonna look like
[56:13] sheep but they're wolves remember that's
[56:15] three years he cried I can't even cry
[56:18] two days in a row let alone three years
[56:20] Paul cried for three years saying wolves
[56:23] are gonna come in and eat up the
[56:25] Ephesian Church beware watch out and
[56:29] that's when Satan was sowing his tears
[56:32] he was sending in wolves it was after
[56:35] men slept it was when men died right the
[56:37] Saint started dying and so after that
[56:40] now that both had sewn all their seeds
[56:41] now what grows up we in terror
[56:43] side-by-side now the church is
[56:45] intertwine right with wheat and tares
[56:48] first Jesus during his three and half
[56:50] year ministry plan the good seed the
[56:52] word of the saints the believers
[56:54] while after the men died Satan brought
[56:56] in his lying preachers the false
[56:59] preachers the false apostles Satan
[57:01] transformed himself as a servant of
[57:03] light the Bible says in sin Corinthians
[57:05] 11 and he started devouring the real
[57:08] church and pretty soon tears started
[57:11] taking over the field that's right
[57:14] that's scriptural now let me go the next
[57:16] thought here we'll see how far maybe
[57:19] we'll get pretty far by the grace of the
[57:21] Lord now tears you know our
[57:26] impersonators of wheat and they grow
[57:30] together to the human eye you can hardly
[57:33] distinguish a wheat from a tear they
[57:35] look so much alike the only way to know
[57:39] is as they get older and they get mature
[57:42] so we know there can be tears sitting in
[57:45] any Church and we've seen them
[57:46] especially in the last seven years since
[57:48] 2012 when the believe the sign movement
[57:52] really started taking steam people that
[57:56] would say they believe the Word of God
[57:58] before now they basically speak evil of
[58:01] Christians and see it proves they're the
[58:05] wrong see Church because Esau persecuted
[58:08] Jacob right see the false seed will
[58:12] always persecute the true seed is that
[58:14] right so see when these people started
[58:17] switching sides and now they start
[58:19] condemning brother Branham or they start
[58:21] condemning you or they start condemning
[58:23] anyone who obeys the symbol word of God
[58:25] it shows they're on the wrong side
[58:27] because they're persecuting the elect of
[58:30] God and bride will not persecute bride
[58:33] praise God
[58:34] we'll have troubles you don't have
[58:35] little problems in the church but
[58:37] nothing like that nothing persecuting
[58:40] nothing like blaspheming the Word of God
[58:42] and the revelations of this hour you
[58:45] won't have that amongst real bride
[58:47] members so see tears they look so much
[58:52] like it but at harvest time remember
[58:56] tears will not bow so real wheat vows
[58:59] are the other one they call it nods so
[59:01] so if you don't have a big shout amen
[59:03] hopefully got a nod tonight
[59:05] if you're not shouting name in hopefully
[59:07] you'll not say that's right brother
[59:08] that's right
[59:09] maybe you're tired and you just you
[59:11] can't shout Amen just not because the
[59:15] the tear cannot not delight of the son
[59:18] they just stand there and defy the Sun
[59:21] and if eaten you know tears cause
[59:24] vomiting right convulsions and that's
[59:27] why Jesus said I'll spew you out of my
[59:29] mouth right that's what I told the laity
[59:32] in church age and people can even die if
[59:34] they eat the tear kernels that's what
[59:37] science says and I showed the video
[59:40] years ago remember that I don't know it
[59:41] was some some women overseas when they
[59:44] harvest wheat they don't have combines
[59:46] they squat down like this and they they
[59:48] just take that that that a circular
[59:51] knife I forget what's called the C that
[59:53] might be called and they just cut
[59:55] handful after handful while they're
[59:56] sitting there once they got the handful
[59:58] they just can pick off the tears like
[59:59] that and they just throw them away like
[1:00:00] that there's because they're trained to
[1:00:02] it they can see which ones are bound and
[1:00:04] which ones are tame hen and the angels
[1:00:07] see Church the Angels know who's on
[1:00:08] God's side and who's not Amen when you
[1:00:11] bow to the word when you obey the word
[1:00:13] when you repent when you get blessed by
[1:00:15] the Holy Spirit and serve God with all
[1:00:17] your heart you better believe the angels
[1:00:19] are watching amen
[1:00:20] they know who's a real servant of God
[1:00:22] amen
[1:00:23] they know who loves the Lord the Angels
[1:00:26] be able to pick them out right away
[1:00:27] that's it unbeliever that's a that's a
[1:00:29] wolf that's a deceiver of men and jesus
[1:00:32] said you'll know them to by their fruits
[1:00:34] you shall know them we won't be deceived
[1:00:37] the true bride always stays with the
[1:00:40] true word amen hallelujah I'm trying not
[1:00:43] to scream amen
[1:00:44] trying to keep my voice under control
[1:00:46] it's a different feeling it really is I
[1:00:49] can just usually lose all my inhibitions
[1:00:51] and just but I can't do that right now
[1:00:55] now remember they're just like Cain and
[1:01:00] Abel they look so much alike for a while
[1:01:01] but then a Cain showed his colors showed
[1:01:03] he was a terror right Jacob and Esau
[1:01:08] they look a lot a lot of like for a
[1:01:09] while but then Esau showed his colors
[1:01:11] Balaam and Moses they both had visions
[1:01:14] they both did supernatural things but
[1:01:16] pretty soon Balaam showed his his colors
[1:01:19] Judas and Jesus Judas did the same
[1:01:21] miracles he was sanctified the Bible
[1:01:23] said he was clean until the end when his
[1:01:26] money-hungry spear got on him right the
[1:01:28] devil got on him he showed his true
[1:01:30] colors sea wheat and tare they look so
[1:01:32] much alike but at some point they'll go
[1:01:34] their different ways the wheat will bow
[1:01:36] nod but the tare will defy the Word of
[1:01:40] God yes that's right
[1:01:42] both of them are offered the Word of God
[1:01:45] Cain God said Cain if you do what's
[1:01:48] right you'll be accepted
[1:01:49] I will accept you Cain if you bring a
[1:01:51] blood offering but he refused he just he
[1:01:55] got mad and he went and killed his
[1:01:56] brother see the we will always obey the
[1:01:59] word bring the right sacrifice have the
[1:02:02] revelation of true worship hallelujah
[1:02:04] but the tear will always defy it and
[1:02:06] hate it and bring the wrong sacrifice
[1:02:09] amen
[1:02:14] see now the trouble is the the deceptive
[1:02:18] part is in Matthew 7:21 not everyone
[1:02:20] that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter
[1:02:22] in the kingdom of heaven but he that
[1:02:24] doeth the will of my father which is in
[1:02:26] heaven many will say to me in that day
[1:02:28] Lord Lord have we not prophesied then a
[1:02:30] see prophesy tears can prophesy member
[1:02:33] Caiaphas prophesied he Kyah Caiaphas
[1:02:36] said one man has to die for this nation
[1:02:38] and he prophesied that Jesus Christ
[1:02:41] would die and he was right and brother
[1:02:44] man said he did that because that was
[1:02:46] the office of God when you're in that
[1:02:47] kind of office that anointing gets on
[1:02:49] you so he prophesied right but yet he
[1:02:52] crucified and hated Jesus in that
[1:02:54] strikin he could prophesy one minute he
[1:02:58] says how much he hates Jesus and he's
[1:02:59] jesus blaspheming the next minute he's
[1:03:02] prophesying and he's exactly right
[1:03:04] oh my thank God for discernment in this
[1:03:07] hour thank God the way we know is
[1:03:09] discerning who stays with the word who
[1:03:12] obeys the word who speaks right of the
[1:03:14] Word of God see they can cast out devils
[1:03:20] Judas cast out Devils he did miracles
[1:03:22] just like the other eleven and then thy
[1:03:26] name done many wonderful works
[1:03:27] then I'll profess unto you I never knew
[1:03:29] you depart from me ye that work iniquity
[1:03:32] now Paul says these tears are tears
[1:03:37] spoken of in the last days they're
[1:03:39] lovers of their own selves covetous
[1:03:40] boasters proud blasphemers disobedient
[1:03:42] to parents see children I thank God that
[1:03:45] you obey me because one of the spirits
[1:03:48] of this age is children that will
[1:03:50] disobey their parents so god bless all
[1:03:53] you little ones for listening to mom and
[1:03:55] keep doing it now that that's how you
[1:03:57] know you got the right spirit is that
[1:04:00] right there's either disobedient to
[1:04:03] parents because they got the wrong
[1:04:05] spirit and now of course everybody
[1:04:08] disobeys a time so that's why we need
[1:04:09] the correction of the the rod you know
[1:04:11] we need the correction of I got it I got
[1:04:14] the whip and to help me by God's grace
[1:04:16] of course it wasn't abuse you know but
[1:04:18] it was it was correction ah now he says
[1:04:27] tears do some good works but they Harbor
[1:04:30] wicked selfish hearts but they put on a
[1:04:33] public church membership act but true
[1:04:38] Christians are purified and they live
[1:04:41] the same whether they at church or
[1:04:43] they're at home they live the same all
[1:04:44] the time
[1:04:45] tears will go and they'll do miracles in
[1:04:48] the church on Sunday but come around
[1:04:50] Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
[1:04:52] Saturday they're living for the world
[1:04:54] they're living for themselves they're
[1:04:55] selfish they're boasters they're proud
[1:04:58] they're arrogant they're haters of those
[1:05:01] who are good but see they get and then
[1:05:04] they know how to get in the anointing
[1:05:05] right they know how to approach God and
[1:05:07] worship God with the right sacrifice at
[1:05:10] least for the anointing but they never
[1:05:12] obey all the Word of God that's a great
[1:05:15] mystery but that's why Jesus told this
[1:05:17] parable because it's one of the
[1:05:18] mysteries revealed praise God
[1:05:22] now let's move on here yeah okay I
[1:05:28] mention that okay now here's
[1:05:32] they notice to remember the scripture
[1:05:34] said at harvest time that tears are
[1:05:36] gathered first before the wheat and
[1:05:38] brother man tells us that's the
[1:05:40] economical counsel before the rapture
[1:05:42] right so the churches are all gonna join
[1:05:45] well you know it's okay we're all
[1:05:47] Catholic we're all Baptist Methodist
[1:05:48] we're all the same anyway
[1:05:49] that's not true no we're different
[1:05:52] because we're blood washed
[1:05:54] we're washed by the blood we have more
[1:05:57] than just a confession we have a
[1:05:58] possession amen see they just many
[1:06:01] churches just have a confession they
[1:06:04] just say I'm a Christian I was baptized
[1:06:06] I I love Jesus but we've got to have
[1:06:09] Jesus himself faint ahead we've got to
[1:06:12] have the Holy Ghost himself living
[1:06:13] inside of us we got to have a confession
[1:06:16] and a possession but many of them just
[1:06:19] have a membership act they're just
[1:06:21] acting like Christians when they're
[1:06:23] really not
[1:06:23] and they're gathered first so the tears
[1:06:29] are gathered first in the ecumenical
[1:06:30] council brother Branham said that they
[1:06:33] will be comes the churches will unite
[1:06:35] with the government and they'll be so
[1:06:38] tightly united together that the
[1:06:40] churches will influence the government
[1:06:42] to make new laws that persecute real
[1:06:45] Christians right but listen Church the
[1:06:48] whole time those churches and government
[1:06:51] are gonna be calling themselves
[1:06:52] Christians right because it's a
[1:06:55] deception they're gonna be calling the
[1:06:57] government and church is gonna be
[1:06:58] calling themselves Christians but where
[1:07:00] are the real Christians they were gonna
[1:07:01] probably cost radicals they're gonna
[1:07:03] call us for nags they're gonna they're
[1:07:05] gonna probably make us look like hate
[1:07:07] crime people because we love the Word of
[1:07:10] God and we hate sin that's the only
[1:07:11] thing I'm guilty of is hate and sin
[1:07:13] praise God
[1:07:14] I don't even hate the people that do it
[1:07:15] I just hate sin itself right the Bible
[1:07:17] said we should hate even our own sin we
[1:07:20] should hate the garment spotted with the
[1:07:22] flesh the Bible says we should hate our
[1:07:25] own sin but we don't hate our enemies in
[1:07:27] fact we love our enemies but we've got
[1:07:29] to speak truth to them and tell them the
[1:07:31] truth see but the government the church
[1:07:34] and government false church and
[1:07:35] government will unite and that's the
[1:07:37] gathering the tares first before before
[1:07:41] the burning now you
[1:07:44] know this if you haven't let me know in
[1:07:47] 2016
[1:07:48] the Pope called for a uniting of Jews
[1:07:52] Christians Muslims and Buddhists I got
[1:07:54] the video if you haven't seen it has
[1:07:56] anyone not seen it they were not seeing
[1:07:57] it raise your have you've not seen it ok
[1:07:59] so mature ok remind me I'll share with
[1:08:02] you the Pope says those four religions
[1:08:07] you need to unite and that's not that's
[1:08:09] wrong the Muslims don't even believe
[1:08:13] Jesus was the Messiah they believe he's
[1:08:16] a prophet but they don't even recognize
[1:08:17] his precious blood was shed for their
[1:08:19] sins so in other words they reject the
[1:08:22] atonement they can't be clean they can't
[1:08:24] be one with God because they reject the
[1:08:26] way to be clean through the cross of
[1:08:28] Jesus Christ so how can we unite with a
[1:08:30] group that denies Jesus Christ there is
[1:08:33] no unity with that there's only
[1:08:35] separation a true child of God has to
[1:08:38] separate that and the only one we unite
[1:08:40] to is Jesus Christ amen
[1:08:43] so that was 2016 that's why we've known
[1:08:46] the rapture is getting closer we know by
[1:08:48] logic as well you know every day that
[1:08:50] goes by were a day closer but when we
[1:08:53] see the Pope who will be the future
[1:08:54] Antichrist when we see him calling for
[1:08:57] all the great religions of the world to
[1:08:59] unite we know we're getting closer
[1:09:00] Church we just got to keep our eyes open
[1:09:03] and we got to keep watching and we got
[1:09:05] to keep praying praise God we won't miss
[1:09:08] it by the grace of the Lord and remember
[1:09:14] all the nations will commit adultery
[1:09:16] with the mother harlot Roman Catholic
[1:09:18] Church remember that that's from
[1:09:20] revelation to 22 and 23 and 13 14 18 see
[1:09:26] they're gonna have this unity and it's a
[1:09:28] it's an adultery spiritually speaking
[1:09:30] they say they're married to this right
[1:09:32] your church but when they don't obey it
[1:09:34] they're not married to it they're our
[1:09:35] adulterer against it but when we obey it
[1:09:38] we're married to it amen
[1:09:40] and we're keeping our vow praise the
[1:09:42] Lord we are keeping our vow by keeping
[1:09:44] the Word of God all right
[1:09:52] let me just finish up with this one you
[1:09:56] and I can't always identify every tear
[1:09:59] some of them we can like like I'm trying
[1:10:04] to think of a few examples Oh like some
[1:10:05] of the preachers have left the message
[1:10:06] over the last few years I told you this
[1:10:09] one of them was real famous worldwide
[1:10:10] famous and for years I just wondered how
[1:10:13] can this guy be a message believer
[1:10:15] because I had six doctrines he was wrong
[1:10:17] with he let women cut their hair wear
[1:10:19] makeup he was wrong on the baptism of
[1:10:21] the Holy Ghost he persecuted brother
[1:10:23] Brooks and made fun of his worship in
[1:10:25] the spirit in other words he mocked the
[1:10:27] holy spirit and said oh you're making
[1:10:29] love to Jesus and he said it in a kind
[1:10:31] of a blasphemous way and there was two
[1:10:33] other doctrines for all these years of
[1:10:36] Mike how can this guy be so popular in
[1:10:37] the message and then just a few years
[1:10:39] later he left the message and after that
[1:10:43] I was so happy because I thought my eye
[1:10:45] was looking at the fruits and I'm
[1:10:47] scratching my head how can this guy have
[1:10:49] these kind of fruits and all these
[1:10:50] people in the message flocked to him I
[1:10:52] thought it's something wrong with me
[1:10:54] sister Naomi I was kind of like knocking
[1:10:55] on my head I said what what's wrong with
[1:10:57] me
[1:10:57] how can all these people flock to
[1:10:59] somebody who breaks the word but see
[1:11:02] Jesus said by their fruits you shall
[1:11:04] know them
[1:11:05] see watch him Bible said mark those who
[1:11:07] break the word who cause division LARC
[1:11:10] them be careful around those kind of
[1:11:12] people and pretty soon I'll show their
[1:11:13] colors that's right
[1:11:17] see tears are self loving self-serving
[1:11:21] false worshipers the only worship to
[1:11:25] serve themselves they only worship to
[1:11:28] love themselves instead of loving Jesus
[1:11:31] Christ the word of God
[1:11:32] alright okay I may get done with the
[1:11:36] next one so let's go the next one okay
[1:11:38] got your Bibles here hope that was a
[1:11:40] blessing was that helpful by God's grace
[1:11:42] hopefully that helped you by the grace
[1:11:44] or see this is the endtime kingdom of
[1:11:47] heaven parable next one let me turn
[1:11:49] there I almost got a hundred thousand
[1:11:53] words on my book I'm not even halfway
[1:11:54] done so I don't know what's gonna happen
[1:11:56] with this much but I hope it's a
[1:11:59] blessing like I told you on Amazon I got
[1:12:02] a review from a woman named Kate I don't
[1:12:04] even know her she's like I never knew
[1:12:05] about you
[1:12:07] purpose that's a reason God had me write
[1:12:09] that book because God knew that woman
[1:12:11] would want to know the truth why does
[1:12:12] the Bible say about makeup what does the
[1:12:14] Bible say about long hair was the Bible
[1:12:16] say so God had to have me write it to
[1:12:18] help that person out and of course help
[1:12:19] all the other people who were blessed by
[1:12:21] it but see that's what we're to do in
[1:12:23] this hour we're supposed to do
[1:12:24] everything we can to get the message out
[1:12:27] compel them amen compel them beg them
[1:12:30] give them away free do anything you can
[1:12:32] do try to get people to receive the
[1:12:34] Christ and try to get them to come to
[1:12:36] the rapture the marriage supper of the
[1:12:38] Lamb
[1:12:38] amen do anything you can do to try to
[1:12:40] get them to come to the supper praise
[1:12:42] God okay so it's Matthew 13 47 let's do
[1:12:49] one more the net cast in the sea
[1:12:51] I got a few quotes and we'll I'll try it
[1:12:54] give me about 15 more minutes Lord
[1:12:56] willing I've done pretty good I've been
[1:13:00] a good good young man behaving myself
[1:13:02] here noticed I call myself a young man
[1:13:05] 38 years old brother man would call me a
[1:13:09] boy preacher that's what he called
[1:13:12] people younger than him he was 56 and
[1:13:14] got him boy preachers that's alright
[1:13:17] that's you thirteen forty seven so this
[1:13:21] is the second one it's all about the end
[1:13:23] time oh my I'm so happy to have the
[1:13:26] revelations of the endtime hallelujah we
[1:13:30] can see jesus said they cannot see the
[1:13:33] kingdom of God but we can see it we can
[1:13:36] see the kingdom of God is gathering
[1:13:37] around the word in a real small
[1:13:39] gathering like tonight it's not rock and
[1:13:41] roll it's not the big million dollar
[1:13:43] churches although there could be a big
[1:13:45] church that was the truth it's not
[1:13:47] worldliness is not financial prosperity
[1:13:49] all the time it's not big TV programs
[1:13:52] and everything like that
[1:13:53] it's obedience to the Word of God it's
[1:13:55] being born again the Holy Ghost it's
[1:13:57] been the real Church of God the book of
[1:13:59] Acts church amen
[1:14:02] Matthew 13 47 it's 47 to 50
[1:14:13] okay 13:47 again the kingdom of heaven
[1:14:17] is like unto a net that was cast into
[1:14:19] the sea and gathered of every kind which
[1:14:24] when it was full they drew to shore and
[1:14:27] sat down and gathered the good into
[1:14:28] vessels but cast the bad away now look
[1:14:34] what he says this beautiful verse 49 so
[1:14:36] shall it be at the end at the beginning
[1:14:39] the end this is an endtime revelation
[1:14:44] the angel should come forth and sever
[1:14:47] the wicked from among the just and shall
[1:14:50] cast them into the furnace of fire there
[1:14:52] shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth
[1:14:55] just like we heard in the other pair of
[1:14:56] all I like 51 look at this huh I wonder
[1:15:02] if this I wonder if the disciples were
[1:15:04] totally honest on this one or not and
[1:15:06] Jesus said to them have you understood
[1:15:08] all these things they say unto Him yeh
[1:15:10] Lord I don't know if they knew that or
[1:15:13] not I don't know maybe they were just
[1:15:15] saying that they heard it I don't know
[1:15:18] it's possible they could have they could
[1:15:20] have verse 52 then said he unto them
[1:15:24] therefore every scribe which is
[1:15:25] instructed on the kingdom of heaven is
[1:15:27] like unto a man that is a householder
[1:15:29] which bringeth forth out of his treasure
[1:15:31] things new and old praise God alright
[1:15:37] now let's look at this one and we'll
[1:15:38] finish with this parable tonight okay
[1:15:43] once again we see two different types of
[1:15:45] people right we see some neither gather
[1:15:48] into a vessels of angels a collection
[1:15:52] vessel of angels and we see other that
[1:15:55] are just cast away bad we see good
[1:15:57] vessels bad vessels just like wheat good
[1:16:00] tare bad we see both the same idea and
[1:16:05] this parable foretells a worldwide
[1:16:08] gathering under Christianity that
[1:16:11] requires a final separation between the
[1:16:13] wick and the just see it's required it
[1:16:15] has to happen because Jesus said let
[1:16:17] both grow together and the other parable
[1:16:19] there's going to be right amongst us we
[1:16:21] can have true believers here and we can
[1:16:23] have false believers here only time will
[1:16:25] tell
[1:16:25] Oh
[1:16:26] fruits will tell and we've got to we got
[1:16:29] to make sure our fruit is the right kind
[1:16:30] of fruit praise God
[1:16:34] alright next the net is the universal
[1:16:39] invitation to Christianity that Christ
[1:16:44] commissioned his disciples to go into
[1:16:47] all the world and preach the gospel to
[1:16:49] every creature so the Great Commission
[1:16:50] the net is the Great Commission preach
[1:16:52] the good news see it's good news the bad
[1:16:55] news is you're a sinner I'm a sinner
[1:16:57] that's the bad news and our sins make us
[1:16:59] worthy of Hell but the good news is
[1:17:01] Jesus Christ died for your sins and if
[1:17:06] you believe in him he'll give you power
[1:17:07] to become a son or daughter of God
[1:17:09] that's the good news amen he'll break
[1:17:12] the chains of addiction he'll break the
[1:17:14] chains of lust and greed and fear and
[1:17:16] pride he'll break all those chains and
[1:17:18] he'll set you free and it'll make you a
[1:17:20] vessel of honor and it'll make you full
[1:17:23] of power praise God hey man
[1:17:27] and remember there's this beautiful
[1:17:30] member what does the C represent this
[1:17:32] parable says it's a net cast in the sea
[1:17:34] what does the sea represent in
[1:17:36] revelation 17 people's multitudes
[1:17:38] nations and tongues and that beautiful I
[1:17:41] didn't see that till recently that bless
[1:17:43] my heart so the parable the symbols
[1:17:46] match the symbols in the book of
[1:17:48] Revelation our Lord prophesied that n
[1:17:52] would not come until every nation heard
[1:17:55] the gospel imitation or the gospel net
[1:17:57] was thrown into every part of the world
[1:17:59] ocean we'd say praise God remember Jesus
[1:18:04] called his first preachers fishers of
[1:18:05] men so the invitation becomes Christian
[1:18:10] as a spiritual net that draws men to
[1:18:13] Christ
[1:18:14] see Jesus throughout the net to Judas
[1:18:17] and it grabbed him for a while but later
[1:18:19] he was taken out because of the evil in
[1:18:21] his heart so just answering the call of
[1:18:25] Jesus doesn't make you saved it doesn't
[1:18:27] guarantee salvation because Jesus said
[1:18:30] many are called but few are chosen
[1:18:32] praise God
[1:18:37] all right now this net scenarios for the
[1:18:41] last days Jesus specifically says this
[1:18:43] is for the end of the world and it's
[1:18:47] because Jesus foretold many people would
[1:18:52] be attracted to Christianity but it's a
[1:18:54] mere profession of the faith rather than
[1:18:58] true possession of the faith Jesus said
[1:19:01] the same thing when he was on the earth
[1:19:03] he said this people draws nigh to me
[1:19:05] with their mouths but their heart is far
[1:19:08] from me in vain do they worship Me
[1:19:12] teaching for doctrines the commandments
[1:19:14] of men
[1:19:15] so that's how you always can recognize a
[1:19:18] tear or someone who's deceived their
[1:19:21] doctrine is not a doctrine from the
[1:19:24] Bible it's a teaching from the thought
[1:19:26] of man okay like sprinkling at baptism
[1:19:28] that's not in the Bible that's a
[1:19:30] doctrine a man letting women preach or
[1:19:32] cut their hair right letting men divorce
[1:19:35] their wives and marry two three times
[1:19:36] and or even polygamy that's a doctrine a
[1:19:39] man that's not a doctrine of the Bible
[1:19:41] see it's a doctor and a man and the by
[1:19:44] Jesus said their worship is in vain
[1:19:46] Jesus is not receiving that worship
[1:19:48] because it's not according to the Word
[1:19:50] of God praise God
[1:19:59] now remember Paul said deceivers would
[1:20:01] wax worse and worse so they're gonna get
[1:20:03] more and more deceptive as we come
[1:20:06] closer to the end time the false church
[1:20:08] is going to be more and more like the
[1:20:11] true church because Paul said it was
[1:20:12] prophecy
[1:20:13] it'll be wax worse and worse the
[1:20:17] deception is going to get harder and
[1:20:19] harder to to deceive let me just bring
[1:20:23] this thought out and hope everybody
[1:20:25] understands here I love the people in
[1:20:27] jeffersonville but listen most of them
[1:20:29] have a false doctrine they say every
[1:20:31] word brother Branham said was thus saith
[1:20:33] the Lord that's not true that's a lie
[1:20:35] that's wrong that's a false doctrine but
[1:20:38] listen Church they are anointed when
[1:20:40] they worship God anoints them here's
[1:20:42] proof they had a man died a couple years
[1:20:44] ago in their service they went and
[1:20:46] prayed for him and brought him back to
[1:20:47] life and they had a doctor there in
[1:20:50] their church he was
[1:20:51] a church member and he was one of the
[1:20:54] ones that was up there and verified he
[1:20:55] died and then he was there when he came
[1:20:57] back to life a doctor and they got on
[1:20:59] YouTube you can go on YouTube and look
[1:21:00] at it they have the it's recorded and
[1:21:03] everything like it was it would be like
[1:21:05] a miracle you and I would want to have
[1:21:07] it was recorded it was I mean that they
[1:21:11] died they prayed the man came back to
[1:21:13] life but they have a false doctrine they
[1:21:18] say pastors shouldn't preach anymore in
[1:21:19] fact they called our church a Dimas
[1:21:22] Church they say anyone who doesn't play
[1:21:26] the tapes is a make believer so they're
[1:21:28] calling churches like ours make
[1:21:30] believers but if there's a if there's a
[1:21:34] question what do we do go back to the
[1:21:36] word the Bible never says pastor should
[1:21:38] stop preaching in fact Paul said preach
[1:21:42] the word be instant in season out of
[1:21:45] season and rebuke correct with all
[1:21:48] long-suffering because there will come a
[1:21:50] time when they'll heat to themselves
[1:21:52] teachers having itching ears and many
[1:21:55] shall depart from the faith church we're
[1:21:57] not departing from the faith we're
[1:21:58] keeping the faith but see they can have
[1:22:02] such an anointing and have the wrong
[1:22:04] spirit and church it's almost idolatry I
[1:22:07] think some of those people are actually
[1:22:08] worshiping brother Branham and they're
[1:22:11] so close to the truth but they're so off
[1:22:14] as well many things they have right but
[1:22:17] some things are totally wrong and they
[1:22:19] name car churches and they they say
[1:22:21] we're not believers and I'm not saying
[1:22:23] what they're I'm just saying they're off
[1:22:24] the word that's what I'm saying and
[1:22:26] their own fruits will judge them but we
[1:22:29] are called to recognize and call out
[1:22:31] false doctrine now how about that how
[1:22:34] many knew that there was a man raised
[1:22:36] from the dead at the church they may
[1:22:37] know that is that new to everybody that
[1:22:40] was a couple years ago and that's when I
[1:22:42] started paying attention I was like well
[1:22:44] let me watch this move let me see what
[1:22:46] doctrines come out of here and that's
[1:22:48] why I started writing them down so I
[1:22:50] could preach him to you so you would
[1:22:51] know the anointing is great the worship
[1:22:54] is great that's wonderful and thank God
[1:22:57] for the miracles we thank God for the
[1:22:59] miracles listen God does miracles here -
[1:23:01] praise God
[1:23:02] thank the Lord for that
[1:23:05] hallelujah but it's got to come down to
[1:23:08] the word the word who obeys the word
[1:23:10] who's got the truth because the Holy
[1:23:12] Ghost will guide us into all truth
[1:23:14] that's the promise of God that's the
[1:23:16] evidence of the Holy Ghost the Word of
[1:23:19] God guiding you into all truth John
[1:23:20] 16:13 jesus said when the comforters
[1:23:23] come he'll not speak of himself he'll
[1:23:25] speak of me and he said when the
[1:23:26] comforter comes he'll guide you into all
[1:23:28] truth saying brother Branham every word
[1:23:31] he says thus saith the Lord that's not
[1:23:32] all truth that's being guided away from
[1:23:34] the truth that's that's I bring in
[1:23:37] idolatry into the church saying pastor
[1:23:40] should not preach any more that's wrong
[1:23:42] that's that's anti word right which we
[1:23:46] know is Antichrist
[1:23:48] it's a it's a small innocent form of the
[1:23:51] Antichrist spirit and I just wanted you
[1:23:55] to see that that people can have great
[1:23:57] miracles even around us remember it's
[1:23:59] gonna get closer and closer and closer
[1:24:01] so we got to be in the word more and
[1:24:03] more and more we got to read our Bibles
[1:24:05] amen we gotta listen to brother brain
[1:24:07] and we got to take everything he says
[1:24:08] back to the word we got listen to you
[1:24:11] listen to your pastor you know listen to
[1:24:12] the banjos that come through listen to
[1:24:13] everything that's being preached take it
[1:24:15] back to the word don't take nothing for
[1:24:17] granted
[1:24:17] just obey the word of God fall more in
[1:24:19] love with Jesus all the time
[1:24:20] amen now jesus said the Holy Ghost in
[1:24:27] Matthew 5:45 is like rain
[1:24:30] he said he makes his Sun to rise on the
[1:24:32] good and evil and sendeth rain on the
[1:24:34] just and the unjust that's why so many
[1:24:38] people are attracted to Christianity
[1:24:39] they come in worship and they feel good
[1:24:41] they come and worship and God will heal
[1:24:43] them but see not only does the rain come
[1:24:47] to do that to heal them the rain comes
[1:24:49] to get them to produce the right kind of
[1:24:51] fruit God wants you to produce fruit not
[1:24:53] just grow up and get strong that's good
[1:24:56] thank God for that
[1:24:57] but God wants you to produce the fruit
[1:24:58] of the Holy Spirit but see tears or we
[1:25:02] say like that they just want the rain
[1:25:04] because it makes them feel good it makes
[1:25:05] them feel like they're growing but it
[1:25:07] depends which side you're growing
[1:25:08] towards it depends what you want to
[1:25:10] produce with your life do you want to
[1:25:12] produce righteousness or do you want to
[1:25:14] produce self-love and and and and and
[1:25:17] treasures of this world
[1:25:18] where we stored our treasures we got to
[1:25:21] store them in heaven hallelujah so see
[1:25:25] the the rain represents the anointing
[1:25:28] here that's why everyone's gathered the
[1:25:30] neck attracts so many because the
[1:25:32] anointing is so beautiful don't you love
[1:25:34] the cried worship the Lord I was doing
[1:25:36] that earlier
[1:25:37] don't you love to cry and sing and
[1:25:38] praise the Lord and and feel all clean
[1:25:40] out in your heart don't you love that
[1:25:41] people that's why I said you know that's
[1:25:44] why false church members like that too
[1:25:45] it's a it's it's a wonderful feeling
[1:25:47] it's a refreshing feeling but we got it
[1:25:50] I want more than just the the anointing
[1:25:53] we got to have the life of the Holy
[1:25:54] Spirit as well he's God see the Bible
[1:26:01] says the Spirit breaks the yokes in
[1:26:03] Isaiah 10:27 so a lot of people like to
[1:26:05] like experience being free from certain
[1:26:08] things but we got to be totally free he
[1:26:12] whom the Sun sets free is free indeed
[1:26:13] from all addictions right from all us
[1:26:16] but some people just like to get free
[1:26:18] from a few things like Jesus told the
[1:26:21] story of the man who was in his house
[1:26:23] and and in Matthew 12 and he drove out
[1:26:26] the demons but the demons after a while
[1:26:28] I said I'm gonna go back and see if I
[1:26:29] can get into my house
[1:26:30] see people will get free for a while but
[1:26:33] then the demons will come back it'll be
[1:26:34] seven times worse than it was at the
[1:26:36] beginning see that's what a lot of
[1:26:38] people like they like to be free how
[1:26:40] many times have I seen my cousin
[1:26:41] different ones they get free from drugs
[1:26:43] and they rejoice and shout and scream
[1:26:46] but a few weeks later they're right back
[1:26:48] into it and it's seven times worse even
[1:26:51] in my family I've seen that it's
[1:26:52] heartbreaking but see the reason Jesus
[1:26:55] cleans you out so he can fill you praise
[1:26:57] God that's why I cleans you out so he
[1:27:00] can fill you so you can live in you not
[1:27:02] just you know a few miracles are a few
[1:27:04] good feelings you know but a life of
[1:27:06] life that's fully consecrated and
[1:27:08] devoted to Jesus Christ amen see that's
[1:27:13] what we want by the grace of the Lord in
[1:27:16] Hebrews 6:4 2:8
[1:27:18] Paul compares wicked people to briars
[1:27:22] and thorns so you have thorns in your
[1:27:24] garden right you have briars in your
[1:27:26] garden I hate those things I usually
[1:27:29] smoke over them though but
[1:27:32] Paul says wicked people are like that
[1:27:33] they grow up like thorns and briers but
[1:27:36] they enjoy the rain they feed on the
[1:27:38] rain they love the anointing of the Holy
[1:27:40] Spirit but their N is to be plucked up
[1:27:43] and burned the fire Paul says they can
[1:27:47] listen terse
[1:27:48] Paul says this they can be enlightened
[1:27:50] by the Holy Spirit the Spirit can
[1:27:52] enlighten their thinking Wow
[1:27:55] the Bible said they can taste of
[1:27:57] heavenly gifts you say brother
[1:28:01] my tasted his good word last night a
[1:28:04] tear can say the same thing I tasted a
[1:28:07] good message all that was delicious
[1:28:10] you know that was such a glorious
[1:28:11] message tears can say the same thing for
[1:28:14] a while Paul said they can be partakers
[1:28:20] of the Holy Ghost they can receive that
[1:28:21] oh I feel so fresh I feel so clean oh
[1:28:24] what a great service but then the Bible
[1:28:27] said they can fall away from living a
[1:28:30] true Christian life just as a thorn
[1:28:33] lives off the rain so do sinners live
[1:28:36] off God's anointing they do but they're
[1:28:39] not the true sea they're not the churn
[1:28:41] of God and they do not bring forth godly
[1:28:44] fruit because they're workers of
[1:28:47] iniquity
[1:28:56] for this let's go I'm almost done here
[1:29:01] Jesus said in Matthew 24:24 he said many
[1:29:05] false Christ's and false prophets will
[1:29:07] come among you what does Christ mean is
[1:29:10] now remember but RAM always emphasized
[1:29:11] this he said you didn't say false
[1:29:13] Jesus's because anybody who comes with
[1:29:17] oh I'm Jesus I'm a false cheesier I'm a
[1:29:19] Jesus and I've got uh I've got marks in
[1:29:22] my palms I've got scars in my palm that
[1:29:25] would that wouldn't trick any real
[1:29:26] believer right geez then say false
[1:29:28] Jesus's will come he said false Christ's
[1:29:31] and Christ means The Anointed they're
[1:29:33] gonna come false
[1:29:34] anointed ones right though and the thing
[1:29:38] is that the hard thing is they got both
[1:29:40] anointings at times they got the right
[1:29:42] anointing when they do a miracle but
[1:29:45] then they leave that anointing and then
[1:29:46] the knowing of Satan will just like
[1:29:47] Caiaphas right he's he's putting Jesus
[1:29:50] on trial he's slapping or spitting out
[1:29:52] accusing Jesus and then he prophesized
[1:29:54] at the meeting a few nights later said
[1:29:56] oh he's the one man has to die for our
[1:29:57] nation and he prophesized see they got
[1:30:01] the Spirit of God for a little while but
[1:30:03] then they reject it they don't want
[1:30:05] anymore and then the spirit of Satan
[1:30:06] comes upon him right he said false
[1:30:12] Christ's in Matthew 24:24 alright let me
[1:30:20] look at a few more notes here Balaam is
[1:30:23] that one of the clearest examples
[1:30:27] Balaam spoke directly to God in extended
[1:30:32] conversations right in numbers chapter
[1:30:36] 23 24 and 25
[1:30:38] Balaam talks to God and God tells him
[1:30:42] what to do but then Balaam asked for a
[1:30:43] second opinion well God can't I go God
[1:30:46] already said no church you and I don't
[1:30:47] need to ask God for second opinions what
[1:30:50] he tells you the first time you need to
[1:30:52] obey that what the word says the first
[1:30:54] time obey it just like women preachers
[1:30:56] well I asked God if I could preach he
[1:30:59] told me I could well that wasn't the
[1:31:00] first thing he said because the first
[1:31:02] thing he said was I do not suffer a
[1:31:04] woman to a Serpa 40 over a man that's
[1:31:07] the first thing he said right
[1:31:09] then yeah you keep begging God and keep
[1:31:12] begging god yeah and he knows your heart
[1:31:13] is selfish yeah I let a woman preach
[1:31:16] later but he won't let them preach the
[1:31:18] first time just like Balaam he wouldn't
[1:31:21] let Balaam go the first time but the
[1:31:22] second time with an evil heart God said
[1:31:24] fine go if you really want to go and you
[1:31:26] really want to lust after money
[1:31:27] go ahead Church Balaam he talked to God
[1:31:36] face to face but he led to 24,000 people
[1:31:39] dying remember that at bay o PR God sent
[1:31:44] a plague and his false teaching that
[1:31:46] said we're all the same we can all
[1:31:47] worship you you men you can you can take
[1:31:51] and sleep with these virgins of Moab
[1:31:52] it's okay you'd have to marry him God
[1:31:55] said I hate that I'm not forgiving you
[1:31:58] 24,000 people died in one day 24,000 see
[1:32:04] that's a man lets us that's an insane
[1:32:06] man the Bible said Balaam he could go
[1:32:08] from talking to God and then he could go
[1:32:10] to teach and false doctrine just to make
[1:32:13] a little money that's what they do today
[1:32:15] that's so many people do today let me
[1:32:18] show you a quote here I don't remember
[1:32:21] this quote Balaam anointed with the same
[1:32:23] spirit that was upon Moses what was the
[1:32:25] difference the teaching of Moses was
[1:32:28] perfect the church said see they both
[1:32:33] had supernatural they both had miracles
[1:32:34] they both could talk to God they both
[1:32:37] prophesied but what was the difference
[1:32:40] Moses taught the people holiness Moses
[1:32:43] taught the people to obey the Word of
[1:32:45] God Balaam said oh it's okay to have sex
[1:32:48] outside of marriage it's okay to worship
[1:32:51] but we're different churches and no
[1:32:52] matter what you believe we're all one
[1:32:54] it's a lie the Bible said here in 2nd
[1:32:58] Peter it was the teaching of Balaam that
[1:32:59] Israel received that God never did
[1:33:01] forgive unpardonable sin not a one of
[1:33:04] them got saved though they had come out
[1:33:05] under the blessings of God had seen the
[1:33:07] hand of God moving by his mighty prophet
[1:33:09] and seen it exactly vindicated by God
[1:33:12] the member church all those people that
[1:33:13] died at 24,000 they all were baptized
[1:33:16] under Moses and the church said they all
[1:33:19] got baptized by the prophet Moses I'll
[1:33:21] say like that because they went through
[1:33:22] the Red Sea
[1:33:24] I don't care if william branham baptized
[1:33:25] you or some big-name preacher they don't
[1:33:28] matter people like that can still fall
[1:33:29] away the thing to do is have the Holy
[1:33:32] Spirit to guide you into all truth
[1:33:35] because Balaam was known by his false
[1:33:38] teaching Librium said because another
[1:33:42] prophet come in with a teaching contrary
[1:33:44] and disputed with Moses and tried to
[1:33:48] prove to the people that Moses was wrong
[1:33:50] and Dathan core and many of them agreed
[1:33:53] with him and taught the children Israel
[1:33:55] to commit fornication
[1:33:56] to go after his organization that were
[1:33:58] all the same no we're not now Judas you
[1:34:04] know is another great example he casts
[1:34:06] out unclean spirits he had power to cast
[1:34:08] him out he had power to heal all manner
[1:34:10] of sickness imagine that Judas had power
[1:34:12] to kill Kay I'm sorry to heal cancer did
[1:34:15] you know that all manner of sickness
[1:34:17] Judas could cure because Jesus gave him
[1:34:20] that authority but then at the Last
[1:34:23] Supper what he do
[1:34:24] jesus said what do you ever got to do go
[1:34:26] do quickly and as soon as he left out
[1:34:28] Satan entered into his heart see he was
[1:34:33] a traitor he was lost went to his own
[1:34:36] place as a son of perdition or
[1:34:38] destruction
[1:34:40] Judas fulfilled revelation 3:15 Judas's
[1:34:45] name was blot out of the book of life
[1:34:47] how me know that he claimed to be
[1:34:50] sanctified he claimed to be a believer
[1:34:51] for those three and half years but then
[1:34:53] when he sold out jesus said I'll blot
[1:34:55] your name off the book of life he walked
[1:34:58] in it for a while but then he rejected
[1:35:00] it his name got brought it out at one
[1:35:05] time let me
[1:35:06] just tell this quick story here we were
[1:35:09] having a Bible study at my house in
[1:35:11] Congo Falls this was quite a few years
[1:35:12] ago case you must have been a real tiny
[1:35:15] baby at that time and it's a kind of a
[1:35:17] sad story but I just want to give you a
[1:35:18] little warning tonight there's a brother
[1:35:21] I'll just use his first name his name
[1:35:22] was Robert now there's you know a lot of
[1:35:25] Robert so oh I just want to give you a
[1:35:28] little warning here he had just come to
[1:35:31] the message he was baptized he was all
[1:35:33] excited he was doing Bible studies all
[1:35:35] the time but yet he had this hidden sin
[1:35:38] that nobody really knew about except a
[1:35:39] few people I didn't know about it
[1:35:41] and one day in Bible study he was kind
[1:35:45] of we were just biting the Bible he was
[1:35:47] kind of bragging on himself like oh I
[1:35:48] heard from God I heard the voice of God
[1:35:50] I thought and he said so see I must be
[1:35:53] that must mean I'm something special it
[1:35:56] was kind of a brag and the Holy Spirit
[1:35:59] in me I didn't rebuke him but I said
[1:36:00] well brother it's right my own house
[1:36:03] okay I said brother I said Judas heard
[1:36:06] the voice of Christ and I said Balaam
[1:36:10] heard the voice of God and he still sold
[1:36:12] out
[1:36:13] he still sold out Moses and the Word of
[1:36:16] God and God is my witness I remember it
[1:36:19] just really really vividly he stood up
[1:36:21] and he was you almost punched me in my
[1:36:23] own house
[1:36:24] you children won't remember and I'm just
[1:36:28] and they're like oh lord have mercy what
[1:36:29] did I do
[1:36:30] I'm just sharing the word because I knew
[1:36:33] what the word said anybody can hear the
[1:36:35] voice of God but it's those who obey the
[1:36:37] Word of God and what kind of spirit
[1:36:40] would get mad about that wouldn't you
[1:36:42] like what if it was true when do you
[1:36:43] just say oh that's that's good thought
[1:36:45] right but he got mad at me church within
[1:36:48] a year he had left his wife got addicted
[1:36:53] to drugs and slept with other women and
[1:36:55] got other children now he's in prison in
[1:36:58] a certain state not this day he's in
[1:37:00] prison for domestic abuse he's tattooed
[1:37:03] all up all over he don't even claim to
[1:37:05] serve God anymore complete heathen all's
[1:37:08] I did was share one little thing about
[1:37:10] the Word of God
[1:37:11] I said Balaam could hear the voice of
[1:37:13] God Judas could hear the voice of God
[1:37:15] and I said Cain can hear the voice of
[1:37:17] God he said would you say you call me a
[1:37:19] Judas I said no
[1:37:20] sir I'm just and Simon Church Simon had
[1:37:23] maybe he'll remember when he's here
[1:37:24] Simon had to come and stand between us
[1:37:26] cuz I'm just and they're like I'm not
[1:37:27] gonna fight you it's my house like I'm
[1:37:31] not leaving my house he's like one to
[1:37:34] fight me and Simon has Simon has a
[1:37:38] brother Robert come on calm down brother
[1:37:40] Jesse just he's just staring the
[1:37:41] scripture and I got so heartbroken I
[1:37:43] felt like I was gonna cry because like
[1:37:45] I'm just trying to help him out like I'm
[1:37:47] just trying to point something out and
[1:37:48] now I can look back sister Beatrice and
[1:37:50] I can see that was the word discerning
[1:37:53] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:37:54] the reason he shared about hearing God's
[1:37:56] voice was a prideful reason not a humble
[1:38:01] reason he was trying to exalt himself
[1:38:04] and just a few with like I said within a
[1:38:06] year gone out of church sleeping with
[1:38:10] other women different children by
[1:38:11] different women and got locked up in
[1:38:14] jail and he wanted to fight other
[1:38:16] preachers I know other preachers that he
[1:38:18] wanted to fight so what am I saying I'm
[1:38:24] saying this what the word says the word
[1:38:27] says if you've got the Spirit of Christ
[1:38:28] he'll guide you into all truth you'll
[1:38:30] fall in love with all the Bible you
[1:38:34] won't hold any sin in you won't hide
[1:38:35] secrets you'll obey all the Word of God
[1:38:38] I felt led to tell that story
[1:38:42] because anybody can hear the voice of
[1:38:43] God those women preachers that say they
[1:38:45] hear the voice of God I don't doubt that
[1:38:46] one bit but if they if they say they
[1:38:50] heard God's voice and a total lie that
[1:38:52] was the devil acting like God's voice
[1:38:54] that was a demon masquerading with a
[1:38:57] mask on looking like an angel if it
[1:39:01] breaks god's word all right
[1:39:13] see no denomination or movement whether
[1:39:16] it's charismatic Pentecostal word of
[1:39:18] faith Apostolic holiness or even the
[1:39:20] message miracles do not prove a person
[1:39:23] is saved
[1:39:24] or or a church is part of the kingdom of
[1:39:28] God the only way to know Jesus said by
[1:39:31] their fruit and the only way you can
[1:39:33] produce fruit is to be born again of the
[1:39:35] original seed praise God the
[1:39:38] incorruptible seed of God Peter said in
[1:39:40] first Peter 1:23 born again of that
[1:39:43] eternal seed the Holy Ghost amen
[1:39:46] that's the only way to do it let's stand
[1:39:52] to our feet here I better stop right
[1:39:55] there I got one more quote for you here
[1:40:00] hopefully this will be a blessing to you
[1:40:03] this is the fourth seal so it's also the
[1:40:06] fourth seal is the last seal that deals
[1:40:07] with the Gentiles still on the earth
[1:40:10] before the rapture look up brother
[1:40:12] Branham says now being baptized in Jesus
[1:40:15] name like my friend Robert or in the
[1:40:17] name of our Lord Jesus Christ rather
[1:40:18] that that's alright but that's not all
[1:40:20] of it yet no sir you could be baptized
[1:40:24] 50 times like that and that don't do a
[1:40:28] bit of good until that heart it's
[1:40:32] changed by the Holy Spirit it all has to
[1:40:34] go together notice it's Christ the
[1:40:36] Antichrist refuses the true bride
[1:40:39] doctrine praise God
[1:40:42] so what made what made Balaam different
[1:40:45] than Moses false false teaching false
[1:40:47] doctrine Moses had the right doctor and
[1:40:51] he had miracles that's what we got we
[1:40:53] got miracles we use in America last
[1:40:54] month our brother was healed I don't
[1:40:56] know if our sister Natalia I don't know
[1:40:57] if you heard about that or not but we
[1:40:58] prayed for a man his hips were read or
[1:41:02] degenerating he was gonna have two hip
[1:41:04] transplants we prayed for him we spoke
[1:41:07] life to his hips three days later after
[1:41:10] MRI the doctor said I don't know how
[1:41:12] this happened but your hips healed
[1:41:13] themselves they before the doctor said
[1:41:17] your hips can't heal themselves and they
[1:41:19] didn't Christ did it C so we have
[1:41:23] miracles too
[1:41:24] maybe different but God we have miracles
[1:41:27] too but no matter what the miracle is we
[1:41:29] got to have the miracle of a change life
[1:41:31] a life that loves the Word of God a life
[1:41:36] that wants to obey every promise of God
[1:41:38] hallelujah see we gotta have the real
[1:41:42] bride doctrine aren't you glad we got it
[1:41:44] I'm so happy I don't know if I'm any
[1:41:46] happy for anything else the blood of
[1:41:48] Jesus Christ has given us the true bride
[1:41:50] doctrine remember first Timothy 4 says
[1:41:54] give yourself to doctrine because it'll
[1:41:57] save you and then that here you now how
[1:42:01] much you come to the piano here we'll
[1:42:02] finish up here see and therefore the
[1:42:05] Antichrist takes his own bride now and
[1:42:08] builds her up see that false church is
[1:42:10] building up getting greater and greater
[1:42:12] and greater unto a Creed of his own
[1:42:16] takes his own bride and makes her a
[1:42:18] denomination she gives birth to other
[1:42:21] denominations as quote in this holy
[1:42:25] scriptures gives birth to daughters and
[1:42:28] she she becomes just like her mother
[1:42:30] natural worldly denominational opposing
[1:42:33] the spiritual bride the word praise God
[1:42:38] hallelujah what a wonderful word we've
[1:42:45] received church not because it's me it's
[1:42:47] God's Word
