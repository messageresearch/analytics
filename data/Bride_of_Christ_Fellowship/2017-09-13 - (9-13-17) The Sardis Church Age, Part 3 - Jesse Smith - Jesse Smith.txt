three of them to get back and do some Bible studies and so we're trying to do that by the grace of the Lord one of those Bible studies started about a year ago after putting Austin's baptism on face book and then this woman said I want to be baptized in water like that so we started the Bible study in fact we finally baptized her and then two other people in the name of Lord Jesus on Sunday night that was a real blessing so just if you would keep those families and prayer they're all from Copley so if you think about it when you pray please pray for the Copley families that God would add them to the message and God's calling for their life so let's take our Bibles here tonight it's go to Revelation chapter 3 look at verse 2 and 3 tonight revelation three two and three we're looking at the Sardis church age part three I realize I'm almost through this book on my own page 259 so to make it a good progress by God's grace and I love this book I love going to this book and looking forward to tonight's message by God's grace let me set a timer here so I don't go to too long here alright revelation 3 verse 2 revelation 3 verse 2 we'll start there read verses 2 & 3 verse 2 let's read verse 2 together and I'll read verse 3 verse 3 is kind of long let's read verse 2 on three one two three be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God now read verse 3 remember therefore how thou hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee he-man let's have word of Prayer that's God to minister to our hearts tonight through the word of God Lord in heaven again we pray Lord our third time praying Lord God this is a house of prayer Lord God we pray again Lord speak to us through thy word Lord when I read the quote where your prophet said after Jesus resurrected he wasn't they didn't understand all of his preaching but when he broke the bread Lord as he did before his crucifixion it opened the disciples eyes and they knew it was Jesus and Lord many times Lord maybe we don't catch everything during the preaching but Lord may do something tonight through the preaching and through just the act of the Holy Spirit that would let us know your presence is so near tonight Lord God we love you Lord and we want to see you in our Mitz Lord God and Lord we know it's you Lord that speaks and it burns our hearts Lord as the Cleophus and his friends said did not our hearts burn as he talked with us along the way talked to our hearts tonight Lord and let our hearts be sensitive to what your spirits saying father bless our efforts Lord and now I do pray Lord for those three souls I'd forgotten about those souls already this week such a busy and stressful week where father I do now pray for them thus my efforts Lord God to keep in touch with them and their efforts as well may we continue those Bible studies and may souls be one for your kingdom in Jesus Christ's name in every said Amen god bless you to be in season praise God [Music] all right so let's look at the Sardis church age tonight by God's grace we'll get as far as we can here by the grace of the Lord now look I do have slides so put all these quotes on here so whenever switch over no switch over God's grace [Music] all right so let's look at Part three tonight and trust you're enjoying the word of the Lord here I'm a preacher not on fear lately so it's kind of interesting just kind a little different to get back to the Sardis church age so we're thankful we read our text I didn't reverse one but we read two and three tonight we're looking at the warning of finishing verse one and verse two we've gone through I've we preached the salutation from Jesus right he says I'm the one who has the seven stars the seven spirits of God and we preached the denunciation how he said ah you have a name that you live us but our dead and we went through that on how this age labored in denomination for the RAM said if there was ever an age with denominational zeal it was this church age which is a sad thing so let's just go through this here will hopefully be done about an hour by God's grace revelation 3 verse 2 jesus said be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found that works perfect before God what a statement there that Jesus would tell the church age your works aren't perfect in other words they're not fulfilled what a statement we don't want Jesus to say that to us do we we don't want Jesus say that we want to do all the will of God that God has planned for us we don't want to fall short of that we want to do something for for the keen of God we want to know exactly what were to do praise God I am said I wish it could be said that the sardian age was a restoration instead of a rest rest grabs a Reformation but I cannot say that the word is not called a restoration but certainly calls it a Reformation had it been a restoration the age would have been another Pentecostal age but it was not the best that could be said of it was strengthen that which remains that is ready to die there was something missing ma yes there certainly was this age had justification but it missed sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm gonna say a little bit more on that in a little bit that's quite a statement to say that this age add justification but miss sanctification here's why that's a statement many of these men died for their faith I know Martin Luther didn't but many of the Reformers they gave their lives at the stake and yet Church it's hard to wrap our minds around this yet they weren't fully sanctified can you imagine that you could be a martyr burning the stake and not fully be sanctified that's quite a statement from the prophet of God but he's God's messenger to the hour and I will show you a few examples I will remind you of some of those examples so the Prophet says they had this age Sardis age had Reformation which was justification that means sanctification Wesley's age was also Reformation it wasn't a true restoration of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and so that's what we see here I think I got yeah I just have Martin Luther's life on there okay that's all I had oh do i Wesley - okay I'm looking at my slides okay then there's brother branham's okay so you have justification the Prophet said we wish we could say this was a restoration but Church the restoration is happening now amen it's happening right now how can you say that well I can say that because the gospel is still going to every nation and all those who receive it receive the full benefits of it praise God which we'll get to in just a little bit we want to share some things so referent justification sanctification under Philadelphia but now the true restoration is happening today and we can see that because brother Branham is industry was fully restored it had signs wonders miracles plus it had sacrifice it had character praise God and I also had godliness and it had everything his ministry had everything that the original Church age had praise God the st. Paul's Church age the fees and church age his ministry had all of it now it's trying to get that full ministry to the full Bride of Christ around the world that's what's happening now we're trying to get that full ministry to Akron to every USA every country must hear the gospel before Christ comes back amen and that's what's happening today by the grace of the Lord now the Prophet goes on to say that is what God's original plan was that is what they had at Pentecost they were justified they were sanctified and were filled with the Holy Ghost why listen to me the reason for being justified and sanctified is to the end that you might be baptized with the Holy Ghost that is the reason that there's a church it is the temple of God filled with God even the Holy Ghost the same spirit that was in Jesus while he was here on earth causing him to do the mighty works which he did came back up on the church of Pentecost so that they did the works that he did amen hallelujah this age should not have those works oh they had the written word now look at this but not the revealed Word aren't you glad you got the revealed word we've got the written and the revealed hallelujah oh my that's glorious this was the Reformation period but fear not little flock God said I'll restore and this reform was going to be the start of it he said he was going to according to his promise take the church back from the depth of Satan in the Dark Ages to the depth of God that they had at Pentecost and in the first few years of the six existence of the church Mendes statement Church I know there's not many of us here tonight but I hope we can understand this how tremendous of a statement this is we are supposed to have the depth of God they had in the book of Acts that's why brother branham said members dust saith the Lord the fullness of Pentecost will be in the bride and that's that's why we that's why we keep praying that's why I have a burden you know to keep praying and wanting to see more of God and preaching as hard as I can and living as close to God as I can because we're supposed to have a depth of God that goes beyond what Martin Luther had a mighty man of God Church a mighty man John Wesley who traveled hundreds of thousands of miles for the gospel brother Branham traveled hundreds of thousands maybe millions who knows but these men labored for the gospel and we're supposed to have that same depth that they had in the book of Acts my church that's just that's hot to me that's that's extremely humbling that my life should have the same depth they had and I want that life so I just added this word right here the death of God this is what we're talking about the depth of God and what did I do and I put that okay I put the same thing on there I'm sorry I didn't mean to put all those movements on there but the point was the depth of God back here was slowly lost right and then they had the depth of Satan right during the Middle Ages and then what's coming back to the depth of God and remember its restoration right its restoration so as we near closer to the rapture what's happening we should be getting closer to God we should see more signs like they saw at the beginning right so our as we approach there we should see more and more signs of what they had right here back at the beginning right more the truth of the word more sincerity more power more love right more revelation we should see these things by God's grace so does that help to see that this is the same death we had right here it started great here faded so great increase decrease increasing and this should be the full increase at the coming of the Lord now what is the depth of God number brother Branham told us he said it's Ephesians 3:18 the death of God is having Christ in us the hope of glory and remember when I preached on the love of God remember how I had four parts in Ephesians 3:18 it had a breath which was wide from east of the West it had length which was length of days days and generations it had depth which the Bible said was the depth of the wisdom of God and then it had height the Bible said God's love reaches to the heavens so remember wise virgins are wise to the will of God we're supposed to have the depth of God remember we're going back to the depth of God so the depth of God is the wisdom of God and that's what the Bible calls us wise virgins it's it's just absolutely perfect this Bible is sealed just so perfect if we got the Holy Spirit we can't make a mistake once at Amen because it's so it's so clear all this ties together the depth is the wisdom it's the with the with the will of God because remember Matthew 7 those who didn't do the will of God Jesus said I never knew you even though I had their miracles I never knew you because we must if we have the love of God we'll have the depth of the wisdom of God as well the will of God for our lives now I said be careful get this it says in the second verse that I read for I've not found thy works perfect before God do you know what the meaning of not perfect really is it is unfulfilled the age was an unfulfilled age it was just the start of getting back that is why said the Bible caught at Reformation not restoration it has started out in the doctrine of justification which meant salvation was all of God are you still thankful for justification glory my salvation is all of God praise the Lord now I'm almost getting to where I want to share a few things here okay Martin he's speaking of Martin Luther I skipped a few paragraphs here because I think we'd been over before he denounced the Pope it was wonderfully good as he started but God had said fifteen hundred years before he said Luther you are going to start things but your age will see it all unfulfilled I'm leaving that to the later amen hallelujah our God reigneth he knows the end from the beginning yes Luther was his messenger it didn't look like it as we examine the flaws and we'll get to the flaws in just a moment but there was a man called Jonah he had flaws in his life too he was a prophet you and I might not want to say so on the basis of how he acted remember he got really mad with God he got mad with God for being merciful to the Gentiles but God knows them that are his and he had his way just as did with Jonah he had his way with Luther that age and he will have his way until the consummation and then brother Graham tells the story of the Lutheran seminary out west that was seeking gifts remember that story brother Branham said that the seminary had a farm you know and the students would work on the farm at the seminary to make money for their tuition he said but the the president of the seminary found a book called the gifts of the Spirit and it's written by a man out of California he said we want the gifts of the Spirit so the president flew some students out with him to California and went to the author and said teach us about the gifts of the Spirit the man said we don't have them I just wrote a book on them jerk that's all we need we need not just to talk about him we need to have them praise God and I'm willing to wait because I know it's the promise of this hour but I don't know how God's gonna bring it to pass in other words I don't know if God's gonna raise up a nun another generation that will pray for the gifts of the Spirit or that that will make more dedication I don't know but one thing I know is God said he's gonna have the fullness of the Spirit in this bride and I just got to be willing to wait and I've got to be willing to sacrifice I've got to be willing to do my part to see more of God in the church so the point and then the the president called brother Branham and said brother Branham you didn't write a book on it but we've seen the gifts operate in your ministry and so brother they asked brother brother man says yes sir he said they do operate and so we asked brother Branham he's the brother branham we went the Holy Ghost he said do we have the Holy Ghost and mother Ram said potentially you have the Holy Ghost remember that and he said no what do you mean and brother have looked out at the field out there at their seminary and he said he said I'll give them an illustration they can understand remember that brother Ram said he said a man went out in a field one time and he planted all his corn and he said little tassels sprouted up and the man walked out in the in the the summertime Sun and said praise God for my field of corn and when I asked the president he said did the man have corn field yet and the price said well in one way he did and brother Ram said potentially he had corn he said that's you Lutheran's with the blade sprung up right not even knee Bhatt not even knee-high by the fourth of July just the blade sprung up not even the tassel brother Ram said and so here's the illustration brother Ram gives the blade had just sprung up but he told the Lutheran Church you're the blade right the tassel was Wesley brother Ram said then everybody thought it was Siva brother Ram said there's no there's another stage there's the chaff stage and he said the chaff stage protects the seed until it releases the seed and brother Ram said the Pentecostal church protected the message of the hour and then it pulled away and now we have seed time amen we're just a true seed of God is being preached to the people hey I love you all the Pentecostals traditions and men should be taken out and we should have just seed word being preached to the church it's exactly right and so it goes Luther Wesley Azusa message or Branham you could say I forget the name of the man who started that movement anybody remember I can't remember forgive me but I could have put his name on there but I forgot his name but just so you know I just wanted to put those up there it's the same thing I could put Branham and other guys name I forget his name he was we only had one I forget his name a black man really wonderful man I think he prayed six or eight hours a day before their revival six or eight hours a day that's a real soldier the cross now whatever it is and the way that it was done was by God's perfect will and programming the Lutheran's had the Holy Ghost potentially under justification the Methodists had a potential in a saint vacation and today has brought back a restoration the Holy Ghost is here now here's what I want to say I want to say this all along because this is if you really read Martin and the study Martin Luther's life like I just read the I just read the Britannica article that's a short article but there's journals of Martin Luther's life I mean he wrote journals and he this guy was a soldier of the cross but let me I just want to say this we're not exalting ourselves above Martin Luther or any reformer I just want you to know that many were martyrs and tireless workers and that can you say men we're not exalting ourselves they could only live as high as the word that they received right and we're not exalting ourselves but we have to live higher because more words been revealed to the books been revealed he had one revelation right basically one revelation did you know Martin I think you know this Martin Luther wrote that the Jews were guilty of crucifying Christ and it caused many Jews to be killed did you know that that's in the history of the Britannica he didn't have the fifth seal revelation because it wasn't time for the fifth seal you three revealed yet remember he started his words the peasants took his words and they started a peasant war and thousands of peasants were slain trying to destroy the government of that hour I don't remember which one it was and only it was wrong but anyways thousands lost their lives and brother bran picks that up in history and says see he was a mighty mighty man of God and when anointed but he made mistakes that sanctification would not have made and that's true but yet church there was many people that were mighty martyrs in that time but yet they couldn't live above now so how do you explain the I explained like this the Holy Ghost so anointed them in their justification in their minds that they were able to be a martyr for Christ but yet they made numerous mistakes that a sanctified person would not have made I've read a little bit now on John Wesley's life did you know there was whispers around him now I'm not saying anything bad about him but there's whispers about some some relationships he had outside of his wife that there may have been some were certain unfaithful relationship or something like that perhaps like flirting or something like that I don't know what but from what I've read and this is a guest well-known with those who are in the Wesleyan Church they're aware of this so I'm just letting you know these were mighty men of God when anointed but when that anointing left church they weren't sealed on the soul okay they weren't seen on the soul to live the full life like they ought to lived you know Martin Luther Jews diamond peasants dying but yet look at the labor Martin Luther wrote at least ten books how many books have I written none I wanted to start one this summer I didn't get done oh I told you that I want to get to it later but I've already got a good outline for it and whenever I get my videos done my revelation videos I want to move on to that ten books and church he translated the entire Bible into German of the Holy Spirit under justification I don't know if you knew this did you know this that brother Murphy Wang from China did you know this he translated the entire King James into Chinese and he's alive today he's a missionary today and he they're seeing such underground revival in China for the message Church we got modern-day Martin Luther's but listen he's living a holier life if you understand what I'm saying like he's got the seal the Holy Ghost where he don't cause people to die you understand he don't cause people to to be killed he don't put the hate on Jews you understand and did you know Martin Luther the rowdism Luther and the other reformers they drank alcohol and their missteps cost lives there was room for sanctification there's quotes you can pull up right on Martin Luther's websites you know people that follow him he would talk about if you want good sleep drink some beer before you go to bed and different things like that he like he was he was he just wasn't sanctified all the way now but yet many men like him wrote ten books say many souls I mean labored we'd say in many ways more than we do in many ways but yet the same thing with David he killed Goliath and killed all these men but then he killed a man and committed adultery with another man's life you see that's the power of the anointing you know that he had it was a powerful 90 but when it left he didn't have that seal there and so he did things that I'm born again person would not do praise the Lord everybody see that and we're not any better but we just have access to more power and glory and we will do all the works that God has ordained us to do right remember in Ephesians 2:10 all the of God were RT ordained and we just gotta walk in on my faith so we should expect our lives not to cause hate not to cause division that's to cause murders right not to cause flirting and and questionable relationships and things like that our lives should be so pure because we have a pure word Amen we have a greater word of Revelation that we have amen because like I said on Sunday on Sunday member on Sunday night we went over more about how the disciples had to be sanctified remember you and I I just placed myself I guess I'm this compared to Peter I'm lower than that I'm this compared to any of those apostles were nothing but God left us those examples in there so that we can examine ourselves and live a justified life a sanctified life and have the power of the Holy Spirit and be is adopted as we can whether brother Branham said he said you can be an adopted farmer I'm paraphrasing he said positionally placed he said you can be positioned place housewife you can be positionally placed doctor or farmer or a factory worker he said or preacher we can be positionally placed but our lives should be so pure we should have such a holiness our walk should say holy holy holy Lord God Almighty literally people should see our walk and they should literally sense just a holiness about our lives it should be so holy does that make sense those are the examples I want to give there because I just you know doing a quick quote search on Martin Luther and and I just saw more and more how how there's times with anointing left he needed sanctification in certain areas but I'm not saying like I'm not saying we're better I'm just saying more powers been given to us we should live a fully sanctified life and Holy Ghost filled life we should not cause murders like I said they're not should be should not be questions about our relationships and all these things our lives should look like Christ it should be the depth of God's love in our lives the depth of it the wisdom on how to follow the Lord Jesus Christ the depth of it because we're going back to the depth of God amen right we're going back to the beginning the depths of God I got a few more slides here let me go back to the second see how many I got I'm at 216 okay 2 4 6 10 12 14 you got time 16 18 20 22 24 I got 24 do we have time for 24 I don't know I forget he says okay if we can't rather I just did you know I don't wanna go maybe I should go a little faster but but I think you understand what I'm saying we're not exalting ourselves but we should be able to look at someone's life and say my and not in judgment but let's say judging ourselves we should never say my we should live a higher life err we should be able to see the power of God the power of God can help us live a little bit higher than that I mean or another word and sometimes a lot higher than that a lot higher than a lot of our friends and co-workers right and not to judge them but in church it ought to give us a pity a divine pity of love for their soul today I was uh I was praying over and weeping I was crying and pleading for some of the souls I set up a reunion for our state football championship team I set it up at the end of October and I'm inviting everybody and at the end I'm gonna have a guest speaker I'm working with some different people and I'm gonna try to at the end of my keynote event about how to be a champion in life because we're champions on football but who cares about football who cares anymore it's just nonsense but my whole point of doing this reunion was at the end so I can bring Christ to them and Church of God knows my heart I'm on my knees in my my closet this at this evening before church crying and weeping saying god save anyone on this I have this team picture on my phone save somebody on this team so that Souls don't go to hell we should have such a divine pity to win souls brother Graham said if you can't do nothing else he said win one soul to Christ praise God but have said the worst thing you can do is not try and do nothing we got to try to do something I'm willing to pour out myself there's gonna be a three-hour event I'm willing to pour out my money whatever I can do to try to give these guys one opportunity to hear one more time about Jesus Christ I never know if I ever have a chance again one of my teammates have already died he died actually shortly after high school he died at 21 years old from leukemia and so my heart's been burden lately I've been one just wanting to win souls I just want to see someone I just want to push somebody if all's they can be is a lot a foolish virgin then God help him to be foolish virgin praise God to be inversión to live all that they know with the Word of God so I want you to know I'm trying to everything I can to win any soul to the kingdom of God jesus said be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die now the idea is expressed in these two words watchful and strengthen are these here's the idea to watch contains not only the idea of being awake but to be alert to be otherwise insinuates danger and loss to strengthen means more than just to give strength it means to fix and establish for permanency I like that permanency don't you want to be a permanent Christian don't you want your testimony to be permanent well brother Jes gave up after 11 years of pastoring he just gave up no I want to be permanent by calling on God on to be a permanent fixture like the Bible said I love this the Bible said if you're a Holy Ghost overcomer you're a pillar in the house of God think about a pillar at the White House that pillar is hardly gonna move unless somebody like bombs the White House or something like that that is always going to be a foundational piece upon that that that at that temple right or we say we're infrastructure whatever it may be that building it's always gonna be a permanent fixture and that's what the that's what brother ham said that's what strengthen means we're gonna be so strong we have a permanent part with playing with God amen we play our part we keep our position we're a permanent part of the family of God these two commands refer to what is left of the truth which itself is ready or about to die this expression of the Spirit comes before me as an illustration so here's his illustration about these two watchful and strengthen here's so this is the condition next it's about slaves to just give you an idea this is the condition that Luther's Church Asia was in a group of slaves in total bondage physically and morally have risen up and escaped from their captors indeed that is what Sardis means the escaped ones they are pursued and their great and glorious gains are all but lost and we'll stop right there that's what Martin Luther's age was they'd escaped from slavery but they got Egyptians on their tails yeah I can never see that it's a perfect type right of Israel coming out of Egypt right water blood spirit Red Sea wilderness Promised Land right it's a perfect example they left the the world of the the false Egyptian Roman Catholic Church system Anglican all that they've left that but now they're being pursued and they're being chased after that's what the Prophet says that's his illustration slaves that are free but now they're being pursued they've not been retaken so Luther and them wasn't weren't retaken but about all that can be said is that they have escaped not clean escape that some were according to the word they had lost much of their liberties now the Lord says you are potentially back in captivity see that you don't go back that's what he's saying to Luther's age you're out of it but don't go back all right couple more here oh that is the right time okay okay yeah all right I got my time confuse to keep from going back become alert and remain ever watchful concerning the things of your captivity or you will lose all strengthen yourself now and what you have left in such a manner as to permanently establish what you have and thus ensure against future loss this will be your opportunity to fulfill what you have not fulfilled but did they go on program said no sir they did not heed to the voice of the Spirit and another age went into captivity and so God raised up others who would carry out his will let's stop right there did Luther go into captivity no member of RAM said it was the generation after praise the Lord it wasn't Luther himself it was a generation after that denominated around Luther wrote their Lutheran Creed's and their catechisms like my wife went through the Catechism and everything and the confirmation remember that a few more few weeks ago it wasn't Luther was the second generation after him but he still needed sanctify we saw that God bypassed a Lutheran denomination as he has all others and they never came back God had to go on in a new age bring further truth and a little more restoration now we have completed that's the end if you look in your church age book when you get a chance we that's that's the end of the warning so we've done the agent messenger salutation denunciation now we've done the warning next time Lord willing we'll move into the judgment but not tonight I just want to close with a few more thoughts here and then I'll close with these slides they go kind of quick because I just I'm gonna state important quotes from the 1960 Sardis sermon you'll probably notice a lot of these quotes are from the church age book but I but I listened to intently I listened to the 1960s sermon and I've tried to inject the most important thoughts okay and I tell you as you know that church age book is so faithful to the sermons almost every major thought in the sermon is in that church age book that's why we love the church age book alright so these are some important quotes so on verse 1 I'm gonna read verse 1 so you got it here's an important quote brother Branham picked up this really good thought I don't know if you saw this before but it's the use of the name of Jesus during the seven church ages did you check this thought it's interesting here it is it's it's verse one know thy works that thou has a name that now liveth and aren't dead that's from the Sardis church age chapter three verse one so the word name so brother Branham picks up the word name I don't know if you ever caught this this was a beautiful thought the use of the name of Jesus during the seven church ages look what brother Adam said this is from the sermon I got different text so you can see it's just to give your mind a difference it's from the sermon not the church age but well the RAM raises I know your works that was the name that they'll live us and our dead so we're gonna focus on the word name he said turn over the next church age you find out but thou hast not denied my name so did you got your Bible he's talking about did you have your Bibles or let me pull it up here Revelation 3:8 I'm sorry I just think it would make it a little more sense what part me make a little more sense if I show it on here Revelation 3:8 I can just do it here real quick I got everybody trained to look at the screen now so I usually tell you if I want you to take your Bible out so forgive me so he's talking about in the church age after Sardis which is Philadelphia then Jesus says this thou hast not denied my name okay so in Sardis he said you have a name that you live but you're dead okay which you're organized he's talking to the whole church age not Luther Luther was alive you don't forgot but there they lived a name but were dead and now in the Philadelphia Church age brother Branham said you've not denied my name let's go back to that quote it's an interesting thought I don't know if he caught it I thought was a beautiful thought see now the following church age Philadelphia you've not denied my name but in this church the Sardis you have a name watch here now here's where as it is he injects his thought here I have a slide for next this church kept his name but this church kept his name this church kept his name in this church went through a dark age and there was nothing said about it when they come out to the life on this side the first little escape one when Luther pulled them out you have a name that you're live but you're dead now now what name do they use after they quit using Jesus name father son Holy Ghost and there ain't no such a thing it's a dead it's a dead theology I'm thankful I buried all those three individuals in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I told him I said if you want me to say father only ghost I said I will I'll say this I'll say i baptize you name of the Father Son Holy Ghost which is the Lord Jesus Christ and they all said we'll just do Lord Jesus Christ so see these people are taught the Trinity Church and it's so sad they don't even know what it is but thank God we know what it is amen and when it's really presented without all their Creed's they can see it without a problem just like you and I that's all I got hope that maybe one of these families will come in the message I'm hoping I'm not prophesy I'm probably saying aha I said I'm saying you know I prayed for and I'm hoping I don't know but I believe if God placed me there surely someone wants the message and that city of I think there was 50,000 I'm not sure I have last time I checked it I did a I did a community evaluation on it one time when I was in graduate school but I can't remember not how many but maybe 50,000 maybe 30,000 somebody's gotta believe the message in there now here's the point brother I was talking about the name of Jesus Christ in the church ages if you look in chapter 2 verse 3 in Ephesus the Bible said you've had patience for my name's sake so Bella I'm saying they had the name of Jesus Christ in the first search age they used Lord Jesus Christ Lord Jesus Christ now in Samoa there's no mention you can look it up I looked it up I typed the name every time in the book of Revelation you're not going to find it in some urn in church ancient that means they were still using the name of Lord Jesus Christ Pergamos said thou holdest fast my name they still had the name of the Lord Jesus Christ dire tira there's no mention the 5th church age they had the name of Jesus but not the real life behind it right most of the age organized and so they were dead spiritually because they were had a name they live but weren't really alive to Christ now verse filled up on the Philadelphian church age you've not been not denied my name God started restoring the name of Jesus hallelujah and then there's no mention of the name in Laodicea remember there's overlapping so the program said Philadelphia's message overlaps to our age and so we have the name we've not denied the name of Jesus Christ glory alright now let me say let me see you next okay so in this quote you read the scripture again and then he basically rebukes the the Lutheran's he says he said what they do they put it right back in denomination again pot can't call kettle black so a Lutheran can't say oh you have horrible Catholic because they're doing the same thing they're both using Father Son Holy Ghost they're both using three God's the cut the pot can't call kettle black they're both black they're both using a false doctrine he said see cuz you're right back in it using the same Creed's and names and well Luther brought out many of the Catechism is everything else that the Catholic Church had and took up a name himself see they're both used in organizational names are both using the titles instead the name of Lord Jesus Christ well Ram said see you have an that you're living but you are come from this dead thousand years here and you're still holding that name you got a name remember to be sure that's right the other churches said you have kept my name you've kept my name in this age they lost it and come out here and said you've got another name you're living but you're dead does that make sense now you can see from Ephesus they had the name F system Pergamos had it higher tier didn't Sardis didn't they had to Crete they had titles and then Philadelphia had it Laodicea didn't but we know it carries over you know that does that make sense I thought wow what a striking revelation the name of Jesus Christ was starting being used and the church age - slowly was changed then it was changed the father only goes but now we have believers that have not denied his name today amen that's you and I and all the faithful Saints from Philadelphia on that have kept the name of Jesus Christ alright a couple more here oh I got plenty time verse two this is the thought I'm going to bring out in the quotes your works are complete or perfect if you're born again of the Holy Ghost in other words if you get born to the Holy Ghost if we're born of the Holy Ghost our lives will totally fulfill God's idea on what we were supposed to do right in other words we will do the will of God because those that are lost didn't do the will of God Jesus said I never knew you so anyone who has the Holy Ghost will be perfect before God they'll do everything God told them to do and David did all of that except for in the matter of Bathsheba remember the Bible said he said you kept all your will of God except in the matter of Uriah the Bible said that one time he got out of the will of God of course he made mistakes but the Bible recognized that was the one time he transgressed badly against the Lord so here's what Brad said remember that's not my idea I'm just saying what brother Brandon said okay I'll let you know if it's a maybe a fresh revelation I think I've received okay just like the Joshua of the seven nations that was other evidence say that that's a revelation I felt God gave to me I honestly do and I felt like it was backed up by the scripture ok brother BAM says I've not found your works perfect well Graham said you haven't come to perfection so under justification you're not quite perfect yet because we find out that they had justification right here justification he said I beg your pardon está case right on Luther and signed vacation is here and here's the Holy Spirit see now that three elements that worked in those three Church ages that's what it takes to constitute a full berth amen so he full birth is being perfect before God aren't you glad Church we can be perfect before God I decided I don't know what I can hardly contain myself to think that I can be perfect whereas Luther's age couldn't yet look at all they did but I also have to look at look at all they failed into because lacking the word not their fault just the age they lived in right just the age 11 because you and I we can only live as high as the word that's preached to us right I tell people all the time hoping they'll say well what do you preach I thought to the people I baptized they said why can't I get Victor of this and I said you can't live higher than you can preach alright I'm sorry that the people preach to you and I was hoping they'd say okay what do you preach but they didn't yet but I'm hoping they will I'm really hoping they will cause I don't want to be a proselyte I don't wanna proselyte people to our church I want people to come because they're drawn by the Holy Spirit like Amen was drawn here I never had to beg him to come he just kept coming back you know same thing with your whole family you know the whole ya yang family by God's grace I didn't we didn't beg anybody nobody had to beg me to come to church I came here because I heard something I never heard before and something inside of me said that's right and I'll forsake everything for the truth of the word of God amen that's I want to see in our day but by God's grace we can be perfect we can totally fulfill God's will we don't have to come up short if we have a full berth now here's the next thought brother Ram gives ok I think yeah I'm gonna go through this past the three works of grace were a restored beginning with Sardis age yeah we've I've just had a slide on this I must have did double slides forgive me so they're living a name that they're dead they were justified under Sardis right yeah I'm sorry I think this is a repeat yep I think I just added sorry John Wesley's sanctification brother Ram that's the Holy Ghost right does every know that I think that's a that's pretty simple there yeah I'm sorry I think I just wanted to show another slide on that so I did double slides I kind of repeated my time there so forgive me I know this might be the last one let's see here three three okay almost two four six okay almost there ten more okay this will go fast you and I escape the enemy I'm sorry yeah we and also Luthor's age we escape the enemy with the first work of sanctification remember picture Israel coming out of Egypt right picture them coming out of Egypt they escaped Pharaoh they escaped this the others taskmasters right and program says the same thing when you get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now reads the scripture he said holdfast your justification stick to it don't let them people stop that back away from you that also you've received you heard they read the same Bible we read see but they just didn't take all of it because it wasn't revealed to them it wasn't for their age see Luther can't help it he didn't have all the word like we have that's the reason they'll come forth in the resurrection they walked in the light they had to walk in so they'll come forth amen by Reformation I mean the escaped ones those that escaped even in the Sardis Church understand what I mean the escaped ones is one he's talking about they're right here this little bitty group here that's living by justification he said that's the one that does it see it's the second round that does okay I'm sorry this the one that denominated I don't know if I read this - you're not if I didn't forgive me now look they come out they seen the light Luthor turn right after the death of Luther not Luther that's what I was saying earlier Martin Luther didn't denominating organize it was the group after him Luther never made an organization it was a bunch after him Wesley never made no organization it was the group after him them founders of Pentecost never made an organization it was a group after them that's the one that does it see it's the second round that does it the real angel of light will never make an organization Amen I like that by God's grace so see we can't organize the member organizes just this organizers saying no more Holy Spirit I'm not going to give any more that's what organization is whenever someone says there's I can't take any more the Holy Ghost I don't you can't leave me any further into anything else they've organized so god help us to hear the voice of the Holy Spirit that's why I Church I'm listening every service I'm listen what the Holy Spirit is asking me to give up write or sacrifice or obey what more do I need obey I don't want to get a deaf ear to what the Holy Spirit saying we must come here to learn even if they're just for adults here tonight mercy I appreciate the faithful Saints you know but even if there's four I want to be able to hear what the spirit saying right and I got a couple more in verse brother that makes this statement this quote about chapter 3 verse 4 he said the few that they're talking about are the Holy Ghost filled believers the very few which we know little flock for not little flock let's read this quote he reads verse 4 there's worse for thou hast a few names I should have made that bowl and I actually wanted to make that boat now has a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy there was a few of them that still would not bow down to that thing and kept themselves pure and clean the trace from way back to Pentecost the spirit filled hallelujah a lot of them then when Luther's age begin to dominate what they do sorry right back in the Bible said acting like their mammy come right back down started a nomination but a few of them stood right out that they wouldn't do it they stayed right out for God so I hope that makes sense Luther was one of the Holy Ghost Pentecost Saints for his day does that make sense but they but he didn't have it in the soul right but he acted as close as anybody could act to one of those day of Pentecost and he he acted the closest they'd seen amen was Martin Luther praise the Lord because that was the life being restored it was the first part of life justification so he was the one that acted the closest to the day of Pentecost oh my hallelujah I love that he keeps going Jesus said well alright you got a few names they're worthy to walk before me dressed in white don't make a denomination don't take up the nickel Aiden doctor now don't start your denomination off again but just stay free and God let the Holy Spirit lead you as you go on there's a few of them still left a many want to be led by the Holy Spirit tonight that's Santa Fe I believe I made it I believe I made it by God's grace praise the Lord all right I still got 13 minutes left for an hour so Wow 47 minute sermon there praise the Lord you know Church I appreciate your patience with me I really and I was praying this to the Lord earlier today this is the most stressful time in my life that I remember I'm under I just feel like a load of pressure so please bear with me and I just hope I trust you know your faithfulness tonight I trust I trust God's blessed you I'm given as much as I can to the Lord as I possibly can and these things this church age book is a glorious book amen for example like don't you want to do don't we want to be the few that walk in white like all these things still relate to us today but the truth is we have more power available to us today because we have more the word so I just want to close right there yeah that's I'm all preached out of all so that's all that's all my notes there I got a lot enough to get back to where I was all caught up to my notes there by the grace of God smack I can switch over to the songs here by God's grace let me switch over here gibberish okay so I will just sing a song here me just misses anybody have any prayer requests as we close do you might think of anything let's bow our heads we'll just pray here's where dismissed let's pray for this event I told you I set up a bed for October 28th I'm inviting all hundred people to come back and have a reunion with us I'm trying to set it up so they can hear a gospel sermon at the end I just really I felt learn to do this I really feel the leadership so if you look great for that as we close it there was something else we could pray for but that's just our heads here I'm sorry okay Heavenly Father Lord we love you tonight Lord we just want to be like you nor these sermons are so important we don't want to nominate I don't want to say no Holy Spirit you can't leave me any further Lord I want to be led further I want to know what it's like to grow deeper in love with you dear God for we are going back to the depth of God it's thus saith the Holy Spirit Lord teach us to be more wise teach us the Lord have the depth of love in our lives where we'll continue to hear your voice every service nor every day in our homes we'll get on our knees and pray dear God Lord I'm so humbled in my heart Lord so look at Martin Luther to think I can have hired the partner they're like Lord I just feel so little dear God I feel so unworthy of a man who wrote ten books who had the courage to nail a paper with 95 complaints of the Roman Catholic Church on a church nor who stood before trials oppose God what a mighty man you made him dear Lord I feel so irrelevant compared to that man dear Norma but yet Lord I know what the word says I know what history says about his life but I just want to say this own live all the word that's revealed to this age I don't want to cause any hatred toward Jews or black or white or any race more than lunch cause any painter and Lord against the government I just want to cause hatred against sin dear Lord I want to cause the love for the word of God I just want to see so sane I just want to do what you are dating my humble little life to do going to God so insignificant compared to Martin Luther John Wesley John Calvin John Wickliffe who died at the stake burned as a martyr to understand some of these things how it could be that we can live a more holy ghost in life than men like that I can't understand it but it seems nor that according to your prophet Lord more of the Spirit of God has given person the soul today we could be fully sealed or the word can get into our soul the Holy Ghost can get into our soul give us the quickening power my god we can clearly see how David mister as the mighty of a man as he is we can clearly see that murder adultery Lord would not be pleasing in the New Testament or ever Lord God but especially in this hour it not be pleasing to a Holy Ghost filled Saint they couldn't do it North because Satan sealed out little God father I'm just humbled by this message tonight or not because I've preached it nothing you're no record I know that but just Lord reading these things Lord and pondering them thinking about the amazing sacrifices and these men have made Lord so I say a prayer for myself and for our church that you'll lead us Lord to do your perfect will for our lives or it may just be living pure a virgin pure life or spiritually Lord God we may not write books I know that everybody's an officer we may not raise the dead all of us Lord not everyone's an apostle but Lord we do want to do all your will for our lives every time that's my prayer Jesus tonight it makes me cry thinking about this I feel so insignificant Lorne I feel like that's your problem prayed at 53 years old he said I feel like I've done nothing for God Norda 30 he write about 36 I feel like I'm prayed the same thing I've done nothing for you Jesus I just would do something for me dear God I just want to win some souls Lord I just want to see the book of Acts church and Akron Lord God if it be your will I know what the prophecy is I know what the Bible says would you grant it to us Lord Jesus I pray help me the humble myself lord help us all go home with ourselves I feel like you see our sincerity tonight Lord God I love you Lord Jesus we just want to be sincere before you and we want to be faithful to the word dear God you want the depth of God we want the restoration I don't want a Reformation I want the restoration of the book of Acts dear God I'll continue to believe it okay did you know thank you for it Lord willing to wait 25 years I got 11 under my belt dear God I think before the Apostolic things we have seen Lord I do believe there's more you believe there's more for us Lord God as your prophet said we've seen apostolic times in perfect faith he said but we want to see more of it and I'll keep asking for that because I want to see more so today I want to see a church that sinners or sit Canyon and come in like Peter and Ananias and Sapphira I want to see that girl or God I want to see Lord I want to see like the day of Pentecost Lord where people shouting and praising God and people so hungry for they say what is this manna what is this and Lord somebody stand up and say this is that which Joel spoke of hallelujah the prophesy from the bride and I'm wanting to cry for that money to pray for that Lord I'm willing to plead with you will need to wrestle it out of the prayer like Jacob wrestling about with the angel give me strength to be able to wrestle it out of your God all of us Lord God these faithful Saints here tonight less than the Lord God they want to wrestle doubt they've had the strength and they had the opportunity to come here tonight may they dress without me I wrestle it out Lord may give us our hearts desire nor God to be wise virgins with the death of your love and to have a real relationship with you Lord all the days of our life your God as we close here near God bless our last closing song father I know you've heard my prayers help me just to be faithful to keep asking and keep believing and keep knocking Lord God as that one who did with the unjust judge you said shall I find faith in other words shall I buy revelation of the earth when I return Oh God he was more revelation of your word dear God what we should do Lord according to thy word dear Lord you said this Lord your prophet said that the move is on the bride thus saith the lord help us define our movement that we should do help us all Lord God if we found it help us to keep doing it Speight as we can I'll give you the glory in Jesus Christ now the church said Amen praise God let's just sing one more song here as we're just miss the graces of Lord here today let's think about how he loves you then you listen how many love the Lord I just want to please Jesus Christ all I want to do only one of those few that walk worthy and like [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] let's go through that mission keep singing [Music] [Applause] [Music]
