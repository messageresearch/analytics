a man let's take our Bibles let's get into the Word of God this morning by the grace of the Lord appreciate everybody pressing their way out to the house of Lord I know it's snowy out there and I know it's very very cold but we appreciate the desire to come to the house and Lord you know that song is a reality as the deer pants for the water that's how we pant for the word we need the word that much how we need to wear that much by God's grace absolutely so we're grateful let's go to Revelation chapter 3 let's go to verse 10 here by the grace of the Lord like to I think if the Lord is willing I'll finish the Philadelphia Church age this morning if the Lord is willing so look at that here actually is got a revelation on 312 pardon me 312 amen I do apologize you know this morning I came out everybody about Darrell Ward not being here so I'm sorry I actually knew that on Thursday I just forgot to let everybody know so forgive me I wanted to let everybody know sooner I just forgot Thursday was a crazy busy day and I just forgot to let everybody know so pardon me we rescheduled for March 11th so we're looking forward to our brother coming March 11th and he said well Jesse said I've been on the the field for 27 years he said we can switch it out with another weekend with another minister so he switched it out and now he's out in Arizona you know so they just got all the good weather you know but anyways we're grateful and I just don't want to put the brother in harm's way you know on Wednesday night I prayed for wisdom and I just said I'm just gonna put in your hands and I just waited I was waiting for the latest forecast and then at then brother Darrell just you know said well I'll just reschedule you know so I let I just let God make the decision but ultimately he made the decision so I felt like that was just wait I was just waiting on the Lord and try to let God have his way so revelation 3:12 although just gave it only wrong I'm very disappointed I wish he could be here because I know he's got a wonderful ministry revelation 3:12 at the same time I'm happy to be with all of you by God's grace so thankful this evening uh while your turn there yesterday I just read this whole book yesterday it's on Christian modesty it's only like fifty some pages I'm sorry seventy four pages I just read that and then I bought this one the roaring 20s so I'm gonna preach on modesty and I've kind of been working on my book I finished chapter three this week and so my mind just kind of been in there so I'll probably just show you maybe some things you never knew before and go over some scriptures there's been a few scriptures have been very helpful with Christian modesty and there's some pictures I might take pictures of and show them to you like women in Chicago getting arrested for wearing shorts in 1922 they got arrested and the cops are like and they're fighting and their poll of them trying to get into the the wagon or whatever they call though they call it the paddy wagon haven't they caught it back there just for wearing shorts and looking just a matter of you know a hundred years look look how look how this society has been become degraded it used to be imprison a ball and now it's acceptable so I just want to review some of those things because that's what my Bert My Mind's on I got a burden for that right now I want to get that out to anyone who needs it and I know you know I know in these labors you know these YouTube Labor's and things were trying to get out the message I know it's of God because we've had so many testimonies and I've recently had somebody tell me brother Jesse they said every single video did speaks to my heart I felt that's that's perfect because I have two witnesses every sin every video we made speaks to my heart and so it speaks to other believers heart the the word will always speak to your heart at a man a 70 72 year old preacher called me this week and he said brother Jeff's Pastor Jesse he's I just want to tell you about your serpents evideo and I thought oh boy here it comes I'm gonna get it he said that was amazing so I said brother thank you for that encouragement I don't get many calls like that like last week I had six minutes long of voicemails bawl me out for the Godhead you know but I said I'm got back to that guy got back to him a couple times but anyway I just want to give you a little update there revelation 3:12 will try to finish this this morning him that overcometh will i make a pillar and the temple of my god and he shall go out I'm sorry go no more out now write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and I will write upon him my new name he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches Amen if you need on your heart just make it known unto God why don't we have one more word of Prayer have any father you see the needs on the hearts of the people just lord I just prayed you what you did on Wednesday Lord speak to the hearts of every person no God meet every need Lord Jesus may our hearts hunger and thirst for you may we be like deer panting for the waters of the Spirit Lord speak to us Lord I know you're in control ultimately Lord and I you myself now Lord just help me be a willing vessel to say whatever you would have be said to your people Lord God we believe there's bride members sitting here Lord God so Laura let your word flow out to your wife Lord the one you're engaged to Lord the one that you will not be ashamed to have sit by you on your throne dear God and serve you day and night in the temple Lord God we give you glory Lord speak to us now Lord thank you God for every blessing help us not to forget or those that are struggling as we said with cancer Lord different ones struggling help us to never forget them lord help us to pray constantly Lord and we give you the glory in Jesus Christ's name in every said Amen god bless you to be in seat of their praise god sounds like we're getting some plowing out there praise God amen so you can switch over Malachi when you're ready or just do a little bit teaching here I think we'll finish the Philadelphia Church age this morning all right so we're looking at the Philadelphia Church age and I got my count mixed up last time and this is part 52 today I got my count mixed up I was one off I was I said on Wednesday was 52 but this is actually 52 I went back to check so our series progression we've spent a lot more time on Philadelphia than any other Church age so I had five on emphasis eight on Simona five on pergamo seven on thirty or nine on Sardis and 13 on Philadelphia and Laodicea we did five back in 2015 praise God I think you'll be blessed this morning I think it'd be a real strength to your heart I won't look at the name of my god in the name of the city of my god as the prophet teaches us here in the scripture or here I'm sorry in the church age book par me he quotes the scripture and then I want you to note here that these are the rewards for the overcomer and it's a reward for God to write his name upon the overcomer now how many know that the Holy Spirit is writing his word upon our hearts right now how many know that currently right now the passo Paul says in 2nd Corinthians 3 that the Holy Spirit is writing the word upon our hearts but the Bible says one day he's gonna write our new name upon us now I don't know I haven't I don't haven't got the revelation of this one but I just want let you know there's two were different writings there's the writing of the word on your soul and there's gonna be a future writing upon the bride so I imagine it might be writing on the book of or the Lamb's Book of Life or or some type of some type of writing we're not quite sure but we know there will be a writing it'll be the name the Bible said of God the name of the city of my god which is New Jerusalem and the new name the new name of Jesus praise God now remember Church its reward so if you can overcome you get the reward of his name Amen and remember you're rewarded because you're worthy not of your flesh we know the flesh will never be worthy enough how many know that when Paul was talking about self-denial how many know that Paul was talking about a boxer remember that first good news 9 he said I have to beat my body and bring it under subjection so the illustration is that Apostle Paul stepped inside the ring can you get the picture of a boxer in your mind I know Kevin used to box you remember going through the ropes brother Kevin into the ring and brought them st. Paul's like every day I've got to crawl through the ropes and get ready to fight my opponent get all warmed up you know hit the bag a little bit before you jump in there you know maybe do the bag my mind goes the rocky because I watched those you know worldly videos but Paul said every day I step into the ring against Paul can you believe that that's that's the illustration he gives and we and we know you're fighting against yourself you are your own worst enemy we know we know that from the prophets message so you've got to defeat yourself and if you can defeat yourself you get a reward remember what was Satan's plan always Satan's plan was to make Adam and Eve think they were gods right it was to make them think that they were gods and that their thoughts could be exalted above the Word of God that was his thought surely God won't let you die say surely there's a different interpretation to the message of the hour surely everybody's going to be alright and surely everybody's going to be save and surely they're not surely if you eat of that fruit you shall die so Satan tries to exalt them to think oh if you can just compromise a little bit on the word you'll be you'll be as God you'll be you'll be more spiritual but no we're actually more spiritual when we just obey the plain humble Word of God amen we are more spiritual if we can just listen to Jesus amen just do what Jesus said and we get rewarded hallelujah you're rewarded because you're worthy and brother BAM said it's because you walk with Him on earth and if you walk with Him on earth he'll walk with you in the new earth amen the new earth and I'm pulling this from of course from the Sardis and church age the only way we could get a reward and a new name is if we're worthy of that name and to be worthy you just have to walk in the footprints of Christ remember this he said they shall walk with me this is what God says he'll bestow upon them that for this upright walk this is part of their inheritance that he's reserved for them if they were willing to walk with him through the toils and snares of life and be an honor to him he was going to reward them how many been through toils in their life only been through his traps where Satan tried to trap you into some sin he tried to say like this he tried to chop you into a negative attitude he tried to trap you into disobedience to the word he tried to trap you into lust of the flesh or pride of life or lust of the eyes he tried to trap you but thank God for that song amazing grace through many dangers toils and snares I have already come I didn't stay in the snare I came out of the snare amen if you're willing to walk with them through the toils and snares of life then he'll walk with you the Bible said he's not forgetful of our labor of love God will always recompense us for our efforts to please him he'll always pay us back how many are witness of that whenever you give to others it'll be given back to you how many can say Amen whatever you've given because God loves a cheerful Giver we must give our time let's give our attention give our finances give our food give our clothes we must give whatever we have away give and it shall be given unto you the unchangeable law of God Amen that's what God's that's what God tells us he's not forgetful to forget our labor of love yes they've walk through the world and had not partake and I remember that story the sheep we told her brother branham he was in a European country he saw the Shepherd gonna lead us his sheep through the market and he said oh boy here comes a big stampede all those sheep are gonna jump on the tables because the food's out on the tables and brother have said to my amazement the Sheep just follow the shepherd they walked through the market and they didn't partake of all the food that was laying right before their hungry mouths and that's because they were obedient to the shepherd and we must be obedient to the great Shepherd the Shepherd of your soul the Lord Jesus Christ we must not partake of it we're going to walk right by it we're gonna walk right by you know and any sin you can name out there on the table that say of Satan's table you're gonna walk by every temptations or your life the older you get the more temptations there are right the greater temptations there are and so we've got to be able to look past that and not get not get our spiritual noses sniffing into the things of the world we must not flirt Amen Church not even flirt don't even stop for a second remember don't stop for one second don't even start entertaining that thought in your mind because remember the first fruit that Eve partook of was the fruit of lies and then she partook of the fruit of adultery after that that's right that's the Word of God she first received that that seed of a lie and that's the first fruit she actually partook of and then the fruit of adultery came later and then she received the the wrong seed we know that so we must make sure we remember that God's Word is above all of our thoughts amen do not partake of anything amen of the world they'd not let the world systems overcome them when the illustrious names of that age had yielded to the banishment of the state and chosen political mindedness rather than spiritual - and were on their way back into the world these few stood for the word of God and thereby honor the Lord hallelujah now he would honor them in return yeah praise God we've got to honor him here and it'll honor us there amen for they shall walk with him in white they'd identify them with him on earth and now he would identify himself with them in the New Jerusalem and how marvelous will be that identification and so I pulled this out of Samuel which you're familiar with I'm sorry I got a typo I just saw that samuli Samuel II it's actually Samuel now the Bible said God was rebuking elide he said why do you kick at my sacrifice in my offering which I've commanded my habitation and you honor your son's above me to make yourselves fat with the cheapest of all the offerings of Israel my people so Eli was letting his sons sin in the service of the Lord they were eating fat from the from the the burnt offerings I'm so not the burnt offering from the sin offering the burnt offering was completely burned to God but they would take in the fat belong to God but they would take that fat and they would they would have the first choice once the sacrifice was rightly divided they would take things that belong to God and Eli let it go on and then he would sleep they would sleep with women and commit adultery on their wives and there was no correction the house of God God's house must be a house of correction even the littlest things a full wrong Lord show us were wrong that we can get right and honor you because if we don't care take care of that little 11 it 11 your whole life that's exactly right wherefore the Lord God of Israel saith I said indeed that thy house and the house of thy father should walk before me forever but now the Lord sayeth be it far from me for them that honor me I will honor and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed amen it's the law of God if you honor God God will honor you praise the Lord if people speak evil of you just honor God because pretty soon they're gonna say something nice about you I've seen with my own family when I first came in the message they said you're of the devil you know this is leaning of the devil and then I told that story where my mom sent me a letter you know she was saying first of all she thought we're of the devil and then I sent her something in the mail as a love offering and she wrote me back and said she said your church she said truly is the true Church of God before she was saying it was the Church of the devil and now because of love and because of constant application of love now she can recognize it's the true Church of God amen that's a witness to me if you honor God God will honor you hallelujah it's exactly right the Prophet said it makes me rejoice he says and yet makes me weep to think of the consolation or condescension for you will note that he is not dressed in another different color from the Saints as earthly nude leaders would so do know they are like him he's like them they are like him even as John said for they see him as he is amen the RAM said for they are worthy do you realize who is saying this it is Jesus the worthy one himself this is the only one who is a kind of worthy to take the book out of the hand of him who sits upon the throne and now this worthy one is saying to his Saints you are worthy here is this one the only one qualified to judge and indeed all judgment is committed unto him and he says you are worthy we must walk with Him how many want to walk with him to walk with that means you must honor him and honor his word for they are worthy and then the Prophet gives the way translation in other words Romans 8:33 says God says I'm righteous the King James says who shall a which means accuse who shall accuse anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifies there is why there in the white light of God's righteousness hear the sweet voice of Jesus as he says these are mine they're righteous they're worthy they shall walk with me in life how many grateful that they have someone to walk through through the toils and snares of life I'm grateful I have just more than my wife I appreciate my wife I appreciate all you all being here throughout my toils and snares but really the one we've got to walk with is Jesus Christ and if we walk with Him that means when we go home and our prayer closets or when the the trials of life drive us to our knees that we ultimately look to Christ for strength we look to the word for guidance we look to the word for wisdom are we going to choose the word or choose a compromise on the word we must choose the Word of God then we're walking worthy then we're honoring the Lord amen hallelujah and I'll write upon him the name of my God in the name of the city of my god well Graham said to what is the name of God well he was God with us or Immanuel but that was not his given name thou shalt call his name Jesus jesus said I came to my father's name and you receive me not therefore the name of God is Jesus for that is the name he came in he is Lord Jesus Christ and what name does a woman take when she marries the man she takes his name it will be his name that is given unto the bride when he takes her to himself and the prophet quotes revelation 21:1 through for this the prophet said this is when he takes her to herself at the future home where they have their own home and I saw a new heaven and new earth for the first heaven the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband so this city is like the bride because this city has been brought from Evan to earth just as Rebecca was brought to Isaac Amen Hanukkah the cities like the bride being brought escorted to the husband Amen it's a city that's adorned prepared as a bride for her husband and I heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes so the look church even at the future home will still be crying will still be crying we'll be able to cry at the wedding supper remember will wipe tears away from our eyes there the scripture says maybe the Armageddon I'll know if we'll cry there not we'll cry here when the future home comes down and we're standing there with Jesus I imagine Jesus will turn a look at our look at his wife and say I prepared you our mansion I went away and I remember like he said in John 14 he said he said I would have told you so right I would have if I was going to go prepare a place I would have told you so and I went to repair your home here here's your home now here's the keys to your home I didn't hear you praise God here's your future home amen and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes can you imagine walking not you see it you see a perversion of it today where you know celebrities will buy people a new home right or they'll give them a new car and they'll start crying oh yeah they cried and and and they're so happy but you know what that home after 10 years it gets pretty dirty doesn't it that car you know we got our car two years ago it's pretty dirty now I try to keep it clean but you know the newness of it wears off and those people you know if they live long enough cars gonna get old it's gonna break down Oprah bought everybody car remember that one show I never watch it by selling the news she put a car a car key under every seat and all the girls scream god I got a new car and they're so excited about a car that's going to break down some of them are going to get in car accidents and total their car and they're excited about that and so those are tears we'd say of just perversion because the real home is going to being real tears - the life of Jesus Christ that's something worth crying about amen is the future home that Christ went to repair to your liking amen amen glory we don't cry overnight I mean natural things might help it might shed a few tears over things like that but the real whole work of the cry about is the future home amen the home that Christ Himself constructed hallelujah exactly right there should be no more death see there has to be the white throne judgment first where where all the demons and the unbelievers the goats are cast and death happens death has to happen separation has to happen but once the future home there is no more death amen neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away so this is the last point of Tears as far as we can see in the scripture now there may be afterwards now I do have to apologize I made a mistake I preached on Wednesday and I said that there will be no more Sun in the future home and that's wrong the Bible doesn't actually say that the Bible said they'll have no need of the Sun so forgive me on that I preach something wrong so I caught I caught myself saying it and I wanted to stop and check it but I just kind of moved on but I didn't make a mistake there the Bible never said there'll be no Sun it just says there's no need of the Sun so there may be a Sun there I imagine the people that aren't in the future home the nations around the earth if we get a picture a global picture in our mind here if we look at the earth and there's nations scattered abroad the earth you want to bring their glory and honor to the future home I imagine you know if the world keeps turning they're gonna need a Sun but those that are in the future home have no need of the Sun because they're living close to Jesus and he is the light of the world amen they won't have need for the bride they have no need for the light because their dwelling with Christ now I want you to notice here God Himself is mentioned in revelation 21:3 God Himself is mentioned a part of reading revelation 21 and 22 we see that the lamb and the Lord God Almighty are mentioned and notice it's an ants this is where Trinitarians might stumble and I saw no temple therein for those Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the temple of it so see Trinitarians look at this verse and they see two people I don't know where their third is though they're because you won't find the third in Revelation 21 22 you won't find a dove and then an old man and a young man you won't find that so see there's no mentions of separate persons or separate Thrones so we must look to further witnesses to understand it now the Bible does say and the spirit and the bride say come but there's no mention of a physical dove flying around you know hovering over the Sun or anything like that and so we understand that the Bible says no man can ever see God God is the invisible spirit we will never see God the Father for he is invisible spirit the Holy Spirit brother BAM talks about and says God is a spirit yes how many understands that God's a spirit Jesus is a man and Jesus was God made flesh we could never see God he's a spirit you can't see spirit no man has seen God at any time now the Bible says who Jesus is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature amen Saint John wrote twice no man has seen God at any time he said that he quotes it verbatim twice no man has seen God at any time so see the God whom no man has seen or can see as is the Lord God Almighty so see the lamb is the image of the Lord God Almighty in Revelation 21 22 now some people stumble over this Jacob said I've seen God face to face as they say oh I can see God face to face but you failed II read the rest of the scripture the Bible said he had power over the angel and prevailed he never saw God the Father face-to-face he saw an angel face-to-face understand what we're talking about Jacob wrestled a manifestation of God it was God we'd say in a form of an angel or a form of God or an angel of God but the Bible said no man can see God and live with me praise God he himself will live with us in that heavenly City and it won't be two persons it certainly won't be three persons we will see just the Lamb of God amen he is the image of the invisible God but see people stumble remember God laid it in there because people who wanna stumble they need something to stumble over to the summer over Trinity they'll stumble over sin they'll stumble over this though some over that they got to have something to stumble over so God leaves that there in the scripture so he saw a manifestation of God face-to-face praise God finished revelation 22 and there shall be no more curse but the throne of God and of the Lamb so see the lamb is the image of God shall be in it and his servants shall serve Him and they shall see look at this his face not faces and his name shall be in their foreheads to see God in the lamb share one throne there's not a mention of two Thrones it's one throne his face is singular his name is singular the throne of God is singular that's because God is one singular person amen now after reading the future home brother band said how wonderful all of God's wonderful promises fulfilled it will be all over the change will have been completed the lamb and his bride forever settled in all the perfections of God talk about a settling think about the settlers that moved out lesson and they got the West settled thinking about you if you have a home and you got to settle your home and knock down the woods and you get settled what a nice feeling is to move in and be settled in your new place right how many like to feel settled you and I will not feel settled until that city lands upon that Jerusalem area and we move in with our heavenly bridegroom amen that's what we're finally gonna feel with settled praise God amen we can move on it feels like everything's perfect well you can get settled in the future home praise God can you describe it by Jesse no who's able to do that nobody not even brother Brandon think about it dream about it read what the word says about it yes we can do all of that yet we can only know and infant is amol I don't even know if I'm saying that right part of it just a small part of it until it becomes a reality in the first resurrection so once the rapture happens we finally get a reality of what this perfection is going to be like it won't be complete but we'll have a will have another taste of the change that God is bringing to this world and this universe oh my the perfections of God become a reality in the first resurrection or the rapture this is because death is swallowed up in victory our dying bodies are slowed up by eternal bodies we experience a part of the change but there's more change to come for the earth because the Bible says the moments when command-i we shall all be changed amen and the Bible says in second Corinthians 5 for we know that if our earthly house of this Tabernacle beat us off we have a building of God a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens for in this we groan are you groaning for a perfect body are you groaning to be perfect you have to be Paul was groaning for it are we groaning for more pleasures of the earth we ought to be groaning for that future home we ought to be groaning for a perfect body we ought to be groaning for victory over yourself we ought to be groaning for that that's a policy we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house he said which is from heaven now remember once you get your new body it's eternal even in a perfect glorified body we can cry and also eat like Jesus at the Raps remember we get a combination of three bodies the glorified the celestial and the theophany or the terrestrial they caught all three arm unite to come one because life the glorified swallows up the regular body aim and the earthly body and so see emotions are still part of the human spirit and our human spirit remains intact to some degree because we're still able to cry with brand-new bodies were able to eat weren't able to do all these things we're gonna remain human praise God the only thing that's going to change is our bodies but we're taking our character with us amen I'm still going to be a pastor over there as far as a preacher you're still going to be a faithful a woman or a faithful man or whatever God's called you to be whatever you are here that's what you'll be an eternity amen it's just that all of the death is swallowed up in life and at the rapture we'll have the first taste of perfection but we won't feel complete until that city comes out and we feel settled in our home amen you know I won't feel complete we won't have the name written on us of the new heavenly City we won't have that yet Christ hasn't revealed that yet he hasn't revealed his new name yet he hasn't revealed these things that's why we feel unsettled because we know there's prophecy still to be filled amen we know there's a name that we're still going to be called by whereas that we desire to be called by the new name of Jesus amen Oh hallelujah now this is where Jesus says my new name and I'll write my new name upon him my new name when all becomes new when he will take upon him a new name and that name will be the name of the bride also what the name is none dare conjecture so a church it's not even worth our time trying to figure it out I don't want to hear your guesses about what the new name is I don't care because none dare to conjecture that see we were many times people in the message you know we try to be as spiritual as brother branham right because we know more about prophets and if we're not careful sometimes we try to inch our way and to be more spiritual we make ourselves Mystics mysterious let's just be honest if we don't know let's just say we don't know but see the reality of it is how many people come out when they really say I got the state the Lord then it comes to pass that's real spiritual activity right there when you can prophesy when you say you've got the state the Lord it comes to pass now you're getting real spiritual now that's real that's real discernment of the sphere we'd say but let's not try to be a mystical that's where all the churches get off when they try to figure something out before it's God's time to reveal it let's not try to inject ourselves let's not try to presume and try to figure something out that God hasn't revealed to it let's just wait upon the Lord as we said on Wednesday how many got plenty of patience Noah had plenty of 120 years of patience I could wait a few more years for the new name I'll have to try to figure that out I'm gonna try to figure out the seven thunders like other brothers have done and led people astray right now we know what the seven thunders are but we know the other group that went to New York and I'm not going to name names but we know that grew had the wrong interpretation how do you know look at their fruits at the end they were worshipping the man who started the movement they listened to his tapes only not brother branham and there was prophecy saying up that he would rise from again from the dead three days later he did it his sons got arrested and the brothers the pastor's there in North Carolina saw on TV saw the Internet they got arrested for money embezzlement adulteries in the church see the fruit of it show what was behind that revelation praise God the fruit of it the fruit of our lives should say holiness the fruit of our I should say godliness amen the fruit of our lives should say faithfulness to the Word of God amen but we don't try to inject something into it make it Marcel's more spiritual or more mystic or more mysterious let's just be solid sound stable settled Christians amen let's just be so grounded in the truth and every day we're a Holy Ghost field child of God we laws we know is that we love Jesus more and more every day praise God amen none day or make a guest about the new name don't even dare you know I know people they have said you know Lord Branham Christ they've done stuff like that I've heard that online i've i've seen the websites online they say that's the new name shame on them that's false doctrine isn't awful it's awful some of the brothers like brother Devon Karen he knew people that were baptized the name of William Marion Branham it's awful you see what it is they're trying to inject something they're trying to be spiritual when they're not praise the Lord but whose spiritual those who fear that God and keep his commands you want to be more spiritual start being more fearful of God start recognizing more sin around you that you can cast it down and live above it be a king on this earth reign over sin in your life go into the boxing ring every day and defeat your flesh that's how you're a real spiritual person remember spiritual meat belongs to those who what they do they have discernment they can discern good and evil corny Hebrews chapter five remember that that is somebody who's ready for me preaching I was preaching that at the middle school a Bible Club and I said that's why I said I said me preaching is when you can discern is this of God or not and a boy raised and said but mr. Smith he said his Star Wars of God I said let your I said talk to her mom about that because I know his dad passed away but I said dr. mom about that but I said if you want his name was Luke I said you if you want Luke we can do a lesson on that and real spiritual maturity it examines everything in your life to see it's of God or not I love that phrase god I love it so even even a child he's in fifth grade even a child can understand this thing if this message is so simple what is it it's just back to the word it's the word though and I read this book yesterday on modesty and I was so blessed by but church this book has a lot less scripture than I have in my book already and not that not that I'm exalting you know my mind it may never get the print I don't know I hope it does but I'm just saying like we have so much more word because God has restored the word back to us I was just I was blessed by what I saw but I was also concerned they're so little there it's more just thoughts and and history and idea which is fine if it lines up with the word but we should be able to dig down in the word and find more a word that we can prove the faith by amen the Bible said have an answer for every man who asks for the hope of God within you be ready to give an answer sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and be always ready to give an answer for the hope you have within you that's why I did those videos if someone three times this week people from overseas from satu from South Africa said well Jessie what do you feel about the Holy Ghost what do you feel about this and I just said them links to my YouTube video I don't have time to sit there and talk to them for thirty minutes about it but I can point with that so those videos have taught me that that's a nice way to have an answer just real briefly I can give to somebody always have an answer what is evidence of the Holy Ghost what is this what what is the three works of grace how do you know where the man was a prophet so if I don't have time I can say right there it is that's our answer with meekness and in fear glory it would have to be a revelation of the spirit of the new name given so conclusively that none would dare even deny it so no one can guess and then no one will deny it in other words God will reveal it to the bride and every bride member will believe it praise God but no bride member is gonna guess at it amen no bride member will guess but every bride member will receive the new name of Jesus amen but no doubt he'll leave that revelation to the day when he desires to give that name forth it's up to him suffice it to know that it will be more wonderful than we could ever imagine look at that new name me don't even think about it don't try to conjecture don't try to inject your own thought that's what Eve did injecting her own thought of course it was Satan's thought first we know that now did you know he's gonna give Israel new name you know that that's go to Isaiah 62 this morning I was studying on this and I thought you know I'm gonna just type a new name and see if it shows up anywhere else in the Bible and it sure did God's gonna give the 144,000 a new name Isaiah 62 1 through 5 oh I just love the Word of God Isaiah 62 1 through 5 for Zions sake will I not hold my peace and produce some sake I will not rest until the righteousness therefore go forth as a brightness and the salvation thereof as a lamp that Burness see God's not gonna rest God's not gonna rest until all of Israel's say aren't you glad about that God's not gonna rest until this message goes around the world amen first - and the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness and all kings thy glory and thou shalt be called by a new name which the mouth of the Lord shall name see the Gentiles are going to be able to witness this the Gentiles you see that Jesus loves Israel remember this is 698 years before Christ verse 3 thou should also be a crown of glory in the hand the Lord and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God I shall be no more term forsaken neither shall they land anymore be termed desolate but thou shalt be called Hezbollah and not land Beulah for the Lord delighteth in thee and thy land shall be married Beulah means married to see they're even going to be Israel's going to be married back to the Lord Jesus hallelujah amen verse five for as a young man marries a virgin so shall thy sons marry thee and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride so shall thy God rejoice over thee my if God's going to rejoice over Jews don't you think he's going to rejoice over the Gentiles as well don't you think Christ is going to rejoice over you church amen you're the bride you're the ones that's choosing to come out of layer to see you come out of her my people you've come out you've responded the bride has come forth and he's going to rejoice just like he rejoices in his hundred forty-four thousand he's gonna rejoice and all those that will seal by the Holy Ghost in the Laodicean Church age amen glory he has - amen because they're both the bride to him hallelujah so see she receives a new name the Gentiles are going to notice is the Gentiles shall see the righteousness of Israel how they loo you have the final admonition here I'm almost done here it's a familiar one he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches I want you to pay special attention this paragraph here every age ends with the same warning it is the constant plea that the churches listen to the voice of the Lord constant in this age the plea is even more insistent now that you will find that written the scripture but brother man picks it up by the Holy Spirit and said it's more insistent which is it actually means more earnest or emphatic in dwelling upon or persistent the voice of the Holy Spirit is more dwelling on this thought in this age which is the Philadelphia Church age for in this age the coming of Lord truly draweth nigh the question would perhaps arise is there another age beyond this one why the urgency the answer lies here here in the last age will be a short one a quick work of consummation praise God so I want you to notice this I'm gonna break down these words constant insist in urgency you probably are familiar with them but let me break them down so you can feel what the prophets saying here constantly constant means not changing a regular plea which is an earnest request so the Holy Spirit is constantly saying this the Holy Spirit will regularly plead to you the Holy Spirit will will regularly give an earnest request and say hear the voice of your my voice hear my voice hear my voice it'll be regular to see when people get tired of coming to church they get tired to read their Bible they get tired of saying amen to the word be careful you might be you might be hushing the holy voice of Christ because he has a constantly he's constantly pleading with everyone the church age now more insistent means this insistent means earnest or emphatic and dwelling upon so the Holy Spirit just dwells upon this idea of hearing my voice hear my voice it's unchanging listen to my voice obey my voice obey my word it doesn't let up and the church said it's constant but and so you have to make sure it's you don't you don't transgress the voice the police is regular its unchanging it's constant saying obey me listen here obey the coming of the Lord is that hand amen it doesn't change preacher try to keep preached on these things it's not me preaching it it's the Holy Ghost inside me amen and every preacher that's really a god called preacher is the same way it's not the if the preacher gets under the anointing and the anointing brings them to a constantly and insistent request and a urgency where the spirits trying to compel you to make immediate action amen others don't leave this service the same way you gave go go closer to Christ amen and people think is just a yell a yelling shouting arrogant mean preacher but it's not the preacher it's the real preacher of the holy preacher the Holy Ghost amen because we are at the end time or literally at the end of the end I've heard it before then make some immediate action and make it fresh to your heart for it used to be fresh to your heart it needs to be fresh to your heart again you need to sense the urgency you and I need a sense the urgency the constant unchanging requests of the Holy Spirit obey my voice obey my voice listen to my voice remember this is the age of the open door this is why God has so much urgency remember the false Jews and the synagogue of satan' came in after the initial outpouring the Holy Ghost brother BAM said then Satan set up his seat for church and state married but BAM said it repeated in Luther's age there was a revival Reformation and then they organized the Lutheran's organized Mary church and state and then the synagogue of Satan and false Jews popped up but man said anyone that says they've got the Holy Ghost and claims to be the original book of Acts church but doesn't have it he said they're liars and they're false Jews amen think about all the churches say God is speaking our church this morning we're going again I see I see it on the signs yesterday when I was driving around we're a spirit-led church are you how do you know because you obey what the Spirit says in the word you hear the constant urgency immediate action make a change make a change today praise God do something in your life to make a change so you can obey that word that you know God is asking you to obey and he keeps repeating it over and over and as age gets longer he told Ephesus he that hath the ear let him hear he told summer the same thing and now he's getting down a brother and said now here thinner Philadelphia now it's even more urgent hear the voice obey the voice because it's the age of the open door the true God is walking through that door a man is walking through that door to the rapture hallelujah and so we must heed the constant steady insistent urgent voice of God Almighty how many people do you know I take the Word of God that's seriously well Jesse I can feel the urgency when you preach even on a Wednesday night can you I hope you can if not brother sister you've drifted away you drifted away you let yourself drift off through the storms of life somehow you've let the storms of life or trials distract you or rock you to sleep or something we must hear the urgency of the Holy Spirit saying hear my voice today I'm trying to talk to you today it's more urgent than last year 2017 and over just two weeks into the year but it should be more urgent it gets more urgent as we approach the coming of the Lord remember of course we know this but we'll get to that in just a moment this is the age of the open door the open door bo-ram said carried over from Philadelphia to our age because our age is a short age we don't know if it's the shortest but we know it's gonna be a short age because the Bible said the Bible said God has to shorten the days that the elect that some election be saved he's shortening Laodicea yet the end at the same time all the time that he gives is his long-suffering he's so merciful he's so long-suffering go to Acts chapter 20 here I just want to bring this thought out here I've read it before on a couple occasions I want to read Acts chapter 20 again Paul is leaving Ephesus and these brothers know he's going to go be a martyr in Rome they know it AGGA buses prophesied different ones have prophesied in fact the Bible said every place Paul went there was prophecy that he had to go to Rome to die so they know he's going to leave and you know the story but let's look at verse 25 acts 20 25 and now behold I know that ye are among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God shall see my face no more I'll never see you again on this side in other words he was saying wherefore take you to record this day that I am pure from the blood of all men see preachers the blood is on our hands that's why I've got a preach heart that's right that's why every preacher has to preach heart because your blood is on my hands praise God verse 27 for I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock which over which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood for I notice that after my departing shall Grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock and also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them so see that not only were they gonna get attacked from wolves from the outside but Satan was gonna anoint somebody on the inside as well he's gonna send in outward battles and he's gonna anoint somebody on the inside to try to get them but the real trouble a believer stays faithful amen Paul knew it's gonna come Paul knew Satan's gonna send him invaders in imposters in wolves in but he also knew there's gonna be trouble we're from within the Saints that's right look at verse 31 and haughty well verse 30 how do you know they're gonna draw people after themselves instead of the word try to get their own disciples therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one of you day night and day with tears can everybody see how the Holy Spirit gave constant urgent warnings to Ephesus can anybody see that before the Prophet left for three years he was crying apparently night and day he was so burdened he knew wolves were coming in why didn't he stop after one year why didn't he just do one year of crying and warning couldn't stop because the Holy Spirit was inside of him brother Bram said the plea to he that hath an ear let him hear what the Holy Spirit saying that plea just gets more urgent it gets more important we must take heed to it the same thing happened in Paul's life amen Paul's had to keep warning them warning them remember brother Branham warned the tabernacle he said the tabernacle he said you'll lose your strength he told the random tabernacle that they'll lose their strength there was multiple warnings I've heard a brother preach on one time there's multiple warnings just over the course of the years just warning random Tabernacle and how many times of the Prophet warned you know people on the tapes but see a real man of God his warning increased his urgency increased now how many who got upset said the preacher preached on the same thing he warned us again for the second month in a row about wolves coming and brother Paul pastor Paul there's no wolves among us he wasn't talking about right then he saying get yourself out in the Word of God they're coming in when I leave it's been two and a half years and the Prophet has preached the same thing over and over again one time someone was so critical on brother brand they said and I listened all these sermons from 6465 and alls I hear is about Abraham and the last sign and and seven letters and Branham and they were so critical a brother branham and they said they got so tired of hearing about Genesis 18 where God in flesh came to Abraham and Sarah's tent why did they get critical church they got critical because the Holy Spirit was trying to show brother brandon as he traveled around he felt letting the Holy Spirit to warn them you're seeing your last sign get right with God recognize the discernment the same discernment that was on the son of man is on a son a man and that constant warning finally lo this person to sleep until they left the message after the threat of the other husband leaving them they leave they leave it and because they Krita sighs oh brother man just warning and look the Bible said a prophet warned them the same thing for three years there's going to be wolves coming in what's wrong with God anointing a prophet to say the a son of man is here a son of man is here for the body change saya has to receive strength and she's got to be corrected by the son of man hallelujah she had to be corrected by these son of man but the same today he's got to be corrected by a son a man hallelujah she's got to recognize the last side before the body change of people get tired of that the same people got tired of Paul service after service wolves are coming wolves are coming you better get stronger you better feed on the Word of God just like people today get tired the tribulation is coming the tribulations come we're in Laodicea we're later see and it actually loves them to sleep because they silence the voice of the Holy Ghost amen it's a constant urgent insist simply hear my voice obey my voice don't say the same because you won't say the same you cannot stay the same you're either growing closer or further away so the same people that criticize brother Branham the same ones that leave the same one that bleed brother BAM loved homosexuals because Leo and Jean became homosexuals that brother maybe brother brand they they said maybe brother Branham was homosexual shame on them the same voice that's warning them the last signs here thus say at the Lord the last signs here you'll see no greater side the Gentiles were see no greater sign they get tired of that they don't want to hear the warning of the Holy Spirit but the true believer will hear it and do something about it amen see st. Paul warned them day and night for three years with tears he was warning them because church the deeds of the Nicolaitans Paul knew it was coming in what were the deeds again the deeds of the Nicolaitans remember what they did they exalted the preachers above the laity and now Leia T ruled over everybody and then they had sorry then preachers ruled over everybody and then preachers made themselves rulers over preachers why I'm free in Christ here no one rules me but the Holy Ghost I'll take advice I'll take thoughts but I'm the one who's got to take it before the Lord in prayer let me say like this as I've said it before the deeds of the Nicolaitans makes everybody and the audience feel like only one person has to be anointed the preacher that is the deeds of Nicolaitans because they're conquering the laity that's why you got to come here and pray and you got to pray at your home remember that email gave you last week you got to pray at home and come early to pray here you've got to bring the oil you've got to have an anointing I've got to be just as anointed as you I praise God we've all got to be anointed Paul cried for three years saying only the preachers going to feel anointed only the preachers wolves are going to come in they're going to scatter the flock everybody needs the anointing of the Holy Ghost and fire because the Holy Ghost and fire will keep you alive amen Mary so he warned number three years they're going to come take all the Holy Ghost out of the people the people are going to be led of the Holy Spirit anymore the people just going to sit there and try to absorb preach to me preacher try to stir me up you've got to stir yourself up David encouraged himself in the Lord you got let the word comfort you've got to let the word stir you up on some of the amen on Friday had the day off from work cos of snow and he said how you doing I said I'm doing real good and we're talking about just struggles and things that you know things we battled I said brother I said I woke up this morning and I didn't feel one bit spiritual I woke up and I just felt like a dead carcass walking around I I didn't feel no anointing or nothing but you know what I got into the ring I stepped in the ring now you you didn't see me go like this you know like brother Kevin used to do you didn't see me do that but what I did I come down into my ring onto my knees in prayer and the first couple of prayers the words out didn't mean much to me I felt like you're just going through the motions and I said yes that's right devil I am going to go through the motions until Christ gives me more emotion glory I told my the Amen I said that's what the bat some days I woke up like this morning I wake up real spiritual mind and ready to go ready to study get up at 5:30 I'm ready to go I'm primed to go but Thursday I didn't wake up with any of that I had to step into the ring and sour meat myself up again so I start trying to knock myself out knock out the flesh and so pretty soon I started Anderson in interceding for people and as soon as I started praying for the people the tears came amen the sincerity came the victory came the ilis II was prayer of intercession I had to stop thinking about myself and start thinking about other people amen and that's what God used that day to stir me up and so I when I finally went to brother see a brother brother amen I read my Bible I'd prayed I've tried I've been on fire for Lord and we had a good old fellowship there by God's grace I really enjoyed that oh.sorry jumped ahead there sorry I didn't mean to do that I think I only tapped it when I was preaching so forgive me Lisa I didn't break it though praise the Lord you see we've got to have an anointing I'm gonna skip past this cuz I preach on real hearing recently hearing is doing if you came a church and you don't change anything you didn't hear one thing the preacher said but if you go home and change something you heard what he said hey what the Holy Spirit said are you with me you got to change something your life in other words all I got to be more dedicated tomorrow morning or I've got to make sure I pray more tonight so tomorrow morning when I wake up I'll be more focused on God you've got to change something got to draw closer to Christ now this idea about warning the warning it's more urgent more intense as the preaching goes on as time goes on jesus said the Holy Spirit will say hear me hear what other spirits say here and it's supposed to get more urgent it got more urgent in the days of Israel I'm know that and even Jesus and I didn't had time to study this I'd have time to say this remember Jesus even foretold his death many times he's just kept urgently saying I'm gonna have to go to Jerusalem they're gonna have to kill me I'm gonna be delivering the hands of Gentile sinful men and the Bible said they didn't remember until after the resurrection he kept warning he kept warning they're gonna try to scatter you like sheep they're gonna smite the Shepherd that the Sheep might be scattered he kept warning them and it just went over their heads over their heads Church I don't want to go over my head I don't want the voice of the Holy Spirit to go over my head I want to go into my heart amen glory I want to go in my ears and in my heart so I'm making ready for the coming of the Lord it's not getting less the urgency is getting more urgent because there's fewer and fewer people actually going to be saved there's fewer people that are going to walk through that open door we're living in the last minutes of history the last the doors almost closed they men for the Gentiles so can you see the pattern I just had a few minutes look at this yesterday look at this this is a nice visual here's the Kings here's the kings of Israel now notice Moses warned them in 1500 BC if you don't keep the commands your you won't be so you won't stay in the land very long they were warned before they got in let me know God's interested in giving warnings warning warning warning warning warning God gave warnings before they even got there and then once they get in there what happens you know they get divided Solomon goes to idolatry and his two sons ray of balm and Jeroboam the kingdom is divided so see before they're carried away real foreign sin there comes a division that's why Saint loves to divide churches well if he can divide that group he can lead them away into the wilderness of sin he has to divide them first that's what the deeds of Nicolaitans that had divided the preachers from the laity only the preachers are anointed I hope you're anointed this morning I I hope somebody's at north of this morning Amen I don't want to be just me I feel the urgency the Holy Spirit but everybody needs to feel that everybody has to feel that and then Samaria fell and 740 BC the Assyrian captivity the fool that just the city fell there the whole Assyrian captivity took over all of the Northern Kingdom of Israel in 722 now look Church God gave them warning after warning Joel Amos Hosea Micah Isaiah God gave them warning after warning don't you love it God comes in here gives us been the rod to warn us he gives us brother Jesse to warn us brother Simon brother Brooks brother Craig hallelujah brother Matt lightener God brings all these warnings hear the voice hear the voice listen to my voice God is rich in mercy to give so many warnings he does it because He loves us that's why I don't get tired of coming to church I always want that voice I always want to be sensitive to that voice of the Holy Spirit what Lord what would you like me to do sir what can I do to serve you better hold on I want to hear that voice look at Hosea this is beautiful wear this in our Bible time a few nights ago I don't even know I was gonna be so inspired to me Hosea 14 oh israel look he's saying return unto the Lord thy God come back you've fallen away come back look at the constant urge the Holy Spirit come back return for you phone away by your iniquity take with you words and turn to Lorna look he says you have to say the right thing to the Lord you can't just say well I'm sorry okay I'll get back ride with God you've got to say the right thing just like Hattie right had to say the right thing for the third pole so you got we've got to say the right thing to get right with God the Bible tells us what to say take these words into her Lord and say unto him say this to God say God take away all my iniquity and receive me graciously amen have mercy on me let me receive your grace take away my sins so will render the calves of our lips when you can say I'm sorry I'm wrong it was my fault it was all on the guilty one when you can say that it's like offering a sacrifice on the altar of God amen that's the calves of your lips that's the offering that's the sacrifice that God wants to see amen hallelujah when you can admit I was wrong it was my fault I should not have done that I sinned I transgress the Lord well you can say that say God have mercy on me now you're close to the kingdom of God amen members not the guy that says oh I fast three times a week look at me it's the guy who says God be merciful to me a sinner I know part sanada-san are no my souls out of center but your flesh and minds sure are sinners sons mine my flesh don't want to do it I got to beat it up and bring it into subjection I got a boxing match every day to bring them under subjection look as sure which is Assyria a seer will not save us the American government is not going to save you the United Nations is not going to save you your employer is not going to save you your family's not going to save you will not ride upon horses neither will we say anymore to the work of our hands here are gods for in thee the fatherless find mercy even those who have no father God you're the father to them and how much more is got a father to us amen I will heal their backsliding I will love them freely if you can do it bring the right sacrifice bring the calves of your lips say I was wrong it was my fault I'm the one that sinned it wasn't God God doesn't lead a man in temptation and even this it wasn't my wife's fault it wasn't my children's fault it was my fault wasn't my dad's fault wasn't my mom's thought it was my fault you've got to own it it's got to be your sacrifice for my angers turn away from him November let's go back there he was saying this let us at the end of his ministry released recordings he's saying this right before they fall return him to me return if there's anyone left return look at the faithful voice of the Holy Spirit right before Assyria comes in there and wipes him out he's saying sirrah won't save you they're not gonna be friends with you they're gonna destroy your life return to God and bring him the right sacrifice faithful God's constant faithful voice urging people do something about it take action change your life how many want lives that please the Lord we gotta take action if there's any place in our life where we're not taking action he's demanding action there's no sincerity there's no action all right brother Graham I'm always used this marriage so what if I said to my wife you know when we work or whatever I said I want to marry you but there's no action of buying an engagement ring there's no action of going to talk to her daddy there's no action of preparing a future home we got to have action behind our words if not the words just fall to the ground soon as we say follow the ground vain words there's no power in those words God was so faithful Joel Amos Hosea Isaiah Micah now here's Judah Judah kept going because you know Josiah was king of Judah Zedekiah was the last one the destruction of Jerusalem was in 607 BC that's what it was destroyed Judah was exiled Thole exile later and they received warnings from Zephaniah nahum habakkuk Obadiah and Jeremiah warning after warning after warning message after message after message it's more urgent now's the time to make a choice now's the time to follow the Lord now this story don't try to read this story it's written these words are really small but I liked it I saw it on a blog post this morning caution the moving walkways ending caution the moving walkway is ending if you've ever used an automated walkway to Airport you've heard this kind of announcement repeated has anybody ever tripped over one of those before I stumbled a little bit one time I wasn't looking up I wasn't quite ready you know in the airports the big airports like Chicago and different places when you go I forget what they're called now but you change what they called terminals yeah terminals sometimes they have those big long walkways and I just thought was so funny warning it's gonna end the walkway is gonna end the reason they do that is so is for your safety and protection and their liability they're not liable and God's not liable if he sends us warning after warning the blood will not be on the preachers hand the blood will not be upon God's hand it'll be on your hand be on my him we've got to take heed to what the Word of God is saying that's from the adults all the way down to the children the children have to listen to the voice of God and obey the voice of God and what this this uh this blog writer mentioned Galatians where Paul says if any man change the gospel they're a curse remember he said so I say it once so I'll say it again if any man change the gospel they're a curse remember that it's a warning again another warning another warning another warning I'm almost done and not only is this so but one must always remember that in the eyes of God time is very fleeting yeah a thousand years or but just a day and if he is coming within a few hours as he views time do you know that he's gonna be here in a few more hours Church we just gotta wait a little bit longer amen just a few more weary hours and then then he surely must warn us all I'm sure warned us with all agency there's gonna be so much agency preaching to the bride and foolish version and his voice must continually sound in our hearts to be ready against that coming you must continually hear that voice hear what he's saying hear what the preacher sang do what the preacher sang because it's the Word of God do it it's gonna be more constant it's gonna be more faithful it's gonna be more insistent if we do what he says the trouble is today there's so many voices in the world aren't there how many can say Amen there's so many voices out there and we don't some if we're not careful we don't even hear what the Spirit says the church there's so many voices in the world so many problems and needs crying for attention but there will never be a voice so important so worth attending as the voice of the Spirit he that hath him ear and ear let him hear what the spirit saith of the churches I use this in the future home number this so this was an Adam and Eve around the earth okay this is the flood of Noah's day this with Jesus Christ crucified here's the Millennium so we are right here Church if we could draw a line here we are right here and on the edge brother Brandon was a hair over right next to us this is God's view remember brother have said God let you have to look at it through God's view of time it's only been one two three four five six we're just finishing the sixth day we're just finishing it in God's time so I'm been going on for about a week right little over halfway through the week he cleanse it with the blood of Jesus at the beginning of the week he gave it a water baptism I need to see a baptism at the beginning I'm gonna sanctify it with the blood of my son and I'm gonna burn it with fire at the end of the week and we are right here so what we expect the voice of the Holy Spirit say just relax you're okay don't get me wrong don't get wrong the Holy Spirit says Shalom right we all heard that peace God wants you to have peace in your soul but the only way you have peace with God is to do what God says and that's listen to the voice of the Holy Spirit so this is God's viewpoint God looks he looks back at our our lives are just a real small hair right here real small hair and maybe this blue is you know coming over a little bit past the line there maybe but you understand we're right there God's view of time we're just finishing the sixth day let's stay on our feet here let's review this entire Philadelphia Church age in just about one or two minutes I hope this series has been a tremendous blessing to you my plan right now is to go into Laodicea and just review it a little bit because already preached five sermons on it I may go back but let's review this before we close the angel was John Wesley Jesus and his deity brother Branham said he was holy and true which means Jesus is the perfect realization of life bread water love everything he's the perfect realization of all these natural things comfort peace he is true he's the true bread he's the true light he's true forgiveness he's true peace he's true life he's everything the key of David is the key on the shoulder because Isaiah 22 verse 2 said the key was on his shoulder and the shoulder meant Jesus's responsibility first bride but RAM said also meant the key being a part of the millennium I didn't mean party it might be a rejoicing time it might be a holy party but surely ain't gonna be a worldly one the key being a part of the millennium since Jesus is the son of David yes have the key of David because the son of David takes us into the millennium to reign as son of David the no man openeth or shutteth brother Brahim clearly said every denomination claims that it opens the door that's not true Jesus and Jesus alone he sets the members in the body he endowed them with their ministries I so love that Jesus gave me this ministry I didn't go looking for it he gave it to me he puts the gifts at her disposal he cares for her and guides her she is his sole property and no one has and and he has no other one but her thy works the greatest works of this age have the greatest works of Christian literature and teaching and preaching came from this era never has it's preachers and teachers been match and never will be our preaching will never match what they had although we have greater revelation their quality of preaching we'd say or maybe the quantity of preaching quantity opened or Jesus is the open doors Jesus is the revelation of the word then it's the missionary age of brotherly love through Jesus no man can cut him out were kept by the word and they've not denied my name but mam said the revelation of the word on the Godhead and the name of the Lord Jesus Christ was received and cannot be stopped because no man can shut that door little strength he said the word was well preached but the power of the Spirit was missing the synagogue of Satan the false lines used those without the baptism Holy Ghost with the denominational spirit who claimed to be the original church come and worship before thy feet the false Jews or Christians will be judged at the white throne as the bride sits with him the word of my patience we looked at on Wednesday the hour temptation will be kept from the laying down of the mark of the beast because we have patiently kept Jesus's commands I come quickly meant that Philadelphia is just one age away from the rapture tribulation of the world systems hold fast means persevere don't quit and no man take that crown crowns were given out to kings and priests who ruled reign and suffered for him they fought with the full armor of God and used every weapon at their disposal hey man can you say Amen Church the pillar in the temple brother Graham said it's the bride becomes a part of the body because she's kept the same gospel that Paul preached and and because of that never leaves the side of Christ she becomes a part of that body she becomes a part of the body of Christ new name written thereon the name of the husband gives the wife when he takes her to himself hear the spirit the spirit has a
