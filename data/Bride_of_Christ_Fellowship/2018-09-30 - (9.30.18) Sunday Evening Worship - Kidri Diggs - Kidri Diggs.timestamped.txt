[26:45] that so we're thankful for God's gift
[26:51] that's another segment it's not the

[26:57] of knowing Christ and Christ just uses
[26:59] us in His mercy none of us have special
[27:03] greater than any why only one great one

[32:51] Department says thou shall review all
[32:55] the way with the LORD thy God greatly
[32:58] he's four years in the wilderness nobody
[33:02] had to prove to know what was in my
[33:06] heart without risking his commandments
[33:10] Brno in heat Hungary and suffered two
[33:14] hundred and family with men on which
[33:17] thou knowest not
[33:19] my father's men that he might make you
[33:23] know that man left if I break alone but
[33:27] by every word that proceedeth
[33:38] [Music]
[34:54] it was faith but kind of Express tonight
[35:39] and let's unfold take a little bit boy
[35:42] you know we kind of talked about the
[35:44] foundation but let's understand the
[35:52] working of faith or no and who we talk
[35:56] about me you know I think a lot of times
[35:58] we can
[36:00] possessions jewel-like god bless me with
[36:03] a house god best with a car all these
[36:06] end up with believing for but the
[36:09] attribute of faith is more than just
[36:11] your natural possessions because the
[36:14] bible says you know without faith it is
[36:17] impossible to please so we can't just
[36:34] you know you know when we look at the
[36:38] christian was the whole christian
[36:40] journey is about believing in a god that
[36:43] you can't see what's on that side only
[36:50] have reaching into the unseen something
[37:00] that was standing on the say okay this
[37:02] is what I'm planting my faithful doing
[37:05] we look at that scripture you know just
[37:09] through my favorite if I can start I
[37:11] kind of wanna reflect either churches
[37:14] where but you know kind of came and said
[37:21] look we don't live by our works all
[37:24] these church he got something rose up in
[37:37] him he said no I'm not
[37:39] listen by the way you're doing come I
[37:41] say so what was he saying he was saying
[37:45] I'm living with your work means it means
[37:56] Romans suggestion about faith that were
[38:00] faint me moral commissioning me so when
[38:03] that faith is impossible to please God
[38:06] what is God saying without conviction
[39:23] [Music]
[39:44] this that word means it means moral
[39:53] conviction religious truth or the
[39:57] truthfulness of God when we say we're
[40:00] living my faith we're living by Morgan
[40:02] bishop or the truthfulness of God
[40:05] earlier so when you say I have
[40:07] convictions you live in my the
[40:10] truthfulness of God we are we happy
[40:31] [Music]
[41:41] [Music]
[41:48] and God knows who
[41:53] what is he oh yes sir look you told just
[41:59] in the book of Deuteronomy
