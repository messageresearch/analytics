[34:04] at that here actually is got a
[34:06] revelation on 312 pardon me 312 amen I
[34:14] do apologize you know this morning I
[34:17] came out everybody about Darrell Ward
[34:18] not being here so I'm sorry I actually
[34:19] knew that on Thursday I just forgot to
[34:21] let everybody know so forgive me I
[34:22] wanted to let everybody know sooner
[34:24] I just forgot Thursday was a crazy busy
[34:27] day and I just forgot to let everybody
[34:29] know so pardon me we rescheduled for
[34:32] March 11th so we're looking forward to
[34:34] our brother coming March 11th and he
[34:37] said well Jesse said I've been on the
[34:38] the field for 27 years he said we can
[34:41] switch it out with another weekend with
[34:43] another minister so he switched it out
[34:44] and now he's out in Arizona you know so
[34:47] they just got all the good weather
[34:49] you know but anyways we're grateful and
[34:52] I just don't want to put the brother in
[34:54] harm's way you know on Wednesday night I
[34:55] prayed for wisdom and I just said I'm
[34:56] just gonna put in your hands and I just
[34:58] waited I was waiting for the latest
[34:59] forecast and then at then brother
[35:02] Darrell just you know said well I'll
[35:03] just reschedule you know so I let I just
[35:05] let God make the decision but ultimately
[35:06] he made the decision so I felt like that
[35:09] was just wait I was just waiting on the
[35:10] Lord and try to let God have his way
[35:13] so revelation 3:12 although just gave it
[35:16] only wrong I'm very disappointed I wish
[35:18] he could be here because I know he's got
[35:20] a wonderful ministry revelation 3:12 at
[35:25] the same time I'm happy to be with all
[35:26] of you by God's grace so thankful this
[35:29] evening uh while your turn there
[35:31] yesterday I just read this whole book
[35:33] yesterday it's on Christian modesty it's
[35:34] only like fifty some pages I'm sorry
[35:38] seventy four pages I just read that and
[35:39] then I bought this one the roaring 20s
[35:42] so I'm gonna preach on modesty and I've
[35:44] kind of been working on my book I
[35:45] finished chapter three this week and so
[35:48] my mind just kind of been in there so
[35:49] I'll probably just show you maybe some
[35:51] things you never knew before and go over
[35:53] some scriptures there's been a few
[35:54] scriptures have been very helpful with
[35:55] Christian modesty and there's some
[35:57] pictures I might take pictures of and
[35:58] show them to you like women in Chicago
[36:01] getting arrested for wearing shorts in
[36:02] 1922 they got arrested and the cops are
[36:06] like and they're fighting and their poll
[36:08] of them trying to get into the the wagon
[36:09] or whatever they call though they call
[36:11] it the paddy wagon haven't they caught
[36:12] it back there just for wearing shorts
[36:15] and looking just a matter of you know a
[36:17] hundred years look look how look how
[36:19] this society has been become degraded it
[36:24] used to be imprison a ball and now it's
[36:27] acceptable so I just want to review some
[36:30] of those things because that's what my
[36:32] Bert My Mind's on I got a burden for
[36:33] that right now I want to get that out to
[36:36] anyone who needs it and I know you know
[36:39] I know in these labors you know these
[36:42] YouTube Labor's and things were trying
[36:43] to get out the message I know it's of
[36:45] God because we've had so many
[36:46] testimonies and I've recently had
[36:50] somebody tell me brother Jesse they said
[36:51] every single video did speaks to my
[36:54] heart I felt that's that's perfect
[36:56] because I have two witnesses every sin
[36:58] every video we made speaks to my heart
[36:59] and so it speaks to other believers
[37:02] heart the
[37:02] the word will always speak to your heart
[37:04] at a man a 70 72 year old preacher
[37:07] called me this week and he said brother
[37:10] Jeff's Pastor Jesse he's I just want to
[37:12] tell you about your serpents evideo and
[37:13] I thought oh boy here it comes
[37:15] I'm gonna get it he said that was
[37:16] amazing so I said brother thank you for
[37:20] that encouragement I don't get many
[37:21] calls like that like last week I had six
[37:23] minutes long of voicemails bawl me out
[37:25] for the Godhead you know but I said I'm
[37:28] got back to that guy got back to him a
[37:29] couple times but anyway I just want to
[37:31] give you a little update there
[37:32] revelation 3:12 will try to finish this
[37:36] this morning him that overcometh will i
[37:41] make a pillar and the temple of my god
[37:42] and he shall go out I'm sorry go no more
[37:47] out now write upon him the name of my
[37:49] god and the name of the city of my god
[37:51] which is New Jerusalem which cometh down
[37:54] out of heaven from my god and I will
[37:56] write upon him my new name he that hath
[38:01] an ear let him hear what the spirit
[38:02] saith unto the churches
[38:04] Amen if you need on your heart just make
[38:06] it known unto God why don't we have one
[38:07] more word of Prayer have any father you
[38:10] see the needs on the hearts of the

[39:11] their praise god
[39:13] sounds like we're getting some plowing
[39:15] out there praise God
[39:16] amen so you can switch over Malachi when
[39:19] you're ready or just do a little bit
[39:21] teaching here I think we'll finish the
[39:24] Philadelphia Church age this morning all
[39:32] right so we're looking at the
[39:33] Philadelphia Church age and I got my
[39:35] count mixed up last time and this is
[39:37] part 52 today I got my count mixed up I
[39:39] was one off I was I said on Wednesday
[39:42] was 52 but this is actually 52 I went
[39:45] back to check so our series progression
[39:47] we've spent a lot more time on
[39:48] Philadelphia than any other Church age
[39:51] so I had five on emphasis eight on
[39:54] Simona five on pergamo seven on thirty
[39:57] or nine on Sardis and 13 on Philadelphia
[39:59] and Laodicea we did five back in 2015
[40:04] praise God I think you'll be blessed
[40:06] this morning I think it'd be a real
[40:07] strength to your heart I won't look at
[40:09] the name of my god in the name of the
[40:11] city of my god as the prophet teaches us
[40:14] here in the scripture or here I'm sorry
[40:16] in the church age book par me he quotes
[40:19] the scripture and then I want you to
[40:21] note here that these are the rewards for
[40:23] the overcomer and it's a reward for God
[40:27] to write his name upon the overcomer
[40:30] now how many know that the Holy Spirit
[40:32] is writing his word upon our hearts
[40:34] right now how many know that currently
[40:37] right now the passo Paul says in 2nd
[40:39] Corinthians 3 that the Holy Spirit is
[40:42] writing the word upon our hearts but the
[40:46] Bible says one day he's gonna write our
[40:49] new name upon us now I don't know I
[40:53] haven't I don't haven't got the
[40:54] revelation of this one but I just want
[40:56] let you know there's two were different
[40:58] writings there's the writing of the word
[41:00] on your soul and there's gonna be a
[41:02] future writing upon the bride so I
[41:06] imagine it might be writing on the book
[41:09] of or the Lamb's Book of Life or or some
[41:11] type of some type of writing we're not
[41:13] quite sure but we know there will be a
[41:16] writing it'll be the name the Bible said
[41:18] of God the name of the city of my god
[41:21] which is New Jerusalem and the new name
[41:25] the new name of Jesus praise God now
[41:28] remember Church its
[41:29] reward so if you can overcome you get
[41:33] the reward of his name Amen
[41:36] and remember you're rewarded because
[41:38] you're worthy not of your flesh we know
[41:41] the flesh will never be worthy enough
[41:45] how many know that when Paul was talking
[41:48] about self-denial how many know that
[41:50] Paul was talking about a boxer remember
[41:53] that first good news 9 he said I have to
[41:55] beat my body and bring it under
[41:57] subjection so the illustration is that
[41:59] Apostle Paul stepped inside the ring can
[42:01] you get the picture of a boxer in your
[42:03] mind I know Kevin used to box you
[42:04] remember going through the ropes brother
[42:06] Kevin into the ring and brought them st.
[42:09] Paul's like every day I've got to crawl
[42:11] through the ropes and get ready to fight
[42:13] my opponent get all warmed up you know
[42:16] hit the bag a little bit before you jump
[42:18] in there you know maybe do the bag my
[42:20] mind goes the rocky because I watched
[42:21] those you know worldly videos but Paul
[42:26] said every day I step into the ring
[42:28] against Paul can you believe that that's
[42:32] that's the illustration he gives and we
[42:36] and we know you're fighting against
[42:38] yourself you are your own worst enemy we
[42:42] know we know that from the prophets
[42:44] message so you've got to defeat yourself
[42:48] and if you can defeat yourself you get a
[42:51] reward remember what was Satan's plan
[42:54] always Satan's plan was to make Adam and
[42:56] Eve think they were gods right it was to
[43:01] make them think that they were gods and
[43:05] that their thoughts could be exalted
[43:06] above the Word of God that was his
[43:09] thought surely God won't let you die say
[43:13] surely there's a different
[43:14] interpretation to the message of the
[43:17] hour
[43:17] surely everybody's going to be alright
[43:19] and surely everybody's going to be save
[43:22] and surely they're not surely if you eat
[43:25] of that fruit you shall die so Satan
[43:28] tries to exalt them to think oh if you
[43:31] can just compromise a little bit on the
[43:32] word you'll be you'll be as God you'll
[43:36] be you'll be more spiritual but no we're
[43:40] actually more spiritual when we just
[43:41] obey the plain humble Word of God
[43:43] amen we are more spiritual if we can
[43:47] just listen to Jesus amen
[43:49] just do what Jesus said and we get
[43:52] rewarded hallelujah you're rewarded
[43:57] because you're worthy and brother BAM
[43:59] said it's because you walk with Him on
[44:01] earth and if you walk with Him on earth
[44:03] he'll walk with you in the new earth
[44:05] amen the new earth and I'm pulling this
[44:09] from of course from the Sardis and
[44:10] church age the only way we could get a
[44:12] reward and a new name is if we're worthy
[44:16] of that name and to be worthy you just
[44:19] have to walk in the footprints of Christ
[44:22] remember this he said they shall walk
[44:24] with me this is what God says he'll
[44:26] bestow upon them that for this upright
[44:28] walk this is part of their inheritance
[44:30] that he's reserved for them if they were
[44:32] willing to walk with him through the
[44:34] toils and snares of life and be an honor
[44:38] to him he was going to reward them
[44:41] how many been through toils in their
[44:44] life only been through his traps where
[44:46] Satan tried to trap you into some sin he
[44:49] tried to say like this he tried to chop
[44:50] you into a negative attitude he tried to
[44:53] trap you into disobedience to the word
[44:55] he tried to trap you into lust of the
[44:57] flesh or pride of life or lust of the
[45:00] eyes he tried to trap you but thank God
[45:02] for that song amazing grace through many
[45:04] dangers toils and snares I have already
[45:06] come I didn't stay in the snare I came
[45:09] out of the snare amen if you're willing
[45:13] to walk with them through the toils and
[45:15] snares of life then he'll walk with you
[45:18] the Bible said he's not forgetful of our
[45:21] labor of love God will always recompense
[45:23] us for our efforts to please him he'll
[45:25] always pay us back how many are witness
[45:27] of that whenever you give to others
[45:29] it'll be given back to you how many can
[45:31] say Amen
[45:32] whatever you've given because God loves
[45:35] a cheerful Giver
[45:36] we must give our time let's give our
[45:38] attention give our finances give our
[45:41] food give our clothes we must give
[45:43] whatever we have away give and it shall
[45:45] be given unto you the unchangeable law
[45:48] of God Amen that's what God's that's
[45:51] what God tells us he's not forgetful to
[45:54] forget our labor of love yes they've
[45:57] walk through the world and had not
[45:59] partake and I remember that story the
[46:01] sheep we told her brother branham he was
[46:02] in a European country he saw the
[46:05] Shepherd gonna lead us his sheep through
[46:07] the market and he said oh boy here comes
[46:09] a big stampede all those sheep are gonna
[46:11] jump on the tables because the food's
[46:12] out on the tables and brother have said
[46:14] to my amazement the Sheep just follow
[46:16] the shepherd they walked through the
[46:19] market and they didn't partake of all
[46:20] the food that was laying right before
[46:22] their hungry mouths and that's because
[46:25] they were obedient to the shepherd and
[46:27] we must be obedient to the great
[46:28] Shepherd the Shepherd of your soul the
[46:31] Lord Jesus Christ we must not partake of
[46:34] it we're going to walk right by it we're
[46:36] gonna walk right by you know and any sin
[46:39] you can name out there on the table that
[46:41] say of Satan's table you're gonna walk
[46:43] by every temptations or your life the
[46:44] older you get the more temptations there
[46:47] are right the greater temptations there
[46:49] are and so we've got to be able to look
[46:52] past that and not get not get our
[46:55] spiritual noses sniffing into the things
[46:57] of the world we must not flirt Amen
[46:59] Church not even flirt don't even stop
[47:02] for a second remember don't stop for one
[47:04] second don't even start entertaining
[47:06] that thought in your mind because
[47:07] remember the first fruit that Eve
[47:09] partook of was the fruit of lies and
[47:12] then she partook of the fruit of
[47:15] adultery after that that's right that's
[47:18] the Word of God she first received that
[47:20] that seed of a lie and that's the first
[47:23] fruit she actually partook of and then
[47:25] the fruit of adultery came later and
[47:27] then she received the the wrong seed we
[47:29] know that so we must make sure we
[47:31] remember that God's Word is above all of
[47:34] our thoughts amen do not partake of
[47:37] anything amen of the world they'd not
[47:40] let the world systems overcome them when
[47:42] the illustrious names of that age had
[47:44] yielded to the banishment of the state
[47:46] and chosen political mindedness rather
[47:48] than spiritual - and were on their way
[47:50] back into the world these few stood for
[47:53] the word of God and thereby honor the
[47:55] Lord hallelujah now he would honor them
[47:59] in return yeah praise God we've got to
[48:03] honor him here and it'll honor us there
[48:06] amen
[48:08] for they shall walk with him in white
[48:10] they'd identify them
[48:11] with him on earth and now he would
[48:12] identify himself with them in the New
[48:14] Jerusalem and how marvelous will be that
[48:16] identification and so I pulled this out
[48:19] of Samuel which you're familiar with I'm
[48:21] sorry I got a typo I just saw that
[48:23] samuli Samuel II it's actually Samuel
[48:25] now the Bible said God was rebuking
[48:29] elide he said why do you kick at my
[48:31] sacrifice in my offering which I've
[48:33] commanded my habitation and you honor
[48:35] your son's above me to make yourselves
[48:38] fat with the cheapest of all the
[48:40] offerings of Israel my people so Eli was
[48:44] letting his sons sin in the service of
[48:47] the Lord they were eating fat from the
[48:50] from the the burnt offerings
[48:52] I'm so not the burnt offering from the
[48:53] sin offering the burnt offering was
[48:55] completely burned to God but they would
[48:57] take in the fat belong to God but they
[48:59] would take that fat and they would they
[49:00] would have the first choice once the
[49:02] sacrifice was rightly divided they would
[49:05] take things that belong to God and Eli
[49:09] let it go on and then he would sleep
[49:11] they would sleep with women and commit
[49:13] adultery on their wives and there was no
[49:15] correction the house of God God's house
[49:17] must be a house of correction even the
[49:20] littlest things a full wrong Lord show
[49:22] us were wrong that we can get right and
[49:24] honor you because if we don't care take
[49:27] care of that little 11 it 11 your whole
[49:29] life
[49:30] that's exactly right wherefore the Lord
[49:33] God of Israel saith I said indeed that
[49:35] thy house and the house of thy father
[49:37] should walk before me forever but now
[49:39] the Lord sayeth be it far from me for
[49:44] them that honor me I will honor and they
[49:48] that despise me shall be lightly
[49:50] esteemed amen it's the law of God if you
[49:53] honor God God will honor you praise the
[49:56] Lord if people speak evil of you just
[49:59] honor God because pretty soon they're
[50:00] gonna say something nice about you I've
[50:03] seen with my own family when I first
[50:04] came in the message they said you're of
[50:05] the devil you know this is leaning of
[50:07] the devil and then I told that story
[50:08] where my mom sent me a letter you know
[50:10] she was saying first of all she thought
[50:11] we're of the devil and then I sent her
[50:13] something in the mail as a love offering
[50:15] and she wrote me back and said she said
[50:17] your church
[50:18] she said truly is the true Church of God
[50:21] before she was saying it was the Church
[50:23] of the devil and now
[50:24] because of love and because of constant
[50:27] application of love now she can
[50:29] recognize it's the true Church of God
[50:30] amen
[50:32] that's a witness to me if you honor God
[50:34] God will honor you hallelujah it's
[50:37] exactly right the Prophet said it makes
[50:40] me rejoice he says and yet makes me weep
[50:44] to think of the consolation or
[50:46] condescension for you will note that he
[50:48] is not dressed in another different
[50:50] color from the Saints as earthly nude
[50:52] leaders would so do know they are like
[50:55] him he's like them they are like him
[50:57] even as John said for they see him as he
[51:00] is amen the RAM said for they are worthy
[51:05] do you realize who is saying this it is
[51:07] Jesus the worthy one himself this is the
[51:10] only one who is a kind of worthy to take
[51:12] the book out of the hand of him who sits
[51:14] upon the throne and now this worthy one
[51:18] is saying to his Saints you are worthy
[51:21] here is this one the only one qualified
[51:23] to judge and indeed all judgment is
[51:26] committed unto him and he says you are
[51:28] worthy we must walk with Him how many
[51:32] want to walk with him to walk with that
[51:35] means you must honor him and honor his
[51:37] word for they are worthy and then the
[51:41] Prophet gives the way translation in
[51:43] other words Romans 8:33 says God says
[51:46] I'm righteous the King James says who
[51:49] shall a which means accuse who shall
[51:52] accuse anything to the charge of God's
[51:54] elect it is God that justifies there is
[52:00] why there in the white light of God's
[52:02] righteousness hear the sweet voice of
[52:04] Jesus as he says these are mine they're
[52:07] righteous they're worthy they shall walk
[52:10] with me in life
[52:12] how many grateful that they have someone
[52:14] to walk through through the toils and
[52:16] snares of life I'm grateful I have just
[52:18] more than my wife I appreciate my wife I
[52:20] appreciate all you all being here
[52:22] throughout my toils and snares but
[52:24] really the one we've got to walk with is
[52:26] Jesus Christ and if we walk with Him
[52:30] that means when we go home and our
[52:31] prayer closets or when the the trials of
[52:33] life drive us to our knees that we
[52:36] ultimately look to Christ for strength
[52:38] we look to the word for guidance we look
[52:41] to the word for wisdom are we going to
[52:43] choose the word or choose a compromise
[52:45] on the word we must choose the Word of
[52:47] God then we're walking worthy then we're
[52:49] honoring the Lord amen hallelujah and
[52:55] I'll write upon him the name of my God
[52:57] in the name of the city of my god well
[53:00] Graham said to what is the name of God
[53:02] well he was God with us or Immanuel but
[53:05] that was not his given name thou shalt
[53:07] call his name Jesus jesus said I came to
[53:10] my father's name and you receive me not
[53:11] therefore the name of God is Jesus for
[53:14] that is the name he came in he is Lord
[53:16] Jesus Christ and what name does a woman
[53:19] take when she marries the man she takes
[53:21] his name it will be his name that is
[53:23] given unto the bride when he takes her
[53:25] to himself and the prophet quotes
[53:30] revelation 21:1 through for this the
[53:34] prophet said this is when he takes her
[53:36] to herself at the future home where they
[53:38] have their own home and I saw a new
[53:42] heaven and new earth for the first
[53:43] heaven the first Earth were passed away
[53:45] and there was no more sea
[53:46] and I John saw the holy city New
[53:49] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[53:51] heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[53:55] her husband so this city is like the
[53:58] bride because this city has been brought
[54:02] from Evan to earth just as Rebecca was
[54:06] brought to Isaac Amen
[54:08] Hanukkah the cities like the bride being
[54:12] brought escorted to the husband Amen
[54:15] it's a city that's adorned prepared as a
[54:17] bride for her husband and I heard a
[54:21] great voice out of heaven saying behold
[54:23] the tabernacle of God is with men and he
[54:27] will dwell with them and they shall be
[54:29] his people and God himself shall be with
[54:31] them and be their God and God shall wipe
[54:34] away all tears from their eyes so the
[54:37] look church even at the future home will
[54:40] still be crying will still be crying
[54:43] we'll be able to cry at the wedding
[54:45] supper remember will wipe tears away
[54:46] from our eyes there the scripture says
[54:49] maybe the Armageddon I'll know if we'll
[54:51] cry there not
[54:52] we'll cry here when the future home
[54:54] comes down and we're standing there with
[54:56] Jesus I imagine Jesus will turn a look
[54:58] at our look at his wife and say I
[55:00] prepared you our mansion I went away and
[55:04] I remember like he said in John 14 he
[55:06] said he said I would have told you so
[55:09] right I would have if I was going to go
[55:12] prepare a place I would have told you so
[55:13] and I went to repair your home here
[55:15] here's your home now here's the keys to
[55:18] your home I didn't hear you praise God
[55:21] here's your future home amen
[55:23] and God shall wipe away all tears from
[55:27] their eyes can you imagine walking not
[55:32] you see it you see a perversion of it
[55:33] today where you know celebrities will
[55:35] buy people a new home right or they'll
[55:37] give them a new car and they'll start
[55:38] crying
[55:38] oh yeah they cried and and and they're
[55:42] so happy but you know what that home
[55:44] after 10 years it gets pretty dirty
[55:46] doesn't it that car you know we got our
[55:48] car two years ago it's pretty dirty now
[55:50] I try to keep it clean but you know the
[55:52] newness of it wears off and those people
[55:55] you know if they live long enough cars
[55:57] gonna get old it's gonna break down
[55:58] Oprah bought everybody car remember that
[56:00] one show I never watch it by selling the
[56:02] news she put a car a car key under every
[56:04] seat and all the girls scream god I got
[56:08] a new car and they're so excited about a
[56:10] car that's going to break down some of
[56:14] them are going to get in car accidents
[56:15] and total their car and they're excited
[56:17] about that and so those are tears we'd
[56:19] say of just perversion because the real
[56:22] home is going to being real tears - the
[56:24] life of Jesus Christ that's something
[56:27] worth crying about amen is the future
[56:30] home that Christ went to repair to your
[56:33] liking amen amen
[56:36] glory we don't cry overnight I mean
[56:39] natural things might help it might shed
[56:41] a few tears over things like that but
[56:42] the real whole work of the cry about is
[56:45] the future home amen
[56:46] the home that Christ Himself constructed
[56:49] hallelujah exactly right there should be
[56:53] no more death see there has to be the
[56:55] white throne judgment first where where
[56:57] all the demons and the unbelievers the
[56:59] goats are cast and death happens death
[57:02] has to happen separation has to happen
[57:04] but once the future home
[57:06] there is no more death amen neither
[57:10] sorrow nor crying neither shall there be
[57:12] any more pain for the former things are
[57:14] passed away so this is the last point of
[57:19] Tears as far as we can see in the
[57:20] scripture now there may be afterwards
[57:23] now I do have to apologize I made a
[57:24] mistake I preached on Wednesday and I
[57:26] said that there will be no more Sun in
[57:28] the future home and that's wrong the
[57:30] Bible doesn't actually say that the
[57:32] Bible said they'll have no need of the
[57:33] Sun so forgive me on that I preach
[57:36] something wrong
[57:37] so I caught I caught myself saying it
[57:39] and I wanted to stop and check it but I
[57:41] just kind of moved on but I didn't make
[57:43] a mistake there the Bible never said
[57:45] there'll be no Sun it just says there's
[57:46] no need of the Sun so there may be a Sun
[57:49] there I imagine the people that aren't
[57:50] in the future home the nations around
[57:52] the earth if we get a picture a global
[57:54] picture in our mind here if we look at
[57:56] the earth and there's nations scattered
[57:58] abroad the earth you want to bring their
[57:59] glory and honor to the future home I
[58:01] imagine you know if the world keeps
[58:03] turning they're gonna need a Sun but
[58:05] those that are in the future home have
[58:06] no need of the Sun because they're
[58:09] living close to Jesus and he is the
[58:11] light of the world amen they won't have
[58:14] need for the bride they have no need for
[58:16] the light because their dwelling with
[58:18] Christ now I want you to notice here God
[58:22] Himself is mentioned in revelation 21:3
[58:25] God Himself is mentioned a part of
[58:28] reading revelation 21 and 22 we see that
[58:30] the lamb and the Lord God Almighty are
[58:33] mentioned and notice it's an ants this
[58:35] is where Trinitarians might stumble and
[58:37] I saw no temple therein for those Lord
[58:40] God Almighty and the lamb are the temple
[58:43] of it so see Trinitarians look at this
[58:45] verse and they see two people I don't
[58:48] know where their third is though they're
[58:49] because you won't find the third in
[58:51] Revelation 21 22 you won't find a dove
[58:53] and then an old man and a young man you
[58:55] won't find that so see there's no
[58:58] mentions of separate persons or separate
[59:00] Thrones so we must look to further
[59:03] witnesses to understand it now the Bible
[59:05] does say and the spirit and the bride
[59:07] say come but there's no mention of a
[59:10] physical dove flying around you know
[59:12] hovering over the Sun or anything like
[59:14] that and so we understand that the Bible
[59:18] says no man can
[59:19] ever see God God is the invisible spirit
[59:23] we will never see God the Father for he
[59:27] is invisible spirit the Holy Spirit
[59:29] brother BAM talks about and says God is
[59:31] a spirit yes how many understands that
[59:33] God's a spirit Jesus is a man and Jesus
[59:36] was God made flesh we could never see
[59:38] God he's a spirit you can't see spirit
[59:41] no man has seen God at any time now the
[59:44] Bible says who Jesus is the image of the
[59:48] invisible God the firstborn of every
[59:51] creature amen
[59:53] Saint John wrote twice no man has seen
[59:56] God at any time he said that he quotes
[59:59] it verbatim twice no man has seen God at
[1:00:02] any time so see the God whom no man has
[1:00:09] seen or can see as is the Lord God
[1:00:11] Almighty so see the lamb is the image of
[1:00:14] the Lord God Almighty in Revelation 21
[1:00:17] 22 now some people stumble over this
[1:00:19] Jacob said I've seen God face to face as
[1:00:23] they say oh I can see God face to face
[1:00:25] but you failed II read the rest of the
[1:00:27] scripture the Bible said he had power
[1:00:30] over the angel and prevailed he never
[1:00:34] saw God the Father face-to-face he saw
[1:00:37] an angel face-to-face understand what
[1:00:39] we're talking about Jacob wrestled a
[1:00:41] manifestation of God it was God we'd say
[1:00:44] in a form of an angel or a form of God
[1:00:47] or an angel of God but the Bible said no
[1:00:50] man can see God and live with me praise
[1:00:54] God he himself will live with us in that
[1:00:58] heavenly City and it won't be two
[1:00:59] persons it certainly won't be three
[1:01:01] persons we will see just the Lamb of God
[1:01:04] amen
[1:01:04] he is the image of the invisible God but
[1:01:08] see people stumble remember God laid it
[1:01:10] in there because people who wanna
[1:01:12] stumble they need something to stumble
[1:01:13] over to the summer over Trinity they'll
[1:01:16] stumble over sin they'll stumble over
[1:01:18] this though some over that they got to
[1:01:20] have something to stumble over so God
[1:01:22] leaves that there in the scripture so he
[1:01:26] saw a manifestation of God face-to-face
[1:01:30] praise God
[1:01:33] finished revelation 22 and there shall
[1:01:35] be no more curse but the throne of God
[1:01:38] and of the Lamb so see the lamb is the
[1:01:40] image of God shall be in it and his
[1:01:42] servants shall serve Him and they shall
[1:01:45] see look at this his face not faces and
[1:01:50] his name shall be in their foreheads to
[1:01:54] see God in the lamb share one throne
[1:01:56] there's not a mention of two Thrones
[1:01:58] it's one throne
[1:01:59] his face is singular his name is
[1:02:02] singular the throne of God is singular
[1:02:05] that's because God is one singular
[1:02:07] person amen
[1:02:08] now after reading the future home
[1:02:10] brother band said how wonderful all of
[1:02:12] God's wonderful promises fulfilled it
[1:02:15] will be all over the change will have
[1:02:18] been completed the lamb and his bride
[1:02:21] forever settled in all the perfections
[1:02:23] of God talk about a settling think about
[1:02:27] the settlers that moved out lesson and
[1:02:29] they got the West settled thinking about
[1:02:31] you if you have a home and you got to
[1:02:33] settle your home and knock down the
[1:02:34] woods and you get settled what a nice
[1:02:37] feeling is to move in and be settled in
[1:02:38] your new place right how many like to
[1:02:41] feel settled you and I will not feel
[1:02:44] settled until that city lands upon that
[1:02:46] Jerusalem area and we move in with our
[1:02:49] heavenly bridegroom amen that's what
[1:02:52] we're finally gonna feel with settled
[1:02:54] praise God amen we can move on it feels
[1:02:58] like everything's perfect well you can
[1:03:00] get settled in the future home praise
[1:03:03] God can you describe it by Jesse no
[1:03:06] who's able to do that nobody not even
[1:03:09] brother Brandon think about it dream
[1:03:12] about it read what the word says about
[1:03:14] it yes we can do all of that yet we can
[1:03:16] only know and infant is amol I don't
[1:03:19] even know if I'm saying that right part
[1:03:20] of it just a small part of it until it
[1:03:24] becomes a reality in the first
[1:03:26] resurrection
[1:03:26] so once the rapture happens we finally
[1:03:29] get a reality of what this perfection is
[1:03:32] going to be like it won't be complete
[1:03:34] but we'll have a will have another taste
[1:03:36] of the change that God is bringing to
[1:03:39] this world and this universe oh my the
[1:03:43] perfections of God become a reality in
[1:03:45] the first resurrection
[1:03:47] or the rapture this is because death is
[1:03:49] swallowed up in victory our dying bodies
[1:03:52] are slowed up by eternal bodies we
[1:03:54] experience a part of the change but
[1:03:56] there's more change to come for the
[1:03:58] earth because the Bible says the moments
[1:04:01] when command-i we shall all be changed
[1:04:03] amen and the Bible says in second
[1:04:05] Corinthians 5 for we know that if our
[1:04:07] earthly house of this Tabernacle beat us
[1:04:09] off we have a building of God a house
[1:04:11] not made with hands eternal in the
[1:04:13] heavens
[1:04:15] for in this we groan are you groaning
[1:04:18] for a perfect body are you groaning to
[1:04:20] be perfect you have to be Paul was
[1:04:23] groaning for it are we groaning for more
[1:04:26] pleasures of the earth we ought to be
[1:04:28] groaning for that future home we ought
[1:04:30] to be groaning for a perfect body we
[1:04:32] ought to be groaning for victory over
[1:04:33] yourself
[1:04:34] we ought to be groaning for that that's
[1:04:36] a policy we groan earnestly desiring to
[1:04:40] be clothed upon with our house he said
[1:04:43] which is from heaven now remember once
[1:04:46] you get your new body
[1:04:47] it's eternal even in a perfect glorified
[1:04:51] body we can cry and also eat like Jesus
[1:04:54] at the Raps remember we get a
[1:04:56] combination of three bodies the
[1:04:57] glorified the celestial and the
[1:04:59] theophany or the terrestrial they caught
[1:05:01] all three arm unite to come one because
[1:05:05] life the glorified swallows up the
[1:05:08] regular body aim and the earthly body
[1:05:10] and so see emotions are still part of
[1:05:13] the human spirit and our human spirit
[1:05:15] remains intact to some degree because
[1:05:17] we're still able to cry with brand-new
[1:05:19] bodies were able to eat weren't able to
[1:05:21] do all these things we're gonna remain
[1:05:23] human praise God the only thing that's
[1:05:25] going to change is our bodies but we're
[1:05:27] taking our character with us amen I'm
[1:05:30] still going to be a pastor over there as
[1:05:32] far as a preacher you're still going to
[1:05:33] be a faithful a woman or a faithful man
[1:05:36] or whatever God's called you to be
[1:05:37] whatever you are here that's what you'll
[1:05:39] be an eternity amen
[1:05:41] it's just that all of the death is
[1:05:43] swallowed up in life and at the rapture
[1:05:46] we'll have the first taste of perfection
[1:05:49] but we won't feel complete until that
[1:05:52] city comes out and we feel settled in
[1:05:54] our home amen you know I won't feel
[1:05:57] complete we won't have the name written
[1:05:58] on us of the new heavenly City
[1:06:00] we won't have that yet Christ hasn't
[1:06:02] revealed that yet he hasn't revealed his
[1:06:04] new name yet he hasn't revealed these
[1:06:06] things that's why we feel unsettled
[1:06:08] because we know there's prophecy still
[1:06:10] to be filled amen
[1:06:11] we know there's a name that we're still
[1:06:13] going to be called by whereas that we
[1:06:14] desire to be called by the new name of
[1:06:16] Jesus amen Oh hallelujah now this is
[1:06:24] where Jesus says my new name and I'll
[1:06:26] write my new name upon him my new name
[1:06:30] when all becomes new when he will take
[1:06:33] upon him a new name and that name will
[1:06:35] be the name of the bride also what the
[1:06:37] name is none dare conjecture so a church
[1:06:41] it's not even worth our time trying to
[1:06:43] figure it out I don't want to hear your
[1:06:46] guesses about what the new name is I
[1:06:47] don't care because none dare to
[1:06:50] conjecture that see we were many times
[1:06:54] people in the message you know we try to
[1:06:56] be as spiritual as brother branham right
[1:06:59] because we know more about prophets and
[1:07:01] if we're not careful sometimes we try to
[1:07:03] inch our way and to be more spiritual we
[1:07:06] make ourselves Mystics mysterious let's
[1:07:10] just be honest if we don't know let's
[1:07:12] just say we don't know but see the
[1:07:15] reality of it is how many people come
[1:07:16] out when they really say I got the state
[1:07:18] the Lord then it comes to pass that's
[1:07:19] real spiritual activity right there when
[1:07:22] you can prophesy when you say you've got
[1:07:24] the state the Lord it comes to pass now
[1:07:26] you're getting real spiritual now that's
[1:07:29] real that's real discernment of the
[1:07:33] sphere we'd say but let's not try to be
[1:07:35] a mystical that's where all the churches
[1:07:37] get off when they try to figure
[1:07:39] something out before it's God's time to
[1:07:40] reveal it let's not try to inject
[1:07:43] ourselves let's not try to presume and
[1:07:45] try to figure something out that God
[1:07:47] hasn't revealed to it let's just wait
[1:07:49] upon the Lord as we said on Wednesday
[1:07:52] how many got plenty of patience Noah had
[1:07:55] plenty of 120 years of patience I could
[1:07:58] wait a few more years for the new name
[1:07:59] I'll have to try to figure that out I'm
[1:08:01] gonna try to figure out the seven
[1:08:03] thunders like other brothers have done
[1:08:04] and led people astray right now we know
[1:08:08] what the seven thunders are but we know
[1:08:10] the other group that went to New York
[1:08:12] and I'm not going to name names but we
[1:08:13] know that grew
[1:08:14] had the wrong interpretation how do you
[1:08:16] know look at their fruits at the end
[1:08:18] they were worshipping the man who
[1:08:20] started the movement they listened to
[1:08:22] his tapes only not brother branham and
[1:08:25] there was prophecy saying up that he
[1:08:27] would rise from again from the dead
[1:08:29] three days later he did it his sons got
[1:08:32] arrested and the brothers the pastor's
[1:08:34] there in North Carolina saw on TV saw
[1:08:36] the Internet they got arrested for money
[1:08:38] embezzlement adulteries in the church
[1:08:40] see the fruit of it show what was behind
[1:08:43] that revelation praise God the fruit of
[1:08:47] it the fruit of our lives should say
[1:08:49] holiness the fruit of our I should say
[1:08:52] godliness amen
[1:08:54] the fruit of our lives should say
[1:08:55] faithfulness to the Word of God amen
[1:08:58] but we don't try to inject something
[1:09:00] into it make it Marcel's more spiritual
[1:09:03] or more mystic or more mysterious let's
[1:09:05] just be solid sound stable settled
[1:09:08] Christians amen let's just be so
[1:09:11] grounded in the truth and every day
[1:09:12] we're a Holy Ghost field child of God we
[1:09:14] laws we know is that we love Jesus more
[1:09:16] and more every day praise God
[1:09:18] amen none day or make a guest about the
[1:09:22] new name don't even dare you know I know
[1:09:24] people they have said you know Lord
[1:09:25] Branham Christ they've done stuff like
[1:09:26] that I've heard that online i've i've
[1:09:27] seen the websites online they say that's
[1:09:29] the new name shame on them that's false
[1:09:32] doctrine isn't awful it's awful some of
[1:09:36] the brothers like brother Devon Karen he
[1:09:38] knew people that were baptized the name
[1:09:39] of William Marion Branham it's awful you
[1:09:42] see what it is they're trying to inject
[1:09:44] something they're trying to be spiritual
[1:09:46] when they're not praise the Lord
[1:09:49] but whose spiritual those who fear that
[1:09:51] God and keep his commands you want to be
[1:09:54] more spiritual start being more fearful
[1:09:55] of God start recognizing more sin around
[1:09:58] you that you can cast it down and live
[1:10:00] above it be a king on this earth reign
[1:10:04] over sin in your life go into the boxing
[1:10:07] ring every day and defeat your flesh
[1:10:09] that's how you're a real spiritual
[1:10:11] person remember spiritual meat belongs
[1:10:13] to those who what they do they have
[1:10:16] discernment they can discern good and
[1:10:17] evil corny Hebrews chapter five remember
[1:10:19] that that is somebody who's ready for me
[1:10:21] preaching I was preaching that at the
[1:10:25] middle school a Bible Club
[1:10:27] and I said that's why I said I said me
[1:10:29] preaching is when you can discern is
[1:10:31] this of God or not and a boy raised and
[1:10:33] said but mr. Smith
[1:10:34] he said his Star Wars of God I said let
[1:10:39] your I said talk to her mom about that
[1:10:41] because I know his dad passed away but I
[1:10:44] said dr. mom about that but I said if
[1:10:46] you want his name was Luke I said you if
[1:10:48] you want Luke we can do a lesson on that
[1:10:50] and real spiritual maturity it examines
[1:10:54] everything in your life to see it's of
[1:10:56] God or not I love that phrase god I love
[1:11:01] it so even even a child he's in fifth
[1:11:03] grade even a child can understand this
[1:11:05] thing if this message is so simple what
[1:11:08] is it it's just back to the word it's
[1:11:10] the word though and I read this book
[1:11:11] yesterday on modesty and I was so
[1:11:13] blessed by but church this book has a
[1:11:15] lot less scripture than I have in my
[1:11:16] book already and not that not that I'm
[1:11:20] exalting you know my mind it may never
[1:11:22] get the print I don't know I hope it
[1:11:24] does but I'm just saying like we have so
[1:11:27] much more word because God has restored
[1:11:29] the word back to us I was just I was
[1:11:32] blessed by what I saw but I was also
[1:11:34] concerned they're so little there it's
[1:11:36] more just thoughts and and history and
[1:11:38] idea which is fine if it lines up with
[1:11:40] the word but we should be able to dig
[1:11:42] down in the word and find more a word
[1:11:43] that we can prove the faith by amen
[1:11:46] the Bible said have an answer for every
[1:11:48] man who asks for the hope of God within
[1:11:51] you be ready to give an answer sanctify
[1:11:53] the Lord God in your hearts and be
[1:11:55] always ready to give an answer for the
[1:11:56] hope you have within you that's why I
[1:11:58] did those videos if someone three times
[1:12:00] this week people from overseas from satu
[1:12:02] from South Africa said well Jessie what
[1:12:03] do you feel about the Holy Ghost what do
[1:12:04] you feel about this and I just said them
[1:12:06] links to my YouTube video I don't have
[1:12:07] time to sit there and talk to them for
[1:12:09] thirty minutes about it but I can point
[1:12:10] with that so those videos have taught me
[1:12:12] that that's a nice way to have an answer
[1:12:15] just real briefly I can give to somebody
[1:12:17] always have an answer what is evidence
[1:12:19] of the Holy Ghost what is this what what
[1:12:21] is the three works of grace how do you
[1:12:23] know where the man was a prophet so if I
[1:12:24] don't have time I can say right there it
[1:12:26] is that's our answer with meekness and
[1:12:28] in fear glory it would have to be a
[1:12:33] revelation of the spirit of the new name
[1:12:35] given so conclusively that none would
[1:12:38] dare even deny it
[1:12:40] so no one can guess and then no one will
[1:12:43] deny it in other words God will reveal
[1:12:46] it to the bride and every bride member
[1:12:48] will believe it
[1:12:49] praise God but no bride member is gonna
[1:12:53] guess at it amen
[1:12:54] no bride member will guess but every
[1:12:56] bride member will receive the new name
[1:12:58] of Jesus amen but no doubt he'll leave
[1:13:01] that revelation to the day when he
[1:13:03] desires to give that name forth it's up
[1:13:05] to him
[1:13:07] suffice it to know that it will be more
[1:13:09] wonderful than we could ever imagine
[1:13:12] look at that new name me don't even
[1:13:14] think about it
[1:13:16] don't try to conjecture don't try to
[1:13:19] inject your own thought that's what Eve
[1:13:20] did injecting her own thought of course
[1:13:22] it was Satan's thought first we know
[1:13:23] that now did you know he's gonna give
[1:13:26] Israel new name you know that that's go
[1:13:29] to Isaiah 62 this morning I was studying
[1:13:32] on this and I thought you know I'm gonna
[1:13:33] just type a new name and see if it shows
[1:13:35] up anywhere else in the Bible and it
[1:13:37] sure did
[1:13:38] God's gonna give the 144,000 a new name
[1:13:44] Isaiah 62 1 through 5 oh I just love the
[1:13:47] Word of God Isaiah 62 1 through 5 for
[1:13:59] Zions sake will I not hold my peace and
[1:14:00] produce some sake I will not rest until
[1:14:02] the righteousness therefore go forth as
[1:14:05] a brightness and the salvation thereof
[1:14:08] as a lamp that Burness see God's not
[1:14:13] gonna rest God's not gonna rest until
[1:14:15] all of Israel's say aren't you glad
[1:14:17] about that
[1:14:17] God's not gonna rest until this message
[1:14:20] goes around the world
[1:14:21] amen first - and the Gentiles shall see

[1:15:31] over the Gentiles as well don't you

[1:15:38] choosing to come out of layer to see you

[1:16:00] hallelujah so see she receives a new
[1:16:04] name the Gentiles are going to notice is
[1:16:05] the Gentiles shall see the righteousness
[1:16:08] of Israel how they loo you have the
[1:16:13] final admonition here I'm almost done
[1:16:14] here it's a familiar one he that hath an
[1:16:21] ear let him hear what the spirit saith
[1:16:24] to the churches I want you to pay
[1:16:27] special attention this paragraph here
[1:16:29] every age ends with the same warning it
[1:16:32] is the constant plea that the churches
[1:16:37] listen to the voice of the Lord constant
[1:16:41] in this age the plea is even more
[1:16:46] insistent now that you will find that
[1:16:48] written the scripture but brother man
[1:16:49] picks it up by the Holy Spirit and said
[1:16:51] it's more insistent which is it actually
[1:16:55] means more earnest or emphatic in
[1:16:59] dwelling upon or persistent the voice of
[1:17:04] the Holy Spirit is more dwelling
[1:17:06] on this thought in this age which is the
[1:17:09] Philadelphia Church age for in this age
[1:17:12] the coming of Lord truly draweth nigh
[1:17:15] the question would perhaps arise is
[1:17:18] there another age beyond this one why
[1:17:20] the urgency the answer lies here here in
[1:17:24] the last age will be a short one a quick
[1:17:27] work of consummation praise God so I
[1:17:33] want you to notice this I'm gonna break
[1:17:34] down these words constant insist in
[1:17:36] urgency you probably are familiar with
[1:17:37] them but let me break them down so you
[1:17:40] can feel what the prophets saying here
[1:17:42] constantly constant means not changing a
[1:17:45] regular plea which is an earnest request
[1:17:49] so the Holy Spirit is constantly saying
[1:17:52] this the Holy Spirit will regularly
[1:17:54] plead to you the Holy Spirit will will
[1:17:57] regularly give an earnest request and
[1:18:00] say hear the voice of your my voice hear
[1:18:03] my voice
[1:18:04] hear my voice it'll be regular to see
[1:18:08] when people get tired of coming to
[1:18:09] church they get tired to read their
[1:18:11] Bible they get tired of saying amen to
[1:18:13] the word be careful you might be you
[1:18:15] might be hushing the holy voice of
[1:18:17] Christ because he has a constantly he's
[1:18:21] constantly pleading with everyone the
[1:18:23] church age now more insistent means this
[1:18:27] insistent means earnest or emphatic and
[1:18:30] dwelling upon so the Holy Spirit just
[1:18:31] dwells upon this idea of hearing my
[1:18:34] voice hear my voice
[1:18:36] it's unchanging listen to my voice obey
[1:18:39] my voice
[1:18:40] obey my word it doesn't let up and the
[1:18:44] church said it's constant but and so you
[1:18:48] have to make sure it's you don't you
[1:18:50] don't transgress the voice the police is
[1:18:53] regular its unchanging it's constant
[1:18:56] saying obey me listen here obey the
[1:19:00] coming of the Lord is that hand amen
[1:19:02] it doesn't change preacher try to keep
[1:19:05] preached on these things it's not me
[1:19:07] preaching it it's the Holy Ghost inside
[1:19:09] me amen
[1:19:10] and every preacher that's really a god
[1:19:12] called preacher is the same way it's not
[1:19:17] the
[1:19:17] if the preacher gets under the anointing
[1:19:19] and the anointing brings them to a
[1:19:21] constantly and insistent request and a
[1:19:25] urgency where the spirits trying to
[1:19:28] compel you to make immediate action amen
[1:19:32] others don't leave this service the same
[1:19:34] way you gave go go closer to Christ amen
[1:19:39] and people think is just a yell a
[1:19:41] yelling shouting arrogant mean preacher
[1:19:43] but it's not the preacher it's the real
[1:19:46] preacher of the holy preacher the Holy
[1:19:48] Ghost amen
[1:19:49] because we are at the end time or
[1:19:54] literally at the end of the end I've
[1:19:57] heard it before then make some immediate
[1:19:59] action and make it fresh to your heart
[1:20:01] for it used to be fresh to your heart it
[1:20:03] needs to be fresh to your heart again
[1:20:05] you need to sense the urgency you and I
[1:20:08] need a sense the urgency the constant
[1:20:12] unchanging requests of the Holy Spirit
[1:20:14] obey my voice
[1:20:15] obey my voice listen to my voice
[1:20:20] remember this is the age of the open
[1:20:22] door this is why God has so much urgency
[1:20:24] remember the false Jews and the
[1:20:27] synagogue of satan' came in after the
[1:20:28] initial outpouring the Holy Ghost
[1:20:30] brother BAM said then Satan set up his
[1:20:32] seat for church and state married but
[1:20:34] BAM said it repeated in Luther's age
[1:20:36] there was a revival Reformation and then
[1:20:38] they organized the Lutheran's organized
[1:20:40] Mary church and state and then the
[1:20:42] synagogue of Satan and false Jews popped
[1:20:44] up but man said anyone that says they've
[1:20:48] got the Holy Ghost and claims to be the
[1:20:51] original book of Acts church but doesn't
[1:20:53] have it he said they're liars and
[1:20:55] they're false Jews amen
[1:20:57] think about all the churches say God is
[1:21:00] speaking our church this morning we're
[1:21:02] going again I see I see it on the signs
[1:21:04] yesterday when I was driving around
[1:21:05] we're a spirit-led church are you how do
[1:21:08] you know because you obey what the
[1:21:10] Spirit says in the word you hear the
[1:21:13] constant urgency immediate action make a
[1:21:17] change make a change today praise God do
[1:21:21] something in your life to make a change
[1:21:23] so you can obey that word that you know
[1:21:26] God is asking you to obey and he keeps
[1:21:30] repeating it over and over and as
[1:21:31] age gets longer he told Ephesus he that
[1:21:34] hath the ear let him hear
[1:21:35] he told summer the same thing and now
[1:21:37] he's getting down a brother and said now
[1:21:38] here thinner Philadelphia now it's even
[1:21:40] more urgent hear the voice obey the
[1:21:42] voice because it's the age of the open
[1:21:44] door the true God is walking through
[1:21:46] that door a man is walking through that
[1:21:48] door to the rapture hallelujah and so we
[1:21:51] must heed the constant steady insistent
[1:21:54] urgent voice of God Almighty how many
[1:21:58] people do you know I take the Word of
[1:21:59] God that's seriously well Jesse I can
[1:22:02] feel the urgency when you preach even on
[1:22:04] a Wednesday night can you I hope you can
[1:22:09] if not brother sister you've drifted
[1:22:13] away you drifted away you let yourself
[1:22:15] drift off through the storms of life
[1:22:17] somehow you've let the storms of life or
[1:22:19] trials distract you or rock you to sleep
[1:22:22] or something we must hear the urgency of
[1:22:24] the Holy Spirit saying hear my voice
[1:22:26] today I'm trying to talk to you today
[1:22:30] it's more urgent than last year 2017 and
[1:22:33] over just two weeks into the year but it
[1:22:36] should be more urgent it gets more
[1:22:37] urgent as we approach the coming of the
[1:22:39] Lord remember of course we know this but
[1:22:44] we'll get to that in just a moment this
[1:22:46] is the age of the open door the open
[1:22:48] door bo-ram said carried over from
[1:22:49] Philadelphia to our age because our age
[1:22:52] is a short age we don't know if it's the
[1:22:54] shortest but we know it's gonna be a
[1:22:56] short age because the Bible said the
[1:22:58] Bible said God has to shorten the days
[1:23:00] that the elect that some election be
[1:23:03] saved
[1:23:03] he's shortening Laodicea yet the end at
[1:23:08] the same time all the time that he gives
[1:23:10] is his long-suffering he's so merciful
[1:23:12] he's so long-suffering go to Acts
[1:23:16] chapter 20 here I just want to bring
[1:23:17] this thought out here I've read it
[1:23:19] before on a couple occasions I want to
[1:23:22] read Acts chapter 20 again Paul is
[1:23:25] leaving Ephesus and these brothers know
[1:23:29] he's going to go be a martyr in Rome
[1:23:31] they know it AGGA buses prophesied
[1:23:33] different ones have prophesied in fact
[1:23:35] the Bible said every place Paul went
[1:23:36] there was prophecy that he had to go to
[1:23:38] Rome to die so they know he's going to
[1:23:42] leave
[1:23:44] and you know the story but let's look at
[1:23:47] verse 25 acts 20 25 and now behold I
[1:23:52] know that ye are among whom I have gone
[1:23:54] preaching the kingdom of God shall see
[1:23:55] my face no more I'll never see you again
[1:23:57] on this side in other words he was
[1:23:58] saying wherefore take you to record this
[1:24:01] day that I am pure from the blood of all
[1:24:03] men see preachers the blood is on our
[1:24:06] hands that's why I've got a preach heart
[1:24:08] that's right that's why every preacher
[1:24:10] has to preach heart because your blood
[1:24:11] is on my hands
[1:24:13] praise God verse 27 for I have not
[1:24:18] shunned to declare unto you all the
[1:24:20] counsel of God take heed therefore unto
[1:24:23] yourselves and to all the flock which
[1:24:25] over which the Holy Ghost has made you
[1:24:27] overseers to feed the Church of God
[1:24:29] which he hath purchased with his own
[1:24:31] blood for I notice that after my
[1:24:34] departing shall Grievous wolves enter in
[1:24:36] among you not sparing the flock and also
[1:24:39] of your own selves shall men arise
[1:24:40] speaking perverse things to draw away
[1:24:43] disciples after them so see that not
[1:24:45] only were they gonna get attacked from
[1:24:47] wolves from the outside but Satan was
[1:24:49] gonna anoint somebody on the inside as
[1:24:50] well he's gonna send in outward battles
[1:24:53] and he's gonna anoint somebody on the
[1:24:55] inside to try to get them but the real
[1:24:57] trouble a believer stays faithful amen
[1:25:01] Paul knew it's gonna come Paul knew
[1:25:02] Satan's gonna send him invaders in
[1:25:04] imposters in wolves in but he also knew
[1:25:07] there's gonna be trouble
[1:25:08] we're from within the Saints that's
[1:25:11] right look at verse 31 and haughty well
[1:25:17] verse 30 how do you know they're gonna
[1:25:18] draw people after themselves instead of
[1:25:19] the word try to get their own disciples
[1:25:22] therefore watch and remember that by the
[1:25:25] space of three years I ceased not to
[1:25:27] warn every one of you day night and day
[1:25:30] with tears can everybody see how the
[1:25:36] Holy Spirit gave constant urgent
[1:25:41] warnings to Ephesus can anybody see that
[1:25:43] before the Prophet left for three years
[1:25:45] he was crying apparently night and day
[1:25:47] he was so burdened he knew wolves were
[1:25:49] coming in why didn't he stop after one
[1:25:52] year why didn't he just do one year of
[1:25:54] crying and warning
[1:25:57] couldn't stop because the Holy Spirit
[1:25:58] was inside of him brother Bram said the
[1:26:01] plea to he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:26:04] what the Holy Spirit saying that plea
[1:26:07] just gets more urgent
[1:26:09] it gets more important we must take heed
[1:26:13] to it the same thing happened in Paul's
[1:26:15] life amen
[1:26:16] Paul's had to keep warning them warning
[1:26:18] them remember brother Branham warned the
[1:26:20] tabernacle he said the tabernacle he
[1:26:22] said you'll lose your strength he told
[1:26:24] the random tabernacle that they'll lose
[1:26:25] their strength there was multiple
[1:26:28] warnings I've heard a brother preach on
[1:26:29] one time there's multiple warnings just
[1:26:31] over the course of the years just
[1:26:33] warning random Tabernacle and how many
[1:26:35] times of the Prophet warned you know
[1:26:37] people on the tapes but see a real man
[1:26:40] of God his warning increased his urgency
[1:26:45] increased
[1:26:47] now how many who got upset said the
[1:26:50] preacher preached on the same thing he
[1:26:52] warned us again for the second month in
[1:26:55] a row about wolves coming and brother
[1:26:58] Paul
[1:26:58] pastor Paul there's no wolves among us
[1:27:00] he wasn't talking about right then he
[1:27:04] saying get yourself out in the Word of
[1:27:06] God they're coming in when I leave it's
[1:27:10] been two and a half years and the
[1:27:12] Prophet has preached the same thing over
[1:27:15] and over again one time someone was so
[1:27:16] critical on brother brand they said and
[1:27:18] I listened all these sermons from 6465
[1:27:20] and alls I hear is about Abraham and the
[1:27:23] last sign and and seven letters and
[1:27:26] Branham and they were so critical a
[1:27:27] brother branham and they said they got
[1:27:31] so tired of hearing about Genesis 18
[1:27:34] where God in flesh came to Abraham and
[1:27:37] Sarah's tent why did they get critical
[1:27:41] church they got critical because the
[1:27:43] Holy Spirit was trying to show brother
[1:27:46] brandon as he traveled around he felt
[1:27:48] letting the Holy Spirit to warn them
[1:27:50] you're seeing your last sign get right
[1:27:52] with God recognize the discernment the
[1:27:56] same discernment that was on the son of
[1:27:58] man is on a son a man and that constant
[1:28:01] warning finally lo this person to sleep
[1:28:04] until they left the message after the
[1:28:07] threat of the other husband leaving them
[1:28:08] they leave they leave it and because
[1:28:10] they Krita
[1:28:10] sighs oh brother man just warning and
[1:28:12] look the Bible said a prophet warned
[1:28:14] them the same thing for three years
[1:28:18] there's going to be wolves coming in
[1:28:20] what's wrong with God anointing a
[1:28:21] prophet to say the a son of man is here
[1:28:24] a son of man is here for the body change
[1:28:28] saya has to receive strength and she's
[1:28:30] got to be corrected by the son of man
[1:28:32] hallelujah
[1:28:33] she had to be corrected by these son of
[1:28:35] man but the same today he's got to be
[1:28:37] corrected by a son a man hallelujah
[1:28:39] she's got to recognize the last side
[1:28:41] before the body change of people get
[1:28:43] tired of that the same people got tired
[1:28:45] of Paul service after service wolves are
[1:28:49] coming wolves are coming you better get
[1:28:52] stronger you better feed on the Word of
[1:28:54] God just like people today get tired the
[1:28:57] tribulation is coming the tribulations
[1:29:00] come we're in Laodicea
[1:29:01] we're later see and it actually loves
[1:29:03] them to sleep because they silence the
[1:29:05] voice of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:29:08] it's a constant urgent insist simply
[1:29:12] hear my voice obey my voice don't say
[1:29:16] the same because you won't say the same
[1:29:18] you cannot stay the same you're either
[1:29:21] growing closer or further away so the
[1:29:26] same people that criticize brother
[1:29:27] Branham the same ones that leave the
[1:29:30] same one that bleed brother BAM loved
[1:29:32] homosexuals because Leo and Jean became
[1:29:34] homosexuals that brother maybe brother
[1:29:35] brand they they said maybe brother
[1:29:36] Branham was homosexual shame on them
[1:29:39] the same voice that's warning them the
[1:29:42] last signs here thus say at the Lord the
[1:29:44] last signs here you'll see no greater
[1:29:45] side the Gentiles were see no greater
[1:29:47] sign they get tired of that they don't
[1:29:50] want to hear the warning of the Holy
[1:29:51] Spirit but the true believer will hear
[1:29:53] it and do something about it amen see
[1:29:57] st. Paul warned them day and night for
[1:29:58] three years with tears he was warning
[1:30:02] them because church the deeds of the
[1:30:04] Nicolaitans Paul knew it was coming in
[1:30:08] what were the deeds again the deeds of
[1:30:10] the Nicolaitans remember what they did
[1:30:11] they exalted the preachers above the
[1:30:13] laity and now Leia T ruled over
[1:30:16] everybody and then they had sorry then
[1:30:19] preachers ruled over everybody and then
[1:30:20] preachers made themselves rulers over
[1:30:22] preachers
[1:30:24] why I'm free in Christ here no one rules
[1:30:26] me but the Holy Ghost
[1:30:27] I'll take advice I'll take thoughts but
[1:30:30] I'm the one who's got to take it before
[1:30:31] the Lord in prayer let me say like this
[1:30:34] as I've said it before the deeds of the
[1:30:36] Nicolaitans makes everybody and the
[1:30:38] audience feel like only one person has
[1:30:40] to be anointed the preacher that is the
[1:30:43] deeds of Nicolaitans because they're
[1:30:44] conquering
[1:30:45] the laity that's why you got to come
[1:30:48] here and pray and you got to pray at
[1:30:50] your home remember that email gave you
[1:30:51] last week you got to pray at home and
[1:30:53] come early to pray here you've got to
[1:30:55] bring the oil you've got to have an
[1:30:57] anointing
[1:30:58] I've got to be just as anointed as you I
[1:31:00] praise God we've all got to be anointed
[1:31:02] Paul cried for three years saying only
[1:31:04] the preachers going to feel anointed
[1:31:05] only the preachers wolves are going to
[1:31:07] come in they're going to scatter the
[1:31:08] flock everybody needs the anointing of
[1:31:10] the Holy Ghost and fire because the Holy
[1:31:13] Ghost and fire will keep you alive amen
[1:31:15] Mary so he warned number three years
[1:31:20] they're going to come take all the Holy
[1:31:21] Ghost out of the people the people are
[1:31:23] going to be led of the Holy Spirit
[1:31:24] anymore the people just going to sit
[1:31:26] there and try to absorb preach to me
[1:31:28] preacher try to stir me up you've got to
[1:31:30] stir yourself up David encouraged
[1:31:34] himself in the Lord you got let the word
[1:31:37] comfort you've got to let the word stir
[1:31:39] you up on some of the amen on Friday had
[1:31:41] the day off from work cos of snow and he
[1:31:44] said how you doing I said I'm doing real
[1:31:45] good and we're talking about just
[1:31:47] struggles and things that you know
[1:31:49] things we battled I said brother I said
[1:31:50] I woke up this morning and I didn't feel
[1:31:52] one bit spiritual I woke up and I just
[1:31:54] felt like a dead carcass walking around
[1:31:56] I I didn't feel no anointing or nothing
[1:31:59] but you know what I got into the ring I
[1:32:01] stepped in the ring now you you didn't
[1:32:03] see me go like this you know like
[1:32:05] brother Kevin used to do you didn't see
[1:32:06] me do that but what I did I come down
[1:32:08] into my ring onto my knees in prayer and
[1:32:10] the first couple of prayers the words
[1:32:12] out didn't mean much to me I felt like
[1:32:15] you're just going through the motions
[1:32:16] and I said yes that's right devil I am
[1:32:18] going to go through the motions until
[1:32:19] Christ gives me more emotion glory I
[1:32:23] told my the Amen I said that's what the
[1:32:25] bat some days I woke up like this
[1:32:26] morning I wake up real spiritual mind
[1:32:28] and ready to go ready to study get up at
[1:32:29] 5:30 I'm ready to go I'm primed to go
[1:32:31] but Thursday I didn't wake up with any
[1:32:33] of that I had to step into the ring and
[1:32:35] sour meat myself up again
[1:32:37] so I start trying to knock myself out
[1:32:39] knock out the flesh and so pretty soon I
[1:32:42] started Anderson in interceding for
[1:32:44] people and as soon as I started praying
[1:32:46] for the people the tears came amen the
[1:32:49] sincerity came the victory came the ilis
[1:32:52] II was prayer of intercession I had to
[1:32:54] stop thinking about myself and start
[1:32:56] thinking about other people amen
[1:32:58] and that's what God used that day to
[1:33:00] stir me up and so I when I finally went
[1:33:03] to brother see a brother brother amen I
[1:33:04] read my Bible I'd prayed I've tried I've
[1:33:06] been on fire for Lord and we had a good
[1:33:08] old fellowship there by God's grace I
[1:33:10] really enjoyed that
[1:33:13] oh.sorry jumped ahead there sorry I
[1:33:15] didn't mean to do that I think I only
[1:33:16] tapped it when I was preaching so
[1:33:17] forgive me Lisa I didn't break it though
[1:33:19] praise the Lord you see we've got to
[1:33:23] have an anointing I'm gonna skip past
[1:33:24] this cuz I preach on real hearing
[1:33:25] recently hearing is doing if you came a
[1:33:28] church and you don't change anything
[1:33:29] you didn't hear one thing the preacher
[1:33:30] said but if you go home and change
[1:33:33] something you heard what he said hey
[1:33:35] what the Holy Spirit said are you with
[1:33:37] me you got to change something your life
[1:33:39] in other words all I got to be more
[1:33:40] dedicated tomorrow morning or I've got
[1:33:42] to make sure I pray more tonight so
[1:33:43] tomorrow morning when I wake up I'll be
[1:33:44] more focused on God you've got to change
[1:33:47] something got to draw closer to Christ
[1:33:50] now this idea about warning the warning
[1:33:55] it's more urgent more intense as the
[1:33:57] preaching goes on as time goes on jesus
[1:34:00] said the Holy Spirit will say hear me
[1:34:01] hear what other spirits say here and
[1:34:03] it's supposed to get more urgent it got
[1:34:05] more urgent in the days of Israel I'm
[1:34:07] know that and even Jesus and I didn't
[1:34:11] had time to study this I'd have time to
[1:34:13] say this remember Jesus even foretold
[1:34:15] his death many times he's just kept
[1:34:18] urgently saying I'm gonna have to go to
[1:34:19] Jerusalem they're gonna have to kill me
[1:34:21] I'm gonna be delivering the hands of
[1:34:22] Gentile sinful men and the Bible said
[1:34:24] they didn't remember until after the
[1:34:25] resurrection he kept warning he kept
[1:34:28] warning they're gonna try to scatter you
[1:34:29] like sheep they're gonna smite the
[1:34:31] Shepherd that the Sheep might be
[1:34:33] scattered
[1:34:33] he kept warning them and it just went
[1:34:35] over their heads over their heads Church
[1:34:37] I don't want to go over my head I don't
[1:34:39] want the voice of the Holy Spirit to go
[1:34:40] over my head I want to go into my heart
[1:34:42] amen glory
[1:34:44] I want to go in my ears and in my heart
[1:34:46] so I'm making ready for the coming of
[1:34:48] the Lord it's not getting less
[1:34:51] the urgency is getting more urgent
[1:34:54] because there's fewer and fewer people
[1:34:57] actually going to be saved there's fewer
[1:34:59] people that are going to walk through
[1:35:01] that open door we're living in the last
[1:35:03] minutes of history the last the doors
[1:35:06] almost closed they men for the Gentiles
[1:35:10] so can you see the pattern I just had a
[1:35:13] few minutes look at this yesterday look
[1:35:14] at this this is a nice visual here's the
[1:35:16] Kings here's the kings of Israel
[1:35:22] now notice Moses warned them in 1500 BC
[1:35:25] if you don't keep the commands your you
[1:35:28] won't be so you won't stay in the land
[1:35:29] very long they were warned before they
[1:35:32] got in let me know God's interested in
[1:35:35] giving warnings warning warning warning
[1:35:38] warning warning
[1:35:40] God gave warnings before they even got
[1:35:42] there and then once they get in there
[1:35:46] what happens you know they get divided
[1:35:47] Solomon goes to idolatry and his two
[1:35:50] sons ray of balm and Jeroboam the
[1:35:52] kingdom is divided so see before they're
[1:35:55] carried away real foreign sin there
[1:35:57] comes a division that's why Saint loves
[1:36:00] to divide churches well if he can divide
[1:36:03] that group he can lead them away into
[1:36:05] the wilderness of sin he has to divide
[1:36:09] them first
[1:36:10] that's what the deeds of Nicolaitans
[1:36:11] that had divided the preachers from the
[1:36:13] laity only the preachers are anointed I
[1:36:15] hope you're anointed this morning I I
[1:36:17] hope somebody's at north of this morning
[1:36:19] Amen I don't want to be just me I feel
[1:36:22] the urgency the Holy Spirit but
[1:36:23] everybody needs to feel that everybody
[1:36:26] has to feel that and then Samaria fell
[1:36:30] and 740 BC the Assyrian captivity the
[1:36:33] fool that just the city fell there the
[1:36:35] whole Assyrian captivity took over all
[1:36:37] of the Northern Kingdom of Israel in 722
[1:36:40] now look Church God gave them warning
[1:36:42] after warning Joel Amos Hosea Micah
[1:36:47] Isaiah God gave them warning after
[1:36:50] warning don't you love it
[1:36:53] God comes in here gives us been the rod
[1:36:55] to warn us he gives us brother Jesse to
[1:36:58] warn us brother Simon brother Brooks
[1:37:01] brother Craig hallelujah brother Matt
[1:37:04] lightener
[1:37:05] God brings all these warnings hear the
[1:37:08] voice hear the voice listen to my voice
[1:37:10] God is rich in mercy to give so many
[1:37:12] warnings he does it because He loves us
[1:37:15] that's why I don't get tired of coming
[1:37:17] to church I always want that voice I
[1:37:19] always want to be sensitive to that
[1:37:20] voice of the Holy Spirit what Lord what
[1:37:23] would you like me to do sir what can I
[1:37:26] do to serve you better hold on I want to
[1:37:29] hear that voice look at Hosea this is
[1:37:31] beautiful wear this in our Bible time a
[1:37:32] few nights ago I don't even know I was
[1:37:34] gonna be so inspired to me Hosea 14 oh
[1:37:37] israel look he's saying return unto the
[1:37:40] Lord thy God come back you've fallen
[1:37:42] away come back look at the constant urge
[1:37:45] the Holy Spirit come back return for you
[1:37:49] phone away by your iniquity take with
[1:37:52] you words and turn to Lorna look he says
[1:37:54] you have to say the right thing to the

[1:38:00] got to say the right thing just like
[1:38:02] Hattie right had to say the right thing
[1:38:03] for the third pole so you got we've got
[1:38:05] to say the right thing to get right with
[1:38:06] God the Bible tells us what to say take
[1:38:10] these words into her Lord and say unto
[1:38:12] him say this to God say God take away

[1:38:30] you can say I'm sorry I'm wrong it was
[1:38:34] my fault it was all on the guilty one
[1:38:37] when you can say that it's like offering
[1:38:39] a sacrifice on the altar of God amen
[1:38:41] that's the calves of your lips that's
[1:38:44] the offering that's the sacrifice that
[1:38:46] God wants to see amen hallelujah when
[1:38:49] you can admit I was wrong it was my
[1:38:52] fault I should not have done that I
[1:38:54] sinned I transgress the Lord well you
[1:38:56] can say that say God have mercy on me

[1:40:40] to me return if there's anyone left
[1:40:42] return look at the faithful voice of the
[1:40:44] Holy Spirit right before Assyria comes
[1:40:47] in there and wipes him out he's saying
[1:40:48] sirrah won't save you they're not gonna
[1:40:51] be friends with you they're gonna
[1:40:52] destroy your life return to God and
[1:40:54] bring him the right sacrifice faithful
[1:40:57] God's constant faithful voice urging
[1:41:00] people do something about it take action
[1:41:04] change your life how many want lives
[1:41:06] that please the Lord we gotta take
[1:41:09] action if there's any place in our life
[1:41:11] where we're not taking action he's
[1:41:13] demanding action
[1:41:14] there's no sincerity there's no action
[1:41:17] all right brother Graham I'm always used
[1:41:21] this marriage so what if I said to my
[1:41:24] wife you know when we work or whatever I
[1:41:25] said I want to marry you but
[1:41:26] there's no action of buying an
[1:41:28] engagement ring there's no action of
[1:41:30] going to talk to her daddy there's no
[1:41:32] action of preparing a future home we got
[1:41:36] to have action behind our words if not
[1:41:40] the words just fall to the ground soon
[1:41:42] as we say follow the ground vain words
[1:41:44] there's no power in those words God was
[1:41:49] so faithful Joel Amos Hosea Isaiah Micah
[1:41:53] now here's Judah Judah kept going
[1:41:57] because you know Josiah was king of
[1:41:58] Judah Zedekiah was the last one the
[1:42:00] destruction of Jerusalem was in 607 BC
[1:42:03] that's what it was destroyed Judah was
[1:42:06] exiled Thole exile later and they
[1:42:10] received warnings from Zephaniah nahum
[1:42:12] habakkuk Obadiah and Jeremiah warning
[1:42:16] after warning after warning message
[1:42:22] after message after message it's more
[1:42:25] urgent now's the time to make a choice
[1:42:27] now's the time to follow the Lord now
[1:42:31] this story don't try to read this story
[1:42:33] it's written these words are really
[1:42:34] small but I liked it I saw it on a blog
[1:42:37] post this morning caution the moving
[1:42:40] walkways ending caution the moving
[1:42:42] walkway is ending if you've ever used an
[1:42:44] automated walkway to Airport you've
[1:42:46] heard this kind of announcement repeated
[1:42:47] has anybody ever tripped over one of
[1:42:49] those before
[1:42:49] I stumbled a little bit one time I
[1:42:52] wasn't looking up I wasn't quite ready
[1:42:53] you know in the airports the big
[1:42:54] airports like Chicago and different
[1:42:56] places when you go I forget what they're
[1:42:58] called now but you change what they
[1:43:00] called terminals yeah terminals
[1:43:02] sometimes they have those big long
[1:43:03] walkways and I just thought was so funny
[1:43:06] warning it's gonna end the walkway is
[1:43:08] gonna end the reason they do that is so
[1:43:12] is for your safety and protection and
[1:43:13] their liability they're not liable and
[1:43:16] God's not liable if he sends us warning
[1:43:18] after warning the blood will not be on
[1:43:21] the preachers hand the blood will not be
[1:43:22] upon God's hand it'll be on your hand be
[1:43:25] on my him we've got to take heed to what
[1:43:29] the Word of God is saying that's from
[1:43:32] the adults all the way down to the
[1:43:33] children the children have to listen to
[1:43:35] the voice of God and obey the voice of
[1:43:38] God and what
[1:43:40] this this uh this blog writer mentioned
[1:43:43] Galatians where Paul says if any man
[1:43:45] change the gospel they're a curse
[1:43:47] remember he said so I say it once so
[1:43:49] I'll say it again if any man change the
[1:43:51] gospel they're a curse remember that
[1:43:53] it's a warning again another warning
[1:43:56] another warning another warning I'm
[1:43:58] almost done and not only is this so but
[1:44:04] one must always remember that in the
[1:44:06] eyes of God time is very fleeting yeah a
[1:44:10] thousand years or but just a day and if
[1:44:14] he is coming within a few hours as he
[1:44:16] views time do you know that he's gonna
[1:44:18] be here in a few more hours Church we
[1:44:21] just gotta wait a little bit longer amen
[1:44:23] just a few more weary hours and then
[1:44:27] then he surely must warn us all
[1:44:30] I'm sure warned us with all agency
[1:44:33] there's gonna be so much agency
[1:44:34] preaching to the bride and foolish
[1:44:37] version and his voice must continually
[1:44:41] sound in our hearts to be ready against
[1:44:44] that coming
[1:44:44] you must continually hear that voice
[1:44:46] hear what he's saying hear what the
[1:44:48] preacher sang do what the preacher sang
[1:44:52] because it's the Word of God do it it's
[1:44:56] gonna be more constant it's gonna be
[1:44:58] more faithful it's gonna be more
[1:45:00] insistent if we do what he says the
[1:45:03] trouble is today there's so many voices
[1:45:04] in the world aren't there how many can
[1:45:07] say Amen there's so many voices out
[1:45:09] there and we don't some if we're not
[1:45:11] careful we don't even hear what the
[1:45:12] Spirit says the church there's so many
[1:45:15] voices in the world so many problems and
[1:45:17] needs crying for attention but there
[1:45:20] will never be a voice so important so
[1:45:22] worth attending as the voice of the
[1:45:23] Spirit he that hath him ear and ear let
[1:45:28] him hear what the spirit saith of the
[1:45:29] churches I use this in the future home
[1:45:32] number this so this was an Adam and Eve
[1:45:35] around the earth okay this is the flood
[1:45:38] of Noah's day this with Jesus Christ
[1:45:40] crucified here's the Millennium so we
[1:45:45] are right here Church if we could draw a
[1:45:46] line here we are right here and on the
[1:45:49] edge brother Brandon was a hair over
[1:45:53] right next to us this is God's view
[1:45:56] remember brother have said God let you
[1:45:57] have to look at it through God's view of
[1:45:59] time it's only been one two three four
[1:46:02] five six we're just finishing the sixth
[1:46:04] day we're just finishing it in God's
[1:46:07] time so I'm been going on for about a
[1:46:09] week right little over halfway through
[1:46:15] the week he cleanse it with the blood of
[1:46:16] Jesus at the beginning of the week he
[1:46:18] gave it a water baptism I need to see a
[1:46:21] baptism at the beginning I'm gonna
[1:46:23] sanctify it with the blood of my son and
[1:46:25] I'm gonna burn it with fire at the end
[1:46:27] of the week and we are right here so
[1:46:31] what we expect the voice of the Holy
[1:46:32] Spirit say just relax you're okay
[1:46:34] don't get me wrong don't get wrong the
[1:46:37] Holy Spirit says Shalom right we all
[1:46:39] heard that peace God wants you to have
[1:46:41] peace in your soul but the only way you
[1:46:44] have peace with God is to do what God
[1:46:45] says and that's listen to the voice of
[1:46:49] the Holy Spirit so this is God's
[1:46:52] viewpoint God looks he looks back at our
[1:46:53] our lives are just a real small hair
[1:46:55] right here real small hair and maybe
[1:46:59] this blue is you know coming over a
[1:47:00] little bit past the line there maybe but
[1:47:03] you understand we're right there God's
[1:47:05] view of time we're just finishing the
[1:47:07] sixth day let's stay on our feet here
[1:47:11] let's review this entire Philadelphia
[1:47:13] Church age in just about one or two
[1:47:14] minutes I hope this series has been a
[1:47:21] tremendous blessing to you my plan right
[1:47:23] now is to go into Laodicea and just
[1:47:25] review it a little bit because already
[1:47:28] preached five sermons on it I may go
[1:47:30] back but let's review this before we
[1:47:32] close the angel was John Wesley Jesus
[1:47:36] and his deity brother Branham said he
[1:47:37] was holy and true which means Jesus is
[1:47:39] the perfect realization of life bread
[1:47:42] water love everything he's the perfect
[1:47:45] realization of all these natural things
[1:47:47] comfort peace he is true he's the true
[1:47:50] bread he's the true light he's true
[1:47:52] forgiveness he's true peace he's true
[1:47:54] life he's everything the key of David is
[1:47:57] the key on the shoulder because Isaiah
[1:47:59] 22 verse 2 said the key was on his
[1:48:02] shoulder and the shoulder meant Jesus's
[1:48:04] responsibility first bride but RAM said
[1:48:06] also meant the key
[1:48:07] being a part of the millennium I didn't
[1:48:11] mean party it might be a rejoicing time
[1:48:13] it might be a holy party but surely
[1:48:16] ain't gonna be a worldly one the key
[1:48:18] being a part of the millennium since
[1:48:21] Jesus is the son of David yes have the
[1:48:23] key of David because the son of David
[1:48:25] takes us into the millennium to reign as
[1:48:28] son of David the no man openeth or
[1:48:32] shutteth brother Brahim clearly said
[1:48:33] every denomination claims that it opens
[1:48:35] the door that's not true Jesus and Jesus
[1:48:38] alone
[1:48:39] he sets the members in the body he
[1:48:41] endowed them with their ministries I so
[1:48:43] love that Jesus gave me this ministry I
[1:48:44] didn't go looking for it he gave it to
[1:48:46] me he puts the gifts at her disposal he
[1:48:50] cares for her and guides her she is his
[1:48:51] sole property and no one has and and he
