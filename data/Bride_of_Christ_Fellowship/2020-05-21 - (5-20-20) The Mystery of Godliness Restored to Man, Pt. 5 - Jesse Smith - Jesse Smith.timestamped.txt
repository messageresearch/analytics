[27:28] [Music]
[27:28] [Applause]
[27:31] [Music]
[27:40] [Music]
[27:53] let's face it already
[27:57] [Music]
[28:06] let's go to second Peter chapter one
[28:09] I'd like to continue on the stats for
[28:13] her man which is called the the mystery
[28:15] of godliness restored to man and then
[28:18] we'll read our memory verse from sister
[28:19] Caroline of Isaiah 12 the second Peter
[28:22] chapter 1 yeah
[28:32] second Peter chapter one Lord willing
[28:40] we'll look at faith as a foundation and
[28:44] then we'll begin a virtue tonight and
[28:46] we'll see how far we get
[28:48] by God's grace like to preach about an
[28:50] hour Lord willing I'm going to read
[29:01] myself I read verses three four and five
[29:06] that's really believed this is the way
[29:10] God builds Christian stature or maturity
[29:15] is through this path let's really
[29:17] believe that I truly believe this is a
[29:21] sanctification message you have to start
[29:23] with faith and then you get more little
[29:26] sanctify to get virtue he keeps saying
[29:28] defying you and he gives you all these
[29:30] virtues until you're capped off with
[29:32] charity after that you stay attached to
[29:35] the vine and pretty soon after that
[29:38] you'll produce real godly fruit as we
[29:40] looked at a little bit on Sunday night
[29:44] what if think about this what if all
[29:47] message churches preached it that way
[29:49] you have a lot more people that would
[29:51] see their need to be born again that's
[29:55] why I believe this is called a great
[29:56] mystery because a lot of even message
[29:58] searchers don't understand it but it's
[30:01] been revealed to us and so we want to
[30:03] take advantage of that say God add to my
[30:05] faith virtue add to my virtue knowledge
[30:08] to that my temperance and patience and
[30:11] godliness brotherly kindness add the
[30:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost to my
[30:16] brotherly kindness
[30:18] verse three according as his divine
[30:21] power hath given unto us all things that
[30:24] pertain unto life and godliness or
[30:26] whatever we need Church he's given to us
[30:28] by promise through the knowledge of him
[30:32] that have called us to glory and virtue
[30:37] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[30:39] great and precious promises that by the
[30:43] you might be partakers of the divine
[30:45] nature having escaped the corruption
[30:48] that is in the world through lust and
[30:51] beside this giving all diligence add to
[30:53] your faith virtue and to virtue
[30:56] knowledge let's go to Isaiah chapter 12
[31:00] verse 2 I will read verses 2 through 5
[31:30] out loved let's begin on three one two
[31:33] three
[31:34] behold god is my salvation i will trust
[31:38] and not be afraid for the lord jehovah
[31:42] is my strength and my son he also is
[31:47] become my salvation therefore the joy of
[31:54] salvation and in that day shall you say
[31:58] praise the lord call upon his name
[32:02] declare his doings among the people make
[32:06] mention that his name is exalted sing
[32:10] unto the Lord he have done excellent
[32:13] things this is known in all the earth
[32:16] let's have one more word of Prayer here
[32:18] as our head sir father will thank the
[32:21] Lord we love you Lord we raised our
[32:23] hearts and we're hands to heaven Lord we
[32:25] reach out and touch your Lord God by
[32:27] faith we love you Lord and father just
[32:30] minister to all the needs Lord God you
[32:32] know the sick need heal hearts need a
[32:35] strength and Lord God and Lord Souls
[32:38] needs save God's who use us Jesus use us
[32:41] and where we know that these promises
[32:44] are given to us and we just pray God we
[32:46] can receive your divine nature through
[32:48] the promises through believing and
[32:50] through patiently waiting until we
[32:52] receive father bless our our preaching
[32:55] tonight in our
[32:56] exception of God's Word will give you
[32:58] all the glory in Jesus Christ's name
[33:00] no reset amen amen god bless you as
[33:03] you're seated
[33:17] Lord willing I think we're on part five
[33:19] I believe tonight know the mystery of
[33:22] godliness restored a new man a new blade
[33:26] quite quite a good foundation on faith
[33:28] last week looking at justification by
[33:31] faith and then the gift of faith and
[33:33] saving faith last week and then more
[33:37] willing a Sunday night we looked at the
[33:38] fruit of faith so faith is quite an
[33:41] amazing subject it's mentioned over 220
[33:46] times in the New Testament it's it's
[33:50] quite a it's quite a topic because it's
[33:53] the very foundation and today we'll look
[33:55] at that as foundation we saw it here in
[34:00] 2nd Peter chapter 1 is the very first
[34:03] thing God gives you a member were saved
[34:06] by grace through faith so faith is a
[34:09] gift of God in other words it's a it's a
[34:12] measure of God's anointing that he gives
[34:15] you you have a little anointing of God's
[34:17] Spirit when you repent of your sins and
[34:20] you choose to follow Jesus Christ as the
[34:24] way praise God now we'll look at some
[34:28] scriptures here tonight
[34:29] I've got some Bible readers hopefully by
[34:32] God's grace let's start with vacation
[34:34] we'll start with the youngest and I
[34:35] usually start with the illness Keysha
[34:37] Luke 22:31 232 now this is a scripture
[34:46] to show that in in the middle of Peters
[34:51] deepest darkest trial
[34:55] and we could say failure right in the in
[34:59] Peters deepest failure what held him how
[35:03] come he didn't fall away like Judas what
[35:07] what hell Peter
[35:10] so we see from this scripture the answer
[35:14] is his foundation of faith so let's look
[35:21] at this and here we can see again the
[35:23] power of prayer we know you know God
[35:26] cannot go above free more agency so if
[35:30] someone wants to be lost they're going
[35:32] to be lost but if they want to be saved
[35:35] God will use other people to honor that
[35:39] that confidence and that faith that
[35:41] desire and God can force anyone to love
[35:46] him or receive faith so here we see
[35:48] Jesus is prayer working with Peters
[35:52] desire to be saved and so God honors
[35:55] Jesus's prayer so case you look 20 to 31
[35:59] and 32 yes please
[36:04] that you may eat and drink at my table
[36:07] in my kingdom and sit on Thrones judging
[36:10] the 12 tribes of Israel and the Lord
[36:13] said Simon Simon behold Satan has
[36:17] desired to have you that he may shift us
[36:20] eat but I pray for thee and thy faith
[36:24] fail not for thou art converted
[36:27] strengthen desire all right thank you
[36:33] okay so we see in the scripture right
[36:36] before Peters greatest failure as a
[36:39] believer as a Christian denying Christ
[36:42] three times to just the young maid Jesus
[36:46] said you know Satan wants to sift you
[36:49] like wheat
[36:51] okay now sift means to agitate that's
[36:53] they would take the the pitchforks and
[36:56] agitate the wheat grains right so Saint
[37:00] wanted to shake him up and remove him
[37:03] and then trample on him but Jesus said I
[37:08] prayed for you that your faith won't
[37:10] fail you won't fail you won't be
[37:12] agitated you won't be destroyed you
[37:14] won't be trodden asunder right you won't
[37:18] be
[37:19] you won't go to perdition
[37:22] he said I prayed for you that your faith
[37:24] won't fail this is quite a statement and
[37:28] also quite understanding so do you
[37:31] realize children that you could deny
[37:33] Christ three times and still your faith
[37:35] in a failure it would look like you did
[37:39] fail right it would look like you failed
[37:43] but you didn't you didn't fail which
[37:47] means you didn't throw away your faith
[37:50] right because we know Peter felt bad
[37:53] about his mistake right but that doesn't
[37:55] mean he was going to be lost that
[37:57] doesn't mean he lost his faith totally
[37:59] it just means he got a spirit of fear
[38:02] upon him and doesn't mean he lost his
[38:06] faith okay so I want you to keep that in
[38:08] mind too if you ever make a mistake you
[38:12] ever fail and you feel really bad about
[38:15] it it's good that you feel bad about it
[38:17] because your dad has made mistakes and I
[38:19] felt ashamed of myself before but that
[38:21] doesn't mean you're not saved right so
[38:25] we must keep that in mind this is why
[38:28] this is why Peter such a great example
[38:29] for us in the scripture we can learn so
[38:33] much from him and remember he's the one
[38:35] Jesus gave the keys to the game he
[38:37] already had the keys of the kingdom
[38:39] right but he wasn't really using them
[38:41] yet because it didn't get the Holy Ghost
[38:43] once I got the Holy Ghost that he can go
[38:45] use them on the day of Pentecost 3,000
[38:47] people got saved Cornelius his house
[38:49] they got the Holy Ghost and then Samaria
[38:53] he prayed for them to get the Holy Ghost
[38:54] after Philip did an evangelistic work
[38:57] there so it was Jesus's prayer that kept
[39:01] Peters faith foundation from falling
[39:04] even though he denied in three times
[39:06] see Peter didn't commit suicide like
[39:08] Judas right
[39:10] he didn't take money to sell Jesus out
[39:13] on purpose like Judas did he felt bad
[39:18] about it
[39:19] he didn't leave God's presence like
[39:21] Canaan Cain left he purposely left the
[39:24] Friends of God
[39:25] well Peter left cuz he was ashamed but
[39:28] he wanted to come back right but Cain
[39:31] just left it would humble himself
[39:35] so in other words Peter hung around
[39:38] until he could experience Christ's
[39:40] forgiveness that's what you want to do
[39:42] you want to hang around church you want
[39:44] to hang around church even if you failed
[39:47] until you feel Christ
[39:50] drawing you to repent and then you'll
[39:52] feel forgiven when you genuinely repent
[39:54] that's right because remember Peter knew
[39:57] this in John 6 68 he said Lord to whom
[40:00] shall we go thou has the words to
[40:02] eternal life for he's God he didn't go
[40:05] off to the the Pharisees and Sadducees
[40:07] and the Sanhedrin and try to make some
[40:09] money off of Jesus he went and hid it
[40:12] right and cried and wept bitterly and
[40:14] felt ashamed of himself until he heard
[40:17] Jesus was resurrected and then until
[40:20] Jesus himself appeared to Peter to prove
[40:22] that he'd been resurrected
[40:27] alright now be encouraged search you
[40:31] know you might say well Jesus prayed for
[40:33] Peter or what about me he didn't pray
[40:35] for you he prayed for me praise God and
[40:38] that's why my faith is standing today
[40:40] amen so Lydia why don't you read John
[40:43] that's what John 17 20 and 21
[40:49] the Malka if you can go to Matthew 7 24
[40:55] 25 so Lydia's gonna read a scripture
[41:00] about how Jesus prayed for his disciples
[41:04] and for us and so as long as church as
[41:09] long as we have a desire to be saved and
[41:12] not be lost God will make a way that we
[41:15] can be saved amen so go ahead they all
[41:24] may be one as a father or indeed they
[41:27] also may be one a praise God
[41:34] so jesus prayed for all the all his
[41:37] disciples and all those who would hear
[41:40] on him through their word praise God and
[41:43] that's we read the Bible where steer was
[41:46] that we're still hearing on Jesus
[41:48] through
[41:48] their words through their testimonies
[41:50] praise God
[41:54] so we thank you Lord Jesus for your
[41:56] prayers that's perfect because he's the
[41:58] high priest amen
[41:59] he's a priest so see st. since our faith
[42:03] is motivated by love our faith
[42:07] foundation is the rock on which God
[42:10] builds our spiritual house the faith is
[42:12] the rock the foundation now it's
[42:14] interesting Peter had the foundation but
[42:17] his house got blown down but he never
[42:20] lost his foundation so Malachi is gonna
[42:26] read Matthew 4 or 7 24 and 25 which is
[42:30] right after Jesus talks about false
[42:32] prophets how they could do supernatural
[42:36] things the anointed ones at the end time
[42:38] and Jesus will say I never knew you and
[42:42] it's because they forfeited the
[42:45] foundation of real genuine
[42:48] faith so now I can read that there's
[42:52] there's there for whosoever heareth
[42:54] these sayings of mine and doeth them I
[42:56] will like you to him unto a wise man
[42:58] which goes house upon a rock and the
[43:01] rain descended and the floods came and
[43:02] the winds blew and beat upon that house
[43:04] and it fell not first founded upon the
[43:07] rock amen
[43:08] now we have to understand this children
[43:11] that Judas at one time had the
[43:13] foundation the Bible said the word is
[43:16] like a seed right and it fell into his
[43:18] heart but it fell upon stony grounds
[43:22] right it didn't have the right the right
[43:25] type of ground another illustration is
[43:28] like the other kind of ground jesus said
[43:31] where the seed falls right in the ground
[43:34] but then a bird comes by and snatches
[43:38] that word away Judas did miracles he was
[43:43] baptized he baptized others he was
[43:47] sanctified to some degree at some point
[43:49] but then at another point he forsook it
[43:54] he sold it out he transgressed or he
[43:57] transgressed God's covenant and God's
[43:59] Word and
[44:01] or Sukkot and got rid of it he he
[44:05] rejected God's anointing and then he
[44:07] took the anointing of Satan himself as
[44:10] the son of perdition and so this is what
[44:14] Jesus says faith is our rock foundation
[44:17] thank God amen
[44:19] that if we build if we genuinely build
[44:22] our relationship with Jesus Christ upon
[44:25] his own faith when the storms come
[44:27] Church our testimonies not going to fall
[44:30] amen
[44:31] our testimony is going to stand when the
[44:34] trials of life when coronavirus comes
[44:37] through right when when financial
[44:39] trouble comes through when family
[44:42] trouble comes through our tent we're not
[44:44] going to lose our testimony and one of
[44:46] our say Christianity will keep our
[44:49] testimony our testimony will stand in
[44:51] the midst of our trials so si has an
[44:55] overcomer we receive faith we reject
[45:01] unbelief because remember those are the
[45:02] two choices at this point you have
[45:05] either faith or unbelief you reject
[45:07] unbelief you accept faith and God gives
[45:10] you that faith anointing and gives you
[45:12] that you have that foundation laid in
[45:15] your soul and then once you have that
[45:19] foundation God wants to start building
[45:21] the structure don't see that you want to
[45:23] start building virtue praise God so
[45:24] let's start looking at virtue virtue is
[45:27] the second measure or portion the Holy
[45:33] Ghost anointing is number of faith is a
[45:34] portion according to Romans 12 everybody
[45:37] has a measure of faith that's a portion
[45:41] a substance of faith so then God wants
[45:44] to add virtue to you all right so we're
[45:50] going to read some scriptures here let's
[45:53] get a case you're ready here so you go
[46:00] to Matthew 23 25 acacia alright so the
[46:05] second thing after you choose faith now
[46:08] remember faith is choosing the way
[46:10] because jesus said the way the truth the
[46:13] life way is justification
[46:15] the truth sanctify them through thy
[46:17] truth thy Word is truth so the truth is
[46:21] the sanctification stage and then the
[46:24] life is the baptism with Holy Ghost
[46:26] that's a great revelation and I got last
[46:28] week while preaching this Haman but
[46:33] virtue is this first step of the truth
[46:36] receiving the truth now in the New
[46:39] Testament virtue is a strong course of
[46:45] action its moral excellence
[46:49] now Hebrew it means strength or might so
[46:55] when you combine these two definitions
[46:57] of virtue you see that virtue is the
[47:01] strength to daily walk in God's Way now
[47:06] this makes sense logically to after you
[47:09] have faith faith chooses the right way
[47:12] then you need strength to empower you to
[47:15] walk in the right way right so faith is
[47:19] like you going for a walk
[47:20] faith is you choose the right path now
[47:23] virtue is what you need to walk that
[47:25] path and so virtue is the second obvious
[47:31] character trait the second measure of
[47:34] anointing God gives to the believer now
[47:37] to receive this you've got to reject
[47:40] hypocrisy because hypocrisy is the in
[47:45] the Greek means that acting of a stage
[47:47] player like we don't want to act like or
[47:50] enjoy in church we want to we wouldn't
[47:52] enjoy it praise God we don't want to act
[47:54] like we enjoy listening to the tapes we
[47:56] don't want to act like we enjoy singing
[47:58] or enjoy them we don't want to act like
[48:00] we enjoy the preaching we want to be
[48:01] real praise God and that's what you get
[48:04] when you get virtue you genuinely have
[48:06] that strength to live a Christian life
[48:12] because of a modern definition of
[48:14] hypocrisy is claiming to have beliefs or
[48:18] standards but your behavior does not
[48:21] conform to it so we don't want to be
[48:25] hypocrites right I was saying like this
[48:28] Pharisees as a case you're going to be
[48:30] the scripture of course the Pharisees
[48:32] were the kings of hypocrisy so in case
[48:35] you read Matthew 23 25 well to you
[48:42] scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye
[48:45] make clean the outside of the cup and of
[48:49] the platter but within they are full of
[48:52] extortion and excess no he's showing
[48:56] censure there can you read verse 28 as
[48:58] well even so ye also outwardly appear
[49:04] righteous unto men but with their knee
[49:06] are full of hypocrisy and iniquity very
[49:10] good okay a perfect example of people
[49:14] that reject virtue because they reject
[49:19] God's anointing on virtue they go to the
[49:22] side of hypocrisy Jesus says you look
[49:25] beautiful
[49:26] your clothes are modest right your hairs
[49:30] long for you brothers your hair short
[49:33] trimmed up but inwardly he said you're
[49:37] full of extortion you're trying to get
[49:40] money the wrong way excess and then
[49:43] hypocrisy you're a stage player not even
[49:46] living and we know they weren't even
[49:49] living Moses's law they had their own
[49:51] books called the Mishnah which was the
[49:54] traditional interpretation of Moses's
[49:56] law that other rabbis had written before
[49:59] them in other words they were living the
[50:01] traditions of men rather than the
[50:04] commandments of God and the one example
[50:06] Jesus gave was many of the Pharisees the
[50:11] sin of taking care of their parents in
[50:13] their own age and spending that money on
[50:16] them they would give the money to the
[50:17] temple and of course that would go back
[50:20] to them you know it would fund their
[50:23] their programs their desires very
[50:26] selfish and Jesus said because of your
[50:29] tradition
[50:30] you made the commandments of God of none
[50:32] effect and so elderly parents weren't
[50:36] getting cared for they weren't getting
[50:37] fed they were getting taken care of
[50:40] and so people were being hurt because of
[50:43] their hypocrisy but yeah out really they
[50:46] looked they looked the part they went to
[50:48] church every Saturday right we go every
[50:51] Sunday we cannot let an Apocrypha rule
[50:56] our lives especially as message
[50:57] believers we got to be sincere we have
[51:00] to have virtue strength to live what we
[51:03] say we believe and that's real virtue
[51:10] now the first place we're really going
[51:13] to see our virtue is in our home so
[51:15] Lidia Malka can you turn to Matthew
[51:19] 10:32 listen a whole bunch of scriptures
[51:28] with Matthew 10:32 242 but we're not
[51:35] going to read on that then can you read
[51:41] 32 and 33 therefore confess me before
[51:46] men so ever shut the night before men
[51:52] him raise gods jesus says you have to
[51:58] confess Christ before other people now
[52:03] remember this a few months ago I
[52:04] preached on this this was a real
[52:05] blessing to Peter denied Christ three
[52:08] times before men right but then he said
[52:12] he's sorry he said he was sorry and then
[52:15] after that he got the Holy Ghost he
[52:16] never denied Christ again okay you have
[52:20] to make sure we're patient and we
[52:23] understand God will forgive us if we
[52:24] make a mistake God will forgive us
[52:27] now back I would like you to read here
[52:31] 34 and 35 think not that I am come to
[52:36] send peace on earth I came not to send
[52:38] peace but a sword
[52:39] Brian come to set a man at variance
[52:41] against his father and the daughter
[52:42] against her mother and the daughter in
[52:44] law against her mother-in-law
[52:45] great verse 36 and a man's foes shall be
[52:48] they of his own household let me say
[52:51] like this for our children your siblings
[52:54] will
[52:54] your foes until you really love Jesus
[52:57] right if you really love Jesus
[53:02] he says you won't deny him in in your
[53:05] household you'll have peace in your
[53:07] household in other words right so that's
[53:11] what we really need we need the Holy
[53:13] Spirit to give us faith and virtue to
[53:17] love our siblings amen and not deny
[53:22] Christ in our homes it's so critical so
[53:25] important verse 37 he that loveth father
[53:28] mother more than me is not worthy of me
[53:30] he that loveth son or daughter more than
[53:32] me is not worthy of me to see we no
[53:36] matter what people in our household say
[53:38] we have to believe God's Word and obey
[53:41] God's Word so a good example might be if
[53:44] some of your household is saying evil
[53:47] words or cursing or watching bad shows
[53:49] we must not join them
[53:52] we must not partake in that because when
[53:54] you partake in that then you'll be a
[53:56] partaker of the consequences of that
[53:58] that's what the mystery Mystery Babylon
[54:02] is all about that's why the daughters
[54:04] are will be guilty just as the mother
[54:07] the denominations of Protestants will be
[54:09] just as guilty as the Roman Catholic
[54:11] because they're not standing up against
[54:13] it they must stand against all forms of
[54:17] evil avoid all appearance of evil praise
[54:20] God so that's an important scripture us
[54:29] Hebert you if you can live your faith
[54:32] out in your family with virtue in your
[54:35] home then Jesus says you'll live it out
[54:37] with others because he said you you
[54:40] you're probably going to get a lot of
[54:41] Opposition in your home that's what he
[54:44] says so his requirement is public and
[54:50] private confession of Jesus Christ so he
[54:53] gives us the anointing to do it for his
[54:56] god amen since Jesus requires us to
[54:59] confess our him before our family and
[55:02] friends he gives us the virtue to do it
[55:04] praise God amen
[55:06] beautiful
[55:08] beautiful scriptures praise God now
[55:10] let's look at a few scriptures here
[55:14] Casey can you get Deuteronomy 25 five
[55:20] and Lenny can you go there as well well
[55:22] I'll read five verses Deuteronomy 25
[55:25] five to ten they have case you read to
[55:27] them whether you can the last three okay
[55:30] so I want to go to two examples virtue
[55:34] from the Old Testament so the first two
[55:39] people I thought about were Ruth and
[55:41] Daniel okay now Ruth is just a beautiful
[55:45] example because the Bible says she
[55:48] specifically had virtue it's just a
[55:51] perfect example that's why I love the
[55:53] message brother Adam showed us if you
[55:55] just run a concordance or the Bible you
[55:57] will find in the revelations that you're
[55:59] looking for because God used those same
[56:02] words over and over and over to give the
[56:04] same revelations
[56:06] okay so Ruth is a great example of
[56:10] virtue Boaz was the wealthy Bethlehem
[56:13] ight Lord of the harvest he was a
[56:16] kinsman to Mount melon Ruth's first
[56:20] husband who died without any children to
[56:23] carry on his name well God was so
[56:26] gracious God didn't want Malins name to
[56:30] die so God had a law that if a man dies
[56:35] and he doesn't have children to carry
[56:37] out his name sons then that then the
[56:41] brother of the man who died has to marry
[56:43] his wife and give her children so her
[56:48] first husband's name the husband that
[56:50] died his name can continue on so let's
[56:55] read that so it's a Deuteronomy 25 five
[56:59] to ten so case you read five and six and
[57:02] then Lydia can be seven eight nine oh
[57:05] three five six and seven
[57:08] then you're eight nine ten okay okay so
[57:10] when you're ready brethren drive
[57:14] together and one of them died and have
[57:16] no child the wife of the dead shall not
[57:19] marry
[57:20] without - unto a stranger
[57:23] her husband's weather shall go in unto
[57:27] her and take her to Hamlet to White and
[57:30] perform the duty of a husband's brothers
[57:34] unto her and it shows me that the first
[57:37] chord which she bares shall succeed it
[57:41] and the good name of his brother which
[57:45] is that that his name is not put out of
[57:49] Israel and if the man alike not to take
[57:54] his brother his wife then let his
[57:56] brother's wife cuddle up the gate unto
[57:59] the elders and say my husband's brother
[58:02] refuses to raise up unto him unto his
[58:08] brother
[58:08] ARIMA in Israel he will not perform the
[58:11] judea of my husband's brother then the
[58:15] elders of his city shall call him and
[58:17] speak unto him and if he stand - inside
[58:19] life not to take her then shot his
[58:21] brother's wife commanded him in the
[58:22] presence of the elders and loosed his
[58:24] shoe from off his foot and spin his face
[58:26] and shall answer and say show so shall
[58:29] it be done unto that man that will not
[58:32] build up his brother's house and his
[58:33] name shall be called is there the house
[58:35] of him that has his shoes amen
[58:38] so now that's a great background and
[58:41] this is the scripture children that Ruth
[58:44] was believing that was Ruth the Jew
[58:47] she's ammo byte but she was a proselyte
[58:50] right she had a choice you either stay
[58:52] in Moab or come back with Naomi and
[58:54] because she respected Naomi's God she
[58:57] said your God is gonna be my god right
[59:00] your life where you die I'm gonna die
[59:02] where you live I'm gonna live because
[59:04] she saw such godliness and they owned
[59:06] his life
[59:07] praise God and so she comes here and and
[59:10] she must have asked Naomi well what's
[59:13] the law I would like to be married and
[59:15] so Naomi must have directed her back to
[59:18] this and you know what she did but let's
[59:22] just talk about it you know she went out
[59:24] to the field Naomi direct her which
[59:26] field to go to you know her family and
[59:28] she gleaned a little bit and everybody
[59:30] started seeing wow what a god she's a
[59:32] nice young
[59:33] beautiful woman and she's just willing
[59:36] to work and pretty soon there's a nice
[59:39] reputation about Ruth
[59:41] that's what we all want a good
[59:43] reputation we're hard workers we keep
[59:45] the Word of God we don't play around
[59:47] we're not foolish with people right they
[59:50] don't break laws and things like that we
[59:52] live a godly life and so in the Ruth 311
[59:58] Boaz says the confidence that he has he
[1:00:02] said I will do to thee for all the city
[1:00:07] of my people death know that thou art a
[1:00:10] virtuous woman he imagined it
[1:00:11] she lived such a godly life everybody in
[1:00:14] the town knew she was a good person
[1:00:17] because of her virtue now you remember
[1:00:21] what she did one night while one night
[1:00:25] while Boaz was sleeping he he had a
[1:00:28] little I think a little bit to drink if
[1:00:30] I'm not mistaken I could be wrong on
[1:00:32] that but he laid down on this this this
[1:00:34] paje and Ruth Ruth knew the Word of God
[1:00:39] she knew she had a godly testimony as
[1:00:42] she thought if he's a gun if he's if
[1:00:44] that man's worth anything she said no no
[1:00:47] doubt he was a good man she did that too
[1:00:49] but she knew if he's a believer all's
[1:00:51] I've got to do is I've just got to go
[1:00:53] present myself there and say that my
[1:00:56] husband died and you can raise me it you
[1:00:59] can raise up a seed through me in other
[1:01:02] words I want you to keep God's Word I
[1:01:05] want you to keep God's Word so she
[1:01:08] initiated it maybe he wasn't open maybe
[1:01:11] he was unaware of it but that that's why
[1:01:14] Ruth is such a godly example she wanted
[1:01:16] the people and the men to honor God's
[1:01:18] Word she wanted to bring forth children
[1:01:22] right which we know is Obed she wanted
[1:01:25] so she initiated is a husband she said
[1:01:28] can you be my husband because God's Word
[1:01:30] says you shouldn't be my husband praise
[1:01:32] God and so of course he says yes I'll do
[1:01:36] this of course this is this is right
[1:01:38] this is scriptural everybody knows
[1:01:41] you're a virtuous woman
[1:01:42] remember beau has children beau has
[1:01:45] pointed out that she could have ran
[1:01:47] she's a mobile bite she could ran off
[1:01:50] and buried any rich young man she was
[1:01:53] tempted to do that she could ran off and
[1:01:55] married somebody quick so she'd have to
[1:01:57] go work in that hot Sun but she chose to
[1:02:00] honor God's Word and because of that God
[1:02:04] honored her and put her name and lineage
[1:02:08] in the lineage of Jesus Christ praise
[1:02:12] God a Moabite he didn't even belong in
[1:02:14] it no connection to Jesus Christ but
[1:02:17] because she honored Naomi and then one
[1:02:22] bow has to honor God's Word and
[1:02:25] initiated God's Word God put her in the
[1:02:28] very lineage of Jesus Christ and turned
[1:02:30] that shows how God God brought a Gentile
[1:02:33] into the faith that showed how God was
[1:02:36] gonna bring the Gentiles into the holy
[1:02:39] tree in other words the church ages
[1:02:41] please God since the Judas turned him
[1:02:44] down he said I'll get a Gentile that's
[1:02:47] what God was showing God was showing I
[1:02:48] can bring a Gentile into this lineage I
[1:02:52] can do it by grace amen so just a
[1:02:58] beautiful beautiful story so see this
[1:03:02] proves you and I can live out our faith
[1:03:04] at all times and our virtue in all
[1:03:07] public settings if she can do it in a
[1:03:10] hot Blazing Sun a bunch of men that were
[1:03:13] rich and you know watching her and
[1:03:15] everything like that then we can do it
[1:03:16] right we can do it because where most of
[1:03:20] us aren't working that hard right with
[1:03:22] also us at work you're gonna mow soon
[1:03:24] I'm gonna go work out in the fields
[1:03:25] you're gonna work in an air-conditioned
[1:03:27] office or school probably right your
[1:03:30] life's gonna be so easy so she can do it
[1:03:32] in the hot Sun all of you can do it in
[1:03:34] the cool air conditioning you can do it
[1:03:39] because it's the same Holy Spirit praise
[1:03:42] God
[1:03:43] and your dad does it every day when I
[1:03:45] used to go to school I live the godly
[1:03:48] life in front of everybody everybody
[1:03:50] knows there I'm a Christian praise God
[1:03:58] all right so Ruth is a great testimony
[1:04:02] obey God's Word publicly despite
[1:04:05] financial and sensual temptations maybe
[1:04:07] Boaz wasn't the nicest looking guy there
[1:04:11] was younger men that she could've ran
[1:04:12] off with maybe he was an older looking
[1:04:14] guy maybe wasn't so handsome we don't
[1:04:16] know when she was tempted by young men
[1:04:19] by riches easy life she easily could
[1:04:23] have left Naomi but she stayed true to
[1:04:26] Naomi just like the bride stays true to
[1:04:28] the old testament word - right we see
[1:04:31] principles in their honor thy mother and
[1:04:33] father thou shalt not steal kill we keep
[1:04:35] those commands praise God now let's look
[1:04:40] at another one - I forgot I had another
[1:04:41] one about 20 minutes here by God's grace
[1:04:47] Solomon gives us another example of
[1:04:49] virtue in proverbs 31 which is fitting
[1:04:53] that we just passed mother's day two
[1:04:55] Sundays ago I'll just go over this
[1:04:58] briefly but Solomon says a virtuous
[1:05:00] woman possesses the fear of the Lord and
[1:05:04] to fear the Lord if she has that she
[1:05:07] shall be praised
[1:05:09] now remember wisdom is the result of
[1:05:13] having fear so if you fear God first you
[1:05:15] respect God you don't want to break his
[1:05:17] word you want to love him and obey Him
[1:05:19] you don't want to go to hell right your
[1:05:21] respect his his power the strength if
[1:05:25] you have that God is going to give you
[1:05:27] wisdom because Solomon says the fear of
[1:05:31] the Lord is the beginning of wisdom so
[1:05:34] virtuous woman there in Solomon's
[1:05:37] writing shall fear God and then she
[1:05:40] makes wise decisions remember she made
[1:05:43] wise decisions and motherhood her
[1:05:46] personal finances and her business deals
[1:05:48] and so will you write and you're late
[1:05:51] you'll make a wise decision when you
[1:05:53] marry that woman
[1:05:54] you'll make a wise decision if a man
[1:05:57] tries to court you you'll make wise men
[1:06:01] not a foolish decision you'll make a
[1:06:02] wise decision with your money you're not
[1:06:05] going to go blow your money on anything
[1:06:07] right you're going to use it wisely and
[1:06:10] best
[1:06:11] steals before you invest in a car before
[1:06:15] you invest in start your own business
[1:06:17] you make sure it's a good business
[1:06:19] you're gonna use wisdom other words what
[1:06:22] God approve of me doing this so to give
[1:06:24] you an example
[1:06:25] we've got approve of a of me going to
[1:06:28] work at a salon where you cut women's
[1:06:31] hair is that a good business to start no
[1:06:34] not with wisdom how about for America
[1:06:38] we'll make a video game where we're
[1:06:40] killing people all the time how about
[1:06:41] that would that be a good thing
[1:06:43] vampires and zombies and video game
[1:06:47] about drugs will make a movie about
[1:06:49] drugs and all the benefits of that have
[1:06:52] all kinds of evil things course not
[1:06:54] you wouldn't put your money into a
[1:06:56] business deal and something that was
[1:06:58] evil and sinful because you fear God you
[1:07:01] don't care if it's gonna be popular or
[1:07:02] not with people you want to do what
[1:07:04] God's calling you to do because if God
[1:07:06] because if you under God if you book God
[1:07:08] first he'll give you everything you need
[1:07:09] praise God amen seek you first and
[1:07:11] everything else and if you put the
[1:07:13] spiritual things first everything in the
[1:07:15] natural be added to you praise God I'm a
[1:07:17] witness of that hallelujah so see a
[1:07:21] virtuous woman is trustworthy her heart
[1:07:24] of her husband does safely trust in her
[1:07:27] so when you have virtue children I'll be
[1:07:31] able to trust you out in public which I
[1:07:34] did especially with your friends right
[1:07:37] around your friends that's when you know
[1:07:39] you got virtue Summa no hate no one time
[1:07:41] Haman asks about the stage for men you
[1:07:44] know you got murked you when I can trust
[1:07:46] you to honor God's Word around your
[1:07:49] friends that aren't obeying God's Word
[1:07:51] that's a good that's a good measurement
[1:07:54] that you know you got burnt you how
[1:07:57] they're doing them and this kind of
[1:08:03] person is number she's clothed with
[1:08:06] strength and honor that's her clothing
[1:08:08] so the same thing that's virtue right
[1:08:10] strength is virtue so when you're a
[1:08:12] virtuous young man or virtuous young
[1:08:14] ladies your clothing is your spiritual
[1:08:17] strength your virtue your clothes with
[1:08:20] that you wear that people can see you're
[1:08:22] not going to laugh at the dirty jokes
[1:08:23] you're not going to
[1:08:24] all people names not going to treat
[1:08:27] people in an evil way you're gonna be a
[1:08:29] solid sound Christian that a strength
[1:08:32] you're not gonna deny the word you're
[1:08:35] gonna deny the word and and do evil
[1:08:37] things you're gonna keep the word no
[1:08:39] matter who's around I'm sure you you
[1:08:45] guys Mara went to that funeral and
[1:08:49] Sheffield a few months ago and sister so
[1:08:53] there that that's a good place where you
[1:08:55] can see what kind of virtue you have
[1:08:59] like if I think a good example is
[1:09:01] Malachi some of the older guys we're
[1:09:03] trying to do a game the wrong way but
[1:09:05] you got to stand up for the game the
[1:09:07] right way right so when you stand up for
[1:09:10] good that's a good sign you've got to
[1:09:13] merge you when you're standing up for
[1:09:15] others getting teased you're trying to
[1:09:18] stand up for them that's a good sign you
[1:09:19] got virtue because you're doing it
[1:09:21] publicly and people can see that you're
[1:09:24] not a pushover you're not a pretender
[1:09:26] right you're not a you're not a
[1:09:27] hypocrite you're not a Pharisee they
[1:09:30] just pretend to be holy but they're
[1:09:31] really not they don't really live what
[1:09:34] they believe as that's what we have to
[1:09:36] do as well
[1:09:38] so I hope that helps the children Haven
[1:09:40] is that cup a little bit so everybody
[1:09:45] new in the town everybody new in the
[1:09:47] message church right everybody knew that
[1:09:48] around the message that this person was
[1:09:49] a real solid Christian and just like
[1:09:53] Ruth this virtuous woman is so valuable
[1:09:56] her price is far above rubies praise God
[1:09:59] when you've got virtue you're worth
[1:10:02] millions praise God you're worth more
[1:10:04] than millions you can't you can't put a
[1:10:08] value on that because children you don't
[1:10:10] know our children you don't know the
[1:10:12] pain of divorce I do because I my
[1:10:16] parents were divorced I would give any
[1:10:19] money to have my parents in love back
[1:10:23] together is it the price is invaluable
[1:10:26] and a virtuous life is far valuable more
[1:10:31] valuable than riches and millions of
[1:10:32] dollars I'd give anything if I could go
[1:10:35] back and my parents always took me to
[1:10:37] the messenger
[1:10:38] action and taught me the things of God
[1:10:40] is so valuable I give all of the money I
[1:10:42] have from the bank right now for that
[1:10:43] easy I can go back I can be raising the
[1:10:47] spiritual things of God it's it's a it's
[1:10:52] a value ride enough to live through you
[1:10:54] know having no dad there but in our dad
[1:10:57] there to be with me dad didn't come to
[1:11:00] my games you know I didn't I didn't have
[1:11:02] that it's it's so valuable so you can't
[1:11:09] put a value on it and that's why the
[1:11:11] Bible says a good Christian character
[1:11:14] it's more for value than anything
[1:11:17] someone who's got strength and virtue to
[1:11:20] live God's Word okay the last example is
[1:11:24] Daniel Daniel was so virtuous he was so
[1:11:29] dedicated his co-workers in public they
[1:11:33] watched him on the job they couldn't
[1:11:34] find one thing wrong that he couldn't he
[1:11:37] didn't break one rule I'll tell you
[1:11:38] that's virtue right there I'm sure at my
[1:11:41] job sometimes ever now then I might for
[1:11:43] I might forget something I don't do
[1:11:45] something right but Daniel they couldn't
[1:11:48] find one thing on him so they had to
[1:11:53] concoct
[1:11:54] a devious plan to make a law where they
[1:11:59] know he would break it because it dealt
[1:12:01] with his faith as a religion and so they
[1:12:04] did this in Daniel chapter six you know
[1:12:06] the story so he had a choice do I
[1:12:09] publicly under God or not do I keep
[1:12:13] praying or but do I reject my public
[1:12:18] testimony what he choose
[1:12:20] he chose virtue he chose I'll still open
[1:12:25] my window I'll still get on my knees and
[1:12:27] pray to god I'll face towards Jerusalem
[1:12:29] and I was pray to my god I guess he had
[1:12:32] public strength to obey God's Word
[1:12:35] that's real virtue
[1:12:37] she kept his three prayers a day we know
[1:12:40] he got arrested he got sentenced he's
[1:12:42] thrown into the dead but God sent His
[1:12:45] Holy Angel there to shut the lion's
[1:12:48] mouth and he was delivered this is the
[1:12:51] power
[1:12:52] divine virtue public strength to do
[1:12:55] what's right even when you know you're
[1:12:58] gonna suffer so now we have women
[1:13:01] examples and I gave you a boy example
[1:13:04] there as well a virtue or you can live
[1:13:06] it publicly praise God no matter what
[1:13:12] people say they can say whatever they
[1:13:14] want no matter they can even lay lay
[1:13:17] temptations in front of you but you will
[1:13:20] choose to do what's right each time
[1:13:27] alright so let's go we have 15 minutes
[1:13:29] let's do a couple more let's look at
[1:13:36] some examples Jesus gives of how we can
[1:13:38] mean virtuous and some of these will
[1:13:40] apply to us
[1:13:42] so let's go education today was I was
[1:13:51] going to Matthew 5 38 to 42 is she
[1:13:56] millionaire - Lydia Matthew 6
[1:14:02] so Jesus Christ gives concrete examples
[1:14:06] how to manifest virtue in public and
[1:14:10] private settings and this is the
[1:14:19] beautiful part virtue is an anointing
[1:14:24] but you got to have that anointing
[1:14:25] before you go out in public if not you
[1:14:28] won't have that virtue that strength to
[1:14:30] give out ok so in other words we got to
[1:14:35] be ready when someone asks us to do
[1:14:37] something got to be ready to do it if we
[1:14:39] possibly can so Matthew 5 38 Meraki he
[1:14:47] read 38 39 to 40 you have heard that has
[1:14:54] been said an eye for an eye and tooth
[1:14:56] for a tooth but I stand he that ye
[1:14:59] resist not evil though whatsoever shall
[1:15:01] smite thee on thy right cheek turn to
[1:15:03] him the other also and if any man will
[1:15:05] see
[1:15:05] the Lord sing away thy coat let him have
[1:15:07] thy cloak also all right
[1:15:11] so here we're to see four examples of
[1:15:14] here are some obvious ways that you can
[1:15:17] show you have virtue somebody hit you
[1:15:21] you don't hit a magnet so for us
[1:15:24] somebody pushes you somebody punches you
[1:15:26] you don't budge you back case you 4142
[1:15:37] to go mile go with him Twain give it to
[1:15:42] you him that asketh thee give that
[1:15:45] Barrio of me
[1:15:47] turn turn that that way praise God
[1:15:52] these are beautiful examples of having
[1:15:55] virtue you can give out right but
[1:15:57] eventually you got that virtue before
[1:15:59] you can give it out you have to have
[1:16:00] strength before you can strengthen
[1:16:02] others okay so these are four great
[1:16:05] examples you have to have this strength
[1:16:07] if somebody hits you you don't hit them
[1:16:08] back if you get sued and somebody wants
[1:16:11] something give them something else if
[1:16:15] somebody wants you to go an extra mile
[1:16:16] you have strength to go the extra mile
[1:16:19] if somebody asks you for something you
[1:16:22] got to be able to give it to them all
[1:16:26] right now Matthew 6 is more about
[1:16:29] private virtue
[1:16:36] that's okay you've heard of motorcycle
[1:16:39] programs tapes you hear people honking
[1:16:42] all the time because they're their
[1:16:43] church was at the corner of an
[1:16:44] intersection you've never seen so
[1:16:47] Matthew six Jesus gives us some more
[1:16:49] examples of having virtue 6 verses 1 to
[1:16:53] 4 you read 1 to 4 is he that you do not
[1:16:59] your alms before men to be seen of them
[1:17:01] otherwise you have no reward of your
[1:17:02] father which is in heaven therefore was
[1:17:04] I just going alms do not send a chucker
[1:17:07] before thee as the hypocrites do in the
[1:17:08] synagogues and in the streets that they
[1:17:10] may have the glory of men barely I say
[1:17:13] to you they have their reward when I
[1:17:15] just um let thought I left him know if
[1:17:17] thy right hand do this but thine alms
[1:17:19] may be in secret and that they father
[1:17:21] and thy father which seeth in secret
[1:17:23] himself shall reward thee openly thank
[1:17:27] you so almsgiving is a private way to
[1:17:30] have virtue he says take heed
[1:17:35] which means pay special attention to do
[1:17:38] your giving in secret and not before
[1:17:42] other people see it takes virtue to give
[1:17:48] in secret don't sound the trumpet that's
[1:17:52] what a hypocrite does yeah I like
[1:17:55] churches that have ministries for the
[1:17:57] poor but they put all their giving on
[1:17:59] Facebook that's like that's a modern-day
[1:18:01] trumpet look what I've done
[1:18:03] yeah look what we're doing I think it
[1:18:07] might be all right sometimes maybe you
[1:18:09] know I just as a witness or something
[1:18:10] like that to get people to rejoice but
[1:18:13] Jesus says try to do it in secret don't
[1:18:15] sound the trumpet before you so when we
[1:18:23] seek the glory of man that shows were
[1:18:26] hip hypocritical we're lacking the
[1:18:29] virtue of the Holy Spirit but when you
[1:18:32] have holy spirit virtue you do it for
[1:18:34] God's glory you have strength to keep it
[1:18:37] just between you and God and that
[1:18:39] individual okay so let's finish with
[1:18:46] this I got ten minutes let's finish with
[1:18:48] this neck
[1:18:49] section I just want to show this is more
[1:18:52] of a message subject you'd be familiar
[1:18:55] with if you listened to the sermon
[1:18:56] called a statue preferred man beautiful
[1:18:58] sermon I think it's about two and a half
[1:18:59] hours but there's one statement that
[1:19:03] needs to be balanced a little bit and
[1:19:06] I've heard of preached I've heard
[1:19:08] preached wrong on a YouTube video so
[1:19:11] brother Brad makes a statement and when
[1:19:14] he brother man preaches on virtue he
[1:19:16] uses the scripture from mark 5 and Luke
[1:19:18] 6 that says the woman with the bloody
[1:19:21] issue touched Jesus and virtue went out
[1:19:25] of him and brother Branham uses that
[1:19:27] scripture to say see we have to have
[1:19:28] virtue coming out of us and so a lot of
[1:19:31] people misunderstand that and they say
[1:19:34] well the preacher that I breacher said
[1:19:37] if someone hasn't touched you and
[1:19:39] they've got healed from their sickness
[1:19:41] that you don't have virtue
[1:19:43] that's an awful false doctrine but see
[1:19:48] they just misunderstood brother
[1:19:49] branham's statement that he's making and
[1:19:54] so to understand this we have to know
[1:19:56] the difference of healing virtue versus
[1:19:58] regular regular virtue okay because
[1:20:01] there's two different they're two
[1:20:03] different things okay
[1:20:06] so healing virtue is another way to say
[1:20:09] the gift of healing okay so enjoy when
[1:20:14] that woman touched Jesus and virtue went
[1:20:16] out that was basically the gift of
[1:20:18] healing right maybe the gift of miracles
[1:20:22] it wasn't the virtue we're talking about
[1:20:25] which is the second attribute of a
[1:20:28] Christian faith virtue that's not the
[1:20:30] merchant we're talking about Jesus's
[1:20:33] virtue was divine healing virtue or
[1:20:35] maybe a miracle gift of miracle virtue
[1:20:38] okay
[1:20:40] so let's prove that by the scripture
[1:20:43] Malachi if you get the next one here
[1:20:50] first print
[1:20:52] 12 29 and 30 so you know the story of a
[1:20:56] woman this is one time for the father
[1:20:59] didn't tell Jesus what was going to
[1:21:00] happen so Jesus could just gets touched
[1:21:03] and he's like who touched me he didn't
[1:21:05] know God didn't tell us son everything
[1:21:07] right jesus's flesh did not know
[1:21:10] everything and so when he made the
[1:21:13] request she humbly comes and says yeah
[1:21:15] it was me and jesus honors her faith he
[1:21:18] said daughter your faith is Maj Hall go
[1:21:21] in peace
[1:21:22] be whole of thy plagues so Jesus heal
[1:21:24] the plague just like he heals the
[1:21:26] plagues of coronavirus praise God so
[1:21:32] that's a good example of Jesus had the
[1:21:34] gift of miracles the gift of divine
[1:21:36] healing we'd say but healing virtue does
[1:21:40] not lie in every Christian that gift of
[1:21:43] healing is not in every Christian so now
[1:21:45] guys gonna read it first Corinthians 12
[1:21:47] 29 and 30 go everybody prophets are all
[1:21:52] teachers because America how about a
[1:21:55] gift of healing do all speak with
[1:21:57] tongues go interpret but covet earnestly
[1:21:59] the best gifts and yet show I do to you
[1:22:02] a more excellent way alright thank you
[1:22:05] okay so see is every Christian an
[1:22:07] apostle does every Christian go overseas
[1:22:09] and preach and start churches no is
[1:22:12] every Christian an interpreter of
[1:22:17] unknown tongues no so the same is true
[1:22:21] here not every person has the gift of
[1:22:23] divine healing or miracles in that so
[1:22:26] that you touch them they can feel the
[1:22:29] healing process start now I've prayed
[1:22:32] for numerous people on member acam
[1:22:34] Church in other places where I prayed
[1:22:36] for them and they felt the healing power
[1:22:39] go through them I can't remember the
[1:22:41] brother's wife's name but the brother
[1:22:45] goes to cams Church and his wife years
[1:22:47] ago this is probably 10 years ago I
[1:22:49] prayed for her to revival service and
[1:22:52] she felt the healing she had nerve
[1:22:54] trouble on her back and everything and
[1:22:55] she felt the healing go through her so I
[1:22:58] you know it just has a testimony that's
[1:23:01] happened in my ministry people have felt
[1:23:04] the virtue flow out
[1:23:05] into them but that's not all the time
[1:23:10] and not everybody has to have that
[1:23:12] because he says do all have the gifts of
[1:23:14] healing no Larry that's another thing so
[1:23:19] Lord willing we'll cover there go there
[1:23:22] in a couple of weeks and Brotherhood ere
[1:23:24] he could ask his wife now she left a
[1:23:26] message
[1:23:26] sadly but she got healed in our revival
[1:23:31] meetings about ten years ago so we see
[1:23:40] that the Jesus's virtue to heal was not
[1:23:43] the virtue we're talking about it's two
[1:23:45] different things
[1:23:46] both were powers but one is power to
[1:23:49] live a godly life publicly and privately
[1:23:53] and the other is power to actually bring
[1:23:56] healing to people's body to different
[1:23:59] things so we don't want to confuse them
[1:24:01] if you do that again you'll have people
[1:24:04] seeking the gifts rather than the giver
[1:24:07] praise God you have to see that you have
[1:24:11] to see that we must seek the giver of
[1:24:13] the gifts and while doing that God will
[1:24:15] use us in little gifts every time every
[1:24:20] time that's happened where you know God
[1:24:21] has healed somebody through a prayer
[1:24:23] might I'm really just unaware of it
[1:24:25] I'm just obeying God's Word many times I
[1:24:28] don't feel it I'm just believing it and
[1:24:29] then it happens and that's that's what
[1:24:32] we find Jesus said apart from me you can
[1:24:34] do nothing so I always want to realize
[1:24:37] I'm nothing we want to realize we're
[1:24:38] nothing we just want to obey God's Word
[1:24:41] you and ourselves to God's Holy Spirit
[1:24:43] and then God will do the work it's not
[1:24:46] in our time it's not our season it's not
[1:24:48] by our might but by God's Spirit saith
[1:24:51] the Lord all right so I think I'll stop
[1:24:57] right there about 54 minutes praise the
[1:25:00] Lord I'll stop right there next time
[1:25:02] it's going to be a good message
[1:25:03] maybe I'll preach it Sunday as well
[1:25:07] we're going to show how Peter gained
[1:25:10] virtues and then lost I'm sorry game
