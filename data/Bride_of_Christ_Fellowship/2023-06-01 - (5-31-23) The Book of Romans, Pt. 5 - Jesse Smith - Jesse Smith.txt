========================================

sir let's go to Romans chapter 3 verse one I'd like to continue on the book of Romans here by the grace of God Romans chapter 3 verse 1. Romans chapter 3 verse 1. Romans chapter 3 verse one praise God of course we're still in the section here that the whole world is guilty before God but by God's grace by then the chapter we'll get to the next section how we are justified by faith as brother Ram said it's as though we never did it in the first place because that speaks of the righteousness of Christ Christ's righteousness being shared with us or given to us as a gift of love praise God how can we not love in church for all that he's done amen just in that given us his righteousness what more could we ask for praise God Hallelujah Romans 3 verse 1. we'll just read verses one and two I think on my notes I had we'll read verse one two and three but let's just read verses one and two I think we can all read that verses one and two by God's grace so let's read that on three one two three what advantage then hath the Jew or what prophet is there of circumcision much every way chiefly because that unto them were committed the Oracles of God Amen let's have a word one more word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's make a note into God somehow God seems every heart tonight we know God's word is eternal Hallelujah we know it was forever so in heaven and we know this day was ordained and predestined for God to feed our hungry Souls the word of God so father God we thank you for tonight Lord God take these words now Lord anoint them to our hearts that we might understand Lord God hallelujah we know there's joy in Revelation Lord there's stimulation my Revelation stimulate is here tonight God in your divine presence bless the ones that come out to the house of God thank you for these faithful Saints the Lord Minister those who might be working tonight like brother amen and brother vangan and sister Sia probably at home watching the children so father God minister to each one every one of them I'm sure Jose's working tonight Lord I pray God you minister to him as well Lord God anyway I've forgotten Lord I pray you remember them Lord God I know you will because you're faithful Lord Jesus do not forget one Lord because you care so much so Lord anoint this word now I pray in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated there praise God I have a few slides here we'll show here tonight by God's grace I'm going to try to watch my time I think you know the last few weeks I've been preaching like an hour and a half on Wednesday so forgetting to set my watch so here let me set my watch here it's got a big we've got a busy night tomorrow night so it might have a late I don't have two late nights in a row we're trying to just watch our time we'll try to preach 45 minutes tonight here so let's look at this here now for schofield's outline we're still on part part one after the introduction uh we're seeing how the whole world is guilty before God but I wanted to finish chapter three hoping to get through chapter three tonight here by God's grace and then that will take us into the second section justification by faith as the solution for our guilt and shame Hallelujah so I think we'll we're able to gain a lot of great things out of this chapter here as I was going through it you know some of these verses are very important to us especially as Believers as Christians but also as message Believers here at the end time they're important for us as well so I know you'll be blessed here tonight by the grace of the Lord so let's look at our first verse here verse one what advantage is then hath the Jew or what prophet is there of circumcision because as we as we saw in chapter one and two you know all three groups are condemned whether you're the Gentile Pagan or the Gentile moralist or the the Jew that has the law all three are condemned right under sin but is there advantage to being a Jew Paul says yes in every way now every way that's quite a statement every way so think about your emotions right think about your relationships now think about worshiping God think about uh your feelings and and all your associations your friendships in every way possible having the law is better than not having it why because the Bible said the main reason is because God gave to the Jews the Oracles of God so it's much better it's better in every way to have thus saith the Lord right it's always better to have thus saith the Lord than to not have thus saith the Lord praise God and so this is the great Advantage though that the Jew had over the Gentile moralist and the Gentile Pagan Hallelujah and now he gets into this thought he says for what if some of the Jews did not believe shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect and now of course the answer is no it's on the next slide can can the Unfaithful ones um make God's word ineffective and Paul says no amen so it doesn't matter so it is like in this day can the can those who fall away from the message can can they hurt our faith in any way no right can the Muslims today hurt our faith in any way of course not can The Sinner who gets drunk tonight and goes out to the bar and lives immorally can they can they hurt our face somehow no there's no way to do it praise God Amen why because it's an individual Affair praise God thank God for that now here's why God forbid see God God would forbid this from happening that that the Sinners would would in some in some way uh impact the believer God forbid God God will always in other words anyone who wants to obey the word of God God will always stand with you hallelujah amen so he says yes let God be true but every man a liar as it is written now we're going to look at this in a moment what scripture he's talking about scriptures talking about David David wrote this in other words David wrote that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings and might us overcome when thou art judged okay so Paul says God forbid right God forbid that a sinner uh their unbelief in the law could could hurt a person who believed the law right because each one of us stand alone right like I always love what brother Adam says you know none of you will be able to stand there like my wife won't be able to stand with me I won't be able to stand with her when we stand before God now when rewards are given out I think we might Stand Together Hallelujah but but when we're being uh when we have to be accountable for our actions ultimately we stand alone praise God we've got to answer for the Deeds Done in our body praise God Hallelujah and so that you know that uh and I'm just I think I'll just share this thought you know some people feel so bad for the like the people that follow false teachers and and I do too I feel uh I feel bad for the you know like the 900 that follow Jim Jones to their deaths but at the same time they're responsible for their own decisions right and yes yes uh false teachers will have a greater punishment but at the same time if you're the elect of God you cannot be deceived in other words if you really want the truth then God will give you the truth praise God there's no one that can deceive you how many want to be saved praise God then there's no way the devil can make you be lost amen hallelujah praise God there's no one if you want the truth God is obligated to give you the truth praise God if you want to follow a real man of God if you want to follow a real ministry that's from God then God will give that to you praise God Hallelujah so I just want to make sure I say that as well you know we feel bad for those followers of the false teachers but at the same time they want it alive the Bible said they wanted teachers that would itch their ears they wanted to come to church and always have a tickle oh that that's funny that that's sweet that's cute that's what they want when they come to church which are sometimes not everything we hear is going to tickle our ears right in fact most times it's not right uh we want we want preachers who tell us the truth of God's word right we want ears that can hear praise God we want eyes that can see Hallelujah and so we thank God that we hear the true word of God now Paul here is citing David's repentant heart God forbid that Sinners would be able to impact the faith of believers and he says God is true but every man is a liar now here's where this comes from how we know where it comes from Psalm 51 it comes from David after his sin with Bathsheba now look what he says for I acknowledge my transgressions right the murder the adultery lying hiding it without I mean how many sins were in there many and my sin is ever before me David says but he says against thee and thee only have I sinned right and done this evil in thy sight now I just want you to catch us here now he quotes what he quotes this quote that Paul later used in Romans that thou now he's not you're not talking about him or somebody else he's talking about God he acknowledges sin before God that God might be justified when God speaks now God is always going to be justified right God's always going to be right God's always going to be true but but David's saying but David's saying I'm going to acknowledge my sin so that I never make God look like he's unfair right he's going to acknowledge that I'm the guilty one God is not the guilty one like the devil didn't make me do my sin right my husband didn't make me do it my wife didn't make me do my children didn't make me do it like Moses could say the people didn't make him Smite The Rock Moses did it he should add control over himself right so in other words we must take full responsibility for our sin and not blame anybody else David is saying well I'm not going to blame Bathsheba why was she a bathing outside well that's not the point he could have turned his head right and so does with each one of us and and Paul's saying we must take responsibility for our sin that God is always looked at as being just and God is God is righteous in all his judgments right God is just and fair so in other words we must always recognize our sins God is always right and man is always wrong right when it comes down to judgment right so Paul is saying here that God is always right and we must always take responsibility for our sin and not pass it off on anybody else now the difficult part is when you're hurt as a child or you're hurt and innocent and you're innocent that's a difficult part but that's not a sin that you have to confess right because it's not you didn't it just happened to you right but what what happens is the enemy tries to get you bitter over what happened and he tries to get a root of bitterness to work in us and we've got to overcome the root of bitterness the Bible said we must offer forgiveness as freely as we want Jesus to forgive us that's a special kind of a test that's a very difficult test when you're really innocent right but somebody hurts you but the it's God has allowed that for a test to to let you be like Christ amen that's why amen so you can be like Christ and you can offer forgiveness to those who don't deserve it because really you and I don't deserve forgiveness either that's a hard thing that's but that's true it's a hard thing especially when children are heard and or innocent adults are hurt which is awful it's awful but we must remember that that we've got a we've got a responsibility to go to God in prayer and God as we said God can meet all of our needs right and we must remember we go through difficult trials to make us more like Christ Hallelujah and also to express the love of Jesus Christ amen now this this this phrase has another application so this phrase let God be true Every Man a liar it has it has the application with David that we have to own up to our sins and we can't push our sins on somebody else We're not gonna do that in heaven we're not going to say well he made me do it or that preacher made me do it or that sister made me do it we're not gonna be able to point our fingers anybody else we're only going to point our fingers at ourselves so that's the first application now another application is I like how brother I'm uses this that the word of God is always right and every man or woman that tries to trip or twist of scripture is wrong so in this case he's using Catholicism in this in this chapter chapter 3 of the church age book and he says that is exactly what nickelatinum has come to they say never mind what God's word says you can't understand it we have to interpret it for you furthermore the Bible's not finished it has to change with the times and we will tell you what the changes are now that's what the whole lesbian and gay movement is doing right well the Bible doesn't really mean it's an Abomination it doesn't really mean that right it's trying to change the Bible for the times that we're in but brother Graham says that that's contrary to God's word because the Bible said God is true and every man is a liar whenever there's a conflict with the truth whenever we're not sure what's truth we must be trained always to go back to the scripture what does the Bible say that's a great question praise God my dad when he was first seeking God in 1983 which is foremost 40 years ago because it was October he was uh he was raised in a Catholic Church he was kind of a bullied by the the nuns he was thrown up against the lockers by the nuns I don't know if he told you that but he's really bullied by the nuns but when he when he first got a Bible he looked at it and then he said he heard a voice and said what did Jesus say and that's when he started reading the Bible I thought what a good lesson that is for all of us praise God right when we want to know about God I believe the holy spirit will say what did Jesus say about it praise God because Jesus said the Holy Ghost will speak of me Hallelujah right the Bible said the Holy Ghost will bring all things to remembrance and it will help us remember what Jesus said praise God well anyways this reminds me of my dad to hear that testimony he said Heaven Earth will pass away but not one word of God will fail so the people are led by people who presume to be what they are not they say they're Vickers of Christ it doesn't have to be a pope or a priest it can be any preacher right but what they are is Antichrist so anyone who changes the gospel in order to fit the the world or the culture is an antichrist Hallelujah we got to change our lives away from the culture to match the culture of the Bible hallelujah amen praise God and then he goes on to say in chapter six let God be true with every man a liar if you take away or add to that book God has promised that he will add plagues to those who add and take away from their part from The Book of Life if they dare to subtract from it revelation 22 18-19 now this quote reminded me of another quote I went looking for this today I just want to just emphasize this again and the reason I want to read this is because there's so many uh testimonies dreams or visions brother random had and sometimes the interpretation of them is unclear for example with the seven Thunders right we talked about that some of our precious friends believe seven Thunders one way I might believe it another way right or the seventh seal right or or any uh when is La going to sink in the ocean when is America going to be bombed all these questions we don't even have the answers on some of them right some of them we do some of them we don't but either way no matter what story from other Branham or what Vision he had or what dream or what sermon you're reading or listening to everything we we believe has to be taken back to the Bible right that's uh and that's you know when I talk with brothers and and I have questions what I ultimately do sister lead is I try to get them to say well what verse now do you have to back this up amen oh you leave well brother said this yeah I see brother said that but what Bible verse are you ultimately resting your understanding on and if they got a verse praise God well that might be right but if they don't have a verse and I'll say well okay you're allowed to have your opinion but if we're going to trust in something we got to trust in the word of God look what brother I said now someone said well that Seven Seals then brother Brown that will be revealed on the last day some great mystery how do we get closer to God no sir it can't be now what he's talking about is someone saying oh there's something outside the Bible that we need to know in the last days brother I said no sir we can't enter the Bible whosoever shall take one word from this Bible or one word to it his part will be taken the Book of Life what it is the Seven Seals is a revelation what has been missed back there to bring it's already wrote here it's in here it's to reveal what already has been written see because you can't add one thing to it or take one word from it the first chapter of the Bible in the beginning Genesis one woman didn't misbelieve it she just misinterpreted let Satan misinterpret her one word surely see and then from that caused all this trouble that was God speaking God's word and the last chapter of Revelation look brother man goes from Genesis with Eve to revelation what was the problem in Genesis Eve added to the word what's the warning in Revelation at the end don't add or don't want to take one word away I like that don't you like how the Bible does that it circles back to the beginning praise God right we all love stories that Circle back right and oh this is what happened in the beginning ah yeah we got the same theme from the beginning to the end oh I love movies like that good movies like that you know Godly movies I love books like that oh the same thought from the beginning is now at the end what a great way to end the book or what a great way to end the story same thing in the Bible the Bible starts off by saying don't add one word and the Bible Ends by saying don't add one word and if you don't add one word then there's a place for you in the New Jerusalem praise God oh what a promise amen if we just stay with what the Bible said then we're guaranteed a mansion in heaven or a room in heaven praise God we're guaranteed a place in that Holy City because we just said what the Bible said Hallelujah and we didn't take away from what the Bible said glory in the last chapter of Revelation Jesus himself the same God said whosoever shall take one word out or add one word to it the this is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ and the Seven Seals had the Mysteries hid of what it all was and it's supposed to open it in the last day at the later scene age at the end time thanks be to God that finishes the message to the church that finishes it when they look back and see what has been and see where it's all brought up to that finishes it the age of the church so laodicea is the last Church age right Hallelujah and the Bible is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ so let's apply that to today then we need to read Romans 3 and we need to find the revelation of Jesus Christ but what is the revelation of Jesus Christ so far we've seen that Jesus Christ cannot lie praise God every man lies but Jesus Christ can never lie praise God Church Jesus said before he left he said my peace I leave with you he also said my joy I leave with you he said because you're going to need it in this world so it is no lie it is the truth if you need peace Jesus's peace is here if you need Joy Jesus said I'm leaving my joy you can have joy here praise God Amen it's not a lie it's the truth Jesus always tells the truth hallelujah if someone takes away that Joy if somebody or the enemy tries to take away your peace or take away your joy you can rebuke the enemy and you can say Jesus said I can have peace Jesus said I can have joy I can live an overcoming life because God cannot lie Hallelujah oh thank God amen hallelujah thank you Jesus amen glory to God Amen now moving on to Romans 3 verse 5. but if our unrighteousness commends or demonstrates the righteousness of God what shall we say is God unrighteous who taketh Vengeance okay so in other words the our sin demonstrates that God is Holy right when someone sins all that shows is that God is Holy right this guy if there's Unholy there's got to be holy right and then is it okay for God to take vengeance the Bible said God forbid for then how should God judge the world so in other words God is righteous to judge the world in Vengeance because the wages of sin is death every action must have a consequence praise God God is Holy and anyone who sins against the holy God should be condemned because they broke God's law right that's what Romans 6 23 says praise God now Paul's answer for this is coming up it's almost three entire chapters it's the part of chapter 3 chapter 4 and part of chapter five how shall God judge the world well you all know it he'll judge it in righteousness we already read it in Chapter 2 as well he said when God will judge the secrets of men's Hearts according to my Gospel According to my good news Paul's letters are good news some people call Paul a woman hater some people call Brother Branham a woman hate her but that's not true they were a Bible they were Bible lovers praise God brother Adam said I love my Christian sisters right we're Christian sisters were were uh uh we're women lovers as long as they're Christian women praise God even we love our enemies praise God it's never it's never okay to hate our enemies we should love our enemies praise God so we're lovers of Sinners we're lovers of men that are sinners lovers and women with Christian love we don't want to see anybody lost right Hallelujah so we know God judges God will judge Everybody by the same gospel Hallelujah and each person has given a chance to repent of their sins and come to Christ but God is righteous by his Vengeance against sin he's righteous to judge it just like brothers says what if there was uh what if there was no laws right what if there was no law and people could drive 90 miles per hour down the road and run over children or run over whatever run over adults and there's no punishment for it what kind of place would that be what would that cause that would cause chaos right that would be ever that would mean everybody's a bounty hunter right if somebody did that to me I'm pain there'll be no justice but God is a God of Justice praise God we can trust in God God will give everybody what they're due God will pay everybody back either good or bad and that's a God that we love that's a God that we can trust that's a God I can serve praise God amen because he will give to every man and woman whenever they have invested in whatever they've done whatever they poured themselves into God will pay them back and it will be a fair thing amen now here's quite a statement here for if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory in other words when people lie it magnifies how true God is when there's all these lies in the world especially in the media and politics when there's so many lies that actually makes the truth abound unto more Glory like wow God's word is so much better than the politicians right listen to preaching is so much better than listen to politicians and the church said because they lie all the time they rep they misrepresent the truth but their lies make God's truth abound wow So Glorious it's so wonderful but Paul says because of that why yet am I also judged as a sinner so if my lie abounds to his glory and judgment why am I judged well we know the answer we're judged because sin has wages or sin has consequences right so we're getting into some deep things here by God's grace now look at this here now here's what some people say some people say let us do evil that good May Come well in other words like brothers said some people say oh I'm so saved now that I'm so saved I can never be lost they say now I'm going to go paint the town red brother random said so brother I knew some people that said I'm saved and I'm I'm never going to be lost so I'll just go get drunk and have adulteries and fornications I'll live like a devil because I'm going to be saved anyway and that is the Bible said that's that's sin right the Bible said that that's unrighteousness that's what the Bible says here here's what here's how Paul says it and not rather as we be slandishly reported and as some affirm that we say so some people are relying on Paul think about that you're the prophet of God and people are lying on you have you ever had a lie told on you and somebody said something that you didn't say how did it make you feel betrayed I've had numerous lives told on me I never said that that's not what I said that's not what I preached that's not what I taught on the video that's not what I said and you feel betrayed well join the club right because if you're speaking truth people are going to speak evil against you Hallelujah so they spoke against Paul and Jesus said if they hated the master how much more are they going to hate the Servants of the master they hated Jesus they're going to hate us sometimes right people are going to hate us because we're Christians but some people lied on Paul and they said Paul says let us do evil that good May Come and church that goes completely contrary to God's law we just preached on last Wednesday you reap whatever you sow so Paul some people lied on Paul and said well you can plant bad stuff and get good things Paul said God forbid that's not what I believe right and Paul said if anybody says that they'll be damned and their damnation is just anyone that says well I'm going to get good things because I sin so much they're they deserve to be judged anyone that says God doesn't care how I live I'm still going to get Grace anyone who says that they're Damned and the church said a lot of churches say that not message but a lot of churches say that they say you could live however you want and God's grace is always going to God's grace is always going to extend you God's grace extends to you as you trust in it and as you receive it the right way right now this reminded me of the scripture Jude 1 verse 4. remember damnation is deserved for all those who rejoice in evil now church we might get we might get tempted and actually enjoy partaking into sin but at some point when we get in the presence of God and we humble ourselves we feel bad for our sins right we shouldn't rejoice in our sins we should feel bad eventually I believe if you pray long enough or read your Bible long enough or close your eyes and talk to God long enough have communion with God you're going to feel condemned for your sin and you're going to feel bad that you did it because rejoicing in evil shows a sinful heart right here's what Jude 1 verse 4 says there are certain men crept in unawares look at that that means some people are going to try to creep in our church and we're not going to recognize it at first but they're going to try to creep in or into your life friends are going to call themselves Believers and they're going to try to creep into your life and try to get you to come under the condemnation of saying uh that Grace means you can do whatever you want right that's what's what Paul said that's what they said about Paul oh let's sin more so more God more of God's glory can come upon us God can show more Glory Paul said you deserve condemnation for that kind of thought don't continue sin that Grace May abound he says it later in chapter six should we continue and sin that Grace May abound should we keep sinning so God's grace is greater of course not God forbid as soon as you receive God's grace it should motivate you not to want to sin praise God all right praise God but can I say it like this men ordain the condemnation in other words they're serpent seed people right we don't know who they are at first but they will creep into churches and change Grace into lawlessness that's what that word means lawlessness there's no law but Church we're not under the law of Moses we're under the law of the spirit which is a better law praise God hallelujah it's still a law though if you plant good seeds you're going to reap spiritual blessings right that's the law of the Holy Spirit but if you grieve the Holy Spirit God's spirit will pull away from you That's the Law of the Holy Spirit and you repent and God's spirit comes back on you amen amen and so now we know people that say oh you can live however you want you're still going to heaven they're Lawless and they deny God now they they're probably saying Jesus loves you so they're not denying Jesus by name they're denying his word they're denying the Bible praise God they're not going to creep and no one's going to creep in here saying there's no Jesus and you guys need to follow me and you can you can do whatever you want and send it they're not going to deceive anybody like that they're going to creep in here like they have in other message churches saying Brothers it's okay to uh it's okay to smoke it's okay to cuss it's okay to uh it's okay to divorce and remarry another woman and you're still forgiven right or sisters it's okay for you to wear makeup or trim your hair wear the concealer or whatever they say or paint your finger or fingernails now that's going more towards worldliness right they're going to make it seem like all these things are okay and slowly going to try they're trying to slowly convince you and I that it's okay to sin and it's okay if you sin because God will show more grace we know better than that Hallelujah we got more mature people than that don't we Hallelujah we got some meat eating Christians in here today we got some meat eaters or we got a bunch of babies on bottles tonight which one do we got here are we message babies just drinking bottles and well I can do anything I want I still go to heaven nonsense no give me that stake of the word of God give me that steak and let me put my let me put my spiritual fork in there I'm going to chew on the word of God no my sin does not make grace abound right I want to crucify sin in my life that God's grace can abound hallelujah amen that God's spirit can manifest more in my life by crucifying the the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life and and all those three areas see they're going to deny God's word they're not going to deny the name of Jesus they're going to deny God's word Hallelujah verse 9. what then are we better than they no in no wise for we have before approved both Jews and Gentiles that they are all under sin in other words all are slaves to sin and honors Dominion so think about that whether the Jews had the law or not they were they still feel the same thing the Gentiles feel like you're constantly going to sin and fall short of God's glory you've got to constantly battle sin how many ever get tired of battling sin just wish you had a new body I often think that praise God we're all born under the sin nature we're born in sin shaped in iniquity the Bible says right in sin did our mothers conceive us right in other words a sin nature was in us from the conception of of Who We Are and all of us are under sin that's why I love what the Bible says you know people will say oh brother Jesse you don't know how hard my trial is well in one way I don't but another way I do because I know what it's like to battle sin there's no temptation a given among men that's not common to all men right it's either lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life so yeah there's certain things I've never maybe experienced that but there's probably things I've experienced you've never experienced before right we're all battling sin and we all should encourage one another to overcome sin praise God Glory verse 10. now we're getting here through the chapter here as it is written there's none righteous no not one think about that Enoch he wasn't righteous by his own merits he in other words Enoch took a Rapture but before that he was still sold under sin Enoch would still still sin right John the Baptist no man greater than John the Baptist in the Old Testament he still sinned at some time at some point right you name it no matter the man no matter how great he was he was he was not righteous of his own in other words each one that we have seem to be a real man of God or a real woman of God they had to learn amen they had to grow and righteousness just like we're going in righteousness praise God it got to grow in it but there's none that's righteous outside of Christ there's none that understandable brother Jesse or my pastor or my my mom they just understand everything they didn't understand it all on their own well my my brother my sister they're so righteous not on their own there's none that seeketh God well brother you don't understand I saw God so much well not on your own God Drew you to to Fellowship God invited you because you couldn't get to God unless he opened up the way to get to him because your sins kept you out praise God there's none that seeketh after God so none of us are righteous of our own none of us instantly understand God's word and none of us instantly seek after God we've all got to be taught how to seek after God Romans 3 12 they are all gone out of the way they're all together become unprofitable there's none that doeth good no not one what a statement and this ought to encourage Us by God's grace right we all know right in Hebrews 11 there's a Hall of Fame of faith how did they get in there did they get on there on their own church or they get in there by two words what two words do they get in there bye Hallelujah how'd they get in the Hall of Fame by God's faith they weren't automatically like that they had to accept God's word they had to believe God's word and they had to act on God's word just like you've got to act on God's word Hallelujah so no one just does good right they become altogether unprofitable this remind you know we would think oh brother random has so many visions and so many miracles that's true but I just heard it this week brother random said in the seventh seal he says you forget anything about me he said I'm a sinner saved by grace he said I'm not fit to live and he said I'm not saying that to be humble he says but God has let my poor dimming eyes amen he said look beyond the curtain of time praise God could give us the revelation of the Seven Seals because God had mercy on him and God let him look beyond the curtain of time amen thank God that God let you look in the book and you can see that the mystery of God is finished praise God and that there's one name to the fathers and Holy Ghost it's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah God let your dimming eyes right one day there'll be dimming of God Dairies I asked Master McRae he's my he's our Taekwondo instructor he said most people said your eyes go out at 40 40 years old he said mine didn't go out till 58. I said you got 18 extra years of good eyes I said I'm going to take that I'm going to I'm gonna go beyond 18 there I'm gonna go to maybe 68 then my eyes will start dimming or something like that I'll take that Hallelujah bye but you know church we are what we are because God has given us I Salve that we can see the word of God we weren't just automatically good from our mother's womb right now here's what it goes on to say now remember this is this is talking about every person their throat is an open grave a picture just picture an animal on the side of the road that's maybe I just we drive by them every day now right I drove by a couple groundhogs today you know they're on the in the road flies all around well this is this is a little different this is an open grave where a dead body's exposed and that's what Paul Compares our mouths to and the church said in other words sometimes we say the nastiest things sometimes we say the grossest or the dirtiest things sometimes we say some of the most awful things and I'm not talking about when we were Sinners I'm talking about when we're saved yeah that's right I'm gonna show you just a few some simple examples you're familiar with them with their tongues they've used deceit the poison of ASP which is a Egyptian cobra is under their lips you know we sometimes we don't even realize that like wow we always you know we always bash the devil the devil's a liar Devil's liar well the Bible says you have some because your sin nature you have part of that nature under your tongue right if we're not careful that serpent that sinful nature is right under our tongue too that's why Glory that's why Isaiah said Lord send the coal from the altar amen hallelujah let your Holy Fire touch my tongue so I don't utter uh poison the poisonous uh uh the poison of Satan let me speak the holy things of God hallelujah amen can I say like this God send the holy fire tonight give us a fresh anointing that our mouths will speak the word of God hallelujah and not poison from an Egyptian Cobra as we'll read here in a moment now I might give us a lesson on this later we'll see maybe out in the fellowship room he'll tell us all about the size and the weight and how you can overcome it by God's grace the antidote that's what I'm thinking of the animal what's the antidote brother brother Malachi what do I got to pack in my uh my fanny pack but there's poison under your lips if we're not careful whose mouth is full of cursing right sometimes instead of blessing people what do we do curse them that's poison and bitterness instead of just freely oh I forgive that person I forgive that person that cut me off on the highway instead of instead of blessing them right or instead of being happy we get bitter with them their feet are Swift to shed blood so they're quickly going to get Vengeance I'm going to get them back I'm going to show them who's smart and who's got the right answers here here I'm going to show them who's the real good good who's the good person right I'm gonna show them who's right now here's here's the definition of ass okay so you can help us out with this one and Ash was the small and most venomous serpent the bite of which is fatal unless the bitten part immediately be cut away so you had to give away a body part if you were if you're bending on the arm but on the leg you ought to be an amputee apparently does that sound familiar America maybe okay this was probably the Egyptian cobra a small and very poisonous snake that dwells in the holes of the walls and a snake on which the serpent Charmers practice their art okay so anytime you're walking by a wall a serpent could pop out there and then it's life or death you better get it amputated or you're done it's going to spread all over right and this is what is spoken this is what the Bible says this is how we're born right we're born with poison under there and then every day we got to bring it under subjection so we don't curse people we don't get bitter towards people what did remember David David said he said I want to number the people he spoke that with his mouth and God despised it what did God do he killed seventy thousand look at the bite of the serpent brother awesome one man pridefully says I wouldn't know how many people are in My Kingdom and because he spoke that 70 000 people died Satan moved him to say that the Bible says now God was pouring out his judgment also on these the Israelites who were unfaithful to God God used that Sin from David to bring temporary judgment upon these people but look at that just saying I want to know how great I am I don't know how much I'm strong man I wouldn't know that just that just speaking something like that seems so harmless it brought death in church he'd already danced around like we said he'd already dance around the ark and worship God see so say person who's sanctified can still utter things that cause pain and especially preachers that's why they're going to be judged more harshly praise God it's almost 40 minutes all right goodness 70 000 people that that serpent had anointed Satan or anointed David and then David spoke death upon the people how about Peter Peter said I'll die with you I'll never deny you what happened he denied him three times and then when he finally realized that he went out and wept bitterly see we got to be careful I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do that I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do that we better be careful I would never do this I would never say that you better be careful that might be the poison aspers coming out of our our mouth right the poisonous snake we gotta be very careful what we say that lie was right under Peter's tongue and he'd already walked on water he'd already had the keys to the kingdom I got the authority of the messiah's Kingdom I've got that Authority and yet he so quickly spoke something that was wrong may God help us praise God I'll never I'll never struggle with this I'll never have a problem with anybody in the church I always love everybody in the church my marriage is always going to be perfect I'm always going to be the best parent ever I'm never going to make my children ever have any trouble poison they're watching you they're watching me right you better be careful what we say because it might be prideful this case both both cases were Pride I'll never deny you right I want to know how great I am so see church is not just Sinners that sometimes say that all of us sometimes have a poison under if we're not careful praise God not a lot of shouts tonight but hopefully there's a couple of amens out there destruction and misery are in their ways everyone every person and the way of peace they have not known right so Sinners have no peace I don't care they try to drown it out with alcohol like I saw my uncle at the graduation party Austin asked me I got I get to witness yeah I got to witness a lot about Jesus at the graduation party but I was talking to my uncle and he said he said I said how you feeling I said he said well my hips are doing good he said but I'm still having pain because of my weight I can't lose weight I said well you know just came to me I said just got to stop eating sugar do you eat any sugar he's like oh yeah I drink rum there's a lot of sugar and rum alcohol he said I could never quit that I said yes you can right I said yes you can and you know what he said to me before we left he said pray for me so I've got to remember to pray for him so as a prayer request I forgot but God's grace but see he didn't have any peace he's never had peace since he was a young man he was in the military and he's running from Jesus Simon's had conversations with him he has no peace so I said drown it out with alcohol because he has no Peace church if only he could come to this service one time or go to Kansas one time and find his place at the altar brother Austin he never thirsts again hallelujah amen he never thirsts for a room again because he'd be satisfied with the Living Waters of the Holy Spirit praise God oh hallelujah praise God I never go back to Coronas brother Austin I never go back to chewing tobacco because I'm tasting something better it's the life of Jesus Christ it's eternal life Hallelujah I'll never thirst again Hallelujah amen praise God that woman at the well would never thirst for another man again you and I will never thirst for sin again Hallelujah to live in that way again because we met Jesus Christ because we received Grace Hallelujah amen there's no fear of God Before Their Eyes speaking of a sinner right when we when we have the fear of God what does it give us wisdom and then the Bible said also understanding if we have the fear of God to help us to understand our path understand our life now you know this we don't have to read all this but the Bible said in heaven they said who's worthy to take the book right and John was weeping because no one could take God's book of redemption and open it and show what the Seven Seals were think about that he was crying because he didn't he thought he'd never get to understand the Seven Seals but we understand and praise God hallelujah we understand him today right and then he's crying and all of a sudden they said weep not there's my 45 minutes all right somebody's playing around with my watch that's what I think it is somebody hacked my watch but he was crying and he was he was saying nobody's worthy now think about that church Noah wasn't worthy because he got drunk Adam wasn't worthy because he found the beginning Abraham wasn't worthy because he lied and he laughed at God thus saith the Lord he doubted God's word Isaac lied right Sarah laughed at God David uh murdered and was an adulterer Joseph even lied and you can go down through every Bible character and they were all unworthy nobody's worthy but finally a lamb steps forth as he was slain so we know the only one that's Worthy is someone who would sacrifice himself for other people praise God and church that's what we've got to learn to do live our lives as a Living Sacrifice unto Christ right a sacrifice unto God but we see here Jesus the only one Worthy is a man who was holy and he gave himself as a sacrifice praise God in other words he was worthy to loose the Seven Seals Hallelujah because he paid the price of redemption he met God's requirement praise God he took the wrath of God on him and therefore he's worthy praise God amen Hallelujah no man was found worthy there was no man even in the Hall of Fame of Faith there's no one Moses none of them Moses was a murderer Moses didn't circumcise his children right you would have died by an Angel no man was worthy only Jesus is Worthy praise God and he bought church he bought you with the price so therefore Church let's glorify God in our bodies and in our Spirits or Minds because they're Gods Hallelujah now Romans 3 19. I'm almost done here now we know that what things so ever the law saith is saith to them who are under the law the law had to be sent to somebody so if you have the law speaking to you that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God therefore by the Deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin so the law explains what sin is and no flesh can keep all the law so all are guilty before God very simple right now we're done with part one now we can move on to part two we should have a little more joy now we're getting into part two praise God I appreciate it pretty hard right on the battles we go through we all battle with being a legalist are we all battle with uh Temptations right but now we move on here's how God is going to judge he's going to judge by justifying Believers by faith that is the solution for our guilt problem in other words sicilina none of us are ever going to be good enough for heaven we've got to believe in Christ's Sacrifice by faith well none of us can trust in our own Works to get there we've got to have confidence in the sacrifice of that lamb praise God the worthy one we have to trust in the worthy one praise God verse 21 now we're breaking this next section but now the righteousness of God without or apart from the law is Manifest being witnessed by the law and the prophets now all these prophets habakkuk Isaiah and Daniel and even uh the Psalms Prophet that might be David they all spoke that God was going to give us righteousness without even earning it all these prophets foretold God was going to give a gift of Grace that was unmerited God was going to be merciful and just forgive us by faith in his sacrifice amen praise God and it laid there for for 1500 years they had the law of Moses it laid there until Christ came and then Christ anointed to Paul and Paul brings out all these promises wow it was laying there the whole time I can't earn it I could never earn it someone had to pay the price for me and now I get the free gift of Jesus's righteousness praise God oh thank God hallelujah thank God amen for time's sake I don't think I'm going to read all those but also another note is the Old Testament also foretold the baptism of the Holy Ghost which was Christ in you the hope of glory it was foretold so your forgiveness was foretold and your feeling of the Holy Ghost was foretold praise God it was laying right there the whole time Joel wrote about it Jeremiah wrote about it and Ezekiel wrote about the permanent anointing of the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah Joel said it was God freely pouring out his Spirit upon Believers of all ages and Peter validated Joel by quoting him in Acts 2. so Joel said it Joel said God will pour out his spear like I preached that series I will pour out my spirit saith the Lord and he sure did over there in Napoleon but church he can still pour it out here tonight praise God Hallelujah we don't have to go back to Napoleon to get a fresh porn out Hallelujah we get a fresh blessing tonight praise God amen second Jeremiah said the baptism of the Holy Ghost was God writing his commands upon the hearts of his believing children praise God that's in Jeremiah 31 verse 33. he said in that day they won't just read the word he said but I will write my Commandments upon their hearts praise God in other words sister who you don't have to memorize the Bible so much it's already memorized in your soul praise God Hallelujah right right brother right sisters it's God's spirit wants to write it on your soul Hallelujah and yes we need to rehearse in our minds but the main thing is get God's word in your soul so that your nature is the nature of Christ Hallelujah and that your mind wants to agree with the nature in your soul your mind wants to do what you know is right in your soul praise God the Old Testament wrote about this it was laying there for 1500 years oh thank God and lastly Ezekiel 36 is mentioned in Hebrews 8 10. where God's spirit within you would cause you to walk in God's statutes to keep them and do them so church it's not you and me it's not our strength that's obeying the word every day it's God's spirit that's within us praise God we're just yielding to God's spirit say Lord have your way I'm going to go another day without getting drunk I'm going to go another day without smoking cigarettes I'm just you I'm just saying Lord have your way what a blessing what a tremendous anointing that we can have praise God what a what a reward that we have praise God just by surrendering and letting God have his way in our lives praise God oh what a blessing it was all foretold Hallelujah thank God how many more I got to go okay even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ upon all let's all say all ready oh and upon all say all again all it's unto and it's upon you it's to you and it's on you if you believe how do you believe in Jesus Hallelujah then God's grace God's rights is sent to you and God's righteousness is on you praise God amen that's why when our sister who was singing at the job those years ago she's singing about Jesus and then those two guys want to come to church see that's the righteousness of Christ on you sister that's God's righteousness and people see it praise God Hallelujah When We believe We glorify God when we believe we hear God's word hallelujah like we just had friends over last night and they said like so many people say they say your house is different that brother said I feel peace here he said I've been to a lot of homes he said I don't feel peace they only got two kids he said you got eight and I feel peace I said well that's just the grace of God I said that's my wife give my wife credit for that but he said your children are different he said you've done something different so I tried to tell him I said God sent brother Brandon I preach Brothers message it's a bible message I don't know if you heard that but try to tell me about it he said you wrote that book with a thousand Pages it's not a thousand it's 800. I said you wrote that I said yeah and I had to shorten it the guy had me I had to shorten it I'd take out numerous pages because the binding wouldn't fit and I said brother that's what brother I said that's what brothers Revelation did it tied the whole Bible together and now I can understand the Bible you know why because the Bible said the mystery of God had to be finished praise God so somebody's got to finish it hallelujah amen somebody had to do it and it's been revealed to me it's been revealed to you amen our eyes can see blessed are your eyes blessed are your ears for you can see and hear God's word amen there's no difference between Jew and Gentile right all all can have God's righteousness on them sister Emma you can have God's righteousness just like I can we both can you were raising the message I wasn't we can both have God's righteousness because we both we both fall short of God's glory and God knew that so God had to send one person to take all of our sins away because we both fell short I could have said that to anybody right doesn't matter it doesn't matter there's no difference we're all Sinners we've all sinned and the church said we've all sinned and we've come short of the glory of God there's no difference really between any of us we've all sinned and God made a way that you can be righteous being justified freely that's a free gift Hallelujah a free gift amen how many free gifts have we received brother Austin these last few years we've received a lot of free gifts well even better than the gifts we've received has been the grace of God we've received Hallelujah it's just freely given like this woman keeps email me I'm going to email her tonight again she asked can I wear this under my skirt when it's cold can I wear this can I wear that she said I just don't want to go to hell I just want to like share the sermon with her one sin is not going to keep you out of heaven faith is going to get you to heaven praise God and if you love God he'll guide you into all truth praise God and yes we want to dress modestly yes we don't want to cross dress yes we want to uh live holy we want to present ourselves as a holy way but one little mistake is not going to take away Jesus righteousness and if you're really sincere and ask God God's going to show you about that one question in your life one sin is not going to send me to hell because Jesus paid for all my sins brother Austin he didn't pay for 99 of them but he prayed for a hundred percent of them praise God amen it's unto all and it's upon all who believe Jesus righteousness is upon your life praise God I'm trying to encourage you tonight by God's grace you are Justified freely without any cost you paid by his grace through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus what a blessing whom God has set forth to be a propitiation a mercy seat through faith in his blood see Church we've only got to trust in the blood of Jesus Christ have you ever seen that sometimes we have a song service or maybe amen usually it's with mine you know some of my songs we might not be into it but sometimes we'll turn to a song that's about the blood and that'll just change the whole thing there's a reason the songs about the blood to change the atmosphere because that's what we're saved by we are saved through faith in the blood when we sing about the blood all of us can say oh that's right I can't earn salvation Jesus paid for it and I can be happy about that because brother Jesse had to have the blood of Jesus shed for him just like I do praise God or brother random or Martin Luther or John Wesley whoever it is Donnie Reagan or whoever Cadre Diggs everybody everybody can rejoice in one thing the blood of Jesus Christ praise God amen thank God and the blood declares Jesus's righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the fair forbearance of God see all your pastors think about that think about your past now what have you done that you're ashamed of in your past you don't have to worry about it trust in Jesus confess your sins and Jesus already paid for it he remits the sins of your past Hallelujah I love that song and goodness of God brother Austin my past sins are not running after me God's Mercy is running after me I'm not scared on one day my past is going to catch up with me or one day they're going to find what I did as a sinner online because it was 1999 you know or 2001. even if of course I would feel ashamed of my past but I've already got I've already promised a great future praise God my past has already been erased in the mind of God brother Austin it's already been forgiven praise God there's no record of it who can lay charge to me praise God Amen amen who can lay any charge to God's elect how many chosen by God today the word elect means chosen if God chose you there's no charge that Satan can put on you because Jesus righteousness already purchase your forgiveness praise God oh my Hallelujah thank you Jesus we ought to say hallelujah together let's say hallelujah can we Hallelujah to declare I say at this time there's my hour his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus where is boasting them where's the preacher that's going to say I'm the greatest preacher of all time or I'm among them that's what they say today they haven't said it lately so I think I might have brought some correction to that I think I think I helped bring some correction out because I emailed one of the brothers and I haven't heard the other brother say it where's the boasting then it's excluded by what law can we boast on or what works no but by the law of Faith let's stand our feet I better stop I'm going to keep going I'll never stop it it's gonna be hard to stop musicians can come Hallelujah church I didn't get to it but I just want to just I'll just say it briefly we serve a god who's rich in Mercy we serve a God who pardons remember that scripture he's ready to part it think about it as bad as you feel and you're like oh I could ever confess this to God God's just great waiting there the whole time I'm waiting I'm waiting to come and tell me about it I wouldn't I just I can't wait till you're ready to confess that because I'm very difficulty I really want you to feel better son daughter I'm ready ready I'm ready to offer forgiveness but we're like oh how could I ever say how could ever confess I'm such a horrible message believer I could hardly be a Christian to God's like I'm ready because you're not going to brag on your Works in heaven you're not going to boast that you made it to heaven on your own you can never pay that yeah that price nobody can pay that we're talking about the God who forgives we're talking about the God let me remind you who forgave the Gibby nights sister Emma of 400 years of sins God said I'm going to kill every nation in the Promised Land and I'm going to do it because I've let the cup of iniquity come up for 400 years and God was ready to destroy them with Joshua but then they tricked Joshua and Joshua said you won't die by the name of the Lord and because Joshua spoke in the name of Lord and offered forgiveness of the giving nights God was so quick to Pardon I'll take 400 years think of all the sins I'll take 400 years of all you give me nights and I'll just toss him in the sea and forgetfulness that's the God we serve 400 years brother Austin of sins and iniquities and and poison poison snakes poison asps poison from cobras all the lies and the murders and the abortions that they have the child sacrifices you know just the moment time sister Emma God's able to take the 400 years of sin and pardon that he said I'm ready to Pardon praise God we're talking about the God who resurrects Saints like like Moses we're talking about The God Who who took Moses's body from the Devil the devil said where is he sinned where's his body Michael where's his body Hallelujah and Michael just said the Lord rebuke you Satan God don't got to tell you what he did with Moses body but the devil's like well I tricked all Adam's race and I just that body's mine and and Michael said the Lord rebuke you we're talking about the God who don't have to give Satan what he wants amen Hallelujah hallelujah praise God we're talking about The God Who silences the voice of Satan Hallelujah by grace and by Mercy we're talking about the God who's rich in Mercy who's ready to Pardon amen Hallelujah and can take all your all your past sins all my past sins and all the past sins of every one of those Saints in the Hall of Fame of Faith he can take all their sin brother sister and toss in the sea of forgetfulness he said and separate it as far as the East is from the West next time you find the East you let me know and then you go find the West you let me know where it's at right that's what the Bible says as far as the East is from the West can never find it really it's just Polar Opposites in other words God has separated your sin so far from you you'll never have to deal with it praise God you'll never this is the this this is the gospel story this is good news brother Austin how do we leave the gospel's good news we've all fallen short there's no difference between us all but we're all saved by grace through faith it is a gift of God how are we thankful for that gift today let's bow our heads here father God we're thankful for Amazing Grace I'm thankful to serve a god who's ready to pardon my sin enemy tries to trick us to make us feel like we can't confess or we're not worthy of course we're not worthy there's only one that's worth thank you for the reminders that you're ready to pardon and there will be no boasting in heaven
