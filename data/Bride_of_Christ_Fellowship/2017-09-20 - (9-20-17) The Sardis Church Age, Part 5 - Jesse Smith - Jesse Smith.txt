the Scriptures remember I showed you all the scriptures at the end I want to make sure I cover those it is kind of the worthy one calls us worthy hallelujah what a tremendous privilege and honor amen that's going to be a revelation 3 verse 4 we're so happy to be in the house and Lord as you're turning there we had a good Bible Club at the Middle School on Tuesday morning we met at 7:15 and 10 kids came at 7:15 in the morning and I was really thankful to parents email me afterwards said the kids were so happy we're having Bible club at middle school and I'm just found the vision of one of the parents the parents said I want to see my child go through Arrowhead middle school and high school and have a ministry there the whole time so I'm just kind of found in that vision so we can train up disciples in the word of the Lord so we're very happy about that and then I met a teacher afterwards and she's like this place is evil she said we need a Bible club here and you know because demons start showing themselves more aggressively when do people get older so she said keep doing Bible club she said I'll come and pray sometimes I'm gonna hold her to that I'm gonna invite her to come and pray with us at 7 and 15 in the morning because that's what we should do but I was just so happy and so next week one of the guys got so excited he's like let's go through the halls before school like Joshua let's sing until the walls of these spiritual powers fall down so I thought well we'll pray about that that sounds pretty good one time my mom walked around a bar praying for years until they closed it and that was a wonderful testimony for my mother just like Joshua now we don't have to do natural we can do spiritual but there's something about going through the motion that might stir up faith and anything if a handkerchief was your faith God said that's okay because the handkerchief has no virtue it represents something and that's a walking around a building remember lima when we did I don't just think my wife might remember we used to Jericho marches around at the sanctuary I don't know if anybody ever did that before but there's really nothing to that but it's something that will raise our faith or something to remind us that God is with his people so just you keep praying for me by God's grace if you can for God to give me strength so revelation three verse four revelation three verse four we want to start there I want to look more of this thought of how we're worthy I want to go through all the requirements like I said I searched the whole New Testament for what makes a Christian worthy and what makes them unworthy and I want to show it to you in the scripture tonight by the grace of the Lord all right revelation three verse four let's read it together on three one two three thou hast a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy red-letter words Christ says they're some that are worthy that's beautiful let's bow our heads every need on your heart just make it known unto God as we pray have any father my head is bowel or but my heart is burning right now with love for you Lord to see red-letter words Lord and to hear Lord this as we read it that you actually call believers in Sardis worthy nor we know it was a dark age we know if there ever was zeal for denomination it was in the Sardis church age a father if you found a few worthy in sardis I believe you'll find a few worthy and Leona C and Lord lor we know it because you said there are some that are hot and there because they're hot for Christ they will sit on the throne with you Lord Jesus help us tonight Lord to examine our hearts and lives help us examine our motives and objectives and reveal Lord more of these scriptures to us so they can be a living reality about living worthy of the gospel Lord God we thank you Lord for tonight bless every heart and soul that press their way out to the house of God tonight Lorna's we're gonna read this scripture that those that are planted in the house of our God shall flourish in the courts of our Lord so father we give you glory tonight let the Holy Spirit have his free course help us not to hinder your move Lord in any way shape or form in Jesus Christ name the church said Amen god bless use me and see the praise the Lord so let's look at this thought here part 5 we want to look at they are worthy I just want to focus in again a little closer on that thought I think it'd be a blessing I didn't get to finish it I like to finish it praise the Lord and like to get through these quotations here the scriptures especially by the grace of God I'm not mistaken we only went over a few and the most important ones if you remember were the ones that we looked at where Jesus talked about to be a worthy disciple he said you must forsake your family right must forsake your family to be worthy one thing else I can't remember that right now I have to go back there let's go to Matthew chapter 10 I can remember that second one forsake your families anybody remember the other one take your family I can't remember who sort of so let's go Matt back to Matthew 10 forgive me I was thinking about it the whole way here and I forgot it let's go to Matthew 10 pardon me it was fate forsake your family and one more thing Matthew chapter 10 he gave us two indicators there oh yes the cross yes taking up your cross taking up your bird and that's it forgive me that's what I forgot let's read that though by the grace of the Lord amen praise oh let's read I'll reverse 37 he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me right and verse 38 that's why I want to get to and he that taketh not his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me either so there's a two-fold requirement of God at least of Jesus in this case that he had his 12 preachers right his 12 disciples this is what the 12 disciples preached here and he told him this he said that you must love me more than everyone in your family even your children and then he said the second thing was he said you must take up a cross and every day follow the Lord Jesus Christ that is a life that's where the gospel praise the Lord so Malachi I want you switch over here I think I'm ready now for the I got some more slides here by the grace of the Lord I just want to review that so I didn't forget that by the grace of God okay so this is part 5 here seem like this but I think we have the fear series in there and I'm still not done with that there are some more thoughts I want to look at fear but seemed like I was longer or further ahead in this series but maybe not Sunday we finished judgment we didn't finish eulogy so we're gonna just continue a little more on the eulogy and next time I'm back with you Lord willing I'll see you Wednesday next Wednesday we'll look at the promise deal over over comers which is the longest portion in the church age book it's 20 pages on the book of life how many remember that let's read the church age book the doctrine that gets the most number of pages is the book of life because he said you can't do a casual study on the book of life and actually understand that you have to do a deep study on the book of life so that's important or willing we'll look at that again next Wednesday if God's willing and nothing else comes to my heart I have a thought I want to preach but I haven't had time to get into it it's the thought of showing how men and women could be adopted in the Old Testament I wanted to show that thought but I think I'm gonna preach that this weekend I think I'll have time I think brother Brooks will preach Friday so I have all right off to preach or to study hopefully and then I'll preach Saturday so hopefully I have all day Friday the study and prepare that message but in that wouldn't that be so helpful for our sisters and also for our brothers who don't preach you know sometimes we look at men who preach that they can actually know their adopted you know like Jesus and brother branham how we can see we can clearly see how they were adopted you know hear ye him like brother Rams given the sword and weakens can't we clearly see okay we're supposed to listen this man he has the sword of the Lord kid can you guys see can everybody see that by the grace of God we can see how God's saying here this man but now it's a little different for sisters because they don't preach but God still wants the life of the sister to be heard and she can still always testify a woman can testify as much as she's able to hey men just like a man can testify as much as he's able to but I got this thought to go through the Old Testament and find women that were adopted or in other words stayed in their position and we're mature believers that God could speak to for example I got some good examples for you I'm gonna give you a little foretaste the hall-of-fame of faith in Hebrews 11 lists a couple women you remember some of the women Sarah she's known of all these men they're listed there Sarah placed in there after that there's another one remember another one Rahab there's two women specifically called out as being by faith or through faith she did this and so God clearly gives us examples of godly women who although not preachers not in the church leadership they lead by example praise God I love you cuz everybody everybody's a leader somehow somebody's gonna follow you by Branson everybody follows or knows what you do by what you say by how you live your life and so I want to go through the Old Testament show how jakka bed mine the Bible said she wasn't afraid of the Pharaohs command can you imagine Pharaoh he imagined the president Trump send you letters say all the babies to dunder gonna die and this is there something very similar that was a time of Jesus but in the days of Egypt jacoub had got a letter in the mail saying all the babies are gonna die and the Bible said she wasn't afraid of that so she placed her baby Moses in the are why is that brother Bram said because they prayed until they saw the angel the Lord so what does that mean for us we must pray until we hear the word of the Lord from the Holy Spirit praise God so there's an example of a very mature Christian woman who stayed in her position and had the word of the Lord I like that amen that's another thought I want to bring them but looking at adoption a little more and I want to look into that by the grace of God once you appreciate that I think that'd be really good I think it'd be so wonderful because you know we so often look at preachers can be adopted but what about the common person we're just we're just common I'm common too don't get me wrong I'm talking about Jesus and brother branham they were men with higher rank I'm a common person I'm nothing but us common people like you and I it'd be wonderful to see what a positionally placed Christian ought to be amen so hopefully hopefully the Lord will give me a good message on that by God's grace now I want to read over these quotes one more time Jesus said they shall walk with me in white that is what God said he'll bestow upon them for this upright walk that is part of their inheritance that he's reserved for them if they were willing to walk with him through the toils and snares of life and be an honor to him he was going to reward them he's not forgetful of our labor of love God will always recompense us for our efforts to please him so Jesus here gives us a little foretaste the Millennium is not going to be all about sitting around playing harps on clouds that's not what the Millenium is gonna be about the future homes not gonna be about us singing and playing harps and everybody just in a choir you know we are gonna do things in the in the Millenium we're gonna build houses and we're gonna rule over nations and they will be our servants praise God and they and then the future home these people outside the city will bring their fruits into the city the Bible said they bring their glory into the city so we're going to be walking around doing something we're gonna need our bodies amen we're gonna so Jesus says if you walk with me on earth and Akron I'll walk with you in the Millenium amen I'll walk with you in the future home can you imagine walking next to Jesus what a privilege only really the disciples got to do it on the earth in a physical body but you and I if we walk with his spirit now he'll will walk with his body later praise God that's a reward if you walk with me now I'll walk with you later amen and I like that reward so I'm gonna walk for Christ and this day I want to walk with him in the future home Loran said yes they'd walk through the world and had not partaking of it now let's stop right there remember the story brother Graham said when he went to a foreign country he said a shepherd brought his sheep right through the middle of the city remember that the marketplace and he said those sheep were so trained they passed by tables of produce like apples and all these things and dates and all these things and the sheep were so trained to the voice of the shepherd that they never reached out and started to eat in any of the food they just went past all those temptations and follow the voice of the shepherd amen and remember I'm said that's exactly like the Christian today we pass through the world and there's temptations on the right hand and on the left isn't there Church everywhere you look there's a temptation here temptation there to do this or do that but the real saints of God walk with Christ they keep their eyes on Christ why because they're taking up a cross they have a burden and they're following Jesus amen I love that see we're we're walking amongst this but we must not partake of it they not let the world systems overcome them when the illustrious names of that age had unit to the blandishments of the state since this speaking of Luther's day and chosen political mind in this rather than spiritual - and were on their way back into the world those few stood for the word of God and thereby honored the Lord I like that and then he says next now he would honor them in return for they shall walk with him in white they had identified themselves with him on earth and now he would identify himself with them in the New Jerusalem and how marvelous will be that identification praise God is that beautiful praise the Lord alright next one here it makes me rejoice and yet it makes me weep to think his condescension for you will note that he is not dressed in another color different from the Saints as earthly leaders would so do know they are like him he is like them they are like him even as John said they shall see him as he is praise God do you realize now here's where we get to this so I want to spend the rest of the time on here and I got about 45 minutes good for they are worthy do you realise who sang this it is Jesus the worthy one himself this is the only one who is accounted worthy to take the book out of the hand of him who sits upon the throne and now this worthy one is saying to a Saints you are worthy here is the one the only one qualified to judge and indeed all judgment is committed unto him and he says you are worthy that's a mouthful right there praise the Lord but the worthy one is the one who calls us worthy praise God now I got a few more scriptures I want to read this again these words are as astounding as are the words in Romans 8:33 God says I am righteous who shall lay any charge to God's elect for God is the one who justifies us now you can say here tonight and say brother Jesse preached some astounding words because it wasn't my words it was Christ who herds and program said these should be astounding to you that Jesus lets us know that God says I'm righteous you and I can't brag on how righteous we are but if God says we're righteous then who's gonna argue with God on an area and the only way we're righteous is when we meet his requirements and his Quran requirements are very little because the Bible said even a fool shall not err in God's requirements the highway of holiness the way of holiness it's so simple even a fool can't miss it if we just reach God's simple requirements glory there in the white light of God's righteousness hear the sweet voice of Jesus as he says these are mine they are righteous they're worthy they shall walk with me in white note we're worthy because God says we're worthy no doubt church a lot of people might have looked at Judas and said that guy's worthy boy he's he's preached three and a half years whether Bram said his ministry was no less than any of the other ones if you listen if you read the rest of the church age that's what he talks about in the book of life he spends a lot of time on Judas how his name was removed his anointing was just as powerful as the other brothers right his anointing now when he was under the anointing when he would get his sin out of his heart you know and get anointed and do miracles where the RAM said he had a Holy Ghost given ministry not Holy Ghost sealed ministry but just the Holy Ghost anointed ministry they would understand that his soul was never sealed now those brothers weren't either but eventually they were on the day of Pentecost eleven of them were you see but he had a Holy Ghost anointed ministry because Jesus I give you power to cast out demons I gave you power to heal the sick and raise the dead amen you see that so Judas here is one like this the Bible says here the Bible said he had a real ministry the Bible said an action after one that he had a part of the Apostleship of the Apostles and brother Branham said the thing that makes us shiver about Judas he said the reason we shiver when we hear the name of Judas is because he was given the highest calling in the Bible but he turned it down because there's no higher calling than to be an apostle to be a missionary for Jesus Christ and the church said there's no higher calling to leave your home and children and to leave your lands and preach the gospel to Jesus Christ to people that never heard it there's no higher life you could possibly live than that how many understand that to forsake your children or not not forsake them but just not be with them right they still you still got to give them food and make sure they're with their why their mother and everything like that but to leave your home and leave everything and go to a unknown land and preach the gospel of Jesus Christ there's no higher calling in the Bible and so that's what Judas left he left the highest calling in the Bible for some chump change for some money and brother man said he was fooled because he did the same thing that Balaam did at bale prbl PR said you guys come over worship with us works we're all the same we're all the same church and God killed 24 thousand then because they started fornicating with those bailet balaam women Amen remember that from numbers chapter 25 so Judas did the same thing he sold out he was tricked well I just I'll just be a little money here on the side and Jesus so maybe save himself or or we're all believers you know all these things I'll just take a little more money here I'll tell them where Jesus is at and the Bible said he found no place to repentance that's exactly right and I know that's some tough harsh truth but that's the Bible amen and the Bible has all the word of the truth for us amen the word of the Lord amen now I want to look at the word worthy here just a moment jesus said those who walk with me and white on this earth are worthy of me now our word worthy is this this is from my phone I just copied and pasted it you know here Webster's dictionary says it's an adjective so it's a describing word it means good and deserving respect praise or attention it means having good enough qualities to be considered important or useful huh me know you're important to God everyone is important to God you know why because he sent his son to die for you that's how he everybody is important for him even the sinner the Bible said God doesn't like when sinners die and go to hell God doesn't rejoice in the death of the wicked the Bible says God paid the price and of all the sin his son was sinless and he died for all of us and Jesus was saying I love you all all of you need to come to me but so many people will turn them down because of love of the world they love sin and Sexton and music and rock and roll and all kinds of things they love all those things more they love Christ how could you not love Christ more than that because Christ died for your sins amen how could you not love Christ more than that it shouldn't be easy at times to walk away from some of these things because of love amen because when you see God's love how can you not feel love for that if somebody does something good for you how can you not want to love them back again and no one here none of us can do anything close to what God did for us when he gave us Christ amen it's exactly right let's see we're worth we have to be worthy we have to be worthy of God's respect we have to be worthy we have to be important to God we have to live a life that's important to God we can't a waste away our lives so the full definition is having worth or value means honorable or merit to us I think I'm saying that right that's a fancy word I bought I'm not real good with that one now if you got your Bible go to 1st Samuel please 1st Samuel I believe it's chapter 29 that's enough I'm sorry chapter 2 I got some scriptures like I said I want to go through 1st Samuel to 29 yeah that's right first time into 29 good to see Benjamin god bless you sir and your friend name is Jamar unless the Lord amen all right first samuel 229 if you got your Bibles they're for Samuel 229 now give you the background on this God is giving a judgment against Eli he was a high priest in other words he's like the leader of the church at that time remember and God is giving him a word through the little child Samuel I'm gonna remove you and your family from being priests and you know the reason why because Eli honored his sons more than he honored God mm are being worthy is you're deserving of respect and honor your honorable your honorable so let's see how Eli dishonored the Lord because he lost his position he lost his preaching really he lost his ministry because he dishonored the Lord if he would have just honor the Lord he wouldn't remain a servant of the Lord First Samuel 229 wherefore kicky at my sacrifice and at my offering which I've commanded in my habitation and honors thy sons above me to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people let's stop right there remember Eli sons would intercept the people before they got to actually sacrifice the animals and they would cut them because remember the priest rightly divided the sacrifice remember that type of the New Testament how the minister has to rightly divide the Bible to you those sacrifices had to be rightly divided well God was supposed to get all the pieces that had the fat on him because God get all the fat it was a sin for Israel but Eli sons would intersect that and they would take those pieces and eat it until they actually started gaining weight Eli was so big when he died the Bible said he was a large man because he was eating too much fat that fat should have went to God so they were taking they were breaking the scripture to feed their flesh and how many people will do that today they'll break the scripture just to make their flesh happy right whether it's food or whatever it is movies whatever it is you know who you can make it whatever it is just to make their flesh happy just to make themselves comfortable when they would intersect that and take that and God is saying this you kick against my sacrifice and in other words you're ruining the worship the worship has a certain order and you're supposed to keep the order amen how many people ruin the song service because they come in here and they're bored singing their songs for God or they're falling asleep during the the preaching of the word when this is the only thing that will give them life because the word has life amen Jesus said my words are spirit and my words are life the whole time the words being preached the Holy Spirit's trying to say believe it believe it accept it act on it change your life repent the Holy Spirit is trying to give him the offering but they kick against it and deny it it's exactly right church and they honor their sons above me to make themselves fat with the cheapest of all the offerings look at verse 30 wherefore the Lord he said God of Israel saith I said indeed that thy house and the house of thy father should walk before me forever but now he saith be it far for me for them that honor me will I honor and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed praise God so how many want to be worthy of God's love I'm going to be worthy this is how you do it you honor God above everybody else then that sound familiar Jesus said he was worthy of me has to love me more than father mother children they have to obey my words above what their dad tells them or their grandpa or grandma right if they break God's Word and someone's telling you to break god's word you've got to deny and honor God's Word that's how you honor God and the second thing was I forgot was Eli sons were sleeping and having adultery with the people who women in the church right so that's the idea Eli was not honoring God he was honoring it himself and his sons by letting them have the food that was God's so taking part of God's offering and worship and also Eli should remove his sons for having adultery with the women in the church but he let them he said all it's okay they can keep preaching that would that's what it would be for us today oh they can keep playing song specials oh they can keep ministering and testifying in the church or speaking in tongues the church even though they're committing adultery and the Bible said if somebody commits adultery get that leaven out of the church are you with me amen but see Eli didn't have enough backbone to get his own sons out of the position so God said because of that you've honored me more than you've honored I'm sorry you've honored them more than you've honored me and so Eli was not worthy he was not honorable enough to be a priest of God how many love the Lord tonight see acne right so see God there is a honor that we can achieve it's not through our perfection it's through his perfection hallelujah it's exactly right now let's go look at a few more scriptures here so to be worthy of Jesus so far he's told us you have to forsake your family and put the word above everything that doesn't mean you leave him because remember if you don't provide for your family you're worse than an infidel right like men that don't provide for their children and wives they're worse than infidels so it doesn't mean don't provide for him it does it just means don't listen to them if they tell you to do something that's above the word obey the word first that's right so we obey the word first and then Jesus said he said then after that and once I'm first in your life you're worthy of me then take up a cross find a burden right find your ministry find your position and hold that position the rest of your days amen glory it's exactly right that's what Jesus said if you do that now you're worthy of eternal life that's exactly right now I want to make sure I do that now let's go to I told you I wrote let's read this Psalms 9212 Psalms 9212 Psalms 9212 our only hope is in the Word of God and where is the Word of God at it's in the house of God praise the Lord Psalms 9212 the righteous shall flourish like the palm tree he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon cedar trees are pretty thick from what I've read I've never seen one of their in a Palestine but I've heard they're really thick they're so thick that Solomon used them to build the temple of God which was the greatest structure ever built at that time verse 13 those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God they shall still bring forth fruit in old age they shall be fat and flourishing you like that the picture is of Moses is tabernacle or Solomon's tabernacle you had the house of God which was called the holy place and the holy place inside that was the holiest of Holies that was called the house of the Lord and the Bible says if you plant yourself in the house of God you'll flourish in the courts of God which are the outer courts can you picture can you picture us planning some blueberry bushes and here in Vaes apple trees or maybe some pumpkin vines picture us planting something in here because this is the house of the Lord and if we plant them here God will bless them pumpkin vine so much they'll grow out into the hallway and they'll grow right right out into the parking lot that's the picture God's given us that'd be some pretty mighty vegetables that'd be a pretty big I could see how a tree could do that break through the ceiling and everything like that to get to the light but that's what God says if you want to be fruitful for Jesus Christ he said plant yourself in the house of God and you'll flourish in the courts of God amen you will become so strong spiritually that your strength will be seen not just in church but seen out there in public amen that's exactly right that's the word of the Lord people outside the house of God have a point zero one chance to be saved and that's in first Peter 4 let's go first Peter 4 you remember this scarcely saved someone outside the house of God our scarcely saved it's gonna be almost impossible to be saved unless they do something nice to a Christian that's the only way they can be saved outside of the house of God I know that's rough but that is the scripture and not happy - happily meet anybody to show me any scripture that teaches any different I say that humbly now I would never argue anything like that but say humbly that is the word of the Lord first Peter chapter 4 I was back in heave of Hebrews parmie 1st Peter chapter 4 verse 17 now this tech context is talking about suffering for a Christian Paul said if you live wholly in this life you're gonna suffer persecution that's right to some degree you'll suffer persecution now the most severe I think I've had on me is that people at churches have labeled my name and say have nothing to do with that guy because I've talked to them and they've told me themselves now if people had people lie on me and say Jesse said this and that and come back and they asked me did you say that I didn't say that so people lied on me and they've warm pita me about that they've warned their people about me and their churches that's the most persecution I've got other than people just rejected me and not contact me anymore but we there's some level of persecution for people that live godly in Christ Jesus there is some level persecution 1st Peter 4:17 for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God and if at first begin at us where does judgment start right here how can people escape judgment if they're not even hearing what's being judged right you have to hear the judgments that you can escape them and at first begin to us what should be the end of them and that obey not the gospel so see we see a lot of things from there someone that's not even in the house of God they're not going you're the judgments of God and they're not even gonna obey God because they're not hearing the word of the Lord look at verse 18 and if the righteous scarcely be saved think of lot lot was scarcely saved the fiery left the city and then the fire fell scarcely saved he wasn't like Abraham who was living miles away from it the Bible said Abraham was so far he just saw the smoke of it but lot it was hot on his back and the angels had to pull him out god help us to live such a life we live so far away from sin that we don't feel the flames of heat of hail amen understand what I'm saying we should be so far removed away from sin that we should stand afar off and live such a godly righteous life that everybody knows I'm not of Sodom amen I'm not of the world I'm of Christ hallelujah I serve the only living God the Lord Jesus Christ exactly right and if the righteous scarcely say where should the ungodly and sinner appear remember judgment begins with us that's why we come to church so he can be judged amen who knows what happens when you miss a court date do they find you what happens when you miss the Courtney I know one time I had a court date because I hid some money in a car and I had to go to the court but I don't know what happened if I missed it I think they'd find me or something awful would happen a warrant for your arrest all right they put a warrant on you then you got this black cloud hanging over you're right I'm gonna get you sir or I'm gonna get you ma'am if you don't show up to the house of God I'm saying God wants his children to be in the house of God so that their lives can be judged they can be straightened out and they can hear the part near the pardoning words of the judge you're forgiven and you're worthy amen you confess your sins you met my requirements and you're forgiven hallelujah what if I went to this happened one time one time I had a speeding ticket what if I went to the municipal judge and okay they said okay the case is closed you're fine is $120 what if I walked in there or what if somebody walked in there and said Adam walked in they say judge hold on I'll pay his fine what does that do for me it saves me from being suffering the judgment right Adam says here's $120 let the man off the hook and I could say praise the Lord I I didn't have $120 something like that and that's exactly what Christ did for you the Bible said Christ paid your ransom let's put it at two trillion dollars that's how much it costs to get you out of jail and the blood of Jesus Christ paid your price amen you're free you know what this you there's no way you could pay it well that's what Christ did when he died for you all the sins of the world were put on him and he's you're worthy lamb you just have to believe in him and if you believe him you'll love him and you'll serve Him amen but if you love Satan the world you'll live for Satan in the world but if you love Christ you'll live for Christ amen because he paid your fine at the courtroom holiday there's no warrant over me God ain't looking to rest me or or chasing me or anything like that my debts been paid amen Christ that didn't paid for me and now I'm free as a bird as a eagle and I'm living for Jesus amen exactly right so we must be planted in the house of God then we'll flourish in the courts of our God how can we escape judgment if we don't come to the house of judgment to be judged or forgiven we can't we must come to the house of God for what God said we must come for forgiveness praise the Lord now let's look at a few more worthy scriptures here I got a few more scriptures now this is the ones we looked at on Sunday here right here we looked at these on Sunday and I want to go over these here here it says this we went over this John the Baptist said I'm not even worthy to loose the latchet of your sandals that's how holy Christ is we're not even worthy to take off his his shoes and and kiss his feet now God he loved God loves that though and someone will home with him selves but we're not even worthy to do it we are not even worthy to approach him but yet he's so loving and merciful he lets us approach him and then the roman centurion said jesus i'm not even worthy that you come over to my house just speak the word and it'll be done and jesus said I haven't found so great a faith even in Israel because the faith like that to Beach worthy of Jesus reward you must take up your cross daily amen you must have a burden you must have a position a burden that you hold all the days of your life serving Christ and you must also put Christ above your family and everybody else's ideas about everything that's exactly right jesus said here let's go this let's go to luke 21:36 this is all through the Bible you must be worthy you must meet God's requirements to escape the tribulation luke 21:36 so on this sermon I'm focusing more on what we do right I'm not focusing on how God is sovereign and it's all about God's saving it is all about that but God has to have something to base it upon and that's our faith or unbelief are we gonna choose to believe or choose to disbelief right so we're looking at that we're looking at the human choice today not so much how God is choosing we know God chooses right we know that but we don't know that that's all in God's mind we're looking at what men see not so much what God sees right as far as eternally and we'll look at that again next Wednesday we look at the book of life Lord willing Luke 21:36 but they men can you read that for me sir hey man so now we have more requirements to be worthy you have to watch and pray all the time if you want escape evil watch and pray that's what you have to do Jesus tells us we know how to be worthy whether I'm in the church a book he said how can a man know if he's right with God he said let that man obey the words of Christ and he know and then he'll know he'll heal the hurt he'll hear those words well done thou good and faithful servant hallelujah how do I know I'm worthy I've met his requirements I've done exactly what Jesus said I'm constantly watching and praying looking for the coming of the Lord and my life is lined up with God's Word exactly right the Rieger the disciples rejoiced that they were worthy to suffer for Christ and sometimes a we're not careful we can discourage if we have to suffer for Christ they rejoiced when they suffered for Christ because they knew I'm worthy but I'm living a life that's worthy of the gospel and we mention this I'm not going to read those because we don't have time suffering now is not worthy to be compared to the glory that's to come let's read that Romans 8:18 I do want to read that one Romans 8:18 any trial or any hard time you're going through right now whether it's like we heard of our prayer requests depression or temptation or loneliness or whatever maybe whatever you're going through right now it's nothing compared to the great blessings God has for you if you believe in his word Romans 8:18 this life is so short my Romans 8:18 for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us is I've been worthy to be compared it's so great it's so honorable eternal life and an eternal peace an eternal happiness is that you can't even compare it to the little things we suffer on this earth I know it's hard for some people to understand but it's the Bible truth I want to read a few of these also let's go let's go the next one let's go to first Corinthians 6:2 I want to read that one now this is a little different aspect of being worthy first Corinthians 6:2 so in this case one of the members of the church at Corinth was going to sue another member of the church like maybe like maybe uh maybe someone's gonna sue me who's that somebody's gonna sue me in the church they say brother Jesse didn't do this or that or he mistreated me all these things like that well the Bible said in verse 1 dare any of you having a matter against another go to law before the unjust and not before the Saints in other words Paul said I dare you who would dare to go to an unrighteous judge rather than come to the house of God what does that tell you or here if we got the real holy ghost there's more honour and justice here than in the courtroom the Summit County courtroom there's more honor and justice here why cuz we've got God's spirit here no one's trying to pay anybody off there's no political - the only headquarters were concerned about is heaven hallelujah making sure Jesus's word is fulfilled look at verse 2 do you not know that the Saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters huh look at that now powerful we think oh I'm going to get my day in court you don't know now people think that not a people thing I'm gonna get my day in court I'm finally gonna get my money back or whatever you see how they think and Paul said you're the ones that are worthy to judge now the trouble is people that will get like that they don't want to bring it before the church because they know they're gonna lose because they got a evil spirit on them and they know the real Holy Spirit will sniff that out yes some wrong there some wrong you know discern that evil spirit so the real Christian doesn't mind coming before bringing the matter before the church but it's the one who's wrong usually don't want to do that right unless there's a corrupt leaders then the person who's corrupt you get the karp leaders on their side then they'll come before the church but see how everybody's got to be fill with the Holy Ghost and if you remember you remember I think the Bible said here if I'm not mistaken I think Paul said find the least esteemed members in the church through the judging I think if I'm not mistaken is that right yes well I can't find it anybody find it which verse that was Yeah right there verse four and if then ye have judgments of things pertaining this life set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church not the most popular or rich people in the church the people who are the least esteemed they will give a true judgment why because they're not swayed by money only swayed by the Holy Ghost amen but see don't you know we're worthy to judge even the smallest matters well I've got this against the preacher for the so that I've got this against the person for this or that the person we should go to is the church we should go to that person individually right if they won't hear you then you'd bring somebody else usually just program said take a deacon with you okay you can bring me I'm the deacon and the pastor you can bring me if somebody hurts you in this church and they won't hear you they won't repent bring me if they were repenting for that then we give them 30 days or whatever time and if they don't get right with God get him out of the church and treat him like a heathen don't even look don't even listen to him that's how God's church is supposed to operate and people aren't going to toe the line get them out of the church they're just going to be a they're just gonna bring their sin and lust and destruction and temptation all these demon powers they're just gonna bring it in the church but God don't want any leaven in this church he wants a loaf that's free from sin hallelujah we're better off without sinning the church know if we're small even if we're smaller God would rather have a small lump of unleavened bread than a big old luf of puffed up sin God hates sin and God don't want sin in this church it's exactly right so this is a different kind of worthy when you become a mature Christian now you're worthy to judge even the smallest matters so see there's a level of worthiness or honor that we have as Christians in this life now we don't want to take communion unworthy the Bible said if we do that that's the reason many people get sick in the church and can't get over their sickness that's the reason many people die in the church is because they don't discern they don't judge God's body the right way they don't treat each other the right way that's why I've been laboring on that we got to make sure we get all the complexes out treat everybody the right way love everybody look past their faults love everybody with the love of Christ if not then things can happen to us get sick die other things all because we didn't treat the body of Christ the right way let's go to Ephesians 4:1 let's read those in Colossians 1:9 Paul says you must walk worthy of the invitation or vocation as the the King James word fusion is for one Asians for one how I do it on time okay for they two minutes oh my how did that happen visions for one I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherein you are called with all lowliness and meekness with long-suffering forbearing one another in love have patience with our brothers and sisters right have patience with them endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace praise God so look at that we're a prisoner of the Lord calls a prisoner Lord and we must walk worthy we must live we must live honorably like the one who called us is very honorable Colossians 1:9 let's go there ephesians philippians colossians i want you to see this here as we look at worthy the worthy one has to call us worthy colossians 1 9 through 11 for this cause we also since the day we heard do not cease to pray for you and is to desire that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding that you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing so that here's another way to know you're worthy I'm doing everything that pleases the father the father would not be displeased with the relationship that I'm in with the job that I have with what I do with my money the father would not be displeased he's pleased with what I do all pleasing this means you're worthy in other words you're living as close to God as you possibly can verse that's finished verse 10 they're being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God there's so much more we need to learn about God how many can say amen to that you don't have it all figured out I don't have it all figured out there's so much more we can grow in God absolutely there's so much more I can learn there's so much more I can humble myself in many ways but we got to be willing to do it verse 11 strengthened with all my seed from the Word of God we come here to get strengthened we come here to grow come here to to let our fruits go out into the world according to his glorious power unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness okay now again suffering makes you early we just went through that Peter said if you suffer you're worthy of the gospel we must suffer loss of family loss of money loss of anything job any anything you must suffer loss of anything just to stand on God's Word that's exactly right now here's what I want you to this is what you need to do if you can get nothing out of this sermon which I hope you get a lot because some of these things are astounding the brother Graham said if you get nothing else out let's to get this pray for people that they can live a worthy life if your life is worthy then you want to see other people live worthy so if you get nothing else remember that you can pray for people that they'll live a worthy life second Thessalonians 1 verse 10 which I know you'll get more than that but I'm just saying everything everything is the word of everything the Word of God is critical for us second Thessalonians 1 verse 10 and I read this to my children on Sunday night because I don't get to preach it you know excite kind of ran out of time I said children let's go to the scripture I want you to see this I show this to the children and I said let's pray remember the different people I call this when I said let's pray these people walk word remember that we prayed for some of our friends remember Lydia we pray for some of our friends we said God help them to live worthy of the gospel help them to live a hundred a life when the Christ just on Sunday night verse 10 and with all I'm sorry I'm in the wrong one yeah I'm in chapter 2 sorry 2nd Thessalonians chapter 1 verse 10 when he shall come to be glorified in his Saints and to be admired in all them that believe because our testimony among you was believed in that day wherefore also we pray always for you that our God would count you up worthy of this calling amen and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness and the work of faith with power that's beautiful Paul says he told his church in Thessaloniki Salonika I'm always praying for you that you walk worthy of the gospel that you've heard I'm always praying god help brother so-and-so help sister so-and-so let them live a life that's worth aghast when if Paul was doing that and he had the Holy Ghost if you got the Holy Ghost you'll do the same thing I don't understand that he was constantly praying for this little church god help them to walk worthy of the gospel glory let's go to first that's Ari first Timothy 5:17 let's read that one that's a good one this applies to preachers but of course it applies to everybody because everybody has influence in some capacity but this is particularly for preachers first Timothy 5:17 right after Thessalonians an elder of course is an elder in the office of a pastor elders that rule elder means you have a longer testimony of serving the Lord Jesus Christ but an elder who rules is has to be a preacher because the rule belongs to the fivefold ministry that rules that governs the church according to st. Paul let the elders that rule be counted worthy of double honor especially they who labor in the word and doctrine so when you have a preacher who's labored for years and years and years and word and doctrine you should give them double honor verse 18 for the scripture saith thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn and the labourer is worthy of his reward an elder someone who has years and years of faithful service under God that person is worthy of honor next one this one I want this now this is a warning we read this on Sunday night in our Bible study let's read again Hebrews 10:29 this is a warning scrips remember the flashing red lights children memory to death it's a warning Scripture Hebrews 10:29 let's take heed to the warning now can you read that you got that one Hebrews 10:29 thank you sir amen so doing this spite of the spirit of grace is disobeying the Holy Ghost how many one obey the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost can't give you anything outside of this word hallelujah because the Holy Ghost wrote the word and about said how much more sore punishment will someone get who takes the word and then tramples on it like Judas did Judas was given here you're you're a preacher in the message of the hour he was given that but he he trampled on it left and said I can't well I'm not gonna walk with these guys I'd rather take the thirty pieces of silver he left that behind can you imagine that after seeing the miracles and the storm calmed on the sea can you imagine a little bit of filthy lucre money seen a miracle and then trotting that underfoot can you imagine that and that's why God said he's worthy of more punishment he saw the great miracles of God remember Jesus even said it's gonna be worth it's gonna be worse on all these cities that have seen my miracles it'll be worse on them and Sodom and Gomorrah right because a greater than that is here today praise God Jesus was greater than all Abraham he's greater than all of them and to turn that down after seeing all those miracles the punishment will be far worse than what even the homosexuals received at Sodom and Gomorrah that's shot that's shocking that's but that's the Word of God it's this one you're a believers response to the gospel makes you worthy let's go to acts 1346 in this scripture I believe Paul and Barnabas we're trying to get Jews to believe that Jesus was the Christ and they started blaspheming so they were basically saying Oh Paul and Barnabas threw out the devil and look what Paul I think Barnabas said this acts 1346 I'm not mistaken they say all these guys are abused about these guys are devils all these things like this Acts 1346 so I guess it said they both said then Paul Barnabas wax bone said it was necessary that the Word of God should have first been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the Gentiles for so hath the lord commanded us saying I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles and thou should us be for salvation unto the ends of the earth amen so see a person's response whether they accept it or not where they say something good about or bad about it that is their own judgment upon themselves they're judging themselves that's right so see that's what we must consider remember and then what makes you unworthy of the wedding it's going to Matthew 22 we went over this briefly but let's read it again to refresh our hearts let's make sure we're not like these people making light of the wedding invitation Matthew 22 we cannot make light of the fact that Christ has invited us to his wedding and we search we're not just the invitation we're the one he's marrying we're the ones he wants to marry we're not just gonna watch there and stand and throw rice and wonderful go to sleep during the service we're the ones up there staring into our lover's eyes we're the one that everybody's honors and watches there's the bride here she comes give her salute stand and give her salute she's washed and why she's spotless she's holy amen she's just like Christ hallelujah hallelujah we're not just invited to attend we're invited to be the very one he marries now you remember this course Matthew 22 verse 2 the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain King who made a marriage first sun and set forth the servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not come to the rapture again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are bidden behold I prepared my dinner my ox and my fatlings are killed and all things are ready coming to the marriage but they made light of it it wasn't a heavy important issue in their lives it was just one of those we could go to church we could go to God's house we could do that but we could also do this or this or that with the Christian there's no choice you go to God's house because that's where God's Word is being judged right the truth is being judged that's where you can obey that the word of the Lord but see like now we could do that or we could do this they made light of it uh it's really not that important you can be still be saved maybe if you're nice to somebody who would ever take a chance like that that'd be foolish to take a chance like that well I'll try to get in on my last breath you don't even know if you have a last breath you know we know if you get to think about your last breath it's wise to obey God's Word now today's the day of salvation today is a day of repentance and they went their ways one to his farm and to other than others merchandise can you imagine this man would rather walk up and hug Bessie and kiss Bessie and say I love you cow and you're such a sweet cow they'd rather love and hug on their animals than they love and hug Jesus Christ and go to the house of God can you imagine that that seems insane they'd rather go play with their chickens you know then go to the Kings house for the marriage of his son well a lot of people doing today chase around some cats out there on the streets write some sexy dress cats you understand what I'm saying beetles and girls will chase the Beatles and the modern-day Beatles whatever you want to call them I don't know what they're called today hipsters I don't know what they're called but they'd rather chase animals and beastly people that go to the marriage of God's son amen they make light of it well I've might have next year I can do it when I get older or they went to the merchandise I'd rather have the new iPhone I rather spend my money on that and paid my tithes and offerings no they want merchandise I'd rather have this their houses or lands or what do you name it you name it I'd rather have this than have time with the king in his son that's right Church now go down to verse 8 then saith he to his servants the wedding is ready but they which were bidden were not worthy so again I don't want to be worthy for the wedding you must then come to the wedding you must come you must leave everything else and come to Christ wedding hallelujah worthy this is worthy and then look down in verse 11 once you get there you got to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen this is God's requirement for our day first you got to leave everything forsake everything then you got to come then you got to put on God's garment as well hallelujah verse 11 and when the king came in to see the guests he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment so once you get to God's house then you got to put on the word that's being preached how many want to walk worthy of Christ there's more it's good to come it's good to come but now you got to put it on and what could we love so much that we would fall in love with something else and it could get all of our life what could we love so much more than God's love in Jesus Christ what could be so important like I was telling Benjamin just sitting yesterday I got a good fellowship this Christianity is based upon love that's all it's based upon right it's all based upon love love the Lord your God with all your heart soul mind and strength that's the greatest command love fall in love with this Savior fall in love with this provider fall in love with this healer amen fall in love with this Lord of lords and King of Kings amen fall in love with this risen Christ amen why can't people fall in love with I don't know because they love the things of the world too much they're living from the flesh instead of living from the inside it's exactly right that makes somebody unworthy of the wedding there's my hour so give me just five minutes let me set another timer here Jesus said you must be worthy of that world let's read that Luke 2035 we must be worthy you must be honorable to make it to that world Luke 2035 2035 I think this might be a parallel passage it's one we read earlier I think but I'm not sure Luke 2035 to be worthy of the gospel of Jesus Christ I want him to be first on him to have all my love on him to have all my allegiance I want to bear his cross as hard as it gets sometimes I want to bear his cross 20:35 but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage again to be in that first resurrection you must live a worthy life a respectful of now for God to respect your life you must live a worthy respectable life that God can respect praise God alright I'm gonna skip past that I'm not gonna read that let me just do a couple more scriptures I have another scripture here I want to read I got about three four more thoughts I just want to share before we close I've been saying it over and over again but the only way were worthy is if God says we're worthy and the way we get God to say we're worthy is to keep his commands it is that simple that simple let's go - oh my ba just let me just read them and just share some thoughts here's because I stand on our feet I'm gonna close it is God Himself who can call us worthy but God knew what was behind that we must have faith the Bible said we must receive the end of our faith right we can start out but we must receive the end of it it must last other words all the way to the end in this story in Zechariah remember in Zechariah Joshua the high bridge this is in Joshua with Moses it's a different Joshua hundreds of years later Joshua the high priest has brought dirty garments remember that story and a voice said take away his filthy garments and clothe him with clean garments remember that it's in the Zechariah 3 form and he answered and spake unto those that sit before him saying take away the filthy garments from him and I'm saying hey we said behold I have caused I iniquity the bastard thee and I will clothe thee with change of raiment what is the iniquity iniquity is knowing what's right and doing what's wrong anyway it's called a transgression so God was saying Joshua was repenting take away all his iniquities and clothe him with righteousness thank you don't worry what am I saying if we come to God repenting and really repent and really love God and really for surrender all things Jesus will take away all of our iniquities and we'll know they're gone how many know how many know there's some iniquities you used to do but you know they're gone now anybody say been to that today Lori thank you Jesus amen he said take I'm gonna cause your iniquity to pass away and I'm gonna close you in righteousness it's not gonna say give me that righteousness let me try that it's you the best thing it and letting Christ say okay take it away he's worthy the only way to be worthy is to meet God's requirements remember god I've got a joven set this man is perfect why oh because all he did was sacrifice animals that was all God required in that day offer sacrifices offer sacrifices that God looked out and said he's perfect and the same thing today cause if you have enough Sun all the other dude is offering the sacrifice of repentance offer the sacrifice of praise give our lives as an offering for Jesus Christ make yourselves a living sacrifice and God look down no matter what your struggles are you look down and he'll know that you're serving your whole life it'll say Anna Rico is perfect they met I was like Jesse Smith is perfect by the blood of Christ amen but he's the one Christ is the one who must say you're worthy that's the only way we can be where you meet is humble and member simple requirements the Bible said the way of holiness is so a fool won't miss it it's so simple to keep the Word of God and let me say this my last thing or is there another idea other than job is the pass over of the death age I remember that from the sexes chapter 12 how will the death angel pass over you and I today if the blood is applied all you have to do is to meet the requirements all I had to do is kill and take that catch that blood in the bowl and put it on their house all you got to do is recognize that Jesus was killed for you right confess and get rid of all the love of the world and let him put his blood all over yourself I thought you have to do lay here until he puts his blood on your soul so you don't want nothing more to do with the world that's all you have to do is follow with the one who died for you amen that's all you have to do and then you've passed from death unto life and now you're excited you're worthy not because of anything else but yes you've met my requirements and they're so simple who won't miss it it's the same thing we meet God's requirements and he makes us worthy and the reason unless unless thing the reason that he does this the reason he can say you're worthy is because remember he said you were chosen in Christ before the foundation anyone so now I am zooming back out for that now I happen to be back out to the sovereignty of God the reason he ultimately could call you worthy it's because he foreknew you because you were in his mind and you were part of him you know God said a mother can forsake her sucking baby remember that scripture said that a mother could actually forsake and leave her baby and forget about it they do it all the time because washing clanks are they gonna adoption inductions million times better and that's good I'm glad they adopted let the baby be adopted but if a mother God said a mother can be baby said but I can never forget you so God's unity to his people God's unity to us is white it's so special it's greater than even a mother to child that's why he can call you worthy because really you're a part of him amen let's bow our heads and word of Prayer heavenly father we're thankful for the word we've heard tonight Lord God when I read these scriptures I was so stirred up because you plainly lay out what we must do to meet your requirements to be called worthy ultimately we know Lord all of those who keep those requirements were already known in your mind were chosen in Christ but Lord here on earth we don't have that knowledge necessarily of what happened and and exactly what took place before the foundational world so Laura down here we have to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling help us the fear and help us to tremble to work we're gonna help us Heavenly Father we want to be on the worthy side there's only two areas to be found either were worthy and in honor you and we and we love you and then you will walk with you and you off with us or we'll be unworthy of the gospel wow that we want to be worthy to God we want to be worthy of this glorious gospel Lord God we thank you Lord for the Word of God and thank you for the songs we've heard Lord Jesus father if there's any other needs I hear you meet them Lord God and I prayed that people would go Lord to their homes tonight worshiping you Lord God loving you and rejoicing that we can be worthy to suffer for me we can be worthy and you'll call us worthy because God says I'm worthy God is the one who says I'm righteous not because of necessarily what I've done I've just humbled myself to His commandments and then the worthy one judges me as worthy what a beautiful picture we have mode tonight of the worthy judge calling us the worthy ones we thank the Lord for the word that we've heard help us to search our hearts and souls here tonight for a few minutes because we want to love you we want to see you Lord and we want you to walk with us Lord God it would be such a privilege if we could walk with you Lord in the Millennium and the future home Lord come you're only going to walk with the worthy ones
