we'll just stand in honor of the word let's go to Exodus chapter 4 as we sent out on the postcard we'd like to preach on thus saith the Lord for today amen so let's look at it Exodus chapter 4 we will look at the stay at the Lord for the day of Moses and then we'll see how that applies to us today because it certainly does apply to us today in fact this is the first time in scripture that we ever read us say at the Lord so let's see what it meant here to Moses Exodus chapter 4 verse 19 and we'll go 19 to 23 and so I'll read 19 to 22 and then we can all read 23 together by God's grace so Exodus 4:19 says and the Lord said unto Moses in Midian go return into Egypt for all the men are dead which sought thy life and Moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon an ass and he returned to the land of Egypt and Moses took the rod of God in his hand and the Lord said unto Moses when thou goest to return into Egypt see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh to which I have put in thine hand but I will harden his heart that he shown let the people go now let's pay attention to verse 22 I'll read that still and thou shalt say on Pharaoh thus sayeth the Lord Israel my son even my firstborn let's all read verse 23 together one two three and I say unto thee let my son go that he may serve me and if thou refuse to let him go behold I will slay thy son even thy firstborn let's have one more word of Prayer let's just bow our heads father we love you today dear God we thank you for your mercy your son Jesus Christ father just bless our our ministry today bless our gathering with thy divine presence Lord God bless every heart and soul that's here those livestreaming those that are hungry to hear thus saith the Lord for today just take control of me and could take control of every heart Lord that we could all hear the Word of God in Jesus Christ's name every said amen god bless you being seated praise the Lord so Malachi can switch over when you're ready thank you sir I'll try to keep this within 45 minutes so let me set a timer here so I do try to keep my word here by God's grace so we like to welcome everyone here to our little summer Series in July and we'll be teaching the foundations of the Christian faith because there's only one faith amen so some of you may know we sent out 2,500 postcards to this this zip zip code right here around the church here so those that are right close to the church and we're gonna take this month and focus on what the Holy Spirit or the pillar of fire has spoken to this generation we're so glad that else was able to attend this wonderful she could make it by God's grace and each Sunday we'll be looking at a different topic today where I look at some of the thus saith the Lord statements for today next Sunday we'll look at prophecy we'll look at future thus saith the Lord that God has spoken that are going to come to pass in two weeks we'll look at the power of the name of Jesus Christ in Baptism in miracles in the Godhead we'll look at that name that special name of the Lord Jesus Christ three weeks we'll look at the 12 New Testament mysteries and then the last week we'll look at the book of Revelation revealed will show as many symbols as we can in the 45-minute session so people can understand what the book of Revelation is all about so let's look at this thought here we read our text in Ephesians 4 I'm sorry I'm sorry it's not Ephesians Exodus 4 and and I'm just gonna use a few pictures and slides here so we learned from verse 22 that God told Moses to speak for him and when Moses was speaking God's words he would literally say thus saith the Lord because that's what he said God said you shall say unto Pharaoh thus saith the Lord and remember in Deuteronomy 18 Moses was called a prophet because that's what a prophet is a prophet is one who speaks for the Lord and when a prophet says thus say at the Lord that means God told them to say that and they're being obedient saying what God said because God Moses told the people that God would raise him up a prophet and put my words or put God's words in his mouth so this is gives us a little bit of a background humming Oh Joshua was a prophet Joshua said thus saith the Lord there is an accursed thing in the midst of thee so Joshua was also a prophet he was a spokesperson for God people might not be aware of that but whenever God wanted to say something and let them know that it was him talking he would say first thus saith the Lord and we know Sam you know this picture of Samuel and David but when Samuel says here was not to David of course this is what he told to Israel Samuel told Israel thus saith the lord you have rejected your God and chosen a king so now we see you know these three examples Moses Joshua and now Samuel all saying these important words thus say at the Lord and that was to let the people know that this is not an idea of a man this is just isn't Joshua's opinion or Samuel or Moses opinion but it's actually God's own word this is a positive thus saith the Lord statements we've already read a few that are kind of like judgments right that are God judging the people but here's a really encouraging positive thus say at the Lord statement this is Isaiah Isaiah said thus saith the Lord I lay in Zion or is Jerusalem a precious cornerstone that's in first samuel 10 II I'm sorry that's not first a meal that's uh isaiah 28:16 i'm sorry i forgot to change this right here that should be isaiah 28:16 forgive me but we all know that Peter quoted what Isaiah said and Peter said Isaiah was talking about Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ is the foundational stone he's the cornerstone he's our sure foundation so again we have isaiah saying thus saith the lord and this is a positive promise and God did what he said he sent Jesus Christ and now Christ is the cornerstone of your faith aren't you glad that your faith is built upon the cornerstone of Jesus Christ amen he is the cornerstone of my faith in your faith here's another example I love this picture of Jeremiah Jeremiah spoke with thus saith the Lord did you know he used thus saith the Lord 147 times Jeremiah said thus saith the Lord so God was in constant contact with Jeremiah the Prophet and look what he said he said thus saith the Lord I will make my words in thy mouth fire and this people would so this was another kind of a time of judgment right God was going to judge Israel and so the word of Jeremiah would be thus saith the Lord it'd be like fire and it would consume or burn the people up now how many how many know did the people receive Jeremiah or the rejected they rejected him they didn't now people did not repent in the days of Zedekiah they did not repent and that's why God said the people are gonna be like wood but your word which would be thus saith the Lord is going to be like fire to them so thus saith the Lord is a very powerful statement I hope everybody can see that I could have went further Ezekiel said the second-most thus say at the Lord's he said 126 thus say at the Lord's so the phrase thus saith the Lord is very critical to understanding how God speaks to his people when God speaks to his people through a prophet he uses those words thus saith the Lord now now that you understand what a prophet does they speak for God now you can begin to understand today's sermon why I called it thus saith the Lord for today I'm going to share what God has spoken today with thus saith the Lord through a prophet most people are probably not aware that God has spoken with us saith the Lord as I was not aware until I was 21 years old I had no idea God even spoke with us say the Lord anymore - I was 21 years old and I heard the message similar to what we're about to hear right now but we're very thankful God has spoken with us say at the Lord today now as you probably noticed on the front of the postcard I sent out or those of you who are live streaming and saw my facebook post about this you probably see a man here on the right-hand side and that name is the name of that man is William Branham and we believe he was God's prophet for this last day this last day generation he passed away in 1965 of course he there's his age right there from 1909 to 1965 and there were over 60 times that I counted that I found where he spoke to the listeners of the Christians using the phrase thus say at the Lord as it applied to truce from the Bible and so we're gonna share about 10 or 15 of those I probably can't get to all of them because there's just not enough time it would take hours and hours and hours so I'll be sharing some of those now if you notice the words the pillar if I wrote the words pillar of fire on here because of the next picture I'm gonna show it's gonna come up next and I don't know Alice have you seen this picture here that comes up right here have you seen this picture before okay wonderful amen wonderful so this picture of course is a picture of William Branham with the pillar of fire okay and here's a little bit more info about that the picture was taken in 1950 in Houston the Houston Coliseum in Texas now that cow scene was now torn down and they got a bigger one bill but in 1950 this picture was taken and we believe this is the same pillar of fire that led Moses all the days of his life and helped lead Israel out of Egypt we also believe this is the same pillar of fire Paul met on the road to Damascus where a light struck him knocked him off his horse and he said who is it Lord and he said I am Jesus so we believe that this same pillar of fire that was with Moses that spoke to Paul is the same pillar of fire that was with brother Branham and I think after listening and watching some of the videos and hearing some of the things I'm going to share I think you'll agree that God was with this wonderful man of God because you'll see supernatural vindications and you'll see that his Bible teaching was pure it was the same teaching that Paul taught brother Branham always stayed with the Bible and so that's why I put on that postcard that's why I put on the postcard the pillar of fire has spoken this generation because it wasn't brother branham's ideas he was just reap reaching everything that the Apostle Paul had already preached but most of it had been lost where we to churches and we wouldn't hear much of what the Bible says you wouldn't hear preached but God wanted to bring him back God wanted to restore it and he did it by His Holy Spirit or what we call the pillar of fire so we're so grateful God has spoken to this generation with the pillar fire amen now just so everyone knows - in 1950 after this picture was taken brother branham's friends had a man examine the picture they examined the negative of it and a man named George J lacy examined it in 1950 and this is the actual document and I can print off a copy if you'd like a copy he examined it and his opinion is at the bottom he said further I am the definite opinion that the light struck I'm sorry the light streak appearing above the head in a halo position was caused by light striking the negative in other words he was saying this picture was not doctored this picture was not a phony this is a legitimate picture of God and so if you you can research George de Lacy online of course he's passed away now but he was the president of the American Society for questioned documents and examiner's because after brother Branham and his friends saw this picture they said well is this God or what is this they believed it was God so they sent it out to the most advanced examiner they knew for documents and he did all the tests you could if you want to read through here here's the examination there's there's five paragraphs on the test that they did to make sure that this was not a phony picture and the results came back that it was a legitimate picture of the pillar of fire so as far as we know this is the first time gods ever been photographed and God chose to take a photograph with his prophet now doesn't that sound like Moses God identified his prophet with the pillar fire and that's what we see today God identifying in other words God showing to everybody here's the man I'm gonna speak through and we all need to listen to what he says when he says thus saith the Lord all right so hope that's helpful by God's grace I think that's a beautiful testimony of how how official it is that God has spoken to this generation so let's let's say that photo is legitimate which we believe it is but some people you know might not but let's say let's say it was were there any other supernatural signs that might let us know that brother Branham was a prophet of God and I would say yes there are many supernatural signs I think I'll share too because of time let me share too and I'm gonna show a video next okay so Malachi do you have the remote we may have to turn it up just a little bit we'll see I tested it after first service I want to show you a testimony of a congressman William Upshaw who was healed he was he was paralyzed in a wheelchair and he served in Congress for eight years he went to a meeting a brother branham of course where we know the pillar of fire was leading brother Branham and God spoke to brother Branham to speak to him and it raised his faith and he was healed and he got up out of his wheelchair and he spent the last few years of his life completely healed by the grace of God so let's watch a quick video on that and then we will move on to the next thought but I want to share that testimony with you I may have to rewind this the following has been written set up brother Brandon the ending of world war two marked the beginning of a phenomenal growth period for the Pentecostal people around the world it was perhaps the greatest healing revival ever witnessed in the history of the world the person universally acknowledged as the revivals father and peace center was William Brandon the sudden appearance of his miraculous healing campaigns in 1946 set off a spiritual explosion in the Pentecostal movement which was to move to Main Street USA by the 1950s and give birth to the broader charismatic movement in the 1960s which currently every denomination in the country now I want to quickly point out this is not brother branham saying this about himself but these are historians who wrote about this in the dictionary of Pentecostal and charismatic movements so these historians have recognized the person who was known to start this revival of healing was William Branham and if you know history the the person who always starts the move was usually the one who is led of God and then Satan comes after God does something and tries to pervert the move and try to deceive people but it's just like in the days of Moses Moses didn't copy anybody Moses was the starter of the move of God and so was William Branham he started the move of God amen now here next we have a testimony of William Upshaw and you can even hear his voice from 1951 international it's February 1961 issue wrote in Bible days there were men of God who were prophets and seers but in all the sacred records none of these have a greater ministry than that of William Brandt a prophet and seer of God brandon has been used by God in the name of Jesus to raise the dead the late worldwide evangelist Tommy Osborne has said William Branham came our way as a prophet of God and showed us in the 20th century precisely the same things that were shown us in the Gospels so now we have a few more witnesses of prominent worldwide evangelist like Tommy Osbourne and this the voice of healing editors they were right they were witnessing all the healings and miracles in those days and they recognized that of all the gifts that God had given to these men to do divine healing William branham's gift surpassed all of them and he had the most we'd say the most anointing he was closest to the scripture he was the one God was using in the most spectacular ways and now I believe it's the testimony of congressman Upshaw so forgive me the Holy Spirit vindicated the ministry william branham time and time again by infallible proofs such as the morality of the United States congressman we in the up draw at the age of 84 after 66 years of being a paraplegic while bound to a wheelchair and crutches the congressman who served eight years in Congress from 1919 to 1927 groaning widely dispersed pamphlet that you can download and enjoy today that detailed the miraculous presence of the Holy Spirit that came down and healed him during a healing campaign of brother Branham and earned Baxter so I'll pause that right there here's a picture of congressman Upshaw one of brother branham's meetings look at all those people because in those days God was moving in a tremendous way in divine healing and so it attracted thousands and thousands of people so he was in a wheelchair for 66 years he came to a Branham meeting and then now and then he got healed and he stood up and then he wrote an article about it and sent it out to everybody he knew then the Lord said William Branham earned Baxter either side with their ministry of healing in Calvary's criticism time man then suddenly Calvary temple was lit with heavens flame I threw away my crutches and walked in Christ dear name yesterday today forever Christ they got the same my Savior and my healer oh praise His Majesty halls are right there that's the actual voice of William Upshaw after he's healed he preaches three or four times a day and he's 84 years old if God healed you after 66 years you'd probably do the same once yeah for the brothers and the sisters you witness and testify and this is brother Branham and William Upshaw talking in 1951 this is a United States congressman so that means the power of God was known in the White House back then amen [Music] [Music] praise the Lord let's give that round Baz amen so this nation you know cannot say that God has not spoken to it because God reached all the way to the white house and God showed his supernatural power all the way there to Congress now here's the next testimony I want to share in 2010 I met a woman by the name of sister Humes I forget personai but anyways I met her in 2010 she was an older woman at that time since a few years ago she went home to be with the Lord she passed away but when I was there I preached and she came up to me afterwards she was pushing her husband in the wheelchair and she said brother Jessie she said you preach exactly what brother Branham preached and that made me feel real good because that's what I want to preach I want to preach the Bible because I know brother Branham preached the Bible it was quite humbling and sister Humes here's a picture of her she went to Branham tabernacle from around 1960 to 1965 until the time brother Branham passed away and the testimony behind her is that she was dying of tuberculosis in 1955 so four years after that recording we just heard with William Upshaw she was dying of tuberculosis had no children and her husband was all you know flustered upset well she went to a meeting of William Branham and she got in the prayer line and she got to stand right in front of brother Branham and here's what brother Branham said to her now I didn't have time to put the the audio on here but I could get it for you food listen to it her brother Graham said you're thin lady and tired night sweats no one has to tell you what it is you know that the doctor can't do it but that's the first disease that Jesus cured you believe that don't you I TB or tuberculosis is no more to him he can just make you well in a moment do you believe it come forward and then he lays his hands on sister Humes almighty god the omnipotent God omniscient the resurrected Lord Jesus this poor little woman standing here dying Lord Satan as did this evil and she's trying and I take charge over him so over Satan through the authority of the Bible and through God's Eternal Word and I condemn Satan in Jesus Christ name turn the woman loose and may she go and be made well amen now this is the main part of her testimony because brother Graham said god bless you sister tell you what to do whether I told you the truth or not so maybe she was struggling with am I gonna be healed or not brother Branham said you go Monday and weh-weh yourself on a scale then next Monday way again see what I've told you amen and sister Humes testimony was at that next Monday she went weighed herself she was one pound more and with tuberculosis you don't gain weight you just lose weight she said the next Monday she was another pound heavier and it just kept going until she was back to her full weight and she had numerous children after that this is one of her sons he's the pastor in North Carolina I just preached for him back in December and January his name is Tim Humes and then he's had children and a grandchildren and so God through the prayer William Branham healed this woman and now this woman has a great legacy her children and children's children are serving the Lord so I thought that would be a great encouragement to know that I've met people who were healed in the meetings of brother Branham so I'm a I'm a second hand of witness of what God did in those meetings because I'm too young to be a first hand but this man will tell you the testimony if you'd like to talk to him have his phone number if you'd like to contact him a true man of God in fact when we were down there they were just worshipping and thanking God three people were healed of cancer in the last month of their last month of their church three people have been healed of cancer so our God is the greatest God he's the only God he's the only living God and his name is Jesus Christ and so we're so thankful to know that God moved through William Branham and he's still moving today because Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever so that's a another testimony so if the photo was legitimate and all these testimonies are legitimate then how else do we know he was a genuine prophet well here's here's one thought on it the Bible says this the Bible says in Deuteronomy 18 if you say in your heart how should we know the word which the prop which the Lord hath not spoken okay so Moses told the people this is how you know if God did not send this person as a prophet when a prophet speaks in the name of the Lord if the thing follow not nor come to pass that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken but the prophet has spoken it presumptuously thou shalt not be afraid of him so this is how you measure a prophet if he says thus say at the Lord and it comes to pass then you know it was God and I have a few examples here there's video on our website - I did a video on three of brother branham's prophecies that we can clearly say have come to pass or are in the process of coming to pass in other words they have stood true since the moment he said them so we're gonna watch a video on these three if you want to write them down you can the first one is the one that we know without a shadow of a doubt has been fulfilled brother Branham prophesied that the Churches of the United States would get more and more immoral he said he saw a vision and I'll you'll listen to a little bit he saw a vision he said this is thus saith the Lord about the churches in America so we know that has literally come to pass the two that are in the process of coming to pass are the last two that I put up here number two and three there will be no greater ministry to the Gentiles than the ministry that God gave to William Branham now he didn't say that in Pride but he just said it in the truth that it was it was just true his gift which we're gonna see also in a few moments was the the greatest gift the Gentile people would ever see and I think you'll agree after watching it there could be no greater gift than what God gave to William Branham because it was Jesus is it was Jesus's gift in William branham's life and the third prophecy that is still standing today is that brother Branham said thus saith the Lord no denomination will return to the original Bible faith and that that prophecy is still standing today and so we're thankful for those three and member this is how we know if he was a prophet if if he said thus saith the Lord and it came to pass or it's in the process of coming to pass then we know he's a true man of God but if any of these would have failed then we would know he was not a true man of God so we know he's a true man of God amen so let's watch this video this video is going to be a little bit longer and we're gonna look at how these three prophecies are fulfilled or in the process of being fulfilled and I'll probably stop at a few points and make a few points that I want to make by God's grace whoops bear with me alright so here's the next one now I may have to take it back and may need to rewind sorry let me pause that go back here I skipped a little bit and in reality at that time history says that rock and roll itself and musicians like Elvis Presley were denounced by most clergy members but William Branham was given a vision that predicted the churches would soon embrace rock and roll and other worldly practices let's listen to the so this is the actual voice of brother Branham prophesying in 1965 brother Graham sees a vision what does the church United States gonna look like in the future and he says it's thus saith the Lord so now he's speaking like Moses spoke right now he's speaking like Ezekiel and Jeremiah and Samuel he's speaking as a prophet you turn it up a little bit just the twisting walk to rock'n'roll and I said is that the Church of the United States okay so hope everybody could understand that he sees the vision of what what is Miss USA what is the churches of USA going to be about toward the end time and they're going to be immorally dressed they're not going to be dressed in covering up their bodies the way they should they're gonna be addicted to smoking and and they're going to be they're going to love rock and roll right and then he says that's the stay at the Lord that's the vision the Lord showed me the immoral condition today's United States urges would be in and correctly prophesied of what God showed him in many churches today their worship services closely resemble a rock and roll concert due to the popularity and influence of the lucrative business of Christian contemporary music along with that many church members enjoy listening to rock and roll music and do not see it as a sinful act anymore although used to be considered sinful many church members see no problem single on and dancing to worldly rock and roll in their homes cars at weddings restaurants and other social gatherings prophecy number two to the greater ministry to the Gentiles meaning William branham's ministry from Jesus Christ would be the last signs of the Gentile people before the second coming of Jesus Christ now let me pause this this is very in critical that we watch this watch the Ministry of William Branham and I'll just summarize it brother branham would have sick people or people that need a prayer come up to him and as he was talking to them God would show him visions and then he would tell each person the secrets of their heart and it never failed it was always thus saith the Lord and I'm gonna show you one case where he showed a woman 15 things 15 secrets about her life now only Jesus Christ could do that nobody here could do that I can't do that no one can do that it had to bend Jesus Christ that's why we say his gift was the greatest possible gift you could have because it was Jesus Christ showing him a vision showing him all the secrets and then knowing things that no man can know only God could do that and that's why we say it is the greatest gift and the the last I'm sorry the greatest ministry before the rapture before the time of the Gentiles is over fifty years ago William Branham repeatedly prophesied that no ministry would arise to the Gentiles which are non-jews that would be greater than the ministry that Jesus Christ gave to him we REM said that God told him his ministry was the last sign and the greatest sign to the Gentiles before the second coming of Jesus Christ he also told us that the next great ministry on the earth after his would be that of the two Jewish prophets of Revelation chapter 11 the Bible plainly shows that were in the last day [Music] I'm fairly young yet I'm 53 years old [Music] what mean William Rand is minister he's so unique why would the Spirit of God make such a bold claim we didn't read him had a prophetic gift of discernment that could tell people that our thoughts and secrets of their hearts William Rand his prophetic gift was the fulfillment of Luke 17 30 the revealing of this the man to the Gentiles this prophetic gift was simply the return of the same gift that the Lord Jesus himself exercised in Saint John chapter 1 with Peter Nathanael and in Saint John chapter 4 with the Samaritan woman at the well immediately after the Samaritan woman's simple secret of having six men in our life was revealed by Jesus prophetic gift she knew the gift of a prophet was present with her where she said sir I perceived a tower to prophet in Saint John 4:19 later in verse 29 she said common see a man which told me all the things I ever did is not this the Christ now let's watch as God lets William Branham manifest the same prophetic gift a discernment that Jesus did this son of man and gift in his life were revealed 15 secrets to a patient in this particular parent line from 1954 so now we're gonna watch as brother Branham does the same thing Jesus Christ it because it was Jesus Christ taking over brother branham's body and that's all a gift is a gift is when the Holy Spirit takes over you and I and then God does what he wants to do so brother Branham gets no praise brother Branham gets no thanks all the glory goes to Jesus but remember the Holy Spirit said thus saith the Lord there will be no greater sign than this given to the Gentiles so this must be an amazing powerful gift and 15 secrets he tells to one woman your window he just told her what ten things that were true one after another because he's seeing in a vision just like Jesus saw the visions because Jesus said I do nothing except the father show me first so everything Jesus did the father showed him in a vision and then he would go do it and this is the same thing Jesus is doing the brother branham he's showing him visions and then letting the people know that God knows their hearts and lifes and God wants to heal them this is powerful he goes he sees more vision he tells her her name what city she lives in and her address and then he says you're going home to be well only Jesus Christ could do that remember this is a very similar thing to what he did to my well the my acquaintance that I met mrs. Hulme sister Humes the very same thing he said if you're not sure go measure yourself on Monday and then the Monday after he saw on a vision if she goes and measures herself she's gonna start gaining weight and she's gonna be healed so this is the this is the gift of a prophet the gift of a seer someone who knows the will of God [Music] thank you Jesus he's God the reason we believe this last sign prophecy is in the process of being fulfilled over fifty years later is because no preacher has ever manifested the power of Jesus Christ on or near the same level as the ministry that God gave to William Branham churches today have grown in attendance and finances and preachers have written more books and had worldwide television ministries but no gift has ever risen that compares to the prophetic son of man gift that God gave to William Branham where's the gifted man that can tell strangers their name their address their sickness and many other details of their lives by receiving visions from Jesus Christ we have not seen a man do this infallibly since William Branham ministered to God's people all right I'll pause right there okay there's a little more on congressman Upshaw but I hope everybody saw it by God's grace that this gift was so powerful it packed out stadiums this was such a powerful gift the reason it was rejected is because the message that came after it brother Branham would preach and he would pray for the sick people would be healed but then when brother Branham started preaching what the Bible says people didn't like it anymore and that just proves he was a true prophet of God but this gift in his life was a true gift of God it was a prophet gift a discernment gift and no gift has ever risen that's greater than this gift can anybody raise your hand tell me a greater gift on TV or has anyone ever seen a greater gift on a preacher than this I was I hear is cricket's of course not no no one has ever seen anything as close to this where it would tell them thoughts and in secrets of their heart and tell them parts of their lives that no one else would know no no one has even seen a gift close to this so that's why we know no greater gift will no greater ministry will rise before the rapture that's thus saith the Lord so we have confidence in that because that's what God told His Prophet to say now here's a little more on I may skip past this because we already watched the part on when Upshaw earlier further okay so here's the last one no return of Christian denominations to the pure teaching of the Bible in 1965 william prophesied the denominational churches would never break up their denominations and come back to preaching and living the true Word of God their worship would not resemble the book of Acts church which had supernatural power gives to the spirit the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Christian Holiness the reason we know this prophecy is in the process of coming to pass is because in the past 49 years all denominations whether Catholic or Protestant have failed to break up their denominations and denounced their man-made bylaws and traditions of men most of nominations have little to no religion that resembles the true church in the book of Acts and the signs that Jesus said would follow true believers in mark chapter 16 such as speaking in tongues healing the sick and casting out Devils all of these are missing from many congregations all right let's give that round pause amen amen all right so we'll keep going here by the grace of the Lord I hope that's three powerful vindications like I showed there there's three powerful times that God had his prophets say thus saith the Lord and it's either come to pass this has clearly come to pass my mom was raised in church and she never saw rock-and-roll coming to the church into the last 15 or 20 years so brother Branham saw that fifty years in advance and he prophesied of it and said thus saith the Lord rock and roll's come into the churches and it has come so we know it's coming to pass also we've never seen a greater ministry than that of brother Branham and no denomination whether Baptist or Protestant or Catholic no denomination has ever broken up and say you know we're gonna we're gonna forsake all of our traditions we just want to believe the they've never done it and they can't because it's thus saith the Lord all right now let's keep moving here by God's grace so why did we need thus sayeth the Lord I have some scriptures here because Paul said evil men and seducers are gonna wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived we needed someone to come and say thus saith the Lord because there's so many men out there tricking people especially when it comes to the Bible and that's what Paul said this was 2,000 years ago Jesus said the same thing jesus said something very similar he said go into the strait gate why does the gate broad is the way that leads to destruction many there be which go in thereat because Strait is the gate narrows the way which leadeth unto life and look at this this is reality few there be that find it Jesus Christ Himself said few people will be saved and yet we have more churches today than we've ever had and yet Jesus said fewer people will be saved and there's gonna be more deception in the end time that's why we needed thus saith the Lord praise the Lord and Paul said even more about these last days Paul said in the last days perilous times will come for men should be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful and unholy and the Bible said they'll be lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God on this next slide here and this is where we're at today people say they love God but their lives show that they love sin more than they actually love God and this is the condition that we live in so of course God would have to send somebody to the earth and give them thus saith the Lord to speak to his people and to get them on the straight in there aren't you glad to be on the straight and narrow hey man I'm so thankful that God has sent us thus saith the Lord and we need thus saith the Lord because the Bible said Satan was going to deceive the whole world like Paul said already the Bible said the devil Satan deceives the whole world so that means every nation is going to be to see except for a very few small group of people the Bible also said Satan is the god of this evil age in 2nd Corinthians 4 3 so really he's the one that's getting most of the worship is Satan because they're not worshiping God according to the Bible amen and that paints quite a picture that most people think they're saved when they're not because it's deception they've been deceived into thinking they are saved so God had to send us thus saith the Lord and remember this - we needed the stay at the Lord because the Beast which is the Antichrist spirit is going to cause everyone small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads there's coming a great deception where it's going to be so tricky is this does God want us to take this mark or not and so God had to send thus saith the LORD so we know not to take of the mark of the beast it's gonna look good it's gonna look like it's the right thing but it's gonna be a lot it's gonna be a deception and so God had to send thus saith the LORD - tell us what the mark of the beast is and we'll get to that in a few moments now it's going to be so mark of the beast is gonna be so personal you and I or whoever it is maybe if we don't live to see it they're not gonna be able to buy or sell without taking the mark so Satan knows how to create a trap he's gonna make people choose the true faith over finances and most people are gonna choose finances over the true faith but we believe by God's grace we'll be out of here before that markets laid down because we see that that same pattern in the Holy Bible God always takes away his people before destruction so we always see that so which one would you choose hopefully you would choose the Word of God and believing the truth over finances amen that's what God wants you to choose praise God now despite the growing deception God promised to restore now I don't have the time because I told you I want to keep it short but these five scriptures if you want to write these down or I can give them to you afterwards if you put these five scriptures together you will see what God is doing right now God is sending us the God has sent us thus saith the Lord and we are receiving it living it and spreading it around the world that's what God is doing right now how many know that to be the truth it's totally in the Bible it's thoroughly taught through the scripture I don't have time because I don't want to wear you out tonight but here's a summary of what all these scriptures say Jesus will remain in heaven so he will not come until the hearts of the end time believers are restored to obedience through the revealed mysteries of the Bible that came by an Elijah anointed prophet so if you if you read those scriptures in your in your quiet time read those I can make copies everything if you read those you will see Jesus said Elijah must come and restore all things and Jesus will remain in heaven until everything is restored you will see that this had to happen and just so you know William Branham was that elijah anointed prophet amen and he revealed the mysteries of God which we'll be talking about on July 20 seconds on the back there will be showing those 12 New Testament mysteries by the grace of God okay so let me skip ahead here like I said I want to be mindful the time I don't want to wear you out so to summarize it again the the message of the hour so the thus saith the lord of the hour involves three r's and this is on the video - on our website but just to kind of shorten it God is revealing the word revealing the mysteries restoring our hearts back to the faith of the Apostolic fathers and then he's gonna rapture the Christians off the earth those are the three hours and I'll just say I could say it this - he's gonna reveal the Bible mysteries restore the hearts and then rapture the bride off the earth that is what God is doing right now and I'm thankful to be a part of it by God's grace so thankful now if Jesus does this if Jesus does these three hours then that would make himself the same yesterday today and forever how many want to serve a god the same God that was in the Bible that we read every day that's the kind of god I want to serve well that's what brother Banias ministry did it brought us the reality of Jesus Christ that Jesus Christ is here he's the same yesterday today and forever that's what the ministry was to do and that's what we're enjoying today by the grace of the Lord now next before I show some of these thus saith the Lord statements let me give a little bit of a warning here I just want to give a little bit of warning cuz some of these are very personal especially to our our live streamers anyone who would watch it before I say the thus saith the Lord's for today that brother Branham gave us you have to know they're out of the Bible everything he said that was thus saith the Lord you can find in the Bible okay but let me just give a little brief warning here before I read these the Word of God will reveal the heart conditions in other words when you read the Bible you disagree with something it shows your heart is not in the right condition but if you agree with God's Word then it shows your heart is getting into the right condition and anytime you read the Bible it reveals your heart condition because Jesus is the word of God the Word of God is Jesus's nature remember the scripture Simeon told Mary that Jesus would reveal the thoughts of many hearts so when Jesus came he was preaching preaching preaching because he was God's Word he was preaching and teaching and however they responded to it showed what was in their hearts so the Apostles they believed it showed so it showed they had good hearts but the Pharisees and Sadducees the Herodians who rejected it it showed their hearts were not right with God because they rejected the truth of God's Word and so the same is true today however we respond to thus saith the Lord straight out of the Bible it will reveal what's in our heart how many can say amen to that praise the Lord because remember the Word of God is like a sword it's not like a piece of cotton that's all soft it's like a sword it's gonna cut it's gonna hurt the human mind it's a discerner so it's a judge it's a judge of the thoughts and intents of the heart the Word of God is sharp a member of the Bible said Jesus was the word because the Bible said in the beginning was the word the Word was with God the Word was God and then the Word was made flesh so Jesus was the sword made into a human he was a walking around sword he was the Word of God and so whenever we show preach the Word of God it's a sword coming forth it's either gonna cut off if you let it it's gonna cut off the flesh or if not you're gonna be upset with it but we want to let the Word of God cut off any of our ideas and just have a circumcised heart like we said this morning and remember the Bible also said Jesus's name Jesus has a name another name and his name is the Word of God all right I'm trying to keep going here now here's what I mean to do our meaning to speak all these things in love so going to share some thus saith the Lord statements now they're very personal but they are straight from the Bible so I want to show these by the grace of the Lord so thus saith the Lord for today now I think this is I'm just gonna show that slide right there yeah yeah let me just show that one there and I'm gonna I didn't have time to get everything on here like I wanted to someone to read it off of a document here so we can know thus saith the Lord for today and again I'm saying this with all the the love and grace in my heart so the first one I think I chose about 15 here I'll try to be as brief as I can reading these by the grace of the Lord just a moment okay this one's not coming up so let me uh oh there's okay here we go yes sorry I tried to category categorize these in a way that you could understand it to hopefully it'd be pretty simple okay the first thus saith the Lord statement is hard for a lot of Patriots to hear but the prophet of God said thus saith the LORD the God that America claims to serve will destroy her that's hard to hear but God is going to destroy America for all of her sins and that's in Revelation chapter 13 we don't have time to go through all these but this is just to introduce you to the stay at the Lord for today now like this morning we should pray that things in the government change but ultimately we know what's going to happen America and every nation according to revelation is going to take the mark of the beast so we know there's no hope for national revival but we do want to see the individuals around the country that can be saved we do in a preach until all the individuals are saved but that's thus saith the Lord brother Branham said thus saith the Lord America will never rise again in the faith so America will never get back to being a Christian nation she'll never rise again spiritually she's gonna keep getting more and more defiled that's thus saith the Lord next if you have your Bible first Timothy 2:9 here's what brother Branham says let me read this it's straight out of the Bible and remember that's what the prophets did they came to emphasize God's Word 1st Timothy 2:9 let's read that if you got it you can write it down in like manner also that women adorn themselves in modest apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety so if you look at our women in here they're modestly dressed they're not showing off their bodies women today like to show off their their chests their behinds their legs their shoulders they like to show off everything but the Bible says we're not to do that were to be modestly dressed and so brother Branham said this with thus saith the Lord he says these women out here with little old tight dresses on and things like that men lusting after them they think they're decent he said you might not have done anything wrong physically but let me tell you something he says you're a tool for the devil and at the judgment bar thus saith the Lord you'll answer for committing adultery because you dressed immodestly and the church said Amen that is tough to hear for a lot of people but for someone who loves God and loves the Bible you could see how God wants us to cover our bodies so we don't cause others to stumble can everybody see that so he says thus saith the Lord we don't dress modestly will answer for at the day of judgment that sounds like all the prophets in the Old Testament as well sounds very familiar also here's another one that's important 1st Corinthians 11 where the Bible says that women should have short I'm sorry women should have long uncut hair or as long as they can grow and then men should have short hair 1st Corinthians 11 I know this is hard but you know when I first heard this my hair was long and my fiancee my wife Kristen at the time my fiancee her hair was little shorter she just got her hair cut but after we heard this cut my hair she let her hair grow out that's because we love the Bible because we believe God has truth in his Bible how many believe God's Bible is all truth amen so first Corinthians 11 now we don't have time to read the whole chapter but if you read the first sixteen verses you'll find that a woman was never supposed to cut her hair women are not supposed to cut their hair in fact you will never find one godly woman cutting her hair in the entire Bible huh me no that's the truth I challenge and I say that with the love of God in my heart I challenge everyone listening livestreaming go read your Bible search your Bible you'll never find a godly woman cutting her hair because they women were to have long hair because it represented they were under the full authority of their husband and men were always supposed to have short hair unless they were under a Nazarite vow but that was either for a lifetime or for just for a short season because the Bible says it's a shame for a man when he has long hair because he's looking like a woman it's a shame for a man to have long hair so let's just read that one so you know it actually let's read verse 6 for if the woman be not covered let her also be shorn but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven let her be covered now go down to verse 13 judging yourselves is it calmly that a woman pray unto God uncovered doth not nature even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it's a shame unto Him but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a clothes are covering and the church said now there you'll never find another scripture where Paul says well it's okay for the women in the Church of Philippians they can cut their hair you'll never find that in fact you'll find in 1st Corinthians 4:4 verse 17 every church was taught the same thing by the Apostle Paul Paul name never changed one thing he preached he preached the same thing to every church because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever now brother Branham says thus saith Lord I don't care how much a woman dances or sings or sings in the choir or speaks in tongues or runs up and down or has some type of Aid Societies if she cuts her hair she's dead he says which means not born again she's not born again if she cuts her hair because the Bible says it's a shame for her to cut her hair just like it's a shame for a man to have long hair all right I know that's very personal but we also know that's the Word of God and we want to let God in every personal area of our lives he created us we love Him we want him to have his way in our lives amen next go to first Timothy 2:12 let's go to this one this is a hard one for many people to hear but it's thus saith the Lord 1st Timothy 2:12 but I suffer not a woman to teach nor to assert or 'ti over the man but in the Beast I'm sorry but to be in silence for Adam was first formed then Eve so the lesson behind this is that women are not supposed to preach they can do any other gift they can cast out Devils they can speak in tongues they can prophesy they can do any other gift but they're not to be leaders behind the pulpit and brother Branham says this is thus saith the Lord he says she ain't got business over any authority in the church he says and after my going away from the earth he says many of you young children will find out in the days to come that this is exactly the truth because I speak it in the name of the Lord so this is thus saith the Lord women are not to preach men are supposed to preach but then we need men that have the Holy Ghost to preach and they're not there for a meal ticket right we need men that really preach the gospel because they love Jesus Christ amen just a few more can you bear with me a few more go to acts 2:38 let's go to acts 2:38 I'm trying not to got a little bit longer to go bear with me maybe hopefully 15 more minutes I've already gone longer than I thought but god bless you for your your patience everybody I didn't want to go too long acts 2:38 then Peter said to them repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost now in this statement brother Branham is saying to baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is the correct water baptism because that's what we see in the book of Acts I can show you five times when they baptized in the book of Acts that they use a literal name of Jesus Christ or the Lord Jesus Christ so brother Han tells us thus saith the Lord he said the baptism using the titles father son Holy Ghost is false thus saith the Lord I command every one of you here that hasn't been baptized name of Jesus Christ to be baptized again in the name of the Lord Jesus so we know that when Jesus said Father Son and Holy Ghost he wasn't giving the formula he was actually revealing the mystery that there's one name to God there's one name to the father son Holy Ghost that one name is the name above all names the name of Jesus Christ and if you study history knowing baptized father son Holy Ghost it's about 70 years after Jesus had already left because they didn't understand the revelation that there's one name for God amen which the Bible says in Zechariah there will be one God in his name one there's only one name for God and that's the Lord Jesus Christ okay oh my I'm just not gonna have a whole lot of time here let me let me just do let me do two more I promise you two more let me just do two more then we'll close with a few more scriptures the next one is revelation 17 so go to Revelation 17 17 verse 5 this is one of the most notorious women in the entire Bible this symbolic woman called Mystery Babylon brother branham tells us who she is she's a woman who looks like a Christian Church but she's not she's actually opposite of Christianity she's actually a deceptive Church and again I hate to say this but but I've got to tell the truth and I'm not against any person in these churches were against the system because it limits it changes the Word of God it perverts the Word of God but God is calling all of us people to come out false churches and come into the Word of God come into the truth come into a true church okay Rev revelation 17:5 and upon her forehead was a name written Mystery Babylon the Great the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth abominations our thing God hates in harlots of course are untrue women who sell themselves verse 6 and I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the Saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus and when I saw her I wondered with great admiration now if you read in verse 9 this woman sets on seven mountains which are seven hills let's all say it out loud who knows who's this church is the Roman Catholic Church the Roman Catholic Church so as hard as that is for me to say I have to say it this woman who's a deceptive church is the Roman Catholic Church I have friends that are Catholic and I love them but my desire is that they will come out of the Roman Catholic Church because Rome sits on seven hills anyone who reads history or geography knows that ancient Rome was established on Seven Hills and I have a video on our website that shows it shows 17 proofs that Mystery Babylon is the Roman Catholic Church because they exalt Mary above Jesus and they pray to Saints and Mary thinking that they're being heard when they cannot be because Jesus is the only mediator between God and man he's the only mediator the last one I'll do here before we finish up is the mark of the beast and brother told us marker than he said he said thus saith the Lord he said I know it's unpopular to speak against organization but that's the mark of the beast so the mark of the beast is organized religion like denominations or even non-denominational churches that adhere to false teachings all right so I know those are personal like I said I could have preached about 15 or 20 more but let's finish up here all right I read the best those are just a few thus say enough to kind of catch somebody's attention and all these things we've seen hope the hope that's enough to catch everybody's attention all right so what's this mean for you and I today what says thus saith the Lord mean for you and I today first it means we need to pray and listen to sermons and seek God to decide if this man was a true prophet or not because if he was true then God will require his words from us if he was false then we forgetting forget about him but if he's true God will require that we listen to when he said thus saith the Lord ii pray again listen to sermons again ask god again to help you live the original faith of the apostles we want to live the way they lived at the very beginning of the church in the book of Acts we want to be a book of Acts Church don't we amen we don't want just formal Creed's and traditions of men we want the Living Christ amongst us amen and also on my webpage here I've got over 50 videos that teach all these revelations that brother to us so you're more of course everyone's encouraged online go to that page pastor Jesse Smith and these are none of my teachings their Bible teachings that God gave to His Prophet and I'm just prophesying again what the prophets already said that's all I'm doing it's not my thoughts it's God's Word third listen and pray to the sermons again ask God to help you find a church that preaches the message of the hour the thus saith the Lord for today the revelation the restoration so you can be prepared for the rapture you can only live as high as the preaching that you hear before I heard this message I never could overcome pornography cussing addictions of drugs I could never overcome that but after I heard this message God has helped me overcome all of those because the Word was so much higher it gave me even more power because the word is power it will give you power to overcome all the sins of this world but we've got to fall in love with Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is the word the last call of the Holy Spirit is the Holy Spirit's calling come out of her this this woman come out of the Catholic Church come out of denominational churches come out of churches that are preaching false things come out of her that you be not partakers of her sins and her plagues and brothers and sisters I'm not proselyting I'm not saying join my church I'm saying you're welcome to come here we preach the truth we preach the message of the hour but go to a church that preaches the full gospel go to the church that believes Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and believes that the book of Acts is still going on today we are see where this is a kind of a touchy situation we're supposed to call them out of churches it looks like we're proselyting but we're not we're trying to get them washed in the blood of Jesus because to us it's not about numbers it's not about big buildings it's not about a bigger denomination it's about getting the people washed in the blood of Jesus and ready for the rapture that's what it's about how many believe that I'm almost done bear with me here I'm trying to go finish up yeah a few more because this is where you will get perfected the Bible says by five preaching gifts you will get perfected which means God will use their preaching to make you the best Christian you can be to fulfill all of God's Word for your life so you've got to come out of false churches and false doctrines and you've got to come into a church that believes the message of God the message of the hour amen and this is what we said earlier God gave space for the Roman Catholic Church to repent but she repented not so she gets cast into a bed with those that committed adultery and they get judged but remember the Bible also said that this woman has children which are all the churches that came after that stopped believing the move of the Holy Spirit it's not every Church but it's the majority of churches who do not let the Holy Spirit teach them all of the Word of God when they stop and say I can't learn anymore I don't want anymore of God I'm not hungry for money anymore of God they de nominate and the Holy Spirit leaves the church and God is calling all believers come out of those dead churches and come into a living Christ amen so what was Williams random mission let's stand here I'm gonna be done here I freeze a lot longer than I thought I preached a whole hour I wanted to do 45 minutes what was William branham's mission his mission was this he said not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church like I say I'm not I'm not asking you to follow him he would follow William Branham or anything like that or go to his home church or anything like that or start some fellowship or organization I've never done that and will not do that now I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God in people and if I can accomplish just one thing I'll be satisfied that one thing is to see establish a true spiritual relationship between God and man wherein men and women be can become new creatures in Christ Jesus fill with this holy spirit and live according to his word I would invite plead and warn all to hear his voice at this time and yield yourselves completely to him even as I trust in my heart that I've given him my all to him god bless you and may is coming rejoice your heart and that's from William Branham in 1965 let's just thank the Lord for that phrase God thank you lord see it's such a balance God is calling we saw in the Bible God is calling us out of dead churches and we've got to have a church somewhere but that's not the whole point of it just to join a church the whole point is to know Jesus Christ and him crucified and to let the spirit of Jesus Christ flow through you so much that you'll fall in love with every word that Jesus said and you will be an ambassador for Jesus Christ you'll be one telling people to come follow Jesus come hear the word it will transform your life you'll be a real Christian amen let's bow our heads here Malachi you come to the piano when you're ready sir I really appreciate you letting me go a little further I didn't mean to go so long I hope it was a blessing by the grace of God I'm so thankful and if you want to share this with anyone you know you can do that on your links I'm going to share it with some of our family members I've been talking with on Facebook there and trust that they will have a kind of an idea now hopefully they caught the whole hopefully the Holy Spirit was working on them and they were hearing the Holy Spirit by the grace of God I hope they heard what the Holy Spirit speaks as thus saith the Lord for today amen Heavenly Father we love you Lord God we thank you for the stay at the Lord I tried to summarize in about an hour thank you Lord for those who have heard it I appreciate their patience nor the people being patient with me ultimately Lord all's we want is to see us true spiritual relationship between God and man we are not proselyting we're not trying to just get a bigger church or get more money god that's the last thing on my heart and you're a witness Lord you know that I know that but yet Lord we know the scripture we've got to call people out of foster systems that do not believe all the Word of God we've got to call people to become perfected by the five fold ministry [Music] so father bless your people guide your people I pray for all those here physically Lord that your Holy Spirit would minister to them your word Lord no doubt cutting arts and maybe have the right response to the Word of God may we just love that word father for those listening uh pray God you spoke to their hearts Lord God I just had this burden to share what I believe Lord I felt this was the right time and we put many resources into it I just pray you'd give us some fruit Lord God and Lord it is enough Lord if just one soul gets to hear the thus saith the Lord for today it's worth it because before today they had not heard the say the Lord but now they have hallelujah and now your Holy Spirit's had a chance of our God to work upon that heart and to woo over that heart and try to get them to fall in love with you boy you get them to see the power of the Cross and the truth of the Bible to believe every word and God said for man should not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out the mouth of God thank you Lord Jesus Oh Lord we love you we worship You Lord Donny we give you all our logos as we close here Lord just speak to every heart bless every heart help us to love one another or take this word and do with it what you'd like we know your word will not return void may more
