[37:50] [Music]
[38:01] i like to get back to that series on the
[38:03] mystery
[38:04] of israel's blindness here let's look at
[38:06] that tonight
[38:14] so romans chapter 11 please
[38:28] romans 11 verse 1.
[38:44] so
[38:46] one is a beautiful scripture then we'll
[38:47] go down to verse 25 by the grace of god
[38:53] this is part of the saints i just got to
[38:54] switch out these batteries real quick
[38:56] i think they finally died after like
[38:57] three weeks they lasted a long time
[38:59] so whoever bought those batteries thank
[39:00] you those are like the the king of
[39:02] batteries right here
[39:07] i think they're called max what they
[39:09] call max or something
[39:13] so romans 11 1 and then romans 11 25.
[39:21] is that okay can you hear that now okay
[39:28] all right let's read verse one together
[39:31] romans 11 1. on three one
[39:34] two three i say then hath god
[39:38] cast away his people god forbid
[39:42] for i also am an israelite of the seed
[39:45] of abraham
[39:47] of the tribe of benjamin now go down to
[39:49] verse 25
[39:50] let's read that together
[39:59] all right let's read uh romans 11 25 on
[40:02] three one
[40:03] two three for i would not brethren that
[40:07] ye should be
[40:08] ignorant of this mystery lest ye should
[40:10] be wise
[40:11] in your own conceits that blindness in
[40:14] part
[40:15] is happened to israel until the fullness
[40:19] of the gentiles
[40:20] come in i'm sorry be coming thank you
[40:23] may god add his blessings to remus word
[40:24] you may be seated praise god
[40:27] so uh we started this series back on uh
[40:30] november 11th that was
[40:31] veterans day and we looked at uh the
[40:34] history of
[40:35] israel we started there at cain
[40:38] and abel and then seth and showed how
[40:41] god
[40:41] called israel made them a kingdom of
[40:44] priests unto god above all nations how
[40:47] many remember that
[40:48] that israel was above everyone else that
[40:50] shouldn't stumble us if we say
[40:52] the bride of jesus christ is dearly
[40:53] beloved above
[40:55] all churches right because a church is
[40:57] represented by a woman
[40:59] in scripture so that won't stumble us by
[41:02] god's grace
[41:04] so let's uh then we looked at uh the
[41:08] first
[41:08] uh the confusion is can they be saved
[41:11] can blinded jews be saved
[41:15] uh could could they be saved in jesus
[41:17] day
[41:18] paul's day and can they be saved today
[41:20] while blinded
[41:21] and the answer is yes because god keeps
[41:24] his covenant
[41:25] he still saves blinded jews as long as
[41:28] they
[41:29] keep god's covenant that he gave them
[41:31] the old testament
[41:33] because they follow the old testament
[41:34] commands and he promises
[41:36] them white robes of eternal life praise
[41:38] god
[41:39] which is the great revelation of the
[41:41] fifth seal which we'll be looking at
[41:42] here tonight
[41:43] by god's grace uh so we looked at
[41:47] i looked in the scripture i found six
[41:48] proofs that god can save
[41:51] blinded jews the first one was jesus
[41:54] praying on the cross
[41:55] father forgive them they don't know what
[41:58] they're doing
[41:59] now i hope you thought deeply about that
[42:02] statement that's quite a statement
[42:04] uh there were some people in the crowd
[42:05] that knew what they were doing when they
[42:07] were saying crucified crucified
[42:09] they hated the messiah they hated his
[42:12] power they hated his truth
[42:13] but there were some people in the crowd
[42:15] that were saying crucified crucified
[42:17] and they didn't know what they were
[42:19] doing because jesus said
[42:20] father forgive them they don't know what
[42:23] they do right
[42:24] but there was some that their names were
[42:27] getting blotted off
[42:28] the book of life when they were saying
[42:31] crucify him
[42:32] crucified him okay that was from psalms
[42:35] 69 i just want to refresh you on that
[42:37] one uh
[42:38] of course if uh if someone's listening
[42:40] and didn't get part one
[42:42] this is a crucial scripture for
[42:43] understanding this because we have to
[42:45] recognize in psalm 69
[42:48] verses 20 to 28 that god
[42:52] was pardoning some at the cross and then
[42:55] he was judging others at the cross
[42:57] it's a uh it kind of reminds us of the
[43:00] sheep and the ghost doesn't it
[43:01] right you have two groups you have some
[43:03] that are being pardoned uh
[43:04] uh they're gonna be saved right they're
[43:07] gonna be forgiven
[43:08] because jesus wouldn't lie if jesus says
[43:10] forgive them they're forgiven praise god
[43:14] can you imagine being forgiven and not
[43:16] even understanding what you're doing
[43:18] right i believe that's happening to some
[43:20] people today i believe there's some
[43:21] people that really love god
[43:23] but they're turning from the message and
[43:25] they don't know what they're doing
[43:27] they're leaving behind brother branham
[43:29] as a prophet they're leaving behind the
[43:30] message they're leaving behind us
[43:32] they're leaving behind other churches
[43:34] and they're not even aware of what
[43:36] they're doing
[43:37] because they've allowed some lie some
[43:39] root of bitterness or some
[43:41] uh they've allowed some stronghold to be
[43:44] built up
[43:44] in their mind they've given a place to
[43:46] the devil in their mind
[43:48] and now all they can think is evil
[43:50] thoughts about brother branham
[43:51] or all they can think is evil thoughts
[43:52] about you and i just because we believe
[43:54] god sent a prophet
[43:55] who was vindicated with many
[43:58] vindications praise god
[43:59] amen and i think the best vindication is
[44:02] the word of the lord
[44:03] the revelation of the holy spirit praise
[44:05] god because brother braham said the
[44:07] seven seals
[44:08] were his greatest meetings of any
[44:10] meetings amen
[44:12] he said better than any healing healing
[44:14] meetings better than
[44:15] the salvation meetings he said because
[44:17] this is revelation of truth praise god
[44:20] amen oh it makes me happy tonight praise
[44:22] god
[44:23] that god sent a prophet to finish the
[44:25] mysteries of god and gave him many
[44:27] vindications praise god
[44:29] he raised up a u.s senator praise god
[44:32] out of a wheelchair amen
[44:34] god took his picture with him with a
[44:35] pillar of fire in front of thousands of
[44:37] people in texas praise god this was no
[44:39] an ordinary man
[44:40] this was a prophet of god amen and yet
[44:43] some people
[44:44] brother jose can walk away they can they
[44:46] can believe it for a while but then they
[44:48] can walk away and
[44:50] i believe god is merciful to some of
[44:52] them that don't know what they're doing
[44:54] i believe god can still save them
[44:56] because i believe god is a god of mercy
[44:59] praise god
[45:00] and why would jesus say that why would
[45:02] jesus say father forgive them they don't
[45:04] know what they're doing
[45:05] still forgive them and that would only
[45:07] does that forgiveness only apply just at
[45:09] the cross
[45:10] or would it be god's way of mercy all
[45:12] throughout the plan of god
[45:14] i believe it'd be all throughout the
[45:16] plan of god because we see it in matthew
[45:18] 25 as we'll get to tonight
[45:20] we see people mercy that didn't expect
[45:23] it right
[45:24] and so when we see that we see a pattern
[45:26] of god's behavior
[45:27] all down through the bible times and all
[45:30] down through history
[45:32] praise god and we know the other example
[45:35] right
[45:36] joseph pardoning his brothers
[45:39] did they know what they were doing they
[45:40] didn't know what they were doing
[45:42] they were blinded right they didn't
[45:43] understand and joseph had to tell them
[45:46] you're forgiven god did this praise god
[45:49] amen god did it yes god allowed it
[45:53] god allowed them to get angry with
[45:55] joseph and throw them in the pit of
[45:57] him in the pit and sell them off to
[45:58] egypt so that god could preserve
[46:00] life and yet joseph forgave them because
[46:03] they didn't even know they
[46:04] that they were in the plan of god amen
[46:06] oh
[46:07] church can we say like this how many
[46:08] know that god's thoughts are higher than
[46:10] our thoughts
[46:11] amen god's ways are greater than our
[46:13] ways
[46:14] we may not understand what god's doing
[46:16] but god is doing something praise god
[46:18] we're even now even now by god's grace
[46:20] he's doing something now
[46:22] in 2020 as we come to the close of this
[46:24] year praise god
[46:25] he's doing something now we may not be
[46:27] able to see it but our duty is not to
[46:29] understand everything
[46:30] it's to believe his promises amen
[46:33] yes we'll understand a lot of the word
[46:34] we'll have good understanding in the
[46:36] doctrine and
[46:37] and how god works we'll have good
[46:38] understanding in that but we won't
[46:40] understand
[46:40] everything and even like we were talking
[46:43] on sunday with the squeeze we don't we
[46:44] didn't we don't even know what's going
[46:45] to happen with the squeeze
[46:47] there's some quotes there brother man
[46:48] says we'll be hunted down there's other
[46:50] quotes where he said the rapture will be
[46:51] so easy
[46:52] he said it'll be he said it'll be an
[46:54] easy thing it'll be just like going for
[46:56] a walk
[46:58] right and then there's other quotes that
[46:59] brother adam says that jesus
[47:01] will keep us from that our temptation
[47:04] right uh and so there's some quotes that
[47:06] make it look like there's pressure
[47:08] there's other quotes that make it look
[47:09] like it's going to be uh he calls it an
[47:11] easy thing
[47:12] but we know this if the anointing's on
[47:14] us it will be an easy thing praise god
[47:16] if the anointing of the holy spirit is
[47:18] transforming our minds
[47:19] then we'll look past these five senses
[47:22] praise god and we'll look to that
[47:24] sixth sense of faith praise god amen
[47:27] that's right now so that's the first one
[47:32] psalm 69 20. now verse 20
[47:36] let's go down to 21. they gave me also
[47:39] golf for my meat and in my thirst they
[47:41] gave
[47:41] me vinegar to drink so this is of course
[47:44] speaking of the crucifixion
[47:46] now look at verse uh 26 for they
[47:50] persecute him who has thou smitten
[47:52] and they talk to the grief of those whom
[47:53] now has wounded
[47:55] add iniquity unto their iniquity and let
[47:56] them not come into thy righteousness
[47:59] let them be blotted out of the book of
[48:00] the living and not be written
[48:02] with the righteous what a statement
[48:06] this is a psalm of david wow
[48:09] david again is prophesying of the
[48:11] crucifixion praise god
[48:13] how many times does he do it as a type
[48:15] of christ praise god
[48:17] hearing prophesies he says let their
[48:19] names be blotted out in other words god
[48:21] was looking down and he was seeing
[48:23] which ones at the cross were sincere the
[48:25] ones that were
[48:26] sincere and despised jesus he said i'm
[48:29] going to blot your name off the book in
[48:31] heaven
[48:32] he said but those you that don't know
[48:33] what you're doing i forgive you
[48:36] praise god i'm grateful for god's
[48:38] forgiveness
[48:39] how many want god to forgive you when
[48:41] you don't know what you're doing
[48:43] how many want god to forgive them when
[48:44] you do know what you're doing amen
[48:47] right i want god to forgive me when i
[48:49] purposely do
[48:50] something wrong or i'm in the flesh or
[48:52] i'm upset or i'm discouraged or i'm
[48:54] i'm doubting or anything like that i
[48:56] want god to be merciful and forgive me
[48:58] praise god
[48:59] amen jesus didn't pray in vain did he
[49:03] do you think he said a vain prayer of
[49:05] course not
[49:06] that means god forgave some of those
[49:09] that didn't know what they were doing
[49:10] but scripture tells us some of them did
[49:12] know what they were doing
[49:13] and so their names were blotted out
[49:17] now let's go to romans 11 here i just
[49:19] want to bring that back up that was such
[49:21] a powerful point to me
[49:23] i didn't really catch that until i wrote
[49:24] this chapter
[49:26] and i thought that would be necessary to
[49:28] show by god's grace
[49:29] so romans 11 uh there's three great
[49:32] truths regarding
[49:34] israel's blindness in this chapter three
[49:36] great truths the first one is they're
[49:38] not blinded forever
[49:40] praise god right that's verse
[49:43] one and now read verse eleven we read
[49:45] verse one for our opening
[49:47] romans eleven one they're not blinded
[49:50] forever
[49:54] now think about that hath god cast away
[49:56] his people it looked
[49:58] a lot like he was going to cast them
[50:00] away because he said i was married to
[50:02] you in ezekiel 16
[50:03] but then i found you immoral so i i put
[50:05] you away
[50:06] i'm writing you a bill of divorcement
[50:08] remember that in jeremiah
[50:09] jeremiah says god wrote a divorcement
[50:12] for israel and sent her away
[50:14] right he was so upset with israel he
[50:16] gave a divorcement against him sent him
[50:18] away
[50:19] and said i'm taking a gentile bride
[50:22] you would think that he'd be done with
[50:23] her but he wasn't because god is a god
[50:26] of mercy praise god
[50:27] and he's going to remember the covenant
[50:29] he made to their fathers
[50:30] abraham isaac and jacob praise god
[50:33] hallelujah and remember his word
[50:35] he remembers his love for those that are
[50:38] faithful amongst israel
[50:40] praise god look at verse 11.
[50:44] i say them have they stumbled that they
[50:46] should fall
[50:47] god forbid so everybody see when you
[50:50] stumble does that mean god's done with
[50:52] you when you stumble
[50:53] no sir
[50:56] he says god forbid but rather through
[50:58] their fall salvation
[51:00] is coming to the gentiles for to provoke
[51:02] them to jealousy
[51:04] in other words i'll say like this jews
[51:06] should watch our services
[51:08] and they should be jealous of how we
[51:09] love god right
[51:11] they should be jealous of our joy our
[51:13] freedom our liberty right our
[51:15] they should be jealous of us and the
[51:17] power of god
[51:19] because they've turned it down they turn
[51:21] on the power they turn on the blessings
[51:23] of god
[51:24] they should be jealous of our spirit
[51:26] that we have amongst us praise god
[51:29] the holy spirit that's amongst us
[51:31] hallelujah
[51:33] the bible says it provokes them to
[51:34] jealousy
[51:36] they should be jealous of of your
[51:38] feeling of how you feel forgiven praise
[51:40] god
[51:40] of how you feel so close to heaven are
[51:43] you
[51:44] assured of your destination you're
[51:47] assured to reach heaven
[51:48] you're you're guaranteed to reach the
[51:51] goal they should be jealous that you've
[51:53] got a seal praise god
[51:56] that your destiny is sealed to the day
[51:57] of your redemption
[51:59] praise god that's what the bible says
[52:01] they should watch and be
[52:02] jealous i'm glad pakistanians are
[52:04] watching for jose
[52:06] i'm glad colombians are watching or
[52:08] anything i i hope
[52:09] i hope if they're not born again i hope
[52:11] they're a little jealous too praise god
[52:13] of the freedom and love that we have in
[52:15] christ jesus amen
[52:17] i never forget when that uh hindu guy
[52:19] came to our church over at
[52:21] waterloo him and uh he came in there
[52:23] with john and i and he's like
[52:25] how do you preach like that he said how
[52:27] do you
[52:28] how do you rebuke all the sin john john
[52:30] and i were just kind of laughing
[52:31] he's like how do you do that he said if
[52:33] i preached like that acted like that
[52:35] my wife would laugh me out of the church
[52:38] because he said i can't live any of
[52:39] those things
[52:40] he said i'm a hypocrite to my wife now
[52:43] think about that church
[52:44] he was just walking by and heard us
[52:46] clapping and singing in that little hole
[52:47] in the wall
[52:48] and he said i just want to go in there
[52:50] and see what it's about and it so
[52:52] moved him that he had to come tell us
[52:55] that he was
[52:55] amazed by the sincerity and the love
[52:58] that we had
[52:59] and the standards of truth that we had
[53:01] praise god
[53:02] he didn't he wasn't used to he didn't
[53:04] see that and he was so thought so much
[53:06] about it he spent an extra two hours
[53:08] after service
[53:09] to tell us what he thought about it
[53:12] does your life should your life and your
[53:14] love make people jealous
[53:15] yes mine does at least mine john and i
[53:18] and we did at least a few years ago
[53:20] right all of us all of our love for god
[53:22] it made them jealous it made them take
[53:25] notice praise god
[53:26] that they had to recognize we've got
[53:28] something they don't have
[53:29] it's christ amen it's god's love it's
[53:33] god's power
[53:34] it's god's spirit it's god's strength
[53:36] praise god
[53:38] amen
[53:41] remember i i didn't plan to say that but
[53:43] story just came to my mind
[53:45] they just get jealous of you
[53:48] now look at verse 15.
[53:52] now the second fact is they're not
[53:53] forsaken for all time that's the first
[53:55] the second is he's saving gentiles while
[53:58] israel's blind and while they stumble
[54:01] so they're going to stumble the bible
[54:03] said they're going to stumble i really
[54:04] don't want to trip and fall on the floor
[54:05] but i was going to just demonstrate it
[54:06] they're going to stumble but not to the
[54:08] fall so they're just going to stumble
[54:10] but eventually they'll get back right
[54:13] they're going to stumble but not fall
[54:15] and be put away
[54:19] i'm glad god brings back the stumbling
[54:21] praise god
[54:22] i'm glad god brings that back those who
[54:24] struggle praise god
[54:26] amen now verse 15 let's read that
[54:29] for if the casting away of them be the
[54:31] reconciling of the world
[54:33] what shall the receiving of them be but
[54:36] life
[54:36] from the dead oh isn't that beautiful
[54:38] church in that beautiful
[54:40] what do you got tonight you got god
[54:42] reconciled to your life
[54:45] you you in other words you had god had
[54:47] no part with you didn't want to talk
[54:48] with you right because we were aliens
[54:50] outside the scripture we are far off
[54:52] from god but god reconciled you say hey
[54:55] come back to me come back to fellowship
[54:58] come know me
[54:59] i want to know you i want you to be in
[55:01] my family praise god
[55:03] that's a reconciliation
[55:07] and the bible says when the israel comes
[55:10] back when their spiritual eyes get open
[55:12] it's like they're going to have life
[55:14] from death it's like they're going to
[55:16] have a resurrection
[55:17] that's what the holy ghost is it's a
[55:18] resurrection praise god
[55:21] it's a seed that's quickened praise god
[55:23] that then right and it quickens my i got
[55:25] in the book i got eight different eight
[55:28] different uh symbolisms
[55:29] that the bible gives with a born-again
[55:31] experience one it's like putting on
[55:33] clothes
[55:34] two it's like getting rain right a third
[55:36] one is like this one
[55:37] it's like life from the dead it's being
[55:39] rotting out and then dying
[55:41] and life springing forward there's all
[55:43] these different it's like an empty cup
[55:44] being filled great god amen
[55:46] it's like a man being circumcised right
[55:49] there's all these different
[55:50] illustrations that god gives us and
[55:52] they're all true
[55:53] and they all point to the fact that we
[55:55] were dead in sins but now we're alive in
[55:57] christ
[56:00] glory thank you lord
[56:03] hmm
[56:06] i heard brother brown say that this week
[56:08] he goes after he said something
[56:11] honey that's how i feel praise god oh my
[56:14] thank you jesus
[56:15] so he's not forsaking israel for all
[56:17] time
[56:19] he's saving the gentiles while they're
[56:20] blinded
[56:23] uh let's read 23 here
[56:28] romans 11 23 and they also if they abide
[56:30] not still in unbelief
[56:32] shall be graft in for god is able to
[56:35] graft
[56:36] them in again wow god can cut off a
[56:38] branch
[56:39] now jose would know about a lot more
[56:40] about this than i would because he's a
[56:42] good landscaper and i'm not
[56:45] god can cut off a branch have it just
[56:48] sitting there
[56:49] and then whenever he wants he can just
[56:51] graft it back in how long does a branch
[56:53] last like that for jose if it's cut off
[56:55] do you know okay
[56:59] yeah that'd be interesting so uh i
[57:02] watched some videos and uh
[57:03] and we've gone to uh apple we've gone to
[57:05] a few apple orchards like two or three
[57:06] and i've seen
[57:07] branches that were grafted on and i've
[57:09] always wondered how you know how long do
[57:11] they got
[57:11] how long can they last being cut off
[57:13] until they get put back in
[57:15] but god is so great he's able to cut off
[57:17] the branch it lays there
[57:20] he's able to graft in the gentile branch
[57:22] produce all this fruit
[57:24] i'm talking about your life church amen
[57:27] is that right
[57:28] your life should have the fruits of the
[57:29] holy spirit praise god
[57:31] amen he's able to and see all these
[57:33] fruits of this gentile
[57:36] uh the gentile branch but then the bible
[57:38] said he's going to cut off the gentile
[57:39] branch
[57:40] and he's going to graft back in israel
[57:42] and they'll bring forth
[57:44] much fruit praise god amen
[57:49] so see their blindness is only temporary
[57:54] because that that branch will be grafted
[57:56] back in
[57:59] now verse 25 though
[58:03] is has an important statement at the
[58:04] very end it says blindness
[58:06] here's the third and most important part
[58:08] the blindness in part has happened to
[58:10] israel
[58:11] until the fullness of the gentiles come
[58:13] in i'm sorry let me go back and read
[58:14] again the blindness
[58:15] in part has happened everybody say in
[58:18] part ready
[58:20] in part just two little words in part
[58:21] blindness has only happened
[58:23] partially to israel not all israel was
[58:26] blinded to the messiah
[58:28] especially back in those days right and
[58:30] at 120 in the upper room get the holy
[58:32] ghost and
[58:32] all these other jews 3000 on the day of
[58:34] pentecost from all different nations
[58:36] jews three thousand got the holy ghost
[58:38] and got born again there
[58:41] so see it's only in part it's a partial
[58:44] blindness
[58:45] it's not a full blindness
[58:48] all right so that's the most important
[58:51] parts
[58:51] to say there now i want you to look at
[58:54] this too let's look at verse
[58:56] 5 romans 11 5.
[59:01] now romans 11 5 says even so then at
[59:04] this present time
[59:05] also there's a remnant according to the
[59:08] election of grace so that's what paul's
[59:09] saying
[59:10] there is a small group of elected
[59:13] gentiles remember the bible said many
[59:15] are called but you
[59:16] are chosen right so election means call
[59:21] they were called
[59:22] uh to this so i like how the bible says
[59:25] it
[59:26] it's an election of grace it's a calling
[59:29] of grace
[59:30] praise god god has done this
[59:33] as a favor to us how many appreciate
[59:36] god's favor to save you from hell praise
[59:39] god
[59:39] amen this is an elisa is a calling an
[59:42] election
[59:43] of favor amen he called you in his favor
[59:47] praise god
[59:50] an election of grace and he uses himself
[59:54] as an example paul said i'm an israelite
[59:56] i'm a seed of abraham i'm in the tribe
[59:58] of benjamin
[1:00:00] and so he says i'm one of those elected
[1:00:03] grace
[1:00:04] i'm so glad i'm one of those millions
[1:00:06] that brother branham saw
[1:00:07] running to him i'm beyond the curtain of
[1:00:09] time praise god i believe i'm one of
[1:00:11] them praise god
[1:00:12] just one of those that are elected to
[1:00:15] grace in this
[1:00:16] hour praise god amen
[1:00:20] remember paul said god forbid he would
[1:00:22] cast away his people he says it twice
[1:00:24] church
[1:00:24] twice he says god forbid
[1:00:30] because god is not gonna put them away
[1:00:34] notice and notice if you read this
[1:00:35] church paul never condemns israel does
[1:00:38] he
[1:00:39] he never says all these are oh they're
[1:00:42] surely
[1:00:42] headed for hell or anything like that he
[1:00:44] never says anything like that
[1:00:47] right now he reconciles them
[1:00:51] i'm sure he reconciles the gentiles now
[1:00:54] while the majority of israel is blinded
[1:00:57] pull up luke 21 24 this is such a
[1:01:00] uh foundational scripture for this
[1:01:02] revelation
[1:01:03] this uh revelation of the mystery of
[1:01:05] israel's blindness
[1:01:06] jesus christ calls it the times
[1:01:10] of the gentiles praise god so we're not
[1:01:13] you know with the church ages we're not
[1:01:14] you know making that up
[1:01:15] that's from christ christ calls it it's
[1:01:18] a time
[1:01:19] of the gentiles and they shall fall by
[1:01:22] the edge of the sword and shall be led
[1:01:23] away captive into all nations
[1:01:25] look at that all nations israel's and
[1:01:28] all nations
[1:01:28] and jerusalem shall be trodden down in
[1:01:30] the gentiles until the times of the
[1:01:33] gentiles
[1:01:34] be fulfilled so that means uh that means
[1:01:38] israel israel is not going to have
[1:01:40] control over jerusalem
[1:01:42] until the rapture goes right
[1:01:45] until the time of the gentiles be
[1:01:47] fulfilled so we got that's why we always
[1:01:49] keep our eye on israel right
[1:01:51] that's why we're interested in these
[1:01:52] peace deals right they have another one
[1:01:54] this week they made another one this
[1:01:55] week
[1:01:56] i think it was saudi arabia if i'm not
[1:01:57] mistaken they're in the talks
[1:01:59] i don't think it's official but they're
[1:02:00] in the talks so jerusalem will be uh
[1:02:04] it'll be taken control of by gentiles
[1:02:07] until the time of the gentiles
[1:02:09] is over and i don't know church i don't
[1:02:12] know if we'll see
[1:02:12] uh the gentiles lose their control i
[1:02:14] don't know if we'll see the temple
[1:02:16] rebuilt
[1:02:17] so the thing to do is stay really close
[1:02:19] the thing to do is stay attached to
[1:02:20] christ
[1:02:21] like a grafted branch and bring forth
[1:02:23] much fruit
[1:02:24] amen that's the thing to do how do you
[1:02:28] say how do you bring forth much fruit
[1:02:29] brother jesse
[1:02:30] abide in christ and christ is the word
[1:02:35] stay in the word stay in prayer
[1:02:38] jesus said apart from me you can do
[1:02:41] nothing
[1:02:42] i don't know about you but i want to do
[1:02:43] something for jesus
[1:02:45] and so if i'm gonna do anything for
[1:02:46] jesus i gotta abide in jesus
[1:02:49] i gotta abide in the word i gotta stay
[1:02:51] connected to the word
[1:02:52] in order to abide in christ
[1:02:55] that's how you bring forth much fruit
[1:02:59] all right now that's the that we there
[1:03:01] are six there's six proofs god can save
[1:03:03] blind and jews
[1:03:04] we've gone through two the cross jesus
[1:03:06] prayer paul's writing in romans 11 they
[1:03:08] can be saved
[1:03:10] uh next foreshadowing in the life of
[1:03:14] joseph
[1:03:17] all right so this shows that jews can be
[1:03:19] saved at the white throne judgment
[1:03:21] despite
[1:03:22] uh rejecting christ in their lifetime
[1:03:25] joseph's life's
[1:03:26] life before slavery types jesus's first
[1:03:29] coming to earth
[1:03:31] and remember a type four tells someone
[1:03:33] or some event to come in the future
[1:03:34] that's what a type is
[1:03:37] now let's go through these these are
[1:03:38] just real beautiful to go through joseph
[1:03:41] was beloved of his father jacob
[1:03:42] christ was beloved of his heavenly
[1:03:44] father joseph was spiritual
[1:03:46] he shared prophetic dreams with his
[1:03:48] brothers who despised them
[1:03:49] can you imagine despising people's
[1:03:51] dreams you know why it despise them
[1:03:53] because they were bowing down
[1:03:55] they didn't want to be humble right
[1:03:58] right but if ever if i ever saw a dream
[1:04:01] of bowing down to jesus i'd say amen
[1:04:03] right because he's he's the one we're
[1:04:05] all going to bow down to praise god
[1:04:08] he said uh then christ was spiritual
[1:04:11] preaching and prophesying to israel
[1:04:13] who despised his words joseph was sent
[1:04:16] to check on his brethren but they sold
[1:04:17] him to egypt
[1:04:18] christ was sent to preach to israel but
[1:04:20] they sold him out to rome
[1:04:23] joseph was falsely accused and in prison
[1:04:25] jesus falsely accused and arrested
[1:04:28] while in prison joseph ministered to two
[1:04:30] prisoners one lived one died
[1:04:32] while on the cross jesus was between two
[1:04:34] prisoners one was promised eternal life
[1:04:36] in paradise and the other lost
[1:04:38] joseph was resurrected out of prison and
[1:04:40] set as second in command of pharaoh
[1:04:43] jesus was resurrected on the tomb and
[1:04:45] ascended to the right hand of the
[1:04:46] majesty on high tonight
[1:04:48] where he sits tonight making
[1:04:49] intercession for you
[1:04:51] amen he still sits up there
[1:04:54] wanting to hear your prayers wanting to
[1:04:56] hear your worship wanting to meet your
[1:04:58] needs if you just believe it praise god
[1:05:01] amen well second in command joseph was
[1:05:04] given
[1:05:05] an egyptian or gentile wife just as
[1:05:08] christ now
[1:05:09] offers salvation to the gentiles
[1:05:12] and he's been given a gentile bride
[1:05:15] the new testament church during the
[1:05:17] famine joseph's brothers go to egypt to
[1:05:19] get food
[1:05:20] but they're blinded to their brothers
[1:05:22] our identity yet he's merciful to them
[1:05:25] and the saints said they're blind and
[1:05:28] they don't know who he is
[1:05:29] but he's still merciful to them they've
[1:05:32] done evil to him right
[1:05:33] they've done evil they understand it but
[1:05:37] he's still merciful to them he still
[1:05:38] feeds their hungry souls
[1:05:41] oh my what a savior
[1:05:45] in type jesus was crucified
[1:05:48] in order to spiritually save all people
[1:05:51] gentiles and jews during the spiritual
[1:05:53] famine of the seven church ages let me
[1:05:54] know this has been a spiritual famine
[1:05:56] the bible said there be a famine not for
[1:05:59] the food or water but for the hearing of
[1:06:00] god's word
[1:06:03] right and you know what was the worst
[1:06:05] famine the worst famine was actually
[1:06:07] during the fourth church age brother
[1:06:08] braham said that was the darkest time
[1:06:11] now is the most deceitful time right the
[1:06:13] most deceptive time
[1:06:14] but brother rams said in the in the that
[1:06:16] third tier church age
[1:06:17] jezebel uh took them to the very depths
[1:06:20] of satan
[1:06:21] can you imagine that that woman leader
[1:06:23] taking them to the painted face
[1:06:25] short-haired bob-haired sexy dress
[1:06:28] murderous woman
[1:06:29] she took them to the very depths of
[1:06:30] satan
[1:06:32] as low as you could almost go take the
[1:06:35] word from them
[1:06:36] take everything away from them uh they
[1:06:38] hardly have anything right
[1:06:39] but then god jesus said don't touch
[1:06:41] their oil and wine praise god
[1:06:43] hallelujah don't touch the the
[1:06:46] revelation that they got
[1:06:47] don't touch the holy ghost of the god
[1:06:49] let the saints keep that experience with
[1:06:51] god
[1:06:52] amen but jezebel took them to the very
[1:06:56] depths
[1:06:57] sounds like a famine to me right
[1:07:02] they're battling the very depths of
[1:07:04] satan himself
[1:07:10] yes we know it's true now
[1:07:14] the white throne judgment i'm sorry i
[1:07:16] got one more to go
[1:07:19] joseph then gives his brothers land in
[1:07:22] goshen
[1:07:23] with everything they need so will christ
[1:07:26] reveal himself to the jews
[1:07:28] during the tribulation and re-establish
[1:07:30] them in their promised land
[1:07:32] jerusalem so he reestablishes his
[1:07:35] brothers
[1:07:36] praise god that's what we should be
[1:07:38] doing is there anybody that you can help
[1:07:40] and strengthen this week
[1:07:42] think about that anybody who can
[1:07:43] strengthen over thanksgiving break
[1:07:45] right well at least for me i don't know
[1:07:47] hopefully you got nobody know you guys
[1:07:49] don't have to work over thanksgiving
[1:07:50] but who can you establish who can you
[1:07:52] strengthen who can you be a blessing to
[1:07:55] to make them stronger and to make them
[1:07:58] more
[1:07:58] in love with christ who can you help out
[1:08:00] that's a good question
[1:08:02] i trust the holy spirit we'll put
[1:08:03] somebody in your heart here
[1:08:05] i know we can help out that columbia
[1:08:06] sister can't we jose praise god
[1:08:10] there's somebody there if we if we have
[1:08:12] ears that can hear
[1:08:14] right hear what the spirit says to the
[1:08:16] churches
[1:08:17] let's hear what the holy spirit's saying
[1:08:18] and we can help somebody out praise god
[1:08:21] strengthen them establish them help them
[1:08:26] now joseph being merciful to his
[1:08:28] brothers is
[1:08:29] like the white throne judgment when
[1:08:31] jesus has
[1:08:32] all nations before him and he grants
[1:08:36] eternal life to the surprise doers of
[1:08:38] good works
[1:08:39] that were seemingly blinded to his
[1:08:41] identity during their lives
[1:08:44] this group has to include israel because
[1:08:46] the bible said all nations are there
[1:08:51] this is a blessed group they're saved
[1:08:54] but they're unaware of christ's presence
[1:08:57] living inside his followers
[1:08:58] in other words they're blinded to
[1:09:00] christ's body his church
[1:09:02] but let me say like this real christians
[1:09:04] are not blinded to other
[1:09:06] christians and the saints said i'm
[1:09:08] talking about if you've got the holy
[1:09:09] ghost
[1:09:10] you are not blinded to other believers
[1:09:14] go to philippians lydia keep up
[1:09:15] philippians 4 3.
[1:09:17] now this is right where i left off with
[1:09:19] my series on the philippians so it kind
[1:09:21] of fits i guess for tonight
[1:09:23] lord willing we'll pick it up maybe
[1:09:24] sunday we'll see what the lord puts on
[1:09:26] our hearts
[1:09:27] all we do is lay ourselves before him
[1:09:29] and ask god to be merciful
[1:09:31] let's see if paul how do we bother the
[1:09:32] holy ghost let's see if he could discern
[1:09:35] well
[1:09:35] are these people saved or not can i
[1:09:38] recognize the body of christ or not look
[1:09:40] what he says
[1:09:41] i entreat thee also true yoke fellow
[1:09:44] help those women which
[1:09:45] labored with me in the gospel
[1:09:48] with clement also and with other my
[1:09:52] fellow laborers whose names are in
[1:09:55] the book of life amen praise god
[1:09:58] can paul recognize who's saved church
[1:10:01] can paul recognize it
[1:10:03] yeah how do you recognize it the people
[1:10:05] that came alongside the message
[1:10:08] and yoked themselves to my ministry amen
[1:10:11] so joseph leave your names on the book
[1:10:13] of life
[1:10:14] sister naomi sister beatrice and my
[1:10:16] children you little children
[1:10:18] i believe your names are on the land's
[1:10:20] book of life praise god
[1:10:21] remember there's two books there's the
[1:10:22] lambs and there's a book of life
[1:10:24] that records all the people that are
[1:10:26] living but there's a lamb's book of life
[1:10:28] that's a special book that you can't
[1:10:30] remove those
[1:10:31] names hallelujah it's those who
[1:10:33] recognize the messenger
[1:10:35] and labored with that messenger for that
[1:10:38] day
[1:10:39] oh yeah we know who the body of christ
[1:10:41] is
[1:10:42] praise god glory praise god
[1:10:46] but these people there's a whole big
[1:10:48] multitude sister beatrice a whole
[1:10:49] multitude
[1:10:50] and they're like when did we ever see
[1:10:51] you
[1:10:53] i see christ in jose all the time right
[1:10:57] i hope you see him in me
[1:10:58] praise god i i want to i see him in you
[1:11:01] but they're like we didn't even know you
[1:11:03] were there and yeah brother ann's whole
[1:11:05] ministry saints
[1:11:06] is to get you to see what christ in you
[1:11:09] praise god
[1:11:10] you're you're god's masterpiece right
[1:11:12] now is that right
[1:11:14] the identified christ of every age it's
[1:11:17] christ in you
[1:11:18] praise god and you're telling me these
[1:11:20] people had the holy ghost and like
[1:11:22] when did we ever see jesus i never knew
[1:11:25] there was jesus
[1:11:27] that's that's the only way we see it is
[1:11:28] in you right
[1:11:30] the only way we jesus can do anything
[1:11:31] with hands is your hands right
[1:11:33] the only way that we can you can spread
[1:11:35] the gospels through your feet praise god
[1:11:37] the only way you can preach is through
[1:11:38] men of god praise god
[1:11:40] the only way you can train those
[1:11:41] children and lead them to christ is
[1:11:43] through your mother's praise god
[1:11:45] and grandmas for beatrice
[1:11:48] that's the only way you can do it he
[1:11:51] can't use anybody else
[1:11:53] but when we see something happen when we
[1:11:55] see god do a miracle or see somebody say
[1:11:57] or something that's christ in them
[1:12:01] like when naomi and beatrice prayed for
[1:12:03] my wife for the transverse that was
[1:12:04] christ of them i clearly saw christ in
[1:12:06] them
[1:12:07] because they prayed i'm scared we're
[1:12:09] scared my wife and i are scared
[1:12:10] they pray with faith they raise our
[1:12:12] faith and the next day god hears their
[1:12:14] prayer instantly like that
[1:12:15] and like i said i didn't go run to my
[1:12:17] mom who's got bob here i didn't even go
[1:12:19] tell her to pray for me
[1:12:21] because i didn't need to because god had
[1:12:22] these sisters right here to pray for us
[1:12:24] amen
[1:12:26] see so look at the scripture church look
[1:12:28] at the scripture a holy ghost-filled
[1:12:30] saint
[1:12:31] can recognize other holy ghost-filled
[1:12:33] saints
[1:12:35] now there's a few cases sister beatrice
[1:12:36] knows this very well there's a few cases
[1:12:38] people we thought heather and his book
[1:12:40] on the life
[1:12:41] sometimes turn out we don't know if
[1:12:43] their names are on the book of life
[1:12:45] but most the time with most saints
[1:12:48] that labor with the messenger like paul
[1:12:51] most of time
[1:12:52] we know their names on the book of life
[1:12:53] because paul said i know there are names
[1:12:55] on the book of life because they labored
[1:12:57] with me
[1:12:58] in other words they were yoked to the
[1:13:00] message church praise god
[1:13:02] amen they were tied to christ they were
[1:13:05] tied to god's ministry amen praise god
[1:13:10] you know church we're really one of the
[1:13:12] few churches out there that believes in
[1:13:14] the fightful ministry
[1:13:15] most denominational churches don't
[1:13:16] accept any prophets
[1:13:18] now we don't have many living today
[1:13:20] right we don't have many brother books
[1:13:21] prophesied sometimes you know for 30
[1:13:23] years and years between i'm waiting for
[1:13:26] the next one actually
[1:13:29] but we're one of the few churches sister
[1:13:31] beatrice in the world
[1:13:32] that believes in the five full ministry
[1:13:36] right we got pastors teachers right we
[1:13:38] got evangelists
[1:13:40] uh apostles we got prophets we actually
[1:13:44] believe in prophets today praise god
[1:13:46] most people don't believe in that and so
[1:13:49] it separates us right away as wow
[1:13:51] we're part of the let groom praise god
[1:13:53] we're a part we're just like paul's
[1:13:55] group praise god where they had prophets
[1:13:56] among them
[1:13:57] amen now our at least in my life
[1:14:01] the the most prophecy we've done is
[1:14:02] through prayers through dreams
[1:14:05] right through dreams and also speaking
[1:14:08] the word that's for telling the future
[1:14:10] then it happens
[1:14:11] right now not every time right i'm still
[1:14:13] waiting on some of these things i've
[1:14:14] spoken to
[1:14:15] i'm still waiting on some of them but
[1:14:17] the times where it's happened
[1:14:19] that's the spirit of prophecy is the
[1:14:21] spirit of jesus christ
[1:14:23] amen now i didn't mean to go off on all
[1:14:26] that but praise the lord anyhow amen
[1:14:29] now see
[1:14:32] paul knows whose names are in the book
[1:14:34] of life
[1:14:37] because you've labored with me i've
[1:14:38] labored with you i believe your names in
[1:14:40] the book of life
[1:14:42] i hope you believe my name's in there
[1:14:43] too because paul said those who labored
[1:14:46] with me yoke fellow
[1:14:50] you realized her she's calling him a
[1:14:51] bunch of cows did you realize that
[1:14:53] yolk fella right
[1:14:56] how many ox right we got any oxen
[1:14:58] brother says i'm the ox of the team
[1:15:02] well you can't god doesn't mix other ox
[1:15:04] with donkeys right like that that's
[1:15:06] scriptural
[1:15:08] so god's likening us unto laboring
[1:15:11] laboring cattle praise god
[1:15:14] we're just laboring together we're both
[1:15:16] working together praise god we're both
[1:15:18] working for the kingdom of god amen
[1:15:20] we're yoked together in christ jesus
[1:15:22] amen
[1:15:23] yes so jesus saves a group who doesn't
[1:15:28] know
[1:15:28] who jesus was while on earth they didn't
[1:15:30] even know who he was
[1:15:32] but he saves them because they gave him
[1:15:33] food drink shelter clothing
[1:15:35] made sick visits and prison visits to
[1:15:37] the body of christ
[1:15:40] now here's what i bang and i were
[1:15:41] emailed about this few months ago is
[1:15:42] vengeance out there
[1:15:43] god bless him if he is here's the
[1:15:46] thought on this
[1:15:48] this is my thought you know because many
[1:15:50] times we believe well people got to
[1:15:52] repent and go to heaven like the thief
[1:15:53] on the cross i agree too
[1:15:55] so i so this is what i i've just boiled
[1:15:57] down to if god saves these people and
[1:16:00] they're not even realizing what they're
[1:16:01] doing
[1:16:01] then to me uh when they when they went
[1:16:04] and visited the sick person in the
[1:16:05] hospital that was them trying to contact
[1:16:07] god saying god
[1:16:09] forgive me help me to do something right
[1:16:11] i just want to be what
[1:16:13] i just want to do something right now
[1:16:16] that's the only way i can understand it
[1:16:17] if god does have to say through
[1:16:19] repentance like the thief on the cross
[1:16:21] uh then that's the way i'd understand it
[1:16:23] they they uh they they uh
[1:16:25] they give food right they give clothes
[1:16:27] i'm sorry i can't remember the other one
[1:16:28] oh then they made
[1:16:29] they made prison business they go visit
[1:16:30] a persecuted christian
[1:16:32] and on their way there they're like if
[1:16:34] there is a god or
[1:16:36] god i know that's real uh forgive me of
[1:16:38] my sins
[1:16:39] i'm going to go visit this christian in
[1:16:40] the hospital i don't know how it works
[1:16:43] out
[1:16:44] but we can all clearly see that this
[1:16:46] group that saved
[1:16:48] they don't really know who jesus was
[1:16:50] right they didn't know
[1:16:51] when did we see you lord when did we see
[1:16:53] you but yeah we see god all the time in
[1:16:55] each other praise god
[1:16:57] i know about you but i see my wife all
[1:16:59] the time because she's really patient
[1:17:00] with me brother jose
[1:17:02] and she labors and serves these children
[1:17:04] like like like christ
[1:17:05] like that's i guess that's the best
[1:17:07] thing i could say it's like christ
[1:17:09] and i want to work my tail off so i so
[1:17:11] they see christ in me
[1:17:13] only such a devoted dad such a faithful
[1:17:16] provider
[1:17:16] that they see christ i want them to see
[1:17:18] the kindness of jesus christ in me
[1:17:20] sister teachers
[1:17:21] that's what i want them to see
[1:17:24] that there is a dad there that's got the
[1:17:26] holy ghost that's my dad i hope that's
[1:17:28] what they say i didn't tell them to say
[1:17:29] that
[1:17:30] i don't even know if they say that but
[1:17:31] that's how i want to live my life praise
[1:17:33] god
[1:17:33] that they can see jesus christ in me
[1:17:37] amen
[1:17:42] so just like jesus like joseph uh
[1:17:46] jesus was not blinded to their
[1:17:47] identities he remembered their good
[1:17:49] works to the church
[1:17:50] and he and they obtained mercy just like
[1:17:53] joseph remembered the good things
[1:17:55] that the brothers did right they were
[1:17:57] honest remember they were honest he
[1:17:58] tested them he put their money back in
[1:17:59] their back
[1:18:00] and joseph remembered that they were
[1:18:02] honest they learned their lesson he
[1:18:04] remembered the good things
[1:18:06] they said does my father yet live give
[1:18:09] me back
[1:18:10] i want to see daddy praise god amen
[1:18:12] glory
[1:18:16] now go to acts 10 34 and 35.
[1:18:21] then i got another scripture i wrote
[1:18:22] down i guess i
[1:18:24] emailed to myself using my voice while i
[1:18:26] was driving that's really nice i like
[1:18:27] that voice dictation
[1:18:30] i'll say hey and i'll say email myself
[1:18:32] this while i'm driving that's really
[1:18:33] nice
[1:18:35] uh acts 17 please 34
[1:18:39] and 35.
[1:18:45] and i'm looking up another scripture
[1:18:47] just bear with me oh yeah okay all right
[1:18:48] let's read that how be that certain men
[1:18:50] claim unto him and believe
[1:18:52] that's paul among the witch was dionysus
[1:18:55] the
[1:18:56] r.o paguet and a woman named uh demerius
[1:19:00] yeah and others with them verse 35.
[1:19:04] now i'm sorry i'm in the wrong i must
[1:19:07] have had a typo
[1:19:08] was that act 17 ah it's acts 10
[1:19:12] acts 10 i'm sorry x10 i i read it wrong
[1:19:15] i'm
[1:19:16] jumping too far ahead forgive me acts 10
[1:19:19] 34.
[1:19:20] i'm in a big old hurry why am i in a
[1:19:22] hurry
[1:19:23] i shouldn't even hurry then peter opened
[1:19:25] his mouth and said of a truth i perceive
[1:19:27] that god
[1:19:28] is no respecter of persons right
[1:19:31] but in every nation he that fears him so
[1:19:34] leave this up here for a while lydia
[1:19:35] and worketh righteousness is accepted of
[1:19:37] him so again that that's how i think
[1:19:39] god could save a muslim now i could be
[1:19:40] wrong on this but that's what's what i
[1:19:42] believe
[1:19:43] i believe that's how god could serve a
[1:19:44] hindu he really is not into hinduism
[1:19:46] he's really not into muslim faith he
[1:19:48] know it's there's none there's no life
[1:19:50] in it
[1:19:51] right but yet he fears god he knows
[1:19:54] there's a god
[1:19:55] and he he goes to visit a christian in
[1:19:58] the hospital
[1:19:59] and he fears god he knows there's a god
[1:20:01] somehow he can't explain the creation
[1:20:03] you don't really believe the muslim
[1:20:04] faith you know he just follows along
[1:20:06] with it
[1:20:07] but he fears god and god doesn't respect
[1:20:09] he's not a respectable person so god's
[1:20:11] looking for every person that fears the
[1:20:13] living god
[1:20:14] and then perhaps through that visit to
[1:20:16] the christian in the
[1:20:18] the prison that was his time to do good
[1:20:21] to jesus
[1:20:23] and he didn't even know what he was
[1:20:24] doing he maybe he wasn't sure about
[1:20:26] jesus i don't know
[1:20:27] i but how else can you explain it by the
[1:20:30] scripture
[1:20:32] we have to look at the scripture and
[1:20:33] they don't let jesus when did we see you
[1:20:36] so that they didn't have a dream of
[1:20:37] jesus they didn't have a vision brother
[1:20:38] jose
[1:20:39] they didn't know they didn't even know
[1:20:40] jesus
[1:20:43] when did we see you we never saw you we
[1:20:46] never saw a vision
[1:20:47] right we never saw a dream
[1:20:50] but because they did something righteous
[1:20:53] to a part of the body of christ jesus
[1:20:56] says you've done it unto me
[1:20:58] amen now now go to acts 17. now here's
[1:21:02] the one that's a
[1:21:02] real stickler here 17 30.
[1:21:07] well actually go to 29 29. this is
[1:21:09] paul's beautiful message on mars hill
[1:21:12] for as much then as we are the offspring
[1:21:14] of god we ought not to think that the
[1:21:16] godhead is like under
[1:21:17] gold anybody just get happy there you're
[1:21:20] god's child praise god
[1:21:21] did you see that i am a son of jesus
[1:21:25] praise god i'm a child of god amen
[1:21:27] i'm the offspring of god i'm i'm his son
[1:21:31] praise god we ought not to think that
[1:21:33] god is like on the gold silver stone
[1:21:35] graven by art and man's device next
[1:21:37] verse
[1:21:38] 30 because he has pointed day in which
[1:21:40] he will judge the world of righteousness
[1:21:43] i'm sorry what was that verse is that
[1:21:46] the right verse
[1:21:47] oh sorry okay and the times of this
[1:21:49] ignorance god winked at so he winked at
[1:21:51] that
[1:21:51] uh the previous verse was idolatry right
[1:21:54] stones and wood and gold
[1:21:56] he winked at that kind of idolatry but
[1:21:58] now commandeth all men
[1:22:00] everywhere to repent how's that done
[1:22:02] through preachers right
[1:22:04] that's done through preachers so this is
[1:22:06] why i said like if god does save
[1:22:08] these people by repentance then that
[1:22:10] let's say that muslim person you have to
[1:22:11] say
[1:22:11] god forgive me maybe you don't even know
[1:22:13] his name's jesus but he knows there's a
[1:22:15] god he knows he's not allah
[1:22:16] because he don't talk back right he sees
[1:22:19] that there are the murders he sees there
[1:22:21] they mistreat women they abuse women
[1:22:23] from young ages they do evil things
[1:22:25] women are they don't even have equal
[1:22:27] status they're like dogs they're like
[1:22:29] servants in the muslim faith many times
[1:22:32] but he but somehow he he says god
[1:22:36] forgive me i know this is a righteous
[1:22:38] person i knew that
[1:22:39] i knew that christian uh he's in there
[1:22:41] falsely i'm gonna go visit him in prison
[1:22:44] and that must be his time of repentance
[1:22:47] remember church all we hear about the
[1:22:49] thief on the cross is he says
[1:22:51] why you space why why are you thief
[1:22:53] speaking all these evil things about
[1:22:55] jesus
[1:22:55] he's done nothing wrong then he said
[1:22:58] remember me
[1:22:59] when you go to your kingdom right
[1:23:02] he said i'm guilty he said we're all
[1:23:04] guilty but this man has done nothing
[1:23:05] wrong
[1:23:06] so see as long as these people and
[1:23:07] nations say they're wrong
[1:23:09] they know they're guilty they haven't
[1:23:11] seen jesus they don't they're not going
[1:23:12] to see jesus as the white throne
[1:23:14] judgment
[1:23:15] and as long as they do these acts it's
[1:23:17] as if they're repenting
[1:23:19] that's what it looks like to me
[1:23:22] okay i hope that helps by god's grace
[1:23:23] let's do one more here uh give me uh let
[1:23:25] me set timer here give me ten more
[1:23:26] minutes here let's get started on this
[1:23:28] fifth seal
[1:23:28] because it's a beautiful beautiful uh
[1:23:31] teaching here
[1:23:32] okay so this is number three notice
[1:23:34] number four
[1:23:35] we have the first proof of jesus prayer
[1:23:37] jesus forgives those that are that don't
[1:23:38] know what they're doing
[1:23:40] uh romans 11 proves he still says
[1:23:43] blinded
[1:23:43] uh jews foreshadowing the life of joseph
[1:23:46] that's number three proves he saves
[1:23:49] blinded jews
[1:23:50] and number four is the physio
[1:23:54] revelation six nine through eleven lady
[1:23:55] can you point out there revelation six
[1:23:57] nine through eleven this is irrefutable
[1:23:59] evidence and the part i like it's got
[1:24:01] thus saith the lord behind it praise god
[1:24:03] brother and said thus say the lord the
[1:24:05] revelations of those seals
[1:24:07] are right thus saith the lord revelation
[1:24:11] 6 9-11 when he opened the fifth seal
[1:24:13] i saw under the altar the souls of them
[1:24:15] that were slain for the word of god
[1:24:17] and the testimony that they held verse
[1:24:20] 10
[1:24:23] and they cried with a loud voice saying
[1:24:24] how long o lord holy and true
[1:24:26] thus not or dost thou not judge and
[1:24:29] avenge our blood on them
[1:24:30] that dwell on the earth verse 11. and
[1:24:33] white robes were given unto
[1:24:34] every one of them and it was said to
[1:24:36] them that they should rest for a little
[1:24:38] season
[1:24:38] until their fellow servants also and
[1:24:41] their brethren that should be killed as
[1:24:42] they were should be
[1:24:44] fulfilled all right now there's a four
[1:24:47] proofs these are jews
[1:24:49] you probably can say them right after i
[1:24:51] do they're slain for the word of god and
[1:24:53] not
[1:24:55] the testimony of jesus right doesn't say
[1:24:57] anything about the testimony of jesus
[1:24:59] it just says they're slain for the word
[1:25:00] of god and the word of god is the old
[1:25:02] testament
[1:25:03] that's revelation 1 2. can you pull up
[1:25:05] there revelation 1 2 and revelation 1
[1:25:07] 9 both say this revelation 1
[1:25:11] 2. john says i bear record of the word
[1:25:14] of god
[1:25:14] and the testimony of jesus christ amen
[1:25:18] look at verse 9 i john also
[1:25:22] am your brother in companion tribulation
[1:25:24] and the kingdom and patience of jesus
[1:25:26] christ was in the aisle that's called
[1:25:27] patmos for the word of god
[1:25:29] and the testimony of jesus christ
[1:25:33] so these souls under the altar do not
[1:25:35] have the testimony
[1:25:36] of jesus christ
[1:25:40] they're not slain for jesus they're
[1:25:42] saying for the word of god
[1:25:45] all right second
[1:25:48] they call for vengeance on those who
[1:25:51] killed them
[1:25:51] but christians do not call for vengeance
[1:25:54] stephen in acts 7 verse 6
[1:25:56] uh said lay this not to their charge
[1:26:00] and jesus on the cross said father
[1:26:02] forgive them they don't know what
[1:26:03] they're doing
[1:26:04] real christians pray for the forgiveness
[1:26:06] of their persecutors
[1:26:09] third white robes were given to them
[1:26:12] after
[1:26:12] they well after they died but
[1:26:15] christians have white robes already
[1:26:18] right
[1:26:19] the baptism in the soul represents as
[1:26:22] type as a robe because jesus said you'll
[1:26:25] be
[1:26:26] endued with power from on high in luke
[1:26:29] 24
[1:26:30] 49 and dude means clothes
[1:26:33] in other words you're going to get a
[1:26:34] clothing of the baptism of the holy
[1:26:37] ghost praise god
[1:26:38] and then paul said in romans 13 14
[1:26:41] he says put you on the lord jesus christ
[1:26:45] amen
[1:26:46] he didn't say leave it on the hangar he
[1:26:48] said put on jesus
[1:26:50] christ so see the holy spirit is like a
[1:26:53] garment
[1:26:54] so when you're born again and you're a
[1:26:56] holy ghost filled saint
[1:26:57] uh the bible tells us this you have your
[1:27:00] the holy ghost is like clothes
[1:27:02] you're clothed in other words the white
[1:27:04] robe is on your soul we'll say it like
[1:27:06] that
[1:27:07] now the real right robe is a glorified
[1:27:09] body or the theophany right
[1:27:12] the real white robe is the theophany in
[1:27:14] heaven
[1:27:15] that's the wheel with a real white robe
[1:27:17] sorry i got my words mixed up here
[1:27:20] but see if when someone's born again
[1:27:23] they've got the white robe and as soon
[1:27:24] as they die they go put on that white
[1:27:26] robe
[1:27:28] because it's that theophany paul said
[1:27:30] when my body dies here
[1:27:32] i go to be clothed with that eternal
[1:27:34] body in the heavens
[1:27:36] oh i can't wait to be close with that
[1:27:37] one praise god i can't wait to drop this
[1:27:39] one off
[1:27:39] and get a real one praise god a real
[1:27:42] white robe a real body praise god that's
[1:27:45] eternal
[1:27:47] we'll have no ending no pain
[1:27:51] see so jesus promises the fifth seal
[1:27:54] israelis robes just like joseph gave his
[1:27:58] brother new raymond in genesis
[1:28:00] 45 22 when he made himself known to them
[1:28:04] praise god pull that up there genesis 45
[1:28:07] 20. remember that
[1:28:08] he reveals himself and then he blesses
[1:28:10] them with new robes praise god right
[1:28:12] romans and the bible
[1:28:14] called it revelation 7 the bible said
[1:28:16] the father seal is written upon their
[1:28:18] foreheads amen
[1:28:19] hallelujah see there's there's these
[1:28:21] different symbols god uses
[1:28:23] see on the forehead circumcised filled
[1:28:26] up
[1:28:26] uh uh and now here clothed with right
[1:28:30] white robes praise god
[1:28:32] all these all point to the baptism of
[1:28:34] the holy ghost
[1:28:39] yes here it is uh to all them gave me
[1:28:42] each man
[1:28:42] changes of raymond but to benjamin he
[1:28:44] gave 300 pieces of silver
[1:28:46] and five changes arrangement praise god
[1:28:50] that that's the type of being saved your
[1:28:52] eyes are open to christ oh it's joseph
[1:28:54] my brother
[1:28:55] it's jesus our savior and they get the
[1:28:58] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:29:00] they get food and new clothes
[1:29:03] amen praise god
[1:29:07] what a blessing and fourth and finally
[1:29:12] he says there's more fellow servants
[1:29:14] brethren of the jews
[1:29:16] who must be martyred to fulfill a divine
[1:29:19] appointed number god's the only one who
[1:29:21] knows his number because remember they
[1:29:23] cried out at the cross they said
[1:29:24] let his blood be upon us and our
[1:29:27] children
[1:29:28] that self-inflicted curse we talked
[1:29:29] about
[1:29:31] so only god knows that number yet he'll
[1:29:34] end that persecution
[1:29:35] when the 144 000 jews are converted
[1:29:41] praise god
[1:29:44] and lord willing next time we'll look at
[1:29:46] this this fifth seal also
[1:29:49] shows the three different locations for
[1:29:51] souls after
[1:29:52] death you have under the altar that's
[1:29:54] the jew
[1:29:56] you have paradise which must be by this
[1:30:00] near the near to the throne of god
[1:30:03] and then you have prison in the heart of
[1:30:04] the earth you have three locations
[1:30:07] right because god's perfected in three
[1:30:09] three locations for souls
[1:30:12] then i can find the scripture under the
[1:30:14] altar
[1:30:15] paradise above the altar or the heart of
[1:30:18] the earth
[1:30:19] the prison house
[1:30:25] i don't know about you church but isn't
[1:30:26] it beautiful to see
[1:30:28] how faithful blinded jews as long as
[1:30:31] they're true to god's covenant
[1:30:33] they find shelter for their souls under
[1:30:37] the altar of god
[1:30:40] what a beautiful place to be
[1:30:46] can you imagine you're blind your whole
[1:30:49] life and you don't even know you don't
[1:30:50] even know the name of god the god in
[1:30:52] heaven can you imagine that
[1:30:54] you don't know god's name in heaven you
[1:30:56] know there's a god
[1:30:58] but you think his name's just jehovah
[1:31:01] right or
[1:31:02] or just the i am you think that's his
[1:31:04] name and you don't even know
[1:31:06] that he's got one name that's above all
[1:31:08] other names amen
[1:31:11] and your your whole life you try to
[1:31:12] serve god as a faithful jew
[1:31:14] and eat the right foods and try to wear
[1:31:16] the right clothes
[1:31:18] and don't eat shrimp and all these
[1:31:20] things don't eat pork
[1:31:22] and you sacrifice all that and you go to
[1:31:25] heaven
[1:31:25] and you find out it wasn't it wasn't
[1:31:28] what i thought
[1:31:30] the god of the old testament is jesus of
[1:31:32] the new praise god
[1:31:34] and yet brother sister he still don't
[1:31:37] hold it against you
[1:31:38] he says come there's a place for you you
[1:31:40] had to be blinded so i could see
[1:31:42] see these other ones up here see these
[1:31:44] other ones with white robes and palms
[1:31:46] palm leaves he said i had to blind you
[1:31:50] in order to save them
[1:31:54] now how do you think they feel you think
[1:31:55] they feel pretty good yes they're right
[1:31:57] under the altar of christ
[1:32:00] they're right under that altar and they
[1:32:02] can cry up and say
[1:32:03] how long well that's basically how they
[1:32:05] live their life right with the altar
[1:32:07] thinking oh we're going to get the
[1:32:08] sacrifice oh we need to alter we need
[1:32:10] the temple back we need
[1:32:11] that's all they thought about was the
[1:32:12] altar to get the temple back and
[1:32:14] so god fittingly puts them under the
[1:32:17] altar
[1:32:19] so they can be close to the altar and
[1:32:21] because that's what they wanted
[1:32:23] this whole time they're expecting a
[1:32:24] physical one but god shows them the true
[1:32:26] altar
[1:32:27] the altar of jesus christ let's stand to
[1:32:29] our feet praise god
[1:32:34] what beautiful shelter god gives he's
[1:32:36] blind to jews
[1:32:37] what sweet confirmation that we have
[1:32:42] to know that whatever covenant god makes
[1:32:45] even with a blinded person he keeps
[1:32:48] praise god
[1:32:49] amen oh my honey if god ever gave a
[1:32:52] promise
[1:32:53] and somebody is able to accept that
[1:32:55] promise god is going to keep his side of
[1:32:57] the bargain praise god
[1:32:59] amen hallelujah
[1:33:02] thank god even though it's not his
[1:33:04] current covenant
[1:33:05] they're blinded to his current better
[1:33:07] promises
[1:33:09] he he accepts them when they live under
[1:33:11] the old covenant
[1:33:13] because every word of god is yea and
[1:33:16] amen
[1:33:18] hallelujah let's bow our heads for a
[1:33:19] moment musician musician you can come
[1:33:22] thank you lydia for helping out with
[1:33:23] chad
[1:33:27] church if god has shelter for jews that
[1:33:30] don't recognize the blood of jesus
[1:33:31] christ
[1:33:32] how many are thankful that there's a
[1:33:33] shelter for you as well
[1:33:36] you're above that altar somehow there's
[1:33:38] altar in heaven
[1:33:40] we're above that they're below the altar
[1:33:44] they're looking up to that but we're
[1:33:46] above that
[1:33:48] in other words we've already benefited
[1:33:51] from the effects of that altar
[1:33:53] we recognized it we we accepted it we
[1:33:56] believed in it
[1:33:57] we didn't speak against it right the
[1:33:59] jews speak against jesus they don't
[1:34:00] believe he's the messiah
[1:34:02] but yet god in this mercy has a place of
[1:34:05] rest for them
[1:34:07] praise god
[1:34:11] and let me just say this too if they can
[1:34:14] cry out and be heard
[1:34:16] with a loud voice and they they didn't
[1:34:19] even
[1:34:19] accept the blood of christ during their
[1:34:21] life do you think god will hear us if we
[1:34:23] cry out loudly
[1:34:25] praise god and we know who's in heaven
[1:34:28] we know who the high priest is we know
[1:34:31] the way to worship it's repent right
[1:34:33] because without
[1:34:33] unless you repent god's not going to
[1:34:35] hear our prayers we know the way to get
[1:34:37] the blessing back on us praise god
[1:34:39] if we backslidden and we feel cursed or
[1:34:41] we we accept the box of rattlesnakes we
[1:34:43] know the way back right it's
[1:34:45] very clear through repentance
[1:34:50] so let's take a moment and let's talk to
[1:34:52] the lord today you don't got to be loud
[1:34:54] the beautiful thing is the bible says be
[1:34:56] still and know that i am god
[1:34:58] you can be still you can whisper like
[1:35:00] hannah you can whisper that prayer
[1:35:02] or you can just mouth the prayer be
[1:35:04] merciful to me
[1:35:05] god i've fallen short of your glory god
[1:35:07] i've really failed this week or god
[1:35:08] what whatever prayer the grace of god is
[1:35:11] there to meet it praise god let's pray
[1:35:14] tonight heavenly father
