stumble the sisters was a brother today by the grace of God praise the Lord God Almighty for that hey man I don't want to be a hindrance or rebuke to anyone mighty John Graham good to see you soldiers amen where we're gonna set up by God's grace I have a little PowerPoint one of the things I shared over in Thailand when I was there um two weeks ago probably the longest trip I've taken is about two and a half weeks and saints of God there's so much work to be done in these fields where the harvester is where the laborers please keep me in prayer I'm praying now and believing maybe a little had me go for a couple months at a time over there will suit the Lord leads what he'll allow financially even though it's 33 baht to one dollar but travel places to stay food you got to take care of the interpret it's very expensive not really too bad but it's expensive for about two and a half weeks there I spent about $1,500 just cash just getting train rides of Chiang Mai you know train ride back we had to pay for gas we didn't even rent a car some of the Saints that have that took us into their house or not really into their house but we fellowship with they paid our meals many times so we able to save on that but one thing for certain Saints we ran into a lot of people who are unbelievers but if you just love on them show that you're concerned about them that you're here to help that makes the world a difference I'd won over quite a few that over in Chiangmai three or four that men older men that said please Simon don't leave me because I like being around you if you make me happy you know but it's just the love of Christ it's not me but it is him pushing out of us to love others too to display the care I ran into one man his name is brother lek he's 68 years I'm sorry 78 years old he came back he was in San Francisco for many years and he run big businessman very shrewd he told me some of the stories you know how to make money you know how to undercut the other with the little guy or the it was the big guy he's very sharp in business and he said Simon he goes when I was younger he said I thought money could buy anything happiness and this than that and then 17 years ago his the Lord took his wife and he had small children at the time and he battled it tremendously with that he started realizing the money really didn't mean a whole lot and after two days I'd pretty much want him to at least the love and fellowship and his and he went over to the kitchen and he took a little knife he said Simon he's take this knife he says cut me right here he says and fix my heart right now he said you're right now and he was not playing games he says please fix this I said brother leg I said it's a spiritual thing he said let's pretend he's a Simon he says forget he can he's a bonus he says forget Buddha he failed forget Jesus he says how do I fix this I said it's impossible I said let me give you example brother luck he's okay I said let's pretend were strangers in a foreign land and in the bush in the swamps and the rainforests I said and we stumble upon a tribe of people that have never been discovered before that have never had communication with the outside world or modern man I said and let's say we make friends with due to your smile or whatever charisma or the grace of God upon us they don't eat us alive I said let's say we were able to spend one week with him he said yeah I said I guarantee you brother link they worship something and he changed the subject right away because he was getting to the point they say that within every man and woman's heart there's there is a desire to worship some thing I said brother like where does that come from I said the only one that can fix your heart is Jesus Christ because that's what fixed my heart that is it amen so we had many successes without waiting it to preach as many churches but one on one we did just as much only two or three of the days there did we not so see don't say it like that so by the grace of God we did our best keeping keeping prayer the the last day were there I did get to meet with the I got to meet with one of the heads of the Full Gospel businessmen and from Thailand and he said brother Simon you know brother Randy actually got to come with me this time so was a real blessing people were blown away by his voice they might understand a word he said but man his voice is like angel food to them many invites to come back to have concerts she's had so we're gonna see what's happened there we'll use those concerts strategically by having a little maybe mystery Expo afterwards and use his voice use him as bait to get him to the hook so keep us in prayer brother Randy he wasn't he was a little nervous their first four days and he was ready to go but now he's ready to go back join into the battles so the last day we met with one of the Full Gospel businessmen and he said brother Simon now tell me your mission for Thailand what's the problems here you see I mean why you even here I said first of all I said these and I was just pretty blunt with them I don't care it's my last day the rapture get took place the very next day or on the plane you know I said first of all I said these these uh Thailand Christians are taught just milk if that I said they all say no it was grace and love your brother and just do right that's it he's like what do you mean I said well I started I said I said broke down in Hebrews five and six showing how that anyone that uses milk is unskillful with the word of God he's what it takes the meat of the word he says for the full aged he's like okay and I started working with the the table of shewbread and how there's 12 loaves and I said I said in the New Testament there's 12 there's 12 mysteries and he's like he was blown away and once we started hitting that and then I had his full attention and I said you want me to break down one of those mysteries he's like yes and I started the Lord led me right to Romans I'm sorry revelation 17 18 just by just by just off the top your head you break down these mysteries who the great is and he was just like Simon that's exactly what we need to know he said he says in Thailand in the government in the in the laws Christianity and the Catholic Church are one in the same there is no difference so they're thought of is exactly the same he said now well he goes now what about the ho Jehovah's Witnesses I said they're totally Antichrist he goes no show me show me show me like I taught the last time I was here I said show me salvation in the name is your hope there is no salvation in name of Jehovah none if you look at the set the seven compound redemptive name is Jehovah salvation is not included in Jehovah and that's why there had to be a name upgrade to what Jesus Christ right Jehovah save you because they'll say very salvation is now broken down and he just going he had never heard these things you know things that we take for common in a secondhand or how we want to say it things we take for granted and by the end of that he's a Simon he goes I see your full desire and I understand he goes these are as my people need to hear these mysteries he says I'm connected with the three biggest churches in Thailand he says thousands of people he's and I want aligned you up brother Randy I said brother Randy Singh I made him sing every time I said I'm running the show here your city and my you know about halfway three humbled himself I said I started calling them gifts and I started I said these are not gifts my said brother these are weapons I said use your weapon that harp the david was a weapon it ran them demons off song i said use your weapon and he's saying and that full gospel businessman sat on his chair like this and he belt that he did knelt down like this and by the time brother Randy was done he come up and he was crying and he said he says I'll give you a full support he said just let me know when you come back so we need to come back as soon as possible I did meet up with three of those four from the last trip and it happened to be on the last day as well because the one sister did not come back from or is like Taiwan till that day and she by the grace of God let me come back to see her brother a was there such a blessed it was just a tremendous time she says brother Simon the only thing I don't like about you is you only give me one day I said sister Joanne the next time I come I'll give and give you three days in a row we're gonna have just word word word for three days she said thank you so there's hungry people those four we're going to that big big big church for the pastor head over fifty churches they are now run out of that church now those some for some reason those three or four were run out so now they go to attend nowhere so I really believe this is the season to get back there brother Ron is coming back we were the forerunners to brother Ron he's going next Friday for ten days hopefully we have a shy man we have a pastor I made brother Randy preach and sing that night and the pastor is sitting there but Randy doesn't what are we hitting reading baptism we're getting people to the promised Holy Ghost and the pastor he's a Baptist minister he goes and his eye is mouth kind of kicks over like this it still I've never heard anything like that in my life you know speak a little English okay he's like please let me study on pre on this really I'm sincere all right you know and by the last day he called back for brother and II talked to him and he said give me more scripture and I started feeding araignee scriptures I said Romans six and then once he hit Romans six he says it was over he said when how do I get rebaptised I said brother wait just a couple weeks we got a minister coming from Canada to come so there is a pastor in his flock he says he's gonna be baptized everybody in Shanghai so we're doing our best it's just a lot of time you need you first of all you have to have a very very good interpreter and we had the best sister Esther one of the few only Thai believers of the message and I told her I'll try to kidnap her when we get but go back in August her daughter we did get to meet with her daughter do many Bible stays with her and her and her daughter's name is mint and mints father we got to meet him and do Bible stays with him and if we just if you just love people Saints put them first in every action open the doors for him do everything you can form by the grace of God just those natural things win them over he paid for every one of our suppers every one of our lunches by the grace of God yes for last about God you wanted to understand God who is Jesus who's the foul or he wanted to know those things we taught the best we could made him clear as simple as we could so anyhow let's get on to what we have for this morning I did teach this in Thailand many times because a lot of times the BIOS doesn't make in the book of Judah says sometimes you got to make a difference and then sometimes you got saving by fear so I tried to hit him a little bit with fear when we did get to office to services offered I had brother Randy preach first and then he usually had baptism or the Holy Ghost whatever and then I came with this so we're trying to win we're trying to do you're just trying to move the people somehow emotionally do something to strike their souls by the grace of God keep my wife in prayer I sent her on a vacation while I was gone to kind of keep her mind off things and either a little bit than the very last day the devil attacked and she fell in the shower and kind little hurt her neck pretty bad so we've been battling that by the grace of God so keep her in prayer turn to Matthew 24 verse 1 this might be some review but at the end I want to hit some prophecies things showing just how very close we are Matthew 24 verse 1 says then Jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple and Jesus said unto them see ye not all these things really saying to you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down verse 3 and he said upon the Mount of Olives and the disciples came and him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world yes and verse 4 and Jesus answers and take heed that no man deceive us a word of Prayer our hands Deerling father Lord Jesus we just love you Lord every time get called to this little pulpit here Lord we feel humble err and tinier and tinier Lord and know just we just want to yield to your folia so just being this little study here that would be a blessing to the people god it may be may we always refocus every day God maybe refocus every time we come to the house of God Lord and our prayer closets and our lives Lord checking up our lean Lord minute lead or God ready for your coming Lord we want to be watching and waiting for please help us so we love you so much Lord bless us so study bless every soul to push their way out Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen have your seats the way the Shanghai we took the night train and if I had to make a little remark the night train is the right train okay if you ever go to Chiang Mai from Bangkok go on the night train it is a beautiful ride but we're able to let me tell you something Saints the Word of God is still continually opening yes Oh sister Esther had brought in one of her friend's sister pawn and she was really enjoyed the teachings she's even started letting her hair grow now and she's wearing dress holy sister mint has let her hair fully grown and she's wearing dresses full time now he's playing tennis if she's coming but as we did the study their sister pawn wanted a Bible study on the my night train so on night train right before we go to sleep we we did a lot of libel study with her and I did Mount Transfiguration study you may have been through it many times but even that opened up again to us in second Peter 1 it talks about how st. Peter said he says bless you sister st. Peter said he said he says and we were made eyewitnesses of his majesty he says and he revealed what his power and his coming right and we can show you the coming it's 7 Jesus weight in 7 days and about the eighth day right he took them up in the high mountain Amy was transfigured right and the thought was always in the back of my mind I never even said it out loud I just thought here there but what is his power what is his power because Jesus cuz Peter said he's as Jesus revealed his power and his coming what is the power and then it opened up right there on the train sister Esther was going brother and he's like that's very good if you look at Romans 10 at the time of his descending as the seven thunders uttered their voices yes and we're to eat the book once again the very next chapter after the head in revelations 11 it says Jesus said while he says and I will give power or he says to my two witnesses and I'm out Transfiguration Moses and Elijah were both the writers day and he said I'll give them power he says too true to the strike and plagues upon the earth to turn the water into blood all these things right there and now we opened up things continually opening you know opening and opening more revelation this is so solid the stress was going I said this was not for me this was for you this was fresh on the spot on the night train reeling what that power represented the power will be with the two prophets Moses and Elijah oh praise be to God I want to share that nugget with you so you got back up now you can teach that thing prove everything is proven it's just totally perfect there was no doubts anymore no doubts long gone this morning if I could teach on something it would be on God's time peace by His grace if I can get this little thing here we go looking at the timepiece we want to deal with God's timepiece right we know God's timepieces but we're gonna deal with a couple of prophecies we're gonna show you some things by the grace of God most of it maybe review some things but we want to reiterate this continually we want to show the coming of the Lord how close are we Saints we want to be sure on these things now here in Matthew 24 verse 36 just down the way from we started what shall be the sign of his coming when shall these things be and the end of the world right we're at the very end Jesus says in verse 36 he says one of the day and the hour knoweth no man he says no not the angels of heaven he says but my father only right when the coming of the Lord is what is the day of the hour we don't know right he says in Matthew 24 verse 42 he says watch therefore he says for you know not what hour your Lord does come this is a warning 2000 years ago how close are we to the coming of the Lord you know in Thailand they're the ones who actually originated almost i from what they are saying the transgender movement over 15 percent of the population now are moving there we went to a restaurant the Mint's Dan took us to a very nice restaurant and I walked in and there was all these girls listen and I said but lon and the girl said hello with a deep voice and I go what sure enough it was a man you look at the hands the hands hands don't lie they call them ladyboys so shall it be in the days of the coming of the Son of Man it shall be like what last day this is beyond that oh my goodness we're seeing stuff they can only imagine about watch therefore for you know not why your hour doesn't come right now here in Matthew 25 after what the parable the wise and foolish virgin he says watch therefore you know not neither did the day nor the hour and the son of man cometh then a Luke 12 verse 46 the land of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him in an hour when he's not aware he says and will cut him asunder and will put and they will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers even though this is a believer this is foolish virgin this is the one that gave a couple of waters for the bride oh my he says and he will be with the porter his portion will be with what the unbelievers if we miss this rapture what will these unbelievers will have every demon on them every lust of the flesh every evil desire will be performed through these unbelievers and here's a foolish version we caught right in the mixed killed tortured they'll have to be a martyrs because they rejected the blood of Jesus Christ and ought to shed their own blood yes doesn't look like much hope we don't know when the coming is when is is coming how close are we to the rapture but rest assured st. Paul the first church a messenger says peace is but in times and season brethren you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day and the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night my goodness he says because we don't know when but he brings us some reassurance he says but ye brethren are not in darkness hey man he says that the day should overtake you as a thief he says ye are the children of light a man praising to God he's in the children of the day he says we are not of the night nor of the darkness therefore let us not sleep as other news but let us be watches and be sober saints of God the coaming of the Lord he says we will know that season absolutely why because we're not in darkness no sir we are in the light not only do the wise virgins have left but they have oil in their vessels as well amen they're packing everything they need and when the food's worse as lamps go out now they'll be in darkness and they'll be kind of thunder with the unbelievers God's timepiece what does God's timepiece we know these things right we're we've been in this word for a long time amen Israel is God's timepiece he says if you don't want to know what time it is on God's prophetic time schedule he says just keep your eyes on Israel and we are one of the few generations that actually hasn't been able to watch them right now we'll run through some things by God's grace I don't want to keep you too long this morning we have seconds service and Deuteronomy 4 verse 37 he says and me and because he loved thy father's therefore he chose their seed after them as choosing Israel's a church nation a national church an entire nation that what is actually a church I can't even imagine what they'd be like where everyone's religious everyone loves God it's just it's just a big group of as a big church house you see my cousin my brothers oh they are in the church because what we're Israelites we're believers amen but notice how he might he chose those people he because he loved my father's oh my Abraham was a gold nugget absolutely the SIL dollar right he says Jacob and Isaac he's they were golden to God absolutely love them with all their hearts he promised him everything he promised in her father's all all the entire world that be inheritance of everything absolutely everything he promised them Abraham took and he received it he was the Bible says he's still not at the promise of God a man that's right surely now look in Deuteronomy 7 verse 6 he says for the hour a holy people and the LORD thy God the LORD thy God hath chosen to be a special people unto himself why because they came out of Abraham they came out of Isaac they came out of Jacob absolutely he's in the Lord did not set upon his love upon no chose you because you were more in number than any people absolutely he did not choose us in this message because we're a great number because but because he loved Peter James and John and Peter James those twelve disciples with Paul included why did why did he love us because he loved our fathers first he promised them everything actually why because they when they were chosen to salvation by what sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth a man coming here believing the truth this morning I absolutely I know I do and I know you do absolutely that's why he chose you and when he's gonna turn our heart slowly back to the Father he's gonna do it he said he would he says even not chose you because you're a more number he says for you were the fewest of all the people he says and because I'm layin London because he would keep the oath that he swore on to your father's a and the Bible said in acts like an axe treason oh the time of restitution amen is where the time of restoration he said he would restore this bride absolutely crazy to God it is going to happen because he said so the Bible says so and he's only as good as his word amen praise be to God absolutely he's faithful he's wonderful only the Lord had to lie to my father's to love them and he chose their seed after them you above all people as unto the state now that was the natural seed saints of God and the seed that Jesus Christ is looking for now is seen if that incorruptible seed which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost where he places himself inside of you and you and you and you and you and he sees that see then he knows that's the sea that we planted one in Peter James and John and porn Philip and Steven and all those saints of God amen one hundred and twentieth the upper room amen praise be to God that's the scene he's looking for now amen absolutely chose Israel the nation but at that time when he chose Israel their nation he was also forced foreshadowing for seeing Jesus and the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the heathen it's not going to be a one Church move saints of God they had many many more seat of God out there amen he says through faith preached the preached before the gospel they were saying in thee shall all nations be blessed who's all nations that's us that's the Gentile bride amen amen praise be to God he says all the ends of the world shall remember him and turn unto the Lord and all the kids our nation shall worship before thee not jesus said what he says I shall not lose one seed he says he says my sheep hear my voice say my name praise be to God now and will be lost that was born of God amen not a one have you given up your family yet I hope not I have not given up o my father yet I'm just speaking them and by the grace of God writings for the rapture you've got to give me the power I think give me the faith I'm just keep speaking and speaking we're just were speaking we're praying we're speaking we're praying so that's what we can do amen he says I the LORD have called the righteous and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for coming on to the people for light of the Gentiles absolutely where the light where would the light strike first what in Israel he says and the Gentiles shall come to thy light us he clubs are our backs killing maiming no law total heathen if we're not Jesse my brother Jesse could have been an Apache warrior catching deer barehanded had God not had this the time we'd be natives over here for sure I don't know what I'll be but didn't have brothers be the older little guy that just jest he gave me some food today's like cheer brother amen sure we count on people like that sure but notice he says now he says in John 1:11 he came unto his own and his own received him not oh my goodness what Jesus Christ the Messiah the the the great prophet he came what to jerk Jerusalem he came to the Jews first and when they were coming when they were there for were come together they asked him saying Lord wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel wasn't time yet he says not for you to know the times of the season which the father has put in his own power right but first God came to Israel first right in Matthew 10 verse 5 in the in the twenties twelve Jesus sent forth command go not into the way of the Gentiles it wasn't our time yet the first coming of Jesus Christ was not to us but it was he says in engineering city of the Samaritans arrey not but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel a man it was to Israel first and Israel own why because he loved the father's Amen now in Matthew 15 verse 24 everybody answered said I am NOT sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel right the first coming the Messiah came to save his own and his own received in that when the saddest stories now look at this a period in a comma now notice what they look at what the definitions of comma one of the places they use a comma for a punctuation mark indicating a pause indicating a pause between the parts of a sentence we've heard this before now it is also used to separate items in a list and to mark a place of thousands he says in large numeral so that period and comma packed strong meaning Saints remember he was sent to the house of Israel first right amen now in Matthew 5 verse 18 various Saints you that head till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled correct now he's God Jesus is dealing now with the little things the tiny little things and now back to the mayonnaise and Gill killing the man age he starts breaking down this jot and tittle the man age Gill I love him he's one of my favorite ones right he says the judge in the Greek language answers to John in the Hebrew and least of all the letters in the alphabet someone the least or tiniest right hence a little city is called by this name and this reason is given for it because the jawed is the least among letters so jesus said even the tiniest little mark in the law the tiniest little mark in the scripture has now look what now look what he was able to dig up in the histories he says he says this shows in what language and what language the law was written not in the Sumerian language Samaritan pieces for the jawed and that is a very large letter but in the Hebrew it is very small pieces and particularly is written very diminutive character by one tittle some think is meant one of these ducks or dashes or quarter lines distinguished one letter from another but in the English English language to English this is they're so much alike he says now these are their little strokes on the top of letters which is U is called crowns or spikes here meant in which they imagined mysteries were contained in a jot or tittle now we're now we're not Hebrew we're not Samaritan but what Scripture what what prophecy now remember dealing with what Christ's first coming would mean is so much better Jesse's picking up on it what could mean a little comma or little doc huh he says in these things they believed or they imagined in the imagination God's God said these little things everything means something he says they imagined great mysteries were contained in it I loved you he must been a big fish it was on him you mean even the name Gill Isaiah 60:1 the spear the lord of the plumy because the Lord has anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that I bow praise be to God he says to proclaim Liberty to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord karma and the day of vengeance of our Lord semicolon to the comfort all that mourn right we know this scripture absolutely now the scripture lay in Isaiah for many many many many many years hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years but now as we go back to Christ's first coming god almighty comes to the Jews and the Jews first right absolutely look here as he starts his ministry in Luke 4 in verse 16 and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Saturday and stood up to read and they has delivered him under the book of the prophet Isaiah right and when he had opened the book notice it takes Jesus Christ to open the mysteries to open the Word of God to you absolutely he has to do the opening and then he picks description and he makes it come the past and he says what this day the scripture is fulfilled he says here open the book and he found in the place where it was written he wrote this he read the specific thing for a purpose correct amen he says now as Jesus picked us up he found the place and Isaiah 61 he says and this here the Lord is upon me because the ears annoy me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to send the libertine that are bruised to preach acceptable year of the Lord and then he switches that comma to earth a period and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them were in the synagogue were passes on him and he began the same thing this day the scripture is fulfilled a man praise be to God right now this was the first coming of Christ we know these things right now notice the difference here's Isaiah 61 and there's your comma legit oh the little jot or tittle but then when I come down the price he fulfilled he stops and he this portion right here he says and the day of vengeance of our God to comfort all the more that was for another age that was for his second coming correct so he only had to fulfill the first coming he says this day the scripture is fulfilled it changes that comma to a period great mysteries are hidden these things and their karma represents thousands in the new world yeah absolutely from Abraham Daniel was about 2,000 years from Laura to Jesus 2,000 years and so far we're on our march to 2,000 years from Christ to the Gentiles raptured up hey man absolutely sure simple graph absolutely got that off the internet praise be to God right now that was his first coming yes sure now we know that when Christ came to his own and his own received him that it was because the Bible says that the Jews were blinded for our sakes if the Jews would have received him right then we would have been lost we would have went to hell we every one of us here would never wouldn't even have been born because it was supposed to stop right and then but at that time there was a 2000 year conjunction that between that period and I comma and he in Jesus Christ fit the Tyl wife right in there hey man that's right sure he says what then Israel has been not ethnic bla obtained that which he which he seeketh for but the election hath obtained it he says and the rest were blinded see what is divine love divine love is election hardest work he we loved him because he first loved us so what does it take if he loved us first what's that love it's agape so the only way we could love him back is with that agape love absolutely see but it takes him first to make a move and then we can receive his love which is the baptism the Holy Ghost and then we can reflect him back to here maybe because we can't even love God right without the Holy Spirit we can't do a thing we're depending on him to love him back whatever whatever what a shame verse 9 and David said let their table be made a snare and a trap and a stumbling block and our events aren't recompense unto them let their eyes be darkened that they may not see him bow down their way down their back always the Jews rejected Christ and they said let his blood be upon us you're blinded for six think God Almighty for that but now the balls in our hands what I'm gonna do with it we gotta go out when some Souls live the very life of God I went onto this jobsite the last four months the very toughest job in 14 years I've had and by the grace of God were able to change the entire atmosphere on that job even even the the superintendent run the job complete Ethan the last day I was there he said yes I'm come here you know he's a cool and I'm cool guys like you need all these light fixtures he got he was he'll see all these he was they're all mine all these all these air returns right here he says he getting all these ones for free he says I can finish my entire basement he's got a twenty six hundred square foot basement all his lights and these ducks he said they're mind he says he owes he owes the Lord blessed that's right exactly exactly right but he's never seen anything like that before but even he knew where that blessing came from he said that's 30 right there laying there he's a $30,000 port and brand-new but he gets used for free we're able to change sing to God just living a little light a little life can change things it moves people it does things to people absolutely even the the nominal Christian that uh befriended me there he goes Simon he goes your lights greater than mine I said no I thought but I just trying to show my I went drove an hour and a half to Elyria did you Bible say with them and tried to show how to get it but it's coming it's coming Romans 11 I say I say then have they stumbled that they should fall god forbid but rather through their through their fall salvation has come unto the Gentiles praise God for to provoke them to jealousy forth the fall be a planet be rich of the world and the diminishing of the rich of the Gentiles how much more their fullness God sent that first messenger he was a Jew to bring it to the Gentiles he pulled from his own people and said boys I want you to lead the Gentile church he would just faint staircase he said Oh crossing-over praise be to God yes Lord now let's keep let's continue on here I want to get to some stuff by the grace of God I hit this real quick Romans 11 if you read this whole chapter Elevens it's all it breaks it all down the branches the the vines all these things he says for if God spared not the natural branches that's Israel Saints he says take heed lest he not also not spared thee every time I get behind here specifically behind a pulpit it's it's a very nerve-racking if you guys knew the mind battles I have everyday I don't know if you don't even feel worthy to be up here you actually feel like you're condemned you feel like a total hypocrite nice peanuts pieces behold there that therefore the goodness and severity of God on them which fell severity but toward thee goodness if thou continue in see look if thou continue not if you receive and be glorious and turn away he says you must continue in the world well cut the promise and he says he says the boy in the church age book he says what he says one of the evidence of the Bedouin goat he says you'll be in the word all the way that's all the way to the end amen and then you don't stop there you go up all the way you've been sold out your lack stocking bare lips your hard done purse I here's a thousand dollars to change doctrine I've already been bought and paid for two thousand years ago it's way too late you come along way too late man so I know there's s o N out there I know his name [Laughter] this is reliable cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature and we're grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree where does it all come from the island tree a man he says how much more shall these beat which be the natural branches be graffed into their own olive tree look not only has the blind of their eyes for our sakes brought us and granted to us in but he's going to restore them as well praise be to God he thought of everything now the one would be lost a man praise be to God now let's continue on by the grace of God I don't want to be too long we want to get give space by the grace of God I want to hit some things here coming up let's see here the Bible says that the rapture is a mystery yes 12 mysteries of New Testament but your pastor was one the first ones to tell me about that I search it out man sure doesn't look right absolutely and the statue perfect man faith virtue all those things moving all right but the base is faith right but look what it takes for mystery here Ephesians 3 1 for this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles for if you heard this the dispensation of grace of god which has given me to you or how that what by revelation what the prophets say he says pray for revelation more than any because if there's any other mystery if there's any other thing the bride must slow for this rapture if there's anything else that you must catch from the mind of god will it take faith no first it must be unveiled what is faith seeing something which is not done or taking place yet seeing something believing for something but you see it already and now you could say i'm looking past when i see right here but i'm seeing the end and now i can have faith on it right but before faith comes it must be revealed it must be open before you can see it spiritually yes he says if you have heard of this position of grace how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery so the mysteries will be made by revelation you must pray for revelation no revealed these things to me what does jeremiah 33:3 he says jesus is an hour show the great things which thou knowest not what but we must ask for them Lord reveal these things to me show me the very key things to make us rest Lord increase my faith and show me how because we ain't missing us we must go up my goodness how the revelation he may know known unto me the mystery what has this day been nothing but a day of Revelation opening of the Word of God a restoration all these things saying to God what we understand and know now is light-years beyond them 99% of the people who's ever lived in my entire life and yet we can't even seem to make it work it seems we came in and we can't even walk in half the time because the abundance of the mind battles the amount of sin in this fresh the temptations the worldly easy living hi yes have mercy on us right now let's continue on I won't hear some I want to hear some things here by the grace of God some a couple of things here at the end now back to this he says tell us Matthew 24 what tell us then what shall be these things be and shall be the sign of thy coming in the end of the world right and we know that Israel's God's timepiece correct now we're these all this might be a little repetition for you in verse 21 he says for there shall be great tribulation notice tribute the tribulation is encased in Matthew 24 he says shall neither be since the beginning of the world to this time no ever shall be and except those days should be shortened now we're getting the bride time he says there shall be no flesh saved but for the elects sake he says those days shall be shortened so what he's saying is the truth the great revelation should strike first first before it should have but because God actually holds back the full wrath of God until that Brides caught up in rapture because the very elect a he says Shelly says where he says he's going to have those days fall short so the rapture the Great Tribulation is all in this but also the great deception for there shall arise false Christ's false anointed ones saints of God we appreciate a church in Thailand they told rejected quite a few things but they've had six people healed of AIDS when you they had a prayer line I mean for the rainy but praying you touch them like this brother you just go like this for three seconds and they fall back because they've been trained that way all the power guns and then two seconds I'm looking at them and they get right back up false anointed ones not trying to call anyone anything but you got to watch these things that didn't if you're slaying the spirit you are slain you'll get up on the spirit bade you get up when he's done with you you'll get up there falling 20 at a time Bam Bam I felt like billion benny hinn no I mean I'm not joking I'm not even joking there that's just what happens you're just boom down down down down what in the world is going on be worried like just keep praying and then I stopped I said sister Esther let me know what this one next one once and then he started doing that way I want my family I want them 14 boys stuck in the cave okay now we have something to go for we started praying like that way I said just ran them and they fall down and he said there shall arise false Christ's and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if they if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect it look what so in case to Matthew 24 the great tribulation the rapture and the great deception right yes but also at the end here God gives the great timepiece right here he says all these things he says look he says I'm gonna show you something right here right you know we've been through this correct verse 32 now learn a parable of the fig tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves you know that summer is nice notice what leaves not fruit first but leaves what life is now entered in what is springtime the time of life come back what into the fig tree and now she's starting to bloom a man so likewise ye when ye shall see these things know that is near what the tribulation the rapture what the great deception he says even at the doors releasing you this generation shall not pass till all things be fulfilled now we're gonna hit some stuff here okay everybody know who the fig tree is yes the fig tree is Israel Christ first ministry he was a hungered he went to the fig tree no figs on it no fruit only leaves he lookin for it he curses it and the leaves wither correctly sure how soon is the fig tree withered it was prophesying of Israel correct absolutely now back to Jeremiah chapter 8 if you read this he says why is this people of Jerusalem slipping back by perpetual backsliding they hold fast the seat they refused to return reading old chap 3 is dealing with Israel right but now in verse 12 he says were they ashamed when they committed abomination nay they were not ashamed at all neither could they blush therefore shall they fall among them that fall well if they fell it for our sakes they were blinded for us correct in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down say 'then or what is it when God manifests himself in the flesh when he came to his own his own received him not he's talking about the first coming of Jesus Christ correct he says almost surely consumed them he did what 70 AD they were banished for 2,000 years there shall be no grapes on the vine absolutely because what we weren't even savable then he says no figs on the fig tree see when he come to them and the leaf shall fade and I did notice there was no fruit no things but he cursed him to die what is Israel he says and the things that I haven't given them shall pass away from now remember what I taught on the forfeiting of seven church ages that's exactly right that's exactly right they forfeited everything we've had how many healings take place in Israel every day God a mercy a church and doesn't leave this message as six people healed of AIDS because of the blessings of Jesus Christ when we received him by the grace of God we received him all of him Israel is that fig tree oh sorry let's get to this I'm working the left handed here Israel the State of Israel is born says May 14 1948 he says when you see that fig tree blooming leaves shooting forth life has come back into Israel into the fig tree she's alive again where are we the great tribulation the rapture the great deceptions that Jesus said what that generation shall not pass till all things be fulfilled our great president was born in 46 47 that generation will not pass right Song of Solomon 2 verse 10 my beloved spake and he said to rise up my love my fair one come away below the winners past he says the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on earth when it's springtime he says the time of singing of the birds is coming the voice of the turtle is heard in the land oh my it's spring time love time Christ is coming for his wine when was the ones a message what was the Commission the Prophet 4647 right right around that time the exact same time he's coming now to his bride and he's reviving that fig tree at the same time the hand of Almighty God who could do that none but Jesus not one you wait to this you wait to this final revelations come here in this message what was mouth transfer what it ended up one mount transfiguration end up one they saw no save Jesus alone there is no one gonna have any glory there is no one that's gonna have to take any credit it is gonna be Jesus our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and that alone hey my Lord willing we come back we'll hit that in August here he says the fig tree put it forth her green figs oh oh it's beyond leaves now Saints time must have way old from spring to summer what does the summer summer actually produce is now the fruit but what it for was when the harvest time because rubber Jesus Christ is coming back for two harvests he harnesses the bride and he comes back for the Jews as well back to back to quitting spoofs and done it's like an eagle two legs the fig tree putteth forth the green figs and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell oh my there we are he says arise my love my fair one and come away a man the rapture the the Israel right there brother Jesse you did you just preach on the song song a while back have you did been a few years okay now let's get to where we're going I want to kind of skip this we've been through these when hit some one has some prosti Saints here we go from 1679 now some of this I too understand but if you catch what the Spirit is saying through this lady we just found this this was just sent to me about a month ago month and a half two months maybe prophecy by Jane lead of England 1679 okay let's read this because this is a there's a setting she's showing things right here there will be a total in full Redemption by Jesus Christ this is a mystery revealed by the Holy Spirit oh Lynch and those holy seekers who love willing search for truth the CEOs in the book of Revelation represent the completion of this redemption how'd she know that or was she not speaking but the fulfillment is being held back at the present time 1679 right as God's Spirit opens seal after sealed those truth-loving holy seekers praise be to God I hope you can represent yourself in there somewhere this complete and total Redemption will be revealed both individually and universally this gradual opening of the mysteries of God's redemptive redemption constitutes guys unfathomable wisdom and will continue reveal new and fresh things to the deserving seeker don't you see this thing will never get old it's going to open open on the night side we're gonna see the ball open up he continually opens what what is saying in Matthew 13 he says the describe he says the household he says he filled it new and old things new and the old amen he says he said it's continually open up this gradual opening of the mystery of Christ's Redemption constitutes of God's own family wisdom and will continue to reveal new and fresh things to the to the deserving seeker because now we're what in the we're in the holiest of Holies now here's what I don't understand forward the reason for the opening of testimony and heaven before the end of the ages so that the Ark of the living testimony contains may be unsealed take with a grain of salt could be revelations 15 that's kind of one thing the presence of divine Ark will constitute the life of the Virgin Church and whatever this church body is the arts art must also be the spreading of the everlasting gospel the kingdom will begin with the unsealing of the living testimony in God's Ark okay the proclamations from this testimony will be to the sounding of the trumpet of alarm to the nations of Christendom Christ will give authority to end all controversies concerning the true church and then this is going to happen he's going to finish this by the time this rapture takes place there will be no doubt who Jesus Christ is because remember what does the Book of Revelations is the title the Book of Revelations or is it the revelation of Jesus Christ maybe there has to be an unfolding of who Jesus Christ is he says he says to end all controversies concerning the true church which is born from new mother this decision will be the actual sealing of Christ Church body with God's name nature and authority commissioned her to act in that name now look what she says now this new name or nature or authority will distinguish her from the seven thousand names of Babylon sounds like revelations two and three there's a new name promised the selection and preparations were churches to be after a secret or hidden manner what does the Holy Ghost what Jesus st. John three says he comes like the wind you don't know where it's coming where it goes amen but he fails who will be failed absolutely hey man as David was chosen chosen and anointed by God is the Lord's prophet but was not admitted to public service in the kingdom for quite a few years he says so awesome the Virgin Church which has no human origins and who is also from the stem of David will be born it will take her some time to come out of immaturity it's been 50 years as the prophets been on the sea it will take some time to come out of immaturity and arrive at full of mature age are you reading this my goodness we're there now let's go on I won't hit this it's a long one but here are something hit the mighty spirit of Cyrus the mighty spirit of science is appointed to lay the foundation of this third temple and support it during the construction right the mighty spirit of Cyrus right who is Cyrus Cyrus was the medial Persian King I believe that gave the Jews said go rebuild that temple right he was a Gentile King right there's a scripture 2nd chronicles 36 22 touched by Isaiah 44 now why did that strike me so much because last Israel minted a coin Cyrus Trump 100-year anniversary there's King Cyrus right there his profile and Trump's is over him the mighty spirit of Cyrus will be upon this world for what the rebuilding of the third temple and on the back of the coin is the third temple that generation shall not pass to all things be fulfilled I talked to a brother today he's on Facebook a little bit he says already on Facebook they're saying Trump's daughter is talking about her for president won't fulfill the six vision could be the Catholic Church it could be a natural man but man she'd fit it there's one prophecy right there okay there they coined this that Israel okayed that he's a deal maker yeah remember this one 1937 Joel Brandt stream hit his head right riding a horse his head when divisions coma-like stuff right before LA falls into the ocean San Francisco flips on top of itself right he says I wonder what he here was it certainly was not 1937 I saw a newspaper on the corner with a preacher of the president it surely wasn't mr. Roosevelt he says he was bigger heavier big ears if it was in 1937 he says I wondered what year it was now we're just taking this with a grain of salt but we're looking at some dimensions here Franklin Delano Roosevelt six-foot to 173 pounds 6 foot 3 236 uh-huh take with a grain of salt we're getting closer things are getting closer now one more thing I want to show you by the grace of God one more prophecy right here we're getting close Saints we were getting so very close this year has been a transformation here for me many many battles it's been the second hardest year since my 33rd year 33rd year was off the charts this was right up there with it not quite as bad but revelations 3 verse 10 because thou has kept the word of my patience I will also keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth this is to the fees and churches correct sure yeah now the exposition of 7 Church ages our prophet from 1965 another prophecy look what he's dealing with here he says now I will keep me from the eye of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth what leading what there's a temptation and then the Great Tribulation right this verse is not a declaration that the true church will go into and through the tribulation if it meant that it would have said that but it said I will keep thee from the hour of temptation right amen this temptation is exactly like the temptation in Eden it will be a very inviting preposition to held up in direct opposition to God's command and word and yet from the standpoint and we're going to see this and from the standpoint of human reasoning he says seer he says it will be so very right so enlightening and life-giving as to fool the world right so whatever is coming is gonna be so sick zoomy sounded so good it's gonna feel just so right right there's a forerunner to this to this great thing it's already happened four years ago okay I'm gonna show it to you now look what here now he continued on only the very elect will not be full right there he goes right back to Matthew 24 twenty-four correct the temptation will come as follows he's giving us a preview he's giving us hints and clues on how to detect this temptation and to reject his temptation say sure you look crazy because it sounds so nice come on brother let's just be one the ANCA miracle notice it's a religious move we'll move the well that has started on what seems such a beautiful and blessed principle were they gonna get this they're getting it from the Bible they're not gonna get it from the Bible they're gonna get from the New Testament that from just a New Testament but they're getting it from the Riddler's where they poor notice the Prophet did not put the scripture in but by the Word of God we obviously know where it comes from here in John 17 verse 21 now let's read this write pieces that they may all be one Christ is now Judas is off the scene and now Christ was really himself insuring how the church is going to be he said that we all be one he's his father our than me and I need that they may also be worn in us now why why does he wanted to come the oneness because that the world may believe that thou has sent me so the only way that the world is going to under the only way the world's gonna believe that the Jesus is real is if we come to one thinks of god we gotta fulfill his prophecy if we could just make this prophecy fulfilled they're gonna believe the whole will be converted and the glory which thou gave us me well now when this happens we're gonna get glory I have given them that they may be one even as we are one they're gonna pull from this scripture right there fulfilling Christ's prayer that we all might be one become so politically strong are we there yet we're getting there that she bears pressure upon the government to cause all to join with her either directly or through inheritance two principles enacted into law so that no people will be recognized as a short churches see it's a religious move the mark of the beast is a religious mode unless under the direct or indirect domination domination the sitting the woman that sits of this council little grooves for those charters privileges etc until they lose all property property and spiritual rights with the people has this already started I got the video brother Malachi is this things plugged in hopefully this'll I have a little clip of video I want to show you this has already started four years ago okay you may have already be aware of this but I want to play it for you if we can get this to go I don't know okay hold on here let me see sorry if this is taking a little here we go I thinks okay we're there let's try this [Music] mines up all the way brother Jess unless you can find we will serve for the I'm not a master computer guy I'm just happy to have won praise Lord thank God me bless his heart let me let me tell me award division destroys our credibility it is a sorry and Nikita is decorated because fear is false evidence appearing real connection ok let's restart here by the grief sad thing sister Wendy let's play what there now look how smooth this sounds thank you for the loris the Lord will give you a gold star definitely be a blip bless you that's all Batman he came through Jesus the glory was the presence of death what does the carries medical yield is when we experience the presence of God and he said and I give them the glory cognatic means them so that they may be one it's the glory that glues us together not the doctors to see her glory if you accept that Christ is living in me and the presence of God is in me and the presence of God is in you that's all we need because God will start out all our doctors we get upstairs there for Christian unity is the basis of our credibility because jesus said until they won they will be company the world will not believe as they should and so we are one division destroys our credibility it is fear that keeps is decorated because fear is false evidence appearing real it's an acronym f.e.a.r false evidence appearing real because most of your fear is based on propaganda now why is it historic because in 1999 the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant Lutheran Church signed an agreement that brought an end to the protests Luther believed that we were saved by grace through faith alone amen but the Catholic Church believed that we were saved by works and that was the protest 1999 they wrote this together because in the Protestant church there are the chief salvations people who are getting born again but nothing whatsoever and because we didn't even look for fruits it wasn't issued but there wasn't sorry for salvation and no it's not but it's a good journey few are saved so what these two churches do is they put the two definitions together listen to I'm reading verbatim from the Catholic Mexican website justification means that Christ Himself is our righteousness in which we share through the Holy Spirit in accord with the will of the Father together we Catholics and Protestants Lutheran's believe and confess that by grace alone in faith in Christ's saving works and not because of any merit on our part we are accepted by God and receive the Holy Spirit the renews our hearts while a putting and calling us to this work an end to the protests of luth their brothers and sisters Luther's protest is over is yours in 1999's resigns by the Lutheran Church the Federation worldwide later but five years later the worldwide Methodists signed the same agreement but as of today we still have had no Protestant evangelical that will stand up and sign this agreement to agree with our brothers and sisters that we are saved by grace through faith to good works they're not bound yet there's a challenge for you the the protest has been over for fifteen years and I could get a bit cheeky here because I challenge my Protestant foster friends if there is no more protest how can they be a Protestant church maybe we now we're all Catholics again but rarely fathers be a Catholic in the universal sense we are not protesting the doctrine of salvation by the Catholic Church anymore we now preach the same gospel we now preach you're saved by grace through faith alone the word alone what the argument for five languages the word alone is mad you can read it yourself the protest is over the protest is over so let me pray and then we'll start the video I believe we will begin to see more and more people called out to go into the world and work among the churches in the script of Elijah to turn the hearts of the father's to the children and the hearts of the children to the father's to make ready a people prepared for the Lord ministries of reconciliation we need to throw as much resources and energy into the Ministry of reconciliation as we do to the Ministry of evangelization are we building walls without foundation I challenge you to find a bridge builder and back in and I'd like to pray just pray if you agree you can say Amen what's this prayer does a dying man's prayer when you know you're about to die you certainly pray the most important prayer he said I do not pray for these of them but also for those who will believe in me through their work and they all may be one as you Father are in me dying in you they may also be one enough so that the world may believe that you sent me and the glory which you have given me I have given them that they may be one saints of God he pulled from John 17 just exactly like the prop was said in 1965 in the church age book this is not and then he he plays the message from the Pope there but before that he said I'm coming in the spirit and power of a life of Malachi 4 of Elijah within one year he was dead he's already dead well you see how this moved then that sounds so nice but he forgot that Luther Knight nailed 95 they fixed one what about the other 94 pretty slick what was that that was a group of pastors he called the interdenominational pastors meeting evangelical meeting to join up with the Lutheran's and the Methodists and the Catholics already signed the document four years ago and it's still not with political pressure yet when what Jesus say Matthew 13 verse 27 so the servants of the householder came and said of him served in us now not so good seed in thy field from when staff that then tears and he said to him an enemy has done this the servants entered him wilt thou then go then we go and gathered him up but he said nay less while they gather up the tares ye root up also to eat the wheat with them let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of the harvest I'll say to the Reapers he says gather ye together first the tares the tares must be bound first what are the tears the false churches underneath the Catholic Church what he's saying Matt in Revelations two or three says and I will kill her children with death but what is first I must bound the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn saints of God were very close he may stand to read one last quote by the grace of God he says now this is exactly what John the Baptist and Jesus said for John said that the wheat would be guarded and the chaff burned Jesus said buying the tares and then gather the wheat the ekam única move will bind the tares churches together for the tares must be bound first and though their end is burning they are not burned at their binding but it reserved to a later date he says which is at the end of the thousand years or the second resurrection but once the tares are bound the rapture can take place and so and does so at the time sometime between the binding and the revelation of the Antichrist and they're binding each other that that thing was made back in 1999 when I got out of college fifteen years ago and that was four years ago when he said this how much closer the churches together now where should the message churches be where should they should the holy ghost speak in controlling our churches yes should they be controlling every meeting should they be controlling every pastor every member of the body of Christ absolutely yes but like that prophecy said he says it'll take a little bit of time to get the bride mature the break had had a maturity of a young life but when she's ready Christ will come and sweep away and take her away by God's grace let's bow our heads during the father Lord Jesus we just love
