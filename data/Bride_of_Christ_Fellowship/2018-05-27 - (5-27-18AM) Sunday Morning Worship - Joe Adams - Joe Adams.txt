come with an expectation in your heart I need God's here and he's able to meet that need this morning before we get into the word though I just do want to say thank you brother Jesse for having us we've kind of been trying to get this data range since I probably November of last year and it finally worked out we had a reschedule and a dent in a family back in February my wife's grandfather passed and then so we rescheduled but we're here we're glad to be here with you we just trusted something to be said that would encourage you this morning if I can get a little bit more volume up here that'd be great and it's good to be back with many of you some of you I know many of you I don't know but it's it's great to see everyone and familiar faces and some that are not so familiar but trusting that through the course of our day and the fellowship in the word this morning we realize that we come from eternity we're going back to the attorney a man if you have your Bibles this morning let's take a take our bow gonna turn to John 14 I want to speak to you I got two thoughts this morning or actually one for this morning one for this evening I want to speak to you on faith that will speak this morning then we're going to turn around this evening by God's grace and we will speak time for you to speak so just trusting something to be said that will encourage you something that will edify you and remember the prophet of God said if you want something out of this service you got to do the puller you got to do you got to expect God you got to ask God you got a you got to get from what you have need of you got to pull it out of the ministry today and so I'm counting on you to pull on the gift of God and I tell you every time I've been in a service and I've seen God move and the people beginning really gonna have that anointing begin to pull God it pulls God right to your need and got a minister to your knee and you'll not go out of here disappointed but well we want to take our time this morning our brother give us our liberty and we just want to take our time to say some things that when encouraging we find here in John 14 and verse 12 the scripture says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me and the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because I go into the Father and whatsoever you ask in my name that will I do that their father may be glorified in the son if you ask anything in my name I will do it I want you to key in on that if you ask anything in my name I will do it now if your Bible reads like mine that's read letters that's not a man's interpretation of the word that's God Almighty as Jesus Christ telling you that if you ask anything in his name he will do it let's look here in first John 5 and verse 14 first John five and verse 14 and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and we know that he hears us whatsoever we ask we know that we had the petitions that we desired of him so if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and we know that he hears us so whatsoever we ask we know that we had the petitions that we desired of him father we just bow our heads to you this morning Lord we want to say thank you for the opportunity to be here to be a symbol with of the believers Lord those of like precious faith father has been many years since we've been here we've seen the growth of the church and we're grateful and thankful father for what you're doing that you have a bride called right here in Akron Ohio we're asking Lord you come by our way and you'd begin to some ministry to us speak to us Lord encourages Lord we just give ourselves to you this morning we asked Lord not only that you'll bless to speak another word but you'll also bless the hearing of the word father may it just be a two-fold purpose Lord that of giving and that of receiving when you give strength to the body Lord strength to the local congregation and we just pray O God that you'll have preeminence in our hearts and have preeminence in this service this morning we've just committed to you now in Jesus name amen you can be seated this morning I'm gonna have to have just a little bit more volume brother Jesse I want to take you to another scripture here in 1st Peter 1 and verse 6 because there speaking on faith this morning faith that will speak we find here in 1st Peter 1:6 says wherein you greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be you're in heaviness through manifold temptations that's a trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that perishes though it be tried with fire might be fell into the praise and honor and the glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ so we notice here that our faith it goes to a try or goes to a season of tests now how many of you love tests I mean not a hand was raised not even you young kids I don't like tests either do you I hated tests in school we don't like tests but we found through the course of the scripture that is the test is not a test of who you are but it's a test of your faith it's a test of what you claim to believe and we love so look in the book of James the Bible tells us in James 1 in verse 2 my brother counting all joy when you fall into divers temptations now there's now so here this morning they goes and coming to church know best to be the name I'm in a trial this morning oh praise God I'm being tested for the glory of God none of you walk in like I know you walk in with the Eeyore complex nobody gives around a bad day and you know you won't everybody feel sorry for you come on human nature is that is how it is but we find here that in book of James says now I brought my brother counting all joy when you fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith work is patience that word patience there's Hoopa mone it is - patience that when you're under heavy load you're not trying to get out of it it's not like sitting at the doctor's office and you're patiently waiting like some of you right here are just patiently waiting like okay great no but this is like somebody who's under a heavy load and he's enduring the load he's and he's not trying to get out from underneath it because he knows he's been tasked with that job he's been given a responsibility and he's not trying to shut the responsibility but he's trying to do all that he can because he's wrong because he is being tested his faith is being tested and the Bible says let patience have her perfect work that you may be entire morning nothing let me tell you Church that's what we want in this hour we don't want to be lacking one thing but he called for a bride to come home we want to be perfect it wasn't going to take to me perfect it's going to take your faith to be tried by the test in the trials that we go through let's not sugarcoat it way this is not a flowery man of ease you will never know your true strength until you've been forced put to the test you'll never know how much fate you really have unless your faith has been put to the fire and when you've been put to the fire everything they sound like God begins to melt away all the just begins to melt away all the impurities begin to fall away you become more like God but it takes the testing and the trying of our faith to bring us to that position and the bring us into that condition not wonder many times I wonder I want to do we fail to realize as a bride of Christ or is it believed do we fail to realize the fate that we have and I believe do they have we can recognize who we are it had faith in who we are then there would be nothing to stand before you you would weather every storm you wouldn't come in dragony church you'd come in rhetoric because your faith is being tested and you know because it's being a test I think God has something in store he's got something greater at the end you better come out more perfect more precious than gold so as I was beginning to study this I'll begin to think why is our faith being tested we can find the answer in the church Facebook we look here in the church age book brother Branham says now remember this that Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts how many of you believe that that Christ in the true church is a continuation not a period but a comma the same things a gun is the same things we do today well brother tell that was 2000 years ago I don't care how long ago was the same works that they did is the same work so we're to continue but the book of Revelation shows how they Antichrist spirit we're coming to the church and defile it make it lukewarm formal and powerless look at what they had on Christ Buddhist trying to do he's trying to get to true church to become lukewarm well you don't care you're not on fire for God you don't read your Bible you're not praying you're not having that time alone with the God with the Lord and making it formal when we come in and we come in we had a noose there's so much formality and we're we're afraid to let our hair down afraid to get in the anointing we're afraid because somebody may look around somebody may walk through the door who cares what anybody else thinks this is your time alone with God this is your time to get your knees man if it takes let your hair down if it takes carnage snug whatever it is it doesn't matter I got a need a good - Jesus Christ anyone relation to church powerless let me tell you we don't need a powerless religion I'm irritated we don't have a powerless religion we got a church this old fire God now the Book of Revelations here he says now it exposes Satan revealing his works now notice his works his attentive destruction of God's people how does he attempt to destroy you by tacking your faith because if he can destroy your faith then he weakens you and if he weak is you you will not fight him back so he's attempt to destroy God's people and the discrediting of God's Word now have we seen an attack on the word today we've seen one after the other has it ever come up rise up after many years walk away from what we call the message of the hour and begin to crucify and begin to make accusations against the messenger just dismiss it let me tell you I know what this measures can produce I know what I used to be I love them desires and I used to have I used to drink I used to woman eyes eyes you all those terrible things and party when I came in with this word with this much I'm no liar the things that introduces brothers they change my life with a law of God in its heart the problem is that there's the attack on the peel the word is because they've never had an experience with the word says they're right down to the time that he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it I want you to notice this is where it gets good yeah saw they thank you he's noted he says he knows referring to sake can I get a little bit more volume I don't know what's going on with my throat where's the monitor system monitor here are you there back there I'm talking out the speakers okay that's fine all right he knows referring to Satan he knows that it took people get a true revelation of the true church listen to him come on stay with me this morning he knows it too people get a true revelation of the true church and what she is where is she bone of his bone flesh of his first power of his power part of his learned she is him and say nose out about you this morning and what she stands for one is his bride stand for she stands for truth she stands for righteousness she stands for holiness she says for purity she stands for modesty she says for everything that is godly that's what she stands for and Satan knows that about you this morning and he knows it all so that she can do the greater works he said that she will be an invincible army so let me just bring this back in he says now Satan knows and put it in Satan knows because he's referring to he knows say knows that if two people get a true revelation the people right here the people this morning get a true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and then she can do the greater works he says that she will be an invincible warming that weren't invisible there means too powerful to be defeated come on somebody I'm talking about you this morning you're too powerful to be defeated this morning and Satan knows that about you see if they get a true revelation of the true spirits within the framework of the Christian Church and by God's Spirit desert and with sin Antichrist spirit Satan will be powerless how many you owe Satan to be powerless this morning they say God give me a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church and help me by your grace discerner withstand antichrist spirit he will be definitely thwarted today as when Christ would suit his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of Hell cannot prevail against us but we come on somebody but we shall prevail over them I know what you're going through this morning but it doesn't matter because we shall prevail over them this morning so we find that our whole Christian experience hinges on faith the Bible says that we're saved by grace but it's through faith and we know that che knows this about you he knows the power that you possess he knows the position that you possess the problem is I'm afraid many times as a believer we fail to understand the power that we have the authority that we have the position that we have God's called you for a holy position has placed you in his power has placed you in his family and there's no general hope is that before you if you can only recognize who you are in this hour so he knows these things about you therefore he attacks your faith that's why your faith is under attack that's why you're going through manifold temptations and trials in situations but if the believer can ever recognize the faith that they have but what the faith that they possess then there'd be no devil of Hell can stand before that believer I don't care if it's cancer I don't care if it's heart trouble I don't you put a name that you put a torment spirit oh it can't stand before that name and if you can discern it withstand Antichrist Satan will be powerless you will be all-powerful he will be defeated you'd be undefeated you'd be triumphant but she attacks her faith he tries to weaken our faith because he knows if he can weaken your faith you have no leg to stand on because you're then you're trembling you're fearful and many times we think we gotta have gigantic faith how many you realize you many times you say well if I had faith like so-and-so faith like brother John Graham fact faith like brother Jessie if I had faith like this brother of that brother if I had faith like brother Branham oh man for a wicked we could create squirrels but the Bible says here in Matthew 13 the kingdom of heaven is like a grain of a mustard seed and brother Jessie I took the liberty to bring some mustard seed out of your office you see that can y'all see that seed right there that's me you kicked my finger was over what do y'all talking about y'all couldn't see that seat I get that line spirit out of here first let me shake it up look at that seed right there you'll see that seed you can't see from the back can you brother John but it's there and sometimes it's like your faith you can't see it but it's there so we find here the Bible says that the kingdom of heaven is like a grain of a mustard seed I took one of these little seeds out this morning I put it on my finger and I snapped a picture up and I said to my wife I said inside of that seed right there is enough power to move mountains if you can only recognize inside of that scene you don't take gigantic faith it takes just a little bit of faith the size of a mustard seed and if you can recognize that particular this morning let me tell you all heavens will move back o demons will move back o torment spirits will move back but that's why are you recognize that it would then me is the faith of the God just a little bit of see little bit of faith this morning can move mountains what about your situation what about what you're going through this morning [Music] see it doesn't take gigantic faith but just a little bit seed right here you plant that seed in the Reich anti-environment you begin to water that CD you're gonna put the right mental sunlight on that see what happens to that seed suddenly begins to crack that outer shell begins to crack but inside of that seed is life and life begins to wiggle up out of the ground it begins to excuse me rise up he grows into a 12 to 15 foot tree inside of that little bitty seed and fowls of the air will come alive in its branches so many times we think we got to have gigantic faith we don't need y'all gettin faith what we need is to plant the faith when we got in this field of God's Word plant the faith that you have in the field of God's Word don't come back there so they digging it up no plant they're expecting that seed to produce life it's not going to lay dormant no it's going to produce life if you plant it with faith believing that whatsoever you ask in his name I will do it so there's been times we've sold seeds of doubt we've sold seeds of unbelief but it's time that we start sowing seeds of faith faith that this word is perfect faith that this message is perfect faith for total healing faith for total deliverance faith for a body change faith for our wedding supper faith for a obtains how do we start tolling those kind of seeds Matthew 17 and verse 20 says now if you have faith as a grain of a mustard seed just a little bit of mustard seed you shall say unto this mountain removed to a yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you Luke 17 and verse 6 if you had faith ever grain as a mustard seed you might say unto the sick of my tree be thou plucked up by the root and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you so we find there's a common theme here if you have faith of a grain of a mustard seed you can speak to a mountain and it's got to move you can speak to a tree as Adam did in the beginning and say be plucked up and be planted over here and the Bible says in mark 9:23 jesus said unto him if thou canst believe or otherwise have faith then all things are possible to him that believeth I'm trying to get it something to you this morning faith that will speak it's time that we have faith too speak things to come in the things that you have needed of Istanbul we ask God and not only ask but expect God to minister and expect God to move and look at the days of God not moving and responding their days go by I'm telling you today God is just as real today as it was 2,000 years ago when he opened the blind I was there he's here this morning and he's really open up blinded eyes ain't Kongsberg and let you come into a greater revelation of who you are in this hour but the Bible says all things are possible to him that believeth and we found here again that we look back into in Matthew 17 and nothing shall be impossible so if you got faith this morning nothing is impossible and all things are possible so what does that tell you is what I tell you that the devil don't have a leg to stand on he's trying to come to your brother you out of it he's trying to taint you're not gonna be who you say you are let me to tell you all things are possible if you can believe this morning and nothing shall be impossible they says hearing the messages they shall be even as it was told me says maybe you might not have spontaneous faith to bring something just a miracle right to you you may not have that kind of faith but jesus said if you had to faith like a mustard seed I'm trying to get something over to you don't take a lot of faith it just takes cheap on faith but if you had a faith the size of a mustard seed you could say to this mountain be mood and by and by it would come to pass it would vanish it away but by and by it would come to pass see the mustard seed he goes you can make scale you can make spinach you can breed it together but you can't mix mustard nothing with it won't mix it's just mustard to be mustard and that's the kind of faith that we need in this hour not a Pentecostal faith it's gonna mix with the world not a presbyterian faith is going to mix with the doctors increase of the world but we need that that's supernatural Holy Ghost feel hey there refuses to mix with the world we're not putting on clothes that pertain to a man or to a woman we're not wearing makeup we're not turning our hair we're not dressing in a way we're not acting the way no we're become the living vessels are living this hour how do you do that by adorning yourself with faith faith gotta believe the word and it may not be spontaneous but nevertheless if it's the size of a mustard seed it will come to pass because if you got just the least little grain of faith that's genuine mustard seed o kick catch a hold of that genuine not mixed with doubt now it mixed with unbelief not based on what somebody else do out I can't believe because so I'm so trusting God and she went by the way in the grave well you know what that's not mixing we're not talking about that but on by a supernatural genuine faith he goes if you can just get a little grain of faith that's genuine mustard seed faith that won't move stay with it it will bring you out come on somebody are you ready to come out at trial that you've been here are you ready to come get delivered and get the victory that you've been longing for just stay with it produce that kind of faith Ginuwine mustard seed bait this morning he says now some people have faith like this some people have that must face some people has that much faith and some people have faith you know plumb over the heads into miracles he says but because you haven't got that much that doesn't mean that you can be healed if you had the least let up now won't you listens at least a little bit of faith just stay right with it he goes it'll take you out will you believe that he goes that's the truth God will make me answer for it if I haven't told you the truth did you hear that I'm gonna say it again he goes just because you haven't got that much that doesn't mean that you can't be healed if you had just a least little bit of faith just stay right with it it'll take you out will you believe that that's the true God will make me answer for it if I haven't told you the truth sohal it takes there's thirty five in here I pulled one out stuck it on my finger take a picture of it rolled off my finger on my Bible on the floor and I can't find it I still hadn't been I was in there for 15 minutes looking for this little seed of faith you say bro Jill why don't you say that because don't lose your little seed because sometimes it's harder to regain to find than it is to have it initially oh I had it right here in the little bag but you know I got a little bit bold and pulled it out stuck it on my finger gonna do some cute send it to my wife so real just hello you a little seed I promise you is back to on the ground somewhere but maybe be planted and rise up to a great great tree of faith but if the Bible says now if notice if you have faith if so this word implies a little bit of uncertainty many people have religion but they don't have faith many people have a Creed but they don't have faith many people have an imagination they believe that you're healed or delivered or whatever maybe but they don't have faith many people have hope but they don't have faith see faith begins when you put your belief in action let me say that again faith begins when you put your belief into action when God puts you somewhere should've complained about it in this that another know you begin to react or to act upon it and that proves that you have faith in where God has you tell me have you here just little bitty Church for a purpose for a season but don't complain because there's not more coming in sees more going out versus coming in but God has you here for a purpose put your faith in action go out and tell everybody about it there's a message Church there's somebody preaches the gospel truth and bring them in and bring them in put your faith into action that you know that you're here for a purpose that God's planted you here and it's time that you grow where you've been playing it but see the question isn't today how many things we believe but is how genuine is the faith that we have in the things that we do believe is your faith unshakable is your faith unmovable that's the question that you need to answer within yourself today is my faith unshakable it's my faith unmovable ro-bear makes a statement now in the second miracle he says some people have great big faith like this anything can happen you know what I'm jealous of those people I don't have that kind of face my wife's used to say you got booted off faith I may have Bulldog favor boo doll faces just must receive faint refusing to let go of it I just stay with it but you got some of those that have they have just gigantic faith or great big faith and all some miracles take place but it doesn't mean that I'm any less of a Christian I'm any less of a believer I mean unless part of the body of God then they are see the next has faith bill them say this deep a little bit deeper next has faith this he takes quite a little while he says some had paint like a mustard seed but if it's a mustard seed fade genuine faith hold on to it just keep believing in a become marvel faith in it become grapefruit faith then it become a mountain Bey it'll bring you right out if you just stay with a hold on he'll bring you right straight to the line if you'll stay with it he says but don't get discouraged and don't believe the symptoms he said the symptoms are the devil's lies but I'm not seeing anything happen it doesn't matter what you see your experience today ain't based on what you see it's based on the Word of God and the Word of God is shame amen to the believer it is just say the Lord to the believer in will you get funded in the worst stay with it we look here in Hebrews 11 and verse 1 the Bible says that faith is the substance of things so forth so we got to have an understanding or what faith is so faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen that we're subdomain means actual existence so it is the actual existence it's the steadfastness of mind it's a firmness it's the courage it's a resolution it's confidence it's a firm trust it's the assurance so faith is the assurance it's the actual existence for brother till I don't feel like it when you don't have faith because your faith ain't based on your feeling your faith is based on what the word says it ain't based on how you feel about a name based on what you're seeing it makes you want you heal it you're hearing you're smelling and all that all those things can lie to you but it's based on the Word of God and the Bible says that the evidence of things not seen that word evidence there is proof it's the proof of things not seen that's why Abraham could call those things that are not as though they were because he had faith in a God who he's never seen Oh church we've seen signs and wonders there's no reason for us not to believe in this our Abraham didn't have those signs and those wonders but abraham believed nevertheless what about us this morning will you believe the Word of God for your hour so we got a look at faith here and I want to bring this story down brother Browns little with this young girl this is 1947 faith is a substance this young girl he's getting to show her now that she didn't have faith maybe you many of you probably know about this but he says oh brother Branham she has over the Bremen do you think I'll live he goes I believe you will but do you believe you will she said oh yes I believe sure I don't care what my church says I believe Georgia Carter got well said I'll get well - I'm just scared of the operation no brother Brown makes the statement send down a girl thought she believed and many times we come to church and we think we believe she thought she believed just like me you come down tonight you think you believe but she didn't believe and he said sister I don't mean to hurt your feelings but you do not believe I notice here's a prophet of God do you think maybe you're getting praise on the property he's gonna build you up lift you up Oh bless God you gotta fake no sister you don't believe could you imagine me coming to this church this morning telling every one of y'all y'all don't believe man and brothers I said never had me back more he preached doom and gloom and I was gonna make it but here's a prophet right here standing before this young girl her life was on the line she was about to die and she's thinking that she's believing so he had to go and catch her and tell her you do not believe though you think you believe and so that's why I'm here this morning maybe some of you come in here and you think oh well go to a message Church Oh bless God I believe God sent a prophet I believe brother Branham and you can quote scriptures and quotes and all that but yet something but believing and having faith are two different animals morning I want you to have faith to speak what you have Nina because if we're not going to put it back on the days go by we're gonna put it back that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday back then today this morning it'll be the same for you tomorrow but you gotta anchor your soul in faith that you know that God's Word is real she said oh I believe I believe brother Branham was she thought she believed she had hope but faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen you see what I mean and I said sister in an ordinary case because I think I could have a little time I'll let you have time maybe to take take about a little bit as much faith to go out with it but you haven't got you haven't got an immediate attention or because you've got to have an immediate of attention right now for I'm gonna ask I'm gonna be honest with you you'll not live to see the hospital and so she said well she believed but she did not I said sister you do not have faith whole reverend Branham I have faith to believe anything notice her reply he goes if you have faith notice his reply if you have faith I want to ask you or show you rather that you don't have faith now listen and catch every word I've been hanging in a room from a chandelier was a string and on the end of the string was a little bracelet it had and it was a little white bracelet with little red sets in it where a child probably been playing with it you know swinging it from room to room because I've seen that little bracelet hanging there and I say young lady how far are you away from that bracelet she said approximately 15 feet he goes now all you adults here are you people just turn your back right right around to me sitting now there's nothing's gonna be done to hurt anyone I just got to speak to the girl because she's got to kiss the idea now and you got to kiss the idea now don't put it off for the next service you have to catch the idea now and I said to the young lady now you tell me you got faith to believe all things I mean you got this kind of faith this morning to believe all things that's it precisely what I thought every church I preached you said all day and I've been a hand raised yet okay Muno bracelet she said I have sir he goes how long has it been since you eaten she said about three days can't even keep water on my stomach and I said now if you believe with all your heart and you proved to me now that you got faith he says you look directly right directly at that bracelet it's hanging there in midair and you make that bridge to swing around and around the room and then you make a swing back and forth in the room and then make it stop and I'll believe you have faith how many's ready to take that challenge she said old brother Brandon what why ask me something like that I said well I want to see if you had faith jesus said all things are possible if you believe she said well brother Bell no one could do that he says anyone can there believe she said well I don't believe that anyone can do that he goes when I thought you said you believe for all things then she says well I don't believe there's anyone can do that that's the material brother branham she said could you do that he said yes ma'am well can I see it done he said if you desire she said I desire he says now then of course listen here fasting my eyes to see that bracelet which you can yourself notice which you can yourself he goes if you don't if you won't doubt in your heart and it started moving around and around then it move back and forth around and crossways and it stopped and she said bro been less spiritualism he goes I thought maybe did you say something like yet she said there's no such thing can be showed in the Bible anything like that he goes I thought you'd say something like that she said show me where it's in the Bible why never I don't believe it she said you don't believe she said no show me where it said in the Bible he said now one day Jesus passed by a tree he wanted to find some fruit on it there was no fruit on it but he put a curse on it in the tree begin to wilt and when they pass by at noon the tree was wilting down and Peter remark and he said how quick the tree would wilted and he said if you will say in your heart for this tree to be plucked up and cast into the sea and would not doubt it would now we have faked to believe that but we refuse to have fate to make a bracelet move he says now if you say in your heart for this tree to be pulled up and cast into the sea when I'm down you heart you'll have it he's also said now if you'd said into this mountain be thou removed and not doubt in your heart but by and by it will come to pass did he say that sure he did he says now if you have faith the size of a mustard seed if the faith of a mustard seed will move move that mountain how much smaller faith would it take to move that bracelet let me tell you a church if the faith the size of a mustard seed can move monks how much smaller faith will it take for you this morning to receive your healing what about your total deliverance what about your loss what about your children how much smaller faith would it take this morning if that little bitty seen that little bit of faith - movement what would it take the move on your situation all they take for God to come back this little room this morning ever getting to raise you up it give you desires of your heart hey let's take a great amount of faith it just takes us steadfast don't believe the word just that little seed can move a mountain I'm not asking you to move a bracelet I'm not asking you to move a mountain this morning I'm just asking you to have faith to believe for your situation just have faith to believe for your situation to believe for your circumstance she said well lookie here I want to ask you something she said did God move that bracelet did the devil move he said neither one of them moved it then hide in the world did it move well I said I moved it said we're here 15 feet away from it said no my faith moved it see if you ask anything and not doubt if you ask anything and not doubt the Bible says here if we go back to John and verse 14 he that believeth on me how many of you believe this morning and the works that I do you believe the works that he did you shall do also do you really believe that this morning the works that I do shall you do also and greater works than these shall you do because I go into the Father not greater as far as your gonna do more miraculous but no greater because now it's no longer a single man ministry now some most emember body called the bride of Jesus Christ all over the world doing what the same time the same wonders the same works that's how now that the bride is doing the great work Satan already knows it's about you that you can do the greater works you just don't have faith yet to believe he says whatsoever you ask in my name that I will do that the father will be glorified in the son if you ask anything in my name I will do it I've not asked one thing from God yet but what he's not brought into pass what brother Joe didn't happen overnight no it didn't happen overnight having over meeting Heights sometimes it just takes a long long time sometime it take weeks months you know we know the story it was 33 weeks if I'm not mistaken for Daniel there or David whichever one of them he was asked you know his prayer went up and here comes in the Spirit of God and he was fighting his whole way back to get to him it was three weeks but he hurt him the very first time he prayed and gods heard your prayer the very first time you pray for that situation for that loved one that you have a need that you got God's heard your prayer and if we know that he hears our prayer then we know that we get our petitions asked because why because God is faithful to his people but see we declare the we're bride of his bone of his bone flesh of his race we decree that we are him in this hour then where's our faith to believe the impossible where is our faith to believe in the supernatural we say God's supernatural God's just natural the thing is that we got to rise ourselves up in God's presence so that we can start responding like God yet he's supernatural but the things he does is natural to God and if we're Messiah if we're gods then the things that we do are just not supernatural they're just natural because why we're believer it's naturally for us to believe the Word of God it shouldn't be a supernatural thing cause to believe does say it the Lord but many times I think we've we find that God puts these things in the word and we just glossed right over if I had this kind of faith I can speak to that now but yeah we don't believe that mountains gonna move we just quoted holy blessed God we can pluck that tree up and go planting over here put it in the sea you know but I believe right now within each and every believer here this morning is the power of God to make those things come to pass and you're gonna find it as we keep going through this service today into this evening we find now we can do the greater works but it's time we put our faith into action people will say well that only pertain to brother battle well if it only pertain to brother Branham then he's he would have said these signs should follow him and not them come on somebody these signs to follow him and not them well as you guys got to be for a prophetic ministry well I'm glad it is for a prophet in misery because I'll read revelations 10 and verse 8 somebody's taking the book somebody must prophesy again who's that promise on he's already ran his course brother branham's no over here the promise ah now it's the bride we've eaten a book or a proper sign again you've got a prophetic ministry and it's time that you take the circle and you put your faith tonight and you make the Word of God live in this hour somebody's going to be a written epistle somebody's going to be a direct reflection of a word made manifest in this hour and when they got a need they don't go crying about it they just cry out to God ain't got no sponsor that ain't got issues of that thing ain't got ministers to him and you see the hand of God move on their behalf the Bible is Jesus speaking many mighty works he could not do because of the people's unbelief oh don't let that be your crutch so let that be your hindrance your unbelief no be like that that man said lord I believe but help down my unbelief I believe I want to believe help my unbelief help me when I get down help me when I when I when I look at the symptoms I look at the situation and I take my eyes off the prom Oh help me dear no stop to have faith that I believe back to the story of the little girl she said now what do you Tim she says well do you mean to tell me what part does that play with God that part there and he says now there was an angel came down in the room and told me that way or that back way back before I was born before I was ordained with the gift of divine healing and he came and he told me in a room one night they God has sent a gift and the gift of divine healing was for the people and if I could get two people to believe me and would be sincere when I prayed nothing would stand before the prayer and I said therefore speaking face-to-face with the supernatural being I believed it with all my heart and if I can get you to believe me with all your heart that's what smooth God if you can believe this morning Church with all your heart that is what's going to move God your belief moves God to your situation your faith to take God at His Word moves God to your scene moves God to that trial that you're in it brings God on the scene for you it's your faith that moves God and then he says then your he'll say your faith has saved you you see what I mean your faith to believe have saved you not what you worked up to not your adults in your mind but what you really know the very evidence of things not seen you see what I mean and the girl said I truly know there's something above that I've never reached she said I'll try with all my heart and God had mercy on me said let me believe that she was sincere and what I want to believe let me believe he was I took her by the hand then and we've been the vibration was pouring forth from that ruptured appendix and I had prayer for and it stopped it immediately and I said god bless you sister your faith now has saved you let me tell you it's the same thing today Church today they look the same prophet of God the guys probably may not be here but the same spirit of Christ is here and if I can get you to believe this morning and we can be sincere when we pray you say that was just for better that's for the bride of Jesus Christ if you can be sincere when you pray before that prayer not even cancer was staying before that prayer keeps a cancer rose I'll say yes cancer we had a sister in our church just a few months ago she was diagnosed with Stage four lymphoma lymphoma cancer all in a row her left or right long right here it was all black completely blacked over as she got weaker and weaker and weaker by the day and by the day as she finally there was must she has had a lay on the couch she'd have straight to do nothing but she would lust her up straight to come to church service after service after service they did four treatments of chemo this is a 12-week process or a twelve treatment process she done four treatments and went back to the doctor and she went back into the pasture she was completely totally clean best features on Facebook best pictures on it she was perfectly here walk but go straight to believe but doctors say God don't here I'll turn it up he's alive God still knows today God still delivers today and his base don't fake this morning her faith saved her good a young girl in our church but a twelve year old girl Mariah Pruitt she had alopecia I mean you know what alopecia is it's a disease where we as you lose all your hair and the doctors say it's incurable once you lose all your hair it's never coming back well she came to our youth camp a couple couple years ago she could quit those our church she came to the youth camp we have a prayer line on Saturday night and she came with some bobby pins I mean you know what bobby pins are you ladies should know we're by being his right brother and we'll call him Jimmy pins or whatever bobby pins she come up with that prayer Allah and she came in as she says when I come out on the other side I want to put these back in my hair oh the faith of a young girl one morning she woke up and she heard her mom was playing a tape at the end of the service brother band was singing I can how will I do believe and some struck a chord in her heart she began to witness and testify our tear I shall hide do believe and she beside a day after day and she came into that prayer line I can I will I do believe he says I'm gonna wear these when I come out on the other side and meet a it was just a few weeks later something beginning to happen here we're gonna agree grow on her head and today she's got a little bra black beautiful hair more bringing what it was when she was when she was born with my but cuz God answered that faith the doctor said he was incurable but God still Jehovah I the LORD thy God knows all the diseases and he'll know about sicknesses and whatsoever you ask in my name dad I'll do alopecia has to leave in his name cancer has to leave in his name but brother I don't have a need like that maybe you got a love let me just tell you testimony about a loved one I got a cousin grew up in this message he grew up and he just went out and went out in the world got into drugs got an alcohol got married had kids and yet his kids and his wife would come to service every service they come up for prayer for Papa or further daddy they come up for prayer we went our dad you know we went our dad every service that a wife would come up with a little prayer cloth we'd pray over the Deacons and the brother the ministers we pray over and she'd go tuck him on the mattress or tuck him underneath the pillow but he had a slew of prayer cloth under that bed hey wonder why he kept fighting oh but one day he got a he asked his old daughter she got a daughter but all his family can sing very gifted one in particular is the youngest she's got a beautiful voice he says I want you to sing this song she looked at him she goes I'll sing it and you play for me in church says I'll sing it when you play for me in church oh all it took was that response something beginning to stir he takes me I need you to pray for me he takes two I need you to be praying for him he takes a bunch of us brothers somebody's close friends he says I need y'all to be praying for me I didn't know what was going on but I knew God was dealing with because he's never responded to us like yeah oh he come to church on a Wednesday night brother Timothy Prue was preaching he was talking about the man the little warrior there or the military guy got off the train and he had spiritual amnesia and here this brother was sitting there and he had spiritual amnesia he didn't know who he was but he know he took them some ladies didn't know hard to get back I remember one time a conversation I had with him I said man why are you doing this he goes do you think I want to live this way I don't want to live this way I want to serve God but there's nothing inside of me they don't let me do it that's how bad he didn't God I saw the condition that even God that's what the devil kept trying to put over there's no use you have no desire or mateus a son of God can go a long time before you ever recognize that he's a son of God always just see that God deposited before the foundational world he was inside him it may have been a little bitty mustard seed oh it had life in it but he said through that service and brother Timothy started up talking about that guy he started wandering off the train there and he saw this water tower oh but he saw the water tower triggered dolf's he's startled remember at home well my cousin just so had lelee design from a water tower but they tell your church that devil was on the run here he was he doesn't begin to stir something and he went up to the altar after the service and he says no bro Brown never said that a water tower he said yes he did here it is right here he fell to his knees and gave his heart to God and he hain't turn back yet what do you say I'm saying the same God that saved you is the same God because your loved ones he's the same God but it's based on your faith that mama never quit that daughter in the songs never quit praying never quit believing a wife never gave up on her husband she'd always saved him a seat in the pew in case he decided to drop him let me tell you another story had a prayer line one night brother Wayne lost was at our church on a Wednesday night boy imitating a power God came in that building it seemed like we pray for every person in the church well young girl Kimberly one of our young sisters 16 17 at the time she came here and she was crying she had her eyes all cry you know just tore up she goes I really want my brother to be safe but this young man I got into college he didn't call her now and then started doing drugs and in the world and just doing all kind of things running around with the bone wrong crowd playing worldly music you know very gifted kid but he was completely lost well service went on and on you know and it's a lemak lot and mom and dad and daughter ain't home he begins to get worried he gets in his car then 30 he they ain't home yet they he runs to the neighbor's house that goes to our church they home either he's all Lord the rational took place 14 he ran to the church he comes stumbling into the church hey drug him to the office that boy ain't never been the same the faith of a young girl went after her brother some twenty minutes later he comes bagging in the house of God but he's a real born-again son of God today what was it was a faith of a sister they stand there for a brother just and in need and God responded to her faith whatsoever you ask in my name that I would have show me maybe summer maybe minutes but whatsoever you ask in my name that I will do so the safe faith let's say this young girl the same faith that went out to my cousin the same faith to save sister Elena bus from cancer and Mariah Pruett from alopecia is the same faith that you need right here this morning for whatever trial you're going through continue on the story a few moments later I was sitting in a chair because I went to sleep someone's coming up I had just to get a little bit of rest before returning home because I was afraid I'd break up somewhere on the road have a wreck and I was sitting there and then I called the ambulance and told them there was no need he goes I was waking by one of the family while the girl was out of bed she didn't eat a pint of ice cream and she never had a knife from that day to this completely delivered and notice every time the prophet of God if you listen to the ends of the tapes in the prayer lines or when he had a special prayer for different ones he said your faith have saved thee see it wasn't him doing the healing it was God recognising the faith of the people and when their faiths reached up enough to God's Word and God pronounced him healed or pronounced and delivered so it's not based on a man God don't want you to put your faith on a man you don't put your faith in a church put your faith in dust said or in the Word of God cuz man can fail you Church can crumble and fall but the Word of God sure and stedfast in a heavens and earth will pass away that this world will never pass away so I'll say tonight is time that we cast all our reasons aside we throw away all the doubts and unbelief and we were getting to say this is my day Lord I'm going to be delivered today I'm going to be healed today my kids are coming home today my Lost Levels are coming back today I refuse to leave out of this church the same as I won't did something's gonna happen my faith today it's gonna pull God to my knee program said that faith is the only direct positive sense it's the sixth sense faith is more than sight features more than feeling you don't feel faith you don't taste faith you don't smell faith you don't see faith faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not real and when real faith listen when real faith takes a hold in the heart it's not intellectual you found people trying to make their self believe we've all been there it's okay it's called human nature that's why the Bible says cast down imagination could imagine yourself healing and believe don't imagine it any longer no probably I said picture yourself the whole body and walk into it don't imagine it picture it yeah there it is I'm walking into it he says it's not an election is no more reason it's real the Spirit of God witnessing through you God's Word is truth he goes I'll stay right with it yes sir and that's what brings the results but now we know that faith is a substance Hebrews 11:1 things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen but the brother Brown makes a statement in a perfect faith and I would encourage you if you had listened to that sermon in quite a long time maybe you want to go back and listen to it perfect faith he says now here's where many people fail to receive their healing or what they're asking for because they take faith to something that it's not they don't believe it's not an imagination it's an actual substance see it's not what you imagine is just as real as any sense of your body wouldn't clear anything is just as real as my eyes see this piece of paper right here it's just as real as that as a light right there he goes it's just as real as I feel my coat it's just as real as you hear the baby talking right here see it's just as real the only thing is is you can't show it to somebody else you have it alone see it's yours faith is the substance of things hoped for it's not a myth he says notice it's something that you possess not an imagination if you really have it so it's not in a man it's not an organization it's not in a group of people it's in God because God is a word and your faith is in God and one faith but that makes a statement here he says now there's many times that people have faith today and tomorrow they haven't got it I'm not even gonna ask you to raise your hands because the look on your face says guilty right we all been there guilty Bojo don't pick me out don't embarrass me in front of I don't even know you we're good he says now there many times people have fake say it's more they haven't got it the next day there's something in something else he said but when God anchors it and you see it there's nothing ever gonna make you move from it and he says now the church has itself up in the power of God because we're too close to the end now and I believe that your church is in a condition where we can teach it a little deeper things and rub some of them make-believe off get into something real I think it's time you know we you know we're worried about the seven seals and let me tell you the great that the seven seals are open but if you ain't got faith for your own personal needs why do you want to have faith for the seven seals there's a lot of times we need God to meet our needs not our intellectual understanding God I need you to be my healer I need you to be my deliverer but oh you guys so many people that focus on the deep things of God and yeah the Spirit of God loves the deep things of God and there's a time and a place for those deep things but when you're going through the valley and you're in that trial you need a God as the little boy said I need God with skin on them I need a living God to come by my way I don't need these deep intellectual thoughts I need a living God to manifest a living presence if form I need I need that kind of faith lord help my unbelief this morning let me believe in the supernatural let me believe in a Living God let me believe in a miracle let me believe in a divine healer let me believe in a God that still say O God that still delivers oh god that still sets free Oh God is still able to move let me believe this morning in thank God John 16 in that day you should ask me nothing but verily verily I say unto you whatsoever you ask the Father in my name he will give it to you propose oh you sure are doing a lot of reiterating well maybe a little bit of repetition you're the anchor in here but it'll go from here down to here and when he gets into here brother BAM said that's where life begins but it passes through the mind in a drop down into the heart then life can begin to spring up no longer is it intellectual now it's oh I believe whatsoever you ask the Father in my name I recite that all time whatsoever things I desire when I pray if I can believe that I have then I'll have what I asked for that's one of my favorite I quote that scripture almost every day Lord I don't come to you in this we're just you know have hardness but Lord you said whatsoever things I can that I desire if I can believe this morning when I pray God I believe that yours that same kind of God this morning I've seen the miracles I've seen deliverance I've seen salvation as I've seen God move a super-nice way God I know if I can just get you right here if I can be sincere when I pray that you minister to this need and I've never seen God failed me yet he says now he will give it to you hitherto have you asked nothing in my name ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full well I think Pentecost fell he says you can never exhaust God's love and mercy to you come on somebody ah ah you know I asked too much he finds some people you go to some churches man there isn't one person they come with you they come to the altar every service you got those kind of people well like I told the church last weekend where I was and I said maybe if you had their needs you'd be at the altar here a lot more to do you don't know what that person is dealing with you don't know what that person is going through maybe that person is do being as sincere as they can you know many times we look back like man will they ever get up from the altar but if we were in that condition and that need maybe would be there a little bit more sincere a little bit more seeking Gallivan more but but brother L says you can never exhaust God's love and mercy to you you say well I hate to bother you so much father now how many you got children well Jesse you don't have to say we got you got way too many well you know this is the truth you know you can't bother God I got four kids and I we haven't we have a two-story house and my office is up on the up story to the far end of the house and I soundproofed it I did it on purpose because I knew I had four kids or at least three kids at the time third one was on the way the fourth one is coming later so when we built the house I built it because I was going to my study I wanted to be quiet I want to be shut in so I go up there and I start studying you know just never fails next thing you know you hear these little feet there ain't no knocking on the door no they just walk right on in Papa what are you doing what was it look like I don't ever come up here until I'm ready to study and they don't ever come up here until I'm ready to study so there's no bothering papa he's just stubborn his office that's the same way it is what God you came bothering God Oberlin's over the door shut but it ain't love all go through it anyway my mom say you can come to them to the Father boldly it's time that we come don't worry about I love my ass too much you can't ask too much from God you can't exhaust any cultural found Allah he wants to be AB he wants to be needed he wants to supply your need my little girl she seeks but I promise she she don't stand that tall she's a little bitty and she come up err Mama's no went to the store where she knows there's popsicles and ice in the refrigerator I'm study I'm like y'all him a long time ago parents trayful know what but here she come no knocking walk right on in what you doing I'm studying can I get a popsicle you know what that means don't you can you come get me a popsicle and you know what I do right I'll go down take a break walk down get her a popsicle cut the top off of it give it back to her put a little napkin around and go back upstairs I'll make time for them the same way God makes time for you he's too sad well God's busy no he's never too busy for his children and brother Jesse you can testify we're never too busy for our children when they got a need we're there to minister to that need because let me tell you you are God to your children they hold you in great esteem and the puppet was getting all mad name brand they don't know they're gonna see the agency Jesus Christ being reflected but I say it to say you can never exhaust the inexhaustible found the life perhaps that he was to be bothered that way he does don't ever think that you can ask too much of God I believe the scripture says you have not because you ask not and you ask not because you believe not he wants you to ask and believe that your joy may be full he wants you to ask abundantly he wants you to ask for big things don't limit your faith to little mustard seed get on out there is some big kind of fate and move out into things big things is just as easy to receive as little things because you must have you must have to believe all things he goes you gotta have faith you just can't just go out there and just have hardly do a bit you can because now you can put it to rental to the right to the work and it'll be just fine so I say tonight don't live in your faith to just small things don't limit your faith tonight to your situation don't live in God's ability to move on your behalf because you're in a trial know you expect God to come down you expect God to move you expect God to raise you up you expect God to deliver you expect God to do what His Word says in there you can never exhaust God's goodness could you imagine a little bitty fish and a great big ocean swimming around all of a sudden poof I got to consider this thing if I drink all this water I'm going down now this little bitty fish is massive ocean he swim my oh ho ho ho stop it sometime let's how do we do we stop the hop God if I do this it's gonna be my hand oh brother barely makes the statement he says now he goes it could easily be done for that fish to drink all that water that ocean then it could be that you can exhaust God's goodness he says now now it could more easily be done you could ask too much of God he's the end he goes you cannot ask too much ago he's the inexhaustible Fenna life whatever you have need of ask him and believe it he provided in the redemptive blessing when he died at Calvary and he gave the promise to you for everything that you have neither while you're in this journey it's yours if you'll ask and believe it and where's the believer planted by the inexhaustible fountain of life oh you got a do church's drink and push out drink and push out come to serving and drinking in the same me Lord that's the world oh hey begin to push out delivery hey push out healing ain't even gonna push out move what are you doing you're drinking in faith you're drinking in the word cuz thank Tomic by hearing and hearing by the Word of God you can exhaust God's goodness you can't exhaust God's grace everything that you have meet up when you receive the Holy Ghost is in you already from here to the other side all you got to do is know how to use the faith that God's given you and the Bible says that he's given every man a measure of faith some of yours is only that big some of yours is not even that big but it doesn't matter because every man has been given a measure of faith all that you have to do church is put it in action as I begin to bring this down to a close my map says now sons and daughters of God would create a world would create them a world out there and go live on a private life owner because you had the power in you to do that if you got the shadow of the power God in you you got the power do it God as I'm nipping at you see what I mean the power that's in you will make you could speak a world into existence and go and live on it but you tremble when I talked about moving that bracelet you were stricken in fear oh I can't do that but ya know probably God says you got if you got the shadow of the power of God and you you can create another world and go live a private life on it he goes that's what's the powers in the church now but it's controlled by law and the law is not keeping a bunch of Commandments it's the law of faith Jesus says all things are possible to them that believe if you can believe it whatever God will lead your soul to believe that is yours if you can find the key to this law of faith that opens it to you you see what I mean if you're a son and daughter of God that never leaves you is with you all the time but your faith gets because your faith gets away from it but it's still there so we're trying to bring your faith back in line with it he says now God's power listen as we begin to bring us to a close God's power is limited to your faith that's the only limited has is your faith all things are possible to them that believe there's a great God in heaven and if we can only get in contact like a direct line to him all things are possible but we must come in contact with them with no static nowhere you remember you you should turn that door down on the radio you hear like till you pick up a right channel you know what we need to do is get other out of the way and tune in to the Father so we have a direct line there's no static no where and he says just a clear channel between us and God and then he said if you say it to this mountain be moved and not doubt on your heart but believe what you have said he goes now you can't Bluff it Satan doesn't Bluff too easy he goes so you can't Bluff it but when you really know that it's got to happen it just must happen and he says now as much as your faith will be released that's how much power you can have because in you dwells the power to make heavens and earth God dwells in you and your sons and daughters of God there you are but it's your faith according to your faith be it unto you if thou canst believe all things are possible and we
