[0:00] play a little bit of a a background
[0:01] music just to [music] to uh uh set a
[0:05] atmosphere and create an environment
[0:06] where the Lord Jesus feels welcome.
[0:08] [music] You know, we come here to uh to
[0:10] grow a closer walk with the Lord Jesus
[0:12] and entertain our creator. You know,
[0:15] we're longing to feel [music] his
[0:16] presence and to see him and experience
[0:19] more of him. And and you know, I I was
[0:21] sitting back there and as I got to I
[0:23] began to pray and just thank on the
[0:24] Lord. You know, the Lord just began to
[0:26] minister to my heart and and I got to
[0:28] thinking about coming out here. You
[0:30] know, think about the courtroom when
[0:31] brother Bham said the docket set. Here I
[0:34] come to be an eyewitness of the
[0:36] resurrection power of Jesus Christ. You
[0:39] know, you might you can see things or
[0:40] hear things, but they won't stand in
[0:41] court.
[0:42] &gt;&gt; But I'm I've experienced it for myself
[0:45] and I you know, and I you know, but but
[0:47] about two weeks ago, God started to
[0:49] minister. I woke up in the middle of the
[0:50] night and God just ministered to my
[0:51] heart and I wrote this note down about
[0:52] 3:00 in the morning that uh uh walking
[0:55] in the vision, you know, and the next
[0:56] day I woke up and God started just kind
[0:58] of ministering to in my heart that we're
[1:00] walking in the vision, walking in the
[1:02] vision that we was in his mind before
[1:04] the foundation of the world. And you
[1:06] know, we we find oursel uh you know, uh
[1:09] you know, and then that's when I I just
[1:10] began to become more of a reality to me
[1:12] that you know, friend, I ain't nothing
[1:14] but just a just a Christian, a soldout
[1:17] son of God filled with the baptism of
[1:19] the Holy Ghost. And that that's what I
[1:21] want to testify that what I what I have,
[1:23] you can have. And and I hope that it
[1:26] just makes you thirsty for more. Anybody
[1:28] here out there online that thirsty for
[1:30] more that no matter what you have need
[1:31] of, it's in Christ Jesus.
[1:33] &gt;&gt; You know, I say we're like Joshua and
[1:34] Caleb. We're out here spying. We've
[1:36] spied out the land and we come back to
[1:38] tell you that it's filled with all the
[1:39] benefits. I don't care what you have
[1:41] need of. The baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:43] salvation, healing, deliverance,
[1:46] prodals, come home,
[1:48] &gt;&gt; you name it, it's here. Restoration,
[1:50] we're going to get into all that. But
[1:52] you know, you know, I come to just uh
[1:54] just to share my story and share my
[1:56] experience. Strength of hope of Jesus
[1:58] Christ. You know, the message of the
[1:59] hour is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:01] to you personally, you know, and I want
[2:04] to tell you about my Jesus.
[2:05] &gt;&gt; And, you know, I don't want to tell you
[2:06] about some historical god or some
[2:08] painted fire. I want to tell you about a
[2:10] fire that shut up in my bones, you know,
[2:12] and I want to tell you how my fire got
[2:14] lit. Glory to God. And so, it [snorts]
[2:16] just gets me fired up to think about,
[2:18] you know, what we're displaying is the
[2:21] resurrection power of Jesus Christ.
[2:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. making him Hebrews 13:8, Jesus
[2:26] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[2:28] forever.
[2:29] &gt;&gt; The simplicity of God's been dealing
[2:31] with me on that simplicity of a life
[2:33] lived.
[2:34] &gt;&gt; Simply living a Christian life,
[2:37] &gt;&gt; you know, that that's what's been so
[2:38] heavy on my heart, you know, and you
[2:40] know, we're going to get on down in my
[2:41] notes right now, but that's fine. You
[2:42] know, it's like I could ask you, what is
[2:44] church to you? Is this just to come to
[2:46] and go through the motions? Come through
[2:48] as uh you know, just to do your
[2:50] religious duties? uh you know what is
[2:53] the message to you
[2:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:54] &gt;&gt; Is it just intellectual? Is it just
[2:57] something you know made up? Or is it is
[3:00] the Bible or in this message is it going
[3:02] to come off of the paper into the heart
[3:04] into a reality into our lives? And and
[3:07] you know that's where God's been
[3:08] ministering to my heart, you know, and
[3:09] that's just you know, you know, I just
[3:11] have a heart for the people to to
[3:13] encourage the people and inspire them as
[3:15] God's inspired my life. You know, me and
[3:17] my brother-in-law, we got we got a
[3:18] little prison outreach. we go to prisons
[3:20] and we go hit the streets and go the
[3:22] highways and the byways and compel them
[3:23] and just tell them about Jesus
[3:25] &gt;&gt; and you know and that that's where I f
[3:27] I've been finding my finding my my post
[3:29] and that's where I said you know I
[3:30] didn't I didn't get to that yet but but
[3:31] but when I I wrote down walking in the
[3:34] vision and back to the future I wrote
[3:36] that little note down back to the future
[3:37] because where I'm going to take you
[3:39] right now is I want to take you in the
[3:40] back part of the mind of God where he
[3:42] saw us before the foundation of the
[3:44] world you can see that great creator the
[3:46] master builder you know I'm a builder
[3:48] and a creator you know I'm a chip up off
[3:49] the old block. I like to create things
[3:51] and make tables and and build stuff. And
[3:53] like I was telling Brad, you can imagine
[3:55] the great creator out there, you know,
[3:58] sculpting each one of us, sculpting us
[4:01] into the the way he sees us, each one of
[4:03] us individually and fearfully and
[4:05] wonderfully made. And he's like, you
[4:07] know, and when I'm working on a table
[4:08] and I'm I'm I'm sanding and I'm honing
[4:10] it down, I'm like, nah, a little bit
[4:12] more. And I get I finally get it to
[4:13] where I want it. And that's where God
[4:16] was ministering to me that I'm walking
[4:18] in that position, walking in my post of
[4:20] duty, walking in the vision.
[4:22] &gt;&gt; Well, I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[4:23] What is all that's why I'm just saying
[4:25] the simplicity of my life. I just want
[4:26] to show you the revelation of Christ to
[4:29] me. I want it to be a quickening power
[4:30] to you. That is so simple that God came
[4:33] down from glory, died on the cross, paid
[4:36] his blood to pay a debt that I couldn't
[4:38] pay and healed me, filled me, sealed me,
[4:40] filled me, and delivered me.
[4:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and did all these things so
[4:44] he could come tabernacle my heart
[4:46] &gt;&gt; and be a Mark 16 church in action
[4:49] &gt;&gt; and he said signs and wonders follow the
[4:51] believer
[4:53] &gt;&gt; you know I might not be a prophet
[4:55] apostle I mean I am an apostle but I
[4:57] might not be a prophet a preacher a
[4:58] teacher evangelist you know but I am a
[5:02] believer
[5:03] &gt;&gt; and signs and wonders follow the
[5:04] believers so we should cast out devils
[5:06] in that name we should lay hands on the
[5:08] sick and they should recover and so that
[5:10] you know just being a real prayer
[5:11] warrior staying fed up, prayed up, read
[5:13] up, ready to go, fired up in Christ
[5:15] Jesus, having your personal relationship
[5:18] in tune with Christ. And that's where I
[5:20] just say that quickening power to me has
[5:22] been so real to see that revelation of
[5:24] Christ in me, the hope of glory, walking
[5:27] and living another written epistle read
[5:29] of all men, making us the word made
[5:32] flesh again.
[5:33] &gt;&gt; Man, that's just so rich. And that's why
[5:35] that's why I want that's why it just
[5:37] puts a fire in my bones. It gets me
[5:38] shoo.
[5:41] &gt;&gt; We done got all my my notes is all way
[5:43] jumbled up now. We we ain't even going
[5:45] to be able to [snorts]
[5:46] &gt;&gt; even go by the notes anymore. But praise
[5:48] God. You know that's why we just came
[5:50] here to talk about Jesus.
[5:52] &gt;&gt; Glorify his great name. Lift him up.
[5:54] &gt;&gt; You know, and just entertain him. You
[5:56] know what did you say the other day? He
[5:58] was talking about, you know, when when
[6:00] the brother was going down the road, he
[6:01] he he scooted a paper out of the way and
[6:03] Lord Jesus, here's you a seat. We want
[6:05] you to ride with us. You know, that's
[6:07] where we want to make him feel welcome.
[6:08] That's where we want him to come ride
[6:10] with us and walk with us and talk with
[6:11] us. He said, "I'll be with you even in
[6:13] you to the end of the world." You know,
[6:15] and you know, it's so encouraging as we
[6:16] go down through this journey.
[6:19] &gt;&gt; In Mark 5, he says here, "How be it,
[6:21] Jesus suffered unto him, but he said
[6:23] unto him, go home to thy friends and
[6:25] tell them how great things the Lord hath
[6:27] done and had had compassion on thee."
[6:30] And you know, this is legion. And you're
[6:33] looking, I was legion. eat up with
[6:34] demons, eat up with devils,
[6:37] &gt;&gt; one of the worst of the worst, but God
[6:38] is good. And he says here in verse uh uh
[6:41] uh 36, be not afraid, but only believe.
[6:46] &gt;&gt; First Corinthians 2:4, he said, "My
[6:48] speech and my preaching was not enticing
[6:50] words of man's wisdom, but in power and
[6:52] demonstration of the spirit."
[6:54] &gt;&gt; And so that's what I want my life to be.
[6:56] It's as simple what he's done for me,
[6:58] he'll do for you. I want I hope it
[7:00] encourages you tonight to go away from
[7:02] here stronger and desiring more of Jesus
[7:05] Christ, desiring a closer walk with him.
[7:09] &gt;&gt; And uh you know, [clears throat]
[7:14] like I said, boy, we got way off on my
[7:17] notes, but you know, we've spied out the
[7:19] land, you know, and you know, I didn't
[7:21] know where to start and and God gave me
[7:23] that little starting place there, you
[7:25] know, on the docket is set, you know, I
[7:26] thought that that was good. I like that,
[7:28] you know, and [snorts] and you know, and
[7:29] I I put in here in my notes and you
[7:31] know, the back to the future and and
[7:34] back to the future because if we're
[7:35] going to go back in the back part of
[7:36] God's mind, we're going to come back up
[7:37] here in the future to where we're at in
[7:39] present day time. But we can go back and
[7:41] go back. But we can go all the way back
[7:43] to the future that we have over in
[7:45] eternal life with Christ Jesus. That's
[7:48] But we're going to come on back here for
[7:49] a minute, but we're only going back to
[7:50] the future in eternity, huh? Woo! We're
[7:54] looking ready to get out here in the
[7:55] rapture and go back home. You know,
[7:57] we're only pilgrims and strangers here
[7:59] so long to go home. You know, we're
[8:01] contending for the faith that is once
[8:03] delivered to the saints. You know, I
[8:05] like the definition of vision. After I
[8:07] was looking, I was I was thinking about
[8:08] that walking in the vision. So, I looked
[8:09] up the definition of it. It says uh
[8:12] definition of it says the faculty or
[8:14] state of being able to see. She had a
[8:16] defective vision similar to eyesight and
[8:19] sight. says the ability to think about
[8:21] or plan the future with imagination or
[8:24] wisdom. You imagine you can imagine with
[8:26] your imagination right now God's great
[8:28] wisdom and his imagination with his
[8:31] fornowledge foreseeing everything. My
[8:34] goodness, how rich is that? So you can
[8:36] see that and then you you can see him
[8:38] seeing down through the sands of time
[8:39] allowing the devil to do what he did. He
[8:42] allowed the fall so he could come
[8:43] display himself. So he could display
[8:45] himself as your healer, display himself
[8:47] as your savior, display himself as your
[8:50] redeemer, your restorer. He said, "I'll
[8:52] make all things new." Glory to God. And
[8:55] he said the ability uh the the
[8:57] organization had lost its vision or
[8:59] direction. He said the imagination or
[9:01] creativity, a mental image of what the
[9:03] future will or could be like. Plural
[9:06] nouns, a vision of retirement. He said
[9:08] in an experience of seeing someone or
[9:10] something, a dream or a trance or as a
[9:12] supernatural
[9:14] aspiration, the idea came to him in a
[9:17] vision, a vivid mental image, especially
[9:20] one of the future. See the great creator
[9:23] out there seeing way down through the
[9:26] sands of time, seeing us right here.
[9:28] &gt;&gt; You imagine the Lord Jesus sitting right
[9:30] there saying, "I saw that way back
[9:33] there. I predestinated this appointment
[9:36] right now for us to be right here to
[9:38] fellowship and commune together. Huh? In
[9:41] one mind and one accord. Were they? Can
[9:44] we not get there today? You know, I got
[9:46] to thinking about I got to it's just
[9:47] getting a fire in my bone when you start
[9:49] saying you know who you are because you
[9:50] know who he is. You know who he is
[9:52] because of Malachi Malachi 4,
[9:54] Revelations 10:7, a messenger, a trumpet
[9:57] sounded called us out from among them
[9:59] pointing us back to our redeemer.
[10:03] He's our eleaser telling us the love
[10:05] secrets. That was so rich. You know,
[10:09] you know, when we started to realize
[10:11] when he said when she could realize who
[10:13] she is, that's where that's why I'm
[10:14] saying we ought to be able to realize
[10:16] who we are in Christ Jesus.
[10:18] &gt;&gt; If if they're going to get over there,
[10:19] it I was thinking about if they're going
[10:21] to get over there. And he said, uh uh
[10:22] they done miracles and cast out devils,
[10:24] did everything in that name. Depart from
[10:26] me, you workers of iniquity. I never
[10:28] even knew you. These workers of iniquity
[10:31] were doing works in his name and it was
[10:33] working for them. So how much more for a
[10:36] son and daughter of God should it work
[10:37] for us? The the bride of Jesus Christ.
[10:40] Glory to God.
[10:41] &gt;&gt; That's so rich, man. When you just think
[10:43] about it,
[10:46] &gt;&gt; we're gonna have to kind of take our
[10:47] time on some Oh no. We're going to take
[10:48] our time on some of that when I get to
[10:50] jumping around. That's what I was
[10:51] telling him. Then I get to rush and then
[10:52] I'm I miss good stuff, you know. And
[10:55] we're we're contending for the saints
[10:56] that was once delivered. We're
[10:58] contending for the saint. Well, we're
[10:59] contending for the saints and the faith
[11:00] that was once delivered to the saints.
[11:02] Yes, sir.
[11:05] &gt;&gt; You know, and I just hope it stirs your
[11:06] heart tonight, you know, where wherever
[11:09] you are in Christ Jesus. And, you know,
[11:11] we want to stir the heart so that you
[11:13] understand what the gospel is to you.
[11:15] You know, the gospel is more than just
[11:17] Jesus Christ coming in a manger. Jesus
[11:20] Christ on a cross. We got to get him off
[11:21] the cross and into our heart. What What
[11:24] is the message? you know, and as
[11:26] witnessing the message and doing
[11:27] outreach work, you know, it finally came
[11:29] a point when you're sharing the message
[11:30] and this and that and you see a a world
[11:33] full of 44,000 different denominations
[11:36] and then you see the great calling out
[11:38] of uh sons and daughters of God in
[11:42] Christ Jesus.
[11:43] &gt;&gt; We see the the good news is he called us
[11:47] out, called us back to the word. He he
[11:49] he uh uh set aside stored up food for us
[11:53] to feed on. We get to eat on this mana
[11:55] from heaven. Glory to God.
[11:57] &gt;&gt; You know, that's so rich. And so, just
[11:59] uncomplicating Jesus, making Jesus so
[12:02] simple that the simplest Christian could
[12:05] have what I got.
[12:07] &gt;&gt; It's all right there for you.
[12:09] &gt;&gt; And that that's where my heart is desire
[12:11] is to just make it so simple.
[12:13] &gt;&gt; And I think I think that's where the
[12:15] Lord, you know, I I going to get on down
[12:17] in there. I'll tell you, but like two
[12:18] years ago on the way to a prison, the
[12:20] Lord spoke to my heart and said, "My
[12:21] message is my story, and my story is my
[12:24] message." And it's took me all the way
[12:25] to now to really just get it. Because
[12:26] I've kind of questioned, you know, I
[12:28] thought, "Well, am I supposed to be a
[12:29] man? Am I supposed to be this, supposed
[12:31] to be that, supposed to be this?" But
[12:32] now God's quickened to me the reality of
[12:35] our lives speaking louder than words. My
[12:37] life preaching with the power and
[12:41] demonstration the words that we can sit
[12:43] here and preach to you. All
[12:45] [clears throat] the preaching that
[12:45] brother Jesse and brother Brad that they
[12:47] preach all them years that faith going
[12:49] forward inspired my faith in them times
[12:51] I needed deliverance. I needed healing.
[12:53] You know everything that this ministry
[12:54] has brought forth. I'm a product.
[12:58] &gt;&gt; I'm a witness. I'm a that's why I'm here
[13:01] to stand on the docket and say Jesus
[13:03] Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
[13:05] forever. And what he's done for me,
[13:06] he'll do for you. His resurrection power
[13:08] is fire in my bones.
[13:10] &gt;&gt; And they said, "Amen. We can go home
[13:12] now." Glory to God. Woo. Yes, sir.
[13:15] &gt;&gt; But yes, God is so good. It just gets me
[13:17] all, you know, fired up inside.
[13:20] &gt;&gt; Can y'all even hear that?
[13:23] &gt;&gt; I guess cuz I can't. [laughter]
[13:25] It's like I like feel like All right
[13:28] then. [snorts] All right.
[13:31] Yeah. And I said, uh, yeah. You know, no
[13:33] matter where you're at, I'm trying to
[13:36] work down just giving you a little my
[13:38] book. My my friends call me Storytime
[13:40] Tommy. If y'all want to know, they
[13:41] nickname me Storytime Tommy. might make
[13:43] a short story long. And so now y'all
[13:45] been getting a part of the pre-story
[13:46] before the story. [laughter]
[13:50] &gt;&gt; Yep. But yeah, my God is a a a chain
[13:53] breaking, way making, mountain moving,
[13:55] valley filling God. Whatever you have
[13:57] need of, he's a God of the mountain and
[13:58] God of the valley.
[14:00] &gt;&gt; He's here for you.
[14:02] &gt;&gt; We don't want to just go through the
[14:03] motions of being a Christian. You know,
[14:05] &gt;&gt; you know, uh, you know, like deer
[14:07] hunters and, uh, hunters like we are, we
[14:09] we we kill animals and we got trophy
[14:11] rooms and you can go around the room and
[14:13] see see this buck and see this and he
[14:15] could tell you a story. But I want to
[14:16] take you in the trophy room of Jesus
[14:18] Christ and show you these devil's heads,
[14:20] smoking, pornography,
[14:23] &gt;&gt; uh, jealousy,
[14:25] &gt;&gt; anger,
[14:26] &gt;&gt; huh? All these things we can go on all
[14:28] night long.
[14:30] &gt;&gt; Alcohol, drugs. God is a mighty God. We
[14:33] got all these trophies
[14:35] &gt;&gt; and it's so rich, you know,
[14:38] &gt;&gt; but you know, I grew up and I was always
[14:40] over the top, which you can probably
[14:41] tell a little bit by just seeing me this
[14:43] little bit you've already got here. Um,
[14:44] [snorts] I was always over the top and
[14:46] extreme everything I'd done. You know, I
[14:48] come from a broken home. My mom and dad
[14:50] divorced when I was like five, five, six
[14:52] years old. They done divorced twice at
[14:54] this point. The my dad was uh abusive to
[14:58] my mom and I got to see that a lot
[14:59] growing up and all these things. And you
[15:01] know, he was Baptist and mom was
[15:03] Catholic, too. And you know, as I grew
[15:05] up, you know, my mom my mom had
[15:06] boyfriends in and out of her life. I
[15:08] just seen her getting roughed up and
[15:09] beat up a lot. And you know, seeing all
[15:10] that kind of stuff and uh you know, that
[15:12] that left impacts on you, you know,
[15:14] seeing that kind of stuff at them young
[15:17] ages like that. And uh but as I grew up,
[15:20] you know, I had a bad temper. You know,
[15:22] I would fight a buzz saw like brother
[15:23] Brandham said. I would fight anything.
[15:25] you looked at me wrong, you know, and
[15:26] and you know, I just had that fighting
[15:28] spirit to me, you know, and I, you know,
[15:29] I had a brother one time, I heard him
[15:31] preaching and, you know, he said,
[15:32] "Sometimes God deliver you from all
[15:34] that, but leave a little bit of that
[15:35] natural characteristic in there for you
[15:37] to fight for the Holy Ghost." And I
[15:39] believe that's what he left a little bit
[15:40] of that fighting nature in me to fight
[15:41] for him, you know, and stand for the
[15:44] stand for the Lord Jesus Christ, you
[15:45] know, and I mean, I ain't got to that
[15:47] yet, but I never could speak in public.
[15:49] I was not no public speaker. I never
[15:51] could testify, you know. A good example,
[15:53] my buddy asked me to uh uh be uh be the
[15:56] best man in his wedding. He asked me to
[15:58] give the best man speech. I got ready to
[16:00] get up there and uh the the the maiden,
[16:04] whatever you call her, she she the maid
[16:05] of honor, she done got up and man, she
[16:08] done killed it with this long good
[16:10] testimony for them. Then I got up and
[16:12] had some notes and I'm getting up there
[16:13] and I started to serve a few and next
[16:15] thing I know I fold it up and put it in
[16:16] my pocket and pretty much blank out.
[16:18] Couldn't get nothing going and and it
[16:20] pretty much felt like I made myself look
[16:21] like an idiot. Well, like I said, I
[16:23] could never speak in public. I couldn't
[16:24] ever get up and testify as much as I
[16:26] wanted to, but you know, by God's grace,
[16:29] you know, he said, "Waiting to your dude
[16:31] with power from on high, then try to
[16:33] strengthen that, brethren." And so, I
[16:35] can witness [music] and testify that the
[16:37] Holy Ghost can give you the courage and
[16:38] give you the strength to do what you got
[16:40] to do in when you have a time need to do
[16:42] it. So, but I was always that was the
[16:45] way I was, you know. I was always into
[16:47] extreme sports. I love skating, biking,
[16:49] bike, dirt biking. I raced dirt bikes
[16:51] and played football. I love football.
[16:53] And you know, I was a daredevil. You
[16:55] know, I like just pushing the edge. You
[16:57] know, I broke both both legs, broke some
[16:59] ribs. I was always in and out of trouble
[17:01] all my life. It was just a lifestyle to
[17:02] me. You know, everything I did, you
[17:05] know, I I can tell you I was in
[17:06] elementary school, I got in so much
[17:07] trouble in elementary school, they sent
[17:09] me to middle school uh detention. I got
[17:11] so much when I got to middle school, I
[17:12] got in so much trouble in the middle
[17:14] school, they sent me the high school
[17:15] detention. I got and eventually I got to
[17:17] where you know I graduated from a a
[17:20] county inmate to a state inmate when you
[17:23] know but you know God by the time I was
[17:26] 15 years old is when I began to smoke
[17:28] cigarettes and drink and and do drugs
[17:30] and stuff. I had my first drinking party
[17:32] when I was 15 years old. You know, you
[17:34] know, they would rather me get drunk at
[17:35] home and do all that versus out running
[17:37] the roads, you know. So, made it okay
[17:39] for me to start doing that. And, you
[17:40] know, my over-the-top nature. I love
[17:42] getting high and love getting drunk, you
[17:44] know, because I love that adrenaline
[17:45] rush. I love the endorphins. You know,
[17:47] we know now what that is that them
[17:49] endorphin release, you know, when I can
[17:50] sit there and get drunk, get high and,
[17:52] you know, instant gratification. I
[17:53] didn't have to do no work for it.
[17:55] Looking back, I can see the change in my
[17:57] life when I started become a drug
[17:58] addict, you know, and started uh, you
[18:00] know, seeing them things, you know, and
[18:02] and and that's why I say to you kids in
[18:04] here to find fellowship and stay in
[18:05] fellowship with believers and
[18:07] Christians, you know, and and find
[18:09] friends and, you know, like my mom
[18:10] always used to say, you hang out with
[18:12] dogs, you're going to get fleas, you
[18:13] know, and you know, the devil offers you
[18:15] nothing but death.
[18:17] &gt;&gt; It's nothing but emptiness. I'm an
[18:18] eyewitness. I did all that he had to
[18:20] offer and it was empty and leave you for
[18:22] hungering for more. The devil will get
[18:24] you to rob the bank and call the law on
[18:26] you because he hates you. He's just
[18:28] going to use you like a little
[18:29] instrument.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; You know, you know, but I'm a witness
[18:33] that this fire in my bones better than
[18:35] any drug, any drink, anything you can
[18:37] go, he can offer you
[18:39] &gt;&gt; because it offers you peace. It passes
[18:42] understanding and joy unspeakable and
[18:44] full of glory because you know where
[18:45] you're going. Glory to God.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; You know, and it's so it's so awesome,
[18:50] you know. And and what I encourage you
[18:52] to do is, you know what I've done since
[18:53] God just fired me all the way up. You
[18:56] read your Bible more, you pray,
[18:58] &gt;&gt; go to church,
[18:59] &gt;&gt; stream some sermons,
[19:02] &gt;&gt; get plugged in with your local believers
[19:03] that you can find some fellowship and
[19:05] have fun. We love to fellowship. God
[19:07] created us, you know, to have fellowship
[19:08] with one another,
[19:10] &gt;&gt; you know, and it's hard sometimes
[19:11] because we can build up complexes in
[19:13] this day and age, you know, the, you
[19:15] know, we're fighting more than giants of
[19:16] sex, drugs, and rock and roll anymore.
[19:19] We're fighting giants of pornography.
[19:21] We're fighting giants of Instagram where
[19:23] this Instagram maybe this Instagram reel
[19:25] made this girl look so attractive that
[19:27] it made this boy lust after her. That
[19:29] this in same Instagram real made this
[19:32] girl feel insecure about herself cuz
[19:34] she's not as pretty as this girl and
[19:36] this and that. You see, we're battling
[19:37] all these insecurities complexes. You
[19:39] know, the greatest battle ever falls up
[19:41] here in the mind. So, the devil's
[19:43] attacking it through that channel and
[19:44] we, you know, and it's just the way it
[19:46] is. Yeah.
[19:47] &gt;&gt; So, we know we got to we got to we got
[19:48] to fight what we're putting in our mind.
[19:51] Guard the battlefield. Get the get the
[19:53] get the great soldier, the Holy Ghost
[19:55] right here in the forefront of the mind,
[19:56] battling with you, helping you.
[19:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[20:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; I liked it like this, too. You can
[20:06] remember hitting the faith gym. You go,
[20:08] you go to the gym and hit the weights.
[20:10] You go hit you go you go get you some
[20:12] cardio in. You trying to get stronger,
[20:13] right? You trying to do these things.
[20:14] You training. Same thing with reading
[20:16] your Bible. You're reading your Bible,
[20:18] you're praying, you're hitting the faith
[20:19] gym. Remember that I didn't go hit the
[20:20] faith gym today,
[20:22] &gt;&gt; you know,
[20:23] &gt;&gt; and you know, and and as I've witnessed
[20:25] to people, I' i've talked to people and
[20:26] they're like, you know, I don't have
[20:27] some great testimony like you. I never
[20:29] went into drugs. I never did all them
[20:31] things. You know, that's such a greater
[20:33] testimony that God has kept you.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; And you ought to cherish that and
[20:38] realize and see that it's a blessing.
[20:41] You don't want all these scars and all
[20:42] these things that you got to go through
[20:43] when you go out there in the devil's
[20:45] playground. So, I encourage you to just
[20:47] stay in fellowship with the Lord
[20:49] &gt;&gt; and his people.
[20:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[20:50] &gt;&gt; So, by the time I was a senior, uh I
[20:53] always like to do crazy stuff, you know,
[20:55] and uh by the time I was a senior in
[20:58] high school, I got in a fight with a
[20:59] with a girl and then I got in a fight
[21:01] with a principal and quit school. school
[21:02] wound up getting quit in school and you
[21:04] know I was riding around one of my
[21:06] buddies this night and uh he he had got
[21:08] hurt and got some money from a
[21:10] settlement. Well that night I was I was
[21:12] riding around with him and I was like
[21:13] you know I was like man I wish I could
[21:14] get hurt and get some money like you and
[21:16] and I say that to say be careful what
[21:18] you wish for. The next day me and my dad
[21:20] we woke up and we got my stepdad and we
[21:22] got we got in a fight and we we wound up
[21:24] going. and he drops me off at work and
[21:26] uh I'm there and the next thing I know I
[21:28] hear this big explosion and I'm like I'm
[21:30] I'm uh the grease fryers at Arby's got
[21:33] knocked all over me and I was I was
[21:35] burned my all all that and I was trying
[21:37] to get up and uh going out the back door
[21:40] and and I got out the back door and when
[21:42] I got out the back door I was trying to
[21:43] take my clothes off and and then boom
[21:45] that same car come in reverse and nailed
[21:47] the the the order and sign and kept me
[21:49] from uh getting hit and uh I wound up
[21:53] having thirdderee burns all my whole
[21:55] back and the back of my arm and all that
[21:56] and all my face had second degree burns
[21:59] in my arms and chest and stuff like
[22:00] that. But they they took all the skin
[22:02] off my legs and I was in the hospital
[22:04] for about a month. And you know, at that
[22:06] point in life, you know, I was thinking
[22:07] money was going to buy my happiness. And
[22:09] it was like that, you know, I wound up
[22:10] getting a little money from that
[22:11] settlement obviously, you know, and and
[22:13] as I was going through it, you know, I
[22:15] wound up seeing how empty I still was.
[22:17] No matter what, me and my buddies, we
[22:19] still did the same old things. No matter
[22:20] what, I end up just wasting my money and
[22:23] doing all that stuff, you know, and and
[22:24] you know, it just uh it was a blessing
[22:27] that I didn't get as much money as they
[22:28] told me I would have because I'd
[22:29] probably be dead right now. you would
[22:30] never seen me. But but you know, me and
[22:33] my buddies, we took a little I took a
[22:34] little bit of that money and we started
[22:35] a flooring business cuz my stepdad has a
[22:38] flooring store and we started doing
[22:39] flooring and stuff and uh I wound up
[22:42] buying my tools and everything and I
[22:43] wound up I'll tell you a crazy story.
[22:46] One time I I bought this car and I was
[22:48] coming out of Russellville and I was
[22:49] coming down through her and this this
[22:51] car comes up behind me and starts
[22:52] flashing his lights and uh he was
[22:54] flashing his lights and and I was like,
[22:56] "Oh no, I'm getting pulled over." And I
[22:58] I actually start to pull over a little
[22:59] bit and then the car pulls around me and
[23:01] I see it was like a SUV and it was like
[23:03] people they was wanting to get out and I
[23:04] start so I mat on it and start going
[23:06] flying down through there and when I'm
[23:07] going down through there uh I'm flying
[23:09] down through there and uh [snorts] uh uh
[23:12] I'm this car ends up flying back up
[23:14] beside me like that and they end up
[23:16] throwing this stuff out. I don't know
[23:17] what it was, but it made it almost look
[23:19] like smoke and and uh uh dust. And I
[23:21] wound up yanking it around there. And
[23:23] then they end up flying up back by me.
[23:24] And this guy was hanging out the window
[23:26] with a a pipe and a pipe wrench or
[23:28] something like that. And I end up I end
[23:30] up I had a I had a little plet pistol
[23:32] beside me. It looked just like a real 9
[23:34] millimeter. I pull this plet pistol up
[23:36] and then old boy pulls up a pistol. I'm
[23:38] like, whoa. And I put that back down,
[23:40] you know, and I end up uh I end up I end
[23:42] up passing them, dude. I went flying
[23:44] down through her. I was coming up to the
[23:45] caution light and when I come up to the
[23:46] caution light I hit the E brake whipped
[23:48] it around in the road and come flying
[23:50] back at them and they ran off the road
[23:51] playing chicken with them ran I wound up
[23:54] running them off the road and then I I
[23:55] went down the road and come back around
[23:56] flying they out there just yelling
[23:58] screaming I went flying past them wound
[24:00] up going down through there and looping
[24:01] around and going back around and come up
[24:03] to this spot and then went down in this
[24:04] field and was up to no good back there
[24:06] and I sit there for a while I seen them
[24:08] there and then then they end up leaving
[24:09] and I end up leaving and then here come
[24:12] a car flying up behind me and as I was
[24:13] coming up through her. I seen it. I was
[24:15] like, "Oh, no. That's a that's a cop,
[24:17] man." And I wound up I went up I set the
[24:19] cruise and kept on going straight down
[24:20] through there and I was going I was
[24:22] getting my drugs and everything in my
[24:24] cigarette pack and wound up I got ready
[24:26] to turn in here when he he had me lit up
[24:28] and I had my cruise set. When I went up
[24:30] to turn in here, I threw my cigarette
[24:31] pack out. It slid up under a a leaf as
[24:34] he was pulling in. And uh they end up
[24:37] getting me out and they was like,
[24:38] "People been down here stealing an
[24:40] hydras." They got me. I'm like, "Y'all
[24:41] didn't hear that commot." Yeah. They was
[24:42] like, "We didn't know what that was."
[24:43] cuz I was like, man, they was trying to
[24:44] carjack me and they end up pulling my
[24:46] speakers out, pulling everything out.
[24:48] And uh it was just a crazy time that God
[24:51] kept me when they could have shot me,
[24:52] killed me, hit me head on, you know, and
[24:54] and just even in my ignorance, God kept
[24:56] me, you know, down through that, man.
[24:58] And you know, it's crazy. I could tell
[25:00] you stories for days of all the stupid
[25:03] and crazy stuff, but we're not going to
[25:04] go down through all that. But it's just
[25:06] always one of the stories that stuck out
[25:07] to me that, man, if you could only seen
[25:09] that night, God's hand of protection was
[25:11] on me.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh you know it was a little
[25:14] bit later uh I was uh I was invited to
[25:18] church. I hadn't been to church in a
[25:19] long time and uh I the night before uh I
[25:24] wound up and was out doing a bunch of
[25:26] stuff. But needless to say I was I I
[25:28] went to church and God was dealing with
[25:30] me. This is the first time at this point
[25:31] in my life. Uh now we're moving on. I'm
[25:34] probably about 20 21 something like
[25:36] that. Uh, and uh, this is the first time
[25:40] God
[25:41] No, I was going to say 20. Yeah, 20. It
[25:44] don't matter. But anyway, uh, so I'm in
[25:48] this church and God's dealing with me.
[25:49] This is the first time, you know,
[25:50] something like God's ever kind of really
[25:52] pulling at me. Well, I end up, you know,
[25:55] fighting through all that. I end up
[25:56] seeing this guy go up with a guitar. I'm
[25:58] like, this guy going up there with a
[26:00] guitar, you know. I'm like, yeah,
[26:02] whatever. Gets up there, sings his heart
[26:04] out, man. It wounds up just pulling on
[26:06] my heartstrings, too. But I fought
[26:08] through all that. You know, at the altar
[26:09] call at the end, I left. I got going
[26:11] down the road, and this is the first
[26:12] time I heard this the Lord speak to me.
[26:14] Uh uh he said, "You're walking away from
[26:17] God." And something right there. I
[26:19] instantly I broke in under conviction,
[26:21] turned my truck around. I didn't know. I
[26:23] just had to get back and find that that
[26:25] preacher. I went back and went back in
[26:27] there and and wound up finding him. And
[26:28] he led me in there and led me to the
[26:30] Lord. And uh you know, God that day, I
[26:33] remember just being in in awe the rest
[26:35] of that day. I can tell you uh because
[26:37] of where I was. But God put an anchor
[26:39] down in my soul right there. He drove
[26:41] that anchor so deep that no matter how
[26:43] hard I tried to go the other way, he
[26:45] never let me go. He never let me go. And
[26:48] I can tell you and I can assure you that
[26:49] I tried to get away as much as I
[26:51] possibly could. [snorts] But God, he's
[26:54] faithful.
[26:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[26:57] &gt;&gt; He's watching over us.
[26:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. you know, but you know, a lot
[27:00] of times it's got to get worse before it
[27:02] gets better. You know, kind of like the
[27:04] old white dog, black dog story.
[27:07] [clears throat]
[27:08] Uh,
[27:10] you know, I I I began to I began to
[27:12] just, uh, spiral out of control more and
[27:15] more. Uh, I became to use more drugs
[27:20] than I had before. I was just had to I
[27:22] had backslid. I'm sorry. Uh, got off my
[27:25] notes here. But uh
[27:28] I I went down to w after I had gave my
[27:30] heart to the Lord. It was probably about
[27:32] two weeks later. I had already at this
[27:34] time I had kind of uh just uh been
[27:37] spending a little bit of time with the
[27:38] Lord more. You know, I've never done
[27:40] anything like this. I just felt like
[27:42] reading my Bible and stuff like that for
[27:43] about two weeks after that. And I wasn't
[27:46] hanging out with my friends. I would go
[27:47] work. I'd come home and I'm like, you
[27:49] know, I want to go tell my buddies about
[27:50] the Lord and what he's done for me. And
[27:52] I'm down there, you know, and uh I'm
[27:54] down there and start to witnessing to
[27:56] them. And uh one one of my friends uh
[28:00] aunts starts being like, you know, she's
[28:02] like, "Oh, I go to the bars and I go to
[28:04] the bars and witness to people and this
[28:06] and that." I'm like, "Really?" And I
[28:07] was, you know, and I, you know, that
[28:09] that's kind of hitting me. And she's
[28:10] like, "Oh, yeah, this and that." And you
[28:11] know, at this point, I'd already been
[28:13] kind of thinking a little bit about I
[28:15] think I'd even looked up trying to find
[28:16] what I could like uh pot, weed, alcohol,
[28:21] trying to find [laughter] in there I
[28:22] could almost justify to maybe, you know,
[28:25] a little bit, you know, maybe a little
[28:26] bit. So anyway, I'm down there and next
[28:28] thing I know, I I smoked a little bit.
[28:30] And I say all that to say because next
[28:32] thing I know, I'm running backwards
[28:33] worse than I ever had because I stepped
[28:35] away from that still small voice. And
[28:37] you know, and then I I started getting
[28:39] worse and worse and and you know, uh uh
[28:42] I was feeding that black dog, you know,
[28:43] and I I was out drunk, real bad drunk
[28:46] one night and I wound up getting in a
[28:47] bad motorcycle wreck at the end of my
[28:49] road and it was a miracle. I went down
[28:51] the inner road. My friends that they
[28:52] dropped me off. I come back and wound up
[28:55] blowing their doors out running them and
[28:57] got down over this and done a donut at
[28:59] the end of the road and started coming
[29:00] back up the hill. And when I was coming
[29:01] up the hill, I could see their lights
[29:02] coming. I'm like, "Oh, I need to scoot
[29:04] over a little it. And when I did, I
[29:05] passed them and then the road went out
[29:07] from under me and it was a curve there.
[29:09] And when I came back up on the black
[29:10] top, you could see later. And I flipped
[29:12] end over end down through the the
[29:14] opposite side of the road, trees and
[29:16] fences down through there. And you know,
[29:18] just that little bit from here to there,
[29:20] flipped my motorcycle down through there
[29:21] and God kept me. I woke up the next day
[29:24] at like just crack of daylight and I'm
[29:25] like, "Oh." I didn't have no shirt on,
[29:27] chest all raw, face so sweat up, I
[29:29] couldn't even talk, like one shoe. I was
[29:30] like dislocated shoulder. And I'm
[29:32] walking down through her and I'm like,
[29:33] oh man, there's my motorcycle. And then
[29:36] I go to get on. I'm like, maybe I can
[29:37] limp this thing home. Bars bent down in
[29:39] the tank. Maybe I can limp this thing
[29:40] home. And I go to pick it up. And the
[29:42] keys wasn't even in it. They in my
[29:43] pocket. So apparently I tried to do
[29:45] something that night. I don't know. And
[29:46] then here just so happened that day my
[29:48] stepdad was going to help his dad that
[29:50] morning. And here he come around the
[29:52] curve and wound up. He he he he thought
[29:55] I was going to die. My mom will always
[29:57] tell you to this day that that he just
[29:59] don't know. He thought I was going to
[30:00] die, man. But the grace of God kept me
[30:02] there, you know. He had a work to do in
[30:04] my life, you know. And it was about two
[30:06] weeks after that, after all my black
[30:08] eyes and my swelling go down, I'm like,
[30:10] man, I ain't been in church in a minute.
[30:11] I'm like, you know, I'm going to go over
[30:13] here. I'm going to go to my buddy's
[30:14] church. They're a bunch of weirdos, but
[30:15] I'm going to go over there. You know,
[30:17] and I can say I'm one of them now.
[30:18] [laughter]
[30:19] I'm an oddball now. You know, sir,
[30:22] &gt;&gt; you know, at that time, you know, here I
[30:23] am. I got tattoos. I look like Hell's
[30:25] Angels coming up in here. I got tattoos
[30:27] and earrings and everything else. And
[30:29] this is Holy Ghost filled people, you
[30:31] know, with with skirts on and long hair.
[30:33] I'm like, you know, it's it's weird to
[30:36] me, [laughter]
[30:37] you [snorts] know, and uh but you know,
[30:40] by God's grace, you know, I actually
[30:42] seen my wife there and and it was
[30:45] probably about two weeks I I kept
[30:47] thinking about this girl, man. And I
[30:49] reached out to one of my buddies. I'm
[30:50] like, I don't even know how to talk to a
[30:51] good girl. Maybe [laughter] maybe you
[30:53] can get her number for me, man. And uh
[30:55] anyway, I got her number and she's my
[30:57] wife of beautiful wife of 19 years now.
[31:01] &gt;&gt; Uh it kind of it kind of she kind of
[31:04] helped me keep going to church too. And
[31:06] you know I was rebaptized and you know
[31:08] I'm going speed it up. You know we got
[31:10] married and had a son and uh I began to
[31:13] you know I I at this point you know now
[31:15] I have all these responsibilities
[31:17] you know and and and [music]
[31:19] now I'm getting worse and worse. Now I
[31:21] start using meth regular because I work
[31:23] for myself. I I become a full-blown
[31:25] alcoholic. I I was drinking beer as soon
[31:27] as I woke up. I woke up. I mean,
[31:29] literally cussing, mad at the world. My
[31:31] wife can tell you stories they couldn't
[31:32] tell why somebody could be so angry. I
[31:34] hated life. I I just didn't know why I
[31:37] was still here. But I had this turmoil
[31:38] in me because I knew there was something
[31:39] real out there. I believe now I'm trying
[31:41] to fix something. Before I was content,
[31:44] you know, even though I mean, you know,
[31:45] I have bad days, but I told you I loved
[31:47] getting high. That's what I did, you
[31:49] know. But when God came in there and I
[31:51] tasted the real life, oh son, once I
[31:54] backslid, there was never I was always
[31:56] trying to get back to that. And so now I
[31:59] start I started amping it up. I start
[32:01] turning it up and I'm running from my
[32:02] responsibilities. [music] Life is
[32:04] mounding up on me. It's getting bad, you
[32:06] know. [snorts] And uh you know, the
[32:08] adult dope game is death, hell, or death
[32:11] or prison eventually. You know, I got a
[32:13] brother that's been in in the pin now
[32:15] for years. I got a sister that committed
[32:17] suicide a couple years ago. and and you
[32:20] know I know where the dope game will
[32:21] take you to the grave
[32:24] and uh now uh uh I'm going worse and I'm
[32:29] going I'm going out of control and you
[32:31] know I I got I even got a little bit a
[32:34] aggressive with my wife you know and I
[32:36] didn't got I didn't got so jealous and
[32:38] controlling over over her because you
[32:40] know lacking my respon I ain't being a
[32:42] husband I am you know and all these you
[32:44] know insecurities and fears and all this
[32:47] stuff mounding up in my life, you know,
[32:50] my life was just complete darkness and
[32:52] you know, and it was just empty and and
[32:55] you [snorts] know, and to be where I was
[32:56] at, you know, I can go back there and as
[32:59] crazy it as it is. I got 13 years drugs
[33:01] and alcohol free now and and it seemed
[33:04] like it was just yesterday, you know,
[33:06] and it's just like, you know, I can tell
[33:07] you it's as though I lived two lives.
[33:09] And when I say that, I can say I have
[33:11] lived two lives because that old man is
[33:13] dead.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; And now I'm a new creature, a bornagain
[33:16] creature in Christ Jesus. Woo. It'll put
[33:19] a fire in your bones [snorts] because
[33:21] you when you can go back to the darkness
[33:22] that I was and where I was, it was just
[33:26] nothing but emptiness.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; But I got so bad at this time. I I
[33:31] started telling my wife to just stay
[33:33] over their moms. I didn't even want her
[33:34] to come home, you know? I didn't even
[33:36] want them to come home because I'm like,
[33:38] you know, the chaos that it was around
[33:40] me and everything and and uh it's just
[33:43] crazy. But one night I got on a big
[33:45] drunk big tangent and I went over my
[33:47] buddies. that actually I was on the way
[33:48] to my buddies cuz I done got hammered
[33:50] and I'm supposed to be helping him do
[33:51] some tile tomorrow. I actually done quit
[33:53] my job where I did work and now I'm
[33:55] helping this guy. And so now I'm on the
[33:57] way to my buddies and my my bread truck.
[33:59] I had an old bunny bread truck, if y'all
[34:01] know what them are, them little panel
[34:02] vans. I had a bunny bread truck I did my
[34:04] flooring out of. And I'm on the way over
[34:06] there. I told my buddy, I said, "I'll be
[34:07] there. I'm just going to sleep in your
[34:08] driveway tonight." He's like, "No, man.
[34:10] Come on in." And I'm on the way over
[34:11] there and I remember so actually I had
[34:14] another part where I had kind of fixed
[34:15] my motorcycle back up but it was never
[34:17] legal. I was never legal. I was driving
[34:19] on suspended all these years. I was
[34:22] pulling a trailer at one point all the
[34:23] time covering my license plate because I
[34:25] was riding illegal all the time. Didn't
[34:27] want nobody see my plates. Anyway, so
[34:29] here I am on the way over here and then
[34:31] it dawns on me. Oh man, I got my I gave
[34:34] him my motorcycle so I wouldn't be
[34:36] riding a stupid thing. I'm on the way
[34:37] over and it dawns on me. [laughter] I
[34:39] got the keys. I got a key to that
[34:41] motorcycle, man. And I told Tammy, I
[34:43] told her, I got over the motorcycle for
[34:45] her. I said, "I'm on the way. I'm coming
[34:46] to see you tonight." Because I done got
[34:48] in a big fight. She's mad at me.
[34:50] [snorts] And uh she she actually can
[34:52] tell you today she told me, "Don't don't
[34:53] come." And here I am. Like I done hung
[34:55] up on her, son. I'm coming over to
[34:57] visit. It's late night. And uh I'm
[34:59] [snorts] on the way over coming down
[35:02] through her. And I wound up going I was
[35:04] coming in town. I come up to this light
[35:05] and I I didn't have no plates on here.
[35:07] And I'm up at this light and all I had
[35:08] was a rigged up headlight in the front
[35:10] in in the dome of a headlight where it
[35:12] was all busted. I just rigged a
[35:13] headlight up so I could have something.
[35:15] I even rode my motorcycle with a
[35:16] flashlight before. And I'm sitting there
[35:18] and I'm and I'm I'm up here at the
[35:20] stoplight and I see this the police over
[35:22] here and I'm like I'm like, "Oh no." And
[35:24] then here he he winds up coming over
[35:25] behind me and I'm going out through
[35:27] there. I'm trying to just ride and he
[35:28] lights me up and I'm like so I just drop
[35:31] the hammer. I drop some gears. I start
[35:33] hammering. I'm flying down through
[35:34] there. I'm flying. I'm going through. I
[35:36] bust through that four-way and go
[35:37] through there. And at this time, I
[35:38] realized I don't even know where I'm at.
[35:39] I need to get turned back around, get
[35:40] spun back around. So, I'm going down
[35:42] through there. And I was like, I need to
[35:43] turn around here. And when I went to
[35:44] hammer on the brakes and went to turn, I
[35:46] didn't have no brake light. All I heard,
[35:48] [screaming]
[35:48] he locked up. I looked at him and I
[35:50] looked back over my shoulder and he was
[35:52] about to plow me. And I gouged it and
[35:53] went around this light pole here and
[35:54] whip whipped it back around and come
[35:56] down through there and was flying back
[35:57] down through there. And I went on down
[35:59] through I seen a 100 sign and I thought
[36:01] it was telling me I need to go there. I
[36:03] blow through that and I realized no that
[36:05] was the truck route 100. That was the
[36:07] 100 I just went through again. I don't
[36:08] even know this. So now I mean I went
[36:11] that this next light I just had to run
[36:12] it and I'm wide open at this point and
[36:14] the the the police officer tell you and
[36:16] you could see it man I was dragging
[36:18] sparks where I had the frame dragging
[36:19] taking this curve. I'm flying down
[36:21] through there going down through there
[36:22] in front of Walmart and Lowe's and all
[36:24] that and I'm going down through there
[36:25] and it wound up being so many cars. You
[36:27] ain't ever in your life seen a whole
[36:28] line of cars. I look back and see like
[36:31] four or five policemen lying down
[36:33] through there. So then I just hit the
[36:34] yellow line and made them park the the
[36:36] cars were just parting out of my way
[36:38] like that and I was flying out through
[36:39] there and I went to go I needed to get
[36:41] turned around again because I don't know
[36:42] where I'm at. I went to turn around and
[36:44] when I went in this parking lot I did a
[36:45] tank slapper and it hit the ground and
[36:47] wound up sliding and I just knew I'm
[36:49] like okay it's over. I laid there they
[36:51] they pulled in there. You ain't never
[36:53] heard so many sirens in all your life.
[36:54] And he was yelling screaming at me. He
[36:56] had the guns on me and he told me he was
[36:57] going to shoot me if I got up and tried
[36:58] to run on foot. But by the grace of God,
[37:01] he kept me in the wreck. He kept me from
[37:03] hurting anybody. He kept me from hurting
[37:05] myself. And you know, I wrecked out and
[37:08] and surrendered. And I say all that
[37:11] because that was where God really
[37:12] started dealing with me. You know, after
[37:14] I went through a all the all the court
[37:16] process and all that, I wound up in
[37:18] jail. And I'm locked up. And I'm in
[37:20] there probably about a month. I'm in
[37:22] there probably about a month and I'm
[37:24] just going through it, you know, cuz now
[37:25] here here I am. My wife's out here. I
[37:27] don't know what she's doing. You know,
[37:28] like I said, I had that controlling
[37:30] spirit and at this time and jealousy and
[37:32] and my temper and everything and now you
[37:35] take the drugs and alcohol and tobacco
[37:37] and all that away from me too, all at
[37:38] the same time. Here I am, man. I'm going
[37:40] through it. I remember just laying there
[37:41] belly crying in the bed, you know,
[37:43] because I want to be tough. We're in
[37:44] jail. You don't want to, you know, look
[37:45] soft or nothing. So, I'm belly crying
[37:47] under my my blanket over here, crying
[37:49] out to God. I'm so mad at God cuz at any
[37:51] time you could have done anything. All I
[37:54] wanted to be was a good husband and a
[37:56] good dad. You know, I grew up in this
[37:57] broken home and I wanted to be there for
[37:59] my son. I wanted to be there for my wife
[38:01] and I just wanted to be good and I
[38:03] can't. And then he he spoke to my heart
[38:05] right then. He said, "You got nobody
[38:06] else to blame, so you're blaming me?"
[38:08] And I said, "I'm sorry, God. It's
[38:11] nobody's fault but mine." And I believe
[38:13] something happened right there and I'll
[38:15] never forget it as long as I live. I
[38:16] woke up the next, you know, I cried out
[38:18] that night. I couldn't tell you the rest
[38:19] of that night, but I woke up the next
[38:20] day and opened the Bible. My my finger
[38:23] landed on my grace is sufficient for
[38:24] thee. Therefore, my strength is made
[38:26] perfect. And I was reading that and I
[38:28] just flipped it again. And he said,
[38:30] "There's no fear in love. For perfect
[38:32] love cast out fear and that God was,
[38:35] that's when God was really dealing with
[38:37] me on fear." He had already he had
[38:39] already had had these other brothers
[38:40] talking beforehand. I I kind of caught
[38:42] easedropping there that when they was
[38:44] going through it uh this and that. He
[38:46] said, "He who fears tries to control
[38:47] everything around him." And and you
[38:50] know, I have I have no fear tattooed on
[38:52] me. I thought I was the most fearless,
[38:54] but you know, and it I realized then I
[38:56] had more fears of looking like so I'd go
[38:58] out here and fight anybody. Why? Because
[39:00] I I didn't want to look like a punk. I
[39:02] didn't want to look like a oh yeah, he
[39:04] whooped me. So I would drive that fear.
[39:06] So God was really deal dealing with me
[39:08] on fear. See, but then he started to
[39:10] deal with me that that, you know, on
[39:12] trusting my wife, you know, if I could
[39:14] only trust him, I didn't necessarily
[39:16] have to trust her. I could trust him to
[39:18] make all things right. And so God
[39:20] started dealing with me. And it was then
[39:21] he delivered me from my jealousy. He
[39:24] delivered me from drugs, alcohol, took
[39:27] all that uh uh desire from me. Uh 12
[39:31] years of drugs and alcohol right there.
[39:33] Uh I said 13 years while ago. That was
[39:36] that was crazy. Uh,
[39:40] no, no. Yeah. 13 years about got 13
[39:44] years confusing me now. 12 years of
[39:46] drugs and alcohol abuse. Now I'm 13
[39:48] years clean. So I'm one year past longer
[39:50] than I used. [laughter]
[39:53] Yeah. I was confused for a second like
[39:54] what? Uh but uh so you know uh
[40:00] uh God started dealing with me on uh on
[40:03] these things, you know, as I laid there,
[40:05] you know, and as we see God, you know,
[40:08] uh uh I've said all that.
[40:12] So I I'm in I'm in jail, you know, I'm
[40:14] going through it in there at this point
[40:16] now. Before I wouldn't I wouldn't take
[40:18] no treatment programs. I wasn't going to
[40:19] no halfway house. I wasn't going to no a
[40:22] drug court, you know. So, I'm going to
[40:24] do my time, you know, and now God's
[40:26] dealt with me. You know what I'm saying?
[40:28] I'm I'm like, I got to get out here and
[40:29] take care of my family. I need to do
[40:31] what I need to do. So, then I start
[40:32] getting on there trying to get it. And
[40:34] so, then they end up shocking me out. I
[40:35] go through this [music] two-year drug
[40:36] court program. She made me get my GED
[40:39] and do all these different things. And,
[40:41] you know, I had to go through
[40:42] bankruptcy. I had a bunch of back taxes
[40:44] and a bunch of uh doctor bills and all
[40:46] these crazy things. But, you know, God
[40:47] helped me because he's a restorer of all
[40:49] things. my marriage, my my wife, she can
[40:52] tell you she was right there at the end.
[40:54] If I if I wouldn't have got out and made
[40:55] any changes, she had to see it for
[40:57] herself, you know, because I could say a
[40:59] lot of things, but until she seen some
[41:01] real fruit from it. So, but by God's
[41:04] grace, I got out and uh he's restored my
[41:07] marriage, made it better than I could
[41:09] imagine. She's so awesome. Best wife any
[41:12] man could ask for. And uh I know y'all
[41:16] might want to, but for me [laughter]
[41:20] and my house, we going to serve the
[41:21] Lord. Woo.
[41:23] That was good, you know. But uh
[41:27] uh we got out and started rebuilding our
[41:30] business and renting a place and you
[41:32] know, and uh with God all things are
[41:34] possible, you know. And little by
[41:36] little, he said he would drive out the
[41:37] Amorites, you know. He said, "I'll I'll
[41:40] let you move and move in and take it
[41:42] over, and I I if you'll kill out this
[41:45] little bunch of Hivites, I'll let you
[41:46] move in and take over. You know, we're
[41:48] going to keep taking over, right?"
[41:49] [snorts] And uh he helped me overcome
[41:52] the giant of drugs and alcohol and lust
[41:55] and all these. And little by little, the
[41:57] sanctification process. And I'm sitting
[41:59] in church one day and God starts dealing
[42:01] with me. And you know, at this point, I
[42:03] still smoked cigarettes. And I I still I
[42:05] still had tobacco in my life. And at
[42:07] this point, God started started dealing
[42:08] with me. And you know, while Peter yet
[42:10] spake them words, the Holy Ghost fell.
[42:12] And I'm sitting there and and he said,
[42:14] "Why don't you quit smoking today?" And
[42:15] I said, "I can't quit smoking today. I'm
[42:17] going to Papa's." I said, "Everybody," I
[42:19] said, "Everybody in my family smokes."
[42:20] He said, "Why don't you hang out with
[42:22] like faith?" And I said, "I will." And
[42:23] instantly, God delivered me in 19 years
[42:26] of smoking cigarettes and never smoked
[42:28] again. And uh and God is the same
[42:32] yesterday, today, and forever. if you
[42:33] have any strongholds, he he's more than
[42:35] able to deliver you.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; You know, and uh uh
[42:42] and I hit a spot, I like to say, where
[42:44] it's like uh uh probably one of the
[42:47] harder spots in life where you go go
[42:49] years of just going through the motions
[42:51] of living a Christian life, of not
[42:54] really knowing what life's about, just
[42:57] going to church, doing my duties. I
[42:58] might go once or twice a month, never
[43:00] know Wednesdays. Not that I really
[43:02] remember going. I might have went one
[43:04] here and there for all the years I ever
[43:06] went to church, but you know, it was
[43:09] tooth and nail to get to them when I did
[43:10] come to church. But so
[43:14] uh
[43:18] when I was just going through the
[43:19] motions, uh you know, Brother Brandham
[43:20] said, "Sometimes God will lay us on our
[43:22] back to see where our great blessings
[43:23] come from." And one night I had a a
[43:25] crazy pain hit me and uh they wound we
[43:28] wound up, you know, I won't forget my
[43:30] wife. We're sitting there and I'm like,
[43:32] uh, I'm going through it and she's like,
[43:35] you know, she's wanting to take me in
[43:37] and I'm like, no. I said I I go
[43:39] downstairs. I'm I'm going through it.
[43:40] I'm getting away from her. She comes
[43:41] down there. She's all got her clothes on
[43:43] like, "We're going to the hospital." I
[43:44] said, "No." I said, "What do you think
[43:45] the Cowboys did?" She said, "They died.
[43:47] [laughter] I won't ever forget that."
[43:49] But I'm like, I'm sitting down there
[43:51] after she stomped back out there mad at
[43:52] me, you know. I'm like, "She could be
[43:54] right." You know, and so they all wound
[43:56] up going and I went to there and he's
[43:58] like, "Man, that sounds like a
[43:59] dissection." And I'm like, I didn't know
[44:01] what that was. And he starts going on
[44:03] telling me, you know, then I get on a
[44:04] Google and then you start sweating
[44:05] bullets. Is is this what it really is?
[44:08] Then they wind up saying, "Yep, it is.
[44:09] Now we're going to have to get So then
[44:10] they am me. Then they lifelight me. Then
[44:13] they get me in there. And when they get
[44:14] me off the lifellight, you ain't never
[44:16] seen so many doctors in your life
[44:17] saying, "Hey, Mr. Richmond, you're high
[44:19] priority here."
[44:22] Aort dissection is the main artery on on
[44:24] the bottom of my heart ruptured. And so
[44:27] the doctor explained it to me this way.
[44:28] It's like a twoly tire and uh that uh
[44:31] outer inner wall is your strongest wall
[44:34] and that inner wall ruptured on me and
[44:36] that outer wall and so all that pain I
[44:38] was going through was that rupture was
[44:41] all that blood swelling in my thing. And
[44:43] if you get to looking on uh it was a
[44:45] type B. So when I when they end up
[44:47] getting me in there, they're prepping me
[44:49] for open heart surgery is what they got
[44:50] me there for. And they end up going, he
[44:52] said, "We got to run another test on
[44:53] you, you know, and we got prayer
[44:55] warriors around the world praying for me
[44:56] at this point already." And uh you know
[44:58] I'm reading all this stuff and like 70
[45:00] 80% of the people he can tell you he
[45:02] he's in the medical field but 70 80%
[45:04] people die on the way to the hospital
[45:06] with what happened to me. And so I'm
[45:08] sitting in there and he's sitting there
[45:09] uh they they're telling me all this and
[45:11] that and give me this teddy bear that
[45:13] I'm going to have to hold and explaining
[45:14] all this stuff to me. And he winds up
[45:16] coming back and tells me he said there
[45:17] won't be no surgery. He he said it's it
[45:19] wound up being [music] a type B. And I
[45:21] said type B? He said yeah. He said it's
[45:23] more gastrial than than going into the
[45:25] front. And he goes on to commence to
[45:26] tell me awesome stuff. My dad and him
[45:28] were in there and he starts telling me
[45:30] that uh he asked me what I did for a
[45:32] living. I told him construction. He
[45:33] said, "You won't be able to do that
[45:35] anymore." He asked me what I do for fun.
[45:37] I said, "Lift weights and and hunt and
[45:38] stuff." He said, "You won't be able to
[45:40] do that anymore." He starts just
[45:41] literally stripping my life little by
[45:43] little. You know, he's taking away
[45:44] everything I do. You know, even my mind,
[45:47] I started going to thinking about like
[45:49] splitting firewood to burn wood in the
[45:50] winter time when it gets real cold. I
[45:52] burn a little wood. I started thinking I
[45:54] won't even be able to do this no more.
[45:55] He starts telling me I won't be able to
[45:56] lift but five pounds. This is what he's
[45:58] telling me. And I'm like I'm He's
[46:00] stripping my life. I said, 'Well, I
[46:02] said, 'Why don't we go in there and fix
[46:03] it? He said, uh uh the surgery on the
[46:05] type B is more complicated. The risk of
[46:07] me dying during surgery. Uh they they'll
[46:10] they'll keep me on aggressive medication
[46:11] the rest of my life. And so they won't
[46:13] go in there and fix it. And I'm like, so
[46:16] anyway, I start going into this dark
[46:18] spot, man. I just I I tell my this was
[46:20] the day before Thanksgiving uh four
[46:23] years ago. So, we're right now fixing to
[46:25] come up to Thanksgiving. That's how
[46:27] close we are. And I it's ironic where
[46:29] you're here. I got to where I was
[46:30] sharing every year. I called it a
[46:32] Thanksgiving testimony because I'm
[46:33] thankful to be alive. You know, I'm
[46:35] grateful to God. And uh and before it's
[46:38] all over, you know, I can tell you my
[46:40] greatest trial became my greatest
[46:41] blessing, you know, and and and and God
[46:44] was able to break that little leg, you
[46:46] know, like the little sheep that that
[46:47] shepherd, break that lamb's leg and uh
[46:49] and nurture it and take care of it. And
[46:51] you know, that's what he's done to me.
[46:53] And and you know, and that's why I just
[46:55] want to urge y'all to just, you know, if
[46:57] you're ever on the fence or have
[46:58] something, I just want to encourage you
[47:00] to sell out to Christ. [music] sell out
[47:02] whatever is hindering you and just give
[47:04] it all to Jesus Christ and break down to
[47:06] him and be talk to him like lip to ear
[47:09] like he's right there with you because
[47:10] he is and he's there to listen and hear
[47:13] you and just be real with him. If you're
[47:15] mad at him, tell him you're mad at him.
[47:16] If you're hurting, tell him you're
[47:18] hurting. Tell him your hurts. Tell him
[47:19] your pains
[47:21] &gt;&gt; and just be real with him and he'll be
[47:22] real with you. And uh and so uh you know
[47:27] I actually got to thinking I got in such
[47:29] a dark spot I thought well I might as
[47:31] well get out of here and like I said I'm
[47:32] just an energetic type person and I
[47:34] thought my life's over. I might as well
[47:36] get out of here and end this you know
[47:38] and like I said my my sister committed
[47:40] suicide and you know and [snorts] I'm
[47:42] thinking about all that that it's going
[47:43] to put my family through and I'm
[47:44] thinking about all the burden that I'm
[47:45] going to put my family through of having
[47:47] to take care of me because I can't do
[47:48] nothing anymore and and I'm like you
[47:50] know this is worse than cancer. I'm just
[47:52] going through, you know, I'm in this
[47:53] pity party right now. And I actually I I
[47:56] told my my wife, I don't want no more
[47:58] visitors. I didn't I wouldn't want
[47:59] nobody. And I laid there and I just
[48:01] stared at the wall, man. Just stared at
[48:04] the wall. And the TV was playing
[48:05] something. The the nurse would be like,
[48:06] "You mean cut it off? I don't care.
[48:09] Whatever you want to do, you know, I'm
[48:11] just miserable right now, man." And then
[48:13] I the one next day, whatever it was, I I
[48:15] told my wife. I was like and I was like
[48:17] I called my buddy, the one I told you
[48:19] that the church that I came to led me to
[48:22] the message, my buddy Joe, I called him
[48:24] up and I'm talking to him and he he's
[48:26] just like, "You got to look, man." He's
[48:28] like, "It's a miracle you didn't die on
[48:29] the way to the hospital." He said, "It's
[48:30] a miracle you didn't have to have
[48:32] surgery." And he said, "God's word says,
[48:34] "By my stripes, you're healed." And it
[48:35] was like Jesus coming there and turned
[48:37] the lights on for me. Quicken that
[48:39] scripture right then to me and it gave
[48:40] me hope. And at that point, I started
[48:43] believing. I'm like, you know, and and
[48:45] God started encouraging my spirit again
[48:46] where I was in that dark tunnel, man.
[48:48] And and I started I started claiming it,
[48:50] you know, and and then the nurses even
[48:52] told my dad, my dad, they was like,
[48:54] "Whatever you do, don't ever quit your
[48:56] medication." They they said, "You'll die
[48:57] if you quit your medication." Start
[48:58] telling me all this. This is They like,
[49:00] "You don't realize how serious this is."
[49:03] They had me like on 13 or 14
[49:04] medications, man. They had me on all
[49:06] this stuff and and uh you know and so I
[49:09] I come out professing my healing and
[49:11] believing in God, you know, and and I I
[49:14] pinned a piece of prayer call that
[49:15] brother Brandham actually put uh prayed
[49:17] over. I pinned it on me and wore me
[49:19] everywhere I went. I didn't care. I
[49:20] would tell him, you know, he's my
[49:22] healer. And then I finally got to a
[49:23] point that I believed if if I if he's
[49:25] going to heal me, he's already did it.
[49:28] And then then I could share that player
[49:29] call. I actually cut it in half and then
[49:31] shared it and I still got the other half
[49:32] in my wallet. And but uh uh because you
[49:36] know if I could believe that he's
[49:37] already did it, he's already did it. I
[49:39] don't have to wear that. But it
[49:40] encouraged my faith and inspired me, you
[49:42] know, [snorts] and I uh like I said too,
[49:45] that's where I said in here that you
[49:46] know and oh yeah and as I'm laying in a
[49:48] hospital bed about forgot this is how
[49:50] long have I been gone?
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Is that was that clock right?
[49:59] All right. Uh
[50:04] h. Yes. Let me get back on track. Where
[50:06] were we? [laughter]
[50:08] I'm like they're like, "Oh no, here we
[50:10] go. Here's this guy."
[50:15] &gt;&gt; I'm laying there in the hospital bed
[50:16] before I forget.
[50:18] There's many times before this. Uh I had
[50:22] I had had times where uh I had a buddy
[50:25] of mine that was taking this stuff from
[50:26] a gas station and the Lord to uh he
[50:28] actually I was like, "I I'll take this."
[50:30] And uh Lord told me not to. It's just
[50:33] that still small voice like don't do it.
[50:35] You know, I was like, it's just an
[50:37] energy shot. And I took it. Next thing I
[50:39] know, before I known it, it was almost
[50:41] like an addiction, but it was just this
[50:42] stuff you get at a gas station. You
[50:44] know, I minimized it. Next thing I know,
[50:46] now I know why the Holy Spirit told me
[50:48] not to do it because it kind of have
[50:49] addictive traits to it. Next thing I
[50:51] know, I'm taking it all the time. I
[50:52] don't know if it played a role in just
[50:54] disobedience or if it was just time for
[50:55] God to bring me. But anyway, there come
[50:57] a point there where God was like, "Just
[50:59] promise me you won't you [music] won't
[51:00] do it anymore." I was like, "I can't
[51:01] make any promises. I can't vow." He even
[51:03] done that with smoking cigarettes. There
[51:04] was times I'm like, you know, I couldn't
[51:06] I could never promise that I couldn't do
[51:07] it again when I would quit, you know,
[51:09] because I'm afraid what if I fail, you
[51:11] know, I don't want to make a vow and you
[51:12] not keep what I said I'm going to do.
[51:14] But I'm laid there in the hospital bed
[51:16] and I remember promising him, I'll
[51:18] promise you uh I won't be afraid to
[51:21] testify and I won't do anything you
[51:23] don't want me to do anymore. And I feel
[51:24] like looking back that was where I sold
[51:26] out and committed my life to Christ. And
[51:29] it was after that I got out of the
[51:31] hospital, God starts dealing with me,
[51:33] starts uh dealing with me on the
[51:34] sanctification process. And you know,
[51:37] and you know, I heard a story. It's kind
[51:38] of like a glass in a hog pin. You know,
[51:40] if I found this glass in the hog pin,
[51:43] you know, this glass is now it's
[51:44] justified,
[51:46] &gt;&gt; you know, this is my glass,
[51:48] &gt;&gt; you know, but it's dirty and poopy. I
[51:50] wouldn't drink out of this glass. Right.
[51:53] And and you you you start washing it up.
[51:55] He's got drugs out of his life. He's got
[51:57] alcohol out of his life. He's got the
[51:59] cigarettes out of his life. He's got it
[52:01] all the way out of his life. It's
[52:03] completely clean. He sets it aside for
[52:05] service.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; But it's waiting for the master to come
[52:08] fill it and put it in for service.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; And so then he was dealing with me on
[52:11] that sanctific and that's where I
[52:12] believe that's when I right around
[52:13] somewhere simultaneously. I couldn't
[52:15] tell you, but I received the Holy Ghost
[52:17] right around there. and he sent me in
[52:19] action to be able to go out and be sold
[52:20] out to him. And and uh
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Uh that's why, you know, that's why I
[52:25] just encourage you to sell out. You
[52:26] ain't got to go that far because, you
[52:28] know, once we get to a point where we
[52:29] see the baptism of the Holy Ghost, like
[52:31] the prophet taught us, is the new birth.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; I I could have went on for all them
[52:37] years not realizing this. All this time,
[52:40] I still never knew that till now. I look
[52:43] back and say when I when I accepted
[52:45] Jesus Christ that day way back when I
[52:46] told y'all when I was justified there, I
[52:49] was in such awe that I thought that I
[52:51] had got the new birth right there. You
[52:53] know, I thought I was born again then
[52:55] and I had just backslid. But, you know,
[52:57] like I heard it said too many times,
[52:58] people stop [music] at that
[52:59] justification stage,
[53:01] &gt;&gt; you know, and never go on further into
[53:03] the Holy Ghost land. And so, you know,
[53:05] God, that's where the Lord took me. He
[53:07] took me on to a deeper walk. Was
[53:09] predestinated to be filled with the Holy
[53:11] Ghost. And uh [music] and so uh uh you
[53:15] know, God God is uh he's so awesome, you
[53:18] know, and and you know, at this time in
[53:19] my life, you know, I I I before that's
[53:22] why I said it's easy to be half-hazardly
[53:24] going through the motions and get on
[53:25] YouTube or Instagram and scroll for
[53:27] three hours and go read your Bible and
[53:29] try to focus on the Lord for 30 minutes
[53:31] and say, "Oh, I'm going to give the Lord
[53:33] 30 minutes and I'm thinking about
[53:34] everything I looked at all the other
[53:35] three hours." You know, you don't really
[53:37] give him time. And I was like, you know,
[53:39] when I got out of there, I'm going to
[53:40] commit my commit more time to my Lord.
[53:42] And I got rid of the Instagram. I
[53:44] started playing my guitar a little bit.
[53:46] And I ain't no singer. And I can barely
[53:48] play the guitar, but I was doing it and
[53:50] just doing it. And God started dealing
[53:51] with me as being courageous, you know,
[53:54] like he told Joshua there, you know, uh,
[53:56] fear not, be thou courageous, be strong,
[53:59] be of good courage. God started dealing
[54:00] with me on just being courageous for the
[54:02] Lord. What good is it if somebody can
[54:04] get up here, this gifted singer that can
[54:06] s get up here and sing their heart out.
[54:08] Praise God for them gifts. Praise God
[54:09] for the for the singing. It it's
[54:11] beautiful. But what if you could get up
[54:13] here and you can't sing and you get up
[54:15] here and you try to pioneer the way for
[54:16] the children, for the kids to say, "Hey,
[54:18] look, he could do it. He wasn't that
[54:20] good." He did it though. Praise be to
[54:21] God. And so that's what God was leading
[54:23] me to do. That's why I said for fighting
[54:25] for the Lord. He He allowed me to do
[54:27] that and make a if we're going to be
[54:28] what he say. If we going to be
[54:29] somebody's fool, I want to be a fool for
[54:31] Christ, you know, so we can make oursel
[54:33] a fool for Christ, you know. And and so
[54:35] I got up there and I'm over the top. So,
[54:37] I sung an all original song I wrote. And
[54:39] then I sung Amazing Grace on top of it.
[54:42] Bless their hearts. They [laughter]
[54:44] they out there, boy, they going through
[54:45] it, son. They wanted some earplugs
[54:47] probably.
[54:48] But I'm like, Peter, you know, Zealous
[54:50] one going cut their ear off, you know,
[54:52] going be fired up. It's firing my bones,
[54:55] you know.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; But, uh, when I was in when I was in the
[54:58] hospital, uh, there was a doctor that
[55:00] came in there. He actually came in there
[55:02] on his like lunch break. He was sitting
[55:04] there. He was like he said, "Let me ask
[55:05] you something." He's like, he said, "Uh,
[55:07] you, uh, you ever been tested for your,
[55:09] uh, breathing this and that?" And I'm
[55:11] like, "No." He's like, he's like, "Uh,
[55:14] he he come in there." He's like, "So,
[55:15] you like elk hunting?" He started
[55:16] talking hunting with me and stuff. And
[55:17] he's like, he said he said, "Well, I'd
[55:19] like to encourage you." He said, he
[55:20] started telling me all these symptoms
[55:21] and stuff and I was like, "Yeah, man. I
[55:23] know I've been struggling." He's like,
[55:24] "Yeah, man." He said, "I'd go get
[55:26] checked for sleep apnnea, you know, and
[55:28] this and that." And I'm sitting at home
[55:30] and when I'm sitting there at my table
[55:31] and I was actually eating some soup and
[55:33] uh listening to a message or something
[55:35] and I just started thinking I'm like,
[55:37] man, I was having all these sleeping
[55:39] problems, man. And I'm like, you know,
[55:41] uh I guess I need to get checked out for
[55:43] sleep apnea. And and the Lord just
[55:46] ministered to my heart, "Will you
[55:47] believe the same God that heal you
[55:49] aortica heal you of sleep apnnea?" I do.
[55:51] And by God's grace, God healed me of
[55:53] sleep apnnea. and and and you know uh uh
[55:57] it just uh changed my sleep and he he
[55:59] gave me back my oxygen be to help me
[56:02] breathe man my my heart rate they'll
[56:04] tell you when I was on the way to the
[56:05] hospital my heart rate was 38 we was up
[56:07] in the mountains before that I had
[56:09] another whole testimony but my heart
[56:11] rate was like 38 and my oxygen levels
[56:13] were dropping down in like the low 80s
[56:16] maybe upper 70s I don't know something
[56:17] crazy and so that's why he was telling
[56:19] me all that and so for God to heal me
[56:21] and give me my rest back you know it was
[56:23] like God, what what he was doing was
[56:25] inspiring my faith. And you know, me and
[56:26] my me and my father-in-law was over here
[56:28] and uh uh we was working on a bush hog
[56:31] getting ready to get it hooked up and
[56:33] next thing I know the bush hog falls on
[56:34] my foot, crushes my foot in and it was
[56:36] all I look down all caved in and I'm I'm
[56:39] at this awkward angle and I tell my
[56:41] father-in-law, I'm like, "Go get a
[56:42] handyman jack." I'm yelling at him and
[56:43] then he he's doing something. I said,
[56:44] "Grab that board there." Now here he
[56:46] goes and grab here. He tweaks his back,
[56:48] you know, right? Then I'm like, "Oh no."
[56:50] I'm like, "Give me another board right
[56:51] there." And it was such an awkward angle
[56:53] I had to grab it like this. I couldn't
[56:55] get two hands on it. And I say it was
[56:56] just an angel. It was like a 4,000lb
[56:58] bush hog. Just enough that I got my foot
[57:00] out and fell over on the ground. And
[57:02] when I fell over on the ground, I looked
[57:03] down my boot. My boot was all caved in.
[57:05] I was like, "Oh my gosh." I I I thought
[57:08] it was just over. And then this peace
[57:10] came over me and I stood up and the Lord
[57:12] just gave me that scripture. Paul shook
[57:13] off that serpent. You know, no deadly
[57:16] thing going to harm us. So, I walked it
[57:18] off and I went over and prayed with my
[57:19] father and I went home and I looked
[57:21] down, my foot was all black and blue.
[57:22] I'm like, he didn't say he didn't leave
[57:24] no bite marks. [laughter]
[57:25] [snorts] And I'm like, you know what? I
[57:27] I I go back and I'm bush hoging and then
[57:29] the Lord just ministered to my heart,
[57:31] man, that I'm a very present help in a
[57:33] time of need.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; And he was encouraging my he was
[57:36] encouraging my walk because I was going
[57:37] to need these things. And as God started
[57:39] dealing with me and and started
[57:41] encouraging me and inspiring me, you
[57:43] know, I believe if my God is my healer,
[57:44] my deliverer, I'm going to be completely
[57:46] medication free, you know, and I had a
[57:49] buddy of mine that was going through it,
[57:50] you know, and he ends up telling me that
[57:52] uh and God was doing all these things
[57:54] like brother Ron, he called me out in a
[57:56] prayer line and, you know, just
[57:57] inspiring my faith to keep me pressing
[57:59] the mark, you know, and and uh and and
[58:02] uh you know, I had a buddy that he he
[58:03] ends up confessing to me that he'd been
[58:05] struggling with meth all these years and
[58:06] and this and that. And then I'm like,
[58:08] you know, I said, and I knew he needs a
[58:10] I know he needs a new birth experience.
[58:11] He needs a he needs an experience from
[58:13] the Lord. And I'm like, I said, well, I
[58:14] know what we can do. We can create an
[58:16] environment where the Lord feels welcome
[58:17] to come. I said, we can fast. We can
[58:19] pray just me and you and just we can
[58:22] have church where two or three are
[58:23] gathered in the midst he would be. And
[58:24] he was he agreed to it. And we we was
[58:26] setting up a time and the next thing you
[58:27] know he bails on me, you know, and and
[58:29] then uh uh uh we was coming down to it
[58:33] and the Lord started dealing with me and
[58:34] my wife and son were actually leaving at
[58:36] this time and it just wound up being
[58:37] perfect and the Lord said, "Well, what
[58:38] about me and you?" I said, "All right,
[58:39] let's go." You know, and so next thing I
[58:41] know, I quit my medication. I'm fasting.
[58:43] I'm praying. I'm I'm watching some I'm
[58:46] checking my blood pressure, you know.
[58:47] I'm checking my blood pressure just
[58:48] through the roof. I'm like, "Lord have
[58:49] mercy." You know, I'm like, you know, I
[58:51] got
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Sorry about that.
[59:02] Let me get a drink here. So, uh
[59:07] uh
[59:09] where was I just at?
[59:12] Uh
[59:15] oh. Yeah. I'm checking my blood pressure
[59:16] and I'm going through it like Lord have
[59:18] mercy. You know, it's through the roof,
[59:20] you know. And uh the Lord was just
[59:22] encouraged me. There was something I
[59:23] must do. Like Peter, he had to take that
[59:25] step out on the water. He had to take
[59:27] that step, you know. [music] And so God
[59:29] was encouraging me. And uh and I was
[59:31] checking it again. And the preacher I
[59:33] was listening to, it was actually Paul
[59:35] Leontaine. And he was saying he got to
[59:37] saying something. He said, uh uh he said
[59:39] uh there's no retreat in God's army.
[59:41] We're only pressing forward. And I think
[59:43] he was reading a quote off of [music]
[59:44] Brother Brandham. And I was like, that's
[59:45] right. You know, so it encouraged my
[59:47] spirit. And uh I keep on going. The next
[59:50] morning I woke up and I checked my blood
[59:52] pressure. I expected it was just going
[59:53] to be perfect. You know, the next day I
[59:54] checked it through the roof again. I'm
[59:56] like, "Oh my gosh." And that same piece
[59:58] I'm talking about came over me. And I
[1:00:00] was like, "Far as I'm concerned, you're
[1:00:01] lying to me." And I went in there and
[1:00:03] put it in the cabinet and I said I said,
[1:00:05] "The uh the Lord said, "I'm the Lord thy
[1:00:07] God that heals all thy diseases, and by
[1:00:09] my stripes you are healed." And I heard
[1:00:11] that same spirit speak to me. It said,
[1:00:12] "It's not every day you can risk dying
[1:00:14] by taking me at my word, but man shall
[1:00:16] not live by bread alone, but every word
[1:00:17] that proceeded out of mouth of God." And
[1:00:19] I realized at that point I was living,
[1:00:21] breathing, walking, talking by God's
[1:00:22] word. And so, you know, that's why I
[1:00:24] know the manifestation of his word in my
[1:00:26] life that he's a healer. He's a
[1:00:28] deliverer. He's a savior. He He's He's a
[1:00:31] restorer of all things. He'll fill you
[1:00:33] with the Holy Ghost. He'll do exactly
[1:00:35] what he said he would do. And his word
[1:00:37] won't return void unto him. Whatever you
[1:00:40] have need of, just draw on him.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; And so, so, so that's why I'm here just
[1:00:44] to testify and witness of the
[1:00:46] resurrection power. That's what I'm
[1:00:48] telling you here tonight. [snorts] And
[1:00:49] so uh uh as God uh started dealing with
[1:00:53] me, you know, and uh I actually went up
[1:00:56] the next day and went up there. Brad
[1:00:57] could testify on that and he'll tell you
[1:00:59] probably tomorrow. But when [music] I
[1:01:01] went up and got to pray for I don't know
[1:01:02] if you ever remember too. Do you
[1:01:03] remember me like stinking?
[1:01:06] Oh man, I don't know if anybody knowed
[1:01:08] that, but I ain't never said that. But
[1:01:10] man, I remember just stinking because I
[1:01:11] guess the medications coming out of my
[1:01:13] body and and I was like that's almost
[1:01:16] like death, ain't it? like, [laughter]
[1:01:17] "Dude, what in the world?" And uh he he
[1:01:19] ends up telling me later on that he was
[1:01:21] like, "Lord," he was like, "Don't do
[1:01:22] it." You know, he didn't want me to quit
[1:01:23] my medication. [snorts] But uh so I'm up
[1:01:27] there and uh uh I go I'm up in the
[1:01:30] mountains. Oh yeah. And so by God's
[1:01:32] grace, at this point uh I'm over three
[1:01:36] years medication free. I've outlifted
[1:01:38] all the records I have. They told me I
[1:01:40] wouldn't be doing no elk hunting, no
[1:01:41] nothing. I've went solo two years in a
[1:01:43] row, solo to Colorado, elk hunting up in
[1:01:46] the mountains. And uh you know, God, he
[1:01:49] came and visited me last year. I was up
[1:01:50] there in the mountains and and [music] I
[1:01:52] was up there and I can't explain it to
[1:01:54] you. I'll do the best I can though
[1:01:57] [laughter]
[1:01:58] here. But I was up there in the
[1:01:59] mountains and I heard this loud pow. And
[1:02:02] it was so loud I cannot explain it. It
[1:02:05] was right here. And I mean, I was like
[1:02:08] in shock and just looking around and it
[1:02:10] was just stillness. There was nothing.
[1:02:11] It was the loudest sound. And I'm just
[1:02:13] sitting there like in awe. And I'm
[1:02:15] [music] thinking uh I just thought I
[1:02:18] told Tammy later on I said must have
[1:02:20] been angels fighting or something right
[1:02:21] there. It was the loudest pow I'd ever
[1:02:23] heard in my life.
[1:02:25] And and and [music] then so the next day
[1:02:28] or something, I'm going up the mountains
[1:02:29] and I began to just cry out to God. I'm
[1:02:32] crying and I'm getting a little ahead of
[1:02:34] myself and rushing to my story. But you
[1:02:36] know, when I say the very present help
[1:02:37] in a time of need, after I quit my
[1:02:39] medication, me and a buddy of mine, we
[1:02:41] was working. We was we was doing this
[1:02:42] airplane hanger door down here hanging
[1:02:44] this big steel. We're up on these big
[1:02:46] lifts and I'm lifting stuff when I ain't
[1:02:48] supposed to be doing all this. I'm doing
[1:02:49] all this stuff and just pushing the
[1:02:50] limits because I believed my Lord, my
[1:02:52] God's my healer. And I would tell the
[1:02:54] devil, you know, I would just basically
[1:02:56] live my life. I I lifted my weights. I
[1:02:58] did everything that they just like I was
[1:03:00] if I wasn't healed. And so I kept on
[1:03:02] pressing that and I'm over here working
[1:03:04] and I I ain't gonna lie to you. I I when
[1:03:06] we got down, I never showed a thing to
[1:03:08] my buddy. I'm sitting here in cold
[1:03:09] sweats. I thought I was going to die.
[1:03:11] And I I'm coming down and I'm going to
[1:03:14] the bathroom and I I just feel like I'm
[1:03:15] going to die. And I get in there and
[1:03:16] just leaning on the wall just cold
[1:03:18] sweating. And I just say, "Lord, you
[1:03:19] said you're a very present help in a
[1:03:21] time of need." And he gave me comfort,
[1:03:23] strengthened my body. I went on about
[1:03:25] the rest of that day just as normal as
[1:03:27] could be. But he was elevating my faith
[1:03:29] through that time. And you know, that's
[1:03:31] why I'm here to tell you that he's a
[1:03:32] very present help in a time of need. And
[1:03:34] man shall not live by bread alone, but
[1:03:36] every word proceed out of mouth of God.
[1:03:37] And whatever word you have need of, it's
[1:03:39] in there. It is written. It is written.
[1:03:42] And so uh and so God was dealing with me
[1:03:44] up in the mountains because, you know, I
[1:03:46] I began to cry and brother brother uh uh
[1:03:49] Daryl Ward one time said, "When when God
[1:03:51] squeezes on a man's heart, uh uh his
[1:03:54] eyes are leak." and and I'm going up the
[1:03:56] mountain and I I began to just cry out
[1:03:58] to God and I'm crying and and [snorts] I
[1:04:00] I I'm crying and at this point the
[1:04:02] reason why I'm crying, y'all don't know
[1:04:03] how many times because I battled all
[1:04:06] that year and stuff when I when I'm
[1:04:07] testifying and believing for my healing.
[1:04:09] There would be days I couldn't go to
[1:04:11] work. I would just lay in the floor. I
[1:04:12] didn't even want my wife to know. I
[1:04:14] would lay in the floor and hide all the
[1:04:16] pain that I was going through and how I
[1:04:18] mean I literally felt like I can't do
[1:04:19] nothing today. I'm just going to die.
[1:04:21] And so I would just go through it. But,
[1:04:23] and you know, I would never say anything
[1:04:24] negative. I was never letting my
[1:04:26] testimony be negative. And so, here I am
[1:04:28] up in the mountains and I'm just going
[1:04:29] through it like used to. I could run
[1:04:31] these mountains and run these roads and
[1:04:32] I could go and out run them. I'll be the
[1:04:34] last man getting it. And and now here I
[1:04:37] am. I'm I'm walking doing things and
[1:04:39] just gassing like, and this is where I'm
[1:04:41] crying out to God like, Lord, I don't
[1:04:43] feel like I'm healed. I have not felt
[1:04:45] like I've been healed, but your word
[1:04:47] says it. And I'm crying out to God. And
[1:04:49] I'm crying out to God. and and and I
[1:04:51] come home that night and I'm sitting up
[1:04:53] there and I had some downloaded things
[1:04:55] in my offline thing of brother Brandham
[1:04:57] and I'm sitting there and I'm listening
[1:04:58] to uh uh I for forgot which one it was
[1:05:03] now but uh faith is a substance and I'm
[1:05:07] listening to that and I'm eating my food
[1:05:09] and stuff and I'm and you know how the
[1:05:11] words come on there on some of them
[1:05:12] YouTube movies uh that just brother
[1:05:14] Brandham's words but I'm reading it and
[1:05:16] I'm listening to him and it's like I'm
[1:05:18] watching a movie I'm into this and He
[1:05:20] starts telling the John Ryan story and
[1:05:22] telling uh some of the different ones
[1:05:24] and this woman was like she was like she
[1:05:26] didn't realize like days later she got
[1:05:27] her healing went back looking for the
[1:05:29] whatever it was that fell off of her or
[1:05:31] something, you know. Anyway, so I'm
[1:05:33] going up the mountain the next day and
[1:05:34] I'm going up the mountain and and uh
[1:05:37] Lord just told me to uh start writing
[1:05:39] like I take little notes on my phone,
[1:05:40] write the types that I was and I say and
[1:05:42] why I was like, "Yeah, you know, you
[1:05:44] type it out." And so I started typing
[1:05:46] out. He's like I'm like Peter. I had to
[1:05:47] take that first step, you know. I was a
[1:05:49] I was the woman with a blood issue, you
[1:05:52] know. Uh I just started, you know,
[1:05:53] naming them Legion, you know, I was
[1:05:55] naming all these ones. And then I
[1:05:57] remember saying uh like Jacob wrestle I
[1:06:00] was
[1:06:01] and then I said I was like well well
[1:06:03] Lord how could I wrestle you for my
[1:06:05] blessing? Then I start but but I'm over
[1:06:07] here wanting to get my bull that I had
[1:06:09] an opportunity had the first day and I
[1:06:11] blew my opportunity to get my bull up
[1:06:13] and I I'm like what can I do to get my
[1:06:16] blessing Lord? And uh so anyway,
[1:06:18] needless to say, uh I'm writing that
[1:06:20] down. And so the next day, I just
[1:06:23] paraphrase. You know, time goes on. It's
[1:06:25] hard to get all the details. I'm sure I
[1:06:26] don't have to give y'all every detail,
[1:06:28] but I'm really good at the story time,
[1:06:29] Tommy. But uh so uh as uh I'm going up
[1:06:33] today, this day, the spirit of the Lord
[1:06:35] just hits me, man. I'm coming up. It's
[1:06:36] dark in the morning. I I just fall down
[1:06:38] on my knees and I start crying. I pull
[1:06:41] my gloves. I pull my hat off. And I'm
[1:06:42] just just crying, basking in his
[1:06:44] presence right there. And he told me,
[1:06:46] "I've been wrestling for my blessing
[1:06:48] these last three years at that time."
[1:06:50] And that loud pow and I had noticed then
[1:06:52] he takes me back that loud pow that I
[1:06:54] heard you know and then I noticed that I
[1:06:57] had run that mountains the next day like
[1:06:59] felt I was like man I was feeling good
[1:07:00] again and and putting two and two
[1:07:02] together. God had just come up there and
[1:07:04] gave me a special visitation and [music]
[1:07:06] touched me, you know, and by God's
[1:07:08] grace, he completed it. And now I'm a
[1:07:10] modern day, a modern type of John Ryan,
[1:07:13] you know, and so now I'm a witness of
[1:07:15] all them years, even though I didn't
[1:07:17] feel it. Didn't ask you if you felt it.
[1:07:20] Do you believe it?
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; So you believe it. And in spite of
[1:07:22] everything, you keep believing and keep
[1:07:24] pressing. Never let your testimony be
[1:07:26] negative. Footsteps means possession.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; You know, and it it's our land. It's
[1:07:31] given to us. Faith is the substance of
[1:07:33] things hoped for, you know. And he set
[1:07:35] me out to be a billboard for the Lord
[1:07:37] Jesus Christ. He put Jesus in action in
[1:07:39] me, you know. He don't want just a
[1:07:41] stuffed shirt, you know. He wants alpha,
[1:07:43] I mean, become an omega, you know, in
[1:07:45] us. Jesus Christ said that signs and
[1:07:47] wonders will follow the believers. Glory
[1:07:49] to God. You know, my brother-in-law,
[1:07:51] he's going to share a little testimony
[1:07:52] here shortly of of his healing. And uh
[1:07:55] you know uh it it wasn't if it wasn't
[1:07:57] for this message this you know sitting
[1:08:00] under this message this vindicated word
[1:08:02] for our day my faith wouldn't be where
[1:08:04] it's at.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; You know hearing this kind of preaching
[1:08:08] you know hearing hearing things like
[1:08:10] that that simple John Ryan story. He had
[1:08:12] his healing all along. He's he kept
[1:08:14] coming to the prayer line go you had it.
[1:08:17] You know what? Who? Somebody brought it
[1:08:19] out that he that brother Brandham said
[1:08:21] that uh he had basically told him the
[1:08:23] man later on that uh you're almost like
[1:08:26] tempting the Lord. You know what I'm
[1:08:28] saying there?
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; You remember what it was?
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Well, there was one where he said uh he
[1:08:35] was almost uh making the Lord frustrated
[1:08:38] because he came again. He said, "You go
[1:08:40] on." He and that's when brother Brandham
[1:08:42] gave him something to do. I was like,
[1:08:44] "Wow." you know, because it was a
[1:08:45] simplicity of, you know, taking him at
[1:08:48] his word. But anyway,
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; uh uh you know, it's such a privilege
[1:08:53] and honor to dine around the master's
[1:08:55] table. Now,
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; we're dining around the truth for our
[1:08:58] day. This food, man. I mean, what you're
[1:09:01] hearing though, this faith expressed,
[1:09:03] man, in reality, it's just right now I I
[1:09:06] am preaching the Bible to you through
[1:09:08] action, through my life.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; I know it's been long and drug out. I'm
[1:09:12] sorry about that. You know, I I got a a
[1:09:14] little dream I had just a little bit
[1:09:15] ago. It was a buddy of mine. And I'll
[1:09:18] tell you, uh my buddy, me and him's been
[1:09:21] through everything together. And so, in
[1:09:23] this dream, just just, it's hard for me
[1:09:25] to tell this story how how it goes or I
[1:09:27] end up mixing it up and getting the cart
[1:09:28] before the horse on this one. But in my
[1:09:30] dream there, here's my buddy. He's on
[1:09:32] and right before I had this dream before
[1:09:34] I was going down here going bear hunting
[1:09:35] this year. He was uh he just had a a
[1:09:38] motorcycle wreck and and broke his
[1:09:40] collar bone. and I felt like going to
[1:09:42] see him. And uh it was a little while
[1:09:46] back that he said uh that's why I'm how
[1:09:49] to go into that. Uh a little while back
[1:09:52] that he said I'm in a cult following a
[1:09:53] false prophet and all this and that, you
[1:09:55] know, and we'll go down through there
[1:09:56] and and and I've always wanted to
[1:09:58] minister to him again and and just try
[1:10:00] to share more with him and uh I was
[1:10:03] like, well, you know, maybe I could just
[1:10:05] go be a friend to him. And and it didn't
[1:10:07] open up for me to go pray with him. And
[1:10:10] then so then I have this dream and in my
[1:10:12] dream my buddy he's sitting there on the
[1:10:14] sidewalk. He always dressed he always
[1:10:16] dressed to the tea. So you know he
[1:10:17] dressed real nice. He he was on the
[1:10:19] sidewalk and and he was sitting there
[1:10:21] and he was like I heard this voice of
[1:10:23] him saying it was like oh they came up
[1:10:24] from behind me hit me in the head and
[1:10:26] he's he's saying all this. It was like
[1:10:27] he was trying to play on their emotions
[1:10:29] of like trying to get sympathy like and
[1:10:31] and he's sitting there and it's like his
[1:10:33] voice playing in the background was like
[1:10:34] some background music actually had some
[1:10:36] background music to it. It was it was
[1:10:38] kind of weird. And I'm with Tammy and
[1:10:40] this is where I was like, you know, I
[1:10:41] want I want to go talk to him. And I
[1:10:43] drove around again. And it kind of
[1:10:44] reminded me of wanting to go talk to him
[1:10:45] the other day, but couldn't go talk to
[1:10:47] him, right?
[1:10:49] And there he is. And I go down there and
[1:10:51] I go down there and talk talk to him.
[1:10:53] I'm talking to him and and and
[1:10:56] next thing I know, we're saying
[1:10:57] something. I can't remember everything,
[1:10:58] but the next thing I know, I grab him by
[1:11:00] the face and I say, "Frank," I said,
[1:11:02] "Just just repent and believe the
[1:11:04] message."
[1:11:06] And uh next thing I know his eye went
[1:11:08] all demonic and crazy looking. And then
[1:11:11] it's like I stepped back and and then
[1:11:13] next thing I know he's he had this
[1:11:15] fearful look in his face. He's like,
[1:11:16] "I'm falling." He's sitting there just
[1:11:17] flailing on the ground falling. He he
[1:11:20] said, "I'm falling." And I I woke up,
[1:11:22] man. Later on, I was just like, "Man,
[1:11:24] that was one of them just real dreams,
[1:11:25] right? It was so real." And and and I
[1:11:28] tell you that because my buddy here that
[1:11:30] I'm telling you about, we've been
[1:11:31] through drugs, women, partying. We some
[1:11:34] one of my oldest friends, we've been
[1:11:35] through everything. I was up there and
[1:11:37] we got in a fight one night. Me and a
[1:11:39] bunch of them up there got in a fight.
[1:11:40] His he ends up pulling a gun on me. I
[1:11:42] end up running at him with the gun. He
[1:11:44] runs back in the house. I wound up
[1:11:46] everything hit the fan out there and
[1:11:47] then I got on my motorcycle and I'm
[1:11:49] going down the end of the driveway and I
[1:11:50] hear
[1:11:53] hear two bullets fly by my head. Wound
[1:11:55] up going on and then another time after
[1:11:57] that wound up being up there getting in
[1:11:58] another big fight and the law gets
[1:12:00] caught on me. I get a DUI right in his
[1:12:02] driveway.
[1:12:04] Later on down in life, time goes on
[1:12:06] after all this stuff and he gets out of
[1:12:08] jail, too. And I I'm his uh sponsor,
[1:12:12] like AA and NA sponsor and and uh uh
[1:12:16] trying to be there for him, support him.
[1:12:18] Then he goes to Bible school and this
[1:12:20] and that, and goes into the se uh
[1:12:22] cemetery, you know, [laughter]
[1:12:25] because he was actually believing a
[1:12:26] little bit of what I had to say about uh
[1:12:28] serpent seed and stuff. Then he goes,
[1:12:29] "Nope." And he starts going the other
[1:12:31] way. Then we had some Bible studies, me
[1:12:32] and my brother-in-law here. We had Bible
[1:12:34] studies and we're doing these things and
[1:12:36] you know, and then God starts, this is
[1:12:38] where I'm telling you all that to say
[1:12:39] that all that we went through, we we
[1:12:42] always used to say me and him was like
[1:12:43] old married couple. We done been through
[1:12:45] everything and made it, you know, and
[1:12:47] now you know what caused the separation.
[1:12:50] Revela after this dream, the Lord showed
[1:12:52] me revelation caused the separation.
[1:12:55] Look at Cain and Cain and Abel. What
[1:12:58] caused the separation?
[1:13:00] Yes sir.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; And so what the message can uh justify
[1:13:04] you or condemn you. This message binds
[1:13:07] us together in Jesus Christ.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; And then he and then it was like the
[1:13:11] Lord just ministering to my heart that
[1:13:12] you know Judas was always a seat of seat
[1:13:16] of this predition. He was always seated
[1:13:19] of the devil. You know I don't I hope
[1:13:22] that's not my birdie. You know but but
[1:13:24] God was quickening me. The revelation
[1:13:27] revelation gives you stimulation. Huh?
[1:13:29] But the revelation of this message of
[1:13:31] the hour, you know, to me is just so
[1:13:34] awesome when we when we start seeing,
[1:13:36] like I said, when we start seeing who we
[1:13:37] are because we know who he is. Glory to
[1:13:39] God. We know who we're going because
[1:13:42] where we came from, you know, back to
[1:13:43] the future is where I took you today.
[1:13:45] Walking in the vision with the Lord
[1:13:46] Jesus Christ. Glory to God. You know,
[1:13:49] and as God, you know, and we got this
[1:13:51] great commission that we must live in
[1:13:52] our lives, you know, brother Madam said,
[1:13:54] uh, uh, he couldn't heal no one. It was
[1:13:56] their faith. So we want to inspire your
[1:13:59] faith tonight. You know, and I was like
[1:14:00] thinking about this in Joshua here, you
[1:14:03] know, he says, "And as soon as we had
[1:14:04] heard these things, uh, our hearts did
[1:14:07] melt. Neither did there remain any
[1:14:10] courage in any man because of you. For
[1:14:13] the Lord your God, he is the God of
[1:14:15] heaven." And on down he said, "Give me a
[1:14:17] true token." You know, and and it it got
[1:14:20] me just all fired up thinking about
[1:14:21] this. You know, our enemies, these dumb
[1:14:22] devils, every one of them, you know,
[1:14:24] that should be cast down the pits of
[1:14:26] hell, go back to the hell where they
[1:14:27] belong. We should make their hearts melt
[1:14:30] within them. Have no more courage when
[1:14:33] we get out of bed and start praying and
[1:14:34] be some real Christians, be some real
[1:14:36] prayer warriors while we're praying on
[1:14:38] our prayer bones, praying for our
[1:14:40] brothers and sisters in Christ for Jesus
[1:14:42] around the world. They know we mean
[1:14:44] business when we get down on our knees
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; because we're a bloodbought son of God
[1:14:48] and we know who we are. And when we know
[1:14:50] who we are, we have a checkbook. It's
[1:14:52] got his name on it. We have no power,
[1:14:54] but we have the authority through Jesus
[1:14:56] Christ to do exactly what he did. So I
[1:14:59] believe when God spoke, "Let there be
[1:15:00] light." There was light. When we get
[1:15:02] down on our prayer bones, I believe that
[1:15:04] there will be action following it
[1:15:06] because we are believers.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; We don't pray just to be playing church.
[1:15:10] We ain't just playing church and going
[1:15:11] through the motions. I believe we are
[1:15:13] John 14 church in action. You know, he
[1:15:15] he that John 14:21, he that comm he that
[1:15:18] he that hath my commandments, he keepeth
[1:15:20] them. He is that loveth me, and he that
[1:15:23] loveth me shall be loved of my father,
[1:15:26] and I will love him, and I will manifest
[1:15:29] myself to him. I love that. That was so
[1:15:32] rich. I want to show y'all when he's
[1:15:34] manifesting himself to you because he
[1:15:36] loves you. You're his sweet little
[1:15:37] darling. You're his sweetheart. you
[1:15:39] know, we're the eleaser uh now ushering
[1:15:42] in more faith to you that he's just like
[1:15:44] brother Brandham has taught us all these
[1:15:46] love secrets. Now we're the
[1:15:48] manifestation of the maturing of those
[1:15:50] love secrets. Now we're the bride of
[1:15:52] Christ in action. And he says here, he
[1:15:55] said uh Jesus answered and said unto
[1:15:57] him, if a man love me, he will keep my
[1:15:59] words and my father will love him and
[1:16:02] will come unto him and make our uh do
[1:16:05] with him. So he going to tabernacle our
[1:16:08] hearts. And to me that is so awesome.
[1:16:10] You know Jesus wants to make you a
[1:16:11] billboard. He don't need salesmen out
[1:16:13] here sales pitching. [music] He needs
[1:16:15] you to be a billboard like Jesus Christ
[1:16:17] was hung high up on that cross and by
[1:16:19] his stripes we were healed. He was
[1:16:21] wounded for our transgressions. That's
[1:16:23] right.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; You know and who Christ says free is
[1:16:26] free indeed.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; And I'm a witness because when you get
[1:16:30] free in the spirit that's where it takes
[1:16:32] that you know you know like I was just
[1:16:34] witnessing to a guy in a prison the
[1:16:35] other day. He's got he's been in there
[1:16:37] 20 years and and got life without. And
[1:16:39] you know, he can be free right now,
[1:16:41] though.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; You don't have to go out there. You can
[1:16:44] be more free in Christ Jesus in here,
[1:16:46] just like any one of us or anybody out
[1:16:48] there.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; You know, and God, you know, like I
[1:16:51] said, you know, I told you, you know, on
[1:16:53] or told y'all a while ago, my message is
[1:16:55] my story. My story is my message. I'm
[1:16:57] living the manifestation of it. Brother
[1:16:58] Brandham said in spiritual food in due
[1:17:00] season, the messenger, the message and
[1:17:03] the word was exactly the same thing. The
[1:17:06] prophet, the word, the message, the
[1:17:07] messenger, the message and the message
[1:17:09] was the same. Jesus said, "If I do not
[1:17:12] the works that's written of me, then
[1:17:14] don't believe me." That is good. Any man
[1:17:16] and his message is one. That's why my
[1:17:19] message is Jesus Christ. I'm nothing
[1:17:21] without him, but I can do all things
[1:17:23] through him.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And he said, "And uh but
[1:17:27] those who believe God's hour that we're
[1:17:30] living in, these things are hidden food
[1:17:32] for him." Just think of it. God has so
[1:17:34] hid them that they look right at it and
[1:17:36] don't see it. The same way Elijah
[1:17:39] blinded the Syrian army. The same way
[1:17:42] that God blinds the unbeliever and the
[1:17:44] true genuine food from the true genuine
[1:17:48] food of the child to the believer. you
[1:17:51] know, man, you know, no matter what your
[1:17:54] mess might be, God can turn your mess
[1:17:55] into a message, you know, because he is
[1:17:57] the same yesterday, today, and forever,
[1:17:59] you know, and uh, you know, so I'll ask
[1:18:02] you today, what legacy will you leave
[1:18:04] behind?
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "What are you
[1:18:08] fight? What are you living for? What do
[1:18:10] you work for? What are you eating for?
[1:18:12] What are you struggling for to live?
[1:18:15] What are you living for? To die?
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Are you not fit to live unless you're
[1:18:19] fit to die? Amen.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; So he's the king of kings and you know
[1:18:23] one of the stories I love and you know
[1:18:25] I'll just paraphrase it the king the
[1:18:27] king story he says you know they they
[1:18:29] came up through there asking him you
[1:18:31] know I want I want a cow another one
[1:18:33] come up here I want a horse you know I
[1:18:36] want this I want that granted granted
[1:18:38] another guy came up there like I said
[1:18:40] I'm just going to paraphrase it I don't
[1:18:41] know the exact ones but he said I want
[1:18:43] like a 100,000 acres granted I want
[1:18:46] bunch of gold granite I want bunch of
[1:18:48] cattle granite bunch of horses granite
[1:18:50] And you just name it. Granite. Granite.
[1:18:53] Granite. Goes on. The guard comes over
[1:18:56] and ask him. He's like, "Do you know
[1:18:58] what you just did?" He said, "Yeah." But
[1:19:00] he's the only one that come through that
[1:19:01] ask what a king could give. So I tell
[1:19:04] you today, no matter how big, don't be
[1:19:07] afraid to ask what a big God can give.
[1:19:09] He can give anything that you have need
[1:19:11] of. It's in Christ Jesus.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts]
[1:19:14] And you know, I just I just I just
[1:19:17] encourage you, you know, tonight that
[1:19:19] you're going to be somebody's billboard.
[1:19:20] You're going to be a billboard for the
[1:19:22] devil or billboard for God.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; So I pray, oh God, you Oh God, oh Lord
[1:19:27] Jesus, that you put the Lord God on
[1:19:28] display
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; and display Christ Jesus in your life.
[1:19:32] Be a written epistle read to all men, to
[1:19:34] everyone [music] that you have. And and
[1:19:36] and just just just fall in love with
[1:19:38] Jesus more and more. And you know like a
[1:19:41] buddy minister of mine told me and
[1:19:43] that's what one thing it just kind of
[1:19:45] started sparking more in me is he said
[1:19:47] uh he said when God was calling him to
[1:19:49] be a minister he said it you know he
[1:19:51] grew up in the message and this and that
[1:19:52] and he said but he told the Lord if
[1:19:54] you're calling me I want to be something
[1:19:56] real and you know that stuck with me you
[1:19:59] know and that's where I want to be just
[1:20:00] something real
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; just something a real life change a real
[1:20:04] life lived
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; making the word come alive and and just
[1:20:08] growing deeper in Christ and and may God
[1:20:11] bless you. I pray that that that it's a
[1:20:13] blessing to you. And if you have any
[1:20:15] need of any prayer tonight before you
[1:20:17] leave, we'll pray with you because signs
[1:20:19] and wonders follow the believer. Mark 16
[1:20:22] said we would lay hands on the sick and
[1:20:23] they shall recover and we should cast
[1:20:26] out devils in his name and we could do
[1:20:28] all things through Christ Jesus.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; And it's there if you would ask what a
[1:20:32] king could give.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; You know, and whatever y'all want to do
[1:20:35] after this, we can keep on we can keep
[1:20:37] on going. We come eight hours to have a
[1:20:38] good time in the Lord Jesus. We come up
[1:20:40] here to entertain Jesus Christ and
[1:20:42] praise [applause] his wonderful name.
[1:20:44] He's worthy of all of our praise.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; And so,
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Appreciate you.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Sing some songs. You want You want to
[1:20:57] share Troy? Do you want him to share
[1:21:00] tonight or
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; I went a little bit quicker, didn't I?
[1:21:04] Is that clock right? That ain't right.
[1:21:07] Yeah,
