[0:00] we've been here and uh we're glad that

[0:04] I I do count it a a grand privilege to
[0:08] worship uh the Lord with you and uh we
[0:11] definitely are very eager uh always get
[0:14] eager when I come here I get excited and
[0:17] uh might be even a little bit excitable
[0:20] but uh anyway um you know I think the
[0:23] the spirit of God gives us Liberty to do
[0:25] those things doesn't it amen uh I'm very
[0:28] excited I feel like I could talk uh
[0:31] uh just even even a moment it looks like
[0:34] things are beginning to wrap up I'm so
[0:35] excited uh I I haven't uh brother Jesse
[0:39] is amazing with his schedule I'm not
[0:41] quite as well with that but uh I did see
[0:43] he was preaching on the coming of the
[0:44] Lord I haven't had much of a time to
[0:46] hear about that but uh I'm so glad that
[0:48] we are living very close to the coming
[0:50] of the Lord amen how many believe that
[0:52] uh you know the Holy Spirit should put
[0:53] that uh uh she put that hunger that that
[0:56] thirst in our hearts like tomorrow hey
[0:58] today could be the last day tomorrow
[0:59] could be last day you see a man is
[1:01] always trying to look for something

[1:06] that by the holy spirit inside of us oh

[1:31] pastor for two years of my life I
[1:32] thought that was a grand thrill and um
[1:36] you know by God's grace I really can't
[1:38] say more about what the Lord produces in
[1:40] his life uh in the Saints here that are
[1:43] influenced by him as well as your
[1:44] influencing to him uh it really does
[1:47] bring forth uh a move of God Amen if we

[5:24] into the message this morning if you'd
[5:26] like to stand for the reading of the
[5:27] word
[5:30] see some brothers and sisters I haven't
[5:32] met before God bless you good to see
[5:34] brother Jose brother Austin Selena I
[5:37] just go right down
[5:39] around just keep going keep going keep
[5:41] going uh but uh by God's
[5:45] grace uh we're happy to be
[5:48] here just going to preach a little
[5:50] thought this
[5:52] morning got a few things on my heart and
[5:55] uh you know we'll see what the Lord will
[5:56] do with this hopefully I'm going to use
[5:58] your your pastor's last song is the the
[6:00] confirmation I I always just stand there
[6:02] with about two or three sermons and I
[6:04] say Lord which way and uh I am hooked up
[6:08] if this can get started we are going to
[6:11] go to Hebrews 7 and after that we're
[6:13] going to go to uh First Timothy
[6:19] 2 okay let's see all right Hallelujah
[6:24] very simple sermon but uh if I can I'd
[6:26] just like to uh uh maybe awaken our
[6:29] senses uh to where we're at what we're
[6:32] living in and uh very I believe these
[6:36] these things uh actually this right here
[6:39] uh really changed uh my understanding uh
[6:42] of the message as far as uh how much
[6:45] more personal it really is to me and uh
[6:48] I think that's very uh important for all
[6:50] of us is actually to understand uh the
[6:54] Simplicity of what is going on with
[6:56] where we're at amen uh I I've preached a
[7:00] lot of things and and uh yet this right
[7:02] here just really sticks out to me uh
[7:04] it's working with the blood of Jesus
[7:05] Christ and uh very simple but yet uh
[7:08] like I said I'd like to maybe give you a
[7:10] little bible tour if we can go through
[7:12] this uh Hebrews 7:22 it says by so much
[7:16] was Jesus made
[7:19] assurity of a better
[7:22] Testament and they truly were many
[7:25] priests because they were not suffered
[7:28] uh to continue continue by reason of
[7:31] death uh but this man because he
[7:34] continueth ever uh hath an
[7:37] unchangeable priesthood Hallelujah
[7:40] wherefore he is able also to save them
[7:45] to the
[7:46] uttermost that come unto God by him
[7:50] seeing he ever liveth to make
[7:54] intercession for them amen uh so if we
[7:59] knew that there's of course by the word
[8:02] of God here that he is able to save you
[8:05] to the uttermost yes you see God never
[8:09] made himself to be absent from the
[8:12] believer a Believer can make God absent
[8:16] but God wants to be ever present amen
[8:19] amen hallelujah we We Know by the Bible
[8:21] he's a peace that surpasses all
[8:23] understanding amen hallelujah that no
[8:26] matter what you're going through where
[8:29] you are or how bad it may seem God has a
[8:33] way he wants to reveal himself to you
[8:36] Hallelujah yes Hallelujah let's do one
[8:42] more 1 Timothy 2
[8:49] verse5 so glad this does away with uh it
[8:52] does away with a
[8:54] pope it does away with the headship of a
[8:56] denomination that's right it honestly it
[8:59] does away with a message
[9:02] Pope yes sir Hallelujah right there's
[9:06] really only one mediator isn't
[9:09] there see I'm not your mediator your
[9:11] pastor ain't your mediator your brother
[9:12] or sister ain't your your spouse is not
[9:14] your mediator Jesus Christ is your
[9:17] mediator let us come unto him amen 1
[9:21] Timothy 2 ver5 it says for there is one
[9:24] God and one mediator between God and Men
[9:28] uh the man Christ Jesus uh who gave
[9:32] himself a ransom for all to be
[9:37] testified in due time amen uh so Christ
[9:42] he became a ransom for you amen uh he
[9:45] became uh in a way that he would what
[9:49] pay the price for every failure not that
[9:53] was just done 2,000 years ago but until
[9:57] intercession was done with amen
[10:00] Hallelujah aren't you glad about that
[10:02] amen because you see that means that his
[10:04] blood will supply for your needs of
[10:07] yesterday Hallelujah his blood will
[10:09] supply for your need today and his blood
[10:11] will what it will go until you are
[10:13] raptured you are secure in Christ amen
[10:17] hallelujah uh let us bow our heads for a
[10:19] word of
[10:21] prayer Our most precious Lord Jesus
[10:24] Christ uh humbly we come before you Lord
[10:26] thanking you for this ministry that you
[10:28] started here Lord uh knowing oh God that
[10:31] there's uh there's another little flak
[10:33] out there Lord that uh loves you with
[10:34] their whole heart they're they're doing
[10:36] their best oh God to uh come under the
[10:38] headship of the word of God lord so
[10:40] we're just glorifying you for that oh
[10:43] God the move that you're doing and uh
[10:45] Lord as we approach this topic here Lord
[10:48] uh we're asking oh God that you just
[10:50] give us inspiration oh God I uh if I'm
[10:54] using this song Oh God as the
[10:55] confirmation but Lord I can go anywhere
[10:57] you want me to Lord I I trust oh God God
[10:59] that uh the gift that you've placed in
[11:01] me oh God will be able to uh I'll be
[11:04] able to submit to that oh God and to do
[11:06] and say everything that you would have
[11:07] me to say oh God uh thou knowest oh God
[11:10] our hearts before you where we've come
[11:12] here looking for something oh God uh
[11:14] we've come here to Worship You Lord uh
[11:16] and Lord now we come for the hearing of
[11:19] the word oh God knowing uh even oh God
[11:22] as we seen Vindicated from brother
[11:24] brandom oh God uh many times he didn't
[11:26] even know what he was saying as he was
[11:28] preaching oh God but Lord he would just
[11:30] get so yielded to your spirit oh God
[11:33] that you could take him any direction
[11:35] even to any depth uh even Beyond his
[11:39] understanding Lord so we're just asking
[11:41] oh God that that same God would be in
[11:43] our midst oh God we welcome you here
[11:45] Lord and we're believing oh God that
[11:47] Lord through great Mercy oh God uh
[11:49] you've given us the ability to be here
[11:50] today every single one of us Lord so
[11:52] with that Lord we're asking that you'd
[11:53] bring Revelation uh and understanding oh
[11:56] God that we'd be able to move forward in
[11:58] you Lord so we just give you all the
[11:59] glory honor and praise in the name of
[12:01] Jesus Christ the church says together
[12:03] amen you may be
[12:09] seated we're going to work with this
[12:11] idea today uh the power of heavenly
[12:15] applied blood okay uh the power of
[12:19] heavenly applied blood and uh we'll try
[12:22] to uh just sew this in there real rich
[12:26] and deep um how many know I I'm so glad
[12:29] you know our Prophet came out and he was
[12:31] telling us things and uh one of the
[12:33] things that always stuck out to me he
[12:34] said he said the Holy Ghost is actually
[12:36] more real in this room than you and I
[12:40] are Hallelujah well how could you say
[12:43] such a thing because uh this is actually
[12:46] a temporal expression this is not the
[12:48] real right uh we we're living in a in a
[12:51] fin finite form uh a fallen form uh from
[12:56] what God actually called us to be right
[12:58] but God did these things for a purpose
[13:00] because it was actually the mind of God
[13:03] uh so that he would allow you to be in a
[13:05] fallen state so you could see a
[13:07] Victorious State uh through him amen uh
[13:10] it was God's desire to fill you with the
[13:13] Holy Ghost right it was God's desire to
[13:15] put his own life amen the very dunamis
[13:19] of God his very Life Zoey inside of you
[13:23] amen uh his purpose in doing these
[13:26] things was what it was to prepare a
[13:29] church to become in His image for a
[13:32] Rapture amen uh with all this uh uh
[13:35] things going on with the election and
[13:37] everything everyone's breathing a breath
[13:38] of of uh of of relief or sigh a lot of
[13:42] us might be right and it's really not
[13:44] about politics because either way you
[13:46] see it um the plan is moving forward
[13:49] amen uh one thing I I know about
[13:51] Revelations 13 when it came to the Beast
[13:54] out of the earth it was the United
[13:56] States's job to bring for for the image
[13:59] to the Beast amen hallelujah my brother
[14:02] just sent me something last night uh
[14:04] where president Trump he's already
[14:06] saying he said we've got away from
[14:07] religion it's time we get back to
[14:09] religion right uh it's pushing
[14:12] everything back to what now remember the
[14:15] religion the unification they're trying
[14:17] to do it does not have you part of it
[14:20] amen why because you have been called in
[14:22] this hour to unite with the Living Word
[14:25] himself amen you've been called to what
[14:28] you go out and meet him Hallelujah you
[14:31] cry out you believe it amen you are
[14:34] don't wait to get oil then you pray up
[14:37] now amen and watch seek the Lord until
[14:40] he will be found of you amen hallelujah
[14:45] hallelujah so this morning I want to
[14:47] bring it this way
[14:49] because I want you to understand that
[14:52] there was a time where this wasn't a
[14:54] reality uh we're working with the power
[14:57] of the Heavenly blood applyed
[14:59] and uh I'm going to start in the Old
[15:01] Testament and begin just to build a
[15:03] foundation going a direction hopefully
[15:05] uh God will help us here cuz uh when
[15:07] this opened up to my mind I was like oh
[15:11] hallelujah hallelujah uh Exodus 25 verse
[15:15] 8 uh there was remember in the Old
[15:17] Testament uh the Tabernacle was given it
[15:20] was given as a pattern right uh in
[15:23] Exodus 258 it say let them make me a
[15:26] sanctuary uh that I may dwell among them
[15:29] it was God's desire to dwell among man
[15:35] amen hallelujah now remember here it is
[15:38] in a law form he wants to dwell with
[15:42] them Hallelujah they're a fallen States
[15:45] right they they're wanting to move away
[15:48] in Exodus 19 it was the worst mistake
[15:50] the church made right they wanted law
[15:53] over Grace but notice God is still so
[15:56] full of grace that he Prov finds a way
[16:00] he can dwell with them amen and no
[16:02] matter how far you might feel from God
[16:05] even at this moment amen look up for
[16:08] your Redemption dwth nigh amen reach out
[16:11] because the scripture cannot come back
[16:13] void to God he's in this room he wants
[16:16] to feel you he wants you to see his
[16:19] reality he wants you to enter into what
[16:22] his presence
[16:24] amen hallelujah his presence will always
[16:29] bring a move of God Amen Hallelujah
[16:34] brother brandom said God brings his
[16:35] presence to do things I'm paraphrasing
[16:38] that but he said according to all that I
[16:44] sh thee after the pattern of the
[16:47] Tabernacle and and the pattern of all
[16:49] the instruments thereof even so shall ye
[16:53] make it God had a
[16:56] design in his mind
[16:59] that he wanted them to build this
[17:01] Tabernacle now remember these are all
[17:03] types and look at our Prophet said in 62
[17:06] he said now we find that these great
[17:08] Cedars were heed down by huers and they
[17:10] were uh they had the blueprints and they
[17:14] brought them together from different
[17:15] parts of the world now if you notice
[17:17] Solomon never varied one bit from the
[17:21] pattern that Moses saw on Mount Si in
[17:25] heaven Hallelujah Solomon never now
[17:28] think about that if God can do that just
[17:31] from not deviating from the
[17:34] pattern what if you get in one place and
[17:38] one Accord Hallelujah then you will fit
[17:40] the pattern of the word and it will
[17:43] produce the same thing it did then amen
[17:46] no different don't expect anything
[17:49] different Amen brother sister when we
[17:51] baptize in the name of Jesus Christ you
[17:53] should have the ultimate uh uh
[17:56] expectation I will be filled with the
[17:59] Holy Ghost right now
[18:01] amen hallelujah remember it is our
[18:05] responsibility to show that God's word
[18:08] can't
[18:08] lie if God if you follow the acts 238
[18:12] prescription you have to be filled with
[18:14] the Holy Ghost if you believe that if
[18:17] you hold
[18:20] that and it's God's will that we would
[18:24] be able to move right into it now think
[18:27] about how evil are societ
[18:29] and the challenges that this has
[18:31] brought because what it does if the
[18:34] individuals do not move into the
[18:36] fullness of the Holy Spirit the same
[18:37] Bible Holy Spirit it can do nothing but
[18:40] cause divisions yes because self will
[18:45] always what it will always rule above
[18:49] the will of God that's right that's what
[18:51] these seals did for us brother sister it
[18:53] showed us a white horse a red horse a
[18:56] black horse a Pale Horse and it was
[18:59] always man getting moved on by the wrong
[19:02] anointing but you see remember Satan's
[19:06] Creed is not uh do what God says or
[19:09] listen to what Satan says Satan's even
[19:11] the people that wrote the Satanic Bible
[19:14] their motto is do as thou Wilt amen they
[19:18] want you to do what you want to do but
[19:20] the Bride of Jesus Christ says I want to
[19:23] do what you want me to do I want to I
[19:26] want you to be so happy with me amen
[19:29] because I love to do thy will amen
[19:33] hallelujah hallelujah it's all sticking
[19:37] to the
[19:39] pattern he
[19:42] says of course here he is he said that
[19:44] what he said he didn't vary from the
[19:47] pattern that he saw in heaven couldn't
[19:49] do
[19:50] it I wonder what heaven looks
[19:54] like we'll get to it in a
[19:56] minute Moses when he returned from his
[20:00] vision pitched the tent and made it just
[20:04] exactly like he saw in heaven they're
[20:08] all what fulfilling a pattern that they
[20:12] seen in heaven and when Solomon built
[20:14] the temple he made it just exactly the
[20:16] way he seen the pattern the type Moses
[20:19] pitched a tent for a Perpetual type
[20:23] because it moved from place to place now
[20:26] remember what does that mean remember
[20:29] you have son of man Son of God and Son
[20:30] of David right son of man was what now
[20:34] remember when Moses went to Mount Si it
[20:36] was a Emon situation from conception
[20:40] that God gave him in Mount Si to the
[20:43] actual building of the Tabernacle the
[20:45] same cycle of birth right and then it
[20:49] what it birth forth a tabernacle which
[20:51] was something that could be moved to and
[20:53] fro amen but that was not God's ultimate
[20:57] uh uh uh ending point for uh the worship
[21:00] of his dwelling with man amen he would
[21:02] move it from that that moving uh uh
[21:05] Tabernacle to actually a what a temple a
[21:09] stationary place of worship amen that
[21:12] was so powerful that Solomon could even
[21:15] stand right there and said whoever looks
[21:18] to this place amen hallelujah then what
[21:21] if they're in pestilence they'll get
[21:23] healed if they want if they're if
[21:25] they're full of drought God will bring
[21:28] rain amenallah
[21:30] Hallelujah if you look to that Son of
[21:33] God ministration he'll Heal Your Land
[21:36] amen hallelujah what is that it's the
[21:39] filling of the Holy Ghost In You
[21:42] Hallelujah let's
[21:44] continue but Solomon he made the
[21:47] Tabernacle just exactly in the fashion
[21:50] that Moses seen it in heaven it was all
[21:53] put together set in order just exactly
[21:57] what a spiritual application we could
[21:59] apply here that we are never to leave
[22:02] the
[22:03] scripture what's a message believer a
[22:05] believer that doesn't leave the
[22:08] scripture hallelujah hallelujah I don't
[22:10] care if people come up that polygamy is
[22:12] all right it ain't in the word amen
[22:14] they're misinterpreting the word amen
[22:17] yes sir yes
[22:19] sir so he says what that's the reason I
[22:23] believe that the way the first church
[22:25] was patterned that's the way the next
[22:28] one ch should be patterned that's the
[22:29] way everyone should be patterned just
[22:31] the way it was at the beginning and I
[22:33] believe that God has it that way I
[22:35] believe the real church amen so if we
[22:38] want to know exactly what we need to be
[22:40] like it's right here
[22:44] yes is that right hallelujah hallelujah
[22:49] now how hard is it to actually make that
[22:52] live well that's why the message in
[22:54] itself has birthed out in so many
[22:57] different ways
[22:59] why because you see no longer oh God
[23:02] sent a prophet I'm all
[23:04] right the purpose of the Prophet was to
[23:07] bring the church back to the Bible amen
[23:10] hallelujah but you see there's also his
[23:13] Humanity that what is in the tape so you
[23:16] have to take it back to the word right
[23:18] hallelujah hallelujah now not that I
[23:21] have to be brother Brand's corrector or
[23:23] anything like that but you know what if
[23:25] it's something that uh that I I question
[23:27] or something why do you say I should be
[23:29] able to find it here that's right but
[23:31] you know what I found a lot of times
[23:32] it's right in there the whole
[23:34] time Hallelujah now notice they're
[23:37] following this pattern that was set up
[23:41] in heaven right 1 Chronicles 289 he said
[23:44] and thou uh Solomon my son know thou
[23:47] that the god of thy father and serve him
[23:50] with a perfect heart and a willing mind
[23:52] for the Lord searcheth all hearts and
[23:54] understandeth all the imaginations of
[23:56] the thoughts if thou seek Him He will be
[23:58] found of thee amen hallelujah GL
[24:02] Hallelujah if you seek the Lord will he
[24:04] be found of thee Hallelujah if you seek
[24:07] him like Solomon did CU God is not a
[24:09] respector of persons amen hallu he wants
[24:12] you to have a willing mind and a perfect
[24:15] heart right so he
[24:18] says if thou seek Him He will be found
[24:21] of thee but if thou forsake Him He will
[24:24] be cast he will cast thee off forever
[24:26] take heed now for for the Lord had
[24:29] chosen thee to build an house for the
[24:31] sanctuary be strong and do it if you're
[24:35] going to build this house here amen that
[24:38] God called you to dwell into into a
[24:40] place that God's going to be it's going
[24:41] to take some effort amen it's going to
[24:44] take some dying out amen it's going to
[24:46] take some unifying that goes beyond your
[24:49] thoughts amen hallelujah hallelujah
[24:53] because you know what it doesn't matter
[24:55] even as a pastor you know where my
[24:57] issues always come people don't believe
[24:59] the word like I believe
[25:00] it I can try to prove it I can try to
[25:03] but everyone's got their own different
[25:04] idea but what does that really speak to
[25:07] the need
[25:09] of well it speaks to the need that I'm
[25:11] right and you're wrong that doesn't
[25:14] speak for that does it speak that that
[25:17] that
[25:19] uh does it speak that sister zes right
[25:23] and sister Lena is wrong
[25:26] no when it actually speaks if you
[25:29] actually will study your message out it
[25:32] speaks that we should unite in our love
[25:35] for God praying that the Holy Ghost will
[25:39] fill
[25:40] us you ever wonder how how how 1
[25:42] Corinthians 1:10 came about I'm just
[25:44] preaching I hope it's all right uh but 1
[25:46] Corinthians 1:10 they had the same mind
[25:49] the same
[25:50] judgment Hallelujah they had everything
[25:53] the same right they believe the same how
[25:56] in the world could that ever happen only
[25:58] by one way amen and that is everyone
[26:02] coming into the perfect yielding to the
[26:04] Holy Ghost amen hallelujah Glory maybe
[26:08] we'll get to it later but you see it's
[26:11] got to come brother Jess us my sermon on
[26:13] Wednesday I'm burning with it I might
[26:14] even preach tonight I don't know but I
[26:16] am burning because you know what some
[26:18] local body somewhere has to come to in
[26:22] Acts to amen yes sir yes sir that is the
[26:25] thing that the devil fights the most he
[26:28] don't want you to be United he doesn't
[26:31] want you to like each other he doesn't
[26:33] want well why because if it gets in one
[26:36] place in one Accord he's got trouble
[26:38] again
[26:40] amen he don't mind if you unite that you
[26:43] like to fish he don't mind if you you
[26:45] unite because you like the church age
[26:47] book or you don't like it but what he
[26:49] does not want you to do is to unite and
[26:52] say God I am yours I Surrender
[26:55] everything amen hallelujah Glory
[26:58] and then put our Doctrine on the same
[27:00] spot and say
[27:02] Lord I'm going to put a comma right
[27:05] here hallelujah it's easier for us L to
[27:08] sins you're wrong you're wrong you're
[27:09] wrong still
[27:12] right that's a lie of the devil yes
[27:15] sir because if you're not careful you'll
[27:18] get pulled into the
[27:19] Labyrinth hallelujah how many know
[27:21] commenius he talked about in the church
[27:24] age book brother brother brand they
[27:25] brought it out about cenus working with
[27:27] the Labyrinth
[27:28] and I had to step back I had to step
[27:31] back myself because I'm wanting to
[27:34] Hallelujah I feel like God's revealed in
[27:36] the son but I found out you know what
[27:38] there's only one thing that's going to
[27:39] unite us Jesus Christ why is that
[27:43] important because brother brandham said
[27:44] he said the church will get United and
[27:48] then the going away amen amen the bride
[27:51] has to come to
[27:53] Unity how are we going to do that we
[27:55] need the Lord I hope this sermon will
[27:58] help with this Hallelujah if I ever get
[28:01] to it Hallelujah he said then
[28:04] David gave to Solomon his son the
[28:07] pattern of the porch and of the houses
[28:09] thereof and of the treasuries thereof
[28:12] and of the upper chambers thereof and of
[28:13] the inner parlers thereof and of the
[28:15] place of the mercy seat and the pattern
[28:18] of all that he had by the spirit David
[28:22] only gave him the pattern that was by
[28:25] the spirit Hallelujah he didn't give
[28:28] give him his own thoughts well I kind of
[28:30] like I kind of like roses over here or I
[28:32] like he did not do that but he gave what
[28:35] he was so in tune with the spirit that
[28:38] he gave Solomon the one who would build
[28:41] the temple exactly what he seen and he
[28:44] knew it was God
[28:46] Amen Hallelujah
[28:49] Hallelujah also for the courses of the
[28:52] priests and the Levites for all the work
[28:53] of the service of the house of the Lord
[28:54] and for the vessels of service in the
[28:56] house of the Lord all right
[28:59] amen you see we not only have a Bible
[29:03] that shows us everything how it happened
[29:06] so we could learn from it we could catch
[29:09] a revelation of
[29:12] it but we have a Holy Spirit who has
[29:17] called us to
[29:19] overcome the division that we see in the
[29:21] message even now for the elect don't get
[29:25] it wrong just CU you're in the message
[29:27] does not mean you're going to make a
[29:29] Rapture I'm hearing everybody say it now
[29:31] and it's true Hallelujah I've been
[29:32] saying it for a while
[29:33] myself hallelujah what is so close it
[29:36] would deceive the elected if possible
[29:38] right yes sir you don't got to worry
[29:41] about the
[29:42] Presbyterian you don't got to worry
[29:44] about the
[29:46] Episcopalian even the
[29:49] Baptist and what we love everybody
[29:52] everywhere Hallelujah but it's really
[29:55] come time that there's one thing we've
[29:57] got to really agree on and is how to get
[29:59] everyone filled with the Holy Spirit yes
[30:04] Hallelujah just saying what's
[30:07] coming there we see brother and sister
[30:10] you got your Tabernacle of course the
[30:12] tent or the the badger skin everything
[30:13] could be taken down move Solomon's
[30:15] Temple
[30:17] Grandeur and if you actually study the
[30:19] types out you will find that what that
[30:22] the T the temple was actually twice as
[30:25] big as the Tabernacle it was literally a
[30:28] double portion from what the Tabernacle
[30:33] was Hallelujah meaning what that the Son
[30:37] of God ministration by the Holy Spirit
[30:40] it would be God's desire to give those
[30:43] anointed ones a double portion of his
[30:45] spirit amen hallelujah don't belittle
[30:48] what God wants you to be don't belittle
[30:51] what what don't belittle what the
[30:53] scripture says you are
[30:56] amen you are a messiah
[30:59] at you are an amateur God Amen what
[31:03] separates us from that a revelation yes
[31:08] because we don't believe that well why
[31:11] cuz your phone's telling you you're
[31:13] not your phone's trying to keep you tied
[31:15] on to the
[31:16] Earth your fellowships your job
[31:19] everything is trying to tell
[31:22] you that you're not perfectly in tune
[31:25] with God to do this right but the word
[31:28] says you are amen hallelujah well if we
[31:32] only had the
[31:36] blood Glory let's go a little bit
[31:39] farther how many like uh talk about the
[31:42] tribulation those are some of the things
[31:43] that got me really excited it's a lot
[31:45] happier to talk about if you're not
[31:47] going to be here I would say anybody
[31:49] agree with that Hallelujah uh we're in
[31:51] anxious times because the these are the
[31:53] times it looks like it's getting ready
[31:54] to birth Now isn't it amen uh notice uh
[31:57] I probably jump here
[31:58] uh in a moment here but he said
[31:59] Revelations 11:15 which is talking about
[32:01] the Jews right and the temple and
[32:02] everything like that it said and the
[32:03] seventh angel sounded and there were
[32:05] great voices in heaven saying the
[32:07] kingdoms of this world are become the
[32:09] kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ
[32:14] and he shall reign Forever and Ever
[32:17] After these two prophets roll out
[32:20] Hallelujah the seventh angel sounds amen
[32:23] we work with the Bible version with
[32:24] brother Jesse There showing that all
[32:26] those new versions tell you that that uh
[32:28] seventh angel here is the same one that
[32:30] you see in Revelations 10:7 but that is
[32:32] not true amen God sent us Revelation
[32:36] that what as he had declared to his
[32:38] servants the prophets amen not some
[32:40] Heavenly Angel this is what the Earthly
[32:43] seventh angel brother brandom amen
[32:46] that's right Hallelujah now watch so
[32:48] things are now coming to a close uh
[32:52] let's just this is good enough tell you
[32:54] what for the tribulation this is all I
[32:55] really need to know and the nations were
[32:57] angry I bet they they were they got hard
[32:59] times coming right Mercy's
[33:02] over and the temple 19th verse of God
[33:06] was opened in
[33:08] heaven and there was seen in his Temple
[33:12] the Ark of his
[33:17] Testament Ron Wyatt found it though
[33:19] brother sister or it's here or it's
[33:22] there it's in Ethiopia it's
[33:25] there right now in a real
[33:29] form there's actually a temple of God in
[33:33] heaven and there is an arc of his
[33:36] Testament right there what is that
[33:38] actually showing it's showing that it
[33:40] followed the pattern that God showed him
[33:43] here now watch he says and there were
[33:45] Lightnings voices thunderings and
[33:48] earthquake and great hail judgment the
[33:51] the seven trumpet it's over that
[33:53] tribulation is over yes
[33:59] as our Prophet talked about he said that
[34:01] Sanctuary will become
[34:05] smoky it's
[34:08] over again Revelations 155 and after
[34:12] that I looked and behold talking about
[34:14] the seven vials the Temple of the
[34:16] Tabernacle of the testimony in heaven
[34:19] was
[34:20] opened and the Seven Angels came out of
[34:23] the temple having the seven plagues uh
[34:25] clothed in pure and white linen and
[34:26] having their breast girded with giren
[34:28] girdles and one of the four beasts gave
[34:31] un the seven angels seven golden vials
[34:32] full of the wrath of God who liveth
[34:34] forever and ever amen how many know have
[34:37] you studied your message brother Brandon
[34:39] was longing to preach on these things
[34:41] that's right didn't get there did he and
[34:44] the temple was filled with smoke from
[34:47] the glory of God and from his power and
[34:51] no man was able to enter into the temple
[34:55] till the seven plagues of the seven
[34:57] Angels were
[35:00] fulfilled the
[35:04] tribulation Grace
[35:06] over now I find this very interesting
[35:10] because it says and no man was able to
[35:12] enter into the
[35:14] temple well what man's up there going in
[35:17] the
[35:19] temple I'll leave that one for your
[35:22] pastor Hallelujah I've heard you
[35:24] children ask questions stay away from me
[35:29] I'm just joking so notice there's a Time
[35:35] coming where the temple in heaven is
[35:39] going to go from a mercy seat to a
[35:43] judgment
[35:45] seat
[35:47] Hallelujah Hebrews 9:22 and almost all
[35:50] things are by the law purged with
[35:54] blood and without shedding of blood
[35:57] there is no remission it takes shedding
[36:02] of blood to remit or do away with sin
[36:06] amen
[36:09] hallelujah it was therefore necessary
[36:12] that the patterns of things in the
[36:13] heavens should be purified with these
[36:17] did you did you catch that it was
[36:20] therefore necessary that the patterns of
[36:21] things in heaven should be purified with
[36:25] these yes heaven
[36:28] itself would need the
[36:30] purification of
[36:33] blood yes not making stuff up I'm
[36:36] reading you the
[36:38] Bible
[36:39] Hallelujah so it says it was uh but the
[36:44] Heavenly things themselves with better
[36:47] sacrifices than these for Christ has not
[36:52] entered yes yes for Christ has not
[36:56] entered into the holy H places made with
[37:00] hands I'm saying where did Christ go
[37:04] when he
[37:07] ascended Hallelujah where's he
[37:11] at now that's why I'm so glad that we
[37:14] have a God that can be as omnipresent as
[37:15] he wants to be Hallelujah I'm so glad I
[37:19] got a God who who can want he can he can
[37:22] worry about uh akan Ohio the same time
[37:26] he's worrying about Nigeria
[37:29] IA he can worry about Nigeria let me say
[37:32] he's not worrying because he already
[37:33] knows what's going to happen right but
[37:35] what he can think on those needs that
[37:36] they have the same time he's thinking
[37:38] about the needs in China amen down in
[37:41] Mexico Guyana wherever he is he is an
[37:44] omnipotent omniscient God Amen
[37:47] Hallelujah he ever lives to make
[37:52] intercession Hallelujah this is where it
[37:56] has to be a person no
[38:00] Revelation it has to be cuz if God is
[38:04] not thinking about you or doesn't have
[38:07] time for you you're literally in the
[38:10] same spot Israel was when a uh
[38:13] Elijah said why H between between two
[38:17] opinions if he's god let's serve
[38:20] him you would have a same God as
[38:26] baale right because when they were
[38:28] trying to get baale to move on their
[38:31] behalf to drop the fire on the
[38:40] sacrifice Bale could not interceed for
[38:44] their
[38:46] needs
[38:48] Hallelujah there is a God who could
[38:51] answer by setting the sacrifice on fire
[38:55] amenallah don't you he is just a type of
[38:58] the pouring out of the Holy Ghost on the
[39:01] church
[39:02] amen hallelujah hallelujah but Elijah
[39:06] had to mock them where is your god is he
[39:09] on vacation uh is he is he sick where is
[39:12] this God you
[39:14] have now how come Elijah could do that
[39:18] to them but they couldn't do it to
[39:23] Elijah and what type of believer should
[39:27] we be right now
[39:29] amen notice Elisha was actually trying
[39:33] to set the church in
[39:35] order he was trying to bring them under
[39:39] the right type of
[39:41] sacrifice Hallelujah and what did God
[39:45] answer by fire yes he did
[39:49] amen no wonder the prophet said he said
[39:52] what he said if if if you are a
[39:55] sacrifice and and the sacrifice is made
[39:58] perfect God was what he'll pour out the
[40:00] fire on
[40:02] you Hallelujah he brings it down you're
[40:06] just like that sacrifice yes why isn't
[40:10] God setting it on fire he just don't
[40:13] care about me woe is
[40:16] me I've been praying for this for a long
[40:23] time if God be with us where are all the
[40:26] Miracles
[40:31] we separate ourselves yes sir yes sir it
[40:34] they had to leave Jehovah to go to Baal
[40:38] that's right brother good and you know
[40:40] why because they were more interested in
[40:43] numbers and
[40:44] popularity than the true Elijah message
[40:47] of the hour if you hear what I'm saying
[40:51] yes sir they were more interested in
[40:55] programs where they could have a form of
[40:57] God right right they could copy off of
[41:01] denominations why am I going this
[41:03] [Music]
[41:04] way but you see even when you find
[41:08] yourself under the truth of that moving
[41:11] you still have to live it out
[41:17] amen no wonder the scriptures got all
[41:19] these things remember them lepers them
[41:21] lepers were full of sin they had the
[41:23] Assyrian army ready to go get
[41:25] them and the scripture remember there
[41:28] they were starving to death there's an
[41:30] Elisha in the land but they were
[41:32] starving to death and they said why sit
[41:34] we here it's better to chance Dying With
[41:37] the
[41:39] Enemy and they went out to a defeated
[41:43] Foe and found all that they needed all
[41:47] their hearts content because they were
[41:50] the first ones that got away from being
[41:53] scared of the enemy and just got in and
[41:56] started fighting for God Amen
[41:59] Hallelujah
[42:01] Hallelujah Hallelujah they weren't
[42:03] worried about it anymore they got tired
[42:06] of not getting fed
[42:10] amen they got tired of sitting under the
[42:13] word hungry you don't sit under the word
[42:16] hungry amen you are the one anointed of
[42:19] God to bring that Holy Ghost down amen
[42:22] you are called for it you are that name
[42:25] that was on that book it was your your
[42:27] name
[42:28] amen God
[42:37] Hallelujah for Christ has not entered
[42:39] into the holy places made with hands
[42:42] which are the figures of the true God
[42:44] didn't need hands to build the temple in
[42:48] heaven but it still needed
[42:53] blood but into heaven
[42:55] itself now to appear in the presence of
[43:00] God for
[43:02] himself somebody caught me good good you
[43:06] supposed to catch me no brother no
[43:08] brother that's a lot of issues with
[43:10] people in the message nowadays they
[43:11] don't they don't challenge nothing they
[43:13] get heard right they're preaching this
[43:15] message is the absolute preachers are up
[43:17] there saying don't even search it out
[43:19] said we got it covered just listen to
[43:21] what we say huh that's a message Pope
[43:24] right there when he's trying to separate
[43:26] you from the word of God from the
[43:29] message of the
[43:30] hour that's a pope because it's the same
[43:33] thing Catholicism did yes sir they what
[43:36] their first big idea was to what not
[43:40] what they first tried to kill the elect
[43:42] but then they had a better plan that
[43:44] they would take the Bible away from the
[43:46] common
[43:47] people how' they do that destroyed as
[43:50] many bibles as possible and what put the
[43:53] Bible in Jerome's Latin Vulgate cuz
[43:55] Latin was a dead language so no body
[43:57] understood it think about it it's always
[44:00] Satan's strategy to separate the Ley
[44:04] from the word brother good if he can
[44:08] separate you from the word he's broke
[44:11] the power Amen to deliver you to set you
[44:14] free to what to live in the power of
[44:17] this moment right now it might be dark
[44:20] outside but there's lights in this room
[44:22] amen hallelujah there's what there's an
[44:25] anointing that's more real than anything
[44:28] in this room
[44:30] amen tap into it how do I tap into it
[44:34] give yourself to
[44:37] it don't wait on it you move by faith
[44:41] I'm sure your pastors preached on it how
[44:43] many times brother Brandon was sitting
[44:44] there and say say brother you have this
[44:46] type and this type of issue he says
[44:48] hurry up make a move believe it then
[44:51] then you'd hear a little pause you say
[44:53] it's shame on you you missed it
[44:57] that individual had to go the rest of
[44:58] his life missing a healing though God
[45:02] himself settled on him because the
[45:05] prophet seen the light and he seen it
[45:08] move well thank god brother cam there's
[45:10] no light in this room like that right
[45:12] now that's not true correct the preacher
[45:16] again right brother yes sir Hallelujah
[45:21] brother sister I I seen the I seen the
[45:22] pillar of fire in our church we had a
[45:25] visiting preacher from Ghana
[45:27] and he was up there just preaching a
[45:29] token getting with us like 10 years
[45:31] ago anyway he's preaching it getting
[45:35] it and I'm I'm standing over here I'm
[45:37] like amen doing my thing and I look and
[45:41] I'm
[45:43] like there's a pillar of fire over his
[45:47] left
[45:49] shoulder and I so I'm like I know I'm
[45:51] seeing something so I'm like go like
[45:55] this I start moving around like yeah
[45:58] that's a pillar of
[46:00] fire I'm like Hallelujah but then when I
[46:04] went like this I was looking at the
[46:06] preacher and all of a sudden I noticed
[46:09] it wasn't on the preacher it was on
[46:11] brother Dave
[46:12] Lewellen on his right
[46:16] shoulder I thought it was on the
[46:19] preacher because of where I was standing
[46:21] but when I moved I found out because
[46:24] obviously you had the preacher here and
[46:25] brother Dave was right here
[46:27] but when I moved I realized it was on
[46:29] brother Dave and not on the
[46:32] preacher how is that possible that the
[46:36] pillar of fire could be on someone
[46:38] outside of a
[46:43] Preacher but it it is made that
[46:46] way the same light that was on those
[46:49] individuals and brother brandom's
[46:51] meetings is the same light that will be
[46:53] on you if you can only come to a
[46:56] conscious state that he is here
[47:01] amen
[47:03] hallelujah why did he not continue his
[47:06] work on
[47:07] Earth because he had to go to heaven
[47:11] why now to appear in the presence of God
[47:16] for us thank you Lord for you thank you
[47:20] Lord so when he showed up did that end
[47:23] it was he done then
[47:28] think about it in Revelations 12 there's
[47:31] a time when it says the accuser of the
[47:33] Brethren is cast
[47:37] out who's that the
[47:41] devil the devil actually comes to a spot
[47:44] he's cast
[47:46] out but why is he up there he is the
[47:50] accuser of the
[47:52] Brethren are you a brother he's accusing
[47:56] you
[47:57] you glad about that if you know that
[47:59] you're pretty glad about that right
[48:02] hallelujah hallelujah cuz you've got
[48:05] somebody remember you have someone
[48:08] standing in the gap for you you have a
[48:11] mediator that is sitting in heaven right
[48:14] now for you amen
[48:17] hallelujah
[48:22] hallelujah nor yet that he should offer
[48:25] himself often as the high priest
[48:27] entereth into the holy place every year
[48:28] with the blood of others for then must
[48:30] he often have suffered since the
[48:33] foundation of the world but now once in
[48:35] the end of the world hath he appeared to
[48:37] put away sin by the sacrifice of himself
[48:40] sin he put it
[48:44] away you realize when you commit a sin
[48:47] after service he doesn't have to die for
[48:49] it
[48:52] again it was once and for all I think
[48:57] after 2,000 years he's got this
[49:00] down I think he's got it figured out
[49:03] what figured out how to guard you at the
[49:08] throne
[49:09] amen from All Saints
[49:12] attacks I always say this you hear me
[49:14] say it
[49:15] again but you know what a lot of times
[49:18] everybody wants to say their
[49:20] job but you realize probably 99% of the
[49:22] time you ain't
[49:24] job you just sin too much yes sir you're
[49:27] just too complacent yes sir you're too
[49:30] involved yes sir with the Affairs of
[49:33] this life and God is trying to get you
[49:36] right he has a plan for you he has an
[49:39] anointing for you think about it there's
[49:41] nine spiritual gifts that are supposed
[49:44] to operate right in here
[49:47] nine that those aren't brother Jesse's
[49:49] nine
[49:50] gifts
[49:53] amen nine gifts that God made to get
[49:57] filled with the Holy Ghost and then he
[49:59] would be able to watch give these gifts
[50:02] unto
[50:04] men it's God's grace that he doesn't
[50:07] give the gifts to us when our character
[50:09] is not right cuz power without character
[50:13] is
[50:14] satanic think about it there even John
[50:17] was without the character of God and
[50:20] when Jesus was to go into that City they
[50:23] didn't want him and John says give us
[50:26] the ility I'll call fire on he from
[50:28] Heaven on
[50:29] them what was that even in a Sanctified
[50:33] State he did not have the character to
[50:36] wield the power of
[50:39] God we cannot be satisfied with a
[50:42] Sanctified life Hallelujah we've got to
[50:46] move into the full mind of Christ amen
[50:51] hallelujah
[50:54] hallelujah let's see what he said he
[50:56] cares do you care
[50:58] Hallelujah when he was here on Earth as
[51:01] I say he cared for the people so much
[51:03] till he healed their sick comforted
[51:05] their hearts told them about a place
[51:08] that where he would go and prepare for
[51:10] them and would come again to receive
[51:12] them un himself he cared for them and
[51:14] notice he cared so much
[51:17] until when he knowed he must leave in
[51:21] order to bring this great thing to us he
[51:23] said I'll not leave you comfortless but
[51:25] I will send the Holy Spirit and he he
[51:26] shall continue my care for you until he
[51:28] returns there's no one that cares like
[51:33] Jesus
[51:35] hallu who cares the most for you in your
[51:39] life
[51:41] yes I don't mean to say it but I'm going
[51:43] to say
[51:45] it if your first thought about someone
[51:49] caring for you is someone physical
[51:58] then you're already in the wrong spot
[52:00] yes sir yes sir what is that showing
[52:03] that's showing a disconnect in your
[52:05] relationship with God yes
[52:08] sir yes that's serious it's very serious
[52:11] because you know what when I'm preaching
[52:13] this you might say yes amen yes amen but
[52:15] what about those last decisions you made
[52:17] yes sir
[52:19] Hallelujah I'm a pastor I find when
[52:22] people need money they don't go to God
[52:24] first they go to God first
[52:27] first they make the preacher their
[52:30] answer they make the preacher their God
[52:33] the one that's going to provide for him
[52:35] the one that's going to do everything
[52:36] they need him to do it wasn't meant to
[52:39] be like that it was meant to be you in
[52:42] an Eden State sitting there with Papa
[52:45] God
[52:47] Amen the blood was actually shed to
[52:51] bring you back to the Eden Fellowship
[52:53] brother sister you know that quote I've
[52:56] said it before
[52:57] watch this knowing that his body as a
[53:02] high priest in IMM mediatorial work that
[53:06] he's doing now that body must be in the
[53:10] presence of God at all
[53:15] times for intercession that God cannot
[53:19] see the sinner's
[53:22] sin he sees only the blood
[53:27] of his own
[53:30] son why is he
[53:33] there why is he in heaven right
[53:36] now because every time you
[53:39] fail he is standing in heaven in the gap
[53:44] for
[53:45] you
[53:48] Hallelujah I don't even know if I'll get
[53:50] to this quote but you know what brother
[53:52] brandham said he said if God is not at
[53:54] the mercy seat right now he said God
[53:56] cannot hear your
[53:58] prayer
[54:01] right
[54:02] Hallelujah so that means if he is there
[54:06] if you believe he's there then that
[54:09] means he'll hear your
[54:16] prayer and knowing that he sent back the
[54:20] Holy Spirit to continue to comfort his
[54:22] people does he care certainly he cares
[54:24] now he was to continue to care for his
[54:26] people for the people his people here on
[54:28] Earth in the same manner that he cared
[54:31] for them when he was
[54:33] here did you get that yes can God alter
[54:38] his care for you right now differently
[54:42] than what his care was for you when he
[54:45] was here on
[54:47] Earth he can't
[54:50] right so you can literally look into the
[54:53] Bible and where it talks about Jesus and
[54:56] it said he had compassion on them he
[54:58] healed them
[55:00] all he cannot care for you any less than
[55:06] what he did for them
[55:11] there don't you see brother Brandon was
[55:14] not crazy when he said if our faith
[55:16] could get to this this spot right here
[55:18] there wouldn't be a sick person here in
[55:21] five minutes
[55:26] but what is it it's a
[55:31] revelation hold on with me because you
[55:34] have to realize that this blood is shed
[55:37] for each one of
[55:39] you this blood is still the same for you
[55:44] think about this if you could catch that
[55:46] Revelation then what about the pouring
[55:48] out of the Holy Ghost right
[55:50] now I got a powerful quote it's
[55:54] coming Hallelujah
[55:58] acts 1:6 it says and when they therefore
[56:00] were come together they asked of him
[56:02] saying Lord wilt thou at this time
[56:04] restore again the Kingdom of Israel and
[56:06] he said unto them it is not for you to
[56:09] know the times or the seasons which the
[56:12] father ha put in his
[56:13] power but ye shall receive power after
[56:18] that the Holy Ghost is come upon you
[56:22] when was the power coming after the holy
[56:26] Holy Ghost had come upon them
[56:32] Hallelujah and ye shall be Witnesses
[56:35] unto me both in
[56:37] Jerusalem in all Judea Samaria and under
[56:41] the uttermost part of the earth and when
[56:43] he had spoken these things while they
[56:45] beheld he was taken up and a cloud
[56:48] received him out of their
[56:51] sight they wanted the restoration right
[56:54] there but he had had something better
[56:57] for them at that
[56:59] time but notice where did he go he went
[57:03] back to
[57:07] heaven and while they looked steadfastly
[57:10] towards heaven as he went up behold the
[57:13] two men stood by them in white apparel
[57:15] which also said ye men of Galilee why
[57:17] stand ye gazing up into heaven this same
[57:20] Jesus uh which is taken up from you into
[57:23] heaven shall so come and like man as you
[57:26] have seen him go into the heaven into
[57:29] heaven what notice what they're doing
[57:32] God told them to go wait in Jerusalem go
[57:35] Terry yes but what were they more
[57:38] interested at
[57:40] doing they were more interested in
[57:43] watching a God go away from
[57:45] them right than to actually do what the
[57:47] word told them to do yes sir you realize
[57:51] the same thing happened when brother
[57:52] Brandon was taken off the scene
[57:59] it's the same thing when Elijah was
[58:01] raptured it's the same thing every time
[58:04] that people become more fixated on the
[58:06] man of God right than the actual word
[58:10] that they're supposed to carry
[58:11] out think about it that's right that
[58:16] type they should have been more trained
[58:19] on what Elisha was
[58:22] doing now notice Elisha had that he had
[58:25] the manle come come on him he wasn't
[58:28] fooled did did Elisha go out and and and
[58:32] go search in the wilderness for 3 days
[58:33] with all the sons of the prophets he
[58:35] wasn't worried about that why cuz he had
[58:39] The Mantel and he went to the Jordan and
[58:41] smoted it and said where is the god of
[58:48] Elijah where's the god of Elijah brother
[58:50] sister
[58:52] yes
[58:53] Hallelujah where's he at I'm telling you
[58:57] he's
[58:58] waiting I had the brother preach just a
[59:00] few weeks ago and he said he says we're
[59:02] not waiting on God God's waiting on us
[59:06] and that's the fact God is waiting on us
[59:09] to get away from everything and get
[59:12] fully into
[59:15] him
[59:19] hallelujah it's one of my favorite
[59:21] quotes I hope it's one of your favorites
[59:23] too after I read it patas Vision he said
[59:27] the lamp was lit in a special way first
[59:30] the priest took fire from the sacred
[59:31] altar which was originally lighted by
[59:34] the fire of God he lit first of all the
[59:36] lamp that was sitting on top of the bowl
[59:38] uh he then lit the second lamp from the
[59:40] flame of the first lamp the third lamp
[59:43] received its fire from the second lamp
[59:45] as did the fourth receive it from the
[59:48] third and so on until all seven lamps
[59:51] were
[59:53] burning this Holy Fire
[59:56] from the altar being passed from lamp to
[1:00:00] lamp is a wonderful type of the holy
[1:00:04] spirit in the seven Church ages the
[1:00:07] original outpouring of Pentecost I'm so
[1:00:10] glad these parentheses are
[1:00:14] here
[1:00:15] hallelujah which outpouring came direct
[1:00:20] from Jesus on The Mercy Seat
[1:00:26] where did that outpouring in Acts two
[1:00:28] come
[1:00:30] from Jesus where was he at the mercy SE
[1:00:35] where in heaven
[1:00:39] yes so when the Holy Ghost fell on
[1:00:46] them what actually was that going
[1:00:52] on Jesus applied the blood to the Mercy
[1:00:56] Seat in
[1:01:00] heaven and what did that
[1:01:03] produce It produced an
[1:01:07] outpouring wait a
[1:01:11] minute if the blood of The Mercy Seat
[1:01:14] could produce an outpouring
[1:01:18] then if we have a
[1:01:20] revelation of where the blood is who is
[1:01:24] applying that blood and his intention
[1:01:27] for the
[1:01:28] blood then it can place us into a spot
[1:01:32] that Jesus can do wonderful things from
[1:01:34] The Mercy Seat in
[1:01:36] heaven
[1:01:38] hall now if you believe he's left that
[1:01:41] Mercy Seat you got problems yes sir but
[1:01:44] if you can see that there's a God that
[1:01:47] is still making intercession for
[1:01:51] you it makes no wonder Jesus said all
[1:01:55] things are
[1:01:59] possible think about it right now in
[1:02:02] akan
[1:02:03] Ohio the dimension of Heaven is around
[1:02:06] us moving faster you can't see it you
[1:02:09] can't feel it but it's there but also in
[1:02:13] that seventh Dimension is the mercy SE
[1:02:16] in the temple in heaven
[1:02:20] Hallelujah and he's wanting to know your
[1:02:25] request by the Revelation that you
[1:02:29] have
[1:02:31] remember don't get tired of me now hold
[1:02:34] on because if you can see he cares about
[1:02:38] you right
[1:02:41] now if you can see when that act church
[1:02:45] was just a big bunch of cowards they
[1:02:47] weren't winning a lot of souls they
[1:02:49] weren't catching a lot of
[1:02:51] seed was seed there seed was there
[1:02:56] no wonder this pouring out from The
[1:02:59] Mercy Seat caused a Revival to bring
[1:03:03] 3,000
[1:03:06] in hallelujah what was
[1:03:10] it they
[1:03:12] fulfilled the word of God and when it
[1:03:15] struck they had it
[1:03:22] Hallelujah so by the scripture they
[1:03:24] would have to wait till the day of
[1:03:25] Pentecost 50
[1:03:30] days what about you sister beatric how
[1:03:33] long you got to wait s Carris how long
[1:03:36] you got to
[1:03:40] wait no wonder he said it's not for you
[1:03:43] to know the times and
[1:03:45] Seasons no wonder what what are you
[1:03:49] trying to say brother C I ain't trying
[1:03:50] to hold you long I'm trying to get you
[1:03:52] this thought because if you can
[1:03:55] understand
[1:03:56] how real God wants to be in your life
[1:03:59] right
[1:04:00] now not just that he wants to be real
[1:04:04] but he's actually there wanting to be
[1:04:06] real with a blood that God cannot even
[1:04:10] impute iniquity upon
[1:04:12] you Hallelujah meaning what that you are
[1:04:15] in the very righteousness of God in
[1:04:21] him Hallelujah so what is it
[1:04:26] is end doing his church through all the
[1:04:29] seven Church ages and showing perfectly
[1:04:32] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:04:34] today and forever the never changing God
[1:04:36] in his Essence and his
[1:04:38] ways he's at the mercy seat in heaven
[1:04:42] that's really close to us right now we
[1:04:44] can't see it we're a little
[1:04:51] slow no wonder so tell me when brother
[1:04:55] talked about Heavenly places what did he
[1:04:57] talk
[1:04:59] about when he talked about you getting
[1:05:01] in that Heavenly place he said time
[1:05:02] could just pass he said you just got in
[1:05:04] Heavenly places time was gone yes what
[1:05:07] were you actually entering
[1:05:12] into it made that long-winded preacher
[1:05:15] seem like it was just a
[1:05:16] minute but why was that because you were
[1:05:20] more into the word and what the word was
[1:05:23] trying to direct you yes connect you
[1:05:27] with then actually the element of time
[1:05:30] that's telling you you're hungry that's
[1:05:32] telling you you're tired that's telling
[1:05:35] you oh God let him
[1:05:38] stop not in this room of course that's
[1:05:40] other places
[1:05:42] but but what is it we even when we come
[1:05:46] to the house of God remember brother
[1:05:48] Brown said we have to make it count
[1:05:50] especially when we come to the house of
[1:05:53] God why is that because now by the
[1:05:57] foolishness of preaching the holy spirit
[1:05:59] is a mouthpiece speaking his promises
[1:06:02] unto
[1:06:03] you don't you see this this is
[1:06:08] redemption the product of redemption
[1:06:12] that is sitting in your midst meaning
[1:06:15] what he cannot change his essence or his
[1:06:20] ways if he poured out on them if you got
[1:06:23] in that same spot by what by faith he
[1:06:27] will pour out on
[1:06:29] you
[1:06:32] Hallelujah see a lot of times a lot of
[1:06:34] times we're looking for power we're
[1:06:36] looking for Supernatural but you know
[1:06:37] what God wants to give you probably more
[1:06:39] than anything else he wants to to give
[1:06:40] you the benefit of having the holy
[1:06:42] spirit in you the same way he gave it in
[1:06:44] the Bible I preached a sermon a while
[1:06:47] ago that we don't need brother man said
[1:06:48] he don't want to give you a different
[1:06:50] Holy Ghost right he don't want to give
[1:06:52] you a different Holy Ghost that's got
[1:06:54] power every now and then
[1:06:57] 64 question answers brother Bram said he
[1:06:59] said if you were in harmony he said the
[1:07:00] signs and wonders would be multiplying
[1:07:02] around you
[1:07:08] constantly if Jesus was only
[1:07:14] here you see how Jesus made it though he
[1:07:17] made it so the only way you can tap in
[1:07:20] it's by
[1:07:21] faith you have to believe it you have to
[1:07:25] believe right now he has you on his mind
[1:07:28] you have to believe it that that need
[1:07:31] that he's placed in your life whether
[1:07:33] it's physical or spiritual right now you
[1:07:35] can have that don't you see that's why
[1:07:38] he revealed uh acts 10 with Peter and
[1:07:41] the Gentiles while the word was preached
[1:07:44] the Holy Ghost fell on them amen all
[1:07:47] those Gentiles would have to do is hear
[1:07:50] the word and the Holy Ghost would fall
[1:07:52] on them
[1:07:55] wait they didn't have to go 50
[1:07:58] days all they had to do is hear the
[1:08:00] word I'm not worthy of you coming to my
[1:08:02] roof just say the word and it'll
[1:08:07] happen they had a revelation of who they
[1:08:10] were they had a revelation of their
[1:08:14] Authority it was God that chose you to
[1:08:16] be in this room it was God that chose
[1:08:18] you to be in this church amen it was God
[1:08:21] that is what perfecting you here but
[1:08:24] what his design
[1:08:26] is to manifest himself greater in your
[1:08:28] midst
[1:08:33] Hallelujah that's what he did now notice
[1:08:36] when he come to the scene in Revelations
[1:08:39] 5 there it was calls him a
[1:08:41] lion but when he came out what did they
[1:08:44] see a
[1:08:46] lamb he stood as it had been
[1:08:49] slain one of the most interesting things
[1:08:51] you could probably ever do is get on
[1:08:53] Google and look at all the pictures
[1:08:54] people have for this
[1:08:56] they got little sheep with with seven
[1:08:58] eyes and seven horns they anything you
[1:09:00] can think of it's hard to find it right
[1:09:04] actually I never found it
[1:09:06] right but there it was that slain lamb
[1:09:10] what still in a spot of
[1:09:13] intercession still intercessing for your
[1:09:16] needs Hallelujah did you hear that your
[1:09:21] needs brother Austin's needs our sister
[1:09:24] here your needs
[1:09:25] sister Naomi
[1:09:28] needes right now he cares for whatever
[1:09:32] is on your
[1:09:35] heart and the devil's right there to
[1:09:37] stand and say yeah but you've never got
[1:09:39] it before oh you've tried that a lot of
[1:09:45] times oh
[1:09:48] Hallelujah I got to come to a
[1:09:53] close watch he says
[1:09:56] remember the old in the Old Testament as
[1:09:58] long as the blood was off The Mercy Seat
[1:10:01] it was judgment but as long as the blood
[1:10:04] was on there there was Mercy but when
[1:10:07] the lamb walked away that did it he was
[1:10:11] the only man that was worthy here he
[1:10:13] come from the intercessory box what's he
[1:10:16] coming for now watch him John was
[1:10:18] weeping where's it all at what's going
[1:10:20] to happen he said don't weep John said
[1:10:22] the Elder here comes the lion he was the
[1:10:24] one prevailing Ked and when he looked
[1:10:26] here come a lamb bloody that had been
[1:10:29] slain anything that's killed is bloody
[1:10:32] you know been killed its neck's been
[1:10:34] chopped or something open or something
[1:10:37] the blood's all over it here come a lamb
[1:10:39] been slain and he came forth oh my what
[1:10:42] to make claims on his Redemption amen he
[1:10:46] said oh I don't you just feel like just
[1:10:48] going over in a corner and sit down and
[1:10:52] cry a while
[1:10:58] you realize he can't do that until
[1:10:59] you're
[1:11:07] done till he's done with
[1:11:10] you right have you come to the
[1:11:13] Revelation he can't leave intercession
[1:11:15] until he's got me done CU I'm his I'm
[1:11:18] his bride I'm his child I'm a son I'm a
[1:11:21] daughter I'm a Child of God Amen
[1:11:24] Hallelujah he I want you have recognized
[1:11:27] that he is the author of your
[1:11:32] faith who started your
[1:11:35] faith if he started your faith he was
[1:11:39] also made to be the finisher of your
[1:11:44] faith Hallelujah that's the that's a
[1:11:47] danger in arminianism it wasn't well we
[1:11:50] kind of did it together or I I love him
[1:11:52] first we had nothing to do with it he
[1:11:55] first loved us he was the one that loved
[1:11:57] you even when you were in denomination
[1:11:59] or wherever you were and brought you to
[1:12:01] the message of the hour he didn't bring
[1:12:03] you in this message to not make a
[1:12:05] Rapture he brought you into this message
[1:12:08] to catch a revelation of the blood to
[1:12:10] catch a revelation of who you are and to
[1:12:13] manifest his mind to this world
[1:12:16] Amen
[1:12:18] Hallelujah you have the rights of
[1:12:20] redemption right now his rights are
[1:12:23] taking you but your rides is everything
[1:12:27] he purchased through the
[1:12:29] blood a right mind you want it you got
[1:12:32] it you want Deliverance he's right there
[1:12:35] with a blood that can take it away from
[1:12:39] you if you only lay it down oh I need
[1:12:43] more help with my will oh that's right
[1:12:45] his blood will take care of that
[1:12:47] too I've tried 10 times his blood will
[1:12:50] take care of that
[1:12:51] too hallelujah look at the quotes
[1:12:55] brother Bram said he said it don't
[1:12:56] matter if you've tried six times to get
[1:12:58] the Holy
[1:13:00] Ghost he says today is a different
[1:13:07] day I don't know about you I don't want
[1:13:10] a different Holy Ghost I want the holy
[1:13:14] ghost that this talks
[1:13:17] about I want a holy ghost that's making
[1:13:20] Satan get worried amen
[1:13:25] theology is not making the devil get
[1:13:26] worried brother sister right
[1:13:29] lukewarmness is not going to make him
[1:13:30] worry that's right but when you can get
[1:13:33] to the spot where you can identify that
[1:13:36] what you're packing can be a lot more
[1:13:38] potent than what it
[1:13:40] is I ain't telling nobody ain't got the
[1:13:42] Holy Ghost but what I'm saying is God
[1:13:43] has a real Holy Ghost and it will look
[1:13:45] exactly like
[1:13:47] this no
[1:13:49] wonder he said brother brandom said he
[1:13:52] said if this Vine ever gives birth to
[1:13:54] another branch
[1:13:55] it'll be the same as the first right so
[1:13:58] what kind of birthing are we looking for
[1:14:00] oh well it's got to be 50 days it
[1:14:01] doesn't say
[1:14:04] that he said you pray for the
[1:14:07] Dynamics he said the Dy Dynamics is
[1:14:09] nothing but a refilling of the Holy
[1:14:11] Ghost while The Headstone is coming down
[1:14:14] he said we've worked in a small measure
[1:14:15] while The Headstone is coming
[1:14:19] down
[1:14:23] Hallelujah almost
[1:14:28] let's see in the breach again he said he
[1:14:31] said John hadn't noticed this land
[1:14:33] before you know here he hadn't been
[1:14:35] mentioned before nowhere had it been
[1:14:36] mentioned joh didn't John didn't see it
[1:14:38] all over the heavens as he's looking but
[1:14:40] here come forth notice where it came
[1:14:42] forth where did it come from it come
[1:14:45] from the father's Throne where he had
[1:14:47] been seated since he had been slain and
[1:14:49] raised again he raised up and sat on the
[1:14:52] right hand of God ever living to make
[1:14:54] intercessions amen raised there today as
[1:14:58] an intercessor with his own blood to
[1:15:01] make intercession upon the ignorance of
[1:15:04] the people sir anybody got some
[1:15:11] ignorance oh his blood took care of
[1:15:15] that don't you see Hallelujah that's why
[1:15:19] I'm hitting Unity with this
[1:15:22] because we are all a word work in God we
[1:15:27] all have different issues some have
[1:15:28] issues with pride some have issues with
[1:15:30] being too fearful others others will
[1:15:32] have uh uh issues with narcissism
[1:15:35] another will have issues with uh with
[1:15:38] with being uh so isolated that they that
[1:15:41] they're they're
[1:15:42] suicidal
[1:15:46] right but we still have the same God
[1:15:48] that can do away with all of
[1:15:50] it don't you understand God made you not
[1:15:54] to not to be miserable not to be
[1:15:56] suffering he made you to be delivered
[1:15:58] amen he made you to watch to learn how
[1:16:02] to have a confidence in The God Who is
[1:16:05] literally right there right now watching
[1:16:08] what you want during this service caring
[1:16:11] for what your thought is caring for what
[1:16:13] your need is wanting to interact but
[1:16:17] only asking you to believe
[1:16:21] amen believe what his blood is right
[1:16:25] there take in your place and what it
[1:16:28] will do everything the blood said it
[1:16:30] would do
[1:16:32] hallelujah
[1:16:35] hallelujah let's jump down he says isn't
[1:16:37] it strange a simple lamb had to take our
[1:16:39] place and he saw the lamb he preceded
[1:16:41] out John hadn't saw him because he had
[1:16:43] been way back in the
[1:16:45] eternities even making intercession and
[1:16:48] showing that those who had come to God
[1:16:51] under the offering of the blood of blls
[1:16:53] and of goats and substitution offering
[1:16:55] he he also caused them who believed it
[1:16:58] pointed to him and the blood had not
[1:17:01] been shed yet so he was there to clear
[1:17:06] them he was there to clear you and
[1:17:11] I
[1:17:13] Hallelujah his Gathering of the people
[1:17:15] unto him think about it the very ones
[1:17:19] that could say son stand still under the
[1:17:22] sacrifice of a of the blood of a goat
[1:17:27] yes so if a goat's blood would do that
[1:17:30] because it was sinless what would the
[1:17:32] Lamb's blood do God's
[1:17:36] blood see brother sister there's there's
[1:17:38] a disconnect in our Revelation with this
[1:17:40] blood and what it does this Blood was
[1:17:43] actually to bring you back to communion
[1:17:44] with God this Blood was actually shed to
[1:17:48] to not make you just get by it was made
[1:17:51] to put you as an overcomer Hallelujah
[1:17:54] Glory to what his blood destroyed the
[1:17:57] works of the
[1:17:58] devil it destroyed them no wonder
[1:18:02] brother brandom could come to a place
[1:18:03] and say Satan is nothing but a
[1:18:07] bluff he has no
[1:18:10] power he's just fooling your
[1:18:16] mind Hallelujah I hope it's all right
[1:18:19] but we just had a testimony from the
[1:18:20] church and they were going through all
[1:18:23] these problems and and you know what
[1:18:26] they went to the doctor they did all the
[1:18:28] scans nothing then they had to go do
[1:18:31] they did MRI and then they had to go
[1:18:32] back and do cast canans and the whole
[1:18:34] time they're in this excruciating pain
[1:18:37] excruciating just just messed
[1:18:43] up and then when the results came back
[1:18:45] from the CAT scan the doctor said I I
[1:18:48] don't you know or the nurse said the
[1:18:49] nurse give the information said said I
[1:18:51] don't know what to tell you there's
[1:18:52] nothing wrong with you
[1:18:55] and he said he had just had a family
[1:18:57] member come
[1:18:59] by and make a
[1:19:02] comment about uh oh God have
[1:19:05] mercy ah his son his son made a made a
[1:19:09] comment about whatever but uh I'm not
[1:19:11] going to remember it but anyway that a
[1:19:13] thought came to him and said maybe it's
[1:19:16] just that spiritual oppression that
[1:19:17] you're living
[1:19:22] under he he was it it was it was a it
[1:19:26] was a nervous condition right and so he
[1:19:30] said he said you know what nothing's
[1:19:32] wrong with
[1:19:34] me and so he's just like well praise the
[1:19:37] Lord there's nothing wrong with
[1:19:39] me Lord your blood your and what within
[1:19:42] just a couple days everything went away
[1:19:45] hallah but think about
[1:19:48] it they were just dealing with it
[1:19:51] because of the State of Mind the devil
[1:19:54] was putting them in well you have to
[1:19:56] suffer yep yep there is 15 things wrong
[1:19:58] with you yep web WebMD is
[1:20:02] right right you know they never point
[1:20:04] you to the Natural ones they they point
[1:20:07] you to the one you got a headache and
[1:20:08] it's going it's going to be 880,000 hits
[1:20:11] and Pages you got everything no wonder
[1:20:14] people die after that they believe that
[1:20:17] you believe it but if you don't believe
[1:20:19] it then what can what can stop
[1:20:23] you because what you actually say you're
[1:20:25] believing in them I'm believing on a
[1:20:28] lamb that I believe has ordained me for
[1:20:31] a Rapture
[1:20:32] amen he is standing there with his blood
[1:20:35] right now making intercession for my
[1:20:41] unbelief return to
[1:20:46] cender Hallelujah Romans 8:34 almost
[1:20:49] done he who is he that condemneth it is
[1:20:52] Christ that died yay rather that is
[1:20:53] risen again who is even at the right
[1:20:55] hand of God who also maketh intercession
[1:20:58] for us remember that don't mean he's
[1:20:59] sitting at the right hand that's a power
[1:21:01] and authority yes Jesus is at the power
[1:21:06] and authority of God the same God that
[1:21:10] created this world to make intercession
[1:21:12] for you
[1:21:15] hallelujah
[1:21:19] hallelujah he said now watch close this
[1:21:21] is something you must get now he had
[1:21:23] been doing his mediator work making
[1:21:24] intercessions for the believer for 2,000
[1:21:26] years he had been uh he had been back
[1:21:29] there a lamb he stepping forth from
[1:21:30] eternity to take the title be break the
[1:21:32] seals reveal the Mysteries wi of it at
[1:21:34] the end time do you get it all right
[1:21:36] we'll go on then I love this all the
[1:21:39] Mysteries lays in these Seven Seals I
[1:21:42] got things opening up to me I am super
[1:21:44] excited about God help me because I'm on
[1:21:46] the way but Hebrews 7:22 says by so much
[1:21:50] was Jesus made assurity of a better
[1:21:52] Testament and they truly were many
[1:21:55] priests because they were not suffered
[1:21:57] to continue by reason of death but this
[1:22:00] man because he continueth ever hath an
[1:22:02] unchangeable priesthood where wherefore
[1:22:05] he is able also to save save to the them
[1:22:09] to the uttermost that come unto God by
[1:22:11] him seeing he ever liveth to make
[1:22:14] intercession for them
[1:22:17] Hallelujah he ever that's why he's
[1:22:19] living right now to make intercession
[1:22:22] for your needs to stand between between
[1:22:24] you and your problem and to make it
[1:22:27] right with God that's
[1:22:31] right oh
[1:22:35] Hallelujah I'm GNA close I got to
[1:22:38] close if I if I know I'm I moved in the
[1:22:40] restroom time I got to
[1:22:43] go
[1:22:44] Hallelujah I'm Not
[1:22:48] Innocent especially after a good old
[1:22:51] CAO
[1:22:53] Hallelujah all right fifth seal look he
[1:22:56] says notice now that if there's no altar
[1:22:58] of of sacrifice in heaven where is a
[1:23:01] sacrifice for sin L then the lamb there
[1:23:03] has to be a place where that slain lamb
[1:23:06] bloody is laying there where the blood
[1:23:07] is now the incense was the odor uh
[1:23:10] odorous stuff that they burn which the
[1:23:13] Bible said was the prayers of the Saints
[1:23:15] if there isn't No sacrifice on the altar
[1:23:18] then the prayers cannot be
[1:23:20] received it's only by the blood on the
[1:23:23] sacrificial altar that let the prayers
[1:23:26] go through to God so where you where are
[1:23:31] your prayers
[1:23:33] going see that's why Satan doesn't want
[1:23:35] you to pray that's why he wants to stop
[1:23:39] you from constantly being in
[1:23:41] prayer when the scripture said pray
[1:23:44] unceasing yeah he don't like that
[1:23:46] scripture at all because that type of
[1:23:48] connection with god with Revelation when
[1:23:50] you apply the token on
[1:23:53] that Hallelujah he's right there
[1:23:56] Hallelujah to answer my prayers to see
[1:24:00] my
[1:24:03] needs Hallelujah let's see where we're
[1:24:06] at let's close Hebrews 4:14 seeing then
[1:24:10] that we have a great high priest that is
[1:24:11] passed into the heavens Jesus the son of
[1:24:13] God let us hold fast our profession for
[1:24:16] we have not a high priest which cannot
[1:24:18] be touched with the feeling of our
[1:24:20] infirmities but was in all points
[1:24:22] tempted like as we are yet yet without
[1:24:24] sin Let Us therefore come boldly unto
[1:24:27] the throne of grace that we may obtain
[1:24:29] mercy and find Grace to help in time of
[1:24:34] need so what's your qualification
[1:24:37] where's Christ at right now he's in the
[1:24:39] Temple of Heaven now brother Bram says
[1:24:41] it in a lot of different ways your
[1:24:42] pastor could probably tell you but in
[1:24:44] some places he said that the altar was
[1:24:45] laying right behind the throne some plac
[1:24:48] he said it's right out of the throne I
[1:24:50] don't fully
[1:24:52] know but I know it's there am and I know
[1:24:55] that blood's
[1:25:00] applied let's
[1:25:11] stand so brother
[1:25:13] cam what are you trying to get to us I
[1:25:18] hope you can catch
[1:25:20] this when you have a revelation that
[1:25:24] Christ is not
[1:25:26] dead when you have a
[1:25:30] revelation that he's well I can't see
[1:25:33] him or maybe he hasn't talked to me
[1:25:36] maybe
[1:25:36] the Satan likes to keep us
[1:25:40] isolated from God that's that's his
[1:25:42] that's his whole game plan because if he
[1:25:45] can keep you isolated from
[1:25:47] God especially to a living God who's
[1:25:51] closer to you than you even imagine
[1:25:57] not only is he there but he's he's
[1:26:00] living for the purpose to hear your
[1:26:04] prayer he's living for the purpose to
[1:26:06] answer your prayer he
[1:26:09] cares the same way he's always
[1:26:14] cared this message was sent in this hour
[1:26:19] to reveal to
[1:26:22] us what God is actually doing right now
[1:26:24] for
[1:26:25] usah so that we wouldn't have to wonder
[1:26:28] about it
[1:26:30] hallelujah hallelujah you have to worry
[1:26:32] about it you g say well maybe maybe he
[1:26:35] loves me see he's at the mercy seat
[1:26:38] right now what's it
[1:26:40] called you said you said Mercy
[1:26:42] absolutely you know it's one of my
[1:26:43] favorite words I live by it it's the
[1:26:45] only thing I can present to God the need
[1:26:47] for Mercy Hallelujah you know what when
[1:26:50] I fall you know what I do I ask for
[1:26:52] Mercy you know what I what I do when I
[1:26:54] fall after that ask for
[1:26:56] Mercy I found it pretty handy that he
[1:27:00] named the seat of the application of the
[1:27:02] blood The Mercy
[1:27:06] Seat the Bible says he delighteth in
[1:27:10] Mercy it is his pleasure that his blood
[1:27:14] was shed and placed there because you
[1:27:18] were constantly in need of
[1:27:22] mercy so if that blood has been applied
[1:27:25] and stands in your gap for you what does
[1:27:27] that make possible right
[1:27:30] now it makes possible another pouring
[1:27:33] out it makes possible a healing it makes
[1:27:37] possible a closer walk with
[1:27:40] God hallelujah because I'm not just
[1:27:43] preaching
[1:27:45] something this is what his word
[1:27:48] says this is his desire that you might
[1:27:52] know these things that you could be
[1:27:54] purified and stand spotless as the Bride
[1:27:56] of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah it's so
[1:28:01] simple brother and sister but if we were
[1:28:04] to be
[1:28:05] honest is it living
[1:28:12] out how many are in the spot I'm I'm
[1:28:15] right there myself you know what I don't
[1:28:18] want to have a different type of Holy
[1:28:20] Ghost I don't I don't I don't want to
[1:28:23] have uh you know just some sort of
[1:28:25] message holy ghost or something like
[1:28:28] that I want to
[1:28:31] have the Bible Holy Ghost Hallelujah you
[1:28:35] know one thing that makes the book of
