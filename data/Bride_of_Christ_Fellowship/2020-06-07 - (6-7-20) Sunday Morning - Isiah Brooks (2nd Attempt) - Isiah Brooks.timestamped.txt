[6:25] selections especially the one
[6:30] Smith family song
[6:33] it take a lot of courage to get up
[6:37] before an audience
[6:38] especially when you're young I
[6:43] appreciate everything that was done
[6:47] we enjoyed your selection as well
[6:50] brother
[6:52] we appreciate that all the
[6:56] praise and worship that is gone before
[6:58] the Lord I
[7:00] praise God for the message last night uh
[7:04] I don't know about y'all but I'm still
[7:07] on fire
[7:10] you know hey ma it's cold sometimes with
[7:15] the air conditioning but it doesn't cook
[7:16] it doesn't chill the inside that's right
[7:20] we preached by God's grace as I said I'm
[7:23] a little hoarse but we're gonna scream
[7:25] it out again
[7:26] we preached on
[7:28] Friday hearing the voice of the
[7:31] scripture and we're going to minister
[7:35] that again what we're trying to take
[7:38] another part of a portion of it I have
[7:42] been
[7:43] working on this for some time
[7:47] it was a revelation that God gave me and
[7:50] I trust that you'll be able to see that
[7:54] what God is doing in this last day yes
[7:57] as we have you stand let us turn to the
[8:01] scripture according to Matthew 17 we
[8:04] read the 18th through the 20th verse and
[8:07] being then we'll really go down to
[8:09] Philippians of 1:1 is 6
[8:15] and from there we'll go to Luke 11:1
[8:21] you love the Lord I
[8:24] am somewhat a crybaby
[8:28] especially when I feel the presence of
[8:30] the Lord I
[8:33] can't help myself
[8:36] and if what I could even if I could I
[8:38] wouldn't I
[8:41] enjoy Jesus
[8:44] hallelujah Matthew 17
[8:49] everybody there
[8:52] we're going to be starting at the 18th
[8:54] verse
[8:59] appreciate my son being here with his
[9:01] family
[9:03] we enjoyed him last night by God's
[9:06] graces I trust that the Lord will bless
[9:08] him as well and everybody else tonight
[9:12] or this morning Matthew 17 18 292 the
[9:17] 20th verse and Jesus rebuked the devil
[9:20] and he departed out of him and the child
[9:24] was cured from that very hour
[9:28] then came the disciples of Jesus apart
[9:32] and said why could we not cast him out
[9:36] and Jesus said unto him because of your
[9:40] unbelief
[9:42] for bearly I said to you if you have
[9:45] faith as a grain of mustard seed you
[9:50] shall say unto this mountain remove
[9:53] hence to yonder place and it shall
[9:57] remove and nothing shall be impossible
[10:00] unto you now I want to really emphasize
[10:03] that last portion nothing shall be
[10:06] impossible
[10:08] unto you all right let's go to
[10:11] Philippians 1:6
[10:12] you love the Lord
[10:17] so when I cry I have a little running
[10:20] but I think
[10:22] I'm gonna be real with family
[10:28] we don't have any sophisticated folks up
[10:31] again
[10:35] Philippians 1:6 being confident of this
[10:38] very thing that
[10:40] he which have begun a good work in you
[10:43] will
[10:43] perform it until the day of Jesus Christ
[10:48] I want to say to everyone that felt God
[10:52] and knew he was here last night he
[10:54] started something
[10:55] one thing about the Lord Jesus whatever
[10:58] he starts he finishes
[11:00] and the thing I love about my Lord he's
[11:03] a perfectionist
[11:04] [Laughter]
[11:06] he leaves nothing undone
[11:09] Luke 11:1 excuse me that I say that a
[11:13] mini 11:1 Luke 11:1
[11:21] and it came to pass I love that saying
[11:26] and it came to pass
[11:28] yes that as he was praying in a certain
[11:32] place
[11:33] when he ceased one of his disciples said
[11:36] unto Him Lord teach us to pray and John
[11:41] also taught his two cents on also taught
[11:44] his disciples and he said unto them when
[11:48] you pray say this is what I love he
[11:50] didn't say my father he said our Father
[11:53] which art in heaven hallowed be thy name
[11:57] thy kingdom come thy will be done in
[12:02] earth as it is in heaven see I like that
[12:05] that means I can shower I can dance I
[12:09] can run I can live holy yes because
[12:14] that's the way they do it in heaven
[12:19] in other words he says pray that you
[12:23] bring heaven down to earth
[12:27] act like you them in heaven I don't know
[12:30] about you but I've been translated
[12:36] explain that in just a moment you say
[12:38] what do you mean brother I'm now sitting
[12:39] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus yes
[12:41] and some of us won't even believe that
[12:44] but let me say it like this even when it
[12:48] came to Einstein he actually believed in
[12:52] revit relativity he understood that you
[12:55] could be in two places at one time and
[12:57] Jesus said explain to me how the Son of
[13:01] Man stand here on earth and is in heaven
[13:04] too
[13:05] right you don't understand but those of
[13:08] us who have theophanies we in heaven
[13:14] so if I'm already damned I'm already
[13:17] there
[13:20] amen we're gonna go on with it give us
[13:23] this day our daily bread
[13:26] you know I think about that and I think
[13:30] about it's only in this age we have been
[13:33] able to have daily bread
[13:35] all of the ages
[13:37] except for Paul's age
[13:40] they couldn't have it they didn't have
[13:43] it they lost the word they had a portion
[13:46] of the word but in this day God gave us
[13:49] the full law
[13:51] and forgive us of our sins for we also
[13:54] forgive everyone that is gathered unto
[13:57] us
[13:58] and lead us not into temptation but
[14:02] deliver us from evil
[14:05] let us pray
[14:07] father God we come before you right now
[14:11] in your name help us Lord i bind every
[14:16] spirit here that's not like the Lord
[14:18] Jesus I know there are those who are
[14:20] tired some that are weary but I pray
[14:23] father God that by your grace and your
[14:25] mercy age that you would touch them give
[14:27] them energy and give them strength in
[14:29] your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray
[14:32] amen the harder you pull the quicker we
[14:35] get out of here if you pull in slow
[14:38] motion i'ma move in slow motion
[14:41] you may be seated I
[14:48] like to explain and of course many of us
[14:52] we know these things but I just want to
[14:55] kind of lay something out for those of
[14:58] us who have been
[14:59] sanctified justified and sanctified and
[15:03] fear with the Holy Ghost
[15:05] we are a different kind of a people
[15:09] we are a faith generation
[15:13] see even though we be Abraham's seed it
[15:16] is not by the natural man that's right
[15:19] it's only by faith
[15:23] Abraham who represented God was the
[15:26] father of faith and God toy for him that
[15:30] he was going to have seeds a man that
[15:33] will be in such a a multiplication of it
[15:37] that it will it would be like the stars
[15:39] of heaven and the dust of the earth
[15:43] look at Abraham's seed in the natural
[15:45] none of them could produce the promised
[15:48] son
[15:49] none of them
[15:52] as good as they lived
[15:56] no matter how they communicated with God
[15:59] they all failed
[16:01] they came short of the glory of God so
[16:05] Abraham C could not come into his
[16:08] position by way of the flesh
[16:11] it only could come into position by the
[16:14] weight of promise I love God because God
[16:18] keeps all of his promises
[16:21] no flesh could produce a perfect son
[16:25] hello so let me say it like this your
[16:28] flesh I don't care how well you think
[16:32] you are how good you think you are how
[16:36] perfect you think you are you are not
[16:39] perfect in your flesh you
[16:41] and I were born sinners brother Branham
[16:45] said we were born failures to begin with
[16:49] hallelujah so we need something more
[16:52] than a flesh
[16:54] right because the Bible says no flesh
[16:57] and blood shall enter into the kingdom
[17:01] now we're not that used to just get me
[17:04] like okay I'm going in the rapture how
[17:06] I'm gonna get there if I'm not going by
[17:08] flesh it's a different slash
[17:12] hallelujah because in heaven you don't
[17:16] need blood the only blood you ever
[17:19] needed in heaven was put on the altar
[17:21] and that's the blood of Jesus Christ
[17:24] hallelujah
[17:25] in heaven you don't need breath you
[17:28] don't know that you're not breathing in
[17:30] heaven you're living
[17:33] the breath of the breath of life was
[17:36] only given to this dimension
[17:39] that's why the ages in heaven can hold a
[17:42] note without breathing
[17:47] hallelujah
[17:48] you've got to realize Amen that there's
[17:51] another body we must have take you to
[17:55] into that city you
[17:56] [Music]
[17:58] and I must understand that in order for
[18:01] us to come into this promise that God is
[18:06] for us we must have to say
[18:09] yes
[18:10] is that right
[18:12] see let me say it like this faith in
[18:15] what all of the word not some of it all
[18:19] of it
[18:21] and so so did you understand that when
[18:26] we come in this day this is why God left
[18:30] us
[18:33] without a physical man to lean on
[18:38] hello remember in the Garden of Eden oh
[18:42] they had was a voice
[18:46] and God worded it just like that
[18:50] the voice of God walked in the cool of
[18:53] the evening he could have described it
[18:56] some other way but he wanted to
[18:58] emphasize the vows because he's the
[19:00] Alpha and the Omega if he's a voice in
[19:03] the beginning he's a voice in here
[19:07] and you and I must understand that if
[19:11] Eve would have only obeyed the voice
[19:14] that's right not used her reasoning we
[19:18] would have never been up falling people
[19:20] right but because of her reasoning yes
[19:24] she disobeyed the boy device
[19:27] now you got to understand this
[19:29] fellowship with the voice the voice
[19:32] talked to them right there in the Garden
[19:36] of Eden
[19:37] we know who the voice he is
[19:40] hallelujah they talked with the Tree of
[19:43] Life
[19:44] [Music]
[19:45] hallelujah T it wasn't only the slurpin
[19:49] that who could talk it was the Tree of
[19:52] Life with the dog
[19:54] but we know wouldn't you like is
[19:57] hallelujah here's a voice of the
[20:00] scripture so that you could understand
[20:02] and we know these things but I'm just
[20:04] trying to give a prelude to what I'm
[20:05] trying to get to Laurie
[20:07] but there was no space and time
[20:11] there was God we know him as Elohim
[20:15] Elohim had thoughts of himself and in
[20:20] those thoughts he produce what we call
[20:22] words
[20:24] see we don't even think that words were
[20:26] thought but words were thoughts and God
[20:30] produced the word and he spoke the word
[20:34] hallelujah from that thought came a word
[20:37] and we realized the first word he said
[20:40] was what
[20:42] I'm sorry I said I didn't mean to set
[20:45] you up
[20:46] that's all right
[20:48] the first word he's saying what's Jesus
[20:54] he said well why you would say that
[20:57] because in the mind of God
[20:59] he had already slain
[21:02] the Lamb
[21:06] that's why Mary couldn't name him that's
[21:10] why
[21:11] Joseph couldn't Mamie
[21:15] Jesus had to name him we didn't know his
[21:19] name we only knew him as a word of God
[21:22] John said in the beginning was the word
[21:24] the Word was with God and the Word was
[21:25] God that same word created everything
[21:29] and nothing was made without his medium
[21:32] is that right what was it it was God in
[21:35] warfare is that right you said why would
[21:39] his name be Jesus because the angel said
[21:41] he came and his father's
[21:46] name was a redemptive name
[21:49] that's why I was trying to tell
[21:51] everybody last night that your name was
[21:54] put on the Lamb's Book of Life before
[21:56] the foundation you learn not only was
[21:58] her name click there but you were saved
[22:00] you see and you want your delivered
[22:04] right
[22:09] can I say it like this
[22:11] God is I am
[22:15] so when I am is present God there is no
[22:20] evolution
[22:22] come on there is no evolving in God's
[22:27] mind he is and so are you oh
[22:31] come on summer but the fall because of
[22:36] it place us in what we call a time loop
[22:41] and you understand what time is time is
[22:45] given to us by God so that we won't
[22:48] receive everything at one time
[22:51] [Laughter]
[22:54] you see I'm saying he could've did all
[22:57] of this and say we
[22:59] put it all together and you and I would
[23:03] not have learned anything
[23:06] but he put us in time to know of him
[23:10] don't you understand the practice of God
[23:14] he wanted you to understand how much he
[23:17] loves you
[23:19] because the book is all about
[23:25] now
[23:27] I want you to understand that if you are
[23:31] thought in the mind of God and it is
[23:34] mine you were bribed nothing can take
[23:37] that away from you
[23:39] that right Paul said it like this what
[23:42] ahoo just separate me separate us from
[23:46] the love of God hallelujah nothing can
[23:49] separate us
[23:53] now we know by God's grace God sent us a
[23:58] prophet and we understand by God's grace
[24:01] that he was the man that could turn on
[24:04] the light
[24:06] cuz we had no idea on what the
[24:09] scriptures meant
[24:13] but it was his ministry not the man's
[24:16] physical but it was God is the man
[24:19] turning on the light is that right let
[24:23] me give you an example
[24:24] he was Abraham
[24:26] sitting out there in the cool of the
[24:29] evening right and a voice showed up
[24:34] as three men
[24:37] hallelujah and his voice said to himself
[24:40] listen shall I hide from Abraham
[24:44] what's about to happen
[24:47] you see what I'm saying that's a voice
[24:50] of
[25:07] Noah so shall the Son of Man be revealed
[25:10] because he's the saying he cannot change
[25:13] and God revealed what was going to
[25:17] happen to Abraham he must do the same to
[25:20] Abraham
[25:22] [Applause]
[25:26] this was given just prior to
[25:32] the burning of Sodom
[25:35] yes sir
[25:38] so if God sent a messenger to open our
[25:42] eyes
[25:44] that messenger had to come at a time
[25:47] when Sodom was about to burn
[25:55] see so you gotta realize that we the
[25:58] condition that we are in right now
[26:01] as we are in the condition of the world
[26:04] being destroyed
[26:05] by God
[26:08] and if if you've got there's an Abraham
[26:12] at the time of Sodom there must be a
[26:14] Abraham's seed
[26:16] y'all see them saying I'm trying to get
[26:19] you to see this cuz all of ours is just
[26:21] to begin me
[26:23] God's trying to get your attention
[26:29] understand too that
[26:32] in this condition in this agent we're
[26:35] living in your time my time is a time
[26:38] for the changing of the body
[26:42] because God was getting to this
[26:48] he was
[26:51] [Music]
[27:17] understanding neighbor Hamm's time there
[27:20] was a lot of distractions
[27:22] every time God told me for him to do
[27:25] something Abraham did just the opposite
[27:29] counted for me to you
[27:32] Abraham had the influence right of the
[27:36] various cities around
[27:38] and she that's problem we have the
[27:41] influence of cities
[27:43] working with us now that's why we can't
[27:46] focus on the very call that God has
[27:50] called us to God brought Abraham out of
[27:54] Babylon he did not intend from Abraham
[27:57] to go back to Beit Babylon but did not
[28:00] Abraham do it
[28:03] hallelujah he even went down amen and
[28:08] another king by the name of Abimelech
[28:12] and at that time
[28:27] [Applause]
[28:47] no y'all remember Noah don't you know
[28:52] was a
[28:53] simple man but in his day science ruled
[28:59] come on it's a joke and no one looks
[29:03] stupid cause he didn't wanna I pad and
[29:07] iPhone and I something
[29:10] he was just a little farmer
[29:14] he was believing God
[29:17] you see he was outside of the city can I
[29:21] say like that that's right because
[29:23] brother man said he'd built that on the
[29:25] top of a mountain what an inspiration
[29:29] nah you know where your Ark is built on
[29:32] top of the mountain
[29:35] so you and I must understand hallelujah
[29:39] that in his day he was simple he was
[29:43] different from the modern Christians
[29:46] hallelujah but he was at that time God
[29:50] gave him a message that was almost
[29:52] impossible to believe
[29:55] it's going to rain
[29:58] it had never rained before
[30:01] fire is gonna fall
[30:04] fire has never fallen before not all
[30:07] over the whole Wow you see why were you
[30:10] saying that brother so did you
[30:11] understand that's why the Corolla has
[30:13] hit every nation there is because God
[30:16] has judged the whole world and this
[30:18] power
[30:19] could be will be blasted with the fire
[30:22] of God
[30:25] hallelujah living in a time where
[30:28] everything that seems to look normal
[30:30] it's not it's abnormal
[30:34] went from a different city we're from a
[30:37] different country and listen God has
[30:40] made a way for us to hear the voice is
[30:43] that right remember when God brought
[30:45] Egypt Israel out of Egypt took him to
[30:48] Mount Sinai and God began to speak with
[30:50] the people the Bible said the earth
[30:53] shook the mountains shocked the smoke
[30:57] came down the fire went up and the
[30:59] people got scared shut up help me Lord
[31:03] you understand me oh
[31:04] don't let him preach like that no mom
[31:07] I'd only hear the voice of God like that
[31:10] hallelujah
[31:12] and from that to know God brought forth
[31:16] prophets
[31:18] who would have the voice of God
[31:21] is that right who would have
[31:25] listened because without a vision the
[31:29] people perish
[31:31] to an order to be saved in this day
[31:35] you've got to have a vision it can't be
[31:38] y'all it's gotta be a gosh
[31:42] hallelujah so in this time where you got
[31:46] to hear the voice and you know what
[31:47] people let me tell y'all something a lot
[31:50] of time you know when we say hear the
[31:51] voice everybody Minds go to brother
[31:54] Branham but you know brother Branham
[31:56] voice
[31:57] has been used
[31:59] it's on tape with the voice of God
[32:03] Young's to me because it's a voice in a
[32:05] voice you understand me but the voice
[32:09] must continue
[32:11] because when he lied to with off the
[32:14] scene Elijah had to carry the same
[32:17] message that Elijah had
[32:23] I get to in just a moment I just wanna
[32:27] jump I'm excited so I get it I may jump
[32:31] this we were born with the wrong mind we
[32:35] were born with the mind of the world
[32:38] and that's how we you know when you're
[32:39] not born against when you still love
[32:41] things of the world because the Bible
[32:43] tells us if the love if you love the
[32:45] things of the world the love of God is
[32:46] not in you hallelujah it doesn't mean
[32:50] that you're not predestinated to be
[32:53] bride
[32:55] because even Abraham was the chosen of
[32:58] God and he back slid you say he did not
[33:01] say he did in a man that would give his
[33:04] wife to another man to save his own self
[33:08] himself it's backslidden
[33:13] something's wrong with me oh
[33:16] come on is that right that's what the
[33:18] problem the God said he said that's what
[33:20] I love the Bible he tells the good and
[33:22] the bad
[33:25] and there was a father of faith
[33:28] but he'd made a lot of mistakes and I
[33:33] could truly say that the best thing that
[33:34] Abraham ever did was that he offered up
[33:38] Isaac
[33:39] hallelujah now i'ma tell you like this
[33:41] let this mind be in you hey y'all look
[33:45] at the thing when Abraham did when he
[33:46] offered a vows like it's something just
[33:47] karma well I don't heard this before and
[33:49] get on to something else
[33:51] [Laughter]
[33:54] hallelujah how many times y'all eat
[33:56] Syria the same Syria every day
[34:00] come on do y'all say come on Syria I
[34:03] want something different yeah you don't
[34:04] want me but anyway by God's grace let me
[34:07] hurry
[34:08] when we look at the Bible and that's
[34:10] what don't ever let this message become
[34:13] common to you you are dangerous grounds
[34:15] if the message become common to you you
[34:19] are in dangerous grounds you're like the
[34:21] children of Israel the manna got can't
[34:24] became common and when the matter became
[34:28] calm became common they began to
[34:30] complain and murmur
[34:33] y'all hear what I'm saying listen let me
[34:36] tell you like this if you steal exalting
[34:38] creatures to be great there is no great
[34:41] preacher
[34:42] you might as well be like a denomination
[34:45] and the organization right because
[34:47] whenever a man sheep define a name he's
[34:52] under the spirit of Babylon
[34:54] is that right because Babylon in the
[34:58] beginning said let us go make ourselves
[35:00] a name
[35:02] but if you are the seed of Abraham God
[35:06] told Abraham I'm gonna make you a name
[35:10] but it wasn't Abraham making himself a
[35:13] name it was God giving Abraham a name
[35:16] understand the difference
[35:21] he never went to make himself a name but
[35:25] God made him a name
[35:27] so let me move on it so I said this last
[35:31] week of Friday your head is not the
[35:35] temple
[35:36] the temple of God is in your heart it's
[35:40] in your soul
[35:42] hallelujah so God says stop thinking
[35:45] with the head and start thinking with
[35:48] your heart
[35:49] let this mind be in you which was also
[35:53] in Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[35:56] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[35:58] with God but made of himself no
[36:02] reputation and took upon him the form of
[36:05] a servant and was made in the likeness
[36:07] of men hallelujah now you say what do
[36:11] you mean Brotherhood see you gotta
[36:12] understand that God didn't call you Oh
[36:16] sister brother Amen just to be common in
[36:19] the sense that oh I'm just a brother I'm
[36:23] just a man I'm just a woman Oh
[36:25] hallelujah because God is supernatural
[36:28] right and when you have been born again
[36:31] you're no longer just a man that's right
[36:34] you're no longer just oh
[36:36] you have become a supernatural being
[36:42] so is he if you think you just
[36:45] flesh-and-blood that's all you're going
[36:47] to be but when you know that you know
[36:50] that you know that you got God on the
[36:52] inside it changes your disposition it
[36:55] changes a way of thinking and your way
[36:58] of and what happens if all things become
[37:02] possible
[37:04] I believe that the Bible says know you
[37:08] not that you're the temple of God and
[37:10] that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you
[37:13] now Paul said if you don't know that
[37:15] you're reprobate right if you don't know
[37:19] that God is in you something has changed
[37:21] you somewhere you're allowing Satan to
[37:25] deform you at the same time that God is
[37:29] trying to transform you
[37:33] the temple of God him shall God destroy
[37:36] but the temple of God is holy which
[37:39] temple ye are
[37:42] this is what I was trying to tell the
[37:44] people the other day I said we're no
[37:46] longer in the day where the God will
[37:50] allow us to eat off of the tree of
[37:52] knowledge of good and evil
[37:55] we eaten off of it but he said listen
[37:59] you either make the tree good or you
[38:02] make it he separated it Oh hallelujah
[38:08] he understood that was a tree and here's
[38:12] a treat of knowledge and good and evil
[38:14] but that's for the wire
[38:16] but the tree of life eats only from the
[38:20] good tree which is the Tree of Life
[38:25] let me say you know just what I was
[38:27] saying yesterday I said you understand
[38:30] and people don't like this but I said
[38:32] anyway what happened when that rod got
[38:35] beyond the veil it buddy
[38:39] it blossomed and it brought forth
[38:43] almonds only the female can bring forth
[38:48] yes and God is trying to tell you
[38:52] something that
[38:53] he's placed you behind the veil
[38:57] though you are dead rod
[39:00] you were being used by God by Aaron by
[39:03] Moses and you didn't know who you were
[39:06] God was using you all along even when
[39:09] you didn't know you were
[39:12] pareidolia but he's not satisfied with
[39:15] that you've got to go beyond the veil
[39:18] [Applause]
[39:20] this is not a thing where you can say
[39:22] well please
[39:24] no you don't have a choice
[39:28] this is not a choice to stay outside of
[39:32] the veil with his death
[39:35] remember when Adam and Eve Smith the
[39:39] cherubim Seraphim whichever they were
[39:41] drove them out of the garden
[39:44] why because the Tree of Life was still
[39:46] there and he did not want them to live
[39:50] in that condition
[39:52] hallelujah but now the tree of life is
[39:56] saying to everyone whosoever will let
[40:00] them come
[40:04] okay I was read from the bottom
[40:16] but I'm gonna have a good time
[40:21] hallelujah this is the hour of the
[40:26] manifestations of the sons of God did
[40:29] y'all know that Oh like I said the other
[40:32] night that's why the world is falling
[40:34] apart
[40:37] because the sons of serpents that's
[40:40] right they don't have creative ability
[40:41] they don't have authority over nature
[40:44] that's why they get the dump trucks dig
[40:48] up the ground move the dirt Adam didn't
[40:51] have to do that
[40:54] sound of God is that right you said
[40:57] brothers that's not true yes it is jesus
[41:00] said if you say to the street
[41:03] move over yonder that we have to obey
[41:06] and so the whole of creation is waiting
[41:10] for the manifestation of the sons of
[41:13] what you want revival the
[41:17] revival but they cannot get in that
[41:20] position until you and I get into our
[41:25] nature want to work for you
[41:32] [Music]
[41:35] hallelujah ice storm was coming and I
[41:38] said no we want to have Church

[41:44] and speak to that stone hallelujah guess
[41:47] what the storm was coming our way it

[41:51] moved around us and you know what the
[41:55] newspaper said news people excuse me we

[42:19] that right he said I was he said that
[42:22] snowstorm was coming he said and I told
[42:24] those brothers go ahead of me hallelujah

[42:30] moved too late he said but the storm was
[42:32] steady coming and I will study walking
[42:34] in it hallelujah somebody help me here
[42:37] but all of a sudden he heard a voice
[42:41] and the boss said can I walk with you

[46:32] because he could see God God made that
[46:35] tree God made those birds to sing for me

[47:48] brushes your teeth you don't have to
[47:49] brush your teeth
[47:52] but their consequences
[48:01] that's all I'm saying you don't have to
[48:03] do nothing is that right but I enjoyed
[48:06] Jesus is that right
[48:08] so what do you brother Adam said it like
[48:10] this he said the old church never had to

[51:10] get discouraged no more
[51:12] because I realized by God's grace
[51:15] everybody it's not like they might be a
[51:17] Jacob
[51:19] but you know one thing about he saw he
[51:22] couldn't change
[51:23] that's right you can preach to him all
[51:26] day and he couldn't change
[51:28] but Jacob heard the message

[54:51] Bible brings the thing to pass wait a
[54:55] minute that's why you need Jesus

[1:01:01] God said let there be a world
[1:01:03] hallelujah
[1:01:06] before it could be a world it had to be
[1:01:09] a thought I'm on the 7177 I'm sorry so

[1:01:14] he starts first didn't spoke it and
[1:01:16] thought Express became material let me
[1:01:19] say this you might not believe it but
[1:01:20] this is my testimony one time I was
[1:01:23] sitting there at the Panera not here but
[1:01:25] in I was looking out the window and
[1:01:28] there was a little whirlwind with a
[1:01:30] piece of paper whirling around in it
[1:01:31] like that and something said to my mind
[1:01:33] speak to that whirlwind and caused it to
[1:01:35] do this I did and it did it say speak to
[1:01:39] it again I calls it I spoke to and said
[1:01:42] move here move there and did it and then
[1:01:44] there was a third time the God the Word
[1:01:46] of God huh I'm like I'm not even
[1:01:48] conscious God is talking I'm just
[1:01:50] thinking and I'm doing this right not
[1:01:53] neither God and then you know it says
[1:01:55] calls it to move in the opposition of
[1:01:57] the whirlwind in other words a man
[1:02:00] however the whirlwind is swinging it
[1:02:02] that make it go the opposite way I

[1:09:35] more even Romans the fourth chapter
[1:09:38] I don't mean to make it happen you know
[1:09:41] look at simple things that we miss out
[1:09:43] we miss out that's right don't we just
[1:09:47] open our mouths for things right
[1:09:49] growing with the fourth chapter
[1:09:51] beginning at the first verse what should
[1:09:53] I say then that Abraham our Father as
[1:09:55] pertaining to the flesh hath sound if
[1:09:58] Abraham was justified by works he had
[1:10:01] were up to glory but not before God she
[1:10:04] that's why God won't allow us did you
[1:10:07] understand in all of Abraham's ministry
[1:10:10] he never did one miracle
[1:10:14] he just believed God
[1:10:23] John the Baptist never did one miracle
[1:10:27] but because he had faith in what he
[1:10:30] believed in with regard himself his name
[1:10:33] is written in the Hall of Fame
[1:10:37] God will somebody to believe him
[1:10:45] are you gonna let my hair out do you oh
[1:10:50] right here
[1:10:52] in the city of Jericho believed that God
[1:10:57] had destroyed Egypt by way of Moses
[1:11:01] I think it may have been 40 years after
[1:11:05] then because the children Israel was in
[1:11:08] the wilderness for 40 years and seek out
[1:11:11] a second hand report and believe
[1:11:31] but she saw opportunity to get out of
[1:11:35] her condition
[1:11:36] [Applause]
[1:11:50] with Noah built the ark right but I
[1:11:54] believe I
[1:11:55] was a dad when Joshua thought a man
[1:11:59] against Jericho but I believe I
[1:12:02] wasn't there when they crucified Jesus I
[1:12:05] don't know what I'm saying there's a two
[1:12:07] side to that story I was there yet I
[1:12:09] wasn't y'all notice hallelujah but I
[1:12:12] wasn't there I believe it I know he was
[1:12:17] crucified for my singing I know there is
[1:12:19] no other God outside of Jesus I
[1:12:23] don't know how I know it other than it
[1:12:26] was revealed to me
[1:12:30] you know experiences travel in the DNA
[1:12:35] that's why brother I said I was there
[1:12:40] because he was in the DNA of Jesus
[1:12:42] Christ
[1:12:43] yummy so we got the whole eco
[1:12:47] [Applause]
[1:12:51] I didn't know when I was in him
[1:13:00] [Applause]
[1:13:03] but even ham was justified by works he
[1:13:05] went up to gory but not before God well
[1:13:09] for what say it the scripture abraham
[1:13:12] believed God and he counted unto him for
[1:13:14] righteousness now I want you to
[1:13:16] understand where he's going with this
[1:13:19] because some of us don't have the
[1:13:21] circumcision yet but God gave us the
[1:13:23] circumcision because we have faith in it
[1:13:24] right
[1:13:27] I said because you believe God is
[1:13:31] already accounted it
[1:13:33] [Applause]
[1:13:51] before he was circumcised
[1:13:53] [Applause]
[1:13:58] hallelujah but him that worketh is the
[1:14:00] reward not reckoned of grace but of debt
[1:14:03] but to him that worketh not but
[1:14:05] believeth on him that justifieth the
[1:14:08] ungodly his faith is counted for
[1:14:10] righteousness that's why I didn't want
[1:14:12] to work you last night like he was
[1:14:13] laboring but the Holy Ghost
[1:14:15] hallelujah you were laboring just to get
[1:14:18] into the spirit
[1:14:20] is that right Hebrews says labor to
[1:14:24] enter into his rest
[1:14:27] because we're so common minded we have
[1:14:30] to labor some time to get spiritual
[1:14:33] that's what I was doing and when you
[1:14:35] began to glorify God when you begin to
[1:14:37] praise God when you begin to thank God
[1:14:39] all of a sudden God inhabits the praise
[1:14:42] of his people
[1:14:43] [Applause]
[1:14:48] [Applause]
[1:14:59] the name of Jesus Jesus shows up
[1:15:08] hallelujah
[1:15:10] I love the name of Jesus did you know
[1:15:11] that
[1:15:12] you know why I love the name of Jesus
[1:15:15] because if I said all heaven and earth
[1:15:16] is named now so when I say Jesus all
[1:15:20] heavens yes Lord
[1:15:22] did you know that
[1:15:24] they call on us they turn for our rescue
[1:15:28] the host of that
[1:15:30] you don't believe it it's true
[1:15:32] it's true
[1:15:34] those ages went down says law have you
[1:15:37] seen what was going down on down there
[1:15:39] in Babylon he said I already see that
[1:15:41] I'm already waiting you know what I'm
[1:15:43] saying yes one of them says oh can I go
[1:15:46] down there wormwood should I turn this
[1:15:48] world upside down
[1:15:49] just give me one just give me just give
[1:15:51] me the permission Lord
[1:15:53] God says no no no no no this is mine I'm
[1:15:56] coming down right so I'm saying this so
[1:15:59] you can understand like this he said in
[1:16:02] this day it would be heated up seven
[1:16:05] times
[1:16:07] that means it was heated seven times
[1:16:10] hotter just like the Son of man came in
[1:16:13] that day he comes in this day and stands
[1:16:15] in the fire
[1:16:18] no no trial no tribulation can separate
[1:16:23] us from the love of God
[1:16:25] [Applause]
[1:16:43] from taking the translation
[1:16:53] whatever is fall make it bring it to
[1:16:56] perfection let it have its good work and
[1:17:00] let me wait on it till I can see it

[1:17:24] that was the scourge of God saved me

[1:17:29] man whom God will not impute sin yes
[1:17:32] I didn't even know this message at the
[1:17:34] time and then he took me to Psalms 103
[1:17:37] about the blessings see that's why I'm
[1:17:39] always blessed some people don't like it
[1:17:41] but I'm always better

[1:29:56] people will see and when they come by

[1:30:01] Abraham did no matter what a weird
[1:30:05] hallelujah is all right
[1:30:07] listen what the devil did he thought
[1:30:10] okay he saw there was an angelic
[1:30:12] visitation with Joseph with Mary excuse
[1:30:15] me so he he said oh I'm on North Joseph
[1:30:19] dang we'll let him see this one and she

[1:30:39] about the brothers
[1:30:41] it look like I've got crazy up here I
[1:30:45] mean he had to feel that way he felt
[1:30:49] like a man in a man
[1:30:51] but he loved us all he want to put away
[1:30:54] uh privately that was that he was going
[1:30:57] stoned her
[1:31:00] God had to intervene
[1:31:02] that was the devil's inspiration using
[1:31:05] the very scripture
[1:31:06] because all Mary had to do was slip -
[1:31:09] Isaiah's and a virgin shall conceive and
[1:31:11] I'm that virgin
[1:31:14] hallelujah but the devil had to be the
[1:31:17] prize phosphate
[1:31:21] God said not this one
[1:31:25] hallelujah he's escaped Helen
[1:31:32] he's escaped heaven and he's gonna
[1:31:35] escape you to Joseph I
[1:31:38] see tell them saying y'all don't
[1:31:40] understand how God protects us day by
[1:31:41] day by day by day evil is always around
[1:31:45] us and you and I don't have no idea what
[1:31:47] God is doing for you
[1:31:50] people scared of the Quran when all them
[1:31:52] other germs out there
[1:32:00] [Applause]
[1:32:18] I'm almost done brother I'm sorry I do
[1:32:22] talk too much but you gotta understand
[1:32:25] bringing down chuckles I'm really I'm
[1:32:26] bringing down the clothes so you
[1:32:27] understand what what's happening now you
[1:32:30] and I were with him in the Battle of
[1:32:32] Michael and Lucifer did y'all know that
[1:32:35] we were there we took crisis sighs we
[1:32:38] don't remember it but we did hallelujah
[1:32:41] and and because we stood with him then
[1:32:43] he's standing with us now
[1:32:46] because it was always God's will to talk
[1:32:50] toe-to-toe multiply and fill the earth
[1:32:53] with sons of God but because of the fall
[1:32:58] it broke the chain and the earth was
[1:33:02] filled with sons of
[1:33:04] Adam and when Adam sons died off this
[1:33:10] the earth was full of the sons of the
[1:33:13] serpent
[1:33:14] it was then God said I am going to
[1:33:18] destroy y'all hear me
[1:33:21] so as it was in that day so it is in
[1:33:25] this day
[1:33:27] the sons of God are few right
[1:33:31] small in number they put the population
[1:33:36] of the world other side puns
[1:33:39] and God says I am going to destroy the
[1:33:43] world again but what the devil didn't
[1:33:47] know that from the day of Pentecost God
[1:33:51] has been populating and
[1:33:55] collecting all his subjects for the new
[1:33:59] world
[1:34:00] [Applause]
[1:34:05] because babies hated by the fall
[1:34:09] there will not be the babies over there
[1:34:12] that's why we grow up into the statue of
[1:34:15] a perfect of a man every child that guy
[1:34:18] goes up and they become an adult before
[1:34:21] God you don't know that
[1:34:24] hallelujah shoot'em shame not packing us
[1:34:27] away the whole time
[1:34:30] but after the world is burnt over
[1:34:33] everybody every son and daughter that
[1:34:36] died in Christ come back
[1:34:39] the shopkins the bound four thousand

[1:35:58] let me tell you something before the
[1:36:00] fall I don't know what those vegetables

[1:37:06] know about that we remember when when
[1:37:08] when when Ella Hill came to visit
[1:37:10] Abraham he stepped into the dust he
[1:37:13] stepped into the dust he stepped into it
[1:37:16] and it was cold
[1:37:22] so Michael in his angel is over again
[1:37:25] America the spirit of a heaven and and
[1:37:27] Jezebel's the spirit of what
[1:37:29] hallelujah so America is allowing
[1:37:32] Jezebel to rule her that's what the
[1:37:34] whole situation is all about she's
[1:37:37] calling in her property this whole Wow
[1:37:41] it's gonna be ruled by her an
[1:37:44] America a ham is gonna do her duty to
[1:37:48] dues
[1:37:49] hallelujah but because of that we are
[1:37:52] the ones that I in battle
[1:37:55] right we're battling right now well we
[1:37:59] don't win the wall we don't lose the
[1:38:01] wall we win it

[1:38:16] brother Ben was sitting on a stand and a
[1:38:18] half kneeling on the mountain up there
[1:38:20] Oh
[1:38:21] something a sword hit his hand y'all
[1:38:23] remember the story and and and the Holy
[1:38:27] Ghost says and brother and said it was
[1:38:29] so real so real he said the Holy Spirit
[1:38:32] said to him this is the keen sword right
[1:38:36] you don't have a sword if there's not a
[1:38:39] battle
[1:38:41] the sword was given for the battle
[1:38:45] hallelujah and then he comes along he
[1:38:47] ties the sword into the revealing of the
[1:38:50] seven seals
[1:38:52] the opening of the word Amen he ties the
[1:38:55] sword in there and then he gives you the
[1:38:58] sword you didn't know was a sword but
[1:39:00] this is the sword the Bible said that
[1:39:03] the Word of God is
[1:39:22] the woman amen is in birth

[1:39:29] enemy could get to her she gave birth to
[1:39:31] the child
[1:39:33] before the enemy can get to you and me
[1:39:36] God is giving us birth
[1:39:40] that's why the priest the message
[1:39:43] brought pains because he knew the
[1:39:45] problem is my pains and then God gonna
[1:39:48] give her birth because the enemy come
[1:39:51] after you

[1:56:58] decided to make this their home church
[1:57:00] by God's grace so that's why they
[1:57:03] recognize them but I felt bad like I
[1:57:04] want to recognize them they make these
[1:57:05] huge sacrifices just to come and be with
[1:57:07] us so let's give them round
[1:57:14] we're so thankful where everybody has a
[1:57:16] part you sisters
[1:57:18] sisters had a major part just your
[1:57:21] yielding to the Holy Spirit and prank
[1:57:24] and then screaming and shouting for God
[1:57:27] or bowing your head you had such a major
[1:57:28] part now how many brothers would say
[1:57:30] amen to that no brothers you don't see
[1:57:33] us like break down like sisters you
[1:57:34] don't see the brothers break down and
[1:57:35] scream right too much right you know
[1:57:36] we'll cry too that's our kind of way to
[1:57:39] do that
[1:57:40] sisters are the ones that scream and
[1:57:42] really get under that full anointing and
[1:57:45] lead to just give themselves over to
[1:57:47] that Amen
[1:57:48] sisters you have just as important part
[1:57:51] as us brothers do everybody has a part
[1:57:54] right and that anointing is that's the
[1:57:57] atmosphere in that atmosphere all things
[1:58:00] are possible
[1:58:00] yeah to them that believe praise God
[1:58:03] what greater miracle could you have than
[1:58:05] to have a soul saved and a soul filled
[1:58:08] with the Holy Ghost is there any greater
[1:58:10] America oh you might have got your sight
[1:58:13] back but you're out you're gonna die and
[1:58:15] you won't be able to see right with
[1:58:16] those eyes anymore but if you got your
[1:58:18] soul sealed it's sealed for all eternity
[1:58:21] praise God let's put value in the things
[1:58:24] that are most valuable praise God well

[1:58:29] the gifts of the Spirit operate how many
[1:58:31] one see that I wanna see awful operate
[1:58:33] but the main thing I want to see is
[1:58:35] souls on this earth gets sealed and
[1:58:37] recognize that their names were on the
[1:58:40] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:58:41] foundation of the world that's the most
