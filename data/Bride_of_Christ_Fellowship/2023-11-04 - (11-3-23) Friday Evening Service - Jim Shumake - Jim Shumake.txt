that I'm not going to get into cuz I didn't study for that but that was the instrument that the priest would blow amen am amen a trumpet is what they blow to call the people to battle a trumpet amen blows and people can hear it from afar off amen amen but notice amen he didn't just stop with a trumpet amen he said there was other instrument were going to praise him too it's just not for the priest to do the praising it's just not for the priest to do the praising there's other instruments here that might have been a Priestly instrument but then he said praise him with the sultry now I did a little bit of Investigation upon this portion of the scripture and the Sutter was something I guess that the Levites played now don't quote me on that but this little little little thing that I was looking on the internet the best I could today that was something that the the Levites played so okay we got it's okay for the priests and the Levites to praise Him amen but he didn't stop there I'm so glad he didn't stop amen hallelujah he said praise him on the harp amen praise him with the the timal and the dance amen he said that same scripture said the timberl was an instrument that a common woman could play Amen in the congregation oh it's not just for the priest it's right down to the common people that can still praise him tonight amen praise him with the timberl and the dance praise him with the string instrument and the organs Praise Him upon the loud symbols Praise Him upon the high sounding symbol let everything that ha breath praise ye the Lord I want to ask you

and thank you for it in Jesus name amen and amen amen you can be seated if you want you don't have to be if you don't want last night we looked at a little thought and I said I'm going to try to tie these thoughts together tonight by the grace of the Lord how many are in a hurry and then I hope not because I got more here than I could probably get out tonight amen that's all right amen amen this is inexhaustible this is inexhaustible amen you can't put an stopping or starting point to it it's just inexhaustible it's Eternal amen amen amen I thank God Amen one of these days we'll be out of this old time body that we're stuck in we can just Rejoice forever and ever and ever that just seem like a moment amen amen but tonight I'll try to keep it within a moment in time that we can all amen endure amen let's put it that way amen last night we looked in 1st Samuel and we looked at the thought in 1 Samuel how that uh we we took the thought hither to the Lord have helped us hither too I preached this in our church amen a few months ago I don't remember how many months ago in our church but amen I I felt led of the Lord to preach that here last night and I believe it was the way that God the Lord wanted us to go but in that scripture Samuel amen talks to the people of God and he talks to him about amen turning to the Lord and getting the victory by turning back to the Lord how many knows we did we looked at that and he said when you put away the strange God among you and prepare your hearts unto the Lord and serve him only he will deliver you from the enemy amen that's a that's a promise from God righten as brother Mike said tonight in his prayer he says he's no respector of persons he'll do the same for you if you'll do the same for him how many believe that and we know the Bible tells us down there in 1st Samuel 7:4 said the children did put away the god they did start worshiping the Lord they did come under the under the word of the Prophet for that hour they did what he said to do amen and he offered up a s a sacrifice for their sin it was the bleeding lamb how many knows it was the truth amen how many bleedings like we said last night it's bleeding lamb that offered for us too amen and he offered up the bleeding lamb he poured out the water upon the ground there were Washed by the Water of the word and the blood of the Lamb amen hallelujah and we realize then they went to battle amen the enemy was still there but when they went to battle they realized amen that God had kept his word they turned to him when they repented of their sin God fought their battle God fought the enemy God destroyed the Philistines from before them they didn't have to do it amen hallelujah amen well that's that's yesterday's Glory but it still excites me today amen he said when they there and he says when they realized that the enemy was fighting their battle amen and that they didn't have to fight they pursued the enemy rather than the enemy pursuing them like we said last night amen you don't flee from the devil you resist the devil and he will flee from you he says and the enemy began to flee from them when they resisted him by the power of God Amen and the enemy began to flee and the people when they realized the enemy was fleeing they pursued the devil I pursue that devil where did he do it right on my knees right in this word every day I pursue him amen what's my weapon prayer what's my weapon the word what's my weapon faith in that word brother said take that weapon of the word of God in the strong hand of faith and cut your way to Victory amen how many want to do that tonight amen I better watch it I'll get off of my I'm not even preaching my message tonight amen but when those people began to realize that they had the victory amen when they begin to realize that they had the victory amen I want you to know it what it said there and I'm going to go back to what we preached last night in 1st Samuel 7:11 it said the men of Israel went out of mispa and they pursued the Philistines and smoked them until they came unto bethar how many remember what bethar means oh church if you remember oh write it down put it on the fridge amen it said they pursued him until they came under bethar what's it mean to come under bethcar that word bethar am me it's a Hebrew word it means the house of lambs it means the house of exaltation Hallelujah it it means the house of Leaping about or dancing amen when they realize that they had the victory they begin to exalt God they begin to praise God they begin to LEAP about hallelujah amen you're crazy brother Jim leave me alone hallelujah hallelujah I begin to praise him in the dance I begin to LEAP about why because I had been given the victory through Christ Hallelujah glory amen oh you're just trying to work something up you'll had somebody tell me that that's somebody told me brother Jim he we're tired of all this shouting and this screaming he you bring these preachers in and they start shouting they start screaming they start jumping you know not everybody likes that I said they need to get the victory they need to get the victory if they had what I had it produces it they said oh Hallelujah but you're just trying to get the people worked up you're just trying to get the people all worked up you're just trying to get the people all worked up and they'll feel if they don't shout if they don't D that they don't have God Amen no I didn't say that I didn't say the shout produce God I didn't say the dance produce God I said God produced the shout God produces the de Hallelujah glory amen that's what the word says I can't help what the word says am Glory well I don't like that I don't like that too noisy for me look what it said here in Psalms amen we're going to take off from bethar we're going to take off from Beth car last night when they realized they had the victory in him they started leaping they started rejoicing they started praising God and God Amen if you know you got the victory you can't help but praise him you can't help but Rejoice am the psalmist knew about the victory amen the psalmist said praise the Lord sing sing the Lord a new song Praise the congre in the congregation of the Saints who praised them who's the Saints the ones that have been delivered amen the ones that got the victory Hallelujah if you you're in a bunch of people that got the victory here tonight we ought to praise him in in the congregation of the Saints amen am oh he said let Israel rejoice in the him that made him let the children of Zion be joyful how many children of Zion do we got here tonight you ought to Bey joyful you know I saw I saw people sit on the Pew before and fold their hands when I'm trying to preach and just look at me and say

they started dancing and they started rejoicing they started going around here and you know people talk evil of that oh God help us amen God help us they said you're giving those people they'll go back to their congregations and because there's nobody dancing am me they'll think that they haven't got it and they'll have to go back to Camp again just to get a dance that's all they're going for is the dance that's all they're going for is the workup amen when they go back home if they really had it they take the dance with them they take it with them you know what you know what when Miriam

amen and he said I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice amen look oh look at there was a loud voice in heaven he said I saw angel proclaiming with the loud voice amen now I lost my place who is worthy to open the book and loose the seals thereof no man in heaven no man in earth no man under the Earth was able to open the the book and look there upon amen and I wept much because no man was worthy to open the book and read the book neither to look look thereup amen he says and one of the elders saith unto me don't weep weep not John I say weep not little bride amen because there is one amen the lion of the tribe of Judah amen hath prevailed the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and loose the seals thereof there's one who's opened the book who's made it an open book who give us a revelation Hallelujah hither to God has helped me there's a rock of Revelation given to the bride and when they got that Revelation what did they do they begin to dance around and their Beth car they begin to Rejoice they begin to exalt their God hallelujah amen you're just tying two scriptures indiscriminately know the word of God always compliments itself amen amen amen and when he had taken the book listen to this this this in my heading I got scoffield Bible I don't know if you got a Scofield bible my Scofield bible says in this portion going into the eth verse it said the living creatures and the Elder Elders are worshiping amen amen because of redemption amen why are they worshiping because they've been redeemed because they've got the victory they've been set free they've been they've come under the blood of the land they they are worshiping Redemption amen and when they had taken the book The Four beasts and the four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps what are we supposed to praise him on one of the instruments was a harp the elders had the harps amen amen he knew that that was an instrument of Praise amen he said every one of them fell down with Harps and golden bows full of odors which was the prayers of the saint and they sang a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and open the seal thereof for thou was slain and hath redeemed Us by God by the to God by the blood they've been redeemed to God by the blood they were Redeemed by God to God by the blood they had a new song they were playing on harp they were rejoicing amen hallelujah how many are Redeemed by the blood amen amen we have reason to rejoice in heaven because of redemption amen hallelujah he had and hath made read down the blood of every Kindred tongue and people and nation and hath made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on Earth amen or over the Earth and here's the part I want to get to we're getting to the good stuffen it's all good stuff amen he said I behold and I heard a voice of many angels many angels round about the throne and beasts and elders and the number of them was 10,000 times thousands and thousands of thousands amen I heard them loud voices proclaiming how many 10 thousands time thousands of thousands if you don't think that's all low worship amen you've never been in a place that worships Goden amen if 15 or 20 of us here can make this much noise what's it going to be like in heaven with thousands time thousands and 10,000 time 10,000 begin to Rejoice at the Redemption of God

he wasn't in the the noise no he was in the still Small Voice I never said he was the noise I never said he was the noise let's look at that him just for a minute if that's okay because you know that's what people put in my face that's what people would that's what the enemy tries to do to you he tries to quiet you down amen why because he don't want the sisters on the bank getting a hold of it too he don't want them getting he don't want it's catchy amen he don't want he wants he don't want them to have the victory amen over in First Kings men the scripture that they use against those people that want to make noise and rejoice and make noise to God they take Elijah and they said and Elijah what are you doing here on this mountain he said I've been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts for the children of Israel have forsaken thy Covenant TK down thy altar slain the prophets with the sword and even I only I am left to seek they seek my life to take it and he said go forth and stand upon the mountain before the Lord and behold the Lord pass by you know the scripture as well as I do but let me just put my what I call it amen my type to it let's put it that way he said the Lord passed by and a great strong wind rent the mountains and break it in pieces and the Rocks before the Lord amen a great strong wind how many have ever heard a great strong wind amen how many have ever heard a hurricane how many have ever heard a tornado that's it you know I heard a tornado where I live they had a tornado come through and take half of my town off the map one time it sounded like a freight train coming through the front yard it was loud yes am it was loud amen oh but brother Jim he wasn't in the freight train he wasn't in the strong wind amen you take a wind strong enough to break the mountains and bust them into pieces you're going to hear it amen amen oh but he wasn't in that the Bible said brother Jim I'm getting to it amen he said the strong wind rent the out to break into peace of the rocks of the Lord but the Lord was not in the wind and after the wind there was an earthquake how many have ever heard an earthquake I never have but they they said they Rumble and you can hear them and feel them for Miles amen amen amen is that right but the Lord was not in the earthquake uhoh you better quit that shouting then he said and after the earthquake there was a fire how many have ever heard of fire amen I have you get a bonfire going you can hear it I got a wood stove in my in my house amen and I leave the door open when I'm getting it started and give it a good Guff amen a draft whatever you want to call it amen get that thing to crack it and crunch it like that and if I forget something times I do something else and all a sudden I hear this whoa I hear fire amen it makes some noise amen but he wasn't in the noise of the fire amen so what are you talking about tonight brother gent oh I'm glad you asked he said and after the earthquake of fire and at the Lord was in the fire but at the fire a still small voice and it was so when Elijah heard it he wrapped his face in his M went out and stood on the or and the Lord of God spoke to him amen yes you know what the lord of God has spoke to me amen he told me what I was doing was wrong just like he told him here's what I want you to do you're going at this all the wrong way the still Small Voice is what spoke to me amen amen but you know what brought the still Small Voice it said the Lord passed by amen amen the Lord passed by amen he wasn't he wasn't making the noise am but the noise was there when he passed by and if the Lord passes by here tonight guess what it's going to cause I'm not saying he was the noise but he caused the noise when he passed by when his presence passes by it always make some noise amen hallelujah oh he wasn't in it no he was in the still small voice but his presence his passing by created enough wind or created enough noise created enough fire amen oh I'm tell you one thing when he passed by one day a Holy Ghost and Fire fell in me amen he was in me then and I tell you what I began to make Some Noise he made [Music] Hallelujah it wasn't him that made the noise it wasn't the fire that made the noise it come in quietly the spirit of God comes in like a wind like Mariah you can't hear it you don't know where it go where it comes from the church amen the

way back when it was brought back to its resting place amen when David he said when David saw the word as it was then it was tables of stone you know the story back then that was the word the Ark of C that was the word back then he says when David saw the word brought back to its right place David rejoiced and he started dancing in the spirit around and around when he saw the word brought back to its right place we are living in the hour when we have seen the word taken out of denominational ideas Tak wild out of man's idea and put back in its rightful place put back where it ought to be put back the way it's supposed to be we've got a message of the hour that puts the word back where it belongs amen hallelujah they don't have it out there they don't have it over there the word's been put

day Vindicated by the word of God [Applause] Amen when he saw the word back in its right place he danced amen he rejoiced amen [Applause] amen he said what the world he's now not some Seminary preacher some theological mixup but an oldfashioned Pentecostal preacher will stand in the Pulpit with the word and see it Vindicated amen by the word amen amen how many know we saw an oldfashioned Vindicated Prophet bring the word and watch God vindicate that word every time amen amen Glory Hallelujah why wouldn't we Rejoice amen hallelujah talk about re rival amen that'll produce a Revival that story that we just read about David amen it's found over 2 Samuel the 6th chapter let's just read it so we have an idea I know y'all know this but it's in my note so I'm going to read it but you know I already passed by a page or so that was in my notes that I didn't read amen but listen in second Samuel the 6 uh verse 6 2 Samuel chapter 6 ver2 it was told King David saying the the Lord had blessed the house of obededom and all that pertaineth unto him because the Ark of God and because of the Ark of God that was in his house amen notice wherever the word of God is the house is blessed amen hallelujah you get that Ark in your house you get that word in your house guess what your house will be blessed today the blessings will pour out the enemy can't can't keep the blessings from coming amen I think of brother Jesse I look at his house I look at his children why the word of God is in his house I see God blessing his house I see him blessing his children amen glory amen it's probably the same is true in all your houses too but I know Jesse and I don't know some of you but I know the word of God is no respector person amen amen he began to see this house was blessed and so it was when they they bear the Ark of the Lord he went to get the arc Ark of the Lord out of the house of OB OB Edom amen into the city of David with gladness amen with gladness amen amen and as it was so when a be of the Ark the Lord had gone six paces and sacrifice he sacrificed oxin and fatlings and David danced before the Lord with a little dance all his might he didn't leave anything out he danced before the Lord with all his might hallelujah amen brother Jim you're crazy amen then David was crazy amen then God was crazy because God looked down when David was dead with all his he said you're a man after My Old Heart GL that's what I want to be I want to be a man after God's Own Heart Tonight Hallelujah not after some man's heart what some man think I want what God thinks amen hallelujah God thinks that's pleasing amen he danced with all his might GED with a linen eal so David and all his house of Israel brought up the Ark of the Lord Lord with shouting and the sounds of trumpets they brought it up with shouting amen they brought the word with shouting Heen I'm bringing the word with shouting tonight I'm sorry that's the only way I know how to bring it [Applause] am Glory I'm not against those people that can bring it up quietly I mean I just ain't one of them Hallelujah am I brother Mike no no amen you know I thought I think what the what the prophet of God said said you watch the preacher if he goes like that the people go like that if I shout guess what Mike comes off the front row and he shouts too am Hallelujah when when miam danced down the river he took all the maids with them and they shouted and dance Too amen hallelujah why it's not brother Jim making brother Mike shout but it's the same God making brother Jim shout is making brother Mike shout the same Revelation that makes me shout makes brother Mike Shout it's the word brought back to its rightful place amen hallelujah glory amen he said he brought the ark up with shouting and the sound of a trumpet and at the Ark of the Lord came into the city Michel Saul's daughter Saul and looked through a window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord and she despised him in her heart that's old festical Spirit still alive today amen I've had people look at me and despise me in their heart because of that very same thing that's what brought this message on that's what brought this message on amen amen Michael's daughter looked through the window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord and she despised him in her heart and they brought the Ark of the Lord in and set it in its place in the midst of the Tabernacle and David had pitched that David had pitched for and David offered burnt offering and peace offering before the Lord he began to worship God Amen seeing the word brought back in his place he began to make offerings to that word offering I bring the sacrifice of praise I bring an offering of worship I water that word that's been brought back into his place with praise tonight Hallelujah he began to make offerings amen I believe we ought to do the same and as soon that David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offering and he blessed the people in the name of the Lord of hosts amen Heen d David brought the word back to where it belonged amen David set the word where it belonged in back in the church amen and guess what and then he began to bless the people because what he' done with the word I see brother Jesse bring the word back into the church where it's supposed to be and he get what the church begins to get blessed because of what David did amen oh church let have a few more people that'll stand behind the pulpits and bring the word back into the congregation amen bring it back into the place Glory that on people will become blessed amen he blessed the people in the name of the Lord of host amen and listen what he did he dealt among them here I go again typing and he dealt among the people even among the whole multitude of Israel as well as the woman as men he said to everyone a cake of bread a good piece of Flesh and a flagen of wine so the people departed even one everyone to his own house blessed amen well fed well watered amen well sustained well kept amen why because the word had been brought back and David by bringing the word back began to bless the people he sent them home from church well blessed well fed with the water with the word hallelujah amen he sent him home rejoicing he sent him home with enough to get him through he sent him enough with enough to sustain life amen that's what that food does that white is the type of the Holy Ghost he gave another double portion of the Holy Ghost and said take it go home Rejoice live on Hallelujah Glory but when he came to his own house when he came to his own church when brother Jim come to his own church there was people that said there and said the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said how glor glorious was the king look at the sarcasm in this woman's voice how glorious was the king of Israel today and me how many know we're Kings and priest he said how glorious was the king who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the handmaids and his hand servants and everyone of of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovered himself amen he took all the Rapids of his manhood off and nothing was showing through but the glory of God it wasn't David that was there he uncovered himself he said I'm laying myself open to the word whatever the word says I want to do he shamelessly took all his dignity he took all his dignity and his his pride and he laid it aside said Lord God I want you to have the pre oh you say that's not what it means amen I told you I'm a typologist it said he he just that means he didn't have any clothes on that means to me he didn't have any his own clothes on amen he was clothed with righteousness he was closed with the word and he didn't care how it made him act she despised him and David and sa said to Michael it was before the Lord who chose me before thy father and before his house to appointed me to rule over the people the Lord over Israel therefore will I play before him I'm going to do this because God chose me I've I'm chosen how many knows you're predestinated chosen before the foundation of the worlden to represent God in this hour Glory I will yet be more vile than thus amen You Haven't Seen Nothing Yet the half is no yet been told I'll be more vile than thus I will be based in my own sight I don't care but anybody thinks of brother Jim I don't care what some other preacher says I don't care what some other PR Church says I don't care I know what God says and when David rejoiced when David de when David uncovered himself he said that's a man after my own heart I want to be a man after his heart tonight I'll be more V than thus amen and before the maid servants and those that thou spoken of them shall I be had in honor they'll say he not some big shot that thinks he's got to be so dignified he's willing to lay himself open you know lot these preachers say God and holy and oh don't don't
