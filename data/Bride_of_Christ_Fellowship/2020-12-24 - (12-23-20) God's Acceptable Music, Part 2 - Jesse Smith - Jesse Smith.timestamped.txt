[29:30] ephesians 5 10.
[29:34] give you a moment to get there i'm still
[29:36] getting there
[29:42] look at god's acceptable music part two
[29:59] tonight we'll be looking at more just
[30:00] general scriptures about music
[30:02] uh being a new song and having a new
[30:04] song and a few of brother graham's
[30:06] quotes about that and
[30:08] how we looked at last week in future
[30:11] weeks lord willing perhaps this weekend
[30:12] we'll be looking at
[30:13] what makes a song acceptable unto god or
[30:16] a song
[30:16] unacceptable unto god lord willing we'll
[30:19] be studying on that more in the next few
[30:21] days
[30:22] and we'll continue this series by god's
[30:24] grace
[30:26] so i just want to encourage brother amen
[30:28] and lydia and malachi we had
[30:30] numerous people come this weekend and
[30:31] say they were so blessed by the music
[30:33] so it's not to make anybody prideful but
[30:36] it's to uh
[30:38] to uh just show a witness that uh
[30:41] visitors come and they can sense the
[30:43] presence of the lord and they can
[30:44] see everyone's dedication and creates a
[30:47] real freedom and they come up and told
[30:48] me with the these shining faces just so
[30:51] happy
[30:52] it was neat to see that so thank you for
[30:54] uh our musicians for playing skillfully
[30:57] sometimes loud sometimes quiet right and
[31:00] worshiping the lord
[31:01] because it creates such a beautiful
[31:02] atmosphere
[31:04] so ephesians 5 10 we looked at this last
[31:06] week about
[31:07] were the children of light in verse 8
[31:10] not
[31:11] darkness and it's our
[31:14] duty to prove what is pleasing to god so
[31:17] let's read ephesians 5 10 together
[31:19] on 3 1 2 3 proving what is acceptable
[31:24] unto the lord now if you would go down
[31:27] here
[31:28] let's go down to verse 19 we know verse
[31:32] 18 talks about being filled with the
[31:33] spirit singing is one way
[31:35] to keep the anointing of the holy spirit
[31:37] in our minds
[31:41] so let's read verse 19 as well one two
[31:44] three
[31:45] speaking to yourselves in psalms and
[31:48] hymns and spiritual songs
[31:51] singing and making melody in your heart
[31:54] to the lord amen may god has blessings
[31:57] to read his word you may be seated
[32:02] so just for convenience sake here uh
[32:05] i'll be preaching off the ipad every now
[32:06] and then i'll
[32:08] reach back here well maybe i'll reach
[32:09] over here and get my bible i will read
[32:11] some longer portions of scripture
[32:14] but you know i have a bible on here too
[32:17] and
[32:17] since i don't have a pulpit in front of
[32:19] me i just have to hold this here
[32:21] so god bless everybody let me set a
[32:24] quick timer here so don't go too long
[32:32] we'll set it for 45 minutes and see how
[32:34] that goes tonight we want to keep going
[32:36] with the 6 30 start time
[32:40] heading into 2021 just helps our family
[32:44] get to bed a little bit earlier
[32:46] uh especially during the work week and
[32:48] the school week
[32:49] it is really nice so we're gonna try to
[32:51] stay at that 6 30 start time and
[32:54] you know sometimes if we don't get
[32:55] started till 6 35 or 6 40
[32:57] hope that's okay uh with our live
[32:59] streamers uh
[33:00] if we're running behind or something
[33:01] like that but uh by god's grace we would
[33:04] like to
[33:05] keep going at 6 30 just to give us a
[33:08] little more rest
[33:09] on wednesday nights so god bless
[33:11] everybody
[33:14] coming off a wonderful weekend there
[33:15] with brother cam ministering through the
[33:17] holy spirit
[33:19] and uh seeing his family what a great
[33:20] time we had the lord here
[33:24] i think i'll start here with just again
[33:25] reading the references that i've been
[33:27] using
[33:28] as i'm studying the first one is ben
[33:30] narad sermon
[33:31] it's on our youtube channel from april
[33:34] 2016
[33:35] called the approach to war music i've
[33:37] been listening to that listen
[33:38] part of it today uh just a tremendous
[33:41] message from the holy spirit
[33:43] also i've been listening to the seven
[33:44] part series by
[33:46] dr frank garlock on youtube and all
[33:49] these i recommend i think they're really
[33:51] great
[33:53] teachings now the next one is a 10 part
[33:55] series by a brother in the seventh day
[33:57] adventist church
[33:59] named christian b i forgot his last name
[34:02] now this one you got to be kind a little
[34:03] bit careful he plays lots of samples of
[34:06] worldly music so
[34:07] if you're struggling with worldly music
[34:09] i wouldn't recommend listening to that
[34:11] one maybe
[34:12] because he'll play like you know longer
[34:14] portions of their songs maybe
[34:16] 30 seconds or something and then certain
[34:20] images he'll show as well now he tries
[34:22] to
[34:22] block out you know um immoral parts i
[34:26] appreciate that
[34:27] um but just so you know if you are
[34:30] struggling with music and
[34:31] worldly music i would just stay away
[34:33] from now it's a 10 part series that's
[34:35] over 12 hours long
[34:38] so i was listening to it on the second
[34:39] speed or twice the speed
[34:41] to get through a little faster and then
[34:44] the fourth reference
[34:45] uh listened to a little bit this week
[34:46] was the article from rebecca branham
[34:50] smith
[34:50] from 1992 called music the sound and
[34:53] unsound
[34:55] so again those are my four references
[34:57] i'm using right now
[35:00] of course along with the bible and
[35:01] brother rams message but those are the
[35:03] four additional ones you might want to
[35:05] enjoy as well so just real briefly we
[35:09] saw four important duties now we know
[35:11] there's more
[35:11] i'll probably add more but we looked at
[35:14] the four duties
[35:15] we have to prove what pleases god with
[35:17] rhythm and lyrics
[35:18] second we have to create the right
[35:20] atmosphere so singing with sincerity
[35:25] and third identify the meanings of
[35:27] sounds
[35:29] now this one might even go with the
[35:30] first one actually that when i think
[35:31] about it
[35:32] a little more um
[35:35] proving what pleases god is probably
[35:37] doing that same thing identifying
[35:39] uh the sounds of golly music versus the
[35:43] sounds of worldly music so those could
[35:46] too could be interchangeable
[35:47] and then fourth uh it's our duty to
[35:50] introduce new songs
[35:52] okay so tonight i want to look i just
[35:54] want to begin by looking at the
[35:55] scriptures about
[35:56] new songs okay so children get your
[35:58] bibles ready got
[35:59] numerous scriptures and hopefully
[36:01] they'll read loud enough or hopefully
[36:03] they're all close enough to the computer
[36:04] so everybody can hear their voices
[36:07] by god's grace so as i told you last
[36:09] week there's nine verses that say
[36:11] new songs uh new songs and so
[36:14] there's a nice sample there of the holy
[36:18] spirit saying sing to me a new song
[36:20] sing a new song well the only way you
[36:21] can sing a new song is if he gives you a
[36:23] song
[36:24] and so god is in other words god is
[36:26] saying sing a new song
[36:27] let me inspire you for a new song and
[36:30] it'll do that many times for giving you
[36:31] a victory
[36:32] or giving you a testimony
[36:37] so start with uh lydia lydia let's do
[36:39] psalms
[36:40] 33 malachi if you get psalms 40. acacia
[36:43] psalm 96.
[36:45] haven if you like greenhouse even
[36:49] how do you feel okay psalm 98.
[36:55] okay so lydia will start off off with
[36:58] psalms 33
[37:00] verses 1 2 and 3.
[37:04] rejoice in the lord o ye righteous who
[37:06] praises comely for the upright
[37:08] praise the lord with harp sing unto him
[37:10] with the salt tree and an instrument of
[37:12] ten strings
[37:13] sing unto him a new song play skillfully
[37:15] with a loud noise
[37:17] amen thank you now let's look at a few
[37:19] thoughts in here verse one
[37:21] notice praise is calmly or
[37:24] beautiful for the upright praise is
[37:27] boring to the sinner
[37:28] right and perhaps the foolish virgin but
[37:31] to the holy ghost-filled saint who's
[37:33] upright in the truth and
[37:35] keeping all sin out of their lives
[37:37] confessing other sins
[37:38] praise is a beautiful thing because they
[37:42] realize all their power comes from god
[37:44] right we don't have any power strength
[37:46] of our own all of us
[37:48] unless we're attached to the vine we
[37:50] have no life right nothing good about
[37:52] any of us jesus said apart from me
[37:53] you're nothing
[37:54] that's my life scripture john 15 5. i'm
[37:57] nothing if anything good comes out of my
[37:58] life
[37:59] it's because i was attached to jesus and
[38:01] all glory to jesus for that
[38:04] so it's a beautiful thing for those who
[38:06] are walking true to god
[38:08] to sing praises so that gives us a clue
[38:10] if we're in our church service and we're
[38:12] not really enjoying the worship
[38:14] we need to look at our lives and see am
[38:16] i living up right before god or have i
[38:18] allowed some
[38:19] sin to creep into my life if we're
[38:22] if we're serving god with joy and
[38:24] happiness song service ought to be a
[38:26] great highlight to our day
[38:28] praise god verse two we use we see some
[38:31] instruments now a harp
[38:32] sultry instrument of strings praise god
[38:36] that's so we love by the amens guitar
[38:37] malachi can play guitar as well and
[38:39] of course the strings and the piano and
[38:40] there's piano strings on the inside they
[38:42] got a titan
[38:43] tune and everything i'm not much of a
[38:45] musician so we thank the lord for that
[38:47] stringed
[38:48] instruments now verse 3
[38:51] sing unto him a new song now the
[38:53] definition in hebrew is new
[38:55] but it's also fresh sing to him a fresh
[38:59] song
[39:00] play skillfully with a loud noise now
[39:02] the word noise means
[39:04] a shout for joy okay so in other words
[39:06] we have to have a
[39:07] fresh shout a fresh reason
[39:11] right a fresh way to be joyful in our
[39:14] lord
[39:15] like that first song all my songs i'll
[39:18] sing for you jesus there's a song in my
[39:20] soul
[39:20] right that's a was a new song to us
[39:23] recently in that last few years and it's
[39:24] still a new song it's a
[39:26] fresh song for all of your goodness i'll
[39:28] love you forever jesus
[39:30] so see these are uh these are desires of
[39:33] god that we want to walk in
[39:35] and we want to manifest we want to
[39:39] sing him a fresh song from our heart we
[39:42] want to shout it with joy
[39:43] praise god so see fresh songs
[39:47] make you joyful so see there's a reason
[39:50] people
[39:50] when they come to church they're not
[39:51] joyful right they they don't sing a new
[39:54] song
[39:54] or they haven't got a victory in the
[39:57] lord
[39:58] right they haven't trusted god or they
[39:59] got sin in their lives
[40:01] so there's no joy in their song there's
[40:03] no joy in their life
[40:04] but as believers if we're walking
[40:06] upright confessing our sin
[40:08] and then obeying the word of god we get
[40:10] the blessings and benefits of obedience
[40:13] which makes us joyful we see victory we
[40:15] see satan under our feet praise god
[40:17] and we walk victorious and we possess
[40:20] the land as brother cam was talking on
[40:21] sunday right we possess
[40:23] our inheritance footsteps our possession
[40:26] praise god in other words
[40:27] we're winning the battles we're
[40:29] overcoming satan we're overcoming every
[40:31] temptation
[40:32] and we sing a new song because we got a
[40:34] fresh victory we got a fresh testimony
[40:37] for jesus christ
[40:39] [Music]
[40:40] psalms 40 verse 1
[40:44] 2 3 and 4. so malachi please four verses
[40:48] i waited patiently for the lord and he
[40:50] inclined unto me and heard my cry
[40:53] he brought me up also out of a horrible
[40:55] pit out of the miry clay
[40:57] and set my feet upon a rock and
[40:58] established my goings
[41:00] and he hath put a new song in my mouth
[41:02] even praise unto our god
[41:04] many shall see and fear and shall trust
[41:06] in the lord
[41:07] blessed is that man that maketh the
[41:09] lord's trust and respecteth not the
[41:10] proud
[41:11] nor such as turn aside to lies amen
[41:15] so david writes this after he was in a
[41:17] pit after he was in an
[41:18] awful situation dirty mirey clay right
[41:23] just an awful spot to be in but the lord
[41:26] delivered him
[41:27] he had to now look look church had to
[41:29] patiently wait in that dirt right
[41:31] patiently
[41:32] uh wait in the muck he had to patiently
[41:35] wait until god
[41:36] uh had it in his right time in season to
[41:39] deliver
[41:40] david out of there he brought him out of
[41:42] a dirty place a bad place
[41:44] how many can say god's brought me out of
[41:46] a bad place right awful place a
[41:49] rotten place right but when he did that
[41:52] he set your feet on
[41:53] something that's solid right your life
[41:55] feels like it's back
[41:56] as it should be praise god your life
[41:58] doesn't feel like you're sinking or
[42:00] unstable your life feels stable you have
[42:03] firm
[42:04] foundation uh firm steps you know you're
[42:07] not gonna fall
[42:08] praise god amen because you're standing
[42:10] on a rock you're not gonna slip you're
[42:12] not gonna get dirty not gonna get filthy
[42:14] you know where you're standing and
[42:15] you're a victor you're more than a
[42:17] conqueror
[42:17] in christ jesus and he establishes all
[42:20] your ways because you're walking
[42:22] on the rock of the word not stranded
[42:25] right sometimes we feel stranded or we
[42:27] feel lost and
[42:28] hopeless we're in a ho we're in a pit
[42:29] right we're hopeless and
[42:31] it doesn't seem like we could ever get
[42:33] out but god will bring us out
[42:35] just wait patiently call upon the lord
[42:37] and then when he does
[42:38] the bible said i'll give you a new song
[42:40] amen
[42:41] [Music]
[42:42] and what is the song it's a song of
[42:44] praise i love this part did you catch
[42:46] this
[42:47] many shall see your new song
[42:50] after you get a victory so see god wants
[42:53] us to
[42:54] go through trials come out of those
[42:56] trials and then have a new song
[42:58] people will see our testimony my
[43:01] jesse was delivered or lydia malachi was
[43:04] delivered
[43:05] and look at him sing look at them
[43:07] testify right that's why i want to put
[43:08] our songs on facebook or youtube right
[43:11] people need to see what god has done
[43:14] and then the bible says many will see it
[43:16] here and shall trust in the lord
[43:19] it doesn't say uh maybe make converts
[43:22] right
[43:22] but it will encourage the saints praise
[43:25] god the believers will see your
[43:27] testimony
[43:28] they'll see your life your song and that
[43:30] will inspire them oh
[43:32] if god brought them out and bringing
[43:34] them and look at the joy of their lives
[43:36] god's going to bring me out the joy will
[43:37] come soon the joy may come in the
[43:39] morning or tomorrow morning or the
[43:40] morning after
[43:42] but i'll i'll have joy i'll be able to
[43:44] sing again and god will give me a
[43:45] testimony
[43:46] god will bring me out of this dark
[43:47] season and it'll bring me to the
[43:49] mountaintop
[43:50] [Music]
[43:51] hallelujah thank the lord see it's god
[43:54] who puts the new
[43:55] praise song in your mouth
[43:59] see but you got to let god or you got to
[44:01] open your mouth to sing it right
[44:03] god will bring you the song he'll
[44:04] introduce a new song or
[44:06] somebody else in most cases he'll allow
[44:09] you to hear a new song but you got to
[44:11] open your mouth we have to open our
[44:12] mouths and sing it
[44:14] and really feel it and understand this
[44:16] is what god
[44:17] has done for me so see god's songs are
[44:20] meant to inspire
[44:22] others to trust and have
[44:25] faith in god so that's that's where a
[44:28] song special can be such a blessing
[44:30] if somebody's been through a difficult
[44:32] time and then they sing a special it can
[44:36] just impact so many people one time i
[44:38] was at that women's
[44:39] retreat there in new york and one of the
[44:41] sisters was up there playing
[44:43] and before she played and sang the
[44:44] special she said this song came out of
[44:48] an awful dark time and that awful dark
[44:50] time was an abusive relationship
[44:53] but when she played that song every eye
[44:56] in the place
[44:57] was weeping and crying and praising the
[44:59] lord of such a beautiful song i need to
[45:00] contact the pastor
[45:02] and get that song i just wish i would
[45:04] have remembered to get that
[45:05] it was such a beautiful uh
[45:09] atmosphere of praise and worship and it
[45:11] reminds me of this scripture right here
[45:13] in a horrible pit abusive relationship
[45:16] but the lord brought her out
[45:18] gave her a new song and it caused many
[45:20] others to trust
[45:22] in the lord because if god can bring
[45:24] this person out
[45:25] and give him a new song and give him
[45:27] hope god can bring me out
[45:29] god can bring you out and god is going
[45:31] to do it and when he does
[45:33] sing the new song sing the new praise
[45:35] let everybody hear your testimony not
[45:37] not in pride but in humility to declare
[45:40] with the joy of god in your heart
[45:42] declare the works of the lord
[45:44] that others might be inspired not to
[45:46] give up on god but to trust in god
[45:48] and then sing the new song and give him
[45:50] praise
[45:52] hallelujah i think that's beautiful
[45:56] oh hallelujah help me the holy spirit to
[45:58] remember to get that song by god's grace
[46:01] all right psalm 96 all right keisha
[46:04] can you read verses one to four
[46:07] oh sing unto the lord and new songs sing
[46:10] unto the lord
[46:11] all the earth sing unto the lord bless
[46:14] his name
[46:15] show forth himself his salvation from
[46:18] day to day
[46:19] declare his glory among the heathen all
[46:22] his wonders among all people
[46:24] for the lord is great and greatly to be
[46:26] praised he is
[46:28] to be feared above all gods amen thank
[46:31] you
[46:32] just want to notice a few things here
[46:34] we're to sing a new song
[46:36] to the lord all the earth so everybody
[46:39] see everyone every church is required to
[46:41] sing a new song
[46:42] not just ours every church should have a
[46:44] new song
[46:45] that keeps the worship fresh right keeps
[46:48] it full of joy
[46:49] it sure does and then do it every day
[46:53] look day to day right we got to keep
[46:55] praising god to keep
[46:56] pressing play on the worship right and
[47:00] keep praising the lord
[47:01] each and every day can't stop we got to
[47:03] keep praising the lord let that
[47:04] atmosphere
[47:06] and the glory of god just fill our home
[47:09] we need to keep doing
[47:10] that and then if we get a chance we
[47:12] declare
[47:13] among all the people so no matter who's
[47:16] around us
[47:16] whatever who comes to church we should
[47:18] praise god as usual
[47:21] and then god is great and because he's
[47:23] so great he's supposed to be greatly
[47:25] praised
[47:26] that means exceeding so exceeding
[47:29] praised
[47:30] abundantly praised forcefully praised
[47:35] that's another expression so use our
[47:37] force right use our
[47:38] uh our our eagerness right to praise the
[47:41] lord
[47:42] it should be something that we should be
[47:43] eager to do
[47:45] and uh pour ourselves into it all of our
[47:48] hearts
[47:49] it shouldn't be a weak praise right or a
[47:52] faithless praise
[47:53] it should be a praise of faith that
[47:56] you've got confidence in god because you
[47:57] know god is great
[47:58] so i'm going to praise him greatly
[48:03] all right psalms 98. now this is the
[48:05] song we sang
[48:06] uh sunday it's called psalm 98
[48:11] sing unto the lord a new song for what
[48:16] he's done
[48:17] so that's the song that we sing where'd
[48:19] we get that song well we got it from
[48:21] i think shane and shane is the uh
[48:25] the artist who wrote that if i'm not
[48:26] mistaken
[48:28] uh now we gotta be careful with some of
[48:31] their songs of course they seem like
[48:32] really nice
[48:33] brothers in christ but of course they
[48:35] don't follow the message we got to be
[48:36] careful with some of the songs they do
[48:40] but it's a beautiful song if they wrote
[48:42] that that was truly inspired
[48:44] because it comes straight out of
[48:45] scripture so heaven why don't you just
[48:47] read the first two verses
[48:50] let's sing unto the lord a new son for
[48:52] he has done marvelous things
[48:54] his right hand in his holy arm has gone
[48:58] gotten him the victory the lord hath

[52:44] we don't sing sad songs right we sing
[52:46] are we singing songs of repentance that
[52:48] can be sad right
[52:49] if we need to repent but if we repented
[52:52] and all that then we need to sing a
[52:54] joyful noise
[52:55] unto the lord
[52:58] all right psalms 144.
[53:02] looks like we'll sing the lydia can you
[53:04] go to verse 9
[53:07] psalm 144 9.
[53:18] yeah i want to read the from nine down

[53:25] i will sing a new song unto thee oh god
[53:27] upon a sultry in an instrument of ten
[53:29] strings blessing praise unto thee
[53:31] it is he that gave us salvation unto
[53:33] kings who delivereth david his servant
[53:35] from the hurtful sword

[53:59] so it's okay to be a small church right
[54:00] because god's protecting us he's
[54:02] keeping us from pain so we should thank
[54:04] the lord for that praise god
[54:06] amen verse 11 rid me and deliver me from
[54:10] the hand of strange children whose mouth
[54:12] speaketh vanity
[54:14] and their right hand is a right hand of
[54:16] falsehood
[54:18] see we don't want to fill our mouths
[54:19] with vain things and
[54:21] ridiculous statements we want to sing
[54:24] and fill our mouths with the praises of
[54:26] god
[54:26] to glorify him for all he's done for us
[54:30] hallelujah here's verse 12. this is
[54:33] really going to encourage
[54:34] my sons and daughters hopefully
[54:38] that our sons may be as plants grown up
[54:42] in their youth so keep me from lying
[54:45] keep me from vain words
[54:47] that my sons may grow up like plants how
[54:50] do plants grow
[54:50] really fast right and really strong
[54:54] right so if we keep ourselves from
[54:58] evil words we can keep ourselves from
[55:00] evil associations
[55:02] and from lies and we live the truth our
[55:04] sons are going to grow up strong and
[55:06] quick right they're going to be really
[55:07] really good with the things of god

[55:10] the word of god and be strong and really
[55:12] show growth right how many want to grow
[55:14] really
[55:15] fast right you don't want to be you
[55:17] don't want stunted growth do you
[55:19] we don't want to be stunted in our

[55:26] to have fruit that always is bringing
[55:28] forth more and more fruit

[55:33] we want to benefit from being planted in
[55:35] christ
[55:36] we don't want a weak testimony we want a
[55:38] testimony of faith
[55:41] now this ought to encourage my daughters
[55:43] right here verse 12.

[55:47] daughters may be as
[55:49] cornerstones polished

[1:04:16] rather than scrolling on their phones on
[1:04:18] their beds what do you think
[1:04:21] they'd be a lot more happier if they
[1:04:23] sung on their beds
[1:04:25] right or how about complaining on their
[1:04:26] beds or watch a movie drinking a beer on
[1:04:28] their bed

[1:04:36] as you're going to bed sing in verse 5
[1:04:39] joyfully sing to god in your beds i know
[1:04:42] it's hard for us right especially with
[1:04:43] some of our little ones and
[1:04:45] they don't want to go to bed and they
[1:04:46] might not be in the best attitude

[1:05:35] him back
[1:05:36] in the name of jesus christ
[1:05:41] verse 7 to execute vengeance upon the
[1:05:45] heathen and punishments upon the people
[1:05:47] to bind their kings with chains and
[1:05:49] their nobles with
[1:05:51] fetters of iron wow
[1:05:54] that's what the word of god does right
[1:05:56] the bible said whatsoever you bind on

[1:05:59] is right there casting out devils right
[1:06:02] by singing well you know that with king

[1:06:06] singing casts out devils right it binds
[1:06:09] them up just like the bible said
[1:06:10] binds kings principalities powers with
[1:06:13] chains
[1:06:15] and their nobles with fetters of iron

[1:06:35] discouraged

[1:10:22] that we see in the scripture and we can
[1:10:24] sing that to god
[1:10:26] with the right rhythm the right lyrics
[1:10:29] the right expression and it glorifies
[1:10:31] the lord
[1:10:32] because god is the inspiration behind
[1:10:34] the lyrics
[1:10:35] and most of the music but then sometimes
[1:10:38] those artists
[1:10:39] inject as we saw last wednesday they
[1:10:42] inject some worldliness into it and
[1:10:44] we just we just take that out right we
[1:10:46] spit out the seeds and we just take the
[1:10:48] cherry pie praise god
[1:10:51] psalm 42 10. sing unto the lord a new
[1:10:55] song in his praise
[1:10:56] from the end of the earth ye that go
[1:10:59] down to the sea
[1:11:00] and all that is therein the isles and
[1:11:03] the inhabitants thereof
[1:11:05] so all those in the boats right all
[1:11:06] those in the islands as far as
[1:11:08] men are scattered praise god sing him
[1:11:12] a new song wherever you go over all the
[1:11:15] earth because god is the god of the
[1:11:17] whole earth praise god
[1:11:19] all right
[1:11:25] now that's the first seven bible
[1:11:29] hits on new songs let's go to revelation
[1:11:33] 5 and this will be the eighth and then
[1:11:35] revelation 14 will be the ninth so lydia
[1:11:38] revelation 5 malachi revelation 14.
[1:11:47] revelation 5 9 and 10 lydia can you read
[1:11:50] 9
[1:11:51] 10 and they sung a new song
[1:11:54] saying thou art worthy to take the book
[1:11:56] and to open the seals thereof for that
[1:11:57] which slain has redeemed us to god by
[1:12:00] thy blood out of every kindred and
[1:12:01] tongue and people and nation
[1:12:03] and hast made us unto our god kings and
[1:12:06] priests and we shall reign on the earth
[1:12:08] praise god so heaven heard a new song
[1:12:12] in revelation 5 when a new act was done
[1:12:16] right so previous to this new song
[1:12:19] the lamb had not come to take the book
[1:12:22] right
[1:12:22] still and had the seven seals on it we
[1:12:24] know that we know the
[1:12:25] the background of this right because in
[1:12:28] chapter six the first seal is taken off
[1:12:30] right
[1:12:32] so a new song comes when a new act is
[1:12:35] done
[1:12:36] so just like in our lives when we see
[1:12:38] something new happen
[1:12:40] it's like when god sends a godly husband
[1:12:42] for lydia one of these days
[1:12:43] that's a new thing right or a godly wife
[1:12:47] for malachi
[1:12:48] that's gonna be a new thing that's a
[1:12:50] news it should be a new song then
[1:12:52] so we'll be able to sing a new song
[1:12:54] where god has provided
[1:12:56] a great thing for us or if somebody gets
[1:13:00] sick god forbid but if somebody gets
[1:13:01] sick
[1:13:02] and god does something new he's never
[1:13:04] done before like with bangs you know
[1:13:05] father
[1:13:06] we should be able to sing a new song it
[1:13:08] should have new meaning to it
[1:13:10] amen hallelujah
[1:13:15] now if there's a new song when the seals
[1:13:17] were open
[1:13:18] what about the new song when the bride
[1:13:21] gets raptured
[1:13:23] that's never been done before right so
[1:13:25] there's gonna have to be a new song
[1:13:27] praise god because it's never happened
[1:13:29] before just like here this has never
[1:13:31] happened before
[1:13:32] so when it happened they sang a new song
[1:13:34] he's worthy right
[1:13:36] is he worthy is he worthy he is
[1:13:39] hallelujah
[1:13:40] of all blessing and honor and glory and
[1:13:44] power hallelujah
[1:13:46] thank the lord jesus so the wedding
[1:13:49] supper when she we have communion with
[1:13:50] jesus
[1:13:51] this is where your imagination should go
[1:13:53] to work right here right
[1:13:55] anything that's new new song
[1:13:58] millennium new song it's never happened
[1:14:01] before
[1:14:01] we've never had a thousand years of
[1:14:04] peace
[1:14:05] a thousand years with no mind battles we
[1:14:06] never had it what songs are we gonna
[1:14:08] sing in the millennium
[1:14:11] a thousand years of no war no more tanks
[1:14:15] and no more planes and
[1:14:17] bombs a thousand years what kind of
[1:14:19] songs are we going to sing
[1:14:22] hallelujah how about that song when the
[1:14:26] new jerusalem comes down how about that
[1:14:29] oh this is home right this is a new home
[1:14:32] song
[1:14:33] our eternal home future home wow they're
[1:14:36] going to be song about the future home
[1:14:37] praise god
[1:14:38] [Laughter]
[1:14:40] oh my revelation 14.
[1:14:47] now i read verses one to three one two
[1:14:49] three
[1:14:50] and i looked and lo the lamb stood on
[1:14:53] the mount zion and with
[1:14:55] and 4 000 having his father's name
[1:14:57] written in their foreheads
[1:14:59] and i heard a voice from heaven as the
[1:15:01] voice of many waters
[1:15:02] and as the voice of great thunder and i
[1:15:04] heard the voice of harper's harping with
[1:15:06] their harps
[1:15:07] and they sung as it were a new song
[1:15:09] before the throne
[1:15:10] and before the four beasts and the
[1:15:12] elders and no man could learn that song
[1:15:14] about 140 and 4 000 which were redeemed
[1:15:16] from the earth
[1:15:17] amen so see there are only there's some
[1:15:21] songs that
[1:15:21] only the redeemed can sing right we
[1:15:24] always talk about that with angels can't
[1:15:26] sing some of these
[1:15:27] songs right praise god
[1:15:32] and so here why is this a new song well
[1:15:35] if you guys have
[1:15:36] uh remember if you remember from when we
[1:15:39] preached on the covenants
[1:15:40] this is a new song because israel is no
[1:15:43] longer blinded right
[1:15:46] so now israel is just like joseph and
[1:15:49] his brother right
[1:15:50] oh we know this is joseph joseph is
[1:15:53] alive right
[1:15:54] he's not he's not he's upset with us
[1:15:57] israel is going to sing a new song
[1:16:00] because he realized oh
[1:16:01] our messiah already came and he's not
[1:16:03] upset with us in fact he received our
[1:16:06] repentance
[1:16:07] and he gave us the seal of the holy
[1:16:09] spirit in our souls praise god
[1:16:12] and we're redeemed by the lamb in other
[1:16:14] words we're not under the old covenant
[1:16:16] we have the new covenant praise god we
[1:16:19] have better
[1:16:20] promises we have better blessings we're
[1:16:22] singing a new song
[1:16:23] because we have a new covenant praise
[1:16:25] the lord amen
[1:16:27] that's why when we first can say boy we
[1:16:29] can really sing new songs
[1:16:31] to the lord because we are married to
[1:16:33] our old uh
[1:16:34] under our marriage covenant right uh
[1:16:36] romans 7 says that
[1:16:38] he says you were married to sin and and
[1:16:40] death
[1:16:41] but now he said you ought to be married
[1:16:43] to another even christ jesus hallelujah
[1:16:46] amen amen thank the lord jesus
[1:16:53] all right so my 45 minutes is about up
[1:16:55] here
[1:16:56] let's close with this i just want to
[1:17:00] take a few moments
[1:17:01] and close with this thought
[1:17:06] i mentioned it last week and it kind of
[1:17:07] came to me while i was ministering i
[1:17:09] thought what is it about singing
[1:17:12] singing is contacting the spirit realm
[1:17:16] right what is singing singing is
[1:17:20] reaching out to the heavenly realms
[1:17:25] because it's a spiritual act it's
[1:17:28] reaching out trying to
[1:17:29] contact the spirit realm now we know the
[1:17:32] world does a good job of that
[1:17:33] contacting the demonic realm right
[1:17:37] make some lie steal lust
[1:17:40] murder all kinds of things because
[1:17:42] they're reaching out to the demonic
[1:17:44] realm they're asking for demonic help
[1:17:47] that's basically what they're doing when
[1:17:48] they're singing
[1:17:49] but when we're singing we're praising
[1:17:50] god asking god for his holy help
[1:17:53] amen his divine help so singing is your
[1:17:57] way that's why
[1:17:58] when we sing we got to sing sincerely
[1:18:00] right we've got to sing it from our
[1:18:02] hearts
[1:18:03] or else it's not going to do us any good
[1:18:06] but if we sing sincerely it reaches out
[1:18:07] to that other realm in heaven said lord
[1:18:10] i need you jesus speak through me live
[1:18:12] through me help me jesus
[1:18:15] so singing is contacting your heavenly
[1:18:18] home
[1:18:19] we already looked at ephesians 5 right
[1:18:21] don't i'm sorry don't get drunk on wine
[1:18:23] but be filled with the spirit
[1:18:24] speaking yourselves in psalms hymns
[1:18:26] spiritual songs singing and making
[1:18:28] melody
[1:18:28] in your heart to the lord so see we
[1:18:30] gotta sing to god
[1:18:32] try to contact god and see what god
[1:18:35] would give to us
[1:18:37] what he would like us to receive
[1:18:40] but ram says this
[1:18:44] he said it's cold outside but we won't
[1:18:47] be cold
[1:18:48] inside we pray the holy spirit will just
[1:18:50] warm our hearts in such a way
[1:18:53] we'll know that his presence is so
[1:18:56] tangible look at that tangible tangible
[1:18:59] means you can feel it right
[1:19:02] i believe he's just as tangible tonight
[1:19:04] as the light is on my hands everybody
[1:19:06] look at the light on your hands
[1:19:08] just like there's light on your hands so
[1:19:12] god is here right now
[1:19:16] do you believe that he said he's just as
[1:19:18] real as the light or just as real as
[1:19:20] anything
[1:19:20] that you can touch with the five senses
[1:19:24] the five senses wasn't given to man to
[1:19:28] contact god with
[1:19:30] right five senses was given to man to
[1:19:34] contact
[1:19:35] what his earthly home
[1:19:39] we contact god by faith the sixth sense
[1:19:44] so see singing helps us contact
[1:19:47] the heavenly realm praise god
[1:19:51] this body all your five senses contacts
[1:19:53] your heavenly home
[1:19:55] but singing and open up and open up your
[1:19:57] thinking
[1:19:58] that helps you to contact the heavenly
[1:20:01] home
[1:20:01] program says we contact god by faith
[1:20:04] well where is faith
[1:20:05] faith is both in your mind and your soul
[1:20:09] right because faith is just a form of
[1:20:11] the holy spirit right it's an attribute
[1:20:14] of the holy spirit remember judas had
[1:20:17] faith but then he forfeited it
[1:20:20] he lost faith but peter had faith but he
[1:20:22] didn't lose it because jesus prayed for
[1:20:24] him praise god
[1:20:26] amen he said i'm going to pray that your
[1:20:28] faith fail not
[1:20:29] amen and of course peter had to make
[1:20:32] that you know free work free moral
[1:20:34] agency decision
[1:20:35] but jesus prayer kept him and held him
[1:20:38] in his
[1:20:38] time of great temptation and i know
[1:20:40] jesus will keep us in our time of great
[1:20:42] temptation as well
[1:20:44] praise god so your five senses contact
[1:20:46] this home
[1:20:47] but singing and worshiping in faith
[1:20:50] right
[1:20:50] that contacts your heavenly home
[1:20:55] that's why singing is so powerful
[1:20:56] especially with groups like the children
[1:20:58] choir
[1:20:59] or our or our songs here tonight it's
[1:21:02] it's all of us it's all saying god we
[1:21:03] want to contact you
[1:21:05] we want to touch you we want you to
[1:21:06] touch us praise god we want to hear from
[1:21:08] heaven hallelujah
[1:21:11] second kings 3 11. and we could read all
[1:21:15] this but most you know the story
[1:21:16] jehoshaphat and ahab's son
[1:21:20] come to elisha the prophet
[1:21:23] and they say is jehoshaphat says is not
[1:21:26] there here a prophet of the lord that we
[1:21:28] may inquire of the lord by him
[1:21:31] and elijah remember what elisha says he
[1:21:33] said i won't even listen to the ahab's
[1:21:34] son except jehoshaphat was here
[1:21:37] sounds like he's a little bit angry huh
[1:21:39] sounds like he's a little bit uh upset
[1:21:41] with ahab's son which he ought to be
[1:21:43] verse 13. verse 15. bring me now
[1:21:46] a minstrel and that's someone who can
[1:21:48] play the instrument right
[1:21:50] the hebrew actually says it's a strained
[1:21:52] instrument right but one time i preached
[1:21:54] i think somebody corrected me on that
[1:21:55] one
[1:21:57] but somebody a menstrual someone who
[1:21:59] came to play
[1:22:01] for elisha so they said
[1:22:05] how do we how do we find out god's
[1:22:08] thoughts how do we how do we contact god
[1:22:10] he said bring me somebody that can play
[1:22:11] the worship
[1:22:14] see maokai lydia how powerful you two
[1:22:16] can be
[1:22:18] people want to come to church they want
[1:22:20] to hear from god guess who's got a good
[1:22:22] guess who plays a part and helps them
[1:22:23] connect to god you guys
[1:22:27] location with your singing haven with
[1:22:28] your singing haven i see hey
[1:22:30] many times i'll see haven't stand up and
[1:22:32] raise their hands that's helping people
[1:22:34] contact god
[1:22:35] so in case you're doing it on sunday see
[1:22:37] you guys do your razors
[1:22:38] when you start reaching out to god that
[1:22:40] helps other people reach out to god
[1:22:43] and hear from god
[1:22:48] so elisha we want to hear from god he
[1:22:49] said somebody bring me
[1:22:51] a sister that can sing real good
[1:22:54] bring me a brother that can play this
[1:22:56] piano here they want to hear from god
[1:22:59] this is how we contact god it's not by
[1:23:02] going up and eating an apple
[1:23:04] oh that's okay right it's not my oh
[1:23:07] let's just go drill some more holes in
[1:23:09] the wall you know i said how you're
[1:23:10] going to contact god you got to cry out
[1:23:13] to god you got to sing to god you got to
[1:23:14] praise god
[1:23:16] you got to reach out to god with your
[1:23:19] sixth sense with your mind with your
[1:23:24] your heart your emotions
[1:23:27] and the bible said it came to pass when
[1:23:30] the minstrel played
[1:23:32] that the hand of the lord came upon him
[1:23:36] and he said thus saith the lord make
[1:23:38] this valley
[1:23:39] full of ditches remember they filled
[1:23:40] them up with water and then the enemy
[1:23:42] when they woke up the next morning they
[1:23:44] looked out they saw the water
[1:23:45] the light reflecting it made the water
[1:23:47] look like blood everybody fled
[1:23:50] and israel got the victory
[1:23:53] but how did they figure out what to do
[1:23:57] go get me somebody that can play the
[1:23:58] real songs of god that really knows how
[1:24:00] to worship
[1:24:01] we'll hear from heaven and children i
[1:24:04] believe that can happen every service
[1:24:06] god will direct us he'll speak something
[1:24:08] to us that's why your songs are so
[1:24:10] important
[1:24:12] right that's why your prayers are so
[1:24:13] more that's why how you worship is
[1:24:15] important if we're sitting like this and
[1:24:18] song service and it's boring shame on us
[1:24:23] we're actually hindering the service
[1:24:26] right
[1:24:27] go get me a minstrel go get me someone
[1:24:29] who knows how to worship someone who
[1:24:30] knows how to praise god
[1:24:32] with rejoicing and gladness and
[1:24:34] joyfulness of heart
[1:24:36] god is greatly to be praised we want to
[1:24:38] touch god we want to hear from god
[1:24:39] we got to praise the great god great god
[1:24:42] in a great manner
[1:24:44] forgive me we want to hear from the
[1:24:46] great god
[1:24:47] let's sing how great he is hallelujah
[1:24:52] see so music is an invitation channel
[1:24:56] to invite the powers of heaven to come
[1:24:59] down it's calling out
[1:25:01] for spiritual power to
[1:25:04] from god the world does it for satan's
[1:25:06] power but we call out to god it's
[1:25:08] inviting god to come
[1:25:09] and fill us with his power connecting to
[1:25:12] the spiritual world of god's holiness
[1:25:19] let's stop right there by god's grace so
