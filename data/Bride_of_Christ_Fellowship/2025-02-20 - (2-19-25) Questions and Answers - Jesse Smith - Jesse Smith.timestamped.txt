[0:00] to be in the house of the Lord
[0:04] hallelujah let's go if you would uh
[0:07] let's go just to Malachi chapter 4 5 and
[0:09] six I want to preach a little different
[0:10] topic tonight uh I want to preach on
[0:12] questions and answers I've got numerous
[0:14] questions and answers about brother
[0:15] brandom over the last few months and
[0:17] I've been kind of saving them up for a
[0:19] time I can just kind of preach them all
[0:20] together so I think I might i' like to
[0:22] do that tonight by the grace of the
[0:27] Lord so Malachi 4 5 and 6
[0:41] Malachi 45 and six here by God's
[0:49] grace very familiar to us who have
[0:52] followed brother Ram's message for any
[0:53] amount of time this is a uh prophecy
[0:55] about a Prophet Elijah to come and so uh
[0:59] this is a scripture about abam
[1:00] emphasized numerous times on numerous
[1:03] occasions even with the uh infallible
[1:05] phrase of thus sayith the
[1:08] Lord and I realized the gravity of that
[1:10] statement of course I wouldn't be
[1:11] preaching all these 18 years if I didn't
[1:13] realize the gravity of brother raham
[1:15] statements about thus sayith the Lord
[1:16] and prophecies and being a prophet
[1:19] Hallelujah now most churches you know uh
[1:21] that aren't in Pentecostal ranks they
[1:22] would just shudder if you said that you
[1:24] know oh there's a man saying thus sayith
[1:26] the Lord they would just shudder with
[1:27] that but the thing is they're just
[1:28] ignorant of the scripture praise God and
[1:30] they just they just don't know they've
[1:32] been trapped in denomination too long
[1:33] but thank God he set us free from the
[1:35] chains of denominations hallelujah amen

[2:03] have been answered through the preaching
[2:04] there I said praise God that's all God's
[2:07] grace and mercy just like it was uh the
[2:09] Bible said the holy spirit is a
[2:10] discerner of the thoughts intents of the
[2:12] heart Hallelujah so we're thankful for
[2:14] the holy spirit so I'll read verse five

[2:19] prophet before the coming of the great
[2:21] and Dreadful day of the Lord let's read

[3:17] you're being seated praise God so I'll
[3:19] be doing some teaching tonight now of
[3:21] course you know I like to do quite a bit
[3:23] of teaching but I am working on a a a
[3:26] preaching sermon here I was sharing with
[3:28] a brother uh on the mage message from
[3:30] Minnesota I was sharing him a little
[3:31] message I've been working on here uh by
[3:34] the grace of God um I'm not going to
[3:36] give it away because I want know I don't
[3:37] want you to go study it I want to be
[3:39] fresh to
[3:40] you but if you want to know ask God
[3:42] he'll let you know what I'm studying
[3:44] just going to teach on or preach on it
[3:45] just a um a preaching message here
[3:48] brother man said there's of course the
[3:49] Bible says there's preaching messages
[3:50] that just declare declare declare then
[3:52] there's teaching Ms which give you
[3:54] instruction they instruct and so with
[3:56] these questions and answers I'll
[3:57] probably just be instructing answers to
[3:59] them uh giving Bible instruction here uh
[4:02] by the grace of God so I want to get to
[4:04] my other notes here and then we'll be
[4:06] ready to go okay okay so uh the first
[4:11] one is about uh and these will be
[4:13] focusing here on brother braham's
[4:14] Ministry a little bit here tonight by
[4:16] God's grace you know um I've been
[4:18] preaching heavy on the book of
[4:19] Corinthians I think we're we just
[4:20] finished part 13 um on Sunday there so I
[4:24] just thought I'd take a little break
[4:25] here okay all right that's good that's
[4:27] I'm very thankful that worked out
[4:28] tonight here so I want to look at
[4:30] there's three questions and answers let
[4:31] me set a timer here I'll do 45 minutes
[4:33] and see if how that goes here by got the
[4:36] grace of God there was basically three
[4:38] questions that I've been asked recently
[4:40] I made videos about them and studied on
[4:41] them and so forth and so i' like to show
[4:43] uh some answers here tonight the first
[4:45] one was about uh prophets making
[4:47] predictions that didn't come to pass and
[4:50] we're just talking human predictions
[4:52] we're not talking about thus sayith the
[4:54] Lord or in the name of the Lord we're
[4:56] just talking about human predictions
[4:57] okay there's three or four examples in
[4:59] the Bible and this relates of course to
[5:01] brother Brandon making a prediction
[5:03] about
[5:03] 1977 so we'll we'll look at that here
[5:06] the second one was about all the
[5:08] preaching gifts um could a could a
[5:11] prophet have all the preaching gifts
[5:14] okay uh so there's five preaching gifts
[5:16] so the question has come up uh people
[5:18] asked me you know did brother bradam
[5:19] have all five did anyone in the Bible
[5:21] have five and so I think we can prove uh
[5:23] by the scripture and so forth uh that uh
[5:26] a preacher can have all five gifts
[5:29] brother r said he read in history now he
[5:30] didn't give the citation which I'd like
[5:32] to get it maybe Rod Knows It But brother
[5:33] Ram was talking about Martin Luther and
[5:35] brother Ram said he read somewhere that
[5:36] Martin Luther had all nine of the
[5:39] spiritual gifts you know he spoke in
[5:41] tongues he prophesied he had discernment
[5:43] Faith knowledge you know you name it all
[5:46] nine of them uh now i' I'd like that
[5:48] reference on that I don't know enough
[5:50] about Martin Luther to know that um uh
[5:53] but uh if if in other words if somebody
[5:55] could have all nine right of the regular
[5:58] gifts then that would give some evidence
[6:00] that somebody could have all five
[6:01] preaching gifts and here the r of it is
[6:03] just kind of reminded me the rout of it
[6:05] is Jesus Christ had all nine gifts and
[6:07] all five preaching gifts right he was
[6:10] the fullness of the godhead bodily in a
[6:12] man right all the he said all power and
[6:15] authority was given unto me right and he
[6:16] said I only do that which pleased the
[6:18] father and he says I only please the
[6:20] father I always please the father in
[6:22] everything I do so he had all the
[6:23] supernatural gifts remember the Bible
[6:25] said there's not enough room to put the
[6:27] books in the world of all the things
[6:28] that he did by God's Gra so surely he
[6:30] had all the gifts of the holy spirit
[6:33] okay
[6:35] so let's look at this first one uh so
[6:37] you have your Bibles ready here um we'll
[6:40] look at uh I I made a video of course it
[6:41] was last fall uh about at least there's
[6:44] four human predictions and actually one
[6:45] of them is a thus sayeth the Lord uh
[6:48] that uh that God gives and uh it's it's
[6:52] altered so it's a we'll get to that in
[6:55] just a moment with uh Isaiah and
[6:57] Hezekiah so it takes a real good balance
[6:59] in the scripture actually before we get
[7:01] that let's just read a few verses about
[7:03] prophets let's go to I believe it's
[7:04] James chapter
[7:06] 5 because it's very important to
[7:08] understand this this is where a lot of
[7:09] critics will get brother brandham wrong
[7:11] they'll criticize brother brandham uh
[7:14] unjustly but the Bible says uh to be a
[7:17] prophet um you had to speak uh something
[7:19] in the name of the Lord so it's very
[7:22] important uh we look at what people say
[7:25] that uh prophets rather that speak in
[7:27] the name of the Lord
[7:30] it's uh James
[7:36] 510 okay so uh James 5:10 says take my
[7:39] brethren the prophets who have spoken of
[7:42] in the name of the Lord for an example
[7:45] of suffering Affliction and of patience
[7:48] so Prophets You Know prophets are born
[7:51] under the human curse right and so uh
[7:54] Romans 3 talks about that human curse
[7:57] every man or woman is born and the Bible
[7:59] said job of a few days they're full of
[8:01] trouble right and the Bible says in
[8:02] Romans 3 every mouth is like a supplier
[8:05] right with dead stuff coming out so we
[8:07] know every Prophet Moses you name it uh
[8:09] Enoch John the Baptist Joshua every
[8:12] prophet of God Ezekiel Jeremiah habac
[8:15] you know Zephaniah Zechariah Malachi all
[8:18] of them at some point uttered something
[8:20] that was just human and it was wrong
[8:22] right now the Bible says everything
[8:24] Samuel said God didn't let anything fall
[8:26] to the ground well to be scriptural that
[8:27] just means with thus sayith the Lord
[8:29] right because no man or I'm sorry all
[8:32] men have fallen short of the glory of
[8:33] God right so a statement like that must
[8:36] be balanced out with the word of God
[8:37] that means because the Bible said in
[8:39] Romans 3 everybody speaks lies everybody
[8:40] speaks uh uh uh evil things the Bible
[8:43] says that Romans chapter 3 uh a lie or
[8:46] something like that some something
[8:47] deceptive the Bible said the heart is
[8:49] deceitfully wicked Above All Things who
[8:51] can know it right and where do the where
[8:52] do the words come from the abundance of
[8:54] the heart the Bible says Jesus says that
[8:56] so uh sometimes people utter things well
[8:59] many times people utter things without
[9:01] understanding they'll falsely accuse a
[9:02] prophet of God and so we must make the
[9:05] scripture Our absolute and uh so a
[9:08] prophet must speak in the name of the
[9:10] Lord they must predict something in the
[9:12] name of the Lord not just I predict this
[9:13] or I predict that but it has to be in
[9:15] the name of the Lord now let's go to
[9:17] Deuteronomy 18 these are foundational
[9:18] scriptures for a
[9:20] prophet and it is true the uh a prophet
[9:23] cannot get one thing wrong in the name
[9:25] of the
[9:26] Lord if they do that would mean they're
[9:28] a false prophet
[9:30] Deuteronomy 18 and that's why I've gone
[9:32] through every time brother Ram said in
[9:34] the name of the Lord thus sayith the
[9:35] Lord there's over thousand of them I
[9:38] think there's over 12200 maybe 1100 some
[9:40] I'm guilty of exaggerating sometimes so
[9:42] um but I've gone through all uh let's
[9:44] say 1100 okay I'll just keep it on the
[9:46] lower end I know there's over a thousand
[9:48] and I've gone through every one of those
[9:50] that was in 2017 I went through every
[9:52] single I read every single one and I've
[9:55] not found one where brother Ram failed
[9:57] where God let it fall to the ground
[9:58] everyone's comeing to pass now there's
[10:00] times he's talking about stories of thus
[10:02] sayith the Lord and he might get a fact
[10:04] here there wrong but that wasn't the
[10:06] exact moment he was prophesying and so
[10:08] again you got to look at when when is a
[10:09] man actually prophesying not just
[10:11] telling a story about a prophecy because
[10:13] we all forget things right the older you
[10:15] get seem to forget a little more
[10:17] right we just forget details about
[10:19] things but you got to look at what's the
[10:21] point the prophet is saying what's or
[10:23] what's the point of the story that he's
[10:25] saying okay so uh that's what I found in
[10:28] my studies now let's go down down to
[10:29] verse 20 God uh of course God tells the
[10:33] the the Israel that this is the test of
[10:35] the prophets brother Ram Echoes this he
[10:36] actually used these same words as
[10:37] scoffield scoffield calls us the test of
[10:39] the Prophet CI scoffield um by verse 20
[10:44] but here's the test verse 20 but the
[10:46] prophet which shall res presume to speak
[10:48] a word in my name which I've not
[10:50] commanded him to speak or that shall
[10:51] speak in the name of other gods even
[10:53] that Prophet shall die so that's why
[10:56] it's very important a true prophet of
[10:58] God will only speak in in the name of
[10:59] the Lord now you and I would think oh
[11:02] how would you know well it's it's just a
[11:03] gift it's so simple the Bible said God
[11:06] will speak to them in dreams or visions
[11:07] but like Moses it was like lip to ear I
[11:10] think it was face to face or mouth to
[11:11] mouth I think is said there in the book
[11:13] of numbers in other words a prophet has
[11:15] such a special gift a such a special
[11:17] channel that they're not going to miss
[11:19] God won't allow them to miss Hallelujah
[11:22] God's got to have a witness God's got to
[11:23] have a prophet who cannot miss because
[11:26] of their predestinated gift of God
[11:28] hallelujah
[11:30] now verse 21 and if thou say in thine
[11:32] heart how shall we know the word which
[11:34] the Lord hath not spoken very simple
[11:36] right verse 22 when a prophet speaketh
[11:39] in the name of the Lord if the thing
[11:40] follow not nor come to pass that is the
[11:43] thing which the Lord hath not spoken but
[11:45] the prophet has spoken it presumptuously
[11:47] or from his own heart right not from the
[11:49] mind of God Thou shalt not be afraid of
[11:52] him so don't fear that man that's not a
[11:54] that's not a true Prophet now the best
[11:56] example was in 2020 all these uh
[11:58] charismatic uh mega church preachers
[12:01] almost all of them predicted Trump would
[12:02] get two consecutive terms and he didn't
[12:05] get it even if they stole it he still
[12:07] didn't get two consecutive terms and
[12:09] they said the Lord told him that
[12:10] automatically that proves their false
[12:12] prophets and so don't fear them and I
[12:14] got a whole list them if you want to
[12:16] talk about after service I've kept the
[12:18] videos you know so you have to you know
[12:20] the Bible said Mark them that cause
[12:22] division right you got to mark them uh
[12:26] and of course you know uh there's just a
[12:28] long long list of
[12:29] but we don't follow them thank God God
[12:31] showed us the truth hallelujah now it
[12:33] it's always easy to know that's one
[12:34] thing but also they have many false
[12:36] doctrines you know like they let women
[12:38] preach and they uh they would let women
[12:40] wear makeup and sexy clothes and sexual
[12:43] things like sexual immorality like that
[12:45] let them marry two three four times when
[12:46] the Bible said it's adultery so in other
[12:48] words they have many corrupt fruits not
[12:50] just one corrupt fruit right so it's
[12:52] it's it's not something that would
[12:53] deceive us but it would deceive people
[12:55] who aren't really into the word right
[12:57] they they haven't dug deep down to the
[12:59] Deep things of God because the spirit
[13:01] searches all things yay the Deep things
[13:03] of
[13:04] God so if someone is really in touch
[13:06] with the Holy Ghost they will get deep
[13:08] down into the word of God it won't just
[13:09] be a surface understanding it'll be a
[13:11] real deep revelation of the word of God
[13:14] hallelujah so that's the foundation a
[13:17] prophet has to speak in the name so they
[13:19] have to say in the name of the Lord or
[13:20] in the name of Jesus or in the name uh
[13:23] of God Almighty or something along those
[13:24] lines in the Old Testament it was thus
[13:26] sayith the Lord but now in the New
[13:27] Testament now we know the name of the
[13:28] Lord It's the Lord Lord Jesus Christ so
[13:30] a new testament Prophet could say in the
[13:31] name of Jesus Christ all right now let's
[13:35] read these here uh 1st Samuel 27 there's
[13:37] at least four examples
[13:39] here 1st Samuel 27 1
[13:47] through3 and David said in his heart I
[13:49] shall now perish One Day by the hand of
[13:52] Saul Church did he die by the hand of
[13:54] Saul no he died of old age there is
[13:58] nothing better for me that I should
[14:00] speedily Escape into the land of the
[14:02] Philistines and Saul shall despair of me
[14:04] to seek me anymore in any coast of
[14:06] Israel so I shall Escape out of his hand
[14:08] now this was spoken in his heart but
[14:09] what did God do God allowed it to be
[14:11] read before everybody right now to let
[14:15] us know that prophets can have things in
[14:16] their heart they think that they're
[14:18] right right but they're they they're not
[14:22] it's not God's thought it's the
[14:23] prophet's own thought right just like
[14:26] Nathan I don't have this on the list but
[14:27] remember Nathan said David do all that's
[14:29] in your heart and what did God say
[14:31] Nathan go down and tell him no he's not
[14:33] going to build the house in other words
[14:34] God's like no Nathan he's not going to
[14:36] do all that's in his heart Hallelujah so
[14:39] a prophet doesn't tell God what to do a
[14:41] prophet doesn't do what he say what he
[14:44] thinks you know with the name of the
[14:45] Lord he waits till God tells him then he
[14:47] speaks it praise God now just so you
[14:50] know David was a prophet a minor one
[14:52] right we would say you know we're not
[14:54] saying this is th thus sayi the Lord but
[14:56] there was Major Prophets and Minor
[14:57] Prophets now David looks like a major
[14:59] prophet because he prophesied of the
[15:00] death of Jesus Christ on the cross but
[15:04] you can see in his life though there was
[15:06] other prophets he submitted to like like
[15:08] Nathan right so see you got to it's just
[15:11] you know we're just trying our best to
[15:13] understand and we're trying to give
[15:14] labels you know people that were Major
[15:16] Prophets and then Minor Prophets like
[15:18] we're going to get to the example of
[15:19] Jonah who knows how many how many
[15:21] prophecies did Jonah have come to pass
[15:23] in the Bible anybody
[15:24] know one one now if you yeah you got the
[15:29] one if you want you could do two I I'll
[15:30] take that good one we'll get to that in
[15:33] a little bit I'll take that because if
[15:35] you consider the the one about Nineveh
[15:37] that warning if you consider that one
[15:38] yeah then yes that that counts too but
[15:40] there's one church we have I have
[15:42] brother random at least six and there's
[15:44] probably more that I just need to
[15:45] research more six from Brother Braham
[15:47] now that's good but think about think
[15:49] about Jeremiah Isaiah and Ezekiel I've
[15:51] just read I'm almost through Isaiah now
[15:53] I've read through all these they have
[15:54] scores of
[15:56] prophecies that thus sayi the Lord came
[15:59] to pass I mean they prophesied about
[16:00] Israel then they prophesied about Edom
[16:03] and Assyria and Babylon and Egypt like
[16:05] it's like thus say the Lord to everybody
[16:06] thus say the lord it's just like the
[16:08] just scores and scores of thus say the
[16:10] Lords so how do we know whether to call
[16:12] somebody major or minor so I'm just
[16:13] giving you an example in other words
[16:15] what I mean is there's Major Prophets
[16:16] that told many important events and then
[16:18] there's prophets that just told a few
[16:20] events does that make sense I'm not
[16:23] trying to confuse anybody but the word
[16:25] Major Prophets not in the Bible or that
[16:27] phrase the phrase minor Prophet is in
[16:29] the Bible we just call them major books
[16:32] right in the Old Testament the first few
[16:33] books then we call the rest of them
[16:34] Minor Prophets but Church let's just be
[16:36] honest you know that uh I don't think
[16:38] any Prophet wants to be called minor
[16:40] right or we as Believers we shouldn't
[16:42] take any of their prophecies in a minor
[16:44] way that's what I mean we should put uh
[16:47] equal emphasis on every prophecy because
[16:51] heaven and earth will pass away but
[16:52] God's word will never pass away
[16:55] hallelujah amen think about that it's
[16:56] easier for heaven and earth to pass away
[16:58] than for one word of God to to fail to
[17:00] come to pass amen hallelujah and one
[17:03] word of God will never come will never
[17:05] fail to come to pass Hallelujah forgive
[17:07] me let me get my words right here let's
[17:09] read that acts 2:29 and3 just so you can
[17:12] see David was a
[17:13] prophet he's the one that prophesied of
[17:16] the Resurrection in Psalm chapter 16 but
[17:18] we're just going to read Acts 2 I've
[17:20] always loved that when I preach out
[17:21] years ago God hid the resurrection from
[17:24] Satan in one half of one verse in psalm
[17:27] 16
[17:29] Satan didn't Satan Satan didn't know the
[17:31] Messiah was going to raise from the dead
[17:33] but it was hidden in the language of his
[17:36] body shall not see corruption Hallelujah
[17:39] glory to God Acts 2
[17:42] 29-30 and then we'll we might as well go
[17:44] to Jonah next because that's that's what
[17:46] Malachi had a good good thought on that
[17:48] 29 men and Brethren let me speak freely
[17:50] unto you of the patriarch David that
[17:52] he's both dead and buried and his
[17:54] supplier is with us unto this day
[17:56] therefore being a what Prophet so said
[18:00] the Bible does say minor Bible doesn't
[18:01] say major hey church he wrote a lot of
[18:03] Psalms too that were prophetic right
[18:06] lots of them
[18:08] Hallelujah so he's a prophet and knowing
[18:11] that God had sworn with an oath to him
[18:13] that the fruit of his loins according to
[18:15] the flesh he would raise up Christ to
[18:16] sit on the throne this is how David knew
[18:18] he was going to defeat Goliath church
[18:20] God must have shown him a vision because
[18:23] remember he said today I'm going to take
[18:24] your head off how did he know that all
[18:26] he had was a sling God had to showed him
[18:28] before hand Hallelujah he was a
[18:31] prophet right that's what Jes even Jesus
[18:33] you know Jesus had that prophetic gift
[18:35] Jesus said I only do that which the
[18:37] father shows me so brother Chris that
[18:39] that's how it was God would show Jesus
[18:41] to go raise Lazarus from the dead then
[18:43] he would go do it he only did what God
[18:46] showed him first that's all a prophet
[18:48] can do he doesn't do things he wants to
[18:51] do he does what God shows him to
[18:53] do Hallelujah that's how a real Prophet
[18:56] operates
[18:59] okay so David makes this prediction
[19:01] Saul's going to kill me did it come to
[19:03] pass no it's just a human prediction was
[19:06] it spoken in the name of the Lord no no
[19:09] so see that's why it's okay sometimes
[19:11] prophets can speak uh just their own
[19:13] prophecies or their own predictions and
[19:15] they don't come to pass no big deal the
[19:18] thing is church a real Christian a real
[19:20] Christian knows what to major on and
[19:22] knows what to minor on see it's the
[19:25] spirit of idolatry that wants to make
[19:27] every word of brother brandom thus
[19:29] sayith the Lord that's an evil spirit of
[19:31] idolatry they make every human word he
[19:33] said thus sayith the Lord right that
[19:36] that's a current evil spirit it's a
[19:37] spirit of idolatry right and and and
[19:40] that can be applied to anybody who says
[19:42] they're a prophet right uh anyone who
[19:44] worships and and thinks every word a
[19:47] person utters is thus say the lord
[19:48] they're deceived they have an evil
[19:49] spirit on them because only the words
[19:52] that have thus sayith the Lord right or
[19:55] in the name of the Lord those are the
[19:56] only ones that we know for sure are
[19:58] prophetic now could there be other ones
[20:00] yes there could be other words that were
[20:01] prophetic but we don't know unless the
[20:03] spirit of God leads us to know all right
[20:07] because just just like uh just like
[20:09] psalm 16 does Psalm 16 start out as thus
[20:11] sayith the Lord no it
[20:13] doesn't right good brother see it does
[20:16] so not every time does a prophetic word
[20:19] have to have thus say the Lord see but
[20:23] for us to know God says God says for us
[20:27] to know a true Prophet they will speak
[20:29] in my name and it will come to pass and
[20:31] it will never
[20:34] fail
[20:37] Glory all right now Jonah 34 this one
[20:40] good one Malachi had here good Jonah
[20:45] 3:4 I'm gonna have some people read here
[20:47] by God's gra uh Haven get Second Kings
[20:52] 1425 that's the one other prophecy that
[20:56] Jonah is recorded as prophesying
[20:59] 2 Kings 14:25 I hope I got wrote down
[21:02] the right one here so uh Jonah
[21:10] 3:4 all right let me look at up
[21:13] here Jonah 34 let me pull that up
[21:17] here thank you for your patience here
[21:20] now this one uh brother Malachi is
[21:21] talking about and Jonah began to enter
[21:23] into the city a Day's Journey and he
[21:25] cried and said yet 40 days and Nineveh
[21:27] shall be over Throne now if you just
[21:29] look at the words does he give any out
[21:32] like does he give any way say well
[21:34] unless you repent just just what it
[21:37] records now if we don't add to the word
[21:39] or take from the word like the Bible
[21:41] tells us not to
[21:43] right if we don't add to it it just
[21:45] looks like he's making a prediction you
[21:47] got 40 days no no he just he said 40
[21:50] days and you're going to be destroyed
[21:51] there's no real prediction in there or
[21:53] there's there's no uh plea for
[21:55] repentance and we know that because
[21:57] Jonah later gets mad God did spare them
[22:00] God get Jonah gets mad at God a prophet
[22:03] getting mad at
[22:04] God God's got to Humble
[22:07] Jona sometimes even prophets can uh see
[22:10] prophets can sin right they can get
[22:12] prideful all right now but see this is a
[22:15] just as it's recorded it's a prediction
[22:17] that actually didn't come to
[22:19] pass right if you just look at it now
[22:22] was it prophetic uh did did it seem like
[22:25] they had some type of awareness it was a
[22:27] prophet yes now brother tell tells the
[22:28] story I need to find it though as far as
[22:30] history brother said those ninevites
[22:32] which were Assyrians right they were
[22:34] part of the Assyrian
[22:36] Empire brother Ram said uh one of their
[22:38] main Gods was the fish God and so when
[22:41] they saw Jonah spit up out of the
[22:44] fish then they thought Oh Our God is
[22:47] sending a message to us and that's why
[22:49] they believed it now I found some other
[22:51] historical things where it said there
[22:52] was an eclipse and and so there was
[22:54] Eclipse before Jonah got there and so
[22:56] they knew like they were superstitious
[22:58] and they thought that was judgment uh
[22:59] all the politics around them was
[23:01] crumbling and so they were shaken up
[23:03] there were a time where they were shaken
[23:04] up historically and then so when God
[23:07] said in the prophet they were already
[23:08] shaken up and they were willing to
[23:10] repent think about that willing to
[23:12] repent and lay in dust in ashes my
[23:16] goodness make the animals lay in dust
[23:18] and Ashes that's how serious they took
[23:19] thus sayith the
[23:20] Lord but here do we does it actually say
[23:23] thus sayith the Lord no and did those
[23:26] exact words come to pass no because it
[23:30] says yet 40 days and Nineveh shall be
[23:32] overthrown it doesn't say unless you
[23:34] repent okay so I'm just giving you the
[23:37] basic Bible words now was Jonah a
[23:39] prophet yes Haven read that second Kings
[23:42] what' I say uh 1425
[24:02] yeah I don't know that's pretty
[24:04] good
[24:06] Hallelujah so all as we know before
[24:08] Jonah went to Nineveh was he had one
[24:10] time and that's what the The Sight and
[24:11] Sound did a good job on that movie one
[24:13] time he stood up and he said he was
[24:15] speaking as a prophet he said thus
[24:16] sayeth the Lord God's going to give us
[24:18] Victory on the North the East and the
[24:21] southeast thus sayith the Lord we'll get
[24:23] our borders back and they went and did
[24:25] it and so like on the show it's really
[24:27] everybody's CL for oh the prophet Jonah
[24:29] we got a prophet Among Us and Jonah's
[24:31] just trying to be humble like well God
[24:33] just told me what was going to happen if
[24:35] you've seen Sight and Sound it's a
[24:36] really good show but that that's that's
[24:38] all we have in the scripture one time he
[24:40] said thus sayi the Lord and it came to
[24:42] pass now you want to consider Nineveh I
[24:45] I'll go with you on that because we
[24:47] don't maybe know the exact words on
[24:49] there but it they they must have known
[24:51] it was a prophet you know they must have
[24:53] known uh to repent it was God the god of
[24:56] Heaven speaking them warning them death
[24:58] or repentance but just the way it's
[25:01] worded I'm just I'm just showing the
[25:03] other side just the way it's worded it
[25:05] doesn't give and out of repentance okay
[25:09] now here's the real real uh just
[25:13] sometimes it's a difficult one to
[25:14] understand 2 Kings 20
[25:19] 1-5 because we know the Bible said uh I
[25:22] am the Lord I change not right uh and
[25:25] God will never change that which goes
[25:27] out of his mouth 2 Kings
[25:33] 21-5 so I put this on the same level as
[25:37] uh God telling Moses uh separate
[25:41] yourself from them I'm going to kill
[25:42] them and it's God allowing man to have
[25:47] to to play the part of a type of Christ
[25:50] that's what I put on here uh this is
[25:52] what I believe because God said I'm
[25:53] going to do it I'm going to start all
[25:55] over I'm going to start with Aaron and
[25:56] Moses or Moses and Aaron and I'm going
[25:57] to start a new people and what does
[25:59] Moses and Aaron do they fall in their
[26:00] face say no God have mercy on them right
[26:02] it gives them a chance to intercede like
[26:04] Christ a high priest right iny when when
[26:08] people deserve to die somebody stands in
[26:10] the Gap and God shows grace and mercy on
[26:12] people
[26:13] hallelujah and now this story though is
[26:17] just such an amazing story in those days
[26:19] was Hezekiah sicken to death and the
[26:21] prophet Isaiah the son of Amos came to
[26:23] him and said thus sayith the Lord set
[26:25] thine house in order for Thou shalt die
[26:27] and not live he says not live right you
[26:32] will not live you're GNA die now
[26:35] remember this we showed you this a few
[26:37] weeks ago it would have been better for
[26:38] Hezekiah to die because he had two sons
[26:40] and one of his sons did the very worst
[26:42] sins according to the Bible of all the
[26:44] kings of Israel it would have been
[26:46] better not to have two boys yeah Manassa
[26:49] good brother good that's the name I was
[26:50] going
[26:51] remember good Bible reader brother
[26:54] manasse was an awful King and it was
[26:56] actually his sins that led to Babylon
[26:58] and Assyria coming in and spreading out
[27:00] because it just was the Tipping
[27:02] Point but God looked at his heart and he
[27:04] served God all those years and God knew
[27:06] what he was going to ask for and the
[27:07] church said like God knew like God
[27:09] wasn't surprised oh I'm going to change
[27:11] my thus say the Lord no it was God
[27:13] allowing him uh to express his desires
[27:16] it's God showing him
[27:18] Mercy right because he's a pure-hearted
[27:20] servant he says thus say imagine brother
[27:23] dramatized imagine being Isaiah thus
[27:25] sayith the Lord You're not live you die
[27:28] you're walking out and God stops say oh
[27:30] no go back and tell him he's going to
[27:31] live oh God what oh God's going to give
[27:35] a different
[27:37] word right but so he's got to go back
[27:39] and say well no you actually you got 15
[27:41] years to live I've heard your
[27:43] prayer so this this is a great lesson
[27:46] for us it shows God's mercy to his
[27:49] Faithful
[27:50] Servants and it shows these two things
[27:52] it shows the perfect will of God and the
[27:54] permissive will of God we also saw it
[27:56] with
[27:56] balum bam made Seven sacrifices remember
[27:59] he sacrif sacrificed seven altars and
[28:01] and seven Bullocks and he says can I go
[28:03] up with Bao and God said no he goes back
[28:06] and says okay Bao I can't go he says go
[28:08] try again you got to try again with
[28:11] God he goes back again he says can I go
[28:13] God says go go ahead and go what God
[28:16] changed his mind but uh but but we know
[28:19] from the scripture it's God allowing the
[28:22] false prophet to have his heart's desire
[28:25] God's not going to force you to do
[28:26] something he'll tell you what to do but
[28:27] he's not going going to force you and so
[28:30] with balam just like with Hezekiah it's
[28:32] God allowing Hezekiah to have the
[28:33] permissive will of God just like balum
[28:37] got the permissive will of God he had
[28:38] the perfect will of God first he should
[28:40] have took the perfect will of God and
[28:41] the church said and that's how people do
[28:44] today you know uh I'll just use an
[28:45] example it doesn't impact our church but
[28:47] someone will get married right and then
[28:49] they'll something bad will happen
[28:50] they'll want a divorce you know and it
[28:52] doesn't happen in this church it's never
[28:53] happened in this church but uh the
[28:55] perfect will of God would be to stay
[28:57] with that person work it out
[28:59] forgive right but then they they'll pray
[29:02] and church maybe God would allow them to
[29:04] do something like Mary again and they
[29:05] would say God told me but that wasn't
[29:08] God's first will just like with balam
[29:11] Hallelujah it wasn't the first will of
[29:14] God like brother BR said brother said
[29:16] one time a woman told me a God told me
[29:18] to preach and brother BR said I don't
[29:20] doubt that one bit but that wasn't the
[29:22] first thing God told
[29:25] you the first thing God would have told
[29:27] you is go read first Timothy chapter 3
[29:29] Hallelujah I'm sorry chapter two sorry
[29:31] it's not chapter three chapter two right
[29:35] I suffer not a woman to preach or teach
[29:37] up to a
[29:39] man so see I I don't doubt uh that maybe
[29:42] God told Joseph Ram to play The Taste
[29:44] but that wasn't the first thing God told
[29:46] Joseph brandom because the first thing
[29:48] he would told him was already said in
[29:50] the
[29:51] word
[29:53] right so see that's why it takes a real
[29:57] spirit LED Christian to rightly divide
[29:59] things that happen in life think about
[30:02] that all these people could have come
[30:03] back and said Isaiah is not a prophet
[30:05] because he said thus say the Lord he's
[30:06] going to die oh but now he's going to
[30:08] live what how how could God change his
[30:12] mind it wasn't God changing his mind it
[30:14] was God allowing Hezekiah to have the
[30:16] permissive will of
[30:17] God God knew what Hezekiah would do God
[30:20] knew what balam would do God knew what
[30:22] Moses would do and Aaron because they
[30:24] did the right
[30:25] thing think about that Temptation
[30:27] brother you know
[30:28] God said I'm going to start a brand new
[30:29] family with you're going to be the next
[30:31] Abraham and Moses could have thought oh
[30:34] my that that sounds pretty good but
[30:36] instead he's like no God don't destroy
[30:38] them have mercy on them and God said
[30:39] good that's just like my son Jesus is
[30:41] going to do H he's going to intercede
[30:44] for the Sinners
[30:45] Hallelujah so it's a great lesson here
[30:48] verse two and he turned his face to the
[30:50] wall praying to the Lord and saying I
[30:51] beseech thee Oh Lord remember now how
[30:53] I've walked before thee in truth and
[30:55] with a perfect heart now notice God
[30:57] never Rees him he walked with a perfect
[31:00] heart that means just confessing sins
[31:01] every day because no man is perfect
[31:03] right you just you to take care of your
[31:04] sins every day and the church said at
[31:06] the end of the day before you go to bed
[31:08] confess all your sins don't let the sun
[31:10] go down upon your wrath because no man
[31:12] is perfect of their own ability if
[31:14] that's the case why do we need Jesus we
[31:16] need Jesus to forgive all our
[31:21] sins I'm going to skip down verse four
[31:24] and it came to pass a four Isaiah was
[31:25] gone out in the middle of the Court he
[31:27] didn't even get out out the middle of
[31:28] the king's court he just made it out of
[31:30] the the the the the court and then he
[31:32] goes to the middle court the second
[31:33] court and now the Lord stops him says go
[31:36] back I got a I got a permissive will of
[31:38] God for him go back and tell him
[31:43] this right he says turn again and tell
[31:46] Hezekiah verse 5 the captain of my
[31:47] people thus sayith the Lord the god of
[31:48] David thy father I have heard thy prayer
[31:50] I've seen thy tears behold I will heal
[31:51] thee so he's not going to die right away
[31:54] but God just said he was going to die it
[31:56] was a test
[31:59] behold I will heal thee on the third day
[32:01] Thou shalt go up unto the house of the
[32:03] Lord and remember he gives him the sign
[32:04] where he God actually stops time God
[32:06] turns back
[32:08] time God made the sun stand still for
[32:10] Joshua God turned back time for Hezekiah
[32:14] nothing is too hard for the Lord how
[32:15] many would like God to turn back a few
[32:17] years on your clock I'd like to go back
[32:18] a few more years I got too much gray
[32:19] here brother
[32:21] R anything think he only got three days
[32:23] or something like that it wasn't that
[32:24] much time but God turned back the time
[32:27] now here's the last one now this is uh
[32:29] it doesn't actually say Apostles it just
[32:30] says the Brethren but it's possible some
[32:32] of the Apostles thought that John was
[32:35] going to live to the coming the second
[32:37] coming of Christ John
[32:41] 21:21 oh
[32:51] man all right I'm getting there by God's
[32:54] grace pardon me it's taking me a little
[32:55] bit longer to get to them uh Peter
[32:58] seeing him saith to Jesus Lord what
[33:00] shall this man do Jesus saith unto him
[33:02] if I will that he T till I come what is
[33:04] that to thee follow me we get a good
[33:06] lesson there don't worry about other
[33:08] people's Ministries you be faithful with
[33:10] yours what's John going to do what
[33:12] what's brother so- and so what's this
[33:14] going to do Focus On Christ don't worry
[33:16] about other people do what God called
[33:18] you to do Hallelujah verse 23 then went
[33:22] out this saying abroad among the
[33:24] Brethren that the disciples should not
[33:25] die yet Jesus said not unto him he shall
[33:27] not die but if I will that he ter till I
[33:30] come what is that to thee and we know
[33:32] John died about 100 AD right of old age
[33:35] he's the only apostle that wasn't
[33:36] martyred or
[33:38] killed the Apostle of Love okay but look
[33:42] there's a saying amongst all these
[33:43] brothers oh my goodness we're predicting
[33:45] John's gonna live Jesus said what is it
[33:48] if he live till I come so there's a
[33:50] we're predicting John's John's not going
[33:52] to die before the Lord gets here let's
[33:54] hang around John who would have been
[33:55] hanging around John I probably would
[33:56] have been hanging around joh let's be
[33:57] honest I would have been there
[33:58] uh John can I uh be your neighbor
[34:00] brother wherever you go I'm going to go
[34:02] because I know you're going to be ready
[34:03] for the Rapture right and there's people
[34:06] that still think John's alive to this
[34:07] day hiding out in some cave what a bunch
[34:09] of
[34:09] nonsense because they misunderstand this
[34:12] they don't and it just shows and these
[34:14] are the same people that make the false
[34:15] prophecies like the one guy said Biden
[34:17] he said thus he said the Lord told me
[34:19] thus say the Lord Biden won't even
[34:20] finish out his first term he
[34:22] did well no wonder this guy got he and
[34:24] then he got caught in sexual sin see is
[34:25] that all those Spirits go together
[34:29] all those evil spirits go together you
[34:30] get one evil spirit lying Spirit then
[34:32] you get a sexual lust of the flesh
[34:34] spirit and all these all these demon
[34:35] powers right if they don't clean it out
[34:36] the leaven just grows and it infects
[34:38] their whole life thank God for the
[34:41] unleavened bread of the word of God
[34:43] hallelujah thank God Amen we can have
[34:45] pure lives
[34:46] Hallelujah all right now now the reason
[34:49] I say that is because brother R said
[34:50] this now remember 19 times he says this
[34:54] 1977 prediction was a prediction I
[34:56] counted I went back counted 19 times he
[35:00] says I'm not prophesying 19 times he
[35:02] says this is not in the name of the Lord
[35:04] I just have three reasons now he didn't
[35:05] say that I found that but basically I
[35:08] got three reasons I think the Lord's
[35:10] going to come uh before 1977 this is in
[35:13] 1956 said remember I predict that before
[35:16] the great total Annihilation which I
[35:17] don't say the Lord told me this so see
[35:19] plainly God didn't tell me this I'm not
[35:21] speaking this in his name I believe
[35:23] there'll be something happened either
[35:24] between now or that time of 77 it may
[35:27] come at this hour but between now and 77
[35:29] I predict that either a great
[35:30] destruction or total annihilation of the
[35:31] entire Earth between now and 77 I
[35:33] predicted it in 1933 now this stumbles a
[35:36] lot of people which I understand why if
[35:38] you haven't read more of the
[35:40] Bible but you have to know a real
[35:42] Prophet they have to say in the name of
[35:44] the Lord or thus sayith the Lord there
[35:47] was a lot of predictions going like
[35:48] around like this the time of brother
[35:49] Bram uh Charles Tes Russell Uriah Smith
[35:52] they were all making all these
[35:53] prophecies I'm sorry some were making
[35:55] predictions right some were making
[35:57] predictions some were making false
[35:58] prophecies but notice brother plainly
[36:01] says I don't say this and there's a
[36:02] quote where brother said I didn't see
[36:04] 1977 in my vision of the seven major
[36:06] Visions I'll show that he said I didn't
[36:09] see 1977 in there he had three reasons
[36:11] why it was a prediction he said no
[36:13] democracy had lasted 200 years so he
[36:15] went he looked at 19 or 1776 plus 200
[36:18] was 1976 so that's one reason I got it
[36:21] on tape if you want to hear it and then
[36:23] he said the 70th Israeli Jubilee uh now
[36:26] what's I did this on my watch here
[36:28] 70 time
[36:30] 50 I got to change this here I I did the
[36:33] total number here 7 what's 70 somebody
[36:37] somebody
[36:39] probably I don't know let me
[36:42] try yeah brother 3,500 this guy's on
[36:45] he's on tonight he got good sleep last
[36:48] night so brother randam uh did that math
[36:52] now let's minus that uh 1977 so brother
[36:55] Ram scoffield Bible said the first first
[36:58] the first Jubilee that Moses spoke of
[37:00] was in 1523 BC and brother raham went
[37:04] and did the math he's like okay well
[37:06] well then the 70th Jubilee where uh that
[37:09] means uh Jesus uh Christ God bless you
[37:11] sir Jesus Christ will reveal himself to
[37:13] the Jews right and the blindness will
[37:15] fall off them like Paul talks about
[37:16] Romans 11 uh brother found that date it
[37:20] must have been uh in the Scofield bible
[37:21] or Usher he used Usher as a historian
[37:24] he's like oh that goes to 1977 the 70th
[37:28] Jubilee and third brother calculated
[37:31] that from Abraham to Jesus's Ascension
[37:35] Resurrection was 19 uh 19 1954 years
[37:41] okay so he again he used his Bible he's
[37:44] doing math
[37:45] calculations and then he's like oh well
[37:47] then uh from 33 ad or whatever it was 30
[37:50] ad uh plus plus the rest of the year so
[37:53] whatever the year was that Jesus
[37:54] resurrected I don't know the exact year
[37:56] plus 50 1954 was
[37:59] 1977 so brother R thought he had three
[38:01] reasons and that's why he called it
[38:03] divine inspiration but he never said
[38:05] thus sayith the
[38:06] Lord okay he never said he said plainly
[38:09] I don't say the Lord told me this okay
[38:12] but clearly right clearly prophets can
[38:15] people can predict things but if it's
[38:16] not spoken in the name of the Lord you
[38:18] can't make it let it's in the name of
[38:19] the Lord don't put something in
[38:21] someone's mouth you'll know if it's thus
[38:24] say the Lord you'll hear it it's thus
[38:25] sayith the Lord hallelujah that's how
[38:27] God speaks to his people just read the
[38:29] book of Ezekiel and Jeremiah my goodness
[38:31] why don't people read their Bibles I
[38:33] mean ezekiel's like all the time thus
[38:34] sayith the Lord thus sayith the Lord he
[38:35] says son of man give them thus sayith
[38:37] the Lord Jeremiah's like thus sayith the
[38:38] Lord anytime God's going to speak he's
[38:40] going to say this is me
[38:42] speaking okay through a prophet all
[38:45] right so that's the first question now
[38:47] how am I doing on time that was a long
[38:49] time okay okay so I got 30 I've already
[38:52] been going 35 minutes okay second
[38:54] question here now this a let's see oh
[38:57] all the preaching gifts
[39:00] okay let me uh I got to pull up those
[39:03] notes
[39:07] here
[39:10] okay there it is okay now let's let's
[39:15] show how Paul Paul we can prove by the
[39:17] Bible Paul had at least four and then if
[39:20] you look at another verse it's clear he
[39:22] had all five gifts okay so let's get
[39:25] some readers here uh you want to read
[39:27] there n brother brother Rod okay uh
[39:28] brother Rod Romans 1:1 pretty easy to
[39:31] find there first chapter first verse uh
[39:33] nature do you want to get 1
[39:34] Thessalonians 4 15 16 and
[39:39] 17 and then Caris do you want to get uh
[39:41] 1 Timothy
[39:45] 2:7 uh brother Chris do you want to get
[39:47] one yeah you want to get uh acts
[39:51] 1536 so we can prove by the Bible Paul
[39:53] had at least four preaching gifts okay
[39:56] so brother R why don't you start with
[39:57] ROM Romans
[40:06] 1:1 amen hallelujah glory to God what is
[40:09] he he's an apostle what does Apostle
[40:11] mean one cent one cent forth that's
[40:14] right so that's a missionary we called a
[40:16] missionary to I don't know why they
[40:17] changed the name but said why do they
[40:18] want a missionary name he said I like
[40:19] the Apostle word better me too I'm with
[40:22] your brother
[40:23] B okay so he's an apostle uh now yeah uh
[40:29] nature here he now this doesn't call
[40:32] Paul a prophet but he speaks in the name
[40:34] of the Lord predicting future events
[40:35] that makes it a prophet so 1
[40:37] Thessalonians 4:1 1516 and 17 nature
[41:14] all right Hallelujah I feel like
[41:15] clapping let's clap
[41:17] for two claps a rod so on our Sunday
[41:20] night bible I encourage the kids and we
[41:22] clap for them like saying hey great job
[41:23] keep up the good reading I just find a
[41:25] way to encourage them publicly
[41:27] Caris uh what did I say 1 Timothy 2:7
[41:30] Caris that what it
[41:45] say oh give it to your class great job
[41:47] so so we got three we got Apostle
[41:49] Prophet remember he said I speak by the
[41:51] word of the Lord this is going to happen
[41:53] shout voice Trump so shall we ever be
[41:55] with the Lord by the word of the Lord
[41:56] not by by his word the word Lord and we
[41:59] just preached through 1 Corinthians 7
[42:01] right and he says this is me this is not
[42:02] the Lord now this is a command from the
[42:04] Lord right so if you know your
[42:06] scriptures and then Peter said Paul
[42:08] writes some deep th things he said and
[42:10] the the people that don't understand it
[42:11] they rest the scriptures that Paul wrote
[42:14] Paul wrote scripture right that's
[42:16] inspired word of God that's thus sayth
[42:18] the Lord all right good all right uh and
[42:21] then brother uh Chris acts 15:36 and
[42:24] Malachi get acts 2031 would you okay
[42:26] brother Chris acts 15:36 Malachi acts
[42:29] 2031 go ahead brother
[42:42] Chris okay very good now this doesn't
[42:45] say evangelist but that's what
[42:46] evangelist does they go from one city to
[42:48] the next uh they go from church to
[42:50] church to evangelized to declare the
[42:52] Gospel of Jesus Christ that's what Paul
[42:54] was doing here he'd already started the
[42:55] churches he don't need to be an apostle
[42:57] to them anymore now he needs to be an
[42:58] evangelist to them to stir up their
[43:00] faith to preach the gospel to declare
[43:02] the the promises of God to them good
[43:04] give Chris two class good job brother
[43:06] Chris now this is the one brother Ram
[43:07] uses to say he thought Paul was a pastor
[43:11] as well at Ephesus because he was there
[43:13] I think three and a half years if I'm
[43:14] not mistaken so Malachi do you want to
[43:16] read that it's acts uh
[43:25] 2031 all right give him two classs great
[43:27] job okay so brother uses that to say
[43:30] Paul was the first pastor of
[43:32] Ephesus okay because he stayed there so
[43:34] long three and a half years was it three
[43:36] and a half years or three years I always
[43:39] forget Mal do you remember was that
[43:40] three years or three and a half three
[43:41] okay just three okay great great okay so
[43:44] now you can see we have an A A Bible
[43:47] precedent for a man having all five
[43:49] preaching gifts okay and brother brandom
[43:52] started off as a pastor uh brother BR
[43:54] said he was ordained as a local pastor
[43:57] Pastor in 1932 so brother man the first
[43:59] gift he had was a pastor and he used
[44:02] that gift along with teaching until he
[44:05] left the brandham Tabernacle around 46
[44:07] or
[44:08] 47 so he was there at least uh 46 or 47
[44:12] uh that have been 14 or 15 years he was
[44:14] in the pastor Ministry and then he said
[44:16] when he was pastoring he would do
[44:17] teaching he said I would teach and I got
[44:19] the quotes in front of me uh he would
[44:22] teach on the Book of Revelation for a
[44:24] year and a half straight on one book
[44:27] okay so now we got P we got Pastor
[44:30] teacher okay and then in uh 1933 he gave
[44:34] the prophecy of the seven major Visions
[44:36] let me see I'll pull that up real quick
[44:38] and he said these were thus sayeth the
[44:41] Lord these were thus sayeth the Lord in
[44:43] 1933 so that was before the World War II
[44:46] right he predicted these three before
[44:48] World War II and we're seeing I believe
[44:50] I believe these three have been
[44:51] fulfilled I believe we'll see these come
[44:52] to pass very shortly and some people say
[44:55] they might already they might uh but I
[44:57] always have my reasons you know just
[44:59] humble reasons why so brother mam said
[45:01] uh in
[45:03] 1933 he says on the morning I went to
[45:06] dedicate the Tabernacle he said uh it
[45:09] blasted in right to left that in this
[45:11] hour it's been told since 1933 when the
[45:13] Holy Spirit gave me the visions and
[45:15] showed me the end times seven things
[45:17] that I spoke of and five of them brother
[45:19] bam thought had already happened now he
[45:20] didn't say five with thus say the Lord
[45:22] had already happened but we've seen
[45:24] these three have fully been of course
[45:26] manifested that was uh right after I
[45:29] mean not right after but that would have
[45:30] been U uh World War II ended in 1945 so
[45:33] that would have been uh what 12 years 12
[45:35] or yeah 12 years 33 45 12 years so these
[45:39] were fulfilled 12 years after they were
[45:42] given okay okay now his fourth one is
[45:45] Vance in science he said the last part
[45:47] of it was a American family in a bubble
[45:50] shaped type of car that's why I put that
[45:52] on there and they're facing each other
[45:54] playing some type of a board game and he
[45:57] said it's driving on beautiful highways
[45:59] we haven't had that yet I haven't seen
[46:00] it and of American family okay have you
[46:03] brother Rod seen
[46:04] one yeah it's here yes yes it's here yes
[46:08] so I'm waiting for like brother man said
[46:10] brother said they just don't have the
[46:11] highways yet that's what brother R said
[46:13] that was back in 63 or 64
[46:17] yeah right right so that one could be
[46:20] fulfilled now I personally believe it's
[46:22] got to be something like something an
[46:24] American highway it's got to be so it's
[46:26] got to be all over over the internet now
[46:27] it's not newspapers anymore it's got to
[46:29] be all over the internet where it's
[46:30] undeniable right now the fifth one he
[46:33] said this ends up with a woman he said
[46:35] was the immoral problem with women he
[46:37] said and it was it was headed up in a
[46:39] vision of a woman wearing nothing just a
[46:41] fig Leaf over her loins that's all it
[46:43] was now we probably had something like
[46:46] that but we don't want to see that right
[46:49] uh but it has to be has to
[46:51] happen Okay the sixth one was a woman
[46:54] rising in the power of the US and he
[46:55] said the woman had Purp on now some
[46:57] people think it's K Harris but you got
[46:58] to look at the rest of the vision the
[47:00] vision said the whole nation bowed to
[47:02] her I don't know about you but I didn't
[47:03] bow to anything Kamal hair
[47:06] said so to me it wasn't a woman it was
[47:09] the Roman Catholic church because she's
[47:11] a woman in in Revelation uh 17 and 18
[47:15] and what's her her color Scarlet and
[47:18] purple the whole nation has to Bow
[47:20] that's why I don't I I don't believe
[47:22] this one's fulfilled yet and the seventh
[47:23] one is the bombing now I don't know
[47:24] where that is in the Bible but I know
[47:26] this
[47:27] uh I know this we see that Beast out of
[47:29] the land in Revelation 13 brother B said
[47:31] that's United States of America is the
[47:33] last half of Revelation 13 but we don't
[47:35] see that Beast anymore after the Mark is
[47:37] laid down so sometime after the United
[47:39] States leads to the mark of the beast
[47:41] the United States will be destroyed
[47:42] brother saw it in a vision with thus
[47:43] sayith the Lord now if these came to
[47:45] pass so accurately I believe those will
[47:47] come to pass so accurately because it's
[47:49] God it's not man it's
[47:51] God okay I'm almost at my 45 minutes
[47:55] okay and then uh then brother BR said in
[47:57] 1946 he says seven years coming this
[48:00] week I left the Bram Tabernacle and went
[48:02] out into the Evangelistic campaigns of
[48:04] healing service so brother R said God
[48:06] sent me out with my gifts right uh the
[48:09] first gift was the dots on the hand and
[48:11] there's people alive that still saw them
[48:12] they're still alive today they saw the
[48:13] dots brother R would take somebody's
[48:15] hand brother rod and there would be a
[48:17] pattern of dots for like cancer or
[48:20] tuberculosis or heart disease and
[48:22] brother B had those patterns memorized
[48:24] yeah they were just like uh dark spots
[48:26] they look like bruises yeah uh one time
[48:29] he took his wife hand and said see my
[48:30] wife doesn't have anything wrong and the
[48:32] pattern came up of a t cancerous tumor
[48:34] and but it didn't show up for like five
[48:35] or six more years later but then God
[48:37] healed his wife and there's numerous
[48:40] people still alive that saw that that
[48:42] was the first poll the first stage of
[48:43] his ministry right the second stage was
[48:45] Discerning the thoughts and Tents of the
[48:46] heart which we'll see here and the the
[48:48] third stage was speaking the word of God
[48:51] just speaking like Jesus said speak to
[48:52] the mountain that was the third growth
[48:55] of brother Ram's Ministry speak the word
[48:57] remember he spoke to the snowstorm he
[48:58] spoke to the the tumor that his wife had
[49:00] and the doctor couldn't find it and
[49:03] remember there's a woman that was at
[49:04] that she was in that doctor's office
[49:07] when uh his wife had that tumor hanging
[49:09] on which I forget which side it was and
[49:11] it was on the table and she could barely
[49:12] get on the table and that woman said uh
[49:16] she saw that and then when the doctor
[49:18] went up to examine it it was gone so she
[49:20] saw she saw right before it was right
[49:23] right before it vanished and then she
[49:25] saw it was it was gone after that God
[49:28] took that tumor and God just vanished it
[49:31] because God told Brother Ram speak it
[49:33] whatever you say it'll be speak to the
[49:35] mountain right that's scriptural now
[49:37] there's my 45 minutes so
[49:40] H give me 15 more Church would
[49:43] you he said okay he raised his hands all
[49:46] right he clapped forward all right no
[49:50] thank
[49:51] you and then brother R started his uh
[49:55] fifth apostle Ministry around 1950 his
[49:58] first missionary trip was to Finland
[50:00] that was where the boy was ran over by
[50:02] the car and raised to life and that man
[50:04] was still alive I and he his family
[50:06] testified of it he was dead on the side
[50:09] of the road brother prayed for him he
[50:10] saw in a vision he's coming back to life
[50:12] and he come back to life he would
[50:13] testify to it there's people that knew
[50:15] his family like ad biso and different
[50:17] ones like that they've testified over
[50:18] the
[50:19] years so God is real Hallelujah God is
[50:21] in control so there's there's what I
[50:24] believe that's biblical proof somebody
[50:26] can have all five preaching gifts just
[50:28] like somebody could have all nine gifts
[50:29] of the holy spirit now I believe we
[50:31] could go through Paul's life and I need
[50:32] to do this I believe we can show he had
[50:34] all nine gifts of the Spirit too because
[50:35] he said I spoke in tongues more than you
[50:37] all well if he spoke in tongues I'm sure
[50:39] one time he
[50:41] interpreted you know and we know he's
[50:43] got faith he he spoke to the bloody flux
[50:45] and everything like he he had all kinds
[50:46] of Faith so uh Miracles I mean my
[50:49] goodness he no doubt he had all the all
[50:51] the gifts yes discernment yes that's
[50:53] right that's right very good brother now
[50:55] last one I got about four 13 minutes
[50:57] here now the last one was just fresh I
[50:59] just put this out
[51:01] today there's a cute guy who's that guy
[51:04] I'm talking about the little guy not the
[51:05] big
[51:06] guy the two ministries of Malachi uh 45
[51:10] and six that's why I named my son
[51:13] Malachi because I love the Book of
[51:14] Malachi actually I was looking up and I
[51:16] I seen what does Malachi mean it means
[51:18] my messenger so I said God give me a son
[51:21] that looks in my image and let him be
[51:23] your messenger so no pressure
[51:28] okay that was just my heart's desire God
[51:31] gave me my heart's desire so he kind of
[51:33] looks like me except he's bigger but
[51:34] I'll take
[51:35] that I'm very thankful for Malai he's
[51:38] been so
[51:41] faithful so the last question was
[51:44] um they said brother Jesse is is there
[51:47] two Ministries in Malachi 45 and six so
[51:52] right here here's the first Ministry
[51:54] turn the heart of the fathers of the
[51:55] children and here's the second Ministry
[51:57] I didn't highlight it but I want you to
[51:58] see the first part was fulfilled by John
[52:01] the
[52:02] Baptist but this phrase is never
[52:05] repeated in the rest of the
[52:08] Bible okay now brother brandom used and
[52:11] I I probably won't get to it tonight
[52:12] unless I take an hour and a half I'm not
[52:14] going to take an hour and a half tonight
[52:15] I got to work tomorrow
[52:18] uh but we we can show brother Bram says
[52:21] thus sayith the Lord he said this Elijah
[52:23] is on the Earth right now of course he
[52:25] was just given a a a clue to the elect
[52:27] that brother Ram's Ministry was this
[52:29] fulfillment okay that was the
[52:31] Fulfillment of it okay now so behold I
[52:34] send Elijah the prophet before the great
[52:36] coming Dreadful day of the Lord now
[52:37] Dreadful what's that fire that's
[52:39] Armageddon right remember Church
[52:41] remember
[52:42] this the King of the North Russia and
[52:45] the kings of the East China will bring
[52:47] all their soldiers against Israel and
[52:50] then the Bible said Jesus Will Come Out
[52:51] of Heaven destroy them with the sword of
[52:52] his mouth and then the Bible said in I
[52:55] forget which prophet it was
[52:57] but the Bible said the Israelis will be
[53:00] bearing the dead bodies for seven months
[53:02] after that battle zekiel thank you
[53:05] brother yes yeah that's right yeah
[53:06] Ezekiel 37 38 or either 38 39 38 39 very
[53:10] good brother very good and then for
[53:12] seven years they're going to be breaking
[53:13] the the tanks and everything the metal
[53:16] all the all the swords now they call it
[53:17] swords they're going to be breaking
[53:19] those and turning them into uh yeah all
[53:22] the garden tools garden tools yeah ver
[53:26] seven years going to pulling apart all
[53:28] these tanks and everything look look at
[53:30] all the weapons and the battleships and
[53:32] everything they got you know seven years
[53:34] to pull those
[53:35] apart okay so that that that's that's
[53:37] the Dreadful day of the Lord that hasn't
[53:39] happened
[53:40] yet okay
[53:42] so the spirit of Elijah was on John the
[53:45] Baptist he should go before him in the
[53:46] spirit and power of Elias to turn the
[53:47] hearts of the fathers to the children
[53:49] now here's different this is this isn't
[53:50] the same this is a different Ministry
[53:51] and I'm going to prove it to you tonight
[53:52] by God's grace and the disobedient to
[53:55] the wisdom of the just so
[53:57] John the Baptist was going to tell the
[53:58] disobedient he's going to give them
[54:00] wisdom to be fair and just now some of
[54:02] you might know where I'm going with this
[54:04] here right if you're real real familiar
[54:06] with John the Baptist ministry in the in
[54:08] the
[54:09] gospels okay now this was John the
[54:12] Baptist he turned the hearts of the
[54:13] fathers to the children now you now you
[54:16] I challenge you search it out show me a
[54:18] verse where John the Baptist was dealing
[54:20] with fathers to uh turn their hearts to
[54:23] their children care more about your
[54:24] children he he wasn't he wasn't doing a
[54:27] natural Ministry of fathers to Children
[54:29] it was a spiritual
[54:31] Ministry in other words he was telling
[54:33] the telling the fathers of the faith
[54:34] behold there's the Lamb of God who takes
[54:37] away the sin of the world Hallelujah
[54:39] follow him right he'll baptize you with
[54:41] the Holy Ghost he will Hallelujah so see
[54:46] that this wasn't a natural well you know
[54:48] Dad's let's have a dad's convention and
[54:50] let's show you how to love your your
[54:51] fathers that wasn't John the Baptist he
[54:53] was saying you're going to get the
[54:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost he said saying
[54:56] Jesus is the Lamb of God follow him
[54:58] Hallelujah he's the Messiah
[55:02] right so that's what he did he turned
[55:05] the hearts of the the the we'd say the
[55:07] apostolic fathers the the the the the
[55:10] fathers of the faith that were alive at
[55:11] Jesus first coming he turned their
[55:13] hearts back to the children or the
[55:15] people that would be alive at Jesus's
[55:17] second
[55:18] coming and that's this is what brother
[55:20] Ram did Brother Bram now turns the
[55:22] hearts of the children to their fathers
[55:25] in other words the children the the
[55:26] younger the the Young Generation that
[55:28] will be alive at the second coming of
[55:30] Christ it has to be because it's right
[55:32] before the Dreadful day of the Lord
[55:34] right before God pours out his wrath on
[55:36] the the Gentiles right as we just talked
[55:38] about with with Russia and China the
[55:40] kings of the East Kings of the north see
[55:42] he's got to send Elijah again to turn
[55:44] our hearts back to the fathers which is
[55:47] our hearts coming back to St Paul St
[55:49] John St Peter all the apostolic fathers
[55:52] of the faith hallelujah our hearts are
[55:54] turned back to the scriptures Hallelujah
[55:57] that's right now if you got your Bible
[56:00] uh well we'll just have I'll just have
[56:02] to read
[56:03] it okay Jesus yeah yeah Jesus said John
[56:07] the Baptist Was Elijah as well so not
[56:09] only did Luke record it Luke didn't see
[56:10] it Luke was a physician he was just
[56:12] recording historical
[56:14] events okay he wasn't an apostle uh but
[56:18] Jesus said John the Baptist was the
[56:20] spirit of Elijah okay so it's Matthew
[56:22] 11:14 and if ye will receive it this is
[56:25] Elias which was for to come so Jesus
[56:28] says John the Baptist is Elijah as
[56:31] well okay now here's where uh here's
[56:35] where we see a separation with these two
[56:37] so go to uh go to John 1:21 if you got
[56:40] your Bible go there because it's
[56:41] important John
[56:45] 1:21 and Caris since you're going there
[56:47] can you read it Caris I'll put you on
[56:49] the spot there you're good Under
[56:51] Pressure John
[56:55] 1:21 John 1: 211 now notice right here
[56:59] now either in this verse there's only
[57:00] three options either John the Baptist is
[57:02] lying which we know he wasn't or he
[57:05] didn't know he had the spirit of Elijah
[57:06] which he would have had to have known he
[57:08] had the spirit of
[57:09] Elijah or John was talking about a
[57:13] different Ministry of Elijah that's the
[57:15] answer ding ding ding ding ding ding
[57:16] ding it's a third option because Jesus
[57:19] said he was Elijah but then John says
[57:21] I'm not Elijah well he wasn't the last
[57:25] Elijah minister
[57:27] because Elijah comes again before the
[57:30] great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[57:32] there's Church read your Bible Rod knows
[57:34] this there's only one day of the Lord
[57:35] It's the day of Destruction that's
[57:36] Armageddon there's only one day of the
[57:38] Lord there's not days and days and weeks
[57:41] of the Lord there's one day of the Lord
[57:49] Armageddon yeah the Battle of
[57:52] arm I don't know how long it's going to
[57:54] last that's a good question it's in
[57:55] Revelation 19
[57:57] all the armies are gathered against
[57:58] Israel so Jesus comes out of Heaven on a
[57:59] white horse we're all behind him on
[58:01] White Horses by God's grace dressed in
[58:03] the white righteousness of the Robes of
[58:04] Jesus Christ but Jesus wins the battle
[58:07] he sends a sword out of his mouth it's
[58:08] just the spirit of God destroys all them
[58:11] and then the Bible said God takes that
[58:12] fire burns the outside of the earth that
[58:14] spreads and then we walk down on the
[58:16] ashes of the wicked into the
[58:18] Millennium The Book of Malachi says that
[58:20] as well okay and then they're bearing
[58:22] the bodies for SE seven months of all
[58:26] the slain soldiers okay all right and I
[58:29] got you I got you on John 1 121 and they
[58:31] asked him what then art thou Elias and
[58:33] he said I am not wait Jesus said you
[58:35] were are you lying John no John do you
[58:39] not know your ministry no John knew it
[58:40] he said I'm the voice of one crying in
[58:42] the wilderness prepare and make ready
[58:44] for the coming of the Lord hallelujah he
[58:45] knew is he knew who he he knew who he
[58:47] was Hallelujah and he knew that because
[58:49] yes this was uh told to his father as
[58:51] well that's right in Luke
[58:54] 1:17 art thou that prophet he answered
[58:56] no so John says no I'm not Elijah Jesus
[58:59] said he is Elijah well there must be two
[59:01] Elijah and the church said have you seen
[59:04] a rod I've watched numerous Orthodox
[59:07] Jewish videos and they say at the end of
[59:09] every Passover they knock on the door
[59:11] and they're wait and somebody will stand
[59:12] there and said the let men say who are
[59:14] you Elijah Elijah's here oh my they know
[59:18] when Elijah comes their messiah's coming
[59:21] too hallelujah amen now that's the
[59:23] Elijah in Revelation 11 to Israel but
[59:26] there's also an Elijah to the Gentiles
[59:28] to turn our hearts back to the apostolic
[59:31] fathers Hallelujah because John pointed
[59:33] them to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[59:34] he's going to baptize you with the Holy
[59:36] Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost was
[59:37] for the New Testament Hallelujah not the
[59:40] Old Testament right that's why that's
[59:42] why our Elijah has to turn us back to
[59:44] the baptism of the Holy Ghost because
[59:45] that's what John the Baptist pointed
[59:46] them to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[59:48] not to the law of Moses not the blood of
[59:50] bulls and goats but to the baptism of
[59:52] the Holy Ghost hallelujah oh my
[59:54] Hallelujah this is good glory not me not
[59:56] CU of me there's nothing good in me I'm
[59:57] a sinner saved by grace I'm nothing I'm
[59:59] a as far as I you can say I'm a piece of
[1:00:01] trash but the Lord Jesus Christ his word
[1:00:03] is true
[1:00:06] Hallelujah so see Jesus calls John
[1:00:08] Elijah Elijah says I'm not Elijah in
[1:00:10] other words I'm not the Elijah before
[1:00:12] the great and Dreadful day you can look
[1:00:13] at all the commentaries all the most of
[1:00:15] the commentaries say that John was
[1:00:16] saying I'm not the Elijah to come before
[1:00:18] the Dreadful day of the Lord because
[1:00:21] Church there's going to be 2,000 years
[1:00:22] God's going to Blind Israel because they
[1:00:24] rejected Jesus there's going to be 2,000
[1:00:26] years of Gentile Church ages before the
[1:00:28] Dreadful day of the Lord there's going
[1:00:30] to be all this time God's got to send
[1:00:32] Elijah again and then he's going to send
[1:00:33] him one more time five comings of Elijah
[1:00:36] Elijah Elisha John the Baptist William
[1:00:38] brandom and the Elijah to come with
[1:00:40] Moses in Revelation
[1:00:42] 11
[1:00:46] Hallelujah that'll be in the seven years
[1:00:48] we won't be here if we're born again
[1:00:49] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:00:51] we go out to meet Jesus at the wedding
[1:00:52] or at the marriage supper in the sky no
[1:00:54] I'm sorry uh the Rapture in the Sky then
[1:00:56] we go to the marriage supper yeah as
[1:00:58] long as we got the oil remember the
[1:00:59] parable the wise versions everybody
[1:01:02] heard it oh the Jesus coming Jesus
[1:01:03] coming but only one group had extra oil
[1:01:05] that's the baptism of the Holy
[1:01:07] Ghost so if we got it we got the oil
[1:01:09] we'll go out to meet him we'll meet him
[1:01:11] in the air the Bible said we uh she read
[1:01:13] it tonight who read it nature read it
[1:01:14] will be changed in a moment twinkl of an
[1:01:16] eye praise God you can't get ready
[1:01:17] quickly you got to already have the oil
[1:01:19] amen you got to have the baptism of the
[1:01:21] Holy Ghost
[1:01:24] Hallelujah that's why Chrismas when I
[1:01:26] first came in this message I heard about
[1:01:27] that I would on numerous occasions I
[1:01:29] would wait till all the people were gone
[1:01:30] to in my house at the college house and
[1:01:32] I just get on my knees and say God fill
[1:01:34] me with the Holy Ghost God I would just
[1:01:35] yell God fill me with the Holy Ghost God
[1:01:37] send an angel and I just kept waiting
[1:01:38] until the day after I got married and
[1:01:40] then the Holy Ghost fell on me praise
[1:01:41] God and I shouted in joice and praise
[1:01:44] God like I'd never done before and I
[1:01:46] walked out of that church saying I love
[1:01:47] everybody in here I've never felt loved
[1:01:49] like this in my life who can I love can
[1:01:50] I buy a meal I was buying meals for
[1:01:51] people on the drive home I was just full
[1:01:53] of God's love I never felt that way
[1:01:55] before I saw a vision of the Cross
[1:01:57] that's the only time I've seen a vision
[1:01:58] in my whole life while I was awake it
[1:02:00] was just it was so
[1:02:03] Supernatural huh and of all days the day
[1:02:06] after I was married too praise
[1:02:08] God Jews are still looking for this
[1:02:10] Elijah to
[1:02:13] come okay I got two minutes left on my
[1:02:15] hour now yes I'm
[1:02:18] sorry let's do I'm going to close of
[1:02:20] this now this so so so one one of the
[1:02:22] critics of brother BR said oh no this
[1:02:24] phrase right here is the Fulfillment and
[1:02:27] no it's not no it's not because the
[1:02:30] heart's got to be turned back to the
[1:02:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost John was
[1:02:34] pointing the the fathers to the children
[1:02:36] to the Future right to the generation
[1:02:39] that would see his coming say You must
[1:02:41] be born again you he shall baptize you
[1:02:43] with the Holy Ghost right it's all about
[1:02:44] the baptism of the Holy Ghost this this
[1:02:47] means uh if you got your Bible go to
[1:02:49] Luke chapter 3 ver10 Luke Chapter 3:10
[1:02:51] I'm almost going to close here so
[1:02:53] appreciate everybody's Patience by God's
[1:02:54] grace
[1:02:56] this has been good tonight it's been a
[1:02:57] good uh lesson in the scriptures by
[1:02:59] God's grace and church all these things
[1:03:01] brother Bram
[1:03:02] taught I God didn't show this to me I'm
[1:03:05] nothing I'm just I'm just reading what
[1:03:07] he said I'm just I could point you to
[1:03:09] all these quotes brother Braham said
[1:03:10] this is Brother BR this is Brother br's
[1:03:11] Ministry because he's a prophet of
[1:03:14] God okay now and the disobedient to the
[1:03:17] wisdom of the J so John is gonna uh make
[1:03:20] the disobedient understand the wisdom to
[1:03:23] be fair everybody read this real close
[1:03:26] now get your uh glasses on clean off
[1:03:28] your glasses if you got glasses clean
[1:03:30] off your uh your contacts if you got
[1:03:32] contacts let's see if there's any
[1:03:34] disobedient people in here that need to
[1:03:36] have wisdom to be fair and just verse 10
[1:03:39] and the people asked him saying what
[1:03:40] shall we do then they asked John the
[1:03:41] Baptist what are we going to do verse 11
[1:03:43] he answered and said to him he that hath
[1:03:45] two coats let him impart to him that
[1:03:46] hath none and he that hath meat let him
[1:03:49] do
[1:03:50] likewise okay now that's not disobedient
[1:03:52] yet but it's vers it's coming up now
[1:03:54] verse 12 an were the worst people in the
[1:03:58] entire Bible days they were the lowest
[1:04:01] of the low Tax Collectors they could say
[1:04:05] you owe $50 and you might only owe $1
[1:04:07] they could rob you for all your money
[1:04:09] and you had there was nothing you could
[1:04:11] do about it because if you if you go to
[1:04:13] the Roman Emperor you say no no I you
[1:04:15] have to give them whatever they're my
[1:04:17] they're my servants they could just rip
[1:04:19] you off now we get mad if we go to the
[1:04:21] IRS and we don't get a big return back
[1:04:24] but we got it good compared to what they
[1:04:25] had
[1:04:27] they you you could owe a th they could
[1:04:29] charge you 10,000 and you had to pay it
[1:04:32] these were the lowest of the low so they
[1:04:34] asked the publicans came to be baptized
[1:04:36] and said Master what shall we do Oh you
[1:04:38] mean the disobedient that's what zakus
[1:04:40] was he was rich off of steal money from
[1:04:43] people he said any man I've I've done
[1:04:45] wrong I'll restore them four times the
[1:04:47] amount that's a real repentant heart
[1:04:49] right
[1:04:53] there what shall we do verse 13 He said
[1:04:55] them exact no more take no more than
[1:04:57] that which is appointed to you see if
[1:05:00] there was like a 3% tax then they might
[1:05:02] oh I I'm going to take 10% of them so I
[1:05:04] can make myself rich like zakus did but
[1:05:07] when the spirit of God came what it do
[1:05:09] it made the disobedient have the wisdom
[1:05:11] to be just to be fair just take what's
[1:05:16] required and don't take
[1:05:18] anymore see that now verse 14 and the
[1:05:22] soldiers likewise demanded him saying
[1:05:23] what shall we do and he said unto them
[1:05:25] do violence to no man see don't be
[1:05:27] disobedient just don't beat people up
[1:05:28] because you're the you're the police
[1:05:31] officer don't be
[1:05:34] disobedient do violence to no man
[1:05:36] neither accuse any falsely so see they
[1:05:38] pay him off uh Roman soldier let me pay
[1:05:40] you a few daer here whatever they had
[1:05:42] you know mites of course mites wouldn't
[1:05:43] be enough let me give you a few talents
[1:05:46] here and and you come testify against
[1:05:48] this person and I'm going to get I'm
[1:05:50] going to get my day in
[1:05:52] court see but John's like no don't do
[1:05:54] that don't be dis obedient use wisdom of
[1:05:57] the just be fair be just with all these
[1:06:00] things and be content with your wages
[1:06:04] see don't be disobedient always
[1:06:05] complaining about I don't make enough
[1:06:07] money I don't I why don't you work
[1:06:08] harder why you making yourself more
[1:06:10] valuable you'll be worth more
[1:06:12] money right why don't you work harder
[1:06:14] why don't you find a better job why
[1:06:16] don't you go Ed educate yourself see
[1:06:18] some people complain why they don't have
[1:06:19] enough money well why don't you pay the
[1:06:20] price and and get some good
[1:06:22] training why don't you do that the thing
[1:06:25] is most people just don't want to save
[1:06:26] money that's the thing they got a bad
[1:06:28] habit of spending and the church said
[1:06:30] that's the thing that's the problem with
[1:06:32] people and so some of these soldiers had
[1:06:34] some bad bad habits too and he says
[1:06:37] don't be fair be content with your wages
[1:06:39] don't complain for a raise every year

[1:09:19] him glory God still has testimonies
[1:09:23] Hallelujah to know that God said there
[1:09:25] was God sent a prophet among them
[1:09:27] Hallelujah now here's three that come to
[1:09:29] pass or six that come to pass in 1958
[1:09:31] Marilyn Hickey now she's a woman
[1:09:33] preacher with short hair makeup brother
[1:09:34] Braham would not never approve of that
[1:09:36] but she was in a prayer line and brother
[1:09:38] Braham discerns here you've come from
[1:09:39] Denver Colorado thus sayith the Lord
[1:09:41] that's right go home and receive your
[1:09:43] child God will give it to you if you
[1:09:45] believe so see some people say oh well
[1:09:48] if that that's gives him a way out but
[1:09:50] that's what Jesus said Jesus said all
[1:09:51] things are possible if you can believe
[1:09:54] sometimes God will put it on you to
[1:09:55] believe he'll challenge your faith other
[1:09:57] times God will just heal you and he's
[1:09:58] not going to challenge your faith I
[1:10:00] prove that by the
[1:10:01] scripture like that man in John chapter
[1:10:04] 5 that who was paralyzed Jesus said just
[1:10:06] take up your bed and walk like he didn't
[1:10:07] say if you believe he just said take it
[1:10:08] up and it just God just did it there was
[1:10:10] no if about it but in this case there
[1:10:12] was an if and she and she 10 years later
[1:10:15] had only one child and it was thus
[1:10:18] sayith the Lord and come to
[1:10:21] pass a couple years later 1961 brother
[1:10:23] Ram said there'll be no greater gift to
[1:10:25] the Gentiles than his ministry thus
[1:10:27] sayith the Lord you'll never in any no
[1:10:29] more Gentile Church age see any sign to
[1:10:32] succeed this go greater this is the last
[1:10:34] sign to the Gentile Church
[1:10:37] Hallelujah now the Jews will receive
[1:10:39] Great Signs right the blood will I'm
[1:10:41] sorry moon moon moon will turn to blood
[1:10:43] and so forth all those signs in The
[1:10:45] Sixth Seal in Revelation 11 uh
[1:10:47] earthquake in the city there'll be great
[1:10:48] signs there but this is true because
[1:10:51] like here's one example from 1954
[1:10:53] Brotherman was in a prayer line in
[1:10:54] Washington DC he told this woman 15
[1:10:57] Secrets she's sick dark Spirit he names
[1:11:00] the spirit's death it's on video you can
[1:11:02] watch it it's cancer it's breast cancer
[1:11:04] he was she was examined by a strong
[1:11:06] person ruptured condition in the bow
[1:11:07] stomach trouble severe heart trouble
[1:11:09] causes fainting nearly passed out
[1:11:10] sitting on a bed now you can't memorize
[1:11:12] that God's got to tell you that and then
[1:11:14] she he wasn't even done and then he said
[1:11:16] I still see a dark Spirit there your
[1:11:18] name's Eva York you live in this city
[1:11:20] Washington DC address is uh 6136 Street
[1:11:24] you're going home to be well thus sayeth
[1:11:26] the Lord that's a real prophet of God
[1:11:29] we've never seen any gift greater than
[1:11:31] this I'm watching I'm looking I'm
[1:11:33] looking online brother Austin I'm
[1:11:34] waiting because there it's thus sayith
[1:11:36] the Lord he said it six times thus
[1:11:38] sayith the Lord there'll be never
[1:11:39] greater no greater gift to the Gentiles
[1:11:42] till the coming for for the rest of the
[1:11:43] time of the Gentiles it's thus sayith
[1:11:45] the
[1:11:46] Lord third brother Ram said I've got
[1:11:48] thus sayith the Lord now this is
[1:11:49] according to that the fifth Vision where
[1:11:51] the Fig Leaf Vision brother Ram said
[1:11:53] according to that it's thus sayi the
[1:11:54] Lord she'll Contin God said you she'll
[1:11:56] continue to strip herself and look what
[1:11:58] we got today yoga pants and bikinis all
[1:12:00] summer that's if they're
[1:12:03] modest that's if they choose to be
[1:12:05] modest on those hot days because instead
[1:12:07] of instead of yoga pants they have yoga
[1:12:09] shorts
[1:12:11] on yes that's right exactly
[1:12:15] right oh it's so awful it's thus sayith
[1:12:18] the Lord that was all those years ago
[1:12:20] that was
[1:12:22] 1960 62 yeah 62 look where we are
[1:12:27] today now remember church just so
[1:12:29] remember remember the 1970s was the year
[1:12:32] of women in pants I'm a teacher I get
[1:12:34] magazines brother from the union I'm not
[1:12:36] anymore because I'm out but they even
[1:12:37] put out a magazine it was God and they
[1:12:40] said 1970 was the year teachers in
[1:12:42] schools got to wear suit
[1:12:45] pants right like brother R said they'll
[1:12:47] they crossdressed they started wearing
[1:12:49] women's clothing and now look where
[1:12:50] they're at now they're almost
[1:12:52] naked like even teachersday can wear
[1:12:54] yoga pants and all I mean in the school
[1:12:57] in the
[1:12:59] school now they haven't yet wore like
[1:13:01] sports BRS like you saying yet but they
[1:13:03] you wear yoga pants they might as
[1:13:04] well just walk down the hallway like
[1:13:07] this try not to bump into the kids I
[1:13:10] don't want to run you over guys
[1:13:12] but the fourth Vision uh this was from
[1:13:16] 1965 brother Ram saw a vision he said
[1:13:18] now this is thus say the Lord he saw the
[1:13:20] Church of the United States in a symbol
[1:13:23] he says they had on these tattle tail
[1:13:25] gray skirts like these barroom girls no
[1:13:27] back on it so they have skirts but no
[1:13:29] back on the back side brother said he
[1:13:31] had to turn his face when he saw
[1:13:34] it he says holding up he said a hola
[1:13:37] dancing and uh paint makeup short hair
[1:13:40] bobbed hair smoking cigarettes twisting
[1:13:41] doing the twist to rock and roll brother
[1:13:44] man said is that the church United
[1:13:45] States yes it
[1:13:47] is and church you know this is just s
[1:13:50] symbolism now look there's some some
[1:13:53] recent data from 2025 said there's
[1:13:55] either 16 people 16 million people or 67
[1:13:58] that attend church every
[1:14:00] week that's either 4.6% of Americans and
[1:14:04] 19 or
[1:14:06] 19.6 as see this small we'd say a small
[1:14:08] little group I mean how many of those
[1:14:10] people smoke cigarettes it wasn't saying
[1:14:12] every person in the church it would just
[1:14:13] say the church would be defiled by these
[1:14:16] things right in modest skirts with no
[1:14:19] backs I was I I I got saved in the
[1:14:21] chapel there was women there wearing
[1:14:23] dresses that had no backs on them
[1:14:26] and skirts that were super short and
[1:14:28] distracting to worship even before I
[1:14:29] knew brother Ram's message that was back
[1:14:31] in 2001
[1:14:33] 2002 bobbed hair they've had bobbed hair
[1:14:36] for all these years makeup shaking their
[1:14:37] hips to rock and and my mom said this
[1:14:39] brother my mom was born in 1950 she was
[1:14:41] raised assembles of God and I asked her
[1:14:44] about this I told her about this and she
[1:14:45] said when we were growing up they just
[1:14:46] had the piano she said I never thought
[1:14:49] they'd bring rock and roll to the church
[1:14:51] but she said around the Year 20002000
[1:14:53] 2005 right in there she would go to the
[1:14:55] youth conferences and that's when they
[1:14:57] started bringing rock and roll and she
[1:14:59] said now there's rap and you just so I
[1:15:02] told you Mom now my mom doesn't follow
[1:15:03] this message brother R but I told her I
[1:15:05] said Mom you have seen brother R's
[1:15:07] Vision fulfilled thus sayith the Lord
[1:15:10] because the church is now dancing to
[1:15:11] rock and roll Joel o is the one that
[1:15:13] made it famous because every other
[1:15:15] church has copied him yeah you know
[1:15:18] brother they all try to copy up S up
[1:15:20] there and everything's so beautiful I'm
[1:15:22] spitting around here and saying glory to
[1:15:24] God
[1:15:26] hallah but everybody tries to just be
[1:15:29] this professional everything's fine and
[1:15:31] Prosperity Gospel he's the one that
[1:15:32] brought in rock and roll and every
[1:15:34] church has tried to be like him brother
[1:15:40] Chris yes
[1:15:43] yes right yep until they put pressure on
[1:15:47] him then he finally let them in yes
[1:15:48] people are homeless and he wouldn't even
[1:15:49] open up his church yep yep oh yeah he
[1:15:53] said he would go to a homosexual wedding
[1:15:55] he said that if it was his friend and
[1:15:57] they asked him why don't you preach on
[1:15:58] it he said well they got enough trouble
[1:16:00] in their life well they need to know
[1:16:01] about it so they can get rid of their
[1:16:02] abomination and get saved but he won't
[1:16:04] even preach on
[1:16:06] Abominations
[1:16:09] awful fifth one 1965 brother Ram said
[1:16:12] thus sayith the Lord Florence sharan was
[1:16:14] going to die now the critics say well uh
[1:16:16] of course she had cancer it's not hard
[1:16:18] to predict that but the reason this is
[1:16:20] prophetic is because uh Florence sharan
[1:16:22] was a brother I'm sorry a sister to de
[1:16:24] sharen who is head of the um the the
[1:16:27] Christian businessman Association so
[1:16:29] these guys were all had prophetic gifts
[1:16:31] and everything and they were all
[1:16:32] prophesying she's going to be healed of
[1:16:33] the cancer brother Ram was the only one
[1:16:35] saying sorry guys God showed me a vision
[1:16:37] she's going home to be with the Lord and
[1:16:39] all the other guys were saying she's
[1:16:41] going to all the other Pentecostals were
[1:16:42] saying she's going to be healed that's
[1:16:43] why this is significant yes I know it's
[1:16:46] easy to it would be easy to predict
[1:16:47] someone to die from cancer but the the
[1:16:49] the point was all the prophets of that
[1:16:51] day and the and the Pentecostals were
[1:16:53] saying she's going to be healed with us
[1:16:54] say the Lord Brother Braham said no
[1:16:56] she's going to die then she died by
[1:16:59] September of that year she'd already
[1:17:01] passed away and that's what that's what
[1:17:02] Elijah foretold remember he told King
[1:17:04] ahaz he said set your house in order
[1:17:06] you're going to die so there is times
[1:17:07] when people are sick and a prophet will
[1:17:09] tell you thus sayith the Lord you're not
[1:17:10] getting up from
[1:17:11] that okay so there's five told the
[1:17:14] future with thus sayith the Lord in the
[1:17:16] name of the Lord that's a real prophet
[1:17:18] and the last one I love this one let's
[1:17:20] stand our feet you've been you've been a
[1:17:21] very good audience I've gone way over an
[1:17:23] hour uh say wait but a little bit over I
[1:17:27] love I love this one so
[1:17:29] much because I can almost hear it my
[1:17:31] head I've heard it so many times I can
[1:17:32] almost hear Brother B saying it he said
[1:17:34] it's predicted that they're going to do
[1:17:35] it the denominations and they're going
[1:17:36] to do it for it's thus sayith the lord
[1:17:38] they're going to do it you think them
[1:17:40] denomination he calls them
[1:17:42] nominations you think them nominations
[1:17:44] will ever break up their denomination
[1:17:46] come back to the word now what's he
[1:17:47] talking about the word no women
[1:17:48] preachers right the Bible right the
[1:17:50] water baptism in the name of the Lord
[1:17:52] Jesus Christ the baptism of the Holy
[1:17:53] Ghost where the tongues are not the
[1:17:54] evidence the evidence is of the life of
[1:17:56] Jesus Christ Hallelujah now you might
[1:17:57] speak in tongues you might not you might
[1:17:59] shout you might dance you might scream
[1:18:00] you might boohoo at the altar but
[1:18:02] something's going to happen life is
[1:18:03] going to come into you Hallelujah and
[1:18:05] you're going to be changed the power of
[1:18:07] God is going to be inside of you because
[1:18:09] then Paul says not all speak with
[1:18:10] tongues not all are prophets not
[1:18:11] everybody has to be a prophet right or
[1:18:14] Apostle are all
[1:18:17] Apostles will any denomination ever
[1:18:20] break up and come back to the brother's
[1:18:22] bible-based teaching or Paul's teaching
[1:18:24] it's thus say the Lord they won't that's
[1:18:26] why I've told some of your family
[1:18:27] members you better come out of
[1:18:29] denomination he says thus say will they
[1:18:32] go into the Antichrist system exactly
[1:18:34] it's thus sayith the
[1:18:36] Lord because every denomination is a
[1:18:38] daughter of the mother denomination the
[1:18:40] Roman Catholic
[1:18:42] Church
[1:18:43] Hallelujah so what are you saying I have
[1:18:45] to be a witness and so do you all
[1:18:47] believers watch now look it's been
[1:18:49] that's uh uh this year it's going to be
[1:18:51] 60 years in 60 years has any
[1:18:53] denomination even tried to come back to
[1:18:55] the truth no they just usually get more
[1:18:57] worldly more compromised more members
[1:19:00] right bigger
[1:19:02] buildings thus saith the Lord how many
[1:19:06] glad you're standing with thus sayith
[1:19:07] the Lord today musicians can
[1:19:10] come how many enjoyed the questions and
[1:19:12] answers tonight by God's grace amen

[1:19:16] hallelujah it's just to Rejoice that
[1:19:18] Jesus has sent us a genuine Prophet
[1:19:21] Hallelujah and we know the scripture is
[1:19:23] true uh like I these are all these are
[1:19:25] all thus sayith the Lord's here it's

[1:19:31] some of you probably don't remember uh
[1:19:33] it's been what seven years now so I was

[1:19:36] refresh you on all these th so it's from
[1:19:39] 651 all the way down to

[1:19:45] so many
[1:19:46] times that's where he said oh yeah this
[1:19:48] is where he says Malachi 4 remember it's
[1:19:50] thus say the Lord it'll come to pass in

[1:20:34] word the word was confirmed the son of
