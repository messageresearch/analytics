[24:03] holiday best and let's think our bye was
[24:05] this evening by the grace of Lord I
[24:10] imagine that let's read out of let's go
[24:15] to try there's just different there's
[24:18] two different thoughts I kind of want to
[24:19] bring out tonight so let's just go to
[24:21] revelation 21:27 and we'll just we'll
[24:26] just read that for our text but I'm
[24:28] gonna background a little bit revelation
[24:37] 21:27 I'll try to be mindful the time
[24:44] here by God's grace I want to look at
[24:48] modesty again we've been look at the
[24:50] last couple weeks we've been looking at
[24:51] kind of reviewing modesty why we dressed
[24:54] the way we dress and so forth like that
[24:57] to update you on my book I'm writing
[24:59] this book and I think I have three
[25:01] thousand words done in Chapter five and
[25:04] this is on like all the other we I mean
[25:08] I've already done a chapter on hair
[25:12] clothing modest clothing there's a
[25:15] couple chapters this is the chapter that
[25:16] covers like jewelry makeup high heels
[25:21] and someone tattoos that's what and this
[25:25] one's taken the longest because there's
[25:26] so many scriptures about jeweler I
[25:27] didn't I didn't realize I must have
[25:29] forgot there's so many scriptures on
[25:31] jewelry in the Bible's haha it's taking
[25:33] all I'm taking a lot of ours I'm I'm
[25:35] just devoting a lot of hours and then to
[25:37] you know pray about that and what I find
[25:39] wonderful though that as I get into the
[25:40] channel the Holy Spirit brings the
[25:42] thoughts you know and gives me the right
[25:44] balance between the scriptures so I'm
[25:47] excited about that and just then you
[25:50] know this chapter is the slowest chapter
[25:51] so far because it requires so much
[25:54] additional study but praise the Lord
[25:56] anyhow
[25:56] god is good Revelation chapter 21 verse
[25:59] 27 let's read this together I like to
[26:01] look at abominations tonight and kinda
[26:04] like rightly dividing the Old Testament
[26:07] revelation 21:27 let's read this
[26:10] together on three one two three and
[26:12] there shall in no wise enter into it any
[26:16] thing that defileth neither whatsoever
[26:18] worketh abomination or maketh a lie
[26:22] but they which are written in the Lamb's
[26:25] Book of Life
[26:26] Amen may God had his blessing serene of
[26:28] his word may be seated here praise the
[26:30] Lord so I was gonna ask the children to
[26:35] get ready to read here and not our
[26:38] guests now artists are regular children
[26:41] so Lydia Malachi and maybe Rebecca glad
[26:44] you can you have her Bibles handy we'll
[26:46] probably lean on you guys to do some
[26:47] reading there I want to start though
[26:50] back in second Kings 9:00 Wednesday we
[26:54] looked at make up and so let's go to 2nd
[26:58] Kings 9 I want to look at this thought
[26:59] on Jezebel's I was preaching on that
[27:01] thought you know I never studied out
[27:02] what does Emery mean remember her
[27:04] response was like Oh aren't you gonna be
[27:06] like Zimri gee who aren't you gonna be
[27:08] like Zimri I always wondered what was
[27:10] that about so I went studied it and now
[27:12] I understand so I think it'll be a
[27:13] blessing to you so it's gonna 2nd Kings
[27:15] chapter 9 I love these gold nuggets the
[27:18] Prophet talked about I just love going
[27:20] deeper in the Word of God and
[27:21] understanding the scripture so second
[27:26] Kings 9 and I'll watch this spear on
[27:29] Jezebel watch this spirit remember she's
[27:32] the one that's murdered she's murdered
[27:34] hundreds of Hebrew prophets she murdered
[27:37] neighbor the Bible said she committed
[27:39] whoredoms now I don't know if that's
[27:40] natural whoredoms with other men or just
[27:44] spiritual whoredoms but the Bible said
[27:45] she was guilty of whoredoms murders
[27:48] idolatry all kinds of wicked things now
[27:52] second Kings 9 when we start with
[27:56] Malachi Elijah Malachi why don't you
[27:58] read 30 and then Elijah we read 31
[28:03] please sir
[28:22] all right thank you
[28:23] now as I was preaching on that I was
[28:25] like I kind of feel bad I wish I knew it
[28:27] who's Emery was and was it Henry was but
[28:31] let's look at this now remember from
[28:32] this from this story
[28:34] Jehu was anointed by I believe Elijah
[28:37] from the a by thy chef I'm not mistaken
[28:40] Elijah and he had already brought
[28:43] vengeance upon a Habs family he'd
[28:47] already end the lives of all a Habs and
[28:49] Jezebel's sons so that news had got back
[28:52] to Jezebel and she knew you know Jay
[28:55] who's coming for me she knew that
[28:56] according to what the historians say the
[28:58] commentaries so when she heard now that
[29:02] he's coming she paints her face and she
[29:05] does this in other defiance this is in
[29:07] defiance now uh on Wednesday I said
[29:10] maybe it was for to seduce him but I
[29:12] don't think it was that I think it was
[29:13] just utter defiance I think because she
[29:18] was an older woman you know she had
[29:19] children that were raised I don't think
[29:21] she was trying to seduce Jihu it doesn't
[29:23] look like that in the context but we
[29:25] know of course women today do that right
[29:27] that's why women paint their face up
[29:28] many times to attract men with a false
[29:32] face
[29:33] but anyways she paints her face and
[29:36] tires her head so she tyre means to
[29:39] arrange her hair cut in a calmly manner
[29:41] so she makes her hair I guess look as
[29:43] pretty as she can and paints her face
[29:45] and looks out the window so she doesn't
[29:48] go hide when she knows judgments coming
[29:50] she goes and stands right in the face of
[29:53] the man of God doesn't run away and
[29:58] repent you know doesn't try to get away
[30:00] she just stands there she's the queen
[30:02] she's she's gonna stand her ground and
[30:05] that's striking look at the boldness of
[30:07] this woman look at the boldness of this
[30:08] woman the utter rebellion of this woman
[30:11] this disappeared behind Jezebel remember
[30:13] this whole same spirit Jesus said is in
[30:15] the New Testament church deceiving
[30:17] churches today right same spirit spear
[30:19] of Jezebel
[30:20] and seduces my servants so we have to
[30:23] watch out for that sphere amongst us
[30:25] amongst all of us now
[30:29] to understand zimri now Jay who Jay who
[30:33] orgy who keeps saying Jay who I think
[30:35] it's G who entered in at the gate and
[30:38] she looks out at G who and says had
[30:41] Zimri peace who slew his master so in
[30:45] other words she's saying something about
[30:47] do you think you're gonna have any peace
[30:49] after what you're gonna do G who now
[30:53] let's find out whose Emory was so let's
[30:55] go to first I'm sorry that's the wrong
[30:58] one notes
[30:59] yeah that's first King 16 I'm sorry yeah
[31:01] first King 16 so her last attempt to
[31:05] save her life is to try to get this man
[31:08] of God if he you feel guilty I thought
[31:12] God this is her last attempt they're
[31:16] trying to work on his emotions maybe he
[31:18] won't bring the hammer down with me or
[31:20] maybe I can bring self condemnation on
[31:22] him this is her last attempt to save her
[31:25] life and this woman who's guilty of
[31:28] murders and guilty of whoredoms
[31:31] and all this wretched with the most
[31:33] notorious woman in the entire Bible her
[31:35] last attempt to save her life
[31:37] is to put the blame off of her not
[31:40] repent when she sees judgement coming
[31:41] she doesn't repent she boldly stands
[31:43] against it and tries to get the
[31:45] attention off of her and get it on the
[31:46] man of God that he'll feel ashamed of
[31:49] himself in that striking how many see
[31:52] that was sinners they try to make you
[31:53] feel guilty
[31:54] you're just trying to do what's right
[31:56] but they put all the blame on you yet
[31:59] there are the guilty ones they're the
[32:00] ones that need to repent they're the
[32:02] ones that need to feel bad but for some
[32:04] reasons Christians we just always feel
[32:05] bad right we feel like oh it's me I'm
[32:09] not doing the right thing but when word
[32:11] obeying the word of God when we're
[32:13] trying to cut sin out of our lives it's
[32:14] the right thing first King 16 let's find
[32:18] out who simmer II was so in other words
[32:22] she's saying oh you're just gonna be
[32:24] like Zimri G who don't you remember
[32:27] zimri first King 16 Lydia and Rebecca
[32:32] are you ready okay
[32:33] are you ready do you want to redo no
[32:35] okay sorry all right Lydia why don't you
[32:41] do eight or ten okay so who is zimri
[33:14] Zimmer II was a servant of a king and he
[33:19] conspired and he got the King drunk so
[33:22] he could kill him and then he took his
[33:23] throne and look at Jezebel Jezebel's
[33:27] like oh you're just like zimri cuz
[33:29] that's what Jay who's coming in to now
[33:30] he's not gonna really take over
[33:31] necessarily but she's trying to get him
[33:35] to feel bad Oh like you're just doing a
[33:37] conspiracy you're just getting rid of me
[33:40] in a selfish way that's when you got to
[33:43] know is this my feelings or is this
[33:45] God's leadership we know if it's God's
[33:47] leadership praise God not our feelings
[33:50] not our desires but what is the Holy
[33:52] Ghost leading me to do praise God and
[33:55] I'll always lead us away from sin always
[34:00] well the RAM said that I'm just doing a
[34:03] general quotation here but I've heard
[34:05] brother Branham say this he said if we
[34:07] say we have the Holy Spirit but the Holy
[34:09] Spirit can't convict us of our little
[34:10] sins on a daily basis then what good is
[34:12] it for he's there to catch us on every
[34:16] little thing that we can light up our
[34:17] entire lives with God's Word God's
[34:20] interested in the little details of our
[34:22] life okay Rebecca can you read verse 11
[34:38] Pacey I think okay so look what he did
[34:46] he he killed the King and then he kills
[34:47] everybody else in the family now to make
[34:51] a long story short he ends up set he
[34:56] ruled for seven long years no seven days
[35:01] so his his conspiracy wasn't very
[35:04] fruitful he ruled for seven days and the
[35:08] Bible said later on in verse 9 in verse
[35:09] 20 that is all the northern Israel this
[35:12] he was a northern king not a king of
[35:14] Judah northern King and he saw all of
[35:18] northern Israel they anointed Omri to be
[35:20] king instead of him and so on the
[35:23] seventh day he got upset about that and
[35:25] he burnt down the whole king's house and
[35:27] himself he committed suicide and burnt
[35:29] down the whole King's chambers and
[35:32] everything like that so Jezebel's using
[35:35] this and saying Jay you think you're
[35:38] gonna have peace like Zimri denied peace
[35:41] he conspired to get the throne you think
[35:44] you're gonna have peace oh look at that
[35:48] demon power my she tried to get Jay to
[35:51] think he wouldn't have peace after
[35:54] pouring out the wrath of God rather than
[35:57] repenting and focusing on herself she
[35:59] shifted the blame on him in other words
[36:02] she's saying you're gonna feel bad if
[36:03] you kill me but Jay who knew he was
[36:09] anointed to pour out the wrath of God he
[36:12] knew if I don't cut her off God's gonna
[36:15] cut me off right because we said this
[36:17] morning Zimri did not have peace because
[36:20] he came to power unlawfully so look what
[36:24] happened here is again a perfect example
[36:26] of Jezebel misinterpreting miss applying
[36:29] the Word of God she looks at a situation
[36:33] that was part of history and she miss
[36:35] applies the situation to her own
[36:38] situation right that's what that's what
[36:41] the Jezebel spirit always does they miss
[36:42] apply the Word of God like one time this
[36:48] this one just comes to my mind a
[36:50] marriage in divorce case where
[36:52] somebody said well has you heiress could
[36:54] put away Vashti so that means I can put
[36:57] away my wife and marry another and that
[37:00] person's marriage second mayor they got
[37:01] married a second time it fell apart and
[37:03] the the the wife left the message left
[37:06] everything and you see they didn't have
[37:09] the Word of God they miss apply that and
[37:12] I prayed about this and said Lord Isis
[37:14] and the Holy Spirit showed me in the
[37:16] Book of Jeremiah where God told Jeremiah
[37:19] he said if you marry and put somebody
[37:23] away you could never take him back he
[37:24] said but I can do that
[37:26] I'm just paraphrasing but God said I
[37:28] will do that I'll put away Israel but
[37:30] I'll bring her back and so in other
[37:32] words the Bible says that God is saying
[37:34] I'm the only one that can do that New
[37:37] Testament people can't do that I'm the
[37:39] only one that can do that and so the
[37:42] Holy Spirit showed me that that was a
[37:43] real blessing in my heart so does this
[37:45] now make more sense I hope this is
[37:48] helpful
[37:48] this is why Jay Jay who doesn't skip a
[37:52] beat he looks up there and said who's on
[37:53] my side
[37:54] you listen you're on one side of the
[37:56] other you're on either the Jezebel side
[37:59] although all the churches are saved all
[38:00] the churches are go in heaven or you're
[38:02] with the message of the hour the small
[38:03] little minority I'm one of God's chosen
[38:06] for you praise the Lord
[38:07] I'm taking my way with God's a spice
[38:09] view there's a bigger Church in Akron
[38:11] that preached this message I go support
[38:12] them I say that all the time but since
[38:15] there is it will just be a little small
[38:17] minority praise God because we're
[38:19] standing with the Word of God that's
[38:21] right to see this was not a parallel
[38:24] Zimri was not a parallel to G who cuz G
[38:28] who was doing it lawfully by the
[38:30] anointing of Elijah spirit of God but
[38:34] our other friend there did not Zimri did
[38:37] not and maybe I shouldn't say friend but
[38:39] the other man did not do it lawfully he
[38:42] did it in a conspiracy okay so does that
[38:46] help to see any Jezebel spirit Church
[38:50] you see what do they do they fail to
[38:51] repent themselves and they shift the
[38:53] blame to other people they try to put
[38:56] people on a guilt trip it's really you
[38:58] know sister Connie it's really your
[38:59] fault you know Kristin you know it's
[39:02] really your fault and you should not
[39:04] have done that and you're gonna you're
[39:06] not
[39:06] peace with God you know oh that devil
[39:09] slick isn't he her last chance to save
[39:12] her life what does she do try to give
[39:13] meat you make you feel guilty that's why
[39:16] the Bible says if you confess your sins
[39:18] he's faithful and just to forgive you
[39:19] and we've got to remember that if I say
[39:22] God forgive me and you mean it God has
[39:24] forgiven you praise God we cannot live
[39:27] in self condemnation because this is the
[39:29] end this is the approach of the Jezebel
[39:30] spirit tries to rule keep her Kingdom
[39:33] trying to exalt herself above man and
[39:36] she puts the blame on the real man of
[39:38] God all right now hope that was a help
[39:42] that really helped me this week I
[39:43] thought now it all finally makes sense
[39:45] praise the Lord I never understood that
[39:47] okay now I would like to put this up
[39:54] here so Malachi can you switch over my
[39:59] desire is to go through let's go through
[40:01] abominations and rightly dividing the
[40:03] Old Testament it's been about three
[40:05] years since I preached on this I don't
[40:07] know if Fang and Bo were here when I
[40:08] hear brother bang when I preach on
[40:10] abominations I preach two sermons on
[40:13] 2015 so if you yeah if we can't remember
[40:17] maybe it's good that we go over it again
[40:20] so I wanted to cover that Jezebel and
[40:23] Zimri now chapter 2 of the book is gonna
[40:26] be on called how to apply Old Testament
[40:28] scripture to the New Testament now some
[40:31] of these are real familiar but let's
[40:35] just state this again
[40:36] the Bible says st. Peter and st. Paul
[40:39] both wrote that we must learn from the
[40:42] Old Testament Paul said that we can
[40:46] learn from Israel's journey through the
[40:49] wilderness and 1st Corinthians chapter
[40:51] 10 and all scripture I remember that
[40:54] says all Scripture is useful for
[40:56] doctrine reproof correction and
[40:57] instruction and righteousness all
[41:00] scripture now the trouble is that people
[41:02] don't rightly divide the word the right
[41:05] way and so a man of God has to see the
[41:08] whole Word of God and he's got to
[41:09] rightly divided he's got to cut this and
[41:11] say this applies to the bride this
[41:13] applies to the foolish virgin this
[41:15] applies to the Jew this applies to the
[41:18] make believer this this
[41:19] applies to the unbeliever or this no
[41:22] longer applies anymore so that's the
[41:24] that's the bet that's the gift of God
[41:26] today so in my studies now I could be
[41:29] wrong in other words I've got room to
[41:31] grow but I right now I can see there's
[41:33] five categories that we divide Old
[41:35] Testament scripture into we divide it
[41:38] into ceremonial laws that the priests
[41:40] would keep but we're no longer under
[41:43] that anymore so those are no longer in
[41:45] effect for Gentiles other moral laws
[41:50] that were there's some more laws that
[41:52] were not under anymore and I'm gonna
[41:54] give you some examples now a third group
[41:57] is this is the one that we've got to be
[41:59] careful of Old Testament laws that are
[42:01] still in effect today in other words the
[42:05] holy nature of God in the Old Testament
[42:07] he despised the sin and he still
[42:10] despises that sin today and then there's
[42:13] another category where you can take a
[42:15] scripture and it's really not a law or
[42:16] anything but it's an allegory and we can
[42:18] learn from an allegory which is like a
[42:21] type you can learn from a type and then
[42:24] there's other Scripture that's not
[42:25] really a law of the Old Testament it's
[42:26] just a prophecy and then that is a
[42:29] direct prophecy that we have to be able
[42:32] to apply to our lives today okay does
[42:36] that help by God's grace and I think
[42:39] you'll see as we go through these what
[42:41] I'm talking about here now I'm not gonna
[42:45] spend much time but I'm gonna go through
[42:46] ceremonial laws in Hebrew 7 the Bible
[42:49] says the blood of bulls and goats is
[42:51] done away with we have one sacrifice now
[42:53] it's Jesus Christ so I'm not gonna spend
[42:56] much time on that other but let's go to
[43:00] Hebrews 10 let's go to Hebrews 10 and I
[43:02] want to show you where the scripture
[43:02] says that we're under the new priesthood
[43:04] I know the last time I preached on the
[43:10] priesthood and marriage requirements and
[43:12] ministers I know that's third some
[43:13] feathers but that's fine I mean if
[43:16] people don't believe the Bible or maybe
[43:18] they can't see it that's fine you know
[43:20] if they can't see what what I can see
[43:21] that's fine
[43:23] but I want to I want to show you that
[43:26] the Bible says that the priesthood is
[43:28] changed
[43:34] so hebrews chapter 10
[43:39] now i'm not finding the scripture so I'm
[43:41] sorry I gotta go look it up real quick /
[43:43] me he I'm sorry it's Hebrews 7 12
[43:52] forgive me I'm sorry I thought was
[43:54] Hebrews 10 my fault
[43:55] Hebrews 7 12 pardon me so in other words
[44:01] what we're saying is the believer today
[44:03] is not under the Arion ik priesthood
[44:06] when brother Branham says that clearer
[44:08] than the church age book he said that's
[44:10] what the deeds of the Nicolaitans was
[44:12] all about Christians supposed to
[44:15] Christians that would try to do a
[44:17] headship where men rule over men that's
[44:21] getting back into the Aaronic system or
[44:24] how preachers can only come out of
[44:27] seminaries you know this idea something
[44:29] like that so let's look at the scripture
[44:33] here Hebrews 7:10 I'm sorry 712 for the
[44:37] priesthood being changed there is made
[44:39] of necessity a change also of the law
[44:43] okay so the priests it has changed we're
[44:46] not under the air in priests it anymore
[44:49] we're under the Melchizedek Priesthood
[44:51] and it's a good thing we are because if
[44:55] we were under the error in priesthood
[44:57] st. Paul could not have been a preacher
[44:58] because he had eye trouble I remember
[45:01] that and Leviticus Leviticus says no
[45:03] priests can have eye trouble he can have
[45:05] no blemish in his eyes but there's times
[45:06] Paul couldn't see very well does the
[45:09] aren't you glad you're not under the
[45:10] Levitical ceremonies anymore we're under
[45:13] the Melchizedek Priesthood now so that
[45:17] that's one example that's one example so
[45:20] that's a ceremonial all the ceremonial
[45:23] laws are no longer in effect the
[45:25] physical requirements for ministers the
[45:27] hereditary requirements of priesthood
[45:29] you have to be born of the tribe of
[45:30] Aaron and Levi sacrificing animals we're
[45:35] no longer under that now let's go
[45:38] through some examples of laws we're not
[45:40] under huh me no we're no longer under
[45:42] circumcision anymore that's
[45:45] in Galatians 615 prohibited foods in
[45:48] Acts chapter 10 9 through 16 we're not
[45:52] under the diet of the Jews anymore God
[45:55] showed Peter three visions and said rise
[45:57] and eat and Peter says no Lord can you
[45:59] imagine town the Lord no right to his
[46:01] face no he's like no Lord no I said rise
[46:04] keone no I've never touched anything
[46:07] unclean rise killing eat no Lord he was
[46:10] it was so ingrained in him I just can't
[46:12] I couldn't eat that I just can't do that
[46:15] it's against my religion
[46:16] and he even turned on the voice of the
[46:18] Holy Spirit but I'm sure he learned
[46:20] later on also another example and if you
[46:24] have some examples you can share him
[46:25] with me afterwards I like to hear him
[46:26] too the instant death penalty for
[46:30] blasphemy was no longer in effect
[46:32] because Paul was a blasphemer and the
[46:35] Christians didn't go out and kill him
[46:38] right Paul said I was a blasphemer but I
[46:41] did it in ignorance but the scripture
[46:43] says in Leviticus 24 14 anyone who
[46:45] blasphemes should die right there on the
[46:48] spot so see these are just you and what
[46:53] you church what we have to do is we have
[46:54] to be patient enough and search the
[46:57] scripture deep enough to find the answer
[47:00] in other words we have to care if people
[47:02] ask you what do you feel about this what
[47:03] do you feel about that we have to care
[47:05] enough to actually look in the scripture
[47:07] we have to care enough to answer
[47:09] questions in other words we can't get
[47:13] complacent well brother Jesse this is
[47:14] what I've done my whole life I can't
[47:16] grow anymore yeah this is all I can do
[47:20] now I don't want to read the Bible
[47:21] anymore we don't want that attitude here
[47:24] we want to grow in grace and knowledge
[47:26] of the Lord so those are three clear
[47:30] laws that are no longer in effect that
[47:34] we can prove by the scripture now and
[47:37] then I listened in the chapter listed
[47:38] three that are still in effect and here
[47:41] they are the first one is nine out of
[47:45] ten commandments are still in effect the
[47:48] only one that's not is the literal
[47:49] Sabbath day that's the only one that's
[47:52] not in effect the next one is
[47:56] abominations there's many abominations
[47:58] that are still in effect today and the
[48:01] third one is tithing tithing is still in
[48:03] effect today so those are three clear
[48:09] examples now we may get to those in just
[48:13] a minute but let's go through
[48:14] allegorical truth let's go to Galatians
[48:15] 4 21 now we can we can use some of the
[48:20] Old Testament Scriptures helpful for us
[48:21] and we can divide it into this category
[48:23] of allegory or types and shadows so
[48:26] Galatians go to Galatians 4 21 maybe I
[48:31] can go back to Malachi and Elijah for
[48:32] this one okay guys all right thank you
[48:37] because we can't say well or blanket
[48:40] statement all we don't need the Old
[48:41] Testament anymore we're not under the
[48:43] law anymore we're not under the Old
[48:45] Testament we'll get to that in a minute
[48:47] it's true in a way we're not under the
[48:48] law but another way we are under the law
[48:51] but it's the law of the Spirit so we're
[48:54] just under a different law the law of
[48:56] the Spirit so Galatians 4 21 now chyron
[49:01] don't you read 21 and 22 please ok logic
[49:16] can you read 23 and 24 please
[49:31] a Liguria okay so the idea of Ishmael
[49:47] and Isaac was given to us as an allegory
[49:50] we can learn from that Scripture today
[49:52] that's a type Ishmael was born of the
[49:55] flesh but Isaac was born of the promise
[50:00] praise God
[50:01] see Ishmael was a result of Abraham
[50:06] trying to bring God's Word to pass
[50:08] himself but Isaac is a result of waiting
[50:11] on God's promise and so this scripture
[50:15] you know the story of Isaac and Ishmael
[50:16] can be placed under here that's the
[50:18] allegorical truth that we can learn from
[50:20] everybody see that by God's grace okay
[50:23] hope that's quite clear another one is
[50:27] the idea of Jesus and Joseph were both
[50:31] both sold for pieces of silver but we're
[50:33] not gonna read that Joseph was sold for
[50:35] twenty and Jesus for thirty
[50:36] that's an allegorical truth it's a
[50:38] foreshadowing of Christ to come so see
[50:43] we can use those Old Testament
[50:44] Scriptures they're very important to us
[50:48] now another thing is that allegory
[50:51] sometimes are prophetic like with the
[50:54] story of Joseph in Egypt I remember when
[50:58] he revealed himself to the breslin where
[51:00] was his bride at church she was put out
[51:04] she was put away so when Jesus reveals
[51:07] himself to the 144,000 the bride is
[51:10] nowhere to be seen
[51:10] she's not on the earth she's at the
[51:12] marriage supper so see that's why we
[51:15] need or allegorical truths that's why we
[51:17] need types and shadows
[51:19] because they teach us about the Lord and
[51:23] it allows Jesus to reveal things to us
[51:26] which other you know intellectual people
[51:29] of the Bible they can't see that because
[51:31] they say well the Old Testament doesn't
[51:32] apply to us or they don't spend time
[51:34] back there but how many know the Holy
[51:36] Spirit wrote that word and the Holy
[51:38] Spirit wants to speak to us through that
[51:40] Old Testament amen
[51:42] hallelujah
[51:44] praise God the next example is direct
[51:47] prophecy
[51:48] okay so Lydia and Rebecca maybe Liddy
[51:55] why don't you go to first Corinthians
[51:56] 15:54 first Corinthians 15:54 this is
[52:00] just a striking that's always been a
[52:01] striking example to me
[52:03] first Corinthians 15:54 now this of
[52:11] course is the portion on the rapture
[52:13] all right so lady can you read 54 please
[52:28] did you ever think about that where did
[52:31] that statement death SWAT up in victory
[52:33] come from it came from the writings of
[52:36] Isaiah eight hundred years before Christ
[52:39] was born
[52:40] Isaiah got inspired of the Holy Spirit
[52:42] and said death will be swallowed up in
[52:44] victory now let's go read it let's have
[52:47] Rebecca and everybody let's go to isaiah
[52:49] 25:8 isaiah 25:8 can you imagine paul
[52:55] would read those Old Testament Old
[52:56] Testament text and you and I would have
[53:00] never caught the rapture in Isaiah 25 we
[53:04] would not have been looking for the
[53:05] rapture but a prophet reads that and
[53:07] that thought is inspired it jumps off
[53:10] the pages and he picks it up he's
[53:12] reading Isaiah 25 you said this is the
[53:14] rapture this is what's gonna happen at
[53:16] the second coming of Jesus Christ amen
[53:18] glory death is going to be swallowed up
[53:22] in victory and nobody else can see that
[53:24] in the Book of Isaiah but a prophet of
[53:26] God amen
[53:28] isaiah 25:8 okay Rebecca whenever you're
[53:31] ready
[53:48] amen praise the Lord Isaiah wrote this
[53:51] actually in 712 BC so about 800 years
[53:55] god bless you sir
[53:57] amen now who would have thought Church
[54:01] who would have thought that the rapture
[54:02] would be laying in Isaiah 25 the rapture
[54:05] of all these surrounding scriptures the
[54:08] Holy Spirit takes just that one pulls it
[54:10] out and said this is referring to the
[54:12] rapture so see that's why we got to be
[54:14] sensitive to the Holy Spirit we could be
[54:16] reading and the Holy Spirit could reveal
[54:18] something that applies to our day and it
[54:20] could be direct prophecy for us but if
[54:23] we've never understood it
[54:25] we might be hesitant to believe it so we
[54:27] have to wait for the anointing or the
[54:29] influence of the Holy Spirit we have to
[54:31] wait for the direction of the Holy
[54:32] Spirit to guide us to more direct
[54:35] prophecy that's already laying in
[54:36] Scripture in front of us amen look at
[54:39] verse 6 though and in this mountain
[54:41] shall the Lord of hosts make unto all
[54:43] people a feast of fat things a feast of
[54:45] wines and of the leaves of fat things
[54:47] full of marrow of wines on the LEAs well
[54:51] refined and he will destroy in this
[54:54] mount in the face of the covering cast
[54:55] over all the people and the veil that is
[54:58] spread before all nations and he will
[55:01] swallow up death in victory so he's
[55:04] speaking about a time where there's
[55:06] gonna be wine flowing on mountains the
[55:10] mountain of the New Jerusalem praise God
[55:12] and then he starts talking about how all
[55:16] the the veil that's over the earth is
[55:18] gonna be taken away God's gonna take
[55:21] that veil away and everybody is gonna
[55:23] see him amen he's going to destroy that
[55:27] this covering that's cast over all the
[55:29] people this this sin disease God is
[55:32] going to destroy that what's he gonna do
[55:33] he's gonna send fire burn it over and
[55:35] make a new heavens and a new earth
[55:37] that's right who would have thought the
[55:39] rapture was right there he will swallow
[55:41] up death in victory I don't know yeah
[55:45] that's why I love the holy spirit amen
[55:47] he just picks that up and said this is
[55:49] for your day Paul prophesied now another
[55:53] example is the new heavens and new earth
[55:54] I'm not gonna go over that though we're
[55:55] pretty familiar with that Isaiah 65 17
[55:58] in second Peter 3:13 another example is
[56:01] David in Psalm 16:10 I will not suffer
[56:05] thine Holy One to see corruption direct
[56:07] prophecy and then acts 2:27 Peter says
[56:12] that death I'm sorry Peter says that
[56:14] Jesus was God's Holy One and he did not
[56:17] see any corruption so direct prophecy
[56:20] these aren't really ceremonial laws or
[56:22] laws they're just they're their words
[56:24] their songs and it's prophecy that the
[56:26] Holy Spirit wants to fulfill today amen
[56:29] now let's go the next one here two or
[56:34] three witnesses I don't think we need to
[56:37] cover the homosexuality we know that's
[56:38] the sin in the Old Testament New
[56:40] Testament
[56:40] how about honoring children honoring
[56:42] their parents somebody know that's in
[56:43] the New Testament okay
[56:45] fusions chapter 6 how about tithing does
[56:48] anyone want to see tithing again in the
[56:49] New Testament you're gonna see that no
[56:52] okay
[56:53] caris do you want to I'm sure you do I
[56:54] know you do let me go that real quick
[56:57] first there's five reasons that still
[56:59] applies the New Testament never abolish
[57:01] is tithing second Jesus said tithing was
[57:04] the least of the commands which means
[57:05] it's still command third Jesus never
[57:09] stopped anyone from paying ties fourth
[57:12] st. Paul taught ministers who preach the
[57:15] gospel should live of the gospel in 1st
[57:17] Corinthians chapter 9
[57:18] fifth Hebrews 7 verses 2 & 3 Abraham the
[57:23] father of faith paid ties without a
[57:25] written command of God and the Bible
[57:26] said we're the children of Abraham when
[57:29] we have faith in Jesus Christ
[57:31] okay so that one asked us five witnesses
[57:35] now let's go over this thought that
[57:37] we're not under the law now it's true
[57:40] we're not under the Old Testament law as
[57:42] far as like Ishmael we're not trying to
[57:44] keep the word of our self how many knows
[57:47] your flesh cannot keep the Word of God
[57:49] how many know that your flesh is gonna
[57:51] fail every time that's why you need to
[57:53] live by the faith of Christ that's why
[57:56] you got to get up every day die to
[57:58] yourself say Holy Spirit and power me
[58:00] and anoint me give me the desire to do
[58:03] what's right
[58:05] give me your desire your faith to obey
[58:08] the Word of God and if you do that now
[58:10] you're not walking according to the
[58:12] Old Testament law but you're walking in
[58:14] the law of the Spirit which is the law
[58:17] that we're under so let's go to Romans 8
[58:19] we'll see that in the scripture so I
[58:22] take a couple pages in the book
[58:24] Lord willing like I said if we get it
[58:26] published and I show this we show how we
[58:32] are under the law of the Holy Spirit so
[58:38] people say oh we're not in the law we're
[58:41] not gonna law well yeah to some degree
[58:42] you're right we're not under the curse
[58:44] of the law the curse of laws if you
[58:46] break one word you're guilty of all of
[58:48] it the Bible said Jesus took that curse
[58:50] away from us amen we're not under the
[58:53] curse of the law but we are under the
[58:55] law of the Spirit so what the Holy
[58:57] Spirit wrote there in the Old Testament
[58:59] that was holiness holy Living God wants
[59:02] us to keep that today we are under that
[59:05] law the holiness of God amen
[59:10] Romans 8 see some people like I said
[59:17] well all of us all of us are without
[59:18] understanding all of us needed to
[59:20] understand this by God's grace Romans
[59:23] 8:1 was it start there
[59:24] Malachi and logic can you help us out
[59:26] here Malak I won't read verse 1 and 2
[59:44] amen Church you should be happy if
[59:47] you're walking by the spirit you have no
[59:49] condemnation today
[59:50] there's nothing Satan can put on you
[59:52] because you're walking in the spear in
[59:54] other words you're obeying the Holy
[59:55] Spirit you're not under the law of sin
[59:58] and death I'm not I'm not a slave and
[1:00:01] I'm not trying to earn my salvation I'm
[1:00:03] already saying they men I'm walking in
[1:00:06] the spirit praise God Satan can't
[1:00:09] condemn me because I've confessed all my
[1:00:11] sins and when I'm wrong I've talked
[1:00:13] about it anything I've done wrong I told
[1:00:15] Jesus he's the most important one to
[1:00:16] tell about it
[1:00:18] but see the law of the spirit of life
[1:00:21] that's the law were under now the Holy
[1:00:23] Spirit law
[1:00:25] Alijah can you read three and four
[1:00:26] please
[1:00:51] amen thank you sir
[1:00:53] so see that what the Bible say the
[1:00:55] righteousness of the law is fulfilled in
[1:00:57] us how many member when Paul wrote that
[1:00:59] the law was holy the law was good he
[1:01:02] said but I'm a carnal I'm sold under sin
[1:01:04] and the things that I want to do I can't
[1:01:06] do remember that interest I think it's
[1:01:08] later on and it's previously in Romans
[1:01:10] chapter 6 but Paul's saying that's what
[1:01:13] I'm walking the flesh right but see when
[1:01:16] we walk in the spirit we're fulfilling
[1:01:18] the righteousness of the law remember
[1:01:20] jesus said when he got baptized he said
[1:01:22] it becometh us to fulfill all
[1:01:23] righteousness God is God wants his
[1:01:27] people to do the right thing to do the
[1:01:30] holy thing to walk and righteousness the
[1:01:32] only way to do that is to obey the Holy
[1:01:34] Spirit and that will never lead you away
[1:01:36] from the word it all leads you into the
[1:01:38] word that's exactly right
[1:01:42] so the blanket statement all we're not
[1:01:44] under the law well yeah that's true to
[1:01:45] some degree we're not trying to earn
[1:01:47] salvation we're not under the curse of
[1:01:49] all that's true but we are under the law
[1:01:51] of the Holy Spirit I'm you understand
[1:01:53] that and anyone who rejects the law of
[1:01:56] the Holy Spirit will reject eternal life
[1:01:57] because the Holy Spirit is eternal life
[1:02:00] it's exactly right that's the scripture
[1:02:02] now there's a lot of blanket statements
[1:02:08] that are true like here's a blanket
[1:02:09] statement that is true Jesus Christ is
[1:02:11] the only way to the Father and no one
[1:02:13] gets to heaven except through Christ and
[1:02:15] we know that that's a blanket statement
[1:02:17] that's all true the Bible says that he's
[1:02:21] an a only one to be saved here's other
[1:02:25] blanket statements Lord willing I've
[1:02:27] also put him on my video to know person
[1:02:31] the New Testament was ever a record as
[1:02:32] being baptized in the titles father son
[1:02:33] Holy Ghost all recorded baptisms were in
[1:02:37] the name of Jesus Christ Lord Jesus or
[1:02:39] Lord God never asked one woman one godly
[1:02:43] woman to cut or trim her hair god never
[1:02:46] asked I'm sorry that God never called
[1:02:47] himself three persons Jesus was never
[1:02:49] called the second person Jesus never
[1:02:51] called a woman to be an apostle the
[1:02:52] Apostles never asked anyone if they
[1:02:54] wanted to invite Jesus into their hearts
[1:02:57] what they say they said repent and be
[1:03:00] baptized
[1:03:00] repent of your sins turn from your sins
[1:03:04] and now you can serve Christ so see
[1:03:07] there are there are blanket statements
[1:03:09] that are true but church were the only
[1:03:10] ones I believe in the whole world that
[1:03:12] can make true blanket statement like
[1:03:14] this that are not only true but they're
[1:03:16] thus saith the Lord which means we have
[1:03:19] a prophet that has come and told us this
[1:03:21] is thus saith the Bible we're the only
[1:03:23] ones that have that amen glory glory
[1:03:27] okay give me 15 more minutes here I'm
[1:03:30] gonna try to do about an hour now I need
[1:03:34] some readers here let's close with
[1:03:34] abominations here so I did about two
[1:03:40] pages on abominations okay any of the
[1:03:44] children know what's about what's an
[1:03:45] abomination mean what is the word we
[1:03:47] mean is anybody know anybody know Haman
[1:03:52] you know it's a sin
[1:03:56] it actually means a disgusting thing it
[1:04:01] means a disgusting thing like an unclean
[1:04:03] a really gross thing that's what
[1:04:05] abomination is it's an unclean thing
[1:04:07] let's go to Deuteronomy 1231 Lydia and
[1:04:10] Rebecca once you get ready here we'll
[1:04:12] have you read next
[1:04:13] Deuteronomy 1231 God literally says
[1:04:18] listen what he literally says in
[1:04:20] Deuteronomy 1231
[1:04:25] whenever you're ready Lydia I'm not
[1:04:27] there yet but Deuteronomy 1231 okay this
[1:04:47] is speaking of course child sacrifice
[1:04:49] but notice they did according to their
[1:04:51] abominations which the LORD thy God
[1:04:53] hated so that God sets a precedence
[1:04:57] right there a pattern he is going to
[1:04:58] hate every abomination every disgusting
[1:05:01] thing he's going to hate so we have laws
[1:05:04] we had moral laws all these things now
[1:05:06] of course you know abominations fall
[1:05:08] under laws that are still in effect
[1:05:09] their commands that God's given us that
[1:05:12] we have to be careful there are hundreds
[1:05:14] sixty-six times the Bible mentions
[1:05:16] abominations 157 the Old Testament and
[1:05:19] nine in the New Testament so there's a
[1:05:21] lot more in the Old Testament than the
[1:05:22] New Testament and I went through every
[1:05:25] one again
[1:05:26] and I found most of the abominations in
[1:05:29] the Old Testament are still abomination
[1:05:31] in the New Testament fact almost all of
[1:05:33] them except for three I found that's a
[1:05:36] lot so there's only three that are no
[1:05:39] longer abomination so as a preacher I'm
[1:05:43] supposed to rightly divide the word if
[1:05:44] somebody asked me are we under the law
[1:05:45] anymore
[1:05:46] well we're under the law of the Holy
[1:05:48] Spirit and I find in my studies that 9
[1:05:52] out of 10 commandments are still sin the
[1:05:53] New Testament and almost every
[1:05:55] abomination except for three are still
[1:05:57] abomination the New Testament so we
[1:06:01] can't say I don't need the Old Testament
[1:06:03] anymore we desperately need the Old
[1:06:04] Testament it's part of God's inspired
[1:06:06] Word all Scripture is useful to make us
[1:06:09] what perfect unto every good work amen
[1:06:12] glory now here's the three that are no
[1:06:16] longer in effect
[1:06:17] the first one is eating a peace offering
[1:06:20] on the third day if you eat if you left
[1:06:22] a peace offering sit out for three days
[1:06:24] and you eat it on the third day God said
[1:06:26] that's an abomination probably because
[1:06:28] of health reasons
[1:06:28] if you leave how food that long without
[1:06:30] refrigeration you know but it was an
[1:06:33] abomination and that's in Leviticus 718
[1:06:36] now the reason since I'm short on time
[1:06:38] I'm just gonna go quickly the reason
[1:06:42] that's done away with is because the
[1:06:43] Bible says that Christ is our offering
[1:06:45] and Christ is our peace now and we
[1:06:49] already showed from Hebrews 7 that we're
[1:06:51] not under the law bulls and goats
[1:06:52] anymore we're not under the physical
[1:06:54] sacrifice we're under the sacrifice of
[1:06:56] Christ and the Bible said we have peace
[1:07:00] with God through our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:03] not through animal sacrifice okay the
[1:07:07] second abomination which is no longer in
[1:07:09] effect is offering a blemished animal
[1:07:12] sacrifice that's in Deuteronomy 17 1 so
[1:07:15] if you brought a lamb but it had a
[1:07:16] blemish or a broken leg or you know it
[1:07:18] was bleeding or something like that or I
[1:07:20] don't know it wasn't the right sacrifice
[1:07:22] it was an abomination in other words God
[1:07:25] is saying don't bring me some wimpy
[1:07:27] offering
[1:07:28] no don't bring me some half-hearted
[1:07:30] sacrifice give me your best amen that's
[1:07:34] what I believe God's asking us on Sunday
[1:07:35] give us our give God our best worship on
[1:07:38] Sunday our best on Wednesday give
[1:07:40] everything we got to God we must bring
[1:07:43] our best sacrifice amen that's why I
[1:07:45] give Church the most I give them a
[1:07:47] church than most of my attention the
[1:07:49] most of my energy and if I'm worn out on
[1:07:51] Monday hallelujah I'm worn out for Jesus
[1:07:53] amen
[1:07:54] but Christ is gonna get them my best
[1:07:57] sacrifice no so let me say this the
[1:08:02] offering a blemish animal sacrifice is
[1:08:04] no longer in effect but haami no we must
[1:08:06] offer a true spiritual sacrifice in the
[1:08:08] New Testament if not it's a domination
[1:08:12] to God now that's true because of John
[1:08:14] 4:24 jesus said the father is looking
[1:08:17] for worshipers who worship in spirit and
[1:08:18] truth and in Matthew 15:9 jesus said if
[1:08:22] you teach for doctrines the commandments
[1:08:24] of men your worship is in vain okay so
[1:08:29] there are spiritual sacrifices if you
[1:08:31] offer these things to God and there's a
[1:08:33] blemish in their spiritual blemish God
[1:08:35] does not receive it so spiritually that
[1:08:38] law applies today yes because the Bible
[1:08:43] says present your bodies a living
[1:08:44] sacrifice in Romans 12:1 and 2 okay and
[1:08:50] then the third abomination is the
[1:08:53] unclean foods we already talked about
[1:08:55] that that's in Leviticus 11 I'm sorry
[1:08:57] let me guess 9/11 243 all those foods
[1:09:01] that Peter can eat God says now you can
[1:09:03] eat them now to go along with that
[1:09:08] there's a balance there how many know
[1:09:09] there's a balance even to that the Bible
[1:09:11] said you cannot eat blood or strangled
[1:09:14] animals in the New Testament or the
[1:09:16] third one is foods that are dedicated to
[1:09:18] an idol now that did really doesn't
[1:09:20] impact us today but the days of paw I
[1:09:22] was reading on that yesterday they must
[1:09:24] have went into restaurants and the
[1:09:25] restaurants must have had idols in them
[1:09:27] or something and they the paul told him
[1:09:30] it said if you sit down and eat this
[1:09:32] meat as offered to idols he said it
[1:09:35] doesn't bother your conscience but what
[1:09:37] about the people around you
[1:09:38] young weak Christians that are sitting
[1:09:41] around you and they
[1:09:42] - you eat meat that was sacrificed to an
[1:09:44] idol he said you'll cause him to stumble
[1:09:47] he said in he said you could cause your
[1:09:49] brother to perish can you imagine that
[1:09:51] because of me and my Liberty I thought I
[1:09:54] could eat this oh I'm a Christian I know
[1:09:55] this isn't a sin I know this isn't
[1:09:57] really I know there's no God that this
[1:09:59] is really sacrificed - I'll just eat it
[1:10:01] anyway but the Bible says if you don't
[1:10:04] think about the needs of others you can
[1:10:06] cause people to perish spiritually how
[1:10:07] many know that and Paul says when you do
[1:10:10] that you not only sin against the weak
[1:10:12] Christian you sit against Christ that's
[1:10:15] the scripture so that one really doesn't
[1:10:17] impact us right now as far as I can see
[1:10:19] can any brothers think of any ideas like
[1:10:20] where we eat meat that sacrificed to
[1:10:23] idols you think of that I mean would you
[1:10:27] consider a hamburger at bw3 sacrificed
[1:10:30] soon I don't know I don't know I just
[1:10:33] know you I'd be careful what kind of
[1:10:34] atmosphere you go around no yes we
[1:10:38] wouldn't go in a place like that let me
[1:10:39] close with these last few thoughts here
[1:10:41] so that's the third one unclean foods
[1:10:43] that abomination has done away with but
[1:10:45] there is a balance you can't eat a
[1:10:47] strangled animal meat meat that's bloody
[1:10:49] I don't know and I don't know I that's
[1:10:52] something I got study too you know like
[1:10:53] oh I want a rare steak I don't know if
[1:10:55] that's wrong or not Church I don't know
[1:10:57] I don't know I like rare steaks I'll be
[1:11:00] honest I prefer steaks I don't like I'm
[1:11:02] too bloody but you know to me I just I
[1:11:04] don't know so I need to look up that
[1:11:05] I've never studied that so if I'm wrong
[1:11:07] forgive me if I do if I'm doing wrong
[1:11:09] it's because I'm ignorant of it but like
[1:11:11] I said we ought to be willing to examine
[1:11:13] our lives more closely to the Word of
[1:11:15] God okay now the last thing here's a
[1:11:21] list of abominations that are still
[1:11:23] detestable to God I briefly went over
[1:11:26] this last week I'm gonna go a little
[1:11:27] slower because I still got seven minutes
[1:11:29] and I'll try to close in seven minutes
[1:11:31] and I think will be how I'll be happy to
[1:11:33] cover most of chapter two okay how many
[1:11:41] know that
[1:11:41] justifying sin is an abomination let me
[1:11:44] know that when you say this sin it's
[1:11:47] okay to do this soon it's okay for me to
[1:11:49] dissent when you do that you're
[1:11:51] committing an abomination well it's okay
[1:11:54] in my case to do this it's okay for me
[1:11:56] to lie it's okay for me to steal it's
[1:11:59] okay for me to commit adultery or
[1:12:00] fornication when you justify yourself
[1:12:03] it's an abomination the sight of God
[1:12:04] when you're in sin now now that's in
[1:12:07] Jude verse four let's go to Jude 4 and
[1:12:10] who we at liddie or Malachi I'm sorry
[1:12:11] Lydia wait you yeah see this is Rebecca
[1:12:15] okay Becca can go to Jude for thank you
[1:12:20] the Bible clearly teaches us when you
[1:12:22] say that sin is acceptable unto God
[1:12:28] that's an abomination like my little
[1:12:30] girls walked up to me yesterday after my
[1:12:31] mom left and said daddy can mommy be can
[1:12:33] your mommy be safe she cuts her hair
[1:12:35] wears shorts wears makeup
[1:12:38] and I said I don't know I don't know I
[1:12:42] said God is gonna have to have mercy on
[1:12:45] her she doesn't repent and change your
[1:12:46] ways God is gonna have to have mercy on
[1:12:48] her I said because she's sitting and I
[1:12:52] said I just told my children right was
[1:12:54] it Karras or haven which one was Haven
[1:12:55] in here she's not Karras was a human
[1:12:58] that said that I think it was you yeah
[1:13:01] and they come up real sincere and I want
[1:13:04] to be sincere with them I said but I
[1:13:06] have this consolation the thief on the
[1:13:08] cross was a murderer and he just got
[1:13:10] done making fun of Jesus mocking Jesus
[1:13:13] when they're first came to the cross
[1:13:14] I've scripture on that but somehow in
[1:13:16] the matter of the hours he was on the
[1:13:18] cross he repents and he said Jesus is
[1:13:21] holy he's he's right just we deserve
[1:13:23] this and he said remember me when you
[1:13:26] come into your kingdom
[1:13:27] and I said God saved him so I said let's
[1:13:30] pray to God save grandma I think we
[1:13:32] prayed right there that God would save
[1:13:34] grandma you can't act like Jezebel I
[1:13:37] think you're gonna be saved right it's
[1:13:40] gonna take the mercy of God God is gonna
[1:13:43] have to mercy upon people and so we
[1:13:47] don't want it we don't want to justify
[1:13:48] sin we don't want to tell them oh it's
[1:13:50] okay if they wear shorts or it's okay if
[1:13:52] they wear pants or it's okay it's not
[1:13:54] okay and
[1:13:55] is gonna have to have mercy upon people
[1:13:58] and that's what we asked for that's why
[1:14:00] we should be the ones praying and
[1:14:03] sighing and crying for the abominations
[1:14:05] done in our families who else is gonna
[1:14:08] do it who's gonna be the job in here
[1:14:10] who's gonna be the job in here that
[1:14:11] offers sacrifices for your children or
[1:14:13] offer sacrifices for your family members
[1:14:16] we need some saints like Joel praise God
[1:14:18] now understand if someone's living in
[1:14:21] sin it's gonna have to be us it's gonna
[1:14:23] be our prayers so God will have mercy
[1:14:25] upon them
[1:14:26] someone's got to intercede for them
[1:14:27] they're not interceding for their self
[1:14:30] so we have to become priests amen we
[1:14:32] have to use the priestly role and
[1:14:34] intercede honey be God honored job
[1:14:38] sacrifice for his children but Graham
[1:14:40] said God did honor his sacrifice for his
[1:14:41] children and have got under his he's
[1:14:44] gotta honor yours too he's not a
[1:14:47] respecter of persons but the thing to do
[1:14:49] is trust in your sacrifice trust in the
[1:14:51] blood of Jesus sake put your trust in
[1:14:54] the blood of Jesus Christ all right
[1:14:56] we're back I'm sorry you got that Jude
[1:14:58] 1:4
[1:15:11] condemnation the Shiva sness thank you
[1:15:26] wonderful so the Bible said preachers
[1:15:29] who turn God's grace into a license to
[1:15:32] sin or ordained to be condemned so that
[1:15:37] proves it any any preacher anyone who
[1:15:39] justifies sin and cause it righteous is
[1:15:42] under the judgment of God so God still
[1:15:46] hates justifying sin now the next one's
[1:15:50] homosexuality there's three scriptures a
[1:15:52] New Testament that say it's wrong I
[1:15:53] don't think we need to go there I think
[1:15:54] we understand that idolatry and graven
[1:15:57] images are condemned in Galatians 5
[1:16:00] revelation 13 revelation 21 revelation
[1:16:04] 22
[1:16:04] so there's another abomination that's
[1:16:06] still sin sacrificing children is still
[1:16:13] abomination in Revelation 21:8 I don't
[1:16:15] remember that one oh it's murder yeah
[1:16:17] revelation 21:8 sorry I'm gonna go there
[1:16:19] I'll read that one our Malachi can you
[1:16:20] read that revelation 21:8 sir yeah it's
[1:16:27] murderers I believe yeah amen
[1:16:43] think of all these abortions Church I
[1:16:45] think of all this evil that's being done
[1:16:48] it's still an abomination people don't
[1:16:52] understand that witchcraft is also
[1:16:54] condemned in Galatians 5 20 and 21 Old
[1:16:57] Testament Bhama nation New Testament
[1:16:59] abomination cross-dressing now this is
[1:17:03] one Deuteronomy 20
[1:17:08] five we know cross-dressing abomination
[1:17:09] I am I'm using indirect scriptures to
[1:17:12] prove this one because there's nothing
[1:17:13] in the New Testament that condemns
[1:17:15] cross-dressing that I can find if you
[1:17:17] found it let me know because I want to
[1:17:18] preach it I want to share with the world
[1:17:20] but what I can find is that Jesus never
[1:17:23] broke the law so geez that means Jesus
[1:17:25] always wore men garments always and for
[1:17:29] some reason I wrote down John 829 let's
[1:17:31] go there John 829 and Elijah can you
[1:17:34] read that
[1:17:34] John 829 please I'm not sure I wrote
[1:17:39] this down
[1:17:39] I must had a good reason John 829 okay
[1:17:43] yeah yeah you read that okay so I just
[1:17:54] use indirect scriptures every understand
[1:17:55] that since I have no direct scriptures
[1:17:57] that say cross-dressing is wrong in the
[1:17:59] New Testament I have to use indirect
[1:18:00] scriptures where Jesus says I always do
[1:18:02] that which pleased the father I never
[1:18:04] broke any Old Testament command so it
[1:18:06] was pleasing to God for his own son
[1:18:08] never to put on women's clothes and so
[1:18:11] our women she never put on men's pants
[1:18:12] right men's clothes and our men should
[1:18:15] never dress like women right which is
[1:18:18] awful like at my school at Halloween
[1:18:20] time I see boys that dress up as girls
[1:18:21] and it's awful I just sit there and look
[1:18:23] at them and shake my head like that's
[1:18:26] awful that's what they're teaching them
[1:18:27] at this age that it's okay and that said
[1:18:31] worshiping with a wicked heart okay
[1:18:35] there's my timer so there's my 15
[1:18:36] minutes let's stand I better stop here
[1:18:39] this is what I'll do is I'll keep
[1:18:42] preaching while you stand so couple more
[1:18:45] minutes worshiping with the wicked heart
[1:18:48] even though you're worshiping is an
[1:18:50] abomination and this is found in Matthew
[1:18:52] 7 where Jesus says yeah you might have
[1:18:55] cast out devils you might done many
[1:18:56] wonderful works of my name but your
[1:18:57] worker of iniquity you never I never
[1:18:59] knew you depart from me you worker of
[1:19:01] iniquity they had to been worshiping
[1:19:03] because they were doing great things and
[1:19:04] not under the anointing of the Holy
[1:19:05] Spirit
[1:19:06] and Jesus has depart from me so they
[1:19:09] were worshiping with wicked hearts how
[1:19:13] many member diverse weights and measures
[1:19:14] the the financial people that would
[1:19:17] change the measure oh if I just if I if
[1:19:20] I decrease this or decrease
[1:19:21] this measure I can make a little more
[1:19:22] money that's called extortion and you
[1:19:26] can still go to jail for that today
[1:19:28] stealing people's money
[1:19:30] well extortionists clearly called sin in
[1:19:33] first corinthians 6:10 so that's still
[1:19:35] an abomination to steal people's money
[1:19:39] wicked thoughts wicked hearts wicked
[1:19:42] ways froward perverse hearts are all
[1:19:45] abominations and that's seen in acts 20
[1:19:48] 29 and 30 and there are seven
[1:19:52] abominations that are still abominations
[1:19:55] in proverbs 6 16 through 19 pride
[1:19:57] there's seven things the Lord doth hate
[1:19:59] abominable pride lying murder wicked
[1:20:03] thoughts pursuing mischief false witness
[1:20:06] and sowing discord and every single one
[1:20:08] of those can be shown the New Testament
[1:20:10] to be sin and abominations are you
[1:20:13] grateful for the Word of God today I'm
[1:20:16] grateful for a prophet that God sent us
[1:20:18] to help us rightly divide the word but
[1:20:20] now we know our prophet today is the
[1:20:21] Holy Spirit amen let's give Lord Rama
[1:20:24] pause amen and now as we close Church
[1:20:30] you know I'll be honest like there's
[1:20:31] some there's some Old Testament laws I
[1:20:33] don't sure I'm not sure about like
[1:20:34] cotton
[1:20:35] you know the Bible said there's certain
[1:20:36] materials you must wear I never even
[1:20:37] thought about these things and if you
[1:20:39] asked me after church I wouldn't know
[1:20:41] what to tell you so what would I have to
[1:20:42] do I would have to use the same laws
[1:20:44] that Paul placed in our scripture we'd
[1:20:48] have to look at that scripture and say
[1:20:49] was it right for me to wear this
[1:20:50] clothing nah I hope nobody asked me that
[1:20:52] though out there sad because I don't
[1:20:53] know but you'd have to have to study the
[1:20:56] scripture and try to understand these
[1:20:57] things and we know of course our prophet
[1:21:01] would have probably told us but there
[1:21:02] perhaps or something maybe he didn't get
[1:21:04] to but the idea is we want to grow in
[1:21:07] righteousness
[1:21:08] the idea is Jesus said the Holy Ghost
[1:21:11] will lead you into all truth the Holy
[1:21:14] Ghost is going to keep leading us deeper
[1:21:16] into the word the Word of God and we got
[1:21:20] to understand the Word of God now I
[1:21:21] close that chapter with how Jesus
[1:21:23] magnified the law and Jesus Jesus showed
[1:21:27] Jesus enlarged the law like of adultery
[1:21:30] and showed what it really was it was the
[1:21:31] spirit of lust
[1:21:34] and huh me know there's one thing you
[1:21:37] need to fill all the long let me know
[1:21:38] what that is love amen
[1:21:41] God that sister praise the Lord there's
[1:21:44] one thing that fulfills all the law the
[1:21:46] law so fill in one word love and what
[1:21:49] laachraoui under the law of the Spirit
[1:21:51] and the Spirit is love God is love God
[1:21:55] is the Holy Ghost there's one thing we
[1:21:58] need to keep all the law the baptism of
[1:22:00] the ha it just keeps going back to the
[1:22:03] baptism the Holy Ghost church and guess
[1:22:05] what it's gonna keep going back to that
[1:22:06] because that's what's gonna separate the
[1:22:09] wise virgins from the foolish virgins
[1:22:11] those who have the baptism of the Holy
[1:22:13] Ghost the Bible said he shed his love
[1:22:17] upon us in the form of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:22] so God when if God has really loved you
[1:22:25] you know what he's done He shed His
[1:22:27] grace upon you he's poured out his love
[1:22:29] upon you he's poured out his Holy Spirit
[1:22:31] upon you so now you can keep all the law
[1:22:33] because the Holy Spirit will lead you
[1:22:35] away from anything that represents sin
[1:22:38] and unrighteousness now I want you come
[1:22:43] to the piano thank you sir and I want to
[1:22:46] thank now hi today he got the live
[1:22:48] stream going without my help and he was
[1:22:50] doing the piano okay thank you ma'am I
[1:22:52] appreciate that I'm sorry I was in there
[1:22:54] I was so nervous like you know how I get
[1:22:55] before sermons you know I just wanna get
[1:22:56] everything ready but thank you son I
[1:22:58] appreciate that that meant a lot to me
[1:23:00] now are there any questions I know
[1:23:03] brother John likes to ask questions I
[1:23:04] want to maybe do this on Sunday night
[1:23:06] are there any questions I could answer
[1:23:07] now that you might have where I can
[1:23:09] research for Wednesday's anybody have
[1:23:10] any questions or anything you want to
[1:23:12] just think about it for a minute so I
[1:23:16] really like questions I like to go
[1:23:17] search it out myself and find out what
[1:23:19] is that or what is what script what
[1:23:21] scripture says any questions at all yeah
[1:23:26] okay yes is it does that be known
[1:23:35] because he just got space or okay that
[1:23:38] means no man can see the invisible
[1:23:40] spirit he saw God's theophany that's
[1:23:44] what that means
[1:23:45] he saw God's spiritual body that's what
[1:23:47] he saw
[1:23:48] kind of like an angelic body it's the
[1:23:50] same type of body it's at theophany or
[1:23:51] spiritual body good question I like that
[1:23:54] question John right yeah yeah that's a
[1:24:27] good question
[1:24:28] that's a good question I'll look into a
[1:24:30] little bit I just would say first of all
[1:24:32] just make sure we pray before every
[1:24:33] every meal but then also since we're
[1:24:36] aware of that bill John we've got to use
[1:24:38] the net knowledge and if we know
[1:24:40] McDonald's has some unhealthy standards
[1:24:43] for Ray to make getting their chicken
[1:24:44] breasts or whatever more that we should
[1:24:46] probably just stay away from McDonald's
[1:24:48] if we or just get a sound when we go or
[1:24:50] something like that oh yeah we have to
[1:24:51] use whisk that's a great that's a great
[1:24:53] thought if we know there's on humane
[1:24:56] practices like strangling the other we
[1:24:58] need we need to abstain from that that's
[1:25:01] a good thought brother good thought any
[1:25:03] other thoughts about sister Connie yeah
[1:25:07] that's a good one yeah I've never
[1:25:10] studied that yeah I'll look that up and
[1:25:14] I'll look in the message to see her
[1:25:16] brother Brandon said anything about that
[1:25:17] anybody know if he said anything about
[1:25:19] that brother Johnny have you heard
[1:25:20] anything about that okay I'll look up
[1:25:23] like silk cotton what else God yeah I
[1:25:27] know that's in this wool cotton wool I
[1:25:30] would like to see what brother Graham
[1:25:32] said about it first and then if we don't
[1:25:35] have that then we just have to lean upon
[1:25:37] the Holy Spirit you know I would like to
[1:25:41] know that that's a good thought
[1:25:44] I like the questions at the end is good
[1:25:47] to know what people are thinking by
[1:25:50] God's grace all right so maybe next time
[1:25:53] we're willing we'll look at Christian
[1:25:54] liberties there was numerous areas about
[1:25:57] our Christian liberties let me just read
[1:26:00] them real quick so you got them and so
[1:26:01] you'll be thinking about
[1:26:02] this week here are the areas ok foods
[1:26:11] foods are an era of Christian Liberty
[1:26:13] except like we talked about things
[1:26:14] strangled blood observing holy day so
[1:26:17] now that gets down to like Christmas and
[1:26:19] Easter and that would be something good
[1:26:21] to preach on certain holidays is your
[1:26:24] Christian Liberty the next one is wine I
[1:26:30] want to preach on wine because I was
[1:26:32] studying on that and the Bible says in
[1:26:35] Luke 1 that John the Baptist was not to
[1:26:37] drink any wine or strong drink so the
[1:26:41] wine in the Bible days is different than
[1:26:43] wine today and the history I've been
[1:26:45] reading on it says the wine was the the
[1:26:47] the blood of the the blood of the grape
[1:26:50] only it had no additive intoxication
[1:26:54] purposes it was just the juice from the
[1:26:58] fruit okay so we'll look at that Lord
[1:27:01] willing next week by the grace of God
[1:27:03] but member Paul said if drinking wine or
[1:27:06] eating fruit causes one person to
[1:27:08] stumble he said I won't do it as long as
[1:27:09] the world is standing and that's the
[1:27:13] ethic because why because you're living
[1:27:15] for other people you're living for the
[1:27:17] people how many living for other people
[1:27:19] and I was studying too and I found one
[1:27:22] person I think that caused people to be
[1:27:23] lost I think it was a lot I think it was
[1:27:26] lies I said the scripture he caused his
[1:27:27] wife to be lost because the Bible says
[1:27:30] that you can call somebody to sin and
[1:27:31] they'll perish the Bible says think
[1:27:35] about that he chose to move down into
[1:27:37] Sodom and when he's leaving his wife
[1:27:40] turns around and wants to go back what
[1:27:43] if he never would have moved down to
[1:27:44] Sodom but see it looks like he caused
[1:27:48] his wife to be lost can you imagine it
[1:27:51] and brothers we got to be careful where
[1:27:53] were leading our families how many could
[1:27:54] say amen to that
[1:27:54] as a pastor I'd be careful where I'm
[1:27:57] leading this church I want to lead us to
[1:27:59] the Holy Spirit lead us to the Word of
[1:28:02] God that we live the right kind of life
[1:28:04] now I have a whole sermon on that one so
[1:28:06] that's just a little introduction to
[1:28:08] that amen
[1:28:09] what song is that buddy what was it all
[1:28:14] right let's see that to sing that by God
[1:28:15] is good okay
[1:28:16] see the light of the Holy Spirit today
[1:28:17] Oh the Holy Spirit just takes this word
[1:28:20] and shines upon and lights it up so we
[1:28:22] can see how our lives should glorify
[1:28:24] Christ all right it's just about home
