[6:20] right down the middle you know you have
[6:22] people that uh
[6:24] they worship brother Branham they have
[6:26] people that lead brother Brandon I just
[6:28] try to stay right with what brother
[6:29] Randolph said he said every doctrine's
[6:30] got to come right from the Bible praise
[6:32] God
[6:33] and the group that saved and gets the
[6:35] Holy Ghost they come on the other side
[6:37] we saw on Wednesday they come running to
[6:39] brother Adam saying thank you for
[6:40] preaching what Paul preached
[6:42] thank you for going you preach what Paul
[6:44] preached so we're so thankful for the
[6:47] Gospel of Jesus Christ that he revealed
[6:48] to Paul and brother Brown Faithfully
[6:50] preached it by God's grace Romans 2
[6:52] verse 6. I'd like to uh
[6:54] start there and we'll just kind of see
[6:56] how far we can get by the grace of the
[6:58] Lord
[7:02] okay all right all right I got a text
[7:04] from Brother Brian Hawkins I thought he
[7:05] was coming to our church but he's
[7:07] actually free for Indiana
[7:09] he always tells me he says
[7:12] when I drive by your exit he said
[7:14] he said I always think about coming to
[7:16] Akron I don't know if he was visiting us
[7:17] today or not but he's
[7:18] he's preaching in Indiana Romans 2 Verse
[7:20] 6 we'll read
[7:22] 6 to 11 there
[7:26] I'll read six to nine and then we can
[7:29] read 10 and 11 together by God's grace
[7:31] who will render to every man according
[7:33] to his deeds God will pay back every man
[7:36] or woman for what they've done good or
[7:38] bad
[7:39] Hallelujah verse 7 to them by I'm sorry
[7:43] who by patient continuance in well-doing
[7:45] seek for Glory and Honor and immortality
[7:49] eternal life
[7:50] but unto them that are contentious and
[7:52] do not obey the truth but obey in
[7:54] righteousness indignation and wrath
[7:57] tribulation and anguish upon every soul
[7:59] of man that doeth evil of the Jew first
[8:02] and also the Gentile verse 10 and 11.
[8:04] let's read that together one two three
[8:05] but glory honor and peace to every man
[8:09] that worketh good to the Jew first and
[8:13] also to the Gentile for there is no
[8:16] respect of persons with God may God add
[8:19] his Blessing to dream of his word you
[8:20] may be seated here praise God
[8:26] so we'll take this thought here and by
[8:28] God's grace
[8:30] we'll work our way through this book
[8:31] here I know it'll be a blessing to you I
[8:33] really felt the presence of God as I was
[8:35] studying this morning so I was feeling
[8:37] really encouraged I just sometimes it
[8:38] comes as boldness you know sometimes it
[8:40] comes as kind of like crying and weeping
[8:42] and rejoicing but I felt the boldness of
[8:44] the Lord this morning so
[8:45] address the Lord to minister to you now
[8:48] at the end we want to have special
[8:49] prayer you know as I said there's a
[8:50] picture from yesterday
[8:52] oh I'm sorry I got slides today
[8:54] I forgot to tell you I haven't had
[8:56] slides the last few services
[8:58] that's not the picture from yesterday
[9:01] um
[9:02] as you can see I'm wearing the same
[9:03] shirt you know because I didn't sweat
[9:05] much yesterday but uh but we're so
[9:07] thankful for Lydia you know graduate
[9:08] there
[9:09] hard to believe then as we were leaving
[9:11] I just saw that cross up there I thought
[9:12] Lydia you're standing right under the
[9:14] cross I said let's get a picture right
[9:16] there
[9:17] and so we're very thankful you know 17
[9:19] years I'm sorry 18 years of life you
[9:22] know and 12 years of schooling I want to
[9:25] thank my wife you know I couldn't have
[9:27] all this great
[9:28] Education Without hers I want to thank
[9:30] her and you know we'll rejoice when all
[9:32] of your little ones graduate you know
[9:33] we'll Rejoice the same way and have a
[9:35] prayer dedication but it just kind of
[9:37] marks a special spot for my wife and I
[9:39] as our first one is finished and just
[9:43] hard to believe but we're thankful for
[9:44] God's grace
[9:45] so I want to just uh you know as I Was
[9:48] preparing this message I thought about
[9:49] these certain quotes from Brother
[9:50] Branham I'm not sure how familiar you
[9:51] are with them so I'd like to just read
[9:53] these briefly but Ram said did you
[9:55] notice in the Bible Paul didn't have any
[9:57] trouble with the church of Ephesus
[9:59] he said they were Scholars
[10:02] they were men who understood
[10:05] but his trouble wasn't with the Roman
[10:07] Church which is what we're reading now
[10:08] and he exalted them before God and talks
[10:10] of their Faith remember chapter one
[10:12] their faith was heard around the world
[10:15] now Paul's right there now of course you
[10:17] know no church is perfect
[10:19] so we see that the Roman Church did have
[10:22] some issues right they had Jews and
[10:24] Gentiles and they didn't know they had
[10:26] trouble with circumcision as we'll see
[10:28] here in this at the end of this chapter
[10:29] uh you know they didn't they didn't know
[10:32] how to exactly rightly divide the Jew
[10:34] and Gentile uh dispensations right
[10:37] they're coming out of Judaism into the
[10:39] you know that was the Old Testament now
[10:40] they're coming into the new and Paul has
[10:41] to lay it out and that's what we're
[10:43] seeing here in these first three
[10:44] chapters
[10:46] um
[10:46] so you know every Church does have
[10:48] issues every Church does have needs but
[10:50] I like what brother random says he just
[10:52] emphasizes that some churches are more
[10:54] mature than others
[10:55] right but it all works out for God's
[10:57] glory praise God there's going to be a
[10:59] hundred full reward a 64 to 30 fold
[11:01] praise God we want to be the hundredfold
[11:03] by God's grace we want to just invest in
[11:06] everything God has given to us and and
[11:08] we know God will bless all of our
[11:10] investments praise God
[11:12] he says uh but the trouble he had was
[11:14] with with was with Corinth Corinth was
[11:17] the place that he had the trouble for
[11:18] they could not take the word everyone
[11:20] wanted a sensation
[11:22] said why why is it when I come among you
[11:24] one's got a tongue one's got a Solomon
[11:26] one's got this and that some kind of a
[11:28] little foolish sensation he says you're
[11:29] Believers but you're not established
[11:33] and so we gotta uh so we gotta
[11:35] understand from this praise God that uh
[11:37] that everything we have whether it's a
[11:39] dream whether it's a vision whatever it
[11:40] is it's all got to come back to God's
[11:42] word
[11:43] we've got to wait upon promises you know
[11:45] we've got to wait upon thus saith the
[11:47] Lord we've always got to say it might be
[11:49] thou say the Lord lest we know for sure
[11:51] we've got to be very balanced in that
[11:53] we've got to trust in the word of God
[11:55] take everything back to the word
[11:57] now you know Paul wouldn't have preached
[11:58] these things to the Corinthian Church
[11:59] and come back and preach the efficient
[12:02] Ephesian Church something else and the
[12:04] Church of the Thessalonians something
[12:05] else he preached the same gospel
[12:07] everywhere but that Ephesian church he
[12:09] could speak to them some of the great
[12:10] mysteries of God had revealed to him
[12:12] down in Arabia he could preach
[12:14] predestination to them he could preach
[12:15] that to the Corinthians I'm sorry he
[12:17] couldn't preach that to the Corinthian
[12:18] Church why he said they still had to if
[12:20] they didn't have oil running out of
[12:22] their hands or some kind of sensation or
[12:23] something another they wouldn't believe
[12:25] what the word said they had to have a
[12:27] tongue or a Psalm or some kind of little
[12:28] sign or something but Paul couldn't
[12:30] preach the solid doctor to them or we'd
[12:32] say the deeper Doctrine to them right
[12:34] Paul was preaching Doctrine to them
[12:35] right Doctrine about how to handle gifts
[12:37] right
[12:38] and how to even do church discipline
[12:41] right so Paul solid doctor to them but
[12:43] brother means deeper things
[12:44] predestination the mysteries of God
[12:47] hallelujah
[12:48] he says the Corinthians they just could
[12:50] believe anything but they didn't believe
[12:52] the right thing but now look do you
[12:54] believe that Ephesian Church spoke in
[12:55] tongues certainly do you believe they
[12:57] had signs of Wonders yes sir but they
[12:59] knowed how to place them their pastors
[13:01] know how to set them and put the church
[13:02] in order but the Corinthians didn't
[13:05] like remember that question sister Naomi
[13:07] asked you know it's related to family
[13:09] members that go to the the Pentecostal
[13:10] church that you know her family members
[13:13] go to those the pastor will say let's
[13:15] just all speak in unknown tongues
[13:17] and then they say if you don't then
[13:18] you're not spiritual you're not saved or
[13:20] you don't have the Holy Ghost and that's
[13:22] nonsense there's nothing in the
[13:24] scripture about praying in unknown
[13:25] tongues as a Church the opposite's true
[13:28] don't pray in unknown tongues unless you
[13:30] got an interpreter praise God
[13:33] and to see it's uh it's just people that
[13:35] would they lack understanding
[13:38] he said uh he says uh each one had to do
[13:41] this had to do that do this and that
[13:43] they had the gifts Paul said you've got
[13:44] great gifts I'm thankful for them but
[13:46] they didn't know how to use them that's
[13:47] the way it is in the church today and
[13:48] it's went on long enough to the Devils
[13:50] begin to slip in and give you some false
[13:52] signs and wonders could you imagine
[13:54] brother we need the Bible an
[13:56] old-fashioned Saint Paul's Revival and
[13:58] the Bible Holy Ghost the true spirit of
[14:00] God
[14:01] amen church I'm thankful when God does a
[14:04] miracle here when God answers a prayer
[14:06] here I'm so glad that we wait till it's
[14:07] something that's genuine praise God
[14:10] it's not something well I got a little
[14:11] feeling where I got this or I got a
[14:13] sensation I'm thankful that we wait till
[14:15] we know it's God praise God
[14:17] I'm thankful that imagine I'm thankful
[14:19] that no one's had to get up here and
[14:20] apologize I'm sorry I said thus said the
[14:21] Lord when it wasn't
[14:23] I'm glad I'm glad that this the devil's
[14:26] not deceived any of us where we've ever
[14:28] said oh this is God they'll say the Lord
[14:30] and we're in other words the devil
[14:32] hasn't deceited us where we're trying to
[14:33] be something that we're not amen thank
[14:36] God that we can just be what God made us
[14:37] to be hallelujah thank God we just wait
[14:40] till God vindicates it praise God
[14:42] amen it's a blessing now here a month
[14:45] later brother man I said now in the book
[14:46] of Corinthians the 10th chapter this
[14:48] book is a book of correction we should
[14:51] take the book of Corinthians it's only
[14:53] church in all the New Testament
[14:54] seemingly that the leaders had such
[14:56] trouble with but Corinthians was always
[14:58] in trouble
[15:01] Paul when he come among them one had a
[15:03] tongue one had a song one had a feeling
[15:04] and a sensation and he was always having
[15:06] trouble with these Corinthians keeping
[15:07] them straight
[15:09] if we notice he couldn't teach the
[15:11] Corinthians deep things they were just a
[15:13] baby fashioned a baby Church I don't
[15:16] want to be a baby church I want to be a
[15:18] mature Church
[15:20] they couldn't go to them great deep
[15:22] messages that he preached to the
[15:23] Ephesians and to the Romans ah look
[15:26] Jersey when we preach this Roman series
[15:28] we're in the deeper things of God
[15:30] we're enjoying the richness of God's
[15:32] depths of his mercy and his mind amen
[15:35] we're in the mind of Christ Hallelujah
[15:39] there's a place for uh signs wonders and
[15:41] miracles there's definitely a place for
[15:43] that praise God but the Corinthians were
[15:45] going too far on that they thought
[15:46] everything was a signed Wonder a miracle
[15:49] right like I just talked to your brother
[15:51] recently I'm just going to tell this
[15:52] story
[15:53] and he's recognizing problems in his
[15:55] home church but he even recognized I was
[15:58] part of the problem
[15:59] and here's his testimony I'm just going
[16:01] to share it I think it'd be a help to
[16:02] you there was a issue in their church
[16:04] about whether to play the new songs like
[16:07] Chris Tomlin and or a Hillsong song or
[16:10] something like that and he was so worked
[16:12] up about it he was praying and he said
[16:13] he said Lord he said if it's your will
[16:16] that we don't sing Chris Tomlin songs he
[16:18] I don't know why he called out Chris
[16:19] Tomlin I don't know why but I guess
[16:21] there was some debate in their church we
[16:22] should we play Chris Tomlin or not
[16:25] he said Lord if it's your will that we
[16:27] we shouldn't do Chris tomlin's songs he
[16:29] said then let the piano be broken
[16:32] and it did
[16:34] and he and so he reported to the pastor
[16:36] and so for a while that church didn't
[16:38] play Chris Thomas songs well later he
[16:40] learned it's not about the individual
[16:41] person you just have to balance you have
[16:44] to rightly divide every song If the
[16:46] lyrics are of God then you can sing it
[16:47] you take out any rock and roll and
[16:50] that's how we've always taught it here
[16:51] by God's grace
[16:53] and he says now I realized I was wrong I
[16:55] was just looking for a sensation and now
[16:57] he sings Chris Tomlin songs that's his
[16:59] testimony
[17:01] so think about that so see we've got to
[17:03] make sure
[17:04] now it's a good thing he didn't run up
[17:06] and say I've got thus saith the Lord
[17:07] that's a good thing because then he
[17:09] would have been a false prophet
[17:11] right
[17:12] so just you know see we got even
[17:13] something like that
[17:15] when we put God to the test we got to be
[17:17] really careful
[17:19] because he's apparently and he's humble
[17:21] he just said I put God to the test I
[17:23] thought God gave the answer but later I
[17:25] found out I was wrong I was just going
[17:26] off a sensation
[17:29] and the church said
[17:30] Hallelujah let's grow in maturity by
[17:33] God's grace amen hallelujah
[17:37] he said now they depended on little
[17:39] Sensations we said well just well praise
[17:41] the Lord I had a revelation come to me I
[17:43] just saw him out of Prophecy Paul said
[17:45] all these things will fail every one of
[17:46] them they just not to be trusted too
[17:48] much in other words you got to be
[17:49] careful each one's got to be tested by
[17:50] the word
[17:52] but what he's trying to get the church
[17:54] was the anchor where we have an anchor
[17:57] in Christ where we don't trust the bone
[17:59] Sensations we don't trust the bond we
[18:01] say Revelations outside the word right
[18:02] we don't trust these things we only
[18:04] trust Christ it's by faith that we move
[18:06] out there praise God now what is Faith
[18:09] Church Brothers says faith is a
[18:10] revelation so see even this we we do we
[18:13] do trust Bible revelations we don't
[18:15] trust fleshly Revelations because those
[18:17] are false Revelations everybody
[18:19] understand this is why every quote's got
[18:21] to be rightly divided too
[18:23] because faith is a revelation he's
[18:26] saying it's not don't trust Revelation
[18:27] but then he says trust Faith well faith
[18:29] is a revelation
[18:31] I see we're teaching some deep things
[18:32] today praise God Amen Hallelujah now
[18:35] let's get in the Book of Romans here now
[18:37] remember we are in the first section
[18:38] we're we read we preach the introduction
[18:40] and now we're on the whole world is
[18:42] guilty before God
[18:44] we'll get to part two maybe uh Wednesday
[18:46] we'll see by God's grace
[18:48] and then uh the beautiful just the
[18:50] sections here are just beautiful the way
[18:52] Paul or Schofield outlines Paul's uh
[18:55] letter here remember said this is that
[18:57] deep letter how many you enjoy the Deep
[18:58] things of God oh I do praise God now I
[19:01] want to I you know I just had this
[19:02] thought yes or this morning I thought I
[19:05] said I want to look up every time
[19:06] brother Branham said Romans Chapter 2
[19:08] which verses did he use isn't that a
[19:09] good good thought
[19:11] and I said and I already preached Romans
[19:13] 1 I said let me go back and let me find
[19:14] every time brother random use Romans 1
[19:16] well guess what he used them three times
[19:18] three times
[19:20] so here's the first one
[19:22] brother random cites Romans 2 29. now
[19:25] he's preaching the the church ages the
[19:27] Philadelphia Church age
[19:29] now I'm going to skip down here right to
[19:31] now now the first church age was taught
[19:33] by who Paul now let's go to Romans 2 29
[19:36] and see what a Jew is so that you'll be
[19:38] sure to know it isn't my own thought of
[19:40] it I like that see brother Adam says I
[19:41] want you to know it's not my thought and
[19:43] when it's when it's not my thought I'll
[19:45] point you to the Bible praise God the
[19:48] Bible is God's thoughts hallelujah amen
[19:50] thank God he says Romans the second
[19:53] chapter
[19:55] he says all right here we are but he's a
[19:57] Jew which is one inwardly
[19:59] and circumcision is of the heart in the
[20:01] spirit and not in the letter whose
[20:04] praise is not a man but of God
[20:08] in other words see Church men are not
[20:10] going to praise the people who have
[20:12] God's spiritual circumcision
[20:14] in other words if you're a real believer
[20:15] men are not going to praise you and Pat
[20:17] you on the back unless there's the devil
[20:19] trying to get him to do it right right
[20:21] but God will honor you praise God God
[20:25] will hear your prayers amen God will
[20:27] have respect unto your testimony praise
[20:29] God
[20:30] so don't look for praise for men don't
[20:32] look for praise from women don't look
[20:34] praise from this world but look for the
[20:37] praise that comes forth from God
[20:38] hallelujah
[20:40] where God will hear your prayer God will
[20:42] give you a testimony that just you and
[20:44] maybe one other person know about praise
[20:46] God
[20:47] a secret testimony pray something like
[20:49] that you know something that's not
[20:50] shared so much publicly but something
[20:52] that's a a secret where God uh God
[20:54] honors you like Jesus said when you pray
[20:56] and give and fashion secret God rewards
[20:59] you openly praise God and maybe just
[21:01] between one or two people praise God
[21:03] but God is going to pay you back
[21:05] he will render to every man and woman
[21:08] based upon the works that you did the
[21:10] faith that you expressed oh my this
[21:13] beautiful praise God that's what faith
[21:14] is Faith that's what works are works is
[21:17] your faith expressed praise God Save By
[21:19] Faith Save By Grace and then be as your
[21:22] appreciation to God for Grace you work
[21:24] for the kingdom of God
[21:26] then he says he says what does it do a
[21:29] spirit Holy Ghost filled Christian
[21:31] praise God
[21:32] I know that you're down here after that
[21:34] age of sanctification that say you that
[21:36] they've got the Holy Ghost but he said
[21:38] it I never
[21:40] they said they had the Holy Ghost
[21:41] without science following but he said
[21:43] they're liar these signs shall follow
[21:44] them that believe can't make him lie oh
[21:46] brother that binds you around and around
[21:48] oh my praise God see that's why Church
[21:51] says signs and wonders at times that
[21:52] follow our lives
[21:54] hallelujah it's God vindicating that
[21:56] you're a real child of God hallelujah
[21:59] and church we can't work them up we
[22:01] can't train them up all we can do is be
[22:02] consecrated and then God will do signs
[22:05] and wonders at the appointed time and
[22:06] place Hallelujah Abram had to wait 25
[22:09] years until his body changed Hallelujah
[22:12] but God Vindicated him and Time After
[22:14] Time God would meet with him talk with
[22:16] him encourage him and say I will bring
[22:18] it to pass I'm giving you more details
[22:20] about the promise God will give you more
[22:22] details about the promises for your life
[22:24] Hallelujah
[22:26] amen praise God just stay faithful to
[22:28] God hallelujah have patience and
[22:31] well-doing before God hallelujah
[22:33] now here's the second time brother man
[22:35] uses Romans 2. that was the first time
[22:37] Romans 2 29.
[22:39] now he's going to reuse Romans uh see me
[22:42] Romans 2 3. we'll get to that in just a
[22:44] moment now in the church age book
[22:46] brother man I'm talking about the
[22:48] Sevenfold Glory of Jesus Christ in
[22:50] Revelation chapter one
[22:52] I preached on this years ago I think it
[22:53] was 2017 I preached on this
[22:56] I remember because Kevin are not arnott
[22:58] was still here and he was I really
[22:59] enjoyed that message brother
[23:00] some for some reason I just have these
[23:02] strange memories
[23:03] the sixth attribute of Jesus Christ is
[23:06] that a two-edged sword comes out of this
[23:08] mouth
[23:09] and out of his mouth went to Edge I want
[23:11] a sharp two-edged sword and this reminds
[23:13] us that Hebrews 4 12 for the word of God
[23:15] is quick and powerful and sharper than
[23:18] any two-edged sword piercing even the
[23:20] dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit and
[23:22] of the joints of marrow and is a
[23:24] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[23:26] the heart so here we see the Sevenfold
[23:28] Glory of Jesus and then brother Adam
[23:31] goes from that scripture to this
[23:32] scripture John 1 48 Nathanael saith unto
[23:36] him whence knoweth thou meme Jesus
[23:39] answered and said to him before that
[23:40] Philip called thee when I was under the
[23:42] Fig Tree I saw thee so when Jesus
[23:45] discerned your life and does something
[23:47] Supernatural it lets you know that the
[23:50] word of God is watching you praise God
[23:52] the word of God is is telling you things
[23:55] that only you and God know that's a sign
[23:58] that Jesus Christ is speaking to you
[24:00] it's a sign that you're in the presence
[24:02] of Jesus Hallelujah
[24:04] Hallelujah like we've had it over the
[24:06] weeks I know Lena's giving me some good
[24:07] testimonies where in other ones where
[24:09] I've just preached and it's exactly what
[24:11] you needed to hear it's exactly what you
[24:13] are going through in your life and
[24:14] church only Jesus is the author of that
[24:17] we just got to get into the channel or
[24:19] the the stream of his of his spirit and
[24:22] then when we're in that channel then God
[24:23] will discern our hearts amen it'll it
[24:26] just flows praise God as we get into the
[24:28] channel of the Holy Spirit praise God as
[24:31] we repent of our sins believe God walk
[24:33] in the spirit God's spirit will lead us
[24:35] hallelujah
[24:37] amen he said there it is when Jesus
[24:39] comes that word will come against all
[24:41] nations and all men
[24:43] and none will be able to stand against
[24:44] it it will reveal what was in every
[24:47] heart as he did with Nathanael
[24:49] think of that think of that Jesus is
[24:51] going to do a spiritual open-heart
[24:53] surgery brother Austin
[24:55] brother bang one day Jesus is going to
[24:57] open every spiritual heart and show
[24:59] what's inside of that heart
[25:01] we can't see it all the time we get
[25:03] Clues by people's words and actions but
[25:06] Jesus is going to surgically spiritually
[25:08] open every heart and pull out this this
[25:11] may God find good things in our hearts
[25:13] amen when God does the surgery on you
[25:16] and I may he bring out peace and joy and
[25:18] victory and repentance and humility
[25:20] praise God
[25:21] may you find good things sword in our
[25:24] hearts praise God Amen
[25:26] the word of God will show who did the
[25:29] will of God and who didn't
[25:31] it will make known the secret works of
[25:32] every man and why did them it will
[25:34] divide asunder oh my
[25:38] God this oh you know this let's say this
[25:40] celebrity gave a million dollars to
[25:41] Goodwill or not good will but the Red
[25:44] Cross or whatever well the the Jesus
[25:46] will show why he gave that million
[25:49] dollars
[25:50] was it just to ease his conscience
[25:52] because he already spent maybe 10
[25:53] million on himself and the lust of his
[25:55] flesh and the toys that he bought you
[25:56] know the million dollar cars and
[25:58] everything
[25:59] we'll know why people did what they did
[26:01] we'll know why Russia invaded Ukraine
[26:04] right well no why we'll know about Joe
[26:07] Biden and Donald Trump and we'll know
[26:09] why Barack Obama did all these things
[26:11] we'll know why
[26:13] Hallelujah because the word will divide
[26:16] asunder everything that's in someone's
[26:18] heart
[26:20] may it find good things in our hearts
[26:22] praise God
[26:23] and in the same section brother Brown
[26:25] uses he goes to Romans 2 verse 3 which
[26:28] we already preached out on Wednesday
[26:31] and what thinketh thou oh man that
[26:33] judges them which do such things and do
[26:35] us the same that thou shalt escape the
[26:38] Judgment of God
[26:40] then it goes on to say this is a Romans
[26:42] 2 how God is going to judge men here it
[26:45] is in verses 5 to 17. now we read 6
[26:47] through 11.
[26:49] but we are going to read today how Jesus
[26:52] Will judge all men
[26:54] and brother Ram wrote about this in the
[26:56] church age book
[26:59] he says the the hard impeditent heart
[27:02] will be judged The Works will be judged
[27:05] the motives will be judged there won't
[27:07] be any respect before God but all will
[27:10] be judged by that word no one escaping
[27:12] it those who hurt and wouldn't listen
[27:15] will be judged by what they heard those
[27:17] that rested and saying that they
[27:19] believed it but didn't live it will be
[27:21] judged now think about that all the
[27:23] people that heard the message but didn't
[27:24] live it will be judged
[27:26] every secret will come out in the open
[27:28] and be shouted from the housetops oh man
[27:31] we get all of our secrets under the
[27:33] blood
[27:34] Hallelujah get everything under the
[27:36] blood Hallelujah now look oh we will
[27:39] really understand history then
[27:43] now we church if anybody has a good
[27:46] start in world history it's the bride
[27:49] you know why because we got Daniel's
[27:50] revelation of that image
[27:52] we see the Demonic Powers right
[27:55] through Babylon meets the Persians the
[27:57] grecians and now it's in Babylon
[28:00] so we have a we have like a head start
[28:02] on world history
[28:04] and we know why each leader did all
[28:06] these things Alexander the Great it was
[28:08] saved and behind that
[28:10] Dima demons behind that now we know the
[28:12] leaders today America leaders are led by
[28:15] Satan Satan is in charge of every nation
[28:17] right
[28:19] but at the day of Judgment at the white
[28:21] Throne judgment we're going to get a
[28:23] complete history lesson from Jesus amen
[28:26] he's going to expose every heart why
[28:28] people did everything they did he said
[28:31] there won't be a mystery left from all
[28:34] the ages
[28:35] we'll know about the Crusades we'll know
[28:38] about September 11th right we'll know
[28:39] about JFK's assassination we'll know
[28:42] about all these Mysteries we'll know
[28:44] about everything 9 11. we'll know all
[28:46] about it because every man's motive will
[28:48] be exposed before everybody
[28:51] that's what the word does hallelujah
[28:55] now remember this I just thought I'd go
[28:56] over this because it tied in very neatly
[28:57] there
[28:58] there are Sevenfold Glory of Jesus
[29:00] Christ now brother man gets this from uh
[29:03] Clarence Larkin if you ever read
[29:04] Larkin's book
[29:06] Larkin taught the Sevenfold glory and
[29:08] then brother M kind of uh uses maybe his
[29:10] own scriptures but he gets this idea
[29:12] from Larkin which he said I'm using 20
[29:14] times he said in the church ages I use
[29:16] historians notes 20 times so it's not
[29:18] like he didn't tell us he told us
[29:21] so Jesus first has a head and hairs
[29:23] white like wool and brother Adam tells
[29:26] us that this means the judge is crowned
[29:28] with wisdom
[29:30] you're not going to get we're not going
[29:32] to get anything by Jesus on the day of
[29:33] judgment
[29:35] not gonna be like these slick lawyers
[29:36] that can twist the truth and try to hide
[29:38] things no all of the evidence will be
[29:40] laid out before this wise judge
[29:43] so so here's the picture you got a man I
[29:47] don't know reaping I'm sorry repenting
[29:48] or dying I'm not even sure here
[29:50] because this is Revelation chapter 11.
[29:53] you have the Lord Jesus Christ and the
[29:55] Bible said John was in the spirit on the
[29:57] Lord's Day and program says the Lord's
[30:00] day is based at Armageddon when the so
[30:03] the Lord's day starts at Armageddon when
[30:06] man is no longer in charge of the Earth
[30:07] but now Jesus comes to Reign praise God
[30:10] the days of men are over the days of
[30:13] Russia and China and the U.S ruling all
[30:16] those days are over Jesus has returned
[30:18] Hallelujah
[30:20] and this is what he comes back like he
[30:22] comes back like this now of course not
[30:25] exact like that but with all these
[30:27] descriptions he comes back with these
[30:29] Sevenfold descriptions the first thing
[30:31] they mention is his wisdom isn't that
[30:33] interesting the first gift is wisdom
[30:36] isn't that interesting
[30:38] the same holy spirit that told the
[30:40] Corinthians wisdom is the first gift and
[30:42] you gotta have wisdom to recognize the
[30:43] mother Harlot the first thing the Holy
[30:45] Spirit describes about Jesus is his hair
[30:49] white hair
[30:51] Hallelujah
[30:52] is it interesting when a woman comes in
[30:54] the message the first thing she needs is
[30:56] long uncut hair right she's got a yeah
[30:58] learn to obey the word of God right
[31:00] Hallelujah man's got to cut his hair if
[31:01] he's got long hair like some guys that
[31:03] had mullets in college I don't know
[31:06] some guys had him I don't
[31:08] know the second Glory
[31:11] flame of fire and brothers says these
[31:13] are Angry Eyes of judgment without Mercy
[31:17] so there's no more Mercy a person will
[31:19] just be judged by exactly what was in
[31:21] their heart
[31:22] and think about a church it's going to
[31:24] be very easy for Jesus to judge the Lord
[31:26] showed I believe the Lord revealed to me
[31:28] while I Was preparing there's only two
[31:29] kinds of Hearts either have a heart of
[31:31] Flesh or a Heart of Stone
[31:33] it's very easy for Jesus to judge
[31:35] the word will show did you have did you
[31:38] and I have a soft heart of Flesh that
[31:40] could be uh that could be touched and
[31:42] written upon by the word of God in other
[31:44] words can God teach you to live a more
[31:46] holy life or not oh come on somebody
[31:50] either either the spirit of God can
[31:52] write on it or not
[31:54] right it's got to be a fleshly heart
[31:56] it's got to be a tender heart a heart
[31:58] that loves the word a heart that loves
[32:00] to worship that's the kind of heart
[32:02] that's a saved heart praise God it's
[32:04] gonna be very easy for Jesus show here's
[32:06] here's brother amen's heart of Flesh
[32:09] your sister who is heart of Flesh
[32:12] and here's a sinner's Heart of Stone
[32:14] to be very easy
[32:16] to show the difference
[32:18] and his eyes are eyes of fire our God is
[32:21] a consuming fire
[32:24] right
[32:25] so his eyes are like fire just it
[32:27] reveals it burns it burns out any
[32:30] questions right where's that and it
[32:32] clearly sees it's either flesh or stone
[32:37] so now he's got hair like wool eyes like
[32:40] fire
[32:41] the third Glory he has feet like
[32:43] undefined brass as if they were burned
[32:45] in a furnace and this represents
[32:47] untempered judgment
[32:50] right it's pure judgment it's true
[32:53] judgment it's not different for anybody
[32:55] it's it's the exact same judgment for
[32:58] everybody
[32:59] Hallelujah that's what brother says he
[33:01] says but this brass that describes his
[33:03] feet is more remarkable yet in that it
[33:05] has stood the test of the fiery furnace
[33:08] Hallelujah
[33:10] so that's what we see brass signifies
[33:12] Divine judgment Jesus suffered God's
[33:15] Wrath for us praise God
[33:18] he said it's a judgment that God has
[33:20] decreed and brought to pass
[33:22] Hallelujah so this represents Jesus walk
[33:25] through God's Divine judgment and now he
[33:28] can judge exactly right he'll judge
[33:30] without partiality praise God
[33:32] he won't have any favorites
[33:34] so now as we see his feet
[33:37] are is pure judgment crushing all
[33:40] enemies
[33:42] ah this is our Lord amen this is now
[33:45] when he was on Earth he was gentle Jesus
[33:47] at times right but then he would also
[33:49] get the uh the cord and whip out the
[33:51] money exchangers as well praise God
[33:53] Hallelujah but here he comes back and
[33:57] it's all judgment but thank God church
[33:58] when he comes back we won't be on the
[34:00] earth we'll be in the air behind him
[34:02] praise God oh thank God Amen we'll just
[34:05] be backing him up praise God that's all
[34:07] I'm doing today brother amen we're just
[34:09] backing up Jesus today praise God
[34:11] we're just backing up the message we're
[34:13] backing up the truth saying this is amen
[34:15] well God gave birth around this this is
[34:17] exactly right praise God we believe
[34:18] everything the Bible says we're backing
[34:20] up Jesus today praise God
[34:23] it ain't going to change much just our
[34:24] location is going to change sister sir
[34:26] just our location right now we're
[34:28] backing him up and we'll back him up at
[34:30] Armageddon as well praise God amen
[34:33] hallelujah thank God
[34:35] the fourth glory is his voice as the
[34:37] sound of many Waters
[34:40] the church your voice is in there do you
[34:42] know that
[34:43] program said that voice is all the
[34:45] voices of the Believers down Through the
[34:47] Ages it will bring condemnation the
[34:49] Bible said the Saints shall judge the
[34:51] Earth
[34:53] so when Jesus speaks there'll be times
[34:55] in the in the Judgment where Jesus
[34:57] speaks and our voices will join him in
[35:00] the judgment
[35:02] and and groups of people will be judged
[35:04] by the Christians who obey the word of
[35:06] God aren't you glad that you get to
[35:08] speak with Jesus
[35:09] his voice is as a sound of many Waters
[35:12] and Waters are peoples and multitudes
[35:15] praise God oh my God hallelujah all the
[35:18] generations will speak with Jesus
[35:21] they'll say exactly what he said because
[35:23] that's what we're doing right now amen
[35:24] we're just saying what Jesus says amen
[35:27] I'm just saying what the Bible says
[35:29] hallelujah
[35:32] thank God
[35:34] so now we got four parts hair eyes voice
[35:37] feet the fifth glory is Seven Stars in
[35:40] his hand brother and I said these are
[35:42] the messengers in his care
[35:45] and we've received the message of this
[35:46] hour Hallelujah so I don't have to spend
[35:48] much time on that but in other words
[35:50] brother Branham was in God's Loving Care
[35:53] so is Martin Luther
[35:55] John Wesley Paul iranius Martin Columba
[35:58] they were all in God's Tenors care
[36:00] Church how many can see God's Tender
[36:02] Care in your life as well
[36:05] Hallelujah
[36:07] clearly we can see god holds his
[36:09] Messengers in his care and no doubt the
[36:11] Bible said cast your care on him because
[36:13] he cares for you as well
[36:16] amen praise God but he's got Special
[36:18] Care
[36:19] for his seven Messengers praise God
[36:21] hallelujah
[36:24] just like that one time I was looking at
[36:25] you know I was making this video about
[36:27] Jim Jones again and brother Brandon Jim
[36:28] Jones LED 900 people to their desk
[36:30] brother Branham when he was younger
[36:32] tried to kill four or five boys with a
[36:35] shotgun and God wouldn't let the gun go
[36:36] off
[36:37] talk about predestination
[36:40] and then he tried to commit suicide and
[36:42] God spared him from that talk about
[36:43] Grace with Austin right talk about Grace
[36:46] amen
[36:47] Hallelujah that's God that's God's
[36:50] foreknowledge he saw brother M wanted to
[36:52] live right and he wouldn't want to be a
[36:53] murderer and he wouldn't want to commit
[36:55] suicide if his heart was in the right
[36:56] condition
[36:57] and because God had borne out he could
[37:00] predestinate God's Deliverance amen
[37:02] hallelujah he could show he cared for a
[37:04] servant and he wouldn't let his servant
[37:06] commit murder he cared for her son he
[37:08] wouldn't let his son commit suicide
[37:10] praise God that's because he cares so
[37:12] much and if he cared for Paul he cared
[37:14] for brother for him he cares for you and
[37:15] I too praise God oh my thank God Amen
[37:19] Hallelujah
[37:22] brother says now next is a sharp
[37:24] two-edged sword out of his mouth this is
[37:26] the word that will judge all this is
[37:28] what we read earlier
[37:31] so a word comes out and judges everybody
[37:33] the same
[37:35] a two-edged sword
[37:37] Hallelujah
[37:39] and last but not least the seven full
[37:41] Glory of Christ
[37:43] his countenance his face is as the son
[37:46] and this represents the power right like
[37:48] this morning I was praying at the
[37:50] Sunrise it was so bright out there on my
[37:52] deck it was so bright I had to position
[37:54] I had to sit where the sun was hiding
[37:56] behind the wooden post there on the
[37:57] bottom part of my deck there because it
[37:58] was so bright I couldn't even like focus
[38:00] it was so bright Lord have mercy
[38:03] the power of His countenance amen the
[38:06] power it's like the sun
[38:08] the power of his face now he's got eyes
[38:09] of fire in there too he's got white hair
[38:11] and the power of His countenance brother
[38:13] says this represents the power of his
[38:16] righteousness
[38:18] in other words when the Sun Shines on
[38:19] you you just gotta you just gotta absorb
[38:21] it and you gotta look away and so it is
[38:24] on the day of judgment when Jesus says
[38:26] Holiness strikes these Sinners they're
[38:28] going to say yes I do that yes I commit
[38:29] adultery yes I committed fornication yes
[38:32] yes I was a whoremonger yes I was yes I
[38:35] was a murderer all these things they
[38:36] will not be able to escape it it's too
[38:38] powerful they'll have to tell the truth
[38:40] that's the power of His countenance
[38:42] Hallelujah
[38:43] it shines it's righteousness shines like
[38:47] the sun praise God
[38:49] amen and look they have to look away
[38:50] from the Holiness and and recognize that
[38:54] they can't lie in the presence of Jesus
[38:55] Christ
[38:56] amen
[38:58] in church that's the Sevenfold Glory of
[39:00] his person how many appreciate the Lord
[39:02] that's a good review I haven't preached
[39:03] out in about six years so
[39:05] it feels good to preach it again amen
[39:07] hope that's a blessing by God's grace
[39:09] but with the with the sword
[39:13] the sword yeah that's where brother and
[39:16] places Romans chapter 2.
[39:19] where Paul shows he's going to judge
[39:21] everybody the same way
[39:24] Hallelujah
[39:26] now those are two quotes on Romans 2 and
[39:28] the whole message I could find I
[39:30] searched the three or four five
[39:31] different times different phrases I
[39:33] could find
[39:34] brother Raymond has one quote from
[39:36] Romans chapter one so this is kind of
[39:37] back going back to part one and part two
[39:41] Brothers preaching out of Revelation 3
[39:43] the celebrity in church H or teaching in
[39:45] the book he said now God says they are
[39:47] naked is buying as well I'm talking
[39:48] about lukewarm church members not us
[39:51] we're not naked we're covered
[39:53] spiritually and naturally amen and we're
[39:55] not blind we can see we can see the
[39:57] Beast and we can see the bride of Christ
[39:59] how many thank God for that you are
[40:02] clothed and you have sight ah thank God
[40:04] Amen but George like we saw yesterday we
[40:06] got family members that are blind
[40:08] and naked sometimes naturally
[40:11] right blind and naked and don't even
[40:13] know it and yet we told them
[40:16] yet I put videos on the YouTube for them
[40:18] and Facebook and everything like that
[40:19] gave them my books
[40:21] and they know it right but then they
[40:23] don't know it because they're running
[40:24] from the truth in other words they won't
[40:26] obey it is what it means praise God
[40:28] he says brother said I cannot imagine
[40:30] anything as tragic as a man who's blind
[40:33] and naked and does not know it there's
[40:34] only one answer he's out of his mind
[40:36] right and romance said we're gonna he
[40:37] said thus saith the Lord we're coming to
[40:38] an insane age
[40:42] he is already deep and Oblivion his
[40:44] faculties are gone spiritual Amnesia
[40:46] said in what else can it mean can it
[40:48] mean that the Holy Spirit has taken his
[40:49] leave out of the last day Church could
[40:51] it mean that men have put God out of
[40:53] their minds to an extent that is
[40:54] happening even as stated in Romans 1 28
[40:57] remember we preach on this
[40:58] and even as they did not like to retain
[41:00] God and their knowledge God gave them
[41:03] over to reprobate mind to do those
[41:05] things which are not convenient so
[41:06] brother man goes back to Romans 1 to
[41:09] show the state of the church in the end
[41:12] time in laodicea
[41:14] hallelujah what a blessing what an
[41:16] encouragement
[41:17] church we feel sad we mourn over people
[41:20] like this that have reprobate mind but
[41:23] you've got a sound mind
[41:25] let me tell you some good news God gives
[41:27] you the spirit of love power and a sound
[41:30] mind praise God you are not of this
[41:32] lukewarm group you're of the hot group
[41:34] praise God Amen you love Jesus why
[41:37] because you love to retain the word of
[41:40] God in your mind Hallelujah
[41:42] like I told Haven I said Haven you keep
[41:44] where's Haven I said you keep memorizing
[41:46] she was asking me daddy should I keep
[41:47] speaking the word before Bible or prayer
[41:49] time and bedtime I said absolutely
[41:51] that'll be the greatest blessing you can
[41:53] have is to quote God's word before you
[41:56] go to sleep praise God
[41:58] Hallelujah
[42:00] I said yeah honey that's well I'll
[42:02] produce some of the greatest blessings
[42:03] in your life
[42:04] quote the word of God memorize the word
[42:06] of God speak the word of God Amen
[42:09] hallelujah praise God
[42:12] so this scripture Romans 1 28 speaks of
[42:14] laodicea as well it spoke of the sinners
[42:16] in the Ephesian Church age right and
[42:18] when Paul wrote it and today it speaks
[42:21] of laodicean church members that are
[42:24] lukewarm
[42:25] that's right
[42:27] now brother man goes on to say this
[42:28] right after Romans 1 28 it surely
[42:31] appears that something like that has
[42:32] happened here's a people who say there
[42:34] of God and know God and have his Holy
[42:37] Spirit and yet they're naked and blind
[42:38] and don't know it like one of our family
[42:40] members yesterday they we went to their
[42:41] church and they talked about how they're
[42:43] filled with the holy spirit yet they let
[42:45] their women cut their hair wear pants
[42:46] and wear short shorts and wear sexy
[42:48] clothes they say they got they're filled
[42:51] with the spirit in other words we're
[42:53] saying we're filled with the Holy Spirit
[42:54] and they're saying they're filled with
[42:55] the Holy Spirit well somebody's right
[42:57] and somebody's wrong and the only way
[42:59] that you know is by the sharp sword of
[43:02] Jesus's mouth Hallelujah that's the only
[43:04] way you know is the word of God
[43:07] what does the word tell us the word
[43:08] tells us how to dress the world the word
[43:10] tells us how to have the Holy Spirit
[43:12] praise God
[43:13] and what a Holy Spirit-filled life will
[43:15] look like amen
[43:19] he says they are already deceived they
[43:21] have the wrong Spirit the elect cannot
[43:23] be deceived but is evident that these
[43:25] others are these are they who have
[43:28] become blind because they refuse the
[43:29] word of God these are they who have
[43:31] stripped themselves naked by leaving
[43:33] God's care and protection and sought to
[43:35] build their own way of Salvation their
[43:37] own Tower of Babel by organization
[43:40] right one Church gathering with other
[43:43] churches or we've got support of all the
[43:45] churches
[43:46] that's the biggest sign that you're
[43:47] under uh The Jezebel smear that I know
[43:49] of
[43:50] that you want to gather with Catholics
[43:52] and and you want to gather with
[43:53] lutherans and methodists and Baptists
[43:55] that you that your your strength is in
[43:57] communion with them our strength is in
[43:59] communion with Christ Hallelujah not a
[44:02] denomination because the denominations
[44:03] have kicked him out of the church but we
[44:06] welcome him this morning praise God we
[44:07] sang Praises this morning we said
[44:10] prayers this morning we welcome Jesus
[44:12] amen
[44:13] he's not knocking trying to get in Jesus
[44:17] is in Hallelujah
[44:19] amen and the church said amen he's not
[44:21] trying to get in our church he is in
[44:23] this church Hallelujah
[44:24] he's the foundation of the church and
[44:26] one day for the amen at the Rapture
[44:28] he'll be the Capstone of this church
[44:30] amen glory amen thank God
[44:35] Hallelujah
[44:38] now notice now I'm going to get more to
[44:40] verse by verse preaching here by God's
[44:42] grace
[44:43] in these first two chapters Paul is
[44:46] speaking to three groups
[44:48] the first group are Gentile pagans right
[44:51] these are the ones that don't like to
[44:52] retain God in their minds these are the
[44:55] homosexuals the murderers like Jim Jones
[44:58] this the first group is the Gentile
[45:01] pagans
[45:02] now Romans 2 1-16 is the second group
[45:05] Gentile moralists
[45:08] okay
[45:10] as we'll get to here in a little bit
[45:12] because later on Paul's going to say any
[45:15] Gentile that doesn't know the Jewish law
[45:18] or the Torah still has the law of God
[45:21] written in their hearts
[45:23] everybody with me
[45:25] so no doubt there were Gentile Nations
[45:27] they didn't have the Torah they didn't
[45:29] have Genesis exes Leviticus numbers and
[45:31] Deuteronomy they didn't have those but
[45:34] Paul said it doesn't matter they had
[45:36] God's word written their heart
[45:38] praise God
[45:40] Hallelujah now just so you know Paul
[45:43] says there is an advantage to having the
[45:44] Torah
[45:46] okay so the Jews had an advantage but
[45:48] most of them didn't take advantage of
[45:50] that advantage
[45:52] they didn't capitalize on that Advantage
[45:53] Church let's enjoy all the advantages we
[45:55] have
[45:57] what advantages do we got well we got no
[45:58] physical persecution right now
[46:00] we got Bibles on our phones we got
[46:03] paperback Bibles we've got all the
[46:05] sermons of brother random that we should
[46:06] listen to
[46:07] praise God we have all these advantages
[46:09] let's make the most of them praise God
[46:12] Hallelujah
[46:14] but Paul said even these Gentiles
[46:16] without the law
[46:18] they still had God's law written in
[46:21] their hearts and their minds in other
[46:23] words they knew right from wrong
[46:25] and the third group at the end of this
[46:28] chapter is the Jews that were legalistic
[46:31] and had the law of God
[46:33] and Paul says all these groups are
[46:36] condemned
[46:38] by their sin
[46:40] right
[46:41] unless they have what what's that f word
[46:43] they got to have
[46:44] Faith the five letter f word faith
[46:47] Hallelujah
[46:48] see where we have pure hearts and pure
[46:50] Minds praise God
[46:52] right there's one thing we're saved by
[46:54] grace through faith Hallelujah thank God
[47:00] now church and uh and uh I heard a
[47:02] preacher say this I liked it he said all
[47:04] of us can relate to these three
[47:05] conditions I I believe I can I I've been
[47:08] in I've been in these mine all three of
[47:09] these mindsets before
[47:10] so before I started serving God I was a
[47:12] gentile pagan
[47:17] and then you know there was times I was
[47:19] trying to be a good person and I wasn't
[47:20] following God
[47:22] I was just trying to be a good boy
[47:24] that's what that is here's like I don't
[47:26] care to be a good person here's like
[47:27] well I'll try to be I'm a good person
[47:30] and then here's where we get legalistic
[47:32] sometimes
[47:33] well if I do this and this and that then
[47:34] this has to happen well only if it's
[47:36] God's will
[47:38] right
[47:39] this this is if I keep all these
[47:41] requirements I'm going to get this this
[47:42] and that well
[47:44] there's some truth to that
[47:46] but you don't want to make it your
[47:47] righteousness you want it to be God's
[47:49] righteousness
[47:51] right you want to you you don't you
[47:53] don't want to try to make God do
[47:54] something
[47:55] you want to let God do what he wants to
[47:57] do
[47:58] so see all of us can relate to these
[48:01] three mindsets
[48:02] Hallelujah
[48:04] now let's pick up here here's where we
[48:05] left off on Wednesday so finally that
[48:06] was my that's my good background here
[48:10] 40 minute background
[48:12] but I put some new stuff or some fresh
[48:13] stuff and some review stuff in there
[48:15] in there to them by who by patient
[48:17] continuance in well doing so she just
[48:19] patiently served God it'll pay off for
[48:21] you
[48:22] what are you seeking when you're patient
[48:24] God's glory and honor and eternal life
[48:28] but unto them that are contentious now
[48:30] this is like a politician basically
[48:35] putting oneself forward
[48:37] so that's what Sinners do right they try
[48:39] to put themselves forward
[48:41] and do not obey the truth but obey on
[48:43] righteousness indignation which is
[48:46] passionate anger and wrath which is
[48:47] anger
[48:48] tribulation awaits for these who are
[48:51] electioneering for themselves they're
[48:53] they're only worried about themselves
[48:54] they're living for me I'm number one
[48:55] instead of Christ is number one
[48:59] he said tribulation which is distress or
[49:01] pressure and anguish extreme Affliction
[49:04] upon every soul of that man that doeth
[49:06] evil of the Jew first and also the
[49:09] Gentile
[49:10] okay so here's the moralist group here's
[49:13] the more or less Gentile right but he
[49:15] also says even Jews
[49:17] so look it's about doing evil or doing
[49:20] good
[49:21] because faith will produce one or the
[49:23] other
[49:24] right genuine faith will produce good
[49:26] but human faith will produce evil
[49:29] notice program said there's lots of
[49:31] kinds of faith
[49:32] there's either saving Faith or there's
[49:34] human Faith right the faith you have I'm
[49:36] going to go I'm gonna go turn on my car
[49:37] and I know it's going to start that's
[49:39] human faith anybody has that
[49:41] even demons believe there's a God that's
[49:43] just that's that's faith of that's faith
[49:46] of a angel right that's Angelic Faith
[49:49] they're not humans but they have faith
[49:51] they have an intellectual faith
[49:54] right
[49:55] and then there's you know there's
[49:57] there's uh the gift of faith was to
[49:58] speak to mountains and move mountains
[50:00] right
[50:01] uh there's there's other kinds of Faith
[50:03] as well there's the fruit of faith faith
[50:06] is the Fruit of the Spirit
[50:07] right there's lots of and faith is also
[50:09] the first anointing praise God the
[50:11] statue of man there's lots of different
[50:12] kinds of faith
[50:13] or measures of Faith verse 10 but glory
[50:16] honor and peace to every man that work
[50:18] is good to the Jew first
[50:20] and also to the Gentiles how many people
[50:23] want peace in their life if you want
[50:25] peace do good things
[50:26] like we said on Wednesday you reap what
[50:29] you sow amen
[50:30] Hallelujah and people are either going
[50:32] to see it in this life or the next I
[50:34] hope in our lives they see it in both
[50:36] praise God
[50:37] I hope your co-workers or your families
[50:39] and your friends and everybody in this
[50:41] church can see your good works now and
[50:43] then we'll see Jesus reward you for them
[50:45] later at the white Throne judgment amen
[50:48] Hallelujah
[50:50] that our good works will be displayed by
[50:53] Jesus
[50:54] they'll say Well done good and faithful
[50:56] servant
[50:58] Glory
[50:59] Romans 2 11 for there's
[51:01] the persons with God
[51:04] right we all got the same opportunity to
[51:06] serve God we all have breath in our
[51:08] lungs day to serve God we all got Bibles
[51:10] to read the Bible
[51:12] we all got access to God by prayer
[51:15] we can all pray right we can all ask God
[51:18] for the desires of our heart and God
[51:20] will hear everyone if they're sincere
[51:22] praise God
[51:23] there's no respect to persons with God
[51:27] so in other words as high as you want to
[51:29] get in Christ you can reach it
[51:32] don't brother said I would never get in
[51:34] the way of anybody that has a faith to
[51:36] be like Enoch that's a brother said
[51:39] program said I may not have the faith to
[51:41] do it and it wasn't God's timing for him
[51:42] to do it right God had to save you God
[51:45] had to save me God had to save a
[51:47] generation after brother Brown praise
[51:49] God maybe more we don't know
[51:52] but may everybody be encouraged you can
[51:54] go as high as you were in Christ today
[51:56] because God is not a respective person
[51:58] whatever you put in that's what you'll
[52:01] get out praise God
[52:03] amen
[52:05] verse 12.
[52:09] I had a brother uh
[52:11] just as an encouragement I had a brother
[52:13] a couple Brothers email me this week
[52:14] they said they said One Day in heaven he
[52:16] said I could just he said I listened to
[52:17] your sermons almost every day he said I
[52:19] can't wait to give you a hug in heaven
[52:21] I said well if I get to heaven I got at
[52:23] least one person that wants to hug me so
[52:25] that's a good sign
[52:26] I said thank you sir
[52:28] that means a lot to me praise God
[52:31] Hallelujah for as many of us have sinned
[52:33] without law Shall Perish without law
[52:36] and as many as I've sinned in the law
[52:39] shall be judged by the law so whether
[52:41] you had Moses law or didn't you're still
[52:43] judged
[52:45] right and why is that
[52:47] now I want to just stop here for a
[52:49] moment now this is why Jesus came
[52:51] without respect to persons or no
[52:53] partiality Jesus has no partiality
[52:56] that means he doesn't like men more than
[52:58] women
[52:59] so sisters be encouraged he likes you
[53:00] just as much as the brothers
[53:03] he's not partial
[53:04] children he likes you just as much as us
[53:06] older people my God
[53:09] or younger older people
[53:11] and he's going to say this you're either
[53:12] one of the other either you're doing
[53:14] well and working good or you're doing
[53:16] evil
[53:18] it's either one of the other it's so
[53:19] simple in his sight his fiery eyes right
[53:22] can tell right away either it's a good
[53:24] heart or an evil heart thank God we've
[53:26] got good Hearts amen that love Jesus
[53:28] praise God he sees our every desire he
[53:31] sees our every action
[53:32] that's why church when we see you know
[53:34] our sin in our members that's why Paul
[53:36] said when we see it rising up we got to
[53:38] crucify it praise God
[53:40] if you be risen with Christ crucify the
[53:43] lust of the reflection lessen the
[53:45] affections there I'll praise God
[53:48] if you've had a resurrection if you've
[53:49] had an Easter in your own life crucify
[53:51] the things of the flesh the desires of
[53:54] the flesh praise God
[53:55] Hallelujah
[53:59] Romans 2 13 for not the hearers of the
[54:02] law and so just because we come to
[54:03] church we're not justified
[54:05] we're Justified because we do we're
[54:08] doers of the law
[54:11] in other words God declares you
[54:12] righteous because you obey his word
[54:15] Hallelujah
[54:16] for when the Gentiles which had now
[54:18] here's the one where we talk about uh
[54:20] every tribe in the jungles that don't
[54:21] have Bibles and uncivilized communities
[54:24] or the Aborigines out in Australia
[54:27] here's a scripture that proves they'll
[54:29] all be judged by God
[54:31] for when the Gentiles which have not the
[54:34] law do by Nature the things contained in
[54:36] the law these having not the law are
[54:39] alone to themselves
[54:41] see so whatever laws they establish
[54:43] they'll be judged by those laws and a
[54:46] lot of them line up with God's laws
[54:48] right like brother man this is that one
[54:50] I couldn't remember in Africa brother
[54:52] and visited a tribe where a woman if she
[54:55] was caught having fornication before
[54:57] marriage she'd be stoned and brother man
[54:59] makes a kind of like a sad joke he says
[55:01] if they brought that to America how many
[55:03] young women we have left
[55:05] and what about the men that deserve it
[55:07] as well according to Jewish law the men
[55:08] deserve it as well
[55:10] how many young people would have left I
[55:11] know we have some here praise God thank
[55:13] God Amen by God's grace
[55:17] see but whatever laws they have
[55:19] established in their tribes
[55:21] it's a it's a it's a a testimony that
[55:25] God put right and wrong in their hearts
[55:27] already
[55:28] and notice what do they do they bear
[55:30] witness that God's laws in their hearts
[55:32] and their thoughts because they excuse
[55:35] or else excuse one another they either
[55:37] accuse others or they excuse others
[55:40] Hallelujah
[55:42] and that shows they have God's word
[55:44] written in their hearts they know right
[55:46] from wrong and they can accuse someone
[55:47] right or accuse someone wrong
[55:50] or they can excuse have mercy on someone
[55:51] or not have mercy on someone
[55:54] aren't you glad the Bible has all the
[55:55] answers
[55:56] oh it's a blessing and I use this verse
[55:58] all the time this is one of the greatest
[55:59] verses I think well it's hard to say
[56:01] that but this is one of the most
[56:03] important verses in the Bible
[56:04] because each one of our family members
[56:06] right we're seeing our family members
[56:07] today every one of them are going to be
[56:09] judged by Paul's gospel
[56:12] in that day when God shall judge the
[56:15] secrets of men by Jesus Christ according
[56:18] to my gospel
[56:20] like brother man preached that sermon
[56:21] the door and the doors May Church may we
[56:23] open every door in our heart and say
[56:25] Jesus Come into this city come into this
[56:26] room
[56:27] I don't want to I don't want to I don't
[56:29] want to keep any secrets from you
[56:31] I'm struggling with this help me Lord to
[56:33] overcome
[56:34] give me Grace Lord to have victory in
[56:37] this area of my life come in to every
[56:39] part of my thinking
[56:42] May the words of my mouth and the
[56:44] meditations of my heart be acceptable in
[56:47] thy sight oh God
[56:49] Grant it Lord Jesus Hallelujah
[56:52] behold Thou Art called a Jew and rest Us
[56:55] in the law and make us thy boasts of God
[56:57] and know us his will and approve is the
[57:00] things that are more excellent being
[57:01] instructed out of the law okay so now he
[57:03] breaks into this next group this is the
[57:05] the Jews
[57:07] the legalists here we'll get to here
[57:09] verse 19. and our confidence so the Jews
[57:12] were confident that thou thyself are to
[57:15] guide to the blind a light of them which
[57:17] are in darkness
[57:18] so the Jews that had the law of Moses
[57:20] they were confident were the guides
[57:23] we're lights for them who are blind
[57:26] and what does it show here legalists can
[57:28] become self-confident or prideful
[57:33] right we got to be careful Church we're
[57:35] supposed especially as ministers we're
[57:36] supposed to be leaders of men but we
[57:38] can't think that it's our own
[57:39] righteousness that does it
[57:42] it's God's righteousness we can't be
[57:44] confident ourselves we've got to be
[57:46] confident in the power of the cross
[57:48] the power of daily dying amen the power
[57:52] of every day taking up your cross and
[57:54] following Jesus that's the only one
[57:55] who's worthy to follow as a man
[57:58] is those who follow Jesus wholeheartedly
[58:00] praise God
[58:03] the Jews in verse 20 said they were
[58:05] instructor of the foolish a teacher of
[58:09] babes which has the form of knowledge
[58:11] and of the truth in the law
[58:15] so Paul's Paul's rebuking them you're so
[58:18] self-confident you're you're a guide
[58:20] everybody else is foolish does it sound
[58:22] familiar
[58:23] some message churches got this same
[58:25] attitude
[58:27] right like I was telling Emma there's
[58:28] some churches that they think nobody can
[58:30] get saved outside of the message what a
[58:33] bunch of nonsense
[58:34] that's exactly what they become they
[58:35] become this
[58:37] nobody can get saved outside of me
[58:39] like you're going to live forever like
[58:41] on this Earth
[58:43] like you're all-powerful no you're not
[58:46] you're just you're just one Pebble on
[58:48] the beach right Hallelujah you're one
[58:50] little Pebble on the beach
[58:53] see we've got to be careful this is the
[58:55] legalist attitude and it comes in to the
[58:57] message
[59:00] and here's how you know thou therefore
[59:02] which teaches another teaches thou not
[59:05] thyself thou that preachest a man should
[59:07] not steal Dost thou steal
[59:10] but see it all starts with the leaders
[59:12] the leaders are saying don't steal but
[59:15] are stealing
[59:16] that produces hypocrites
[59:18] all right that produces hypocrisy
[59:21] and then it works down to everybody else
[59:23] praise God oh God give us clean hearts
[59:26] Clean Hands
[59:28] Hallelujah
[59:29] let's live righteously before God and
[59:32] before the church
[59:34] thou says a man should not commit
[59:36] adultery Dost thou commit adultery
[59:39] thou Horus Idols thus thou commit
[59:42] sacrilege
[59:44] like we said people can make brother
[59:45] Branham an idol you can make the tapes
[59:47] an idol you can pronounce you can make a
[59:49] husband and wife he said a piano a car
[59:51] you can make anything an item
[59:53] right and Jesus said if you look on a
[59:56] woman and lust after her you've already
[59:57] committed adultery
[59:59] right
[1:00:01] and this is what leaders especially
[1:00:03] leaders but all of us have to make sure
[1:00:05] we're not living a a legalistic
[1:00:07] hypocritical life but each day we take
[1:00:10] up the cross and Die daily praise God
[1:00:13] amen I'm not gonna have any Idols in my
[1:00:16] life amen I'm going to have if your
[1:00:18] heart praise God I'm going to meditate
[1:00:20] on the things of God hallelujah
[1:00:22] thank God
[1:00:24] thou that maketh thy boasts of the law
[1:00:27] through breaking the law dishonor thou
[1:00:29] God
[1:00:31] so in one way they boast look at all
[1:00:32] that we do but then they break other
[1:00:34] parts of God's law
[1:00:37] now look the church this is serious look
[1:00:39] for the here's the danger of legalism
[1:00:41] and it's what that's what we got to
[1:00:42] watch for
[1:00:44] see George look at those other see those
[1:00:46] three areas Paul's talking to we're not
[1:00:48] going to be the heathens right we're not
[1:00:50] going to start saying oh homosexuality
[1:00:51] is okay we're never going to say that
[1:00:54] we're not going to be the moralists that
[1:00:55] leave out the word we're always going to
[1:00:57] have the word so this is the one that
[1:00:59] we've gotta we've got to watch for
[1:01:01] we've got to carefully examine Our Lives
[1:01:03] not to become legalists
[1:01:06] remember legalism is when you add
[1:01:08] anything to the word of God to promote
[1:01:10] your righteousness
[1:01:12] praise God
[1:01:15] so Paul says these men are saying don't
[1:01:18] commit adultery yet they do don't have
[1:01:20] Idols yet they do
[1:01:21] and Paul says when they do this the name
[1:01:24] of Jesus is blasphemed
[1:01:27] among the Gentiles through you
[1:01:30] as it is written
[1:01:31] look Church
[1:01:34] this is why all these message people are
[1:01:35] going to be judged harshly when they
[1:01:37] fall away
[1:01:38] and I'm talking about even the ones that
[1:01:39] stay in churches
[1:01:41] and claim to believe brother Branham and
[1:01:43] they're caught in money laundering
[1:01:44] schemes and adulteries
[1:01:47] and child molestation and all these
[1:01:49] things
[1:01:51] when the world hears about it
[1:01:53] about all these sins and message
[1:01:54] churches that makes the world blasphemy
[1:01:57] the name of Jesus
[1:02:00] and they're going to be guilty of that
[1:02:01] that's why I thank God we have a clean
[1:02:04] reputation here by God's grace
[1:02:06] hallelujah thank God I want to say thank
[1:02:08] you to everyone here that loves Jesus
[1:02:10] because we got a good reputation praise
[1:02:12] God there's come no smut upon our church
[1:02:14] our church has lived in the goodness of
[1:02:16] God Amen
[1:02:18] amen you've lived in the purity of this
[1:02:20] gospel and let's keep it that way praise
[1:02:22] God yeah we all fall short and we all
[1:02:24] make mistakes but by God's grace God's
[1:02:26] cut this from from from Big evil Wicked
[1:02:29] sins like that and we're just all of our
[1:02:31] Christian Soldiers marching to Victory
[1:02:33] praise God
[1:02:34] amen
[1:02:37] Hallelujah like I told you the biggest
[1:02:39] church in America a few years ago had a
[1:02:40] murder in it
[1:02:43] one of the members had a daughter who
[1:02:46] was insane and she took a shotgun and
[1:02:48] killed her father and he was like one of
[1:02:50] the main singers in the church
[1:02:53] and then they're the church that does
[1:02:54] that inner they're against interracial
[1:02:56] marriage so Seth look at that stain on
[1:02:58] the church
[1:02:59] the biggest church in Canada 20 years
[1:03:00] ago had a pastor
[1:03:03] who let sexual molestation go on his
[1:03:06] church and didn't report it to the
[1:03:08] authorities
[1:03:09] because it was in his family
[1:03:12] and look off and it brings such a
[1:03:14] reproach now I'm not saying it's
[1:03:16] blasphemy it could be I don't know it's
[1:03:17] up to God
[1:03:19] but look at that When sin is allowed and
[1:03:21] sin is petted oh may God help us to let
[1:03:24] the sword of the word be preached this
[1:03:26] morning amen ah thank God see at some
[1:03:30] point the real word of God wasn't being
[1:03:33] preached in those churches may God up
[1:03:35] our church to always preach the truth of
[1:03:37] God's word hallelujah
[1:03:39] and may you and I obey the word of God
[1:03:42] that's being preached not just here as
[1:03:45] well as a good sermon but let's do what
[1:03:47] the word of God says not do what brother
[1:03:49] Jesse does or do it though Jesse says do
[1:03:52] what the Bible says amen
[1:03:54] and that'll keep us walking the
[1:03:56] righteous of God well white robes on
[1:03:58] Amen the Bible said blameless amen
[1:04:01] hallelujah the Sons and Daughters of God
[1:04:03] hallelujah oh my God thank God I know
[1:04:06] I'm going almost had an hour here I got
[1:04:07] 55 minutes I can tell you're getting
[1:04:09] tired so bear with me here my voice is
[1:04:11] actually getting tired
[1:04:13] Hallelujah
[1:04:14] but see it's Hypocrites that cause God's
[1:04:17] name to be blasphemed
[1:04:19] and church that's what these people that
[1:04:21] leave the message that believe to sign
[1:04:23] people and
[1:04:24] they they love to see message churches
[1:04:27] get scandals because they do this
[1:04:30] they blaspheme brother random they
[1:04:32] blaspheme the message
[1:04:34] they speak evil which means blasphemy in
[1:04:36] this case it means speak evil against
[1:04:38] they just can't wait till some message
[1:04:40] church falls and then they can blaspheme
[1:04:43] against it
[1:04:44] well I'm glad that I'm glad that we
[1:04:46] haven't blasphemed amen I'm glad that
[1:04:48] our lives speak Holiness unto Jesus
[1:04:51] I'm going to be one we're gonna be one
[1:04:52] of those few churches that stand on the
[1:04:54] word of God hallelujah
[1:04:56] thank God Amen
[1:04:59] the Bible said we're blameless
[1:05:00] Hallelujah
[1:05:02] and we live an honest and good life
[1:05:04] before the people praise God
[1:05:07] thank God
[1:05:10] now this that scripture reminded me of
[1:05:12] this scripture
[1:05:14] so see it even goes to our home life
[1:05:17] we've got to honor Jesus Christ in our
[1:05:19] home life or else our neighbors will see
[1:05:21] our lives and they'll blaspheme the
[1:05:23] gospel if we're not living the right way
[1:05:25] right that's what the Bible says look at
[1:05:27] Titus the age women likewise are older
[1:05:29] sisters that they be in Behavior has
[1:05:31] becometh Holiness not false accusers not
[1:05:34] given to much wine teachers of good
[1:05:36] things
[1:05:38] now what are the elder sister is
[1:05:40] supposed to do teach the young women to
[1:05:42] be sober right not be silly to love
[1:05:45] their husbands to love their children to
[1:05:47] be discreet Chase keepers at home good
[1:05:50] obedient to their own husbands
[1:05:53] that the word of God be not blasphemed
[1:05:58] see
[1:05:59] so when a when a couple or when a family
[1:06:01] disobeys the word of God and let's say
[1:06:03] they
[1:06:04] let's say a family has let's just use a
[1:06:07] wife or husband let's say let's say
[1:06:09] there's a husband that abuses the wife
[1:06:10] and the neighbors found out on it the
[1:06:12] neighbors will blaspheme God because of
[1:06:14] that abuse
[1:06:16] or a wife that yells at and disrespects
[1:06:18] the husband the neighbors will hear
[1:06:19] about that and they'll blast him say
[1:06:21] look they go to church every Sunday they
[1:06:22] dress up and look that's they're just
[1:06:24] there's nothing to it
[1:06:26] and that blasting is the name of God
[1:06:29] see Church we're all responsible before
[1:06:31] God
[1:06:32] Hallelujah and of course God is the god
[1:06:35] of Mercy Hallelujah God's going to help
[1:06:37] us hallelujah he's here to strengthen us
[1:06:39] praise God he's here to give us our
[1:06:41] hearts desire and what greater desire
[1:06:43] can we be than to live a life that
[1:06:45] honors Jesus praise God
[1:06:47] and if you want a life that honors Jesus
[1:06:49] he'll help you do it praise God
[1:06:52] amen
[1:06:55] Dr Romans 2 I want to finish Romans 2
[1:06:57] today
[1:06:58] I'm about at an hour
[1:07:00] okay so now he's getting to the
[1:07:01] legalistic Jews for circumcision barely
[1:07:04] profiteth if thou keep the law
[1:07:07] okay
[1:07:09] so this church struggled this is one of
[1:07:11] the struggles of the Roman Church
[1:07:13] the the Jews the Jewish Christians were
[1:07:15] saying well your your babies your boys
[1:07:16] aren't circumcised
[1:07:18] that's wrong when they're saying well I
[1:07:21] don't know if that's wrong or not
[1:07:22] right I don't know
[1:07:24] so Paul's to lay it out and says
[1:07:27] he says uh if you keep circumcision
[1:07:30] that's good if you keep the rest of the
[1:07:31] law but if you break the law your
[1:07:34] circumcision is made on circumcision
[1:07:37] so see if you obey one part of God's
[1:07:40] word you got to obey the rest
[1:07:42] praise God
[1:07:44] therefore if the UNS if the Jew if the
[1:07:46] Gentiles rather keep the righteousness
[1:07:48] of the law look shall not his
[1:07:50] uncircumcision be counted for
[1:07:52] circumcision
[1:07:53] in other words God is looking at the
[1:07:55] heart
[1:07:57] God's looking at the heart that's what
[1:07:58] wants to obey all the word of God
[1:08:02] we have to obey all the word of God
[1:08:04] here other scriptures came to my mind go
[1:08:06] to if you got the your Bible go to the
[1:08:07] New Testament here
[1:08:11] yeah that's right somebody was emailing
[1:08:12] me uh from another church and ask him
[1:08:15] about the law
[1:08:17] go to Matthew yeah 23 23 that should be
[1:08:20] familiar
[1:08:24] and this is the this is helpful as a
[1:08:26] Christian as well
[1:08:27] what I mean is church there's an hour
[1:08:32] what I mean is you know
[1:08:34] we want to come in the message and yes
[1:08:36] we want to repent we want to be buried
[1:08:37] in the name of Lord Jesus Christ we want
[1:08:39] to believe God sent brother Branham we
[1:08:41] want to know all these scriptures but we
[1:08:42] got to go more than that
[1:08:44] we got to keep going into the things of
[1:08:46] God
[1:08:47] praise God
[1:08:49] right that's the way to honor and
[1:08:51] glorify Jesus right to to continue to
[1:08:54] keep all the message amen
[1:08:56] we got to keep all the message the best
[1:08:58] we can
[1:08:59] right
[1:09:00] I'm sorry it was Matthew 23. Lydia I'm
[1:09:03] sorry graduation girl can you read that
[1:09:04] please
[1:09:06] yeah 23 23.
[1:09:19] amen thank you hun
[1:09:21] so Jesus said you should have done the
[1:09:23] tithes and offerings but you should have
[1:09:25] also shown judgment mercy and faith
[1:09:31] these are more weighty than even paying
[1:09:33] your ties and offerings how many know
[1:09:34] ties and offering is just the beginning
[1:09:35] that's that's an elementary that's an
[1:09:37] easy thing to do the church said
[1:09:39] ties and offering is easy
[1:09:41] that's a that's an elementary thing
[1:09:43] right
[1:09:44] but if you want to be more spiritual
[1:09:45] more mature say God give me a spirit of
[1:09:49] judgment or discernment
[1:09:51] help me to show Mercy
[1:09:54] and help me have faith in your promises
[1:09:57] now you're getting somewhere with God
[1:09:58] now you're going up that stature now
[1:10:00] you're being mature and if you're born
[1:10:01] again nah you're being real mature by
[1:10:03] God's grace now God can use you in a
[1:10:06] greater way
[1:10:09] so I thought this was just support I
[1:10:10] shared this with somebody they said
[1:10:14] oh Jesus never told people to obey the
[1:10:19] obey the he said you should have did
[1:10:20] that but you should have done more than
[1:10:21] that amen you left out some of it
[1:10:24] Hallelujah but Churchill we got the Holy
[1:10:26] Ghost it'll not leave out anything it'll
[1:10:29] guide us into all truth hallelujah John
[1:10:32] 16 13 amen thank God
[1:10:35] Glory now 27. Romans 2 27 and Shout Out
[1:10:40] Gentile which is uncircumcision which is
[1:10:42] by nature if it fulfill the law judge
[1:10:45] thee
[1:10:46] who buy the letter and circumcision dust
[1:10:48] transgress the law is that something
[1:10:50] Paul says a gentile that's not
[1:10:53] circumcised could judge a Jew who
[1:10:55] circumcised and yet who disobeys the law
[1:10:57] God would see a righteous obedient heart
[1:11:00] more than a heart that just obeyed that
[1:11:02] for the outward appearance of things
[1:11:04] God looks at the heart
[1:11:08] God doesn't look so much with the
[1:11:09] outward appearance God looks at our
[1:11:11] hearts today
[1:11:13] oh what a comfort to know that praise
[1:11:15] God what a comfort to know
[1:11:18] I'm almost done here by God's grace I
[1:11:20] think 29 might be the last verse
[1:11:24] thank the Lord
[1:11:25] Romans 2 28 for he is not a Jew which is
[1:11:29] one outwardly
[1:11:30] neither is that circumcision which is
[1:11:33] outward in the flesh
[1:11:35] now Church remember that Covenant with
[1:11:37] with circumcision from Genesis 17 that
[1:11:39] was super important
[1:11:41] if the males didn't have that they could
[1:11:44] not even be in the camp
[1:11:46] you couldn't even go to church in other
[1:11:48] words unless all the males were
[1:11:49] circumcised you couldn't even sacrifice
[1:11:52] right you could even be a part of
[1:11:53] Abraham's lineage unless you had this
[1:11:56] but Paul says this was all pointed to
[1:11:59] something Paul says this was a shadow
[1:12:01] praise God in other words that every man
[1:12:04] and every woman have a heart that
[1:12:06] circumcised
[1:12:08] that's the real point of this
[1:12:11] that the old life the old desires will
[1:12:14] be cut away permanently and there will
[1:12:16] be a permanent change that each person
[1:12:18] would be a new creature a new a new
[1:12:21] heart in Jesus Christ hallelujah oh my
[1:12:25] verse 29 but he is a Jew which is one
[1:12:28] inwardly and circumcision is that of the
[1:12:32] heart in the spirit
[1:12:34] and not in the letter whose praise is
[1:12:37] not a men but of God
[1:12:39] I just want to stop on there just for a
[1:12:41] moment here let me yeah let me show the
[1:12:42] definition here
[1:12:45] 's the definition of circumcision now
[1:12:47] this is the natural here's the spiritual
[1:12:49] this one applies to us here
[1:12:53] so a circumcision is is metaphoric of
[1:12:56] Christians separated from the unclean
[1:12:58] multitude
[1:13:00] and truly consecrated to God
[1:13:03] the extinction of Passions
[1:13:06] and the remu removal of spiritual
[1:13:09] impurity
[1:13:11] and the church said
[1:13:14] hallelujah how many want to be a real
[1:13:17] spiritual Jew praise God
[1:13:19] said it's a holy ghost thing praise God
[1:13:21] it's not that we're the 144 000 or or
[1:13:24] you are the tribe of Judah or you have I
[1:13:26] Asher you're Asher
[1:13:28] she has a brother named Asher
[1:13:30] oh I try to we're not trying to figure
[1:13:32] out our natural lineage of that's not
[1:13:33] what we're after we're just after that
[1:13:35] we are God's people praise God Amen that
[1:13:39] God is blind in Israel and now he's got
[1:13:41] a gentile bride amen now he's got a
[1:13:43] church praise God a bride that loves him
[1:13:46] who is totally dedicated to him and her
[1:13:49] heart is so holy completely sold out for
[1:13:51] Jesus amen
[1:13:53] I think thank you Jesus amen
[1:13:58] what is a circumcised Christian he or
[1:14:02] she's separated from the unclean
[1:14:03] multitude
[1:14:06] I think it was beautiful it was just
[1:14:07] fitting yesterday
[1:14:09] how our graduation ceremony now Emma
[1:14:11] would know best because she's been the
[1:14:12] she was at a a public school graduation
[1:14:15] recently right for her graduation so
[1:14:17] it's been a while since my wife and I
[1:14:19] have been to a public graduation
[1:14:20] ceremony
[1:14:23] but I'm sure without a doubt Lydia's
[1:14:26] graduation ceremony looked totally
[1:14:27] different than the public schools
[1:14:30] they had prayer numerous times we sang
[1:14:32] what three hymns
[1:14:34] Hallelujah
[1:14:36] I guess we saw a few uh immorally
[1:14:38] Dressed girls but not too many one too
[1:14:40] many
[1:14:40] but at the school at the worldly Public
[1:14:43] School
[1:14:44] there have been a lot of worldly dress
[1:14:45] people
[1:14:46] right it would have been the rock and
[1:14:48] roll and all kinds of things like that
[1:14:52] but what what a contrast and at Lydia's
[1:14:55] graduation we got the preaching of the
[1:14:57] word boy that preacher like he bought
[1:14:59] out uh critical race Theory
[1:15:01] homosexuality what else abortion
[1:15:05] transgenderism
[1:15:07] Catholic Church wow that's a pretty good
[1:15:09] that's amount of Grace right there five
[1:15:11] is Grace that's a pretty good portion of
[1:15:13] Grace
[1:15:14] it is a good sign that we are separated
[1:15:18] from the things of the world
[1:15:19] but I know that we go a lot deeper than
[1:15:21] that by God's grace we can go even
[1:15:22] deeper than that into the Seven Seals
[1:15:24] marriage and Navarre amen the serpent
[1:15:27] seed amen hallelujah the seven Thunders
[1:15:30] even the seven Church ages we go deep
[1:15:32] into the word of God the Deep things of
[1:15:35] God hallelujah
[1:15:37] thank God
[1:15:39] and we are Church by if
[1:15:42] if we have to be we're truly consecrated
[1:15:44] to God show me another group who's more
[1:15:46] consecrated God
[1:15:47] I'd like to see it
[1:15:49] but Ram said the denominations will
[1:15:51] outwork us because they have more money
[1:15:53] and they got more people he said another
[1:15:55] church age book
[1:15:57] he said that but he says it kind of in a
[1:15:58] joke he said but that's just like the
[1:16:00] mule outworking another like a like a
[1:16:02] lamb or something like that
[1:16:04] so we can't look at everybody's Works
[1:16:06] look at your spiritual condition praise
[1:16:08] God
[1:16:09] look at your heart praise God amen
[1:16:12] look at your nature do you have a word
[1:16:14] nature or denominational Works nature we
[1:16:17] got the nature of Jesus Christ praise
[1:16:20] God and yes we should do works and yes
[1:16:22] we do praise God
[1:16:23] and we need constant reminders how many
[1:16:26] need reminders to pray give alms in the
[1:16:27] fast how many reminders of that I do I
[1:16:30] do we all do I all get I get so busy
[1:16:32] sometimes I forget to pray I forget to
[1:16:33] fast I forget to give all homes you know
[1:16:35] you I get so focused on paying the bills
[1:16:36] and getting this done getting this done
[1:16:37] for the school and getting this
[1:16:39] sometimes I need reminders of that I
[1:16:40] thank God for that
[1:16:42] praise God
[1:16:45] but he's God's ultimately looking at
[1:16:46] whose heart is circumcised unto Christ
[1:16:51] who is truly separated from the unclean
[1:16:53] multitude
[1:16:54] and consecrated to Christ
[1:16:58] and my last thought about this uh I
[1:17:00] think
[1:17:02] my last thought about this is that
[1:17:04] it's a circumcision of the spirit so
[1:17:06] this this can mean both what's in the
[1:17:08] spirit the soul and the mind
[1:17:11] right
[1:17:12] we say the spirit is a human Spirit and
[1:17:14] the inside of that is the core of the
[1:17:16] spirit is the soul
[1:17:18] so this means church we need a
[1:17:20] circumcision in our soul you know all
[1:17:22] the unbelief in our soul that's got to
[1:17:24] get cut out when we get saved
[1:17:27] but our daily circumcision that's what
[1:17:29] it is it's a daily circumcision is in
[1:17:32] the mind
[1:17:33] in our thinking praise God
[1:17:35] we can't let evil thoughts creep into
[1:17:37] our minds
[1:17:39] and and help and and start making us
[1:17:41] think about passions of the world or
[1:17:43] lust of the eyes and pride of life and
[1:17:45] lust of the flesh those had to be
[1:17:47] circumcised out every single day because
[1:17:49] the circumcision is in the thinking as
[1:17:52] well
[1:17:53] we have to make sure our thinking stays
[1:17:55] with the word of God
[1:17:57] let's stand to our feet I'm gonna stop
[1:17:58] right there musicians can come I don't I
[1:18:00] don't want to go too far in chapter
[1:18:01] three I was ready to go a little bit
[1:18:03] further but let me stop right there
[1:18:06] how many love the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:18:08] today with all your heart
[1:18:10] are you thankful for a seven-fold person
[1:18:12] praise God
[1:18:13] oh we're so grateful for God's grace
[1:18:17] Hallelujah
[1:18:18] let's bow our heads here for a moment
[1:18:25] you know Church let's let's pray hear
[1:18:27] that by God's grace
[1:18:28] we'll have our thoughts circumcised to
[1:18:31] the word of
[1:18:33] word if we saw that we won't be
[1:18:36] your own self-righteousness
[1:18:38] but we will be hearers and doers of the
[1:18:41] word of God
[1:18:44] I love how the holy spirit makes it so
[1:18:45] simple
[1:18:47] we must hear it and do it praise God
[1:18:51] we must put into action the things that
[1:18:54] the Lord has revealed to us
