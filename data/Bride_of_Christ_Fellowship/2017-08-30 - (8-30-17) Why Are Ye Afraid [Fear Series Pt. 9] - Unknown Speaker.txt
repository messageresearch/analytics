after you 824 I'd like to continue on the fear series and preach tonight why are ye fearful I like to preach Jesus's words there why are you fearful Matthew a 24 by the grace of the Lord very familiar story this week I listened to the sermon go away Jesus from 1963 so even though I got this raishin for this message that's where I got the inspiration from that message and of course from heaven by God's grace by the Holy Spirit so we like to listen to that I think you would enjoy it by the grace of the Lord Matthew 8 24 through there segment and behold there arose a great tempest in the sea in so much that the ship was covered with the waves but he was asleep and his disciples came to him and awoke him saying lord save us we perish he saith unto them why are ye fearful o ye of little faith then he arose and rebuked the winds and the sea and there was a great calm but the men marvelled saying what manner of man is this that even the wind's and the sea obey what manner of man is our Lord Jesus Christ and he's got bad that's not what is writing on your heart is making as we approach Heavenly Father we love you tonight Lord these words are just as true to ninety two thousand years later as they were or the night miss happened dear God as the disciples and you were crossing the Sea of Galilee Lord got the Lord what manner of man you are Lord but even the wind's and the sea obey your God how much more tonight Lord will the situation than the storms of Our Lives obey your word Lord whatever your word would safety us up us to hear your word this evening Lord God we know there's natural flooding Lord God in our country we ask God that you move back the waters Lord God the souls and lives might be saved father we also know the enemy comes in like a flood well we know there's times it seems as though Satan is flooding into our lives Lord and overwhelming us and as we have no answer for the floods of scenes trials and temptations father we asked in Jesus Christ day the Spirit of God raises the standard against the Lord God bring the great column to the to our lives Lord God bring great Lord victory to our lives and we'll give you all the glory Lord take us a little higher in Christ tonight Lord God as we sit at your feet Lord as Mary sat at your feet man we receive something tonight Lord that will not be taken from us Lord God for we've chosen to sit at your dear feet in order to have the nail prints and then Lord God we'd say those bloody feet Lord God that left the bloody footprints Lord we've chosen as to the truth means our night dear Jesus and we know you will need this supportive ellicott when we come to worship you and the year that I want to the Lord answer to us now about the grace of the Holy Spirit in Jesus Christ that we did which I said maybe see you there grace god complete house of lords night one see the Saints here tonight God's face praise the Lord I can look at the start here tonight why are you here we should be here said we're not here for anymore there's any fear in us we should be here say we're not fearful that did you notice the ship was covered with ways you notice that many times our lives feel like we're just covered in confusion we're covered in fear we're covered in trials to see Mike work we're coming home were covered Church were covered seemed like everywhere our lives are just overwhelmed with trials and no doubt that's what the disciples were feeling here they're covered with Williams I gather Bibles let's go to Luke 822 there's another way to look at it here I kind of want to build off of Sunday's message about the law of perfect faith a little bit like to build off of that by the grace of Lord tonight now it came to pass on a certain day Luke 822 that he said I'm sorry that he went into a ship with his disciples and he said unto them let us go over unto the other side of the lake and they launched forth so sea they went into this they went into this voyage at his command you've gone into your life at his command he sent you for he's the one that sent you out into the sea how many believe that he's the one that sent you out inaccurate where's the love right David ye Center sport and if he sends forth and he's with us he's always going to be with him hey man as they found out verse 23 as they sailed he fell asleep and there came down a storm of wind on the lake noticed a came down right from the prints and power of the air look at that in a moment and they were fiddled with water and were in jeopardy so their lives were in jeopardy their lives were hanging the balance and not only was it covered in waves but the waves were coming in it was coming in to their ship the the trouble was coming in very close to that as you can see right and they came name awoke him saying master master we perish then he arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water and they ceased and there was a call and he said that where is your faith and they being afraid wondered say one another what manner of man is this for he commanded even the winds of the water they obey Him and they arrived at the country of the gadarenes which is over against Galilee amen now another portion I don't have I don't remember where it is in mark or I think it's a mark but Jesus said o ye of little faith or he said you have no faith so one place he said little pate another place he said you have no faith so what do we understand that member jesus prayed for Peter and his crucifixion remember right before that and said I prayed for you that your faith fail not so the disciples had faith but in this situation they didn't have faith right didn't have a whole lot of faith and that's what Jesus is saying here they have little faith in this situation because remember we said last a few weeks ago they had faith enough to wake him up grace God that makes enough to find somebody that could bring the word to Baxter right they had enough faith to do that but when it came to speaking themselves for as little of me speaking this big huge storm of waste they had no or little favorite in that situation but they had faith in Christ right and that faith could not be taken from that because jesus said pray for that maybe then and Jesus loved that a Jesus called them and Jesus was with them but when it came down to this situation of their lives their faith wasn't strong enough to meet the challenge of the hour I've never been there before where you felt like your faith wasn't strong enough to beat the challenge of the hour when it comes down to it we remember that Jesus said there's no trial given to you that's too much for you to bury then so their faith was strong enough to bear in this case their faith wasn't strong enough to speak but their faith was strong enough to find somebody that would speak the Word of God it church many times it happens to us I think it brought ourselves you know many times when we come up for prayer that's why we come up for prayer we wanted the unite our faith with somebody else what are you not even the preacher we were united with the church and that's a good thing to do we should call the house with the church the Bible said and pray the prayer of faith that's why we pray together that's why we gather together rain but perhaps if you got perfect faith you wouldn't even need to come up for air and then it would happen right like that right again perfect bait it would happen instantly but how they don't realize we need that faith of others to be united with our faith that's why I was fine it's wonderful to come up and pray we're just you DYI we're putting our face with somebody else's faith and that's a wonderful thing to do now I want to begin by looking at these socks here and the prophets of the context of this story was Jesus just got done with a great healing campaign have you read the earlier the chapter in chapter 8 and brother bears of this but if said Jesus foresaw that after he sailed across this lake or the Sea of Galilee he foresaw that he had to deal with the maniac of Gamera who was a demon-possessed man right so Jesus was probably praying and fasting this whole time because some demons only go out by prayer fasting he just out of campaigns right he's preached all days pray all day if anybody had a right to be tired or sleepy it was our Lord because he just got through tiring feeties right and any of anyone that knows the Spirit of God when the Spirit of God is flowing through you and people are pulling on you for hurts you you get weak right I've seen it numerous times of people get he owner or God if people really want another word of God I believe you're totally drained it's hard to wake up Monday morning or Thursday morning it's hard to wake up because if they're pulling virtue out of you the box of the type of Jesus and birch went out of him and so in this case Jesus without you weren't you falling out of it he knows he foresaw my vision I've got to deal with that demon the Legion of demons I gotta deal with them so brother have said he was tired after preaching a pray for the sick he knew he had to cast out the demons out of Legion so he wanted to get some rest but Maddox said he was so humid he could cry he was so human he could even die program said he said now the in other words he said the great revival their last campaign was over he said and the sciples gather he said that the front of the ship while Jesus is sleeping and he said prevents types them but that place there on the boat now and the revivals over Jesus is sleeping the disciples are gathered around and prevents that they're discussing what they just saw Jesus dude brother types of to say that this he said in our day he said we just got through a great healing revival meetings of the forties and fifties and sixties he's tightening into that we just got through them but he said we saw the the dead raised he said we saw the blind receive their sight and the cripples walk he said we saw all of that and he said now he said we're in the time after the revival and we're discussing what Jesus's works did in the campaign but Ram said that the disciples saw Jesus do things that no other man could do 'but he was a god man he said John the Baptist had already told them that the Messiah was right among them he said there's the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world so they had all these things in their minds they're testifying Oh John the Baptist the Baptizer noticin this is the Messiah and look what he saw we saw this healing take place and we saw that he didn't take place oh my he said if the disciples were discussing about the Messiah because many of the Jews believe but many of them didn't believe and church let me say like this some people can believe so far but then there's others that can believe even farther like I had it at my physical yesterday of my doctor I got healthy blood so I thank the Lord for that I got all healthy Mark said he said he said your blood pressure so low he said there's something wrong with you he said you exercise exercise three hours a week and he said oh I'm sorry I'm tired I said I breathe three times a week elite songs four times a week and he said he thought like he said I'm so low because I didn't know exercise and I said it's just the opposite I was getting sports for so long a noun no now I've been so busy with teaching and church and everything that's my blood pressure so low my hands are constantly cold and it's nothing I'm not doing anything instead I'm trying to doing too much I told him he said that's what he said I understand these tenets he said I understand I said forgive me he said he do that but you know I'm talking to it and he looked at my height and I just know what she got on there I said I'm starting to preach on the book of Revelation the church age and he said oh he said we could we could take the whole afternoon and talk about the book of Revelation you said that I can't do it and he explained to me what it is passively his pastor believed the book of Revelation is already fulfilled art in the past he said what's your opinion he said I realized that could be heresy which I think it might be but but I don't know what the man I don't know where he stands with God's I'm not going to call him Harris that might be all he knows Church maybe he can just believe maybe brother Graham said he can just cut out salvation with the sort of thing maybe that's all he can cut out so I'm not gonna be Christianize somebody if that's all they could do so he said it might be heresy mr. Smith what do you think I said well I respect him he's the man he's got a right to believe whatever he wants I said maybe that's all he knows he says whoa but I said God says the Prophet I said name William Branham and he gave us thus saith the Lord on numerous chapters the book of Revelation so we've got the state the Lord on it and we believe it's yet to be fulfilled I said we know who the Beast is we don't be the mother heart of this we got a YouTube channel I got the first three chapters done and he said oh that's interesting he said I've already knows who your beast is yeah I don't you beast it and then he coming right off even on substantial and we never got back to that but I can say on that day that I told my doctor then we've got enough saith the Lord in the book of Revelation which I love a piece of wonderful doctor and he said he says of interesting words he said Jesse he said I have patients that are sinners and believers and he said the believers are so much more happy happy and healthier than the unbelievers I just said they're shocked I'm gonna jump back I've heard about a man say that before but I never heard a doctor tell it to me straight to my face he said oh yeah he said of it he said because they he said they have a outlet they can cast their cares upon the Lord and he said the stress that this the unbelievers have it gets to them and it creates all these problems in the lives of here's a medical doctor in Green Ohio one of the most affluent the deliver counter I say townships in this area and he sees all these rich people and the ones that are believers are healthy are the ones that are sinners harm they worship and your faith then the Bible says don't forget all God's benefits it'll be health to your body Hey read your Bible worship God it'll cast all the cares all the stress all those demons it'll pass the ball on the Lord take care of them they been well I just got that talk you don't from from from that sermon I'll go back said somebody that some did it and the doctor looked at me and he said you see you know what I find I lost my train of thought there he was telling me some of the other things about doctors and the benefits of being a Christian now maybe I'll get to it again maybe I don't remember it now kind of slipped my mind there somebody some didn't it oh yeah you said he said I come in here many times and people people will say Jesse they'll say doctor you know listen doctor you don't have to tell me what's wrong with me I just got faith to be healed and he's not I respect that he said but sometimes he looked at him and he said that's true but he said maybe God sent you to me so I could be a minister to you and the Spirit of God to flow through me to help you and I thought that's so true what a great now sin is sometimes God heals through doctors sometimes God just wants you to have faith to be healed sometimes he just want you to have a bulldog fate could best the word but other times he want you to humble yourself sometimes it goes to the doctor right he told me that and he said there's so many people he said that make himself sick by their own confession they let themselves they sick by what they say what they do and I was so do so a blown away by that that even a doctor here and he and he said that people he said don't people know though these Christians dogs and he said with all the fishes that walk in here they're always talking about how God is spanking them spanking them spanking them and he said don't they know that he's grace and he thought though they know that God is rich in grace and this is what I thought I thought well good that's true that's very true but I thought God might be spanking them if they know better but some people might not know but if that's the case God's not spanking them and they're probably beating themselves up so you got to bring a balance of that situation sometimes we beat ourselves up when we shouldn't but sometimes we do need a spanking how many understand that so that we go against God's Word when we should not and you God have to give us a little spank but even he was saying don't people know no Christians know that they can't be good enough that's why God had to send his son to die for us and here's a doctor preaching that a preacher I said glory doctor I said like that I think that's good that's right I preached a few weeks ago with the judgment of my fate if we can do it on our own that it's nothing but the blood and our good power our good conduct but the song says it's nothing but the blood of Jesus we must use to the Spirit of God we must let the Spirit of God do what we can do so I just take that thought you know the disciples we're talking about this and that's somebody even some did it we should believe medical doctors believe I know many designers that believe we should believe but we should believe more because been revealed to us I put that fade out there on my hook the State Board of proper I got a YouTube channel we did final readiness but I put it out there by God's grace maybe next time last year I got the doctor I lay hands on you and pray for you and he said yes he goes like this yes sir yes sir Lacy's ed and so I prayed for my say may the Holy Spirit flow through you to minister and heal people and that was guess when I said that I said doctor I said I believe God has a special place in heaven for doctors that love to help other greater said that but if said God has a special place in heaven for doctors that will cross rivers in the middle of night midnight and you go help a poor person who's who's sick and don't take any money for it and God has a special place in heaven for doctors that are you know about mothers Amen grandmothers how about fathers how about husbands how about wives how about children yes God has a special place in heaven for all those brother peaceful men living for eternal life not living for ourselves but living for others absolutely so I think those are the main things I remember from that meeting that's what encouraged you I got to testify the doctor the doctor gets to testify to me we had a testimony meeting kinda like this context here the disciples are sitting there testified there's Jesus sleepy because he knows he's got a demon-possessed man he's got a meeting a few months a few hours you'd say give him suppress let the master rest give him surest he's got a demon power he's got a battle and so the disciples are the top of the boat but Ram said testifying we saw Jesus do this we saw Jesus do that look at what he did and he said this he said he said st. John stood up that young Saint John stood up and he said brothers he said think of it right now the very creator heaven his earth is right with us at the ship right now because John later wrote that in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God he said think of it the man who gave up life and his sight is with us right now the man who healed to hear the paralyzed man he's with us right now the man who healed the woman the buddish you after 12 years he's with us right now I said think of it brothers the Messiah the one that Isaiah prophesied of and Ezekiel and Jeremiah and Moses all these prophecies think of it the berrywood they all wrote about is with us right now hey watch my voice here well dad said what a security it must have been the creator himself sailing with them through the waters and program said Christ is the same today he sails with us through every waters that we go through it had to start off peaceful because the Bible said the storm came down right so when they started sailing the storm was up it wasn't that it was up and maybe they couldn't see it maybe they weren't aware of it maybe they just saw it I revived with Jesus's on evening ministry maybe they didn't notice it well as they sail through the cold waters Jesus was with them Jesus with you in the calm waters Jesus with you the great revival meeting she stood with it at the storming times thank god he's with no say that he said no I'm with you even to the end of the age a man what a consolation Amen what I said what is security John could say look the same boy that did all those things and he and all these people he's with us now amen and romancin maybe we are the same as they were right now maybe we're just feasting on what we've seen done we're resting between revivals waiting on the coming of the Lord no man said we sail long and were testifying talking about our memories about what Jesus has done maybe worth that praise the Lord now let me say this from 2010 to 2013 I was in a great campaign I was doing so many miracles I wrote it down it was some of the most highly spiritual supernatural times of my life there is such an amazing time this person after person being healed and God doing different things and overseas you know Neville's Casta Naaman and kidney stones healing and our pride is healed and never they just it was just such I felt like it was kinda like that the campaign's like Jesus had but it's not closer but he said maybe were like that maybe we might not be like we're in the excitement of a revival how many could raise your hand on me honest with me and say you feel like you're in the excitement of a major revival right now honestly and I my teacher it's okay I don't see any hands go up so that's what geez that's what I was saying about the disciples they were not in the midst of the revival but they'd been a barber Bible how many been a part of revival before oh yeah absolutely when I first came in and like I said from 2010-2013 14 there her brother amen came in 2014 I better include that I was revival for me too to see God do that after I have got prayed for but I said that's what it's kind of like they're not in the midst of the big hot revival but they're in this stage of just testifying about what he's done what was Jesus with them still Church Jesus still with me today believe that you have to believe that because he promised he would be so maybe you and I tonight people are just feasting on what we thought God has done looking forward to knowing what he will do but let's not miss and see what he's doing right now that's right brother Branham said this that he said that's the troubles arose what in this time where they were in the hot revivals the big revival that could happen he said the troubles of others he said troubles arose when they were only talking about him not one of the midst of the revival so what can you expect right now troubles to rise if this isn't your hot revival timing mountaintop time then it's time for trials now I want you to go in your Bible I'm gonna go take the Genesis 6 just for a moment brother that brings out the scripture I want to make sure we read it read out could proudly say yes I know that but yeah Genesis 6 we're not going to read all of it but verses 1 to 7 reckon read on but we're just to read verse 4 how many know this is a prophecy of what the end times would be like because there's Luke 17 what Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah so shall be the days to come in O son of man look in verse 4 there were giants in the earth in those days I'll stop right here giants in the earth see brother Jesse what are you talking about why do you go back to Genesis when you're preaching on Jesus in the ship because brother Adam said this troubles arose when they were talking about he said we have so much intellectual messages today he said people can preach such a scriptural sermon you can't lay a finger on where it's wrong he said but where is God where is the manifestation of God and then we're going to said see as it was the days of Noah he said they were giants in the earth in those days where the bram said today we've got intellectual Giants a me man see that brother Williams typing the storms to intellectual Giants these are giant waves everything with me giant waves they with me you can almost the giant waves programs that represent intellectual Giants that are too smart for their own good it's all intellectual there's no supernatural like so glad when our sister Naomi spoke in tongues in February I'm that resistant where he got healing and November supernaturally Oh different ones been afraid for him so glad for that we appreciate that that's the Holy Ghost praise God moving amongst us to show us that there's a supernatural power if we just yield you a name a man say when you're not in the revival the mountaintop he said then this this time of this time of sword comes on and the giant waves represent intellectual Giants but innocent men can know Hebrew they can speak and read Hebrew but where is the revival the Prophet said it takes simplicity to bring the power of God amen hallelujah so see those giants in the earth in the days of Noah are a type of the days of Noah today with intellectual Giants we've got to have more than just preaching we've got to have power and how much power come way to all fierce taps out then you're filled with love and then when you're filled with love it outbreaks fainting then and then faith moves to the will of God now I go to 2nd Timothy 3 let's just back this up again as we have in the mouth of two or three scriptures everyone be established 2nd Timothy 3 now you know this verse 1 this is know also that the last days perilous times shall come you know what it is let's go down to verse 4 traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God now the word high byte it means this it means to cover a smoke that is to inflate with self conceit high-minded being lifted up with pride he says to be proud says so brother Adam said Wendover Bibles not on and we get in the midst of a storm intellectual Giants come against us right and that's what the scripture said this day they be high-minded they be so smart they be so full of pride but yet they love the things of the world more than things of God okay that's the condition that word can everybody see that today that's what I'm typing it today I brother have said America needs more missionaries in every country of the world because we're so intellectually smart right but it's wrong it's not kind of a good smart now they're figuring out brother said they think they're smarter than God when it comes to these things you or not we need more of God we must be filled with God if we're doing anything we must have the wholeness of God in our hearts and in our souls the baptism of the Holy Ghost but see this was promised on just like the days of Noah Giants the days today were just like that but their intellectual Giants and programs that were waiting to get to the next revival but there's intellectual Giants you've got to overcome how many will be with me to overcome the intellectual Giants in this day I'm gonna stay with us in the they then we're gonna stay with us in the African ship you're gonna jump ship and try to make it on your own you better stay with us the church you better stay with the flock because there's wolves out there there's ladies out there if you don't stay on the ship like Paul said stay in the ship and we won't lose one line then man stay with the Bride of Christ stay with those people and there will be one soul off Satan like Joshua told Rahab with a spiteful RAM whoever you get the house they're gonna be saved amen whoever you get in this house they're gonna be saved and they can't believe they met be done to us according to our faith it's exactly right let's not be high-minded heady highminded and forget the power of God that God has powers of simplicity just believing his word man just believing his word now the next thought is this how many want to see our revival in our church I create more constantly I hope you do too remember remind what is it always salsa okay there's many quotes I just start winning this sermon the ramps that they're having a great revival and new souls getting saved so he connects revival with new souls although other places these separate Bible is just reviving what we already got that's sure dude but how many want to see revival where people are reminded that means they come back to life to revive needs to come back to life Friday so sometimes people walk into Church and they don't seem spiritual I've well they revive they're going to walk into Church and they're gonna seem spiritually live the words gonna mean something to them because that is the word you cannot separate the word from God because God is the word amen it's exactly right but answer this they said many women come back to God come back to the place I don't mean come back to church necessarily I mean come back to God that every home started their Bible that's right turn out the beer can throw away the card party hallelujah what we need today is the old fashioned god-sent revival clean up the hole clean up the heart get these ready start a revival in your home and it'll begin at the church preacher don't bring the revival in his briefcase God says it from heaven to individual yeah so we could just be more faithful bringing our homes got a sentence or not intersted beside this if people don't partake of it that's up to them but we can partake of it hey whoever comes to who's ever prayed their hosts they're the ones that brings the revival and it has to start at the home it doesn't start here at church it actually starts in their home god help our homes to be on fire to Netaji's got I got cold there's been many times I've prayed God please visit our home with angels then Lydia and a patient got baptized about a year ago I was praying I was remembered tell my wife that we said they were going to get saved pretty soon and I was praying and preaching God let angels visit our home amen and the a box of the Angels rejoiced when one sinner repents how they did yeah yes so see we might be in the middle we might be in the story part it doesn't make none of us had our hand up for this is I feel like I'm on the mountaintop revival I don't I'm totally worn out physically right I'm just struggling just to stay out here by God's grace but you see we understand it we're here we should be testifying about what he's done and we should expect there's probably going to come an intellectual storm there's probably gonna come some giant against us but if we can focus on God in our home that the church experience gets even more sincere but we got to do it at home we got to focus on God at home well the way I've said then the storm came down the Bible said that the storm came down cuz Satan is the Prince and power of the air in fact of the ramps up later he said he said Satan got in the wind he said then Satan got in the whirlwind he said Satan got in the storm and brought the storm down brother and said now they're in the midst of the storm he said because of the storm he said all hosts were gone remember the Bible said they're in jeopardy we gonna live or die are we gonna live what's gonna happen but the RAM said the sails were blown down and the boat was filling up with water the Bible said your life might seem like it's filling up and you don't have much to live for right that's what the program called the church age book we have more conveniences more machines more money more blessings now than ever and people are less happy than ever how can America lead the world in suicide when we've got more money than anybody else rich kids committing suicide they've got cars dollars it shows it's not about money it's about faith amen that's what makes a person happy it's not about money it's not about character the world of riches it's about the love of Christ amen those things never satisfied how can our country lead the world in suicide how is that possible we have everything we could ever want it shows it's a lack of love it's a lack of God it's not a matter of lack for spiritual thing and our lives what will feel better when we realize is that we're lacking my tear we're lacking spiritual kings we're lacking a real sincere prayer with the Lord that's what we need the most filling up sometimes like our lives are filling up with multiple things don't we think the pressures and the cares and sicknesses and all the stress all kinds of thing our lives are filling up with in this boats filling up fast I've never prayed that recently Jesus my boats filled up fast things are getting pretty bad pretty quick right things are getting worse really fast that's what the cycles were going through my life feel really hard really fast brother Epson isn't it strange that the same man who just seems Americans a few hours ago forgot all about them he said they forgot that God raised the dead they forgot the guy who crated Brendon fish with me Church is that strange that it happened to them isn't it strange that we could see some good thing happen and a few weeks later we're just all discouraged we might rejoice and say look what God did by eye but God did a few years ago and then little water comes into our boat or say a lot of water comes into our boat and we forget how great God is it's a shame but maybe that's a change of the cycles and forgotten already it's a shame when we forget about how much God has done for us but thank God Jesus said love with me always Jesus is always with us in the boat the Prophet said the disciples had troubled and this was behind their skill to remedy but RAM said they got out the oars and they tried to push out all the water they tried to raise the sails again and raise the masts and all these things and all I hear blown down and they could do nothing their own skill and own ability could do nothing they needed help from some source amen my madam says if you're sick and the skill of the doctor cannot help our situation he said we must remember who's with us in the ship the word is with us God is the word and the word is sharper than any two-edged short on NVIDIA that's exactly right we have said no you know that the Holy Ghost is with us he said Lord remind us that you're still with you with us here program said we need you to stabilize us I don't feel like you need stabilized you're tossed this way cost that way head up down sometimes you're discouraged sometimes you're encouraged you're tossed all over the place everybody I said we need Christ is stabilized hey men be like we're on solid ground the times I've met in boats but like they were gonna see I didn't feel very stable I remember just a guy on there's just a little bit of rain storm and we're just in this little boat that had a little motor in the back and gas is leaking and all over the boat that was awful I was where he's older and we and I came when we've started driving into these huge waves that to me were there were huge they were probably like ten eight maybe max maybe max oh you know I'm better than the boat that's the most feminist by nine feet or eight feet whatever the waves look big to me they look like 30 feet tall but I'm holding over the boat like this I'm looking around two brothers like oh we're gonna sink we're gonna die I'm like Jesus help me and the guy just backed your home oh my god be shaking myself because I never been through that kind of storm before and I saw leaks in the boat I saw gasoline at the bottom of the boat it was an awful situation but I had no skill to remedy that situation but the man who been through that before he knew all about amen but jesus said it wasn't that way the disciples they tried everything they tried scooping out the water nothing was working they had no ability to help their situation never felt like that where you have no ability to make things get better I've done all I can do I'm afraid all I can do I've talked to all the people I can talk to I feel like there's nothing I can do and she's just saying praise the Lord he said wake me up the disciples had to get your spot where none of their skill could work for them brother have set head fear here set in when they've done all they could do to try to fix the situation they got scared but never said that's when we really get in trouble this when fear sets in he said do not fear what man is doing he said fear God for God is able to destroy both body and soul in hell goodness remember I read you the squad room I read - you're done program said some time not long ago some man give me a threat at a certain Sinan said if you don't get preaching divine healing in this city we're gonna throw a bomb on the platform because I read that to you this is in Cleveland Ohio which is pretty close you know brother man's response was I told that man I said the smoke won't dry so I'll be in glory I said that's all right he said why do we fear my if God be for you who can be against you you know it's written the Bible it's better than a millstone was hanging at your neck and drown the depths of the sea then to offend one of these that was even meeting man he said if you fight God can't fight stand still let God fight don't bring it to pass don't put every critic everything to shame he said let's settle down to faith in that glory let's let God fight ain't man see the disciples they're trying everything they can do this is I can figure out the numbers I can figure out the measurements this is all I can do and it's still failing turns out that mode we gotta believe God's Word and speak faith and let God take over the situation amen we're gonna fail war make mistakes we got that Christ fight the battles for put in his hands stop doubting he said the worst thing you can do is fear stop beer and you just believe amen glory the Prophet said when there's no remedy he said we must remember that now they are the sons of God the Bible said now you're the sons of God not future we are the sons of God when you're born again the Holy Ghost you are a son you are a daughter of God and you have authority the story you like this but I've know the story of the policeman he said you get a fresh policeman out of police academy he said you put a hat on him that goes around this here's the Hat stupid he said he's almost nervous put him out on the street and let him blow the whistle he said he don't have power to stop that 300 horsepower truck but he's got authority to stop it he said that's how we are we have no power we have no still we have no ability but we've got authority where we speak the name of Jesus amen hallelujah I love that story we don't have any probably might even feel like more fresh recruits many times I'd be like that I'm just a young pastor I'm just so young you know I'm just young all these things we might feel like that but the Bible said that we have authority to speak its name and the Bible says like a power we speak Jesus thing it's like we're running into the tower amen we are safe we're stable we've got victory we're protected in Christ amen glory he says this the Prophet said Jesus knew this trouble or storm was coming I like this this just encourages tonight remember they're not the revival mode anymore I'll be honest I'm not going to revive you mode right now wear this dress that was tired he said but jesus knew this storm was coming I mean oh jesus knew you're strong he may go through the storm the Prophet said the store was only given as a test of your faith the Prophet said maybe this revival has led up and now in the midst of the storm to see what we'll do about it the Prophet said it's only a test of baby Peter said the test of your faith is what more precious than gold brother I said these words he said these exact words oh that refiners fire amen to burn out all the doubt and unbelief praise God so what would the side was experienced and they were spirited experiencing a trial of faith why it would burn out all their unbelief it would when they saw Jesus come on the scene and do what he did they would be able to have faith the next time praise God this trial is burned out their fear burned out their unbelief burn out their doubt and that's why we go through trials many times church is Jesus is trying to test our faith to see what will do program said they are glorious to you the tests are glorious to you the swords of the waves are glorious to you praise God the intellectual giant to the attacks they should be glorious to us because they're going to produce the right kind of faith in our lives but when I said sickness is a test of baby to see what you will do about it that's exactly right the Prophet said the devil came down and he got into the wind he got into the storm he said it's just like when we let down the bars on our standards right let down the bars convince the goats get in right he said many times the world wins and trials happen because we let down on our standards with the Lord we don't live like we used to MIT programs that's like a natural woman this natural whirlwind this natural storm on the Sea of Galilee is a type of the spiritual world winds we go through when we let down the bars and we let the enemy come in we just obey the Word of God right all right almost done here almost done okay I got 14 minutes bracelet let's read it now he says the Prophet says the disciple should not have cared about the storm because they knew the creator was in the ship did you catch that they should not have cared can you think of anybody who was extremely calm in the midst of the store they're just all relaxed no problem you know make sure you're really scared when it's thunderstorm right and like me but you know for the most part I am until I get a sudden shock you know like until you're surprised like I'm not scare right here and see the Thunder out there but when I'm just driving awesome crap you know it's really close to me and I'm a little scared but as an adult let's say just as a gentle thunderstorm as adults we're not scared the midst of those storms many times because we've been through them before and that's what the Prophet said the disciple should have been because they saw the power of God the revival they should have been totally calm during the storm like I'll come out in the midst of it and all the rains falling down upon you and water's coming into the boat and be like Oh grace Lord we're doing fine here Christ alone I got water to my ankles two minutes later I got water to my knees hallelujah but John how are you doing sir brother Matthew god bless you sir you enjoyed the sword you joined the water that's what he says real faith can do that how many want more real faith in there my my hands up first in the midst of a trial I would have real faith where these things don't even bother me problems fusses discouragements unexpected losses of life or anything like that we wouldn't have such strong faith that these things won't even discourage us will be so encouraging if only we could do that how many believe we can do amen I believe we can do it like I said the time you're knocking that testimony Simon what Haven got hit there on the cheek Simon was this call cool as a cucumber they say because he'd already seen men die in front of them you see men fall off scaffoldings 30 40 feet feet and seeing God bring him back to life so in the midst of that little storms a little bit of blood Darren or whatever you know six inches in the midst of that it was so common and I appreciate that don't you appreciate that I appreciate faith that in the midst of the storm you can feel the calmness of the Holy Spirit the program said everything was alright he said the Creator is in the boat that we're sailing amen he said that because the creation has to obey the Creator amen he said the cycle should realize by we have all this water here but the one who made the waters of the ship this wind is blowing but the one who made the wind is in the ship with us glory and rhodium said see we might have sickness in our body but the one who made the body is in our body as well and he said our soul oh praise God he's in our spirit our human minds he knows our minds to believe all the Word of God and this body has to obey the one that made it hotter than Vanessa be a hero believe God's Word I like that he said be like David David says yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil [Applause] [Music] glory to God I'll fear no evil even death I'll fear only remember that that father is the happiest time of my life I'm two hours away from being the presence of Jesus Christ it's the happiest time of my life then program who said that David said again then David said in Psalms 139 he said though I make my bed in hell thou art with me amen are you see David is understanding to where there been a valley of death where I'm lower than that in hell in the grave no matter where I am God is with me I don't want God with them ain't now let me close this quote this last quote here will be finished by the grace of the Lord tonight calling Jesus on the scene 1963 never the one I this is you going Jesus was three months out of this in November but it's the same thought the promise that they had seen God scripture were vindicated by him at the campaign and so have we how many ever seen God's Word vindicated you believe God's Word and God backed his word I you pray God answered your prayer oh how loving Jesus is how merciful Jesus that's what brother has said about the disciples 18 God's were vindicated and he was not hard to be calling on the scene he was just laying there waiting for them to call what a beautiful thought it's not hard to call Jesus on the scene cos he's right there with you it wasn't hard for disciples to wake him up because he's laying right there right next to them and that's how it is for us aren't you glad Jesus's comes out of this he's just a prayer away for then he was a hard bread baby couple heart I'm not sure how deep the ship was I don't know if that was levels and the ship or not I don't know but he wasn't far away about man said it's not hard for us to call it Jesus on the scene either he said I wonder tonight if he just isn't laying right in your heart waiting for you to wake him up he said oh he said the people today say well now if we could only know and be assured that he's in the boat with us we hear them say oh this is that this is that but man folks points at his Bible he said this is that he said now this is what he said this is his word he his word are the same let his word identify it into it that's the way he said could prove that he was God because the works that God did getting him to do was done by him if I do not the works of my father then don't believe me see that's how it identified him and that's how it identifies you your works identify who you are if you're saying you're a Christian but never said the identification of a Christian must be worked in you if it's not working you there's something wrong these signs shall follow them that believe not maybe they will they will if we could only realize that he is here with us the same yesterday today and forever low up with you always I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'm with you to the end of the world I'll never leave you he said I was just looking up scriptures I wrote down here concerning him and how can we be sure we'll never leave us he says because it's written in his proven word he's not waiting for you to call him on the scene to be proved so let us go and await Christ in our lives Santu our feet by God's grace I just want you to I want to read that again if I can this will help me it's elbows mother have said now I'm sorry he's now waiting for you and I to call him on the scene he's waiting and that story Jesus was resting right you need the rest but now remember said Jesus is not sleeping on us he's not sleeping like when is Lydia gonna pray when is when his brother Jesse gonna pray I'm waiting on but he's not sleeping but brother Ram said like he's waiting there he's waiting when is when is Jesse good ask what is Malachi gonna ask me to come on the scene when is the case she's gonna ask me to come on the scene he's actually waiting like just anxious to answer your prayer don't you love that he's not sleeping on you he's not off on a vacation like the gods of bale sleeping he's waiting for us to call him on the scene is just call me on the scene let me come more into your life Jesse sister so-and-so brother song is up let me call me on to sing let me come on into my into your life I wanna I want to be woken I want this I want the power God then wake up in your life and I want to come into your life in that beautiful grass that how do you a Christ by believing his word they freeze upon the scene that's what brings on the scene faith then we can call on him to confirm his word and don't doubt don't fear he said don't do that just believe him as it's written and let it be done and God will prove to you that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen that's alright sir we're praying here tonight Church I don't know where you are tonight I don't know if you've had some giants or some giant battles this week already I know my life I'm just battling a giant load of stress and that's what I need to speak to tonight I did go way to go Christ in my life but whatever you're battling

pray for you have any file that I pray for your people or tonight they do for this striking word that we've heard tonight Lord God or we might be here in the seat or we might be in the midst of this seat here in Lord God no one raised their hand and said up in the midst of a mountaintop revival Lord I imagined we're all being tossed I imagine we all could look down at our in our boat and say mine the waters are rising the pressures coming on God may you help us to be just as confident in the midst of the storm as we weren't back when we're on the mountaintop what I remember just a few years ago I was just so full of faith and so full of confidence every time you're gonna do a miracle or just believing no matter our weather is going to be a miracle and the Lord Here I am Lord forgive me I should have the same faith I had back there just as the disciples should have had the same faith they had the campaign they should have had an in the midst of the storm and should have been just as calm in the midst of the storm that's when they were with Jesus in the revival lord help me God I pray Lord help your people let me pray for your people lord help your people if they find themselves in a boat that's really not fast it's covered in waste it's covered in doubt it's covered in giant discomfort and stress it's covered in fear the fear is rising the temptation is rising father in

let's pray for we can witness to him you get a chance at him and also to God bless us here and give you everybody here she has two witnesses somebody and before we pray though I may have to cancel second services for the wild Sunday because I'm just really tired it only happens a few times a year but I get really tired and I'm really kind of worn out and so just pray for me you can't by God's grace there's nothing wrong with that the bible does say though like this - my conviction we have to gather the more as we see that day approaching so if we're having like let's say we would just do away with second service all together well if we don't gather together more we're not keeping the scripture anymore so that's what I'm saying there's times of the season where I get so tired we met I may have to cancel for a few months or a month or two or so like that but we have to remember we need to gather more so we got to try to do that by God's grace nothing that can be special meetings you know that can be but we got to get more with the believers so that's how I in my life that's how I feel the best way I could group in that scripture knowledge that have to suddenly services there from time to time you know special mediums and things like that but just so you know I'm kind of feeling low in health I'd only get sick perhaps they've got don't expect us to do everything and that's a hard one because I know I don't want to do everything tomorrow we have 76 kids I know for Bob hookup 76 and last year was mostly I was 65 so I'm so excited now I got will preach tomorrow after school after working 8 hours I had that priest tomorrow for an hour so I need your help I need your prayers and I don't want to wear myself out I've only hit sick I don't lose my voice to being like a few years what else preaching that yes no I don't wanna do that I don't lose my voice so I gotta use wisdom it's a busy time and season in my life I'm happy court but I just want to say that before we pray let's pray for the doors to be opened oh and I also have a Bible study on Sunday at 3:30 no I'm Saturday at 3:30 with one of the boys from Bible club who wants to be baptized so I'm going into his house and I'm gonna share the water baptism named Lord Jesus Christ and he's her fourth grade now is a 4th grader now names Andrew so pray for him and his sister a teenager she's name's Callie she's a freshman I think her sophomore and she wants to be baptized and anymore Jesus Christ hey you think they don't receive the message of their save church that's another one that's another crown that's another jewel in God's crown so I'm really excited for that so please pray for me and just look pretty now I may cancel a second service leading towards the right now but I want to pray about it first I may have to cancel for all of September something like that my brother um Brian Hawkins is coming on September 24th ok I just reached one service while I'm in New York I got traveling in September - that would be extra times I might want to rest up before then but hope you know I'm not trying to give the Lord less service I just realized I'm starting to get weak I need to take care of my body by God's grace so let's just pray if this is our heads please pray for me if you would this week I'll pray for you too how many Father we're living by faith in Jesus above trusting and confiding in your great love thank you that you're in our ship Lord God you were in this ship Lord God tonight thank you that you're right here in this church thank you that you're right here in our souls you're in our ship Lord God like Paul said no man will lose his life if he just remains in this help us Lord God to stay in the phone to stay in the church to stay faithful to you more with all our hearts and souls Lord God Lord I pray you'd open up a Bible study with my friend Ken Lord God he's dunking me now an orca father picked his heart I asked North God we prayed when he was in a three-week-long coma and you brought him out of the coma back to work father no let me get a chance to talk about a soul again dear God please change his heart Lord Jesus I'll remember this prayer will God bless our Bible study on Saturday and company that this fourth grader and freshman Lord God or green freshmen we want to be baptized buried in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I've asked you before Lord for a family from Copley to come into the message I see again more than knew your will I really think that'd be a great vindication to me of how I supposed to be a teacher company and past at the same time the Lord even if this family doesn't want to spray their hearts would open up to justification it's such a great work you're probably said if Luthor's can live justification they'd be such a credit to the kingdom of God help this family Lord could be a credit to the kingdom of God so they have all that they know in justification Lord and I just pray that one of these families come into the message you come into our church Lord God I prayed that before on this altar I cried on this altar praying that and I know you're here my prayer I'm gonna keep believing it I'm gonna keep feeding for souls Lord father's time to work we can only work while we're alive on this earth once we pass away there'll be no more work we can do after that help us to work and labor while we're here probably but I see Satan's give them an opportunity witness to some Souls invite them to church maybe family members or God use those that are here tonight less those hungry hearts that's those on your hearts in our livestream enlarge Jesus we're so privileged that you're in our or god help us to exercise our faith wake you up so we can be calm in the midst of our storm tonight whatever we're going through or Jesus we thank you for it it's been so good to me in your house and I'm leaving a better Christian everyone else's Lord by your grace adversity go with us now as we worship you in Jesus Christ's name the church that church you're going through that mission to our question of the week that's the week of the Lord what a beautiful name what a beautiful
