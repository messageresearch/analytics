========================================

the grace of God let's go to Romans 4 22. we'll start there Grace actually let's go up a few verses because we kind of ended on this on Sunday we go up to um I'll start at verse 17 and then we can all read 21 together so I'll read 17 down to 20 myself and then we can all read 21. the Bible says add as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the Dead and called calleth those things which be not as though they were so that's what Abraham did he would call the things that were not as though they were because God told him to right that's where brother Brown teaches us remember on the third poll I showed you yes brother Ram brother bran can you speak us into the condition for the Rapture mother Ram said only if God tells me to he said I never asked to speak any of those things God told me to speak those things right so same thing with Abraham same thing with us whatever God tells us to speak that's what we speak praise God that's what we believe Verse 18 who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God let's read verse 21 ready one two three and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform amen let's have one more word of prayer if you haven't eaten on your heart Let's Make a known unto God Heavenly Father we thank you God for the word of God we've read we thank you for these songs God this is who you are you love us and this is what you do you save us Lord God what a great summary of of your person Lord God so we thank you we give you praise we give you honor and Glory it's a joy to be in your house it's wonderful to sing these songs God our faith is rising Lord even as we we pray here tonight Lord God I pray Lord your Holy Spirit would speak through me Lord and hear through each one of us including me Lord God let my faith be increase Lord God and each one of us Lord God to have faith that's stronger as we uh hear the word of God and ultimately when we leave this place our faith will be stronger we'll keep giving you praise just like the Bible said about Abraham we'd be strong in faith giving you the glory so father God anoint me here tonight God just direct me by the Holy Spirit and I pray God that your will would be done tonight in Jesus Christ's name in the Saint said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God I want to continue on this here I do have some slides here by God's grace I will put those up there I think what I'll do is I'll go back to that chart I think I'll finish on that chart just uh briefly review that again that was such a help to a couple people so I want to review that uh and sorry again it's so blur I didn't I was off on my anniversary trip I didn't have a chance to study much that's okay I was relaxing by God's grace but I like to at one point make this real clear I just want to rehearse this again uh Abraham was called at 75 I don't know why it says 70 there I have to look it up I thought it was 75. maybe we got some Bible homework we got to do tonight by God's grace he's called at 75 that types a justification right you're called by God yeah even though we get saved we make some partial Disobedience decisions right but we're still saved and God and Abraham was righteous right there when God called him okay and then the next thing he does he gets a covenant you know through God and then he uh the famine comes he leaves the perfect will of God he gets in the permissive will of God but God's still with him God still favors him he had more favor than Pharaoh right even though it was Abraham's fault God still favored Abraham even though it was his fault praise God and God was on God was really on Abraham's side amen because he was the chosen man well then he comes back he gets back in the perfect will of God he rescues lot he saves the soul can I say like that he saved the soul many Souls actually naturally and then he meets God himself uh he meets Melchizedek and shortly after that then God visits him we read over the the Covenant on Sunday a beautiful type where he sees the Abraham sees the the awfulness of hell right but then God puts him to sleep and says you have nothing to do with this Covenant I'm making this Covenant I'm going to bring this to pass I'm confirming my Covenant I'm going to stand in the middle of these sacrifices and I'm confirming this Covenant I'm keeping this Covenant how many know that Jesus is going to keep his Covenant with you praise God you can trust and just just like Abraham is Covenant you can trust in the Covenant of Jesus Christ because it's the blood of his Covenant praise God it's a New Covenant in my blood Jesus said Hallelujah and so we see after that then of course uh uh Abraham has to wait a few years he gets a little impatient he lets Sarah talk him into having another wife a concubine and he gets out of the out of the will of God so interesting right after two look at that two spiritual experiences he meets Melchizedek and then he gets a vision from God after two amazing experiences with God then he disobeys God he tries to make God's word come to pass so see we've got to be careful once we have experience we've got to make sure we don't try to make something come to pass we've got to keep waiting on God keep being patient right okay but after that then God visits him and brings the Covenant of circumcision which is a type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost now what I left out of there was lot uh how he separated from lot now wasn't that something I preached on that and we had some guests that needed to hear that wasn't that something I wasn't even playing that that was God Discerning the thoughts and Tents of their hearts I believe that by God's grace see we got a choice we can choose to live with the world and live a semi-christian life right with among sodomites or we can come out and be like Abraham and his seed praise God and we can travel with with uh the few right the rejected few we can travel with them and we can be separated from the things of the world uh and live a high calling of God in Christ Jesus I'm glad to live with Abraham's seed praise God hallelujah that's where I want to live by God's grace so then he gets the seal the Holy Ghost but he even laughs at God he even lasted God like oh God that's a good one uh it's not going to come I don't I don't believe it can come through Sarah that's what he was laughing about but then God convinced him in the next chapter God visits him in a flesh body with two angels and that's a type of brother Ram's ministry right we believe that because he was uh God gave the sign the Messiah sign Discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart the same sign Jesus did in John chapter 1 and John chapter four like when I preached on when the Junction City saints were here brother brand new the thoughts and Tents of people's hearts through the gift of the Holy Spirit all right uh and then what we we ended with on Sunday was that Abraham now believes God Abraham's not laughing at God but Sarah's laughing at God but God still didn't get rid of Sarah God didn't get rid of either of them because both of them are in the same situation both of them were laughing out both of them were laughing at God's promise unless God helped them believe so it doesn't matter if you're male or female right doesn't matter what you are we're all going to laugh at God's promise we're all going to doubt it until God proves it to us praise God right where in other words we're all going to need God's help to believe God's word hallelujah and if you're in the plan of God God is going to bring he's going to bring you to a place where you can believe his promises that's how it was in every generation in other words God got Enoch ready to believe for the Rapture God got Noah ready to believe for the flood right God got uh uh Moses ready to take two million people out of Egypt to defeat the greatest army there was in the world God always has to get us ready to do anything praise God so if we live to see the Rapture God's going to get us ready for the Rapture praise God because we believe it we believe in the same God that did all those other Mighty works the same God is here today Hallelujah amen he'll get us ready praise God and then remember in 18 also we didn't get to that but but uh Abraham was interceding for lot please don't destroy Sodom because Lots down in there now George that's what we've come to many many uh even brother Diggs when he was here he and I were talking in fellowship and as we talked he brought that up he's like our duty is to pray for the foolish version I said that's exactly right that's what I believe see so we got to remember our family members right we've got to keep praying for our families our friends our co-workers right we got to keep praying for them because that's the ministry of Abraham Abraham doesn't want to see anybody lost can I say like this Abraham don't want to see anybody uh uh go through the tribulation period right he knows they're going to but he doesn't want to see anybody suffer the wrath of God so we've got to keep praying we can't give up on prayer we got to be prayer warriors amen hallelujah I'll say this you have at least three chances to be a prayer Warrior every time we have service praise God you can bow your head in prayer you can get on your knees in prayer you can stand and pray however you want to pray just pray praise God Amen because that's our calling that's our ministry that was Abraham's Ministry I'm interceding so people aren't lost I'm interceding so God will spare the righteous and that's what we're supposed to do praise God amen I forgot I want to pray for the government too tonight I forgot to pray for that but I have to pray for that after service and then church you know the story uh God you know two angels went down there to Sodom and they pulled out a lot that was in Genesis 19 and uh and then of course God sends fire and brimstone down and destroys it destroys the sodomites uh and the Bible said in the book of Jude that's God's example what he's going to do at the end time he's going to again destroy the world by fire just like he destroyed Sodom by fire and brimstone right that's how he's going to deal with homosexuality and then chapter 20 was remember Abraham uh lied to abimelech the Philistine King so verse he lied to the Egyptian king now he lies to the Philistine King about his beautiful 99 year old wife well I'm sorry she would have been 89 year old wife sorry this beautiful 89 year old woman he wanted to take for his wife and brother man tells us you got to read between the lines and you see God was already changing her back to a young woman Hallelujah so she so the next chapter she could bring forth Isaac right in chapter 21 right because Isaac's born in chapter 21. but here we still see Abraham lying in Genesis chapter 20. my wife brought out a good point too remember in Genesis uh Genesis 18 Sarah lied to God so what do we see in their strain in their family what do they struggle with honesty right have you ever seen a strain in your family like my family really struggles with so and so like I just had a preacher tell me today saying I just had a preacher tell me today their family struggles with murder and they've had they've had four murders over the last few few years a number of years poor murders and they know that's the strain in their family anger and violence violence and murder and this brother is in the message now he's he's free of it he's a real man of God but there's people in his family that they're not saved so they murder that's a strain thank God that's not in our families but there are strains in our families look at so what was Abraham's problem lion dishonesty honesty if we're all honest with to be honest we've all got to strain in our family brother Brown was critic I mean critical spirit right he always battle a critical spirit that's what he told us and then he also told us he was a people pleaser he told us that numerous times he didn't want to hurt people's feelings many times he'd preach hard but sometimes he wouldn't he said he didn't like to hurt people's feelings I got this quotes I mean so sometimes he's a little too soft right didn't tell the truth maybe you didn't didn't I shouldn't say that uh didn't uh uh didn't uh maybe correct people when he could have corrected them I made a better way to say that right and of course we know he lied to the IRS so that's maybe something in his family there but I'm just trying to bring out the point I thought that was a good point my wife brought out now look Abraham had lied and then his wife lies and then if you keep reading Abraham lies again if you keep reading Isaac lies about Rebecca being his wife so see how there's strains in our families now who's the who how many here are going to overcome the strains in your family you will because you're Abraham's seed hey amen hallelujah maybe like my family was uh cigarette addiction and an alcoholism and other things you know kind of runs in my my mom's side you know just addictions like that how about uh we talk about anger how about lust running in families how about greed people that their families are all about money see where none of us are exempt from those family strains but all of us have power to overcome hey man that's why you're here tonight praise God Amen because you know there's power in the word of God hallelujah there's power to forgive like our sister testified about amen there's peace that passes all understanding amen Lord remember these are all after he's in tight got the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Seal of God see how you can lie even after you're born again that means you could lust that means you could have greed you could uh be critical you could have complexes even after having the baptism of the Holy Ghost so but getting the baptism the Holy Ghost doesn't solve all your problems it just gives you more power to overcome the problems amen hallelujah you said you'll be a witness you have power to be a witness unto me in Jerusalem and Judea and to the uttermost parts of the world praise God Amen now church that proves you know we had a church member years ago who left here and moved over to the Middle East and we thought I thought the person had the baptism the Holy Ghost but when the person got there eventually we found out they didn't because they didn't have power to be a witness they gave into sin and now they don't even believe the message anymore but see that's why the Holy Ghost is given so you have power to be a witness wherever you go praise God no matter where you go no matter what situation you're think about that Paul was in a prison but he still had power to be a witness Hallelujah amen that's what the Holy Ghost is for so you're a witness no matter what situation you're in your family you're a witness and you stand for Jesus Christ you don't give in to the world you don't give into a religious spirit you stand for Jesus Christ amen praise God okay kind of came to me there now so that was uh chapter 21 20 he lies the bimlich but he gets Sarah back again twice same mistake twice uh and then in chapter 21 Isaac's born Ishmael gets cast out and then the chapter 22 Abraham has this is called to sacrifice Isaac the very thing he loved the most he was called to give up in order to obey God but of course God doesn't believe in human sacrifice other than his son right this was a type of that right the type of that okay and then we see in chapter 20 uh or the death of Sarah in 23 and then Abraham gets another wife in 24 and then I'm certainly gets a wife for Isaac and then he gets another wife Katura in 25 then he passes away at the end of 25 there so just just uh interesting thought there again after he gets the baptism Holy Ghost he has some really severe battles he's got a he can be a prayer Warrior after he's got the seal circumcision amen he intercedes for other people praise God he can really pray Hallelujah yeah you can really pray for the foolish virgin can I say like that because he's got the seal now got sealed Hallelujah uh he can he can have a body change now amen glory the Rapture amen he can have faith he can have faith to sacrifice anything to put God first now Church many times just like in that story it's going to be family members and relationships that we got to sacrifice in order in order to put God first and I don't mean many now sometimes you may have to give up a relationship completely if the person's pulling you down I'm not talking about marriage we're married till death I'm talking about friendships you may have to give up friendships or certain things in order to put God first like always remember this one preacher told me he said he had he was preaching and he had a friend and the friend was a preacher too but this friend would always call him and take up all of his time and it was like a competition the other preacher was trying to get thoughts from him and and have more thoughts and Revelations uh and it really just messed up their friendship but once once they moved apart and once they separated they both got married then they didn't have that competitive spear anymore imagine that preacher is competing who's got the better sermons who's got the better Revelations let's not have that praise God right right but but that can happen people can compete over anything well who had the better song special right or who's the better preacher who's the better who cooks the better food for the carrians who's more generous who dresses more holy who's got fancier clothes anything it's a competitive spirit and see so God that's a good example of you got to choose God you got to see if this is hurting me something's got to be done I either got to approach them I got to talk to them I got to repent to them whatever you got to do but you got to put God you got to obey God first praise God amen and so we see again Abraham here he was a type for you and I praise God a type for you and I I think I'll stop right there by God's grace now I want to go back here let's pick up your Bibles we've got your Bibles here so we are still in this uh second section it's really the third but we went through the introduction we saw how the whole world I just don't fix that was guilty before God the whole hole the hole of the whole was guilty before God now we're in the par of what's the solution to this problem everybody's guilty the solution is justification by faith is a solution and who's who's the example we're going to use how do we get saved brother Austin Abraham's our example hallelujah sister who's our example Abraham we're all Sinners we all deserve hell we've all fallen short of the glory of God if you're a moralist that doesn't save you if you're Heathen a savior if you're a Jew it doesn't save you what saves you faith in the word of God believing God's word alone is what saves you praise God that's the solution believe God don't trust in your ability to get saved trust in Jesus's ability to save you amen hallelujah praise God now eventually we'll get to this here uh this the second this third part rather we'll get to the believer's walk in the Holy Spirit which I've been preaching that over the years you know with Romans 8 these last few years just the promises of God but uh we'll see kind of how the Lord brings us through there now I want to read this I didn't get to read this on Sunday I felt like I should stop I think I preached an hour and a half on Sunday so I stopped there and I felt I felt a good time to pray I felt like the faith was at its highest right there and so we prayed for our brother Austin that was a real good testimony brother random said the Bible said Abraham stagger not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving praise to God his name was changed from Abram to Abraham the changing in the name made his name father of Nations can you imagine a man living with his wife his sweetheart that'll live with her now for all these years Abraham was 99. right and she was 89. and they still had no children right and yet the God said you're the father of many nations I've got no kids right that's what that's what he says he says and his wife 70 years old and yet without one child or any hope of a child yet claim that he was the father of a Nation can you imagine the criticism of his passing fellow man would say father of Nations now how many children do you have at this time and all the criticism he had to go through with see church when God asks us to believe his word he's also going to allow us to be tested to see if we really believe it praise God in other words you're going to face some criticism why do you dress like that why don't you watch that anymore why what happened why you used to act like this you used to say this you said listen to that why don't you listen to that anymore you're going to get criticized oh you're holy I just heard you make a mistake or you just treated me mean last week you're gonna get criticized you've got to expect that and you've got to be able to rebound from your mistakes and get back to trusting in the promises of God hallelujah Abraham could have dwelt on the fact well I haven't I don't have the promise I don't know the promise I must be a failure God must not love me God God's word must not be true but he had to focus on God's promises true praise God he had to choose because he's getting made farther brother said they laugh and say oh father of Nations father Nations where's all your seed Abraham they'd make fun of him oh God told you that why hasn't happened yet it's been 24 years they would just make fun of him but he had to go through the criticism in order to be an overcomer praise God we've got to go through criticism in order to overcome today as well praise God Amen but Abraham didn't stagger anywhere at all of unbelief he believed that God was able to perform that which he had promised that God would prove his word no matter how long it took how many believe that see that's what we got to be so convinced I don't care how long it takes God is going to perform his word in my life ah I'm willing to wait as long as I have to wait because I know God proves his word amen but instead of getting weaker each time like we are prone to do he got stronger all the time now church we saw sometimes he got weak right sometimes he laughed and then other times he gets stronger But as time went on overall he got stronger so that's what we need God's grace Lord make me stronger today don't let me leave this service weaker let me leave this service stronger in the promise of God amen like brother man said let me doubt my doubts amen but man said if you if you don't have it uh if you don't care enough about the word of God brother man I said Lord created me a care so I care more about the word of God I want to doubt my doubts and created me whatever I need of creating me the faith created me the strength as we said on Sunday the Bible said in Hebrews 11 Sarah received strength in other words Lord send your strength today and I'll receive it praise God ah Hallelujah amen Abraham said if it didn't happen today tomorrow it'll be a greater Miracle because it's one day older how many people saying that today praise God if God doesn't do my miracle today it's going to be even greater tomorrow it's gonna be a greater testimony praise God if it doesn't happen this year when it happens next year it's going to be even greater praise God yeah more people to tell the testimony to because it went on longer it went on more years and that will encourage them to keep believing over the years oh Hallelujah thank God like I can tell that testimony because I was connected to the 17 Amish people getting baptized now I can share that testimony the man waited 18 years to see a church receive the message and I was part of that I played a part in that and I I just was part of that Vision I was part of that prayer and so now I can share I can share this keep praying if you want your family saved keep praying praise God at least for 18 years amen right and we would say at least probably 25 years because Abraham waited 25 years for Isaac amen Glory amen Hallelujah it's gonna be a greater testimony tomorrow if it happens tomorrow that was God and that was God in Abraham so see church when you are speaking God's word that's God speaking in you how many will let God borrow your vocal cords Hallelujah so you'll be the one that's speaking God's word hallelujah amen for he know that God proved all of his words to be so Oh Glory if his children will only take his word so he can prove it by you that's the only way he can prove his word is if you believe it he doesn't prove it to unbelievers they can't be proved they're unbelievers but it's not to unbelievers it's not for unbelievers it's to him that believes and if you can find somebody who will believe his word he will prove his word by you and sometimes sickness and things happen to us that way that God can prove himself so our sicknesses or our our troubles in general are just so that God can prove his word to us praise God the reason we have troubles is so God can prove I can deliver you from trouble praise God oh thank God may God help us to see our trials like that praise God God lets us go through difficult times to prove that he can bring us through difficult times Hallelujah Amen in other words God let me get coveted a couple years three years ago so I could overcome covet and now I got a testimony right just like anyone who else who had covered and you overcame it right it killed millions of people but if you overcome it's God allowed it so you would have a testimony praise God amen he said you remember what the blind man that Jesus found they said who sin he his father or his mother he said in this case neither but that the works of God might be made known see it happened to that voice that Jesus could be glorified oh sometimes sickness is not a curse it's a blessing oh I'm gonna read that one again because I didn't hear any amends on that one maybe I didn't slow down long enough let me slow down this time he says sometimes sickness is not a curse it's a blessing that's hard to amen isn't it sometimes it's hard for me to amen even amen sometimes sickness is a blessing in other words I'm saying this blindness was a blessing because Jesus healed him and it brought Jesus Glory Hallelujah so see sometimes sickness or trouble is not God's curse in me you see God's curse I mean God and the whole time God's like I'm trying to use you for my glory you're like God why am I so cursed why am I so cursed God's like you're blessed I'm just I'm just trying to get glory in your life I'm trying to bless you you're like why'd you curse me God's like I'm trying to bless you speak my word right church right we can't be cursed we're already blessed amen the blood of Jesus Christ has forgiven us it saved us it's already set us in the Heavenly place of church you and I are already accepted in heaven the Bible says we are accepted already in the Beloved amen in other words when you when you pray and you go to heaven and you're I'm sorry your faith goes up to heaven you and you interact with God in the conversation he's already accepted you he's already said come on in come on in and talk to me I'd like to talk to you we'll get to that in chapter five the Bible says we are already welcome to come in we already have access to Heaven praise God so trials are not your curse trials are you're blessed believe my word oh my God thank God why so that we can stick our faith out there and call those things like Austin's been doing call those things which are not as though they were also been sending me some encouraging texts this week right brother God said so and it'll prove it so if you're just not weakened under the test now Church don't get discouraged if we weaken another test because Abraham weaken under the test Sarah weakened under the test but what happened they never quit on God they never quit on God in other words they just kept giving God glory amen they just kept repenting and getting right with God Amen they just kept waiting on God they kept serving God look they never sold out God said we'll move down to Sodom with them sodomites we might as well I haven't got my promise yet I'm gonna move back down to the side I'll just might as well go with lot I haven't gotten my promise yet that's not what Abraham and Sarah did they just stay true to God they just stay faithful to God and Abraham just sat under that oak tree and he was just waiting for God he was looking for God and then God come and then he runs out to him remember that amen but you're here you're sitting here under the oak tree right of God's presence and just waiting for God to come and church when God comes let's run out to meet him praise God in other words when we feel God's spirit when we feel the word of God is speaking to us let's agree with it let's confess it and let's speak God's word let's give God praise for his word amen amen now look he puts and I put some other examples God proved his word through Abraham and Sarah now he could prove to job one time that he wouldn't curse him to his face he proved job will never curse me to my face look at the trial that Joe went through but down the very jaws of death yet he said the lord gave and the Lord take it away blessed be the name of the Lord he certainly believed it God proved his word to job he proves to Abraham he proved it so how many understand that God's trying to prove his word to you but you we got to believe it praise God no let's get back in our Bibles here uh Romans that was kind of like the warm-up there I never I didn't I didn't get that on Sunday that's the warm up there by God's grace verse 20 22. yeah I actually left off 22. and therefore was reputed unto him for righteousness in other words so Abraham was fully persuaded what God promised he performed and therefore God imputed righteousness to him so in other words God God will see us as righteous when we fully believe his promise and I'm just talking about being saved I'm just talking about salvation right well if you raise your hand and you've got the helmet of salvation on praise God thank you for putting on your armor today praise God you ought to because you're in a big fight if you don't put it on you're gonna get hit up by the head and start wondering whether I'm saved or not praise God let's have our armor on praise God let's believe that we're saved Hallelujah verse 23 now it was not written for his sake alone thou it is imputed to him in other words all these scriptures weren't written just for Abraham they're written for us but for us also to whom I shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our lord from the dead how many believe Jesus alive today he's not dead He's Alive I believe that he's actually here tonight praise God Amen he just healed Austin on Sunday he's here praise God amen who was delivered for our offenses so Jesus was delivered and crucified because of what we did and was raised again again for our justification so he was crucified for us and he was raised for us my the whole thing was for us praise God right God wrote about Abraham for our sake that we might believe in our justification and all the other Divine Promises of God now George I always want to bring this to your remembrance you have all Divine blessings and you have all Divine promises that's what the Bible says we've been blessed with how many all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places praise God so whatever we have need of tonight we have access to it if we believe it right we're talking about overcoming greed and overcoming lies like Abraham had to overcome his lies or overcoming lust or overcoming anger or violence or murder whatever we got to overcome we have access to the power to overcome it praise God because we've got all spiritual blessings amen like that song we sang a while ago bless me Lord oh bless me Lord bless me Lord oh bless me Lord that's what we're talking about Lord bless me with all your blessings praise God Hallelujah and church whatever the blessings we have need of we can go to God and say your word says I'm given all spiritual blessings now notice that wasn't all natural blessings right it wasn't all natural it was all spiritual blessings right I know inflation is really tough right now but but God didn't always always promise to give us so much natural blessings right although we we trust God for all the blessings and all of our provision but he says all spiritual blessings and then Peter remember says his divine power has given us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that called us to glory and virtue so whatever you need to live this life the spiritual life and to be like God it's already given to us but how do we possess it whereby our given on us exceeding great and precious promises that by these promises you might be partakers of the divine nature right having escaped the corruption that's in the world through lust so how do you inherit all the spiritual blessings and life and godliness through a promise so church when we need something we've got to find like even like with cisronia's testimony she needed healing or she needed relief from that right and so she knows it's in the Bible I'm sure she at some point thought of this that that blessing is somewhere in the Bible and all she had to do is just find that promise and believe that promise now that applies to each and every one of us praise God whatever spiritual blessing we need we just got to find the Bible say Lord you promised Hallelujah and I'm going to be like Abraham I'll be like Sarah I'm going to give you praise until I receive the promise hallelujah thank God Amen thank you Jesus like I'll just say like this like if uh if someone was scared to dance like we did on Sunday or someone's scared to worship or stand up and praise God Dave just got to quote the promise where the Bible says uh where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty that's a promise so if they're afraid they just got to say Lord when your spirit's there help me to have the liberty of the spirit you promised it and then you can use that promise where the Bible says the sons of God are led by the spirit of God in other words I'm a Child of God say Lord I'm a Child of God lead me to dance or lead me to shout or leave me to prophesy or whatever you're calling me to lead me to speak in tongues just leave me because I want the freedom I want the liberty of the Holy Spirit praise God Amen thank God Hallelujah praise God that's wonderful so see Church whatever promise we have need of we got to find that in the Bible and quote it like Abraham and Sarah and keep glorifying God until you get it Hallelujah that's why as we've learned with some of the saints that come and go that's why we've learned when we're tired and when we're tired and sick and discouraged that's not the time to miss church that's the time to come to church that's because that because at some point during the service the Holy Spirit Will prompt you to give me praise he'll say give me praise worship your hands now you can be like Abraham and Sarah and now you can be strong in faith giving God glory call those things that are not as though they are and let God's spirit flow through you keep praising God until you receive the promise of God oh my that's wonderful how many times have I seen at church especially during the school year I work all day I get up at 5 a.m many times I got headaches because I don't sleep enough maybe during the school year today I don't have a headache thank God but there's many times church I feel like calling off church I should say many times there's a few times I feel sick I've got a headache I've got a sore throat I don't feel like coming to church sometimes and I'll get a little Whisper of the Satan he'll say you can cancel church you're the pastor thank God I've never gave into that and when I think I had to do it one time I think yeah at one time I think I had to do that I told bang or to play a tape or something like that years and years ago but I have the choice every service I could cancel church or I could come to church and be strong in faith and give God glory well you know what I choose most the time I never forget that one time I had to I was preaching on dancing and I had a headache the whole service and then I started dancing and praising God by the end of it the headache was gone amen show me keep giving us God won't heal every time right sometimes I preach right through sickness I'm still sick at the end but God gives us such encouragement just believe his word just keep confessing his promise let's be like Abraham and Sarah let's keep believing God until it happens praise God ah let's show that we got faith for every spiritual blessing we got faith for God's Divine Promises of life and godliness through believing God's word just believe God's word hallelujah hahaha and I just thought I'd read this I love this quote I heard this I read this the other day I thought well I think the Saints will just like this quote it's a really nice quote works is Faith Express notice the Holy Faith of of God was United with the Holy works of his prophet remember God's Holy Faith was revealed to Abraham what was God's Holy Faith you're going to have a son through Sarah so that was a Holy Faith or a holy promise of God right he received it and by there he started with his holy works by believing the seed of Promise had a place to grow so you've got to we gotta we got to recognize any promise we want from God is like a seed and we got to plant that in our hearts and the way you water is by saying thank you Lord thank you Lord this is going to come to pass I received that Hallelujah so so so so uh so we could take a promise day and say Lord uh you said go into all the world and preach the gospel he that believeth is baptized shall be saved so we can say Lord I'm taking that promise I went to you sent me to Akron I'm here preaching I'm going to see so saved that's a promise of God and church as we've gone on in time a few Souls have got saved praise God it's more souls that God saved is than if we would have quit and said well I believe God for five years and I haven't seen a soul save that's not the time to quit that's the time to say the Miracles right around the corner praise God it's going to happen any time now let's believe God's word let's be strong in faith giving God glory praise God foreign you or something never give up keep believing God God wants to prove his word is true Hallelujah you're not cursed you're blessed hallelujah oh my thank God Hallelujah let's give God's word a place to grow right in here Jesus let your seed grow right in here for all of us it's Lord It's The Rapture or it's the baptism of holy ghost or its loved ones being saved let that promise grow up in your heart say thank you Lord I'm blessed this is This Promise This seed is going to receive water it's going to fall on good ground it's going to fall on an honest heart I'm going to keep praising you I'm going to keep worshiping you until I see the the seed bring forth of its own kind amen praise God hallelujah thank you Jesus so notice this notice what program says Grace sent the promise Abraham only had to believe and overcome his sins his life he had overcome his lust maybe with Hagar he had to overcome his lying to the two kings he had to overcome his own unbelief when he laughed at God and God's even talking to him he just had to keep believing God he just had to keep moving on with God so you you and I ought to feel very encouraged that we're here tonight we're just like Abraham despite our failures maybe Monday through Wednesday or maybe Thursday through Saturday right despite our failures we still come to church and you still give God praise ah God Amen God made sure or he helped Abraham believe the promises God's going to make sure that you believe the promise that's exactly right now Church Jesus I just want to make this very very simple you say you might say brother Jester you might say sister so-and-so how do I do this how do I how do I make this happen there's one word to answer for you believe well just how do I heal the sicker how do I cast out devils which I don't see it as much as I used to you know thank God there's less people filled with the Devils around around me by God's grace I'm thankful for that but how do I do Miracles or how do I live a Godly life believe ah they asked Jesus what shall we do Jesus that we might work the works of God I'm a Believer I would do God's Works how do I do it Jesus he answered and said to them this is the work of God that you believe on whom he has set praise God I want to do something for God today I don't even want to do work God's works just believe Jesus Hallelujah don't believe the world don't believe social media right don't believe the media I don't believe family members if they disagree with Jesus just believe Jesus Hallelujah amen isn't that beautiful and that what is that this is Faith right belief is the same as Faith just have faith just believe God's promise and you can do the works of God I'm the one to hear that I think that served God the longest since 1999 I think so so I can tell you after 25 years 24 years of serving Jesus it really boils down to one thing just believe Jesus Hallelujah no matter where the trials I've been through no matter the tests I've been through I've found there's one thing I can do to overcome that's believe just believe God's word how many are believers tonight by God's grace oh I know you are amen now this reminded me of the five sermons that brother random preached called convinced then concerned once you believe God's word then you're concerned about what God is doing right like for the example I'll keep going back to this one that God answered the Roe versus Wade which we're coming up on the one year anniversary of that hallelujah amen thousands of babies have been saved because of that but I first had to be convinced and this is something that most message people don't do they don't pray for the government and laws to change they just want to go if I'm the last seed and go home they don't pray for sin to be removed in fact one of the uh the one of the leaders of Branham Tabernacle said uh get let the next president be the homosexual guy so he can lead the world into destruction and we'll all go to heaven the Rapture like he's actually praying for homosexuals to be the leaders the Bible never says that Jesus said don't give up until I come he said occupy until I come amen but see first I had to be convinced that God would actually care to change the law about uh about abortion and once I was convinced I actually found it by reading about American history through wall builders they she uh that wall Builders Guy what's his name David Barton thank you you're my second you're my third memory second memory David Martin used all these scriptures where and he used all this history of American presidents praying for God to move and God moved for them and if they're using they use the Bible and they saw God intercede in biotics make intercession in politics well he isn't Jesus Christ the same yesterday to him forever Hallelujah and so once I was convinced that that God does care about politics then I became concerned then I would spend time sister who prayed at this altar amen you saw it praise God my wife and the family saw it that's why I pray for all those years and then God changed the law because I got convinced I believed and then I got concerned praise God oh you can apply that to anything in your life first you got to be convinced what does God want you to do what is God's will once you know God's will you're convinced then you can be concerned about it praise God amen you got to be convinced it's God's will or it's God's desire for your life then you get concerned about it amen I like what brother man says now Andrew this is in John chapter one Andrew became very very concerned because he stayed with Jesus all night and was convinced and then when he become convinced that he was the Christ that he was concerned about somebody else now this is what brother Austin's been doing lately he's so convinced the message is right he's inviting people to church at his job right brother Austin don't we love that about our brother now church not everybody's called to be an Andrew Letterman said some people are prayer warriors they're not Soul winners some people are prayer Wars otherwise other people are fire Brands to preach right so we don't have to be all like Austin or Simon is a good witnessing machine and invites people to church all the time you just have to do you just have to believe amen I'll say that you just got to believe amen and you'll do the works of God hallelujah brother Madison I believe every man or woman every boy or girl that ever stays long enough that you're convinced it is right and it is the Holy Ghost you are burdened so hard in your heart you can't stand still and let these people die like this and shame and sin it'll grind the very heart out of you to get out here on these streets it does any Christian to see the people wholly given over to sin drinking gambling cursing swearing smoking now Brotherhood says this which is true it's true for all those people who are supposed to go witness on the streets but I never find brother Brown witnessing on the streets right listen to his ministry never talks about going out witnessing on the streets he says some people are called to do it but he never himself did that because he was praying for the sick right he's preaching behind the pulpit but somebody's going to be so burdened once they're convinced God's in it then they're going to be concerned about the Lost now see we don't ought to go out in the streets but we should all have prayer lives like Abraham ah amen and pray for people to be saved we should all have that desire once we're convinced that people could go to hell we got to be concerned to get them saved praise God amen so that's that's what I like I like brother Ram said uh or Jesus said just believe and then Brothers says once you're convinced once you believe something then you get concerned about other things other people all right now it's eight o'clock here let me go 15 minutes I'll set a timer right here I told my wife and I told my family a long time ago somebody needs to get a white flag back there and wave surrender once I once I I hit my limit okay say brother you said surrender you said you'd be done after 50 minutes okay so I Surrender okay I'll let God's people go you ever hear that joke the preacher said he said the the long way that he was from uh Mercy from Virginia and uh he was the pastor was kind of complaining about a guest preacher who was preaching long and he said he told him after service he said preacher he said you're just like Pharaoh he's like what do you mean I'm preaching the gospel he said you wouldn't let God's people go of course he was joking but that's a pretty rude joke now if you're now I know most people do it and it's led by the Holy Spirit but I do know a few that have held people for hours and they're LED they're not led by the Holy Spirit right we've seen that at another church last year we've seen that I've seen it I talked to some friends about it the man was trying to make a miracle happen and he failed the miracle didn't happen and then he blamed the whole church because America didn't happen that was not at this church it was at another church but that's an example where the man was like Pharaoh he didn't let the people go he was trying to bend in fact he was trying to vindicate that he was right and I was wrong it was about I was a part of it that's why I know about it because that's kind of related I actually preached on that a couple years ago I can tell you more about that if you like but all that to say give me 15 minutes all right Romans 5 verse one I'll be breaking this this we continue this section here therefore being justified by faith therefore means okay now that we've talked what's our conclusion we just went through we're all sinners we all deserve hell but like Abraham we become the righteousness of God amen therefore since we're like Abraham being justified by our simple Faith by just simply believing in Jesus Christ we have peace with God can we all say that let's all say I have peace with God can we I have peace with let's say it louder ready I have peace with now let's yell it ready I have peace with God Amen Hallelujah I memorized that verse about three years ago when I was struggling I was going through a season in my life and I memorized that that helped me so much I would quote that in the mornings I have peace with God and I overcame I don't struggle with that anymore I have peace with God most days I peace with God God has just showed me over and over again that he loves me now he may allow me to be tested like job he made malami tested like Daniel who knows but I just want to tell you I've grown to know that I have peace with God because of God's grace and I just believe with us that's all I do I just believe God's word I can't believe every promise I don't believe I don't bring every promise to pass in my life but I believe in Jesus Christ and that entitles me to peace with God just because I believe Hallelujah entitles you to peace with God just because you believe in other words I'm not fighting against God and church God's not fighting against you God's not fighting against you God's fighting for you remember your sicknesses are blessings Hallelujah the only case like sir and I we were and my wife were texting about communion the only time sickness is not a blessing is when you mistreat the body of Christ let's read that let's read that First Corinthians 11. remember this I preached this a couple years ago when I did that series on curses and blessings the only time sin or sickness would be a curse is if you you don't treat the body of Christ well you mistreat the Saints at church that's the only time sickness is a curse all right yeah verse 29. First Corinthians 11 29 for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily ease and drink a damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body that discernment means judge in other words when somebody doesn't take communion the right way they've judged somebody wrong in the church they treated somebody wrong in the church therefore they're under the curse of God the temporary curse of God and can you I'm sorry and let me read the next verse I'm sorry I'm not I got disconnected verse 30. for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep okay so when people are weak and sickly and die in the church it can be a curse if they mistreated other people that's what the Bible says now church I've said that before the book of Corinthians was a book of Acts Church it would start in the book of Acts and they had many people dying because they didn't treat each other the right way now I think I'm saying that to help us to be thankful be thankful that we have a healthy Church Hallelujah that's why I'm so glad God healed by the amen see people in the Corinthian Church weren't treating each other well so many of them were dying they had lots that happened at my mother's Church years ago some of the people spoke evil the message and then my brothers watched it and my wife my mom even told me many people died in that church in the next few years they had like 20 or 30 funerals in the next couple years right after they spoke evil about this message not to me that's not Discerning the bodybuilder that's my opinion but I believe that's what happened because the woman used thus saith the Lord against this message she said thus say the Lord serpent seeds of the devil and then her husband got sick and then they had 20 or 30 funerals in a couple years it's like death struck the church that's not Discerning the Lord's body so you know you know what I did sister Selena I went over to her house and I took her flowers Hallelujah because that's how you overcome evil with good she called my brother of the devil she called our beliefs of the devil so what do I do I'm gonna take you flowers you know oh yeah I gave him a 50 gift card I said here you take your wife out to eat you can curse me but I'm going to bless you because I choose the Jesus way you curse me I'll bless you Hallelujah kind of got off of that a little bit let's get back to the Romans so see sickness is going to be a blessing unless it's a curse because we've mistreated people in the body of Christ that's why church if somebody offends you go to them one-on-one Even in our church go to them one-on-one if texting is easier do texting or go to them face to face maybe after service or something like that let's treat each other and we do that's why I love this church that's why I love being a part of this church I'm glad to be a member here at the church because everybody treats each other with kindness and respect everybody forgives one another that's why I'm grateful to be a member of this church that's why I'm glad I go to this church and I don't go to the churches and I don't know if my wife my wife might agree with this but I'd say this of all the churches I ever attended I think this one is a church full of a lot of love a lot of love in our church by God's grace so I'm very thankful for that now remember that's the same thing who said Naomi said that and William said that they said they've been to a lot of churches oh then that visitor our sister Elizabeth came and she said to the church that she's been this church had the most love remember brother William left and he said I miss you already I miss the perfect love of Jesus in your congregation that doesn't mean we don't make mistakes it just means we let Jesus's forgiveness forgive all of our mistakes praise God so I've had at least three people come and tell me this is the real church with the real love of Jesus Christ now there's more than that I know that over the years but those are three that I remember so let's have the love of Christ let's treat each other with love and grace here by God's grace to correct people at time just we all I make mistakes I'll apologize let's have the love of Christ everybody can know they're followers of Jesus because they have love one for one for another by God's grace and when somebody curses you let me know if you don't got money to give them flowers I'll I'll pay I'll pay for flowers let's go give them some flowers let's get them a gift card not to Target because they're supporting the lgbtq agenda whatever I'ma stop supporting them just so you know I haven't gone to their place since since I heard they supported the trans movement I'm going to Walmart now they might not be much better but I'm going to Giant Eagle now and just Audi now but in other words if somebody's mean towards you let's show them the love of Jesus Christ praise God therefore so what's the conclusion we're justified by faith we have peace with God through who Jesus Christ notice I didn't say you have peace with God through your good works you don't have peace with God through yours your amazing faith your amazing power no I have peace with God because Jesus gave me peace with God amen praise God I have peace with God because of what Christ did for me Hallelujah amen I'm almost at my 15 minutes I got five more minutes so bear with me here by
