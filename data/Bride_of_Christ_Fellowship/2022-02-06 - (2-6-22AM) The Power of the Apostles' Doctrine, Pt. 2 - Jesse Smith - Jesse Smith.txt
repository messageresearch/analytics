TRANSCRIPT
========================================
ii timothy 4 verse 3. i like to preach on part 2 of the power of the apostles doctrine the power of the apostles doctrine it's though overall it's part 5 in our doctrine series but i'm just you know giving them little different titles there the power of the apostles doctrine second timothy four verse three before we read this you'll recall that god's prophet brother branham would use this scripture when he would ordain preachers so he would read of course verses 1 and 2 preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebrook i'm sorry rebuke rather exhort with all long suffering and doctrine we've been looking at doctrine the importance the necessity of doctrine verse three let's read that together one two three for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears so we know the end time will be a time when very few people will have sound doctrine that word sound means healthy they'll be very in other words there'll be many unhealthy churches because of the unhealthy spiritual things they allow and they teach but paul told timothy you must be a sound doctrine church now if you go to the previous chapter go to second timothy 3 and we'll read verse 10 and this is the main section lord willing will preach on as we we're kind of going to build to this text here uh we're going to preach some other scriptures to try to get to this point here and we'll try to uh focus on second timothy here but ii timothy 3 10. as we saw with jesus jesus said everyone knew my doctrine the night he was arrested he said i was daily teaching i was daily giving doctrine the world has heard me he didn't hide his doctrine he shared a doctrine he said the way you'll know my doctrine is if you obey it and then god will bless it god will vindicate that my doctrine was right and we see paul saying the same thing look at verse 10. let's read that verse 10 1 2 3 but thou has fully known my doctrine manner of life purpose faith long-suffering charity and patience praise god paul was known for his doctrine it was christ doctrine let's have one more word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's just make it known unto god whether raising hand or praying in your own heart heavenly father we thank you again for this opportunity lord let the holy spirit fall on each person today hallelujah lord let each person have a personal revival let it start in them lord god so the rest of their family the rest of their friends the rest of their co-workers the rest of their classmates lord those who are in school can see the revival in each person's life we pray hallelujah we know it's the bride's revival it's the individual's revival that your prophet started lord and it continues to burn today it burns in our hearts it burns in our our spirits lord god we thank you for that lord jesus and may lord your holy spirit have preeminence today meet every need lord god guide me and direct me by the holy spirit help me to be a united vessel that your word can be declared in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god so i have some slides here and some quotes and scriptures i'd like to show here by god's grace and i'm going to try not to preach two hours like last sunday okay so uh we have two services today so i am going to try to watch my time here but you know once you start preaching we just start getting heavenly places and and it's just hard to get out of that for me it wants it maybe uh it's hard once i get in it i don't i don't like to leave it but looking forward to the bible studies here today with the kids tonight and again again adults can ask any questions they want so austin aline and i talked about that you can ask any question you want we'll have a certain direction but you can interrupt at any time and just raise your hand and say what about this or what about that we'll do the best we can to answer those questions praise god we're looking at part five and we did recognize brother bang thank you again brother bang i'll regret our text i want to just really briefly review uh doctrine you know uh two sundays ago we were kind of snowed in and so i started this series uh over the live stream and and you were not with me uh so i haven't really showed these these slides but uh doctrine is the same as teaching and brother brahm said every man he said every preacher has a doctrine whether he admits it or not brother braham said you cannot have a ministry without having doctor because at some point you're teaching the people what to do you're teaching them how to be uh saved how to be filled with the holy ghost how to be healed right you're teaching them how to or how to find uh how to recognize your day and its message praise god how to do that praise god you're teaching them how to do something how can i overcome amen these are all doctrinal thoughts anything that's teaching you how to do something is a doctrinal message and brother brahm said i don't have the exact quote in front of me it's in my book um but brother and said the antichrist church will not receive true bride doctrine so we would expect the true bride to have true doctrine her doctrine would be bible doctrine but the antichrist group will have signs wonders and miracles just like the bride but they'll have false doctrine so that will be the separation because the the workers of iniquity say jesus we had prophesied we spoke in tongues we had many wonderful works we cast out devils but he said i never knew you you worker of iniquity you worked false doctrine you lived in false doctrine you propagated false doctrine amen but those who are saved did the will of my father which is in heaven amen and as brother adam said the evidence of the holy ghost is all god's children can be taught of god all god's children learn god's doctrine learn god's ways and therefore obey god and act just like their father because they're children of the heavenly father amen i'm just starting to get excited already now uh i don't want to get too fast though so doctrine in the greek there's three greek words that refer to doctrine and teaching and i can't pronounce these didascalia 21 mentions in the new testament didasco 91 mentions in new testament i call them hits because that's what uh the table software calls them and uh the word taut is didachi i never say that right 30. so there's 158 new testament uses and then there are other greek words for doc there's a few other for doctrine and teaching those are the main ones that i could find okay so let's look at their greek definition just so you understand that they're it's all uh it's all overlapping they're the same thing because dida scalia means teaching precepts instruction doctrine dadasco is to instruct so see the overlap of instruction to be a teacher impart instruction instill doctrine to one and then didachi is teaching instruction so the greek meanings are essentially the same so any any preacher that got up and said i'm going to teach today on this or i'm going to tell you how to do this they're actually offering doctrine they're offering instruction and every preacher has doctrine as brother brahm taught us amen but we have sound doctrine praise god our church has sound doctrine healthy doctrine praise god it's directing us to to live holy it's directing us to live righteously praise god in this present sinful world amen and now i just gave an example uh compare how much the bible uses doctrine and teaching versus latter rain which we all want to be in the latter rain right that's the rapturing faith brother brand tells us latter reign has nine mentions in the bible uh doctrine and teaching have almost 300 so which was which one does god place emphasis on god places more emphasis on doctrine and teaching because that's what you need for your everyday life praise god only the saints who live to the rapture really need that scripture about latter rain right that's that's the other ones need to know about it but really the only ones who who need that scripture about it are those who that will live to receive that praise god and we hope for that group amen but we may not be for no man knows the dare of the hour praise god and no man thought no man around brother brown thought it'd ever get to 2022 but here we are praise god and so we'll just keep marching on we'll keep serving the lord we'll keep we'll be about the father's business amen we'll work till jesus comes amen we won't get tired of this 11th hour praise god it's just one hour amen church you can work a little longer amen there's just one more hour till midnight praise god just keep laboring just keep working amen god will bless you praise god so the conclusion is those who love god's doctrine all 300 or so verses and teaching will be ready for the latter reign praise god that must be the conclusion because it was so important praise god now i want to just look at a few thoughts here before i get down to these second timothy verses that i'm going to try to be laboring on so your daily life reveals your doctrinal beliefs in other words the life that a person lives reveals their teaching your life reveals what you've accepted your life reveals what you really believe amen right because the pharisees were hypocrites they said one thing but they did another thing their life revealed what they really believed about doctrine praise god the fact that they hated jesus doctrine shows that they were very corrupt people praise god and jesus said outwardly you're beautiful but inwardly you're full of dead men's bones right they prayed long prayers on purpose to try to impress people right they they went into widows houses to try to get their inheritance money they were just wicked people on the inside they didn't like jesus miracles they didn't like the supernatural didn't like women kissing jesus feet and weeping for repentance they didn't like see people being saved but we like all that amen we like healings praise god we like salvation we like people weeping their way to jesus amen hallelujah you see your daily life reveals your doctrinal beliefs now let me just show a few examples of what i'm talking about now adam clarke was a baptist i'm sorry was a methodist preacher in the man age right it's about a little after the time of john wesley so he would have come after john wesley and these these men of that day had tremendous commentaries now um in titus 2 verse 1. i'm just going to read it real quick it says but speak thou the things which become sound doctrine so we're supposed to constantly talk sound doctrine right and paul was of course writing that uh to titus now adam clark says about this this is a conclusion drawn from the preceding chapter the judaizing teachers were only taught a false doctrine but they led an unholy life titus was to act directly opposite amen so see the jews that titus was battling there they taught wrong and they lived wrong but paul tells titus you do the opposite amen you teach right and live right amen hallelujah he must teach a sacred doctrine and the things which become it he must proclaim the truth and illustrate the truth the people must not only be well instructed they must be holy in their lives as well principle and practice must go hand in hand amen in other words i must practice what i preach if i don't i'm a liar i'm a hypocrite amen is that right but if i practice what i preach then i'm a man of sound doctrine i'm a holy man i'm a righteous man i'm a man that god wants to use amen hallelujah now don't be discouraged if people say well why are you reading from other preachers brother branham was the one who said that these men had the greatest sermons and the greatest writings ever i didn't say that brother branham said that he said in the days of john wesley the preaching of the word was never greater the preaching of the word now how come you don't hear people say this because they like to worship william branham that's why but look how humble william branham was i thought you believed every quote well then why don't you believe this there's no greater preaching ever than william branham that's a lie brother brandon even said the previous age because the man's wisdom had greater preaching not greater revelation but somehow greater preaching i can't explain it but that's what he said as satan raised up hordes of free thinkers as the originators of communism arose up as liberal theologians spread their filthy wares god raised up mighty warriors of faith and the greatest works of christian literature and teaching and preaching came from this era not the second greatest and the church said never has its preachers and teachers been matched and never will they be that's a hard pill for branham worshipers to swallow we honor brother branham but we're not random worshippers random worshipers say every word on the tape is thus saith the lord that's a lie from satan brotherham said there's mix-ups on the tapes he said but he said the tapes point us to the absolute which is jesus christ the word of god amen brother man prayed made the absolute of this entire congregation he said may they look away from me or servant and may they look to jesus christ who is the absolute and may they make jesus christ be their absolute and all their faith in god's word amen the spurgeons parkers mclarens edwards bunions mueller's brainerds barns bishops all came from this area they preached taught and wrote the word they glorified his name so adam clark was one of the preachers of this era praise god that's a hard pill for some people to swallow but brother branham said if you have any light in you he said you'll see the truth that's in the church age book how come they don't preach those because they don't like those hallelujah now church i kind of ended last week's message with this this thought because we live in a three-part room i'm sorry a three-part house you have a body mind and soul we constantly battle the sin that lays in our body and even though our soul believes every word of god our soul has never sinned we've been through that out of first john chapter 3 the seed of god cannot sin yet we continue to sin at times because we we we don't choose the influence of the spirit of god in our souls and we get selfish or or we uh we choose to obey the lust of the flesh or the lust of the eyes or the pride of life and we sin every day and many times as things we knew was wrong to begin with praise god so in other words what i'm saying is you can be a holy ghost-filled saint but then battle a certain sin for years and years and years you'll get victory off and on over right you won't be a slave to it but every like the bible said satan will come back for another season a season of hard battles praise god and we're not excusing sin but we're looking at the reality of being a christian the reality of living a christian life is you have a seed of god inside of you that cannot sin but then you have a flesh body who is your worst enemy praise god you live in a part where you live in a body where a being where you part of you is your worst enemy but part of you is your your victory praise god hallelujah the spirit of god inside of you is your greatest source of strength but then your body is your greatest source of failure so as with doctrine what i mean is that we can all recognize true doctrine true i know i should be doing this but then we still fall short anyway but i want to teach this so you don't quit the christian fight and you don't let satan put guilt over on you because this is something every believer has battled down through the ages you are not alone your experience is no different than anybody else there's no temptation that's given except what's common to man right there's someone in the bible that you can look to who you that person can understand what you're going through now praise god and just as that person was never alone you're not alone either praise god the holy spirit is here praise god god's spirit is here he's i'm here to help you encourage you strengthen you praise god and help you be an overcomer amen even if it takes you years to surrender i don't know i'm going to prove it here by the word of god amen you'll battle spirits off and on you'll get victory for a while but then you'll give in and you'll feel so condemned well i'm here to tell you there's no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus amen who walk after the spirit and not the flesh hallelujah amen now i'm going to skip past this because that was my outline paul delivered the high calling in other words paul delivered the exact way to live by sound doctrine but he himself and every believer was constantly struggling to live it that's our daily struggle which of you have ever made it through a day where you didn't sin that whole day probably none of you right and if by the end you got there then you got prideful saying look what i did and then you just sinned just ruined your whole day right and i'm going to show you some quotes some of these you'll be familiar with from brother branham so this means paul would have committed sins he knew were wrong just like we see in brother branham's life and our lives because paul said i count not myself to have apprehended i'm not perfect in other words i haven't apprehended i don't have everything under control i haven't grasped every every concept i haven't grasped every power of god does he sound like he's prideful or humble what do we got today a bunch of message people i'm the bride i never did it in the first place i'm so holy and they're so lazy they don't reach out to the poor they don't pray like they ought to they don't vote they don't do nothing they just go to church and talk and be prideful that's all they do and feed their bodies and get get unhealthy they don't fast they don't they don't read their bibles nothing they just press play and they just hear what they want to hear see paul was humble and yet i would put his miracles against anybody alive today i would say paul's would be greater than all theirs because he said i labored more abundantly than all the other apostles too that means peter james john paul labored more than all of them he said but this one thing i do i forget glory those things that are behind church forget your past amen and reach for those things which are before you amen because i press towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus let us therefore as many as be perfect or complete be thus minded and if any if anything ye be otherwise minded god shall even reveal this unto you so see paul knew he had the revelation of jesus he said if anybody changes anything it's cursed but he said i've not i've apprehended everything i'm not the master of of everything i i don't know at all i'm not a no-no but i'm pressed i'm forgetting the past i'm confessing my sins amen leaving them in the past and i'm pressing forward toward the mark of the high calling amen glory we should have the same attitude confess your sins and move on and press towards a life that's worthy of the gospel you'll never get perfection as far as sinless life here in this body you'd only get that until you get a new body praise god when you get a new body then you'll never sin praise god in other words we're always going to sin here so don't dwell on that confess it or try to overcome it praise god but keep pressing toward a more holy life a more obedient life keep grasping let that be your goal let not not more money or not more luster make obedience your goal praise god reach for that grasp for that like paul said i'm pressing towards the mark of the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus because john says if any of you say you have no sin you're a liar but then he says the next two chapters later he said if you've got the seed of god you don't commit sin what does that mean your soul doesn't sin because it's anointed you have the holy ghost nature you have a portion or measure of god's spirit in your soul and that spirit cannot sin but we sin in our minds we think the wrong thing and then we sit in our flesh right by obeying the lust of the flesh right now let me just give you a visual maybe this will help you i was trying to think how can i help the people paul gave us the high calling right now there's a road how many know there's a narrow road but how many know sometimes you're not always driving the middle of the road praise god like peter where was peter in the middle of the road when he was saying i'm not going to eat with those gentiles those dirty whatever they are i don't know what he said but was paul living in the middle of the road no because paul after peter peter was not living in the middle road because paul had come by and stick his finger under his nose and said you're to be blamed so where was peter so i'll just use an example so there's times in our lives where we're completely obedient right to the word of god we're living right in the middle of the road but then paul said he hasn't apprehended anything there was times i'm going to show you he made sins he did things that he hated he gave into the flesh brother austin and he said oh wretched man that i am how can a man that's born again filled with the holy ghost be wretched because he gave into his flesh and he said i'm i'm not always as strong as i want to be sometimes i make mistakes so same thing you could put peter out here too sometimes peter made a little mistake but was he still on the road yes he was still on the road god did not throw him off into the ditch like we believe people out here that that leave the message and and uh blasting the message we believe they're out there they're drowning you know they're they're they're lost if they blaspheme the word of god if they call the the ministry of brother branham a ministry of the devil they blast him the holy ghost right so here paul he's trying to stay in the middle of the road how many are trying to stay in the middle of the road let's say he got off but then god brings him back closer you know this is our desire as we go further down the road we want to be in the middle of the road we want to be complete obedience to the word of god does everybody understand what i'm saying now we make little missteps we get or can i say like this we get a little unbalance in our doctrine right so peter has a good example if i had more time i would put peter up there peter would have got off a little bit on that idea with not eating with gentiles paul straightened him out praise god now i won't just use this idea here i just want to use this idea now brother austin here's that scripture i want to show you and everybody paul's writing in romans 7 he says we know the law is spiritual like you only a spiritual being can obey these things but i am carnal i'm sold under sin so in other words i'm a slave to sin in my flesh for that which i do i allow not for what i would that i do not but what i hate that i do so paul is saying because i have sin trapped in my body i hate it but yet sometimes i obey the the sin of my body i give in and i sin against the lord if then i do that which i would not i don't want to do it i consent unto the law that it's good now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me now look here he separates the soul from his flesh amen so paul says i do things that i hate but it's really not my soul it's my my spirit and my flesh that do it amen may god help us to find that balance praise god for i know that in me that is in my flesh he never said soul soul is only the good thing that's the holy ghost dwelt no good thing there's nothing good in your flesh for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not so paul constantly wanted to get his flesh to obey the word of god but he couldn't find it how can i get this thing to obey god's word all the time he couldn't find it but that's how god wanted it praise god god wanted you to fight praise god god wanted you to trust him for every victory all the time every day 24 7 365 days a year god wants you to learn to lean upon him like jesus did for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i don't want to do that i do so but austin there's gonna sister lena there's gonna be times we don't wanna do sin but anyways we'll give in because we're weak in that moment we get off the very center of god's will now we're not we're still on the right road we're still saved for if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelt in me i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me isn't that true you want to do something good you want to overcome but then right there is the flesh right there i want you to say this i want you to act on this i want you to go buy this i want you to do that say that for i delight in the law of god after the inward man but i see another law in my memory so he has two laws the law of god and the law of sin warren against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members so listen george every time we sin we've actually come under captivity to sin we've been a very we're a temporary prisoner to sin now not demon possessed right but we the paul says i came into captivity i got caught in a trap the church said paul said riches are traps they're snares right so is pride so it's fear so is depression so all these things are trapped satan sets out there and sometimes we purposely walk into him and the church said sometimes we perk we shouldn't do it we know it's wrong but we purposely will walk into it we purposely put ourselves into captivity and we sin on purpose now look what paul calls himself a man who had more revelation than any of us could ever have what does he call himself i'm the bride i'm a big somebody i'm so holy i never did in the first place he said o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death i thank god through jesus christ our lord so then with the mind i serve myself serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin praise god so can everybody see this the longer we live the more we should recognize yes we have god inside of us but we've got to yield to that and if we don't yield to that we purposely uh let the devil we purposely walk into his traps and we become trapped in that and we have to repen to get out of that trap if not we'll be a slave to that and we'll keep going down the wrong road i trust everybody's hearing me by god's grace now this is romans 7 but never be discouraged because romans 8 is a powerful chapter paul paul begins it by saying there is there therefore no condemnation of them that are in christ jesus remember there's no chapter of divisions when paul wrote this so paul's saying oh wretched man that i am but then he says but when i walk in the spirit there's no condemnation to me praise god and they said who shall separate me from the love of god shall death persecution principles he said nothing shall separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus amen hallelujah it's god's love that save me it's god though that's going to keep me praise god it's god's love that's going to take me home amen hallelujah so that's the attitude we got to have now church listen we are not workers of iniquity because they're lost their souls are lost they're not sealed by the holy ghost but we do need forgiven of our iniquities for if brother branham i forgot to change that i should for brother branham committed thousands of sins a year like brother brahm said he did how many of those did he know were wrong now let me get to this quote here so i can show it to you okay let's read this brother ram said he made thousands of sins in a year thousands i have no holiness to present to him what i'm trusting in is oh his grace and i have in my heart i'm unmerited at nothing i could do to deserve it but by grace he called me invited me to come and i looked at him and he took the desire away from me i make thousands of mistakes in a much in a month in a year surely i do but when i see i'm wrong i say god i didn't mean to do it you know my heart i didn't mean to do that i was trapped and that snared into that i became captive into that i didn't mean to do it you forgive me lord if i'd done wrong to my brother i said brother forgive me i didn't mean to do that certainly god knows my heart oh there you are there is the blood sacrifice there's the power of the gospel you imagine a thousand sins a year but the power of the gospel forgives every single one praise god that and that not just you but me all of us amen the blood of jesus christ wipes all these thousands ten thousands hundreds of thousands millions of sins away that's the power of the gospel amen that's good news to me hallelujah the blood of jesus christ there is the power of the gospel that holy church moving on despite my thousands of mistakes every year i'm just forgetting it i'm moving on i'm moving on the grace of god i'm more than a conqueror in christ jesus amen because i have two laws inside of me right not because something you've done is something you had nothing to do with he said that's the atonement amen now let's go back now do you understand this if brother branham had thousands now i'll go on the small number thousands would be at least two right so two thousand if he had two thousand sins a year how many of those do you think were new temptations he never knew before how many times have you said to me like oh i didn't realize that was a sin how many honest people do we have here today everybody's honest do you think all all two thousand oh i didn't know that should not do that that's new to me i didn't know that was a sin and we're all reading our bibles every day and praying praise god we're all listening to sermons and praising god in our homes oh there's 2 000 things you didn't know this year when you commit a sin and you know it's wrong that's called iniquity but the bible says paul says let everyone that nameth the name of christ depart from iniquity see workers of iniquity never depart they continue doing those wicked things all the time but we're gonna get tempted we're gonna fall off we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna do things we know are wrong iniquities but then the grace of god is gonna bring us back into obedience we're not gonna continue doing that we're gonna get victory for a season stumble a little bit a righteous man falls seven times but he raises up amen he's gonna get back on the path but the work of iniquity continues in that and leaves the path and then they blaspheme the path and say that that's not the real way the church should be run that's not a true church they're a false church while they live under the anointing at times but then they also live under the ho or the unholy anointing as well all right this is why we did this memory verse children bless the lord o my soul forget not all of his benefits you know when i got my job i was very thankful for insurance i got insurance for my kids you know dental health all these things but let me tell you there's no benefits and insurance like god's benefits and insurance so actually when i became a christian i actually got the best benefits package i've ever got in my life and here it is right here praise god amen he gives to all children i'm going to forgive you all not some not a tenth not eighty percent not half a hundred percent of your iniquities amen things you knew were wrong i'm forgiving you of all your purposeful transgressions not some of them all of them praise god see how god's benefits are way better than ours brother bang i'll go to the doctor i still gotta do a 15 co-payer now it's 30 copay they don't forgive all of my debt but god said i forgive it all right i praise god i'm forgiven you have to pay nothing amen just trust in the sacrifice just trust my eternal assurance policy amen hallelujah i'm forgiving all your iniquities and i'm going to heal all thy diseases in one way or another praise god whether by death or whether by a supernatural miracle quickly or divine healing takes weeks months years however long i heal all diseases and i redeem your life your life won't be for destruction your life will be for victory your life will be for glorification of god almighty amen hallelujah not destruction but glorification of god's kingdom amen and then god cross your life god places a crown upon your life it's a crown of loving kindness and tender mercies so what do you have to do with that crown anyway is it your loving kindness that you're crowned with well look what i did no we're actually jesus shares his crown we're actually wearing what he's done it's his loving kindness you're wearing it it's his mercy that you go along i'm a i'm a king of his mercy i'm a king of god's loving kindness amen that's what i am that's what you are praise god god crowns your life with that everybody looks and see wow they have god's mercy on them amen god loves them amen that's what your life is crowned with what an insurance policy that's god's eternal policy amen see he's got to put that in there because you have iniquities all the way up to you die or get a body change i'm gonna say this about my grandpa my grandpa was a wonderful man of god he was probably only sanctified he prayed for numerous people and they raised from the dead even his own life at the end of his life my mom said he would whistle at some of the nurses because they were they were they were a sexy dress or something like that now i hope he repented of that but i want you to see that's an example of an 80-something-year-old man who saw the miracles he saw some of us he probably saw greater miracles than i've ever seen but there he's still battling what he's still battling that flesh i'm trusting he was saved i trust he made it right before he went over i never seen a man shout like him cry like him praise like jesus i can still hear him singing when i go to church in the back of my head i can still hear him sing this is my story thank you jesus you'll have this spanish accent this is my song he told me all these testimonies about god doing reckless things one time he was on the highway on 77 south and he said he swerved out of his lane and was going head on to a 18-wheel truck and he just shout out jesus and a minute later he woke up on the side of the road and his car was in perfect condition and his wife was passed out as well and they're caught nothing was wrong with their car now that's his and his wife's testimony my my grandfather and grandmother they're both passed on now but church don't tell me that god can't do great miracles like that if god can translate phillip amen if god can translate philip from one city to another can't god translate somebody from the side of the from on the road to the side of the road hallelujah but after all those years he's doing things he know he shouldn't done but i believe in this the blood of jesus christ forgives all our iniquities and i trust the holy spirit brought him to conviction of that even as a 80 some year old man how many want god's grace to cover you all the days of your life how many want an insurance policy from god that lasts from salvation all the way to death i do and of course we never support that right we never support lusting after women but that's the fact of his life we could see mighty miracles but then we could also see the human side the sinful side sin inside of his members here's the point if brother ram said i sin thousands of times a year if you just do 2000 that means you sin almost five and a half times a day so can you relate to that yeah i could relate to that i got mad five times or i lustful thoughts or i had selfish thoughts or i was pride critical thoughts five times oh yeah probably right and then romans paul repeats this in romans the same idea even as david described the blessedness of the man whom god imputed righteousness without works god said i'm just going to make you righteous not because of what you did but because of what i did praise god you just repented and accepted that's all you did was repent and believe and i'm gonna give you jesus righteousness and i'm gonna take your iniquity on on christ and god said blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered you don't think peter knew he was doing wrong when he separated from the gentiles of course he knew because he'd already met cornelius he'd already eaten with cornelius he stayed there certain days he already said the holy ghost fell on them but years later months later however long it was he got trapped in a trap of the devil and the jewish people convinced him well i'm not going to eat with them anymore maybe they are still living in sin and yet he was a man of god yet he was a prophet blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin oh that's the kind of blessed i want to be praise god don't bless me with billions of dollars don't bless me as a ceo bless me with the fact that all my sins are forgiven that's what i want to be blessed with amen hallelujah so there's a quote again and there's there's numerous quotes like this so don't say well he's just using one quote there's numerous quotes like this now let's look at this the it seems to me now it seems to me this the sin brother branham battled most during his life was the critical spirit because he plainly says it in 1954. he'd already been preaching 21 years 21 years i've only been preaching with 2000 i gotta do my math now 18 years 18 years he's already been preaching 20 some years 21 years and then he has to repent for calling the church members ricky and regetta and admits he's wrong and then in 1963 he says he lost the feeling for the people wanted to quit going to churches paul had to learn contentment and remember this is one of his not the last letter but one of his last letters before his martyrdom we know second timothy was the last letter but paul said he's talking about the the rejoicing of the philippians and their giving to paul he said not that i speak in respect of want for i have learned in whatever state i am therewith to be content i know how to be humble to based i know how to abound and have lots of natural things everywhere and in all things i'm instructed there is he's taught by the holy spirit both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need amen like brother austin was telling me and like we preached on last week when we suffer we have to say thank you lord for allowing me to suffer you're helping me to sup to learn to suffer like you did because we must be partakers of his suffering paul said i've learned both amen i can learn to suffer but i can learn to have abundance but in every state no matter where i am i've learned to be content i can be happy in christ no matter what season i'm going through that's all we need to be praise god so could paul learn yes paul could learn so this means he had to battle being discontent if he learned contentment then he would have battled discontentment some people i'll be honest some people in the message almost worship brother branham and paul like the alpha prophet and the omega prophet they're almost like they're almost like well show me where uh brother ram was ever corrected after the seals show me where paul was ever corrected after he got the revelation well of course the bible don't record everything like that but he's still a man he still said i'm a wretched man that i am what do you think they became after the seals brother man became deity it's foolish he said put all he he said in the in the seventh seal right after the seals were finished brother man said uh he said he said you forget anything about me said put all this grace on jesus christ he said i'm a sinner say by grace amen he said not fit to live and he said none of us are amen he said none of us are fit to live in other words the opening of the seals was all done by the orchestration of jesus christ amen and brother man was just the vessel that he used praise god see that's it's that deity spirit right if they won't worship the tapes then uh like like the fog jeffersonville movement then that deity spirit will get him to worship brother branham and paul after the seals it's just it's ridiculous but you know if they if they love that spirit that's why they get it now here's where he says it church now look i did preparations years ago in that other sanctuary if i'm bringing it back it's like eight years later i'm bringing it back brother branham went to the pulpit brother vang knowing he had a critical spirit and he says i want the church one more thing before or ask the church one more thing before i get to my place scriptures that is that you'll pray for me i've developed a critical spirit in other words i've got trapped into a trap of the enemy and i have i'm trapped in the trap of a critical spirit right like we saw trapped and it what it helps me does it help him haunts him church if you're a real child of god your sins will haunt you too in other words you'll feel bad you won't be condemned but you'll know i'm not i'm not in the middle of the road there it is right there and the church said he's going to the pulpit brother bang to preach the word of god he said pray for me i've got i've developed this i fed this black dog oh there it is my goodness hallelujah i fed the black dog more than the white dog in this in this area of my life i told my wife yesterday the first time something happened now and i was sitting in the yard i told her she reminded me and i told her about it i said honey i've got to a place till i become critical people i don't want to be whose job is it's not mine and god is the one to criticize not me and then if you read the rest of this quote he goes and shows four examples of the people he was critical of he said every time he saw the voice healing magazine he was critical every time he has heard this preacher critical criticize criticize tear down tear down he said pray for me i'm haunted by this and he'd been preaching since 1933 21 years and the church said did you think he do you think he um he never knew a critical spirit was wrong do you think that's what happened or do you think he knew a critical spirit was wrong what do you think church of course he knew it was wrong of course he knew it was wrong to criticize people of course we know it's wrong when we do sins this is supposed to help you church this is going to help you if you really receive this you realize i need the blood for every day every hour i need it all the time because sometimes i'll fall i walk right into the trap because the devil was watching me and he set that trap i walked right into it i knew i should not have done it but if i say i'm sorry god will forgive me amen and i can forget those things of the past amen and i can press on toward the mark of the high calling of god in christ jesus it's going to help us praise god don't tell me brother didn't know what a critical spirit was he'd been preaching for 21 years and he's been criticized this whole ministry there it is right there he's been criticized you don't think he knew what a critical spirit was i'm trying to show you that we we don't sin in our souls but our mind and body sin right and it's called iniquity because we know better but the blood of jesus forgives all iniquity now here's the ricky and ricketta quote it takes the love of god to dash out there on the front line and stand in the gap for the people so what's that mean if there's a gap between the preacher and the people that means the people are lost that means the people have a gap between the preacher and them so brother man said it takes the love of god to stand between people that are being disobedient to stand in the gap and try to unite them to a holy god that's what standing the gap is i'm trying to unite them there's a gap between god and the people it takes god's love amen it takes god's love to go to people that are sinners amen that's going to help you praise god if you when you go to people that are sinners or trapped in their sin that's the love of god moving you to do that i'm trying not to spit on people here guys guys now look what he says and these rickeys and requettas that have so sassed the words and i've called them ricky ricketta god give me to understand i shouldn't do that because that's many of them are still his children he's name-calling god's children when they're not yet in the condition of being saved they can't help because they act so much different some of these old cold former churches have got them that spirit upon them and they're in much in prison as israel was in prison just as much as moses went down to deliver them from slavery human beings that love jesus christ would serve him if they only know what to serve him by i think we can all relate to that oh if only if i had only just known the message sooner i would have obeyed it praise god amen hallelujah same for you same for me if i only got a chance to hear i'd receive it hallelujah and they're in bondage under denominationalism that tells them don't do this and you don't do that but the call of god must come whoever wants the march towards the promised land let it march we're on our road to the promised land amen let them come march we're on a road to meet christ at the end time and i wanted to bring this to you so that you would see and show you that the mistake that a man can get yet being sincere so brother and preach this sermon stand in the gap again this kind of review for some of you to show that he developed a sinful complex because god had to correct him on his attitude his critical attitude toward the people that were in denominations and weren't living the right way and he lost his compassion can we all say can everybody say compassion can we compassion he lost his compassion for sinners have you ever done that have you ever thought well they deserve i thought that about government leaders because they're murderers but i've got to say god forgive me i don't want to judge them i want to pray for them they murder all these babies if they don't repent no doubt they're going to hell but i don't want to have a critical spirit toward them with no hope or anything i want to i want to have a feeling to for them that i can still pray for them so brother ram says i want to preach a sermon so you can know that even men like me prophets can make mistakes and yet know better something's got to change and mean now look he's at the pulpit again preaching i'm the only preacher in here brother sergey are you preacher brother okay pray so you and i can relate to this okay and it's okay if you can't relate to it it's okay but sometimes church we got to come up here and we're battling complexes we're battling spirits in our own lives if brother ram did it you think sergey and i are are void from that we don't have to deal with that of course we do he said before brother man said before i go out to the other churches outside of jeffersonville in my heart if i go out there feeling the way i do now i still feel they ought to have heard the message they ought to have done it and i don't have the feeling for the people that i should have until i can get that feeling there's no need in me going because i'd be a hypocrite look what his attitude was they should have already received it so i'm not going to go to them now what about our attitude my family member hasn't received the message yet why are they gave them a book why are you already pray for them don't feel that way don't lose the feeling don't lose the feeling of the people don't lose your compassion that's actually a snare of the enemy right they should have heard it by now how could they were raised in it or you know i've told them how many times i gave them this i gave that don't lose your compassion as a christian and all these years i've tried to serve them with a true heart and i won't go out there being a hypocrite i got to feel that that it isn't ricky and ricketta's out there in the churches it isn't this bunch it's god's children that's in bondage that i must go until i can feel that way i'll just have to loaf around preach some conventions and things but wait so brother bran wanted to feel that the complex left him before he went praise god don't we want to feel victory before we try to do something for god i want to know i'm delivered first before i start trying to do something i want to know my feeling has changed my attitude has changed praise god god bless you each one and we hope to see you again real soon until then will you do me this one favor oh what do you want a prophet of god both here and on tapes also pray that god will place into my heart that's something that i lost out there in that complex it's so easy to build a complex will you pray that god will place it in there now the only way god god can't force it in there oh there we go so in other words he's saying pray for me that i will surrender my complex and that i will receive that compassion back in my heart because god's not gonna force you to do anything he's not gonna force you to obey he's not gonna force you to disobey that's the beauty of free more agency amen praise god hallelujah in other words pray for me that i'll repent of my complex and god's love can come back into my heart where it should be and i know it should be so is this a new sin to brother branham the critical spirit complex or is this an older thing he's fought for years hmm sounds like he's known about it for years oh bro jess i would never do that okay well let me watch your life for a few days let me go back and uh let me reference when we had that conversation about five years ago and you're still struggling with that same thing just like me right just like all of us amen we're human praise god brother iran was prone to battle a critical spirit what about those that are prone and brother the preacher will know it those that are prone to battle depression those that are prone to battle lust that's just that's that's their battle they got to overcome that battle how about lying those that are prone they don't tell the truth they exaggerated a lot we'll get victory for a while feel real good but then a trap will be set and we know it's wrong and sometimes we walk right in that it's so hard to build a complex no it's so easy to build a complex see we're not constantly checking up our lives with the word of god daily repenting and the church said repenting at every service i just know when is it going to get done i enjoyed it but when can we move on you shouldn't move on from the word take the word with you amen don't move on from the word take the word with you praise god keep your life clean it's so easy to fall into a trap of the enemy isn't it i can say amen to that it's so easy it's not hard it's easy see now look church everybody battles in these three errors you might battle more in the lust of the flesh the flesh wants something you might battle with the lust of the eyes the eyes want to go do that the pride of life so where is brother brown the pride of life if you're criticizing others if you're if you expect them to repent on your timetable rather than god's that's pride come on church you're going to battle you and i are going to battle on one of these errors i'm not going to walk around and say brother bang which one do you battle but amen which one sister brother sister nina brother which one you battle no you know take 10 seconds now and think about what did you struggle with yesterday where does it fall under here sometimes it's all three praise god amen let's not act like we're holy rollers around here and never make a mistake never sin that's a liar sometimes you'll battle it for years but my god's grace is sufficient your god's grace is sufficient in your weakness hallelujah in other words you know the doctrine's right but you still disobey it not in every area but just maybe one or two little areas i appreciate an honest church don't you i appreciate honest preachers brother bran was i'm sorry brother abraham not really brother abraham was over 75 god told him don't you leave canaan and he left when a famine came do you think he knew better church what do you think did you do when abraham lied twice about sarah do you think he knew better or not dude what do you think or is that new oh i shouldn't lie about my wife do you think so or was that iniquity was that a new thing or was that iniquity thank god he forgives all our iniquities praise god if he forgave abraham's amen then he forgives me and mine because i'm a child of abraham your children of abraham by faith in jesus amen if you forgive abraham's sins you're going to forgive your sins too we have a better covenant with better promises david fell to it he did all the will of god the bible said he only fell with the area of bathsheba but the bible still says adultery murder and pride when he numbered the people you don't think he knew better than the number of people of course he did that's why god killed what was it 23 000 or was it 70 something so it might have been 70 000 do you remember okay it was in second samuel he numbered the people in his life and 20 or 50 80 some 70 000 some huge number of people died because he got the pride of life the iniquity of pride that he fell into this is to encourage you i hope everybody's encouraged just face it you're going to commit iniquities and if you don't please come tell me the secret like what is the secret because if anybody needs to know it's the preacher well i know there is no secret the secret is you've got two laws in you and you're not perfect and you need a savior and god wants you to grow in the knowledge and the grace of the lord jesus christ god wants you to forget the things that are behind you and press on toward the mark of the high calling of god in christ jesus you can't say david knew better abraham knew better brother branham knew better brother jesse knows better all of our brothers and sisters here we know better these aren't new things i shouldn't yell my children i shouldn't i shouldn't do that hey i shouldn't i shouldn't go to that website i shouldn't look at that you know better i shouldn't say that you knew better now a real holy ghost-filled saying will only go so far so i'm not given a license for sin you can only go so far if you're really born again if not get born again that's what brother man said the holy ghost keeps you from major sins he said you'll do minor ones but you won't do major ones that's right now here's kind of where i wanted to get to let's see yeah so get your bibles here second timothy 3 1. that's all what i wanted to see i thought i'd preach all that on wednesday night see i just i always underestimate how much preaching i have second timothy 3 1. let me look at the rest of my notes yeah i got a lot so i have to skip some okay ii timothy 3 1. what i'll do is i'll just preach this and i'll bring it down to close because it's almost 12 now i've almost had an hour and a half to preach to you what's going on here somebody's messing with that clock trustees you go investigate everybody somebody mess with that clock somebody's cutting off my preaching time i should say please go check no it's not i'm just joking second timothy 3 1. now this is an absolute rebuke for laodicea this is an absolute rebuke on the sin loving churches of laodicea because it's the last days verse one know this also then the last days perilous or dangerous times shall come it also means fierce times aren't we living in a fierce time you can say one thing and people will fiercely oh man that was fierce just for saying i love jesus they'll fiercely oppose you oh you're against homosexuality but fears you believe in paying ties they'll blow you up you believe brother braham can be corrected but he said no over and over again i could be corrected i want to be corrected fierce times we're living in that's okay we got a strong god and don't forget he gave us six pieces of armor amen god would not put us in this awful perilous troublesome fierce times without giving us protection amen hallelujah the sword of the spirit amen all the other six pieces the armor of god you're equipped with so saints don't worry don't run stand in that evil day stand against the wiles of the enemy they think they're fierce but i'll tell you really you're more fierce who's more fierce the devil or god amen you're more fierce amen hallelujah when you stand on god's word who's more dangerous the devil are you you're more dangerous because you've got god's word just got to use it glory now look at this next slide here i got two lists so here's verses one uh i went to the wrong chapter that's why i was having trouble one to five verses one to five and then here's verses 10 10 and 11. so one to five in the same chapter so we're going to look at here's what the last days or fierce dangerous times look like but here's paul's example so this is a contrast between evil and good how do we overcome all this evil the last days paul tells us have paul's doctrine observe his manner of life his purpose his faith his long suffering his charity his patience that long suffering you can suffer a long time somebody won't repent that's okay i can suffer a long time with them patience so look at this list we don't have to read it but i'll read it quickly self love we have to make sure we don't love ourselves praise god we gotta take care of ourselves like brother said you gotta take care of god's man take care of god's woman don't wear her out don't wear them out but don't love yourself covetous they want everything boasters braggers proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful they never say thank you unholy without natural fiction they don't love children that's why they love abortions right they don't love natural men and women marriages truce breakers they break their covenants false accusers incontinent fierce despisers those that are good traders heady high-minded lovers of pleasures more lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power there where's the power paul it's in my doctrine hallelujah that's what jesus said jesus was known for his power and his doctrine praise god what new doctrine is this jesus you walk into a synagogue you teach and you cast out devils what new doctrine is this this is the kingdom of god amen that's our doctrine praise god the kingdom or rulership of god but also you have a question buddy uh like worship like uh it all it's all in the motivation so like if you're working out to stay healthy well if you're looking at the mirror and saying oh man look at that i think this is my best side you know that that's where it's become sinful but if you're eating right and uh you know trying to drink water and all those good things and that's not worshiping you that's saying lord i want to keep this body healthy so i'm not sick so i can serve you better right that's kind of how i you got to look at the motivation is it for me to get attention or is it for me to serve god that's a very quick answer but i'm sure we could give more that's a great question brother so paul how are you going to overcome this he said verse 10 but you have known my doctrine see doctrine doesn't allow this doctrine doesn't teach self-love that's what the that's what the prosperity gospel is all about see i could i could preach a sermon on all these all false doctrines and how they're all in the not the nominal churches self-love lovers of pleasures more and over to god in the next chapter paul said they're ever learning but never able to come to knowledge of truth but brother sergey knows it they can learn hebrew words they can learn greek language but they can never come to the fact that the lord jesus christ is the name of god how do they miss that amen they'll go to greek and hebrew to prove three persons which is three gods right or they'll go to greek and hebrews say women can preach which is the jezebel spirit the demonic antichrist spirit ruling over the churches hiding behind a beautiful woman with high heels on and paint all over her face it's from hell lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god they won't endure they won't put up with sound doctrine they'll close their ears say don't preach it i don't want to hear i don't want to hear it and they're the ones that shouldn't be heard they're the ones that should close their preachers their churches because they're preaching doctrines of devils so paul how are you different than the perilous times the last days my doctrine made me different they all had miracles they all had the anointing the anointed ones at the end times i thank god for the anointing but i got more of anointing just to do miracles i got anointing to have the manner of life the purpose the doctrine that paul had amen hallelujah faith long suffering charity patience and then god delivered me from all my trials oh thank you jesus and look at verse 12. i didn't get to verse 12. yeah all that live godly in christ jesus will suffer persecution so get ready for it if you're living right you're gonna have to suffer you haven't yet already verse 13 but evil men and seducers so false teachers are going to get worse yes they're actually get worse with their false doctrine deceiving and being deceived seeing as long as they love that false evil spirit you can never convince them anyway you can't convince them you can't they'll never hear soundness they'll never hear this is healthy this is this is true i can see this they'll never until they until they repent of loving that lie and that spirit that goes with it they'll never see the truth but that's fine paul said you know my life you know my doctrine you know the doctrine unto godliness that's what that's what the false churches don't have they don't have godly lives right like my one friend he loves god but he was so off he told four-year-olds that they can do greater miracles in jesus because greater work shall these shall these do because i go to my father that's a that's a total false understanding of that scripture jesus meant more works not greater who's going to do greater than jesus nobody can do greater than jesus nobody's greater than jesus i love jesus jesus you're greater than everybody amen amen hallelujah and the same guy teaches a few weeks later that's okay to watch black panther now i've never watched it but i heard a preacher say they do demonic ceremonies on that they bury people in sand and they have a cult they have occult sessions right there and then he's telling all the people to go watch he's telling all the kids to go watch him like that's the last time this guy's preaching can you imagine that these are these are these easy times these are dangerous times have they can learn all these things but they can never come to the truth they learn all this knowledge out there which is all fine out there all these stats well there's what the stats are about american families here's what the stats about you know government all these things but they can never come to the simple truth where you need to be saved sanctified and filled with the holy ghost they can't come to that knowledge praise god okay i'm going to skip this uh i'm going to come down to close okay give me 10 minutes here now close the live stream i just want to share a few personal things with the church here so god bless all live streamers we love you and keep praying for us by god's grace okay yeah whenever i do
