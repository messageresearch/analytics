[0:00] Thank you, Lord, for every good and
[0:02] perfect gift that's been given from the
[0:04] Father of lights above. Lord, you've
[0:06] been so kind. You've been so gracious.
[0:09] Hallelujah. Thank you for the old rugged
[0:12] cross, Lord God. Hallelujah. Someday
[0:14] we'll exchange it for a crown, Lord God.
[0:17] Then forever we'll be with you, the one
[0:19] who died for us, Lord God. And you'll
[0:20] lead us to green pastures, still waters,
[0:23] Lord, in that other land, Lord God, the
[0:27] land of the living. Hallelujah.
[0:29] Father, till then God, give us grace and
[0:31] strength. Lord God, keep leading us
[0:33] along. Lord God,
[0:36] some through the waters, I was thinking
[0:37] like Moses took them through the waters.
[0:39] Some through the floods like Noah, some
[0:42] through the fire like Shadrach, Meshach,
[0:44] and Abedneo, but yet all come through
[0:46] the blood.
[0:48] Thank you, Lord, for the blood of the
[0:49] sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Lord God, we
[0:52] come through that blood today, Lord God.
[0:55] realizing our littleness. Lord, how
[0:57] small we are, but yet, Lord, we're your
[1:00] children. The Bible said you loved us
[1:02] and washed us from our sins in your own
[1:05] blood. Thank you, Lord, for being so
[1:07] faithful, providing us, Lord,
[1:10] forgiveness, providing us, Lord, power,
[1:12] giving us of your own spirit, Lord God,
[1:16] Christ in us, the hope of glory. So,
[1:18] Father, take this day, Lord. Use it for
[1:19] your glory. We're just yielding to you,
[1:21] Lord God. Bless each and every heart
[1:23] especially our faithful saints who came
[1:25] out to the house of the Lord today.
[1:26] Minister to them I pray be with our
[1:29] saints that are traveling Lord God
[1:30] couldn't be with us today Lord remember
[1:32] them Lord Jesus and meet their spiritual
[1:35] needs we pray and God will be happy when
[1:38] we leave this place because of your
[1:40] presence in Jesus Christ's name saint
[1:43] said. Amen. Let's take our Bibles here.
[1:46] Let's go to uh 1 Corinthians chapter 13
[1:48] verse4.
[1:50] I would like to finish this chapter
[1:52] today, Lord willing.
[2:04] I'll try to preach maybe an hour this
[2:06] morning here by God's grace. I got a my
[2:07] throat's uh been a very sore throat this
[2:09] week.
[2:12] But uh for the second service uh not
[2:16] sure which way we'll go, but uh I did
[2:18] have an email from a brother in
[2:20] Tennessee said he's going to try to
[2:21] attend with his little family. I guess
[2:22] he's got one. He's got a son and a wife
[2:25] and he said he felt the Lord put it on
[2:27] his heart to come to the 3M service. So
[2:30] uh I'm a little nervous about that. You
[2:33] know, when someone uh says that God told
[2:35] them to come to your church to hear from
[2:37] you, that makes me a little nervous. So,
[2:39] uh, but, uh, not sure if I'll preach or
[2:42] do a kids Bible study yet. I'll just
[2:44] have to wait on the Lord and kind of see
[2:45] how I feel that of the Holy Spirit. But,
[2:48] uh, and then maybe they won't come. Who
[2:50] knows, you know, we never know. But, uh,
[2:52] we just want to be ready to, uh, do the
[2:55] Lord's will. So, 1 Corinthians 13, uh,
[2:58] 4,
[3:02] I'll read four, five, six, then we can
[3:04] all read uh, verse 7 here. Charity
[3:07] suffereth long and is kind. Charity
[3:10] envieth not. Charity vaunteth not itself
[3:13] is not puffed up. Doth not behave itself
[3:17] unseemly. Seketh not her own. Is not
[3:20] easily provoked. Thinkketh no evil.
[3:24] Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoicth
[3:27] in the truth. Let's read verse seven. 1
[3:29] 2 3. Beareth all things. Believeth all
[3:33] things. Hopeeth all things. endureth all
[3:37] things. And I'll say charity never
[3:39] faileth because that's the 16th and
[3:41] final attribute of God's love. May God
[3:44] add his blessing to the reading of his
[3:45] word. You can be seated.
[3:51] So Wednesday we saw how the uh the Lord
[3:54] Jesus manifested all of these. And if we
[3:57] ever uh knew what love was, it was
[4:00] through Jesus Christ. That's the only
[4:01] way we could know love uh on this earth
[4:04] by God's grace. You can switch over Kaia
[4:06] if whenever you're ready.
[4:10] Just again to see where we're at. We're
[4:11] at uh the the point of this letter of
[4:13] charity. He's gone through all their
[4:15] problems and he's on charity now. And
[4:17] what's what's interesting is he doesn't
[4:18] really deal with problems after this.
[4:20] Once he hits charity uh he well he deals
[4:23] with tongues and interpretation, you
[4:24] know, in the next chapter, but then
[4:26] after that he's not really dealing with
[4:28] too much of the problems. So he started
[4:29] with dealing with a lot of their
[4:30] problems in the church and then moves
[4:33] and and shows how charity is the
[4:35] solution to all of it. Love is what the
[4:38] world is hungry for. Praise God. Love is
[4:40] what we have. Hallelujah. And so if
[4:42] people can uh if people really want the
[4:44] love of God, God will send them in here
[4:46] if they live around here. Praise God. Or
[4:48] God will send them to whatever message
[4:50] church there is around the world that
[4:51] has the true baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[4:54] God will send them there if they truly
[4:55] want it. Praise God. But every person
[4:58] will get what they want. Hallelujah.
[5:00] Right? Uh they'll get what they want. If
[5:02] they delight themselves in the Lord,
[5:03] then God will give them desires of their
[5:05] hearts. Hallelujah. Then he'll end with
[5:07] the the certainty of the resurrection
[5:09] and gives his closing greetings.
[5:12] Now, uh years ago, I preached this uh
[5:14] Jose probably remember he was one of my
[5:16] biggest ameners
[5:18] when I preached on all the meanings of
[5:20] the Bible. I think it was like a 17-p
[5:21] part series or something. But Jesus, if
[5:23] we ever saw suffering long, Jesus
[5:25] suffered long. Jesus is kind. Jesus did
[5:28] not envy. He built up others. Uh he did
[5:31] not vaunt up himself. Uh he was not
[5:34] puffed up in pride. He did not behave
[5:37] himself unseemly. He did not seek his
[5:39] own. He sought the father's will. He was
[5:41] not easily provoked. It took a You could
[5:44] not get Jesus provoked. Hallelujah. And
[5:47] he thought no evil.
[5:49] He only thought the word of God. And
[5:50] Wednesday we finish with Jesus did not
[5:52] rejoice in iniquity. In fact, we saw how
[5:54] he condemned the workers of iniquity,
[5:57] but gave grace to those who kept the
[5:58] commands. Hallelujah.
[6:01] And today we'll look at the rest of
[6:02] these, Lord willing, uh, by God's grace.
[6:05] So, I think I said 17, but if I counted,
[6:07] I think it was 16. 16 attributes. So,
[6:11] this just a fresh thought I had. You
[6:12] know, if if anyone could manifest all of
[6:14] these, it would be the Lord Jesus
[6:16] Christ. So, uh, let's keep looking at
[6:18] his life here. Um he says in Matthew 11,
[6:21] this is the one time we can see Jesus
[6:23] rejoice in the Bible. You ever think of
[6:24] that? You know, we're not given many
[6:26] opportunities where we see him happy,
[6:28] rejoicing, we'd say, but this is one for
[6:31] sure where uh Jesus rejoiced.
[6:36] And I think it maybe was the other
[6:37] gospel that records him rejoicing, but
[6:40] uh he said, "But I say unto you that it
[6:41] should be more tolerable for the land of
[6:43] Sodom in the day of judgment than for
[6:46] thee." And we'll look at that here in a
[6:47] moment. But uh Jesus answered and said,
[6:49] "I thank thee, oh father, uh Lord of
[6:52] heaven and earth, because thou hast hid
[6:54] these things from the wise and prudent
[6:57] and hast revealed them unto babes."
[7:01] So in the context, Jesus had just
[7:03] finished rebuking three cities in
[7:05] northern Israel, which we'll look at
[7:06] today, and they'd rejected the message.
[7:10] Um,
[7:12] uh, it's hard and it's hard, it's always
[7:13] been hard for me to grasp that sodomites
[7:16] who would knock on doors in the days of
[7:20] Lot,
[7:21] they'll get less punishment than these
[7:24] cities we're going to look at here
[7:25] today. They would knock on the door and
[7:27] say, "Give us the young men. Give us
[7:29] those men. We want them for our evil
[7:33] purposes." It's just, it's hard to
[7:35] understand, but Jesus said it, so we
[7:37] must accept it. We must recognize that
[7:40] his ways are higher than our ways. His
[7:42] thoughts are greater than our thoughts.
[7:44] &gt;&gt; But this is one time he rejoiced. Jesus
[7:46] rejoiced and said, "Thank you, God, that
[7:48] you've hid it from the wise and prudent,
[7:50] but you revealed it unto babes." How
[7:52] happy that should make us today. Praise
[7:54] God. That we are the very few in this
[7:57] world. We're we're very few of the
[8:00] people that will actually be saved.
[8:01] Hallelujah. And go to heaven because
[8:04] we've received the revelation. And
[8:06] brother Ram said, you know, your church
[8:07] didn't give it to you. Uh, your parents
[8:09] didn't give you it to,
[8:11] &gt;&gt; but the father in heaven gave you the
[8:12] revelation.
[8:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Flesh and blood has not
[8:16] revealed it unto you. No one could give
[8:17] it to you, but you had to love the
[8:19] father, and the father gave you the
[8:21] revelation of his word.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[8:26] &gt;&gt; And uh so here's a little map. Uh you'll
[8:27] see is the furthest north. Betha is uh
[8:32] southoutheast of of Churzan. And then
[8:35] Capertium is almost directly south of
[8:37] Trazan. Uh and I I could be saying these
[8:40] wrong. I'm not from the east. Um I want
[8:44] to real quickly look up that verse where
[8:46] it said Jesus I thought it said he
[8:48] rejoiced in spirit. Am I am I
[8:50] remembering that right? Okay.
[8:53] Yes. Okay. It's Luke. So if you don't if
[8:55] you have your Bible, it's Luke 10:21. In
[8:57] that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit. So I
[9:00] I used a parallel passage that didn't
[9:03] say he rejoiced. just said he thanked
[9:04] God. But here we see he rejoiced. So in
[9:07] in Jesus's happiest moments, he's he's
[9:11] recognizing I'm rejected by most of the
[9:13] people,
[9:14] &gt;&gt; but he rejoices. I'm glad some people
[9:17] receive my message.
[9:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what I can rejoice in
[9:20] today. Uh all many people in Akran maybe
[9:24] or few people in Akran have heard of our
[9:25] church, but I'm thankful that God has
[9:27] given us some that believe it.
[9:28] Hallelujah.
[9:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. out of the few that have heard,
[9:31] you know, or want to hear, I'm glad
[9:33] God's given us a church that rejoices in
[9:35] the message. Hallelujah. The Bible
[9:37] revelations that God's vindicating right
[9:39] now. So Jesus rejoiced in his spirit
[9:43] said, "I thank thee, oh father."
[9:46] Now, what's interesting, you know, is
[9:47] when this is the moment or this is the
[9:49] the context where Jesus saying, "I thank
[9:51] you, Lord." So Jesus had spent what what
[9:54] the research I I did just said he he
[9:57] spent between weeks in these cities or
[9:59] maybe six months or maybe even 24
[10:01] months. The first two years of his
[10:03] ministry, Jesus spent most of his time
[10:05] in northern Israel.
[10:08] And these three cities in particular saw
[10:10] some of his greatest miracles. Now
[10:12] remember the wine, the water was turned
[10:13] to wine in Canaa, right? That was his
[10:16] first miracle.
[10:18] uh the maniac of Gadra with uh we'd say
[10:21] 6,000 demons, whatever it is, legions,
[10:23] however, legions of devils. He was
[10:26] healed there. Uh and all the different
[10:29] uh miracles that these names of these
[10:31] cities bring to our remembrance. You
[10:33] know, he was raised in Nazareth, right?
[10:35] Just a wicked town, wicked uh wicked
[10:38] place to live. He said, "Can anything
[10:40] good come out of Nazareth?" But yet
[10:42] Jesus came out of Nazareth. Praise God.
[10:45] Because God can bring something evil out
[10:47] of something I'm sorry. So God can bring
[10:48] something holy out of something unholy.
[10:50] Hallelujah. Just like your life. Amen.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[10:53] &gt;&gt; And so Jesus said, "These three cities
[10:55] in particular saw uh many mighty works,
[10:58] but yet they did not repent."
[11:02] &gt;&gt; Now, and of course there's always a
[11:04] balance because it seems like God needs
[11:05] a test a witness from every experience
[11:08] of life.
[11:09] Uh, so John the Baptist did no miracles.
[11:12] Yet he was the greatest Old Testament
[11:14] person.
[11:17] &gt;&gt; So we got to keep this, we just want to
[11:18] keep everything balanced. And Jesus
[11:20] said, "You're me, you're more blessed to
[11:22] believe in Jesus if you haven't seen all
[11:24] these miracles."
[11:27] &gt;&gt; I want to read that just because I I
[11:29] want to make did he say more blessed?
[11:31] Was that or is that my own thought? 2029
[11:35] Jesus said, "Thomas, because thou hast
[11:36] believed, thou I'm sorry, thou has seen
[11:39] me, thou hast believed. Blessed are they
[11:42] that have not seen." So there there is a
[11:44] blessing he must be missing out on and
[11:46] yet have believed. Hallelujah. I've, you
[11:49] know, none of us saw brother Brandham,
[11:51] yet we believe that he was sent by Jesus
[11:53] Christ.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So there is there is a
[11:55] blessing for us
[11:56] &gt;&gt; that others don't get, but they they did
[11:59] get a prophet's reward. Hallelujah. If
[12:00] they were with a prophet, they got a
[12:02] prophet's reward.
[12:04] And then also to balance this out, you
[12:06] know, uh Jesus told the parable of
[12:08] Moses, uh I'm sorry, Abraham in
[12:11] Abraham's bosom, and we found that love
[12:13] for the law, love for the word of God
[12:15] will save someone. And yet, you know,
[12:18] miracles would not save people.
[12:22] So, so some people God's going to send
[12:24] miracles to and they don't have to
[12:25] believe them. They just got to believe
[12:26] the word, right?
[12:28] other people God will send lots of
[12:30] miracles to and that that ought to be
[12:32] enough to get them to believe.
[12:34] &gt;&gt; So you we basically got to look at uh
[12:36] what has God done for us? What has God
[12:38] shown us? And then we're accountable to
[12:41] what God has shown us.
[12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:43] &gt;&gt; So Jesus said the witnesses souls were
[12:46] accountable for the mighty works that he
[12:48] did because he did so many mighty works
[12:51] in uh Galilee. We'd say we sing that
[12:53] song, I love that man from Galilee.
[12:56] &gt;&gt; You know why they sing that? Because he
[12:57] did Jesus did the majority of his
[12:59] miracles in northern Israel. That's why
[13:02] they loved him so much. It was all so
[13:04] many supernatural many mighty works.
[13:08] And remember when he after he did all
[13:10] these mighty works, he upgraded them
[13:13] because they didn't repent.
[13:17] So this these group of cities here in
[13:19] northern Israel should have repented
[13:21] because they saw so many miracles.
[13:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[13:25] So, you know, I would say the people
[13:27] around brother Random's time, they
[13:28] they're probably they probably saw so
[13:30] many miracles that God probably required
[13:32] that they repent because of all the
[13:34] miracles that they saw.
[13:37] But then like in other cases, you might
[13:38] not have as many miracles. Uh and God
[13:41] just wants you to believe the word of
[13:42] God just based upon what the word of God
[13:44] says. You should believe the word of
[13:45] God.
[13:46] &gt;&gt; You might not have saw as many miracles,
[13:48] but God wants you just to love the word.
[13:50] Believe the word
[13:51] &gt;&gt; and God will make you an overcomer.
[13:53] &gt;&gt; That's right. But cher and uh capernium
[13:56] and besada they should have believed and
[13:59] they should have overcame because of all
[14:00] the miracles that they saw around them.
[14:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[14:05] &gt;&gt; Now uh there's at least six miracles
[14:07] recorded in capernium
[14:10] uh the healing of the centurion
[14:11] servants. That's when the centurion said
[14:13] Jesus just speak the word of God and
[14:16] your ser and my servant will be made
[14:17] well.
[14:18] &gt;&gt; So Jesus said my I've not seen such
[14:20] great faith of this in all of Israel.
[14:23] So this was a land of great faith for
[14:25] the believers.
[14:27] &gt;&gt; Uh Peter's mother-in-law was healed in
[14:29] Capernaum. Remember she had the fever
[14:31] and he just touched her and instantly
[14:33] she jumped up and started serving
[14:34] people.
[14:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's why you should
[14:37] want a miracle of healing so God can
[14:39] heal your body so you can go help other
[14:40] people as well.
[14:42] &gt;&gt; That's why we should want to be healed.
[14:44] And then Jesus even cast out a demon in
[14:47] their synagogue. Remember they brought
[14:48] the man in there and he was foaming at
[14:49] the mouth and Jesus rebuked the spirit.
[14:51] So they saw a demon cast out right in
[14:54] their church.
[14:55] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "You should repent if
[14:57] you've seen that."
[15:00] &gt;&gt; Also, uh this was the city where they
[15:02] lowered the the paralyzed man through
[15:04] the roof. And Jesus said, "I forgive
[15:06] your sins, but I'm going to do better
[15:07] than that. I'm going to raise you from
[15:09] your uh raise you from your paralyzed
[15:11] condition. Take up your bed and walk."
[15:13] Amen.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That was done there.
[15:18] The noble man's son was healed as well.
[15:20] Oh, and I don't remember that one, too.
[15:21] So, let me turn to that one. John 4:46.
[15:24] Just to kind of give a little brother
[15:26] Ram called a polish up. Let me polish up
[15:28] on this one here. Uh, by God's grace.
[15:38] Okay. So, the son was at the point of
[15:40] death in verse 47. And Jesus said,
[15:42] "Except ye see signs and miracles, ye
[15:44] will not believe." The nobleman said
[15:45] unto him, "Sir, come down, my child
[15:47] die." And he said, 'Go thy way, thy son
[15:50] liveth.' And the man believed the word
[15:53] that Jesus spoken unto him and went his
[15:55] way. Hallelujah.
[15:57] &gt;&gt; And we find out later in verse 52, it
[15:59] was a fever. The boy was at a point of
[16:02] death because of the fever. And Jesus
[16:03] said, "Just go. You're going to find
[16:05] him. Just believe the word of God." So
[16:07] this was done. This would have been
[16:09] noised abroad uh by all their friends
[16:11] and companions.
[16:13] And then I love these that multitudes
[16:15] were healed at evening time here in
[16:18] Capernaum. So the Bible said just
[16:21] multitudes. It's like everybody was
[16:22] getting healed. Hallelujah. Faith was
[16:24] present to heal faith. This person was
[16:26] believing. That person was believing.
[16:28] Everybody was believing. But yet the
[16:30] city the heart of the cities of I'm
[16:32] sorry the the hearts of the people in
[16:33] the city did not change and the city did
[16:36] not fully accept Jesus Christ.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; So it'd be better I'm sorry. It' be less
[16:41] tolerable for the sodomites than for
[16:42] that city.
[16:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[16:46] &gt;&gt; Now, Besada
[16:48] has at least four uh miracles that were
[16:51] manifested. Uh the blind man was healed.
[16:54] Hallelujah. See, not every city got a
[16:56] blind man healed, but Bessa did. They
[16:59] saw 5,000 fed. Hallelujah. The brother
[17:03] Ram said God took a creation and just
[17:05] multiplied the creation.
[17:07] Right? But then God said or brother Ram
[17:09] said there's greater miracles than that
[17:10] where you don't even have anything to
[17:12] multiply. You just speak it and it comes
[17:13] into existence like Moses speaking those
[17:17] uh plagues into existence and brother
[17:18] Ram speaking squirrels into existence.
[17:20] &gt;&gt; Right? That's even greater when you
[17:22] start with nothing and you just speak
[17:23] and God creates something. But that's
[17:26] still a great mighty miracle. Jesus
[17:28] walked on water toward Bethadas. That
[17:31] was going towards Bethedada. And then
[17:33] there were many local healings in the
[17:35] surrounding plains. uh in Janisera, I
[17:39] think the woman of Jesus was the one
[17:40] with the blood issue if I'm not mistaken
[17:42] and touched uh Jesus
[17:45] uh if I'm not mistaken by God's grace.
[17:49] Now Galilee on the Sea of Galilee itself
[17:52] there was miracles that they saw. They
[17:53] saw the the calming of the storm. Jesus
[17:56] walked on water, the miraculous catching
[17:58] of the all the fish that was right there
[18:00] on the Sea of Galilee. This place was
[18:02] hopping with miracles.
[18:04] And then they saw the second miraculous
[18:06] catch of fish after the resurrection.
[18:09] And they saw where the boat instantly,
[18:10] now the disciples would have saw this,
[18:12] the boat instantly got to the shore from
[18:14] being out in the middle of the Sea of
[18:15] Galilee in the midst of the storm. As
[18:17] soon as Jesus got into it, then he
[18:19] transported the whole boat right there
[18:21] to shore.
[18:23] So Jesus says, "This generation's
[18:25] required to believe all of it. If not,
[18:27] it'll be worse than the judgment on
[18:29] Sodom and Gomorrah." My now church, this
[18:33] boils down to this. Why you preaching
[18:34] this, Brother Jesse? Because it's in the
[18:35] Bible. Amen.
[18:37] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says we must believe what
[18:40] God has shown us.
[18:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[18:42] &gt;&gt; So, has God shown us all kinds of
[18:43] miracles where we're required to believe
[18:45] because of that or have we seen less
[18:47] miracles and God wants us to believe the
[18:50] word of God?
[18:53] &gt;&gt; You only you can answer that by God's
[18:55] grace. I mean, I could guess, but only
[18:57] you can answer that. How many miracles
[18:58] have you seen? But the but the gospel
[19:01] itself always has miracles.
[19:04] And the Bible said we must not neglect
[19:07] the salvation of the gospel of Jesus
[19:09] Christ.
[19:10] &gt;&gt; The Bible said we ought to give the most
[19:12] earnest heed. So we've got to pay most
[19:14] attention in our life to the gospel of
[19:16] Jesus Christ. Don't let anything get
[19:18] more attention
[19:20] &gt;&gt; than the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[19:22] &gt;&gt; Right? We've seen it over the years.
[19:24] People let family get more attention
[19:25] than the gospel.
[19:27] &gt;&gt; Family becomes more important than
[19:28] coming to church
[19:29] &gt;&gt; or reading your Bible in your home.
[19:32] &gt;&gt; Right? Or money. money becomes more
[19:33] important than the gospel. Like getting
[19:35] enough money,
[19:37] &gt;&gt; then you can't come to Wednesday night
[19:38] and you can't come to Sunday night and
[19:40] because money is more important than the
[19:42] gospel of Jesus Christ. We just have to
[19:45] constantly watch our lives and make sure
[19:47] we're giving most of our attention to
[19:49] the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; We don't want these blessings to slip
[19:53] out of our hands. Think about that. God
[19:55] has placed blessings in your hand. Don't
[19:57] let it slip out of your hand.
[19:59] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't drop it. Don't lay it aside.
[20:01] Hold on to the gospel.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; Because if the word spoken by angels was
[20:05] steadfast and every transgression and
[20:09] disobedience receive a just recompense
[20:11] of reward, how shall we escape if we
[20:15] neglect so great salvation?
[20:18] Hallelujah. Each one of us are
[20:20] responsible to the word of God that
[20:23] we've heard. Do not let it slip away.
[20:25] Give the most earnest heed that we can
[20:27] to it. Amen.
[20:30] &gt;&gt; See, because at first it was began to be
[20:32] spoken by the Lord, and it was confirmed
[20:35] unto us by them that heard him, the
[20:36] apostles. God also bearing them witness
[20:39] both with signs and wonders and with
[20:41] diverse miracles and gifts of the Holy
[20:42] Ghost according to his own will. And I
[20:45] can say the same for me. When I came to
[20:47] this message, I started seeing way more
[20:48] miracles than what I did in
[20:50] denomination.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; In other words, God gave me witness that
[20:55] this message was right.
[20:57] Hallelujah.
[20:59] &gt;&gt; And so uh we cannot let these things
[21:02] slip. We must give the more earnest heed
[21:04] to them.
[21:07] &gt;&gt; Now let's get to the next one. So Jesus
[21:08] rejoice in truth. Right? Now let's go to
[21:10] Jesus bears all things. And if he can
[21:14] bear it church, we can bear our trials.
[21:16] Hallelujah.
[21:18] &gt;&gt; Uh you'll be familiar with this. And in
[21:20] this case, G uh s or church, Jesus is
[21:23] bearing with you and I. If Jesus bears
[21:25] with us despite our weaknesses, then we
[21:28] should bear with one another. The Bible
[21:30] said, "Bear one another's burdens."
[21:33] &gt;&gt; This is in the parable of the unjust
[21:35] judge. And the Lord said, "Hear what the
[21:38] unjudged or unjust judge saith. Shall
[21:41] not God avenge his own elect, which cry
[21:43] day and night unto him, though he bear
[21:46] long with them?"
[21:49] &gt;&gt; So, this just struck me. God is bearing
[21:52] long with us.
[21:54] God is having patience with you and I.
[21:58] &gt;&gt; But Jesus says, "I tell you, God will
[22:00] avenge them speedily." So, in other
[22:02] words, God's working quickly to answer
[22:04] your prayers, but it can't be in your
[22:06] idea of quickly. It's in God's idea of
[22:08] quickly.
[22:09] &gt;&gt; It's at God's speed. Amen. Not our
[22:13] speed. It's at God's speed. We can't
[22:15] make Jesus a liar, right? Jesus is not
[22:17] lying. God's going to answer your
[22:19] request speedily, but not in your time,
[22:21] in his time. That's right.
[22:23] &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, when the son of man
[22:25] cometh, shall he find faith on the
[22:26] earth. So, in other words, Jesus saying,
[22:29] we wrestle with faith, right? We wrestle
[22:31] with believing. Brother Ram said, you
[22:32] know, uh we and I just read the quote a
[22:35] few uh months ago, but uh brother Ram
[22:37] said, "We have trouble believing from
[22:39] Sunday to Wednesday.
[22:41] Like, we'll we'll be so fired up Sunday
[22:43] when Wednesday comes around." Some of us
[22:45] just barely, and me included, sometimes
[22:46] we just walk in here just trying to get
[22:48] through the battle,
[22:50] &gt;&gt; right? Uh, and then what about believing
[22:52] from one week, one Sunday to the next
[22:54] Sunday?
[22:55] &gt;&gt; We were just rejoicing last week with
[22:57] ministry from Kentucky. Whoa, wasn't it
[22:59] wonderful? But do we have the same zeal
[23:01] that we had last Sunday?
[23:03] &gt;&gt; Or is God bearing bearing with us
[23:06] despite our trials?
[23:09] Hallelujah.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:12] So, will Jesus bear with us? Yes, he'll
[23:14] bear with us. Praise God. Because that's
[23:16] what love does. Love bears with us. And
[23:19] so what does the word bear mean? This is
[23:21] the one that I thought was most
[23:23] helpful. It's patient in bearing our
[23:27] offenses. So Jesus is very patient with
[23:30] all the offenses that we have, yet he
[23:33] still answers our prayers.
[23:35] &gt;&gt; I like this church. Even though we
[23:38] injure other people, we have offenses,
[23:39] we offend people, Jesus is mild and he's
[23:43] slow to punish us.
[23:45] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says, right?
[23:47] though he bear long with them.
[23:50] Hallelujah.
[23:54] And I guess uh in the context remember
[23:56] the the unjust judge was bearing long
[23:58] with the woman who kept asking. He was
[24:00] bearing with her, right? And so God is
[24:03] bearing with us despite our offenses. He
[24:06] still answers our prayers speedily.
[24:08] &gt;&gt; Speedily. And I need that today. I need
[24:11] I need God to give me grace, right? I I
[24:13] I want I want uh I want patience. I want
[24:16] longsuffering to believe that he's going
[24:17] to answer my prayers speedily.
[24:21] &gt;&gt; And every time, church, every time I uh
[24:23] well, you've probably seen it, but every
[24:25] time I go to this slide and I uh cross
[24:27] one off, what do I say? I say, "Let's
[24:28] give God a round of applause." Amen.
[24:31] Because God answers something speedily,
[24:34] &gt;&gt; right? With Fabrigio and Muriel and
[24:37] everything like that, he's answered
[24:38] something speedily. So, we want to give
[24:40] him praise. Hallelujah. every time he
[24:41] answers a prayer request.
[24:45] Jesus bears all things. Jesus endured
[24:48] his
[24:50] disciples arguing about who is greatest.
[24:55] And he said he he he hears them arguing.
[24:58] He goes and gets a child and sets the
[25:00] child right by him. So this is a good
[25:03] lesson. Whenever someone's talking about
[25:04] how great they are, we should look at a
[25:06] go go go look at a child. Let's look at
[25:08] uh let's look at Eden this morning or
[25:10] let's look at uh uh Michelle, you know,
[25:12] let's let's look at Zion this morning or
[25:14] Genevieve. You know, when when when we
[25:17] think how great we are, let's put our
[25:19] eyes on a little child. And that that
[25:22] should remind us who's great among us.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Whosoever shall receive
[25:27] this child in my name receives me.
[25:31] Whosoever shall receive me receiveth him
[25:33] that sent me. For he that is least among
[25:36] you all, the same shall be great.
[25:41] And this kind of goes with what we
[25:43] preached about, right, in chapter 12.
[25:45] The foot is the least esteem, right?
[25:47] It's sweaty. It's dirty. Is no one's
[25:49] ever thinking, "Wow, I got really great
[25:51] feet." Or, "Well, my feet look great
[25:53] today." You know, we want to make sure
[25:55] our face looks clean and everything like
[25:57] that, which we ought to. But in other
[25:59] words, the emphasis was we give honor to
[26:02] certain body parts. We don't give as
[26:04] much honor to other body parts. And
[26:06] those that are less honored by us, God
[26:08] will give them more honor. So God will
[26:11] give the people who have the attitude
[26:13] most like a child, they'll be called
[26:15] greatest in the kingdom of God.
[26:18] Now church, if you go study a little
[26:20] bit, why were the children called the
[26:21] least in the days of Jesus?
[26:24] Well, their uh children's uh lives
[26:26] didn't last very long.
[26:30] 50% of kids died by the time they were
[26:32] 10 in the days of Jesus according to
[26:35] what history says. That's not very much.
[26:38] Half the children died,
[26:40] right? Because of all the conditions,
[26:42] right? You had, of course, you had evil
[26:45] leaders, you know, like Herod that would
[26:46] kill the children, right? Pharaoh. Um,
[26:49] but on top of that, you had all the
[26:50] sickness, right? All the disease.
[26:54] And so, in order to be important in the
[26:56] days of Jesus, you had to be older.
[26:58] wiser, wealthy, and yet to be more
[27:02] honorable.
[27:03] And so all the apostles arguing, "Oh,
[27:05] we're greater. We're greater." And
[27:06] Jesus, you know, we're older, you know,
[27:10] we we we're fishermen, we're tax
[27:11] collectors, all these things. And Jesus
[27:14] go gets a he gets a child. And he said,
[27:17] "This is what the kingdom of God is
[27:19] like,
[27:20] &gt;&gt; a child. The le the people you think are
[27:23] the least are actually the greatest."
[27:28] Remember his own disciples tried to turn
[27:30] away the parents from bringing their
[27:32] children to Jesus. They rebuked them. It
[27:36] would be like me saying, "Don't bring
[27:37] the kids up in the prayer line. Don't
[27:40] come and tell me to pray for your kids.
[27:43] We got bigger problems than that."
[27:46] That's but it would be the same thing.
[27:48] And Jesus said, "Let them come to me."
[27:51] Right? They're the least uh uh they're
[27:53] the least esteemed. No one thinks
[27:56] they're important. We think importance
[27:58] is physical strength and money and your
[28:00] age and how much you know.
[28:03] And Jesus says it's not that. It's not
[28:05] in pride, right? It's not in anything
[28:06] you can do. Uh but it's in being humble
[28:09] before the Lord, just believing God's
[28:10] word.
[28:15] &gt;&gt; So Jesus bears all things. He bears with
[28:17] his apostles who think they're great,
[28:19] right?
[28:20] Jesus hoped all things. And uh the Bible
[28:23] said all Jesus said all that the father
[28:25] giveth me shall come to me and him that
[28:27] cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.
[28:32] So this is Jesus's great hope. All that
[28:34] want to come to me will come and and no
[28:37] one will be able to pluck them out of my
[28:38] father's hand.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; See he could hope. He hoped for all
[28:42] things. And just remember church Jesus
[28:45] prayed for you in John 17. Uh if you
[28:48] remember this
[28:50] Jesus said and now I'm no more in the
[28:52] world but these are in the world and I
[28:55] come to thee holy father keep through
[28:58] thine own name that's the authority keep
[29:00] through the authority of the lord those
[29:02] whom thou hast given me that they may be
[29:04] one as we are. So Jesus said
[29:09] he prayed and said god keep them through
[29:12] uni unity by god's grace.
[29:15] So think about that. People who fall
[29:17] away from the message, people who fall
[29:18] away from the church, they do so because
[29:21] they're divided and they don't have the
[29:22] same unity that we have.
[29:26] &gt;&gt; Okay? That was Jesus' prayer. Your main
[29:28] goal should be to be unified in love
[29:31] with everyone in the church.
[29:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:34] &gt;&gt; Because Satan's trying to divide you and
[29:36] get you out of the church,
[29:37] &gt;&gt; the true church of God. We're talking
[29:39] about
[29:40] &gt;&gt; the body of Christ, right? That was his
[29:43] prayer. He prayed that God keep them
[29:46] that they can be one that they can be
[29:48] unified. But Satan loves to divide. He
[29:50] loves to steal, kill, and destroy.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; But greater is he that's in us than he
[29:56] that's in the world. Hallelujah.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus says, "I've given them thy word,
[30:01] Father, and the world hates them because
[30:04] they are not of the world, even as I am
[30:06] not of the world.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; I pray not that thou shouldest take them
[30:10] out of the world." So church, we
[30:12] shouldn't hope that we could just go to
[30:13] heaven, right? Despite our trials. I
[30:15] know it's normal. Elijah felt like that,
[30:17] right? He said, "God, just take me
[30:18] home."
[30:20] But we should remember Jesus wants us in
[30:23] the world uh to overcome.
[30:26] &gt;&gt; But he did pray, "God, keep them from
[30:29] the evil."
[30:31] &gt;&gt; Right?
[30:32] &gt;&gt; That's like the Lord's prayer where he
[30:34] said, "Lord, lead me not into
[30:35] temptation, but deliver me from evil."
[30:39] So friend, be encouraged. The reason you
[30:41] don't have more evil in your life is
[30:43] because Jesus prayed for you.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; That's the reason. Think about that. You
[30:48] hear about evil in that person's life
[30:49] and you see my the evil in that life.
[30:51] Like I just a few months ago, I read
[30:53] this awful situation. There was this
[30:56] rich couple. They were rich and a man
[30:58] and a woman. They're they're newly
[30:59] married. They're driving so fast in the
[31:02] Canadian highways. A moose comes out and
[31:04] hits their car. and the moose's antlers
[31:07] killed the woman
[31:09] and she was on Instagram or had all
[31:11] these followings you know she was like a
[31:13] model or something like that
[31:15] &gt;&gt; and it was just instantly church that's
[31:17] an evil thing
[31:19] &gt;&gt; but think God has kept us from evil like
[31:22] that
[31:23] &gt;&gt; and that's a woman who basically
[31:25] accepted worship from all these men you
[31:27] know if you go back and look at it you
[31:28] know and this man's a millionaire
[31:30] they're living this extremely uh
[31:33] luxurious life and you know God is the
[31:36] judge of all these souls.
[31:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; And I I don't know the condition of
[31:40] every heart, but I just want you to see
[31:42] there's so much evil
[31:44] &gt;&gt; that goes on. But Jesus prayed, "God,
[31:46] keep them from the evil."
[31:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:50] &gt;&gt; And look at this, church. This is
[31:52] beautiful. Let this encourage you today.
[31:54] They are not of the world. You are not
[31:56] of the world today.
[31:58] &gt;&gt; Jesus said so. Hallelujah. Well, if I'm
[32:00] not of this world, brother Mercy, where
[32:02] am I from? I'm from heaven. Hallelujah.
[32:05] You are from heaven.
[32:07] &gt;&gt; You're not a part of really of America.
[32:09] You're not really a part of that. You're
[32:10] a part of a better kingdom than that.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; A kingdom that cannot be moved.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; The United States has moved. China's
[32:18] moved and Russia's moved on these
[32:20] things. They get moved, you know, in
[32:21] their stances. But we never get moved
[32:23] because we're standing on the rock of
[32:25] ages.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; And Jesus prays, "Sanctify them through
[32:30] thy truth. Thy word is truth.
[32:34] So if you want to be sanctified, stay in
[32:37] the word of God.
[32:38] &gt;&gt; It will keep you. Sanctified means set
[32:41] apart, right? Uh reserved for the
[32:43] service of the Lord. Stay in the word of
[32:46] God. The truth will keep you set apart
[32:48] for God's purpose.
[32:54] Now he continues to pray. This is a
[32:56] beautiful prayer.
[32:59] I'll just say like this. Nobody could
[33:00] pray like Jesus. Hallelujah. that was
[33:02] God in flesh.
[33:05] Neither pray I for these alone, speaking
[33:07] of his apostles, but for them also which
[33:09] shall believe on me through their word.
[33:13] Now, that's where he prayed for you and
[33:14] I. We have heard on Jesus because of
[33:18] Peter's preaching, because of uh
[33:21] Matthew, Mark, right? all all the saints
[33:24] down through the ages, Bartholomew,
[33:25] Philip, hallelujah, uh James, John, all
[33:29] these all these faithful apostles, we've
[33:32] heard their word. Praise God.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; And Jesus prayed for us. Hallelujah.
[33:38] What did he pray, church? That we would
[33:40] all be one.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; So this is why unity is so important
[33:45] because Satan seeks to divide and
[33:47] conquer. Conquer the leoty, right?
[33:50] Nicicoleism is conquering the leoty.
[33:53] That's
[33:53] &gt;&gt; right.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; Dividing them from the preachers, right?
[33:56] Putting all the holiness on the in the
[33:58] Catholics in the Catholics way in on the
[34:00] priest, right? But in churches, putting
[34:03] it all on the preachers. But I just read
[34:05] it this morning. Uh brother Ram said
[34:07] there's no holiness in the church except
[34:09] God's in the church.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; He said there's no holy man. It's the
[34:13] Holy Ghost in the man.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost in the church.
[34:17] Praise God. So if you've got the Holy
[34:19] Ghost, you're holy. I Amen. Just as holy
[34:21] as anybody else who's got the Holy
[34:23] Ghost.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus prayed, "God, let them be. Let
[34:30] them be one
[34:33] as thou, Father, art in me and I in
[34:35] thee, that they also may be one in us."
[34:39] So that's the same spirit. Jesus wants
[34:42] the same spirit in the church that he
[34:44] and the father shares
[34:47] that the world may believe that thou
[34:50] hast sent me. Hallelujah. And that's how
[34:52] the world will know. I don't know how to
[34:54] fully explain this, but that's how the
[34:56] world will know that Jesus is real
[34:58] because of our love for each other.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus says.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; And I remember I had that one time
[35:05] somebody said, "You go to church twice
[35:07] on Sunday." And I said, "Yeah, I just
[35:10] love those people. That's what that was
[35:12] my answer. And they were just blown
[35:13] away. A lot of a lot of Catholics just
[35:15] like to go on Saturday night so they
[35:16] don't have to go on Sunday, right? Just
[35:19] what I'll just go Saturday night and I
[35:21] got I don't got to go Sunday. I can work
[35:22] on Sunday. I can do whatever I want on
[35:24] Sunday.
[35:26] Oh yeah. And the qu the question was I
[35:27] mean they're like and you have a small
[35:29] church and you preach to the same people
[35:32] twice on Sunday. Like it's not a whole
[35:33] another group of people. No, it's the
[35:35] same people. They must really love God.
[35:39] They do love God. Hallelujah. It's a
[35:42] shock to them.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; He keeps praying, "Father, I will that
[35:47] they also whom thou has given me be with
[35:50] me where I am." Isn't that beautiful?
[35:51] Jesus wanted to be with you,
[35:54] &gt;&gt; that they may behold my glory. Amen.
[35:57] Which thou has given me, for thou lovest
[35:59] me before the foundation of the world.
[36:01] Oh righteous father, the world hath not
[36:04] known thee, but I've known thee, and
[36:07] these have known thee, or have known
[36:10] that thou hast sent me, and I have
[36:13] declared. So here's the end of the
[36:14] chapter, church. Here's his last prayer
[36:15] before he goes to be arrested.
[36:18] and I have declared unto them thy name,
[36:21] and will declare it, that the love or
[36:24] the charity wherewith thou hast loved me
[36:28] may be in them, and I in them. So he
[36:33] closes his prayer
[36:36] by asking, God, yet let your love that's
[36:39] in me be in your people.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; So no wonder the Bible said charity is
[36:46] the greatest of all the gifts.
[36:48] Jesus's last prayer before he's arrested
[36:52] is, "God, give them the love that you
[36:54] and I have, Father."
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[37:00] Next, Jesus endured all things. The
[37:03] Bible said we should look to Jesus, the
[37:05] author and finisher of our faith,
[37:08] who for the joy that was set before him
[37:10] endured the cross, despising the shame,
[37:12] and is sat down at the right hand of the
[37:14] throne of God.
[37:16] For consider him that endured such
[37:19] contradiction of sinners against
[37:22] himself,
[37:25] lest ye be weary and faint in your
[37:27] minds. You have not resisted unto blood,
[37:30] striving against sin. Hallelujah. So see
[37:34] the same word endure. Jesus endured all
[37:37] things. What did he endure? He endured
[37:40] people that contradicted himself.
[37:43] So you and I must endure, people who
[37:46] contradict our Bible beliefs.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; We just got to get used to that. Most
[37:52] people you're going to come in contact
[37:54] with contradict you.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; They don't like you. They don't agree
[37:58] with what you say. They don't believe
[38:00] what you believe. But you must endure
[38:02] them
[38:03] &gt;&gt; because that's what Jesus did,
[38:06] &gt;&gt; right? It's just kind of like when I do
[38:08] the YouTube comments. Like I just expect
[38:10] most people are going to be
[38:11] contradicting me, which it's about a
[38:13] 50-50 split.
[38:15] But the same is true whoever you talk to
[38:18] at school, right, Brother Patrick? Most
[38:20] people are going to contradict what you
[38:21] believe.
[38:23] But the Bible said you can handle it.
[38:25] Just look to Jesus.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what he did. The Bible said
[38:30] look to Jesus and then you can you can
[38:32] deal with all these people that
[38:34] contradict you.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:36] because that's what Jesus did. You've
[38:39] got to resist them. Don't give into
[38:40] them. Resist them like Jesus resisted
[38:43] their lies and all their traps and their
[38:46] deception uh and all the all the the
[38:49] badgering brother called in the church
[38:51] age book. They just badgered him. You
[38:54] can endure that by looking unto Jesus.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said you could endure
[39:01] physical pain as well. The Bible said in
[39:03] agony he prayed more earnestly and his
[39:06] sweat was as it were great drops of
[39:08] blood falling down to the ground. So
[39:12] whatever sickness God could allow like
[39:15] in the days of brother Ram tuberculosis
[39:16] was an awful sickness. Uh today it's
[39:20] more like cancer.
[39:22] You know painful sicknesses. It doesn't
[39:24] matter whatever you what do you ever you
[39:26] battle you can endure it because Jesus
[39:29] endured all things for your sake.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:34] Jesus went through the agony of the
[39:36] cross. And if if he endured the agony,
[39:39] you can endure all things as well.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; Because you have to know, you won't have
[39:43] a trial that's too hard for you to
[39:45] handle.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; He won't give you something that you
[39:47] can't endure.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; Remember this. Uh Jesus had depression
[39:53] that would kill a person. No one No one
[39:56] had depression like Jesus. You say,
[39:58] "Boy, I've been really depressed." you
[40:00] that can't touch what Jesus went
[40:01] through.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Well, I've really been defeated. That's
[40:04] nothing compared to what Jesus went
[40:06] through.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; The Bible says it. He began to be
[40:09] sorrowful and very heavy. Now, very
[40:11] heavy. I'll show you the Greek
[40:12] definition.
[40:15] So Jesus when he was praying had such a
[40:17] heaviness. It was just weighing him
[40:19] down. So much so that blood would come
[40:21] out of his his forehead. That's the
[40:24] heaviness that was on him. What was it?
[40:26] It was your sin. It was my sin.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; The weight of the world came on Jesus's
[40:32] shoulders.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; And it was such a heavy weight to pay
[40:35] for all of your sins, my sins, past
[40:38] sins, future sins that it caused blood
[40:41] to come out of his face
[40:43] &gt;&gt; and it caused him to be so depressed.
[40:45] But he endured it. And so God asked us
[40:48] to endure our trials.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Don't forget Jesus. Look to Jesus. If he
[40:53] endured it, you can endure your trials.
[40:56] Amen.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; So this is what I mean. I found this
[40:59] years ago. Very heavy means to be full
[41:02] of heaviness.
[41:04] It's great distress and anguish. This is
[41:07] the strongest of the three words in the
[41:09] New Testament for depression.
[41:13] So no one has ever been as depressed as
[41:16] Jesus Christ. Yet he overcame it because
[41:19] he focused on the joy that was before
[41:22] him. Amen.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; It didn't it didn't say he had the joy
[41:25] going through the the the beatings,
[41:27] &gt;&gt; but the joy was before him.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; So, if you're battling depression, if
[41:32] you're battling discouragement, yeah, of
[41:34] course you won't feel joy, but look to
[41:36] the joy that you'll receive.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; Have hope that you will have joy again.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; And understand, I can look to Jesus. I
[41:46] can endure this because Jesus endured
[41:48] it.
[41:51] Hallelujah.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; So, be encouraged. You know, if you know
[41:54] somebody who's battling depression,
[41:55] maybe take this verse to them and say,
[41:56] "You know what? I understand you're
[41:58] struggling, but did you know Jesus
[42:00] battled depression and he overcame it?"
[42:03] Praise God. He had such depression he
[42:06] would sweat drops of blood.
[42:09] None of us have been like that. We get
[42:10] depressed because we don't have this or
[42:11] we don't have that or don't have that or
[42:14] there are some serious causes, you know,
[42:16] of trauma and things like that. And I'm
[42:18] not talking about that. I'm talking
[42:20] about things that like for most of us,
[42:22] you know, our depression, I imagine,
[42:24] wouldn't be as great as other people
[42:25] who've experienced lots of trauma.
[42:29] But there are exceptions, of course.
[42:32] And this is what I want you to remember,
[42:33] church. You know, no matter what you
[42:34] face, Jesus is here. The spirit of God
[42:38] is here to bring good tidings to the
[42:41] humble.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; In other words, God's going to bring you
[42:44] good news today because you're the
[42:45] humble people.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:48] I love this. Jesus was sent to bind up
[42:50] the brokenhearted. In other words, if
[42:52] you got a broken heart and you feel like
[42:53] all the pieces are broken, Jesus is
[42:55] going to come and gather up those pieces
[42:57] and put them back together.
[42:59] He's going to put your put your life
[43:01] back together. Hallelujah.
[43:03] He's going to proclaim liberty to the
[43:05] captives. Well, I feel captive, Brother
[43:07] Jesse. I feel enslaved. Jesus came to
[43:10] bring you liberty.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; The spirit of the Lord does that.
[43:15] Well, brother Jesse, I feel like I'm in
[43:17] prison. I'm bound up. Jesus is coming to
[43:20] open up that prison.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; That's what the spirit of God does.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, Brother Jesse, I'm
[43:27] mourning. I'm I'm so sad. He's here to
[43:30] comfort all your mourning.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; You know, you might say, uh, I feel like
[43:40] I'm laying in the ashes. Like we heard
[43:41] like with Job, right? laying in the
[43:43] ashes. He'll give you beauty for those
[43:45] ashes. So in ashes, right, you're all
[43:47] dirty. So he's he's Jesus will say, "Get
[43:50] out of those ashes. Let me wash you.
[43:52] I'll make you clean. I'll make you
[43:53] beautiful again."
[43:56] &gt;&gt; He'll give you joy instead of mourning.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; He'll bring back the joy of your
[44:01] salvation.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; See, now here's how you know you're
[44:05] depressed. You can't praise God like you
[44:07] want to.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; But when Jesus takes away your
[44:09] depression, now you can praise God.
[44:12] really say, "Thank you, Jesus. Y'all,
[44:14] you're so good. You're so holy. You've
[44:16] done so much in my life. Hallelujah. I
[44:18] give you all the praise." Now, why does
[44:21] he do this? So you can be a tree of
[44:24] righteousness. In other words, he can
[44:26] make you like you're a tree planted in
[44:29] the house of God. And David speaks of
[44:31] that in the Psalms.
[44:33] Uh Paul calls it in the New Testament.
[44:35] He said, "I'm I'm going to make you a
[44:37] pillar in the house of my God."
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Right? We don't have pillars at this
[44:41] building, but at my house, I got two
[44:43] little pillars outside of the house,
[44:45] right? You all seen where and they just
[44:47] kind of hold up the front the awning
[44:48] there of of the front porch. And God
[44:51] said, "If you will let me set you free,
[44:54] if you'll let me restore your joy, I'm
[44:56] going to make you a pillar to hold up
[44:58] the rest of the house."
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; And that's what we all want to be. We we
[45:05] should all want to be pillars that can
[45:07] hold up this the church here in Akran,
[45:09] Ohio.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; And also the the the church of Jesus
[45:13] Christ around the world.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Jesse, that church is
[45:17] struggling that I understand, but our
[45:19] church doesn't have to. We can have
[45:21] pillars that are holding up the house of
[45:23] God.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't I don't have to
[45:26] accept uh depression. I don't I don't
[45:29] have to accept mourning. I don't have
[45:32] have to accept being a slave to sin. I
[45:34] can be free.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; I don't have to accept a broken heart.
[45:38] I'll let Jesus heal my broken heart.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Did I tell you this one time? Uh
[45:45] I was speaking with somebody and and
[45:47] they they had lo I think it was a wife
[45:48] that lost her husband. Yeah. Yeah,
[45:50] that's right. It was a Catholic woman
[45:52] and and she said, "Brother or she she
[45:54] didn't call me brother Jesse." She calls
[45:55] me Jesse. She said, "Jesse, that hole in
[45:57] my heart where I've lost my husband,
[46:00] that hole never gets small any smaller.
[46:03] But she said, "The love that's around
[46:05] that hole gets bigger and bigger and
[46:07] bigger."
[46:09] I thought, "Wow, what a statement from a
[46:10] Catholic woman."
[46:13] In other words, there's always going to
[46:14] be pain, right? There there's always
[46:16] going to be uh some some scar, but God
[46:19] will give you love that overwhelms that
[46:22] pain.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; How many believe that by God's grace? In
[46:26] other words, you have so much more love
[46:30] that that pain won't feel so big
[46:32] anymore.
[46:40] And lastly, charity never fails.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; The Bible plainly says this that Jesus
[46:47] when he washed their feet, the Bible
[46:49] said he knew it was time to depart out
[46:51] of this world.
[46:53] and having loved his his own which were
[46:55] in the world, he loved them until the
[46:58] end. Church, what did he do? He he
[47:00] washed their feet.
[47:03] So remember that when we have the Lord's
[47:04] supper, I think it's in January,
[47:07] that is that is you getting a chance to
[47:10] show love. In other words, if I get to
[47:12] wash Mercy's feet next time or Jose's,
[47:16] that's me showing I'm going to love you
[47:18] to the end, Brother Jose.
[47:21] Right. Put the water on there. Brother
[47:22] Mercy's feet. Try to scrub it between
[47:25] those toes. Get it real clean. That's my
[47:28] way showing I'll never fail you. As far
[47:32] as what I mean is by God's grace, I'll
[47:34] never fail you. I mean, I'm going to
[47:36] make mistakes, but I'm going to love you
[47:38] to the end.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:42] So, that that's that's another scripture
[47:43] where charity doesn't fail. Charity
[47:46] doesn't run out. You're going to love
[47:48] somebody all the way to the end.
[47:53] And I like just I just put a few extra
[47:55] thoughts in there. His His love never
[47:57] failed. When Mary and Martha thought he
[47:59] failed at all, if you were here three
[48:01] days ago,
[48:03] he never fails. Even if he's late, he's
[48:05] right on time. Hallelujah. He never
[48:09] failed Paul. Paul asked three times,
[48:10] "God, heal me of my eye condition." And
[48:13] Jesus said, "No, my grace is sufficient
[48:16] for you in weakness. This is to keep you
[48:18] humble.
[48:21] I'm denying your request.
[48:24] But can you imagine Paul? He'd say,
[48:25] "God, I'm a scholar. I I I'm writing the
[48:28] Bible. I've written the Bible. I need my
[48:30] eyes to see." And Jesus says, "No, you
[48:32] need my grace. That's what you need."
[48:35] Well, that must mean if he's not going
[48:36] to heal me, that must mean that part of
[48:38] my life is over. That's probably what it
[48:40] meant. God doesn't heal you, then God's
[48:43] not going to use you in that realm
[48:44] anymore. God's going to use you in a
[48:46] different realm.
[48:49] Jesus denied his request even though he
[48:51] prayed it three times because he said
[48:54] you need to grow in your humility. Now
[48:57] don't raise your hand but I'm pretty
[48:58] sure all of us need to grow in humility.
[49:00] Praise God.
[49:03] And you need to understand that having
[49:06] perfect strength is trusting God in your
[49:09] weakness.
[49:12] Hallelujah.
[49:15] So, because Paul says, "When I'm weak,
[49:17] that's actually when I'm strong."
[49:20] &gt;&gt; In other words, when times are tough,
[49:21] that's when I pray more.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; When I'm sick, that's when I really
[49:24] focus on God more.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's what Paul
[49:29] experienced.
[49:31] Okay. Now, so I think that's I covered
[49:33] the life of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[49:34] right? Can everybody see Jesus had all
[49:36] 16 love attributes?
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Try to cover that.
[49:45] Now, let's get into this section. Now,
[49:47] I'm going to bring some different
[49:48] thoughts in here, and I trust it to be a
[49:50] blessing. I got about 15 minutes on my
[49:52] hour if I'd preach an hour.
[49:56] Now, here's the next thought. Uh after
[49:58] Paul says, "Charity never fails."
[50:01] So, after that thought, he breaks into
[50:03] this.
[50:05] Now, whether there be prophecies, they
[50:08] shall fail. Now, that doesn't mean a
[50:10] prophecy is going to fail. Like if
[50:11] you're a true prophet of God, if you say
[50:13] anything in the name of the Lord, it's
[50:14] going to come to pass. The only
[50:16] exception was Isaiah where God told
[50:19] Isaiah, "Go tell him, thus sayith the
[50:21] Lord, set his house in order." Right?
[50:23] Then he says, "Now go tell him, I'll
[50:24] give him 15 more years." That's the only
[50:26] time, right? But that that's God that's
[50:29] God's fornowledge. God had fornowledge
[50:31] of the perfect will of God and the
[50:33] permissive will of God.
[50:36] But it didn't fail. God just gave him
[50:37] the permissive will of God.
[50:40] Uh so whether there be prophecies, they
[50:43] shall fail. Now remember this is a
[50:45] church where they had so many tongues
[50:46] and interpretations, so many
[50:48] revelations, so many songs,
[50:52] &gt;&gt; right? This was a rich church, you know,
[50:54] financially
[50:56] and they had all these gifts operating.
[50:59] Paul sets it in order in the next
[51:01] chapter, but they had so many gifts.
[51:04] Everybody had some revelation, some
[51:05] inspiration.
[51:07] Now, we could use a little more of that.
[51:09] And the church said, like, in other
[51:11] words, I wish I wish I said it more. I
[51:14] wish you said it more. Oh, God gave me a
[51:15] revelation. Or God gave me a new song.
[51:18] Would that be nice?
[51:20] Austin seems to get some new ones
[51:21] lately.
[51:24] Hallelujah. Or God showed me a great
[51:26] revelation, the word this morning. I was
[51:28] in prayer.
[51:33] But either way, you know, he's talking,
[51:35] he's telling this group who has all
[51:37] these supernatural experiences, love is
[51:40] the only thing that won't fail.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; And whether they be tongues, they shall
[51:45] cease. Whether they whether it be
[51:47] knowledge, it shall vanish away. Now,
[51:49] this word fail, it means in inactivate.
[51:53] So, there will come a time when God will
[51:55] inactivate tongues and interpretation
[51:57] and prophecy. It's no longer active. We
[52:00] don't need it anymore.
[52:02] Okay. Now, not while the bride's here. I
[52:05] hope everybody caught that here. While
[52:07] the bride's here, all nine gifts will be
[52:09] operating.
[52:12] And Paul will tell us later when these
[52:15] gifts will cease.
[52:19] Now, here's what Paul's saying. For we
[52:21] know, we have knowledge in part, right?
[52:24] We have human knowledge and then we have
[52:26] divine knowledge. And we prophesy in
[52:29] part.
[52:31] So there's a human element to prophecies
[52:33] and all nine gifts of the Holy Ghost.
[52:36] You want a good example? Go listen to uh
[52:39] go listen to questions answer 64. They
[52:42] asked brother Bram. They said, "Brother
[52:43] Bam, didn't you say not to eat eggs at
[52:45] the end time?" You remember that,
[52:46] brother Jose? What does what does
[52:48] brother Bam say? Brother Ram says,
[52:50] "Well," he says, "I don't quite
[52:52] remember."
[52:54] He said, "Oh, yeah. The prophecy was uh
[52:56] don't live in a valley."
[52:59] uh because of the the runoff and brother
[53:01] Ram said it's because of the runoff of
[53:02] all the pesticides and everything like
[53:04] that. He said don't eat eggs and don't
[53:06] live in a valley. And they asked Brother
[53:08] Ram, "Did that come to pass?" And
[53:09] brother Ram doesn't really tell for
[53:11] sure. He says, "I think it's already
[53:12] come to pass." He says,
[53:15] "So church, what does that show?" He
[53:17] prophesied in part. In other words, he
[53:20] partly understood it, but listen, God is
[53:22] the one who will interpret that.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; It's just like Elijah. How many remember
[53:27] when God told Elijah, "You're going to
[53:29] anoint three people." There it is. How
[53:32] many did he anoint, church? What?
[53:35] Elisha. And all he did was just throw
[53:38] the mantle down, right? Elisha anointed
[53:41] the other one. And then a son of a
[53:43] prophet anointed the last one. But God
[53:46] told him, "Thus sayith the Lord, Elijah,
[53:48] you'll anoint three people." So, we got
[53:51] to we got to understand God interprets
[53:52] his word however he wants to. And so the
[53:55] prophecy about the eggs and living in
[53:57] valleys, this is a good example of that,
[53:59] brother Ram. He just prophesied what God
[54:02] said.
[54:03] And now I believe it was a local
[54:05] prophecy to the people right there in
[54:06] Jeffersonville. But it doesn't matter
[54:08] what I believe. It's what God believes.
[54:10] Right? God's going to bring it to pass.
[54:13] Or maybe he already brought it to pass.
[54:18] And church, this is also important to
[54:20] say that we do not emphasize gifts as
[54:24] much as the authority of the word of
[54:26] God.
[54:29] And this was the answer to one of Rod's
[54:31] questions. I don't know if he asked in
[54:32] front of everybody or not, but he said,
[54:34] "Brother Jesse, if he said, I I love I
[54:36] love what you say." He said, "But are Oh
[54:39] yeah, I went through all those 40
[54:40] prophecies of Brother Brandham." He
[54:42] said, "Are those equal to the Bible or
[54:45] not?" That's a really good question.
[54:48] So my answer was all the ones that are
[54:51] in the Bible or just explain the Bible,
[54:53] they are just revelations of the Bible.
[54:56] But what about the ones about the eggs
[54:58] and the in the valley?
[55:01] That's a pretty good question, isn't it?
[55:04] But I know what the Bible says. The
[55:05] Bible said, "Don't add one word. Don't
[55:07] take one word away."
[55:11] So this is my answer to that.
[55:14] Anything that's not in the Bible, it
[55:16] can't be made equal to the Bible because
[55:17] we can't add anything to it.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; So, it's an impart manifestation. It's
[55:23] not as authoritative as the word of God.
[55:27] Hallelujah.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Because this, we know in part, we
[55:31] prophesy in part.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[55:37] Because church, you and I do not want to
[55:39] be guilty of adding anything to the word
[55:40] of God or taking anything away. It's
[55:43] quite a balance, is it not?
[55:46] &gt;&gt; It's a That was a excellent question.
[55:47] That's probably one of the most in-depth
[55:49] questions I've heard in a long time.
[55:53] Now, here's how Brother Brandham
[55:54] explains it. Remember, I read this a few
[55:56] weeks ago. He said, "The gifts are just
[55:58] not to be trusted too much."
[56:02] In other words, you you can't when gifts
[56:04] operate, you can't fully make them on
[56:06] the same level as the Bible.
[56:10] That's what brother Brandham calls them
[56:12] little sensations,
[56:15] tongues, interpretation, prophecy,
[56:17] dreams, right? Visions,
[56:20] words of faith, speaking to the
[56:23] mountain, all these things. There are
[56:25] little sensations that we have.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Thank God for sensations, though.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you're getting
[56:31] sensations from God and not from the
[56:32] devil?
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:35] Glory to God.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; But see, Paul says, All these things
[56:39] will fail. See, every one of them. Oh,
[56:41] yeah. This is what people say. I got a
[56:43] revelation come to me. I have a song. I
[56:45] have a new song. I have a prophecy.
[56:49] In other words, don't anchor your soul
[56:52] on something that's not in the word of
[56:54] God.
[56:56] You never you never place as much
[56:58] emphasis on something outside the word
[57:00] of God as you would the word of God
[57:02] itself.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:07] Because brother Ram says, "Where's your
[57:09] anchor?" Your anchor is in Christ Jesus.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; So we don't trust upon sensations. We
[57:16] don't trust upon revelations. We don't
[57:18] trust these things. Only we trust
[57:21] Christ. It's by faith that we move out
[57:23] there. Okay? So I don't understand that
[57:26] last line, but
[57:28] our anchor has to be in the love of
[57:30] Jesus Christ. Right. Our anchor has to
[57:32] be in the word of Jesus Christ.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:38] Now, here's
[57:41] uh well, we're almost there. But when
[57:44] that which is perfect is come, then that
[57:46] which is in part shall be done away. So
[57:48] now, now we know when our gifts no
[57:52] longer needed. It's when the perfection
[57:54] has come.
[57:57] Paul says, "When I was a child, I spake
[57:59] like a child. I understood as a child. I
[58:02] thought as a child, but when I became a
[58:04] man, I put away childish things, right?
[58:08] Like when I was a child, I thought, I'm
[58:09] gonna grow up and be a millionaire. I'm
[58:10] gonna be in the NFL. Well, I put that
[58:13] away when I become a man, right? I put
[58:15] away that foolish dream.
[58:18] So, when will the perfection come? Paul
[58:21] tells us next. And church, here's the
[58:24] point I want to say. It kind of goes
[58:25] along with that last quote. We don't
[58:26] trust we don't trust the gifts too much.
[58:28] But
[58:29] spiritual gifts here are elementary
[58:32] compared to the reality of the heavenly
[58:35] paradise.
[58:38] So anything you get in a dream or vision
[58:40] or tongue or interpretation or speaking
[58:42] to the mountain, a word of faith,
[58:44] anything you get through that is
[58:46] elementary. It's minor. It's childish
[58:48] compared to what's in heaven. Because
[58:50] whatever's in heaven, you know that's
[58:53] rock solid. That's that's where you got
[58:56] a new body, a new understanding.
[58:57] Nothing's going to pass away in heaven,
[59:00] &gt;&gt; right? But things we need down here,
[59:01] that might pass away. We won't need that
[59:03] anymore.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Now, Paul tells us when the perfect will
[59:09] come. The perfect comes is when we see
[59:12] Jesus face to face. So, I like that
[59:13] song. He's saying, "What a day that will
[59:14] be when by Jesus I shall see." He That's
[59:17] really good. That's really timely
[59:18] because you didn't know what I was going
[59:19] to preach, buddy. That to me, that's a
[59:21] witness. Amen. I look for God's witness
[59:23] in things.
[59:27] For now, we see through a glass darkly.
[59:31] So, we're just And that's of course the
[59:32] word for a mirror. In those days, the
[59:34] mirrors were not nice like we have
[59:36] today. You could just barely see a
[59:38] little bit of your reflection in the
[59:39] mirror.
[59:41] But then when perfection comes, we will
[59:44] see Jesus face to face.
[59:47] Right now, I know in part that's all of
[59:51] us. But then shall I know even also as I
[59:55] am known. So Jesus knew you before the
[59:58] foundation of the world. He numbered
[1:00:00] your days. He knew the hair of your
[1:00:02] head.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; He knew all those things. And when you
[1:00:07] see Jesus face to face, then you'll know
[1:00:09] more. You'll know perfectly like he
[1:00:12] knows you.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:17] So now we know. And people today, you
[1:00:20] know, it's not really in message
[1:00:22] circles, but some they'll say, "Uh, oh,
[1:00:24] we don't need gifts because the perfect
[1:00:25] word has come."
[1:00:28] You're deceived, my friend, is what I
[1:00:29] would say.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Because we don't see Jesus face to face.
[1:00:32] And they'll say, "No, no, we do. We We
[1:00:34] have the picture of the white cloud.
[1:00:35] That's Jesus' face.
[1:00:38] You deceived person. You s your poor
[1:00:40] deceived soul."
[1:00:46] Now this is important in one way because
[1:00:49] you might come across it.
[1:00:51] You might come across this quote and
[1:00:53] maybe Jose has talked to people about
[1:00:55] this. Brother Brandham actually agreed
[1:00:57] with this
[1:00:59] to say that we have the perfect word.
[1:01:02] But now notice he doesn't say thus
[1:01:04] sayith the Lord.
[1:01:06] So, some people, I'm going to read this
[1:01:08] in a moment, but before I do, some
[1:01:10] people use this quote to say, "We don't
[1:01:12] need gifts anymore because we've already
[1:01:14] got perfection that's come to us."
[1:01:17] And they'll say, "We don't need
[1:01:18] preachers anymore
[1:01:20] because we've already got the perfect
[1:01:22] word." Now, look, Brother Ram agrees
[1:01:24] with this, but he doesn't he doesn't
[1:01:27] apply it the way false teachers are
[1:01:29] applying it today.
[1:01:31] That's why going through every chapter
[1:01:32] of a book is very important because you
[1:01:34] have quotes from brother Brandham on all
[1:01:35] these verses.
[1:01:40] Paul says when that which is perfect has
[1:01:41] come that which is in part shall be done
[1:01:43] away with. So all these little things of
[1:01:45] jumping up and down like a kid trying to
[1:01:47] talk in tonesues trying not actually
[1:01:50] speaking in tonesues and all these other
[1:01:52] things when that which is perfect and we
[1:01:54] do have today by God's help the perfect
[1:01:56] interpretation of the word with divine
[1:01:58] vindication
[1:02:02] then that which is in part is done away
[1:02:03] with when I was a child I spake as a
[1:02:05] child I understood as a child but when I
[1:02:07] became a man I put away childish things
[1:02:09] amen I go to preaching and then don't
[1:02:11] get to these things now that's all he
[1:02:12] said about 1 Corinthians Ians 13. He did
[1:02:15] not elaborate on that.
[1:02:20] Now, if you say, "Brother Jesse, do do
[1:02:22] you agree with that?" Well, to an
[1:02:24] extent, I do.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; I agree. We have the perfect
[1:02:27] interpretation of the mysteries of God
[1:02:31] because that's what the Bible said. What
[1:02:33] did what did the seventh what did the
[1:02:34] seventh angel finish, church? He
[1:02:36] finished the what? Mysteries of God.
[1:02:39] So, I believe that is perfectly revealed
[1:02:42] to us.
[1:02:43] Right? Which includes the Godhead, the
[1:02:45] rapture, hallelujah, the baptism of the
[1:02:48] Holy Ghost, the mother harlot, the Roman
[1:02:50] Catholic Church.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; I believe in those areas of the
[1:02:53] mysteries, we have the perfect
[1:02:55] revelation of God's word.
[1:03:01] But I do not believe a man should take
[1:03:03] this quote and say, "Oh, we don't need
[1:03:05] gifts anymore. You don't have to pray
[1:03:06] for gifts anymore.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; We already see Jesus face to face. If I
[1:03:11] did, I'd sure be a lot different than I
[1:03:12] am right now. Praise God. If I saw him
[1:03:15] face to face, I don't I would not be
[1:03:16] sick right now. Praise God. Because he'd
[1:03:19] heal me if I saw him face to face.
[1:03:25] Now, here's a quote to balance this out.
[1:03:27] Don't forget these quotes. God has
[1:03:29] reminded me of these quotes recently,
[1:03:30] and I made videos about them. What says,
[1:03:33] "There may be times I may not be able to
[1:03:35] set it together, but all these other
[1:03:37] people are saying, "Oh, it's perfect,
[1:03:38] brother. Every word is perfect.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; But what about this quote?
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; I don't believe there's any mortal in
[1:03:45] the world can correctly set every word
[1:03:48] together. Oh no, it's perfect. Brother
[1:03:50] Jesse, we'll show him this quote.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; How many believe brother was mortal? He
[1:03:54] died. Was he mortal?
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; But we can only do it as the Holy Ghost
[1:04:01] inspires us to. Many times it's contrary
[1:04:04] to our teaching.
[1:04:06] So, we got to be careful not to be
[1:04:09] pulled by one or two quotes. There's
[1:04:12] always other quotes that we have to
[1:04:14] balance out by God's grace.
[1:04:20] They asked, "Brother Bram,
[1:04:23] uh, do a Moses and Elijah have to die?
[1:04:25] What about Enoch?" I don't know. I don't
[1:04:28] know. I'm just going to tell you I don't
[1:04:30] know. I don't know all the answers,
[1:04:32] folks. I don't know. And if I don't
[1:04:34] know, I'm going to tell you I don't
[1:04:35] know. If I do know, I won't tell you
[1:04:38] till I do know about it. I don't know.
[1:04:41] I've often wondered that myself.
[1:04:43] Eight times he says, "I don't know. I
[1:04:46] don't know. I don't know." Yet people
[1:04:47] say, "Oh, he's got he brought the
[1:04:49] perfect word of God with vindication. We
[1:04:52] got every answer in the Bible." No,
[1:04:54] you've misunderstood what he was saying.
[1:04:57] Isn't it ridiculous how people Look what
[1:04:59] evil spirits do to people. It's so sad
[1:05:01] what evil spirits do to people.
[1:05:06] And the and these are quotes. Brothers
[1:05:07] have brought the this one to me.
[1:05:09] Brothers brought this one to me and say,
[1:05:11] "We don't need the gifts anymore.
[1:05:12] Brothers have told me that to my face.
[1:05:14] We're in the bride age." All these
[1:05:15] things. Said, "No, you misunderstood
[1:05:16] that."
[1:05:19] And they're just really they're just
[1:05:20] really zealous about their own uh
[1:05:22] man-made revival, their own man-made
[1:05:24] creed interpretation. But church, we got
[1:05:25] to have a backbone. Hallelujah. We got
[1:05:28] to know where we stand.
[1:05:30] Thank God we know where we stand. How
[1:05:32] about this one? Brother said, "I'm not a
[1:05:34] preacher. They're preachers. They've got
[1:05:35] a higher office than I have."
[1:05:39] What
[1:05:41] preachers have a higher office than
[1:05:42] Brother Brandham.
[1:05:44] And what does he quote? He quotes the
[1:05:46] scripture.
[1:05:48] Ephesians 4:11.
[1:05:55] Look at this one. Brother said, "I'd be
[1:05:57] daring to stand before these men with
[1:06:00] the word of God, the ministers." In
[1:06:02] other words, I would not dare stand
[1:06:04] before a minister in in uh San Jose,
[1:06:07] California.
[1:06:09] Yet, they'll tell me the opposite. How
[1:06:11] dare you, Brother Jesse, uh trying to
[1:06:14] correct one of Brother Bram's minor
[1:06:15] doctrines. How dare I not?
[1:06:19] We want to be right. Brother Ram didn't
[1:06:20] have all the answers,
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:06:25] Well, yeah. Brother Random says, "How
[1:06:26] dare I try to stand before these
[1:06:28] preachers?"
[1:06:32] Doesn't this prove how humble brother
[1:06:33] Random was?
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; And brother Ram realized, "I don't have
[1:06:36] all the answers."
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Now, did he give us the major
[1:06:39] revelations with us saying the Lord?
[1:06:41] Absolutely. But he was also humble to
[1:06:43] know, "I don't know everything."
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; And I love this. They preach. They know
[1:06:50] what they're talking about. All you
[1:06:52] preachers don't know what you're talking
[1:06:53] about. Brother Ram said we do.
[1:06:57] I just listen to what they say and say,
[1:07:00] "Amen." I love that.
[1:07:03] And I go on because they're men of God.
[1:07:05] I follow them. Now, here here's what if
[1:07:08] an honest person who loved the tapes
[1:07:12] heard this, here's here's my idea of
[1:07:13] what they would look like.
[1:07:17] Huh? What? What? Brother Random just
[1:07:20] says amen to the preachers, sits down,
[1:07:23] does not dare stand before them, and
[1:07:25] follows preachers. I thought we're
[1:07:27] supposed to follow the seven church age
[1:07:29] messenger. Now, that made me laugh
[1:07:31] because I like that. That's a chat GTP
[1:07:33] generated image.
[1:07:36] Isn't that true?
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Everything these tape worshippers are
[1:07:40] saying is opposite of what brother
[1:07:43] Brandham just said.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; They're saying, "You sit down, preacher.
[1:07:47] You say amen. You follow Brother Ram.
[1:07:49] Brother Ram's saying exactly the
[1:07:50] opposite.
[1:07:55] Uh, I just got over my hour, so let me
[1:07:57] see. I might stop there because this
[1:07:59] gets into a deeper thought here.
[1:08:06] Yeah, let me close with um
[1:08:10] I'm already at I'm already over an hour.
[1:08:11] I feel like I'm just getting warmed up,
[1:08:12] but my throat don't feel like I have a
[1:08:14] whole lot here. Yeah, let me close with
[1:08:15] this. Um, last last few thoughts here,
[1:08:18] maybe five 10 minutes. Let me
[1:08:22] in this last chapter. I'm sorry. In this
[1:08:24] last verse here of 1 Corinthians 13, I
[1:08:27] just want to remind you uh of just a few
[1:08:30] things that you you'll find important.
[1:08:31] Brother Cam and I were talking and he
[1:08:32] really enjoyed this.
[1:08:35] Verse 13. And now abideth faith, hope,
[1:08:37] and charity. These three, but the
[1:08:39] greatest of these is charity.
[1:08:42] So there's three great attributes of
[1:08:44] God. faith, hope and charity. Charity
[1:08:49] though is greater than all of them.
[1:08:51] Right? And brother Ram said Jesus
[1:08:55] represented these three attributes
[1:08:56] through three different men. Peter
[1:08:59] represented faith. James represented
[1:09:01] hope. And John represented love.
[1:09:05] Okay.
[1:09:08] Brother Ram said this. Look here. Jesus
[1:09:10] taken Peter, James, and John. Faith,
[1:09:13] hope, charity. Don't you see those
[1:09:15] gifted people? Them three, the hope,
[1:09:18] faith, and charity. Now, I preached this
[1:09:20] when God gave brother Austin that large
[1:09:22] sum of money a couple years ago. I was
[1:09:24] preaching this series
[1:09:27] uh on the love of God.
[1:09:30] Okay.
[1:09:31] So, Brother Ram said, "Every time you
[1:09:33] see Peter, James, and John, those were
[1:09:35] Jesus's middleman, we say, or not, maybe
[1:09:38] middleman is not the right word. um his
[1:09:40] chosen ones or his special small group
[1:09:42] of special preachers. We'd say
[1:09:47] hope was James. He was the only he was
[1:09:50] the one that set the church in order.
[1:09:51] Faith was Peter. Charity was John.
[1:09:53] Faith, hope, and charity. It was God's
[1:09:55] representatives on the earth. And the
[1:09:58] people laid in Peter's shadow were
[1:10:00] healed because he represented faith. Oh
[1:10:02] my friends, don't think I'm yelling at
[1:10:04] you friends. You think I'm excited, but
[1:10:06] I'm not. I'm trying to get my point to
[1:10:09] you close enough so you'll see what I'm
[1:10:10] talking about.
[1:10:13] Now, here's all the um here's some of
[1:10:17] the beautiful times where Peter, James,
[1:10:19] and John were together. They were there
[1:10:22] when Jesus when Jesus raised Jarius's
[1:10:24] daughter from the dead.
[1:10:26] So, what did you need to overcome death?
[1:10:28] Faith, hope, and love.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; So, why am I saying this? Because this
[1:10:33] will remind you if I want to see God
[1:10:35] move, I need faith, hope, and love in my
[1:10:37] life.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; And if I'm struggling with faith, say,
[1:10:40] God, bring my raise my faith. If I'm
[1:10:42] struggling with hope, God, give me hope
[1:10:44] for the future. If I'm struggling with
[1:10:46] love, God, help me to forgive people and
[1:10:48] love people.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; And then you'll see God move. Then
[1:10:51] you'll see Jesus move in your midst.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; At Mount Transfiguration, Peter, James,
[1:10:56] and John went up with Jesus. Right? So
[1:10:59] if how many want to see a revelation? If
[1:11:01] you want to see a revelation, you need
[1:11:02] faith, hope, and charity. These are the
[1:11:05] greatest.
[1:11:07] And then they couldn't even pray one
[1:11:08] hour in the Gethsemane, but he only
[1:11:10] called them to pray and they couldn't do
[1:11:12] it because of the weakness of the flesh.
[1:11:17] And then there's some other ones too
[1:11:19] there. Yeah, they're recognized as
[1:11:20] pillars in the church. Uh Paul
[1:11:22] recognized them as pillars in the
[1:11:24] church. Now, God always had a small
[1:11:26] group of believers, right? Moses, Aaron,
[1:11:28] Naab, and Abaiu. They witnessed the
[1:11:31] visible glory of God in Exodus 24. We
[1:11:34] just read it at home. Or wait, did we?
[1:11:36] Yeah. Yeah, we did because we're in
[1:11:38] chapter 31. Yeah. Yeah, we read that a
[1:11:41] couple weeks ago. And then God had Moses
[1:11:43] and Joshua together. David's three
[1:11:46] mighty men were in a special class above
[1:11:48] everybody else. In other words, Peter,
[1:11:50] James, and John had gifts that were
[1:11:53] greater than the other preachers.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So some preachers today,
[1:11:58] they'll have greater gifts than others,
[1:12:00] and God can use them in a greater way
[1:12:02] today. So we should just be thankful for
[1:12:04] what God has called us to be.
[1:12:06] Hallelujah.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Be happy for the preachers. And I'm I'm
[1:12:09] saying I'm the least of the preachers.
[1:12:10] I'm not putting myself in there. But
[1:12:12] some preachers are so gifted, God will
[1:12:14] use them in special ways. Doesn't mean
[1:12:16] they're perfect, but it just means they
[1:12:18] have a greater calling, greater gifts,
[1:12:20] and God will reward them for that. Thank
[1:12:21] God for that.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; But let's pray for them. Let's rejoice
[1:12:26] when one part of the body rejoices.
[1:12:28] Let's rejoice with that part of the
[1:12:29] body. Hallelujah. So for me, I got to be
[1:12:33] happy for the popular preachers, the
[1:12:35] preachers who have big ministries. I got
[1:12:36] to be h and I am. I'm happy for them.
[1:12:38] Praise God. But God, let me be faithful
[1:12:40] with what you've called me to do.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; And Jose asked me when I first preach on
[1:12:46] charity, what about that quote?
[1:12:49] And I'm going to close with this.
[1:12:52] Thus sayeth the Lord, it'll take perfect
[1:12:55] charity to put you in that place. He's
[1:12:58] speaking of paradise in heaven when he
[1:13:00] went beyond the curtain of time. For
[1:13:03] that's all there was there.
[1:13:07] No matter what money, how much religious
[1:13:10] demonstrations, how many good deeds you
[1:13:12] done or whatever you've done, that won't
[1:13:14] count nothing on that day. It'll take
[1:13:17] perfect charity.
[1:13:20] So whatever you do, you lay aside
[1:13:24] everything else. Lay aside any divisions
[1:13:26] you have against anybody
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; because God's trying to unite us
[1:13:32] until you're just so filled with the
[1:13:34] love of God till you can love those who
[1:13:38] hate you. Let's stand to our feet and
[1:13:40] don't switch over. I just want to show
[1:13:41] those 16 attributes again. I'm going to
[1:13:43] go fast. Musicians can come.
[1:13:46] It's thus sayeth the Lord. If we don't
[1:13:49] have these, that's here's what I want to
[1:13:50] get to. We're not going to make it to
[1:13:52] that place because that's all that was
[1:13:54] there was the love of God.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:00] Did you enjoy the word today, saints?
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; I love the word of God. It just all
[1:14:05] flows together. Praise the Lord.
[1:14:12] Let's look at this list here before we
[1:14:13] pray.
[1:14:17] Thus sayith the Lord, you have to have
[1:14:19] this or you won't make it there.
[1:14:29] You must suffer long.
[1:14:32] You must be kind.
[1:14:35] You must not envy people.
[1:14:38] You must not exalt yourself. Must not be
[1:14:41] puffed up. You must behave yourself
[1:14:44] seemly. Amen. You must seek others needs
[1:14:48] rather than your own.
[1:14:50] You must not easily be provoked.
[1:14:54] You must think no evil.
[1:14:56] You must not rejoice in You must hate
[1:14:58] iniquity. I'll say it like that. You
[1:15:00] must rejoice in the truth. You must be
[1:15:03] able to bear all things. You and I must
[1:15:05] believe all the word of God. You and I
[1:15:08] must hope for all the promises of God.
[1:15:12] We must endure all the trials that God
[1:15:14] has for us and we must not fail. Praise
[1:15:18] God. We must go and love all the way to
[1:15:22] the end. Praise God. How many want a
[1:15:24] testimony like that? Let's bow our heads
[1:15:27] as we pray.
[1:15:32] That's quite a list, church, by God's
[1:15:33] grace. Quite a list. With man, that's
[1:15:38] impossible. But with God all things are
[1:15:41] possible. Praise God. Remember church,
[1:15:44] the Bible said the love of God was shed
[1:15:51] in their hearts.
[1:15:56] Let me look up that verse. I believe
[1:15:58] it's Acts 2.
[1:16:00] No, it's Romans 5:5. I always get that
[1:16:02] mixed up.
[1:16:03] The love of God is shed abroad in our
[1:16:05] hearts by the Holy Ghost.
[1:16:10] As we finish today, let's pray and ask
[1:16:13] God, Lord, pour out your love in my
[1:16:15] heart because I want to be there on that
[1:16:18] day.
[1:16:20] I want to run up to brother Brandham and
[1:16:21] say, "My precious brother."
[1:16:26] You left your your wife and your
[1:16:27] children to preach in Ohio. And then I
[1:16:31] heard later, the next generation, I
[1:16:32] heard your message because you left
[1:16:34] Jeffersonville, went to Ohio.
[1:16:37] They started a church in Latin. I got to
[1:16:39] go.
[1:16:41] Thank you, my precious brother.
[1:16:46] We don't want the devil to divide us
[1:16:50] and bring in some root of bitterness.
[1:16:52] That's why roots of bitterness are so
[1:16:54] dangerous
[1:16:56] because bitterness is the opposite of
[1:16:58] love.
[1:17:00] Love can forgive people.
[1:17:03] Love can bear with your brothers and
[1:17:05] sisters
[1:17:06] in the church.
[1:17:09] Love can endure all things. Love will
[1:17:14] never fail.
[1:17:20] Father God, as we bow our faces to the
[1:17:23] dust where we came from, Lord God,
[1:17:29] we're reminded today of the amazing love
[1:17:31] of God. How rich and pure, how
[1:17:33] measurless and strong. It shall forever
[1:17:36] endure the saints and angel songs.
[1:17:43] Lord, more than anything, I want to go
[1:17:44] to that land beyond the curtain of time
[1:17:46] where Jesus is, where you are.
[1:17:51] Lord, I'm today. I'm laying aside
[1:17:52] anything, Lord God, that would hinder me
[1:17:54] from getting there.
[1:17:56] Lord, just show me if there's something
[1:17:58] I need to lay aside. Lord, I've tried to
[1:18:00] lay aside all these things.
[1:18:04] I'm trying to be united, Lord, with your
[1:18:06] people
[1:18:07] to have the same spirit, the same love
[1:18:09] one for another.
[1:18:17] Lord, one day
[1:18:19] we'll see you face to face and then we
[1:18:22] will know as you know us.
[1:18:26] But Lord, until that day, Lord, we we
[1:18:28] understand in part. We use gifts in
[1:18:31] part.
[1:18:35] We're grateful, Lord. We see through a
[1:18:37] glass darkly. At least we can see, Lord.
[1:18:44] So, we want to also express our
[1:18:45] gratitude to you and our thanksgiving
[1:18:47] for the gifts of God.
[1:18:50] But Lord, we ask today, Lord God, that
[1:18:52] you'll help us to lay aside any sin that
[1:18:55] easily besets us, especially bitterness
[1:18:57] that would take away the love of God out
[1:18:59] of our hearts.
[1:19:03] Lord, when it seems like you're late,
[1:19:05] you're right on time. Hallelujah.
[1:19:11] Lord, you love to the end. Help us to
[1:19:13] love people all the way to the end,
[1:19:17] forgiving our enemies. As brother Ram
[1:19:20] said, loving those who hate us.
[1:19:24] If there's anyone here who doesn't have
[1:19:26] that type of love, I pray you'd shed it
[1:19:29] in their hearts by the Holy Ghost today.
[1:19:31] Lord God, grant it, Lord God.
[1:19:34] Hallelujah.
[1:19:36] Just pour it out on their heart, Lord
[1:19:38] God.
[1:19:42] In my life, I want to see these 16
[1:19:44] attributes, Lord God.
[1:19:51] Your people here want to hear
[1:19:55] you say, "Well done, my good and
[1:19:57] faithful servant." We all want to hear
[1:19:58] that. It'll take the love of God to do
[1:20:01] it. Give us love. When our enemies think
[1:20:05] of us, may they know that it's love.
[1:20:08] When our family that doesn't believe the
[1:20:09] message thinks of us, may they know that
[1:20:12] they love the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:20:15] Hallelujah.
[1:20:18] May the world know that you came because
[1:20:20] of the love that we have at this church,
[1:20:22] Lord God.
[1:20:28] So we bless your holy name today, God.
[1:20:29] Receive our worship. Make our hearts
[1:20:31] tender, Lord. Fill with the love of God
[1:20:35] in Jesus Christ's name.
