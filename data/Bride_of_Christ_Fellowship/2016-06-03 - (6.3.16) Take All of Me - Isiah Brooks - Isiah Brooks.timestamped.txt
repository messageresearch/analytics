[17:15] Lord this is Romans 8 ver
[17:23] 28 and we know that all things work
[17:27] together for good to them that love God
[17:32] to them who are the called according to
[17:35] his purpose for whom he did for know he
[17:40] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[17:44] the image of his son that he might be
[17:48] the firstborn among many bre moreover
[17:53] whom he did
[17:55] predestinate them he also called
[17:59] and whom he called he also
[18:03] jifi and whom he justified he also
[18:08] glorified what shall we then say to
[18:12] these things if God us who can be
[18:17] against us he that Spar not his own son
[18:22] but delivered him up for us
[18:25] all how shall he not with him also
[18:29] freely give us all
[18:31] things who
[18:34] shall anything to the charge of God's
[18:37] elect it is God that
[18:40] justifieth who is he
[18:43] thatth it is Christ that died rather
[18:48] that is risen again who is even at the
[18:51] right hand of God who also maketh
[18:55] intercession for
[18:57] us who shall separate us from the love
[19:01] of Christ shall tribulation or distress
[19:06] or persecution or famine or nakedness or
[19:11] Peril or
[19:13] sword as it is written for thy sake we
[19:17] are killed all the day long we are

[19:36] death nor life nor angels nor
[19:41] principalities nor powers nor these
[19:44] present nor things to come nor height
[19:47] nor depth nor any other creature shall

[43:57] Jus
[44:05] Christ we are looking at a lot of things
[44:08] and so many things are flooding my
[44:13] mind we realize we're living in the last
[44:16] day and I got to be careful that I
[44:19] justes don't cross tomorrow message up
[44:21] with

[44:27] that I believe there is a revival going
[44:30] on yes sir a brother just the other day
[44:33] told me that uh I don't need or we
[44:36] shouldn't pray for Revival but we should
[44:39] pray for the last ones to come in but I
[44:42] believe that if I pray for Revival the
[44:45] last ones will come amen Lord you can't
[44:49] tell me by God's grace that we are where
[44:52] we should be that's right Amen brother
[44:55] brandom spoke a message and he called it
[44:59] the identifications of a true
[45:02] church that's right there's no way to
[45:04] get around
[45:06] it if you don't see it there
[45:09] amen where is
[45:12] it and I believe that God gave us an
[45:14] answer last night when he said that
[45:16] we've been trying to live by law right
[45:19] law have oppressed yeah the gifts of God
[45:23] that's within
[45:24] us
[45:26] amen cuz remember when God impact you
[45:29] with the Holy Ghost it is not just but
[45:33] it is the life of God Amen and
[45:36] everything that God is amen you
[45:40] are yes so you can't tell me that there
[45:43] is not a gift or gifts in you right if
[45:47] you have the Holy
[45:48] Ghost because God is full of
[45:52] gifts y'all hear what I'm saying but the
[45:55] question comes to mind who are they who
[45:59] are those ones that will make
[46:02] heaven in Psalms
[46:05] 24 the word of God says beginning at the
[46:08] first verse the Earth is the
[46:11] Lords and the fullness thereof the world
[46:16] and they that dwell therein amen for he
[46:19] has founded it upon the Seas and
[46:21] established it upon the flood here's the
[46:25] question who shall Ascend into the hill
[46:29] of the Lord or who shall stand in his
[46:34] holy
[46:35] place now you Mount Zion now in order to
[46:39] get there you got to us
[46:41] sin and then Jesus said the only people
[46:43] who can Ascend are those who descend
[46:46] amen that's true Amen in other words you
[46:48] have to come from God Amen in order to
[46:51] go back to
[46:53] God he that have clean
[46:56] hands and a pure heart who have not
[47:00] lifted up his soul to vanity nor sworn
[47:04] deceitfully he shall receive the Bess
[47:06] blessings from the Lord and
[47:08] righteousness from the god of his
[47:10] salvation listen this is the generation
[47:13] of them that seek him that seek thy face
[47:17] oh Jo Jacob now listen he said now these
[47:20] are the
[47:22] ones ain't that amazing yeah
[47:26] that will Ascend those who seek his
[47:29] face and this day the face of God has
[47:33] been
[47:34] seen no other generation outside of this
[47:38] age why do you think amen people are
[47:41] attacking the cloud yeah because the
[47:44] cloud amen reveals the face of
[47:48] God
[47:50] sir and here in the message when it
[47:53] comes to the rap brother amen TI in this
[47:56] portion of the scripture lift up your
[47:59] heads yes sir oh ye gates and be lifted
[48:02] up ye Everlasting doors and the king of
[48:05] glory shall come in and he talks about
[48:08] those who were under the law who found
[48:10] the grace of God and when God
[48:13] resurrected when Jesus resurrected they
[48:15] resurrected
[48:17] too
[48:18] Hallelujah and what they didn't realize
[48:21] is that when he resurrected I did too
[48:24] amen yes sir who is this king of glory
[48:28] the lord strong and mighty the Lord
[48:31] Mighty in
[48:33] battle Hallelujah yes sir lift up your
[48:37] heads oh you Gates even lift them up the
[48:39] Everlasting doors and the king of glory
[48:41] shall come in I love this brother
[48:45] because the king of glory was the only
[48:49] on that enter that Gat the host of the
[48:53] redeemed for that age right behind so
[48:57] the gates wasn't just open for Jesus but
[49:00] it was open for all who died in amen
[49:05] hallelujah who is this king of glory
[49:08] there it is the Lord of hosts see he
[49:12] couldn't just say the Lord because he
[49:15] had a host coming behind hear what I'm
[49:17] saying the Lord of host he is the king
[49:21] of
[49:22] glory and then David said
[49:28] that
[49:29] rest that to meditate on it think about
[49:35] it all of me I'm G say some things now
[49:40] inspired by what brother Cam said last
[49:43] night so if you get
[49:47] upset you know what I'm saying he's the
[49:51] blame we realize we're living in the
[49:53] last days it's so important that we
[49:57] understand yeah because I'm going tell
[49:59] you something people I said this the
[50:01] other day and I think it's in the
[50:03] message and I could be wrong but I know
[50:05] you'll be familiar with what I'm saying
[50:07] when brother Brandon when he had to
[50:10] there was a white stone and he cut the
[50:13] top of the stone and we find out that
[50:16] there was an Unwritten word there and he
[50:18] told those preachers that was with them
[50:20] stay right here and look upon the stone
[50:24] amen God will reveal to you the mystery
[50:28] of the stone but I need you to stay
[50:32] right here yeah brother bam said none of
[50:35] them did they all walked
[50:38] away Hallelujah by walking away they
[50:43] gave their own
[50:46] interpretation of the message and so
[50:49] what we have been dealing with Young
[50:53] Generation those who have come after the
[50:56] great leaders hello because remember now
[51:00] they did not understand it but you see
[51:03] we who have been
[51:06] ordained to understand
[51:08] it will see it amen see it is simple
[51:13] amen yes yes it is really simple because
[51:16] you must understand brother random
[51:18] called this message his holy ghost
[51:22] message now look at all of the
[51:24] Ministries almost all of them have
[51:28] shipwreck yeah and the Lord allowed
[51:31] people to be confused yeah y'all hear
[51:33] what I'm saying so much so people don't
[51:36] even know what the Holy Ghost is that's
[51:39] right this message that's right they
[51:42] don't know what it is or who he is
[51:44] that's right that's the trth yes sir yes
[51:47] Men Who Rose up and interpreted what the
[51:50] prophet said because you know that's
[51:52] what Dayan and corter did yeah

[51:58] leadership what happened to them they
[51:59] were swallowed up by the California
[52:01] earthquake
[52:03] [Laughter]
[52:06] amen coming from the message of
[52:09] Grace he said Paul said in 1 Corinthians
[52:13] 13 though I speak with tongues of men
[52:15] and angels though have have discernment
[52:18] though have gifts to feed I'll take all

[58:59] tree to move out of his
[59:02] way that tree is so planted if there
[59:06] come a thunderstorm yeah he can't move
[59:10] amen if there is a hilt he can't
[59:16] move it doesn't matter what God sends
[59:20] his way he's there to stay amen
[59:25] because of the change of the SE season
[59:29] that tree will
[59:31] grow hear what I'm saying even God knows
[59:35] how to Pro
[59:42] his what are you talking about I'm
[59:44] talking about
[59:47] surrendering I was telling the church at
[59:49] home you can't produce nothing amen I
[59:52] said but what we need to learn how to do
[59:54] is that right right the word of God said
[59:56] no man can add one Cub to a statue right
[59:59] but one thing we can do is he
[1:00:03] amen every tree is has the ability to
[1:00:10] yield
[1:00:12] Hallelujah today I believe that's why
[1:00:14] when Jesus there was no fig on it it
[1:00:18] wasn't that the Fig didn't tree didn't
[1:00:20] have the ability to produce it right
[1:00:22] somehow the tree didn't learn how to
[1:00:25] [Laughter]
[1:00:34] they fail
[1:00:37] toi is
[1:00:39] to yield something is to to the
[1:00:42] possession or power of
[1:00:45] another Hallelujah Lord that means you
[1:00:48] must take away all your
[1:00:52] control you don't control nothing yeah

[1:13:20] am but I like it this
[1:13:22] way it goes on down in here in the 31st

[1:13:28] near unto me and all the people came
[1:13:30] near to him and he repaired the altar of

[1:13:40] that was broken down come on somebody he
[1:13:44] gave us instructions on how to worship
[1:13:49] God he exed Jesus Christ no other
[1:13:54] in this
[1:13:56] day he never glorified
[1:13:59] himself Hallelujah he did something that
[1:14:02] Moses couldn't
[1:14:04] do Hallelujah right the Bible tells us
[1:14:08] Moses glorified himself and because of
[1:14:11] that he didn't cross
[1:14:15] over Hallelujah but not this amen right
[1:14:21] amen did y'all know amen he received
[1:14:24] such a reward the Lord said to brother

[1:14:29] the Old Testament
[1:14:31] prophets you can get in trouble for that
[1:14:34] brother Hallelujah but the truth is the
[1:14:39] truth he was a son of man revealing
[1:14:44] Jes Hallelujah there were times he stood

[1:14:50] he waited and all of a sudden people

[1:15:05] deliver theer
[1:15:09] of come on

[1:15:46] made a trench about the altar as great
[1:15:48] as would contain two measures of seed

[1:45:52] to call it
[1:45:56] lukew what theil he used that word

[1:46:04] yeah beyond
[1:46:07] that come on I know is one of the main
[1:46:10] people that I know of his name was David

[1:46:43] seed amen SE we possess is
[1:46:48] always y'all hear what I'm saying we are
[1:46:51] of a rejected seed and if Christ is
[1:46:54] living in you expect to be
[1:47:02] rejected this you want people to accept
[1:47:04] you this is the time you want him to
[1:47:09] accept is that all right Hebrews 914 I
[1:47:13] don't want to go too longer but he said
[1:47:15] for Christ being come and high priest of
[1:47:17] a good thing to come by a greater and
[1:47:19] more perfect Tabernacle not made with
[1:47:21] hand that is to say not of this building
[1:47:24] neither by the blood of ghost and Cal
[1:47:26] but by his own blood he enter into once
[1:47:29] in the Holy Place having attain for us
[1:47:33] but if the blood of bulls and goats the
[1:47:34] ashes of and he sprinkled the unclean
[1:47:37] Sanctified to the purifying of the flesh
[1:47:39] how much more shall the blood of
[1:47:41] Christ who through the eternal
[1:47:44] spirit there it is the blood of Christ
[1:47:48] is the eternal spirit
[1:47:52] oh I got
[1:47:54] BL
[1:47:57] BL if the eternal spirit which is Jesus
[1:47:59] Christ himself is not involved in your
[1:48:02] life there is no applying of
[1:48:08] the come on somebody how you GNA get
[1:48:12] Sanctified without the Holy Ghost do you
[1:48:15] really think aen that you can clean up
[1:48:18] enough for God to come in it takes God
[1:48:21] who is the perfect one that can sanctify
[1:48:23] you well
[1:48:26] enough amen yes Lord
[1:48:29] GL you said oh brother what are you
[1:48:32] saying I'm saying be understood what
[1:48:34] what this word is saying the Bible say
[1:48:36] when you get the Holy Ghost God don't
[1:48:39] even see how unclean you
[1:48:43] are amen thank you Lord because he's not
[1:48:46] looking at your life he know you going
[1:48:47] to make mistakes but he's looking at the

[1:49:08] word amen to distinguish themselves from
[1:49:10] the Pentecostals like the Pentecostals
[1:49:13] distinguish themselves from each other
[1:49:15] one assembly God says Holy Spirit and
[1:49:17] the other one says holy ghost yeah
[1:49:20] yes we don't want the ghost we take the
[1:49:23] spirit and then we in the message say we
[1:49:26] don't want the Holy Ghost we want the
[1:49:27] token what's the
[1:49:33] difference what is the difference the
[1:49:35] token is the Holy

[2:12:40] the faith to to help us pray he said for
[2:12:43] those of you who need to leave you can
[2:12:47] leave
[2:12:48] he said the whole church
[2:12:51] got and just left a little few people a
[2:12:54] little handful of people to pray what
[2:12:56] kind of stuff is
[2:12:59] that all that shouting and dancing and
[2:13:02] running up and down out and you ain't
[2:13:04] got enough Faith to cast a devil out
[2:13:07] what is a devil it ain't you they
[2:13:09] casting him out it's God's
[2:13:13] word amen God's word will never come
[2:13:16] back for amen
[2:13:20] yes
[2:13:21] sir get so get such in a place where
[2:13:25] yeah brother bam you know you think
[2:13:26] about the maturity of of of the church
[2:13:28] he was trying to bring them to a
[2:13:30] maturity and you say well what brother
[2:13:32] let me ask you a question if they came
[2:13:34] to maturity like he was really trying to
[2:13:35] bring them to maturity what happened to
[2:13:37] random
[2:13:38] Tabernacle
[2:13:41] righten come on let's deal with reality
[2:13:44] that's right what was going on that you
[2:13:47] could have all these does raised up like
[2:13:51] that where is the Holy Ghost amen
[2:13:55] amen y'all hear what I'm saying somebody
[2:13:59] should have been able to catch
[2:14:01] it amen you know you got to be
[2:14:03] circumcised
[2:14:05] yeah you got to be circumcised and and
[2:14:08] and and and Paul said in all the rest of
[2:14:11] the circumcises you yall no good right
[2:14:13] that's right but you was just as nasty
[2:14:15] and dirty as you want to be that's right
[2:14:19] amen you became Hypocrites that's what
[2:14:22] happened
[2:14:25] right but now we need the circumcision
[2:14:27] of the heart amen us Lord help us Lord
[2:14:31] amen we need
[2:14:33] God the Holy Ghost in fire that's what I
[2:14:37] love about Elijah he said Let the
[2:14:41] Fire
[2:14:43] amen
[2:14:45] a right Hallelujah just one more thing
[2:14:50] down in there's a real move of God move
[2:14:54] among the Pentecost they're calling it
[2:14:57] the second ofus hello did you know
[2:15:00] brother said that was gonna happen he
[2:15:02] said the start with them is that right
[2:15:04] because you see the wheat grows faster
[2:15:07] amen and things happen with them faster
[2:15:09] you see what I'm saying so my point is
[2:15:11] if the Holy Ghost is falling upon them
[2:15:14] he said yes they'll think they're
[2:15:16] receiving a Revival but they
[2:15:18] the mark
[2:15:18] [Music]
[2:15:21] of you know why because they've made the
[2:15:24] evidence of the Holy Ghost speaking in
[2:15:27] time oh help us Lord thank God for
[2:15:33] Malachi to make us know that all these
[2:15:35] things you can do all he did was just
[2:15:37] take what Paul said and have not charity
[2:15:40] and propit you nothing so brother B did
[2:15:42] all he did was lift it from the
[2:15:46] scripture and he said with without
[2:15:48] Divine love
[2:15:52] amen didn't say nothing different than
[2:15:55] what he said right and people all I can
[2:15:57] say is like I told the church I said
[2:15:59] we've been such we've been so into these
[2:16:02] Mysteries oh my God know the mystery of
[2:16:07] everything true have you been been more
[2:16:10] converted
[2:16:12] by right oh come on
[2:16:16] somebody you can understand all
[2:16:19] Mysteries that's true see what I'm
[2:16:21] saying first the kingdom of God and his
[2:16:24] righteousness and all of these things
[2:16:26] will be added to us that's right
[2:16:29] hallelujah it's like we around 40 years
[2:16:32] when it could have take seven days get
[2:16:34] where we need to

[2:22:43] devil had a trick up the road was going
[2:22:46] to die
[2:22:48] from an animal to a real Lamb of

[2:22:55] the Lamb of God it didn't stop there

[2:33:44] Lord about how we need to cry out for
[2:33:47] the fire amen Amen brother gave an
[2:33:51] example the time of Moses when they had
[2:33:53] the Exodus the people started crying out
[2:33:57] and God sent a deliverer amen amen
[2:34:00] amen gave example of the vision brother
[2:34:03] Brandon had both wheat and tears were
[2:34:05] crying out for
[2:34:06] rain then you know last Saturday morning
[2:34:09] in Minnesota I preached
[2:34:10] on Gideon they were crying
[2:34:14] yes because of the
[2:34:17] G through and because they cried out
[2:34:19] that said God sent them a prophet

[2:35:12] headphones that are noise counseling
[2:35:13] head noise cancelling headphones
[2:35:18] and the reason I bought those is brother

[2:35:28] sh

[2:35:34] message a wonderful message
[2:35:38] um brother R says you know the church
[2:35:41] has long
[2:35:43] lost the desire for prayer meeting
[2:35:46] amen and he said there's no more
[2:35:48] agonizing in prayer for God to fulfill
[2:35:51] his
[2:35:52] word and after hearing a message like
[2:35:55] you know this
