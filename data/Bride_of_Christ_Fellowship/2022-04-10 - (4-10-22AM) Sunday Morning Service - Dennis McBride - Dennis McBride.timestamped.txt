[35:16] and uh we pray that he meet with us and
[35:18] help us in his word
[35:21] it's been a little while since we've
[35:22] been here but every time we come it's a
[35:24] pleasure
[35:26] and to be amongst good saints and good
[35:28] fellowship and i wish i was able to sit
[35:31] down and hear brother jesse preach
[35:34] amen i thank the god for him and just
[35:37] his life and all so
[35:38] i don't want to keep you standing long
[35:40] so let's pray if we will
[35:42] amen heavenly father
[35:44] lord we thank you for allowing us to be
[35:46] here
[35:48] lord we are your people you know all
[35:50] about us
[35:51] you know exactly what we need and where
[35:53] we are
[35:55] so we just pray lord that you would
[35:57] please come in and just minister to our
[35:59] hearts minister to our needs lord
[36:02] sometimes we think we know what we need
[36:04] father but we don't really know at all
[36:06] so lord may you reveal to us lord
[36:09] give us what you know we stand in need
[36:11] of we pray
[36:13] lord we ask you and forgive us of our
[36:15] sins and our iniquities lord
[36:18] that's why we come here father is to get
[36:20] strength
[36:21] lord to keep moving forward as we were
[36:23] just singing lord to keep pressing the
[36:25] battle lord
[36:27] father we need you and we ask all these
[36:29] things humbly in your name the name of
[36:31] our lord and savior jesus christ amen
[36:36] amen god bless you saints let's go in
[36:38] our bibles
[36:39] i'll keep the initial reading short and
[36:41] then we'll just kind of
[36:43] move as the lord would help us to move
[36:47] isaiah 57
[36:50] and i want to go to verse 15.
[36:54] isaiah 57
[36:56] and verse 15.
[37:00] this has become a very dear subject to
[37:01] my heart
[37:04] and i'm sure it is for all of us but
[37:06] it's just something that's really been
[37:09] emphasized to me here lately for my own
[37:12] good of course and
[37:14] but it applies to the whole body
[37:17] this is something that's very
[37:18] necessary for each member of the body to
[37:22] to be mindful of in our individual lives
[37:25] in order for god to be able to fully
[37:27] have his way
[37:29] so in isaiah 57 and 15 it says
[37:32] for thus saith the high and lofty one
[37:35] that inhabiteth eternity
[37:37] whose name is holy
[37:40] he says i dwell
[37:42] in the high and holy place
[37:45] okay
[37:46] so god is speaking of a place that he
[37:48] abides
[37:50] right
[37:52] but now he's saying that i'm not there
[37:53] alone
[37:55] there's somebody that i'm actually with
[37:58] and this is the person that he's with he
[38:00] says with him also that is of a contrite
[38:03] and a humble spirit
[38:06] that's very important
[38:08] he says to revive the spirit of the
[38:10] humble and to revive the heart of the
[38:12] contrite ones
[38:14] let's just bow once more father help us
[38:17] lord we've read your word now bring it
[38:19] out as you will in jesus christ's name
[38:21] we ask it amen
[38:24] you may be seated saints
[38:28] and i'm gonna read this scripture once
[38:30] more because it's the
[38:33] the focal point of what we're going to
[38:34] be dealing with this morning
[38:40] 57-15 of isaiah again it says for thus
[38:43] saith the high and lofty one
[38:45] that inhabiteth eternity whose name is
[38:48] holy i dwell in the high
[38:50] and holy place
[38:52] with him
[38:53] also that is of a contrite and humble
[38:56] spirit
[38:57] to revive the spirit of the humble and
[38:59] to revive the heart of the contrite ones
[39:03] also i want to go to first peter chapter
[39:05] 5
[39:10] and verse 5.
[39:16] it says likewise you younger submit
[39:18] yourselves unto the elder
[39:20] yea all of you be subject one to another
[39:24] you know
[39:25] within a world that we live in
[39:28] one thing i've noticed
[39:30] and i'm sure i'm not the only one you've
[39:32] probably encountered it also in your
[39:34] lifetimes
[39:36] many people have a problem with
[39:37] authority
[39:41] like everybody want to be a boss
[39:44] you know
[39:45] at work nobody want a manager over them
[39:47] they want to be able to do whatever they
[39:49] want to do
[39:51] and sadly to say but just
[39:53] you know many people have that that type
[39:55] issue
[39:57] where it's hard for them to be subject
[39:59] to someone else
[40:01] but the bible is saying here it says yea
[40:03] all of you be subject one to another
[40:08] you see now what is that really speaking
[40:10] about see because we're we're not
[40:11] talking about us humbling ourselves to a
[40:14] man per se
[40:15] right but there's a portion of god
[40:17] within each one of us isn't that right
[40:19] and god works through his body
[40:22] you know like for instance brother jesse
[40:24] is the pastor of the church
[40:26] and he didn't put himself in that role
[40:27] god put him there
[40:29] right so what god will do because he
[40:31] placed it because he placed him there
[40:33] and he put that gift in his life god
[40:35] will speak through him to each one of us
[40:38] isn't that right and sometimes god might
[40:39] give an instruction
[40:41] isn't that right but if we're not in the
[40:43] right space mentally i mean spiritually
[40:45] speaking we'll look at a man and we
[40:47] wouldn't want to
[40:49] as we would say obey what a man is
[40:51] saying not knowing that that's not that
[40:52] man but that's god veiling himself
[40:56] right
[40:56] and god can work through each member of
[40:58] the body in that way
[41:00] isn't that right god can speak through a
[41:02] child
[41:03] to an adult
[41:05] but if it's the voice of god then we
[41:07] must humble ourselves to him isn't that
[41:09] right but notice what it says on here
[41:13] it says and i like this part saints
[41:16] it says in be clothed
[41:18] with humility
[41:22] amen it says be clothed with it
[41:24] and that means you're wearing it like a
[41:26] garment
[41:28] and we want to get into what humility
[41:29] really is
[41:31] right let's be clothed with humility it
[41:34] says for god resisteth the proud
[41:38] right
[41:40] he says but he gives grace it says to
[41:42] the humble it says humble yourselves
[41:44] therefore under the mighty hand of god
[41:47] and then as a result of that it says he
[41:49] may exalt you
[41:50] in due time
[41:52] it's not us exalting ourselves but we
[41:54] actually wait on him and allow him to do
[41:57] in our lives whatever he wills at
[41:59] whatever time he wills to do it
[42:02] all right so as a subject this morning i
[42:04] wanna
[42:06] it presses us
[42:08] to limits and into places that are very
[42:11] uncomfortable
[42:12] yes sir isn't that right each one of us
[42:15] experienced that many of us might be
[42:17] going through that right now
[42:19] you know but it's all it's all for a
[42:21] purpose it's all it's all it's all
[42:23] serving a divine purpose
[42:25] with it's within each one of our lives
[42:27] god has to keep us or get us in a place
[42:31] right to where he can actually use us to
[42:33] his glory
[42:35] amen right
[42:37] now whenever now now god can't do that
[42:39] unless there's first of all a certain
[42:41] mindset that's there right a certain way
[42:45] to god that god has to help us to view
[42:47] ourselves
[42:49] right
[42:50] now just to kind of help delay a
[42:52] background here
[42:54] it says here in romans chapter 12 and
[42:57] verse 3. i'm talking about the place of
[43:00] power
[43:01] right
[43:03] in romans 12 and verse 3 it says for i
[43:05] say through the grace given unto me to
[43:08] every man that is among you to
[43:11] right this is the holy spirit speaking
[43:13] through paul
[43:15] and he's addressing something to the
[43:16] entire church
[43:18] right there's some need for that god
[43:20] knew that you you have you have to keep
[43:22] this in mind
[43:23] because amongst man especially when you
[43:25] have a wrong nature very easily you can
[43:28] kind of get into a place to where you
[43:30] think more of yourself than what you
[43:32] should so god is encouraging his church
[43:34] through his his apostle and his prophet
[43:36] he says not to think of himself more
[43:39] highly than he ought to think
[43:42] he says but to think soberly according
[43:44] as god has dealt to every man the
[43:46] measure of faith
[43:48] so god is not interested in us thinking
[43:51] more of ourselves than what we should
[43:54] all right there is something here i want
[43:55] to kind of bring in at this point that
[43:58] is a very key point that the lord
[43:59] allowed our prophet to make in a message
[44:02] called perfect strength and perfect
[44:03] weakness he says the important thing he
[44:06] says one of the important things that he
[44:08] says we must master
[44:13] all right
[44:14] now i know brother vang he he deals with
[44:17] the cnc machines
[44:20] right
[44:21] you know uh comparing to myself he would
[44:24] see he would be considered a master
[44:26] of of of the cnc machines and don't
[44:29] you also you run cnc machines right
[44:32] our brother austin he has a different
[44:34] type occupation but compared to me he's
[44:37] a master of his occupation
[44:39] meaning it's something that he's
[44:41] actually put time into
[44:43] to come to understand to the full extent
[44:46] of it and to perfect the craft of it
[44:49] isn't that right there's different
[44:51] people that hold different positions
[44:53] within here right
[44:55] but now whenever we have a job to do
[44:57] right we dedicate ourselves to that job
[44:59] we study what we need to study so that
[45:02] we can apply everything we need to apply
[45:04] to that job so that we can do it to the
[45:06] best of our abilities
[45:08] isn't that right so god is speaking
[45:10] through his prophet and he said all of
[45:12] us there's one thing we must master
[45:17] means you have to apply thought to it
[45:20] you got to meditate upon it it's
[45:22] something you got to keep in the
[45:23] foremost part of your mind
[45:26] it's something you can't lose sight of
[45:28] because it's something listen now this
[45:30] isn't just a man speaking to us
[45:32] this is god speaking his own thoughts
[45:34] telling us how he needs for us to
[45:36] operate and what place he needs for us
[45:38] to be in
[45:40] now what is this thing he's saying that
[45:41] we must master he says now remember this
[45:45] and especially you young preachers but
[45:47] not preachers only he says and lay
[45:49] members alike
[45:52] right he says here there's one thing
[45:54] that we've got to master if we expect
[45:57] this is the main key saints if we expect
[46:00] to fulfill god's desire in our life
[46:05] now how many want to know their purpose
[46:08] how many one of their purpose in the
[46:10] body of christ
[46:12] some of you might have a glimpse of it
[46:13] already you might say well man it seems
[46:15] like god want to use me in this way that
[46:17] way or the other and that very thing you
[46:20] might see or feel you see might be true
[46:22] right but in order for god to fully
[46:25] bring you into that position into that
[46:28] role into that purpose that you might be
[46:30] of benefit to the body
[46:33] because when god brings us into a
[46:35] purpose it's not just for us to kind of
[46:38] have some kind of a glory of our own
[46:41] you understand what i'm saying
[46:43] and that's the mentality god got to get
[46:45] away from us so when somebody is too
[46:47] desirous to do something
[46:51] you got to be careful of that
[46:54] because then what you can inject within
[46:56] that is your own human ability
[46:59] meaning you feel like i feel like i got
[47:01] what it take brother
[47:04] be it brother or sister i feel i got
[47:07] what it take to get this job over if you
[47:10] feel like you got what it takes you
[47:12] ain't ready yet to get into that
[47:13] position
[47:15] because in order for you to operate and
[47:17] that is god alone it has to actually
[47:19] operate through you
[47:21] you understand what i'm saying so the
[47:23] whole point is to yield to god and
[47:25] realize lord i can't do listen
[47:28] we'll just let the scripture speak for
[47:29] itself
[47:30] right
[47:31] in the in the book of john
[47:34] amen scripture we already know but it's
[47:35] for the sake of everybody let's just
[47:37] read it john 15 and verse 4.
[47:40] amen it says abide in me and i knew
[47:44] as the branch cannot bear fruit
[47:48] of itself
[47:50] right he says accept except it abide in
[47:54] the vine he says no more can ye except
[47:56] you abide in me i am the vine and ye are
[47:59] the branches he that abideth in me and i
[48:01] in him the same bringeth forth much
[48:03] fruit he says for without me he can do
[48:06] how much
[48:09] so how many of us brought ourselves to
[48:11] church this morning
[48:13] let me see your hands
[48:18] how many how many of ourselves how many
[48:20] of us woke ourselves up this morning
[48:24] let me see your hands
[48:27] did your alarm wake you up
[48:31] if you did you can't hear an alarm can
[48:33] you
[48:34] so who enabled life to come inside of
[48:36] each one of us this morning that we
[48:38] might be able to wake up who is it that
[48:40] actually woke us up who is it that is
[48:42] enabling our eyes right now to be able
[48:44] to see the preacher up here right now
[48:46] are you causing yourself to see
[48:49] is it because of how many carrots you
[48:50] ate
[48:53] that's what they do right he cares to
[48:55] try to improve the site
[48:56] that's one way right
[48:58] you understand what i'm saying no you
[49:00] didn't do any of these things for
[49:01] yourselves and you never did our whole
[49:04] lives god has been the one blessing us
[49:06] with every day of our lives and every
[49:08] functioning part of our body has come
[49:10] from god
[49:11] but how many people wake up every day
[49:14] and feel like they're the ones that's in
[49:15] control of their own lives
[49:18] they woke themselves up they gave
[49:20] themselves food they give themselves
[49:22] money no god is the one
[49:25] you understand what i'm saying no matter
[49:26] what position you have as far as
[49:28] career-wise who gave you that job
[49:32] and even even for the job you have who
[49:34] who enabled you to comprehend what you
[49:36] needed to comprehend in order for you to
[49:38] be able to do that job that you do
[49:41] is it because you were so smart
[49:43] no god is the one that gives you the
[49:45] ability to understand and to do whatever
[49:48] it is in life that you can do isn't that
[49:50] the right sense
[49:51] so what's the real source of everything
[49:53] that we have it's god
[49:58] but many times
[50:00] we're not always mindful of that like we
[50:02] should be
[50:04] let's go to the book of daniel chapter
[50:06] four
[50:08] now i'm saying these things because this
[50:10] is something that's very important to
[50:11] god no matter where you are right now
[50:13] who you are right now
[50:15] this one thing has to become a
[50:17] foundation in every one of our lives
[50:22] but it's nothing that we have to make a
[50:24] foundation god is here to he's he's
[50:26] already working in that way i believe in
[50:28] our lives before we get done with this
[50:30] service i believe you'll understand why
[50:32] you go through all the things that you
[50:34] go through
[50:35] amen
[50:37] it's for a purpose
[50:39] now in daniel chapter 4 just to show an
[50:41] example of how important this is to god
[50:44] it says in verse 30 the king spoke now
[50:47] this is king nebuchadnezzar
[50:49] all right
[50:50] now all of our young people i know this
[50:52] is going to capture your attention
[50:54] all right it says the king spake and
[50:57] said
[50:58] is this now notice how the king is
[50:59] speaking
[51:01] this is king nebuchadnezzar
[51:04] king over babylon
[51:05] at this time the greatest kingdom in the
[51:07] earth
[51:09] won many victories amen a very
[51:11] flourishing kingdom amen very powerful
[51:14] king
[51:15] nobody could lay a hand to
[51:16] nebuchadnezzar
[51:18] you understand
[51:20] but nebuchadnezzar he did he he made he
[51:22] made a very
[51:23] very bad mistake
[51:26] notice this now
[51:28] listen to him in his mistake that he
[51:30] allowed the devil to bring him into and
[51:32] if we're not careful satan to come into
[51:34] every one of our lives and try to bring
[51:36] us into this same mistake
[51:39] it says the king spake and said is not
[51:41] this great babylon notice that i have
[51:44] built
[51:48] god allow us to have a little success of
[51:50] some kind
[51:52] and now all of a sudden we want to
[51:53] account it to being ourselves
[51:56] well i'm a pretty good i'm i'm a pretty
[51:58] good employee yo i'm a pretty good
[52:01] business owner i'm a pretty good
[52:03] electrician i'm a pretty good whatever
[52:05] pretty good that might be
[52:07] you understand what i'm saying and for
[52:09] that moment you're kind of glorying
[52:12] in something that that really
[52:15] you actually catching god attention is
[52:17] what you're doing
[52:18] because notice this now the king was
[52:20] saying this he wasn't saying this
[52:22] allowed per se
[52:24] this was just thoughts that he was
[52:26] having of himself
[52:29] in his own life his perspective that he
[52:31] came to of of how it is all these things
[52:34] came about that was taking place within
[52:36] his kingdom he says this great babylon
[52:38] he says that i have built for the house
[52:41] of the kingdom by the might of my power
[52:45] wow
[52:47] you know how many people were in the
[52:48] earth at this time
[52:51] there was millions of people in the
[52:52] earth at this time this king was saying
[52:54] there's all types of situations going on
[52:56] at this time that this king was saying
[52:58] this but because this king was saying
[53:00] this like he was saying it he drew the
[53:02] attention of god straight to himself
[53:05] watch this
[53:07] he says by the king he's by the might of
[53:09] my power and for the honor of my majesty
[53:12] he says while the word was in the king's
[53:15] mouth
[53:18] so while he was sitting there saying all
[53:21] of these things
[53:22] while it was yet in his mouth it says
[53:24] there fell a voice from heaven
[53:28] see he thought he was somebody
[53:32] he was a king
[53:33] there was nobody in the earth at that
[53:35] time that could lay a finger on him
[53:38] his his word the bible says where the
[53:39] king with the word of a king in there is
[53:41] power
[53:42] his word had power
[53:44] you understand
[53:46] but now here it is he lost track he lost
[53:48] sight of who really was the source of
[53:51] everything that he had of whose power it
[53:54] was that established him in that kingdom
[53:57] who made him a king
[53:59] the bible says god says by me kings rule
[54:02] prince's rule and king's reign
[54:05] god sets up who we want to set up and he
[54:07] brings down who he wanna brings down
[54:11] and he doesn't take kindly to somebody
[54:13] all of a sudden feel like uh rather
[54:15] forgetting about him like that so the
[54:17] bible says while the word was yet in the
[54:19] king's mouth he wasn't even to finish
[54:21] and he was able to finish his thought
[54:23] completely
[54:24] a voice came down from heaven and what
[54:26] did that voice say saints o king
[54:29] nebuchadnezzar to thee it is spoken the
[54:31] kingdom is departed from me
[54:34] so while he was giving himself honor and
[54:37] majesty and glory god had to come down
[54:40] and teach nebuchadnezzar a lesson
[54:43] you're glorying in yourself you feel
[54:46] like you did all of this oh it's your
[54:47] kingdom by your power i'm telling you
[54:49] right now i'm taking the kingdom away
[54:51] from you right now you are no longer
[54:53] king at this moment
[54:55] right
[54:59] wow
[55:02] you understand that sometimes god when
[55:04] we
[55:05] lose sight of who he is in our lives
[55:08] he'll come in immediately
[55:11] and he'll allow failures to take place
[55:18] why is he doing it though
[55:21] let's read on down
[55:24] while the word was in the king's mouth
[55:26] there fell a voice from heaven saying oh
[55:27] king nebuchadnezzar to thee it is spoken
[55:30] the kingdom is departed from me
[55:32] he says and then shall i watch
[55:35] you thought you were so you thought you
[55:37] were so mighty
[55:38] you thought you were so secure
[55:41] you thought because of your doings
[55:42] you're the one that's in this position
[55:44] in the way that you are
[55:46] but now i gotta teach you something
[55:47] never connected i got to show you that
[55:50] none of this is by your own power but
[55:52] it's by my power alone
[55:54] and to make sure you understand this not
[55:57] only am i telling you i'm taking the
[55:58] kingdom away from you i'ma let your own
[56:01] people drive you out
[56:05] see god really wanted him to understand
[56:07] something
[56:09] so i'm dethroning you nebuchadnezzar
[56:12] and i'm letting your own people drive
[56:14] you out of your own kingdom
[56:17] isn't that something saints
[56:19] and he comes on down he says and they
[56:21] shall drive thee from men and thy
[56:23] dwelling shall be with the beast of the
[56:25] field
[56:26] so not only am i going to drive you out
[56:28] from your own kingdom i'm gonna make you
[56:30] go out and live like an animal
[56:33] you're not gonna be able to go back to
[56:35] your path you right you gotta you got a
[56:36] palace that's right there nebuchadnezzar
[56:39] but by your own power you can't even
[56:40] walk back to your palace
[56:42] amen i'm keeping you from going back to
[56:44] your chambers and i'm gonna make you
[56:46] live out there with the animals day and
[56:48] night
[56:51] and not only am i gonna make you live
[56:52] with the animals i'm gonna make you eat
[56:54] like an animal
[56:56] you're not gonna be able to enjoy the
[56:57] grapes and the nice meats and things you
[57:00] were used to
[57:01] now i'm gonna make you kneel down on
[57:03] your hands and knees i'm gonna make you
[57:05] make your mouth go down and eat grass
[57:09] as the oxen
[57:13] god got a way of humbling a person
[57:16] you see he said he don't want nobody to
[57:18] think of to think of themselves above
[57:20] what they ought to
[57:21] isn't that right
[57:23] so why is god doing this god is doing
[57:25] this for his own good
[57:28] let's go on saints
[57:30] he says and thy dwelling shall be with
[57:32] the beast of the field and he says and
[57:34] they shall make thee to eat grass as
[57:36] oxen and seven times will pass over thee
[57:38] until until thou know this is the main
[57:42] point until thou know that the most high
[57:44] ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth
[57:47] it to whomsoever he will
[57:50] you got a little amnesia never
[57:53] but i have to deal with you to this
[57:55] extent to bring you out of that place
[57:57] that you've drifted into
[57:59] so that you come to this one
[58:01] understanding you ain't nobody my friend
[58:04] hey man i'm the one that gave you the
[58:06] position i'm the one that calls you to
[58:08] flourish it had nothing to do with none
[58:10] of your own abilities
[58:13] and our prophet taught us that we must
[58:15] master
[58:17] amen
[58:18] just so just so we don't lose sight of
[58:20] this there's one thing that we've got to
[58:22] master if we expect to fulfill god's
[58:25] desire in our life that is we have to
[58:28] master the thought of human ability
[58:30] if we ever get to a spot where we think
[58:33] that we can do it within our own
[58:35] intelligence or our own abilities we've
[58:37] got to master that in such a way that we
[58:40] got to get rid of the thing and lay
[58:42] aside so that god that god can use us he
[58:45] says that's right
[58:48] in order for god to use us we can't have
[58:50] no thoughts of our own selves in that
[58:52] way
[58:53] we can't think that that because i'm i'm
[58:56] so good at this or i have the ability to
[58:58] do this out of the up even down to the
[59:00] housewife
[59:02] hey man you can't have such a thought of
[59:04] yourself i'm such a good housewife who
[59:06] enables you to be able to cook like you
[59:08] cook
[59:09] right right huh
[59:11] is it because you can read or follow
[59:13] youtube videos so well or whatever
[59:16] you understand what i'm saying no it's
[59:18] god that enables you to be able to cook
[59:20] like you cook it's god that enables you
[59:22] to be able to be a homemaker
[59:24] isn't that right it's god that puts a
[59:26] desire in a man's heart to go out and
[59:28] work for his family you understand you
[59:30] understand what i'm saying
[59:32] every area of our lives depends
[59:34] completely on god and god wants us to
[59:36] understand this one thing so that we can
[59:39] be solely dependent upon him
[59:42] and when we're in that place that's the
[59:44] real place of power
[59:47] but we are totally depending on god lord
[59:49] you are the source of everything that i
[59:51] have and everything i ever will have
[59:57] and in that place right there
[59:59] that's when we can really be a benefit
[1:00:01] to one another
[1:00:03] because now it's not anything that's
[1:00:05] coming from a man's intellect or a man's
[1:00:07] free of failing abilities within himself
[1:00:10] but now there is a supply that's going
[1:00:12] to every part of god's body by the
[1:00:14] spirit of god from one member to another
[1:00:18] that's when we're able to come together
[1:00:19] brother and get straight from one
[1:00:21] another when god is in the midst of us
[1:00:23] of a humble people that's clothed with
[1:00:25] humility and able to flow through
[1:00:28] now your mind ain't your mind no more
[1:00:30] it's the mind of god now god is sitting
[1:00:32] there amongst us speaking life into each
[1:00:35] member of the body through the mouths of
[1:00:37] men
[1:00:38] that have been humbled before god
[1:00:41] and now god is able to have his way
[1:00:43] amongst his body
[1:00:45] that's what's taking place right now
[1:00:48] can we say praise the lord
[1:00:50] amen saints
[1:00:52] amen i like this
[1:00:55] amen this is such a blessing to my soul
[1:00:58] amen because i see the need of it
[1:01:00] praise the lord
[1:01:03] now let's go if we will to first
[1:01:04] corinthians chapter 12.
[1:01:08] first corinthians chapter 12.
[1:01:11] and i want to start at verse 1.
[1:01:15] because here's one of the men
[1:01:17] that throughout all time
[1:01:20] although there are many mighty and great
[1:01:24] when i say mighty and great me and
[1:01:25] brother jesse was talking about this the
[1:01:27] other day
[1:01:28] you know when we talk about somebody
[1:01:30] being mighty or great we're not exalting
[1:01:32] any man or woman
[1:01:33] right
[1:01:34] it's just people that have learned to
[1:01:36] yield to the spirit of god
[1:01:38] through the lessons that god has taught
[1:01:40] them in their lives
[1:01:42] and now god is able to show himself
[1:01:44] forth
[1:01:45] through each individual that's in that
[1:01:47] state
[1:01:48] and they're able to be a great help to
[1:01:50] other members of the body isn't that
[1:01:52] right
[1:01:53] so paul is one of these people
[1:01:56] right
[1:01:57] but notice god took paul through such
[1:01:59] lessons in life
[1:02:01] to bring him to a place
[1:02:04] let's just read here verse 1 says
[1:02:07] it is not expedient for me doubtless to
[1:02:09] glory
[1:02:10] he says i will come to visions and
[1:02:11] revelations of the lord
[1:02:13] i knew a man in christ above 14 years
[1:02:16] ago
[1:02:17] notice how he says this now he says i
[1:02:20] know he's i knew a man in christ
[1:02:26] and when i first started reading the
[1:02:27] bible and i read this for the first time
[1:02:29] i thought paul who paul talking
[1:02:33] who about this man he talking about here
[1:02:36] i mean he realized he was talking about
[1:02:38] himself
[1:02:40] but he was being so delicate in the way
[1:02:42] that he expressed these things
[1:02:45] because of the place that god had
[1:02:47] brought him to
[1:02:48] the last thing paul wanted to do is for
[1:02:51] any to cause anybody to think more of
[1:02:53] himself than what they should
[1:02:56] so out of a true heart of humility
[1:02:59] this brother was afraid to even mention
[1:03:01] that it was him that had these
[1:03:03] experiences
[1:03:05] he was so careful with his words he
[1:03:07] rather you think it was someone else
[1:03:10] amen
[1:03:13] you understand
[1:03:15] you know sometimes when
[1:03:18] please take this in the right way
[1:03:20] sometimes you know when
[1:03:22] certain things happen you know god might
[1:03:24] use you to do a certain thing and
[1:03:26] whatever you know
[1:03:27] sometimes i ain't saying it happens here
[1:03:29] but sometimes people can't wait to tell
[1:03:31] somebody
[1:03:32] what god used them to do
[1:03:36] let me tell you what happened brother i
[1:03:38] was such and such place man and a lo you
[1:03:40] know the lord used me to lay hands on
[1:03:42] this person and when i prayed for this
[1:03:45] person i'm telling you man a
[1:03:47] lightning flash and a thundercrack and
[1:03:49] man a light and they just got up here
[1:03:53] glory to god
[1:03:56] but in the bible
[1:03:57] now listen
[1:04:00] because christ don't change right right
[1:04:02] in the bible when christ would heal
[1:04:04] people
[1:04:05] you know one thing he would actually do
[1:04:07] he'll go to the person that he healed
[1:04:09] and he says see that you tell no man
[1:04:11] about it
[1:04:17] here he is god
[1:04:19] and whenever he did something he
[1:04:21] actually encouraged the person it was
[1:04:23] done to don't tell nobody about it
[1:04:27] the bible says he made himself of no
[1:04:28] reputation
[1:04:31] he said behold i am meek and lowly and
[1:04:33] hard
[1:04:34] you understand what i'm saying when god
[1:04:37] chose to manifest himself he made he
[1:04:39] manifested himself in a body
[1:04:42] that nobody could even they they had no
[1:04:45] thought that that was god housing that
[1:04:46] kind of a body
[1:04:49] why would he make a body for himself
[1:04:50] like that
[1:04:51] the bible says there was no beauty that
[1:04:53] we should desire
[1:04:55] he didn't make himself in a way to be
[1:04:57] very noticeable or seen like that
[1:05:00] but he was the kind that just kind of
[1:05:01] walked about in the shadows but yet he
[1:05:04] was god manifested in the flesh
[1:05:07] you understand what i'm saying
[1:05:12] so paul
[1:05:13] this same christ now he abides in paul
[1:05:17] and now he's caught he's brought paul
[1:05:18] he's molded paul to a place
[1:05:21] where paul knew he was nothing
[1:05:24] and he was very careful and how he
[1:05:26] communicated anything
[1:05:27] to make sure that one thing always was
[1:05:30] covered that he was not exalting himself
[1:05:32] and neither was he causing anybody else
[1:05:34] to exalt him in ignorance
[1:05:38] so this is why he's taking such care to
[1:05:40] make this statement like this amen
[1:05:43] he says i knew a man in christ above 14
[1:05:47] years ago whether in the body i cannot
[1:05:49] tell or whether out of the body i cannot
[1:05:51] tell god noah he says such a one was
[1:05:53] called up to the third heaven he says
[1:05:56] and i knew such a man whether in the
[1:05:57] body or out of the body i cannot tell
[1:05:59] god noah how that he was caught up into
[1:06:02] paradise and heard unspeakable words
[1:06:04] which is not lawful for a man not utter
[1:06:07] he says of such a one will i glory yet
[1:06:09] of myself i will not glory he's still
[1:06:11] talking about himself the whole time
[1:06:16] but this brother had entered he entered
[1:06:17] into this place of power
[1:06:23] he says but in mind infirmity so he said
[1:06:25] i'm not going to glory within the things
[1:06:28] that god has allowed me to experience
[1:06:30] but what i'm going to glory in is in my
[1:06:32] infirmities or my weaknesses
[1:06:36] because he understood now by god's grace
[1:06:39] what these weaknesses meant to his life
[1:06:43] how many of us have weaknesses
[1:06:46] now the devil has a way he wants us to
[1:06:48] view our weaknesses
[1:06:51] amen
[1:06:54] i'm gonna forerun myself a little bit
[1:06:56] i'm talking about the place of power
[1:06:58] right
[1:06:59] but i want you to understand that when
[1:07:01] you're in this place of power you don't
[1:07:02] feel powerful
[1:07:05] amen
[1:07:10] with that being said
[1:07:12] let's let's read this particular
[1:07:13] scripture here real quick i want to go
[1:07:15] to hebrews chapter 11.
[1:07:18] just to bring this in
[1:07:21] in this place of power that i'm talking
[1:07:22] about saints
[1:07:24] you don't feel powerful
[1:07:26] you don't feel that encouraged
[1:07:28] you might even feel discouraged
[1:07:31] amen
[1:07:33] you might even feel hopeless helpless
[1:07:36] amen
[1:07:37] but how many realize that's the exact
[1:07:39] place god need for you and i to be
[1:07:42] why because it's not by human ability
[1:07:45] it's not by your own powers not by your
[1:07:47] own mind it's not by your own
[1:07:49] intellect
[1:07:51] amen it's completely by his spirit
[1:07:54] amen he says not by pike nor by mouth
[1:07:56] but by my spirit saith the lord
[1:07:59] isn't that right
[1:08:02] it says here in hebrews and i want to
[1:08:04] come down for the sake of cutting the
[1:08:05] reading short
[1:08:07] the bible says here in uh
[1:08:13] let's go down to verse 32 it says and
[1:08:16] what shall i say more for the time would
[1:08:18] fail me to tell of gideon and barack and
[1:08:21] samson he says and of japheth and of
[1:08:23] david and samuel and of the prophets
[1:08:26] notice how it says this who through
[1:08:27] faith subdue kingdoms wrought
[1:08:30] righteousness obtain promises it says
[1:08:32] stop the mouths of lions
[1:08:35] who was it that stopped the miles of
[1:08:37] lions
[1:08:39] how many would want to be in the place
[1:08:40] of daniel
[1:08:42] young people how many want to how many
[1:08:44] would want to be in the place of daniel
[1:08:46] but you were being let down in a lion's
[1:08:48] den
[1:08:50] huh
[1:08:51] i wouldn't put myself in that situation
[1:08:53] that's for sure
[1:08:55] uh-huh
[1:08:57] you know there's people you probably
[1:08:58] seen it on youtube before there's people
[1:09:00] that have gone and ignorance and their
[1:09:02] own ability want to be like daniel
[1:09:05] and they've actually gone to the zoo and
[1:09:06] jumped down into the lion's den
[1:09:09] proclaiming jesus christ
[1:09:12] but the lord didn't tell them to do that
[1:09:15] you understand what i'm saying they were
[1:09:17] just enthused
[1:09:19] read the story of the bible and want to
[1:09:20] go and be like daniel but daniel didn't
[1:09:22] put himself in that situation
[1:09:24] amen but because now listen the lord
[1:09:27] allowed daniel though to be put into
[1:09:29] that situation
[1:09:30] right but why because god was going to
[1:09:32] get glory out of that situation because
[1:09:35] daniel was totally dependent upon god
[1:09:38] dang listen daniel had become anointed
[1:09:42] daniel should have been screaming and
[1:09:43] kicking and and clawing for his life
[1:09:46] isn't that right
[1:09:47] but because of his position and in
[1:09:48] relationship with god he was trusting
[1:09:51] god's saints
[1:09:52] amen and he allowed himself to be bound
[1:09:55] up he allowed himself to be lowered down
[1:09:57] in there and the bible says it was by
[1:09:59] faith that the mouths of those lions
[1:10:01] were stopped
[1:10:04] but it wasn't because he was such a
[1:10:05] strong man see sampson was able to go
[1:10:07] and take a line and tear him apart
[1:10:09] isn't that right but that's not the
[1:10:11] anointing that was upon daniel
[1:10:14] but yet the anointing that was upon him
[1:10:16] allowed a power to be released that shut
[1:10:19] the mouths of the lions
[1:10:21] when you in this place of power you
[1:10:23] enable god to be able to move like that
[1:10:26] to bring about the supernatural in our
[1:10:28] lives in whatever way we might need we
[1:10:31] might stand in need of isn't that right
[1:10:34] amen he goes on to say
[1:10:36] amen
[1:10:38] women receive their dead raised to life
[1:10:40] again
[1:10:43] hey man remember the woman that was a
[1:10:45] widow woman not a widow woman she had a
[1:10:47] husband but she was barren
[1:10:50] back in the days of elijah
[1:10:52] isn't that right
[1:10:53] and that woman she desired a child
[1:10:56] and god acts you know is there anything
[1:10:58] that you need
[1:11:00] right
[1:11:01] and then he knew by god's grace she
[1:11:03] needed a child
[1:11:04] so god blessed her with a child isn't
[1:11:06] that right
[1:11:07] but after after a while the child got a
[1:11:10] little older than whatever and the lord
[1:11:11] allowed the child to die
[1:11:14] isn't that right and when that child
[1:11:16] died
[1:11:17] that woman was in a place of power
[1:11:20] you understand what i'm saying
[1:11:22] she knew there was nothing she can do
[1:11:24] about it but her mind went straight
[1:11:25] because she was anointed her mind went
[1:11:27] straight to the man of god and she took
[1:11:30] her child and laid her child down on the
[1:11:32] bed of the man of god and then she told
[1:11:34] her husband to go and cause one of the
[1:11:36] servants to come so he can go for a walk
[1:11:38] for ruin her and she went behind the
[1:11:40] servant they got in contact with elijah
[1:11:42] and elijah asked her he was like it's
[1:11:44] all well with these all well with the
[1:11:46] child
[1:11:48] even though her child was dead back in
[1:11:50] the bed of the prophet
[1:11:52] she said all is well
[1:11:55] right amen
[1:11:56] what was that saint she was anointed her
[1:11:59] faith was anointed she was depending
[1:12:01] upon god
[1:12:03] in a time of need amen
[1:12:06] and god by his grace moved through his
[1:12:07] prophet to go back with her and the life
[1:12:09] was brought back into her child again
[1:12:12] by faith women received their dad back
[1:12:14] to life again
[1:12:17] amen
[1:12:19] it says and others were tortured now
[1:12:20] notice what god made his people subject
[1:12:22] to
[1:12:24] it says others were tortured
[1:12:26] many people don't think that the
[1:12:27] children of god need to go through
[1:12:29] anything
[1:12:31] but why was god doing these things
[1:12:33] because he was working what what was
[1:12:34] necessary within each one of these
[1:12:36] individuals lives
[1:12:38] to bring them to a place of total
[1:12:40] dependency that he might get glory out
[1:12:42] of their lives
[1:12:45] praise the lord
[1:12:48] he says questify the the the the
[1:12:51] violence of fire escapes the earth the
[1:12:53] edge of the sword uh out of weakness
[1:12:56] when made strong it says wax valiant and
[1:12:58] fight and fight and turn to flight the
[1:13:00] armies of the aliens receive their dead
[1:13:03] women received their dead rays to life
[1:13:05] again and others were tortured not
[1:13:07] accepting deliverance that they might
[1:13:08] obtain a better resurrection it said and
[1:13:11] others had trial of cruel mockings and
[1:13:13] scourgings yay moreover of bonds and
[1:13:15] imprisonment he says they were stoned
[1:13:18] these are the people of god now it says
[1:13:20] they were stoned they were sawn asunder
[1:13:23] they were tempted they were slain with
[1:13:25] the sword they wanted about in
[1:13:27] sheepskins and goat skins
[1:13:31] isn't that something that's a very hard
[1:13:33] life to live isn't it
[1:13:34] but yet these were the people of god
[1:13:37] amen it says being destitute afflicted
[1:13:40] and tormented of whom the bible says the
[1:13:43] world was not worthy they wandered in
[1:13:45] deserts and in mountains and indians and
[1:13:47] in caves of the earth they didn't even
[1:13:49] have a decent place to stay
[1:13:52] now why would god allow all this to
[1:13:54] happen to his people
[1:13:57] it's because he was working within their
[1:13:59] lives and allowing to be placed within
[1:14:02] the past of their lives what was
[1:14:04] necessary to bring them to this place
[1:14:06] that we're reading of right now
[1:14:09] as we're able to read this here we're
[1:14:11] reading of the testimonies of the power
[1:14:14] and the grace of god that was working
[1:14:16] within these people's lives
[1:14:18] you understand what i'm saying there was
[1:14:20] something that needed to come to an
[1:14:21] expression
[1:14:22] but how could it have come to an
[1:14:24] expression unless these cases were there
[1:14:27] yes you understand what i'm saying
[1:14:29] so the unfortunate
[1:14:32] the things that that aren't so pleasing
[1:14:34] to us
[1:14:35] that take place in our lives god allows
[1:14:37] for every bit of it to be there
[1:14:40] what does it do it puts us into this
[1:14:42] place of total dependency and leniency
[1:14:44] upon him
[1:14:45] to allow his power to work in our lives
[1:14:48] so that the purpose that we he we are
[1:14:50] here for can be fully carried out
[1:14:54] it doesn't feel good amen it's not a
[1:14:57] desirous place to be
[1:14:58] but it's the very place of power that
[1:15:01] god needs for you and i to be in in
[1:15:03] order for him to get glory to himself
[1:15:06] and to really work everything according
[1:15:08] to his perfect will in our lives
[1:15:11] can we say praise the lord saints
[1:15:14] so i want to go back now
[1:15:16] to this particular scripture we read in
[1:15:18] isaiah 57.
[1:15:22] it says for thus saith the high and the
[1:15:24] lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose
[1:15:26] name is holy i dwell in the high and
[1:15:29] holy place he says with him that is of a
[1:15:32] contrite and humble spirit he says to
[1:15:35] revive the spirit of the humble and to
[1:15:37] revive the heart of the contrite ones
[1:15:39] now what does that word contrite means i
[1:15:41] want to show it to you in the hebrew and
[1:15:43] then and then we'll bring it from
[1:15:44] webster's dictionary so the word
[1:15:47] contrite in the hebrew it means to be
[1:15:49] crushed
[1:15:51] it means to be dejected
[1:15:54] it means to be broken
[1:15:56] it means to be beaten to pieces
[1:16:00] it means to be humbled
[1:16:03] now we just read in the new testament he
[1:16:05] says yeah all of you be clothed
[1:16:08] with humility
[1:16:10] that place of humility listen saints we
[1:16:12] can't bring ourselves into that place
[1:16:15] there is a false humility that's in the
[1:16:17] land
[1:16:18] where people try to act humble
[1:16:21] but real humility is not an act
[1:16:24] it's a place of being
[1:16:27] you understand that
[1:16:29] it's a place that god brings each one of
[1:16:31] us to
[1:16:32] to where we know for for a fact listen
[1:16:36] that we are nothing
[1:16:39] you know who's the source of everything
[1:16:40] that you have
[1:16:42] you know who's the source behind any
[1:16:44] success you any true god given success
[1:16:46] you know he's the source and the reason
[1:16:48] behind it
[1:16:50] can we say praise the lord
[1:16:52] notice this now
[1:17:05] it means to be broken
[1:17:07] it means to be dejected
[1:17:09] it means to be beaten to pieces
[1:17:12] that's the hebrew definition of contrite
[1:17:16] so is is there something that god
[1:17:17] desires for you and i is that a state in
[1:17:20] place god desires for you and i to be in
[1:17:23] listen to this particular quotation here
[1:17:25] from time tested memorials
[1:17:29] brother branham says long years ago
[1:17:31] before they had the smelters they used
[1:17:33] to take the gold
[1:17:34] and and how they would know how it was
[1:17:37] right or not talking about the gold as
[1:17:39] they were working with it it says and
[1:17:41] all the sludge was out of it all the
[1:17:43] iron pyrite that's fools gold all the
[1:17:46] food was out of it it says beaters beat
[1:17:49] it and beat it and turned it and beat it
[1:17:51] and turned it until the beaters seen his
[1:17:53] reflection in the gold
[1:17:57] so as they were working with this gold
[1:17:58] there was a certain thing they were
[1:18:00] looking for
[1:18:02] and that enabled them to know that all
[1:18:03] of the dirt and whatever that was
[1:18:05] that was embedded deep within the gold
[1:18:08] was actually taken out of the gold
[1:18:11] the way our prophet said in one place
[1:18:14] he was saying how in order to draw
[1:18:17] that that that that dirt that had sunk
[1:18:20] way down into the the depths of the of
[1:18:22] this gold
[1:18:24] you know it had to be placed in in a
[1:18:27] very heated situation
[1:18:31] and the more heat that was applied
[1:18:34] it enabled the impurities that was
[1:18:37] embedded within the gold to begin to be
[1:18:39] broken loose at those deep stages
[1:18:43] and able to begin to travel its way up
[1:18:45] to the surface
[1:18:48] and when that impurity made it to the
[1:18:49] surface now a skimmer would come and
[1:18:51] skim those impurities off at the top
[1:18:55] but what made that impurity be able to
[1:18:57] come from that deep embedded place up to
[1:19:00] the top so it can be taken away
[1:19:03] it was the heat and the strength of the
[1:19:05] trial
[1:19:07] that god allowed to take place
[1:19:10] and we wonder why we've had hard days
[1:19:12] and hard lives and hard situations and
[1:19:15] in in in those times we get confused we
[1:19:18] don't know what's going on but get
[1:19:20] listen it's the mighty hand of god
[1:19:22] dealing with every one of us listen we
[1:19:25] are not all the same our trials are not
[1:19:27] all the same but god knows specifically
[1:19:30] what kind of trial you need to bring you
[1:19:32] the way you need to be
[1:19:37] but in those times the devils want the
[1:19:39] devil want us to get discouraged amen he
[1:19:42] wants us to get depressed he want us to
[1:19:44] feel like god is forsaking us
[1:19:49] what did our lord jesus say on the cross
[1:19:51] yes
[1:19:54] my god my god why is thou forsaking me
[1:19:58] but was he forsaken
[1:20:00] no sir not by far isn't that right and
[1:20:03] neither are we forsaken in the times of
[1:20:06] our hardest trials where we feel like
[1:20:08] you may be all alone
[1:20:10] you're not alone he's right there the
[1:20:11] whole time he's right there beside you
[1:20:16] he just allows you to go through that
[1:20:17] period of your life amen listen now
[1:20:19] they're strengthening you
[1:20:21] ain't meant to deliver you
[1:20:23] see that trial is intended to serve a
[1:20:25] certain purpose if you bring you out too
[1:20:27] soon you'll come out weaker than what
[1:20:29] you would if you went all the way
[1:20:30] through it so he don't allow nobody or
[1:20:33] nothing to bring you out of that place
[1:20:35] before the time
[1:20:42] can we say praise the lord
[1:20:46] notice how he says this now he says
[1:20:48] that's the way god does his church
[1:20:50] he gives you trial after trial test
[1:20:53] after test trial after trial test after
[1:20:56] test what is he doing he's bringing you
[1:20:58] into a contrite state
[1:21:01] but notice the contrite ones he says i
[1:21:03] dwell in high and holy places with that
[1:21:06] person
[1:21:08] well you think he ain't there he doesn't
[1:21:10] lifted you up to where he is
[1:21:13] and you don't even realize it
[1:21:16] you have god's attention
[1:21:18] amen he's actually tending to you he's
[1:21:20] actually elevating you
[1:21:22] the bible says humble yourselves under
[1:21:24] the mighty hand of god it says that
[1:21:26] he'll exalt you in due time but in this
[1:21:28] real place of being exalted you may not
[1:21:30] even feel like you're being exalted but
[1:21:32] in the sight of god now you've gotten to
[1:21:34] a place where you're really looking to
[1:21:36] him
[1:21:37] amen you're saying lord i need you lord
[1:21:39] i have mercy on me father i can't do
[1:21:42] nothing without you i mess my life up
[1:21:44] lord by making all these wrong decisions
[1:21:46] but i'm yielding to you now i'm calling
[1:21:48] out to you lord
[1:21:49] and that's the place god needs for us to
[1:21:51] be in saints
[1:21:53] that's a place of power
[1:21:55] now you're with the king amen you're
[1:21:57] with the mighty god
[1:22:00] but you don't feel like it
[1:22:04] you understand it ain't about feeling
[1:22:09] give me let me give you an example
[1:22:12] when peter was walking on that water
[1:22:16] he walked all the way over to where
[1:22:17] jesus was
[1:22:23] so he was about this far from jesus
[1:22:26] right
[1:22:27] right he over there standing in the face
[1:22:29] of god
[1:22:31] now this this is how powerful satan is
[1:22:33] with his trickery in our minds
[1:22:36] he was this close to god walked on water
[1:22:40] mind you
[1:22:42] he walked on water to get to where jesus
[1:22:44] was now he in front of jesus
[1:22:46] and the devil was able to come in his
[1:22:48] mind while he was in the face looking
[1:22:50] jesus in the eye
[1:22:52] and the devil was made able to make him
[1:22:54] get his mind on his problem more than
[1:22:56] the one that was standing before him
[1:22:58] and the bible says while he's in front
[1:23:00] of jesus all of a sudden he began to
[1:23:02] realize the waves was all rough
[1:23:05] and he took his eyes off of christ i'm
[1:23:06] gonna look at the water the water he was
[1:23:08] just walking on he was operating in the
[1:23:11] supernatural
[1:23:12] and the devil made him forget about what
[1:23:14] was really taking place
[1:23:16] yes
[1:23:18] isn't that something how many realize
[1:23:19] that happens to us
[1:23:21] yes you could be in the very presence of
[1:23:23] god and satan come through your trial
[1:23:25] and try to make you forget about
[1:23:26] everything that's actually that is
[1:23:28] actually taking place right at that time
[1:23:30] and when peter's focus shifted
[1:23:33] his condition changed he was able to
[1:23:35] sink
[1:23:37] in the presence of god
[1:23:39] all right but what was that due to a
[1:23:41] mental restriction
[1:23:44] yes
[1:23:45] do you realize that
[1:23:47] so we ain't no match for the devil
[1:23:49] that's right brother right it's like
[1:23:50] brother jesse what's talking about he
[1:23:52] can come in in such a way in our minds
[1:23:54] and bring thoughts in such a combination
[1:23:57] make you forget who you are right
[1:23:59] huh
[1:24:00] we're going to get into something here i
[1:24:02] ain't going to be much longer we're
[1:24:02] going to get into something but he was
[1:24:04] so close to jesus until even though he
[1:24:06] began to doubt god
[1:24:09] in the face of god
[1:24:15] saints we ain't always on our p's and
[1:24:16] cues aren't right
[1:24:18] i'ma tell you it's things that god do
[1:24:20] for us solely by his grace it ain't
[1:24:23] because we believe him like we should we
[1:24:25] trying to believe but we fall to many
[1:24:27] times isn't that right and god will come
[1:24:29] and do for us what we stand in need of
[1:24:31] anyway just to show us i was there for
[1:24:33] you ain't no reason for you to doubt me
[1:24:36] [Applause]
[1:24:38] but he was so close to jesus saints
[1:24:39] until when he began to sing all jesus
[1:24:42] had to do was reach down and grab his
[1:24:43] hand
[1:24:46] and pull him back up
[1:24:55] he says
[1:24:56] here
[1:24:58] he says that's the way god does his
[1:25:00] church he gives you trial after trial
[1:25:02] test after test trial after trial test
[1:25:04] after test until the life of christ is
[1:25:06] reflected in your life
[1:25:08] until you become peaceful
[1:25:11] sober meek
[1:25:13] gentle humble ready submissive willing
[1:25:17] turn your head to the things of the
[1:25:18] world and looking straight to calvary to
[1:25:21] the one who's doing the beating
[1:25:27] isn't that something saints
[1:25:29] so christ allows us to be subject like
[1:25:31] he did in hebrews 11 to all types of
[1:25:34] hard situations
[1:25:36] but what is he doing he's actually
[1:25:38] getting all of the unbelief purging it
[1:25:40] out of our lives
[1:25:42] bringing us into a place of soul
[1:25:44] dependency upon him
[1:25:46] so that now he can fully have his way
[1:25:48] and desire that he wants to in the way
[1:25:49] that he wants to we enable god to begin
[1:25:52] to flow through us at that time
[1:25:55] now the dead is raised the the sick is
[1:25:58] healed just all sorts of miracles and
[1:26:01] things are able to take place because
[1:26:02] he's present in the way that he desires
[1:26:04] to be
[1:26:05] he's able to have his way
[1:26:09] so now
[1:26:11] god's desire is not just to make us
[1:26:14] frustrated and have hard times
[1:26:17] right
[1:26:18] because he said that he dwells in high
[1:26:21] and holy places he says with them with
[1:26:24] him that is of a contrite and humble
[1:26:25] spirit he says to revive the spirit of
[1:26:29] the humble
[1:26:38] this is really something here now
[1:26:39] because as i said the devil
[1:26:42] he wants you to focus in on your problem
[1:26:44] of what's not going right right and he
[1:26:47] wants you to become kind of consumed he
[1:26:49] wants your the channel of your thoughts
[1:26:51] to become locked into a negative aspect
[1:26:53] of things
[1:26:55] because there is a picture he wanted
[1:26:56] pain in our minds right right
[1:26:58] right but the reason why we go through
[1:27:00] these things he says to revive
[1:27:04] revive the spirit of the contrite ones
[1:27:06] to revive the spirit of the humble what
[1:27:08] does that word revive mean saints and
[1:27:10] this is according to webster's
[1:27:11] dictionary
[1:27:13] right after god has allowed us to be
[1:27:15] broken down
[1:27:18] right
[1:27:21] once we get to that place that he wants
[1:27:22] us to be too that he desires for us to
[1:27:24] come into that that condition that frame
[1:27:26] of mind when you know you're nothing you
[1:27:28] know you need him for everything right
[1:27:31] the purpose of him doing that now he's
[1:27:33] he's going to revive you now you in the
[1:27:35] place you need to be now he's going to
[1:27:37] revive you what does that word mean the
[1:27:39] word revive means to return to
[1:27:41] consciousness or life
[1:27:44] sometimes as you're going through things
[1:27:46] you forget who you are right
[1:27:48] you enter into a spiritual amnesia
[1:27:51] you forget you are a son and daughter of
[1:27:53] god
[1:27:55] the devil try to make you feel otherwise
[1:27:58] am i a child of god maybe i might not be
[1:28:00] a child of god
[1:28:02] amen
[1:28:03] but god understands all those troubles
[1:28:05] and ways of thinking that kind of cross
[1:28:07] our paths at times because that's what
[1:28:08] the enemy wants right but god comes to
[1:28:11] revive the spirit of the contrite
[1:28:13] that word revive means to return to
[1:28:15] consciousness or life listen it means to
[1:28:18] become active or flourishing again
[1:28:22] amen it's a place that you would once
[1:28:24] had amen but then god allowed you to be
[1:28:26] taken down from that place so that he
[1:28:28] can work with you a little bit to bring
[1:28:30] you into true humility and now that
[1:28:32] you're brought into that place of true
[1:28:33] humility where he knows in your soul you
[1:28:36] know that he's the king he's the master
[1:28:38] he's in control of everything right then
[1:28:41] from that place he's able now to exalt
[1:28:43] you or to revive you
[1:28:45] what is he doing he said he's bringing
[1:28:47] you back a man from an inactive place to
[1:28:51] flourish again amen it means to restore
[1:28:54] from a depressed inactive or unused
[1:28:57] state
[1:29:03] the plan of god is so perfect
[1:29:06] amen
[1:29:07] because god knows that some of the
[1:29:09] things we go through saints we get
[1:29:11] depressed sometimes
[1:29:13] amen sometimes we feel all alone
[1:29:16] isn't that right
[1:29:17] but he's come here to help him unless
[1:29:19] it's within it it's within his mind his
[1:29:21] desire to bring us down to that lowly
[1:29:24] place to where we know that we're
[1:29:26] nothing but also to revive us up listen
[1:29:29] in a spiritual way
[1:29:32] in line with his spirit and his
[1:29:34] character
[1:29:35] into a place now watch he says to revive
[1:29:39] i love this he says to restore from a
[1:29:42] depressed inactive or unused state to
[1:29:45] renew in the mind or memory
[1:29:49] the bible says be transformed by the
[1:29:51] renewing of your mind
[1:29:53] isn't that right god brings his word in
[1:29:55] now he's allowed he allows his word to
[1:29:56] be preached to you and he quickens that
[1:29:58] word gives you an understanding of that
[1:30:00] word amen to build you back up again
[1:30:03] amen he's building you back up into now
[1:30:06] oh my
[1:30:08] oh my
[1:30:11] i'm gonna let this speak to you a little
[1:30:13] bit here
[1:30:15] amen
[1:30:17] oh my
[1:30:20] like this he says in the message of
[1:30:21] perfect strength perfect weakness he
[1:30:23] says and that's the way god wants us
[1:30:25] realize that we are totally insufficient
[1:30:28] he says then god takes that person and
[1:30:30] begins to mow his self into that person
[1:30:33] he says make his hands do what god would
[1:30:35] have his hands to do make his lips speak
[1:30:38] what god's lips would speak because
[1:30:40] they're not his their gods he said he
[1:30:42] begins to build a character begins to
[1:30:45] take this weakness and to make his own
[1:30:48] self
[1:30:49] amen now it's no more who you thought
[1:30:51] you should be
[1:30:52] yes you understand what i'm saying in
[1:30:54] this world that we live in people have
[1:30:56] thoughts of who they should be and they
[1:30:58] try to mold themselves into what they
[1:31:01] think they should be amen
[1:31:05] and they lose total thought total tract
[1:31:08] total mindfulness of what god wants them
[1:31:10] to be amen
[1:31:12] amen so what does god have to do he has
[1:31:14] to come into that life when it's his
[1:31:16] life his child he ain't gonna let you go
[1:31:18] on like that
[1:31:19] god's gonna come into your life and he's
[1:31:20] gonna reintroduce himself to you amen
[1:31:23] and he's gonna take his word and he's
[1:31:24] gonna begin to minister to you amen and
[1:31:27] he's gonna begin to show you who you
[1:31:29] really are at him
[1:31:31] and bring you to a place where you
[1:31:32] desire to be like that and not like you
[1:31:35] used to be you begin to realize what you
[1:31:37] used to be was a lie that the devil told
[1:31:40] to you that the world made you think
[1:31:42] amen but now god brings you under his
[1:31:45] under his atmosphere amen into his world
[1:31:48] and he begins to minister to you and he
[1:31:51] begins to show you who you should be and
[1:31:53] what his mind was for you all the time
[1:31:55] and because you are his child guess what
[1:31:57] you begin to do you begin to agree
[1:32:04] i wasn't brought up in the church
[1:32:06] i was brought up in the streets
[1:32:08] i came up in a drug house
[1:32:10] hey man my mom was a drug addict you
[1:32:12] understand what i'm saying i grew up
[1:32:14] with drug addicts running all through my
[1:32:15] house when i'm waking up in the middle
[1:32:17] of the night trying to go to the
[1:32:18] bathroom amen why did god do that
[1:32:21] because i needed that kind of a
[1:32:22] lifestyle to mow me into the person that
[1:32:25] he desired for me to be
[1:32:26] amen my life hasn't been easy but i'm
[1:32:28] telling you right now by revelation
[1:32:30] every bit of it was worth it i know it
[1:32:33] was by the grace of god i know it was
[1:32:34] about the purpose of god now
[1:32:37] the devil can't come and mess with my
[1:32:38] mind no more listen saints i wasn't even
[1:32:41] allowed to be raised by my daddy
[1:32:45] you understand what i'm saying you want
[1:32:46] to know why i wasn't able to be raised
[1:32:48] by my daddy because god knew that i was
[1:32:50] raised by my daddy it would have been
[1:32:52] things introduced into my life that
[1:32:53] would have been harmful to my walk with
[1:32:55] him
[1:32:56] you understand what i'm saying that's
[1:32:58] why god had to take john the baptist out
[1:32:59] into the wilderness at a young age so he
[1:33:02] wouldn't be under the influences of
[1:33:03] those that would have tried to influence
[1:33:05] his life in a certain way so that god
[1:33:08] can use him in a particular fashion once
[1:33:10] he became of age
[1:33:12] many times we try to fight sometimes and
[1:33:14] keep people in our lives
[1:33:16] and those are the very things god is
[1:33:18] trying to get away from your life
[1:33:20] because there is a harmful effect
[1:33:22] that person or that situation or that
[1:33:24] environment would have on you that god
[1:33:26] is trying to deliver you from amen but
[1:33:28] we don't understand that sometimes and
[1:33:30] we get sharper
[1:33:32] why did this person begin to act like
[1:33:34] that why did they begin to treat me like
[1:33:35] that why did they leave my life or this
[1:33:38] that and the other not understanding is
[1:33:39] a great plan
[1:33:41] that god has in store for you and he's
[1:33:44] working things according to his will
[1:33:47] lot had to separate from abraham
[1:33:51] that was abraham's family
[1:33:54] huh
[1:33:55] but it wasn't until light was separated
[1:33:57] from abraham that god came down and
[1:33:59] began to speak to abraham again to
[1:34:01] confirm the promise that he made to
[1:34:02] abraham and he was going to be the
[1:34:04] father of many nations but while lot was
[1:34:06] there god couldn't deal with abraham
[1:34:08] like he wanted to
[1:34:12] so god had to allow abraham's father to
[1:34:14] pass off the scene
[1:34:15] he allowed his family to separate from
[1:34:17] him why because god was getting them
[1:34:19] close to himself
[1:34:21] he was bringing abraham up into a high
[1:34:23] and lofty place
[1:34:28] so we can he can mold himself into
[1:34:30] abraham amen and make abraham to be the
[1:34:32] example that he is to you and i today
[1:34:35] but why was that how was that is because
[1:34:37] of the working of god in a man's life
[1:34:39] that humbled himself to god gave up
[1:34:42] everything
[1:34:43] walked away from family and
[1:34:45] fortune
[1:34:47] for the sake of being joined to god
[1:34:50] but god has so much more in store for
[1:34:52] him and guess what he has yet more
[1:34:53] rewards coming
[1:34:55] isn't that right saints
[1:34:57] there's a reward that we got coming to
[1:34:58] us amen all wind going through all this
[1:35:01] in vain
[1:35:02] amen it ain't about what rewards you
[1:35:03] receive here in this life but yet god
[1:35:05] will reward you in this life
[1:35:07] how many realize that
[1:35:09] we were talking about it a little bit
[1:35:11] yesterday god can make any one of us
[1:35:12] millionaires if you want to
[1:35:14] if you want to make me a millionaire i
[1:35:15] ain't going to i ain't going to not
[1:35:16] receive it
[1:35:18] i'll say thank you lord
[1:35:21] amen but when he's really worked with
[1:35:23] you in your life even when he when he
[1:35:25] gives you abundance there's a certain
[1:35:27] way you'll deal with it
[1:35:29] you understand what i'm saying he won't
[1:35:30] give us nothing that'll be harmful to us
[1:35:32] so once once we're molded into a
[1:35:35] particular place where god knows we can
[1:35:36] handle it then he'll give it to us but
[1:35:39] until then he'll hold it back why it'll
[1:35:41] be damaging to us at too early of a
[1:35:43] stage
[1:35:44] just like a child you're not going to
[1:35:45] give children certain things before the
[1:35:47] time
[1:35:48] when you feel that you when you feel
[1:35:49] they're not they're not capable of being
[1:35:50] able to handle it you hold it back
[1:35:53] hey man but yet you you say once you
[1:35:55] once i see you got a better hold on
[1:35:56] things and a better understanding of
[1:35:58] things and you're a little more
[1:35:59] responsible then i'll release it to you
[1:36:02] because i'm going to realize that's how
[1:36:03] god is doing us
[1:36:05] there might be things you want right now
[1:36:06] but god knows you can't handle it right
[1:36:08] now amen but hold on he he might still
[1:36:11] have that in store for you hey man just
[1:36:13] be patient allow him to work his work in
[1:36:14] your life
[1:36:15] amen he knows what he's doing
[1:36:18] can we say praise the lord sayings
[1:36:20] as i close on this point amen i love
[1:36:24] this
[1:36:25] amen
[1:36:26] oh my
[1:36:30] let's let's let me wrap it up in
[1:36:33] in uh
[1:36:34] corinthians that was what first
[1:36:35] corinthians chapter 2 corinthians
[1:36:38] chapter 12 let's wrap it up right here
[1:36:40] with paul
[1:36:43] everybody's all right
[1:36:46] amen let's wrap this up with paul right
[1:36:48] here so we see how careful paul had
[1:36:50] become in his life not to bring any
[1:36:52] attention to himself he wanted all
[1:36:54] attention to be placed on god
[1:36:57] and that's that place of when you're in
[1:36:58] that place of power that true place of
[1:37:00] humility where you're clothed with
[1:37:01] humility that's all you desires for all
[1:37:03] attention to be placed on god you're not
[1:37:06] trying to shine in no kind of a way
[1:37:08] you're not trying to step in god's way
[1:37:11] so people can see you see me hey
[1:37:13] i'm the one
[1:37:15] i notice that many times in churches you
[1:37:17] know
[1:37:18] that there are people that are doing
[1:37:19] things for the church and whatever and
[1:37:21] sometimes they get a little the devil
[1:37:22] will come to them sometimes and minister
[1:37:24] to them and make them feel a little down
[1:37:26] because they're not being recognized for
[1:37:28] all they're doing in the church
[1:37:30] you understand how many realize god will
[1:37:32] let you sit in that condition
[1:37:34] amen because he wants you to get to a
[1:37:36] place to where you're doing it for him
[1:37:37] and not for your own glory
[1:37:40] huh many times god will let you do
[1:37:41] things and not be recognized wouldn't be
[1:37:43] mentioned at all
[1:37:45] but yet he see it
[1:37:47] amen and what's the real satisfaction is
[1:37:49] that you're doing the will of god
[1:37:51] not that you're getting glory from any
[1:37:52] man being recognized for anything
[1:37:55] you're just able to move right on happy
[1:37:57] as can be because you know that you're
[1:37:59] pleasing your lord
[1:38:01] oh my
[1:38:02] so paul he was in that place now
[1:38:05] that's why his ministry was so powerful
[1:38:07] that's why god came to him and told him
[1:38:09] told our prophet
[1:38:11] rather our prophet he said i preached
[1:38:13] the same thing paul preached to paul's
[1:38:14] group make it he said yes they did he
[1:38:16] said well i preached the same thing paul
[1:38:18] preaching all the saints beyond the
[1:38:20] curtain of time when he said that he
[1:38:22] said they all said that's what we're
[1:38:24] resting on
[1:38:26] huh
[1:38:27] why paul paul was in such a place with
[1:38:29] god he says now if anybody else he says
[1:38:31] if we or anybody else come and preach
[1:38:33] any other gospel to you and what we've
[1:38:34] already preached let them be a curse
[1:38:36] even if an angel come down
[1:38:39] why because he knew he it was the spirit
[1:38:41] of god that was delivering that word
[1:38:43] through his mouth it wasn't his own word
[1:38:45] that's why he put himself in it if we
[1:38:47] come back and try to say anything
[1:38:48] different we already said let us be a
[1:38:51] curse
[1:38:54] but yet at the same time he was in this
[1:38:56] place
[1:38:57] which enabled him to be able to speak in
[1:38:59] the way that he did because it was god
[1:39:01] now just having his way
[1:39:03] i'm coming down to verse 7.
[1:39:07] well i'm sorry i want to go back to
[1:39:08] verse 6.
[1:39:12] verse 5
[1:39:15] of such a one will i glory yet of myself
[1:39:17] i will not glory
[1:39:19] but in mine infirmities it's my
[1:39:21] weaknesses that i'm a glory and why this
[1:39:23] is why
[1:39:25] he says for though i would i would
[1:39:26] desire the glory i shall not be a fool
[1:39:29] he says for i will say the truth but now
[1:39:32] i forbid
[1:39:33] lest any man should think of me above
[1:39:35] that which he seeth me to be and that he
[1:39:37] heareth of me
[1:39:39] so paul had not wanted to be a fool to
[1:39:41] try to get attention to himself he said
[1:39:43] he was forbearing that's why he spoke as
[1:39:45] though it was another person that
[1:39:46] visited these places and not himself
[1:39:49] right verse 7 says unless i should be
[1:39:51] exalted notice this part now
[1:39:55] now this is god's intervention in paul's
[1:39:57] life
[1:39:59] he says unless i should be exalted above
[1:40:01] measure through the abundance of
[1:40:02] revelations
[1:40:05] now i want you to just kind of hone in
[1:40:07] on these saints
[1:40:08] paul had the holy ghost
[1:40:11] he was filled with the holy ghost can we
[1:40:13] say amen to that amen
[1:40:18] but even with the holy ghost
[1:40:22] god still had to allow something to be
[1:40:24] in paul's life to keep him from being
[1:40:26] exalted within himself
[1:40:30] even with the power of the holy ghost
[1:40:32] residing in his life
[1:40:36] unless i should be exalted above measure
[1:40:38] through the abundance and revelation
[1:40:40] there was given
[1:40:42] isn't that something
[1:40:44] he says there was given to me a thorn in
[1:40:46] the flesh who gave it
[1:40:49] god gave it
[1:40:52] god allowed the devil
[1:40:54] to bring an affliction into his
[1:40:56] prophet's life
[1:40:58] even though he was full of the holy
[1:40:59] ghost
[1:41:00] just to keep paul humble and grounded
[1:41:05] because of the tight ministry that he
[1:41:06] was ordained to have
[1:41:09] god allowed the devil listen to what he
[1:41:11] said out of his own mouth there was
[1:41:13] given to me a thorn in the flesh he says
[1:41:15] the messenger of satan to buffet me he
[1:41:18] said as he said lest i should be exalted
[1:41:21] above measure he says for this thing
[1:41:23] because he didn't understand it
[1:41:26] he saw the effects of it but he didn't
[1:41:28] understand it so because he didn't
[1:41:30] understand it he didn't know there it
[1:41:31] was a reason for it being there
[1:41:33] isn't that something
[1:41:35] god dealt with him in such a way man yet
[1:41:37] paul was experiencing this affliction
[1:41:39] this thing that god allowed the devil to
[1:41:41] bring into his life and paul didn't
[1:41:43] understand it so he wanted to be free
[1:41:45] from it because of what it did to him
[1:41:47] right
[1:41:48] he says and for this thing he says i
[1:41:51] besought the lord thrice that it might
[1:41:53] depart from me and he said unto me so
[1:41:56] god didn't come to him with the answer
[1:41:58] that he wanted
[1:41:59] notice what god did and he said unto me
[1:42:01] my grace is sufficient for thee
[1:42:04] for my strength notice is made perfect
[1:42:11] we see that
[1:42:13] my strength is made what
[1:42:17] in what
[1:42:22] so the place of power is a power it's a
[1:42:24] place where god's strength is made
[1:42:26] perfect
[1:42:28] but that place of perfection that place
[1:42:30] of power it lies within the weakest
[1:42:33] moments that we have
[1:42:35] it lies within those places that we
[1:42:37] can't help ourselves and god allows
[1:42:39] things to exist in our lives there are
[1:42:42] things that might be in your life right
[1:42:44] now
[1:42:44] that you might desire to be rid of
[1:42:48] but you might not know god might be
[1:42:50] allowing that one thing to be there to
[1:42:52] keep your attention on him
[1:42:55] to keep you on your knees
[1:42:58] you understand what i'm saying now
[1:42:59] notice how i'm i'm in on this point now
[1:43:03] right
[1:43:04] he says for this thing i besought the
[1:43:06] lord thrice that it might depart from me
[1:43:08] and he said unto me my grace is
[1:43:09] sufficient for thee for my strength is
[1:43:11] made perfect in weakness most gladly
[1:43:13] therefore or will i rather glory in my
[1:43:16] infirmities that the power of christ
[1:43:18] might do what
[1:43:20] he says rest upon me
[1:43:23] so while he was going through these
[1:43:24] challenges while he was experiencing
[1:43:26] these difficulties in his own body
[1:43:29] god said no that's my grace and it's
[1:43:32] sufficient
[1:43:33] right i'm not taking it away paul i'm
[1:43:35] gonna let it stay there
[1:43:37] and then paul came to understand that
[1:43:39] god did this for my good
[1:43:41] he did this to keep me humble to keep me
[1:43:43] grounded
[1:43:44] now i just kind of want to mention to
[1:43:45] you here with the prophet how the
[1:43:47] prophet elaborated on this point
[1:43:50] he says there was probably 10 or 15 men
[1:43:52] with him
[1:43:53] did any of those men see that light
[1:43:55] talking about when christ came and
[1:43:57] knocked paul down off of the horse right
[1:44:00] did any man with him see that light no
[1:44:02] sir paul saw it it wasn't designated for
[1:44:05] them men to see it so some people can
[1:44:08] see things where others don't see so
[1:44:10] paul was he says paul saw that light in
[1:44:13] so much that it even blinded him the
[1:44:15] bible says that he was blinded like
[1:44:17] scales was over his eyes
[1:44:18] right he couldn't see for several days
[1:44:22] it was such a reality to him he says and
[1:44:24] he couldn't see for several days he says
[1:44:26] later on
[1:44:28] when he wrote letters his eyes bothered
[1:44:31] him so bad from that until he wrote with
[1:44:34] great big letters
[1:44:36] so the issue paul was having was with
[1:44:38] his eyes
[1:44:43] he says he says seeing that i have
[1:44:45] written to you with large letters he
[1:44:47] couldn't hardly see
[1:44:48] he was in jail and he asked the lord to
[1:44:50] heal him of it and he consoled him three
[1:44:53] times but what did the lord say my grace
[1:44:55] is sufficient paul he says paul said
[1:44:58] then will i glory in my infirmities
[1:45:00] because i said except i would be exalted
[1:45:02] above
[1:45:03] above the abundance of revelation that
[1:45:05] was given to me a messenger of the devil
[1:45:07] a thorn in the flesh to buffet me
[1:45:10] he says he get better for a while and
[1:45:12] then away they go again talking about
[1:45:15] his sight going in and out in and out he
[1:45:18] says buffett means blow after blow like
[1:45:21] the ship on the sea you know the waves
[1:45:23] buffeted he says see blow after blow and
[1:45:25] he would he'd get better and then have
[1:45:28] and then have it again and he'd get
[1:45:29] better and then have it again he said
[1:45:31] lord what's the matter you don't you
[1:45:33] don't take this thing away from me he
[1:45:35] says my grace is sufficient paul just
[1:45:38] keep on
[1:45:39] he says now if i was just perfect and
[1:45:42] everything perfect said then when i when
[1:45:44] i went along i'd get puffed up and say
[1:45:47] you see nothing wrong with me lord takes
[1:45:49] care of me brother hallelujah he says
[1:45:51] then you're getting self-righteous
[1:45:53] he says god has to give you a little
[1:45:55] something and i'm in on this point
[1:45:57] saints god has to give you a little
[1:45:59] something once in a while to kind of
[1:46:01] meeting you up a little so he says you
[1:46:03] know he says that's right kind of make
[1:46:05] you realize that he's the boss he says
[1:46:08] oh isn't he wonderful yes sir just glory
[1:46:10] that's what he had to do to
[1:46:11] nebuchadnezzar
[1:46:13] once he drove nebuchadnezzar out made
[1:46:15] him live like an animal he restored
[1:46:17] nebuchadnezzar but before he restored
[1:46:19] nebuchadnezzar nebuchadnezzar came to a
[1:46:21] confession with his own mouth
[1:46:24] and he realized he was nothing
[1:46:26] and he gave glory to god and he knew
[1:46:28] that god was the one that put me in up
[1:46:31] and put men down he says that no one can
[1:46:33] stay his power
[1:46:34] amen so god's purpose was achieved in
[1:46:37] nebuchadnezzar's life he brought him
[1:46:39] back to
[1:46:40] out of his amnesia
[1:46:42] hey man brought him back to his right
[1:46:44] frame of mind and once he came back to
[1:46:46] his right frame of mind god put him back
[1:46:48] in position again
[1:46:49] isn't that right but now he was better
[1:46:51] he was able better to reign in a mindset
[1:46:54] that he should have had in the beginning
[1:46:57] but because he did what he did god just
[1:46:59] had to bring him back again to a place
[1:47:01] to where he say now okay now go back you
[1:47:02] can go back now
[1:47:04] i'm gonna realize god to do that to us
[1:47:06] he'll take us bring us down work with us
[1:47:09] bring us to the place we need to be in
[1:47:11] and then he'll restore us right back
[1:47:13] again
[1:47:14] but now we're in a better position now
[1:47:16] we're more humble now we're closed with
[1:47:18] humility
[1:47:20] and we will never rise above that again
[1:47:22] once god gets through with us
[1:47:24] isn't that right
[1:47:26] so let's thank god saints for this place
[1:47:28] of power that he's bringing all of us
[1:47:30] into let's give him glory for that amen
[1:47:41] praise the lord
[1:47:43] and let us all stand together as we go
[1:47:44] before him in prayer
[1:47:53] as we bow our heads together
[1:47:56] understanding saints that the lord has
[1:47:58] made it in a way the way he says no
[1:48:00] flesh shall be able to glory in his
[1:48:02] sight
[1:48:04] amen so let's give him praise always in
[1:48:07] our hearts no matter what it is we're
[1:48:08] going through
[1:48:10] amen understanding that everything is
[1:48:12] under his control
[1:48:14] there's nothing out of his control but
[1:48:16] is right in his control and he's
[1:48:17] permitting every bit of it
[1:48:19] but it's serving a specific purpose to
[1:48:21] bring us into this real place of power
[1:48:24] to where he has full control
