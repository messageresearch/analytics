========================================

it's refreshing to go back over this and just uh just really astounding to think about how many times God anointed our Prophet to speak with thus sayeth the Lord reminds us of Jeremiah Isaiah Ezekiel uh so many prophets of God who spoke with the authority of thus saith the Lord hallelujah and I got at least one more uh sermon here on uh the spirit of burning by God's grace of course you know I can't end that Series without preaching on the day of Pentecost burning everybody understand that by God's grace I could I couldn't end the series without that that's the greatest burning we can have on this side how many how many can say Amen to that the greatest burning you can ever have is where the Holy Ghost Burns in your soul Hallelujah everything it's nice that that burns out here here it's nice if it burns in here nice if it burns right here hallelujah but if it burns in your soul you're sealed unto the day of your Redemption praise God and you can never lose that seal Hallelujah so true James 5:10 we have thus sayith the Lord part two praise God this is what separates us we'd say from any denomination or any uh unorganized group or independent church we might say is that we have a prophet who spoke with thus sayith the Lord and it never failed critics have have come around for years for 20 some years let's see I came to the message 2021 so they come around for 24 years trying to tell me that they've yet to show me one hallelujah hallelujah they might not understand it uh but they do not he's never failed with a thus sayith the Lord hallelujah so we're very thankful for that by God's grace gives us a place to stand when the storms of life rage we know that we're standing on thus sayeth the Lord hallelujah because it agrees with the Bible James 5:10 let's read this if we can on three 1 2 3 take take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering Affliction and of patience praise God let's also go to Amos 37 and8 Amos 37 and8 I think I said that right praise God Amos 37 and 8 praise God so these are scriptures we should be familiar with as Bible Believers and those that follow brother Ram's Ministry uh the more I go over them the more uh it edifies my soul uh the more I'm strengthened and encouraged uh believing the word of God the present truth as Peter said be always established in the present truth praise God and we can see all down through the Bible there was always a time where there was a prophet who brought the present truth hallelujah now with brother Braham is different no one's going to add or take away from the Bible so everything he says with us say the lord it's going to agree with the Bible Hallelujah because in the days of you know Moses and Joshua and Abraham Isaac Jacob you know there was no written scripture but now we have the written scripture praise God so we understand that let's read seven and eight 1 2 3 surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets the lion hath roared who will not fear the lord God ha spoken who can but prophesy so we see from this text when a prophet prophesies with thus sayith the lord it's liken unto a lion that Roars and brother Ram said many times he was out in the jungles of uh Africa and he said there was noise at the night time they're hunting at night sometimes he said just let the lion roar one time he said everything shut up from from the zebras to the gazel he said even to the little Beatles everybody recognized the voice of the lion Hallelujah and of course we know it's Jesus Christ speaking through a prophet and the church said amen may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated I have some uh quotes here Casa by God's grace you know as we uh mentioned last time we're not following cunningly devised fables as Paul said Hallelujah and uh as brother Ram's own testimony says when God let him go beyond the curtain of time and he went uh into the paradise of God by a vision uh he said there was millions of people that were as converts and uh he said uh The Voice the the angel of the Lord told him you're going to have to be judged by what you preached and uh brother Bram said well is Paul going to be judged by what he preached yes and brother Bram said well then I preach exactly what Paul preached word by word and he said the millions and screamed out we are resting on that Hallelujah so you see you see the pattern every time God sends a man of God the people will have to receive it what the prophet said Hallelujah and then they're judged by the word that was preached for that generation Hallelujah and that's what we saw remember Paul said I'll present the Corinthians I'll present them as a Chase version to Christ and if he was the first church age messenger brother BR is the seventh Church age messenger each Church age messenger the seven angels will present their group under Christ as a Chase virgin Hallelujah so we can see it plainly in the scripture uh by the grace of God the Bible always said the prophets were gathered with their people hallelujah and then so we see uh Paul's people will be gathered with him brother Rams will be gathered with him Hallelujah so we know will be gathered with brother brandom there in heaven by God's grace Hallelujah now remember brother Bram said I'm just rehearsing this as a review uh we have thus sayith the Lord on God dealing with this church you know brother man was again talking about so much education is emphasized he said but God God never dealt with Israel till she come to her Homeland hear me thus sayith the Lord God will not deal with his church till she comes back to the Homeland the message of the Hour come back to the original praise God hallelujah and so we can see some of these names in here that he names you know and we can see uh even just this week there was more news about one of the denominations my wife sent me a link about they went even further away and every year in the summertime there's a Southern Baptist convention every year they fall further and further away from the truth every every summer it's it's just like clockwork and so denominations are like that because they limit God they say they write up their Creed if this was their Creed you know they would say well we'll take this really they're saying we'll take this above this as what they're saying for like uh Baptist you know they'll deny tongues or they'll deny Miracles or something or they they'll say now women can preach so they're really taking this they're exalting this Creed above the word of God but not a true Christian a true Christian places this above everything else Hallelujah and that's what God did uh by G sending us brother brandham to restore all things the Bible says as we'll look at here in just a moment now I don't know if I've gone over this lately but I have this in my book from 2021 um there's at least I think six six scriptures that brother Brandon's Ministry fulfilled and it's acts 32021 uh Matthew 1711 and 12 Malachi 45 and 6 Revelation 10 7-1 Amos 37 and Luke 17:30 now if you put all these together it was just revealed to me as I was studying one time this is what I wrote based upon the inspiration from these scriptures so nobody told me this this is just what the Lord revealed to me as I was studying very simple all these verses say Jesus will remain in heaven and not physically return to the Earth until all things including Bible doctrines and the hearts of Believers are restored to their original Apostolic conditions by the preaching of a prophet Anointed with the spirit of Elijah Hallelujah amen nobody shared that with me I mean I you can hear you can see those different parts in these scriptures but that's what was revealed to me praise God now acts 3:21 says um Jesus will remain in Heaven until the times of restitution or restoration of all things so that's where we get that part Matthew 17:11 Jesus said Elias shall surely come and restore all things right and that's not referring to Elijah that goes to the Jews they're not going to restore uh the the the law of Moses they're trying to bring they're trying to get the 144,000 to accept Jesus Hallelujah so it has to be a a a prophit to the Gentiles Hallelujah and then of course Malachi 45 and 6 we need the spirit of Elijah to turn the hearts back to the fathers so it's the it's the uh the children the Believers at the end time getting their hearts turned back to the apostolic faith of the Bible authors like Paul James Peter John so forth Revelation 10 1-7 brother Ram is that seventh angel in Revelation 10:7 he finishes the mystery of God as God had declared to his servants the prophets Hallelujah and then uh we saw this uh God will do nothing except he restore he he he reveals Secrets uh by the prophet and brother Ram did that God showed brother Ram the the secrets behind 12 New Testament Mysteries that was my that's what my book was about six of them have thus sayith the Lord Brother R revealed the Seven Seals and there's over 38 differences between his Revelation and Clarence Larin and UAH Smith and all these other uh Charles T Russell all these other preachers of their day and then Luke 17:30 is uh the son of man Ministry in the days of the son of man uh so brother Ram was a son of man he was a prophet he wasn't the son of man Jesus is the son of man brother Ram was a son of man Hallelujah but the son of man had to be revealed at the end time according to Luke 17:30 and so that's what happened uh God sent brother R's Ministry to restore the apostolic faith at the end time Hallelujah so this is what I'm believing with all my heart because of what uh God Vindicated in brother bram's Ministry with thus sayith the Lord hallelujah and I just thought if he was right on all these thus the Lords we have on Doctrine then he's right on everything else because God doesn't mess God doesn't mix up sometimes Hallelujah God sends him with thus sayith the Lord and he's right every time now these are the ones we reviewed I just Ed emojis there to show the check marks that we've uh that we got through last time by God's grace and that's what I was saying if he was right on all these like just a simple thing like marriage and divorce and hair length if he was right on that well then he's got to be right on the others praise God but because again God doesn't miss Hallelujah God doesn't miss and of course brother Rah lived a Godly life nobody can put a finger on his life Hallelujah he lived a Godly life you know you got you got the author of how many you heard of God's generals before you got the author of God's generals he wrote that that gentleman and I think might have had some help he wrote all those articles about preachers down through the years and you know his uh conclusion about brother random is that he had one of the greatest gifts ever but then he got off on his Doctrine at the end what a mistake he never really honestly looked at the scripture praise God especially regarding serpent seed he never looked at that that's one of the ones he said he got off on oh so so so you're telling me now that that an apple caused all this trouble that we have here an apple caused it no it was adultery that caused it and that's still what's causing the trouble Hallelujah is all adultery sexual immorality and everything around the world oh my and today we or tonight Lord willing we'll look at just a few more of these and we'll see how far we can get brother R gave us thus sayith the Lord on the baptism of the Holy Ghost now most churches believe when someone comes up for prayer and they say I want to be a Christian let's pray and for example they might pray a sinner's prayer or you hear preachers they'll say they'll say a quick uh 30 second prayer at the end of a service and they'll say if you said that like Joel if you said that you're born again in the kingdom of God that's a lie that's a lie they're say they're saying one simple prayer no emotion just repeating repeat after me repeat after me and they say they're baptized with the Holy Ghost that's a lie that's a false Doctrine any true church will teach there's three works of Grace you got to get saved Sanctified and then filled with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah any honest person any real honest believer will admit that Hallelujah and so uh I just want the young I don't know if our young brothers and our young children knew that most churches if you go to them they'll say as soon as you're saved or baptized you're filled with the Holy Ghost that's a deception that's a false promise they're giving them a promise that isn't true that's lying to the people so we don't want to get caught up in that and of course it kind of ties in with classical preaching as we'll see brother that's what brother ram calls it classical preaching where they don't try to get you to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said that's of the devil thus sayith the lord it's true so uh here here's where brother says it uh brother B uh wrote a a book for five years he started in 1960 and released it right before his death uh in December 1965 but he he takes a subject of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I love what he says here it it must be according to the word not according to me and not according to you or me but it has to be thus sayith the Lord or we're falsely LED I love how brother Ram was so humble he said it's not from me any thus sayi the Lord can't be from me it's got to be from the word of God and we're not going to go through all these CU a lot of this is reviewed but in Acts 19 2 and6 the Ephesians get the Holy Ghost but they were already saved under Apollo they're already saved but remember uh aquill and Priscilla got to come by and instruct him in the way of God more perfectly see there was more truth available so I love it if you're hungry for truth God will send you the extra truth you need Hallelujah that's right see they had to live in the present truth when Paul brought it and then the Bible said then they got the Holy Ghost Hallelujah now Paul says in Ephesians 1:13 you're given the Seal of the Holy Ghost after you believe so see you got to believe first you got to get saved and you got to get your life cleaned out Sanctified and then you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost Ezekiel beautifully taught it in Ezekiel 36 he said a new heart new spirit my spirit Jesus said I'm the way the truth and the life Hallelujah Jesus said the wheat has three stages and I always forget these uh you got uh the Sprout you got the uh stem and then you got the seed uh and I always mix them up that's not the exact King James words but Jesus said there's three stages to the kingdom of God hallelujah oh it's all over the Bible Hallelujah I've got a chapter on it and acts 238 said the promises unto you now all these people were already Believers right they already followed Jesus these preachers have followed Jesus three and a half years but he said we are given the promise of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah get baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Peter walked on water I mean what more could there be there could be a lot more because he sunk in that water amen but when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're sealed you're marked you're branded to the day of your Redemption praise God acts 8 of course is down in Samaria the Bible said they they received uh Philip's preaching but then they uh but they prayed and then they sent Peter and John down to lay hands on them to receive the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost wasn't yet given and I love this brother Ram shows thus say the lord it's more than just saying a prayer sinner's prayer getting baptized you must go on to be born again hallelujah it's thus sayith the Lord Galatians 3 uh 13 and 14 say we are given the promise of the spirit through Abraham through Abraham's seed Hallelujah and then John 37 Jesus cried out at that last uh uh that last Feast that he was at he said let him that's thirsty come upon me come to me and I'll give you drink and out of your belly flow rivers of living water and the Bible said he spake of the spirit that they should receive after his body was glorified so he was prophesying of the day of Pentecost and the entire Gentile Church ages and brother R said Galatians 4 4-7 is the triumphal Capstone on the Capstone so here's the Capstone love which is God God is love and God when you were born again you're born again God's spirit draws in you it's the love of God that's the Capstone on your being on your soul so let's read that Galatians 4: 4-7 this is the Capstone and it kind of goes with a video I just put out today someone asked me about Matthew 24:24 uh why can the elect not be deceived and the answer is twofold because you're predestinated and because then during your lifetime you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's why you cannot be deceived that's why no preacher can deceive me or no woman can deceive me or you or anything like that nobody will deceive us because we've got the spirit of Truth we can't be deceived because we know the truth and the truth has made us free Hallelujah and church we would feel the chains of bondage come back on us if we were being deceived Hallelujah you'd feel those dark Spirits you'd feel the love of God leave you would feel the Holy Ghost grieved Hallelujah that's right Church Galatians 4 4-7 but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth a son made of a woman made under the law to redeem that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons remember uh Paul said in Romans the holy spirit is the spirit of adoption that goes into your hearts crying ABA father so that's what the baptism of the Holy Ghost is you're adopted into the family of God verse six and verse six is the the main verse the main phrase and because you are Sons let's all say because ready because why do you get the Holy Ghost because you already were a son or daughter of God in the mind of God that's why that's why Jud Judas couldn't get the Holy Ghost in the soul because he he was the son of predition not the son of almighty God or a son of almighty God it only goes to Sons and Daughters aren't you glad if you received it aren't you glad you're a son and daughter of God hallelujah that's why I got it because I am a Son of God hallelujah and brother gives the example uh you know if I were to uh you know if I were in the Old Testament uh you know and and I was going to adopt my son Malachi well then I'd give I'd hand over the Reigns to my my classroom and he would take over my classroom and I would adopt him and I say well now you're in charge I'd hand over my bank account to him and he'd be the inheritor my oldest son you know and so uh that's the same thing here with the baptism of the Holy Ghost God gives over the authority to you of the word of God and now you can speak the word hallelujah and now you have power over evil spirits come on Church you mothers know you can lay hands on your children and they'll recover it just don't have to be a preacher Hallelujah it's the power and authority that's just one small gift Divine Healing is just one small gift what about the wisdom that can flow out of your lips or the knowledge or the word of faith hallelujah or prophecy or dream or Vision or something like that all that can flow out of a person who's an adopted son or daughter of God that's right hallelujah amen see because you are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying ABA father and brother Adam says that awesome he said he said who received the Holy H ghost on the day of Pentecost brother man said Sons daughters amen who received the Holy Ghost at Ephesus Sons and Daughters 12 of them Hallelujah who received the Holy Ghost in akan son and daughters hallelujah or maybe it was Napoleon for you or maybe it was Lima for me Hallelujah who received it Sons and Daughters received it Hallelujah that's who always received that's the only people that will receive it praise God and then in John chapter 6 it says how do you know you're a son or daughter because Jesus said you can be taught the word of God only the children of God can be taught the word of God that's why they'll reject serpent SE like God's generals that's why they'll reject Holiness like most Pentecostals now reject Holiness right they let the women wear split skirts and high heels and makeup and cut their hair they reject it because they it shows they can't be taught the word of God that doesn't mean they're not saved it just shows if they're saved they're foolish they're not wise to all the word because the Pentecostal church has changed but God's word has never changed Hallelujah may God help us not to change Hallelujah that's the Temptation if you live a long life Satan will just try to wear you out over the years and decades to get you to compromise a little bit and so that's what I'm going to have to withstand Hallelujah as a young man of 44 Hallelujah notice I said young man verse seven wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ Hallelujah Church you have have an eternal inheritance because you're a son or daughter of God hallelujah you've got a mansion we know in the future home but also that Mansion is a new glorified body that will never sin Hallelujah brother R uses it both Mansion for your your uh glorified body or theophany that you go to live in because the Bible said it's a house not made with hands in the heavens but we also know we'll build houses in the Millennium and then we know there's mansions in the future home praise God because it's a city 1,000 500 miles wide and 1,500 miles high praise God a pyramid city so we have thus say the Lord we can prove it I think I have five examples in the New Testament of groups that were already saved already Believers but not yet born again so who we going to believe Joel oene or the chapel or a Baptist Church or we going to believe the Bible we're going to be the Bible and thus sayeth the Lord from a prophet of God you know one time I had a good Baptist or good yeah a good Baptist friend from the chapel he's a good man he was a school teacher and I was painting with him one summer and I brought up Acts 19 and he said oh yeah I I've read that before he said but that doesn't apply to us I said it's in the Bible buddy as I'm trying toay I'm sorry it's in the Bible how can you say it doesn't apply to them but then acts 238 applies somehow see it's just you know they try to shift away and just say oh this doesn't apply to me the whole thing applies to me if you look look at the New Testament praise God the whole thing applies see they just want to pick and choose it's not a buffet you got to eat all the word of God [Music] hallelujah live by the entire book eat the whole book God told Ezekiel and John eat the book Hallelujah but see they want to spit out these wonderful seed words that that's okay I like to eat those seeds Hallelujah Glory so now this ties along with it the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother said what we need is an old stirring of the Holy Spirit again and the church said brother it had to come to me before God ever manifested himself we need another Russian Mighty Wind scent as it did on the day of Pentecost they were all religious and followers of Jesus but they had to go and receive the baptism of the spirit is that true and listen here women you got to be salty and listen to this do you realize that up in there they when they all went up 120 to pray they never done like the Baptist shake hands and put their name on the book and saides I'm born again they didn't have it like that there's no such a scripture as that in the Bible and we Catholic people who come lick out our tongue and take the Holy Eucharist and say we got the Holy Ghost no such scripture in the Bible we methodists go on prohibition for six months or now they're they're uh they're going on lent and now they they give up chocolate for a few weeks or uh they give up TV or or Facebook and like it's some big sacrifice the real sacrifice is dying out to yourself and getting rid out of all sin in your life not for a few months but for the rest of your days hallelujah let's do a lifetime lent not just a few weeks of Lent hallelujah it's hypocritical praise God and you go right back to it they say oh I can't wait till I can go back to EA all that chocolate and ice cream and then they wonder why they're overweight inflamed and unhealthy Hallelujah and getting cancer and all kinds of diabetes and everything like that it shows you're wrong in the first place you ought to quit those dirty habits that you got that's right I remember what it was like I was going to share that with brother Chris you all saw my you all see my picture last summer when I showed all those red spots oh yes it's a dirty habit it's addiction it's lust of the flesh but we overcome it by the holy spirit it's a beautiful thing called Temperance Hallelujah Glory there's no such a thing in the scripture as a lent or prohibition but the Bible said when the day of Pentecost was fully come there came a sound from heaven like a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting we've had two people tell me uh three the wind of the Holy Spirit came in into this Sanctuary right here hallelujah Glory Emma amen and haua both all three said that that the wind of the Holy Spirit just come blowing through hallelujah oh my glory to God all things are possible to them that believe Hallelujah a heart's got to be prepared a heart's got to be ready a heart's got to want to be born again amen hallelujah just like on the day of Pentecost they were ready they were prayed up they didn't care how they acted they just wanted to know they had God's promise Hallelujah that's what we need people today that they don't they don't care how they act they don't care what people will think of them they just want to declare the wonderful works of God they just want to get in the spirit of God hallelujah amen glory was so hard to find people that really want to get in the spirit of God and let go and let God hallelujah they want to act all classical and all under the control all the time well I can't even do that as a preacher can hardly do that Hallelujah and if I'm under the anointing how about you we all got to get under the anointing praise God if I can raise my voice like this and preach and try to get inspiration for an hour at a time and you can't do it for five minutes something's wrong hallelujah it's just yielding to your gift praise God or yielding to God's Gift Hallelujah that's right and the power of God so enclosed those people and anointed them till they run out into the streets screaming and dancing and hollering and acting like a bunch of drunk people that's the scripture thus sayeth the Lord oh don't you love it amen and let me speak this just a minute brother says in 1956 Chicago Illinois boy Chicago could use a Revival but they probably missed it did you know where this class come from class is of the devil so he's talking about just unemotional worship going to church now that's thus sayith the lord of the Bible class and PP came from the Devil in the very beginning when Cain and Abel come up to worship Cain come before the Lord in class Abel came in righteousness by Revelation so Cain just offered uh fruits and he worked a lot harder than Abel right as far as all the weeding and everything he just brought fruit but Abel Abel brought life because the life is in the blood he brought a life a dead life and and that's a type of what we need praise God we need the spiritual life or the baptism of the Holy G ghost and it's through an emotional experience that others can see and hear Brother Patrick why don't you read that acts 233 and uh Claude why don't you read acts 15 or 11:15 you got your Bibles there Brothers if you got your Bible let's go there acts 233 see there has to be when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's not just some classical thing like some under contr control kind of thing is you actually lose control Hallelujah and God just like when a baby's born a baby screams and cries and and you try to Hudd hug it up and cuddle it by God's grace it's a noisy thing you can see a baby born you can hear a baby born that's in the natural but it's also in the spiritual praise God so brother Patrick can you read acts 233 brother amen the church said God shed this forth It's almost like he gets the shedding the uh the illustration of pouring out his heart upon the people pouring out his love he shed this forth and everybody could see the shedding of God's love and hear it by God's grace Hallelujah that's right you'll see it and hear it and then brother uh uh brother Claude at the beginning so it fell the same way in Samaria it fell the same way at cornelius's house as it did at the beginning that's because Jesus Christ is the same it's always going to fall the same when the Holy Ghost comes on you you you'll say something you'll move they they they can see something happen to you remember in uh Albuquerque New Mexico brother Adam saw the pillar of fire uh anoint a woman and first when the Holy Ghost anointed her she threw up her hands and then she screamed at the top of her voice and brother said There It Is receive it while it's here he said open yourself up you can be born again Hallelujah am Glory that's simple just lifting your hands you could see it and you can hear it she screamed and praise the Lord she gave God glory but it's thus sayith the Lord just to walk up and say give me my uh give me my wafer give me my uh drink or I want to sign a pledge I I'll come to church every Sunday I promise I'll pledge that for six months until football season starts you know the sign of these pledges that's not the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's of the devil but when you get the Holy Ghost brother said you can't wait for those doors to open because your soul only feeds on one thing the word of God hallelujah and he says you can't wait to Fellowship with all your your brothers and sisters in the body of Jesus Christ glory to God I love it now look when Cain came he brought the fruits of the field everything that grows the flowers and everything and decorated his altar he worshiped God a true picture of the carnal church member today most churches are going to have flowers all over their altars Church there's nothing wrong with that but brother mam said you're the one that needs to be on the altar Glory praise God we're the ones that need to be seeking God [Music] hallelujah we're the ones that got to be serious down down to business with God the carnal-minded pastor who wants a church that sits higher than the rest of them in the city well you know that's not me I don't never compare our church to well I can't wait till we're bigger than the chapel I can't wait till we're bigger than faith family brother Malachi the faith is bigger the word of the portion of the word is greater that's right and he says all them all those plush seats and a million dooll pipe organ uh this was a free hand-me-down right here so not exactly a million dollars and this was a couple hundred dollars maybe uh that was all those H 12 13 years ago good good investment not exactly a million probably two or three hundred good job good job see but if if the pastor don't have those things they think they're less Hallelujah but we're not less we're Sons and Daughters praise God and I've gone to some of those services and I feel like a ice cube brother Bram said they need an usher to walk through and break the ice cubes off the top of their doors he said what they need is a Holy Ghost Fire Hallelujah the fire of God the wind of God to blow through the church set the church on fire get them loving Jesus worshiping Jesus praying more serving God using their gifts we need the fire of the Holy Ghost that's what we need the spirit of burd hallelujah amen not class not million dollars not plush seats not a piano organ we need ourselves to be the organ to sing unto God Almighty Hallelujah God don't want to put up a choir here God wants you to be the choir God Wants You on the altar praise God glory god don't care for that he said that don't have a thing you that's a lot of those great big places that that done your people until they just about pour poppers and everything else with all your stuff to put in the church and thousands of heathens dying on the mission field without knowing Christ one time right it's a disgrace to Christianity so by my brother and I say they can put millions of dollars in a church but how many how how could how much better would that money have been spent helping other people overseas my goodness oh if you could only see one time you'd know what I was speaking of build that million-dollar Church two-thirds of the world never heard of Jesus what a pit brother Ram says here some more thus sayith the Lords where's my CL oh I'm only half an hour in praise God now this first one is kind of the same it's on this along the same lines of classical preaching but remember Church most churches are all classical today very few now there's some Pentecostals that are still pretty good they get in the spirit but very few and I'm saying we've got to get in the spirit of God more praise God I like it when we repent in the prayer line or that's really good too but also we should be in the spirit to work worship God hallelujah or to give a word to somebody or or go pray for somebody or pray for them to be healed or or tell them a dream you had or something be led by the Holy Spirit give God some Glory Hallelujah how many people come to church and they never even raise their hands one time to heaven where they never even shout one time Glory or praise God they can't even get in the spirit that much praise God God help us to be in the spirit Hallelujah and to really mean it praise God not every Service is like that you know I I'm a balance preacher I understand sometimes I'm up I'm sometimes down but when was the last time you felt the Holy Ghost flow out of you like a river praise God hallelujah when was the last time you really felt it flow out of you and you you and you thought my this is what must the day of Pentecost must have been like praise God hallelujah when was the last time you thought that has it been since Napoleon for some of us couple years and church that's not to condemn me or anybody else but last summer I was dancing the spirit praise God uh you know we dance in the spirit sometimes but I'm talking about spontaneous being led of God being so filled with God's spirit you just got to let it flow out like a rushing Mighty River Hallelujah that's what Jesus said it was glory to God how many hearing me tonight by God's grace Glory brother Bram said the acts two saints were informal Holy Rollers now he's talking about uh balum and Bao he said Bao tried to tell balam come over here curse these Israelites I don't want them in my country there's a bunch of Holy Rollers I don't want them in here you say holy rollers brother Braham yes they were Holy Rollers can you prove it yes when they crossed through the red blood of the Red Sea saw the taskmasters Dead behind them poor brother Dr Moses got informal he throwed his hands up in the air began screaming and singing in the Holy Spirit praise God Amen all the task Masters are drowned we're free Hallelujah you're free tonight in the Holy Spirit you don't have to be a slave to sin Hallelujah you're free praise God that's what we need people to be free people to be on fire people that know what they're talking about praise God not just a preacher not just a a singer or something like that everybody can experience the presence of God hallelujah and Miriam the prophetess she got informal and grabbed a tambourine and run down the bank beating and dancing and the daughters of Israel fing her dancing beating on the tambourine if that ain't an old fashion Holy Roller meeting I've never seen one in my life they were informal Holy Rollers you don't want to believe that but that's the truth that's thus sayith the Lord the scripture sure they were Holy Rollers inter denominational Holy Rollers that's the vine over here though Hallelujah so this supports the previous thus sayith the Lord about classical preaching classical preaching just lets everybody shake hands get on your knees like the Catholic we went to the Catholic church at one time and up and down and up and down up down okay then everybody come up and get their wafer that's about all it was I'm like what are they saying in Latin I can't even hardly I can't follow anything don't hear any words now my children might know a few words but it just it's it's just confusion like a Babel Hallelujah by God's grace but that's what we need we need an informal Holy Spirit we need to we need to be under the spirit so we don't do the same thing every single spir every single service Hallelujah church that's what brother BR says the Holy Ghost is spontaneous he might have you spontaneously do something that magnifies his name right just something simple just standing up everybody sitting down just standing up during the preaching when you're blessed that can be the Holy Ghost being spontaneous but if people just do the same thing every single service there's no spontaneous that it's time to go checking up to see if you got the spontaneous one in your soul praise God hallelujah that's right church that's what it was they were not they were not formal uh in the book of Acts they were informal praise God hallelujah now moving on thus sayith the Lord Brother said there's one Prophet messenger uh Malachi Matthew 119 and10 would you read that John the Baptist was a prophet messenger a lot of people don't know that he was more than a prophet he was also a messenger of the Covenant right he was preaching pointing them to Christ which would be the New Covenant right and that's what brother Ram is doing here he's a prophet messenger at the end time Same Spirit of Elijah and he's pointing us back to the New Covenant because the churches have rejected it right I'm going to show you a list they cut their hair they get adulteries they basically naked in the church they they they're not going to get the Covenant they're not going to get the Holy Ghost that's right Hallelujah they might not get to heaven brother Rod said and the church Said Amen brother rod that's right they'll be very lucky if they scarcely get into heaven the Bible said if judgment begins at the house of God what about the Sinner and the unbeliever Peter said they scarcely be saved if they repent on their deathbed Mal Matthew uh 119 and 10 very good it's not Sunday night but there's two claps but Hallelujah brother said first we will have one Prophet messenger Revelation 10:7 when he singular shall begin to sound there's never been an age where God gave his people two Major Prophets at one time time he gave Enoch alone Noah alone Moses alone remember even with Ezekiel Jeremiah and uh Isaiah they were all spread out in different places Hallelujah John the Baptist came alone and remember brother brandom said we brother taught we know there's got to be a spirit of Elijah to come at the end time to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers because John the Baptist was the fathers pointing them to the second coming turn the hearts of the fathers to the children they long to see the coming of the Lord they long to live to see the coming of the Lord you know one of these days church I'm going to preach that both Peter and Paul said the Lord's coming was very soon if you know the Bible well one of these days I'm going to get to that study I just think of it while I'm at the pulpit at the wrong place but both of them said it's very soon it's very soon and people stumble at that like oh maybe they didn't write the Bible no it's not from our perspective it's from God's perspective am Hallelujah that's right church because it's not soon like years it's like soon God a thousand years is has one day with God hallelujah and even in that like we just saw in Corinthians even in that Paul said this is not the Lord talking this is me this is Paul giving my best opinion so what does that mean that means yes that's part of scripture but that's the scripture that's thus sayith the Lord that's Paul's opinion not thus sayith God's word it's just a true record it's a infallible record that that's Paul's opinion just like all the Old Testament right a lot of stories a lot of mistakes their mistakes aren't thus sayth the Lord It's the record of the mistakes that's thus say the Lord everybody with me people try to make Paul's opinions thus say the Lord right but it's not he said this is my opinion just like they try to make brother Ram's opinions thus say the lord it's the same demon same same demon power right it's the same Spirit of idolatry it's say Antichrist Spirit trying to exalt a man but God said I will not share my glory with anybody praise God I only I only give it to myself Hallelujah now now in the last day there is to be a prophet not a prophetess though in this age there are more women purporting to give God's revelation than men that's true and the infallible word says that he the prophet will turn the Mysteries Revelation 10:7 to the end time people and turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers Revelation I'm sorry Malachi 4:6 there are those who say that God's people are going to come together through a collective Revelation I challenge that statement it's a bald invalid assumption in the face of Revelation 107 now I do not deny that people will prophesy in this last age and their Ministries can and will be correct I do not deny that there will be prophets even as in the days of Paul when there was one agabus a prophet who prophesied of a famine I agree that is so but I deny upon the infallible evidence of the word that there's more than one major prophet messenger who reveal the Mysteries like the Seven Seals like the church ages like the godhead Hallelujah contained in the word and who has the ministry to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers thus sayith the Lord by his unfailing words stands and shall and be Vindicated there's one Prophet Messenger to this age and our church said amen like brother Ram said bring up any preacher in these last UH 60 years since brother Ram's uh been off the scene show me one who has all these thus sayi the Lords that are correct like brother Ram there's not a one of them this many all the way all this list here I'm just scratching the surface of it here by God's grace putting the word together by the leadership of the Holy Spirit there can only be one Prophet Messenger to the age just like John the Baptist was the one Prophet Messenger to point them to Christ brother R is the one Prophet Messenger to point us back to Christ Hallelujah that's right brother ramam said thus sayth the Lord a woman with cut hair is not born again thus sayeth the Lord and he uses Old Testament scripture and New Testament scripture you say cutting hair what's it got to do brother let's stop here a minute I feel somebody resenting that might have been out there on the wire somewhere listen a hair to the woman is a Nazarite vow hair to Samson was a Nazarite vow and when a woman cuts off her hair she absolutely denies her Nazarite vow that she's a bride to Christ because there that one thing she spoils the whole picture correct a Nazarite is one that's consecrated for a purpose is that right Samson was consecrated to an age and to a purpose therefore he had long hair the woman that's a child of God lets her hair grow to show that she's consecrated to every word of God in fact that's what the hair represents the word of God and so you wouldn't you wouldn't allow me brother Patrick you wouldn't allow me to say oh can I cut out Revelation 20 can I just cut that out you he's already shaking his head no that's the same thing a woman should say when hear some scissors can I trim your hair no no like instantly no no don't touch my hair because the Bible says the spirit of God is your covering and the spirit and the word are one so a woman's uncut hair means all the words she's under all the leadership all the the headship of the word praise God do you know that's in the Bible the Bible said the spirit is the covering it's Isaiah now I think it's Chapter 30 but uh I'll get it I just came across that as I was reading through Isaiah I finished Isaiah n in Song of Solomon Spirit if I could spell it right yes it's Isaiah 30 ver1 woe to the rebellious children and sayth the Lord that take counsel but not of me that cover with the covering but not with my spirit that they may add sin to sin so what was the covering in the Old Testament the Holy Spirit right and now go to 1 Corinthians 11 what's the Bible say is a covering the hair is the covering not a cloth like I saw some women today nice women but they got Closs on thinking that makes them holy church that's a man-made covering God's covering is a holy God made covering I just proved it to you right God can't change he can't have a spiritual covering uh and then change the covering to a man-made cloth covering or a hat or whatever it is Cap 1 Corinthians 11 always excited about them caps verse 15 1 Corinthians 11:15 but if a woman have long hair it's a glory for her for her hair is given her for a covering and that's the verse I share with those sisters on uh Christmas Eve 2023 that's that's the day they got delivered from that demonic power of the cloth is the evidence of the Holy Ghost and that's the night the Satan attacked me and tried to choke me to death but my wife called on Jesus twice Jesus Jesus and the choking left hallelujah thank God my wife's casting off demons Hallelujah that's right church so it is music you come in here all bundled up and all angry or all distracted and Malachi plays a song or sings a song and you get free the devil just was cast out Hallelujah just like David did see she's kind this the covering is the spirit or now the hair is a covering but it represents the spirit or the word you don't cut off some of the word and say I can do without that we need all the word of God brother said if she cuts it off I don't care how much she dances sings in the choir speaks in tongues runs up and down all kind of Aid societies she's dead that's thus sayith the Lord the word of God now he quotes the wrong scripture it's 1 Corinthians 11 but that's after the word that's after the sentence ends so he goes back into his human side yeah she's denied her Nazarite vow and sold out to the god of the Modern Age she does it now shame on you ler woman right like I said that last time that's the challenge show me one verse God asked a Godly woman to cut her hair you'll never find it you'll be reading into the tribulation period right because you be left here you won't go in the rapture and church you know why look it up in your Bible well I'm sorry not I'm talking to the I'm talk I'm not talking to you guys I'm talking to the audience I'm talking about the critics I'm sorry I don't mean to talk like that the critics need to look it up in their Bible starting to get a little bit angry uh righteous anger that's right right be angry and sin not look up the word dishonor means to put shame who suffers the repulse or whom some Hope Has deceived when a woman cuts her hair it's like she's deceived her husband she's brought a repulse to her husband what's a repulse it's a intense distaste or dislike it's just H you've disrespected me you've Dishonored me it's a repulse it's a disgusting thing she's trying to be a man she's trying to take my role I'm I'm the husband that's right right you've all heard him say though you've all heard some of these worldly women say I'm going to go cut my hair and show my husband I've had people tell me that women I'm going to go cut my hair to show my husband who's the boss it's all over you can find on social media too just look at it that that that's what it is that's what the Bible says that's not what brother brandom said or brother Jesse or brother anybody it's what the Bible says how many Bible believers do we have here it's also a shame which means dishonorable same thing so see it's kind of a little bit re reciprocal repetitive there by God's grace it's a repulse for women to put scissors to her hair because it represents the spirit of God represents the word of God it's the same repulse for a man to grow out dreadlocks like they do or whatever they do they got long hair like a woman uh flows like they got uh Head and Shoulders on or something like that it's just as dishonorable and disgusting for a man to not cut his hair that's right now this stumbles people but in the but in the old days it was so serious because people were more knowledgeable about the word of God today you know a godly man if his wife cut her hair she he might be discouraged but it was so serious in brother bram's day it was so serious they would threaten divorce now God hates divorce but it was such a serious thing that the the man could he he he could divorce her but he couldn't remarry again because there's only one cause for remarriage now I can't find a Bible example where that ever happened but what would you say what would a husband say if he felt totally repulsed by his wife disrespected by his wife or she started wearing the flapper skirts and started smoking and cutting her hair and going out like the flappers of the 1920s he has a right he can put her away but he just can't marry again because the only cause for remarriage we went through was unconfessed fornication of a vow a false vow we went through that like Jesus said in Matthew 5 and Matthew 19 and also the chapter on vows I think it's numbers 18 if I'm not mistaken brother says let me tell you something a lot of you women this is in 56 again this was the year yeah this was the year go brother said thus say the lord it's this year America will turn back to God back to the zusa Street Revival or she'll go further into sin thus sayith the Lord and look what's happened to her do you also know 56 was the year Elvis went skyrocketing uh uh popular see they chose Judas instead of brother brandham right brother is not God I'm just saying they chose Judas instead of the prophet of God right in other words they chose uh Janis and jamers instead of Moses they chose balum instead of Moses something like that I'm not exalting brother bandam you know me okay you know me people I'm just saying they reject the word of God and they take a judas's scariot who sold out uh Elvis Presley brother knew brother brother knew Elvis Presley's mother and pastor and he learned some of those movements in the church but then he perverted them he perverted some of the movements in the freedom right just the joy of the Lord you know think about the joy of the Lord how we could but he perverted it started shaking the wrong body parts Hallelujah brother B said his mother was disappointed in him and the preacher was all disappointed just like the modern day uh who is that Beyonce that started in church all these people start in church all these Whitney Houston start in churches and look what they turned out to be drug addicts demon-possessed uh pleasure lovers lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God stay in the church stay true to God give your gifts to God hallelujah don't sell out to the world Hallelujah you'll regret it and like Elvis you'll die on a toilet to or like whendy Houston you'll die in your bathtub who knows what the rest of these people are going to die like what a disgrace you want to die like uh FF Bosworth brother raham said for a whole hour he was on his deathbed and he was hugging invisible people that God used him to save for a whole hour before he died Hallelujah that's how we want to die hallelujah amen or like sister Karen Ro's mother when she and all four brothers were in there in the hospital in Arizona they heard angels singing in the room before she died Hallelujah that's how you want to die if if you die some of you might not die we might not die there's a possibility amen glory to God we could be changed in the moment twinkling of an eye but let me tell you something he's talking about when the woman uh wash took down her hair and washed jesus' feet with her hair now look I love this joke brother man say a lot of you women tonight would have an awful time doing that you'd have to stand on your head to do it and that'd be a modest right well they probably have pants on anyway that's an Abomination anyhow to wear a man's garment shame on you brother says this is in 56 50 years after the Holy Ghost Fell inza Street the Bible said the hair is given to a woman for her glory and the Bible gives rights gives any man a right to leave and divor divorce and leave his wife that'll cut her hair that's the Bible CU it's a repulse that's thus sayith the Lord too bad you got away from the oldfashioned trainings isn't it remember 1 Corinthians 7 the Bible said uh if they're not pleased to dwell together they can go their separate ways but they either got to remain single or come back together that's the Bible evidence right there a a wife disrespect a husband like that now church I've heard this trash around the message people men will try to talk their wives into getting to their hair just so they can divorce them and marry a younger woman that's demon possession that's a demon possessed man who's got a spirit of lust he's got a spirit of adultery on him that's right but see they don't even read the quote where can brother where do you ever say you can marry again and if even if he said it it's got to be in the Bible and it don't say it in the Bible praise God deceived demon possessed people too bad you got away from the oldfashioned training isn't it we used to sing we let down the bars we compromise with sin you let let down the bars the Sheep got out but how did the goats get in because you let down the bars that's how the goats get in you start compromising on the scripture that's why like last week people that come here I know they're wearing makeup I'm going to preach on makeup like I did because I don't care what they say I'm not taking the bars down I'm GNA preach God's word I'm GNA keep the goats out hallelujah amen or I know they're cutting their hair I'm going to preach on hair you don't want to serve God you don't don't have to but if you want to serve God welcome home hallelujah praise God Amen we don't want goats to get in here like I've said before when I received this message nobody had to ask me to come to church nobody had to ask me to pray and read my Bible nobody had to ask me to pay ties nobody had to ask me to do anything because I was in love with Jesus and when you love Jesus you keep the commands Hallelujah nobody ask asked me to say please don't wear short shorts brother Jesse nobody say please don't uh let your hair grow long brother Jesse because God was already telling me that and because I love God I obeyed God and when we got to beg people and kind of move them on and ask them to obey the word of God they're not born again that's right Church boy kind of a hard sermon tonight huh anybody else got a red face out there boy the preacher is preaching hard tonight it's a Well I got to sometimes it's the the word of God it's thus sayeth the Lord hallelujah remember the only woman who ever painted her face Jezebel the dogs licked her blood right that's the only woman once Jezebel and then twice Israel said to have pain in their faces to go make love to all their Heathen Idols they actually did that they paint in their faces and go out there and sacrific their children to idols and adulteries and fornications they actually did that it's a heathen trait Hallelujah remember I love that verse don't the Bible say David didn't said uh David said God Made You fearfully and wonderfully so paint your face no he didn't say that he said God already made you fearfully and wonderfully wonderful are God's Works Hallelujah Glory got five minutes brother BR said thus sayith the Lord on denomination of fruit after all the denominations is played out they didn't have any light to begin with uh there'll be a day that can't be called day or night that's speaking of Zechariah what do they doing what what are they doing what does a Lemon do on an orange tree so brother man says the True Believers like an orange on an orange tree but you can cut the branches on orange tree and Graft in other fruit tree branches but it'll still produce the previous tree that they're a part of like a lemon if you put a lemon Branch into a apple Tre I'm sorry into a orange tree branch the life of that orange tree will will go through the uh the the new grafted Branch but it still produce a lemon even though it's uh connected to the life of the orange tree Hallelujah brother Ram had Deus sharan showed him that he showed him all these different fruits coming out of the same tree but it's an orange tree and that's what brother Ram learned here he learned that all these different churches are they they draw life from the Holy Spirit but they produce the life of the tree that they're from so they're going to produce Baptist fruit or Methodist fruit hallelujah or Catholic fruit right I've known Catholics that uh I've known Catholics that have good testimonies brother R said he prayed for many Catholics and God did miracles for many Catholics right and they can be nice people they can be very kind people but look at their look at their whole life look at the entire fruit of their life Glory he says it what does a Lemon do on an orange tree it takes the original life of the orange that's coming up and perverts it through a lemon that's what the denominations has done to the word of God made the word of God of none effect by their Traditions that's thus sayith the spirit of the Lord now that's a statement right there they brought forth lemons grapefruits and not oranges just like the Pharisees of Jesus day they said they sat Moses seat but they wanted to kill the one Moses wrote about they said they were the children of Abraham but they wanted the kill the one who said before Abraham was I am Hallelujah see wrong fruit right they go to widow's houses and make merchandise of women try to get their money and everything Hallelujah that's the wrong kind of fruit that's not Holy Ghost fruit praise God and that's what we got today look at these just the examples again look at the corrupt fruit in denominations look at the corrupt fruits that they've done to the thus say the Lord truth so instead of taking brother AMS thus sayith the Lord back that take us back to the Bible they'd rather have corrupt fruit and they so a lot of them won't even talk about brother Brandon the only ones that will are so deceived they're the NRA people I'm sorry NR yeah NRA new uh n New Apostolic Reformation they call themselves Apostles and they're not they call themselves prophets and they're not like the Bill Johnson the bethl group The Kenneth Copeland Group all those hyper charismatics they're the only ones that talk about brother brandom because they they want the Miracles of brother Bram but they don't want the doctrine of brother brandham which is actually the doctrine of the Bible so they don't want the Bible they want the signs Miracles and wonders but they don't want the god they don't want the holy life of the Bible praise God that's right church so what do they do they allow adulteries and they reject thus sayith the Lord on marriage and divorce what kind of fruit is that they allow immodest clothing like sexy dressed women they reject thus sayith the Lord all modesty that we have they allow disgusting crossdressing and we got thus sayith the Lord out of the Bible and look at all this trans movement and the perversion of seeing a man dressed like a woman you see just see it this week a a trans boy tried to go into a girls bathroom and calls all this just another Wicked thing this week another all these girls there in the in the bathroom Are all uh scarred because of this it's a sexual perversion to crossdress right it's total sexual perversion it's exactly right God said it back in uh 1500 BC in the days of Moses Hallelujah and they allow false conversions tell people they have the Holy Ghost when they don't makes a bunch of deceived church members do I got it do I not do I got it do they not if God ever fell on you you would know you got it because your life lines up with the word of God hallelujah and everybody could see it and everybody could hear it praise God that's right Glory that's right see they reject thus sayith the Lord on the well I don't want to take Acts 19 like my dear friend he was a good man too I don't that doesn't apply to us well then who does it apply to how when did you get anointed to uh be able to say you're the one who gets us choose what applies and what doesn't oh yeah he said you can't make the book of Acts Doctrine where did you ever hear that from the Bible said in Acts two they gave themselves to Doctrine and the reading of the word so as soon as they got saved they want a Doctrine they want to know how to live right that's what we want to know how do we live right Glory if you ever get saved if you really fall in love with God you'll gladly receive the word of God and you want more of the doctrine more of the Miracles more of the love of God you and all that God has for you praise God but don't forget you got to be a partaker of the suffering as well everybody wants the power of the Resurrection but you remember you must suffer and in suffering is fellowship Hallelujah that's when you really fellowship with God when you suffer with him he becomes real to you you realize oh he is with me he never left me he never forsook me in my suffering and then I can have Fellowship oh Lord I know I know a little bit of taste of how you felt I know a little bit of how job I know a little bit how Paul I know about the persecution I know about the suffering Hallelujah and then they deny the prophet messenger like the God's General guy they deny the the very messenger God sent to them and then they allow women to repulse their husbands and not just their husbands then they repulse Christ and then they repulse God according to the Holy Ghost headship in 1 Corinthians chapter 11 I think I'll stop right there let's into our feet by God's grace that's the hour there I passed my over I went a little over hour Malachi can come here by God's grace so next time by God's grace we'll pick up there how many enjoying the thus sayith the Lords praise God it's a real uh it's a real uh blessing to us I'm going put part two on there so I don't forget Hallelujah in every age Church in every age when God sent a prophet the Bible said if they received it the Bible said God will prosper you right I think it's 2 Chronicles 20:20 says receive His prophets and God will prosper you and I'm just paraphrasing and church what's the prospering people want today they just want big bank accounts that's what they think is prospering but that's not real prospering it's having the character of Christ that's what profits us on this Earth hallelujah it's to be able to suffer like Christ and yes to pray for the sick or or speak the word of God or speak to the mountain or something like that those are all wonderful things but that's the Prosper remember the Bible said I wish you prosper in health even as your soul it's about the prospering of your spiritual nature your soul the very person that you are and that's all you're taking to heaven with you is the person that you be come through the word of God hallelujah and that's given to us with thus sayeth the Lord the scriptures hallelujah what a blessing let's bow our heads here tonight Heavenly Father Lord I've been very strict and straight tonight Lord I following your leadership Lord by the grace of God thank you Lord for these thus say the Lord sometimes we need a reminder Lord God I know I do Lord it reminds us that because we are the sons and daughters of God you have sent forth your spirit in our hearts crying ABA father Lord and it shows when our friends or loved ones they walk away from this ministry of brother brandham they're walking away from thus saith the Lord the truth of the Bible Lord Our Hope and prayer is that they can be saved Lord God that they will not blaspheme that they will not speak against it hope and prayer Lord is that their hearts will eventually change and those'll see there's something different about sister there's something different about our brother I need to go look into that again I just read that in my Bible I just heard that preached the Holy Spirit quickens something to me Hallelujah Lord God we want to keep the goats out Hallelujah we want to keep sheep in this church Lord God oh God make a sheep Lord God protect us with thy rod and thy staff the rod protects us the staff draws Us close Closer to You Lord God lead us beside Still Waters lead us into Green Pastures and Lord if we walk through the valley of shadow of death I know you'll be with us Lord God that's the suffering to have fellowship with you even when walking through a valley Hallelujah Jesus thank you for the reality of the word Lord I appreciate the churches I've been to over over the years Lord I appreciate the I can tell some people are being sincere but Lord I realize they're missing thus sayith the Lord they have so much classical oh God help us not to be classical here Lord God help us to have a real move of the Holy Spirit Lord God let the wind of the Holy Ghost flow again through here Lord God visit us Lord you said I will pour sayith God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh oh God visit your people Lord God May maybe we're praying in advance for a future meeting maybe we're praying for tonight Lord but pour out your spirit upon your people Lord God where we don't become classical and in just a routine Lord let us have a real Holy Ghost experience that people can see and hear and then we have a life to back it up afterwards Lord God where you guide us into all truth we have the spirit of Truth so we're not deceived into lies and false Doctrine and sin and addiction Grant it Lord Jesus Grant it God make us holy Lord God make us holy and only the Holy Ghost can make us holy dear God hallelujah send your spirit Lord God hallelujah we need you Lord tonight especially these young people Lord father Grant it Lord grant it Lord thou knowest all things just guide me here Lord in Jesus Christ's name the Saints [Music] said get stop the live
