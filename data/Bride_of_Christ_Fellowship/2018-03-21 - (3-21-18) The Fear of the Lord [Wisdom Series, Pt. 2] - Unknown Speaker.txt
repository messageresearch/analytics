TRANSCRIPT
========================================
greetings everybody god bless you it's good to be with you I'd say over the internet and just want to greet everybody the name of the Lord Jesus Christ thank you for your prayers I know a lot of people have been praying for our family some people have sent me texts and asked how the family is doing and we've had a real rough week but we're starting to come out of it by the grace of the Lord so thank you for your prayers I really appreciate that I do want to say I'm sorry about Sunday morning I went to bed with a fever and I thought perhaps it would pass because I've gone to bed before with a fever and woke up and then the fever was gone but the fever didn't pass and it lasted even to today but now it seems like it's gone by God's grace so I do apologize because we didn't have a service but we didn't have a preacher and didn't have a song leader or musician available so I thought it would be best to cancel service so I apologize for any inconvenience now I talked to brother Adam on a text and I need to text brother van yet but we thought about putting a plan in place if this ever happens again in the future and so I'll text brother bang and brother Adam about that and our plan is just to have a prayer service in the future if this should ever happen again if I should ever get sick at the last minute we can't get a preacher in we would just do like a prayer service brother Loras was there he could just lead songs if not we just do prayer and then do a tape of brother Branham so I wasn't able to get ahold of bang early enough and that was my fault so in the future of that ever would happen again that we would just do a prayer service and then listen to tape a brother branham and close the service so I would just need bang and Adam kind of in one Accord about that so that's my plan for the future but I do apologize like I said for Sunday I just didn't think I'd be sick you know I thought I'd be all right so I do apologize about that but I want to let you know hopefully we'll have a plan in place for the future also I sent out an email on Saturday night we have brother Ben Neriah coming on June 24 so that's pretty awesome very thankful for that and then brother Brooks will be here this weekend so hopefully my family and I are all back to complete full health but even if something would happen where I'd get sick again brother Brooks will certainly be here I think he's coming in tomorrow actually so brother Brooks will definitely be here to preach to services on Sunday so we're thankful to the Lord for that and so I do believe that's all the announcements oh and one more thing I hope this is OK tonight I just started having strength around it be around noon or 1:00 2:00 or 3:00 somewhere in the early afternoon you know just to kind of walk around and not be in constant pain I want to thank the Lord for that touch and also my wife just nursing him back to health so it was the longest sickness of my life I can't ever remember being that sick but I do want to thank you for doing this live stream here tonight by the grace of the Lord so anyways with that being said let's just have a word of Prayer and then we'd like to do the Bible study on the fear of the Lord I'm sure you can see the title there of this YouTube video so it's the fear of the Lord Bible study and this is wisdom series part 2 so let's just have a word of Prayer as we look at this thought on the fear of the Lord Heavenly Father Lord we thank you God for your mercy and your love we thank you for your son Jesus Christ Thank You Laura that you made a way back to heaven Lord God thank you that you made a way Lord that the righteous can walk along that way Lord and be with you for eternity Lord we're grateful for that so we humble ourselves here tonight Lord we ask that you just bless our little Bible study here father and just thank thank you for the strength Lord that you've given me to get the study ready Lord and to have this study and I pray to bless the hearts of the saints Lord God and our congregation and anyone else who is feeling lead Lord to view this Lord so that's your word Lord strike deep in our hearts father made changes Lord draws closer to you Father in Jesus Christ's name Amen so I like to look at the fear of the Lord as we said and just remember it remember that wisdom and proverbs let's define those again we define them last time we preached on the book of Proverbs so wisdom is skillful timely application of the word to your daily life so it's how you daily apply God's Word to your life another way to say it's how well you build or create your life and that's of course done by speaking the word but also obeying the Word of God a proverb is a brief well-known principle that states a general truth so we kind of majored on those last time we looked at how proverbs many times are absolute truths and then sometimes their probability truths which means they happen most of the time so we just have to rightly divide that by the grace of the Lord let's start with the fear of the Lord here now the fear of the Lord is defined in the Hebrew as moral reverence and so reverence means honor respect or profound adoration and fear is the prerequisite to wisdom so we all want wisdom the Bible says wisdom is the principal thing so if you have your Bibles proverbs chapter 4 verse 7 proverbs chapter 4 verse 7 says wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding so the word principle in the Hebrew means the first in order of rank so the highest priority in our life is to get wisdom skillfully applying the Word of God to our life or timely application of God's Word to our life that's the most important thing we can get is wisdom of the Holy Spirit when to do this command of God how to do it and that will be pleasing to the Lord now if if wisdom is the principal thing to gain on your earthly journey then the fear of the Lord is your necessary foundation for this journey or we'd say this is your fuel for the journey like if you're making it for you liking it unto a travel you know if your life journey is like traveling if you use that imagery fears your fuel that's what's gonna guide you on your journey of wisdom fear of the Lord is the driving force of your life in order to to gain wisdom and so to lose the fear of the Lord is to lose wisdom fear the Lord is the pre-wet prerequisite it's something that you have to have I have to have it or we lose our way and it's so incredibly important this is because of proverbs 9 verse 10 says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the holy is understand so that's the beginning once you've got fear of the Lord once you've got this honor for God once you have this respect this profound adoration now you've begun on your path of wisdom and we'll get to this a little bit too but remember wisdom also according to proverbs 3:18 wisdom she is a tree of life to them that lay a hold on her so again with that imagery of us on a journey we're journeying to lay a hold on wisdom eventually we lay hold on eternal life but wisdom is this fear the Lord is the driving force on our journey - to live a wise life now this is interesting thought I just kind of came to me as I was studying the word here today if you go to proverbs chapter 2 let's read in proverbs chapter 2 because I asked myself how do we obtain the fear of the Lord now there's different ways in the scripture you know the Bible said when angels appeared or when God's presence appeared the people feared the Lord so God's presence immediately brings fear we know that that's one way to have the fear of the Lord but in our daily lives I think proverbs chapter 2 verses 1 to 11 I'll give us a lot of great insight on how to get wisdom on a daily basis because we all know we don't have visions or dreams or supernatural encounters every single day be great if we did but we don't have that we wouldn't want them to become common so it seems proverbs chapter 2 verses 1 to 11 have this the circumstances where we can gain the fear of the Lord so if the fear of the Lord is the prerequisite the foundation the driving force if it's what's required for this journey to be successful we definitely want to know how do we get this fear of the Lord and I think it's just a beautiful passage of Scripture so to read that proverbs 2 verse 1 so I'll read it for you my son if thou wilt receive my words and hide my commands with thee so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom and apply thine heart to understanding now here it is in verse 3 4 and 5 there's like four steps to gaining the fear of the Lord so I want you to watch this in verse 3 yay if thou cries after knowledge so the first one is crying out and lift us lift us up thy voice for understanding so those are kind of the same crying out lifting up your voice for verse 4 if you seek missed her as silver and searches her asked for hid treasures so I guess I could narrow this down to two crying now and seeking after God now look at verse five this is the the key this is what I believe the Holy Spirit spoke to my heart today when I was studying and preparing look at verse 5 this is beautiful if you do this then in verse 5 then shalt thou understand the fear of God and find the knowledge of God so let's back up again and show that you we've got to cry out and then we've got to seek after knowledge and understanding then we understand the fear of the Lord so it seems this is one way we can really make me trim our lamps we might say this is one way we can really refresh our fear of the Lord is to get alone with God in the prayer closet or when you study or when you seek the Lord to get alone with God cry out in prayer crowd to the Lord and ask God to give you wisdom give you understanding give you the fear of the Lord and then time crying out spend time seeking your answers to your questions reminds me of when David said there's one thing I desired and he said that's to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life that I might inquire in God's temple so just ask God questions and ask God for his understanding for his will and the Bible said if you do this if we cry out and if we seek it as silver then we'll understand the fear of the Lord so that was that was a to me it was a revelation to me and I could say amen to that times in my life when I felt like I've received God's instruction where times I was really diligently praying and crying out and seeking the Word of God for answers and then according to God's rule you know if you draw a knife to God God will draw nigh to you but let's keep reading here because you can just see the some of the more truths about gaining the fear of the Lord look at verse 6 for the Lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding he layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous he's a buckler to them that walk uprightly notice he lays it up so it seems like you got to look up you got to cry up you got to pray you know ask God for those blessings like brother Brian talked about on the Variety story of all these blessings in the variety store we just need a ladder a prayer to just go up there and get what we have need of the wisdom of the Lord verse 8 he keepeth the paths of judgment and preserveth the way of his Saints then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment and equity yay every good path and I think that's what do you want I think that's what I want I want every path I walk in to be God's path and not my own but I want to see the leadership of the Holy Spirit in the path of walking verse 10 when wisdom enters into thine heart and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul discretion shall preserve the understanding shall keep thee so God promised to preserve us and keep us after we've received his wisdom but first we gotta cry out for it and we gotta spend time seeking God and then that's when God helps us to understand the fear of the Lord and after that God grants wisdom to us and remember this all ties in with James chapter 1 if a man needs wisdom he just has to ask God and not doubt so the best way we're not gonna doubt is by spending time with God you know spending more time with God than we do with worldly things we've got to devote our full life to Christ so I hope that helps you I thought that was a beautiful nugget in the scripture about how we understand the fear of the Lord how do we get that we've got to cry out we've got to seek for it like we'd seek for gold like we'd seek a job that would like we'd see seek silver rather so this shows again the power of a prayer life the power of personal study you and God just saying God this is your my time together I just want to study your word I just want to know you more and that's a time when your fear of the Lord seems to increase or your you have a more of a reverence for the Lord okay so I'm looking at our time here so I make over a little over 1/2 hour I know I did some announcements at the beginning and a prayer so next part of this Bible study I want to I want to read over most of the scriptures in Proverbs that talk about the fear of the Lord so there was 14 of them and we'll probably go over most of those and I'll stop and make a few comments on some of them and I thought it might be easiest if we just start at the beginning if you have your Bible I hope I'm not going too fast if I am please pardon me but if you have your Bible we'll just start in proverbs chapter 1 and we'll just flip right through we'll try to hit those 14 scriptures and I'll make sure I share which ones I think will really be a blessing to you that have been blessing to my heart this week as I've been looking at these scriptures okay so the first one is proverbs 1 verse 7 the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction so again this is how you begin to get godly knowledge and this reminds me of the statue of perfect man have fears and parts of faith virtue knowledge so we have to have the fear of the Lord even of course by the probably the first step or second step but at least by the third step because the fear of the Lord is just the beginning of knowledge so at the end of proverbs chapter 1 after wisdom cries out in the street you know I'm pouring out my spirit you know to type to the baptism of the Holy Ghost after she cries out for people to be born again her message is rejected and then at the end of the chapter she makes a mockery of those that wait until the day of judgment to cry out for wisdom and in proverbs 1:29 says for they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the Lord so again it shows that fools will wait till did the day of destruction to get their lives right or asked God how should I live my life and that's such a blessing if we can ask that everyday Lauren what decision should I make today help me not to be hasty hummina pray before every decision I just want to walk in the righteous pass of the Lord all right now proverbs 2 verse 5 we already read that if you cry out and if you seek God like you would gold you'll understand the fear of the Lord proverbs 3 verse 7 this is a really good one the next two I would probably say are some of the most crucial for us today in Laodicea with all the lust of the eyes the pride of life and the lust of the flesh sorry lust of the flesh lust of the eyes and pride of life but especially with the lust of the eyes so let's look at proverbs 8:13 the fear of the Lord I'm sorry proverbs 3 7 pardon me proverbs 3 7 be not wise in thine own eyes fear the Lord and depart from evil so it can truly be said when you have the fear of God you're not exalting yourself in wisdom so you're in a complete state of humility I just you're just sayin I'm just gonna trust God and I'm just gonna humbly just stay away from evil that's when you know you're walking in the spirit and then when you fear God you leave evil and especially for our eyes especially with technology and our cell phones and the internet and all the attractions the TV's whenever we go to Walmart of the eye candy all the temptations of the eyes we've the fear the Lord will cause us to leave all those situations now proverbs 8:13 is probably the most important scripture to me about the fear of the Lord so I want to read that proverbs 8:13 the fear of the Lord is to hate evil pride and arrogancy and the evil way and the froward mouth do I hate so this scripture kind of deals with the the fervency and zeal we preached on last month when we really fear God honor God respect God and then adore him we will begin to hate evil begin to hate sin we'll begin to hate things that causes the stumble like I said with the internet even with YouTube even with any anything that becomes an idol the fear the Lord makes us hate anything that goes against God's Word and I just want to tell a quick testimony one time I was at a public place with a brother in the Lord and he had a burden on his heart and I was really blessed by it and so we were talking and the brother started talking about the dangers of the internet and even in this public place it was such a beautiful testimony of the zeal of the Lord we're in a public place we're surrounded by people and he starts crying he starts raising his voice pointing you know and not upset with me but just upset with evil and the dangers of internet and cell phones and tablets and crying in front of all these people and to me it was a beautiful picture of the zeal of the Lord and it was just just something that I thought truly this brother has the fear of the Lord because he hates evil so much that even in the public place he's denouncing it crying raising his voice almost shouting because he hates evil so much and I thought God bless this individual so I just thought I would share that that I've seen the zeal of the Lord that close and the fear of the Lord as well to fear God is to hate any evil so anytime we hear a cuss word or see an immoral picture or anyone making fun of anybody you know any coarse or idle word you know Jesus said the idle words will be judged and so we can all say God forgive me helped me to cry it allowed for knowledge and understanding and grow and the understanding of the fear of the Lord we all need that from time to time but I think more so as the time goes on we need to grow in the fear of the Lord okay the next one proverbs 9:10 we already read that so we'll skip to proverbs 10:25 the fear of the Lord prolong its days but the years of the wicked shall be shortened so again we know this one is a probability proverb most of the time God will extend the life of a believer and God will shorten a wicked persons life but we got to make sure we understand this the right way that doesn't mean every Christian is gonna live longer than a sinner like we gave the example brother Branham live in 56 years and Hugh Heffner live in 91 years so but most of the time this is a reality when you fear God it actually makes your life last longer when you respect God and you you put his commands first and you depart from evil you're gonna live longer most of the time by the grace of the Lord that really like proverbs 14 verse 2 he that walketh in his uprightness fear the Lord but he that is perverse in his ways despise him so I just I just thought this scripture was nice because it tied in your daily walk with the Lord remember Peter said we don't walk in the vanity of our minds anymore so our walk is our thought life according to Peter so our thoughts have to be constantly I fear God I know God's watching I know God is he's keeping tally of my life like like I was telling somebody recently I said my whole life is live-streamed you know right now we're live stream in that church we live stream but I have this understanding and I'm sure you do too at the angels of God are around us all the time and so our lives are being live-streamed constantly and we want to reverence the Lord and we want to be aware of his presence so in other words our walk must be in the fear of the Lord our thought life will determine our walk in the fear of the Lord okay this is really good too proverbs 14 26 I think this will give you some strength proverbs 14 26 in the fear of the Lord is strong confidence and his children shall have a place of refuge so what a beautiful promise so strong confidence reminds us of faith so in the fear of the Lord is faith we can have a lot of faith trust as we trust that's what faith is is trust it's a revelation you trust God because his wills been made known to you so you could have faith when our hearts condemn us not like I said if we disobey the Word of God we lose that fear and then we step out of the path of wisdom so we've got to obey the Word of God then our heart doesn't condemn us and then as we fear the Lord it gives us strong confidence that God is with us God hears our prayers and he's faithful to his promises and also that's a great promise there to you were we will always have a place of refuge you always have a place of protection when we fear the Lord because God will always protect his people remember of course the scripture says in every trial God will make a way out so we have that confidence proverbs 14 27 is the next one the fear of the Lord is a fountain of life so this goes with the one from chapter 9 about the tree of life so not only is the fear Lord a tree of life I'm sorry wisdom is a tree of life pardon me but the fear of the Lord is a fountain of life well that that just kind of struck me right there if the fear of the Lord is the fountain that fountain flows to the tree which the tree would be wisdom I like that that's a good thought by the grace of Lord so the fear of the Lord is the fountain of life which that would flow to the Tree of Life and that gives us imagery of Revelation chapter 22 how the the fountain the rivers run out of the Tree of Life so beautiful I praise the Lord God given us some fresh revelation there amen in other words though obedience or fear of the Lord departing from evil brings life and so that's what we know whenever we obey God Jesus said those who obey are those who me so praise the Lord for that I like proverbs 1516 this is just a an encouraging scripture for all of us better is little with the fear of the Lord than great treasure in trouble therewith so you have this promise you're always in a better spiritual spot in the fear of the Lord you're always in a better spot your life will always be better than in a life of disobedience or a life that doesn't respect God or doesn't honor God so we want to be very thankful for that that God comforts us and lets us know that our life is better off when we fear the Lord has to be proper is 15 verse 33 the fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom and before honor is humility so not only is the fear of the Lord guide you and start you on your way to journey on your journey to wisdom but as actually instructs you in wisdom so it keeps driving you and guiding you to wisdom that's a beautiful scripture proverbs 16 verse 6 by mercy and truth and Nic witty is purged and by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil so again this is the third time we've seen that the fear of God the love and honor and respect for God the adoration for God will cause us to shun evil proverbs 19 23 we're almost done here by God's grace the fear of the Lord tendeth to life and he that hath it shall abide satisfied he shall not be visited with evil this is a beautiful scripture there's three great thoughts in here the fear of the Lord will lead to life no doubt eternal life and in many cases longer life if you have the fear Lord you're satisfied with life which is a great testimony that's a great virtue that we need to have is just being satisfied with life just because we respect God we know God's in control and then he shall not be visited with evil this may be a probability scripture again because we know Jobe had evil happened to him or you could look at it spiritually spiritually nothing evil can happen to us especially if our soul has been sealed unto the day of redemption Satan can't get into our soul so there's a couple ways you could look at that by the grace of the Lord all right so I lost my spot here okay proverbs 22 for by humility and the fear of the Lord are riches honor and life again so this is a scripture about probability or it could be a spiritual truth because those who fear God are not always rich they're not always given honor or long life but spiritually those who are humble and fear the Lord no doubt have spiritual riches like Jesus talked about in the labor scene church age honor no doubt from God and then eternal life so this can be looked at naturally as probable but then spiritually as absolutely true proverbs 23 17 let's not thine heart and be sinners but be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long so this is just an encouraging Scripture we've got to keep this up all day long we've got to honor God fear God depart from evil all day long and that is I'm sure you're burdened I'm sure that's my burden as well we got to keep this going all day every day and we can do it by the grace of the Lord now proverbs 24 21 says my son fear thou the Lord and the king and meddle not with them that are given to charge so this is about respecting those in authority and so this shows were to fear God and the king so this is what brother Ram taught a lot in the message respects he said when you respect God I'll show when you fear God then you have respect for other people so in other words if we start with fear for God it will naturally flow out to everybody else and so that's a beautiful promise there by the grace of the Lord and like this last one proverbs 31:30 this is I'll probably preach on the next time when we look at the proverbs 31 woman says favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that fear the Lord she shall be praised so at the very end of this poem about this valuable gifted woman here we know as the proverbs 31 woman it all boils down to the fact that she feared the Lord and will actually see there's two things that really amount to her success number one is she feared the Lord second she did her husband good all the days of his life so a woman really has those two main motivations in her life and if she can do that if she can fear the Lord first a subpoena of wisdom and then do good to her husband all the days of her life she'll be praised so God will honor her no doubt her family will honor her should probably see the honor on this side but without a doubt she'll receive honor on the other side well let me bring this down to a close here they bring it down to close by the grace of the Lord that's most of this they're about the fear of the Lord in Proverbs now recall Ecclesiastes 12 verse 13 and 14 let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his commands for this is the whole duty of man for God shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil so the conclusion of Solomon's searching in the cleese EOS T's is that men should fear the Lord that's the whole conclusion and I just want to say as I studied the scriptures and listen to the message respects from brother Branham I believe the fear of the Lord is still the whole conclusion of the matter so let me give a few New Testament examples to prove that the thief on the cross the one that was saved looked at the thief thief who is cursing Jesus and said don't you fear God so that means the saved thief did fear God and was saved so this shows the importance of the fear of the Lord it is still the conclusion of the matter instead of blaspheming God in the day of our judgment or when we should humble ourselves and realize that God is innocent God is holy God is just and we should fear the Lord so there's an example of the thief being saved because he feared God he feared Christ Ephesians 5:21 submit to one another in the fear of God so that's that's what we need today in the church our church every church needs that instead of fusses in the church we should just submit to one another because we fear God because we honor God respect God and then we should humble ourselves in the Fellowship of the saints 2nd corinthians 7 verse 1 we should perfect holiness in the fear of the Lord so that's a see a work of continual sanctification what is our our motivation behind perfecting holiness and being cleansed from all filthiness the motivation is the fear of the Lord we honor God we respect God you want to please the Lord I think I'll just jump to the last one rod I got two more in Revelation 14 6 through 7 the angel with the everlasting gospel said to fear God and give Him glory right before the mark of the beast is laid down now there's different thoughts about this angel I think brother Branham said it was Martin Luther but we know along with other scriptures scriptures the fear that God is so important so it's the last call before the mark of the beast and says fear God give him glory so when we fear God we'll more freely worship the Lord and give him praise with our lips and course in church service and everything on the last one I thought this is what was really powerful yesterday when I was listening to respects 1961 from brother Branham brother Ram says this he says and that because God is God he deserves respect that's right and he we've got to respect him and give a fear to him and that brings respect God has demanded that for himself and for all the servants God demands respects for his servants he is servants how we know that there are servants because he vindicates these servants by his word he takes these servants and makes them servants of God and proves that they are servants by making his word work through them servants then as you respect that servant you respect God so when I respect you and you respect me we respect each other then we're respecting God here's what he ties the scripture into respecting God and his servants the RAM says in paragraph 54 respects did not Jesus say in so much as you have done unto the least of these my little ones you have done it unto me so that just really struck my heart of course that's from Matthew 25 verse 40 where Jesus grants eternal life to the foolish virgin these people who were surprised to be saved and brother Branham said that because they had respects because they had the fear of God and respects God granted them eternal life and that's powerful because that ties in again with the thief on the cross he feared God God saved him and here at the white throne judgment God saves the foolish virgin that are as sheep on his right hand side because they feared God and because they feared God they did good to jesus's brethren although they didn't realize those were Jesus's brethren or they didn't realize it was Jesus in them that's necessarily so brother Graham said it was respects that caused these ones that are saved to do good to the least of Jesus's brother so I think I'll stop right there by the grace of the Lord and trust that was a blessing to you it was a real blessing to me and I'll just close in prayer and ask God to help us depart from evil and walk in the fear of the Lord all the days of our life father God and heaven we thank you Lord for your mercy and grace we just thank you for this scripture thank you that the fear of the Lord is a fountain Lord and it flows into this tree of life this wisdom that gives it life Lord God help us Lord each and every day to depart from evil lord help us Lord God to fear you god help us to cry out for understanding help us to seek you as silver and gold and then we'll understand the fear of the Lord the Father bless your people tonight Lord thank you for their patience lure with the Bible study and not having church on Sunday and today physically and just guide us by the Holy Spirit may we be a tentative to your voice may we spend more time with you Lord to understand your fear and to gain your wisdom we love you Lord Jesus in Christ's name we pray amen god bless you just email me or text me if you have any questions about the fear of the Lord my lord bless you I wonderful night
