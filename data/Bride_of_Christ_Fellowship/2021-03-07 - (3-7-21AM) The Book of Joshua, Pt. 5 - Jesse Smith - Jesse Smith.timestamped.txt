[38:54] inheritance
[38:55] the land which i swear unto their
[38:58] fathers
[38:59] to give them amen let's go to
[39:01] ecclesiastes 12 verse 1.
[39:07] in the text brother bang said this
[39:08] scripture reminded him of these little
[39:10] bible studies we've been doing with the
[39:11] children
[39:12] uh very very uh
[39:16] necessary scripture important scripture
[39:19] so we're thankful for god's grace
[39:23] [Applause]
[39:26] please ask 12 verse 1.
[39:31] before we read this i want to tell the
[39:33] the youth thank you for remembering the
[39:35] lord
[39:36] thus far praise god may you always
[39:39] remember the lord amen
[39:40] in your youth you will be so happy you
[39:43] will rejoice you will
[39:45] praise god um i just
[39:49] admire you know our children as i've
[39:50] said before they lived uh
[39:53] already living a higher life than i
[39:54] lived when i was at age way way way and
[39:57] way higher
[39:59] them being saved and sanctified some of
[40:01] them claiming to have the baptism of the
[40:02] holy ghost that's
[40:04] it's light years beyond me so i thank
[40:07] the lord for that
[40:08] but may you always remember youth may
[40:10] you always remember your creator
[40:13] and it will be well with you
[40:16] ecclesiastes 12 verse 1.
[40:18] let's just read that verse one together
[40:20] on three one two
[40:22] three remember now thy creator
[40:25] in the days of thy youth while the evil
[40:28] days come not
[40:29] nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt
[40:32] say
[40:33] i have no pleasure in them
[40:37] you know there's people like uh you know
[40:39] children there's people like my dad he
[40:41] doesn't have pleasure in life
[40:42] you know uh now i hope his testimony
[40:45] will change since i've spoken to him
[40:47] oh that's right in fact betsy told me
[40:48] last time that uh he has he's a total
[40:51] new outlook on life he's like he's happy
[40:53] remember that when emma was here
[40:55] did they say uh he's got a totally
[40:57] different outlook on life but
[40:58] for many years he said he doesn't even
[41:00] enjoy living
[41:01] so just something to keep in mind but
[41:03] remember if you serve the lord the bible
[41:04] says the joy of the lord is your
[41:06] strength
[41:07] amen praise god and that joy is a fruit
[41:10] of the holy spirit

[42:38] as you're being seated praise god
[42:50] so i do have some quotes i want to share
[42:52] i'm going to start with a little
[42:54] meme that i found it's a good one well
[42:56] mostly good
[42:58] um i guess i think i'd change the words
[43:00] a little bit
[43:01] so i found this on youtube a few weeks
[43:03] ago
[43:04] and it says he looks like a warrior
[43:06] looks like joshua i think in my mind you
[43:08] know he might look like a joshua
[43:10] maybe i can zoom in there so
[43:13] he's got a great big army before him but
[43:14] he's standing there like a soldier
[43:16] i like this like failure is not an
[43:18] option
[43:19] i will not survive and hopefully youtube
[43:21] doesn't kick me off the youtube for
[43:23] showing this
[43:24] right like i did last time i will not
[43:27] just survive
[43:28] freedom is near i choose to thrive so
[43:30] it's a little rhyming poem here
[43:32] i will live for full force now i would
[43:35] say always on my knees as far as prayer
[43:37] right
[43:38] so i might change some of this i will
[43:40] smash the door if i can't find the keys
[43:42] but
[43:43] i might change that too because jesus is
[43:45] the door praise god
[43:47] and jesus gave us the keys of the
[43:48] kingdom i just like this uh
[43:51] illustration as soldiers and the fact
[43:54] that we don't have to live life
[43:55] afraid praise god we have to live life
[43:58] uh
[43:58] wondering you know what's gonna happen
[44:00] we have to worry about tomorrow
[44:02] the bible says it's already got enough
[44:04] sufficient evil of its of of itself
[44:06] we got to worry about today praise god
[44:09] we've got to overcome just today amen
[44:11] we got to be conquerors just today
[44:14] praise god and that's what we want to do
[44:15] by god's grace so let's look to the word
[44:17] of god here we're looking at i think
[44:18] it's part five
[44:20] and we'll try to preach god's word and
[44:23] uh and trust
[44:24] the holy spirit will meet every need
[44:26] here today i'm gonna have a need today
[44:28] praise god
[44:29] and the lord can meet that need through
[44:31] the word
[44:32] we're trusting him to do it
[44:35] i'm just looking if there's anything
[44:36] else i forgot here
[44:38] um i mentioned on wednesday that brother
[44:40] ben narad he kind of gave me a little
[44:42] opportunity to preach online so
[44:44] he has a he has a new youtube channel
[44:46] and so i preach for him 25 minutes on
[44:48] thursday night so it's just a little
[44:50] video on there i just preached on the
[44:51] three works of grace so
[44:52] i mentioned that i just want to follow
[44:54] up on that uh he's really going all in
[44:56] on the
[44:57] online stuff trying to evangelize so
[44:59] he's preaching at cams this morning by
[45:01] the way and
[45:02] he sends his greetings uh but anyways i
[45:04] like i like what he's doing he's just
[45:05] trying to get the word out
[45:07] um you know and i think that's an
[45:09] admiral thing to do
[45:10] like brother man said don't keep it to
[45:11] yourself right don't keep it to yourself
[45:14] share it with somebody amen if it's just
[45:16] a text if it's just a witnessing
[45:18] opportunity if you're just giving a book
[45:19] do something try brother said just try
[45:22] to get one soul saved
[45:23] amen try to get us all saved praise god
[45:25] i like that
[45:27] so let's look at part five here and i'm
[45:29] gonna skip past that because that was my
[45:30] notes leading into it i want to finish
[45:32] this
[45:32] idea here about only being strong and
[45:35] courageous
[45:36] we got through a few of those bless you
[45:38] and i want to keep going on this
[45:40] uh by god's grace so let me set a timer
[45:42] here
[45:44] i did wake up with a little bit of sore
[45:46] throat so just would you pray for me
[45:47] they gotta
[45:48] help me i gargle some salt water i think
[45:50] i swallowed way too much though
[45:52] i was i had quite a salty drink this
[45:55] morning a couple times there so
[45:56] if you just pray for me that god will
[45:58] strengthen me i don't i don't really
[45:59] don't want to get sick
[46:01] so uh let's let's remember this here you
[46:02] know remember there's three steps to
[46:04] strength
[46:05] uh it's first it's first relinquishing
[46:08] all your strength
[46:09] it's first saying god i have no strength
[46:13] right we all wanna the world tells you
[46:14] be strong and have a self
[46:16] uh have self esteem right that's that's
[46:19] what when i was growing up in the thing
[46:20] i don't know about you but i had all
[46:21] these classes about self-esteem you need
[46:22] to
[46:23] feel good about yourself and you're
[46:25] talented and you're strong and you
[46:27] all that you're smart and all these it
[46:28] was all self-esteem right that's what i
[46:31] had growing up i remember that we had
[46:32] all kinds of pictures and
[46:33] uh papers to color and things to cut out
[46:36] and
[46:36] it was all about building self but when
[46:39] we come to god it's
[46:41] exactly the opposite it's saying i have
[46:43] no strength
[46:44] but i can use your strength amen
[46:47] it's not it's not remembering anything
[46:49] good about me because there's nothing
[46:51] good about me amen
[46:53] it's about trusting in the goodness of
[46:54] god it's
[46:56] it's taking his strength and using his
[46:58] power
[46:59] using his word praise god that's the
[47:01] first step is
[47:02] realizing you and i have no strength and
[47:04] then we remember that god is
[47:06] always with us god is faithful he'll
[47:08] never leave us
[47:10] nor forsake us i'm glad it's written in
[47:11] both places amen
[47:13] because you might have had a hard time
[47:14] convincing me well brother just you're
[47:15] like joshua
[47:16] you might have had a hard time
[47:18] convincing me but when hebrews says
[47:20] i'll never leave you or i'll never
[47:22] forsake you amen
[47:24] and that gives me courage that god's
[47:25] with me today praise god
[47:27] just like he is joshua amen amen
[47:31] you know but we're very thankful but god
[47:34] gives us that promise he repeats it in
[47:36] the new testament
[47:37] see how he's the same yesterday today
[47:39] and forever
[47:40] amen thank god amen hallelujah
[47:44] and church we've just got to keep the
[47:45] commands of god we just got to obey
[47:47] and as we obey we constantly speak god's
[47:50] word we
[47:51] meditate on it whether it's through
[47:53] praising god like we did it in our
[47:54] worship today
[47:55] amen that's part of it water in the seed
[47:57] right water in the camel
[47:59] through your praise you've got to praise
[48:01] god and give thanks and everything
[48:03] and we've got to have a prayer life
[48:05] constantly talking to god
[48:06] amen and that through these through
[48:09] these methods
[48:10] we build our strength praise god we
[48:12] become stronger
[48:13] because remember the enemy keeps coming
[48:15] in like a flood praise god
[48:17] uh for a while you'll have it pretty
[48:18] good right but then there'll come a
[48:19] season when you feel overwhelmed and the
[48:21] church said
[48:23] never felt overwhelmed well i feel like
[48:25] it's a flood it's like a flood-like
[48:27] situation
[48:28] remember god raises up a standard in
[48:30] other words he raises up a banner
[48:32] against that
[48:33] in other words he said i'm coming with
[48:34] power to combat that
[48:36] amen even though it comes in like a
[48:38] flood there's going to be an
[48:40] army raise up amen that's going to be
[48:42] able to overcome the flood
[48:44] of challenges that come against us let
[48:47] us be encouraged amen in other words
[48:49] god promised to send an angel army to
[48:51] protect us amen
[48:52] hallelujah if we'll just call on his
[48:55] name and believe it amen
[48:57] hallelujah we've seen it over and over
[48:59] when enemy comes in like a flood god
[49:00] sends an army god sends strength
[49:03] god sends victory if we only call upon
[49:05] the lord amen
[49:06] we don't feel sorry for ourself we don't
[49:08] pity ourselves right
[49:09] but we we are strong in the lord and we
[49:12] speak the word and go forward amen
[49:14] now here's where we left off kind of
[49:15] left off on this i want to dig in this
[49:17] scripture a little bit more
[49:19] uh by god's grace because i saw how it
[49:21] uh kind of connected this morning
[49:23] he says this as you've received christ
[49:26] jesus the lord
[49:27] walk in him
[49:30] rooted and built up in him and remember
[49:33] we saw
[49:33] last week you're going both ways right
[49:36] uh our roots go down into the soil
[49:39] right but we're also growing up as a
[49:42] manifestation
[49:43] that we are a plant of god we're a tree
[49:47] of god remember i read that this week
[49:48] how jesus healed that blind man and
[49:50] jesus spit on his hands or spit on the
[49:52] dirt and rubbed his eyes and
[49:54] he said what do you see he said i see
[49:56] trees walking amen
[49:58] i think he did it again i think he spit
[49:59] again and rubbed it again he said now
[50:01] what do you see he said i see man amen
[50:03] i see him perfectly but he kind of got
[50:06] this
[50:07] initial he kind of got the spiritual
[50:09] view of mankind right
[50:10] the way god sees it we're all plants
[50:13] praise god
[50:14] and we're the wheat seed of god we're
[50:15] the children of god amen
[50:18] we're the trees of god we're the uh uh
[50:20] we're the field of the law of the lord
[50:22] amen we're the lord's harvest amen and
[50:26] so we're
[50:26] our roots go down deeper and we get
[50:29] built up and grow stronger
[50:31] and we we we're enlarged into heavenly
[50:34] places we're raised up
[50:36] we grow up into him as well we grow we
[50:38] grow down into him we get stable in him
[50:41] and we grow up into him as well
[50:44] glory and he said you were established
[50:46] in the faith as we've been taught
[50:48] abounding therein
[50:49] with thanksgiving praise god man
[50:52] always giving god thanks beware lest any
[50:55] man spoil you through philosophy
[50:58] and vain deceit so philosophy of course
[51:01] is the love of wisdom right
[51:02] but that's man's wisdom so we got to be
[51:05] careful we don't mix
[51:06] philosophy like this happened in the
[51:08] message a few years ago
[51:10] what was it they called it uh focus on
[51:13] the family so
[51:14] there's a couple preachers that have now
[51:15] fallen away from the message
[51:17] and and some preachers were taking some
[51:20] some teachings from focus on the family
[51:22] on how to raise their families and their
[51:24] families were torn apart
[51:26] and they've left the message and now
[51:28] focus on the family does sometimes do
[51:30] do good stuff right they do good stuff
[51:33] sometimes
[51:33] but the idea was they were taking fallot
[51:35] the preachers were taking philosophies
[51:38] that broke the word and one of them was
[51:40] oh it's okay let your children listen to
[51:42] rock and roll
[51:43] but brother ram said throw that trash
[51:45] out of the house
[51:47] even if you got to fight and argue this
[51:49] is what my mom used to
[51:50] you know we had like rock and roll she
[51:52] would like literally wrestle with us to
[51:54] try to get a
[51:55] you know we'd hold it like this like try
[51:57] to keep it away from our moms you know
[51:59] but pretty soon when we go to sleep
[52:00] she'd find a brother vegan and she'd
[52:01] throw it away
[52:03] she'd hide it you know but you know
[52:05] preachers in the message
[52:06] they've taken philosophy like well it's
[52:08] okay let them you know
[52:10] let them do the uh the evil things it's
[52:12] okay let them do a little bit
[52:13] but the bible says keep all the trash
[52:15] out of your house amen
[52:17] the bible says separate yourself from
[52:18] all unbelief amen
[52:20] and so the preachers that brought in
[52:22] this philosophy
[52:24] they corrupted their churches and their
[52:26] families and now they're paying the
[52:27] price of it
[52:29] right now vain deceit after the
[52:31] traditions of men so they took the
[52:33] traditions of
[52:34] of doctrines right instead of the holy
[52:37] spirit
[52:38] and instead of god's prophet amen right
[52:41] instead of uh after the rudiments of the
[52:44] world and not after
[52:46] christ okay so in other words if we want
[52:48] to keep growing deeper in christ and
[52:50] growing up into christ we can't take
[52:52] anything above the word boy it's so
[52:54] simple mine
[52:55] i tell you on the day of judgment it's
[52:56] going to be so simple it was all about
[52:58] just hearing the word
[53:00] obeying the word believing the word amen
[53:03] just stay with the word amen it's just
[53:06] that simple
[53:08] i mean if we want to grow and if we want
[53:09] to get deeper in love with god
[53:11] it's just so simple just stick with just
[53:13] the word amen
[53:15] praise god just stay with the word only
[53:18] praise god don't mix philosophy
[53:20] don't mix traditions of men don't mix
[53:22] any of these things in there
[53:23] just stay with the word oh it's so
[53:26] simple what a
[53:27] my what a witness it'll be on the day of
[53:29] judgment
[53:31] but now he talked about roots now jesus
[53:35] and this this morning i was reminded
[53:37] jesus spoke of roots so what was rooted
[53:40] jesus said he that received the seed in
[53:42] stony place is the same as he that
[53:43] heareth the word
[53:44] and anon with joy receiveth it
[53:47] yet he hath no root not root in himself
[53:52] so there's got to be if you want to be a
[53:54] real genuine plant of god
[53:55] you've got to have good soil in your
[53:58] heart
[53:59] you can't have a stony heart right
[54:02] because there was there's the wayside
[54:04] which was off the beaten path
[54:06] and there was a seed that fell there
[54:07] there was four spots remember
[54:09] and then the the path this is the second
[54:11] path this is the stony path where you
[54:13] walk on
[54:14] right like our driveway's made it's got
[54:16] stones everywhere
[54:17] and we see plants grow weeds grow up in
[54:19] there every year right then they die
[54:21] right but jesus says this kind of the
[54:24] word
[54:25] fell on a stony ground and it had no
[54:28] root in itself
[54:29] right in other words it was not able to
[54:31] take root in good soil
[54:34] and it lasted for a while and jesus says
[54:37] in
[54:37] luke he said they believe for a while
[54:41] but when tribulation or persecution
[54:43] arises because of the world
[54:45] he's offended so in other words whenever
[54:48] the devil comes like this they give up
[54:50] instead of getting stronger in the lord
[54:52] amen hallelujah
[54:54] so instead of running into the battle
[54:56] they run away from the battle and
[54:58] they're cowards
[54:59] but we're not to run away from the
[55:00] battle we're to go right into it praise
[55:02] god
[55:03] amen they can believe for a while when
[55:06] there's no battle around when there's no
[55:08] demons around well who
[55:09] anybody can do that anybody can rejoice
[55:13] and shout and be happy and
[55:15] glory and cry when there's no devil
[55:17] around but let the devil come around
[55:20] then we'll see what you're made of amen
[55:23] i like that i like what the scripture
[55:26] says there
[55:28] anybody can believe for a while so in
[55:31] other words we got to remember
[55:32] tribulations coming persecution's coming
[55:37] offenses are coming in other words
[55:41] people are going to offend us right
[55:42] and offend the word but we've got to be
[55:45] ready to be stable
[55:47] and not let that overturn our hearts and
[55:50] our attitudes towards the word
[55:53] amen
[55:56] so being rooted means loving
[55:59] christ the word or truth
[56:03] so the bible said they had no root in
[56:05] other words they didn't have no soil
[56:07] the soil is the love of god is a heart
[56:10] that loves god amen
[56:14] that christ may dwell in your hearts by
[56:16] faith that ye
[56:17] being rooted and grounded in love
[56:21] amen remember there's four kind of
[56:23] hearts right two of them
[56:24] the two there don't even have any love
[56:26] for god
[56:28] any real love for god right the wayside
[56:31] then nothing
[56:32] the stones not really love for god just
[56:34] joy they like the feeling of the lord
[56:37] which we all do but then the next two
[56:40] they do have love for god
[56:42] right and so the seed of god can begin
[56:46] to grow
[56:47] in their hearts and lives because they
[56:49] do have some love for god
[56:50] church foolish version the ones that are
[56:52] real virgins they got real love for god
[56:56] they love god but the thing is they
[56:59] start loving the things of the world do
[57:02] in other words we can't get too
[57:04] comfortable on this earth
[57:06] amen praise god don't get too
[57:09] comfortable
[57:10] and church many times god will send
[57:11] trials our way just to keep us
[57:13] uncomfortable and keep us longing for
[57:16] heaven praise god
[57:18] amen like a money disaster right or
[57:21] unexpected money expense that'll make
[57:23] you long for heaven
[57:25] a death in the family that'll make you
[57:26] long for heaven
[57:28] or a friend that dies or passes away
[57:30] that'll make you long for heaven
[57:32] right so i thank the lord that he puts
[57:35] all these things into our lives
[57:36] to remind us that this is not our final
[57:39] destination
[57:40] amen the sin soaked world i'm talking
[57:42] about amen
[57:43] but there's gonna come a kingdom the
[57:45] kingdom of the lord jesus amen
[57:47] that's the kingdom that's coming so
[57:51] being
[57:51] rooted means you're the seed of god is
[57:54] planted in your heart of love
[57:58] because remember the bible said the
[58:00] antichrist pope oh did you see this week
[58:02] he went to iraq what a what is what a
[58:06] statement that is
[58:10] the head of spiritual babylon went back
[58:13] to natural babylon for the first time
[58:16] ever
[58:17] that's the first time think about that
[58:20] the king of spiritual babylon
[58:22] goes back to his original roots and
[58:25] what's his message
[58:26] we're all one if that ain't the lie from
[58:29] hell
[58:30] right he met with all these muslim
[58:31] leaders and they're all talking about
[58:32] peace
[58:33] and the people say oh we've got hope we
[58:35] finally got hope after all the isis
[58:36] stuff
[58:38] yet the bible says that the the blood of
[58:40] all people
[58:42] will be the responsibility for all the
[58:44] blood is upon the catholic church
[58:49] so the pope's going there to say sorry
[58:50] about all the isis people but in reality
[58:52] the catholic church was behind the isis
[58:56] every murder goes back to the catholic
[58:58] church and i feel my voice i just can't
[59:00] go really high so forget it
[59:01] it's a little sore today but i don't
[59:05] know if you saw that this week he's
[59:06] spending
[59:06] i think he's there today having mass uh
[59:10] and then i said like this he's having a
[59:12] massacre there can i say like that
[59:14] he's having a massacre there a massacre
[59:17] of destroying the word
[59:18] and then he's heading back tomorrow to
[59:20] italy what a thing
[59:22] what a what a sign
[59:25] but now the pope he deceives them by
[59:29] letting them live
[59:29] unrighteous lives in those that perish
[59:33] because they receive not the love of the
[59:36] truth
[59:37] see that they might be saved so jesus or
[59:40] paul says
[59:40] you and i have have uh our faith is
[59:43] rooted and grounded in love
[59:46] in other words we have hearts of love
[59:47] for the word but the pope
[59:49] and his people do not they never receive
[59:52] the love for the truth
[59:54] in other words their hearts are stony
[59:55] hearts praise god
[59:57] the muslim hearts are stony hearts and
[1:00:00] it's going to take
[1:00:01] faith it's going to take love of god to
[1:00:03] give them a new heart it's going to take
[1:00:05] a miracle amen
[1:00:07] to give them a new heart
[1:00:11] so what the scripture says now remember
[1:00:13] faith works by
[1:00:14] love you have to start with love if
[1:00:16] we're ever going to have genuine faith
[1:00:18] we've got to start with loving jesus
[1:00:20] amen loving the word
[1:00:22] loving all that he taught all that he
[1:00:24] did we've got to love
[1:00:25] all of jesus amen see when we were saved
[1:00:28] we fell in love with the truth because
[1:00:30] jesus
[1:00:30] is the truth right amen and jesus so
[1:00:34] jesus said being rooted
[1:00:36] was an honest understanding patient
[1:00:40] and obedient heart now look at this
[1:00:44] church
[1:00:46] honesty will produce longevity
[1:00:50] in other words that that stony heart
[1:00:52] didn't last long because it wasn't
[1:00:54] really honest
[1:00:55] right because jesus says a good ground
[1:00:59] is the one that hears the word and
[1:01:02] understands it
[1:01:03] okay that's what that scripture means
[1:01:05] okay the bible doesn't contradict
[1:01:07] himself god does
[1:01:08] god is love and all these all these
[1:01:11] things we know
[1:01:12] and then it will bear fruit and bring
[1:01:14] forth some 100
[1:01:15] 60 30. praise god
[1:01:20] but remember the two kinds of seeds that
[1:01:22] the wayside the stony
[1:01:24] they didn't have longevity they didn't
[1:01:26] last very long
[1:01:27] because they were honest with god right
[1:01:31] they didn't really love the truth right
[1:01:34] but church you and i we've got to be
[1:01:36] honest with god
[1:01:38] and honest with our fellow man brother
[1:01:39] ramsay the way you know you love god
[1:01:41] is because you love each other amen
[1:01:44] praise god
[1:01:45] that's how we know so we got to be
[1:01:47] honest with each other
[1:01:49] that's the way we know we have good
[1:01:51] hearts
[1:01:53] hallelujah praise god now here's the
[1:01:55] scriptures
[1:01:58] now returning to this now the
[1:02:00] make-believer judas didn't have the soil
[1:02:03] right of true love for the truth in his
[1:02:06] heart
[1:02:07] how do you know because he secretly
[1:02:09] betrayed christ it was deceptive it
[1:02:10] wasn't truthful like he wasn't telling
[1:02:12] the truth right
[1:02:14] he hid the truth in other words he knew
[1:02:17] this whole time he loved money
[1:02:18] he loved all these things but he hid it
[1:02:20] from the brothers now i'm not telling
[1:02:22] all of you to tell your deepest battle
[1:02:23] to
[1:02:23] each other but sometimes it is good to
[1:02:25] confess your faults one to another
[1:02:27] right i'm not saying you got to tell
[1:02:30] everybody that
[1:02:31] i don't want to know vang and amens and
[1:02:33] jose's i don't want to jose i don't know
[1:02:34] all the details of i don't want to know
[1:02:36] all the details
[1:02:36] but if you can say brother jesse just
[1:02:38] pray for me i'm struggling or if i could
[1:02:39] i told amen remember brother amen
[1:02:41] could you pray for me i was battling a
[1:02:42] certain thing remember that
[1:02:44] that's because we get that's just
[1:02:45] because we get to talk more brother bang
[1:02:46] i'll tell you later jose i'll tell you
[1:02:48] later
[1:02:49] there's just certain times i go through
[1:02:51] seasons you know of different battles
[1:02:53] right
[1:02:55] but you know uh judas never admitted
[1:02:57] that
[1:02:59] you know it the bible said jesus knew
[1:03:01] his heart
[1:03:02] and said you don't care about the money
[1:03:04] remember when the woman was washing his
[1:03:05] feet
[1:03:05] he said you don't care about the money
[1:03:07] he said preacher's going to preach about
[1:03:08] this woman
[1:03:09] all around the world amen she did such a
[1:03:11] good act to me he said you don't care
[1:03:12] about the money
[1:03:13] i'm sorry you don't care about the money
[1:03:15] and giving it to the poor you
[1:03:16] love the you love the money right so he
[1:03:19] was deceiving
[1:03:20] others church let's not act any way when
[1:03:22] we come to church
[1:03:23] let's be honest when we come to church
[1:03:25] amen
[1:03:27] that's how you grow in strength before
[1:03:29] we're ever going to be strong we got to
[1:03:30] be honest with god amen
[1:03:32] we got to be honest with each other
[1:03:34] because when it came down for judas to
[1:03:36] resist satan could he do it
[1:03:38] no he he gave in to satan
[1:03:41] because he wasn't honest can you imagine
[1:03:45] three and a half years of miracles
[1:03:46] brother bang and he was he never
[1:03:48] got to the point where he went to jesus
[1:03:50] brother this is all you had to do
[1:03:51] brother he
[1:03:52] can you imagine this he just had to go
[1:03:53] to jesus after the prayer line say jesus
[1:03:55] can you forgive me of loving money
[1:03:57] that's all he had to do
[1:03:58] he just had to go to his pastor after
[1:04:00] everybody went through he said to go
[1:04:02] pastor can you forgive me of my love for
[1:04:04] money i just want to overcome this
[1:04:05] but he wasn't honest he was hearing the
[1:04:09] preaching and it tickled his ears you
[1:04:10] know
[1:04:11] he wasn't honest may god help us to be
[1:04:13] honest today amen
[1:04:15] that's a good heart again i don't need
[1:04:18] to know all the details of your problems
[1:04:20] that's not what i'm saying i think
[1:04:21] sometimes that hurts more than helps
[1:04:23] but just general you know i need to
[1:04:25] confess this to somebody
[1:04:27] i got to get this off my heart see
[1:04:30] there's a certain blessing to this
[1:04:32] to being an honest heart because the
[1:04:35] bible says
[1:04:36] there he had no root in himself he hung
[1:04:39] around for a while
[1:04:40] but he didn't have an honest and good
[1:04:42] heart see that
[1:04:45] here's where he says it but they that on
[1:04:48] the good ground or they which have a
[1:04:49] honest and good heart
[1:04:51] having heard the word i like this they
[1:04:52] keep the word
[1:04:54] man i wonder how many times jesus said
[1:04:55] thou shalt not steal and judas was like
[1:04:58] yeah right
[1:04:59] whatever right because he was eventually
[1:05:01] going to steal right he's actually going
[1:05:02] to take the money
[1:05:04] he was going to take the money and
[1:05:05] deceive christ
[1:05:07] he heard the word but he didn't keep the
[1:05:09] word that's why church
[1:05:10] every service is so important for you to
[1:05:12] keep your heart pure before god
[1:05:16] because we've all seen it we've all seen
[1:05:17] people hang around for years
[1:05:20] and then they can they're no longer
[1:05:22] strong enough how could you not be
[1:05:23] strong enough after years
[1:05:25] of hearing the word of jesus christ it's
[1:05:27] because
[1:05:28] the the ground the seed is good right
[1:05:31] the seed word is good
[1:05:32] but the ground's got to be
[1:05:35] are you good too they're let they let
[1:05:38] thorns grow up
[1:05:40] right they choke the word you can be so
[1:05:43] strong for so many years
[1:05:45] but if you start caring for the things
[1:05:47] of the world and pleasures and i skip
[1:05:50] this i skip my bible time there
[1:05:52] i'll skip my tithes there i'll skip
[1:05:54] going to church just
[1:05:55] just just little pleasures right oh my
[1:05:59] beatrice is like yeah she's seen it
[1:06:02] right we've all seen it they can seem so
[1:06:05] strong
[1:06:06] and and that plant can seem to be strong
[1:06:08] for so long
[1:06:10] but if they let they make compromises
[1:06:12] things will start growing up and
[1:06:13] i'm not saying they're not saved they
[1:06:15] might be saved
[1:06:18] but the ground wasn't honest
[1:06:21] right it wasn't a honest heart
[1:06:25] it was a pain it wasn't a patient it
[1:06:27] wasn't an obedient heart
[1:06:31] does everybody understand by god's grace
[1:06:34] because if we don't get this church
[1:06:35] it don't matter don't matter how much
[1:06:37] preaching we hear if we don't have
[1:06:38] honesty in our hearts we're never going
[1:06:40] to be strong
[1:06:41] we're never going to be strong because
[1:06:43] you got to start with the heart amen
[1:06:45] you got to start with the soil amen it's
[1:06:48] got to be good
[1:06:49] soil amen those other two kinds didn't
[1:06:51] even have good they didn't have soil
[1:06:53] they just had stone and wayside right
[1:06:56] we got to start with a good honest and
[1:06:59] understanding heart
[1:07:05] telling the truth praise god so
[1:07:07] important so important
[1:07:08] how are you doing today brother sister
[1:07:10] we'll be struggling with saying i'm
[1:07:11] doing good
[1:07:13] i'm doing good and we're not doing good
[1:07:15] and we might be struggling
[1:07:16] as and i understand you want a good
[1:07:18] confession i understand that too
[1:07:22] but if we are if we're lying through our
[1:07:23] teeth then that's that's sinful
[1:07:27] right we say well i'm doing good by
[1:07:28] god's grace i'm just fighting the
[1:07:30] battles
[1:07:30] that's that's fine too but the thing is
[1:07:32] let's win the battle praise god
[1:07:35] let's raise up and let's be strong and
[1:07:37] very courageous amen
[1:07:40] in the things of god
[1:07:43] praise the lord so if we want church if
[1:07:46] we want
[1:07:47] victory if we want to be strong we've
[1:07:48] got to start with honesty
[1:07:51] what is our honest condition before god
[1:07:54] like i preached that message to brother
[1:07:55] uh at brother ben's uh live stream there
[1:07:57] on youtube and facebook
[1:07:59] and a brother emailed me the next day
[1:08:00] and said i loved it it was just what i
[1:08:02] needed
[1:08:03] he said because i prayed at the end i
[1:08:04] said may god show you where you are on
[1:08:06] your journey
[1:08:07] egypt wilderness promise land he said
[1:08:09] i'm in the wilderness there
[1:08:10] i'm just about ready to take the
[1:08:12] promised land i said praise the lord
[1:08:14] that was my prayer i said just be honest
[1:08:16] with god like you should be able to tell
[1:08:19] i just left egypt like i can still see
[1:08:21] the things of the world
[1:08:22] i can still see the world uh as part as
[1:08:25] kind of connected to my life
[1:08:27] or we can say out in the wilderness man
[1:08:29] it's hot out here it's difficult out
[1:08:31] here but thank god i don't see egypt
[1:08:32] anymore praise god
[1:08:34] amen i'm getting blessings i'm getting
[1:08:36] manna every day praise the lord thank
[1:08:38] god for the
[1:08:39] heavenly manna amen but i don't really
[1:08:42] own anything
[1:08:43] i know i haven't really possessed much
[1:08:46] amen hallelujah
[1:08:48] or we should be able to see i possess
[1:08:50] the promises of god
[1:08:52] and i not only possess them i'm living
[1:08:54] in them amen
[1:08:56] i'm planting fruits here i'm living in
[1:08:58] it and i'm enjoying it and i've got
[1:09:00] freedom
[1:09:01] i've got something that i owe i'm
[1:09:03] possessing i'm doing what god's called
[1:09:05] me to do
[1:09:06] i know exactly where i live i've got a
[1:09:08] permanent address amen
[1:09:10] hallelujah we need an address in the
[1:09:12] promised land amen
[1:09:15] we need a title deed can i say it like
[1:09:17] that
[1:09:18] we need a title deed in the promised
[1:09:21] land
[1:09:22] this is what god called me to do this is
[1:09:24] where god wants me praise god
[1:09:26] joshua told me to go there amen and i
[1:09:28] listen to god's prophet joshua amen
[1:09:31] amen hallelujah
[1:09:35] thank the lord church thank the lord
[1:09:38] we got to start with honesty because
[1:09:39] remember the cares and pleasures is
[1:09:41] what's going to make the difference
[1:09:42] between the wise and the foolish right
[1:09:45] the difference is going to be the
[1:09:47] foolish care about
[1:09:48] worldly things and pleasures that
[1:09:50] distract us
[1:09:52] from the truth so the word when it fell
[1:09:55] among
[1:09:56] thorns they heard the word
[1:09:59] and they go forth and are choked with
[1:10:02] the cares
[1:10:02] and riches and pleasures of this life
[1:10:05] and bring
[1:10:06] no fruit to completion
[1:10:09] or perfection now look their lives don't
[1:10:12] seem complete
[1:10:13] praise god how many know what i'm
[1:10:14] talking about you want you want to feel
[1:10:16] like
[1:10:16] i've accomplished what god wanted me to
[1:10:18] do how many want that feeling praise god
[1:10:20] that's what we want we want to feel like
[1:10:22] our lives has produced something that's
[1:10:25] that glorifies god amen we're going to
[1:10:28] feel like oh i didn't really achieve
[1:10:29] what
[1:10:30] i was supposed to be and the word got
[1:10:32] choked out and never really
[1:10:34] never really got to what i was supposed
[1:10:36] to be ah whether
[1:10:38] like my man said whether it's a holy
[1:10:39] ghost-filled farmer whether it's a holy
[1:10:41] ghost factory worker
[1:10:42] whether it's a holy ghost-filled
[1:10:44] housewife may god help us to understand
[1:10:46] what we've been called to be
[1:10:47] and bring forth the fruits of our lives
[1:10:50] amen
[1:10:51] the fruits of our ministry praise god
[1:10:56] i want to bring forth fruit as a teacher
[1:10:59] holy ghost fruit amen in that school
[1:11:01] praise god
[1:11:02] i'm going to bring holy ghost fruit in
[1:11:03] the factory for our brothers or in the
[1:11:05] landscaping job right
[1:11:08] you want to bring forth the fruit where
[1:11:09] they can see love and joy and peace and
[1:11:11] long-suffering and gentleness and
[1:11:12] goodness and kindness and
[1:11:14] all these they can see the fruits and
[1:11:16] they can benefit from those things
[1:11:19] praise god but if we let pleasures and
[1:11:23] we get too much interested in pleasures
[1:11:25] and cares of the world they won't find
[1:11:26] love they won't find gentleness
[1:11:29] right they'll find somebody that wants
[1:11:30] to bite their head off right
[1:11:33] where's all the patience brother where's
[1:11:35] all your patience sister
[1:11:38] see that's what we don't want praise god
[1:11:40] we don't want the foolish virgin
[1:11:41] we want a good heart praise god that's
[1:11:43] honest at all times
[1:11:46] and understands the word of god
[1:11:50] now church don't forget this now here
[1:11:51] the holy spirit is your strength let me
[1:11:53] know that
[1:11:54] amen now look what he says here now this
[1:11:56] was almost at that song whether amen was
[1:11:58] singing how deep how wide
[1:11:59] this is right in that portion that's a
[1:12:02] very good psalm
[1:12:03] we're named after the whole family
[1:12:05] heaven earth is named lord jesus christ
[1:12:07] that he would grant to you according to
[1:12:08] the riches of his glory
[1:12:10] to be strengthened with might by his
[1:12:13] spirit
[1:12:13] in the inner man so what's your inner
[1:12:17] man your mind and your soul
[1:12:20] so paul says god will grant it to you
[1:12:22] god will give you the strength amen
[1:12:24] god will give you his power in your mind
[1:12:27] and in your soul
[1:12:28] that's something he wants to grant unto
[1:12:31] you according to the richness of his
[1:12:33] love
[1:12:35] god wants to give you a strong mind amen
[1:12:38] god wants to give you a strong soul
[1:12:41] that's sealed through the day of
[1:12:42] redemption praise god
[1:12:44] paul says this power is inward working
[1:12:47] power
[1:12:48] it's in the inner man praise god
[1:12:51] amen in other words i don't know about
[1:12:54] you but i want to feel it i want to feel
[1:12:56] i want to feel the the i've had this
[1:12:59] before
[1:13:00] i want to feel the words come to me and
[1:13:02] i just know they're from heaven
[1:13:04] amen praise god where i want to feel i
[1:13:07] just want to see the words come out
[1:13:08] because it's it's not i wasn't even
[1:13:10] planning on saying it but the word just
[1:13:12] spoke
[1:13:12] praise god amen because it's the power
[1:13:16] in the inner man amen
[1:13:18] the power works from the inside amen
[1:13:22] praise god so this is where god paul
[1:13:26] says god strengthens you in the
[1:13:27] inside
[1:13:30] that christ may dwell in your hearts by
[1:13:32] faith
[1:13:33] revelation or assurance that you being
[1:13:36] rooted and grounded in love
[1:13:39] now here that's where he says that you
[1:13:40] might know the depths the heights of
[1:13:41] love and
[1:13:42] the breath of christ and to know the
[1:13:44] love because it surpasses knowledge
[1:13:47] that you might be filled with all the
[1:13:49] fullness of god
[1:13:51] paul wanted those ephesian saints there
[1:13:52] was 12 of them they got the holy ghost
[1:13:54] at one time ah
[1:13:56] what a service that was amen what 12 of
[1:13:59] them and what paul is telling them later
[1:14:01] i want you to be full with all of god's
[1:14:03] power amen
[1:14:04] on your body and your mind and your soul
[1:14:07] i want you to be filled with all that he
[1:14:09] can get to you amen
[1:14:11] like brother said he said i just he said
[1:14:13] i want the holy ghost from the top of my
[1:14:15] head down to the soles of my feet
[1:14:16] he said every fiber of my being amen
[1:14:20] every fiber is yielded to the holy
[1:14:23] spirit it's honest it's understanding
[1:14:25] it's good
[1:14:28] now i like this because he now unto him
[1:14:31] that's able to do
[1:14:32] exceedingly abundantly above all we ask
[1:14:36] or think
[1:14:37] according to the power which is love
[1:14:40] that works in us god is going to do how
[1:14:43] many
[1:14:44] how many have seen it god has done more
[1:14:46] than what you've asked him to do
[1:14:48] amen so god wants to fill you with all
[1:14:52] the fullness
[1:14:53] so that he'll be able to do above all
[1:14:56] that we ask or think
[1:14:59] according to the power that works in us
[1:15:03] amen so in other words god is going to
[1:15:06] use his power
[1:15:07] to work in you and he's going to flow
[1:15:10] through you
[1:15:11] praise god and he's going to do more
[1:15:13] than what you
[1:15:14] asked through you praise god amen
[1:15:20] hallelujah so i just want to lay that
[1:15:23] scripture down there because it's it's
[1:15:24] so
[1:15:25] uh beautiful there be filled with all
[1:15:27] the fullness of god
[1:15:29] like brother man said i don't want to
[1:15:30] dip with the holy spirit he said i want
[1:15:32] to i want
[1:15:33] i want a baptism of the holy spirit
[1:15:35] praise god i don't want to sprinkle the
[1:15:37] holy spirit
[1:15:38] immerse me in it praise god amen
[1:15:42] i might call it a holy roller i might as
[1:15:43] well praise god
[1:15:45] they've already kicked me out they've
[1:15:46] already called me crazy they've already
[1:15:48] called me a devil
[1:15:48] they've already called me all these
[1:15:50] things i might as well be full of it
[1:15:52] praise god full of the holy ghost and
[1:15:53] power amen
[1:15:55] oh yes glory
[1:15:59] now here's one thing here's one here's
[1:16:02] the way we
[1:16:03] we don't we don't often like to think of
[1:16:05] strength in this way
[1:16:07] we always like to think of strength
[1:16:09] speaking the word praying for somebody
[1:16:11] and uh there's america well that's maybe
[1:16:12] that's me
[1:16:14] right oh there's a miracle god just did
[1:16:16] a miracle that's strength
[1:16:17] but there's another form of strength
[1:16:20] that works in us
[1:16:21] and is able to do exceedingly abundantly
[1:16:23] above all we asked or thought
[1:16:27] and that's through that l word
[1:16:32] learning oh yeah we all get through high
[1:16:35] school right then we're done i'm done
[1:16:36] learning well if you're a christian you
[1:16:38] just started
[1:16:40] praise god you were wrong i couldn't
[1:16:42] wait till i got done with college too
[1:16:45] i couldn't wait oh my goodness now i got
[1:16:47] to go back next year i got to get six
[1:16:49] credit hours again
[1:16:50] i'm not looking forward to that but i
[1:16:53] want to grow in the things of god
[1:16:55] amen i want to learn from the holy
[1:16:58] spirit praise god
[1:17:00] that's what we've got to have we have
[1:17:02] the bible says
[1:17:04] here as you look at a few scriptures the
[1:17:06] way we gre
[1:17:07] stronger is by learning how to please
[1:17:10] god
[1:17:14] it's that l word right have we looked at
[1:17:17] this a few months ago
[1:17:18] not that i speak in respect of what of
[1:17:20] want for i've learned and whatsoever i
[1:17:22] state i am therewith
[1:17:23] to be content
[1:17:27] so paul he's a 50 some maybe 60 some
[1:17:29] year old man
[1:17:30] a couple years before his death he's
[1:17:32] saying i've recently learned
[1:17:34] no matter if i'm abounding or lacking if
[1:17:37] i got a lot or a little
[1:17:39] i've learned to be content
[1:17:42] that i can do all things through christ
[1:17:44] who strengthens me
[1:17:46] praise god
[1:17:49] it was a learning situation in order for
[1:17:52] him to get stronger
[1:17:55] he had to kick out some of his old
[1:17:56] previous thoughts in order to get
[1:17:58] stronger in the word
[1:18:00] right like one example is like
[1:18:04] my wife and i we never would have
[1:18:05] thought we could handle eight children
[1:18:07] but they just came like this brother
[1:18:08] bang so fast i mean
[1:18:11] i was thinking the other day i'm like
[1:18:12] how in the world did we get eight
[1:18:13] children you know what i mean
[1:18:15] like it just it just goes so fast right
[1:18:17] you just blink right and then
[1:18:19] they get older but like in our previous
[1:18:22] mind this is one area where i know i've
[1:18:24] grown
[1:18:25] you know god has shown me to be content
[1:18:26] no matter what state i'm in
[1:18:28] if god wants to send me more children i
[1:18:30] got to be more content in that praise
[1:18:31] god
[1:18:33] i don't want to rest i don't want to
[1:18:34] fight against the lord right
[1:18:36] right if god wants to make me richer
[1:18:39] that's easy to be content with that but
[1:18:41] if god wants to make me poor
[1:18:42] then we've got to learn to be content in
[1:18:44] that
[1:18:45] praise god he said no matter what state
[1:18:48] i'm in i've learned
[1:18:50] in other words god christ has given me
[1:18:52] strength
[1:18:54] to be content with whether i have a
[1:18:56] little or a lot
[1:19:00] i want to be strong brother jesse i want
[1:19:01] to be strong yes part of that strength
[1:19:03] is just being content in where god has
[1:19:05] you
[1:19:07] praise the lord because i know how to be
[1:19:09] a base he said
[1:19:11] humbled i know how to abound i know how
[1:19:13] to increase everywhere in all things
[1:19:15] i'm taught i'm instructed both to be
[1:19:17] full and hungry both to abound and to
[1:19:19] suffer need
[1:19:20] i can do all things through christ which
[1:19:22] strengtheneth me
[1:19:27] like as i was saying a few weeks ago you
[1:19:29] know our church kind of now is going
[1:19:30] through a quiet season right we'd say
[1:19:32] quiet
[1:19:33] thank god we don't have much battles
[1:19:34] going on right now like right now our
[1:19:36] ministry is in what being priests unto
[1:19:38] god praying for other people many times
[1:19:41] right like when was the last time you
[1:19:42] guys were sick i mean thank the lord
[1:19:43] right
[1:19:44] thank god you know we haven't been sick
[1:19:46] lately i thank the lord for that god
[1:19:47] healed brother jose thank the lord
[1:19:50] but sometimes churches go through
[1:19:51] difficult seasons
[1:19:53] you know they're just battling in other
[1:19:55] ways so that means
[1:19:57] that means that this lesson is for us
[1:19:59] right now right
[1:20:01] because we're learning we're supposed to
[1:20:02] be able to receive christ's strength
[1:20:04] to be content in the season that we're
[1:20:06] in right now praise god
[1:20:08] amen because in every season of life
[1:20:11] jesus is trying to give us strength to
[1:20:13] be content in that season
[1:20:16] hallelujah thank the lord
[1:20:21] in church you better believe me you
[1:20:22] better believe me when i say this it's
[1:20:24] i'm learning that
[1:20:24] praise god right my wife knows me
[1:20:28] my whole life since i've been been a
[1:20:29] christian i just want to go from miracle
[1:20:31] to miracle or a big thing to big thing
[1:20:33] and i just want to go from big major
[1:20:34] thing major thing
[1:20:36] but you know what the lord has to teach
[1:20:38] me to be strong
[1:20:39] and be content when things are not like
[1:20:42] that
[1:20:44] praise god i've got to learn to do that
[1:20:50] see but i can do that through his
[1:20:52] strength
[1:20:54] imagine just remember this pause
[1:20:57] receiving strength as he sits there and
[1:20:58] chains brother man
[1:21:00] he's chained up but yet he's learned the
[1:21:02] lesson and christ
[1:21:04] like i said that this christ is pouring
[1:21:05] his strength into paul's heart
[1:21:07] and he's just sitting there in chains
[1:21:08] he's writing letters or having somebody
[1:21:10] scribe the letters for him
[1:21:11] and he's just raising his hand saying
[1:21:12] hallelujah thank you jesus
[1:21:14] i'm i'm content where i am i'm content
[1:21:17] in prison
[1:21:18] and i feel the strength of god pouring
[1:21:20] on me
[1:21:23] there was a during the republican
[1:21:26] national convention this story just come
[1:21:27] to my mind
[1:21:28] there was a american journalist who was
[1:21:32] abducted forget which nation it was
[1:21:36] it might have been iran now she
[1:21:39] eventually passed away
[1:21:40] but she lived as a slave and she was
[1:21:42] abused and she was hurt
[1:21:44] she lived like that for years i think it
[1:21:45] was three or four years
[1:21:48] and in her final letters brother bang
[1:21:49] she was getting you know beaten and all
[1:21:51] kinds of
[1:21:51] things i can't even mention but in her
[1:21:54] final
[1:21:54] year or final days and weeks her letters
[1:21:57] were this
[1:21:58] her letters were that she learned to be
[1:22:01] content in the state that she was in and
[1:22:04] she
[1:22:04] she felt christ's power more
[1:22:07] than she'd ever felt before while in
[1:22:10] prison
[1:22:11] it was that l baghdadi guy remember when
[1:22:13] trump had him killed
[1:22:15] that guy was the one abusing this
[1:22:16] american journalist and yet her
[1:22:18] testimony was
[1:22:20] i know what paul felt like because
[1:22:23] when he was in prison the strength of
[1:22:25] christ came to him
[1:22:27] right and then when and so when she was
[1:22:29] in prison
[1:22:30] no i don't know where she falls why is
[1:22:32] her foolish i don't know where
[1:22:33] where she ended up i know we know she
[1:22:35] started out foolish at least she started
[1:22:36] out there as far as wearing pants and
[1:22:38] cutting her hair and everything like
[1:22:39] that
[1:22:39] makeup and everything like that but
[1:22:41] somehow jesus was faithful to her in the
[1:22:44] prison
[1:22:44] and before she died she quotes these
[1:22:46] words and she says i can do all things
[1:22:49] through christ who strengthens me his
[1:22:51] strength was made perfect in my weakness
[1:22:54] amen that's sobering church that's
[1:22:55] sobering
[1:22:57] an american journalist woman being
[1:22:59] beaten and abused daily
[1:23:00] or maybe on a weekly basis
[1:23:04] was able to say i know what that
[1:23:06] scripture means
[1:23:07] i'm able to receive his strength now
[1:23:09] which one of us will say she wasn't
[1:23:11] strong which one of us would say that
[1:23:12] i wouldn't say i would say if she could
[1:23:15] keep her testimony
[1:23:17] in the midst of that devil beating her
[1:23:19] right there i said she's got some good
[1:23:21] ground praise god
[1:23:22] she's got some good ground and so that
[1:23:25] means church
[1:23:26] in the battles that we go through we
[1:23:28] ought to be able to be more than
[1:23:29] conquerors in christ jesus
[1:23:32] no matter the condition we're in no
[1:23:34] matter the state that we're in we ought
[1:23:36] to say jesus
[1:23:37] give me your power amen i can do this
[1:23:39] help me through it praise god
[1:23:41] in fact i'll only get through it as you
[1:23:43] give me your strength praise god
[1:23:48] a beaten woman can do it in a prison in
[1:23:50] an iraqi prison
[1:23:52] then we can do it here in satan's eden
[1:23:55] praise god i know that's sober but
[1:23:58] that's the truth i'll
[1:23:59] fail to find that video the parents are
[1:24:01] up there weeping and reading it but
[1:24:02] that's
[1:24:02] that was their testimony that jesus
[1:24:04] christ strengthened their daughter as a
[1:24:06] prisoner for all those years three or
[1:24:08] four years
[1:24:11] and a young woman this was an old woman
[1:24:12] who had no life left i mean she was a
[1:24:13] young
[1:24:14] 20s and she still found the power
[1:24:17] oh can we say it like this jesus christ
[1:24:19] is real praise god
[1:24:21] amen amen there was no iraqi
[1:24:25] uh a soldier that could keep out the
[1:24:27] holy spirit out of that place
[1:24:29] hallelujah they could try to to keep him
[1:24:32] out but the love of god was so great it
[1:24:34] came down to the very depths of her
[1:24:36] trial
[1:24:37] and jesus poured out strength to her to
[1:24:39] be a conqueror even in the midst of
[1:24:41] slavery we'll say it like that prisoner
[1:24:44] slavery what a testimony
[1:24:51] now i pulled this up from my my series
[1:24:53] on wisdom you remember that it was right
[1:24:54] when brother william got here the first
[1:24:56] time
[1:24:56] i was preaching on wisdom in 2018.
[1:25:02] he kind of made me laugh uh i wasn't
[1:25:04] using many quotes from brother brown
[1:25:05] when i was preaching that
[1:25:06] and uh when once i started using more
[1:25:08] brother brahms quotes he said he said i
[1:25:09] didn't know if you
[1:25:10] believed in brother branham at first i
[1:25:13] said well brother i said
[1:25:15] i've been preaching up to that point
[1:25:16] about 15 years you know i just can't
[1:25:18] quote brother branham every service you
[1:25:19] know
[1:25:20] i kind of need a variety and i don't
[1:25:22] blame him
[1:25:24] uh but that's that's why i remember that
[1:25:26] because of this outline i remember
[1:25:27] brothers uh
[1:25:28] william say that to me bless bless his
[1:25:30] soul
[1:25:32] we sure love him but i come across the
[1:25:35] scripture this or
[1:25:36] actually that was it late last night
[1:25:37] this morning
[1:25:39] how many want to be strong a wise man
[1:25:43] is strong yeah a man of knowledge
[1:25:47] increases his strength
[1:25:52] a smart man knows how to go to the gym
[1:25:53] and get bigger muscles
[1:25:56] what kind of fool would we be to go to
[1:25:57] the gym and actually get weaker
[1:25:59] you know you could do that you could
[1:26:01] overwork and then not eat good and not
[1:26:03] sleep good
[1:26:04] and you could actually get weaker you
[1:26:06] got a balance the workouts with the
[1:26:08] right diet
[1:26:09] and the rest i remember it i don't
[1:26:11] remember it much anymore but i used to
[1:26:12] remember that i used to be up 190 pounds
[1:26:14] you know 30 pounds
[1:26:16] lighter than i uh heavier than i am now
[1:26:19] but the bible says if you're wise you
[1:26:21] know how to
[1:26:22] increase your strength in the word of
[1:26:24] god amen
[1:26:28] the bible says if you faint in the day
[1:26:30] of adversity can i get to that picture
[1:26:31] again
[1:26:34] if your hands go down instead of up the
[1:26:37] bible says then you're not strong right
[1:26:39] your strength is small well i just can't
[1:26:43] i just can't fight one more fight right
[1:26:45] i just can't do it one more time
[1:26:47] the bible says we don't want strong i'm
[1:26:50] sorry we don't want weakness
[1:26:51] we want to get stronger as time goes on
[1:26:54] right we want our knowledge and our
[1:26:55] wisdom to build us
[1:26:57] up to know yes there is a way i can
[1:26:59] overcome
[1:27:00] there is a way out of this temptation
[1:27:02] there is a way for me to overcome the
[1:27:04] enemy praise god
[1:27:06] i can get stronger i can be a better
[1:27:09] christian amen
[1:27:10] i can be more loving praise god i can be
[1:27:14] more wise
[1:27:15] there's a way to do it and that way is
[1:27:18] in the knowledge of his word amen
[1:27:19] amen
[1:27:23] so wise men are strong right
[1:27:27] like think of the wise versions the
[1:27:28] foolish comments said give it to us what
[1:27:30] were they they were strong and said no
[1:27:31] you've got to get it yourself
[1:27:33] they didn't give it over right okay oh
[1:27:35] yeah sure
[1:27:36] sure mr devil so-and-so you can have you
[1:27:38] could have my oil
[1:27:39] no they were strong and said you got to
[1:27:41] go get it yourself
[1:27:44] see a man increases his strength
[1:27:48] in church as we know as the rapture
[1:27:50] approaches we've got to increase our
[1:27:52] strength in the things of god
[1:27:54] right so again when you increase your
[1:27:57] understanding of god's word
[1:27:59] that produces more strength to defeat
[1:28:02] the adversary
[1:28:03] praise god yes
[1:28:07] let's remember this this was so
[1:28:08] important to me
[1:28:10] because if we say because if we say
[1:28:12] church we're the wise version we should
[1:28:13] get stronger
[1:28:14] we shouldn't get afraid of these times
[1:28:17] we should get stronger during these
[1:28:19] times
[1:28:20] chronovirus shook us all up i admit it
[1:28:21] you know of course i talked about that
[1:28:23] but see but only for a while right
[1:28:25] because pretty soon the strength returns
[1:28:27] amen
[1:28:28] right pretty soon you get stronger and
[1:28:30] you know the battle and you know it's
[1:28:32] you know what's coming
[1:28:33] and you're able to approach it and
[1:28:34] you're able to speak to that mountain
[1:28:36] amen
[1:28:37] you're able to speak to that enemy
[1:28:38] you're able to drive satan away in the
[1:28:40] name of the lord
[1:28:45] that's right how am i doing on time
[1:28:49] all right i'm almost done here by god's
[1:28:54] grace
[1:28:56] i think i'm almost done no he says
[1:29:00] now remember this is a great message on
[1:29:02] divine healing well that's the same way
[1:29:04] with preaching divine healing or
[1:29:05] anything else he's talking about
[1:29:06] learning to swim and learning to walk
[1:29:07] those two simple things that's the
[1:29:09] prophet's illustration
[1:29:10] as you go along you begin to learn if
[1:29:12] you don't learn there's something wrong
[1:29:16] see you've got to learn you've got to
[1:29:18] learn how to accept
[1:29:19] god and what it really means and
[1:29:22] from this message this morning this is
[1:29:25] what we learned we've got to love
[1:29:26] god and the truth at the very depths of
[1:29:29] our being
[1:29:30] right that's the good soil and then the
[1:29:33] word that falls on it it can produce the
[1:29:35] right thing
[1:29:36] if we just keep any love for the world
[1:29:38] out of our hearts
[1:29:40] praise god got to learn
[1:29:46] like some great lessons for me have been
[1:29:47] learning how to deal with brethren
[1:29:50] like preachers especially over the years
[1:29:54] preachers that preach false doctrine
[1:29:56] preachers have accused me of things or
[1:29:58] preachers that have accused my loved
[1:29:59] ones of things you know
[1:30:02] that has been some of the greatest
[1:30:03] lessons i've had to learn
[1:30:06] i've had to learn how to be gentle and
[1:30:09] not fly off
[1:30:10] loose off the handle brother right
[1:30:15] i've had to learn how to be patient
[1:30:17] right and
[1:30:18] and listen to people and and meet with
[1:30:21] them face to face
[1:30:22] that's been some of the harder lessons
[1:30:23] to learn
[1:30:25] i just told you the one about you know
[1:30:27] i've had to learn to be more patient
[1:30:29] between the miracles or between the
[1:30:30] souls saved right think about when was
[1:30:32] the last soul that was really saved here
[1:30:34] that was really saved in our church
[1:30:36] they got baptized well the little ones
[1:30:38] yeah little ones
[1:30:40] so in between the last one well i think
[1:30:41] it was uh charis was the last one
[1:30:43] baptized right
[1:30:46] is that right karis i think so so look
[1:30:48] now we've gone a couple of years between
[1:30:50] soul save right
[1:30:53] but it's easy to get excited when
[1:30:54] somebody gets saved right it's easy when
[1:30:56] somebody gets healed like with bang's
[1:30:57] father and who is father
[1:30:59] but in between there the lord is
[1:31:00] teaching me patience praise god
[1:31:03] i've got to be able to learn in the
[1:31:04] midst of these uh
[1:31:06] lower times of these these times of of
[1:31:08] waiting i've got to learn
[1:31:11] to receive christ's strength for this
[1:31:13] hour
[1:31:14] amen praise god
[1:31:18] i'm learning church i'm learning and you
[1:31:21] pick up your bible this morning did you
[1:31:23] learn something this morning
[1:31:26] hopefully you'll learn something right
[1:31:27] now praise god by god's grace
[1:31:30] see if you're not learning something's
[1:31:32] wrong
[1:31:33] something's wrong with us now this is
[1:31:35] what i want to say too
[1:31:37] i want to learn don't you want to learn
[1:31:38] to be more obedient to the nine gifts of
[1:31:40] the holy spirit
[1:31:42] i preached on that over and over as the
[1:31:44] years go by but this is
[1:31:45] clearly an area where we can grow we've
[1:31:47] got to learn so that if god wants to
[1:31:49] send a
[1:31:50] tongue in here or an interpretation or a
[1:31:52] prophecy or a word of correction
[1:31:54] or a word of discernment we've got to
[1:31:58] learn to let that happen by god's grace
[1:32:00] right
[1:32:02] we've got to learn to accept that praise
[1:32:04] god
[1:32:05] we've got to learn to lay aside
[1:32:08] everything
[1:32:09] and be totally devoted to god amen
[1:32:14] see that's something that we can learn
[1:32:16] this is
[1:32:17] time to learn this is time to understand
[1:32:19] the things this is time to
[1:32:20] not just know to hear about the message
[1:32:22] but to make the message live praise god
[1:32:25] amen thank the lord
[1:32:29] now remember this i just he wanted to
[1:32:32] grow in understanding of the lord
[1:32:34] so he constantly prospered as long as he
[1:32:37] he thought
[1:32:38] and increased his strength in the lord
[1:32:43] now an angel may visit you
[1:32:47] after prayer to give you strength right
[1:32:50] because jesus was in the garden he said
[1:32:52] father let thy will be done but not mine
[1:32:57] now church let me ask you why do you
[1:32:59] think the angels strengthened him in the
[1:33:01] garden
[1:33:03] so so he could disobey the will of god
[1:33:05] or so he could obey the will of god
[1:33:08] see after prayer when we don't want to
[1:33:10] do something
[1:33:11] and and then you know that we pray and
[1:33:13] then we feel like we've got to do it
[1:33:15] we've just received strength praise god
[1:33:18] we if we went into that prayer asking
[1:33:20] god can i not do this
[1:33:22] do i have to do this and yet we get up
[1:33:24] from our knees
[1:33:25] and we're able to do it an angel visited
[1:33:27] praise god
[1:33:29] an angel
[1:33:33] there's been times like that i didn't
[1:33:34] want to go to meetings i didn't want to
[1:33:35] call people didn't want to face certain
[1:33:37] situations
[1:33:38] but i got on my knees and prayed and god
[1:33:39] gave me the grace to do it praise god
[1:33:41] amen and now i'm just really right
[1:33:43] realizing now it was an angel amen
[1:33:45] praise god what where did that strength
[1:33:48] come from the angel of god the messenger
[1:33:53] an angel appeared to him strengthen him
[1:33:55] now we might not even see it but we
[1:33:56] don't have to see it praise god
[1:33:58] because we know it's there by promise
[1:33:59] amen he encamps about those that fear
[1:34:02] the lord
[1:34:04] now look he had a look he got enough
[1:34:06] strength so he could do what pray more
[1:34:08] and being in agony he prayed more
[1:34:10] earnestly
[1:34:12] hallelujah praise god well jess i want
[1:34:15] to be stronger
[1:34:16] okay well if he gives you more strength
[1:34:17] that means you're going to pray more
[1:34:19] praise god
[1:34:21] see we we we might think it'd be speak
[1:34:24] the word or go lay hands on somebody
[1:34:25] but sometimes god gives us strength to
[1:34:27] pray more
[1:34:29] to pray more and this this was of course
[1:34:34] preparing to be arrested preparing to go
[1:34:36] be crucified
[1:34:39] strength just to accept what has
[1:34:42] happened
[1:34:42] i don't like what's happened maybe jesus
[1:34:45] is flesh was saying that no doubt
[1:34:47] i don't like this can this cup pastor me
[1:34:52] but then the angel strengthened him and
[1:34:53] said yes lord let thy will be done
[1:34:56] not mine amen
[1:35:00] the strength of the lord so many times
[1:35:02] church we're going to get stronger
[1:35:04] in prayer i'll tell you i feel it almost
[1:35:07] every sunday i come up here
[1:35:09] i do these prayer requests i start
[1:35:11] praying pretty soon i feel the strength
[1:35:12] of the lord i don't know about you
[1:35:15] it just i don't come up here feeling
[1:35:16] that way many times but as you just
[1:35:18] start praying
[1:35:19] the lord just gives you faith and
[1:35:20] strength and it just raises your faith
[1:35:22] praise god
[1:35:27] now what else build strength
[1:35:30] obeying god and waiting on god or
[1:35:33] build strength now that's the thing i
[1:35:36] don't like too much and i guess you
[1:35:38] you could all probably say amen but i'll
[1:35:39] say amen to that i don't really like
[1:35:41] waiting all the time
[1:35:42] but when you obey and wait you get
[1:35:45] stronger
[1:35:48] now this is a beautiful beautiful
[1:35:50] chapter i just listened this morning
[1:35:51] go if you go there sis let me encourage
[1:35:53] the sisters real quick i haven't read
[1:35:55] this one for years i don't think
[1:35:57] uh isaiah 30 verse 1.
[1:36:05] somebody was telling me message
[1:36:08] teenagers sometimes the girls that
[1:36:10] they're not living the message they'll
[1:36:11] burn their hair right somebody's telling
[1:36:13] me that they burn their hair because
[1:36:14] they know
[1:36:15] they know they can't cut it with the
[1:36:16] scissors right they know if they cut it
[1:36:18] with scissors it's against the word but
[1:36:19] they can burn it there's nothing in the
[1:36:20] bible against burning their hair so they
[1:36:22] burn their hair
[1:36:26] but look what the scripture says verse
[1:36:27] one now you gotta look at the type here
[1:36:30] woe to the rebellious children saith the
[1:36:32] lord that take counsel but not of me
[1:36:34] and that cover with the covering but not
[1:36:37] of my spirit
[1:36:39] that they may add sin to sin
[1:36:42] so god is rebuking israel in this case
[1:36:45] many of them moved down to egypt
[1:36:47] and he said you're taking a covering
[1:36:48] that's not my holy spirit
[1:36:51] what was there covering the government
[1:36:53] of egypt the bible if you read this
[1:36:55] chapter
[1:36:55] they went down to pharaoh and said
[1:36:57] pharaoh save us pharaoh save us
[1:36:59] and god's saying you took a man-made
[1:37:01] covering like those women got today
[1:37:03] over god's covering the holy spirit and
[1:37:06] you sisters when you keep all that hair
[1:37:08] and you don't burn your hair
[1:37:09] and you don't cut your hair that
[1:37:11] represents the covering
[1:37:13] of the holy spirit amen is oh you're
[1:37:16] under the cut you're covered by his love
[1:37:18] amen
[1:37:18] you're covered by his spirit praise god
[1:37:20] and you want all of his covering amen
[1:37:23] because the bible said your hair has
[1:37:24] given you for a covering
[1:37:28] see that now in this chapter
[1:37:32] isaiah is rebuking them but then he
[1:37:33] gives him great grace
[1:37:36] he says you need to get you need to
[1:37:38] return from egypt isn't that interesting
[1:37:39] god brought him out of egypt brother
[1:37:41] vang and they went back into the world
[1:37:44] just like abraham right we're all human
[1:37:46] right
[1:37:48] so isaiah is calling them out this is 7
[1:37:50] 13
[1:37:51] 713 years before christ
[1:37:54] let's see that's this let's do the math
[1:37:55] there 1500 moses brought them out so 5 6
[1:37:58] 8 800 years later
[1:38:00] 800 years after leaving they wanted to
[1:38:02] go back
[1:38:04] and god tells isaiah he said go tell him
[1:38:06] thus saith the lord
[1:38:08] the holy one of israel in returning and
[1:38:11] rest shall ye be saved
[1:38:14] in quietness and confidence shall be
[1:38:18] your what
[1:38:18] shall be your strength how am i going to
[1:38:22] be stronger about jesse well according
[1:38:23] to this scripture
[1:38:25] the bible says when you the bible says
[1:38:27] when we
[1:38:28] rest in confidence and wait on the lord
[1:38:30] and just obey his promises
[1:38:32] yeah life might be easier down there
[1:38:34] with egypt my
[1:38:36] life might seem more prosperous but i'm
[1:38:38] going to hang on to god's promises
[1:38:40] i'm going to remain in the land amen i'm
[1:38:42] going to keep god's word
[1:38:43] the bible said in quietness and
[1:38:45] confidence you're stronger here than
[1:38:47] compromising in the world
[1:38:49] glory i'll be stronger
[1:38:53] staying in the promise of god yet being
[1:38:55] tested
[1:38:56] yet having less yet having a harder life
[1:38:59] amen
[1:38:59] i'll be stronger here in the word than i
[1:39:02] would be out there in the world
[1:39:06] now of course he said you would not now
[1:39:07] a few verses later he says god is
[1:39:09] gracious and god's going to bring you
[1:39:10] back and god did
[1:39:12] god did but see they were trusting they
[1:39:15] were trusting in those stimulus checks
[1:39:16] can i just say like that
[1:39:18] which i thank the lord for but i'm not
[1:39:20] trusting in it right
[1:39:22] i'm not like oh i love joe biden i'm
[1:39:24] going to vote for buying so he can send
[1:39:25] me 2 000
[1:39:26] but then he only sends you 1400. like it
[1:39:29] matters right
[1:39:32] but the point is we're not trusting in
[1:39:33] the government right
[1:39:35] we're trusting in the god of god who
[1:39:37] made earthly government praise god the
[1:39:39] god who's above all government
[1:39:41] we're trusting in that but what does
[1:39:42] strength look like many times
[1:39:45] it's just quietness resting in the
[1:39:47] promise of god
[1:39:48] i'm going to wait right here i'm not
[1:39:49] going to run away i'm not going to
[1:39:51] forsake the word of god
[1:39:52] i'm going to stay right in my position
[1:39:54] i'm going to stay right where god called
[1:39:56] me
[1:39:56] i ain't going anywhere satan get satan
[1:39:59] is not going to cause me to flee
[1:40:00] i'm keeping the ground that jesus gave
[1:40:02] me and i'm going to stay here until he
[1:40:04] moves amen
[1:40:06] i'm not going gonna forfeit the
[1:40:08] blessings that he's given me
[1:40:11] i'm not gonna retreat right i
[1:40:16] i fought for every inch of this and i'm
[1:40:18] not giving satan one inch back
[1:40:20] amen praise god i didn't hear you but
[1:40:23] man we fought for all these almost 15
[1:40:25] years brother
[1:40:26] let's not give the devil an inch amen
[1:40:28] hallelujah
[1:40:31] i was reading through my old uh articles
[1:40:33] malachi maokai had a dream in 2013
[1:40:37] he said there was two ships you remember
[1:40:39] this buddy there was two ships
[1:40:41] it was right after one night we were
[1:40:43] dancing the bluegrass christian music
[1:40:45] it was the day after our let my wife and
[1:40:47] i our 11th anniversary
[1:40:50] now i had a dream i was reading through
[1:40:51] it on my dream document you know
[1:40:54] malachi said there was two ships he said
[1:40:57] one of them was upside down
[1:40:59] he said but our family in the church was
[1:41:01] in the bottom layer of the boat
[1:41:03] kind of reminds me of paul when paul was
[1:41:05] at that ship you know but he contacted
[1:41:07] the angel of the lord down there
[1:41:09] and maokai said he dreamed he said
[1:41:13] as the dream went on the the other the
[1:41:15] other boat was
[1:41:17] capsized he said but then we started
[1:41:19] dancing and praising god and worshipping
[1:41:21] god
[1:41:22] on the bottom of the boat and he said
[1:41:24] then the dream said the next
[1:41:25] night or the after the night the morning
[1:41:27] came and we looked out of the boat
[1:41:29] and the other boat was saved
[1:41:33] and whoever was in that boat was saved
[1:41:35] because of our worship
[1:41:37] in the midst of the storm in the midst
[1:41:38] of the darkness
[1:41:40] praise god amen amen
[1:41:43] that reminds me of paul and silas
[1:41:45] praying in the prison right
[1:41:46] reminds you of paul he hurt hears from
[1:41:49] the angel and he goes up there and says
[1:41:50] don't worry there's not one man going to
[1:41:53] lose his life
[1:41:53] go ahead and eat a little bit and now
[1:41:55] that should encourage us let's praise
[1:41:57] god amen
[1:41:58] let's be thankful let's be strong let's
[1:42:00] be uh
[1:42:02] quick to give him praise because he's
[1:42:03] with us amen and
[1:42:05] our ship won't sink let's let's take
[1:42:07] everything that we have
[1:42:08] let's keep all that we have because our
[1:42:10] lives will be used to save other lives
[1:42:14] just hang on church just keep praising
[1:42:16] god in the bottom of that boat amen
[1:42:18] just keep singing to the lord worshiping
[1:42:20] him giving him praise
[1:42:21] i like that dream i thought it was
[1:42:22] pretty scriptural praise god
[1:42:26] i'm not saying it is but it seems really
[1:42:27] scriptural to me
[1:42:32] like bro man said jesus in the ship
[1:42:33] right wake him up come on wake up jesus
[1:42:36] wake up we need you jesus amen
[1:42:41] it'll save us glory
[1:42:45] do you remember that dream now guy okay
[1:42:47] yeah that's why i wrote it down because
[1:42:48] i knew
[1:42:48] we both forget
[1:42:52] now this is one of the most one of the
[1:42:53] most beautiful quotes in the church age
[1:42:55] book i mean there's so many
[1:42:56] it's hard to say that now we're in the
[1:42:58] sumerian church age ephesus samurai
[1:42:59] second church age
[1:43:00] death was not the only seed of the false
[1:43:02] vine but even in the true vine there was
[1:43:04] creeping paralysis see
[1:43:06] we don't want to be paralyzed in our
[1:43:07] faith right
[1:43:09] and impotence you can't bring forth life
[1:43:11] right impotence is you can't bring any
[1:43:13] seed
[1:43:14] because they had already drifted from
[1:43:16] the unadulterated truth of the first few
[1:43:18] years of pentecost
[1:43:20] i like this here it is right here and no
[1:43:22] true believer
[1:43:23] is any stronger and spiritual healthy
[1:43:27] and alive than his knowledge of the word
[1:43:33] and adherence to the pure word of god
[1:43:36] as seen by multitudes of examples
[1:43:39] in the old testament no one is any
[1:43:43] stronger
[1:43:44] than their dedication to growing in
[1:43:46] knowledge and then obeying it praise god
[1:43:49] you'll never be any stronger you and i
[1:43:51] will never be any stronger until we
[1:43:53] get back to reading our bibles with a a
[1:43:55] joy
[1:43:57] to learn more knowledge and then go act
[1:44:00] on it praise god
[1:44:02] hallelujah how many want to be strong in
[1:44:04] the lord
[1:44:08] every time an old testament character
[1:44:10] falls like brother brahm says
[1:44:11] every time it's because they stop
[1:44:12] obeying the word and they stop
[1:44:14] seeking god they seek other things right
[1:44:19] uzziah sought the priesthood solomon
[1:44:21] sought the women
[1:44:23] instead of seeking after god praise the
[1:44:25] lord
[1:44:27] eve like we saw on wednesday eve sought
[1:44:28] the serpent instead of her husband
[1:44:30] right she desired him rather than her
[1:44:33] husband
[1:44:35] see our strength the true measure of our
[1:44:37] strength
[1:44:38] and how healthy we are spiritually
[1:44:41] is when we are gaining knowledge of the
[1:44:43] word we're understanding more
[1:44:46] and we're adhering to it we're obeying
[1:44:48] the pure word of god
[1:44:50] amen i'm almost done here i keep saying
[1:44:53] that
[1:44:55] oh i got 33 seconds left on my hour side
[1:44:58] i ain't going to finish in 33 seconds
[1:45:00] but uh i can i can
[1:45:02] get closer to finishing a thought here
[1:45:04] let's finish a thought
[1:45:07] yeah let's finish with the full armor of
[1:45:08] god here just as an encouragement to us
[1:45:11] uh how many love the lord today i just
[1:45:15] wanna
[1:45:16] i just wanna hear some amens there we go
[1:45:17] okay good good i hope i didn't offend
[1:45:19] anybody but if
[1:45:20] you don't actually if you're offended
[1:45:22] then the bible says and you need the
[1:45:23] right ground
[1:45:25] right if the word offends you you gotta
[1:45:26] get different ground praise a different
[1:45:27] soil
[1:45:28] you need a honest good heart praise god
[1:45:31] there's my hour
[1:45:32] so let me close you know maybe i'll save
[1:45:34] that here for the seat for tonight
[1:45:37] you're a different thought i wanted to
[1:45:38] save
[1:45:40] yeah let me go back to i'm gonna close
[1:45:41] with a different thought i'm not gonna
[1:45:42] do that let me close with this thought
[1:45:44] i started this last sunday yeah
[1:45:47] remember no man could stand before
[1:45:49] joshua if he if he and his church obeyed
[1:45:54] right bang we've seen it no one can
[1:45:56] stand before our church as long as we
[1:45:58] obey the word
[1:45:59] is that right jose that right all these
[1:46:02] years
[1:46:04] there's no devil that's going to take
[1:46:06] down our church what i mean in
[1:46:08] false doctrine or in sin there's no
[1:46:11] devil that's gonna
[1:46:12] take us into a worldly lifestyle as long
[1:46:15] as we obey the word of god
[1:46:18] remember there was two only two men we
[1:46:21] looked at this last sunday
[1:46:22] there's only two people that ever stood
[1:46:24] before joshua all the days of his life
[1:46:27] and the first one wasn't even his fault
[1:46:30] right the men of a.i killed those
[1:46:32] 30-some uh
[1:46:34] israelis now the gibeonites was his
[1:46:37] fault
[1:46:38] and also the bible said they didn't
[1:46:40] expel the gesturites
[1:46:42] so church says just remember this if he
[1:46:45] only had two losses
[1:46:47] if you only had two what were the
[1:46:48] reasons behind it
[1:46:51] the church members did and i'm putting
[1:46:53] myself in there too the pastor and the
[1:46:55] church members
[1:46:56] if we ever lose it's because we didn't
[1:46:58] confess all of our outward
[1:47:00] and secret sins before we try to do god
[1:47:04] a service
[1:47:06] right that's why they didn't that's why
[1:47:07] they lost that battle
[1:47:09] they just defeated jericho my they
[1:47:11] thought ah we're
[1:47:12] invincible right but then you know aiken
[1:47:14] didn't follow the commands of joshua
[1:47:16] he took the babylonian garment took the
[1:47:18] gold all that things
[1:47:19] he hid it in his house right
[1:47:24] he hid it in there and then when they
[1:47:26] went to go to the next battle
[1:47:27] they were defeated because all
[1:47:30] i love when god honors our prayers right
[1:47:33] thank the lord for that
[1:47:34] and he answers our prayers praise god
[1:47:37] but we've got to be dedicated to that
[1:47:40] not letting any bitterness rise up any
[1:47:42] roots a bit i'm sorry
[1:47:43] bitterness grow down rather roots of
[1:47:44] bitterness grow down
[1:47:48] we can't hide the worldly things in our
[1:47:50] lives you know
[1:47:51] one time there was how many people was
[1:47:52] that there's been three or four
[1:47:55] sisters that came into the message they
[1:47:57] don't go to our church anymore
[1:48:00] uh but after they left
[1:48:03] they you know i was talking to him and
[1:48:05] emailing and they said well i never got
[1:48:06] rid of the pants and the shorts that i
[1:48:08] had
[1:48:10] and i thought well that's exactly what i
[1:48:11] mean the reason they fell away
[1:48:14] is because they never got all the
[1:48:15] secrets sent out they still wanted to
[1:48:17] wear
[1:48:18] men's clothes right
[1:48:21] and the brothers that we've had you know
[1:48:23] come by and gone they
[1:48:25] they never got rid of their evil music
[1:48:28] they never really cleaned out all the
[1:48:30] way and they would tell me a few times
[1:48:32] well i'm going to delete all my songs
[1:48:33] i'm going to delete all my contacts and
[1:48:34] they never did
[1:48:37] yet i tell them to do that they know
[1:48:38] they need to do that they know the holy
[1:48:40] spirit tells them they need to do it
[1:48:42] praise god
[1:48:43] clean out your house amen and they don't
[1:48:46] do it
[1:48:48] and they wonder why they can't get the
[1:48:49] victory the next time
[1:48:52] because it's all got to be cleaned out
[1:48:54] of the house
[1:48:57] any secret sin has got to be dealt with
[1:48:59] praise god
[1:49:01] any secret sin it's got to be dealt with
[1:49:05] if we want
[1:49:06] a constant victory in the camp
[1:49:10] hallelujah thank you jesus i love it
[1:49:14] brother brahm says it's he said it's in
[1:49:16] the perfect walk having a perfect walk
[1:49:19] in other words
[1:49:19] just constantly obeying constantly
[1:49:21] confessing
[1:49:22] constantly obeying moving forward
[1:49:24] wanting to grow in the knowledge of god
[1:49:26] wanting to grow in the things of god
[1:49:30] and the third and the second one was
[1:49:32] actually joshua's fault
[1:49:34] he should have searched out those men's
[1:49:38] confessions and followed up on their
[1:49:41] stories because remember
[1:49:42] they said that they were giving nights
[1:49:43] but they were saying that i forget the
[1:49:45] actual story
[1:49:46] now i haven't read it for a few years i
[1:49:48] guess but they were making out that they
[1:49:51] were like
[1:49:51] wanderers and they you know uh like they
[1:49:54] didn't live in the promised land but
[1:49:55] they did live in the promised land they
[1:49:57] just didn't want to die
[1:49:59] and so they dressed up like they were
[1:50:00] old they had mold they got moldy bread
[1:50:02] and all these
[1:50:02] things to trick joshua and joshua didn't
[1:50:06] search out the matter like he should
[1:50:07] have
[1:50:09] right and that tells you and i
[1:50:12] we must search out and confirm all
[1:50:14] testimonies
[1:50:16] before we start making decisions right
[1:50:20] praise god the bible said he that
[1:50:24] answers a matter before he heareth it
[1:50:26] it's a folly and shame on to him and
[1:50:28] we're all guilty church
[1:50:29] i'm not putting anything on joshua i'm
[1:50:30] just as guilty right
[1:50:32] we're all just as guilty we all make
[1:50:34] mistakes but the thing is we got to
[1:50:36] learn from them i
[1:50:37] say like this joshua never made that
[1:50:39] mistake again amen praise god
[1:50:44] and even the you shall faint and be
[1:50:46] weary and the young men shall utterly
[1:50:48] fall
[1:50:48] but they that wade upon the lord shall
[1:50:50] renew their strength
[1:50:52] they shall mount up with wings as eagles
[1:50:54] they shall run and not be weary
[1:50:55] they shall walk and not faint musicians
[1:50:58] if you'll come here
[1:51:00] i'm gonna close with this one here
[1:51:05] many times it doesn't feel like it while
[1:51:07] we're waiting it doesn't feel like we're
[1:51:09] getting stronger but we are
[1:51:12] when we're waiting on god we're actually
[1:51:14] getting stronger with god
[1:51:16] and that's because we're not leaning off
[1:51:19] of his grounds
[1:51:20] we're keeping our land we're keeping our
[1:51:22] possessions amen
[1:51:24] we're continuing to dwell in our
[1:51:26] inheritance hallelujah
[1:51:29] can you put that quote back up there
[1:51:30] casey real quick i'm sorry i didn't get
[1:51:32] a chance to read that
[1:51:34] you know a couple years ago this song
[1:51:35] came out the reckless love of god how do
[1:51:37] you remember that song
[1:51:40] and you know there's a better word for
[1:51:41] it we'd probably say restless love of
[1:51:42] god right
[1:51:44] but did you know brother branham said
[1:51:45] that we can be reckless
[1:51:49] so don't feel bad if somebody ever
[1:51:50] saying that don't feel bad because about
[1:51:52] joshua in knowing that the command was
[1:51:55] great but having the assurance
[1:51:57] he could be fearless in other words god
[1:52:00] would never leave him
[1:52:01] so joshua could be fearless
[1:52:05] he could be uh and we'd caught reckless
[1:52:12] as long as he was pointed the right way
[1:52:15] amen
[1:52:16] hallelujah he might break up against the
[1:52:20] hill that would knock him backwards
[1:52:22] but he was headed in the right way he
[1:52:24] might he might run into a hill right
[1:52:26] and knock him backwards he could be
[1:52:28] reckless he could just move forward in
[1:52:31] the things of god
[1:52:32] he said but god would never leave him
[1:52:36] so can the church
[1:52:40] of the living god be reckless
[1:52:43] and fearless in faith if we're pointed
[1:52:47] the right way
[1:52:49] that's why church sometimes brother bang
[1:52:51] when people come up here for prayer for
[1:52:52] healing or something
[1:52:53] i don't always feel fearless
[1:52:57] i'll say it like this i don't always
[1:52:58] feel the anointing like that time when
[1:53:00] the
[1:53:00] tanya came up and got healed and brother
[1:53:01] aaron got him i didn't really feel
[1:53:03] a tremendous anointing but you know what
[1:53:06] the
[1:53:07] you know where the ramp says we can be
[1:53:09] wrecked we can be fearless with it
[1:53:11] though we can be reckless
[1:53:12] we can uh we can we we know what we're
[1:53:15] to do
[1:53:15] and we're just supposed to do it because
[1:53:16] we know it's right amen
[1:53:19] and that's what i've seen in many cases
[1:53:20] like that
[1:53:22] you might not feel something special you
[1:53:25] might not feel the fire shut up in your
[1:53:26] bones
[1:53:27] but if you know god's called you to do
[1:53:29] it you can be reckless in doing it you
[1:53:31] can be
[1:53:31] fearless you can go ahead and do it
[1:53:33] because you know it's part of god's
[1:53:35] commission for your life
[1:53:38] so can the church of the living god be
[1:53:40] reckless and fearless
[1:53:42] in faith if we're pointed the right way
[1:53:45] and he said as i was with moses i'll be
[1:53:47] with you i will not fail you
[1:53:49] nor forsake you he never forsaken moses
[1:53:53] how many know moses made a lot of
[1:53:54] mistakes
[1:53:57] god never failed moses
[1:54:01] he did not fail joshua he will not
[1:54:04] fail us he'll be with us
[1:54:08] let's stand to our feet praise god
[1:54:12] sometimes church i know you probably
[1:54:14] look at me you you you probably think
[1:54:16] i'm like
[1:54:16] banging my head against the wall right
[1:54:18] but why can i do that because i
[1:54:20] can be reckless with it amen i might not
[1:54:23] feel anything i might not have a sign
[1:54:24] and wonder a miracle
[1:54:26] but i know jesus said preach and lay
[1:54:28] hands on the sick
[1:54:29] they shall recover amen i know paul said
[1:54:32] preach
[1:54:33] and be instant in season and odysseys
[1:54:35] and whether you feel like it or not
[1:54:37] he said preach the word amen be reckless
[1:54:40] with it
[1:54:42] right that's so that's the attitude
[1:54:44] we're supposed to have
[1:54:45] if god's called me to this and that's
[1:54:47] what god wants us to have right this
[1:54:48] attitude of no matter whether i feel it
[1:54:50] or not
[1:54:50] i know god's word is right and i'm going
[1:54:52] to obey god's word
[1:54:56] where does the bible ever say uh be
[1:54:59] afraid and run from devils where does
[1:55:00] the bible ever say that
[1:55:03] no the bible said be fearless praise god
[1:55:06] jesus think about this jesus said his
[1:55:09] holy his unholy ghost-filled apostles
[1:55:11] right
[1:55:12] his non-holy spirit filled apostles he
[1:55:15] sent them two by two
[1:55:18] as doves right
[1:55:22] amongst wolves
[1:55:25] my goodness as lambs brother bank
[1:55:28] against wolves he sent them out there
[1:55:33] he said you be reckless right
[1:55:35] [Music]
[1:55:36] you be fearless to the lambs
[1:55:40] don't take script don't take bag don't
[1:55:43] take money
[1:55:44] you go preach the word that's how those
[1:55:47] original missionaries were set up
[1:55:50] so what do we got to be scared of church
[1:55:52] [Music]
[1:55:54] the thing is if we've got a word from
[1:55:55] the lord we can be fearless with it
[1:55:58] let me want to be fearless
[1:56:02] failure is not an option i'm going back
[1:56:04] to my little meeting
[1:56:07] i will not just survive
[1:56:10] freedom is near i choose to thrive
[1:56:15] i will live full force always on my
[1:56:18] knees
[1:56:20] praise god jesus will open the door
[1:56:24] because he gave me the keys i just made
[1:56:26] that
[1:56:28] how many how many know he gave you the
[1:56:30] keys to the kingdom
[1:56:33] peter's not the only one to heaven right
[1:56:37] he's the one that started having that
[1:56:40] and then any other person filled with
[1:56:41] the holy ghost glory
[1:56:44] can pray for the sick and they shall
[1:56:45] recover amen
[1:56:48] hallelujah he's the first one to open
[1:56:52] the door to the baptist
[1:56:53] holy ghost and any gentiles that was
[1:56:55] born again
[1:56:56] he can pray for someone and they can be
[1:56:58] born again he can open the kingdom for
[1:57:00] that person
[1:57:03] let's be fearless today by god's grace
[1:57:06] that's what we want let's have a word of
[1:57:09] prayer
[1:57:12] i'm not going to ask you to raise your
[1:57:13] hands but i'm going to pray that god
[1:57:15] make each one of us fearless
[1:57:20] the church helped you and i to learn
[1:57:22] that even if it's quiet like
[1:57:23] like isaiah 36 even if there's not a big
[1:57:27] move going on or something
[1:57:29] that we can be strong and have
[1:57:31] confidence in god
[1:57:32] and rest in the word of god and grow
[1:57:35] stronger

[1:57:39] sometimes in a prison of our minds in

[1:57:46] us
[1:57:47] amen he'll send his word in due season
