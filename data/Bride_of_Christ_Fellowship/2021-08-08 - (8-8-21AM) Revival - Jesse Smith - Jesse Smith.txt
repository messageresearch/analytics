TRANSCRIPT
========================================
thank the lord for his grace and mercy i actually didn't choose a text for this message let me choose it here let's go to hosea chapter six yes because i have some good quotes on that from brother branham as well hosea chapter six verse one like last sunday i'm going to take a little break from the joshua series in the morning and i'm gonna preach on uh revival this morning revival last sunday i looked at lukewarm never applies to your soul it never does it's impossible thank you it's impossible to be lukewarm when you're baptized with the fire of the holy ghost amen your soul can never be lukewarm your mind can your flesh hates the spirit of god most of the time unless it's fully anointed right uh has an anointing on it by the holy spirit but your your mind is lukewarm often your souls never luke warm if you're born again and today we're going to see similar thoughts about revival you are revived once in your soul but your mind needs revived constantly so when you say i need a revival well you're they're saying i need born again for the first time or my mind needs made alive again i need to put new thoughts in my mind amen that's why we don't go from i'm saved to this revival i'm not saved at the next one you know we don't go like that like brother man talked about that he laughed about people like that that's not how we live our lives we're revived once we're born again we're baptized by the holy ghost one time one revival in the soul and the rest of our days we keep our mind revived by the renewing of the holy ghost the thoughts of god praise god hosea chapter 6 verse 1. now this is prophetic church this is prophetic i believe this is not mistaken this is about 800 years before christ this is prophetic to israel receiving the baptism of the holy ghost praise god on the third day so it's prophetic of the day of pentecost but it's also prophetic of the hundred forty four thousand you'll see why chapter six verse one come let us return unto the lord for hath torn and he will heal us he has smitten and he will bind us up this is a people that is they were backslidden they were kicked out of the land right but they're allowed to come back right verse two after two days he will revive us jesus raised on the third day praise god and then once he raised they could be born again in the third day he will raise us up and we will live in a sight now this also means a day can be a thousand years right so after the 2000 year gentile age on the third day in the third thousand after that israel can be revived brother man you says that in the feast of the trumpets 64. verse 3 then shall we know if we follow on to know the lord his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter and former rain unto the earth the baptism of holy ghost what is the latter rain it's just a renewing of the baptism of the holy ghost praise god now this church this could have happened to where israel could have got a revival in their minds but remember in the old testament they could not be born again in the soul because the blood of jesus had not been shed right so they they could have had a third they could have a third day revival in the days of hosea but it only would have been in the mind it would not have been in the soul because the blood of jesus had not washed away sin let's have a word of prayer let's just bow our heads and you have a need on your heart let's just make it known unto the lord god is in control of all things he knows all things he's he's here to bless us he's here to help us and we're here to receive from him we're here to bless him and worship him so let's bow our heads here heavenly father we read your word we thank you for this holy word and god we ask god that your holy spirit will now get into the word lord break down any understanding we might misunderstanding we might have had and lord build us up in the correct understanding encourage your people strengthen your people lord god the revelation of the hour keeps growing it keeps unfolding we thank you that it brings us stability confirmation it establishes our hearts in the faith as we look to your soon coming dear jesus prepare us oh god for thy coming and god we know we'll be ready by the revival of the holy ghost in our soul and god help us to revive our hearts today our minds rather today in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god so i have quite a few uh slides and quotes and scriptures to share so i think i preached an hour and a half last sunday uh i may i may match that today so i'm just giving you a little warning i may i could match that today it's possible it's possible i couldn't do that by the grace of the lord and i know you're just a great loving people and i just want to preach on revival just plain and simple revival because it's a greatly misunderstood thing and i think the main misunderstanding church is people have about one quote where brother random says in the third seal the bride hasn't had a revival but you've got to look at the context of that quote and then look at all the quotes afterwards we're in revival right now church i don't know if you're born again you're you're in revival right now because it's in your soul and that quote in particular we'll get to that brother bran was talking about of course the latter rain right that last rapture that last anointing before the rapture if you look at the quote so we'll look at that today we'll get to it eventually by the grace of the lord but i want to start just with the foundational thoughts uh if you miss wednesday yeah everybody miss wednesday i show after i turn off the live stream i showed some videos just to kind of update you on things you know two weeks ago there was that hearing in the capital about the january 6 insurrection and they purposely targeted christians in that whole thing i don't know if you saw it one of the cops specifically said all these terrorists were christians they had signs that said jesus is king trump is our president jesus is the lord of lords king of kings church it's coming down to this spot where revelation 13 says there without the mark you cannot buy or sell right we see canceled culture canceling conservatives this is just the beginning we see the vaccine coming on right uh it looks like it might be mandatory it's all a pre-figure of this one world church system that's coming i'm glad i'm in the true church of christ though i have no more churches to join i'm not going to join theirs i've already joined the body of jesus christ by the baptism of the holy ghost amen we have no attraction to the things of the world we have no attraction to political powers and all the wickedness that uh that that is uh in that movement remember they're having revival but it's the wrong spirit they're having an antichrist spirit revival we're having the bride's revival amen praise god well let me get started here by the grace of the lord amen uh so we like to look here and uh and look at revival uh now the purpose church is to show how the lukewarm just like last week's sermon the born-again soul never needs revival because the soul can never be dead or lukewarm how can your if you have eternal life in your soul how can that life be dead it can't die it's eternal praise god right the quicken soul is eternally hot it can not sin first john 3 9 says the seed that's in you cannot sin it is impossible for the soul of a holy ghost-filled christian to ever disbelieve again because it's god's life in his soul now the human mind or spirit is where the daily revival takes place or i'll say it like this if let me say like this if you get a complex you'll skip your daily revival and you might have to get revived next week right because holy ghost field christians can have awful mind battles and complexes even brother branham had them right we get kind of quiet on that but that's the truth there's there's times even if we're born again we choose not to get revive that service and we keep in our depressed state or we keep in our angry state we keep in our bitter state we keep in our lying state brother ram lied to the irs i made it right right away but that proves somebody could lie but then not make it right right away and still have the holy ghost right so uh these are uh important things to keep in mind but ultimately if you are born again you you you you've already you uh you've already surrendered all responsibility of your soul to jesus so jesus is obligated because you've surrendered and you've identified yourself with his name and water baptism he's obligated to come around and correct you and help you come back to repentance and get you in the place where you need to be because he said i'll guide you into all truth now someone that's not born again will not be brought back to the truth right they can still be saved foolish virgin or they could lose their salvation like judah's name was blotted out jesus said if you don't repent i'll blot your name out of the book of life so see it all goes back to those four kinds of grounds jesus taught about praise god we looked at that recently i think it was last sunday night we looked at that yes again we reviewed it now so see soul revival happens once ephesians 2 verses 1 5 and 8 say you're you were dead and sins but now you're quickened or made alive hallelujah james 5 20 says when you convert a sinner's soul he you save his soul from death meaning his soul is alive hallelujah brother branham taught the revival of hosea 6 2 which we read for our text was the 144 000 israelis receiving pentecost so this means we receive that revival when we are born again now the revival is renewing our minds let's take your bibles if you would please let's go to ephesians 4. i don't you know i don't i don't make you hold your bible all service but uh you know from time to time i'll see people hold their bibles and they'll set it down then they know i'm just going to preach you know but let's pick up your bibles here for a moment ephesians 4 22 now this text speaks when you and i feed the the black dog or think about the black sins right or the black thoughts and says the right thoughts when we feed the black dog we actually put off the anointing we lose the anointing of the holy ghost in our minds and we put what's caught on the old man the bible says right we start thinking with the old thoughts and right you can remember i used to do that in high school or oh i used to do that after when i was a child or and they were maybe evil thoughts right evil deeds you can actually put off the new man in your thoughts the new thinking and put back on your old man right ephesians 4 22. so let's just look at this here and keep in mind how brother ram lied to the irs because he's he's our clear example we can see his life we truly know he was born again right if anyone was born again it was him praise god because he walked so closely to christ and marvelous gifts was so dedicated to jesus christ right we're all uh we're all aspiring to live that kind of a burning life for christ because he was one of the seven stars in the hand of jesus christ amen his life was burning with the shining light of the example of how to be a christian praise god amen verse 22 that you put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that ye put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness so see brother man when he lied to the eye house he said i was so nervous and he said my head was in a spin in other words he didn't renew his mind that moment and he he and he got the phone call he said mida tell him i'm not here and he slipped out but he was there and he lied to the irs they tried to pray for the baby and the holy spirit said you're going to put your lying hands on the baby and you had to go make it right confess to the irs that he lied to the irs so see how he he took off the new man and just got busy i'm sorry just got overwhelmed right we all get over 100 men overwhelmed the last week or two anybody lost your cool anybody lost lost your kindness no longer you're not kind for a few moments get angry you know upset worry fear i battle fear are they gonna make me get the vaccine i battled that right but i've had to overcome that praise i got to put on the new man amen right and so brother man uh was his head was spinning with nervousness how have i had meeting after meeting when is this ever going to end it's been years and years and years i don't see the ending of this so just tell them i'm not here but see he didn't act righteously but the bible said in verse 24 when you have the new man on you are righteous and you live in true holiness and so he repented of that right the holy spirit brought him back into righteousness and true holiness praise god verse 25 wherefore put away lying didn't brother ram lie what do you have to do you had to put away lying paul's writing this to holy ghost-filled saints that know how to operate their gifts this is the ephesian church this is the mature church amen this should be us hallelujah amen right we know how the gifts operate we know how to bring every gift into subjection the word of god we're not out there we're not sleeping with with family members and committing adultery and fornication that's the corinthian church right too much on emotion uh we still have spiritual things not truly uh filled with the holy ghost right but this is the mature church and paul tells the mature church you've got to put off lying you've got to put off stealing see these minor little things see god will forgive us of those we've got to put them off and put on the new man glory put away lying right like a prophet would how do you do that go confess i'm sorry i didn't tell you the truth and people think better of you if you do that speak every truth with his neighbor for we are members of one another be angry i'm angry this week i've been angry you can be angry though and not sin let not the sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil so see when brother adam was sitting there he gave a place in his mind to the enemy worry frustration right head spinning busyness uh cares of the world whatever you would say he gave a place but thank god the holy ghost took that place back amen he didn't he didn't the holy spirit didn't do it without his freemore agency brother brahma had to give his free moral agency over and accept the correction and make it right so see god's not going to force us to do it but he'll lead us to do it right denominations force right satan brother says satan is the god of force god doesn't force us but he heals us by his goodness he leads us to repentance amen he shows us his goodness and it helps us make the right decision and get our lives back with the new man the holy ghost man amen brought that up there that you can see that i don't have to reference that i just already preached it now this is i preached this a couple years ago after i listened to the message thirst from 1965 brother graham said in your soul you have free more agency your will or your desire you either choose faith or unbelief but the soul needs filled now these are all the same thing filled is the same as sealed it just has different applications clothe your soul needs clothes your soul needs circumcised all these bible terms your soul needs born again and now church we know your soul needs revived one time because the word quicken is basically the same as revived it needs made alive because you were your soul was dead in unbelief but now your soul has anointed with faith now your soul is anointed with the holy spirit praise god now show this i remember naomi like this one i showed this thing remember that when sister know me a while back we talked about that this kind of helps us see we don't get complexes in our souls we get complexes in our minds satan will build up a complex and that and we give a place to the devil right and so let's say i got a i got something against brother amen every time i think of amen oh i'm going to get i can't wait to get back when i'm going to get revenge on him i've allowed satan to get into my mind and build up a complex that attacks brother amen but the bible said we have the power and the weapons of warfare to cast down any stronghold any castle praise god anything that exalts itself the word of god we are we are mighty uh to cast these down and to clear the land of all complexes amen we're able to revive the mind revive the land praise god hallelujah thank god amen this is uh where the complexes take place in the mind but also the soul has one revival but in other words if you have complexes your mind needs revived your mind needs constant revivals so the main issue here will be going through the bible i'll go through the bible scriptures on revival and then go through some quotes and like i said the bride's revival quote is the most one people stumble at and if church if they take that wrong then they get all depressed and defeated like i haven't had revival church i know i've had revival i know what it was like to be a sinner and i thank god i know it's like to be a saint amen i am separated from the things of the world the things that i used to do i do them no more praise god christ has risen in me the day stars rise in my heart amen it was death in my soul it was dark in my soul but now i've got life in my soul amen nobody can tell me i'm not in the bride's revival because i know i was dead in sin and i know i'm quick now amen see i don't want our church to be defeated like that now if you've got a complex yes then you need revival let's clear that out let's let's take the word of god and let let's cast down those stones amen we can do it real quick it takes about five minutes maybe less you know you confess your sins and and go make it right you can cast that down in no time hallelujah but we don't want to be defeated message believers we don't want to be defeated holy ghost-filled saints we don't want to be complex filled saints we want to be revived saints so this was i was surprised this is a very simple bible study if you look up revive in the bible it's very simple there's only 26 hits now only 15 are in the bible these 11 are in the lexicons which they just give you know definitions of words right so this morning as as this thought came to me i only had to search about 15 scriptures it's a pretty short study it was kind of nice then i could spend more time on brother bran's quotes so it actually worked out really good by god's grace now see church our focus i said in the note will be the new testament application because the new birth is now available it was not available the soul jesus said i come to give your soul rest hebrews 4 said if joshua actually gave them rest then why did the bible speak of another day to give them rest right he gave them rest from physical enemies but jesus come to give us rest in our souls amen so the nature doesn't wrestle against god and trying to be saved and worrying about the souls that and that say the soul is sealed the soul has a foundation the soul has the souls marked amen the soul has the presence of god now both of the definitions are the same hebrew old testament and new testament they're both the same they both speak of physics like someone who's dead that comes back to life that's called a revival so jesus had constant revivals lazarus had a revival physically he died four days later he had a revival so so revival can mean your physical body but also uh your human spirit as well okay so we'll see it you'll see it this is old testament new testament so and the bible said jesus revived on the third day okay so revive means both to the body soul and spirit oh thank god amen and now in the new testament one who returns to a better moral state that's the one that we need we need constant revivals up here in our minds amen to stop worrying about the cares of the world stop worrying i'm trying to figure things out that haven't even happened yet trying to cross bridges before they get there let's just stand where we are praise god let's stand on the land that god has given us let's possess the land amen let's stand on the land that god has given us and not be a slave and not let castles be built up in our minds where we attack others but let's be clear from those so we can save others glory now in the old testament 13 scriptures so revive meant physically dead coming back to life depressed mind being healed so they could have revivals in the old testament in their minds more spiritual strength and one time it foretold the 144 thousand receiving the holy ghost so now remember saints the old testament saints could never receive the baptism holy ghost this means the only revival they could have would be in the human spirit or mind in the old testament now here's the scripture where jesus says on the the last day of the feast of tabernacles she said come drink if any man's thirsty come he said this is speaking of the holy ghost because jesus was not yet give i'm sorry the holy ghost is not yet given because jesus was not yet glorified god so a man like john the baptist the bible said he was full of the holy ghost in the mother's womb but that wasn't the soul that was the human spirit zacharias elizabeth all those old those old testament saints right at the end of the old testament transitioning into the new right in the gospels that's what i'm talking about the gospels the bible said they were filled with the holy ghost and prophesied that wasn't in the soul that was in the mind the bible said joseph was full of the holy ghost when he saw dreams the bible said bezolio was full of the holy ghost when he built uh the mercy seat and all those old testament tabernacle furniture pieces they were all filled with the holy ghost up here they had the new man up here but we're the ones who get the new man right here in the soul amen because the blood has done not just covered our sins but sent them away and abolished them never more no condemnation for you and i no guilt for you and i we're free from all condemnation because of the blood of christ hallelujah so here's the first one the therapist woman's son died elijah laid on him i think six times or breathed on six times and the bible said his spirit came back and revived see here's a case where revival meant you died now you're alive again we are going to have a great revival at the rapture amen the dead in christ arise amen that will be a great revival there praise god for the dead in christ here's another one uh a man's dead body would touch elisha's bones and that man revived so another a way another time revival means coming back from physically being dead genesis 4 here's jacob lost his son joseph right he thought he lost his son but then when he meets him he hugs him and the bible said his spirit revived that means he overcome that depression devil so all those years those was it 17 no 13 years he was gone maybe more maybe yeah 13 plus years could it could have been more 13 years he was gone he was overcome with his with a depression spirit that made him a gloomy and upset and depressed all the time but when he sees joseph he gets that revival back he has a revival he feels alive again oh church we ought to feel alive in christ today praise god if we're the joshua church leave nothing undone make sure you cover all the bases right do everything you can make sure all relationships are right and you'll have the right kind of spirit you'll live in revival if you do that if you leave uh sins undone or relationships kind of checked and you'll never have you'll never have the peace of god you've got to go to every situation leave nothing undone clear all the debts right clear all the matters and then you can have peace with god samson was so weary after killing those uh philistines the bible said he got some water and he revived so emotionally and physically the water revived him so you can have a physical revival get some water and then emotionally too right he revived ezra now ezra was that he was a trained priest and he went back in the second group that went back to israel from babylon right zerubbabel was the first group and they built the altar and the house of god but ezra was coming back to bring the word right they had the temple but they needed the word they needed a teaching priest and that was ezra and he brought back the word the second stage sanctification amen and the wall was the baptism of the holy ghost because it sealed them in i don't know thank god i appreciate that about 12 years ago amen just come back to me fresh so ezra was either on their way and he felt ashamed oh i asked the king for guards where's my faith right and he said lord we've got a little space now grace has been shown us uh to give us a nail in this holy place that our god may lighten our eyes and give us a little reviving see church i appreciate his honesty he just wants a little revival and maybe that's all he could get in that day but we don't want a little revival we want a great revival amen i don't want a little blessing from god i want all the blessings of god amen i don't want a little bit of the gifts i want all the gifts of the holy ghost amen hallelujah i don't want a little bit of faith i want a mountain moving faith praise god amen we want a great revival praise god not just a little for we were bond men yet our god hath not forsaken us in our bodies see church even if you're bound by a complex today god will not forsake you just humble yourself go make it right i've had to do it many times numerous times complex about that brother and that that situation many times i've had to do it but when we do it we feel free we get out of the bondage there's no more captivity amen our spirits are revived hallelujah god has extended mercy and the sight of the kings of persia to give us a reviving so god anointed these heathen kings can you imagine that god anoints a heathen king so you can have a revival hallelujah may god grant it whatever it takes church to give us revival send it lord i don't care if you got to serve something up on the job i don't care if you've got to stare at heathen up on the job or something that happened god send revival so i can live in the power of the resurrection a heathen king had to get anointed so this guy could have revival oh my thank god for his mercy church see it brought a little revival little strength this isn't david though this is a psalmist he just prays for now this is what we need constantly church you know you have to say amen you have to raise your hand i know this you need joy i need joy everything sucks away joy right ba every time i check the news bad news bad news i'm like when are they when am i going to get the good news it just sucks away your joy constantly right everything's done to suck away your joy but this psalm writer says thou will not revive us again that that people may rejoice he's asking won't you revive us so i can have joy again oh church that ought to be our prayer lord won't you revive me so i can have the joy of my salvation amen i don't want to be a depressed christian i don't want to be a a beaten down believer i want to be joyful i want to be happy i want to sing the praise of god i want to be a light i want to be salt to this world won't you do that lord what do you think he'd say absolutely just repent of all your sin right repent of any sin you have and i'll gladly bring you the joy of your salvation back amen hallelujah why is he going to do it because he's going to be merciful the god of mercy grant us thy deliverance grant us thy salvation praise the lord the church i can just see a difference like from last night i can just see a difference in our church we at least have people smiling shouting saying amen raising their hands the church last night they were pentecostal but everybody was just dead the preacher was spinning around and he would bless his heart he was trying to get them pumped up but church when you're born again you don't need pumped up you've got the pump inside of your soul the whale of eternal life amen it's pushing me it's pumping me up praise god amen there are some times you need to kind of remember to tap your foot and get on that anointing again you need to revive your mind and your body praise god but in your soul if you just yield to it if you'll just uh really get down to business with god and realize you the river of life flowing inside of you you've got revival flowing out of you constantly praise god i'm not one day out in the movie theaters and then back in the pulpit the next day i'm not one out one day smoking marijuana and then back in the pulpit i am constantly in the presence of god i am constantly revived i have passed from death unto life amen i am revived in my soul my soul has the nature of god and i've just got to get my mind on the word every day and that brings my whole body into revival mode amen praise god but it must be done in the mind amen you must bring your body into subjection to the word of god so david david says though the lord be high yet he has respect unto the lowly see if you feel love don't worry god's right there with you he's with he's with you on the mountain he's with you in the valley church right david when it was last time you were chased down with a bounty on your head for you know 15 years none of us were right this man had the royal the royalty the king chasing him down but he could still utter a few praises out of there i could i could still sing to jesus oh magnify the lord with me come exalt his name forever he could still muster a few praises in the midst of his trials of church we can do the same today do i walk in the midst of trouble thou will revive me i feel trouble all around me but i'm depressed i feel trouble all around me but i'm angry i feel trouble all around me but the bible says as even if there's trouble around me god will just change the situation and there will come some moment when the holy spirit will strike me i'll confess my sin i'll say god a song will come on or a sermon will come on or you'll shake a brother's hand or shake a sister's hand and all of a sudden even the midst of trial god revives you the old man is thrown down and the new man stands up and he's ready to face the enemy amen he's ready to face the trouble because he's put off now and in the midst of trouble god sends revival praise god that's what shadrach meshach and abednego had praise god they had revival in the midst of the trouble praise god noah had revival in the midst of the trouble they all had revival in the midst of the trouble if we just look to god our deliverer god will complete or perfect that which concerneth me we'll get to that in the next joshua sermon joshua had all the inheritance everything that was his he owned it brother johnny caleb got all his inheritance i will fulfill all the will of god for my life hallelujah yeah one point i'm kind of preaching my message for tonight i better i better stop right there i better save a little bit there save some for the sequel oh my so david knew he could have revival praise god hallelujah in the midst of trouble that's where we find revival so 700 712 years before christ isaiah said for thus saith the high lofty one that inhabiteth eternity look at that high lofty one that inhabits eternity we're just trying to describe this man we're just trying to describe this great jesus that we love right the high lofty and he lives in eternity in other words way far above us he's so great but thus saith the lord amen thus saith the high lofty one i dwell in the high holy place with him also that is of a contri heart and humble spirit church don't you see it although he's up there when you humble yourself it's as if you're seated in heavenly places with him because the bible said he's nigh unto you when you're a broken and contrite heart the bible says our hope is behind the veil anchored in heaven hallelujah amen so when you're down and low and all contrite and humble and repentant it's as if in the spirit you're up there with the eternal one in high lofty places you're having communion with the eternal one you're having a revival brother sisters we're having revival when we humble ourselves and say forgive me lord i didn't mean to do that help me to make the right choice i'll make the right choice next time you are now seated in heavenly places you're no longer dead in your minds you are now revived my spirit needs revived my heart needs revived just humble humble yourself be contrite be out of your mouth speak instead of the first that's contrite humble you're not trying to be seen you're not trying to be noticed by man you're trying to be noticed by god that's how revival comes he said i'll not contend forever will i be always wrath for the spirit shall fail before me and the souls repent why why do people think god is going to burn people eternally with no end for just 50 years of sin here's the text we read revival came on the third day so this types 144 000 because one day peter says is like a thousand years now this is seven eighties this is even before isaiah yeah then forgive me then this this is not after the captivity this is before the captivity so forgive me that was my fault that was my fault hosea was before the captivity that's my fault forgive me so what does broadband say look recognize your day this message after two days he'll revive us or give us a revival bringing us together the jews speaking of these trumpets now and he shall remember the trumpets represent the two prophets right as a prophet represented by a trumpet and he shall we shall live in his sight or have see or have eternal life so brother man brother is talking after the rapture the jews will get eternal life what is eternal life revival revival in the soul praise god see we'll be in a sight the bible said here in hosea and we shall live in his sight have life in his sight that's his own life eternal life have life in his sight she that lives in pleasure is dead while she's alive that's a zombie that's a modern-day zombie right a spiritual zombie we've got a lot of church members today like that right even message people so we promised that israel again would have life in his sight she's been dead to these facts or to the facts and to the pentecostal feast so see because she's dead to pentecost she's not alive church that means if we're in pentecost we're alive amen this is the revival to the soul israel received i'm sorry the 120 received it on the day of pentecost i received it in 2003 when did you receive it amen hallelujah i've been revived since 2003 praise god and i'm still living on this same revival hallelujah i haven't slowed down i haven't given up i haven't quit i'm pressing on toward the mark of the high calling in christ hallelujah so here hosea likens revival under growth in plants sometimes i run over plants with a lawnmower to my wife's disdain so forgive me honey i don't mean to but i noticed they grow back sometimes sometimes right now that's what he says when you dwell under a shadow church you revive as the corn and grow as the vine i've run thereof shall be as the wine of even your scent even the wine see there's a joy of stimulation the wine hallelujah the line of stimulation in other words god will give you some great revelation it'll stimulate you praise god i know everybody god's pouring out revelation after revelation praise god i'm happy to drink on the wine of god thank god amen i'm bringing forth new life all the time i'm growing as a christian before i couldn't face this but now i can face it because jesus told me only be strong and very courageous and no man no woman no preacher no anybody will stand before you all the days of your life and the church said if you're anointed the holy ghost and you're in the right church you have nothing to fear of there's nothing to be said about nothing to be discouraged about you are going to bring forth growth you're going to face that obstacle and you'll overcome i'm facing a couple this week so pray for me this is inspiring me to get some more things kind of talked about with some other people so not our church but outside of our church but if i heard then please come to me because i don't want to hurt anybody you know please if there's anything i've done wrong please let me know i'm happy to repent make it right if i'm wrong praise god habakkuk 3 now remember this is a beautiful prayer this is after chapter one and two in chapter one habakkuk complains lord where are you the people aren't being judged evil's going on and god answers them and he said he said write the vision on the table he said wait upon it it shall come to pass it will not delay in other words god rebukes the prophet for complaining church god will rebuke us for complaining but then he'll give us the word he'll give us some encouragement praise god it's going to be plain on tables just don't worry it's going to come to pass just wait on it in other words you need more patience church right that's what god's saying we just need a little more patience just wait for it don't complain just wait it'll happen praise god so now habakkuk gets re he gets corrected by god and he prays oh lord have i've heard thy speech and was afraid see these people that it's all joy in the presence of the lord there should be brother bran calls some joy spells there should be joy spells like we just talked about wine but then sometimes when you're presence of the lord it's fearful yeah it's fearful angels all those things it's fearful but you see people laugh and joke about demons and god that's probably not god that's probably some demon right they're just entertaining demons thinking it's god or something like that satan can transform himself from a messenger of death to an angel light right oh lord revive thy work now church you know this god never stopped working but the prophet's like revive your work in other words do more things so i can see your work in this land does god ever stop working we just sing that song right waymaker america he never stops working never stop how do you believe that he never stops working so habakkuk is kind of asking not for god to do something god's always doing something he's saying let me see what you're doing let me see judgment brought down upon the earth god never stops working church don't let the devil ever tell you god stops working god is working for you he will perfect that which concerned with you amen he will finish the good work philippians 1 6 he will finish the good work that he started in you praise god so we got to understand this habakkuk's asking for something i can see but god never stopped working he said revive your work and if you read the rest of the chapter he's talking about bringing judgment on the wicked he's talking about the mountains falling he's talking about the oceans roaring see but i want you to know god never stops working let me say like this god don't need a revival i need the revival is that right church habakkuk's not you've got to understand what he's saying he's not saying god you need a revival no we need the revival praise god in other words let me see what you're doing let me see some of these heathens judged let me see some of the righteous exalted amen let me see you answer some prayers and heal the sick and feed the poor praise god and clothe those that are naked praise god let me see you move move in our midst jesus amen now that's the old testament those are almost all the old testament scriptures a couple i left out because they didn't really apply to this sermon or they were repeats so let's go the new testament so the new testament only has two scriptures on revival pretty easy study brother william i must admit i thank the lord for a little wasn't too hard today sometimes you know you know i like preachers sometimes you just they're like lord i i just jesus i don't know help me i'm yeah and that that's most times right but i'm just saying this wasn't too hard of a search this morning praise god i got up at four for some reason the holy spirit woke me up at 4 45 so i've been up kind of early today so must been get this message ready for you i tried to sleep in too all right now so the first time is romans 7 9 for i was alive without the law once now of course that's when he's young he didn't know the law but when the commandment came sin revived and i died and the commandment which was ordained to life i found to be unto death so paul's talking about his youth when he first learned to the law his sin nature and his body rebelled against the law or revived it came alive right in other words when somebody says don't don't eat the cookies in the cookie jar what are you gonna do as a kid well you're probably gonna steal one right that's kind of what it is beforehand you didn't have the cookies or you didn't know about it but now you know oh there's cookies in there oh well i'll wait till dad's asleep i wait till mom's i'll wait till dad's out at work and see once you got the commandment don't touch him then your your sin revives don't you hate that when you're saying revise it yeah oh he does that amen stop reviving stay dead amen see you've got to crucify him again amen crucify that sin nature constantly paul said you must crucify it the affection than the lusts thereof but it's almost like the flesh when it happened it knows it can do wrong oh now i get to do wrong now that's going to revive and paul said when i did that i sinned he said then it became death oh i can't have any cookies in the cookie jar i can't have any of those things i i you die i know i'm guilty oh i'm so unworthy but then paul said later he said but with my mind i serve the law of christ see he had to train his mind to overcome that desire now for some of us we'll just eat too many cookies then we don't want anymore right no let's hope not we don't want diabetes church and i say that sincerely you don't want diabetes i've had some friends that have diabetes because they drink too much diet coke you don't want limit your sugar praise god let me limit it i've seen children with diabetes don't no no limit it okay back to the sermon all right so it deceived him right it deceives you oh it's going to taste so good that cookie it's going to taste so good it deceives you into disobeying the word and then you feel dead right it's death that's the one that's the one time here's the second time it's used in the revived is used in the new testament for whether we live we live in the lord whether we die we die lord whether we live thereof or die we are the lords for to this and christ both died and rose revived that's kind of like that song we say you're saying today buddy beautiful song he revived that he might be lord of both the dead and the living jesus body revived or came back to life when the holy ghost came upon it right in one place jesus said i'm going to raise up the body in the other place jesus said god's gonna raise up the body it's not two persons one person two manifestations amen two manifestations we've been looking at the godhead on wednesday night so that's why it's funny or it's fitting i'd rather say now i didn't want to stop there since it was a very short search so i went to the lexicon now three of them were actually scriptures one is just a mention of being revived in the days of jonas's life so jonas uh the father of peter i guess they had a little revival before peter's generation so let's look at these three words church so we get a better idea to prove all these things i've showed you that the revival comes in the mind for us once it's in the soul right the baptism holy ghost but then all the other revivals are up here in our minds okay so the first word i'm artanino's i'm not even sure how to say that and when the chief shepherd shall appear you shall receive account of glory that faith not away so the glory is always revived it's always growing so when you get to heaven it's a it's a growing revival amen praise god see you know how death death slowly creeps in here right i feel more and more tired all the time you get just as you get older you get more gray i grew up my beer last week i had all these gray hairs in there brother i'm like wait i mean come on i'm trying to take care of myself but it's slow death but heaven is the opposite heaven is slowly more and more life it's slowly slowly more rival revival and it doesn't stop it's eternal revival amen it's the opposite of of this this is slow death till complete death that will be life life life until complete eternity praise god amen so with each passing year we're going to feel more revived oh my we've had one age i can't wait to go to the next age i just feel stronger this age i can go visit i can speak a world and go live of course i want to be around jesus i don't really want to go to the world but of course i have all eternity so maybe i could take a little vacation you know each and every passing age of the cycles of eternity each time around i feel a little bit more revived and strong and thankful for all god's done i'll be able to praise him by the amen like i want to amen i don't know you'll be able to sing and praise him the right way because i'm getting more strength all the time oh my praise god hallelujah oh thank you jesus anna zayo and isaiah for this my son was dead and is alive again the prodigal so this is spiritual life again spiritual life again so repenting right now you can type that to the baptist holy ghost where he gets the new clothes and the ring of authority you can type that to the baptism of the holy ghost right because the bible said if we don't have the when we get the holy ghost we have robes of white right garments of white remember the the remember the fifth seal the jews they don't have robes he said you're going to get them later see so you can type that to repentance sanctification baptism of the holy ghost now revelation 20 but the rest of the dead live not again into the thousand years we're finished so revive means to physically live again as well revelation 20. third one a nap sucho an absolute joke the lord give mercy unto the house of ones the force for he oft refreshed me he often revived me brother i'm gonna tell you you have revived me this summer since you came brother i'm gonna tell you that each time i get fellowship with johnny revive me you know each one of you all your brothers whenever i talk to you i always feel revived you revive me you refresh me right because i get to see how god's working in your life or how you're obeying the holy spirit or you just say inspired things praise god or you sing an inspired song right it just it refreshes us see that's why church we need each other we give each other revival amen and god ordained it that way praise god that revival flows through the body not outside the body through the body praise god we need each other to revive each other don't feel revived come to church you'll get revived i'll revive you i'll come down if you want i can slap you on the lane and say come on brother is that right brother come on sarah come on i'll revive you no i won't do that all the time i don't do that too much oh sorry press the wrong button so paul says oh nephas oh no enough assault on sephora sorry sop me out sometimes we gotta go looking for our brethren to refresh them where's that brother where's that sister let me give him a call real quick the lord grant unto him that he may find mercy in the lord in that day and how many things he minister he served my he met my needs ones the forest maybe brought food maybe brought a new song i don't know maybe brought another cloak because this is yeah that's right of his life maybe i don't know you know just you can use your imagination he brought the needs that paul needed in prison and he said he often refreshed me this guy always revives me church i want to be one of those kind of saints don't you sister don't you want to be the kind of a sister when you talk to other sisters you revive them you just give them a fresh jolt of joy amen praise god amen you just make somebody happy you just make somebody sweet again you make them joyful you know church that's what we need to be we need to be encouraging one another we need to refresh one another that's true that's true church we can really revive each other so emoji checkmark that's all the bible verses on revive very simple study right very easy so we can't take something so simple and confuse it like a lot of people do oh you need saved again you need a revival again you're dead and my soul can never be dead we need a week-long revival well you don't have to have the bible doesn't say you gotta have a week-long revival it's really gonna get you revived but you should be doing that on your own right you know where does it ever mandate you gotta have an all-night prayer meeting it's a good thing but where does it mandate it in the bible jesus taught his disciples how to pray he didn't say you have to have all night prayer meaning to be revived those are good things if you're seeking god and church if you seek god you will find him amen i'm not discouraging that i'm just saying sometimes we hear statements and if we're not doing these things then we feel discouraged this in church we're not we're not to be discouraged we have no condemnation if god is for us who can be against [Music] but the one thing we can do is make sure our minds are revived and that will revive our bodies as well so we can do the work of god so now we have to understand every quote from brother branham and any other preacher according to the bible definitions of revival did you see any bible verse that said you need revived in your soul many times i didn't see that do you ever see a scripture where it says your soul needs sealed and resealed and re-sealed again do you ever see any scripture on that yet people will preach it they'll say you need to born again again i was i was born again one time i don't need to be born again what i need is a revival of my mind that's what i need praise god i need my first love back because if i got my first love i'll act like i did at the beginning i'll do the first works come on church that's what we need we need to do the first works because works is your faith expressed amen if you've got real faith you'll do the right works amen you didn't lose your faith your faith had just been a little bit hindered your house might have got spoiled your mind might have got spoiled a bit it happens to all of us don't feel bad i'm not condemning anybody we just got to condemn the devil all right we got to confess sin right and get sin under the blood so here let's try to understand some of these quotes if we can here yeah so these were that that was my reminder list i don't i don't really need that so brother ham said we need a revival every day in our human spirit how many can say amen to that how can i overcome after the seals now look at this church here's my text this morning i chose this because i think it's a time that we should never let the spirit of revival die we've got to keep in revival constantly revive every day paul said he had to die daily that christ could live and we must never let that revival die within us the revival is never outside of us in some special meetings or on a preacher's ipad the revival's always in us church right the revival is in us and we've got to get out the trash we're going to see that quote familiar quote but eventually got to get the trash out that brings the revival now god can use the preacher god can use the special meanings but there's no excuse we shouldn't have revival every day of the week i know you you can even you can even be tired and worn out in your body but still have revival you can sit back on your couch on your lazy boy on your day off and just listen to songs and listen to brother branham or listen praise the lord and just smile and praise god and you can still have revival hallelujah because the revival's up here the revival's here if you already got it here it's right here is where we need the revival so see the revival in the human spirit returns you to your first love or your first works your first thoughts right and this all ties in with seek ye first the kingdom of god first love first works doing what you know should be done first hallelujah revival doesn't mean getting new members it's reviving what we've already got see i was watching the waves on lake michigan the great revival ah i like that we're going to see that later they're coming in a great tide sweeping it out i thought my you know it reminded me the song floods of joy over my soul like the sea village is that what nature reminds you of it should remind you of oh that's the joy of god that's the blessings of god on my life instead of instead sometimes rain all rain it's depressing uh nothing the sun's not shining in my life you gotta look at rain like that's the blessing i'm gonna get the latter rain i got the former rain i'm getting the ladder ring too praise god let nature speak good things to us praise god he thinks of a song about joy watching the waves come in that's what we need my our minds on is the things of god the the good blessings of god see the waves start somewhere out in the laker ocean as they come they build up momentum all the time then finally they strike the shore they go out come in again now church that's what we should see we should see momentum in our lives in other words i see god moving me to do something right and i feel stronger about this now than last year that's how i feel about witnessing now they got my book i i felt the momentum coming so i just got to go do something now i've got the momentum i'm having revival praise god amen so you'll feel the momentum i feel god leading me to believe this i feel god leading me to do this and it should it should do that it should and it should move out any fear amen it should move out any unbelief the revival of god should grow in our lives amen that's what the type is the bible grows so each service i get a little closer to that desire each service i'm closer i feel the momentum i feel the blessing coming amen i feel the healing coming i feel the soul being saved i feel revival for me i feel the change of the enemy going to be broke i feel it moving it's moving inside of me looks like we could use some revival today that's the way the waves of god's glory does it's a glory rule praise god it's a wave of glory rolling over us it just rolls over and over back and back back and forth the waves of joy of god rolls through our soul thank you for saving me jesus oh thank you for the cross ha i don't know how you died for me i don't know how you did it but thank you for doing for and i love you so much i'm going to try to witness to somebody today i'm going to try to pray for my my loved one today i'm going to try to write a letter i'm going to try to do something i will do something because i feel the glory rolling within my soul i feel moved to do something for god oh church let's have revival praise god let's have revival let's be moved by the holy spirit to do something for the glory of god i wonder what was the use of that what's the use of that during churn of the waves nature has a way of taking care of itself so this is god's way to take care of you service after service bring a little more pushing you pushing you till you finally get that victory praise god see oh it's preached about again oh it's going to be preached about again and pretty soon it's here praise god revival's here hallelujah praise god just like the people you know you're in a church with your pastors what see look brother man doesn't say when you're with me he said when you're with your pastor so come on somebody help me praise god so i'm a pastor i'm trying to let the waves of glory roll through me and that they'll roll through you praise god do your part let the waves roll over you let the glory ruin your life feel the momentum of the holy spirit saying i'm not lukewarm i'm revived i'm on fire for jesus feel the glory roll feel the wave of the holy ghost move you beyond any depression any complex any doubt any fear let the holy spirit move you beyond that with your pastor praise god with the church move beyond that and enjoy the blessings and revival of god oh my i'm pouring out my soul this morning church i'm pouring out my strength my soul i believe this with all my heart people want to have special meetings that's great special meetings are fine we have them too or conventions or things like that but the real believer can have revival in any service anytime no matter if it's just the pastor preaching because it don't matter about the pastor it matters about the glory praise god the ways of glory is what matters praise god letting it have you move you have momentum in your life move you to more obedience in the word of god maybe there's no excitement going on or nothing unusual kind of like this morning nothing unusual going on nobody maybe nobody special visiting nobody nothing going on he said but yet there's just as much god in your heart as there is when you're jumping up and shouting and the church said see it don't have to be a special thing right it's just god moving you with the word of god each service it moves you it moves you into revival it moves all the trash out of her life that your soul can sing the blessings and the worship of jesus christ oh i'm so thankful for god's revival i know i'm revived church i thought why do they do that same reason god has the same reason he put a revive in the ocean put in the lake the water turning up and down takes all the trash out of the water throws up in the bank i think that's a good thing that we have revivals kind of get all the superstitions away from us all the world out churning it out and throw it out on the bank if there's any world in us let's throw it out in the bank today don't keep it in here don't especially don't keep it up here get it out confess it get it out and have revival alive again that's what i told the amen when we went to that church i was so nervous last night it was about six o'clock i was almost shaking brother i was so nervous and i thought wow i need to really uh be thankful for all the visitors that we have like our church don't even look like a church so for people to come in here they got to have a lot of courage so i thank the lord for all of our visitors that we had over the years you know visiting but i was shaking so nervous the more we talked the better i felt by the time we got in there i stood up and gave a testimony at the end of the service when johnny got healed and god gave us our our tax return we waited four months to get our tax return i got it right after i prayed for it i said well thank you lord i can pay off that debt hallelujah just this week i thought that was such a blessing i was able to stand up there see because church the fear will come upon you but we got to overcome that we got to just get in the holy spirit got to put off the old man put on the new man by the grace of god and i remember that scripture paul said i preached it last week we have battles with terrors without and fears within we all battle fear i told brother amen i said that's when i know i'm alive when i'm so nervous i'm shaking inside that's when i know i'm really doing the right thing it's easy to come to church for most of us at least it ought to be but i got real nervous last night because one i'm doing what jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel with every creature if they'll let me i was able to testify i wasn't able to preach but i was able to testify praise god that god has sent a message and the mystery of god is finished praise god and we are prophesying again hallelujah to every nation king your tongue and people that's our responsibility that's the scriptures that's fulfilled today 59 when the brandon tabernacles have revival i want one myself i just don't want to happen the building i want to happen to me i want a closer walk so you can have revival every day and the prophet needs revivals but we already know he's born again so it must be in the human spirit he's talking about moses why christ speak what audit do to us we need a repentance we need a revival i'm saying myself see i need a shaking i need something i said i was speaking to myself this morning or about myself i need awakening up this is less than one month after he preached standing in the gap when brother branham admitted he had a complex and he asked how many have complexes brotherham said every hand went up now i'm not going to ask this morning but be honest if you have a complex you need to get rid of it i hope our church is mature enough where if i ask how many have complexes maybe one or two hands go up but brother answered almost the whole church and he said for that he said that's he said that's how it is in a lot of churches but church why would we want to live our lives where satan has a complex buildup in our minds and we're always struggling with that person or that situation why don't we clear it out we got waves of glory to wash it away brother we got swords of this of the holy spirit to chop those stones down we have all these mighty weapons of warfare why should we live in complexes when we can live in free men free women under the joy of the lord and enjoy the salvation god has given to us why don't we do that we ought to praise god you ought to i ought to like i said there's two or three people i'm going to reach out to this week and these things have come up from years ago i just forgot about them i'm going to try to keep everything i'm going to try to finish all the work like joshua he left nothing undone that's what i want to be one brother called me one brother called me brother brooks brother craig brother cam and brother randy goliaths and goliath and his four brothers and someone gave me the tape of that and i heard it the next week i'm like you just go and you're acting like you're my friend and you just call me goliath so i got to talk to him about that that was years and years ago when i was still going to bible believers there's another situation i better not say too much about that one but uh i'll preach it i'll share it later lord willing to help you out to see to let you know that i've got things i got to deal with too but we ought to be striving to have constant revival with no complexes all right but i said you got a little funny feeling that's a little tiny complex building right get rid of that do something about that now we talked about this with lydia you know she's grown up in the kids if you just have a bad fee a bad thought you don't have to go confess that right if satan just puts a thought in there about somebody you have to go confess that because you didn't act on that exactly right so we the children have great questions i just thought that was a great question oh yeah that's such a i never thought about that because i'm this warrior and i'm fighting all the time and mind battles and battles here battle's there you know i forget what it's like to be the young warrior 17 years in this message uh 20 actually 20 yeah yeah send it start preaching to it right right a couple years afterwards but that yeah if just because you have a mind battle doesn't mean you got a complex or you have to go confess that right you've got to change your thoughts now if you sit said something about somebody on and hurt them and did something then yes you need to go make that right if you act upon the temptation if you get into the temptation remember there's four steps to sin right go to james one this will help somebody believe it's holy spirit there's four steps to sin just like there's four horse riders church just like there's four insects right palmer cankerwood caterpillar james 1 verse 14. there's four steps and where you're just getting tempted that's not sin you have to go confess that to somebody but when the sin has conceived and brought forth then you have to go make it right so there's four steps look at verse 14. when every man is tempted he's drawn away from his own lust and enticed okay so you're tempted and then enticed see tempted if just because you're tempted doesn't mean you've sinned you're not enticed yet okay what's the third step verse 15. then when lust hath conceived it brings forth sin and sin is death i'm sorry i got no wrong i'm sorry tempted is first and end times tempted entice is the first one yes and then uh sin less conceived sin than death there's the four steps just like there's four horse riders church that's why the seven seals are so powerful because it shows off it shows the battle through the church ages but it shows our daily battle right now battling the antichrist spirit i'm gonna get victory over the antichrist spirit today if you are you're keeping those temptations at bay you're destroying the enemy's temptations you're casting them down you're driving them back you're protected by the shoot of faith you are overcoming the holy spirit is conquering not the unholy antichrist spirit so church the four stages lust enticed let me look at it again lust and see oh we're not going to do that i can do that lesson actually doing it and death death feeling that feeling that separation from god okay how many like bible numerology maybe i'll preach for that again no i'm just kidding that's a great that was a great series though that was that's i needed that one that was the holy spirit feeding me okay so here it is so brother and says oh yeah he just said i need a shaking a month earlier he says i cannot go he admits i can't go out to the other churches until i feel differently in my heart about it something's got to change me in my heart if i go there with a feeling i still gotta i still feel the way i ought to have heard that message they ought to have done it i don't have the feeling for the people that i should have until i get that feeling there's no need of me going because i'd be a hypocrite see complexes make you a hypocrite that's right yet you're still sealed in your soul brother you can be a hypocrite and be sealed in your soul yes up here you're a hypocrite in your mind your soul is saying repent you're so saying they're sweet people i love them but your mind's saying i'm not going to preach them i'm not going to give them another chance i'm not giving my dad or i'm not giving my mom another chance no way no hypocrite hypocrite and doesn't do you any good until you get that out of there praise god you won't be able to help them any bit until you get the complex cleaned out of your life revival how many need revival every day brother jesse lord jesus every day i need revival every day brides revival third seal the bride hasn't had a revival yet see there's been no revival there no manifestation of god to stir the bride yet see we're looking for it now now look at look at the context what's he talking about it'll take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again he'll send it he promised it if you listen to the seven seals brother brahms always talking about the thunders connected to the rapture but a year later god had showed him no the thunders were revealed those were the voices of the the revelations of the seven seals so he never talks like this anymore afterwards don't let us tell me your church look at your life look at the word don't let this quote stump you in other words he says the bride hasn't got the seven sealed book yet amen the bride hasn't received the seven sealed open book the book the mystery hasn't been finished yet but now it's finished amen hallelujah thank you jesus the next year brother said the seven thunders were the revelations containing the seven seals this means the bride should have revival but in that context he was no doubt referring to the latter rain or the rapture a man came up to brother ram tried to trick him the man said oh with your experience you should be able to write a bible yourself he said that might be true but see i couldn't do that but look you not one word can be added nor taken away praise god church even if you don't understand the thunders don't worry it's in here it's not out there it's in here and i'll tell you it's in the seven seals praise god because the thunder is a voice of god and every time brother man preached those seals i love it he finished the second the second seal he said that's thus saith the lord amen he just thunders it out in other words that's the voice of god hallelujah that's the thunder of the voice of the son of god that was jesus christ revealing that praise god amen the thunder of the holy spirit thundering it out seven right in a row he said seven days in a row seven days of the revelations of god he's trying to catch me in that well the seven thunders wouldn't them seven thunders blasting out wouldn't that be a revelation give to some man no sir it would be something it would be something added something to it or taken something from it it's all revealed in there in the seven seals opened up that revelation of what that was that's what it was praise god it's still in the word you see you can't get out of that word that's where every messed church goes wrong or anybody when they leave the word of god everything we believe must be in the word of god god's spirit will never leave that word church that's why we need the bible preach more than anything we need brother ramsey's close but we need the bible to praise god the holy spirit will never leave the bible praise god i'll say right with that word blinding some and open the eyes of others i'll always do that and then a few months later have the seven thunders which equals the seven mysterious seals already been revealed no they were revealing the seven seals that's what the thunders was about so the thunders were remember remember the book open book came down to heaven and seven thunders uttered their voices that was the revelation of the seven seals brought to bran brother branham and seven days in a row the voice of god screamed out it's thus saith the lord praise god boy we're quiet on that one so just keep praying about that one church keep afraid about that one i don't know maybe you heard seven thunders other other places i don't know but it's clear to me church it's clear the bride has had revival not because we're eating the book amen we got we got how can we have honey in our mouth and the word of god in us and not be revived we're revived we have all the benefits of the open word praise god well at least i do i hope you do too now look brother adam says in 1964 now this is what we saw last night by the amen all the preachers saying fast pray fast pray which we should but they were saying it and rejecting brother branham's ministry we should receive brotherhood's ministry and say fast pray that's my revelation from jesus jesus said when you fast when you pray when you give alms see why do they do that why do they call for fasting praying and reject they say there's no more revival everybody's complaining ministers why do they do that they want a great awakening they're crying believing there'll be a great awakening they're good people why is that what have they done they have not recognized the awakening of the bride see by being a christian they feel the pull of the hour they haven't recognized what's been done that's what's making them feel that way they know something's supposed to happen they see but we're looking way off in the future when it's already happened right by you glory praise god the bride's already been awakened right by us with the prophet ministry of malachi 4 praise god the bride's already awake she's already revived the thunders have already been been blasted out through the seven seals it's already happened but they're missing it they're letting it go right over their heads in the ninth one's the end time he talks about luther wesley azuza street he said where is the first revival come in the body of christ after a while she come up in luther so the reverse first revival came in luther and then here wesley come along with that revival he says the life went into the shuck you know this the shuck from almost perfectly like the wheat finally his father was made manifest in the last eight or ten years especially last three years now what does it do pull away from the wheat now why now church i want you to re read these yellow words with me okay shake yourself a little bit here shake yourself let's read this together on three one two three now why hasn't there been an organization startup in these last 20 years of this great what this great luther wesley revival leslie branham revival he says they had denominations after luther denominations after wesley he said we haven't had any revival in the last 20 years or so i've been preaching because we have a revival that doesn't end it's the baptism of the holy ghost amen now they had that too right but we don't have a lot of time right so here brother tells us his ministry is a great revival so see you have to take this quote with the other one that proves church we are in revival mode if we're born again praise god this ain't a little revival like ezra wanted come on church this ain't a little revival this is a great revival praise god this is something great god's healing is sick god's saving the souls god is re changing we're re-establishing lives he's he he's the potter fashioning the clay he's molding our lives just to look exactly like the book of acts oh thank the lord visible union some people stumble with this you talk about the character of the women that tells you how the church you're doing so we must have a pretty good church because we have some some real fine sisters that are real godly here today praise god watch when that spiritual bride when she begins to have a revival when she begins to come back to line up herself with the word of god watch then again you see how the scriptures at that time there will be a message sweet sweep out to catch that bride catch that woman the elect this was not his home church and brother i'm admits on tape i don't preach directly at uh other churches like i do my home church so his home church he said the seven thunder's already revealed the bride's awakened why can't the bride's alive we've had a great revival here the other churches he says when she begins to have revival can you catch that church can you catch that i hope you can by god's grace now if this quote's true then every generation has a chance to have revival then people then people can't say well the bride is not revival yet no every generation gets a shot at it praise god this is in the spoken word original see high breeding was started in eden uh covers up here in revelation now that's why each generation has its own revival it gets a chance at the word but instead denominations will hybrid the word but my mission i believe god's called me for is to forerun the coming word hallelujah see the coming word which is christ right that's what the voice said right as john the baptist before run the first coming so your message will forerun the second coming and level had a testimony that he got off the word really bad especially on the deity of christ he got he got off and he had a lot of things bad come out of his ministry uh but i watched a video of him recently i was trying to study on him a little bit and he said he said brother i made him specifically say in his books don't say uh you know he said you have to say uh as john the baptist four in the first coming he said brother branham said you have to say my message will forerun the second coming he said because don't point it didn't point the people to me it pointed the people to the message of god so brother man apparently levi over and over make sure you say the message for runs the coming the second coming of christ the word of god that we're feasting on today how many love the word of god let me bring this down to close i've already preached an hour have i warned you out okay i have okay so let me finish here i didn't hear a no so i guess i've worn out so forgive me that's okay i'm all stirred up that's okay i'm in revival mode you know you've that's that's fine yeah everybody's got their different times and seasons let me close with this here we are eagles in revival brother ram said those four beasts around the throne the lion oxman eagle he said those are thus saith the lord he said those and here it is the bible said they're round about the throne revelation 4 lion calf man flying eagle they worship god brother says but those cherubims are actually sending of anointings as well they represent anointings that are sent as well but the eagle age the last age the prophetic age there's a rise a prophetic utterance to whom the secret always comes but now when it comes forth the eagle age that's the one that god always likens his prophets to eagles he calls himself an eagle the eagle goes so high there ain't nothing else can touch him not only is he up there he's built for that position when he gets up there he sees where he's at some people get up there and can't see where they're at so don't do no good to get up there now we find out the eagle age was promised in revelation 10 7 and then malachi 4. now he means malachi 4. that would be in the last days that would be all right remember the four uh these four uh cherubims also type the four gospels in the book of acts brother man taught that in the revelation series in 1960 and 61. i preached on that a long time ago but it's there if you want to go listen to it the church prophets are always liking the egos look at this is the one believe the sign uh doesn't like when i shared it with them i think i shared it with them god said you've seen what i've done to the egyptians and how i i bear you on egos wings and brought you unto myself how did god bring them how did god bring israel on eagle's wings well here he says later your fathers cried unto them and the lord sent them moses and aaron which brought forth your fathers out of egypt eagle wings so two prophets or two men of god brought israel out on eagle wings on prophetic rings that means god must be jehovah papa eagle praise god right because he brought out his is his his people on eagle's wings and we know aaron was a prophet miriam was a prophet and we sure as you know moses was a prophet so they're brought out on eagle wings on prophetic wings of eagles ah i love that one when the lord showed me that one praise god on egos wings believers renew their strength like the eagle it's twice mentioned in the bible and jesus said believers are gathered on the word of god eating the word like eagles in luke 17 30-37 so believers are eagles and even the gift of the prophet is in the five-fold ministry that's the eagle that eagle anointing is always going to be amongst the bride oh yeah that's it let's stand our feet praise god i'll stop right there that was the other end of my i got through all my quotes musicians can come by the grace of god you can stop the livestream there god bless you live streamers lord bless you in the spirit of the lord hallelujah now
