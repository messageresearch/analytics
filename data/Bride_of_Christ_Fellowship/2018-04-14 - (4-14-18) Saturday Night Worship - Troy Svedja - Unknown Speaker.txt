than I thought a man but it's always always enjoy myself coming to this place amen amen blur jesse is a special man in my heart I thought I brag about him everywhere I go I just he's a I was up in the Yukon preaching earlier this year but brother Willie McGowan his church and I was telling them all about brother Jesse I just say he's a special man to me because he's a man that he lives what he preaches amen amen so let's just as we stand let's just get right into the word of the Lord will open in our Bibles to Psalms 103 I just want to preach a message this evening a terrible time trying to wish to write you know something you travel somewhere there's always so many directions you can go and just trusting that the Lord leads his perfect way this evening amen so I just kind of wanted to preach a message called understanding the loving kindness of the Lord amen so we'll start with Psalms 103 we'll read from the first verse to the fourth verse then we'll go to Psalms 107 Amen Anna says bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless His Holy Name bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all of his benefits who forgiveth all of thine iniquities who healeth all of thine diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowns thee with loving-kindness and tender mercies he crowns us with loving-kindness and tender mercies amen amen let's go to Psalm 107 we'll read the last verse or two verses there it's uh yeah start at the forty second verse we'll start the forty first verse and it says yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction and maketh him families like a flock but righteous shall see it and rejoice and all iniquity shall stop her mouth whoso is wise and she will observe these things even they shall understand the loving kindness of the Lord amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer amen Heavenly Father we just want to thank you Lord so much for your unfailing words father of mercy and grace that you have given us father Lord and you is you prophesied in your word that wherever two or three are gathered in my name I'll be right there in the midst of it and then you spoke even further by your profit by by the st. Paul Lord you said I'll be the same yesterday today and forever slower when you come we know that you'll be the same and we want to thank you for coming here to this little room this evening father though we receive you Lord tonight we give you the highest place though where we give you all the glory and the honor Lord Lord be exalted be take your rest here Lord or as you said the foxes have dens and the birds have nests but the Son of man has no place to lay his head but lord I pray that you have found that place this evening father where you can rest your head upon upon your bride and our we just surrender ourselves in our lives to you and the name of Jesus Christ saying have thine own way tonight well we are waiting to see Lord to hear something from your word because that is why we are here and we thank you Father for all things knowing that you will not fail us Lord and name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seated amen he is the same yesterday today and forever hey man you know and st. Paul made that I take that as a prophecy hey man when st. Paul made that great statement that he is the same yesterday today and forever that means that there's got to be someone and this day in April there's gonna find out that Jesus Christ is the same Amen and then tomorrow someone else is gonna have to find out that's someone that Jesus Christ is the same tomorrow because he is the same every day that is called today someone is gonna find out that Jesus Christ is the same way amen and it might as well be you it might as well be me someone's gonna find out why because his mercy and His grace towards us that's one thing about David is he is a man that understood the loving kindness of the Lord Amen not know if you've ever uh you know I read the you know over and um I suppose see if I can read this real quick over in Psalms oh dear I didn't write it down but over in Isaiah 65 it said something along the lines of my I thought I wrote that down I didn't so well that's alright but over in Isaiah 65 I believe was it says I will give you the sure mercies of David the owner repeats it again in the book of Acts talking about Christ as I gave him the even the sure mercies of David amen and David had mercies that he was sure about amen God had given oaths look think about it Dave is all from the from the very moment that God started visiting him he was just a boy in the in the flocks just a boy is a there we go I will give you the sure mercies of David amen and and just think about is the so David has mercies that were sure in his life think about this man this this boy he started off as a boy there and just tending his father's flock God never failed about to show up on the scene amen he said when the when the lion came to take one of the sheep he said God gave me the ability to take care of the lion they may say when the when the bear he says I took the lion by the beard and he grabbed me he slew the lion when the bear came to take on the sheep he said Lord gave me the ability to take care of the bear and then when the Goliath came he says and the same God that gave me the ability to take care of those the same God will give me the ability to take care of this take the head off of this man today God David as a man I knew that the mercies in his life were sure he knew where he stood he knew who he was worshiping he knew the God that he was serving and he knew that God would always show up there on the scene in his life amen he was also a man that you know how many times something would go wrong in his life amen he was a man that knew that how does live on the mountaintop but he also knew how to live down in the valley amen but he also knew that whenever he was down in the valley he said there you are will be with me right you'll never leave me nor fail me he'll never forsake me amen David is a man when you talk about the sure mercies of David David has some mercies to him that were sure amen he has some mercies that would never fail never forsake him amen so when I when I when I read that verse in Psalm 103 where he said who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowns thee with loving-kindness and tender mercies and you always hear about the sure mercies of David or the tender mercies of David and the loving-kindness it's all it's littered throughout all the Psalms thus those two terms are scattered throughout all the Psalms love the loving kindness of the Lord and his tender mercies because David had an understanding of God's loving-kindness of his tender mercies so I started going back through the Psalms I started reading about those words loving-kindness and tender mercies because I wanted to understand them better and better because if I got if I have something from the Lord I want to know what it's all about amen footsteps is possession right amen so if we have something I want to know what it is amen and the Bible says that he has crowned us with loving-kindness he has crowned us with tender mercies a man that's a possession that he's given us that's something that we have that's something we can take hold up and we can use and it upon life's journey Amen it's so nice why is look kind of researching the the word loving-kindness I'm just kind of going down and reading all the places in the scriptures where it showed up and and just you're reading what what does this word mean yo and as you do you know and you're looking through the scriptures you know and you take the the Hebrew and all that and you can dive down from there to the root word you're just kinda because because we want to know what it is Amen we're like Caleb we're like Joshua if there's something in the Bible that can be ours we're gonna grab ahold of it and take amen so if God has crowned us with loving-kindness and tender mercies let's find out what these tender mercies and loving-kindness is are a mess when I was reading about loving-kindness is it was it was like when a man when he has loving kindness towards someone it's like when he can badly can condescend down to someone who was lower than himself a man he can go down and pick that man up and he can put him up on right here up and so they could be equal so they can be side by side and and that man may not even be deserving to be there but the but the one man who has loving kindness upon someone it'll grab that man and pull him up from where he is and it'll set him by his side he'll Kucera flesh of his flesh bone of his bone amen was one God crowns us with his loving-kindness what's he doing he's saying I picked you up for where you were a man and I had mercy upon you I had grace upon you and when God says I have crowned you with this Amen this is how we live this is the authority that we live under this is our authority this is our this is our power this is our might this is something we've been given this is this is ours we have ownership of it Amen that God picked us up from where we once were any we don't have to worry we're not down here anymore amen he said that we would be joint heirs with Christ amen he would flesh of his flesh bone of his bone we've been crowned with the loving kindness of the Lord a man he said that we will sit with him in his throne a man he has given us everything that we have need of upon this last journey hey man so I started looking said I went through it that word and when I got down to the tender mercies I started reading it and when you boil it on down to the sum of the root words it had to do with caressing like a said like a like a woman that a child in her stomach would massage her belly with the tender mercies that she has towards her unborn child think about think about the thoughts that a woman would have towards her unborn child think about is there any is there any thoughts of bitterness is there any thought is there anything she can she can blame the child for is there anything that she can point her finger at that child for you know discipline is the farthest thing for her mind you always she's you know is that for all that she's going through with the child in her in her belly but yet she has when she robes her belly there's it's the thoughts of love loving-kindness and tender mercies why because she's worth she loves that child and she's looking forward to a time when she can experience it face to face she's looking forward to the time when she can take that child home amen as that child can grow up in an inner home amen and so when God says I have crowned you with the tender mercies of Jehovah and we Rita also her about the tender mercies of Jehovah yeah it's the same thoughts that a woman would have towards her unborn child these are the this is how God is gonna relate to us this is how God is gonna meet us day by day this is when we get down we go and we bow down at our bedside and pray this is the thoughts that God has towards us when he hears our prayer amen this is the thoughts that God has towards us when we pray when we open up our Bible we read our Bibles and and when God looks down from heaven and sees that we are in love with his word the thoughts he has towards us are with his loving kindness in his tender mercies a man when we take a prayer and we laid the altar where the blood of the Lamb is he is thinking of us through through the attributes of loving-kindness and tender mercies amen and what what can't what more can he do Amen you know okay David is one who is throughout all of his life he always knew the God that he served amen he always knew that the God that he served would see him through a man it doesn't matter how high he was how low he was wherever he was upon life's journey whether it was in Israel or out of Israel Amen God was whipped by his side amen God said he'll never leave you nor forsake you Amen that you always I was a you know think just thinking about like when you listen to the tapes of brother branham's and you get to the prayer lines and and brother Brian will be up there on the stage and Yaya and yeah and you hear him speaking and he's and he says oh and he sees he sees the pillar of fire going through the audience you know one time in the questions and answers someone went to brother Branham a wrote a question they said what is that pillar of fire that follows you around and he says it's the Holy Ghost he says it's God it's not just to me but to every true believer Amen anyway I want you to think you know we think about all those prayer lines and all those things but the same God that has crowned us with blubbing kindness and tender mercies that same pillar of fires here tonight Amen I didn't say back 50 years ago maybe it's just a brother brand had a gift where he could see it Amen now I might not have that gift that I can see it but sometimes like no one he's in the room amen amen I know that you do too amen because there's times where you the service gets so sweet where you know that God is in the room you know that he has answered his word you know because God makes an appointment with us God made an appointment with us when he said wherever two or three are gathered in my name I will be right there and the Missa I mean it doesn't have to be in this church room that could be a husband and a wife a man that can be a husband and a wife and her children where two or three are gathered in my name I will be right there and the mysticism you just gather right there my name I will show up on the scene you make that appointment with me I will arrive and I'll come and I'll show up on the scene and he also said further in Hebrews 13:8 he says that when I do arrive when I do show up on the scene he said I'll be just the same as I always was a man of my thoughts towards you have not changed I have crowned you with my loving-kindness I have picked you up from the dirt from where you were I have washed you were by my blood I have forgiven you of all my son all your sins amen and I have crowned you with my tender mercies a man is just like a woman that loves her unborn child so does my love go towards you amen amen and this is how we meet our God this is how we meet him day in and day out this is the God that we serve this is the one that we pray to when we he says I'm standing there up in heaven with at the altar a man I'm ready here to make intercession for you based upon your confession that whatever you bring before the altar in prayer I'm waiting right here just just make the prayer amen just pray the prayer I'm waiting here with the blood of the Lamb upon the altar if any of my children have a need anywhere that Isle I will hear from heaven and I'll answer your prayer amen because I have crowned you with the tender mercies I have crowned you with loving-kindness a man wherever you are wherever you if you have any knee just just send up the prayer and I am waiting with the blood of the Lamb to make a to make intercession for you based upon whatever comes out of your mouth whatever you confess with your mouth I am here I have faithful to answer your prayer hey man you remember when when Solomon dedicated the temple amen he prayed that great prayer he said Lord if any of your children be anywhere I pray father if they could just come into this temple father and if they come into this temple and they just raise their hands towards the heavens I pray Lord that you Lord would hear from heaven and hear their prayer they said furthermore Lord if they be off on a journey and can't get to this temple that if they be anywhere that if they just turn their face towards the temple that you Lord will hear from heaven and answer their prayer and he said furthermore Lord I ask you step further now if there be a stranger who has nodded you that's whether he whatever religion he might come from but if he be a stranger to the house of Israel but he be travelling front through the land and he comes and he comes into this temple a man he spray puts his hands up before you Lord and he prays this prayer in your temple that you Lord would hear from heaven and answer that man's prayer I wonder do you think that that that that dedication prayer still has authority tonight amen now that now sahlan prayed that prayer for God's holy temple does God still have holy temples a man know ye not that you are a temple of the Holy Ghost don't you know that you are a temple of the Holy Ghost that means that if you are a temple of the Holy Ghost thing God has the God set according to Salman's prayer three thousand years ago I will hear your prayer I will hear the cry of your heart when you cry out unto me you who have been crowned with the loving kindness of the Lord you who wear the crown of my tender mercies I hear I'm standing here with the blood of the Lamb waiting to make waiting to intercede for you based upon your confession whatever is you have need upon life's journey I have given it to you when I give you the Holy Ghost amen I'm just waiting for you to confess waiting for you to pray amen amen yo I'm almost positive there last time I was here I read from Psalms 18 but we're gonna read there again tonight amen I'm sure nobody here remembers it anyway amen so let's let's turn to psalms 18 I just I read this Psalm almost everywhere I go it's all my favorite scriptures in the Bible amen Psalms 18 verse 6 in this Psalm David was distressed he was surrounded by his enemies he was in a bad spot he was about ready to be killed I mean he didn't know what was gonna happen but one thing he knew for sure that God was gonna take care of him amen so why so here he and Psalm 18 verse 6 he says in my distress called upon the Lord I cried unto my God and he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry came before him even into his ears Amen so so David was a man that knew that when he was going to pray into the Lord now he wasn't anywhere near the temple but he knew that he when he when the prayer left his mouth he knew exactly where his prayer goes amen who here knows where their prayers go when they'll affray amen everybody that's been crowned with a tender mercies and the loving kindness of the Lord needs to know where your prayers go when you pray Hebrew says that our play he that the Lord Himself is standing there waiting to make intercession for us based upon our confession Amen where we confess our mouth when we say Lord I have a need of this I have a need of that Lord I'm about my father's business I'm raising my family a man I'm at my job I'm trying to make a living for my family or I'm trying to raise my children or my children going wayward or my children need this Lord I'm about your business that you gave me amen and when that confession what you confess with your mouth it leaves your mouth where does it go but it goes way up into the temple the Most High God where the blood of the Lamb is sitting there waiting waiting for you to make an accession for you based on what you confess hey man let's see let's go on down here in Psalms 18 I want to read the next 10 or 15 verses or show and show you the reaction that happened when David prayed this prayer it set off a chain of events amen one prayer took one verse he said I cry out to the Lord in my distress and my cry went into the Lord's temple and he heard me out of his temple Amen so we get to verse 7 this is God's reaction to David's cry amen and the same thing is available to us tonight amen amen and any night to anybody who's been crowned with the loving-kindness and tender mercies of the Lord this is us beginning to understand the loving kindness of the Lord amen verse 7 it says then the earth shook and trembled the foundations of the hills up moved and were shaken because he was Rothes why was God wrought because someone is disturbing one of his children amen God was wroth God was getting angry because someone was causing his children to cry out one of his turn was crying out in distress and God was getting angry at David's enemies amen amen whoo-whee and we all have any Saints Amen the devil goes about with like an anger like an angry lion seeking whom he may devour amen amen verse eight and there went up a smoke out of his nostrils fire out of his mouth devoured coals were kindled by it he bowed the heavens also and came down God Himself is coming down to earth at the cry of one of his saints amen amen and darkness was under his feet he rode upon a cherub and did fly yay he did fly upon the wings of the wind he made darkness his secret place his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies and at the brightness that was before him his sick clouds passed hail stones and coals of fire the Lord also thundered in the heavens and the highest gave his voice hail stones and coals of fire yay he sent out his arrows and scattered them he shout lightnings and discomforted them then the channels of the waters were seen the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke O Lord at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils he sent from above and took me he drew me out of the many waters and he delivered me from my strong enemy and from them they which hated me for they were too strong for me and God heard David's prayer and God showed up on the scene amen and God is still the same yesterday today and forever when one is says there in date remember how he remembers in Daniel chapter 10 or 11 I forget where it is where Daniel had been praying even praying amen and praying and he and his praying facing towards Jerusalem and he's crying out under the Lord and all sudden angel comes he says after 21 days the angel came and the angel says something that was always so striking to me he's the angel said that day the moment you start praying your prayers were hurt amen the moment you start praying heaven started listening the moment you start praying now I might have taken me 21 days to get here but I want you to know Daniel I don't want you be doubt and I don't want you be to scourge IVs I want you to know it even though it took me twenty one days the answer the very moment you started praying all of heaven was started listening amen and for the children of God who had been crowned with the heavenly with the tender mercies of God they've been crowned with his loving-kindness amen God is crowned and we're sitting up with them in heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen where we're sitting with him in his throne amen and he is waiting for his children when they cry out I will answer as British like I answer this prayer I'm ready to move heaven and earth based on your head on your knee amen amen who has needs tonight amen and God is the same yesterday today and forever amen think about when when when Paul when st. Paul grabbed up his pin he started writing he's right in the book of Hebrews and he got to Hebrews chapter 13 and he kept on writing he wrote it down verse one he wrote down verse two he's writing by what he was he doing he was moved by the Holy Spirit to write amen is now what the Bible says that s st. Paul was writing the Bible says that his hand was being moved by the Holy Spirit amen because as they're the men of old were moved by the Holy Ghost to write saying we got to Hebrews chapter 13 7 he started writing and he got the Hebrews 13:8 he says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen he wrote that by permission he wrote that by commandment that and went out as a prophecy that Jesus Christ every day is that is called today Jesus Christ will be the same a man now I don't quite remember what the day the date is today it might be April 13th or April 12th or April 14th I'm not sure it might be 14th I think I don't know but but so on this day on April 14th 2018 it was prophesied over 2,000 years ago that Jesus Christ would be the same today and somebody has to find out that that's true somebody has to know that he's the same I mean that prophecy has not failed amen and that prophecy won't fail tomorrow and it won't fail the next day it's gonna go on every single person that has been crowned with the tender mercies of God that has been crowned with his loving-kindness is gonna find out that that scripture is true amen he is the same yesterday today and forever amen amen it's just like you know in the they're in the assault and the New Testament is like a grain of mustard seed amen you know and then it says that your prayer would be like a also says else way your prayer would be like a mustard seed amen oran he also talks about the seat though the the mustard seek plant he says when is sown it is small he says when is grown is greater than all things of that which was song is small but when it has grown it is greater amen and then it talks about mustard seed faith also you know but but think about it how many times do we pray a prayer that seems so small look at David's prayer there in Psalms 18 he says I cried unto the Lord it took one verse to describe his prayer a little prayer when I saw no am I've been so small but yet God made such a mighty response to it Amen why because he's the same yesterday today and forever Amen he is just waiting for his two children to cry out a man last heard of Psalms 107 I got along I hope you all like the Bible because I got a long reading here I wanted to read Amen solves 107 it's kind of a unique and unique chapter it's kind of slep in about four or five different stories I'm not going to read the whole chapter by probably will read about two-thirds of it at least amen and so and so about every eighth verse every eight verses or so it's another story and it's a story about lows that discover that God is rich in mercy and praising God for delivering him out of whatever it is that they were going through amen so let's go to Psalms 1:07 will will read the first nine verses here and stop this is talk ulis part the first nine verses here is talking about those that were redeemed out of Egypt amen now they were in bondage they were suffering amen they had a promise that God had given to Abraham but they had not quite realized their promise yet and all sudden God delivered them out of what they were going through and getting to them into their promise they meant and it says what's almost everyone says o give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever let the redeemed of the Lord say so whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy and gather them out of the lands from the east and from the west and the north and from the south they wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way they found no city to dwell in hungry and thirsty their soul fainted in them but then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble and he delivered them out of their distress he led them forth by the right way that they might go to a city of habitation oh that man would praise the Lord for His goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men for he satisfies the longing soul and filleth the hungry soul with goodness amen God heard their cry they are wandering in the wilderness and what they do God heard their cry so they said oh that man would praise the Lord for His goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men amen now this next this next chunk of Scripture here next 10 verse 8 verses or so he has a little story about those that are bound by sickness and are in prison amen starts in verse 10 and it says such as sit in darkness and in shadow of death being bound in affliction and iron because they rebelled against the words of God and contemned the council the Most High therefore he brought down their heart with labor and they fell down and there was none to help but then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble and he saved them out of their distress he brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death and you break their bounds bands asunder oh that main would praise the Lord for His goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men for he have broken the gates of brass and cut the bars of iron and sunder a man how remembers in in Isaiah 65 he said the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me hey man he's annoying to me to break them out of the prisons he's anointed me to heal them they're blind he's anointed me to bring them out of prison he's annoyed to mean it healed in the sick why because the Spirit of God when he comes this is what he does Amen when the Spirit comes he heals when the Spirit comes he delivers when the Spirit comes he says freeze and oh that Mainland praise Him amen this next this next few 8 verses here talks about men that are fools men they ought to know better but do something anyhow Amen men that know what the word says but they can't quite find themselves to obey the word Amen or other or they're just not intelligent or they're just not or just they're foolish men and how the mercy of God goes out to them still even amen we who were not worthy God has made us worthy a man says start earn-in in verse 17 fools because of their transgression because of their iniquities are afflicted their soul abhor athough manner of meat and they draw near to the gates of death then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and he saves them out of their de-stresses he sent His Word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions oh that men would praise the Lord for His goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men let them sacrifice the sacrifices of Thanksgiving and declare his works with her joy see oh that men would praise the Lord for His goodness and his wonderful works of it a man we ought to worship Him he's crowned us with loving-kindness until even when we weren't worthy amen III think God Yahweh this the times that God has heard my prayer when I was even worthy of the times I worship in the most Amen the times when I know I don't deserve it and yet God still answers my prayer or still shows up on the scene or still shows up when I pray or still shows up when I worship even when I know I don't even deserve it that's what causes me to worship Him the most hey this next section will be the last section we read but I was talking about men that are in boats when they're when they're surrounded by water and their only hope is in the boat that they're sitting in and when their boat begins to fail that they turn to the Lord amen it says verse 23 they that go down to the ships go down to the sea and ships that do business in great waters these see the work of the Lord and His wonders in the deep for he commandeth and raises the stormy wind which lifted up the waves thereof they mount up to the heaven and they go down again into the depths their soul is melted because of trouble they reel to and fro and stinger like a drunken man and are at with their wit's end then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and he bringeth them out or distress he maketh the storm a column so that the way is there of our still and then they are glad because they be quiet so he bringeth them unto their desired Haven oh that men would praise the Lord for His goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men because he brings brings them to their desired Haven hey man I don't think there's a Christian out there right now that does not have a haven in mind that they'd like to get to a man because Lourdes promises a place of rest a man where we are no longer resting upon our works but we are rested upon the Holy Spirit of the Living God a man that we go through our times of troubles but one thing we do know for sure that our God is with us every step of the way hey man we might go through times where we are poor we might go through times where we were rich oh my go times where we were sick or at times where we're well but in all things we give our thanks and our praise to God it repeats over and over again and the scripture says old that main would praise the Lord for His goodness and for his wonderful works and the children of a mint to its owner mint because it's not that they don't go through troubles but that our God will deliver them out of every single trouble Amen God got the law God will deliver his children out of their troubles and when it comes down to the end of this chapter it comes down to the verse that we read there a little bit ago starting there with verse 42 it says the righteous shall see it what do they see they see every single thing we just read they're the righteous we'll see how men how God is always about delivering men out of their troubles the righteous will see it and rejoice and all Nikoli shall stop her mouth whoso is wise and will observe these things even they shall understand the loving kindness of the Lord that's kind of what I just wanted to get through get over tonight is the understanding of the loving kindness of the Lord that no matter where you are upon life's journey whether you're 5 years old or 15 years old or 25 or 35 fourth hour old you are that God knows what stage of life you are in amen he knows whether you're a child growing up he knows whether you're a teenager or going through the struggle as you change your change of life you know he goes when you're 25 you're starting a family you know when you're in your 30s and your family is maturing and your 40s here you for your family or children are leaving and you're entering into a new stage of life without sure God knows every single stage of your life he knows the temptations that you go through amen and but you don't want things for sure that God wrote our names upon the Lamb's Book of Life amen if God has called you if God has revealed to your name that your name is written upon the last book of life if God has as when God starts drawing you take that drawing and put it in the bank amen that the very God that has began to draw you will see you all the way through the very God from the first time he began showing up at your heart's door and when the very first time he starts drawing you remembered always remember that that God will see you through all L of your life amen I have been you know it's it's you know got Christ met me 13 years old amen and and now I am now 38 so it's been was that 25 years and I and I have never seen God fail me a minute through all my teen years all the struggles I would God was there amen every single thing I went through as a teenager God was there in my 20s all that I went through my 20s God was there now my thirties everything I've gone through God has been there God has been with me every step of the way amen I see it and I understand now the loving kindness of the Lord that my God will see me through why because he knew the struggles I would go through with the day he chose me amen the day that God started drawing me the day that God started knocking on my heart's door he knew every state mistake I would make amen but it's just like you just like I've said a long time ago you know that that God will not sentence his children to life in prison a man we might go through this or go through that but God will never sentence one of his children to life in prison he might correct you he might chastise you but he has in mind that he's gonna bring you up he's gonna bring you up out of the mud out of loving-kindness and set you up on it by his side amen so you could sit with him in his throne amen so that you can be about your father's business once more Amen that's where Christ is trying to draw us to amen so the wherever the Holy Spirit lead us that we can be about our father's business amen amen because he is the same yesterday today and forever amen you know Jesus you know and he well he went up to the tenth the tablet to the tabernacle that was a tabernacle that one day and he and he and he stood up to read and he went and he grabbed the scroll of Isaiah I mean turn or to Isaiah chapter 61 and all the eyes were watching him to see what he would say and he stood there and he started speaking he said the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me and on top until that time never had a man stood in a tabernacle and read that scripture with the full authority that this man was reading amen the many times that scripture men read but had never been read with the authority that was being read at that time a many faithful priests had stood up at the at the front of the tabernacle and said this morning we are gonna read from Isaiah 61 and here they go through and they'd start reading and but but none of those men could actually say that without the assurance that the Spirit of Lord God was upon them but at this time a man sit up with the full authority he stood up knowing that the words that he's saying or for him to speak he stood up there knowing that what he was speaking was not just reading out of a book but what he was speaking was gonna be manifested amen there's like a man when he like rod we sped let there be earth or let there be the heavens let there be a earth let there be light and when he started speaking those things is the same creative word was going on now he said the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the good tidings under the meek he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted he has sent me to proclaim Liberty to the captives the opening of the prison to them that are bound a man to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord amen to point unto them the mourn in Zion to give them beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness a man slew they might they might be called the trees of righteousness amen the Spirit of the Lord God was up is upon him to speak these things out and when he speaks those things his grave now know now what happens when the Spirit of Laura comes upon us who say we have been anointed with the Holy Ghost of God amen who is who have the Great Commission upon us going to all the world that's the General Orders brother Brennan said go into all the world and preach the gospel a man even if to the mothers to preach the gospel to their children to loot their to the men that live their sermons that their work their preaching the gospel where they go to go and preach the gospel why because the Spirit of Lord God is upon you amen and when the spirit of Lord God is upon me was he doing he's anointing you why is he a 19 you he's anointing you to to to preach good tidings unto the meek amen he's annoying you to bind up the brokenhearted he's anointing to proclaim Liberty to the captives the open of the present of them that are bound amen to the acceptable year of the Lord he's anointing to preach those things but and if at any time you find yourself bound yourself how can you preach those things amen but if you ever do find yourself bound if you ever find yourself in prison one skin if you find yourself chained up in your mind or depression comes upon you or or or you can't get out of something what is it the Spirit of the Lord God is there to break those things why because it's it's God's intention that you have this this victory upon yourself so that you can go take this victory to others amen remember God said unto us that he would anoint us to be Kings amen he anointed us to be priests in the book of Revelation is said that we would be anointed kings and priests unto this age a minister and that promises to every single one of us Amen we can we are we're a holy priesthood amen amen anointed with the Spirit of the Living God remember the priests knew how to handle the sacrifice they knew what that blood was capable of they knew what that blood could do amen the priests there they were they were they spent their whole lives being taught and trained how to handle the sacrifices a lamb for this dove for this goat for this a book for that if someone comes with this problem this is what you do if someone comes with this problem this is what you do and we are anointed priests unto our God you have to have the same ability that we know what our poor sacrifice is capable of a man we know what the blood of Christ can do amen and Jesus Christ is standing there at according to Hebrews he is standing there at the altar up and with the blood of his own blood he's entering the holiest of holies we're waiting to make intercession for us based upon whatever our confession is and we have been anointed to be priests and of the Most High God amen priest sent to the unto the unto the oil we're here to handle the Word of God we're here to were the new to handle the sacrifice of the God to bring the blood of Christ to the people amen to let them know what that blood can do amen to let them know what is capable of amen but not just but not just a priest he's anointed us to be Kings also remember the kings were responsible first the priests were responsible for for the for the temple amen but the kings were responsible for the entire land and they could take the authority of that word that was in the Ark of the Covenant and expound it's it's era as air as place of Dominion and and 6-pound at the uttermost boundaries of Israel that the rule the word wouldn't just stop at the tabernacle door but that that rule of the word would go to the so if you're an Israelite who's whose home is at the furthermost geographical spot from the temple I don't care if you are at the point that geographically is in Israel but the furthest point away from the temple wherever that place may be if that's where your home is that you would still be underneath the Dominion of that king and that king has the responsibility of making sure that the rule of that word that was written by God's own finger and the Ark of the Covenant the commandments of the Lord are that the that the Dominion of that word has expound the furthermost boundaries of his a man there so if we've been anointed kings and priests amen we are anointed to take the the rule and the Dominion of this word amen and to bring that to the other most boundaries of our homes or our properties those are the most boundaries of our families a man to bring that to our workplace wherever we go though we are a king and a priest to our Most High God and just like salman's when he dedicated the temple he said that if any man anywhere you'd be a stranger come into this temple and pray a prayer I pray Lord that you lo would hear from heaven and answer him this prayer but we are the anointed priests and we are the Temple of the Most High God so if a Hindu or a Muslim or if anybody comes to the house of the Most High God which are we that we who've been crowned with the tender mercies and the loving kindness of God who being given the the authority to handle the sacrifice could could pray for someone with the full surety knowing that our God will hear our prayer amen that we know how to handle the sacrifice they have even if the man's now a Christians say I know a God in heaven and I and I know that he has anointed me to to bind up the brokenhearted a man to set the captives free and I see it you've been bound by the sickness but the Spirit of Lord God is upon me and he has anointed me to handle the sacrifice and I am here to tell you about the blood of the Lamb about the Almighty sacrifice and what it can do what it can obtain what his power is the power of the Almighty God the power of a resurrected Messiah who is the same yesterday today and forever I'm here to testify that he is the same yesterday today and forever it's our responsibility to bring that to the people so that they can believe so they can when they bring that in they ask you all would you pray for me brother oh you have testified to me you've told me about this Jesus Christ that he's the same yesterday today forever that he'll hear my prayer would you pray for me brother would you pray for me you can answer back with the full assurance of a king the full assurance of a priest that you know that your God is anointed you to be in that position that you're God's anointed you to pray and to know that when your prayer leaves your mouth you know that it goes right up to heaven where the blood of the Lamb is waiting there make an ease money to make intercession for whatever you pray amen Salah and it's no longer but now it's your word what server you say will you pray it'll be done unto you why because you're an anointed Keese priest an anointed king who's been given the authority of the hymn amen so it's your name or so your name is just as good on the checkbook amen my this is where we stand seats we've been crowned with the loving-kindness and tender mercies of the Lord it's not that we have to guess about it it's not that we have to wonder about it but he has crowned us with this amen he has crowned us with his loving-kindness he picked us up for where we were he pulled us up from where we were and he put us by his side he says I no longer call you down here Church church but I call you bright amen I will sit with me a my throne flesh of my flesh bone of my bone we were thought with a blood with the blood here yeah Maya I'll give you my very word in your mouth in your mouth so what you say will happen this is he has crowned us with the Saints this is what he has given to us amen amen it's just that we don't believe it enough we don't put it into action enough or we're not coughed or we don't give out the confidence enough to make others know that we're sure what we're speaking about amen but it's our duty amen it's our duty to have that confidence in the word amen and you only had that confidence by experience try him Saints Amen it's by the testimony say men when when you when you prove when you start laying things upon the altar amen you see God answer your prayer like oh my God heard my prayer and then you can start believing for greater things amen and when you mean God answers that you're like oh my god can do that also a man then you could see gray or things it's like brother Branham he always had that a little story that he preached over and over again about blind Bartimaeus yoni they say blind bartimaeus was sitting there outside the walls of Jericho he was a beggar an Israelite but he was a beggar amen and hewed and he had come up every morning he o to to beg there and he would sit down upon the rocks there that would have been sitting there ever since Joshua is gay they gave out the shout and the walls came tumbling down and the rocks were still laying there to the day bartimaeus and Bartimaeus he'd go there to bang he's like I'm sitting here as a bagger sitting on a rock that fell here at the very commandment of God sitting here as a bagger where God in his power might shook this rock down and this is where I sit begging oh my sitting here begging where the power of God was made known was made manifested a man think we do the same thing when we listen to the tapes amen we sit as beggars listening to the power of God in the prayer line it's no different than what blind Bartimaeus was doing amen and he would think back to all those all those all those Bible stories his mother told him as a child he think about how his mother would tell him about how Elisha you know you know oh oh you are Timaeus you know when you wouldn't you know Elijah we when he was when he was here on the earth just a few miles from our house here he came right down this road here Bartimaeus and he was walking arm-in-arm Elijah and Elijah and they went down to the river Jordan this river right here just where were you go fishing all the time and he went out in the part of the river Jordan and went and God Jehovah almighty you know his servant was tired Elisha from from working all the time and being about God's service and God just took him up a home he didn't have to bring any horses God provided the horses and a chariot of fire took him straight up to heaven a man and Elisha was left behind and he took Elijah's man so he went back to the River Jordan it's just that River you go fishing bartimaeus was that same river Amen the same river of you playing amen and and in Elisha camp and he smote those waters and he said where is the god of Elisha and the river parted and he walked across on dry ground and he thought back to those but as he was sitting there on that rock they've been shaking down by the power of God he's seek him back to all these Bible stories his mother told Amen me thinking about how the story about how it was just a few miles where he is standing that Joshua is after there when they're in Cantor the plains of Jordan or of Jericho that is he us got up one morning he went for a little walk and he saw a man clothed with a sword by his side and and Joshua goes up and he and he draws sorry says are you for us are you with our enemies and the man said nay but I am the captain of the host of Lord and Young Bartimaeus I want you to know that that that man was standing just a few miles from where you were born here at the captain of the host of Lourdes where you play walked upon this very ground and Bartimaeus was thinking about you know if I had been living here in those days that I would go up to that great captain of the host of lore and I say oh great captain of the Lord's host I pray Lord that you give me my sight back yo and he said you know or he'd say you know if I was living here in the days of Elijah and Elisha and I had gone up to you know like if I sit here begging it then that if I saw them walking by or heard them walking by or Haarmann armed as they're going down into the river to part the River Jordan that I would that I would say old great prophets of the Most High God I pray that you give me my sight back and I believe that the Lord would give me my sight back if one of those men would pray for me amen what we do the same thing when we listen to the tapes oh if I was only here in the days when when brother Branham was here oh if I could only get in the prayer line if I could only do that amen you know I've done the same thing in my own ministry when I first started preaching I was like Lord brother Branham you know he could he could go up to a to a pulpit like this and he look out in the audience he'd see a pillar fire come in the room in the center or someone he'd see what's wrong with him he say you sir your name is this and I'd say but Lord what have you given me you gave brother Branham those tools to perform his ministry but Lord what have you given me to perform my ministry because I am responsible for the same people that had the same kinds of needs in the same kind they come with the same expectation that God will meet their needs and God showed me I gave you the word the same exact word amen and really it wasn't the visions that healed Amen it wasn't the fact that brother Brian saw the pillar of fire the meaner healed he said I just do these things to bring up your faith but when they put inwardly putting their faith in they're putting their faith in the word of the Most High God and God heals them and it's the same thing tonight amen we may not feel in a man we might not feel his presence in the room oh yeah we know he's here because he made an appointment with us 2,000 years ago he said where you are where two or three are gathering my name I'll be right there in the midst of it hey saying when you gather in my name and you know when you gather I will be just the same as I have always been amen just the same as when I walk down into this tabernacle here one time that when Jesus was in a house that they all Sun the ceiling tiles moved aside and a man came down as they tore up the roof to let a man down and is the same God this year right now a man we might not have to tear up the roof but he's the same yesterday today and forever and he's standing there with the blood of the Lamb amen waiting for us to make a confession to say lord I know that you're the same I know that you haven't changed one bit Lord I got this need in my life lord I need this lord i love you lord he has crowned us with his loving-kindness he is crying us with her tender mercies amen he is just waiting for us to make a confession amen amen amen it's just like you know when the when the woman was the alabaster box when she took she took all that she had she gave her all into it amen she gave everything she had to buy that alabaster box and when she went into into Simon the Tanners house and she went into that room and and and Jesus was there in the corner and he was sitting there with dirty feet and and they weren't giving Jesus the preeminence that they ought to have amen amen we've all been in church services where maybe you know or in places where Jesus wasn't being given the preeminence that he ought to have had a man but it only took one one person gave him the pre-meds one person gave him the primettes and when she went up to Jesus and and no one was paying Jesus knee attention you stand there being unloved - unwashed unkissed you know his feet were dirty you know and all that all is all he had suffered the the rejection you know of not being accepted by the ministers of that day and as all the high and mighty were sitting there and there as Jesus not being welcomed that one made him welcomed one made him welcomed and when she went up to him that then all eyes were upon him to see what she would do that she broke open the alabaster box and crying she started anointing him and in washing his feet with her hair and all of a sudden that in the midst of that all sudden everybody in that room was in the midst of a worship service amen but only two could actually enter into that worship service Christ and the woman amen and everybody else was sealed outside of the worship service amen stolen the time of true worship came to beam what is it he is right there in the midst of them just like we are here tonight amen and any of us you know I don't know well oh well I trust we all came here with the right for the right reasons I trusted it you know we're just a small crowd were humble folks I trust me I came for the right reasons but every single meeting we have an opportunity to be like that woman it only takes one Amen it only takes one when one person gives him the preeminence when one person begins to worship and with a true heart of worship when one person enters in all sudden when that worship service starts it's a thing the thing is sealed amen amen and many are sealed out and many are sealed in amen but we ought to approach every service so we can be like that one with alabaster box and we are the ones those are the ones that have their prayer answered those are the ones that he says whatsoever you ask in my name I will do it Abyan because i have crowned you with my tender mercies amen why because she layer sealed into the worship service amen there is to a woman and her Lord Amen and he is the same yesterday today and forever Amen you know over and over in a Isaiah 62 you remember how it says there is talking about Beulah land hey man you remember the scripture is that it's a it's Isaiah chapter 62 verse 4 I'll read it here and it says thou shall no more be termed forsaken neither shall thy land be termed desolate but thou shalt be called hepzibah and I'll and shall be called married a man and I was looking at that a while back and I thought about I took those words and just you know for the homeschooling crowd here you know for the when you go down into your English lessons you learn about antonyms and synonyms amen because you you know when you the were an antonym is it's an English word so when you take a word like forsaken the word forsaken has antonyms and there are words that means something completely opposite of what the word forsaken so the word forsaken has a lot of different meanings but each of those meetings have antonyms that have opposite meanings amen so when God here said that you will no longer be termed forsaken amen and your land will no longer be called desolate then that means that whatever those antonyms are that we get whatever the opposite is amen because we're no longer be gonna be called Forsaken we're no longer gonna be called neglected we're no longer going to be called desolate amen but instead we're gonna be called whatever the antonyms of those are that's what we get amen amen joy said in Psalm versary says it said thou shalt no more be termed forsaken neither shall thy land be term desolate but thou shalt be called Hepzibah and I'll and boola for the Lord delighteth in me and I'll and shall be married a man so the antonyms of forsake and he said there for you shall no longer return forsaken it says the the antonyms are forsaken are cherished we will be cherished by the Most High God we will no longer be called those that are forsaken but we called those that are cherished another antonym has helped will be those that are helped by the Most High God will be those that are nurtured by the Most High God will those that will be wanted desired amen Christ desires to nurture us He desires to cherish us he designs not just he desires but he does it he actually doesn't he performs us why because we're no longer called forsaken amen what were past that we've been given over that amen and your land will no longer be called neglected but it'll be the antonym of neglected is cared for considered Amen cultured brought up Amen heated or used to you know you're one that you're helpful in the kingdom Amen your land is no longer called neglected but now it's being nurtured and you're like a tree planted by the rivers of living water amen hallelujah amen your land and long we call desolate amen may be cultivated it'll be populated it'll be used I mean you won't be devastated he more will be built you'll be constructed you'll be enriched you'll be helped you'll be improved upon from where you once were a man why because here you go from glory unto glory unto glory why because you've been crowned with loving-kindness you've been clowned with a crown with the tender mercies of the Lord amen amen they says there you know the it says there I shall be called Hepzibah and there alliant Beulah now Hepzibah means my delight is in her I mean I delight in her and he says that your land will be called Beulah which is married now if those we don't take the antonyms because that the antonyms aren't given to us we take the synonyms which a synonym is something that means the same thing amen so we take these words delight and take the words married and one of the synonyms of delight and married he says that my delight is in her the light means contentment he is contented in us amen he's contented to be with us amen ecstasy which is like bliss or complete euphoria Amen complete contentment amen enchantment he's captivated by he's in trance place he can't stop staring at us he watches over us amen his delight is in us amen pleasure he takes pleasure in us and the things that we do when we were about our father's business he takes pleasure and watching us being about our father's business or just being about us rapture extreme happiness delight or delight in us amen he's enraptured with us amen satisfaction a man just like father said this is my son and who I am well pleased that same thing has now transferred into us these are my sons and daughters who I am well pleased a man this is my bride and who I'm well pleased to dwell in amen amen and the antonyms of the word married I am allied with Amen partnered with Amen conjoined with a man I had become one with Amen he is married with us amen amen he has chosen us now he is his choice he took us he is the one that picked us up amen he made his choice when he started calling it your heart's door way back way back when he first saw her drawing you I don't know how old you were really were a teenager in your 20s or whenever was when he first saw her drawing you he knew exactly who you were he exactly what you would be he knew exactly where you would go upon all the life journey he saw the end from the beginning amen and he made the choice they'd like brother Brown said every man when he checked when he makes his choice he has to choose carefully the type of man that would make him a good wife amen when God began considering before the foundation of the world who would make a great great bride for him he chose you amen he chose you he chose you he chose you before the foundation of the world he started thinking who will make a bride for me upon the earth who will make a bride for me he says I know okay little Jesse amen amen I'll pick brother Jesse and I'll take I'll take Malachi over there I'll make him a part of my bride I mean I'll take Kristen over there I'll make him a part of my bride amen amen he he chooses us he chooses us why why did he choose us because that's the character I'm looking for that's how I'm gonna I'm gonna race her up I'm gonna race him up and they will go from glory unto glory unto glory amen and just think we're not even all the way through the journey amen we haven't even finished our journey yet I have not seen nor theair consider what has what he has in store for the children of men oh my old that children would thank him and praise him for what he has in store for the children of men amen oh the children men would praise him for the things he is that brought us through a man God is good to us isn't he Saints amen III steal you get to the point in life you know we're you know you you it's just like a marriage you know when you when you first get married you know you don't really know each other yet you only know each other's capable if you know like my wife says you know I like to remodel houses and we've bought and sold a couple of different houses and I I'll buy him I tear them up while we're living in them and my poor wife we've bought and sold three houses each one we've tore apart while we were living it and and and and fixed it up and then sold it and use whatever money make to buy the next house and you do that and then you use that money and buy the next house and when our fourth house no and and I've and I told my wife I was like this house I'm not going to do that to a man we're gonna buy it we're gonna accept it just as it is after after 15 years of remodeling we're getting a little tired it's getting a little old amen but you know she's she said you know when you first started remaining houses on you destroyed our bathroom but then you fixed it up at the end I was ten times better than it once was I was nervous and scared at first but then when I saw what you were capable of now I'm not so scared anymore because I know that you'll fix it up in the end amen and you know it's just like you know when like when you get a job and you you meet your boss for the first time he doesn't know what kind of worker you're gonna be you might be someone that goes and sleeps in the closets or or whatever you know or or hides every chance you get when no one's looking or or you might be those that when always watching you still if you see piece of garbage on the floor you pick it up aim in here or you're you know you just don't know matter what you're always about you're your boss's business amen whatever it is what's good for the company you have it in your mind and after when you're first get a job your boss doesn't nobody can trust you with but after so many years on the job then your boss begins to know I can trust him in this I can trust him in that you know and we've been Christians long enough most of us been Christians for a long time we've been Christians long enough that we know what our God is capable of doing a man we've seen God interact in our lies enough we've seen him heal our children we've seen him deliver us we've seen forgive us when we're at our worst we've see him love us when we were all the way down here we've seen him how he can pick us up and deliver us we see the joy that he has brought us through we come to the worship services or when he meets us at our root in her rooms we pray or when he when he when we go and he pray and he goes and he shows up on the scene you know when we feel his presence coming to the church he constantly meets us and meets us and meets us but now we trust him amen we believe in him that we know no matter what it is we know that he has our bed mr. Hartz amen you know I was like I preached a while back on the songs that we sing amen you know we sing just a closer walk with thee granite jesus is my plea we all be at people that know that when we sing that song that God is gonna answer our prayer amen that if we sing there on Sunday that come Monday that we all have the faith to believe that by Monday that we're gonna have a closer walk with the Lord Hey otherwise why are we seeing that song in the first place amen amen because our God is so good to us that we know that he has a hearing our prayers I ask iwata God here in closing that's that's when he says that his tender mercies as loving-kindnesses towards us we're not alone in this life he knows every single part of our life he knows the things that we we wish would change he knows the things that trouble us the most he knows the things that we wish we could be delivered from he knows the things that we wish we could get deliverance from with the things like Laura why do I always mess up here or why do I always fail here he knows those things he's been aware of those things way back when he first chose you but yet his loving kindness as tender mercies is still here amen and the Spirit of the Lord God is upon you to break forth to bring forth the captives as we read in Isaiah 61 to set the captives free to deliver to set free to to heal to bind up the brokenhearted so if your heart is broken tonight he said he was the spirit of more guys here to bind that up a man he doesn't desire that you live down here all that but but but the the the you would be in and always in the always in the method that whatever you're going through you know it's going to be healed that whatever trouble you're going through you know that God knows and he's going to answer your prayer that the prudent that the answer is always on its way as he rose talked about Daniel chapter 10 Daniel started praying 21 days later God showed up on the scene and when God show up on the scene he said the moment you started praying I started listening it might have taken me so long to get here but the very moment you start praying I started listening and God is the same way in our homes and our families at our jobs and everything that we've laid upon the altar we've put we've put I got you know I tell you I got a lot of prayers upon the altar right now I got a lot of things I got all the things that God has answered that are in the past I got a lot of things in the future I'm waiting for an answer but I don't I don't trouble I don't forget don't worry I don't fear because I know that my God will deliver me I know that my God will bring me through whatever problems I have in life I know that my God will bring me through on the other side amen because my God loves me and he loves you amen he has crowned us with his loving-kindness he has crowned us with these tender mercies and just like David when we get to the end of our aid end of our days we say God was with me every step of the way amen amen so don't get don't worry don't get discouraged don't fear you say why am I at this point in my life God knows the end from the beginning why am I here you sometimes you think oh I just can't wait to this phase of life is over you know God will see you through every step of the way just trust him believe him he'll always be with you somebody said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you as the Lord told brother bran once he said don't you worry don't you fear to go anywhere or do anything because they're never failing presence of the Lord Jesus Christ will be with you everywhere you go the Lord gave that to brother Branham the same Lord gave that to you and he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you I'll be with you even to the end of the age that same thing that he told brother Ram is for you amen don't you worry - whew don't you fear to go anywhere or do anything for the never-failing presence of the Lord Jesus Christ will be with you everywhere you go and that same promise as to us tonight a man let's just stand amen he's the same yesterday today and forever every day is called today the Lord will be the same he loves us he adores I see he watches over us well no longer be termed forsaken will no longer return desolate but we were called married we are the one that has chosen to be with amen amen he chose us before while we were yet sinners he died for us amen he chose us when we couldn't do anything for ourselves but just like a mother's love toward an unborn child he chose us while we were yet in her sins amen he says I chose you I raised you up and I brought you to where you are and I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you but I'll always be with you in every step of life's journey amen let's just bow before the Lord and prayer
