Psalms I'll be heard in the scene Lourdes or speak to us through thy word or as we look did I word that's just a race I think our Father this morning here like to continue on this lesson honor the series on fear this morning by the grace of the Lord and I got numerous quotes and scriptures we're looking forward to preaching on practical relation 118 we'll just read this familiar scripture here revelation 1:18 [Music] start with revelation 1:18 revelation 1:18 I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death let's go to numbers 33 verse 52 like to combine that thought with numbers 33 52 and like to preach a little message on driving out all the inhabitants like to preach no message on that this morning for communion numbers 33 52 if you're there say Amen let's read it together one two three then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their pictures and destroy all their molten images and quite plucked down all their high places a look at 53 and you shall dispossessed the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein for I have given you the land to possess it amen this bar has a word of Prayer if you have a need on your heart somehow make it known unto God maybe by the lift in the raising of your hand have any father we love you again this morning take this word lesson out to us though we always look forward to hearing what you'd tell us Lord when we gather in your mighty name Jesus thank you for your strength Lord the power Lord God to keep us Lord there's power being kept from the enemy Lord and we thank you for that power how great is your power how great is your love how great you are this morning Lord may we yield to thy spear Lord Jesus help me to yield how many get completely out of your way and may you be glorified and your children in Jesus Christ name Amen god bless you maybe later we'll have some slides uh-huh but I don't have them ready but don't think I'll put them up there right now [Music] you can switch over here I just want to review real quick from Wednesday and that was a real blessed time as we looked at the effects of fear and hope you've been enjoying the the lessons on fear praise God and I was texting a brother yesterday he said oh yeah we preach on that last year and it was such a blessing to the church and hope the same is true for our church amen hope it's been a blessing to hear the Word of God about fear now remember you and I are not given fear by God it it lays in our members I think Helen and I talked about it last time we have an automatic fear in our in our bodies and in our minds because we're human we're sinful we run a falling condition so many times you know you'll have a natural fear reaction but it depends what you do after you have that fear what's your decision after that that we'd say that bursts of fear what's our decision after that do we choose to feed that fear and let that fear overtake us or do we choose to cast that fear down and I think as believers I think we we can all agree that we're commanded to cast any fear down the Bible said that we must take the spirit of love power and a sound mind aren't you glad for love of God this morning now Wednesday we looked at different things the effects of fear we looked at how fear proves you actually don't believe the Word of God and the example is from Deuteronomy about the children of Israel when they got to Kadesh Barnea and they said all we're just grasshoppers there's no way we could we could possess the baptism of the holy ghost there's no way I could live that there's no way I could do there's no way I could overcome these trials when they said that Moses said later it proves you didn't believe the Lord your God so they got to the spot where it proved their fear proved they didn't believe the Lord also we saw that fear keeps people out of their inheritance which ties in with the first thought you know about Israel and fear will keep many people from doing what God's called them to do keep them from being a real godly father or mother or maybe a preacher or maybe a deacon or maybe a trustee or maybe whatever God's called them to be maybe a speaker in tongues maybe one who prophesize one who prays for the sick fear will keep someone from their calling in life fear is ultimately selfish we saw that with Gideon's army Gideon said everyone that's a fearful leave and instead of hanging you know with the group and saying well I'll die with you brother you know if you go out there and the minions defeat us out late I'll pour mile spill my blood with you instead of doing that they were so selfish twenty-two thousand left their army so fear is selfish and it causes someone to be isolated because those 22,000 isolated themselves from the real move of God the message of the hour we'd say the army of God and fear then we saw make somebody useless in God's army they can't they can't do anything for God because of fear all because they're scared and fear actually brings on what we are fearing it's prophetic right because there's power of death in the tongue but also life Peter sink in the water was one example fear brings on what what we fear Joe what Joe fear came upon him Joe bus I've always been fearing off I ever lose my money oh I think one day I might lose my children or something like that and whatever he feared the Bible said it came upon him yet God saw him perfect through the blood of the sacrifice thank God for that and then we saw how this the last one here fear Lau's send us spread in the church because bishops are called to false teachers and then a little leaven leavens the whole lump so many times if if a church is just afraid to confront somebody about their fear or their sin or something that will spread out in the whole church well we're scared to approach the pastor he preached the false doctrine but we're scared to approach him well that will cause fear to spread or if I'm scared approach so and so well this person's a real heavy tithe payer or this person's a real popular person the church boy I don't know if I could remove them out of their position or something like that that fear will spread in the whole church like leaven and so real love of God has no fear fear feeds racism there's a lot of talk right now racism I think the media pumps it up to more than what it actually is I really don't think there's that much racism going on I just think it's a really small groups and remember the meat is always trying to get money to get people to watch their shows and advertisement so they put on their the worst news right they don't put the good news on there so I think they're making it bigger than what it is but but because of the impact of media that can spread Peter was great racist we say he's segregated himself from the Gentiles one time and the Bible said that's because he feared the Jews so the spirit of fear will cause people to segregate themselves away why I don't want to spend time with them they're not as holy or they're not you know they're not as good as us or I don't wanna lose my fellowship with that church so I won't fellowship with that church cuz that brother has it against that brother you know all kinds of racism and segregation divisions we'd say we saw how fear makes someone useless and guy okay that's just okay I must know I'm sorry the last one fear can destroy us all ultimately if someone is a fearful of God and we'll get to this later if someone has a fear of God and just is so scared of God you know and they don't have the right kind of fear of God if they have the wrong fear of God ultimately that fear can destroy their soul cuz they're never though never surrender they'll never repent they'll never serve God their heart will be a selfish heart and the Bible calls it an evil heart of unbelief so that will cause millions if not billions of people to lose their souls because they're fearful they have unbelief in God's Word they truly don't believe God will do what he said he will do if you repent and be baptized and truly believe that you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost somebody believe that if you lay hands on the sick they shall recover how many believe that we have to take God at His Word amen that proves of course if we believe it or not as we saw so we want to be mindful of those things now I want to briefly review last Sunday as well those seven nations that Joshua drove out I'm just gonna go right to the highlights and I shared him with my brother cam and he said oh wow where'd you get those I said either got them from their direct Hebrew names or from their the Bible occupations that that these that these seven nations occupied so if you missed it you can listen to it last Sunday hope if you don't listen to it you get a chance to do that so Canaanites were we got there the name we got this meaning from what they were they were the merchants the traders of all the manufacturing the richest people were the Canaanites in the promised land so I typed that to the love of money and then next was the Hittites which Hittite means a son of Heth and the name hef in the hebrew means dread or fear so that's clearly typed out as fear remember these you drive all these out after you get the Holy Ghost and after you cross Jordan after you're taking the Promised Land amen after you been circumcised they men like the new generation glory amen that's when you start taking on these in a real way amen because they remember many of these are Giants and you never had real battles about Ram said do you get the Holy Ghost you never have a real battle a real one to get real ice a real hard one a giant one hivite remember compromising with worldliness okay yeah cuz the Hittites were the Gibby Knights and Israel made a league or a friendship with the gig and gimme night so this was compromising or friendship with the world and many times were tempted to do that well we won't exactly share with our co-workers or our family what we believe even or it might be like a bad relationship friendship with the world is flirting with the world something like that parasites were the carnal mightiness because parasites were keepers of the I'm sorry they were they dwelt upon the clay and clay represents the flesh and so they were caught in flesh is carnal carnal minded and many people are men in carmell a carnal mind they'll say I'm appalled I'm of Apollo's I'm a Peter I'm a Cephas you know all these things and that's what they'll say today they'll say I'm a brother so-and-so I'm a brother so-and-so I'm a brother so-and-so and they're carnal and they've got a battle that after they get into the promised land girgashites were double minded instability unstable were the girgashites I don't member much on necks I'm just reviewing my rights were the these were the giant fleshy lust the am rights were the last remaining giants of course there were Philistines outside of the land you know that were giants later but these were the last remaining Giants in the land so these were giant fleshly lusts that you got to overcome any time it's like maybe it's a maybe it's a adultery in the in the minds of men right that's a fleshly lust men got to overcome it's a battle the RAM said I the Holy Ghost for years so I and I battled the lustful thoughts had to put a he said I put a cross in my car so that when a woman walked down the street that was pretty I take my eyes off of her and put it on Jesus these are fleshly lusts maybe it's overeating or maybe it's a anorexia you know something like that some fleshly battles that people fight maybe it's battling to try to cut the hair again or makeup or or something like that or brothers being tempted to go back to drinking or smoking its fleshly lusts that war against your soul and then Gebbie sites were the the complexes because that word jab you jeebus means stronghold fastness or stronghold so and that was brother Rams last battle according to Owen Jorgenson when he studied his life he said his last battle that he ever had to get victory over was the complex about preaching to the people so that was interesting that was the seventh the last one very interesting now let's get to our scriptures like I said I'm gonna try to keep this message sort anyhow because we have communion by the grace of Lord and I know people get hungry and everything like that but let's look at this here now I want you to remember this because this ties in perfectly with with our scriptures what actually drove out the inhabitants for Israel if you search the scriptures you're gonna find a two fold a two phone meaning of what drove it out first of all it was God's love and God's promise drove it out so let's look at let's look at the scripture I don't remember this Deuteronomy for and because he loved their fathers therefore he chose their seat after them and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt to drive out nations from before thee greater mightier than thou art to bring the in see the baptism Holy Ghost to give thee their land for an inheritance as it is this day amen so why why did God drive out these inhabitants one reason was God loved the father's God loved Israel remember we went over last week the reason those seven nations had to be driven out because they were so evil God had given them over 900 years to repent and they failed to repent now that's love and mercy God gave you nine hundred years or God God will give us a whole lifetime that's love and mercy Church gotta give somebody a whole lifetime to repent and get things right and if they don't then that's their decision but God is constantly offering the Bible said God is ready to pardon he's always willing to pardon us and forgive us he's ready like the fabi's waiting for you to run back to the father's house amen so it's his love that does this it's his love that drove them out because they were murdering their babies it kind of sounds like America today abortion and they built groves and they worshiped all their gods other than the true Living God in the chapter seven so three chapters later he says it again the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people so other words God didn't look at Israel and say oh you're the biggest nation I'm gonna love you for ye were the fewest of all people now that encourages us God can look at our church this morning and say you're the smallest Church in Akron and I Love You amen because God's not looking for the biggest church he's looking for the church that he made the promise to Amen the one that he loved their fathers he's looking for the seed of Abraham glory and when we have faith in Christ Jesus the Bible said in Galatians three we are the seed of Abraham amen now look here's that there's the twofold I'm sorry I'm sorry I forgot to switch over here number verse eight but because the Lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn into your father's half the Lord brought you out with the mighty hand and redeem you up a house of bondman from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt humming of the Lord it was God's love and God's promise that drove them out what's the Bible say perfect love casts out all the inhabitants amen it is God's love for you and I that will drive out any inhabitant any demon power that we're battling it'll be God's love that does it we must just submit to that love and yes we have a duty we must obey the Lord we must put the Lord first we would not we must not be like akin as we saw on Sunday night last Sunday night we must not look after that Babylonian garments I really like to dress like the world or I'll never like that gold wedge and those silver coins all that money and all those although those blessings of being a sinner no although we must cast that down don't take that into your house and don't bear it in your house right don't bear it in your heart and mind cast it out amen remember because God did the same thing when Israel put compressed past the promised land God did the same thing the first people that sin God killed him the New Testament the first people that got that sin Ananias and Sapphira God killed them it's a beautiful type it's the beautiful type when you get in the baptism Holy Ghost God requires you to walk in love amen he requires all the people to walk in the love and obey and obey the Lord Jesus it's not a it's not a picnic it's a battlefield amen we must make sure our lives constantly line up with God's Word if we're to conquer and possess the land that's right Church that's right now I want you to see this here so what will drive out our inhabitants we remember this of course we just said it earlier here as our love made perfect our love our love our love is perfect when we act we can have boldness when we die or when we go to God's throne that's when your love is complete when you know that you love Jesus so much and Jesus loves you so much that you're in have boldness that God's throne this is what our love is made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world what does that mean that means the nature of God is living in my life as God's nature is in heaven that's how my life is on earth amen and when you see the life of Christ in you when you see Christ living in you in such a way where I can recognize this is not the old Jesse Smith this is a new one amen this is a new believer I see I see my life looking like his life when we can see the life of Christ and our lives that we can say devil I've got boldness I'm filled with the love of God God loves me I love him and I have boldness even if you take my life amen I'll have boldness in the Day of Judgment how many one boldness amen because there's no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love remember as we said last Wednesday this isn't a one-year battle it took Joshua years and years and years to kick out all seven nations it took him years remember God said if I Drive mountain one year then the beasts are gonna take over right the beasts are gonna take over maybe your beastly nature we get all prideful right if he lets you get all the victories in one year your beastly nature your human nature you thought oh I had something to do with this and God said it's not about you it's about me amen I we just yield we just yield and watch God whenever we seen America what happens it's just God it's just us yielding to God God takes over God does it amen it's just so beautiful so how many 1 be filled with perfect love now here's I want to and here's how I remember we went over it briefly a few weeks ago and I kinda short names when my mother-in-law was here on a Wednesday night and it was nice and she was leaving the next day she looked at me tapped me on the shoulder she said I really enjoyed your sermon Jessie well thank you I appreciate that that was happy to hear that you know but we preach on that and and we if we're starting out and we have fear in our lives what we must first do is remember God's love because as the is the goodness of God that will lead us to repent to get the fear out so the first step is remember how much God loves us and then when you remember how much God loves you then you can repent so as first remembers love repent then when you repent you have no condemnation and then you're filled with the love of God when you truly repent that love automatically flows back into your human spirit and then that perfect love can cash out all the fear amen and then now that you're filled off with love there's no more fear now that love will operate your faith because the Bible said faith worketh by love hey Tommy do it church right there that's the simple we say mechanics of it don't you love the Lord Amen have you seen that operate in your life I hope you have by the grace of the Lord repentance and then loving God and then driving out the fear then now faith can operate by the love that we have the confidence we have in Christ Jesus now I want to read a few quotations that will bring this to light a little more I want you to see this here this is how we drive out the inhabitants and it deals with confessing the word how many know we need to confess the word more we must believe the word and confess the word I don't know what giant you're facing today I don't know I don't know what I don't know if you're in the wilderness no driving trying to press in the Promised Land or I don't know if you're facing a giant in the Promised Land but one thing we know is that the love of God will drive out any giant that stands before you it might be a fleshy lust or it might be a spiritual battle like a complex against somebody or an arrogancy or something like that right it might be an indifference just feel like going against somebody you know it might be a temper oh you're just getting hot and angry at this person I know what you're battling but Jesus Christ is here to set you free amen he's here to give you the victory he's here to drive out any inhabitant you're balan this morning that's exactly right so we would see Jesus when God gave Israel the promised land while they were still in Egypt they had to fight for every inch of that land God told Joshua in Joshua 1 wherever the soles of your foot treads upon that I've given you for a possession so footprints means possession some people can just get just barely get to the edge of the land look some people just get there some people just get the sanctification but thank God for it we're not downing people that can only go so far with God we're thankful outside of this were cheering them on amen we're praying for them Abraham was praying and cheering on lot amen Lord save him leave he was desperate for me men birthday as far as you can get with God hallelujah get as far as you can get with God amen but we're always saying that this though that if you want more of God there is more of God for you amen because the worst one the worst place we can get and I want to get to it later the worst demon to deal with is the religious demon which is someone I go to church I think I got it all figured out and my ways the right way that's the worst one to deal with notice I said deal with to try to bring to repentance because they think they got it all figured out they think they know everything they know more than the preachers they know more than the brothers and sisters they know more than everybody that's the worst one to deal with because mother have said that's the one that crucified Jesus when the real word was coming in to try to do a move of God they knew all about it they kicked out people if you follow that word because they knew all about it so god help us not to have a religious spirit but get as far as you can go with God some people can just get barely get to the edge of land some can take the two-handed sword and cut their way through the Philistines and am right so they take the whole thing amen that's what we should do every promise is to us footprints as a possession walk right up and take it God give it to us it's a promise and it's the truth it's for us next one God talked to Moses Jesus Christ is here we'll make every person the building well if you'll believe it now if you'll accept it right now and say Lord I accept it as my personal property I know I have the Holy Spirit I am into your kingdom here I am in your grape variety store and I have a right for healing and I'm just going to walk over here and step up on the ladder and climb up and take it off and come on down and then ain't nobody going to tell me nothing about it because Jesus Christ has done brought me in here and said all these things was mine so pretty you ever seen those TV shows where they give somebody a shopping spree I've seen the ones with grocery stores they'll give him like a one-minute shopping spree you ever seen what do they do Church they take that they take that grocery cart and they just run down the aisles and throw it you ever seen that brother Ram said that's what God has done to us except we have more than a minute we've got as long as we can believe amen glory they said oh yeah I saw the Bueller's one time they were getting ready now I was in there cuz I used to work there but at Bueller's they had a one minute shopping spree and they got all the decorations and they were all excited this person is gonna be on TV they got one minute to get whatever they want I thought my that's pretty that's fine but how much more do we have in Christ Jesus that's what it's like it's like a free shopping spree in God's variety store and programs so you can go in there and if you need healing and it's way up there it looks like it's way far away he said just get a ladder climb up there by your faithful prayers grab that promise I am the Lord and heal the-- and bring it down that's what it's like like at Walmart or Sam's Club you know they have the shelves and shelves and I get low sometimes what I want is way up there on the shelf and it will discourage me like I don't have to call that guy to get that and I got to go cause I gotta get the ladder and you know how they got to do that to make sure they're safe and sometimes it kind of discourages me from one do that but spiritually we should not be discouraged if their promise is up on the second shelf it just means we need more help amen but I'm still in the store this is still my father's store praise God and he's the one that let me in here amen hallelujah I could not let myself in there he had to let me in his store I ran said Satan will start talking to you when we preached like this and the devil is standing at the window of the store and say hey you can't do that or you can't have God's promise you can't have divine healing you can't have peace you can't have that humble spirit you can't have the first love and brother man said this is what you say oh I can't then watch me he says that's right see if I don't take God at His Word see if I don't take God's promise amen because he let me in here praise the Lord run around so when you get the Holy Ghost it's like going into a room and you say there's a piano there's a chair there's a couch and God will use you on different things and that's what he says like the gifts are the piano might be we say the gift of tongues or and the couch might be interpretation of tongues we are let in by God God's the one who invited us in he said whosoever will let him come amen and drink of the waters of life freely praise God this is how we must see the promises of God can you say Amen he said say now you better not so the devil say you better not testify your heel before you feel something ramm said feel something brother I don't feel something I believe something I believe what God said is the truth don't you later he says Jesus didn't say beat unto you according to you feel he said beat unto you according to your faith it's about what you believe not at what you feel it's about what we believe Amen that's right he said oh God til tonight there's not even one of these cases in the building I thank thee Lord for thy power and as I pray as we as your living church tonight challenge the devil will not let any hit Ike or Canaanite or anything else stand in our way we're going forward in fate tonight believing God's Word and that the angel of God is here to lead us Howie drive out the hittites how we gonna drive out the Jebusites those complexes you have to believe God's Word and you must challenge the devil when he comes into your mind that's how you do it you have to challenge you remember with Joshua they just crossed over they defeated Jericho and AI but now they've got to go and they've got to drive somebody off their land and that's how it is we got the challenge that evil thought we've got to challenge that disease we got to challenge that feeling we got to say you know what I'm gonna go get that promise because God told me I could have it amen that's what we've got to do we've got to take God at His Word and believe it amen it's exactly right he said now Satan look what he tells Satan that's how you can talk to the devil now Satan you cruel ungodly spirit come out of the people in the name of Jesus Christ you've got a right to say that to church have faith keep believing keep shutting with God now keep believing keep believing yes he's right by your side the Holy Ghost is hanging right over you right now the first one of you that believes that you're healed stand up to your feet and say praise God this is how brother Brandon did it he said he would pray for the people either sitting and he said now the first one of you that believes stand up and start giving God praise amen he would challenge their faith if we really have faith we're not scared of standing give God praise for it amen amen we're not scared we're not scared to tell everybody he said we got to overcome that you're not scared you got to go forth and challenge them this week God's going to help me get rid of this sickness or God's going to help me overcome this love of money or this discontent that I feel or this fear that I feel or this anger or temper or hatred I feel this week I'm going forward in Jesus Christ name I'm gonna believe his promise I'm gonna challenge that cruel ungodly spirit and I'm gonna get a victory over Satan amen that's how we can expect to get the victory amen praise the Lord he said there was another there's another that's right stand up and praise the god holly there you are God be blessed and God be praised amen here's the wings that was snow-white dub look at this this is quite a situation the Provost said this woman never had a peaceful night in her whole life never can you imagine that I have a couple in a week and I feel like I'm about ready to quit I'm ready to give up cuz I really need sleep and I don't get a whole lot that's my own fault many times but if I say I'm attacted with an evil dream or you know some attack of the enemy I just get so discouraged I get so tired but look he says have faith all of you pray with us now lucky there's a blank spot he's in the prayer line depression and fear I know what this poor little thing she said she's never seen peace in life can you imagine to never have peace how many could you raise your head how many have felt peace in their life and with God look at all those hands you felt peace well this woman comes and she's never felt that can you imagine never felt the peace of God that means she's felt at war with God all her life I never feel right I could never rest I could never have any peace with God I feel like God hates me or gods fighting against me not one time has she ever feel peace in her life now if you just go through a hard week or a hard month sometimes we get discouraged right but we must remember I'm fighting and inhabitant Satan's trying to take my possession I've got to drive it out I've got the power in Christ to drive it out amen now look what he says can't sleep nervous tension later I'm going to show you brother Ram said this feeling of having nervousness and he said distress nervousness and the stress he said is the worst feeling that you can ever have that's why people commit suicide is one of the saddest things they are truly hurting but they've let the demon powers make them feel that way right we can't excuse that and say well that's okay it's a sin it's not it's not it's not the worsen it's not the unpardonable sin but suicide is still a sin because you're yielding and giving in to the spirits of nervousness tension oppression distress hopelessness you're giving into all these things when God is offering and inviting you into a whole variety store of peace and love and power and victory and joy amen he's saying he's saying Adam he's saying bang come on into the store come into my variety store I got peace joy love we'll take whatever you want and people will shy away in fear and think that the only way out the only hope I have is to go and my life now they can still be safe right a person who sins in suicide can still be saved cuz that's what happened to Saul King saw he was still saved he tried to kill himself didn't make it then somebody killed him right he attempted suicide he was still saved but church he lost a great reward and if you're struggling today with depression or nervousness or can't sleep there's hope in Christ Jesus this morning but God is asking you to drive out the inhabitant praise the Lord one time in South America I cast a demon off his sister and it came back in - it was in a few days I think we saw her three days later and it was back on her she was like just all back into that same stereo awfulness and I said what happened to her and they said we don't know she just went back to that that's happened many times happens many times in the scripture jesus said if you cast out a demon out of a house and if you don't put a strongman in the house it's gonna get seven more and come back and then the words the last case is worse than the first so see when when we assert when we start serving God we've got to give everything we've got to God amen if somebody gives up and and gets weak a one time with sin it was I say with drugs like we said last Sunday it'll take him to alcohol then they might get drunk and then that will take them to cocaine and that will take them to what's next you know meth and all these things it'll take them so far just by letting up on one thing we got it's a joy to serve the Lord it's a joy to clean out our lives amen it's a joy to invite a stronger one into your home the power of the Holy Spirit amen it's a joy to have that it's a shame to send though and let's send come into our lives and we should feel a shame when we sin we should now look what he tells this woman here I think I have two slides on this yeah two slides on this look we tell us he starts praying she can't sleep she never felt peace one day our life now none of us have ever had that as far as I know you've never had any peace look what he look what he prays dear God bear me record Lord that I've told the truth how I feel for this little woman I pray God that you'll send her tonight that streak of faith Amen streak of faith from above in other words like a lightning bolt Lord send a spiritual lightning bolt down to this person that knows that you are obligated to your word and you'll keep every word may the God of heaven take this fear away from my sister and I obey you by laying my hands upon her and commending it I'm sorry condemning it in the name of Jesus Christ may it come out of her amen he said now look sister you believe me now if you can start from right here by the cross from this night deny you got it see go on saying I haven't got it no more then it will leave you it hasn't left her yet because God for some reason let it stay on her until she drove it out are you with me Church it was her responsibility you've got to drive it out and I talked to many people like that they say brother Justin will you pray for me and drive off this demon power I'd tried that before and it doesn't happen for many people because they still love that demon so much especially with addictions like drinking smoking or lust people I've had a couple brothers or a couple people lately ask me that and I pray for them but then I just told them I said I shouldn't pray for you until you fully died to it because then it'll just come back or won't move because whatever you love will possess your heart right whatever treasures you have will be your treasures you know if you want treasures in heaven and then you'll cast out everything on this earth but if you want treasure on the earth you'll keep falling in love with more and more sin look at this from this night on the night you got got what tonight you got what deny deny the the war with God and claim peace amen deny the fact that you can't sleep deny that say I can sleep I've got peace denied nervousness deny attention say I'm not nervous I have no tension because Christ has set me free a streak of faith has struck my heart and I'm gonna drive out this inhabitant I've never felt it before but I have peace now Amen I'm going in the name of Jesus how do you praise the Lord so simple you would think what brother just isn't it more complicating that no it's not more complicated than that you have to die to yourself right repent of your sins and then claim the promise of God and drive out that evil inhabitant by the word of the Lord that's right now look here's another one I make this is yeah I think I read this yeah I read this I think I finished with this on Wednesday night if I'm not mistaken Loran said I may go through the hittites through the Canaanites I may have to pass through my own criticizing Lord I'll just keep moving on so see one of the ways to drive out it is to just keep moving on just keep possessing keep believing keep confessing I'm gonna drive out a hittite amen glory drive out inhabitant amen the next one the Prophet said this in 1983 was you here last night when I was speaking on taking the Hittites and the sea just push them out of the way now and go on thanking God for being healed this is how you drive them out you use the power of the word the power of the word the power of the word and Church this is what you have to imagine if you're sick you got to drive that sickness one step at a time I'm well I'm healed in Jesus name or I don't have anger and the next day you gotta push it a little further and keep pushing it until it's completely driven out and now you possess all this land Haim head you possess all this land you might not possess anything but just take one step at a time little by little well I made one day now I can make it the next day the next day drive it all the way out and now you have all this area to praise the Lord now you have all this room all this ability all this opportunity to serve Christ the way you ought to amen exactly right hallelujah that's how I overcome chewing tobacco I just kept throwing it out one day I was maybe it was like this one day I threw it out but then the next day I went and get it I take a step back and then one day I threw it out and in two weeks God knows this is my witness I didn't think about chewing tobacco for two weeks after being addicted for three or four years and doing it every day all day after that two weeks went by and supernaturally God was helping me push it out because I prayed for I'd asked for I'd believe for and so at the end of two weeks I get to this spot over here my my I haven't chewed tobacco for two weeks no way am i letting that demon come back on my land God gave me this land and we've kept the demon off the land for 15 years amen Christian's we can drive it out by the Word of God by the Word of God that's one way to drive all your happiness today you have to leave that door and walk out to your car and you got to keep thanking God for your victory over that it happens if you up and stop and you got to start again right get back on fight him back get get that land back it may go back and forth but you're gonna be the victor if you've got Christ Jesus amen you cannot fail because his word cannot fail amen exactly right now I did I was gonna put another quote there and I didn't have time to get one so remember this quote brother Adam said I'm coming down too close here it's gonna be one of my shortest sermons ever you remember this story by the band told about Jesus crossing the sea Jesus was tired after one of his meetings I believe it was a mark for if I'm not mistaken and the Bible said Jesus wanted to take a nap he want to take it he wonders he was in the boat he said let me take a rest so he takes the rest in the boat and program said that that spiritually he said there was ten thousand demons hovering above the waters and they'd sworn they were gonna drown Jesus Christ that's right because demons hate messengers of light right and so the Bible said Satan you know to control the winds and everything like that and there's all these winds and all this and you remember the story you know before the wind started all this the the disciples were testifying Jesus did this Jesus did that Jesus did that Jesus did that but then when the storm came they got scared and their faith muscles kind of shrunk because they see the storms and they they have to go shake and wake up Jesus they Jesus wake up or if you don't come out we're gonna perish and Jesus said where is your faith o ye of little faith where's your faith in other words Jesus saying you have the same power that I have and the only real all you have to do is speak the word and believe it's going to happen these twelve disciples were no more special than you and I I was studying a few months ago tax-collectors plane fisherman religious zealot you know the zealot thought was the Simon the zealot he was just a zealous church remember in the wrong church you know you these guys weren't anything that special they were just the humble guys and they constantly failed God they argue about who is the greater is vain greater or Loras greater huh who's the best member in the church here they they argued about who was greater they were in other words they were human like you and I are human and yet Jesus looked at them and said if you have faith just to speak the word and don't doubt you could do the same thing there's a Thousand Devils surrounding and all Jesus did was stand up and recognize that he was the son of God amen and the Bible said he said peace be still and the Bible said in just a moment everything departed one time I was driving to pray for my grandpa he was in the hospital in Toledo and I didn't check the weather that morning and I got on route 76 west and church the darkest greatest blackest clouds I ever saw came right down in front of me I thought if I don't go I felt my heart if I don't pray for my grandpa he might not make it and it was right before I was gonna go somewhere or do something I don't know if I was going to South America before that I know remember I had something to do and I just listen to brother branham like this and I reached out my finger out of the van and I said in the name of Jesus Christ I said storm you're gonna move and you're gonna get out of my way and just a matter in a few minutes drove right through it by God's grace I got I drove three hours pray for my grandpa say 10 minutes and drove back and that's one time where I seen something like that where if you speak to it you but you got to believe it amen I didn't want him to die I don't want him to know and he come out of the hospital II thank God for it after that he gave a testimony about coming out of the hospital hey church that's all it's required God just wants somebody who believe his word and speak the word amen ten thousand demons now just a moment I don't have the quotes and I'm sorry yeah I do have the codes just a minute I want to bring this thought out a little bit about demons how demons hang around believers just as angels hang around believers demons hang around believers - this is fully scriptural I want you to read though I want to read something those to you from this is from a message 19:54 God's preparation now the prophets talking about the prayer line now what you listened if you can please pay attention here like I said I'm gonna try to close soon by God's grace brother Ram said he's talked about the prayer line you don't realize every one of you as a spirit there's a body declaring you but everyone's a spirit and a lot of you sitting here looking around you're lovely people I love you and God knows that see but faith is in this first person here this first conscience but when you look up way down in your heart the least little fear will come in there and say well I wonder how this could happen so he's talking about how a little fear will come into our minds and we'll say well I just don't think I could overcome that that's fear I just don't think God could deliver I just don't think today's a day that's fear but RAM said no fear will come into people's hearts and he said and just like that he said it cuts me down right here that I can feel it so but RAM would feel those evil spirits anointing people and they would say well it's just not for me right now he can feel it and then he says it just comes in like oh like a win he does a blowing sound he can listen to it so better I was looking at the people who might believe out there in the audience and he sees somebody trying to believe but then a little fear comes over them and then when that fear comes over he said an evil spirit will blow and go and brother answered I said I'll look over at him and I'll think well god bless the man's heart I know he don't mean that I'll look to somebody else and he goes through all this description he's trying to find people out there that believe but when they when they lose that battle that between faith and unbelief a spirit will come in and start blowing in the church and we know from the other quotes that spirits like to get help from other spirits right because they go get seven other spirits so what I'm saying is their spiritual battle going on right now and we can't see with their eyes but we can feel it with faith now in other words how do you feel how could you feel your seat well you're like you're in the valley decision you're saying you're trying to get the bat you're trying to get the victory that's how you know there's a spiritual battle going on are you gonna believe God's Word am I gonna believe God's Word or not and that's and this is happening brother Branham says this happens just the least little fear will cause somebody to just take on an evil spirit that spirit will start blowing everybody say well bless his heart I've got to go to somebody else in the audience you can read this if you want I think oh and I looked over I think well bless this man's heart and somebody back here say well I wonder how er then he says I need to hear another he said hear now it's on this side and then back here you think oh they don't mean it bless their heart he says then a visions breaking here and somebody sitting here once 100% faith amen so he's seeing all this unbelief but he finally finds somebody who wants a hundred percent faith amen how many 100% faith this morning absolutely they're moving in and you're seeing something here that's moving here's something now that's the reason I try to get to the person first right out to me or something where there be no spirit around it so by the way I was trying to find somebody who doesn't have an evil spirit on them oh my the church we're all trying to have the right spirit on us amen we want to come in here with the right spirit on us even if you're battle you should still come but you should seek God and say God help me to get the victory so can I can have the right spirit upon me he said the least little fear is a demon spirit moving in the audience well I wonder if it could happen today I don't know if it'll happen today now you know your Giants how many know your Giants let me know your battles you've got your battles I've got my battles but our attitude toward our faith or doubt in it will cause the actual effect of it that's right I remember that scripture because if if a man kicks out evil spirit and now he's got the victory if he's not careful if he doesn't keep building up his faith and get stronger in faith then that unbelief will creep right back in Satan loves that keep to leave Saint loves to get back into where he was I'll say like that guys forgive me he loves to get back where he once was he wants his land back see we both are trying to possess land we're trying to possess land for God's glory Satan's trying to possess it for his glory but we know God will get the glory in this church amen it's exactly right amen now look at this here let me just bring this to your mind here I made this yesterday it's really simple you and I are either gonna live in faith or unbelief you and I we're either living faith or unbelief and love faith works by love so we got to have our love and everything cleaned out here by love clean out all of our minds then this love will move our faith to pray for somebody or pray for ourselves or pray for God's will to be done but everything's got to be cleaned out and the church said but see where we battle and where brother haven't said this he said oh poor little fella you know that that's dealing with fear and the least little fear now look let's start down here fear accompanies doubt and of course that was unbelief so we into that a little bit but fear brother the greatest thing against the church today is fear that God won't keep his commands how many can say amen to that I think you've all felt it I felt it I'm a little scared to prayer a little scared to speak God's Word to the situation the biggest hindrance to the church this church any church is fear that God won't keep his word and perfect love has to cast that out Amen you leave that perfect love has to drive the fear out so nobody in here fears that God's not gonna do it we have to believe God's gonna do it oh yes now look at this this is why I said earlier brother this electro quote the worst feeling anyone could have is distress or nervousness which distress leads to like depression oppression I'm just I'm hopeless right hopelessness I feel awful for people that you know talk about suicide it's an awful thing to be in but they don't have to remain there remember in 1st Thessalonians 4 the Bible says we are not of those when people die and church members believers die we are not of those who have no hope we have a hope we'll see them again at the first resurrection hey man we've got hope but those without hope sinners or people that church members that just have religious demons on them that really aren't saved they really have no hope and so they they remain in this distressful nervousness kind of condition and brother brother that's that's the worst feeling to have so the worst thing we're gonna battle as a group is fear the worst feeling any individual can have is hopelessness nervousness distress that's the worst feeling next program said the worst demon to deal with is the religious demon because they're the one that thinks they know everything they're the one that thinks they got it all right and then they crucify and condemn and kill the one who's got it right that's the worst one to deal with right that's why Jesus said we shouldn't worry about proselyting you shouldn't be a proselyte er you shouldn't say well I want all the Baptist's to be come to our church I want all the Methodists to come to our church all the Pentecostals need to come to our church by the Amen know all of God's children need to come to our church do you want everybody be saved yes we want everyone to be filled the Holy Ghost yes but our battle is not against a denomination and trying to proselyte and bring them to us our battles against the devil praise God and we can get victory by the spoken word of God how many believe we're in the age of the spoken word hey man this is the age of the spoken word praise God because the spoken word is the original seed we're going back to the original faith of the Apostolic fathers amen that's exactly right and then brother Simon read this quote and I had I have it on my notes the chief of all demons is unbelief the chief of all demons is unbelief and that's because the demon of unbelief if it's in a person's heart they are not saved they're lost let's read that go to Hebrews chapter 3 in your Bible Hebrews 3:8 we'll go here is 3:8 the chief of all demons is a demon of unbelief and this is what ultimately anoints a person where they don't get saved they don't believe the Word of God I want you to see some of these demons remember Bram even said now the demons have different shapes to write you said ones like a tortoise ones like a bat though they have different shapes that they're in some have hairs hanging down the bat has hairs hanging down from his wings it's awful it's an awful thing but I want to just show you some of these that you'll be aware of this and remember that we are called to dry them out remember in one place in one place I didn't get the preaches but in one place God said I'm gonna drive him out and another place God said you're gonna drive him out what is it it's us working together with God it's us working with God God in us is gonna drive it out hey man we've got to yield to him Hebrews 3:8 he's talking about Israel how they didn't take the Promised Land harden not your hearts as in the provocation and the day of temptation the wilderness when your father's tempted me proved me and saw my works 40 years wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they always do err in their hearts and they have not known my ways so I swear my wrath they shall not enter into my rest now this is Rath this is not I swear in my mercy I swear in my wrath let me know all those that died in the world or something no they were lost they were not saved they were lost because in my wrath they will not enter the promised I just showed him all these miracles I in the wilderness and in Egypt and they can't believe me just to drive out seven seven nations greater than them he said then you'll perish in the wilderness no that's the reality Church look at verse 12 take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God look at verse 3 verse 13 but exhort one another daily so see how much you see how much we got to be together we should try to text each other all the time how many can say amen to that we should try to call each other more we're to exhort or strengthen one another daily while it's called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin so brother man when brother home says the chief of all demons is unbelief don't scratch your head look in the word because it is the chief demon is unbelief because remember your soul either has phase or unbelief anointing it right if you've got faith you're saying praise God you got unbelief you're lost and say God help you say God help my number leave because you don't have any face at that point but God give me faith let faith come as a streak from heaven that I might take the possession today as there's time today today is a day of salvation amen I go to Jude chapter one church what did you chapter one I'm sure the same thing these were all lost because they drew back they drew back they started out with Jesus but then they drew back and that's what I try to constantly urge the church don't draw back from your dedication to God give more dedication to God give more time to God because if not Satan can tempt us to keep drawing drawing back and then if that keeps continuing within what then what happens to the individual they can have some serious soul battles am I saved or not am I you know they backs it in so far now Jude chapter 1 look at verse 5 I will therefore put you in remembrance though you once knew this how that the Lord having saved the people on land of Egypt afterward destroyed them that believe not the God who brought them out destroyed them because they didn't go on with God and that proved they never believed in the first place right but everybody that believed kept going on right Moses Miriam air and they went on they died in the weirdness but they were saved we know that the Bible says that Moses would say we know that but then Caleb and Joshua they were the two that believed it and they took the promised land and brother Ram typed his ministry as Joshua and typed us as Caleb were the ones that faithfully followed Joshua hey man it's exactly right now go to Hebrews 10 I think I read this one a few weeks ago Hebrews 10:38 yeah you know what let's go up and go to verse 35 Hebrews 10:35 we're here I'm trying to finish up cast not away therefore your confidence which has great recompense of reward see we're not supposed to cast down confidence we're supposed to cast down doubt and fears we're supposed to cast down religious spirits nervousness fear we're supposed to cast that down but we know so many people course that have cast down confidence in God's Word well I don't even believe it you know man wrote that book and how can we even have trust in it how can we don't cast down your confidence keep your confidence in God's Word for you have need of patience that after you've done the will of God you might receive the promise forget a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul see we don't draw back like Israel we could never do this we cannot take the promise of God I can't possess it I'm too small I'm too weak of course you're too small of course you're too weak but look who's with you Joshua is with you hm the Holy Ghost is with you God's Word is with you amen look what's in your hand the Word of God there's sort of the spirits in your hand amen we are not of those that draw back unto perdition you see that's the idea of drawing back all right I better closure because II had to communion here yeah let's stand to our feet let's just close right there by the grace of the Lord I got a whole lot more I got numerous I got more quotes but I think I'll just stop there cuz we got communion today by the grace of the Lord now cai-you can switch over here by God's grace try to keep that in your minds church about that try to keep that in your minds now I like by loris if you'll come to the piano here just to play that keep me here the cross but if you can Jesus keep me of the cross they are precious fountain is he precious to you this morning is the word of God precious to you I trust it is by the grace of the Lord why don't we just bow our heads for a minute I just kinda want to talk to the church here each of us are called to possess our inheritance on this side we're called to know our position we're called to be in the duty and service of the Lord and as I said earlier I don't know where you stand I don't know but brother Ram said you can know where you are with God at every moment you can know whether you're just leaving Egypt you just cross the Red Sea just got out of the blood or you're in the wilderness going through some sanctification issues a statue for man or maybe you just crossed the promised land and here Jericho lies before you or AI lies before you or maybe you're past that and you're trying to find your personal position and with authority and power you want to find your position to Authority the Holy Spirit in Christ Jesus how many would want to say brother Jessie pray for me may the Lord forgive me if I've been losing a battle would anybody raise your hand say that so I know how to pray bless those hands praise the Lord let me pray for those first have any father you saw the hands Lord God Lord you told us the illustration I even acted it out it's one because one foot step at a time one step of possession at a time lord I remember in my life I got knocked back a few times in sanctification I got knocked back and even as a Christian I got knocked back as a Holy Ghost field Christian with a complex battle a few years back Lord God and I fell I took steps back in God rather than going forward Lord Jesus father you saw the hands Lord I don't know where they stand I don't know if they're in in sanctification or here they're in the land or they just crossed over Lord I don't know father but I pray be near to them Lord Jesus hear their prayers and may they confess right now forgive me Lord I've been losing the

frees the saw from sea to this water there is that's thank you Jesus [Music] Gracie let's read our text here 1st Corinthians 11:23 for I've received to the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord well that a man examine himself so that and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep or if we judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another let's outward prayer Heavenly Father this morning we're following your instructions Lord you said do this until I come you haven't come yet in a corporal body which in one way we're thankful for because that means you're still saving souls Lord they're still gonna be more that enjoy the eternal life that we're enjoying right now Lord God what a blessing what a blessing I'm humbled Lord by your presence that I feel this morning Lord God you're urging all of us come in my variety store come into my house take any possession you want believe it thank God for it drive out any inhabitant I'm thankful for what you're offering to us this morning and my prayer is that you'd purge every heart and mind Lord that we could be filled with so much love we could possess every promise of God Lord that will leave here possessing the promises of God not ashamed to say what we believe not ashamed to deny what the situation might seem like but to deny anything that disagrees with God's Word thank you Lord bless this bread Lord that we're about to break and this wine we're about to drink we know it's not the literal body and blood we know its symbols that represent your word in your spirit and it's a symbol of what we just did today we feast it on your word we enjoyed your word and we drank in the effects of the holy spirit may we all eat and drink worthily Lord we've tarried one for another we've waited for one for another here we are Lord we heard your word bless your people and all I just pray God our hearts will be made more like yours in Jesus Christ's name Amen [Music] rolls over [Music] [Applause] [Music] scripture says and when he given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do and remembered something let us partake and remember our Lord Jesus asked me not o gentle singers [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] let me read the scripture here [Music] after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do you it ye as oft as you drink it he remembered some you know partake of the wine together let's sing let me out my throne a mercy finest sweet relief kneeling there and deep contrition help my unbelief [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music]

seat see a few songs I need to fill the water tubs with mankind and we'll be right back so remorse do you have any songs if not on your heart I just wrote them down at the bottom they start with higher ground she could maybe shake somebody's hand but we're not quite ready for being washing we'll get ready for at just a moment [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
