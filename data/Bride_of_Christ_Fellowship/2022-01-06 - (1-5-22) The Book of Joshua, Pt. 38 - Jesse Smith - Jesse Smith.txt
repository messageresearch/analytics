christ's name and the saint said amen praise god praise god god bless you let's take our bibles here tonight let's go to joshua 24 verse 31. as i said this may be my last sermon on joshua i don't know we'll kind of see how tonight goes you know sunday went a little longer than i thought it would but it was wonderful to see all the saints come up for prayer so hopefully the holy spirit met those needs and just trusting him to meet all the needs here tonight as well by god's grace joshua 24 31 part 38 it's just been a wonderful book just reminding us about how we must be warriors more than conquerors in christ jesus amen what a wonderful book it's been praise god joshua 24 31 let's all read that one together if we can ready one two three and israel served the lord all the days of joshua and all the days of the elders that overlived joshua and which had known all the works of the lord that he had done for israel amen may god has a blessing just reading his word you may be seated praise god you can switch over hon i have uh some slides we'd like to show here tonight i'll try to watch the time as well you know school night and everything like that and we'll try to get right into the word of god here uh so i don't know if you saw it but just the announcement there we have brother ben norad coming on uh january 16th just one service so i i promised you you know we'll have two months off of just one service and so i'm gonna i'm gonna pay him double for coming i'm gonna pay him like he's preaching too you know but i'm only gonna have him preach one okay so you can rest so really pull on that maybe he'll preach two hours like i do sometimes you know so but that is january 16th that's my wife's birthday too her 25th birthday by the way that's her joke so maybe she's listening maybe she's laughing at home she wrote 25th birthday on the calendar so she was she's a jokester you know so we certainly uh look forward to brother ben coming and hope it'll be a i'm sure it'll be a wonderful uh wonderful uh time remember he had coveted really bad this last fall but god he was near death and god brought him back so we're very thankful for that and he's been a diabetic for years so he was able god really pulled him through you know pre-existing conditions are the worst but god really pulled him through so i look forward to hearing that testimony how god brought him through so i believe that's it for as far as announcements or updates uh yeah in february we'll start back up the two services and the bible studies and genevieve and eden you're next to choose the song so just be ready i'm giving you plenty advanced notice uh choose the songs for those uh those sunday school or you know yeah it's kind of like sunday school lessons so look forward to that i don't have a preacher for february yet i may take it off you know we may i think we need to save up a little bit so i'll try to pray about that i have brother dennis mcbride coming in april though i'm gonna have brother dennis back he has been just been such a good friend and uh every time he comes it just feels like it preaches right to me so i want to have him back and i'm praying about also uh which brothers to invite for our june anniversary meetings you know it's hard it's hard to believe it goes that that fast you know we'll we'll blink and it'll be you know anniversary time as well 16 years by god's grace so i'm praying about that and just want to get the leading of the lord it's been awesome you know when i heard naomi's testimony on new year's eve night and some of your other testimonies about the different preachers that just it does so much to me to know that god put it on my heart to invite the right preacher at the right time because i'm nothing right but i just love to see how it works out for god's glory you know they could have come at any time but god had a certain time for me to call them and work it out and i just love to see god's hand in it you know because it that just proves god orders our footsteps and if we just pray before everything just pray before we invite somebody or you know that's me but you pray before you do anything and watch god just direct our steps that's the beauty that that's that's inquiring of the lord the bible calls it right and that's what we should constantly do pray before every decision praise god so i'm excited you know and thankful and the more i preach the more i love jesus praise god the more i preach the more i want to study the bible more you know and and preach the word of god and you're the best audience i could ask for praise god you're so patient you love me you love me you're patient with me and you pull on the word and people come in here and feel the love of god and that means more than anything to me that means the world to me that people can feel the love of jesus christ and they experience the presence of god here where they may not experience it other places so god bless you let's stay humble let's be thankful but let's stay humble we need god's grace more and more all the time praise god so let's uh look to the lord here uh joshua 24 31 now i have a few main thoughts i want to get to here with this maybe last sermon or maybe second to last i just want to briefly and i kind of did this a few wednesdays ago but let's remember some of these new testament lessons that we learned i'll go through this quickly your spiritual strength that you choose to have will guarantee your spiritual success right but you have to choose each day i'm going to be strong today and when you do that as paul said finally my brethren be strong in the lord and the power of his might well god's might is his word and if we choose each day to be strong spiritually in other words i'm not going to take a day off i'm going to fight the devil today i'm going to fight off that temptation i'm going gonna fight off that angry spirit i'm gonna fight off that lustful spirit right i'm gonna fight off that covetous spirit if we choose to fight it off each day we will succeed and we'll see the hand of god blessing our lives and notice if crossing over into a promise or in this case the baptism of the holy ghost it's going to take patience and this is one i forgot to bring out a few weeks ago you remember that they had to wait ten days to cross over in the book of acts they had to wait three days in the book of joshua remember that god said you're going to cross over in three days prepare yourself so see in each case god had to give them a little patience you're not going to cross over instantly it's not going to be an instant miracle to cross over you're going to have to be patient and if you're patient and keep the word of god i will take you over undoubtedly i'll take you over for sure without any doubt i'll take you over but you've got to wait on my timing and you must obey my word and it's done by exalting the word remember the priest exalted the ark praise god you've got to exalt the word in your life the word has to be number one reading your bible praying fasting giving alms going to church has to be far above everything else in your life amen and then you got to give the word preeminence you got to that word was a thousand feet ahead of the uh or 200 paces i'm rather ahead of the israelites you've got to put the word way out there in front of you it's got to lead every decision you make praise god you have to make sure it's the first thing and then if you have patience and you do that and you exalt the word of god and you put the word you give the word preeminence god's going to fight for you praise god he will it's it's a it's a proven formula for success amen and then purposeful sinning will hinder the whole church right we learned that because the paul said many that take the communion uh they take it without discerning the lord's body and many are weak and sickly among you because they don't do that so isn't it awesome god heals our bodies we haven't had anybody die in the church lately that's a blessing praise god right it's a huge blessing because in the in the corinthian church they did have people die they did and it was because they weren't living the right kind of life amen you know over the last year or two i've heard of different people that have died young people around the message and when i heard about their testimony some of them were running from god and then and then i heard the families testify like a young man who was in the military passed away but i heard the family's prayer was lord if if he won't repent take him home if he won't change his life so that that was the that was the testimony of the family a young man running from the message disobeying the message so remember god is a merciful god church but also god is a all-knowing god as well and he will do he will do what's best just like in this corinthian church he took some of them home because they weren't discerning the lord's body the bible says god will not be mocked amen the bible said what a what a serious thing to fall in the hands of an angry god right it's a fearful thing the bible says in hebrews chapter 12 it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of an angry god because they've heard it their whole life and this this gentleman in particular was raised in the message he knew the message he met all the message preachers he knew everything about it but he continued to disobey and he had some children outside of a marriage and never got married and had kids outside of wedlock in other words fornication and different things that he chosen to do and just ran from god let's not run from god let's run to god amen and we'll kind of touch on this thought a little later in this message but that but one sin one disobedience can hinder the whole church but i'm glad god's healing our sick praise god i'm glad we're able to humble ourselves recognize the presence of the lord amen hallelujah and remember god fights some of your battles as you faithfully worship and obey like jericho i didn't put up there but but some of the battles god will have you partake in he wants you to experience the battle in other words praying a long time for somebody or facing somebody face to face and you feel like it's going to be a battle and your heart's about pumping through your shirt and you know it's going to be an awful situation but you got to stand there like christ stood there praise god you have to face your accusers and face the difficult situations standing there and you've got to fight praise god and god teaches you how to fight with the sword of the holy spirit praise god and we're taught to pray before every battle like a.i right we must pray before we go up to battle so important and then remember that permanent separation from old habits is essential for victory god wouldn't even let them go to jericho until they were first circumcised in other words you couldn't you you're not going to get certain victories until you're circumcised from the things of the world until you've got real victories in your life god won't even let you approach some of these these these mountains or we can say like there's great obstacles god won't let you approach the giants until you're circumcised from the old egyptian lifestyle there it is amen hallelujah praise god remember the reproach of egypt had to be cut away praise god and once it was cut away now they can fight giants amen in other words god god wants you to be a totally different person from egypt he wants to be you know what he doesn't want you have the slave mentality he wants to have the warrior mentality amen but it takes the circumcision it takes cutting and pain right they had to be healed right then to be cut and then healed and that's what it takes for some of us we got to go through difficult times and we got to lose maybe friendships we got to lose different uh family relationships we got to lose some of those and know the pain of it but let the holy ghost heal us so then god can use us and in a trial we won't run back to the world but we'll know we're a separated soldier to christ hallelujah praise god amen you won't run into mom or you won't we won't run back to the denomination when things get tough amen but you will stay faithful to god you'll stay true to god because you're totally consecrated to god amen amen and we learned and we'll look at this later we must make an effort to remember god's victories and his faithfulness because that's what they did in the in joshua and that's what peter told us with a statue of perfect man i'm going to constantly bring you into remembrance of the virtues of jesus christ the the character qualities i call in the book i call it character qualities of jesus christ because when you say virtues well there is a virtue called virtue and it kind of seems overlapping and confusing right so i just use character qualities those are the qualities of jesus christ's personal character and remember compromise is avoided through prayer and background checks in other words just don't take somebody's first word about a story especially if it's about a minister or it's about somebody outside the church don't take somebody's first story you go check with them yourself right because if not it becomes gossip right don't just believe everything you hear check it out do some research right and number nine uh conquer your responsibilities first before seeking other responsibilities and that's from the scripture a bishop must rule his home first before he rules the house of god so you know before just a little testimony before i was a uh ordained a pastor brother brooks you know he had me preach for him and after i always forget i'll never forget after my first sermon i mean the altar was filled and we prayed there maybe half hour hour i don't know how long we prayed there in lima but after the service you know he was all we're all crying in the office and he's like whatever you're doing brother jesse he said you keep doing it so what i was doing was fasting and praying before i preached so i've always done that right that that's my formula for success and he always told me he said i always loved how you run your home because brother brooks would come over before i was a pastor he'd stay the night at our house and he told you he'd have he had the midlife crisis thing so he would like literally drive three hours to come and stay at our house at like a drop of a hat and so lydia i don't know if literally remembers i don't know if malachi remembers but he would just come and hang out at our house just to get relief from his battles and he always said i wish i would have ran my house like you do and so that told me before i was a pastor that uh i was ruling my house well right and he always told me to he said never leave your children he said always stay with your children and always keep the bible studies going and so i've always done that i've tried to take his his wisdom and apply that to my life praise god and so when i saw the holy spirit was in my home and i knew it was but i just i needed confirmation then i knew god could call me to be a pastor as well praise god and so that's what i've learned here i possess my home and then i can lead the church by the grace of god amen and 10 god is very merciful merciful rather to those that fear him we saw that with rahab and we saw that with the gibeonites these these individuals just fear god and god gave them a token amen right and then god god spared them from genocide god was going to destroy the whole gibeonites thousands of people but because they fear god enough to come approach israel and ask for mercy then god spared them from genocide right because they were guilty for over 400 years of idolatry but they were willing in that moment to forsake it all just to survive and so god forgave them and then they became workers for the house of god amen hallelujah and remember believers have unique ministries from one another not every pastor is the same not every evangelist is the same not every preacher is the same not every sister is the same not every brother is the same now we all got to line up with the word but everybody has a slightly different unique type of ministry and never use i'm sorry always use your liberty as a blessing and not as a stumbling block right the main examples in the bible are eating meat and drinking wine be very careful with what you eat right and then uh association visiting other places that are that are not uh christian places in other words be careful the restaurants you go to right for example we don't go to applebee's very much because now we get takeout sometimes but because of that all the drink in there and the the tvs with the sports on it it's just too much worldly things it's just uh i wouldn't want to go to that kind of place all the time because if they see you there then you're kind of associated with that right and especially as a me i i used to like sport so that's a that's a heavy temptation for me i just want to watch the game instead of looking at my family you know that's why we don't go there but you don't want to make anybody stumble right by the the liberties that you experience right and then 13 was the last one remember where you came from like joshua reminded them remember we looked at sunday remember where you come from where the gospels come to you and also the last you know spiritual fathers and then choose to daily surrender to christ's will the real christian victory is what joshua said choose you this day whom you will serve you say brother jesse i chose to serve god 10 years ago i know but i'm asking you to follow him today too i'm asking you to choose to follow him and obey him right now praise god because today's the most powerful choice amen because remember you can undo your other choice in the past today you can undo it today but if i choose today to obey god then i'll be blessed tomorrow amen amen right judas chose for three and a half years right three and a half years to follow jesus but then that one day he chose to leave that passover scene and satan filled his heart and that's where he lost his salvation right so see the the most important choice is today it'll always be the most important choice praise god is daily surrendering to the will the perfect will of jesus christ now you see we saw three great themes in this book that first you conquer through strength you've got to be strong in the lord like austin was he's listening to four sermons from brother brown for the last two days i thought he's gonna be strong now right he's gonna be real strong like me if i get up at five i have two and a half hours to study before work i'm gonna be strong that day if i study for two and a half hours i'm gonna be i'm gonna be burning up you know with the fire of god and you that's how you'll conquer the enemy is through strength not weakness strength praise god and then uh you see the theme of dividing everyone in inheritance and then you see this theme of remembering the ways the victories of god so just briefly uh these won't last very long either conquering through strength is seen through joshua joshua says three times to be strong and very courageous so the constant theme is we can't be weak christians right you don't want a weak preacher right you don't want me to be weak when you come up for when you're sick do you want me to be weak and say like mr devil would would you leave today would that be okay mr devil would that be all right you know you don't want a weak preacher right well i don't know if i should preach this i don't want to offend anybody if it's god's word i don't care who it offends right you want a bold preacher in fact i want god's word to offend you praise god because it'll defend your flesh it'll offend your flesh right and that will get you out of the flesh and hopefully get you to repent and get you back in the holy spirit praise god or sinners jesus had to drive away 70 of his own preachers amen because the foreknowledge of god said they wouldn't accept it anyway they're just here for the miracles so people eat sometimes i don't mind if they leave let them leave because all the predestination will stay so we got to be it's got to be bold praise god we got to be strong in the lord praise god like i don't want a preacher to come in here and not bawl us out if we're sinning we need to be bawled out the bible said god rebukes all that he loves amen and if he doesn't rebuke you you're not a real son of god or daughter of god he's got to rebuke you but we must be strong and very courageous so let's have courage for this year's battles praise god or whatever battle you're in right now be courageous and say god is going to fight my battle for me amen god is with me praise god he's gonna he's with me in the fire and he'll bring me through the fire amen i don't care who the enemy is i don't care what the struggle is god is gonna bring me through i've got courage amen i'm gonna win this amen somehow or another even if it goes into next year i'm going to win this amen that's courage amen we all can have courage for like 24 hours right or at least do we wake up well if i feel good in the morning i know i have courage you know if i'm sick tonight or something like that but we gotta have courage like if i gotta fight till i'm 30 or if i get a fight till i'm 40 or if i got to fight till i'm 50 i'm gonna keep fighting because it's a worthy cause it's the best the lord's battle amen i'm fighting with the lord's purpose in mind praise god this is god's battle amen and i'm a warrior in this army praise god and this army cannot be defeated amen that's what we need today strong and courageous saints i believe we got him praise god i believe you got him amen like brother amen and who when i visit them at the hospital they're laying on their backs and who is all exhausted and brother amen he's got that pneumonia and cometh he said just give me a prayer cloth i said that's that's courage right there sister who said can you just bring a prayer cloth please that's right courage give me something to place my faith upon amen how did an area they could have said i'm done with you brother jesse if god don't answer our prayers god don't give a miracle they could have done that right anybody could have done that when we're sick and tired but i like how they were courageous give me something to i can place my faith on give me something to hang on to give me some confirmation that god's my healer amen amen and that's for all your sicknesses all of our sicknesses right make us strong and very courageous praise god now the division of the inheritance is a huge portion of scripture so see it's it's that simple picture i showed you maybe since austin i don't think austin has seen this one let me scroll down i'm on number 15. remember i showed it to you a few weeks ago the spiritual nation you have to conquer that may take me a while so bear with me i think it'll be worth the effort if i can find it remember i had brazil and then i kind of divide it up into spiritual uh locations boy it's been a while since i preached on that where'd you go fella but austin i took a a picture of brazil the an outline of the political map and then i just divided up into five imaginary uh there it is thank you lord 439 just just a few so austin it's like this once you get the baptism of the holy ghost you go into the promised land and you have to possess the relationships for your life right but like in joshua first you had to get circumcised cross over jordan possessing the land was years away now i'm not saying it will be years away for us all the time but i'm just saying some of the more mature victories you're going to get are years away i will say that not everyone but some of your major victories like brother rams complex when did he get the victory right at the end of his life right that was a major very mature victory it came at the very end of his life that stomach pain right at the very end of his life he got victory over that some of our victories are going to be our greatest victory is going to be later on after years and years of battles and rests and battles and rest we have to wait years to get the victories and that's how it was in joshua they had to battle many years and then god started giving them rest and then they could have their own place then they could have their possession and they could know that now i've got peace and and now god's placed me somewhere now i know where i stand with god amen so see you may get the holy ghost and it may be years before you understand all your ministries for like for me i i hope i have a missionary ministry one day i don't know if i will but i hope i do because i love to go to places they've never heard the message and preach the gospel to them right i don't know maybe that's a later one or maybe vocation what's my job what does god call me to do like paul became a tet maker right so he didn't have to take offerings from the churches see that was a victory he had to gain your nine gifts of the holy spirit maybe you've always felt like i was i was i was gonna have a a gift of miracles but it's gonna take years till you're ready for it if you had done miracles at the beginning you might have got a little prideful right or if i would have a prophecy at the beginning i might have got a little prideful so god saves it till later on in your life right so just consider those things once you get the holy ghost you're going to fight a lot a lot of battles but then later on you'll be placed you'll know well god's called me to be a deacon or god's call me to be a housewife with a gift to do this and a gift to do that or god's called me to be a grandpa with a gift of prayer cloth amen glory amen it's like divine healing brother in miracles it's kind of what it is in your life you know people just get those and they get miracles that's the holy spirit praise god because he's not a healer none of us are healers but you grow into these things as you get older you grow and you see where god's giving you a possession well this is where god lord just let me be faithful with this inheritance amen praise god amen let me be faithful with this and location you know well i wonder why i'm here am i going to be here forever lord let me say it like this lord if you want me to be an actor in a small church my whole life i'll say praise the lord amen because i just want to be where god wants me to be big churches big problems little churches little problems i'll take the little church right because think about think of all the major scandals some of these churches have gone through i can name the biggest churches in the u.s and canada and they have some of the biggest scandals there are like murders there's the biggest church in america had a murder a few years ago and both people went to the message but this one this woman was a daughter and she lost her mind she was in her she was a a middle-aged woman in her 50s well she had some mental problem and she shot and killed her dad in a message church i told you the message church in canada one of the biggest ones in the world had that adultery of the pastor's daughter a fornication with a with a with a minor see so some of the biggest churches you might think oh everything's great not all the time we're going to have our troubles but hopefully they're really small troubles by god's grace that's our desire and as long as you possess the land there will be no major scandals by god's grace so see once you get the holy ghost you're going to fight fight fight you're going to learn how to fight and then you're going to enter into your inheritance hallelujah praise god amen you've got to fight and learn how to fight be a warrior be faithful make no compromises amen learn how to obey the word of god learn how to pray before battles and after all these victories god will say now here here's your possession amen hallelujah praise god that's the order conquering through strength and then division of inheritance praise god everyone say jesus you're my inheritance amen he is and he'll give you gifts right he'll give you all these blessings so hopefully also not just a little visual for you and you'll go throughout your life and you'll uh learn how to uh possess all those now here's a beautiful one this this is i heard a preacher preach this i'm like i need to go study this and it was joshua's all about remembering right in joshua 4 they set up 12 stones for crossing jordan as a sign and remember they set them up in the water and then over by was it gilgal yeah gilgal memorials and this is going to play into the end of the sermon so this is important chapter six god puts a sign or joshua puts a sign on jericho whoever builds this city will be cursed their first two sons will be will die right and that happened i think 600 years later when the man tried to rebuild it his first two sons died it's a sign the valley of acor they put stones on aiken's body as a sign don't bring babylonian clothes into your house don't dress like a harlot right and brothers don't dress like a homosexual right a homosexual called me uh from another state and i'm in contact with them to try to walk them out of homosexuality right now i was texting him he and i were texting today he left a voicemail my voice a message a few days ago uh i've been talking to him and we're going to set up a time to talk to try to bring this brother out how many believe we got the holy spirit of deliverance amen brother i've done it before i've i've talked to people on the phone and while i'm talking to them that evil spirit leaves them that happened last year amen i didn't hear you i had a two-hour talk with a man i was mentoring and i remember i was walking around the church cleaning in here and he said while i was talking to him just last year the devil left him amen i didn't hear you praise god it's not always foaming lips and screaming and falling on the floor sometimes it's a little different praise god but each time the person's free praise god it's just like when music drives away evil thoughts amen and music will drive away depression amen i'm not going to be depressed i'm going to be encouraged amen that's my favorite song that's my jubilee song i'm going to worship god amen i'm going to overcome this fear amen i'm going to overcome my doubts and discouragement i'm a child of god this song brought me back into deliverance praise god amen amen joshua chapter 8 they put stones upon the king of ai as a sign in joshua 10 they put stones upon the caves after they killed those five kings and put them in the cave they put stones upon the caves as a sign and that's one thought i never brought out church that was such a beautiful thought because joshua was fighting for the gibeonites the greatest victor the greatest miracle joshua ever said son stands still happened when he was fighting for somebody lesser than him amen that's what abraham did praise god abraham was fighting in prayer for a lot amen he said lord respect a lot will you give me 50 how about 40 35 20 10 praise god and god sent angels down there to make sure abraham's prayer was answered amen amen is there any greater miracle than saving souls no sir the greatest miracle there is is a soul that's passed from death unto life amen your body will get sick again you'll get tired you may lose arms and you may get sick but once your soul is sealed it seems to the day of your redemption amen see church some of our greatest victories will be when we serve other people when we're fighting for other people when we're putting our time as a sacrifice for other people praise god that's what joshua found remember he was called into that the gibb and i said come on up here we got these five kings coming against us so they sacrificed they left everything remember they went all they walked all night they walked all through the night to ambush those guys and some of your greatest victories some of my greatest victories will be in serving other people that's why i've seen the greatest miracles when i made the greatest sacrifice down there in guyana and trinidad i saw that mo the most instant instant miracles was there praise god so remember let's always be open to serving other people let's not live for ourselves let's live for others i forgot about that thought i never brought that thought out but i just struck me last week and i forgot to preach it chapter 22 remember uh the east side believers i'll say like east side they set up a large altar as a witness a sign and joshua 24 remember joshua puts a stone under the oak as a witness between joshua and israel so does anybody think memorials are important that's why i love that statue perfect man that's why i love that picture right there that's why i love all those pictures in there i like remembering what god has done praise god and if there's miracles in here that god has done remind me i'll take a picture of that and we'll put it up we'll hang it up somewhere they're probably gonna be in my office you know but uh so i ordered this a few days ago this is gonna arrive in two weeks this is my first memorial that's the screenshot of when april 19 2020 i preached the first ser the first sermon on the philippians series and i've been studying on philippians and they started you know one of the main things they did at the beginning was they got the prayer class right and so as i'm preaching i'm like brother jose do you got that prayer call from brother branham right a week so we prayed uh vang took it a week later he was out he was out he was it was he was out at home i'm sorry week later he was oh he was awake in the hospital two weeks later he was at home already so that's that's a miracle memorial there and that was such a special moment always remember that moment praise god and church i hope the holy spirit helps us never forget that moment amen see because we have so much power in remembering and look at that picture brother bang's got his hand up there he's like i believe i'm i'm gonna go take this to my my dad i'm gonna call this lying vanities this pole in the plug talk that's lying vanities he's gonna live again and look at him today hallelujah god give him another chance god give him another chance god is gracious church god is gracious so let's say i want to start i want to be like joshua i see i thought this summer i could draw a picture of it you know but i was like i don't have time for that so forgive me so i'm just going to order a picture so hopefully i get here in a couple weeks or so trying to find a place to hang that up as a memorial now let me try to finish with this i got about 26 minutes on my hour so uh let's learn here what the book of joshua i'm sorry book of judges rather sorry what does judges reveal about the book of joshua and i think you'll be blessed by some of these thoughts maybe i'll preach some of them before but i think they'll be fresh here for you tonight so if you got your bible let's go to judges chapter one please remember our text our text said that all the generation that knew joshua and saw the works of god and outlive joshua they were faithful to the commands of god so any man that saw what joshua did they heard about the miracles they saw that all the children anyone that saw that they lived faithful to god the rest of their lives see god visited that generation and that generation never forgot god's miracles praise god that's why we'll never forget god's miracles praise god and that's that's a great lesson we learned through this so i want to go through this kind of uh within the next 25 minutes or so now judges chapter 1 verses 1 to 4 shows israel starting well by inquiring of the lord for battle and they win the first battle so let's look at judges 1 verse 1. now after the death of joshua came to pass that the children of israel asked the lord saying who shall go up for us against the canaanites first to fight against them and the lord said judah shall go up because judah was praised and judah became the tribe that held the scepter right he was going to eventually dave was going to come out of him pretty soon right so dave was going to come out in about 400 years verse 3 and judah said unto simeon his brother come up with me into my lot that we may fight against the canaanites and i likewise will go with thee into thy lot so simeon went with him and judah went up and the lord delivered the canaanites and the and the pair parasites rather into their hand and they slew of them in beasic ten thousand men so it's a pretty good start right joshua's off the scene that's a really good start you go and pray before a battle god gives you 10 000 enemies defeated praise god now verses five through 20 are kind of a review of when caleb challenged his tribe who will go up and defeat uh the mountain remember and off neil goes up so it's it's a little bit of repeat from joshua so go to verse 21. now in verse 21 we start seeing compromise instead of full victories we start seeing incomplete victories okay so verses 21 through 26 show the beginning of benjamin's incomplete victory in other words they didn't drive out all their enemies right they still left some of them there now think about this church just for a moment should a holy ghost-filled person let some of their cuss words remain in their vocabulary or should they get a complete what do you think should a holy ghost christian come continue committing fornication or should he or she get total victory over all fornication total victory total victory i'm talking major sins right because brother brahm one time lied to the irs well we'll have those are minor sins right also now we're talking about that we'll still commit minor sins but all the major sins all the major enemies we should drive out and they should be totally driven out by the grace of god like we'd say like homosexuality right that's one of the listed of these anyone who does these sins will not inherit the kingdom of god heresies right now that's the one that that's that's a sin that gets a lot of people today they teach heresies outside the real word of god they're not committing any you know sexual sin or they're not committing any murders but a heresy is on the same level because it's an antichrist spirit it's that white horse rider there he is amen it's that white horse rider and if not checked it'll become a red horse rider and start murdering people's influence and then it'll set up its own kingdom it'll lead to spiritual death and then you will see a lot of sexual sin or you will see a lot of other sins awesome heresy is a person teaching their own belief or their own doctrine the bible also calls it doctrines of devils okay so in the bible a few of the examples are a few of the examples are you cannot eat meat that was called a doctrine of a devil like catholics do that uh only well yeah it could be like that only if they say like god doesn't want you to eat meat i mean you can be healthy not eat meat right because some of that meat's not so healthy these days another one was you're not allowed to marry and that's also in the catholic church they don't let priests marry so two doctrines of devils specifically called doctrines of devils are right there prominent in the catholic church now there's other ones i believe like when you say every word brother branham said does that say the lord i believe that's an absolute heresy i believe that's no i don't believe anybody can preach that and say they're born again impossible because that's a lie that's making brother branham equal to jesus christ and no man god said i will not share my glory with any man because god saved brother branham god died for brother branham god rose to forgive brother branham we we honor god's prophets but we don't worship them and we never exalt them to equal to christ because no brother bram said i'm just one pebble on the beach that means we're all pebbles and there's a great god who's way up there and he's far above all those pebbles amen now of course i believe he's a little bit a lot bigger pebble than me and you right we agree we agree on that right i'm a sand he's a pebble i'm a grain of sand he's a he's a large pebble but nobody touches jesus amen he's the rock of ages amen hallelujah so heresies are also these sins that should never come into holy ghost-filled churches adultery is another one right a man should never sleep with another man's wife right or vice versa those are just obvious ones child child abuse that's an absolute uh sin wicked sin from from hell and that person there's no way that person is born again to abuse a child who can't defend themselves absolute sin wicked and wickedness doc it's a devil it's a devil that's what the catholic church has a lot of that too and not just the priests but the nuns as well it's been exposed in the last few years it's nuns as well doing to the little girls yep they're just it's just uh it's in their dna it's in their uh jezebel dna it is uh great question but now here these are so should there be a little bit of abuse in the church absolutely not all those enemies should be driven out and this should be a place of healing this should be a place of of sincerity there should be a place of total freedom amen where you can just be yourself be who made god be who god made you to be be a joyful happy christian praise god serve one another you'll know they're my disciples because they love everybody that's how you'll know you're a real christian oh hallelujah praise god amen but benjamin look at verse 21 and the children of benjamin did not look at that not drive out the jebusites that inhabited jerusalem but the jebusites dwell with the children of benjamin and jerusalem unto this day okay go down to verse 27. now 27 through 36 the rest of the chapter shows all these tribes check this out manasseh e from zebulun asher naphtali five five more tribes with benjamin there's six half of the tribes get incomplete victories and one of them gets completely embarrassed that's dan so seven so right after joshua and all that generation that knew about the holy ghost knew about son stand still they saw these miracles after all that generation died the next generation is way weaker and they start compromising and say well we can have a little bit of cussing we can have a little bit of heresies we can have a little bit of child abuse we can have a little bit of adultery but any holy ghost field christian knows none of those things should not be named one time in the church of the living god amen he that names the name of christ let him depart from all those iniquities amen in verse 27 manasseh did not drive out the canaanites but then verse 28 they put them under tribute well you guys can live but you got to pay us taxes now look that's a businessman that's a businessman that will do evil sins in order to make some money right that's a businessman let's say that won't pay his tithes and offerings he's gonna let that sin stay in there so i can make a little extra dollar no no don't don't don't put up god said drive them all out god said god never said compromise with sin and let let the devil live in your church he never said that he said don't compromise and drive it all out verse 29 ephraim let the canaanites live there zebulun in verse 30 let the canaanites and made them pay tributaries so they're going to make a little money from their sin see that don't do any shady deals church don't do any bad deals make sure you get every dollar the right way because these tribes got money the wrong way by disobeying the word of god do not skip church to work god will not bless you right we've seen it numerous times the different friends i've known through the years don't do it if you have it now some of you don't have a choice that's different if you have a choice your all that is is another manassa move right all it is is another zebulon tributary trying to make money thinking you can make money by breaking god's command it's impossible praise god no job for man is more important than the job god wants you to do praise god and that stay under the anointing so you stay under the anointing your wife and your chin understand and anointing your family stays under anointing god wants you under the anointing with all enemies under your feet don't worry about money you follow god and god will have the money chase you praise god amen god's god's blessings are running after you amen they're chasing after you praise god just put god first asher let the inhabits inhabitants of zydon and numerous other afic rehab all these other canaanites or whatever he let them live verse uh 33 naphtali let more canaanites dwell there and look at verse 34 this is that we'd say this is an embarrassing one and the amorites force the children of dan into the mountain now church any man knows you can't you can't plant good crops on the mountain that's not fertile soil if you're gonna have some good you know vineyards and you're gonna have some cattle cattle don't like being on the mountain you always see cattle on the flatlands right but dan was pushed out of their their fertile farming lands to go live in the mountains for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley where you have the waters and you have the the green pastures but the amorites verse 2 35 would dwell in the mount heras in aegian and in shelby yet the hand of the house of joseph prevailed so that they became tributaries and the coast of the amorites was from going up to akrabim for the rock and upward imagine that the devil overcame dan we'd say and made him isolated from all the other tribes he lost his inheritance and was isolated all himself up on a mountain because he couldn't drive out the enemy at church that's what happens with people satan will drive them off of their victories and then they'll be isolated away from church right i said well you come to church but you don't fellowship afterwards and you have no contact with oth with the rest of the body because satan has defeated them and satan look satan's pushing you around instead of you pushing satan around come on church we're supposed to push the devils around we're supposed to cast them out praise god we're supposed to live where god wants us to live we're supposed to live in victory not run from our possession we're supposed to possess the land amen amen so we see seven seven tribes compromising and one of them was so weak now what happened to dan later he set up the idol remember and that way his name was removed under the book of life under heaven under heaven so look at these lessons and what when does this happen when a generation rises that didn't know joshua joshua means jesus a generation that didn't know joshua this is the kind of testimonies people have when they didn't know joshua see where i'm going chapter two we'll end in chapter two because i got about 12 more minutes for my hour see i love this this was a good thought i was like oh my this is a good thought and sunday lord willing i'm going to preach this thought the disciple whom jesus loved because i want you to know jesus loves you john always called himself the disciple whom jesus loved i heard that and i was like oh yeah i wrote that down months ago i was going to preach that but and then just came to me this week i'm just sitting there i'm like oh i guess i felt like i got struck i got to preach that so i'm going to study that out and preach that out on sunday lord willing disciple whom jesus loved in chapter two verses one through nine now look at this an angel now here this is quite a this is quite a story before joshua died we're not told this in the book of joshua we're told this in the book of judges before joshua died an angel visits the generation and says some of you are going to transgress the word look at verse 1 chapter 2 verse 1. and the angel lord came up from gilgal to botch him and said i made you to go up out of egypt and i brought you unto the land which i swear unto your fathers and i said i will never break my covenant with you look at that how many know god will never break his covenant with you you've got a greater covenant than they got praise god you've got the blood of jesus christ verse 2 and you shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land you shall throw down their altars but you have not obeyed my voice why have you done this wherefore i said also i will not drive them out from before you but they shall be as thorns in your sides and your god shall be a snare unto you and it should come to pass when the angel lord spake these words unto all the children of israel that the people lift up their voice and wept is that a good sign that's a really good sign verse five and they called the name of that place bachim and they sacrificed there unto the lord that means weepers they called this place weepers and when joshua had let the people go the children of israel went every man unto his heritage to the to possess the land now look at verse seven so see this was a good thing this was god visiting one more time before joshua died verse seven and the people served the lord all the days of joshua doesn't that sound familiar that's what we read in joshua 24 31 and all the days of the elders that outlived joshua who had seen all the great works lord that he did for israel and joshua the son of none the servant lord died being a hundred and ten years old and they buried him in the border of inheritance and tim netheres in the mount of ephraim on the north side of the hill gaash isn't this just this is such a beautiful story god visits them and says some of you are going to transgress and so the people they're so heartbroken oh my that should make us heartbroken right if the holy spirit would visit us and say there's going to come a time in a generation when the akron church isn't going to serve god it would make us weep and cry because we think all this labor all that we've done although we try to draw closer to god and sacrifice and worship how can this happen well that's what happened in joshua's day they said how is this going to happen so they worship god they sacrifice to god and god receive their sacrifice but the next generation wasn't impacted like the first generation see that that breaks a believer's heart when they know other people are not going to serve god like they did and so it break their heart so much it was called the place of weepers these people were weeping and saying oh god help us let the next generation keep your covenant let this next generation serve you like we're serving you may we not let down the bars may we not compromise help us be a people that really manifest your character praise god verses 10 to 15. look at verse 10 this is one of the saddest scriptures in the bible it reminds me of the lukewarm scripture and spewing you out of my mouth and i never knew you depart from me that were conquered this is one of the saddest scriptures and also all that the generation were gathered in their fathers and there arose another generation after them which knew not the lord nor yet the works which he had done for israel now church i put up here the next generation after joshua's and those that outlived him they chose to reject the ways of joshua now look at this there's a difference between knowing about god and knowing god that's what this problem was these this next young generation they saw the weeping they saw they saw joshua the young generation they knew about god now look they could see all those ten they could see all those ten reminders those those altars those signs they could see them all day all day long they knew about god but they didn't know god and that's exactly what jesus said you've done wonderful works in my name but i never knew you because you work iniquity what does that show you your works show how much you know god amen your works declare whether you know god or you don't know god in other words your daily life shows if you know god or not amen if you're constantly working righteousness or you're constantly working iniquity that proves if you know god or not just a miracle of itself doesn't prove that you know god and then james 2 verse 19 says you say you believe but the demons believe and they tremble at god at least they tremble see that generation before joshua died they wept and trembled oh god don't let this generation not know you but they wept because they knew god and they didn't want to see how could after all we've seen after all we've done after all the battles we fought how could the next generation forget yet they did and we find out in the next few verses why they forgot a generation rises that doesn't know the lord like the previous generation knew the lord look at verse 11 and the children of israel did evil the sigh lord and served balaam you know baal worship well it had a lot of sexual sins in it right uh the bail the bale gods were fertility gods right so they would go and they would have like prostitutes and all kinds of things and they would sacrifice the babies if somebody got pregnant a lot of child sacrifice so see what entered in what distracted this young generation from the ways of joshua sexual pleasures that's what see if the young generation doesn't know god that's what's going to get them too right sexual sin because it's pleasurable and and the young generation hasn't made god their pleasure they've not sought after god they've never called on god they never found their real joy in holiness praise god they're pleasure seekers of the world instead of seeking pleasure from the holy spirit so the next generation says well we're going to have sexual pleasure instead of obeying the ways of god oh it gets ever it gets every church if the church isn't born again or the next generation is born again sexual sin will get them every time now skip down uh verse 12 says they get other gods they bow down verse 13 they forsook the lord and serve baal sexual sin and asteroth she's the queen of heaven now what does that remind you of mary they call mary the queen of heaven what's that remind us of catholicism so they went to worshipping women worship or ancestor worship right spiritualism and sexual pleasures in other words they they believed everything that was fantasy instead of the reality that their parents had tried to teach them and that's the responsibility of all my children and all the children in this church you have to know god and the way you'll know god is when the enemy comes you either cast down the enemy or you give in to the enemy you either live for pleasure or you live for christ amen that's how you know praise god and don't tell me that that previous generation didn't teach them the word of god joshua said my house will serve the lord amen in other words he taught his children the word he told him everything he knew but pretty soon a generation rose up not maybe not joshua's children but somebody in their tribe and they wanted pleasure more than they wanted to remember the ways of god so see it comes that each person has the individual choice god's not going to force you to serve him god wants you to choose to serve him amen i don't know god wants you and your free more agency to say i'm casting down these pleasures i'm casting down these lusts of the flesh these pride of life and lust of the eyes i'm casting this out and i'm choosing because i love god i'm choosing god's ways verse 14 and the anger lord was hot against israel he delivered them in the hands of the spoilers that spoiled them and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about so they could not any longer stand before their enemies it got so bad they couldn't resist the sexual sin they were just slaves to it they couldn't resist the child abuse they couldn't resist the the heresies the doctrines of devils it got so bad that now god's angry at them because they don't even fight against the sin ah god help us amen see that's why your addictions have to be overcome amen you have to overcome your addictions or you got to keep up the fight amen keep up the fight don't give in don't become addicted keep up the fight like brother like i was talking about austin you know we're going to battle things it's going to go it's going to be gone for a while and it's going to come back you got to be ready before it comes back so you don't become a slave to it especially if you battled that thing before you got to be ready to drive it off you got to be ready to fight you can't stop fighting you got to be a warrior you gotta have the fighter's mentality amen praise god now look at verse fifteen wherever wherever they went out the hand lord was against them for evil so instead of god sending hornets before them and helping them like we saw on sunday instead of god tearing down walls of jericho god was fighting against them and causing everything to fall apart see we want to see god going before us fighting our battles making a way opening doors closing doors right guiding us into his perfect will we don't want to see god fighting against us and the bible said they were greatly distressed so see fear right when people are fear fearful depressed and living wicked like that or living with this sin it shows they've lost the battle they're not winning the battle if you're living in distress all the time and no victory oh we should have some we should have the shout of the king in the camp amen i didn't know yeah if you're living above sin brother said don't uh uh don't jump no higher than you're living but church i've said this before if you're living over if you're living over lust you should be able to jump at least this high right now if you're living over if you're living above fear you ought to be able to jump at least that high and pretty soon i'm going to hit my head on here brother man said don't jump no higher than what you're living so if you're living let's jump like that praise god let's jump for jesus amen if you're living above those things let's rejoice in it let's remember i've got the victory praise god i'm more than a conqueror in christ jesus that's why sometimes i jump and shout and dance because i am living above these things i remember what it was like being a slave to the canaanites but i'm no longer under them i'm a free man i've got my possession i'm resting in the holy ghost amen hallelujah and i'm fighting when they come back austin i'm fighting and driving them back out praise god i don't let them stay on my land praise god they're not allowed in this church praise god those critical spirits and everything we battle spirits of depression or whatever more false doctrine that'll try to get here we don't let them stay we drive them out in jesus christ's name because we're fighters amen hallelujah we should be winning victories all the time and because of that we should be more than conquerors in christ jesus how many believe that now in verses 16 through 19 we see the pattern that israel fell into without joshua despite all their serving sexual pleasures and idolatry and queen of heaven and all this catholicism god raised up judges who would deliver them out of the hand of those that spoiled them and yet they would not hearken unto their judges they went a whoring so there's a sexual sin like spiritual sin right spiritual uh spiritual transgression is just like sexual sin right it's like a spiritual betrayal right they went whoring after other gods and bow themselves unto them they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in obeying the commandments of the lord but they did not sow and when the lord raised up them judges then the lord was with the judge and delivered them out of the hand of the enemies all the days of the judge for repenting the lord because of their groanings by reason of them that oppress them and vex them and it came to pass when the judge was dead that they returned and corrected themselves corrupted themselves more than their fathers in following other gods to serve them and to bow down unto them they cease not from their own doings nor from their stubborn way so it's this awful cycle and i actually got a picture let me go to the picture here real quick so it's that one right here so here's the cycle cycle is first well i guess the first sin would be their sin they bow down they get oppressed by nations they repent god would send deliverance but during the times of peace they would get lazy on god and then go back into sin and get under oppression and each trial got longer and longer and longer each time after deliver they were longer in sin longer in depression longer and bondage to slavery each time so god had to raise up a conqueror each time a judge praise god and this is the pattern without joshua is what i'm going back to this is the pattern if you don't have joshua in your camp if you have people that know joshua you're going to have some victories but then you're going to be worse off for a while you're going to need a deliverance and for years and years you'll be slave to sin and then you'll get a victory but then you'll fall back in this pattern you won't have consistent victory you won't have the enemies driven out but if you got joshua praise god you'll drive out king after king after king after king and you will clear the land praise god you'll possess all the promises you'll drive on all the inhabitants and you'll enjoy the good land that god wanted for you praise god but judges shows what happens when a generation rises and they don't know joshua their sin gets worse each and every time well they repent for a while they're good for a while they go back to the drugs or they go back to the sexual sin or they go back to the denomination it gets worse and worse and longer and longer and longer it's the cycle of death and revival brother man talks about the church age book but church our cycles are very short it's not like this we have a cycle we backslide but then we repent and get back to god it's not like we were backside for three weeks or four weeks no no our backsiding should last a couple days or maybe less than that praise god we should have such a conviction of the holy spirit that we couldn't imagine being backslidden for a long time could a man i can't imagine being backslidden for a year can you imagine that living and smoking and cussing or or drinking or fornicating or adultery for a whole year no way not in the house of the living god amen when we backslide it's just a short time and god gets us right back in the path of repentance right back in the path of obedience praise god because we know joshua hallelujah praise god i met jesus amen i know jesus amen he's fought my battles praise god i can never forget him amen he brought me the land amen amen i was there when he circumcised me i was there when he knocked down the walls of my enemies praise god i was there when he drove out my my addictions and my bad habits i was there i know what i saw praise god amen in verses 20 to 23 end of the chapter god's anger is against the new generation for their idolatrous transgressions in other words they would live and worshipping those gods for years and years and years till they finally got tired of it they'd cry out to god see that's why we need to pray every day pray tonight before you go to bed say lord jesus forgive me anything can forgive me and start fresh tomorrow morning don't let that any backstage or any sin go you mean we should we should all leave here forgiven right don't get in the habit of a cycle of sin break the cycle and start a cycle of victory praise god the lord left some of the enemies to prove him or to prove them whether or not the next generation would serve him or not so what is judges i'm closing here judges is a picture of trying to live a holy ghost-filled life but lacking the baptism holy ghost this is what we got in a lot of messed churches today they've received the word about the land in other words they know about the land they're raising the message but they don't have the same experience that the previous generation had and so idolatry comes into the land sexual sin comes in the land heresies come in the land money hungry people come in the land covetousness greed right fear adultery all these things they all come in the land they were born in it but they got to have a birth themselves amen after they need they need to birth themselves praise god amen judges shows what happens when a generation rises up that doesn't know joshua jesus christ it shows humans are their own worst enemies now look at this church israel now they're back in bondage under the judges despite being out of egypt in egypt they were slaves but now they're in the land and they're slaves again see so it doesn't matter where you live amen it matters that you get a new heart praise god amen you've got the holy ghost you can live clean in the midst of laodicea amen hallelujah praise god i'm in satan's eating but yet i'm a blood wash i'm a blood boy i'm a holy ghost failed saint that loves to praise god amen i trust in god for everything amen hallelujah see that's why uh holy ghost-filled saint he can be in a church where maybe some of them aren't born again and he can change the atmosphere and pray for them and bring the people under his anointing or her anointing they can still survive when you're a holy ghost-filled saint you can survive anywhere because you know joshua you won't forget joshua praise god you'll remember all joshua's great deeds because something when you saw joshua something happened something anchored into your soul something was sealed into your conscience amen when you saw joshua when you knew him when you know when you saw what he did you can never escape it it was written on the fleshly tables in your heart amen hallelujah see we've got to take the sin out of our own minds now that we're in the land paul so brother austin paul was one of the greatest christians there ever was he said he labored more than all the apostles paul he didn't even know jesus in the flesh he only knew jesus by the holy ghost but yet he said he saw a law and his members that would bring him into bondage to the law of sin and his members so paul would sometimes become enslaved to sin he said o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death so there'll be times in austin where we will fall short we'll fall short of the glory of god and we'll feel like we became enslaved and we'll feel wretched but we always must remember that jesus christ will deliver us from this flesh praise god he will now the book ends in judges 21 25 with these words in those days there was no king in israel every man did that which was right in his own eyes so i love how the book ends the book ends and this is church this book of judges is has some of the most violent and disturbing stories in the entire bible remember that last one where the concubine is raped and abused and cut up and sent all over the land that's the last chapter of judges some of the most wicked things in the bible are in here because they don't know joshua they forgot about joshua they knew about him up here but they didn't know him here praise god they have the same faith that joshua they weren't strong and courageous they just had head nows i don't want head knowledge of the message i want it in my head but i really want to end my soul praise god that's what i want the knowledge of god amen here so my very nature is to do the word my very nature is to obey the word amen and know that god is watching and he'll fight for me praise god and i don't have to serve other gods but i'll serve only one god the god of israel see judges these stories prove of the depths pew warmers or churchgoers will go who have no personal experience with christ raising the message raising the promised land but they don't have an experience with jesus christ that shows or because of that no experience they'll go to the world for pleasure and have awful things happen in their life because they don't know joshua are you glad you know joshua let's stand to our feet
