[0:00] I was studying this morning before work
[0:02] and I thought uh well let me look over
[0:04] my notes and his notes and I thought
[0:07] well maybe I I recently made a video on
[0:08] Job I think last Saturday. So I thought
[0:11] well I'll just preach on Job and I'll
[0:13] kind of tie in this thought that brother
[0:14] Brian preached to us and I'll just
[0:16] continue on Job. Praise God. There's a
[0:18] couple comments I got on YouTube saying
[0:20] uh you don't know how much I needed
[0:21] this. I needed to hear about Job and how
[0:23] it related to my situation. Um, and if
[0:26] you were blessed Sunday by Brian's
[0:28] message and David's message, then I
[0:29] thought, well, I'll just continue on
[0:30] that thought. I'll just trust the Holy
[0:32] Spirit. Uh, you know, Brian doesn't
[0:34] listen to my sermons. He doesn't watch
[0:35] my videos. So, he didn't know I put a
[0:37] Job video out and the next day he
[0:38] preaches on Job. So, uh, two witnesses.
[0:40] I just like to see that you like to see
[0:42] that. We like to see God giving us the
[0:44] same thoughts. Job 20, I'm sorry, Job 42
[0:47] verse5. Pardon me.
[0:51] So, I'd like to preach on this thought.
[0:52] Job heard, but then he saw the Lord. Job
[0:56] heard, but then he saw the Lord.
[1:00] Job 42:5. Let's read that if we can on
[1:02] three. One, two, three. I have heard of
[1:06] thee by the hearing of the ear, but now
[1:09] mine seeth thee. Amen. May God bless the
[1:13] reading of his word. You may be seated
[1:14] by God's grace.
[1:23] So that was the message title brother
[1:25] Brian preached on Sunday was in
[1:27] inspiration I have heard but now I see.
[1:30] So I'm taking out the inspiration I'm
[1:32] just putting it in there. Job heard but
[1:34] then he saw the Lord. Hallelujah. So uh
[1:38] all of us you know uh are familiar with
[1:39] the story of Job. But at the end I want
[1:42] to kind of bring out just a fresh
[1:43] thought that was fresh to me uh by the
[1:45] grace of the Lord. Um, we don't know
[1:49] many Jobes. I don't know if I know
[1:51] hardly any Jobes. Um, what we find is
[1:54] people that have a partial relation to
[1:57] Job. They can know like they can know
[1:59] one fraction of what Job went through.
[2:03] But there's at least uh
[2:06] five uh parts of Job's suffering that I
[2:10] don't know anyone who suffered that
[2:12] other than the Lord Jesus. Right?
[2:14] Because no man ever suffered like Jesus,
[2:16] right? Uh but he was holy. He was God in
[2:18] the flesh. He had the word nature, not a
[2:20] sin nature. Uh so that that's different
[2:23] because he was totally holy. Uh but we
[2:26] are not. We're born in sin, shape
[2:27] iniquity, come to the world speaking
[2:29] lies. But there's a five there's five
[2:31] layers to this suffering. And uh
[2:33] although many might claim to be like
[2:35] Job, very few actually are. And they
[2:37] don't really understand all that Job
[2:39] went through. Now, I'm not saying that
[2:41] to be critical, but I'm saying that uh
[2:43] let's not uh try to put pity on
[2:45] ourselves.
[2:46] &gt;&gt; Let's not try to let's not let the devil
[2:48] allow us to think we're suffering more
[2:50] than what we are
[2:52] &gt;&gt; in a rich free nation like we live in.
[2:56] &gt;&gt; Okay? In other words, this this ought to
[2:57] make us reflect and like, wow, I don't
[3:00] have it that bad.
[3:01] &gt;&gt; Like Austin shared some videos with me a
[3:03] few weeks ago of bombing in Gaza, right?
[3:05] And that shook up Austin. And he's like,
[3:06] "Wow, my problems pale in comparison to
[3:09] what they're going through with homes
[3:12] destroyed, whole entire communities in
[3:14] rubble, not knowing where your lunch is
[3:17] going to come from. No more electricity.
[3:19] Imagine how sad we get when the
[3:20] electricity is out for one or two or
[3:22] three hours."
[3:25] &gt;&gt; So hopefully this message brings us
[3:27] another perspective on it. But he's got
[3:29] at least five layers. The first one is
[3:32] that he suffered not for a day, not for
[3:34] a week, but months.
[3:37] So it's Job 29:2. I'll need a case to
[3:40] kind of be real fast here, fast typing
[3:42] here tonight by God's grace. Then I can
[3:45] read it and you got it. Oh, that I were
[3:47] as in months past. So it was more than
[3:50] at least two months. So he'd say at
[3:52] least 60 days at least, maybe more. It
[3:56] wasn't a year. He didn't say years, but
[3:58] months. months had passed where he had
[4:01] had soores all over him. Now, that's a
[4:03] that's another layer. But the first
[4:05] layer is suffering for months at a time
[4:07] with no breaks. Hallelujah. That's why I
[4:11] I've told this before publicly. I'm
[4:12] going to say it again. Brother Mike
[4:14] McCloskkey in that condition in his
[4:16] wheelchair because he was shot where he
[4:18] was shot in the back. He's have ner he
[4:20] has nerve pain 247.
[4:23] It never lets go. So imagine you got a
[4:26] cut, right? and your it was deep and
[4:28] your nerves are just it's
[4:31] it's throbbing. That's the word. Thank
[4:32] you, brother. That's 247 for him. You'll
[4:36] see if you're watching the live stream,
[4:38] every now and then he'll go like this.
[4:39] He'll go like like that because just the
[4:42] pain. Uh he just has to adjust himself.
[4:45] But what I've told him and I even told
[4:47] him again last night, I said, "Brother
[4:48] Mike, I don't know anyone who has more
[4:50] faith than you."
[4:54] Now, that's just my opinion. And here's
[4:56] why. Because he forgave the man who shot
[4:58] him in public. It's it was on TV. I can
[5:00] share the video with you. They wept and
[5:02] cried together. And then he held the
[5:04] Bible and he says, "I I don't want any
[5:06] charges against him because I've learned
[5:08] what forgiveness is by the King James
[5:10] Bible."
[5:12] &gt;&gt; And then despite after that, he still
[5:15] suffers every single day and refuses to
[5:18] quit, refuses to give up, refuse to get
[5:20] angry at God, and all he wants to do is
[5:22] love on people.
[5:24] And when when we get a little hurt or we
[5:26] get go through bad times, we get all
[5:27] discouraged and run out just, you know,
[5:30] just discouraged, frustrated, and yet we
[5:32] don't have all this constant pain that
[5:33] he has. So to me, that means that man
[5:35] has way more faith than me. Hallelujah.
[5:39] Because he's suffering day and night,
[5:40] year after year, 24/7 with no relief.
[5:45] &gt;&gt; And yet he's still and and brother
[5:47] brother Rod, he's gone into like Home
[5:49] Depot and Lowe's, prayed for sick
[5:51] people, and they're instantly healed.
[5:54] And yet God chooses not to heal him yet.
[5:57] Now that confused him for a while. You
[5:58] know, he thought about that for a while,
[5:59] but he's just learned to accept God will
[6:02] do what he wants to do in his time.
[6:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[6:08] So that's the first layer. Not weeks of
[6:10] pain, months of and the worst pain
[6:13] because of the boils, right? In other
[6:15] words, every time you try to lay down or
[6:17] move around, there's pain because you
[6:19] have open source all over your body.
[6:22] open source. Okay,
[6:26] so that's the first layer is months. The
[6:28] second layer he lost all of his
[6:30] children. That's in chapter one. Imagine
[6:33] having seven children, you know, seven
[6:35] boys, seven grown children and they one
[6:38] day they're here, the next day they're
[6:40] gone.
[6:42] Lost all of his children. No more babies
[6:44] to hug. Now, we know there probably
[6:46] weren't babies, but that's what the the
[6:48] point I'm making. No more children to
[6:49] hug on.
[6:52] having seven funerals.
[6:55] Anybody ever had seven funerals at the
[6:57] same time? See, so this is this is
[6:59] beyond anything you and I could
[7:01] understand. And church, this is all
[7:03] before he saw God. So that that's that
[7:06] magnifies Job's experience even more
[7:09] &gt;&gt; as far as I'm talking about his trust in
[7:12] God. We now you and I say we trust in
[7:14] God. We trust in God. How much do we
[7:16] trust in God?
[7:17] &gt;&gt; It's not to be discouraging, but to to
[7:19] try to encourage us. Let's trust God
[7:21] more. Hallelujah.
[7:24] &gt;&gt; If he could trust God in his experience,
[7:26] then we can trust God in our experience.
[7:29] &gt;&gt; And and remember again as we sang
[7:30] earlier, we could we have a Bible to
[7:33] trust in, right?
[7:35] &gt;&gt; Job didn't have a Bible.
[7:37] &gt;&gt; He just had the constellations, right?
[7:39] He talked about Orion and uh Pleaides. I
[7:42] can never say that. Do you know how to
[7:43] say it, Rod?
[7:44] &gt;&gt; Pleaides. Thank you.
[7:47] &gt;&gt; I'm a teacher and I need to be taught.
[7:49] Hallelujah.
[7:50] That's the truth. Third, he lost all of
[7:53] his wealth, all of his animals.
[7:56] So, think about your bank. Think think
[7:58] about that number in your bank account.
[7:59] Take that down to zero. You lost your
[8:01] cards. You lost your the bank's
[8:02] destroyed. You have you you have no way
[8:04] to get anything back. There's no FDIC
[8:07] that will pay your money back. It's all
[8:09] gone.
[8:11] Okay. And then his health,
[8:14] his health was that fourth layer. As I
[8:17] said, boils everywhere.
[8:20] Okay? I've never had boils like that. I
[8:21] don't know anyone who has had boils like
[8:23] that where they're just surrounding you
[8:26] all all over your body. Now, the boils
[8:28] leads to the fifth and final layer that
[8:32] he rarely got sleep.
[8:35] So upon all that, you know, we would
[8:37] think, well, at least at least you and I
[8:38] get to sleep during the night. He hardly
[8:41] got any sleep. So, get ready to pull
[8:43] that up there. Uh Job 73 and 4. Job
[8:46] 7:34. So I am made to possess months of
[8:49] vanity and weariesome nights, not
[8:52] restful nights. Oh, thank goodness the
[8:54] We say like this. The baby finally slept
[8:56] through the night or my 5-year-old
[8:58] finally slept through the night. Right,
[8:59] Z? He does a good job every night. But
[9:02] you know, we we get upset if we have a
[9:04] couple nights we don't get all the
[9:05] sleep. Chris and I were texting about
[9:06] that. I wasn't getting good sleep last
[9:07] week. Chris said, "How you sleeping?"
[9:08] I'm like, "Much better, brother. Thank
[9:10] you." But Job didn't have restful
[9:13] nights. He had weary nights on top of
[9:16] everything else, the other four layers.
[9:20] When I lie down, I say, "When shall I
[9:22] arise?" And the night be gone. So as
[9:24] soon as he's down, he's like, "I'd just
[9:26] like to get up."
[9:28] In other words, there's no hope for rest
[9:31] and the night be gone. I'm full of
[9:33] tossings to and fro until the dawning of
[9:35] the day. And remember church again,
[9:39] God said he was a perfect man that is
[9:43] skewed evil. In other words, he really
[9:45] didn't deserve all this.
[9:48] &gt;&gt; God was not angry with him.
[9:51] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[9:52] &gt;&gt; God was not wroth with Job.
[9:55] &gt;&gt; It was a test of his love and character.
[9:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:00] &gt;&gt; Now, did he have daily sins? Yes. I've
[10:02] gone over that. I'll just go over it
[10:03] briefly again tonight. He had daily sins
[10:04] just like you and I. But he constantly
[10:07] applied the blood.
[10:10] &gt;&gt; Just a reminder, Ro, as Rod has told
[10:12] some of you, if you got a tough
[10:14] situation, apply the blood.
[10:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Chris.
[10:22] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. And that's exactly what he did
[10:24] in chapter one. It said he got up early
[10:26] every morning to sacrifice.
[10:29] Yes, sir. Good question, brother. Yes.
[10:32] Job 7:13 and 14
[10:35] when I say my bed shall comfort me, my
[10:37] couch shall ease my complaint. So at
[10:39] least we can say, "Well, at least I can
[10:40] lay down tonight on a nice mattress I
[10:42] just bought."
[10:44] Or somebody gave me a nice mattress.
[10:46] Finally, at least I can lay down on a
[10:48] nice mattress. Job could not say that.
[10:51] Then thou scares me with dreams and
[10:53] terrifies me through visions.
[10:56] Now again, he's got it wrong here. It
[10:58] wasn't God that was doing that.
[11:01] He's he's applying this to God.
[11:04] And that's one reason God rebukes him at
[11:06] the end. But church, let's give him some
[11:08] grace. He said a lot of wrong things,
[11:10] but he wasn't sleeping well.
[11:13] &gt;&gt; The Bible said he was full of confusion.
[11:18] &gt;&gt; How many people have ever stayed up for
[11:19] days on end? Not me. I've never have. If
[11:21] you stayed up days on end, Brother
[11:22] Chris. Well, by the end, you're like,
[11:24] you know, if you're not taking drugs, by
[11:26] the end, you know, you could be so
[11:29] confused and then all the pain and then
[11:31] the funerals and then having no no
[11:33] money.
[11:35] Think about people that wander Akan or
[11:37] they wander San Francisco.
[11:40] Very similar type of mindset. So, I just
[11:42] say like this. It was just God's grace
[11:44] that he didn't say the wrong thing.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; Something that he could not be forgiven
[11:49] of. And thank God, God has kept you and
[11:52] I from saying things we wish we never
[11:54] said. Hallelujah.
[11:56] &gt;&gt; And our trials are less in comparison to
[11:58] his.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; Check out uh in your Bible Job 3:17.
[12:09] &gt;&gt; Even he felt this pain, church, not just
[12:11] on his soores, in his bones.
[12:15] My bones are pierced in me in the night
[12:18] season and my sinnus take no rest. So
[12:21] the ligaments or we'd say the blood
[12:23] vessels,
[12:24] uh the joints, everything was painful.
[12:27] There wasn't a spot, brother Austin,
[12:29] where he wasn't having some type of a
[12:30] physical pain.
[12:32] Soon as he laid down, it's like, can I
[12:34] get up? Soon as he's up, I wish I could
[12:35] lay down. And then when he got to sleep,
[12:37] he had bad dreams.
[12:42] So again, who do you know that's on this
[12:45] level? Nobody I know.
[12:49] So let's take courage from that. Praise
[12:51] God. Hallelujah. Let's take courage.
[12:54] And remember, this was this was a test
[12:57] given to the greatest believer. We'd
[12:59] say, or I'll say like this, maybe a
[13:01] better word, the most humble believer,
[13:03] the most obedient believer of his day.
[13:07] And he went through all this and still
[13:09] never cursed God. And he still had never
[13:12] seen God.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; He'd only heard about God. Oh, but
[13:16] what's the Bible say, Brother Rod? Faith
[13:18] cometh by.
[13:20] Amen. Job had faith because he heard the
[13:23] word of God. Hallelujah.
[13:26] &gt;&gt; He never seen God. He never saw a
[13:28] supernatural miracle. We'd say it's some
[13:30] great thing. He never talked to God face
[13:32] to face. He never saw the theophony of
[13:34] God. We'd say, "Hallelujah." Now, he had
[13:38] visions, right? Oh, yeah. He did have
[13:39] visions in the midst of the trial.
[13:40] That's right. He did have, but we don't
[13:41] know what he saw beforehand because at
[13:43] the end, he says, "Now I see."
[13:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[13:46] &gt;&gt; Right. Now, I see. So, before he didn't
[13:49] see the picture the right way.
[13:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[13:54] &gt;&gt; This is a a test, a true test of faith
[13:59] that he went through. And that was the
[14:02] whole test. Brother Chris, Satan said,
[14:04] "Well, you're only you he is only
[14:06] serving you because you're blessing him.
[14:08] You're packing his wallet and his bank
[14:10] account. That's the only reason he's
[14:11] loving you." And then when that failed,
[14:14] he said, "Well, he's got good health. If
[14:16] you take away his health, he'll curse
[14:17] you."
[14:19] Now, Job never cursed God, but church,
[14:21] he did exalt himself above God.
[14:25] &gt;&gt; But God didn't put that on the same
[14:27] level as a curse.
[14:29] &gt;&gt; That's totally scriptural. So, let's get
[14:31] your Bibles ready. We'll try to get some
[14:32] of those here by God's grace. We'll see
[14:34] how far we can get.
[14:36] So, Job had five levels of suffering
[14:39] that you and I really know nothing
[14:41] about.
[14:43] In fact, I don't even know if I have can
[14:45] ever say any of those five levels. I've
[14:47] always have never suffered for months on
[14:49] end.
[14:51] I have all my children. Thank God. We
[14:52] still have finances. I have my health
[14:54] and I sleep pretty well. So, I haven't
[14:56] suffered on any of those realms.
[14:59] But then when I go through a trial,
[15:00] brother Chris, I'm like, "Oh, God." Like
[15:01] I'm crying out like I'm going to die or
[15:03] something like that or I get worried if
[15:05] somebody threatens me this or threat and
[15:07] I forget I forget all the the trials
[15:10] that Job went through and still he says
[15:14] the Lord gives the Lord takes away.
[15:15] Still he said let's bless the name of
[15:17] the Lord.
[15:18] &gt;&gt; That's why church in the midst of your
[15:20] hardest trial just come to church and
[15:23] bless the Lord. Hallelujah. You might
[15:25] spend Monday, Tuesday all discouraged,
[15:28] but come Wednesday night and just let
[15:30] God anoint you to say, "Bless the Lord."
[15:32] Hallelujah. I'm still here. I still made
[15:34] it. I still got this. I still got that.
[15:36] I'm not like Job. I ought to bless God.
[15:38] Hallelujah.
[15:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:40] &gt;&gt; Or maybe Thursday, Friday, Saturday is
[15:42] awful. But just come Sunday and just
[15:44] bless the Lord for he is good for his
[15:47] mercy endureth forever.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; It'll turn your whole situation around.
[15:52] Hallelujah. change your whole
[15:54] perspective
[15:55] &gt;&gt; when you talk about the goodness of God.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:00] &gt;&gt; Now I uh for time's sake, yeah, I better
[16:02] just go to Job's I I could well I'll
[16:05] just rehearse real quickly Job's
[16:06] positives.
[16:08] Job uh brother Chris Job in Job 1 vers5.
[16:11] He prayed every morning and made
[16:13] sacrifice for his children early in the
[16:15] morning. He got up early. Church, you
[16:17] men and women, you want to be men and
[16:19] women of God, you got to get up early.
[16:22] Jesus got up early
[16:24] &gt;&gt; and remember and I want Rod to testify.
[16:26] That's right. But I need to get your
[16:27] your testimony on the schedule, brother.
[16:28] I'm so glad you're here tonight. Praise
[16:30] God. We got to hear that. We heard
[16:32] Adam's testimony. We heard David's
[16:34] testimony. Look, church. Crack cocaine,
[16:36] marijuana, alcohol, porn cannot stop a
[16:40] child of God. Hallelujah.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:44] &gt;&gt; It's going to fall off eventually. Just
[16:45] seek God with all your heart.
[16:47] Hallelujah. Amen.
[16:49] &gt;&gt; And we need to hear from brother Rod as
[16:51] well what God has done in his life. I'm
[16:52] excited to hear more about that as well
[16:54] by God's grace. Hallelujah.
[16:57] And just just as a pre quick preview,
[16:59] Brother Rod felt led of the Lord to
[17:01] leave and move almost twos away just to
[17:05] support a preacher
[17:08] and leave everything dear to him.
[17:11] &gt;&gt; Well, we've got family like that. Austin
[17:13] did that.
[17:15] So that's part of Rod's testimony.
[17:17] Brother Chris, and you came back too,
[17:19] buddy. Hallelujah.
[17:20] But leave everything just to support the
[17:23] word of God. Hallelujah. It's like the
[17:25] queen of the south. Amen.
[17:27] &gt;&gt; Leaving everything in order to support
[17:30] the word of God. Hallelujah.
[17:33] &gt;&gt; Very few people will ever do that, but
[17:35] God has anointed our brother to do that.
[17:39] Hallelujah.
[17:41] She got up early, every morning early to
[17:43] pray and make sacrifices.
[17:47] Uh, he lived for others. Now, we're not
[17:49] going to read these, but he helped the
[17:50] widows in Job 29:13. He helped the
[17:53] fatherless in Job 29:12. He loved his
[17:56] enemies in Job 31:29. He didn't trust in
[17:59] his riches. As rich as he was, he
[18:01] actually didn't trust in that. That's
[18:02] why he could still praise God when he
[18:04] lost it. Amen.
[18:06] &gt;&gt; That was in Job 31:24 and 25. And he
[18:10] helped strangers. He let strangers live
[18:12] in his mansion.
[18:14] He he would have had a a mansion.
[18:17] &gt;&gt; Now, I would say that's well it's easy
[18:18] for you to let people stay if you got a
[18:20] mansion. If I had a hotel, brother
[18:21] Austin, I'd let a lot of people stay in
[18:22] the rooms, you know, right? If I was a
[18:24] rich man like that, it's different when
[18:26] your house is jam-packed to the corners
[18:29] and you got b lots of four or five bunk
[18:31] beds in your house. But that's just like
[18:33] the old days. Amen. They had small
[18:35] houses, but buck buck beds all around
[18:37] the the rooms. Hallelujah.
[18:41] That's right. stuff on the floor, the
[18:43] dirt floor.
[18:46] And he overcame like brother Adam's
[18:47] testimony, he overcame the sexual mind
[18:50] battles in Job 31 verse 1, N, and 10. He
[18:53] wouldn't even look at a woman that
[18:54] wasn't his wife.
[18:56] &gt;&gt; And God looked down and said, "That's a
[18:58] perfect man."
[19:00] &gt;&gt; Now, perfect doesn't mean sinless.
[19:02] Perfect means you're undefiled and
[19:05] you've confessed all your sins.
[19:07] &gt;&gt; It also means pious, which means you're
[19:08] really religious. You honor God. You
[19:11] fear the Lord. you keep his commands. In
[19:13] other words, Job faithfully made the
[19:16] sacrifices, right? Faithfully put all
[19:18] these sins under the blood every day.
[19:20] Faithfully tried to serve God. That's
[19:22] what made him a perfect man. Hallelujah.
[19:25] Look, he said, if I've done wrong, he
[19:26] said, then let my wife be given to
[19:28] another.
[19:30] But he said, I haven't done that. What a
[19:31] statement to make in the presence of
[19:32] God. Hallelujah.
[19:34] See, he knew. He knew he kept the word
[19:37] of God.
[19:40] He was just confused and didn't
[19:42] understand. Why would God allow me this
[19:44] five-fold test, which I don't know
[19:47] anyone who's battled all five of those.
[19:51] Hallelujah.
[19:53] And then one thing we got to remember,
[19:55] God called him perfect. God called him
[19:58] the most holy man in his generation.
[20:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:02] And remember, he was he was the closest
[20:05] man to God, but he still never had a
[20:07] great dream or vision as far as we know.
[20:09] Never heard from God, in other words.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; So, that ought to encourage you too,
[20:13] church. You can be close to God without
[20:15] having as many experiences as other
[20:17] people.
[20:19] &gt;&gt; Right?
[20:20] &gt;&gt; It's that that's the that's one of the
[20:22] main thoughts I want to bring out here.
[20:23] He said, "I've heard, but now I see."
[20:25] Well, just in the hearing, he was the
[20:28] greatest man on the earth.
[20:30] just in hearing.
[20:33] &gt;&gt; He He couldn't He couldn't brag, brother
[20:34] Rod about, well, I had that vision that
[20:36] last year. This year I've had three
[20:37] visions and then God talked to me that
[20:39] he couldn't brag on that. He hadn't seen
[20:41] God. Hallelujah.
[20:42] &gt;&gt; He just knowed the word.
[20:45] So church, if you know the word, you're
[20:47] a blessed individual.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; And you can still live close to God if
[20:51] you've just heard the word of God. Do
[20:52] you brothers believe that? Brother
[20:53] Patrick Claw, do you believe that? If
[20:56] you just obey the word of God, you can
[20:58] be great in the sight of God. You We'll
[21:01] never be great in the sight of the
[21:02] world. We don't have to care about that.
[21:04] We want to be great in the sight of God.
[21:06] Hallelujah.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; To live a godly, pure life. Hallelujah.
[21:15] Okay. About 20 minutes. Okay. Perfect.
[21:18] Now, I just want to show just some of
[21:20] his failures. In Job 3:25,
[21:23] he said everything he feared came upon
[21:26] him.
[21:28] So in other words, Job struggled with
[21:30] fear. I'm going to lose it all. I'm
[21:32] going to lose my kids. I'm going to lose
[21:33] my money. I'm going to lose my health.
[21:34] So at some point,
[21:36] see, he greatly feared this. So at some
[21:38] point, although he was worshiping, there
[21:41] was times he let fear come in.
[21:43] &gt;&gt; But yeah, members church, the whole
[21:44] time, God said, "He's perfect."
[21:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. In other words, we're
[21:50] all going to have mind battles. We're
[21:51] all going to fear about the future. Just
[21:53] keep worshiping God.
[21:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; Just keep making the right sacrifices.
[21:58] Hallelujah. Just keep obeying the word
[22:00] of God. Hallelujah.
[22:04] &gt;&gt; And again, church. In other words, he
[22:06] feared he feared the hardest temptation
[22:08] there would ever come and it came upon
[22:10] him. But again, I don't know anyone that
[22:13] this has come upon that's ever had to
[22:16] deal with this like he did. Hallelujah.
[22:20] Here's where Job made a mistake. He
[22:22] said, "God puts no trust in his servants
[22:25] in Job 4:18." Look at this. Job
[22:28] suffering so much. He's like, "God
[22:30] doesn't trust any of his servants.
[22:34] He put no trust in his servants." But
[22:36] that's exactly the opposite of what was
[22:38] true. God told Satan, "I trust him. He
[22:42] won't deny me." God trusts you.
[22:44] Hallelujah.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; In other words, he knows the beginning
[22:47] from the end. He knows you're going to
[22:49] serve him because you love him and you
[22:51] believe the truth. Hallelujah.
[22:55] &gt;&gt; See, our trials will make us say things
[22:57] we don't even mean. Our trials, if we
[22:59] don't overcome them, it'll make us say
[23:01] things that disagree with God's word.
[23:03] But yet, God is still faithful to
[23:04] forgive us
[23:07] &gt;&gt; because he sees the beginning from the
[23:09] end.
[23:12] He tells us he was speaking out of a
[23:14] bitter soul because this fivelevel
[23:19] trial in Job 7:11.
[23:25] Therefore, I will not refrain my mouth.
[23:26] I will speak in the anguish of my
[23:28] spirit. So, he's speaking from his
[23:30] sorrow. He's battled all these things
[23:33] for so months. He's speaking just from a
[23:35] he's a wounded soldier, we'd say. And I
[23:38] will complain. So he even goes as far as
[23:40] saying, "I'm complaining because I don't
[23:42] understand this."
[23:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But does God hold him
[23:47] against it? No. God doesn't hold him
[23:49] against it. Does God bring correction to
[23:51] him? Yes. That's what every good father
[23:53] will do. Bring correction. Hallelujah.
[23:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:57] &gt;&gt; But God doesn't hold this against him.
[23:59] As far as like, oh, you're lost or
[24:01] you're done. I'm never going to send my
[24:03] anointing. I'm never going to restore
[24:04] your joy. I'm never going to bring back
[24:06] all these things. God couldn't wait to
[24:08] bring it back.
[24:10] Right? As soon as Job confessed, uh,
[24:12] he's like telling those three friends,
[24:13] "Okay, go go have Job pray for you." And
[24:16] then as soon as that, God accepts Job
[24:18] and God starts blessing him right over
[24:19] again.
[24:21] Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen.
[24:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:26] He's full of confusion in Job 10 verse1
[24:28] 15, if you have your Bible.
[24:32] If I be wicked, woe to me. And if I be
[24:34] righteous, yet I will not lift up my
[24:35] head. I'm full of confusion.
[24:39] Yeah, if you just you if you and I just
[24:41] miss sleep for one night, we'll be full
[24:42] of confusion. I know I will be. That's
[24:44] what I'm talking I'm talking about for
[24:45] myself.
[24:47] Can barely make it through the day,
[24:48] wonder around tripping over things,
[24:51] saying things I ought not to say, just
[24:53] it just comes out of my mouth.
[24:55] &gt;&gt; I not even know it's gonna not even know
[24:57] I'm going to say it. Just tired,
[24:59] confused. But not notice here, Job did
[25:02] say there was times he got lazy on God.
[25:05] Job 16:12. So again, church,
[25:10] try to take courage from this. We're
[25:12] going to get lazy on God. Sometimes
[25:14] we're going to fear, but just keep
[25:15] worshiping. Just keep praying. Just keep
[25:18] giving God glory. God will forgive us.
[25:20] He'll help us. Hallelujah.
[25:23] &gt;&gt; I was at ease. So Job took a little
[25:25] break, Brother Chris. There must been a
[25:26] little time. He took a little spiritual
[25:27] break. I was at ease. Things were too
[25:29] easy for me. He no doubt he was rich.
[25:33] But he hath broken me aunder. He hath
[25:35] also taken me by my neck and shaken me
[25:37] to pieces and set me up for his mark.
[25:39] Now, did God do that? No. So, here's the
[25:40] another wrong statement. The the God
[25:43] allowed the enemy to do that. It wasn't
[25:46] God shaking him up. God will not tempt
[25:49] any man,
[25:51] but God will allow us to be tempted. And
[25:53] he'll never, as my remember I ended last
[25:56] Wednesday night, God will never allow us
[25:58] a temptation that we cannot handle.
[26:00] &gt;&gt; In other words, you can win every
[26:02] wrestling match. Amen.
[26:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:05] &gt;&gt; You can win every wrestling match cuz
[26:07] that's what it is. We wrestle not
[26:08] against flesh and blood. Amen. Brother
[26:10] Ram said it's not a flesh and blood
[26:12] affair. Hallelujah.
[26:14] &gt;&gt; You got to win the wrestling match of
[26:15] prayer. The wrestling match of speaking
[26:17] God's word. The wrestling match of
[26:19] trusting in God.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:22] &gt;&gt; Trusting thus sayith the Lord.
[26:25] If we trust thus sayith the Lord, we're
[26:26] going to win the match.
[26:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:34] church. So again, no man's perfect as
[26:36] far as what we when we think perfect. It
[26:38] means uh mature, right? It means uh
[26:41] forgiven. It means undefiled. You've
[26:43] confessed all your sins. You're Oh, it
[26:45] also means upright. Amen. You're living
[26:47] upright. You're doing the right thing,
[26:49] not the wrong thing.
[26:52] &gt;&gt; And church. Oh, yeah. Here's another
[26:53] one. Uh and then he says, "I'm an enemy
[26:55] of God." In Job uh 19:11, look at those
[26:58] fingers. Lightning fingers back there.
[27:01] Heath also, now look, he says, "God has
[27:03] kindled his wrath against me." So,
[27:05] brother Austin, when he would pray, he
[27:06] would imagine God just angry with him.
[27:09] Can't wait to get back on him or
[27:10] something like that. And that wasn't at
[27:12] all. God's bragging on him in heaven.
[27:14] Have you considered Job? There's nobody
[27:17] like Job in heaven. There's nobody like
[27:19] Malachi on earth. Put yourself in there.
[27:22] There's nobody like Sister Kristen.
[27:25] But yet, he's looking up, Brother
[27:26] Christian. He's like, "God's angry at
[27:28] me. He's pouring out his wrath on me."
[27:29] He's wrong. God wasn't doing that.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; And how many times, church, do we get
[27:34] upset with God? Like, this isn't turning
[27:36] out like I wanted it to.
[27:39] &gt;&gt; God must be angry with me.
[27:41] &gt;&gt; Now, there could be a time where God is
[27:43] angry at us because of iniquity, right?
[27:46] &gt;&gt; But it's not every time. If we've
[27:48] confessed that, then we're forgiven.
[27:50] Now, there might be consequences, but
[27:52] let's say the consequences have already
[27:53] done and and now we're living pure
[27:55] before God and we have trials. Well,
[27:57] it's a test of our character.
[27:58] Hallelujah. Amen.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; Pro it could be God proving our
[28:02] character to the devil or as we saw with
[28:04] Job also, God was proving Job's
[28:07] character to Job.
[28:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he said, "I abhore myself.
[28:12] I hate myself and I repent in dust and
[28:15] ashes."
[28:18] &gt;&gt; All right. Now,
[28:21] let's look at real quick at Aahu. Elahu
[28:24] is watching this whole situation, right?
[28:26] He's a young man. That's that's the
[28:28] scripture that uh uh Brian opened up
[28:30] with Elahu. He lets Job go back and
[28:32] forth. Job does most of the talking with
[28:34] those three friends anyway. And he waits
[28:36] till they're all done. Then he says,
[28:37] "I've got the spirit of the Lord on me.
[28:38] My belly is like wine. I It's going to
[28:41] burst. I got to say these things. I've
[28:44] waited. I'm I'm I'm the youngest here
[28:46] and I know wisdom is in age, but
[28:48] everybody here is saying things wrong."
[28:50] Hallelujah.
[28:51] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let me speak for God."
[28:54] Hallelujah. And Brian tried to encourage
[28:55] these young girls. You can speak for
[28:57] God. You brothers can speak for God,
[28:58] too. Malachi, you young, all you young
[29:00] sisters, young brothers, you can speak
[29:02] for God, too. Just wait for your
[29:03] anointing.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; Just wait for the leading of the Holy
[29:06] Ghost.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:16] &gt;&gt; So, uh I guess I'll just hit the
[29:18] highlights here. Let's go to uh Job 32:1
[29:22] and2, honey. 321 and2. I'll just hit the
[29:25] highlights.
[29:28] So these three men ceased to answer Job
[29:30] because he was righteous in his own
[29:31] eyes. Okay, we'll see it later. God even
[29:34] says this too. Then was kindled the
[29:36] wrath of Aahu, the son of Berichel, the
[29:38] buzzite of the kindred of Ram. Against
[29:41] Job was his wrath kindled because he
[29:43] justified himself rather than God.
[29:48] So in Job's words, he was making himself
[29:52] like like God did wrong to me.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; Why didn't God do right for me? I'm the
[29:58] victim.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; It's God's fault.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; And Elahu is like, I'm angry now. I'm
[30:06] going to tell you I'm going to tell you
[30:07] what God feels. Right? Hallelujah.
[30:14] Just for the time sake, go to Job 34:5.
[30:18] Job says God had taken away his judgment
[30:21] and that was wrong. Look what Elahu
[30:23] says. For Job has said, I am righteous
[30:26] and God has taken away my judgment. Did
[30:28] God take away the judgment of Job? Of
[30:30] course not.
[30:32] No. But Job had felt that God taken away
[30:36] the judgment and God wasn't judging his
[30:38] situation the right way.
[30:40] Listen friends, God's a potter. God can
[30:43] do whatever he wants with his clay.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; Just like you, Brother Chris, and
[30:47] Brother Austin, you got your your your
[30:48] your vessels, your bowls, right? Your
[30:50] your plates, your cups now in your
[30:52] apartment. You can do whatever you want
[30:53] with them because they're yours.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; You paid for them fair and square. Or
[30:58] they were given to you fair and square.
[30:59] Well, isn't God greater than you and I?
[31:02] &gt;&gt; If we put something through, if we put
[31:05] something through a difficult time, it's
[31:06] still our vessel, right?
[31:09] uh we leave our vessel out in the car
[31:10] for a few weeks. It's going to be pretty
[31:12] nasty, right? But we got to bring it in,
[31:14] get it cleaned out, and I can use it
[31:16] again, but it's still mine. Praise God.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; And that's what God's allowing here.
[31:20] God's allowing Job to be tested, but Job
[31:23] still belongs to God. Hallelujah.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:28] Now, go to verse 7 and 34. He said, Job
[31:32] is being scornful, which means he has
[31:34] disdain towards God. What is a man like
[31:36] Job who drinkketh up scorning like
[31:38] water?
[31:39] So he's just he's just drinking in all
[31:41] the scorn. Like he's just saying too
[31:43] many words against God.
[31:46] Uh go to 349 and 10.
[31:49] He uh Job said it's no profit to serve
[31:52] God for he has said it profit a man
[31:53] nothing that he should delight himself
[31:55] with God. Now stop right there. Job
[31:57] would have said it it's not going to
[31:59] help you at all, brother Rod, to come to
[32:00] church. It's not going to help you at
[32:01] all to read your Bible. That's basically
[32:03] what Job said.
[32:06] Now, when was the last time you said
[32:07] that? You don't have to raise your hand.
[32:10] But did you ever say, "Ah, it doesn't
[32:11] help to go to church." Well, if you did,
[32:13] now you're on the same level as Job,
[32:14] right? You've done the same wrong as
[32:15] Job. Doesn't help me to read my Bible.
[32:18] Well, you just said what Job said, and
[32:20] you you haven't had as hard as trials as
[32:22] Job.
[32:23] &gt;&gt; Now, is is our day more deceptive? Yes.
[32:26] But you haven't gone through the
[32:27] physical suffering that he went through.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; And I would say even the emotional
[32:31] suffering. There's there's no way,
[32:34] right? Therefore, hearken unto me, ye
[32:36] men of understanding, far be from God,
[32:38] that he should do wickedness and from
[32:40] the Almighty that he should commit
[32:41] iniquity. So, Job is basically saying
[32:43] God's committing iniquity because Elahu
[32:46] is rebuking Job for his iniquity.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; Everybody see that?
[32:54] &gt;&gt; In other words, Job's basically saying,
[32:55] "God did wrong with me." He's not
[32:57] judging my situation the right way. It
[33:00] doesn't do any doesn't help you if you
[33:02] delight in God. Doesn't do any good.
[33:04] Haven if you praise your praise God,
[33:05] raise your hands and sing and happy and
[33:07] and dance and shout for Jesus. It don't
[33:09] do you any good. That's what Job was
[33:10] saying.
[33:12] Oh, but it does do good. Amen.
[33:15] Hallelujah. Amen. It does do good to
[33:17] sing to God. It does do good to dance
[33:20] for God. Hallelujah. You get under the
[33:22] anointing. Hallelujah. You get anointed
[33:23] and the Bible said it refreshes your
[33:25] spirit.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:28] &gt;&gt; Last Wednesday, I didn't plan it. I
[33:29] dance all around here, Austin. Last
[33:31] Wednesday, I danced all around here to
[33:32] the first song. I didn't plan it.
[33:33] Something just struck me and I just
[33:34] started dancing. I could sing of your
[33:36] love forever. I felt so good afterwards.
[33:38] I'm boy, I really needed that one.
[33:39] Praise God. It It's refreshment. Praise
[33:43] God.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; And then I live better after that.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; I live closer to God. Hallelujah.
[33:51] But look, even a even a man who's the
[33:53] greatest man on earth can say the wrong
[33:55] things about God.
[34:00] And then the Bible said Job condemned
[34:02] God in 34:17. Now look at this scripture
[34:06] 34:17. Shall even he that hateth right
[34:09] govern and wilt thou condemn him that is
[34:11] most just? Elahu who's got he's like
[34:13] Christ. He's like a type of Christ
[34:15] bringing the judgment of God in flesh.
[34:18] He tells Job, he said, "How can you
[34:20] condemn the most just God?"
[34:23] So all Job's complaining was almost
[34:26] condemning God as being unfair.
[34:29] He He judged it wrong. Church, as hard
[34:33] as trials as we go through in life, you
[34:35] can be assured God has always judged it
[34:37] right.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; And it might be hard for us in our human
[34:41] condition to say, uh, you know, this per
[34:44] we lost this person or we went through
[34:45] this suffering. It might be hard to say
[34:47] all things work together for good. But
[34:49] all things work together for good. Amen.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; You'll find out later, either this side
[34:55] or the next side. You'll find out later
[34:57] that all things work together for good
[34:59] &gt;&gt; to them that love the Lord.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:06] So, Job is guilty by the spirit of God.
[35:10] Elahu said, "I'm anointed from the
[35:11] Almighty to bring rebuke."
[35:14] He's guilty of condemning God. Now,
[35:16] church, I've heard one person in this
[35:18] message say, "I hate I hate God." It was
[35:21] a woman who used to go to church here.
[35:22] She hated God because uh she wasn't
[35:25] couldn't be a preacher and because she
[35:27] wasn't married yet. And I told her, I
[35:29] said, "Sister, you need to repent of
[35:31] that." And she and she even told it to
[35:33] my face. We're standing outside the
[35:34] church one time at the other location.
[35:36] She said, "I hate God." I'm like, "What?
[35:38] Well, no wonder you're sitting like that
[35:39] in church, not praising God, not
[35:41] worshiping God. No joy."
[35:45] Think about that. But I thought, "Well,
[35:46] well, I've seen that. I mean, I've seen
[35:48] that somewhere. That's in the Bible."
[35:50] Now, Job never hated God, but Job said
[35:53] God did wrong. And so, that's what
[35:55] basically this sister was saying. God
[35:56] did wrong. I'm not uh he don't let women
[35:59] preach and he uh hasn't given me a
[36:02] husband yet. Isn't that something? And
[36:04] claim to believe this message. So, God
[36:06] will work that situation out. God will
[36:08] be the judge of that.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; But I'm just letting you know, I've
[36:11] rarely seen anybody suffer. And that
[36:13] sister never suffered on any of these
[36:15] levels
[36:16] &gt;&gt; that Job had. None of them.
[36:20] But what I want you to know is that
[36:21] we'll say things, church, and if if
[36:24] we're sincere, then then God will
[36:26] forgive us. But if we're truly servants
[36:28] of God, we'll be like Job and say, "I
[36:30] hate that I said that."
[36:32] &gt;&gt; Right? He said, "I hate myself." In
[36:34] other words, I hate my sin nature. I
[36:36] can't wait to get a theophony.
[36:38] Hallelujah. Amen. I can't wait to get a
[36:40] word body where I don't act like this. I
[36:42] don't say things like this. Where I can
[36:43] be a real believer all the time.
[36:45] Hallelujah.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; In other words, I don't sin every day.
[36:52] And look what Job rebukes I'm sorry.
[36:54] Look what Elahu rebukes him on in Job uh
[36:56] 3435
[36:58] 36 and 37.
[37:00] Elahu says he's rebelled against God.
[37:03] Job, this perfect man up in heaven. Now
[37:05] church, that ought to tell us something.
[37:07] The blood of Jesus Christ in heaven
[37:09] forgives us of our rebellion here on
[37:11] earth.
[37:13] Everybody catch that. Job's sin was
[37:15] rebelling. He was saying things against
[37:17] God that were right. But God in heaven
[37:19] is still calling him. He's my servant.
[37:21] He's the most He hates evil. He escapes
[37:24] evil.
[37:25] Hallelujah.
[37:27] See that? See the power of the blood
[37:29] sacrifice. Does everybody see that? The
[37:32] blood covers all your rebellion to the
[37:33] word of God.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. The blood covers all my
[37:37] rebellion, all your re rebellion to the
[37:39] word of God.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; Every day we rebel against God somehow,
[37:42] right? None of us are perfect, but the
[37:44] blood of Christ still forgives our
[37:46] rebellion.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; Job has spoken without knowledge, and
[37:51] his words were without wisdom. My desire
[37:53] is that Job may be tried unto the end
[37:54] because of his answers for wicked men.
[37:56] For he hath added rebellion unto his
[37:59] sin. This is Elahu speaking by the word
[38:01] of the Lord.
[38:03] For he uh he clapth his hands among us,
[38:05] and multiplyth his words against God. So
[38:09] God's up here telling the devil, "Look
[38:10] at this man. He's a great man. Look at
[38:12] this great man. God saying good things
[38:13] about him, Brother Austin. But then Job
[38:15] is saying bad things about God. And this
[38:18] is a God who forgives. This is the God
[38:20] of love.
[38:22] Hallelujah. Amen. Can everybody see
[38:25] that? He's a loving God because he'll
[38:28] he'll let his believers even say words
[38:30] against him and still forgive it because
[38:32] he loves them. Amen.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; In other words, brothers and sisters, no
[38:37] matter how many times we stumble, if we
[38:39] just re repent, if we just ask God to
[38:41] forgive us, God will forgive us.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:48] You might say, "I spoke against God. I
[38:49] rebelled against God. There's no hope
[38:50] for me." No, there is hope for you
[38:52] because there was hope for Job.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[38:59] Hallelujah.
[39:03] again. Uh
[39:06] yeah, Job later agrees with this. Uh go
[39:08] to Job 42:3. Job Job totally agrees that
[39:11] he spoke without knowledge. Uh 423. Who
[39:14] is he that hideth counsel without
[39:15] knowledge? Therefore, I have uttered
[39:16] that I understood not things too
[39:18] wonderful me which I knew not. So see, I
[39:21] I said things I didn't understand. So
[39:24] when you go to the end of the story,
[39:25] Job's like, "You're right, Elahu. I said
[39:28] so many things I had no idea what I was
[39:30] saying.
[39:32] I rebelled against God. I hate myself. I
[39:34] abhore myself
[39:37] &gt;&gt; because of what I've said against God.
[39:39] And George, these were just words. He
[39:41] didn't sleep with anybody's wife.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; Right? He didn't commit sexual sin. He
[39:45] just spoke evil words.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; And yet, he hated himself because of his
[39:50] evil words that he uttered.
[39:53] See, that shows you're a real Christian
[39:55] when you're so ashamed of your sin that
[39:57] you you say, "Oh, I hate my sin. I hate
[39:59] my sin. I just want to be forgiven. God,
[40:02] forgive me. God, restore my joy. Amen.
[40:04] Lord, restore restore the words that
[40:06] come out of my mouth. Help me just to
[40:08] say good things about you, God.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; And he wasn't guilty of sexual sin. He
[40:13] wasn't guilty of money embezzlement,
[40:15] right? He wasn't guilty of all these
[40:18] things. It was mostly his words.
[40:23] My
[40:25] then said Job was more righteous. Oh
[40:27] yeah. He said he was more righteous than
[40:28] God's righteousness in Job 351 2 and3.
[40:32] And I'm about ready to close here. I'm
[40:33] coming up to the end here. I didn't get
[40:35] to where I wanted to go, but we'll see.
[40:36] I may preaching Sunday. Elahu spake
[40:39] moreover and said, "Thinkest thou this
[40:40] to be right that thou says my
[40:42] righteousness is more than God." So
[40:43] look, he brother Rod, he exalted himself
[40:46] greater than God.
[40:48] And that's what these preachers, we we
[40:50] know preachers say that they call
[40:51] themselves the greatest of all time. And
[40:53] that and they don't even understand.
[40:54] They're they're actually saying they're
[40:55] greater than Jesus when they say all
[40:57] time because he was a prophet on this
[40:59] earth. Now, he was a God prophet, but he
[41:01] was still a prophet on this earth. They
[41:03] don't even realize it. Now, can they be
[41:05] forgiven and saved? Yes, because Job
[41:07] was.
[41:09] Everybody see that?
[41:11] That making sense? He Job said, "I am
[41:15] more righteous than God."
[41:21] In other words, I know more about it
[41:23] than God.
[41:25] I know what's right more than God.
[41:28] For thou hast said, "What advantage will
[41:30] it be unto thee? And what profit shall I
[41:32] have if I be cleansed from my sin?" What
[41:34] do I gain? Even if God does forgive me,
[41:36] what do I gain? I'm suffering. I'm doing
[41:38] all these things. This was uttered by
[41:41] the greatest man according to God.
[41:45] Hallelujah. Oh, that makes me just makes
[41:47] me so humbled
[41:49] that God could look down and call this
[41:51] man the greatest man
[41:54] because of the blood sacrifice.
[41:57] Hallelujah.
[41:59] So, he says he's more righteous than
[42:01] God.
[42:05] And let me I'll just close with this
[42:06] thought because I just I'll take about a
[42:08] couple more minutes here.
[42:12] Yeah, I'll just close with this here.
[42:17] Church,
[42:20] Job only knew God by hearing the
[42:23] preaching about God. He still hadn't
[42:25] seen God,
[42:27] right? Because faith comes by hearing.
[42:30] And Jesus said, "Greater is he who
[42:32] believeth on me and yet hasn't seen."
[42:38] So see, we get that revelation.
[42:41] How I'd like to see an angel, brother
[42:43] Claude. But it's actually I'd be greater
[42:45] in the sight of God if I didn't. Yet I
[42:48] still believed in angels. Thank God we
[42:50] can feel them. Hallelujah.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; But the Bible said the angels come to
[42:54] minister. And they came to give Jesus
[42:56] strength touched by an angel ministered
[43:00] uh by an angel.
[43:02] Right?
[43:04] We actually have greater faith if we
[43:07] don't see all these supernatural things
[43:09] than if we do see these supernatural
[43:11] things.
[43:13] And Job knew God by hearing, but he
[43:16] hadn't seen God.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; So before Job even saw God, before he
[43:22] even had this amazing miracle, we'd say,
[43:24] hearing from God out of a whirlwind, he
[43:27] was already perfect in the sight of God,
[43:28] he was already pious, upright, and
[43:31] undefiled.
[43:33] Hallelujah.
[43:37] And church, what is what do we find out
[43:38] here? Here's I want to I want to close
[43:40] with this. Let's keep this in mind. My
[43:42] last two verses. 2 Chronicles 16:9.
[43:46] In the story of Job, hallelujah. Glory.
[43:49] 2 Chronicles 16:9.
[43:52] In the story of Job, we get this
[43:54] understanding.
[43:57] Is it coming up? 2 Chronicles 16:9. I
[44:00] can turn there.
[44:04] I want to read it there. So, you got it.
[44:08] For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro
[44:11] throughout the whole earth to show
[44:13] himself strong in the behalf of them
[44:15] whose heart is perfect. Ah, there's Job.
[44:18] Amen.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Herein thou hast done foolishly.
[44:22] Therefore, from henceforth thou shalt
[44:24] have wars. Now, just keep that up there.
[44:26] Um, that's not referring to Job. That's
[44:29] referring to uh Asa, King Asa,
[44:34] rebuked by Haniah. Okay. But the point I
[44:37] want to make here is that for all of
[44:39] Job's life, he had never seen God. But
[44:42] brother Chris, every day the eyes of the
[44:44] Lord come looking for him. And every day
[44:48] the eyes found him on his knees. Brother
[44:50] Rod praying, "Oh God, forgive my
[44:52] children. If they did anything wrong, I
[44:54] worship you, God. Great is the Lord.
[44:55] Greatly to be praised. Lord, if anybody
[44:57] does ever wrong, forgive them, Lord
[44:59] Jesus. Forgive them." By by the grace of
[45:01] God, every day the eyes of the Lord saw
[45:03] him.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen.
[45:07] Hallelujah. Church, God's going to come
[45:09] looking tomorrow in your apartment or in
[45:10] your home to see how you're serving him.
[45:12] Because if you serve him right, he'll so
[45:14] show himself strong on your behalf.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; You know why that's so important,
[45:20] church? Why is this so important? God's
[45:23] eyes will find you serving him.
[45:25] Hallelujah. It'll make you perfect means
[45:28] upright. You're obedient.
[45:31] It's so important that the eyes of the
[45:33] Lord find you because they're going to
[45:34] and fro. But at the same time, Satan's
[45:37] going to and fro.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; Job 1 vers7, my last verse.
[45:45] The Lord said unto Satan, from whence
[45:46] cometh thou and S answered the Lord, he
[45:49] said, from going forth Akran and Kyogre
[45:51] Falls and Doylestown.
[45:54] The church said,
[45:57] &gt;&gt; oh, so what's that mean, brother Chris?
[45:59] That means every day the Lord comes
[46:01] looking to see if we're going to serve
[46:02] him. But the devil comes looking to see
[46:04] if we're not.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; And we better serve the Lord.
[46:08] Hallelujah.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; If we do, what does God God looks down
[46:12] from heaven say? That's my son. That's
[46:14] my daughter on their knees. Amen. And no
[46:17] matter what they go through, they've
[46:18] heard the word. Amen. Maybe they haven't
[46:20] seen Brother Ram's miracles or Brother
[46:22] Angley's miracles, which that those are
[46:24] ordained. Those are gifts of God
[46:26] ordained before the foundation world.
[46:28] But we're not any less, right? Because
[46:30] the Bible says if you believe and
[46:31] haven't seen, you're more blessed than
[46:33] they are. Praise God.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Now, God will give them reward based
[46:36] upon their labor. I'm not saying we get
[46:38] greater rewards, but there is some
[46:40] reward we get that they might not get.
[46:42] There is some blessing that we will get
[46:44] if we haven't seen those because God's
[46:46] eye seeing him. And how many want to do
[46:50] that today by the grace of God?
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand to our feet. Musicians
[46:54] can come.
[46:56] Satan's going to and fro in Akran, Kaoga
[47:00] Falls, Doylestown. Did I get all the
[47:02] towns here?
[47:05] And knowing that, we better make sure
[47:08] that we're worshiping and sacrificing
[47:11] every day to our Lord Jesus Christ
[47:14] because his eyes are looking, who can I
[47:16] show myself strong in?
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Can I show myself strong in brother
[47:20] Jesse's life today? Can I show myself
[47:22] strong in Malachi's life or Chris's life
[47:24] or Rod's life?
[47:26] or can I show myself strong for the new
[47:27] school year? And Claude and Patrick,
[47:29] amen, in the high school. Hallelujah.
[47:32] Every day his eyes are looking. Are they
[47:35] serving God? Do they want to overcome?
[47:37] Do they want to be true servants? Do
[47:39] they want to be perfect and upright?
[47:41] Church, God want God is here to help us
[47:43] have upright hearts.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Now, church, we don't aspire to be the
[47:51] greatest of all time, but I'll say it
[47:52] like this. We want to be as close to God
[47:54] as we possibly can.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Let me say like this. We want to get as
[47:58] many rewards as we can. We're not in
[48:00] this for the rewards, but we're in this
[48:02] to honor our Lord and Savior.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; And he likened the kingdom of God.
[48:07] Brother Rod knows. You know too, church.
[48:09] He likened the kingdom of God of saying,
[48:11] "Uh, someone I need somebody to go work
[48:13] out in the vineyard
[48:16] &gt;&gt; in the heat of the day."
[48:18] Right? Now, we know we're the 11th hour
[48:20] workers, but Jesus is looking for
[48:23] laborers who go out in the harvest and
[48:25] work
[48:27] Malachi. Is it easy or hard to go out in
[48:29] the heat of the sun at the orchard and
[48:31] harvest? Easy or hard? Hard. They come
[48:34] in, they're sweating all over the place,
[48:36] dirt all over themselves. They harvest
[48:39] pumpkins and uh give me some apples,
[48:42] peaches, what else? Pears.
[48:46] Come home and if they're not careful,
[48:47] they're burnt red. Their face is all
[48:49] burnt red. In other words, it's not a
[48:51] picnic to go work in the harvest. But
[48:54] God's eyes are watching who's going to
[48:56] go to work.
[48:58] Who's going to go to work and get on
[49:00] their knees and ask God for mercy? And
[49:02] church, if you didn't do it this
[49:03] morning, let's do it tonight. Praise
[49:04] God. Let's end the night on our knees.
[49:06] Let's end the night praying because the
[49:08] eyes, Lord, are here. He wants to see
[49:10] who can I be strong in today.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; I want to be strong for Jesus Christ.
[49:16] Let's bow our heads.
[49:19] Father God, we thank you for today. Lord
[49:21] God, I'm looking at the time.
[49:25] Lord, I didn't get to the thought I
[49:27] wanted to get to, but Lord, I just trust
[49:28] it was a good place to stop. Lord, your
[49:30] eyes were on Job that whole time. You
[49:32] saw Hallelujah. You saw every prayer for
[49:35] his children that died eventually. Lord
[49:36] God, you heard it. So, I believe you
[49:38] saved it. Saved them, Lord God, by your
[49:41] grace and mercy.
[49:44] It was part of this test of Job's
[49:47] character, God's pre-esigned test to
[49:50] test Job to the devil, to prove to the
[49:53] devil that Job really loved the Lord.
[49:58] He wasn't in it for just the benefits.
[50:00] And the Bible tells us to forget not all
[50:02] his benefits, but we're not in it for
[50:04] all those benefits, Lord God, as far as
[50:06] natural things. We're in it for the
[50:08] spiritual benefits of forgiveness
[50:11] and a promise of a mansion in heaven or
[50:14] of a promise of eternal life with Jesus
[50:16] Christ our Lord. That's why we're in it,
[50:18] Lord God.
[50:20] Hallelujah.
[50:21] [Music]
[50:24] Lord, search our hearts right now. Lord,
[50:26] I know your Bible is true. I know the
[50:28] eyes of the Lord are in this room here
[50:30] tonight.
[50:34] It's they're looking for they're looking
[50:36] to see who can I show myself strong in
[50:38] tomorrow even tonight.
[50:43] Can I show myself strong in CPPley or
[50:46] Akran or Ka Falls
[50:49] &gt;&gt; or down in Amish country? Can I show
[50:51] myself strong
[50:53] in the schools, on the job site, at the
[50:57] grocery store?
[51:00] Hallelujah. in our closets. Hallelujah.
[51:03] In our homes, in our families, in our
[51:05] public schools or our home schools, the
[51:08] Lord's eyes are looking. Who can I show
[51:10] myself strong? In other words, who can I
[51:13] help win the wrestling match? Lord God,
[51:16] we've been preaching on wrestling for
[51:17] four services in a row. Lord God,
[51:21] I trust your people are better spiritual
[51:23] wrestlers, Lord God, because of the
[51:25] preaching that we've heard.
[51:28] May they recognize tonight, Lord God,
[51:29] that when you look down, you see them in
[51:31] love, but you also test their faith. And
[51:35] you want to see them overcome. And you
[51:37] just don't look down from heaven. I'll
[51:39] say like that. Your eyes run to and fro
[51:41] on the earth, Lord God.
[51:46] Are they going to dedicate their day to
[51:47] me? Are they going to dedicate their
[51:49] words and their time and their prayer to
[51:51] me? I want to show myself strong. I want
[51:54] to do something supernatural for them.
[51:56] Oh God, look down from heaven. Have
[51:57] mercy on us here tonight. Lord God, we
[51:59] pray. Lord, forgive our sins. Lord, as
[52:02] Job said, Lord, I imagine everybody here
[52:04] would say, "I abhore when I sin. I hate
[52:06] when I sin. Oh God, I never want to sin
[52:08] against you. Why would I do it after all
[52:11] you've done for me, Lord God?"
[52:14] Yet, Lord, Paul says, "When I want to do
[52:16] good, evil's right there with me."
[52:21] Lord Jesus,
[52:23] tonight, oh God, may we rededicate our
[52:25] hearts and lives to you, Lord God. May
[52:27] we trust in you, Aresh,
[52:31] Lord, out of those five layers of
[52:33] trials, I don't know anybody here that
[52:35] might have any of them.
[52:38] So Lord, may we see our tests in a new
[52:39] light.
[52:42] As Paul said, light afflictions.
[52:44] Hallelujah. Praise God. Light
[52:46] afflictions. Oh God. Oh God. Hallelujah.
[52:52] Help us, Lord Jesus, in our light
[52:54] afflictions to believe the word of God
[52:55] to say, "The Lord gives, the Lord takes
[52:57] away. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[53:01] I'll still sacrifice in the morning.
[53:03] I'll still read my Bible. I'll still
[53:04] pray. I'll still give God glory. I'll
[53:06] still listen to music on the way to work
[53:08] or school. I'll still worship the Lord
[53:10] because I know they're not going to do
[53:11] it at school. They're not going to do it
[53:12] on the job. So, I better do it now. I
[53:14] better give God praise now while I got
[53:16] the chance.
[53:18] [Music]
[53:19] Grantite, Lord Jesus. And Lord, we know
[53:22] the enemy is going to be walking to and
[53:24] fro, too. He's going to walk through
[53:25] Akran tonight. He's going to walk
[53:26] through Ka Falls and Doylestown tonight.
[53:30] Green, Ohio. He's going to walk and look
[53:33] to try to bring people into temptation.
[53:36] Oh God, may we cast him down in Jesus
[53:39] Christ's name. Hallelujah. May we hate
[53:41] evil. May we turn down evil. May we
[53:43] depart from evil. Escue it like Job,
[53:46] Lord God. For surely we're not in the
[53:48] same situation. Surely we can be
[53:50] stronger. Surely we get good sleep. Lord
[53:52] God, surely we got money in our accounts
[53:55] and we got our children. Lord God,
[53:57] surely you bless us beyond measure. Lord
[53:59] God, help us to cast down Satan. In the
[54:02] name of Jesus Christ, I ask you, Lord
[54:04] God. May every person leave here with
[54:07] sins confessed
[54:10] and strengthened and ones that the that
[54:13] the God can use and be strong in and win
[54:17] the wrestling matches that we face
[54:19] daily. Lord God, may every person put on
[54:22] each of the parts of the garment. Lord
[54:24] God, all the armor of God, as we've been
[54:26] preaching on, Lord God, if they've set
[54:28] down their sword, may they pick it up,
[54:30] start quoting the word of God. If
[54:32] they've laid down their shield, may they
[54:34] put it up. It'll stop every mind battle.
[54:36] Hallelujah.
[54:39] It will quench every fiery trial, every
[54:43] fiery thought. Hallelujah. Every lie,
[54:46] slander, temptation. It'll quench every
[54:48] single one with faith in the word of
[54:50] God. Grant it, Lord Jesus. Thank you for
[54:53] revealing your word to us. Lord, we're
[54:55] not worthy, Lord. I'm not worthy, Lord,
[54:57] to know these things, but you gave us a
[54:59] Bible, Lord God. We thank you for that.
[55:01] Thank you that the inspiration of the
[55:03] Holy Spirit's here, Lord God, anointing
[55:05] our brother to preach on Job after the
[55:07] day after I made a video on it. Lord
[55:09] God,
[55:10] may we have a re renewed trust in God.
[55:14] That's what Job needed. He needed to
[55:15] learn how to trust God and you really
[55:17] helped him, God. May we learn to trust
[55:20] in God as well.
[55:22] May we recommmit to trusting in you no
[55:25] matter what trials you allow in your
[55:27] wisdom to come to pass in our lives. May
[55:30] we show our love to you by conducting
[55:32] ourselves with joy as brother Brandham
[55:34] said in the midst of trials, Lord God.
[55:37] Of course, many Bible verses say the
[55:39] same, Lord God.
[55:41] So Lord, we love you tonight. Lord, be
[55:43] with us as we worship. Lord, if anyone
[55:45] desire prayer, I just pray you'd hear
[55:46] their humble prayers tonight. Lord God,
[55:48] thank you for the word that we've heard
[55:50] tonight.
[55:52] Job had heard, but then he saw the Lord.
[55:55] before he saw it, he was already a
[55:59] dedicated believer, Lord God. And you
[56:02] already recognize that, Lord, is so
[56:03] powerful in heaven, the greatest man on
[56:05] earth. Oh God, thank you for the
[56:08] dedication of your people, Lord. May we
[56:10] be more dedicated. I ask it in Jesus
[56:13] Christ's
