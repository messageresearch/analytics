[5:29] tonight let's mount up Daniel chapter 8
[5:30] here by the grace of the Lord coming
[5:34] down to the end here by God's grace till
[5:37] about five more chapters okay four more
[5:42] chapters after this tonight Daniel
[5:44] chapter 8 I think 10 and 11 and 12 10 11
[5:51] are the most mysterious to me I felt
[5:53] ready chapter 18 was it as mysterious as
[5:55] I thought because it basically
[5:56] interprets the vision for us so we're
[5:59] very thankful that brother grant makes
[6:02] numerous statements at all of us don't
[6:04] understand that
[6:04] so Daniel chapter 8 I just want to read
[6:06] one verse here
[6:08] so sorry two versus Daniel 8 I want to
[6:13] read verse 2021 this will tell us who
[6:16] the RAM and the he-goat are these
[6:19] visions majesty and visions and you see
[6:22] lightning a tears and leopards and
[6:24] beasts and Rams that with all these
[6:27] things fighting it yet Daniel Saad was
[6:30] faithful to deliver the Word of God to
[6:32] to his people please now let's just read
[6:35] these verses verse 20 the RAM which I
[6:37] saw is having two arms are the kings of
[6:40] media and Persia and the rough go is the
[6:44] king of Grisha and the great horn that
[6:46] is between his eyes is the first key it
[6:50] God has blessings readings word maybe
[6:52] see the microspheres smell if I can
[6:55] switch over sir if you'd like to I told
[6:57] the last time out finished chapter 7 I
[6:59] knew there was at least a couple of
[7:00] quotes where brother have talked about
[7:03] changing laws and time so we're Daniel
[7:06] chapter 8 but we were to go back and
[7:07] just hit a couple verses in Daniel
[7:10] chapter 7 here's there's the vision that
[7:12] he sees you know he sees the go and the
[7:15] rat he sees the RAM first then he sees
[7:17] the he-goat then they fight ended up the
[7:20] goat wins which he knows that the Greeks
[7:23] you know we'll go over that just a
[7:24] moment by the grace of the Lord um but I
[7:29] told you let's finish 7:25 so you got
[7:32] your Bibles you know 7:25 there's a few
[7:35] scriptures FDA okay and I I just knew I
[7:46] just thought there was got to be a
[7:47] couple quotes oh by the way I mentioned
[7:48] verse 25 so there is I just found one
[7:52] quote I searched every word I could
[7:54] about one quote I sure that just a
[7:57] minute now if you Lydia just read
[8:00] fungicide in but Adam that's okay it's
[8:03] just about that okay you read verse 25
[8:08] sir 725 and he shall speak great words
[8:13] against the most high and shall wear out
[8:15] the Saints of the Most High and think to
[8:17] change times and laws and they shall be
[8:20] given into
[8:21] until a time and times and the dividing
[8:24] of time okay thank you
[8:26] now this is speaking of the little horn
[8:28] that rose up out of the fourth beast so
[8:32] Rome and a little horn of course you
[8:35] know would be the Antichrist the person
[8:37] the Antichrist remember he's also called
[8:39] the false prophet Revelation chapter 20
[8:41] he's got a few different names there's
[8:44] one scripture where even causing the
[8:45] Beast
[8:46] we know there's also a separate beast
[8:48] you know spirit of Rome you know we know
[8:51] that - so gotta be careful with that
[8:53] anyways I told you last time I look up
[8:55] quotations about wearing out the Saints
[8:57] and changing of laws when I looked up
[8:59] where out there were sixteen kids but
[9:00] none of them about Daniel from brother
[9:02] branham saying to the Most High there's
[9:04] one hit but it wasn't about Daniel
[9:05] changing times 60 hits without about
[9:08] Daniel times and laws there's one hit
[9:10] about Daniel's I thought one quote about
[9:14] chapter 7 verse 25 okay I just read that
[9:17] here's the quote though it's from 1962
[9:20] the influence of another he's basically
[9:24] showing the mark of the beast and
[9:26] unionised religion in this quote the
[9:29] effects of the vision upon the prophet
[9:30] oh my caused him to confess that he was
[9:32] a sinner
[9:33] anointed prophet he said I'm a man of
[9:35] unclean lips wrong I've done wrong a
[9:37] monthly myself he was a sinner unless
[9:40] speaking of Isaiah in Isaiah chapter 6
[9:41] he's confessed his sin yes sir cause the
[9:44] prophet of God the confessed that he was
[9:46] a sinner that's what the vision does
[9:48] some Dedede PhD will laugh at it
[9:51] supposed to be some hierarchy of the
[9:53] church you hear what the Cardinal said
[9:55] what the newscaster day he said there
[9:58] was some that teaches the return of the
[9:59] Lord is coming soon and he says of
[10:01] course we'll have to get rid of that
[10:02] bunch we want a new nice world religion
[10:05] just exactly so brother I've heard a car
[10:09] a Cardinal which is the Catholic
[10:11] Church's pitcher from the Catholic
[10:13] Church say they want to unionize
[10:14] religion program said just exactly said
[10:17] you people don't use all the sleep night
[10:20] that's what's happening to many people
[10:22] day to fall asleep but we're the
[10:23] children of the day time amen
[10:25] we're not going to fall asleep we're
[10:26] going to keep our eyes on the prize amen
[10:28] but man said the thing is closer than
[10:31] you think
[10:32] this spell is just about that one that
[10:34] doesn't know
[10:35] Joseph see the Rose upon Pharaoh who
[10:37] doesn't know Joseph there's a race of
[10:39] American president that don't know
[10:41] Christ we've already had a couple of
[10:42] race up there's going to want the race
[10:44] up that really don't know and watch
[10:47] coming they're just as tricky as it
[10:48] could be they got the hold right there
[10:50] the last place where they more of an
[10:53] image to it speaking of the work outs of
[10:56] churches by taking the Confederation of
[10:58] church and make it just speak just the
[11:00] same as the beasts did and give it power
[11:02] to persecute all the guys equal and will
[11:06] change the times and laws of God okay so
[11:09] there's exact quote from Daniel 7:25 so
[11:13] programs telling us that the power of
[11:16] role will raise up in the United States
[11:18] which we already knows in Revelation 13
[11:20] and it will come into the world council
[11:23] churches and that will change the times
[11:25] and laws just exactly what it says he
[11:28] said look into that later
[11:29] you said anyhow all right now remember
[11:33] do you remember how brother had said the
[11:34] temptation will come remember that I
[11:36] thought we might just read it here
[11:37] tonight in case we did remember it
[11:40] alright how to make this fullscreen okay
[11:44] there we go that's how you good I'm
[11:46] sorry it's so small
[11:47] I'm sorry I thought it'd be bigger than
[11:49] that they might know how to change that
[11:51] say about full screen mode that didn't
[11:59] work okay so about that I'll just read
[12:02] it you know I was there now grant
[12:04] Johnson how the temptation will come the
[12:07] ecumenical blue loop that is started or
[12:09] what seemed such a beautiful and blessed
[12:10] principle fulfilling Christ prayer that
[12:13] we all might see what becomes so strong
[12:15] politically that's why I said watch
[12:17] watch Trump what's these guys he's all
[12:20] buddying up with the evangelicals and
[12:22] you know that man's a sinner but married
[12:25] three times America owns he own strip
[12:27] clubs you know he's a sinner he's making
[12:30] his money off of filth
[12:31] no he's wrong I don't care how nice he
[12:34] acts to people it's just a show until he
[12:38] repents and cast on all that nonsense
[12:40] and there he's becoming all buddies with
[12:43] evangelicals you see him dying Saudi
[12:44] Arabia you know where he's going next
[12:46] the Vatican
[12:47] oh this could be l5 you be closer top
[12:51] might not be but he's making friends
[12:53] he's going to be making her to the
[12:54] Vatican and it's also going to Jerusalem
[12:56] know that go to his real mess
[12:58] watch this church this this could be it
[13:01] I don't know we never know but it's
[13:04] really striking that the u.s. is
[13:06] starting to make more close ties with
[13:09] Israel and with the Vatican that's
[13:12] really striking because that's prophecy
[13:14] amen
[13:16] it becomes so strong politically that
[13:19] she bears pressure from the government
[13:21] to cause all to join with her either
[13:23] directly or through adhere to the
[13:25] principles enacted into law see there's
[13:27] the law we just read that Daniel 5 which
[13:29] are 725 changing the laws so American
[13:33] law is going to change something with
[13:35] politics and churches so that no people
[13:39] will be recognized as actual churches
[13:41] unless under direct or indirect
[13:43] domination of this council little groups
[13:47] will lose charters well we'll just plan
[13:48] to lose it I don't even know if I have a
[13:50] charter I have to jack privileges etc
[13:54] until they lose all property we don't
[13:56] have any properties you have nothing to
[13:57] lose and spiritual rights with the
[13:59] people that's all we could lose our
[14:01] ability to minister to the people for
[14:05] example right now unless the local
[14:06] Minister associate approves at many in
[14:08] fact most cases one cannot rent a
[14:10] building for religious services weekend
[14:13] they don't check art they don't check
[14:14] our beliefs to rent this this building
[14:17] to become chaplains and the armed
[14:19] services Adam I'm talking over to the
[14:20] other day hospitals and centers almost
[14:22] now mandatory to be recognized as
[14:24] acceptable to the trinitarian ecumenical
[14:26] groups as this pressure increases and it
[14:31] will it will be harder to resist or to
[14:36] resist is to lose privilege and so many
[14:39] will be tempted to go along for they
[14:40] won't feel it's better to serve God
[14:42] publicly in the framework of this
[14:44] organization that did not serve at all
[14:46] God all publicly but they air to believe
[14:49] the devil's go levels lies to serve say
[14:51] even though you may want to call Java
[14:53] but the elect will not be to see
[14:55] a bet you see that church we have to be
[15:00] willing to lose everything just stay
[15:02] with the word don't join any fellowship
[15:04] for nothing like that
[15:06] anything that transgresses God's words
[15:08] stay away from a man I still love the
[15:10] people you know you still love them and
[15:12] still say hi to them and you'll pray for
[15:14] them and things like that but they got
[15:16] to come out of that
[15:17] furthermore the elect will not only be
[15:19] cut but as this move becomes the image
[15:21] back to the beast the Saints will be
[15:23] gone in the rapture amen
[15:25] we are going to see that blue
[15:27] politically politics of laws are going
[15:30] to change that's what the Bible just
[15:31] said he's going to change times and laws
[15:34] we've got to stay true to guys many men
[15:37] and this little delightful winds the
[15:41] movement that started out with the
[15:42] fellowship at Ephesus will become the
[15:43] monster seat that defiles and deceives
[15:45] the whole world for the church system of
[15:47] the Roman Catholic and the Protestant is
[15:49] coming together will control the whole
[15:51] wealth of the world system and force the
[15:53] whole earth into its religious tract or
[15:56] will kill them by refusing them the
[15:58] privilege of buying and selling wherever
[15:59] they would make a living
[16:01] this will be accomplished simply for the
[16:04] Harless daughters are all but gone back
[16:05] to her in the meantime the Romans
[16:07] acquired here they all the supplies of
[16:09] gold the Jews have all the bonds and all
[16:11] the paper at the right kind the harlot
[16:13] will destroy the present-day money
[16:14] system by calling in all the paper and
[16:16] demanding gold with no gold assistant
[16:20] fails the Jews will be trapped and
[16:21] coming to Lions and the auto church will
[16:23] take over the world whole world alright
[16:26] that's how the temptation is going to
[16:28] come but again it tells us that's how
[16:30] it's going to cut rubber so thankful to
[16:33] know that praise God we have to be
[16:35] willing to lose the nothing that we
[16:36] already have you don't have nothing so
[16:39] we'd have to have enough to be scared of
[16:43] all right Jeff drinks on come one vote
[16:45] that's the quote I've got ties that
[16:47] quote
[16:48] changing of times of laws into the move
[16:52] of politics and the World Council of
[16:54] Churches okay now chapter 8
[16:58] I got most of my notes from the Holden
[17:00] Study Bible which is sundowners you know
[17:02] just like Scofield in it they're really
[17:04] good stuff I took it all back to brother
[17:07] Brandon you got taking all that Chronos
[17:09] quotes and said this said chapter 8 took
[17:12] place in 550 BC two years after the
[17:15] visions of chapter 7 this is two years
[17:17] later and in the Bible in the Bible the
[17:21] Bible actually says chapter 7 was his
[17:23] first vision which is interesting I
[17:24] never thought that till reading that
[17:26] yesterday so chapter 8 is the second
[17:30] vision which is interesting the first
[17:33] vision was chapter 7 chapter 8 the
[17:35] second vision Daniels about 70 years old
[17:37] at this time see you see how this is
[17:39] Heiser this morning his service
[17:40] increases he got older amen that's why
[17:43] would my prayer be out yet let my
[17:46] service to Christ increases I get older
[17:48] amen let me do more for Jesus all right
[17:51] so chapter what sorry chapter 8
[17:54] apartment verse 1 it says in the third
[17:58] year of the reign of King Belshazzar
[17:59] vision appeared unto me even though to
[18:01] me Daniel after which appeared unto me
[18:04] at the first chapter 7 was his first
[18:07] vision chapter 8 was the second vision
[18:11] all right now
[18:13] Lydia chapter 2 verse 2 daughters when I
[18:21] started I was at Shushan in the palace
[18:23] which is in the province along and I saw
[18:28] in a vision and I would by the river
[18:30] thank you so Daniel was in Shushan now
[18:34] it's called also called Susa by the
[18:36] river you lie it's about 200 miles
[18:40] northeast of Babylon which is modern-day
[18:42] Iran so here's where Babylon was and
[18:45] Daniels really hope she's right here in
[18:47] xuxa day Iran there Jerusalem you know
[18:50] he's quite a ways holy they just to kind
[18:54] of give you an idea where he's at
[18:55] by the grace Lord modern day Iran now
[19:00] brother had agreed for me sir you read
[19:02] verses out three four five please then I
[19:06] lifted up my eyes and so lo and behold
[19:08] there's Fez before
[19:10] the river a ram we had two horns and two
[19:13] horns were I the one was higher than the
[19:17] other and a higher came up laughs I saw
[19:20] the left
[19:21] I saw the Rams fishing westward and
[19:23] northward and southward so that no beast
[19:27] may stand before him neither was there
[19:30] any that could deliver out of his hand
[19:33] but he did according to his well and
[19:37] became great and as I was considering
[19:40] behold and he goat came from the West on
[19:44] the face of the whole earth and touched
[19:46] not the ground and the goat had a noble
[19:51] Horn dies hey that thank you sir
[19:54] appreciate that
[19:55] okay so here's he's here and sees this
[19:59] vision we just talked about now in
[20:01] verses 3 & 5 oh that I've just read it
[20:02] the RAM with the two horns is
[20:04] interpreted verse 20 it's called the
[20:07] medo-persian empire the ego or rough
[20:11] goat it's called the rough goat and rich
[20:13] 21 was the king of grisha or the ancient
[20:17] Greeks the great horn was the first king
[20:20] which the first king of the ancient
[20:21] Greeks was Alexander the Great
[20:23] alright so here's the picture again the
[20:27] he-goat
[20:27] he was all the ramp first Rams actually
[20:30] first the he goes second so we have the
[20:32] medo-persians
[20:34] and then we have the the Greece which
[20:37] which Daniel's already seen visions of
[20:39] these this just gives him more
[20:41] information about it all right so let me
[20:46] uh
[20:46] remember the he-goat was the Greek okay
[20:49] RAM and go remember this Ram goat so
[20:56] they're given two different animals
[20:57] right the Medes and Persians is called a
[20:59] ram and a bear it's also called a
[21:02] leopard indigo which is interesting God
[21:04] just does that no that's what was
[21:06] happening so Danny would already see
[21:09] that chapter 2 he'd seen this in Chapter
[21:11] 7 and then in chapter 8 he sees the
[21:15] Medes of Persians as we said it has a
[21:18] ram and then he sees the ancient Greeks
[21:20] as a goat
[21:23] it's a little bit you know a bit
[21:24] confusing but that's what the Bible says
[21:26] so again we have Daniel Chu he sees this
[21:29] 70 sees this that was revelation 13
[21:32] member they're all combined into one
[21:34] beast there in Revelation is it's all
[21:36] the Deen all the demons that were these
[21:38] powers are now in the in Rome right now
[21:40] alright that makes sense by God's grace
[21:43] oh that's okay if you're one of these
[21:45] notes I can just send you the email you
[21:47] know to help you out we're going to go
[21:49] over it study it so verses 5 to 8 mm
[21:53] read 5 how am i doing on time alright
[22:00] creaking I want to get through this in
[22:01] about hours I think I'll be able to do
[22:02] this remember of verse 5 to go or the
[22:05] Greeks move so fast that it did not cut
[22:09] up to growl which is a reference to the
[22:11] Swift speedy clock conquest of the
[22:13] entire Near East in only three years and
[22:16] you can lift this up in any encyclopedic
[22:17] I looked it up in the Botanica it's true
[22:19] the Greeks took over the world in three
[22:21] years so the Bible called that moving
[22:25] with no feet just flying and that's a
[22:27] fast army to three years to take over
[22:29] the whole world basically and the Greek
[22:33] Empire to feed the mesial needle
[22:35] persians in 331 BC that was in verse 7
[22:39] so let's reverse 7 this is where of
[22:41] course the goat defeats the RAM in other
[22:46] words this isn't how I was into the
[22:47] green verse 7 and I saw him come closer
[22:49] to the Ravan II was Lou with collar
[22:51] against him and smoke the ram and break
[22:54] his two horns and there was no cloud on
[22:56] the RAM to stand before him but he cast
[22:58] him down to the ground and stamped upon
[23:00] it there was none that could deliver the
[23:02] ran out of his hand
[23:05] now look at verse 8 therefore then the
[23:10] he-goat wax very great and when he was
[23:12] strong the great horn was broken and
[23:15] four heads came up four notable ones
[23:18] toward the winds of heaven
[23:21] all right so in verse eight at the
[23:23] height of the goats power ooh this goat
[23:25] the Greeks just conquered the Medes and
[23:27] Persians right at the height of the
[23:29] goats power the great horn was broken
[23:32] which is a reference to Alexander's
[23:34] sudden death at
[23:35] peak of hardening peach peach honey
[23:39] thinks that that's embarrassing at the
[23:41] peak of his greatness hurt me look peach
[23:47] I don't even have any peach yesterday
[23:49] nor that going for barmy whoops
[23:52] at the beaches great Oh
[23:56] 323 BC so he conquered them and look
[24:00] just 88 years later eight years later he
[24:02] dies and you know why he died because he
[24:05] had nothing left to conquer he thought
[24:08] he had arrived and so he got drunk and
[24:10] died from an alcoholic overdose see how
[24:13] we always need to battle the fight
[24:14] Church and see how we always need
[24:16] something to do and work for the Lord
[24:18] always got something to do something it
[24:20] better something to prove
[24:21] you know stuff to do for God amen that's
[24:24] what program tells leave this program
[24:26] tells us I thought about Christ Christ
[24:27] is the body buddy conquer here is the
[24:30] one Christ who conquered both worlds of
[24:32] the scene unseen not like Alexander who
[24:35] conquer the world age of 33 I knew no
[24:37] other way to turn for further conquest
[24:39] so he died a victim of sin righteously
[24:43] goodness Greer's you know he took over
[24:46] the whole world he waited a few days
[24:48] just kind of getting drunk drunk drunk
[24:50] i'm dinah dinah down the hall at the age
[24:52] of 33 and christ died as god's sacrifice
[24:55] at the age of 33 both were conquerors
[24:58] but only one died in the faith they may
[25:00] men Christ was the mighty Conqueror how
[25:03] did he go
[25:04] it is interesting he both died at 33
[25:06] having conquered everything but see how
[25:08] example was only natural contouring not
[25:10] spiritual even a Christ was spiritually
[25:14] met now in verse 8 the four notable ones
[25:18] if you go back in history you can search
[25:19] us out of the reddit last night if you
[25:21] want look it up the four notable ones
[25:24] were actually when Alexander's Kingdom
[25:26] was divided by four of his generals this
[25:29] is all historic Cassandra over Macedon
[25:33] and Greece by side matches over Grace
[25:38] and Asia Minor
[25:40] Celie yuccas over Syria Babylon and
[25:43] commlink over Egypt and that's
[25:46] historical you can find that in the you
[25:48] look up
[25:49] ancient Greek you'll find that in the
[25:51] Britannica now in verses 9 to 12 a
[25:56] little horn emerges from this he go the
[26:00] ancient Greeks so after Alexander the
[26:04] Great dies there comes up another great
[26:06] ruler but he's a little horn which
[26:08] historians believe was in Antiochus the
[26:12] 4th ruler of the cell uses dynasty
[26:16] dynasty who conquered southern and
[26:19] eastern lands and also the pleasant land
[26:21] in verse 9 it says he hid conquered the
[26:24] pleasant land of Israel he brutally
[26:27] stabbed upon the Jewish people from 170
[26:30] to 164 BC it was one of the most brutal
[26:33] persecution of Jews and a halt but it
[26:36] lasted six years it was said Antiochus
[26:42] blasphemously presented himself as the
[26:44] Prince of the host or God himself
[26:47] stopping the daily sacrifice and
[26:49] defining the temple jerusalem in 167 BC
[26:52] now this is absolutely historical
[26:55] because every year which is this is kind
[26:57] of funny every year for Hanukkah
[27:00] December I show the Hanukah video to my
[27:03] class because I have to teach all the
[27:05] religions of a summer so I show a video
[27:08] about Christmas and Hanukkah all these
[27:11] other ponds you know different things
[27:13] like that
[27:14] and every year I show the Hanukkah video
[27:16] and Antiochus is on every there's on
[27:20] that video every year this is all
[27:22] historical it's purely historical so my
[27:24] first graders the last ten years have
[27:26] been learning about antique it's now
[27:27] they probably forgot it right away at
[27:29] least they got to see it so the he's the
[27:33] little that rose up at the ancient
[27:35] Greeks he's a little horn the first King
[27:38] died right away without him to drink but
[27:40] one of the little arms rose up Antiochus
[27:43] now verses 9 to 12 officer I want to
[27:48] make this I want to make this point the
[27:50] little horn of this chapter chapter 8
[27:52] which was Antiochus the fourth must not
[27:55] be confused with a little Horn of
[27:56] chapter seven verse eight because the
[27:59] little Horn of chapter seven was from
[28:01] the fourth beast
[28:02] the little horn were talking about right
[28:04] now is from the third Beast
[28:05] okay so they're both called little horns
[28:07] you gotta watch that description we
[28:09] leave a little horn is the future Pope
[28:11] that will become the person headed
[28:13] Christ so the little horn of chapter 7
[28:15] is the Pope Antichrist the little part
[28:17] of chapter 8 is Antiochus because it's
[28:21] from the 3rd Empire not the fourth the
[28:23] fourth is roll third was Greeks
[28:25] so this want to lay that in there so you
[28:28] don't confuse it like I said to sell out
[28:29] to study but we got to study history
[28:31] praise God now verses 13 to 14 let's
[28:36] read those would someone like to read my
[28:37] columns gracious if anyone else like to
[28:38] read came out kind I don't impress you
[28:41] so she goes huh
[28:42] you have to realize them one time you
[28:44] read it so you don't know don't feel
[28:46] like you have to now guys you wanted
[28:48] okay
[28:49] 13 or 14 Daniel 8 13 good buddy then I
[28:56] heard once Saint speaking and another
[28:57] say sinks that certain sangwich space
[29:00] which spake
[29:01] how long have them feed how long shall
[29:04] be the vision concerning the daily
[29:06] sacrifice in the transgression of
[29:08] desolation to give both the sanctuary
[29:10] and the host be trodden under foot and
[29:13] you send to me unto 2300 days then shall
[29:16] the sanctuary be cleansed all right so
[29:20] just to just teach little more on that
[29:23] Antiochus was called that little horn
[29:25] and in the vision it told Daniel this
[29:28] little horn is going to rain for 2300
[29:31] days and that's historical as well so
[29:35] Antiochus the file he defiled the Temple
[29:38] of Jerusalem he defiled God's temple and
[29:41] he took the daily sacrifice away for
[29:43] that many days until the temple was
[29:46] rededicated by Judas Maccabee and he was
[29:50] on the video I showed that you're lucky
[29:52] I haven't on my school computer I can
[29:53] show it to you guys sometime if you like
[29:55] and this happened in 164 BC this event
[30:00] is still celebrated by Jewish people
[30:02] today during the feast of Hanukkah which
[30:05] is called the feast of light let me know
[30:06] that God's grace so if you remember that
[30:11] story and Tiye kiss you know was ruling
[30:14] he
[30:15] persecution of the Jews he took over the
[30:16] temple in Israel but Judah Maccabee had
[30:20] no roof I was like we got to get the
[30:22] temple back and so he did he led like it
[30:25] is called like guerrilla warfare that's
[30:26] with a britannica called it he raised up
[30:29] an army and they defeated the Greeks and
[30:32] they took back the temple they tore down
[30:33] the history says they went to the temple
[30:36] after they defeated the Greek army and
[30:38] they were crying because there was idols
[30:39] in the temple and then to purge it out
[30:41] and you know the story they dedicated
[30:44] the temple shortly after that after
[30:46] cleaning it up
[30:47] but they're running out of oil for the
[30:49] dedication but they prayed and God that
[30:52] the oil lasts for seven days it is a
[30:53] miracle and that's the miracle of
[30:56] Hanukkah do you remember that by God's
[30:58] grace you learn at school that's it's a
[31:00] it's a it's a well no miracle of people
[31:03] deny it but they know it's true Jews
[31:05] know it's true amen
[31:06] and Jesus celebrated the feast of
[31:08] Hanukkah if you want to go to John
[31:10] chapter 10 you know that let's go to
[31:12] John chapter 10 so how'd it go something
[31:14] that Jesus vindicated Jesus went to the
[31:16] temple and he taught on Solomon's porch
[31:18] on the feast of Hanukkah Daniel 10 22 23
[31:27] I'm sorry not Daniel 10 worst enemy
[31:30] John 10 John 10:22 forgiveness and it
[31:36] was at Jerusalem the Feast of the
[31:37] dedication and it was winter see because
[31:40] they celebrated in December and Jesus
[31:44] walked through the temple in Solomon's
[31:46] porch and he began teaching and they
[31:48] they said how long does I'll make us
[31:51] doubt if that would be the Christ tell
[31:52] us plainly Jesus said I told you already
[31:54] you believe me not he had already told
[31:57] if he said I and my father are one he
[32:01] said those bailey's that I already told
[32:02] you even he said but the works that I do
[32:04] prove that the Son of God so see if
[32:08] there is a Hanukkah he's preaching to
[32:10] other people I am got some internet so
[32:13] Jesus recognized this end of the 2300
[32:18] days Jesus recognized it by celebrating
[32:21] the feast of dedication it was Hanukkah
[32:25] so Judah Maccabee the star
[32:28] - he defeated those Greek soldiers and
[32:31] he rededicated the temple and it's
[32:33] called the feast of Hanukkah today that
[32:36] was the end of the 2300 days all right
[32:41] let's go to verses 15 and 17 I'm getting
[32:43] warm your partner Lydia would you read
[32:46] 15 16 and 17
[32:58] [Music]
[33:01] I heard a man's voice - thanks lie which
[33:05] is we just called it
[33:07] Gabriel make the audience understand
[33:09] division he 72,000 here we're expert in
[33:13] one he can lie with His grace and fell
[33:16] upon my face and he said it but he said
[33:18] unto me understand us on us in grateful
[33:21] family and should be all right thank you
[33:24] now here's I get to understand this next
[33:26] part I had to lay this in here Gabriel's
[33:29] commanded to make Daniel understand the
[33:30] vision see how angels play an important
[33:33] part in the lives of prophets we're
[33:35] listening to programs life story by open
[33:37] jorgensen and the angels are starting to
[33:40] get more involved in brother branham's
[33:41] life it's beautiful to hear that because
[33:42] it's just like the Bible the angel
[33:46] remember the angels or you Daniel the
[33:48] angels or the Moses the angel God is
[33:50] always with the prophet of God
[33:53] remember that bro did you know applaud a
[33:55] ninja brother and do you know that okay
[33:58] I'm going to read that real quick that'd
[34:00] be okay all right I just wanna make sure
[34:02] he gets that by God's grace let's go to
[34:04] the book of Acts and I'll look it up
[34:11] here
[34:16] yeah there's a 27:23 so Paul's in the
[34:20] ship and they're all going they're all
[34:21] scared with all these prisoners you want
[34:22] the prisoners and they all think they're
[34:23] going to die y'all think they're going
[34:25] to sink
[34:25] Paul had a meeting with his angel that
[34:27] night yeah romance at the bottom of the
[34:29] boat he was praying a Amy came to visit
[34:32] and he come up on the top of the boat he
[34:34] said fear that he said stay in the ship
[34:36] and you're gonna live
[34:37] now here's what he said where there's
[34:40] good me but I need this night the angel
[34:42] God who's I am and whom I serve amen
[34:46] amen
[34:47] see every prophet of God has an angel to
[34:49] them all right New Testament actually
[34:53] right that's exactly right
[34:55] praise the Lord so I just want to show
[34:57] you that by God's grace I don't know how
[34:59] to do that I want to lay that in there
[35:00] they'll be very helpful to him to know
[35:02] that now
[35:06] Gabriel told Daniel the vision was for
[35:08] the time of the end
[35:10] now this meaning meaning this vision of
[35:14] the little horn and tifos had a compound
[35:16] prophecy the temple was rededicated in
[35:20] 164 BC or about 386 years after this
[35:24] vision and so 164 BC was not the time of
[35:28] the end or end of days but just the end
[35:31] of this vision here on the end of the
[35:33] 2300 days now here's where brother
[35:38] Branham quotes will start coming in
[35:40] Antiochus was a tight or free figure of
[35:43] the end time Antichrist that's why
[35:47] Daniel 8 is important to us the Pope who
[35:50] will exalt himself above all the telegin
[35:52] in the temple of God so until his did
[35:56] the same thing he called himself God at
[35:59] the temple of God and history and both
[36:03] history and brother brand recognized
[36:05] Antiochus as a pre figure of the
[36:07] Antichrist the hope that's why this
[36:10] chapter is important to us especially
[36:13] important so when the Abril says this
[36:15] into the time of the end
[36:16] he means the time of the end of
[36:18] Antiochus but also the time of the end
[36:21] to the tribulation when the Anti Christ
[36:23] upon the earth so it's a compound
[36:25] prophecy can we see that
[36:27] hope you can see that by God's grace now
[36:31] verses 18 to 22 all right brother
[36:37] madame curie 18 to 19 better now as he
[36:41] was speaking with me i was a deep sleep
[36:44] on my face
[36:45] towards the ground but he touched me and
[36:47] set me an upright and
[36:50] he said if old I will make thee know
[36:53] what shall be in the last and last end
[36:57] of the indignation for at the time
[37:00] appointed the end of jumpy thank you
[37:02] every 23 one this was our text the RAM
[37:05] which sour sauce having the two R's are
[37:07] the kings of media Persia and the rough
[37:11] goat is the king of Grisha and the Green
[37:12] Hornet's between his eyes is the first
[37:14] king
[37:14] I was Alexander the Great verse 22 now
[37:16] that thing broken what the goat I'm
[37:20] sorry now more now examine the great now
[37:22] that being broken
[37:23] whereas for stood up for it number the
[37:26] four generals bored kingdoms are
[37:28] standing up out of its on the nation but
[37:30] not in his power there's what we get the
[37:34] end of the vision of the RAM and ego
[37:35] would be at the time appointed by the
[37:38] 2300 days the RAM or Medes ruled from
[37:42] 539 to 331 BC if I pull those up right
[37:46] out of pretending while the he drove he
[37:49] go he goat sorry goat Greece ruled from
[37:53] 321 that's the year that all tentative
[37:55] started concrete that's when he
[37:57] conquered the means to 27 BC so Greek
[38:01] ruled a little while there and that was
[38:05] when ancient Rome became an official
[38:06] Empire you read about rough or Rome or
[38:08] Babylon which I wrote Rome started
[38:11] around 500 BC but it didn't become an
[38:13] empire until 27 BC history says that as
[38:17] well so this falls on a perfect order
[38:19] with Daniels vision from Daniel chapter
[38:21] 2 for Kingdom stood up out of the nation
[38:25] and those were the four kings who took
[38:27] report generals who took over after
[38:28] Alexander but did not rule in
[38:31] Alexander's power right because they
[38:33] weren't Alexander they ruled in their
[38:35] own power
[38:36] okay now verse 23 and 24 next button
[38:41] can you read verse 23 method and a lot
[38:45] of times their Kingdom when the
[38:47] transgressors are come to the full
[38:49] aquinnah fierce countenance that I
[38:51] understand dark sentences shall stand up
[38:54] all right now
[38:55] gable mentions notice their king of
[38:57] that's the Greek the Greeks will have a
[39:00] king of fierce countenance which was
[39:02] believed to be a further
[39:03] description of Antiochus the fourth
[39:06] member there kena now verse 24 lady kiri
[39:10] 24 now and his power shall be mine even
[39:14] that lady's own power
[39:15] these are the strong wonderfully and
[39:17] shall prosper in carcass and shall
[39:19] destroy the mighty okay my mother still
[39:22] talking about the Greeks still talking
[39:23] about the Greeks so he's telling more
[39:25] about Antiochus Antiochus his power
[39:27] would not be his own but rather from
[39:30] Satan he killed many mighty I'm sorry he
[39:35] killed many mighty and holy people
[39:36] there's another typo let me fix it like
[39:39] anybody wants this by an email result
[39:42] like that has to make sense okay good
[39:45] which were the Jews the Jews were the
[39:47] holy and mighty people all right now
[39:51] verse 25 is here's where we're getting
[39:52] into brother and his quote he just said
[39:54] I think we did have two quotes on this
[39:57] but happy 325 for me say thank you very
[40:00] and though this policy also he shall
[40:03] cause craft to prosper in his hand any
[40:07] show magnify himself in his heart and
[40:10] five peace shall destroy many he shall
[40:14] also stand up against the Prince of
[40:16] princes princes but he shall be broken
[40:20] without hand hey thank you sir now this
[40:25] is course speaking of Antiochus and he
[40:27] just did all these things but just as
[40:30] Antiochus did I misspelled his name to
[40:33] my goodness the future Pope Antichrist
[40:38] will have policy or politics right laws
[40:43] - chief - cause craft to prosper which
[40:47] Lorraine says is manufactured so people
[40:50] say oh we're going to go into depression
[40:51] well the Bible makes it sound like
[40:53] crafts gonna prosper it's the age of
[40:56] laodicean I'm not saying you know
[40:57] there's little receptions here and there
[40:58] right you know but this is the age of
[41:01] having rich increase with goods but
[41:02] having needed nothing having no no more
[41:04] need of God and the boat will magnify
[41:09] itself in his heart by peace you will
[41:11] destroy penny and will stand up against
[41:13] the Prince of princes Jesus Christ but
[41:16] we broke
[41:17] without hand a brother grandma also
[41:20] believed this compound prophecy of
[41:21] Antiochus and the future Pope Antichrist
[41:25] let's read that I know it's kind of the
[41:28] church I know a little bit deep but I
[41:30] said if you want the quotes you can go
[41:32] back over them again or study it I know
[41:35] it's a little bit deep here's the quote
[41:38] why am I getting organized religion
[41:41] don't watch all these gimmick workers
[41:44] but remember they're only speaking a
[41:47] bogus dollar holy speaks than a real one
[41:49] somewhere when you see this organization
[41:52] stuff growing and prospering as it said
[41:54] crafts would prosper in his hand just
[42:00] remember there's a little Church of God
[42:02] somewhere really is Holy Ghost filled
[42:05] genuine that's moving up the ladder
[42:07] don't look at the big organization
[42:10] there's two quotes on prospering with
[42:13] crafts this is the first one so Manson
[42:16] never look at a big organization but a
[42:18] lot much state transfer no matter how
[42:20] much money they have and whatever more
[42:22] be that little group that loves the Holy
[42:24] Ghost a man though don't be attracted by
[42:27] big groups and big money you don't like
[42:29] that stay with the word amen now the
[42:32] second time he quotes it is in the first
[42:34] seal about crafts and prospering now
[42:39] Antiochus did the same thing that the
[42:41] future Antichrist will do he prospered
[42:43] through a craft and peace he brought
[42:47] false peace and he brought a false
[42:49] crap also wealth here through
[42:52] manufacturing here's a program said
[42:57] after the churches taken away here and
[43:00] then about that earlier in the rapture
[43:01] Roman the Jews will make a covenant with
[43:03] one another the Bible said they would
[43:06] with the holy people and now notice
[43:09] they'll make it because why the nation
[43:11] is going to be busted and we already are
[43:15] what's the debt now anybody with the
[43:17] debt set enough last time I looked it
[43:19] was like eighteen trillion what's that
[43:21] now same window 22 well and they all
[43:26] they all condemned each other for the
[43:27] debt and nobody does anything about it
[43:30] that's called I don't know what that's
[43:31] called insanity he has not attended this
[43:34] nation is going to be busted and the
[43:37] rest of the world that's on the gold
[43:38] standard is busted you know you know
[43:40] that if we're living off of taxes due
[43:42] bills forty years from now where are we
[43:45] at there's only one thing could happen
[43:46] that's to call the currency if they off
[43:49] the bottles and we can't do it Wall
[43:52] Street owns that Wall Street is
[43:53] controlled by the Jews the rest of us in
[43:55] the Vatican and the Jews has got the
[43:57] rest of it in Wall Street with the
[43:58] Commerce of the world he said like this
[44:01] fella down here what's the Dave Castro
[44:03] hit he done the only smart thing ever
[44:06] did do then he destroyed the bonds paid
[44:08] them off and destroyed that notice but
[44:11] we can't do that these guys won't let us
[44:13] the rich merchants of the earth hold it
[44:16] and there's only one thing to do the
[44:17] Catholic Church can pay it off which is
[44:19] our nation's thins talking about she's
[44:22] the only one that's got the money she
[44:23] can do it and she will do it sometimes
[44:26] houses she will do it and in doing this
[44:29] to get it she'll compromise with the
[44:32] Jews and make it covenant and when she
[44:36] makes his coming with the Jews now
[44:37] remember I'm taking this from the
[44:39] scriptures and now when she does this
[44:41] and makes this covenant we noticed in
[44:43] Daniel 8 23 and 25 he will cause craft
[44:48] to prosper and craft is manufacturing so
[44:53] see there has to be some connection
[44:55] between the economy and the Vatican and
[44:58] the Jews because the Bible said they'll
[45:01] make crafts to prosper and remember in
[45:04] Revelation 18 when all the princes are
[45:07] crying because the Vatican's being
[45:08] destroyed their cries because there they
[45:10] had all this connection economically to
[45:12] the Vatican so I don't understand it the
[45:14] closest thing I've ever heard
[45:15] understanding it is that a lot of
[45:17] Catholics own major companies and
[45:20] corporations that's the only thing I can
[45:22] that's the closest I can get you know
[45:23] outside of conspiracy theories you know
[45:26] what's up there's so many of those you
[45:29] know it's hard to know but I can see
[45:31] something I can prove and if I can't
[45:32] prove it I don't really see much about
[45:33] it but the Bible said there's some
[45:36] connection between the Roman Catholic
[45:38] Church and the economy so I don't know
[45:42] just be like
[45:42] be the most logical thing you know like
[45:44] program setting you know controlling the
[45:46] Wall Street and the money and the big
[45:48] companies it must be that way I'm not
[45:50] quite sure alright so he quoted Daniel
[45:54] 8:23 through 25 so see brother grab this
[45:58] is about Antiochus by history but it's
[46:01] also a compound prophecy because number
[46:04] Antiochus was in the temple claiming
[46:06] that he was God
[46:07] that's what 2nd Thessalonians chapter 2
[46:09] says that the emmett price will sit the
[46:11] temple of God claiming that he is God
[46:14] that's exactly right so what that
[46:17] recognizes this can we see that now he
[46:21] goes on program goes on and he makes
[46:23] this coming with the Jews in the midst
[46:25] of this three half years he breaks his
[46:27] covenant as soon as he gets the thing
[46:29] wrapped up and takes get the money of
[46:31] the Jews tied up and when he does that
[46:34] oh my oh my he's he's called the
[46:36] Antichrist to the other church age for
[46:38] he is and he had assured our against
[46:40] Christ and the word this is called the
[46:43] Antichrist now he's going to hold the
[46:45] money and that's where I think he'll
[46:47] come in his programs thought he never
[46:49] gave us the Upstate Lord he said that's
[46:51] where I think they'll come in and he
[46:52] gave scripture for so that's the best I
[46:55] can do with teaching on that now can I
[46:58] just share something here real quick the
[47:01] Bible said he breaks the coveted the
[47:02] heads of the three and a half years and
[47:04] here's what I believe and I hope you
[47:07] understand this I believe the Pope and
[47:09] the Jews will make a covenant for seven
[47:11] years but in the middle of it they'll
[47:14] break it and that's because that's the
[47:17] end of the three to half years of the
[47:19] Daniel seventy weeks there's only three
[47:21] half years left how do you know that 69
[47:24] - the years have already been fulfilled
[47:25] Jesus that's 16 out of the weeks I'm
[47:28] sorry the 70th week is seven years but
[47:31] Jesus are you priest read half of that 7
[47:33] and the Jews come so the Jews will have
[47:36] two prophets priests for how long three
[47:38] and a half years to finish that last
[47:41] half of the last week so that's the way
[47:44] I can understand my scripture that will
[47:46] make after the rapture
[47:47] they'll make a peace covenant for seven
[47:49] years but it'll be broken in the midst
[47:51] of the week but that's right at the end
[47:54] of the last three - half years and
[47:55] that's
[47:56] Jesus comes back and he reveals himself
[47:58] to the Jews and 144,000 are sealed with
[48:02] the father's seal in their Nativity net
[48:04] which is the faxes with the Holy Ghost
[48:06] amen
[48:06] and then the Bible says that the Beast
[48:09] will go to make war against Israel and
[48:12] not see they have a cover for three deaf
[48:14] ears at last three deaf ears but then
[48:16] they come against the fight against
[48:17] Israel see the reason I share that
[48:21] because some people say well the
[48:22] tribulation seven years tribulation
[48:24] three half years all we know by
[48:26] scripture is that after the rapture
[48:28] there's three and half years to the Jews
[48:29] that's what we know why scripture
[48:31] because he had he cuts off the Gentiles
[48:34] raptures the Gentiles and then he grabs
[48:36] back at the Jews for 394 years right and
[48:39] then after that times up for the Jews
[48:41] under 44,000 get sealed and then comes
[48:44] the Battle of Armageddon and comes all
[48:46] these trumpets and vials and all these
[48:47] things at the end and its destruction
[48:49] time and it's time for fire to come down
[48:52] and then it's millenium time don't worry
[48:55] God it's his seventh day he gives a
[48:58] thousand years for this life they met
[49:00] Gloria I'm almost out here let me see
[49:05] [Music]
[49:09] Ray's a little an evening but it's the
[49:13] lord help us okay how's listening to the
[49:17] church ages and Bob Graham says never
[49:19] begin the church is lord help us be
[49:21] ready to stand now because the time is
[49:22] closing in as we see this to our beast
[49:25] rise up out of the earth not how the
[49:27] thickness of vultures of people with
[49:30] horns like a lamb but a steak like a
[49:32] dragon never he's talking about
[49:33] Revelation 13 the Beast in the United
[49:36] States we believe that our is close at
[49:39] hand now father when these churches is
[49:41] Confederated themselves together make it
[49:43] an image into the Beast and it will be
[49:45] terrible on that group Lord that won't
[49:47] join them the very boycott will come but
[49:51] in that hour you promised to take your
[49:53] church you said help us Lord
[49:55] I just want to again show you that's
[49:58] another word for the squeeze it's gonna
[49:59] be kind of kind of like a boycott
[50:01] romance with a boycott of scriptural
[50:03] there's another Court I have on that so
[50:06] see we're coming down to that he's going
[50:08] to change times and laws
[50:09] was going to prosper in his hand this
[50:11] guy is going to be saying he's Superman
[50:12] the Antichrist the Pope
[50:15] alright last few okay so go to verses 26
[50:19] to 27
[50:20] let's finish the chapter here I'm
[50:24] looking forward to chapter 9 because
[50:25] I've already preached Daniel 70 weeks I
[50:27] just kind of got a fresh jump on verses
[50:30] up one to nineteen maybe four more by
[50:34] the next week
[50:35] balcony Reapers 26 Lydia your choice in
[50:41] elevation of the evening and the morning
[50:44] which was told is true or for shuttle up
[50:48] division for a chubby for many days amen
[51:02] freeze done okay so see what the other
[51:05] shows us the effects of visions upon
[51:08] prophets I have a quote I don't have it
[51:10] ready on the slideshow but I have over
[51:12] brother Branham said when Jesus said the
[51:15] greater works shall these do then I've
[51:18] done brother Branham said because jesus
[51:20] said that he said I'd be able to have
[51:22] more visions than Daniel and all those
[51:25] he said because one vision would sit him
[51:28] down for how many days he faint one
[51:30] vision and brother may have visions all
[51:33] the time right but he wasn't painting
[51:36] all the time because Jesus said you'll
[51:38] do greater than those works
[51:40] does that help by God's grace one vision
[51:43] knocked him out for days your brother
[51:45] and you see vision after vision he could
[51:46] do seven in a row 10 the row on the
[51:48] prayer lines and knock knock him out he
[51:49] just get tired because he had a greater
[51:51] power seat because the blood of Jesus
[51:53] Christ is there hallelujah amen the
[51:56] price of FA the power only goes to come
[51:59] the blood of Christ brought more power
[52:01] David so we see Gabriel instructed
[52:06] Daniel to shut down up the vision for it
[52:08] shall be for many days the days of NTIA
[52:12] is for almost 400 years away so the
[52:14] vision had to be shut out for about four
[52:15] more years for that part of the vision
[52:17] but the days of the Pope Antichrist
[52:20] we're about 2500 years away
[52:22] and still counting right because we're
[52:25] still counting the days now that is my
[52:27] last slide let's say my figure like I
[52:29] was mrs. Hannah now my Bible this is my
[52:32] Holmen Bible brought out all these
[52:36] similarities between Antiochus and the
[52:40] Pope the Pope Antichrist let's see
[52:42] there's three four five six seven eight
[52:44] nine ten eleven children that's striking
[52:46] in that striking in this one chapter
[52:48] there's twelve similarities between the
[52:51] Pope and Christ and Antiochus my brother
[52:54] Graham said that's what the that's what
[52:56] that chapter was about I just read you
[52:58] that quote he said the Pope will try to
[53:01] cause craft to prosper thank God for a
[53:05] prophet in the salary so see Antiochus
[53:07] and Antichrist are symbolized by horns
[53:11] that were little at the beginning his
[53:12] number a little horn coming out of the
[53:14] fourth Empire they're both called little
[53:16] arm that's one similarity number two
[53:19] and Jesus looked fierce and Antichrist
[53:21] will have an opposing look yep it's in
[53:23] me ready but we got that Daniel 7:20 I'm
[53:25] I read that again just because I forgot
[53:27] oh yeah right he says even that war that
[53:31] had eyes and a mouth to speak very great
[53:34] things whose look was more stout than
[53:36] his fellow the Antichrist is going to be
[53:38] on posi looking person he's give me a
[53:41] Posey looking Pope that's why I don't
[53:43] think is this one you don't look very
[53:44] imposing I don't mean but it could be I
[53:47] don't know we don't know how much time
[53:48] you have
[53:49] I was said they cast out look Antiochus
[53:54] was a master of entry the brilliance of
[53:58] Antichrist is suggested by the eyes of
[54:00] the horn yeah the boat that both horns
[54:04] have eyes remember both have I have this
[54:06] intrigue about them this mysterious of
[54:08] their ability to deceive that's right
[54:12] Antiochus has great power the Antichrist
[54:15] will have even greater power that's
[54:18] right second Thessalonians 2:9 and in
[54:21] Revelation 13:7 a yep that's exactly
[54:23] right
[54:23] the number gasps yes hard to make a war
[54:25] against the Jews that's right if you
[54:27] don't know that that's a revelation of
[54:29] thirteen seventeen eighty the Antichrist
[54:31] will break the covenant and then fight
[54:32] against the Jews that's exactly right
[54:35] next what
[54:36] and Jesus was energized by Satan just as
[54:39] the Antichrist will be empowered by
[54:41] Satan praise God
[54:43] let me read 2nd Thessalonians 2 real
[54:46] quick
[54:47] I'm almost under now what I'd be great
[54:50] thing there in it previous rest you
[54:52] think that's till chapter 2 verse 9 is 8
[54:56] members dr. Smith okay even him whose
[55:01] coming is after the working of Satan
[55:03] with all power and signs and lying
[55:07] wonders amen so they're after the
[55:09] working of Satan so Satan's working
[55:11] through the Antichrist that's what he's
[55:13] doing
[55:15] Antiochus destroyed thousands the
[55:19] Antichrist will destroy more that's
[55:22] right yeah yeah that's in the get some
[55:26] sermons right on that by God's grace and
[55:28] I have almost servants for the whole
[55:30] book of Revelation very Antigua's
[55:34] prospered for a short time likewise the
[55:36] Antichrist for a short time Amen or last
[55:39] very long and he is first you the Jews
[55:42] as will the Antichrist the Pope will
[55:45] persecute the Jews
[55:47] yep Revelation chapter 12 that's right
[55:49] and makes a war against the woman number
[55:51] the woman with the 12 to 12 crowns I'm
[55:54] sorry
[55:54] 12 I mean I'll sure let me go to that
[55:58] revelation 12 my man tells his
[56:00] revelation 12 there's nothing new with
[56:01] the bride it's the Jews okay she's got
[56:05] she's got a woman clothed with the Sun
[56:07] and the moon under feet and she's got a
[56:10] crown of 12 stars not 12 crowns a crowd
[56:12] with 12 stars
[56:13] forgive me next Antiochus was a deceiver
[56:19] and advice will be a master deceiver
[56:21] that's right the Bible said he deceives
[56:23] through unrighteousness in other words
[56:25] he lets them stin and tell them they're
[56:27] okay with God that's what we can't do
[56:30] here right guys come against all sin
[56:32] Antiochus was proud Antichrist will be a
[56:35] mega Romania I'm not sure that beats
[56:39] probably a real prideful person I don't
[56:42] know if megalomaniac I'm not sure I
[56:44] don't know Antiochus lasting God as the
[56:48] enterprise
[56:49] he sits in the temple of God saying that
[56:51] he has God he exalts himself above all
[56:53] that's all God which is the word
[56:55] eventually exalts himself above the word
[56:58] and last but not least Antiochus was not
[57:01] killed by human hands and neither will
[57:03] the Antichrist
[57:04] he's killed by the sword that comes out
[57:06] the mouth the price at Armageddon and
[57:08] then he's instantly cast in the lake of
[57:09] fire at that battle so he's not killed
[57:13] by another man he's killed by Christ
[57:15] amen holiday just like Michael beat
[57:18] Lucifer ahead just like Christ defeated
[57:21] Satan on Calvary amen he said it's
[57:24] finished hallelujah he's beaten by
