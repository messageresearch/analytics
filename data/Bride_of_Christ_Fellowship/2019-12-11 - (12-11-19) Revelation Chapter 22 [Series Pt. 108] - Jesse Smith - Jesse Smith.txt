let's take our Bibles here tonight by God's grace if you were let's go to Revelation chapter 22 verse 1 I like to this revelation series Lord willing and maybe we'll finish it tonight we'll see maybe Sunday by God's grace see how many services the Lord allows us to preach here on chapter 22 thank the Lord thank the Lord thank the Lord praise God thank the Lord let's read verse 1 there we'll just read that one verse let's just do that we'll try to conserve time tonight by God's grace let's all read revelation 22 verse 1 let's read that together let's begin on three one two three and he showed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of God and of the lamb they got as busing Torinos word may be seated tonight my country it's good to be in house Lord tonight praise God and good to see the Saints here Lord willing we'll try to look at revelation 22 I think this is part one hundred and eight so I look back and when I saw when I started this series and it was on August 21st 2016 so over three years ago so I've kind of stretched it you know of course I did a lot of series in the in the in-between but I've just tried to keep coming back to Revelation so like I can I can have a part of my testimony I preached the whole book of Revelation to you and the Bible says blessed is he then here's the word of God amen blessed is he who hears the word reads it but more blessed is he who keeps the Word of God thank the Lord a lot of people here a lot of churches hear it but it's more blessed to keep the Word of God to do the Word of God praise the Lord now I want to just start here with a few of the highlights here look at the themes here tonight there's three main themes that I see here of course there could be more but the first one is the the throne of the New Jerusalem the chapter begins with the throne and then it gets next into the supreme deity of Jesus Christ and then I feel like the the last and third theme if I could say there's three themes perhaps would be Christ's invitations his warnings and his blessings we see that in chapter 22 so let's look at those a little bit tonight by God's grace I got a lot of thoughts and more willing we'll just see how the Lord guides it so let's look at the throne first praise God quite a picture here of the throne it's described in verses the first six verses and we see a pure river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Tree of Life and we'll look a little bit more at the trees here in just a moment we see or the tree rather and we see leaves on the tree have a purpose then we see the servants of God who look at and behold the Lambs face and serve Him and we see how the lamb gives light to everyone under this unending rain praise God of the New Jerusalem that's the first theme is the throne of God next is the supreme deity of Jesus Christ a major theme of the this final chapter doctor I don't know if you'd ever noticed this but I love this thought I don't know how this came to me maybe it was in the church age book I don't remember but it's beautiful Christ ends this book by reminding the readers of his titles from the opening chapters so in verse in Revelation chapter 22 verse 13 he said I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end and the first and the last praise God in verse 16 he said I'm the root and offspring of David and the bright and Morning Star hallelujah so he called himself Alpha and Omega in chapter 1 verse 8 when John Psalm he called himself the beginning in the end in chapter 1 verse 8 he called himself the first and the last in chapter 1 verse 11 he called him that he was called the root and offspring of David in chapter 5 verse 5 and the church age book he was called the bright and Morning Star as a reward to the overcomer in Revelation 228 what is Christ trying to do he's trying to close the book by further Revere further proving that he is God that he is supreme deity not a second person not a third but the only person praise God and it's a beautiful picture because remember the word revelation means unveiling it means appearing it means manifesting it means the closure disclosure rather so it's the book of unveiling and so he starts the book by unveiling who he is he teaches on the great drama of the end times the whole church ages the last two thousand years of history and then ends by revisiting the fact that he is the first in the last he's the Alpha and Omega the beginning in the end and if I can quote Isaiah he was the everlasting father the mighty God the Prince of Peace praise God he's the all and all he sees the all of it he's the Amen praise God this is the great second theme is the supreme deity of Jesus Christ he wants the reader and I hope you're reading this on your own sometime soon praise God if you haven't lately hallelujah he's he's trying to convince the reader that he is the the one and only image of the invisible God and not just part of God not 1/3 of God but the fullness of the Godhead bodily dwells in him according to Colossians 2 verse 9 amen what a theme he starts off the book with supreme deity and he ends the book with supreme deity praise God the third theme is the invitation he gives the warnings and the blessings now numerous times in the chapter you'll see the scripture inviting the believer to come to Christ in verse 17 the spear and the bride say come let him that under here say come that him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely praise God then he says surely I come quickly so he's saying come to me but he's letting you know I'm coming to you quickly amen to all those who come to me I'm coming to you praise God and then John says even so come Lord Jesus praise God it's the great invitation we looked at it a few weeks ago and the Bible says that he said whosoever will write verse 17 and whosoever will let him take of the water of life freely and we know it's not natural water because if natural water could give eternal life you wouldn't have need of the Holy Spirit praise God so it's speaking of spiritual water it's speaking of the Holy Spirit he's God amen so he invites all whosoever will let him come now of course his predestination and his foreknowledge knows who will come but he still must invite because we don't know so it gives us the Commission and it gives us the duty to responsibility to tell our neighbour about Jesus we have to because we don't know if they know him or not praise God it gives us it gives us ganas it gives us something to do pray God it gives us a ministry so that we can say we worked for the Lord we worked with the Lord we didn't work against him we didn't neglect our calling we worked for the Lord day man this great universal invitation oh it's so it's so wide open praise God every person has this great opportunity to come to Jesus Christ for waters of life but he also in the myths of the invitations he gives numerous warnings he warns us three times that he's coming quickly because three is perfection praise God verse seven behold I come quickly red-letter words next verse 12 and behold I come quickly did you catch it and then verse twenty surely I come quickly aha church it ought to put us on our spiritual toes praise God I behold I come quickly behold I come quickly surely I come quickly can he can he make it any more plain praise God now that word quickly if you look in the Greek I got a little definition on it it can mean quickly like in a short amount of time it can mean soon but it doesn't have to one of the definitions means without delay or soon or one of them is suddenly and we can see after 2000 or 2001 'only not to us we think suddenly is right now or next week or tomorrow but it applies both ways it's suddenly in God's time but it's suddenly as far as the rapture will be a sudden secret going away praise God so when he said behold I come quickly he means suddenly like a thief in the night praise God behold I come quickly I come like a thief in the night to snatch away my bride I preach at the middle school on Wednesday and the kids were like what he's going to come like a thief in the night and it's the first I could actually see in their eyes the revelation struck them that they realized the rapture comes before the tribulation you know these twelve and thirteen-year-olds and they just they're looking at me like all scared because I was saying like he comes like a thief in the night I said there's a thief kind of knock 8:00 p.m. and say hey I'll be back at midnight be waiting up for me have some hot chocolate ready for me no a thief's gonna night he's going to wait till you leave and you're on vacation or he's gonna wait to you're going he know he watches your move and then he's gonna sneak in suddenly without warning and Jesus said I'm coming back that way Church let us not get complacent with that let us let us hear that and let us act upon that let us be ready for the coming of the Lord he has to say it three times Saints behold I come quickly behold I come quickly surely I come quickly oh my what a gracious Lord no one be able to say on that day well Lord you didn't tell me you were coming quickly because it'll be your right there three times in the last book of the Bible praise God the last chapter of the Bible constantly warning repeatedly warning that I come quickly I come suddenly but he also gives multiple blessings praise God look at verse seven we all I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book see it's more than just hearing it if I go back to chapter one I believe it's verse three if I'm not mistaken blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of the prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand see our time is so fleeting that the Bible is true by saying the time of the coming of the Lord is at hand because we don't know when our time is gonna end we've got to be ready at all times praise God blessed is he who keep the sayings of the book verse 12 I like what he says behold I come quickly and this is such an encouragement and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be raised god amen that'll make you happy if you're doing all you can for Christ because we know you know your works are all day to get dedicated toward him you're all the money you have is for the kingdom of God or take care of your family or to help out pay your tithes and offerings how about the missionary and give people Bibles or give people money you know all your works are doing something to help other people praise God so he says I'm coming with my reward praise God and so these are the great themes we see of the chapter now there's more to that but I want to move on now let's look at some symbols and key revelations here and when I wrote this I think two years ago these were just some of the main thoughts as I prayed and studying and meditating on these were some of the main thoughts that kind of came to me as I was writing this so there's our the the symbol of The Tree of Life the servants at the throne the four still conditions the spirit and the bride and a warning to keep from adding or taking away from the book praise God now let's look at the Tree of Life look at verse two here in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river was there the Tree of Life now I don't understand that either side of the river The Tree of Life I don't kind understand that I don't know if the roots are above-ground and the roots go down on both sides of the river I'm not even sure Church if it's a literal tree because both man of the church age book says the Tree of Life was Jesus and the tree nouns good evil was Satan so I'm not even sure it is a tree but we look at the tree and the bottom here we see the Tree of Life returning to the earth it could be the body of Christ and be near the throat of God so you find the Tree of Life near God's throne on either side of the river either symbolically or literally in Genesis chapter 2 and 3 The Tree of Life was in the midst of the garden because the sin of Adam and Eve the husband and wife had caused them to be denied access to the Tree of Life but now in the New Jerusalem the pure sinless holy conditions of the original Garden of Eden have been restored God's great plan of redemption has been completed and as he first gained preeminence in his son Jesus Christ then he gained preeminence to the Gentile bride of Jesus Christ the second purpose of God and now God has again a sinless husband and wife Jesus Christ and his wife back in perfect fellowship in an eternal Eden with the Tree of Life again hey Larry so the the Bible ends with uh we'd say a better we say a renewed image of the first beginning of Genesis praise God a husband and wife with the Tree of Life that's how we started but Satan got into it with adultery but here at the end of the world we have a husband and a wife and there's only going to be holiness and purity and faithfulness amen with the Tree of Life oh my this whole Redemption stories about a husband and wife why do they keep selling all these movie tickets all these romance video movies is because everybody loves a good love story and there's no better love story than of Christ in the church amen hallelujah so we see it back in perfect fellowship again is a tree of life and a physical tree I don't know to me I would think it's a symbolic but the Bible says that this tree of life bears twelve manner of fruits and yielded through every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nation so I'm not sure why there's 12 other than you know God had twelve tribes of Israel so perhaps God will would divide the whole earth into 12 sections and then each each apostle the Bible said will judge the 12 tribes of Israel perhaps that's it Amen I don't know because usually we know there's nine fruits of the spirit right but here there's 12 fruits and therefore the healing of the nation's the Bible says and verse 3 there shall be no more curse but the throne of God and of the lamb shall be in it and his servants shall serve them now notice it's so beautiful church the Bible calls it one throne not two Thrones one throne right and so we see it's they called the throne of the Lamb and the throne of God praise God because God is the invisible and the lamb is the visible brother Graham said he'll sit at that top of the pyramid and he said the father will hover over the son as a pillar of fire but the body will be the son but the pillar of fire will be the father amen praise God man so it's no two Thrones it's one throne the revelation of the Godhead the image of the invisible God Jesus Christ the program said that is the final resting place of the Heavenly Father's Spirit is the body of Jesus Christ now now we see the servants at the throne now this seems to refer to all the born-again Holy Ghost filled believers which would include the New Testament church and I believe also the 144,000 Jewish remnant because Daniel saw them in Daniel 7 verse 10 praise God in Revelation 14 verse 4 the 144,000 were called servants of God and the Bible said they were sealed in their foreheads and boy Darrin tells us who serves the husband but his wife praise God so we see Christ and his wife and the 144,000 those who are sealed with the Holy Ghost around the throne of God the Bible said that they have the right to live and reign forever and ever look at verse 5 and there shall be no night there and they need no candle neither light of the Sun for the Lord God giveth them light and they shall reign Church forever and ever praise God amen ah if we just thought were gonna reign for a thousand years we got news for you the reign of the believer is eternal praise God because God trusts you if God can trust you right now with eternal life praise God then he can trust you with that same life ruling over his creation for all eternity so see the responsibility never stops God children God's children born again don't run away from responsibility they accept it and they stand up in it and they reign with the Spirit of Christ but you see somebody that runs from their ministry or runs from their calling in life they're not born again yet because John's talking about people that are born again that live and reign with Christ for a thousand years and then the future home they reign eternally oh my thank the Lord see why it's so important as I've been preaching on your purpose to find your purpose in life because it's all time programs that whatever you are here you will be there you'll not be something new over there you'll be the same thing you were here so god help us to find what we're to do reign for Christ in that position under that office and that will be the same thing over there praise God amen beautiful I forgot about that that's a blessing my verse five I forgot about that whew reign forever and ever what a promise and that fulfills the promise that John said we'd be kings and pray and rain on the earth in Revelation 1 6 at revelation 5:5 ye are kings and priests unto God he said we shall reign with him on the earth praise God the next key revelation is the four spiritual conditions in revelation 22 11 he that is unjust let him be unjust still he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that's righteous let him be righteous still and he that's holy let him be holy still see you'll find as we find out through the Bible everybody ends up in one of these four spiritual conditions to are saved and to her lost there's two that are worthy of eternal life the wise and the foolish version there's two that are worthy of the second death that make believer in the unbeliever this is all through the scripture Jesus tells the parable on the four kinds of grounds that's the seed falls on there's not three there's not two there's not one there's four kinds of hearts in Matthew chapter 13 2nd Timothy chapter 2 verse 20 says there's four kinds of vessels that God has gold silver those are the same or would an earth are the lost praise God I would say and we know church at the Jesus's crucifixion there wasn't really three crosses there was four right Jesus and the same thief and then Judas and then the lost thief there's always these four it's a great revelation that we have to recognize and we have to make sure that our lives are not our lives are beyond righteous see it's righteous to say Jesus Christ died for my sins I'm a sinner I repent forgive me my sins that's righteous but it's something else to say I want to be holy to let the Holy Ghost live inside of me praise God to dwell in my soul and have pre evidence and rulership over every area of my life that my life is more than righteous its holy praise God that's what a lot of churches don't have today holiness they don't want address holy they don't want to live holy right they don't want to talk holy they don't look at holy things but you and I should be holy rollers praise God amen we should be our names on the roll in heaven we should be holy rollers Amen our names on the roll praise God thank the Lord like I always remember what brother died he said he said oh yeah I like he said I believe in rock and roll he said Jesus is my rock and my name is on the roll in heaven that's never left me all these years I love that see the Bible still picks it up that whatever we are here will continue to be it for the rest of eternity praise God oh my I wish you make sure every day as we were saying on Sunday morning the Holy Spirit saying prove it make your calling election short prove it prove which side you're on he that's on the Lord's side let him come on the Lord's side praise God prove it make it sure that the devil's know which side you're on praise God let the Angels know which side you're on let your family know which side you're on prove it to everybody praise God live according to the dictates of your heart and if the Word of God is written on your heart you'll certainly live the Word of God thank the Lord Oh hallelujah praise the Lord now with a blessing great revelation it's laid right here at the end of the Bible the four types of conditions you can be in this last one here but I got a couple more the invitation yes the spirit and the bride say come and take of the water of life this is a key revelation because it shows God will always use men who are filled with the Holy Ghost to save other men praise God it's not the spirit only saying come it's the spirit and the bride saying come it's not the Spirit and just the Prophet saying come if the spirit and the bride because the Prophet is part of the bride well this can be more important church as we get closer to the end it's gonna be more important that you and I are the voice of God when we speak God's Word like brother a witness and that man named Michael that's the voice of God if Ray is speaking God's Word then he's God's voice to that man and who else Halas are your friends and family going to hear except you and i open our mouths and let God's Word flow out praise God the Holy Spirit always has and always will speak through the bride the New Testament church the Spirit does this we know through the five preaching gifts although they try to change it today we know in Jefferson middle they're changing they're getting rid of the four and calling all the other four tape boys I'm sorry they're calling the other three tape boys they got the Prophet brother RAM they got their pastor Brett rogram son and they make all the other three the tape boys they're all tape boys because nobody else is supposed to preach and see what they've done is they've cut off the Word of God who wants a hand that only has two fingers anybody want a hand that has two fingers huh no I don't so see to take one word away is to have your name taken out of the book of life and may God be merciful that Souls can find repentance and believe the truth or I'll trust by like I'll say like this that did it in ignorance if they never repent of it that they did it in ignorance that God can have mercy on them that's right see it's the spirit and the bride the bride is the mouthpiece of God on earth if you want to be ready for the second coming you must submit to the pattern Christ left for us praise God Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen so we see that clearly the spirit and the bride say come if you got him in here let me pull this quote up here I think I read it a few weeks ago maybe I didn't program said on numerous occasions that anyone can be a voice of God so Brad never said I'm the only one that can be God's voice but I've never said that now we know he is the prophetic voice of this age and the church said he's the voice the seventh angels voice but that doesn't delete or do away with revelation 22:17 right because they're still because if that voice is gone there still needs to be a bride's voice amen because God always has a witness he said I'll never leave myself without a living witness praise God that's right and brother a voice makes it plain he said I was only a voice that he used to say it uh it wasn't what I knew it's what I surrendered myself to that he spoke through he said that's not my voice it's my voice but not me using it he said that voice is speaking then was not my voice it was my voice but I wasn't operating it but I said listen my dad says I'm not his gift the Spirit is his gift raised God see many groups today worship the body or the flesh above the man and he says I'm not his gift the Spirit is his gift this is not my voice it just picks up my voice so whenever program says they'll say the Lord it's really not him it's God just borrowing the voice brother Ram is not the gift right but the Holy Spirit is the gift that we are still hearing today praise God hey bad that's right so true same thing with Elijah you say oh yeah Elijah was God's voice yes no doubt about it but it wasn't God's voice when he said he's in the cave he said I'm the only one left and God said I've got seven thousand was that God's voice I'm the only believer left all right which I would have been there two out of men saying the same thing you so would you right if somebody threatened us and we got in the flesh but God had to correct him see God one of them stay wrong God had to correct him and say you're not the only one there's seven thousand and having bowed the knee now look what brother Aaron says in the church age book three quotes the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God's being of denominational God will confound her is a false church system through the Prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her see who's God's voice in you next quote oh gods he said Oh God still has a voice for the people of the world even he is yes he has given a voice to the bride that voice is in the bride as we have said praise God amen you know let's just use simonez exam when Simon goes to Thailand and gives them perhaps perhaps sister Beatrice perhaps that's their only chance some of them be able to hear the voice of God right by the rain most people may get one chance to hear God's voice when Simon does a little Bible study and they've got a choice am I going to hear the voice of God or am I not gonna hear the voice of God because jesus said the end will not come until every nation has had the gospel preached unto them should we know brother Craig would go to Japan we know the different brothers go you know down to Central America and do great works down there they are God's voice God is speaking he's giving them a chance he's inviting them he's saying come drink of the waters of life freely he says it over and over come to Christ Jesus this is my favorite one right here because this this nips all those false jeffersonville doctrines that nip some right away but if said the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they say will have already been said in the word praise God ain't it I love it because it makes me rejoice when I say what's in the Bible I know God's talking through me praise God when I turn down the false and I go away from my idea and I just preach God's Word that I know that God I can leave here I out here tonight and say thank the Lord God's voice spoke it wasn't mine he just borrowed my voice amen I'm not God's gift the Holy Spirit is God's gift amen and when he speaks the words of the believer it's God's voice and they've got to receive it remember that poem said the force the fourth seal in that preeminent preliminary part before he taught on the fourth seal the the the pale horse rider remember what he said but never said if people shout or jump during the song service or speak in tongues or scream or dance that's fine he said as long as they live right he said but that's not actually when life comes but man said life comes while the word is being preached they then see that's that's the sad part Church many times I see people more excited about worship than they are about the word but the reality of it is more life should flow to us as we hear the word and say amen to the word a life of God should come to us through that if we're really pulling on the Word of God amen you say show me a scripture for that I would love to show you scripture for that amen let's go to Acts chapter 10 well they have said it over and over life comes through the word yes you get refreshed when the song service is going on and you come in here discourage you're depressed sore tired and then real brother amen sings just the right song yeah that moves all the demons but now you still need anointing praise God I better have said that life life only comes through the word Amen he said the word is actually the thing that brings life the most happy you should be is during the preaching of the word amen at least that's how I feel amen I'm sure you do too acts 10:44 whoever said life the actual life comes while the preaching of the word is happening remember that Cobra I read to you last year program said he said if the preaching of God won't pep you up nothing will if God's Word doesn't move you then you're not going to be moved because Jesus said my words are spear and death no he said my words are spirit and life amen oh it's so important to just say amen and thank the Lord for the word and praise Him and worship Him well the word is being preached because the world only has live female acts 10:44 that's many times as we find out we find out who has the Holy Ghost or not like I said if people don't have it they only get excited - maybe during the songs or they only get excited during fellowships but those who got the Holy Ghost get filled with life as the word is being preached ah prove it brothers yes how does life come through the word right here while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost filled up on all which sang the songs no I quote that right no it's all them that heard the word amen because light comes through God's will amen that's how life comes it's actually sitting there and receiving it something that would cause you to maybe fall down and cry and praise the Lord or rise up and say thank you it fell while he was preaching the word because life only comes through the word are they little yeah so the spirit and the profit and the bride will all be saying the same thing and what they're saying has already been said in the word I don't know how dark it's gonna get I don't know how many people are going to fall away or how small our churches gonna have to be or all these messy churches but one thing I know is that I find life and God's Word and will stay alive through the preaching of God's Word well them did not say the most important thing is someone who can push play on a tape he did not say that he said the most important thing of this day he said is a man a preacher who can rightly divide the word of truth amen the most important gift that this day is a man who can yield to the Holy Spirit to preach truth because the Holy Spirit is truth amen it is the Spirit of Truth the Holy Ghost will live the Holy Ghost Oh strewth amen and when you receive that truth to your situation when your struggle with different things that truth actually brings life amen and now you can walk out and face your giant or face your enemies with life because you're empowered through the life of God the Word of God amen hallelujah yes the songs will cast out devils and thank the Lord for that but now the house is just emptied out now it's got to be filled praise God amen glory I wanted to say that little later to preach about you just couldn't get away from it so maybe I'll preach again Sunday I wanted amen and bang to hear that you know all the saints and Karen and I want all of them to hear that life only comes through the word so we must we must be especially listening during the preaching of the word even if we've heard it before we must keep pulling on a pony because maybe we got to create an atmosphere for those who haven't heard it before or maybe we need another a greater understanding of that praise now who doesn't need more of God who doesn't more understanding praise God who doesn't need a fresh reality of the day of Pentecost and praying that it'll strike in your family praise God or to strike in your home a man or to strike on the job who doesn't need more of that praise God amen Bushman lawson's we had a baptism here who was the last of the bed got baptized was it Karras it's been too long praise God may God give us a baptism amen so no pressure on Victoria but she's three years old no she's four no pressure but what I'm saying is that we should long to see people saying we should learn to see people come to Jesus Christ because he's saying come because I'm coming quickly now listen I got too close to program says every person can be the voice of God and yet today people Jeffersonville will say there's only one voice of God you're not the voice of God brother Jesse you're not the true fivefold ministry until until you play a tape huh I thought they'd believe everything on the tapes but apparently they don't they only believe what they want to believe this is from 1957 believed from the heart I've seen it work and to think that if if you'll get into that contact with God it becomes till it isn't your voice anymore it's not your song anymore it becomes God saw and God's voice you are just a vine or a branch he's the vine who's God's voice you are when you can think God's thoughts and meditate on them and then speak God's Word now you're God's voice he said here's the next one church 1961 serves me would see Jesus God speaks through him he's normal his own but he's God's voice through the human lips and every believer in him tonight is likewise possessed so possessed so completely given over till his words become like the words of Christ every believer when they're so possessed with God's Spirit they become God's lips to them hear a praise God not just some believers not just brothers not just sisters but every believer when that possessed with the Holy Spirit become God's voice to somebody else not were they ever gonna do with those quotes well they'll never play those tapes so the people won't know they're you're exactly off the hair is that right they won't see they'll say what they want to say nope helps you I'm building that on revelation 22:17 the spirit and the bride say come and what they have already say will be set in the Word of God already praise God all right now the warnings about the contents of the book are a key revelation showing that God demands respect accountability and reverence for every word of God jesus said we live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God a revelation 22:18 and 19 says anyone who adds to the book of Revelation where plagues add to them anyone who takes away from the book of Revelation will have his part out of the book of life and the holy city mine is that right holy city oh mercy Lord that proves they won't even have a part in the holy city anyone who adds I've never seen it like that before anyone who adds or takes away loses the opportunity to be a bride member and to be in the holy city wow that just discounts a lot of preachers right there right discounts a lot of church members right there when they add to the word or they take away from the word usually it's take away like they take away the part about women having long hair or take away the part about men having short hair they take that away and the Bible said if they take away his part will be taken out a book of life and out of the holy city what a striking statement but see a real preachers like Paul in acts 20 20 verse 27 I don't read that because I'm gonna mess it up if I don't verse 27 here's a real preacher now look what Paul says for I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God amen Paul was in the when he went to those churches Paul laid down the whole thing he preached the cross repentance he preached justification sanctification baptism only ghosts he preached the whole Council of God he didn't leave anything out because he knew if he took away from it his part would be taken out he knew if he added to it the plagues will be add to him so he preached the whole thing and God help us to do the same thing praise God that's my desire to preach the whole thing preach the whole book of Revelation praise God almost done race God to preach the whole Bible praise God all the revelations all the counsel of Jesus Christ to this legacy in church age I must preach the whole counsel and not take anything away now if Sir prett added one word in Genesis 3:4 now that's a big word not not makes everything contrary it's a big word though one word with a big word remember proverbs 30 verse 5 and 6 tells us the same thing every word of God is pure he's a shield unto them that put their trust in him add now not unto his words lest he reprove thee and thou be found a liar see Church that's why the Bible said all the liars will have their place in the lake of fire that's why the Bible said Liars will not enter into that City God hates Liars because they're taking away from his truth God just wants his people to know what's right praise God to know the truth he said all Liars will miss eternal life think about that these preachers that are adding to his words or saying things the Bible doesn't say God will have the Bible laying there and of course their lives will be a book and the things and then there the lives the book of their lives will be added to the things that were in the book and Jesus will have to tell them you lied to the people I don't want to lie to anybody here tonight I want everybody here tonight to know the truth because the truth will make you free from the world of sin that's right don't add to his words he'll call you a liar if you add to his words or take them away yes they Adhan say oh yeah women can preach they add to the Word of God oh see Deborah was a Deborah prophesied sahel all women can preach now that's adding she was a judge not a priestess you're adding to the Word of God now if you do it ignorant Lee the Bible said God is merciful he winks at ignorance but they do it on purpose and they know what the Bible says then they're guilty of being a liar and God won't let them inherit the things of God because they lied to the people praise God thank God for the Spirit of Truth hallelujah my thank the Lord now the timing of this I'm moving on now to the timing the timing is chronological because it's the New Jerusalem is the first five verses at the beginning of verse six until the end of the book there's a break in the visions of the New Jerusalem and we're given repeated warnings and blessings and then we see three times Jesus says behold I come quickly I just want to go further for tonight I don't want to go too far because I got a whole lot more I could say here there will be so many liars look what the Bible says God is so worthy of your love how many believe that tonight the Bible says God is a jealous God if you don't love him the Bible said he's jealous that you don't love him because he gives you all these things he gives you life he gives you food and health and a body that so it works so marvelously right he's given us so much that if we don't love him he becomes jealous and look did you know that Paul pronounced this curse upon anyone that doesn't love the Lord Jesus Christ did you know Paul put a curse on them 1st corinthians 16:22 he pulled up their acacia we already know Galatians 1 he said if you changed the gospel he says your curse but here he says if people can't get in their hearts to love Jesus Christ they're cursed now we don't know how long that curse will last if it's just temporary maybe they'll get saved within their life like the thief on the cross right we know there's generational curses right remember remember David had three years of famine because of Saul's sins remember that David didn't do it we had to suffer with the curses of the previous generation many times whether a will suffer in life because of the sins of the previous generations yeah no doubt about that it's right through the scripture I was studying on that I kind of got away from it because I want to finish this but I want to get to that I want to get the generational curses and I was reading on that a little bit Maya there's so many things that we don't understand even brother Branham suffered a little bit he said because his dad was a moonshiner because he was in the alcohol everybody mistreated him and he had a bad name the brand name was a bad name because of his dad look at this first corinthians 16:22 If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be anathema maranatha first corinthians 16:22 anathema means a religious band executed accursed if any man doesn't love Jesus Christ let him be executed let him be a curse and Maranatha means our Lord has come it also means approaching divine judgment anyone that doesn't love the Lord Jesus Christ your curse because there's an approaching divine judgment he deserves our love tonight we should be happy to come to church amen I know this guy doesn't like it but you got to keep slapping this guy say wake up a man wake up obey the soul obey the nature that's inside this body praise God because this body's under the curse praise God but see when you love Jesus Christ your souls not under the curse your soul is blessed amen your soul is fast weary praise God but anyway that does it love the Lord Jesus Christ is cursed excommunicated and divine judgment comes upon him maranatha our Lord is coming in divine judgment and it's at the end of the book he closes the Corinthian work with this and this was the book remember this is the book of the man that slept with his stepmother said deliver that man there Satan that his soul might be saved this guy didn't play around Paul the play if they don't love Jesus Christ let him be cursed now look at this my look at verse 30 23 first he gives the warning of cursing but then he says verse 23 the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you I don't want the curse I love Jesus Christ so I get his grace amen I don't get his judgment I get his grace cuz I love him amen I love him because I keep his word amen he's in love with me is he that keepeth my commandments praise God amen hallelujah verse 24 my love be with you all in Christ Jesus he magic church the Corinthian could feel Paul's love they read his letter and they can feel Paul loves us why cuz he's trying to straighten them out he's trying to get them to obey Christ in everything he's trying to get their gift straightened out he's trying to get their their sex life straightened out their personal lives he's trying to get the whole church cleaned up and rebuking them but he says the grace of Christ be with you and my love is with you in Christ Jesus that's how you know somebody loves you they're able to correct you praise God they know if they've got to then they'll have to correct you at some point my see churches it's really not it's really not rocket science I mean either you love the things of the world or you love the Lord Jesus Christ it's what the other if you don't love Jesus Christ all that awaits is a curse that's what the Bible says that's why there'll be a lot of liars go to hell cuz they say I love Jesus Lord Lord have we not prophesied have we not done all these things he said I never knew your love you gave your love to everything else except me you never really loved me you kept living an addiction filled life you're a slave in this addiction you're a worker of iniquity you never loved me to begin with but who gets to heaven those who do the will of my father praise God those who did what father said are the ones that love me praise God not the ones who ran away from what the word says and the Bible says when people leave the church the Bible said they separate themselves not having the Holy Spirit you'll find the Holy Ghost filled Saint he'll always be with the Saints she always be over the Saints why because she got the same spirit if someone separates themselves they don't have the Holy Spirit very easy very easy to see praise God yeah we know those pretenders that hang around hang around hang around but by their fruits you shall know them give them the word test praise God aunt Athena accursed Maranatha approaching divine judgment if anyone love not the Lord Jesus Christ how could you not love somebody that took the cross for you that took the nails for you that took the slaps and the beatings and the pulling out of the beard and took the spitting in the face and the whips on the back how could you not love how can we not love somebody that did so much for us praise God hey man I don't know somebody watch that movie the pasture to not love Jesus Christ see him I just remember that where he'd get whipped and he falls down and they're all laughing and then he gets back up he's like okay give me some more and he's you know he's bleed and everything like that every time he gets knocked down he's like I'll take some more take something for emphasis I'll take some first murder and they got right he said I'll take some for Leo to see yeah hey man Leo said how could you not love him he said such matches love amen how could we not love such a God as that Amen a holy faithful worthy God and innocent pure man taking on our pain and our shame and our guilt or something I love Jesus Christ amen I will not be anathema will be blessed amen I will not be cursed and fall in love with Satan's devices and the things of the world for our love righteousness and holiness he'll be a true child of God amen that's why they'll be liars because they'll say I love God I went to church I love this and they didn't love it at all they couldn't wait til when is he gonna stop preaching and God's like I'm trying to pour life on you I'm trying to the longer the sermon the more life thank you our a man the more word the more word to those who want life amen praise God thank you lord that's why they'll be liars oh I love Jesus I love you lord they never did in the first place bunch of liars and yet they can live physically pure their whole life but they lie and never love Jesus Christ there be liars they'll be cursed because they love the things of the world more than they love Christ that's right it was funny you know this is not I'm not you know I was get my haircut on Monday and I was having nice little conversation with the barber you know she's the owner there's a bunch of people there she's like going to get your Christmas tree up I said no we don't set one up I said we just do like a little nativity scene you know got one for the adults and one for the children just like you know no toys that the kids come in and boy the conversation really changed right there and I felt like you know now I've stopped preaching before trees not gonna send you to hell unless you worship the tree right because I doubters will not inherit the kingdom of God but even bro bran put up a tree so but for me church for me I can see right as soon as you start going a little bit against the grain of people everything changes you find out if they really love you or not so see we ought to be able to disagree with people and still think highly of them and still love them because we love Christ and we can love those who are lovable but we can also love those who are unlovable I caught that this week my soon as I said that was something against the great Oh conversation ends right now but you can still be kind you can still be sweet and I know if they're saying have a great week I'll see you next week for the haircut I'll see you in two weeks before Christmas with a haircut if they let me back in now Majan see it love it's loving Christ I love with this and I've done this this year already I tell my wife I said I got to come up with a saying about Merry Christmas where I can say the name of Jesus and so I've done it three or four times this year people say Merry Christmas and I'll make sure I say yeah Merry Christmas thank God that he sent His Son Jesus Christ I say that and I kind of watch their face and see what they're gonna say so they're like covering like a man could speak that name Jesus you'll find out what's in their heart do they love it or do they not love it it's a good time the year to pull up that name of Jesus oh my what does it call that what does it all come down to it comes all down to love thank God that we love Jesus Christ what a blessing to love the Lord amen now looking at my notes here I want to make sure I get everything here yeah let me just find one more thing to close with by God's grace I'll preach one more message on revelation 22 yeah let's go to the last words revelation 22 I just thought this was an inspired thought what were the last words Jesus Christ recorded in Scripture you remember program said this is the only book in the Bible that Jesus Christ actually wrote how many memory said that because he told John write this write that write this write that write this in a book sending out to the people don't hold on to it send it out but Ram said the book of Revelation he said is the most official book of the Bible because Jesus Christ is the one who commissioned it to be written down a man himself and what's his last words Church in verse 20 he which testifies of these things saith surely I come quickly amen even so come Lord Jesus what beautiful words to end this letter the last words we'd read the last red letter words would be a promise truly how come suddenly truly I'll come quickly those are some beautiful words Church we have some other last words I remember the last words of Stephen who was the martyr the first martyr what were his last words he said I see heaven opened and I see Jesus Christ standing at the right hand of the Father Great God he said Father forgive them they don't know what they're doing laid out their sins to their charge and the Bible said he closed his eyes and went to sleep and the Bible said they threw stones at him and he died a man such notable last words what is he speaking expressing the desire of forgiveness the desire for salvation and it's very last words he testifies there's a God in heaven his name is Jesus and he's standing at the right for a right handed off road and he's here to forgive sins amen hallelujah what last what amazing last words those are church wonder what our last words will be praise God you know some of the last words I heard my coach remember my coach died back in January of last year remember that my track coach we want to state championship together and a state runner-up together some of the last words I ever said to him I said mister kosher I said are you trusting in Jesus Christ for salvation and I recorded on my phone I know maybe I should not have done that but I did it anyway because I wanted to proof I wanted to see what it would this man say what are his last words to me gonna be I said are you trusting in Jesus Christ for your salvation he said yes Jesse yes I'm trusting in Jesus Christ I said are you trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ he said yes I'm trusting in Jesus all the way I thought what amazing last words he said to me praise God I don't think he ever talked to me after that ever again because the next few days he was in coma and died hey brother hey you know what the last words I read while he was alive I took my Bible out and I didn't oh he's gonna die that night I didn't know I just let the Holy Spirit I opened up to Paul's last letter of 2nd Timothy and then his uh his cousin sent me a text a few hours later and said he just passed on my last words I read to him I said I read these words 2nd Timothy 4 verse 6 4 I'm now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand I fought a good fight I finished my course I have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them that love is appearing praise God hey man I didn't know I was gonna be last time I'd ever see him on this earth he would read the Bible 25 times ray and he was a Roman he was a Roman Catholic but I asked him on his deathbed are you trusting in anything else or you trusted in Jesus Christ he said I'm trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ I got it on tape right here all the last words are so important praise God amen what were the feasts last words on the cross the same thing he said remember me when you come into your kingdom amen jesus said today thou shall be with me in paradise what wonderful last words remember me God I'm trusting in you for salvation and see what it is it's coming to Jesus for a drink of that living water come to me all you that are thirsty and I'll satisfy your thirst well thank the Lord praise God not an area such beautiful last words surely I come quickly this last invitation to come remember what is this last invitation it is the invitation to every soul of every man and woman to come and receive salvation and the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the beauty of these last words surely I come quickly he just said five times come to me come to me come in here come there to thirsty come to me who several ones the water come come come and in his last words are I'm coming to you quickly praise God remember bro Graham said this that thirst of the soul brother Ram says you might say brother Ram is that soul thirst is that natural yes that's natural for a soul to thirst and God made you this way so that you would thirst for him he wants you to thirst after him praise God so God placed this thirst in every soul not the flesh not the spirit but the soul God placed a thirst brother Ram calls it a holy thirst God puts a holy thirst in every soul to have God satisfy that thirst and so Jesus ends the book the last book of the Bible by inviting the souls not the flesh not the spirit he invites the Souls come to me if you're thirsty and I'll give you the waters of life didn't the Bible say the Word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and hence of the heart and it divides asunder the soul and the spirit what does Jesus Christ the word during this last chapter he divides the flesh from the spirit and speaks right to the soul he said if you're thirsty for spiritual water if you want life come to me and I'll give you life he said whosoever will let him come whoever's thirsty for a change life let him come unto me but they have said if he had it made you like that for that holy thirst there would be an excuse at the judgment bar you'd say I never did thirst for God but there's no excuse you do he said you might make it your wife you might make it your car you might make something else you might go to church to try to satisfy it I have nothing against going to church but that isn't the satisfaction it's to find God the Living God the God of heaven into your soul that satisfies the Lord you're enforcing that you long for the man said he made you so you could thirst for him for his fellowship let's stand to our feet the last quote Paul said thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ that's the experience brother that satisfies that holy thirst that's in you it satisfies it you don't have to do anything else about it yes he said it cleanses you the holy thirst every soul has a holy thirst to it brother Ray that's that's just astounded me these last few months see I always thought the soul was either faith or unbelief but there's more to it than that because every even every unbelief soul still has a holy thirst to know God even though they're denying and not believing they wrote and said they still have a holy thirst or else they can say I have an excuse of the day of judgment and this last chapter is all about come quench that thirst you want to feel free you want to feel satisfied you want to feel forgiven you want to feel justified come and have some of this water hey come on we said over and over he begs them it's Christ begging them come knocking on their door knocking on the hearts door come let me in and sup with me and the spear and the bride say come him that year say come let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely Church do you realize what you're saying when you say come to church you're actually saying come take the waters of life when you say do you want to come to church because you know this judgment begins in your car no judgment begins at the house of God so when you said you want to come to church you're really saying this come for the waters of life because this is where God's Word pours forth yeah program should always stay where the Spirit of God is being poured out he said stay there day and night friends gonna be there tonight amen I feel pulled it out upon me praise God because I love Jesus Christ and I'd pass them the curse I bear into the blessing place guy hey man I see the curses forgiven me sister Beatrice I see the curses leave my life amen and I see the blessings of Christ rest upon my family my church this people praise God those that love Christ we see the blessings of God upon them Hunterdon they're not addicts to slave they're not they're not down to the depths of depression or or a suicidal tendencies you know or addicted to alcohol or addicted to marijuana or addicted to pornography no we're resting from those things glory hey man when you've entered in this rest you've seized from your old works praise God like Hebrews four says I've entered in the period of rest I'm not working trying to get to heaven I'm resting knowing that heavens already inside of me praise God thank the Lord praise God musicians if you'll come god bless you children praise God what notable last words surely I come quickly and like how John answers that he says Amen so be it yes even so come Lord Jesus you know just play uh play something soft there play uh keep your mind you know what do we do I want to keep your mind state on me you know church I was kind of impressed by this chapter I thought my something just said I just start looking on what about driverless cars how close are we I went watched a
