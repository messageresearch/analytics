[16:15] prayers. Amen. Let's trust God to heal
[16:16] the cruise girls in the hospital. Then
[16:20] pray for my family of God's grace. Does

[16:26] Sisters.
[16:39] Amen. Praise God.
[16:50] Also,
[16:54] for my family,
[16:58] pray for the saints that couldn't make
[16:59] it here tonight. Ask God to bless them.
[17:02] Again, want to thank everybody for

[17:13] so special thank you for your sacrifice
[17:16] by God's grace
[17:19] like I said there's numerous people that
[17:21] call this their home church even though
[17:22] they don't physically attend here
[17:24] because they don't have a home church
[17:26] to speak to them as well we know God can
[17:29] meet these needs tonight praise God amen
[17:31] let's believe hallelujah God makes all
[17:33] things
[17:34] We're under the blood of Jesus Christ as
[17:35] we heard on Sunday. The water and the
[17:38] blood gives us atonement washes us clean
[17:40] and we're hidden. Our lives are hidden
[17:42] in Christ. Hallelujah. So, we know
[17:44] Christ hears our prayers tonight.
[17:47] Let's pray together. Father God, we
[17:48] thank you for the blood of Jesus Christ.
[17:50] Thank you for the water and the blood
[17:52] and the spirit, Lord God. Hallelujah.
[17:54] Lord, we give you thanks today.
[17:56] Hallelujah. The blood gave us an
[17:58] atonement. It gave us reconciliation.
[18:00] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord God.
[18:02] Hallelujah.
[18:04] Lord, we're your children, Lord God, by
[18:06] the blood of Jesus Christ. Israel
[18:07] doesn't have that. They're still in the
[18:09] blood of bulls and goats and they don't
[18:11] even offer sacrifices, Lord God. They're
[18:14] just trusting in your grace, Lord God.
[18:16] Lord, we have the precious blood of
[18:18] Jesus Christ tonight, Lord. Thank you,
[18:19] God. Hallelujah. That we have the holy
[18:22] blood of God. Hallelujah. As I read this
[18:24] morning, Jehovah's blood, the blood of
[18:26] God. We're thankful, Lord Jesus. God
[18:29] became a man. Hallelujah. So we know
[18:31] we're totally forgiven. There's no
[18:33] condemnation to them. They're in Christ
[18:35] Jesus. Lord, if we have uh sins we
[18:37] haven't confessed, Lord, may we confess
[18:39] them now. Forgive us of any sin. Lord
[18:41] God,
[18:43] whether unknown or whether iniquity,
[18:45] Lord God, forgive us, Lord Jesus.
[18:50] We trust, Lord, now by God's grace,
[18:51] we're forgiven. Lord, let the water of
[18:53] the word wash us, Lord, clean.
[18:55] Hallelujah. Purifies us because we're
[18:58] washed by the waters of the word. Thank
[19:00] you God for the cleansing process of the
[19:03] water. Hallelujah. The harmony that the
[19:06] blood of Jesus Christ gives us with the
[19:08] father. Hallelujah. To know Lord God
[19:10] that you hear our prayers. Thank you
[19:13] Lord God. And the Holy Spirit Lord that
[19:15] gives witness with our spirit that we
[19:17] are the sons and daughters of God. Thank
[19:19] you Jesus. Hallelujah for this
[19:21] opportunity tonight to praise.
[19:25] Lord we take these requests Lord
[19:27] starting with the sick and the
[19:27] afflicted. Lord we pray you be with the
[19:30] girls, Lord, uh these great
[19:31] granddaughters, Father, be with them in
[19:33] the hospital. Give them the best
[19:35] doctors, Lord, if you choose to heal
[19:36] that way. Pray for divine healing, Lord,
[19:39] or miracles for their intestines in
[19:40] Jesus Christ's name. Hallelujah.
[19:42] Believing the word of God. Hallelujah.
[19:45] The promises of God, their yay and amen
[19:47] in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah. You ever
[19:49] live to make intercession, make
[19:51] intercession, I pray, to the father,
[19:52] dear Lord. Hallelujah. For the cruise
[19:55] girls, Lord, for healing to the
[19:56] intestines in Jesus Christ's holy name.
[20:00] Pray for Sister Zur, God. We ask for a
[20:01] miracle. She's believing for a miracle.
[20:03] We put our faith with hers, Lord God.
[20:05] Hallelujah. We lift this request up to
[20:07] you, God. And we ask Almighty God, Lord,
[20:09] to stop, Lord, this uh degradation,
[20:12] whatever it may be, Lord God. And we ask
[20:14] for restoration in her teeth in Jesus
[20:17] Christ's name for the glory of God.
[20:19] Lord, we lift it up to you because it's
[20:20] important to our sister. It's important
[20:22] to the body of Christ, Lord. When one
[20:24] member suffers, we all suffer. When one
[20:26] one member rejoices, we all rejoice.
[20:28] Lord God, make us to rejoice. Lord, I
[20:30] pray by answer these requests for the
[20:32] cruise girls and sisters serve. And I
[20:35] pray, Lord, you bless my wife, Lord.
[20:37] Heal her body, Lord. How she's labored
[20:39] for these two weeks, Lord God. Heal her
[20:41] body. Touch her body in the name of
[20:43] Jesus Christ. Send the Holy Spirit, Lord
[20:45] God. Heal her body, Lord God. She feel
[20:47] good tomorrow, Lord. Touch Aacia. She
[20:49] was sick. Uh Genevie was exhausted, Lord
[20:52] God. Aaca was down, Lord God. God, I
[20:55] pray Lord God, be with them. Lydia's
[20:57] ears were hurting her. Lord God, Zion
[20:59] was tired and Lord, so many are sick.
[21:02] So, Father God, we pray, God, send your
[21:04] healing virtue, Lord God, to our family.
[21:07] We ask in the name of Jesus Christ, Lord
[21:09] God, be glorified and magnified through
[21:11] these requests, Lord God. We're your
[21:13] bride. Hallelujah. We're your church,
[21:15] Lord God. Hallelujah. We come by the uh
[21:17] by your name. We have your name. There's
[21:19] one name given unto the bride whereby we
[21:22] must be saved under heaven and earth,
[21:23] Lord God. The whole family in heaven and
[21:25] earth is named the Lord Jesus Christ. We
[21:27] come by that name Lord Jesus and ask you
[21:29] to minister to these needs Lord God.
[21:31] Lord I think now Lord of travelers will
[21:33] be traveling a few days to come home. So
[21:36] protect our precious brother. Bless him
[21:38] Lord God and thank you for his love for
[21:41] the people of God. I just pray you be
[21:43] with him Lord as he travels. Let your
[21:45] angels protect him Lord in Jesus name.
[21:48] Hallelujah.
[21:50] Father Lord meet the needs I pray of
[21:51] your people here tonight. Be with those
[21:52] who couldn't make it. speak to them and
[21:54] especially Lord to those who can make it
[21:55] here tonight. Speak to us here tonight
[21:57] for your glory, Lord Jesus. We're
[22:00] grateful for another year, Lord God.
[22:02] Hallelujah. Lord, it's a privilege to
[22:05] have another year, Lord God. So many
[22:06] people pass each year, Lord God. When I
[22:09] look out and I see all the saints still
[22:10] here, we're so grateful, Lord God, for
[22:13] this opportunity, Lord, as we've been
[22:14] looking at the Corinthian church and to
[22:16] see how you've helped our church to live
[22:17] above these things, God. All we can say
[22:19] is thank you, Lord God. And Lord, just
[22:21] let us be more consecrated, Lord,
[22:23] because the moving of the spirit comes
[22:25] to a life consecrated to the word. Help
[22:26] me to be more consecrated, Lord. Help
[22:28] each and every one to consecrate
[22:30] ourselves more here in 20126 that your
[22:32] spirit can move amongst us, God.
[22:34] Hallelujah. We believe you'll meet these
[22:36] needs, God, in your time and season, but
[22:38] of course, let everything be done
[22:39] according to thy will, Lord God. We have
[22:42] confidence in your promises, Lord Jesus.
[22:44] So bless us here tonight, Father God, in
[22:46] Jesus Christ's name. And the saints
[22:48] said, hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah.
[22:53] Hallelujah. Let's sing one more here. By
[22:54] God's grace.
[22:57] Uh higher ground.
[23:03] You put up the chorus there. Brother
[23:05] Chris
[23:19] I
[23:35] Heat. Heat.
[23:48] Heat. Heat.
[23:58] Heat. Heat.
[24:13] Heat. Heat.
[24:23] Heat. Heat.
[24:46] I understand
[24:54] this.
[25:00] Heat.
[25:04] Heat.
[25:14] Heat. Heat.
[25:26] Heat.
[25:43] Heat.
[25:53] Heat. Heat.
[26:04] Heat. Heat.
[26:18] Let me
[26:38] heat.
[26:51] Happy and we are

[27:03] Praise God. Thank God.
[27:07] Praise God.
[27:13] Let me stand.
[27:38] Amen. Hallelujah.
[27:41] I like that. I used to sing that when I
[27:42] was a boy. That just brings that good
[27:44] memories. Let's go to the word of God.
[27:46] Thank you, Malachi. Appreciate that.
[27:47] Let's go to Psalm chapter 16 here. By
[27:50] God's grace, I'm sure Malachi will try
[27:51] to get the live stream back on. Then,
[27:54] Malachi, you can switch over. got some
[27:56] scriptures to show.
[27:58] Psalm uh 168 and9
[28:02] brother from Germany sent me a quote
[28:04] today from brother Brandham and
[28:09] it had this verse in it. He was going to
[28:12] use this quote for you know his start to
[28:14] the the new year and I thought what a
[28:16] nice quote and it was about this. So my
[28:19] message tonight is I have set the Lord
[28:21] always before my face. I thought that'd
[28:23] be a good scripture there to start off
[28:25] the the new year. I mean, isn't that
[28:28] what we want? We want in everything we
[28:30] do in this year, we want to set the Lord
[28:31] before us, right? Let the Lord go before
[28:34] us on the job, in our home, in the
[28:37] church, with our personal lives, you
[28:38] know, our gifts of the Holy Spirit. We
[28:41] want to set the Lord always before our
[28:43] faces. Hallelujah. This will be my New
[28:45] Year's message here by the grace of God.
[28:58] Okay. So, yeah, my wife did just text
[29:00] and say, uh,
[29:02] sounds very faint. That could be my mic
[29:07] here.
[29:08] So, let me text you real quick. I'll
[29:10] just say how does it sound?
[29:14] So, we'll see how it goes. All right.
[29:16] Thank you, Psalm 16. Uh we'll go eight
[29:20] and nine. Now this is also I'm not going
[29:23] to preach it, but this is the chapter
[29:24] that has the resurrection hidden in it.
[29:26] Brother Chris, Satan, uh Satan knew
[29:30] Jesus was the holy one, but he didn't
[29:33] know about the resurrection. The Bible
[29:36] said they he would not have crucified
[29:38] the Lord of glory had he known that he
[29:40] was going to send the Holy Ghost like
[29:41] that.
[29:43] So God hid the verse in Psalm chapter
[29:46] 16. It's half a verse out of 10,000
[29:48] verses.
[29:49] So God was so of course he's so wise and
[29:52] smart and infinitely smart. The devil
[29:54] was uh tricked because the devil doesn't
[29:57] know much. He knows a lot but nothing
[30:00] compared to God. God bless you sister.
[30:04] Now let's read eight and nine and we'll
[30:06] just read 10 because that's the
[30:08] resurrection scripture. God hid Jesus's
[30:11] resurrection in half of a verse
[30:14] and Satan didn't know it. Oh yeah. My
[30:17] wife said the audio's pretty quiet but
[30:19] better. Is it something one of the knobs
[30:20] that needs to be adjusted? Look for the
[30:23] knob.
[30:25] Look for the knob that says uh
[30:29] wireless mic. Maybe that's
[30:34] Sorry. We're trying to get a little bit
[30:35] of a internet connectivity and sound
[30:38] issue fixed here. Hopefully hopefully
[30:40] it'll be better here by God's grace.
[31:03] Just for uh your reference, the
[31:05] resurrection is here in chapter 16. And
[31:08] then remember, brother Ram said the
[31:09] rapture is in Psalm 27.
[31:12] So if you're just interested in those
[31:14] verses, those chapters in particular,
[31:16] very powerful verses.
[31:19] So the resurrection was in Psalm 16, the
[31:22] rapture was in Psalm 27. Think of that.
[31:24] David wrote about both of them. And
[31:26] David wrote about the cross. My
[31:27] goodness. So, David wrote about the
[31:29] cross, the resurrection, and the
[31:31] rapture. Why? Because he was a man after
[31:33] God's own heart. And he was, of course,
[31:35] a type of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[31:38] Let's read our verses for tonight. I
[31:40] want to preach on I have set the Lord
[31:41] always before my face. As we head into,
[31:43] as we start 2026 here,
[31:47] let's read eight and nine. Can we ready?
[31:49] One, two, three. I have set the Lord
[31:52] always before me. Because he is at my
[31:55] right hand, I shall not be moved.
[31:58] Therefore, my heart is glad and my glory
[32:02] rejoicth. My flesh also shall rest in
[32:05] hope. May God add his blessing to the
[32:07] read of his word. You can be seated.
[32:10] I do apologize. I thought it said he
[32:12] always set before my face, but I think
[32:14] that's the book of Acts scripture. So,
[32:16] we'll read that in just a little bit
[32:17] here by God's grace.
[32:20] But again, saints, if you remember here,
[32:22] uh,
[32:24] verse 10 is the resurrection verse,
[32:26] brother Chris. For thou wilt not leave
[32:29] my soul in hell,
[32:31] neither wilt th holy one, I'm sorry, ne,
[32:33] neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one
[32:36] to see corruption. So David had a
[32:38] revelation that all the believers, even
[32:40] if they're saved, they went to hell. But
[32:42] remember, there's a separation. There's
[32:43] a chasm between the believers and the
[32:46] sinners, right? And so the believers,
[32:49] although they were in the section of
[32:50] earth called hell, they were not in
[32:52] torment. They were in paradise,
[32:54] Abraham's bosom. So David had a
[32:57] revelation. He knew that when when the
[33:00] believers died, they went down. Now
[33:02] Chris and I were talking and Chris had a
[33:04] good thought. Uh remember the Bible said
[33:06] Elijah went up, right? So all the Old
[33:09] Testament saints that died, they went
[33:11] down. Elijah went up and that must mean
[33:13] Enoch went up. And brother Chris caught
[33:16] it. Remember I read that quote last week
[33:17] where Enoch saw Jesus remember in the in
[33:21] Abraham's bosom, but it seems like by
[33:23] scripture Enoch wasn't there.
[33:25] Hallelujah. Enoch would have went up to
[33:27] heaven, right? He would not have been in
[33:28] Abraham's bosom because he never died.
[33:31] So I thought that was good. Brother
[33:32] Chris caught that. That's a good catch
[33:33] there, brother Chris. Uh so thank you.
[33:38] Now again, so verse 10, David knew he
[33:41] would die and go down to hell, but he
[33:42] wouldn't be tormented. Um, and then
[33:46] neither wil thy holy one to see
[33:48] corruption. So corruption sets in after
[33:50] three days, brother Chris, the body will
[33:52] start corrupting after three days.
[33:55] So that's why Jesus had to be raised
[33:57] within three days and three nights
[33:59] because on the fourth day, it would
[34:01] start to corrupt, right? Because God
[34:03] said he's so holy. He he he'll pay the
[34:06] penalty for sin. All the sin will be
[34:08] placed on him, but he won't corrupt. And
[34:10] that shows he's the word of God. That
[34:12] shows the word of God doesn't corrupt as
[34:14] well. Hallelujah. Amen. Now, Jesus
[34:16] showed he had power over corruption
[34:18] though because Lazarus died and on the
[34:20] fourth day, Jesus rose him from the
[34:22] grave.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; So, God has power to raise anyone who's
[34:26] been dead. Of course, he will do that
[34:28] again. No matter how long they've been
[34:30] dead, God has the power to raise them up
[34:32] and bring their bodies back from
[34:33] corruption. Hallelujah.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; And make them incorruptible by a
[34:37] glorified body. But that's the verse uh
[34:40] saints where Jesus or God hid Jesus'
[34:43] resurrection in that one verse. Now I
[34:45] also want to read verse 11. Thou will
[34:47] show me the path of life. Now how many
[34:49] believe that's true for them too?
[34:51] &gt;&gt; If God showed David the path for his
[34:53] life, God will show it to you too.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And like brother Simon said,
[34:58] if you're not sure, just look back at
[35:00] where you've come from and see God all
[35:03] that he's done for you. Right? Then you
[35:05] get a good idea. If he's done this for
[35:07] me, well, I can see where he might take
[35:09] me. Hallelujah. And remember, church,
[35:11] there's there's numerous parts to the
[35:12] will of God. There's the sovereign will
[35:14] of God, which he decre declared or I'm
[35:16] sorry, de decreed before the foundation
[35:19] world. Then there's the known will of
[35:21] God. The known will of God is this right
[35:23] here, right? The sovereign will of God,
[35:25] we don't know. There's a known will of
[35:27] God. And then, Brother Chris, as we
[35:29] live, God makes known the progressive
[35:31] will of God,
[35:33] &gt;&gt; right? like go God with Abraham. God
[35:35] told him go uh he said move to uh
[35:38] Palestine, right? But then that's all he
[35:41] told him. So but then progressively God
[35:44] showed him well now you're going to have
[35:45] a now you're going to be the father of
[35:46] nations.
[35:48] But then but then after that now it's
[35:49] going to come through Sarah. Okay.
[35:52] Right. So his life was progressive
[35:56] revelation
[35:57] you know and that's how our lives are
[35:59] too. Up to this point we know what God
[36:01] has done. Right? But we still want to
[36:03] stay in the will of God. Uh especially
[36:05] for our gifts of the Holy Spirit and our
[36:08] physical location and our jobs and our
[36:10] relationships if we're not married. You
[36:12] know, uh we want to be open to God
[36:14] showing us all those things in the
[36:16] progressive will of God. Like I've told
[36:19] you before, you know, I don't know that
[36:20] I'll always be the pastor here. God
[36:21] could have a desire to send me somewhere
[36:23] else, right? And you don't know if
[36:25] you'll always be here. God might send
[36:27] you some other church by God's grace.
[36:29] That's called the progressive will of
[36:31] God, right? where God will make it known
[36:33] to you at some point in the future. Now,
[36:35] God knows all of that in his sovereign
[36:36] will, but he's got to reveal it to us
[36:39] here on earth. Hallelujah. All right.
[36:42] And I like this. He'll show you the path
[36:44] of life. And in his presence is the
[36:46] fullness of joy.
[36:48] Amen. If you want joy, church, just get
[36:50] in God's presence. Hallelujah. That's
[36:52] what the Bible says. You all and that
[36:55] that's why, you know, we want to
[36:56] experience God. That's why we want to be
[36:58] happy in church. That's why I danced, I
[36:59] think, on Sunday. I just felt so joyful
[37:01] like the blood of Jesus Christ, you
[37:03] know, uh all that it had done for me. I
[37:05] just had to I I had to dance and give
[37:07] God thanks because he showed me that
[37:08] revelation, Jose, about the water,
[37:10] blood, and the spirit. For 24 years, I
[37:12] wondered why did brother Brandham say
[37:14] that that the bride was born at the
[37:16] Calvary. Why did brother say that? And
[37:18] then I saw you have water and blood and
[37:20] there's a birth in every with every
[37:22] birth there's water and blood. And then
[37:24] 50 days later, then the spirit came.
[37:26] Water, blood, spirit. Every birth has a
[37:28] water, blood, spirit. Amen. So it just
[37:31] it was just overwhelming joy and I
[37:33] stayed happy for the first three days of
[37:35] the week. Now yesterday I got a little
[37:36] tired. But that happiness stayed with me
[37:38] for at least three days. I was like,
[37:39] "Oh, just what a great revelation. God
[37:41] let me see it." Uh I would say, you
[37:43] know, maybe it took me too long, but at
[37:45] least I got it by God's grace.
[37:47] Hallelujah.
[37:48] Now, uh if you got your Bible, go to
[37:50] Psalm 27. Just to remind you, when
[37:51] brother Random preached the rapture, it
[37:54] was December 4th, 1965. This was the
[37:56] chapter he read. It's the only time he
[37:59] ever did that because I looked it up.
[38:03] All right. Now, he starts off verse one,
[38:05] but um go down to verse five is his
[38:09] rapture verse. For in the time of
[38:12] trouble, what? Right before the
[38:14] tribulation period, right?
[38:16] He shall do what? Hide me in his Hey,
[38:19] there's another testimony that your life
[38:21] is hidden in Christ right there. Amen.
[38:23] There's another testimony. Not only are
[38:26] you physically hidden, I'm sorry,
[38:27] spiritually hidden in Christ, the
[38:29] rapture is a hiding as well. That's
[38:32] where you're physically hidden because
[38:34] he snatches his bride away. Hallelujah.
[38:36] Good to see you, sister. God bless you.
[38:37] Happy New Year. Hallelujah, Sister
[38:40] Beatress. Happy New Year. God bless you.
[38:43] Amen. So, that's the rapture verse. In
[38:46] the secret of his tabernacle shall he
[38:48] hide me. Look at that. Twice in the same
[38:49] verse, he says he's going to hide you.
[38:51] Church, we have nothing to fear. Amen.
[38:53] Brother Ram said, "If the bomb if the
[38:55] atomic bomb would have been dropped in
[38:56] the 50s, brother Ram, they were always
[38:57] worried about atomic drum or bombs."
[38:59] Right? Brother Ram said, "Don't worry
[39:01] about the atomic bomb. Before it even
[39:03] goes off, you'll already be in the
[39:04] presence of Jesus Christ." Amen. Because
[39:07] God will not pour out his wrath upon the
[39:09] believers, upon the righteous.
[39:11] Hallelujah.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Now, we don't believe that'll happen as
[39:14] far as uh we don't know the timing of
[39:16] it. We don't believe that the the bomb
[39:17] will right be the atomic bombs be right
[39:19] before the rapture. But brother Ram's
[39:21] making a point that the Bible says God
[39:23] will protect his people. He won't let
[39:25] them suffer with the wicked. Hallelujah.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; And he shall set me up on a rock. And
[39:31] who is that rock? That rock was Christ.
[39:34] Hallelujah. All right. That's not even
[39:36] part of my sermon. Okay. So, I just want
[39:38] to show you that. I just that struck me.
[39:39] I like, "Oh my goodness. David
[39:40] prophesied of the the crucifixion, the
[39:42] resurrection, and the rapture." Praise
[39:44] God. Hallelujah. A man after God's own
[39:47] heart. How many want to be a church
[39:49] after God's own heart?
[39:50] &gt;&gt; Now, remember church, I'm This shouldn't
[39:52] be too long here. Let me see. As far as
[39:54] my slides, I only got Well, I guess I
[39:57] got 43. Okay.
[39:59] I didn't think there was that many, but
[40:01] um
[40:02] I don't think it'll go that that slow.
[40:05] Hopefully here because I want to give
[40:06] room for a testimony. Did everybody
[40:08] bring a testimony tonight? Something God
[40:10] did good for you this year. And if
[40:13] nothing, just say, "Hey, I I got food on
[40:15] the table. I'm here in the church of
[40:17] God." Hallelujah. I'm still making it to
[40:18] church. Amen. I'm still praying. I'm
[40:20] still seeking God. God's giving me good
[40:22] health to come to the house of God. God
[40:24] always set I'm sorry. David always set
[40:26] God before him. So, I want to That's my
[40:29] message for the new year. Let's set God
[40:31] before us in everything we do. Because a
[40:34] brother, like I said, a brother from
[40:35] Germany texted me that quote. I'm like,
[40:36] "Oh, I haven't seen that for years,
[40:37] brother Jose." I'm like, "That's
[40:38] inspiring to me. I want to preach on
[40:40] that tonight." Now, Albert Barnes,
[40:42] Brother mentions him in the church age
[40:44] book that he was one of the greatest
[40:45] preachers
[40:47] uh and teachers and writers about the
[40:49] Bible. He said they it was during the
[40:51] man age
[40:53] which would have been the Sardisian
[40:54] church age and the Wesleyan Philadelphia
[40:56] church age. So this is his comments on
[41:01] uh David's verse by night as well as
[41:03] day. So God is set before you in the
[41:06] nighttime and the daytime. God's always
[41:08] before you in your private meditations
[41:11] as well in your public professions.
[41:14] Right? I have regarded myself always as
[41:17] in the presence of God. So that's what
[41:18] David's saying. I'm always in God's
[41:20] presence. That way I'm going to I like
[41:23] like like brother our brother said, you
[41:24] know, we'll act different if we knew God
[41:26] was around. So remember Simon said that.
[41:28] We always act different if if mercy
[41:30] followed me around all day or I let
[41:31] Malachi fall. I' I'd act a little
[41:34] different. But we want to live like God
[41:36] is always there. He said, I've I've
[41:39] endeavored always to feel that his eye
[41:41] was always upon me. This too is one of
[41:43] the certain characteristics of piety or
[41:45] being spiritual and that we can always
[41:47] feel that we're in the presence of God
[41:49] and we always act as if his eye were
[41:51] upon us. And then Acts 2:25 here's Yeah,
[41:54] this is Yeah, here's where I got my
[41:55] text. I got I forgot
[41:58] uh the uh Peter is quoting Acts 6, I'm
[42:01] sorry, Psalm 16 and he said he's he's
[42:04] quoting the verse that we read tonight
[42:06] in Acts 16. Sorry, sorry, Psalms 16.
[42:10] For David speaks concerning him, I
[42:13] foresaw the Lord always before my face,
[42:16] for he is on my right hand that I should
[42:18] not be moved. So David lived his life
[42:21] like he was always looking at God's
[42:24] face. God's always staring down at him.
[42:26] God's always watch him as a loving
[42:27] father would.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Okay, so that's where I got my text. I
[42:31] have set the Lord always before my face.
[42:34] So God is always that's why we read the
[42:36] word, right? Like I I heard I heard this
[42:38] preacher every year he does this. Every
[42:40] year he makes a video. I'm going to give
[42:41] you thus sayith the Lord prophecies for
[42:43] 2026. And he just started reading the
[42:46] Bible,
[42:47] right? He does it to troll all these
[42:50] false prophets. But it's so beautiful to
[42:52] think of that like we we want thus
[42:54] sayith the Lord for the the year, right?
[42:55] We just got to read our Bibles,
[42:57] &gt;&gt; right? God is going to bring the
[42:59] promises like he'll never leave you or
[43:01] forsake you in 2026. That's thus sayith
[43:03] the Lord,
[43:04] &gt;&gt; right? Not me as a prophet, but that's
[43:06] what the Bible says. That's the Bible
[43:08] giving us the word of the Lord.
[43:10] Hallelujah. I thought that's a beautiful
[43:13] idea. Now, uh for time sake, I'm not
[43:16] going to u read all that, but he says,
[43:18] "I shall not be moved." He says, "I
[43:20] shall be saved. I shall not be disturbed
[43:22] by fear. I shall be protected from my
[43:24] enemies." Hallelujah. This is confidence
[43:27] in God in the time of great calamities.
[43:30] And who feels that he is safe under the
[43:32] divine favor and protection. Now,
[43:34] church, this is a revelation, right?
[43:36] This is a revelation. To be in a very uh
[43:39] a very fearful spot and still know that
[43:42] God's watching you, that takes a
[43:44] revelation. Hallelujah. And that's what
[43:47] we want. We want to know that even when
[43:48] we're going through trials, God is right
[43:50] there with us. And not just with us,
[43:52] he's watching us. Hallelujah. Now, we
[43:55] don't want to presume that Jesus is with
[43:57] us. We want to set him before each one
[44:00] of us. Right? And now we're going to get
[44:03] to a quote from brother Brandham. Mary
[44:05] rather and Joseph thinking Jesus was
[44:07] with them. They were just perceiving
[44:09] that he was with them thinking it must
[44:11] just be all right. He's bound to be with
[44:13] us. But they were sadly mistaken he
[44:15] wasn't. Now this is speaking of the
[44:16] story when Jesus was 12 years old in
[44:18] Luke chapter 2. Remember that?
[44:20] &gt;&gt; And they went down to the feast of
[44:22] Pentecost with everybody in their
[44:23] community, right? They traveled in
[44:25] communities and they just left and they
[44:27] they just assumed, well Jesus with his
[44:29] cousins, he's with somebody. Maybe he's
[44:31] with the neighbors. And they all got on
[44:33] their camels or their whatever they had
[44:35] or they started walking away and a few
[44:37] days later they're like, "Anybody see
[44:39] Jesus?" No. They they they left without
[44:43] Jesus. Hallelujah. And so, Brother Ram's
[44:46] using this story. He said, "Some people
[44:48] do that. They go places and they don't
[44:51] remember to take Jesus with them."
[44:54] Hallelujah. That's why I like when
[44:56] brother Rod told me just pray for that
[44:57] car. And we drove that car today. that
[44:59] that really when you pray for your car
[45:01] or whatever you pray for before your
[45:04] school day or your work day, you pray
[45:05] before you go into work. That's setting
[45:07] the Lord before you.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; I thought that's a good lesson. Rod just
[45:11] I got a revelation of what Rod was
[45:12] telling me to do. He's basically telling
[45:14] me to do Psalm chapter 16 verse 8 and N.
[45:18] So many good peoples like that. Good
[45:20] people do that, brother Jess. Good
[45:22] people forget to pray. Yes.
[45:25] Good people forget to ask God if it's
[45:27] the will of God to do something. Yeah,
[45:29] we all do it, saints.
[45:32] They think, they see the hour
[45:33] approaching. They know something's
[45:34] fixing to happen. What do they do? They
[45:35] go join a church thinking he's with
[45:37] them. They shake hands with a preacher
[45:38] thinking that's all they have to do.
[45:39] He's with them. Confirmed or baptized a
[45:42] certain way. That's all they have to do,
[45:43] thinking Jesus with them. Brother,
[45:45] sister, just like Mary, Joseph of old.
[45:47] Real sincere people, yet they are
[45:49] mistaken.
[45:51] Now, I like this. Your life proves
[45:53] whether Jesus is with you or not. Isn't
[45:55] that beautiful?
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Your life shows whether he's occupied
[45:59] here or whether he still is in heavens
[46:01] or not, whatever you are. Amen. Aren't
[46:05] you glad, church? The works that I do
[46:06] shall ye do also. Hallelujah.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; But now remember the Bible said, "Not
[46:10] all prophesy, not all speak with
[46:12] tongues, not all have gifts of healing,
[46:14] but God works somehow in your life."
[46:16] Right?
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Like even brother Chris, I told him even
[46:19] catching that, brother Chris about
[46:20] Enoch, I didn't catch that, right? So
[46:23] there's something that's something about
[46:25] God, right? Maybe it's a gift of
[46:27] knowledge like we talked about. That's
[46:28] God in there, right? Because God because
[46:31] remember brother said Jesus will always
[46:32] correct the air.
[46:35] Every time Mary said something wrong,
[46:37] Jesus corrected her. Excuse me, woman.
[46:39] Right now he must have said it real
[46:41] kind. That's his mother, stepmother.
[46:44] Jesus corrects every error. Hallelujah.
[46:47] So, see, we just got to see what what
[46:49] did God equip us to do? What has God
[46:51] called us to do? And then stay right
[46:53] with that by God's grace. How could you
[46:56] have Christ in you and then the very
[46:57] spirit in you deny his word? And you
[46:59] take up a creed like the Trinity instead
[47:01] or hell's eternal.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; How could you have God, right? Uh yeah,
[47:08] I was thinking of something I forgot.
[47:13] It was related to the tape church I was
[47:14] thinking about. I can't I don't think of
[47:16] it right now.
[47:18] It can't do it. He said it can't do it.
[47:20] He would defeat himself by denying his
[47:21] own word just because somebody put a
[47:24] wrong interpretation to it. He says you
[47:26] got a Bible. You can read like anybody
[47:28] else. Be sincere. In other words, you
[47:30] don't have to take anybody's word for
[47:31] it. You get alone with God. You spend
[47:33] time with God and God will reveal the
[47:35] truth to you. In other words, don't make
[47:36] an excuse. Well, my pastor preached it
[47:38] wrong or this evangelist preached it
[47:40] wrong. No. No. So there's no excuses.
[47:42] You've got a you've got God to go to.
[47:44] You have communion with God. You can
[47:46] always set God before your face.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; See, we can't blame the preacher. We
[47:50] can't blame the song leader. Can't blame
[47:52] the deacon. You know, we can't blame
[47:54] other people, our mom or dad. We can't
[47:56] blame anybody because we can go to God's
[47:58] presence as well
[48:00] &gt;&gt; and we can have the fullness of joy.
[48:03] Amen. Hallelujah.
[48:06] But David said, so here here's the
[48:08] quote. And now he's preaching this in
[48:09] January 19th at the beginning of 1964
[48:12] the the shalom sermon.
[48:15] So brother Bam saying don't take
[48:17] somebody's word. David said put him
[48:19] always before your face. Know that when
[48:21] we are meeting this new year we're
[48:23] meeting it in the power of the
[48:25] resurrection of Christ. He's always
[48:27] before me. I shall not be moved.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Okay. So that's the quote that was
[48:31] shared with me that inspired this whole
[48:33] sermon. Just a brother from Germany said
[48:35] that to me. I'm like I like that. I want
[48:36] to start my year with that. I'm going to
[48:38] set the Lord before my sermons. I'm
[48:40] going to set the Lord before my song
[48:41] leading. I'm going to set the Lord
[48:42] before my I go back to school.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; Don't you want to do that? I want to set
[48:46] the Lord before I study, before I uh
[48:49] talk with my wife and my children, have
[48:50] the Bible time. I want the Lord always
[48:52] before me. I want Jesus in everything I
[48:54] do.
[48:57] I thought that was beautiful. Don't you?
[48:58] I thought a bless that man from Germany.
[49:00] Hallelujah. Now church, remember David
[49:03] spoke to God every morning and he loved
[49:05] to worship. So this is just a reminder
[49:08] about putting God first in the morning.
[49:09] I know I preach on it often, but where
[49:11] did I get this? I got it from David, a
[49:13] man after God's own heart. To the chief
[49:15] musician of uh Neahil, a psalm of David.
[49:20] Give ear to my words, oh Lord. Consider
[49:22] my meditation. God, consider how I'm
[49:24] thinking about you all the time. Hearken
[49:27] unto the voice of my cry, my king and my
[49:29] God. For unto thee will I pray. I'm not
[49:33] praying up. I'm not asking other people
[49:35] for help. God, I'm asking you for help.
[49:38] I'm not going to go other gods. I'm not
[49:40] going to false religions, the Hindu
[49:41] religion. I'm not running to the
[49:43] government for help. Lord, I'm coming to
[49:45] you for help.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; My voice shalt thou hear in the morning.
[49:49] Oh Lord, in the morning will I direct my
[49:51] prayer unto thee and will look up. That
[49:53] capital L O R D, remember, is Jehovah.
[49:55] Remember, brother Chris, that was the
[49:57] name that God gave to Moses. Remember we
[49:59] did that? talk about that Abraham didn't
[50:02] know him as Jehovah.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Remember I sent you that
[50:06] verse in Exodus? God said, "Moses,
[50:08] you're going to know me by a new name."
[50:09] There's progressive revelation right
[50:11] there, too. Amen. Jehovah, the
[50:13] self-existing one, the one who exists on
[50:16] his own, by himself. Hallelujah.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; David knew him as Jehovah. Of course,
[50:21] because David was after Moses.
[50:24] In the morning, I'll direct my prayer
[50:26] unto you, and I'll looked up to heaven.
[50:27] Hallelujah.
[50:30] Now, I I put that real small. I And I do
[50:34] apologize. I put that so small. Yeah.
[50:36] So, very sorry. I normally don't do
[50:38] that. I forgot to do that. I forgot to
[50:40] make them. I usually put three verses on
[50:41] a slide, so forgive me. I put double
[50:43] that. A Psalm of David. The Lord is my
[50:46] light and my salvation. Is God your
[50:48] light today, church?
[50:49] &gt;&gt; Whom shall I fear? So, that that's a
[50:51] verse we need reminded. We shouldn't
[50:53] have to fear because God's our light.
[50:54] God's our deliverance. The Lord is the
[50:57] strength of my life. Of whom shall I be
[50:59] afraid? In other words, why do I got to
[51:01] be afraid? God, I have life just because
[51:03] God gave it to me. God could gain my
[51:04] life. God can take my life. God gives
[51:07] and God takes away. So, what should I
[51:08] fear? Hallelujah.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; When the wicked, even my enemies and my
[51:12] foes come upon me to eat of my flesh.
[51:14] They stumbled and fell. Though in host
[51:16] should encamp against me, my heart shall
[51:19] not fear. The war should rise against
[51:21] me. In this will I be confident.
[51:25] One thing have I desired the Lord, that
[51:27] I will seek after, that I might dwell in
[51:29] the house of the Lord all the days of my
[51:31] life, to behold the beauty of the Lord,
[51:33] and to inquire in his temple. Church,
[51:36] don't you feel that way? There's one
[51:37] thing I want. I want to be with Jesus in
[51:39] heaven.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; A brother from uh Minnesota sent me
[51:42] another idea today. It was so I my my
[51:45] eyes started crying when I read it. He
[51:47] said, "Brother Jesse said, "My dad and
[51:49] I, we're so sick." He said, "We can't
[51:50] even physically go to church." He said,
[51:53] ' So I feel bad when you make these
[51:55] videos about, you know, Brandham
[51:56] Tabernac Tabernacle got go not going to
[51:58] church, right? They stop, they close
[52:00] their church doors. I said, 'Bro, don't
[52:02] feel bad. You're so sick. God knows if
[52:04] you had the health, you would go to
[52:05] church because you live stream our
[52:07] services." And he said, "Brother Jess, I
[52:09] feel really bad." He's like, "This is my
[52:11] one request for God." Listen, and I've
[52:13] never heard this before in all my years
[52:15] in the message, 20 25 24 years. He said,
[52:19] "I hope because I don't go to church
[52:21] because I'm sick." He said, 'I hope God
[52:23] will still take me in the rapture. He
[52:24] said, ' And I'll sit under the table of
[52:26] the marriage supper of the lamb under
[52:28] the tablecloth and God will just let me
[52:31] wash people's feet while you all are
[52:33] eating at the supper. And I started
[52:35] crying. I'm like, that's what I hope God
[52:37] lets me do. I hope I get I just get to
[52:40] go. Hallelujah. You know, you I don't
[52:43] consider myself something great. I JUST
[52:45] WANT TO GO TO HEAVEN. HALLELUJAH.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; I just want to be with Jesus. Whatever
[52:48] the lowest PLACE IS, I'LL ACCEPT THAT.
[52:51] HALLELUJAH. I JUST WANT TO BE THERE. I
[52:53] don't want to be with the wicked here in
[52:54] the tribulation period. I thought that
[52:56] was such a humble thing to say. And to
[52:58] me, based upon that humility, I don't
[53:00] think he'll be under the table. I think
[53:02] he'll be sitting at the table.
[53:03] Hallelujah.
[53:05] Because that's a real desire.
[53:06] Hallelujah.
[53:08] For in the time of trouble. Okay, now I
[53:09] read that. Yep, I read that. That's the
[53:11] rapture message. All right. So, I'm
[53:12] going to skip verse six for time sake.
[53:14] I'm not getting far on my 43 slides
[53:16] here. David went. Now, did you remember
[53:18] this about as I was studying this? I was
[53:19] like, that's right. And the Holy Spirit
[53:21] remembered this to me or reminded this
[53:23] to me.
[53:25] David always went before the army.
[53:29] So he led the army out and then he led
[53:32] the army back in.
[53:35] So church, because because he put God in
[53:37] front of him, he know he would only walk
[53:40] where God told him to walk. Hallelujah.
[53:45] And because he put God in front of him
[53:47] and everywhere he went, he knew God was
[53:48] leading him. That's why everybody wanted
[53:50] to follow him.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Now parents, that's what we want to be.
[53:54] We want to live so close to God.
[53:55] Grandparents and those those of us who
[53:57] are married, we want to live so close to
[53:59] God with our so our children can see,
[54:01] wow, we follow God so well. I want to be
[54:03] like mom and dad
[54:06] &gt;&gt; or grandma or grandpa.
[54:08] Hallelujah.
[54:10] So David went before the people because
[54:12] he placed God in front of himself.
[54:16] And this is why the people could follow
[54:18] David because he was following God.
[54:22] Amen.
[54:24] Remember this. This was right after,
[54:25] remember chapter 17 of 1st Samuel was da
[54:28] with David killing Goliath. And Saul was
[54:31] afraid of David because the Lord was
[54:32] with him and was departed from Saul.
[54:34] Therefore Saul removed him from him and
[54:36] made him his captain over a thousand.
[54:38] And he went out and came in before the
[54:40] people. And David behaved himself wisely
[54:43] in all his ways. And the Lord was with
[54:44] him. Now church, was he foolish in any
[54:46] of his ways? That means he was good with
[54:48] his money. He was good with his sexual
[54:51] desires.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Right? He was good with his language.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; In every way, David was wise. Why?
[54:58] Because God was always in front of him.
[55:00] He's like, I'm living in the presence.
[55:02] I'm living in the face of Yahweh
[55:05] Jehovah.
[55:08] And when Saul saw that he behaved
[55:10] himself wisely, very wisely, he was
[55:12] afraid of him. See, church, sinners will
[55:14] be afraid of you if you're a wise
[55:16] believer. Hallelujah.
[55:19] But all Israel and Judah, what did they
[55:21] do for David? They loved him. My because
[55:25] he went out and came in before him. Look
[55:27] at this man. He he he places God before
[55:30] him. He goes out. He gets the victory
[55:31] and he comes back with the spoils of
[55:33] victory.
[55:35] Hallelujah. All because he said, "God,
[55:38] I'm putting you before my face. I'm only
[55:42] gonna do God what you call me to do. And
[55:44] brother Ram says it like this. The bride
[55:47] does. The brother Ram says this, "The
[55:49] bride has thus sayeth the Lord or she
[55:51] stands still." How many remember that
[55:52] quote from the church age book? The
[55:55] bride won't move. In other words, we're
[55:56] trying to be a church that we only move
[55:58] when we have thus sayith the Lord. If I
[56:01] don't got thus say the Lord, let me wait
[56:03] on that. Hallelujah. But remember, God
[56:06] reveals so much in the word that we that
[56:08] we can that we can act upon. But on big
[56:11] moves like we talked about marriage or a
[56:13] new job or moving even to a new church,
[56:16] you want thus sayith the Lord on that so
[56:18] you know you're walking with God.
[56:21] Hallelujah.
[56:24] You see church people will love
[56:26] believers will love to follow you. Your
[56:28] children will love to follow you. Right?
[56:30] Uh your relatives will love to follow
[56:33] you if you're putting the Lord always
[56:35] before your face. Hallelujah.
[56:40] Now when after David is king in Hebron
[56:43] for seven years remember uh he becomes
[56:47] after that he becomes king of all Israel
[56:50] after that and here's chapter 5 in 2
[56:52] Samuel is where that happens and I want
[56:54] you to see what all the all the other 11
[56:56] tribes what do they say about David then
[56:59] came all the all the tribes of Israel to
[57:01] David unto Hebron and spake saying
[57:02] behold we are thy bone and thy flesh
[57:05] just like Jesus also in times past when
[57:08] Saul was king over us thou was he that
[57:10] led us out and brought us in Israel. And
[57:13] the Lord said to thee, thou shalt feed
[57:15] my people Israel, and thou shalt be a
[57:18] captain over Israel. Hallelujah. So when
[57:22] when all Israel finally comes to make
[57:24] David king, this is what they remember.
[57:27] David always let us out and David always
[57:30] brought us in.
[57:32] In other words, he was a leader. Now
[57:34] church, we want to be spiritual leaders
[57:36] in our homes and our schools.
[57:40] Hallelujah. You want to be a You want
[57:42] You want to lead I'll say like this. You
[57:43] want to lead your friends in prayer at
[57:44] lunchtime. You can do that, right? You
[57:48] can do that.
[57:50] So, think about how you can be a leader.
[57:53] How can you lead people
[57:55] to know God better? Maybe it's Bible
[57:58] studies, right?
[58:00] Maybe it's inviting people to church.
[58:01] Hallelujah. You're trying to lead the
[58:04] way and show them the way because God is
[58:08] showing you what to do, right? God is
[58:10] always before your face. And because God
[58:13] is always before you, you know what
[58:14] you're doing,
[58:16] &gt;&gt; right? Because you you didn't leave
[58:17] Jesus back there at your apartment. You
[58:19] didn't leave Jesus back there at your
[58:20] home. He's with you.
[58:23] In other words, you're under the
[58:24] anointing.
[58:26] All right? Now, remember church, I
[58:27] preached on this earlier this year.
[58:28] David inquired of the ark first. In
[58:31] other words, when he would go to the
[58:32] ark, that's like setting God before him.
[58:36] Now, there was at least four times he
[58:38] did that. He didn't know whether to
[58:39] fight the Philistines. So, God said, "Go
[58:42] up and fight him." And then he asked for
[58:44] confirmation. Well, God, I really got to
[58:46] make sure. God says, "Yes, go up and
[58:47] fight him."
[58:49] &gt;&gt; See, church, you see, you can ask God
[58:50] for a double confirmation.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; You can ask God for a double. Remember,
[58:54] in the mouth of what? Two or three
[58:56] witnesses, let every word be
[58:57] established.
[58:59] Okay? And then he said, he asked God, he
[59:02] asked the ark, "Will Saul come to Kela
[59:03] and take me?" God says, "Yes." So he
[59:05] didn't go. And then after Zix Ziglag's
[59:07] destruction, that was in the movie,
[59:09] right, girls? Was that in the movie
[59:10] Ziglag? The David movie? Yeah. Okay. So
[59:14] he in the movie, he should have went to
[59:16] the ark. And then uh God said, "Yes,
[59:20] pursue and recover all the families back
[59:22] and all the spoils." Right
[59:26] now, if you got your Bibles, let's do
[59:27] the malberry tree one. Remember this
[59:29] one. 2 Samuel 5:23.
[59:33] I want you to see how David always set
[59:35] the Lord before him. Now, not all I not
[59:37] always. I'm I'm being uh uh what's that
[59:40] word? I'm exaggerating. I'm using
[59:41] hyperbole. There it is. I'm
[59:42] exaggerating.
[59:44] He did I'll say like that. He did it
[59:45] very often. Not always because he didn't
[59:47] in the case of Basheba, Uriah numbering
[59:50] Israel. Remember all those iniquities
[59:52] that we showed?
[59:58] Now verse 23, 2 Samuel 5:23.
[1:00:03] Now the Philistines here had come. And
[1:00:05] when David inquired, Lord, he said,
[1:00:07] "Thou shalt not go up, but fetch a
[1:00:09] compass behind them and come upon them
[1:00:11] over against the malberry trees." So God
[1:00:14] says this time, "Don't go forward right
[1:00:16] into battle, but go behind them."
[1:00:20] See, this is why not every battle's the
[1:00:21] same, church. I'm talking about your
[1:00:24] battles, right? Every time you fight a
[1:00:27] spirit, it's not always going to be the
[1:00:28] same way to get the victory. Some
[1:00:30] sometimes God might have you get victory
[1:00:32] a different way. So now verse uh 23,
[1:00:38] but fetch a compass behind them and come
[1:00:40] upon them over against the malberry
[1:00:42] trees. And let it be when thou hearest
[1:00:44] the sound of a going in the tops of the
[1:00:46] malberry trees, that then thou shalt be
[1:00:49] stir thyself, that means move thyself.
[1:00:52] For then shall the Lord go out before
[1:00:54] thee to smite the host of the
[1:00:56] Philistines. And David did so, as the
[1:00:58] Lord commanded him, and smokeote the
[1:01:00] Philistines from Gea,
[1:01:02] and I'm sorry, until thou come to Gazer.
[1:01:06] Hallelujah. So from the land of Benjamin
[1:01:08] all the way to the land of Ephraim.
[1:01:11] Now church, do you understand this? This
[1:01:14] is David letting the Lord go before him.
[1:01:17] So, Brother Chris, they camped out by
[1:01:19] these trees and they're like, "Come on,
[1:01:21] David. Let's go." And David's like, "No,
[1:01:22] I'm waiting for the sound of the
[1:01:24] Malberry trees." In other words, I'm
[1:01:25] waiting for the wind of the Holy Spirit
[1:01:27] to blow through the church. Amen.
[1:01:29] Hallelujah. Praise God. See, God said,
[1:01:32] God said, "I'm going to go before you
[1:01:34] and I'm going to pass over like the wind
[1:01:35] of the Holy Spirit and you're going to
[1:01:37] hear the trees move and that's your
[1:01:39] signal. follow me. Amen. Set the Lord
[1:01:43] always before you. Hallelujah. Praise
[1:01:45] God.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; See that? But other times, he would just
[1:01:49] go right into battle. But this time, he
[1:01:50] said, "You got to do it a different way.
[1:01:52] You got to let me go before you and wait
[1:01:54] until you see God move." Now, church,
[1:01:57] that's what you got to do with your
[1:01:58] relationships. You got to wait till God
[1:02:00] opens up a relationship. Right? You
[1:02:02] don't rush into it. It's just like uh
[1:02:04] it's just like uh Rebecca, right? Right.
[1:02:08] What what did uh Elazar pray? Lord, have
[1:02:10] the woman who comes out with water and
[1:02:13] gives me water and the camel's water,
[1:02:15] have that be the woman. Go before me.
[1:02:18] Amen.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; See, he waited. He prayed and he asked
[1:02:23] God. And the Bible said the angel Lord
[1:02:25] went before Eleazar to prepare Rebecca's
[1:02:28] heart.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:32] How many enjoying the word so far? Have
[1:02:34] I have I lost anybody? I hope it's not
[1:02:36] too difficult here. This one's not very
[1:02:37] deep. Amen. which is good. We need some
[1:02:41] uh some easy to understand uh messages.
[1:02:44] Now, in every season of life in 2026
[1:02:47] brings set Jesus before you. Now,
[1:02:50] church, there's going to be a lot of
[1:02:52] things happen in 2026, just like last
[1:02:54] year. Now, you might have a year of rest
[1:02:57] this year, that would be wonderful where
[1:02:58] not many bad things happen like the
[1:03:00] Bible said. There's kings that had rest.
[1:03:03] Or it might be a battle or a year filled
[1:03:06] of lots of battles. We'll see how it
[1:03:08] goes, right? But we got to be ready. We
[1:03:10] got to set the Lord before us because
[1:03:12] remember, brother Chris, have you seen
[1:03:13] this? There's 14 different seasons that
[1:03:16] of life that you go through, okay? Uh
[1:03:19] Solomon wrote about it. To everything,
[1:03:21] there's a season to a time to every
[1:03:23] purpose under the heaven. There's a time
[1:03:25] to be born, a time to die. My uncle just
[1:03:28] passed away uh a couple days ago, so I'm
[1:03:30] going to his funeral on Saturday. He was
[1:03:32] 63 years old. Simon tried to witness to
[1:03:36] him. Um, but it was his time to pass.
[1:03:39] There's a time to plant and a time to
[1:03:41] pluck up that which is planted. A time
[1:03:43] to kill, a time to heal, a time to break
[1:03:45] down, a time to build up.
[1:03:48] A time to weep and there's a time to
[1:03:50] laugh. A time to mourn and there's a
[1:03:52] time to dance. I like that one. I had my
[1:03:56] dance time on Sunday. There's a time to
[1:03:58] cast away stones, but there's a time to
[1:04:00] gather up stones together. There's a
[1:04:02] time to embrace and a time to refrain
[1:04:04] from embracing. There's a time to get
[1:04:07] and then there's a time to lose.
[1:04:10] A time to keep and a time to cast away.
[1:04:13] There's a time to rend. There's a time
[1:04:15] to sew. There's a time to keep silence
[1:04:18] and there's a time to speak. There's a
[1:04:20] time to love and a time to hate. A time
[1:04:23] of war and a time of peace. What profit
[1:04:26] hath he that workketh in that wherein he
[1:04:28] labth? I have seen the travail which God
[1:04:31] given to the sons of men to be exercised
[1:04:33] in it. I love this. He hath made
[1:04:35] everything beautiful in his time.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Now church, can you look back? Hopefully
[1:04:39] you can look back at 2025 and said, "God
[1:04:42] made some of those things beautiful in
[1:04:44] his time. I went through trials, but God
[1:04:47] brought me through the trials.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; I didn't think I didn't think I'd make
[1:04:51] it through that one, but God brought me
[1:04:53] through it by God's grace." Amen.
[1:04:55] Hallelujah.
[1:04:57] He also has set the world in their heart
[1:04:59] so that no man can find out the work
[1:05:01] that God maketh from the beginning to
[1:05:03] the end. I know that there's no good in
[1:05:05] them, but for a man to rejoice and to do
[1:05:07] good in his life, and also that every
[1:05:10] man should eat and drink and enjoy the
[1:05:12] good of all his labor, it is the gift of
[1:05:14] God.
[1:05:16] And brother says this, brother said,
[1:05:18] "This verse proves the keystone of the
[1:05:20] Bible that God is unchanging and so are
[1:05:23] his ways." This is one of the verses
[1:05:25] along with Hebrews 13:8. I know that
[1:05:28] whatsoever God doeth, it shall be
[1:05:31] forever.
[1:05:32] Nothing can be put to it nor anything
[1:05:35] can be taken from it. In other words,
[1:05:36] God has a certain plan for your life and
[1:05:38] you can't change it. Let's just agree
[1:05:40] with God's plan for our lives.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; And God doeth it that men should fear
[1:05:46] before him. So what is God trying to do
[1:05:48] in your life? God's trying to get you to
[1:05:50] fear the Lord.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Remember the fear of the Lord series we
[1:05:53] preached on? The fear of the Lord is so
[1:05:55] important to fear God. A brother uh a
[1:05:58] brother from overseas emailed me
[1:05:59] yesterday. He's like, "I'm having
[1:06:01] trouble overcoming porn. What should I
[1:06:03] do?" I said, "Brother, fear the Lord.
[1:06:06] Fear God." Because when you fear God,
[1:06:10] you'll hate evil. And the Bible said
[1:06:12] you'll depart from evil.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; See, he thinks God is just playing
[1:06:15] around up there in heaven and and think
[1:06:17] you God's going to let you get away with
[1:06:19] that. God won't let you get away with
[1:06:20] that.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Anything you do, you'll suffer for and
[1:06:24] pay for it. That's right. But you can
[1:06:26] still be a child of God if you repent.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Right. David's the example, right, with
[1:06:31] adultery and murder.
[1:06:35] So God wants us to fear the Lord. Now, I
[1:06:37] want you to think just for a moment.
[1:06:38] Think about some of the sermons God set
[1:06:40] before us in 2025.
[1:06:43] I went through church. I preached 21
[1:06:45] sermons on Corinthians. Eight on the
[1:06:47] spirit of burning.
[1:06:49] Six on angels. Five on we wrestle not
[1:06:52] against flesh and blood. Five on the
[1:06:54] masterpiece. Four on God hiding himself
[1:06:56] in simplicity. Three on we have thus
[1:06:58] sayaith the Lord. Three on a prophet's
[1:07:00] love for the word of God. Three on
[1:07:02] David's battle against iniquity. Three
[1:07:03] on the Lord's awakened or the Lord
[1:07:05] awakened in David's generation. Two on
[1:07:07] Job heard but then he saw the Lord. Two
[1:07:09] on the home church. And two on what is
[1:07:11] blasphemy of the Holy Ghost. and then 20
[1:07:13] other single sermons.
[1:07:16] Hallelujah. So these are some of the
[1:07:18] scriptures God gave us to prepare us for
[1:07:21] 2025. And look, you made it through.
[1:07:24] Amen. Hallelujah. Also preached on the
[1:07:26] VA United States and uh we just looked
[1:07:29] at the uh uh we looked at the water in
[1:07:32] the blood. Hallelujah.
[1:07:34] All these uh different there there's 20
[1:07:36] others that preach that I felt led to
[1:07:38] preach and I trust they strengthen you.
[1:07:40] Hallelujah. I I trust that you were able
[1:07:42] to overcome and wrestle against Satan
[1:07:44] and get the victory. Hallelujah.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:48] So I wonder what God will give us for
[1:07:50] 2026.
[1:07:51] Now brother Ram said you might backslide
[1:07:53] but your life is hid in Christ.
[1:07:56] Hallelujah. And brother Ram now brother
[1:07:58] Ram says this. You backslide in your
[1:08:00] thinking every day.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Right? That's why the Bible said
[1:08:03] transform your mind every single day.
[1:08:06] How am I doing on time now? Okay.
[1:08:09] Oh 30 minutes. Okay. Let me set a timer.
[1:08:11] I don't want to be about an hour because
[1:08:12] I want to hear the saints and their
[1:08:13] testimonies.
[1:08:15] I love this quote. Brother Simon used
[1:08:17] this quote and I think brother Cam used
[1:08:19] a quote last time they were here. Now
[1:08:21] you say, "Well, can't we backslide?"
[1:08:23] Absolutely. And when you back backslide,
[1:08:25] look what he says. You're going to get
[1:08:26] it. Don't worry. In other words, you're
[1:08:28] going to get spanked.
[1:08:30] When you backslide, right? When you make
[1:08:32] us a sin like iniquity, you knew you
[1:08:34] should not have did it, but you did it
[1:08:35] anyway. You're going to get it.
[1:08:39] Abraham got it
[1:08:41] and the rest of them got it and you'll
[1:08:42] get it. Don't Don't you think it gives
[1:08:44] you a right to sin? It doesn't. You'll
[1:08:46] pay for everything that you do. In other
[1:08:48] words, you'll suffer, right? Or you'll
[1:08:50] be afflicted. I'm going to preach a
[1:08:52] sermon on that. Many are the afflictions
[1:08:54] of the righteous, but the Lord deliverth
[1:08:56] him out of them all. Hallelujah. You'll
[1:09:00] reap what you sow. You do one little sin
[1:09:02] and you'll reap a whole wash tub full.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:07] That's exactly right. Because most time
[1:09:08] it's iniquity. Most time we know better.
[1:09:11] That's right. But brother, that don't
[1:09:13] mean to say you're lost. That's exactly
[1:09:15] right. Abraham reaped exactly what he
[1:09:16] sowed. That's right. But he was still
[1:09:18] saved.
[1:09:20] Hallelujah. The covenant that God made
[1:09:22] with Israel, they lost their inheritage.
[1:09:24] They lost the promised land and went
[1:09:26] down into Egypt. But they hadn't lost
[1:09:29] their covenant.
[1:09:31] Amen. God said, "I remember my promise
[1:09:33] to Abraham. I remember I've come down to
[1:09:36] deliver my people. Go down there." Moses
[1:09:38] and tell Pharaoh I said let my people go
[1:09:40] I remember I made a promise to Abraham
[1:09:42] and to his seed that's the same thing
[1:09:44] let's all say same thing ready same
[1:09:46] thing it is with us so if you are dead
[1:09:49] and your life is hidden God through
[1:09:51] Christ there's not nothing in the world
[1:09:53] can touch you in other words you can't
[1:09:54] be lost
[1:09:56] now you might go and do wrong but if
[1:09:58] you're really truly a child of God and
[1:10:00] you see you made a mistake you'll rise
[1:10:03] and try again
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; that's right and you'll not lay there.
[1:10:10] Hallelujah. And brother, I forgot to add
[1:10:12] this quote. Brother Ram said, "I like a
[1:10:13] man who gets up and goes at it." See, we
[1:10:16] don't want to lay down and get
[1:10:18] discouraged and depressed and and all
[1:10:20] these things. We want to get up and do
[1:10:21] the will of God, don't we?
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Don't lay there. If you made a mistake,
[1:10:25] get up and make make the mistake, right?
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Confess your sin to whoever you have to
[1:10:30] confess it to or confess it to God. Get
[1:10:32] up, get in prayer, get in the Bible, go
[1:10:34] listen to sermon, go do something. Get
[1:10:36] up and change your atmosphere.
[1:10:38] Hallelujah.
[1:10:39] Put the Lord before your face. Now
[1:10:42] church, the sad part is sometimes we let
[1:10:44] Satan say before our face, "Oh, look
[1:10:46] what you did. Look what you did. Oh, you
[1:10:48] you should be ashamed of yourselves.
[1:10:50] You'll never be forgiven. God can never
[1:10:51] forgive you. You should take his face
[1:10:53] and cast it down." Amen. Right. AND PUT
[1:10:56] THE LORD BEFORE your face. Hallelujah.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says. Bible said,
[1:11:01] "Cast out anything that exalts itself
[1:11:04] against the word of God.
[1:11:06] So, I love that quote. You're going to
[1:11:08] pay for everything you do, but that
[1:11:10] doesn't mean you're lost.
[1:11:12] Now, Chris and I read this this week at
[1:11:14] Bible study or last week. David reaped
[1:11:17] what he sowed.
[1:11:19] Remember, because of what David did with
[1:11:22] Basheba,
[1:11:23] he had four sons that died because he
[1:11:27] said the man that took that the rich man
[1:11:29] that took the poor man's lamb, he'll
[1:11:31] restore him fourfold. Four lambs. And so
[1:11:35] because David judged that, God took four
[1:11:37] of his sons.
[1:11:41] And what did, and this is so beautiful.
[1:11:42] Somebody used this the other day and I
[1:11:43] like I was like, "Oh man, this is
[1:11:44] perfect. Judge not that you be not
[1:11:46] judged. For with what judgment you
[1:11:48] judge, you shall be judged." Now church,
[1:11:50] we better be careful.
[1:11:54] The exact way David judged himself,
[1:11:57] that's what God did to him.
[1:12:00] That's why I don't want to judge these
[1:12:01] tape worshippers too harshly. I want to
[1:12:03] say, well, maybe I don't see how they
[1:12:05] can have the Holy Ghost, but hopefully
[1:12:06] they can be saved and hopefully they'll
[1:12:08] repent of their idolatry.
[1:12:10] But see, if I was if I was just letting
[1:12:12] anything fly with my words and just
[1:12:14] condemning all these things, the very
[1:12:17] way I judge them, that's how God would
[1:12:19] judge me if I did something similar.
[1:12:22] That's why the Bible said this next
[1:12:25] verse,
[1:12:26] blessed are the what? Merciful,
[1:12:29] for they shall obtain mercy.
[1:12:33] The church said,
[1:12:35] "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst
[1:12:37] after the righteous, they shall be
[1:12:38] filled." We got to hunger more to know
[1:12:40] God, to know the word.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Blessed are the pure in
[1:12:44] heart, for they shall see God. Now,
[1:12:47] David was this too. David was pure
[1:12:48] because as soon as Nathan told him, he
[1:12:50] repented.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; He went to the temple. He laid on his
[1:12:54] face. Remember, all the servants like,
[1:12:56] "What's he going to do if he's laying
[1:12:57] like that? What's it going to happen
[1:12:58] when he when the boy dies, right?"
[1:13:00] Right? But he got up and changed his
[1:13:02] clothes and worshiped.
[1:13:04] See? So church, however you judge
[1:13:07] others, that's how God's going to judge
[1:13:08] you. So let's be merciful to others.
[1:13:12] Right
[1:13:15] now, this is the one I read with brother
[1:13:17] uh Chris at Bible study. Remember last
[1:13:18] Friday, brother Chris? Now, this this
[1:13:21] was fresh to me. I' I'd forgotten about
[1:13:23] this. When this is when Abselon took
[1:13:26] over the kingdom. Now, church, Abselon
[1:13:27] was a wicked man. He slept with 10
[1:13:29] concubines of his dad's. What kind of
[1:13:32] spirit do you have to do or to have to
[1:13:35] do that? And then remember a hyhel was
[1:13:38] trying to tell him, you know, you should
[1:13:39] kill or no, yeah, you you should kill
[1:13:41] your dad. And Abselon agreed. He wanted
[1:13:44] his dad to be killed,
[1:13:47] right? And then remember he he let his
[1:13:48] hair grow too long. It was so handsome
[1:13:50] and thick. That was what caught him in
[1:13:52] the tree branch. Just like Satan. So
[1:13:54] beautiful, so handsome, right? that that
[1:13:57] pride the pride of being so beautiful
[1:13:59] and handsome and all these things it
[1:14:01] actually led to his death. Remember Joab
[1:14:03] took two arrows and stuck struck him
[1:14:05] through his heart.
[1:14:08] But I forgot about this. When David had
[1:14:11] left Jerusalem,
[1:14:13] a man came out of the house of Saul who
[1:14:15] was Shim Shimi. I'll just say Shemi, the
[1:14:18] son of Gir. And he co came forth and
[1:14:20] cursed still as he came. Now look at
[1:14:22] this church. He cast stones at David.
[1:14:24] Stones. He's throwing stones at David
[1:14:27] and at all the servants of King David
[1:14:29] and all the people and all the mighty
[1:14:30] men were on his right hand on his left.
[1:14:32] And thus said Shmiah when he cursed,
[1:14:34] "Come out, come out, thou bloody man,
[1:14:36] thou man of the devil." Bel Bile. Now
[1:14:39] look what he's doing. He's cursing him
[1:14:42] in the name of Bile. Like you're a
[1:14:44] devil.
[1:14:47] And he says, "The Lord hath returned
[1:14:48] upon thee all the blood of the house of
[1:14:50] Saul, in whosestead thouast reigned. And
[1:14:52] the Lord had delivered the kingdom into
[1:14:53] the hand of Abselon thy son. And behold,
[1:14:56] thou art taken in thy mischief because
[1:14:58] thou art a bloody man. In other words,
[1:15:01] you're reaping what you sowed.
[1:15:04] And he's throwing physical rocks at him.
[1:15:06] Right
[1:15:08] now, I I left out the verse. One of the
[1:15:10] mighty men comes up and says, "David,
[1:15:12] let me go take that head off of that
[1:15:13] dead dog."
[1:15:15] Right? He's cursing you. He's cursing
[1:15:17] us. Let me go take his head off. What
[1:15:19] does David say? He says, "What have I to
[1:15:21] do with you, you sons of Zariah? So let
[1:15:23] him curse because the Lord has said to
[1:15:25] him curse David." What?
[1:15:29] God
[1:15:31] church believers can be under temporary
[1:15:34] curses, but not eternal. Right?
[1:15:39] And what I mean by is eternal, eternal
[1:15:40] separation from God. Yes, the sinners
[1:15:42] will eventually cease to exist, but
[1:15:44] they're still separated from God for
[1:15:46] eternity. whatever they whatever they're
[1:15:48] annihilated to, right? Because the Bible
[1:15:51] says they're under eternal judgment.
[1:15:53] That judgment will last eternally.
[1:15:56] Look, he said the Lord told him, "Well,
[1:15:58] then who shall say, wherefore hast thou
[1:16:00] done so?" And David said to Abishai and
[1:16:02] all his servants, "Behold, my son, which
[1:16:03] came forth of my bow, seeketh my life,
[1:16:05] how much more now may this Benjamin do
[1:16:08] it?" Let him alone and let him curse.
[1:16:09] The Lord hath been him. God told him to
[1:16:12] do that.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Yes. Cuz like brother Ram said, if you
[1:16:15] make a sin, Brother Ram said, you'll pay
[1:16:17] for every bit of it.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; He said, you do one sin, he said you'll
[1:16:21] get a wash tub full or a bathtub full of
[1:16:24] consequences.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; See, church, that's why you keep your
[1:16:27] body pure sexually. Keep your words
[1:16:31] merciful.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Right? Whatever Whatever uh whatever the
[1:16:37] That's why you don't go after riches and
[1:16:39] try to get rich and sell out the church
[1:16:41] just to get rich. Whatever you sow,
[1:16:43] that's what you're gonna reap.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Now look, now look, even in this, David
[1:16:50] saw God's mercy. Oh church, let's let's
[1:16:52] thank God for his mercy tonight. Praise
[1:16:54] God. Even though he knew God was cursing
[1:16:56] him and that these people were going to
[1:16:58] die, it may be that the Lord will look
[1:17:00] upon my affliction and that the Lord
[1:17:02] will requite me good for his cursing
[1:17:04] this day. So in other words, God might
[1:17:07] turn this curse into a blessing.
[1:17:10] And God did. God turned this into a
[1:17:12] blessing, right? Because it wasn't long
[1:17:15] till David, he's crying, leaving
[1:17:17] Jerusalem, but it isn't long till he
[1:17:18] gets to go back and the people receive
[1:17:20] him back.
[1:17:22] So God turned this cursing, God turned
[1:17:24] the trial into a blessing.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; But did he still get stones thrown at
[1:17:29] him, Eden?
[1:17:31] Imagine stones like, "Oh, no, don't hit
[1:17:34] me."
[1:17:36] And then he's cursing him and say,
[1:17:37] "You're a child of the devil. You're a
[1:17:39] child of Bile." And David was like, "God
[1:17:41] told him to do that." God's reminding
[1:17:44] him, "Your sins have consequences."
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:50] That striking. It struck me, Brother
[1:17:52] Chris. Yeah.
[1:18:00] Yeah. Yeah. He Yeah. He had removed from
[1:18:03] Jerusalem. Yeah. He left Jerusalem. So,
[1:18:05] he was kicked out of the Well, he
[1:18:06] actually forfeited his uh palace,
[1:18:09] right? Right. And then his four sons
[1:18:11] died. Uh there was other things that
[1:18:13] took Oh, yeah. His Yeah. his 10 his 10
[1:18:15] concubines. He left them there to just
[1:18:17] clean the house and keep the palace, but
[1:18:20] then he had to put them away and then he
[1:18:22] could never know them anymore. So he
[1:18:23] lost basically lost 10 wives.
[1:18:28] All right. Now, so but even in this he
[1:18:31] said it maybe right and and that's what
[1:18:34] remember David said it may be that God
[1:18:37] will heal the child from Basheba.
[1:18:39] remember that.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; So look, he always believed in grace.
[1:18:42] God help us to believe in grace.
[1:18:44] Hallelujah. THERE'S A CHANCE GOD COULD
[1:18:46] SHOW ME GRACE. HALLELUJAH.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Verse 13. And as David and his
[1:18:52] men went up by the way, Shmai went along
[1:18:54] the hillside over against him and cursed
[1:18:55] as he went and threw stones at him and
[1:18:57] cast dust. Imagine you're walking along
[1:18:59] and you're getting dust all over you and
[1:19:01] getting hit with rocks like, "Oh man,
[1:19:04] all because of your sin. you. In other
[1:19:07] words, I deserve this. David could have
[1:19:09] said, "I deserve stones at me. I I
[1:19:12] deserve cursing. I deserve all this
[1:19:14] because I committed adultery and I
[1:19:15] murdered.
[1:19:17] I deserve this."
[1:19:20] And he said, "But maybe God can turn it
[1:19:22] around for a blessing." My goodness.
[1:19:25] Hallelujah. Oh yeah. Then the church,
[1:19:27] look at this. It's not long and the king
[1:19:29] and all the people that were with him
[1:19:30] came weary and refreshed themselves
[1:19:32] there. So right after this they get
[1:19:34] refreshed and they get encouraged.
[1:19:37] It's it's so hard to understand, right?
[1:19:39] God will bring all the cursing reminding
[1:19:42] them, look what you did. Don't forget
[1:19:43] what you did. But then God will refresh
[1:19:45] them and say keep keep pressing the
[1:19:47] battles.
[1:19:49] Hallelujah. God knows how to encourage
[1:19:51] his servants. Hallelujah.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; He knows how to humble them and he knows
[1:19:54] how to encourage them. And remember in
[1:19:57] the New Testament, remember there are
[1:19:58] curses. Remember we saw that in
[1:19:59] communion in 1 Corinthians 11. Many are
[1:20:01] weak, sick, and dead because they didn't
[1:20:04] rightly divide the body of Christ.
[1:20:07] Right? So, we know that that that curse,
[1:20:10] that temporary curse, that's Old
[1:20:11] Testament and that's New Testament.
[1:20:17] I'm almost uh see am I almost done? I'm
[1:20:20] at 30. Yeah, I'm almost done. Okay. Yes.
[1:20:22] Okay. Yeah, I'm almost done. Now, I'm
[1:20:24] closing with this thought. It's about
[1:20:25] seven slides, so bear with me here.
[1:20:27] Brother Ram says, "If you went somewhere
[1:20:30] without Jesus," other words, you didn't
[1:20:31] set Jesus before your face, he said, "Go
[1:20:34] back where you left him."
[1:20:36] Oh, God help us. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:20:38] Hallelujah. Praise God. Now, there's
[1:20:41] three examples. Joseph and Mary, right?
[1:20:44] They go back to Jerusalem to find Jesus
[1:20:46] because they left without Jesus.
[1:20:47] Brother, there's one in uh Brother
[1:20:48] Chris. There's one in uh Abraham. When
[1:20:51] the famine came in, the promised land,
[1:20:53] Abraham left, right? He left the
[1:20:56] promised land, went down to Egypt. But
[1:20:58] the Bible says when he come back, he
[1:21:00] come right back to the same altar that
[1:21:02] he left. So this shows when you leave
[1:21:05] God, you got to come back right where
[1:21:07] you left him.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; In other words, you got to remember what
[1:21:10] sin did I commit where I fell away from
[1:21:12] God.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah, brother.
[1:21:18] Yes.
[1:21:23] Exactly right. Yeah. Give them two
[1:21:24] claps. That's right. So I was thinking
[1:21:25] brother Austin too. Now remember my
[1:21:27] testimony. Remember in fifth grade I
[1:21:29] left God through worldly music. And
[1:21:32] where did God bring me back? Through
[1:21:34] Cam's car. I was listening to Christian
[1:21:35] music. So I had to come back where I
[1:21:38] left God. I left God when I was uh 11
[1:21:41] years old. And I come back when I was
[1:21:43] 19. And God brought me back the same way
[1:21:46] I left music.
[1:21:48] Music started changing my heart. I
[1:21:50] remember I started listening to that
[1:21:51] song. One of these days I'm going to see
[1:21:52] the hands that took the nails from me.
[1:21:54] Hallelujah. And that's a song that
[1:21:56] started breaking my heart down. Like,
[1:21:58] maybe I should be a Christian like Cam.
[1:22:00] Maybe this music is pretty pretty nice.
[1:22:03] I mean, listen to that rock and roll and
[1:22:04] AC/DC all those years, you know, and all
[1:22:06] the rap music and nonsense. When I heard
[1:22:08] this sweet music, it brought tears to my
[1:22:10] eyes. One of these days, I'm going to
[1:22:12] see the hands that took the nails from
[1:22:14] me. That softened my heart.
[1:22:18] Now, the other example is beautiful.
[1:22:20] Peter left Jesus on the night he was
[1:22:22] arrested. He was at a fire and he said,
[1:22:23] "I don't know Jesus. I don't know
[1:22:25] Jesus." Right? But how did Peter How did
[1:22:28] Peter make that right? He had to come
[1:22:29] back to the fire there at the Sea of
[1:22:32] Galilee after the resurrection.
[1:22:34] Right? And Jesus appears and uh they
[1:22:37] say, "Are Jesus, if this is you, let's
[1:22:40] eat some uh eat some bread and some
[1:22:41] fish." And they cook some fish and they
[1:22:44] give it to him. And Jesus asks him,
[1:22:45] "Peter, do you love me?" Where did he
[1:22:48] ask him that? Right by a fire.
[1:22:51] So the same place he Peter left Jesus at
[1:22:53] a fire is the same place he had to come
[1:22:55] back to to make it right. So brother
[1:22:58] that works for you Akan. Come back to
[1:22:59] Akan. That works for Austin. For me it's
[1:23:01] come back through the music. That's
[1:23:04] where I left God. Hallelujah. And
[1:23:07] church. Now what do we do now? Now what
[1:23:08] do you do now? You always set Jesus
[1:23:10] before you go driving for Uber,
[1:23:13] right? Before I go back to the school,
[1:23:15] I'm going to set Jesus before my face
[1:23:18] because I don't want to leave him
[1:23:19] behind. I want him to go with me.
[1:23:23] I always set the Lord I want to always
[1:23:26] set the Lord before my face.
[1:23:30] Now this I'm closing with this. This is
[1:23:32] the last quote. It's about six slides
[1:23:33] here. Now you find out that's what
[1:23:35] happens. But there's only one real way
[1:23:37] to find Jesus. Then if she Mary couldn't
[1:23:41] find him among the kin folk, she went
[1:23:42] back to where she left him, Jerusalem.
[1:23:46] Now here's a nice story. I think you
[1:23:47] might like this one.
[1:23:49] Reminds me of a chaplain sometime at the
[1:23:51] Second World War, so World War II. He
[1:23:53] was telling me that he was machined. He
[1:23:55] went to a man that was a machine gunned
[1:23:58] and they told him he was dying. He'd
[1:23:59] been shot through the chest with a
[1:24:00] machine gun, many bullets. And he said,
[1:24:02] "The man's dying." And the chaplain went
[1:24:04] to him to see him. And he was a
[1:24:06] chaplain. And he walked in the tent and
[1:24:07] said, "Chaplap, are you a Christian?"
[1:24:09] I'm sorry, captain. Are you a Christian?
[1:24:11] He said, "Well, I once was a Christian."
[1:24:13] He said, "Then what happened?" Now
[1:24:14] remember, this man's full of bullets and
[1:24:16] he's dying. And the chaplain says, "What
[1:24:19] do you mean? What happened?" "I just
[1:24:21] don't remember how it started." And he
[1:24:22] looked at his chart and he seen he was
[1:24:24] given about three to five minutes to
[1:24:25] live. So the captain knows I'm dying.
[1:24:29] And the good part of that time was
[1:24:31] already spent. How little do we know?
[1:24:34] But a lot of our time's already spent,
[1:24:36] too.
[1:24:37] Hallelujah. And the chaplain said to the
[1:24:40] captain, he said, "Captain, where did
[1:24:41] you leave him at?" And he said, "I just
[1:24:43] can't remember right now." So look at
[1:24:45] this. He's like, "You were a Christian,
[1:24:46] but you're not anymore. Where'd you
[1:24:48] leave him?"
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; See, but if he was a believer, Jesus
[1:24:52] would have been right with him right
[1:24:53] there.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "You better hurry up. You
[1:24:58] haven't got much time to get back down
[1:24:59] the road to where you left him." He
[1:25:00] said, "Everywhere you left him, then go
[1:25:03] right there and begin and you'll find
[1:25:05] him."
[1:25:06] And the chaplain said that he waited a
[1:25:08] few moments with the Bible in his hand
[1:25:10] to hear what the captain would say. And
[1:25:11] he kept thinking and thinking and his
[1:25:13] struggles as the blood was filling up in
[1:25:15] his lungs. And after a while a great
[1:25:17] smile come on his face and tears rolled
[1:25:19] down his cheeks. He said, "Oh, I
[1:25:20] remember." He said, "Start there,
[1:25:23] captain. Quickly."
[1:25:25] And the captain said, "Now I lay me down
[1:25:27] to sleep." He's, this is his prayer as a
[1:25:30] child. I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
[1:25:34] And if I should die before I wake, I
[1:25:36] pray the Lord my soul to take. He turned
[1:25:38] his head and was gone. Hallelujah.
[1:25:43] Sound familiar? Like the thief on the
[1:25:45] cross. Remember me when you come into
[1:25:47] your kingdom.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Lord, if I die, you keep my soul. I
[1:25:51] don't want to go to hell. Lord, you keep
[1:25:53] my soul.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:57] And where did he find him? In his high
[1:25:58] school experience, in his training of
[1:26:00] psychology and man, in his creed, in his
[1:26:02] church? No. Where he had Where did he
[1:26:04] find him? At the cradle. In other words,
[1:26:06] when he was a little baby or I'm sorry,
[1:26:08] a young child, that's where he left him
[1:26:11] and that's where Jesus was waiting for
[1:26:13] him. In other words, you got to go back
[1:26:16] in your mind. When did I uh what was the
[1:26:18] root? What was the start of my sin?
[1:26:20] Where did I leave Jesus? I got to go
[1:26:23] back there. Maybe it's when I took a
[1:26:25] puff of the cigarette, right? Or maybe
[1:26:27] it's when I clicked on that website I
[1:26:29] should not have clicked on. Or maybe
[1:26:31] it's when I lost my anger and I sent
[1:26:32] this evil word to my friend or my
[1:26:34] coworker and that was weeks ago, that
[1:26:37] was months ago, that was years ago.
[1:26:39] Wherever you left him, you got to go
[1:26:41] back there and confess your sin and make
[1:26:43] it right with God.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:47] Yes, brother.
[1:27:00] Right. There there might not have been a
[1:27:01] leaving. Yes. So here's a man who is a
[1:27:03] backslidance. This story is about
[1:27:04] backsliding. Good brother. Great
[1:27:06] question. Give it to Glad. That's a
[1:27:07] great question, brother. Good question.
[1:27:09] Yes. Very good.
[1:27:12] Yep. Because remember, brother, this is
[1:27:13] a story about backsliding.
[1:27:15] He says, "We'll never find Jesus by
[1:27:17] going back to the beginning of
[1:27:18] Baptistism,
[1:27:19] back to the beginning of Methodistism or
[1:27:22] Catholicism. will only find Jesus when
[1:27:24] you go back to Pentecost.
[1:27:27] Amen. The beginning, not the
[1:27:29] denomination now, but the real
[1:27:31] Pentecostal experience. How many had it?
[1:27:32] Praise God.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory. He said, "But we left him
[1:27:37] at Pentecost. The Methodists left him at
[1:27:38] Pentecost. The Baptist left him at
[1:27:40] Pentecost. The Catholic left him at
[1:27:42] Pentecost. The Amish, I gota share this
[1:27:43] with my Amish brothers. The Amish left
[1:27:45] him at Pentecost. The brother left him
[1:27:47] at Pentecost. I'm sorry. The Assemblies
[1:27:49] of God, where I was raised, left him at
[1:27:51] Pentecost. The United Church left him at
[1:27:53] Pentecost. I'll say like this. Some of
[1:27:55] the message churches left him at
[1:27:56] Pentecost.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. That's right,
[1:27:59] saints.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; That's where he began. Oh, God, help us
[1:28:04] to drive this home to every heart. It's
[1:28:07] my last This is my last quote here. We
[1:28:10] cannot find him in our creeds. Now, we
[1:28:12] know this. We cannot find him in our
[1:28:14] denominations. We've got to find him
[1:28:15] back where we left him. You say, "Well,
[1:28:17] Brother Ram, I tell you what I've done.
[1:28:18] I've danced in the spirit. I know I've
[1:28:20] got it." But Abraham said, "It wasn't so
[1:28:22] from the beginning." In other words,
[1:28:23] dancing isn't proof you're saved.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Anybody can dance,
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; right? Well, I spoke with tongues, so I
[1:28:31] know I've got it. It wasn't so from the
[1:28:32] beginning, right? You say, "Well, I
[1:28:35] shouted I and I got it." It wasn't so.
[1:28:37] Shouting is not the evidence of the Holy
[1:28:39] Ghost.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; I love this. To know Christ is to know
[1:28:44] the person of Christ in what, church? In
[1:28:47] the forgiveness of your sins. And I love
[1:28:51] this. And so forth. I'm sorry. And it
[1:28:54] changes your life.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; How many glad he's changed your life?
[1:28:59] Amen.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Like I told I told my son Zion, I said,
[1:29:04] "When I was in even when I was in the
[1:29:05] denominational church, I would go to
[1:29:07] church for an hour at the chapel and
[1:29:09] then I'd spend the next six hours
[1:29:10] watching football and basketball all day
[1:29:12] and I chew tobacco and I'd probably do
[1:29:15] I'd probably say things I shouldn't do."
[1:29:17] Like, was that really a life that's
[1:29:18] worthy of the gospel? No. I wasted so
[1:29:21] much time. I gave God one hour, two
[1:29:22] hours, and I give the world six or seven
[1:29:25] hours or some nonsense like that. That's
[1:29:27] not a life that's worthy of the gospel.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; It my life really wasn't changed. But
[1:29:32] once I came this message, I saw these
[1:29:33] brothers like Dave Llewellyn, Brother
[1:29:35] Craig, Brother Simon, Brother Brooks
[1:29:37] living such a godly life. And from that
[1:29:40] time, my life started changing.
[1:29:42] Hallelujah.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I mean, the the
[1:29:45] denominations changed my life a little
[1:29:47] bit, Brother Chris. But when I came to
[1:29:48] this message, everything changed. The
[1:29:51] Bible became a new Bible. Oh, the
[1:29:53] sermons are a joy to listen to. Like, I
[1:29:56] learned so much. Hallelujah. Reading the
[1:29:58] church age book. And I'm actually in
[1:29:59] chapter four of the church age book
[1:30:00] right now. Oh, it's such a blessing. If
[1:30:02] you haven't read that, church, you need
[1:30:03] to read that. Amen. I got free copies
[1:30:06] out there for you if you want them by
[1:30:07] God's grace. Oh my. I just read every I
[1:30:09] just read four pages every day. And if I
[1:30:12] miss a day, I don't say, "God, I'm
[1:30:13] condemned." Somebody say, "I'll do four
[1:30:15] tomorrow." Just pick up where you left
[1:30:17] off. Amen. Keep that word in your mind.
[1:30:20] Keep it right there at the forefront of
[1:30:22] your mind.
[1:30:24] Brother said, "I've seen people dance,
[1:30:25] shout, speak with tongues, so forth, and
[1:30:27] live any kind of a sinful life."
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; So, that couldn't be right. I've seen
[1:30:31] them join churches, shake hands,
[1:30:32] baptize, go through all kinds of creeds,
[1:30:34] still live like the devil. It wasn't so
[1:30:36] at the beginning. to meet him the person
[1:30:39] the Lord Jesus to know him as your own
[1:30:42] savior to know him as your lover to know
[1:30:45] him is life
[1:30:47] but all these creeds and things never at
[1:30:49] the beginning was ever witnessed by our
[1:30:51] Lord let's stand to our feet by God's
[1:30:53] grace how many enjoyed the word tonight
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:30:57] I have set the Lord always before my
[1:31:00] face can come we'll sing a few songs and
[1:31:02] see if there's prayer and if and if not
[1:31:04] then we'll move to uh testimonies
