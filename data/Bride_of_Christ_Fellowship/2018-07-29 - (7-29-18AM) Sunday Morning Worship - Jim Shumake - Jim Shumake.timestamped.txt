[34:54] God's Word let's sing all and all his
[35:09] congregation and I know what that's like
[35:11] to invite another minister in your
[35:13] pulpit Amanda I just thank God for the
[35:16] opportunity to say something for him
[35:18] this morning him and I'm not a great
[35:21] teacher as your pastor is and I've
[35:23] always admired brother Jesse since the
[35:25] first I met him and see how God has used
[35:27] him and I just think the great deal of
[35:30] him and his ministry here and what he's
[35:32] doing pray to God which is continuing to
[35:34] bless the little congregation here also
[35:36] amen if you have your Bibles this
[35:38] morning I want to get right into the
[35:39] word I I've been noted known at home to
[35:45] sometimes be lengthy so I've tried to
[35:46] cut the thought down this morning the
[35:49] best I can but I've been preaching a
[35:52] little fought at home on knowing we are
[35:56] the variety as we see the Day
[35:57] approaching and I want to continue maybe
[36:00] some of those thoughts have I preached
[36:02] six message along this looking at the
[36:05] characteristics of the Spirit of God and
[36:09] to try and put that all into one it's
[36:11] kind of hard so or two too so drive it
[36:14] mess this morning to just head in that
[36:16] direction and you just pray for me if
[36:18] you would if you have your Bibles turn
[36:20] with me to Hebrews the tenth chapter I
[36:22] heard your pastor quote this as I was
[36:24] sitting in the back as he was praying
[36:26] this one portion of the this scripture
[36:30] in hebrews hebrews chapter 10 and we'll
[36:32] start at the 22nd verse see what the
[36:34] Lord would speak to the body of Christ
[36:36] this morning amen ask it you pray for
[36:39] the congregation home where the Brian
[36:41] ministered for me this morning in the
[36:43] morning service brother Joe Martin will
[36:45] be ministering this evening in the
[36:46] evening service and I pray that God
[36:48] would use both the brothers and the
[36:50] church there would be blessed from
[36:52] having heard the Word of God
[36:53] good to see brother John and to Lisa
[36:56] and every one of you here this morning
[36:57] and haven't seen you for some time and
[37:00] pray that God would say something I
[37:02] don't feel worthy to stand before the
[37:04] purchase the blood of Jesus Christ I
[37:06] never do but by God's grace a man will
[37:08] say something that would be a blessing a
[37:10] man that's all we could ask this morning
[37:12] it means you love the Lord this morning
[37:15] Hebrews chapter 10 verse 22 reads like
[37:19] this let us draw near with a true heart
[37:21] of full assurance having faith of faith
[37:23] hard sprinkled from an evil conscience
[37:26] and our bodies washed with the pure
[37:28] water
[37:29] let us hold fast the profession of our
[37:31] faith without wavering for he is
[37:32] faithful that promised oh isn't it good
[37:34] to know that he's faithful this morning
[37:36] here we find a promise in the book he's
[37:38] faithful he men to fulfill the promise
[37:40] amen
[37:41] he said let us consider one another to
[37:44] provoke unto love and to good works not
[37:50] for Sanat forsaking the assembling of
[37:52] ourselves together as the manner of some
[37:54] is but exhorting one another and so much
[37:57] more as you see the Day approaching let
[38:02] us pray Heavenly Father Father we come
[38:04] to you this morning grateful hearts to
[38:06] be in your house Lord God we are so
[38:07] thankful for what you've done for us
[38:09] lord we're God and your death on the
[38:11] cross your shed blood that we could
[38:12] stand here Lord God amen justified in
[38:15] your sight like we never sinned in the
[38:17] first place a for us Lord and as we
[38:19] gather here this morning we pray father
[38:21] that you would guard my lips let's say
[38:23] something is contrary to the word but
[38:25] let all things be said to honor the name
[38:27] of the Lord Jesus Christ and to bring
[38:29] this portion of the body of Christ just
[38:31] a little closer to you father Lord God
[38:33] as we see the Day approaching Lord God
[38:35] we want to have a boldness or a
[38:37] confidence as the Word of God says here
[38:39] in Hebrews or God to stand fast in this
[38:42] day that we live Lord God not let the
[38:44] devil amen blow us about father God but
[38:47] to know who we are and who we are in
[38:48] Christ Jesus Lord God as we look into
[38:50] your word this morning we pray that you
[38:52] would help us each one to look Lord God
[38:54] with an open heart with an open mind
[38:56] father God and to take the Word of God
[38:58] and allow it to have a practical out
[39:00] working in our lives father we commit
[39:02] ourselves unto you and to these people
[39:04] or God we ask that you would just speak
[39:06] words it would encourage someone we can
[39:08] leave this place say that's been good to
[39:10] be
[39:10] in the house of the Lord today we commit
[39:11] ourselves in his body of Christ 1 we
[39:14] could leave this place say that's been
[39:15] good to be in the house of the Lord
[39:17] today we commit ourselves in this body
[39:18] of Christ in your hands in jesus name
[39:21] amen you can be seated this morning I've
[39:24] been preaching his thought at home as
[39:26] you see the Day approaching knowing we
[39:29] are the bride him in knowing we're the
[39:31] bride you know and I and I'm what I
[39:33] begin to look and think of this is I'd
[39:35] I'd counseled some people and talked to
[39:37] subpoenaed said stuff like oh I hope I
[39:39] make it and I want to know that I'm part
[39:42] of the bride I want to be sure that I am
[39:45] in the amend and they would have
[39:47] questions and things and I would say
[39:48] well you know they said well I remember
[39:50] the day that I got saved and I remember
[39:52] I spoke in tongues and I remember I
[39:54] shouted and I remember I took a lap
[39:56] around church I said glory that's all
[39:57] good I like all that stuff I mean I get
[40:00] a little bit crazy sometimes I mean one
[40:02] day brother Jack got excited in the
[40:04] church and he'd come around in front of
[40:05] the church and he tapped me on a shore
[40:07] said brother Jim come with me I said hey
[40:09] I'm with you we took a jericho march
[40:12] around the church they met when the
[40:13] brother would preach and I thought well
[40:15] glory I felt good hey man but you know
[40:17] that doesn't make me the bride of Jesus
[40:19] Christ amen I remember a bed of the
[40:23] Bible the prophet of God saying it he
[40:25] said he saw people that spoke in tongues
[40:27] a man and drank blood out of the human
[40:29] skull he said so it's not speaking
[40:31] tongues it's not not cutting your hair
[40:33] if you're a woman it's not it's not quit
[40:35] smoking or drinking always things that
[40:37] make you a bride of Jesus Christ is not
[40:39] paying your tithe or coming to church
[40:41] and doing all these things a man that
[40:43] you can point to and say I can know
[40:44] beyond a shadow of a doubt that I'm a
[40:46] bride of Jesus Christ how many want to
[40:49] know beyond a shadow of a doubt hey man
[40:51] but we had have a comma shirts in our
[40:53] heart that we are the bride of Jesus
[40:55] Christ I've been good to see sister
[40:57] Wendy a man I think R and daughter
[40:59] somebody said that you sent greetings
[41:01] and I thank God for that
[41:03] good to see each one of you here this
[41:04] morning a man but it's begin to think on
[41:08] this I began to talk to these people and
[41:09] find people wanting to know for certain
[41:12] that I am in the bride how many wants
[41:14] the nose hurt you're in the bride hey
[41:15] man but it's not all these things I mean
[41:17] it's not how long you grow your hair how
[41:19] long you wear your dress and all I
[41:21] believe in all that I believe
[41:23] if you're a Christian you will address
[41:24] the proper attire I believe you will act
[41:26] a certain way you will you will shun
[41:28] certain things they made in your life
[41:30] and accept and embrace others but it's
[41:33] not that that that that proves that
[41:35] you're the Bride of Christ but as I
[41:37] begin to look at these things I began to
[41:39] think about knowing you're the bride
[41:41] when you become the bride the Bible
[41:43] tells us you become bone of his bone
[41:45] flesh of his flesh spirit of his spirit
[41:48] is that right so if we are the same with
[41:52] him we become one with him and one with
[41:54] that spirit whatever that spirit and
[41:56] compelled him to do as the bride it will
[42:00] compel us to do the very same thing is
[42:02] that right so we can look at the Word of
[42:04] God and find out what the spirit
[42:06] compelled Jesus Christ to do and say if
[42:08] it's not complete to do the same thing
[42:10] or if I'm not doing the same thing I can
[42:12] tell you all day long I bribed you can
[42:14] look at me and say something doesn't
[42:15] ring true here something's not quite
[42:18] right here
[42:19] how many believes that so when I looked
[42:22] at this I said we can draw near with a
[42:24] heart of full assurance of faith amen
[42:27] having a heart sprinkled from evil
[42:29] concert our bodies washed with pure
[42:30] water the word amen we can hold fast the
[42:33] profession of our faith we don't have to
[42:35] waver we can know in this hour that we
[42:37] are the Bride of Christ amen amen
[42:40] all these things might change amen all
[42:42] this other stuff might change you may
[42:43] never speak in tongues you may you may
[42:45] do something you may make mistakes but
[42:47] does that make you not the bride it may
[42:49] be because you do those things no what
[42:52] makes you the bride is when you manifest
[42:54] the same works that he did because his
[42:56] spirit is in you they make how many
[42:58] believes that this morning we look over
[43:01] and st. John the fourteenth chapter amen
[43:03] in the 14th chapter say John I just want
[43:05] to read this it's kind of lengthy but
[43:07] just bear with me if you would jesus
[43:08] saith unto them I am the way the truth
[43:11] and the life no man cometh unto the
[43:13] father but by me if you had known me you
[43:16] should have not seen him from this point
[43:18] forward you're gonna know if you see me
[43:21] you've seen the father why would they
[43:22] say that because he would do in the very
[43:24] same things the word goes on and tells
[43:26] us that the father compelled him to do
[43:28] he didn't do anything that what the
[43:30] father didn't compel him to do Jesus
[43:32] said he seemed if I been so long time
[43:34] Philip said show us the father and it
[43:36] will suffice with us he says and jesus
[43:39] saith unto Him have I been so long with
[43:41] you and have not known me Philip
[43:43] he he that has seen me has seen the
[43:46] father how say us now then show us the
[43:49] father believe that believe thou not
[43:52] that I am in the father and the father
[43:54] that in me the word that I speak unto
[43:57] you there not of myself amen
[44:00] he said but the father that dwelleth in
[44:01] me he doeth the works nor does
[44:04] everything he does was because that
[44:06] spirit of the father was in her does
[44:08] everything he does was because that
[44:10] spirit of the father was in him nobody
[44:13] believes that that's more than amen he
[44:15] says believe that I'm in the father and
[44:17] the father me or believe me for the very
[44:20] works sake he said the very works that
[44:24] he was doing were the works of the
[44:26] Father amen whatever the far did
[44:28] whenever the spirit was of the father
[44:30] the son did the same works because of
[44:33] the spirit that was in him there was
[44:35] characteristics of the spirit that were
[44:38] being manifestly declared through the
[44:40] body of Jesus Christ is that right he
[44:43] says verily man I said he who that
[44:45] believeth on me the worst thing that I
[44:46] do shall he do also if you really are
[44:49] the bride this morning you will do the
[44:51] same works that Jesus Christ hid is that
[44:54] right is that okay hey man hey we all
[44:57] want to say amen to that but church it's
[44:59] time to examine ourselves as we see the
[45:02] Day approaching because we want to know
[45:04] if we are really the bride or not amen
[45:07] amen you know you look around here every
[45:09] Church claims to be the bride every
[45:11] Church claims that they have the messies
[45:13] every Church claims that they are the
[45:15] one the church there is only one bride
[45:17] it goes home with me from Akron tonight
[45:20] she sits right there amen it doesn't
[45:22] matter what you claim a man
[45:24] it's what the word says this place what
[45:26] the Spirit says this morning he says boy
[45:29] said the works that I do show you do
[45:31] also and greater works than he showed
[45:33] you because I'm going to the Father he's
[45:37] going away but Church even he wasn't
[45:40] gone very long
[45:41] he was only gone tell me how many knows
[45:43] he was only gone 10 days Amy he said he
[45:45] wasn't going going to to the Father him
[45:47] in but he says you're going to do the
[45:50] very
[45:50] works that I do you're going to do the
[45:52] very same things that I do you are going
[45:55] to do he says he said but I'm going to
[45:58] father whatsoever you asking my name

[46:00] in the son and if you ask anything in my
[46:02] name I'll do it if you love me keep my
[46:04] Commandments but then he goes over

[49:10] ourselves together and exhort one
[49:12] another and much more as we see that Day
[49:14] approaching not to forsake the
[49:16] assembling of ourselves together why did
[49:18] Paul say that well the writer of Hebrews
[49:20] say that because he said that Spirit of
[49:24] Christ would be in us in the last day
[49:27] and the last day he's coming back for a
[49:28] bride who is bone of his bone flesh is
[49:31] flesh spirit of his spirit so as we see

[49:38] Spirit Christ being lived out through a
[49:40] body hey man how many believes at this
[49:42] point it's okay if I take my coat off my

[49:47] here and that's what I was looking for I
[49:49] mean nobody can find mine's hid under
[49:51] there they always throw it in a chair
[49:52] but that's alright a man you can put it
[49:55] wherever you want a man some people want
[49:57] you to keep your coat on him and I don't
[49:59] like fighting with a coat I'm in a man
[50:01] so I'm fighting the devil this morning
[50:03] is that Alright so we want to see the
[50:05] Spirit of God manifested in our lives
[50:08] amen let's go back and see the life of
[50:11] Christ and the works that the Spirit did
[50:13] in his life when he was down the earth a
[50:15] bit is that Alright
[50:16] if it's going to be the same thing let's
[50:18] go back so we look back in the Bible
[50:19] let's take a look at Luke Luke 40 or
[50:21] Luke the fourth chapter the fourteenth
[50:23] verse the Luke 14 hey man this is the
[50:26] spirit God manifesting itself in Christ
[50:29] Jesus amazed that sad that all right
[50:32] Luke excuse me Luke 14 Luke 4 verse 14
[50:36] we read these words and Jesus returned
[50:39] in power of the Spirit we find Jesus the
[50:43] man Christ Jesus but he says in Christ
[50:45] Jesus he's returning in the power of the
[50:48] Spirit the Spirit is in him is that
[50:51] Alright amen and the spirit in him
[50:54] compelled him to do exactly what the
[50:56] Prophet said we are to do in this age
[50:58] the Word of God said where do we are to
[51:01] find ourselves gathered together hey man
[51:03] when the church doors open on Sunday
[51:05] where are we we're finding ourselves
[51:07] someplace gathered together a man with
[51:10] the Word of God
[51:10] hey man is that Alright they said he
[51:12] returned the spirit of power in the
[51:14] Galilee and there went out of Fame of
[51:16] him through all the region round about
[51:18] and a bit and it says and he began to
[51:20] tour in the Galilee and there went our
[51:22] fame of him through all the region round
[51:24] about and a bit and it says and he began
[51:26] to teach in their synagogues he began to
[51:31] teach her said well brother Jim I'm not
[51:32] a teacher hey man he said brother Jim
[51:34] I'm not a preacher brother Branham says
[51:36] every one of us if that spirit of Christ
[51:38] is in our very lies like Paul said my
[51:41] speech in my preaching was not with
[51:42] enticing words of some man's wisdom but
[51:44] it was in demonstration of the Spirit
[51:47] and the power of God demonstrated out of
[51:50] our lives hey man it will demonstrate
[51:53] the very spirit the very life of cried
[51:55] you will be lived voices preaching out
[51:58] the gospel that spirits in you this
[52:00] morning hey man how many believes that
[52:02] and not only will you be doing that but
[52:05] it'll be hard to keep you from doing
[52:06] that

[52:10] of the Spirit is in you it will compel
[52:12] you to do that amen how many believes
[52:15] that hey man Jesus returned the spirit
[52:17] of power and he taught in their
[52:19] synagogues being glorified of all and he
[52:22] came to dad's would have been where he'd
[52:23] been brought up at was as it was his
[52:25] custom notice that it was his custom
[52:27] this is just the way he did it
[52:30] curse they could say where'd brother Jim

[52:33] brother Jim oh he's over a church over
[52:36] there on the other side of the tracks
[52:37] that's where he always is on Sunday
[52:40] I bet he not in a ball game or a picnic
[52:43] or some family doing is it to her
[52:44] because that's where the Word of God
[52:46] would compel him to be if that spirit
[52:48] see anything they say all right now but

[52:54] going to lead illegals I know there's
[52:56] times when you can't and there's certain
[52:58] extenuating search

[55:43] said you can't hardly wait for those
[55:45] doors to open out yonder and get in here
[55:47] to fellowship with the bud and if you
[55:49] don't feel that way it's time you got
[55:51] the prayed he said you know why if you
[55:53] don't feel that way because you're not
[55:54] manifest in that spirit because that's
[55:56] the spirit within him he had to be there
[55:59] he couldn't wait to get there he just
[56:01] could yeah I'll bet he got up that
[56:03] morning said it's Sunday I can't wait to
[56:05] get to church I'll bet he got up and
[56:07] said oh boy I just can't wait to go to

[56:33] the word he says cuz we're in that he
[56:36] said if you don't feel that way is time
[56:38] you got to pray and why because the
[56:39] spirits not manifest in the life that
[56:41] was in Christ that's the spirit that's
[56:42] what could he did the spirit compelled
[56:45] him to do that he said if you don't feel
[56:47] that same way you better get to praying
[56:49] you better say Lord God I need a fresh
[56:51] anointing of your spirit this morning
[56:54] here he says cuz we are in the
[56:57] asked how many believes were in the last
[56:58] days we are in the last days is it all
[57:01] right to read a quote of the Prophet
[57:03] amen he says where the Bible exhorted us
[57:06] to much more he's quoting Hebrews much
[57:09] more as we see the Day approaching a man
[57:12] to love one another with Christian love
[57:14] double love one another to love one
[57:18] another he said by this will all men
[57:21] know you are my disciples when you have
[57:22] that love one for another amen
[57:28] when Jesus returned the Spirit of the
[57:32] Lord was upon him church came in and it
[57:35] compelled him to go and preach the
[57:37] gospel
[57:38] hey man why did he preach the gospel
[57:39] because he saw me lost he saw you lost
[57:42] he saw people lost a man that day and he
[57:45] loved them and loved him and he didn't
[57:47] want to see him remain lost so I began
[57:49] to preach the gospel he saw people that
[57:51] were sick and he didn't wanted to remain
[57:52] sick so I began to preach the gospel
[57:54] amen amen
[57:55] he began to show them I bet that the
[57:57] spirit in him would do the works of
[57:59] healing a man do the works of salvation
[58:01] do the works of delivering a man that
[58:03] may knows that this morning but if the
[58:05] spirits in us it will cause us remount
[58:07] the very same thing to the world how may
[58:09] a man I want to tell everybody God the
[58:12] healer and go around sick oh I'd better
[58:14] tell everybody God's a way maker go
[58:16] around I just don't know what I'm gonna
[58:17] do something's wrong there Church the
[58:19] spirits not right that all right amen
[58:24] the Spirit of the Lord is upon me he
[58:26] said if the spirit Lord is upon you him
[58:28] it will do the same thing he did he said
[58:31] the Spirit of Lord is upon me because he
[58:32] has anointed me to preach the gospel to
[58:36] the poor a man church a bed there every
[58:39] one of us is poor him in one way or

[1:11:15] manifesting Spirit of Christ he says and
[1:11:17] those elect with him in that day we'll
[1:11:21] be the ones who truly manifest the Lord
[1:11:24] and be his body be his voice and perform
[1:11:27] his works she said do you see it do you
[1:11:31] see it he said those elect will be the
[1:11:33] ones that knew the very works what did
[1:11:35] John say over here in the scripture we
[1:11:38] read he said the works that I do show
[1:11:40] you new and greater works than these you
[1:11:41] do because I'm going the Father time
[1:11:43] said in my spirit and my spirit in you
[1:11:45] you'll do the very same works that I did
[1:11:48] hate me that's why the Prophet could say
[1:11:50] that this morning there is a body in
[1:11:52] this day who would going to manifest the
[1:11:54] works of Christ because God's Spirit
[1:11:56] will be in her hallelujah girl

[1:12:09] again another people in the land who are
[1:12:11] under there who under their messenger

[1:12:17] be some church's voice it won't be some
[1:12:19] denominational voice it'll be the voice
[1:12:22] it won't be some church's voice it won't
[1:12:24] be some denominational voice it'll be
[1:12:26] the voice of the Spirit of God speaking
[1:12:29] out hey man
[1:12:30] declaring him and the same thing that
[1:12:32] Christ did preaching the same doing the
[1:12:34] same work same n that he did and what
[1:12:38] did he do he manifestly declared him an
[1:12:41] the day of deliverance he manifested
[1:12:44] declare the day of Jubilee true
[1:12:46] him and he manifested declared that he
[1:12:48] had no matter how long Satan thinks he's
[1:12:50] got a hold of you and a habit or a
[1:12:53] problem that you're having amen there is
[1:12:55] a time when that spirit enters it that
[1:12:57] he no longer has control and I've been
[1:13:00] set free I heard the Jubilee I heard the
[1:13:03] trumpet sounding in my day I be set free
[1:13:07] he says oh yes he says in your very life
[1:13:10] ought to be screaming that out just as
[1:13:12] his was the Bible says when he was when
[1:13:15] he was when he came into the temple what
[1:13:16] did he do he said the Lord the Lord had
[1:13:19] anointed him amen
[1:13:22] to preach the Spirit of God upon him
[1:13:24] because they anointed me to preach the
[1:13:26] gospel church amen if the spirits on
[1:13:28] earth will do the very same thing we
[1:13:31] will preach the gospel the ability of I
[1:13:33] can't preach a man you can just preach
[1:13:36] it by your very life for your very life
[1:13:39] he said like I said to begin with he
[1:13:41] said what brother Bram said what what we
[1:13:43] need in Jeffersonville is thousands of
[1:13:45] lived voices he says cry it out the
[1:13:48] sweet thundered out the Word of God him
[1:13:51] here he said that's what we need not
[1:13:52] only in Jefferson billet but in Albion
[1:13:54] Pennsylvania and Akron Ohio he needs to
[1:13:57] have a voice that lived the Word of God
[1:13:59] lived out through that voice Amy Amy he
[1:14:04] said yes it is he said yes sir the
[1:14:06] church was no longer the mouthpiece of
[1:14:08] God the church so to speak
[1:14:10] denominational Church and he's
[1:14:12] confounded her through the Prophet and
[1:14:14] the bride for the voice of God will be
[1:14:16] in her the voice of God listen the voice
[1:14:19] of God will you can't have a voice of
[1:14:21] somebody they've had like brother BAM
[1:14:23] said he said if I'll come up here and
[1:14:24] told you I had the spirit of
[1:14:26] Michelangelo in me he said you'd expect
[1:14:28] me to be some great sculptor or painter
[1:14:30] or what he was if I told you I had the
[1:14:33] spirit of Beethoven in me you
[1:14:34] begged me to get up here and play on the
[1:14:37] piano like brother Laursen brother yeah
[1:14:40] look I mean hey some great concerto or
[1:14:43] something hey man
[1:14:44] that bait could that spirit would be in
[1:14:46] me hey mean is that right if I get up
[1:14:48] here and I say now I'm gonna play the
[1:14:50] fifth symphony and I go something sounds
[1:14:55] like chopsticks you say I don't think
[1:14:58] you got the spirit of bait oh but you
[1:15:01] know what we're claiming to have the
[1:15:02] spirit of god and we're playing some big
[1:15:04] rinky-dink Tintin in a church we ought
[1:15:06] to be streaming out at the gospel hymn
[1:15:08] and I delivered the power of God in here
[1:15:10] how do I believe that this morning a man
[1:15:13] we can't de base it on what we think we
[1:15:15] know what we're doing I mean we have to
[1:15:17] base it upon the same spirit that was in

[1:16:27] directly from God just like they did at
[1:16:30] Pentecost just like they did at
[1:16:34] Pentecost now we're going to be the
[1:16:36] voice of God it's like it was at
[1:16:38] Pentecost I'll better go back and see
[1:16:40] what it was like if the prophecy is
[1:16:43] going to hear from voice of God in a
[1:16:45] bride amen and we all claim well I got
[1:16:47] the voice of God
[1:16:48] let's see if it's the real voice of God
[1:16:50] he said it's like it was at Pentecost
[1:16:53] let's go back and look and see how it
[1:16:56] was at Pentecost maybe you know we go
[1:16:58] back to Pentecost we find a bunch of
[1:17:00] believers that were trying to follow
[1:17:01] Jesus try we find him run in him and we
[1:17:04] find him scared we find him a bed not
[1:17:06] knowing what to do him it's the first
[1:17:08] little bump in the road him and even
[1:17:10] though the scripture said it would be
[1:17:11] that way that island themselves fearful
[1:17:13] they find themselves without power
[1:17:16] they found himself unable to convince
[1:17:18] anybody that Jesus was the Christ and is
[1:17:20] that right but you know what he told him
[1:17:22] he says you go and wait you go and wait
[1:17:25] you until in Jerusalem until you be
[1:17:26] endued with power even he knew what it
[1:17:31] took he knew what it took to manifest
[1:17:33] the word he said you can't preach the
[1:17:35] gospel you can't do the Great Commission
[1:17:37] until you're in dude with the Spirit of
[1:17:39] God that spirits got to be in you
[1:17:41] huddled someplace they met one with
[1:17:43] another and guess what they were doing
[1:17:45] they were exhorting one another Oh
[1:17:47] remember when they did this I can just
[1:17:48] see him in that upper room I wasn't
[1:17:50] there but I wished I had to be he's I
[1:17:52] just see him at unapprove Oh remember
[1:17:54] when he said this he did that old the
[1:17:56] God he said that same power would be
[1:17:57] enough maybe and they prayed a little
[1:17:59] harder Church I think we need to start
[1:18:01] praying a little bit harder but notice
[1:18:03] the spirit a man was propelling them he
[1:18:06] told him you going gather together
[1:18:07] assemble ourselves together and he says
[1:18:09] and wait for the power of the Spirit to
[1:18:11] come and he says that they were sitting
[1:18:14] at a per room and the Spirit of God fell
[1:18:16] on them they come down at a table roof
[1:18:18] they weren't afraid anymore when they
[1:18:20] come down out of the upper room brother
[1:18:22] Jesse Peter and John comes strutting
[1:18:23] down out of there and it wasn't some
[1:18:25] proud thing it wasn't some pride thing
[1:18:27] look at me who I am but they came in
[1:18:29] with a confidence hey they came with a
[1:18:32] confidence they drew with heart full of
[1:18:35] the surveys having our hearts sprinkled
[1:18:37] from an evil their bodies washed
[1:18:38] with pure water they came down out of
[1:18:40] there with the whole spirit all over
[1:18:42] them hey man is that right
[1:18:43] and when they came down with the holy
[1:18:45] spirit all over him guess what they
[1:18:46] begin to do the spirit that was in
[1:18:48] Christ caused him to preach deliverance
[1:18:50] amen they come down there and they walk
[1:18:52] by the gate beautiful and they're sad
[1:18:54] some guys that had been there for his
[1:18:55] whole life I mean he had been their
[1:18:58] whole life

[1:19:02] whoom this cartel this is that right
[1:19:04] he'd been lame from his mother's womb
[1:19:07] and when Peter and John walked down out
[1:19:09] of there now no longer their spirit of
[1:19:11] fear but a spirit of boldness a spirit
[1:19:14] of confidence when they came down out of
[1:19:15] that Peru they walked up and said silver
[1:19:17] and gold I don't have a man they were
[1:19:20] true believers silver and gold I don't
[1:19:23] have any but such as I have I got
[1:19:25] something that's worth more than all the
[1:19:26] gold I got something's worth more than
[1:19:28] all the silver I got something worth
[1:19:30] saving a fortune hey man seek I seek it
[1:19:33] as a precious jewel Oh God I thank God
[1:19:36] for what I got this morning at Peter a
[1:19:39] man and John knew what they had they had
[1:19:42] a heart full of assurance a man that
[1:19:44] they could preach the same gospel that
[1:19:46] he preached because they had to say
[1:19:48] spirited him that he had it and what did
[1:19:51] he do he walked down there he said I
[1:19:52] don't have silver and gold but what I
[1:19:54] got I can give to you I can give to you

[1:20:04] maybe what was it him now preaching the
[1:20:07] year of Jubilee the apprec come down he
[1:20:10] said preaching the acceptable year of
[1:20:12] the Lord he come now preaching the year
[1:20:15] of Jubilee the priest he come down
[1:20:18] he said preaching the acceptable year of
[1:20:20] the Lord when the Spirit of God is in a
[1:20:23] we will preach the same gospel that
[1:20:25] Jesus preached and we will manifestly
[1:20:28] declare what we're preaching is real
[1:20:30] this morning church that Spirit of God
[1:20:32] is in a is real he said we have not
[1:20:34] because we ask not he come down he says
[1:20:37] he said I don't have any silver a gold
[1:20:39] that you're asking for but I got some
[1:20:41] it's a greater treasure I got something
[1:20:44] that's able to set you free he preached
[1:20:46] the year of deliverance he preached the
[1:20:48] year of Jubilee he took him by the hand
[1:20:50] and immediately his ankle bones received
[1:20:52] straight and he went jumping and leaping
[1:20:54] and praising God hallelujah church amen
[1:20:57] when was the last time we saw a brother
[1:20:58] or sister come into church him and it
[1:21:00] was afflicted it and brother Jesse come

[1:21:12] have I have they can deliver you from
[1:21:14] that Hey
[1:21:15] we got that same power within us to do
[1:21:18] the same thing he said we will do the
[1:21:21] very same thing we will point them to a
[1:21:24] God who is more than able how many
[1:21:27] believes that this morning a man he says
[1:21:31] that you know what they said about these
[1:21:34] people in acts 4 chapter he said after
[1:21:37] this man was glorifying God and the
[1:21:39] people all began to look at them
[1:21:40] Amy this is one of the other portion of
[1:21:44] the thing I tried and right here but man
[1:21:46] we'd be here all day if I did but I
[1:21:49] preached amen one of the other
[1:21:50] characteristic Spirit of Christ was he
[1:21:52] humbled himself he made himself of no
[1:21:55] reputation a man is that right and when
[1:21:58] they began to point at them and say and
[1:21:59] begin to hold on to them say oh look at
[1:22:01] what these men did look what a lot of
[1:22:03] people do in this message you know they
[1:22:04] have some great ministry people began to
[1:22:06] look at them and they start to puff
[1:22:07] their chest out say yeah I got a
[1:22:09] thousand people coming to my church boy
[1:22:11] I'm really something if that's not the
[1:22:13] spirit Christ Church something wrong
[1:22:14] right away that's another whole message
[1:22:17] I don't want to get into that hey man
[1:22:18] but he made you know what it said he
[1:22:20] humbled himself and the Spirit was in
[1:22:23] him that caused him to Humble himself to
[1:22:24] take upon himself a form of a servant a
[1:22:26] man he meant he'd made himself of no
[1:22:28] reputation even though he had the power
[1:22:30] of God any man Peter and John done the
[1:22:35] same thing they says don't look at us
[1:22:36] like we've done this
[1:22:38] don't look at us like this is something
[1:22:40] that weird some great thing that we can
[1:22:42] do he says very John Jesus Christ the
[1:22:46] one whom you crucified that's the one
[1:22:48] that's why this man stands here whole
[1:22:50] that's why he's here this morning they
[1:22:52] made Church of that spirit enough will
[1:22:54] have the power to do that well we won't
[1:22:55] make a big deal over at a man we will
[1:22:58] just preach that word and say important
[1:23:00] to the one who's more than able hey man
[1:23:02] he preached the gospel hey man the one
[1:23:04] that did this was the same one that can
[1:23:06] deliver your soul from Hell him he says
[1:23:09] when they saw the boldness of Peter John
[1:23:12] they perceived that they were unlearned
[1:23:13] and ignorant men hey man just like old
[1:23:15] brother Jim they marveled and took
[1:23:17] knowledge that they had been with Christ
[1:23:19] a man they didn't look what they were
[1:23:20] they saw Christ in them they saw the
[1:23:23] spirit in and they say there's something
[1:23:25] about him he act just like that
[1:23:27] fisherman that they used
[1:23:28] for here just like that carpenter rather
[1:23:30] that they used to follow around church
[1:23:34] that's what I wanted to say about me
[1:23:35] this morning that's what they ought to
[1:23:37] be saying about you this moon maybe you
[1:23:39] could Church that's what I wanted to say
[1:23:42] about me this morning that's what they
[1:23:44] ought to be saying about you this moon
[1:23:46] maybe you could tell me all day long
[1:23:48] you're the Bride of Christ but if that
[1:23:50] same spirit to do the same words that
[1:23:51] have the same desire that he had is not
[1:23:53] in a it's time we got the praying how
[1:23:56] many believes that this morning we're in
[1:23:57] the last days I mean who we are to
[1:24:01] gather together to exhort to build one
[1:24:03] another up you know what when you come
[1:24:05] here and testify what God did for you
[1:24:06] the last week you know what that does
[1:24:08] that just builds up the body that just
[1:24:10] exhorts them maybe when God set you free
[1:24:13] when God delivers you when God comes
[1:24:15] here you're on your tear rescue comes on
[1:24:17] the scene and in any area of your life
[1:24:19] Amen we ought to be screaming it out to
[1:24:21] everybody that will hear him to preach
[1:24:23] the gospel look what God did for me I
[1:24:26] mean and he ain't no respecter person
[1:24:28] would do the same thing for you how many
[1:24:31] believes that this morning later on we
[1:24:35] find the same disciple they're being
[1:24:37] scattered after team was persecuted Amen
[1:24:39] I preached another message on that him
[1:24:40] in the same series he said and some of
[1:24:44] them were men of Cypress of cyrene which
[1:24:46] when they've come to expect Antioch
[1:24:48] spoke to the Grecian speaking preaching
[1:24:50] the Lord Jesus Christ there they are
[1:24:52] they're scattered the same spirit where
[1:24:53] they do their preaching no matter where
[1:24:55] they go
[1:24:55] there's preach in Jesus Christ wherever
[1:24:58] they go and the best spirits in you when
[1:25:00] you're at work you'll reach in Jesus
[1:25:02] Christ to all your buddies hey man
[1:25:03] amen wherever you are if you're at the
[1:25:05] school you'll be preaching it to all
[1:25:06] your schoolmates wherever you are if
[1:25:08] you're at Walmart you'll be preaching
[1:25:10] Jesus Christ they've been just by your
[1:25:11] very life say man he says then you can't
[1:25:15] wait and every opportunity you have
[1:25:17] you'll find yourself because that custom
[1:25:19] if the spirits then use that that was
[1:25:22] his custom that right and when they came
[1:25:26] him they were preaching the Lord Jesus
[1:25:29] Christ and the Bible says in acts 11 21
[1:25:30] and the hand of the Lord was with them
[1:25:32] and a great number believed and turned
[1:25:35] to the Lord because of their preaching
[1:25:37] of the gospel because of their living
[1:25:40] out because of the spirit that was in a
[1:25:42] being lived out through them they preach
[1:25:43] the gospel that says in many many how
[1:25:47] many want many in your neighborhood how
[1:25:48] many more many in your family hey man
[1:25:50] even he said you got to preach the
[1:25:52] gospel and if the Spirit didn't you
[1:25:55] you will preach the gospel and if you're
[1:25:57] not it's time to get a fresh filler this
[1:25:59] morning he says who then really
[1:26:02] he said they tell you that they came to
[1:26:03] ears of the church was in Jerusalem they
[1:26:05] sent Barnabas that he should go as far
[1:26:08] as an he heard what was going they met
[1:26:09] her the revival going let's get down
[1:26:11] there get it see the Spirit of God
[1:26:12] compelled him I want to be where the
[1:26:14] revivals hot and heavy and when he came
[1:26:18] and seen the grace of God and was glad
[1:26:20] what did he do he said he exhorted a man
[1:26:23] why did he do that because the Spirit of
[1:26:24] God was in him how do you know brother
[1:26:27] Jim because the next verse say that was
[1:26:30] he exhorted them all with all the
[1:26:33] purpose of heart they would cleave to
[1:26:35] the Lord I mean you know what that word
[1:26:37] clean means it means to become one with
[1:26:40] man it means remember when that guy one
[1:26:43] of David's mighty man he said he slew
[1:26:45] all those Egyptians were those uh enemy
[1:26:48] I can't remember what it was Philistines
[1:26:50] or whatever was the Bible said that the
[1:26:52] sword clave to his hand they become one
[1:26:55] with his head when he swung that sword
[1:26:58] it was one of him church that's what we
[1:27:00] are we're to cleave to him become one
[1:27:02] with him bone of his bone flesh misplace
[1:27:04] quickly become one with the Lord had the
[1:27:07] same spirit him in before he was a good
[1:27:10] man he was preaching the gospel he was
[1:27:12] preaching that they should become one
[1:27:14] with him and his spirit would be been in
[1:27:16] dwelling them doing enable them to do
[1:27:17] the very same thing he says because he
[1:27:19] was a good man full of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:22] he had the spirit if the spirit was in
[1:27:25] him that made Christ do that it made him
[1:27:27] do the very same thing this morning how
[1:27:30] many believes it he said he was full the
[1:27:34] whole ego and a faith and much people
[1:27:36] were added to the Lord he preached the
[1:27:39] gospel by his very demonstration by his
[1:27:42] very manifestly declaring the Spirit of
[1:27:45] God that was in him he said they need
[1:27:49] from Tarsus to seek soul and they had
[1:27:52] found they brought him back in and it
[1:27:54] came to pass that the whole year what
[1:27:55] did they do they assembled themselves
[1:27:57] together how many want to do that this
[1:28:00] morning a man they assembled themselves
[1:28:04] together themselves together with the
[1:28:08] church and taught much people and the
[1:28:12] disciples were called Christians why
[1:28:13] they were christ-like they were first
[1:28:16] called Christians at Antioch because
[1:28:18] they were christ-like they were saying
[1:28:22] all this for brother Jim amen I got two
[1:28:25] or three paise I don't know if I'll get
[1:28:26] to my cut two or three things out I want
[1:28:28] to say but and I try to be brief this
[1:28:30] morning but church what are you trying
[1:28:31] to say but I'm trying to say that it as
[1:28:33] we see the Day approaching we can know
[1:28:36] that we are the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:28:38] because we're born of his bone flesh
[1:28:40] respect that spirit of the Spirit have
[1:28:42] been happy to know brother Jim because
[1:28:43] the Spirit that was it him compelled him
[1:28:45] to do certain things and if that same
[1:28:47] spirit sat us it'll compel us to do the
[1:28:49] very same thing in fact as you can't do
[1:28:51] anything else you know that you can't do
[1:28:55] anything else
[1:28:57] amen it's a spirit hey man you watch a
[1:28:59] little duck you watch a little duck a
[1:29:03] man in a few months a man that duck
[1:29:04] might be swimming out there on your pond
[1:29:06] behind your house we got him to come and
[1:29:08] swim around on our palm behind how but
[1:29:10] here brother Bram said all of a sudden
[1:29:12] one fall days the wind will blow across
[1:29:14] that pond and a cold chill from across
[1:29:17] that pond he said and you'll see one
[1:29:19] little duck out there he'd put he's a
[1:29:20] little honker up in the air and he'll
[1:29:24] let out a scream and he'll head south
[1:29:27] just as fast as he can't tell all the
[1:29:29] other come with me why did he do that he
[1:29:31] can't help but do that why because
[1:29:34] there's a spirit in him amen he's a duck
[1:29:36] if he doesn't he'll die and there's a
[1:29:38] spirit in us if we're sons and daughters
[1:29:40] of God will do what he did or we'll die
[1:29:42] hey man we have to have the same spirit
[1:29:45] in us in it how many believe that this
[1:29:48] morning oh he said that's it man is
[1:29:51] always glorifying God rejoice what God
[1:29:53] has done there's this quote I was
[1:29:55] talking about there saying he what he
[1:29:56] will do and they're ignoring what he
[1:29:58] should be doing right now what he is
[1:30:00] doing right now what he should be doing
[1:30:02] right now the
[1:30:03] same thing he did that were glorifying
[1:30:05] God for what he did all other what he
[1:30:07] did look how he walked down there and he
[1:30:09] preached delivers to the captive leave
[1:30:11] preached the year of deliverance him and
[1:30:14] he preached the year of Jubilee

[1:30:18] spirit upon him he gathered with her
[1:30:20] brothers and sisters
[1:30:21] he came tersh it was this custom oh look
[1:30:23] what he did in that wonderful hymn in
[1:30:25] and one day he'll gather us all together

[1:30:52] here it is he said am and always talk
[1:30:55] and he said but they're missing what
[1:30:56] he's doing right now they believe what
[1:30:58] he's done and shout about they talk
[1:31:00] about what you're going to a glorify God
[1:31:01] but what is he doing right now they
[1:31:03] ignored he said it's just the nature of
[1:31:05] man to do that that's just the way you
[1:31:06] see he said but we don't have that
[1:31:09] nature anymore if the Spirit dwells in
[1:31:11] you that nature's naughty he said but we
[1:31:14] don't have that nature anymore if the
[1:31:15] Spirit dwells in you that nature is not
[1:31:18] in you you're out preaching that word
[1:31:20] Amen you know what Jesus said he said I
[1:31:22] am the vine you are the great he said if
[1:31:26] it's out of the same vine we're living
[1:31:28] off the same it'll bring forth grapes I
[1:31:31] know what you're thinking brother Brian
[1:31:32] said I know what you're thinking he said
[1:31:34] I saw an orange tree growing lemons one
[1:31:36] time he said no that's man-made idea
[1:31:39] grafted in that's something that man
[1:31:41] grafted in it's just living off the
[1:31:44] church it's just living off a bad that
[1:31:47] body said but it's not true fruit of the
[1:31:49] vine it's not manifesting the true fruit
[1:31:51] of the Spirit it's not manifesting that
[1:31:54] true fruit of the Spirit just some
[1:31:55] man-made grafted anything living off the
[1:31:58] Church of this day hey man he said but
[1:32:00] if that Brian by never brings forward
[1:32:02] another branch it will produce an orange
[1:32:05] if it's an orange tree
[1:32:06] halli if they said if this church ever
[1:32:09] brings forth another church at this Brad
[1:32:11] and brings forth another church he said
[1:32:13] it will be another church like it was at
[1:32:15] Pentecost and they'll write another
[1:32:17] book of Acts behind it hallelujah how
[1:32:20] they believed that this boy fruit did it
[1:32:23] bear these signs shall follow them that
[1:32:25] believe in my name they will cast out
[1:32:28] Devils a man how many believed that you
[1:32:30] had that power within you this morning
[1:32:32] the same power that he had in Luke 14
[1:32:34] when he said the Spirit of God is upon
[1:32:36] me caused me to preach the gospel to
[1:32:38] preach deliver a man to preach
[1:32:40] deliverance to the captives area to
[1:32:42] preach the gospel hey man to the
[1:32:43] brokenhearted to preach deliverance to
[1:32:45] the captives to recover his sight to
[1:32:46] fine and deliberate heed of them that
[1:32:48] are bruised and held down and depressed
[1:32:50] under me
[1:32:51] he said that same spirits in you when it
[1:32:54] brings forth another Church in this our
[1:32:56] church how can I know that I am bride
[1:32:58] bone of his bone flesh of his flesh
[1:33:00] spirit of his spirit he said I'll
[1:33:02] produce the very same thing he did he
[1:33:04] said and we'll hear once again from God
[1:33:07] like it did at Pentecost it'll be a
[1:33:09] Pentecostal Church like it was in his
[1:33:12] day like the first church he made he
[1:33:15] said oh the second church rises up the
[1:33:17] mystical body of Christ have the same
[1:33:19] signs he says let alone the world see me
[1:33:22] no more you'll see me I'll be with you
[1:33:23] even in you even to the end of the world
[1:33:25] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:33:26] and forever the Church of the Living God
[1:33:28] that's who it is that's the kind of
[1:33:30] witness he'll have in this day the same
[1:33:32] witness that he was in his day
[1:33:35] how many believes that this movie a man
[1:33:38] I believe with all my heart a man if
[1:33:40] it's going to be the same kind of
[1:33:42] witness to do the same things he did a
[1:33:44] man will gather like he did he says when
[1:33:47] the spirit was upon him it caused him to
[1:33:51] go to the synagogue if that spirit
[1:33:54] Sepang off church it'll cause us to go
[1:33:56] to the synagogues when the doors are
[1:33:58] open why said it was just his custom it
[1:34:00] was just his manner Church why was it
[1:34:02] isn't matter because the spirit in him
[1:34:04] was compelling him to do that church if
[1:34:07] that spirits in us this morning amen and
[1:34:09] we don't have that compelling desire to
[1:34:12] be in the house of God when the doors
[1:34:13] are open I think we need a refilling of
[1:34:16] that spirit I think we do refreshing of
[1:34:18] that spirit this morning you know that
[1:34:21] we don't it's you know so many people
[1:34:23] too refreshing of that spirit this
[1:34:25] morning you know that we don't it's you
[1:34:28] know so many people were banking on the
[1:34:30] fact that they believed
[1:34:31] God sent a prophet I thank God that I
[1:34:32] believe God sent a prophet so many
[1:34:34] people are banking on the fact that I
[1:34:35] pay my ties or I don't cut my hair I
[1:34:38] don't do all these things or I spoke in
[1:34:39] tongues or I shout and do this even I
[1:34:41] believe in all my stuff
[1:34:43] which church how I know that I'm bone of
[1:34:45] his bone flesh flesh the spirit of the
[1:34:47] Spirit is the Spirit will live out
[1:34:49] through me the same exact life that he
[1:34:51] had when he was on earth
[1:34:53] and if we examine ourselves this morning
[1:34:55] and it's not living out then something
[1:34:58] is wrong something wrong for nearly
[1:35:01] 2,000 years God had been making this
[1:35:06] masterpiece because he struck and he cut
[1:35:09] a master cut a piece off of him and cut
[1:35:12] a rib to make him a wife and now the
[1:35:13] perfect masterpiece that he struck at
[1:35:15] Calvary they got a piece off of him in
[1:35:17] in it's just the New Testament that's
[1:35:20] all he fulfilled the Old Testament but
[1:35:23] he said he struck a piece off of him at
[1:35:25] Calvary him in Alleluia you know where
[1:35:27] that piece was he said Oh in the New
[1:35:29] Testament there's another piece to be
[1:35:31] fulfilled a man he fulfilled the old
[1:35:33] test but there's another piece
[1:35:35] there's Bible times to be lived out
[1:35:36] right now he says he says see he was the
[1:35:40] old force in the new he says Christ come
[1:35:43] the masterpiece to fulfill the old now
[1:35:45] his bride now his bride how can you know
[1:35:48] that your bride his bride will fulfill
[1:35:50] everything that the two new testament
[1:35:52] says will be for this day another
[1:35:55] masterpiece in the making
[1:35:58] how many believes that this one would
[1:35:59] you stand your feet with me I pray that
[1:36:03] I wasn't too long I don't even know when
[1:36:04] I come out amen try it I tried not to be
[1:36:09] here this morning I mean another man's
[1:36:10] pulpit amen but brother Bram says you've
[1:36:13] got tapes upon how we are to babe if the
[1:36:15] spirit of God's in us we've got tapes
[1:36:18] how we are to behave ourselves how many
[1:36:20] know is that this maybe he says if the
[1:36:24] Spirit of God is in you you have got to
[1:36:26] come together because when the Spirit of
[1:36:29] God was hidden in return he said he
[1:36:32] found himself gathered together when the
[1:36:34] Spirit of God was in his samples they
[1:36:35] found himself gather together exhorting
[1:36:37] one another
[1:36:37] preaching building one enough he says
[1:36:39] even more so as you see the Day
[1:36:41] approaching yes so if you were only able
[1:36:44] to come

[1:36:54] call your neighbor get together with him
[1:36:56] I mean well the spirits in you that's
[1:36:59] what you'll desire him in there'll be a
[1:37:01] hunger and thirst for righteousness a
[1:37:03] man he said we've got to come together
[1:37:05] you can't you've got to come together to
[1:37:08] sit together in heavenly places in
[1:37:09] Christ Jesus you can't stay home if God
[1:37:11] is in your heart hey man there it is if
[1:37:13] God is in your heart you can't stay home
[1:37:16] he couldn't stay home a man if he's in

[1:37:21] we've got to be where that word of God
[1:37:23] is for why to preach our very lives to
