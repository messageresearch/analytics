[0:00] Okay,
[0:02] we're doing good by the grace of God.
[0:04] Let's be in the house of the Lord today.
[0:07] I'd like to go here if we could. Let's
[0:09] go to Job chapter 38.
[0:12] Brennon and I were talking about Job. I
[0:13] was telling a little about the book of
[0:15] Job we've been preaching. So hopefully
[0:17] this be a blessing again today.
[0:19] Wednesday night we looked at uh the
[0:20] thought of Job said, "I've heard uh but
[0:23] now I see." That's what brother Brian
[0:25] preached on last Sunday.
[0:28] Uh but I want to kind of pick up with
[0:30] God's questions for Job here. And uh I
[0:33] don't think I've ever preached through
[0:34] all these. So kind of felt uh burdened
[0:37] and led to look at some of these
[0:40] questions here by God's grace. Amen. Job
[0:44] 38.
[0:51] I'll read uh one, two, and three, and
[0:52] then we can all read uh verse four here
[0:55] by God's grace. Job 38 1-4.
[1:02] I'll read 1 through three and then we
[1:03] can read four together.
[1:05] The Bible says, "Then the Lord answered
[1:07] Job out of the whirlwind and said, Who
[1:10] is this that darkeneth counsel by words
[1:13] without knowledge? Gird up now thy loins
[1:16] like a man, for I will demand of thee,
[1:20] and answer thou me." Let's read verse
[1:22] four together. Ready? One, two, three.
[1:24] Where was thou when I laid the
[1:27] foundations of the earth? Declare if
[1:31] thou hast understanding. Amen. May God
[1:33] add the blessing to the to the reading
[1:35] of his word. You can be seated there.
[1:37] Hallelujah.
[1:40] Now, just so, Brother Brendan, just so
[1:41] you know, I usually preach about an hour
[1:42] and a half on Sunday. Now, that's a long
[1:44] sermon for a lot of people. I understand
[1:45] that. So, if you need to take a break,
[1:48] you just go as you're led. Okay,
[1:49] brother.
[1:50] We normally have two services on Sunday
[1:53] just because we love the word. Not
[1:54] because we have a big church, just
[1:55] because we we just love the word. But
[1:57] since we had a couple babies in the
[1:58] congregation, I've been giving the
[2:00] mothers little break there. And so
[2:02] because of that, I like to preach a
[2:03] little longer on Sunday morning. So, uh
[2:06] trust it'll be a blessing to everybody
[2:08] uh by the grace of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:12] So, Wednesday, we looked at Job uh we
[2:14] actually looked at Job chapter 42. So,
[2:16] if you have your Bible, why don't we
[2:17] just turn there to Job 42
[2:20] uh verse 5 is where we got our title
[2:22] from. Job 42:5 says, "I have heard of
[2:25] thee by the hearing of the ear, but now
[2:29] my eye seeth thee."
[2:32] And so, we picked it up there on
[2:34] Wednesday night and we just showed how
[2:36] how before Job was tested, he had never
[2:40] seen God in, we'd say, a very
[2:42] supernatural way. And a lot of us can
[2:44] probably relate to that. Uh maybe we
[2:46] never had like a major dream or uh maybe
[2:50] never felt like a supernatural presence
[2:52] around us during our childhood. I
[2:54] remember Lena's testimony that was
[2:55] something that she had testified of. I
[2:57] was the same. My wife, I'm sure, never
[2:59] really felt like this overwhelming
[3:01] powerful uh revelation. But yet, despite
[3:04] Job not having any of that, he'd heard
[3:08] the the word of God and there and then
[3:10] he applied it to his life. Right? We
[3:12] know this was probably before, you know,
[3:14] Job was probably the first ever recorded
[3:17] scripture about an individual. So this
[3:19] would have been before the flood as far
[3:21] as uh the timeline. And so his way to
[3:25] serve God, he learned was through blood
[3:26] sacrifice where he sacrificed animals.
[3:29] Praise God. And just in what he had
[3:31] heard, he was able to live and sacrifice
[3:34] to God so much where God starts bragging
[3:36] on him in heaven and said, "Satan, have
[3:39] you ever you considered my servant Job?
[3:41] There's no one like him in the earth. So
[3:44] that lets us know that we can live so
[3:46] close to God even without having all
[3:48] these signs, miracles, and wonders.
[3:51] &gt;&gt; Now, we all love signs, miracles, and
[3:53] wonders.
[3:54] &gt;&gt; Uh and just so you know, Brother Brian
[3:56] asked me last week to pray for his other
[3:58] hip. I had prayed for him in 2020, and
[4:01] God healed his hip supernaturally. He
[4:03] said, "But now the other one's in bad
[4:04] shape." So, I'm trusting in the Lord for
[4:06] another miracle. But it's up to God.
[4:08] That was a great sign or miracle in my
[4:11] life back in 2020. But now I got to
[4:14] trust God for another one. And if God
[4:15] doesn't do it, that's fine. The Lord
[4:17] gives and the Lord takes away. Blessed
[4:19] be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[4:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:23] &gt;&gt; But that was a great sign in my life. Uh
[4:25] I'd say around that time in my life. But
[4:27] we don't always have those all the time.
[4:30] But we get the we get the confirmation
[4:32] that God is looking at our hearts,
[4:35] right? And we get the confirmation from
[4:36] Jesus. He said it's more blessed to
[4:39] believe without seeing.
[4:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Lord told us that in the
[4:44] the book of John
[4:46] if you see great miracles and things
[4:48] that that's wonderful. But there comes a
[4:49] responsibility with that.
[4:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it takes less faith to
[4:54] believe after that. It takes more faith
[4:57] to believe without seeing any
[4:59] supernatural miracles. Now when I was
[5:01] eight years old, Brendon, I did see God
[5:02] heal my mom of cancer without any chemo.
[5:05] it just vanished one day. So, I saw that
[5:08] miracle myself. Uh, but it didn't
[5:10] involve me. Like, I didn't I didn't
[5:12] experience the healing. And so, I just I
[5:14] just saw her get better. I saw her get
[5:15] out of the hospital and all the bruises
[5:17] on her back vanished. And
[5:20] but I I I I couldn't say that I had not
[5:22] seen a miracle. Uh, now, as far as
[5:25] feeling the presence of God, I never
[5:26] really felt that. Uh, and so God tells
[5:29] Job uh or God lets us know about Job,
[5:32] he's a man. And what makes him special
[5:35] is he hates evil.
[5:37] &gt;&gt; That's what makes him really special in
[5:38] the sight of God. He hates evil. He
[5:41] tries to escue evil, which our word is
[5:44] depart from evil. Hallelujah. And so we
[5:47] saw that and and Job was daily
[5:49] confessing his sins, not just his sins,
[5:52] but the sins of his children. But Job
[5:54] 42:5 says, "I have heard of thee by the
[5:57] hearing of the ear, but now mine eye
[5:59] seeth thee. Wherefore I abhore myself
[6:01] and repent in dust in ashes. And I love
[6:05] this. I just love this fact. Whenever
[6:07] you experience God, it doesn't make you
[6:09] prideful. It makes you more humble.
[6:13] &gt;&gt; Job had an experience that very few
[6:15] people have ever had
[6:17] &gt;&gt; as far as having God talk to him so
[6:19] directly for so many verses, so many
[6:22] chapters. He directly hears from God. He
[6:24] sees God in a whirlwind. And it doesn't
[6:26] make him feel like, "Oh, I'm better than
[6:28] everybody else." It makes him feel
[6:30] humble.
[6:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And remember Jesus Christ is
[6:33] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[6:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:36] &gt;&gt; So if we experience, if one of us would
[6:39] experience something with the Lord
[6:40] Jesus, yes, it it would raise our faith,
[6:42] but it would also make us extremely
[6:44] humble
[6:45] &gt;&gt; where we'd realize, wow, I'm nothing.
[6:47] He's everything. I I'm just a vessel in
[6:50] his hand. He could do with me anything
[6:52] he wants, but he he's he's chosen to
[6:54] make me a vessel of honor. I have mercy
[6:56] in his sight. I ought to be so thankful.
[6:58] Praise God.
[6:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:59] &gt;&gt; I ought to be a privileged uh person and
[7:02] love and serve God with such a tender
[7:04] heart. Hallelujah.
[7:07] &gt;&gt; And then we saw that Job went through
[7:08] five layers of stress. I think I shared
[7:10] this with Brendan. He went through at
[7:12] least five layers of stress on
[7:13] Wednesday. Layers that we can't even
[7:16] fathom.
[7:17] He lost all of his money. So, he
[7:19] couldn't go to the bank and get any
[7:20] money. He lost He lost everything. Lost
[7:24] all his money. He lost all of his
[7:25] children over seven funerals on the same
[7:28] day.
[7:30] None of us can relate to that. Uh third,
[7:33] he lost all of his health. He went from
[7:35] perfect sound health to boils covering
[7:38] him from head to toe. He lost all of his
[7:40] sleep. He said he tossed and turned.
[7:42] When he laid down, he longed for the the
[7:45] morning, right? When when he's in the
[7:47] morning, he longed to lay down. And then
[7:48] he said, "When I did get sleep, alls I
[7:50] had was nightmares all night."
[7:52] So he never got any rest. No wonder he
[7:54] was in confusion. No wonder he said such
[7:57] harsh things against God. And yet in
[8:00] heaven, God's calling him the greatest.
[8:02] There's no one like Job. It just shows
[8:05] how God in heaven has so much mercy for
[8:08] us. In other words, God is
[8:08] predestinated. God knows his children in
[8:11] heaven. They know they're not going to
[8:12] fail the test. He knows they're going to
[8:14] pass the test. Hallelujah.
[8:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then the last layer was his
[8:18] trial didn't last a day or a week. It
[8:21] lasted months. Yeah,
[8:23] &gt;&gt; we go through difficult times. We might
[8:24] have a bad week, bad weekend, uh a bad
[8:27] uh two weeks, but he was going through
[8:30] months and months of this suffering. No
[8:32] let up in sight. And so, no wonder that
[8:35] he would say such harsh words. We saw
[8:38] that some of Job's words were right,
[8:40] some of them were wrong. Hallelujah. And
[8:43] we saw Elahu's words were all correct.
[8:46] Allah just rebuked Job over and over and
[8:48] over again. Showed him all these things
[8:49] where he was wrong. We looked at that on
[8:51] Wednesday night and then we closed uh
[8:53] Wednesday night. I think it was 2
[8:54] Chronicles 16:9. You want to pull that
[8:56] up there? I just advised the church to
[8:59] remember
[9:00] God's eyes run to and fro all around the
[9:03] earth. In other words, God's constantly
[9:05] watching you.
[9:07] &gt;&gt; Okay? And what does he want to do? The
[9:08] eyes of the Lord run to and fro
[9:10] throughout the earth to show himself
[9:11] strong in the behalf of them whose heart
[9:13] is perfect toward him. So God's
[9:16] searching this church this morning. Who
[9:18] can I show myself strong in?
[9:20] &gt;&gt; Who can I show that has a real
[9:22] testimony, a real heart that loves me?
[9:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And remember, we also know
[9:27] the other scripture in Job chapter 1.
[9:30] Satan was asked by God, "Where have you
[9:31] been?" He said, "I'm going to and fro
[9:33] along the earth." Right? In other words,
[9:35] trying to tempt people. So, we had that
[9:37] reality on Wednesday night. Both God and
[9:39] the devil and all the devil's spirits
[9:41] are going through around the earth
[9:43] trying to either God's either trying to
[9:45] find strong people or Satan's trying to
[9:47] bring down weak people.
[9:50] &gt;&gt; In other words, we're we're being
[9:51] watched at all times. Amen.
[9:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I think it says that in the
[9:55] gym, right? There's germs everywhere and
[9:56] there's Jesus everywhere. I think it
[9:58] says I like that sign.
[10:00] So, be be mindful of both. Amen. Clean
[10:03] up your natural germs and confess your
[10:05] sins. Hallelujah. Your spiritual germs.
[10:07] Let's read that just a reminder. Uh
[10:09] first John, go to first John chapter 1.
[10:11] Let's read that again about the
[10:12] certainty of the forgiveness of Jesus.
[10:15] First John chapter 1
[10:17] and then I just want to share again
[10:19] about David's testimony. It was such a
[10:21] blessing. I trust that you enjoyed that.
[10:23] Uh if you didn't if you weren't there, I
[10:25] you got to get that listen to that by
[10:27] God's grace. Uh look at verse uh 7. 1
[10:31] John 1:7. I just want you to look at the
[10:33] certainty of forgiveness.
[10:35] But if we walk in the light as he is in
[10:37] the light, so we choose to avoid the
[10:40] darkness, we have fellowship one with
[10:43] another. And the blood of Jesus Christ
[10:45] his son cleanses us from how much sin,
[10:47] church? Let's say it together? All. All.
[10:49] All. Everything. If you just keep
[10:53] walking in the light, then the blood of
[10:55] Christ will forgive you of all your sin.
[10:57] Well, well, Brother Jesse, I know, but I
[10:59] did it again last week and then this
[11:00] week and then I've done it for all these
[11:02] months and years. The Bible said he
[11:03] forgives you of all.
[11:07] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to bring that thought out.
[11:09] Brother David stood here as one of the
[11:11] most transparent testimonies I've heard
[11:14] where he was willing to admit I was
[11:16] raised around this message. In other
[11:17] words, the the Bible revelations for the
[11:19] end time. And I thought I was filled
[11:21] with the Holy Ghost. Look how humble he
[11:23] was to admit I realized I wasn't when I
[11:26] started getting drunk, smoking
[11:28] cigarettes, addicted to porn. Wasn't
[11:30] that a very honest testimony?
[11:33] &gt;&gt; I can give a lot of respect to a man
[11:35] like that or woman that would admit I
[11:38] thought I was born again, but when I got
[11:40] out in the world and I got tested, I
[11:41] realized I wasn't.
[11:43] &gt;&gt; But I love it. Amen. I love it. He said,
[11:46] but he didn't. He didn't want to stay
[11:47] that way.
[11:49] &gt;&gt; Pretty soon, sin wasn't pleasurable
[11:51] anymore. The Bible said sin is
[11:53] pleasurable for a season, but after a
[11:55] short season, it started being uh uh un
[11:58] unfavorable. It wasn't it lost its
[12:00] pleasure.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; And so he started crying out to God,
[12:02] church. Crying out to God. And remember,
[12:05] for years, he prayed to God. God,
[12:06] deliver me from these things. God,
[12:08] deliver me from porn. God, deliver me
[12:10] from these things. And church, according
[12:11] to the Bible, every time he asked for
[12:13] forgiveness, Jesus forgave him.
[12:15] Hallelujah.
[12:16] &gt;&gt; But down on earth, it took him, we'd
[12:18] say, months or we'd say a year, whatever
[12:20] more. Now, Adam was six years. Took him
[12:23] six years to finally overcome. But every
[12:25] time he said sorry, Jesus was faithful
[12:27] to forgive him.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Although it took him six years to
[12:32] overcome porn, he still got over it.
[12:34] Hallelujah.
[12:35] &gt;&gt; And he lives free from that today
[12:38] because greater is he that's in us than
[12:40] he that's in the world.
[12:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So let's just remember that.
[12:45] Now verse eight as well. If we say we
[12:47] have no sin, we deceive ourselves and
[12:50] the truth is not in us. Every day we
[12:52] battle sin. every day likely we might
[12:54] sin. So we must confess it. Verse nine,
[12:57] if we confess our sins, he's faithful
[12:59] and just to forgive us our sins and
[13:01] cleanse us from again all
[13:03] unrighteousness.
[13:05] If we say that we have not sin, we make
[13:07] him a liar and his word is not in us. So
[13:10] let's apply this to Job. Now we saw some
[13:13] of his sins. He had great fear about
[13:15] losing everything.
[13:18] &gt;&gt; Now did God forgive him of that? Of
[13:19] course, because God in heaven calls him
[13:22] perfect,
[13:24] &gt;&gt; but he battle with fear. I told that to
[13:25] Brennan. Sometimes I battle that too.
[13:27] You know, I'm gonna lose it all. I'm
[13:28] gonna lose my children. I'm going to
[13:29] lose my money. I'm going lose my job.
[13:31] I'm going to lose my health or I'm going
[13:32] to be in a wheelchair the rest of my
[13:33] life. Or, you know, we just battle
[13:34] different fears.
[13:36] &gt;&gt; But every time he had it, he confessed
[13:38] it. He did a blood sacrifice.
[13:40] Hallelujah. He worshiped God. And the
[13:42] Bible said God forgave him of that.
[13:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "I was at ease. I got lazy on
[13:47] God. God forgave him of that.
[13:49] Hallelujah.
[13:51] &gt;&gt; And he was prideful.
[13:53] He he said uh he said that God is not
[13:56] fair. God is not just. In other words,
[13:58] he said he's more he's a better judge
[14:00] than God. And God even forgave him of
[14:02] that.
[14:03] &gt;&gt; Church, just remember, I was looking
[14:05] earlier today. I don't have the notes,
[14:06] but many believers got angry at God, and
[14:09] God still forgave them.
[14:12] &gt;&gt; Job, we went through David a couple
[14:13] months ago. David got angry with God.
[14:16] Uh Jonah, he got angry with God. God,
[14:19] how could you spare Ninevites? They're
[14:21] so wicked. And God's like, you cared
[14:24] about a gourd. Why do you care about
[14:26] gourds and not about human souls?
[14:28] &gt;&gt; But that's God's prophet. Hallelujah.
[14:31] &gt;&gt; Like, it's normal for humans to get
[14:33] angry or it's normal for us to
[14:34] experience confusion and uncertainty,
[14:37] but when we realize we've made when we
[14:40] realize we said something wrong, may we
[14:42] go back to this verse and say, "God,
[14:44] forgive me. I'm confessing that I said
[14:46] things I didn't understand. Forgive me.
[14:48] Forgive all my sin
[14:50] &gt;&gt; through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[14:52] Hallelujah.
[14:54] Amen.
[14:56] So remember friends, God's spirit and
[14:58] Satan are going to and fro today.
[15:02] Hallelujah. And let's be a tool that God
[15:05] can use to show his strength today.
[15:07] Hallelujah. Now, before I get to Job's
[15:10] questions here, uh, that God gave to
[15:12] Job. Uh, let's remember, let's go back
[15:14] to, if we could, let's go back to Romans
[15:16] 8 here. Let's go to 8:31.
[15:22] And in caseia, I have a a slide here.
[15:24] We'll just put up here. It might make it
[15:25] a little easier. Back in the Romans
[15:28] series, remember the Romans series, I
[15:29] kind of preached on questions here.
[15:32] Beginning at verse 31,
[15:37] Paul says, "What shall we say to these
[15:40] things? If God be for us, who can be
[15:43] against us?"
[15:46] &gt;&gt; Now, like this is the chapter of God's
[15:48] love, I would say. Romans 8. I mean, so
[15:50] is 1 Corinthians 13. But, uh, this is a
[15:53] different view on God's love. Romans 8.
[15:55] There's no condemnation to them that are
[15:57] in Christ Jesus. That's verse number
[15:59] one. Hallelujah. And if it starts that
[16:00] good, it's only going to get better.
[16:02] Hallelujah.
[16:04] No condemnation, Brother Patrick.
[16:05] Hallelujah. To them that are in Christ
[16:06] Jesus, there's none.
[16:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Chris, there's no condemnation
[16:10] when you're in Christ Jesus.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; How are you in Christ Jesus? You have
[16:14] faith in his word.
[16:15] &gt;&gt; You're a child of God.
[16:18] &gt;&gt; So, if God's for me, who can be against
[16:19] me? Now, let's stop and look at Job. Did
[16:21] it always seem like God was for Job? It
[16:23] didn't seem like it, but God always was
[16:25] for Job.
[16:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:27] when he lost his children, lost his
[16:29] health, lost his money, it didn't seem
[16:30] like, well, God's for me. He actually
[16:32] questioned God.
[16:33] &gt;&gt; But the whole time, God was for him.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So, when we go through
[16:39] trials, let us not be tempted. The devil
[16:42] wants to try to make us think, "Oh,
[16:43] God's not for you, or this is going
[16:45] against you." Hey, I just say like this.
[16:47] If you have sin, confess it, and then
[16:48] you know God's for you. Praise God.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; Just confess any sin and any trial.
[16:53] Confess any sin and seek God. And I I
[16:56] believe God will show you your sin. You
[16:58] can confess it and then you know if
[16:59] you're being tested. It's just a test.
[17:02] &gt;&gt; It's to test your faith. It's to prove
[17:05] to the devil that you're a true
[17:07] believer.
[17:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He spared not his own son
[17:11] but delivered him up for us all. How
[17:14] shall he not with him also freely give
[17:16] us all things? Now if I asked you what
[17:20] would you like today? You might name
[17:22] some certain things to me and that might
[17:24] be true. But what does the Bible say?
[17:26] God gives us everything freely that we
[17:28] need spiritually.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; So every spiritual need you have, God
[17:33] has given to us.
[17:35] &gt;&gt; We just got to pray and believe it.
[17:37] Hallelujah.
[17:38] &gt;&gt; You might not get it the first day, the
[17:40] first week, the first month, but
[17:42] everything is freely given. Hallelujah.
[17:44] If you just confess your sins, keep
[17:46] trusting God, God's going to give you
[17:48] what you have need of.
[17:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I love verse 33. Who shall
[17:53] lay any charge to God's elect? It is God
[17:57] that justifieth.
[17:59] &gt;&gt; So think of Job there. Satan's trying to
[18:01] lay charges to Job and God's like he's
[18:03] perfect.
[18:05] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says those demons are
[18:07] there before God accusing us day and
[18:09] night.
[18:10] &gt;&gt; So think of think about that, brother
[18:11] Nia. There's demons accusing you day and
[18:13] night and me day and night. But who
[18:16] stands up for us? We're not even there
[18:17] to argue our case. Oh, thank God we have
[18:20] somebody to argue our case. Hallelujah.
[18:22] is Jesus Christ the righteous judge.
[18:25] &gt;&gt; He's called the advocate or the lawyer.
[18:28] And Jesus is there to say, "No, Jose,
[18:30] confess that. That's forgiven. I'm
[18:33] forgiving him of everything."
[18:35] Hallelujah.
[18:36] &gt;&gt; He's perfect. In other words, he escal.
[18:43] Amen. Not perfect like we never sin, but
[18:46] he's walking after the ways of God. He's
[18:48] a complete believer.
[18:50] And I like to put all your names in
[18:52] there as well, but time doesn't give me
[18:53] that. Hallelujah. Amen. Go to the next
[18:56] verse there. Verse 34. Oh, it's me.
[18:59] Sorry. Who is he that condemnth? You
[19:01] see, don't let the devils condemn you.
[19:04] Why would you let the devils condemn you
[19:05] when the Bible said there's nobody that
[19:07] can condemn you?
[19:10] &gt;&gt; It is Christ that died. So why am I not
[19:12] condemned? Because Jesus died for me.
[19:14] &gt;&gt; He paid my penalty. Hallelujah.
[19:17] &gt;&gt; I can't be condemned because he was
[19:18] condemned for me.
[19:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[19:20] &gt;&gt; All my sins were already paid for.
[19:23] &gt;&gt; It's already over with. I can't suffer
[19:25] for my sins because they're already paid
[19:27] for.
[19:29] &gt;&gt; In other words, my debt's already been
[19:30] paid. I don't owe God anything. Jesus
[19:33] paid it. Hallelujah.
[19:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:35] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[19:37] Yay. Rather that is risen again who is
[19:39] even at the right hand of God who al
[19:41] also maketh intercession for us. Amen.
[19:44] There's somebody there before God to
[19:47] make intercession to God for what we
[19:49] have need of.
[19:50] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you have somebody in
[19:51] heaven, brother Mercy? You have somebody
[19:54] in heaven waiting for you to make
[19:56] intercession for your prayer requests.
[19:59] &gt;&gt; What a confidence we should have in our
[20:01] prayers. Hallelujah.
[20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; That's the reason Jesus is there because
[20:05] he wants to hear our prayers.
[20:08] &gt;&gt; He's there for us. Let's say for us. Can
[20:11] we for us? He's there for us. Jesus sits
[20:14] at the right hand of God for us to make
[20:18] intercession for our requests.
[20:21] &gt;&gt; What a promise. Verse 35. Who shall
[20:23] separate us from the love of Christ? So
[20:26] again, these are rhetorical questions.
[20:28] When God wants us to understand
[20:29] something, he asks us questions.
[20:32] Hallelujah.
[20:33] Is there anything that can separate us
[20:35] from the love of Christ? No. Nothing.
[20:38] So, think of the think of Satan or the
[20:40] worst demon or the worst temptation or
[20:43] the worst trial on earth like Job went
[20:45] through. Could that trial losing all
[20:47] your money, all your children, all your
[20:48] health, could that separate him from
[20:50] God's love? Impossible. Hallelujah.
[20:54] Nothing can separate us from the love of
[20:56] God which is in Christ Jesus.
[20:58] Hallelujah. So, we have to we have to
[21:00] realize if we don't feel loved, then we
[21:02] need to get a closer walk with God. We
[21:04] got to go talk to Jesus about his love
[21:07] for us. Hallelujah.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; I'm convinced, church, that's the only
[21:10] reason we stumble is because we lose our
[21:12] fellowship with God. But when we come
[21:14] back to God, the fellowship's restored
[21:16] and then we love Jesus more. We don't
[21:18] want to sin.
[21:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:22] That's right.
[21:24] Shall tribulation separated from the
[21:26] love of Jesus, distress, persecution,
[21:30] famine, nakedness, peril, or sword? As
[21:33] it is written, for thy sake, we are
[21:35] killed all the day long. We are counted
[21:37] for sheep for the slaughter. So, can any
[21:39] of those things separate us from the
[21:41] love of God? The answer is no.
[21:43] Hallelujah. In other words, the love of
[21:45] Jesus is with us. Hallelujah. Not only
[21:48] is it with us, the Bible says it's in
[21:50] us.
[21:51] Now, I'm going to try to speed up here a
[21:53] little bit. Nay, in all these things, we
[21:54] are more than conquerors through him
[21:56] that loved us. In other words, so
[21:58] friends, you are going to conquer
[21:59] tribulations in your life.
[22:01] &gt;&gt; You're going to conquer distress,
[22:03] anxiety, fear. You're going to con
[22:05] conquer persecution. A lot of you have
[22:07] already done it. Amen. Hallelujah.
[22:10] Glory. Famine. Thank God we haven't had
[22:12] that. Uh nakedness, very few clothes,
[22:15] peril or sword, even wars, right? We the
[22:18] Bible says we are we will conquer those
[22:20] things because in all these things he
[22:23] loves us throughout all these things.
[22:27] &gt;&gt; I just want everybody to take a fresh
[22:28] look at your trials that you're going
[22:30] through today.
[22:32] If we look at Job and see God's love in
[22:35] his trials, well then surely if our
[22:37] trials aren't as difficult as that,
[22:39] surely we can see God's love in our
[22:41] trials today.
[22:42] &gt;&gt; Job said, "I've heard, but now I see." A
[22:46] lot of us are just going to hear. But
[22:47] may God help us to see the truth of this
[22:49] word today.
[22:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[22:53] &gt;&gt; For I'm persuaded that neither death, so
[22:55] if we lost any loved ones recently,
[22:57] especially these families that have lost
[22:58] fathers at 40, 45, death, life, angels,
[23:03] principalities, powers, things present,
[23:07] uh, things nor things to come, nor
[23:09] height, nor depth, nor any other
[23:10] creature shall be able to separate us
[23:13] from the love of God, which is in Christ
[23:15] Jesus our Lord.
[23:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nothing can separate us from the
[23:21] love of God.
[23:23] Amen.
[23:25] Now, I want to re re let's review uh
[23:29] when I preach this in the Romans series.
[23:32] Remember we went over the Socratic
[23:33] method. It's a teaching method where and
[23:36] I had a teacher like this in uh in
[23:38] college. He was a great teacher. Can't
[23:41] think of his last name right now. Oh
[23:43] yeah, Dr. Broadway. When I was in
[23:45] University of Akran, he taught this way.
[23:47] He never said anything unless it was a
[23:49] question.
[23:51] Those are some really interesting
[23:52] classes. That's an hour and a half of
[23:53] just questions.
[23:56] Uh it was very it was very challenging.
[23:59] Okay. Uh and of course it comes from
[24:01] Socrates, the the great philosopher. Uh
[24:04] but I'm just going to skip ahead just
[24:05] because it's review. What's the whole
[24:07] point of this? What's the benefit? It
[24:09] encourages students to explore your own
[24:11] thoughts and your own beliefs.
[24:14] See, a lot happens when you're asked a
[24:16] question. You have to go deep down
[24:18] inside or we'd say deep down inside for
[24:20] the answer. And it shows us what's
[24:22] inside of us. If I asked you, Lydia
[24:25] asked a student last week uh what's 5*
[24:27] 5? What I think he said what 45 or
[24:30] something like that. Now look, there's a
[24:32] question and it brought out the wrong
[24:34] answer.
[24:36] Hallelujah. So see questions show what's
[24:40] inside of us.
[24:42] Praise God. So during those, you know,
[24:45] college courses, you know, all those
[24:47] classes, I really found out I don't know
[24:49] too much about teaching. I don't know a
[24:51] whole lot about history. I don't know
[24:52] much about anything really.
[24:55] It's very humbling when you're asked a
[24:57] lot of questions. It's a humbling thing
[24:58] when you get the wrong when you get the
[25:00] wrong answer. I'll say it like that,
[25:01] right? But when you're asked lots of
[25:04] questions, you have to explore yourself.
[25:06] What do I know about algebra, Claude?
[25:08] What do I know about algebra? What I
[25:10] know about college math?
[25:13] It helps you explore your thoughts and
[25:15] you consider how these thoughts and
[25:16] beliefs may contribute to assumptions
[25:18] about the topic at hand. So you find out
[25:21] what's inside of you and you also
[25:22] understand your weaknesses.
[25:25] You understand, oh, I assumed wrong
[25:27] about this. Well, I thought Pluto was a
[25:30] planet. Now they say it's not. Then it
[25:32] goes back to it is a planet. You might
[25:34] swing back and forth and I just assumed
[25:36] it was. So questions bring out what's uh
[25:40] what's inside of us. So now let's go
[25:43] back to Job 38 where we started. Job 38.
[25:46] Kind of going the roundabout way here.
[25:50] Yeah. God's questions for Job.
[25:58] Now, as I've studied this, it seems God
[26:00] and Elahu asked Job over 75 questions.
[26:05] Now, Job on Earth was he was telling his
[26:07] three friends, "If I could just talk to
[26:09] to God, if I could just uh see him face
[26:12] to face, if there was just someone to go
[26:14] between us, if there was just somebody
[26:17] that that that I could talk to and God
[26:19] and plead my case." In other words, I'm
[26:21] just dying to talk to God.
[26:24] &gt;&gt; Did God answer his prayer?
[26:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:28] But when God comes down to Job, God
[26:30] starts with questions.
[26:33] And if you read through the 75
[26:34] questions, God never answered Job's
[26:37] questions.
[26:39] So catch this. Sometimes we we so bad
[26:42] want to hear from God. But what if he
[26:44] doesn't answer our question? Will we
[26:46] still trust him?
[26:49] &gt;&gt; Is hearing from him enough or does he
[26:51] specifically have to answer our question
[26:54] and give us what we want in order to be
[26:56] happy?
[26:58] &gt;&gt; Shows us how selfish we are sometimes.
[27:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:02] So shows that sometimes we we don't
[27:04] understand God like we think we do,
[27:06] right? Like we say we do. And Job finds
[27:09] out here that he doesn't quite
[27:11] understand God at all. Hallelujah.
[27:15] So it's a good lesson for us to learn.
[27:18] The first question we read it was verse
[27:21] uh verse two. Job 382. I'm sorry. I'm on
[27:25] the wrong page. Who is this that
[27:27] darkeneth counsel by words without
[27:29] knowledge? So God comes down to talk to
[27:31] him and he says, "Who is this?"
[27:35] It'd be like if you come up for prayer,
[27:37] it'd be just like this. You come up for
[27:38] prayer. Uh, pastor, can you pray for me?
[27:40] I said, 'Who are you? I don't even know
[27:43] you.
[27:44] &gt;&gt; Now, how would you feel if I did that?
[27:46] I'm leaving the church, man. You have a
[27:48] right to You have a right. If I treated
[27:51] you like that, you have a right to leave
[27:52] the church
[27:53] &gt;&gt; because I'm not God.
[27:55] But God has a right to do whatever he
[27:57] wants.
[27:59] Hallelujah.
[28:01] &gt;&gt; Now, thank God I've never done that to
[28:02] anybody. I don't plan to start that
[28:04] either. But he says, "Who is this?" Yet
[28:08] up in heaven, he's bragging, "Do you
[28:09] know Job? I know Job. Job's a perfect
[28:12] man. No one's like Job." Hallelujah.
[28:14] Praise God. Amen. There's nobody like
[28:17] him. But on earth, when God's correcting
[28:20] his child, sometimes he got to gives us
[28:22] rebukes.
[28:23] &gt;&gt; Who is this?
[28:25] Who are you? He's not even talking up to
[28:28] him. He says, "Who is this?" He didn't
[28:30] even say, "Who are you?" He said, "Who
[28:31] is this?"
[28:34] So, God knows how to humble us, church.
[28:36] And that's what God wanted, brother
[28:38] Jose. God wanted God wanted to see this
[28:40] humility come out in Job chapter 42. I
[28:43] abhore myself. I repent. I've said
[28:46] things that I did not understand what I
[28:48] was saying.
[28:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:52] &gt;&gt; So, verse two, we get the first
[28:54] question. So, he's rebuked for his
[28:56] knowledge. He's got the He's got bad
[28:58] knowledge. He's got misunderstanding.
[29:00] Verse four, where was thou when I laid
[29:02] the foundations of the earth? That's a
[29:04] very good first question.
[29:06] How did the earth get here?
[29:09] What was it founded upon? What's holding
[29:11] up the earth? Uh, air. Gravity. What's
[29:16] gravity? Who made gravity?
[29:20] Oh, these are some good questions here.
[29:22] Hallelujah. Verse five. Who laid the
[29:25] measures thereof? and knowest thou? In
[29:27] other words, what are the measurements
[29:28] of the earth? Now, now we know it by uh
[29:31] uh by all the the telescopes and what
[29:34] are those uh satellites there? I can't
[29:36] remember the word. Now, we know it by
[29:38] satellites, but do we trust those? Are
[29:40] those always right?
[29:42] I mean, we're just we're just taking it
[29:43] by faith, right? We're just blind faith,
[29:45] really.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; Verse five again. Or hast thou stretched
[29:51] the line upon it? Did you get out the
[29:52] measuring tape and measure the earth?
[29:54] Did you know how big it is? Job.
[29:57] Verse six, whereupon are the foundations
[30:00] fastened thereof. So when you build a
[30:01] house, you know, Malachi seen it. You
[30:03] got to lay the you got to lay the
[30:06] foundation, the footer. You got to you
[30:08] got to fasten the walls first. You know,
[30:09] when the walls go up, you got to fasten
[30:10] them in the place. God asked Job who put
[30:14] the fastenings on the earth to make sure
[30:15] it stayed in place because that's all he
[30:17] knew. He knew about fastenings and and
[30:19] his city and he knew about his home and
[30:21] all his barns and everything that he
[30:22] had. He was a great man.
[30:24] So he asked him about the earth. Verse
[30:26] six, or who laid the cornerstone
[30:27] thereof? What's the cornerstone of the
[30:29] earth?
[30:31] Verse 12, hast thou commanded the
[30:33] morning since the days? Did you send the
[30:35] Did you start the morning sunrise this
[30:36] morning? Were you able to do that?
[30:40] How do you think Job's feeling after
[30:42] just like five or six questions? Verse
[30:44] 12. And the causing the daypring to know
[30:47] his place. I didn't Oh, that's the dawn.
[30:49] The dayring is the dawn. Do you know
[30:52] where the dawn's place is? Where it
[30:54] waits in order to come forth in the
[30:56] morning? Where's the dawn's place? I
[30:59] didn't know the dawn had a place.
[31:01] Verse 16. Hast thou entered into the
[31:04] springs of the seas? You know there's
[31:05] there's springs inside the sea where
[31:07] water comes forth and springs forth
[31:10] causes all these ocean currents. Job
[31:13] didn't know where that was.
[31:16] He's saying on earth, he's saying, "I
[31:17] demand to talk to God. I want to talk to
[31:19] God." Okay, now you're talking to God.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; How's it going, Job? You like this talk
[31:25] so far?
[31:27] God's not God's not addressing his pain.
[31:30] Now, that's where it's hard for us.
[31:31] God's not addressing his suffering.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; God is trying to get him to see out of
[31:36] his four walls, we'd say, right?
[31:38] &gt;&gt; Or his tunnel vision. Look outside this
[31:44] just go to the earth. Now, he's going to
[31:45] take him up to the heavenlies pretty
[31:46] soon by God's grace.
[31:48] Hallelujah.
[31:51] He starts there on the earth. Then he
[31:53] goes to the sea. How about verse 16? Or
[31:56] hast thou walked in the search of the
[31:58] depth? How deep is the ocean, Job?
[32:01] And then he gets to this question. Verse
[32:03] 17. Have the gates of death been opened
[32:05] unto thee?
[32:08] Right? We know the gates of hell, right?
[32:09] There's gates of hell in the heart of
[32:11] the earth. And uh God told Job, "Have
[32:14] they been open to you?"
[32:17] No. Of course not. Verse 17. Or hast
[32:19] thou seen the doors of the shadows of
[32:21] death?
[32:23] The doors of the shadows of death
[32:26] entering into death. Have you seen that?
[32:29] Verse 18. Hast thou perceive the breath
[32:32] of the earth. So he goes back to the
[32:33] earth.
[32:35] Earth, sea, death. Back to the earth.
[32:38] Verse 18. Declare if thou knowest it
[32:41] all.
[32:44] Because before he's saying, I'm greater
[32:45] than God. I've been more fair than God.
[32:47] I know more than God. So now God's like,
[32:49] "Okay, tell me all of that that you know
[32:53] so much about God. Why am I suffering?
[32:55] Why is my life so hard? Why is this bad
[32:57] in my family? Why is that bad in this
[32:59] financial situation? Why is my health
[33:01] like this?" And God's like, "Tell me all
[33:03] of all of this and then I'll talk to you
[33:05] about that."
[33:07] He's sick. He suffered for months. He's
[33:10] not sleeping good. God, why aren't I
[33:11] sleeping good? You better be careful
[33:13] what God's going to answer you. Be
[33:14] careful of what God might answer you. It
[33:17] might not be what you want to hear, but
[33:19] it will humble you and it will help you
[33:22] to trust in God more.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:26] Verse 19, where is the way where light
[33:28] dwelleth? The way light dwells.
[33:33] Verse 19, as for darkness, wherefore is
[33:36] the place thereof. Where does darkness
[33:37] go when light is where does darkness go
[33:40] to wait?
[33:42] It's breaking into light.
[33:45] Let's go down to verse 22. Hast thou
[33:47] entered into the treasures of the snow?
[33:49] The storehouses. So God says there's
[33:52] storehouses of snow.
[33:54] Have you entered into those where God
[33:57] keeps storehouses? He's got all this
[33:59] snow piled up ready to go.
[34:03] Job doesn't know where that is. Or hast
[34:04] thou seen the treasures of the hail? The
[34:06] storehouses of hail. Where does the hail
[34:09] get kept in store to pour uh pounds and
[34:12] pounds or inches and inches of hail?
[34:14] Where's that all kept at? God asked Job.
[34:17] Job doesn't know.
[34:19] By what way is the light pardon? In
[34:21] verse 24, which scatterth the east wind
[34:24] upon the earth? So now he breaks into
[34:26] the wind,
[34:27] light, wind, earth, death, sea. Verse
[34:32] 25, who hath divided a water course or a
[34:35] trench for the overflowing of water.
[34:37] See, whenever there's floods, there's
[34:38] got to be a place where it eventually is
[34:40] stopped, where it's held. And God said,
[34:42] "Did you provide that water course? Did
[34:44] you put that trench there to hold the
[34:46] overflow?"
[34:48] No. Job didn't. Job couldn't handle the
[34:50] floods either. Couldn't handle the rain.
[34:53] Verse 25. Or away for the lightning of
[34:56] thunder.
[34:58] Do you know how to send thunder? Do you
[34:59] know how to make it lightning?
[35:02] Good question. Verse 28, hath the rain
[35:04] of father? Is that how all those
[35:06] raindrops come? Because a dad a dad just
[35:09] keeps having rain children, right? This
[35:12] is God's question for him. All these
[35:13] raindrops, do they have a dad?
[35:16] I don't know about that.
[35:21] I love verse 28. You know, this morning
[35:22] I walked out and to to just give the
[35:24] chickens some leftover food after I got
[35:27] up. Who hath begotten the dos the drops
[35:29] of dew? My shoes, as you know, your
[35:31] shoes get covered in the dew. You just
[35:33] take a little stroll out there. Tell the
[35:35] chickens good morning. God bless you
[35:36] chickens. I come back. My feet are
[35:38] soaking wet. Each one of those dew
[35:40] drops, God asked Job, "Did you do that?
[35:44] Can you do that? Can you put all those
[35:45] down there?"
[35:47] "Well, I'm just just trying to
[35:48] understand my situation, God."
[35:52] God's like, "Consider all this around
[35:54] you. You haven't considered how great I
[35:57] am." In other words, church, we can't
[35:59] let God become little to us. We don't
[36:01] serve a little God. We serve an infinite
[36:04] God
[36:06] &gt;&gt; who's in control of the storehouses of
[36:08] hail, the storehouses of snow. He's got
[36:10] all that dew up there, Brother Austin,
[36:12] just waiting to bring it down so we can
[36:15] enjoy a morning walking out in the
[36:16] grass. Dew all over our feet.
[36:21] Let's uh How about this one? Verse 29.
[36:23] Out of whose womb came the ice? So,
[36:25] who's the ice's mother?
[36:29] Go down to verse 31. I think I got some
[36:31] pictures here I'll share with.
[36:34] All right, I got a few pictures here. By
[36:35] God's grace,
[36:37] verse 31. Can't thou bind the sweet
[36:40] influence of Plleades? I might be saying
[36:42] that wrong. Am I saying that right?
[36:44] Anybody done any astronomy lately?
[36:46] Pleaides.
[36:49] Now, Plletes is a constellation of seven
[36:51] stars.
[36:53] So, let me read about these here just
[36:55] briefly. Oh, yeah. Before I read that,
[36:57] um, the speed of light is 186,282
[37:02] miles per second.
[37:05] Per second. That's a almost 200,000
[37:07] miles per second.
[37:10] And a light year
[37:13] uh that a light travels in one year is
[37:14] almost 6 trillion miles that light
[37:17] travels in one year.
[37:20] So I just want to lay this down before
[37:21] we get to some of these stars here.
[37:24] So for example, if we say a star is 444
[37:27] light years away like Pleaides, that
[37:30] means the light that we see today left
[37:33] those stars 440 years ago
[37:37] and we're just seeing it today.
[37:40] God starts breaking into these space
[37:43] questions.
[37:45] Got any we got any NASA scientists in
[37:47] here that might be able to answer some
[37:48] of these questions?
[37:50] I didn't think so. So Pletes is seven
[37:54] stars.
[37:55] God says can thou can thou bind the
[37:58] sweet influences of Pletes? Never never
[38:02] can say that right.
[38:04] So the modern name is Messier if I'm not
[38:07] mistaken. It's a constellation in
[38:08] Taurus. It's about 444 light years away.
[38:13] It has over 1,000 stars. So that's Ple
[38:16] Pleaides. Now I brought this because I
[38:18] like this because I I can always find
[38:19] Orion in the winter time because I
[38:21] always look for those three stars right
[38:23] there. So if you just follow that up to
[38:26] this one and you'll find Pleaides. Now
[38:28] I've never found that, but I had to find
[38:29] this one in college. So I remember that
[38:31] one. That's the only one I can remember
[38:32] from my college years.
[38:36] So it's 1,000 stars. Only six or seven
[38:39] are visible to the naked eye.
[38:45] Hallelujah. So this is a cluster.
[38:47] Ancients saw this as seven sisters. So
[38:50] God said, "Can you bind those and bring
[38:52] them all together like I did? Can you
[38:56] control the stars? Can you move the
[38:57] stars around wherever you want? Create
[38:59] all these beautiful constellations."
[39:02] Then he says, "Or loose the bands of of
[39:04] Orion." So the maybe the bands the stars
[39:06] that are closest together. Can you loose
[39:08] those and cause those to move?
[39:11] Of course not. It's one of the most
[39:13] recognizable constellations is Orion.
[39:16] It's 1,200 light years away.
[39:20] So that means the light that we see left
[39:23] 1,200 years ago that we're just seeing
[39:26] it now. Hallelujah.
[39:30] Beetlejuice is one of those stars. It's
[39:33] 1,000 times the size of the sun. Do you
[39:36] think Job knew that? That's just more
[39:38] recent information.
[39:41] God's asking you, can you break those up
[39:43] and kind of move those around?
[39:47] They're a thousand times the size of the
[39:49] sun.
[39:52] But God, I'm suffering. But God, I
[39:54] haven't slept well. But God, I have
[39:56] family trouble. But God, I'm I'm out of
[39:59] finances. Job could have said all that.
[40:01] And God said, can you handle Orion?
[40:04] Have you thought about ple pleades?
[40:09] Where's the storehouses of snow and
[40:10] hail? Where where they at, Job? But God,
[40:13] I'm sick. I'm tired. I I don't have any
[40:16] money. my family. I've lost everything.
[40:18] God doesn't talk about that.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; God's getting him to see how great he
[40:22] is. Amen. God is fixing to give him a
[40:24] comeback. Brother Austin. Amen.
[40:26] Hallelujah. Praise God. Just like we saw
[40:28] with the wrestling matches a few weeks
[40:30] ago, we don't wrestle against flesh and
[40:32] blood. Hallelujah. God's humbling him in
[40:35] order to get him uh to to realize how
[40:38] little he is in order to give him a
[40:40] comeback so he'll serve God with more
[40:43] zeal, more passion. Hallelujah. more
[40:45] diligence in the second part of his life
[40:47] than he did the first part of his life.
[40:49] Hallelujah.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; And church, that's what you'll find. If
[40:52] you can accept God's correction, if you
[40:54] can accept God's suffering for you to go
[40:56] through, you'll come out a better
[40:58] Christian on the other side.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; You will love God more.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; You will thank him more. You'll talk
[41:04] about him more. You'll read your Bible
[41:05] more. As Brendon's been tearing through
[41:07] those scriptures, you'll just you'll
[41:09] love it more
[41:11] &gt;&gt; because God showed up and he showed me
[41:13] things about me. He exposed my
[41:15] weaknesses and he showed me how great he
[41:18] is. So, he's more worthy to be praised
[41:20] than I imagined.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; I thought I knew something about God. I
[41:23] found out I don't know much about God.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, Mazareth, look at Maza
[41:29] Mazareth. Mazeroth
[41:31] was the entire set of the Hebrew zodiac.
[41:35] So God said, "Can you bring forth ma
[41:37] mazeroth in a season?" It was all of
[41:40] these. It was Aries, Tarsus, Gemini,
[41:42] Cancer, all these constellations. God
[41:45] asked Job, "Can you bring them in their
[41:47] right season that they're supposed to
[41:48] come in?" Uh, I'll start working on
[41:50] that.
[41:54] So, first he started with just a couple
[41:55] constellations. Then he goes through all
[41:57] of them. Are you going to bring out all
[41:59] those so the star watchers can see it,
[42:02] look for signs, and pray and do all
[42:04] these things? Are you going to bring
[42:05] that out?
[42:07] In other words, are you going to make
[42:08] the world turn? Are you going to bring
[42:10] all the stars in the right place, the
[42:11] right situations? The answer is no.
[42:16] God's going to take care of that.
[42:18] And remember, church, some of those are
[42:20] a thousand times bigger than the sun.
[42:26] God knows how to humble his people.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Anybody been humbled this week?
[42:33] Anybody been prideful this week? If if
[42:34] you've been prideful this week, then
[42:36] this is a good sermon to humble you.
[42:38] Hallelujah. Me too. Arcturus, canst thou
[42:41] guide
[42:43] Arcturus with his sons?
[42:47] So this uh location is about 37 light
[42:50] years away. It's one of the closest
[42:52] bright stars to Earth. It has an orange
[42:56] giant uh star which is 25 times the size
[42:59] of the sun. So not not very big compared
[43:02] to Beetlejuice and 170 times more
[43:05] luminous.
[43:09] Okay. So there's Arc Tourus. So if you
[43:10] find the Big Dipper, I guess for us, if
[43:13] from this view, you'd follow it uh to
[43:16] the east of the Big Dipper, you find Arc
[43:19] Taus.
[43:21] So God said, "Do you guide that star?
[43:25] Do you put that in its right place? Do
[43:26] you make sure it's right east of the Big
[43:28] Dipper? Did you put that there?" Uh the
[43:31] answer is no.
[43:34] And church, if we can't control that,
[43:36] how much more can we control the events
[43:37] of our life?
[43:41] You know, uh,
[43:43] you know, sometimes in life, we we we so
[43:45] want control of our lives,
[43:48] &gt;&gt; right? I just want to get up and I want
[43:49] to have control of this and I want
[43:51] control of that and I want control of
[43:52] that. And God's showing Job, I've got it
[43:54] all under control.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; I'm the one who controls all this. And
[43:59] if I control all this, you can trust me
[44:02] that I allow this to happen. I allowed
[44:04] that to happen. I'm worthy of your
[44:07] trust.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; But I'm sick, God. Trust me. But I'm low
[44:13] on money. God says, "Trust me.
[44:17] I've got everything under control."
[44:19] Hallelujah. Praise God. You can trust me
[44:21] with your your life. Hallelujah.
[44:26] Now, I'm going to skip ahead just for
[44:28] time sake. I don't even know how long
[44:29] I've been preaching. I didn't set the
[44:30] timer, so I apologize.
[44:32] In this chapter 38, he goes even into
[44:35] more things about knowledge. Verse 36,
[44:38] who hath put wisdom in the inward parts?
[44:40] So, Job, did you give these children
[44:41] their their intellect? Of course not.
[44:46] Uh, verse 37, I like that question. Who
[44:48] can number the clouds in wisdom? Can you
[44:51] count all the clouds up there?
[44:54] Or who can stay the bottles of heaven?
[44:56] So the rain. Do you know where the all
[44:59] the bottles are in heaven that hold all
[45:00] the rain?
[45:03] Then he breaks down to the earth. Verse
[45:05] 39. Wilt thou hunt the prey for the
[45:07] lion?
[45:10] The lions need food. Are you going to
[45:12] show them their prayer? You going to get
[45:13] the prey the food for them? Or will you
[45:16] feel the appetite of the young lions?
[45:18] Church. We have hard enough time feeding
[45:20] our animals. It's a real work to feed
[45:22] dogs.
[45:24] Feeding all those dogs in the morning.
[45:26] Well, God's like, Job, have you
[45:27] considered all the lion cubs out there?
[45:29] You want to go feed all the lion cubs?
[45:31] You going to take care of that?
[45:33] Verse 41, who provideth raven for his
[45:36] food? All the birds, you provide food
[45:38] for them.
[45:40] Hallelujah.
[45:42] Chapter 39, he speaks of the wild goats.
[45:44] In verse one, knowest thou the time when
[45:47] the wild goats of the rock bring forth?
[45:49] What time do they have children
[45:51] throughout the year? They're up in the
[45:52] mountains in the rocks. What time do
[45:54] they have what time of year do they have
[45:56] kids?
[45:59] Verse two, can't thou number the months
[46:01] that they fulfill? How many months does
[46:04] that take? Job doesn't know.
[46:08] Now, like the unicorn, the unicorn's
[46:10] probably a wild ox that's now extinct
[46:13] because there's uh fossil records. It's
[46:15] called the I can't say it, but it's
[46:17] called the Arox. Verse 39. Will the
[46:20] unicorn be willing to serve thee? So
[46:21] there was some wild ox that were so
[46:23] great they couldn't even tame them. Now
[46:25] God's about to break into the biggest
[46:27] animals that were ever on the earth. So
[46:30] Job can finally understand if I made
[46:32] these, how much greater am I than my
[46:35] creation?
[46:40] So he talks about the ox for all the
[46:42] verses down to verse 12. And then he
[46:44] breaks into the horse in verse 19. Hast
[46:46] thou given the horse strength?
[46:50] Verse 19. Hast thou clothe his neck with
[46:52] thunder?
[46:54] Verse 26. Doth the hawk fly by thy
[46:58] wisdom? Did you teach the hawk to fly?
[47:01] But God, I'm sick. But God, everything's
[47:03] falling apart in my life. Did you teach
[47:04] the hawk to fly?
[47:07] In other words, look outside your
[47:09] situation.
[47:11] Look outside of your pain. Look outside
[47:13] of your suffering. God's greater than
[47:15] all of it. Hallelujah. I like verse 27.
[47:19] Doth the eagle mount up at at thy
[47:21] command and make her nest on high?
[47:25] Do you tell the an the eagles when to
[47:27] fly really high? Soar.
[47:30] Do you command them?
[47:33] Hallelujah.
[47:35] Now in verse chapter 40, let's go to
[47:36] chapter 40.
[47:40] Verse one. Moreover, the Lord answered
[47:42] Job and said, "Now God's not done. God
[47:46] has rebuked him through all these areas
[47:48] up to the up to the planets down to hell
[47:51] itself down to the depths of the sea.
[47:53] God's rebuked him on all these things.
[47:55] And God's not done yet. I tell you, when
[47:57] God does something, he does it right,
[47:59] brother Brendan. If he's going to rebuke
[48:01] you, he's really going to rebuke us.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; God knows how to do it.
[48:06] If all those weren't enough, he's still
[48:08] not done.
[48:10] Now, look what he says in verse two.
[48:12] Shall he that contendeth with the
[48:14] Almighty instruct him? He's talking
[48:17] about Job. God was fighting with God.
[48:20] I'm sorry. Job was fighting with God.
[48:22] And Job was trying to instruct God. God,
[48:24] this is a better way to do it. My way is
[48:27] the better way to do it. Have we ever
[48:29] said that to God? Well, God, you should
[48:31] have did it this way. I wish you would
[48:33] have healed that person. Or you should
[48:35] have done You should have gave me the
[48:36] Holy Ghost there. I should have got
[48:38] saved there so I didn't go through that.
[48:40] Church, God knows what we have to go
[48:41] through.
[48:47] He that reproveth God, let him answer.
[48:50] So after all these 40 some questions,
[48:53] God says, now what's your answer? I've
[48:56] asked you all these questions. Glory
[48:59] about wild oxins. Hallelujah.
[49:02] About eagles and hawks,
[49:04] the depths of the sea, snow, hail, the
[49:07] stars, constellations about death, even
[49:09] death and hell itself. I've asked you
[49:11] all these questions. What is your
[49:14] answer?
[49:15] Verse three. Then Job answered the Lord
[49:17] and said, "Behold, I'm the greatest of
[49:19] all time." Is that what he said? I'm
[49:21] checking your reading.
[49:24] No, he said, "Behold, let's say it
[49:25] together. Behold, I am vile." Now, that
[49:28] means little and in insignificant. It
[49:30] doesn't mean sinful. Of course, we know
[49:32] we're all sinful. We have a sin nature.
[49:34] He said, "God, I'm vile. I'm just a real
[49:36] insignificant thing on the earth.
[49:41] Oh, wait, wait. Aren't you going to give
[49:42] me those measurements for the earth,
[49:43] Job? I'm waiting. What? How many uh
[49:45] meters long is around is the earth? You
[49:47] going to give me those measurements?
[49:50] No. His only answer is, I'm small. I'm
[49:53] nothing. Does that sound familiar to
[49:54] anybody? Hallelujah.
[49:56] When we go through suffering, what does
[49:58] it boil down to? God, forgive me. I
[49:59] don't know what I'm talking about. I'm
[50:01] complaining. God, help me not to
[50:02] complain. Help me to praise you in the
[50:04] midst of my trial.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; I don't have it that bad.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. We got it good. Of
[50:10] anybody in the earth, we've got it the
[50:11] best. Hallelujah.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Yet, we still complain or may feel sorry
[50:15] for ourselves. We have self-pity. God
[50:17] forgive us. God, help us to say, Lord,
[50:19] I'm vow. I'll trust you. Hallelujah.
[50:20] Whether you give or take away, I will
[50:23] praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; He said, I am vow. What shall I answer
[50:29] thee? How am I going to answer you,
[50:30] Lord? I will lay my hand upon my mouth.
[50:33] Good answer. There's a good answer. I'm
[50:36] vow. Now, I'm going to stop talking.
[50:39] I'm going to stop telling you how to run
[50:41] your business.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Would you like that, Austin,
[50:45] if somebody come around and tells you
[50:46] how to run your business? You would you
[50:47] like that?
[50:48] &gt;&gt; I don't think I would. I would I
[50:49] wouldn't want somebody walk into my
[50:50] house and well, listen, this is how you
[50:52] do your house. It's my house.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; So, Job's like, I'm sorry.
[51:01] That's a good answer. Sometimes, church,
[51:03] when you pray, it's good just to do
[51:04] that.
[51:06] If you can't say anything good to God,
[51:10] don't say anything at all. Hallelujah.
[51:13] Until you can muster up some praise.
[51:15] God, you're worthy. God, I love you.
[51:18] You're in control. I can't answer you
[51:21] just like Job can't answer you.
[51:25] Verse five. Now, he still didn't cover
[51:27] his mouth. Once I've spoken, but I will
[51:29] not answer. Yay, twice, but I will
[51:31] proceed no further. And look what Job or
[51:34] look what God tells Job next in verse
[51:36] six. Then answer the Lord unto Job out
[51:37] of the whirlwind. Now look we now church
[51:39] you got a whirlwind. So I love those AI
[51:40] videos. They do these Job's on his knees
[51:43] and he's covered in and all these all
[51:45] these soores, you know, he's all over
[51:47] his body and the whirlwind is wrapping
[51:49] around him. I just love how they
[51:50] dramatized it. And God's like, I'm going
[51:53] to answer you again. I'm speaking right
[51:55] out of the whirlwind. In other words, I
[51:56] can't control this this this act of
[51:58] nature. There's power here outside of
[52:01] me. There's power greater than me. Alls
[52:03] I can do is just be quiet and listen to
[52:06] God. That's what God wants us to do many
[52:08] times. Be quiet. Listen to him. He said,
[52:12] "Gird up thy loins like a man." So they
[52:15] would gird up their their garment,
[52:16] right? So they could move about, they
[52:18] could run, their their knees could have
[52:20] free movement. And then the garment
[52:22] would come usually they're lower. They'd
[52:23] come up to the knees. They'd gird it up,
[52:25] tuck it in so they could do some work.
[52:26] So God's saying, "Okay, show me your
[52:28] work. Show me what you got, tough guy.
[52:32] G up your loins like a man. I will
[52:34] demand of thee and declare thou unto me.
[52:36] In other words, I've got more things to
[52:37] ask you and I'm waiting for your answer.
[52:41] Yet in heaven, he's like, Job is the
[52:43] best. Hallelujah. This is my son. He's
[52:46] my my best one on the earth. Nobody like
[52:50] him, brother Mercy. Nobody like Job.
[52:54] Have you considered him? He's such he's
[52:56] such a fine example of a Christian.
[52:57] Praise God. He's such a wonderful
[52:59] message believer. But down on the earth,
[53:01] he's got You got anything else for me?
[53:02] Anything else you want to say? What
[53:04] else? Uh, I got all these questions. You
[53:07] want to answer any? Can you answer one
[53:08] of them, please?
[53:11] Hallelujah.
[53:15] I'll demand it and then you answer me.
[53:17] Verse eight. Wilt thou also disenol
[53:20] judgment? So, see, Job was judging God
[53:23] harshly, the wrong way. Wilt thou
[53:25] condemn me that thou mayest be
[53:28] righteous?
[53:30] Hallelujah.
[53:32] So other words, God's saying, you're
[53:33] fighting against me. You're speaking
[53:34] against me. You're making yourself more
[53:36] righteous than I am.
[53:39] And we've all, I'm sure all of us have
[53:41] thought that at some point. God, this is
[53:43] not how I wanted my life to go.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; God, this was not in my plans. God don't
[53:51] care about your plans. Hallelujah.
[53:55] God didn't ask you for your plans. God
[53:57] didn't ask you, "Did you want to be born
[53:58] in Leodysia? Do you want to be born in
[54:01] 2000?"
[54:03] God didn't ask Tulsi, "Do you want to be
[54:04] born in 2025?" Liel, did you want to be
[54:07] born? Nope. God's got a plan. We can
[54:10] trust God.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; And then he asks all these great
[54:16] questions. Verse nine, do you have an
[54:18] arm like God? Do you have do you have
[54:20] strength like God? Verse nine. Or canst
[54:23] thou thunder with a voice like him? Go
[54:25] ahead, Job. Let me hear your thunder.
[54:30] I'm in pain.
[54:32] That's all, church. That's all we can
[54:34] muster.
[54:38] And God is showing us how insignificant,
[54:40] how little we are, how great he is.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; He breaks into the behemoth. Verse 15.
[54:46] Now, this is my best guess for the
[54:48] behemoth, children. So, it's probably
[54:50] the Gigantosaurus because that's the
[54:52] biggest fossil they found. Okay, the
[54:55] Gigantosaurus.
[54:57] That's at least according to Google. All
[54:58] right, I could be wrong. But here's a a
[55:00] man's height. Now, the man isn't even up
[55:02] to his his knee. That's kind of like
[55:05] Tulsi, you know, or Ellie there. If you
[55:06] stood him up, they're probably not up to
[55:08] your knee.
[55:10] And God asks him about the behemoth.
[55:13] Verse 19, he's the chief of the ways of
[55:15] God. He hath made him. I'm sorry. He
[55:18] that made him can make him his sword to
[55:20] approach unto him. Surely the mountains
[55:22] bring him forth food. So where does he
[55:24] go to eat? The mountains.
[55:27] Because the valleys and the plains don't
[55:29] have enough food for him. He's got to go
[55:30] up to the mountains.
[55:34] He lith under the shady trees and the
[55:35] covert of the reed and ferns. Verse 23.
[55:39] Behold, he drinkketh up a river. When he
[55:42] gets thirsty, he's got to go to the
[55:43] river.
[55:45] He don't go to the water fountain. He
[55:47] goes to the river and hasteth not. He
[55:50] trustth that he can draw up Jordan into
[55:52] his mouth. He taketh it with his eyes.
[55:54] His nose pierces through snares.
[55:57] Then in chapter 41, he breaks into the
[56:00] Leviathan. Now, this hopefully this
[56:02] isn't too scary for the kids, but it's
[56:04] quite a it's quite an intimidating
[56:06] description here in the scripture.
[56:09] It's a sea dragon.
[56:11] And God said, "Can you draw him out with
[56:13] a hook,
[56:15] or can you get him with a cord? Could
[56:17] you pull this out of the sea? Can you
[56:20] put a hook in his nose? Can you bore his
[56:23] jaw through with a thorn? Will he make
[56:26] Will he beg you and make supplications
[56:28] unto you to please don't bother him?
[56:32] Will he speak soft words unto you? Will
[56:34] he make a covenant with you? Will you
[56:36] make him for a servant forever?" In
[56:37] verse four, will you will you play with
[56:39] him as a ver a bird? In verse five,
[56:42] will you bind him for your maidens? Do
[56:43] your little girls want to play with him?
[56:48] My
[56:51] Look at verse Look at verse 19 just so
[56:53] to see what we see what kind of creature
[56:55] this is. Out of his mouth go burning
[56:58] lamps and sparks of fire leap out. So
[57:02] this was a firebreathing sea serpent,
[57:05] we'd say, or sea creature. Now I might
[57:06] not be a sea serpent but we get the idea
[57:08] of scales
[57:12] and this is God's final statement.
[57:15] Hallelujah.
[57:17] He says behold he holdeth I'm sorry. He
[57:20] beholdeth all the high things. He is
[57:23] king over all the children of pride. So
[57:27] he takes Job on this tour down to hell
[57:29] through the oceans. He takes him up to
[57:31] the highest stars, constellations, and
[57:34] then he ends with a Gigantosaurus, and
[57:36] he ends with a Leviathan, the sea
[57:38] serpent, and said, "He's the king of all
[57:41] of it, Job."
[57:43] And then God goes away.
[57:46] God's done.
[57:48] Well, I'm still sick. I still I'm
[57:51] penniless. I don't got any money in my
[57:53] pockets.
[57:56] I'm I'm still broken. I'm hurting.
[58:01] God didn't answer one of his questions.
[58:03] Church, let's not be discouraged if God
[58:05] doesn't answer our prayers.
[58:07] There has to be some purpose for it.
[58:11] Praise God.
[58:15] Now, just for so the children know, this
[58:17] is this is this is real. This is a real
[58:19] creature because there's such a thing as
[58:21] a bombader beetle. If you haven't seen
[58:23] the bombader beetle, look it up. He
[58:25] makes sparks fly out of his mouth and
[58:27] he's just a real tiny beetle. I've
[58:28] showed it to my kids at school. A real
[58:30] small little beetle and he can shoot
[58:32] sparks of fire. If that's a little if
[58:35] that what kind of sparks would the
[58:36] Leviathan get if a little bombader
[58:38] beetle can shoot sparks out to scare
[58:40] away its enemies. It just it's proof
[58:43] that God had something like this. Now,
[58:46] the flood probably killed him off
[58:47] somehow. I don't know. I'm just I'm just
[58:49] presuming there. But all these creatures
[58:51] are real. God doesn't lie. God doesn't
[58:54] tell myths.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, children.
[58:59] All right, Job 42. I'm almost done here
[59:02] by God's grace.
[59:05] So after all this virtual tour of the
[59:07] universe and finishing with the two
[59:10] greatest beasts on the earth, right? One
[59:13] a water beast and one a land beast. Then
[59:16] Job answered the Lord and said, verse
[59:17] two, 42 verse2, I know that thou can't
[59:20] do everything. You can do it all, God.
[59:23] In other words, if God wants to bring me
[59:25] money, God will do it. If God wants to
[59:28] bring me good health, God will do it.
[59:32] But if God wants to give me children,
[59:33] God will do that, too. If God wants to
[59:36] give me good sleep at night, he'll do
[59:38] that. It's up to God.
[59:41] Hallelujah.
[59:44] No thought can be withholded from thee.
[59:45] Verse three, who is he that hideth
[59:47] counsel without knowledge? Therefore
[59:49] have I uttered that I understood not
[59:53] things too wonderful for me which I knew
[59:55] not. Here I beseech thee and I will
[59:57] speak. I will demand of thee and declare
[59:59] thou unto me. I have heard of thee by
[1:00:02] the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye
[1:00:03] seeth. Wherefore I abhore myself and
[1:00:06] repent in dust and ashes.
[1:00:10] So this is what God wanted out of this
[1:00:12] whole situation. out of the tour of the
[1:00:14] universe, God wanted a servant that
[1:00:17] would trust him and realize God's
[1:00:19] greater than me. God knows things I
[1:00:21] don't know, and I just need to humble
[1:00:23] myself and keep repenting of my sins.
[1:00:27] Hallelujah.
[1:00:30] God didn't answer one of his questions,
[1:00:32] but God gave him 75, 71, somewhere
[1:00:34] around there. 70 questions that Job
[1:00:36] couldn't answer.
[1:00:38] And we can't really answer either.
[1:00:41] Hallelujah.
[1:00:44] Now you the Now look at verse seven. Now
[1:00:46] God switches back to being on Job's
[1:00:48] side. It seems like right now God was on
[1:00:50] Job's side the whole time, but it didn't
[1:00:51] seem like it. Verse seven. And it was so
[1:00:54] that after the Lord had spoken these
[1:00:55] words unto Job, the Lord said unto
[1:00:57] Elephaz, the Temonite, "My wrath is
[1:01:00] kindled against thee and against thy two
[1:01:02] friends, for they have not spoken of me
[1:01:04] the thing that is right as my servant
[1:01:06] Job had." Now look, God recognized Job
[1:01:08] said some good things, right? the
[1:01:10] repentance,
[1:01:12] right? But God when he come down, he
[1:01:14] said, "Job, you said a lot of bad
[1:01:15] things, too." See, church, it just shows
[1:01:18] God is going to rebuke us. He's going to
[1:01:20] correct us for our evil words. But God
[1:01:22] also keeps record of our good words as
[1:01:24] well.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Our times we praise God. The times we
[1:01:27] give God glory, the time we say, "I love
[1:01:29] you, Lord, no matter what you allow,
[1:01:31] I'll still serve you." God sees the good
[1:01:33] things as well. Hallelujah.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Look at verse eight. This reminds you of
[1:01:40] Abraham. Therefore, take unto you now
[1:01:42] seven bullocks and seven rams and go to
[1:01:44] my servant Job and offer up for
[1:01:46] yourselves a burnt offering, and my
[1:01:48] servant Job shall pray for you. For him
[1:01:50] will I accept. What?
[1:01:53] God's going to only accept these people
[1:01:55] if one of his servants pray for them.
[1:01:58] Doesn't that remind you of Abraham?
[1:02:01] God told Pharaoh, "Go have Abraham pray
[1:02:03] for you and that disease will leave your
[1:02:05] house."
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:08] See now, now, now we see how much God
[1:02:11] loves his servants.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; And church, how much God hears your
[1:02:14] prayers,
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; whether they're answered the way you
[1:02:18] want or not,
[1:02:24] lest I deal with you after your folly,
[1:02:27] in that ye have not spoken to me that
[1:02:28] thing which is right, like my servant
[1:02:30] Job. But remember, Job had said some
[1:02:31] wrong things, too. But God forgives that
[1:02:34] because Job repented and he recognizes
[1:02:36] the right things Job did say.
[1:02:39] Hallelujah. Look at verse 10. Here's the
[1:02:41] comeback. And the Lord turned the
[1:02:43] captivity of Job when he prayed for his
[1:02:46] friends. Now, how did he get the
[1:02:47] victory? He prayed for his persecutors.
[1:02:53] Hallelujah.
[1:02:55] In other words, church, if you're
[1:02:57] suffering is if someone's hurt you, you
[1:02:59] have to pray for them with the love of
[1:03:01] Jesus Christ in your heart.
[1:03:04] Because what what what does that show?
[1:03:06] That shows you've got the victory over
[1:03:08] anger, right? Over jealousy or whatever
[1:03:11] it may be. You've got the victory over
[1:03:13] that. In other words, you trust God.
[1:03:15] God's in control of my persecutors.
[1:03:18] God's in control of those who speak evil
[1:03:20] against me. God's in control of that.
[1:03:22] And if I can ask for God's mercy on
[1:03:24] them, then God will bless me. Because
[1:03:26] I've not taken the wrong spirit, I've
[1:03:28] taken the right spirit.
[1:03:31] Church is so hard. Sometimes our
[1:03:32] mothers, our fathers, our grandpas, our
[1:03:34] uncles have been so mean to us. And it's
[1:03:37] real pain. The Bible said a broken
[1:03:40] spirit or wounded spirit, who can bear
[1:03:41] in the book of Proverbs. But yet God
[1:03:44] still expects us to get to the spot. And
[1:03:46] I'll say like this, God's going to bring
[1:03:48] us to the spot where we can forgive
[1:03:50] those who've sinned against us.
[1:03:54] When did Job's victory come? When did
[1:03:55] the comeback happen? When he learned to
[1:03:57] forgive those who had hurt him.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; I know numerous people who still can't
[1:04:04] forgive people in their life from the
[1:04:06] past. And one of them recently told me
[1:04:08] it's like a cloud that hangs over them.
[1:04:11] It's a cloud.
[1:04:14] Church, if we want forgiveness, we've
[1:04:15] got to extend it.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Things started changing when Job could
[1:04:21] forgive.
[1:04:23] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Things
[1:04:26] will start changing for you and I when
[1:04:28] we can forgive others as well.
[1:04:31] Pray for others.
[1:04:35] Don't you love that, man? And what the
[1:04:37] Lord do? The Lord also gave Job twice as
[1:04:41] much as he had before. Now, we all wish
[1:04:44] that pertain to us, don't don't we?
[1:04:48] Oh, God could double my income. Oh my,
[1:04:50] that'd be wonderful. Well, sure. Let me
[1:04:52] go through it. No, I don't think you
[1:04:53] understand what you're saying.
[1:04:55] I don't think you understand.
[1:04:58] This shows the mercy of God.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Now, not not everybody gets this, right?
[1:05:06] I think it was Jere Yeah, Jeremiah died.
[1:05:08] He was stoned uh by the Jews, his own
[1:05:11] people. Isaiah was sawed with saw. So,
[1:05:13] did Job get twice as much as he had? I'm
[1:05:15] sorry. Did Isaiah get twice as much as
[1:05:17] he had before? No. Not everybody gets
[1:05:20] this.
[1:05:21] But this shows the goodness of God.
[1:05:24] This shows when we go through trials, if
[1:05:27] we can just forgive, if we can just
[1:05:29] realize how little we are, if we can
[1:05:31] just get the victory, God will give us a
[1:05:33] new season.
[1:05:35] Praise the Lord.
[1:05:38] I'm going to close with this here. Give
[1:05:40] me about uh when I say close, it's about
[1:05:41] 15 minutes. Okay, so let me set the
[1:05:42] timer here. You've been a good faithful
[1:05:45] uh audience. Appreciate you pulling on
[1:05:46] the word of God. Let me just remind you
[1:05:48] that God cares about every detail of our
[1:05:50] lives.
[1:05:52] Jesus said in Matthew 10:30, "Even the
[1:05:55] very hairs of your head are all
[1:05:57] numbered.
[1:05:58] Fear not, therefore, for you are more
[1:06:00] valuable, I'm sorry, more value than
[1:06:02] many sparrows."
[1:06:04] God has all your hairs counted.
[1:06:09] Job 14:5, "Seeing his days are
[1:06:12] determined, the number of his months are
[1:06:14] with thee, thou hast appointed his bonds
[1:06:16] that he cannot pass." Hallelujah. God's
[1:06:19] determined everything about your life,
[1:06:21] the timing of your life. God has it all
[1:06:23] planned out.
[1:06:26] Psalm 139:16, "Thine eyes did see my
[1:06:29] substance, yet being unperfect, and in
[1:06:31] thy book all my members were written,
[1:06:34] which in continuence were fashioned,
[1:06:36] when as yet there was none of them."
[1:06:41] So God saw everything we become before
[1:06:44] we became here on the earth. Hallelujah.
[1:06:46] Before we were here, God saw all of us.
[1:06:49] Church, God knows your thoughts even
[1:06:51] before you say them. You ever been in a
[1:06:52] conversation? I wonder what I'm going to
[1:06:53] say next. What can I say to that? What
[1:06:55] can I God already knows what you're
[1:06:56] going to say.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Psalm 139:4. For there's not a word in
[1:07:01] my tongue, but oh Lord, thou knowest it
[1:07:03] altogether.
[1:07:07] God knows when you get up and when you
[1:07:09] lie down. I think about that in the
[1:07:10] morning. Mercy. When I get up, I I roll
[1:07:12] out of bed. I take my first two steps.
[1:07:14] I'm reminded of this verse that God saw
[1:07:16] my steps.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; It's in Psalm 139 verse 2 and three.
[1:07:22] Thou knowest my downsitting. So God
[1:07:24] knows when you sit down. God knows when
[1:07:26] you sit down for the service and your
[1:07:29] uprising. Thou understandest my thought
[1:07:31] a far off. Thou compass my path and my
[1:07:34] lying down and art acquainted with all
[1:07:35] my ways. God knows everything about your
[1:07:39] day. Hallelujah.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; He knows everything you went through. He
[1:07:43] knows what you're going to face this
[1:07:44] afternoon. He knows about the week
[1:07:46] coming up. Hallelujah.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; He said you're more valuable than
[1:07:50] sparrows.
[1:07:52] You're more valuable than the birds.
[1:07:57] Jesus said in Matthew 6:26, "Are ye not
[1:08:00] much more than they? Aren't you more
[1:08:02] valuable?" He said, "Than the fowls of
[1:08:05] the air."
[1:08:07] Church, God has placed a great value on
[1:08:08] each one of our lives. There's a
[1:08:11] testimony he wants to bring out of our
[1:08:13] lives. You know, there's actually a
[1:08:15] verse where it seems like God catches
[1:08:17] your tears in a bottle in heaven. Pull
[1:08:19] that up there. Psalm 56:8, if you put
[1:08:21] that up there.
[1:08:24] Sometimes you wonder, "Oh, I Brother
[1:08:26] Jesse, I even cried. I I prayed so much.
[1:08:28] I cried about this and still it hasn't
[1:08:30] changed." God saw it. God heard the
[1:08:34] prayer.
[1:08:36] Thou tell us my wonderings. Put thou my
[1:08:38] tears in thy bottle. Are they not in thy
[1:08:42] book? So God's got a book of all your
[1:08:44] life. And he knew you'd cry in this
[1:08:46] chapter. Uh, he knew you'd have joy the
[1:08:49] next chapter. Hallelujah.
[1:08:53] He's got it. He's got it all under
[1:08:54] control, church.
[1:09:02] Psalm 37:23,
[1:09:04] the steps of a good man are ordered by
[1:09:06] the Lord,
[1:09:09] and he delightth in his ways. See, God
[1:09:11] delighted in Job's life.
[1:09:13] God delights in your life as well.
[1:09:17] Proverbs 5:21, "For the ways of man are
[1:09:20] before the eyes of the Lord, and he
[1:09:23] ponderth all of his goingings."
[1:09:26] So, God knew about Malachi getting into
[1:09:28] this career of uh construction, but God
[1:09:32] knows if there's something different
[1:09:34] coming down the road. God knew Chris
[1:09:36] would move this year. Hallelujah.
[1:09:39] Relocate. God knew that. And God knows
[1:09:42] the next place you might go, too.
[1:09:44] He's He's got it all under control. If
[1:09:48] he can get that uh if he can get that do
[1:09:50] ready for you to walk in, he'll get the
[1:09:52] next house ready for you as well. Praise
[1:09:54] God.
[1:09:56] He knows how to do it. He prepares it
[1:09:59] everything. Everything. He makes
[1:10:00] everything perfect in his time.
[1:10:04] Church, God foretold Cyrus that Cyrus
[1:10:08] would come and allow Israel to build
[1:10:09] their temple 200 years before he even
[1:10:13] was born. 200 years God predicted it.
[1:10:16] God knew him by name 200 years before he
[1:10:19] was even born. It's in Isaiah 44:28.
[1:10:23] that saith of Cyrus, he's my shepherd,
[1:10:25] and will perform all my pleasure, even
[1:10:27] to saying to Jerusalem, thou shalt be
[1:10:29] built into the temple, thy foundation
[1:10:31] shall be laid.
[1:10:34] Josiah was foretold 300 years before he
[1:10:37] was born. Church, what am I trying to
[1:10:39] get you to see? God knew you'd be here
[1:10:42] right now in Akran at this time in 225,
[1:10:45] 2025. God knew you about here. He knew
[1:10:48] your name. He knew the hairs on your
[1:10:50] head. He saw your value to serve him.
[1:10:52] Hallelujah.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; He's trustworthy.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; He's got everything under control.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; I think I told that to Brendan in
[1:11:02] college. I used to I used to sit up and
[1:11:04] waste my nights like, "Oh, who am I
[1:11:06] going to, you know, should I marry
[1:11:07] Kristen or what am I going to do after
[1:11:09] college?" And I used to just worry
[1:11:10] myself crazy. What should I do? Should I
[1:11:12] get engaged? What should I do? Am I the
[1:11:15] right one for her? Is she the right one?
[1:11:16] I'd spend all my time worrying. And now
[1:11:19] look, all these years later, I can't
[1:11:20] wait to go to bed. Hallelujah.
[1:11:23] can hardly get me to stay up and worry
[1:11:25] because I'm running around chasing all
[1:11:26] these nine. Well, not all nine, but I
[1:11:28] don't have to chase around the adults
[1:11:29] anymore. It's a joy to have children.
[1:11:32] But I look back and say and think, why
[1:11:34] was I so worried?
[1:11:37] You know, we had that little house there
[1:11:39] in Chicago Falls and I was so worried.
[1:11:40] Oh, we not going to be able to get a
[1:11:41] house and not going to have enough room
[1:11:43] and I forgot about the glory of bunk
[1:11:45] beds. You can keep a lot of kids in a
[1:11:48] house with just a lot of bunk beds,
[1:11:49] brother Mercy. Right.
[1:11:52] You know, I was questioning God and
[1:11:54] how's it going to work out and worrying
[1:11:56] about all these things and the creator
[1:11:57] of the universe is standing outside of
[1:11:58] it. I've got due for you ready in the
[1:12:00] morning.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've got treasure houses of
[1:12:05] snow. I'll send it right on Christmas.
[1:12:06] We'll have a white Christmas. He's got
[1:12:09] everything under control.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Yet, I'll sit up and worry about what's
[1:12:14] going to happen.
[1:12:16] Can I trust God? Did God hear my prayers
[1:12:18] or not? Did God hear my prayer? Does God
[1:12:20] know about me?
[1:12:22] He knew about me before I even came on
[1:12:24] the scene. Hunt before the foundation of
[1:12:26] the world. I was chosen. Maybe Brendon's
[1:12:28] never seen this one. Pull up Ephesians 4
[1:12:30] 1:4. This one meant a lot to me when I
[1:12:31] first became a new Christian buddy. I
[1:12:33] realized where God chose me to serve
[1:12:35] him. It wasn't when I came to church.
[1:12:38] God chose me to serve him in his mind
[1:12:40] before the foundation of the world. So
[1:12:42] when he told Job, "Where were you when I
[1:12:44] founded founded the earth?" In other
[1:12:45] words, God would have said, "You were in
[1:12:46] my mind, Job.
[1:12:48] You were already my servant in my mind
[1:12:50] when I founded the world. So you have
[1:12:51] nothing to worry about. If you're in my
[1:12:53] mind, you'll come. If you were in my
[1:12:55] mind, come down to earth, you'll come
[1:12:56] back to me in heaven.
[1:12:58] According as he hath chosen all of us
[1:13:00] where in him we were chosen in him
[1:13:05] before the foundation of the world, that
[1:13:08] we should be holy. That means separate.
[1:13:12] separate from the things of the world
[1:13:15] and without blame before him in love.
[1:13:19] Serve the Lord Jesus Christ with all
[1:13:21] your love. And if there's any blame,
[1:13:24] confess it. If you do anything wrong,
[1:13:25] just confess it. Try to live a life
[1:13:26] blameless where I just love people. I
[1:13:29] love God. I'm a real Christian and
[1:13:31] people see me as a Christian.
[1:13:32] Hallelujah.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Josiah was foretold. Messa uh uh Jesus
[1:13:37] Christ was foretold 6 thou or 4,000
[1:13:39] years before he come on the scene.
[1:13:42] Hallelujah. Thy seed shall bruise the
[1:13:44] head of the serpent. Hallelujah. And
[1:13:46] thou shalt bruise his heel. 4,000 years
[1:13:48] he was told. John the Baptist was
[1:13:51] foretold over 700 years. Isaiah said,
[1:13:54] "There'll be a voice of him that crith
[1:13:56] in the wilderness, prepare you the way
[1:13:58] of the Lord, make straight the desert, a
[1:14:00] highway for our God."
[1:14:03] And Mary was also foretold 700 years.
[1:14:06] Behold, a virgin shall conceive. Amen.
[1:14:09] Hallelujah. and church, God knows we'd
[1:14:12] come on the scene as well.
[1:14:15] So, in closing, God's prophet, Brother
[1:14:17] Brandham, he uh died in 1965. That's our
[1:14:20] church is kind of founded on his Bible
[1:14:22] teachings. So, like, you know, some
[1:14:23] people quote Billy Graham, the Christian
[1:14:25] Missionary Alliance, they quote Billy
[1:14:26] Graham because he's their founder.
[1:14:29] William Brandham is kind of the founder
[1:14:31] of this movement, this Christian
[1:14:32] movement by God's grace. He said, "Job
[1:14:34] knew he'd not sin because he come upon
[1:14:37] the basis of God's word." In other
[1:14:38] words, Job knew God forgave all of his
[1:14:40] sins.
[1:14:43] He come upon the basis of the shed blood
[1:14:46] knowing that God required a blood
[1:14:48] sacrifice
[1:14:50] and blood was what Job offered. Knowing
[1:14:54] that God could not refuse it.
[1:14:56] Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:14:58] Church,
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; do you realize there's something here
[1:15:01] today that God can't refuse? How many
[1:15:03] want to be accepted by God today?
[1:15:04] There's something you can use that you
[1:15:07] know God can't refuse. Hallelujah.
[1:15:09] That's a nice little rhyme there.
[1:15:10] There's something you can use God can't
[1:15:12] refuse. It's the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, confess all your
[1:15:18] sin and say, "Jesus, forgive me by the
[1:15:19] blood that you shed." You know, God
[1:15:22] can't refuse that. Hallelujah. Because
[1:15:24] that was his provided way to take away
[1:15:26] all sin. Hallelujah. Praise God. He said
[1:15:30] the whole picture is a perfect
[1:15:33] revelation of God's love.
[1:15:37] Men have all these sins. What can we do
[1:15:38] with these sins? We can take them to God
[1:15:42] and God will pay for them with the blood
[1:15:44] of his own son.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; And then we can know God receives me.
[1:15:48] God can't refuse my sacrifice. And then
[1:15:51] God will see you and I Haven God will
[1:15:53] see us nature in heaven as being perfect
[1:15:56] just like Job.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:03] He said, "Job wasn't trusting in his own
[1:16:06] merits." Church, church, don't trust in
[1:16:08] how much you read your Bible this week
[1:16:09] or how much you prayed. You should do
[1:16:10] that. You're going to get weak if you
[1:16:12] don't do that. You're going to get
[1:16:13] wrestled down if you don't do that. But
[1:16:15] we don't trust in that as far as being
[1:16:17] accepted to be saved because we're saved
[1:16:19] by grace. He said, "Job wasn't trusting
[1:16:22] in his own merits, but he'd met God's
[1:16:24] requirement because he stood on the
[1:16:27] blood sacrifice."
[1:16:29] Yes, sir. He know that he was righteous
[1:16:31] because he was meeting God's
[1:16:33] requirement.
[1:16:36] He said, "And then you notice if you'll
[1:16:38] just keep holding out, stand on the
[1:16:40] blood, don't take nothing else." He
[1:16:43] said, "Belong to your denomination.
[1:16:45] That's all right." He said, "Education,
[1:16:47] science, that's all right. But first,
[1:16:50] place yourself on the blood. That's the
[1:16:53] only place of fellowship is the blood.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. Musicians can
[1:16:58] come. Thank you for your patience.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; I trust the Holy Spirit spoke something
[1:17:08] to your heart today about trusting the
[1:17:11] Lord. How many want to trust the Lord
[1:17:12] more?
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; We can trust him with our lives. Uh play
[1:17:15] that. I trust in God. Trust in God, my
[1:17:18] savior. We sang that on Wednesday.
[1:17:24] So friends, before we pray,
[1:17:27] if you want fellowship with God, if you
[1:17:30] want forgiveness from God, if you want
[1:17:32] peace from God,
[1:17:34] there is something we can access today
[1:17:36] that God cannot refuse.
[1:17:40] It's the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:17:43] God can't refuse you if you just come
[1:17:44] and say, "I abhore myself." Or, "Lord,
[1:17:47] I'm vile. I'm sinful. Forgive me for
[1:17:49] saying those things. Forgive me. I did
[1:17:50] this yesterday. God, forgive me what I
[1:17:52] did last week. God, forgive me. Accept
[1:17:53] me. God can't refuse the blood of Jesus
[1:17:55] Christ.
[1:17:58] [Music]
[1:18:01] Let's bow our heads. Think about your
[1:18:02] life just for a moment.
[1:18:05] Church, I want everybody here to leave
[1:18:06] here knowing you've met God's
[1:18:08] requirement. You have peace with God.
[1:18:11] You can trust God. No matter how your
[1:18:12] life's going, whether you like it or
[1:18:14] whether you don't,
[1:18:16] you have something you can do about it,
[1:18:21] you can trust in him.
[1:18:23] You can confess all your sins.
[1:18:25] Hallelujah.
[1:18:27] Glory to God.
[1:18:29] Hallelujah.
[1:18:36] You can say, "God, I know like Job, you
[1:18:39] can do all things.
[1:18:42] Nothing is hidden from your sight.
[1:18:44] Nothing is out of your control.
[1:18:47] You placed me here for a purpose, God,
[1:18:50] and you will accomplish your purpose in
[1:18:52] my life." Hallelujah.
[1:18:55] Praise God.
[1:18:57] Lord, there's something that we can do
[1:19:03] where you will accept us in the beloved.
[1:19:05] The Bible says,
[1:19:09] friends, just think about your life just
[1:19:10] for a moment.
[1:19:18] Is there anything you need to confess to
[1:19:19] the Lord? You don't have to confess it
[1:19:20] to me.
[1:19:23] Is there anything you need to confess?
[1:19:28] Sometimes we say things about God
[1:19:31] without thinking about it. God heard it.
[1:19:34] Maybe God's bringing it back to our
[1:19:35] remembrance today to ask for
[1:19:37] forgiveness.
[1:19:40] [Music]
[1:19:43] We don't want to walk with clouds over
[1:19:44] our heads. We'd say
[1:19:49] we want to be free. Hallelujah. We want
[1:19:52] to have the peace of God hovering over
[1:19:54] us. Praise God.
[1:19:59] Let us pray. Father God, I thank you for
[1:20:02] today. Thank you for the patience of
[1:20:03] your people, Lord. I'm always
[1:20:04] long-winded on Sundays and I just have
[1:20:06] all these thoughts from your word. I
[1:20:08] want to pour it out of my soul, Lord
[1:20:10] God, because I believe this, Lord. I
[1:20:12] know it's hard and I cry because, Lord,
[1:20:14] I struggle at times and I I question
[1:20:17] you, Lord God. I wonder why is God
[1:20:19] allowing this? Why hasn't God done this,
[1:20:21] Lord? Why haven't you done that? And
[1:20:23] Lord, I just want to say I'm a vile
[1:20:25] person at times, Lord God. I'm very
[1:20:27] insignificant. I'm little. I'm nothing.
[1:20:32] I'm vile.
[1:20:34] And sometimes it'd be better if I just
[1:20:36] put my hand over my mouth. Lord, forgive
[1:20:38] me of the times I've said
[1:20:42] wrong things.
[1:20:44] I thought I could run my life better.
[1:20:48] Lord, I couldn't. I couldn't do nothing.
[1:20:52] I can't hardly control anything.
[1:20:56] But Lord, you control all things.
[1:20:59] You've numbered the hairs of our heads.
[1:21:01] Lord God, we're more valuable than
[1:21:03] sparrows. Lord God,
[1:21:07] you chose us in your mind before the
[1:21:09] foundation of the world. That's where we
[1:21:11] come from. So that's where we're going
[1:21:13] back to. We're going back to you.
[1:21:16] going back to heaven where we come from.
[1:21:22] Lord Jesus, be with your people today.
[1:21:23] Lord, if there's any that need prayer,
[1:21:25] Lord, we'll be happy to pray with them.
[1:21:29] Lord, I just desire everyone to trust
[1:21:31] you with their lives, whether good or
[1:21:34] bad or difficult or persecution, peril,
[1:21:38] famine,
[1:21:41] tribulation, whatever it may be. Lord,
[1:21:43] may they remember that nothing can
[1:21:45] separate us from the love of God which
[1:21:47] is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[1:21:51] Give us a heart, Lord, that wants to
[1:21:53] serve you and love you, Lord God. Make
[1:21:55] us thankful today, Lord, for all that we
[1:21:57] do have, Lord God. Hallelujah.
[1:22:00] Grant it, Lord Jesus.
[1:22:08] You are the great creator of the cosmos,
[1:22:11] Lord God. Earth, land, sea, sky,
[1:22:15] the universe, Lord God, the stars, the
[1:22:18] planets. Lord God, you've got that all
[1:22:20] under control. Lord, you are the great
[1:22:23] almighty God. We trust you today. We'll
[1:22:26] sing this song where we trust in God,
[1:22:28] our savior. You saved us by the blood of
[1:22:30] Jesus Christ. May we remember, Lord,
[1:22:33] that you accept the blood of Jesus
[1:22:35] Christ to forgive all a l all of our
[1:22:39] sins. We don't have to walk in sin. We
[1:22:41] don't have to walk in darkness. We want
[1:22:43] to walk in the light today. Granted, I
[1:22:45] pray in Jesus Christ's name. And the
[1:22:48] saints said, "Let's sing the song. If
[1:22:50] anyone needs prayer, I'll be happy
