[0:01] brothers and sisters who you'll be with
[0:03] of all the people in the world these are
[0:06] the ones you'll spend eternity with
[0:09] you go to the job site you go to the
[0:11] grocery store you go to a Home Depot or
[0:13] Lowe's
[0:14] and there's no Fellowship there
[0:17] there's no one that wants to hear about
[0:18] the word of God no one cares you offer
[0:20] Bible studies you say hey you want to
[0:21] hear about this or that and nothing turn
[0:24] their head well I'm good you know I'm
[0:25] okay brother Simon or I'm some you know
[0:27] whatever
[0:28] but we are
[0:30] we are of one mind we have one goal we
[0:34] can focus on one thing is that is the
[0:37] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[0:43] right now I just got done a couple
[0:45] months ago with one of the worst jobs
[0:46] I've had in years and then now I'm on a
[0:49] really really nice job where I do stuff
[0:51] that I usually do and guess what I'd
[0:53] still rather be in the house of God than
[0:56] have one good day at work why because
[0:58] this is where we hear Eternal promises
[1:01] the Lord's not gonna on Judgment Day
[1:03] he's not going to run through all my
[1:05] jobs and say well you're sure to mess
[1:07] this up and this and that no
[1:10] I don't think you can necessarily
[1:11] curious I mean we do our best for Jesus
[1:13] in all things but
[1:15] he cares about his word and working for
[1:17] him so I'm not going to sing us I didn't
[1:19] bring oh wait no I better not let's I'm
[1:22] not gonna sing a song right maybe next
[1:25] time let's just get into the word of God
[1:27] here we are
[1:29] it's a Wednesday night
[1:30] brother Jesse says something they're
[1:32] powerful we're
[1:33] I uh
[1:37] and I was kind of feeling led to teach
[1:39] on that a little bit tonight just real
[1:40] simple but uh
[1:42] and I just clicked right with my what I
[1:45] was thinking so uh
[1:46] I trust for
[1:48] in the will of the Lord so let's turn to
[1:50] Second Thessalonians 2.
[1:52] verse one
[2:04] just a real simple thought Saints but we
[2:06] are we're about application tonight I
[2:09] say like that we're about where we're at
[2:12] and what we are about to see you know
[2:14] and what we're going through
[2:18] and what is coming
[2:20] and uh
[2:22] just got some good study in the last
[2:24] couple of nights here
[2:27] that's not necessarily about this topic
[2:29] but just on a certain subject everyone
[2:31] to look at and
[2:32] running through quotes and looking at
[2:34] scripture and just
[2:36] feeling encouraged by God's grace thank
[2:38] you brother
[2:40] um
[2:40] so let's read this here by God's grace
[2:42] if we could all stand here second
[2:43] Thessalonians 2 and 1 then we'll have
[2:45] one more set of scriptures there
[2:50] now we beseech you Brethren by the
[2:53] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:56] and by our gathering together unto him
[2:58] here we are
[3:00] at the coming of the Lord and we have
[3:01] gathered together
[3:03] sounds rather fitting Maybe
[3:07] notice how we're starting verse two that
[3:10] you shouldn't be not soon shaken in mind
[3:13] why
[3:15] well we all have the ability to hear
[3:17] and we see what the the news and media
[3:20] and what people are talking about
[3:24] Pakistan just had an earthquake 7.7
[3:26] today 50 000 50 000 just died a couple
[3:29] of what a month ago in Syria or however
[3:32] earthquakes the birth pains are
[3:36] increasing
[3:38] and it is about time for Christ to come
[3:41] on the scene
[3:43] that you be not soon shaken in mind or
[3:46] be troubled neither by Spirit nor by
[3:49] word nor by letter as from us
[3:53] as at the day of Christ is at hand
[3:58] and look at verse 3 here
[4:00] let no man deceive you by any means
[4:04] so notice
[4:06] look at where we're at here we're at the
[4:08] Gathering time we're at the time when
[4:09] this thing is going to take place we're
[4:11] literally at the coming of the Lord
[4:14] and he says don't let these things
[4:15] bother you why
[4:17] because if you let these things bother
[4:19] you
[4:21] a deception
[4:23] if you're all worked up about something
[4:26] and we know this
[4:29] is coming
[4:31] it'll be it'll make it a little rougher
[4:34] let no man deceive you by any means for
[4:37] that day shall not come except there
[4:38] come a falling away first and that man
[4:41] of sin be revealed the son of perdition
[4:45] now if we could uh turn to Revelations 3
[4:48] 15 here by God's grace
[4:53] Turner myself
[4:56] very obviously just very familiar
[4:59] are
[5:01] our day here obviously
[5:03] let's read this here
[5:06] 15 through 17 is that what have you okay
[5:08] 15 through 17 he says I Know Thy works
[5:10] that thou art neither cold nor hot I
[5:13] would the downward cold or hot but then
[5:15] because Thou Art lukewarm neither and
[5:18] neither cold nor hot I will spew thee
[5:20] out of my mouth because thou sayest I am
[5:22] rich and increased with goods and have
[5:24] need of nothing and know us not that
[5:26] thou art wretched and miserable and poor
[5:28] and blind and naked that's powerheads
[5:33] dear Lord Jesus Lord we love you and oh
[5:35] God we ask God that you would come Lord
[5:37] and speak to your people Lord
[5:39] and Lord you know you made me Lord and
[5:42] uh in the form you've displayed here
[5:44] Lord
[5:46] as we could even open our eyes now Lord
[5:48] and look at one another and not see the
[5:50] real you Lord or see the real them Lord
[5:52] or each other because the real us is in
[5:55] within us Lord and we're just looking
[5:57] out of a shell or the body that you
[5:59] allowed us to uh
[6:01] carry on life and or you know God we
[6:04] yield these bodies Lord to you Lord I
[6:06] will yield our minds Lord tonight and
[6:09] Lord may you bless the people God lord
[6:10] and we want to be so careful God keep my
[6:13] tongue Lord keep my words Lord as I
[6:15] speak Lord before your holy bride Lord
[6:17] because the Bible says blessed are they
[6:19] that are that are
[6:21] blessed and holy Lord for they'll see
[6:24] that first resurrection Lord so bless
[6:27] those blessed and the holy people Lord
[6:29] that I stand before and Lord may your
[6:31] minister to them tonight Lord and Lord
[6:33] give let me just take me off my notes
[6:34] God or give me your thoughts Lord Lord
[6:36] though I may not have the best
[6:38] vocabulary Lord God we just want to say
[6:40] we'd have me to say well we certainly
[6:42] Love You Lord bless the people God and
[6:44] amen you may have seeds here by God's
[6:47] grace they Pursuit
[6:55] we've been greetings from Living Waters
[6:56] Tabernacle there with Kim's uh I'll say
[7:01] this at Jesus Christ Church there
[7:02] pastored by his faithful Shepherd from
[7:05] The can Smith
[7:08] uh the Bride of Jesus Christ Fellowship
[7:09] here Pastor Bible Justice
[7:13] but it's all the Bride of Jesus Christ
[7:19] you know when it comes down to it
[7:20] there's there's nothing that you and I
[7:24] can do outside of what God allows us to
[7:27] do he said well he says you can do
[7:28] nothing without me
[7:30] and saying to God that's why we fail so
[7:32] many times in life is we need to be
[7:35] yielded to and find the mind of the
[7:37] spirit the yield the moving of the
[7:39] spirits of the what God can speak and
[7:42] work through US amen so we
[7:46] I want to look at the scripture again
[7:47] here he says now we beseech your
[7:49] brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus
[7:51] Christ
[7:52] we are very very close he says and by
[7:54] our gathering together unto him
[7:57] we don't come here to obviously I I
[8:00] don't drive you know two and a half
[8:01] hours on a Wednesday night just to uh
[8:04] be on YouTube or or to or to just go up
[8:07] here and stand behind here but we want
[8:09] to there's a motive and objective behind
[8:11] everything we want to if a brother here
[8:15] feels LED and needs a little break we
[8:17] want to be and give him a little break
[8:19] by God's grace and that we of course we
[8:21] want to try and find what the Lord would
[8:23] have to say to to this group here
[8:26] tonight for this season for this little
[8:28] service here by God's grace so
[8:31] uh and I I want to uh in verse 2 where
[8:34] it says be ye not soon shaken in mind
[8:41] or be troubled
[8:44] the unknown
[8:46] is a scary place
[8:49] the unknown is literally being trying to
[8:53] see beyond these four walls what exactly
[8:56] is going on beyond that wall and this
[8:58] wall and this wall and this one though
[9:00] they'd be windows they're blocked off
[9:01] right now we don't know what's on the
[9:04] other side there and that's the unknown
[9:06] is a scary place for many people we uh
[9:09] hear many times of uh people losing all
[9:13] or losing this or losing that and having
[9:15] marital problems or this problem this
[9:17] problems and many people take their own
[9:19] lives
[9:20] and I'll I'll give you a example I went
[9:22] up to Monroe Michigan last Saturday to
[9:25] help out a guy met at work he needed a
[9:28] little wire line run to his out of his
[9:30] basement there or his crawl space and as
[9:33] I was grow driving up there to Monroe I
[9:36] went through one of their main main
[9:37] roads there and as I was driving through
[9:41] I noticed it was literally six no it was
[9:43] probably uh it was about 11 30 or 11
[9:47] o'clock in the morning and that's pretty
[9:49] early for me on Saturday
[9:51] Amanda give me rest
[9:53] but uh as I was driving I noticed these
[9:55] places and they were completely packed
[9:57] full
[9:58] and I'm looking at you know it's
[9:59] obviously not a McDonald's it's not uh
[10:01] have you ever been through by a
[10:03] Chick-fil-A on a Monday and a Tuesday
[10:04] and a Thursday and obviously not on
[10:06] Sundays but that Chick-fil-A is packed
[10:09] you're waiting 20 minutes on fast food
[10:11] you're waiting 30 minutes sometimes for
[10:13] fast food because so many people want to
[10:15] eat Chick-fil-A right while I'm driving
[10:17] past and I see this place and I'm
[10:18] looking at the names I'm like what is
[10:20] this and I look and I started having the
[10:21] realization that these are uh pot uh
[10:25] distribution or dispensation stores
[10:28] because it's legalized now in Michigan
[10:32] and I'm driving past and there's like
[10:34] six or seven
[10:35] maybe eight of these stores literally
[10:39] covering the sides of the road and they
[10:41] are completely full
[10:44] so I went on to a certain place here did
[10:47] a certain thing I was there about half
[10:48] an hour 45 minutes then I went to this
[10:50] little side job to help this guy out and
[10:52] I was driving back to to two and a half
[10:55] maybe three hours later
[10:56] and I was driving through that and those
[10:58] places are still completely packed
[11:02] Saints have gone
[11:09] uh an Awakening just came as I was
[11:12] driving just something just the burden
[11:15] struck so hard on just
[11:18] saints of God what is going on here
[11:22] they're giving people these drugs to
[11:25] drug them down so they were not be
[11:29] concerned about anything there is a trap
[11:32] being set for the world
[11:36] and as they set the the spring on this
[11:39] trap and the spring on this trap and
[11:41] they're covering their bases here and
[11:42] they're covering Basin there the only
[11:44] way you're not going to notice is if you
[11:46] have your mind you have something else
[11:48] you're entertained with there's other
[11:51] things you care more about than what God
[11:53] has given you
[11:55] which is your freedoms your your mental
[11:57] power your uh your strength your your
[12:00] wisdom your king mental prowess says
[12:03] maybe some would say or however but as
[12:05] they dumb down the people
[12:10] there's only one reason they would do
[12:12] that
[12:12] and that's the cause of distraction
[12:16] and it was working tremendously in
[12:18] Michigan and I feel horrible about this
[12:22] as we said 20 years ago
[12:24] what about 20 years from now
[12:26] as we said 10 years ago what about 10
[12:28] years from now
[12:29] what if the Lord
[12:32] gives us another 10.
[12:34] what condition will America be
[12:37] this great
[12:39] religious Nation
[12:41] where will it be intent where will the
[12:43] I'll say like this we we're such where
[12:45] would it be in one or two more years
[12:49] but the Bible says be not ye soon shaken
[12:52] in your mind
[12:55] so he's a God as I heard the prophet say
[12:58] he said he says we preach salvation we
[13:00] preach receiving the Holy Ghost he goes
[13:03] every service we call for the Lost we
[13:05] call for The Sinner we do this he says
[13:07] we do that we we call the prayer line we
[13:10] get go to the altar he says but we know
[13:12] he says and he's being frank he's being
[13:14] honest he's being transparent before the
[13:16] people he says he says and all you know
[13:18] he says not everyone he says I know this
[13:20] and we all know this as people preach
[13:23] and Minister whatever what we know the
[13:25] majority will never accept it and the
[13:27] jury will never come a lot of people
[13:29] even the prophet God said in the church
[13:30] in his book he said well he says he says
[13:32] he said there's a reason people will not
[13:34] most people will not receive the baptism
[13:36] of the Holy Ghost
[13:39] he says but nonetheless we still have to
[13:41] preach it and we have to teach it
[13:44] amen
[13:45] he says that you be not soon shaken in
[13:47] mind or be troubled
[13:49] when I was driving through that road and
[13:51] just my heart was
[13:53] and I said it's over
[13:55] it's over
[13:57] and it really was a real I live in a
[14:00] small town I don't see much activity
[14:03] I mean there's not you know gang Runners
[14:05] and cabals and all that stuff running
[14:07] through Grand Rapids Ohio
[14:09] but as I go up North I'm just the
[14:11] realization of how I didn't go through
[14:14] downtown Detroit I'm not riding on
[14:16] Nebraska Avenue in Toledo Ohio
[14:19] I'm driving through this town here up in
[14:21] Monroe Michigan and I'm just looking I
[14:23] said this thing's it's over
[14:25] it's over it's almost like it finally
[14:27] struck and I said this thing is over
[14:29] the people the masses are running for
[14:32] comfort
[14:34] the running for satisfaction
[14:37] they're running for a a enjoyment and
[14:40] pleasures of life
[14:48] but you soon not be shaken in mind or be
[14:51] troubled neither by Spirit nor by word
[14:53] he says nor by letter as from us as the
[14:57] day of Christ is at hand so notice even
[14:59] even Paul is saying he says no I write
[15:01] he says well right at the end he says
[15:03] and and this is coming and this is
[15:05] coming he says he says even though I
[15:06] warn you of it and write it he says
[15:08] don't let it trouble you amen why
[15:10] because when you are in the hand of God
[15:12] nothing can what the Bible says what God
[15:14] hath this seal he knoweth those that are
[15:17] his amen
[15:18] and the prophet of God said he said as
[15:20] he's starting to bald as I'm
[15:21] experiencing now he says his wife said
[15:24] well where's your hair he goes in the
[15:25] same place it was beforehand amen
[15:29] Amen brother yes there were probably
[15:31] doesn't battle that too much for the me
[15:33] brother Ray I'm getting yep I'm in there
[15:39] now notice as notice as this now this is
[15:43] the Holy Ghost Field these are the Bride
[15:45] of Jesus Christ these are people what
[15:48] God has foretold he's shown things and
[15:50] he's sending he says don't let these
[15:52] things move you amen remain unmovable
[15:55] unshakable amen what just like our Lord
[15:58] and Savior Jesus Christ what pulling
[16:00] strength from him
[16:02] yes
[16:04] he says and let no man deceive you by
[16:07] any means
[16:10] you you watch every word you watch every
[16:14] action amen praise be to God because
[16:16] what now remember he said there's false
[16:18] anointed ones coming notice the bride
[16:20] will be Anointed with the true Holy
[16:22] Ghost and those false anointed ones will
[16:25] still what they'll be anointed what the
[16:26] true Holy Ghost for the prophet of God
[16:28] said he says the one difference would be
[16:31] the teaching of it
[16:34] which is the ability to rightly divide
[16:37] the word of God Amen
[16:40] praise God
[16:46] now let me tell you you know I just had
[16:48] I just taught a study let's this isn't
[16:50] in my notes I'm going to go here let's
[16:51] go to I believe it it is in Luke let's
[16:54] turn to the Book of Luke real quick I
[16:55] want to show you something
[17:00] as this this thought comes here because
[17:02] I just
[17:03] did a Bible study
[17:05] and this the scripture just jumped
[17:07] before me
[17:11] it is in Luke
[17:15] 24
[17:19] saints of God how are you not going to
[17:21] be deceived
[17:22] number one
[17:24] it'll take the Holy Ghost within you you
[17:26] must have the Holy Ghost
[17:28] he is the keeper right he is the keeper
[17:31] now between these two anointed
[17:34] how will you know the difference because
[17:37] remember it will be in the teaching how
[17:39] will you know the difference
[17:43] now what would Jesus if Jesus was here
[17:45] right now what would he how would he
[17:47] teach
[17:51] look at Matthew look at Luke 24
[17:57] 23.
[18:00] and when they found not his body they
[18:02] came saying that they have also seen a
[18:05] vision of angels which said that he was
[18:07] alive and certain members were with us
[18:10] went to the separate culture and found
[18:11] it even as the women had says but him
[18:14] they saw not
[18:16] then he said unto them o fools and slow
[18:19] of heart to believe all that the
[18:22] prophets have spoken he says ought not
[18:25] Christ who have suffered these things
[18:26] that who entered into his glory now
[18:28] notice what as the Bible said if Jesus
[18:30] now he did not preach this but the Bible
[18:32] said he expounded he taught this he
[18:36] revealed this to him now how does how
[18:38] does the Holy Ghost now Christ right
[18:40] there had sent us a descendant now he
[18:42] what he was fully God Amen in flesh now
[18:45] how did he teach and beginning at Moses
[18:48] and all the prophets he expounded unto
[18:51] them all the scriptures he says to be
[18:55] the things concerning himself
[18:58] of what the prophet always tell us he
[18:59] says teach it from Genesis to
[19:01] Revelations from Revelations to Genesis
[19:04] from Genesis to revelations
[19:06] in what the scriptures amen praise
[19:11] praise me to God you want Riley dividing
[19:13] what the word of God even these
[19:15] scriptures need rightly divided amen
[19:17] praise be to God sure now notice
[19:21] in this time now notice there's going to
[19:23] be notice there's so much trouble he
[19:25] says don't let it affect you
[19:28] but now notice there's also a people in
[19:31] that same day at the coming of our Lord
[19:33] Jesus Christ that say that I am rich and
[19:35] of Christ of goods have need of nothing
[19:37] I'll tell you what saints of God there's
[19:39] one thing I need and that's more of
[19:41] Jesus Christ
[19:42] I was I was driving home the other day
[19:44] and I and and lately I've just had some
[19:47] a couple actions of my things I would
[19:49] say not not filthy things just just uh
[19:51] uh things that was the old me I say like
[19:53] that just I I just I just cut up too
[19:56] much
[19:57] not in a perverted way just uh I should
[20:00] be more encouraging in Christ I should
[20:02] be pointing the people more to the Holy
[20:04] Ghost than I usually do
[20:07] and I kept thinking I said man I do not
[20:08] like this old Simon I want this thing to
[20:11] fully die out
[20:15] I know I need more I need more of the
[20:18] Holy Spirit I need to read another
[20:19] refilling of the baptism of the Holy
[20:22] Ghost
[20:23] amen but now notice here he says these
[20:26] are blind he says wretched naked poor
[20:28] miserable uh and naked Jesus and they
[20:30] don't even know it right
[20:32] that is a terrible place to be in at
[20:35] this time right here at the time of the
[20:37] deception right amen so tonight I'd like
[20:40] to teach on this age
[20:42] this age by the grace of God and I've
[20:44] already got 18 minutes I haven't even
[20:45] start okay well that works out good
[20:47] because I
[20:50] Thessalonians 2 Thessalonians 2 and 9
[20:52] here
[20:53] he says
[20:55] he says and with all deceivableness of
[20:57] unrighteous and then and then them
[20:59] perish because they receive not the love
[21:01] or the truth that they might be saved he
[21:03] says and for this cause God shall send
[21:06] them strong delusion that they should
[21:09] believe a lie
[21:13] so anyone that does not fall in love
[21:16] with this word does not say this is
[21:18] absolutely the truth this and whether
[21:21] they can perform it or not say Lord God
[21:23] I want this in my life Lord make
[21:25] something happen just like this right
[21:28] here for me Lord fulfill your word
[21:29] through my life just like Mary said be
[21:32] it unto me according what to Thy word
[21:33] amen
[21:35] but notice he says there are those that
[21:36] do not love the truth what God said he
[21:39] was what I'm going to send you a strong
[21:41] delusion
[21:43] that they should believe a lie
[21:50] now if there's going to be a lie coming
[21:53] and it's going to be so obvious to the
[21:55] elect
[21:56] but remember they're going to have their
[21:58] right Minds
[22:01] remember God keeps his own and he lets
[22:04] the others fall through he said if the
[22:06] blind lead the blind that both fall in
[22:08] the ditch and God allowed those things
[22:10] he foreordain those to be lost and he
[22:13] foreordained us what to his glory amen
[22:16] for the glory right absolutely uh Romans
[22:18] 9. now notice here
[22:20] and Romans 1
[22:23] he says for the invisible things of him
[22:25] from the creation of the world are
[22:26] clearly seen notice
[22:28] I was thinking about the other day when
[22:30] uh a man was we were talking about the
[22:32] word or whatever and I kept thinking man
[22:33] if he would ask me certain this or
[22:35] certain that I would just walk out to
[22:36] the out to the parking lot and grab a
[22:38] speck of grass and say our scientists
[22:40] can't even make this
[22:42] or go go to a tree limb and say all
[22:44] right no one can even you science can't
[22:46] even make this you take the basic
[22:48] elements of what this is made out of it
[22:51] they can't even you just give a bag of
[22:52] this and a bag of that and from the put
[22:54] them in the old science experiment lab
[22:56] or whatever and they could not even
[22:58] produce life
[23:02] being understood by the things that are
[23:04] made even is eternal power and godhead
[23:07] you get all that just from looking at
[23:09] nature
[23:10] so that they are without excuse
[23:16] to believe evolution
[23:18] there would have to be something
[23:19] mentally wrong with them
[23:22] something that says this can be created
[23:25] out of nothing that nothing can bring in
[23:28] a swore
[23:29] you have to be completely insane and
[23:32] wear that spring up all the way back in
[23:34] the 1800s when they still had good food
[23:37] but a strong delusion why because they
[23:40] saw it they knew there was a God it was
[23:42] a Christian Nation at that point many
[23:44] parts in the 1800s were the Russian
[23:47] Revival the Welsh Revival all those sort
[23:48] of things going on God was moving in
[23:51] many places and what these these Heathen
[23:53] these scientists or whatever would say
[23:54] there is no God and what God gave them
[23:57] up to a reprobate mind the Bible says
[24:01] Romans 1 and 28 even as did not like to
[24:04] retain God and their knowledge God gave
[24:06] them up to a reprobate mind to do those
[24:07] things which are not convenient right
[24:11] professing themselves to be wise they
[24:13] became fools
[24:16] now
[24:18] think about the age we live in this age
[24:22] I was just down in Texas visiting
[24:23] brother Randy and I'll tell you what we
[24:25] need you to rest go visit him he'll
[24:28] sleep in with you to 10 o'clock in the
[24:29] afternoon in the morning
[24:31] and he'll wake up after you do and I
[24:34] said now that's my Hospitality right
[24:36] there that's my Airbnb
[24:37] [Laughter]
[24:40] that's a true story
[24:42] experience it how
[24:43] wonderful brother now
[24:47] think about this age
[24:49] and I was down in Texas and I was
[24:51] talking to a brother down there from the
[24:53] Philippines
[24:54] that goes to Brother David mcgeary's
[24:58] and he's been here you know a certain
[24:59] amount of years
[25:00] and we're just talking about work or
[25:02] whatever after church and he says he
[25:03] said brother he goes he goes here he
[25:05] says you have to work constantly to make
[25:08] it
[25:09] you have to work so much and you have to
[25:11] keep pushing and pressing he says it's
[25:13] not like that anywhere else he's been
[25:16] I thought about that and I'm thinking
[25:19] now notice this is 1959 before the 60s
[25:23] before rock and roll become really huge
[25:27] you know people under the juniper tree
[25:29] like is like Elijah they like to sleep
[25:34] I preached to more tired people than
[25:36] anybody in the world
[25:39] the prophet Malachi 4 the seventh angel
[25:43] Gets behind the desk and people are
[25:44] going
[25:45] [Music]
[25:48] was that brother Tom Brown the fell
[25:49] asleep during the seals
[25:53] the prophet of God says I preached to
[25:55] more tired people
[25:57] than anyone else in the world
[26:00] people is so tired
[26:03] they're so mentally strained
[26:06] 1959
[26:08] I thought that was the Golden Era
[26:10] where you could have one in common make
[26:13] it just fine in the economy
[26:18] tired in 1959 I don't know I don't know
[26:21] what it's like back then all I know is
[26:23] what it's like right now and I'll say
[26:24] like this when I was an apprentice early
[26:26] on starting the jobs the jobs had no
[26:29] push behind them whenever you finish
[26:30] done I mean they had a goal line at a
[26:32] certain time they wanted a timetable
[26:34] they wanted to finish But as time
[26:36] progressed in the last 20 years the time
[26:38] started pressing why because they were
[26:40] given bonuses to the foreman to the
[26:42] superintendents to get a certain job
[26:44] done at a certain time and they would
[26:46] push you and push you and push you and
[26:48] said hey we have this date set right
[26:50] here and I noticed and I said I told my
[26:52] four minute time and I was Apprentice I
[26:54] said wow we're just getting pushed it's
[26:55] like they they want this thing done
[26:57] faster and faster and faster and he says
[26:59] I don't understand it
[27:01] the pressure is increasing
[27:05] he said there's so mentally strained
[27:07] until they're filling the insane
[27:08] institutions and hospitals everywhere
[27:11] they're wet in such a nervous condition
[27:13] until they don't know how they don't
[27:15] know what to believe and what they want
[27:18] they're just laying there they don't
[27:19] know what to do oh it's such a sad sight
[27:21] and here we are in America right now
[27:23] people have no idea what they want
[27:27] a young man about a year and a half ago
[27:29] killed himself
[27:31] and he was so depressed I said do you
[27:34] have a job he says no I got laid off I
[27:35] said well go get a job because I have
[27:37] pakistanis I have a a Thailand people
[27:41] who would love to get right here and
[27:43] start working
[27:45] and he was so depressed because his life
[27:47] wasn't my sister his life wasn't going
[27:49] the way he wanted
[27:51] and took his own life and yet thousands
[27:53] and millions of people are flooding into
[27:55] America looking for opportunity
[28:01] he has no he had no idea what he had in
[28:04] his hands what opportunities were given
[28:07] to him and he missed it
[28:10] he says they don't know what to do oh
[28:12] it's such a sad
[28:14] site
[28:16] he says he says neither can you play
[28:18] cars until it's dull you could take a
[28:20] thousand siestas and try to sleep it off
[28:23] he says and you can't do all these four
[28:25] little all these little remedies only
[28:27] things does is give them help the
[28:28] symptoms we've got to have a cure for
[28:30] the disease we've got he says all the
[28:32] psychologists the world cannot cure he
[28:34] says the Cure is the blood of Jesus
[28:36] Christ
[28:38] the majority every time I get a
[28:40] refilling of the Holy Ghost is when I
[28:42] feel my self-refresh
[28:46] I feel strong again I feel refocused why
[28:51] because I had a fresh experience with
[28:54] the presence of God himself
[28:56] and I'll tell you what if there's if
[28:58] there's anyone that can affect you it's
[29:00] what the Holy Ghost
[29:02] remember the The Works the three works
[29:04] of Grace are all done by the Holy Spirit
[29:07] the Bible says there are some that what
[29:09] water he said there's some that plant he
[29:11] says but it gave what God to give the
[29:13] increase amen
[29:15] all we do is play such a very very small
[29:18] part
[29:19] just a little infinite part of in the
[29:22] infantism tissimo or whatever you want
[29:24] to say apart just little uh a skosh or a
[29:26] little bit of a little bit a little bit
[29:28] that's all we do is a little bit and
[29:29] then what God takes what little we have
[29:31] and he multiplies it over and over and
[29:34] over what and what gives strength to
[29:36] others amen one little word good word
[29:38] said to this brother can expand and
[29:40] multiply this sister that brother this
[29:41] sister that brother and what God does
[29:43] all of it
[29:44] if we could just yield to give if we
[29:47] could just give him like the two fishes
[29:49] and the three loaves or however
[29:50] hey man now
[29:52] sir now notice what the Bible says in
[29:54] Isaiah 40
[29:55] verse 28 hast thou not known hast thou
[29:59] not heard that the Everlasting God the
[30:01] Lord the creator of heavens and earth
[30:03] fainteth not neither is weary then why
[30:05] are we so weary Saints
[30:07] why are we so tired
[30:10] I hate to call it out but just went back
[30:12] there and prayed and progester look at
[30:14] me in the eye and his right eye is
[30:16] twitching like this

[30:34] his understanding he given the power to
[30:37] the faint
[30:38] this is promise for you
[30:43] he says and to them that have no might
[30:45] he increases strength
[30:48] where do we pull what source do we have
[30:50] the Lord Jesus Christ that's it the Holy
[30:52] Ghost he says even the you shall faint

[31:12] says and the young man shall utterly
[31:14] fall see the condition of that age
[31:18] so much pressure

[31:22] brother Malachi's shoes right now
[31:25] he's got a good head on his shoulders by
[31:27] God's grace raised in a proper family
[31:29] raised under the word of God
[31:31] and baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[31:34] and now he's at an age now where he's
[31:36] got to
[31:38] he's just a couple of years away from
[31:40] stepping into full manhood and full
[31:42] responsibility
[31:44] he has majored pray for this brother
[31:46] right here
[31:47] he's got to choose to go to college
[31:49] and when you go to college you might
[31:51] incur that and then how you're going to
[31:52] pay that off then what kind of job this
[31:54] there's a then who now who's gonna who's
[31:56] he gonna who's gonna choose for a wife
[31:58] that is a lot of pressure in this day
[32:03] sisters same as well
[32:05] sister Lydia graduating this year
[32:08] big choices big decisions a lot of
[32:11] pressure in this day
[32:15] even the youth shall faint and beware in
[32:17] the young men shall utterly fall but
[32:19] they that weighed upon the Lord shall
[32:22] renew their strength amen
[32:26] should we just go say I got it I got I
[32:28] feel great I feel blessed you better
[32:30] make sure you've waited on the Lord and
[32:33] it's his I'll say it like this I heard
[32:34] the prophet of God say one day blesses
[32:36] her I heard the prophet God said one day
[32:37] he said what he said he says we need
[32:39] that backside of the desert experience
[32:41] and he says what he says he says where
[32:43] you've met you spoke to God
[32:46] and he spoke to you
[32:49] oh
[32:51] how many times have we spoken to the God
[32:54] but we have not heard back oh my but
[32:57] remember the back side of the desert is
[32:58] what it's a communion where you speak to
[33:01] him and he speaks back and give you
[33:03] direct orders he gives you direct
[33:05] directions amen he gives you a path to
[33:08] walk he give you instruction amen
[33:11] praise God
[33:13] but they that wait upon the Lord shall
[33:15] renew their strength and they shall
[33:17] Mount up with wings as the Eagles
[33:20] the ego anointing
[33:22] flying high above all troubles all
[33:24] worries whether by by word or by or by
[33:28] this or by that rumors of wars and wars
[33:31] and famines and pestilences
[33:34] they shall run and not be weary
[33:38] they shall walk
[33:43] this age
[33:46] we're going to see something
[33:49] see something we can't even imagine
[33:52] you say brother how's that possible two
[33:54] thousand years ago when Jesus Christ
[33:55] came on the scene do you think Peter a
[33:57] year before the ministry of Christ was
[33:58] just fishing
[34:00] not one thing in his mind was saying I'm
[34:02] going to walk on water
[34:04] not one thing in his mind says I'm going
[34:06] to tell the Lord you're not going to die
[34:07] and he's going to call me Satan
[34:09] he's gonna he's and he went right
[34:11] through it he kept on chugging along he
[34:14] says he says I understood that wasn't me
[34:16] that was the Devil in Me amen oh my
[34:20] but there's things coming he says what
[34:22] they that know their gods shall do
[34:24] exploits
[34:27] do you think Joshua following Moses knew
[34:30] he was going to speak to the Sun and to
[34:31] the Moon
[34:32] and say Moon and Sun stand still
[34:35] that never even crossed his mind
[34:39] so where'd that thought come from it
[34:43] came from above amen it came from what
[34:45] the master of the Sun and the Moon amen
[34:47] praise be to God that's where the
[34:49] inspiration came from why because what
[34:51] God is not weary and he's not faint amen
[34:55] praise be to God Amen
[34:58] it's coming
[34:59] and full expectation
[35:01] because when there's there's something
[35:03] that is that's moving it's going to put
[35:05] us in a press it's going to push us and
[35:07] it's going to squeeze out whatever's
[35:09] within us it's coming out Saints pretty
[35:11] soon whatever is within you is coming
[35:13] out
[35:18] and if the holy spirit's in there
[35:21] he will do the works that he needs to do
[35:26] he says so then I thought well what
[35:28] would I speak to this congregation well
[35:29] they're probably trained right in
[35:31] everything no doubt but there's a but
[35:33] there is a pressure on the people today
[35:35] he says and that pressure has no
[35:37] limitation
[35:38] or any denominational lines it has no
[35:42] age line
[35:43] it has no respect a person it's on the
[35:46] young and old the good and the bad it's
[35:48] on everybody pressure
[35:52] but brother the devil's really attacking
[35:54] me because I'm in the army of the Lord
[35:55] let me tell you something the worldly
[35:57] people get attacked just as much they
[35:59] come down with Cancers they have
[36:01] divorces they lose Finance Deals they do
[36:04] this they lose their houses just like
[36:05] they have they battle the same things we
[36:07] do the only thing is we have the Lord
[36:09] Jesus Christ
[36:11] we have a hope
[36:13] we have faith and we have what carry or
[36:18] Divine love amen
[36:21] we have the answer amen
[36:25] we know who to go to yes amen that's
[36:28] right
[36:31] we know exactly we have a help
[36:34] we have help
[36:37] these people dying over here in the
[36:39] hospital little babies dying because of
[36:41] cancer they got at two years old or
[36:43] three years old or four years old saints
[36:44] of God and we pray over our young ones
[36:46] and God heals them amen I'll come down
[36:49] with this or that before I just lay
[36:50] hands on myself and say ain't got time
[36:52] praise me to God and I keep marching on
[36:54] amen Amen Brother Ray knows about that
[36:56] absolutely
[37:00] it has no respect to persons it's on
[37:03] young and old
[37:05] good and bad it's on everybody
[37:08] pressure
[37:11] but you know a lot about a person when
[37:13] you see them under pressure
[37:18] he says a day of pressure hurry hurry

[39:47] doing something wrong or acting on a
[39:49] place that deception
[39:51] all this pressure and then doing
[39:52] something out of place will come
[39:55] see
[39:56] we have to have
[39:58] sound Minds
[40:02] now
[40:04] he says it's them it'll attack the
[40:06] middle class the rich act that way it'll
[40:08] make the make the wrong act that way
[40:11] it'll make the pretty good act that way
[40:12] he says it'll make all the good act that
[40:14] way because it's tension steam build up
[40:16] got to blow it off somewhere see you
[40:18] don't blow up the boiler
[40:21] you can lose your mind
[40:22] so much pressure and tension on you you
[40:25] can literally go insane
[40:31] you've got so much on your mind you can
[40:33] actually I just saw a thing on it where
[40:35] in chess there's a thing called chest
[40:38] blindness
[40:40] even the grand Masters can sit in a game
[40:42] and these guys have studied for years
[40:44] memorized everything every move
[40:47] but they've got so much moving in their
[40:49] mind they say it comes in like it's
[40:51] almost like a like a like a snow
[40:52] blindness and they'll be sitting there
[40:54] looking in the move and they'll actually
[40:56] forget how the pieces even move
[40:59] a grand master
[41:01] because there's so much on their minds
[41:03] so much pressure and they go they call
[41:04] it chest blindness
[41:06] and they'll lose the match
[41:10] the Grand Master is like in The Rook
[41:12] cause
[41:14] yet he knows everything
[41:16] because of the amount of pressure
[41:19] on the mind
[41:21] in their heart
[41:24] and as a Christian
[41:26] let me say like this
[41:29] no we're just going to get there hold on
[41:31] let's just let's speed up here I want to
[41:32] get to something here
[41:34] he says now notice he says and any young
[41:38] people that can stand in the building
[41:39] with their hands up all like this
[41:40] carrying rock and roll and stuff and
[41:41] being next to its insanity is dangerous
[41:44] we've gone the mental faculty faculties
[41:47] have broke down
[41:49] remember the tree of knowledge only goes
[41:51] so far and then it swings backward
[41:54] the knowledge of tree the tree of
[41:56] knowledge of what good
[41:58] and there's so much good so much
[42:01] knowledge that comes out he says and
[42:02] then he says it swings backward what
[42:04] comes to evil it has to because that's
[42:07] the nature of the tree
[42:10] it's not the tree of good and only good
[42:12] and good and some great it's the tree of
[42:15] knowledge of Good and Evil
[42:20] now
[42:22] he goes on talking about the women and
[42:24] start getting to menopause this and that
[42:26] earlier and earlier and earlier he says
[42:27] he says your mother he says my mother
[42:29] he's your mother stuck at about 40 to 45
[42:31] 50 he says my muffs my wife struck that
[42:34] at 35 now it's down to 20. the whole
[42:37] human race is rotten he says well if
[42:40] them physical beings of our body is
[42:42] tearing down like that from eating
[42:43] hybrid Foods tensions that's rotting it
[42:46] he says doesn't uh does that not also
[42:49] rot the brain cell
[42:53] you watch these modern day Catholics who
[42:55] debate for
[42:56] uh abortion for abortion and four male
[43:00] and female and you watch them go Toe to
[43:02] Toe with these people and they ask
[43:05] logical
[43:06] simple
[43:08] basic questions
[43:10] and the eyes of the people are like
[43:11] glazed
[43:15] what is a woman
[43:19] no
[43:20] I can't define that
[43:23] their mental faculties
[43:26] is gone
[43:28] basic not even Christian just basic
[43:31] logic and reasoning
[43:35] just
[43:36] gone
[43:38] there's nothing there
[43:40] is nothing to do they can't help them
[43:42] it's too far gone unless the Lord allows
[43:45] now
[43:48] why is it this why is this age this age
[43:51] why is it like this
[43:55] in Daniel 12 and 3.
[43:57] and they that be wise shall sign shall
[44:00] shine as the brightness of the firmament
[44:01] and they that turn many to righteousness
[44:03] as the Stars forever and ever but thou
[44:05] will Daniel shut up the words and sealed
[44:07] the book even at the time of the end he
[44:09] says many shall run true and fro and
[44:11] knowledge shall be increased
[44:16] why is it a nervous age why is there so
[44:19] much stress and pressure and anxiety
[44:22] because knowledge has increased
[44:27] there's so much to know
[44:29] 150 years ago when our grandpas
[44:33] were farm and wheat you know what their
[44:35] thoughts were every day
[44:37] roll out of bed Mama cooked some
[44:41] eggs and some toast no bacon go out they
[44:44] start pollen fields
[44:46] they start hole in the ground they hook
[44:48] up the the horses and get the plow going
[44:51] the Saddles riding horses this and this
[44:53] and
[44:53] dogs and feeding chickens
[44:56] pretty simple stuff
[44:59] now when I'm on a job site I just lost
[45:01] my glasses
[45:03] when I'm on a job site
[45:04] I've got 500 fittings to think about
[45:07] I've got to reroute my mind where this
[45:09] is going where this is going and I gotta
[45:10] deal with the Sparky I gotta deal with
[45:11] the tin knocker I gotta deal with the
[45:12] superintendent he didn't like this
[45:13] valuation so I got to shoot it up I got
[45:15] to redo it tear it out this this and
[45:16] you're a thousand different fittings
[45:19] in an hour then I got an apprentice who
[45:21] doesn't know anything
[45:22] green is the grass
[45:24] hey sigh what about this I said bro you
[45:26] got to measure Off the Wall not off this
[45:28] he's like oh yeah and I'm like well it's
[45:31] an easy fix just unscrew this and
[45:32] measure this get your Center centers
[45:33] take off your takeoffs do this this
[45:35] throw it in there he's like okay sorry
[45:37] about that keep going bro
[45:40] what knowledge shall increase what does
[45:41] knowledge have to do with anything
[45:42] notice what the Bible says here
[45:43] Ecclesiastes 1 and 18 for in much wisdom
[45:48] is much grief he says and and he that
[45:51] increases in knowledge increases in
[45:53] sorrow
[45:57] for the last two thousand years every
[45:59] age every person thought it was the end
[46:01] time
[46:02] they literally thought that yeah
[46:05] but they didn't know
[46:07] now
[46:09] we know
[46:10] It's The End age
[46:13] when I come out of my first two three or
[46:15] four Bible studies and they broke the
[46:17] prophet and serpent seed and baptism
[46:20] my mind actually got numb
[46:23] we had the spiritual Amnesia lifted off
[46:25] and I'm like
[46:29] or This Is the End
[46:31] this is it God has already sent his
[46:35] prophet
[46:36] at the time 40 years ago
[46:45] and the pressure now
[46:47] you see no other age has this pressure
[46:49] nobody age knew it was the end
[46:52] can literally prove it through scripture
[46:54] can prove it through what the tapes can
[46:56] prove it through the videos of what the
[46:58] discernment line showing what the gift
[47:00] the the the uh the Messianic sign right
[47:04] there brother Jesse does the videos on
[47:06] it 15 signs and one one to Servant
[47:12] okay four has already come and gone we
[47:14] have the restoration of the word of God
[47:15] the Bible is brand new book
[47:19] [Applause]
[47:21] we know the Rapture is Among Us coming
[47:27] with much increase in knowledge
[47:28] increases sorrow
[47:30] the stress the worry
[47:33] we have loved ones
[47:36] our brothers our sisters our moms dads
[47:39] our cousins our uncles and aunts
[47:41] and we know there is coming a part we
[47:43] understand the the original mystery that
[47:45] Paul brought what was his mystery what
[47:48] the Gentiles had a dispensation what to
[47:51] open the door of Salvation to the gospel
[47:53] the Gentiles were given and they entered
[47:55] in we received the Holy Ghost right then
[47:58] but we also know that the Gentile
[48:00] dispensation is going to have a door go
[48:02] shut
[48:03] and at that time
[48:06] he that is filthy is filthy still he
[48:09] that is unjust is unjust still he that
[48:11] is righteous is righteous still and he
[48:13] that is Holy is Holy still amen praise
[48:15] God
[48:17] we know there's a cut-off time
[48:19] and we know it'll be an hour a day
[48:27] and here's our here's another big sign
[48:30] when you see that fig tree
[48:32] blooming right
[48:35] but remember God sets the stage for
[48:38] everything
[48:44] I'm going to read you a story here about
[48:45] this
[48:47] in 19 wasn't 1947-46
[48:50] Israel became a nation
[48:53] what happened right at that time World
[48:55] War II right
[48:57] Hitler Rises up
[48:59] put all these Jews in the ghetto put
[49:01] them in concentration camps and this and
[49:03] this and this and all that sort of thing
[49:05] and the Bible prophesied they go back to
[49:07] their Homeland right
[49:11] so how did this work
[49:13] end of World War II the Allies come in
[49:16] save the Jews and all of a sudden they
[49:18] just fly to Israel and it's they take
[49:19] over
[49:21] did they take over right then
[49:24] no
[49:25] now they got Jerusalem back in 1967.
[49:29] but when did Israel get Israel back not
[49:32] necessarily become a nation but when did
[49:33] they get it back
[49:36] let me tell you something we were
[49:37] talking about restoration
[49:39] we have nothing to worry about let me
[49:42] read let me let me read this to you how
[49:43] did this but just might know he's very
[49:48] look at this
[49:49] program actually talked about this not
[49:52] crazy just
[49:53] I I really you misunderstood me
[49:56] [Laughter]
[49:58] Brothers yes you know what I mean right
[50:02] sorry my Humanity
[50:05] he says the moment foretold and the
[50:07] strategy given Isaiah 31
[50:10] this is right in World War the setting
[50:13] in the stage of World War II Jews coming
[50:16] into their Homeland started in World War
[50:18] One
[50:21] he says as the Turks were allied with
[50:24] the Germany or the Turks they ruled
[50:28] Israel and Palestine for 400 years
[50:31] they're the Muslims
[50:35] British found themselves fighting
[50:37] against the fading Ottoman Empire in the
[50:40] Middle East
[50:42] General Allenby was charged with
[50:44] liberating Jerusalem
[50:46] and had expressed concern to his
[50:48] superiors about the magnitude and
[50:50] sensitivity of the task before him
[50:52] they knew this was something special now
[50:54] remember God has appointed men in every
[50:56] position at the specific time for the
[50:59] specific reason and they are anointed to
[51:01] do what they are anointed to do amen
[51:04] God has low he's got little guys like me
[51:07] and then he's got great Generals in the
[51:08] world
[51:09] Wars given Powers command forces and to
[51:13] bring military this military to that and
[51:15] what God has ordained these men
[51:19] the Turkish Empire was controlled had
[51:21] control of Jerusalem the British were
[51:23] planning on taking over
[51:26] in preparation in the defense of this
[51:28] Invasion the Turks planned to seal up
[51:30] all the gates of the city and blast open
[51:33] the Eastern Gate in order to to create a
[51:35] fortified secret supply line entrance
[51:38] that would come down into Jerusalem from
[51:40] the Kidron Valley and up through the
[51:42] Eastern Gate in order to create the
[51:44] supply line they were to blow open the
[51:46] sealed Eastern Gate and break an ancient
[51:49] biblical prophecy
[51:51] Isaiah 44.
[51:53] one and two
[51:55] then he brought me back to the outer
[51:57] gate of the sanctuary with which faces
[51:59] towards the east but it was shut
[52:01] and the Lord said to me this gate shall
[52:03] be shut it shall not be opened and no
[52:05] man shall enter by it because the lord
[52:07] of the God has entered by it therefore
[52:09] it shall be shut
[52:11] the Turks that were commissioned with
[52:13] this task were captured
[52:16] the ones that were supposed to blow up
[52:17] this East Gate were captured and stopped
[52:20] just hours before the bomb could be
[52:22] ignited
[52:25] he had been ordered to take the city now
[52:27] this is back to the general ellenby who
[52:29] had been ordered take the city without
[52:30] firing on the people on the city how is
[52:33] that going to take place
[52:34] you know the wild men
[52:37] how are they going to take this city
[52:40] but he was ordered to do that
[52:43] remember it looks impossible
[52:46] uh what
[52:48] if God gives you a command
[52:50] remember everything that takes place of
[52:52] you was God ordained
[52:54] everything that was given you to do was
[52:56] God ordained God has earned the
[53:00] footsteps of the righteous
[53:02] how on Earth could this be done pray the
[53:05] answer came from above which perhaps did
[53:07] not seem to be very helpful at the time
[53:09] but Alan B did pray he came across the
[53:13] work a Bible scholar Dr H elderson
[53:16] eldersmith who had been studying the
[53:19] prophecies regarding Israel
[53:21] Adler Smith explained in his book from
[53:23] 1898
[53:25] that he believed Jerusalem would be
[53:26] delivered by Great Britain in nineteen
[53:29] 17. how do you come up with that
[53:32] remember every age has scripture they
[53:34] have to fulfill
[53:37] Josh do you ever study uh Isaiah 3 and
[53:41] Isaiah Isaiah 31 and say well this is
[53:43] this is British
[53:46] but I tell you what they never looked at
[53:47] Revelation 13 and said this is America
[53:49] either
[53:50] they didn't know the one that came out
[53:52] of the water was Rome and the one that
[53:54] came out of the Earth was America amen
[53:55] praise be God they didn't know what the
[53:57] the the mystery of Babylon was the
[53:59] Catholic Church
[54:00] but that was for our day
[54:03] the Mysteries
[54:06] he says he believed Jerusalem would be
[54:08] delivered by Great Britain in 1917 he
[54:11] had become convinced from Isaiah 31 3-5
[54:14] that the UK would play a part in the
[54:16] restoration of Jerusalem now notice when
[54:19] was this 1898
[54:21] and that it would be accomplished by
[54:22] some kind of flying machine and he got
[54:25] that from the scriptures
[54:28] what does it say
[54:32] for those saith the Lord spoken to me
[54:33] like a lion the young lion roaring at
[54:35] his plate when a multitude of shepherds
[54:37] is called against him he will not be
[54:38] afraid of the voice and there's this as
[54:40] as birds flying not birds flying as
[54:44] birds flying so will the Lord of hosts
[54:47] defend Jerusalem he says defending also
[54:51] he would deliver it and passing over he
[54:53] will preserve it
[54:55] and this doctor from the 1890s said this
[54:58] is going to be Jerusalem he's going to
[55:00] use British to do it
[55:03] prophesied
[55:07] Elder Smith had arrived at this idea
[55:09] idea even before the Wright brothers
[55:11] took their flight in 1903.
[55:14] saints of God God is in full control
[55:16] be not shaken in mind or
[55:19] discouragement or this or that and well
[55:21] they can do this and they can do that
[55:23] doesn't matter
[55:25] it doesn't matter to God
[55:27] Lord Jesus Christ he's laughing he's
[55:29] mocking them up in heaven right now he's
[55:31] who are you
[55:33] I am the Creator of heavens and the
[55:36] Earth
[55:38] but of course that is precisely what
[55:40] ended up happening 14 years later in
[55:43] 1917 planes were used but not most
[55:45] commonly but most not commonly but most
[55:48] people have never seen one
[55:50] this man's conviction about Isaiah 31
[55:52] was allenby's inspiration he would fly
[55:55] planes planes over Jerusalem and drop
[55:58] notes written in Arabic saying
[56:01] surrender the city Allenby
[56:04] so we'd fly the planes and just drop
[56:07] these notes from that scripture
[56:10] well brother side what took place let's
[56:12] keep reading
[56:14] in the meantime General Edmond Allen
[56:17] being his troops were getting into
[56:19] position to apprehend Jerusalem Ambi was
[56:21] known by the As a Christian and follower
[56:23] of the Bible
[56:25] a great military man in the British Army
[56:27] in the early 1900s was a Christian and a
[56:29] Bible believer
[56:32] it is reported that the night before the
[56:34] invasion
[56:36] and be prayed that he might take the
[56:37] city without destroying the holy places
[56:39] he had wired London for instructions and
[56:42] to received a scripture verse as a reply
[56:45] that's where we got the scripture verse
[56:48] amen he was so excited
[56:52] about this verse that he read it aloud
[56:54] before all his troops that were
[56:56] positioned in the foothills of Jerusalem
[56:57] El be commanded
[57:00] command and deared every available
[57:02] aircraft to do flyover
[57:04] on the morning of December 10th what
[57:06] seemed like hundreds of planes skirted
[57:08] low over the Temple mount
[57:11] when the planes went up a cloud cover
[57:14] covering hid them so they were not seen
[57:18] so now God comes into play
[57:21] it says as Birds but when the Amish the
[57:25] ottoman Turks looked up they didn't see
[57:26] anything but they heard all the snowys
[57:30] all they heard was noise Flyers were
[57:33] dropped that said surrender immediately
[57:34] you don't have a prayer and were signed
[57:37] by Allenby what the general did not know
[57:39] is that the Turks believed in an old
[57:40] prophecy that they would never lose the
[57:42] holy city until a man of Allah came to
[57:45] deliver it he says according to reports
[57:48] the signature of Allenby on the paper
[57:49] drop from the sky was interpreted by
[57:51] them to mean the words Allah in an
[57:53] Arabic language meaning God and Brad and
[57:56] Arabic means son the son of God
[57:59] foreign
[58:00] the Turks were looking at a demand to
[58:02] surrender signed by Alabama
[58:05] the Son of God in response they hoisted
[58:07] the white flag and surrendered City
[58:09] without his firing shot
[58:10] [Applause]
[58:13] what is Israel Israel are the Servants
[58:16] of God and who are you but the Sons and
[58:21] Daughters of Jesus Christ I don't call
[58:24] you service I call you my sons amen you
[58:28] are the bride
[58:33] this was all set up so that when Hitler
[58:36] got done massacring the Jews those that
[58:38] were left had a place to go amen praise
[58:40] me to God we drew them at the
[58:43] propagation with a tender hand he drove
[58:45] him back but he had a place to prepare
[58:46] for them amen
[58:49] praise God
[58:55] using Gentiles for the restoration of
[58:57] Israel
[59:05] just a little bit for God's wonderful
[59:08] people as servants
[59:10] foreign
[59:17] this was an incredible incredible
[59:19] fulfillment of biblical prophecy which
[59:21] put Israel under Jewish man or British
[59:23] mandate this mandate called the Balfour
[59:25] Declaration called for a Jewish homeland
[59:29] not a state
[59:30] for the Homeland not a country but a
[59:32] Homeland
[59:34] and set the foundation for modern Israel
[59:37] Jerusalem had been under Muslim control
[59:40] for centuries
[59:42] after the Turks surrendered General
[59:44] Allenby mounted off his white horse
[59:49] why he did not want to fulfill the
[59:51] scripture
[59:53] the prophet God said all of the Jews
[59:55] indeed is to see a prophet
[59:57] and the prophet I just listened to last
[59:59] night he said I had my ticket I was in
[1:00:00] Cairo and I was going to Jerusalem he
[1:00:02] said I was going to display this gift
[1:00:04] and the Holy Spirit said don't you do it
[1:00:07] he says I'm gonna go anyhow I said don't
[1:00:09] do it
[1:00:10] turn back to the window people
[1:00:13] airplane says I gotta change my ticket
[1:00:14] yeah but you already scheduled to go
[1:00:15] here he says I need to change it I'm
[1:00:17] going to somewhere else now
[1:00:25] The Turk surrender General and it'll be
[1:00:26] mounted off as white horse as he enter
[1:00:28] Jerusalem through the Jaffa gay interest
[1:00:30] because he knew from the Bible that old
[1:00:32] and the Messiah will enter the city on a
[1:00:34] white horse
[1:00:37] oh yeah look at the reverence by that

[1:04:22] Saints
[1:04:23] if we are which we are the generation or
[1:04:27] those that go into this Rapture he is
[1:04:29] going to keep our paths
[1:04:33] our promise what is our promising stage
[1:04:34] there is a people who will not see death
[1:04:38] one of the greatest promises there is to
[1:04:40] ever given to a people
[1:04:43] Elijah never was prophesied that Elijah
[1:04:46] would not see death or even Enoch
[1:04:48] it just came to him but remember what
[1:04:50] was that God what was God doing at that
[1:04:51] time he was writing his story through
[1:04:54] people
[1:04:56] he would literally harness on to an
[1:04:58] individual
[1:05:00] and them not even knowing what they're
[1:05:01] doing
[1:05:03] and he would guide him this way in this
[1:05:05] way and this way and that way and they
[1:05:08] don't even know why their life is going

[1:09:32] own will the human will
[1:09:35] of I don't want to die
[1:09:38] but then the Bible said with joy
[1:09:40] he went towards it once he died of that
[1:09:42] he says
[1:09:45] I'm going to suffer
[1:09:46] but the result is going to be
[1:09:48] magnificent
