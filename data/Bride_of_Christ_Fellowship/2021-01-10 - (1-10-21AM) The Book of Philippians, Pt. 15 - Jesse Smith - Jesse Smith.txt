amen praise God let's stand and take our Bibles here let's go to Philippians chapter 4 like to continue on this thought I'm going to just try to preach about 40 minutes on Philippians and then we'll I like to stop the live stream and then just just share some things about you know the political situation and uh just you know some things that I probably would rather not go on live stream just because of uh the system right the Big Brother system they're all listening and uh just I just want to share some things personally from my heart to the Saints so let me just preach a little bit on uh Philippians then Lord willing we'll get to uh just you know some reactions uh to this week you know it's amazing you know the whole world can be in turmoil and yet we can have peace yes that's right praise God like we're we're affected by it we see it but then when we come to the house of God or when we come to prayer it just seems like like okay like I went to the store this morning and bought those groceries I'm like everything's okay everybody looks all mad you know and I'm just happy I'm like excuse me you know like we're we got our carts and I'm like oh pardon me excuse me you know everyone's like okay but it's just the peace of God that passes all understanding amen and we're grateful for that you know and it's not anything that we've done it's just you know surrendering to the holy spirit so we're thankful for God's grace Philippians 4 uh let's start at verse eight now I keep thinking you know we'll get done with it today we'll get done with it today and as I study things just I like to go slower through these scriptures and um it just seems like I just want to stop and I want to emphasize each point this has been I think a very timely series for us you know Paul is in the midst of being in prison and yet he finds so much joy he is so full of God's joy that he's encouraging others who are not in prison to have joy and contentment and what a great lesson for us to be content in this hour praise God content with the Holy Spirit Philippians 4 uh let's read 8 and n and then we'll do our memory verse my choice would be uh 1st Samuel 17:47 but let's read Philippians 4 8 and9 let's all read eight and nine together ready one 2 3 finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things those things which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the God of Peace shall be with you praise God now let's go to uh 1st Samuel 17:47 this is just a memory verse uh I like I selected for this month ask the Lord to write it on the fleshly tables of our hearts no doubt we're going to have trials this year but the Lord will save us out of everyone if it's the year of his coming then we'll be saved through the Rapture praise God Amen if it's not then he'll save us and Deliver Us from all of our Temptations and trials amen lead us not in temptation but Deliver Us from Evil he's the deliverer he saves by his mighty hand praise God let's all read verse 47 1 Samuel uh 17:47 1 2 3 and all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the Lord's and he will give you into our hands amen may God has blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated praise God I do have some quotes here and some slides here I just want to mention and let me open this up in case I got to look up some Greek or Hebrew or something like that just comes in handy when we got to do that I trust everybody had a good week in the Lord uh by God's grace we got back to school this week so it was a nice week I'm just a little tired and worn out but uh feeling refresh after yesterday hope everybody's feeling refreshed today brother Johnny did you have to work yesterday brother oh praise God so hopefully you're feeling refreshed too brother Jose did you work yesterday buddy no brother good praise the Lord oh sometimes did you work yesterday oh praise the Lord Praise night Friday oh it's your Friday night well yeah well it goes into Saturday brother so it goes into Saturday I yes yes sir I understand so I'm glad everybody's feeling good uh that Saturday is such a day of uh such a needed day to kind of recover for me I don't know about you but it's such a a great day to recover and hopefully you're feeling strong today in the spirit of the Lord so I'd like to uh uh look at this thought like I said I'll set the timer now give me about 40 minutes here we'll try to uh look at Philippians here for a few moments uh how many remember where brother Bram said that we are resting on what Paul preached praise God I just always want to keep that at the for Forefront of our minds you know I imagine we'll go to Colossians after we finish this uh series here it's just been so wonderful to me you know at as you know just personally going through these books you know have been so perfect like when we went through Ephesians it was right at the time I was dealing with this uh brandom Tabernacle thing and emphasized the full ministry right and as I go through Philippians I see Paul defending the faith and that's what I've went through recently just defending the one Faith given to Jesus right or Jesus gave to brother brandham and so I just see how these scriptures just come alive and I hope you can see your life in these scriptures as well that's my great prayer that you will see and you will gain such spiritual benefits from these scriptures because this is what we're resting on praise God this is the gospel that if anybody changes one of these they're cursed so we must pay attention we must uh gain the insights that Paul is sharing uh as he got the revelation of this from Jesus Christ himself praise God and remember brother R said in the church agent book those that are in the bride are in the word all the way amen so we shouldn't get further away from the word we should get more into the word we must know what the word says praise God Amen now uh let's look at part 15 here probably have maybe one or two more part Parts we'll see it may stretch further we'll see what the Lord does but um he says those things both learned now look see how Paul Paul expected them to learn from the preachers praise God right like I expect you to learn something from the word that's preached whether it's me or brother cam or brother Keith Randolph or whoever it is expect you to learn praise God I expect myself to learn I don't want to be uh lazy each year I want to be more spiritually on fire each year praise God I want to be able to learn and say this year I'll be more diligent with this area of my life praise God even if even if it's just one more area I want to be more diligent with this area of my life yeah I want to learn how to draw closer to the Lord so Paul says you which you have both learned remember he was only around them maybe a few weeks or months at Max uh and this was 11 years prior to Paul writing this so most of the people in the church right probably didn't meet Paul at that point right it was 11 years later they never had a chance to meet him the church was steadily growing but he said those things which you both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the God of Peace shall be with you now Church did you catch that he he just said the God of Peace will be with you but two verses earlier uh he said the peace of God will keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus amen amen so he said in other words if you do what I'm telling you to do if you pray the way I'm telling you to pray Hallelujah if you act and learn those things I'm telling you to learn if you put this gospel into action then God's peace will be with you praise God you'll feel it uh in your mind you'll be uh you have a peaceful State about you praise God you won't be in turmoil all the time you'll have peace and he said then the God of Peace will stay with you Amy amen so Paul was and here's a man remember writing this from prison he's writing this from prison and he can have peace being a slave right he can have peace being a prisoner he doesn't have free more he doesn't have free will to go talk to whoever he wants to talk to he can't go call his mom right if his mom was still alive he couldn't go talk to his dad he couldn't even go to the store so look church we have so many freedoms and Liberties if a man in prison can have peace with God so can we amen he didn't have the free all he had to do was really the freedom to eat and get gifts the the Bible says we'll get to here he did have freedom to receive some gifts just like you know I've sent some gifts to people in prison from time to time you know or little monetary offerings or something like that you can give them gifts and so forth he had the freedom to get gifts uh thankfully he had the freedom to write letters and send them out thank God Amen look at that even in the midst of Satan trying to lock him down he couldn't stop the word of God see Church the God's word will never be stopped amen as much as they try to do it they'll keep trying they they'll never be able to stop God's word it's living and active and Jesus said it will go all the way around the world amen amen to every Kindred Nation people and tongue you cannot Satan cannot stop this word amen glory amen my even the prison houses couldn't stop it and they won't stop it yet praise God thank the Lord kind of getting into that Twitter thing now uh he says what things he said those things what things Paul the things that he mentioned previously in verse eight see not everything you see in a Believer you can you want to model right brother man he he says it numerous times he said be careful not to take your pastor's Spirit he says he said I go to many churches and the people act just like their Pastor that's why I like that I'm still probably the loudest shouter and screamer and I'm one of the few that dances from time to time you know like because you everybody's just letting me be me right and I'm letting you be you praise God right I like that that's nice Freedom praise God brother R said he go to many denominational churches and whatever the pastor does that's what they all do whatever the pastor says that's what they all say like just human things like human sayings and attitudes and he said instead of getting the Holy Spirit they're getting the pastor's Spirit right so I'm trusting by God's grace that Paul PA is saying and and we're saying that we're getting the Holy Spirit and not one another's spirit amen we're not getting each other's Spirit we're getting Jesus's spirit amen amen see there's variety right there's variety of flowers there's variety of Landscapes there's variety of all kinds of variety of nature Stars there's so much variety and so we have to have respect for all the variety in God's nature and also in God's people praise God Amen so we we want to have that by the grace of the Lord but Paul says what things he said those things you've seen in me what things the way Paul thought about true things the way he was truthful the way he was honest the way he was just and pure and lovely and a good report and virtuous and the praiseworthy things in Paul's life he said whatever you've seen about me heard about me that's these things he said do that praise God right right don't do the things that I do sinfully right don't don't mimic just my personality don't MIM don't mimic my human characteristics right and that's what that's what we've seen over these years since brother B left the message a lot of people try to wear you know they try to wear Eagle belt buckles like brother brandom or they they try to they try to hold their Bible just like brother brandom or they they're trying to impersonate brother Ram's physical attributes right they're trying to talk just just like brother Ram talked right they're trying to avoid uh maybe education or you know increasing their understanding uh just trying to physically be like him and they're trying to take brother Ram's human Spirit rather than the Holy Spirit that's right and the way you know is watch their life if their life gets more sinful they're trying to take brother Ram's human Spirit if their life gets more holy then they're trying to take the Holy Spirit praise God it's a great truth so Paul says those things which things the things that are pure and lovely all these things you've seen in my life he said do those things right uh because Peter could have said the same thing whatever you see in me do but does that mean we'd want to segregate and just have Jews and Gentiles no we don't want to imitate that right so so we understand that's what he's saying he he's not saying everything I do imitate that's not what he's say he said everything that's holy in my life everything you see Jesus do in my life that's what would you do praise God Amen Hallelujah so I just want to lay that in there I thought what what things what things is he talking about the things that are holy the things that bring God's peace amen when you see someone walking in peace that that's the peace you should have praise God right when when you see the peace of God flowing through other people's lives that's what you're supposed to imitate you know and that's what you kind of pick up in conversations with people you know like older ministers or maybe people like when somebody's on fire you know and you maybe you're not where you need to be right you just try to pick up and conversation well what you've been reading lately I don't know if you do it I do it you know what You' been reading what you've been listening to lately you know you try to pick up what's inspiring them amen because that's what Paul's saying these things that are in me the things that bring God's peace the things that bring God's power imitate that praise God or you have you see it all the time with preachers uh a preacher will catch inspiration and then that will inspire so many other preachers to keep studying and and preaching God's word you see all the time fact that's what's been going on for all these years we take one thought of brother Rand you can just run it all the way down through the Bible praise God that's what I've been doing in my whole Ministry praise God taking one little thought of brother RAM and seeing it go all the way down through the scripture see the things that we see we imitate that praise God all right now to me yeah all these eight things that you see Paul do or that you see men or women of God today do you want to imitate those things now remember most of the Philippians would have only heard of Paul's character because it would been 11 years since he visited remember so most of them just would have heard wow that's what a prophet of God lived like wow and that's what we do too when we listen to brother R Tes oh we hear that's what a prophet of God did that's how a prophet handled his finances or that's how a prophet you know corrected his children that's how a prophet dealt with teenagers that's coming up in my life right I got two of them right now I need to go play those tapes again I mean I might uh but you see how did Brother Bram handle it and you look and see uh and you try to gain wisdom and understanding from that example because that's what they did all these people had testimonies well Paul told me this or Paul prayed for me here or Paul did this Ah that's right I hear about what God did there oh so that's how I'm directing my life as well like I've seen people take it this far uh they said one time brother brandom uh was at somebody's house I think brother Wood's house I I can't remember the testimony and the the brother had a Bible laying there and the brother in his own house put brother bram's book on top of his Bible and brother Bram said no he said you don't put anything on top of the Bible now that that that's not a legalistic thing like if you ever stack something on your Bible you're backsliding you know but it's just an example of just just an idea of how we need to subconsciously honor the word of God now I thought the other way too the Bible's our foundation stone so if you're GNA Place anything on the Bible that's a pretty good idea too right because heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word will never pass away so see could go either way right it really could because the Bible's my Foundation what's your foundation my Foundation is the word of God there is no firmer Foundation than God's holy word so see just things so in other words in other words just find a way to reverence God in your home when you hear these things try to reverence it like the one time brother Jose and I were talking about brother Rams remember the three lights to know that you're in the will of God remember that we talked about that a few months ago that's a great suggestion you've heard brother Ram talk about that he told that to Perry green and so then we can try to apply that same thing to our lives it'll never disagree with the God's word it always uh uh be in the timing of God right and then the third thing you'll be able to do it you got to line up those three so see we hear these things but we got to make sure we do them and not just hear them how many here to do the word of God today amen not just here I just don't want to hear word I want to go out and do what I've heard amen see so we take the same idea not not everything that we hear like brother Ram like I've heard brother Ram let Joseph have a TV Joseph even said it I've heard Joseph say it brother Ram let Joseph have a TV out in Arizona because they were renting that house and it was the landlord's house so brother Ram didn't get rid of the TV now for me I won't let my kids have a TV but the same thing is they got tablets it's pretty close it's basically the same thing right so we got to be careful and say well no tablets here or only these apps and you got to control it praise God so see you got to have wisdom I don't know what was going through that TV I don't know uh I hope nothing bad you know so and we know brother BR put up a Christmas tree now for me I don't I I can't put up a Christmas tree okay because how I was raised but if you can do it and praise the Lord then hallelujah it's your Christian Liberty to do those things the main thing is always draw closer to Christ amen remember areas of Christian Liberty they will never impact you one way or the other as long as you're sincere because to the pure all things are pure right like if you reverence April 6 brother's birthday if you say that's like that's a holiday for me well then praise the Lord you know fast and pray and you know get closer to God but you know that that's fine that's your Christian Liberty to do that you know uh so I just you know you wna you just want to uh have the right Spirit about you right not not not not try to be better than people not trying to fuss with people but make sure the peace of God that you're living with can flow out to other people praise God see we've only heard of brother Ram's character from Witnesses and we hear it on tape now this is like this one this one is so personal to me like the character to leave everything you've ever loved to do the will of God so in 1963 remember brother Ram uh left Jeffersonville right and moved out to Arizona so he's out there 63 64 so three years he was out there and only got one invitation to preach can you imagine he's a worldwide renowned preacher he only gets one invitation to preach out there but see he was able to leave everything in order to do the will of God Amen and that's something we hear on tape and that's something we should apply to our lives no matter what the word of no matter what our desires are we must obey the word of God and do what God's calling us to do okay just like he said he said now he's talking about Moses and Paul going to have to the having to go to the Wilderness to write the Bible he said and the New Testament writer was drove by the author into the desert place to get the inspiration to write the New Testament and the books are seal with Seven Seals it would also require the same I believe in the last days to open these Seven Seals so if the writers of the Old and New Testament had to go the desert to get the Revelation but then God sealed it with Seven Seals the one who's going to uh tell the revelation of it has to go to the desert as well to loose the Seven Seals praise God right they wrote it but but the Bible was written but then spiritually it had Seven Seals not physically church this this physically didn't have seven seals on it it was always open but the spiritual understanding of it a man had to consecrate himself and get along with God Amen and by doing that God could loose the seven mysterious Seven Seals and now the Bible makes sense to us and now the Bible can be lived because there was so much confusion for all those Church ages right for six Church ages there was confusion in fact did you realize church only the first and last Church age have the right understanding of the godhead because tertullian he was a real saint but he was in the second Church AG him he cast out Devils he raised the dead but he's the one that coined the word Trinity but he was a real godly man I read about his life this summer I put I'm putting in the next book what a man of God but that was the second Church age and the Bible said remember in the first church age don't lose your first love right and so the church begin to Backside a little bit losing losing losing it was all God part of God's plan that seed that plant had to die and that seed had to be planted again and it had to it had to die in order to bring new life praise God that's God's plan for the church age it's a bride tree praise God it's a tree amen right but then you know the the second third fourth fifth sixth all these other Church agents h no three persons until the last amen praise God see and Jesus is Alpha and Omega praise God first and last the first church agent the last Church agents are the only ones who know God's true personality that he's one person amen oh my what a beautiful thing he said to leave what you hold dear to what you cherish and the little home that was given me by the people remember brother R left that home Joseph lives in it today we drove by it took pictures of it uh churches has donated thousands of dollars to build that home just for brother brandham and ma and brother Bram said I had to leave the home the people bought me to do the will of God how many ever been given a home out there anybody ever been given a home no mortgage oh that would been a great blessing huh missed out on that blessing no no no because God has a season a time for it praise God he left that house that he cherished a little home given me by the people and amongst my people and friends and a church that was flourishing as far as remember this is right this is right before the seals I mean they have so many people there uh all the people like brother Neville's daughter you can watch it on YouTube they said you had to get there at least two hours early just to get a seat but we can slip in here two minutes early and get a seat right what a difference what a difference two hours they had to stand in lines brother Neville's daughter you can listen to it he she talks to Lonnie Jenkins and then the kids had to sit up here right on and you there's pictures of it they had to sit right up here and all the adults out there and they were just you know how they were more be they better better behaved back then right before all this ADHD and tablets and TV thing slipped in there right all this GMO or yeah all this GMO food messing up your body sugar addicts and everything like that I eat every day it's so awful my these kids got these kids got learning problems and alls their lunches are are muffins uh sugar drinks Kool-Aid brownies and they wonder why they got problems my goodness it's just so sad it was flourishing I mean there's just people flacking in and just they had to expand it remember they had to expand the Tabernacle in order to build it and God so he looked down and say oh I'm getting blessed on my church souls are getting saved they baptized a 100 people in the seals remember that brother Jose over 100 people they baptized new converts and God said time to leave oh it's in the middle of growing oh it's flourishing oh we're putting forth our buds time to leave I got a different calling for you but said I wasn't called to be a pastor because I got a rambling Spirit right now I hope I don't ramble on about things right I hope I don't have a rambling spirit that way but I know I don't have a rambling Spirit to leave I like I like being home I like fixing up our home I like staying in one spot I like my drive to church yeah I like it it's it's fine with me I mean I want to do missionary work eventually but I like my life I enjoy it I can stay right here people come people go love everybody you know try to help people love people do all you can do brother said I didn't have the pastor spirit I had a missionary Spirit praise God Amen he said nothing lacking to leave that to pull away from it and move away into a desert where you knew nobody and everything against you so everything was open arms in Jeffersonville oh brother yes yeah brother let's have all kinds of meetings right out in Arizona all closed doors he goes on to say but there's something about God that he drives a man to do things Beyond any thinking of his own so it can be for the glory and honor of God and I feel that not self honor I feel a privilege that was to leave to everything that was called dear to me to get here in this Wilderness and S suffer like I've never suffered in my life here in the wilderness or this desert but I believe that in doing that and obeying what God commanded to be done God has opened to us the mysteries of the last day and we are here with this message if we had not left we wouldn't have the revelations that we have today praise God in other words we wouldn't enjoy the blessings of God we'd be living a denominational life if he had not left his home right and everything comfortable and all the riches and you know just all the blessings if he had not forsaken the blessings we wouldn't have the blessings what a lesson for us God help us to sacrifice today that others might experience the blessings of God what a lesson he left a flourishing church and flourishing all didn't lack anything everything I needs there to got to the place where he's all alone many times God will do that to you gotta get you alone praise God so you can hear the voice of God how many appreciate that there's so many voices out there God has to get us alone so we can hear one voice the Holy Spirit you of course through the five-fold ministry now this is a different message a prisoner he said just like Paul both of them trained he said Moses and Paul were trained the same way you you know to deliver the children of Israel by military might Paul trained to take them out of the hands of the Romans and put uh put them free by his great ecclesiastical force in the world that day great schools of training come up under gamea and both of them went into the desert come back different men both of them saw the pillar of fire and both of them were prophets is that right both of them prophets and they was both talked to by the pillar of fire exactly right coming for a deliverer there they was went in the desert left their homes and went to the desert to find out left their people and everything to find the will of God Amen what are we willing to do to find the will of God we must be willing to forsake everything amen that's the only way to find the will of God he said because he said if you want to save your life you got to lose it he said to find your life to save your life you got to find it praise God right you got to lose your life in order to find eternal life praise God and it may be contrary to all you've ever thought this is scripture Paul's saying these things you've seen in me do that in other words be willing to lose everything in order to find the perfect will of God he said they were trained in one way God changed it trained them to another another they had to become a complete prisoner to not act in the way that they wanted to act but act in the way that God wanted them to act he's the same yesterday today and forever how many think God's going to have to do uh make us prisoners in order to go in the Rapture yeah we have to go through maybe tougher times we have to learn to maybe sacrifice some more in order to be fully prisoners fully obedient to do the will of God hallelujah amen God's going have to take us out of what we think and he's going to have to place us into his perfect will we're going have to deal with some squeezing right we have to deal with a little bit of squeeze a little bit of pressure we all feel it at times but we're have to go through the pressure in order for God to get out of got get out of our Lives what he wants to get out of our Lives now Paul says here verse 10 let's move on here to this thought I got 20 minutes on this little F first portion here so I'm going to preach a double header this morning praise God he said verse 10 but I rejoice in the Lord greatly that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again wherein ye were also careful but you lacked opportunity now here is my thoughts on this the Philippians had at least twice given to Paul his Necessities previously recorded in 2 Corinthians 8 and N9 and Philippians 2 25 through3 so while we're in Philippians let's go to Philippians 2:25 let's read about that so Paul's uh needed things on numerous occasions and they' they've sent word now can you imagine that think of the miles and the boat travels Church think about the travels oh Paul's in a Roman prison now Rome's far away from that right Rome's far away from uh Philippi right it's far it's a quite a d it's quite quite a travel but they hear about it after all these we'd say weeks let's say weeks of traveling right weeks of traveling the news finally gets there we get we get news in a matter of seconds but theirs takes weeks and then they hear about it now look how look how God was making Paul patient he had to wait weeks and months to get what he needed weeks and months and we get upset if we don't get an email reply after a few minutes right he would have to wait months and weeks in order to get the food or the the the Garment or the clothing or the parchments that he wanted right so they they' relay it they'd have Messengers go and then have to wait months and and get get whatever needed and then send it back so Philippians 2 25-30 dear Jesus make us more patient praise God Amen make us more patient yet I suppose it necessary to send to you epaphroditus my brother and companion in labor and fellow Soldier but your messenger so see this edtis he was the messenger he was the go between man between the church and the prophet praise God and he that ministered to my ones okay verse 26 for he longed after you all and was full of heaviness because that ye had heard that he had been sick for indeed he was sick nigh unto death but Paul I'm sorry but God had mercy on him and not on him only but on me also l I should have sorrow upon sorrow I sent him therefore the more carefully that when you see him again you may Rejoice that I may be the less sorrowful wow so Paul was going to be happy once they saw epicodus his messenger so Paul said just pray for him and just wait to receive epitus he he remember oh my can you imagine that edtis was carrying the message of the hour he was carrying this book of the Philippians amen he carried the Scrolls and the parts oh he had treasure and vessels praise God right because they packed him in vessels and there epaphroditus is carrying the vessel that had the word it had thus say the Lord in it and church you and I are the vessels today we've got treasure in our Earth and vessels amen and we're just not packing the message the message is in US amen hallelujah there he was packing the message of the hour oh my we do the same thing with the word of God today don't we we pack the word of God we carry the word of God and that's what eper frodus was doing so again so one time with eper Fortis he helped now let's look at Second Corinthians you don't have to turn there because I just put a few up here now look at Paul right he's writing to the the city of Corinth now the church in Corinth he's saying more brethren we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia he Saidi like to tell you about the grace of God everybody say grace Paul's bragging about not I should say bragging but Paul's trying to point out to these Corinthians that the the the Saints in Macedonia have great grace upon them in other words he's trying to say look at this church you can learn something from this church right and we should be open to that too I want to learn I learn from cam Church often when I go there I oh I like how they do this and I like that my goodness right we want to learn from other churches now the Macedonian churches remember it's that whole area I got a few uh I got a few Maps let me show you some maps here okay so everybody can see this here's uh where's there's Jerusalem right so there's Israel Macedonia is that whole area where there's Berea thessalonica Philippi there's thyro tus there's Corin so think about remember he was in the uh yeah there's there's Corinth he's writing to the Saints of Corinth and there's Philippi I was looking for Rome am I missing Rome is it further west yeah sorry because it's the boot right that's where Italy's the boot so what a trip I mean if the boots way over here think about the trip to get the Philippi and send the messenger back that's quite a journey right without uh without your new Nissan right or your new uh Chevrolet right no air travel right no United Airlines back in those days they were men of God soldiers now I'm going to go back so Paul's saying I like to tell you about the grace of God that these churches in Macedonia have received verse two how that in great trial Affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality and other words their Hard Times their very hard times cause them to be more generous oh God our hard times I hope they make us more generous I hope they make us more giving especially to the Saints the Bible said especially when you see the Saints in the house of God uh do good to those especially those in church see Hard Times shouldn't make us bitter hard times should make us better better Christians right I took that line from TD Jake I heard him say that one time he said you don't you don't make you bitter they're supposed to make you better right in other words more holy praise God I don't know if that's what he was talking about but that's what I'm talking about they make us better servants right more humble Christians see so we can't say things are so hard I can't help anybody no we should say things are hard on me but I want to have Grace and I want to help other people because church is going to come down to this it's really not you and I doing it it's the Holy Spirit doing it in us if you can't do something and you know it's right you know what we need to pray give me more grace cuz Paul says it's the grace what allow these Philippian Saints to be so generous in the midst of their trials Paul says there are great afflictions you know being arrested and beaten the Bible said they were beaten on the house of Jason they were beaten on the house and say bring it out here bring them out here when was the last time somebody beat down your door for being a Christian it never happened to me they'll beat down my cell phone with evil text that's about it right or evil comments on YouTube that's about all they'll do to me but see their trials made them care and want to help out for the churches amen see they they knew they knew what it's like to suffer so they want to help people that are suffering praise God so Paul's saying now listen churches in Corinth you really need to see what Grace produces in someone's life look what it will produce it will produce a generous person everybody still believe this is thus sayith the Lord Philippians chapter 4 everybody everybody still believe that every everybody believe it still applies to us today every everybody believe we should still read it absolutely praise God absolutely because this is a day where we're rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing it's a selfish age so we need to be selfless like we saw last week I don't know brother John if you saw that message last week but my that was the Holy Spirit job was a basically a leot toan Believer he was rich and increased with Goods he said I'm at ease I don't have need of nothing and he said the Bible says that's why he had that was one reason why he had that great trial and look what it produced It produced more humility It produced repentance right amen It produced he was able to grow he was able to learn praise God through his trials now remember Philippi is the modern city Modern Day city of Greece it was this it's the second most populous area in Greece today so there's a modern picture from my iPhone right so there's Greece and there's Philippi so spelled a little differently there's thessalonica all those there's Athens yeah Paul preached down in Athens remember that Mars Hill acts 17 now remember Paul started this church by the vision remember he's sleeping and he sees a man from Macedonia say come and Minister he wanted to go to Asia but the holy spirit said don't go to Asia go to Macedonia now they hadn't heard the word so God has to send the man the prophet a vision go to these people and what are they going to become they're going to become the some of the most generous Christians the world has ever seen praise God Amen they never heard the gospel but God said all they need to do here is the grace of Jesus Christ and it will produce in them such a character that the next 2,000 years of church ages will hear preaching about such generous Christians in the midst of suffering they can be generous in the midst of trials they can think about other people instead of thinking about themselves praise God and God directed The Prophet messenger of that day to change his missionary plans don't go to Asia go to Macedonia go to these lost souls over here because really they're my children I've got children over there you need to go do missionary work over there and they're going to be some of the most generous people that you've ever met the grace of God upon their lives oh what's Grace unmar favor God's favor on you just because he's good amen oh the goodness of God Amen resting upon us hallelujah oh thankful for God's grace in my life amen oh thank you Jesus now there's another picture of it where you see this is the Macedonia area there's Berea remember the bans they were more noble than those of thessalonica because they searched the Scriptures Daily whether those things were so what Paul said you want to be Noble remember we looked at that a few months ago read your Bible study your Bible every day praise God you want to be a king and priest study the word search the scriptures find the will of God Amen never get satisfied with your knowledge of God keep seeking after God you'll be a king and priest un God see Paul could tell there's different cities different churches had different reactions to the word of God now no church was perfect right no church was perfect because even the Ephesus Church had said some things they need to correct right children obey your parents this is how marriage works and he laid out all these things stay in the spirit sing it sing hymns all the time stay in the spirit don't be foolish do the will of God be wise redeem the time right they they needed correction on things now look at this this is beautiful Paul magnifies I got eight minutes so bear with me here before we we transition a little bit Paul magnifies the grace of God forgiving giving is an area that Grace helps us grow in as well as Faith knowledge and Etc how many would say they want more faith I think everybody would raise their hand and say yeah I want more Revelation right well what's going to give that to you Grace God's favor so you humble yourself you repent you live you trust in God's grace trust in the blood of Jesus Christ well the grace of God will give you more faith right well not only that but look what Paul says more of her Brethren that to it the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia look what he says in verse 7even therefore now look the Corinthians are abounding right now like their church when Paul writes it they're abounding in gifts right the Bible said they're growing in faith utterance and knowledge and all diligence and in love to us see that you abound in this Grace also if you read chapter 8 Paul rebukes the Corinthians because they're growing in all these other gifts and knowledge but they're not growing in being generous praise the Lord this must be a deep message or something like that see they're growing spiritually their faith is well they want to see more gifts come to church and they pray for gifts every service but Paul says you need to grow in the grace of giving as well like those churches at Macedonia so see how every Church you're never going to find a perfect church right and the church said unless you're talking about the blood now that's different we're talking about remember you're perfect in heaven but you're imperfect on Earth you're never going to find a perfect Church on this Earth as far as everything they do is perfect but everyone is perfect in heaven Hallelujah see Paul looked at the churches he said I'm a prophet uh wow the cor the Corinthians they got some good gifts and they're really grown there but these Macedonian churches up north they really got the grace to give and see you guys could learn a lesson from them right like I remember years ago I learned that great lesson from Albi and how my wife was exped and they sent a truckload Andy and Eileen brought over a truckload I mean the whole back of the truck was full of frozen food so some of you probably sent it to us thank you you we were so I I was crying I was just I was blown away and we had just enough room in our both of our freezers to fit all that food in there and we had to leave some out in order to eat that night I thought wow I learned something look at the generosity but you know like you know you go to albian church you're GNA find people make fall short of the glory right you're gonna come to akan you're going to find people that fall short of the glory of God ah my hand's one of them I'm not right but the blood of Jesus makes us perfect in heaven amen oh see I love this because Paul could look at the church in Cam's church and say they're doing some good things there now they could need some help here the same Holy Spirit look at our church and say they're doing some good things here but they could grow here if if the Saints in akan are willing to learn oh my praise the Lord Hallelujah church so what are you going to learn for 2021 well it's probably up to the Lord right what the Lord brings across the pulpit right that's probably what we're supposed to learn but of course we're supposed to learn in our daily prayer lives as well how many of you have come up in the last year come up for a closer walk with God that was your prayer request I've done it I asked for the Lord a few when Simon was here last time I asked Lord help me to be able to get up early and in most days I've seen that now a couple days I slept then I was kind of ashamed of myself but my body probably needed it but I wanted a rededication of having my my morning rededicated to God and God was gracious I feel like he's answered my request but see Paul saying what's going to do this is Grace in order to get Grace you got to repent right when you repent you're forgiven God's grace extends to you amen praise the Lord so church that's you know that's what the Holy Spirit would have us to know too if Paul could see churches have different strengths and different weaknesses and he could tell them that then we should be able to hear the the voice of the Holy Spirit to today saying you're doing good in these areas but you could need some more grace in another area praise God so again does anybody get any pats on the back because of anything we we've accomplished no all we've done is repented and then God gives us more grace remember Paul said Paul said I labored more abundantly he said not I but the grace of God that was with me it's what causes you to labor Grace Grace causes you to labor so see church just keep that in mind the Corinthians M they they were you could look at them and they always had more knowledge they always had more faith but when it came to pulling out their pockets and giving the people oh we say we call them today a little more frugal right boy they could really pray and M I'm learning new things and this is deep and wi praise the Lord I'm learning all about prophecy and all about tongues I'm learning all about knowledge and wisdom when it came to helping out the church down the street a let them do whatever they want you know ah you always have the poor with you why should you help him out goodness my goodness see every church when you go there you're going to find trouble you're going to find little things but Jesus if we accept Grace it'll bring us up above some of those things and churches you know coming down to the Rapture we're g to get anointing where ain't going to find too much sin in the church anymore praise God we're going back to the day of Pentecost amen amen we're going back to that we're going back to ananas and saf praise God we're going back to the restored church right where sin God amen God would even wouldn't even let sin get in the church amen Ah that's what we're going back to praise God what's going to do it your building no my ability no it's going to be Grace amen staying with God's word receiving his word repenting and Grace will bring these things that we need each one and all the message churches that really love the Lord that are born again they'll receive all the grace that they need in order to become what God has called them to be like got to tell you I was you know just trying to encourage brother amen I was trying to encourage the church you know pastors come from preachers come from different churches they say Ma you you're all abounding in music really right that they can tell we're growing in the freedom of worship I've had three I mean every guest every guest preacher that's come lately said that well thank God for the grace there now let's keep growing in that but what are some areas other areas of Grace we can grow in are we as generous as we need to be are we really do we see more faith in our lives where's the faith are we seeing more knowledge are we as diligent as we need to be or could we have some more grace there how about love how about utterance are we speaking the word of God like we ought to or could we use a little more grace there oh I could use some more grace there like utter it to my neighbor right or utter it to my coworker I could use some Grace there to utter it there's my 45 minutes here um let me finish this thought here that's what I my famous last word right yeah here's how you do it Church self sacrifice self-sacrifice is the only way to grow in God God's grace you got to repent amen because because Paul goes on to say this the Macedonian Saints did remember it was bereans Philippians Thessalonians they were so generous why not as we hope but first they gave theirselves to the Lord and then unto us by the will of God so before you can be used by God to bless people you first got to give yourself to God you got to say this is a season I'm G to devote myself to prayer this is a season I'm devote myself to just surrendering everything to God I'm gonna put everything else on hold and I'm just gonna seek God right now and see what he have me to do and then watch what he anoints you to do praise God you got to give yourself to God first right like Romans 12 put yourself on the altar right and then he'll transform your mind by the renewing of the holy spirit it's a beautiful Story I mean it's beautiful to see how the book of Philippians is tied in with all these other letters he's I never knew that he's bragging about the Philippians I didn't know Macedonia was you know pH Philippi thessalonica he's bragging on them because the but not really bragging on them he's bragging on the grace of God that's what I'm trying to say hallelujah the grace of God was so effective in their lives that Paul was telling other churches about the grace working in their lives praise God uh I'm G stop right there okay now I got a quote here everybody take a deep breath every can everybody take a deep breath God bless the live streamers have a great day by God's grace love the Lord with
