[33:31] [Music]
[34:23] [Music]
[35:27] you know that I mean we were in his mind
[35:30] and then and he thought of us above
[35:33] everything else have your Bibles tonight
[35:36] turned with me I'll try not to be
[35:38] lengthy this evening in Ephesians the
[35:41] fourth chapter as I said we've been
[35:44] preaching at home a series on the
[35:46] characteristics of the Holy Spirit and
[35:49] wanting to see and know that we are the
[35:52] bride amend and you know when you are
[35:54] joined one with another they said you
[35:56] become bone of his bone flesh of his
[35:59] flesh and spirit of his Spirit and then
[36:01] you become one Amen with the bride and
[36:03] the bridegroom become one and with that
[36:06] thought in mind we've been preaching
[36:07] this series if we're one with him then
[36:09] the same spirit that he had would be
[36:12] found in each one of us I mean being
[36:14] living lived out through our lives and
[36:16] manifested in our lives and I want to
[36:18] continue all that thought this evening
[36:20] if you have your Bibles turn with me to
[36:22] Ephesians the fourth chapter Friesians
[36:23] chapter 4 beginning at verse 30
[36:26] Ephesians chapter 4 verse 30 see just
[36:29] what the Spirit would say under the
[36:31] church tonight a man ask that you would
[36:33] pray for me and the Lord would help me

[36:40] the word across the man in a timely

[39:20] give you the glory for it all in Jesus
[39:22] name amen you can be seated this evening
[39:25] amen I want to speak a thought tonight
[39:28] on forgiveness the spirit of forgiveness
[39:31] a man how many believes that Christ had
[39:33] a spirit of forgiveness in you amen you
[39:36] can't know the forgiveness of God and
[39:38] not know that he had a spirit of
[39:39] forgiveness upon him a man we read over
[39:42] the Psalms 103 psalm amen
[39:45] David wrote a song said blessed Lord O
[39:47] my soul and all those we bless His Holy
[39:49] Name bless the Lord O my soul and forget
[39:51] not all of his benefits a man how many
[39:54] knows we got a lot of benefits Amen
[39:55] there are through Christ Jesus tonight
[39:57] he says forget all of his benefits who
[40:00] forgiveth all thine iniquities he didn't
[40:04] say he just forgives some of them but it
[40:05] says he forgives all your iniquities
[40:07] what a benefit to know that God forgives
[40:11] all my iniquities you know I know
[40:13] what all my iniquities were I know what
[40:15] all my sins were I know what they are
[40:17] and to know that there's a God who could
[40:19] look at me and say they never they were
[40:21] never there in the first place that
[40:23] makes me feel good tonight
[40:25] amen that's the kind of God we serve
[40:27] that's the spirit that God had in him he
[40:30] says he forgiveth all thine iniquities a
[40:32] man who heals all thy diseases who
[40:35] redeemeth my life for destruction who
[40:37] crowns you with loving-kindness and
[40:39] tender mercy this is the Spirit of God
[40:41] we're looking at here who satisfy thy
[40:44] mouth with good things so that my youth
[40:45] is renewed like the Eagles then we go
[40:47] down to verse 10 it says he hath not
[40:49] dealt with us after our sins Oh aren't
[40:53] you glad tonight that he didn't deal
[40:55] with you after your sins if he dealt
[40:57] with me after my sins I'd be in Hell
[40:59] right now amen but he hasn't dealt with
[41:02] me after my sins he says nor rewarded US
[41:04] according to our iniquities it's not
[41:07] rewarded me according to what I've done
[41:09] I mean not not not giving me amen what I
[41:12] deserve Amen but he showed mercy and
[41:14] grace upon me tonight amen as the heaven
[41:17] is high above the earth so great is his
[41:19] mercy toward Mercy towards them that
[41:22] fear him and aren't you glad for the
[41:24] mercy of God
[41:25] how many knows the mercy of God tonight
[41:27] it's so great amen when you think of
[41:29] what he's done in here he says as far as
[41:32] the East is from the west so far have
[41:34] they removed my transgressions our
[41:37] transgressions from us in other words
[41:39] we're completely forgiven tonight him
[41:41] here aren't you glad for that hey man
[41:43] I'm so glad tonight that God completely
[41:46] forgave me tonight amen I mean there's
[41:49] no there's no there's no little thing
[41:52] that he's holding against me there's no
[41:54] little
[41:55] that is there a man in the background
[41:57] but when God looks down at me a man he
[42:00] says what sins are you talking about
[42:02] when he looks at me he looks through the
[42:04] blood of Jesus he says I don't see any
[42:07] CNC me I look at myself and I see my
[42:09] shortcoming I look at myself and I see
[42:11] my affairs amai but his brother branham
[42:13] said one time he said when God looks
[42:15] down upon him he sees that that that
[42:18] that covering of blood round about him
[42:21] he says and then when those sins I bet
[42:23] him I missed I missed moves are my
[42:25] mistakes amen
[42:26] when they would come to God he looks
[42:28] down and it he said those things go up
[42:30] and they hit that bumper like a bumper
[42:32] of blood and God never sees something
[42:34] mean I mean I'm glad for that tonight I
[42:36] mean I'm so glad for that he says he
[42:39] said that was the spirit that was in
[42:41] Christ he was a forgiver remember when
[42:43] they hung him on the cross
[42:44] remember he stood they died they brought
[42:46] one a malefactor I believe the Bible
[42:49] says he said they brought there was one
[42:51] mouth to mouth factor let him put him
[42:53] when they put him to death and there
[42:55] were they come to the place was called
[42:56] Calvary and there they crucified him the
[42:59] malefactors one on the right hand the
[43:01] other on the left hand and Jesus said
[43:03] Father forgive them they don't know what
[43:06] they're doing
[43:07] forgive them they don't know what they
[43:09] do he says then they parted on cast lot
[43:11] they've been so we see that it was this
[43:13] spirit was on Christ a man no matter
[43:15] what they've done to it no matter what
[43:17] it what it was what did what what's in
[43:20] that was come against him a man he
[43:22] looked down and he said Father forgive
[43:24] them a man who was he talking about when

[43:56] manifesting the Spirit of God amen and
[43:59] we come around and we look at the what
[44:01] God has done for us and if he was a
[44:03] forgiver maybe that same spirit
[44:05] forgiveness will be in our heart
[44:07] it will be in my life it would be in
[44:10] your life hey man it's not like I said
[44:12] this morning it's not how much we could
[44:14] shout or how long we grow our hair or
[44:16] what kind of a dress we wear or don't
[44:18] wear that that manifests whether we are
[44:20] the bride of Jesus Christ both of us
[44:22] both flesh was my spirit but if the
[44:24] Spirit of Christ is in us then we will
[44:27] have that same forgiving spirit in our
[44:29] hearts tonight
[44:30] how many knows that to me the tree that
[44:33] is the Spirit of Christ and I quoted
[44:35] this quote this morning but I got it
[44:37] wrote down here it says Oh what we need
[44:39] in jeffersonville is thousands of lived
[44:42] voices not your voice but the voice of
[44:45] Christ the Spirit of Christ speaking out
[44:47] of the bride of Jesus Christ he says
[44:50] speaking out the thunder of God
[44:52] thundering out the sweetness and
[44:54] holiness and purity and undefiled lines
[44:57] walking around the earth today without
[44:59] blemish yes sir real Christians how many
[45:03] won't be a real Christian this morning
[45:05] it said real Christians that Thunder
[45:08] against the enemy that's what thunders
[45:10] against the enemy he said he said the
[45:12] devil don't care how loud you can holler
[45:15] he said well I shouted I shouted and run
[45:18] around church he said the devil don't
[45:20] care how loud you can halt her the devil
[45:23] don't care how much you can jump
[45:25] he said the devil don't care how loud
[45:27] you can shout he said but what hurts the
[45:30] devil is when he sees that sanctified
[45:32] holy consecrated life to God amen
[45:36] that one who is full that's filled with
[45:38] the spirit totally consecrated life
[45:40] giving over to God when he sees that
[45:42] life he says he said that's what puts
[45:45] the devil to fly that's what shakes the
[45:48] Damned away man
[45:49] he stood always says he said with that
[45:51] hurts the devil to see that sanctified
[45:53] Holy life of God and he says you could
[45:56] say anything to a person like that do
[45:58] anything to a person like that amen
[46:01] offend a person like that maybe like
[46:03] they did Jesus Christ then you know what
[46:05] he said they just go right on amen and
[46:07] like it never took place
[46:09] I see more problems in churches because
[46:14] that spirit is not manifested than
[46:17] anything else
[46:18] amen I see that spirit
[46:20] I've been through church splits I've
[46:22] been through this that and the other
[46:23] thing and you know what I bet everyone
[46:25] goes right on worshiping God like
[46:27] everything's okay and they can't forgive
[46:29] their brother who lives right next door
[46:32] come on church it's the truth amen and
[46:36] when we see that that's not the Spirit
[46:38] of God it not to God was a headache
[46:41] forgiving spirit Father forgive them
[46:44] they don't know what they do hey man and
[46:46] whatever we wherever we find the Holy
[46:48] Spirit the true Holy Spirit in a person
[46:51] that same spirit will have to be in them
[46:53] too we can say we're Christians we could
[46:57] say we're bride but I can know I'm bride
[46:59] like I said this morning by that Spirit
[47:01] of Christ living out of me live voices
[47:04] in there
[47:04] that's what thunders out against the
[47:06] devil and spirit wherever the Spirit of
[47:09] Christ was a man wherever that Holy
[47:11] Ghost was in a person's life that same
[47:13] spirit manifest itself I don't have time
[47:16] to look at all the examples but I want
[47:19] to look at a few of those examples
[47:20] tonight we look at a man by the name of
[47:22] Stephen how many remember Stephen in the
[47:24] Bible we spoke of him this morning amen
[47:27] but when Stephen was being stoned to
[47:30] death here he was he was preaching the
[47:32] gospel to the ungodly the Gentiles and
[47:35] to the to the the Sadducees the
[47:38] Pharisees they met he would tell them
[47:40] you uncircumcised stiff necked he was
[47:42] and he said they couldn't take it a man
[47:44] they couldn't believe that he would
[47:46] speak to them like that but he was
[47:48] speaking the truth and love trying to
[47:50] get them to come to the knowledge that
[47:52] he had of Jesus Christ a man and he said
[47:54] when he was doing that hey man the Bible
[47:57] says that they were so cut down inside
[47:59] that they begin to Nash on him with
[48:01] their teeth they hated him they hated
[48:04] him without a cause here he was trying
[48:06] to love them amen trying to show them
[48:08] the error of their ways and what did
[48:11] they do to him they hated him without a
[48:13] cause and they couldn't forgive him for
[48:14] what he'd said - how many knows it to be
[48:17] the truth you know sometimes there's a
[48:19] preacher or maybe sometimes there's a
[48:21] brother or sister you go say something
[48:22] to somebody just trying to show them the
[48:24] error of their ways you know what they
[48:25] pump that's the way you feel I will come
[48:28] here again how my knows that he said
[48:32] that's
[48:32] the Spirit of Christ he said there was
[48:35] Stephen he says they were he was being
[48:38] he was being national of this teak
[48:40] because the people ABA couldn't take
[48:42] what he would say and what did Stephen
[48:44] do is that the Bible says here in acts 7
[48:47] the 55th chapter of Acts 750 first verse
[48:50] of Acts 7 he says he was being full of
[48:53] the Holy Ghost being full of her first
[48:57] time I want you to notice that the
[48:58] Spirit of Christ was upon him full of
[49:01] the Holy Ghost he looked steadfastly in
[49:03] heaven and saw the glory of God and
[49:04] Jesus standing at the right hand of God
[49:06] and he said behold I see the heavens
[49:08] open the Son of God standing on the
[49:10] right hand of God and they cried out
[49:12] with a loud voice and stopped their ears
[49:14] and ran upon him with one Accord in cast
[49:16] him out of city and stoned him and the
[49:21] witness was laid down to closer to the
[49:22] feet of a young man named Saul you know
[49:26] the story
[49:27] maybe Saul later converted to Paul idea
[49:30] and it says and they stoned Stephen
[49:33] calling upon the name of the Lord saying
[49:35] Lord Jesus receive my spirit a man look
[49:39] at the offense brought a death sentence
[49:42] pronounced against him notice though he
[49:44] says that Stephen being full of the Holy
[49:46] Ghost looked up and he said and he knelt
[49:48] down he cried with a loud voice Lord lay
[49:51] not this sin to their charge lord lay
[49:55] not this sin to their charge white
[49:57] because the Bible says he was full of
[50:00] the Holy Spirit and if the Spirit of God
[50:02] is in us that same Holy Spirit it'll
[50:05] have the same desire that Christ had
[50:07] that see reconcile to see forgiveness a
[50:10] man regardless of what you know or you
[50:12] don't know what he did to me you don't
[50:14] know what they said it didn't matter him
[50:16] II maybe look what we did to Christ look
[50:20] what we put him on the cross him and he
[50:22] still said Father forgive them a man
[50:24] they don't realize what they're doing Oh
[50:26] Church him and this spirit has got to be
[50:29] found in the bride of Jesus Christ
[50:31] tonight maybe I and there's more turmoil
[50:34] more problems because we struggle with
[50:37] this thing of forgiveness
[50:41] we can know tonight that that spirits in
[50:43] us we don't have to hope so we don't
[50:46] have to wonder about it and you're
[50:48] sitting right here tonight if you've got
[50:49] a problem with forgiveness whether you
[50:51] need forgiveness or whether you need to
[50:52] offer forgiveness a man you know right
[50:54] now whether you're right with God where
[50:56] that spirit is right with God or not the
[51:01] the Word of God says when the Spirit of
[51:04] God is there that same spirit that
[51:06] Christ had on the cross will be in us no
[51:08] matter what takes place
[51:09] how many knows to be the truth a man if
[51:13] we ever seen a person that could
[51:15] demonstrate this like the man by the
[51:16] name of Joseph remember Joseph in the
[51:19] Bible over in Genesis amen
[51:22] it may we find out that Joseph was hated
[51:24] of his brothers man he was treated wrong
[51:26] by his brothers he was sold off into
[51:28] slavery and you know the story how it
[51:30] goes I can't go back and do all all the
[51:32] picking up on this but when we find out
[51:35] that all the things than the offenses
[51:37] that his brothers and all the people did
[51:39] against him that hey man he still had
[51:42] that Spirit of God in him
[51:43] I mean knows he had to chose it was the
[51:45] perfect type of Jesus Christ to probably
[51:48] not say Amen so we find out that as he
[51:52] began to have all these offenses come
[51:54] against him any and every time they did
[51:56] he just try to make the best of it he
[51:59] just try to make the best of it a man
[52:01] and he never we never had that
[52:02] bitterness well up inside of him never
[52:05] one time church he made why because he
[52:08] had the Spirit of God in him we find out
[52:11] later on we find out he ends up in
[52:13] Pharaoh's Kingdom there and and he the
[52:16] Pharaoh has a dream and they're gonna be
[52:17] the seventeen years in the seven five
[52:19] years of the seven lean years I mean and
[52:21] so he goes and interprets the dream for
[52:24] Pharaoh how many knows the story I'm
[52:26] talking about maybe eight so he gets
[52:28] over there and he interprets the story
[52:29] from Pharaoh and he tells me not what
[52:31] you need to do what you need to do he
[52:33] says is when you get these seven five
[52:35] years he says you need to store up he
[52:38] said because there's seven lean years
[52:39] coming if you don't store it maybe it's
[52:41] gonna be devastating it's gonna be death
[52:43] to the people if it so that's the way
[52:45] the story goes but when it gets all done
[52:48] telling says here's what you got to do
[52:49] here's what you got to put somebody in
[52:50] charge make sure this had done to all
[52:52] that and when Pharaoh now notice that
[52:54] this was
[52:55] this was it a this wasn't a Christian
[52:57] this was people that were observing a
[53:00] man who had the Spirit of God in him
[53:02] maybe when they saw Joseph over I think
[53:04] it's in the forty first chapter of
[53:06] Genesis about verse 38 it says hey man
[53:08] what you need to do is you need to put
[53:09] somebody in charge of this you need to
[53:12] get somebody in charge of this program
[53:14] and Farrell looks at his people and he
[53:16] says can we put anybody else in charge
[53:20] rather than this man seeing that the
[53:21] Spirit of God is in him the Spirit of
[53:25] God they recognize that Spirit of God in
[53:27] here maybe and so we show the Word of
[53:30] God testifies in Tencent that the Spirit
[53:32] of God was in him like no other man is
[53:34] there any man like Joseph he said church
[53:37] I thought what was that is your perfect
[53:39] type of Christ is there any man like
[53:40] Joseph ami he said in Joseph a man was
[53:45] put in charge that he began to lay up
[53:47] and he begin to do all this and he begin
[53:49] to do what needed to be done I mean and
[53:51] we find out that a man when the fat
[53:54] years were over and the leaner started
[53:56] in that people started coming and Joseph
[53:59] was doling out the food he was doling
[54:01] out the good now remembers the story and
[54:04] when he got to a certain place a man we
[54:07] find out that his brother ended up right
[54:10] in his court begging for food how many
[54:14] knows the story they didn't even
[54:16] recognize who he was they didn't even
[54:19] recognize this Joseph that was their
[54:21] brother that they'd sold off into
[54:23] slavery and it came to a place where
[54:26] Joseph said food and I'm not gonna get
[54:28] in the whole store but you know the
[54:29] story how he sent food with them and
[54:31] they came back and he sent food with him
[54:32] again any money in their sacks and all
[54:35] that hey bet you know the story how many
[54:37] knows the story but what I want to get
[54:40] to in to the place where it came time
[54:42] when Joseph could not contain himself
[54:44] anymore and he wanted to reveal himself
[54:46] to his brothers a man when he got to
[54:50] that place we pick it over up in Genesis
[54:51] the 45th chapter and Joseph could not
[54:54] retain himself before all them there
[54:56] stood by him and he cried because every
[54:58] man to go out from him he says and there
[55:01] stood no man with him while Joseph made
[55:05] himself known to his brethren and
[55:08] he wept aloud Egyptian the phrase house
[55:10] heard it and Joseph said unto his
[55:12] brethren I am Joseph he does he said
[55:16] nothing my father yet live and his
[55:18] brethren
[55:19] all of a sudden realized oh we're in
[55:23] trouble now this is the guy that we sold
[55:26] into slavery this is the guy that we
[55:28] took his coat this is the guy we did all
[55:30] this terrible thing dude this is the guy
[55:31] that we hated without a cause just like
[55:35] we did Christ hated without a cause yes
[55:37] he says this is the guy we did all this
[55:40] to and it says they were troubled in his
[55:42] presence you know why they were troubled
[55:44] because in the world it's dog-eat-dog
[55:46] it's an eye for an eye a tooth for a
[55:49] tooth well what they didn't see a man
[55:51] that inside their brother Joseph was the
[55:53] spirit of Almighty God inside of Joseph
[55:56] a man they need not been troubled inside
[55:58] of Joseph was that spirit of forgiveness
[56:00] they made churches then the Bible said
[56:02] that you ever seen a man like Joseph who
[56:05] the Spirit of God dwells in a man he had
[56:07] nothing but that he had no choice but to
[56:09] forgive him because the Spirit of God
[56:11] was in and if the Spirit of God is
[56:13] enough we have the same forgiveness in
[56:15] our spiritual is that right
[56:18] he said Joseph came to his brother and
[56:21] he says they were troubled at his prayer
[56:22] and Joe said Abra come near to me I pray
[56:25] you and they came near he said I'm
[56:26] Joseph your brother whom you sold into
[56:28] Egypt don't you realize what I'm telling
[56:31] you I'm the one that's Feeny I'm the one
[56:33] that's doing all this stuff to you he
[56:35] says he says now therefore be not
[56:38] grieved nor be angry with yourself that
[56:40] you sold me hither for God did send me
[56:43] before you to preserve life maybe don't
[56:48] get graved about this God sent me before
[56:50] you to preserve life I thought to myself
[56:53] Jesus Christ was sent for the same thing
[56:56] amen to preserve life and he didn't hold
[56:59] it against me he didn't hold it against
[57:01] me that he was sent and had to give his
[57:03] life in my stead he didn't hold it
[57:05] against me he said frankly forgive them
[57:07] Lord how many know that Joseph's done
[57:10] the same thing that Spirit of God was in
[57:12] him amen
[57:13] to forgive his brethren and he and God
[57:15] said he said before me to preserve life
[57:17] he said now that's what I'm doing here
[57:19] you see the spirit of forgiveness a
[57:22] Benny
[57:22] a lot everybody that he could have hold
[57:24] it against his brother held against his
[57:25] book but he did he forgave them hey man
[57:30] how many believe God did the same thing
[57:32] for you and me
[57:33] oh why he had a lot that he could hold
[57:35] against me but he flanked Pratt
[57:37] flat flat forgave me of it all I mean
[57:41] but then you know anybody they thought
[57:44] well they still didn't know and they
[57:45] were going on and he continued to feed
[57:47] him and provide for their needs and he
[57:48] brought him down into the land brought
[57:50] his daddy down land you know the story I
[57:52] don't want to get into all that that the
[57:53] sermon itself but when they brought him
[57:56] down the land they lived together there
[57:58] peacefully in that spirit of forgiveness
[57:59] with upon Joseph and he and he spoke
[58:02] kindly to them hey man he forgave one
[58:07] another just as God for Christ's sakes
[58:09] forgave us he wants us to do the same
[58:12] thing that spirits in us but then find
[58:15] out that Jacob dies a man a man Joseph
[58:18] looks around and brothers he goes buries
[58:20] a day comes back and now they're really
[58:22] worried because they think it was all a
[58:24] put-on if this wasn't real they meant he
[58:27] was just doing this because daddy was
[58:29] here you know what sometimes we put on a
[58:32] real good face amen when somebody else
[58:34] is around but when it comes down when
[58:36] nobody else around we said I still have
[58:39] this little bitterness in my heart how
[58:41] many knows this to be the truth
[58:44] he said when Joseph's brethren saw that
[58:47] their father was dead Genesis 50
[58:49] he says Joseph will prevent your per
[58:52] venture hate us and certainly request
[58:55] requite us all the evil that we have
[58:57] done unto Him see he they were looking
[58:59] at it as the world looks at it today
[59:01] they were looking at a little I for an
[59:03] eye tooth for a tooth amen now he's
[59:05] going to get us a man he said and they
[59:08] sent a messenger Joseph saying my father
[59:10] did command before he died saying so
[59:13] shall you say unto Joseph forgive I pray
[59:16] you now the president the the trespass
[59:18] of thy brethren and their sin for they
[59:21] did unto thee evil and now we pray thee
[59:24] forgive the trespass of your servants of
[59:26] the God of thy father and Joseph begin
[59:31] Cohiba
[59:33] hey man what was it hey buddy begin to
[59:35] repayment that's that Spirit of Christ
[59:37] in him amen that spirit of love he said
[59:39] I can't believe you'd think this was a
[59:41] put-on I can't believe you would think
[59:44] this isn't real I can't believe that his
[59:46] brethren fell down on their faces they
[59:48] said behold where thy service he said
[59:50] fear not for him I omit in the place of
[59:53] God am I the one that's gonna bring
[59:56] judgment no it's not me to do this thing
[59:58] but he says as the spirit gods in me I
[1:00:00] just flat frankly forgive you for it all
[1:00:03] I mean how many knows he did you thought
[1:00:07] evil against me but God meant it to be
[1:00:09] good to bring to pass good as it is this
[1:00:11] day to save much people alive I thought
[1:00:14] to myself that's exactly what God did a
[1:00:17] man he flanked Frank frankly forgave us
[1:00:20] all that many people might be saved hey
[1:00:23] man he said I forgive you and then you
[1:00:26] thought you do you did this to me as an

[1:00:43] Christ and Steven and Joseph a perfect
[1:00:46] type of Jesus Christ brother have said
[1:00:47] Joseph was a perfect type of Jesus
[1:00:50] Christ how many know is that to be the
[1:00:52] truth he says he was born amidst his
[1:00:55] brothers hated of his brothers loved of
[1:00:57] his father a man and why didn't they
[1:00:59] hate him because he was a seer because
[1:01:01] he interpreted dreams because he had
[1:01:03] visions it made they hated him a bit why

[1:01:34] no we know we're just we can't help what
[1:01:36] the Spirit of God is on us hey man he
[1:01:39] said I noticed for a just cause they
[1:01:41] hated him and they suppose they've
[1:01:43] killed him and thrown him into a ditch
[1:01:45] he was taken upset
[1:01:46] right hand of Pharaoh just that Jesus
[1:01:48] was taking up a sit at the right hand of
[1:01:49] the Father he made a perfect type
[1:01:50] brother branham said of Jesus Christ no
[1:01:54] man come to Pharaoh except to Joseph no
[1:01:56] man come to God except through Jesus
[1:01:58] Christ a man is that right he says watch
[1:02:00] him he said watch him in his temptation
[1:02:05] there in prison hey man there was a
[1:02:06] baker and a butler one of them lost one
[1:02:08] of them was safe hey man
[1:02:09] bye Joseph for telling what would happen
[1:02:11] at Jesus one on the cross one thief was
[1:02:14] saved one was lost Jesus foretold it
[1:02:16] would going to be that way is that right
[1:02:18] a perfect type of Jesus Christ amen and
[1:02:20] notice when his brother he was rejected
[1:02:23] him and he was rejected he was given a
[1:02:25] Gentile bride Oh Church David aren't you
[1:02:29] glad he would give it a Gentile bride
[1:02:31] who would be bold and gold freshman's by
[1:02:33] spirit of spirit have the same spirit in
[1:02:35] here hey man he was given a Gentile
[1:02:38] bride rejected by the Jews received by a
[1:02:40] Gentile bride to fulfill the scriptures
[1:02:43] I'll take unto my people a gent out of
[1:02:45] the Gentiles for my namesake
[1:02:47] I think I'm not people a Gentile yeah
[1:02:49] out of the Gentiles for my name he meant
[1:02:52] there you are living right there in this
[1:02:54] day the very living Spirit of God right
[1:02:56] at the end time now shadows and types
[1:02:58] falling everywhere he says oh I like
[1:03:02] that he said it's a type of perfect type
[1:03:05] of Jesus Christ a man that type that
[1:03:09] said Father forgive them they don't know
[1:03:11] what they're doing he flat forgave us
[1:03:14] amen he flattened forgave his brethren
[1:03:16] amen
[1:03:17] without any without any strings attached
[1:03:21] so to speak it is and church if that
[1:03:24] spirit is in us if we are his bride in
[1:03:27] this hour that same spirit will manifest
[1:03:29] itself in our lives to our brothers and
[1:03:32] sisters just like the Word of God says
[1:03:33] here said we are he said let all
[1:03:35] bitterness and wrath and anger and
[1:03:38] clamour and evil speaking be put away
[1:03:40] from you with all malice amen don't
[1:03:43] grieve the Holy Spirit whereby you are
[1:03:45] sealed unto the day of your redemption
[1:03:47] if that spirit say you don't agree but
[1:03:49] with allowing those things to creep back
[1:03:50] into your life Church I'm not saying you
[1:03:53] don't have the Holy Spirit tonight but
[1:03:54] don't grieve it and then by allowing
[1:03:56] these things to come back into your life
[1:03:58] the Word of God
[1:03:59] say he said be kind one to another
[1:04:02] he said tender-hearted forgiving one
[1:04:04] another even as God for Christ's sake
[1:04:07] forgave you he said if that spirit was
[1:04:09] in you and you claim that spirits that
[1:04:11] we all claim to have the Spirit of God
[1:04:12] inside to be the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:04:14] we will have that same spirit of
[1:04:16] forgiveness in us how many know to be
[1:04:18] the truth I'm reading a little book came
[1:04:21] in it's written by a denominational
[1:04:24] preacher Amen I know that's a bad word
[1:04:26] and some people but I read a lot of
[1:04:28] books him in the little different
[1:04:30] commentaries and books I mean I love to
[1:04:32] read after Charles Spurgeon I've learned
[1:04:34] so much from him a man I love to read
[1:04:36] after these different authors and I'm in
[1:04:39] a book right now by a Charles swindoll
[1:04:42] him in you probably have heard him on
[1:04:43] the radio he's a Baptist minister I
[1:04:45] believe but he wrote a book called
[1:04:48] improving your servant in that book he
[1:04:50] had some stuff to say about forgiveness
[1:04:51] and it was really I thought wow that
[1:04:53] fits perfectly into this thought so I'm
[1:04:55] gonna share a couple of those thoughts
[1:04:56] with you tonight if that's all right
[1:04:58] amen I might not have it verbatim
[1:05:00] because I can't remember exactly what he
[1:05:02] said in the book but it was good and it
[1:05:04] expired me inspired me and I want to
[1:05:06] hope it does that to you tonight too
[1:05:07] amen but and I'll tell you what I get to
[1:05:10] those places but anyhow amen he was
[1:05:13] talking about forgiveness amen and when
[1:05:16] he talked about forgiving he said sooner
[1:05:17] or later we as Christians we'll all have
[1:05:19] to deal with forgiveness and we deal
[1:05:22] with it how we deal with it if we deal
[1:05:24] with it with the Spirit of Christ in it
[1:05:26] just shows what we are made of another
[1:05:29] one this shows whether you are a bride
[1:05:30] or not hey Ben whether it is you're the
[1:05:33] one that needs forgiveness or you're the
[1:05:35] one that needs to forgive there's two
[1:05:37] sides to the coin
[1:05:38] he said that spirit of Christ will still
[1:05:40] be in either decision that you make
[1:05:42] how many knows that to be the truth he
[1:05:44] said and then he went to the scripture a
[1:05:46] bit in Matthew the fifth chapter and I
[1:05:48] want to share this with you tonight him
[1:05:49] you he says therefore if you bring forth
[1:05:52] a gift to the altar this is if you're if
[1:05:55] you are the if you are the one that
[1:05:57] maybe has offended something like
[1:05:59] somebody by somebody it's something you
[1:06:00] said something you did or something you
[1:06:03] didn't do that you should have a mint
[1:06:04] and all of a sudden her brother is
[1:06:06] offended how many have ever done that I
[1:06:09] wish I had another hand
[1:06:12] but when you do that a man you need to
[1:06:17] you need to handle it in a certain way
[1:06:20] and here's where I think the problem
[1:06:23] lies and I want to I want to just talk
[1:06:25] about this a little bit tonight Indians
[1:06:26] that all right he says therefore Jesus
[1:06:30] said over in Matthew the fifth chapter
[1:06:31] he dealt with this very very subject
[1:06:34] therefore if you bring your gift to the
[1:06:36] altar and remember that has that there
[1:06:40] and and there remembers that thy brother
[1:06:43] hath ought against thee
[1:06:45] how many knows what odd is that means
[1:06:50] anything the slightest little thing
[1:06:52] brother Branham says ought is just a one
[1:06:55] place in the message brother Branham
[1:06:56] says ought is just a funny little
[1:06:58] feeling think about that it's not some
[1:07:02] great big sledgehammer aunt just the
[1:07:04] funny little feeling a little bit saw
[1:07:07] what that brother
[1:07:08] but that's sister you know he ever been
[1:07:10] there he says if you if you're a
[1:07:14] worshiping and you remember you have aw
[1:07:16] our brother has ought against thee it
[1:07:18] says leave thy gift before the altar in
[1:07:23] those days when they would come into
[1:07:25] worship in order to be accepted worship
[1:07:27] they would bring a gift a little
[1:07:28] sacrifice or a gift amen but church we
[1:07:32] have the the supreme sacrifice we don't
[1:07:34] have to bring a sacrifice a gift anymore
[1:07:36] we bring our sacrifices as a sacrifice
[1:07:39] of praise our sacrifice might be a song
[1:07:42] of worship and we come to worship God
[1:07:44] our sacrifice might be a specialist or
[1:07:46] what we gave a meant or how we sing out
[1:07:49] to God I mean whatever it might be your
[1:07:50] form of worshiping God when you come
[1:07:53] here
[1:07:53] amen to worship God or wherever it might
[1:07:55] be you go he says when you when you come
[1:07:59] to worship a man and you realize that
[1:08:01] somebody's got on against you he says
[1:08:03] you stop right there
[1:08:04] and leave your gift at the altar he says
[1:08:08] go thy way first be reconciled unto thy
[1:08:12] brother then come and offer your gift
[1:08:15] but you know what I think the problem is
[1:08:17] hey man we we have these little under
[1:08:19] toes and undercurrents and churches they
[1:08:21] man may I pray to God you don't have
[1:08:23] them here I pray to God I'm just
[1:08:24] speaking
[1:08:25] like a barking up the wrong tree but
[1:08:29] Church a man when I think of human
[1:08:30] nature I think you know it's a real good
[1:08:32] chance I mean we all could struggle with
[1:08:34] something like this and I'm not trying
[1:08:36] to point the finger but Jessie I'm not
[1:08:38] putting two finger nobody in your
[1:08:39] congregation but I wonder you know but
[1:08:42] spirit of God I had several ways I could
[1:08:43] ago and I was praying to my wife I said
[1:08:45] pray with me I know which way to go Lord
[1:08:47] show me which way to go and spear to God
[1:08:48] led me this way so I'm gonna believe
[1:08:50] that the Spirit of God wants this said
[1:08:51] tonight is that Alright so when I when
[1:08:54] you when you read it says stop before
[1:08:57] stop when you give before they alter
[1:09:00] stop right there but I wonder how many
[1:09:02] times we come to church and we know
[1:09:04] there's a little feeling you know
[1:09:06] somebody doesn't feel quite right about
[1:09:08] something that you said or something
[1:09:10] you've done and you go right ahead and
[1:09:12] just raise your hands they glory to God
[1:09:14] hallelujah sing the songs and you smile
[1:09:16] and you think so good it's contrary to
[1:09:19] the Word of God that worship is contrary
[1:09:23] to the Word of God that's not worshiping
[1:09:26] God in the spirit amen
[1:09:28] they that worship Him must worship Him
[1:09:30] in the spirit the Bible says we have to
[1:09:33] worship Him in spirit and in truth and
[1:09:35] that's a false thing in our lives if we
[1:09:37] know there's something there we're
[1:09:39] contrary to the Word of God if we just
[1:09:41] continue to go right on worshiping I
[1:09:43] mean if you know her brother got
[1:09:44] something if you know something you did
[1:09:46] bother somebody if I did something I
[1:09:49] know that bothers that brother it says I
[1:09:51] have to stop what I'm doing right there
[1:09:53] because God doesn't receive the worship
[1:09:55] from that point forward he says stop
[1:09:57] right there and go he doesn't say wait
[1:10:00] for your brother to come and see you why
[1:10:02] you're not in church why you're not
[1:10:03] worried so you stop right there you go
[1:10:05] to that brother and the Bible says be
[1:10:06] reconciled unto that brother you know
[1:10:10] that word reconcile it's a it's a Greek
[1:10:12] word I'm not gonna try to pronounce it
[1:10:14] but I always like to look and see what
[1:10:15] those words mean what's it mean be
[1:10:17] reconciled to thy brother it says the
[1:10:20] word means to change the mind of anyone
[1:10:24] to reconcile to be reconciled to renew I
[1:10:27] like this but to new to renew a
[1:10:30] friendship with one that you like you
[1:10:33] had it before to renew it Oh church amen
[1:10:37] amen you know how little
[1:10:39] like that can ruin a friendship you know
[1:10:42] little things like that could get in a
[1:10:44] church and just cause a big rift amen
[1:10:46] just a little it says you are to go
[1:10:51] first and be reconciled you are to
[1:10:55] change that person's mind you are to
[1:10:57] renew that you are to take that mind
[1:11:00] that he had that ought against you and
[1:11:02] you are to change it when he sees you
[1:11:04] are genuinely want to have that thing
[1:11:06] done away with he says you are to have
[1:11:10] that spirit of reconciliation in you
[1:11:13] they man how many knows we have to have
[1:11:15] it hey there
[1:11:15] that sphere was in crisis is over second
[1:11:18] Corinthians 5:19 God was in Christ
[1:11:21] reconciling the world unto himself while
[1:11:24] bringing us back into fellowship with
[1:11:26] him hey man he says not imputing our
[1:11:30] trespasses unto them but having
[1:11:32] committed unto us the word of
[1:11:34] reconciliation him and he was in the
[1:11:37] world reconciling the world unto himself
[1:11:39] not holding our trespasses against us a
[1:11:42] man he wants us to have the same type of
[1:11:44] Spirit in us tonight in church if we
[1:11:49] have anything less I mean we can tell
[1:11:51] everybody all day long we're bride a man
[1:11:53] but I mean if we're bride we'll have the
[1:11:55] same spirit of the bridegroom with us
[1:11:57] because we become one with him
[1:11:59] how many knows to be the truth but so
[1:12:04] you go to the bread oh well what if he
[1:12:05] won't be reconciled what if he won't
[1:12:08] accept me what if we won't take my
[1:12:11] apology but what do i do then amen you
[1:12:16] make yourself so sincere you make him
[1:12:19] know whether he wants to accept it or
[1:12:21] not you let you be genuinely true in
[1:12:24] your reconciliation they made you say I
[1:12:27] am so sorry what would it take to make
[1:12:30] it right whatever it would take you have
[1:12:32] to humble yourself like Christ did amen
[1:12:36] to bring reconciliation to bring that
[1:12:39] fret to renew that friendship back the
[1:12:41] way it was before whatever it was happen
[1:12:44] he said that spirit has got to be in you
[1:12:47] he said until you do that don't even
[1:12:48] bring your gift to the owner well what
[1:12:51] if he won't accept me brother
[1:12:53] he says you know what you do then he
[1:12:55] says you commit it to God you've done
[1:12:58] your part
[1:12:59] amen now it's up to that brother now
[1:13:01] we're on the other side of the coin of
[1:13:03] forgiveness we'll get to that in a
[1:13:06] minute amen amen
[1:13:08] but you know what a lot of people say
[1:13:10] well just why don't the guy just suck it
[1:13:14] up it wasn't that big a deal you know
[1:13:16] have you ever felt like that
[1:13:18] hey Marion let's speak let's speak real
[1:13:21] here I made it right with God I went to
[1:13:28] God and I said listen lord I you know I
[1:13:30] didn't mean that
[1:13:31] the brother took it the wrong way you
[1:13:34] know I didn't mean it lord please
[1:13:35] forgive me even if I go to him he just
[1:13:37] could still be angry I just don't I just
[1:13:40] don't want to go through all this well
[1:13:42] that sounds real good that sounds real
[1:13:45] good and you might feel good you got it
[1:13:47] all right with God but that didn't
[1:13:49] change that didn't reconcile your
[1:13:50] brother he still feels the exact same
[1:13:52] way he did before you made it right with
[1:13:54] God and not only that but that's not
[1:13:56] what the Word of God said to do the Word
[1:13:58] of God said you stop you go you get
[1:14:02] reconciled then you come back and
[1:14:04] worship a man but a lot of us say oh I
[1:14:05] made it right with God they come right
[1:14:07] on in to church and begin to worship the
[1:14:09] glory hallelujah amen and the problems
[1:14:12] still there I mean and it grieves the
[1:14:16] Spirit of God it says grieve not the
[1:14:18] Holy Spirit whereby you are sealed even
[1:14:20] when you go contrary to what the Spirit
[1:14:22] of God supposed to telling you to do a
[1:14:24] man that's a grieving to that Spirit of
[1:14:26] God that all right
[1:14:28] I'm not evangelist church man

[1:14:49] read it say that's not the way it went

[1:15:22] believe her budget back in my car you
[1:15:25] know he's gonna be a little offended but
[1:15:29] then Jesse looks and I jump out of my
[1:15:31] car and I drop to my knees and I say oh
[1:15:32] god please forgive me for doing that
[1:15:35] please forgive me for being so clumsy oh
[1:15:38] and while you're at it Lord God would
[1:15:40] you please help Jesse to get over this
[1:15:41] and help me when he goes to get it fixed
[1:15:43] and everything will come out all right I

[1:15:51] right I made it okay with God how do you
[1:15:53] supposed brother Jesse feels but that's
[1:15:57] what we do when we try to sidestep dogs
[1:15:59] I will make it all right I mean it
[1:16:01] doesn't change it doesn't renew the
[1:16:03] friendship a man it doesn't it doesn't
[1:16:06] cause reconciliation hey man the Bible
[1:16:09] says that we've got to go to that
[1:16:11] brother until we do we are out of the
[1:16:13] will of God
[1:16:14] I hope brother Jesse gets over it but he
[1:16:19] won't church we need to do what God said
[1:16:23] to do amen and until we do the problem
[1:16:25] doesn't go away Jesse doesn't feel any
[1:16:29] better whoever who Cara backed into him
[1:16:32] and doesn't feel any better I might feel
[1:16:33] better you might feel better you might
[1:16:35] feel like you do but your concreted word
[1:16:36] the Word of God says stop leave your
[1:16:39] gift go get it right then come back and
[1:16:42] worship and everything then you say
[1:16:43] everything okay I stopped I went to

[1:16:55] guy over home that'll fix it man it
[1:16:57] looked like brand-new and I do - he's
[1:16:58] great but anyhow hey man
[1:17:03] Church what is that spirit of
[1:17:05] reconciliation have got to be found if
[1:17:07] we are bribed and that spirit sent us
[1:17:09] we've got to have that same type of
[1:17:10] forgiving spirit that right we've got to
[1:17:15] be willing to go and make it right until
[1:17:18] we do Church were
[1:17:19] only play in church we're only kidding
[1:17:22] ourselves and a lot of problems are in
[1:17:26] churches because a lot of people are
[1:17:28] doing just that thinking it's okay it's
[1:17:31] alright it's not alright
[1:17:32] you said if you have a little funny
[1:17:35] feeling if you have odd any little thing
[1:17:37] he says you stop and you go make it
[1:17:40] right with that brother is that right
[1:17:44] well what about if it's on the other
[1:17:46] side of the coin what about if I'm the
[1:17:53] one that's respondent to having been
[1:17:56] offended what do we do then God didn't
[1:18:01] leave us without instruction just as the
[1:18:03] instructed us on this he instructed us
[1:18:05] on the other we find later on this same
[1:18:07] chapter or the same book of Matthew back
[1:18:11] in the 18th chapter we come and we find
[1:18:13] a man by the name of Peter
[1:18:15] excuse me ma'am by the name of Peter
[1:18:17] comes to Jesus it said Lord how awful
[1:18:22] anselmo often shall my brother sin
[1:18:25] against me and I forgive him how many
[1:18:28] times a man do I have to put up with Jim
[1:18:31] backing into my car dope that guy know
[1:18:35] how to drive and then Peter says til
[1:18:40] seven times and if you look in the the
[1:18:44] book that was quoted on this is the rori
[1:18:46] Study Bible amen
[1:18:49] published by Moody press I mean it talks
[1:18:52] about back in those days why why did why
[1:18:54] did Peter say seven when he picked seven
[1:18:57] times I wonder death yeah
[1:18:59] but if you look at there it said back in
[1:19:00] the days of the Jewish laws and all the
[1:19:03] things he said there was a law of them
[1:19:05] he said the Jews they were a brother
[1:19:06] could offend you once he could offend
[1:19:09] you twice he could offend you three
[1:19:11] times but after that it was gloves off
[1:19:13] it was that was it that was done he had
[1:19:18] three times the charm so you know what
[1:19:19] Peters feeling real benevolent feeling
[1:19:22] real good about himself he said Lord how
[1:19:24] many time do I have to forgive my
[1:19:26] brother when he sends against me
[1:19:28] he says I'll double it and add a little
[1:19:30] four boot
[1:19:31] he says til six times no seven times you
[1:19:36] know what Jesus looks at him he says I
[1:19:38] say unto thee until seven times but
[1:19:42] until seventy times seven if you look
[1:19:47] that up in a little thing when you click
[1:19:50] on it with a with a computer that means
[1:19:52] countless times nots 490 times it means
[1:19:56] countless times he says don't not just
[1:20:00] once but countless times and I'm so glad
[1:20:03] that's the spirit that God had he didn't
[1:20:07] say oh brother Jim I'll forgive you this
[1:20:09] time but don't make that same mistake
[1:20:11] again
[1:20:12] no matter how many times I make a
[1:20:14] mistake no matter how many times I fall
[1:20:16] he's willing to forgive me countless
[1:20:18] times a man he puts my sins in to see a
[1:20:21] God for he just forgives me time after
[1:20:23] time after time amen oh I'm so glad of
[1:20:27] that if it wasn't just all forgive you
[1:20:29] for your two times but I've had it up to
[1:20:31] here no he said he says his mercy
[1:20:34] endureth forever oh thank God I mean if
[1:20:37] that spirit is us we'll have the same
[1:20:39] spirit towards a brother or a sister no
[1:20:41] matter how many times if it broke Jim
[1:20:43] you know how hard that is
[1:20:44] maybe it sure for us it's hard but with
[1:20:46] him all things are possible in there
[1:20:48] it's with the spirit that's in it that
[1:20:50] we can do that amen not by ourselves
[1:20:53] he says countless times therefore
[1:20:56] and then he begins to tell a little
[1:20:59] parable I want to share this with you
[1:21:01] tonight therefore is the Kingdom of
[1:21:03] Heaven likened unto a certain King which
[1:21:05] would take account of his servants now
[1:21:08] we began to reckon one he brought unto
[1:21:10] Him which owed and he began to reckon
[1:21:13] him and you know what that word reckon
[1:21:14] means it means to keep an account of
[1:21:17] what's going on with your servants he
[1:21:19] said the King began to look at the
[1:21:21] account that was you know how many
[1:21:23] singer/song an old account was large and
[1:21:26] growing every day how many ever sing a
[1:21:29] song because I was always sinning and
[1:21:32] never stopped to pay and when I look me
[1:21:36] above and saw such pain and woe I went
[1:21:39] on to the keeper and I sailed it long
[1:21:42] ago I got it reconciled
[1:21:44] they mean well if you haven't sung it's
[1:21:47] a good song hey bit but it there was a
[1:21:50] record in heaven being kept and God says
[1:21:54] you know what I want that record done
[1:21:55] away with I want that record to be put
[1:21:58] in a sea of God's for you I want that
[1:22:00] record never the more I don't want any
[1:22:02] more reckoning to be done him in he said
[1:22:05] when he began to reckon with one who
[1:22:06] brought unto Him which owed him ten
[1:22:08] thousand talents but for as much as he
[1:22:11] could not pay his LORD commanded him to
[1:22:13] be sold and his wife and his children
[1:22:15] all that he had and payment to be made
[1:22:17] and the servant therefore fell down and
[1:22:19] worst was saying Lord have patience me I
[1:22:21] will pay you all and the Lord of a
[1:22:25] servant was moved with compassion and
[1:22:27] loosed him and forgave his dead a
[1:22:30] perfect type of Jesus Christ he was
[1:22:34] telling a parable you know parable is a
[1:22:36] story that that depicts a truth or or or
[1:22:40] something they want to make known and he
[1:22:44] told this story and that's exactly what
[1:22:46] Jesus did for you and me amen i order
[1:22:49] debt I could not pay he paid a debt he
[1:22:52] did not owe him an I needed someone to
[1:22:55] wash the slate clean hey man and he sent
[1:22:58] his life's blood and he washed that
[1:23:00] slate clean for me tonight I stand here
[1:23:02] completely forgiven because of what God
[1:23:04] did for me on television aren't you glad
[1:23:06] for that thank you oh that's a spirit
[1:23:08] that was in my Lord amen he had
[1:23:10] compassion he loved me so much he said
[1:23:13] be kind one to another forgiving one
[1:23:15] another even as God for Christ's sake
[1:23:17] forgave you if that spirits in us
[1:23:20] tonight Church amen
[1:23:21] we'll do it the same way he did he said
[1:23:25] but then what happened he said the
[1:23:27] servant fell down and worshiped him
[1:23:28] saying Lord have patience me and the
[1:23:30] Lord forgave him but that same servant
[1:23:32] went out and found one of his
[1:23:34] fellow-servants that owed him a hundred
[1:23:35] pence I owe two million bucks I went out
[1:23:40] and found somebody there owed me ten
[1:23:42] dollars Church hey man can you imagine
[1:23:46] this the great sin debt that was upon
[1:23:48] each one of us in Christ just Frank
[1:23:51] frankly forgave us all he just forgave
[1:23:54] us all but then he went on he began to
[1:23:57] tell
[1:23:58] are you seeing what the Lord is trying
[1:23:59] to say here she said that same sever
[1:24:01] went out and found one of his
[1:24:02] fellow-servants which owed him a hundred
[1:24:04] pence and he laid hands on him he took
[1:24:07] him by the throat saying pay me what you
[1:24:08] owe me and a fellow servant fell down
[1:24:10] just like I did and said Oh forgive me
[1:24:13] have patience with me I'll pay
[1:24:15] everything that I owe you and he would
[1:24:19] not but he cast him into prison - he
[1:24:21] should pay the dead and when a fellow
[1:24:25] servants saw what was done they were
[1:24:26] very sorry they came and told their Lord
[1:24:28] what all that was done and the Lord
[1:24:30] after the Lord after that he had called
[1:24:32] him said unto Him thou wicked servant we
[1:24:36] come to church and we just act so holy
[1:24:38] we come to church we act just so pious
[1:24:42] amen but yet we can't forgive a brother
[1:24:44] one little offence when God forgave us
[1:24:48] of all that he did we come to church and
[1:24:51] we hold oh you don't know what that
[1:24:52] brother said he wouldn't even shake my
[1:24:54] hand after church maybe he didn't see
[1:24:57] you maybe he was busy I don't know but
[1:25:01] you know how many problems build up over
[1:25:04] one little molehill like that one little
[1:25:06] thing you know that Jesus said that's
[1:25:13] wicked is a wicked spirit that's not the
[1:25:16] Holy Spirit he says that wicked servant
[1:25:20] i forgave thee all that debt because
[1:25:24] simply because you asked me to simply
[1:25:27] because that's what your desire was he
[1:25:30] says should thou not have had compassion
[1:25:32] on thy fellow servant even as I had pity
[1:25:36] on you shouldn't you have done the very
[1:25:38] same thing Church hey shouldn't we have
[1:25:42] the same thing on the brother
[1:25:43] hey man after Christ has forgiven us all
[1:25:46] of our sin all of our debts have been
[1:25:48] all that great account that was grown
[1:25:50] shouldn't we have stunned the same thing
[1:25:52] to our brothers and sisters tonight yes
[1:25:55] absolutely
[1:26:00] the Lord was wrought and he said you
[1:26:04] wicked servant i forgave you all should
[1:26:07] you not have done it had pity on thee as
[1:26:08] I had pity on thee
[1:26:11] the lure was raw and the Bible said they
[1:26:12] delivered him to the tormentors till he
[1:26:16] should pay all that was due him you know
[1:26:21] that word tormenters it's it's it's from
[1:26:23] the same root word we read over in
[1:26:25] Matthew the eighth chapter says when
[1:26:27] Jesus entered the Capernaum he came at
[1:26:29] him a Centurion beseeching the same Lord
[1:26:31] my servant live the home sick of the
[1:26:33] palsy grievously tormented he was sick
[1:26:36] he would die he was in great pain
[1:26:38] physically great pain Jesus said I'll
[1:26:43] come in healing that word torment means
[1:26:47] to vex to be Grievous to have grievious
[1:26:50] pains in the body or the mind to be
[1:26:52] harassed to be distressed the same root
[1:26:55] word loot over in Luke 2:16 chapter he
[1:26:57] said then he'll he lifted up his eyes
[1:26:59] talking about that rich young ruler he
[1:27:00] said he'll he lift up his eyes being in
[1:27:02] torment seeing Abraham afar off and
[1:27:04] Lazarus boozing and he cried and said
[1:27:07] father Abraham have mercy on me said
[1:27:10] Lazarus the tip dip the tip of his
[1:27:12] finger in the water to cool my tongue
[1:27:13] for I am tormented by these flames he
[1:27:17] was in intense pain that word is a Greek
[1:27:20] word Amen I'm not gonna try to pronounce
[1:27:21] it either he said it cause it means to
[1:27:23] cause intense pain to be an anguish to
[1:27:26] be tormented to torment or distress
[1:27:28] oneself amen and Jesus said he turned
[1:27:35] him over to the tormentors because he
[1:27:39] wouldn't forgive his brother he turned
[1:27:42] him over to the tormentors Church I
[1:27:48] wonder how many people sit in church and
[1:27:49] they are tormented they are in great
[1:27:52] pain they're in great anguish amen
[1:27:54] because I mean they look at her brother
[1:27:56] comes to the door they think of that
[1:27:58] little odd that he committed and rather
[1:28:02] than just forgiving saying all right you
[1:28:05] know I know you didn't mean to do it and
[1:28:07] move on like Christ did for our sake
[1:28:10] like the Bible says we are to do forgive
[1:28:12] one another even as God for Christ's
[1:28:14] sake hath forgiven you
[1:28:16] he says they sit when they sit right
[1:28:19] there he says how many married people
[1:28:20] hey men who marriage goes awry amen
[1:28:24] that person just constantly with a
[1:28:25] bitter spirit him and it just begins to
[1:28:27] eat away and I'm gonna eat away at him
[1:28:29] and eat away at him and all of a sudden
[1:28:31] they just find himself constantly in
[1:28:33] misery they can't even worship God he
[1:28:39] says so likewise shall the Heavenly
[1:28:42] Father do also unto you if from your
[1:28:45] heart you forgive not every one his
[1:28:49] brother their trespasses so well this is
[1:28:53] just a this is just a parable brother
[1:28:55] Jim the parable ended in verse 34 he
[1:28:58] said now he says that's exactly what'll
[1:29:02] happen to you that's exactly what
[1:29:04] happened to me we can't come here and
[1:29:06] worship God we can't come here and claim
[1:29:08] to be the bride of Jesus Christ when
[1:29:10] we're in torment we're eating alive with
[1:29:12] it poison acid of jealousy and malice
[1:29:16] brother branham culpa he says you can't
[1:29:19] come and worship what that is
[1:29:21] he says you need to do what Jesus Christ
[1:29:23] did you need to if the Spirit of Christ
[1:29:26] is really in us this evening church if
[1:29:30] that spirit is really in us we will look
[1:29:33] to the brother and do what brother
[1:29:35] Branham said in Christ the mystery here
[1:29:36] we are going back to that same scripture
[1:29:38] that same message we used this morning
[1:29:40] we're talking about Christ being
[1:29:41] revealed in the bride in this hour right
[1:29:45] the Spirit of Christ being revealed in
[1:29:46] the bride in this hour
[1:29:47] he said if her brother you think he's a
[1:29:50] little wrong or a sister say Lord don't
[1:29:53] let never let me have the root of
[1:29:55] bitterness bring up in me
[1:29:57] he says cuz it'll affect him whoa not
[1:30:02] just you it'll affect him it'll take the
[1:30:05] Christ out of my life that poison acid
[1:30:08] of malice and jealousy and hatred it
[1:30:11] will just take the Holy Spirit right
[1:30:13] away from you or to run him away from a
[1:30:14] tabernacle it'll kill the Spirit of God
[1:30:16] or drive it away from here hurt your
[1:30:18] pastor do everything don't do that he
[1:30:20] says that's not the Spirit of Christ he
[1:30:24] says you just waxed that much closer if
[1:30:29] the spirits in you yes you just waxed
[1:30:32] that much closer drop the buckle love
[1:30:34] one another anyhow talk nice about one
[1:30:37] of their say nice
[1:30:37] think about what he says then then God
[1:30:40] will bless you
[1:30:42] you know why the churches sometimes
[1:30:43] aren't being blessed you know why
[1:30:45] there's people sitting there in anguish
[1:30:47] and torment that's because we're still
[1:30:49] not manifesting that spirit of
[1:30:51] forgiveness in our lives the Bible says
[1:30:57] that we are to grieve not the Spirit of
[1:30:59] God whereby we are sealed unto the day
[1:31:02] of redemption doesn't say that spirit
[1:31:04] wasn't there it says we grieve that
[1:31:05] spirit away from us Amen how is it he
[1:31:09] said by having an unforgiving spirit yes
[1:31:12] sir
[1:31:13] Church we can sit here and claim to be
[1:31:15] bride and wonder why we don't get
[1:31:17] something out of the service and wonder
[1:31:18] why things aren't moving and wonder why
[1:31:20] brother Jesse can't break through or
[1:31:21] wonder why we can't seem to get the
[1:31:23] victory amen if we would search our
[1:31:25] hearts tonight each one of us search our
[1:31:29] hearts tonight and say where's that
[1:31:33] spirit of forgiveness in me am i
[1:31:35] manifesting a christ-like spirit amen
[1:31:38] or am I still having a problem am I
[1:31:41] still fighting with this thing if I
[1:31:43] still holding this bitterness they men
[1:31:46] towards a brother or sister when they've
[1:31:47] already asked me to forgive them yes or
[1:31:51] maybe I need to go to someone who who I
[1:31:54] have offended and I sit here and say
[1:31:56] well I've made it all right with God him
[1:31:57] and contrary to the word wonder why we
[1:31:59] can't get the victory Church hey man I
[1:32:02] want you to know one thing if we have a
[1:32:03] problem like that we can call ourselves
[1:32:06] bride all day long but that spirit is
[1:32:10] not being manifested in our lives
[1:32:13] believe it tonight
[1:32:15] I got about
[1:32:20] they're hours worth of stuff but I could
[1:32:21] go to him in I think I'm gonna stop
[1:32:25] right there tonight if that's all right
[1:32:26] brother Jesse maybe just stand your feet
[1:32:29] with me the secret
[1:32:38] when your brother offends you Church
[1:32:40] what do you do when your brother offends
[1:32:43] you do you hold that bitterness in your
[1:32:46] heart or do you say you know Lord God I
[1:32:49] forgive you
[1:32:50] just as God for Christ's sakes forgave
[1:32:53] us man let all bitterness and wrath and
[1:32:57] anger and clamor and evil speaking be
[1:33:00] put away from you with all malice and be
[1:33:02] kind one to another tender-hearted
[1:33:03] forgiving one another even as God for
[1:33:05] Christ's sakes forgive you if we failed
[1:33:07] to do that if we try to do it our way
[1:33:10] and say well I made it right with God or
[1:33:13] or I just you know the brother should
[1:33:15] just get over it and this side the other
[1:33:16] event or if we just can't quite get rid
[1:33:19] of that little funny feeling we have
[1:33:21] towards somebody when they've come and
[1:33:22] ask us amen call and claim to be bride
[1:33:25] of Jesus I'm here to tell you tonight
[1:33:26] Church we can know whether we're bright
[1:33:28] or night if that Spirit of Christ is in
[1:33:31] us and his spirit was the spirit of
[1:33:34] forgiveness would you bow your heads
[1:33:35] with me this evening
[1:33:36] I wonder tonight Amen if we'd be honest
[1:33:39] in our hearts if there's some here that
[1:33:42] know that they need to go make something
[1:33:44] right with somebody and say well Jim
[1:33:46] just give me the strength to go and do
[1:33:49] what the Word of God says to do if there
[1:33:51] was someone that that maybe you've
[1:33:53] offended and you need to go and get that
[1:33:55] person reconciled I mean because God has
[1:33:57] given us that spirit reconciliation amen
[1:33:59] and you haven't done it yet amen
[1:34:02] know that you're contrary to the Word of
[1:34:04] God
[1:34:06] if you're in that position you like say
[1:34:08] Oh Jim just pray for me that I would be
[1:34:10] able to get this thing taken care of and
[1:34:11] the person would receive it in the
[1:34:13] spirit of Christ it just took your hands
[1:34:15] they pray for me budget maybe you're on
[1:34:18] the other side of the coin and amen

[1:34:28] eating away at the eating wait wait you
[1:34:32] know what it'll finally do that acid I

[1:35:01] friendship is renewed and we're restored
[1:35:04] in the fellowship it's like I am this
[1:35:06] crushed because God for Christ's sake
[1:35:09] forgave me
[1:35:11] when I came and I just simply asked Lord
[1:35:16] if there's someone in here with that
[1:35:18] problem tonight or God for those that
[1:35:21] indicated they have needed prayer in
[1:35:23] this area father we ask that you were

[1:36:37] let's just take it one more moment
[1:36:39] adjust our heads for a moment and just
