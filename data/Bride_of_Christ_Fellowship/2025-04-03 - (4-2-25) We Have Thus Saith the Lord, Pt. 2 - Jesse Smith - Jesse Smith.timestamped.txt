[0:04] it's refreshing to go back over this and
[0:06] just uh just really astounding to think
[0:07] about how many times God anointed our
[0:10] Prophet to speak with thus sayeth the
[0:11] Lord reminds us of Jeremiah Isaiah
[0:14] Ezekiel uh so many prophets of God who
[0:17] spoke with the authority of thus saith
[0:19] the Lord hallelujah
[0:33] and I got at least one more uh sermon
[0:36] here on uh the spirit of burning by
[0:38] God's grace of course you know I can't
[0:40] end that Series without preaching on the
[0:42] day of Pentecost burning everybody
[0:44] understand that by God's grace I could I
[0:46] couldn't end the series without that
[0:48] that's the greatest burning we can have
[0:50] on this side how many how many can say
[0:51] Amen to that the greatest burning you
[0:54] can ever have is where the Holy Ghost
[0:55] Burns in your soul Hallelujah everything
[0:58] it's nice that that burns out here here
[1:00] it's nice if it burns in here nice if it
[1:02] burns right here hallelujah but if it
[1:04] burns in your soul you're sealed unto
[1:07] the day of your Redemption praise God
[1:09] and you can never lose that seal
[1:11] Hallelujah so true James 5:10 we have
[1:15] thus sayith the Lord part two praise God
[1:17] this is what separates us we'd say from
[1:19] any denomination or any uh unorganized
[1:22] group or independent church we might say
[1:24] is that we have a prophet who spoke with
[1:26] thus sayith the Lord and it never failed
[1:29] critics have have come around for years
[1:31] for 20 some years let's see I came to
[1:32] the message 2021 so they come around for
[1:34] 24 years trying to tell me that they've
[1:36] yet to show me one hallelujah hallelujah
[1:38] they might not understand it uh but they
[1:40] do not he's never failed with a thus
[1:42] sayith the Lord hallelujah so we're very
[1:44] thankful for that by God's grace gives
[1:46] us a place to stand when the storms of
[1:48] life rage we know that we're standing on
[1:51] thus sayeth the Lord hallelujah because
[1:53] it agrees with the Bible James
[1:56] 5:10 let's read this if we can on three
[1:58] 1 2 3 take take my brethren the prophets
[2:02] who have spoken in the name of the Lord
[2:05] for an example of suffering Affliction
[2:08] and of patience praise God let's also go
[2:11] to Amos 37 and8 Amos 37 and8 I think I
[2:16] said that right praise God
[2:30] Amos 37 and 8 praise
[2:36] God so these are scriptures we should be
[2:39] familiar with as Bible Believers and
[2:42] those that follow brother Ram's Ministry
[2:44] uh the more I go over them the more uh
[2:46] it edifies my soul uh the more I'm
[2:49] strengthened and encouraged uh believing
[2:51] the word of God the present truth as
[2:53] Peter said be always established in the
[2:55] present truth praise God and we can see
[2:58] all down through the Bible there was
[2:59] always a time where there was a prophet
[3:00] who brought the present truth hallelujah
[3:03] now with brother Braham is different no
[3:04] one's going to add or take away from the
[3:05] Bible so everything he says with us say
[3:07] the lord it's going to agree with the
[3:09] Bible Hallelujah because in the days of
[3:12] you know Moses and Joshua and Abraham
[3:15] Isaac Jacob you know there was no
[3:16] written scripture but now we have the
[3:18] written scripture praise God so we
[3:20] understand that let's read seven and
[3:22] eight 1 2 3 surely the Lord God will do
[3:26] nothing but he revealeth his secret unto
[3:29] his servants the prophets the lion hath
[3:33] roared who will not fear the lord God ha
[3:37] spoken who can but prophesy so we see
[3:40] from this text when a prophet prophesies
[3:42] with thus sayith the lord it's liken
[3:44] unto a lion that
[3:46] Roars and brother Ram said many times he
[3:48] was out in the jungles of uh Africa and
[3:51] he said there was noise at the night
[3:52] time they're hunting at night sometimes
[3:54] he said just let the lion roar one time
[3:56] he said everything shut up from from the
[4:00] zebras to the gazel he said even to the
[4:03] little
[4:04] Beatles everybody recognized the voice
[4:07] of the lion Hallelujah and of course we
[4:09] know it's Jesus Christ speaking through
[4:10] a prophet and the church said amen may
[4:13] God add his Blessing to the reading of
[4:15] his word you can be seated I have some
[4:16] uh quotes here Casa by God's
[4:22] grace you know as we uh mentioned last
[4:24] time we're not following cunningly
[4:26] devised fables as Paul said Hallelujah
[4:29] and uh as brother Ram's own testimony
[4:31] says when God let him go beyond the
[4:33] curtain of time and he went uh into the
[4:35] paradise of God by a vision uh he said
[4:38] there was millions of people that were
[4:40] as converts and uh he said uh The Voice
[4:43] the the angel of the Lord told him
[4:45] you're going to have to be judged by
[4:46] what you preached and uh brother Bram
[4:49] said well is Paul going to be judged by
[4:51] what he preached yes and brother Bram
[4:53] said well then I preach exactly what
[4:55] Paul preached word by word and he said
[4:58] the millions and screamed out we are
[5:00] resting on that Hallelujah so you see
[5:03] you see the pattern every time God sends
[5:05] a man of God the people will have to
[5:07] receive it what the prophet said
[5:09] Hallelujah and then they're judged by
[5:11] the word that was preached for that
[5:13] generation Hallelujah and that's what we
[5:15] saw remember Paul said I'll present the
[5:17] Corinthians I'll present them as a Chase
[5:19] version to Christ and if he was the
[5:21] first church age messenger brother BR is
[5:23] the seventh Church age messenger each
[5:25] Church age messenger the seven angels
[5:27] will present their group under Christ as
[5:30] a Chase virgin Hallelujah so we can see
[5:32] it plainly in the scripture uh by the
[5:34] grace of God the Bible always said the
[5:36] prophets were gathered with their people
[5:37] hallelujah and then so we see uh Paul's
[5:40] people will be gathered with him brother
[5:42] Rams will be gathered with him
[5:43] Hallelujah so we know will be gathered
[5:45] with brother brandom there in heaven by
[5:47] God's grace Hallelujah now remember
[5:48] brother Bram said I'm just rehearsing
[5:50] this as a review uh we have thus sayith
[5:52] the Lord on God dealing with this church
[5:54] you know brother man was again talking
[5:55] about so much education is emphasized he
[5:58] said but God God never dealt with Israel
[6:01] till she come to her Homeland hear me
[6:03] thus sayith the Lord God will not deal
[6:04] with his church till she comes back to
[6:06] the Homeland the message of the Hour
[6:09] come back to the original praise God
[6:12] hallelujah and so we can see some of
[6:14] these names in here that he names you
[6:16] know and we can see uh even just this
[6:18] week there was more news about one of
[6:20] the denominations my wife sent me a link
[6:21] about they went even further away and
[6:24] every year in the summertime there's a
[6:25] Southern Baptist convention every year
[6:27] they fall further and further away from
[6:28] the truth every every summer it's it's
[6:31] just like clockwork and so denominations
[6:34] are like that because they limit God
[6:35] they say they write up their Creed if
[6:37] this was their Creed you know they would
[6:38] say well we'll take this really they're
[6:41] saying we'll take this above this as
[6:42] what they're saying for like uh Baptist
[6:45] you know they'll deny tongues or they'll
[6:46] deny Miracles or something or they
[6:48] they'll say now women can preach so
[6:49] they're really taking this they're
[6:51] exalting this Creed above the word of
[6:53] God but not a true Christian a true
[6:54] Christian places this above everything
[6:56] else Hallelujah and that's what God did
[6:59] uh by G sending us brother brandham to
[7:01] restore all things the Bible says as
[7:03] we'll look at here in just a
[7:05] moment now I don't know if I've gone
[7:07] over this lately but I have this in my
[7:08] book from
[7:09] 2021 um there's at least I think six six
[7:12] scriptures that brother Brandon's
[7:13] Ministry fulfilled and it's acts
[7:17] 32021 uh Matthew 1711 and 12 Malachi 45
[7:22] and 6 Revelation 10 7-1 Amos 37 and Luke
[7:26] 17:30 now if you put all these together
[7:29] it was just revealed to me as I was
[7:30] studying one time this is what I wrote
[7:32] based upon the inspiration from these
[7:34] scriptures so nobody told me this this
[7:36] is just what the Lord revealed to me as
[7:38] I was studying very simple all these
[7:41] verses say Jesus will remain in heaven
[7:43] and not physically return to the Earth
[7:46] until all things including Bible
[7:48] doctrines and the hearts of Believers
[7:50] are restored to their original Apostolic
[7:53] conditions by the preaching of a prophet
[7:55] Anointed with the spirit of
[7:58] Elijah Hallelujah
[8:00] amen nobody shared that with me I mean I
[8:03] you can hear you can see those different
[8:04] parts in these scriptures but that's
[8:06] what was revealed to me praise God now
[8:08] acts 3:21 says um Jesus will remain in
[8:11] Heaven until the times of restitution or
[8:13] restoration of all things so that's
[8:15] where we get that part Matthew 17:11
[8:18] Jesus said Elias shall surely come and
[8:20] restore all things right and that's not
[8:22] referring to Elijah that goes to the
[8:24] Jews they're not going to restore uh the
[8:26] the the law of Moses they're trying to
[8:28] bring they're trying to get the 144,000
[8:30] to accept Jesus Hallelujah so it has to
[8:34] be a a a prophit to the Gentiles
[8:37] Hallelujah and then of course Malachi 45
[8:39] and 6 we need the spirit of Elijah to
[8:41] turn the hearts back to the fathers so
[8:43] it's the it's the uh the children the
[8:45] Believers at the end time getting their
[8:47] hearts turned back to the apostolic
[8:49] faith of the Bible authors like Paul
[8:52] James Peter John so
[8:54] forth Revelation 10 1-7 brother Ram is
[8:57] that seventh angel in Revelation 10:7 he
[8:59] finishes the mystery of God as God had
[9:02] declared to his servants the prophets
[9:04] Hallelujah and then uh we saw this uh
[9:07] God will do nothing except he restore he
[9:09] he he reveals Secrets uh by the prophet
[9:13] and brother Ram did that God showed
[9:14] brother Ram the the secrets behind 12
[9:16] New Testament Mysteries that was my
[9:17] that's what my book was about six of
[9:19] them have thus sayith the Lord Brother R
[9:21] revealed the Seven Seals and there's
[9:23] over 38 differences between his
[9:25] Revelation and Clarence Larin and UAH
[9:28] Smith and all these other uh Charles T
[9:30] Russell all these other preachers of
[9:31] their day and then Luke 17:30 is uh the
[9:35] son of man Ministry in the days of the
[9:37] son of man uh so brother Ram was a son
[9:39] of man he was a prophet he wasn't the
[9:41] son of man Jesus is the son of man
[9:45] brother Ram was a son of man Hallelujah
[9:47] but the son of man had to be revealed at
[9:49] the end time according to Luke
[9:51] 17:30 and so that's what happened uh God
[9:54] sent brother R's Ministry to restore the
[9:56] apostolic faith at the end time
[9:58] Hallelujah so this is what I'm believing
[10:00] with all my heart because of what uh God
[10:03] Vindicated in brother bram's Ministry
[10:04] with thus sayith the Lord hallelujah and
[10:06] I just thought if he was right on all
[10:08] these thus the Lords we have on Doctrine
[10:10] then he's right on everything else
[10:12] because God doesn't mess God doesn't mix
[10:14] up sometimes Hallelujah God sends him
[10:16] with thus sayith the Lord and he's right
[10:18] every time now these are the ones we
[10:20] reviewed I just Ed emojis there to show
[10:22] the check marks that we've uh that we
[10:24] got through last time by God's grace and
[10:27] that's what I was saying if he was right
[10:28] on all these like just a simple thing
[10:30] like marriage and divorce and hair
[10:31] length if he was right on that well then
[10:33] he's got to be right on the others
[10:35] praise God but because again God doesn't
[10:37] miss Hallelujah God doesn't miss and of
[10:40] course brother Rah lived a Godly life
[10:43] nobody can put a finger on his life
[10:45] Hallelujah he lived a Godly life you
[10:47] know you got you got the author of how
[10:49] many you heard of God's generals before
[10:50] you got the author of God's generals he
[10:52] wrote that that gentleman and I think
[10:54] might have had some help he wrote all
[10:56] those articles about preachers down
[10:57] through the years and you know his uh
[11:00] conclusion about brother random is that
[11:01] he had one of the greatest gifts ever
[11:03] but then he got off on his Doctrine at
[11:05] the end what a
[11:08] mistake he never really honestly looked
[11:11] at the scripture praise God especially
[11:13] regarding serpent seed he never looked
[11:14] at that that's one of the ones he said
[11:16] he got off on oh so so so you're telling
[11:18] me now that that an apple caused all
[11:20] this trouble that we have here an apple
[11:22] caused it no it was adultery that caused
[11:25] it and that's still what's causing the
[11:27] trouble Hallelujah is all adultery
[11:30] sexual immorality and everything around
[11:31] the
[11:32] world oh my and today we or tonight Lord
[11:36] willing we'll look at just a few more of
[11:37] these and we'll see how far we can get
[11:39] brother R gave us thus sayith the Lord
[11:41] on the baptism of the Holy Ghost now
[11:42] most churches believe when someone comes
[11:44] up for prayer and they say I want to be
[11:46] a Christian let's pray and for example
[11:48] they might pray a sinner's prayer or you
[11:50] hear preachers they'll say they'll say a
[11:52] quick uh 30 second prayer at the end of
[11:54] a service and they'll say if you said
[11:55] that like Joel if you said that you're
[11:57] born again in the kingdom of God that's
[11:59] a
[12:00] lie that's a lie they're say they're
[12:02] saying one simple prayer no emotion just
[12:04] repeating repeat after me repeat after
[12:06] me and they say they're baptized with
[12:07] the Holy Ghost that's a lie that's a
[12:09] false
[12:10] Doctrine any true church will teach
[12:13] there's three works of Grace you got to
[12:14] get saved Sanctified and then filled
[12:17] with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah any
[12:19] honest person any real honest believer
[12:22] will admit that Hallelujah and so uh I
[12:25] just want the young I don't know if our
[12:26] young brothers and our young children
[12:27] knew that most churches if you go to
[12:29] them they'll say as soon as you're saved
[12:31] or baptized you're filled with the Holy
[12:33] Ghost that's a
[12:35] deception that's a false promise they're
[12:37] giving them a promise that isn't true
[12:40] that's lying to the people so we don't
[12:42] want to get caught up in that and of
[12:44] course it kind of ties in with classical
[12:46] preaching as we'll see brother that's
[12:47] what brother ram calls it classical
[12:49] preaching where they don't try to get
[12:50] you to receive the baptism of the Holy
[12:52] Ghost he said that's of the devil thus
[12:54] sayith the lord it's true so uh here
[12:58] here's where brother says it uh brother
[12:59] B uh wrote a a book for five years he
[13:02] started in 1960 and released it right
[13:04] before his death uh in December 1965 but
[13:08] he he takes a subject of the baptism of
[13:10] the Holy Ghost and I love what he says
[13:11] here it it must be according to the word
[13:14] not according to me and not according to
[13:16] you or me but it has to be thus sayith
[13:19] the Lord or we're falsely LED I love how
[13:22] brother Ram was so humble he said it's
[13:24] not from me any thus sayi the Lord can't
[13:26] be from me it's got to be from the word
[13:28] of God
[13:30] and we're not going to go through all
[13:31] these CU a lot of this is reviewed but
[13:32] in Acts 19 2 and6 the Ephesians get the
[13:35] Holy Ghost but they were already saved
[13:37] under
[13:38] Apollo they're already saved but
[13:41] remember uh aquill and Priscilla got to
[13:43] come by and instruct him in the way of
[13:45] God more perfectly see there was more
[13:47] truth available so I love it if you're
[13:50] hungry for truth God will send you the
[13:52] extra truth you need Hallelujah that's
[13:54] right see they had to live in the
[13:56] present truth when Paul brought it and
[13:59] then the Bible said then they got the
[14:00] Holy Ghost Hallelujah now Paul says in
[14:03] Ephesians 1:13 you're given the Seal of
[14:05] the Holy Ghost after you believe so see
[14:08] you got to believe first you got to get
[14:09] saved and you got to get your life
[14:11] cleaned out Sanctified and then you get
[14:12] the baptism of the Holy Ghost Ezekiel
[14:15] beautifully taught it in Ezekiel 36 he
[14:17] said a new heart new spirit my spirit
[14:21] Jesus said I'm the way the truth and the
[14:23] life Hallelujah Jesus said the wheat has
[14:26] three stages and I always forget these
[14:28] uh you got uh the Sprout you got the uh
[14:31] stem and then you got the seed uh and I
[14:33] always mix them up that's not the exact
[14:35] King James words but Jesus said there's
[14:37] three stages to the kingdom of God
[14:39] hallelujah oh it's all over the Bible
[14:41] Hallelujah I've got a chapter on it and
[14:43] acts 238 said the promises unto you now
[14:46] all these people were already Believers
[14:48] right they already followed Jesus these
[14:49] preachers have followed Jesus three and
[14:50] a half years but he said we are given
[14:52] the promise of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah
[14:55] get baptized and you shall receive the
[14:57] gift of the Holy Ghost Peter walked on
[14:59] water I mean what more could there be
[15:01] there could be a lot more because he
[15:03] sunk in that water amen but when you get
[15:05] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're
[15:07] sealed you're marked you're branded to
[15:09] the day of your Redemption praise
[15:11] God acts 8 of course is down in Samaria
[15:15] the Bible said they they received uh
[15:17] Philip's preaching but then they uh but
[15:19] they prayed and then they sent Peter and
[15:21] John down to lay hands on them to
[15:23] receive the Holy Ghost because the Holy
[15:24] Ghost wasn't yet
[15:26] given and I love this brother Ram shows
[15:28] thus say the lord it's more than just
[15:31] saying a prayer sinner's prayer getting
[15:33] baptized you must go on to be born again
[15:36] hallelujah it's thus sayith the Lord
[15:39] Galatians 3 uh 13 and 14 say we are
[15:42] given the promise of the spirit through
[15:44] Abraham through Abraham's seed
[15:46] Hallelujah and then John 37 Jesus cried
[15:49] out at that last uh uh that last Feast
[15:52] that he was at he said let him that's
[15:54] thirsty come upon me come to me and I'll
[15:56] give you drink and out of your belly
[15:58] flow rivers of living water and the
[16:00] Bible said he spake of the spirit that
[16:02] they should receive after his body was
[16:05] glorified so he was prophesying of the
[16:07] day of Pentecost and the entire Gentile
[16:10] Church ages and brother R said Galatians
[16:13] 4 4-7 is the triumphal Capstone on the
[16:18] Capstone so here's the Capstone love
[16:20] which is God God is love and God when
[16:23] you were born again you're born again
[16:24] God's spirit draws in you it's the love
[16:25] of God that's the Capstone on your being
[16:28] on your soul so let's read that
[16:30] Galatians 4: 4-7 this is the
[16:33] Capstone and it kind of goes with a
[16:35] video I just put out today someone asked
[16:37] me about Matthew
[16:38] 24:24 uh why can the elect not be
[16:42] deceived and the answer is twofold
[16:44] because you're predestinated and because
[16:46] then during your lifetime you receive
[16:47] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's why
[16:49] you cannot be deceived that's why no
[16:51] preacher can deceive me or no woman can
[16:53] deceive me or you or anything like that
[16:55] nobody will deceive us because we've got
[16:57] the spirit of Truth we can't be deceived
[17:00] because we know the truth and the truth
[17:01] has made us free Hallelujah and church
[17:04] we would feel the chains of bondage come
[17:06] back on us if we were being deceived
[17:09] Hallelujah you'd feel those dark Spirits
[17:12] you'd feel the love of God leave you
[17:13] would feel the Holy Ghost grieved
[17:16] Hallelujah that's right Church Galatians
[17:18] 4
[17:20] 4-7 but when the fullness of time was
[17:22] come God sent forth a son made of a
[17:24] woman made under the law to redeem that
[17:25] were under the law that we might receive
[17:27] the adoption of sons remember
[17:29] uh Paul said in Romans the holy spirit
[17:31] is the spirit of adoption that goes into
[17:33] your hearts crying ABA
[17:37] father so that's what the baptism of the
[17:39] Holy Ghost is you're adopted into the
[17:41] family of
[17:42] God verse six and verse six is the the
[17:45] main verse the main phrase and because
[17:48] you are Sons let's all say because ready
[17:50] because why do you get the Holy Ghost
[17:52] because you already were a son or
[17:54] daughter of God in the mind of God
[17:57] that's why that's why Jud Judas couldn't
[17:59] get the Holy Ghost in the soul because
[18:01] he he was the son of predition not the
[18:03] son of almighty God or a son of almighty
[18:06] God it only goes to Sons and Daughters
[18:08] aren't you glad if you received it
[18:10] aren't you glad you're a son and
[18:11] daughter of God hallelujah that's why I
[18:13] got it because I am a Son of God
[18:15] hallelujah and brother gives the example
[18:18] uh you know if I were to
[18:20] uh you know if I were in the Old
[18:22] Testament uh you know and and I was
[18:24] going to adopt my son Malachi well then
[18:26] I'd give I'd hand over the Reigns to my
[18:28] my classroom and he would take over my
[18:30] classroom and I would adopt him and I
[18:32] say well now you're in charge I'd hand
[18:33] over my bank account to him and he'd be
[18:35] the inheritor my oldest son you
[18:38] know and so uh that's the same thing
[18:40] here with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[18:42] God gives over the authority to you of
[18:44] the word of God and now you can speak
[18:47] the word hallelujah and now you have
[18:50] power over evil spirits come on Church
[18:52] you mothers know you can lay hands on
[18:54] your children and they'll recover it
[18:56] just don't have to be a preacher
[18:57] Hallelujah
[18:59] it's the power and authority that's just
[19:00] one small gift Divine Healing is just
[19:02] one small gift what about the wisdom
[19:03] that can flow out of your lips or the
[19:05] knowledge or the word of faith
[19:07] hallelujah or prophecy or dream or
[19:09] Vision or something like that all that
[19:11] can flow out of a person who's an
[19:12] adopted son or daughter of
[19:14] God that's right
[19:17] hallelujah amen see because you are Sons
[19:21] God has sent forth the spirit of his son
[19:23] into your hearts crying ABA father and
[19:25] brother Adam says that awesome he said
[19:27] he said who received the Holy H ghost on
[19:29] the day of Pentecost brother man said
[19:30] Sons
[19:32] daughters amen who received the Holy
[19:34] Ghost at Ephesus Sons and Daughters 12
[19:37] of them Hallelujah who received the Holy
[19:39] Ghost in akan son and daughters
[19:41] hallelujah or maybe it was Napoleon for
[19:43] you or maybe it was Lima for me
[19:45] Hallelujah who received it Sons and
[19:47] Daughters received it Hallelujah that's
[19:50] who always received that's the only
[19:52] people that will receive it praise
[19:54] God and then in John chapter 6 it says
[19:57] how do you know you're a son or daughter
[19:58] because Jesus said you can be taught the
[20:00] word of God only the children of God can
[20:04] be taught the word of God that's why
[20:05] they'll reject serpent SE like God's
[20:06] generals that's why they'll reject
[20:08] Holiness like most Pentecostals now
[20:10] reject Holiness right they let the women
[20:11] wear split skirts and high heels and
[20:13] makeup and cut their hair they reject it
[20:15] because they it shows they can't be
[20:17] taught the word of God that doesn't mean
[20:18] they're not saved it just shows if
[20:20] they're saved they're foolish they're
[20:21] not wise to all the word because the
[20:24] Pentecostal church has changed but God's
[20:26] word has never changed Hallelujah may
[20:28] God help us not to change
[20:32] Hallelujah that's the Temptation if you
[20:34] live a long life Satan will just try to
[20:36] wear you out over the years and decades
[20:38] to get you to compromise a little bit
[20:41] and so that's what I'm going to have to
[20:42] withstand Hallelujah as a young man of
[20:45] 44
[20:46] Hallelujah notice I said young
[20:49] man verse seven wherefore Thou Art no
[20:52] more a servant but a son and if a son
[20:54] then an heir of God through Christ
[20:57] Hallelujah Church you have have an
[20:58] eternal inheritance because you're a son
[21:00] or daughter of God hallelujah you've got
[21:03] a mansion we know in the future home but
[21:05] also that Mansion is a new glorified
[21:07] body that will never sin
[21:10] Hallelujah brother R uses it both
[21:12] Mansion for your your uh glorified body
[21:14] or theophany that you go to live in
[21:16] because the Bible said it's a house not
[21:17] made with hands in the heavens but we
[21:19] also know we'll build houses in the
[21:22] Millennium and then we know there's
[21:24] mansions in the future home praise God
[21:27] because it's a city 1,000 500 miles wide
[21:30] and 1,500 miles high praise God a
[21:33] pyramid city so we have thus say the
[21:36] Lord we can prove it I think I have five
[21:39] examples in the New
[21:41] Testament of groups that were already
[21:43] saved already Believers but not yet born
[21:46] again so who we going to believe Joel
[21:48] oene or the chapel or a Baptist Church
[21:50] or we going to believe the Bible we're
[21:53] going to be the Bible and thus sayeth
[21:55] the Lord from a prophet of God you know
[21:59] one time I had a good Baptist or good
[22:01] yeah a good Baptist friend from the
[22:01] chapel he's a good man he was a school
[22:03] teacher and I was painting with him one
[22:04] summer and I brought up Acts 19 and he
[22:08] said oh yeah I I've read that before he
[22:10] said but that doesn't apply to us I said
[22:12] it's in the Bible buddy as I'm trying
[22:15] toay I'm sorry it's in the Bible how can
[22:17] you say it doesn't apply to them but
[22:19] then acts 238 applies
[22:21] somehow see it's just you know they try
[22:23] to shift away and just say oh this
[22:25] doesn't apply to me the whole thing
[22:27] applies to me if you look look at the
[22:28] New Testament praise God the whole thing
[22:31] applies see they just want to pick and
[22:32] choose it's not a buffet you got to eat
[22:34] all the word of God
[22:35] [Music]
[22:37] hallelujah live by the entire book eat
[22:39] the whole book God told Ezekiel and John
[22:43] eat the book Hallelujah but see they
[22:45] want to spit out these wonderful seed
[22:47] words that that's okay I like to eat
[22:49] those seeds
[22:50] Hallelujah Glory so now this ties along
[22:54] with it the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[22:55] brother said what we need is an old
[22:57] stirring of the Holy Spirit again and
[22:58] the church said brother it had to come
[23:01] to me before God ever manifested himself
[23:03] we need another Russian Mighty Wind
[23:05] scent as it did on the day of Pentecost
[23:07] they were all religious and followers of
[23:09] Jesus but they had to go and receive the
[23:11] baptism of the spirit is that true and
[23:13] listen here women you got to be salty
[23:14] and listen to this do you realize that
[23:16] up in there they when they all went up
[23:18] 120 to pray they never done like the
[23:20] Baptist shake hands and put their name
[23:22] on the book and saides I'm born again
[23:25] they didn't have it like that there's no
[23:26] such a scripture as that in the Bible
[23:28] and we Catholic people who come lick out
[23:30] our tongue and take the Holy Eucharist
[23:32] and say we got the Holy Ghost no such
[23:34] scripture in the
[23:36] Bible we methodists go on prohibition
[23:39] for six months or now they're they're uh
[23:42] they're going on lent and now they they
[23:43] give up chocolate for a few weeks or uh
[23:46] they give up TV or or Facebook and like
[23:49] it's some big sacrifice the real
[23:51] sacrifice is dying out to yourself and
[23:54] getting rid out of all sin in your life
[23:56] not for a few months but for the rest of
[23:58] your days hallelujah let's do a lifetime
[24:01] lent not just a few weeks of
[24:03] Lent hallelujah it's hypocritical praise
[24:06] God and you go right back to it they say
[24:09] oh I can't wait till I can go back to EA
[24:10] all that chocolate and ice cream and
[24:12] then they wonder why they're overweight
[24:13] inflamed and unhealthy Hallelujah and
[24:16] getting cancer and all kinds of diabetes
[24:18] and everything like that it shows you're
[24:20] wrong in the first place you ought to
[24:21] quit those dirty habits that you got
[24:24] that's right I remember what it was like
[24:26] I was going to share that with brother
[24:28] Chris you all saw my you all see my
[24:29] picture last summer when I showed all
[24:31] those red spots oh yes it's a dirty
[24:33] habit it's addiction it's lust of the
[24:36] flesh but we overcome it by the holy
[24:38] spirit it's a beautiful thing called
[24:40] Temperance
[24:41] Hallelujah Glory there's no such a thing
[24:44] in the scripture as a lent or
[24:46] prohibition but the Bible said when the
[24:48] day of Pentecost was fully come there
[24:49] came a sound from heaven like a rushing
[24:51] Mighty Wind and it filled all the house
[24:53] where they were sitting we've had two
[24:54] people tell me uh three the wind of the
[24:57] Holy Spirit came in into this Sanctuary
[24:59] right
[25:00] here
[25:02] hallelujah Glory Emma amen and haua both
[25:06] all three said that that the wind of the
[25:08] Holy Spirit just come blowing through
[25:10] hallelujah oh my glory to God all things
[25:13] are possible to them that believe
[25:15] Hallelujah a heart's got to be prepared
[25:18] a heart's got to be ready a heart's got
[25:20] to want to be born again amen hallelujah
[25:23] just like on the day of Pentecost they
[25:24] were ready they were prayed up they
[25:26] didn't care how they acted they just
[25:28] wanted to know they had God's promise
[25:30] Hallelujah that's what we need people
[25:32] today that they don't they don't care
[25:34] how they act they don't care what people
[25:35] will think of them they just want to
[25:37] declare the wonderful works of God they
[25:39] just want to get in the spirit of God
[25:41] hallelujah amen glory was so hard to
[25:45] find people that really want to get in
[25:47] the spirit of God and let go and let God
[25:51] hallelujah they want to act all
[25:53] classical and all under the control all
[25:55] the time well I can't even do that as a
[25:57] preacher can hardly do that Hallelujah
[26:00] and if I'm under the anointing how about
[26:01] you we all got to get under the
[26:03] anointing praise
[26:05] God if I can raise my voice like this
[26:07] and preach and try to get inspiration
[26:09] for an hour at a time and you can't do
[26:11] it for five minutes something's wrong
[26:14] hallelujah it's just yielding to your
[26:16] gift praise God or yielding to God's
[26:18] Gift Hallelujah that's right and the
[26:22] power of God so enclosed those people
[26:24] and anointed them till they run out into
[26:26] the streets screaming and dancing and
[26:28] hollering and acting like a bunch of
[26:30] drunk people that's the scripture thus
[26:32] sayeth the
[26:34] Lord oh don't you love it amen and let
[26:37] me speak this just a minute brother says
[26:38] in 1956 Chicago Illinois boy Chicago
[26:42] could use a
[26:43] Revival but they probably missed it did
[26:45] you know where this class come from
[26:47] class is of the devil so he's talking
[26:49] about just unemotional worship going to
[26:52] church now that's thus sayith the lord
[26:55] of the Bible class and PP came from the
[26:57] Devil in the very beginning when Cain
[26:59] and Abel come up to worship Cain come
[27:01] before the Lord in class Abel came in
[27:03] righteousness by
[27:05] Revelation so Cain just offered uh
[27:08] fruits and he worked a lot harder than
[27:11] Abel right as far as all the weeding and
[27:13] everything he just brought fruit but
[27:16] Abel Abel brought life because the life
[27:18] is in the blood he brought a life a dead
[27:22] life and and that's a type of what we
[27:24] need praise God we need the spiritual
[27:26] life or the baptism of the Holy G ghost
[27:28] and it's through an emotional experience
[27:30] that others can see and hear Brother
[27:33] Patrick why don't you read that acts 233
[27:35] and uh Claude why don't you read acts 15
[27:38] or 11:15 you got your Bibles there
[27:39] Brothers if you got your Bible let's go
[27:41] there acts
[27:44] 233 see there has to be when you get the
[27:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost it's not just
[27:48] some classical thing like some under
[27:51] contr control kind of thing is you
[27:52] actually lose control Hallelujah and God
[27:56] just like when a baby's born a baby
[27:58] screams and cries and and you try to
[28:00] Hudd hug it up and cuddle it by God's
[28:03] grace it's a noisy thing you can see a
[28:06] baby born you can hear a baby born
[28:09] that's in the natural but it's also in
[28:11] the spiritual praise God so brother
[28:13] Patrick can you read acts 233 brother
[28:42] amen the church said God shed this forth
[28:45] It's almost like he gets the shedding
[28:47] the uh the illustration of pouring out
[28:50] his heart upon the people pouring out
[28:52] his love he shed this forth and
[28:53] everybody could see the shedding of
[28:55] God's love and hear it by God's grace
[28:58] Hallelujah that's right you'll see it
[29:01] and hear it and then brother uh uh
[29:04] brother
[29:11] Claude at the beginning so it fell the
[29:14] same way in Samaria it fell the same way
[29:17] at cornelius's house as it did at the
[29:19] beginning that's because Jesus Christ is
[29:21] the
[29:22] same it's always going to fall the same
[29:25] when the Holy Ghost comes on you you
[29:26] you'll say something you'll move they
[29:28] they they can see something happen to
[29:30] you remember in uh Albuquerque New
[29:32] Mexico brother Adam saw the pillar of
[29:34] fire uh anoint a woman and first when
[29:37] the Holy Ghost anointed her she threw up
[29:38] her hands and then she screamed at the
[29:40] top of her voice and brother said There
[29:42] It Is receive it while it's here he said
[29:44] open yourself up you can be born again
[29:47] Hallelujah am Glory that's simple just
[29:51] lifting your hands you could see it and
[29:53] you can hear it she screamed and praise
[29:56] the Lord she gave God glory but it's
[29:58] thus sayith the Lord just to walk up and
[30:00] say give me my uh give me my wafer give
[30:02] me my uh drink or I want to sign a
[30:05] pledge I I'll come to church every
[30:06] Sunday I promise I'll pledge that for
[30:08] six months until football season starts
[30:12] you know the sign of these pledges
[30:13] that's not the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[30:15] that's of the devil but when you get the
[30:18] Holy Ghost brother said you can't wait
[30:19] for those doors to open because your
[30:21] soul only feeds on one thing the word of
[30:24] God hallelujah and he says you can't
[30:26] wait to Fellowship with all your your
[30:29] brothers and sisters in the body of
[30:31] Jesus
[30:32] Christ glory to
[30:34] God I love it now look when Cain came he
[30:38] brought the fruits of the field
[30:39] everything that grows the flowers and
[30:41] everything and decorated his altar he
[30:43] worshiped God a true picture of the
[30:44] carnal church member today most churches
[30:47] are going to have flowers all over their
[30:48] altars Church there's nothing wrong with
[30:50] that but brother mam said you're the one
[30:53] that needs to be on the
[30:54] altar Glory praise God we're the ones
[30:57] that need to be seeking God
[30:59] [Music]
[31:01] hallelujah we're the ones that got to be
[31:03] serious down down to business with
[31:05] God the carnal-minded pastor who wants a
[31:09] church that sits higher than the rest of
[31:11] them in the city well you know that's
[31:13] not me I don't never compare our church
[31:15] to well I can't wait till we're bigger
[31:16] than the chapel I can't wait till we're
[31:18] bigger than faith family brother
[31:23] Malachi the faith is bigger the word of
[31:26] the portion of the word is greater
[31:29] that's
[31:29] right and he says all them all those
[31:32] plush seats and a million dooll pipe
[31:36] organ uh this was a free hand-me-down
[31:38] right here so not exactly a million
[31:41] dollars and this was a couple hundred
[31:43] dollars maybe uh that was all those H 12
[31:46] 13 years
[31:47] ago good good investment not exactly a
[31:50] million probably two or three hundred
[31:52] good job good
[31:53] job see but if if the pastor don't have
[31:56] those things they think they're less
[31:59] Hallelujah but we're not less we're Sons
[32:00] and Daughters praise God and I've gone
[32:03] to some of those services and I feel
[32:04] like a ice cube brother Bram said they
[32:07] need an usher to walk through and break
[32:09] the ice cubes off the top of their doors
[32:11] he said what they need is a Holy Ghost
[32:13] Fire Hallelujah the fire of God the wind
[32:16] of God to blow through the church set
[32:18] the church on fire get them loving Jesus
[32:21] worshiping Jesus praying more serving
[32:23] God using their gifts we need the fire
[32:25] of the Holy Ghost that's what we need
[32:27] the spirit of burd
[32:29] hallelujah amen not class not million
[32:31] dollars not plush seats not a piano
[32:33] organ we need ourselves to be the organ
[32:36] to sing unto God Almighty
[32:38] Hallelujah God don't want to put up a
[32:40] choir here God wants you to be the
[32:42] choir God Wants You on the altar praise
[32:45] God
[32:49] glory god don't care for that he said
[32:53] that don't have a thing you that's a lot
[32:55] of those great big places that that done
[32:57] your people until they just about pour
[32:59] poppers and everything else with all
[33:01] your stuff to put in the church and
[33:02] thousands of heathens dying on the
[33:03] mission field without knowing Christ one
[33:06] time right it's a disgrace to
[33:08] Christianity so by my brother and I say
[33:10] they can put millions of dollars in a
[33:11] church but how many how how could how
[33:13] much better would that money have been
[33:14] spent helping other people
[33:18] overseas my goodness oh if you could
[33:21] only see one time you'd know what I was
[33:23] speaking of build that million-dollar
[33:25] Church two-thirds of the world never
[33:26] heard of Jesus what a pit brother Ram
[33:28] says here some more thus sayith the
[33:31] Lords where's my CL oh I'm only half an
[33:33] hour in praise
[33:34] God now this first one is kind of the
[33:37] same it's on this along the same lines
[33:39] of classical
[33:40] preaching but remember Church most
[33:42] churches are all classical today very
[33:45] few now there's some Pentecostals that
[33:46] are still pretty good they get in the
[33:47] spirit but very few and I'm saying we've
[33:49] got to get in the spirit of God more
[33:51] praise God I like it when we repent in
[33:53] the prayer line or that's really good
[33:55] too but also we should be in the spirit
[33:57] to work worship God hallelujah or to
[34:00] give a word to somebody or or go pray
[34:02] for somebody or pray for them to be
[34:03] healed or or tell them a dream you had
[34:05] or something be led by the Holy Spirit
[34:07] give God some Glory
[34:09] Hallelujah how many people come to
[34:11] church and they never even raise their
[34:12] hands one time to heaven where they
[34:15] never even shout one time Glory or
[34:17] praise God they can't even get in the
[34:19] spirit that much praise God God help us
[34:22] to be in the spirit Hallelujah and to
[34:25] really mean it praise God not every
[34:28] Service is like that you know I I'm a
[34:30] balance preacher I understand sometimes
[34:32] I'm up I'm sometimes down but when was
[34:34] the last time you felt the Holy Ghost
[34:36] flow out of you like a river praise
[34:39] God
[34:40] hallelujah when was the last time you
[34:42] really felt it flow out of you and you
[34:45] you and you thought my this is what must
[34:47] the day of Pentecost must have been
[34:50] like praise God hallelujah when was the
[34:53] last time you thought that has it been
[34:55] since Napoleon for some of us
[34:59] couple years and church that's not to
[35:01] condemn me or anybody else but last
[35:04] summer I was dancing the spirit praise
[35:06] God uh you know we dance in the spirit
[35:08] sometimes but I'm talking about
[35:09] spontaneous being led of God being so
[35:12] filled with God's spirit you just got to
[35:14] let it flow out like a rushing Mighty
[35:16] River Hallelujah that's what Jesus said
[35:19] it
[35:20] was glory to
[35:22] God how many hearing me tonight by God's
[35:26] grace Glory
[35:29] brother Bram said the acts two saints
[35:31] were informal Holy
[35:35] Rollers now he's talking about uh
[35:38] balum and
[35:41] Bao he said Bao tried to tell balam come
[35:44] over here curse these Israelites I don't
[35:45] want them in my country there's a bunch
[35:47] of Holy Rollers I don't want them in
[35:48] here you say holy rollers brother Braham
[35:50] yes they were Holy Rollers can you prove
[35:51] it yes when they crossed through the red
[35:53] blood of the Red Sea saw the taskmasters
[35:55] Dead behind them poor brother Dr Moses
[35:58] got informal he throwed his hands up in
[36:01] the air began screaming and singing in
[36:02] the Holy Spirit praise God Amen all the
[36:05] task Masters are drowned we're free
[36:08] Hallelujah you're free tonight in the
[36:10] Holy Spirit you don't have to be a slave
[36:12] to sin
[36:13] Hallelujah you're free praise God that's
[36:16] what we need people to be free people to
[36:18] be on fire people that know what they're
[36:20] talking about praise
[36:23] God not just a preacher not just a a
[36:25] singer or something like that everybody
[36:28] can experience the presence of God
[36:31] hallelujah and Miriam the prophetess she
[36:34] got informal and grabbed a tambourine
[36:36] and run down the bank beating and
[36:38] dancing and the daughters of Israel fing
[36:40] her dancing beating on the tambourine if
[36:42] that ain't an old fashion Holy Roller
[36:45] meeting I've never seen one in my life
[36:48] they were informal Holy Rollers you
[36:51] don't want to believe that but that's
[36:52] the truth that's thus sayith the Lord
[36:54] the scripture
[36:58] sure they were Holy Rollers inter
[37:00] denominational Holy
[37:02] Rollers that's the vine over here though
[37:05] Hallelujah so this supports the previous
[37:08] thus sayith the Lord about classical
[37:10] preaching classical preaching just lets
[37:12] everybody shake hands get on your knees
[37:15] like the Catholic we went to the
[37:15] Catholic church at one time and up and
[37:17] down and up and down up down okay then
[37:19] everybody come up and get their wafer
[37:21] that's about all it was I'm like what
[37:22] are they saying in Latin I can't even
[37:23] hardly I can't follow anything don't
[37:25] hear any words now my children might
[37:26] know a few words
[37:28] but it just it's it's just
[37:30] confusion like a Babel Hallelujah by
[37:33] God's grace but that's what we need we
[37:35] need an informal Holy
[37:37] Spirit we need to we need to be under
[37:39] the spirit so we don't do the same thing
[37:41] every single spir every single
[37:44] service Hallelujah
[37:46] church that's what brother BR says the
[37:48] Holy Ghost is
[37:50] spontaneous he might have you
[37:51] spontaneously do something that
[37:53] magnifies his
[37:55] name right just something simple just
[37:57] standing up everybody sitting down just
[37:59] standing up during the preaching when
[38:00] you're blessed that can be the Holy
[38:01] Ghost being
[38:02] spontaneous but if people just do the
[38:04] same thing every single service there's
[38:07] no spontaneous that it's time to go
[38:09] checking up to see if you got the
[38:10] spontaneous one in your soul praise
[38:13] God
[38:15] hallelujah that's right
[38:17] church that's what it was they were not
[38:20] they were not formal uh in the book of
[38:22] Acts they were informal praise
[38:25] God hallelujah
[38:28] now moving on thus sayith the Lord
[38:29] Brother said there's one Prophet
[38:31] messenger uh Malachi Matthew 119 and10
[38:35] would you read that John the Baptist was
[38:36] a prophet messenger a lot of people
[38:38] don't know that he was more than a
[38:40] prophet he was also a messenger of the
[38:43] Covenant right he was preaching pointing
[38:46] them to Christ which would be the New
[38:47] Covenant right and that's what brother
[38:49] Ram is doing here he's a prophet
[38:50] messenger at the end time Same Spirit of
[38:51] Elijah and he's pointing us back to the
[38:53] New Covenant because the churches have
[38:55] rejected it
[38:57] right I'm going to show you a list they
[38:58] cut their hair they get adulteries they
[39:00] basically naked in the church they they
[39:02] they're not going to get the Covenant
[39:03] they're not going to get the Holy
[39:06] Ghost that's right Hallelujah they might
[39:09] not get to heaven brother Rod said and
[39:10] the church Said Amen brother rod that's
[39:13] right they'll be very lucky if they
[39:15] scarcely get into heaven the Bible said
[39:18] if judgment begins at the house of God
[39:20] what about the Sinner and the unbeliever
[39:22] Peter
[39:23] said they scarcely be saved if they
[39:25] repent on their deathbed
[39:27] Mal Matthew uh 119 and
[39:43] 10 very good it's not Sunday night but
[39:45] there's two claps but Hallelujah brother
[39:47] said first we will have one Prophet
[39:49] messenger Revelation 10:7 when he
[39:51] singular shall begin to sound there's
[39:53] never been an age where God gave his
[39:55] people two Major Prophets at one time
[39:57] time he gave Enoch alone Noah alone
[39:59] Moses alone remember even with Ezekiel
[40:02] Jeremiah and uh Isaiah they were all
[40:04] spread out in different places
[40:08] Hallelujah John the Baptist came alone
[40:11] and remember brother brandom said we
[40:13] brother taught we know there's got to be
[40:14] a spirit of Elijah to come at the end
[40:16] time to turn the hearts of the children
[40:18] back to the fathers because John the
[40:20] Baptist was the fathers pointing them to
[40:22] the second coming turn the hearts of the
[40:23] fathers to the children they long to see
[40:25] the coming of the Lord they long to live
[40:27] to see the coming of the
[40:29] Lord you know one of these days church
[40:31] I'm going to preach that both Peter and
[40:32] Paul said the Lord's coming was very
[40:34] soon if you know the Bible well one of
[40:37] these days I'm going to get to that
[40:38] study I just think of it while I'm at
[40:39] the pulpit at the wrong
[40:41] place but both of them said it's very
[40:44] soon it's very soon and people stumble
[40:46] at that like oh maybe they didn't write
[40:47] the Bible no it's not from our
[40:49] perspective it's from God's perspective
[40:51] am
[40:53] Hallelujah that's right church because
[40:56] it's not soon like years it's like soon
[40:59] God a thousand years is has one day with
[41:01] God
[41:03] hallelujah and even in that like we just
[41:06] saw in Corinthians even in that Paul
[41:07] said this is not the Lord talking this
[41:09] is me this is Paul giving my best
[41:13] opinion so what does that mean that
[41:15] means yes that's part of scripture but
[41:17] that's the scripture that's thus sayith
[41:18] the Lord that's Paul's opinion not thus
[41:20] sayith God's word it's just a true
[41:23] record it's a infallible record that
[41:25] that's Paul's opinion
[41:28] just like all the Old Testament right a
[41:29] lot of stories a lot of mistakes their
[41:31] mistakes aren't thus sayth the Lord It's
[41:33] the record of the mistakes that's thus
[41:35] say the Lord everybody with
[41:37] me people try to make Paul's opinions
[41:39] thus say the Lord right but it's not he
[41:41] said this is my opinion just like they
[41:43] try to make brother Ram's opinions thus
[41:45] say the lord it's the same demon same
[41:47] same demon power right it's the same
[41:49] Spirit of idolatry it's say Antichrist
[41:51] Spirit trying to exalt a man but God
[41:53] said I will not share my glory with
[41:55] anybody praise God I only I only give it
[41:58] to myself
[42:00] Hallelujah now now in the last day there
[42:02] is to be a prophet not a prophetess
[42:03] though in this age there are more women
[42:05] purporting to give God's revelation than
[42:07] men that's true and the infallible word
[42:10] says that he the prophet will turn the
[42:11] Mysteries Revelation 10:7 to the end
[42:13] time people and turn the hearts of the
[42:15] children back to the fathers Revelation
[42:17] I'm sorry Malachi 4:6 there are those
[42:19] who say that God's people are going to
[42:20] come together through a collective
[42:22] Revelation I challenge that statement
[42:24] it's a bald invalid assumption in the
[42:26] face of Revelation 107
[42:28] now I do not deny that people will
[42:29] prophesy in this last age and their
[42:31] Ministries can and will be correct I do
[42:33] not deny that there will be prophets
[42:34] even as in the days of Paul when there
[42:36] was one agabus a prophet who prophesied
[42:38] of a
[42:39] famine I agree that is so but I deny
[42:42] upon the infallible evidence of the word
[42:44] that there's more than one major prophet
[42:46] messenger who reveal the Mysteries like
[42:48] the Seven Seals like the church ages
[42:50] like the godhead
[42:52] Hallelujah contained in the word and who
[42:55] has the ministry to turn the hearts of
[42:56] the children to the fathers thus sayith
[42:58] the Lord by his unfailing words stands
[43:01] and shall and be Vindicated there's one
[43:04] Prophet Messenger to this age and our
[43:06] church said
[43:07] amen like brother Ram said bring up any
[43:10] preacher in these last UH 60 years since
[43:12] brother Ram's uh been off the scene show
[43:14] me one who has all these thus sayi the
[43:16] Lords that are correct like brother Ram
[43:18] there's not a one of them this many all
[43:21] the way all this list here I'm just
[43:23] scratching the surface of it here by
[43:24] God's grace putting the word together by
[43:27] the leadership of the Holy Spirit there
[43:29] can only be one Prophet Messenger to the
[43:31] age just like John the Baptist was the
[43:33] one Prophet Messenger to point them to
[43:35] Christ brother R is the one Prophet
[43:36] Messenger to point us back to Christ
[43:39] Hallelujah that's right brother ramam
[43:42] said thus sayth the Lord a woman with
[43:43] cut hair is not born again thus sayeth
[43:46] the Lord and he uses Old Testament
[43:49] scripture and New Testament
[43:52] scripture you say cutting hair what's it
[43:54] got to do brother let's stop here a
[43:55] minute I feel somebody resenting that
[43:57] might have been out there on the wire
[43:58] somewhere listen a hair to the woman is
[44:00] a Nazarite vow hair to Samson was a
[44:02] Nazarite vow and when a woman cuts off
[44:05] her hair she absolutely denies her
[44:06] Nazarite vow that she's a bride to
[44:08] Christ because there that one thing she
[44:10] spoils the whole picture correct a
[44:13] Nazarite is one that's consecrated for a
[44:14] purpose is that right Samson was
[44:16] consecrated to an age and to a purpose
[44:18] therefore he had long hair the woman
[44:20] that's a child of God lets her hair grow
[44:22] to show that she's consecrated to every
[44:23] word of God in fact that's what the hair
[44:25] represents the word of God
[44:29] and so you wouldn't you wouldn't allow
[44:30] me brother Patrick you wouldn't allow me
[44:32] to say oh can I cut out Revelation 20
[44:35] can I just cut that out you he's already
[44:36] shaking his head
[44:37] no that's the same thing a woman should
[44:39] say when hear some scissors can I trim
[44:41] your hair no no like instantly no no
[44:43] don't touch my
[44:45] hair because the Bible says the spirit
[44:47] of God is your covering and the spirit
[44:50] and the word are
[44:51] one so a woman's uncut hair means all
[44:54] the words she's under all the leadership
[44:56] all the the headship of the word praise
[44:58] God do you know that's in the Bible the
[45:01] Bible said the spirit is the covering
[45:02] it's Isaiah now I think it's Chapter 30
[45:05] but uh I'll get
[45:07] it I just came across that as I was
[45:09] reading through Isaiah I finished Isaiah
[45:10] n in Song of
[45:13] Solomon
[45:14] Spirit if I could spell it right
[45:31] yes it's Isaiah 30 ver1 woe to the
[45:33] rebellious children and sayth the Lord
[45:35] that take counsel but not of me that
[45:37] cover with the covering but not with my
[45:38] spirit that they may add sin to sin so
[45:40] what was the covering in the Old
[45:41] Testament the Holy
[45:43] Spirit right and now go to 1 Corinthians
[45:45] 11 what's the Bible say is a covering
[45:47] the hair is the covering not a cloth
[45:49] like I saw some women today nice women
[45:50] but they got Closs on thinking that
[45:52] makes them holy church that's a man-made
[45:54] covering God's covering is a holy God
[45:57] made
[45:57] covering I just proved it to you right
[46:00] God can't change he can't have a
[46:01] spiritual covering uh and then change
[46:04] the covering to a man-made cloth
[46:05] covering or a hat or whatever it is Cap
[46:09] 1 Corinthians
[46:13] 11 always excited about them
[46:17] caps verse 15 1 Corinthians 11:15 but if
[46:20] a woman have long hair it's a glory for
[46:22] her for her hair is given her for a
[46:25] covering and that's the verse I share
[46:27] with those sisters on uh Christmas Eve
[46:29] 2023 that's that's the day they got
[46:31] delivered from that demonic power of the
[46:34] cloth is the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[46:36] and that's the night the Satan attacked
[46:37] me and tried to choke me to death but my
[46:39] wife called on Jesus twice Jesus Jesus
[46:42] and the choking left hallelujah thank
[46:44] God my wife's casting off demons
[46:46] Hallelujah that's right church so it is
[46:49] music you come in here all bundled up
[46:51] and all angry or all distracted and
[46:53] Malachi plays a song or sings a song and
[46:55] you get free the devil just was cast out
[47:00] Hallelujah just like David
[47:02] did see she's kind this the covering is
[47:05] the spirit or now the hair is a covering
[47:08] but it represents the spirit or the word
[47:11] you don't cut off some of the word and
[47:12] say I can do without that we need all
[47:14] the word of God brother said if she cuts
[47:16] it off I don't care how much she dances
[47:19] sings in the choir speaks in tongues
[47:21] runs up and down all kind of Aid
[47:23] societies she's dead that's thus sayith
[47:25] the Lord the word of God
[47:27] now he quotes the wrong scripture it's 1
[47:29] Corinthians 11 but that's after the word
[47:31] that's after the sentence ends so he
[47:33] goes back into his human side yeah she's
[47:36] denied her Nazarite vow and sold out to
[47:38] the god of the Modern Age she does it
[47:40] now shame on you ler
[47:42] woman right like I said that last time
[47:45] that's the challenge show me one verse
[47:46] God asked a Godly woman to cut her hair
[47:48] you'll never find it you'll be reading
[47:51] into the tribulation
[47:53] period right because you be left here
[47:54] you won't go in the rapture
[47:57] and church you know why look it up in
[47:59] your Bible well I'm sorry not I'm
[48:01] talking to the I'm talk I'm not talking
[48:02] to you guys I'm talking to the audience
[48:04] I'm talking about the critics I'm sorry
[48:06] I don't mean to talk like that the
[48:08] critics need to look it up in their
[48:10] Bible starting to get a little bit
[48:13] angry uh righteous anger that's right
[48:16] right be angry and sin not look up the
[48:20] word dishonor means to put shame who
[48:23] suffers the repulse or whom some Hope
[48:25] Has deceived when a woman cuts her hair
[48:28] it's like she's deceived her husband
[48:31] she's brought a repulse to her husband
[48:33] what's a repulse it's a intense distaste
[48:35] or dislike it's just H you've
[48:38] disrespected me you've Dishonored me
[48:41] it's a repulse it's a disgusting thing
[48:43] she's trying to be a man she's trying to
[48:45] take my role I'm I'm the
[48:47] husband that's right right you've all
[48:50] heard him say though you've all heard
[48:51] some of these worldly women say I'm
[48:52] going to go cut my hair and show my
[48:53] husband I've had people tell me that
[48:55] women I'm going to go cut my hair to
[48:56] show my husband who's the boss it's all
[48:59] over you can find on social media too
[49:00] just look at
[49:01] it that that that's what it is that's
[49:04] what the Bible says that's not what
[49:06] brother brandom said or brother Jesse or
[49:08] brother anybody it's what the Bible says
[49:10] how many Bible believers do we have here
[49:12] it's also a shame which means
[49:14] dishonorable same thing so see it's kind
[49:16] of a little bit re reciprocal repetitive
[49:18] there by God's grace it's a repulse for
[49:21] women to put scissors to her
[49:23] hair because it represents the spirit of
[49:26] God represents the word of God it's the
[49:28] same repulse for a man to grow out
[49:30] dreadlocks like they do or whatever they
[49:32] do they got long hair like a woman uh
[49:34] flows like they got uh Head and
[49:36] Shoulders on or something like that it's
[49:38] just as dishonorable and disgusting for
[49:40] a man to not cut his hair that's
[49:44] right now this stumbles
[49:47] people but in the but in the old days it
[49:50] was so serious because people were more
[49:52] knowledgeable about the word of God
[49:54] today you know a godly man if his wife
[49:56] cut her hair she he might be discouraged
[49:58] but it was so serious in brother bram's
[50:00] day it was so serious they would
[50:02] threaten divorce now God hates
[50:05] divorce but it was such a serious thing
[50:09] that the the man could he he he could
[50:12] divorce her but he couldn't remarry
[50:14] again because there's only one cause for
[50:17] remarriage now I can't find a Bible
[50:19] example where that ever happened but
[50:21] what would you say what would a husband
[50:22] say if he felt totally repulsed by his
[50:24] wife disrespected by his wife or she
[50:27] started wearing the flapper skirts and
[50:28] started smoking and cutting her hair and
[50:30] going out like the flappers of the 1920s
[50:32] he has a right he can put her away but
[50:34] he just can't marry again because the
[50:37] only cause for remarriage we went
[50:38] through was unconfessed fornication of a
[50:40] vow a false vow we went through that
[50:43] like Jesus said in Matthew 5 and Matthew
[50:45] 19 and also the chapter on vows I think
[50:48] it's numbers 18 if I'm not mistaken
[50:51] brother says let me tell you something a
[50:52] lot of you women this is in 56 again
[50:54] this was the year yeah this was the year
[50:56] go brother said thus say the lord it's
[50:57] this year America will turn back to God
[50:59] back to the zusa Street Revival or
[51:01] she'll go further into sin thus sayith
[51:03] the Lord and look what's happened to her
[51:05] do you also know 56 was the year Elvis
[51:07] went
[51:07] skyrocketing uh uh popular see they
[51:11] chose Judas instead of brother
[51:13] brandham right brother is not God I'm
[51:15] just saying they chose Judas instead of
[51:17] the prophet of God right in other words
[51:19] they chose uh Janis and jamers instead
[51:21] of Moses they chose balum instead of
[51:23] Moses something like that I'm not
[51:24] exalting brother bandam you know me okay
[51:27] you know me
[51:29] people I'm just saying they reject the
[51:31] word of God and they take a judas's
[51:34] scariot who sold out uh Elvis Presley
[51:37] brother knew brother brother knew Elvis
[51:39] Presley's mother and pastor and he
[51:41] learned some of those movements in the
[51:44] church but then he perverted them he
[51:47] perverted some of the movements in the
[51:48] freedom right just the joy of the Lord
[51:50] you know think about the joy of the Lord
[51:51] how we could but he perverted it started
[51:53] shaking the wrong body parts Hallelujah
[51:57] brother B said his mother was
[51:59] disappointed in him and the preacher was
[52:00] all disappointed just like the modern
[52:02] day uh who is that Beyonce that started
[52:04] in church all these people start in

[52:26] whendy Houston you'll die in your
[52:28] bathtub who knows what the rest of these
[52:30] people are going to die like what a
[52:33] disgrace you want to die like uh FF
[52:38] Bosworth brother raham said for a whole
[52:40] hour he was on his deathbed and he was
[52:43] hugging invisible people that God used
[52:45] him to save for a whole hour before he
[52:47] died Hallelujah that's how we want to
[52:50] die hallelujah amen or like sister Karen
[52:54] Ro's mother when she and all four
[52:56] brothers were in there in the hospital
[52:58] in Arizona they heard angels singing in
[53:00] the room before she
[53:02] died
[53:04] Hallelujah that's how you want to die if
[53:07] if you die some of you might not die we
[53:09] might not die there's a possibility amen
[53:12] glory to God we could be changed in the
[53:14] moment twinkling of an
[53:20] eye but let me tell you something he's
[53:22] talking about when the woman uh wash
[53:24] took down her hair and washed jesus'
[53:25] feet with her hair now look I love this
[53:27] joke brother man say a lot of you women
[53:29] tonight would have an awful time doing
[53:30] that you'd have to stand on your head to
[53:32] do it and that'd be a modest right well
[53:35] they probably have pants on anyway
[53:37] that's an Abomination anyhow to wear a
[53:40] man's
[53:41] garment shame on you brother says this
[53:44] is in 56 50 years after the Holy Ghost
[53:47] Fell inza Street the Bible said the hair
[53:50] is given to a woman for her
[53:52] glory and the Bible gives rights gives
[53:55] any man a right to leave and divor
[53:56] divorce and leave his wife that'll cut
[53:57] her hair that's the Bible CU it's a
[53:59] repulse that's thus sayith the Lord too
[54:02] bad you got away from the oldfashioned
[54:03] trainings isn't it remember 1
[54:05] Corinthians 7 the Bible said uh if
[54:07] they're not pleased to dwell together
[54:08] they can go their separate ways but they
[54:10] either got to remain single or come back
[54:12] together that's the Bible evidence right
[54:15] there a a wife disrespect a husband like
[54:18] that now church I've heard this trash
[54:20] around the
[54:22] message people men will try to talk
[54:25] their wives into getting to their hair
[54:26] just so they can divorce them and marry
[54:28] a younger woman that's demon
[54:30] possession that's a demon possessed man
[54:34] who's got a spirit of lust he's got a
[54:35] spirit of adultery on him that's right
[54:39] but see they don't even read the quote
[54:40] where can brother where do you ever say
[54:41] you can marry again and if even if he
[54:43] said it it's got to be in the Bible and
[54:45] it don't say it in the Bible praise God
[54:48] deceived demon possessed people too bad
[54:51] you got away from the oldfashioned
[54:52] training isn't it we used to sing we let
[54:54] down the bars we compromise with sin you
[54:56] let let down the bars the Sheep got out
[54:58] but how did the goats get in because you
[54:59] let down the bars that's how the goats
[55:02] get in you start compromising on the
[55:05] scripture that's why like last week
[55:07] people that come here I know they're
[55:08] wearing makeup I'm going to preach on
[55:10] makeup like I did because I don't care
[55:13] what they say I'm not taking the bars
[55:15] down I'm GNA preach God's word I'm GNA
[55:16] keep the goats out
[55:18] hallelujah
[55:20] amen or I know they're cutting their
[55:22] hair I'm going to preach on
[55:24] hair you don't want to serve God you
[55:26] don't don't have to but if you want to
[55:27] serve God welcome home hallelujah praise
[55:30] God
[55:31] Amen we don't want goats to get in
[55:35] here like I've said before when I
[55:37] received this message nobody had to ask
[55:39] me to come to church nobody had to ask
[55:41] me to pray and read my Bible nobody had
[55:43] to ask me to pay
[55:44] ties nobody had to ask me to do anything
[55:47] because I was in love with Jesus and
[55:49] when you love Jesus you keep the
[55:50] commands Hallelujah nobody ask asked me
[55:53] to say please don't wear short shorts
[55:54] brother Jesse
[55:56] nobody say please don't uh let your hair
[55:58] grow long brother Jesse because God was
[56:00] already telling me that and because I
[56:03] love God I obeyed
[56:05] God and when we got to beg people and
[56:07] kind of move them on and ask them to
[56:09] obey the word of God they're not born
[56:12] again that's right
[56:14] Church boy kind of a hard sermon tonight
[56:17] huh anybody else got a red face out
[56:21] there boy the preacher is preaching hard
[56:23] tonight it's a Well I got to sometimes
[56:25] it's the the word of God it's thus
[56:27] sayeth the
[56:28] Lord
[56:32] hallelujah remember the only woman who
[56:34] ever painted her face Jezebel the dogs
[56:36] licked her
[56:38] blood right that's the only woman once
[56:41] Jezebel and then twice Israel said to
[56:43] have pain in their faces to go make love
[56:45] to all their Heathen Idols they actually
[56:48] did that they paint in their faces and
[56:50] go out there and sacrific their children
[56:52] to idols and adulteries and fornications
[56:54] they actually did that
[56:57] it's a heathen trait
[56:59] Hallelujah remember I love that verse
[57:01] don't the Bible say David didn't said uh
[57:04] David said God Made You fearfully and
[57:06] wonderfully so paint your face no he
[57:09] didn't say that he said God already made
[57:12] you fearfully and wonderfully wonderful
[57:15] are God's Works
[57:18] Hallelujah Glory
[57:26] got five
[57:29] minutes brother BR said thus sayith the
[57:31] Lord on denomination of
[57:33] fruit after all the denominations is
[57:35] played out they didn't have any light to
[57:37] begin with uh there'll be a day that
[57:39] can't be called day or night that's
[57:40] speaking of Zechariah what do they
[57:42] doing what what are they doing what does
[57:45] a Lemon do on an orange tree so brother
[57:46] man says the True Believers like an
[57:48] orange on an orange tree but you can cut
[57:50] the branches on orange tree and Graft in
[57:52] other fruit tree branches but it'll
[57:54] still produce the previous tree that
[57:56] they're a part of like a lemon if you
[57:58] put a lemon Branch into a apple Tre I'm
[58:00] sorry into a orange tree branch the life
[58:02] of that orange tree will will go through
[58:05] the uh the the new grafted Branch but it
[58:07] still produce a lemon even though it's
[58:09] uh connected to the life of the orange
[58:11] tree Hallelujah brother Ram had Deus
[58:14] sharan showed him that he showed him all
[58:15] these different fruits coming out of the
[58:17] same tree but it's an orange tree and
[58:19] that's what brother Ram learned here he
[58:21] learned that all these different
[58:22] churches are they they draw life from
[58:24] the Holy Spirit but they produce the
[58:27] life of the tree that they're from so
[58:29] they're going to produce Baptist fruit
[58:30] or Methodist fruit hallelujah or
[58:32] Catholic
[58:33] fruit right I've known Catholics that uh
[58:37] I've known Catholics that have good
[58:38] testimonies brother R said he prayed for
[58:40] many Catholics and God did miracles for
[58:42] many
[58:43] Catholics right and they can be nice
[58:45] people they can be very kind
[58:47] people but look at their look at their
[58:50] whole life look at the entire fruit of
[58:52] their
[58:53] life Glory
[58:57] he says it what does a Lemon do on an
[58:59] orange tree it takes the original life
[59:01] of the orange that's coming up and
[59:02] perverts it through a lemon that's what
[59:04] the denominations has done to the word
[59:05] of God made the word of God of none
[59:07] effect by their Traditions that's thus
[59:09] sayith the spirit of the Lord now that's
[59:10] a statement right
[59:12] there they brought forth lemons
[59:14] grapefruits and not oranges just like
[59:16] the Pharisees of Jesus day they said
[59:18] they sat Moses seat but they wanted to
[59:20] kill the one Moses wrote
[59:22] about they said they were the children
[59:24] of Abraham but they wanted the kill the
[59:26] one who said before Abraham was I am
[59:29] Hallelujah see wrong
[59:32] fruit right they go to widow's houses
[59:34] and make merchandise of women try to get
[59:36] their money and everything Hallelujah
[59:39] that's the wrong kind of fruit that's
[59:40] not Holy Ghost fruit praise God and
[59:43] that's what we got today look at these
[59:45] just the examples again look at the
[59:47] corrupt fruit in
[59:49] denominations look at the corrupt fruits
[59:51] that they've done to the thus say the
[59:53] Lord truth so instead of taking brother
[59:55] AMS thus sayith the Lord
[59:56] back that take us back to the Bible
[59:58] they'd rather have corrupt
[1:00:00] fruit and they so a lot of them won't
[1:00:02] even talk about brother Brandon the only
[1:00:04] ones that will are so deceived they're
[1:00:06] the NRA people I'm sorry NR yeah NRA new
[1:00:10] uh n New Apostolic Reformation they call
[1:00:14] themselves Apostles and they're not they
[1:00:17] call themselves prophets and they're not
[1:00:18] like the Bill Johnson the bethl group
[1:00:20] The Kenneth Copeland Group all those
[1:00:22] hyper
[1:00:23] charismatics they're the only ones that
[1:00:25] talk about brother brandom because they
[1:00:28] they want the Miracles of brother Bram
[1:00:29] but they don't want the doctrine of
[1:00:30] brother brandham which is actually the
[1:00:32] doctrine of the Bible so they don't want
[1:00:35] the Bible they want the signs Miracles
[1:00:36] and wonders but they don't want the god
[1:00:38] they don't want the holy life of the
[1:00:40] Bible praise God that's right
[1:00:44] church so what do they do they allow
[1:00:47] adulteries and they reject thus sayith
[1:00:49] the Lord on marriage and
[1:00:51] divorce what kind of fruit is
[1:00:53] that they allow immodest clothing like
[1:00:55] sexy dressed women they reject thus
[1:00:57] sayith the Lord all modesty that we have
[1:01:00] they allow disgusting crossdressing and
[1:01:03] we got thus sayith the Lord out of the
[1:01:04] Bible and look at all this trans
[1:01:05] movement and the perversion of seeing a
[1:01:07] man dressed like a woman you see just
[1:01:09] see it this week a a trans boy tried to
[1:01:11] go into a girls bathroom and calls all
[1:01:13] this just another Wicked thing this week
[1:01:15] another all these girls there in the in
[1:01:17] the bathroom Are all uh scarred because
[1:01:20] of this it's a sexual
[1:01:23] perversion to crossdress
[1:01:26] right it's total sexual
[1:01:28] perversion it's exactly right God said
[1:01:31] it back in uh 1500 BC in the days of
[1:01:35] Moses
[1:01:38] Hallelujah and they allow false
[1:01:40] conversions tell people they have the
[1:01:41] Holy Ghost when they don't makes a bunch
[1:01:44] of deceived church members do I got it
[1:01:46] do I not do I got it do they not if God
[1:01:48] ever fell on you you would know you got
[1:01:50] it because your life lines up with the
[1:01:51] word of God hallelujah and everybody
[1:01:54] could see it and everybody could hear it
[1:01:56] praise God that's right
[1:01:58] Glory that's
[1:02:00] right see they reject thus sayith the
[1:02:02] Lord on the well I don't want to take
[1:02:04] Acts 19 like my dear friend he was a
[1:02:06] good man too I don't that doesn't apply
[1:02:08] to us well then who does it apply
[1:02:11] to how when did you get anointed to uh
[1:02:15] be able to say you're the one who gets
[1:02:16] us choose what applies and what
[1:02:20] doesn't oh yeah he said you can't make
[1:02:23] the book of Acts Doctrine
[1:02:26] where did you ever hear that from the
[1:02:27] Bible said in Acts two they gave
[1:02:29] themselves to Doctrine and the reading
[1:02:30] of the word so as soon as they got saved
[1:02:33] they want a Doctrine they want to know
[1:02:35] how to live right that's what we want to
[1:02:38] know how do we live
[1:02:40] right Glory if you ever get saved if you
[1:02:43] really fall in love with God you'll
[1:02:44] gladly receive the word of God and you
[1:02:46] want more of the doctrine more of the
[1:02:48] Miracles more of the love of God you and
[1:02:50] all that God has for you praise God but
[1:02:52] don't forget you got to be a partaker of
[1:02:53] the suffering as well
[1:02:56] everybody wants the power of the
[1:02:57] Resurrection but you remember you must
[1:02:59] suffer and in suffering is fellowship
[1:03:02] Hallelujah that's when you really
[1:03:04] fellowship with God when you suffer with
[1:03:06] him he becomes real to you you realize
[1:03:10] oh he is with me he never left me he
[1:03:12] never forsook me in my suffering and
[1:03:15] then I can have Fellowship oh Lord I
[1:03:16] know I know a little bit of taste of how
[1:03:18] you felt I know a little bit of how job
[1:03:20] I know a little bit how Paul I know
[1:03:22] about the persecution I know about the
[1:03:25] suffering
[1:03:28] Hallelujah and then they deny the
[1:03:30] prophet messenger like the God's General
[1:03:33] guy they deny the the very messenger God
[1:03:36] sent to
[1:03:40] them and then they allow women to
[1:03:42] repulse their husbands and not just
[1:03:44] their husbands then they repulse Christ
[1:03:46] and then they repulse God according to
[1:03:49] the Holy Ghost headship in 1 Corinthians
[1:03:51] chapter
[1:03:52] 11 I think I'll stop right there let's
[1:03:55] into our feet by God's
[1:03:57] grace that's the hour there I passed my
[1:04:00] over I went a little over hour Malachi
[1:04:02] can come here by God's
[1:04:08] grace so next time by God's grace we'll
[1:04:10] pick up
[1:04:13] there how many enjoying the thus sayith
[1:04:15] the Lords praise God it's a real uh it's
[1:04:18] a real uh blessing to us I'm going put
[1:04:21] part two on there so I don't forget
[1:04:31] Hallelujah in every age Church in every
[1:04:33] age when God sent a prophet the Bible
[1:04:36] said if they received it the Bible said
[1:04:38] God will prosper you right I think it's
[1:04:41] 2 Chronicles 20:20 says receive His
[1:04:44] prophets and God will prosper you and
[1:04:46] I'm just paraphrasing and church what's
[1:04:48] the prospering people want today they
[1:04:49] just want big bank accounts that's what
[1:04:51] they think is prospering but that's not
[1:04:53] real
[1:04:54] prospering it's having the character of
[1:04:56] Christ that's what profits us on this
[1:04:59] Earth
[1:05:00] hallelujah it's to be able to suffer
[1:05:02] like Christ and yes to pray for the sick
[1:05:04] or or speak the word of God or speak to
[1:05:06] the mountain or something like that
[1:05:08] those are all wonderful things but
[1:05:10] that's the Prosper remember the Bible
[1:05:12] said I wish you prosper in health even
[1:05:13] as your soul it's about the prospering
[1:05:16] of your spiritual nature your soul the
[1:05:20] very person that you are and that's all
[1:05:22] you're taking to heaven with you is the
[1:05:24] person that you be come through the word
[1:05:26] of
[1:05:28] God hallelujah and that's given to us
[1:05:31] with thus sayeth the Lord the scriptures
[1:05:34] hallelujah what a blessing let's bow our
[1:05:37] heads here
[1:05:38] tonight Heavenly Father Lord I've been
[1:05:41] very strict and straight tonight Lord I
[1:05:44] following your leadership Lord by the
[1:05:46] grace of God thank you Lord for these
[1:05:48] thus say the Lord sometimes we need a
[1:05:51] reminder Lord God I know I
[1:05:54] do Lord it reminds us that because we
[1:05:57] are the sons and daughters of God you
[1:05:59] have sent forth your spirit in our
[1:06:00] hearts crying ABA
[1:06:03] father Lord and it shows when our
[1:06:05] friends or loved ones they walk away
[1:06:07] from this ministry of brother brandham
[1:06:09] they're walking away from thus saith the
[1:06:11] Lord the truth of the
[1:06:13] Bible Lord Our Hope and prayer is that
[1:06:15] they can be saved Lord God that they
[1:06:18] will not blaspheme that they will not
[1:06:19] speak against
[1:06:20] it hope and prayer Lord is that their
[1:06:23] hearts will eventually change and
[1:06:24] those'll see there's something different
[1:06:25] about sister there's something different
[1:06:27] about our brother I need to go look into
[1:06:30] that again I just read that in my Bible
[1:06:32] I just heard that preached the Holy
[1:06:35] Spirit quickens something to
[1:06:37] me

[1:07:10] suffering to have fellowship with you
