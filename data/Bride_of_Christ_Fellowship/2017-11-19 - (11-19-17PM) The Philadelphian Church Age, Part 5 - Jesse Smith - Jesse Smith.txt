ages and really curbed by that this is part 44 that's what Revelation chapter 3 verse 8 I'll just be in 45 minutes here I don't want to go much longer than that so we'll just try to keep it right straight to the word revelation 3 verse 8 I truly enjoy Church ages praise God it's been a wonderful series and it's been such a refresher to go back through the church age book it's just been wonderful and so thankful for the inspiration it provides us I'll read that quote again what the Prophet said and he said when you read the church ages and get the revelation it prepares you for the rapture so it's so needed in this hour revelation 3 verse 8 so get the open door I may have to preach maybe two or three sermons on the open door there's a lot the Prophet gives us on the open door so we'll just read verse eight tonight let's read it together on three one two three I know thy works behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou hast a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name it's Bauer heads here and if you have meat on your heart just make it on in to God Heavenly Father were grateful to be in your house again tonight or speak to us through thy word Lord thank you for the open door and as we'll see Lord you've you've had many open doors Lord God in the scripture there's many ways to apply this so thank you Lord God that you open the door for us Lord in this hour in our lives dear God in this city Lord Jesus and also father of this whole age Lord the whole age of the open door to Philadelphia and then the entire Gentile dispensation as an open door so father were grateful Lord God and Lord we're looking forward to that meeting in the air Lord as we just sang about Lord and those that have already gone before we look forward to meeting them just inside the eastern gate father we thank you Lord God let your spirit be not to us in Jesus Christ's name never said even God best should be in seat of their praise God [Music] well had it real good time studying this I think I studied this on Wednesday and I never got to it preach it on Wednesday night because I preached longer on the other statements but let me just read this again here and malachi you know what maybe we'll just show these slides here by God's grace remember in the church age book I just thought it'd be good to read this again by God's grace to encourage our hearts where the Prophet said though this volume will concern itself with various major doctrines such as Godhead water baptism etc found in Revelation chapters one through three its main theme is setting forth of a detailed study the seven church ages this is necessary in order to study and understand the rest of the revelation four out of the ages come the seals and out of the seals come the trumpets now the trumpets come the vials like the first burst of a roman candle the church ages comes forth with the mighty initial illumination without which there could be no further light that's amazing why you have to understand the church ages before you can even understand the seals the right way or the judgments of God the Tribulation Period and the vials that's all tribulation period so the Prophet says it without which so without this understanding of this wonderful church age book the Prophet gave us the seals would not have come that the understanding of it and that's the order - God gave you know brother Branham that's the church ages in 1960 and three years later you know in 1963 he gives them the seven seals and I just want you to see that again you know this is necessary it's necessary for me to teach the seven church ages because the prophets said it was necessary and Jesus said it was necessary so we're grateful for that and hope you're enjoying this series by God's grace also he said but the brilliance of the seven church ages is given by divine revelation so when you when we hear these things they should say my we should say that was brilliant the Holy Spirit gave the fit brilliant understanding of the Word of God that's what we should say it should be brilliant to us because this divine revelation light upon light follows until the whole of the revelation opened wide before our wandering eyes and we edified and purified by its spirit are made ready for this glorious appearing even our Lord and Savior the one true God Jesus Christ I don't know about you but I'm sure it was with you after you first heard the church ages and then heard the seven seals you finally were able understand the rest of the book of Revelation right and it should have opened up like he said it should have been light upon light and you and when you first read it right your eyes wandered like you you wonder at the Bible with admiration this Bible is a new Bible we know everything in the book of Revelation we know all the symbols we know the order and we looked at it with eyes of wondering didn't we and let's not forget that initial illumination let's ask God for a little more illumination tonight by God's grace Lord give us a little more illumination tonight because it's brilliant if we'll see it in the light where the scripture brings it and I love this we edified and purified by its Spirit are made ready for the glorious appearing even our Lord and Savior the one true God Jesus Christ because I remember the Prophet did tell us remember he said thus saith the Lord all the interpretations in the churches and the seals and the history were thus say at the Lord and that's what revelation as we saw this morning ok so here's my thoughts I want to do for today tonight by God's grace remember we're in the sixth church H from 1750 to 1906 they had a little more light in this age and they did in the Sardis age and John Wesley lived from 1703 to 1791 now the prophets spent most of his time on the truth of the open door in the 1960 sermon so if you go through and listen that I don't know if you have my wife was listen to it last week and but I listened to it of course you know before that he spent most of the time so most of the quotes from the 1960 sermon on the open door I'll bring out probably Wednesday but I want you to again look at the outline let's look at the outline again and he spends over an hour just on the open door because the open door thought is more than just missionary aged Philadelphia so in other words that idea the open door is more than just confined to the sixth church age there's actually different kinds of open doors that's what one look at tonight I want to go through the scriptures on the open doors okay so here's the outline the first two minutes after the introduction were the aged messenger then he reviewed the previous ages for about seven minutes and then he did more on Wesley's history performance now all this in orange the next two slides is all open door so he spent a total of 68 minutes almost 70 minutes of the two-hour sermon on the open door so let's go back there he talks about the open door missionary age empower and not word only so signs wonders and miracles for the Gentile church age he spends 23 minutes on that and then he takes 22 minutes on how Jesus is the open door how Jesus is God the name of Jesus and the Holy Ghost covenant even goes back to Abraham and shows how the Abrahamic covenant started in Genesis and then even extends to us in Galatians chapter 3 it teaches us that or for I believe and then he takes five minutes on the supreme deity of Christ and the key of David and then he takes 18 more minutes on how this age had a little strength and that strength was in the deity of Christ and the name of Christ and water baptism and then so a total of 68 minutes on the open door so like I said Wednesday we'll go through those quotes I haven't got those on the slideshow I just did the scriptures on this slideshow so we're looking at the slideshow here tonight while these slides I should say and then he's takes about 20 well 3 10 13 14 minutes on synagogue of satan' takes 14 minutes on that we looked at that a little bit a few weeks ago and then he takes about 10 18 minutes on the hour temptation the crown the pillar and the new name and they close with that okay now I'm going to skip past this here I had a few quotes I think I'll use those on Wednesday let's just look at the scriptures here tonight will take about a half hour by God's grace how many thankful for the open door tonight oh so thankful let's go to john 10:7 this is where the prophet starts in the church age book door john 10:7 or jesus says i am the door so malachi can read up for us john 10:7 amen all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the Sheep did not hear them what of what a blessing amen the real sheep never heard those thieves and robbers I am the door by Me If any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture the thief cometh not before to steal and to kill and destroy I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly I am The Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd his life for the Sheep we'll just stop right there by God's grace all right now I wanna let me slip skip ahead to this here and then we'll prove it by the scripture let's look at this slide I made here there are the following open doors in the scripture there's the open door during the Philadelphian church age that's the one we just read a revelation 3/8 there's the open door for the Gentile dispensation and Pentecost so we're going to show these by the scripture there's an open door to local ministries there's an open door to heaven by vision because John was caught up by the open door he said the door was open there's the open door response that Jesus requests by Christ to the Laotian Church H remember II said knock knocking if you open the door to see there's there's a lot of applications to the open door there's not just one like we said there's not just one to the Philadelphian church age and that's why it's so important that we just don't well I'll leave the open door just to Philadelphia we got to remember God Christ is saying open the door to me today we've got to open our hearts door to Christ today in the Laodicean Church age and then there's the open door requested by the workers of iniquity but they will be denied so they asked they asked for the door to be open too late right so we know if Jesus is not Jesus is offering it right now and we got to be ready right now but they're gonna ask too late so now let's go through these scriptures here let's go back and we'll go through a few scriptures let's go to this one right here let's go to Luke 13:23 and maybe we can have some readers in just a moment Luke 13:23 I want you to see the thought of the open door through the scripture 13:23 so this is the group of the workers of iniquity remember this is the same group for Matthew 7:21 they've done miracles they've cast out demons they've done all these things but they never knew Christ they never went through the open door they just had the anointing right of the Holy Spirit and they never went through the door they never went through the word they never went through the message of the hour amen I say God let me go through all the message of the hour hallelujah Luke 20 to 30 I'm sorry 1323 I'm sorry I said the wrong thing okay I got that but I would like to read tonight by God sorry sister Wendy can you read 23 to 25 look at this thought Church isn't that striking jesus said in verse 24 many are gonna try to enter in and won't be able many that means many people in the tribulation are gonna realize there's trouble this is God's judgment I want to enter in and Jesus says many people now we think of the weather seven billion on the earth right now so that's the population think about when the rapture goes it's gonna be one percent of that or one in a million or a real small number brother Branham says and then many people are gonna realize the wrath of God is upon this earth and they're gonna try to go through the door and they're gonna knock and say they're gonna pray right that's what mother Ram said they're not gonna we're gonna come back the rapture has already come and they didn't know it right they're gonna knock and say Lord Lord and Jesus will say to them I know not whence you are so maybe that voice will also come and say that I don't know who you are I didn't know you you didn't open the door you didn't open the door of your heart to me when you had the chance right you didn't come through the word when you had the chance to come through that's a striking thought right there and many church many people are gonna realize something's going on chaos is happening right the wrath of God I say god I open all my heart to you take all my heart I want to I want to go through all the world I'm gonna go through every door of God amen I don't open every door in my heart to Christ I want all of Christ in me right now amen now look at verse 26 then shall you begin to say we have eaten and drunken in thy presence and thou has taught in our streets but he shall say I tell you I know not whence you are depart from me all ye that workers of iniquity Wow and that's striking again see we were in your presence see they had the anointing that the presence of God right in his presence is fullness of joy these people experience the presence of God oh we're right in your presence but they never went through the word they never had a word based experience they just had the anointing workers of iniquity remember they see they're living in sin but also enjoying the anointing we got to have both we gotta the anointing and a life of purity verse 28 there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when ye shall see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God and you yourselves thrust out this is speaking to Jews but also the Gentiles right because this is the age where he said they're workers of iniquity and I never knew you so it's speaking to both here and they would see Abraham Isaac they see them and then the Jews in that day would be thrust out and they shall come from the east and from the west and from the north and from the south and shall sit down in the kingdom of God and behold they're our last which shall be first and they're our first which shall be last all right and that's verse 30 okay that's what we're gonna read to see there will be people seeking the open door right but it's at the wrong time we got to seek the door while there's time Wow God's available right now during our season of our lives amen so I want you to show that so see there's an open door where they can't get in that door will never be open right they are asking for the open door but that door shut where they can't have an open door but we can have the open door today amen now let me show you the dispensational open door that's acts 14 27 let's read that so this is the dispensational open door where the RAM calls us the open door of Pentecost in the church age book X 14 27 Jesus is the door Jesus is the word ax 1427 amen this has returned to Antioch they had their Paul had his first missionary trip I believe yeah and then he comes back in verse 27 and when they were come and had gathered the church together they rehearsed all that God had done with them and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles and there they abode long time with the Gentiles the Gentiles have this dispensational open door well once it's closed they're gonna say open that door back up to us and Jesus said I never knew you you already had the chance you were in the streets we were all you were in my presence all these things but you never went through the word I'm glad I can be washed through the waters of the word amen I want to be washed right now praise God hallelujah want to go through Christ the word right now and then remember we read this but the Philadelphia age was the missionary age of the open door we'll look at that more on Wednesday the missionary age of the open door and so the times of the Gentiles is the dispensational age of the open door you have a church age open door age to the Philadelphia but then you have this we'd say 2,000 long year or 2,000 years long open door to all the Gentiles okay so we have to keep that in mind there's multiple kinds of open doors by God's grace now I want to show you this here the local ministries were also open doors that's what I feel like we have an Akron God give us an open door in Akron there's an open door in Lima there's an open door in all these cities thank God for it amen that's oh we want we want an open door praise God we want something to walk into a ministry to walk into it because the Bible says if you have a gift it'll make room for itself well how do you get into a room you got to go through the door praise God now 1st Corinthians 16:9 let's go there this is this is just really refreshing to go through these 1st Corinthians 16:9 really encouraging by the grace of Lord as well within 16:9 I was asking that woman at Giant Eagle Rochelle last week I said what did you make it to church and she said no I said well here's my card she's oh I got your card she said I work since 8:00 a.m. this morning didn't make it to church and she said I said we listen to our sermon tonight when you get home she said I'll try to do that and so I asked her today if she got a chance she said no I try but then something came up she said I would try to finish listen to your sermon what am I trying to I'm trying to get her into the open door right everybody we come in contact with we try to get them into the open door by God's grace and that was just encouraging you know she's trying to listen but then things keep coming up she's trying to hear the word of God and we know right that even this ministry God can use life's true means to save souls we know that God can use YouTube to save souls God can use a track to save a soul die can use anything to save a soul it's the way that he plans amens his design a 1st Corinthians 16:9 now I want to reverse 8 though but I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost for a great door and effectual is open unto me and there are many adversaries think about that he wanted to go up to pen and coffee one to stay at Ephesus then go to Pentecost she went to stay there in Ephesus because it was a great open door right when to go to Pentecost to worship because there was an open door there's a church in Jerusalem but that's one thing I want to lay in the verse 9 we should expect if God give us an open door we should expect Satan to be fighting us tooth and nail that's what I find right we labor pray for souls we we pull them in we baptize as many as we can and then Satan pulls many of them out but we've got to still be faithful and remember we have many adversaries but with Christ were more than a conqueror and we understand we're part of those that are going through that open door as well we're trying to get as many as we can but we will face many adversaries with the open door God has given to us now one is look at verse 10 - now if Timothy has come see that he may be with you without fear for he worketh for the Lord as I do I'm sorry as I also do pardon me forgive me if I don't read the scripture right last week I kind of messed up sister Connie because I I was reading the scripture about fear and I said reverence cuz that was the definition of fear she thought I was reading the Bible and and thought that her Bible had a misprint in it so just because I you know forcefully said it so much and so forgive me I don't want to add to the word you know I need to state if I'm I need to tell you if I'm giving a definition okay but Timothy I want to make sure I wrote that I noted that Timothy was called Paul's son did you know that Paul called Timothy his son in the faith I want to just make sure I read that too because that'll become important here as we get to the next scripture so let's go to 2nd Corinthians 2 right now let's go there yeah that's right that's right so 2nd Corinthians chapter 2 verse 12 I'm gonna look at this here cuz I thought he called Titus my son to have to look up that but I thought he said Titus was my son I know he called Timothy my son they called own Onesimus his son as well as we know he was a father in the gospel he was one that brought the gospel they got born again under his ministry so they called him a father so brother Brooks would be like the father and the gospel to me because I was born again the Holy Ghost under his ministry that's just how it would be that's apostolic so 2nd Corinthians 2:12 I'm sorry I'm not there st. Corinthians 2:12 okay furthermore when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel and the door was open unto me of the Lord so he this is the local ministry open door remember he already said in acts 14 the door face been open to the Gentiles but there was also many door little doors in every city right where there's a church God had a little door got to open that door but he had to have somebody willing to go and open that door and willing to walk into that ministry then he'd raise up when the door was open they could walk through it and they could establish pastors right teachers establish a church there so this is the local ministry open door now in acts 16 Paul went to Troas which was a coastal city in the northern part of the Providence of Asia and Paul went there after the riot and Ephesus in acts 19 on his way to Macedonia in Acts chapter 20 okay so I want to UM I want to read that in just a moment but let's read the next verses since we're in sin card the interested one let's i'm sorry ii needs to let's read verse 13 here i had no rest in my spirit because I found that Titus my brother but taking my leave of them I went from thence into Macedonia so there was something about his relationship with Titus that Paul couldn't rest he had to know that his son was okay he had to know that his son was still walk you in the faith see how important it is when you have someone you've led to the Lord see how see how much you should care about them see how much we should care about the souls that God gives us he places you know these souls under us where we're supposed to be faithful we should care so much that we can't rest until we know that the ones that we've led to the Lord are still serving the Lord amen that's a real care he couldn't he couldn't have any rest he couldn't get any any consolation until he found Titus his brother that was because God had opened the door now let's go to Acts chapter 20 so I think I put that up there yeah Acts chapter 20 verse 6 so you'll remember Acts chapter 20 so an open door was given to Paul intro ass and God did a mighty miracle intro ass as well amen verse 1 and after the uproar was ceased Paul called unto him the disciples and embraced them and departed for to go into Macedonia and when he had gone over those parts and had given them much exhortation he came into Greece and their abode three months and when the Jews had laid wait for him as he was about to say on to Syria he purposed to return through Macedonia and there accompanied him into Asia so patter of Berea and of the Thessalonians r s darkest and secundus and Gaius of Derby and timotheus and of Asia Takai 'kiss and trophimus these going before tarried for us at Troas yes there's that City remember this was an open door the city was a place where God had opened a door and we sailed away from Philippi after the days of the unleavened bread and came unto them to trow as in five days where we abode seven days and upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread and that's the scripture where we get we should gather on Sunday the first day of the week they broke bread like we broke bread this morning on the first day of the week amen Paul preached unto them ready to depart on the morrow and continued his speech until midnight that's quite a long Majan if I preached here till midnight tonight that's what he did he was on the first day of the week and he preached them to midnight because we they didn't know if they'd see this messenger again they didn't know if they'd see this prophet again all they knew is that God had opened a door and Troas and they were ready to hear the message of the hour and when the Prophet came through all that's here we gonna stay all night if he's gotta leave tomorrow let's have him preach to us all night we're hungry for the Word of God we want to hear the message from the prophet of God Oh hallelujah and now you remember the miracle verse 8 and there were many lights in the upper chamber when they were gathered together and there sat in a window a certain young man named eutychus being fallen into deep sleep and as Paul was long preaching he sunk down with sleep so don't know about he's sunk down was sleep here tonight and fell down from the third Lofton was taken up dead and Paul went down and fell on him and embracing him said trouble not yourselves for his life is in him wherefore he therefore was come up again and when he had broken bread and eaten and talked a long while until break of day so he departed and they brought the young man alive and were not a little comforted a man praise God now I want to just stay a couple more things about this there's a few things I read in here now that'll be a blessing I want to read that scripture how Paul was the son I'm sorry Timothy was a son to Paul okay so it's go to 2nd Timothy 1 verse 2 second Timothy 1 verse 2 second timothy 1 verse 2 alright someone like to read that for me second Timothy Lydia thank you [Music] amen so these men that were under Paul became sons to him let me find Titus and see if there's there it is alright Titus 1 for I knew I thought for sure Titus was a son of Paul 2 so it's going to Titus 1 for I just want to show you the relationship you know through the scripture that the open door brings the open door brings father-son relations in other words it brings family relationship right when someone's born again through the ministry it brings like a family relationship like father son mother right it brings that Kuip type of family where our family here at church should be more close than your unsaved family that's your natural blood family ever understand that by God's grace Paul and Timothy Paul was like father Timothy's son Paul's father Titus is son it brings such a strong bond because it's the bond of eternal life amen through the open door alright Titus 1 for malachite give me that for me sir thank you amen so Titus was his son a member there in second Corinthians there he said Titus was my son and Titus I had no rest until I found Titus my son through the open door now Titus is important to this is a thought that's kind of outside the the open door thought but I want to lay this in here Titus was Paul's proof to the Galatians that the Gentiles could be converted without works of the law such as circumcision so I like the let's go to Galatians chapter 2 Galatians 2 verse 1 [Music] because we know that's the proof of a real Ministry of God is that the ministry produces god-given fruit which are souls souls believers those who have accepted it that's the fruit of the ministry praise God amen so Galatians 2 verse 1 then 14 years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas and took Titus with me also I went up by revelation all right there's that thought from this morning amen and communicated unto them that gospel which I preached among the Gentiles but privately to them which were of reputation lest by any means I should run or had run in vain but neither Titus who was with me being a greek was compelled to be circumcised and that because of false brethren unawares brought in who came in private to spy out our Liberty which we have in Christ Jesus that they might bring us into bondage to whom we gave place by subjection no not for an hour that the truth of the gospel might continue with you praise God so Paul had Timothy right here he had a Gentile right here amongst those Jews and said look at this Gentile look how he's so filled with faith look how he's so filled with power in other words he's gone through the open door he don't need to go through the law he needs he went through the open door he went through the baptism of the holy ghost and now he's my son so who were Paul's most faithful converts the Gentiles and yet he was a Jew because God had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles and he was the messenger to the Gentiles amen Titus was also an effective as Paul's ambassador and dealing with the Corinthian crisis and then later he represented the Christians represented the Apostle Paul to the Christians in Crete which was Titus 1:4 so Titus was in the city of Crete amen okay so I like that by God's grace I want to see that Paul's the father and he had these two sons in the gospel that came through the open door amen all right now let's finish up here I got a couple more scriptures I want to finish up on these by the grace of Lord okay so go to Colossians chapter 4 here Colossians 4 verse 1 so I hope you can see tonight that's my goal for you can see the open door through the scripture and the different applications right you have the dispensation open door you have the six church age open door we have the open door that we must go through our local ministry and here's now what we can pray for as well in Colossians 4 we must pray for more open doors that's what we can do tonight as we close in a few moments can pray for open doors how many once the open door and their family how about an open door in a different City I like to see an open door in Doylestown you know I Drive through this might be something you but I drive through every town and when I Drive through these towns I see like storefront places that say for rent I just envisioned churches there I don't know about you but that's like I want to see it open I want to see a revival in Doylestown where I want to see a revival wodsworth other why couldn't just a little Church you know like a little message churches that's that's my desire I want to see open doors so we got to pray for open doors I got to keep praying for open doors this is what Paul said you must print we must pray for these so a Colossians 4 masters gay to your servants that which is just and equal knowing that ye also have a master in heaven now here's gets into the new thought now he transitions continue in prayer and watch in the same with Thanksgiving with all praying also for us or pray for the Apostles pray for Paul and all the Apostles that God would open unto us a door of utterance to speak the mystery of Christ for which I am also in bonds that I may make it manifest as I ought to speak in that beautiful he says I'm in jail right now but you need to pray that God will open up a door of utterance that I can share the mystery of Christ with other people in other places I thought you don't let you to appreciate that by God's grace we must pray for open doors and like I said that's what we'll do tonight here in just a moment let's read this last verse then revelation 3:20 and this is the age for us every person that gets to hear the message of the hour by the Holy Spirit is actually hearing the Holy Spirit cry out to them open the door to me that's what that's what happens when they get to hear about water baptism they got to hear about serpent seed when they get to hear about a prophet in this hour in Revelation 10 7 they're actually hearing the Holy Spirit say open the door I'm knocking will you let me in will you fellowship with me will you have communion with me praise God for the open door amen I love that revelation 3:20 behold I stand at the door and knock and If any man hear my voice and open the door because we have the door to the heart I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me 10 that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit says into the churches praise God let's turn our feet here we'll close with that one by God's grace so I'm going back to this err summary there's open door to the Philadelphia there's the open door of the Gentile dispensation of Prophet said the Pentecost that's what Adrienne right now there's open doors the local ministries there's open doors to heaven by vision there's open doors that Christ is asking for today but the most of Gentiles they're gonna ask for the open door too late they're gonna ask for the word of the hour the Holy Ghost they're gonna ask for that too late because it's being offered right now by God's grace how many appreciate that little study there by God's grace oh I love going to the scripture and looking at open doors and doors off in the New Testament it's there for us we've got to be faithful amen help me have it on their heart that God would open the door somewhere I constantly wonder I want to witness to somebody I want to want to see churches and little cities all over here I'd love to see that but something we have to pray for as Paul said pray for us that God would give us a door letters yeah I look at it to you I looked at Akron God gave me the door of utterance with the long church for a couple years I don't know if you remember where you hear anyone we they invited me to preach at their church two or three times that youth event three times I felt like God was offering them the open door and thank God you know the banks family came out you know then whoever the Amen so thank God for that we've got offer them the open door and I want to see more opportunities don't you want to see more open doors I can imagine if maybe the cost of church or Apostolic Church or Baptist Church in this area we just want to see God open doors so we can speak the mystery you know that reminds me this morning brother Jose wasn't here this morning do you tell you what okay he thought you I okay did you know okay sister guys I'll try to summarize a real quick he got a text from Simon or he thought it was signing my brother but it was a different Simon and Simon said we're gonna have a big service at this location we can you join us in Akron so he went expecting to see my brother and all of us there and it wasn't but they let him come up and testified he said he got to share about the message of the hour he got to share our YouTube channel with his testimony on it and there was I guess a hundred people there or someone that they really liked his testimony so he may go back there in the summer but that was strange on the name of reaching an open door obviously I got an open door there to share his testimony about the messages of the hour and how God's open those things to him so we'll just see we'll see we'll see if God will open a door one thing let's pray for let's pray for an open door praise God and that souls will open their hearts door to Christ so as we pray you know it's just our heads and think of someone you want to pray for or think of a city think of a town you want to see God give you a door of utterance let's just pray for these as we close here how many father we love you Lord God well thankful for this word tonight we'll count this word is written upon our hearts Lord God when I hear and read that Paul said pray for me and I'll get out of this jail is prison and I'll have an open door of utterance and give you boldness prayed out boldness to speak the mystery of Christ it makes us tonight when I pray for open doors but I pray for an open door lord if it be your will in Doylestown in wodsworth in the Cleveland area Laurel maybe the east side of Cleveland or New Philadelphia there's no less than churches in these areas Lord God would stir the hoses and tons of souls dear God and maybe never heard the message in Lord I pray God you'd open up a door of utterance for me for all the preachers of the message door that this gospel can go where it's never been preached before Lord open doors of utterance more that to the end that more Souls might open their hearts door in
