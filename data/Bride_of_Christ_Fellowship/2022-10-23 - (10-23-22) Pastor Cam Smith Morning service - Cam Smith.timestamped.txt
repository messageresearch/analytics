[0:02] God bless Saints amen I'll take that as
[0:04] a confirmation on where we're going this
[0:06] morning thank you brother
[0:08] and we pray that the Holy Ghost would be
[0:10] on our brothers he as he brings the
[0:12] church in worship the Holy Ghost is on
[0:14] you as well as Believers amen God bless
[0:16] each and every one of your precious uh
[0:18] saints of God there and hope it's okay
[0:21] but it sounds like uh you know I'm I'm
[0:23] here because uh you know brother brother
[0:26] William had it on his heart he's like
[0:27] man I'd like to hear Brother cam again
[0:29] so you know I I told some of the Saints
[0:32] yesterday I had a little fellowship and
[0:34] I said you know you really can't pay a a
[0:37] preacher any better of a compliment than
[0:39] that amen that they're able to get
[0:40] yielded to the Lord so with that brother
[0:42] we love you and we appreciate that and
[0:44] uh there's only one surprise I I'm not
[0:47] really excited about and that's uh that
[0:48] really Jesse and his family ain't here
[0:51] but uh you know we we have some real
[0:55] like-minded brothers and sisters in
[0:57] Christ here and we I don't know about
[0:59] you it won't be long we see we see it so
[1:03] close now that we'll be gathered not
[1:06] just in Heavenly places as we come to
[1:07] this Rapture but we will be gathered to
[1:09] that Heavenly Place amen and that's what
[1:12] we're looking for
[1:13] um and uh if there's anything I could
[1:15] say or do that would benefit you this
[1:18] morning it would it would just have to
[1:20] be something of the Lord in order to
[1:24] excuse me here I'm gonna do a PowerPoint
[1:26] this morning if we can get prepped up
[1:28] for that
[1:29] um but uh
[1:31] to just encourage you and show you how
[1:33] much God loves you and show you how much
[1:35] you love God Amen I think sometimes
[1:37] we're not fully conscious uh or maybe it
[1:40] becomes a little challenge uh how the
[1:42] devil would fight us and our lifestyles
[1:44] and our days and and he he wants you to
[1:48] feel like you have to fit some cookie
[1:50] cutter thing where you're this Mister or
[1:52] Miss Perfect Mrs perfect and and you
[1:55] know the love of God goes so far beyond
[1:57] that amen you know God loves us with a
[2:00] love that uh literally it cannot be it
[2:03] cannot be grasped by the human mind amen
[2:06] and uh that is a beautiful thing because
[2:09] uh that really takes you out of the
[2:11] picture amen now you can see what God
[2:13] has really done is he's what brought us
[2:16] to the place to see election and
[2:18] predestination amen and uh although you
[2:21] don't feel like you're what you're
[2:23] supposed to be
[2:24] God himself cannot see you any different
[2:28] than what he's seen you when he placed
[2:30] your name on that book amen when your
[2:33] name was placed on that book God forever
[2:35] settled it in his mind and in his sight
[2:37] what you would be for him amen oh my God
[2:42] hallelujah oh Amazing Grace How Sweet
[2:45] the Sound amen
[2:48] amen let's get hooked up let's get right
[2:50] into the word of God this morning why
[2:51] don't we and uh
[2:54] we're just going to bring a little
[2:55] thought to you we know the Lord will
[2:57] help we know he's here and uh
[3:00] there's so many different directions
[3:02] that we could go but yet this is what's
[3:05] on our heart this morning from the Lord
[3:08] and this gets me stirred up when I when
[3:10] I when I preach uh certain things I just
[3:13] get so stirred up in the Lord because uh
[3:16] you know this Bible is is not just the
[3:19] revelation of Jesus Christ it is but
[3:23] it's also the revelation of what you are
[3:27] to him
[3:28] because remember as brother Branham said
[3:31] that each one of you are holding a part
[3:34] of God
[3:35] so how could Christ ever deny you when
[3:38] you're part of him
[3:41] oh my we Rejoice uh here it is uh we
[3:45] could call it the first commandment uh
[3:47] we could call it something that we just
[3:51] so earnestly live by uh you know putting
[3:54] God first in our hearts and lives amen
[3:56] Deuteronomy 6 4
[3:58] it says here it says uh hear o Israel
[4:01] the Lord our God is one Lord amen he's
[4:06] one he's not three persons he's he has
[4:08] one A one-person God and Jesus Christ is
[4:11] what the fullness of the godhead bodily
[4:14] amen it's what you see amen and thou
[4:17] shalt love the Lord thy God with all
[4:20] thine heart
[4:21] how much of your heart does he want all
[4:24] of it amen and with all thy soul and
[4:29] with all thy might
[4:30] and these words which I command thee
[4:33] this day
[4:34] shall be in thy heart thine heart and
[4:39] thou shalt teach them diligently unto
[4:41] thy children and shall talk of them when
[4:44] thou sit us in thine house and when thou
[4:47] walkest by the way and when I thou lie
[4:50] us down and when thou Rises up now that
[4:53] right there is God's will to his church
[4:58] that's something though isn't it
[5:00] so
[5:02] as Christians we have a responsibility
[5:07] that we teach the word diligently to our
[5:10] children
[5:12] but notice it says and we shall talk of
[5:15] it when we're in this in the when uh
[5:17] when we sit us in the house when you're
[5:19] walking by the way when thou lie is down
[5:21] when thou rise is up God really desires
[5:25] us to be constantly fixed on him
[5:29] that is the love of Jesus Christ amen
[5:31] I've kind of been taken to church at
[5:34] home over maybe a little bit of uh a
[5:37] little bit of a push and trying to show
[5:39] them that you know what you know what
[5:41] joins us here more than anything else
[5:42] it's not good just good looks brother
[5:45] sister we're good-looking people right
[5:48] we're hard workers we love each other
[5:50] amen but what joins us more than
[5:53] anything else is our love for Jesus
[5:56] Christ Our Love for the word amen that
[5:59] we can what speak of the word amen know
[6:02] of the word understand the word and be
[6:05] yielded to the word so even to that
[6:07] point the word can be revealed through
[6:09] us
[6:10] amen
[6:11] amen hallelujah one more place we're
[6:14] going to take a little turn this morning
[6:16] well it's kind of a deep little simple
[6:18] thing we got going on here but we just
[6:20] trust it'll be a blessing to you Song of
[6:22] Solomon 8 verse 6.
[6:25] Song of Solomon
[6:27] 8 verse 6. I know years ago if I
[6:31] remember right brother Jesse had
[6:32] preached a series on the book of Song of
[6:34] Solomon and today we're going to take a
[6:37] little bit of a turn into that and we're
[6:39] you know how we like to do it I I just
[6:41] uh I like to go right through the word
[6:43] of God and prove that this message is
[6:45] absolutely 100 percent the word and will
[6:48] of God Amen
[6:50] you know doubters and and people who
[6:53] would scoff and leave this message and
[6:55] so forth let them be what they are but
[6:56] there is evidence plenty of it that this
[6:59] is right
[7:01] and we might as well just hold the
[7:03] course and election will take its place
[7:05] in our lives amen hallelujah
[7:09] Song of Solomon 8 6 and some very very
[7:12] interesting words here
[7:14] it says set me
[7:17] as a seal
[7:20] upon thine heart
[7:23] as a seal upon thine arm
[7:28] for love
[7:29] is strong
[7:31] as death look how strong love is
[7:35] strong as death people people die for
[7:37] love right there's no greater love than
[7:39] this that a man would lay his life down
[7:41] for his friends and that's what Jesus
[7:43] Christ did right jealousy is cruel as
[7:46] the grave
[7:48] the coals thereof are coals of Fire
[7:53] which hath a most vehement
[7:56] Flame
[7:57] look at that there it is talking about
[8:01] a seal upon a heart
[8:03] hallelujah we're going to say a word of
[8:05] prayer I will pray greetings from the
[8:07] Saints from Living Waters and we'll say
[8:10] a prayer for them at home for the Simon
[8:12] is ministering there brother Jesse is
[8:14] ministering in Albion and we have been
[8:17] fortunate to be here this morning and
[8:19] we'll just say a prayer that the Lord
[8:20] will have his way now won't we let's
[8:22] just bow our heads forward of prayer
[8:23] Lord Jesus we come before you right now
[8:27] Lord
[8:28] and oh God from the inside how much we
[8:31] love you Lord
[8:32] we want to fulfill those scriptures oh
[8:35] God that the word is constantly in our
[8:37] mind meditating on it oh God that we're
[8:41] talking about it Lord because
[8:44] within the words coming from our mouth
[8:48] is wisdom and Grace can be given to the
[8:51] hearer strength can be given to the hero
[8:54] God your Bible said that what is as is a
[8:56] well of life that these words we could
[8:58] speak are or as a tree of life also it
[9:01] says in the Book of Proverbs Lord but
[9:05] we're asking this morning as we have
[9:07] come all of us dedicated to our love
[9:11] towards you Lord that you would come in
[9:15] a way this morning to meet our needs oh
[9:17] God that your anointing would come Lord
[9:19] your strength would come Lord and you'd
[9:22] be able God to bring us Revelation to
[9:25] draw us more closer to thee Lord that's
[9:27] what we want to be we want to be at a
[9:29] spot when this Rapture hits oh God that
[9:33] Lord there won't be a big change Lord
[9:35] we're so close to you Lord that's what
[9:38] we want we want to be so joined in heart
[9:40] and mind kind and soul to you Lord that
[9:42] Lord we're we're ready to go oh God
[9:44] every day ready to go so Lord we're just
[9:46] praying that you just bless this time
[9:48] that we have with one another uh blessed
[9:50] brother Jesse as he ministers and Albion
[9:52] bless uh the words that will come forth
[9:54] from his mouth as well as brother Simons
[9:55] at home Lord uh and allow all these
[9:58] words oh God to get your bride ready for
[10:02] thee Lord your scripture says in
[10:04] Ephesians 4 that what that that fivefold
[10:07] was given for the perfecting of the
[10:08] Saints oh God not those men or those
[10:11] individuals but oh God the word that is
[10:14] coming from them Lord so find o God
[10:16] within your heart today to bring the
[10:19] word oh God to bring a Perfection that
[10:21] is saints of God that they might be able
[10:23] to work harder and push more for you
[10:26] than ever before Oh God in a constant
[10:29] Revival as our Prophet said oh God we
[10:31] must be in a spot that we never let the
[10:34] spirit of Revival die in our lives may
[10:36] it be found today o God in the loving
[10:38] precious name of Jesus Christ we love
[10:40] you thank you and worship you now as we
[10:43] say Amen so be it amen you may have your
[10:46] seats
[10:48] I always come brother sister and uh it
[10:51] seems like the Lord's always doing
[10:52] something so I I like to encourage you
[10:54] you know when I come and uh just
[10:56] recently I uh it's probably a couple
[10:59] months ago now it might have been right
[11:00] after I I was here last but uh you know
[11:03] we had uh we have a new brother that's
[11:05] coming to church and and uh anyway he uh
[11:09] he had given me a call
[11:11] and he he had said he said uh I haven't
[11:16] told nobody about this yet he said but I
[11:18] I want to tell you about something that
[11:19] happened the other day in church and I'm
[11:21] like all right he's like I and he kind
[11:23] of you know he's kind of really kind of
[11:24] nervy and he said I uh I'm a little bit
[11:27] nervous to tell you this because I I
[11:28] don't want you to think I'm crazy
[11:30] and I said oh all right all right that's
[11:32] fine that's fine and uh he goes he goes
[11:36] the other day he said he said we all
[11:38] bowed her head when you were praying uh
[11:41] getting ready to minister and he said he
[11:44] said and when you said amen he said I
[11:47] looked up
[11:49] and he said you're probably going to
[11:52] think this crazy so this is a new
[11:53] believer you don't know much about the
[11:54] word of God he said and when I lifted my
[11:58] head up he said I seen a cloud up at the
[12:02] pulpit all around
[12:05] he said do you think that's crazy
[12:08] [Laughter]
[12:10] I said I'll tell you what it is it was
[12:14] the Shekinah Glory and God was opening
[12:18] your eyes to it being in our presence
[12:21] [Laughter]
[12:23] Hallelujah I said you might not know
[12:26] this and he didn't
[12:27] I said that holies of holies uh when
[12:32] that high priest would enter the holies
[12:34] of holies there there would be the
[12:37] Shekinah Glory a cloud or a miss that
[12:40] was above that Mercy Seat hold on
[12:43] Hallelujah and God said I will meet you
[12:47] there amen and you know by the scripture
[12:50] and by this message that's exactly where
[12:54] God is leading us amen he is what two
[12:59] thousand years ago he rent The Veil from
[13:01] top to bottom Amen to show that there
[13:04] are no longer was a separation from man
[13:08] from The Holy place to the holies of
[13:11] holies amen and but what it was now our
[13:14] responsibility to enter in and meet with
[13:18] him there amen hallelujah where the word
[13:21] was amen where Aaron's Rod was where
[13:24] that hidden manner was amen God has
[13:27] invited us in uh we are called to be
[13:30] partakers so let us be mindful of the
[13:33] Heavenly place that we sit in this
[13:35] morning amen you might not feel him you
[13:38] might not see him amen but the scripture
[13:41] promises that he is here amen hallelujah
[13:45] if he is here it don't matter if I'm
[13:47] here it doesn't matter if any one of us
[13:49] are here but what we bring to the table
[13:52] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost with
[13:55] once again enforces that God is in our
[13:58] midst amen
[13:59] Hallelujah
[14:01] so we can set our affection to things
[14:04] above we can look and expect uh and
[14:07] expect uh Tennessee uh that Christ is
[14:10] going to do something in our midst amen
[14:13] now we want to bring a little idea this
[14:17] morning
[14:18] it travels through the scripture so get
[14:20] ready that's kind of how we do things I
[14:23] can only preach what God opens my eyes
[14:25] to so I try to be very mindful of that
[14:28] but I know this I just long for the word
[14:32] to be open to me I long for that I long
[14:36] for Revelation this message brings us to
[14:39] Revelation that cannot be attained
[14:40] anywhere else amen and just the
[14:43] invitation from Christ himself to put us
[14:46] in a spot to receive it oh it speaks
[14:49] volumes amen remember your Prophet said
[14:52] that when you recognize that this
[14:55] message was Eagle food you actually
[14:58] heard from your theophany amen you heard
[15:01] from that what that Glory that Eternal
[15:05] essence of God known as your theophany
[15:08] amen
[15:09] you have a word body you've done heard
[15:12] from it it shows that what there's no
[15:14] fear or scare in this
[15:16] hallelujah how many times did Brother
[15:18] Branham say if we could just get away
[15:21] from the fear and scare he said you
[15:23] don't know who you are so what if we do
[15:27] know who we are then what God can do or
[15:30] what he can do things in this assembly
[15:33] that is so beyond our imagination right
[15:37] the scripture says he's able to do above
[15:40] all that we ask or sing amen God is
[15:44] wanting to do things that you can't even
[15:46] think it
[15:48] Hallelujah but in his time he will
[15:51] Manifest this love to you as you draw
[15:54] near to him amen
[15:56] Hallelujah so it took us a few minutes
[15:58] to get here but this morning we're going
[16:01] to minister on this idea
[16:04] the seal
[16:06] on Christ's heart
[16:09] the seal on Christ's heart now we know
[16:14] even as last time we spent a little bit
[16:16] of time working with a Signet
[16:18] but we know that God has sealed you
[16:22] he's placed a seal on your life amen now
[16:27] remember that is by the baptism of the
[16:29] Holy Ghost in Ephesians 1 13 it says in
[16:33] whom he also trusted we've got to trust
[16:35] God amen hallelujah it's coming don't
[16:39] worry hold on it's what it's right on
[16:42] time amen remember not one thing is out
[16:45] of cater with God hallelujah he's got
[16:48] you right where he wants you this
[16:51] morning but yet with the word he's
[16:53] trying to get a greater amen out here
[16:55] amen he's trying to get one more life
[16:58] out of you and his words are life amen
[17:01] they are spirit and they are our life
[17:04] amen
[17:06] watch this in whom he also trusted after
[17:09] that ye heard the word of Truth The
[17:11] Gospel of your salvation you heard the
[17:14] word of Truth
[17:16] in whom also after that ye believed ye
[17:20] were sealed with that Holy Spirit of
[17:24] Promise which is the earnest of our
[17:26] inheritance until the Redemption of the
[17:29] purchased possession unto the praise of
[17:32] his glory amen so what
[17:36] God brought it so you would hear the
[17:39] truth
[17:41] so that he knew you would receive the
[17:44] truth
[17:45] and in receiving the truth he knew you
[17:48] would believe it so he could fill you
[17:51] with the Holy Ghost amen which was the
[17:54] down payment of your inheritance your
[17:57] Eternal inheritance
[18:00] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is just a
[18:02] down payment amen
[18:03] [Laughter]
[18:05] Hallelujah remember uh this uh in in the
[18:09] adoption message brother Branham said he
[18:12] said the first thing that God gave you
[18:14] was your inheritance
[18:15] [Laughter]
[18:17] hallelujah amen and what now you are
[18:21] showing that you are a partaker of that
[18:24] inheritance by the baptism of the Holy
[18:26] Ghost and you cannot get away from this
[18:29] word amen
[18:31] amen until what unto the praise of his
[18:36] glory amen hallelujah your life is
[18:41] glorification to God
[18:44] Hallelujah don't expect God to do all of
[18:47] it right sometimes we expect God to
[18:49] convert Every Soul as far as to go out
[18:51] and and do this and do that but that's
[18:53] actually why he moved into the Son of
[18:57] God ministration from the Son of Man
[18:59] because he wanted to do it inside of you
[19:02] amen so you could see that you and
[19:06] Christ are together joined as one amen
[19:09] these twain shall be in one flesh amen
[19:13] and you can manifest his life to this
[19:16] world Amen now let me get moving I got a
[19:18] lot to say here
[19:20] so we found that what
[19:23] just like that seal he sealed you with
[19:26] there is a book in the right hand of God
[19:29] what the sealed book it has seals on it
[19:33] remember
[19:35] what are those to do
[19:36] it's to seal the contents in
[19:40] Hallelujah now remember that seal it
[19:44] represents a finished work
[19:47] that seal speaks of ownership
[19:50] and that seal speaks of security
[19:54] now think about that it was royalty's
[19:57] decree with a seal
[19:59] Hallelujah is generally the wealthy are
[20:01] those of power and they would have a
[20:03] seal
[20:04] and whatever they were sealing and
[20:07] nobody could touch it
[20:09] until it arrived at its destination
[20:12] you see if you've been sealed with the
[20:15] Holy Ghost nothing can touch you until
[20:18] you arrive at your destination
[20:22] amen he didn't say the finished product
[20:24] was when you received the Holy Ghost and
[20:26] you're absolutely 100 perfect that
[20:29] wasn't what it is amen hallelujah the
[20:32] only way you could ever be perfect is by
[20:35] the shed blood of Jesus Christ amen
[20:38] hallelujah because when he looks at you
[20:41] he has to look through his blood amen
[20:43] and then he looks at you and says I find
[20:45] no fault amen
[20:47] hallelujah amen so it shows you our
[20:51] finished work it shows his ownership
[20:53] over you and it shows what a security
[20:56] that you have in him
[20:58] but watch this
[21:00] we're going to do a big turn on this
[21:02] right now all right
[21:04] because that sounds really good these
[21:05] opening of the seals and so forth
[21:08] but now watch when we go into
[21:11] the most romantic book
[21:13] of the Bible
[21:16] watch when we go
[21:19] to the book in the Bible
[21:21] that gives us
[21:23] a red hot fire relationship
[21:27] between King Solomon and the shulamite
[21:32] now watch this I charge you o Daughters
[21:36] of Jerusalem
[21:37] they stir not up nor awake my love
[21:41] until he please
[21:45] Hallelujah so this is what the shulamite
[21:49] speaking here
[21:51] and she's saying don't you touch my
[21:53] beloved until he awakes when he wants to
[21:57] she's trying to keep everyone in
[21:59] accordance to his will right now watch
[22:01] us who is this that cometh up from the
[22:05] wilderness
[22:06] leaning
[22:09] upon her
[22:10] beloved
[22:12] ah
[22:14] notice I have that underline keep that
[22:16] in the back of your mind okay
[22:18] leaning upon her beloved
[22:24] I raise thee Up Under The Apple Tree
[22:27] there thy mother brought thee forth
[22:30] there she brought thee forth that bear
[22:33] thee
[22:35] and then he we move into the next part
[22:37] of this now watch
[22:40] there it is leaning upon her beloved
[22:44] right upon him
[22:46] she says notice how I said that she says
[22:52] set me as a seal
[22:55] upon thine heart
[22:59] what kind of deep terminology is going
[23:01] on here
[23:04] I'm sure it means something
[23:07] as a seal
[23:11] for love is strong
[23:14] as strawlessly as cruel as the grave the
[23:17] calls thereof are coals of fire which
[23:20] have a most vehement Flame
[23:24] many Waters cannot quench love
[23:27] neither can the floods drown it if a man
[23:32] would give all the substance of his
[23:34] house for love it would be utterly
[23:37] contempt or condemned
[23:40] all right
[23:42] there she is leaning upon her beloved
[23:48] and she has a moment of inspiration
[23:52] she has
[23:53] and she says setting me as a seal upon
[23:59] your heart
[24:02] the sealer
[24:05] is wanting
[24:07] amen let me say this right the one who
[24:11] seals has another
[24:14] that is calling for him to make her a
[24:18] seal upon him
[24:21] this is this is deep now this is good
[24:22] stuff here it's gonna be good all right
[24:24] Hallelujah because because what is this
[24:27] all about
[24:28] this is all about A Love Affair that
[24:32] this woman has for King Solomon King
[24:36] Solomon obviously a type of Christ the
[24:40] shulamite obviously a type of the bride
[24:43] of Christ
[24:47] she calls to him
[24:50] and says putting me as a seal upon your
[24:54] heart and upon your arm
[24:57] and then she explains why
[25:00] love
[25:02] is strong as death
[25:04] ah
[25:07] she wanted to be his only
[25:11] she wanted to be seen
[25:14] the one that mattered most to him
[25:19] I'm showing you your position
[25:23] jealousy is cruel as the grave you see
[25:27] as the prophet said there's a lot of
[25:30] brides as far as there's a lot of
[25:31] churches out there
[25:33] but there's only one bride of Jesus
[25:36] Christ
[25:38] Hallelujah we do not set ourselves down
[25:41] to a concubine level
[25:43] we do not set ourselves down and say
[25:46] well I guess we'll just be like the rest
[25:50] but notice the Cry of the heart of this
[25:53] Shula my woman
[25:55] she wanted to be set as a seal upon his
[25:59] heart
[26:01] when people now think about this
[26:04] so when people saw King Solomon
[26:09] she said let them see me
[26:16] why because she loved him that much
[26:20] [Laughter]
[26:22] you know what being the bride is you
[26:25] love him that much amen when the
[26:29] scripture says with all your heart amen
[26:31] oh God with all our heart we love thee
[26:35] amen
[26:36] Hallelujah now that's from that's not
[26:39] hey that's bride of Christ Fellowship
[26:42] you that's this is an individual Affair
[26:45] brother sister we're inviting all come
[26:47] in amen but it is up to every single one
[26:51] why because the Bible says every joint
[26:53] supplies
[26:56] it's up for you with your love to be
[26:58] part of that body
[26:59] amen
[27:02] you mean a bride would cry out
[27:05] remember your prophet and the church age
[27:08] brother Branham said that what he said
[27:11] that a first love experience in a church
[27:12] age book he said that was what that was
[27:15] typical of a man and a woman in their
[27:18] early start of marriage the fire that
[27:20] was there
[27:21] God don't want to lukewarm our love out
[27:23] of you
[27:26] in such a way he says I'd rather you be
[27:28] cold
[27:29] or hot not lukewarm but because you're
[27:33] lukewarm I'll spew you out of my mouth
[27:36] so what do we want to be I don't know
[27:38] about you don't want to be called
[27:40] don't want to be lukewarm oh God let us
[27:43] burn with the fire of the loving God
[27:46] Amen
[27:48] Hallelujah now remember this is in the
[27:52] word for a reason
[27:55] I'm going to show you this
[27:57] all right
[27:59] so notice just as the scripture says
[28:02] here if a man would give all the
[28:03] substance of his house for love it would
[28:05] be utterly contempt
[28:07] well it'd be contemptible
[28:08] it would be that what people would
[28:10] disrespect him for that
[28:12] but when you look in the Bible Jesus
[28:15] said that what
[28:17] that when a man would find a pearl of a
[28:20] great price he would sell everything he
[28:23] had to get that Pearl
[28:26] that's what this message is you've got
[28:29] to sell all out amen and grab this pile
[28:33] of fire amen
[28:34] it's a pearl of great price this loving
[28:38] God that's called you to this Feast
[28:39] Hallelujah
[28:44] now let's move
[28:46] when you see a
[28:48] a reading I always read my commentators
[28:51] and spursion says something here is
[28:53] phenomenal
[28:54] he says the prayer you will notice
[28:57] referring to these scriptures is twofold
[29:00] although it is so really and essentially
[29:04] one
[29:06] set me as a seal upon thine heart as a
[29:10] seal upon thine arm
[29:12] now what do you say it's too full but
[29:13] it's actually one now watch us
[29:15] oh Lord let me know that my name is
[29:19] engraved on thy heart
[29:24] not only let it be there but let me know
[29:27] it
[29:29] the hand to do
[29:33] think of the inspiration on this
[29:36] shulamite
[29:38] she is saying send me as a seal on your
[29:41] heart
[29:42] oh the wild that you love me
[29:48] but she said the arm too
[29:52] Hallelujah not only
[29:54] of your affection but that you would
[29:57] prove it
[29:59] Hallelujah
[30:02] that's why Jesus said the works that I
[30:06] do shall ye do and greater shall ye do
[30:09] because I go unto my father amen he's
[30:12] wanting to show the world that you are
[30:15] the Bride of Jesus Christ amen the power
[30:18] of God did not die when brother Branham
[30:21] died it is on moving with the church
[30:23] amen and God expects us Amen to take the
[30:28] word and say yes God set me as a seal
[30:31] amen
[30:32] let everybody see that I love you amen
[30:35] let everybody see that what you're
[30:37] willing to do things for me because you
[30:39] love me
[30:41] this passionate love
[30:45] it manifests the omnipotent love that
[30:47] God has for you
[30:50] Solomon didn't hide this
[30:53] he didn't say well that's a little bit
[30:54] too deep you know because I got foolish
[30:56] virgins and I got I got those good to
[30:59] the bride I got all this and that we got
[31:01] other churches you know the big churches
[31:04] he didn't say that
[31:07] there it was that one woman how how many
[31:10] women did Solomon have
[31:13] 700 wives and 300 concubines
[31:16] a thousand he said one among a thousand
[31:18] I haven't found
[31:20] Hallelujah but here's one
[31:23] Hallelujah there's thousands of churches
[31:26] but oh God let there be found a place in
[31:29] this little assembly here amen that God
[31:32] can see our entire group
[31:35] set aside with a passion for Jesus
[31:38] Christ amen to love him to do his word
[31:42] amen to yield to him so he can manifest
[31:47] his what his heart and arm to you
[31:51] Hallelujah
[31:52] oh this is so beautiful
[31:54] let me know it
[31:57] see God don't God don't want you brother
[31:59] sister
[32:00] to go through a life and never see God
[32:02] do anything
[32:06] he wants you to cry out and say God let
[32:08] me know it
[32:11] Hallelujah
[32:14] set it upon thine arm too not just your
[32:18] heart your arm
[32:20] let the whole world see
[32:22] you see what I'm saying you know people
[32:25] fell out of the message because they see
[32:27] a lot of fallacies
[32:29] more more than with brother Branham they
[32:31] find it with the people
[32:33] that's why every time you see they're
[32:34] always what they're always really bitter
[32:36] against messaged people
[32:38] very angry
[32:41] that's not an excuse
[32:44] but I think sometimes their tail is not
[32:46] too far off
[32:48] because it becomes of us
[32:50] to live this message out
[32:53] Christ didn't give us this message I
[32:55] mean go go to uh go to messiah in in the
[32:58] Messiah messaging 61 and find out that
[33:01] what God made you an amateur God
[33:04] to display him to the world
[33:10] Hallelujah
[33:11] remember brother Branham said he said
[33:14] there was coming a time he said where
[33:15] it'll shut the mouths of the critics
[33:18] that shows that there will be critics
[33:23] but it also says that the god you serve
[33:26] will be so great in your life amen that
[33:30] it will shut their mouths amen
[33:33] Hallelujah what's your expectation yes
[33:37] the system is going down but the Bride
[33:40] of Jesus Christ is going up amen
[33:44] hallelujah we're coming to manifestation
[33:47] Time Lord
[33:50] Hallelujah
[33:53] write my name not only in thy heart but
[33:55] may it be as a Signet on the on the
[33:57] heart that I may see it
[33:59] see I want to see you love me God
[34:01] I want to say I love you Lord
[34:04] is that our prayers is how we live
[34:07] you see how I joined Deuteronomy with
[34:08] that at the beginning
[34:10] because remember he should be the
[34:11] Principal theme of our talk
[34:13] our walk our life our action our choices
[34:18] Christ is everything
[34:21] what is that that's the manifested bride
[34:23] right there
[34:25] two it says the spouse argues with her
[34:28] Lord thus it is my advantage that thou
[34:32] shouldest thus writs my name upon thine

[34:44] and that it has a sure and unquenchable
[34:47] Eternity with these four please she
[34:50] backth up
[34:52] her suit
[34:55] when's the last time
[34:57] you just sat in the presence of God and
[35:00] the love of Jesus Christ flowing upon
[35:03] you
[35:05] you could almost you could almost not
[35:07] even move in the presence

[39:33] the psalm of David when he was in the
[39:35] wilderness of Judah oh God
[39:38] Thou Art my God
[39:41] early will I seek thee my soul thirsteth
[39:45] for thee my flesh longer for thee in a
[39:48] dry and thirsty land where no water is
[39:53] you see how he's likening his condition
[39:56] to his need for God
[39:58] that's why the scripture says that man
[40:00] shall not live by bread alone
[40:03] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[40:06] the mouth of God
[40:08] we esteem his word his person greater
[40:13] than the very food we eat
[40:18] Hallelujah well show that amen
[40:22] Hallelujah
[40:23] you love God
[40:25] Hallelujah
[40:27] I'm feeling good because there's
[40:29] anointings here brother sister I hope I
[40:31] hope you're moving into it amen because
[40:33] what God wants from you is to what have
[40:36] a first love experience with you amen
[40:40] Hallelujah you realize you can't alter
[40:43] God's love for you
[40:46] now think about it the scripture says in
[40:48] first John what that God is love
[40:53] this whole person
[40:55] is known as love
[41:00] so when the devil would tell you
[41:03] that God don't love you
[41:07] or what
[41:09] you get that thought in your mind oh I'm
[41:11] such a horrible Christian how could he
[41:12] ever love me
[41:15] because he has a love that you can't
[41:16] understand
[41:18] [Laughter]
[41:21] Hallelujah hey if we be honest remember
[41:24] and James it says if you were offended
[41:26] at one point you're guilty of the whole
[41:29] brother random said what we backslide
[41:32] many times in a day
[41:34] there's a God who identified himself as
[41:37] long suffering there's a God that what
[41:42] he said he delighteth in Mercy amen
[41:45] hallelujah what do you want you want to
[41:48] love that God but love that merciful god
[41:52] amen
[41:53] [Laughter]
[41:55] Hallelujah remember he can only see you
[42:00] like he's seen you on that book
[42:02] [Laughter]
[42:05] oh my
[42:07] see we don't even know what he's
[42:08] prepared for us
[42:10] the scripture says that and what man
[42:13] knows what God has prepared for us for
[42:14] them that love him
[42:17] Hallelujah he loves you that much
[42:21] so what you need to do is disregard
[42:23] anything
[42:26] that says that omnipotent love can't
[42:28] love you
[42:31] see how can you miss it
[42:34] how could you miss it you're entering
[42:35] into his love
[42:37] [Laughter]
[42:40] Hallelujah that's why the scripture says
[42:42] if any man fail the grace of God
[42:46] how do you fail his grace
[42:48] you have to lay it down
[42:50] you have to realize that you you have to
[42:52] think that you don't deserve Grace
[42:55] is unmerited favor
[42:58] so in all the things you're doing
[43:00] every day you find yourself you are
[43:02] still unmerited
[43:05] you cannot earn being the Bride of Jesus
[43:08] Christ
[43:10] you cannot earn the baptism of the Holy
[43:13] Ghost it's a gift
[43:16] Hallelujah so raise up your hands amen
[43:20] the god that loveth you amen has called
[43:23] you to a revelation that once you
[43:26] receive it you cannot get out of it
[43:28] hallelujah
[43:30] amen hallelujah how can I love him how
[43:34] can I worship my God how can I glorify
[43:37] the loving name of Jesus Christ amen
[43:42] Ma
[43:44] Hallelujah
[43:46] there's a song Oh How He Loves Us it's a
[43:49] truth brother sister

[43:56] Psalm 63 2. to see thy power and thy
[44:00] Glory
[44:01] so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary
[44:04] you realize David never went into the
[44:06] holies of holies
[44:08] he could not go into the holy place
[44:11] but he's still seen
[44:13] his power and His glory in the sanctuary
[44:19] see we get this picture we see the we
[44:21] see the Tabernacle
[44:22] and we're like yeah they're slaying
[44:24] animals and things like that and yeah
[44:25] you know it's just some sort of natural
[44:26] show it wasn't to David
[44:29] [Laughter]
[44:31] Hallelujah
[44:38] David was entering into
[44:40] a
[44:41] substitutionary measure of God's grace
[44:44] and he would see the power and the glory
[44:47] of God manifesting on him
[44:51] oh my soul if the substitution could
[44:55] produce that what about the innocent
[44:58] shed blood of the Living God Amen
[45:02] hallelujah what do you see today or she
[45:05] is power amen I see his glory amen
[45:09] Hallelujah his word hath declared it
[45:12] unto me amen
[45:19] because
[45:21] thy loving kindness
[45:23] is better
[45:25] than life
[45:27] his loving kindness
[45:29] that's how he loves you
[45:31] that's how his kindness is displayed
[45:34] through his love to you
[45:36] oh think about how many brother says I
[45:37] should have been dead already

[45:46] thank God amen amen

[51:01] upon what
[51:03] upon his heart
[51:10] you see
[51:12] what was going on in Song of Solomon
[51:15] is God was manifesting a deeper picture
[51:20] of his will
[51:22] and so much the fact is
[51:25] she was only fulfilling what his desire
[51:29] was the whole time
[51:36] when he goes and under the holy place
[51:38] for a memorial before the Lord
[51:40] continually
[51:43] for the high priest to go into the
[51:46] holies of holies
[51:48] God required
[51:51] that the names of Israel would be like
[51:54] what would be upon his heart
[51:59] get it
[52:00] set me as a seal upon thine heart
[52:07] think about it solving walking forward
[52:10] she was crying like nebius ill upon that
[52:14] heart you know
[52:16] Spurgeon said of course it is it is one
[52:18] and the same you have the heart but the
[52:20] heart will actually bring forth an
[52:21] action right if we love God we have one
[52:25] we give them our hearts but what does he
[52:26] do he brings forth action
[52:29] remember you're a type of the seraphim

[52:48] brother Branham said that those
[52:50] seraphims they needed those wings to
[52:53] stay in the presence of God
[52:56] and the one quote he said to live in the
[52:59] presence of God do we want to live in
[53:01] the presence of God
[53:03] this message shows us how to do it
[53:12] you

[53:23] judgment the urum and the filament
[53:27] which remembers what which is what
[53:28] that's brother Branson that was the word
[53:32] and they shall be upon Aaron's heart
[53:36] and your Prophet said that that was the
[53:38] breastplate that's what it was those
[53:40] stones remember when they would inquire
[53:42] of them they would light up to show the
[53:44] will of God
[53:47] wait a minute
[53:48] don't you see it
[53:52] if the representation holds true
[53:56] you should light up to manifest the word
[54:00] of God
[54:01] the will of God
[54:06] oh
[54:08] and Aaron shall bear the Judgment of the
[54:10] children of Israel upon his heart before
[54:12] the Lord continually

[54:21] and now we have what who is a seal
[54:26] the shuomite was which is the type of
[54:27] his church was upon his heart
[54:31] now Aaron

[54:37] him that to go into the presence of God
[54:40] he needs to have what the 12 tribes
[54:45] the Engravings of a Signet to manifest
[54:48] in this presence that's how the how it
[54:51] would be accepted
[54:56] oh I love it
[54:58] once again
[55:00] so first and foremost what's the great
[55:02] adorning here
[55:03] the greatest adorning that that what the
[55:06] high priest was walking in
[55:09] is with what
[55:12] Israel's love for him
[55:15] and his love for them
[55:20] why did
[55:22] why the hill of divorcement divorcement

[56:36] Israel continually into the presence of
[56:40] God

[57:16] not over because there's more there to
[57:18] make you excited

[59:11] see fail Grace boldly through Grace
[59:17] that we may obtain mercy and find Grace
[59:22] to help in a time of need

[59:28] our issues and situations last and
[59:30] persevere longer than they're supposed
[59:31] to because we don't do this

[1:00:13] there's your Old Testament
[1:00:14] could there be a new testament with this
[1:00:16] too
[1:00:20] I am provoking
[1:00:23] to love today
[1:00:25] I'm doing what I can through the word to
[1:00:28] provoke you to love your God greater
[1:00:32] because you're only come to a place
[1:00:34] you're expressing exactly what he
[1:00:36] desired to begin with
[1:00:39] foreign
[1:00:40] Hallelujah that's why you prophesied
[1:00:42] they said if you say something say I'm
[1:00:46] that one
[1:00:48] and one I'm going to make it I love my
[1:00:52] God Amen I'll worship my Lord
[1:00:56] I'm accepted because that's what you're
[1:00:57] saying I'm accepted
[1:01:01] I'm predestinated
[1:01:03] I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ the
[1:01:06] sinless Spotless virgin bride of Jesus
[1:01:09] Christ amen
[1:01:11] watch us
[1:01:14] when Jesus had thus said
[1:01:18] he was troubled
[1:01:20] in spirit
[1:01:22] and testified and said verily verily I
[1:01:25] say unto you that one of you shall
[1:01:27] betray me
[1:01:29] then the disciples looked one on another
[1:01:32] doubting
[1:01:34] of whom he spake
[1:01:37] now now now now
[1:01:40] there was leading
[1:01:44] on Jesus
[1:01:47] bosom
[1:01:54] remember
[1:01:55] Song of Solomon
[1:01:58] there she was walking leaning on his
[1:02:02] bosom
[1:02:07] where is the bosom
[1:02:18] now that was leaning on Jesus bosom one
[1:02:21] of his disciples Now watch how it ties
[1:02:23] in
[1:02:25] home
[1:02:26] Jesus loved
[1:02:33] what Authority does he have
[1:02:37] what Authority does John have
[1:02:41] to say I'm a disciple that Jesus loves
[1:02:47] foreign
[1:02:51] you see the revelation
[1:02:54] the shirt of I knew that Solomon loved
[1:02:57] her which brought her to a place of
[1:02:59] authority that she could say he loves me
[1:03:04] but her life was so great she said send
[1:03:08] me as a seal upon you
[1:03:12] I love you unconditionally ah
[1:03:16] I want to be your bride
[1:03:24] whom Jesus loved
[1:03:27] Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him
[1:03:30] that he should ask who it is
[1:03:32] should be of whom he spake
[1:03:34] he then
[1:03:36] lying on Jesus breast
[1:03:46] saith unto him
[1:03:48] Lord who is it
[1:03:51] you realize that John was the only one
[1:03:53] that was in a capacity that he could do
[1:03:55] this
[1:03:58] you know there's people especially you
[1:04:00] know even within our modern culture that
[1:04:02] they are saying
[1:04:04] that there was that was homosexual
[1:04:05] things there
[1:04:07] because they can't understand real love
[1:04:11] this was manifesting how tight-knit
[1:04:16] that John and Jesus were
[1:04:20] John's revelation of his love towards
[1:04:23] Jesus but he had a revelation of how
[1:04:26] much Jesus loved him
[1:04:33] he was so tight to Jesus that he could
[1:04:37] ask who Jesus Judas was and Jesus would
[1:04:41] tell him
[1:04:43] he was the one who knew who the deceiver
[1:04:46] was
[1:04:48] we know Peter probed him to do it
[1:04:51] but never says where he told Peter
[1:04:56] because where was he
[1:04:57] he was lying in Jesus breast
[1:05:00] Lord who is it
[1:05:03] how do you we we want to be the you know
[1:05:06] you know people in the message always
[1:05:07] ours is like yep that yep that I always
[1:05:09] knew he's surprised oh I knew his
[1:05:10] serpent serpenter
[1:05:12] that's not what this is this is love
[1:05:13] brother sister
[1:05:15] but it's going to come into play later
[1:05:20] Hallelujah
[1:05:22] Jesus answered he it is to whom I give a
[1:05:25] sop when I have dipped it and when he
[1:05:28] had dipped the SOP he gave it to Judas
[1:05:30] Iscariot the son of Simon
[1:05:32] notice
[1:05:35] is what I love
[1:05:37] you ever notice how they draw this
[1:05:40] they like John
[1:05:43] oh he's laying right
[1:05:46] up
[1:05:48] Hallelujah
[1:05:49] [Applause]
[1:05:56] you see
[1:05:58] he was setting himself as a seal upon
[1:06:01] the Heart of Jesus he
[1:06:05] [Applause]
[1:06:08] [Laughter]
[1:06:10] said
[1:06:11] Glory what am I trying to tell you you
[1:06:15] have a position with Jesus Christ get in
[1:06:19] the bosom
[1:06:20] it is an ordained revelation of your
[1:06:24] positional placement with Jesus Christ
[1:06:27] amen
[1:06:29] Hallelujah
[1:06:33] remember we are no more foreigners and
[1:06:35] strangers
[1:06:38] Hallelujah behold we are the family of
[1:06:39] God right
[1:06:44] a few more we're almost done
[1:06:46] John 21 4 but when the morning was now
[1:06:48] come Jesus stood on the shore
[1:06:50] of course after Resurrection but the
[1:06:52] disciples knew not that it was Jesus
[1:06:53] then Jesus said to them children have
[1:06:56] you any meat and they answered him no
[1:06:58] and he said to them cast the net on the
[1:07:00] right side of the ship and ye shall find
[1:07:03] they cast therefore and now they were
[1:07:05] not able to draw it in for the multitude
[1:07:07] of fishes therefore the dis that
[1:07:10] disciple
[1:07:11] whom Jesus loved
[1:07:15] saith unto Peter
[1:07:16] it is the Lord
[1:07:19] who had a revelation
[1:07:21] of the resurrected Christ
[1:07:28] he had to tell Peter
[1:07:33] you know why I'm saying this
[1:07:35] because there's a lot of doctrines that
[1:07:37] fly around this message
[1:07:39] but the bride will see the true
[1:07:42] resurrected Christ
[1:07:48] Hallelujah remember it's going to be so
[1:07:50] close it would deceive the elected if
[1:07:52] possible polygamy ain't that brother
[1:07:54] sister
[1:07:55] Two Souls ain't that
[1:07:59] it's going to be close
[1:08:00] well how will I know I'll tell you
[1:08:03] because you are the disciple whom Jesus
[1:08:06] loved amen hallelujah
[1:08:16] now when Peter heard that it was the
[1:08:18] Lord he gurt his Fisher's coat unto him
[1:08:21] before he was naked and did cast himself
[1:08:23] in the sea
[1:08:25] and the other disciples came in a little
[1:08:27] ship for they were not far from land but
[1:08:29] as it were 200 cubits dragging the net
[1:08:32] with fishes ah
[1:08:34] Peter needed that
[1:08:38] Hallelujah
[1:08:41] so you see
[1:08:44] that placing of the seal upon the heart
[1:08:49] Old Testament New Testament
[1:08:52] and Song of Solomon really brings to
[1:08:54] light
[1:08:55] her revelation of her position
[1:09:00] but what is it she knows how much God
[1:09:03] loves her
[1:09:05] and she is love sick for him
[1:09:11] Hallelujah John 21 20. then Peter
[1:09:14] turning about see the disciple whom
[1:09:16] Jesus loved following it is always
[1:09:19] he's saying he's always referring to
[1:09:21] himself as a disciple that Jesus loves
[1:09:24] you see they can tell you that that
[1:09:26] you're a call that you're a counterfeit
[1:09:27] that you're a failure
[1:09:30] undoubtedly they did the same thing to
[1:09:31] John
[1:09:33] remember
[1:09:34] diatrophes and third John would not even
[1:09:38] accept John into his church
[1:09:41] remember
[1:09:43] diographies who love it the preeminence
[1:09:46] he wouldn't even let John in the church
[1:09:50] but John said that what it was the
[1:09:53] disciple that Jesus loved amen
[1:09:58] he's not trying to brag
[1:10:00] he would address it would have Brad he
[1:10:02] could have wrote a lot bit different
[1:10:03] than this
[1:10:04] and it was me John the great disciple
[1:10:07] amazing disciple that Jesus loved but
[1:10:10] watch the humility because here's the
[1:10:12] thing
[1:10:12] who wrote that God is love John yeah
[1:10:17] first John 4.
[1:10:19] Hallelujah went to oh what first John
[1:10:22] always talking about the love love love
[1:10:24] love love what Peter James John faith
[1:10:28] hope love
[1:10:32] but wait John's the type of the Bride so
[1:10:34] what are you yeah Hallelujah
[1:10:40] then Peter almost done turning about see
[1:10:43] the disciple whom Jesus loved following
[1:10:45] which also leaned on his breast at
[1:10:47] supper
[1:10:51] you think those disciples
[1:10:53] they were looking at John they knew all
[1:10:54] about John
[1:10:56] Hallelujah but John John didn't say man
[1:10:59] actually you know I'm not good enough I
[1:11:02] shouldn't I shouldn't be like that I
[1:11:04] should never lean on Jesus breast that
[1:11:06] would not be right I can't do it but he
[1:11:09] was moved to do it
[1:11:11] were those other disciples
[1:11:13] his bride shower were they part of his
[1:11:16] church yeah
[1:11:18] but John
[1:11:19] John had a position there
[1:11:22] and this is where it comes in watch us
[1:11:25] then Peter turned about seeth the
[1:11:27] disciple whom Jesus loved following
[1:11:28] which also lean on his breath of supper
[1:11:30] and said Lord which is he that that
[1:11:33] that uh which is he that betrayeth thee
[1:11:36] Peter's seeing him saith to Jesus Lord
[1:11:39] and what shall this man do
[1:11:43] and Jesus saith unto him
[1:11:45] if I will that he tarry till I come
[1:11:49] what is that to thee follow thou me
[1:11:54] and then there is what
[1:11:56] there was a rumor that went through the
[1:11:57] church that John would see the rapture
[1:12:01] and ultimately John was the only one
[1:12:03] that wasn't martyred
[1:12:05] they tried to murder him but they
[1:12:06] couldn't they tried to boil boil them
[1:12:08] with oil yes
[1:12:09] couldn't boil he had so much oil on him
[1:12:11] the oil couldn't burn not him
[1:12:13] Hallelujah
[1:12:14] amen
[1:12:18] Hallelujah
[1:12:20] so what what's appointed for the one
[1:12:22] that leans Upon Jesus breast
[1:12:26] he's going to see the Lord's coming
[1:12:28] [Music]
[1:12:28] [Laughter]
[1:12:36] why because the church a type of John
[1:12:38] now think about this this goes you could
[1:12:40] take this all the way back to the Old
[1:12:41] Testament you had David and Jonathan
[1:12:45] David was a type of Christ Jonathan was
[1:12:47] a type of John
[1:12:49] Hallelujah
[1:12:54] but what does that tell you
[1:12:56] that tells you how much he loves you
[1:12:58] he's revealed the word to me I get it
[1:13:01] let's stand
[1:13:03] thank you for patience I went right
[1:13:05] around an hour and 15 almost
[1:13:08] Hallelujah
[1:13:10] amen
[1:13:12] you see let the word move you
[1:13:16] into a place that you love him more
[1:13:20] why is that in there
[1:13:22] why does all that tie in in parallel why
[1:13:24] does that do that because Christ is
[1:13:26] trying to bring a revealed word in the
[1:13:28] season to positionally place you
[1:13:32] so think about that I don't know how I
[1:13:34] can love God more don't worry about that
[1:13:36] say God I love you more
[1:13:39] be a product of your spoken word amen
[1:13:44] Hallelujah
[1:13:46] brother Brown said
[1:13:53] there's a quote I hope I can I can say
[1:13:55] this right but brother random said he
[1:13:57] said he said if you don't have the Holy
[1:13:59] Ghost he said just keep on saying it and
[1:14:01] God will end up giving it to you
[1:14:04] keep believing
[1:14:06] hold to that because you think you can't
[1:14:07] say it without believing it
[1:14:09] you see what I'm saying
[1:14:11] because if you don't believe it you'll
[1:14:12] just quit saying
[1:14:13] yeah if that ain't your passion you'll
[1:14:15] quit saying it
[1:14:16] but remember they that hunger and thirst
[1:14:18] for a righteousness sake shall be filled
[1:14:22] amen that shows your hunger
[1:14:25] Hallelujah
[1:14:26] so what's our prayer today
[1:14:29] at me
[1:14:31] as a seal upon thine heart
[1:14:33] and upon
[1:14:37] you think Paul knew it who shall lay
[1:14:39] anything to the charge of God's elect
[1:14:43] who's gonna land
[1:14:45] on you brother who's got land charge on
[1:14:47] you
[1:14:48] nobody
[1:14:52] it is God that justifies amen
[1:14:57] amen what is that right
[1:14:58] you realize two weeks before brother and
[1:15:00] brother brahm's Ministry ended the very
[1:15:02] end of 65. he said now my Revelation is
[1:15:05] this he says you're Justified you never
[1:15:07] did it in the first place
[1:15:09] you realize right after that God took
[1:15:11] him home
[1:15:14] who's going to lay a charge to you
[1:15:16] you see how this Revelation should have
[1:15:17] kicked in
[1:15:19] you see what the challenges are it's
[1:15:21] right there well I do believe it
[1:15:24] nobody can lay a charge to you not that
[1:15:27] you willfully sin not even say Oh Glory
[1:15:29] I gotta I got a card to send for free
[1:15:31] now
[1:15:32] ain't that because if you do that it
[1:15:33] shows you don't even love them
[1:15:37] but you got this you got this thing you
[1:15:38] gotta fight all the time you stay in
[1:15:40] love with Jesus keep serving Jesus and
[1:15:42] don't worry you'll draw closer amen who
[1:15:45] is he that condemneth it is Christ that
[1:15:47] died yea rather that is risen again who
[1:15:49] is even at the right hand of God who
[1:15:51] also make an intercession for us who
[1:15:52] shall separate us from the love of
[1:15:55] Christ you can't be separated from her
[1:15:58] you can
[1:16:00] do you believe you can because you can
[1:16:04] if someone's telling you you can't then
[1:16:06] is that God or is that the devil it'd be
[1:16:08] the devil because this says you can't be
[1:16:10] separated
[1:16:13] does he love you
[1:16:15] he does
[1:16:18] how about tribulation got separating no
[1:16:21] how about distress nope persecution nope
[1:16:24] famine nakedness Peril sword nope as is
[1:16:28] written for thy sake we are all we are
[1:16:30] killed all the day long we are counted
[1:16:32] as sheep for the slaughter nay and all
[1:16:34] these things we are more than conquerors
[1:16:35] through him that loved us
[1:16:38] remember
[1:16:40] 64 question answers brother Ram said he
[1:16:42] said he said on this side of the river
[1:16:44] he said we don't have to wear a martyr's
[1:16:46] crown
[1:16:47] so what should you believe it's coming
[1:16:49] brother sister it's going to look like
[1:16:50] you could be murdered
[1:16:55] but remember if you've already found
[1:16:56] Grace with him you're going to walk
[1:16:58] right through it
[1:17:00] just like Jesus did he couldn't be taken
[1:17:03] until his time
[1:17:04] he couldn't be taking a crucifixion
[1:17:06] until his time but you cannot be taken
[1:17:09] to crucifixion or martyrdom because you
[1:17:13] are already crucified with him
[1:17:17] God so you see you've got to believe it
[1:17:22] you've got to love him and you've got to
[1:17:24] realize that his love says this about
[1:17:27] you
[1:17:30] Frank persuaded that neither death nor
[1:17:32] life nor angels nor personalities nor
[1:17:34] powers or nor things present nor things
[1:17:35] that come nor height nor debt nor any
[1:17:37] other creature shall be able to separate
[1:17:39] us from the love of God which is in
[1:17:41] Christ Jesus our lord
[1:17:45] thank you
[1:17:46] Hallelujah
[1:17:48] I hope you're feeling here because he is
[1:17:50] hallelujah

[1:18:02] want to or like I see it but I know he
[1:18:04] loves me and he's bringing me to it
[1:18:07] Hallelujah
[1:18:14] so what do you call him today

[1:18:23] to Manifest this love to him

[1:18:33] not in a disrespect he did what God told
[1:18:36] him to do
[1:18:38] and the shulamite was moved on by the
[1:18:42] word surrounding her
[1:18:43] he said set me as a seal on your heart
[1:18:46] in your arm
[1:18:51] when they see me let them see you
