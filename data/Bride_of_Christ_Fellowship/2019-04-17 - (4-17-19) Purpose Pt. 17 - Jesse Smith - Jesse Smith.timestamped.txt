[10:36] books they have the big words and I'm
[10:37] like sure praise the Lord
[10:39] so that's how you thought you found me

[27:53] the church said amen praise God god
[27:57] bless you let's go to Ephesians chapter
[27:59] 5 here tonight hopefully everybody got
[28:02] my text today about this weekend's
[28:04] schedule sorry didn't get out sooner
[28:06] just kind of forgot about it but by
[28:09] God's grace we got it but like - I said
[28:13] do a Bible study tonight but I was
[28:14] before I knew brother any men was coming
[28:16] then when he comes it feels like we just
[28:18] need to have a service you know cuz he
[28:20] does such a good job at song leading so
[28:23] but I did say I'll try to keep the
[28:25] sermon a little shorter here tonight by
[28:26] God's grace personally I just got to
[28:28] watch you know my physical health as I
[28:31] tell you many times when my voice went
[28:32] out a couple years ago is actually on
[28:33] Easter when my voice went out a fuse we
[28:35] miss some some of you might remember
[28:36] that I was preaching like this for
[28:38] Easter and I told the Lord I said lord
[28:41] if you let my voice come back I'll try
[28:42] to do a better job of taking care of my
[28:45] body and so I've been trying to do that
[28:48] I preached twice on Sunday I preached
[28:49] Tuesday morning a Bible Club gotta
[28:51] preach tonight free Sunday for each
[28:53] Friday so three four five six times this
[28:57] week okay two three four five yeah six
[29:01] times this week so all things are
[29:03] possible
[29:04] God's with me I just gotta say God give
[29:07] me grace there's nothing we love more
[29:09] than the Word of God so it's a privilege
[29:11] for me to do it I just gotta take care
[29:13] of my temple and I know it's a privilege
[29:15] for you to hear God's Word as well
[29:16] because there's nothing good I can say
[29:18] only if Jesus would would inspire me to
[29:21] say it so let's go to Ephesians 5
[29:32] let's go to verse 10 I want to look at
[29:35] part 17 here on purpose again and we'll
[29:38] just look at redeeming the time again
[29:40] you know we spent both services on
[29:42] Sunday you know looking at redeeming the
[29:44] time and I want to get a little bit
[29:46] further on this and hopefully it'll be a
[29:48] blessing tonight I don't have any slides
[29:52] salud a little you know if we're about
[29:53] switching over I didn't have time to get
[29:55] slides up there he is five verse 10 and
[30:01] this way I like to do I like to do verse
[30:05] 10 don't you we like to prove what's
[30:06] acceptable to God that's why we preach
[30:09] and study is to prove this is the
[30:11] perfect will of God
[30:12] and that's the permissive will of God
[30:14] but we're gonna do the perfect will of
[30:16] God
[30:17] seasons 5:10 proving what is acceptable
[30:19] unto the Lord and have no fellowship
[30:22] with the unfruitful works of darkness
[30:24] but rather reprove them for it's a shame
[30:29] even to speak of those things which are
[30:30] done of them in secret but all things
[30:33] that are reproved are made manifest by
[30:36] the light for whatsoever doth make
[30:39] manifest is light now that's quite a
[30:43] statement there anytime your life shines
[30:45] on people's lives and they say mine I
[30:47] didn't know that you know you shared
[30:52] that with me and I was I'm in sin
[30:54] anytime you do that you are manifesting
[30:58] the light of God or someone says mine
[31:02] maybe they don't say it out loud but
[31:03] they get convicted
[31:04] alright this brother lives like this
[31:05] this sister lived like this I'm
[31:07] convicted anytime you do that you are
[31:10] the light of Christ manifested see
[31:15] whatever makes manifest is light verse
[31:19] 14 wherefore he saith awake thou that
[31:21] sleepest and arise from the dead and
[31:23] Christ shall give the light he men now
[31:28] that reminds us of the foolish virgins
[31:29] right the wise and foolish virgins
[31:31] they're waking from their sleep right
[31:33] and that God Christ has given us light
[31:35] see then that you walk circumspectly
[31:37] that means precisely not as fool's but
[31:40] as wise to see foolish virgins they just
[31:44] kind of
[31:45] from here wander to here wonder there a
[31:47] lot of them just wonder from this church
[31:49] to that church to that church it's
[31:51] different if God's calling you but it's
[31:53] it's foolish if it's just well I don't
[31:55] like that too much and I'll just try
[31:57] something else you know without a divine
[31:59] call from the Holy Spirit redeeming the
[32:05] time because the days are evil wherefore
[32:08] be not unwise but understanding what the
[32:09] will the Lord is and be not drunk on
[32:12] wine which it wearing is excess but be
[32:14] filled with the spirit speaking to
[32:17] yourselves in Psalms and hymns and
[32:18] spiritual songs singing and making
[32:20] melody in your heart to the Lord
[32:22] wow this is a real wise Christian life
[32:24] right here talking about the word
[32:26] talking about songs spiritual songs
[32:30] making melody in your heart to God and
[32:32] now you're wise um like this giving
[32:36] thanks always for all things unto God
[32:39] the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus
[32:41] Christ let's have one more word of
[32:43] Prayer Heavenly Father Lord take this
[32:45] word Lord we've opened it we've read it
[32:47] break it to your people break it to me
[32:49] and father just continue to minister to
[32:51] us Lord hears we've heard the songs and
[32:53] here we're here to be finding our weak
[32:56] spots as your prophets said Lord and
[32:57] become better Christians and so father
[32:59] we just ask that your Holy Spirit will
[33:01] take control I yield myself to you Lord
[33:03] just may be a faithful servant in Jesus
[33:05] Christ's name and the church said Amen
[33:08] god bless you didn't see - praise God so
[33:12] got a little outline you know what like
[33:14] I said I don't have slides today but I
[33:17] got a little outline like I like to
[33:19] preach on this is quite a great text you
[33:22] know Ephesians chapter 5 it's building
[33:25] and of course this all these scriptures
[33:26] built into the marriage scriptures and
[33:30] so it's quite it's quite wonderful to
[33:33] see how paul is led of the Holy Spirit
[33:36] to get into this before he gets into
[33:38] marriage and how a marriage glorifies
[33:39] God he starts by saying your life will
[33:44] manifest the light of Christ and you you
[33:46] by your life you will either you'll
[33:48] manifest the people what's right and
[33:50] what's wrong you are the light of the
[33:52] world and then he goes in this showing
[33:54] how we must walk of our all of our
[33:57] decisions must be
[33:59] effect which means precise so we should
[34:02] know precisely what God wants us to do
[34:04] praise God
[34:06] but in the moment I remember remember
[34:07] have said though the will of God is a
[34:09] mystery right
[34:10] God's will is a mystery so that's what
[34:12] we must seek out and God kind of plays
[34:15] this hide-and-seek kind of game right
[34:16] God now it's not a game but it's a
[34:19] hide-and-seek romance can I say like
[34:20] that you see it in the Song of Solomon
[34:22] you know they get married and then the
[34:25] Bible said in a couple of chapters she
[34:27] wakes up and wants to find her beloved
[34:29] so she goes out looking for her beloved
[34:31] have you seen my beloved where is he and
[34:35] they said oh he's gone down to the
[34:36] garden right so she's got to seek him
[34:39] out there's other times at one time he's
[34:41] knocking at the door and she doesn't
[34:42] want to get out of her her bed she's a
[34:44] little slothful by the time she gets
[34:46] there she opens the door he's gone right
[34:49] and then she has to say she's sorry I
[34:51] preach on that a few years ago a little
[34:52] series on but it's like this
[34:54] hide-and-seek romance and that's how God
[34:57] is like Jesus said God hides it from the
[34:59] wise and the prudent but reveals it to
[35:01] babe's such as we learn it's a great
[35:03] hide-and-seek romance but once you find
[35:10] Christ then he reveals his will to you
[35:13] and he reveals what we should do
[35:17] of course I'll never forget when I asked
[35:19] God to show me or am I supposed to
[35:20] preacher not just vindicated to me so I
[35:23] know and I didn't really realize the
[35:25] brother he meant but I was actually
[35:26] asking God is this your will for my life
[35:27] or not I didn't really realize it but in
[35:30] that when I prayed him fasted and asked
[35:32] him for the vindication God gave me the
[35:34] vindication and I never had a doubt
[35:36] after that I've had some doubts or some
[35:38] fears you know from time to time we go
[35:40] through that but I never had to doubt
[35:41] after that because God had vindicated to
[35:44] me and we've got to remember like David
[35:48] the times God has answered our prayer
[35:50] like when David's through the line when
[35:53] David's through the bear he had to
[35:54] remember to use those testimonies for
[35:56] his next battle and that's what we've
[35:59] got to do too we've got to use our
[36:01] previous victories as as evidence and
[36:06] encouragement to go into our next battle
[36:08] and that's what I'll do it was times I
[36:11] struggle I look back and the
[36:13] a spirit will bring to remembrance
[36:14] remember when I did that remember when I
[36:15] blessed you there when I remember when I
[36:17] answered your prayer there remember what
[36:19] I gave you an amen to your ministry
[36:21] I guess I'm picking on you today but I'm
[36:23] sorry don't want to pick on anybody but
[36:25] I know he can take it but God you know
[36:29] God so we look back and we remember when
[36:31] when God does things we've got to use
[36:34] that and then that gives us strength
[36:36] going forward so God will reveal his
[36:39] perfect will to us if we just ask him
[36:42] but then we got to really ask right in
[36:44] faith believing and you have to see God
[36:46] with all your heart and then you'll find
[36:48] him that's the trouble when people don't
[36:51] know the will of God it's because they
[36:53] haven't sought it with all their hearts
[36:55] they've given 50 percent of their effort
[36:57] maybe you know 70 percent their effort
[37:00] 75 but we want to give a hundred percent
[37:03] effort to say lord I really need to know
[37:06] show it to me help me to lay aside
[37:08] everything that I might know your will
[37:12] for my life that's one of the twelve
[37:14] mysteries of the New Testament if you
[37:16] count those up that's one of the
[37:17] mysteries because Paul said in Ephesians
[37:19] 1 he's made known to us the mystery of
[37:21] his will so wise virgins walk
[37:24] circumspectly redeeming the time and
[37:26] that's I looked it up again today that's
[37:28] the only time the word redeem sorry
[37:31] that's the only time the word redeem is
[37:34] ever used with something connected to us
[37:37] and not to Christ look in your
[37:41] concordance sometime look up redeem its
[37:43] word redeemed by the blood
[37:44] we're redeemed by the Savior redeemed by
[37:46] it's always referring to Jesus but
[37:48] there's one time right here where Paul
[37:51] says you and I have something to redeem
[37:54] and that's the time the precious time
[37:56] that God gives us now Paul says when you
[38:01] when you understand God's will you're
[38:03] wise you'll buy back that time so in
[38:05] order to buy something what do you got
[38:07] to do you got to give up something right
[38:09] how many want to redeem the time how
[38:12] many want to buy the time back well you
[38:13] got to give up something for that right
[38:15] so let's go to Colossians I believe it's
[38:19] chapter power yeah the Colossians 4
[38:22] sorry
[38:26] verse 1 and next we'll look at Holy Days
[38:33] and Holy Week you know on Facebook I'm a
[38:35] friends a lot of people family members
[38:37] and they put up all these things about
[38:38] Oh Holy Week Holy Week best week of the
[38:40] year now programmed it's a it's a holy
[38:42] time of the year but the trouble there's
[38:45] a lot of people that emphasize that the
[38:47] rest year they go hog-wild with the
[38:49] world and I'll be honest the people that
[38:52] I've seen pump up holy day they pump up
[38:55] Buckeyes football more than Holy Week
[38:57] right or they they pump up Halloween or
[39:03] Thanksgiving or Christmas they pump up
[39:06] Santa Claus more than they pump up Holy
[39:08] Week so see you really find out which
[39:11] one you really love more by your fruits
[39:13] right by your fruits you know them by
[39:16] their actions like I don't see them
[39:20] saying oh there's let's do a countdown
[39:22] there's 97 days till Holy Week no but
[39:26] they'll post there's 120 days till
[39:28] kickoff of the football season Church by
[39:32] their fruits they're known right we see
[39:36] and we'll get to this a little bit it's
[39:38] okay to have special times of seeking
[39:40] the Lord that's fine but and that that's
[39:43] a great Christian Liberty we have but
[39:46] we've got to make sure that every day
[39:48] and every week is a holy day and that
[39:52] there's just some that are more holy
[39:54] than others right I mean we got to give
[39:57] a little more effort sometimes than
[39:59] others so Colossians 4 1 and there's a
[40:02] great balance that and I kind of want to
[40:04] look at that tonight oh and I forgot
[40:09] there's one great prayer I need to
[40:10] remember at the end I talking to a
[40:12] school employee and they said there they
[40:15] work at the middle school and they said
[40:16] some of their their students have gone
[40:19] to the high school and now they're they
[40:21] have no gender they've changed their
[40:23] name so they're genderless and they just
[40:27] told me with with almost like sadness
[40:28] like can you pray for them I'm like yes
[40:30] so I had a reminder on my phone but I
[40:33] forgot well let's remember try to remind
[40:34] me to pray if I forget let's pray for
[40:37] those that we can
[40:40] if I can talk to them that's what I want
[40:41] to try to do I want to see if I know
[40:42] some of them so I can talk to them about
[40:44] it but I was able to get booked and she
[40:47] said yeah I'd be happy to read that so
[40:48] I'm really thankful Colossians 4 1
[40:52] masters give unto your servants that
[40:54] which is just and equal knowing that you
[40:57] also have a master in heaven continue in
[41:01] prayer and watching the same with
[41:02] Thanksgiving with all praying also for
[41:05] us that God would open unto us a door of
[41:08] utterance to speak the mystery of Christ
[41:11] for which I'm also in bounds the bonds
[41:14] that I may make it manifest as I ought
[41:17] to speak so here's a man then I love
[41:20] this scripture this scripture means a
[41:21] lot to me Paul says pray for me that
[41:25] I'll have more boldness and that God
[41:27] will open a door of utterance all right
[41:30] that I may speak the mystery of Christ
[41:33] which is the Godhead right the mystery
[41:36] of Christ because he mentions that in
[41:38] Colossians chapter 2 and he says I ought
[41:43] to speak like this so that we ought to
[41:44] take courage that sometimes even a
[41:46] prophet of God isn't as bold as he needs
[41:48] to be they don't encourage us to know
[41:50] that he's human
[41:51] and a prophet a sort of lie upon more
[41:53] Holy Spirit just like you and I need to
[41:56] rely upon more of the Holy Spirit
[41:58] prophets go through up and downs
[42:00] prophets goes through hills and valleys
[42:02] and if prophets goes through hill and
[42:03] valley then the rest of the bride goes
[42:05] through his and valleys the rest of the
[42:07] rides needs to pray God give me strength
[42:08] give me grace open doors to me help me
[42:11] to be more bold he said pray for me
[42:15] Church you church in Kalasha
[42:17] brave for me that I'll have doors open
[42:22] in the verse 5 walking wisdom toward
[42:25] them with our that are without redeemed
[42:27] the time remember wisdom means deep
[42:31] understanding if you look up the Greek
[42:33] it means a deep understanding of the
[42:34] word of God not just a superficial but a
[42:37] deep understanding to know what God
[42:39] wants done with the word and here's how
[42:42] you do it verse 6 let your speech be
[42:43] always with grace you know we shouldn't
[42:45] go around condemning people I know you
[42:47] don't but just a reminder right we got
[42:49] to be careful
[42:51] let there be grace God may have
[42:53] see on these children you know or these
[42:55] high schoolers that are getting confused
[42:57] with gender you know that's a right may
[43:00] God have mercy they gotta have mercy on
[43:02] my dad or my mother
[43:03] they got God have mercy so we should
[43:05] always speak with Grace in our hearts
[43:07] seasoned with salt that you may know how
[43:10] you ought to answer every man at church
[43:14] I'll be honest you can do that if you
[43:16] watch the Scriptures you read in the
[43:18] morning before you go out and talk to
[43:19] people watch those scriptures because
[43:21] God many times will use some of those
[43:23] and reminding you what to say when you
[43:26] see people that day how many how do you
[43:29] ever see Matt what happens all the time
[43:30] when I go to Bible club with middle
[43:32] schoolers or the elementary it'll be
[43:34] something I read and one of the children
[43:36] will say something about it or the one
[43:38] of the leaders will say something about
[43:39] it like I just read that this morning it
[43:40] happens like constantly so watch what
[43:43] you say because there's a reason you
[43:46] read your Bible every morning so that
[43:49] scripture is on your heart it's ready to
[43:50] go and then you'll know how to answer
[43:52] every man now I just want to stop right
[43:57] there so there's really just two times
[43:59] in the Bible where it says you and I can
[44:01] redeem something in the New Testament
[44:03] okay and that's what it is redeeming the
[44:06] time buying back that time so if you're
[44:12] buying something you got to lose
[44:13] something and the thing you lose is your
[44:15] own will of what you want to do with
[44:17] your time you gotta say God show me how
[44:21] should I spend my time this morning or
[44:23] God how should I spend my free time
[44:25] right how should I spend my day off how
[44:29] should I spend my again how should I
[44:31] spend my Saturday how should I spend my
[44:34] evening after work we gotta have enough
[44:36] wisdom right we gotta have enough
[44:38] circumspect circumspect steps right
[44:42] precise steps we got to know precisely
[44:45] what God would have us to do amen I know
[44:49] that's saying a lot Church I know it is
[44:51] remember you need to you need to rest
[44:54] your body right you got to take care of
[44:55] your body you got to take care of your
[44:58] mind you need that you need to take
[45:00] vacations you do you do brother Rancic
[45:04] occasions jesus took vacations short
[45:07] ones but you and i need to take
[45:09] vacations in this rest get our strength
[45:11] back
[45:12] get our meditation back invest invest in
[45:18] time with god almighty remember that's
[45:21] what remember that Daniel did that
[45:22] remember when he got that 21 week or
[45:24] sorry 21 day prayer answer the Bible
[45:27] said he prayed and fasted for three
[45:28] weeks and he was 70 years old I saw that
[45:31] this morning I was going through my
[45:32] notes a 70 year old servant to the
[45:35] government said can I take a three-week
[45:37] vacation and they gave it to him so he
[45:40] could go fast and pray by the river
[45:41] Ahava what a vacation huh that's a
[45:47] prophets idea of vacation you thought
[45:51] what maybe a cruise well maybe got to
[45:55] lead you on that I'm not said I'm not
[45:56] here to say you wouldn't but I'm saying
[45:59] is that look what look what he desire he
[46:02] desired God in my free time I want to
[46:05] know you tomorrow now you can go on a
[46:07] cruise and see God more but you better
[46:09] be careful of all the all the riffraff
[46:11] can I say like that of all the
[46:13] temptation you got to have a real
[46:16] spiritual mind see because a lot of
[46:20] people on that cruise ship are not
[46:22] seeking God and that's not a very good
[46:25] atmosphere so I'm just trying to share
[46:28] some basic thoughts about redeeming the
[46:31] time by God's grace and those are the
[46:34] only two those are the two scriptures
[46:36] where you and I can redeem something now
[46:39] let's go to romans 14:5 i want to just
[46:42] balance this out to you know every year
[46:46] i got to battle this you know like i
[46:47] said i'm when i'm on facebook or i
[46:49] talked to my friends and well I'm doing
[46:51] Lent and that's just a short battle sent
[46:53] a long battle what's a short battle
[46:55] because people they seem to be so
[46:57] sincere and they seem to me sacrificing
[47:02] but in all reality it's not it's not a
[47:05] real genuine sacrifice because it's just
[47:08] a temporary sector except for sacrifice
[47:10] right forty days and who knows if all
[47:13] those people actually make it through
[47:14] the forty days
[47:16] they probably got to repent many times
[47:19] and say okay God forgive me and they're
[47:21] giving up things like Facebook or
[47:23] chocolate or like a sugary drink they're
[47:27] giving up pop like the zakat you I mean
[47:30] yeah it's good to take care of your body
[47:31] but does that get you closer to the
[47:32] kingdom of God given up Diet Pepsi for
[47:35] 40 days of course not but see look at
[47:40] the Bible says here one man esteemeth
[47:41] one day above another another esteemeth
[47:43] every day like let every man be fully
[47:45] persuaded in his own mind
[47:46] so let's the Christian liberties are our
[47:51] decisions you have and whether you do it
[47:53] or not it doesn't it's not sin and Paul
[47:59] says respect people who make one day
[48:02] holy and another day not holy Paul says
[48:06] respect them okay I'm not going to go
[48:09] through maybe all the scriptures I
[48:10] pulled it up in chapter 5 of my book I
[48:13] have a whole long section on Christian
[48:15] liberties so if you like to understand
[48:18] it I think I gave everybody copy you
[48:20] could read that if you want to but the
[48:23] main thing is that no matter what it is
[48:25] look at verse 6 the main thing is be
[48:28] thankful so when you see churches all
[48:31] we're really going to dedicate this week
[48:33] to God you should be thankful for that
[48:35] hopefully you know they're sincere
[48:37] enough where God can speak to him he
[48:40] that regardeth the day regardeth it unto
[48:41] the Lord and He that regardeth not the
[48:43] day to the Lord he not does not regard
[48:45] it he that eateth eateth to the Lord
[48:46] where he for he giveth God thanks and he
[48:49] that eateth not to Lord he give I'm
[48:52] sorry he eateth not and giveth God
[48:54] thanks let's read verse 7 for none of us
[48:58] liveth to himself and no man dieth to
[49:00] himself so the main thing church is that
[49:04] we give Thanksgiving from what I
[49:06] remember from from the text on Christian
[49:08] liberties the main thing is that you
[49:10] give thanks so when you hear o my church
[49:13] is having special meetings thank the
[49:15] Lord when our church has special
[49:17] meetings thank the Lord and hopefully
[49:19] you do hopefully when we have guest
[49:20] ministers in or like this Friday we have
[49:23] a special Friday service hopefully you
[49:25] consider a time where I can draw closer
[49:27] to the Lord I'm going to try to live
[49:28] closer to
[49:29] Lord but if not be thankful that some
[49:34] people are right because that's what
[49:38] Paul says it's your Christian Liberty
[49:40] because the Bible does in the New
[49:43] Testament doesn't give us specific holy
[49:45] days where you need to live more holy on
[49:48] the new moon you know or you need to
[49:50] live more holy around Easter time the
[49:53] fact is if you got the Holy Ghost you're
[49:55] living holy all the time
[49:56] that's what the new birth is all about
[49:59] him that's what the Sabbath is all about
[50:01] as we went over last week right that's
[50:03] the true rest you rest from sinning and
[50:06] you're living to righteousness that's
[50:09] what the new birth is all about now go
[50:12] to Colossians here let me pull it up
[50:15] cautions 2:16 and this is the one where
[50:18] you know I've just been able to I've
[50:22] been able to stand on this when the
[50:23] Saturday Sabbatarians trying to corner
[50:25] me I said well you know this is what
[50:27] Paul said look what the Word of God says
[50:30] verse 16 let no man therefore judge you
[50:33] in meat or in drink or in respect of an
[50:36] holyday or of the new moon or the
[50:39] Sabbath days so you don't let somebody
[50:41] judge you so you don't don't feel judge
[50:43] like oh I'm not keeping Saturday like I
[50:46] ought to verse 17 which are shadow of
[50:50] things to come but the body is of Christ
[50:52] see those are all shadows sabbath days
[50:55] holy days those are all shadows but the
[50:59] reality is Christ in other words a day
[51:02] doesn't make you holy Christ makes you
[51:05] holy that's what makes you holy
[51:08] it's Christ because those are all
[51:10] shadows Church they would take can you
[51:12] imagine being a Jew would be a blessing
[51:15] in some ways you had seven days for
[51:18] unleavened bread and you'd have to
[51:19] didn't have to work right and then in
[51:25] August and September you have like 14
[51:28] days off for David oh man you know a
[51:32] Bernanke's yeah you have all these
[51:34] holidays note on your schedule some
[51:37] dives were a little bit spiritually
[51:39] jealous of that
[51:42] but not really because we got the blood
[51:43] of Christ right you understand I'm see
[51:48] it's cuz it though really is it's Christ
[51:50] Christ makes us free and we don't have
[51:53] to wait til boy I can't wait to that one
[51:55] day in September when I can be forgiven
[51:57] ah I can be forgiven right now of all
[52:02] the years past sins and my failures I
[52:04] can be forgiven now because the true
[52:07] retirement is now on the throne of God
[52:09] and I don't need pastor Jesse or if I
[52:13] had just been there out I don't need in
[52:15] this house offer the sacrifice for me
[52:17] because my high priest Jesus Christ
[52:19] Artie did it amen of course you
[52:23] appreciate the prayers of your pastor
[52:24] evangelist but they can't is it's not
[52:27] their sacrifice it's God that Christ is
[52:31] the one mediator between God and man to
[52:37] see it's it's uh it's it's something
[52:42] that we must guard our hearts and not
[52:44] feel condemned or judged because we
[52:46] don't have candle light services like
[52:48] other churches right which that's fine
[52:53] but a candle I see a lot of people that
[52:55] have the natural candle but don't got
[52:57] the spiritual candle that's right they
[53:00] then write that candle goes out they got
[53:03] their custom drinking get drunk and all
[53:05] that kind of things like that and as
[53:07] soon as Easter is here brother Haven
[53:08] they get right back to their diet soda
[53:10] or their chocolate or coffee or whatever
[53:14] they give up and they think that's real
[53:16] Christianity not Church
[53:17] you and I know that's not real
[53:18] Christianity but we should give thanks
[53:23] if somebody esteems this this is all the
[53:25] time thank god they're trying maybe one
[53:27] day God will open their eyes and they
[53:29] can see that you can give up chocolate
[53:31] forever or you can give up whatever the
[53:34] main thing is to give up a desire to sin
[53:37] give up a love for the world and have a
[53:40] love for the word of God Jesus Christ
[53:42] that's the main thing that people got to
[53:44] do we all got to do it now so I hope you
[53:50] can
[53:51] that through the scripture when we
[53:52] redeem the time we make every day a holy
[53:57] day in fact I I never I'll be honest I
[54:01] never feel any different on Easter
[54:03] Sunday than any other day
[54:04] I'm fasten user Sunday morning I'm
[54:07] passin usually every Saturday morning
[54:09] I'm fasting I mean it just it feels the
[54:13] same to me now sometimes you've seen it
[54:15] too sometimes I'll come in here I feel
[54:17] more annoying to than others right you
[54:19] too sometimes you're more anointed than
[54:21] other times and we thank God for those
[54:24] but it's not something we religiously
[54:28] mechanically have to schedule out now
[54:32] let me say this God honors though
[54:35] routine sacrifice like look at the
[54:38] Louisiana camp how many ever heard of
[54:40] that they have it right around Easter
[54:41] every year I mean hundreds of people say
[54:43] they get the Holy Ghost they're young
[54:44] people and it's not like a world well I
[54:46] mean people stream it worldwide people
[54:49] from all over the United States go there
[54:50] they're probably on their way right now
[54:51] Wendy's been there many times brother
[54:53] Brooks been there Simon and cam have all
[54:54] been there
[54:55] people get great experiences there
[54:57] because there's such expectation now God
[55:00] honors that every year not because they
[55:03] say this is a holier day than others but
[55:06] God honors it because there's so much
[55:07] sacrifice built into it they pray up to
[55:10] it there's people that sacrifice you
[55:12] know letting people say it their home
[55:14] there's extra prayers going into it
[55:16] people that cook for other people
[55:18] there's all these sacrifices in church
[55:20] God will honor anyone that sacrifices
[55:23] with a sincere heart God will honor
[55:27] those who honor him that's what God told
[55:29] Samuel even as a young child God told
[55:32] Samuel that I'll honor anyone that
[55:34] honors me so we must remember that too
[55:40] and there are times to seek the Lord
[55:42] more closely obviously and God will
[55:45] honor our sacrifice now one of they've
[55:50] got a few examples here so you can see
[55:54] this here about diligence and redeeming
[55:58] the time oh and look at these again now
[56:00] let's go back to 2nd Peter chapter 1
[56:01] let's go over the statue for a man just
[56:03] again here I want to lay the
[56:05] out as a reminder second Peter chapter
[56:07] one like I said I try to do little Bible
[56:11] study
[56:28] right now I think I like to start a
[56:34] verse let's just get right to it at
[56:36] verse verse five yeah sorry verse 5 2nd
[56:42] Peter 1:5 and beside this giving all
[56:44] diligence
[56:45] now that means earnestness how many ever
[56:49] been earnest for a meal you've been
[56:50] really hungry anyone ever been earnest
[56:53] how about earnest for a celebration like
[56:56] or how about a wedding well I can't wait
[56:58] for this wedding of my wedding I was
[57:01] pretty earnest for my way very earnest
[57:04] so that's what the word earnest means
[57:07] excited anticipating it so Peter says
[57:10] giving all earnestness in verse five add
[57:14] to your faith virtue that means you say
[57:16] my I can't wait God give me virtue
[57:18] you've given me faith Oh give me virtue
[57:21] Lord I'm so earnest for it I'm hungry
[57:24] for it amen
[57:25] and this is redeeming the time right and
[57:31] your faith virtue into your virtue
[57:32] knowledge to your knowledge temperance
[57:35] to temperance patience and patience
[57:37] godliness and the godless relic kindness
[57:39] and a brotherly kindness charity for
[57:41] these things be in you and abound they
[57:43] make you that ye shall neither be barren
[57:44] nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our
[57:47] Lord Jesus Christ
[57:49] so see you need the virtues of
[57:51] sanctification glory and the baptism
[57:54] only goes charity in order to produce
[57:55] the fruit of the Holy Spirit all right
[57:58] but he the lack of these things is blind
[58:00] and cannot see afar off and hath
[58:02] forgotten the knee was purged from his
[58:04] own old sins the people can forget that
[58:07] they're forgiven they can at one time
[58:09] believe I've forgiven thank God but if
[58:12] they don't keep growing and earnestly
[58:14] hungry for more of God and that they get
[58:16] stagnant they'll feel like sinners again
[58:18] right so we've got to be careful
[58:22] that if we ever feel like we're a sinner
[58:25] again it's because we're not saying God
[58:28] add to me add to me see we're not hungry
[58:31] on the thirsting for the things of God
[58:33] we must have just been whether we you
[58:35] know whether we tried to or not or you
[58:37] know whether we got tricked or deceived
[58:39] or whatever we were just feeding on the
[58:40] wrong thing
[58:41] we got a fiend say God add to me
[58:44] earnestly Lord I need more of this more
[58:46] patience more virtue more knowledge
[58:49] give me more faith we if we feed on that
[58:51] and if we're diligent for that
[58:53] then we'll produce the right fruit but
[58:56] if now we'll feel like am I even saved
[58:57] am I even forgiven I hope you've been
[58:59] praying your prayer closet it's been
[59:01] good for me this week like last week I
[59:03] put on the helmet of the salvation I
[59:05] know I'm saved because I met God's
[59:08] requirement
[59:09] I've repent and I've been baptized in
[59:11] Jesus Christ's name fill with the Holy
[59:13] Spirit say again tell me I'm not saying
[59:16] brother because I got the helmet of
[59:17] salvation on I know I'm saying you got
[59:22] to have that on but see if we don't if
[59:25] we don't constantly see desire lord give
[59:27] me more of yours it's Wednesday night
[59:29] I'm tired I worked all day that's fine
[59:30] no one give me more of your word help me
[59:33] just forget about my flesh for a couple
[59:34] hours so I can earnestly and diligently
[59:37] receive from you you see that's why
[59:43] people forget they're saved they forget
[59:45] what it felt like to be baptized do you
[59:49] member what it's like does everybody
[59:50] remember what it's feel it felt like
[59:51] when you got baptized the right way Oh
[59:53] glory
[59:55] you ought to felt good did you forget I
[59:58] hope you didn't forget that means you're
[1:00:00] not adding right we need to remember
[1:00:02] what was that like oh oh like I was
[1:00:06] bribe and now I see you praise God
[1:00:08] yeah like I always used to be a leper
[1:00:12] but I lost all my leprosy and now I'm
[1:00:14] clean in Jesus name I used to feel odd
[1:00:17] and dirty around people like bo-ram said
[1:00:19] before your your sanctified you just
[1:00:22] kind of feel dirty around the believers
[1:00:23] and you try to fit in but when you've
[1:00:25] been washed you just fit in with
[1:00:27] everybody you're saying oh it's just
[1:00:29] those if we can all talk and have a good
[1:00:30] old see you're not ashamed because
[1:00:32] you've been washed you've seen the spots
[1:00:35] this all they men

[1:00:39] know I'm one of them you're not
[1:00:43] wondering am I even saved I'm Ivan the
[1:00:45] messenger does God even love me right
[1:00:48] you know you're not worried about that
[1:00:50] you know you've been saved you've seen
[1:00:53] God do it you've seen God find you as a
[1:00:56] little lamb put you on his shoulder
[1:00:58] bring you into the flock here just be
[1:01:01] with all these other humble sheep mad
[1:01:04] man and we all just fellowship all
[1:01:07] together as a great flock of God amen
[1:01:11] you remember the view from up on the
[1:01:13] shoulder you remember that glory look at
[1:01:16] me I'm flying up in the heavenlies brace
[1:01:18] God look at this view I'm oh I'm an
[1:01:21] earthbound creature look I'm flying up
[1:01:23] here like an eagle glory not the mixed
[1:01:27] thing you know you're both Eagle and
[1:01:28] lamb right you know you're both of those
[1:01:30] you're kid like a lamb daily but then
[1:01:32] you got the noid thing of an eagle right
[1:01:35] now look verse 10 therefore for the
[1:01:40] rather brethren give diligence to make
[1:01:42] your calling election sure so see your
[1:01:46] eagerness to do something for Christ
[1:01:49] will prove to everybody which side
[1:01:52] you're left on which side you're chosen
[1:01:54] on amen but man there's a quote maybe I
[1:01:58] can pull it up well Graham said there's
[1:02:01] one thing I know it's a real proof
[1:02:03] someone's born again they just have a
[1:02:05] great desire to do something for the
[1:02:06] Lord praise God and that's what the
[1:02:10] scripture is saying give diligence to
[1:02:13] make it sure in other words prove to
[1:02:16] everybody that you're a bride member
[1:02:18] prove to them you're not foolish
[1:02:20] proved by your life give all your
[1:02:22] earnestness give all your effort give
[1:02:24] all your diligence all your strength to
[1:02:26] prove to everybody which side you're on
[1:02:30] prove to everybody that you've got oil
[1:02:33] in your lamp and you're not saying oh
[1:02:37] brother Amen can you give me some errand
[1:02:38] can you give me some of your anointing
[1:02:39] please sir please please would you would
[1:02:41] you would you give me some of your
[1:02:42] anointing here you know you have to go
[1:02:44] up and ask people about that because
[1:02:46] you've already gone to Jesus and got the
[1:02:48] anointing
[1:02:49] or you go get a fresh anointing every
[1:02:51] morning or every night whenever you have
[1:02:54] your prayer time see you're not leaning
[1:02:56] upon anyone else
[1:02:58] you're leaning upon Christ see and that
[1:03:03] proves to everyone prove to them that
[1:03:05] you're called to be a preacher prove
[1:03:07] that you're a song leader prove to
[1:03:09] everybody which get this in your life
[1:03:11] prove it and the way you do that is by
[1:03:14] giving all human effort to that that's
[1:03:19] right and that's what we'll see just
[1:03:23] next in a moment but look at this for if
[1:03:26] you do these things you'll never fall
[1:03:27] see if you constantly just focus on what
[1:03:30] God called you to do and give all your
[1:03:32] energy give all your attention to that
[1:03:34] the Bible says you'll never fall from
[1:03:37] grace hey man
[1:03:38] hallelujah look at brother Branham he
[1:03:42] never quit me in a profit right Satan
[1:03:44] tried to trick him with that complex we
[1:03:45] looked at on Sunday night Satan tried to
[1:03:47] trick him to get out of give being more
[1:03:49] diligent he wanted to just go up in the
[1:03:51] mountains cuz he thought you know Old
[1:03:52] Testament prophet I should be up there
[1:03:53] but God said no you stay amongst the
[1:03:55] people aren't you glad yeah
[1:03:58] if you do these things if you constantly
[1:04:00] just pour into the ministry God gave you
[1:04:03] then you'll never fall that's right
[1:04:06] Church so you've got to be careful that
[1:04:08] God doesn't I'm sorry that we don't let
[1:04:11] Satan distract us from our calling in
[1:04:13] life so let's go to first Timothy 4 and
[1:04:19] look at this a little closer first
[1:04:28] for now while you're turning there just
[1:04:31] remember that Peter ends that chapter by
[1:04:35] talking about if you do this you'll have
[1:04:36] an entrance into heaven so God will open
[1:04:38] up heaven's gates to you if you just
[1:04:41] focus on doing God's will for your life
[1:04:43] just pour yourself be eager to do God's
[1:04:45] calling and say God add to me God I need
[1:04:48] more of you if you do that God's got to
[1:04:50] open heavens doors for you and then he
[1:04:54] says I will put you always in
[1:04:56] remembrance even though you know these
[1:04:57] things I'm trying to stir you up by
[1:04:59] putting you remember members of these
[1:05:01] things that's what I'm trying to deny
[1:05:03] stir the people up praise God
[1:05:05] remember this is what you're calling to
[1:05:07] be this is what a Christian should be
[1:05:10] you don't want to fall you want to keep
[1:05:12] standing you don't want to fall off that
[1:05:14] that highway to heaven amen
[1:05:16] you don't want to fall off the way of
[1:05:18] holiness you want to let the right Road
[1:05:21] stir you up
[1:05:21] keep earnest be diligent focus on what
[1:05:25] God's called you to do and if you need a
[1:05:29] ministry let me know if any of you guys
[1:05:31] I should say guys forgive me if any
[1:05:33] brothers or sisters sorry sometime gonna
[1:05:34] get a little flesh you know many of you
[1:05:36] Saints here help me Lord
[1:05:38] a little tired you know I got up at 4:30
[1:05:41] this morning help me Jesus
[1:05:43] try to drink coffee and my flesh but if
[1:05:48] any of you saves in a ministry let me
[1:05:50] know I mean one ministry I have is you
[1:05:51] can pray for me another ministry is you
[1:05:53] could mail out books I mean I've I have
[1:05:55] a list of people with addresses to mail
[1:05:57] out books if anybody needs a ministry
[1:05:59] and I'll pay you for your time you know
[1:06:01] whatever or if you need a ministry I
[1:06:03] could help you out on that because one
[1:06:08] the Bible said we should have we should
[1:06:10] be addicted to the ministry of the
[1:06:11] Saints I believe I believe in setting
[1:06:14] postcards out the sinners we did that
[1:06:16] last year
[1:06:16] but there's something about a ministry
[1:06:19] to the Saints that God loves as well
[1:06:21] because a lot of those people are never
[1:06:23] gonna be saved we've got to give them a
[1:06:25] chance but there's something about God
[1:06:28] loves when we're so focused on his
[1:06:30] children because remember Jesus and I
[1:06:33] won't even pray for the sinners remember
[1:06:35] he said that in John 17 he said I don't
[1:06:37] pray for the world I pray for them that
[1:06:39] has heard the word through me so Jesus
[1:06:43] wouldn't I
[1:06:44] he wouldn't waste his prayers on now
[1:06:45] sinners now we're not Jesus so we don't
[1:06:47] know who's gonna be saved so we should
[1:06:48] pray for all men the Bible said Paul
[1:06:50] said pray for all men prayers for all
[1:06:53] men the Bible says so I'm just trying to
[1:06:57] bring a balance now 1st Timothy 4 let me
[1:07:08] turn the airside I just got the
[1:07:09] surrounding scripture now if you know
[1:07:11] this this is like Paul's word to the
[1:07:14] young preacher Timothy Timothy was an
[1:07:17] evangelist now brother Graham called him
[1:07:18] a pastor as well but in this book Paul
[1:07:21] calls him an evangelist he's that member
[1:07:23] do the work of an evangelist but look at
[1:07:27] verse 12
[1:07:29] first Timothy 4:12 let no man despise
[1:07:31] thy youth well I'm too young I can't
[1:07:35] really serve the Lord Paul said don't
[1:07:37] let anybody despise your youth don't
[1:07:39] worry about people looking down upon you
[1:07:41] he says but instead be an example of the
[1:07:43] believers in Word in conversation and
[1:07:45] charity and spirit and faith and
[1:07:47] impurity till i come give attendance to
[1:07:52] reading to exhortation and to doctrine
[1:07:54] neglect not the gift that is in thee
[1:07:56] which was given me by prophecy with
[1:08:01] laying on of the hands of the presbytery
[1:08:03] now let's stop right there Timothy has a
[1:08:05] gift of preaching and the church said he
[1:08:09] has a gift of preaching
[1:08:11] so Paul tells him here give attendance
[1:08:16] don't don't let people
[1:08:21] tell you that you can't live closer to
[1:08:22] God don't let people tell you that only
[1:08:24] you know you'll be an example once
[1:08:27] you're 10 years in the message or 30
[1:08:28] years in the message you know wait till
[1:08:32] you got about 30 years on your bell as a
[1:08:33] pastor and then then then you'll really
[1:08:35] be an example then no Paul said take the
[1:08:38] attitude that I need to be the example
[1:08:40] right now amen
[1:08:43] live your life like you are an example
[1:08:47] of pure Christianity live your life like
[1:08:50] if there's one person that makes in the
[1:08:52] rapture it's gonna be you yeah that's
[1:08:56] right
[1:08:59] he says you be the example and he said
[1:09:02] give attendance to what reading
[1:09:03] preachers need to read
[1:09:05] apparently Paul thought preachers need
[1:09:07] to read well I'll just pray all the time
[1:09:10] and not read and I'll look for
[1:09:12] inspiration no that's not what he told
[1:09:14] Timothy you got it you got to do all of
[1:09:16] that right if you Timothy if you want
[1:09:20] your gift to grow you've got to read the
[1:09:22] word to exhortation and the doctrine
[1:09:28] exhortation is the preaching teaching
[1:09:31] instructing and the doctrine doctrine is
[1:09:33] your instruction exactly what you
[1:09:35] believe remember Jesus preached a lot of
[1:09:37] doctrine remember his first doctor was
[1:09:38] the Holy Ghost baptism in John chapter 3
[1:09:42] if he does that if he reads preaches and
[1:09:46] gets doctrines ready then he is not
[1:09:49] neglecting his gift then he's taking
[1:09:51] care of his gift he's stirring up his
[1:09:52] gift yeah now look at verse 15 meditate
[1:10:00] upon these things give thyself wholly to
[1:10:03] them that's what I want to
[1:10:08] to that thy profiting may appear to all
[1:10:10] a church this is the real heart of this
[1:10:14] series of purpose is that you and I will
[1:10:17] be able to recognize what gift has God
[1:10:19] place in my life and then you will be so
[1:10:23] determined to use that gift for God that
[1:10:27] you'll give yourself wholly to that gift
[1:10:30] so if you have a gift of divine healing
[1:10:33] you'll go to your Saturday or Friday
[1:10:35] before the church services on Sunday you
[1:10:37] will be praying God used me Lord if I'm
[1:10:39] there go lay my hands on somebody or use
[1:10:42] me Lord or if you got to get the music
[1:10:46] you'll pray and say God just give me the
[1:10:48] songs that these songs glorify it your
[1:10:51] your focus is on one thing and that's
[1:10:53] the glorify God with the gifts in your
[1:10:55] life like our sister speaks in tongues
[1:10:59] right she should be she should be
[1:11:02] praying that Lord if you have a message
[1:11:03] help me to be ready to receive it just
[1:11:06] like I got to get my cause if I'm a
[1:11:08] preacher or if people been heal when I
[1:11:10] pray for them god I need your help I
[1:11:12] don't have any thoughts give me your
[1:11:14] thoughts to feed your people and I've
[1:11:17] got to give myself wholly to that praise
[1:11:20] God why that you're profiting may appear
[1:11:24] to all
[1:11:27] in other words everybody's going to know
[1:11:30] whether I'm investing in my gift or not
[1:11:33] ever he's going to know that right
[1:11:35] sister Beatrice sister Beatrice been a
[1:11:37] lot around a long time the message right
[1:11:39] she knows whether her pastor former
[1:11:42] pastor current pastor
[1:11:44] she knows whether he's been investing in
[1:11:46] his gift or not because the Bible said
[1:11:49] it appears to everyone praise God and
[1:11:54] sure let me say this it's not just for
[1:11:56] pastors it's for everybody if everybody
[1:12:00] has a gift the court of the Bible then
[1:12:03] everybody sees if you're investing in
[1:12:06] that gift or not
[1:12:08] what if brother let's just use Amen for
[1:12:10] picking on him tonight let's say he
[1:12:13] comes to church and he doesn't never do
[1:12:15] any new songs and then you never when
[1:12:18] you talk to him you know hey brother hey
[1:12:20] man you been fax any new songs
[1:12:21] no I've been going to the baseball games
[1:12:24] you know it's Indian season and he
[1:12:27] always wants talk about his Indians not
[1:12:29] look at this guy hits a homerun nah he's
[1:12:31] a picture look at this guy under miles
[1:12:33] per hour you know then you then you and
[1:12:35] I could tell Oh obviously he's not
[1:12:37] investing in his gift right
[1:12:40] but if he's meditating on those things
[1:12:43] God used me I'm a I'm an instrument you
[1:12:47] know I'm an instrument to play the
[1:12:49] instruments so God's people can worship
[1:12:51] if he's investing into that then his
[1:12:53] investment will be seen by everybody
[1:12:56] that's right so will money so will yours
[1:13:00] when you invest in the gifts God given
[1:13:03] to you everybody sees it not some but
[1:13:08] all everybody knows whether you've been
[1:13:12] praying or not
[1:13:14] everybody knows whether I've been
[1:13:16] studying or not that's right church but
[1:13:20] man said a man that hasn't been studied
[1:13:21] he'll get there and get all confused he
[1:13:24] said he won't know where he's going
[1:13:26] right because he hasn't been studied
[1:13:28] he hasn't been reading the word like you
[1:13:30] ought to so remember now this is this is
[1:13:37] the one thought I had that was new to me
[1:13:38] here as I was preparing not only does
[1:13:42] your profiting or not only do the fruits
[1:13:44] your gift not only are they seen by
[1:13:47] everyone the church but they're seen by
[1:13:49] Jesus when you meet him right cuz he's
[1:13:52] gonna say well done and I gave you five
[1:13:54] and you now you got ten I gave you two
[1:13:57] now you got four I gave you one
[1:14:00] now that guy didn't have any right but
[1:14:05] that was such a blessing to me you know
[1:14:09] we should we should in other words we
[1:14:10] should have an idea because we see the
[1:14:13] fruits of people's gifts here we should
[1:14:15] have an idea what Jesus is going to say
[1:14:17] to them because we should see that
[1:14:19] people's gifts property now amen uh he's
[1:14:23] really grown as a song leader but he's
[1:14:25] really grown in their gift of prophesy
[1:14:27] or she's really grown in her gift of
[1:14:30] wisdom or knowledge and understanding
[1:14:32] boy they're really growing with their
[1:14:33] gift of miracles how about that
[1:14:36] these are all these are the nine gifts
[1:14:38] and all these spirit and once you find
[1:14:41] your give once you God reveals this gift
[1:14:43] to you then you've got to invest in that
[1:14:45] and give yourself wholly to it and then
[1:14:47] everybody will see you profiting in that
[1:14:49] area we'll see now that takes all the
[1:14:55] pressure off of me and puts it on
[1:14:57] everybody and that's the opposite of the
[1:15:01] Nicolaitans spirit because the nickel
[1:15:05] and spirit divides the it puts the
[1:15:09] lantee versus the preachers and now just
[1:15:11] the preachers got to have an orgy come
[1:15:13] on brother give me some anointing
[1:15:15] tonight come on is that all you got like
[1:15:18] but you don't realize like the Holy
[1:15:19] Ghost ones anoint you so you agree with
[1:15:22] that and you pull on that until you pull
[1:15:24] something fresh from heaven like it's
[1:15:27] everybody working together it's
[1:15:30] everybody with an anointing not just me
[1:15:32] it's you anointed me anointed and it's
[1:15:35] heaven's anointing coming down on
[1:15:37] everybody but see Satan wants to put it
[1:15:41] all on the preachers and that's wrong it
[1:15:44] ought to be on the preachers it ought to
[1:15:46] be on the laity too and that's what that
[1:15:48] scripture says it's telling evangelists
[1:15:51] now if a van just need it well then the
[1:15:53] apostle needs it right and if the
[1:15:56] apostle needs it then the speaker and
[1:15:58] tongue needs it then the miracle worker
[1:16:00] right that's what the Bible says miracle
[1:16:02] workers who works miracles among you
[1:16:04] that's in Galatians chapter 5 how do
[1:16:08] they do that they do it by the Holy
[1:16:09] Spirit so see that's what I'm openness
[1:16:13] now that's the core that's that's the
[1:16:15] whole hope behind this because I want
[1:16:18] you to meet Jesus Christ and Jesus say I
[1:16:20] gave you these sounds you doubled them
[1:16:23] enter the joys of the Lord but I don't
[1:16:26] want you to go to heaven not knowing why
[1:16:28] I wonder what my gifts are Laura I
[1:16:30] wonder what tells you didn't give me I
[1:16:31] don't want you to meet Christ like that
[1:16:33] I want to preach to you that you can go
[1:16:36] to Christ now find out your gifts and
[1:16:38] you can invest in them and then he'll
[1:16:40] say well then you've doubled them your
[1:16:43] profit has appeared to everybody in the
[1:16:45] church your fruits are obviously in
[1:16:47] church
[1:16:48] now they're obvious to me - well
[1:16:51] hallelujah glory to God amen thank you
[1:16:55] Jesus it's not just preachers Church
[1:16:57] they got an answer it's not just
[1:16:59] preachers everybody's got an answer
[1:17:02] that's proven my Lot's wife God had to
[1:17:06] given her something but when the time
[1:17:08] for separation came to really start
[1:17:10] manifesting her mother gift right she
[1:17:12] had to have a mother's gifts she had
[1:17:13] daughters when it came time to really
[1:17:17] manifest that and separate from the
[1:17:19] world she didn't want to separate from
[1:17:20] the world and she's turned to a pillar
[1:17:23] of stone or Spiller salt looking back
[1:17:26] that's where my that's where my treasure
[1:17:28] is the treasure wasn't there the
[1:17:31] treasure was in Abraham's camp amen the
[1:17:33] promised son the coming said the Isaac
[1:17:38] are the type of rapture amen the body
[1:17:40] change amen that's where the treasure
[1:17:42] was at hallelujah I thought I'll just do
[1:17:46] a Bible study tonight oh yeah there you
[1:17:50] go pulling again that's good that's the
[1:17:52] way to do it
[1:17:55] see so this scripture proves an amen
[1:17:57] I've been texting a little bit about
[1:17:58] this over the months now we didn't talk
[1:18:00] about this tonight
[1:18:03] but whatever gift you have you got to
[1:18:06] give yourself full attention to that
[1:18:08] right you got to pour yourself into that
[1:18:11] he said give yourself wholly to it not
[1:18:13] partly wholly don't get part of your
[1:18:18] time to your gift give yourself wholly
[1:18:21] to it notice let me give you
[1:18:27] example you know when I first got the
[1:18:29] message that after I started pastoring I
[1:18:30] just needed a hobby and that was one
[1:18:33] reason I started doing the YouTube
[1:18:34] videos because I needed a hobby well I
[1:18:36] found out now is more of like a burden
[1:18:38] for outreach I called it a hobby at
[1:18:40] first cuz I just needed something to do
[1:18:41] in my extra time you know but and I like
[1:18:45] I like the technology I like doing
[1:18:47] videos and now the makeup videos got
[1:18:50] almost 240 thousand views on it there's
[1:18:55] almost 8000 subscribers and you know the
[1:18:59] testimonies are in the book they're
[1:19:00] people saying you saved my soul I fasted
[1:19:03] three days to know about makeup and
[1:19:05] there it is you pop up on my YouTube
[1:19:06] channel and now the book you know I'd
[1:19:09] spent a year and a half on that book and
[1:19:10] now one of the pastors about fifty
[1:19:13] copies one for every family in the book
[1:19:14] a couple pastors have done that they
[1:19:16] bought a copy forever in their in their
[1:19:17] book and so well I'm trying to see is
[1:19:19] that if I just focus on the Word of God
[1:19:21] teaching the Word of God that God will
[1:19:24] take that gift and multiply it and now
[1:19:26] the influence or the revelation God has
[1:19:29] given me I believe it's the right
[1:19:30] revelation can now go forth and it can
[1:19:33] speak and multiply and spread and the
[1:19:36] influence the fruit can be greater
[1:19:38] because all those things I wrote in
[1:19:40] there I already preached to you and
[1:19:42] hopefully the pastors will pick them up
[1:19:44] if there are things that I feel helpful
[1:19:45] and they can preach you their
[1:19:47] congregation and then hopefully that
[1:19:49] would be some fruit on the day on the on
[1:19:51] that day the day of hope by God's grace
[1:19:53] that's all I'm trying to say but see
[1:19:55] this this is what I try to apply this to
[1:19:59] my life give yourself wholly to it he
[1:20:01] ever give all your free time to focus on
[1:20:04] the gifts God given to you that they're
[1:20:06] profiting will appear to everybody all
[1:20:10] right so I'm just giving you a just a
[1:20:12] simple example in my life how I try to
[1:20:14] see that manifest in my life because
[1:20:19] listen church you know I'm sure Beatrice
[1:20:20] can say Amen and County cos Amen they
[1:20:23] you know you you say in a church long
[1:20:25] enough and you can see which people are
[1:20:27] really there and investing in the things
[1:20:28] of God right you can see the ones that
[1:20:31] are withering away but you can see
[1:20:37] people that are feeding and growing and
[1:20:39] and growing closer to God amen
[1:20:43] because they're profiting their their
[1:20:45] fruits appear to everybody everybody and
[1:20:50] I don't want to be one of those church
[1:20:52] members or pastors that it's getting
[1:20:53] hard and hard to preach
[1:20:55] well I can't preach tonight you know my
[1:20:57] stomach hurts from eating too much I
[1:20:58] can't do that you know well I didn't
[1:21:02] pray and study all week I don't have any
[1:21:04] revelation let's just play a tape play
[1:21:05] sit down it's okay to play from time to
[1:21:09] time I'm not condemning that what I'm
[1:21:10] saying is that we've got to invest in
[1:21:12] what God's called us to do
[1:21:13] be faithful and then the fruits and the
[1:21:15] profiting appears to everybody and I'm
[1:21:18] hoping that God shows you your gifts if
[1:21:20] you don't know your gifts already that
[1:21:22] God shows you them and you can focus on
[1:21:24] those I want you to have a narrow focus
[1:21:26] right I want you to have tunnel vision
[1:21:29] right I got one thing to do that's to
[1:21:31] serve my purpose to use the gifts God
[1:21:34] gave me and everything else I'll be I'll
[1:21:36] be like those Amish horses right with
[1:21:38] the blinders I'm not gonna see anything
[1:21:40] else outside that I'm just gonna see
[1:21:41] God's will for my life and I'm gonna do
[1:21:43] what God called me to do amen
[1:21:47] because your eyes are illuminated by
[1:21:49] Christ you can see now you're not a
[1:21:52] foolish person you know what God's got
[1:21:55] the gifts God giving you and your focus
[1:21:57] on those and you want to use those for
[1:21:59] God's glory I tell you hi Laura I'll say
[1:22:05] like this Lord haste the day when
[1:22:07] everybody in our church knows their
[1:22:09] gifts and then they're investing in them
[1:22:11] every week Oh Bob we're gonna have a
[1:22:14] real book of Acts search of Enter key Oh
[1:22:17] when easy the other ones and us older
[1:22:20] ones and all of us when we can get focus
[1:22:22] on the gifts God give and just think
[1:22:24] about that somebody's got to get the
[1:22:25] maracle's mine if they get dialed in and
[1:22:28] folk and they invest in miracles we're
[1:22:30] gonna see more miracles if it's God's
[1:22:33] season somebody's got to get the
[1:22:36] prophecy to say thus saith the Lord this
[1:22:38] is this is gonna happen next week or
[1:22:39] next year or get tell the body guys Bob
[1:22:42] think about that the blessings we could
[1:22:45] see but yeah how rarely has it happened
[1:22:47] in message churches because is everybody
[1:22:50] investing in their gifts or not
[1:22:52] mercy the last time we seen in here
[1:22:55] we're actually told something was mm I
[1:22:58] can't remember the year 2009 or 10 maybe
[1:23:04] 11 where the brother said thus saith the
[1:23:07] Lord
[1:23:07] some people are dying spiritually I went
[1:23:09] and asked the people out for that and
[1:23:10] three people said they were felt they
[1:23:11] were dying spiritually that was back at
[1:23:14] the other Waterloo place and I know at
[1:23:19] that time that brother was really
[1:23:20] investing in praying and the gift of
[1:23:21] tongues and interpretation his life he
[1:23:24] was really investing in that and that
[1:23:25] one hit exactly that was right on so see
[1:23:30] that's what I want you that you and I to
[1:23:31] do we got to be so focused on what God's
[1:23:33] called us to do that we can just also we
[1:23:37] can see in our life yeah I got to go to
[1:23:38] work I want to take care of my family oh
[1:23:40] but after that I just want to do what
[1:23:42] God is I don't invest in the gifts God's
[1:23:44] given me and mainly church that's just
[1:23:47] in prayer meditation you know and your
[1:23:49] free time you don't listen to look at
[1:23:51] other things you just try to zoom in and
[1:23:54] focus on what God's called you to do see
[1:23:58] there's one thing you need for your gift
[1:24:00] to work let's go to Daniel 2:16 there's
[1:24:02] one thing you need and I've already said
[1:24:05] it but let's read it anyway there's one
[1:24:08] thing you need Church for your gifts to
[1:24:10] operate Daniel 2:16 Daniel really needed
[1:24:19] his gift to operate or else
[1:24:20] Nebuchadnezzar was going to kill him so
[1:24:26] let's see what what does Daniel do when
[1:24:27] he's got lights life and death earlier
[1:24:29] well my liver died god I need you to
[1:24:32] show up what's one thing he asked for
[1:24:34] then Daniel went in and desired of the
[1:24:36] king that he would give him millions of
[1:24:38] dollars that he would show him that king
[1:24:40] the interpretation wasn't money Church
[1:24:42] it wasn't money Daniel said I need one
[1:24:46] thinking my life's on the line I need
[1:24:48] one thing I need time with God what do
[1:24:52] you need more of Trisha time with God I
[1:24:56] don't have to ask aren't to speak God
[1:24:59] and say well wonder what the people need
[1:25:00] it brought a Christ fellowship
[1:25:02] people need time with God when you're
[1:25:06] dedicated in prayer seeking God spending
[1:25:08] time your free times all about the Lord
[1:25:10] your Redeemer the time amen you brought
[1:25:14] it back there's one thing Daniel needed
[1:25:18] he said King give me time the King said
[1:25:20] sure I'll give you time
[1:25:21] let's see if this Holy Roller can get it
[1:25:23] and he sure did save his life and his
[1:25:28] three friends live amen
[1:25:30] glory that's what we want to do we would
[1:25:33] invest in our gifts to save lives to get
[1:25:36] people filled with the Holy Spirit to
[1:25:38] get people's eyes on the gospel think
[1:25:41] what God's called them to do it's one
[1:25:46] thing he needed to save his life
[1:25:48] time time with God that's why Paul says
[1:25:51] redeem the time be wise ah he could have
[1:25:54] went out he could have went to though he
[1:25:55] were could've went to somebody else to
[1:25:56] say help me guys help me he could went
[1:25:59] to anybody else but he said I needed but
[1:26:01] the real reality was I got to get alone
[1:26:02] with God and we get the answer to this
[1:26:06] this mystery God's gonna reveal the
[1:26:08] mystery to me yes glory God will reveal
[1:26:12] to you Church God will reveal all these
[1:26:16] mysteries to us we just humble ourselves
[1:26:18] all right let me said timer boy I'm
[1:26:20] gonna just forget about all that I'm not
[1:26:22] careful I'll forget about those promises
[1:26:24] I made to the Lord I don't want to I
[1:26:25] don't want to do that that's for sure I
[1:26:29] got numerous scriptures here but let me
[1:26:31] try to find a place to I might want it
[1:26:33] closed here so can everybody
[1:26:37] this all's Daniel needed was more time
[1:26:39] but how many know what was his testimony
[1:26:42] he was disciplined right
[1:26:44] he had his body he made his body pray
[1:26:47] how many times a day
[1:26:48] everybody knows three you'd have to
[1:26:51] wonder how many times of Daniel prayed a
[1:26:52] you knew because the Bible says so he
[1:26:55] was so disciplined he morning prayer
[1:26:58] above everything else
[1:27:00] he put noontime prayer above everything
[1:27:02] else when it came to evening he made
[1:27:05] sure evening prayer was more important
[1:27:07] than everything else did God make it God
[1:27:10] make everything else fit into his
[1:27:11] schedule yeah sure did how'd he know cuz
[1:27:15] heaven called him beloved that's how you
[1:27:16] know he said all day to the angels and
[1:27:20] all day and you'll greatly beloved of
[1:27:22] the Lord I had to wrestle 21 days but
[1:27:25] now your answers here amen God sent
[1:27:27] another angel Michael to help me up so I
[1:27:30] could answer your prayer heaven loves
[1:27:32] you heaven sent extra backup support to
[1:27:35] get me your answer amen hallelujah
[1:27:38] that's what we need we need backup
[1:27:40] support from angels amen
[1:27:42] but first let's have a disciplined life
[1:27:44] praise God
[1:27:45] first let's know what gifts have you
[1:27:48] given me god what on earth am I here for
[1:27:50] amen and let me invest in that so I can
[1:27:55] do something for your kingdom so know
[1:27:59] this a lot of this is review church but
[1:28:00] I wonder how many of us are living this
[1:28:02] right how many one live all this by
[1:28:04] God's good that's my heart's desire then
[1:28:06] I can count everything else is done it's
[1:28:10] all done it's awesome it's a it's all
[1:28:13] just evil it's all unpleasant anything
[1:28:17] from the world's unpleasant but what's
[1:28:19] pleasant to me is Christ and the gifts
[1:28:21] he's placed in my life
[1:28:26] remember church
[1:28:28] see a brother BAM said gets the greatest
[1:28:29] rebuke because they got slain not by
[1:28:34] evil rulers and getting their heads cut
[1:28:36] off but he said they got slain by riches
[1:28:39] and cares of this life can you imagine
[1:28:42] it and slain by riches and and cares of
[1:28:46] this life that's what killed your
[1:28:50] spiritual life oh I want to have more
[1:28:53] money I want to have an easier life and
[1:28:55] so you gave your full attention to those
[1:28:58] things and neglected the spiritual gifts
[1:29:00] God gave you and that's what Jesus
[1:29:02] rebukes them and has nothing good to say
[1:29:04] about this age because most people have
[1:29:06] sold out their gifts and they're gone
[1:29:08] after natural gifts money okay you know
[1:29:12] easy living soft living the convenience
[1:29:14] is luxuries in life and so Jesus said
[1:29:19] they get the worst rebuke and the early
[1:29:23] church you know they had to die for
[1:29:24] their faith and now look we we just got
[1:29:27] we can live however yeah we can live as
[1:29:28] close to God as we want
[1:29:29] we'd have to worry about losing our
[1:29:32] lives thank God for that we've got to
[1:29:35] make the most of a church I hope you
[1:29:37] want to make the most of it cannot
[1:29:42] forget that let's share something here
[1:29:45] for the sisters let's go to back to Luke
[1:29:47] 236 here you know we're a church with a
[1:29:49] lot of sisters and we appreciate that I
[1:29:51] thank the Lord I got a lot of sisters in
[1:29:53] my little house there God's will for us
[1:29:58] Luke 236 maybe God's gonna raise up some
[1:30:04] Myriam's around here with some
[1:30:06] tambourines and we'll have a sister's
[1:30:08] train of tambourine players and dancers
[1:30:10] are out here don't worry lots I'll take
[1:30:13] that amen I'll take that above a five
[1:30:16] girl basketball team any day of the week
[1:30:18] or a six six girl team volleyball team I
[1:30:23] could care less about that let's get
[1:30:25] those tambourine players and dancers
[1:30:26] amen
[1:30:28] hallelujah if it worked for Moses it'll
[1:30:32] work for us Laurie Luke 236 and there
[1:30:37] was one Anna a prophetess the daughter
[1:30:39] of Phanuel of the tribe of
[1:30:41] ah sure she was of a great age and had
[1:30:44] lived with a husband seven years from
[1:30:46] her virginity next thing and she was a
[1:30:49] widow about fourscore and 84 years old
[1:30:52] which departed not from the temple but
[1:30:54] served God with fasting and prayers
[1:30:56] night and day now Paul's right there
[1:30:57] so get it you know she lived very
[1:31:00] faithful to her husband so she was
[1:31:01] faithful to her family faithful to her
[1:31:04] husband who and her husband died she
[1:31:05] said fine God's taking that ministry
[1:31:07] from me now I'm gonna live at the house
[1:31:10] of God oh my how would we like that oh
[1:31:13] not tonight you don't believe you can
[1:31:16] just stay in the house of God and now
[1:31:19] her ministry went from family husband it
[1:31:22] went to God through prayer and fasting
[1:31:24] this is now her ministry did she give
[1:31:28] herself half-heartedly to it or did she
[1:31:30] give herself wholly to it holy
[1:31:34] you can say well I'll move a little
[1:31:37] closer to church now that's what that's
[1:31:38] actually good thing we could do Simon is
[1:31:40] trying to move closer to this church you
[1:31:42] know the scam church he's trying to sell
[1:31:44] his house now move closer that's a good
[1:31:45] thing sometimes I think about that too
[1:31:48] but I never you know I don't know how to
[1:31:50] pray about that don't really like our
[1:31:53] house but she said fine since God's
[1:31:58] God's finished
[1:31:59] God has closed this ministry and now
[1:32:01] I've got a different ministry and I'm
[1:32:04] gonna serve God with all I with all my
[1:32:06] heart
[1:32:06] and look how God blessed her her
[1:32:09] ministry was prayer and fasting just
[1:32:11] helping out the church helping out the
[1:32:12] church nothing fancy and you know there
[1:32:15] wasn't many people praying and fasting
[1:32:17] there's not many people praying and
[1:32:18] fasting today and if I wasn't many
[1:32:20] people praying and fasting then that's
[1:32:23] not the ministry like I got to tell
[1:32:24] people oh no we got plenty of people
[1:32:26] praying and fasting you don't worry
[1:32:27] about that
[1:32:28] right right Church we could use some
[1:32:32] ministries like that we could use some
[1:32:35] of that look at the next verse verse 38
[1:32:38] and she come
[1:32:40] in that instant gave thanks likewise and
[1:32:42] Lord and spake of him to all that looked
[1:32:44] for redemption in Jerusalem next
[1:32:45] scripture and when they had all
[1:32:48] performed all things according law of
[1:32:49] the Lord they returned to Galilee to
[1:32:50] their own City Nazareth now I must have
[1:32:52] missed it there because we know she got
[1:33:00] to see the Lord yeah she got to see the
[1:33:02] Lord before yeah I think she said that
[1:33:09] was Simeon okay simians yeah verse 25
[1:33:12] Simeon was the one who sees the the
[1:33:16] salvation of the Lord and here Anna
[1:33:20] yeah come Anna give thanks to the Lord
[1:33:21] the look for the redemption of Jerusalem
[1:33:23] so Simeon sees the Lord and then comes
[1:33:27] and said in other words this day the
[1:33:29] Scriptures fulfilled amen we see God's
[1:33:32] salvation salvation is here
[1:33:35] so all those prayers all those fastings
[1:33:37] God heard in heaven and they were
[1:33:39] building up to this moment and God used
[1:33:42] her as those second witness Simeon was
[1:33:45] the first witness
[1:33:46] and then God uses Anna as a second
[1:33:48] witness the salvation has come amen Oh
[1:33:51] hallelujah the church each day that we
[1:33:55] focus on our gift is just a building
[1:33:57] block when we talked about that on
[1:33:58] Sunday night each day you each time you
[1:34:01] obey God each day you serve God prayer
[1:34:03] fasting or just praying reading your
[1:34:04] Bible it's building a wall of separation
[1:34:06] amen
[1:34:07] it's building a law of character a wall
[1:34:10] a separation is keeping Satan out and
[1:34:13] keeping God in amen each each day of
[1:34:17] diligence is a wall you build up and
[1:34:19] pretty soon your characters protected
[1:34:21] behind the protection of God's grace
[1:34:23] amen I knew you and then God can use you
[1:34:27] in a great way like this look God can
[1:34:28] use her in a great way how many women
[1:34:31] didn't get to see the Messiah how many
[1:34:33] women laughed at Mary that day how many
[1:34:35] women blast him the Holy Ghost that day
[1:34:37] but because she was dedicated to prayer
[1:34:39] and fasting and knew a God Carter knew
[1:34:42] she not only gets to announce that
[1:34:44] salvation she gets to see the salvation
[1:34:46] of the Lord hey man let's say to our
[1:34:49] feet I better stop there I'll preach no
[1:34:51] longer here
[1:34:54] see she had the revelation because she
[1:34:57] was in her position and she read because
[1:35:00] she never gave up
[1:35:01] she knew what God's called me to fast
[1:35:04] now I know these other doors God has
[1:35:06] closed I don't of the family ministry
[1:35:08] anymore and now my ministries for prayer
[1:35:10] and fasting and because she was faithful
[1:35:13] all those years God let her see Jesus
[1:35:15] Christ God let her see that little
[1:35:18] Christ child the greatest gift that was
[1:35:20] ever on the face of the earth does that
[1:35:21] right Church God's God's wrapped gift
[1:35:25] amen hallelujah all because she was
[1:35:28] faithful she was diligent how they lujah
[1:35:35] how many want to redeem the time church
[1:35:37] I just feel burdened to stay on this
[1:35:40] because I want to see everybody whether
[1:35:43] you tell me or not I just want to see
[1:35:45] God vindicated that each person is
[1:35:47] investing in their gifts and then your
[1:35:49] your investment is seen by everybody now
[1:35:57] if you've got a
[1:35:58] ministry like praying and fasting like
[1:36:00] that then maybe just from time to time
[1:36:02] we'll see well soon you know of course
[1:36:03] we'll fee all your love for God but then
[1:36:05] from time to time you have a great merit
[1:36:07] core or great something or great
[1:36:08] testimony but each time you'll be here
[1:36:11] you just you're happy you're thankful to
[1:36:13] serve God you're hungry for more of God
[1:36:17] you're not battling am I saved or not am
[1:36:19] I filled with the Holy Ghost enough to
[1:36:21] buy cause you're you're earnestly every
[1:36:23] day you go down to prayer God renew me
[1:36:25] today make me fresh again today revive
[1:36:29] me today amen your earnest your diligent
[1:36:32] your giving all diligence to make
[1:36:34] everybody know which side you're on
[1:36:38] praise God
[1:36:39] you don't take days off you don't take
[1:36:41] weeks off serving God every day it's
[1:36:44] like Daniel every day I'm investing in
[1:36:46] this every day I know what God's calling
[1:36:49] me do how many know what God's call them
[1:36:51] to do
[1:36:51] may God revealed to us let's have the
[1:36:53] musicians come if you don't know may God
[1:36:55] reveal it to you you seek him with all
[1:36:58] your heart you'll find them see that's
[1:37:04] why you know I care so much about the
[1:37:06] house of God that's why I'm usually the
[1:37:08] first one here usually not tonight and a
[1:37:11] little fever you know the fever threw
[1:37:13] off everything at home usually I'm the
[1:37:16] first one here usually last one leave
[1:37:17] not always but why is that because I
[1:37:22] realized my my gift is here this is my
[1:37:25] gift I've got to invest and give
[1:37:28] everything I can give myself wholly to
[1:37:30] this and everybody can see that I'm
[1:37:32] profiting everybody can see that I'm
[1:37:35] dedicated to this I'm giving all my
[1:37:38] diligence to this I had this last
[1:37:47] thought I'll share Judas was condemned
[1:37:49] because he sold out the word for the
[1:37:51] world we've got to sell out the world
[1:37:53] for the word and we both have the
[1:37:57] highest calling he had the highest
[1:37:59] individual calling apostle there's no
[1:38:02] higher calling than that
[1:38:03] [Music]
[1:38:06] and that's why brother branham said
[1:38:07] people shudder when they hear Judas name
[1:38:09] because he had the highest calling in
[1:38:11] the Bible but he sold it out for money
[1:38:14] but thank God we can sell out the world
[1:38:17] and we have the highest calling for the
[1:38:19] church which is the bride of Jesus
[1:38:20] Christ praise God hallelujah
[1:38:27] it's okay if I'm not an apostle as long
[1:38:30] as I'm his wife
[1:38:32] because he's the priest an apostle of
[1:38:35] our faith I just want to be married to
[1:38:37] that high postulate she's not that's the
[1:38:43] battle the battle is always gonna be are
[1:38:44] you giving all your diligence are you
[1:38:46] selling out the world are we selling out
[1:38:49] our calling if you buy something you got
[1:38:54] to give it up we've got to give up our
[1:38:55] free time we got to give up whatever is
[1:38:58] taken away from us investing in our
[1:39:01] gifts give ourselves wholly to God's
[1:39:08] Word that are profiting they appear
[1:39:11] before all let's bow our heads I'm not
[1:39:12] going to even you look around but just
[1:39:14] in your heart you don't to raise your
[1:39:15] hand but how many would say Lord as
[1:39:17] you're whispering a prayer lord help me
[1:39:20] to sell out everything that I can invest
[1:39:22] and give myself wholly to the gifts you
[1:39:25] give me how many would in your heart say
[1:39:26] yes Lord that's my desire my hands are
[1:39:30] up
[1:39:33] the church I understand my mind is
[1:39:36] probably the easiest to see just cuz
[1:39:37] that's the nature of the job
[1:39:39] pastors up there every every week every
[1:39:42] service he's up there that's the nature
[1:39:44] everybody can see mine but yours is just
[1:39:49] as important how many believe that your
[1:39:51] gift is just as important as mine
[1:39:54] buh-bam said every believer should be
[1:39:57] just as interested in their gift in
[1:39:59] being positioned in the house of God as
[1:40:01] the pastor is it is good let's have a
[1:40:08] word of Prayer Heavenly Father you saw
[1:40:09] the hearts that were lifted I I didn't
[1:40:11] ask the hands benefit tonight but the
[1:40:14] heart's a simple message kind of review
[1:40:16] but all I hope that people can catch the
[1:40:18] inspiration behind it the Lord if we can
[1:40:23] just focus on our gifts invest in our
[1:40:26] gifts
[1:40:29] and our calling in life then the
[1:40:33] profiting will be seen by all the church
[1:40:37] members and of course our family and
[1:40:40] friends as well if we can just give
[1:40:42] ourselves so what you've called us to do
[1:40:48] so will I pray if your people here if
[1:40:51] they don't know your will may they seek
[1:40:53] you today find it may they get in their
[1:40:55] prayer closet as Jesus said may they
[1:40:58] give some time to it one thing that
[1:41:02] you'll need in time that's one thing we
[1:41:05] need to do is to make the time we need
[1:41:08] to get it all with God may your people
[1:41:12] get alone with you in Jesus Christ's
[1:41:13] name but they can know the gifts know
[1:41:18] the calling know the hope of their
[1:41:20] calling and invest in those gifts for
[1:41:25] God oh that's my desires and creature as
[1:41:32] I said that Lord when we answer on that
[1:41:34] day each member of our church can can go
[1:41:37] before you and say Lord I knew it you
[1:41:39] called me to do our best the gifts
[1:41:40] here's the fruits of the labors and
[1:41:43] you'll say well done good and faithful
[1:41:45] servant you've invested in your gift and
[1:41:49] here's the reward back
[1:41:51] he said well done entering the joys of
[1:41:53] the kingdom prepared for you from the
[1:41:55] foundation of the world we don't want a
