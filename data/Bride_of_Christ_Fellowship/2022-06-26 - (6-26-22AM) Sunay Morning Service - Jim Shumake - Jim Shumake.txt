TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i want to send greetings from the church in albion and then uh before we left i can't remember several several people come and said please greet the church there for us and i know one comes to mind the last guy i talked to went out brother brian hawking or not brother brian hawkins brother brian cross and said make sure you tell jesse and we all said hello amen and a different one many different ones that please greet the church for so we send our greetings from the church there in albion just a little group and they have a big gun among them and uh told jesse i surely don't feel worthy to be here this morning of all the great ministers that he could have come i feel kind of like i'm the i'm like brother graham said that tire with the least tread on it it's kind of like the old spare tire amen and i'm not an evangelist that can shout you and make the shout and jump and run all over the church that's just not my my type of ministry i uh i i do feel that the lord has called me to pastor a little flock there and sometimes you know as a as a patcher it's kind of like a daddy and you kind of kind of do a little daddy working and so brother jesse i'm not trying to be a daddy to your you go ahead brother go ahead and preach preach what god places on the heart yes i do count the privilege again to be among you this morning pray that god would just use something i say bless you just help if you can just help one person yes but it comes past my lips oh god i pray lord god that you would do that this morning so you have your bibles if you would turn with me this morning two places i'd like to read again i'm not a great revelative preacher i listen to your pastor often on the on the youtube i always tell everybody you know everybody has to have a pastor so pastors need a pastor too so i go and get a little from jesse and a little from this one from that one and uh and i just appreciate the teaching i don't i'm not a great teacher like he is but i do appreciate the gift that god has placed in him and i know you're not to try to be anybody else just stay in the calling for this morning some great teaching i'm not going to try to be an evangelist because that's not what god called me right right i'm just going to pasture a little bit if i could amen glory i mean that might not be a thing for special meetings but uh that's just what god has placed in yourself hallelujah and by god grace there's something that said psalms 19 i want to start at the seventh verse and i'll say first peter chapter 4 to read verse 7. psalms 19 verse 7 first peter four verse seven how it is i'm in your spot you're looking for this thing trying to get them all down so i'll just give you a few moments to find the scripture amen pray something said this morning be a real blessing to you amen i'm not known well i don't think i'm a long-winded creature my wife smiles when i say that i'll try not to be too long-winded this morning by god's grace and psalm chapter 19 verse 7 they have this amen amen amen psalm chapter 19 verse 7 the law of the lord is perfect converting the soul the testimony of the lord is sure making wise the symbol amen the statutes of the lord are right rejoicing the heart the commandment of the lord is pure enlightening the eyes oh i'm so glad to have my eyes in life amen the fear of the lord is clean enduring forever the judgment i want to look at this word the judgments of the lord are true and righteous all together nobody likes to be judged but they're true god judged that's true they're righteous they work righteously beautifully more to be desired are they than gold yay more than fine gold sweeter than the honey and the honeycomb yes moreover by them thy servant warned and in keeping them there is great reward who can understand his errors cleanse thou me from my secret fault nobody has any of them do we this is david's christ he's crying out the lord cleanse me from my secret fault right right brother back thy servant also from presumptuous sins wonderful let them not have dominion over me then shall i be upright and i shall be innocent from the great transgression let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight o lord my strength and my redeemer amen like this on the on the board sometimes people won't turn because it's on the boards and i like to i kind of wear my old bible out that's right but i mean i turned the pages because i like to hear those pages turning hey man i got my wife of kendall one time she said it's it's good i can read a book on the kindle but it's just not like turn another page that's right i feel that way about the bible amen first peter 4 verse 7 but the end of all things is at hand how may i say amen amen be there for sober and watch unto prayer let's pray one more time heavenly father as we gather here this morning lord god i pray lord something will be said it would just make us amen just a little bit closer to you we ask lord god that you would help us each one to apply the word and let it have a practical outworking in our lives or god amended it might correct the air that we find in our own lives lord god and father help us amen that we don't amen make the mistakes that that this whole flesh would sometimes get us into father we pray this morning that you would have your way among us amen that your perfect word would come forth jesus one of our hearts lord i love you everybody among these who can commit once again this time these people in your hands in jesus name pray amen amen amen you're all right if i just take this off yes sir there's a hook right there on the side usually that's the first thing i do when i get ready listen i don't like to fight with the code man we're fighting the devil this morning that's right all right amen now what we find here in the story i want to preach a little thought this morning if i could on the prayer for deliverance from presumptuous sin prayer for deliverance from presumptuous sins amen and david here is crying out the psalmist and i believe it's david he's crying out here and um he's crying out that god would hold him back from sin i'm gonna cry how many have ever cried that crying lord god hold me back from sin don't let me forget about sin you know sometimes amen we find ourselves um kind of confident in the fact that well i'm a holy ghost-filled believer you know i got the holy spirit i mean i'm not going to sin i'm not going to say it but you know david was filled with the holy ghost from the very time that samuel anointed him amen he began to move under the spirit of god begin to move upon him and direct him and he was a man the bible says after god's own heart he was chosen right right of god just like a true believer of god is chosen elected predestinated from before the foundation yes to stand in this day yes yes with the word of god in an anointed with the spirit of god amen the holy ghost upon the same man but yet we find david in that position we find david gets himself in a terrible trouble that's right brother right david gets himself amen with bathsheba and we find out that he had a lot of problems and the problems never left his house because of the sin that david found himself in that's right to i would never do something like that that's probably exactly what david thought that's right but you know what i don't want i don't want to presume like david did that i'll never do that i'm going to presume that i'll never have a problem i don't want to ever get so so uh confident in myself that word presumption means to be proud or or too arrogant and brazen or or overconfident that i'll think oh i'll never do something like that right i got confidence i can do this i can do anything i want i can get myself in a position like david got himself and i'm strong enough not to fall like david did right look out look out church right but yet we see you know we see the the bride of christ excuse me we see this bride of christ get to the position that because we got the holy ghost because god has revealed his word to us because we know so much of the word of god we get to think well glory to god i'm invincible i'm i'm bulletproof i'll never make a mistake right it's like a man who's been an alcoholic they may go into a bar he mean don't do it don't do it god has delivered you from alcohol god has developed you from whatever it don't get around that thing don't think that you're strong enough because you're not amen right amen david thought he was strong enough and found himself in a bunch of trouble that's right but we find david here david found himself in trouble but then god sent a prophet of god with the word of god he said nathan to david and he told a little parable about a lamb and a man a headlamp you know the story amen and in telling that story maybe david got furious he couldn't believe that someone would do something like that something so terrible if it is to take this other man they have to kill and just do it without any without any pity or anything yes but yet david got so angry that he said that man deserves to die right and nathan just turned and he said you're the man you're that name you're that man david and immediately david's heart sank immediately david knew what david had david had some secret faults according to psalms here he said moreover by their judgments i i know my secret faults amen he was judged by the word of god the word of god always come to the prophet god said the word amen to nathan or today david through nathan the prophet he said the word to him and it was a word of judgment he found himself judged by the word you're the man david you're desire and very stood like well i would never do such a thing i mean how many say that i would never do such a thing in your heart you're saying that right but church you're not strong enough in yourself i'm not strong enough in myself not to give in to this old sticky carnal nature that the prophet god said we're stuck in that's right yes now i'm not i'm not picking on anyone maybe like i said i don't have an evangelist ministry i have a pastoral ministry and i don't want to see presumptuous sin make their way in among my sheep amen among jesse's sheep that's right amen i'm old you can tell i use paper i don't have one of those i don't have my little legs it would scare me my son bought me one said dad you won't have to do all that paper stuff and i said well what would i do if i get up here and touch the wrong thing i do that on my phone turn that thing up i don't presume i'm smart enough to use one of those keep me back from thinking i am lord that's right so i put it on paper hey man that's good that all right yes sir yes i'm old man amen i'm proud of it that's not a good thing don't be proud but anyhow we find david here we find himself in this position amen where he finds himself judged and he's crying out here in psalms he says oh the fear of the lord is is clean enduring forever the judgments of our lord are true and righteous all together he's thanking god that he found himself judged yes hallelujah that's right and when we read over in first corinthians let a man we take when we take communion we read this verse in our church and now you might probably do here too he said let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that couple we're taking the communion yes see if david would examine his own heart he would have realized that where he was going wasn't right and then but he didn't yes he just presumed well i'm the king i would never do anything wrong and he was walking he would he was looking at something you should have been looking at that's right yes is that right yes sir church event there's a there's a host of things in this world today that you can look at did you want not to be looking at him hallelujah you know you think well i'm i'm strong enough to look at that thing that doesn't affect me that's a lie yeah right right the devil it will affect you hey man amen look at those things get those things off your computer get those things off your telephone whatever what it is don't be looking at those things presuming that you're strong enough to overcome them because you're not all right the only way that you can overcome that is the power of the holy ghost in you that'll overcome and throw this old sticky carnal nature subject to it amen to that hallelujah am i the only one that ever struggles anything with this old nature david just said i had some secret fault but when you judge me i found myself judged i thank god for your judgment amen yeah that's exactly what paul was saying the corinthians he says for he that he is to drink unworthy and drink of damnation unto himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you listen to what he said next four if we would judge ourselves we would not have to be judged he wouldn't have to send the word of god and condemn me like he did david amen that's right but he said but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world if you're a son of god god is going to judge you he's going to bring you under the judgment of the word of god if you're a predestinated son of god david couldn't fall he was predestinated amen amen but he still fell amen if he'd judged himself he wouldn't but god set the judgment because he loved him so he wouldn't be condemned with the world amen we would judge ourselves but when we are judged we're chastened to the lord that's why david said all those judgments are more to be desired than fine gold that's right they're sweeter than hunting from the cold because it kept me amen for being judged they may have found them unworthy because god judged me by his word he sent the prophet the word of god amen and he told me you're the man david yes you're the one and david finds it that we find david himself here cried out oh lord god amen hold me back from the presumption of the sins yes david realized then that he couldn't hold himself back david realized then that i thought that i had the power not to not to enter into these things but when i felt like he started to cry out lord should be the cry of each and every one of us this morning lord god hold me back yeah yeah i got secret faults i got this hold me back don't let me get into those things amen amen you may want to be held back this morning yes jesus how they're doing the way it delivers that we access that way the power of god through prayer amen just like david cried out and prayed unto god hallelujah he said well brother jeff they said i got the holy ghost i've been baptized i've been baptized in the water i've been baptized i've trusted in the blood of jesus christ amen don't get overconfident that's right so is david filled with the holy ghost amen don't get overconfident over the first corinthians we find paul saying this he said moreover brother i would not have you should be ignorant how that our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea he says and our and we're all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea you know what brother ram said that red sea was the type of blood they were all baptized amen they all were trusted in the blood and they all passed through the seed yes they all ate the same spiritual meat they all drank the same spiritual drinks but they drank that spiritual rock that followed them that rock was pride they were all feeding on the word of god they were all baptized they made they'd all trusted in the blood they'd all come through the red sea amen that's right that's right these are sons and daughters of god have been predestinated to inherit the promised planning that's right yes yes sir but paul said but with many of them god was not well pleased they were overthrown in the wilderness yes don't get to this place that you think you can't be overthrown yes don't get to the place well i'm i'm i'm safe i don't have i would never do those things and paul ryan is in the next words paul says in first corinthians 10 60 says now these things were are examples to the intent that we should not lust after evil yes they fail and god give us an example of it so that we wouldn't find ourselves lusting after evil things and falling in the same way they did yes amen wherefore let him thicket instead take heed lest he fall all right yes amen don't get so comfy you think well bless god amen you know how many have ever come off a good high been filled with the holy ghost and just enjoy it and just shout in the glory and hallelujah oh i feel so [Music] i mean i feel so brother brown said he said oh don't you just feel all cleaned out and scrubbed out in it how many likes to feel that amen don't get so confident in that that you don't think that devil can say oh well i can't bother him no more he will be right there the next day that's right right there the next day right amen you're gonna dangle that bait in front of you again yes and you know what you're not strong enough not to take the bait that's right brother that's why we need the holy ghost absolutely positively essential that we have that holy spirit amen amen he said these things were our examples that we wouldn't lost everything so therefore let him take heed lest he fall in when you think you can stand take heed unless you fall amen amen hallelujah and then the next words very familiar scriptures first corinthians 10 36 4 there have no temptation taking you but such is as common to man every temptation that you face it's common every man every woman every boy every girl they all face yes how many know jesus was tempted in all manner just like we were amen every man just like we were but yet he had the holy ghost to anchor inside that could keep him that's right no temptation he was such as common to man but god is faithful or aren't you glad for a faithful god who will not suffer you to be tempted about that which you're able but with the temptation make a way of escape that you may be able to bear it yes that way of escape has been made david found that way of escape when he was tempted when he failed amen he cried out unto god church he but there is a prayer of faith that will believe for the believer that we can call unto the god and know that he'll deliver us this morning amen amen hold me back lord god yes jesus be sober and watch under prayer the end of all things is at hand and then there was david a man after god there was david full of the holy ghost for the time of solomon and david found himself amen giving in he thought he got too cocked sure of himself oh bless god i'll never fall right but look what happened yeah yes these were given for our examples that we wouldn't lust and do this and have these same desires i mean because this old flesh amen it longs for the things of this world that's right it does yeah and the only way to have victory over this old flesh is to have something on the inside hallelujah okay that's why you know the word of god says be filled with the spirit amen yeah he doesn't say it it doesn't mean just one time right lord god fill me every day amen [Applause] david was a man after god's own heart the bible says anointed to be king amen in acts 13 we can find this written he said he raised up david to be their king to whom he gave this testimony and said i have found david the son of jesse a man of after my own heart that will fulfill my will amen that man that god bragged on that god said i found in him a man that will fulfill that will do my word amen that man fell yes the church amen you might be a man of god you might be a woman of god here this morning you might be filled with the holy ghost and god has predestinated you according to but don't think i mean that you can get so sure of yourself that you don't need to pray lord god hold me back hold me back every day i need to be held back every day man i don't even want to think that i'm big enough to hold myself back but there is one who is this morning all right thank you jesus my old church knows i love charles spurgeon and i i study some of spurgeon's writings and and you know what's amazing from the brand i've even heard brother brandon mentioned charles spurgeon anymore wow i mean and when i study spurgeon's writing it's amazing to me how many times spurgeon comes back and says the same thing brother brandon did or maybe brother branham says something he said right now i know a lot of people will condemn you who want to study somebody's telling the message amen the church i i find sometimes i hear a minister say something's not a message princess well that was really good that's right that's right brother that's really good you know i i can see the minute they go off this way yeah well that's fine amen but i'll just throw the pit out and i'll make this part right and he was talking about this this portion of scripture in the 19th psalm where david is crying out keep me back keep me back from presumptuous sins he says he said this was a prayer i'm not i'm just going to read what he said he said this is a prayer a prayer of a man after god's own heart amen if holy david needed to pray like this sanctified david needed to pray how much more do we need to pray like this yes yes he says oh yeah he said he said keep me back he said he was saying or prying this out when you read the song he was crying it out he said so much to say he says hold me back he says or i shall rush headlong and i said over the precipice of sin that's right hold me back lord because if you don't i know i know this oh man he'll run headlong inside and be destroyed amen how much more do we need to pray that way yes hallelujah he said our evil nature is like an ill-tempered horse and it's apt to run away how many have ever rode a horse when i was a boy we had a horse we wanted a horse so bad we had that oh daddy can we have a horse no no horse they eat a lot of hay and all that we had farm we had cows we had pigs and all this but we figured we ought to have a horse so us children saved our allowances and we saved our money and we bought a horse 14 horse back when i was that day that was a lot of money right but we bought this horse and we brought it home his name was jerry sounds like a pretty innocent name doesn't it but we were looking at the paperwork on this horse the next day dad said this had been white it out so he scratched the white out or whatever it was it was on the name part of the paperwork there and underneath it said fury he didn't say jerry it said fury it wasn't a gentle kid pony this was a this was a fury wow he had a he had an ill temper i guess just like our old physical nature that's right brother good he said it's apt to run away and the first day we got on that horse that's exactly what it did oh i gotta hold the range i can i can control this now kill tempered horses you just watch he took me for a ride and he finally unloaded me my older brother said well yeah well get me on him i'll show you and he got on the horse and he said he showed him and he got loaded just a little bit about the same place i did but my dad was standing there oh thank god for my he was a big man he said oh i'll teach that horse a thing or two he got on that horse and that horse took him across the field just as tight as he took me and my brothers and all the way across my dad is speaking that horse it wasn't nice things he was saying to him whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa and he finally in order to get the horse stopped he grabbed the whole horse's bed he pulled the horse's head clear around here and he flipped the horse over on its side to get the horse horse's stuff i said dad what we're going to do we spent all our money on this horse and that said i have i have a solution for that ill-tempered horse how many have ever seen a bit on a horse oh boy i'm hoping everybody raised their hand but you know when you when you put a bit in the horse's mouth there's two levers that come down on the bed and and that hits in the horse's mouth and when these levers are pulled by the reins this bit has a little what they call a port it's a little sometimes it's a roller and if it's a real nice horse it's not ill-tempered voice like our nature is it doesn't have to be too big of a hump in that bit but the horse that we were riding just had a little bit of rise in the bit because it's called for a soft mouth horse we aren't soft mouth nature that's right all right we have an ill-tempered nature right right we'll run away with this if we don't if we don't have some help but my dad went out the next day or the next week or whatever it was and he bought what they call a high port bit and that bit doesn't just have a little rise that bit has a big rise like this and so when you put it out horse's mouth and you pull those levers that high port vent comes up on the top of that horses now that mouth is real tender on a horse and when that bit rolls up there it gets their attention real quick and then we did dad put that bit on that horse he said try them now and then i said whoa and pulled them raised back that bit come up amen and it was so high that it reached up there and could touch the places that needed touched amen i'm so glad we had a higher power that we could go to a higher power that could control this whole nation a higher power if it'll bring it under control amen amen that's what we need father because you know what my father gave me the power to control that horse our father has given us the power because holy spirit the higher power if we'll just access it through the worst form of sin which was done with deliberation and willfulness when david cried out and hold me back from those presumptuous sin he willfully went and did what he did knowing that it wasn't right that's right but his old carnal nature was like that ill-tempered word i'm going to satisfy my old nature right it's a strong thing right that's why we need a higher power that's why he said david did this in willful deliberate sin amen and he said even the holiest of people even the most holy ghost-filled people need to be kept back from the violence of transgressions that's right now i'm not here brother jesse i'm not here i pray to god that you've got you don't have these kind of problems but you know what i can see in my own life in my life i see it in my church amen where we stumble and fall we make mistakes and then we'll feed only access to higher power read your bible and pray every day pray without ceasing it's the will of god concerning you amen amen amen amen nobody believes that amen even the holiest need to be kept back from transgressions yes it's a solemn thing that we read the apostle paul warning he's not warning sinners but over in colossians the third chapter of the book of colossians he's born in saints i'll read this to you yes over in colossians chapter 3 verse 1 we read these words if ye then be risen with christ seek the things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god set your affections on things above and not on things of the earth for you are dead and your life is hid with christ in god when christ who is our life shall appear then shall we also appear with him and glory who's david taught or who is paul talking to he's talking to saints yes he's talking to saints of god he's talking to born again raised with christ amen your life the old man dead you're hidden with christ amen yes but what's the very next thing that the apostle paul warns these people mortify therefore your members yes which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil computations amen covetousness which is idolatry for which things say the wrath of god cometh upon the children of distal people yes yes amen born again christians saved people i mean these aren't sinners out there he's warning them to mortify to put to death these things in your life you've got to get them under subjection of the holy ghost amen hallelujah amen yes they'll cause the wrath of god to come upon the children to disobey god's word willfully amen just to satisfy this old flesh oh brother jim i'd never do that hey man that's what they thought too but paul do different yeah right and paul warned against these things the most loathsome of sins mortified therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication i'm thinking get those things put to death that's right yes i like what spurgeon says what do saints need this kind of warning against these kinds of sins yes yes david thought they did yes church i know they do why because i have stumbled i've failed i've done things that i wish i hadn't done amen yeah i might have just judged myself by the word of god i would say wait a second don't go there don't look at that don't let those tempt you amen don't satisfy you know and it's not just these little sins that we we look or the sins that we talk about but there's these little things that oh some people feel good if they know the latest thing that's going on they can't wait to tell you about it brother justin that's right right brother you know what we call it we call that gossip yes but you know what it satisfies this old flesh or they wouldn't do it that's right let me tell you about what i found out about it and not only lydia but her sister too maybe you're gonna wonder right right with that you know what you're making somebody feel good that you think you know something you know what i mean that's a loathsome thing and god god hates that amen yeah amen it shows discord among the brethren amen yes i don't know anything about lydia but i think she's a fine young lady done a great job with his children and i thank god for him he's always a blessing amen he said but we find out amen there's these things that we need to be held back from amen and not just those not just these loathsome purple sins amen that christians find themselves in you know what we find when god says don't do this or don't do that we have the word of god on things that the prophet god has told us amen that will make us amen sons and daughters of god or give us victory in our walk with god and we find ourselves compromising on those things just because this whole flesh wants to be saved that's right brother right it makes me feel good if if a boy looks at me when i have you shouldn't those things those things will creep in that's right brother i don't want to get off into that i'd like to maybe speak on that tonight amen do sage keep warning against these things yes they do the most holy ghost-filled people amen i like how he puts this he said the widest robes unless their purity is preserved by divine grace will be defiled by the blackest spots of sin that's right the most i don't care how holy you are man the moment you take your eyes off of god and start putting your trust like david did its own self and then you're going to fall that's right right brother he said experienced christians don't boast of your experience yes hallelujah the moment you look away from god and then the one who's able to keep them from falling you'll surely fall the most those who had the most fervent love whose faith is constant whose hope is bright don't ever say i'll never sing we have a saying in our house it was a little cartoon that kids used to watch him in don't ever say never don't ever say no because the moment you do amen the devil's going to put you to the test that's right never say never amen don't ever say we never shall sin but rather we need to cry out like david oh lord god hold me back amen deliver me from temptation hold me back lord i can't hold amen amen you say old brother jim i would never do that i would never get myself in a situation like david did i like what spurgeon says here he said there is enough tinder in the heart of the best man to light a fire that will burn to the lowest hell unless god shall quench the sparks as they fall many knows what tinder is i asked that question home what what's tinder you might know what tinder is a lot of kids i said well when we were kids we used to always camp out and have a campfire all summer long we camped out and we always had a campfire so in order to start the campfire in order to start a fire i mean you had to find something that was we called it tinder i mean or something that would light and burn real quick or real easy and if you weren't near the barn where there was some straw or something hey that worked great grill dry and put that in the firewood doesn't burn long but boy it burns hot and bursts fast right you know what it does it catches other things on fire it catches the bigger things on fire yes and i said tinder amen and i gave a test to my grandson the very next week we had a campfire and i said the best tinder we could find is kids with golden rods old dried out golden rod tell me what a gold medal is we get these old goldenrod weeds they grow up and they get dry and so we bust them up in a little bit chunks like that throw them in a fire minute you put a little paper match to it they were on fire he said that is something that will start a fire real quick yes he says there's enough tinder in the heart of any man no matter how old he is to start a fire that will burn to the lowest of death that's right don't think oh i can do this i can play i can mess around with this fire and not get burned i mean it will start a fire you can't put out don't look at what you shouldn't look at don't go where you shouldn't go amen right yeah they don't associate where you shouldn't associate it it'll cause a fire that you can't put out i mean i don't care how holy you think you are david was the whole man after god's own heart and then the fire burned out of control before he could stop it amen amen it's like trying to start a campfire in a barn i mean don't think you can do it when we were kids we thought well it's raining out we're camping out let's let's go in the barn and have our campfire in there and dad said i'll murder you start a fire in the barn you can't keep the fire from spreading to the whole barn and that's exactly what it does when you start messing with these things these little lusts of the flesh of it it'll burn a fire that you can't put out yes sir yes sir hallelujah and you're not strong enough to put it out that's why david had to call upon the one who was debating he accessed it the power to be delivered from presumptuous sin through prayer prayed out oh god deliver me amen keep me back from these presumptuous seeds another scripture i don't know where it went but david said you know when he was in that position when he didn't have those secret faults in it the bible says he just he just hated himself the whole time he was but god judgment coming brought him out of that he prayed to god and god delivered him amen amen i'm not saying if you have if you've allowed those sins to or something to come into your life or an old habit or whatever it might be if there's not hope for you amen there is amen yes amen but it's through prayer access and the one god is able to deliver hallelujah he said there's enough tinder he said unless god would put it out who would have dreamed that lot would be found drunken committing uncleanness that's right that's right brother i'm saying righteous love his righteous soul was vexed by the things he saw going on downstairs all that time that's right we find that man amy caught with presumptuous yes sir so don't think that oh i'm stronger stronger that's right good you find a man by the name of hazel he's crying out to god one day he said am i a dog and i would do such a horrible thing that the prophet told you everybody's going to do i would never see it amen azio was a man who elijah had anointed to be king over syria if you read in the bible says in first kings 19. hazel was anointed to be king over israel the prophet of god had come and anointed him yes yes sir but yeah we find hazel getting the same way david did getting kind of sure of himself oh i would never do these things you find the story over the second king's eighth chapter i'm gonna pick it up the seventh verse he said and elijah came to damascus and benedict i might not have these i might not pronounce these names right i can only tell when i say one wrong sometimes somebody that knows how to pronounce it then haddad the king of syria was sick he was told him saying that the man of god has come hither and the king said to hazel and then here's the guy take a present in that hand and go meet the man of god and inquire of the lord by him saying shall i recover of this disease so hazel went to meet him he took the president his hand even a good thing of damascus 40 camels burned with all these goods to perform the sun and said my son benedict king of syria has sent me to thee saying shall i recover of this disease and elijah said unto him go say unto him thou may have certainly recovered however the lord has shown me that you will die yeah you're going to recover you can recover this this disease this sickness sure you're good but he says you're going to die on what does that mean now listen and hazel said and and and it settled his countenance steadfastly until he was ashamed and the man of god wept and hazel said why are you weep lord what are you what are you crying about and he answered he said because i know the evil that thou will do unto the children of israel their strongholds will thou set on fire their young men will thou slay with the that will dash their children rip up their woman and child with child and hazel said but what is thy servant a dog i would never do such a thing i would not have never felt i would never do such a thing all right see i would i served a dog that should do such a great thing elijah said the lord has shown me that thou shalt be king over syria so he departed from elijah and came to his master and said unto him what said elijah to thee and he said he told me that you're surely going to recover and he came to pass on the world that he took a thick cloth dipped it in water spread it on his face so that he died and hazel reigned instead i would never am i a dog that i would do such a thing that you said i would do and he did exactly what the prophet said he would do you know what hazel should have been crying when the moment the prophet and god judged him like david found himself until he said oh hold me back lord don't let me do such a vowel all right amen i can't do it myself oh my dog i would never sin and no you will hey man you'll fall the moment you take your eyes off the one is able to keep amen brother jim i got the holy ghost i would never do it hazel said the same thing but you know what we know different and every one of us has been filled with god's spirit we've been walking in this world very long knows every one of us knows that we have this old sticky carnal nature that we must deal with every day and you're not strong enough to deal with amen paul said it like this over in romans the seventh chapter how many ways paul had the holy ghost amen how many believe paul was used mightily of god amen you know what paul struggled with his old flesh just like you and i yeah he still had the same problem just like you and i do he said in romans the seventh chapter the 14th verse for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal soul under sin for that which i do i allow not and for that which i would that do i not but that which i hate that i do what you do he's having a struggle with his old flesh man i would say a man nobody ever had that struggle yes then if i do that which i would not i consent under the law that is good now there is no more me to do it but it's sin that dwelleth in me wait a second this is a man filled with the holy ghost from the day that and i have laid hands on him amen right for we know that in me that is in my flesh there dwelleth no good thing for me to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i don't find how i can't do another word i can't do what's right in myself right i can't do it on my own fleshly health and i can't control this old man amen that's right for the good that i would i do not and even which i would not that i do now if i do that which i would not throw more me than do with it but it's sin that dwelleth in me i find that law that it that when i would do good evil was present with me before i delight in the law of the lord after the inner man amen how many knows were two men here he said i delighted delight in the word of god i'm a man of god amen yes but yet i find this old flesh man you've been bringing me down but i see another law in my memory that's in this old flesh that's why the word of god says this mortify the deeds yes wonderful mortified those members which are upon the earth this whole fleshly man i see another law in my members mortify that law in your member put that thing to death amen you can't do it it's stronger than you are you need to cry out to prayer you need to access the holy ghost who's more than able to do it hallelujah let's see another law and i remember war gets the law in my mind bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my mind now listen oh wretched man that i am yes yes no not old king david that i am or oh hazy owl the great prophet that i ever know oh wretched man that i am he had your right attitude i'm a wretched man and myself i have no good in myself i need to accept the one who's able to keep my eyes who shall deliver me from this body of death i thank god through jesus christ the way the holy spirit is and we have access to that way by prairie man we have a prayer that will deliver us from presumptuous sins hallelujah nobody believes that this morning yes amen how many got the holy ghost this morning don't be afraid to say you're redeemed let the redeemed of the lord say so if you've got the holy ghost don't get so confident in that fact that god has blessed you with that but you think that you can hold yourself back it takes that holy ghost to do it hallelujah hallelujah oh wretched man that i am david cried out paul the prophet of god said let me just kind of polish up with what david or what paul was trying to say here this is a message from question and answer 1964. is it okay to read questions yes brother brown said this let me just kind of polish this up here so it said what david tried to say he said in me is two persons now this one person wants to do wrong the other wants to do right and every time i start to write that wrong guy hinders me he says how many how many how many people have ever had that same problem he said how many people in the interviews this morning run into that same thing yes yeah i said well both my hands were went there how many have ever had that problem yeah i'm busy man all right he says you're an outward man which is controlled by six senses you're an inward man controlled by one sense and that sense is faith he said now as long as the sixth senses agree with faith or the revelation of the word he said that's wonderful he said but when these six sentences disagree with faith then leave the sixth senses alone when these extensive disagree with the revelation that the spirit of god has given you with the word it may then leave these six senses that are governing this old flesh leave them alone amen mortify those things put them to death amen they'll cause your problem hallelujah now that's the same thing with paul speaking here it was sold under the law to carnal sin but every one of us is the same way he said that's the reason we have the troubles that we do he says of our marriage four or five times this in that this that the other thing all kinds of sin and adulteries and everything else going along in our lives because of those things excuse me we are carnal on that part must according to the word of god be mortified that part must be put to death that's right hallelujah and you can't put it to death you're not drawing them that's right you need a higher power okay amen yes first of all we need to pray to teach the everything lord hold me back amen it must be it must perish but then the inside there's a spirit man a soul inside which has faith in god's word it'll bring our outside body under subjection to the word by faith or revelation by accepting what god's word said other than what the flesh wants amen yes nobody wants to do that hallelujah but then brother brown goes into a little thing and i really like it i and i kind of i didn't hear all of simon's message last night because i was kind of i was trying to study for this god changed my mind i had knew exactly where i was going a week or two ago exactly where i wanted to go or kind of where i wanted to go and i studied it all out and then yesterday or friday knew where i wanted to go and then saturday god changed my mind so i was still studying last night late i have a little thing on my phone it pops up and said jesse smith is live so i just looked on to see what oh simon's preaching i heard him preaching on the wheat that's right right really good job but brother brown said ask a question here he said and i i had this before i heard the message he said how can i take a couple bird and make a grain of wheat out of it right he said it's impossible for me to do it good for me to do it the only way it can be is because on the inside of the cuckoo bird there have been transmitted from a cockapoo to a wheat gene seed a cuckle bird to a germ called wheat life he said now you bury that cup of work it'll produce wheat why because the old the old nature the old culprit for nature the whole life has been taken out of it right aren't you glad for that this morning to have the old nature change amen the spirit of god [Applause] amen come along the holy ghost burned out the old nature the old huckleberry man hey man but he left that jean seed in the cuckleberry amen yeah yes he said it'll produce a seed if you're wheat if you're buried that's right because there's a life of wheat on inside of that hufflepuff he said and the life of the couple bird has been taken out the nature of the cocoa bird even though it's been taken out it's still sticky yes yes it will be until this new life has been fully developed out of the ground raised up when it comes forward it'll no longer be a coke over there amen hallelujah church we aren't raised up to this life yet today right brother jim i was the day i was baptized that racist hey man he's talking about a general resurrection when we're ready to go longer to deal with his whole body he'll give us a new body amen yes hallelujah amen but while we're here on this earth and out of the earth the old conqueror bars they're still nicky excuse me because it's got the nature even though it's got the nature of a wheat on the inside god sewed his own nature on the inside of me but this old outside man still needs to cry out oh god deliver me from this right now hallelujah hallelujah hold me back for those presumptuous i can't do it in myself hallelujah he said as long as you're in this life he said you're going to be stick you're going to have a sticky carnal nature i mean some of you young people maybe you've never struggled with some of these things when you get a little older i pray that you never do it but don't be surprised if that old nature raises up and tries to make you do something or treat your sister or your brother the way you shouldn't do it amen that's the old nature amen but no one thing there's a power that can keep you delivered from that amen the power of jesus christ the holy spirit man all we've got to do is amen glory but you know what if you do do that like david did amen he said that he'll he'll if you're a son of god he'll he'll correct you and he'll bring you under judgment and then david cried out in prayer and said lord god forgive me and he said the moment you knew that amen god comes and wash you while you're slowing hallelujah oh i'm so glad of that as long as you're in life you're going to be sticking have to stick your car it's going to bother you as long as you live but inside you there you're born again inside of you you're boring inside you you've got a jean seat of god on the inside but he said don't think that that stinky carnal nature won't bother you as long as you're here it will that that's right wherefore this morning i told you i'm not a long way to preach i'm trying to bring this down to a close wherefore this morning let him thinketh that he stand to take heed that's right bless default that's right each and every one of us in here amen i pray to god that we're all holy ghost filled believers this morning i believe i am amen yes this old guy still bothers me and the only way i get victory over this old guy is every day i pray like david did lord god hold me back i don't want to be found in the same mess i don't want to make a mistake again i don't want to i don't want to lose my temper i don't want to snap at my wife i don't want to do that i don't want to do these things amen all right somebody said well i feel so good when i just give them a piece of my mind amen i don't have enough to spare brother jesse amen and it might make the flesh feel good oh but what to do to the soul amen find your condemnation in me yes hallelujah wherefore let him think as he said lest he fall for there's no temptation taking you like we said there's such as a common command that's right but our god is faithful he will not suffer you to be tempted above that which we're able with the temptation he will make a way of escaping jesus i am [Music] you can do like david did amen when he found himself i can access that way to be delivered from temptation by crying out to god lord god hold me back how many want to say lord god hold me back amen fall into these things hallelujah brother give you really things we need to do that and we really think we need to do that every day i absolutely do think we do and so did jesus yes yes what do you mean so did jesus in luke the 11th chapter and some of the other gospels too but in luke the 11th chapter just happened to be the one i wrote down jesus knew i said we would need to be kept back from temptation and delivered from evil yes because when the disciples came to his deceptive lord god teach us to pray like john taught his disciples beautiful they were they were wanting to be taught how to pray i want you to notice what jesus told how he taught him to pray we read this and say oh that's the lord's prayer most our young people can probably recite it listen to what he's saying in this prayer and he said when you pray say our father amen you know you know when i was a kid it was my father that showed me how to control that horse it was my father that gave me the power a bit of that bit i mean it's our father who gives us a higher power this morning amen go to your father the one who's able to access the blood of god he said we pray say our father which is in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy kingdom come amen now in my church if at the moment i'd have said that they would all say well that's brother jim's favorite word and you know it's funny because i heard simon say something about this kingdom last night too hallelujah the kingdom is the holy ghost that's right i heard you say that last night i thought well glory amen i got that in my notes this morning amen amen you know he said he said let thy kingdom come thy will be done in this whole earth just like it is in heaven amen amen i want the power for the of the power of god to be done in my life just like it is in heaven i want this to be a heavenly body for god i can't do it he says i have to have the kingdom let your kingdom come that word if you ever looked it up i never looked up that word kingdom it's my favorite word i think it's pronounced basilia basilia i mean it's a greek word b-a-s-i-l-e-i-a basilia amen i like it it says royal power amen do you mean not to be confused with an actual kingdom but rather the right or the authority to rule over a kingdom i said that's what the holy ghost gives us the power to do that let the holy ghost [Applause] of the kingdom amen amen yes prayer lord teach us to pray amen and the first thing he told him you're going to need the kingdom power in your life to be overcome amen give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our sins and and forgive every one of us as we forgive everyone indebted to us and listen and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil god knew that they would need to be delivered from temptation yes god knew that they couldn't do it themselves he said therefore you need the kingdom of god to come down you need the holy ghost ever you need to pray lord god empower me by thy spirit to overcome this old nature amen headlong over the who's like a wild animal amen yes brother people went so far as to say that any man he made without the holy ghost is no more than a brewed peace they made this that's right that's right how many knows that to be the truth that's right church amen that's where we find ourselves him in that's why we need to cry like david hold me back we need to pray every day lord god hold me back hallelujah because you can't do it that's what i thought he could paul thought he could hazal thought he could amen i wonder how many other men and women who thought because because they were filled with god's spirit amen and they just looked away from that and looked to the flesh just a little too long and rather than looking to god he who's able to deliver found themselves in trouble because they trusted like david did i'm a king a man after god's own heart predestinated ordained filled with the holy ghost the rule of israel amen i could never fall that's presumptuous that's right right and he fell to some of the most loathsome sins that a man could fall to that's right because he wasn't able church i'm here to tell you there's not a person in that building that's able to hold yourself back amen you need a higher power hallelujah amen amen amen to hold back this whole wild beast with exceeding joy to the only wise god and savior to him be glory and majesty and dominion and power both now and forever i can't do it you can't do it that's right you might be sitting here this morning and you might have fallen you might have given in with temptation you might have snapped at your wife you might have said something you did you might have gossiped if you might have done something maybe that god delivered you to and you say how can i do that sit here with the holy ghost church if you've done it guess what you have an advocate with the father amen amen if you put too much trust in this old flesh and it's fallen i mean don't give up amen and you know what's worse than that some people won't they say well i would never give up brother jim but they go along with that thing in their life and they just let that thing fester and faster and faster they never make it right all right you know what david said in psalms he said when i kept silent my bones waxed as though by roaring me all day long he was miserable he didn't have the victory in man he roared all day long he said for day and night the hand was heavy upon me my moisture is turned into a drought as of summer see ya think about that how many have you ever been there oh i wish i hadn't hadn't said it well then make it right amen yes get it taken care of get it under the blood man amen because david said when i acknowledge my sin to thee and my iniquity have i not hid i said i will confess my transgression in the lord and thou forgave us the iniquity of my sin he says think about that stop and rest on the fact that my sins are under the blood that i can be held back from doing it again he said for this shall everyone that is godly pray unto thee in a time that thou mayest be boundaries how many will be godly this morning amen if you want to live a godly life he said here's what you need you need to pray him to him while he can be found you need to pray unto him that can hold you back in because you can't hold yourself back would you stand your feet with me hallelujah hallelujah there's one who's able to stop i can't do it you can't do it amen to him that is able to heal me the glory amen yes hallelujah when i saw myself going down this way i cried out to god hold me back lord yes he said so everyone that's going to leave god he's got to pray the same way yes hallelujah amen at the same time but with the same attitude quantity can still be balanced church is totally found in this man i wonder how many words be honest you know what brother jim i need to pray that prayer this morning lord lord god put this under the blood of jesus christ lord god don't ever let me get so so presumptuous to think that i can do it on my own because i can't do it to him who's able to keep you from falling there's the one that should get the they're the one that we should call you amen and lord if we have fallen this morning amen let me just stick your hands there pray for me brother jim that i can just be delivered from this whole wretched man that i am by calling in prayer to the one who's able to deliver me i can't do it on my own lord god let me find myself every day like david said hold me back from these sins lord hallelujah hold me back amen for what i have done lord god forgive me for what i've done and hold me lord god then i would never do those things again there's one who's able there is one that's able to deliver us from these presumptuous sins but we can't ever access him until we go to him and say lord god i give it to you i can do it i need your help but i'm not strong enough [Music] don't let me ever look away from the one who's able to look to this old man thinking that i can't because you do amen god you see hands around the building lord i had another hand i'd raise it to this world or god let this be my prayer this morning for god did i have i never amen presumed that i can get away with something or do something or hold myself back in my own flesh for god let me let me just run to you lord god and run away from that thing that would try to entice this old flesh let me mortify [Music] prayer
