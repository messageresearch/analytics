========================================

Jesus's name in The Dance Part six I believe it is Psalm 149 verse 1. Lord willing this evening we'll have like a short kids Bible study and then we'll record sister who is a final part of her testimony by God's grace look forward to that after that I think my wife is scheduled to go next you'd like to give her testimony by God's grace and then anybody else after that would like to line up Jose for certain and maybe sister Lina whoever feels LED brother bang you know whoever feels led to give a testimony praise God for the glory of God hallelujah it's all for Jesus's Glory praise God I tell you I'm so encouraged I was listening to sister who is testimony again this week and I was like wow it's just such a great reminder like how much the prince of God has moved in our lives and then that actually stirs up our faith to want to see more of it praise God so there is a power and a testimony so thank you sister for doing it praise God all of them all the ones so far have given it some of the Jose you might be soon buddy all right we got a good order now all right got some order Psalm 149 Praise of God again a beautiful portion of scripture of course this is worship you know under the old Covenant but we're under a New Covenant with better promises praise God if you could worship God like this under an old Covenant what about the New Covenant what about the blood of Jesus Christ so it's a beautiful portion of scripture here let's read verse 3. let's read that together Psalm 149 verse 3 1 2 3 let them praise His name in The Dance Let Them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and the harp now let's go to the next chapter it's repeated again in verse 4 Psalm 150 verse 4 this is one of our children's favorite songs praise God in the sanctuary here's the inspiration of course for this song uh let's sing I'm sorry let's sing let's read verse 4 together we may sing this today we'll see verse four ready one two three praise him with the timbrel and dance praise him with string instruments and organs amen may God add his Blessing to read his word you may be seated God bless you I do have a few uh quotes and scriptures I like to share with him and I just want to hand you this just hold on to this real quick I had a little prayer for today I just want to just want you to hold that by God's grace here so we'll thank the Lord for all his grace and mercy I'm just making sure if I didn't forget anything here so yeah Lord willing announcing on Wednesday we'll have brother Ben narad here on February uh the 5th he'll preach both services and I'll be at brother cams on February 5th he asked me to come out and he said choose a date I said okay let me look at the dates and I said it'll be depending upon when I can get a guest preacher you know so when I got brother Ben narad for February 5th I thought well that looks good I'll go to I'll go to brother Cam's and Minister there and then we have brother cam coming I think two weeks after that on February 19th he'll be with us by God's grace and also uh next week next Sunday night the teens will go up to Sheffield right for the youth meeting and then I'll I'll stay though I'll stay behind and I'll we'll have our regular Sunday night service here for the children in Sunday school and so forth by God's grace so just so you know we'll have a little bit smaller group next uh next Sunday night but again adults if you feel led to go up to the meetings you can go up there as well you know I don't want to I don't want to say you have to stay here with us you know just go by the leading of the Lord praise God wherever your expectation is God will meet you wherever you expect him to meet you praise God he promised wherever there's two or three he said I'm gathering right there in the midst praise God and so we're grateful for that God's promises can never fail praise God hallelujah I believe that's it for the announcements if I'm not mistaken here so we'll just preach here part six uh it was wonderful uh you know Wednesday we looked at part five and brother amen uh do you want to testify real quick just what happened there could you just tell the Saints what happened while we were worshiping there I also felt it one inside my heart my heart and I was I felt to come upon me the Lord come upon me and I was really nervous and very scared so I I didn't act on it the first time and then Pastor Jesse kept on praying and praying and I just kept on agreeing with everything he was saying and I and then they came again and that's when I felt the Holy Spirit fall apart amen amen friends the spirit of God is here Hallelujah there's another example you know how many times have we felt the wind of the Holy Spirit the spirit of God is here praise God and we just got to get into the channel of the Holy Spirit we just got to yield to the Holy Ghost and let the Holy Ghost have his way I was so blessed by that brother thank you for sharing that testimony let's give Brothers amen thank you sir I appreciate you sharing that buddy that's a confirmation of what the word of God that was preached and the songs that we sang you know that you that the Lord LED you to sing so we want to be more aware of God's spirit Among Us amen and I'm going to look at that here today with part six we'll look a little bit further at that but we just want to recognize that there is Supernatural going around moving at all times and we'll see if we're in the channel the Holy Spirit praise God how many want to be in that channel praise God hallelujah so it's just very encouraging to me you know to know that God is moving here and God wants to move uh you know I was looking there verse verse chapter or verse 4 in chapter 149 it says for the lord taketh pleasure in his people so right after the Bible says praise him with a dance the Bible said God takes pleasure in his people God loves when you worship him God loves when you sing his Praises God loves when you say a sincere prayer or you raise your hands or you cry or you seek God's face God loves to be worshiped God loves to have that communion with you praise God don't ever let the devil tell you no it's useless it's not useless praise God it's actually the desire of God's heart amen when you're seeking God and praising God it's the desire of both your heart and his heart praise God and then we know God will pour out his blessings to you as you Worship the Lord as you spend time in his presence he pours out blessings Hallelujah and so I just want to encourage everybody to praise His name because God takes pleasure in you this morning praise God so we did our verse here and I want to uh just go back if you would let's take your Bible let's go to back to second Samuel chapter six I've just kind of I want to go back here and reiterate a few things here remember Church David danced twice before the ark and on Wednesday night we saw what the ark represented the ark represented God's strength it represented God's glory it represented God's presence it represented God's name it represents the presence of God hallelujah and uh David was so elated he was so joyful brother man said he was just so happy that the presence of God was coming into the city of God hallelujah God's presence getting in God's City praise God and this would also be called the city of David so David said David was basically saying the prince of God is coming to my life amen hallelujah the prince of God is coming to my house hallelujah how many want him to come to your house praise God just don't come to our church we want God in the church but we want God in our house amen hallelujah and so David was rejoicing that God's presence was coming to his house in other words he was going to live in The Prince of God hallelujah church so often we just get comfortable living in the regular natural presence but we want to live in the Supernatural presence of Jesus Christ Hallelujah we want to live in the Supernatural aspect where we know God is moving and God is changing hearts and God's dealing with people and God is bringing about victories in people's lives amen God is changing situations God is going to get the glory god is going to accomplish his will on this Earth praise God and we want to be a part of it praise God we want to be a part of yielding to God and also letting God use us for his purposes and for his glory and so David finds himself in this position he's he's King now over all of Israel of course for seven years he was King over Hebron only you know Southern Judah but then you know seven years later the rest of the tribes get the anointing right remember the men of uh the men of Manasseh they were men of understanding and they knew what the timing of timing was the Bible said they had understanding of the times and seasons and they said this is the time to make David King over all of Israel praise God they recognize the time in other words we'll say like this this is the time to let God rule all your life praise God there's never going to be a better time than right now to let the spirit of God rule over your entire life praise God let me say like this it ain't going to get any easier to serve God it's going to get harder but so let's let's start right now by giving God everything we have let's give him every heir of our life Hallelujah let's let him rule over every part of our life Hallelujah and can keep it up and continue it and walk in the Supernatural of God hallelujah oh my oh it's beautiful David said I want to live in The Prince of God hallelujah verse one second Samuel 6 verse one again David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel 30 000. you talk about a Revival I'm not gonna we'd actually have a couple churches we're gonna have 30 000 people for this revival Hallelujah and David erosion went with all the people that were with him from bael of Judah to bring up from thence the Ark of God whose name is called by the name of the Lord of hosts that dwelt between the cherubims and they set the Ark of God upon a new cart that was the big mistake the Ark of God the prince of God was not to come on beasts the prince of God doesn't anoint beasts like that right it's to be carried by Levites it's to be carried by ministers amen is to be carried by God's servants Hallelujah not a beast not a filthy Beast or even an unclean or even a clean Beast it's not to be carried by a clean Beast it's be carried by God's servants who are devoted to his service that are faithful praise God they met the requirements amen you met the requirements because the blood of Jesus Christ brought you into the body of Christ Hallelujah in other words your call to carry the anointing amen you're called to carry the word of God upon the fleshly tables of your heart praise God Hallelujah that's the big mistake they put on a new car brother I said it's a denomination see or we'd say a Creed or we'll just say it like brother bam said any deviation from the word of God is one step away from the Holy Spirit so this new card could be uh just one sin you allow in your life one addiction or one complex right just one new car just one mistake everything else was great everything else was good in his life except this one thing this new car this new uh say like this this new uh this new sin this new fault uh this this new attraction whatever it was something new came in and it broke the the The Fellowship Of God it broke the communion it broke the obedience praise God but we've got to make sure all of our life is lined up with God's word we got to make sure everything in our life is obey obeying the holy scriptures praise God we can't let nothing new get into our lives that breaks our fellowship with Christ and they brought it out of the house of abinadab that was in gibea and uza and Ohio the sons of abinadab draved the new cart and they brought it out of the house of abinadab which was at gibia accompanying the Ark of God and Ohio went before the ark and David and all the house of Israel played before the Lord on all manner of instruments made of furwood even of harps and on sultries and timbros and on cornets and on symbols imagine the there's a percussion right there's the percussion you got the percussion you got the strings Hallelujah and David and the the people play with all their might verse six and they came to the Nay nachans threshing for uza put forth his hand to the Ark of God and took hold of it for the ox and shook it and the anger Lord was kindled against uza and God smote him there for his Heir and there he died before the ark again we're not to touch the Ark of God right they weren't to touch the Ark of God unless they were the high priest the high priest was the only one who could approach it praise God nobody else could approach it in this in this case it's being brought into Jerusalem it's covered with the badger skins but he reached out and touched it and he wasn't allowed to touch it this is this is what brother Randall said this is what happens when man puts his hand on the move of the spirit like you can't dance in the spirit you can't shout you can't speak in tongues you shouldn't you shouldn't run around the church Hallelujah listen death happens when man puts his hand on the move of the spirit but God wants to have his way praise God we got to let God have his way but when a man tries to touch the move of the spirit it brings death someone gets their feet and someone gets discouraged right someone gets depressed someone falls into sin it's because man put their hand on it but God got angry and said don't touch it you're not to touch it only certain men can touch your praise God there's only certain times you can touch it there's a certain there's a way in the prince of God we have no denominations praise God we don't add to the word of God we don't try to uh regulate when the Holy Spirit can move the Holy Spirit can fall right now during the preaching amen in fact that's what happened when the First Time Peter preached the Gentiles amen he couldn't even finish his servant the Bible said while Peters make these words the Holy Ghost fell on them that heard the word of God could he make it through the sermon amen the spirit of God interrupted because the people believed it they received it they they they had faith in the word of God that Peter was saying God grant us Faith to believe every promised word hallelujah amen God smote him for his Heir and there he died by the Ark of God now if you go down to verse 11 the Ark of Lord continue to the house of Obed Edom to get tight for three months and the Lord bless Obed Edom and Oz household so see wherever there's a sincere heart wherever there's someone who wants to obey the word of God God will bless that house Hallelujah but God will not bless beasts carrying the Ark of God will not bless men touching the move of the spirit who are not ordained to do that Hallelujah God cannot bless that but remember you had all the worship all the dance all the praise all the musicians praise God but three months later uh we know that David got the scripture right uh if you go to First Chronicles 13 one we might as well read it now first Chronicles 13 1. so here was David's main mistake and brother man brings us out of course and trying new God of service that's the first uh sermon I think I ever gave his sister a lady right there when we was in football and I was there at uh I was there at football camp and I was just reading my Bible I had really no friends on the team there's a hundred guys on the team and I had really no friends on the team so we'd have breakfast lunch and supper I'm there sitting by myself I'm just reading you know they're probably studying their well they're they're just listening to all their rap and everything like that I'm there at the table I'm eating I just got my Bible open and brother random sermons there well I looked ridiculous but to the world but to God God was well pleased and a lady and two other guys come up and said what are you reading we're we're Christians what are you reading I'm like oh I'm reading about God trying to do his service I think I was studying on tongues and interpretation and tongues not the evidence of the Holy Ghost and like oh really I said well yeah if you're interested let me know I'd like to share it with you and so sister lady's like yeah I miss her said so I gave her that tape God trying to or David trying to do God of service without it being his will and she loved it and then she started coming to church you know for all those years she come so that was the that was the tape that I think she first heard if I'm not mistaken it's a great a great uh great message there so here's the problem David's problem was he consulted the wrong people and David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds and with every leader so he consulted more with the people rather than the word of God he should have consulted the word and the word would have said don't put it on the cart don't put a man don't put it on beasts right we're not going to be able to work up our own human strength to bring this revival amen we've got to consult the word of God hallelujah we've got to see what the what does the word of God say praise God hallelujah so he consulted here's the mistake he consults the people more than he should he should have consolid the word instead praise God and George anytime that we consult the word first the people will follow brother when we preach we have nothing to worry about if we just preach the word if they're the elect of God they'll follow praise God hallelujah because we consult the word first Hallelujah I don't consult the people first of all what do you think I should preach well that might be nice if we were doing a Bible study but if I'm studying to preach and feed your soul I consult God I I spend time in God's presence and see what God puts on my heart and then I come out here and preach it and if you're God's people you'll love God's word amen we consult the word of God first Hallelujah so now we see why David failed he consulted man instead of the word of God now was he off by much no he wasn't off by much he was only off by a new car that was the only thing that he missed of course we know he wrote scripture right he was all about the scripture he was singing the scripture he was writing the scripture he was prophesying he was a mighty man you know he's a leader of the mighty man he was a giant slayer he was all these things praise God but here he missed this one aspect he consulted the people more than he consulted God may God help us to consult the word with every question in our lives because we really got to be careful not to get comfortable in our Christian Walks With God because the moment we get comfortable that's when the enemy will come around and lay a trap for us all right and we'll fail to really consult the word we'll fail to really pray about it right we will fail to really pray before we make some certain decisions but really prayer is the key for victory in those decisions prayer waiting on the Lord Consulting God's word first before we consult anybody else praise God all right so you got that now and now let's go back to uh second Samuel 6. now I'm going down in the middle of verse 12. so David went and brought up the Ark of God from the house of Odom Edom into the city of David with gladness now look now he's glad before he was afraid so look at verse 9 and David was afraid of the Lord that day and said how shall the Ark of the Lord come to me oh what a blessing what a what a principle this is church we're afraid when we don't have the word of God but when we got the word of God we're glad Hallelujah when we can look at the Bible and point at this Bible and say I'm doing what the Bible said that shall make us glad Hallelujah we're not just guessing well I think I'm going to try this with our Bible over here collecting dust but no brother bear said we need our Bibles open Hallelujah we need to be laying in front of our Bibles praying seeking the will of God that's how we'll consult the Lord and that's how we'll be glad when we make decisions that's exactly right so he brings it up with joy oh it's beautiful verse 13 and it was so that when they bear the Arkham Lord had gone six Paces he sacrificed oxen and fatlings and David danced before the Lord with all of his might and Dave was gerding with the linen ephod there he's priests right brother Jose after 32 years that's what God showed you Prophet priests and King amen and so Dave and all the house of Israel brought up the Ark of Lord was shouting and with the sound of a trumpet you tell me that they're gonna shout under uh animal blood and the law and 613 laws and we're not going to shout under the blood of Jesus Christ God's own son you're going to tell me they're going to shout under animals dying and all of us cringe when we think about our animals dying like who wouldn't cringe like oh you're gonna take my precious pet you're gonna take my animal they could shout under dying animals about the glory of God and then we can't shout we ought to be the loudest shouters amen hallelujah praise God because we've got a better sacrifice a once and for all sacrifice praise God we've got better promises amen hallelujah we've got more power Hallelujah we've got more ability and more discernment to discern the word of God hallelujah and to be able to consult the word of God we've got so much more to reference we have so much knowledge that we can harness for our for for our good and ultimately for God's glory God help us to shout and praise the Lord amen hallelujah I hope I do it all the days of my life amen and if it bothers people then you really uh you're really going to be surprised when you switch over to the other side because it's uh this is the quietest place you're ever going to be at like brother man said he said they're screaming and screaming and and and there's torment and hell but then when you get to heaven there's all the Angels shouting holy holy holy this is the quietest place you've ever gonna be so God help us to get this beer once in a while and really shout and see the Praises of God ah thank God Amen thank you Jesus not only did he shout verse 16 and the Ark of the Lord came to the city of David McCall Saul's daughter looked through a window and saw David leaping and dancing before the Lord and she despised him in her heart like we said on Wednesday see she was looking at the flesh instead of looking at the ark she's always looking at flesh always looking at natural things looking at natural things instead of spiritual things let's look at the spiritual things today what is God doing in the Unseen praise God what has God been doing uh we say maybe behind the scenes and yet God wants to move today let's look at what God is doing Hallelujah spiritually let's feel of God like we saw last week with sister Lina let's see if God is leading us to go pray for somebody wasn't that a great testimony sister Nina my wife said she was really glad you prayed for her Hallelujah or like when the wind of the spirit's blowing praise God let's let's go with it let's go with it let's Let It Blow Upon Us praise God hallelujah say church we got to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit praise God and I love that he danced both times because he was the first time he was just off one word the next time though he had everything right and he brought the word of God God with gladness and he rejoiced and then the Bible said he blessed the people and I love what he told his wife he said I was dancing in verse 21 it was before the Lord he said therefore will I play before the Lord when I see the friends of God coming into my city when I see the prince of God coming into my life I'm going to thank God I'm going to Rejoice I'm going to praise God because God's spirit is dwelling with me praise God Hallelujah and then he says yet I'll be more vile than thus in other words you've only you've only you know you only seen part of my strength right the Bible said he danced with all of his might so what what more could he have he must have had more praise God he must have got a second wind amen hallelujah he danced with all of his might but he said if you don't like that he said wait till you see what I do next praise God wait to see the worship I give God because I've been running from your dad all those years my I suffered for many years but now I see a Revival now I see spirit of God moving in my midst so I'm going to enjoy this praise God I didn't enjoy those 15 years of running from your dad I did enjoy hide it out Where's God where's my God does God even care does God even love me am I going to live or die now I'm in a time of Revival now I know I'm going to live now I know God's promises are sure so I'm going to make sure I glorify God hallelujah oh my God Church see we can praise God more once we've gone through the battles praise God they Jesus asked him who loves me more who's going to love me more the one that's forgiven the most not the Pharisees that thought they were all self-righteous and I never do nothing wrong Jesus said it's the woman that was forgiven the one who was just made awful mistakes but here she comes back notice notice how she comes she don't come back stiff and starchy she comes back crying and weeping on Jesus's feet and Jesus told him this is the one that's going to love me the most oh church we should love God for all that he's done for us for changing our lives Hallelujah from delivering us from sin helping us overcome we ought to be the ones that love God the most Hallelujah amen we ought to love God with all of our hearts Souls mind and strength Oh Glory I dance with all my might but I've got more I got a second wind Church that's what David was saying in other words you haven't seen nothing yet brother man liking it under this brother man was talking about this this scripture with David with him to say no if you don't like this he said wait till I do this brother man said you don't like the tapes I put out I'm going to put out more tapes that's how brother man uses scripture Hallelujah you don't like those sermons those those YouTube videos I'm putting out I'm gonna put out more like that or whatever God's leading you to do or you don't like that I got a lot more where that's coming from amen why because I've got a Living Waters behind me it's pushing me it's not me it's the waters behind me pushing me to do it praise God oh I know there's a fountain that's filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins amen the Fountain of God the life of God is flowing through me Jesus said if you've got the Holy Ghost he said you've got living water bubbling up inside of you oh my that's what we need some bubbling going on here today praise God amen some popcorn Hallelujah we don't need cucumbers we need popcorn Hallelujah we need fire Brands not icicles we need fire Brands Hallelujah people that have the fire of God burning in their hearts praise God not an icicle before God like I'm ashamed to raise my hands I'm ashamed to stand I'm ashamed to pray I'm ashamed to go down the altar I'm gonna say why are you so shame Jesus took all the shame away praise God that's why it's good news amen it's not bad news it's not shameful news it's good news praise God he died to take all your shame away he died to make you free praise God Hallelujah I'd be ashamed not to worship God hallelujah I'd be ashamed to come here and not give God praise I'd be ashamed to come here and be a stiff and starchy or any church I'd be ashamed to not give God glory for all that he's done for me Hallelujah oh thank you Jesus Hallelujah so there's David that's one that's the best artist conception I've ever seen of this can you can I even do that he's like this he's just dancing he's like dancing like he's just giving God praise all the sisters on the those are some real tambourines right there of course he's just the artist rendition of it so see that's the ark the ark would have been hidden behind the badger skins so David was worse from God the prince of God is here remember I preached on Wednesday Saul didn't want the Ark in this in the city he didn't want the prince of God constantly dwelling in his in his in his home or his habitation he didn't want to live in The Prince of God but we want to live in The Prince of God hallelujah we want to inquire we want to come to church ask questions and watch God answer our questions praise God that's David's that's David's quote from I think it's Psalm 25. he said one thing I've asked the Lord that I may dwell in the house of Lord all the days of my life that I might inquire in his holy Temple praise God see that's that's where you should go for your answers don't go to YouTube for answers Hallelujah don't go to magazines and horoscopes don't go to that come to God for answers amen come to God the Bible said come to God inquire in the house of God inquire the prince of God and Jesus will answer you praise God Hallelujah bring your questions to God because in the presence of God is fullness of joy praise God and the prince of God is strength and the prince of God is rest and the prince of God is the arm of the Lord amen and the arm of the Lord is his strength Hallelujah Hallelujah well I know I'm on the right path I got so many different vindications this is the right thing for me to preach amen I just got another one on Wednesday night Hallelujah like Brother Ray Brother Ray coming here he left he come back in I think everybody's going except Malachi he said the Holy Spirit told me go tell brother Jesse that he's preaching the right thing I said well hallelujah amen thank you Jesus that's what I want I just want to know I'm in the perfect will of God Hallelujah may God help us be like David praise God to be men and women after God's Own Heart now notice despite his failure right of not Consulting God in in the in the way the ark was be was carried he was still a man for God's Own Heart brother Adam said I don't have confidence in a man or woman who won't try because if they never try then they're they're neglecting their gift well everyone said I got more confidence somebody that will try to do something for God and yet make a mistake because we're all going to make mistakes we've never seen any pre think of any preacher you've ever listened to or any church you've ever gone to were they ever perfect no do they make mistakes yes did brother I make mistakes yes not with us saith the Lord but he made it regular human mistakes just like everybody else praise God so we ought to be encouraged let's not let's uh dwell on our fails let's dwell upon how can we get this right Hallelujah if I just disobeyed one thing God help me to get that one thing right and then watch the prince of God come back into my life amen Glory isn't that beautiful you're still a man or woman after God's Own Heart despite your mistakes and of course God was faithful God corrected him just like a faithful father corrects his son then three months later he was obedient to the word of God now just so you know this is of course the sermon brother Branham said there's five months and I think he got this from Larkin I was looking today I didn't have enough chance to really search it up but if you want to find the perfect will of God brother man said it must be his time and season now that's important especially for Divine Healing or if you're waiting on a soul to be saved sometimes you gotta wait a long time to see Soul saved right it's got to be God's time and season just because it doesn't happen in your time doesn't mean it's not God's will but you got to wait on God hallelujah wait for his time and season whatever you desire has to be in his word right the new cart wasn't in God's word it's got to be his person which these last three are kind of very similar uh so I don't really understand this fully but he said also the word must come through a prophet of course every word wrote in here is written by a prophet Hallelujah amen so any promise of God you're claiming it was written by a prophet praise God and then it must come by the Vindicated prophet okay of course that gets into the thought you know where uh Balaam was a prophet but not Vindicated as a true Prophet right and so you have these false the idea with the false prophets or you have the idea of the workers of iniquity who they've signed Miracles or wonders but they're not Vindicated real prophets like faithful prophets I mean true prophets that say true to God's word so just keep that in mind church when we desire to know the will of God we've got to be we've got to be serious about I mean that's a that's a big list like you young people who should you marry well that's a pretty big list there it's Gotta Be In God's Time and season it's got to be according to his word it's gonna be the right person right and they I guess they gotta line up with the prophet of God you know and it's got to be it's got to line up with God's Vindicated prophet It's gotta all line up with that right so no matter what the area of your life is that's that's quite a good list there to start with and you got to be humble you actually got to be humble to go through that and not just skip it David skipped one of those it wasn't according to the word the art the new cart he just skipped one of those churches we can't skip any of God's word right we can't skip any but we got to obey all the word of God but notice when he obeyed in all five he got his dance back he got his gladness back amen hallelujah he got his jewelry back he got his victory back praise God and church the same thing's true for you and I when we get on all obedience to the word of God we obey everything in that word watch the glory of God the joy of God the peace of God will come right back to you praise God Hallelujah now this this thought here's a the thought the Holy Spirit kind of gave me yesterday I believe while I was studying listen so this this this series brings the necessity of how we have to Worship in spirit and also in truth so we have to we have to meet two requirements right along with these along with these five you know these are for individual questions but as a church we got to have both the spirit and the truth right now let's read John 4 24 and you might jump ahead of me if you read below that but that's fine some of you always try to figure out where I'm going that's that's good that's good I like that John 4 24. it's a very important person that said we got to Worship in spirit and Truth a very important person Jesus Christ let's read uh 23. but the hour cometh and now is when true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth okay now let me just jump ahead we have to honestly assess ourselves right which side does Satan attack our church on the most right do we lack the truth or do we lack the moving of the spirit which one do you think you can go and say it out loud I'm not I'm not afraid ah yeah good brother I think I heard I heard one voice everybody's also peaceful respectful and fear in the Lord you know don't want to be wrong I know how that is I've said things wrong before I've said amen and the preacher was like uh that you weren't supposed to say Amen say Amen to that like yeah forgive me I'll go I'll go repent no church let's be honest we're in America right we're not in Ghana we're not in South Africa where they really dance or God know where they really get dancer we're just in a more civilized country right where there's not a lot of freedom so we're going to be battled a lot on the spirit right we got the truth boy I could preach the truth I could teach you this and teach you that that's that's good we have the truth but we also need the spirit as well and so we see ourselves lacking on one of the other we got to pray say God give us a better balance praise God help us to be balanced praise God now William and I were talking years ago I think our the family Williams family they have a lot of freedom there and to dance but they also have some just like us we have church splits here in America too because a preacher will get behind the pulpit and he's in the wrong Spirit he might blast people right yet you can have dancing and shouting and praising God and all those things right we so see there's examples where you can be unbalanced on one of either side but God wants us balanced God wants us to have the Holy Ghost and Truth praise God so I'm glad you felt the spirit of God on Wednesday I felt it too buddy but I didn't feel like that but I just felt empowered I just felt this is God I felt bold amen I kept praying you kept saying you're shouting amen I'm just thankful to know God's spirit can blow right through here praise God and may He keep blowing through here is my Prairie men let's not put up a Windbreak right I do not we don't want to put up a domination Windbreak let's cut down the denominational win rate flow Holy Spirit blow into the spirit blow through our church amen stir us up either you get us in a state where we're on fire amen blow upon the coals of our hearts amen and set our hearts aflame to obey the word of God hallelujah amen I've been honest before you I've told you I teach you I'm a teacher and so I've even this last year 2022 I said I've got to do a better job of preaching and teaching right I mean how many witness to that so that's me and my own life recognizing I see which side I'm more drawn to and I know preachers I know other preachers that they're more drawn to spiritual things oh it's got to be all Supernatural but they don't have good teaching and the church said we might have good teaching that's wonderful but we also got to have the move of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah but remember it's not all my responsibility it's all of our responsibility right brother Madison every person has just an equal Ministry like the pastor and brother bear said you got to be just as interested in your ministry as the pastor is in his ministry that's a good amen that's a hearty amen see I want to be I got to be dedicated to my Ministry I preach here for almost 17 years week in week out service after service I've given my life to this each one of us should find our ministry and give our lives to it praise God so think about that did you give an Hour of Prayer to this week's services or hour of study two hours okay I'll go up that's a better way to go right not down three hours did you give to this the the the the ministry this week did you devote three hours of prayer and study for our ministry to keep getting closer to God Hallelujah well brother Jess we're off balance okay well who's going to change that I can't do it all by myself we all got to change it every church is Satan's job to make us all fast every Satan's battling every Church to change the balance but real worshipers amen real worshipers God do you like Jesus said we got to Worship in the spirit and we've got to have truth hallelujah so that's that's our battle our Battle Is To Worship in the Holy Spirit and worship and Truth Glory now let me see did I uh now here's just just move down here on Wednesday I focus on this quote brother Adam said you know you're on fire when you're doing these three things you have a fervent desire to please God in other words you don't want to sin against God you're doing everything in your power not to sin against God in other words you're not going to remain in the complex you're not going to remain in a bad addiction you're not going to remain with evil feelings towards somebody Hallelujah see that's when you're on fire I want my life cleaned out by the word of God I want to obey God's word and then you have a passion to hear the preaching you have a passion to press play I listened about two hours of brother Ram yesterday his sermon was three almost four hours I didn't get a chance to finish the whole sermon there's a beautiful sermon the restoration the bride tree beautiful message beautiful ah I'm going to preach a whole sermon series on that just that sermon in particular but you got a passion in other words you're more excited to press play on the word than you are to press play on Instagram or whatever you know I don't know Facebook I used to be on Facebook you know you're more excited to go to the the Bible app than the Facebook app I'm not on Facebook anymore so yeah just because that's what they did to Trump there I thought Free Speech Trump's probably not even saved but you understand but see we gotta we got to make sure recognize hey if I'm not if I'm not if I don't have a passion to get in God's word something's wrong with me Hallelujah yes I've got to get my heart and life cleaned out Hallelujah I gotta get my fire back and the church said amen I gotta stir up the fire Hallelujah and then when we were praying on Wednesday that's what we were praying for remember I was praying let's reach out in the spirit let's ask God for miracles let's ask God to save souls and Hallelujah let's ask God to fill each one of us with the Holy Ghost praise God Glory see we got to have this balance we got to have reaching out in the spirit Desiring God Reach Out And Touch the Lord as he passes by you'll find he's not too busy to hear your hearts cry he's passing by this moment your need to supply Reach Out And Touch the Lord as he passes by Pass Me Not O Gentle Savior hear my humble cry while on others Thou Art calling do not pass me by Hallelujah see this is this is what we need in our lives we gotta we constantly have to stay balanced I find it myself you find in your life we all should be able to say Amen to that praise God there's an order for being on fire these three areas of our life and Satan's always going to battle us with this and so see we've got to reach out to to the spirit in prayer and see which side is he attacking us on what is he trying to get us uh to relax on is it having the spirit in our church or having the truth in our church he's often good he's often attacking us with the spiritual things how many kids Amen to that yes and so you see this idea of spirit and Truth Eli and Israel they had the ark and they thought just because we have the ark we're going to go up and defeat the Philistines remember what happened the Philistines whipped them even though they had the friends of God well they have the spirit but they weren't living in the truth they're letting those two priests steal the meat for God uh blaspheming God's sacrifices they were sleeping with other men's wives they weren't living the truth the ark was there the the spirit of God was there the presence of God was in the camp but they were not living the truth God help us to live the truth amen now see we could read through all these this could be a whole another sermon you know this let's focus on that David David had the uh David had the spirit but he didn't have truth praise God and even the Galatians Paul saw them starting going towards legalism and then he said uh I he said I I fear that maybe you're not born again he said do I have to come and travail again to see if you're born of the spirit let's go to Galatians 3 verse one let's read death I kind of feel led to read that Galatians 3 verse 1. now while you're turning there think about uh Vindicated Miracles that you've seen where something supernatural has instantly happened I'm talking an instant miracle instant not Divine Healing but it takes of course over time but an instant healing that's what we need in the church because there's nine gifts that's one of them Miracles are instant right now God's spirit moves God's hand reaches down Miracle time amen Miracle meeting Hallelujah amen I was trying to think about my life you know the woman with the uh kidney stone that was instant instant uh some of those other prayer requests I prayed for brother Clement's wife down there in Columbus instant like she was it's on tape she's jumping and shouting and screaming when I pray for her she got healed of like four things at one time her knee her back I mean all the nerves all these things at one time instant Galatians 3 verse 1. Oh foolish Galatians who hath Bewitched you that you should not obey the truth so what are they lacking here what's what's Satan battling them on truth they wouldn't obey the truth that you uh that I'm sorry before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you this only would I learn of you received you the spirit ye the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith how did you get Born Again by The Law of the law of the law or just hearing and believing the church said see they were starting to bring legalistic well I've got to do this and I've got to do that and Paul said that's not how God's spirit moves God's spirit moves you here you act you obey and God blesses amen hallelujah praise God see what he's saying is all the Old Testament had to go through remember the Waters of Separation they had to go through seven days to get clean but church you can be clean like that thank God thank God Revenge I don't have to wait till next Sunday to be clean right if I'm unclean today you know you somebody would sprinkle me with water it I'd wait seven days when am I finally clean I'm finally clean praise God but we got better promises hallelujah amen think about that church you can walk in here unclean and walk out spotless Hallelujah spotless Before the Throne of God with no condemnation because you're in Christ Hallelujah amen how did you get the Holy Ghost was it by all your laws or was it by hearing and believing it was hearing and believing so simple right verse three are you so foolish having begun the spirit are you now made perfect by the flesh see that gotten away from the spirit and the truth here verse 4 have you suffered so many things in vain if it be yet in vain look at verse 5. he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you do doeth yet by The Works of the law or by the hearing of faith see how Faith works with faith faith is the substance you need to work a miracle faith is a revelation the will of God right faith means trust also so we have faith we have trust in God okay so when someone Works a miracle God has shown them something God has shown them what's going to happen so they trust God and they go work a miracle so one time I prayed for this woman brother there in Guyana and she had a baby she's holding a baby you should have a kidney stone so I prayed for her we were both weeping and crying she went back and she said wash you I saw her while she was there singing she was praising God she started crying and worshiping God she said the Holy Ghost went to wherever her kidney stone was and I'm not sure where the kidneys are need to go back to anatomy class and she said she found a hot anointing there and then it shot down out of her leg and she had no more kidney stone right my mom's had a kidney stone a couple years ago she said it was the most awful pains in her life right so that was a bona fide Miracle it wasn't like well it's going to take a couple weeks to heal it was instant praise God and so these Galatians had people among them that were walking in the spirit and truth and they would do Miracles and they do Miracles by feeling led to the Holy Spirit to do something there it is amen yes sir um all right let's thank the Lord for that brother I was praying I gave that envelope to him I was praying for Supernatural today and I said let us have dreams and visions and all these things hallelujah praise God let's read that brother let's go to Acts chapter two we're done with Galatians 3 there Hallelujah Acts chapter 2. verse 15 Acts 2 15. so brother Chrisman the Holy Ghost fell this is what he promised to he promised to send dreams Visions in other words all the gifts of the Holy Spirit Acts 2 15. for these are not drunken as ye supposed thing is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel and it shall come to pass in the last day saith God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh let's see all nations and your sons I'm so glad I got sons and daughters I got Sons I got two sons not one son your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and all my handmaids I will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy amen so these are some of the effects of the Holy Ghost God's going to pour out dreams God's going to pour out visions and the church said God is going to pour out all these gifts upon the people so you just gotta we just got to be in a position where he can pour it out on us praise God we've got to make sure we're ready for him to pour it out because the Bible said they could not do many wonderful works because of their unbelief so we got to be in a place of believing I believe it's for me the Holy Ghost is for me dreams are for me Visions are for me Miracles are for me The Supernaturals for me Hallelujah it's for me of a son of God I I'm a son of the Living God hallelujah I'm one of God's children Hallelujah I'm the smallest people on the beach but I'm a pebble Hallelujah I'm one of them praise God I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them praise God so he said he's going to pour out dreams on me visions that's what God Said I didn't say that that's what God Said it's all I have to do is be in a position to prophesy like I pray for sister zern in 2021 I said may this year be the year she comes back and she came back in that year God bless you sir I sure appreciate you you're really answered our prayers amen Hallelujah the Holy Spirit shall prophesy Hallelujah oh it's so true but see we've got to be constantly reaching out to the spirit right we're in America we're going to be the ones where we need more spirit you know Church we're one of the few Nations on this Earth that has the mess all the messages uh translated for us I was talking to people overseas and they're like huh I didn't know brother Ram said that I didn't even know he's had that sermon and here we are we got all these tapes and church are we using them like we should let's do better with that they don't some of them don't even have the church age book which that would be a huge shame if they didn't have that so they were missing key sermons they need to understand the word of God so there's still some of their areas where they don't have all the truth they still got denominational teachings because they don't have translations Jose knows that right they would brother what when you got it when you got a message book what did you do with it when you first come in the message what how did you have to share with everybody and make copies and everything yeah they do they would travel they would travel around just to get one book church and we got an app we can have it in one minute and do we spend time in it like we ought to no we don't so we got to do better on that praise God we have so much truth but what we need over here is the spirit praise God hallelujah that's what we need we got to Worship in spirit and in truth praise God Hallelujah and this is like we said on Wednesday if you didn't hear Wednesday's service go listen to it it's a wonderful message and wonderful worship and everything but brother random said the cycle of death or Revival is undeniable it's something we're all going to experience we're going to wake up and if we're not in Revival we're gonna say well I have to get into Revival today I don't feel revived so I've got to go through this cycle again same thing over and over again you know they had that idea about Groundhog Day where the same thing happens over and over again when I was out in the world well that's kind of how the Christian Life is the same thing again and again I got to go through this again I've got to come up my soul don't you get shy on me I love that song Amen you got to stir yourself up again oh God stir me up help me to get in the spirit let me not be in the flesh let me be in the spirit praise God it's a constant cycle which I have to put myself in a position where God can use me so what are the main requirements go back to Acts chapter 2 since we're the Acts chapter 2 verse ones I just want great brother Chris to see this too and it's a great reminder for all of us you know brother cam has this uh scripture part of the scripture uh I think right when they walk in the sanctuary on the back door or on the back wall rather which of course is the back door of the sanctuary Acts 2 verse 1. and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord and in one place and then suddenly there came this wind suddenly it suddenly came to us on Wednesday night amen Hallelujah suddenly see it takes Unity we got to be in one place hey we got that bar taken care of now we got to get in one Accord Hallelujah one mind one desire praise God and their desire was Lord send the promise of the father send the promise to the father God bless you send the promise of the father Jesus Promised it he told us to go wait for the Holy Ghost he told us to go wait in Jerusalem here we are waiting we're just waiting for the promise amen Hallelujah so it took Unity it took humility brother random said and then it took prayer for the spirit to fall so we're talking about spirit and truth right if we need more of the spirit what do we got to do what the Bible says we've got to Humble ourselves be unified and then pray one man can't do it all don't expect me to do all you're praying for you I'm trying to do more prayer for me and you but I can't do all the praying for you eat each there's 120 people and everybody did their part amen oh we don't even have half of that so we can do it by God's grace all things are possible to them that believe amen Hallelujah we just each have to do our part brother sister we just got to believe God's promises we've got to pray for the spirit praise God we've got to Humble ourselves and not care of anybody's Watching All We Care is that God is watching amen Hallelujah remember these quotes but whatever said you know God looked down from heaven he said David you're a man after my own heart he's dancing around he's praising God can I get that picture in your mind he's praising God he's he's glorifying God he's dancing and praising God said man after my own heart he's not after the heart of macaw right in that moment he's down for the heart of the Philistine she's not after the heart of of popularity or or worldliness or anything like that he's after the heart of God he's like thank you God that I can live in your presence amen thank you God that the praise of God the glory of God is coming to my city amen oh send the Holy Ghost to Akron Hallelujah let it fall afresh in Akron praise God let the Holy Ghost drop down here let it pour out here so Jesus Christ can be glorified how you doing David well I done lost all my pride that's all we need we need to get something for stop thinking about well do I look right am I dress right uh do I look handsome do I look pretty it don't matter what you look like God's looking at your heart praise God Glory it don't matter what you sound like you might spit you might cry you might dance you might shout you might roll on the floor it doesn't matter because God Is Watching and God knows you're a child after his own heart praise God Hallelujah brother man said David was well acquainted with the possessor of Heaven Earth how many acquainted with the possessor of Heaven on Earth I know the master of the Wind I know the maker of the rain Hallelujah and calm the storms in my life and helped the sun shine again because I know him I remember them Hallelujah Hallelujah he knew the possessor he's the one that knew that the Ark of God would come back in and David just got caught up in God's God's plan David just got a revelation oh this is what God's doing right now and I'm just a part of it praise God I'm just playing my part I'm just I'm just here I'm God's vessel to show what God is doing what God wants to do and I'm a child after the heart of God I know what daddy likes amen hallelujah I know what my dad likes he likes worship he likes praise he likes to be glorified amen Glory oh starting to feel like preaching now Amen brother and her brother I'm saying I'm sorry to feel religious now [Laughter] Glory thank you Jesus remember I said you know what you Catholic people the Blessed Virgin Mary was with them now if God wouldn't let Mary come to heaven without receiving the Holy Ghost how are you going to get there anything short of it I don't want to go to heaven how many went to Holy Ghost well we ain't going to get there unless we lose all of our pride because brother Graham said and she had to wait up there until she lost all of her dignity well I'm so special now I'm not saying she about this but I'm Mother Mary I'm highly favored all the generations are going to call me blessed she had to forget all about that and say Lord Jesus pour out your blessing on me fill my soul with the Holy Ghost I don't care what anybody thinks all I care is that the spirit of your son seals my soul oh she started praising God she started dancing around like that and brother I said how are the Catholics going to get there when they won't even dance and praise God how are we going to get there if we don't dance and praise God hallelujah oh I'm so glad Hallelujah thank God Amen says did you notice the pattern here David had to lose all his pride Mary had to lose house Pride Dave was a man for God's Own Heart let me say this Mary was a daughter after God's own house of course she was she had the baptism of the Holy Ghost absolutely to see what it requires it requires each of us to forget about our dignity what dignity do we have like who are we trying to impress who are we trying to uh who he's trying to live up to their expectation I want to live up to God's expectation yes brother man said don't bring the Holy Ghost down to your level he said bring the Holy Ghost to God's level Hallelujah in other words Lord let me act like they did on the day of Pentecost I don't want nothing shorted up praise God you set the standard high but I know you'll help me get there because God lifts me up Hallelujah Glory he'll Lift Me Up amen he'll lift me up if I'm down he'll raise me up he'll strengthen me why because I'm an eagle praise God he'll let the wind get under my wings he'll lift me up with my old and new testament he'll raise me up in faith and I'll meet God's requirement he'll raise me up amen let's not bring the Holy Ghost down to our level well I might have got the holy ghost or I might have done this I might have that just be able to look at Acts chapter 2 and say have I acted like that do I have freedom like that did I have all my dignity going like that did I have all my pride going like that if so you're one of them praise God if not let's become one of them Hallelujah today's a good day to become one of them praise God it's a good day as any day the Bible says today if your heart and not your heart see that's what makes God so upset is a hearted heart you want to have your way you want to act how you want to act instead of saying God just help me to act whatever you want me to do I'll act whatever way you let me just let me be led by the Holy Spirit I don't care how I act just come on me praise God I don't care if I shout raise my hands I don't care if I blab around the church I don't care if I pass out I don't care if I dance around the church as long as you're feeling my soul as long as God lives in with as long as the Ark of God comes into this so that's all that matters amen that's all that matters fill my soul that the prince of God let the spirit of God come into this habitation may I be the Temple of the Holy Ghost praise God Glory thank you Jesus no you're not no you're not you are a temple no you're not no you're not you are a temple don't you know don't you know you are a temple you are a temple of the Holy Ghost why cause I'm full of Praise I'm going to power I'm full of glory amen Hallelujah that's what the Bible says hallelujah let's let's ask our Lord Raise Me Up To Your Standard of being born again not my standard bring me up to your standard praise God like I told you back at Cam's Church in 2011 I wrote it down I just was reading it that was the night sister Betsy prayed for three hours at the altar she prayed for you you remember that okay I didn't think so a long time ago but that's the night she got lost in the spirit and she she was worshiping God she bumped the whole Pew and the whole Pew was it was crooked it wasn't a straight that's why I like God God kind of messes up our order sometimes we got to get out of order just get saved Hallelujah and that was right after I preach I forget the name of it the message but she lay there at the author for three hours two of those hours I danced all around the church the the most holy ghost I've ever felt was in Cam's Church two hours so see sharks I can look at the day of Pentecost I can say oh yeah I can relate to that sure I danced around the church for two hours I shot and rejoice I clapped so hard my hands bled I can relate to that there's those people calling you they're drunk ever seen a drunk man dance for two hours yeah they do it on the Dance Floor every Sunday night or every Saturday night they do it at the dance right just go down to Akron I've been down there before we went up before I was a holy ghost-filled Saint oh yeah dance around the church for two hours praising God at the altar worshiping praying in the spirit for three hours how they remember they had to carry sister nailed me out when she got the Holy Ghost they had to pack her out of there amen hallelujah what church we ever look at the Bible and say I know what that's like praise God I'd be comfortable I'd be right at home with those those folks there amen I could say I'm one of them praise God I was declaring the wonderful works of God and I know what that's like praise God watch your life now see see the things you get excited about most and then you know what do you get excited about are you excited about sports games the most excited about uh going to get a steak the most restaurant eating I've seen some people shout for a steak you know you excited about video games the most see excited about uh maybe going on a date you know for the young people you excited is that is that what you set your affections on the Bible says set your affections on things above where Christ sits at the right hand of the father Hallelujah put all no those are exciting times don't get me wrong it's exciting when you get married exciting when you get courted you know get courting that's very exciting sure it's wonderful but that is not the greatest thing in life the greatest thing in life is the Ark of God coming into your city amen glory praise God Amen that God would share his fear and live amongst men and women that are carnal right we fall ashore we're constantly falling short but yet the blood of Christ cleanses us forgives us and makes us Children of the most high God that God is pleased to dwell amongst his children praise God that's the greatest blessing we can have amen that there would be uh gifts of the holy spirit signs wonders Miracles prophecies truth yes but also spirit but Chris what's your question brother Chris you got a question brother oh we don't know it's there's a lot of people say they found it but it really don't matter because the Bible don't the Bible doesn't say anything about it the only time the Bible mentions the New Testament is the Bible said John had a vision and he saw heaven open up and then he saw the Ark of God in heaven that's the last time now the the two prophets might have it the two prophets might have it there in the temple of Israel but remember on Wednesday night I don't know if we read that uh Jeremiah the Bible said Jeremiah said there's going to be a time when there's worship in Jerusalem and no one's even going to think about the ark why because Jesus is there he is the ark he is the prince of God he's the voice of God Amen Hallelujah so yeah that's why we don't care let the people find the ark let them find the uh the ark of Noah let them find the nails let them find the the cross of Jesus that don't matter that's not what Jesus is given out today Jesus is giving out the Holy Ghost today praise God it's like a rushy Mighty Wind amen Hallelujah it makes you bold it makes you love the truth it makes you humble praise God it makes you a unit to every promise of God hallelujah it makes you a real servant it makes you like Christ Hallelujah now that's what I told my brother my brother said hey I really like that I told my brother Paul said you know I told the church when I was preached I said Satan will whisper in your ear uh oh look at you you're not dancing you shouldn't dance look at your faults and mistakes but then if you dance it's going to say oh look remember what you did yesterday yeah yeah well God don't remember what I did yesterday so shut up Satan get behind me devil the Bible said he talks to the team forgetfulness it's God see right God knows how deep it is we don't know it must be pretty deep praise God cover all of our sins amen is that right it doesn't matter what I did yesterday it matters what I'm doing right now praise God I can't change the past all I can do is see God right now because he's the I am Hallelujah I'm living in the present because he is the I am God I am is here I am is with us amen I am forgives us Jesus Christ is the I am praise God he said before before Abraham was I am Sadie's gonna condemn me either way well each time I'll just point him back to the Bible the Bible that he knows better than me but he don't have the Revelation that I got you got it memorized but I got it revealed Hallelujah the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against my Revelation amen he's only got intellectual head knowledge but I've got Revelation it's a love letter buddy it's a love letter I read the page and I see Jesus Loves Me Jesus loves me he forgave me that's why I died for me it's a love letter oh he loves me praise God How He Loves Me Hallelujah Satan hates me but Jesus Loves Me amen as long as Jesus loves me I'm a happy man amen I can come to church I can praise God because there's a man in heaven that died for me praise God he lived for me and he died for me praise God the best part is church is that we can get so close to God where we don't even hear Satan condemning us anymore because all we hear is the voice of God I also hear is praise God thank you Jesus he loves me he died for me and Satan's voice gets so quiet because all I hear is the voice of God is that angel singing Hallelujah is that Holy Holy Holy singer I set my affections on things above not on this Earth as they always say Satan reminds you of your past remind him of his future right Satan you are going to be falling in a bottomless pit for a thousand years while we're on the earth with rods of iron in Robes of white We're Kings and Priests I get a thousand years with Jesus and you get a thousand years of Fallen Hallelujah I'll take Jesus every time amen and Jesus said you're the father of Lies so you're probably lying to me anyway praise God but I know Jesus told me the truth his spirit is truth the spirit points me to the word of God and the word of God says I'm forgiven of all my trespasses [Music] the word of God said blessed is the man whom now is Forgiven all the sins amen Hallelujah and if God forgave David of murder if God gave forgave David of adultery if God forgave David of a number in the people then God will forgive me of my sins amen because I'm a man after God's Own R2 praise God Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah members say and you're speaking to me but the blood of Jesus Christ speaks better things than Abel praise God it's better than your voice the voice of Jesus Christ speaks Mercy ah his mercies are new Every Morning Satan you're talking but shut up because God's telling me there's Mercy for me today praise God Hallelujah he's talking all this nonsense and we just point him what does the Bible say devil what's the Bible say you want to have a conversation say okay okay just let me go look at my Bible see Satan I have purified my soul when I obeyed the truth oh your Soul's condemned you're so no I obeyed the word of God I was baptized I repented my sins I'm fighting the good fight of faith amen I haven't laid down my sword yet okay Satan just do whatever you want my life no I'm still finding that devil right right oh no Satan see my soul is purified because I've obeyed the truth through the spirit and I love my brothers in the church I love my church family now who's going to say I don't know Hallelujah who's going to come up here and say oh you don't really love the church who's going to say that what's he Satan I don't listen to you saying I listen to the word of God Hallelujah I can listen to you see Satan I was born again neither the corruptible seed the life of God in Me is not dying Hallelujah the life of God in Me is just as strong as when I was born again amen Hallelujah my passion to know his word my fervent desire to please him by reaching out in the spirit is just as strong now as it was in 2003 when I got the Holy Ghost praise God oh Hallelujah so Satan let me remind you of that the word of God that I'm born again will never die but you're going to die my soul is pure Satan I'm born again and Satan the Bible says my soul cannot sin so you can condemn My Flesh all you want you can condemn my mind battles all you want but you cannot condemn my soul because my soul cannot sin and the Bible said Jesus was condemned in the flesh for our flesh to forgive our sins so Jesus died to forgive my fleshly sins amen and Jesus ever lives as an intercessor now because he can be touched by the feelings of my mind battles [Music] I don't have any infirmities of the flesh thank God I'm not sick but I have infirmities in my mind and Jesus ever lives to make intercession to forgive me of my mind battles praise God Jesus makes intercession to the father for me that's what the Bible says imagine that Jesus goes on my behalf Jesus goes on my behalf and Jesus said father I come again you know of course it's not two persons but father invisible spirit your servant Jesse Smith down there in Akron Ohio he needs forgiveness would you forgive him and give him Grace to overcome ah how many times does he do it praise God Amen put your name in there put your place in there the Lord Jesus says yes I heard your prayer let me make intercession for Jose's healing father remember brother Jose down in there in Akron Ohio he's got this he's struggling with this heart he's struggling with this this flu remember him father Grant him healing pretty soon oh he's all right praise God he ever lived in other words Jesus said just come to me I'll take all your requests before the father uh sounds like we need to pray more amen sounds like we have not because we ask not thank you Jesus I have a high priest the Bible said in the Old Testament they had to trust that the high priest will go in there and he'll contact God for me I keep giving you high five buddy Hallelujah I gotta get somebody else high five come on man Hallelujah in the Old Testament they were trusting high priest making her session for me please make intercession oh and church most of the time they come out right but we have a greater high priest than that the Bible said Jesus Christ is the high priest of our profession amen so we know there's got not going to be any human element there where Jesus is going to fail all you have to make sure is that we confess our sins and the high priest we're going yes sister who I'll go in for you I live to make intercession for you and I'm going in right now for you and he's saying holy holy holy it's the Lord God he's the Holy One amen all right Hallelujah Satan let me tell you you cannot condemn my soul because my soul is a part of God I've got thus saith the Lord to tell you that Satan and what are you going to do with that well you're not the seed you're not the seed we'll prove it I'll prove I am I repented I got baptized I got filled with the Holy Ghost I'm walking in the spirit I'm fighting against you I'm not fighting on your side I'm fighting against you Satan [Applause] amen you cannot condemn my soul and really that's the only real part of me anyway right that's the real me brother I said you've never seen the real me he said this is just a coat this is just outer outer outer shell you've never even seen the real Jesse Smith Hallelujah thank God condemn me all you want Satan but you can't condemn my soul all right because Satan whatever you say about condemnation it doesn't apply to me because God's word says I have no condemnation to me you cannot condemn me because God's Bible God's Prophet Paul said if I walk in the spirit which is obeying the truth a life of Holiness fervent desire to please him passion know his word if I'm walking the spirit I have no condemnation think about that church I don't even have a few sentences of condemnation against me in heaven think about that you have nothing that condemns you in heaven oh isn't that beautiful think about that you know you got Elvis Presley he's got all these years of condemnation uh you've got uh Stalin and Hitler I think you think of their long listeners but the Bible say you go over here brother amen as far as accusations there's no accusation it just says pardoned it's red and red whoa [Applause] there's nothing condemning you put your name there brother so-and-so sister so-and-so if I'm walking the spirit Satan there's no condemnation that's the saith the Lord and notice he can't say it's not true because it's Gonna Save the Lord and God cannot lie I can lie you can lie but the Lord can't lie [Applause] haha Satan the Holy Spirit has made me free from the love sin and death I'm free I have no condemnation I'm a free person praise God how are you going to condemn me I have no condemnation Hallelujah my soul cannot sin well right right all my other sins of My Flesh and spirit were cast in the sea of forgiveness Satan goes over there it's just a clear beautiful water come on he looks in there so I know Jesse said that yesterday I know he got upset I know he he spoke that word he should have said where is that and see he won't even wait into the waters because they're Waters of life and he's the spirit of death Hallelujah he's that pale horse rider he's death and Jesus is Larry praise God and if that's a c that's a water it's got to be the Holy Spirit so God tosses all my mistakes in the waters of life and Satan will go up there and say Oh Where can I uh I can't see anything I can't condemn him anymore let me go set a trap for him and the whole time I'm like Jesus keep me from the traps Jesus keep me from the traps and he's like I'm gonna okay Jesse I'm gonna make an intercession for you father keep Jesse from the next trap it's already set up I'm gonna win I'm going to overcome I'm going to go in the Rapture I'm going to heaven praise God hallelujah it's all set up for us to win praise God ah Satan says oh you're just a pretender you're guilty of lying you're guilty of deceiving you're guilty of lusting you're guilty of anger uh sorry Satan you can't lay any charge to me because God's elect cannot be charged with anything so he went to the courtroom the pre the uh the judge would say Okay read the charges against brother amen and Satan would have to look down he's scrambling for his papers I don't have any papers your honor there's there's no charges I wish there were charges I thought I had something on brother amen and then amen is standing over there next to his Advocate his lawyer he even said Thank you Lord Jesus for giving all my sins he took away all my charges Jesus dropped the charges praise God hallelujah thank God Amen Hallelujah who shall lay a charge to God's elect because God already Justified me amen Justified means to declare righteous who will Who will say I'm unrighteous if God said I'm righteous the devil can't say well no no God you're wrong God wrong the judge will say shut up it's my court sorry your honor sorry sorry sir he has to cower in the prince of God hallelujah yes he cannot speak against God he cannot speak against the word Jesus so perfectly takes all of our sins away there's no charges there's nothing against us so we go free in Jesus name who is that devil that condemns what matters is that Christ died and rose again who's at the right hand of God making their session for us church we sometimes we worry so much about that day there's really nothing to worry about because there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus yes we want to be humble all right we don't want to get into addictions of sins but if we daily confess if we do what the Bible says walk in the light as he's in the light then the blood of Jesus Christ will cleanse us from all unrighteousness I have nothing to fear in my future think about that you have nothing to fear about your future because you will not come into condemnation your future is clear all your debts have been paid there are no charges against you yeah there's little temporary ones but you confess those and God knows you're gonna do it already right so God he's already forgiven you in heaven looks like job how could job be perfect didn't have job is perfect in heaven but he was imperfect on Earth same thing for us we just have to deal with the we have to deal with the conviction down here overcome get the victory but haven't already recognized us we're perfect [Applause] God's the one that said Satan do you want to try my servant job the father had such confidence in his child so may God have confidence in us as well I shall not come into condemnation Jesus already took my punishment so brother Chris you can tell the devil this you said I heard Jesus word Jesus said if you hear on my word and Believe on him that sent me you have already everlasting life you have a portion of eternal life because you're saved that's right yes and you shall not come into condemnation because you're not trusting in what you've done you're trusting in your sacrifice you're trusting in the Savior thank God you know on Earth we want everybody to be a savior right oh Superman's a savior Batman's a savior this athlete he saved the team and say this there's really no saviors except Christ he's the only savior we need amen hallelujah we are not saved without him we are saved only through the blood of Jesus Christ he already took my condemnation Jesus cannot punish you because he already took punishment for you and the only reason they'll punish Sinners is because they fail to thank him for the punishment Jesus already took for them and they loved wickedness more than they loved holiness that's the only way right but it's already paid for they just have to confess their sins and say thank you for the sacrifice they just have to accept a gift all they got to do except a gift you know how hard it is it is so hard to turn down a gift you know somebody walks right up to you and gives you like a card or something comes right up to your door and gives you a gift so let me come right up to your door and like who's going to say well no I don't want that no no we all go oh thank you that's a phrase or thank God I appreciate that none of my children turned on any of the gifts I got them for Christmas this year and I wasn't hoping like oh yeah I hope they get in there I can get my money back I don't care about the money I care about giving them gifts I want them to be happy Hallelujah right but he's giving me the gift all you have to do is accept the gift and you accepted it brother Jesus was wounded for your transgressions Jesus was bruised for my iniquities I have nothing to fear he's already coming taking my punishment he already he already bore all my condemnation when I look at the cross I see that's what I should have been I should have been I should have been crucified I deserve to die but he died for me so that's why I tell Satan oh I'm not going to go to hell Jesus already went to hell for me how's he going to send me to Hell how's God going to send me to hell when I accepted that his son already paid for me paid for my sins and went to hell for me how is he going to send me to hell when I'm already living in Heavenly places how am I going to go to hell when I'm living in Christ amen how it doesn't make any sense all these years I've been living in Christ in Heavenly places and God's going to send me to hell it don't make any sense the fact that I can live in Heavenly places proves that he already went to hell for me praise God for Christ hath also once suffered for Sins Not for his for mine for yours the just for the unjust Jesus was made to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteous of God so God did it God did a trade God said I'm going to trade all of your sins for all of Jesus righteousness not some of it all of it praise God I'm trading all of your sins all your shame all your guilt all your fears about the future I'm trading all that for peace that passes all understanding just got to receive it oh I'm trying to get somewhere remember I read this last Sunday he hasn't forgiven some of your trespasses he's forgiven all your trespasses speak that to the devil oh no no Satan said oh what about last week what about yeah last year oh come on now the Bible says all right the Bible didn't say something the Bible said all of my sins Jesus has already blotted out praise God he erased it he done away with it praise God he washed it clean amen can't even see it anymore it's all washed out where'd he do that on the cross he did that the Bible said God nailed all of our sins to the cross and they were paid for right there Hallelujah so I have nothing to fear in my future you know church I was so encouraged I was watching a video of a Christian Broadcasting Network and they had a pastor from Hong Kong stand up and they were saying how um China was supposed to give Hong Kong 50 years of Independence but they they didn't even give them like they only gave him a few and now China has basically Taken full control over Hong Kong like Wendy used to tell us remember that actually that was happening while Wendy was coming and these these announcers are on there you know they're they're all nice dress and they're all TV announcers and they're saying well we just wonder you know as the Church of is the Church of Christ going to make it through this time in Hong Kong and they got a American preacher up there preaching to a bunch of Hong Kong people and they asked the Hong Kong preacher what about all these arrests what about all these persecutions and he looked right in the camera he said all these persecutions mean nothing he said we're not afraid of them if they arrest us if they kill us that's not going to stop the Church of God I thought my goodness of a denominational man knew the Church of God cannot be stopped no matter through persecution or anything what about us we ought to know God's Church keeps marching on Amen and they showed all these priests you know all these preachers in in Hong Kong being carted off to jail and this guy's like let him do it the church will keep marching on God's truth cannot be stopped God's plan cannot be altered just like Satan cannot see your sins God has done away with your sins God will make sure this bride gets raptured amen Hallelujah who his own self bear our sins brother Jesus died for your sins he already bore them he already wore them on himself he already paid the price for all your sins so you don't have to live with the guilt of your sins he already bore them that means he carried them on his shoulders on the tree Jesus had the weight he was hanging there between heaven and earth right he had the weight he's going up and down and he had the weight of all Emma's sins on him but not just Emma not just maokai brother Chris and not just brother Chris brother he had to wait and each time he took a breath it got heavier in heaven so finally said it is finished and he released the spirit he dismissed his Spirit I'm so glad he said it I'm so glad he said it's all I'm so glad he didn't say it's almost finished he said it's finished Hallelujah Satan's condemnation against you is finished Hallelujah it's finished the forgiveness is finished the victory spinners the Salvation is finished the Holy Ghost is finished amen it's a finished work Hallelujah I was a sheep going astray but I've returned to my shepherd all these years I was going astray trying to get into sports trying to get into different things all these things I was trying I was running away but pretty soon the Sheep finally came running back to Jesus oh Lord I love you I'm going to serve you I'm going to follow you Guide Me Guide Me and now I'm feeding on sheep food three times a week really seven days a week praise God we're sheep and the shepherd Is Watching Over Us amen running back to Jesus uh thank you Lord for giving me my sins that's all I am just a little helpless sheep but that's interesting he gives us the sword of the spirit so how does this how does a sheep get a sword I don't know oh thank you Jesus I don't know where to close it's been such a great service here let me see how much how much I got here okay I repeated that one okay I'm gonna go a little bit further I'm only really preaching once a day so bear with me I go to Romans 14. Church you have no condemnation because you're in Christ no condemnation there's going to be no judgment against you well Zur is guilty of this Jesse's guilty of this Vang is guilty of this there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus how do I know I'm in Christ Jesus because I kept his word he called me he invited me I'll say like this he's keeping me Hallelujah he's keeping me in this message amen he's keeping me in the faith praise God he's watching over his little sheep that the Sheep don't go straight that's what I that's what I want him to do I want to watch over me so I don't run astray Romans 14. we'll just read verse 17. for the kingdom of God is not in meat and drink but righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Ghost church we have to remember these three these three attributes of a Christian prove we're in the kingdom of God when you when you're Anointed with righteousness you're in the kingdom of God righteous means doing what's right integrity peace is being uh not with war with God right you're not at war with God you're not fighting against God you're fighting for God Hallelujah and then Joy is being glad and rejoicing now that's what we could use a little more in the United States praise God rejoicing enough to dance rejoicing enough to shout rejoicing enough to praise to raise your hands and praise the Lord amen that's what we could use as a little more by God's grace that is the kingdom of God remember seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things will be added unto you I found that to be thus saith the Lord Of My Life I got saved at 21 or 19 years old I heard the message at 21. so for these last 22 years and the message all I've seen is that if I put God first he gives me everything I need not everything I want everything I need he actually gives me some things that sometimes I make mistakes I buy things I want instead of things I need but the main thing is to give more of what you have like that with a woman she gave more of her what she had God's looking to give God's looking for us to give a greater portion of what we have it's not how much we give it's what portion what percentage of what we have are we giving what are we giving to God okay so there are so many Joy scriptures often look at this maybe Wednesday night but notice Church the kingdom of God is Not depression the kingdom of God is not fear did I read that right so you if you're in the kingdom of God you have no claim to say well it's okay for me to have anxiety it's okay for me to have stress it's okay for me to be Dreadful about the future it's okay for me to be gloomy it's okay for me to be discouraged you're living for the wrong Kingdom God's kingdom gives us righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Ghost praise God that's what God's kingdom produces God's kingdom is a Reign god reigns over your life if God is your king he rules over your life and he doesn't establish altars of uh depression and well I'm so depressed I'll go get my cigarette and then I'll just bow at the altar of cigarette smoking and depression that's what I used to do Under the kingdom of darkness or say up worrying all night he said worry all night who am I going to marry what's going to happen oh God how's it going to happen that's not the kingdom of God no that's not the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is I can sleep at night because I've got peace like a river Hallelujah I've got joy like a fountain hi there that's the kingdom of God hallelujah go to Luke 6 23. I just got a little bit of inkling here we should be pretty happy today by God's grace Luke 6 23. foreign so Jesus going through the Beatitudes rejoice I'm sorry let's read 22. blessed are ye when men shall hate you anyone ever hated you so much that they wanted like Hallelujah you keep that confession Jesus died so I don't have to be a slave to cigarettes that's why he died to break the chains of cigarettes addictions blessed are you when men shall hate you so you're more blessed if men hate you for Christ's sake and when they shall separate you from their company and shall reproach you see they don't want to be around you anymore because you love Christ he didn't say uh you're cursed he said you're blessed and cast out your name as evil for the son of man's sake so last couple years I've been I've been called a satanic preacher right last few years have been called a satanic preacher and that discouraged me at first but when I read this it actually encourages me Hallelujah because I know how I live I can tell Satan Satan try to say look they call you satanic preacher what do they know they don't watch How I Live they don't see my prayers they don't see my fasting they don't see my Bible reading they don't see my love for God they don't see me dance for Jesus and they ought to see that I'm more good to them than they are to me those people ought to see that I gave them way more gifts than they gave to me when they might have had a baby I gave them a gift when I had eight babies they didn't give me any gifts so what about that Satan who's more blessed I'm more blessed amen you're more blessed praise God because you know you're a child of God hallelujah will hate you that's a good sign you are a child of God Hallelujah verse 24-3 rejoice in that day and cower down in depression and hide in your under your bed the Bible said leave for joy in that day Hallelujah buddy one of these days you're going to leave money for God Amen right people hate us they come against us they want to move away from us they want to speak against us but Jesus said if you're obeying God that's a sign to leave for Joy praise God so shame on any devil that will tell me not to leave for Jesus because Jesus Christ gave me permission to leave for Joy praise God let them say what they want I got permission to do it praise God like David I got permission to do it Hallelujah that's what he told me to do and I'm more blessed to obey Christ than to accept Satan's lies praise God will not accept Satan lies I'll accept the truth of Jesus and why can't we leap if David left for Joy when he saw the word fulfilled why can't we we see a soul saved we ought to say praise God trying to tip my head on the ceiling you know cause all the ceiling tiles will fall down and everything like that I don't want to clean up between services but the Bible says if the word of God is being fulfilled if God's presence is coming into your life amen if God's presence is coming into the church we ought to shout and thank God say the presence of God is here oh Jesus dwell amongst us you're fulfilling your word amen oh thank you Jesus amen Glory you mean he can jump for Bulls being killed every six Paces he can jump over Bulls but we can't we can't jump over the precious blood of Jesus Christ [Music] that didn't take away some of my sins it took away all my sins it didn't forgive half of the charges against me it said there's no charges against me Hallelujah once a year they could get all the charges cleared on that day of atonement but Church our day of atonement's every day amen thank God Amen every day we're forgiven we're loved we're cherished there's no charges against us praise God go to John 4 14. church I got two scriptures that prove you're allowed to leap I know amen and whoa can definitely leap they've been they've gone through some persecution people have not liked them people have hated me call me a satanic preacher let them say whatever they want I don't care what they say I care What God Says and God backs up his word amen and God Don't Lie amen no and God never said he hated me God said he loves me amen how are they going to say God hates me when God said he loves me praise God it don't make any sense it shows they got the wrong spirit and then I know I got the right spirit because I can be kind to them and it's like pouring coals upon their heads I'm going to be kind to them it's going to burn them up they might be trying to smile on the inside some of them can't even say some of them won't even tell me God bless you and I'll be like God bless you God bless you and I'm like I'm like dying on the inside like this person hates me God bless you but really I'm pouring coals of fire oh that's going to burn them up hopefully it'll convict him to want to love Jesus Hallelujah to see that I hold nothing against him and God hold nothing's against me praise God God doesn't hold anything against me because all the charges have been dropped Jesus Paid all the charges against me John 4 14. Glory thank you Jesus yeah but whoso drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst I'm not thirsting after football games anymore no oh I can't wait to get to the game I'm not thirsting after cigarettes and chewing tobacco anymore I can't I can't wait to get those dirty magazines I'm not thirsting for that I'm thirsting after the things of God Jesus said I never thirst so Satan Travis is coming to make you Thursday well I don't thirst anymore Jesus said I'm not thirsty anymore you're just appealing to My Flesh and my mind but in my soul my soul can never there's my soul never did thirst amen but so is only thirster for the Living God Amen like David said I can't even finish that scripture without preaching on it he says but the water that I should give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life that springing up means leaping the water or can I say like this the testimonies will leap up inside of you for our sister for tonight they just leap up they just come right up right that's a leaping now look if if they could leap when they're persecuted and the man that gave a beautiful could leap over Divine Healing if we've got forgiveness in the soul why can't we leave over forgiveness praise God why can't we leap over eternal life amen you see it doesn't make any sense to me to uh to let all the worship remain somewhere else the worship should be here under God's high priest God's holy son God's son whoever lives to make intercession for us amen The Joy should be in the house of the Lord that man in Acts 3 he was leaping over Divine Healing what about us we have a greater Miracle than that man I was hoping to hear a few more amens on that your spiritual healing is greater than your natural healing because your body's going to get sick again if you live on your body's going to die they're going to embalm it or burn it or bury it or something well then where's the victory there there's no there's no continuing Victory but there is victory in a soul that can never sin again amen hallelujah or the soul that never send amen that's victory that's eternal life he gives you his eternal life and that soul that seed cannot sin there's no condemnation there's no charges there's no condemnation because I'm in Christ I just put up there I wonder church should we pray for these believers who don't dance and don't leap and don't shout maybe I should pray for them to get some persecution and then when they come up for prayer when they're being persecuted I can take this verse I can say well look instead of being discouraged it's time for you to leave here today well I don't feel like it well Jesus never said until you feel like it he said blessed are you you shall leap for joy huh right see church we see see sometimes we just look at the natural we got like these uh what do they call them blinders we got blinders on all we can see is here but around us there's angels all around us Glory Hallelujah the Holy Ghost is around us like a wind brother the Holy Ghost is blowing all over here praise God but all we can see is the natural but the Bible tells us we should have emotion we should leap when we're persecuted it's actually a sign of Victory praise God that were on the right path Hallelujah when your family hates you and wants to move away from you when people call you a satanic person or whatever they mock you whatever that just proof that God has blessed you praise God and Jesus said go ahead and leap for that one well I will then praise God hallelujah I actually have about five times here today I guess I will praise God Hallelujah when people say all manner of evil against you he said that's the time to leap for joy oh thank you Lord how many love the Lord today so what Jesus ordained leaping he didn't say you might want to LEAP he said blessed are you and he said in that day leap for joy he didn't say think about it he said leap for joy probably that well I thought we said I thought we said we're Bible Believers I thought we said we believe every word of God I thought I thought we're in the word all the way see I'm bringing all the channels to the church if we say we're in the word all the way we got to do what all the word says yeah if I get persecuted it's time for me to rejoice Hallelujah if the Bible says I have no condemnation it's time for me to act like I'm forgiven praise God Hallelujah remember even the we kind of went through that even Jesus compared his ministry uh John's Ministry was like morning morning morning repenting but Jesus compared his ministry to men piping and the children dancing so the New Testament spiritually makes us dance and praise the Lord but sometimes it'll make us physically dance like Jesus said leap for Joy this water is going to be leaping and if it's leaping inside of you how can you not leave on the outside hey come on George if you feel something leaping inside you how can you not leap physically praise God it's time to believe God's word because Jesus said if you believe on me it will spring up Glory you got to Pump It Up come on come on where's that where's that where's that Spirit where's that no the Bible said if you believe it will spring up praise God Hallelujah like I put up with brother brother amen I put him up there on their brother I should leap for Joy but amen has been forsaken by his family he ought to leap for Joy praise God maybe he has uh he probably has Hallelujah that's what the Bible says who's the greatest miracle how do you take a sinner like me and you and make a Christian out of us I can't understand it I can't either how God could take me in the position I was in how could he take me and make a Christian out of me that's the greatest miracle that God ever performed is when he took a a sinner and made a Christian out of us and if you can't now looky here I love this is a beautiful thought I'm going to close to this it's already 12 30. preaching two hours right that means it's a pretty good anointing if I'm reaching two out pretty good anointing in here this is a beautiful dog listen to this thought from other brand such a powerful thought you believe that God can save anybody from sin how many believe that God can save anybody as long as they're ordained a sin right I'm sorry ordained to life you've been taught that well that's a far more of a miracle that you can believe God can save your dad or your mom or whoever your co-worker that's a far more miracle that man was dead listen that man was dead and sins and trespass his soul is dead and he had to believe or remain dead and then after you're born again you become a Son of God how much more ought you to believe for a lesser miracle for Divine Healing if a man lived I'm sorry if if a live man ought to believe more than a dead man see what I mean you've got to believe it can't believe it believe it that's all you have to do is believe it you can't explain it but you know if God can save Souls if we've seen God's give Souls eternal life we've seen these Souls receive eternal life we've seen this Soul receive eternal life the promise of eternal life if we can believe that if we can believe the greatest Miracle how much more can we believe for Divine Healing how much more for prophecies how much more for words of wisdom and words of knowledge and discernment a spirit
