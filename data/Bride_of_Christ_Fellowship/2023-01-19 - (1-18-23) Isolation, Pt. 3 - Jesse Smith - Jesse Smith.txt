TRANSCRIPT
========================================
verse Luke 22 28. 22-28 I like to look at isolation again tonight also with this with thought of Temptations and trials you know as I said earlier and even last Wednesday you know we said God will give us inspiration before we come up to a Temptation right before we come into a trial give us inspiration to pray seek my face don't let up on your Devotion to God how many believe that Hallelujah Luke 22. 28. if we can let's read that on three whenever you're there by God's grace Hallelujah of course this is the Lord Jesus Christ speaking and what a beautiful expression here right before he's arrested and before he's crucified let's read this on three one two three ye are they which have continued with me in my Temptations amen my God has his Blessing to read his word you may be seated praise God Hallelujah so I want to take a few moments here and preach this thought this is a thought I really didn't get to last week I won the I thought maybe I get here but I will pick up right here by God's grace and I truly believe you know the holy spirit's been speaking to us here and you know we were prepared last week for these last few months rather probably for this season of Our Lives you know and we're trusting in God you know he's faithful like he's faithful in summer he's also faithful winter you know we go through trials he's faithful in the midst of these storms and we just got to have confidence we just got to praise him in the storm there's a song the kids like to sing at Arrowhead and it's a song like that I will Praise You In This Storm I think who sings that Casting Crowns I Praise You In This Storm there's another song they like to sing in the eye of the storm you remain in control you guide my soul in the midst of the storm it's just a beautiful song so we know God is faithful he's worthy of all praise Hallelujah so let's look at a few thoughts here I just want to review that you know that definition of isolation it means set apart from others quarantined um and I think this one here applies to every believer you know to select from among others to separate from another substance so as to obtain pure or you know I'm sorry to obtain pure or in a free state Church Jesus wants to make us pure praise God as we saw last week you know there was three simple illustrations of how God will isolate himself he'll pull back his presence in order to test us and each time it shows that we need him more with Hezekiah job and David each time God left them for a small season and each time it exposed what was in their heart right and so we saw that how God does that and what does he do it makes us you know see our our sinful side even more but that brings us to what it brought job to repentance and a hating of our flesh right the as far as the nature of our flesh the sinful nature inside of our our members the Bible says so each time you know God pulls himself back you know we're exposed to our own Humanity uh we're left to our our we'd say our we're left to our fleshly desires and the desires of our mind and and we we get a glimpse of what we are without Christ and we find it's not a pretty thing but I love how God is always merciful to come right back and invite us back in the presence of the Lord just like he did with Joe we come down here and then he said you he said you three friends need to pray for him he's my prophet and how God brought David back and he could go into the house of God and repent and sing songs and write a new song that we still sing today praise God restore the joy of my salvation praise God what a beautiful what a beautiful song that come out of such difficult trial such a difficult such an awful the very depths of sin and wickedness and yet a beauty can come out of Ashes amen hallelujah praise God just a beautiful picture God's story of redemption God's story of Grace Hallelujah these times of isolation they are necessary for all of us if they're necessary for job and Hezekiah and David they're certainly necessary for us that we can see our Humanity we can see what what really what we're made of in the in the in the mind and the flesh but then also cry out to God and say God make me more like you praise God created me a clean heart Hallelujah try me again transform my mind again Hallelujah make me more pure hallelujah amen hallelujah isolate me unto yourself praise God let me have isolation with you praise God Hallelujah the Bible says the Bible says he's knocking and said let uh let him that open that Hearth open the door and I'll come in and sup with him and he he will step with me what a joy it is to stop with Christ Hallelujah where did Joy to have Christ feed us the Living Word of God when we really need it praise God it's a real blessing and that's the isolation that we love praise God that's a isolation that we need that time alone with the Lord and then you know that first part we looked at how there's three types of isolation maybe more you know and then getting back to Hezekiah you know God left him for a season and and showed his pride you know showed his pride David showed his passions right uh uh and who's the other one David oh Joe Joe has showed his pride as well job thought he was more righteous than God and so with each one you know each time each believer is tested but the Bible calls that a fiery trial of our faith and that's more precious to us than gold or silver what a wonderful thing God does allow us to go through trials brother said that's the greatest thing that ever happened to you was the test the test of your faith is the greatest thing that ever happened to you because you'll come forth as gold Hallelujah and so God isolates or I'm sorry sometimes we isolate ourselves by our sins we isolate uh God isolates himself to a degree to test us or we're in constant or deep Fellowship isolated with God in that secret place right and then last week we looked at you know one of these uh and I added you know some personal names up here of course just to remind us here what I was saying here you know last week's message was two days before Lee passed away two days and then you know uh a couple days you know before brother amen got sick you know I was he was over at my house and he was just he's saying this is the year of Miracles this is the year of Miracles I believe God's gonna do great things and I believe that too how many believe that by God's grace but we find ourselves where do we find ourselves in the midst of a trial now let's have the right kind of faith in the midst of a trial praise God God's allowed it God's not surprised by these things no no God brought to us and he even prepared us with a message for praise God last week in the midst of this trial we got to call out to him praise God we've got to reach out to him in the midst of our trials because he's faithful praise God God is faithful Hallelujah so we're either approaching one we're in the midst of it the fiery trial of our faith or we're hedged from the trial or Temptation and some you know and some you know each one you can find where you are praise God if I believe as a church I believe we're probably right in here because the Bible commands us not just to to pray for others but to Bear one another's burdens to Bear them so think how can we bear our brothers burdens how can we bear our our sisters burdens praise God that's what we are called to do in this hour now I just want to spend most of my time I don't know how long I'm going to preach tonight it might be rather short and that that might all surprise us but we'll kind of see how it goes uh you know I'm just kind of stuck all day on this you know and not quite sure which way to go till the last few moments but um I just love how Jesus says this he he tells the disciples here in Luke Chapter 22. he says you continued with me in my Temptations I'm going to turn there briefly and read that again 22. now just this is such a beautiful picture here this is at the Last Supper the last time Jesus is with his disciples this is the same night he'd be betrayed in fact Judas had already left right but he takes this moment here after the Passover here he institutes the Lord's Supper he announces his betrayal Judas goes out and then he tells them in verse 25 26 and 27 you're not to Lord over one another but you're to be servants one to another he said the Gentiles exercise lordship over one another but it won't be so with real Christians Hallelujah then in verse 28 he says ye are they which have continued with me in my Temptation now look at church look at God orchestrated all the events of Jesus life and think Church Judas went through all those Judas went with through three and a half years with Jesus through his trials but the very last moment he left at the end may God help us to be faithful all the way to the end once Judas leaves that's the moment that Jesus Jesus could say you are the ones that have stayed with me in my Temptations yeah yeah I think it's important to notice that he points out who stayed with him praise God Amen amen thank God hallelujah amen and we want to be those who stay with Christ throughout all of our Temptations praise God I just noticed it's his last time eating with them while they're alive the last meal the last time they have a chance to Fellowship he says I just want to point out you're the ones that have stayed with me this whole time yeah yeah so I want to thank all of our faithful Saints thank you for staying with me all these years and I've stayed with you too amen I haven't left you you haven't left me praise God that's what I like to look at Value sometimes cry I said buddy you stay with me and look at my wife I don't leave out here you stay with me this whole time praise God yeah in the midst of my trials you were with me Lord You prayed for me Hallelujah you're a listening ear you cared Hallelujah aren't you glad Jesus cares about us amen if he cares about us then we definitely care for one another praise God it's just a beautiful portion of scripture here uh he points out some of the last few words now of course this is before he goes over right he crosses over in the Mount of owls and goes to pray before that he makes sure he tells him you're the ones who stayed with me hey George just just look at that Jesus had Temptations as well he was tempted and overcame so that we can be tempted and still overcome the Bible said he no doubt he had to taste death for every one of us aren't you glad he tasted death for you he died the most awful death so you never have to die that death but he also tested every trial and and every every difficulty we could ever have he tasted it right through the lust of the eyes lust of the Flesh and the pride of life he dealt with he he dealt with not just uh we'd say a Temptation he dealt with Satan himself think of that Satan himself like I told you before people that have said dumb devil the people that I've seen say dumb devil have had some awful things happen to them You Don't See Jesus doing that no no Jesus would say it's written Hallelujah I've seen somebody get cancer that said that I'm not connecting all the dots but I'm just saying they got cancer I saw someone there their spouse left him that said that because I I just think it's strange that that would happen like that because you don't want to mock Satan you want to speak the word to Satan praise God but Jesus endured all these Temptations so you and I can overcome all the Temptations he knows what it's like to be tempted with the lust of the flesh he knows what the flesh he knows the feeling of the the flesh craving things it shouldn't have he knows what it's like to overcome the lust of the eyes you know wanting wanting things that he sees but he's got to say no I'm not going to go after that I'm going to go after God's word he knows about the pride of life wanting to make things happen wanting to we want to feel like we're in control but Jesus overcame that Temptation and said God's in control I only do what the father wants me to do Hallelujah and he said you are the ones that come through all my Temptations you're the ones that made it through praise God oh may God help us to make it through the filter praise God the filter the fire the fiery trials amen may God help us to make it through Judas could not make it through money pulled him away let's not let money or lessen the fly uh flesh lust of the eyes of pride of life let us uh lay aside every weight that so easily besend us and let us run the race with perseverance praise God Hallelujah you know John Gill brought got this thought and I just was meditating on it uh he's a preacher from the 1800s well the man said the greatest works of preaching and writing came from that age he said ye are they which have continued with me from the beginning of his ministry to that very time they Abode by him they never departed from him when others withdrew and walk with him no more think about that remember all the multitudes found brother man went through the three stages of Jesus ministry right the healing stage of three poles right right which that just means three phases one of these days I'm going to preach on the three third pole or the three poles and just give you some Bible words for that because you don't you don't see third poll in the Bible it's just a third phase right yeah or a third Ministry a furtherance of the ministry yeah yeah but Jesus was popular at first healing everybody right that's the first pope Hallelujah uh the second Paul uh he started Discerning the thoughts and Tents of their heart right and the last one he started laying down the truth praise God the word of God hallelujah right and so he goes to these three poles and and with each poll less and less people came and brother Ram preaches that he says look at Paul the same thing with Paul big crowds and each time each stage of Paul's Ministry less and less people sure and then he says in my Temptations and I like this thought Gil picked up he said not in the wilderness by Satan see the disciples weren't out there with Satan that was just God that was just God helping the Lord Jesus overcome praise God for they were not within them not being as yet called to be his disciples and followers but in his afflictions by the reproaches the cavils probably not saying that right and ensnaring questions of the scribes and the Pharisees and their attempts upon him to take away his life by stoning Etc which were trials and temptations to him so when Jesus was out in the wilderness that was just him relying on God but then through the three and a half years or the rest of the time of the Ministry Jesus was not alone during that time Jesus had disciples with him Jesus had Fellowship Jesus had his disciples that were there he could talk to he could feel their hugs he could feel their handshakes praise God and Jesus was going to recognize that at the end of his ministry now really really did he have to have them no he didn't have to have him right but it was an example it was an example for us to know that that God doesn't call us to walk alone God gives us a church family praise God God gives us the body of Christ because where would the eye be without the hearing right where would the leg be without the arm we need one another praise God we've got to have each other's support we've got to have each other's prayers Hallelujah we got to have one another praise God and so Jesus gives us this example he had to have those 11 other friends right you know he had to have Judas too but Judas left he had to have those 11 other faithful ones right next to him Hallelujah now here uh Gill gives three uh three kind of descriptions there and let's get your Bible here I'd like to read some of these here I want you to uh just take a maybe a fresh look at this and see you know the actual Temptations where the disciples were right there but yet they stayed by Jesus the whole time Matthew 9 I'll just we'll just go Matthew right in the order Matthew Mark Luke and John here so if you've got your Bible Matthew 9 1-8 and he entered into a ship and passed over and came into his own City and behold they brought to him a man sick of the palsy lying on a bed and Jesus seeing their faith I like that Christ sees our faith he sees all of our efforts to get to him praise God and said unto the sick of the palsy son be a good cheer thy sins be forgiven thee and behold certain of the scribes say within themselves this man blasphemeth and Jesus knoweth their thoughts said wherefore think ye evil in your hearts for whether it's easier to say thy sins be forgiven the order to say arise and walk but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on Earth to forgive sins then saith he to the sick of the palsy arise take up thy bed and go into that house and he arose in the party to his house but the multitude saw they marveled and glorified God which had such power uh unto I'm sorry which gave such power unto men praise God now the Bible said Jesus knew their thoughts but no doubt the disciples would have noticed these Pharisees were upset with him and no doubt afterwards they would have said he blasphemed he said he can forgive sins and we know eventually they call him a blasphemer so think about that you're following Christ but everybody else you're in the minority everybody else in the majority is calling your Christ your leader a blasphemer but yet they stayed right with Jesus praise God and what was it was Satan twisting the twisting the thought right Satan just twists this oh he can oh see uh Jesus can't forgive sins he's just a man but they didn't realize he was more than a man Hallelujah right it seemed like they had a scriptural foundation for but they misunderstood Jesus was more than a man he was Emmanuel God With Us hallelujah amen and if he's Emmanuel then he can forgive sins amen but see they stayed there well everybody else calling the blasphemer while he was in the while they were in the minority and the majority spoke against him the majority said evil things the faithful one stood right there in the midst of his Temptations Hallelujah verse 9. and as Jesus passed forth from hence he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the receipt of custom and he said unto him follow me and he rose and followed him and it came to pass it Jesus sat at me in the house behold many Republicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples and when the Pharisees saw it they sent him his unto his disciples why eateth your master Republicans and sinners but when Jesus heard that he said unto them they that be whole need not a physician but they that are sick but go ye and learn what that meaneth I will have mercy and not sacrifice for I am come not to call the righteous but Sinners to repentance praise God so here all the people or all the religious people are saying your your leaders Unholy Your Leader is hanging out with the scum of the earth right right and Jesus says you don't understand what Mercy is Right Mercy goes out to the hurting Mercy goes out to those that are in trouble Mercy he said you haven't learned what Mercy is to see now here's another here's another trial everybody said Jesus is hanging around with sinners he's a blasphemer he's an Unholy man he's a lover of Sinners he's unclean he doesn't respect God's holiness and yet they stayed with him he the other religious people make themselves look more holy but they had a choice to make which side am I going to go you got a choice here tonight too praise God verse 14. then came to him the Disciples of John saying why do we and the Pharisees fast off but thy disciples fast not and Jesus said to them can the children of the Bride chamber more as long as the bridegroom is with them but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them then shall they fasten now he's accused of he's not as separated as other people right we all know churches that promote 40 days of fasting right and people could look down on us well why haven't you done that well the Bible doesn't necessarily call every person to do that right but see look at Satan just bringing accusation blasphemer Unholy not as devoted not as holy and sacred as other people but the the whole point had to be made who was the word of God who had the revelation of God it was Jesus amen Jesus had the ministry of the hour praise God and that's what we find here that we have the ministry of the hour of Hallelujah let's go to uh or Mark chapter 3. I believe in discipline I believe in these things I believe in dedication Hallelujah I believe in bringing your body into subjection of the word of God but see Satan can try to pervert that Satan can try to make it a pride thing see so each time you have to see what's the word who's got the word where's the true where's the true word of God where's the move of the Holy Spirit praise God remember Jesus said their wash on the outside but inward uh they're dead men's bones they look clean on the outside but inward they're dead men's bones why because they speak against the word of God Mark 3 21. and when his friends heard of it they went out to lay hold on him for they said he is beside himself and the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said he hath to be else above and by the prince of devils cast as he out devils so Jesus had just healed a withered man's hand and you have two more groups come to him now the disciples are standing there watching these groups come Jesus own friends his friends from Nazareth his hometown friends his high school friends maybe we'll say or whatever his hometown friends yeah they come up and say Jesus you've lost your mind something is wrong with you you're speaking against the Pharisees and you're doing healings and and it's questionable and then the Pharisees say he's an absolute devil now where would Juiced it right we would have stood with God's word we said we would have stood with the Holy Ghost praise God just like we're doing today praise God but these are trials these are Temptations people would call you a devil right like I shared a few weeks ago I get called devil from time to time oh yeah but again I know my life I know what the word says about me Hallelujah I know what the blood of Jesus Christ does Amen it washes away all my sins praise God and usually the person pointing the accuser that's the one who really needs to be accused right that's what we found but see they had to live live above all that well you're beside you guys lost your minds you guys are the fanatic crowd you're following all these all these false things and and you're the ones that are wrong and the devil's deceived you but you we have to stay with God's word hallelujah this is a beautiful one here Mark I'm sorry Luke 4 16. these are all good but I just want you to see what all these disciples had to endure Luke 4 16. now you remember Jesus goes into the synagogue he reads from Isaiah 61 he sits down in verse 20 and he closed the book and gave it again to the minister and sat down in the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fasted on him remember he preached about his Healing Ministry he read the scriptures about his Healing Ministry in verse 21 he began to say to them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears and all bear and witness and wondered at the gracious Words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this Joseph's son unbelief right so they failed to see the supernatural they looked only at the natural right and then he rebukes them in verse 23 he said to them ye will surely say unto me this proverb or physician heal thyself whatsoever We Have Heard done in Capernaum do also here in thy country and he said very last saying to you no Prophet is accepted his own country now look at that they were going to say do Miracles if you have all those testimonies out there why don't you have them here let's see Church what does it prove God only does Miracles when he wants to do Miracles praise God right he could not do many miracles because they're unbelief praise God I just love this it just shows how God moves when he wants to move he's got a Time see a season four he's got a time for it'll always be at the right time Hallelujah but Satan wants to say do it now do it come on do it now physician come on Big Shot yeah come on uh big come on big guy with the testimony yeah come on sister you have all these testimonies come on do it now where are you at now that's the devil right but it was a test well yeah yeah we you know the disciples what were they thinking yeah well we did see G's do that it's not happening here did he lose his ministry no no no their unbelief was hindering the ministry right it could have been that and also could have been maybe God didn't want to heal anybody there just like at the pool Bethesda how many did he heal there's multitudes laying there how many did he heal Church one person at the pool of Bethesda and he really and Jesus really kind of just healed him without him really asking for it God just did a great work in his life just to show him favor praise God but the disciples could have been saying there of course no doubt they were and they had to they had to go through they had to go through all these trials with Jesus now verse 25 but I tell you of a truth many widows were in the Israel in the days of Elias when the heat heaven was shut up three years and six months when the great family was throughout all the land but unto none of them was Eliza same unto serapta a city of sidon unto a woman that was a widow and many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet and none of them was cleansed saving Naaman the serum so look there's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever there's many leopards got lepers God heals one there's many starving widows God Saves one is he the same absolutely he's the same now when they heard that how they respond remember before they were gracious words but when Jesus rebukes them and tells them within their heart verse 28 and all day in the synagogue when they heard these things were filled with Wrath so imagine if his disciples are there they see everybody mad at Jesus right right right and they rose up and thrust him out of the city can you imagine them pushing Jesus out of the city we don't want you right just like with the pigs in the swine we don't want you get out of our city see they push away the word but we invite the word of God hallelujah we want the Holy Spirit here hallelujah we want the scripture to be fulfilled in our midst amen hallelujah thank God and they led him to the Bro the brow of the Hill whereupon their city was built that they might cast him down headlong but he passing through the midst of them went his way so it proves Satan can't do anything to you unless God allows it amen they push him all the way to the edge and somehow he just walks in right through them they're blinded to him just like the Prophet Elijah amen they get blinded to him see God won't allow anything unless it's his will to happen so if he allows it we ought to say thank God thank God for bringing me this test and help me to overcome this test praise God the disciples saw that they saw him being pushed they saw this violence against him they saw the anger that he stirred up but they stayed with him in Luke 6 1-11 the scriptures say that the Pharisees accused him of blaspheming the Sabbath well now you don't even keep the holy day right he says he forgives sins and now he heals and works he works on the Sabbath day I mean how much how many more accusations can he have he's a devil he's a blasphemer he says he can forgive He makes himself equal with God he said before Abraham was I am amen Hallelujah yet his disciples stood with him right there in Luke 8 I believe it's jairus's daughter Jesus comes in the house everybody's weeping and crying and Jesus Jesus says she's not dead she sleeps and everybody starts laughing at him right right but we know three of them three is three closest three disciples with the gifts rather the three disciples with the gifts that worked really well together they went in together and Jesus showed him this is how you raise the dead Hallelujah praise God but they had to stay with him despite all the laughing church have you been laughed at or if you've been made fun of just know Jesus will stand with you if you stand with him praise God whether your name called whether they people are trying to ruin your reputation they say you're too holy or not holy enough we stay with the word of God hallelujah Satan throws every attack every accusation right at us we've got to stand there in the midst of the Temptation and we've got to speak God's word we've got to hang with God's word we must continue with the word of God hallelujah man John 6 let's go there John 6 66 for mayor of scripture actually let's go up to verse 63 which is a beautiful portion here it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profit of nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life there's life in the word of God but there are some of you that believe not for Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray him so Jesus knew these seventy and Judas right they're at least 71. Jesus knew they would believe for a while like that seed fall on the ground on the Stony ground and believed for a while it rejoiced with joy they had joy in the house of the Lord for a little while but Jesus knew they didn't have the right foundation their Foundation was stoned what they needed was a real good honest Heart Foundation praise God and as the scripture says Jesus knew when he started preaching the words that I in the bread of the I'm the bread of life praise God I'm the bread that came down from heaven Hallelujah as he said in John chapter 6. he says uh verse let's read uh verse 65. and he said therefore said I unto you that no man can come unto me except that we're given unto him of the father and from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him he didn't lose a few it's like getting he lost almost all of them is that right Church like brother man said he's thinning out the crowd why to get down to the real cream of the crop Hallelujah I'm glad to be a part of the cream of the crop hallelujah thank God all these things about brother random they can run people up that's because they never believed in the first place right or maybe they believe for a little while but they didn't they never had the real ground of God in the first place that's what I want to say Amen the seed may have fallen on the heart but the heart was never the right kind of ground Hallelujah that's right you mean to tell me these people can be talked out of brother Brown's message and go back to the trinity and go back to the pope some of them say now the Catholic church is not the mother Harlan well who else killed millions of Protestants during the the Crusades who else was it how could they how could they be persuaded is because they didn't have a good and honest heart to begin with the churches I've been showing some of my YouTube videos lately they'll let a one minute and 40 second video convince them that brother Brandon plagiarized yeah brother random preached two hours two and a half hours on a seal and they'll and they'll they'll take three or four words of brother random and try to prove he was a plagiarist with three or four words out of a two and a half hour sermon if you can be deceived by that you you didn't have the right heart in the first place praise God and the people in the comments say that's amazing research they actually say that it's amazing research it's amazingly simple way that Satan deceives people that don't have an oddest heart praise God it's just like in the Bible when they uh it's just like in the Bible when the Pharisees said oh we never saw a prophet born out of Bethlehem or whatever one uh but they I'm sorry Nazareth yeah they said we never heard of a prophet born in Nazareth but he wasn't born in Nazareth he was born in Bethlehem they never searched it out to see where was he really born they were having false accusations against him but the Bible says the righteous study it to answer praise God that's what I was telling brother Simon I said some of these people that leave the message I wonder if they're even righteous how can you be righteous when you won't study a sermon and then the sermon proves brother and wasn't a plagiarist but yet you'll call Brother random Pleasures when you won't even study to have the right answer yourself that shows a very disrighteous heart or I don't even not surprised probably not even a word an unrighteous heart because a righteous heart studies to give the right answer yes is that right we want to know what we're talking about it's so thin it's thinner than the broth of a chicken the shadow of a chicken that's starved to death right they're one minute one and a half minute videos falsely accusing brother Bram it's a shame they never understood the seals to begin with Brother Ray for 30 40 20 years they said amen to the seals and they never understood the seals in the first place with shows they had intellectualism not revelation because when you got Revelation the Gates of Hell won't Prevail against you here we stand today on the revelation of God's word hallelujah we're standing on it praise God and God backs up his word hallelujah the righteous studies the answer so people that want to go they're going to go no matter what you show if they really want to go they're going to go see Jesus preached the word in John chapter 6 and many of the disciples went away they just walked away despite all the scriptures despite all these things despite all the Miracles they still walk away verse 67 then said Jesus unto the twelve will ye go away will you also go away so then he brings it down and tests them to their faces do you want to go to go too so it would not be unlike Jesus to come to our church or any message church and say do you want to leave the message too do you want to go out and have some fun and sin it's just fun for a season and then it's death and destruction and sorrow it's abuse is from the devil it's just it's the very depths of sin so it'd be like the Holy Spirit today to say the same thing do we want to go as well no sir let's be like Peter praise God Hallelujah verse 68 then Peter answered and said Lord to whom shall we go thou Hast the words of eternal life praise God Hallelujah thank God these people question about around his ministry I said and I told one of them I said brother I said there I have 30 thus saith the Lords from Brother Branham in that book I wrote will you go search it out and to this point he hasn't and when I offer these critics go read my book they won't even read it they'll look into all these lies and fake research but they won't even look into the word of God but thank God we've got the word of God hallelujah with thus saith the Lord where else we we go we've got words of eternal life praise God we've got words that just being baptized ain't enough you got to be filled with the Holy Ghost praise God hallelujah we've got thus saith the Lord God is not three persons having a relationship with himself God is one person Hallelujah we have all these we have thou saith the Lord God gives three works of Grace God's got to call you forgive you he's got to clean you out that he's got to fill you where other churches say he does all three at the same time we know it's a lie but we've got thus saith the Lord that's the bible message that we must receive amen amen Hallelujah we've got thus saith the Lord the Roman Catholic Church is the mother harlot Hallelujah where other people won't go there with a 10-foot pole that's okay we'll point right to it and say it's thus saith the Lord Hallelujah where else are we going to go last year or two years ago brother William and I visited 12 churches and let me be honest with you tell you I could not go in any of those churches it's my home Church because of all the immodesty the weak preaching the weak pulpits there's no Freedom there's no Liberty right there's no joy there's no Victory there's no revelation but we've got all that here praise God we've got all that here hallelujah where else could we go I have nowhere else to go except to God's people hallelujah thank you to the word of God hallelujah like brother man said and take it sides with Jesus he said there was anything better I take you there I take my little church and I go support it Hallelujah same thing here if there's anything greater we go support it but this is the word of God this is thus saith the Lord where else will we go we're staying with God's word hallelujah amen thank God and yet Jesus his disciple stood right there when Jesus said do you want to go to do you want to leave as well they had to stand there and they had to stand the test but Jesus would thank them later thank you for standing with me in my Temptations in other words Church Jesus is watching how you stand Jesus notices your stand for the truth sometimes where we let's we ended last week's message with the feeling of not being seen by God it's such a lie from Satan to say God doesn't see you God sees everything you do oh yes God sees every detail of our lives and God sees that we're standing on the truth God sees that we're continuing to hear the word of God we're continuing to seek his Fellowship we're continuing to press on toward the mark of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus amen Hallelujah because we're laboring for a better Resurrection we don't want to be at the second Resurrection as far as raised up there we want to be raised up at the first resurrection yeah The church here we see in Luke Luke let me just go back to Luke 22 I'll try to bring this down to close here Luke 22 28. it's a simple thought but I just want to bring this out here just meant a lot to me when I was studying here with 22 28. Jesus rewards those who are faithful to her endure Temptations I thought was very fitting you know we ended last Wednesday night's service with we're not saved by our feelings our feelings are some of the biggest Liars that we hear at any day our feelings right because it can feel good to have another or to have some extra chocolate but it's going to be good for you it can feel good to open up a Cold Mountain Dew but is it good for you it can feel good to go to handles and get the extra scoop of ice cream but it could be good for you right feelings are the last thing right that's the last thing you want to trust is feelings we want to base our faith upon God's promises praise God because this whole world is based upon natural laws and if the whole world is based on natural laws then the whole universe is based on God's spiritual laws right we see the natural laws of work if if that's the case how much more are the spiritual laws at work Hallelujah and I love the part that Jesus said I saw you as you stayed with me in my Temptations you weren't unseen it didn't go Heaven's radar didn't miss the fact right that you stayed with Christ Hallelujah might have felt like that there was definitely some tests and trials right right your Leader's a blasphemer he's a BL he's a uh he's a devil he makes people mad people want to throw him they people want to kill him they want to throw him off cliffs he's a rebel whatever they'd say oh the whole group group of preachers is leaving because of his Doctrine but really it was the right Doctrine they had the wrong Doctrine but Jesus saw the whole time who was faithful and who was not so it is today I want to read now we read 28 year they which have continued with me in my Temptations and what does he say and I appoint unto you a kingdom as my father had the point unto me well so now we get this concept about Rewards if you can stay with Christ in the midst of Temptations Christ will appoint you a level of reward if you can endure the Temptations If you can go through the fires and not and not recant and leave the test of life and and speak against the truth if you can go through the fires then you'll be appointed a great reward on the other side praise God that's good you can just endure it's never going to be easy it's going to be hard no right everybody thought the disciples were crazy everybody thought everybody spoke against them they weren't not a popular group no they feared for their lives so much so on the day of Pentecost they were hiding away for 10 days that's good hiding from the cops for 10 days until the Holy Ghost came amen goodness we're not the popular people no no but they stayed with the word and Jesus said because you endured these Temptations these trials I because you endure what was appointed for you I'll appoint the rewards for you as well Hallelujah Hallelujah what is this Kingdom Jesus you're going to eat and drink at my table In My Kingdom in that beautiful Church we're not going to eat at Joe Biden's table I could put anybody in there you want I could put Ronald Reagan in there if you like I can put George Washington in there we're not going to eat at his table the table is not his the table is the savior's table right Hallelujah it ain't going to be let me say this and they're going to be brother Ram's table it's gonna be Jesus Christ Hallelujah right it ain't going to be my table it's going to be Christ's table Hallelujah see if we're faithful to Christ if we can stand with Christ in the midst of our Temptations we're standing for him praise God when we do it to the least of these is Brethren we're doing it unto him it says he says when you do it to me you sit at my table praise God amen because you endure these trials and these tests then you sit at my table because this was my plan I allowed I ordained this was this was these were my tests that I allowed in your life because it would produce the character of Christ in your life you went through the fires I appointed for you and now I point for you the rewards you get to eat and drink at my table so because they because they dealt with being called a blasphemer because they dealt with uh Jesus being called a devil Jesus says because you went through that and suffered through that I'll eat with you you'll have a place with me at my table see we've got to withstand all the words and all the accusations all the attacks all the lies against us we've got to withstand all that and then Christ says I'll eat with you in the New Kingdom I'll eat and drink Hallelujah and then these 11 with the 12th either Matthias or Paul probably Paul but these 12 would judge the 12 tribes of Israel they would be judges over Israel God's people Jesus's apostles would judge the nation of Israel now Church you know this they were far from perfect I hope this thing blesses somebody's heart tonight amen because this blessed my heart these disciples were not perfect people they were arguing I'm greater than you right my Ministry is way greater than your S no it's not mine's Mine mine's greater no don't let the kids keep the kids away keep them from Jesus don't don't Jesus don't want to hold the babies you just don't want to anoint your your babies he doesn't want to do that all their all their trials they were not perfect they said Jesus you want to call down fire from heaven and destroy all these Sinners let's burn them up and send them to early hell well well Jesus said you don't even know what Spirit you're of right and then they didn't have faith sometimes to pray for the sick or they couldn't cast out some devils they they wouldn't speak to the storm Jesus said oh faith is Generation he's talking to his disciples to church let's be encouraged we may not have the faith we may get caught up in Pride we may have struggles God doesn't ask us to be perfect in ourselves God asks us to Faithfully follow him and stay with him throughout our trials and temptations amen he asked us to trust in the process amen he asked us to have joy in the journey can I say it like that Hallelujah he just asked us to endure to get through it praise God he doesn't ask us for Perfection Nobody's Perfect all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God but all can be forgiven by the Holy Spirit Hallelujah by the blood of Christ amen all can be forgiven Hallelujah God knows God does not require Perfection he requires you to stay with him how many staying with him Hallelujah I'm not leaving Jesus I don't know where else would I go you think I'd fit in as a Catholic priest too late I got eight kids already Hallelujah you think I've been in as a Pentecostal I don't think so they say speak in tongues brother Jesse I only if God sends it I do it if God does it but I'm going to pretend that's what that's what they did to my friends in college they would stick the preacher would stick it right there and say speak in tongues show us you've got the tongues like I can carry God in my pocket and say yeah yeah I'll just bring out God's Gift whenever I want we just read Jesus couldn't even do it Jesus couldn't do all the things in Nazareth he couldn't heal all the lepers he couldn't heal all the he couldn't feed all the uh all the beggars he could only do what the father showed him how many know God has a higher plan than what we said that what we see many times he's always working he doesn't ask us to understand it he asked us to trust him Hallelujah and Jesus said they that endure to the end they shall be saved hallelujah what a reminder for us and of course we know Jesus said I went over these scriptures with brother Chris in the Bible Study last week Jesus said to he the overcometh he said I'll Grant him a rod of iron that they'll rule over Nations right he said if you're faithful with 10 talents you'll rule over 10 cities if you're faithful with five talents you'll rule over five cities the church really as men brother Austin Broadway we just got to rule over our homes if we can rule over our homes praise God hallelujah then we can rule over the gifts in our lives then think about that we'll double our gifts we'll double our Tales right now me I've got to rule my home church and the gifts and talents in my life Hallelujah so I got at least three I think I imagine I don't know I don't know how that works but I got to be faithful I'm not going to be perfect I just got to stay with it amen it's just like the stock market brother I was just listening to some stock market things this week the overall trend of the stock market is up it's going to have some dips but if you just stay with it you're going to get rewarded is that right anyone that stayed with it over the last hundred years they've made great great dividends well that's how it is our lives are like the stock market right sometimes they go up sometimes they go down but overall we're constantly Rising amen going higher raising in faith overcoming more more than conquerors in Christ Jesus amen we're not falling away we're not losing our faith we're not losing our confidence we're trusting God Amen we're trusting God hallelujah I'm not selling out my stock in Jesus amen hallelujah I'm buying more stock in Christ Hallelujah amen Hallelujah it was great rewards Church to those who endure to those who are faithful to those who continue with Christ in the midst of your Temptations how many are more determined than ever to stay with Christ Hallelujah amen again he said ye are they which have continue with me in my Temptations Jesus was all alone on the cross even forsaken by God but he'll reward all those who stuck by him during all his other trials all his other Temptations so we what do we learn from this that we've got to stay with one another in the midst of our trials like I said church if you need help you need to reach out to somebody for prayer the Bible said confess your faults one to another right and the Bible also says if you want a friend you've got to show yourself friendly that's right friendship is a two-way street well brother Jess you haven't uh reached out to me in a while when was the last time you reached out to me well just you really need to encourage me when was the last time you encouraged me you know what I mean it works both ways right and I want to encourage you I want you to encourage me but see how the enemy will try to attack us but see if if we all love the Lord Jesus Christ we'll look at all the trials of our life and we'll see oh my brother's trying my sister's trying we'll see I'm trying I'm not perfect my brother's not perfect my sister's not perfect but we're all trying we're enduring and we will help each other through these Temptations Hallelujah and then church there's a great reward at the end there's a great reward at the end look at this Paul said I commend unto you Phoebe our sister which is a servant of the church which is that centria so Paul knew this this is the church she's a servant to everybody else that's the reputation she gained over the time when she was at this church in Rome she was a servant to the church we should all strive to be servants that you receive her in the Lord as we come as Saints and that you assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you now here's her business she was trying to secure others which means help them heal them provide for their needs so Paul says here's a sister she's leading this ministry of helping all the people meet their needs he said assist her because she's the leader in it the same preaching the same Bible studies the same song service this is helping people with food shelter clothing and Paul said all you other Saints you need to go help that sister because notice yeah right whatever whatever is business the business food shelter clothing for she has been a Sakura many end of who of myself look at that she helped out the preacher when he needed help this is her testimony right in other words Glory in other words she was there when people were going through trials sure she was she was there to secure she was there to help people right when they were struggling oh yeah yeah and not just the sisters Paul too right Paul too yeah how many believe there's a great reward for sister Phoebe in heaven oh yeah I imagine she's got a great reward up there if she was faithful with all the talents now look it looks like looks looks like shirt she's pretty it looks like she's pretty faithful how many people did she help out a few in the church and Paul makes a note to say she was a helper of many she was constantly helping people so help assist her she's the leader in that Ministry of the food and shelter and clothing she's the leader in that you just help her out and you'll have a great reward too how many believe that by God's grace now here I love this for in that he himself has suffered being tempted he is able to secure them that are tempted so Jesus can secure us as well he can meet our needs he can help us in the midst of our trials because he went through trials so see church now we get now we have a we have a good point either God will use somebody to help you in your trial or the Lord Jesus will come and help you in your trial but either way it's Jesus amen it was Jesus and Phoebe amen and it was Jesus helped Paul and other times too it was Jesus the help Paul right here at first no man stood with me but all men forsook me I pray God that it may be not laid to their charge notwithstanding the Lord stood with me and strengthened me praise God no man so Phoebe wasn't there in this trial thank God she helped many people but see the church there's going to be times when you're isolated man there's gonna be times you're isolated there ain't going to be some other somebody there to help you but you got to trust that Christ will be there to help you praise God we have to trust it Christ will be there because he's still with Paul he'll stand with you praise God and the myth in the midst of your trials all right isn't that beautiful so the Lord Jesus Will secure you in the midst of your trials he'll either do it by the Holy Spirit or he'll do it through some other brother or sister and the sister said you don't have to just be a brother every time to be a sister now I'm bringing this I'm going to close to this I'm just bringing this out I preach this in the pride series overcoming Pride it's not if you'll battle Pride it's when you'll battle Pride so it's not if you're going to go through a Temptation it's when are you going to go through it and church like I said our church is kind of in the midst of that right now we're in the midst of the trial and we got overcome by the blood of the Lamb in the word of Our Testimony now you might remember this I'm going to skip past that but there's these two books that we've read at our home actually we're listening to the audiobook I don't know have we read them all at home too these two books are beautiful books from the 1800s but in each book these two books there's a giant killer and there's sir Knight The Splendid way in each book it's an allegory of a knight who's got to overcome all these Giants in other words all these trials all these Temptations it's a beautiful allegory that in our lives we have Giants that we have to defeat it's not all flowery bed of these life isn't always a picnic now thank God there's times we're hedged about and we rejoice in those seasons but in each time I think it's interesting and each time the night here what was his name again fight us the night here had to face sloth laziness one on one then he had to face the giant of selfishness one on one isolated but church he wasn't really alone because he had the armor of God on Amen Hallelujah he had the armor of God that the king gave to him Hallelujah in other words we've got the sword of the spirit which is the Holy Spirit and the holy spirit's God how many can say Amen to that the holy spirit is God and how do you defeat the giant of untruth By The Sword of the spirit how did he defeat the giant hate through the sword of the spirit and the last one how did he defeat the giant Pride through the sword of the spirit of course through humility now this one's fresh on my mind because I listened to it this week I took the kids out on a few errands this week this is my favorite Lamplighter book of all time constant is the name of this Knight and the first Temptation after he gets the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the chapel which is a type of the church he's tempted to turn back before he even starts out on the journey and then his his next battle is he's got to overcome the deception to not fight at all that there's no need to fight and you can live a life of frolic right like there's no more battles anymore right that's that's the people in the message that say we're in the Millennium that's basically what that is and they're deceived right we're in the midst of a battle we're in the mid we're still overcoming later to see you praise God there's only peace in our souls everywhere else we look is battles and tests and trials Temptations the third battle was isolation jealousy of a brother and when he got jealous of the brother uh the devil tricked him to isolate himself he left the fellowship now that's like people leaving church right they'll isolate themselves away from the body and then you got he got teamed up by all these demon powers but then the Holy Spirit led the brothers to come rescue him amen the love of the love of God brought rescue from the Saints so see it's a it's a body Ministry praise God we help one another we encourage one another praise God like brother Adam said we're only as strong as our weakest Christian God make us strong Hallelujah help me not to be the weak link help me to be the strong link praise God Hallelujah and then I thought it was fitting too he lost he lost a loved one sir ardent he had to deal with the death of a loved one like our sisters are he had to go through that and this is a beautiful allegory all Christians go through these things right we all battle jealousy we all battle laziness we all better we all battle given up we all battle the death of loved one at some point and then we battled the sorrow and pain we go through sorrows and pains that sometimes we we don't even know how we'll get through it but in each case he gets through it by saying the name of the king amen Hallelujah just like us we overcome every trial through the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's what I love what Peter said after that man got healed he said do you think we by our power or are by name has made this man whole he said by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth this man stands before you whole and there's no other name given under Heaven whereby men must be saved amen then he had to overcome he was actually the one who caused he was trying to get an older Knight to accept the Praises of men and actually led to his death so that's a a test of pride he had he was testing him to leave his position right the praise of men the Bible said they're lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God and then the second to last test was the question that's where we're at today with the message all these questions about the message are you sure brother man was a prophet are you sure the message is right are you sure there's going to be a Rapture are you sure all these questions well let me tell you I got every answer right here in the Bible for you come look at if you want to but I find out they just want to ask questions they don't actually want to know the answers that's what I found they ask a lot of questions but they shut up and leave me alone when I tell them the answers yeah that's exactly right and the last battle this uh this night constant battle was the temptation to retire in ease rather than ending his life laboring for other people so again bearing one another's burdens and of course he overcame that Temptation and he took up the burden and he won the Victory and then he wakes up into King City praise God he he makes it to Heaven by God's grace but church he had to endure every one of these uh Giants he had to endure every one of these tests now there were great seasons in between there there's great seasons of going into the gardens and enjoying the fragrances there was great scenes of Fellowship where there was an awful lot of Trials like I told brother amen when I was praying for him yesterday I said many are the afflictions of the righteous the Bible didn't say for you the Bible said many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivers them out of all of them praise God how many believe that by God's grace many are the afflictions many are The Temptations the trials that we go through but the Lord will deliver us out of everyone Hallelujah so there's my last one the Victorious Knight's name was constant in other words you must just constantly keep the faith just endure just overcome don't turn your back on Christ what's Revelation 17 14 say these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord of lords and king of kings and they that are with Jesus Christ are called to be of Jesus Christ they're chosen to be with Jesus Christ and they're faithful to Jesus Christ how many are faithful to Jesus Christ tonight amen let's stand musicians could come praise God I'm going to be a constant follower of Christ I'm going to Faithfully follow Christ no matter what the trial no matter what the Temptation I'm going on with Christ hallelujah praise God just play that I have decided to follow Jesus praise God let's bow our heads here for a word of Prayer [Music] Hallelujah father God we give you praise tonight God give you praise honor and Glory Lord you don't expect this to be perfect Lord God you expect us to endure Hallelujah you expect us to stay with you we expect us to be faithful to be constant Hallelujah to not desert to not run away but to stay faithful to stay true to our God lord we've decided we're not turning back to the world hallelujah we're decided we're Going Home With Jesus hallelujah hallelujah when the battle's over we shall wear a crowd amen Jerusalem Lord we see ourselves in the midst of this trial Lord God we ask for your grace and strength in the midst of this foreign [Music] Lord to stay with the word to believe the word to quote the word hallelujah and you will bless it dear God hallelujah I believe in your God as you have so many times

crown dear God now help us in the Battle of your God help us to pick up our swords as those illustrations as those allegories showed let us speak the name of Jesus foreign which is the word of God

ask all this in Jesus Christ's name
