[2:28] God so I have a few uh slides here Casa
[2:31] by God's grace you can switch over when
[2:32] you're
[2:33] ready look at part two here I've been um
[2:36] enjoying this little study here I've
[2:38] read through the entire book of First
[2:39] Corinthians and I'm almost through 2
[2:40] Corinthians it's been a great review and
[2:43] of course listening to God's Prophet
[2:44] preach about uh Corinthians book of
[2:46] Correction uh from 1957 a wonderful
[2:49] message there by the grace of God
[2:52] hallelujah if you weren't here Wednesday
[2:53] you know we end the sermon with showing
[2:55] how um brother brandham said the whole
[2:58] idea around the Corinthian Church he
[3:00] said they were always looking for a
[3:02] sensation always looking for a dream or
[3:04] a prophecy or a tongue and he said they
[3:07] they they went too far on the sensations
[3:10] and he said they were missing the anchor
[3:12] of Love Hallelujah brother Ram said it
[3:15] six times he said our anchor is the love
[3:18] of Jesus Christ Hallelujah so uh we got
[3:21] a get a great lesson here there's lots
[3:23] of different kinds of churches you know
[3:24] we went through uh Wednesday night how
[3:26] uh leevan impacts every church but every
[3:29] Church Must Purge it out praise God and
[3:32] uh the the thing that will do that is
[3:33] love love purges out a church Hallelujah
[3:36] the love of God the love of God keeps
[3:38] the church clean Hallelujah so uh we
[3:41] kind of want to build off of that by
[3:42] God's grace and start reading into
[3:43] chapter one uh you'll see why I kind of
[3:45] go a certain direction here in a little
[3:47] bit uh by the grace of God let me start
[3:49] my timer here it's been a while since I
[3:51] remembered to set my timer just been
[3:54] preaching long and hard here praise God
[3:56] so so I want to look at again uh
[3:58] Scofield's outline of the epistle uh
[4:00] today we're going to get into Parts one
[4:02] and two Lord willing here uh by the
[4:04] grace of God uh the believer standing in
[4:06] Grace is the first nine verses and then
[4:09] uh he begins the first kind of uh rebuke
[4:12] or the first problem in the church the
[4:14] carnal state of the Corinthians here he
[4:17] begins it in verse 10 we're going to
[4:18] look at that here briefly and then he
[4:20] has to deal with sexual immorality and
[4:22] how to handle one's body the sanctity of
[4:24] the human body and of course marriage
[4:27] and then he looks at Christian Liberty
[4:29] for three chapters there 8 n and 10 and
[4:32] then headship uh with uh Christ you know
[4:36] under the headship of the father and
[4:38] woman under man and the Lord's Supper of
[4:40] course we call that hair hair chapter
[4:42] there hair is the outward sign of the ex
[4:44] of the expression of uh headship in the
[4:47] lives of Christians always has been
[4:49] Hallelujah and then the Lord's Supper
[4:51] which we took last week Hallelujah and
[4:53] then spiritual gifts in charity that's
[4:55] kind of the the point brother Brandon
[4:56] made when he preached on this the anchor
[4:59] is God 's love Hallelujah and then he
[5:01] looks at resurrections there was
[5:02] questions about resurrections in the
[5:04] Corinthian Church and then he gives
[5:06] closing instructions and greetings but
[5:08] I'd like to begin with the origin of the
[5:09] church so if you have your Bible go to
[5:11] Acts chapter 18 verse1 we're going to uh
[5:13] start there and just look at the origin
[5:15] of the
[5:16] church in
[5:20] Corinth
[5:23] Hallelujah so Acts chapter 18 verse one
[5:27] now these things are to encourage us you
[5:29] know
[5:30] uh you know you come to church to have
[5:32] God minister to your needs right we come
[5:34] here to worship God to give him glory
[5:36] Hallelujah and so uh you know we the
[5:38] best thing we can do is try to apply
[5:40] these scriptures to our lives how does
[5:41] this apply to us well in this case we
[5:44] can see how God started the Corinthian
[5:45] Church and then we can see how God
[5:47] started the akan church praise God or
[5:49] whatever Church you first came in the
[5:51] message uh how did God start the Ghan
[5:52] Church you know you can you can look at
[5:54] that and you see the same God doing the
[5:56] same things Hallelujah and so we want to
[5:59] look at that and just appreciate that
[6:00] today uh we get a good understanding of
[6:03] uh the church and what they struggled
[6:05] through uh and how God strengthened them
[6:08] and how God helped them Hallelujah so
[6:10] Acts chapter 18 verse1 this is called
[6:12] Paul at Corinth according to scoffield
[6:14] after these things Paul departed from
[6:15] Athens and came to Corinth and found a
[6:17] certain Jew named Aquilla born in pontis
[6:20] lately come from Italy with his wife
[6:22] Priscilla because that Claudius had
[6:24] commanded all Jews to depart from Rome
[6:26] so look at the political pressure they
[6:28] lived under they were were kicked out of
[6:30] their land right by the leading
[6:33] politician of their day but see God was
[6:35] behind that you know we might feel sorry
[6:37] for ourselves why do I have to move or
[6:39] why do I have to have this moving cost
[6:40] or why does this have to happen to me
[6:42] but God was doing something if it didn't
[6:44] happen they never would have met the
[6:46] prophet of God hallelujah if 911 never
[6:49] happened Simon would not have went to
[6:51] that Bible study for the message The
[6:52] Message Bible study that's what drove
[6:54] Simon to go to The Message Bible study
[6:57] was 911 he thought the end of the world
[6:59] was here wow right but we know we're in
[7:01] the last age Hallelujah no man knows the
[7:03] day or the hour so see all these things
[7:05] political all you know no matter what
[7:07] Satan tries to design God is in control
[7:10] God makes all things work to His Glory
[7:12] Hallelujah so you can be kicked out of a
[7:14] city because you're a chrisan you could
[7:15] be kicked out of anywhere but God is
[7:18] with you and God will use it to bring
[7:19] you to the truth if you desire the truth
[7:22] hallelujah and no doubt uh Aquilla and
[7:25] Priscilla desire the truth they've been
[7:27] kicked out of Rome Just because their
[7:29] Rel religious beliefs now Church there
[7:31] may come a time you've heard uh whispers
[7:33] about Civil War in America there may
[7:35] come a time we might have to flee Ohio
[7:36] I'm just saying and you never know right
[7:38] you never know think of the saints that
[7:40] lived through the Civil War back in the
[7:42] 1800s who would have thought they would
[7:43] ever have to suffer through through
[7:45] these things we don't know what's coming
[7:47] we don't know what tomorrow holds but
[7:48] what do we know God Holds Tomorrow
[7:51] hallelujah amen just remember these
[7:53] Bible days repeat brother R tells us
[7:55] that the Bible tells us that compound
[7:57] prophecies right scripture repeats
[8:00] itself Hallelujah so we just got to be
[8:02] ready for anything and know that
[8:03] whatever God allows God is right by our
[8:05] side he's the God who sees Hallelujah
[8:08] anybody still remember El Rio by God's
[8:10] grace Hallelujah the God who sees you
[8:12] Hallelujah he knows the hairs on your
[8:14] head Hallelujah he sees your uh your
[8:16] down uh sitting and your Uprising
[8:18] Hallelujah he does not Slumber or sleep
[8:21] Hallelujah God doesn't take a break on
[8:23] your life God loves you Hallelujah he's
[8:25] watching over you Hallelujah but he's
[8:27] got to mold our character at the same
[8:28] time and he says the best way to get
[8:30] character is through suffering
[8:32] hallelujah amen it's not through uh all
[8:34] the
[8:35] blessings Hallelujah through suffering
[8:38] uh Jesus learned obedience verse three
[8:41] and because he was of the same craft he
[8:43] Abode with them and wrought and worked
[8:46] for by their occupation they were tent
[8:48] makers so again through his personal job
[8:52] he met another believer how many
[8:54] Christians have a been able to witness
[8:55] to by God's grace you know you just get
[8:58] to witness of them because you're job
[8:59] leads you to them right I've had three
[9:01] or four friends come to our church just
[9:03] because uh we met them in cople you know
[9:06] so God uses your occupation he uses the
[9:08] political climate of the day he uses all
[9:11] these things to forward his message amen
[9:14] thank God the message came to us
[9:15] hallelujah that's what I can say today
[9:18] Hallelujah verse four now here we get to
[9:20] the founding of the church and he
[9:22] reasoned their synagogue every Sabbath
[9:24] that would be pretty wonderful Church
[9:25] setting wouldn't it like in in other
[9:27] words the Jewish synagogue they
[9:28] encouraged to debate every
[9:30] Saturday that would be like at our
[9:32] church if in the second service I said
[9:34] okay it's time for a bait I'll stand
[9:35] here who wants to debate me and heathens
[9:38] would walk in Muslims would walk in you
[9:40] know isn't that something the Jews were
[9:43] open to that he debated every
[9:45] synagogue Hallelujah now we tried a
[9:48] couple years ago didn't we brother
[9:49] William we tried to go and just try to
[9:50] be a light and every time I leave an
[9:52] envelope with this is for the pastor
[9:54] with my contact information I got to
[9:57] give out a few books there by God's
[9:58] grace
[10:00] so I just I I want to reach out to them
[10:02] when I can by God's grace Hallelujah but
[10:05] he would reason every Sabbath so every
[10:07] Saturday was debate day for Paul that's
[10:10] why we talk about those Street Preachers
[10:11] that's why we admire their courage don't
[10:12] we to get out there in front of the
[10:14] whole
[10:15] world and persuaded the Jews and Greeks
[10:18] and when Silas and timotheus had were
[10:20] come from Macedonia Paul was pressed in
[10:22] the
[10:23] spirit and testified to the Jews that
[10:26] Jesus was Christ have you ever had that
[10:29] God presses something on you where you
[10:31] just can't get away from it God is
[10:33] pressing this on you that's what I
[10:35] normally see with my sermons you know
[10:36] God will press that thought of the God
[10:38] who sees or he'll press a certain
[10:39] thought on about partial fear of the
[10:41] Lord or whatever it is the fear of the
[10:43] Lord God and I feel like it's oppressed
[10:44] right on my soul
[10:47] hallelujah or God might lead you to do
[10:49] something that's maybe outside the
[10:50] ordinary it's God moving each individual
[10:54] as they feel led right right each man
[10:57] brother man said has each man and woman
[10:59] has to find the mystery of God for their
[11:01] life the mystery of his will Hallelujah
[11:03] and so that's how God worked with Paul
[11:05] God pressed things on his spirit so this
[11:07] these things would be on his mind right
[11:09] sister Anna you know these these dreams
[11:11] would be on his mind and all these
[11:12] situations would be on his mind and then
[11:14] God would open something
[11:17] up you know I was just thinking about
[11:19] that and then this happened right God
[11:21] gives you two or three
[11:23] Witnesses right but God didn't stop
[11:25] there as we'll see later God gives him
[11:26] Visions God gives him dreams Hallelujah
[11:30] see church we have to recognize that
[11:31] sometimes God is going to press
[11:32] something on our spirit we just have to
[11:35] check it with the word make sure it's
[11:37] the word hallelujah make sure it's not a
[11:39] lying Spirit or something like that
[11:41] right or a lustful Spirit or a prideful
[11:43] arrogant Spirit or something like that
[11:44] by God's grace
[11:46] Hallelujah now he says verse six and
[11:49] when they opposed themselves and
[11:51] blasphemed he shook his reignment and
[11:53] said to them your blood be upon your own
[11:55] heads I am clean from henceforth I will
[11:57] go into the Gentiles so Paul had enough
[12:00] it was pressed on him to minister to the
[12:02] Jews and after they started blaspheming
[12:03] he said that's enough I'm done with the
[12:05] Jews see God will give you a witness
[12:08] when it's time to be done with something
[12:11] right God gave him a witness he tried it
[12:13] was pressed on the spirit he preached
[12:14] there every Saturday he would debate
[12:17] every Saturday but then God helped him
[12:19] realize okay this is time to be done
[12:21] with this we're moving on to something
[12:22] else Hallelujah remember he'd also had
[12:25] this calling from God he was a teacher
[12:27] of the Gentiles the Bible says Jesus
[12:29] said I'm going to send you to those who
[12:31] are in darkness that God might give you
[12:33] a great light hallelujah amen what a
[12:35] light the gospel is amen the light of
[12:37] Jesus Christ what a light Hallelujah
[12:40] verse seven and he departed then and
[12:42] entered into a certain man's house named
[12:44] justice and we met a Justice at
[12:45] taekwondo didn't we so I was I was
[12:47] saying Lord give me another witness if
[12:48] this is something I'm supposed to do
[12:49] here I was think about that this morning
[12:52] one that worshiped God whose house
[12:54] joined hard to the synagogue so I like
[12:57] that even though he was rejected there
[12:58] was some somebody right next door
[13:00] somebody was getting convinced while the
[13:02] majority rejected him God had a little
[13:05] group there
[13:06] hallelujah
[13:09] hallelujah verse eight and Christmas the
[13:11] chief ruler of the synagogue believed on
[13:13] the Lord with all of his house so while
[13:15] most Jews blashe what Paul said he got a
[13:18] very prominent person to join the
[13:20] message
[13:22] Hallelujah glory to God so this would
[13:25] cause a great stir right a major leader
[13:28] in the Jewish Church came out of the
[13:30] Jewish church and joined the Christian
[13:33] church and it caused a stir Hallelujah
[13:37] now I did just a bit of studying on this
[13:39] on the history um the Roman Emperor
[13:42] rebuilt Corinth it was destroyed in BC
[13:45] time uh the Roman Emperor rebuilt it and
[13:47] it became so great with trade uh and
[13:50] commerce as we said on Wednesday that uh
[13:52] there it's estimated they had over
[13:54] 800,000 people in this city this is a
[13:56] pretty massive City and remember
[13:59] remember uh it said that when anybody
[14:01] would talk about the Corinthians uh they
[14:03] would use the name Corinthian like a
[14:04] slander like hippie or Heathen or
[14:07] something like that right or a woke
[14:09] person so and uh I heard another
[14:11] preacher say even in all the plays and
[14:13] you know because Greeks had
[14:15] amphitheaters and plays in all the plays
[14:17] whenever they had a Corinthian character
[14:19] he was a drunk or she was a drunk
[14:21] because it was a city of
[14:23] debauchery right that's why Paul had to
[14:25] say adulterers fornicators drunkards uh
[14:28] homos uals will not inherit the kingdom
[14:30] of God that's why I to say that because
[14:33] the city's surrounded by it oh but in
[14:35] the midst of the darkness God brought
[14:36] forth a great light Hallelujah and he
[14:38] said such were some of you but ye are
[14:41] washed Hallelujah you're Justified
[14:43] you're Sanctified by the spirit of our
[14:45] God Hallelujah by the Holy Ghost amen so
[14:48] God loves to go into darkness and Shine
[14:51] the great light of the
[14:53] Gospel thank God Amen Hallelujah but see
[14:57] he saves these prominent ones
[14:59] uh by God's
[15:02] grace Christus was the chief chief ruler
[15:04] finishing verse eight so 8 B and many of
[15:07] the Corinthians hearing him believed and
[15:09] were baptized so all the Jews reject him
[15:12] but when this one Jew who's a very
[15:14] prominent Jew gets saved it moves other
[15:17] Gentiles to receive him to receive
[15:20] Christ and they got baptized right there
[15:22] in the name of the Lord Jesus Hallelujah
[15:26] then spake the Lord to Paul in the Night
[15:28] by Vision what are his first three words
[15:31] Be not Afraid can I say it to you be Not
[15:34] Afraid Hallelujah if God's called you to
[15:37] akan if God's called you to do your
[15:38] ministry God will back you up hallelujah
[15:41] or he'll give you some type of warning
[15:43] that it's time to suffer it's time to be
[15:44] persecuted but he tells Paul don't worry
[15:47] about your physical state don't worry
[15:49] about the persecution don't you oh how
[15:52] loving is Jesus hallelujah how kind is
[15:55] Jesus even God sent Moses and Elijah to
[15:57] talk to Jesus before his cruci fiction
[15:59] Hallelujah so before persecution would
[16:02] set in oh and how many times did Paul
[16:03] get warned he got warned by agabus and
[16:05] all these different prophets you're
[16:07] going to Rome to give your life but Paul
[16:09] said it doesn't move me anymore I'm
[16:11] willing to my the time of my departure
[16:13] is at hand I'm willing to be a sacrifice
[16:15] an offering for Jesus
[16:17] hallelujah what encouragement to us
[16:19] Church be not afraid but speak and hold
[16:22] not thy peace remember he'd already uh
[16:25] been rejected by the Jews they
[16:26] blasphemed and so he was a little afraid
[16:28] about should where should I preach how
[16:30] much should I preach but Jesus sayso not
[16:32] be afraid preach the word verse 10 for I
[16:37] am with thee who better could be with
[16:39] you and I than Christ
[16:42] Hallelujah sometimes church we need a
[16:44] reminders that the the one with us is
[16:46] the greatest one there could be Nobody
[16:49] Greater with you than the Lord Jesus
[16:51] Christ Hallelujah for I'm with thee and
[16:54] no man shall set on thee to hurt thee
[16:57] what a promise
[16:59] for I have much people in this city so
[17:02] Jesus says don't fear I'm with you
[17:05] preach the word I'm going to give you
[17:07] many souls in this city
[17:10] Hallelujah and he continued there a year
[17:13] and six months teaching the word of God
[17:16] among them Hallelujah so here we see a
[17:20] supernatural testimony God gives a dream
[17:23] right and God backs up the dream do you
[17:26] remember Steve Alexander he said for 10
[17:29] years he had prayed God would raise up a
[17:31] church in
[17:32] akan 10 years Hallelujah so what did God
[17:36] do did God hear his
[17:37] prayer 10 years before I got here amen
[17:40] he was already praying God raise up a
[17:42] church in a raise up and his relatives
[17:44] some of them have even come to the
[17:45] church I remember one time I preached
[17:48] specifically on Martin Luther and John
[17:49] Wesley and we talked his his uh
[17:51] relative's name was Daniel after service
[17:53] and I tried all I could do to convince
[17:54] him and talk to him and emailed him over
[17:56] and over again and the ball was left in
[17:58] his Court to get back to me to prove if
[18:01] what I said was true or not so it must
[18:03] have been true because he never got back
[18:04] with me but for 10 years he prayed God
[18:07] raised up a church and here we stand
[18:09] we're raised up by the grace of God
[18:11] hallelujah Still Standing on the
[18:13] Promises of God
[18:15] hallelujah the Gates of Hell cannot
[18:17] Prevail against this Revelation
[18:19] Hallelujah that's right church amen
[18:22] fight though he may Satan cannot Prevail
[18:24] against the Church of the Living God
[18:26] hallelujah cuz why Jesus is with us
[18:28] Hallelujah and he has people in this
[18:30] city I don't know if we got much in this
[18:32] city but we got some and some's better
[18:34] than none
[18:36] Hallelujah glory to God all right now
[18:38] read through that so now we can see the
[18:41] spiritual uh start of the church now I'm
[18:44] going to skip down to the first
[18:46] correction so back to 1 Corinthians 1 if
[18:48] you would because I'm going to end with
[18:50] uh the beginning of the the chapter
[18:52] little little backwards but I'm that's
[18:54] how I'm going to do it today I felt led
[18:55] to do
[18:57] that my God Grace so let's look at the
[19:00] first correction here verse
[19:03] 10 now I beseech you Brethren by the
[19:05] name of our Lord Jesus Christ so now I
[19:08] like it he gives nine verses of
[19:10] encouragement but then in verse
[19:12] 10 kind of like when our girls have
[19:14] those pen
[19:15] pals you know all starts with all the
[19:19] nice things at the front that's what
[19:20] Paul starts his letters all the nice
[19:21] things at the
[19:22] front Hallelujah now I beseech you
[19:25] Brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus
[19:27] Christ that you all speak the same thing
[19:30] and that there be no divisions among you
[19:32] but that you be perfectly joined
[19:34] together in the same mind and the same
[19:37] judgment and let's apply that to
[19:39] ourselves what do each person here what
[19:41] do we want to happen today we should
[19:44] want the same thing today Hallelujah we
[19:47] should have the same thing in mind that
[19:49] Christ might be
[19:50] glorified if you paid attention uh uh
[19:53] remember these prayer requests we should
[19:54] pray for these we should have that mind
[19:56] God minister to the sick and the hurting
[19:58] be with The Travelers uh whatever the
[20:01] the need of is the church at The Hour
[20:03] That should be our mind the same mind
[20:05] Hallelujah the same judgment
[20:07] Hallelujah but see Satan brings
[20:09] divisions right and so we're we're we're
[20:12] mindful of that and Paul gives us that
[20:14] that's the first issue that he addresses
[20:17] is
[20:17] division people have different things on
[20:20] their mind well I got that on my mind I
[20:21] got that and just 180 degrees different
[20:24] people are thinking about different
[20:25] things we should all be thinking about
[20:27] the same thing Hallelujah
[20:30] and where did Paul hear about it look at
[20:31] this verse 11 for it have been declared
[20:33] unto me of you my brethren by them which
[20:35] are of the House of Khloe that there are
[20:38] contentions among you so this was some
[20:41] this was a problem that uh kept going on
[20:43] there was divisions and contentions
[20:45] between groups in the church now this I
[20:48] say that every one of you saith I'm a
[20:50] Paul so now we get down to the depths of
[20:52] what it
[20:53] was you had all these Believers one says
[20:56] I'm a Paul Paul I got saved in Paul's
[21:00] Ministry one said I got saved in
[21:02] Apollo's
[21:03] Ministry another one said I'm a Peter
[21:06] he's got he's the rock he had the Keys
[21:08] of the Kingdom right so but it was
[21:12] division so they were all thinking oh
[21:14] they were thinking oh this church should
[21:15] have been run like Apollo's Church why
[21:18] isn't this church run like Peter's
[21:19] church because it ain't Peter's church
[21:21] it's Christ's Church right and then
[21:24] there was the Su here's the super
[21:25] spiritual group I'm just of Jesus I love
[21:27] Jesus
[21:29] that's the real spiritual group right
[21:31] there oh I I don't I don't need any man
[21:33] to teach me I I it's just I'm of
[21:37] Christ that's the real spiritual group
[21:40] right there you can't tell them nothing
[21:41] because I just follow
[21:45] Jesus sound similar to today well I'm of
[21:48] that brother's Church of that brother
[21:49] new brother Brandon and that one and
[21:51] this one and all these connections right
[21:55] people were taking pride in men rather
[21:57] than rejoicing ing in God he gets to at
[22:00] the end of the chapter he says he the
[22:02] glory needs the glory in Christ
[22:04] Hallelujah now you should respect the
[22:06] preachers you should respect all the
[22:07] preachers the Bible said give double
[22:08] honor to those who labor in the word of
[22:10] God in Doctrine but honor is not the
[22:12] same as
[22:13] praise hallelujah praise just means
[22:16] going over and above basically worship
[22:19] you want to honor and say thank God I
[22:21] appreciate a faithful Pastor I
[22:22] appreciate a faithful evangelist I
[22:24] appreciate a faithful prophet of God but
[22:26] we never go into praising them
[22:29] or or or just uh thinking that our main
[22:31] connection's with them our main
[22:33] connection is with Christ but this was
[22:36] this was the first problem he
[22:37] addresses there's divisions some people
[22:39] are minded like this well it should be
[22:41] like Paul said should be like Apollos
[22:43] should be like sephus well should just
[22:45] should be like Jesus said
[22:47] it and everybody was divided based upon
[22:50] their favorite message preacher I'll say
[22:52] like that
[22:55] Hallelujah so Paul asked him a good
[22:57] question is Christ of
[22:59] Ed
[23:00] Hallelujah was Paul crucified for
[23:04] you or were you baptized in the name of
[23:07] Paul no Christ is not divided Paul was
[23:10] not crucified for you you were not
[23:11] baptized in name of Paul right I thank
[23:15] God that I baptized none of you but
[23:17] chrispus and gas so this tells us quite
[23:19] a good testimony about these two
[23:21] brothers Paul said I'm glad I just
[23:22] baptized them because they're real solid
[23:25] and they don't worship other men right
[23:28] that's what he says so Paul says a lot
[23:29] of the church here was prone to
[23:32] worshiping a
[23:34] preacher they were prone to favor
[23:36] certain preachers
[23:38] Hallelujah he says but I'm thankful I
[23:41] know those two brothers are solid they
[23:42] won't get into this uh divisions about
[23:45] who's the greatest
[23:48] preacher lest any should say that I'd
[23:51] baptize in my own
[23:52] name so these people were so zealous for
[23:55] their favorite preacher some of them
[23:57] would go overboard and say well I was B
[23:58] baptized in the name of Apollos I was
[24:00] baptized taken away from Christ they
[24:03] were so into man worship it's like they
[24:06] worshiped every word he said on the tape
[24:07] or something like
[24:10] that because that's what some people do
[24:12] they baptize in the name of William
[24:13] brandham Brother Ram knew about it and
[24:15] he left the field in other words he left
[24:17] traveling for a little while until the
[24:19] problem was solved and it was in uh June
[24:21] of 1961 you can listen to it I preached
[24:23] it before but you can go back and listen
[24:24] to it I want you to see what brother mam
[24:26] said about Paul I like this speak a
[24:28] moment on faith cometh by hearing I love
[24:30] this word and the word of faith how many
[24:32] love the
[24:33] Bible now we think of Faith what it is
[24:36] Paul first speaking to the Romans which
[24:39] had been heathens and idolators had just
[24:40] come over into Christianity and here
[24:42] Paul is the greatest missionary the
[24:45] world has ever had since Christ here's
[24:48] what we got to remember we can't call
[24:50] ourselves ever the greatest but we can
[24:53] uh but we can let Jesus call us whatever
[24:54] he wants to call us that's right so
[24:56] other words Paul never said I'm the
[24:58] greatest he said I was the least of the
[25:00] Saints that's right Hallelujah but if
[25:03] other people want to say it fine as long
[25:05] as you're not worshiping and praising
[25:07] them could we say Paul was the greatest
[25:09] by honoring him certainly you know why
[25:12] church because he's got the
[25:14] resume that's right Hallelujah he's got
[25:17] a resume of suffering longer than I
[25:19] don't know longer than your grocery list
[25:22] right I'm talking about when you're low
[25:24] on
[25:25] groceries yep his list of suffering is
[25:27] so low
[25:29] that brother Ram could stand there and
[25:30] say he's the greatest missionary I like
[25:32] those last two words since
[25:35] Christ Hallelujah brother Braham would
[25:37] not worship a man Hallelujah this is why
[25:40] I can't believe some people say we're
[25:41] going to do Greater Works than Jesus if
[25:43] there's no greater missionary than Jesus
[25:45] how can you do a greater Miracle than
[25:48] Jesus I've yet to see any preacher today
[25:51] walk on
[25:52] water right I yet to see any preacher
[25:54] they raise a dead man after three days I
[25:57] have never seen it
[25:59] now they might have a testimony of
[26:00] somebody raised after 35 minutes of
[26:02] death or 10 minutes or maybe an hour
[26:04] I've never heard three days have you
[26:05] brother William been around the message
[26:07] over 40 years he's never heard it see so
[26:09] people they they go too far on certain
[26:12] ideas and and they forget that there
[26:14] could be nobody greater than Jesus amen
[26:17] but the Corinthians had had so majored
[26:19] on a man they were majoring on men
[26:22] rather than majoring on
[26:24] Christ they wanted to be divided they
[26:26] were trying purposely not not to be
[26:28] unified God help us to get into the
[26:30] unity of the holy spirit amen hallelujah
[26:34] they purposely would be divided well I'm
[26:36] of Apollos no no no no I'm a Paul the
[26:41] real saint of God who had the Damascus
[26:43] Road experience they were purposely
[26:46] trying to be divided God help us to be
[26:48] purposely United Hallelujah to lay aside
[26:51] our thoughts and our differences and our
[26:53] opinions that's what God honors God
[26:55] honors Unity hallelujah how many want to
[26:58] see uh the day of Pentecost take place
[27:00] again well what did the Bible say they
[27:03] were all in one place and all in one
[27:06] Accord if we want to see Power if we
[27:08] want to see God move if we want to see
[27:10] the spirit of God let's all start S
[27:12] thinking the same thing
[27:13] Hallelujah right not be divided but be
[27:16] United in Christ Jesus Hallelujah I like
[27:18] I said on Wednesday you know uh God will
[27:21] use me in different places we'll see
[27:22] Miracles and everything like that and
[27:24] it's all because people got in one
[27:26] Accord that's all it is we just got to
[27:28] get in one Accord Hallelujah I found a
[27:30] quote two weeks ago I haven't preached
[27:32] it yet but brother ad said where's the
[27:33] power in the church and he says where's
[27:35] the power to help women not to cut their
[27:39] hair he said where's the power for a
[27:41] woman to wipe the makeup off her face I
[27:43] said we got that power amen where's the
[27:47] power to make a man stop lusting after
[27:49] other women Hallelujah we've got the
[27:51] power Hallelujah in the name of Jesus
[27:54] most churches don't even have that power
[27:56] Hallelujah
[27:58] glory to God the greatest missionary now
[28:02] go to keep your place there but go to
[28:03] Luke 10 real quick Luke 10
[28:09] vers1 how did the greatest
[28:12] missionary operate his missionary work
[28:15] the Lord Jesus Christ Luke 10 vers1
[28:19] after these things the Lord appointed
[28:20] other 70 also and sent them two by two
[28:23] before his face into every city and
[28:25] place wither he himself would come
[28:29] so here's how the greatest missionary
[28:30] operated he he'd pray you know the Lord
[28:32] would pray he said maybe uh James and
[28:34] John you go to uh Damascus or Syria
[28:37] wherever wherever he send them right uh
[28:39] basa you know Tyrie whatever it is and
[28:43] he would pray and send two by two they
[28:45] would go there they' preach the gospel
[28:47] signs wonders and miracles would be done
[28:49] and they say but but but be encouraged a
[28:51] greater than uh John and uh and greater
[28:54] than Peter James and John is coming
[28:56] Jesus is coming Hallelujah so they were
[28:59] like the foraste God would send two at a
[29:01] time they were like the initial blast of
[29:03] the Holy Spirit and then they say but be
[29:05] encouraged Jesus is on the way that's
[29:08] that's how every one of us should
[29:10] operate we should do all that we can do
[29:12] but say whatever I lack Jesus will come
[29:14] behind and he'll bless it hallelujah
[29:17] amen this is how the greatest missionary
[29:20] worked he would send them two by two you
[29:22] go first and then I'll follow you up
[29:25] remember he said if they won't receive
[29:26] you he said Shake the Dust off your
[29:28] shoes it'll be more tolerable on a bunch
[29:31] of sodomites than for that City to turn
[29:34] on the gospel the New Testament gospel
[29:37] and all the signs Miracles and wonders
[29:39] devil casting out the prophecies it'd be
[29:42] more tolerable so in other words the
[29:44] sodomites are going to have a a more
[29:45] tolerable judgment in Hell than these
[29:47] cities that rejected Jesus and his
[29:50] Apostles what about
[29:52] today what about today when they reject
[29:54] the message for church
[29:56] entity right or worship worship
[29:58] tainment they reject Jesus in the
[30:01] message for worship tment to stay in
[30:03] their Creeds and their dogmas right and
[30:05] their sin loving societies that's really
[30:06] what they are but R said they're not
[30:08] saved they're just lodges they're sin
[30:10] loving lodges is what they are now
[30:12] there's a few saved in there thank God
[30:14] I'm trusting some of mine are saved in
[30:16] there Hallelujah my family I'm talking
[30:18] about
[30:19] Hallelujah but the majority right few
[30:23] there be that find
[30:25] it think of it that little Jewish
[30:28] brother so apparently Paul wasn't a big
[30:30] guy he couldn't set them still yet there
[30:33] was thousands in Jerusalem I'm sorry he
[30:35] just couldn't sit still there was
[30:37] thousands in Jerusalem hadn't been
[30:39] converted but he had to go somewhere
[30:40] else and somewhere else the whole world
[30:42] must hear the gospel as far as Paul
[30:43] could take it and how he did his best to
[30:47] bring it and his messages and his
[30:49] writing still lives on Immortal today
[30:52] because he spoke of Christ
[30:53] Jesus so whatever gift or whatever
[30:56] position God has given you you should
[30:58] have that same
[30:59] desire I just can't sit still like if
[31:02] you're a parent I can't sit sit still
[31:04] I've got to show love to my
[31:06] children I've got to show them more of
[31:08] the grace of God I got to keep teaching
[31:10] my children and grandchildren the word
[31:12] of God Amen I can't set still if I sing
[31:15] song specials I can't sit still I got to
[31:17] sing another special amen right I gotta
[31:20] glor of course it's got to be in a
[31:21] season right like as a preacher I can't
[31:24] sit still I got to get a sermon ready
[31:25] for Sunday morning I got to get one
[31:27] ready for Wednesday Wednesday night I
[31:28] can't sit still Hallelujah you're
[31:30] burdened to do it God's called you to do
[31:32] it and if God's called you God will
[31:34] equip you hallelujah amen
[31:37] amen and I'm doing my best who wants to
[31:40] do their best for the Lord hallelujah
[31:42] you do your best to feel the pressings
[31:45] of the Holy Spirit on your heart and
[31:46] your mind and receive dreams and visions
[31:49] and follow them you do your best and
[31:52] because you're trying to please the
[31:53] master
[31:56] Hallelujah and his message is lives on
[31:58] Immortal today because he spoke of
[32:00] Christ
[32:02] Jesus all right verse
[32:07] 16 and I baptized also the house of
[32:10] stefanus SO gas Christmas stefanus
[32:14] besides I know not whether I baptize any
[32:17] other so Paul was just thanking God
[32:19] thank God I didn't baptize a bunch of
[32:20] those
[32:23] pites church I've said it before I'm not
[32:25] a
[32:26] bromite I'm I'm a Jesus follower H I'm a
[32:29] Christian
[32:30] amen right I have no shame saying that
[32:33] just like brother Mar said I'm not a
[32:35] scoffield it he said he used a scoffield
[32:38] Bible but he's not a scoffield I like a
[32:41] worshipper of scoffield we're not
[32:43] worshippers of brother brandham but we
[32:44] know he's a prophet of God he point us
[32:46] to the word of God he foretold things in
[32:49] the name of the Lord that come to pass
[32:50] he's a Vindicated prophet of God
[32:53] hallelujah but we don't get into this
[32:55] thing where we worship the man like this
[32:58] church was worshiping men now church and
[33:00] think think about this uh in the midst
[33:02] of all this man worship they had all
[33:04] these gifts operating all the
[33:07] time so it proves gifts operate when
[33:10] people have them and when they're
[33:12] yielded to
[33:14] God and yet sin can be laying out in the
[33:17] church and leaven all over the place
[33:19] gifts can still operate because they're
[33:21] there and people are dedicated and
[33:23] invest in their
[33:25] gifts hallelujah amen every said I mean
[33:27] all this tongues all the prophecy uh
[33:31] interpretation Pro everything I'm going
[33:33] to show you another verse Paul's Paul
[33:35] said you have every gift Paul told him
[33:36] you have all the
[33:38] gifts it's not like they were lacking
[33:40] gifts God didn't shut down their gifts
[33:43] right did God shut down balam's gift no
[33:46] do we ever learn of God shutting down
[33:48] judas's gift no the gift doesn't get
[33:50] shut down but see in the midst of all
[33:53] that God was asking them you know
[33:55] they're operating that see they're
[33:56] partaking of two different right they're
[33:57] partaking of the spirit and then they're
[33:59] partaking of the
[34:00] flesh right sometimes uh bam would would
[34:03] go seek uh uh uh witchcraft right uh I
[34:06] forget the exact word the Bible said he
[34:08] would seek enchantments there it is he
[34:09] would seek enchantments other times he
[34:11] would seek
[34:12] Jehovah so these Corinthians would come
[34:14] together have all kinds of gifts every
[34:16] gift operate but then they'd be real
[34:18] carnal outside of church especially on
[34:20] communion
[34:22] Sunday they would set up all their meals
[34:24] and their tables and they wouldn't let
[34:26] the poor people come to the CH to come
[34:27] to the table and they'd be some of them
[34:30] would be getting drunk at the Lord's
[34:32] table a message
[34:36] Church
[34:38] Hallelujah for Christ sent me not to
[34:41] baptize isn't that something you would
[34:44] think every preacher was sent to
[34:46] baptize now Paul's just dealing with how
[34:48] they uh they were so worshiping men that
[34:51] uh their baptism was so important to
[34:53] their social status or their popularity
[34:55] as a Believer well I was baptized by
[34:57] Paul all I was baptized by
[35:00] Apollos I've been to Jeffersonville four
[35:02] times I think I've been four
[35:03] times I've been Jeffersonville 10 times
[35:06] you know they were trying to glory in
[35:09] themselves Paul said Christ did not send
[35:12] me necessarily to baptize in water but
[35:14] to preach the good news Hallelujah not
[35:18] with wisdom of words lest the Cross of
[35:21] Christ should be made of none effect
[35:24] he's talking about not Christ wisdom
[35:26] he's talking about worldly wisdom
[35:28] the worldly wisdom makes the cross
[35:31] uneffective
[35:32] see church I hope the cross could affect
[35:34] somebody today where the cross would
[35:37] give you power
[35:38] today if you're lacking power it's
[35:41] because you need to go to the Cross
[35:43] because that's what the Bible says the
[35:45] power of the Gospel is in the cross of
[35:47] Jesus
[35:48] Hallelujah like I told you when I've
[35:50] cast out Devils those six or seven times
[35:52] I always plead the blood I say the blood
[35:54] of Jesus Christ is against you and
[35:55] that's when they scream and that's when
[35:56] they fall the blood they they don't they
[35:59] don't like the blood because the blood
[36:01] has paid the price for our sins the
[36:04] blood pays the price which sets us free
[36:06] Hallelujah that's right right we're not
[36:08] under brother R said Satan has a legal
[36:10] right to stay there as long as the sin
[36:12] is unconfessed as long as there's leav
[36:14] in in the Life sin can stay there but as
[36:16] soon as that's confessed and trusting in
[36:18] the blood to forgive it that devil has
[36:20] to go
[36:22] Hallelujah right it has to go it's a
[36:24] legal issue Hallelujah that's right
[36:28] see those that need power you need the
[36:29] cross today that's what I need that's
[36:32] what you need Hallelujah that's what
[36:34] this chapter is about the power of the
[36:36] Cross
[36:37] hallelujah
[36:40] amen so it's man's Wisdom that makes the
[36:43] cross of none effect Jesus talked about
[36:46] it also in Matthew 15 I'm not going to
[36:48] go there but he said you teach
[36:50] Traditions the doctrines of
[36:52] men therefore the word of God has no
[36:55] effect so when people uh when preachers
[36:59] preach their own false Doctrine like
[37:01] their own idea or something it takes
[37:03] away from the power of the Cross if they
[37:06] just preach it plain and simple there's
[37:08] power God backs up the simple truth of
[37:11] the word of God hallelujah God backs it
[37:13] up
[37:14] amen I keep bringing that up I'm going
[37:16] to keep bringing it up you know just to
[37:17] see the Simplicity the summer of
[37:19] preaching against uh sexual immorality
[37:21] in pornography to see the power of God
[37:23] move in a place like
[37:26] that it again again shows us the power
[37:28] of the cross of Jesus Christ grown men
[37:31] crying grown men uh laying on their
[37:33] faces crying it's not all over their
[37:35] faces you saw it the power of the
[37:39] Cross Jesus can set you free you might
[37:42] be in Chains but Jesus Paid the price to
[37:44] break the chains Hallelujah that's the
[37:46] power of the Cross
[37:48] amen hallelujah it's that simple and if
[37:51] we could all get the same mind today if
[37:53] we could all think the same thing today
[37:55] that power is here hallelujah amen
[37:58] that's what Paul's talking
[38:00] about but see the false wisdom of manw
[38:04] makes the cross uneffective the cross
[38:08] doesn't mean
[38:10] anything for the preaching of the Cross
[38:12] is to them that perish
[38:15] foolish why does Paul keep preaching on
[38:18] the cross why can't he move on to
[38:20] something more outstanding I'm sorry
[38:22] there's nothing more outstanding than
[38:24] that there's no more nothing more
[38:26] outstanding than Jesus saying father
[38:28] forgive them they don't know what
[38:30] they're doing and it is finished
[38:32] hallelujah what could be more powerful
[38:34] than that Hallelujah that the sin
[38:36] question is settled
[38:39] hallelujah what could be more powerful
[38:41] than
[38:43] that butto us which are saved how many
[38:46] saved we got in here today it is the
[38:48] power of God the preaching of the Cross
[38:52] is
[38:53] power Hallelujah that's right Church it
[38:57] was to me Hallelujah it was to me the
[38:59] preaching of the Cross was power to me
[39:01] power to change your life for it is
[39:04] written I will destroy the wisdom of the
[39:07] wise doesn't he do it all these big
[39:08] philosophers that rise up don't they all
[39:09] go down to the Grave eventually he
[39:12] destroys all their
[39:14] ideas and will bring to nothing the
[39:17] understanding of The
[39:18] Prudent
[39:20] right where's all their deep
[39:22] understandings today they're not here
[39:26] where's the wise where's the describe
[39:28] where's the disputer of this world hath
[39:30] not God made foolish the wisdom of this
[39:33] world aren't they so foolish they're so
[39:36] foolish they got on these robes brother
[39:37] Austin they call themselves Supreme
[39:38] Court and they ask him uh what is a
[39:40] woman I don't know I'm not a
[39:44] biologist
[39:46] foolishness you're all dress in your
[39:48] robes and got your gavels and all this
[39:51] all this foolish wisdom of the world I
[39:53] don't know what a woman is how about you
[39:55] go look at your X and Y Chrome why don't
[39:57] you do
[39:58] that anybody knows that see God makes
[40:02] them look foolish because they despise
[40:06] the Simplicity of God's word the wisdom
[40:08] of God
[40:11] hallelujah like it's turned into now
[40:14] what what's it been turned into now it's
[40:15] U it's called mental health now instead
[40:17] of
[40:18] demons instead of addiction it's called
[40:20] mental health you a bunch of demons
[40:23] that's what they are I've got mental
[40:25] health problems no you let sin into your
[40:27] life devils are living in your mind Paul
[40:30] said neither give place to the devil
[40:32] hallelujah amen I'm not talking about if
[40:34] it's like a genetic thing or you're born
[40:36] you know because of maybe the vaccines
[40:38] or something that would change
[40:39] somebody's whole Spirit I'm not talking
[40:40] about that I'm talking about a uh these
[40:42] adults right that that were we'd say uh
[40:46] normal but afterwards now they got all
[40:47] these mental
[40:49] problems well they probably got so many
[40:51] mental problems because they're so idle
[40:52] in the old days you just work the work
[40:54] your tail off all the time right and
[40:55] they kind of spank you into submission
[40:57] in the old days that was right before my
[40:59] days hallelujah right that's my parents
[41:02] would tell me about that they got
[41:03] spanked a lot more than I did and I got
[41:04] spanked very little and now my children
[41:06] get spank very
[41:07] little but we have to do what we have to
[41:10] do by God's grace amen but look at the
[41:13] foolishness of the
[41:15] world verse 21 for after that in the
[41:18] wisdom of God the World by wisdom knew
[41:20] not God see their worldly wisdom takes
[41:22] them away from God it pleased God by the
[41:26] foolishness of preaching to save them
[41:28] that believe so God is pleased when we
[41:31] preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ and
[41:34] people come up here and get saved
[41:36] Hallelujah I remember that night you
[41:37] know nature and virtue come up here and
[41:39] got saved and
[41:41] uh Benny's girlfriend's daughter what
[41:44] was her name chette I don't know why
[41:46] that that Wednesday night I think I was
[41:47] preaching on Martin Luther or something
[41:49] brother Austin I don't know what it was
[41:50] I was I thought in my mind I thought
[41:51] well this is this is kind of like a
[41:52] review on the cross you know I didn't
[41:54] know how it was going to turn out I just
[41:56] you know the spirit got on me I just
[41:58] kept preaching the blood preaching the
[41:59] blood and I just threw the net out you
[42:01] know CU we had visitors who wants to be
[42:03] saved and the first one up here is a
[42:04] visiting girl crying her eyes out want
[42:06] to be saved it didn't look very
[42:09] astounding it wasn't I'd say the uh the
[42:11] wisest sermon I ever preached with a
[42:13] maybe the the most depths of Revelation
[42:15] I simply preach the cross hallelujah
[42:18] hallelujah and three people come up and
[42:20] weep in their way uh to Christ and get
[42:22] baptized Hallelujah and like brother R
[42:25] said about hady writes boys look at how
[42:27] they uh he said look at the Hatty R's
[42:29] boys they got saved look how they do
[42:31] communion and feet washing look how our
[42:32] sisters do feet feet washing and
[42:34] communion they're the ones delivering
[42:35] the tubs so we can wash our Dirty Feet
[42:39] hopefully they're kind of clean but look
[42:41] at that look at the effects of the
[42:42] Gospel just preaching the simple gospel
[42:44] and we didn't know I didn't know all the
[42:46] talks they were having at home you know
[42:47] our young sisters here by God's grace I
[42:49] didn't know all that all I know is this
[42:50] I got to preach what God presses on my
[42:52] heart thank God that he presses things
[42:54] on our hearts thank God for the
[42:55] inspiration of the Holy Spirit praise
[42:57] God amen amen what if that night I would
[43:00] have preach on the uh the depths of the
[43:02] Seven Seals and the Seven Thunders with
[43:04] the third pole would have had the same
[43:07] result probably not that have been good
[43:09] to learn right that it's all good to
[43:10] learn that but there's nothing as more
[43:13] powerful as the cross Hallelujah that's
[43:16] what the Bible says because the greatest
[43:19] Miracle of all is a soul that saved
[43:21] passes from Death unto life
[43:24] Hallelujah pleases God by the
[43:26] foolishness of up preaching to save them
[43:28] that would
[43:29] believe I believe Hallelujah I believe
[43:31] in the cross of Jesus
[43:33] Christ for the Jews require a sign and
[43:36] the Greeks seek wisdom so what what are
[43:39] you more likely to do are you more
[43:41] spiritually Jewish and you got to have a
[43:42] sign a miracle for everything or you
[43:45] have to have a preacher that's so
[43:46] perfect and every word he said takes in
[43:48] such deep uh thoughts and Revelation
[43:51] Paul's he's given a contrast here I'm
[43:53] trying to apply to our lives we're
[43:54] neither we're not Jews right but some
[43:56] people on both sides right like that's
[43:59] the what I call them the goat movement
[44:00] but I do believe they're saved and many
[44:02] of them I believe some of them are
[44:03] filled with the Holy Ghost they're just
[44:04] majoring on Miracles right now got to
[44:06] have a miracle got to have a sign every
[44:08] sermon and now church I'm not
[44:10] criticizing this but every sermon sounds
[44:11] like what's your Miracle at the end and
[44:13] God's going to bring home your wayward
[44:15] loved ones that's like almost every
[44:16] sermon ends with that well that's okay
[44:19] that's what they're seeking they're
[44:20] they're older you know some of them are
[44:21] older parents grandparents they want
[44:23] their loved ones their wayward children
[44:25] to come home now what am I end with a
[44:27] lot uh getting right with God living a
[44:29] Pure Life sanctification you know CU
[44:32] that's where we are our children thank
[44:34] God haven't gone Wayward and the church
[44:36] said amen
[44:39] hallelujah thank God that's a blessing
[44:41] we're a blessed Church Hallelujah God's
[44:43] protected us no one's in the hospital no
[44:45] one's got cancer no one's uh running our
[44:47] children aren't running around in the
[44:48] world thank God for the hedge of the
[44:50] Holy Spirit praise God it's good to
[44:52] remember what God has done for us
[44:55] hallelujah how he has protected us us
[44:58] give us three baptisms this year by
[45:00] God's
[45:01] grace Hallelujah young people in the
[45:04] prime of their life where they could if
[45:05] they ever wanted to be sinful this would
[45:07] be the time to do it brother said if you
[45:09] would have given me a choice of break up
[45:11] 100 years into quarters he said which
[45:13] one would you want to live he said if
[45:14] you want to be a muscle man or a
[45:15] beautiful woman you better choose that
[45:16] first quarter 0 to 25 you want to be a
[45:19] beautiful actress you better choose that
[45:20] one he said' if they would ask me he
[45:22] said I would taken that last one he said
[45:24] because I'd know more about it
[45:27] I'd know how to preach the gospel amen
[45:29] I'd have more wisdom amen i' have more
[45:32] understanding I wouldn't rely on the
[45:34] flesh I rely on the spirit
[45:37] Hallelujah that's what we need to rely
[45:39] on is the holy
[45:41] spirit so see Jews require got to have a
[45:44] sign got to have a
[45:45] sign the Greeks seek after wisdom needs
[45:48] to be more wise that was that was
[45:50] chopped up spitting all over the place
[45:53] confused said the wrong words they got
[45:55] to have wisdom
[45:58] but what do we preach we preach Christ
[46:01] crucified unto the Jews this stumbles
[46:04] them because it's not the sign they
[46:06] wanted Jesus said I'm going to give you
[46:07] a sign it's a sign of Jonas amen
[46:11] hallelujah but they didn't want that
[46:13] sign and to the Greeks oh it's foolish
[46:16] was wasting your time you know talking
[46:18] about a man who died 2,000 years ago now
[46:21] that that's what today people say people
[46:23] say you I've seen it online some of
[46:25] these uh Debaters over over the the
[46:27] years they say look how silly
[46:29] Christianity is you're trusting in a man
[46:31] that lived 2,000 years ago and you think
[46:34] that maybe he raised from the dead that
[46:35] that that because maybe he raised you
[46:37] expect to raise some someday when we've
[46:40] had 2,000 years is nobody raised from
[46:41] the dead he they said don't you see how
[46:43] foolish this is but yet that's the power
[46:46] that's the truth of God Amen Hallelujah
[46:49] Jesus did live a s a sinless life
[46:51] Hallelujah he was the Lamb of God he did
[46:54] raise from the dead Hallelujah and all
[46:56] those if that same spirit that was in
[46:58] Jesus is in you it shall Quicken your
[47:01] mortal body
[47:03] hallelujah it's the promise of God it
[47:06] cannot fail
[47:08] Hallelujah see see to look in 2,000
[47:10] years like no one's even raised up and
[47:13] no one's been resurrected for 2,000
[47:15] years and yet you believe that yes I
[47:17] believe that amen with all my soul H
[47:20] with all my heart amen because every
[47:22] seed of God must fall on the ground rot
[47:25] and then be Resurrected
[47:27] hallelujah praise God that's what Jesus
[47:29] said about himself amen I've got to be
[47:32] put into the ground and rot and then
[47:34] I'll bring forth much fruit and that's
[47:36] what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15 right
[47:38] there's two kinds of bodies one is sown
[47:41] in in I'm sorry one is swn in corruption
[47:43] it's raised and incorruption amen
[47:45] hallelujah
[47:47] Glory now verse 24 but unto them which
[47:49] are called both the Jews and the Greeks
[47:51] Christ the power of God and the wisdom
[47:53] of God so Jesus is both of ours Jesus is
[47:56] the power power Jesus has signs and
[47:58] Jesus has wisdom hallelujah it's just
[48:01] packaged different than what the world
[48:03] gives Hallelujah that's right Christ
[48:08] gives us the power of God the signs of
[48:10] God and Christ gives us the wisdom of
[48:13] God but remember the Bible said the
[48:15] ungodly they will go from more
[48:17] ungodliness to more ungodliness their
[48:19] sins are going to keep getting worse and
[48:21] worse Our Lives should get more holy and
[48:24] more holy in other words we're
[48:26] progressing on that Ark like I preached
[48:27] last Sunday we're pro progressing on
[48:29] that Ark into greater maturity and also
[48:31] greater Revelation and also a holy
[48:34] life that's the progression Hallelujah
[48:38] see that's why you know brother William
[48:39] and sister be over the years they see
[48:40] the preachers let down on the bars
[48:42] that's the that's the downward Arc we've
[48:45] got to keep the bar right we got to keep
[48:47] the bar raising Hallelujah we got to
[48:49] keep the goats out how' these goats get
[48:52] in here you put up the bars right we've
[48:53] got to keep the goats out we got to keep
[48:55] preaching the truth of God all God's
[48:57] elect will come to the truth hallelujah
[49:00] amen Jesus said all them that heard
[49:03] heard me will hear you praise God Amen
[49:05] that's the confidence I know brother Nia
[49:08] Hallelujah all them that heard Jesus
[49:10] will hear me because I'm preaching the
[49:12] same thing Jesus said that's right all
[49:15] the elect will come glory to
[49:17] God why church because the foolishness
[49:20] of God is wiser than men in other words
[49:24] the preaching of God is wiser than men
[49:27] and the weakness of God is stronger than
[49:29] men for you see your calling Brethren
[49:32] how that not many wise men after the
[49:34] flesh not many mighty not many noble are
[49:38] called now remember Justice and
[49:40] Christmas were two of those Mighty noble
[49:42] people right they were they were leaders
[49:44] in the synagogue these were mighty men
[49:46] under a lot of power Financial power
[49:49] spiritual influence and God didn't save
[49:51] all of them God just saved a couple of
[49:53] them sometimes God does save uh we'd say
[49:57] the the rich and and the famous or
[49:59] something like that you know this year
[50:00] we've seen numerous people uh come out
[50:02] and say they're Christians right or I
[50:05] know you they say they believe in God
[50:07] now now by their fruits they're known
[50:10] right but see they they you know it's a
[50:12] surprise to some you know some big names
[50:14] come out and really follow God to the
[50:17] best that they know how but we got to
[50:18] ask are they wise or
[50:21] foolish well all their Instagram posts
[50:23] Will Tell Us in about five minutes if
[50:25] they're wise or foolish what was that
[50:28] one guy's name Russell BR was that his
[50:29] name he would used to be so filthy but
[50:32] now he got baptized well he's he gets on
[50:34] his knees and prays to uh Mary and does
[50:36] all kinds of things I've seen him there
[50:38] with with Andrew Peterson and believes
[50:40] he can still drink and all these things
[50:42] now you know people uh you know you can
[50:45] tell right away is that wise or is that
[50:47] foolish because now there's two kinds of
[50:49] these saved now I I Hope they've
[50:52] experienced the power of the Cross but
[50:54] the power of the Cross was to separate
[50:56] you from from your sin to make you love
[50:58] righteousness to seek ye first the
[51:00] kingdom of God and his righteousness
[51:03] Hallelujah that's what the gospel came
[51:05] to
[51:05] do so there's not many mighty after the
[51:08] flesh there's not many noble that are
[51:11] called not many wise men Paul was one of
[51:14] them Paul was a mighty man right he was
[51:17] a Pharisee of the Pharisees I'll say
[51:19] like this he was the Catholic of the
[51:21] Catholic for our day right there was no
[51:24] Catholic like like like him right he was
[51:26] the most religious he was the most
[51:28] devoted to his Traditions so caught up
[51:31] in the in the denomination but yet God
[51:33] saved the Pharisee the
[51:36] Pharisee God had a purpose for it God
[51:39] has a purpose for you praise God Amen it
[51:41] also encourages keep praying for those
[51:43] people that are in high positions right
[51:47] maybe people that are great wise men or
[51:49] great uh powerful rich men keep praying
[51:52] for them because God Will Call some of
[51:54] them Hallelujah
[51:58] amen but God ha chosen the foolish
[52:00] things of the world to confound the wise
[52:03] and God has chosen the weak things of
[52:05] the world to confound the things that
[52:08] are Mighty Hallelujah I'll probably
[52:10] preach on that some more next time by
[52:11] God's grace now I want to get down to
[52:13] this here I'm coming up on 50 minutes
[52:19] here let's look at Paul's loving Spirit
[52:22] of Correction I was reading in 2
[52:23] Corinthians yesterday look what Paul
[52:24] said you know so I want you to
[52:26] understand this as we go on in the book
[52:28] of First Corinthians Paul said for out
[52:30] of much Affliction and anguish of heart
[52:32] I wrote unto you with many
[52:34] tears now Paul didn't say that in the
[52:37] letter if you read 1 Corinthians 11 1
[52:39] Corinthians the book he never says I'm
[52:41] crying while I'm writing this but he
[52:44] was he was crying about man you're
[52:46] arguing about the the greatest message
[52:48] preacher why you arguing about
[52:50] that right then he's going to say why
[52:52] you why you why you letting these people
[52:54] commit sexual immorality why you letting
[52:56] them get drunk this is the Lord's
[52:58] table this is
[53:01] Christ we don't see it in chap in this
[53:04] first letter but he was crying brother
[53:07] sister not that you should be grieved so
[53:09] he wasn't crying hoping they'd be
[53:10] grieved but that you might know the love
[53:13] which I have more abundantly unto
[53:16] you so he wrote the correction so that
[53:19] they would know Paul loved them
[53:22] Hallelujah and that uh that then in the
[53:25] second letter he would know he wrote it
[53:27] while he was crying Hallelujah let's
[53:30] read uh chapter 2 2 Corinthians 2
[53:35] 1-6 this was a blessing to me yesterday
[53:37] I didn't even realize that Paul was
[53:39] writing all these things with
[53:42] tears oh yeah and isn't that right
[53:44] remember uh in Ephesus he said he warned
[53:46] them day and night for three years in
[53:47] tears that's right amen
[53:50] hallelujah crying over their sins and
[53:52] crying crying over the fact he knows
[53:54] there's going to come people come in and
[53:56] divide the church he said they're wolves
[53:59] uh not sparing the flock and they're
[54:01] taking members after themselves for
[54:03] their own
[54:05] following and Paul would warn them for
[54:07] three years in tears wolves are coming
[54:10] in wolves are coming in but what he do
[54:14] it with he did it with the love of God
[54:19] hallelujah verse one but I determined
[54:22] this with myself that I would not come
[54:23] unto you in heaviness for if I make you
[54:26] sorry who is he then that maketh me glad
[54:28] but the same which is made Sorry by me
[54:32] and I wrote this same unto you lest when
[54:34] I came I should have sorrow from them of
[54:37] whom I ought to Rejoice so Paul should
[54:39] have been happy but he was sad because
[54:41] they weren't living the right way having
[54:43] confidence in you all that my joy is the
[54:46] joy of you all now here's the one we
[54:49] read for out of much Affliction of
[54:50] Anguish of heart I wrote unto you with
[54:52] many tears not that ye should be grieved
[54:54] but that you might know the love which I
[54:56] have more abundantly unto you but if any
[54:58] have caused grief he hath not grieve me
[55:01] but in part that I may not overcharge
[55:04] you
[55:05] all Hallelujah so it wasn't everybody of
[55:08] course in the church that was off the
[55:09] word but numerous people were off the
[55:11] word of God right and he had to address
[55:14] it he said the love of God constrained
[55:17] him to do that verse
[55:20] seven so that con I'm sorry verse six
[55:22] sufficient to such a man is the
[55:24] punishment which was inflicted of
[55:27] many and I also want to read seven too
[55:29] so that contrarywise he ought rather to
[55:31] forgive him and comfort him lest perhaps
[55:34] such a one should be swallowed up with
[55:36] over much sorrow so there are some
[55:38] people when they repent they'll let the
[55:41] enemy put too much condemnation on them
[55:43] and then they're so sad see you know
[55:46] that's why it's important to have the
[55:47] joy of the Lord amen
[55:49] hallelujah see the reason sometimes
[55:51] people are so sad in church is because
[55:53] of this they make a mistake and they let
[55:55] Satan beat them up about it amen and
[55:58] they can't they can't remember that
[56:00] Jesus forgave it all and he takes you
[56:02] out of darkness and he helps you to walk
[56:04] in the light as Christ is in the light
[56:07] Hallelujah see we can't we can't dwell
[56:09] in our past because the devil's going to
[56:11] try to put that uh condemnation on us he
[56:14] calls it over much
[56:16] sorrow make you so sad about your
[56:19] past remember the Bible said Jesus comes
[56:21] to give us a hope for the future he even
[56:23] said that in the Old Testament he said I
[56:25] know I know what plans I have for you
[56:28] hope for a future Hallelujah plans of
[56:30] good not evil amen hallelujah but Satan
[56:33] loves to do this uh when he writes you
[56:35] know Paul wrote the letter of Correction
[56:37] uh the people got corrected they said
[56:38] they were sorry but Satan put too much
[56:41] uh punishment and condemnation on them
[56:43] and they let Satan do it right we all
[56:46] that Satan beat us up sometimes but we
[56:49] don't have to stay there because there's
[56:51] power in the cross amen hallelujah
[56:53] Remember The Old Rugged Cross amen
[56:55] hallelujah
[56:57] remember what it did praise God it
[56:59] forgave all your trespasses all your
[57:01] iniquities Hallelujah separate your sins
[57:04] as far as the East is from the West I
[57:06] don't remember your sins anymore
[57:07] Hallelujah so why do you remember your
[57:09] sins Hallelujah he said I'll remember
[57:12] them no
[57:13] more and yet the devil gets this guy
[57:16] here to over much sorrow about his sins
[57:20] he just can't forget all of his mistakes
[57:22] and
[57:23] sins thank God there's joy in the house
[57:25] of the Lord
[57:27] amen hallelujah even when God has to
[57:29] correct us we can still be joyful
[57:31] because he loves us he corrects all his
[57:33] children that he loves as many as I love
[57:36] I rebuke and Chas and Jesus says that's
[57:39] right
[57:40] Church
[57:43] Hallelujah now let's move on here now
[57:46] I'm going to chapter
[57:50] 7 just look here again he he wrote this
[57:53] letter because we're going to get into
[57:54] all these think of all these I I kind of
[57:57] rehearsed them on Wednesday think of all
[57:59] the sins that the Corinthians were
[58:00] guilty of yet they had the gifts
[58:02] everywhere they any any aisle you turn
[58:05] to there's a gift oh there's a gift of
[58:06] healing right there oh there's a gift of
[58:08] Prophecy right there there's a gift of
[58:10] Miracles there's a gift of faith right
[58:11] there every aisle had gifts up and down
[58:13] the
[58:14] aisles but they also had leaven in the
[58:17] aisles right nobody could deny those
[58:20] gifts are operating but there was 11
[58:22] that need to be taken care of the love
[58:24] of God brought it to light and the love
[58:26] of God tried to purge it
[58:29] out then Satan come along and make the
[58:31] people feel really bad rather than just
[58:34] saying you're sorry moving on and
[58:36] getting
[58:37] Victory verse eight for though I made
[58:39] you sorry with the letter I do not
[58:41] repent so though I did repent for I
[58:44] perceive that the same epistle hath made
[58:45] you sorry though it were but for a
[58:47] season so see you just you're you're
[58:49] repenting for a little season and then
[58:50] you got the victory again now Rejoice
[58:53] not that you were made sorry but that
[58:55] you sorrowed to repentance so Paul
[58:57] rejoiced they actually were sad to
[58:59] repent their sadness caused them to
[59:02] change their
[59:03] life for you were made sorry after a
[59:06] Godly manner that you might receive
[59:07] damage by us in nothing so see when
[59:10] someone brings the love of God in
[59:11] correction it doesn't damage them it
[59:13] just helps them correction is not damage
[59:15] it's helpful if it's received with the
[59:18] right Spirit right that's what Paul says
[59:20] for Godly sorrow worketh repentance to
[59:23] Salvation not to be repented of
[59:27] Hallelujah but the sorrow of the world
[59:29] worketh death right with Judas he was
[59:32] sorry that he got caught we went we know
[59:34] that last week or was the week before
[59:35] they're just sorry they got caught like
[59:37] those Samaritans we looked at you the
[59:38] partial fear of the Lord on communion
[59:40] night they're just sorry they got caught
[59:42] they really they really want to keep
[59:44] going their
[59:45] sin may God may God give us Godly sorrow
[59:49] that we really want to repent that we
[59:51] really want we really want to change and
[59:54] it it it I think it it bears repeating
[59:56] there's three parts to repentance right
[59:57] you got to hate your sin change your
[59:59] thinking and make amends for it if you
[1:00:02] haven't done those three things to your
[1:00:04] sin it's going to stay with
[1:00:05] you right it's going to stay as leaven
[1:00:08] but you got to hate it you got to change
[1:00:10] your mind about it right not choose to
[1:00:13] worship it like that man who would who
[1:00:14] tried to kill brother Bram he worshiped
[1:00:16] that Spirit there therefore he couldn't
[1:00:17] get delivered from it right and then uh
[1:00:21] the last one I can't remember the last
[1:00:22] one make amends thank you yep I just
[1:00:25] coming to me make amen thank you Dy
[1:00:28] Hallelujah for behold this selfs same
[1:00:31] thing that ye sorrowed after a Godly
[1:00:32] sort what carefulness have WR in you so
[1:00:35] see church when we really repent we're
[1:00:36] careful how we're living after we leave
[1:00:38] church so often church we forget what we
[1:00:41] heard in church right or we forget what
[1:00:43] we listen to in our car I'm talking
[1:00:44] about we forget what we read in our
[1:00:45] Bible the day the morning of that same
[1:00:47] day God help us to remember praise God
[1:00:51] but see this is what real repentance
[1:00:52] does it makes you careful not to go into
[1:00:54] that sin again oh I've seen that trick
[1:00:57] before I've seen that trap before I'm
[1:00:59] not going that direction makes you
[1:01:02] careful it rought in you yay what
[1:01:04] clearing of yourself so see you cleared
[1:01:05] yourself from that I'm no longer
[1:01:06] associated with that I have moved on
[1:01:09] from my anger brother man always uses
[1:01:11] temper I moved on from my temper he must
[1:01:13] have a lot of tempers there in
[1:01:14] Jeffersonville Indiana he always talks
[1:01:16] about
[1:01:17] temper he said Temper Temper to fight a
[1:01:19] buzz saww that's a pretty good temper
[1:01:22] not good in a good way but good in a bad
[1:01:24] way pretty powerful
[1:01:26] he said you cleared yourself what
[1:01:28] ignation What Fear yay what vem desire
[1:01:31] what Zeal what Revenge that's why I
[1:01:33] preach that when Emma was here you know
[1:01:34] I preached that message on you can have
[1:01:35] revenge on Satan take revenge on him in
[1:01:39] other words when he comes around knock
[1:01:40] him out by God's grace put him under
[1:01:42] your feet praise God that's what we just
[1:01:44] Sayang that and the Bible says that in
[1:01:45] the Book of Romans he said I know
[1:01:47] shortly you'll put Satan under your feet
[1:01:49] Hallelujah so you take that Serpent and
[1:01:51] you put him under your feet no offense
[1:01:53] to Malachi who likes his snakes put that
[1:01:56] serpent under your
[1:01:59] foot take revenge right be careful how
[1:02:03] you live that's real repentance in all
[1:02:07] things you have to prove yourselves to
[1:02:08] be clear in this
[1:02:10] matter wherefore though I wrote unto you
[1:02:13] I did I did it not for this cause that
[1:02:15] had done the wrong nor for his cause
[1:02:17] that suffered wrong but for our care for
[1:02:20] you in the sight of God might appear
[1:02:23] unto you so why did Paul write this
[1:02:26] letter to show them God's care God
[1:02:28] doesn't want them to continue being
[1:02:31] divided God doesn't want the people to
[1:02:33] continue to commit sexual
[1:02:35] sin right God doesn't God didn't want
[1:02:38] the people to be continually sorrowful
[1:02:40] for their sin and never get the victory
[1:02:42] over
[1:02:43] it
[1:02:45] right God didn't want them to get drunk
[1:02:47] at the Lord's table God didn't want them
[1:02:49] to despise the poor God wanted them in
[1:02:52] one mind in one Accord
[1:02:57] Hallelujah so see when God brings
[1:02:59] correction it's God's care for us God
[1:03:02] cares about us because he doesn't want
[1:03:04] us to have a leav amongst the body of
[1:03:07] Christ now here Paul had a lot to
[1:03:10] correct now these are just the first six
[1:03:11] I could find church talk about church
[1:03:14] order and
[1:03:16] problems first you got people divide
[1:03:18] over who the best preacher
[1:03:21] is I'm from that message Camp I'm from
[1:03:23] that message camp they're a better
[1:03:24] preacher than everybody he's the best
[1:03:26] preacher no he's the best preacher now
[1:03:28] today it's like she's the best preacher
[1:03:29] bunch of nonsense right now that's not
[1:03:32] the
[1:03:33] message then you had not only you had
[1:03:35] division amongst the people of of uh
[1:03:38] their favorite preachers or preacher
[1:03:40] worship you got preacher worship now you
[1:03:42] got sexual immorality in the church too
[1:03:45] got to clean that up remember Paul's
[1:03:47] writing this with tears how can these
[1:03:49] people sleep around how can they be so
[1:03:51] carnal he calls them babes we're going
[1:03:54] to get to that he calls them a bunch of
[1:03:55] baby
[1:03:57] Christians he's crying how this is what
[1:03:59] babies argue about this is what babies
[1:04:02] fuss about this ain't what a real mature
[1:04:04] Christian fuss is about
[1:04:07] right they were suing each other oh
[1:04:11] brother Austin brother William I'm gonna
[1:04:12] take you to
[1:04:14] Corn I'm gonna get my handshake
[1:04:17] back I don't know what else I give
[1:04:20] you imagine coming to church and look
[1:04:23] over somebody I'm going to take I'll see
[1:04:25] you in court on Mond Monday I'll see you
[1:04:27] tomorrow yeah God bless you I'll see you
[1:04:30] tomorrow in the courtroom this is what
[1:04:33] Paul had to write about what a church
[1:04:36] and we saw we all saw how it started a
[1:04:38] vision started this right we say oh the
[1:04:40] gifts were moving here and look what see
[1:04:42] we got to have a balance with gifts you
[1:04:45] got to have the character of Christ
[1:04:47] along with your
[1:04:48] gifts
[1:04:50] hallelujah what good is a gift if I'm
[1:04:52] going to sue you
[1:04:54] tomorrow what good good is a gift if the
[1:04:56] woman's going to chase another uh
[1:04:58] woman's husband or vice versa a man
[1:05:00] chase another man's wife what good is
[1:05:03] the gift at that
[1:05:04] point what did all those gifts do for
[1:05:07] you and Paul's crying how can this
[1:05:09] happen God have mercy where is the unity
[1:05:13] he says later there's only one Spirit
[1:05:16] there's one Lord One Faith one baptism
[1:05:19] there's different diversity there
[1:05:20] operations but it's one
[1:05:23] Spirit there were people G getting drunk
[1:05:26] at the Lord's
[1:05:28] Supper
[1:05:31] drunk and there was Pride about
[1:05:33] financial superiority well I'm richer
[1:05:35] than you no you you can't join us at
[1:05:37] this table in the fellowship H you can't
[1:05:39] join us because this is the the the the
[1:05:40] group that makes over
[1:05:43] 40K or this is the table that makes 60k
[1:05:46] 70k you keep going up the
[1:05:54] ks this is what what they found in the
[1:05:57] church that had all the gifts
[1:05:59] operating all the
[1:06:02] gifts also their order with spiritual
[1:06:05] gifts too many gifts operating too many
[1:06:09] gifts Paul has to set a limit on it
[1:06:12] because it was bringing
[1:06:13] confusion right he said we need some
[1:06:15] order to this the gifts have to come
[1:06:18] with order so we're we're we're we're
[1:06:21] men in understanding we want to
[1:06:24] understand what's going on so imagine
[1:06:25] they would have they'd have people
[1:06:26] speaking in tongues all over the church
[1:06:29] there was just chaos they have they had
[1:06:31] interpretations maybe while the preacher
[1:06:32] preaching like kind like brother went
[1:06:33] through right he would tell them okay
[1:06:35] sit down it's not time for your your
[1:06:36] tongue interpretation we don't have that
[1:06:38] one on tape but that would have been
[1:06:39] something special to have on tape God's
[1:06:41] got on tape but see that's too too much
[1:06:44] it was causing
[1:06:46] confusion and so Paul said you got to
[1:06:48] set this in order and then they even
[1:06:50] lack generosity they're in the one of
[1:06:52] the biggest cities it it was the Roman
[1:06:54] capital of Roman Greece it was said so
[1:06:58] Greece you know that big country Greece
[1:06:59] the capital of the Roman Empire in there
[1:07:02] was Corinth now of course the capital of
[1:07:04] Rome I'm sorry of Italy was Rome right I
[1:07:07] think they moved it to constan ople
[1:07:08] later
[1:07:10] on but in other words on that on that
[1:07:13] part of the the land that was the main
[1:07:16] influence of Rome was in Corinth and
[1:07:18] Paul said they lack generosity look no
[1:07:21] wonder he wrote you can move mountains
[1:07:23] but you don't have charity you're
[1:07:24] nothing
[1:07:26] you can move a mountain with your faith
[1:07:28] you can speak this into that speak that
[1:07:30] into existence but if you don't have
[1:07:31] love it didn't profit you anything
[1:07:36] Hallelujah
[1:07:37] Glory now here's the scripture they
[1:07:40] lacked no gift but they did lack
[1:07:45] love this is in chapter 1 verse 7 so
[1:07:48] that ye come together behind in no gift
[1:07:52] they weren't lacking in the operations
[1:07:53] of gifts
[1:07:56] they were lacking in
[1:07:58] love and a pure
[1:08:01] heart a pure life before
[1:08:04] Jesus
[1:08:06] amen can everybody see that by God's
[1:08:10] grace brother Ram said he couldn't or
[1:08:12] Paul couldn't teach them the Deep things
[1:08:14] of
[1:08:15] God he said he had to deal with all
[1:08:18] these light issues like this right all
[1:08:21] these sin
[1:08:22] issues like I said on Wednesday I'm
[1:08:24] going to bring this in um Wednesday I
[1:08:27] went through you know the the things
[1:08:28] we've struggled with as a
[1:08:31] church division that's probably if if if
[1:08:34] that could be the critical spirit or
[1:08:36] Pride I think that would be the one that
[1:08:37] we would battle the most over our 18
[1:08:39] years as a church not so much no one's
[1:08:41] ever sued me thank god um I've never
[1:08:44] seen anybody
[1:08:45] drunk I've never seen Financial
[1:08:48] superiority too many gifts never seen
[1:08:51] that we want more gifts right we we
[1:08:53] believe uh lacking generosity I don't
[1:08:55] think I've seen that I was going through
[1:08:58] some of my emails just this morning you
[1:08:59] know from six seven eight years ago and
[1:09:02] the critical spirit was criticizing how
[1:09:05] I was preaching it was uh the critical
[1:09:07] spirit was calling me Prejudice and the
[1:09:10] critical spirit was telling me uh
[1:09:12] wanting to know how much tithe I
[1:09:14] received and then was trying to tell me
[1:09:15] what to preach a woman was trying to
[1:09:18] tell me what to preach I'm sorry a man
[1:09:21] tells me what to preach his name is
[1:09:23] Jesus hallelujah praise
[1:09:26] God that's right
[1:09:28] Hallelujah now just looking at you know
[1:09:30] some of the nature of these was
[1:09:32] criticized for canceling a service in
[1:09:33] the snow criticize for
[1:09:36] that criticized for uh every little
[1:09:39] thing that I could possibly
[1:09:42] do uh yeah they said I was criticized uh
[1:09:45] for preaching against the rich I was
[1:09:48] criticized I said the it said I was
[1:09:50] Prejudice for for the poor I had too
[1:09:53] much compassion on the poor well I'll
[1:09:55] take that if that's the only cons that's
[1:09:57] the only critical thing you can come
[1:09:58] against with me I'll take that by God's
[1:10:00] grace
[1:10:04] hallelujah it's you know it's
[1:10:05] interesting you know like like I said we
[1:10:07] want to come to church and we want to
[1:10:08] see where does our church fit in the
[1:10:11] Bible where does my life where do I find
[1:10:14] myself in the word of God isn't it
[1:10:16] interesting church and like I said I
[1:10:18] told you I'm so thankful no one was
[1:10:20] drunk here at the Lord's table lesson I
[1:10:22] am so thankful if we're going to battle
[1:10:24] one of these I'm thankful than F it's
[1:10:26] that
[1:10:29] Hallelujah that's why I like to keep
[1:10:31] receipts I like to keep texts and emails
[1:10:33] and all kinds of things notes on
[1:10:35] meetings to remember right so I can
[1:10:38] remember what are we fighting but what
[1:10:41] what uh uh how can we overcome by the
[1:10:43] grace of God hallelujah like brother man
[1:10:45] says it doesn't matter what you're
[1:10:46] fighting it just matters that you have
[1:10:47] the word of God to overcome that
[1:10:49] Hallelujah so we got to see ourselves I
[1:10:52] want to see myself in the word of God I
[1:10:54] want to see
[1:10:55] where do we fit of course we have room
[1:10:57] to grow I've told you that before
[1:10:59] brother manam said I think love is the
[1:11:01] greatest Force there is in the
[1:11:06] world if someone said uh come to you
[1:11:08] today and said after service what you
[1:11:11] know God led me to tell you you speak
[1:11:13] the greatest Force what force do you
[1:11:15] want in the church I'd say you might say
[1:11:17] prophecy you might say all nine gifts
[1:11:20] operating right you know rapturing Faith
[1:11:23] what would you say what's the greatest
[1:11:25] course we could have brother they'd say
[1:11:26] oh rapturing Faith the spoken word
[1:11:30] brother understand all the Mysteries we
[1:11:32] already do I got we do if it's a Bible
[1:11:35] defined mystery brother M taught us but
[1:11:38] brother said the greatest force in all
[1:11:40] the universe is love there's nothing
[1:11:44] more powerful than love and what did
[1:11:46] Paul write that correction with
[1:11:49] love correction comes by
[1:11:52] love if I had the choice tonight and I
[1:11:55] was a sinner and was standing here
[1:11:57] before God and he have said now
[1:12:01] boy now boy I'm going to give you all
[1:12:03] the nine spiritual gifts I'm going to
[1:12:05] let you prophesy and give you the spirit
[1:12:06] of Prophecy right oh tell me who's going
[1:12:08] to win the election or or what what year
[1:12:10] is the
[1:12:11] rapture prophesy for me give me the I
[1:12:14] want to know the prophecies I'm going to
[1:12:16] make you a mighty preacher give you the
[1:12:17] word of wisdom and understanding I'm

[1:12:21] tongues interpret I'm going to give you
[1:12:22] a gift of healing that you'll have the
[1:12:24] great faith for the sick
[1:12:25] and I'm going to do all these things for
[1:12:27] you I'll give you all that or I won't
[1:12:29] let you have any of those but let you
[1:12:31] have the Real Love in Your
[1:12:34] Heart I'd say God give me
[1:12:38] love that's right pretty good sermon
[1:12:41] title right there is
[1:12:43] it for where there what does he quote
[1:12:45] Paul for where there's tongues they
[1:12:47] shall cease where there's prophecy it
[1:12:50] will fail where there's knowledge it
[1:12:53] it'll vanish but where there's love it
[1:12:56] will endure
[1:12:57] forever that's what drove the heart of
[1:13:00] God to send Christ to the Earth the love
[1:13:02] of God for 4,000 years God endured the
[1:13:04] wickedness of man and but then the Bible
[1:13:07] said for God so loved the world
[1:13:09] Hallelujah that he gave his only
[1:13:11] begotten son butam said take all of
[1:13:15] everything else but give me love if I
[1:13:18] had every gift in the Bible could
[1:13:20] exchange it for love I'd never wink an
[1:13:22] eye uh uh do I want to prophesy do I
[1:13:24] want tongues I want Miracle do I or that
[1:13:26] or love he wouldn't even blink an eye oh
[1:13:28] love for
[1:13:30] sure I take it right now let me feel the
[1:13:33] blessings of the Lord Jesus and his
[1:13:35] Divine love into my heart that's shed
[1:13:37] abroad by the Holy Ghost and I'll
[1:13:38] exchange it any gift in the Bible for
[1:13:40] that yes sir I'd exchange a domain if I
[1:13:44] was a king and sitting on a throne and
[1:13:47] the world was my domain I'd give every
[1:13:49] penny of it and forfeit a million years
[1:13:51] of this life in this world here as to
[1:13:54] have the love of Jesus Christ that's
[1:13:56] shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy
[1:13:58] Ghost there's nothing to compare with it
[1:14:01] that's a quote amen I probably put that
[1:14:03] on on YouTube tomorrow
[1:14:07] Glory now as I mentioned on uh I'm gonna
[1:14:10] close here pretty soon I'm already over
[1:14:11] an hour yeah I've lost my track of my
[1:14:13] time I stopped my
[1:14:15] time if our if our uh battles with
[1:14:18] critical Spirits or division well then
[1:14:20] Paul addressed that it's a warning
[1:14:21] against carnality he said neither be
[1:14:23] idolators as we some of them as is
[1:14:26] written the people sat down to eat and
[1:14:28] Rose up eat and drink and Rose up the
[1:14:30] play that was when they built the idols
[1:14:32] right they were dancing all kinds of
[1:14:33] worldly dances let us not I'm sorry let
[1:14:36] us I'm sorry neither let us commit
[1:14:39] fornication as some of them committed
[1:14:41] and fell in one day 3 and
[1:14:43] 20,000 neither let us tempt Christ as
[1:14:45] some of them also tempted and were
[1:14:47] destroyed by the serpents neither murmur
[1:14:50] ye as some of them also
[1:14:52] murmured and were destroyed of the dest
[1:14:55] Destroyer okay so what is murmuring what
[1:14:57] does this critical spirit lead to God
[1:15:00] destroys them right now all these things
[1:15:04] happen unto them for amples and they are
[1:15:07] written for our admonition upon whom the
[1:15:09] ends of the world are come so all these
[1:15:11] are for us let's not be idolators let's
[1:15:14] keep our bodies pure from sexual sin
[1:15:16] let's not tempt Christ let's not
[1:15:17] complain and murmur right now all these
[1:15:20] things for for our benefit amen the love
[1:15:23] of God caused Paul to write this to us
[1:15:25] hallelujah
[1:15:28] amen wherefore let him that thinketh he
[1:15:30] stand take heed lest he fall in other
[1:15:33] words we should take warnings when we
[1:15:34] hear the word of God we should take
[1:15:36] warnings from the word of God because if
[1:15:38] we're not careful we're going to
[1:15:40] fall
[1:15:42] Hallelujah there no temptation taken you
[1:15:44] but such as common to man but God is
[1:15:46] faithful amen who will not suffer you to
[1:15:49] be tempted above that you are able but
[1:15:51] will with the Temptation also make a way
[1:15:53] to escape it that ye may be able to Bear
[1:15:55] it doesn't love bear all things he's
[1:15:58] going to get to that a little bit right
[1:15:59] in two chapters see you can bear it
[1:16:02] because love can bear it God's love in
[1:16:04] you will bear it it's not your faith
[1:16:07] it's jesus' Faith it's not your love
[1:16:09] it's the love of Christ amen we have no
[1:16:11] ability of ourselves to do it wherefore
[1:16:14] my dearly beloved flee from idolatry I'm
[1:16:16] trying to close Okay so I told you I'm
[1:16:18] going to go back to the beginning of the
[1:16:20] chapter Paul could write this you know
[1:16:22] why because he knew there was bride
[1:16:24] members in that group
[1:16:25] group not all were
[1:16:27] bride not all maybe were saved not all
[1:16:30] were foolish virgin but he knew there
[1:16:32] was some bride members in there because
[1:16:33] Jesus said you've got some in there
[1:16:35] Hallelujah GE if Jesus said it surely
[1:16:37] there are some Believers in there what
[1:16:39] do he even tell him in the second letter
[1:16:41] I espoused you to one husband I engaged
[1:16:45] you to Christ that I may present you as
[1:16:48] a chased virgin to Christ now nobody
[1:16:50] engaged me to my wife I engaged myself
[1:16:52] under her right but that's not the
[1:16:54] spiritual way in the spiritual way a
[1:16:56] prophet or a man of God engages you to
[1:17:00] Christ that's what the Bible says when
[1:17:02] the when a preacher preaches the gospel
[1:17:03] to you and you accept Jesus Christ that
[1:17:06] preacher engaged you uh Jesse will you
[1:17:08] be engaged to the Lord Jesus yes I
[1:17:11] will right that's what Paul says and
[1:17:15] Paul said I engage you so I can present
[1:17:17] you as a pure virgin to Christ so see
[1:17:21] Paul knew some of them in their that
[1:17:23] church with all those six problems and
[1:17:25] all these all this sin going around all
[1:17:26] the Le going around there's some real
[1:17:28] seed in there by God's grace Hallelujah
[1:17:31] and the true seed of God will accept
[1:17:32] correction because it's a love of God
[1:17:34] bring it to them because they want to be
[1:17:36] a chased versin to Christ Hallelujah
[1:17:39] that's right
[1:17:40] church now each of now since each of
[1:17:43] these messages directed to the angel the
[1:17:45] human messenger a very great
[1:17:46] responsibility as well as wonderful
[1:17:48] privilege is his lot to these men God
[1:17:51] makes a special I'm sorry makes special
[1:17:53] promises as in the case of the the 12
[1:17:55] apostles sitting on 12 Thrones judging
[1:17:57] the 12 tribes of Israel then remember
[1:17:59] Paul was given a special promise that of
[1:18:02] presenting the people of the Bride in
[1:18:05] his day to Jesus so the church age
[1:18:08] messenger gets a special blessing a
[1:18:11] special privilege they get to introduce
[1:18:14] the bride to
[1:18:16] Jesus Lord Jesus you sent me to preach
[1:18:19] in Corinth you gave me a dream and
[1:18:21] vision you protected me I didn't fear I
[1:18:23] wasn't afraid because you gave me the
[1:18:24] dream and vision now Lord here's your
[1:18:26] bride here's your chased virgin to you
[1:18:28] here's your chased virgin here's your
[1:18:30] wife and everybody will stand all the
[1:18:32] other ages will stand and clap
[1:18:34] hallelujah praise God the church at
[1:18:36] Corinth made it through praise God they
[1:18:38] overcame their drunkenness and their
[1:18:40] sexual immorality they overcame their
[1:18:42] pride and their divisions they overcame
[1:18:43] their uh their class Warfare they
[1:18:46] overcame all that by the blood of the
[1:18:48] Lamb hallelujah amen and the word of
[1:18:50] their testimony praise God Paul knew
[1:18:53] there was some in there who really
[1:18:54] believed
[1:18:58] it so it will be with every messenger
[1:19:01] who has been faithful to the word of his
[1:19:03] hour and his age it will be so in the
[1:19:07] last day it will be the same special
[1:19:10] reward that was given to Paul and then
[1:19:12] brother R tells a story of going beyond
[1:19:13] the curtain of time church if we pass on
[1:19:17] before the
[1:19:18] Rapture if brother braham's dream is
[1:19:21] right we're going to be running to
[1:19:22] brother Braham saying my precious
[1:19:24] brother my precious
[1:19:26] brother you engage me to
[1:19:29] Christ right brother said when he left
[1:19:32] after the vision everything at when he
[1:19:34] was leaving people were still running to
[1:19:36] say brother Brandon brother Brandon
[1:19:37] brother Brandon Hallelujah why because
[1:19:39] he preached the gospel hallelujah amen
[1:19:42] he was engaging them to Christ in other
[1:19:44] words they didn't know Christ the way
[1:19:46] they knew it uh except through the
[1:19:47] ministry that God gave to the prophet of
[1:19:49] God the church age messenger Hallelujah
[1:19:52] because he was in the hand of Christ
[1:19:55] that was Christ's star that was Christ's
[1:19:57] light given to us and I know brother
[1:20:00] William can say amen I know beatric and
[1:20:01] my wife those of us who are in
[1:20:03] denomination we can say Amen when we
[1:20:04] were in the church the denomination it

[1:20:14] have it too Hallelujah you don't have to
[1:20:17] go out in the world you can have it uh

[1:20:26] Hallelujah see there's a special truth
[1:20:29] in
[1:20:29] here that although there's sin around
[1:20:32] although there's uh all this division
[1:20:34] all these things all sexual sin although
[1:20:36] that's there there's some real seed in
[1:20:37] there God knows who's who are his

[1:20:44] God knoweth them that are his
[1:20:46] Hallelujah and let him that nameth the
[1:20:48] name of Christ depart from all iniquity
[1:20:51] yeah there it is amen thank you Lord
[1:20:53] amen
[1:20:55] I'm closing with this I am going to
[1:20:57] close going back to the beginning Paul
[1:20:59] called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ
[1:21:01] to the of go now I look at it like this
[1:21:02] I'm called to be the pastor I was called
[1:21:05] by Jesus Christ I didn't go looking for
[1:21:06] this place I didn't I didn't jockey for
[1:21:09] position I didn't debate with people to
[1:21:11] get it God called me to do
[1:21:12] it through the will of God under the
[1:21:16] Church of God which is in Corinth and
[1:21:18] them that are Sanctified look there so
[1:21:20] see there was a lot of sin but thank God
[1:21:23] brother Patrick there were some sanctify
[1:21:25] people in the church he's writing to
[1:21:27] them that are Sanctified they're set
[1:21:29] apart from the world all those drunken
[1:21:32] Corinthians right all that sexual
[1:21:35] immorality history says there were so
[1:21:36] many prostitutes there that male and
[1:21:38] female anyone could have a prostitute
[1:21:40] any night they wanted because that was
[1:21:42] the Hub of the Roman Empire there in
[1:21:45] Corinth right it was so awful but Paul
[1:21:48] says that you have been saved by Christ
[1:21:51] and you are Sanctified away from the
[1:21:53] world you're called to be
[1:21:56] Saints can everybody say this can
[1:21:57] everybody say I am already a saint ready
[1:21:59] I am already a saint it's not the
[1:22:01] Catholic Church you don't have to die
[1:22:02] and have people get testimonies off you
[1:22:04] to be a saint you already are a saint
[1:22:06] amen you already are called to be a
[1:22:08] saint Hallelujah when I gather my
[1:22:10] children for Bible time I say come on
[1:22:12] Saints let's have Bible time and some of
[1:22:14] them like Zion he's not he's not
[1:22:15] baptized yet but he's a saint Hallelujah
[1:22:18] he's going to be by God's grace if we
[1:22:20] trust the Lord amen we are already
[1:22:22] Saints we're already sanctified
[1:22:25] with all that in every place call upon
[1:22:27] the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord both
[1:22:30] theirs and ours Hallelujah see that's
[1:22:33] the thing to do church we got to call
[1:22:35] upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:22:38] call him like call the name call the
[1:22:41] name
[1:22:42] Jehovah call upon him right both them
[1:22:45] the cor Corinthians and us we got to
[1:22:48] call upon the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:22:50] Christ Grace be unto you I always like
[1:22:53] uh how every time Paul say says grace
[1:22:55] before peace why because you can't have
[1:22:56] peace unless you got Grace I can't have
[1:22:59] any peace in my heart until I know God
[1:23:01] gives me favor that I don't
[1:23:04] deserve and now because I've received
[1:23:06] Grace now I can have peace he never says
[1:23:08] peace then Grace he always says Grace
[1:23:10] and
[1:23:11] peace from God our Father and from the
[1:23:14] Lord Jesus Christ so that means you get
[1:23:16] it from the invisible Spirit father you
[1:23:17] also get it from the high priest who can
[1:23:20] be seen who can be touched by the
[1:23:21] feeling of our infirmity
[1:23:25] I thank my God always on your behalf now
[1:23:27] look he he knows what he's going to
[1:23:28] write right he's going to write rebuke
[1:23:29] all their sins but he still thanks God
[1:23:31] that there's a church in Corinth ah
[1:23:34] despite all their mistakes despite all
[1:23:36] their sins and troubles brother manam
[1:23:37] said they were always brother manam said
[1:23:39] in that sermon Corinth was always in
[1:23:41] trouble that's what he said always in
[1:23:43] trouble with somebody always problems
[1:23:46] always divisions or schisms and sin
[1:23:48] always in trouble he said but those
[1:23:50] Ephesians they were a mature Church
[1:23:52] Hallelujah in other words they weren't
[1:23:54] always in trouble they were led by the
[1:23:56] spirit of God they were taught by the
[1:23:58] spirit of God they had Revelation and
[1:24:00] Revelation overcame the gates of hell
[1:24:02] that were in their
[1:24:04] lives Hallelujah I know I'm going along
[1:24:07] for forgive me here
[1:24:08] I'm ah go so fast he says uh I thank my
[1:24:13] God on your behalf for the grace of God
[1:24:15] which is given you by Jesus Christ thank
[1:24:16] God for the grace on the Corinthian
[1:24:18] Church that in everything you're
[1:24:19] enriched by Him in all utterance see
[1:24:22] everything they utter in all knowledge
[1:24:24] see God's God's life uh or God's spirit
[1:24:27] enriches your life what are the best
[1:24:30] times of your life brother Austin told
[1:24:31] me before when he gets a witness right
[1:24:34] what the best times of your life when
[1:24:35] you get to praise God love the Lord
[1:24:37] testify about Jesus right see somebody
[1:24:39] saved or whatever witness to somebody
[1:24:41] those are the best times why because
[1:24:42] it's enriching you God's spirit is
[1:24:45] anointing you and you're giving
[1:24:47] knowledge you're uttering something for
[1:24:48] the
[1:24:49] Lord even as the testimony of Christ was
[1:24:52] confirmed in you so that ye come behind
[1:24:55] and no gift they didn't lack any gifts
[1:24:57] at this church they had all the
[1:24:59] gifts waiting for the coming of our Lord
[1:25:02] Jesus
[1:25:04] Christ Hallelujah so Paul was thankful
[1:25:06] remember he starts this is how he starts
[1:25:07] the letter he starts it with the
[1:25:09] Positive he starts with it like God has
[1:25:11] called you there's some Believers in
[1:25:14] there there are some Sanctified Saints
[1:25:16] in there and God has blessed you who
[1:25:19] shall also confirm you until the end so
[1:25:21] God's going to confirm you God's going
[1:25:22] to strengthen you God's going to
[1:25:23] establish you all the way to the end
[1:25:25] just got to get through the hard times
[1:25:27] when they're sin in the church right
[1:25:30] that you may be blameless in the day of
[1:25:32] our Lord
[1:25:33] Jesus God is faithful by whom you were
[1:25:37] called unto the fellowship of his son
[1:25:39] Jesus Christ Our Lord now Church were
[1:25:42] they were they in any condition close to
[1:25:44] blameless were they close yet no but
[1:25:46] Paul knew whatever God started God's
[1:25:48] going to
[1:25:49] finish and all those I say like this all
[1:25:51] those that want to be blameless can be
[1:25:53] blameless Hallelujah
[1:25:54] because the power of the Cross
