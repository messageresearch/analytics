[13:19] we move on first prayer requests I told
[13:24] brother John I'd pray for him he said
[13:25] he's still having pain in his hip I told
[13:27] him I pray for him and he's also had
[13:28] some other personal battles so I said
[13:31] we'll pray for him by the grace of the
[13:33] Lord also I want to pray for Revelation
[13:38] because we need to pray for Revelation
[13:40] more than anything else how do you
[13:42] understand that I word we really want
[13:45] more revelation and brother Graham said
[13:46] revelation is thus saith the Lord we
[13:48] want to know thus saith the Lord for our
[13:50] lives so let's pray for that I just had
[13:52] that burden that's one thing we can all
[13:54] pray for and then those two requests
[13:58] then we'll have a special from other
[14:00] amen so it's good to see him by God's
[14:02] grace our sister who are good to see you
[14:03] god bless you any other prayer requests
[14:06] that we need to take the Lord tonight
[14:08] Haven okay yeah we'll pray for Benjamin
[14:11] Austen certainly will do that I don't
[14:19] know if you saw but Austin's mom made us
[14:22] a little gift for the church it says
[14:23] faith hope and love on it and for
[14:26] Christmas she made that for us and she
[14:27] said thank you for treating us like
[14:29] family yeah so I just thought that was
[14:31] nice you know
[14:32] and I don't ask about Austin you know
[14:35] but they're just nice to know that you
[14:40] know she said she said something along

[31:42] appreciate it amen praise the Lord okay
[31:51] let's go to Revelation chapter 3 I want
[31:53] to continue on the church ages tonight
[31:55] when I studied yesterday in prayer I
[31:57] just felt like I want to try to get a
[31:59] little bit further here try to finish
[32:01] this up I have a couple series lined up
[32:04] I'm gonna do Lord willing
[32:07] as soon as I get done with the church
[32:08] ages I've had this burden for a couple
[32:12] years now to preach a series on the
[32:14] entire life of Christ I know that's a
[32:18] pretty big series that kinda that's why
[32:24] I know it's not me because I wouldn't
[32:25] approach that thought it's gonna be it's
[32:28] got to be God you know because you know
[32:31] we spent so much time on our message
[32:32] doctrines which was great we've covered
[32:34] many of them I was looking at the series
[32:36] a brother branham John preach on
[32:37] demonology and so I've just been feeling
[32:40] led because brother none makes a
[32:41] statement where the bride has her
[32:42] ministry has to match Christ's ministry
[32:45] earthly ministry before the rapture and
[32:48] so if we examine Christ's ministry I
[32:51] think we can gain a lot of wisdom
[32:54] because no one ever lived like him
[32:56] and I don't live like Jesus
[32:59] so I've that's where I've been I'm
[33:02] writing down all these thoughts you know
[33:03] and just trying to prepare for this
[33:05] tremendous series yeah maybe it'd be
[33:07] short I don't know but I've had a burden
[33:10] to look at that series and I want to
[33:13] finish the ephesians 1 let me go back to
[33:15] the david series as well i never
[33:17] finished that series but i've surely
[33:19] been enjoying this church ages this is
[33:21] but i've got so many of us say the lord
[33:23] to me personally i feel like i've
[33:24] received so many of the seit the lord's
[33:27] and I can see why brother BAM said it
[33:29] was so necessary for us in this hour
[33:32] now Wednesday night Lord willing or by
[33:34] God's race when the night we looked at
[33:36] the open door and I finished the open
[33:38] door by God's grace head alright four or
[33:41] five services just on the open door
[33:42] there's so much in there so we're gonna
[33:44] go to revelation 3:9 everybody men you
[33:48] have to leave at five brother for your
[33:50] work but you know work tonight well
[33:52] glory amen you know I've been texting
[33:54] back and forth and some nights he has to
[33:57] work at six so I told him I said if you
[33:58] come from four to five I'll try to close
[34:00] right at five so he doesn't miss
[34:02] anything you know and that just gives me
[34:04] a little break to I don't know if you
[34:05] noticed but my voice has really come
[34:07] back you know God has given me some
[34:08] grace and my voice has come back so I'm
[34:09] very thankful to the Lord for that and I
[34:13] kind of overdosed on my wife made me
[34:16] some cough drops and they had nits in
[34:18] them and I hope they are I overdosed on
[34:20] him but they really helped me but now I
[34:21] got like a rash you see I you could see
[34:23] like a red rash around my mouth
[34:24] cuz I had too much meant but it really
[34:27] helped my throat so I'll take this
[34:29] because my throat feels really like it
[34:31] comes back like I was screaming and
[34:32] preaching in North Carolina and then the
[34:33] next day you know it came back a little
[34:34] bit so I do want to thank the Lord for
[34:36] that revelation 3:9 but we just want to
[34:43] thank the Lord for all the Saints coming
[34:44] out to the house of Lord tonight in God
[34:48] will bless you for your service as we as
[34:50] we try to seek more revelation tonight's
[34:56] message you know in the church age book
[34:58] is going to deal with the false Jew
[35:00] we're look at the judgment of false Jew
[35:02] and it's always good to look at the
[35:03] false so you can know the true that's
[35:06] why it's so important you remember a
[35:08] couple well I should say three weeks ago
[35:11] I preached on the dole hearing did I
[35:13] don't had him over here I think sister
[35:15] when he was here you know Connie was
[35:17] here but I'm not sure who was able to
[35:18] hear it but brother Branham makes a
[35:21] statement he said what is me preaching
[35:22] and me preaching he took us back to
[35:26] Hebrews 10 you remember that where he
[35:28] said those people that partake of the
[35:30] word of God and then trample on it he
[35:34] said that's the me preaching that's like
[35:35] Judas so when we can show when we can
[35:39] show what a real Christian
[35:40] looks like that's deep preaching but we
[35:42] have to contrast that to someone who
[35:44] hangs around because a make believer I'm
[35:47] sorry because unbelievers not gonna
[35:48] deceive the elect in other words there
[35:52] won't be it's easy to pick out an
[35:53] unbeliever you know I could Pharaoh or
[35:55] something like that
[35:56] it's easy to pick that out it's more
[35:58] challenging to identify that tear and so
[36:01] what we want to see we want to look at
[36:02] our lives and not point at people and
[36:03] say there's a tear there's a tear but
[36:05] it's Lord help me to learn from this
[36:06] situation like jesus said remember Lot's
[36:08] wife stir up my mind by remembering me
[36:12] reminding me what I must live like and
[36:15] what I must avoid that's why we want to
[36:19] look at these things program so this is
[36:21] me preaching so he also called me
[36:23] preaching trying to got a service
[36:25] without doing his will so that's making
[36:27] sure every single thing in our life
[36:28] lines up with God's Word that's
[36:31] beautiful amen hallelujah relation 39
[36:36] behold I'll make them of the synagogue
[36:38] of Satan which say they are Jews and are
[36:41] not but do lie behold I'll make them to
[36:45] come and worship before thy feet and to
[36:46] know that I love thee and we know thing
[36:51] that we've already preached little bit
[36:52] on this the way that they know Jesus
[36:54] loves them is because Jesus lets them
[36:56] sit on the throne with him amen that's
[37:00] how we're to prayer every need on your
[37:01] heart just making known unto God tonight
[37:03] Heavenly Father God we just stand in awe
[37:06] of you we thank you for your mercy thank
[37:09] you for the word that you're still
[37:10] revealing today we realize lord god
[37:13] there's so much word that we can still
[37:16] learn there's still much there's much
[37:19] growth we can have in our lives if the
[37:21] rapture has been pushed back Lord God or
[37:24] if the rapture isn't for however many
[37:26] days or months or years that means
[37:30] there's time for us to bear much fruit
[37:33] lord help us to bear much fruit we know
[37:35] every man will be judged according to
[37:36] his works Lord God we know that because
[37:38] faith is produced I'm sorry because
[37:41] faith produces works and every man has
[37:43] to have faith so Lord just take this
[37:46] time make it real special to us we pray
[37:48] speak to our hearts Jesus Christ name
[37:51] the church said Amen god bless yous
[37:53] being seated praise God
[37:55] so now I can switch over when you're
[37:57] ready
[38:09] all right so we're reminding ourselves
[38:11] it's the Philadelphia Church age and
[38:14] then messenger John Wesley seven his
[38:20] life was 1703 to 1791 praise the Lord
[38:26] now I didn't have a chance to put the
[38:27] date up there cuz I was wondering
[38:29] yesterday if I was gonna preach it or
[38:30] not but it's Sunday January 7th p.m. so
[38:35] I'll add that have to add that later but
[38:36] this is part 51 in the series so I'm
[38:39] thankful to the Lord for giving us these
[38:41] numerous messages praise God
[38:45] okay so let's look at the judgment of
[38:47] the false Jew you'll find this in the
[38:49] church age book this is page 310 in
[38:52] there by the grace of the Lord now we
[38:58] read our scripture there and the part
[39:00] we're going to focus on in the scripture
[39:01] is that yellow part which say they're
[39:03] Jews and are not but do lie behold I'll
[39:10] make them to come and worship before thy
[39:12] feet and to know that I love thee so
[39:16] Jesus is he promises them if you
[39:18] overcome I'm gonna make all these liars
[39:21] recognize that you're the ones that I
[39:24] actually loved
[39:25] now don't get wrong he had God had a
[39:26] love a sovereign love that he died to
[39:29] save everybody but there's only the only
[39:32] the elect have a special kind of love
[39:34] because only elect really know him
[39:37] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[39:38] they're the only ones that really know
[39:40] because remember he told the Matthew 7
[39:42] he told those people he said I never
[39:43] knew you depart from me that work
[39:45] iniquity so they never they never came
[39:47] in to know Christ he never came into a
[39:49] personal relationship into a filling of
[39:53] the Holy Ghost it never came into that
[39:55] aren't you glad you know Jesus aren't
[39:58] you glad Jesus loves you and one day
[40:01] he's gonna show all these lying people
[40:03] that say they're Christians all the
[40:04] liars now we don't know who they are
[40:06] necessarily we have a lot of we have a
[40:07] lot of corrupt fruits we can see and
[40:09] identify but really we don't know until
[40:12] the day of judgment really and so he's
[40:14] gonna make them to know the ones that he
[40:16] did love
[40:18] now the the profit rights now we can
[40:21] note immediately that this problem of
[40:23] the false Jew or false believers was
[40:25] already in existence in the Second Age I
[40:27] don't know if you remember that those
[40:32] who falsely call themselves Jews
[40:34] appeared right after the first
[40:35] outpouring of the first age and now they
[40:37] appear again in the second age after the
[40:39] Reformation did you notice that in the
[40:41] church age book I made these yellow they
[40:45] had to battle the synagogue of Satan
[40:46] remember that and then now it's repeated
[40:49] if you read in that even the scripture
[40:50] it says that they both had the battle
[40:53] the synagogue of Satan and the brother
[40:55] Graham said it's because God first at
[40:56] outpouring in that previous age God
[40:59] outpour up horde the day of Pentecost so
[41:01] Satan sets up his synagogue and then
[41:04] brother have said God poured out his
[41:05] Reformation period in the time of Luther
[41:08] so Satan comes around and mimics it
[41:10] again with his own church which say
[41:14] they're the believer but they're lying
[41:17] okay so that's that's a great
[41:20] observation the Prophet makes you know
[41:21] outpouring and then Satan mimics he's
[41:25] always impersonating but man so this is
[41:28] hardly an accident indeed it is not
[41:30] accident it is the principle of Satan so
[41:32] now you know the principle of God he's
[41:35] the same yesterday today and forever and
[41:36] now you know the principles Satan that
[41:38] principle is to organize so see make a
[41:42] Creed get a belief system that you cling
[41:45] to and you don't receive anymore new
[41:48] revelation that's that's his that's his
[41:50] principle try to get the people to
[41:52] organize around what they know right now
[41:55] so see so that means they're not hungry
[41:57] for more of God they just want to stay
[41:59] lukewarm
[42:01] in their current beliefs they're not
[42:03] open to God giving them more see and
[42:10] they claim originality and therefore
[42:12] they feel like they're entitled to
[42:15] special rights and privileges let me
[42:19] show you back there in the Somerton age
[42:20] these people lied and said they were
[42:21] actually jews or believers when they
[42:23] were definitely not they were of the
[42:26] synagogue of satan they were satan's
[42:27] organized crowd for it was in that age
[42:29] we saw the start of men in the ministry
[42:32] taking an unwarranted leadership over
[42:34] there ministering brethren bishop set up
[42:40] in districts over elders okay so
[42:42] hopefully we don't never see this in the
[42:44] message where brother Jesse tries to be
[42:48] the bishop over the other churches
[42:50] that's that's praying ask God for that
[42:53] never to happen that was the synagogue
[42:56] of Satan because now man is in control
[42:58] of man but God wants the Holy Ghost in
[43:00] charge of man that's why as much as I
[43:04] love brother Brooks or brother Craig
[43:05] they're not the pastor I'm the pastor
[43:07] you know I can gain wisdom from them but
[43:10] I don't call them up and ask them how to
[43:12] run the church I pray and ask God I
[43:15] guess God for the word of God and I've
[43:17] had to learn that you know to slowly
[43:18] learn that you know just to just pray
[43:22] you just pray myself I can ask for
[43:23] advice and things like that but I've
[43:24] learned that you know but this is how it
[43:28] was manifest the principle of Satan get
[43:32] man over man get men leading man get men
[43:34] trustee and men more than the power of
[43:36] God that something
[43:38] Paul said I when I came amongst you I
[43:40] didn't try to no impress you mess with
[43:42] my words he said I tried to know Jesus
[43:44] Christ and him crucified that your faith
[43:46] was saying the power of God amen
[43:50] the power of the Holy Spirit not the
[43:52] wisdom of man that's right he said they
[43:58] were he said the next thing we saw was
[44:00] that in the Third Age there was
[44:02] definitely a place called Satan's seat
[44:04] which was the literal city of Pergamos
[44:06] remember he went from the city of
[44:08] Babylon to Pergamos that neuroma number
[44:12] we learned on the church age it's a
[44:14] literal seat of Satan because the Bible
[44:17] said the Vatican is the cage of unclean
[44:20] and hateful bird that age gave us church
[44:25] and state marriage with the power of the
[44:27] state behind her the church was
[44:28] literally physically invincible now
[44:32] sometimes we complain about the time we
[44:33] live in church but we've actually got it
[44:35] pretty good because they could literally
[44:38] kill you now we know what's coming to
[44:40] that but its members happen this second
[44:42] age we have the revival here Satan
[44:44] mimicked it with a sin
[44:45] of Satan with false Christians they were
[44:48] claiming to be original claiming to be
[44:49] the true church and then after that what
[44:52] came marriage of church and state and
[44:54] now we're gonna see the same thing
[44:56] happen next remember the open doors
[44:58] Godhead
[44:59] Jesus is named the word all the things
[45:01] we enjoy today hey I'm so glad we got
[45:03] the name of Jesus say hallelujah
[45:06] now I have another slide with the
[45:09] Philadelphia facts next but God broke
[45:12] the hold in spite of the power of the
[45:15] state and the Reformation brought great
[45:17] light but what happened the Lutheran's
[45:19] organized and join with the state and
[45:21] again we see the synagogue of Satan
[45:23] manifested in the six-h now of course
[45:26] the synagogue group wouldn't say they
[45:27] are Satan like I'm an email this guy
[45:30] this Baptist about the the Godhead this
[45:33] week and he said all denominations are
[45:36] good I said every denomination is gonna
[45:39] take the mark of the beast I said
[45:40] they're all of Satan and I'm telling a
[45:43] guy there's on the email because they
[45:47] limit the Word of God they receive I'm
[45:50] sorry they will not receive any further
[45:52] revelation thought no one to say after
[45:57] that pardon me yeah and then he and I
[46:05] was I basically said that to him I said
[46:08] the deceived ones never know they're
[46:10] deceived right they never know his
[46:12] brother I'm saying it's the same thing
[46:14] here they don't know their deceit they
[46:15] think they're right but remember the
[46:17] Bible said God will give them a lie if
[46:20] they won't take the truth God will let
[46:22] them believe a lie and just so you know
[46:26] you know I was really struggling with
[46:27] this Trinity guy this week I just wanna
[46:30] let you know God brings fresh revelation
[46:31] or you can bring back previous
[46:33] revelation and it's just as fresh let me
[46:36] give you the example the gentleman in
[46:38] the email said he said see God is three
[46:41] persons in one being I said that's
[46:45] nonsense
[46:46] and so I'm sitting there you know just
[46:48] praying and typing and all of a sudden I
[46:50] felt I felt like something dropped down
[46:52] from heaven every now not like him that
[46:54] happens and the scripture came to me
[46:56] Hebrews 1:3 he
[46:59] one three humor what it says Jesus
[47:01] Christ is the Express image of his
[47:03] person
[47:06] so Jesus Christ is the exact duplication
[47:10] or replication of the person of God so
[47:15] the person of God is Invisibles the Holy
[47:17] Ghost and Jesus Christ is the image of
[47:20] that one person not a second person he's
[47:23] the visible image of the person and so I
[47:27] said sir the literal Bible calls God one
[47:31] person and you're so you're saying
[47:34] there's three persons in one person you
[47:37] make God a psychological basket case
[47:39] because there's three person he says
[47:42] three persons and but the Bible said
[47:43] there's one person so he's noticed his
[47:46] words three persons in one being he
[47:48] won't say what the Bible said the Bible
[47:50] said there's one person he won't say
[47:53] three persons in one person because we'd
[47:54] all know that's blasphemy we all know
[47:57] that's a constant contradiction but when
[47:59] that dropped out I said how do I just I
[48:01] got real excited I called Simon Estes
[48:03] Simon this just dropped down from heaven
[48:05] I forgot all about this this is right
[48:07] because he can't add to the Bible the
[48:09] Bible says one person and if you add a
[48:12] Creed if you have that add the
[48:13] Athanasian Karina says three persons if
[48:15] you add that then it has to line up with
[48:16] the Bible if it's right but we know
[48:19] what's wrong so you can't say he's three
[48:21] persons one being you have to say he's
[48:23] three persons in one person and now
[48:25] you've got some type of mixed-up God
[48:27] you've got it try theism which is the
[48:29] worship of three gods they met and he
[48:33] said I think you're low confused I said
[48:34] you're the one that's confused I'm not
[48:37] gonna be used I said I'm not adding
[48:38] anything to the Word of God you're
[48:40] adding to the Word of God so that was a
[48:43] blessing and then Simon brought out of
[48:44] Scripture in job you might if we turn
[48:46] there real quick job thirteen I believe
[48:47] it's job thirteen seven I could be wrong
[48:49] on that but don't quote me on that
[48:51] let's go check it out there's a couple
[48:54] times the Bible said God only has one
[48:55] person and that beautiful the Bible it
[48:59] defends itself yep there it is now look
[49:06] at verse three
[49:07] surely I would speak to the Almighty and
[49:08] I desire to reason with God but ye are
[49:11] forgers of lies his three miserable
[49:13] comforters you guys produce lies here
[49:18] all physicians of no value oh that you
[49:23] would altogether hold your peace Oh wish
[49:25] you close your mouth and it should be
[49:27] your wisdom how I'm sorry here now my
[49:30] reasoning and hearken to the pleadings
[49:31] of ellipse will you speak wickedly for
[49:33] God and talk deceitfully for him will ye
[49:37] accept his person will you will ye
[49:42] contend for God so what his job say job
[49:44] was a prophet the job call him person's
[49:47] will you accept his person's no he said
[49:50] will you accept his person do you how
[49:52] the Bible has two or three witnesses and
[49:54] the mouth of two or three witnesses let
[49:56] every word be established now while
[49:59] you're there go to Isaiah 28 because I
[50:01] had the same thing happened twice in one
[50:02] day I was so happy I that's what I
[50:04] called it both silent said Simon I had
[50:05] to striking moments just with the
[50:08] scripture I turned on the court of the
[50:10] day on that app that the voice of God
[50:11] sent out I try to do that and listen to
[50:13] the court of the day programs preaching
[50:15] about how the rest is the baptism of the
[50:17] Holy Ghost and he quotes Isaiah 28
[50:20] because I've been in another email of a
[50:22] kind of battle with this other
[50:23] sabbatarian guy who keeps going back and
[50:26] forth with me on the Sabbath look at
[50:29] verse 11 isaiah 28:11 for with
[50:32] stammering lips and another tongue will
[50:33] he speak to this people to whom he said
[50:35] this is the rest wherewith he may cause
[50:38] the weary to rest and this is the
[50:41] refreshing yet they would not hear a
[50:44] brother branham in that quote brother
[50:45] BAM screamed it out he said this
[50:47] stammering lips and another tongue when
[50:48] I speak to the people he said this is
[50:50] the rest he said it's not a Saturday
[50:53] it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh my
[50:56] just it was like you know it was just
[50:59] like all the burden of that email just
[51:01] dropped off me because we can see right
[51:04] here God is saying this is the rest it's
[51:07] the Holy Spirit amen now if you got your
[51:10] Bible go to first Corinthians 14 because
[51:14] I want you to see that in the scripture
[51:15] that just really helped me you know
[51:17] because as you know as a Christian why
[51:19] sometimes I forget the scriptures
[51:21] it was such a relief all right it's kind
[51:32] of hot in here is anyone else hot in
[51:33] here
[51:34] yeah can you turn and open that window
[51:36] again brother bang thank you sir sorry
[51:38] about dad know you're busy it's not good
[51:40] to turn the air on hot and cold you know
[51:42] it's got it's bad for the furnace so if
[51:44] we just opened the window hopefully
[51:45] that's okay I don't anybody fall asleep
[51:49] now after their supper because I I could
[51:53] do yesterday I did fall asleep after
[51:54] eating my lunch I was so tired
[51:57] first Corinthians 14 21 in the law it is
[52:05] written without with men of other
[52:06] tongues and other lips will I speak
[52:10] under this people and yet for all that
[52:12] they will not hear saith the Lord
[52:14] wherefore tongues are for a sign not to
[52:16] them that believe but to them that
[52:18] believe not but prophesying serveth not
[52:20] for them that believe not but for them
[52:23] which believe so verse 21 is a quotation
[52:27] of Isaiah 28 can you see that with
[52:31] stammering lips and other tongues as I
[52:33] speak to my people this is the rest and
[52:35] so Paul quotes a scripture and says with
[52:37] stammering lips
[52:38] I'll speak to this people it was the
[52:40] Holy Spirit praise God it was the
[52:42] tongues that fell on the day of
[52:43] Pentecost amen all right I hope you can
[52:47] see that now I kind of got off track
[52:49] there but I hope that's okay yeah they
[52:51] will not say they're up Satan they would
[52:54] never say that their say their have God
[52:56] but they lie for he that is a true Jew
[53:00] that which they claim to be as one whose
[53:02] Jew inwardly in the spirit so then if
[53:04] they are false Jews it means that as I'm
[53:08] sorry it means that they are as Jude 19
[53:10] says having not the spirit children of
[53:14] God are born of the Spirit
[53:16] these have not the spirit and therefore
[53:18] they are not children of God no matter
[53:20] how fervently they protest and to what
[53:22] lengths they go to try to prove that
[53:23] they are Wow
[53:26] striking so let's look at this so we saw
[53:29] this earlier this repeats down here
[53:31] because we have the synagogue of Satan
[53:33] but actually comes later
[53:34] first the the organization of Lutheran's
[53:36] produce a marriage of church and state
[53:38] and then brother Branham said then the
[53:40] synagogue of satan' came in the next age
[53:42] so you have the same thing happening say
[53:44] it's Satan's principle wherever there's
[53:46] a wherever there's a revival what does
[53:48] he try to do he tries to raise up people
[53:50] that are not born again that are really
[53:53] not revived right and get them to claim
[53:56] that they are revived but by their works
[53:59] you shall know them by the word you'll
[54:02] know them amen now remember the false
[54:08] will always separate themselves from the
[54:10] true just like Judas Judas eventually
[54:13] left the true Church and that's what
[54:15] Jude 19 says let's go back to there
[54:16] Jude 19 remember this is important for
[54:22] us to know so we must always remember
[54:26] this here
[54:27] verse 18 Jude 18 how that they told you
[54:31] there should be mockers in the last time
[54:32] who should walk after their own ungodly
[54:35] lusts these be they who separate
[54:40] themselves sensual not having the spirit
[54:45] to see the Judas of our day the sinners
[54:50] of our day that pretend to be believers
[54:51] they're gonna separate themselves from
[54:54] the true believer right and they're
[54:57] gonna do it based upon the principle
[54:59] that they're original and then they're
[55:02] gonna live in their lusts praise God we
[55:06] got to make sure our flesh doesn't get
[55:08] too comfortable in this world praise God
[55:11] and make sure we got to do we got to go
[55:13] to great lengths to make sure our flesh
[55:16] doesn't get too comfortable and that we
[55:20] are able to let me say I this move up
[55:24] with the Holy Spirit when the Holy
[55:25] Spirit says move up dedicate more
[55:27] sacrifice more like this morning we got
[55:29] to be able to respond and say yes even
[55:32] if it means leaving the comfort of your
[55:35] life last night my wife and I were in
[55:37] the kitchen we were listening to what
[55:38] house will you build me when Perry green
[55:40] was dedicated orbs are ordained as the
[55:42] pastor there and brother Branham says he
[55:45] said that's what he said that's what God
[55:46] does he said I had
[55:48] everything in jeffersonville he said we
[55:49] had a great church revival going he said
[55:51] we had all these things and God had me
[55:53] leave all of that to come out he said to
[55:56] SOT he said was a spiritual desert he
[55:58] said I'm sure it was good while you guys
[56:00] were there I don't know what it is now
[56:02] hopefully it's a blessing now but he
[56:03] said all the ministers were against
[56:05] everybody he said it was high cost of
[56:07] living there wasn't good wages he said
[56:09] but God has to do he said sometimes the
[56:12] Spirit of God will cause you to do
[56:13] different things than you would thought
[56:16] and so we have to be mindful have that
[56:18] too that we don't get too comfortable
[56:20] it's the Holy Spirit wouldn't let
[56:21] brother Brandon get too comfortable he
[56:23] said around his people and with no bills
[56:26] and nothing to pay off the Holy Spirit
[56:28] wouldn't let him get uncomfortable his
[56:31] flesh and we must pray the same thing
[56:33] Lord help me to remain a faithful
[56:36] servant keep me from becoming
[56:37] comfortable in this world keep me
[56:40] looking to try to get out of here
[56:42] someday by God's grace this world is not
[56:45] my home right this what I mean is that
[56:47] Laodicea is not my home but I'd say like
[56:50] this this world is my home because the
[56:52] New Jerusalem is coming down to this
[56:54] world it's in one way the Kosmos are not
[56:57] my home but this world is my home amen
[57:00] my eternal home now sinners their home
[57:02] is lake of fire they're gonna be
[57:04] ultimately abolished and done away with
[57:05] but our home is this earth but it'll be
[57:08] our new earth by God's grace new heavens
[57:10] and new her Alleluia
[57:12] all right so as program said they're
[57:15] dead they're sensual they only know they
[57:17] want to live in their lusts and have the
[57:18] preachers and their congregation say
[57:21] it's okay to live in your lusts and
[57:23] they'll separate themselves from the
[57:25] true Holy Ghost filled group but barbra
[57:27] have said they're dead they're children
[57:28] of organization and the true fruits are
[57:31] missing see something's always going to
[57:33] be missing they're gonna lacking their
[57:34] me lacking things they're built upon
[57:38] their own creeds dogmas and doctrines
[57:40] and the truth is not in them for they
[57:43] have taken their own councils above the
[57:45] Word of God praise the Lord like brother
[57:49] Branham said anytime you find me off the
[57:51] Word of God he said meet me privately
[57:53] he said let's search that thing out so
[57:54] we can get it right do we have any
[57:56] doctrines at the Bride of Christ
[57:57] fellowship that that are off the word I
[57:59] hope not
[58:01] I don't see any but see that's how Satan
[58:04] slips in where we start exalting our
[58:06] thoughts above the Word of God we must
[58:10] never do that we must always have the
[58:14] true fruits of the Holy Spirit now he
[58:20] says let me show you what I've been
[58:21] trying to teach all along about the two
[58:24] vines which come from two different
[58:25] spirits take the example of Jesus and
[58:29] Judas so brother has been trying to
[58:30] teach us this the whole time during the
[58:31] church ages these two spirits two vines
[58:34] take the example of Jesus and Judas
[58:36] Jesus was the son of God Judas was the
[58:38] son of perdition God entered into Jesus
[58:40] Satan entered into Judas Jesus had a
[58:44] full Holy Ghost ministry because the
[58:47] Bible said God anointed Jesus with the
[58:50] Holy Ghost and with power who went about
[58:51] doing good and healing all that were
[58:53] oppressed of the devil for God was with
[58:55] him now says of Judas for he was
[59:00] numbered with us and had obtained part
[59:03] of this ministry so he had a part in the
[59:06] ministry but he wasn't in it all the way
[59:09] he wasn't fully dedicated into it there
[59:12] was areas of his life that were really
[59:15] sold out to God which was money right
[59:18] that's well get to so he had a part and
[59:22] when he called unto him his twelve
[59:24] disciples he gave them power against
[59:25] unclean spirits to cast them out and he
[59:27] all manner of sickness and all manner of
[59:29] disease so Judas had this power given to
[59:34] him he had power over all manner of
[59:35] sickness and all manner of disease he
[59:37] had a part in the ministry now I'm sure
[59:40] you've noticed though I'm going back to
[59:41] the start even so I was I'm Philadelphia
[59:43] I'm pulling this quote back out about
[59:46] Judas I'm sure you've noticed those
[59:49] whose names were in the book of life
[59:51] were a part of the religious order of
[59:52] the day that centered around the true
[59:54] God and the worship of him though they
[59:57] did not worship according to the truth
[59:59] everybody catch that Judas is gonna be
[1:00:02] right around us
[1:00:03] everybody everybody okay with I mean
[1:00:06] okay but everybody familiar with that
[1:00:07] I'm not okay with that but it just has
[1:00:09] to be that way
[1:00:11] Judas is gonna hang around he's gonna
[1:00:14] hang around he's
[1:00:15] never really gonna get cleaned out maybe
[1:00:17] if I have time I'll dig up that falsely
[1:00:18] adjustable justification quote there's a
[1:00:20] quote rogram said Judas genuinely went
[1:00:23] through justification sanctification and
[1:00:24] there's a quote where he says he did it
[1:00:26] he never did it he never believed so you
[1:00:28] have you have thoughts on both sides now
[1:00:30] scripturally I don't see how he could
[1:00:32] have generally been justified or
[1:00:34] sanctified scripturally but we have
[1:00:37] quotes on both sides so we just have to
[1:00:39] trust the Lord so we have to have Judas
[1:00:44] right amongst us somewhere and I'm not
[1:00:46] saying tonight hopefully not tonight by
[1:00:47] God's grace we don't want anyone here to
[1:00:50] be a Judas but here's what Judas didn't
[1:00:53] do he didn't go all the way with the
[1:00:55] word he left like the Bible said in Jude
[1:00:59] he separated himself he didn't have the
[1:01:01] Holy Spirit and yet he wasn't going to
[1:01:03] go to receive the Holy Spirit
[1:01:05] see how Judas was chosen of God he's
[1:01:07] instructed in truth he shared in the
[1:01:09] knowledge of the mysteries like we've
[1:01:11] seen preachers that have preached the
[1:01:12] mysteries but then walk away see it's so
[1:01:14] dangerous
[1:01:15] I'm not calling them Judas I'm just
[1:01:16] letting you know this is what Judas did
[1:01:17] he had a part and some of these guys had
[1:01:20] people I know like I heard them their
[1:01:22] testimony they prayed for people that
[1:01:23] were dead and came back to life and then
[1:01:25] left a message yeah I mean this is it's
[1:01:30] so important that we stay with the Word
[1:01:32] of God stay in the Word of God but see
[1:01:38] like Judas they walk away that's why our
[1:01:41] hearts go out that's why a lot of people
[1:01:43] I'll be honest that's why a lot of
[1:01:44] people don't reach out to people that
[1:01:46] leave the message because they're
[1:01:48] concerned it might be a Judas now should
[1:01:50] we go after the sheep of course do the
[1:01:51] Shepherd's grab for the Sheep of course
[1:01:53] every person that left this church I've
[1:01:55] gone after them now mostly for good
[1:01:57] reasons I don't have to go after that
[1:01:58] but when somebody leaves the message or
[1:02:01] goes back in the world you better
[1:02:02] believe I go after them I try to call
[1:02:04] them I try to visit them my wife told me
[1:02:06] one time gee I'm gonna say oh I'm gonna
[1:02:07] go show up at this person's house and
[1:02:08] just be waiting on the porch when they
[1:02:10] get home and she's like Jesse you better
[1:02:12] be careful you know you don't upset
[1:02:14] people I'm like yeah you're right just
[1:02:18] because I I just want them to know like
[1:02:20] I just want to save them you know what I
[1:02:21] mean I just want them to know how much I
[1:02:23] love them but I always want to respect
[1:02:25] their privacy too like can you imagine
[1:02:26] if you went to your house and somebody's
[1:02:28] waiting there to
[1:02:29] or for you sitting on your porch with
[1:02:31] the Bible you know I want to use wisdom
[1:02:36] but that's why I believe many people
[1:02:40] when you see the truth of God and then
[1:02:43] walk away they're concerned this might
[1:02:44] be a Judas and and people I think people
[1:02:48] out of concern don't maybe don't go
[1:02:50] after them because they don't want that
[1:02:52] person that person might try to
[1:02:53] influence them and pull them out so see
[1:02:58] and the Bible says that the Bible says
[1:03:00] you have to be very careful the Bible
[1:03:02] said you must approach somebody who's
[1:03:04] wrong in meekness and be careful that
[1:03:06] spirit doesn't get on you that's in
[1:03:08] Galatians 6 chapter 1
[1:03:10] I'm sorry chapter 6 verse 1 - you have
[1:03:13] to be so strong and yes so humble when
[1:03:15] you approach someone who's overtaken
[1:03:17] lies and you'd be careful that spirit
[1:03:20] doesn't get on you because whatever
[1:03:21] here's what I've seen with people that
[1:03:22] left there so anger is brother branham
[1:03:24] they're so angry with people in the
[1:03:27] church that that spirit of anger can get
[1:03:29] on you and then you can say they'll say
[1:03:30] something bad about somebody and if
[1:03:31] you're not careful you'll pretty soon
[1:03:33] you're started greed and what happened
[1:03:35] that judgmental critical spirit just
[1:03:37] jumped on you and so you got to have
[1:03:41] enough boldness to either reject that or
[1:03:43] just say shame on you yeah that's hard
[1:03:45] that's hard key people don't like doing
[1:03:50] that and so see some message people I
[1:03:52] could understand there might be some
[1:03:54] wisdom and some of them if they feel
[1:03:55] like I'm not meek enough I don't have
[1:03:57] enough strength to go out for them but
[1:03:58] what can they do Church that God will
[1:04:00] see they can pray they can pray if you
[1:04:04] don't feel strong enough to go after
[1:04:05] somebody you pray for them so we see
[1:04:11] that Judas healed the sick cast out
[1:04:13] Devils
[1:04:13] but when the showdown came showdown he
[1:04:18] sold out for gold and political power
[1:04:20] now what was his showdown his showdown
[1:04:22] was look Wow Jesus is here he's here in
[1:04:25] Jerusalem these Jews offered me some
[1:04:30] money it's
[1:04:33] get out Jesus is not out the winners
[1:04:34] Jesus is here in the city I can make a
[1:04:36] few dollars and Jesus he'll do miracle
[1:04:38] and he'll pass right through the Judas
[1:04:40] coulda said that I'll see him pass right
[1:04:41] through the crowd just like he did the
[1:04:43] one time and they tried to stone him and
[1:04:47] look it's all it's all perfect I could
[1:04:49] make some money I can you know show I'll
[1:04:52] just deny the word for a little bit you
[1:04:53] know because we know he repented
[1:04:56] afterward right
[1:04:57] he just repented the wrong people see
[1:05:01] just that was the showdown ah I can make
[1:05:03] a little money here but I can also slip
[1:05:05] out from the church for a little bit
[1:05:06] make a little money I'll come back no
[1:05:10] you won't know you will
[1:05:12] mercy and judgment the showdown the
[1:05:16] showdown when the showdown came he sold
[1:05:21] out for gold and political power now
[1:05:27] being in politics won't send you to hell
[1:05:30] but it'll get you really close because
[1:05:33] remember a lot lot sat in the gate of
[1:05:35] Sodom lot became a mayor brother Brahim
[1:05:37] said but look even the mayor got saved
[1:05:40] but barely barely other man said every
[1:05:44] person I know that goes in politics gets
[1:05:46] corrupted but God can save on the
[1:05:50] political system he saved lot but see
[1:05:53] there's always that intermixing of money
[1:05:54] power money power and you just thought
[1:05:57] my okay I can make a few bucks here just
[1:06:01] gotta be little gotta you know give away
[1:06:03] some of the secrets oh my so he did not
[1:06:08] go for the Pentecost to receive the
[1:06:09] Spirit of God he was devoid of the
[1:06:11] Spirit he was sensual see he was more
[1:06:14] concerned about money rather than God's
[1:06:16] word you know being fulfilled following
[1:06:18] the Word of God
[1:06:18] now recall never remember the three
[1:06:20] showdowns number three shots preach on
[1:06:23] that last year or was it two years ago I
[1:06:25] can't remember not at times going so
[1:06:26] fast our showdown is against what the
[1:06:29] organizations and their denominations
[1:06:33] and their Creed's I feel like I'm in a
[1:06:36] little warm-up with all these emails you
[1:06:37] know these denominational matters they
[1:06:41] the one guy just called me up and I was
[1:06:44] at I didn't take it he left me two
[1:06:45] voicemails of three minutes long
[1:06:46] so six minutes of just rebuking my video
[1:06:48] on the Trinities ride and you're leading
[1:06:51] people to the pit did all these things
[1:06:53] like guys I'm leading them to the word
[1:06:54] brother I don't know if he's my brother
[1:06:56] but I said show me where I'm outside the
[1:07:00] word he could never do that because bro
[1:07:02] gram didn't bring us a denomination he
[1:07:04] brought us the word he brought us the
[1:07:06] word so there's three showdowns remember
[1:07:12] there's the mark Mount Carmel which was
[1:07:14] a physical Mountain Mount
[1:07:15] Transfiguration was physical mountain
[1:07:16] but Mount Zion is a spiritual mountain
[1:07:21] the first showdown I don't know I don't
[1:07:24] know if there was a forerunner you know
[1:07:26] I don't know but Elijah was the
[1:07:28] messenger and the showdown was with the
[1:07:30] Bale denomination's brother him said and
[1:07:33] pick up your pen and write the Mount
[1:07:35] Transfiguration was the next showdown
[1:07:37] where the man said the 4runner was John
[1:07:38] the Baptist he was the former rain Jesus
[1:07:41] was the messenger the latter rain for
[1:07:43] that age he rebuked organization and
[1:07:46] Jesus had a showdown with denominational
[1:07:47] spirit did Jesus one the word will
[1:07:51] always win amen we're always gonna win
[1:07:53] because we're walking the spirit not in
[1:07:55] the flesh now brother Brandon tells us
[1:08:00] when he says the Holy Spirit picked up
[1:08:01] your pen and write you told him that boy
[1:08:03] spirit said that seven church age
[1:08:05] messengers the forerunner brother
[1:08:06] Branham his former reign his teaching
[1:08:08] ministry Jesus will bring the latter
[1:08:11] rain which is rapturing faith brother
[1:08:14] Graham rebuked organization and brother
[1:08:16] Branham then the Holy Spirit said
[1:08:17] showdown our showdown is with
[1:08:19] denominations and Creed's because number
[1:08:23] remember revelation 13 what are they
[1:08:25] gonna do you're gonna get the mark in
[1:08:26] the hand or the mark in the forehead or
[1:08:29] the RAM said the forehead is to think
[1:08:31] their doctrine the hand was to do the
[1:08:33] will of the world system Academical
[1:08:36] system remember brother Ram
[1:08:39] the Holy Spirit said the bride is going
[1:08:41] to be forced to stop preaching so we
[1:08:44] know it's prophecy I think we talked
[1:08:45] about that
[1:08:46] it's prophecy if we're the true bride
[1:08:49] that world economical system is going to
[1:08:51] shut us down
[1:08:52] but listen Church they'll never shut
[1:08:53] down the Church of the Living God we'll
[1:08:55] just go somewhere else if if we live to
[1:08:58] see it I hope we do
[1:09:01] if not we'll praise the Lord and maybe
[1:09:03] our next generation but they're gonna
[1:09:06] they're gonna force the bride to stop
[1:09:08] preaching the Word of God they're gonna
[1:09:10] force her to stop but she really won't
[1:09:12] stop she's gonna keep preaching just in
[1:09:14] a different angle a different ministry
[1:09:16] and we know that's called the third Pole
[1:09:18] praise God brother Graham said the third
[1:09:22] Pole we'll sit quiet for a while until
[1:09:24] that persecution picks up till the
[1:09:26] squeeze comes on then he said what
[1:09:28] you've seen in a minor way will manifest
[1:09:29] in a greater way think about the minor
[1:09:32] healings like brother Cobb I was talking
[1:09:35] about he had a cane he couldn't walk
[1:09:36] upstairs when I can run upstairs we've
[1:09:38] seen the third pole operate in a small
[1:09:40] level right K I'm talking with the
[1:09:43] brother about you speak the dear gonna
[1:09:45] get tomorrow and he got an 8-point dear
[1:09:47] it was thus saith the Lord we prayed for
[1:09:49] a sister with the blood issue and God
[1:09:53] healed her right there on a spot you
[1:09:55] know you see it operate in small way I
[1:09:57] spoke twice to mountains of infertility
[1:10:00] and they moved twice in one year and
[1:10:02] both couples had children you know it's
[1:10:06] just speaking by the leadership of the
[1:10:07] Holy Spirit we've seen it in a minor way
[1:10:10] but brother BAM said it'll pick up in a
[1:10:11] great way once this squeeze comes on
[1:10:13] amen
[1:10:16] that's right so there's three showdowns
[1:10:19] so Judas fell in his showdown so see
[1:10:22] that denominational spirit he fell well
[1:10:24] Graham said make no mistake about a
[1:10:26] person that's truly how many one to be
[1:10:28] truly baptized I don't want to be like
[1:10:31] maybe baptized how would it be truly
[1:10:33] baptized well maybe he's got the Holy
[1:10:35] Ghost no I want to have all the Holy
[1:10:37] Ghost amen
[1:10:38] into the body of Christ receiving the
[1:10:40] fullness of the Spirit will be in the
[1:10:42] word all the way a really Holy Ghost
[1:10:46] real person loves the word cuz Christ is
[1:10:49] the one hurting that
[1:10:51] the word was made flesh and one among us
[1:10:53] a man when he comes back he's got a name
[1:10:55] on his vesture it's the Word of God
[1:10:57] hallelujah the Bible said he'll have a
[1:11:00] name which no man will know but then the
[1:11:02] Bible said his name is the word of God
[1:11:04] hallelujah Christians love the word they
[1:11:09] can't get enough of the word amen
[1:11:11] because Christ is the word that's the
[1:11:14] evidence of being baptized with the Holy
[1:11:15] Ghost Judas failed multitudes fell right
[1:11:18] there and when they failed to go on that
[1:11:20] word their names are taken off the book
[1:11:21] of life oh it's such a great thing to be
[1:11:24] called to the gospel but it's also a
[1:11:26] serious thing too because if you fail to
[1:11:30] go on that's where denominations fail if
[1:11:31] they fail to go on and make idols their
[1:11:34] names get blotted off the book of life
[1:11:36] that's right remember Jesus Jesus said
[1:11:39] this is that one soul he goes he said
[1:11:41] when the spirit of truth comes he'll
[1:11:43] guide you into speaking in tongues no
[1:11:46] sir he'll guide you into all truth the
[1:11:49] truth and then you'll live the truth you
[1:11:52] will manifest the truth and Jesus said
[1:11:53] thy Word is truth now let's not be
[1:12:00] discouraged you know Christ is slowly
[1:12:02] purging our lives how many can say amen
[1:12:04] to that the word is slowly purging you
[1:12:08] might battle with something for weeks or
[1:12:10] months or a year a couple years but God
[1:12:12] is eventually he's gonna purge that out
[1:12:14] of your life and you're gonna be free
[1:12:16] from that how do you know what I'm
[1:12:17] talking about
[1:12:18] maybe pressure maybe it's a pressure
[1:12:20] from this family or a pressure here at
[1:12:22] the job or or just maybe fears and all
[1:12:25] these things you all these problems or
[1:12:28] all these maybe bad habits or something
[1:12:30] but if you stay with God long enough the
[1:12:33] word will take effect and the word will
[1:12:35] move that mountain it has to amen
[1:12:38] because the word cannot be defeated
[1:12:40] hallelujah we just got to stay with him
[1:12:43] the word is truth that spirit that was
[1:12:48] in Judas now we're back to Philadelphia
[1:12:49] the spirit that was in Judas went right
[1:12:53] along through the Ministry of Jesus then
[1:12:59] they both came
[1:12:59] to the cross Jesus was hanged upon the
[1:13:02] cross gladly giving his life for sinners
[1:13:04] and commended his spirit to God his
[1:13:09] spirit went to God and then was poured
[1:13:11] out into the church at Pentecost but
[1:13:13] Judas hanged himself and his spirit went
[1:13:15] back to Satan but after Pentecost that
[1:13:17] same spirit that was in Judas came back
[1:13:19] to the false vine and that grows right
[1:13:21] along with the true vine that's right
[1:13:24] with us it's right among us but notice
[1:13:27] Judas spirit never got to Pentecost it
[1:13:30] went up to receive the Holy Spirit it
[1:13:32] could not do it I'm sorry never went up
[1:13:34] to receive the Holy Spirit see how it
[1:13:36] important is see when people just come
[1:13:38] up for the Holy Spirit sorry right time
[1:13:40] or if people just come up for the Holy
[1:13:43] Spirit
[1:13:44] you can already say I've done something
[1:13:45] Judas never did Judas never went up to
[1:13:49] receive the Holy Ghost oh my how that
[1:13:51] ought encourage us amen if you come up
[1:13:54] for the Holy Ghost if you've got on your
[1:13:55] knees for the Holy Ghost if you've cried
[1:13:57] out for the Holy Ghost
[1:13:58] you've already showed you're not a Judas
[1:14:00] because he never went up to receive it
[1:14:02] but you and I go up to receive it amen
[1:14:04] that's exactly right he never went up
[1:14:06] who seemed got to humble ourselves say I
[1:14:09] want the Holy Ghost I want to be filled
[1:14:11] with power under me fill with God's love
[1:14:13] I want to be in the very image of Jesus
[1:14:15] Christ Judas never did that Judas never
[1:14:19] was humble enough to say I want to go up
[1:14:21] to Pentecost money was his thing money
[1:14:24] it was all about money now one thing I
[1:14:29] want to say too I heard a preacher
[1:14:30] preach on it
[1:14:31] that spirit went right along through the
[1:14:34] ministry of Jesus I heard a brother say
[1:14:37] this and it was quite striking and Loras
[1:14:38] and Karen might know a lot about this
[1:14:39] but a lot of the people that were around
[1:14:41] brother Branham when he was on earth a
[1:14:44] lot of them not saying all of them not
[1:14:47] all of them many of them many of those
[1:14:50] people were the ones who started false
[1:14:53] doctrines later on down the road I mean
[1:14:56] I heard a preacher preaching and he
[1:14:57] named about seven false doctrines that
[1:15:00] came out of people that were right there
[1:15:02] with brother Branham members tape boys
[1:15:05] they went started to what was that a
[1:15:07] camp
[1:15:08] his tape boys started to camp out in
[1:15:10] Arizona gee
[1:15:13] I'm sorry Leo and Jean and they turned
[1:15:17] out to be homosexuals and yet they they
[1:15:20] help brother branham in the ministry for
[1:15:21] years and years some of these other
[1:15:25] brothers brought frost doctrines about
[1:15:27] Peru's or the Friends of God we don't
[1:15:30] need the Holy Ghost anymore the Holy
[1:15:31] Ghost is already here and it just killed
[1:15:35] the churches some of these churches that
[1:15:37] accept these doctor no more praying for
[1:15:39] the Holy Ghost
[1:15:39] no more fasten no more power of God and
[1:15:42] they denominator and die and start
[1:15:45] compromising cutting their hair wearing
[1:15:47] makeup cussing and bringing TVs in their
[1:15:50] home and living off the things of the
[1:15:52] world it's people that were right along
[1:15:53] with brother Branham but see give it
[1:15:58] some time and every seed will produce of
[1:16:00] its own kind amen glory that's why so
[1:16:04] thankful as time goes on we're seeing
[1:16:06] the fruits of all these people we can
[1:16:10] look at the fruits and see what is this
[1:16:11] producing what is this producing and
[1:16:13] church that's look at our life let's see
[1:16:15] what fruits were producing can we look
[1:16:18] back 10 years ago 5 years ago what
[1:16:20] fruits are we produced since then
[1:16:21] there's our life look more like the word
[1:16:23] or we getting off into things we
[1:16:26] shouldn't get into that's striking to me
[1:16:30] that's striking some of the brothers
[1:16:33] that brother branham ordained to preach
[1:16:34] got into some terrible false doctrines
[1:16:36] terrible awful false doctrines maybe I
[1:16:43] shouldn't say that but one of one of the
[1:16:44] brothers started a church there in New
[1:16:46] York and when he died they prophesied
[1:16:48] and this is what I told this what I was
[1:16:50] told by the brother Yvonne in New York
[1:16:52] his followers said he prophesied before
[1:16:55] he died he thus saith the Lord he would
[1:16:57] rise again in three days and so they
[1:16:58] waited in New York at his gravesite and
[1:17:01] he never rose again he never but this
[1:17:05] was the this was the spirit see wherever
[1:17:08] there's false doctrine there's going to
[1:17:09] be spirits around there because that's
[1:17:12] what it produces false doctrines produce
[1:17:14] a wrong spirit and so now they follow
[1:17:18] some somebody else in that organization
[1:17:21] or denomination and this was a guy who
[1:17:23] sat on her brother branham and brother
[1:17:24] BAM ordained and agreed preacher you
[1:17:27] it goes right along with it but by their
[1:17:29] fruits they'll be known no amen god help
[1:17:32] us to have the right fruits and I'm not
[1:17:33] calling names or I'm not trying to be
[1:17:35] critical you understand I'm just trying
[1:17:37] to show you the reality of this we've
[1:17:40] got to be very careful let me try to
[1:17:42] finish I'm losing time losing track of
[1:17:44] time because I'm just having a good time
[1:17:46] but what did that Judas spirit go for
[1:17:48] Church it always it went for the bag of
[1:17:50] gold how it loved money that's what I
[1:17:54] was saying earlier if people get more
[1:17:56] excited out here in a fellowship or I
[1:17:58] just got some more money or yeah I feel
[1:18:01] if they get more excited about money
[1:18:03] than worshiping Christ well you better
[1:18:05] watch that person this is what he loved
[1:18:09] he loved to hold the bag for the
[1:18:11] ministry the money nice to feel bad for
[1:18:15] John because he was the treasurer you
[1:18:16] know but now I'm the treasurer and the
[1:18:19] treasurer hold the money but I don't
[1:18:22] love it
[1:18:23] God knows that I don't love it I don't
[1:18:25] love to hold the money but Judas loved
[1:18:28] money
[1:18:29] he said his spirit still loves money
[1:18:32] today if it goes about doing in the name
[1:18:36] of Jesus doing things holding great
[1:18:39] meetings that still makes more of money
[1:18:40] and buildings and education everything
[1:18:42] with the material concept in mind so
[1:18:44] what do these people get most excited
[1:18:45] about big buildings education
[1:18:48] educational systems money big meetings
[1:18:53] can everybody understand that
[1:18:55] the Judas spirit doesn't get excited
[1:18:57] about a small little fellowship where
[1:18:59] they're clapping singing praising the
[1:19:01] Lord they want to see big they want to
[1:19:02] see money they were to see big lights
[1:19:04] they want big big big money money money
[1:19:06] that's why God reveals himself in little
[1:19:09] things simple humble things I found the
[1:19:14] core brother Graham said as soon as you
[1:19:16] build a new church he said that people
[1:19:17] fall away because they just get excited
[1:19:19] about the building something to consider
[1:19:23] now I don't you're wrong I'd like to
[1:19:25] have a bigger Church you're talking
[1:19:26] about that lunch I'd like to have a
[1:19:27] bigger Church you know our own church
[1:19:28] building then you got all the expenses
[1:19:29] you know new roof and new all that stuff
[1:19:31] like that but that ramp said that's the
[1:19:33] reality because we're just human and if
[1:19:35] we're not careful if we're not
[1:19:36] spiritually on our toes st. will start
[1:19:39] tricking us to think well
[1:19:40] we're better because we got a bigger
[1:19:42] building has nothing do with the
[1:19:44] building it has everything to do with
[1:19:45] obedience of the word we must love the
[1:19:49] holy spirit and not love money in other
[1:19:53] words what the Holy Spirit brings
[1:19:54] repentance because jesus said the Holy
[1:19:56] Spirit will convict you of all things
[1:19:58] when he comes healings salvation
[1:20:02] sanctification we don't like to say that
[1:20:05] all the time but that's right it's gonna
[1:20:07] sanctifies it's gonna cut us it's gonna
[1:20:09] purge us Judas didn't like that because
[1:20:11] he never got it purged out of his life
[1:20:13] he loved money and big things and big
[1:20:16] campaigns and bigger big buildings
[1:20:18] he loved the big money stuff more than
[1:20:19] he loved just the Word of God there's
[1:20:22] nothing wrong with big meetings every
[1:20:23] now and not their own with that but when
[1:20:26] people get more exciting that big things
[1:20:28] money things then the word of God
[1:20:30] something's wrong with their life see
[1:20:34] just watch that spirit watch it that's
[1:20:36] why I say if anyone ever seems like they
[1:20:38] got the wrong spirit just watch him for
[1:20:39] a while it's gonna manifest the seed
[1:20:42] inside of every person who's gonna
[1:20:44] manifest you just sit there and watching
[1:20:46] you make sure your fruits are the right
[1:20:47] kind of fruits don't be fooled he said
[1:20:50] don't be fooled
[1:20:51] Judas went about as one of the twelve
[1:20:53] and did miracles too but he did not have
[1:20:55] the Spirit of God he did have a ministry
[1:20:57] though he never got to Pentecost as he
[1:21:00] was not true seed he was not a true
[1:21:03] child of God no sir and is that way
[1:21:05] right now in the synagogue of satan' no
[1:21:07] be fooled you won't be fooled if you're
[1:21:09] the very like Jesus said you wouldn't be
[1:21:11] fooled yes these folks say they're
[1:21:13] Christians but they aren't look at you
[1:21:16] 111 woe unto them for they have gone the
[1:21:18] way of Cain so Jude lumps all these guys
[1:21:22] together Cain Balaam and Korah and they
[1:21:26] ran greedily after the error of Balaam
[1:21:28] for reward now what does reward mean
[1:21:31] look at this church reward means wages
[1:21:34] higher and think of all the brothers or
[1:21:37] even sisters that sell out God just for
[1:21:40] more money just a bigger job make more
[1:21:43] money it's just the wages just wages
[1:21:47] it's just higher they sell a run
[1:21:50] greedily after more money rather than
[1:21:52] staying with the Word of God
[1:21:54] oh goodness perished in the gainsaying
[1:21:58] of korah remember core came in what
[1:22:01] accord you core came against the prophet
[1:22:03] in the priesthood and said we can all
[1:22:04] minister with with incense we can all go
[1:22:07] in there and God said no you can't only
[1:22:10] those who are called the Friends of God
[1:22:11] can go in the presence of God and that
[1:22:13] day you had to be born into it in this
[1:22:15] day you got to be born into it too but
[1:22:17] it's born by the Holy Ghost just and not
[1:22:21] anybody can go in there any old way you
[1:22:22] got to come God's provided way see lumps
[1:22:28] all these people together Kane what came
[1:22:29] to Kane went with beauty rather than
[1:22:31] blood
[1:22:34] Balaam went with money more than Holy
[1:22:36] Spirit Holy Ghost living you want to get
[1:22:40] people to fornicate when to make some
[1:22:41] money one to try to curse Israel now you
[1:22:44] couldn't do it so he tried to do it
[1:22:45] through there he knew God would curse
[1:22:46] them if they sinned in fornication he
[1:22:48] tried to teach them false doctrine to
[1:22:49] make a little money and then kora came
[1:22:52] against the prophet in the priesthood
[1:22:54] that's why I be careful if someone comes
[1:22:55] against the fivefold ministry or comes
[1:22:57] against brother Branham watch that
[1:22:58] spirit that's a core spirit his core
[1:23:02] came against both not just one came
[1:23:04] against both that's exactly right
[1:23:07] I'm almost done here I know I know it's
[1:23:09] getting late I want to preach my voice
[1:23:12] out I'll be praying God hear my voice
[1:23:13] again you know my voice again well why'd
[1:23:15] you preach so long all right thank you
[1:23:18] Lord I'm almost done yeah I only got
[1:23:20] three more slides is this helpful
[1:23:24] tonight I hope it's a good reminder
[1:23:25] remember the Bible said so simple the
[1:23:28] way to get stirred up is remember
[1:23:29] remember stir up your minds by way of
[1:23:33] remembrance remember what a Holy Ghost
[1:23:36] life is like it's not in love with money
[1:23:38] it's in love with righteousness it's in
[1:23:41] love with the Word of God and you go up
[1:23:44] to get the Holy Ghost you go up you make
[1:23:46] you cut everything off like we said this
[1:23:48] morning cut everything off in order to
[1:23:49] be clean and be used by God but he that
[1:23:58] lack of
[1:23:58] these things is blind this is the stache
[1:23:59] perfect man and cannot see afar off have
[1:24:01] forgotten he was purged from his old
[1:24:02] sins he forgot he was forgiven so it's
[1:24:05] dangerous when you don't feel forgiven
[1:24:06] it's dangerous
[1:24:07] it means you're not it means you're not
[1:24:09] letting the virtues of the Holy Spirit
[1:24:11] flow through you you've got a clog
[1:24:14] you've clogged up a flue there's some
[1:24:16] sin got in there and the life of God is
[1:24:18] not flowing out of you if we forget
[1:24:20] we're forgiven which goes along with
[1:24:23] this morning's message about being cut
[1:24:25] off wherefore the rather brethren give
[1:24:27] diligence
[1:24:28] now that means all you're after all your
[1:24:29] interests give all your interest to make
[1:24:32] your calling and election Shore which
[1:24:35] means stable and firm see this is what
[1:24:37] we wanted right a Christ fellowship we
[1:24:39] just want stable believers we want firm
[1:24:42] believers believers that love the word
[1:24:45] that's all we want because that's what a
[1:24:48] real Christian life produces people that
[1:24:51] want to live on everybody no unstable in
[1:24:53] Christ Jesus I am a firm I'm unmovable
[1:24:58] in the Word of God hey man let's Satan
[1:25:01] bring in floods and storms and all these
[1:25:02] things against me I'll stand there like
[1:25:04] a soldier
[1:25:05] I'll stand there like a statue amen my
[1:25:08] brother and I'll stand there like a
[1:25:09] weathervane amen
[1:25:10] I'll just stand there and I'll do every
[1:25:12] rain and and do every hardship and do
[1:25:14] every struggle because I'm making my
[1:25:16] election sure I'm letting the devil know
[1:25:18] that I'm elected amen and I'm gonna give
[1:25:21] all my interest to show them that I am
[1:25:22] elected hallelujah see we must do faith
[1:25:26] we must do virtuous things we must do
[1:25:29] knowledge we must accept patience we
[1:25:32] must accept temperance God is really
[1:25:33] kind of cherrywood we must do these
[1:25:35] things if we do these things will never
[1:25:37] fail we must do the word if I preach
[1:25:41] something try to live it that night try
[1:25:43] to live it that Monday don't forget
[1:25:45] about it and that same thing for me what
[1:25:48] I preach I must go home and live and
[1:25:53] then I'll never fall to Satan's devices
[1:25:57] gotta let that flow through me I've got
[1:26:00] to stay true to the word gotta stay
[1:26:02] humble
[1:26:02] I gotta love Jesus more than money we
[1:26:05] all have to do that
[1:26:06] alright last few here seemed like there
[1:26:09] was something I want to say to maybe how
[1:26:11] Jesus maybe there's something I thought
[1:26:12] I forgot I just feel like I was wanting
[1:26:15] to bring something else out Philadelphia
[1:26:18] Church H okay yeah this the last one
[1:26:20] there's two more this is the last
[1:26:22] thought so this is the part about worse
[1:26:24] coming to worship and remember a couple
[1:26:26] months ago I preached on this on all the
[1:26:30] events after after the rapture was after
[1:26:34] Armageddon yeah all the events yeah like
[1:26:37] the mayors suffer all the events after
[1:26:38] the marriage supper like being
[1:26:39] introduced by the Prophet then rewards
[1:26:42] given out memory preached on that coming
[1:26:43] back at Armageddon and then the white
[1:26:45] throne judgment we preach on all those
[1:26:46] different the order of events the
[1:26:48] possible order of events
[1:26:50] I'll make them so that's the Faust you
[1:26:53] come and worship before thy feet and to
[1:26:56] know that I have loved thee and the
[1:27:01] Bible said do you not know that the
[1:27:02] Saints should judge the world you know
[1:27:07] when I think about a church think about
[1:27:08] how many people I may have to judge how
[1:27:10] many people have come in and sat in this
[1:27:11] church and left in disobedience how many
[1:27:14] people I may have to judge I don't want
[1:27:16] to judge people I don't want to have to
[1:27:18] stand there like the Queen of the South
[1:27:19] and I you know in other words I don't
[1:27:21] want to see people lost of course I'll
[1:27:25] have to stand there and say yes I was
[1:27:27] able I was able to live a Christian life
[1:27:29] with six or 7 children I was able to put
[1:27:33] God first and I was able to serve the
[1:27:35] Lord and be a pastor and have a
[1:27:37] full-time job
[1:27:38] whatever testimony God wants to get out
[1:27:40] of me I'll be able to stand there and
[1:27:41] say I by God's grace he helped me do it
[1:27:43] but I don't want to see people don't
[1:27:46] want to see people lost but this is what
[1:27:49] the brother have said this is how God
[1:27:51] will do it God will show these false
[1:27:53] Jews these are the ones I loved because
[1:27:56] they live such a life on earth they're
[1:27:57] worthy to judge now and that's because
[1:27:59] they judged rightly while they were on
[1:28:02] earth and we must judge rightly right
[1:28:04] now not only will there be 12 apostles
[1:28:09] on twelve Thrones judging the twelve
[1:28:10] tribes of Israel but the Saints also
[1:28:12] will judge the world that is when those
[1:28:14] who claim to belong to God and claim
[1:28:17] that God loves them will find it exactly
[1:28:19] who is the child of God and who is loved
[1:28:22] of the son don't you see it with your
[1:28:24] friends
[1:28:25] see on Facebook all the time God loves
[1:28:26] me God loves me God loves me and I say I
[1:28:28] don't know I don't know if God loves
[1:28:29] them it depends what they did the foss
[1:28:32] you think God loves them I don't know if
[1:28:36] that was between me between them and God
[1:28:39] did they really love God because member
[1:28:42] both groups say God loves me God loves
[1:28:44] me but God really only loves one of them
[1:28:48] yes that day is coming when it will be
[1:28:50] made manifest he said I'm gonna come
[1:28:52] show the false Jews the ones that I love
[1:28:55] that I really loved you those who are
[1:29:00] now ruling the world in a measure and
[1:29:02] who during the last age will build an
[1:29:05] image to the Beast whereby they will
[1:29:07] actually rule the world will one day be
[1:29:09] humbled when Jesus comes with his Saints
[1:29:12] to judge the world in righteousness
[1:29:16] that's exactly what we saw Matthew 25
[1:29:19] and all the ones who missed the first
[1:29:22] resurrection will stand before the judge
[1:29:24] in his bride oh my okay let's say to our
[1:29:29] feet here I'm gonna look up this quote
[1:29:31] stay stay on here Malachi I told you I
[1:29:33] was a that's what I was going to I was
[1:29:34] look at that Judas quote from the
[1:29:36] Philadelphia Church age I think he said
[1:29:46] you
[1:29:47] falsely yeah there it is Lauren okay
[1:29:53] yeah there's paragraph 224 in the photo
[1:29:55] features a Judas when he was here on
[1:29:58] earth he met up with Jesus made a
[1:29:59] confession that he was a believer in
[1:30:01] Jesus and become the treasurer packing
[1:30:04] all the money is that right you all know
[1:30:07] that now if he believed on Jesus Christ
[1:30:09] he accepted falsely justification in the
[1:30:14] seat of discrepancy brother Bram said
[1:30:15] Judas never had faith to begin with he
[1:30:18] had a pretend faith is that right Romans
[1:30:22] 5:1 therefore being justified by faith
[1:30:24] that's right he said all right falsely
[1:30:29] because the member of the Bible said
[1:30:31] this I said earlier he thus justified
[1:30:35] he's already glorified I mean grd have a
[1:30:40] glorified body yeah whom he did
[1:30:43] predestinate them he also called and
[1:30:45] whom he called them he also justified
[1:30:47] and whom he justified them he also
[1:30:49] glorified amen
[1:30:51] that's why I leaned to that side Judas
[1:30:54] never really was justified to begin with
[1:30:56] he never really was sanctified brother
[1:30:59] Bram said you can walk through the
[1:31:01] stature of a man and just have a human
[1:31:02] faith a human virtue a human knowledge
[1:31:05] of human temperance our human patience
[1:31:07] which the Buddhists do they are very
[1:31:11] temper they're very patient people we've
[1:31:14] met some of them
[1:31:16] one time see they can mimic those things
[1:31:21] but if God justifies you there's a
[1:31:23] glorified body waiting for you hey man
[1:31:26] there's an eternal body waiting for you
[1:31:28] in the heavens hallelujah do you just
[1:31:31] love money he never really loved Christ
[1:31:33] he loved the money that followed Christ
[1:31:35] instead of loving Christ oh how we
[1:31:38] should love Christ Church how we should
[1:31:41] love this word no matter what happens to
[1:31:43] us financially if God blesses our
[1:31:45] businesses or model our lives and we get
[1:31:47] more finances praise God but if not
[1:31:49] would you still serve Him of course of
[1:31:52] course
[1:31:52] oh he slay me yet I'll trust him praise
[1:31:57] God
[1:31:57] hope this was a blessing now if you look

[1:32:04] eulogy in the promise that's one two
[1:32:07] three pages the promise to his own is

[1:32:14] admonition is half a page you got four
[1:32:16] more pages to get through this glorious
[1:32:18] chapter so I am really excited I'm
[1:32:21] really excited to preach the church ages
[1:32:26] because I know I knew what a tremendous
[1:32:29] revelation it was from God I was just
[1:32:31] waiting for the right time and I believe
[1:32:33] God has given many of these things that
[1:32:34] I said to us at the right time I really
[1:32:37] believe that and I'm thankful for that
