TRANSCRIPT
========================================
let's have a few prayer requests here and i'll stand and read our scriptures i love that song i am nothing without him praise god jesus plainly told us that in john 15 5 thank you sir he said without me you can do nothing so we thank god that he gives us a little part to play in our humble little lives here on this earth you know he can he can take our life at any time but thank god he gave us this life he showed us so much grace and so much love and he's just sort of showed us so much in the short little life that we have that it's worth just spending every moment every every time we have to be in the house of lord to worship god and sing his praises it's worth it because we get to be with him all throughout eternity whatever we have to sacrifice here whatever to miss out on what would seem like a missing out on it'd be better to be with jesus christ it'd be better to worship him better to be one day in his courts and a thousand elsewhere praise god hallelujah our lives are so blessed to be in the house of the lord thank god for his mercy here so let's go uh let's take a few prayer requests actually here and then we'll get to a reading of our word uh just a few prayer

text from the mj so just keep him in prayer he said sorry he missed sunday but he's going to try to be back this weekend so just keep him in prayer he said he had a dream he thinks he thinks my children and i were in it and he said he said i felt such a holiness of the holy ghost and he said i feel led to keep coming back and hear the word of god amen oh thank you buddy i was really encouraged by that about praise the lord and i sent him a video of us singing after the baptism and he sent the emoji with the cry and he said that was so beautiful they're singing uh went down to the crimson river remember that i sent a little video on that and he just he said oh i'm just crying thanking the lord another soul came in the kingdom of god where's little victoria she must be in there she wants to praise god and she go coming up on monday tuesday she's like daddy i'm a real christian i said you like me i said you've been baptized you've been you come in the name of the lord jesus i said there's a place for you in heaven i said you're a part of the body of christ let the little ones come unto me jesus says ephesians five and six let's read that together one two three which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that the gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel amen all right let's go to isaiah 41 verse 10 please isaiah 41 verse 10. hallelujah jesus is with us we have nothing to fear praise god he will strengthen us he'll help us he'll uphold us praise god let's read that on three one two three fear thou not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen thee yea i will help thee yea i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness amen may god add us blessings to three of his word you may be seated praise god okay so we're going to try to pick up lord willing where we left off last week uh with uh the the challenges and blessings of transitioning into one body we'll look at that here i'm gonna i gotta skip ahead uh to where my place is here remember last week we were looking at all the challenges you know uh with circumcision and uh fellowshipping with people that maybe seem uh you know unclean to us right and uh as we uh as we think about our lives you know these some of these things don't affect us very much as far as like the jew and gentile it's more of the rich and poor right and the uh and the the nicely dressed and they're not so nicely dressed or people that take care of themselves and people that don't but it's still something we have to uh grow in as far as the love of god should be constantly growing in our hearts right and we should we should be tender hearted the bible says one toward another forgiving one another as christ forgave us and and so we're grateful that god has given us such a wonderful church you know and and people that we love and uh the saints of god that we we love to come and be with we should just fall more in love with each other as the years go by i found that to be true you know uh here at our church and then you know the saints that we fellowship with in different churches we just we love them more we look forward to them coming more praise god and i asked by us brother cam if he'd maybe come out in july for us so we're going to talk we'll be praying about that and i'm going to come out have some meetings i told brother brooks i was texting brother brooks today about coming out and him coming out i may have him come with brother randy i thought about that because they're a pretty good dude though they used to go to church together they're a really good team so i i may do that instead because i really i really like to have more services with brother cam's ministry there kind of feeling led to do that uh maybe i have three with him by god's grace but just kind of just praying and waiting on that so let's look at this uh thought here you know we saw how this impacts us we got to be very careful um our attitude towards others right we've all seen church splits right we've all seen uh uh church problems and people leave churches and many times it's because there's just a lack of love right people just don't have enough love for one another or their disfellowship with certain people instead of like making things right instead of trying to solve the problem they'll run away from the problem and that's a form of uh that's a form of fear right like we saw with peter he had fear he feared the jewish preacher so he didn't eat with the gentiles and so anytime fear is in a situation we've got to overcome that right because the holy spirit doesn't bring fear of man it brings fear of god right and i've always liked that saying i've always liked i fear god too much not to make things right with other people right i don't want to fear people and not witness to them and i i've been guilty of that right i've asked god to forgive me times when i didn't witness when i should have but what's always helped me is remembering i fear god more than i fear that person's reaction right and that's how it's attitude i want to have i want to fear god and with so much love for god that that motivates me to not fear the individual because this is not a flesh and blood affair praise god right we're wrestling against spiritual powers and wickedness in high places and if we just pray up right if we just listen to a sermon if we just sing a few songs then the fear of god will come upon us the love of god will come upon us and we won't be afraid of that person anymore right and so that's a great uh promise that we have now i want to look at some of the blessings here as they transition into one body first philippi i'm just going to briefly go over these and then we're going to get into some uh some timelines here uh for the jew gentile church uh remember philippi we preached on the book of philippians last year and into the beginning of this year it was paul's first european church that he started on his second missionary journey and this was probably his most warmest and most personal book right because in chapter one he thanked god every time he remembered this church oh thank god for the saints in akron right that's how we should thank god we have a church in akron right and he he was convinced that god would finish the good work that he started right and they had a place in paul's heart he eagerly longed to see them again he said i greatly long to see you their loyalty the philippian loyalty was above all the other churches at least to this point because he said all other churches have not ministered to my needs except your church what a what a testimony that uh of when when the prophet was getting forsaken and when the prophet's needs weren't being met one church stepped up and it was the philippian church one church stood with the prophet i want to be that church praise god i i believe there will be more than one church standing with god's prophet but i want to be a real church that stands for god's prophet praise god the word of god that he pointed us to and you know the other side i was looking at a few websites at branham tabernacle this week the other side did just keep going further and further like this week they had an article that said oh we're just willing to die for every word on the tape you imagine that hang their souls and they said we're willing to die for every word on the tape i'm like i'm not because not every word on the tape is thus saith the lord just just to think about saying things like that it's so far uh beyond of what uh uh a person with discernment should should say anyone with discernment would know a man's not infallible outside of christ christ is the only infallible man because if a man's infallible then he's perfect he's god he needs to be worshipped but that man is jesus that's one spot's taken is we're not reserved for anybody else praise god but just you know i'm so thankful to be on this side praise god we're really standing with god's prophet amen amen right we really are while others pretend to be or maybe think they are they're deceived into it but we're one of the few churches that are standing with the word of god amen we won't exalt brother brahm said you know brother man said the seventh church age messenger deserves no greater honor than john the baptist right he was a forerunner we thank god for the forerunner but his whole mission was to point us to christ amen that's what we are we're being pointed to christ amen we never forget god's forerunner we thank god for god's foreign but he had his part moses my servant is dead he said but now he said i'll be with you as i was with moses amen so see it but it's hard for people to hear that it's because they don't have faith and they're not born again praise god remember joshua had another spirit praise god that's what made him different amen him and caleb had a different spirit they were like those old fighters right there one to worship moses or or anything like that they had a their their their own spirit the holy spirit and they wanted to possess god's promises for their day i don't want to die and start a denomination in akron i want to be a living breathing organism amen the living breathing temple of god lively sown a living body praise god where christ dwells where's the tabernacle of the living god amen hallelujah i don't want to start a denomination and die i want to be a part of the living body of jesus christ amen so you can always speak his word to us and and and guide us here to the future as long as we'll be here to guide our steps give us vision for without a vision that people perish we don't want to perish we want to be rescued we want to be saved we want to be delivered we want to go in the meeting in the air in the rapture praise god we want to get married in the wedding praise god amen hallelujah but they were this was the loyal church the philippians they were stood the heretics right and the legalists in the last chapter paul says they're the only ones that met the need and he said you'll have a great heavenly reward for meeting the prophet's needs i like that now this thing about that that's the kind of relationship a jew preacher and gentiles that's what the body of christ does it makes such loyalty between different nationalities right different blood right different i'm sorry all one blood i mean different nations that's what i mean different nations can all be united because they're united by the spirit praise god not the flesh or not anything else they're united by the holy spirit praise god it's the holy spirit that brings unity amen that's what paul said a jew preaching a bunch of gentiles he said he said we're you're loyal and you've you've met my needs and god's gonna reward you my god shall supply all your needs hallelujah next was the thessalonians paul wrote two letters to them they had a deep emotional bond paul really loved these churches that god had him start he really even though this this stay was very short and lord willing i'd like to preach this in the future of the lord jerry's preacher the whole book this was also started during a second missionary trip paul thanked god because of their unceasing work of faith and labor of love despite persecutions he said he was like a gentle nurse i read that this morning actually it was in chapter two paul said we're like a nurse among you now could you imagine many message preachers like nurses brother william that's what paul says we were very careful how we behaved amongst you church can i help you anybody need any help today can i uh can i give you anything can i help you out you know how a nurse comes in and you're wanted to treat you nice you're in pain and you want a nurse to be real kind you don't want a nurse to ball you out while you're sick that no preacher sometimes have to do that by the holy spirit but but paul said we didn't when we came we worked for ourselves we supplied our own needs right and we were gently said like a nurse among you and you know how we behave so godly among you right he was and he had such a love for them he said i took nothing of yours but giving out love only he said no he even comforted them he said you know the in chapter 4 where he talked about the rapture he gave them the rapture because they were worried about their loved ones he told them about the rapture because of that he said don't fret he said let me give you some words of comfort they which are alive and remain the dead in christ he said to rise first your loved ones that have died they'll rise first praise god and the dead in christ will meet the living saints and you'll meet the lord in the air he said comfort one another with these words amen you'll see your loved ones again you'll see those message believers that are passed on you'll see them again praise god we'll see samson day again amen we'll see these saints that have died and gone on if the lord willing we'll see them alive by god's grace before the rapture if not we'll definitely see him in the rapture praise god paul was trying to comfort them be encouraged the dead in christ will rise amen and he talked about the future meeting in the in the air praise god now the second letter he had to ball out lazy brother that didn't want to work right and he had to give correction and you had to correct them against the antichrist spirit that would try to come in the church but paul said i love this paul said my converts you are my heavenly crown you're my glory and joy praise god so see how how this love between a gen a jew a jew preacher the gentiles before they were despised but now you're my crown before you were dirty and filthy and i don't want nothing new with you but now your your life for jesus christ that's my joy before you were my thing i hated you know but now you're my joy that's what the love of jesus does amen and make an enemy your best friend i didn't hear your enemies become your family praise god that's a great testimony to what jesus christ did when he broke down that middle wall partition or part partition praise god and made one body one church one temple praise god by the power of the holy ghost now let's go to acts 20 i want to read this because this is this is one of the most touching scriptures i think in the new testament of course outside of christ maybe i'll just say it one of the most touching in paul's life because that'd be a better way to say it because nothing could be more suitable than jesus christ nothing could be more lovable or memorable than the lord jesus but i would say one of the most touching scenes is acts chapter 20. now i don't know if you knew this but paul's longest missionary stay in any location was ephesus that's why i think he wrote such a masterful letter of the ephesians the book of ephesians where he talks about you were before the foundation of the world chosen in christ all spiritual blessings and marriage and divorce and the armor of god and everything and oh my such a powerful letter uh but this was his longest day three years according to acts 20 verse 31 yeah that's right verse 31 says that three years and notice the whole time he was teaching them but also warning them that wolves would come in not sparing the flock and you know the history ephesus the whole church with uh the history says jesus said i'm gonna take the candlestick out of the church if they didn't repent well they didn't repent so the church of ephesus was gone by i think like 110 a.d or something like that it was totally gone so paul was right under the holy spirit to warn them for three years uh remember it was through paul's ministry 12 of them initially got the baptism of the holy ghost this was a church paul it's like paul birthed them as little babies right well it's like paul had 12 little babies there apollos was out of town he prayed for them they only knew john's baptism 12 little babies born in the kingdom of god he stayed there for three years training them up teaching them up he said i've given you the whole counsel of god right so we have a scriptural uh principle that you can teach the whole council of god within three years right at least that means you know the antichrist mark of the beast seal of god uh the church ages you could preach all of it at least within three years probably sooner if you really if you preach all night like paul did i remember paul to preach all night sometimes people fall out of the upper floors and everything but notice his fair rep farewell starts in verse 17. this is a very touching and emotional scene i just want to read this here this is the kind of a bond that the holy ghost gives us and from melitus he sent to ephesus and called the elders of the church and whether come to him he sent them you know from the first day that i came into asia after what manner i have been with you at all seasons you see there are seasons of life you see within three years you can go through numerous seasons of life so no doubt they saw paul when he had a lot of things they probably saw paul like the philippians when he didn't have much they probably saw him when he was on cloud nine fired up all the time they probably saw when he was battling things right because he said i do sometimes i do sins i shouldn't do right paul said i do that i'm sorry the things that i hate those things i do so in all seasons of life they've been around him for three years and they could see the highs and lows of his life so some of you i've seen some of the highs of your life i've also seen some of the lows of your life you've probably seen some of the highs in my life some of the lows in my life times i was really discouraged or time i was really going through tough times right but through it all we've sucked together praise god through it all because we're all glued together by one thing that's god's love amen the bond of perfectness amen love amen we are we can't help it we're glued together we got the love of jesus amen hallelujah so he was there three years he said now in verse 19 serving the lord with all humility of mine and with many tears and temptations which befell me by lying in weight of the jew yeah i love it when people cry here i love it when we get to share some of those touching times together or you're shouting or you're so i love that come to church when you're sad we can pray together we'll cry together we're your real family anyway praise god right by the blood of jesus christ you know so they experienced the highs and lows of life within three years tears temptations trials now look at that lying away to the jews people are lying waiting around waiting to jump out and devour us yet we stood together praise god when the enemy tried to come in we just stuck that much more closer together people were lying in wait trying to take the liberty from our church or the joy from our church yet we stood together praise god people tried to discourage us or bring false doctrine in we just stood that much more closely together like a united family praise god he said this is what we've done we've stuck together verse 20 and how i kept back nothing that was profitable unto you but have shown you and taught you publicly and from house to house now of course you know in those days they didn't have big churches right so they had to have services from house to house right we're thankful we have a little house or a little place here we can come together but he didn't keep back anything church and i tried to do the same thing i've not kept back anything from this church that i think would help them the thing that i think is going to help you the most is be born again because if you got if you get born again then you've got christ in you praise god i've got christ in me then we've all got christ praise god amen that's the most important thing we can give you praise god but not for me like if there's something i could preach on that would help you let me know we'll do another questions and answers sir series and we can do that it's been a couple years since we've done that i'd be happy to any question about the message i'll be happy to answer any questions i may not put it on the live stream you know because some people some questions are kind of personal when i tell personal stories i cut off the live stream but i'm trying not to get back anything that's profitable for the people because i want them to know the truth about god's word verse 21 testifying both to the jews and also the greeks repentance toward god now this is see the main thing is repent right have faith toward our lord jesus christ that's the trouble a lot of people go down the water a sinner they come up out of the water a sinner right paul look at this paul recognizes the main problem here is people don't repent praise god right they go through the motions they go through water baptism but they don't really repent all the way that's what we got to make sure we repent of all things that remember we have evil we make up for our sins and we change our mind about our sinful lives praise god we've got to be fully convinced brother ram says when you're convinced and you're concerned amen i think but you've got to be convinced right like that story i was telling you some you know sisters have left our church and they always kept pants in their closet well they weren't convinced it was cross-dressing they weren't convinced it was abomination because if i was convinced something was abomination i'd get it out of my house because i don't want curses in my house right if you're convinced i'm sure then you'll be concerned praise god and paul says i taught you to repent i've taught you to love the lord jesus have faith in jesus amen have faith that he's with you have faith that he's for you that faith that he'll provide all your needs if you forsake the world he won't forsake you praise god verse 22 and now behold i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there remember the holy spirit when the holy spirit first called paul remember what do you tell ananias he said he told ananias he said i am going to i am going to use paul as a light to the gentiles and i'm going to show him how much things he must suffer for my name's sake how'd you like that if that was your calling gotta suffer a lot how many of us would say oh sign me up brother but paul he did because remember he was there the bible said he consented unto unto numerous deaths not just stephen i read that a few weeks ago i was shocked i'm like oh i forgot about that he consented to numerous christians dying and so when christ called him he had mercy forgave his sins the bible said they washed away his sins when his water baptism got jesus washed away his sins that he was willing to suffer because he knew how he'd hurt the church of christ so much right he knew how he kicked against the pricks remember that he said like the goad he knew he kicked against that he'd hurt the body of christ right he was trying to hurt them so he was willing to suffer because of how much suffering he calls the church of god why what is what a servant paul was he says i'm so i'm going bound in the spirit to jerusalem verse 23 say that the holy ghost witnessed in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide look at that every city he visited the holy spirit said you got to go and suffer got to go and suffer talk about a talk about a meeting that would have been right preaching and worshiping the god all of a sudden a tongue's interpretation break out they wouldn't wait they wait for the interpretation it's thus saith the lord my servant paul you're going to suffer in rome thus saith the lord you think everybody would clap after that do you think they would clap i don't think so i think they probably started crying wouldn't you if you knew that was coming for you you probably started crying that's how it was for paul every city you visited the holy spirit was saying you've got to suffer you've got to suffer now watch how the sermons come across now this is a season where god has blessed us right we didn't suffer during coven can you say amen today we really didn't suffer we've had a lot of blessings during copenhagen i was telling the church and you know deploying all the blessings we've had we had blessing after blessing after blessing they just come upon us they've just been rolling out to us i thank the lord for that praise god but watch the word watch the word of the holy spirit as it comes you'll see it come in the times and seasons the word is coming forth it'll feed the flock of god but also prepare us for things to come that's what it did for paul the word prepared him for the things to come look at this he says in verse 24 but none of these things move me neither count i my life dear unto myself so that i might finish my course with joy yet he's going to suffer he's going to have joy despite knowing he's going to rome to suffer he's going to choose joy instead of depression oh the church said god help us to do that let's choose joy in the midst of trials praise god i'm going to finish my course with joy i know i'm going to suffer and be a martyr give my life for christ but i'm going to choose to do it with joy that's a real servant so okay and the ministry which i have received of the lord jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of god and now behold i know that ye all among whom i have gone preaching the kingdom of god shall see my face no more now look at this he knows this is the last time i'm going to be with you imagine having a saint like that a prophet who saw visions oh my goodness he'd be breaking in and out of visions and tell you thus saith the lord you had you had him for three years but then he says this is the last time you're gonna see my face on this earth now remember these are previously dirty people but now the blood of christ has made them one oh such a beautiful story wherefore i take you to record this day that i am pure from the blood of all men why for i have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of god that's that's i want to preach myself right that's how brother adam preached he declared the whole council of god he blasted denomination you know worldliness he just laid it all out there right he just blasted everything that was sin and raised our faith on all the things that were right praise god just preach the whole council of god let ever let as we say let the chips fall where that where they may praise god that whoever wants to go go all those who want to stay let them stay just preach the word he said preach the word in season in season out of season he said he said rebuke comfort uh uh just just preach the whole counsel of god i'm kind of forget what he said to timothy there but you understand what he's saying he said fight the good fight of faith praise god lay a hold on eternal life amen hallelujah now does that make sense if the holy spirit said you got to go suffer got to go suffer you're not going to get more popular you're going to get more rejected wouldn't that make sense if we would be a small church and god would keep us small would that wouldn't that fit the pattern right god god god's not letting us get prideful he's keeping us humble wouldn't that fit the same pattern a harder way compared to an easier way i just found a quote today where brother said that he said he's talking about abraham and lot and how lot chose the easy way abraham let lot have the choice and then he took the harder way and brother adam said see god's not always on the easy road he says sometimes you find him on the hard road but lot went to the easy road where to lead him to a very a very awful end for his family right so it's not always in the easy road there may be times we have easy roads but here paul saying you won't see me no more i've declared the whole council of god now verse 28 what would be your last words if you're gonna leave somebody what would that what what would be a preacher's fitting last words we got them right here oh i'm glad to see him what would a holy ghost anoint the prophet of god say the first church age messenger what would he say in his last words well we got him right here oh i love that don't you sometimes i just like to cuddle up to that don't you it's just oh wow we we know what he would say if he could give us any last words we know what brother brown would say if he could give us some last words if we could break behind that curtain of time we know what he'd say praise god amen like he heard keep pressing keep pressing uh it was not much longer to go praise god the victory's right ahead amen don't get weary keep pressing forward toward the mark of the high calling forget those things in the past press forward to the high calling of god in christ jesus don't quit don't give up don't be fearful do uh uh do do not to despise the trials approach them with joy praise god run your course finish your course with joy hallelujah here's these last words verse 28 take ye therefore unto yourselves so don't get loose take heed to yourselves and to all the flock of god see we have to care about the whole church we should be interested in everybody in the church to try to care for them the best we can we got to look at each other like we're a little sheep right and we've got to take care of course he's talking to the preachers here but you understand everybody should care for everybody right to all the flock over which the holy ghost have made you overseers to feed the church of god what is it what are the last words build a big church right that might be fine sometimes make sure everybody you know has you know whatever they need i mean that's of course important you know we must remember the poor but he says these last words he said feed the flock of god feed them what the word of god but i thought you already preached the whole council of god well the holy ghost is going to guide us into more truth right you got the main principles i preach the main counsel of god but we still need more feeding on those same things to go deeper in the things of god amen the bible says the holy spirit searches the deep things yay the deep things of god amen hallelujah the holy spirit always wants to take us a little deeper praise god thank the lord i like this look which he made you overseers see that's all i am as a preacher i'm an overseer i'm just trying to oversee just watch the flock and the bible said warn them and watch for their souls so what's the soul the soul is the nature right so i have to make sure your nature your soul is pointed toward christ right and you have a soul thirst my main desire is to make sure you're you're you're you're satisfying that holy thirst with the holy word of god which means come to church hear the word that's my main thing to make sure invite people back to church please come to church make sure in the house of god because i'm watching over your soul right judgment begins where at the house of god praise god your soul is going to be judged right or wrong based upon how you act and how you respond to the word of god what you're being fed in the house of god oh we should we should be thankful if we're still in the house of god being cleaned out by the holy spirit being fed on the good food of god's word amen those without the bible says scarcely will anyone be saved outside the house of god what amen warning from the holy spirit last words his last words are take heed to yourself all the church feed the church of god feed them with what milk well to the ones that need milk remember we looked at that a few weeks ago some of them need milk you know laying on of hands eternal judgment the baptisms right hebrews chapter six some people need that he said but the real me is judging between good and evil so on a weekly basis presenting uh questions and presenting doctrines and and looking at uh looking at topics where we have to discern in our current lives are we judging things as good or evil right now that's the real meat of god's word see just preaching god sent a prophet god sent a prophet that's not meat anymore because we already know god sent a prophet that might have been meat in one day but we proved it to you by acts 3 21 by malachi 4 5 and 6 matthew 17 11. right we proved it that's proof you you can judge that now you know but now it's time to move on and make sure we're keeping all the sin out of our lives now praise god that was needful for a season now that's going to be needful for mj i'm going to have to revisit i did revisit that a little bit i may go further on that as uh the lord would lead me but see we need the me of god's word is in our daily lives now to discern good and evil is this the right step or is this the wrong step that's why i see that's why you should come to the that's why we should come to church and just be hungry for the word lord speak to me today i've got this question i've got that question speak to me today that i can stay pure with the word of god that i'll i'll judge things the right way i'll judge this situation my family the right way i'll judge this situation the church the right way i'll judge this thing in my personal life i'll judge it the right way i won't let evil in but i'll overcome evil with good amen hallelujah we know god sent a prophet thank god for that we thank the lord for all the blessings but we need meat and he said feed the church of god with meat praise the lord amen now go to verse now here it is 29. i'm gonna look something up real quick 29 for i know this that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock so you better watch over them because wolves are going to come in right and they won't spare the flock they'll go right after the church see how wolves will do that many times they'll try to get to the preachers because they if they can get to the preacher then that would defile the whole congregation but in this case he said they're coming after everybody the flock as well i thank god when just someone with a false doctrine like we talked about on sunday a brother we had a false doctrine i thank god he didn't come in to get anybody else he tried to get some of us on texts he tried to get the flack on texts but i thank god that the lord just allowed him to come to me when we talked about it because that kind of kept all of you out of it right i thank the lord for that because would you like somebody texting you all the time and say oh you need this is fault you're you're preaching false doctrine oh your church does that make you feel good or bad when people do that bad oh you're there's no way you're born again and you're failing in this or that you like getting texts like that that's a wolf that's a wolf trying to take your joy right that's a wolf trying to uh devour your spiritual life and make you nervous and put a spirit of fear on you just cast that wolf down in jesus christ's name amen just rebuke him fight him off with the sword of the word of god amen say there's no condemnation to me i'm in christ jesus amen and who are you to judge me hallelujah now look verse 30 also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them see why did preachers do that many times brother william's probably seen it a preacher will get this false doctrine and he'll draw he'll split the church right and try to draw people after his to make him the pastor right usually usually it's money based usually they're after the ties every time so preacher's got to be careful who invites to the pulpit right uh but also watch the watch the parking lot preachers too we haven't had many of those thank god by god's grace but see they want to they want to draw people away after themselves with perverse preach with perverse doctrines verse 31 and therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years i cease not to warn everyone night and day with tears and now brethren i commend you to god so i'm committing you to god i'm i'm uh i'm not gonna be able to watch over you so i'm gonna have god i'm ask god to watch over you right i'm sure parents when parents when when their adult children leave the house you got to commit them to god right brother we're not there yet so let's hang around a few more years many more we'll see what the lord does but see at some point paul says i've got to commit you to god because i can't be here anymore i'm placing you in god's hands now let me tell you there's no better hands than those those nail scarred heads oh they just got a way of providing everything we ever need of amen hallelujah they just got a way to do it it's about those special hands those nails scarred him they just care so much praise god they're so strong amen so faithful praise god so big amen those wonderful powerful hands of christ jesus he says i commend you to god and to the word of his grace i'm committing you to the word of grace these are gentiles which is able to build you up so the prophet's going to leave but you can you can still get bigger hey you can still be stronger even though the prophet's going to physically leave you oh can we see it tonight church we can still grow stronger we can be built up because the holy ghost is here amen the prophet might not be here but the word of grace is able to build us up amen hallelujah we don't have to be afraid we have to be discouraged god knows how to build up his church amen he knows how to feed the flock of god if the people come hungry and thirsty they'll receive from christ amen that's beautiful i didn't even see that huh you're able to be built up when there's no profit yeah you can still do that because the holy ghost will never forsake his people right he'll lead his sheep to green uh pastures and still waters like we had a cat our cat was stuck in the up in the tree the last week right this is kind of a silly story but they finally got the cat down in case you helped get the cat down and you know you know the first thing he did after two to two nights in the tree he running eight grass i just thought that's so that's so weird you'd be up in a tree two days you haven't eaten nothing the first thing you do is go eat grass i thought that reminded me of a little lamb what's the first thing you go feast on the good grass of god yo you're all alone you're all isolated the devil's got you up in a tree what's the first thing you do when you get down have a nice meal right a nice green healthy meal that's what the cat did right and so here paul says feed them uh and they'll be able to be built up and overcome these wolves if you just feed these sheep the preachers will protect you you'll be strong enough you'll be able to overcome these wolves you'll be more than conquerors sheep that are more than conquerors sheep that defeat the wolves amen because the great shepherd's on your side hallelujah just feed just feast right satan wants you not to feast on the word he wants you to get skinny and weak right i didn't enjoy that sermon nothing in that sermon well you didn't pull hard enough you really if you really want something you say amen you poor you get focused you get spiritually minded praise god and god will pour out blessings upon us amen but the people got a poll too right they have to have faith faith comes by hearing hearing by the word of god amen he said the word of grace was able to build you up finishing verse 32 and to give you inheritance among all them which are sanctified hallelujah god is going to give you an inheritance among the sanctified ones the separated ones what a blessing look at verse 33 i've covered in no man's silver or gold or apparel hey brother amen can i borrow 500 buddy okay but william can i borrow about 600 after church you didn't see paul doing that right hey good can i borrow that that's a nice fleece brother can i borrow that man see a real man of god doesn't behave himself like that he's not interested in the outward he's not interested in the natural he's interested in the soul make sure that soul is fed the word of god praise god and i've covered in no man's silver gold or apparel hallelujah i said i love this because it reminds me of myself i gotta i gotta be faithful to my ministry praise god yay verse 34 ye yourselves know that these hands have ministered under my necessities and to them that were with me well church can you give take up a little extra offering to feed my family have i ever ever done that in 15 years of preaching i never did that my hands are ministered to my own needs well i appreciate the lord for that verse 35 i've showed you all things how that so laboring you ought to support the weak so we work hard to help out those who are weak among us that's why i tell them about the amen on sunday i said i don't you guys remember when i used some of my ties a few years ago to buy brother austin a car a used car it was a really old car and i got some i got people criticizing me for that but i'm like it's my money i can do whatever i want with my money do i tell you how to spend your money right and then i thought about the book of acts in the book of acts they made sure everybody had it all the same well i could have a i and the brother i had to drive the brother to work i'd drive into the mall to go work at the shoe store for the austin after a while i just kind of got tired of him like can i find a cheap car around here can i and jose help me find it i mean it was all directed to the lord we were able to get the title fixed on one night it just worked out beautifully but i got criticized for that and i realized now i was just doing the book of acts job there just found something real cheap because everybody should have everything in common right now other people have tests over here we have different people come in they don't have a car i've given them a bus pass just to see if they'll come to church because i knew some of their family and friends wouldn't come to church no matter how much you give them you get my bus pass i gave them a 50 bus pass they come to church one time but that bus runs all seven days of the week so they miss sunday night miss wednesday night they come one time i gave them a 50 bus pass do you think they really want to come to church they don't want to come to church now that brother austin you come to you come faithfully you all saw it come faithfully so you have that little trouble there but you know i thought that was i get criticized for that but see i'm here as a shepherd i'm here to provide for the sheep and that brother we had met numerous prayer meetings where he was crying and remember god healed him he had uh he first come in to our message and he had a migraine a really bad migraine he said lord if you're real heal me god healed him that one night can you imagine that i've never had that where i was at a migraine and god healed me he said at that instant god healed him and he was very faithful for about a year there or so but see people are going to criticize you no matter what you do in fact the last the biggest critics of me over the years have been those that criticize me how i handle the money of the church and again they don't they have no business to tell me what to do with the money i'm just trying to help out god's sheep most of the ties allow you to have that chair you're sitting on right there but most of those ties allow you to have that air conditioning coming right through there right i don't need it i don't need all of it i'm happy to do that i just want god's sheep to feast on god's grass and drink god's water amen praise god i want their souls watched over amen so they're ready for the coming of the lord amen they're they they can they don't have to worry about those natural things they can watch and pray looking for the coming of christ jesus amen hallelujah that's okay but ram said jesus was a man who lived in another dimension brother william the one thing about him he knew how to live above all the criticism amen hallelujah god help us to live above all the critics and liars amen some of you get light on we talked about that i've been light on numerous times let them lie we'll live above it praise god that's all they can do that's their only argument that they have that's the only weapon they have is argument and lies in debate but we got greater weapons than that we've got the truth we've got the word we've got the power of god we've got the love of god we got christ amen we've got honesty sincerity we got purity things they know nothing about that's right so what would your last words be if you left the church and you had to move overseas he said feed the flock of god make sure those saints are feasting on the word of god because there's going to be there's going to be wolves come in and try to separate the flock he said watch and remember the warnings that i've given you he said in other words work for your own needs right don't be a beggar right verse 35 i have showed you all things how that's so laboring you ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the lord jesus how he said it is more blessed to give than receive i told you how we had uh uh did i tell you how that company we had a company help us out in our kitchen upstairs i tell you that in january so this company gave us like a a huge discount just because and the the owner's a christian they did this construction for us at a huge discount and when i talked to him he said the lord told him to give our family that discount as love and brother there's no way i could have paid for this there's no way i could have paid for this maybe five or six ten years down the road i never could afford it because i don't make a lot of money and all the money i do make i got to pay the bills you know uh i mean we have everything we need we're very very thankful for everything but i never could afford this and the man said while he was doing our job in january at this reduced rate it was just labor he said god gave him five jobs five contracts plus the biggest contract they'd ever have and now they're so big we just talked to them last night now they're so big the the husband and wife are owners now they've hired they didn't have any employees like uh to do all the work for them now they have numerous employees now you know why because god loves a cheerful giver jesus said it's more blessed to give than receive hallelujah that's why i want to share that with you because just just a reminder god loves when you give cheerfully i'm not talking to the church i'm just talking about you give to people you give it up to the church we're gonna we're good at the church you know we're good but give to others that you may see need things right it's more blessed to give than receive so feed the flock stay with the word watch out for wolves make sure you give to people because god will bless you remember the last words when paul and and peter were there in jerusalem and james remember the last words some of the last words they said were remember the poor that were some of the last words in galatians 2 and then they left and parted what would be the last thing you'd say to a prophet of god don't forget to paint pray for the poor people make sure you give food to the poor people okay see you later like that would we would think it'd be some revelation like let me tell you about these different mysteries and let me tell you i saw this i saw this these seven thunders in the book of psalms you know which there are seven letters in the book of zombies that's still a mystery i don't know that mystery but you would think it'd be something deep like that there's seven thunders in the psalms there is and they said remember the to support the poor don't forget the poor now we need that thunders yeah we do but we can't forget to be like christ right who said blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy blessed are the pure in heart that they shall see god i don't want to fall in the trap of message churches like i see a lot of them they just denominate they only care about themselves they're not interested in outreach or anything like that they just want to make themselves richer all the time they're not even looking for the coming of the lord i showed brother william that quote last week brother mann said if i had 100 million dollars he said i would start a campaign to go around the country to get the bride ready for the rapture he would go out in evangelism if he had 100 million dollars he'd just go from city to city preach in the word let people come let people come get the people ready what gets the people ready feeding on the word get the people ready amen feeding the flock of god will get them ready for the rapture praise god amen i've always said that if i could retire i just want to travel around and preach everywhere trying to go to visit churches try to help them out can i help you out in any way brother you need me to preach of course most preachers won't like that you know but i would hope that somebody could sense the holy spirit on me that i want to do it for the right reasons to point them to the word of god okay so church that was the last word remember the words his last words were it's more blessed to give than receive now let's look how the jew and gentile let's see how they part their ways when he had thus spoken he kneeled down and prayed with them all huh like kneeled down remember i remember i had to kneel on sunday was that sunday morning or sunday night i had all the church kneel down i want to spend sunday morning cause i don't think you're here but you're singing that song about we about we bow down we lay our crowns every knee will about the name of jesus well when they left the last time they got they bowed down and they they got a group hug and cried and wept together read the next one and they all wept sore and fell upon paul's neck and kissed him sorry most of all for the words which he spake that they should see his face no more and they accompanied him under the ship imagine what it's like when the ships roll sailing away hi paul see all the tears rolling down thank you sir for three years of ministry we'll keep preaching the truth paul paul sailed away i imagine his last words preach the word be instant in season out of season rebuking exhorting it with all longsuffering and doctrine for time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine and they're all crying and weeping and praising the lord this jew and gentile used to be enemies but christ's love has united them so much he said i preached so i preached everything everything that i thought would profit you i preached you sometimes past midnight and i've never kept you guys past midnight i don't think i could do it myself actually before i pass out at the pulpit that's not the way i want to pass out but these are his la his last words were more blessed to give be a giver so simple don't be a taker be a giver be like christ be like your heavenly father who sends rain on the just and what would the prophet's last words be to us remember the words of the lord jesus it's more blessed to give than receive so here are the blessings of jew and gentile coming together brothers that hug each other and cries i'm going to miss you brother you weren't there they weren't going to see them again these are real tears brothers that would hug and weep and cry they want to have a hug fest they want to greet one another with a holy kiss so i've visited some churches lately and when i used to go they would kiss me on the neck and everything like that i didn't get that recently and both and some of these churches some of the churches i've visited they the pastors and preachers have told me they're really cold on god how do you know if someone's on fire they love one another they're more interested in giving than receiving i went to the one church recently and a little kid he was his name is derek he come he was the only one nobody else i want come walking the fellowship the only one that coming was this little kid this he's like the amen coroner kid you know he's around him he's like hey brother jesse and he about knocks me over like well thank you buddy thank you for that kind of love everybody else they're just kind of walking by hey brother hey bro they haven't seen me for a year or two hey brother how are you doing sir and they used to come up and kiss me on the neck now see and i was nervous too now i should have kissed them on the neck right i should have with someone full of love right i'm not criticizing other churches but you know what i'm saying we all we all go through seasons like paul said i've been with you in the good seasons i've been with you in the hard seasons but what keeps us together the love of god the love of god so prophet's last word would be that i'm gonna close here it's okay too because i don't uh the time limit's on this anyway like i can't i can't use it because i set a certain time limit he can't use it after a certain time i'm just kind of preaching off my my memory right now but it's going good by god's grace the holy spirit always shows up and helps us out so what would a prophet's last words be feed on the word what's going to keep what's going to keep our church together if we're here we've been here 15 years bang and i my wife only ones left from the beginning we've been here 50 years what has kept us 15 years three services a week most message churches don't do three services a week in america brother it's a lot it's a lot more lacks most churches don't even do two on sunday because they're too tired brother brahms example was two on sunday i'm not criticizing i'm just saying the bible says gather more that you see that day approaching i don't want to get called on god i want to stay hot on fire for god i can't get enough of the word i can't get enough of the worship and the singing i can't get enough of the fellowship now i get tired too just like we get tired right we we all need a nap but i gotta go home eventually eat and get but there's nothing better than being with god's people now we've had different people leave like remember when brother john left i was weeping and crying remember when wendy left i was crying i can relate to that right can you relate to that austin now austin says he's going to come back next next month i think next month or august i don't know if he will church how would we act if he come back we'd all be crying and say praise the lord him and his girlfriend watched our service a couple weeks ago he said oh that was a great sermon you preached on it's a sunday night sir i can't remember what it was oh joshua the walls of jericho he said he said my girlfriend and i we really enjoyed that sermon he still texts me a little sometimes but george this is the love we should have one for another right when we leave each other we should cry right because we're laboring together brother john did so much for me and that man i mean he'd unclog my toilets if they got clogged up that man taught me about finances he made uh computer spreadsheets for me that man fixed them on my vehicle so many times how could i not weep and cry the man prayed for me he preached when i passed out i don't know where you guys were there i passed out one time i tried to i tried to rebuke a a strep throat brother i all night i was up all night rebuking the strep throat help me jesus i want to see angels help me i'm going to preach anyway i go to and i passed out right before the service they had to call 9-1-1 i had to go home that was a couple years ago at the other waterloo so john stepped up and he preached with no uh with no notice just right there to post a duty how can i not love people like that so what would your work last words be don't worry don't worry about taking from people give to people see how much you can give to people remember john wesley said that see how much you can save see how much you can give right that was his wisdom a prophet of god right not a prophet but a messenger of god see what we can give yeah let's say to our feet take heed to one another church take you to our lives make sure we're feeding on the word of god watch and pray know that this word this message is able to build us up think how much stronger brother william is over all these years he's been the message what's in 76 86 96 2006 2016 over 40 years 45 years and i wonder i know if he was if he could look at his life what kind of person was i just 20 years ago i'm a stronger person today because this word of this grace has been able to build me up he might not be bigger physically none of us will be right probably not but he'll be bigger spiritually more faith more confidence more patience in the in the mighty god musicians can come you can stop the live stream here i don't really plan on saying anything else but you can stop it god bless the live streamers
