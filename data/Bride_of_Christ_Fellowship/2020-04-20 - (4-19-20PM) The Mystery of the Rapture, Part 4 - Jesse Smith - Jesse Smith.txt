[Music] god bless everybody it's good to be gathered together here at our house here on the deck in the back just felt like we should get outside today I think we're all tired of being quarantined so

want to love you lord much more than I do I'll learn to seek your face and the knowledge of you grace I want praise God okay well let's take our Bibles here we like to I think the Lord willing we'll finish this little series on the mystery of the rapture so we've done three parts on it this will be part four so let's go to 1st Thessalonians 4:16 and 17 so Lord willing tonight we'll finish up with the rewards for receiving the revelation of the rapture and then the consequences as well I just say this you know with God's grace but you know after Wednesday night service about the rapture and the more we go over these the more it is just more clear to my heart and I trust to yours that this message has the true revelation of the rapture you know acts 3:21 says Jesus remains in heaven until the restitution of all things Matthew 17 11 the Lord Jesus himself says Elias must come and restore all things and if if John the Baptist was that he'd restore the law and so that part wasn't referring to John the Baptist and in the days of the Son of Man there had to be another Son of Man coming and then you know seeing brother Graham's six statements about thus saith the Lord his ministry was the last sign to the Gentiles I think that's makes it very clear for us we can see the scripturally in Genesis chapter 18 as well the last sign God's last visit before the promised son to Abraham and his seed were changing their bodies and then discerning the thoughts and intents of their heart so just getting more clear praise God so 1st Thessalonians 4 16 and 17 I'll read these but then we'll read our memory verses well that God who write those scriptures upon our hearts for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord all rights go to Philippians 4 sorry I'm it's a little cold here as you'll see me blowing on my hands probably well chilly my hands are a little dry as well first sorry Philippians 4 7 & 8 you can hear the birds singing which is really nice clear just saying that song the birds in the sky seen their songs the Lord so we're happy to join them Philippians 4:7 and eight will read our memory verse here let's read that on three one two three and the peace of God which passeth understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things praise God may God's blessings the reading of the word so Lord willing we'll finish here tonight with rapture mystery and I really like this format you know now I can really clearly see why brother Branham would preach the church age series in 1960 before publishing the book in 1965 because revelation comes as you preach it and so I've had numerous cases of that with this in particular this chapter I've seen how God opening it up that it seems like the foolish virgin will not have to suffer and go through the judgments and condemnation of the tribulation now of course it seems like they'll have to die and give their lives but the reason behind that was because a lot lot was spared the suffering or the we'd say the the wrath of God and that was a Bible principle God said I will not let the righteous suffer with the wicked so that's a beautiful promise of God so that's been a further understanding I never really had that understanding until you know starting this series and preaching this I think a few weeks ago by God's grace so we finished Wednesday night with the first reward for receiving this revelation that was the assurance that you're going in the rapture and that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the token praise God and it was foreshadowed in in numerous places but the main - we looked at was Rahab scarlet cord before the destruction of that Gentile city and then the token of the blood of the Lamb that spared Israel and their firstborn before the first Exodus then we know the second Exodus was the disciples on the day of Pentecost leaving man-made religion to hold a ghost full religion and the third Exodus will be the bride of Jesus Christ leaving the spiritual religion in - you might say eternal religion by God's grace that might be it so thank the Lord praise God so let's look at part 4 we read our text out of first Thessalonians 4 16 and 17 so the second reward after the assurance you get in your heart is escaping death and so that was the scripture we read the Bible says those who are alive and remain will not die but will instead have their vile mortal bodies changed into immortal ones remember even believers that die today you know they they have to go through death but remember Paul told us he said death where is your sting so the sting of death is gone but believers who die before the rapture of course have to go through death that that cold door brother random calls it a cold river but there the angels of God just assure your soul into the presence of God because Paul said when I'm absent from the body I'm present with the Lord and so this group who lives to see the rapture and our church is just it's all it's awesome it's humbling to think that most of us weren't raising the message but God seeks us and finds us as little sheep right he leaves a 99 to get the 1 and I didn't grow up knowing anything about a rapture nothing yet we come to this message and the full emphasis is loving Jesus Christ and being ready for the rapture it's quite awesome because we can see how God called us to it God's inviting us to it and we just need to fully surrender to Him and no doubt if we do our part if we yield our freemore agency fully and diligently seek Him then we know God will honor his word you know guy I can't force anybody to go in the rapture but if we her and thirst after it we shall be filled that's clearly taught in the scripture so you know countless funerals have happened down through the six thousand years of human history but there's gonna be a small group of Holy Ghost filled Christians that will not need funeral services so if they had insurance they won't need that they won't need to cash that in families won't need it it's a one-time once in a lifetime once in a church age we'd say once in a Gentile times of the Gentiles opportunity it's a worldwide death pass that God offers believers it's the first and only time a large group of saints will escape death we know two people have Enoch and Elijah such fortunate Saints both escaped death but there will be a larger group now we know to be small compared to the you know the population of the world I think right now we're at 7 billion going to 8 billion this would be a very small number a fraction of a fraction but there will be a small group because Paul said so Jesus promised we know it's going to happen all their saints have had to die but think of it we could be the fortunate blessed privileged generation to see the coming of the Lord and if not us certainly the next generation or the generation after certainly one of the next generations will see it so that's the second reward the first is the assurance you'll get to meet Christ in the air the second is escaping death so let's go to the third the third is experiencing two glorious events in heavenly places while the earth is going through the Great Tribulation Period the first is the meeting in the air and the second is the wedding supper of the Lamb so I'm sure our Bible reader screen readers can get ready here we'll be going through a few so the first one is the meeting in the air that's what Paul said in Philippians we shall meet Christ in the air with the dead in Christ imagine Peter Paul Mary Tabitha brother branham Mita hope sister Mary Sanchez other brother browning brother James browning the saints that have gone on before meeting them in the air after the rapture you know you'll shake hands with these I don't know if we'll shake hands in the air but will instantly recognize them like Martin Luther and John Wesley and st. Paul as we said my soldiers of the cross Timothy all those wonderful Saints but that's not quite the greatest reward of that event the greatest reward will be seeing Jesus face-to-face that will be the greatest event as I wrote this chapter I started tearing up my I started tearing up I realized that was the greatest event of meeting in the air as much as I want to meet you know brother branham and Paul and Peter you know all the saints James you know that gave His life you know for the gospel Steven much as I want to meet warriors like that I think we all want to meet Jesus and he's the worthy one and we all want to see him face to face and that we shall be we shall behold the desire of Nations the bright morning star the fairest of ten thousand the root and offspring of David the Holy One of Israel and the faithful bridegroom the first and the last the Alpha and Omega the beginning in the end what a blessing it's at that moment the Bible says we no longer see through a glass darkly but that's when we'll see him face to face when I'll be our first scripture Lydia can you read 1st Corinthians 13:12 and Malachi can you get Philippians 3:21 so I'll say that again 1st Corinthians 13:12 for Lydia and Philippians 3:21 for Malachi so Lydia Glen so Paul you know of course he's laying out the gifts of the Spirit and the Corinthians Church but then by God's grace he breaks into this thought where these are all these gifts the Holy Spirit are tremendous blessings there helps there's such an encouragement but they're all partial blessings and but Paul says even with the gifts of the Spirit you know we things are really dark you know it's fuzzy because we're human and our minds wander our minds get discouraged we forget get discouraged at times but Paul says when when he sees Christ face-to-face he will not see through a glass darkly but I'll see Christ face-to-face and not only will we see him face to face but he'll change our bodies as we mentioned on Wednesday Abraham and Sarah had a body change and so Jesus would do the same thing for Abraham and Sarah's spiritual seed Malachi can read that please you sometimes wonder how is God gonna you know change our bodies well the Bible says right there he can subdue anything if he can calm the storms if he can walk on water if he can come down from heaven and meet Abraham and just you know pull dust upon him and make him a flesh body well then surely he can change our bodies if he placed all the stars in the skies we've seen that song and they never missed their timing then surely he can change our bodies in the moment and the twinkling of an eye because he has no limits he's unlimited he's omnipotent all-powerful almighty so we know we'll see him face to face that will be the moment we see him face to face praise God and we'll have change bodies like it under his glorious body so this is where we sing that song I believe it's it as well with my soul where Lord hates the day when my faith shall be sight and so this is the moment when our faith becomes sight I guess you might even say Lord willing if we get to see the Saints before the rapture if we get to see the dead in Christ rise first then truly our face will come sight at that moment see such supernatural miracles would make our faith present right it's all it's obviously a substance inside of us but when we see people there well if we see saints dead in Christ risen first and our faith truly has become sight the reality of our faith would be standing before us and when we meet Christ in the air the no doubt our faith becomes sight that moment so no longer will we be able to say Peters words in first Peter 1:8 miss Peter says having not seen you love so once we get to the meeting in the air that wonderful reward we'll be able to say I have seen the Lord and I love him even more because we have perfect bodies perfect minds right no longer and the ability to sin by the grace of the Lord so Peter said having not seen you love but there having seen we love even more praise God so there's not a lot of questions on our minds about the meeting in the air of the rapture it's the catching of the way our catching away of the bride of Jesus Christ to meet the Lord in the air now the second event is the wedding supper of the Lamb now this one seems at this moment we have less details about this event but we are given a couple important scriptures and perhaps shirts you know as the Lord tarries you know the Lord will open up more revelation you know regarding these events for example I can see in the church age book where brother man talks about will read it now so Lydia can you get 2nd Corinthians 11:2 so Paul taught our brother man talks about the church age messenger from each church age presenting his group of believers from his age presenting them spotless presenting the bride to the husband and from what I've listened to I haven't heard brother Ram labor on that thought it seems like it's a revelation that God gave him as he wrote he and lavell worked on writing the church age book that's an example of at the end of brother Rams ministry God gives him even fresh even more fresh revelation about the rapture we know the shout voice Trump in December of 1965 was fresh revelation or the Branham had never preached it that way at least that I've heard so the Holy Spirit keeps guiding us into all truth well we should expect that then the Holy Spirit will reveal more about these future events the meeting in the air and then also here the wedding supper of the Lamb so the first the first event of the wedding supper at least from my understanding seems to be the presentation of the bride to the bridegroom Jesus Christ I just I just remember that scripture the first shall be last and the last shall be first so that may tie in here I'm not certain but it may tie in here if the first goes last that would mean the first church age would be last in order and then the last church age would be presented first so that's just one thought I'm not certain on that but that's just something that I thought was interesting about the scripture because a member Jesus quotes that after the parables where he's talking about the wedding and his coming about the rapture so that's just an interesting scripture to keep in mind by the grace of the Lord so that he can read that second Corinthians 11:2 for I am jealous over you with godly dossier I despised you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ good now the Corinthian church was birthed under Paul's preaching in acts 18 1 to 17 and then Paul says I've already espoused you two to Christ so he that means he engaged them so it seems like the messenger from each age presents Jesus Christ in such a way where the people want to merit want to accept his marriage proposal and so because the messenger is the one who presents the bridegroom to the bride Paul says I have espoused you and another way to look at it as Paul said you have many teachers in the Lord but not many fathers so it seemed like the church age messenger could be like a father figure right and then the Saints or his converts could be like the daughter because that that seems to fit the symbolism God is giving here of kinda like Eleazar you know presenting the bride to Isaac kind of get that same type of symbolism here so Paul says he has his duty since he's espoused them he said that I may present you so he does he's desiring to do it and it would seem like the logical time to do this would be at the wedding supper because no doubt on earth you know after Paul left the city of Corinth numerous Saints as time went on would just die and pass on and so Paul didn't physically present them to Christ during their lifetime we'd say but he says that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ so again that's a great scripture for being a virgin to Christ meaning no interaction no idols no intercourse with the things of the world you know money and idolatry and spiritual fornication worship of idols so that's a great scripture there you can tie in together so all this tell the Corinthian church who heard Paul's preaching about the baptism the Holy Ghost they'll be resurrected resurrected rather for the rapture and gathered there in heaven for the wedding supper and it seems like that's where Paul will present his church age to Jesus Christ and that's where we believe brother Branham will present our church age including us to Christ Jesus now another thing another part of this would be the awards or the rewards for the Saints Paul said that the Saints every one must appear before the judgment seat of Christ and brother Branham had a dream about this where he was called up after Ormond Neville he was caught up to the throne of God to get his rewards and the stand before the throne of God and he said when he got up to the steps he said he said he felt something touch his hand that was hope and then he was really happy and then he's felt something touched his other hand and that was meda and he said both of his wives played such a role that they would stand before the throne of God together for rewards he said I hope it's that way and that's what we hope - we hope that that dream was a scriptural dream it seems to be because Paul says in first Corinthians 3 that we must all stand before the judgment seat of Christ then Peter says husbands and wives are heirs together or inheritors together of the grace of life so that's another aspect another reward the meeting in the air the awards rewards and then the the presentation and then there's one more the communion service followed by yeah which would be an eating service as well as a member before Jesus was crucified the Bible said he desired to have communion or the lat are the Lord's Supper the Passover with his disciples he desired with desire and then once we get to the marriage supper he wants to have communion with his entire bride praise God so he had it there with his apostles but then after the rapture he'll have it with his entire bride for sure so on earth Jesus's last communion signaled the end of their earthly communion but when Jesus has communion heaviness signals the beginning of the eternal communion praise God so we can see the Jesus ends his communion with communion and then he restarts the communion I'm sorry the fellowship with communion which is a beautiful thing to see we're not going to read it but in Genesis 14 remember Melchizedek has communion with Abram after gaining the victory and so that's why we can see that communion service with bread and wine we can see that as a meal between Abraham and Melchizedek then we can see that that's what the bride of Jesus Christ and Christ will experience together a communion in heaven by God's grace after the trials of life are over you know we suffer like we said over the Easter weekend we have sufferings persecutions but Paul says they're light afflictions and but if we're faithful and we keep the faith we keep his word of patience to the end he'll keep us from the hour temptation that he will serve us Communion at that great event the heavenly communion the marriage supper the lamb remember Abraham defeated four kings in Genesis 14 he took his trained army and restored lot and in fact all the people and goods of sodom and gomorrah and that was prophetic or that was a type of the saints a day defeating the four horse riders because we know the fourth horse rider we know his name is death and he was just a combination of the previous three riders because it's the same rider all the way down so just as abraham defeated four kings will defeat those same four temptations from the same the one the same antichrist spirit so the white was deception remember the black which are the red was death so their their ability to control church and state and then black that was famine and the Dark Ages capturing the wealth of the world so all those are the components of spiritual death and we defeat all those by the grace of God even death especially death at the rapture right because we escaped death it's a praise God and then Christ of course he keeps the promise he made to his disciples in Matthew 26 29 he said but I say unto you I will not drink henceforth of the fruit of this vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my father's Kingdom think of that 2000 years Jesus has got that promise he hasn't drank of the fruit of vine somehow in heaven there's gonna be the fruit of the vine up in heaven and he can have communion with the Saints again okay the fourth reward here is raptured Saints get to experience the 1000 year millennial reign with Christ this is the honeymoon for Christ and his bride as the rapture is the wedding ceremony right now is the engagement so thankful to be engaged to Christ praise God I know he's coming for me he's giving me the the wedding band of predestinated unmerited grace right I made my vows to him he made his vows to us for his word and we know God keeps his word so we are married to the Lord engaged to him praise God and we'll be married physically face-to-face at the rapture so this is a single day of the Lord because the day of the Lord is as a thousand years with man that's according to 2nd Peter 3:8 and there's no sin in this day oh what a glorious day this is the day we long for [Music] just imagine I just imagine a thousand years no aches pains sicknesses no coronavirus no death no destruction there'll be no abuse no cursing no wickedness no selfishness no the will be the kingdom of God on earth fully the full government of Jesus Christ with a rod of iron ruling over the nation's now we're not going to read through all this just for times sake how we doing on time looking but revelation 20 verses 4 and 6 says I saw Thrones and they that sat upon them so they it's a group of people sitting on Thrones judgment was given unto them the souls of those that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the word of God which had not worshipped the Beast neither His image neither received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands army they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years we just don't live we reign we rule in that Kingdom but the rest of the Dead lived not for a thousand years and this is called the first resurrection and again it says they shall reign with him a thousand years church that's all this life is this life is a testing time to see who wants to reign who if we let Christ reign in our life now then Christ will he can trust us to reign in his kingdom later praise god we've got to let Christ reign over our freemore agency now because it's the only hope for our lives our lives will be wasted our lives will be sad and despair if we don't let Jesus Christ have control of our freemore agency because we know he has the best design for our life he has the best plan for our lives he can his highest thoughts are way higher than our thoughts as that sky is higher than all of us right so are the Lord's plans for our lives way higher than our thoughts [Music] now remember the rest of the Dead lived not 2000 years so the foolish virgin will not live during this time it's because they were warned to get the oil but they neglected it Hebrews 2 verses 3 and 4 says we must not neglect such a powerful Holy Ghost gospel with signs wonders and miracles and then of course millions billions of unbelievers will miss the rapture I'm sorry I missed the thousand your lynnium just because of their unbelief so imagine this a thousand years no devil no temptation no lusts no greed no murder no destruction and thankfully no politics right Christ will be king King of Kings Lord of lords for 300,000 sixty-five days in a row pure peace joy great victory beauty joy joy out of me joy unspeakable full of glory some Christians were even rule over nations lydia revelation 2:26 mecca luke 1917 some christians will rule over nations and some christians will have authority over ten cities these are the words of the lord jesus we looked at these last year I think when we looked at diligence and rewards for those who are diligent for the kingdom of God so Lydia Luke - I'm sorry revelation 2:26 [Music] that was spoken in the Sardis church age Martin Luther's church age the overcomers that came out of the Catholic denomination Anglican denomination all the all the denominations of men and were born again jesus promises them ruling over nations now Kyle Luke 1917 so this is the man who was given five talents and he doubles it and so God says I'm gonna make you ruler you said you have ten talents I'm gonna make you ruler over ten cities the church we need to look at that right we can look at our church as a little city right and if we can be faithful over one little Church we can be faithful look at your house look at your job this is just one little city one little town look at something very small if I can just rule over this and let the Holy Spirit have preeminence in every part of this administration of this little government you know God's made your little governor right you know we thank God for the Governor of Ohio and all the godly governors you know in America and around the world but we have to realize we're governors I'm a governor of my home I'm a governor of my my my job I'm a governor of the church and if I can rule over this well and if I can keep investing in it until more and more spiritual fruits and hopefully natural fruits of souls being saved and testimonies coming out of the Word of God being preached then then we believe God will make us ruler over Moore later he said if you're faithful with a little you'll be faithful with a lot so let's be faithful now by God's grace so if you can submit everything to Christ and be a cross carrier in this life can you handle the the weight of the Cross way to the cross and follow Jesus in this lifetime let's not throw off the cross what's the cross it's your burden it's something God is placed on your life that's it's challenging but God has called you to it maybe it's a gift of the Holy Spirit of you as we preached on if it's a ministry its ministering your family that's a lot of people's cross many times maybe it's ministering other ways with gifts and ministries helping this the poor clothing that those that don't have much clothes there's many many kinds of ministries you can have remember the women that they just went around I can't remember the name of it Susanna all the women that followed Jesus's ministry and they just donated their money you know to help out the brothers as they preach God's Word and no doubt God will bless the faithful sisters in our church and brothers that maybe not preachers but if they're providing for the preachers and the guest ministers and helping we take the ties and send them to missionaries and do all that and I believe God will honor you and bless you and I'll see your your investments in his kingdom for those things jesus said he that's faithful in the least is faithful also in much according to Luke 16:10 a Christian who's faithful over a few things will be ruler over many things in Matthew 25:21 remember this quote from brother Branham he said if you keep doing works faithfully until the end you'll be given power over the nation's he said you'll be a strong capable unbending ruler who can cope so powerfully with any situation that's we want to be in this hour and I think of and hooah you know they have a difficult situation but they gotta cope with that and they gotta let the Holy Spirit continue to love and believe and pray through that and not let their emotion or the discouragement or the difficulty of that situation overcome them and get them in the flesh they need to bring that bring those bring those tests under control of the power of the Holy Spirit just as all of us go through different tests in our lives and different ones get sick or losing jobs or difficult things happen to us we have to be able to cope with every situation and in the middle the difficult situation give God praise and don't give the flesh an opportunity to sin so praise God that is the conclusion of the rewards so I got one one and a half more pages here I'm at 46 minutes so praise the Lord so there's there's one main consequence for rejecting this revelation and that's being unprepared so Lydia Malachi can you get Luke 12 both you go to Luke 12 if you can't I [Music] think it's a little chillier than we thought out here try to finish up by God's grace so the first consequence is being unprepared or foolish or slothful is another word for it so Lydia can you read 45 and 46 Luke 12 I'm sorry Luke 12 45 and 46 you read 47 a sobering scripture we're in the message and we know that the Lord is coming soon so it's important for us that have heard to be faithful be diligent because this parable gives a great picture of it if we're faithful we will honor the in our care so in this in this parable the man had done faithfully served his people their meat in due season and he had to be sober and he had to do the Lord's will but if he was slothful he would give them you wouldn't feed them their meat in due season you give them something out of season wouldn't be wouldn't be what they needed for that hour he'd get drunk and he wouldn't be alert and watching and he wouldn't do he wouldn't do Christ's will he would do his own will so especially me as a minister I got to be very careful to give you the God's meat in his season I've got to keep a sober mind serious mind I got to do God's will and not my will so see the shout has gone forth in this parable they knew the Lord was going to return that's what Brella ram's message does it prepares us for the coming of the Lord but most people will be overtaken the Bible says but Paul says don't let these things slip in Hebrews 2:1 church we don't want to let something slip out of our hands you know I've I have numerous children and each one when I'm putting them down for the nap the little ones not the big ones with the little ones if they're holding on to something that slips out of their hand right and so that's the picture Paul's giving this this this man this leader he's sleeping he's drunk and these things slip out of his hand these opportunities are right in his hand if they slip right out of it the message is right in our hands the revelation of God's Word this Bible is right in our hands we have the keys to unlock we have the revelations to unlock the mystery of God we can't let these slip out of our hands we got to give ourselves more diligently to the word of the Lord and give ourselves wholly to the doctrine of God I'm committed to that I want to meditate upon these things because you are what you eat and I want to eat God's Word so foolish is the only word that God can give to the people that reader that that reject the rapture that don't prepare themselves for his coming because member Church this was hid from ages and from generations in Colossians chapter 1 Christ in you the hope of glory this Holy Ghost baptism was hidden for four thousand years but in these last two thousand years it's been made available we must take advantage we must drink of the living water we must know what it feels like to have waters of praise as waters of Thanksgiving to flow out of our hearts like a like a river praise God amen thank God just to praise his name and to worship and love him it's like living waters springing up in your soul those the those who reject the revelation but die before the rapture they of course they're absent from the learned they don't rise with the dead in Christ they miss the marriage supper and most likely the Millennium but the foolish virgin that live long enough to miss the rapture and be alive during the tribulation they'll have to die during the tribulation I don't believe that they'll have to suffer the vials or the trumpets or the hail fire brimstone I believe that's reserved for those who took the mark of the beast just like lot how lot was spared from the fiery destruction and judgment that came upon Sodom and Gomorrah remember God will not suffer the righteous to die like the wicked but one thing we know that will happen Jesus tells us this in Matthew 25 11 12 and 13 the foolish version will come and knock so they'll have some type of prayer meeting and say Lord let us in Oh God let them take us us take us in the rapture as well and Jesus will say verily I say unto you I know you not I want Christ to know me now I want I'm gonna lay my heart open don't you I lay my heart open now so Christ knows me now because he's gonna tell the foolish virgin I don't know you but I want Christ to search every door my heart I'm opening my door say Jesus come in and sup with me praise God and while you're here clean everything out purify my heart my mind my soul I just want to obey your word and do all of your will and not my will yes those dumb believers will suffer the sudden destruction Paul said in first Thessalonians 5 it'll be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time that's a corn first thessalonians 5:3 in daniel 12:1 so in conclusion I just have these last few words I want to say that's the conclusion you and I know the revelation of the rapture it is a sudden secret snatching away of Christ taking his bride off the earth before God's judgments of wrath or poured a pop poured out upon this wicked generation [Music] that is the revelation through a shout voice Trump through the power of the Holy Spirit the same spirit that quickened Jesus body will quicken our mortal bodies amen it'll swallow up our bodies of death in life and transform us in a moment the twinkling of an eye six reasons prove that it's a pre-tribulation rapture so we must stay awake alert daily wearing the armor of God and utilizing the sword of the Spirit when we must fight against the enemy by God's amazing grace we'll accept his invitation we'll be prepared for this once in history event a large group of privileged Christians will escape death as Jesus changes their bodies in a moment of a twink of an eye that will see Jesus face to face and so shall we ever be with the Lord what a beautiful revelation remember 2,000 years ago in Revelation 10 7 the Bible said that mystery of God would be finished and taken around the world and we're fortunate to know the mystery of God now it's our responsibility to echo it to our friends our neighbors those on line who will be able to receive it and church I'll say like this we can say referring to revelation 10 7 to 11 the day this scripture is fulfilled the mystery of God is finished and now as we take it around the world and we send brothers to do it and you know using the the tool of YouTube or the internet we can say this day the scripture is being fulfilled here the mystery of God is being echoed and the prophecies of God gave brother Paul brother Peter brother John and brother
