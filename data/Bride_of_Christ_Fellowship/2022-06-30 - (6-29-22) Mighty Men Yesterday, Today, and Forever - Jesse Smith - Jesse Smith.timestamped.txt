[3:58] lord we just want to be muted to your
[3:59] holy spirit that something mighty can be
[4:02] accomplished in our lives lord god that
[4:04] would be not what would be mighty to the
[4:06] world but what would be mighty in the

[4:11] come reverently also god we just ask you
[4:13] god for this scrolls family god please

[4:21] anymore so father be merciful
[4:23] lord jesus and i just pray lord
[4:25] you comfort everyone in that area lord
[4:27] god no doubt the enemy

[4:34] father i pray god just give
[4:36] those families peace that passes all
[4:38] understanding i wouldn't know what else
[4:40] to say lord other than that other than
[4:41] the scripture says those that are

[4:45] comfort them give them peace oh god give
[4:47] them hope for heaven lord god
[4:50] lord just in your mercy let your
[4:52] presence be so strong there to give them
[4:53] love and

[4:59] father we just ask god that our love
[5:01] would be shared with them as well
[5:02] through the holy spirit dear god we
[5:04] thank you for tonight bless this word
[5:06] father we're here to receive from you
[5:08] help me lord god help each and every one
[5:09] in jesus christ's name
[5:12] god bless you
[5:15] if you can switch over i got something
[5:20] here
[5:24] i don't know if i've ever preached on
[5:25] this specific thought or not but after
[5:28] watching all their watching david and
[5:29] then
[5:30] hearing the preaching of things
[5:32] we got we basically got david playing 24
[5:35] 7 at our house
[5:36] after just hearing about the 400 time i
[5:39] i uh i listen to that song about the
[5:41] mighty men and i thought that is right
[5:43] that's scripture that he was quoting
[5:45] scripture
[5:46] and so i want to praise a few sermons on
[5:48] this of course this picture is the three
[5:50] mighty men uh the mightiest of the three
[5:54] there was at least 37 total mighty men
[5:57] as we'll see in a little bit here but
[5:59] these are the three mightiest that broke
[6:00] through the philistine lines god gave
[6:03] david a drink of water yeah so uh the
[6:06] three mightiest here uh you have a dino
[6:09] or dino uh eliezer and shema
[6:13] so
[6:14] three mighty men but uh for me i'm
[6:16] looking at if they had mighty men in
[6:17] that day
[6:19] uh they had mighty men before that
[6:22] they had mighty men in the book of acts
[6:23] yeah that means there's mighty men
[6:25] yesterday today and forever yeah praise
[6:28] god hallelujah may god help us to be
[6:30] mighty for his glory
[6:32] the mighty power of god amen so
[6:34] i'm going to skip past those are my
[6:35] notes here so my purpose is basically to
[6:37] increase our faith in god
[6:39] so he can work mightily in our lives
[6:42] in the last few weeks i've been doing a
[6:43] lot of teaching right a lot of teaching
[6:45] teaching about interracial marriage and
[6:46] what the bible says about that and
[6:48] different other topics a little slower
[6:51] you know more sermons where you have to
[6:52] think about it a lot you know and this
[6:54] one hopefully you don't have to think
[6:55] too hard on this one
[6:57] god wants to move mightily through your
[6:58] life amen hallelujah
[7:01] god wants to move mightily in my life
[7:03] your life great lord jesus amen
[7:06] but what we need we need to increase the
[7:07] amount of faith praise god yeah we need
[7:09] a consecrated walk because brother man
[7:11] says the moving of the holy spirit only
[7:13] comes to a life that's consecrated to
[7:16] the word of god that's right so we don't
[7:17] see the spirit of god constantly moving
[7:19] through our lives it's because we're not
[7:21] cut or constantly moving through our
[7:22] lives it's because we're not consecrated
[7:24] to the holy spirit we've led up on our
[7:26] prayer life or we let up on our bible
[7:29] reading or our obedience right or let a
[7:31] complex come in when we don't see the
[7:33] spirit of god moving in our life we've
[7:35] let up on something
[7:37] amen and i'm not talking about you know
[7:38] the dead rising and
[7:40] and paralyzed people walking i'm not
[7:41] talking about that those are those are
[7:43] maybe once in a generation kind of
[7:45] things
[7:45] at least from what i at least from the
[7:47] message people i know
[7:49] right i know very few that i've seen the
[7:51] dead rays very few that have seen
[7:52] paralyzed people walk those are amazing
[7:54] things amen i believe it yeah my dad
[7:57] amen praise god resurrected hallelujah
[8:00] yeah brother craig seen it uh when they
[8:02] had a car accident outside the church
[8:03] but with brother brooks there that man
[8:05] was raised from the dead
[8:07] it's like a couple time in a generation
[8:09] kind of thing that's mighty works of god
[8:12] but what i'm saying is also saying is
[8:13] that you have a work to do from god and
[8:16] it's going to take god's strength to do
[8:18] it you cannot do it without his strength
[8:20] and the fact when his strength comes
[8:22] that will make you mighty that's right
[8:24] because you won't be able to do it on
[8:25] your own you and i can do nothing on our
[8:27] own
[8:28] that's right what we need is more faith
[8:30] amen
[8:31] or what we need is our face stirred up
[8:33] hallelujah yeah that's it stir it up
[8:34] amen mixed up active praise god
[8:37] uh the actual word there means a boiling
[8:39] we need our mind boiling with the word
[8:41] of god
[8:42] we don't need our mind yeah we don't
[8:44] need our mind freezing with all the
[8:45] problems in the world
[8:47] right that'll freeze you up that's what
[8:48] fear does it freezes you up it paralyzes
[8:50] you right
[8:51] and we pay too much attention to the
[8:53] world or our problems that freezes that
[8:55] hinders that cools down our minds but we
[8:57] need the word of god in our minds that
[8:59] it stirs us up makes us ready and active
[9:02] moving amen he can be moved by the holy
[9:04] spirit praise god amen
[9:06] i've done a lot of teachings i i
[9:08] realized that church and perry green i
[9:10] was reading about perry green today uh
[9:12] or the other day rather he knew he
[9:14] wasn't a teacher
[9:16] he knew that right he knew he didn't
[9:18] have a teaching gift he says it himself
[9:20] he said he just had a preaching gift and
[9:22] his main job was to witness about
[9:23] brother branham that his main ministry
[9:26] was the witness about brother branham
[9:27] well i know i i never met brother brown
[9:29] so i don't have that witnessing that's
[9:30] not my ministry i've got a teaching
[9:32] ministry right
[9:34] right i have people all around the world
[9:35] taught me that all around the world i
[9:37] have to ask them they tell me i don't
[9:38] even ask for compliments they just tell
[9:40] me
[9:41] it's god vindicating it praise god yeah
[9:43] but then at the same time i know i don't
[9:45] want to do too much teaching i like to
[9:46] balance it out with some more preaching
[9:48] so i want to preach to you tonight that
[9:50] god wants to do something mighty in your
[9:52] life amen
[9:53] hallelujah and like my man said god
[9:55] might god might uh like john the baptist
[9:58] god might train you for 30 years for six
[10:00] months
[10:01] of mighty ministry praise god amen but
[10:03] that's what i'm telling you god wants to
[10:05] use you and i in a mighty way yes he
[10:07] does amen
[10:08] hallelujah
[10:10] bless the lord and so if there was
[10:12] mighty men in david's day there's got to
[10:14] be some mighty men here today praise god
[10:16] and i mean women too sister so sisters
[10:18] this is this sermon don't yeah don't go
[10:19] to sleep on this sermon amen now the
[10:22] next one i'm gonna the next sermon
[10:23] though on this one lord willing i'm
[10:24] gonna show you a real a powerful sister
[10:26] here but i'm not gonna get that one
[10:28] there's a lot of them
[10:30] there's a lot of mighty men too there's
[10:31] a lot of mighty sisters yeah but god is
[10:33] always looking
[10:35] always
[10:37] looking for someone to show his mighty
[10:39] power inside of their life praise god
[10:43] god is constantly running around the
[10:44] world with his eyes about the eyes of
[10:46] the lord
[10:48] that's his eyes running right eyes ready
[10:50] that's what god's eyes are doing amen in
[10:52] other words he's constantly going from
[10:54] house to house he's going from prayer
[10:55] closet to prayer closet trying to find
[10:57] somebody that wants to be strong amen
[11:00] let's be strong in the spirit and not
[11:02] the flesh amen that's right hallelujah
[11:05] but in order for that to happen you've
[11:06] got to starve the flesh
[11:09] or you've got to deny the flesh amen
[11:11] shall not deny the flesh in order for
[11:12] the spirit of god to use you amen that's
[11:15] true hallelujah
[11:17] bless god you know asa asa had many
[11:20] victories but then uh in this particular
[11:22] chapter he goes out and gets help from
[11:24] heath and kings
[11:27] and uh the bible said we're not the
[11:28] ethiopians and the living's a great host
[11:30] with very many chariots and horsemen yet
[11:33] because thou didst rely on the lord he
[11:35] delivered them into your hand
[11:37] so god is rebuking the king asa
[11:39] he said because the eyes of the lord run
[11:41] to and fro from throughout the whole
[11:43] earth to show himself strong
[11:47] in the behalf of them whose heart is
[11:50] perfect toward us so church a perfect
[11:52] heart is a heart that relies on god amen
[11:56] glory hallelujah that's it
[11:58] a perfect heart relies on god what for
[12:01] your your your spiritual your spiritual
[12:03] state your natural state yeah everything
[12:06] every need you have a perfect heart
[12:08] relies on god god's wrath amen
[12:11] this ain't teaching i'm preaching to the
[12:13] church
[12:14] trying to preach and build your faith
[12:15] amen hallelujah praise god i gotta rely
[12:18] on god for my healing what do you got to
[12:19] rely on god for
[12:21] every air of our life when we rely on
[12:23] god that's that's giving god a chance to
[12:25] be strong in our lives amen amen amen
[12:28] well many times church we're tempted to
[12:30] show how strong we think we are
[12:33] when we have very little strength really
[12:36] oh yeah compared to that god of the god
[12:38] of the universe where we showed that a
[12:39] few weeks ago
[12:40] the god of the universe amen he's the
[12:42] one with strength he's the mighty one
[12:44] amen
[12:45] the mighty one of israel hollywood the
[12:47] infinite one the all-powerful one the
[12:49] masters one the eternal one who would
[12:52] have its eternity hallelujah
[12:57] he's looking for someone that he can
[12:59] show strength in
[13:00] he wants to be strong in teenagers
[13:03] yes he can he wants to be strong in
[13:05] elementary student amen
[13:08] he must be strong in preachers
[13:11] he wants to be stronger than the mothers
[13:13] yeah
[13:14] he must be strong in the papas and the
[13:16] granddaddies
[13:18] he wants to be strong in the singles
[13:20] amen
[13:21] and they're married amen he wants to be
[13:23] strong and all of us say man
[13:26] but ace had done foolishly
[13:28] because he had trusted in man to win the
[13:31] battles rather than god
[13:34] you're going to see this in a little bit
[13:35] you know but i'll just
[13:37] actually i'm going to fast forward this
[13:39] at the end of david's life he got in
[13:41] trouble because he numbered his men
[13:42] remember that yes
[13:44] why
[13:45] the bible said
[13:47] into great sin because he wanted a
[13:49] number that he could trust him
[13:51] and the whole time church every battle
[13:53] he fought he always won
[13:55] not relying on numbers that's right true
[13:58] in fact he never had a battle where they
[14:00] outnumbered the enemy amen
[14:03] in other words the devil always
[14:04] outnumbered him but god always prevails
[14:08] amen but at the end of his life he wants
[14:11] to know the number and god has to rebuke
[14:13] him for that they lost what how many i
[14:15] think 70 000 in the three days of plague
[14:18] see that's proving to us we cannot rely
[14:20] on our bank accounts we cannot rely upon
[14:23] our houses we cannot rely upon our
[14:26] employers we've got to rely upon jehovah
[14:29] god the self-existing one amen amen
[14:33] praise god because god was upset when
[14:35] david did that
[14:37] he relied on his number of men rather
[14:39] than uh the number of angels that were
[14:41] in god's campaign
[14:44] amen
[14:45] a mighty man or woman let's keep saying
[14:48] that a mighty sister relies on god
[14:52] amen
[14:54] how do you believe that amen
[14:56] and god is constantly looking every day
[14:59] every nation
[15:01] you know america is an awful nation but
[15:03] there is faith so in america
[15:05] the church said
[15:06] there's faith in me praise god i might
[15:08] not manifest as much as i want but i've
[15:10] got faith hallelujah sure man sure i
[15:14] want god to find me in the morning on my
[15:16] knees i want god to find me
[15:18] in a service where i'm here to god where
[15:21] god can do something strong for his
[15:23] glory praise god
[15:24] because god don't do it except through
[15:26] man the bible that's what brother m says
[15:27] right we know that
[15:28] right bible says in scripture i'm not
[15:30] just saying because i said in mark 16
[15:33] mark 16 the bible says yeah the lord
[15:35] worked with them amen vindicating the
[15:38] word with signs and wonders following
[15:40] praise god yeah
[15:42] the bible says we are ambassadors unto
[15:44] god in other words god sent ambassadors
[15:46] from the heavenly nation down to earth
[15:49] to testify to be as witnesses to do his
[15:52] business on the earth amen amen lord
[15:54] glory to his name see we're strong in
[15:57] mighty church when we rely on god
[16:01] amen i was praying last week we had
[16:03] numerous financial needs in our church i
[16:05] was praying god please send us a
[16:06] financial blessing guess how much money
[16:08] came in the mail this week
[16:09] four thousand five hundred dollars wow
[16:12] and i didn't ask anybody for nothing
[16:14] i just asked god
[16:17] and it's about all used up now that's
[16:19] kind of how it is right
[16:21] god said god sends it so you you meet
[16:24] the need praise god
[16:26] god sends it for that purpose amen so
[16:28] you can go help somebody else amen
[16:31] it's not for me it's for other people
[16:34] amen see
[16:37] when we rely on god
[16:39] then god shows himself mighty in our
[16:41] lives amen
[16:43] now it's difficult like what i said you
[16:45] got this you got to deny the five senses
[16:47] live by the sixth sense that's it amen
[16:49] ignore those try to ignore those five
[16:51] the best you can but we have to go to
[16:52] the doctor first right that's good but
[16:54] then live off the sixth sense
[16:57] trust god amen
[17:00] he's more than able to do exceedingly
[17:02] abundantly above all we ask or faith
[17:07] [Applause]
[17:08] it's able yes we have to look at the
[17:10] doctors and to look at the numbers we
[17:12] have to look at all these things the
[17:13] facts look at the symptoms but we have
[17:15] an awesome look at the eternal the
[17:17] heavenly symptoms they've had the
[17:18] heavenly answer the heavenly remedy amen
[17:21] we've gotta look to god we must rely on
[17:23] the holy spirit praise god yeah amen
[17:26] amen
[17:28] i just want to take a brief look so this
[17:29] is where our lord willing i'll spend
[17:31] more time in the new testament next week
[17:33] okay well lord willingly maybe someday
[17:35] we'll kind of see how the lord moves
[17:36] there
[17:37] by god's grace
[17:39] but let's take a brief look at how is
[17:41] the new testament persons mighty well
[17:43] the bible said the apostles were mighty
[17:46] the early apostles that were sat under
[17:48] jesus or paul who learned from jesus by
[17:51] vision the bible said they were given uh
[17:54] signs wonders and mighty deeds now
[17:57] mighty is the word dunamis yes right
[17:59] that's the same word that fell the holy
[18:01] ghost fell on the day of pentecost right
[18:03] same word right the spirit of god they
[18:05] were all filled with the holy spirit the
[18:07] dutiness of the holy spirit
[18:09] amen they were filled with the dunamis
[18:12] amen and that means strength or power or
[18:15] ability now it's true nobody can do a
[18:18] miracle greater than jesus
[18:20] i'm going to repeat this again for our
[18:22] live streaming audience and for our
[18:23] church because we've had different
[18:25] people coming over the years and they
[18:26] say well jesus said greater works than
[18:28] these will you do that does not mean
[18:30] you'll do greater than jesus
[18:32] right right if it does then first go
[18:35] walk on water first just do as good as
[18:37] jesus first
[18:38] and then i'll believe that you can do
[18:39] greater
[18:40] yeah while you're at it go get some mud
[18:43] spin on it put somebody's eyes all right
[18:45] i put eyeballs where there are no
[18:46] eyeballs all right
[18:48] then i'll start believing your
[18:49] interpretation of that verse
[18:51] but the people that usually say that
[18:52] don't have mighty works no
[18:54] they've got some false vendetta they're
[18:56] trying to lift people up in a vain kind
[18:58] of way
[18:59] nobody could do greater than the son of
[19:00] god amen
[19:02] that's why he receives all the glory all
[19:03] the power all the praise all the might
[19:05] all the majesty amen the bible says the
[19:08] fullness of the godhead dwells in him he
[19:10] said all power is given to me in heaven
[19:13] earth and we have a measure but jesus
[19:15] christ had all power amen amen
[19:18] that's why i had such mighty deeds glory
[19:20] hallelujah
[19:21] so we'll never do greater than jesus but
[19:24] we can do mighty deeds and i just
[19:26] believe this the apostles had greater
[19:28] deeds than everybody else because they
[19:30] were the first ones sent
[19:33] now of course the bible says there are
[19:35] some of us who have the word the gifts
[19:37] of miracles right right
[19:40] now and then paul gives the order he
[19:42] says apostles prophets teachers and then
[19:45] he says miracles so now what now this is
[19:48] the right order but look what if you're
[19:49] an apostle and you have miracles now
[19:51] you're not you're gifted in numerous
[19:52] ways
[19:54] now you're double gifted triple gifted
[19:56] four gifts five gifts six the wrath said
[19:58] martin luther had nine gifts all nine
[20:00] gifts and that was just the gift what
[20:02] about the preaching gifts
[20:04] so he had over 10 gifts
[20:06] and the church said
[20:09] i mean you could have multiple gifts
[20:11] and if god gave you a gift that means
[20:13] god wants to use it that's right yeah if
[20:15] god the word gift means uh charisma if
[20:18] i'm not mistaken
[20:20] it's a it's a it's an unmerited gift
[20:23] it's it's power praise god god gave us
[20:25] some power but we got to be healed to
[20:27] the holy spirit so god can use his power
[20:31] amen
[20:32] now of course we know not everybody will
[20:34] have miracles no right we're thankful
[20:36] when we see miracles right
[20:38] uh but not all will have miracles so in
[20:40] other words god can show power and might
[20:43] in our lives in different ways
[20:45] sure sure but we should still all strive
[20:48] glory we should all live that people
[20:51] would see the mighty power of god in our
[20:53] lives hallelujah amen amen i believe
[20:55] that amen amen we should live for that i
[20:58] believe because god's eyes are looking
[21:00] for that
[21:01] yes he is he's looking for someone that
[21:04] he can use yeah
[21:05] to magnify his brain
[21:07] amen
[21:09] hallelujah praise god
[21:12] so we're not we don't have all those
[21:14] gifts but we know some do praise god
[21:20] now it depends what you mean by miracles
[21:22] but if you mean like a dead being raised
[21:24] or something like that or instant
[21:25] miracles i think the biggest miracles
[21:27] i've seen in my ministry is the
[21:29] individuals that were healed of
[21:31] the nerve trouble in the back
[21:33] of sister
[21:35] beatrice from
[21:37] columbus
[21:42] the in uh a lot of them met overseas you
[21:45] know
[21:46] uh the brother was healed of a kidney
[21:47] stone or the sister that was healed of a
[21:49] kidney stone the brother that was healed
[21:50] of arthritis right after right after
[21:52] pray for them
[21:54] just instant miracles instant
[21:57] now many times church we find out a lot
[21:59] of our prayers are instant right
[22:02] so what does it mean it means we have to
[22:03] have some faith praise god
[22:05] god's power is still going to flow but
[22:08] it's not going to flow when we want it
[22:09] to
[22:10] because we don't control the hose right
[22:14] we can pray you know sometimes we're
[22:15] speaking that we speak at the same time
[22:17] god is unleashing the host amen and let
[22:19] the power flow the rain come down amen
[22:21] hallelujah praise god sometimes
[22:24] that's a mighty rush of power amen
[22:26] other times you've got to wait
[22:31] but see god is in control praise god god
[22:34] wants to do miracles and those lives who
[22:36] are the people's lives who have the gift
[22:38] of miracles praise the lord and church
[22:41] don't count yourself out no
[22:43] abraham didn't see a miracle or vision
[22:44] until he was 75.
[22:46] don't count yourself out most of the
[22:48] part the red c2 is more than 80. the
[22:50] church said
[22:52] so i'm trying to encourage you praise
[22:53] god just be faithful to god amen
[22:56] just wait on god be faithful to god live
[22:58] a consecrated life praise god
[23:02] wait on god
[23:05] you know in the book of acts reminds me
[23:06] of austin kind of
[23:09] austin's testimony member he shared he
[23:10] was kind of involved in the occult
[23:12] remember that
[23:14] and by the way we've been on this first
[23:15] podcast this week
[23:18] that song sounds really good brother
[23:22] in acts 19 paul preached i think it was
[23:24] in ephesus i'm not mistaken
[23:27] he preached so hard that they took their
[23:29] occult books and the bible said they
[23:31] made a pile of them and burned them
[23:33] praise the lord and the cost of them was
[23:36] like in the millions or something like
[23:37] them just a huge number
[23:39] 50 000 pieces of silver i mean can you
[23:41] imagine
[23:42] these were very costly occult books and
[23:45] what the bible say
[23:46] just the burning glory just the burning
[23:49] of satanic bibles glory
[23:51] just the burning of occult books amen
[23:54] just uh
[23:55] just the uh uh the getting rid of the
[23:57] cult books the bible said mightily grew
[24:00] the word of god and prevailed amen in
[24:03] other words when you finally flush that
[24:05] last cigarette down the toilet that's
[24:06] the mighty work of god amen
[24:08] sure hallelujah sure
[24:11] when you finally go to the last time of
[24:12] doing something you're no longer
[24:14] addicted that's a mighty move of god
[24:16] hallelujah
[24:17] not discount these mighty works of god
[24:19] you see our thinking sometimes has to be
[24:21] expanded
[24:23] the fact austin's here is a mighty work
[24:25] of god let me say this the fact you're
[24:27] here is a mighty work of god
[24:29] is that right
[24:30] the fact you're here amen amen in fact
[24:32] you're here the fact we're here it's a
[24:34] mighty work of god if he's delivered you
[24:36] from demonic powers then you ought to
[24:38] praise god amen
[24:40] if he delivered you from temptations and
[24:42] addictions and all these things it's a
[24:44] mighty work of god you ought to praise
[24:46] god for that amen
[24:48] amen
[24:51] so the larger the number of commerce the
[24:53] more mighty the moon
[24:55] but if one person could say brother
[24:56] william in my book that's a mighty
[24:58] that's a mighty revival
[25:05] [Applause]
[25:06] when we got saved out of lima brother
[25:08] there was like 40 or 50 of us that got
[25:09] baptized they called it was one of the
[25:11] biggest revivals in the area
[25:13] ever that was around 2000 that's right
[25:16] i'm sorry 2001 2002 2003.
[25:19] look what race up by there how many
[25:20] preachers we got out of there now at
[25:21] least five or six
[25:22] [Music]
[25:24] yeah
[25:25] a mighty move so the more satan's
[25:27] kingdom is torn down and destroyed the
[25:29] more mighty the revival is praise amen
[25:32] amen amen
[25:33] amen
[25:35] [Music]
[25:38] now look paul says god works in him
[25:40] mightily how does god work in mightily
[25:42] and paul well first you've got to have
[25:44] christ
[25:45] in you the hope of glory
[25:48] and the church said
[25:49] now this is speaking of the baptism of
[25:51] the holy ghost church so paul no doubt
[25:53] was baptized in the holy ghost so god
[25:55] worked in him mightily but listen if
[25:56] you're not born again yet and you're
[25:58] still moving towards there you can still
[26:00] be mighty because in the old testament
[26:01] they didn't have the baptism holy ghost
[26:03] and the bible still called almighty amen
[26:06] praise the lord church
[26:07] so any of us children you can be mighty
[26:09] even if you just got baptized this year
[26:11] or last year you can still be mighty
[26:14] god's power can flow through you praise
[26:16] god
[26:16] to win a soul or to witness to someone
[26:19] or pray for the sick and they recovered
[26:21] god wants to do mighty things through
[26:23] all our lives he just needs someone
[26:25] who's used to him praise god
[26:28] he just needs someone who would say lord
[26:29] use me today and show your mighty powers
[26:32] when was the last time we prayed that
[26:34] when was the last time i prayed that
[26:35] well earlier because i knew i was gonna
[26:37] preach on it
[26:38] right before the sermon when was the
[26:40] last time we prayed for it
[26:42] god sent the mighty move send the mighty
[26:44] power of the holy was the last time we
[26:46] pray for that praise god
[26:49] see we got to be desiring it we got to
[26:51] be uh we got to be in position so god
[26:53] can use us for that because god is
[26:56] looking to show himself strong on his
[26:58] behalf
[27:01] bless the lord god so what was christ's
[27:03] new hope with glory he said when when we
[27:05] have christ in us we preach we warn
[27:07] every man
[27:10] we teach every man in all wisdom
[27:12] so when you've got christ in you you can
[27:14] warn men and you can teach men sure sure
[27:18] that we may present every man perfect
[27:20] you see some people need a warning they
[27:22] just want to obey god so you got to warn
[27:24] them
[27:24] see if you do this
[27:26] satan's going to get a hold of you
[27:29] other people don't need warning you just
[27:30] got to show them in the bible they'll do
[27:32] it
[27:33] that's because they love the lord the
[27:34] church said amen
[27:36] and then so this is christ and paul a
[27:39] holy ghost filled prophet said i've got
[27:41] to warn some man but i've got to teach
[27:43] others but i'll do both because christ
[27:45] is in me why because i'm laboring and
[27:48] i'm striving i'm trying to reach
[27:51] something i'm striving according to his
[27:53] working which worketh in me mightily
[27:55] praise god
[27:56] see now this is another good scripture
[27:57] for teaching brother william because he
[27:59] said i'm teaching and that's christ
[28:01] working in me mightily
[28:03] so what is it with these message
[28:04] preachers that don't like teachers see
[28:06] they miss they miss the bible
[28:08] now i believe you've got to preach
[28:09] preach i got to think i believe you've
[28:10] got to preach power and all these things
[28:12] but paul says the holy ghost worked it
[28:15] in mightily to warn all men and to teach
[28:18] all men and the church said amen it's
[28:20] colossians chapter one
[28:23] see
[28:24] so see our thinking on mighty uh it can
[28:27] change
[28:27] right
[28:29] well how many want to see mighty things
[28:30] in their life amen
[28:32] now let's take a brief little look at
[28:34] a general look at david's mighty man
[28:36] because this was my inspiration
[28:38] if you haven't seen that david you've
[28:39] got to go see david
[28:41] man that was good that was good
[28:42] now there's at least 37 men listed in
[28:45] the chapters there's two chapters you
[28:47] know one in second samuel one in first
[28:48] chronicles 11
[28:50] about the mighty men they they were
[28:51] israel's greatest warriors during the
[28:53] days of david
[28:56] right
[28:57] uh and of course not all
[28:59] men not all of them were in this group
[29:01] at the same time there's at least two of
[29:03] them that died while they were in that
[29:04] the the bible calls them a group of
[29:06] thirty there was always thirty mighty
[29:07] men
[29:08] thirties the age jesus started with the
[29:10] holy ghost dude amen
[29:13] same age uh a priesthood minister was
[29:15] 30. yeah same age john the baptist
[29:17] started in his ministry 30 years right
[29:20] but austin you're five years away
[29:21] brother get ready
[29:23] get ready god's gonna use you man hit
[29:24] 30. no it's just it's just a tight thing
[29:27] there is some significance to it as well
[29:29] i mean there is
[29:32] i know my life throws over the great
[29:33] significance in 30 years
[29:36] i could document that i could preach on
[29:37] it
[29:38] but uriah was one of the examples david
[29:40] had him killed well someone had to take
[29:41] his place
[29:43] right so there was always 30 but there's
[29:45] a total of 37. so this lasted church
[29:47] just for a generation
[29:49] think about that george our generation
[29:51] williams towards the end of his
[29:52] generation i'm right in the middle
[29:55] i'm not far behind brother
[29:57] but during our generation
[29:59] if it was like david there'd be just a
[30:01] small group that they'd call mighty men
[30:04] or let me say this mighty women that's
[30:06] right praise god praise god god's not a
[30:09] respecter of persons
[30:10] you don't have to be a preacher to be
[30:12] mighty amen no
[30:13] hello
[30:15] what about stephen the bible said he was
[30:16] full of the fire full of the holy ghost
[30:18] full of signs miracles and wonders and
[30:20] he was just a deacon amen just
[30:23] he wasn't a preacher
[30:26] philip had four virgin daughters that
[30:28] prophesied amen
[30:30] that could say don't say the lord this
[30:32] will come to pass and it came to pass so
[30:34] they try to say it as loud as i do you
[30:35] know with that thing bulging out and
[30:37] stuff like that they probably said well
[30:38] don't say the lord you're the lord
[30:40] hallelujah thank you sisters
[30:44] but was that mighty or is that wimpy
[30:45] what do you think church
[30:47] which one of you foretell prophecies all
[30:49] the time now brother ready
[30:51] but which one
[30:52] see it's a very it's a rare thing but it
[30:54] takes someone who's consecrated
[30:57] who's got the gift yeah who's submitted
[31:00] who knows their gift
[31:02] and they're dedicated and they want to
[31:04] be faithful and they want to show god's
[31:06] strength to this world
[31:08] now years ago church years ago this is
[31:10] something i i'm gonna have to follow up
[31:12] on in prayer
[31:14] after i turned 30 brother
[31:16] that's when cam came to our church and
[31:18] actually when i was 29 ken came to our
[31:20] church and he preached just once more
[31:21] lord
[31:24] and after that brother i i remember john
[31:26] and graham and i we prayed for 45
[31:27] minutes at the altar
[31:29] i'm not sure if i cried or not but i
[31:30] know we prayed for 45 minutes right
[31:32] after that that's when my wife got
[31:33] healed of the migraines
[31:34] and the miracles started multiplying
[31:37] and i told the lord i said if you
[31:38] continue this i'll write a book on jesus
[31:40] christ the same yesterday today and
[31:41] forever and just write
[31:44] just write testimonies very so long i
[31:47] didn't make a vow
[31:48] an official vow
[31:50] but this is something i need to pray
[31:51] about
[31:53] all right praise god now in my current
[31:55] in my uh in my 2021 book i have the nine
[31:58] gifts of the holy spirit in chapter 10
[32:01] and i have a lot of your testimonies in
[32:02] there i have some of your testimonies
[32:04] right that's great and some of mine too
[32:06] so i was able to testify but see that
[32:08] that's something i want to pray about
[32:09] for the future if god's going to let us
[32:10] be here then god find me faithful that
[32:13] you can show yourself mighty and i can
[32:15] share your testimonies
[32:17] praise god bless god to what to raise
[32:20] people's faith especially for the next
[32:22] generation they need to see the power of
[32:24] god yeah yeah
[32:26] to see the power of god amen we need
[32:28] reminders of god's power right now
[32:31] mature christians
[32:33] us
[32:34] older christians yeah but we need
[32:36] reminders too because we get caught up
[32:37] in the carnal just the regular routine
[32:40] of life we need god to shake up our
[32:41] lives stir us up amen
[32:44] hallelujah
[32:49] they're also called 30 chiefs
[32:55] now the three of the three of course
[32:57] that were uh the the leaders were
[33:00] joshev shabeth okay but it's also a dino
[33:05] eliezer shama and the main text of those
[33:07] will get to those
[33:08] hopefully next week now church i saw
[33:10] this i started studying the bible on
[33:12] mighty men
[33:13] there's mighty men on both sides
[33:16] but it depends what you call mighty
[33:19] in genesis 6 the first time you see
[33:21] mighty men
[33:22] the offspring of the
[33:25] the mixed spiritual marriages
[33:28] notice i didn't say natural
[33:29] spiritual
[33:31] right
[33:32] well they might actually there might
[33:33] have been some natural there too yeah
[33:35] there might have been some natural dude
[33:37] because you you still had the sea lion
[33:39] of cain
[33:40] yeah that's right and eventually they
[33:41] all got mixed at the time of noah
[33:43] yeah so there might have been some
[33:44] natural end spirit but definitely
[33:46] spiritual
[33:47] praise god the reason so when those sons
[33:49] of god when those sons of seth looked
[33:51] and they said well we got our
[33:53] we got our message daughters and we have
[33:55] our uh
[33:56] we have our judas iscariot daughters
[33:58] they took but they're better looking
[34:00] they chose the judas the law they chose
[34:02] the lost ones or the the
[34:05] the hittites or the bailites you know
[34:07] whatever they call them you know
[34:08] they chose the worldly sexy dress women
[34:10] instead of the godly ones
[34:12] their offspring became men of renown
[34:16] mighty men the bible says
[34:18] and that means reputation fame or glory
[34:22] okay
[34:24] so instead of having a reputation for
[34:26] serving god the offspring of of the
[34:29] intermarrying between
[34:32] uh cain's line and cest line produced
[34:35] men that became
[34:36] human glory they had human faith they
[34:39] had human reputation they didn't have
[34:41] god's reputation right that's the point
[34:43] i'm making that's right
[34:46] in other words if you want god's
[34:47] reputation obey all the word of god amen
[34:50] hallelujah
[34:54] and what what did these mighty men
[34:56] produce will they produce such a wicked
[34:58] age that god destroyed it with water
[35:00] that's right
[35:01] so the first mighty men we see labeled
[35:03] in the scripture
[35:04] were sinners
[35:05] right and eventually got punished with
[35:07] the flood
[35:09] also uh moses was dancing on the run i
[35:11] can't dance today so sorry my leg i just
[35:13] can't dance
[35:14] i normally not good
[35:16] normally i would it's all right but dad
[35:19] uh moses is dancing he's watching uh
[35:21] miriam and he's singing while she's
[35:23] dancing on the red sea shore and he said
[35:25] then the dukes of edom shall be amazed
[35:27] the mighty men of moab trembling shall
[35:29] take hold upon them and all the
[35:31] inhabitants shall be don't melt away
[35:33] he's prophesied
[35:34] amen
[35:35] he's prophesied saying this is what
[35:37] joshua's going to do joshua's going to
[35:39] melt all the inhabitants away that's
[35:41] right amen
[35:43] but they recognized he recognized and i
[35:45] spelled that wrong that's moa instead of
[35:47] moab forgive me
[35:49] i just caught it right there
[35:51] but moses recognized moab had mighty men
[35:54] but he wasn't afraid because he just saw
[35:56] god open the red sea praise god amen he
[35:59] just saw god drop ten plagues upon egypt
[36:02] praise god he just saw god give two
[36:05] million people a highway for the city

[36:08] hallelujah
[36:09] he ain't afraid of any mighty men from
[36:11] moab

[36:15] and he's got the pillar of fire ain't
[36:16] man

[36:21] cloud behind him
[36:23] damn
[36:24] hmm guys got nothing to be afraid of
[36:26] that's true who was the real mighty men
[36:28] then it was actually moses
[36:30] amen
[36:32] moab called themselves body but really
[36:34] the mighty men was moses and joshua
[36:35] right there
[36:38] no but
[36:39] and here god told joshua once they're
[36:41] there in the promised land he said i've
[36:44] given you the hand of jericho and all
[36:46] their mighty men of valor
[36:50] pay attention church pay attention

[37:20] the promise of god when god adopts you
[37:22] into his family you become a mighty
[37:24] believer praise god praise the lord
[37:27] praise the lord same thing in joshua
[37:29] chapter eight verse three
[37:31] joshua says i gotta go up and i gotta
[37:33] defeat these kings i'm gonna take 30 000
[37:36] mighty men
[37:41] my church how are we going to be mighty
[37:42] if we can't read our bibles and pray
[37:44] every day and talk to god every day
[37:47] how are we going to do it the man said
[37:49] you want to fall in love with god what
[37:50] do you say read your bible and pray
[37:52] yeah how are you gonna do it god's
[37:54] looking first that's right men and women
[37:55] praise god that's right he's searching
[37:58] for somebody who wants to be strong
[37:59] today who wants to have a testimony
[38:01] today
[38:02] amen
[38:03] see
[38:05] joshua's soldiers were mighty men they
[38:07] were in the land they were baptized with
[38:09] the holy ghost and god said use the
[38:11] mighty man that's why i sent him here
[38:12] praise god amen that's the truth amen
[38:15] now i know that simon brought this out a
[38:17] number of months ago not not saturday
[38:19] but he brought this out in an awesome
[38:21] way where he was showing how
[38:23] on the job he couldn't remember the
[38:24] numbers but he could remember all the
[38:25] scriptures
[38:28] and i thought that's exactly like it for
[38:30] me i teach little kids in a such a
[38:32] humble uh maybe a
[38:34] least esteemed job and i get to come and
[38:36] preach the gospel to believe or say amen
[38:38] you know it's just it's a paradox amen
[38:42] for ye see your calling brethren how
[38:44] that many
[38:45] not many wise men after the flesh not
[38:48] many mighty not many noble are called
[38:51] in other words you're not going to see
[38:52] many message people that were really
[38:54] great people in life
[38:56] i mean the most famous one i know
[38:58] brother is a pastor uh i can't remember
[39:00] what state he's in but he played the nfl
[39:03] i just talked him on the phone
[39:05] uh he sat under leave ale remember him
[39:07] his name is brian yeah yeah i talked to
[39:09] him on the phone well he played in the
[39:10] national football league that's a very
[39:12] big
[39:12] accomplishment as far as i know he's the
[39:14] most famous message believer
[39:17] that i know
[39:19] and now today nobody would know him
[39:20] because that was back in the 70s right
[39:22] yeah
[39:24] uh
[39:25] brother steven's dad played the nfl so
[39:27] stephen uh
[39:29] haverdick now he changed his name but
[39:30] his dad's name is haverdick dave
[39:32] haverdick he played the nfl
[39:35] so i know too mighty man according to
[39:38] the flesh that god has called the
[39:39] message too
[39:41] that's not a lot
[39:43] two
[39:44] now why did god do this why didn't god
[39:46] choose more you know like the ceo of
[39:48] amazon or why did why do you choose like
[39:50] the ceo of apple or somebody like that
[39:52] somebody from the nba or some steph
[39:54] curry or something like that because god
[39:56] chose the foolish things of the world to
[39:58] confound the wise in other words god
[40:00] knew those people wanted to be foolish
[40:02] god could only his eyes were something
[40:04] for somebody that wanted to be wise amen
[40:07] god can only use the people that want to
[40:08] be used hallelujah
[40:10] that's it
[40:11] that's where is that that's right
[40:14] god's chosen the weak
[40:16] that's me to confound the things which
[40:18] are mighty naturally praise god
[40:23] so that's why god doesn't save more
[40:24] famous people because they are foolish
[40:27] in the things of the world yeah
[40:29] they will not
[40:32] make themselves weak for the gospel's
[40:34] sake
[40:35] they still remember like they want to
[40:36] call themselves christians but yeah
[40:38] having a homosexual pastor is okay with
[40:39] them
[40:40] right god can't call them
[40:43] to a higher calling because he knows
[40:45] they don't want it
[40:47] right that's what the bible says
[40:49] only a few not many only a few are
[40:53] called that are mighty after the flesh
[40:56] how many big bodybuilders you've seen
[40:57] the message not too many
[40:59] not too many
[41:01] not many mighty men
[41:03] if they are they better be careful too
[41:06] right you don't want to be a summoning
[41:07] block
[41:08] right there's not many
[41:11] how many famous women are you know
[41:13] i don't know i'm not sure what a godly
[41:15] woman could be famous for
[41:18] but you don't see too many
[41:20] there's not there's not many
[41:22] god's using the humble
[41:24] and this is the beautiful part god
[41:26] always calls the humble and the least
[41:28] and the spies and makes them mighty
[41:32] if you are weak and despise and cast out
[41:34] you are the perfect candidate for god to
[41:37] use amen
[41:38] [Applause]
[41:40] amen
[41:42] you're just the kind of person god wants
[41:44] to use
[41:45] if you're weak
[41:47] not very smart you don't come from a
[41:49] wealthy family or you're just the one
[41:51] god wants to use god said i'll take that
[41:53] one grace
[41:54] god passes all over all the millionaires
[41:57] all that when i was billionaires and
[41:58] trillionaires right and i was
[41:59] billionaire brother he bypassed all the
[42:02] billionaires they trusted their money
[42:03] god said oh can i find somebody yeah
[42:05] there's somebody in action i can trust
[42:07] it
[42:07] [Music]
[42:09] i can trust them amen
[42:11] i'll bypass all the worldly ones and
[42:14] don't want my knowledge and i'll give it
[42:15] to the humble ones
[42:17] because then i can use them
[42:19] and like they won't take credit for it
[42:21] either no
[42:22] don't give jesus all the credit amen
[42:27] there's going to be mighty men naturally
[42:29] all the way down here in the sixth seal
[42:31] the bible said the uh once the sun is
[42:33] blackened out right the moon becomes
[42:35] blood
[42:36] the mighty men are going to hide
[42:37] themselves in caves saying kill us kill
[42:39] us but death will escape them
[42:43] because they fought against the lamb
[42:45] and then church these mighty men are
[42:47] going to become bird food
[42:48] yeah
[42:49] that's true see i don't want to eat bird
[42:51] food i'm going to be the bird
[42:54] i'm going to be the eagle by the way
[42:56] i don't
[42:58] [Applause]
[43:00] but they become bird food yes they do
[43:03] the mighty men how muddy are they now
[43:05] with birds eating them
[43:06] not very mighty
[43:08] these skinny little tiny little birds
[43:10] there's lightweight birds that get eaten
[43:11] up by birds that's not mighty
[43:14] they thought it was mighty but it wasn't
[43:16] mighty god help us to be humble so god
[43:18] can make us mighty
[43:24] amen so we have these two groups of
[43:27] mighty men what's the difference
[43:29] the difference is brother god's on our
[43:32] side
[43:32] that's it
[43:34] that's right that's the only way you and
[43:35] i can be mighty
[43:37] the only way
[43:39] we're going to get it any other way
[43:41] except the lord is on our side
[43:45] trying to raise your faith tonight
[43:48] laurie
[43:50] now let's look just look at this out of
[43:51] the easier real quick but there's in
[43:53] this in this section about the mighty
[43:55] men
[43:56] there's two statements that prove
[43:58] that these mighty men did not do this on
[44:01] their own power
[44:03] you will do nothing on your own power i
[44:06] can do nothing on my own power praise
[44:08] god no
[44:10] no
[44:10] like this week i can hardly walk up the
[44:12] stairs
[44:13] how am i going to go heal the sick when
[44:14] i'm sick yeah i can hardly i'm getting
[44:16] no better now by god's grace
[44:19] right
[44:20] we have no power but god here's the
[44:22] answer right in the bible
[44:24] glory the bible says the lord wrote a
[44:27] great victory that day praise god
[44:30] the lord which means jehovah which means
[44:32] the self-existent one the strong one the
[44:35] self-existent one brought about the
[44:37] victory for every mighty man that gives
[44:39] me hope that i can be a mighty man
[44:41] someday amen and if i just let god move
[44:44] god will use me to do a victory for his
[44:47] name
[44:49] i amen
[44:49] you already have it but i believe you
[44:50] can do more by god's grace amen
[44:55] what's the word rock mean in hebrew it
[44:57] means fashion
[44:59] so the lord fashioned or accomplished or
[45:02] made the victory possible
[45:05] so his eyes first started looking who
[45:07] can i use today who's consecrating to me
[45:09] who wants to show how strong i am today
[45:12] and then he finally finds somebody
[45:15] and then god
[45:16] takes them up and god accomplishes
[45:18] something mighty through that person
[45:21] oh so beautiful church amen and it
[45:24] beautiful
[45:25] yeah
[45:26] god accomplishes a victory through you
[45:28] and i
[45:30] so as we as we go through some of these
[45:31] testimonies of these mighty names
[45:34] it wasn't their strength that did it it
[45:36] was god's strength thank you lord praise
[45:39] the lord
[45:40] god makes you mighty hallelujah your
[45:42] strength doesn't make you mighty no no
[45:45] you can swim and run and bike and do a
[45:47] triathlete you can do all that that
[45:49] don't make you money all right you got
[45:51] to strip off your clothes to do it
[45:53] then you become instantly weak
[45:58] you lose all your spiritual strength
[45:59] amen
[46:00] that don't make you mighty
[46:02] what makes you mightiest hearing the
[46:03] voice of god obeying the voice of god
[46:06] and doing what god tells you to do
[46:07] praise god oh yes hallelujah
[46:11] blessed be the lord amen elijah had it
[46:15] right he was the type of christ here's
[46:17] what he told job he said he shall break
[46:19] in pieces mighty men without number
[46:22] that's right you can line up all the
[46:24] muscle men you want you can line up all
[46:25] the football men you can light up all
[46:27] the military men in the u.s or russia
[46:29] line them right up hi god just come down
[46:31] and just break all the way out and
[46:33] you're gonna breathe and just destroy it
[46:35] amen
[46:37] and it just spreads like chap he's the
[46:40] great one he's the mighty one he wants
[46:42] to make us mighty through his power amen
[46:46] in other words anyone standing before
[46:48] you who you think is mighty is not
[46:50] mighty
[46:51] god's the mighty one amen
[46:57] see god knows their works he overturns
[46:59] them in the night they can die right
[47:01] they can they can fight against one
[47:02] another like we saw in the game they can
[47:03] just turn around and fight and have bad
[47:05] dreams and nightmares about you yeah
[47:07] yeah
[47:09] and they get destroyed amen yeah
[47:12] how many times do we worry about
[47:13] something and then when it comes out
[47:14] it's totally different than what we
[47:15] thought
[47:17] that's the time to be mighty praise god
[47:19] that's time to be mighty not be afraid
[47:21] but trust in god
[47:25] now let's look at three of the mightiest
[47:27] men here never set my timer that's okay
[47:32] a dino or dino he's also called joshua
[47:37] that's quite a name there
[47:39] i heard preachers call him jv i thought
[47:40] that's a pretty good name
[47:43] maybe
[47:44] bob's called medina other translations
[47:46] call him uh josh him
[47:49] king james doesn't call him that king
[47:51] james calls him a dino
[47:53] but that if you click on the hebrew word
[47:55] that's what it means there now the
[47:56] second was eliezer the third shama so
[47:59] dave was thinking
[48:00] which three of these are going to be the
[48:01] greatest of my my mighty men
[48:05] and so let's find out how we want to
[48:06] find out what made them so mighty i hope
[48:08] you do because it's going to make you
[48:09] mine
[48:14] so a dino there's only one verse about
[48:16] him now church we read it what'd he do
[48:18] he lift up a spear
[48:20] against 800
[48:22] whom he slew at one time
[48:25] 800
[48:27] not eight
[48:29] not 80
[48:32] 800. now that's a little less than
[48:35] samson did a few years before that
[48:37] samson did a thousand
[48:39] now i was reading about samson when he
[48:40] when he defeated the thousand he had a
[48:42] new jawbone and i think i have the
[48:43] scriptures up there
[48:45] but when the historians actually studied
[48:47] it he was up on a hill
[48:51] or an elevated place compared to these
[48:53] thousand philistines that he imagined a
[48:55] thousand people rushing at you
[48:58] but history says he was up on a hill and
[49:00] those men had marched a very long
[49:02] distance
[49:04] so they were naturally worn out
[49:07] right they were a little bit worn out
[49:08] and they had a command if they didn't
[49:09] kill try to kill samson they were going
[49:11] to get killed themselves
[49:14] and then and then also there was a
[49:16] there's a host of israelite warriors
[49:18] just watching it so they didn't they
[49:20] thought well they could come get us so
[49:21] we'll just go after samson
[49:24] so in other words this this wasn't like
[49:26] maybe something impossible that we would
[49:28] think but he still had the spirit of god
[49:31] on and he took that new jawbone all
[49:34] right
[49:35] and they're running up to him now what
[49:37] could you do if he were just running at
[49:38] you
[49:40] you already got the leverage
[49:42] that's right
[49:43] now in one swing maybe you can knock all
[49:45] three i don't know
[49:46] maybe two
[49:48] but he took that jawbone and he's up on
[49:50] that elevated spot and he starts bam bam
[49:54] bam and pretty soon
[49:57] he's got a thousand now the bow said he
[49:59] slew a thousand glory
[50:02] yeah but he's ours god gave him the
[50:04] upper hand amen church if god's gonna do
[50:06] something minding you he's gonna give
[50:08] you the upper hand amen ask the lord
[50:11] when i preached on david and goliath
[50:12] years ago in here when somebody was
[50:13] still coming in i showed you through the
[50:15] science if you do the stone hard enough
[50:18] it will kill you if if you're like a a
[50:20] strong 20 year old or something like
[50:22] that it will literally kill somebody
[50:24] right that wasn't like i probably uh
[50:26] dramatized it saying with the speed of
[50:28] light you know i might have
[50:29] but it didn't need to
[50:31] god just needed a boy to step out there
[50:34] and to stand up for the word of god amen
[50:37] and stand up for the message amen i knew
[50:40] you had to fling the stone and throw it
[50:43] he didn't have to have a supernatural
[50:44] thing he just had to be supernaturally
[50:46] led to stand and fight and that's what
[50:48] we need to do just stand and fight for
[50:50] the word of god
[50:54] see we picture something like you know
[50:56] just
[50:57] samson's swinging that and like 50
[50:59] people die
[51:00] it might not have been
[51:02] he had tired soldiers and they just they
[51:04] knew they're going to die and then
[51:05] they're also looking at all the soldiers
[51:06] up there and they had no choice
[51:09] and i'm not i'm not uh
[51:11] i'm not degrading the the victory the
[51:14] victory was great
[51:15] but all these things you got to take
[51:17] into account god set him up god gave him
[51:20] the the weapon now still the weapon not
[51:21] breaking that's a supernatural thing
[51:23] right a bone not breaking on their brass
[51:25] helmets
[51:27] it's just god amen
[51:30] it's gone so samson to the thousand
[51:33] and a dino does 800. different weapon
[51:36] though
[51:38] different weapon
[51:40] here's what they think the weapon looks
[51:41] like
[51:43] spear now of course it's got a longer
[51:44] end so it looked more like that okay
[51:46] more that's a cartoonish one but you get
[51:48] the idea right
[51:51] so he takes his spear
[51:53] and he
[51:54] he destroys 800 people now that means he
[51:57] can't let the spear leave he's got to
[51:58] take that he's got to have the spear the
[51:59] whole time
[52:00] he's got to hold it so he's got the
[52:02] sharp man he's got this other end maybe
[52:03] he had two sharp ends i don't know
[52:06] but the spirit of god comes on him and
[52:08] he takes down 800 all in one fight
[52:11] praise god and this man is made the
[52:13] chief of all the mighty men
[52:15] because with one weapon glory with one
[52:18] weapon he took down a whole army praise
[52:20] god that's what we do that's what the
[52:22] bible does that's what jesus with the
[52:24] word of god hallelujah
[52:27] every fall is defeated with one weapon
[52:29] all of our foes are defeated with one
[52:30] weapon
[52:37] a shark spear hallelujah
[52:40] oh who's gonna david said who's gonna
[52:42] i'm a man after god's own heart i say
[52:44] the giant who's gonna be my number one
[52:45] soldier the guy that killed 800
[52:48] all by himself
[52:50] with one weapon
[52:52] one weapon
[52:54] hallelujah what the bible say
[52:59] god had already promised her joshua one
[53:01] man will chase a thousand
[53:03] is that fulfilled or not church sure
[53:06] is god's word does god word come back
[53:08] void no no
[53:10] for the lord your god he fights for you
[53:12] as he promised you
[53:15] in other words if you know there's a
[53:16] general promise for god yes as we as we
[53:18] taught a few weeks ago you've got to
[53:19] seek god for god's will and then if you
[53:21] know it's god's will then you can fight
[53:24] and fight and fight and you know god
[53:26] will back up his word amen
[53:28] hallelujah
[53:32] that's what sam said he found a new
[53:33] jawbone
[53:35] sue a thousand men
[53:37] great the bomb said he was so tired god
[53:39] i'm gonna kill these men you're gonna
[53:40] let me uh uh you're gonna let me have a
[53:43] third you're gonna starve to death and
[53:44] then he got water out of it praise god
[53:46] he broke it over and had enough water to
[53:48] strengthen himself amen oh my god is
[53:51] faithful amen
[53:54] see all of our mighty acts are based
[53:56] upon god's promises
[53:59] so god made the promise what's he what
[54:01] he needs is somebody who's strong to
[54:02] fight
[54:03] yeah that's what he needs that's it
[54:05] somebody's willing to step out and defy
[54:07] the devil praise the lord god help us
[54:10] all amen amen
[54:14] so you get the idea
[54:16] now what's the lesson we get a believer
[54:18] can defeat any size army that's that's
[54:20] the lesson you get here
[54:23] the greatest warrior was the one who
[54:24] defeated the largest number of people
[54:26] all by himself
[54:27] he didn't need somebody else for that
[54:29] battle
[54:30] all he needed was god amen brother
[54:33] sometimes you don't need my prayer
[54:34] sometimes you just need god amen
[54:37] i'll pray for you right you'll pray for
[54:39] me but sometimes i don't need your
[54:40] prayer i need god to come on the scene
[54:42] amen
[54:43] that's true i want to pray for you
[54:45] though i do
[54:46] i want you to pray for me i do yeah
[54:50] but david said this man all right
[54:53] this man will be my chief great because
[54:55] that is the chief of the chiefs that's
[54:57] right
[54:59] the greatest of the great
[55:00] right looking at that a lot lately
[55:06] so that's the lesson we get
[55:09] if you're a believer trusting in god and
[55:11] you've got a strong weapon you can
[55:12] defeat any size option any size obstacle
[55:15] right
[55:16] praise god you can defeat cancer
[55:18] yeah tuberculosis
[55:21] amen amen
[55:24] covenant 19.
[55:26] you can defeat it praise god amen amen
[55:29] if you got the weapon and willing to
[55:30] fight and god's anointing you you can
[55:32] defeat any size army amen by the word of
[55:35] god
[55:36] amen
[55:37] the second is eliezer
[55:41] he was one of the three mighty ones the
[55:42] bible said now he defied the philistines
[55:45] that were gathered together to battle
[55:47] and the men of israel going away now if
[55:48] you study this in other versions it
[55:50] actually says the men of israel left the
[55:52] battle they were afraid
[55:54] so he said out there elise is out there
[55:56] let's fight that's about and all of a
[55:58] sudden they see the philistine army and
[55:59] everybody's like leaving
[56:02] but there was something in l.a shoes
[56:04] like cement he said i'm not going
[56:05] anywhere crazy you guys can run if you
[56:08] want you can get the spoilers later i'm
[56:10] going to fight this
[56:11] guy
[56:12] can you imagine that
[56:14] imagine your whole church won't even
[56:15] come and pray for you
[56:18] and the church said amen all your
[56:20] friends all your church friends don't
[56:21] want nothing to do with it
[56:23] that's what happened
[56:25] all the church deserted him and he was
[56:27] standing alone against the enemy praise
[56:28] god so church if you're deserted don't
[56:31] feel bad god's still with you amen
[56:34] let that people desert you let people

[56:45] and no matter how many people you have
[56:47] with you god will back you up praise god
[56:49] amen that's his holy name amen amen
[56:54] he was deserted
[56:56] but did you know as he fought on
[56:58] his hand became so weary they could not
[57:01] take his hand off the sword in other
[57:03] words he became one with the word of god
[57:05] praise god
[57:07] the sword by the way it was not a
[57:09] different part of him a sword the sword
[57:11] was a part of him
[57:14] yeah and it fit his hand so perfectly
[57:16] the king so hard at man
[57:17] [Applause]

[57:21] you could not detach it
[57:23] this is now a part of me the word and i
[57:26] are one christ is in me i'm a part of
[57:28] christ you and me i and you praise god

[57:49] them do whatever they want don't feel
[57:50] bad about it you just stand with the
[57:52] word

[57:55] fight
[57:59] and again church who wrought this
[58:00] victory who did this

[1:02:54] god gave them
[1:02:55] right

[1:02:58] what are the three mightiest people i
[1:03:00] can find the one that stands no matter
[1:03:02] how big the enemy is
[1:03:05] the one that stands who will just cling
[1:03:07] to the word
[1:03:08] and the third is the one who will not
[1:03:10] give up what god has already given to
[1:03:12] them
[1:03:14] and they stood alone lord each one of
[1:03:17] these people stood alone nobody was
[1:03:19] standing with them they stood alone and
[1:03:21] david makes them you're my mightiest man
[1:03:23] amen
[1:03:25] the ones who stood there all by himself

[1:04:56] a heart that really loves god
[1:04:58] [Music]
[1:05:02] have they become so mighty
[1:05:05] the bible said when dave was still
[1:05:06] running from saul he escaped he was he
[1:05:09] was a fugitive
[1:05:11] and he went to the cave of
[1:05:12] adelaide
[1:05:14] and when his brethren and all his
[1:05:15] father's house heard it they went
[1:05:16] feather to him and everyone that was in
[1:05:19] distress
[1:05:20] everyone that was in debt
[1:05:22] everyone that was discontented gathered
[1:05:24] themselves unto him and he became a
[1:05:26] captain over them
[1:05:28] and they were with him about 400 men
[1:05:32] so look out of these 400 about 30 became
[1:05:34] the mighty ones
[1:05:37] that's good that's like that's like a
[1:05:38] tenth right there's a time amen
[1:05:41] about a time become mighty men that's
[1:05:43] right

[1:05:50] you might be stressed out
[1:05:52] too
[1:05:54] today you might be in debt

[1:17:36] be mighty too yeah come to our house
[1:17:38] you're gonna go here you'll hear the
[1:17:39] girls sing it pretty much
[1:17:42] and some guys too like dads
[1:17:46] they can't really sing that well though
[1:17:48] but see the lord became this mighty man
[1:17:50] shepherd that's how he become mighty
[1:17:53] last time god had to train him even
[1:17:55] though his dad rejected brother
[1:17:57] just like my dad left me
[1:18:00] just like his dad rejected him it didn't
[1:18:02] matter because the heavenly father
[1:18:03] became his dad
[1:18:05] he recognized he was really my horde my
[1:18:07] dad the whole time
[1:18:09] he's out there all by himself with sheep
[1:18:11] and you know the story
[1:18:16] you know the story
[1:18:17] a lion would come out right and this man
[1:18:20] this young teenager was so under the
[1:18:21] anointing the bible said he would chase
[1:18:24] down the lion and catch him by the beard
[1:18:27] yeah
[1:18:28] he'd grab looks like he looked use your
[1:18:29] magnet he grabbed like this and said
[1:18:31] give me that lamb man
[1:18:34] yeah yeah
[1:18:35] he probably wouldn't tear the lamb
[1:18:37] but he was like pull it down the lamb
[1:18:38] would fall out and then i don't know
[1:18:40] what he would do
[1:18:45] i smoked him
[1:18:46] yeah
[1:18:47] you got a big stick maybe maybe a spear
[1:18:50] oh yeah the ride on the staff that's
[1:18:51] right around the staff that's
[1:18:57] must have been the power of god or maybe
[1:18:59] hit him right in the eye or some weak
[1:19:00] spot you know
[1:19:02] the holy spirit directed that rod right
[1:19:04] to the spot and knock the line out maybe
[1:19:06] kill him right after that i don't know
[1:19:09] but that's real anointing
[1:19:12] and then a bear come up
[1:19:16] and he does the same thing to the bear
[1:19:18] i'm not afraid of that bear
[1:19:20] these are god's sheep all right
[1:19:22] i'm the shepherd god glory god
[1:19:24] commissioned me to save these souls can
[1:19:26] i say like that
[1:19:27] god's commissioned you to win souls god
[1:19:30] has commissioned me to win souls we have
[1:19:32] to fight for the souls we have to
[1:19:33] earnestly contend to save souls we gotta
[1:19:36] pray harder we gotta pray more we gotta
[1:19:38] fight for these little lambs we gotta
[1:19:40] rescue god's land amen
[1:19:43] praise god
[1:19:46] somebody's gotta pray for him yeah
[1:19:49] you and i got to pray for him true
[1:19:56] so david this was clear already clear
[1:19:59] before you call goliath he's already a
[1:20:00] mighty man
[1:20:02] because he spent time worshiping god
[1:20:05] see he became a mighty man because he
[1:20:07] was a humble shepherd and he became
[1:20:09] mighty by understanding that god was his
[1:20:11] shepherd
[1:20:12] amen that's how you become mighty
[1:20:16] you trust that god is with you
[1:20:18] two you rely on god yeah that's it
[1:20:23] so what's the lesson
[1:20:24] if you're faithful in a little ministry
[1:20:26] like shepherding
[1:20:28] or can say this if you're faithful with
[1:20:30] a little church
[1:20:31] all right and god will make you rule
[1:20:33] over much someday yeah
[1:20:35] like instead of watching sheep then
[1:20:36] you're going to watch souls of men
[1:20:39] praise god
[1:20:41] then you're going to fight the
[1:20:42] philistines then you're going to fight
[1:20:43] the mobile like david first he was
[1:20:45] fighting lions and bears and he got to
[1:20:46] fight goliath and goliath's brothers
[1:20:49] right
[1:20:50] her sons either brothers or sons i think
[1:20:52] he was brothers
[1:20:53] brothers
[1:20:56] see if you can be faithful with your
[1:20:57] daily walk with god amen there's hardly
[1:21:00] no way to tell what god will do with you
[1:21:03] if you can be mighty in your daily walk
[1:21:05] with the lord
[1:21:06] how many want to be mighty than their
[1:21:07] daily walk with the lord
[1:21:08] [Music]
[1:21:10] amen
