========================================

and we' like to look at the message of Grace uh brother BR preached this in 1961 and I imagine I'll have three or four maybe sermons on this and just as a review you know earlier this year I I felt led uh to preach some of these uh titles of brother am sermons that we sing in this song um just want to thank you Lord for letting me hear your word and so uh with this one I'll be a little I'll just reach over the halfway point uh there was eight songs uh I preached through recognizing your day and his message serpent seed perfect Faith the breach and this is the message of Grace so this is our our fifth out of eight by God's grace so with this one once we get this done we'll be past the halfway mark I really didn't know what I was getting into when I uh started preaching this this series here but as a pastor you always got to have new material by God's grace and so it works out gives me a kind of a direction where to go so you'll probably know where be going you know the message of Grace last verse has the coming of the lord The Rapture mystery right brother man preached on the Rapture in 1965 he preached the the sudden secret going away in 1958 uh listened to that last time I went down there to Junction City and then God in Simplicity that was preached right before the breach in March of 63 and the spoken word Original Seed if you haven't listened to that it's over a six-hour sermon brother Brandon preached it was a long long sermon and that sermon is famous for having the portion where brother randam was told by the Holy Spirit pick up your pen and write he had a word for the bride and it was all about the bride and the word how uh she's taking in the word of God and she'll only receive the word of God is that your desire just to receive the word of God hallelujah we don't desire the Creeds of men the ideas of men we know we have to live with them right as far as a pastor or preachers none of us are perfect and you know we're going to have our our thoughts on some minor things but ultimately our faith is resting uh solely in the word of God our absolute praise God so I want to look at this here uh this this tape actually begins with a tongue and interpretation and uh in this tongue interpretation there's words like I will come and rescue you be warned of the Wrath to come thus saith my spirit uh so it seems like this was a message to the the Saints there in the church and it's talked about how God had sent his Prophet there brother brandham to minister to them and uh I'm sure we all can experience that where God has rescued us out of situations especially this year right we've gone through some uh some difficult trials this year and it looks like there'll be maybe some more trials to come of course with a presidential election you never know what's going to happen uh based upon what happened last time we don't know so we're just uh trusting in God and let's stay true to the holy spirit so he can rescue us praise God and right before preaching brother B talks a little bit and he says this he's praying and he says uh God we remember especially those who are unsaved and then he says before the meeting Clos today May there be something happen Lord that would bring your presence so close to the people that they would know that the same Jesus that walked in Galilee stands in the midst of his people today Hallelujah he said they may go away from here today with the same assurance that those who came from amus that time you know brother man many times mentions that scripture out of Luke 24 right Copus and his friend are walking on the road to emus and and how do they get Jesus to come on the scene or how does Jesus come on the scene they start talking about it and that's what we have to do church we have to just talk about the Lord in our homes in our cars and here at church we're talking about God and then we feel God's sweetness come right his Spirit comes Among Us praise God as we talk about him as we sing as we worship as we give him glory Hallelujah so that's the key here and then you know uh Jesus of course hid himself from them and then brother Ram takes that thought about how Jesus hid himself from them and he said oh God so many times we are like that you speak to us in the setting of the Sun in the singing of the birds in the rustling of the leaves in the blooming of the flowers God ever speak to you looking at a flower in the hymns of the church he says and we so little recognize that it's you in the sick rooms in the hospital many other places you speak to us and we so little realize that it's you so I like how brother R he's he's offering just this humble prayer God you know it's just like on the road to mayus you're trying to show yourself to us so many ways in other words Lord just open our eyes that we can see your presence in our lives Hallelujah and he says now Lord as we return to our homes this morning may we like they did recognize may you do something today in our midst just like you did back there I love that brother Ram he uses this scripture Lord help us to recognize your presence make yourself real in a way to us tonight how many Want Jesus to be real tonight Hallelujah all it takes is just meditating on him right focusing on him talking about him thinking about him and He makes himself known to us hallelujah he said uh when they went back in their place they were rejoicing praising God and they said did not our hearts burn with within us as he talked to us along the road and brother bam says Lord you've talked to us all week now appear in our midst and make yourself known to each needy heart we ask it in jesus' name for his sake amen hallelujah and friends you know if we're out with ourselves God has talked to us all week whether it was a prayer a song a conversation we had did you listen to a sermon amen uh God was trying to speak to us all week and it was it's our responsibility to open up our hearts and say Lord are you speaking to me Lord do you want to tell me something are you trying to tell me something Hallelujah and when we do do that God reveals himself to us and right after brother finishes this prayer a sister speaks in tongues set for the second time and a brother interprets it and I want to read the part where it speaks of uh the squeeze and I made a video about this last December uh this is a 1961 sermon so the Holy Spirit spoke to the Bram Tabernacle that if they stayed true to God God would be with them during the squeeze and so we know most of these people have died out right so the Lord would have had to known that people were going to listen to these tapes right cuz God doesn't lie right the the Holy Spirit doesn't tell false things and if brother random accepted this was a interpretation of a genuine tongue then it has to be for somebody praise God hallelujah and uh the the brother then interprets the tongue it says I am rejoicing with you in my spirit and I will lift you this morning by my strong right hand in the place where and then I can't understand the word Walk Beside Me in Heavenly places because my desire this morning is unto you that your hearts might be lifted up that you might Rejoice with me in spirit and gain this Mighty Revelation and the spiritual wisdom and the understanding that you're going to need when the time comes at the persecution that's going to come just before I Rapture my bride he says you will not endure my wrath my children but persecution will come upon on you on many a side now there's other quotes brother says the bride won't be persecuted right so we know the word uh we know the word doesn't contradict himself but words can actually have multiple meanings right so we look at we look at this as uh not a persecution that would be a the wrath of God but it would be stress or pressure because we're seeing the system and we're seeing the the time of the Gentiles coming down to the end right we're seeing the mark of the beast getting closer we're seeing the re revelation of the Antichrist coming and the church said did you remember I mentioned that to you last week how the pope for the first time went to the G7 Summit the first time ever the pope getting involved with the seven Great Nations that run the economies of the world I mean now the pope is getting involved in that right so you can see it it's it's coming together closer and then it goes to show and then he says uh you will not endure my wrath my children you will be tried right because everybody's got to be tried was Paul tried remember I preached about the book of Romans was he tried yes he was tried all the way to the chopping block the martyr's block right uh William Tindale um different Martyrs down through the age they were given chances before their burn of the stake do you want to recant you your life will be spared and each time they refuse to recant because Christ was so real to them amen May Christ be real to us amen that nothing that could happen in this life would ever uh tempt us to ever leave uh the truth that God has revealed to us amen amen and church you know we all go through shakings at time you know God allows us to go through tests and trials and we all go through them and each moment it's got to come back to brother man say it's got to come back to some absolute amen right your faith where's it anchored is it anchored in some experience I mean experience is okay but that experience has to be backed up by the word of God hallelujah and so we know there's coming a great shaking time the Bible speaks of it praise God the of the Gentile Church ages and so we've got to have a faith that understands that we're going to be tried and how many want perfect Faith by God's grace remember perfect Faith wasn't being a prophet perfect faith is just knowing God's will for the situation amen hallelujah because the Bible said are all prophets are all speakers in tongues do all interpret no do all have gifts of healing no so perfect Faith isn't that we all have to know everything by a prophecy or dream perfect faith is having a revelation of the will of God for your life amen amen hallelujah you'll be tried but I will lift you up I'm sorry but I will but I'm sorry you'll be tried but if you lift up your hands and raise your voices on my behalf and testify when the going is hard I will come down and witness to you reminds us of Stephen when times got tough what did he do he looked up to heaven and Jesus uh sheltered him from the the pain of the stones right he fell asleep isn't that a great Bible type there if you draw not to God if you praise God in the storm God will rescue you hallelujah amen amen he says uh the evil device of the wicked one will come but I've spoken to you by my spirit and if you listen to my voice this morning uh you will have no wrath of God thus saith my spirit now some of those words I couldn't work out but the congregation rejoices uh they're glorifying God them brother Ram said now the congregation shall pray and they pray uh they they pray the Lord's Prayer out of Matthew chapter 6 so you know we can't say that there's anything wrong with saying a congregational prayer there's nothing wrong with saying that brother R did it on numerous occasions amen hallelujah and then I just you know here's probably one of the most important parts of this sermon I believe one reason why there was tongues and interpretation and if you haven't listened to this message I'd encourage you to do it if you haven't even listened to other ones I would encourage you to go do that as well make sure listening to some type of message sometime amen listen to something keep uh keep the prophet of God an active part of your life praise God Amen Hallelujah and then brother Bram says these words right after the Lord's Prayer he says that if my pen should be a sculptor's tool and my paper should be flint and these words that I say now should be engraved upon this that it might go to All Peoples what a statement he's basically saying Lord I just wish my words uh could be engraved on a stone and it could be sent to every person right a stone would be a very lasting testimony a stone a stone message would last much longer than a paper message right so what brother ad is going to say next is very important and I think you understand what uh we mean in just a moment from from my best understanding brother random is repeating the words of job out of job 19 job 19:23 says oh that my words were now written oh that they were printed in a book that they were Graven with an iron pen and led in the rock forever sound familiar right for I know that my redeemer liveth amen and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth and though after my skin warms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I shall see for myself and my eyes Shall Behold and not another though my Reigns may be consumed within me am so brother ad I believe is saying something uh important here and he's quoting job now brother R had done this before I'm sorry brother R would do this in the future if you remember question the answer 64 part one they asked brother Ram is it wrong to be part of a Workers Union how many got to be in the union I have to be in Union anyone have to be in a union here okay okay praise God so some of you have union rights amen it's a good thing for the most part there are some disadvantages to the union just a B I guess there's disadvantages without having a union but the union gives you rights and and uh uh uh rules to be protected by as you work and brother R says you know uh it's okay to work in a union if you can't work outside the union and brother says now you remember people remember what brother brandom saying and may My Words Be graved with an iron pen in a mountain of Steel he says thus sayith the Lord that same thing with unions will happen in religion so young people Malachi L you little ones the same thing that's happening on jobs where you have to be in a union to work there he says the same thing will happen in religion now this gives me a lot of comfort right because to join the union I'm sure if you join a union you got to do a lot of paperwork there's a lot of thought that goes into it it's not easy to join Union right you got to go through steps and processes at least in my profession it was and then I was then I got out of it by God's grace because they send all your money to the Democrats I don't want my Democrat I don't want my money going to Democrats or Republicans uh I want to go to God Amen but the point is said thus say the Lord it'll happen in religion you'll belong to a denomination of some sort or you cannot buy or sell right so be real careful brother let it just go to labor alone watch it it's a warning so 1964 there were brothers in Jeffersonville they're wondering should I join this work Union brother said go ahead it's okay but it's going to come down to religion one day and they're going to make you join a unionized religion now Church we're blessed cuz we know what's coming we know better than any Temptation well like uh you know the city of akan or the state of Ohio might send out a alert email to all the pastors you know you have to come to this conference and we like you to join this meeting well you know what I'm going to say no thank you amen right but then we know but there there's going to come pressure if you don't join just like the pressure with with some the pressure with Co and the shots was related to related to jobs right right but with religion it's going to be related to everything especially the churches because where judgment begins where judgment begins at the house of God amen amen hallelujah so you young people thus sayith the Lord remember that same pressure to join a union is going to come to religion and brother R said he quotes Joe okay now let's get back to the original quote that was 64 now I'm taking you back 61 the message of Grace so right after saying this may my words be engraved in stone and sent to All Nations brother BR says and look at this six we're 59 years after brother brandom and all these nations are still getting his tapes there's so many languages uh the voice of God Recordings has not translated the message into so there's many people so that haven't heard the message yeah right so brother Ram had quite a statement there now he goes to this story story now he's going to tell a story about an experience he had 7 days ago from this sermon it would have been uh August 25th 1961 last year as all of you know he says there was spoken into existence Three Squirrels he says um and then brother BR said you know he said last week I had a strange feeling to go to that same place again where he was hunting MH and it was before daylight rain I didn't even know whether there' be a hunt or not because of the rain hunting means and he says hunting means to get alone to yourself and pray Hallelujah so see that's what you want you want your uh you want your hobbies to somehow connect you to God praise God like I went through our Hobbies on Sunday a little bit and I'm glad at the beginning of our Hobbies we got to hear a lot of good Jesus talk not so much anymore but we always pray before our Hobbies amen Malachi and I before we go into practice we always pray together in join hands and pray in the car God would protect our bodies and protect our minds brother said I stopped the car and walked across the road and went into the bush it was just before daylight it was kind of gray I had stopped now look so brother before he would hunt he'd stop and he said I offered a little word of prayer as usual telling father that just what I have need of to provide it I don't believe in wasting anything or destroying so so you know it's it's maybe 6:00 a.m. in the morning brother's going out to hunt and what does he always do he always stops to offer a little word of prayer can you see brother r with is hunting his cowboy hat on take off his hat and say father I I pray you just provide what I have need of this morning amen hallelujah and then as I turned so he puts his hat on as I turned I started doing along a little familiar little pathway by the side of the pasture over to an L shape in the woods and something strange took place all my experience is I've never had anything like that I looked at the top of the hill to my left from where I was standing now one of these days if you any of you guys are good at picture AI anybody ever make a picture with AI I've never done it all right I'm going to have to send you this quote and you can make a picture with it we'll put it up there on Sunday well not Sunday next Wednesday I thought Bo this brother I love brother always describes these things so well I like to just input that into the AI and see what it see what it pops out there so brother looks up the hill and he sees at the hill he says came three rainbows and they were running some 30 feet high so picture 30t High three rainbows first I look I seen the light and I just turned back because I thought it might be the sun raising upon the second thought it wasn't towards the sun it was towards the South another thing it was smooth cloudy rain raining all over that was August 25th last Friday morning and you know it was raining and I looked again and there it was growing taller and taller three rain I took off my hat I sat down my gun I love this brother is trying to do a hobby but he gets an experience with God I think that's a good lesson we should be able to experience God while doing our Hobbies Hallelujah he said I starting walking towards it with my hands up so he starts walking towards the hill with his hands up and something just seemed to tell me this is close enough I was going to sit down and take off my boots that I had on to see if I could walk a little closer but within a few yards of it I seen the color of it missing like a fog moving around I Stood Still for a few moments it was coming right out right out of the top of the little mountain and I watch as a three he says one to the right one to the left one in the center running down into one bowl like so all three will kind of come into like a bowl he says I like to see what AI thinks of that Hallelujah everyone it was was alive and it was moving and making its MO and I stood there just as it was graying down I turned and looked again and I screamed out oh God what would you have your servant to know hallelujah amen just then the spirit of the Lord come in and said Jesus of the New Testament is Jehovah of the old yeah he only chased his mask from Spirit to man Amen brother tells about the experience the rest of his life the rest of his life that was confirming of course my message of him what's the message of him that God is one person not three not three people let and I love this God's letting me know he assured that these 31 years of ministry hasn't been in vain hallelujah praise God I'm really grateful that God encourage you encourages you on the way and lets you know your life has not been in vain amen remember brotherr wasn't getting more popular at this time he was getting less popular right right because he was taking a stand on serpent seat on the Oneness of God uh one person uh no women preachers the Lord Jesus Christ baptism he was getting less and less invitations less and less po popular so God comes and shows him a sign that he's still with him and it's confirming the godhead Ministry I love it three rainbows three manifestations going into one bowl amen one person hallelujah amen so the vision came to confirm his ministry wasn't in vain amen hallelujah and that's why you know we had I had that little experience where I I was uh praying about our church and I had the dream of brother bradam and then I had Brother Ray come and give me a confirmation I believe that's my own simple way where God gave me strength to continue in my Ministry to encourage me to show a confirmation to give me some assurance that God's with me hallelujah amen amen it's a vision of the godhead it's a vision of a covenant because a rainbow is a covenant glory and church this reminds us that your labor is not in vain God will give us experiences to encourage us that our labor is not in vain you'll see it in fruits in your life right the love the joy the peace the gentleness the faithfulness the temperance Temperance we preach on that on Sunday amen if you if you see yourself living a healthier life you can see the fruit of of of the Holy Spirit hallelujah amen that's just a simple connection to Sunday's messages see God's going to give you healings and testimonies like brother Phil like the The Nine Pages I'm going to take this down to Kentucky so they can see it too by God's grace I don't want to lose this so they can see that no matter how long the list of of of of threats against you is or or the list of symptoms God greater than symptoms amen hallelujah imagine imagine having nine pages of of of you know just fearful things nine these are all things you could die from you know nine pages of all these symptoms but they can be wiped away in just a matter of days praise God Amen because God is merciful because God is faithful Hallelujah and then our sister Melinda being healed of that static nerve trouble you know God and I write these down church I try to do my best to write down the testimonies that we have by God's grace cuz God's giving us assurance that he's with us praise God and God cannot fail his Covenant hallelujah amen God will not make a promise to you to save us with his love and then take it away it's impossible for God to lie right how's everybody feeling everybody feeling okay amen the word vain means empty or profitless right God was showing brother random your ministry is not empty right your ministry is not profitless in other words it's gained something it has profit to it there there there's fruits to it amen hallelujah there's a blessing to the ministry of the Bible the bible-based ministry of God's Prophet hallelujah amen amen and especially you know just on this topic of the Bible translations I'm not going to spend much time on it but you I can easily see now how Satan you know there's only two paths to a new Bible right or there's only two paths to a Bible either the King James path with those Scrolls or the other path and all the other Bibles are made from the other path right with incomplete uh scrolls with corrupted scrolls with uh sometimes 7 10 15 20% of the words of the King James missing and God said you're guilty if you take one word away not 10% or 20% but just one word away yeah and then to see how there're it's attacking the the the the true Bible doctrine that Jesus first gave to St Paul and then it was lost but it had to be restored by Luther Wesley brother brandom hallelujah amen now if you want to throw a see more in there you can do that too by God's grace because his ministry helped bring back the understanding of the gifts of the holy spirit amen but remember Church your labor of love is not in vain our worship is not in vain because we don't teach doctrines of men as Jesus said in Matthew 159 but in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men Paul says if you've uh got Grace then then Grace he says is bestowed on us and he Paul said about him it was not bestowed on me in vain but I labored more abundantly than they all yet not I but the grace of God which was with me amen so how do we know Grace is is accomplishing something because we continue to labor we continue to press on we refuse to give up Hallelujah no matter what friends or family or whatever media might say we don't give up we keep pressing on we keep laboring for the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah that's how you know it's not in vain because you see grace working in your life what's causing you to do this grace is causing me to do this what's causing you to keep singing and keep worshiping and praying and reading your Bible and fasting what's causing you to do that God's grace is doing that Hallelujah now remember Church you know this is one thing the the churches Miss they miss that people can fail the grace of God right I believe that's Hebrews 12 let me uh type that in there real quick that's what I didn't have written down yeah Hebrews 12:15 we looked at that on Esau earlier this year remember looking diligently lest any man fail the grace of God fail there in the Greek it means uh to come behind to be destitute to fall to suffer need okay Les and now how how do they fail Grace by a root of bitterness springing up and trouble you and thereby many be defiled so see we got to be real careful to keep our hearts pure we can't let bitterness come into our lives amen the Bible said you can fail great if you become bitter right think about that think of how many friends you have they're bitter against their dad or their mom I mean some of us could have excuses to do that if we wanted to but we have to forgive amen as we've been forgiven we must extend forgiveness that's what brother Brooks preached amen remember that one Hallelujah and then Paul said you know people can receive God's grace in vain 2 Corinthians 61 we then as workers together with him beseech you also that you receive not the grace of God in vain he he's begging them don't receive God's grace in vain in other words don't let it come into your life and then forget about it let Grace have an impact on you amen see you know I you know like I told you this many times but just as a refresher I could have Grace on my father because I I had accepted God's grace amen right so if youve received Grace and I I I know I've sinned against God way more than my dad sinned against me so if I if I know Jesus forgave me of that much surely I can forgive God or my dad or any person surely I can forgive them of the few things they've done against me amen hallelujah amen that's right so see grace must be effective we must we must let Grace work within us praise God remember Paul was Afra when the Galatians adopted circumcision back in Paul said I'm afraid of you lest I bestowed upon you labor in vain yeah see then that goes to say sometimes church we don't know who's saved and who's not we don't know who's got the Holy Ghost and who doesn't right because Paul says you are you've adopted circumcision you've adopted legalism I'm afraid that my my labor was in vain yeah God doesn't want us to adopt legalism God wants us to keep the commands of God hallelujah amen not a man-made righteousness not a righteousness which is made by you and I so we feel good or we feel holier than the other Church down the road right or the message Church in the next city you know whatever may be be we're not competing against man we're competing against the sin that's within us praise God Amen Hallelujah now here's another way Paul says you know your life isn't in vain Philippians 2:14 do all things without murmurings and disputings so see how we got we got uh bitterness murmuring which is complaining and disputing these three things are really the same thing right right mhm as far as it's just sin it's speaking the wrong thing it's holding things against people yeah and Paul's going to say in verse 15 and 16 that ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation among whom ye shine as lights in the world you are the light of the world hallelujah amen well let's do it with blamelessness let's be harmless praise God verse 16 holding forth the word of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I've not run in vain neither labored in vain so he says it again like Hebrews 12 and now Philippians 2 and then Galatians chapter 4 if people adopt bitterness they can fall away uh you know of course it would destroy their soul right that would mean they were never born again right murmurings disputings uh all these things could cause people uh to have labored in vain Hallelujah and church you know we we serve God because we love God hallelujah amen am and you know I would just say this too for myself like I want my life to show that brother Brooks and brother Craig and all the preachers that taught me brother Samuel that their labor was not in vain amen you understand amen when I was a young Christian people swed a lot into my life but I want to live a way where in such a way so much like Christ where people can say oh my labor with brother Jesse wasn't in vain amen amen cuz I still hold the gospel amen that's what I want look at your lives and see that that my labor as a pastor was fruitful hallelujah amen how many can say Amen to that Hallelujah Paul says it even with the the Thessalonians remember this was a church where they had a lot of lazy men that wouldn't work Paul had to dress it twice Paul said they had busybody women that walk around and just talk all day men that wouldn't work and he said if you don't work you don't eat see how there's different kinds of churches the Corinthian Church was a little more sensual but they had all these gifts the Ephesian church was this we always hear about the Ephesian Faith right this was this mature church but remember they fell away within 20 years of Paul's letter yeah they'd Fallen away or maybe they moved out or got killed I don't know all the details but the church was over within a matter of years but Paul tells the Thessalonians he told them in 1 Thessalonians 3:4 that they should suffer pers or tribulation and then in verse 5 he says for this cause when I could no longer forbear i s to know your faith so Paul knew they were being persecuted and he sent somebody to see how are they doing ever notice somebody that's a little older than you that knew the message before you ever notice when they check up on you brother Brian Hawkins does that to me he checks up on me because he's been serving God a little longer than me right and then that's you know he also we've had it before too where when he checks up on me I was just going to text him to to come preach so we we've seen God do that numerous times just when he's thinking about me checking up on me I'm checking up on him but Paul says I want I sent to know your faith lest perhaps by some means the tempter have tempted you and our labor was in vain yeah so you see sometimes church we just wonder you know people we poured Our Lives into it's okay to check up on them and see how are they doing that's a normal thing to do and it might be the Holy Spirit prompting you to do that so you can encourage them amen amen even this week I put out numerous YouTube videos and people would said right away I was just asking that question I was just struggling with that and it came at the right time brother Jesse now if you would have asked me brother Jesse do you feel letter the Lord at this time to make this I would have said I I'm just working I'm I'm just inspired by this thought but then it's awesome to see how God can take that and send it whether it's across the nation or across the world and God can minister to somebody who needs it at that moment praise God Amen in fact one of the testimonies was his wonderful brother he's probably listening here but he does Prison Ministry mhm anyone here ever done any pron prison ministry that's quite a servant I told him you're a real servant of God when you can go into the prison like that risk your life he said you're a real servant like that that's you don't do for money and he said some days he's so tired and he's got you know physical problems he can can't even get out of bed but he'll try to get out of bed to go minister to these prisoners but he said uh he said brother Jesse your video you put out this week about endless genealogies I don't know if you saw that or uh avoiding vain babblings he said I needed that because there's these prisoners that just want to argue with me and I just asked God lord when do I stop answering all their endless questions and as soon as he prayed that God had me do that video I don't know I just know God's in I just know God's in control God's word will never return void Hallelujah so see Church you know Paul Paul was aware the tempter can come by and snatch the word out of people's hearts amen right now we know God can never or we know Satan will never snatch the word out of our souls but he can snatch it out of our minds sure how many ever had a real good thought then you lost it happens to me all the time that's why I always try to have a phone or somewhere nearby to write down you know as soon as it comes but you know what happens many times for us maybe we're just forgetful because of all the the dings and the notifications we're getting but the tempter takes it away when we give into the wrong thought we choose to think the wrong thought say the wrong word right that's when the tempter may come by he may snatch a freshly swed word out of our minds amen hallelujah but Paul said I wanted to know how your faith was lest the tempter had tempted you that's scripture Luke 8:12 says uh there the seed that was swn by the wayside and then cometh the devil taketh away the word out of their hearts remember that yeah MH so see Satan can snatch words out of people's heart and then Satan can also put lies in their minds like John 13:2 and supper being ended the devil having now put in the heart of judas's Scar Satan's son I'm sorry I'm sorry Simon's son to betray him so Satan snatched the word out of judas's heart and he put his lie to betray him in his heart yeah but Judas had to do it amen aren't you glad Satan's got to get permission for everything that he does amen and God won't give you something you can't handle hallelujah amen and I love what the Bible shows us out of that that um that King aimc if you got Integrity in your heart and if you don't want to sin against God God will keep you from sinning against him amen oh there it is right there amen hallelujah if you don't want to sin God will give you Grace to not sin hallelujah amen oh it's beautiful if you don't want that word getting stat out of your mind then God will protect that word hallelujah hallelujah amen glory remember also James 1:26 and I'll get back to this story from Brother brandham If any man seem to to be religious now religion is a good word unless it's a sinful religion or man-made religion religion just means Pious or devoted or disciplined If any man seem to be religious and brid not his tongue but deceives his own heart this man's religion is vain amen so I've told this to many people we Austin and I talked about it when he first come back if anybody and all of our friends too if any of our friends are cussing it shows their religion is not in vain they just don't have a if they tell dirty jokes their religion isn't real yet right that's what the Bible says their religion is fruitless there's no profit to going to church or singing the music or whatever they download whatever sermons or music download if they tell dirty jokes if they say cuss words if if they curse people the religion has not taken a hold on them amen hallelujah you'd be surprised how many people say they're Christians and say they're allowed to cuss it's impossible the Bible said they deceive their own Hearts but if you ask them they say oh I'm saved I'm saved and they they can be so convincing but the Bible says they're deceived I'm going to believe the Bible every time Hallelujah remember it's coming down it's so close it may deceive the very elect if it were possible amen hallelujah Glory now let's get back to this uh this experience brother Ram said I as I started to approach the three rainbows it began to go away and went down into this bow-like affair and then it disappeared is he got closer or just kind of went down into the bowl and then disappeared I walked up close I was afraid to go any closer because he had stopped me before I got there I turned and noticed that light the way it was shining for me was just exactly in line with the tree where I sat last year where the squirrels appeared somehow the light that was remaining directed him to the same tree he was standing by when he spoke squirrels into existence some 35 or 40 minutes later I went down through the woods and over the creek bottoms and so forth till I got to this tree that separates the four directions north south east and west and I climbed into this prong and sat down where I was when he told me that scripture if you say to this mountain be moved how many remember that that's the perfect Faith scripture Hallelujah the perfect Faith scripture is Mark 11 I believe it's 23 and 24 if you say to this mountain and don't doubt in your heart you can have what you asked for amen hallelujah and I stood there a little bit not thinking yet of the rainbow it had left my mind so he already walked a little bit and forgotten about that I stood there and this has been a very bad year year for squirrel hunting everything is late no squirrels now you might be wondering what does squirrels have to do with this well it's the speaking the speaking uh to the mountain right speaking to your need right zuub had to speak to the need I need to finish this Temple yeah think about that they built the Altar for sacrifice they built the church they started the church but they I'm sorry they laid the foundation but they never got the church finished and what did God say speak to the mountain amen hallelujah amen hallelujah so we can do that right we can do it with any mountain in our way right talk about job situations you can speak to the job situation amen amen if God leads you to do it right Hallelujah I remember that one time may maybe you remember me telling you this my grandpa before he died he was in Toledo and my mom said you better come see him it was right before I was leaving on some trip I can't remember where and I was in our Kia Sadona that that kadona that that gold K kadona and I'm driving right through uh I drove right through Seville there right near doy toown and church this storm was one of the blackest grayest storms I'd ever seen and it was pouring down and I'm I'm I think there was a warning on my phone like a tornado warning and I just listen to brother Ram say speak to the storm I put my head out that window and it's it's rain I went all by myself so God's my witness I put my face out the window and rain's coming down my face I said I speak to this storm in the name of Jesus Christ I've got to get to my grandpa to see him before he dies and just within a matter of minutes it all calmed down and I got through it amen now I'm not you know I'm not saying I saw something I'm just saying I just spoke the word of God and you know God might have worked it out where I just drove through or it might have been something Supernatural now I believe it's something Supernatural amen but the point is when we see an obstacle if we're led by God we can speak to that mountain Hallelujah am and then I was telling brother cam you know we were talking Moses would speak Moses would get was permissioned by God speak and flies will come fleas right right Darkness amen speak he just said speak it and it came forth praise God so see we can speak to a mountain we can speak God's word we can speak I'll say like this may we speak God's grace to People Too Hallelujah Glory said you know I thought right here is where God gave me them squirrels last year to speak into existence because this is speak to your Mountain I took off my hat again and I said Lord God you are still the same Jesus you are still God Amen and something said to me how many do you need this time and I said just as I did the other time the limit the state limit and then I said I shall have this limit before 10:00 today so now he speaking the word hallelujah he said then he said a big mosquito came to bite him right in the eye and I said not one of them will bother me this day no repellent or anything with me and before I knew it I said the sun will shine within 30 minutes and brother Bram goes on to say all three things he spoke came to pass he said exactly 30 minutes from that time the sun Shone round about and he said the mosquitoes Buzz all day long and I never got he said I never got stung by one of them Hallelujah brother man I want you to notice there was three rainbows there was three things I said Three Squirrels gotten right Three Squirrels by 10:00 no mosquitoes the sun would shine in 30 minutes and there was three witnesses to it brother Banks Woods my son Billy Paul and his son David gave witness to it so they must have saw the sun come out they must have saw some of the effects of what brother said they no doubt saw the squirrels he says and when I seen them rainbows about as white a cross as that Halo is that angel of the Lord but there were three of them running into one and how it helped my heart to know that God Jesus is not just a man as people think he is just a prophet as this modern idea today thinks that Jesus is just a prophet he's Jehovah of the Old Testament made flesh and dwelt Among Us and there that sure did comfort me am praise God hallelujah see Church you develop uh we we we develop you know persecution opposition sometimes we develop doubt and frustrations brother random called frustrations in life but we just stay with what God has showed us we stay with the word of God and God will give us a comfort at the right time amen amen hallelujah I remember you know when brother Mike chister he was here last week I remember when we went up to Maine it was probably 2010 or 2008 or 2009 somewhere around there we just went up this real small Church up in Rhode Island no I'm sorry Maine not rhod Island Maine just a tiny Church a lot like this church maybe smaller by God's grace and I'm like why in the world would brother Mike feel led to bring me up here and we flew on one of those real small what they call the biplanes with the two little propellers on the front I thought I was going to die that night because it was raining and storming and lightning and everything we I was shaking like a leaf in that we were both shaking because there was all this turbulence flying out to Maine but I got there and I just preached a simple message and and the pastor's sister come up afterwards and with tears in her eyes she shook my hand her face is red she said brother Jesse thank you for preaching here I will never be the same amen and the last time I talked to his uh s sorry talked to her uh brother she's doing great in the message by God's grace amen you know just confirmations God you know Mike felt led to go there that's where he danced that Holy Ghost jig in the middle of the airport Boston's Airport at 12:30 a.m. then we had to get up at 6:00 a.m. to make the flight so we probably got 3 hours of sleep that night and he thought he lo you know we thought they lost his uh luggage and they said oh we found it I remember it come rolling right there she oh he's like there it is he see see him he's like hallelujah thank you Jesus he said oh praise God you know how he is and he just could praise God at 12 :30 in the morning I'm just stand there laughing like Hallelujah this guy really loved Jesus I love it and so see God is trying to comfort Us by hearing our prayers and giving us experiences with the Lord hallelujah amen now brother Ram he looks at this Vision rainbows and now he brings in the Oneness and the trinitarians he says there's a group of people call themselves Oneness or Jesus only I don't agree with on their Theory so don't let anybody ever tell you you're a Oneness Pentecostal you're not right they do Jesus only baptism We Do Lord Jesus Christ amen they say God is one like your finger he's not right because Jesus the body of Jesus did not create itself the spirit had to create it right so that's a great difference there Jesus the body could not create itself it had to have a Creator right that's why Jesus said I go to my God and your God Jesus said I'm going to the creator that created this body I'm going back to the spirit that's in me but also there in heaven MH Hallelujah he says I don't agree with them on their Theory neither do I agree with the trinitarian group that says there are three different gods the extreme of the trinitarian see some trinitarians are really extreme on that some are not so extreme but either way they add to the word of God and plagues will be added to them if they don't repent right the people that made these doctrines and push these doctrines they know better I'm not talking about ignorant people God can forgive ignorance God can wink at ignorance but God doesn't wink at people that purposely add to the word of God Amen that's why the Bible said preachers will be judged more harshly than others I'll be judged more harshly these people that write these books and these doctorates and pH modern day Pharisees and everything they'll be judged more harshly because they knew more of the word of God they spent more time in the word of God hallelujah I'm glad to preach the Full Gospel by God's grac amen he says but I believe that the three father son Holy Ghost is one that they are three offices of one God God lived in the fatherhood in the pillar of fire he lived in the sunship in Jesus Christ and he now lives in the Holy Ghost in his church the same Lord Jesus that was made flesh and dwelt Among Us is with us today Among Us in the form of the holy spirit amen hallelujah of all the experiences when I turned and first saw it thinking first it must be the sun peep through the cloud somewhere but it was before Sun time and then I seen it wasn't a light it was rainbows and I looked I became numb all over mhm just someone said to me did you feel like shouting they asked brother the BR did you feel like shouting when you saw those three rainbows no I didn't feel like shouting said those experiences never make you feel like shouting they just make you feel anchored amen hallelujah amen and brother man talks about this in other places he said there's anointing for for bubble dancing like we like to We Like to Dance For Joy right brother said that's that's the anointing of the Holy Ghost he said but then there's a fearful anointing where you feel like you might die in the presence of God both are anointings right we want to experience both of them right the reverence the severity of God this the power of God but we also want to have the joy of the Lord amen and brother Adam says you know this was not one of those times where I felt like shouting and he says bubble dancing this is the time I felt anchored like God loved me amen that God was with me that God came to comfort me God came to give me assurance that I'm his true servant amen am Glory what an anchor for the soul that's why God I think had to you know when I first started preaching God had to give me such an answer to prayer when I first started preaching I needed to be anchored that I was called to preach because look at the times we got to go through right Hallelujah y look at the times you have to go through as a Christian look at the times we here her here are in 2024 right the tests and trials we had to go through these last few years you see people falling away you know that's that's prophecy right the latter days many shall depart from the faith amen right some of our closest friends you know my wife and I some of our our dearest friends Falling Away y but see God had to give me an anchor remember my testimony I was going to preach brother the brookses for the first time it was January 2004 20 years ago and I fasted one or two days before that and brother Brooks had me preach the p.m. service the 3 p.m. service not the 10:00 a.m. the 3 p.m. and I spent my whole time back there and I was shaking like a leaf before I went out I thought I was going to die cuz I was fasting that day my ribs were hurting and I was just shaking under the I felt the anointing of God I was just weeping and crying and as soon as I went out there to preach sister Karen Sanders gave a word and it was uh like a word of knowledge it kind of told what I was going to preach and as soon as that happened I was totally relaxed I preached at that church and maybe there was 70 people there I don't know 50 but after that sermon everybody came to the altar was weeping and repenting and I went around praying for every single person at the altar there I needed an experience to Anchor me because I knew tough or God knew tough times were coming praise God Amen the same thing happened at uh North Carolina I don't mean to point at you buddy you saw it when brother I went to Tim Humes in 2017 the New Year's Eve service same thing happened I preach and then the whole church except for a few people in the back you know they got kids up at the altar weeping and crying seeking God now some of them received something there that day some of them didn't half of them the church split right half sa the message half left and then the ones that left their Church split so the group that left the message their Church split one me went one Church went more worldly and one Church kind of stayed with the oldfashioned Holiness dress see you give Satan an inch he'll take a mile see first they said well brother is not a prophet well then well then then we can wear whatever clothes we want we can wear sexy clothes we can wear makeup we can cut our hair that's what happened yeah but another group has to stay with the Holiness standards amen look at that see let's just let's make sure our word the Bible is our absolute praise God Amen let's make that the absolute Hallelujah does that make you feel like shouting brother r No it makes me feel anchored just where that you know there's something that tells you just a satisfied feeling praise God Amen or don't you enjoy those moments where you're just satisfied I'm satisfied here in the presence of God Amen Hallelujah this anchors me this gives me an experience that I needed praise God Amen a lot of you girls got that at that Napoleon meeting in April 2023 I was go back there that's an anchoring meeting right that that anchored you in that God is real and that God's spirit can just fall in a place Hallelujah when the conditions are met Glory when we're in one place and one Accord the Holy Ghost can fall hallelujah amen amen remember there was just so you know there was over five hours of prayer meetings just for that that weekend of meetings extra prayer not prayer just before service even extra prayer on top of that brother said those things are true so with the rainbows the bow Jehovah the old is Jesus Christ the new he says those things are true I know we have things that's said and many times people say well I don't believe in such a stuff as that I can't voucher for that I don't know I can only voucher for what I know is to be truth and God Almighty who wrote this Bible and I'm his servant he knows that that is the truth amen think of it that the day that we're living in just before the coming of the Lord Jesus said there'll be signs in the skies in the earth great sides flying saucers missiles perplex of time distress between the Nations and fearful sights upon the Earth and we're living in that day to see those things y so brother says you know this experience was foretold in the Bible Jesus said in Luke 21:11 and great earthquakes shall be in diverse places places and famines and pestilences and fearful sights and Great Signs shall be there from the heaven hallelujah amen amen Great Signs God places in the heavens he gave some to brother random Hallelujah what a what an experience praise God so church I'm hoping you hoping you see in this message of Grace God shows him Grace God shows him the Covenant because a rainbow represents a covenant I'm with you and I'm giving you Assurance what you preached is right brother Austin it's a good feeling when I can say what I preached is Right In Here by God's grace it's a great feeling brother now it's a good feeling when I know when someone challenged me on something I can say it's right there in the Bible y you can say whatever you want but the word of God Is Right hallelujah amen it's easier for this world to pass away than for one of these words to pass away hallelujah amen it's forever settled in heaven Hallelujah there's some record of this in heaven where it's absolutely right every word of God is yay and amen God's word are purified seven times in the fire hallelujah amen Amen brother said it was my desire to tell you of these things he said many times things happen and I don't speak of it I don't say it but this was too outstanding for me to keep it from the church it must be told and before God who I stand it's the truth I know that there's a God and I know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God Emmanuel dwelling amongst his people today in the form of the Holy Spirit and I know that the coming Lord is drawing nigh when signs and wonders are appearing Hallelujah to think of it I was thinking of that Grace immediately after that that Friday morning just a break of the day up there in that field when I sat on a log later tears come down my eyes I said oh God Your Grace has stooped to save me amen so think he has this experience he doesn't go dancing up to the church he sits on a log and starts crying God has been so good to me amen glory see when God moves for us it shouldn't make us proud and should make us humble praise God Amen he gets to hear the voice of God he gets to see three rainbows and he sits down and says oh God Your Grace has stooped to save me why did you ever have such pity on a poor illiterate Wretch like Me amen right and all these preachers today call themselves such great the greatest of all time and the greatest Pastor in the world and all the and it just shows they haven't had enough experiences with God amen amen CU When you have experience with God it doesn't make you proud it makes you humble amen how did you ever come down to our little humble Tabernacle here I could say this same how did God ever come down to little akan Ohio in a small little church like ours where peace and people of low Walk of Life poor have nothing in this world and still your grace is spread abroad in our hearts amen got anybody poor here got anybody that's a low Walk of Life in here nothing of this world to brag about anybody got any mansions to brag about or Mercedes Benz or something like that any 20200 or 2024 Mustangs anybody got any that to brag about just poor poor humble loow lives we'd say like I've had numerous churches laugh at me when I go there and they hear I'm a first grade teacher the the sisters ago I like what Simon said one time when he preached it you know over there he said to think you know he said I've got eternal life and I'm trying to show these people the the the revelation of Jesus Christ and then my boss I can't even remember the the measurement he told me five minutes earlier I got it remember said that it made me cry I thought look how low of life I am look look what a low place in life I am you know not nothing great in this world and yet you and I I'm a carrier carrier of eternal life I you and I are ambassadors of Heaven Heaven amen Heaven amen Heaven has sent you to be an ambassador trying to bring reconciliation to someone and yet it's so humble it's it's it's so pitiful just a low Walk of Life poor now we got some we we're not illiterate all of you can read the Bible by God's grace right so we have some some blessings in our life for sure but brother ad says see I have nothing in this world and still your grace is spread Upon Our Hearts by the holy spirit that you heal our sicknesses and save us from our sins and you make us your people and deal with us why did you ever make me your people and deal with us that's what this experience has made brother Ram think the grace of God had appeared to him and it made him grateful Hallelujah and church I'm close with this this reminds us I lost track of time forgive me this reminds us here three rainbows reminds us of the rainbow in Revelation 10 right Jesus comes down as a mighty Angel brother Ram said this is history already the angel came down with a rainbow over his head and gave the open book to brother Brandon so we see a rainbow connected to brother Ram's Ministry and here he has three rainbows the godhead amen and then Jesus comes down with a rainbow over his head a covenant reminding him of the Covenant of the New Testament like our brother Paul preached here on the the new the New Covenant by God's grace y hallelujah amen so we see a connection and remember the mighty Angel come down what he under what what did he utter seven Thunders amen amen hallelujah and gave the open book to brother brandham but here we see God's Covenant was also with this seventh Church age messenger hallelujah amen how many know that the Bible said we're under the blood of a New Covenant right we just heard it preached by Brother Paul the Bible says in Hebrews 13 now the God of Peace that brought again from the dead our lord Jesus that great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the Everlasting Covenant make you perfect and every good work amen think about that what's going to make you perfect in the good works the blood of the Covenant amen am amen what well hasn't that blood already been shed yes that's the glory of it amen amen in other words the blood that's been shed is going to accomplish what God wants to accomplish in your life amen it's already purchased the the power for you to do the works that God has called for you oh hallelujah amen the blood of the Covenant will make you perfect in every good work to do his will amen working in you that that which is well pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ to be glory forever and ever amen amen so see the blood connects you to the Covenant and that Covenant blood will confirm that you're doing the perfect will of God Amen in other words the holy spirit will help you see amen it will assure you it will comfort you it will give you Vindication that you're doing the will of God God hallelujah amen just like it did Brother Brenham it came to encourage him at a time where he wasn't more popular less popular all men were forsaking him right most men were forsaking him and God gave that experience to encourage him and the blood of the Covenant made brother Ram perfect in every good work to do the will of God hallelujah and God's grace was with him let's stand to our feet musician Mal can come by God's grace what a blessing to know church that God keeps his covenants how many thankful for the Covenant of Grace amen this is just the beginning we'll go through it brother BR has many wonderful quotes on God's grace as I said I've listened to this numerous times there's lots of highlights I just thought it was so striking you know I've never just listened to this message with an intent to preach it to preach all the parts of it so it meant a lot to to me to see how God would give brother brandom experiences to Anchor him how many want to be anchored in Christ amen that's what we want tonight a church you might need an experience with God I don't know what you need tonight I don't know what you're going through but I know this is God's word and the blood of the Covenant will make you perfect in every
