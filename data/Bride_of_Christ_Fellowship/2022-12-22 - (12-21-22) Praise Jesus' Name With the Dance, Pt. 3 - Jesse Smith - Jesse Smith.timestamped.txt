[0:21] I want to cover the ones I haven't
[0:23] covered as much by God's grace so just a
[0:27] quick review you know we found that the

[1:42] the message right we don't want to be
[1:44] prisoners of the enemy right we're
[1:46] supposed to be in the message of the
[1:47] hour right we're supposed to be in the
[1:49] in the most uh fresh revelation of the
[1:52] word of God there is praise God and we
[1:53] are praise God and we don't want to be
[1:55] chained up we don't want to be prisoners

[2:18] Jesus oh I love what the word of God
[2:19] gives us hallelujah
[2:22] be joyful in glory the Bible says
[2:24] hallelujah be joyful in the name of the
[2:26] Lord praise God
[2:29] so you know we reviewed a lot you know
[2:31] it's one one point I want to make you
[2:32] know brother Ray and I were texting
[2:33] about it today so it's nice to see
[2:34] brother Ray again to David you know
[2:36] dancing started with the logos
[2:39] dancing started with the Holy Spirit in
[2:41] Proverbs chapter 8 verse 30 and 31.
[2:44] the Bible said the Holy Spirit danced or
[2:47] played before the almighty invisible God
[2:50] so our my dance didn't start when I got
[2:53] saved my dance actually came from the
[2:57] Sun Hallelujah and the fact that I dance
[2:59] proves I am one of those Sons Hallelujah
[3:02] I'm a Son of God hallelujah you're a
[3:04] daughter of God hallelujah
[3:06] amen because where'd you get that praise
[3:09] from you got it from Christ amen
[3:11] that's the anointing praise God and the
[3:13] anointing breaks the yolks hallelujah
[3:15] thank you Jesus Hallelujah so when we're
[3:18] struggling or something like that we
[3:19] need a fresh breakthrough right we need
[3:21] a fresh Revelation a fresh anointing
[3:23] praise God a fresh Revival praise God
[3:26] hallelujah we need that and God is
[3:29] gracious to give it to us hallelujah
[3:30] because he's rich in Mercy amen
[3:32] hallelujah
[3:34] now
[3:35] I want to look at uh
[3:37] a couple more here by God's grace let's
[3:39] go back to
[3:41] first Samuel 18. if you got your Bibles
[3:43] there first Samuel 18
[3:48] familiar passage you know for those of
[3:50] us who watch David of course this summer
[3:52] you know what a wonderful uh show that
[3:54] is by God's grace but first Samuel 1817
[4:08] now of course here this is the chapter
[4:10] right after Goliath went down so Goliath
[4:13] went down in chapter 17 and now chapter
[4:16] 18 is shortly thereafter right Saul uh
[4:20] he asked who was this young man that did
[4:22] that he'd forgot about all the all the
[4:24] Holy Ghost worship David gave him you
[4:25] know because he was I had all those evil
[4:27] spirits on him right
[4:29] but uh then the women start singing
[4:32] about David's victory right and it made
[4:35] Saul jealous
[4:37] right but verse 17 or yeah verse
[4:40] 18 17.
[4:43] and Saul said to David behold my elder
[4:45] daughter marib
[4:46] her will I give thee to wife only be
[4:48] thou Valiant for me and fight the Lord's
[4:50] battles for Saul said let not thine hand
[4:53] mind hand be upon him but let the hand
[4:55] of the Philistines be upon him
[4:59] okay I read the wrong one
[5:00] first Samuel 18.
[5:09] okay I'm sorry I wrote down the wrong
[5:11] scripture
[5:14] oh yeah verse six yeah six and seven
[5:17] sorry I wrote the wrong one six six and
[5:18] seven sorry and it came to pass as they
[5:21] came when David was returned from the
[5:22] slaughter of the Philistine that the
[5:24] women came out of all cities of Israel
[5:26] singing and dancing to meet King Saul
[5:29] with tablets with joy and with
[5:31] instruments of music and the women
[5:33] answered one another as they played and
[5:35] said Saul has slain his thousands and
[5:38] David is ten thousands
[5:41] so here we can see Into the Heart of
[5:42] Saul why he starts getting jealous he
[5:45] comes in and he's met with his people
[5:47] but they're not singing his Praises
[5:49] they're singing David's praises
[5:52] right and so uh instantly you know he
[5:54] gets jealous and and so Saul you know he
[5:57] starts going after Dave the Bible said
[5:58] he item from that day forth right
[6:01] he got all jealous but the Bible said
[6:03] the women were out there dancing they
[6:04] were praising the Lord they were singing
[6:06] saw us slain as thousands David is ten
[6:08] thousands hallelujah amen George what do
[6:11] we see when Giants fall the people
[6:13] Rejoice praise God
[6:15] Hallelujah and when you see a giant in
[6:18] your life or can say like this a
[6:19] mountain when you see a mountain move in
[6:21] your life that is time to Rejoice praise
[6:23] God
[6:24] Hallelujah that's what children of God
[6:27] do you know they struggle for years
[6:28] think about the years of struggle they
[6:30] were under Philistine rule they were
[6:32] under Philistine bondage
[6:34] right for years and years and years
[6:36] they're under that bondage and finally a
[6:38] mighty conqueror amen comes along and
[6:41] slays a giant praise God and it makes
[6:43] the people rejoice it gives them a new
[6:45] song Amen Hallelujah gives them Victory
[6:47] Hallelujah and to make some people dance
[6:50] and sing praise God Amen because giant
[6:52] small church if mountains move then it's
[6:54] time to praise God hallelujah but let's
[6:56] keep fighting until the giant Falls
[6:58] praise God
[7:00] keep fighting praise God because there
[7:01] is a time and season for all things
[7:04] there's a time to mourn there's a time
[7:06] to dance thank God there's a time to
[7:07] dance thank God Victory is coming
[7:09] Victory is Victory is ahead the Bible
[7:12] said through the blood of Jesus
[7:13] victories ahead praise God
[7:15] oh hallelujah it's beautiful
[7:19] think about the change you were under as
[7:21] a sinner right or you know each one of
[7:23] us the Bible said all have fallen short
[7:26] of the glory of God
[7:27] all of us now one of us have ever you
[7:31] know lived perfectly before God we've
[7:34] all fallen short of the glory of God we
[7:36] all know what it's like to struggle we
[7:37] all know what it's like to sin we all
[7:39] know what it's like to be in bondage
[7:41] well when we get victory over that
[7:42] that's the time to Rejoice praise God
[7:44] that's the time to give God glory that's
[7:47] the time to shout the Praises of God
[7:49] Amen that's the time to give God thanks
[7:51] Hallelujah and the Bible Jesus said
[7:52] speak to that mountain and watch that
[7:54] mountain move amen
[7:56] but really Church the real moving has
[7:58] got to be done in our hearts
[8:00] right
[8:02] that's what really has to happen the
[8:04] moving's got to be done in our hearts
[8:06] praise God but random said prayer is not
[8:08] so much about uh changing the situations
[8:11] about changing our hearts
[8:14] right sometimes so many times we pray
[8:16] and God change this change that brother
[8:18] man says what really needs to happen is
[8:20] we need to have a change of heart
[8:22] because we may be suffering and enduring
[8:24] through things that God wants us to
[8:26] suffer endure through so we can learn a
[8:28] lesson
[8:29] Hallelujah
[8:31] but the point is church we keep praying
[8:33] we keep believing Jesus said speak to
[8:35] the mountain he said let my if my words
[8:37] abide in you and you abide in my word
[8:39] ask what you will and the father will do
[8:42] it praise God
[8:43] he didn't say when he didn't say how he
[8:45] just said he's going to do it praise God
[8:46] oh hallelujah how many seen him do it
[8:48] praise God
[8:49] amen hallelujah thank God so we see this
[8:53] dance came after the giant fell dance
[8:56] came after the mountain moved amen
[8:59] that's what we need praise God
[9:00] hallelujah thank God he gives us like
[9:03] that but remember church I said uh last
[9:05] or last Wednesday
[9:07] this victory was so great it spread over
[9:10] into King akish's land
[9:13] see so Sinners heard about this and
[9:16] church that's what we get when a
[9:17] mountain moves Sinners are going to hear
[9:19] about it praise God they're going to
[9:21] overhear your testimony overhear your
[9:22] conversation well the Lord did this to
[9:24] me Lord did that oh you believe in that
[9:26] absolutely I believe in that Jesus
[9:28] Christ manifested his presence God
[9:30] poured out his power how can I not
[9:32] testify praise God
[9:34] amen
[9:36] I wonder how many people I've told about
[9:37] my mom being here with cancer you know I
[9:39] wonder
[9:40] I wonder how many people we've testified
[9:41] to about uh all the victories God has
[9:44] given to us praise God they need to hear
[9:46] it praise God
[9:49] and so see the dance comes naturally
[9:51] when the mountain moves oh Hallelujah
[9:54] that's exactly right Church
[9:57] in memory Church it takes God's spirit
[9:59] to do that Psalm 22 verse 3 pray please
[10:02] let's read that Psalm 22 verse 3.
[10:06] remember brother man said he said David
[10:09] God looked down at David and said he
[10:11] said that's a man after my own heart he
[10:13] said because he done lost all his pride
[10:16] amen see church when we realize we're
[10:18] nothing we realize God just wants us to
[10:20] praise him praise God
[10:22] it doesn't matter what people say or
[10:24] people think or people feel none of that
[10:26] matters always what matters is what God
[10:27] thinks Hallelujah we want God to be
[10:30] pleased with how we act amen we want God
[10:32] to be pleased with our worship we want
[10:34] God to be glorified with our lives amen
[10:36] oh Hallelujah
[10:38] Psalm 22 3.
[10:45] I'm getting there there we go
[10:49] what a what a portion this is this is of
[10:52] course verse one is the cross of Jesus
[10:54] my God my God why is thou forsaken me
[10:56] verse 3.
[10:58] but Thou Art holy O Lord that inhabit us
[11:01] the Praises of Israel our fathers
[11:04] trusted in thee they trusted and thou
[11:06] just deliver them amen so what an
[11:08] encouragement church just keep praising
[11:10] God just keep trusting in God he will
[11:12] deliver
[11:14] that's who he is he is the god of
[11:16] Salvation he is the god of Miracles amen
[11:19] he is the god of faithfulness he's the
[11:22] god of of Deliverance he's a god of
[11:24] Salvation he's the god of power he's the
[11:26] god of strength not by our might or our
[11:28] power but by the Holy Spirit saith the
[11:30] Lord amen
[11:32] doesn't come down to our power our
[11:34] strength not our might not our power but
[11:36] by the Holy Spirit praise God
[11:38] and God dwells in the Praises of his
[11:40] people so the church we know when we're
[11:42] praising God God is well pleased
[11:45] oh Hallelujah
[11:48] yes now if you would let's go next here
[11:52] I want to go to second Samuel six
[11:54] hopefully I got this one wrote down
[11:56] right here
[11:57] second Samuel 6 5.
[12:04] now this back to David Danson Hallelujah
[12:06] when the art came back and got into its
[12:09] location the presence of God was back in
[12:11] the church Hallelujah second Corinthians
[12:14] I'm sorry second Samuel six sorry
[12:16] second Samuel 6.
[12:20] verse 5. now of course we know this was
[12:22] in the part where
[12:23] uh uza touched the ark
[12:27] but remember all the worship was right
[12:29] the only thing that was wrong was that
[12:30] the ark was in the wrong location
[12:33] he was trying to do got a good service
[12:34] and it turned out to be a good service
[12:36] but he just missed the will of God in
[12:38] this one detail of his life right he
[12:41] just missed it he didn't seek God about
[12:42] this aspect of it but still notice here
[12:45] look at verse five and David and all the
[12:47] house of Israel played before the Lord
[12:49] on all manner of instruments made of
[12:51] furwood even on harps on solitaries on
[12:54] Timbers on cornets and on symbols praise
[12:58] God
[12:59] Hallelujah
[13:01] and then of course later on we skipped
[13:03] down there verse 12 and it was told King
[13:05] David saying the Lord has blessed the
[13:07] house of Obed Edom and all that
[13:09] pertaineth unto him because of the Ark
[13:11] of God so David went and brought up the
[13:12] ark from the house of Obed Edom into the
[13:15] city of David with gladness
[13:18] so see David made a mistake but church
[13:20] is what I love he learned from his
[13:22] mistake
[13:23] he wasn't going to complain about it he
[13:25] wasn't going to uh suffer too long about
[13:28] it he's going to say what's wrong let me
[13:30] fix it and let me get glad again in the
[13:32] house of the Lord amen hallelujah I've
[13:35] lost my gladness you know a man died a
[13:37] man died but he was able to get his
[13:39] gladness back he fixed the problem he
[13:41] got right back in the word yes he got
[13:43] right back in the perfect one of God
[13:44] Amen
[13:46] and then he could bring it up with
[13:47] praise and dancing just like he did it
[13:49] the first time Hallelujah and that's
[13:51] what I want to just point out all the
[13:53] instruments so we got a tambourine here
[13:54] tonight we got a piano organ we got a
[13:56] guitar how do we got these 10 string
[13:58] instruments right here we got vocal
[14:00] cords we can praise God with Hallelujah
[14:02] we got feet we can praise God with holy
[14:04] God we've got hands we can command our
[14:06] hands to praise the Lord all these
[14:08] instruments God wants all instruments to
[14:10] glorify him praise God
[14:12] bring her he said bring up the Ark of
[14:15] God bring up the presence of God back to
[14:16] the house of God bring it up with praise
[14:18] bring it up with instruments bring it up
[14:20] with worship because God is worthy of it
[14:22] all Hallelujah
[14:23] he's worthy of it all praise God Look
[14:25] What the Lord Has Done Hallelujah
[14:28] thank you Jesus
[14:30] oh it's beautiful
[14:32] that was verse 12.
[14:35] now go down to verse 14. and David
[14:37] danced before the Lord with all of his
[14:39] might and David was girded with the
[14:41] Leonard ephod the priesthood praise God
[14:43] so David in all the house of Israel
[14:46] brought up the Ark of the Lord was
[14:47] shouting and with the sound of a trumpet
[14:50] and as the Ark of the Lord came to the
[14:52] city of David McCall Saul's daughter
[14:54] looked through a window and saw King
[14:57] David leaping and dancing before the
[14:59] Lord and she despised him in her heart
[15:02] that isn't that something Church she
[15:05] could be married to this man and she
[15:07] despised his worship
[15:10] and that's something you can be so close
[15:12] to people and despise them
[15:14] now what we need church is the love of
[15:16] Jesus Christ Hallelujah right that's
[15:19] what we need we need the love of Jesus
[15:21] Christ so we don't despise people that
[15:23] are worshiping we can we can get past
[15:25] our uh differences and Worship the Lord
[15:28] praise God and sing his praises and
[15:30] Shout his Praises Hallelujah get into
[15:32] the spirit of God but someone so close
[15:34] even as a married partner
[15:37] somehow could forget the love between
[15:39] them and somehow could get such a
[15:41] starchy attitude that they no longer can
[15:44] worship and they speak against a real
[15:46] worshiper and David said if you don't
[15:47] like that your criticism is not stopping
[15:50] me I'll do more praise God
[15:54] hallelujah praise God that's what he had
[15:56] to do he couldn't let that Antichrist
[15:59] Spirit cool off his worship he had to
[16:01] worship anyway praise God
[16:04] oh my God see Church you know we come to
[16:06] church maybe even tonight I don't really
[16:08] feel like praising the Lord but I know I
[16:09] want to give God a sacrifice of praise
[16:12] you may have had a hard day you may have
[16:14] had a hard week
[16:16] I mean most of us have right
[16:18] but it's it's always a good thing to get
[16:20] out of the Flesh and get into the spirit
[16:22] praise God
[16:23] because God inhabits the Praises of his
[16:27] people the holy spirit's anointing you
[16:28] when you're praising the Lord hallelujah
[16:31] oh thank God Amen
[16:35] church we don't want the despiser's
[16:37] heart
[16:39] that will kill a church so fast brother
[16:42] said it's like a cancer that will come
[16:44] into the church
[16:46] right you know just in fact one person
[16:48] to the other one person to the other
[16:51] McCall despised it and I preached us
[16:53] years ago
[16:54] but I was uh
[16:57] remembering how there was numerous
[16:59] people that criticized the worship of
[17:02] the Lord
[17:03] right like we saw with uh McCall
[17:06] and remember uh there's some more we
[17:08] want to read here by God's grace let's
[17:10] go to Matthew 21 14. let's go to Matthew
[17:12] 21 14.
[17:14] now I said that on last Wednesday it was
[17:17] such a statement I felt it was the Lord
[17:20] but God looked down he said that's a son
[17:22] after my own heart and then he said I've
[17:23] got to curse the other one
[17:27] look that woman had made such she made a
[17:29] final like almost like a final decision
[17:30] I'm not gonna support the worship of God
[17:34] I'm going to stay in my uh stiff starchy
[17:37] religious mode she she must have made
[17:40] that decision or else God would have had
[17:41] mercy on her
[17:42] see church we don't want to get to a
[17:44] spot where we we won't repent praise God
[17:45] we want to be in a spot where we can
[17:47] repent praise God oh God hallelujah
[17:49] thank God
[17:50] we always want to repent we don't want
[17:53] to be in a spot where we can't repent or
[17:55] don't feel repentance
[18:01] Matthew 21 14 sorry let's do 14 15 and
[18:04] 16.
[18:07] and the Blind and the lame came to him
[18:09] in the temple and he healed them
[18:11] hallelujah look at that healing in the
[18:12] Church of God hallelujah how many times
[18:14] has God healed in this house praise God
[18:16] he's the same yesterday today and
[18:18] forever
[18:19] and when the chief priests and Scribe
[18:21] saw the wonderful things that he did and
[18:22] the Children Cry now they saw me like
[18:24] weeping it means like shouting and
[18:26] praising the Lord
[18:28] and saying Hosanna let me save us to the
[18:30] Son of God save us they were so
[18:33] displeased so here again we see that
[18:34] Antichrist Spirit on the high priest now

[22:11] thank you Jesus
[22:14] so look Church there's that Antichrist
[22:17] Spirit there
[22:18] the same one that was there
[22:21] in McCall's day
[22:23] here it is but we also see the Holy
[22:25] Spirit the holy spirit says go on and
[22:27] praise the Lord
[22:28] just like in David's day go on and
[22:30] praise the Lord hallelujah don't stop
[22:32] praising the Lord keep praising God and
[22:34] here it is in Jesus day these Thousand
[22:36] Years Later the holy spirit said go
[22:38] ahead shout out the Praises go ahead and
[22:40] cry loud go ahead and worship Jesus
[22:42] don't stop him let Him worship praise
[22:44] God
[22:45] oh Hallelujah
[22:48] Luke 19 35.
[23:01] beautiful story here
[23:04] now here we see Jesus coming in on Palm
[23:07] Sunday by God's grace
[23:14] so the first passage children are crying
[23:16] out in the temple and Jesus says haven't
[23:19] you read the word of God this is how
[23:21] worship is supposed to be
[23:23] first you know what we we don't you know
[23:25] we can grow it we can grow in childlike
[23:27] faith
[23:28] right
[23:29] just if we just like a child you know
[23:31] like today we were at our house you know
[23:32] and
[23:33] and I think it was uh Zion and Genevieve
[23:36] just started saying let's I just had
[23:38] like I was playing some music from
[23:39] Christian music on my phone and we were
[23:41] just over there
[23:42] in our basement there and Genevieve is
[23:45] also like hey let's dance and Zion's
[23:46] like let's dance you know how you you
[23:48] know how he repeats everybody's phrases
[23:49] you know
[23:51] I thought look how easy it is for a
[23:53] child ah look how easy it is for a
[23:56] natural shot to enter into dancing what
[23:58] about a spiritual child amen
[24:00] to enter the Praises of God hallelujah
[24:04] I thought that would be
[24:06] look how simple look how childlike faith
[24:08] can just enter into the promises of God
[24:11] oh it's beautiful
[24:13] Luke 19 35 and they brought him to Jesus
[24:16] and they cast their garments upon the
[24:18] cult and they set Jesus thereon and as
[24:21] he went they spread their clothes in the
[24:23] way
[24:24] now let me stop there this is one of the
[24:26] verses I've used to say of the
[24:28] importance of praying before service
[24:30] you've got to lay the clothes before
[24:32] Jesus you got to make the way for Jesus
[24:34] to come in
[24:36] right you got to lay them there the
[24:38] other one was in uh I think it's Exodus
[24:40] or Deuteronomy the people had to bring
[24:42] the oil so the priest could minister
[24:45] Hallelujah and the third was Joshua the
[24:49] singers and some of the soldiers went
[24:51] before the ark the word of God
[24:53] and the armed one represent those who
[24:56] had the the full armor of God on praise
[24:58] God and the Bible says we got the full
[25:00] armor of God on the Bible says you're
[25:01] praying always with all prayer and
[25:03] supplication in the Holy Spirit
[25:05] that's right so there's three Witnesses
[25:08] church that we need to pray before
[25:10] service praise God and lay our requests
[25:12] before God lay our palms down before God
[25:15] hallelujah lay in his presence wait upon
[25:18] the Lord he'll renew your strength
[25:20] you'll rise up like the eagle if you
[25:22] wait upon the Lord Jesus Christ
[25:26] I didn't get to that one on Sunday
[25:27] morning brother Chris I wanted to get to
[25:29] that one I think
[25:33] I think that's a great teaching that
[25:34] scripture has meant so much to me those
[25:36] scriptures
[25:37] power of prayer before the word of God
[25:39] and then brother Adam said if a preacher
[25:41] walks into a congregation like that
[25:42] they're bound to hear from heaven
[25:45] that's that should be the desire of our
[25:46] hearts to hear from heaven
[25:48] Hallelujah Glory
[25:51] verse seven I'm sorry 37.
[25:54] and when he was come nigh even now at
[25:56] The Descent of the Mount of Olives the
[25:57] whole multitude of the disciples began
[25:59] to rejoice and praise God with a whisper
[26:03] huh where they Whispering when the Son
[26:05] of God was there no sir with a loud
[26:08] voice for all the mighty works that they
[26:10] had seen Hallelujah church we sing that
[26:12] song he's done so much for me I cannot
[26:15] tell it all
[26:16] Hallelujah so if we really believe that
[26:19] we should have plenty of praise for
[26:21] Jesus
[26:22] right
[26:23] the mighty Works you've seen now some
[26:25] seem more Mighty than others but the
[26:26] route of it is if we're saved we've seen
[26:28] Mighty Works in our lives
[26:30] we all got a reason to praise amen
[26:33] Glory
[26:36] verse 38 saying blessed be the king that
[26:39] cometh in the name of the Lord peace in
[26:42] heaven and glory in the highest and some
[26:44] of the Pharisees from among the Malton
[26:45] look at these guys said a master rebuke
[26:47] thy disciples
[26:49] saying Jesus you need to rebuke them
[26:51] look at Satan trying to get the Son of
[26:54] God to rebuke his own children
[26:57] right
[26:58] I wonder what Jesus would Jesus give
[27:00] into that peer pressure well you need to
[27:02] rebuke them they're too loud too much
[27:05] noise we should have some services like
[27:06] that where we're really loud amen
[27:09] we're really enjoying praising the Lord
[27:11] amen and thanking God for all that he's
[27:14] done hallelujah
[27:15] hallelujah thank God
[27:19] he said Master rebuked these people
[27:23] Jesus rebuked them because they're
[27:25] praising you
[27:27] a church if he's the same yesterday
[27:28] today forever what do you think is going
[27:30] to happen today praise God
[27:32] which spirit is going to try to cool you
[27:34] down and not give God all the praise
[27:36] there's only one spirit that does that
[27:38] praise God
[27:39] Hallelujah and the devil say rebuke them
[27:42] there's too much shout and there's too
[27:44] much praising too much of glorifying God
[27:46] and Jesus says right back in verse 40.
[27:49] can you put it up there verse 40.
[27:52] he says and he answers to them I tell
[27:54] you that if thee should hold their peace
[27:57] the stones would immediately cry out
[28:00] amen if these people don't praise God
[28:03] Something's Gonna praise God Amen this
[28:06] is scripture being fulfilled the church
[28:07] guys say like this our lives are
[28:09] fulfilling scripture praise God
[28:11] Hallelujah every day that we live we get
[28:14] closer to the Rapture I knew the Rapture
[28:16] is closer we're fulfilling scripture God
[28:17] help us to give him praise amen
[28:20] thank God Amen
[28:23] thank you Jesus
[28:25] oh it's beautiful
[28:27] so now we got two he says he says
[28:29] haven't you read in the scripture
[28:31] the the praise of children is perfected
[28:34] praise
[28:35] then he says if they will worship God he
[28:38] said the stones would immediately cry
[28:41] out
[28:42] like brother man preach that sermon what
[28:43] is the attraction on the mountain and
[28:45] that's this was a mountain right right
[28:47] here by the Mount of Olives he was
[28:48] coming right down in the city praise God
[28:50] what was the attraction scripture is
[28:52] being fulfilled the Messiah is coming oh
[28:54] Jesus is coming suddenly to his Temple
[28:57] and pretty soon Church Jesus coming to
[28:59] his broad amen
[29:01] well hopefully it's in our day if not
[29:02] praise God let's live like it is praise
[29:04] God every Christian should live like it
[29:06] is going to be in their day so they
[29:08] prepared they're not getting lacks on
[29:10] God they're not getting lazy they're not
[29:12] getting distracted they're focused on
[29:14] Jesus and they're living like he's
[29:15] coming praise God
[29:17] Hallelujah
[29:20] oh thank you Lord
[29:25] now as I was studying this I thought wow
[29:27] Jesus said in other words he said I'm
[29:29] not going to rebuke them
[29:32] I'm not going to rebuke real worshipers
[29:34] when people are excited about what Jesus
[29:36] doing I won't rebuke them
[29:39] you know why because the same
[29:41] uh the same voice
[29:44] here speaking through Jesus the Same the
[29:46] same Divine voice speaking through Jesus
[29:49] letting the praise go forth Jesus was
[29:52] not letting the Pharisees touch the
[29:53] worship
[29:55] he wasn't going to let the Pharisees
[29:57] hinder the worship of God
[29:59] so I love it the same voice that said I
[30:02] won't rebuke him
[30:03] they've got to praise God the same voice
[30:06] we find under the third seal
[30:08] when Satan is riding in the Dark Ages
[30:10] got bounces in his hand he's capturing
[30:12] the wealth of the world it's dark ages
[30:14] they don't have Bibles they don't have
[30:16] truth
[30:18] but what does the voice say in the midst
[30:19] of the darkest age brother said it was
[30:21] the darkest age
[30:23] in the midst of the darkest age they all
[30:25] of a sudden in the time where where the
[30:27] the black horse riders riding they hear
[30:29] a voice crowd and the voice says hurt
[30:31] not the wide and the oil praise God oh
[30:35] in other words Jesus is always
[30:37] protecting the stimulation of Revelation
[30:39] and the love the baptism of the Holy
[30:42] Ghost Jesus will always protect that
[30:44] he'll always let the people praise God
[30:46] he'll always give them Freedom he'll
[30:48] always let them rejoice in his presence
[30:49] praise God
[30:51] he won't rebuke us for praising the Lord
[30:55] thank you Jesus Hallelujah that really
[30:58] blessed me today praise God
[31:00] Jesus is always protecting the Holy
[31:02] Ghost worshipers
[31:04] Hallelujah
[31:07] he says touch not my oil and my wine in
[31:10] other words I'm not going to rebuke them
[31:12] for praising me
[31:13] I'm not going to rebuke these children
[31:15] for crying out I'm not going to rebuke
[31:17] David for dancing with all of his might
[31:19] at the happiness of seeing the word
[31:21] returned
[31:22] oh oh my thank the Lord praise God
[31:27] I love you Jesus thank you Lord God
[31:29] hallelujah beautiful story
[31:31] Mark 14 verse 3 let's go there mark 14
[31:33] verse 3. thank you Jesus
[31:56] so again we see here Jesus protecting
[31:58] the oil and the wine
[32:01] verse 3 and being in Bethany in the
[32:03] house of Simon the leper as he said at
[32:04] me there came a woman having an
[32:06] alabaster box of ointment of spitener
[32:08] very precious and she break the box and
[32:10] poured it on his head and there were
[32:12] some that had indignation within
[32:13] themselves see they're people just mad
[32:15] they're just mad
[32:17] right
[32:18] McCall was mad
[32:21] they're mad at the worship their sore
[32:23] displeased in Matthew 21.
[32:26] what was the other one uh they they
[32:28] thought these people need to rebuke for
[32:30] their worship
[32:31] oh my
[32:35] and they had Indonesian and said why was
[32:38] this waste of the ointment made for it
[32:41] might have been sold for more than 300
[32:43] Pence and have been given to the poor
[32:45] now that Satan lying right through
[32:47] judas's lips
[32:49] he wasn't even filled yet with Satan yet
[32:51] he's already letting Satan lie through
[32:52] his lips
[32:54] a fake compassion for the poor
[32:57] all in attempt to stop this woman from
[32:59] worshiping the Lord oh my God can you
[33:02] believe this is oh unbelievable It Was
[33:05] the Same Spirit now look oh it got more
[33:06] deceptive well the parents of the
[33:08] Antichrist Spirit gets more deceptive
[33:10] well now I see now it's just not oh tell
[33:12] them to shut that shut up tell them to
[33:14] stop this well now it's oh no we should
[33:16] have gave this money to the poor let's
[33:17] stop this worship and we should take
[33:19] this money to the poor and Jesus said
[33:21] you don't care nothing about the poor
[33:24] you don't care all you want to do is
[33:25] stop this worship
[33:27] why because worship empowers the person
[33:29] how they do worship brings you into the
[33:31] presence of Christ the King amen how do
[33:34] we just read that scripture he inhabits
[33:36] the Praises of his people God is right
[33:39] there God wants you to stay in that
[33:40] channel worship God doesn't want you to
[33:42] leave that channel he wants you to stay
[33:44] in the channel worship he doesn't want
[33:45] you to leave it and so Jesus will always
[33:47] protect that opportunity Jesus wants you
[33:50] to enjoy his presence he wants you to
[33:51] enjoy coming to church singing praises
[33:53] dancing shouting crying Hallelujah Jesus
[33:57] want you to enjoy that because you're
[33:58] living in his presence Hallelujah
[34:04] beautiful
[34:08] and they murmured against her imagine
[34:10] she's pouring out all this Praises on
[34:11] Christ
[34:18] they don't eat that should give us to
[34:20] the poor what a waste what a
[34:22] you know what an awful thing what an
[34:24] embarrassment this is to the master and
[34:26] the whole time Jesus is loving it
[34:28] Hallelujah because God Delights in the
[34:30] worship of his people praise God
[34:32] that's exactly right
[34:38] I love what Jesus and Jesus said in
[34:40] verse 6 let her alone
[34:43] see he says oh he always says touch not
[34:46] the oil and the wine
[34:48] you can't touch that
[34:50] stop criticizing her for worshiping
[34:53] because I'm only here for a little bit
[34:57] Lord this church we have a short window
[34:59] of our lifetime to worship

[35:07] in a just a general probability right

[35:13] probability it's not an exact number
[35:16] but see we're promised that we have a
[35:19] short window we don't know when it's our

[36:22] devils series of second Corinthians the
[36:24] Bible said uh these evil preachers would
[36:26] put the people in bondage
[36:28] right

[36:31] churches that fall away or
[36:33] denominational people they put the
[36:35] people in bondage and they don't allow
[36:38] them to be free in the Holy Spirit
[36:41] hallelujah it's my desire that every
[36:43] person here is Free by the grace of God
[36:46] that's my desire I'm going to be free
[36:48] today God sees your hands praise God God
[36:50] sees your hearts
[36:53] what a beautiful story
[36:55] Hallelujah should have been given to the
[36:57] poor but they murmured verse six and
[36:59] Jesus said let her alone
[37:02] don't trouble her I love that that see
[37:04] when you're worshiping God Jesus looks
[37:06] over at Satan said don't trouble this

[37:27] that stimulation by Revelation you can't
[37:30] touch that so t-shirts he church we just
[37:31] got to yield to it and let God flow
[37:33] through us because Jesus will protect us
[37:35] amen
[37:36] oh yes that's exactly right the Bible
[37:39] says he has to praise God
[37:41] he will not let it be hurt
[37:44] he will not let the oil and wine be
[37:46] destroyed
[37:48] it's not what the Bible says it's coming
[37:49] to me now the Bible says God will not
[37:51] leave himself without a witness
[37:53] oh thank you God there's always going to
[37:56] be somebody's got a witness of the oil
[37:58] and wine because Satan cannot stop it
[38:00] Jesus promised to protect it Hallelujah
[38:02] Jesus will not rebuke you for worship
[38:04] Jesus will encourage you to keep going
[38:06] praise God
[38:07] oh
[38:09] thank God Amen praise God hallelujah
[38:13] oh Hallelujah
[38:15] I'm glad I could be a fanatic for Jesus
[38:16] praise God
[38:19] Hallelujah aren't we all glad praise God
[38:22] glory
[38:25] I love this this is so beautiful
[38:29] he said let her alone why trouble ye her
[38:32] in other words Satan don't trouble them
[38:35] Jesus is going to make sure the troubles
[38:37] are lessened when you're when you're
[38:38] real worshiper
[38:40] the troubles won't last as long they
[38:42] won't be as hard because Jesus is going
[38:43] to protect you
[38:45] like that song says troubles don't last
[38:47] always
[38:48] right troubles don't last they must have
[38:51] been years since we say never troubles
[38:53] don't last always they don't last always
[38:55] right troubles pass
[38:58] right victories come because Jesus is
[39:00] protecting the oil and the wine
[39:03] he's protecting your soul that's what
[39:05] I'm saying amen thank God thank you Lord
[39:08] that's exactly right
[39:11] don't trouble her for sheath wrought a
[39:13] good work on me I love this for ye have
[39:15] the poor with you always in other words
[39:17] Judas you've had these poor people here
[39:19] all the time why aren't you ministers
[39:20] well why haven't you been ministering to
[39:21] them why are you complaining now
[39:27] see how the devil likes to do that
[39:29] so try to solve the problem but the
[39:31] whole time before he was ignoring the
[39:32] problem
[39:33] that's why we got to give all of us
[39:35] praise God that's why I got to fast and
[39:36] pray Hallelujah fast and pray and give
[39:39] alms always the Bible says pray without
[39:40] Cece
[39:43] see he brings us up he brings the poor
[39:44] people up but the whole time he's been
[39:45] neglecting them
[39:47] you don't really want to help the poor
[39:51] I'll say like this church we need a
[39:52] Cornelius attitude praise God
[39:54] cornillo says prayers were caught up in
[39:57] heaven can you imagine that brother the
[39:58] Angels had caught
[40:01] the prayers of Cornelius in a bowl
[40:04] as a memorial the Angels remembered his
[40:07] prayers his fasting his arms Church all
[40:09] Heaven is recording your love for Jesus
[40:12] praise God Amen amen heaven's got a
[40:14] record of it praise God and the devil
[40:16] can't get into God's computer system
[40:18] praise God the devil can't hack Heaven
[40:20] Hallelujah he's kicked out praise God
[40:22] Amen he's not going to hack that
[40:24] Hallelujah
[40:28] because I thus he don't have the keys to
[40:30] the kingdom
[40:32] hallelujah thank God Amen we've got the
[40:35] keys to the kingdom it's the name of
[40:37] Jesus Christ praise God
[40:39] ooh hallelujah thank God
[40:42] thank you Jesus
[40:44] she has a lot of good work on me for you
[40:46] have the poor verse 7 with you always
[40:47] and whensoever ye will you may do them
[40:50] good but me have not always now I love
[40:54] this she hath done what she could
[40:59] and remember verse 9 he said truly I
[41:01] send you wheresoever this gospel shall
[41:03] be preached throughout the whole world
[41:04] this also that she had done shall be
[41:07] spoken of of a memorial of her
[41:10] and Judas one of the 12 went under the
[41:13] chief priest to betray him then
[41:15] look at this Jesus picks up this one
[41:16] woman's worship this was such an
[41:18] intimate worship this was such a
[41:20] wonderful expression of Love Upon Jesus
[41:22] that Jesus picks us up and said I'm
[41:24] going to inspire oh he said I'm going to
[41:26] protect the oil I'm going to protect
[41:28] this so much I'm going to have preachers
[41:29] always preach this for 2 000 years ah
[41:33] this act of love praise God and here's
[41:35] what it is church she just did what she
[41:37] could
[41:37] God's not asking you do things you can't
[41:39] do God just wants you do things that you
[41:41] can do amen
[41:43] hallelujah I feel like you're punching
[41:45] the wall like brother Diggs here I don't
[41:47] want that thing to fall off the wall but
[41:48] last time he punched it something fell
[41:49] off the wall in there but hallelujah
[41:51] praise God he's not asking you
[41:53] everything he just wants you to do what
[41:55] you can do God I can come to church I
[41:58] can sing praises I can preach the word I
[42:01] can glorify God I can pray for the sick
[42:03] Church let's do what we can do because
[42:04] God is glorified in that
[42:07] just do what you can do amen
[42:10] Hallelujah just don't sell the Lord out
[42:12] and do less let's do all we can do
[42:17] oh Hallelujah
[42:19] Jesus told Satan there and Judas leave
[42:21] her alone he's protecting the oil and
[42:24] the wine do whatever you can to Worship
[42:27] the Lord
[42:32] then see Church there's going to be
[42:33] memorials right
[42:35] all your all your acts for Jesus and
[42:37] worship are memorials
[42:40] can we think of another one what about
[42:41] the queen of the South wasn't that a
[42:42] memorial
[42:44] it's gonna be such a memorial God's
[42:45] going to use it on the day of judgment
[42:47] she crossed the whole desert she put
[42:50] herself in danger of being robbed she
[42:52] put herself in danger of being abducted
[42:55] oh brother Adam says on tape a woman a
[42:58] woman
[42:59] not a man who could at least maybe fight
[43:01] for himself and maybe be equally as
[43:03] strong as another man a woman who
[43:05] couldn't even really defend herself she
[43:08] put everything on the line to support
[43:10] God's gifts amen ah and brother I said
[43:12] if we do that today if we support God's
[43:14] gifts we'll have another Millennium
[43:16] praise God Hallelujah in other words God
[43:18] will anoint the fifo ministry he'll
[43:20] Rapture his bride and we'll go into the
[43:22] Millennium praise God
[43:24] oh it's beautiful
[43:28] Hallelujah
[43:29] what a promise Church Satan can't stop
[43:32] the oil line tonight
[43:34] he can't stop it because Jesus Promised
[43:37] nobody can touch it
[43:39] nobody can touch it it's mine
[43:43] in church it's a memorial unto the Lord
[43:46] praise God
[43:47] what a blessing
[43:51] so there now we see there's four
[43:53] examples like McCall McCall's one of the
[43:55] four there's four examples of worship
[43:57] going forth and and Satan try to stop it
[44:00] right there but then Jesus steps in and
[44:02] said no this is right I'm not going to
[44:04] rebuke them they got to cry out I'm
[44:06] going to let them praise the Lord they
[44:08] Satan cannot touch the oil line
[44:11] now before I preach that list with
[44:13] spontaneous Praise Jesus loves
[44:15] spontaneous praise
[44:17] he likes somebody every now and then
[44:18] just to give a shout or a scream or a
[44:20] hallelujah or a weep or or a hand waved
[44:23] or or just a hallelujah or something he
[44:25] loves spontaneous worship he loves when
[44:27] his children respond to the word of God
[44:29] Amen hallelujah amen
[44:34] oh he loves the church he Delights in
[44:37] the worship Hallelujah he Delights in
[44:39] the praise of his people
[44:41] oh it's so beautiful
[44:44] what a beautiful portion of scripture
[44:49] so we see David now going back to David
[44:51] he danced before the Lord with all the
[44:53] instruments
[44:56] and the Antichrist Spirit hated that
[44:59] it hated everybody getting an instrument
[45:01] it hated everybody
[45:03] like our church is so small if everybody
[45:05] got an instrument I mean if a couple
[45:07] more of us get a few instruments we'll
[45:08] have a whole church band like everybody
[45:09] in the church will have an instrument
[45:11] right
[45:13] I used to play the Tamarin years ago and
[45:15] I stopped doing it because I didn't feel
[45:16] like I was very successful at it I still
[45:18] have a hard time with beat by the way
[45:20] but I just want you to see this God
[45:23] loves when everybody's involved and
[45:25] everybody's giving Glory everybody's
[45:27] making a sacrifice of praise Hallelujah
[45:29] God loves that and God looks down from
[45:31] heaven say that's a church after my own
[45:33] heart that's a church that wants to go
[45:34] in the Rapture praise God Amen that's a
[45:37] church who doesn't just talk about being
[45:38] the bride of Christ they are the bride
[45:40] of Christ amen
[45:42] Hallelujah I said church that's not not
[45:43] just we're just called The Bride of
[45:45] Jesus the bride of Christ Fellowship but
[45:47] we actually are the bride of Christ
[45:50] Hallelujah
[45:52] church I don't want to talk about it I
[45:54] don't want to have a name I live but I'm
[45:56] dead
[45:57] that was the starter's Church age where
[45:59] Lutheran and 90 of them Luther said fell
[46:01] away
[46:02] I don't want to fall away I want to keep
[46:03] pressing on I want Jesus to protect my
[46:06] wine and oil amen I want him to let me
[46:09] praise let me be a free man let me be to
[46:11] worshiper let me be a true Son of God
[46:14] who cries out and worships the Lord amen
[46:17] hallelujah I kind of like having a
[46:18] little more room up here to preach about
[46:19] God's grace
[46:21] now I got a little bit of room to
[46:22] there's enough room for me to preach in
[46:24] here now you know like like that old
[46:25] Mishawaka preacher said

[46:30] see if I can bring this down here

[46:39] go to uh Jeremiah 31 here Jeremiah 31.

[56:27] praise God thank you for your love Dear
[56:28] God
[56:30] Hallelujah
[56:33] well now I'm feeling good Hallelujah
[56:35] took a little while I'm feeling good now
[56:37] very good it takes about an hour to feel
[56:39] good preaching but man said it takes me
[56:41] an hour to warm up in an hour to slow
[56:43] down or an hour to shut down
[56:45] I can relate to that sometimes
[56:48] Hallelujah beautiful
[56:52] God would we rebuild Israel and then she
[56:55] would dance
[56:58] is that what the word of God says
[57:02] now Church what does build again mean
[57:04] build again means edify
[57:08] edify means to make strong and complete
[57:12] so see how your joy of the Lord is your
[57:15] strength see how your strength is
[57:17] connected to your praise
[57:20] right
[57:21] you can't have praise you can't have a
[57:23] dance put that back together would you
[57:24] honey uh Jeremiah 31 was it for
[57:29] see when you're built you're strong
[57:30] because that's edification edification
[57:32] is building up you come to church you
[57:33] get stronger you hear the word of God
[57:34] stronger you feed on God's word stronger
[57:36] stronger stronger and then comes the
[57:38] dance
[57:39] so see how it's so important the joy of
[57:42] the Lord is your strength Hallelujah if
[57:46] we want to be strong we've got to let
[57:47] God build up our lives God's not trying
[57:49] to tear us down it's Satan that's trying
[57:51] to tear us down but God is trying to
[57:53] build us up and then when God builds us
[57:54] up we should be glad about it and say
[57:56] thank God I'm strong again now I'm going
[57:58] to give God praise amen because he
[58:00] didn't give up on me Hallelujah
[58:03] praise God he could have given up on me
[58:05] and my shamos and my my destruction and
[58:07] my sins he could have gave up on me and
[58:09] my iniquity my transgressions but he did
[58:12] it because his love is unfailing praise
[58:14] God it's everlasting love it's love that
[58:17] cannot fail praise God it's love that is
[58:19] faithful Hallelujah
[58:22] I didn't know y'all
[58:24] in other words I won't let you fall
[58:28] I won't let you be demolished
[58:30] I'm backing up with myself Hallelujah
[58:33] [Music]
[58:34] Hallelujah with my everlasting love
[58:37] praise God
[58:39] I'm backing you up myself Hallelujah
[58:43] thank you Jesus
[58:46] the Lord is the strength of my life I
[58:48] remember that from the book of Psalms
[58:50] the Lord is the light of my salvation
[58:51] the Lord is the strength of my life
[58:54] Church you and I can only be strong if
[58:57] God's anointing us
[58:58] and God anoints us when we praise him
[59:01] when we obey the word of God
[59:03] that's when God anoints us amen when we
[59:06] obey trust and obey
[59:10] and then God anoints us to praise His
[59:12] name
[59:13] to worship His holy name
[59:15] oh it's so beautiful
[59:17] remember the steps Joshua gave us in
[59:19] Joshua chapter one we're not going to
[59:20] turn there
[59:21] but he said be strong be only thou
[59:24] strong and very courageous to keep all
[59:27] the word of the Lord that you don't
[59:28] stray from the right to the left
[59:31] then he says let the word of God always
[59:34] be in your mouth
[59:35] what's the third one and then he said
[59:37] meditate it on it all day and night
[59:41] three steps keep the word of God don't
[59:43] go astray speak it and meditate on it
[59:48] obey it speak it think on it praise God
[59:51] let's say it together let's say obey it
[59:53] speak it
[59:54] stink it
[59:56] Hallelujah it's not just press play
[1:00:01] it's just obey speak and meditate amen
[1:00:04] that's what it is praise God anybody can
[1:00:07] press play and live like a devil and
[1:00:09] inject false doctors in there but those
[1:00:11] who do those three steps praise God
[1:00:13] those that obey and don't turn to left
[1:00:15] or right they don't take a permissive
[1:00:17] will of God those that stay on the
[1:00:18] narrow road and speak the word of God
[1:00:20] and meditative on it Hallelujah they're
[1:00:22] the strong ones they're the ones that
[1:00:24] are giving God praise Hallelujah
[1:00:26] it's kind of nice you're standing there
[1:00:28] because I can kind of point right here
[1:00:28] and you know
[1:00:31] gives me a little bit of a room to
[1:00:32] stretch out there
[1:00:34] Hallelujah
[1:00:36] there's not enough room for me to preach
[1:00:37] in here I'm just joking
[1:00:41] Hallelujah
[1:00:43] see Church what is it when we're strong
[1:00:45] what do we got we got the full armor of
[1:00:46] God on
[1:00:48] now I want to review this briefly for
[1:00:50] brother Chris so let's go to Ephesians
[1:00:51] chapter six brother brother you want to
[1:00:52] be strong and Lord we talked we did the
[1:00:54] Bible say this week on the phone right
[1:00:55] we talked about the basics right well
[1:00:57] here's what you do when you do that when
[1:00:58] you're studying in the morning you're
[1:01:00] seeking the kingdom of God first
[1:01:01] Ephesians chapter 6.
[1:01:06] just briefly
[1:01:08] then I got
[1:01:09] there's two more verses after that
[1:01:13] thank you Lord
[1:01:15] Ephesians 6. now Church it kind of came
[1:01:17] to me that
[1:01:19] if I'm not mistaken all these six
[1:01:21] attributes of the armor are in the human
[1:01:23] Spirit or mind
[1:01:26] all right so like like we say it just
[1:01:28] you know simply we got to get our minds
[1:01:30] right
[1:01:31] if we're going to be Warriors for Christ
[1:01:33] we got to get our minds right
[1:01:35] first thing we got to do every day get
[1:01:37] your mind right
[1:01:38] church I wake up I'm surprised how many
[1:01:40] times I wake up in a bad attitude
[1:01:42] I'm like I was dancing at church the
[1:01:43] other day like how can I be
[1:01:46] screaming and crying and praising the
[1:01:48] Lord I was shaking hands I was weeping
[1:01:49] on somebody's shoulder what happened to
[1:01:52] me right I got well just got in the
[1:01:54] flesh
[1:01:55] right got tired got in the flesh like
[1:01:58] everybody else praise God
[1:01:59] right I was just sleeping
[1:02:02] so we got to get our minds right right
[1:02:04] away
[1:02:05] now brother Chris here it is
[1:02:07] verse 11 brother actually let's read 10.
[1:02:10] finally my brother be strong in the Lord
[1:02:11] in the power of His might so it's not
[1:02:13] our might it's the Lord's might
[1:02:15] verse 11 put on the whole armor of God
[1:02:18] that you may be able to stand though
[1:02:19] Against The Wiles of the devil really
[1:02:21] church that's all we're battling is
[1:02:22] Satan's got traps for us
[1:02:24] Satan just set up things in our lives
[1:02:26] trying to distract us trying to get us
[1:02:27] to lay down our armor but we've got to
[1:02:29] keep the armor on
[1:02:31] in every area of Life he's trying to get
[1:02:33] us to lay down the sword or lay down the
[1:02:35] helmet of salvation are you really saved
[1:02:36] you really think you're sick you think
[1:02:38] you're good enough to be saved of course
[1:02:39] I'm not good enough that's why Jesus
[1:02:41] died for me praise God
[1:02:43] Hallelujah
[1:02:45] I can't get to heaven there'll be no
[1:02:46] Bragging in heaven why did all these
[1:02:48] Miracles or I did all these sermons
[1:02:50] there's not one brag in heaven all the
[1:02:52] bragging all the versions is on Christ
[1:02:54] Jesus Hallelujah
[1:02:56] amen there's no man that'll boasts in
[1:02:58] the presence of Jesus Christ praise God
[1:03:01] we're just tools that God may have
[1:03:02] picked up for a little while a couple
[1:03:03] years for six months God picked up John
[1:03:06] the Baptist and used him drank out of
[1:03:09] him use his ministry set him down and
[1:03:10] let him be beheaded
[1:03:12] sometimes God will train you for 30
[1:03:14] years
[1:03:15] for six months of ministry
[1:03:18] I know shine you before the whole world
[1:03:20] and then set you down and put you off on
[1:03:21] the side
[1:03:23] now how many of us want to wait 30 years
[1:03:25] to be used by God
[1:03:27] I would raise my hand for that I'm glad
[1:03:29] nobody raised our hand
[1:03:30] I was thinking today about all the
[1:03:31] financial blessings we've got in the
[1:03:33] last few years but I thought you know
[1:03:34] what all those came after
[1:03:37] 15 years of pastoring
[1:03:40] real small churches
[1:03:44] in other words I wasn't living the rich
[1:03:46] life I wasn't living the High Life
[1:03:48] sometimes preaching just one person one
[1:03:50] time I preached to just a phone
[1:03:53] everybody's sick on a Wednesday night I
[1:03:54] think somebody took Lydia out to use the
[1:03:56] restroom and I was just preaching on it
[1:03:57] to a phone
[1:03:59] that's the way of humility Church
[1:04:01] that's a way of Fame and Fortune that's
[1:04:04] the way of humanity God's humbled me
[1:04:05] through years and years of testing and
[1:04:08] trials
[1:04:09] he's humbled me over and over and over
[1:04:11] again and at church that's because I
[1:04:12] constantly need it
[1:04:13] Satan's constantly trying to break down
[1:04:15] my walls but God's always building me
[1:04:17] back up again
[1:04:18] hallelujah praise God these last few
[1:04:21] years I've never seen such Financial
[1:04:22] blessings bra but look at all the years
[1:04:24] of sacrifice it took
[1:04:27] it did not come easy
[1:04:29] and I did not expect any of that
[1:04:33] I was thinking about like John the
[1:04:34] Baptist 30 years in the wilderness 30
[1:04:37] years
[1:04:38] I'm going to use you for six months
[1:04:43] was it hard to understand yes but was it
[1:04:45] God's will yes
[1:04:47] it was God's everlasting love to John
[1:04:49] the Baptist
[1:04:53] verse 12 brother Chris we don't wrestle
[1:04:56] against flesh and blood
[1:04:58] our enemies are not other people
[1:05:01] but against principalities against
[1:05:03] Powers against rulers of Darkness of
[1:05:05] this world against spiritual wickedness
[1:05:07] in high places
[1:05:09] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[1:05:11] of God that you may be able to withstand
[1:05:13] in that evil day and to having done all
[1:05:16] stand you have to withstand his attacks
[1:05:19] in other words you know you're going to
[1:05:20] get dark shot at you but you've got to
[1:05:23] withstand them we'll never get to a spot
[1:05:25] Church where we can just hide away and
[1:05:27] say oh no more battles
[1:05:29] Satan can't get me no
[1:05:31] no
[1:05:32] that's not how it's going to be we have
[1:05:35] to withstand them we have to see the
[1:05:36] dark coming
[1:05:38] and just pick up the shield and say by
[1:05:41] faith I'll overcome praise God
[1:05:43] hallelujah praise God we got to stand
[1:05:46] and look the fiery darts in the face and
[1:05:49] say I've got weapons I've got a defense
[1:05:51] I've got Christ in me so I'm more than a
[1:05:54] conqueror amen
[1:05:55] we gotta look the enemy right in the
[1:05:57] face and say not today Satan amen get
[1:06:00] thee behind me in the name of Jesus
[1:06:02] Christ I take Faith and defeat you
[1:06:04] praise God
[1:06:06] you're not hitting my heart
[1:06:08] you're not going to hurt me
[1:06:10] because I've got faith Hallelujah is
[1:06:13] that right

[1:06:16] burning attacks I'm not going to let
[1:06:17] those burning thoughts get in me I've
[1:06:19] got faith

[1:06:39] I'm sorry sword today I'm going to pick
[1:06:41] up the shield

[1:06:48] warnings on Sunday morning remember that
[1:06:50] I was saying they're going to try to

[1:06:54] if you've got a real Revelation the
[1:06:55] Gates of Hell will never Prevail against
[1:06:57] you
[1:06:58] because your weapons are mightier than

[1:09:05] already believe that
[1:09:06] I believe with all my heart
[1:09:08] with all my heart because Jesus Promised
[1:09:10] it
[1:09:12] because we don't look at the natural
[1:09:13] things we look at the Unseen things
[1:09:16] we look at things that are Eternal not
[1:09:18] things that are temporary
[1:09:20] we're looking at spiritual principles
[1:09:22] being fulfilled in our lives
[1:09:26] I didn't know I was going to preach this
[1:09:27] law help me Lord Jesus

[1:10:41] father and right there in all day I said
[1:10:42] thank God for sending the son Jesus

[1:11:18] heart heart is your emotions
[1:11:20] your heart is protected by Jesus
[1:11:22] righteousness

[1:11:26] because Jesus is protecting that
[1:11:28] there it is can't touch the oil in the
[1:11:30] wine
[1:11:31] Hallelujah
[1:11:32] see you got to have your heart protected
[1:11:34] by the righteousness of Christ I'm not
[1:11:36] saved because of my righteousness I'm
[1:11:38] saved because of his righteousness and
[1:11:40] let me tell you this I'm daily seeking
[1:11:41] his righteousness
[1:11:43] I don't have enough of his righteousness
[1:11:45] that's why I got to seek it first every
[1:11:47] single day praise God
[1:11:49] righteousness is integrity
[1:11:52] purity of heart and life doing the
[1:11:54] Commandments keeping the word of God
[1:11:57] yes
[1:11:58] beautiful verse 15 having your feet shot
[1:12:01] with the preparation of the gospel of
[1:12:03] peace Brother Adam said that's being
[1:12:05] able to go Anytime Anyplace
[1:12:08] so this is now getting into Europe be
[1:12:10] able to witness or do the will of God or
