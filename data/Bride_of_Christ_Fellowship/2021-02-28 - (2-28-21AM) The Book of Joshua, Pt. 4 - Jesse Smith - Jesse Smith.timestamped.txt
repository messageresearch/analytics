[34:48] us here father in thy divine presence
[34:50] and father we'll be grateful when we
[34:51] leave this house we'll be happy and
[34:53] joyful
[34:54] leaving this house in jesus christ's
[34:55] name and this ain't said
[34:57] amen god bless you as you're being
[34:58] seated praise god
[35:02] i do want to ask real quick i think i
[35:04] forgot to
[35:05] ask and you can switch over i got some
[35:07] quotes here
[35:08] um does anybody need to take communion
[35:11] after the first service
[35:12] because you can't make the second is
[35:14] there anybody that would like to take
[35:15] communion
[35:16] with jose yes sir so we can take it so
[35:18] at the end of the service i'll just
[35:20] you know we'll sing i'll say you're
[35:21] dismissed and i'll ask everybody to
[35:22] leave
[35:23] or just you know leave out quietly and
[35:25] then we'll give communion to our brother
[35:27] by the grace of the lord always want to
[35:28] do that always want to give them a
[35:29] chance
[35:30] whoever can take communion to do it
[35:34] as we look at tonight shoe bread means
[35:37] the bread of his face
[35:39] that's what it means the bread of his
[35:41] face
[35:43] so that scripturally you're looking at
[35:45] the picture of the holy place
[35:46] they were eating bread right before his
[35:49] face because his his presence was in the
[35:50] holiest
[35:53] nobody else they all had bread out there
[35:55] right manna israel had men out they had
[35:57] their own bread
[35:58] but there was special holy bread the
[36:00] bible said it was
[36:01] fresh bread there was special bread
[36:05] that was shoe bread and that's in the
[36:07] presence of god so i'm kind of preaching
[36:08] my message for tonight
[36:11] i think you understand my god's grace so
[36:13] let's uh look to the lord here um
[36:16] make sure i got everything here i want
[36:17] to uh i think i'm able to i want to show
[36:20] a few things eventually let me see
[36:21] if i can switch over can you see this
[36:26] okay that'll be okay i just want to show
[36:28] a few things here
[36:31] no that wasn't it actually i want to
[36:32] show this one
[36:34] not that one i want to show that one and
[36:36] that one in a little bit okay
[36:38] just as the lord leads all right
[36:41] praise god let's look at joshua again
[36:43] this morning and i was
[36:45] uh you know praying and waiting for
[36:46] leadership on what to preach on and i'll
[36:48] set a timer let me just preach an hour
[36:49] here
[36:50] uh so tonight we won't do the kids bible
[36:52] study i just want to preach a regular
[36:54] message okay
[36:55] just so i can be as sincere as possible
[36:58] um
[37:00] uh it's such an important thing brother
[37:02] said if we don't take communion the
[37:03] right way we're cursed
[37:04] right with a temporary curse not a not a
[37:06] permanent
[37:07] but it's a temporary chastisement the
[37:09] bible calls it
[37:10] and so we always want to take the lord's
[37:12] supper uh as sincerely and reverently as
[37:15] possible
[37:17] um so now we i just want to look at this
[37:19] thought of be strong and very courageous
[37:21] out of joshua chapter one
[37:24] i just want to linger on this for a
[37:25] little bit longer
[37:29] why was it there was a reason i went
[37:31] back and listened to last sunday's
[37:32] message and i just
[37:33] felt the real good anointing at the end
[37:35] of the sermon and
[37:36] just saw people worshiping and praising
[37:38] god
[37:40] thanking god for his strength are you
[37:41] thankful for god's strength today
[37:43] amen praise god we're so blessed to be
[37:45] able to have god's strength
[37:47] so we ended last week i kind of ended
[37:49] with this thought
[37:50] in deuteronomy god uh moses is telling
[37:52] joshua the prophet
[37:53] saying be strong be strong and then in
[37:56] joshua 1
[37:57] god's telling him be strong be strong
[37:59] and then finally
[38:01] the officers are telling joshua just be
[38:03] strong and very courageous
[38:05] so in other words everybody is around
[38:07] him telling him to be strong
[38:08] and so no doubt that means he would have
[38:10] had battles to be strong
[38:13] he would have been tempted to become
[38:14] weak right because now
[38:16] i've got a i got to fill the shoes of
[38:18] moses ah
[38:20] he's a great man of god and no doubt
[38:22] there was no man like moses
[38:24] but you know brother man makes an
[38:25] interesting point i don't know if you
[38:26] listen to
[38:27] as i was with moses this week brother
[38:29] branham made a point
[38:30] and he said uh joshua actually had a
[38:33] greater work to do than that of moses
[38:36] now that's quite a statement uh and i'm
[38:39] just taking brother brandon about his
[38:40] word for i don't have a scripture for
[38:41] that but i know he said that
[38:43] what a statement that is how many think
[38:46] it'd be
[38:46] difficult to move uh two million people
[38:49] i moved when i had five kids out to
[38:51] doyle's town that was quite a move with
[38:52] five kids
[38:55] imagine two million kids quite a move
[38:59] moses did that by the rod of god amen
[39:02] he did it by the miracles by the plagues
[39:04] and by the power of god
[39:06] and then he brought them you know out
[39:07] there and he came he brought him all the
[39:09] way up to kadesh but they turned it down
[39:10] so he had to take him in a
[39:11] in a circle a proverbial circle well
[39:14] maybe a literal circle in the desert all
[39:15] those years
[39:16] and take him from place to place and
[39:18] then he finally come back to that
[39:19] mountain praise god
[39:21] uh where they were close ready to take
[39:23] the promised land right
[39:25] uh what what uh what a work that he did
[39:28] but brother adam said joshua had a
[39:30] bigger job to do
[39:32] and if and i guess one the one way i see
[39:34] it brother jose is because he had more
[39:36] kings to defeat
[39:38] moses defeated pharaoh thank god the
[39:41] mightiest army
[39:42] uh the amalekites remember we looked at
[39:44] that a few weeks ago joshua that was
[39:46] joshua's first battle praise god
[39:48] the amalekites moses said get your army
[39:51] ready you're going to fight tomorrow
[39:53] we have no record of him being a soldier
[39:54] or general until that time
[39:56] he said get ready tomorrow you're going
[39:58] to fight and you're going to lead the
[39:59] people tomorrow
[40:00] but it didn't matter because god was
[40:02] with him amen
[40:03] in church i'll say like this we need to
[40:04] be instant and in season
[40:06] why because god is with us amen
[40:09] hallelujah
[40:11] if uh you know there's been a couple of
[40:12] times i didn't know i was going to
[40:13] preach i was at special meetings by
[40:14] shane
[40:15] i didn't know i was going to preach in
[40:16] the book said you're going to preach in
[40:17] a few minutes i said
[40:18] amen the last time it happened was at
[40:20] new york i thought brother brooks was
[40:22] going to preach
[40:22] and the preacher said no you're going to
[40:24] preach and it was just in a few moments
[40:26] and i said good i've been fasting all
[40:28] day amen
[40:30] and it was just the lord you know i i
[40:32] wasn't
[40:33] preaching but the lord said we just got
[40:35] to be instant
[40:36] in season out of season we got to be
[40:38] ready no matter what the lord allows to
[40:40] happen or
[40:40] whatever the lord allows the devil to
[40:42] bring about us we know we're more than
[40:44] conquerors
[40:45] we know that the greater is he that's in
[40:47] us than he that's in the world
[40:49] amen that's why jesus sent the holy
[40:51] ghost he said i'm going to give you
[40:53] power when you receive the holy ghost
[40:55] praise god amen
[40:57] so you've just got to realize that i
[40:59] i've got to get outside of my mind
[41:01] and get in the mind of christ and let
[41:03] god's power flow through me amen
[41:06] church we always got to be ready to pray
[41:08] the prayer of faith for somebody right
[41:10] if they're sick or discouraged or we got
[41:12] to be ready to
[41:13] say god uh we lay my hands on this
[41:16] person i trust you're going to touch
[41:17] them amen
[41:19] and just be ready and instant and always
[41:21] looking for the leadership of the holy
[41:23] spirit
[41:23] amen but i like you know in joshua 10
[41:27] we finally get to the spot where joshua
[41:29] has put all these
[41:30] uh these five kings under his feet and
[41:33] he's literally
[41:34] got them under his feet amen today we
[41:36] don't we don't fight our we don't fight
[41:38] people to get them under our feet
[41:39] physically
[41:40] but we we speak the word against devils
[41:43] to put them under our spiritual feet
[41:45] praise god amen
[41:46] amen and so once joshua finally gets to
[41:49] that spot where he's
[41:50] he's got the victory he tells the rest
[41:53] of the people now listen
[41:54] he said moses has told me this god has
[41:57] told me this the officers have told me
[41:58] this
[41:59] now i'm telling you this praise god in
[42:01] other words he became
[42:03] what the word of god said he would
[42:04] become amen amen he could say
[42:07] he could say like uh jesus this day this
[42:10] scripture is fulfilled amen
[42:13] i've got the power amen how do you know
[42:15] he got the power because he moved back
[42:17] the devil amen
[42:18] how do you know you got the power
[42:20] because you move back sin
[42:22] unbelief and lies you overcome it you
[42:25] conquer it by the blood of jesus amen
[42:27] that's how you know you got the power
[42:29] amen that's why i
[42:30] that's why sometimes you may hear me you
[42:32] may hear me bring up how the lord help
[42:34] me to be
[42:34] uh porn pictures and and cussing and
[42:38] evil movies and sports
[42:40] and cigarettes now why do you hear me
[42:41] bring that up because those are
[42:43] memorials amen
[42:45] those are memorials god was strong with
[42:47] me then they're encouraging me praise
[42:48] god
[42:49] that the god that was with me there the
[42:51] god that brought down all those demons
[42:53] is the one who's gonna help me overcome
[42:55] this demon amen
[42:58] what they got that's why the bible
[42:59] that's why joshua said you set up these
[43:00] memorials here
[43:01] and when the children ask what is this
[43:03] all about you tell them praise god
[43:05] amen you tell them god is real
[43:09] god brought me through it and he'll
[43:11] bring you through it amen
[43:14] that's what we need today we need the
[43:16] power of the holy spirit
[43:17] in our lives amen we need to remember
[43:20] what he's already done
[43:21] and know that he's faithful and he'll
[43:23] continue doing
[43:24] what he's already done amen now
[43:27] he became you know he spoke it he heard
[43:31] he just he kept meditating on god's word
[43:34] until it became a
[43:35] reality amen that's what i'm doing you
[43:37] know
[43:38] that's what you're doing with our loved
[43:39] ones right we're speaking god's word
[43:42] until it becomes a reality until they
[43:44] accept christ
[43:45] amen if god would grant them salvation
[43:48] we don't know
[43:48] but we are just confessing many of these
[43:50] promises and we're just speaking it and
[43:52] we're just believing god's word
[43:54] until it happens amen and we've got to
[43:58] be willing to do that now whether we're
[43:59] sick
[44:00] like jose's recently spoke to that
[44:02] glaucoma devil amen
[44:04] hallelujah praise god you just speak
[44:06] god's word amen
[44:08] speak the word and go forward god told
[44:11] moses
[44:12] glory and joshua he experienced the same
[44:14] i love it praise god
[44:16] now i've adjusted this a little bit but
[44:18] remember the steps
[44:21] if we want to be strong how many want to
[44:22] be strong in the lord amen
[44:24] god told joshua these three steps uh
[44:28] repent right uh i think
[44:31] yeah humility was the right word there
[44:33] yeah humility
[44:35] we saw that with paul paul said when i'm
[44:37] weak then i'm strong
[44:39] right in church we know this now
[44:41] repentance is a part of this because
[44:42] brother
[44:43] tells us if we don't confess devils a
[44:45] legal right to stay in our lives
[44:49] so repentance has to be on top amen
[44:52] because satan has a right if you've
[44:53] allowed a demon in and you don't confess
[44:56] it and you let him sit there
[44:57] then he's got every right to stay there
[45:00] he's got every right to sit in your
[45:01] house and
[45:02] spoil all your goods and eat your peanut
[45:04] butter and jelly sandwiches and
[45:06] and eat your chicken he's got every
[45:08] right to sit there and spoil your faith
[45:10] or your joy
[45:11] right or your patience he's got every
[45:13] right to spoil that but as soon as you
[45:15] confess that
[45:15] and as soon as you get your muscles back
[45:17] strong man
[45:19] as soon as you get your muscles back
[45:20] strong woman praise god
[45:22] you can bind him with the word of god
[45:25] with the name of jesus and you can cast
[45:27] him out praise god
[45:29] but other than that he's got every legal
[45:31] right to stay right there
[45:33] that's why we've got to confess our sins
[45:34] praise god
[45:36] so if we want to be strong we've got to
[45:38] repent and we've got to expose
[45:40] any uh evil influence on our lives and
[45:42] be humble
[45:43] paul said i have no strength he said but
[45:45] jesus
[45:46] i'm i'm weak then i'm in strong because
[45:49] he's given me the strength
[45:51] my grace is sufficient praise god amen
[45:54] now and then remember god told joshua he
[45:57] said only be strong
[45:59] and he said he said i will be with you
[46:02] i'll never leave you nor forsake you how
[46:04] many know he's with you today
[46:07] how many know he he gave you an angel
[46:09] escort to church praise god
[46:11] i know he gave me about three times a
[46:12] hydroplane i don't know about the
[46:14] lands or anything like that i don't know
[46:15] about brian and george but about three
[46:17] times a hydroplane i was going off the
[46:19] road
[46:20] so i thank god for the angel escort
[46:22] jesus amen
[46:23] thank you for protecting me and thank
[46:25] you because without him i can do nothing
[46:27] praise god amen
[46:29] if there's any good thing that happens
[46:31] it was christ amen
[46:32] amen and so he's always with us praise
[46:35] god
[46:36] and he's always uh trying to work his
[46:38] his will
[46:39] through our lives but we have to
[46:41] remember that he's with us amen
[46:44] we got to repent and remember his
[46:45] promises that he he has it like bone man
[46:48] said he hasn't thrown us on the scrap
[46:49] heap
[46:51] he said that in the statue perfect man
[46:52] he said when people forfeit their faith
[46:54] like judas he said they go on the scrap
[46:56] heap of ministers now we've seen a lot
[46:58] of that lately around the message
[46:59] haven't we
[47:00] but i'm not going to the scrap heap i'm
[47:01] going to the promised land praise god
[47:04] i'm not going to the scrappy i'm going
[47:05] further up the pyramid amen
[47:08] hallelujah i'm on the king's highway
[47:10] praise god
[47:11] i'm not on the devil's scrap deep amen
[47:13] i'm walking on the king's highway
[47:15] amen they can forsake it if they want
[47:18] they can blaspheme this picture if they
[47:20] want they can blaspheme
[47:22] the word of god if they want they can
[47:24] blaspheme the seventh angel
[47:26] they want but we won't we'll honor god
[47:28] we'll honor jesus christ
[47:30] we'll recognize his word we'll believe
[47:32] it we'll act on it we'll live it praise
[47:35] god
[47:36] amen hallelujah and so they fall in this
[47:40] scrap heap of ministers
[47:42] and it proves because they never had
[47:44] temperance to begin with right
[47:46] some of them that commit adultery and
[47:48] and uh all these
[47:49] wicked things they let worldly music
[47:52] into their homes
[47:52] it shows they never had the stature of
[47:54] perfect man to begin with amen
[47:56] they never had enough knowledge to know
[47:58] why women shouldn't cut their hair they
[48:00] never had enough knowledge of the word
[48:01] to understand that
[48:02] what a shame it shows they never had it
[48:05] they were never that strong to begin
[48:07] with what hung on it must have been a
[48:09] religious spirit all those years
[48:13] now the other thing is it could have
[48:14] been they had it and then they forfeit
[48:15] it
[48:16] right like israel they made it all the
[48:18] way up to kadesh but then they backslid
[48:21] right you can make some serious ground
[48:24] but then you can forfeit it
[48:26] right so either way but that's them
[48:29] that's not us
[48:30] we know he's with us amen i know he's so
[48:33] much with me he's not just with me
[48:35] he's in me amen because i see him take
[48:39] over my lips
[48:40] amen i see him take over my thinking
[48:42] amen
[48:43] i see him take over my actions praise
[48:45] god i see him bring me inspiration amen
[48:49] i see him bring me thoughts and prayers
[48:51] and and dreams and songs amen
[48:54] i see him do what he said the bible said
[48:56] he would do amen
[48:58] because it's a living book praise god
[49:02] so you repent you remain humble trust in
[49:04] his power
[49:05] you remember that he's always faithful
[49:08] and then you keep all the commands
[49:10] god told joshua just keep every word of
[49:12] it
[49:13] amen i didn't hear you
[49:16] that's where these message people get so
[49:18] weak oh i can't keep all of it
[49:20] why not there's only one thing you need
[49:22] to keep all of it
[49:23] love paul said love keeps off the
[49:25] commands amen
[49:27] it's not like you gotta have this and
[49:28] that you just need one thing
[49:31] love and jesus said love is the greatest
[49:33] commandment amen
[49:35] huh they make it so hard wow this is
[49:38] so difficult just fall in love with
[49:40] jesus
[49:41] if you just fall in love with jesus if
[49:44] you just get born again
[49:45] by the holy spirit you'll love holiness
[49:48] amen
[49:50] and you'll keep all the word remember
[49:51] church there's 616 laws in the old
[49:54] testament
[49:55] and paul said love fulfills all of them
[49:59] go ahead and try most you can't most of
[50:01] me i can't even remember
[50:02] the first ten commandments who's got it
[50:04] memorized here maybe a couple people
[50:05] may god bless you if you do but who can
[50:07] remember all 616
[50:09] but the nice thing is we don't have to
[50:11] remember we just got to remember
[50:13] love god with all your heart soul mind
[50:16] and strength and love your neighbor as
[50:18] yourself
[50:19] amen amen he makes it so easy
[50:22] just get the love of god and that's the
[50:24] power the love to keep all the commands
[50:28] and that's what joshua did he kept
[50:30] speaking he kept hearing people talk
[50:31] about be strong
[50:32] be strong he kept hearing it so much so
[50:34] he became it amen
[50:36] hallelujah that's what we're gonna be
[50:39] we're gonna keep talking about the
[50:40] rapture
[50:41] and talking about the holy ghost and
[50:43] talk about the promises of god
[50:44] until we go in the rapture amen amen
[50:48] whether through death or body change
[50:50] i'm going there i'm determined amen
[50:53] my mind is made up amen this home is not
[50:56] my world amen
[50:58] hallelujah heaven is my home amen
[51:01] because that's where my father is amen
[51:04] that's my homeland church
[51:06] i came out of god i was chosen in christ
[51:08] so that's my homeland
[51:10] god almighty amen
[51:13] and then he said you meditate upon them
[51:16] day and night
[51:17] you just talk about when you text
[51:18] somebody text them the word right well
[51:20] how was your week in the lord what'd you
[51:21] study
[51:22] love you in the lord you know just just
[51:24] keep on keep the word of god
[51:26] constantly on your mind and he said
[51:28] you'll finally find success in your life
[51:31] how do you want to be successful amen
[51:33] hey man that's a clue
[51:35] now i want to show bro bam said here how
[51:38] did abraham get stronger i just want to
[51:39] look at a few simple quotes
[51:42] he said but god kept his promise with
[51:45] abraham
[51:46] because abraham kept faith in god
[51:51] so god wasn't forcing abraham to be
[51:53] strong abraham had to make the choice to
[51:56] be strong
[51:58] because god god will not force anyone to
[52:00] heaven nor will he force
[52:02] anyone to hell it's all your choice he
[52:04] said whosoever will
[52:05] amen right if not they could say on the
[52:08] day of judgment god you had favorites
[52:09] you
[52:10] you sent me to hell and i didn't want to
[52:12] go no
[52:14] nobody's going to say god is not a just
[52:15] judge right but man talks about that in
[52:17] first 1965
[52:18] he says no instead of getting weaker
[52:21] abraham got
[52:22] stronger oh that ought to encourage us
[52:24] as we get a little older praise god
[52:27] he went from 75 to 100 and each year
[52:30] he got a little stronger
[52:34] praise god yeah our bodies get weaker
[52:37] but his spirit got stronger praise god
[52:40] amen now that's what we've got to make
[52:43] sure we got to make sure each
[52:44] year we make it a little more tired we
[52:46] make it a little more gray
[52:48] right but we've got to get a little more
[52:50] stronger with our faith
[52:53] praise god if he could do it amen under
[52:55] the blood of bows and goats then surely
[52:57] the blood of jesus christ has made a way
[53:00] that we can get stronger in faith year
[53:02] after year amen
[53:03] amen hallelujah
[53:07] the bible said he was stronger
[53:10] given god praise he knowed it was going
[53:12] to happen
[53:15] see because god told him he had a
[53:17] revelation
[53:18] right no matter how long it lingers it's
[53:21] going to happen going to happen
[53:22] like people would say oh the bible said
[53:24] it's no different from the time our
[53:25] fathers fell asleep oh i've heard the
[53:27] coming of the lord since i was a kid
[53:29] i've heard brother and since i was a kid
[53:31] my mother said she heard her mother talk
[53:32] about it
[53:33] there's no such thing but the bible said
[53:36] he was not
[53:37] weak in faith the bible said he didn't
[53:40] even look at his own body amen
[53:42] oh let's stop looking at our bodies
[53:44] let's start looking at the word amen
[53:47] always keep your eyes on the word you
[53:49] can't look at the sin you can't look at
[53:51] physical things you've got to look at
[53:53] eternal things amen
[53:55] in other words you've got to have
[53:56] spiritual eyes amen
[53:58] so you can understand spiritual things
[54:00] praise god
[54:03] he said when he was about a hundred
[54:04] years old neither the deadness of
[54:06] sarah's womb he was dying
[54:07] his wife's womb was dead and he said i'm
[54:10] not even considering that
[54:12] talk about a holy roller amen
[54:16] everybody else say no father of nations
[54:19] huh father nations no children he said
[54:22] glory to god it's thus saith the lord
[54:24] amen
[54:26] hallelujah god himself told me not saith
[54:30] the lord amen
[54:32] hallelujah and god himself said thus
[54:34] saith the lord we've seen our last sight
[54:37] amen
[54:38] and we've made ourselves ready by
[54:40] recognizing the last sign
[54:42] amen the discernment of the second poll
[54:45] amen
[54:46] the last sign he said thus saith the
[54:49] lord the last sign
[54:50] before the body change like genesis
[54:53] 17 amen right where god came and
[54:56] discerned sarah's heart
[54:58] behind the back the last sign the last
[55:00] time god visited
[55:02] before he visited for the final time
[55:04] amen
[55:05] the body change amen that's right
[55:09] so he staggered not uh yet he staggered
[55:11] at abimelech
[55:13] huh he's staggering out this proves
[55:16] we're perfect in heaven although
[55:18] imperfect on earth
[55:20] hallelujah praise god like job
[55:24] god is saying job god's in heaven god
[55:26] job is perfect
[55:27] job is perfect job is perfect and on
[55:29] earth god rebukes him amen
[55:32] and said you shouldn't have said this
[55:34] you must repent and ashes
[55:36] see that that's the difference between
[55:38] heaven and earth in heaven we don't
[55:40] stagger
[55:41] all god sees is the blood of jesus
[55:43] making us pure
[55:44] making us wine making us believers amen
[55:47] making us strong
[55:49] in faith amen so don't be discouraged if
[55:52] you haven't been strong for a few weeks
[55:54] days months or years if the if you're
[55:57] under the blood of jesus christ
[55:59] god doesn't see that he sees you coming
[56:01] to church and he sees you as you're
[56:02] staggering not
[56:04] at the plan of god amen you don't
[56:06] stagger
[56:07] you don't stumble because you're
[56:08] forgiven and you keep going
[56:12] you don't give up you keep going he
[56:14] didn't trip
[56:15] at the promise of god he didn't stumble
[56:18] over it and say i give up
[56:19] he said i believe it i'm going through i
[56:22] started with jesus
[56:23] and i'm going through
[56:28] that's what we are we're the seed of
[56:30] abraham and that's not just a quote from
[56:32] brother branham
[56:33] that's a quote from saint brother paul
[56:35] praise god
[56:37] brother paul gave us that quote any man
[56:40] or woman
[56:41] that has faith in jesus christ is the
[56:44] seed of abraham amen
[56:48] but he was strong in faith giving
[56:52] total silence to god in church is that
[56:54] what it says
[56:57] no the bible said he was giving glory
[57:00] i give you glory god you're gonna bring
[57:03] this to pass i don't know how you're
[57:05] gonna do it
[57:06] but your promise is yea and amen i know

[57:12] rapture coming

[57:26] he had a backbone praise god he wasn't a
[57:29] wimp praise god
[57:30] he was strong and he always gave god
[57:33] praise

[57:35] message thank you lord i give you glory
[57:38] thank you for sending me the holy ghost
[57:40] baptism message amen
[57:42] hallelujah thank you for sending me the
[57:44] message of the seven church age amen
[57:47] thank you for sending me the restoration
[57:52] message
[57:54] the bible's restored back to who it was
[57:57] brother brian

[58:00] but we've got the apostolic pattern
[58:03] restored back to us amen
[58:07] hallelujah
[58:10] we go as we're led by the holy spirit
[58:13] because they that are the children of
[58:15] god
[58:15] are led by the by the holy spirit they
[58:18] are the sons of god
[58:20] now he was partially persuaded
[58:25] that when he had promised maybe he was
[58:27] going to perform it
[58:30] goodness gracious no he was fully
[58:32] persuaded
[58:34] right service after service word after
[58:37] word
[58:38] the word convinced him and he grew
[58:40] stronger
[58:41] knowing i know god's going to bring this
[58:43] to pass i see
[58:44] all these uniting signs amen i see all
[58:48] the
[58:48] modern events making prophecy clear amen
[58:52] hallelujah that's what we see today
[58:54] praise god lord willing i was
[58:56] listening to some videos yesterday lord
[58:59] willing if i want to do this too for the
[59:01] the false prophets i want to bring out
[59:02] all these false prophets that they were
[59:04] talking about
[59:04] chronovirus the presidency and then all
[59:06] the other ones there's a bunch of them
[59:08] just to kind of give you some uh just to
[59:10] kind of give you a heads up we've got to
[59:12] be very careful who we listen to
[59:14] praise god going to be very lit very
[59:16] careful what we sing and
[59:18] who we follow and everything like that
[59:20] be very careful
[59:21] let me just tell you the one i was
[59:22] looking at uh
[59:25] paula white she was trump's advisor now
[59:28] i like trump
[59:28] some in some ways i voted for him
[59:32] but his do you know his his uh religious
[59:36] advisor was paula white
[59:37] do you know she's been married three
[59:38] times and do you know
[59:42] her and her husband say it's okay for a
[59:43] couple to watch porn together
[59:45] now that's straight from hell
[59:50] i thought i thought there was a mouse
[59:52] back there somebody i thought i heard
[59:53] like a mouse chirping back there sir
[59:56] now he might be brother or trump seemed
[59:59] like a good man now
[1:00:00] i'm just saying i forgot about that
[1:00:04] i forgot i was like man and there's so
[1:00:07] many other
[1:00:08] false prophecies that these people gave
[1:00:09] we got to be very careful
[1:00:12] now i've never listened to a paula white
[1:00:14] sermon and i don't plan on it
[1:00:16] but i do like trump and i do follow him
[1:00:18] you know and
[1:00:19] what is it called telegram i follow him
[1:00:21] down on telegram because they kicked him
[1:00:23] off all the other ones
[1:00:24] just like they're going to kick you off
[1:00:27] right because they're gonna eventually
[1:00:28] kick us off on youtube
[1:00:29] just for teaching the truth that's fine
[1:00:31] youtube doesn't save us the blood of
[1:00:32] jesus christ saves us
[1:00:34] praise god but i just thought wow it's
[1:00:37] so close to that we gotta be very
[1:00:38] careful what we're listening to
[1:00:40] praise god we're going to be very
[1:00:42] careful so i want to bring out some of
[1:00:43] just so you're aware some of these
[1:00:45] i was just shocked some of the things i
[1:00:46] heard people say
[1:00:49] uh someone on her show paula white
[1:00:51] someone on paula white's show was saying
[1:00:52] jesus is not the only begotten son of
[1:00:54] god he said because we're all begotten
[1:00:56] sons of god
[1:00:58] and she was like come on amen that's
[1:01:00] total heresy
[1:01:02] john 3 16 says he's the only begotten
[1:01:04] son
[1:01:06] they're talking about a son from a
[1:01:07] virgin womb that's what he's talking
[1:01:09] about
[1:01:10] we know we're begotten by the holy ghost
[1:01:12] amen
[1:01:13] i'm born again amen i'm begotten of god
[1:01:17] but not through the natural womb
[1:01:18] but through god's spiritual will amen
[1:01:22] yeah god's my mother and my father yes
[1:01:24] he's both praise god
[1:01:25] amen but she's like sitting there amen
[1:01:28] oh yeah amen he's not the only begotten
[1:01:31] that's that's that's from hell right
[1:01:34] that's a lie
[1:01:36] but the spirit of truth directs you to
[1:01:38] the word amen
[1:01:39] amen so i just want to let you know i've
[1:01:41] just
[1:01:42] seen some different thoughts on that and
[1:01:44] as much as i like trump
[1:01:45] i don't like pence much anymore because
[1:01:47] of what he did
[1:01:49] i still like trump a little bit praise
[1:01:51] god
[1:01:53] now so i just want to see well
[1:01:56] where where does abraham's testimony
[1:01:58] come in well we know he confessed his
[1:01:59] sins and
[1:02:01] he remembered our faith you know god i
[1:02:02] love this god came to him time and time
[1:02:04] to remember
[1:02:06] to remind him that he was gonna do this
[1:02:08] right
[1:02:09] all you gotta do is go to genesis 12
[1:02:11] genesis 13
[1:02:12] genesis 17 genesis 18 god keeps coming
[1:02:15] back and said i'm gonna give you a seed
[1:02:17] you're the father of nations and church
[1:02:19] that's how it is with us
[1:02:20] we would stumble we'd stagger but god is
[1:02:23] going to remind us
[1:02:24] amen god is going to keep bringing his
[1:02:26] word he's going to keep delivering it to
[1:02:28] us
[1:02:28] he's going to keep serving us up his
[1:02:30] word and we just got to receive it
[1:02:32] he's going to remind us of his
[1:02:34] faithfulness he's going to keep healing
[1:02:36] our sick praise god
[1:02:37] he's going to keep casting out devils
[1:02:39] amen he's going to keep
[1:02:40] filling people with the holy ghost amen
[1:02:43] he's going to remind us of his power
[1:02:46] and we've got to keep the commands i see
[1:02:49] he was constantly speaking glory
[1:02:51] glory i'm going to get a son glory i'm
[1:02:53] going to get him son
[1:02:54] glory i'm going to get a son through
[1:02:56] sarah sarah is a part of the promise
[1:02:58] glory
[1:02:58] even though we've got deadness in our
[1:03:00] bodies our reproductive
[1:03:03] bodies are they're dead but god is going
[1:03:05] to bring him back to life amen
[1:03:07] he just kept giving god glory one day
[1:03:10] thank god
[1:03:10] death is going to swallow this by this
[1:03:12] death up in life amen
[1:03:14] life is going to swallow up this body
[1:03:17] amen death will be swallowed up in life
[1:03:21] keep quoting the church it's going to
[1:03:22] happen praise god whether we do it live
[1:03:25] or whether we do it from the grave and
[1:03:26] we get there first
[1:03:27] it's going to happen yeah now look what
[1:03:30] it says you see now they the sinners
[1:03:33] they go out eat drink and be married
[1:03:36] see that they go out and start off
[1:03:37] because why there's never been any
[1:03:39] confirmation
[1:03:40] of it in their heart yet but when once
[1:03:44] god confirms that in your heart
[1:03:45] if you're a real seed of abraham instead
[1:03:47] of getting weaker as you see the days go
[1:03:49] by
[1:03:50] you'll get stronger all the time
[1:03:54] hallelujah church members that don't get
[1:03:58] stronger
[1:03:59] something's wrong they went off the holy
[1:04:01] ghost and they started feasting on the
[1:04:03] natural things
[1:04:04] caring too much about the natural more
[1:04:06] than the spiritual
[1:04:08] amen praise god
[1:04:11] if you're getting weaker spiritually
[1:04:13] it's because you're too
[1:04:15] you're getting stronger physically right
[1:04:18] you're
[1:04:18] you're you're flirting with the things
[1:04:20] of the world enjoying the things of the
[1:04:22] world too much
[1:04:23] praise god brother man tells us plainly
[1:04:26] this is about abraham
[1:04:27] how many still believe they're abraham's
[1:04:28] seed amen
[1:04:31] instead of getting weaker as you see the
[1:04:32] days go by you're getting stronger all
[1:04:34] the time
[1:04:35] you say well grandmother didn't see it
[1:04:37] mother didn't see it if i don't see it
[1:04:39] i'll be looking for it
[1:04:40] if i don't my children will see it i'm
[1:04:42] believing it
[1:04:43] i i fall asleep in the first second
[1:04:45] third watch he said either
[1:04:47] church age the first church age your
[1:04:48] last one those watches with your watches
[1:04:50] if i fall asleep in each one of them no
[1:04:52] matter where it is i awake
[1:04:54] in him that morning so i'm going to be
[1:04:57] ready believing that he's coming to this
[1:04:59] age
[1:05:00] hallelujah praise god i'll be happy
[1:05:04] to live the rest of my days and not see
[1:05:06] the rapture why because the rapture's
[1:05:08] already started inside of me praise god
[1:05:10] amen i've already heard the shout praise
[1:05:12] god amen
[1:05:14] that shout means a stimulating cry
[1:05:16] that's what it means it's a command
[1:05:18] it's a warning signal i've heard the
[1:05:20] first part of the rapture
[1:05:22] i've heard the shout go up make trim
[1:05:24] your lamps
[1:05:25] fill your oil with more fill your lap
[1:05:27] with more oil praise god amen
[1:05:30] go you out to meet him i'll be just as
[1:05:33] happy praise god
[1:05:34] to give the rest of my days another
[1:05:36] thing too because the word keeps opening
[1:05:39] each year brother saying god shows me
[1:05:41] more and more and more about his word
[1:05:44] like this week i just had a fresh
[1:05:45] revelation i always wondered why i was
[1:05:48] i never really quite understood the
[1:05:50] blasphemy of the holy ghost i knew it
[1:05:51] was calling
[1:05:52] uh you know something i knew it was
[1:05:55] calling the works of god and the devil
[1:05:56] but i'd
[1:05:57] i had kind of found the scripture i'd
[1:05:59] read it over
[1:06:00] and i just must have went like this
[1:06:01] which must went over my head
[1:06:03] but i was reading this week and mark and
[1:06:05] the bible jesus says that he said
[1:06:07] if you blast him the holy ghost he said
[1:06:09] it will not be forgiven you
[1:06:11] and then the very next verse says uh
[1:06:14] they blasphemed because they didn't have
[1:06:16] or because they called jesus that he had
[1:06:18] an unclean spirit
[1:06:19] now i'm really chopping that up so let's
[1:06:21] go read it please let's go read it here
[1:06:30] so it's mark chapter 3 i believe i'm not
[1:06:31] mistaken
[1:06:35] yeah it's 29 and 30. mark 3 29 30. i
[1:06:38] really
[1:06:38] i didn't have like a good understanding
[1:06:40] of that
[1:06:41] so what is blasting with the holy ghost
[1:06:43] it's calling the work of god
[1:06:45] of satan that's blasphemy
[1:06:48] right so where does it prove right here
[1:06:50] but he that shall blast him against the
[1:06:52] holy ghost hath never forgiveness
[1:06:54] but is in danger of eternal damnation
[1:06:56] because they said
[1:06:57] he had an unclean spirit and i said amen
[1:07:00] oh there it is right there
[1:07:01] i just i've i must have it must have
[1:07:04] slipped over my mind
[1:07:05] but see the bible says stir up your
[1:07:07] minds by way of remembrance
[1:07:09] that's right if you want to be stirred
[1:07:11] up if you want to be on fire again
[1:07:13] if you feel ashamed that you're not on
[1:07:14] fire get in god's word and help and
[1:07:17] he'll help you remember
[1:07:18] things amen that will help you in your
[1:07:20] life praise god
[1:07:22] amen hallelujah oh that was good to me i
[1:07:26] thought oh there it is mine
[1:07:27] i forgot all about that thank you jesus
[1:07:29] gave me a little give me a little
[1:07:30] simulation brother george
[1:07:32] a little stimulation by revelation i
[1:07:35] sure needed that
[1:07:36] that's right now here's two little
[1:07:39] images
[1:07:40] you know the bible gives us more than
[1:07:42] this but i just found two this morning
[1:07:43] and i just want to bring them out
[1:07:45] the bible says see now here it is you
[1:07:48] got to repent first right
[1:07:49] lay aside if you want to be strong i'm
[1:07:50] going to be strong
[1:07:52] lay aside all your malice your guile
[1:07:54] that's pretending
[1:07:56] hypocrisy right saying one thing doing
[1:07:58] the opposite envies are
[1:08:00] want to be like that person and all evil
[1:08:02] speaking don't say anything evil
[1:08:05] right you've got to lay aside you've got
[1:08:07] to repent of all your sins
[1:08:09] and as newborn babes desire the sincere
[1:08:12] milk of the word
[1:08:14] that you may grow thereby so see we're
[1:08:17] not going to grow
[1:08:18] unless we first confess our wrongs
[1:08:21] that's why people can come to message
[1:08:23] churches and they don't grow for days
[1:08:25] weeks months years decades
[1:08:28] because they get what i've seen when
[1:08:30] people leave the message they get
[1:08:32] complexes uh envyings or they get malice
[1:08:35] toward preachers
[1:08:36] or they speak evil and that's why they
[1:08:38] stop growing
[1:08:39] and pretty soon they just get used to
[1:08:41] not growing not being on fire for god
[1:08:43] and then pretty soon satan will
[1:08:45] have him shoot one of his arrows he
[1:08:46] builds up a complex and he shoots an
[1:08:48] arrow at somebody and then they start
[1:08:50] attacking the brothers in the message
[1:08:52] and now satan don't have to do much he
[1:08:53] let them fight
[1:08:55] hello and then they can't grow anymore
[1:08:59] they don't fall more in love with jesus
[1:09:00] they don't fast anymore they don't pray
[1:09:02] anymore they don't even witness anymore
[1:09:04] because they can't grow because they've
[1:09:06] cut off the food of god's word amen
[1:09:09] they've let devils move into their minds
[1:09:12] he said but this is how you grow
[1:09:14] confess all your sin and just start
[1:09:16] drinking on the milk of god amen
[1:09:19] hallelujah right just start drinking
[1:09:21] god's
[1:09:22] milk and grow up and pretty soon you'll
[1:09:25] grow up and you won't you
[1:09:26] won't get filled up on milk anymore then
[1:09:28] you need some meat praise god
[1:09:31] go to hebrews five yeah he responded
[1:09:33] that's where our memory verse was right
[1:09:34] no that was james 5. hebrews 5 forgive
[1:09:37] me
[1:09:39] now we've gone over this many times can
[1:09:41] preach it here last time he was here
[1:09:43] beautiful message that was a highly
[1:09:45] revelated message man
[1:09:46] that was straight from heaven i still
[1:09:48] believe that that message was straight
[1:09:49] from heaven
[1:09:50] and i thank the lord i think today's
[1:09:52] going to be too if we receive it praise
[1:09:54] god
[1:09:54] amen but like when cam was here we all
[1:09:56] got a poll if we all pull and pray we
[1:09:57] hear from heaven
[1:09:58] amen but that was a beautiful beautiful
[1:10:00] message my hebrews 5.
[1:10:05] now look at verse 14.
[1:10:08] but strong meat belonging to them that
[1:10:10] are full of full age even those who by
[1:10:13] reason of
[1:10:14] use have their senses exercised to
[1:10:16] discern both good and evil
[1:10:19] let me just share with brother shang
[1:10:20] here you know because he and i had a
[1:10:22] bible study yesterday two and a half
[1:10:23] hours brother
[1:10:25] just talking about the good things of
[1:10:26] god
[1:10:28] so when when a church and this is what
[1:10:30] we're a little bit we're talking about
[1:10:31] that's why i mentioned him
[1:10:33] he was concerned about churches not
[1:10:35] they're dying right many churches are
[1:10:37] dying
[1:10:38] when they stop trying to discern is this
[1:10:41] good or evil
[1:10:42] should i say this or should i watch this
[1:10:44] or should i do this when they stop and
[1:10:46] say oh
[1:10:47] it's all good when they stop doing that
[1:10:49] they start dying right there
[1:10:52] they instead of instead of feasting on
[1:10:54] the meat of god's word
[1:10:55] and growing into a strong man instead of
[1:10:59] growing into
[1:11:00] as a christian and judging whether
[1:11:02] things are right or wrong
[1:11:04] they backslide and they start withering
[1:11:06] away and dying
[1:11:08] you ever seen those big muslim builders
[1:11:10] brother shang but then if they stop
[1:11:12] lifting all that flab comes down you
[1:11:14] ever seen that and they got wrinkles
[1:11:15] have you guys ever seen that
[1:11:17] well maybe uh maybe i'm the only one
[1:11:18] that's seen it
[1:11:20] you know if you get big muscles that
[1:11:22] stretches out your skin right
[1:11:23] but if you stop lifting you get stretch
[1:11:26] marks on there
[1:11:27] and then your flab hangs down what
[1:11:30] happened why aren't they getting
[1:11:30] stronger
[1:11:31] they stop working out right they stop
[1:11:34] breaking down the muscles and
[1:11:35] and when people stop when people when
[1:11:37] churches stop breaking down doctrines
[1:11:41] when people's when churches stop
[1:11:43] breaking down trends
[1:11:45] in society right then their spiritual
[1:11:49] muscles break down
[1:11:50] and they can't tell if makeup is okay
[1:11:52] they can't tell if customs okay
[1:11:54] anymore they can't tell uh if if
[1:11:56] pornography is okay or not
[1:11:58] the sports they can't tell because they
[1:12:01] stopped
[1:12:02] building their muscles but if they just
[1:12:04] keep building
[1:12:05] they'd chew on that thought they'd go
[1:12:07] study the word
[1:12:08] and they pretty soon to find the bible
[1:12:10] says avoid all appearance of evil amen
[1:12:14] that's real meat brother george amen
[1:12:17] avoid
[1:12:17] all appearance of evil so if you see
[1:12:21] evil shun it walk away praise god
[1:12:24] with the churches today like by the amen
[1:12:26] saw out in wisconsin or minnesota
[1:12:28] they invite drinking into the basement
[1:12:30] of the church
[1:12:32] so cena shows they're not even drinking
[1:12:34] milk brothers and sisters
[1:12:36] because they don't even know is drinking
[1:12:38] okay in the house of god this is the
[1:12:39] only kind of drink and that well there's
[1:12:41] two kinds
[1:12:41] then that this and then there's the holy
[1:12:43] ghost wine praise god
[1:12:45] that's what you used to be drinking
[1:12:46] today praise god amen
[1:12:49] hallelujah amen actually actually two
[1:12:52] kinds of wine we should be drinking
[1:12:53] today
[1:12:54] a little sip of that because jesus said
[1:12:56] so
[1:12:58] because it's a figure it's just a symbol
[1:13:00] of what we should be doing the rest of
[1:13:01] the time
[1:13:02] yeah enjoying the world amen
[1:13:08] hallelujah praise god that's how you
[1:13:10] grow
[1:13:13] so they can't say it was jay-z right or
[1:13:15] not
[1:13:17] is it okay to listen to beyonce or not
[1:13:19] and they say no it's okay
[1:13:21] right there they stop growing right and
[1:13:24] they're gonna die
[1:13:25] right they're gonna get lost in sin and
[1:13:28] possibly go to hell
[1:13:29] because they stop because what does she
[1:13:31] bring in she brings in lusts
[1:13:33] and she brings in all kinds and now lust
[1:13:35] isn't in here but you well envy right
[1:13:37] yeah
[1:13:38] oh that person's got a more handsome
[1:13:40] husband than i who do and that that that
[1:13:42] woman's got a prettier
[1:13:43] that man's got a prettier girlfriend
[1:13:45] than i do see what that music does

[1:19:47] often i fear i battle that
[1:19:49] so i need the word of god to overcome
[1:19:51] amen
[1:19:53] now how do you build up your faith the
[1:19:55] bible says there's going to be
[1:19:57] mockers in the last time who walk after
[1:19:59] their own god
[1:20:00] they're going to be mocking christians
[1:20:01] but they can do they can fulfill all
[1:20:03] their lust they want
[1:20:05] now they separate themselves from the
[1:20:06] bride because they're sensual
[1:20:09] they don't have the holy spirit so that
[1:20:12] means some people are going to come in
[1:20:13] our churches
[1:20:14] pretty soon they're going to mock us and
[1:20:16] leave
[1:20:17] and the real reason they left is because
[1:20:19] they love the things of the world
[1:20:20] more than they loved the word of god
[1:20:23] they're going to leave
[1:20:24] sisterhood because they weren't born
[1:20:26] again but amen they're going to leave
[1:20:28] because they were more excited about
[1:20:30] worldly things than about the word
[1:20:33] oh my he said but ye beloved
[1:20:37] build up yourselves all right so we're
[1:20:39] talking about being strong right
[1:20:41] build up yourselves on your most holy
[1:20:43] faith how brother
[1:20:45] praying in the holy ghost
[1:20:48] oh my you want to be stronger pray more
[1:20:51] amen you want to be stronger pray more
[1:20:53] but pray in the holy spirit in other
[1:20:56] words don't tell god what to do
[1:20:57] say god here's what i want but let your
[1:21:00] will be done
[1:21:02] amen that's praying in the spirit
[1:21:03] letting god's will be done
[1:21:06] make your requests on unto god and then
[1:21:08] pray and say god let your will be done
[1:21:10] and lord
[1:21:10] keep me in your love amen
[1:21:14] help me to love those like shane was
[1:21:16] shane was
[1:21:17] talking with people that were speaking
[1:21:18] bad about me and it's okay buddy it's
[1:21:20] okay because i love them too
[1:21:21] and i've known that many people told me
[1:21:23] that so this week shane was talking with
[1:21:25] some people that
[1:21:25] you know they don't like me at all but
[1:21:27] you know what i love them
[1:21:29] and if they ever needed my help i would
[1:21:31] help them out
[1:21:33] and i and i've done that people that
[1:21:34] have left our church i've showed them
[1:21:36] love i've sent them gift cards i've told
[1:21:38] them i've greeted them with love i pray
[1:21:40] for them praise god
[1:21:41] any way that disagree with me the
[1:21:43] difference between us should be the love
[1:21:44] of god
[1:21:46] right now hopefully if someone disagrees
[1:21:48] you both got the love of god
[1:21:50] right right we've had that too we can
[1:21:52] still be holy ghostfield saints and
[1:21:53] disagree
[1:21:54] but either way we're to pray and if we
[1:21:57] want to we want to really show the love
[1:21:58] of christ
[1:21:59] we got to build up our faith and what is
[1:22:01] faith assurance
[1:22:02] so you pray amen you pray until you're
[1:22:05] assured in your heart
[1:22:06] you know in your heart god is with you
[1:22:08] amen and then the love of god
[1:22:11] moves you forward you keep yourself
[1:22:13] living in love even if god don't answer
[1:22:15] my prayers
[1:22:15] i still love everybody even if god
[1:22:18] doesn't do what i want to do
[1:22:20] i still love him amen and i'll still
[1:22:23] love my enemies
[1:22:25] praise god and i'll still say this
[1:22:27] father
[1:22:28] forgive them they don't know what
[1:22:30] they're doing that's real love
[1:22:32] that's the love of christ so he says
[1:22:35] pray in the holy ghost build yourself up
[1:22:38] pray in the spirit keep yourself make
[1:22:40] sure you're always in love with
[1:22:41] everybody
[1:22:43] that's why i don't understand why people
[1:22:45] more people can't smile if you got the
[1:22:47] love of god how can you not smile

[1:24:01] and i was scared to talk to rod bergen
[1:24:03] god knows my heart i was totally scared
[1:24:04] to do it
[1:24:07] but what happened the lord built me up
[1:24:08] in strength
[1:24:11] right i kept feasting on his word i just
[1:24:13] kept growing in his word
[1:24:15] and then god helped me to do things i
[1:24:16] never thought brother brian i'd be ever
[1:24:18] able ever to do a stuttering preacher
[1:24:21] like me
[1:24:22] a spitting preacher like me a forgetful
[1:24:24] preacher like me
[1:24:26] and yet that's the one god wanted to use
[1:24:28] i don't know how it worked out that way
[1:24:30] but i'm just saying look at your life
[1:24:32] for 2020. hopefully you can see
[1:24:34] growth amen and i'll say like this

[1:26:53] amen glory amen
[1:26:57] they keep building you up building up
[1:26:59] that's what builds up a believer

[1:27:03] dead sermon where they've got no holy
[1:27:05] ghost
[1:27:06] we need the power of the holy ghost amen
[1:27:08] we need the word of the holy spirit we

[1:27:27] some of us are over here give us some
[1:27:28] time we're eating on the meat
[1:27:29] that's why i have to preach sometimes

[1:29:08] that's the greatest will you could ever
[1:29:10] receive amen
[1:29:12] amen that jesus loves me
[1:29:15] and he granted me eternal life see i
[1:29:17] could do without the crown i could do

[1:29:41] hallelujah i didn't know i was going to
[1:29:44] preach like this today praise god
[1:29:47] gotta feel like i'm an evangelist today
[1:29:51] now this is what brother amen was
[1:29:52] thinking about build
[1:29:55] according to the grace of god which is
[1:29:57] given to me as a wise master builder
[1:29:58] i've laid the foundation and another
[1:30:00] build of their own so paul laid the
[1:30:02] foundation of the new testament right
[1:30:03] he taught the very first things you need
[1:30:05] to believe as a new testament believer
[1:30:06] but he said after that the preachers
[1:30:08] would build upon it oh glory
[1:30:11] yeah that's right we got to build for
[1:30:13] our generation we have a message
[1:30:14] our message is restoration
[1:30:16] [Laughter]
[1:30:18] so we're building that second to last
[1:30:20] piece right and then jesus is the lat
[1:30:23] he's the headstone that comes down from
[1:30:24] heaven glory i've never seen it like
[1:30:25] that before
[1:30:27] for other foundation can no man lay that
[1:30:29] is laid which is jesus christ
[1:30:31] yeah if any man build upon this
[1:30:32] foundation gold silver precious stones
[1:30:34] would hay stubble every man's work
[1:30:36] should be made manifest for they shall
[1:30:38] declare it
[1:30:39] because it is revealed by fire and the
[1:30:41] fire shall try every man's work of what
[1:30:43] sort it is
[1:30:44] if any man's work abide which he hath
[1:30:46] built upon he shall receive
[1:30:48] a reward in other words the fiery trials
[1:30:51] of this life are going to prove
[1:30:53] whether my ministry went whether i was
[1:30:55] building with the right materials or not
[1:30:57] praise god i'm trusting i am because i'm
[1:31:00] trying to give all you guys thus saith
[1:31:01] the lord praise god
[1:31:03] i'm trying to give you right out of here
[1:31:04] if it's my thoughts i'll tell you this
[1:31:05] is my opinion
[1:31:06] i think this is brother bran's opinion
[1:31:08] but when it comes right out of the word
[1:31:09] that ain't brother man's opinion that's
[1:31:11] thus saith the lord amen
[1:31:12] amen and that's a building stone amen
[1:31:15] that's a stone
[1:31:17] to build your life upon praise god
[1:31:20] if it's a word confession if it's a word
[1:31:22] stone build stone upon stone word upon
[1:31:25] word
[1:31:26] build it up it becomes a temple unto god
[1:31:29] that's what the bible says
[1:31:32] if your work abides when the fiery
[1:31:34] trials come you get a reward
[1:31:37] if any man's work shall be burned he
[1:31:38] shall suffer lost but he himself shall
[1:31:40] be saved
[1:31:41] so as by fire so there's gonna be a lot
[1:31:45] of people that go to heaven they don't
[1:31:46] have any reward they just get saved
[1:31:47] that's their only reward is to be saved
[1:31:50] that's all they get because the fire of
[1:31:53] the trials are gonna prove they didn't
[1:31:54] build with thus saith the lord thank god
[1:31:56] we got thus saith the lord my goodness
[1:31:58] thank god it's not thus saith the
[1:32:00] seminary can you imagine that brother
[1:32:01] john
[1:32:02] was trying to join johnny this is thus a
[1:32:04] doctor so-and-so
[1:32:06] oh my we got dr jesus praise god
[1:32:10] we got the best seminary there ever was
[1:32:12] heaven amen

[1:32:16] professor praise god
[1:32:18] the professor holy ghost is going to
[1:32:19] come in and teach us some lessons today
[1:32:22] i like that amen
[1:32:25] now therefore ye are no more strangers
[1:32:27] than foreigners
[1:32:30] but you're fellow citizens with the
[1:32:32] saints of the household of god
[1:32:33] and you are built see you are built upon
[1:32:35] the foundation of the apostles
[1:32:38] jesus christ in other words you and i
[1:32:40] are only as stable as the stones below
[1:32:43] us
[1:32:43] oh my that's why that's why they all
[1:32:45] shouted out brother brahm we're resting
[1:32:47] on the fact
[1:32:48] that you preach what paul preached amen
[1:32:51] because paul had laid the stones and
[1:32:53] then brother branham laid the stones
[1:32:55] and we're all standing on those stones
[1:32:58] brother you can't knock these stones
[1:32:59] down amen
[1:33:01] hallelujah because this is the rock this
[1:33:03] is the foundation rock amen
[1:33:05] let the storms come but these rocks are
[1:33:08] going to stand amen
[1:33:10] you can't move these rocks brother these
[1:33:12] are holy ghosts
[1:33:13] eternal rocks amen honey that's what
[1:33:16] we're resting on the bible says
[1:33:19] that's our foundation and the
[1:33:22] cornerstone of all of it is jesus
[1:33:25] so you keep going down okay where did
[1:33:27] luther rest on okay
[1:33:29] uh let me inspect this uh foundation
[1:33:31] okay uh what did
[1:33:32] polycarp okay okay we're almost on the
[1:33:35] bottom
[1:33:36] here's paul okay great now where's
[1:33:38] paul's foundation
[1:33:39] you go a little farther there's jesus
[1:33:43] it's jesus jesus is the foundation stone
[1:33:46] and then if you come back up there he is
[1:33:48] jesus is coming
[1:33:50] as the capstone amen he's the first and
[1:33:53] the last amen
[1:33:54] the alpha and the omega amen hallelujah
[1:33:58] just keep searching out pretty soon it's
[1:34:00] all going to come back yeah there's
[1:34:01] jesus there oh and there's jesus right
[1:34:03] there
[1:34:06] glory amen that's why everything we
[1:34:10] teach about shane can go right back to
[1:34:11] the bible
[1:34:13] because he's at the bottom he's gonna be
[1:34:15] at the top too
[1:34:18] praise god we meet him in the air
[1:34:21] god's own son will be the headstone one
[1:34:25] at the meeting
[1:34:30] in whom all the buildings so we're he's
[1:34:32] likening us now we're like a building
[1:34:36] we're fitly framed together we grow up
[1:34:38] into this holy temple of the lord
[1:34:40] in whom you're also building together
[1:34:42] for an inhabitation of god
[1:34:44] don't you know church that's what we're
[1:34:45] supposed to be we're supposed to be like
[1:34:47] a temple that god can sweep down in
[1:34:50] through here
[1:34:51] every service and that what the bible
[1:34:53] said
[1:34:54] we're supposed to be a dwelling place
[1:34:56] for the holy spirit
[1:34:58] i know it because brother amen will
[1:34:59] start singing i'll start feeling the
[1:35:00] spirit
[1:35:01] i'll start crying and praising the lord
[1:35:03] pretty soon i come up here i start
[1:35:05] preaching in the holy spirit
[1:35:06] and pretty soon the holy spirit's all
[1:35:08] around amen and he's trying to meet the
[1:35:10] needs of the saints amen
[1:35:13] might just be god wants you to give him
[1:35:15] glory today like abraham
[1:35:18] might be he wants to heal your body
[1:35:19] right like how many times brother jose
[1:35:21] been healed here
[1:35:22] praise god how many times mosey my
[1:35:24] goodness
[1:35:25] 10 15 20 times he's been healed by the
[1:35:27] holy spirit year after year
[1:35:30] remember her sister whoever when that
[1:35:31] you said you felt the wind of the holy
[1:35:32] spirit come
[1:35:33] through through that wall right there
[1:35:35] and healed you you were sick that day
[1:35:36] remember you got healed but brother amen
[1:35:37] was a little sick after that
[1:35:40] now sometimes i've been sick and god
[1:35:41] will heal somebody else right sometimes
[1:35:42] blame it i'll be sick and i'll pray for
[1:35:44] somebody they'll get healed and i won't
[1:35:48] because it's god working out his will
[1:35:50] for his glory
[1:35:52] jesus would heal people and then we know
[1:35:54] he got sick he went go he'd go out in
[1:35:55] the boat he'd be sick you know
[1:35:57] he it's all according to god's will god
[1:36:00] don't promise us everything we want
[1:36:01] but he gives us everything we need amen
[1:36:04] all right coming down to the final
[1:36:06] thoughts here well i didn't think i was
[1:36:08] gonna go this direction man
[1:36:10] thank the lord now the bible says
[1:36:13] as you have received christ jesus the
[1:36:15] lord walk in him
[1:36:17] yeah rooted
[1:36:20] and built up so now look you got both
[1:36:22] directions
[1:36:24] strange you're rooted you're growing
[1:36:26] down but you're also growing up like a
[1:36:28] wheat plant
[1:36:29] praise god did you know that they go
[1:36:32] both ways right
[1:36:34] i'm going both ways i'm going deeper in
[1:36:36] the depths of love i'm going higher in
[1:36:38] heavenly places all the time
[1:36:41] praise god
[1:36:44] i'm establishing the faith as you have
[1:36:47] been taught
[1:36:48] abounding there and with thanksgiving
[1:36:52] thank you for 2020 lord it was a
[1:36:53] blessing
[1:36:55] although i got coronavirus you'd slay
[1:36:58] the demon of coronavirus in my body
[1:37:00] praise god now i know 99.9 of people do
[1:37:04] but they they're just it's just a shame
[1:37:06] they don't recognize it was jesus amen
[1:37:08] i just happened to recognize it was
[1:37:10] jesus amen
[1:37:12] and i'll keep thanking him amen thank
[1:37:13] you jesus amen
[1:37:15] because we must give thanks in the name
[1:37:17] of the lord he's the only healer that's
[1:37:19] right
[1:37:20] i've yet to hear anthony fauci say he's
[1:37:22] a healer of chronovirus he's not
[1:37:25] jesus christ is the only healer of
[1:37:26] coronavirus
[1:37:30] so beware you don't get spoiled through
[1:37:33] man-made traditions things of the world

[1:37:38] better
[1:37:40] i i want to close with this i'm going to

[1:37:59] that was an hour so that was exactly now
[1:38:01] that's when it goes to this thought
[1:38:02] church if you're strong when you and i
[1:38:03] are strong
[1:38:04] there's nobody that can stand before us
[1:38:06] and defy jesus christ
[1:38:10] they'll come and stand there for a while
[1:38:11] like satan satan come and stood there
[1:38:12] before jesus for a while but pretty soon
[1:38:14] he had to go
[1:38:16] we know he's going to come it's not that
[1:38:17] people don't come and challenge you
[1:38:20] but the difference is that you don't let
[1:38:21] that devil in
[1:38:23] you send them away amen you don't let
[1:38:26] them take shop in your mind and start
[1:38:27] lusting
[1:38:28] or you know stealing or murdering or
[1:38:32] wrath no you send him back into dry
[1:38:35] places
[1:38:37] take all your lies and go back to hell
[1:38:39] where you came from
[1:38:41] go to dry places for you're not welcome
[1:38:44] here because i'm a soldier of the lord
[1:38:47] i'm fighting for jesus amen hallelujah
[1:38:50] i'm a strong christian praise god i'm
[1:38:52] not a weak christian i'm not a foolish
[1:38:54] virgin
[1:38:54] i'm a wise virgin amen i know how to
[1:38:57] handle this praise god
[1:39:01] that's what people are asking no well
[1:39:02] why do we need brother brother they're
[1:39:03] asking that on youtube this morning why
[1:39:04] we need brother brown
[1:39:05] because he directs us to the word of the
[1:39:07] day in other words he directs us for the
[1:39:10] tools of today
[1:39:12] amen praise god he gives us the tools
[1:39:14] which are the revelations right
[1:39:17] because the the mysteries are finished
[1:39:19] in this day
[1:39:20] right and we partake of them they're
[1:39:22] honey in our mouth but they're
[1:39:23] bitter in our belly and when we eat them
[1:39:25] they're billet they're bitter
[1:39:27] but they make us go speak it again right
[1:39:29] we speak it again we keep speaking it
[1:39:31] we share it we eat it we become it just
[1:39:33] like joshua
[1:39:34] pretty soon we start speaking it amen
[1:39:38] when we meditate upon it when we speak
[1:39:40] it when we listen to it
[1:39:42] it just becomes us and we speak the
[1:39:44] revelation of god
[1:39:45] wow hallelujah amen
[1:39:50] so joshua if you read joshua chapter 12
[1:39:52] i don't expect you to read that
[1:39:54] in fact haven't you read it recently
[1:39:57] i read it you know a couple months ago i
[1:39:59] was making through my way through the
[1:40:00] old testament
[1:40:00] he defeated 31 kings saints 31 kings
[1:40:07] and only two men that i found could
[1:40:08] stand before him
[1:40:10] all the days of his life just two
[1:40:13] think about that someone gave a
[1:40:14] testimony about you shang was a mighty
[1:40:16] warrior for jesus
[1:40:17] he only really stumbled twice my i would
[1:40:20] rejoice if somebody said that about
[1:40:22] if jesus said that about me he only
[1:40:23] stumbled twice glory remember with david
[1:40:25] the bible said he only really stumbled
[1:40:26] with bathsheba
[1:40:28] right where he purposely disobeyed god's
[1:40:30] word
[1:40:32] god help us i just want you to be
[1:40:35] encouraged
[1:40:37] 31 right 31.
[1:40:40] now here's what i want to just show this
[1:40:42] i made a list a few years ago
[1:40:44] and will this help if i yeah that would
[1:40:48] help
[1:40:50] church how many do you believe you're in
[1:40:51] the central promised land
[1:40:53] amen now here's just 14 church
[1:40:57] here's just 14 demons now think about
[1:40:59] this if you kept god's word this year
[1:41:01] or you know the last few months if these
[1:41:04] temptations came to you
[1:41:05] and you resisted them you did the same
[1:41:08] thing joshua did
[1:41:10] sometimes we forget how strong god has
[1:41:13] actually made us
[1:41:15] when was the last time you got an evil
[1:41:16] you got someone trying to bring you a
[1:41:18] false
[1:41:18] prophecy they do it all the time right
[1:41:20] brother we talk about it they do it all
[1:41:22] the time trying to guess what the
[1:41:23] rapture is going to be here
[1:41:24] raps are going to be here donald trump's
[1:41:26] going to win thus saith the lord all the
[1:41:28] that's a that's a familiar spirit
[1:41:32] and look if we overcame that and we
[1:41:34] didn't get under that anointing what
[1:41:35] happened
[1:41:35] we just slew that devil we just defeated
[1:41:40] that king
[1:41:40] i'm not going to speak for god unless he
[1:41:42] puts a word in my mouth
[1:41:45] you might have been you might have been
[1:41:46] tempted to say something wrong you might
[1:41:48] have been tempted to
[1:41:49] uh falsely predict something but what
[1:41:51] came around the holy spirit came around
[1:41:53] you defeated that and you slew the enemy
[1:41:56] and there you stand victorious

[1:41:59] but i hope you understand what i'm
[1:42:00] saying spirit of
[1:42:01] divination right jealousy someone tried
[1:42:04] to make you jealous over somebody in the
[1:42:06] church
[1:42:06] but instead of getting jealous you got
[1:42:08] happy for him
