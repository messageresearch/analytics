[Music] we try to preach us a Hauer today Wednesday preached 43 minutes I think it was so that was quite a record for me so very thankful by God's grace but we're happy and that's really helped me I feel a lot stronger today by God's grace just for taking a little bit easy and trying to balance you know strength and everything like that balance all the areas of life so Revelation chapter 3 verse 3 just keep me in prayer you know I just you know we do it Bible club now we have over 70 kids that come every Friday every Thursday now and now we're starting to middle school Bible club on Tuesday morning at 7:15 so we're doing another ministry but we wanted to be in the will of the Lord now the middle school ones real small there's only like five middle schoolers coming but we're hoping by God's grace it'll go to high school then we can have a ministry in all the schools by God's grace and this this week I taught the Bible club on the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we're doing the three works of grace this month and we're inviting the kids to be baptized and like eight kids come up and wrote their names they want to be baptized so we contacted their parents and see if they want to be baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ so just try and do something for the Lord amen trying to spread his word try to work till Jesus comes amen so a revelation 3 verse 3 I'll read verse 3 and then we'll all read verse 4 verse 3 remember therefore how thou hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon me let's read verse 4 ready 1 2 3 now has a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy let's that word of prayer for him you know in your heart just make it known unto God as we go before the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father you see the hands Lord my hands up Lord humbly I have a need of you this morning Lord God I'm sure others have a need of you as well Lord God well we're reaching out in the spear that's one of the signs of being a hot Christian Lord a passion to know your word a desire a fervent desire to please you and a cry and the reaching out in the spirit all Holy Spirit we cry out to you this morning great Holy Spirit minister Lord God make us more like you Lord meet our needs this morning we're needy people we're trusting Lord your word to speak to us help me to be a vessel you can use help us to be vessels you can hear through help us to be clay that can be molded Lord God and pour the water upon us Lord God put us on the potter's wheel Lord to mold us and shape us Lord God into the fashion you'd have us to be Lord that we could be a vessel of honor today Lord God best every heart and soul Lord thank you for the sacrifice of the saints to come out to the house of the Lord dear God be with those livestreaming Lord Jesus and that may watch it also on the archive minister now by your Holy Spirit in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless yous being seated malkov slides and whenever you're ready buddy you can switch over by God's grace we have a lot to be thankful for don't we praise God a lot to be thankful for God is so merciful let's look at this Sardis and church age part 4 and we'll take this thought like I said an hour here by God's grace we'll try to be mindful the time we read our text and we're looking at this yellow the yellow words here the Sardis church age we preached all the way up here this is part 4 and Martin Luther course was the the messenger and Wednesday we looked at how it was an age of justification the Prophet said it was God restoring justification sanctification to Wesley and then the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our day praise God and brother Branham said it started with the depths of God and then it went to the depths of Satan so much corruption but the church sprang back to life through Martin Luther with a blade he said a blade sprung forth out of the ground and was coming back to the depths of God so we should feel our lives going deeper with God do you feel that by God's grace if not that we've got need to catch up or or check up rather and get right with God because that's the word of the Lord we are gonna have the same ministry that they had in the beginning the depth of God which is love for God which is obedience praise God which is letter the Holy Spirit walking in the spirit not walking the flesh praise God and that's just to summarize it from Wednesday but also I've made this I don't know everybody's seen it but I kind of overlap the church ages with the anointings of the horse rider so of course we're living I'm sorry preaching right now in this age we're preaching on it but we're living over here under the pale horse rider but the area we're preaching on here is the age of Sardis where it was the man anointing versus of the black horse rider praise God and that was him capturing the wealth of the world and so he had control of Satan had controlled the governments and the churches and everything and there was just a real little small group and the sin they had to overcome was living a named Jesus but being dead and how many believe we got to still overcome that today praise God we got to overcome the deeds the Nicolaitans and doctrines and false all these things we've still got to overcome we don't want to come to a church and say we're message but not have the life of the message we want to have the life of Christ amen we don't want to try to be living a name but be dead spiritually we want to be on fire amen by God's grace with as we said the three-fold manifestation of being on fire a fervent desire to please him a passion and know his word and then a cry for reaching out in the Holy Spirit amen Oh Holy Spirit move this and move this day praise God so there's our church age fifteen twenty two seventy fifty Martin Luther is the messenger and of course there's not much light to that age everyone had that we had the Eclipse last month brother Branham said the Eclipse represented that the church was no longer the mouthpiece of God and I wonder you know we just wonder I were not prophets or anything but you know with this eclipse going over the u.s. you know I think it's another obvious sign that the u.s. is not speaking for God right this country is is Burness last bridge we know in 1956 we know they turned on the revival but I think it's God showing again how this nation is under darkness praise God but the bride will always walk in the light amen so we see where we're at we're now at this fifth church age here and there's a little more light because Wesley is the age of the open door the Prophet said it was the greatest missionary age ever was the Philadelphian church age and then we come back to our day the Laodicean Church age amen memorable Graham said if God would ask me what day would you have lived and he said I would have chose the last church age he said because it's right at the coming of the Lord amen Olivia it's at the end of the age it's the time when when time will blend in with eternity praise God and he said I would have chose the last age praise God and so you have ie men have got to given a choice we would have chosen living this day praise God because we are ordained to be here praise God remember Sardis is this fist city here if you go around that oval there kind of like a oval kinda like a triangle if you go around there where that's the fist city and now in this church age we preach on the aged messenger salutation denunciation and warning today we'll look at the judgment and eulogy well look at these today by the grace of the Lord the judgment Jesus says remember therefore how thou hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know the hour I will come upon thee I think this is a very striking scripture here because Jesus telling the the people of Sardis remember how you receive the word how do they receive the word church they received it through Martin Luther they received it through other messengers and there's only one messenger rather but there's other earthly messengers or preachers they received it from men who were able to stand out against the denominational system of that day they received it as a fresh revelation my the just shall live by faith Jesus is saying remember how you receive the word and how you heard it and hold fast that word and he said repent now brother Branham said it's evident from this verse God has given them truth as a permanent deposit it was received and is irrevocably theirs it now remains to be seen what they will do with it whether they will regard it or not the same is true today are we going to regard the message what are we going to do with it how many have heard the message we've all heard it now what are we going to do with it praise God so see the Spirit would say the same thing today we've heard the word now how have you heard it what are you going to do with the word and we have to do something we all do something with the word whether we like it or not we all do something with it and we want to put it to use praise God and that is true they had been given the basic truth of the whole gospel the just shall live by faith amen that's the basic basic truth of salvation the just shall live by faith we're living by faith in Jesus Christ today salvation is of the Lord they had heard the truth of the Bible which cast down the doctrines of Rome and said it not all papal Authority they knew the truth that the church is not saved they understood the Lord's Supper they had light on water baptism they put out the images truth why there never was an age with any more men with so much light Amen phrase God what did they just was my all this light coming forward this blade of this is this blade of grass coming out of the ground or blade of the week coming out what a mighty age it was where light is springing forth out of almost pure darkness they had enough illumination to completely overhaul the old system or start out fresh and let God lead them line upon line and precept upon precept they receive the truth they wanted it and heard it but the question was how did they hear it did they hear to build upon or was it this with the same attitude that many Greeks had something to discuss and theorized over I hope that's not how we received it I'm going to go to acts 1712 because the Prophet reminds us of the Greeks of Acts chapter 17 and I think you know as time goes by you know we see many stand faithful to the message and then some fall away and we find many times that those who fall away just when they were attracted you know by by how the message was different like my wife and I talked many times and we've seen so many people come and go some people are attracted just because there's kind like a conspiracy theory some people love conspiracy theories and so we you know we reveal who the beast is and the the Antichrist is and some people get really excited about that right away and if they kind of because they kind of like conspiracy theories they do and then the Roman Catholic Church is this beautiful Church but like John wondered and he said all I admired what a beautiful church but then there's a conspiracy behind it it's Satan's church right and so people are attracted to that some are attracted because of the dress and they see holiness and other things like that other people are attracted because it's a smaller church you know the big churches have burned them and they want a more personal Church there's different things that attract people but when they fall away it's it's revealed that they only came to really discuss and theorize over the message they just came to hear something new they were tired of hearing you know things from their other denominations and some people come and they just want to just hear something new and when you stop preaching new things or not every sermons new people get discouraged but we must remember how many times Jesus said the word remember praise God we must remember things we've already heard are we living all that we've heard in most cases most people are not living all that they've heard can you say amen to that think about all that we've heard that brother Branham is preached all the tremendous words you know invincible army quotation from the church age book think of other things that we should be living great great compliments to the bride of Jesus Christ she'll be so much like him that she even takes his name amen Christians should be so much like Jesus that they take his name and people notice mine they act just like Christ amen now how many people are living that praise God there's such things that have been so highly attained brother Branham says if you hate your brother he said you're still not sealed yet and yet how many message searches hold people that might hate others from other churches you know we've heard such things at such a high life as far as high in heavenly places and we're able to get there if we obey the Word of God and if we live according to the word but we see a lot of people just want to hear something new all the time or they just want to theorize or they just want to intellectual stimulation rather than a soul simulation amen rather than a soul berth hallelujah so acts 17 12 he says therefore many of them believed also I'm sorry also of honorable women which were Greeks and a men not a few I'm sorry I think I read the wrong verse here on my neck 17 verse 12 oh yeah I'm sorry verse 21 I got my one and two mixed up sorry about that verse 21 for all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time and nothing else but either to tell or hear something new so Paul shows shows that give me an evil spirit when people just want to hear something new all the time just give me something new give me something new don't take me back to the old but Jesus said a master builder brings forth both new and old praise God sometimes me back and remember the words on justification on sanctification on the gifts of the Spirit on the supernatural sometimes need to go back there and visit there because we forget we're human we're if we forget and Jesus constantly says remember and repent remember and repent praise God so the Prophet tells us it's good to hear it but you got to make sure you hear it the right way praise God evidently the rich word of truth was being heard in an academic manner rather than for practical out working for God was demanding a change of mind concerning it so that's one way that you'll know if our ministry or any ministry is academic or intellectual they only require you to memorize it they don't require you to live it hey man because Jesus is demanding the Prophet said God's demanding a change so God is there demanding you must change you must repent and people get upset with the preacher says you must obey you must submit that get upset but the Prophet said that's what God demands he demands repentance praise God see that's how we know if we're intellectual or just want to hear something new all the time or it's actually spiritual because when it's spiritual God will demand you change your life and if you change then your spiritual if you don't then you're just an election will praise God that's what our prophet taught oh how many would say change my heart O God make it ever true amen help me to obey what the preacher saying amen no matter where I go help me to obey what the Word of God says if not it's just academic it's just intellectual which is a tragedy or tracks a lot of people a lot of people if this is the Word of God which idiot is that it must be obeyed failure to obey would bring judgment when the guards of the sacred temple were found sleeping they were beaten and their garments burned so they're on Nightwatch kind of reminds us of the message watchman one of the night I preached a few months ago right probably the Prophet liked it under preachers and prophets what shall the Lord do to those who in this age have relaxed their guard they're not staying awake you know spiritually and God their lives like they ought to be let's look at a few parables you have your Bible I don't have all these scriptures up here so let's turn your Bible to mark 13 34 if you got your Bible here let's say as soon as I read that I felt the Holy Spirit now that's just my thought I felt the Holy Spirit go to this parable and there's three there's two versions of it mark 13 34 and Luke 12 let's go to mark 13 34 mark 13 34 so God demands that we repent God demands that we change our minds God doesn't give us a word to hear it God wants us to live it amen and manifest it mark 13 34 he says this for the son of man is as a man taking a far journey who left his house and what he give to his servants Authority and he said to every man his work so God's servants have authority every man has a work for God and commanded the porter the gate keeper to watch now look at verse 35 he said watch ye therefore he speaking to his disciples disciples you need to watch for ye know not when the master of the house cometh or even or at midnight or at the cock-crowing or in the morning les coming suddenly he find you sleeping and I say unto you I'm sorry and what I say unto you I say unto all watch huh me know you're commanded to watch for the coming of the Lord and that doesn't mean guess when it's gonna be like next month or I believe in two years the raptures gonna take place I believe within ten years that that's not what he's talking about he's having your life ready where you would be happy to see him return amen your life is in such a state your life is like his life it's fully sold out you have a cross you actually have a burden for the gospel and you're bearing your cross you're working for Jesus and you can't wait till he gets here amen so you can show him how you've invested by His grace into his work for your life amen that's right remember when the servants came they came forth and showed oh look I've done I've doubled your talents Lord I've doubled your talents you gave me five here's ten you gave me - I'm giving you four they were ready to show him and the Bible said that God's reward is with Jesus when he returns he's got your reward rainy waiting there right with him amen oh yeah now notice the servants have authority every man has a work the porter must watch we all must watch now the the theologian Clark said a porter asleep exposes the house to be robbed and well deserves punishment no wonder that the man is constantly suffering loss who is frequently off his guard this is how you know you're not watching you're suffering loss of spiritual goods I didn't say natural goods I said spiritual goods amen you're suffering loss the blessings of God faith virtue knowledge patience temperance godless brotherly kindness if you're a born-again Christian you might be suffering the loss of the fruits of the spirit right or the armor of God you don't feel like you can hold that that sort of the spirit anymore your your Shield of faith is getting heavy you can't handle the attacks upon you that's how you know you've let your guard down is if you're constantly suffering spiritual loss instead of suffering instead of enjoying spiritual gains your suffering loss how many one a gain in Christ amen examine your hearts this morning see am i gaining spiritually or am I losing spiritually now you know if you're sleeping or not now you know Jesus is parable am i dozing off to sleep trying to stay awake and I'm not talking about naturally in the service today which I don't see anybody dozing off this morning but I'm talking about spiritually sleeping spiritual err as to what's going on in God's economy amen and then he says to find you sleeping sleeping is inattentive to your posts neglecting your duty and unprepared for God's coming and the Bible lists there's four watches there's an evening watch a midnight watch a cock-crowing watch and a morning watch and Jesus said be ready at all for watches amen that reminds me of the four annoying things they're on the of the beasts man we must have the morning watch or something amen but you understand we must be ready for his coming praise God now go to Luke chapter 12 it's gonna loot 12 and it was verse 35 12 35 before this a little bit more lengthy reading there's a little more details in this parable praise God Luke 12 35 Luke 12 35 this is why I love the church ages it's so applicable to every age every age goes through these things and each age of course you know God emphasized a little more heavily for each age but we can all relate to this we can all relate to being uh wanting to watch and pray right we can all relate to that so this is so applicable to all of us Luke 12 35 let your loins be girded about and your lamps burning how many know what loins are it's a ready mind have your mind ready thinking about the things of God and we know what the lamps represent the burning of the Holy Ghost the anointing of the Holy Ghost right with the the ten virgins right five wise five foolish that your lights be burning don't let your lights go out shine the light for Christ verse 36 and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their Lord when he returned from the wedding that when he cometh and knocketh they may open unto him immediately blessed are those servants whom the Lord when he cometh shall find watching verily I say to you that he shall gird himself and make them to sit down to meet and will come forth and serve them and if he should come in the second watch or in the third watch and find them so blessed are those servants and this know that if the good man of the house had known what hour the thief would have come he would have watched and not suffered his house to be broken through be he therefore ready also for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not then Peter said unto Him Lord speakest thou this parable unto us or even to and the Lord said who then is that faithful wise steward whom his Lord shall make ruler over his house to give them their portion of meat in due season blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find him so doing so God wants servants to give the people their food for that particular season amen and then Jesus wants to find us feeding his people verse 44 of a truth I say to you that he will make him ruler over all that he hath but and if that servant saying is hard my lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidservants and to eat and drink and to be drunken the Lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him and at an hour when he's not aware and will cut him in asunder and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers and that servant which knew not his Lord's will prepared not himself neither did according to his Will shall be beaten with many stripes but he that knew not and did commit things worthy of stripes shall be beaten with few stripes foreign to whom sever much is given of him shall much be required and to whom men have committed much of him they will ask them more what a beautiful parable you like that by God's grace Church those are red-letter words how many I can see that my Jesus is asking all of us to watch he's asking all of us to be faithful he's asking us to know the will of God and then do something with it obey the will of God amen now here's some notes I was finding here so loosen means - I'm sorry - grow up the loins means a fast enough the long outer garment always done before travel and work the meaning is to be in readiness of mind Peter said that grew up the loins of your mind and notice they're returning he's returning from the wedding the Union adjusts the curd praise God that's not the parable the servants must be ready because he's returning from the wedding so in all these parables the stories deal with weddings praise God and wedding processions and so we can see how the Union is actually happening and when Jesus comes back here the unions happen he wants to find his people feeding on the meat for their season praise God aren't you glad you have the meat for your season praise the Lord you don't have a father son Holy Ghost baptism or sprinkle praise God you don't have just a justification message although that's wonderful or just of a sanctification message but we have the depth of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost where Christ lives in the believer praise God and he reproduces his life through our lives and he identifies himself in us praise God hallelujah to live the four Word of God amen so we see many requirements Jesus is required you have to stay awake you have to stay awake if you're sleeping he casts you out with the unbelievers into the Tribulation Period if people are sleeping and not awake to the things of God and not watching for Christ to come Oh hallelujah we must not think the Lord is delaying is coming right like the Bible said then we'll get beginning to mistreat one another when we think the Lord is coming but when we think God is going to be here soon we really watch how we treat others praise God because we know these are God's servants these are God's people this is God's food this is God's flock hallelujah this is God's heritage amen it's exactly right and God will bless that servant to whom much is given much is required praise God we know the great message has been given to us so God is requiring us to do something with it hallelujah now I want to bring that out this quote as I was studying this morning and praying and this quote came to my mind and and we all want to be watchful right we all want to stay on track don't we dear brother ma'am gives us some advice about you know over fifty years ago he gave us some advice and I want to read it to you this isn't questions answers on the seals before the the morning before he preaches the Seventh Seal and I mentioned this quote numerous times but I like to read it to you today by God's grace I think you'll be blessed amen but man said now take my advice as your brother don't put your own interpretation to anything you just go on and live a good Christian life cuz you only wind yourself away from the real thing when you do it see you only wind your way again away from the thing and all of you are conscious and know that there's something mysterious happening and it's happening and I know it is he's talking about the seven seals being revealed and later he tells us it's the third Pole it's the opening of the word the mysteries of the book are being revealed praise God then see there's nothing at all that you can do towards salvation or divine healing it's the individuals faith in Christ so brother Graham is making a point I can't make anybody believe for divine healing I can't save anybody it's your own individual faith to receive salvation praise God oh there we go now I want to read that one too it says and I put this in here you know for our sake with preachers because right now one of the great attacks on the bride is oh no more preachers just play tapes which tapes have a place we appreciate tapes but the Prophet never ordained it plus the play tapes he never said that he never said changed things that have all tape playing he never said that he said keep doing the same thing he said we need more preachers they said brother Graham should you be the only one preach and he said of course not we said we need more preachers amen but you know those quotes if you've been here now to bring up faith in Christ there's ministers that's the most important thing of the day is a good god sent preacher and I'm not exalting myself or the fivefold ministry I'm just repeating what God's Word already says praise God I've ever said you know we can't make people believe but to bring up faith God gives us preachers right he said I admire them and their gift is far beyond anything could be done in anything else as a preacher a man who knows how to rightly divide the word of God it's the most wonderful gift in the world is to be a minister the Prophet says I want to make sure I read that now and then don't forget this quote the Prophet said he quotes Paul where he said study it rightly dividing the word of truth there's three months and the scriptures and using God's words there's three things you must not do now let's study these for a few 10 minutes three things you must not do and all out in the land wherever you are across the nation be sure to put these down in your mind if you haven't got a pencil you must do these things we tell you all the time how you must do now I'm gonna tell you what you must not do now you must not misinterpret the word you say well I believe it means this it means just what it says it needs the no interpreter and you must not misplace the word and you must not dislocate the word and if we would do either of those it throws the whole Bible and a confusion and in a chaos if our church finds ourselves in chaos or confusion it's possible myself or some other preacher misinterpreted the Word of God that's a great possibility isn't it that's what the prophet prophet teaches and then he gives examples now here you can understand about this brother Graham said to misinterpret an example of this the Bible the Word says what it means what it says God's one person not three persons he said that's misinterpreting oh I can see three persons and Father Son Holy Ghost well the Bible didn't say that that's misinterpreting the word so anytime that would be done that's misinterpreting scripture saying something the Bible doesn't say misplacing remember I preached all these series in 2016 I got it I got it saved on my computer and it's back there if you want to listen to it but I preached all the way through I'm just reviewing these for you misplace making God in one age and not the same God today that's the problem you misplaced him to a different age or generation because Hebrews 13:8 says he's the same every day and then the Prophet said if you dislocate the word he sits like putting you know elbow to the knee or something like that he gives that example in the sermon he said that's like preaching Moses's message in jesus's day or noah's message in Moses day so we don't want to do those things right this is how we're going to stay on track this is how we're gonna watch and pray this is how we're going to do the work God called us to do to stay with God's Word don't misinterpret it don't misplace it and don't dislocate God's word now I'm getting back to the quote where the prophets talking I told you before don't just try to put any interpretation just believe me as your brother we're living in a great hour we're living at a time where you just be real humble be a Christian and try to live for God and live honest with your fellow man and love those who don't love you this is brother branham's advice while preaching the seven seals don't add your interpretation of the seals don't add anything the Word of God just be real humble praise God and love everybody love even your enemies praise the Lord you see you only make it a mysterious something and mess the real program of God up you see we have the mysteries don't we church where the mysteries revealed but we can't make it seem so mysterious like we're a cult or something like that you can't do that Loran said don't do it like that just tell Pete he's gonna say it next he said just tell people how much you love Jesus all the time don't act mysterious and try to make yourself more spiritual and try to make predictions like other people you know try to that just be real humble just love God love people and you'll be right with God amen he said but if the church you're not supposed to know these things so don't put your interpretation anything you just go ahead and just remember what you're told live a Christian life go to your church be a real light wherever you are and just burn for Christ and tell the people that how you love him and just let your test I want to be with love all the time with the people because if you don't you twist yourself out into something there and then you're off the beaten track how many one stay on the track I don't want to get off the track I don't my train I don't want my family going off God's track I want to stay right on the track I don't want to add anything to it I want my fire to keep burning this is how you do it stay in the love of God so every time you do it you've done that he talks about people and making false doctrines so just don't try to make no interpretation especially tonight when that seal a seventh seal comes up in front of you just don't try interpret it you just go ahead and just be humble and go right on with the same plain message glory now you say brother Animas are we being the Church of them in God shouldn't we he said well I want to say they said why can't I I want to have this he said no remember I'm saying this for your good see I'm saying it so that you understand if you believe me now listen to what I tell you so see people want to jump and try to get revelations and new understandings and don't get me wrong there is place for that but when we misinterpret the Word of God we start getting in trouble that's one of the attributes of having a false doctrine you start acting in a way that's unloving to God right like you said you start acting unloving you start hating people you start attacking people because wherever there's disobedience to God's Word there's always fruits to that there's always crunk fruits right any church that has a false doctrine will end up having some type of sin take over those who believe it it has to because that sin is like a seed and it will be the Bible said it produces death in the end I remember that every false doctrine produces death we know that that's why it's got to be repented of he said don't try to make yourself odd to be a Christian because you take because you take yourself away from God if you can understand it this is that third poll says you should have caught that the other day so we talked about the opening of the seals being the third Pole God revealing his word right God opening the word praise the Lord does that help by God's grace just be a humble God loving God fearing enemy loving Christian praise God we're not to make ourselves try to look you know to be de for now we have to look different because of our standards but we don't make it look like a clan or a clique or a cold or something like that we should tell people how much we love Jesus all the time amen it's back to loving God with all of our hearts now go to second Timothy 2 real quick I just want to show this here right after Paul tells Timothy to rightly divide the word in 2nd Timothy 2:15 verse 16 and 17 or 16 he said but shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more godliness so did you see that everybody catch up if someone is babbling off some vain ideas if someone's babbling or spewing out some false new doctrine it's actually false the Bible said they will increase the what more ungodliness right every tree is known by its fruit when someone preaches false doctrine or teaches this false idea watch their life they're not going to increase in holiness they're gonna increase in ungodliness that's why you should watch my life as your pastor or whatever a ministry comes in here watch our lives our lives need to line up with God's Word hey man it's exactly right if not if they don't line up something is gonna happen you're gonna see more ungodliness what if they're right you're gonna see more godliness that makes me happy glory go to verse 17 and their word will eat as death a canker of whom is high mania sand fleas look at him called the names of the preachers preach and false doctrine he calls them out by name verse 18 who have who concerning the truth have erred saying that the resurrection has passed already and overthrow the faith of some so see here Paul give us an example this is a case of someone not rightly dividing the word they say oh the rapture is over the resurrection is over and Paul says that overthrows people's faith and cause them to live a more ungodly life but when you preach true doctrine and the people are really hungry receiving it their lives will be more godly all the time amen that's the perfect example right there because nevertheless verse 19 the foundation of God stands for having this seal the Lord knows them that are his and let every one that name it the name of Christ depart from iniquity hey man that's how you know your life should be more going more towards godliness and not towards iniquity compromise here well pretty soon you compromise there pretty soon you compromise here pretty soon let this sit and that sit in that center we can't compromise on anything we must obey all the Word of God that's a perfectly Bible example now what about Pete I believe there's danger in saying brother Rams coming back to do a plane or do a horse like Jose and I talk about all the time because Jose came out of that stuff I don't know if you knew that Jose came out of those false doctrines they were saying they were Taizo man brother branham's name down there and uh nicaragua and he said they still do he's trying to get his brothers out of those churches that's where he came from and he told me though a few weeks ago he said jesse when i came to your church he said you were preaching on how the return ministry there's no return ministry he said and it set me free from that so see Church there's reason sometimes preachers will preach on things and I didn't even know it I didn't even know the brother study would struggle with that but for some reason I felt led to preach against the return ministry that day and that brother needed to hear it God knows what he's doing what is it it's God giving the people the meat in due season amen and you and he's told me all the adultery and fornication that took place in all those churches and had these false doctrine he said those preachers with the false doctrine will sneak around he said a couple he knew in particular from those churches that baptize in brother man's name they'll go though from church to church they'll move in there like a man he said of a false preacher will moved to a church he'll act like he's sitting though he's already married he acts like he's singled out the church far away and get another wife and then move on leave that woman there and move on he said he knows many people that do that you see wherever there's false doctrine it's gonna produce ungodliness every corrupt tree every tree that's corrupt is gonna have corrupt fruit you can you see that by God's grace what aren't you glad when you find a tree with good fruit praise God amen aren't you glad when you find clean waters hallelujah you can take a drink of God's pure Word of God oh I'm so happy to have it today he said never make yourself odd to be a Christian he said just stay with the same simple message of God amen I hope you like that by God's grace out of that amen glory let's get back to the judgment section here by God's grace how am i doing on time okay twenty minutes that's pretty good now Jesus says if you're not careful I'll come on you as a thief ancient Sardis was constantly harassed by bandits that swooped down from the hills and pillaged the people thus they knew only too well what the Spirit was saying and that the coming of the Lord is as a thief listen this vigilance and preparation alone will suffice to be ready for us coming now we know that this is the message for the false vine for the coming Lord will be as it was in the days of Noah the eight saved were well aware of the impending flood and being aware we're prepared and saved let me just take a moment on this vigilance of preparation yesterday my family we went to a family's wedding and we walk in the reception we can tell right now it's gonna be a rock-and-roll reception and so we look across the table with the children and I said children if anybody asked you to dance you tell them no thank you cuz I told them we don't dance for the devil we only dance for Christ that's right preparing them I see the atmosphere that you know not all people like to dance but as soon as you walk in that atmosphere I got to prepare the children and I was on guard like a watchdog I felt like I was like like I was watching my turn to make sure they don't start dancing you know because it's really easy to get in the flesh not because I want to punish them but because I want to protect them well the RAM said if a person does get the Holy Ghost what's gonna get him he said rock and roll in church God knows my heart I'm sharing a personal testimony a wonderful brother who who was in the message just came the message you know a few years ago he was so on fire he just called him a few weeks ago I felt little Lord to call and talk to him and he said I got some bitterness a complex in my church against different people and he said the first thing I went back to was rock and roll and he still goes that message church and he's admitting to me these things and look at the perfect example if you don't keep sin out of your heart it's gonna go right to the things of the world because he's angry with people in the church and so what music makes him feel angry rock and roll mix and feel angry right that's what it does either sex or anger right that's what it basically what it is you see so we've got a guard against those things we got a guard we got to be diligent on our toes and so I'm watching my children a whole time with this rock and roll and I go up and talk to the family and I said they say some about dance and I said I said yeah they like to dance I said I was real loud in front these people I make sure I was really loud my wife's shaking her head I made sure I was really loud and I said I said that very word I said we don't dance for the devil we only for Jesus and they go okay okay because I've got to be Bilgin I've got to be prepared I've got to know they're gonna try and then one of my girls come up and said yeah if somebody just asked me to dance and I said no thank you what was that that was God's hand of protection Church hallelujah and somebody asked me about dance I said well if they play the right music I might dance out there but you got to get some Jesus music out there you know see me dance a little bit by God's grace I danced at Bible club I've only danced a couple of times here but I dance wherever there's a worship of Lord I like to dance there praise the Lord but that's just an example you got to be prepared you got to be ready for the battle you got to know the battle you're walking in to praise God and so jesus said if you don't I'm coming like a thief if you're not ready I'll come like a thief because you're not even looking for me he goes on to say but the world of the ungodly was swept away to about Noah's day though they daily were in contact with the righteous and heard the truth they turned to the side until was too late those completely carnal people and that ancient period type out today the nominal Christians whose lives are full of earthly things now let's not let's not make this word make us think outside the message let's just think about anyone anyone okay so the people and Noah's day that were lost type out Christians today any church whose lives are full of earthly things what's our lives full of if I could look at your schedule and your calendar what would it be pull up is it full of earthly things and pleasures of the earth or or he said or is it first a desire for spiritual things because whatever it's full of that's what you're gonna get back whatever you're put you're either preparing for the tribulation or you're preparing for the rapture and you're what you're preparing for one of the other you must be village it watching for Christ to come in fact he comes when they're not expecting him so we got to constantly be expecting the return of the Lord see their lives are full of earthly things and take pleasure in them to such an extent that they have no desire for the spiritual and they're not at all aware of nor ready for his appearing people can come to church in our church any Church and have no desire for spiritual things can you say amen to that you've all seen it people can come to church they're here but they really don't want to be here they really would rather be somewhere else and this is what brother am saying this is I'm coming as a thief you must watch you must prepare you must have your mind right he must be thinking about the coming of the Lord your life must be full of spiritual desires not earthly desires I remember Bram said the secret to being a Christian in the church age book he said the seeker is when trials come he said you increase your service to Christ you don't pull away and give Christ less you give more of Christ you give more to him he said that is the secret to Christianity creasing your service for Christ now the eulogy I looked up eulogy on Google and apparently a eulogy is something you say in remembrance of someone who's passed away so here's what the eulogy is for the church now has a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy of course the word names means people as it says in acts 1:15 concerning those in the upper room the number of names together we're about 120 but to me it goes far beyond just signifying people it brings out the truth that is set forth in every age which was spoken to us by our Lord with great emphasis it is this the church system of these ages is made up of two vines the true and the false God and his own sovereign purpose has put them all together calling them the church see in this age how he's rebuked them saying unto the church which is he said not churches are in Sardis but lumping them together so Jesus loves the true church and the false church together he said the church which is I know that works you are dead he says your works are unfulfilled and then he goes he says on thou this church in sardis has a few people in you that are right and not wrong like the majority doesn't that sound familiar there's a few people that are right in this day there's just a few people that are right in this day that are actually walking worthy of Christ today that's why these churches ages are so important they give us more revelation for our lives few that are actually walking a worthy life we'll get to worthy in just a moment now these people that were the true saints of God were walking all pleasing unto the Lord their garments were clean you see in those days the garments would sweep along the road and pick up dirt and defilement these were watching how they walk so that they were not corrupted by the world they were in the spirit and walking in the spirit they were wholly without blame before him thus they were fulfilling their purpose for that is what Ephesians 1:4 says is the purpose of God for us that we should be holy and without blame before him glory got a few more slides here I'm coming down I got 10 minutes here by God's grace I'm trying to land here I'd say now from this verse which shows the elect of God to be a few names you can see clearly that we have been teaching about this age it was chaotic it was unfulfilled Martin Luther's age was chaotic and unfulfilled it was split scores of ways and God rebuked it almost in its entirety it was weak and sickly and ready to die it was not the glorious area it wasn't the glorious era that carnal minded Protestant historians have tried to make it because there was only a few that were really on fire Martin Luther being the one with the most fire write the message of the age you can't ascend above his revelation he said it's not the glorious area that they made it there was actually very few walking in white and that's according to Jesus now who we gonna take the historians are we gonna take Jesus we got to take Jesus he said there's actually few in this age that actually we're walking worthy of the gospel one quick look at that tree saw was cankered and blighted denuded of leaf and barren of fruit except for some deformed and worming fruit that was fast dropping to the ground but be but hold a moment look closer there at the top the light of the Sun were some first fruits a few names perfect in him for they were born of him fill with him and walking with him by his word thank God for those few thank God for Martin Luther thank God for his wife thank God for those who faithfully filed the Word of God now you remember this picture I showed you this was made by a Rommel able I rely qalaat of his illustrations now there's a Roman Catholic okay Baptist Java witnesses Wesley's okay Methodists okay Wesley's alright so in the days of Luther where's Luther anybody see Luther up there and I'm mr. Luther I missed it I know he lived in the 1500s anyway not sure about the timing on that but the point is at the top after all these moves of God have gone forth there's light at that there's life at the top praise God that's the point I want to make we've got to we've come out of all these things I was raised in Assemblies of God I've come out of there by God's grace amen we're raised in different ones of these dead branches that the bugs have eaten away and you see the bugs that have eaten away the lives of church members where there's no real hunger for God they don't want to walk worthy like yesterday I'll just say it again at the wedding I'm not trying to say anything bad about anybody but church but Lutheran preachers are out there dancing to rap music and Here I am standing like this like what are you doing you're a preacher you know you ought to live higher than that we've got power to live higher than that amen doing electric slides and all kinds of things like that they need an electric slide back into the God's Word I need a slide back into God's Word with electric shock of Revelation amen with a shock proof vest and something like that they need to get shocked amen I got shocked by God's Word how it calls for holiness and it hates the things of the world praise God and real then the real life of Christ will come in a real Justin it's exactly right you see but at the point he's making the point that in Luther's day there was just a few that were actually walking worthy of the gospel because Jesus said a few of you are walking worthy of me and they shall walk with me Jesus says I love these red letter words don't you that's why I mean so much to me because I know it's Christ speaking it's all the Bible's inspired don't even wrong but this is Christ specific red letter words they're so precious that is what God says he will bestow upon them for this upright walk that is part of their inheritance that he's reserved for them hey man if they were willing to walk with him through the toils and snares of life and be an honor to him he was going to reward them he's not forgetful of our labor of love God will always recommence us for our efforts to please him amen that's beautiful so part of Jesus reward for this age was I walk with you if you walk with me I'll walk with you amen I'll certainly walk with you he said yes they had walked through the world and had not part taken of it they not let the world systems overcome them when the illustrious names of that age had yielded to the blandishments of the state and chosen public I'm sorry political mindedness rather than spiritual mindedness and we're on their way back into the world those few stood for the word of God and thereby honor the Lord now he would honor them in return hallelujah for they shall walk with him in white they had identified themselves with him on earth and now he would identify himself with them in the New Jerusalem and how Marvis will be that identification in that beautiful church my you know the hard part is that our honor many times comes later down the road that's our hard tart our part as human beings we don't see the reward right away do it that's why we got to have spiritual eyes of faith so we can see long-term praise God we can see the reward we can look beyond the curtain of time amen or we can do that any time we turn on the fifth seal we can look past the curtain of time hallelujah praise God we've got to have a long-term eagle eye vision to be able to see there is a reward for all those who walk with Christ now praise God well Graham said it makes me rejoice and yet it makes me weep to think of his condescension for you will note that he is look at this I love this Jesus is not dressed in another color different from the Saints as earthly leaders would do so today no they're like him he is like them they are like him even as John said for they see him as he is what a beautiful example think all the world leaders they all look different from everybody else but Jesus looks like everybody else he wants to be identified with one of them the Bible said he's a joint heir with his brethren praise God he's their God but he's also their brother praise God hallelujah and he dresses just like they do amen Oh glory all right just a few more minutes yeah I got four minutes notice Jesus says write letter words for they are worthy they are worthy do you realize who's saying this does everybody realize it is Jesus the worthy one himself this is the only one who is accounted worthy to take the book out of the hand of him who sits upon the throne in Revelation chapter four and five and now this worthy one is saying to his Saints you are worthy here is the one the only one qualified to judge and indeed all judgment is committed unto him and he says you are worthy I wonder if we could say that right if you can say that reveaied when you say I am worthy of Christ's reward hard to say that isn't it because I don't feel I'm worthy like on Wednesday night I'm crying saying God let me do something for your name you know Wednesday night service I just wanna do something for Jesus praise God I feel like many times I don't do anything and I think we all get under guilt you know personal condemnation and things like that but if we do God's work for our life he's gonna say you are worthy remember earlier I said your position might be a farmer he said it might be a housewife he said it might be a preacher a doctor he said whatever your position is he said stay in your position amen and be the best position you can be for God's glory amen hallelujah Jesus calls them worthy and I mean let me say like this you're never gonna hear me say I'm worthy other than just was like we did there but really we want Jesus to be the one to say it Oprah Lois you're so worthy of praise no no sir oh brother Kevin you're so worthy of praise no let us not say let's have Jesus say it praise God but one day church like we said one day we'll stand there and we'll be able to say we are worthy of the reward when our bodies change and every all the things are past there's no more temptation no more lust no more sin no more anything no more pride anything like that we'll be able to say we're worthy by the blood of Christ but remember said these words are as astounding as are the words of Rome Romans 8:33 I'm gonna read out of the King James the way translation says God says I am righteous hmm God says I am righteous Romans 8:33 how many believe that you're righteous in Christ this morning you believe that Romans 8:33 it says who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifies in other words God made me righteous right God says I'm righteous God says I'm going to heaven God says I'm saved God's Word says that I don't care what you say God said it amen I don't care what mom or dad or grandma or friends or anyone it's what God says about me that's what matters and he said you are worthy because you've walked with me praise God he said if you walk with me and I walk with you you walk for me I'll walk with you and then you'll be you'll begin white robes as well by God's grace let me bring this right here I got two minutes one minute they're in the white light of God's righteousness hear the sweet voice of Jesus as he says these are mine they are righteous they are worthy they shall walk with me in white and I didn't have time for this because like I said I only had one minute I went through the whole New Testament unworthy and unworthy scriptures we should recognize our unworthiness like John the Baptist I'm not worthy to loose his sandals we should be like the Roman centurion I'm not worthy that you've come to my house yet Jesus says you've got great faith right the workman Jesus disciples had to be worthy of the meat that they received when they went to preach to the Jews he said don't go to the loss or I'm sure don't go to the Gentiles go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel Matthew chapter 10 Jesus told us who would be worthy of his reward let's read that Matthew 10:32 I got one minute Matthew 10:32 because I think that's what we're gonna leave here thinking about well brother brother Jesse preached that Jesus is going to call me worthy how do I know I'm worthy well let me show you some scriptures here it's along the same lines of obedience and everything like that of course but let's see exactly what Jesus Christ said in Matthew 10:32 our Lord amen 10:32 whosoever therefore shall confess me before men him will I confess also before my father which is in heaven I had a great a great time doing that yesterday before all those dancers and drinkers I had a great time saying Jesus Christ right in front of them I love that verse 33 but whosoever shall deny me before men him will I also deny before my father which is in heaven think not that I'm come to send peace on the earth I am come not to send peace but a sword for I'm come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother in the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law and a man's foes should be they of his own household he that loveth father or mother more than me is not what worthy here's how you know if you're worthy another way if you love your family more than you love Christ you're not worthy in other words he's got to be your first love he has to be number one very familiar but let's ties him perfectly with what he says you are worthy who are the worthy ones those who love Christ above their families and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me you have to love Christ more than your children now that doesn't mean you'd ever deprive them of anything when they grow up and they disagree with the gospel or any that ever happens we got a love Christ more than we love children verse 38 and he that taketh not his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me that's where we gotta find our that's where we got to find our ministry what's our ministry what's our cross what's your cross what's my cross what cross are we dragging along on the journey of life praise God what is that heavy weight burden you feel like I just can't get this weight off my heart I got to keep preaching I got to keep doing everything I can I got to take more things on I just got to do something I got to get somebody to Christ what great cross or burden are we draggin let's have something on our hearts amen we have to have a cross like we said for the housewife it's the Train the mother right that's a great or great training the children that's a great burden for the farmer you know he's got to provide food and all these things that burdens the cross verse 39 he that find us his life shall lose it he that loses his life for my sake shall find it he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me he that receiveth the prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a Prophet's reward glory and he that receiveth the righteous man the name of righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of the disciple verily I say unto you he shall know were wise lose his reward here are two clear clear ways you know you're worthy of Christ he's made you worthy right you love Christ more than everyone in your family no matter what anybody says he's and you won't deny him before any man or woman and second you have a cross you have a burden that you carry daily you're following you're constantly following Christ with this heavy burden you're dragging along your journey of life it's not easy but you have a God called cross to carry it that's how you know you're worthy of Christ and that's not my words I didn't misplace the word brother Adam I didn't this locate it right I didn't misplace it I didn't misinterpret it that's exactly what Christ said let's stand to our feet the next one what makes somebody unworthy of the wedding they say oh I can't come to the wedding I've got merchandise I've got farms I've got families that makes you unworthy of the rapture the Bible says I mean we could go I could this is a whole nother message I got one two three four five I got all kinds of more slides all kinds of scriptures unworthy how many want to be worthy though the way we're worthy is Christ with Jesus we'll look at us church our faith you all want to be there look at all of us who are faithful no say you I'm walking with you because not because on earth you walk for me you kept your garments unspotted from the world you were constantly watching even late nights even in hard hours even times where it's very hard to watch you stayed awake spiritually you kept looking at with you kept holding your little candle burning your candle looking out the window I wonder I hear Christ coming is Christ coming soon I hear the horses coming of Christ a great audit tirage we kept looking we kept watching we kept being prepared we kept our lives pure unspotted from the world how many Father Lord your word says pure religion is to visit the widows and their children in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world when I thank you for those Lord and we could boil down Lord many of our motivations this morning I wonder if that be our main motivation dear God all I want is to be pure from sin all I want is to be free from the stains of this world how many raise your hands say brother Jesse that's my design I want to be free from the stains the word I want pure religion in my life North appeared on Wednesday night I just want to do something for you Lord not I want to preach your word I want to be faithful with the influence you've given to the Lord God I wanna be faithful with nor the groups that you placed me with your God especially the church but also now the school Lord is there's a little group there dear God and now go in the middle school I want to be faithful I don't want to get drunk in spiritually as Jesus's parable said and start beating and mistreating the people but your promise that we don't want to pull any punches if we know their sin we don't want to Barney punches and let sin grow as leaven in the church we're in our school group Lord God we want to hear you say your word Lord is that we said I try to get the people to imagine themselves saying it it's so hard to say I'm worthy of Christ's reward it's so hard to say because we often fall short remind us of how quickly you forgive dear God remind us of how gracious you are bring these things to our remembrance truly in Luther's day you had a few that walked before you and white and the Lord you have a few today Lord God that are walking before you right they're walking with you they're following you they have a cross they have a burden they have a ministry it's heavy at times it's hard to pull it sometimes as long as we keep our eyes up on the one who's in front of us one of her following you Lord God you said you'll make up burden light will transform our minds Lord will simply see that our affliction was light affliction for God and it's unworthy to be compared to the glory which will come here after Lord the sufferings we have now are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to come for the privilege or [Music] night yesterday as I drove all my count of such a privilege I get the stand there against rock and roll and rap I just counted a privilege I get to stand there against that can call out against the Lord God thank you I'll stand with you I'll never deny your lord help me to never deny you lord help us each one of us Lord God do not deny you before men and help us to walk with our cross that might be worthy of this vocation where'd which we're talking these are red letter words Lord I have not added to your word this morning these are just your pure beautiful words to whom much is given this message much is required I remember my mother told me that many times and I tried to walk worthy of that Lord even in high school I do have things other people did Lord God I try to keep a pure Peter knows Lord it might be said Lord how much greater that Lord God or would not publicize our own us necessarily but heavens eyes are all parts of your God the Bible said there's a cloud of witnesses Oh glory there's angels that are witnessing Lord God our lives no God nor most of all you're watching their choices you're watching when you're looking for someone Lord who's walking worthy that will keep their garments white Lord if any of us the Lord have on shore or maybe spear see take the beach of the blood and just feed off our garments right now
