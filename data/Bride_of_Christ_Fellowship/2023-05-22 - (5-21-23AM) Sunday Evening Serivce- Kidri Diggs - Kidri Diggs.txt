Romans chapter 4 verse 16. the Bible says therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end of the promise that to the end of the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of faith of Abraham who is the father of us all as it is written I have made thee a father of Nations before him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and call it those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's room womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform amen may the Lord blessed reading of his word you can have your seats amen praise God my subject by the grace of God is faith without reasoning faith without reasoning but my my my subtitle or subject tonight is no reason to doubt faith without reasoning no reason to doubt amen you know we we are creatures of Faith amen God has called us to walk by faith you know this whole this whole journey is an unseen Journey so we're walking in in areas we're walking you know by just believing in God Amen you know you know um I had a question one time I was I was asking to God and I was like Lord I sure would and I know all of us may have done this it's like Lord I sure would like to see my life I would like to know what to do where to go and and everything just have it all together you know we believe our journey is heaven amen but just what about what if you just knew the next step in the step after that and the step after that you know wouldn't that be glorious you know that that would be so sweet amen but you know what God doesn't work like that because if we had it all mapped out and everything put in order you know there'd be no reason to Faith there'd be no reason for Faith so what God does he doesn't give us the plan for our our whole journey our whole life he may show you the next step Hallelujah but he won't show you step out of step out of step out of Step all at once amen what do you do if you give us a little bit and do you cause us to pray Hallelujah did you give us a little bit more and he'll cause us to pray Hallelujah why what is it why is there such a walk of Faith because that's how God Keeps Us close Hallelujah because if you didn't have the element of Faith or or or having to prove God Amen your journey would be all on you all in your hands but because we're believing and we're walking by faith and we're walking according to the Unseen we have to rely on God but you know it's too often that when it comes to Faith that doubt is acquainted by it yes but if I can tonight if I ask each and every one of us who are truly redeemed and truly serving God what reason do you have to doubt God [Applause] if we really think about it has God ever failed us if we would just take the Bible and go in the Bible and pull out Believer by Believer by believer and look according to the scriptures we wouldn't even have a reason to doubt because God has never failed [Applause] he has never failed he has never come up short so church we doubt god without even having a real reason to doubt God so what is our doubt our doubt is based upon reasoning amen amen hallelujah and the prophet of God said in wisdom versus faith that reasoning always tries to find a better way believe me I ask you something if God lays something out and he says okay I need you to do thus thus thus and thus that is the perfect way but because our flesh keeps up against it we try to find it easy around and you know sometimes easier is not always better [Applause] so sometimes we have to fight for the promises sometimes we have to come against trials and tribulations and all these things just so God can show us who we are show us who we believe in God loves to take away our doubts Hallelujah he loves to strip away all of our reasoning [Applause] hey you know church this this message tonight is is real to me amen because you know just living by faith and and and not having real real sources of finances and all these things I have to be able to look back at my testimony and say God you've always provided [Music] [Applause] so why am I doubting this situation when you've always provided you you your name has remained to be Jehovah Jireh so what makes this situation any different he's always been Jehovah Rapha he's always been a Healer so what makes this situation any different [Music] what what are we what are the basis of our doubt reasoning reasoning reasoning is the basis of our doubts but when we when we when we look at reasoning and we think about uh just just you know God in himself and how great he is hallelujah we shouldn't even put reasoning in the same category with God [Applause] oh my God reasoning let's look at the word for a second reasoning Hallelujah is such as a host it's hostile to God reasoning is the thing that fights your faith reason is the thing that Hallelujah challenges your faith so we should never reason when it comes to the word of God Hallelujah it deals with your conscience and conceit and here it is again reasoning deals with what your imagination hey yeah [Applause] you get a pain you get something going in your body and God says you're healed but then that pain causes you to reason because you can feel it that does not change the promise the promise stays the same and see if you could kick out your reasoning your reasoning Hallelujah will if you can kick out your reasoning you have no reason to doubt [Applause] Hallelujah get rid of your reasoning and your doubt will leave right along with it Hallelujah because the Republic of God said there's two elements we can live by it's either Faith or doubt if I can get rid of your doubt tonight we'll see Supernatural things take place in this building Hallelujah he said we can get everybody on the same Accord Hallelujah he said there'll be no one walking out seek in the next five minutes [Applause] that's why he came to a prophet and he told the prophet if you could get the people to believe all things would be possible so what did God do God gave him gifts undeniable gifts that will operate in the presence of the people why distribute with their doubts hey man so there'd be no reasoning there'd be no way if you could even doubt God because of what God is doing amen now if you just take your life your assembly your church and think about all the things that God has done why should we leave out of here doubting and I'll tell you right now while I'm preaching if you think about your situation and you say but but is the first substance of reasoning yeah [Music] as soon as you say but reasoning and doubt begins to kick in because of God you think what God Said let there be there was no but in that whatever he said it came to pass he said let there be the sun let there be the move Let It Be affirmative between the heavens and the Earth all the things that God said there was no but even found whatever he said came to pass just like he said amen that's why it's very important for us hallelujah not to try to interpret the word let's just believe the word [Applause] Hallelujah but the thing I love about uh uh right here in the in the in the book of uh numbers if we go back to Numbers Chapter 13. I ain't gonna be long tonight y'all know I'm about to close Numbers Chapter 13. now we know before the children of Israel got here they they the only the only reason they were here is because they were seeking out a promise they were singing out the promise of a land that was filled with Milk and Honey Hallelujah a land that God promised 400 plus years ago other but now they're on the journey they're out of Egypt and they're coming Hallelujah they're walking towards that promise amen but they have people with them that don't believe the same thing you have to be careful who you fellowship with because the Bible says evil Communications corrupt good matters and if that person if you're not able Hallelujah to witness to that person and your beliefs overcome their beliefs you'll begin to believe what they believe and they'll even get you to start doubting her look at your salvation amen like I said uh one of my friends I work out with and and and and and and and I never knew she believed like this until we started talking about the Lord one day so we started talking about the Lord and you know uh uh uh all my friends that call me Reb at the gym so we were talking uh about God and and she she began to express to me that uh I don't believe uh God like you do but I believe in God and I'm thinking the way I believe is the only way Hallelujah so I'm already looking at her like she I ain't gonna say crazy but I'm already looking at her like what's she gonna say because what I believe Hallelujah has been proven amen [Applause] amen what I believe has has produced we gonna get to it what I believe has produced real clusters of greats well I believe I have evidence to walk back and say hey because I believed in this I got proof amen that's why I can stand where I'm standing Hallelujah because I have proof I have evidence Hallelujah of what God is saying you know what she was saying that Christianity is not even the real religion it's just come around or 2 000 years ago I said see that's where you're wrong yeah I said see you don't know your Bible you're basting Christianity on AD and BC like before Christ and A.D and all this stuff I say look the one who said let there be was Jesus [Applause] let's do this the one that said let there be light was Jesus Christ see you're basing us upon what historians and all these things we say but let me show you something let me take you up to the book of Acts remember God is identified by a pillar fire or pillar of light now you go over them to acts amen God knocks Paul of his horse and Hallelujah that same pill of fire that led the Chisel of Israel it wasn't a man Hallelujah it wasn't a man of The Voice he's a voice leading to people and they called him what Jehovah what do they call him the Mighty God God Almighty Hallelujah but when Paul said Lord who are there he said I am Jesus so you want to give me a gospel that was only here in 2000 years and I'll give you a gospel that was here from the beginning that's what I put my faith on Hallelujah see people don't know their Bible bad and you know what clearly you know we started talking some more and different things and and she was saying I'm not saying what you believe is wrong I just don't believe it the way you believe it and then she starts to say you know uh well how do you know God wasn't a woman I say because the Bible says his name was Emmanuel hallelujah amen the Bible says and he shall come hallelujah amen and then the Bible says the shoulders shall be the government shall be upon his shoulders Hallelujah so if we we do like that Community every pronoun recognized that God was a man [Applause] see the problem is people want religion without an absolute they want a religion that they can fit into their own lives to believe and make it an issue of cardinality like black and white and race and female and male and all these things no we don't deal with none of that hallelujah we're not worried about what color God is that's that's the silliest argument ever what color God is I'll tell you what color he is if God is in me he's a black man if God is in you he's a white man regardless of you he's anxious that's what color he is [Applause] because I'll show you the mystery the mysterious what Christ in you the hope of glory [Applause] think about it Church in their old theology that old gospel they preach they make God a racist [Music] that's ridiculous God is only this group and only that group and only that how could he be Sovereign and he's still segregating the people their own argument is silly so anyway we me and her kept talking you know and we we didn't really get to a purpose of our conversation it just kind of let me know that there's so many other strange beliefs out there so I so I I say you do believe in God she said yes so I'm trying to give to the place of Jesus Christ so I say well who do you pray to if you don't believe in Jesus Christ she said I pray to myself and I did like y'all did just now huh [Music] I'm sick old Cadre of Heaven please heal yourself it don't even make any sense see that's why the prophet preached that message wisdom versus faith and he also said that he hides it from the wise and prudent Hallelujah these people are so wise they got so much intellect and and they're breaking seeds and all these things and they kept believing the Simplicity of God Hallelujah and if you can't believe in the Simplicity of God always trying to break things down to another layer only thing you're doing is producing doubt amen amen that's all the scientists are doing they're producing doubts Hallelujah I had a conversation with an atheist amen and he begins to tell me that God uh uh That Never Was a God who began to create everything it came from a big bang so I began to ask him where the big bang came from and he says well everything has to be proven because first he began to tell me that I wasn't divinely healed and I was like beg your pardon yeah because now you want to fight now you want to fight when you want to tell me my experience of Faith doesn't exist I don't care what kind of giant is in your land they can never take the experience of faith and you know he began to say well I don't believe I don't believe you were divinely healed show me the paperwork show me where the daughters had X-rays and all these things this and that and I said you know what that's fine I said but check this out I say you see this scar this is not me losing my hair this is where they put a shunt in me I said you see this right here this is where I had 27 Staples in my head I said you know what sir I don't need no paperwork I am the paperwork Hallelujah I am the paperwork you are the paperwork who are the paperwork you all the experience of faith that God is dealt with on this Earth Hallelujah I don't got to go to the hospital Hallelujah why am I going he said bye Stripes I'm Healed [Applause] I don't need no paperwork to prove my God is alive all I got to do is keep living amen amen teachers God is calling in our time for faith without any reasoning and you know even continue talking to that young man he began to say well uh you need evidence you need to prove it and after I told him I said I am the evidence well I said I say well you tell me how do you know that there was a big bang he said well five million years ago signs I said ho ho ho oh don't give me that five million years ago stuff he said I'm trying to tell you how the big bang happened he said five million years ago saying I said stop amen stop telling me about five million years ago in scientists I want you to tell me your experience with the big bang [Applause] how do you know it exists when you can only take the word of a man and the word of a man who was not there [Music] I was glad when he took away all the sins of the world I was in his body thrown across with him I was there Hallelujah he begins to say well science I say no no no you can't give me what scientists say were you there he says no I wasn't there I said well how do you know it's true if you wasn't there you're taking the word of a man Hallelujah I said what I'm telling you I've experienced myself because the things I used to do I don't do anymore the places I used to go I don't know anymore the things I used to believe in don't have authority in my mind anymore why is that Hallelujah because Jesus that stepped in my body and what did he do he Stripped Away all my doubts and furthermore you may be right there was a big bang but that big bank said let there be and it was [Applause] so we went on and on to me him talking just like me and her talking and I came to the conclusion that without a revelation you'll live something that's false and think it's true with no evidence hallelujah what good is a gospel with no evidence Hallelujah let me tell you something if you're in this message and God has never confirmed it to you personally you're just religious [Applause] but the things that happened in the prophet's Ministry happens in your life then you've got some substance see I'm like Paul Hallelujah I wasn't there holy when he preached marriage in the voice I wasn't there when he went to Sunset mouth I wasn't there Sabino Canyon none of these things Hallelujah but just like him I believe in that same God and he's giving me that same Revelation Hallelujah and he told Paul blessed is he who believe in have not seen Hallelujah because when we match up we're going to be believing in the same thing but you be careful who you listen to and what they say and they'll try to disprove you know how they can disprove what you believe in if you don't have an experience amen amen that's the only way they can disprove what you believe that is if you've never had an experience in what you're confessing [Music] but how far can a real experience take you it'll take you to the next battle a real experience will take you to the next battle and then after that battle it'll take you to another experience and do another experience and to another experience hurry see it's a walk of faith Hallelujah David did not defeat Galatians Hallelujah by his own strength he defeated Goliath by his experience with faith a walk with no reason now according to science a man with his bare hands is not able to kill a bear science will tell you that amen amen they're too strong they're too massive scared to think all the stuff bones in the neck too strong all that however David killed it they'll say it's not possible that's what scientists say Google Google say that too and it'll also say that lion being the strongest powerful pound at its size there's no way that a that a a 17 18 year old man can kill a full-grown lion I I wish I had time to put it up on the stream but I've been to Africa and I've seen those nine foot lions and just when they're playing in that ah they make you want to look for some safety because of the makeup and you know it's it's it's it's according to man's Wisdom and knowledge a man is not able to kill a lion with his bare hands amen but let me tell you something it happened happened in Hallelujah no way just as the Red Sea opened David killed the lion in The Band just as Noah escaped the tribulation of the heart Holly David killed a lion in the bed just like Hallelujah me confessing that God is my savior it's the same faith that God has given today Hallelujah the faith that it took for him to kill that lion and that bear was the same faith it took to destroy Goliath because when he came to Goliath he came without any reasoning amen Holy Faith without reasoning amen so he looks like he looks he he is Goliath saying bring me a man and y'all heard me say this before he wasn't saying bring me a man I want somebody to fight he was like bring me a man trying to intimidate try to bring for fear and a little bit of doubt [Music] but in the in the heart of battle David was built in such a way where he would have no fear [Music] [Applause] see that's where Goliath Hallelujah made his mistake David was never afraid in battle he was built that way just like some of us some people are afraid of spiders some people are not some people are afraid of snakes some people are not Hallelujah you're built a certain way and David was built without a fear of War but Goliath didn't understand that he didn't understand he was coming against a man who didn't know what it means to reason in battle [Music] David's mindset was I'ma win and if I don't win nobody ain't gonna win [Applause] notice you go back and look at David Harley anytime there was a battle David said if you don't do it my way my God's way you got to die David didn't compromise remember remember he he was going down to neighbor and different things he told the neighbors hey give me and my men some food and they were like I don't know who you are I ain't giving you nothing and David said I'm gonna kill you your cousins your brothers your in-laws your mama your daddy oh your animal I'mma kill everything you don't deny Hallelujah my God you don't deny the people of God Amen David me business when it came to Hallelujah what is God asked him to do enable not knowing what was going on Abigail was there Hallelujah and she was a woman Hallelujah without any reasoning she knew that David was come to destroy everything so she had to operate in faith and she began to get her hands made get the food you gotta get everything and she came to meet David Hallelujah and what does she do she presented a meal offering today and it was that meal from Abigail that saved everybody's life a woman who didn't operate in doubt but she knew who David was Hallelujah and she came and she spared the whole country Holly she spared neighbor's whole house hallelujah amen so you need so Church what you need is you need a journey where you're walking by faith and no reasoning and no doubt and now you look church I I'ma finish up with this you look how David he comes out took a lion and he says who is this uncircumcised feelings see no doubt operating in faith who is this now remember I believe the Bible said he was nine foot he was a big boy he was totally in Shaquille O'Neal he was told in LeBron James he was a real giant Hood and you know Hallelujah David looked at him and David was like hallelujah look at David's mannerism he didn't have any fear of Doubt David looked at that giant and David said hey hey hey hey my guy what's the reward if I kill it tell me what y'all gonna give me when I kill it what's the reward and you look and you read it David didn't stop asking questions until he got in front of Goliath should him to get in front of a Goliath face [Applause] to your faith will put you in position for victory it may look like a stone battle but if you operate in faith God is putting you in position for victory when everybody else was afraid when everybody else was afraid to stand in front of your life God called David Hallelujah to come out there and stand in the place of Victory when everybody else was doubting and everybody else had fear when everybody else even saw Hallelujah who was almost the same size as Goliath the Bible says he was Head and Shoulders above everyone [Music] but what do you have doubt Hey listen to stay away from them church people who telling you you can't operate in the word of God and when the prophet preached was back for the 60s notice for right now church that's the spirit of Saul Hallelujah somebody who's had an experience with God but doesn't believe it he's had experience with God and now he comes to David and he's trying to get David to operate in something that David doesn't even have in him which is fear which is reasonable which is doubt and they and Saul says to David now David you're only a youth he says and he's been fighting and conquering and doing all these things when he was a youth since he's been a youth he's been destroying Nations and countries and all why are you going to pump up the enemy like that [Applause] let me give you a word of wisdom when challenges come upon your life don't be so quick to say this is the devil because just that confession alone what are you doing you're giving the devil control of that situation when I go through things I don't never say this is the devil or the devil did this or the devil did that no oh my my word tells me that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by God Hallelujah so even when it looked like it's a battle I may not be able to overcome or something goes a little bit wrong in my mind I'm still not going to say man the devil did this no thank you Lord God I don't know what you're doing Hallelujah but open my eyes that I may see you earlier because when you say the devil did the devil did that you're giving the double control and I refuse to give him control [Music] because if he has control over your life he can dictate to the next step and I refuse to give him that kind of power so even when things don't work out the way I think it ought to I say God I thank you that's why job could look at everything Hallelujah and still have no doubt that God was in control [Applause] Church he's losing everything he's getting sick he's lost all his status all his social status they sat down his Facebook account [Music] and Joseph the Lord God give it and the Lord God taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord he's coming to church Covenant Church got boiled all over me sick all this every day Joe his wife comes to say Joe how long are you going to continue to believe and Joe says to her honey do you expect to receive good at the hands of the Lord and no evil blessed be the name of the Lord what do you do in your moment of trial Hallelujah God wants us to believe without any reason amen you know that's why the story of the super tip and the Caribou is is so powerful amen because nothing was there and and the man that's walking with the prophet after he after he didn't already shot the Caribou now he's got evidence of part of the dream and right Hallelujah he's he's easy yes he has if we want to say he has grapes Hallelujah and now he's coming back down the mountain and and the man he's talking to he says so you mean to tell me by the time we get here and where those bushes are a civil tooth is going to appear he says you better believe it he says well I can see clear that and he said I believe I forget his name but he says you sound like you doubting he says oh no he says I remember time or does my brother was sick or somebody was seeking you prayed and it was healed and they've been healed to this day he said so if God told you it got to happen he said amen so they started walking and going now he's and the man starts saying man we're getting real close to use doubt he was walking oh listen to this church listen to this he was a part of a vision but he couldn't see himself as part of that vision and the thing about a vision it has to come to pass holy if it's of God hallelujah that Vision will become prophecy and it will become a manifestation Hallelujah a real manifestation and look so many times people are part of something Supernatural and don't even realize it because of their mindset honey I was talking to brother Eddie about the same thing earlier brother Ed this about the same vision and everything I was asking him I said hey when y'all was on the mountain and the prophet told y'all that he was gonna get a civil tip and a caribou and all these things I said what was y'all doing was y'all looking for it he was like no he said we'll just young men happy to be out there hunting she was a part of a vision and didn't even know it he even denied his place in division [Music] he said somebody here got a green checkered shirt brother Ed look at that brother musical brother brother brother brother bisco looked at brother brother and say not me and after he shot the Silver Tip Hallelujah he says Eddie you got on the green check his shirt [Applause] see you can be a part of a vision and don't even realize the church let's get connected because everything God has for me amen I want to know what I'm doing [Applause] I don't want any doubt or any fear to get in the way and David Hallelujah faith without reasoning Goliath was bigger he was Stronger he was taller his reputation was longer but what he failed to realize he was coming up against a man without any fear he was coming up against a man who believed in his God but what makes David like us David was a man with a testimony amen of what God has already done amen amen hallelujah church I'm gonna give you I'm gonna give you a real punch for the devil tonight you know how you defeat the Devil look back in your life and say God you've already did this so I know you can do this Hallelujah prove your God to yourself Hallelujah Lord if you healed me before I know you can heal me again Lord if you provided before I know you can provide again certainly let real things come out of your mouth and David Gets before Saul and David says Hey Saul this uncircumcised Philistine is going to be just like that lying in that bed and it's all be careful who you're talking to because they'll try to place they doubt on you and then Saul says okay well let me dress you up let me give you something to fight with let me put you in all my armor let me put you in the things that I would wear if I would go out there and David put it all on and David said no this don't just don't fit me right just don't quite fit my fate right this right here got a little fear in it this way here this way he got a little reason in it Church like I used to say doing a pandemic I used to go to People's Church and everybody be sitting in there with a mask on and I say you think that mass is protecting you the only thing protecting us is the grace of God [Applause] and you know you had people who were real radical with this I really need this covert is real and all these things and this and that and then you know where they tell me that I I go I go to extra mile as a city with a big old man song looking like Darth Vader I said but that ain't gonna stop you from getting sick if you're meant to get sick [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah the only thing that's going to stop it is the blood of Jesus Hallelujah amen and you look at it right now what's happening the world is going on we we will say we got covert behind us why why is it behind us because the fear is gone amen fear is gone but if you bring you let an outbreaker some people start getting sick again that fear come right back around what is it it produces doubt or walk with reasoning but David didn't have a walk with reasoning now he gets out there in front of Goliath and Goliath say y'all seen a mirror boy out here do y'all know who I am I'm gonna put him on my spirit I'm gonna feed him to the birds and David said you come to me with a spear and brass and all these things and I come to you in the name of the Lord God of Israel and this day I'm gonna cut your head off real Faith earlier a real experience Hallelujah just like I'll read about Abraham he staggered not he didn't stagger at the promise but he spoke those things Hallelujah that were not as though they were David is speaking of cutting Goliath head off Hallelujah without even possessing a sword [Applause] what was that that was the faith of Abraham she real faith will produce what you need in that moment because Abraham Hallelujah church we always have to take it back to the scripture because Abraham holding him and Isaac on the mountain they have the altar they have the wood and he says where where where where is the sacrifice though and Abraham says the Lord God shall provide himself a sacrifice and the next thing you know a ram is over there going who didn't realize what was it it was a gold Hallelujah so what does it say that Jesus Christ is the greatest of all time [Applause] Jehovah is my goal [Applause] Hallelujah not LeBron not Jordan not Kobe Jesus is the greatest of all time because he can appear right when you need him [Applause] a friend of mine everybody all right a friend of mine in Arizona was hunting he was hunting deer Hallelujah see faith without reasoning he was hunting deer and he had to scope on a bunch of those and he said it was a tree right there he says he says man he's looking through the scope he says all those books he says all those does but no buck he says I want a buck I don't want no door so he's looking he's looking at all the all the uh uh those are walking around the tree and all these things and going from this side to that side you know and he sees this tree and he sees all these those about form walking around he says you know what I want a book he said I ain't gonna leave here till I get a book so he puts his he puts his gun in scope out there he stands up you know as soon as you stand up they start running yeah he said he stands up and he says Hey buck he says and as soon as he say that a book comes from behind the tree Church there was no bug there but his desire to speak to what he wanted created [Applause] Church it had aunt Leslie was big it was everything now you tell me there had to be a mighty big tree to hide a book [Music] but I'm telling this testimony to tell you you can speak what you have need of and it will come to life Hallelujah just like it did for him he said hey buck he said as soon as he said it the book came from behind the tree Hallelujah he caught the gun put it on the book pow it wasn't a vision it was real Hallelujah and I almost got some of that meat but I had to leave quick Church what I'm saying is there's a real faith with no reasoning and that's what God calls us to be that's why I came here to the children of Israel God told them a land flowing milk and honey now we know the story I challenge you to go back and read number 13. the place where we read it it's dealing with where they they go into the land they see the vine of grapes they cut it down they eat the grapes but notice they also said that the sons of anak were there so Church they get the grave they experience Hallelujah the promise in the Land of the Giants amen why were the grape so big because Giants was eating them see God don't give you some ordinary we not just some ordinary blessed people hallelujah amen we have the blessings of giants in church look they give the grapes Hallelujah and the evidence of the promise of the land flowing milk and honey and then the Bible says after 40 days of being in that land they go back they missed the terminology of God hallelujah see they were already there for 40 days that mean they survived the temptation [Music] that means they've survived the persecution 40 means Temptation or persecution Hallelujah and they were already in the land for 40 days with the Giants [Applause] but then reasoning comes in from those same unbelievers who were there experiencing it and they come back and says oh yeah here Moses here's the evidence here's here Joshua here's the evidence the land is truly flowing like God said but there are giants in the land you know what Joshua and Caleb says they so what Hallelujah we don't care let's go take the land at once Hallelujah Church what they should have said was we was already there for 40 days and nobody bothered us [Applause] Church we're already in the Promised Land the only Power the devil got is what you give him you make him strong they were already in the Land of the Giants they already walked out with the Giant's food [Music] so where did that doubt come from it came from those who really didn't believe in the first place [Applause] because you think about it God give you the prophet of God said he said God gave them the evidence of the Lamb being true let's read it let's read it he said so this is in the message confirmation and evidence he said so I'm about to close don't get nervous he said so they come up out of Egypt and they came to a place called Cadence Barney and I believe it was alone there that Joshua a great warrior among them went over to spot the land he crossed joy we know Jordan means death Hallelujah he crossed he calls he crossed Jordan and went over to the other land and came back with the evidence that the land was good she's coming back with the evidence that the land of good if you've got evidence there should be no doubt if you've got evidence there should be no reasoning I'm gonna show you I'm gonna show you what real faith is that doubt and doubt will never be able to touch commission stand up turn around turn around is that your dad I know I don't know about that I don't know about that can you prove it ah I don't think that's your dad that's your dad it's it's it's it's it's it's something that you live by it's something that's a part of you nobody no matter what you go through nobody can tell you any different there's no doubt there's no reasoning let's let's just say he go out of town for a week is he still your dad yeah let's just say if you get a little sick in his body is he still your dad let's just say he becomes a millionaire Hallelujah is he still your dad and if he because of me there he's not only your dad but he's your dad Hallelujah and your dad and your dad Omar and your husband amen but none of that Hallelujah all those things that may be added to him could never change what you started with the basis of what you believe before either that ever came in his life he was always what [Applause] Church no matter where we go no matter what happens whatever trial we go through none of that will be able to change who Christ is to us [Applause] [Music] so whether there's Giants in the land that still didn't change the promise [Music] let me finish he crossed Jordan went over to the other land and came back with the evidence of the land was that the land was good that's God's word was made perfect he promised his promise was true and he had the evidence the confirmation that the land was there Those Grapes was a confirmation you know what church I'm gonna go on and put it out there on the limb y'all know what I am a confirmation you are a confirmation you are a confirmation you are confirmation Hallelujah amen what is that the Holy Ghost is unto you and up to your children and unto those who are far off you uh come for me you are a confirmation of the promise [Applause] from the evidence what is that God is a redeemer I'm the evidence that God is a savior I'm the evidence that God Is A Healer I'm the evidence that God is going to live around [Applause] without the evidence that God is faithful I don't care how many Giants out there in the world God has already shown himself to be true amen Church let's continue to walk by faith without reasoning and the evidence is that we have in our life is the proof that God exists let's just keep walking and believing amen yeah it gets tough sometimes but that's what made God so good Hallelujah think about it Church when we get to heaven Hallelujah you know those who are going to really Rejoice those that have been through something amen yeah honey you know all these these deep teachers and theologians in the message they want to take worship out the church they want us to be an innocent I love you you are so good to me yeah Lord I love you you also good to me but I want everybody else [Applause] holy all over me fill them in my hands fill them in my feet he's all over me the prophet of God said Hallelujah he said when the presence of God comes it brings an emotion amen amen and the only way you can have an emotion is only if you are alive think about it church when we get to heaven I want you to understand this when we get to heaven you ain't gonna be able to control yourself you think you think you're gonna you think you're gonna be able to sit there and say know the words to that I'm not I don't know I'm no not today I got too much going on you think you're gonna be able to do that in heaven no ain't gonna be no control switch [Music] the Bible say in that day every knee shall buy every tongue shall confess that he is Lord and I say this all the time but think about it Church Hallelujah when we get to heaven and start to testify on what we came through amen the prophet of God he said why didn't Miriam dance he said because she looked back and she saw all her problems being drowned in the seat she's on all her trials oh tribulation all her enemies Hallelujah and she started to dance she started to praise the Lord she's starting to worship and Hallelujah hey and you know what I believe I believe when I get there I will be doing some dances that it turns people won't let me do down here hey Hallelujah he's the king of kings and Lord of lords but think about it let's just think about it what kind of spirit is that that's trying to stop the rejoicing in church think about it right why would you want to stop the rejoicing in the sanctuary well we're supposed to be worshiping the object of worship [Music] [Applause] some some just ain't right about that to me why would you want to uh the Bible says clap your hands why would you not want me to cut my hands the Bible says play all the instruments sing the song Hallelujah why would you not want me to do that unless there's the wrong Spirit there yes [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah think about it God loved to be worshiped so much he created angels He said it's the only thing I want you to do [Music] I don't want you to pray I don't want you to preach All I Want You To Do Is Sing all I want you to do is worship if God didn't love it why would he create beings just to worship Him honey and then we come along Hallelujah not only are we worshiping but we're worshiping by revelation we're worshiping on the basis of redemption we're worshiping based upon what we came through hallelujah what God has did for us this is not worship of angels this is worship of redemption Hallelujah Jersey I I I I can see the different ones written songs and going on to be with the Lord you think about a church but we get to heaven uh let's just say we hook up with sister Brenda Lewis woke up with her and say sister brother remember you wrote that song is going to take a stronger win harder than this to keep me from my promises and she says brother Diggs you know when the lord gave me that song true story when the lord gave me that song There was a hurricane out on the water the winds were 150 miles per hour blowing my house beating the trees and then inspiration started to fall hallelujah what was God doing God was getting rid of her doubt [Applause] you get rid of your doubt probably the wind's starting to blow in Hallelujah and God made a song out of that [Applause] [Music] something that looked like it should have destroyed became a blessing with a blowing with an unrelenting Force it's gonna take a stronger wind than this to keep me from my promises Homa because we're the children of God and we have the promise that God has given us let's not doubt because I want what I want you to do I want you to look at your situation and you say ask yourself do I really have a reason to expect failure and if you tell me yes I'll tell you me and you are not serving the same God cause he's never failed me yet [Applause] and let's not even say yet he's never failed me now that means that means it might be he'll never fail me he's never failed me he can't fail me come on musicians he's always on time he's worthy of your faith he's worthy of you believing in him never let anybody tell you anything different when it comes to the word of God all the answers to everything you need is in the word Hallelujah it's not in the world is in the word find your place in the scriptures and God will continue to reveal himself amen let's have a walk without reasoning let's have a walk without doubt and what does that become it becomes perfect faith that's what we want we want to live through perfect Faith amen because you think about it David used Goliath's own weapon against him the thing he brought to the fight was the very thing that caused his head to get cut off [Music] right and then I did not like the Act of Faith David takes Goliath's head and put it in a bag he says I want the evidence this is just just this is just how I see it David has the head of Goliath going to the next battle he gets to the battle he says hey now he uses Goliath's own sarcasm there's no need for innocent blood to be shared he says there's no need for us to fight he says but if y'all want to fight I want to show y'all something and he pulls the head of Goliath out he says just what I'll do to you like I did to your Champion if y'all want to fight amen amen now we ain't got to fight but if you want to fight this is going to be the results and church what you need to do is hold up your enemies hey Hallelujah and show that situation your victory [Applause] speak about what God has already proven what he's already done amen let's pray Lord God we love you we thank you in all things we know that we're we're just service down here Castro [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign
