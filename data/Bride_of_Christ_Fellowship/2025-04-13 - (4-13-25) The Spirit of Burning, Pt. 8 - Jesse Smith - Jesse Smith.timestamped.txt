[0:00] Pentecost by the grace of God. Acts
[0:02] chapter 2 verse
[0:07] one. I'd like to look at the spirit of
[0:09] burning. Uh this is part 8 by God's
[0:19] grace. Acts chapter 2 verse one.
[0:41] Hallelujah. So, I'd like to continue
[0:43] this series here. I may have maybe one
[0:45] or two more sermons here, maybe some
[0:47] more here by the grace of the Lord. But
[0:49] we trust the Holy Spirit will have his
[0:50] way today. Hallelujah. We just want to
[0:52] let the Holy Spirit move. Hallelujah.
[0:54] and meet every need. Hallelujah. There's
[0:56] no man or woman that can meet any need
[0:58] here. It has to be the Holy Ghost.
[1:00] Praise God. Hallelujah. That's the
[1:02] supernatural gospel that we enjoy, that
[1:04] we serve. Hallelujah. We serve God
[1:06] because it's God moving in us.
[1:08] Hallelujah. Uh man, I'm I'm here to
[1:11] plant. I'm here to water today. But I
[1:13] can't give any increase in anybody's
[1:15] life. Nor can you. We can only plant and
[1:17] water. You can water in someone's life.
[1:19] You can plant a a word in someone's
[1:20] life. But God has to give the increase.
[1:23] Hallelujah. And I love how God, he
[1:25] always shows up. Hallelujah. If you're
[1:26] ready, he'll show up. He's right on
[1:28] time. Hallelujah. Acts chapter 2, verse
[1:31] one. Now, we've been looking at this
[1:33] spirit of burning here, and we'll re
[1:34] review it briefly here. Uh, by the grace
[1:37] of the
[1:39] Lord. I want to do one through four.
[1:42] I'll read one and two, then we can read
[1:43] three and four together. And when the
[1:45] day of Pentecost was fully come, they
[1:47] were all with one accord in one place.
[1:50] And suddenly there came a sound from
[1:52] heaven as of a rushing mighty wind. So
[1:54] notice, you're not going to be ready for
[1:56] it when it comes. It's just going to
[1:57] come. Hallelujah. Just like Jesus said,
[2:00] you don't know where the wind blows,
[2:01] right? You don't know when it's going to
[2:02] blow, but it's going to blow.
[2:04] Hallelujah. I I told you at least three
[2:06] people have felt the wind of the Holy
[2:08] Ghost flow right through this room right
[2:09] here. Praise God. So we know Jesus
[2:11] Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
[2:13] forever. Hallelujah. It comes suddenly
[2:15] like that. Suddenly, and it filled all
[2:17] the house where they were sitting.
[2:20] Praise God. So, everyone felt the
[2:21] presence of God. Verse three. Let's read
[2:24] three and four. 1 2 3. And there
[2:26] appeared unto them cloven tongues like
[2:29] as of fire, and it sat upon each of
[2:33] them, and they were all filled with the
[2:35] Holy Ghost, and began to speak with
[2:38] other tongues as the spirit gave them
[2:40] utterance. Let's have one more word of
[2:42] prayer. Father God, Lord, meet the needs
[2:44] of your people today. Lord, we know this
[2:45] is how the church started and we know
[2:47] this is how the church continues. Lord
[2:49] God, without this, a church dies. Even
[2:51] as Zion said last night, Lord, uh the
[2:54] like Judas took the uh he he took the
[2:56] pale horse rider. He took spiritual
[2:58] death rather than Pentecost. Hallelujah.
[3:01] So, Father, thank you that the church
[3:02] today, our church lives today by the
[3:05] fire that fell on Pentecost. Hallelujah.
[3:07] It's still falling today, Lord God. Let
[3:09] your fire fall today and minister to
[3:11] your people. We'll give you thanks and
[3:13] praise. Thank you for each and everyone
[3:14] who's in the house of the Lord today and
[3:16] be with those that couldn't make it,
[3:18] Lord. May your spirit go to them and
[3:19] minister to them. And father, Lord, just
[3:22] open up your word in a special way today
[3:24] in Jesus Christ's name. And the saint
[3:26] said, amen. God bless you as you're
[3:28] being seated. Praise
[3:30] God. I'll have some uh notes to show
[3:33] therea by the grace of the
[3:38] Lord. So, I want to kind of pick up
[3:40] where we left off. uh would have been
[3:43] last Sunday by God's grace. We looked at
[3:45] part seven of the spirit of burning. Now
[3:48] just a a brief review. We've been
[3:50] through these five examples of Isaiah
[3:53] felt the burning of the Holy Ghost and
[3:56] that put him into service. Hallelujah.
[3:59] Jeremiah felt the burning. He said it's
[4:01] like fire in my bones and that kept him
[4:04] in service. So that's what will keep you
[4:06] from quitting the Christian faith. God
[4:09] will send his holy fire and it will burn
[4:12] in your heart and you'll say, "Oh, I was
[4:13] going to quit, but I'm not going to
[4:14] quit." Hallelujah. Because of the fire
[4:16] of God. Hallelujah. Cleop and his friend
[4:19] were walking on the road to Maymus and
[4:21] Jesus preached to them for about two or
[4:23] two and a half
[4:24] hours. And that they they said it burned
[4:27] within us as he talked to us along the
[4:29] way or preached to us along the way. And
[4:32] this burning produced a revival of joy
[4:35] in their hearts. It also produced the
[4:37] dissolving of all doubts. Is he arisen?
[4:39] Is Jesus was he the Messiah? Is he Is he
[4:42] alive? Is he dead? What what what was
[4:44] Jesus? The burning took away all the
[4:46] doubts. Hallelujah. And that's what the
[4:48] Holy Ghost in you will do. It will take
[4:50] away all your doubts. Praise God. That's
[4:52] right. And then David, of course, we saw
[4:54] he had the burning to meditate on his
[4:56] service. How much time do I have left?
[4:58] And am I going to live? How many years
[5:00] left do I have, Lord? How much time do I
[5:02] have to serve you? And he as he
[5:04] meditated on that, the burning fire came
[5:06] down and it showed him it wasn't the
[5:08] end. He was still going to be king.
[5:10] Hallelujah. You might feel like you're
[5:11] running for your life for many, many
[5:13] years. Like David was running for many,
[5:15] many years, but the spirit of fire, the
[5:17] spirit of burning came into his heart
[5:19] and let him know God was not done with
[5:20] him yet. Hallelujah. There was more
[5:22] service to come. Hallelujah. And then we
[5:25] looked at last week about the
[5:26] Pentecostal saints. They received the
[5:28] burning not just to start a service or
[5:30] keep them in service, but to be Jesus's
[5:33] true witnesses in their service to the
[5:36] ends of the earth. Praise God. Because
[5:38] God had finished up with the Jews as far
[5:40] as blinding them uh during their uh Old
[5:43] Testament church age and now God's
[5:45] putting in the New Covenant or the New
[5:47] Testament church and now they have power
[5:49] or the burning or fire to be witnesses.
[5:51] Hallelujah. And if you're born again,
[5:53] you've got a fire to be a witness in
[5:55] Akran. Hallelujah. or wherever you live.
[5:58] Hallelujah. Wherever you are, the Holy
[5:59] Ghost gives you power to be a witness.
[6:01] Hallelujah. That's our just brief
[6:03] review. And we saw also last week how on
[6:05] the day of Pentecost, the fire rested
[6:07] above them, the Bible said. So, see,
[6:10] once you're born again, the Holy Ghost
[6:12] rests upon you. Now, you're going have
[6:13] to fight off evil spirits and evil
[6:15] anointings. And you might do things, but
[6:17] said you might do things you never
[6:18] thought you'd do. You might get into s
[6:20] such traps or snares. But pretty soon,
[6:22] the fire of God is going to rebuke that
[6:24] evil spirit. The fire of God's going to
[6:26] cause that devil demon to flee.
[6:28] Hallelujah. And then you'll be free
[6:30] because the fire of God rests upon you.
[6:32] And not only does it rest upon you, it
[6:34] gives you rest. Hallelujah. So you don't
[6:37] rest in your ability. You don't you
[6:39] don't rest well. I know I'm going to
[6:40] heaven because of what I did. You don't
[6:42] rest upon yourself. You rest on Jesus
[6:44] Christ. Hallelujah. That's what we saw
[6:46] last week. It's rest for your soul.
[6:48] Jesus said in Matthew 11:29, "I come to
[6:51] give you rest so your souls can rest.
[6:53] You won't worry at night. Am I saved? Am
[6:55] I not lost? You might battle that, but
[6:58] ultimately the spirit of God will let
[6:59] you know. You are saved by grace, not of
[7:02] works, lest any man or woman should
[7:03] boast. Hallelujah. You're saved by the
[7:06] grace of almighty God. Hallelujah. Now,
[7:09] here's what I want to get to. Uh, and
[7:11] I'm going to do a little bit of review
[7:12] here. By the grace of God, Pentecost,
[7:15] the day of Pentecost was foreshadowed in
[7:17] Proverbs chapter 1. So, if you have your
[7:18] Bibles, let's go to Proverbs chapter 1.
[7:20] And we'll see some similarities here.
[7:22] This struck me a number of years ago
[7:24] when I was actually preaching the
[7:25] Proverbs series when brother William
[7:26] first came to uh America if I'm not
[7:29] mistaken. Proverbs chapter
[7:35] 1. Amazing book. I'm I think I'm
[7:38] currently in
[7:39] chapter chapter Yeah, I just finished
[7:41] chapter five this morning reading
[7:42] through or chapter four this morning and
[7:45] just amazing verses here.
[7:51] Amazing. But we see here in chapter one,
[7:54] uh, we're going to see some similarities
[7:55] here. Now, notice it's a woman in
[7:57] Proverbs, uh, chapter 1 verse 20. Wisdom
[8:01] is likened unto a woman. Hallelujah. Of
[8:04] course, God is likened unto a man. So,
[8:06] his spirit active among us is likened
[8:09] unto a female, right? Because a female's
[8:12] submission, right? And that's what the
[8:13] Holy Ghost is to teach us to be
[8:15] submissive to God.
[8:17] Hallelujah. So, Proverbs is like it unto
[8:19] a woman. It's God's spirit now dealing
[8:21] with his bride, his church. Hallelujah.
[8:25] So, we see it in verse uh verse 20.
[8:28] Wisdom crith without. She utterth her
[8:31] voice in the streets. So, the spirit of
[8:33] God goes out into the streets.
[8:36] Hallelujah. Goes out with you on the
[8:38] job. Hallelujah. Goes out with you to
[8:41] Walmart or Target, wherever you like to
[8:42] go. And the spirit of God is there
[8:45] trying to share the word with other
[8:48] people. It doesn't hide it. The wis the
[8:50] word of God doesn't hide itself. The
[8:52] word of God must be shared. Hallelujah.
[8:54] Now, it's nice we can share on internet
[8:55] and things like that. But the most
[8:57] impactful is face to face. Hallelujah.
[8:59] Amen. Because that's what it did at the
[9:01] beginning. It went out into the streets.
[9:03] It was like a woman. This feminine uh
[9:06] aspect here of the Holy Spirit. It's
[9:07] God's spirit moving out. Hallelujah. And
[9:10] it's moving to the church. And remember
[9:12] the church was on the day of Pentecost.
[9:14] It was likened unto a woman. And the
[9:16] Bible said uh 3,000 were added to the
[9:19] church. Church means called out. Called
[9:21] out of Egypt. Hallelujah. They're the
[9:24] called out ones. And Ephesians 5 says
[9:27] Christ is like the man in the
[9:29] relationship, right? And the woman's
[9:31] likened unto the church. It's a great
[9:34] mystery. But I speak concerning Christ
[9:36] and the church. Hallelujah. So, we see a
[9:39] great similarity here. And notice it's
[9:41] voice in the streets. That's what the
[9:43] Holy Ghost did on the day of Pentecost.
[9:46] They started in the upper room, but
[9:48] their worship got so loud. They were
[9:50] declaring how wonderful God is. Oh,
[9:52] Jesus is wonderful. God is wonderful. Uh
[9:54] he he he took our sins away on the
[9:57] cross. It's so wonderful to be forgiven.
[9:59] Hallelujah. And I bet Peter was right
[10:01] there. So wonderful wonderful for me to
[10:02] be forgiven even though I denied him
[10:04] three times. Hallelujah. Though I
[10:06] disgraced my Lord, though I though I
[10:08] disgraced the the the Messiah three
[10:10] times publicly, yet I'm forgiven. And
[10:13] yet he'd still send me the Holy Ghost.
[10:15] Hallelujah. I certainly don't deserve
[10:17] it. But his it shows how rich in mercy
[10:19] he is. Hallelujah. And he's out there.
[10:22] No doubt he's out there because I I feel
[10:24] the fire of God. I feel the power of
[10:26] God. I'm forgiven. God fill me just as
[10:29] he promised. Hallelujah. Amen. This is
[10:31] what he promised me, right? He said, "Go
[10:33] up to Jerusalem. wait there until you're
[10:35] endued with power or clothed with power
[10:39] from on high. Hallelujah. And God sent
[10:42] it. And so in chapter one in Proverbs,
[10:44] the spirit of God as a woman goes out in
[10:46] the streets and starts spreading the
[10:48] word of God. That's what they did on the
[10:50] day of Pentecost. Hallelujah. Look at
[10:53] verse 21. She crith in the chief place
[10:54] of
[10:55] concourse. In the openings of the gates
[10:58] in the city, she utterth her words,
[11:00] saying, "Now, if you go back and look at
[11:01] it on a map, where the upper room is is
[11:04] right near Caiaphas's house. Kai, it's
[11:08] it's almost a couple streets over.
[11:11] Caiaphas's house where they took Jesus
[11:13] to put him on trial the night of his
[11:15] arrest." So, one of the first people,
[11:17] Glory, one of the first people that
[11:19] heard Jesus is alive. The Holy Ghost is
[11:21] here. Amen. One of the first people that
[11:23] heard it was Caiaphas and his family,
[11:25] the one who crucified him. Hallelujah.
[11:27] See, because wisdom has to go out and
[11:29] say, "No, you crucified him. This was
[11:30] the Messiah." But his spirit's here.
[11:32] It's better that that he was crucified
[11:34] because now his spirit can go upon every
[11:36] believer. Hallelujah. And the spirit of
[11:39] God is not confined to just one person,
[11:40] Jesus. Now it's in the many membered
[11:43] bride of Jesus Christ. It's in the many
[11:45] membered church of the Lord Jesus
[11:47] Christ. Hallelujah. Amen. And Caiaphas
[11:50] was one of the first ones, no doubt, in
[11:52] his family and his servants because he
[11:53] was a rich man that got to hear that
[11:56] Jesus is alive and the Holy Ghost has
[11:58] been sent from heaven. Hallelujah.
[12:01] Glory. Now look at uh she uttered her
[12:04] words saying verse
[12:05] 22. Now notice what's her first words?
[12:09] It's a
[12:10] rebuke. How many know that brother
[12:12] Brandham used Acts chapter 2? Brother
[12:14] Ram used Acts chapter 2 for his
[12:16] indictment sermon in
[12:19] 1963. Indictment means to declare
[12:22] someone is guilty. An indictment.
[12:26] Peter on the greatest day was the
[12:28] greatest day for the church. Now the
[12:30] greatest day was the resurrection. But
[12:31] the birthday of the church, the birth of
[12:33] the church, what does he do? He brings
[12:34] the word, but he also brings an
[12:36] indictment. Sound familiar? Like the
[12:38] spirit of judgment.
[12:40] We all been paying attention these last
[12:41] eight services, right?
[12:43] He has to bring an indictment. He has to
[12:45] bring the spirit of judgment before the
[12:48] spirit of burning can come.
[12:51] So look what this woman does in verse
[12:53] 22. How long you simple ones? That means
[12:55] foolish ones. So she goes out there and
[12:59] she sees a bunch of foolishnesses. She
[13:00] said, "How long are you going to be a
[13:02] fool?
[13:04] Why would you remain a fool when wisdom
[13:07] is here?" Hallelujah.
[13:09] Why would you remain in sin and be a
[13:11] foolish type of person? Why be a foolish
[13:13] virgin? Can I say like that? Because the
[13:16] wisdom is here. The wise virgin is here.
[13:18] Hallelujah.
[13:20] Why be foolish? Don't be foolish because
[13:23] the word of God is here today.
[13:28] Why do you love foolishness? See, people
[13:30] just love their pleasures of sin. And
[13:32] remember it today, it's a battle for
[13:34] which one do you love more? Will you be
[13:36] a lover of pleasure or will you be a
[13:38] lover of God? Make the choice.
[13:40] Hallelujah. Amen.
[13:43] This is serving God is all about love.
[13:45] You We've got to give God all of our
[13:47] love. Hallelujah.
[13:50] That's right. And that's what Jesus
[13:51] said. That's why people are lost because
[13:53] they love the world more than they love
[13:55] Jesus. What a sermon Nicodemus heard in
[13:58] John chapter
[14:00] 3. He heard this beautiful sermon. He
[14:02] heard John 3:16. For God so loved the
[14:05] world that he gave his only begotten son
[14:07] that whosoever believeth him should not
[14:09] perish but have everlasting life. And he
[14:12] heard you must be born again. How can I
[14:14] enter in my mother's womb again? He said
[14:16] you're a master yet you don't even
[14:17] understand spiritual things. Oh, let's
[14:20] be careful what we call ourselves.
[14:22] Hallelujah. Not to pride exalt ourselves
[14:24] like we know something. We don't know
[14:26] nothing except God opens our
[14:28] understanding. Praise God.
[14:31] But hold your spot there and let's go to
[14:34] John 3:1
[14:36] 19. I just feel impressed to say I
[14:38] didn't get a chance to put in my notes
[14:39] because uh just didn't have the
[14:44] time. Let me just share this. It's all
[14:46] about
[14:48] love. That woman goes out and says, "How
[14:50] long will you be a
[14:52] fool? Don't be foolish. Don't love the
[14:55] world. Love God."
[14:57] Hallelujah. Look at 19.
[15:00] This is the condemnation that light is
[15:02] coming to the world and Jesus is the
[15:05] light and men love darkness rather than
[15:09] light because their deeds were evil. So
[15:11] see it all he just talked about uh he
[15:14] just talked about John 3:16 and and if
[15:16] you believe you're saved but then he
[15:18] goes down people are going to be
[15:19] condemned. In other words, they're not
[15:21] going to be saved because they love the
[15:23] world more than they love God.
[15:26] It's all boils down to love. That's why
[15:28] the greatest commandment is to love God
[15:29] with all your heart, soul, mind, and
[15:32] strength.
[15:34] Hallelujah.
[15:36] Hallelujah. And let me just remind you,
[15:38] brother Austin and I were talking on
[15:39] Monday, or was it Monday, brother? Yeah,
[15:40] it was Monday or Tuesday. Tuesday. And
[15:43] brother Austin and I were just talking.
[15:44] We were reminded of how Joseph, he just
[15:46] ran from the evil. And that was a real
[15:49] man.
[15:51] A real man, a woman will run from
[15:54] wickedness. That doesn't make you look
[15:55] weak. That makes you look strong. You're
[15:57] running to your city of refuge.
[15:59] Hallelujah. You're running to victory.
[16:01] You're running to mercy. You're running
[16:03] to forgiveness. You're running away from
[16:05] temptation. And you're running to the
[16:07] power, the source of power. Hallelujah.
[16:10] That's right.
[16:14] Amen. See, that's why people go to hell.
[16:16] They love the world more than they love
[16:19] God. Verse 20. For everyone that doeth
[16:21] evil hates the light, neither cometh to
[16:24] the light, lest his deed should be
[16:26] reproved. Now, we're all going to sin.
[16:28] So, the what the difference with us is
[16:30] that when we sin, we'll go to God and
[16:32] say, "God, let the spirit of judgment
[16:34] come on me and let me judge myself that
[16:36] I'm guilty and I've broken your
[16:38] commands. I'm not blaming anybody else.
[16:41] It's my fault."
[16:43] That's the spirit of judgment. That's
[16:44] what Isaiah said. He said, "I'm a man of
[16:46] unclean lips. I dwell amongst unclean
[16:49] people." Amen. He didn't put it off on
[16:51] anybody else. He said, "I'm unclean just
[16:53] like the people on me." And God honored
[16:55] that so much. He said, "Praise God." He
[16:57] said, "I'll forgive." He said, "Praise
[16:59] myself." He said, "Glory." And he said,
[17:01] "Because you've judged yourself the
[17:03] right way, I'm sending you the burning
[17:05] of the Holy Ghost." Hallelujah. He said,
[17:07] "Angel save him. Go get the tongs and
[17:09] bring a coal off the fire of the altar
[17:12] and set it on his lips and take away his
[17:15] iniquity. Take away his sin." Church, it
[17:17] can be done in a moment. Just like that,
[17:20] your iniquity can be taken from you. You
[17:22] can be clean that fast if you just
[17:24] confess your sin and let heaven come
[17:26] down and anoint you. Hallelujah. Amen.
[17:30] Amen. And then God's like, who am I
[17:32] going to send? And Isaiah's like, I'll
[17:33] go. I've had the fire of God on my lips.
[17:37] I'll go share the word. I'll go speak
[17:38] the word. I'll be a servant. I'll go
[17:40] have a ministry because I've recognized
[17:43] I'm a sinner. Therefore, God forgave me.
[17:45] And now I can speak for God
[17:48] because I've got the spirit of burning
[17:50] and the church said,
[17:53] "Hallelujah." George, that's the more I
[17:56] realize, the more I live, the longer I
[17:57] live. That's what happened to me when I
[17:58] first preached. I told you the story. I
[18:01] fasted for a couple days before that
[18:02] first week I preached for brother
[18:04] Brooks. But before I went out there, I
[18:06] was shaking behind, you couldn't see it.
[18:08] There was a nice song service, but
[18:09] behind the curtain, I'm shaking like a
[18:11] like a leaf. God, show me if I'm a
[18:13] preacher. Show me if I'm a preacher. a
[18:15] vindicate. If I'm a preacher and I
[18:17] preach and the whole altar is full of
[18:19] people repenting and getting right with
[18:21] God, confessing their sin, God knows how
[18:24] to back up his word. Hallelujah. Amen.
[18:26] But see, first you got to have the
[18:28] spirit of burning. God's got to burn out
[18:30] your own desires, your own sinful
[18:32] nature. God's got to burn that out and
[18:34] he's got to place his spirit in there
[18:35] and then God can use you for his
[18:37] service.
[18:40] That's right.
[18:42] So see church, verse 20 says we got to
[18:44] come to the light. Yes, we're all going
[18:46] to sin. So when we fall short, come back
[18:48] to God. Don't run away from God. Come
[18:50] back to God.
[18:53] Like Adam stayed away. He went and hid
[18:55] from God. Well, we all do that. We might
[18:57] hide for a few hours, but then we'll
[18:58] come back to God. And the church said,
[19:00] "You might hide for a week, months. Some
[19:01] people might be week, weeks, years,
[19:04] decades. It's up to you. You can hide as
[19:07] long as you want. But I suggest you come
[19:09] out and just admit to God what you've
[19:11] just come to the light. Praise God.
[19:13] Don't hide away in darkness. Don't hide
[19:15] where it's dark. Come out of that
[19:17] darkness and come into what the Bible
[19:19] says is this marvelous light.
[19:21] Hallelujah.
[19:23] Glory. Because listen, church, we all
[19:24] got mistakes. You the the more light you
[19:26] shine on something, the more uh flaws
[19:28] and details and wrinkles you see.
[19:30] Hallelujah. And that's normal. But that
[19:32] just lets us know we're the church. We
[19:35] need a savior. We need a redeemer. We
[19:37] need a husband. We need amazing grace.
[19:40] We need eternal love. We need a love
[19:42] that doesn't judge. We need divine love.
[19:44] And God gives us the divine love of God.
[19:46] Hallelujah.
[19:48] That song that we sing, prone to wonder.
[19:51] Lord, I feel that. Prone to leave the
[19:53] God I love. That's all of us. That's
[19:54] that's more real to me than it's ever
[19:56] been before. My human nature is so prone
[19:59] to leave the word of God.
[20:02] Our our our human nature so easily to
[20:04] forget the word of God. But what's the
[20:07] end of that song
[20:08] say? The end of the song says, "Lord,
[20:11] come down and seal me for your courts
[20:14] above. I'm prone to wonder, but Lord,
[20:17] come down. Set a mark upon my soul that
[20:19] I belong to you." Praise God. I'm prone
[20:23] to wonder. I'm I'm prone to leave the
[20:25] God I love. But God, I love you. Come
[20:27] down and mark me so that I'll always be
[20:29] yours. I'll never lose my salvation.
[20:32] I'll never lose who you made me to be,
[20:34] but I'll be a child of God that you
[20:36] called me to be. Praise God.
[20:39] Hallelujah.
[20:43] Verse 21. But he that doeth truth, see,
[20:45] you got to do the truth, not just talk
[20:47] about it, not just hear it. You've got
[20:49] to do it.
[20:51] If the Bible says it, do it.
[20:55] And then watch God back up his word.
[20:59] That's right, church. do the
[21:02] word, he that doeth the truth comes to
[21:05] the light, that his deeds may be made
[21:07] manifest, that they are wrought or
[21:10] formed in
[21:11] God. See, you come to God, you confess
[21:14] any evil deeds, and then you come to
[21:16] God, and God will give you good deeds to
[21:18] do. We're supposed to be zealous of good
[21:20] works. Uh we come to God, God washes us
[21:23] clean like just like Isaiah. And then he
[21:25] sends us out. He gives us a commission.
[21:27] For some of you, it might be mothering.
[21:29] That's your commission. For some of you,
[21:30] you might be fathering. For some of you,
[21:32] you might be preaching or music
[21:33] ministry. But everybody's sent out to do
[21:35] something for Jesus.
[21:38] And you come to the light. You confess
[21:40] your deeds. And then God forgives you.
[21:43] And then he sends you out with a real
[21:44] love. I'm forgiven. Oh, how could I not
[21:46] love this God that would forgive me?
[21:49] Hallelujah. All right. Good. Now, back
[21:52] back to Proverbs 1.
[21:57] So the first thing they cry out is she
[21:59] cries out as foolish ones, why will you
[22:01] stay like a fool so
[22:04] long? That's right. Because I now verse
[22:07] 24. No, I'm sorry. Verse 20 uh 22. How
[22:11] long you simple ones will you love
[22:12] simplicity? And the scorners delight in
[22:14] their scorning and fools hate
[22:17] knowledge. So see this is the the
[22:19] reality. You can't Jesus said you can't
[22:21] love God and mammon at the same time.
[22:24] You can't serve both masters. Paul said
[22:26] you can't drink from both cups. The cups
[22:28] of devils and the cup of communion.
[22:32] And really, he said when we drink from
[22:33] the cup of the world, he says like you
[22:35] hate the word of God. Right? Your sin
[22:37] nature will always hate the word of God.
[22:39] That's why you've got to bring it into
[22:41] subjection. That's why you got to make
[22:43] it a slave. Hallelujah. That's right.
[22:47] Now, here we are. Verse
[22:49] 23. No, actually, you know, uh Acts
[22:52] 2:23. Yes. Peter gives the indictment.
[22:54] He said, "You're a wicked and adulterous
[22:56] generation. You've crucified the Lord of
[22:59] glory."
[23:00] So, see the same thing. They're both out
[23:02] in the streets. The spirit of God's out
[23:04] in the street in the days of Solomon. It
[23:05] was prophetic here of how the Holy Ghost
[23:08] will go out into the streets and tell
[23:09] them, "Why are we going to remain a
[23:11] unbeliever? Why remain without the Holy
[23:13] Ghost? You can have the Holy Ghost. You
[23:15] just got to hate to be a fool and you
[23:17] got to want to be wise." Hallelujah.
[23:20] How long? How? In other words, the Holy
[23:22] Ghost like, "How long do I got to wait?
[23:25] How
[23:26] long?" It's this pure woman. This is
[23:28] this it's this virgin woman, right?
[23:30] She's out there. She out there on the
[23:32] streets. How long, my children? How long
[23:34] are you going to wait? Why not Why not
[23:35] make it today? Praise God. Why waste
[23:38] another day? Hallelujah.
[23:41] Why would people do that? Because they
[23:43] love the world more than they love the
[23:44] things of God. Oh, but God came to us
[23:48] and God helped us to love him more than
[23:50] the world. Praise God. That's right.
[23:54] Glory. Look at them say the same thing.
[23:57] And look at verse 123. What does she
[23:59] say? Turn you at my reproof. Recognize
[24:03] it's the wisdom of God trying to get you
[24:06] to turn your ways.
[24:08] It's the wisdom of God. It's the Holy
[24:10] Spirit trying to rebuke the sinner.
[24:14] Turn. That words word re means repent,
[24:16] right? Do a 180. Turn from that path.
[24:20] and recognize it's the love of God
[24:22] saying, "How long will you live like
[24:24] this?" Well, isn't it time to change?
[24:26] Why do you got to keep on the same path?
[24:28] Today is the day of salvation.
[24:30] Hallelujah.
[24:33] He says, "If you," she says, "if you
[24:34] turn, I will pour out my spirit unto
[24:37] you." Oh my, what a promise. Amen.
[24:39] Church, you and I have a promise. If we
[24:42] turn from our sins, God is going to send
[24:44] the spirit of burning. Hallelujah. He's
[24:47] going to send the spirit of God upon us
[24:49] and we'll walk in a fresh power, a fresh
[24:51] anointing. Hallelujah. A transformed
[24:54] mind. Hallelujah. The Bible said the
[24:56] light grows greater and greater. It
[24:58] actually says in Proverbs, unto a
[25:00] perfect day, our lives get more and more
[25:03] with the illumination of the word of
[25:05] God. How many see the world better than
[25:06] you ever have before?
[25:09] I do. I see Israel, the beast we
[25:11] preached on last week, right, Brother
[25:12] Chris? The beast in Babylon. Remember
[25:14] the beast last week? I see it more
[25:15] clearly than it ever has been.
[25:17] Hallelujah. Is that right, brothers?
[25:19] Remember, we looked at the beast last
[25:20] week. I can see the beast system, the
[25:22] Roman Catholic Church system. You can
[25:24] see it more clearly than ever. And we
[25:26] can see the highway of holiness. Glory.
[25:28] The word of God, the righteousness of
[25:30] God is also more clear than ever.
[25:35] I'm just reminded that Wizard of Oz,
[25:36] they they stole that yellow brick road.
[25:38] They stole that. That's actually the
[25:39] highway of holiness. Hallelujah.
[25:42] Devil's always stealing God's
[25:45] ideas.
[25:48] Glory. The Holy Ghost woman there, the
[25:50] the spirit of wisdom, she said, "If you
[25:53] turn and get out of your foolish ways, I
[25:56] will pour out my spirit upon you." See,
[25:59] because when you turn from the world,
[26:00] you come to the woman, right? You come
[26:01] to the Holy
[26:02] Ghost. Hallelujah. And then if you come
[26:04] to her, she's going to pour out the
[26:05] spirit of God upon you.
[26:09] Glory. Hallelujah.
[26:13] and I will make known my words unto you.
[26:15] And that's church, once you get the Holy
[26:17] Ghost, that's when you finally start to
[26:19] understand the
[26:20] word. How many wonderful revelations,
[26:22] honey, have we had over all these years
[26:24] now? My goodness, we're just revelation
[26:27] after revelation. It's just unfolding
[26:30] after
[26:31] unfolding. Hallelujah. And it's strength
[26:35] for the journey. It's mana for the
[26:37] journey as we on our journey to heaven.
[26:39] Hallelujah.
[26:42] And so, see this types out then the day
[26:44] of Pentecost where Peter quotes Joel
[26:47] 2:28 and says, "This is that which Joel
[26:51] spoke of, saith God, I will pour out my
[26:54] spirit on all flesh." Hallelujah.
[26:58] Who'd he poured out on the people that
[27:00] were shut in with him? Hallelujah.
[27:03] Glory. They shut in for 10 days. God
[27:06] poured out his spirit on them. Now,
[27:08] Brother said that was just to fulfill
[27:09] the 50-day type. He said, "Now, you
[27:12] don't need 10 days." He said, "Now you
[27:13] just need a a surrendered, sanctified
[27:16] life, and God will pour out his Holy
[27:18] Ghost on you." It's proven in Acts
[27:20] chapter 10, while Peter yet spake the
[27:23] word, the Holy Ghost fell on all them
[27:25] that heard the word of God. Amen.
[27:28] Cornelius didn't need 10 days to get the
[27:30] Holy Ghost. He just needed a preacher
[27:32] that was preaching it because he was
[27:34] already praying and fasting. And the
[27:36] church said, "Amen." See, he was already
[27:38] praying, already fasting, already in the
[27:41] word. He was already giving alms to poor
[27:43] people.
[27:46] Hallelujah. And so, you got to you got
[27:48] to you got to hear the Holy Spirit.
[27:50] That's what the Holy Spirit will lead
[27:51] you into. Prayer, almsgiving, fasting.
[27:54] It leads you into that. And then when
[27:56] you hear the word of God, one of those
[27:57] days, the God's going to pour out his
[27:59] spirit right on you, and you'll be
[28:01] baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[28:03] How many times have I seen it? Praise
[28:05] God. Glory to God. Like that brother
[28:08] from uh Iowa, he always reminds me when
[28:10] I go out there, Liz Paul, he's always
[28:12] like, "Yeah, I remember when you prayed
[28:13] for me, I got the Holy Ghost." I'm like,
[28:14] "Yeah, I remember that. Praise God." He
[28:17] just started throwing up his hands and
[28:18] crying and weeping and glorifying God.
[28:20] And he left that place knewing he had
[28:22] more power than when he walked into that
[28:24] place. Hallelujah. And now, church, now
[28:27] look what he's doing. Now he's doing uh
[28:30] he's doing concerts every couple months
[28:32] bringing hundreds of message people
[28:34] together to sing and worship Jesus. See,
[28:36] he's in service for the king. He's not a
[28:40] preacher. Wait, no, he did preach. Yeah,
[28:42] he did preach. Yeah, he did preach. He
[28:45] is a preacher. That's right. Glory. He's
[28:47] a preacher. And I love it. The Holy
[28:49] Ghost that was on me filled him. Praise
[28:52] God. That's how you get the Holy Ghost.
[28:53] You got to have somebody who's got the
[28:55] Holy Ghost pray for you to get the Holy
[28:56] Ghost. Praise God. Amen.
[28:59] Yeah. Now he's preaching and he's now
[29:01] got a ministry where he brings I mean pe
[29:04] message people they they fly or drive
[29:06] all around the nation to come worship
[29:08] Jesus Christ. Now Jesus Christ is
[29:10] getting more praise than the young
[29:11] people because this man's got the Holy
[29:13] Ghost. He's got a service for God.
[29:15] That's what we need today. Young men and
[29:17] women with a service for God.
[29:19] Hallelujah.
[29:22] That's
[29:23] right. because God poured out his spirit
[29:26] and he's never been the same since that.
[29:28] And you know what sermon I preached that
[29:29] day? You know what sermon it was? The 12
[29:30] New Testament
[29:32] mysteries. Some people think I'm off the
[29:34] deep end. If I am, then I'm I've fallen
[29:37] into the deep end of Jesus. Hallelujah.
[29:39] I'm falling more in deep in love with
[29:41] God. Hallelujah. But all I know is that
[29:43] God vindicated that sermon and gave him
[29:45] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And look
[29:47] at him now.
[29:48] Hallelujah. Glory. Praise God. I didn't
[29:51] have to go back. I didn't have to go
[29:52] back and tutor him and kind of show him
[29:54] what to do. The Holy Ghost was already
[29:56] in him. He's had to keep feet of the
[29:58] camel. He's had to keep wire of the
[30:00] camel. And the camel will take him where
[30:02] he needs to go. Praise God.
[30:10] Hallelujah. Now, there's at least two
[30:13] types of the spirit of burning that fell
[30:16] on the day of Pentecost. It's the feast
[30:18] of weeks and the Tower of Babel. And I
[30:20] don't think I've ever preached the Tower
[30:22] of Babel, have I? I could forget. I
[30:24] preach a lot of
[30:25] sermons. 80 sermons times I've been a
[30:29] preacher for 20 21 years. That's a lot
[30:32] of sermons. I've really forgot most of
[30:34] what I preached by now. I've I've
[30:36] forgotten most of what I preached
[30:39] because you just can't remember
[30:40] everything. I go back in my old notes,
[30:42] I'm like, "Glory, glory. I forgot about
[30:45] Hallelujah. I'm I know less or I've
[30:48] forgotten more than I even know." Oh,
[30:49] praise
[30:50] God. But that was fresh to me today. The
[30:53] tower the Tower of Babel is a it's a
[30:55] type of
[30:57] Pentecost where God does the reverse at
[31:00] Pentecost. So, I'm going to close with
[31:02] that in a little bit. I'm nowhere near
[31:04] closing. So, don't misunderstand me. I'm
[31:06] not closing.
[31:08] Hallelujah. Now, I've showed you this
[31:10] before. I'm sorry. This is the highest
[31:11] quality image. It's a little blurry, but
[31:13] remember um at the Exodus in Exodus
[31:16] chapter 12, God starts a new year with
[31:19] Moses. He said, "This this day, first
[31:21] day of Nissan, and we got some good
[31:23] Nissan's out there, too. This first day
[31:26] of Nissan is going to be a beginning of
[31:28] years to
[31:29] you because this is when I start
[31:32] bringing you out of Egypt."
[31:35] So, they came out of Egypt in Nissan.
[31:39] Then they had the uh the Passover, the
[31:41] unleaven bread, first fruits. This is
[31:43] day uh one Passover, day two, day three.
[31:45] First fruits is on the third day after
[31:47] Passover. Now two months later in the
[31:50] third month was the feast of Pentecost.
[31:53] Pentecost means
[31:54] 50. The but the other word the the the
[31:57] other word is the feast of weeks because
[31:59] there's going to be lots of weeks. Uh
[32:01] there's three months of weeks that this
[32:03] feast is going to
[32:05] last. So it's going to be a very long
[32:07] feast. And the church said it's actually
[32:09] the longest feast is the feast of
[32:12] Pentecost. It lasts for the third month,
[32:15] third, fourth, fifth, sixth lasts for
[32:17] four months. And then in the seventh
[32:19] month, you start the the day of atone.
[32:21] I'm sorry, the the feast of trumpets,
[32:23] then day of atonement, then feast of
[32:25] tabernacles.
[32:27] Okay. Now, this shouldn't be too awfully
[32:29] unfamiliar. I preach it over the years.
[32:32] Uh but I thought we could do a review.
[32:35] Now, this is the one I showed. This is
[32:36] another way to look at it. You have
[32:38] three you have you basically have three
[32:40] main uh three main feasts. Passover
[32:43] actually has three feasts in it. Then
[32:45] you have the feast of Pentecost. Then
[32:48] you have the feast of tabernacles which
[32:49] contains three in it. Now they all have
[32:51] a type. Passover represented the cross
[32:53] of Jesus Christ. Unleavened bread
[32:57] represented where uh Jesus took all of
[33:00] our sin and he went down to hell and he
[33:02] took the keys of death and hell. There's
[33:04] no leaven. There was no sin anymore.
[33:07] Jesus dropped the charges. Hallelujah.
[33:09] We sang that on Wednesday. That was such
[33:11] a great song. Hallelujah. Not because we
[33:12] sang it, but the person who wrote it.
[33:15] And then the third day was the feast of
[33:17] first fruits. They waved uh uh they
[33:20] waved the first harvest. And that was
[33:22] represent of Jesus was the first one to
[33:24] raise from the dead. God waved Jesus
[33:27] before everybody and said, "If you
[33:29] believe, you shall live also like this
[33:30] one."
[33:32] Hallelujah. Glory. And then on the day
[33:35] of Pentecost, we'll get to that, they
[33:37] waved two
[33:38] loaves. 50 days after Passover was
[33:41] Pentecost, and they waved two loaves.
[33:43] And then it went on, there was actually
[33:45] two harvests in the time of Pentecost.
[33:47] Barley harvest and wheat harvest. Barley
[33:50] is a less quality type of a a grain and
[33:53] bread. The wheat grain is much more uh
[33:56] appreciated and
[33:58] liked. So I say like this, the best for
[34:01] last. Hallelujah. I'm talking about the
[34:03] I'm talking about the rapture of the
[34:05] whole New Testament
[34:07] church. The body was the day of
[34:10] Pentecost. But there's going to be one
[34:12] more wave. And church, she's waved not
[34:14] on the ground. She's waved in the sky
[34:16] because she's going to meet Jesus in the
[34:18] air. Praise
[34:19] God.
[34:22] Hallelujah. And then after we go in the
[34:24] rapture, the trumpets will be blown by
[34:26] the Moses and Elijah prophet. either
[34:29] them real men or men anointed with their
[34:31] spirits. And remember that's scriptural
[34:33] because uh Elijah's spirit came five
[34:36] times. Moses spirit came on 70 people.
[34:40] Remember this? Some that struck me. I
[34:42] was talking to somebody recently. God
[34:43] said put my or Moses said put my spirit
[34:46] on 70 others. So they had the 70 people
[34:48] had the spirit of Moses along with
[34:50] Moses.
[34:52] Hallelujah. So e either be Moses. Now I
[34:55] believe it'll be Moses and Elijah
[34:56] personally. I believe it'll be them, but
[34:57] I could be wrong.
[34:59] But God can take the spirit of those men
[35:01] and put it on two men. And those two
[35:04] prophets will call the people together
[35:06] for the day of atonement. And that's the
[35:08] day where the the the goat was slayed.
[35:10] There was the the the scapegoat and the
[35:12] goat that died. And that was the day
[35:14] that all the sins of Israel were
[35:15] forgiven in one day. And the Bible said
[35:18] in Isaiah 66 that a nation will be born
[35:21] in one day. All the sin will be taken
[35:23] away from Israel. All the blinders are
[35:25] put away. Shall weep. There it is. the
[35:27] spirit of judgment shall weep from house
[35:29] to house. Hallelujah. Saying, "How do we
[35:31] do it? How do we crucify our Messiah?"
[35:33] We did it. We're guilty. We're indicted
[35:35] for crucifying our Messiah. But then
[35:37] Jesus will come and he'll baptize them
[35:39] with the spirit of burning. 144,000 will
[35:42] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[35:47] And then the feast of
[35:49] tabernacles was where they would set up
[35:51] and for seven days they would sit in
[35:52] tabernacles reminding them that they
[35:55] used to live in the wilderness. And that
[35:56] types, of course, the thousand-year
[35:58] millennial reign where we will build
[36:01] houses and we're going to live in them.
[36:06] Hallelujah. Now, remember, men were to
[36:08] appear three times. And I'm not going to
[36:09] read all through this. I can see I'm
[36:11] already going too far here or too
[36:13] long. I just want to say this though
[36:15] before he gets this. Moses says, "Don't
[36:18] make any mention of your other gods."
[36:21] And church, that's what we got to do. We
[36:22] can't let the devil bring old memories
[36:24] back. We can't let the devil uh try to
[36:28] bring up things that we used to enjoy in
[36:30] sin. Don't even talk about it unless
[36:33] you're giving somebody a rebuke warning
[36:34] by the Holy Ghost or testifying like I
[36:37] do, like how bad it was with cigarettes
[36:38] and and immoral magazines and movies.
[36:41] But don't don't dwell on it. Uh and
[36:43] don't don't make it seem like it was
[36:44] good. It was evil. Hallelujah. It was
[36:46] death. Hallelujah.
[36:48] That's right. So don't even talk about
[36:51] that. Three times a year you'll keep all
[36:54] the men, all the leaders had to come
[36:56] three times of a year and worship
[36:58] God. Now we got to come three times a
[37:01] week. Now I like that. I didn't think of
[37:05] that. Unleaven
[37:07] bread. The first one, feast of the
[37:10] harvest, first fruits of thy labors, and
[37:13] the in gathering. That's the wheat
[37:15] harvest. And then he says it again. And
[37:17] then three times here, all the males
[37:18] shall appear before the Lord thy God.
[37:21] And he said, "Thou shalt not offer the
[37:22] blood of my sacrifice with leaven bread,
[37:25] neither shall the fat of my sacrifice
[37:26] remain until the morning. The first of
[37:28] the first fruits of thy lamb shalt thou
[37:30] bring." So in other words, there's your
[37:31] tithes. Always bring your tithes. When
[37:32] you come to worship God, always bring a
[37:34] tithe. A tithe belongs to God. It
[37:37] doesn't even belong to you.
[37:40] That's why it's so easy for us to give
[37:41] tithe because it's not even mine. It's
[37:43] God's. And God's going to use that to
[37:46] help the ministry prepare me for the
[37:48] coming of Jesus. Hallelujah. That's
[37:51] right.
[37:52] And then God promises, I'll send an
[37:54] angel before you. And how many know you
[37:56] got an angel? The Bible said the angel
[37:58] Lord encamps around all those that fear
[38:00] God. So see, it's a beautiful type of
[38:03] what's happened in the
[38:04] spiritual. Okay? And I'm not going to go
[38:06] through all this here. Uh we'll have to
[38:09] get to later. But here's a more
[38:10] simplified version for some of us who
[38:12] just like
[38:13] simplicity. I like simplicity. So in the
[38:15] spring they basically had three. And as
[38:18] you as you transition to summer, there
[38:19] was the Pentecost that lasted four
[38:21] months. And then the fall, you had
[38:22] trumpets, atonement, tabernacle. Now,
[38:23] does that help anybody by God's grace?
[38:25] Okay, just it just gives you another
[38:26] view. It's a less complicated, less
[38:28] details, but you can kind of see this is
[38:30] how their spiritual year went. Now, they
[38:32] also had a natural year, which was all
[38:34] the other months after that is called
[38:36] the the natural
[38:38] year. Now, remember this. I'm bringing
[38:40] this back from when I preached on Zion,
[38:42] the Zion series and David series. The
[38:44] Bible says we are right now at the Mount
[38:49] Zion. Hallelujah. Which basically means
[38:52] we're worshiping at the throne of Jesus
[38:54] Christ right
[38:55] now. In other words, in other words, uh
[38:58] the the throne of Jesus right now in
[39:00] heaven, that's like the top of of the
[39:02] mountain. Hallelujah. And the Bible said
[39:05] we've come. I want everybody say that
[39:07] I've come. Ready? I've come. Now say to
[39:10] Mount Zion. To Mount Zion. Hallelujah.
[39:13] But you're at the spiritual one right
[39:14] now. Now, it's nice if you can afford to
[39:16] go see the natural one. That's nice. I
[39:18] don't have enough money right now, but
[39:20] maybe later. I'd like to see the natural
[39:23] one, but doesn't matter. Either way, I'm
[39:25] going to be there. Praise God. Whether
[39:26] in this life or the millennium.
[39:28] Hallelujah. Either way, I'm going to be
[39:30] there. Hallelujah. Because I'm going to
[39:32] be wherever Jesus is, because that's how
[39:33] I'm ordering my life right now as well.
[39:36] I'm only going to walk how Jesus tells
[39:38] me to walk. Hallelujah. That's how I
[39:41] know I love him because I keep his
[39:43] commands. Now, the word Zion means
[39:46] lofty. So, lofty mountain. We're
[39:49] worshiping at a lofty mountain right
[39:52] now. Okay? And there's at least five
[39:54] meanings. Uh I'm going to skip that
[39:56] because I got I got those five meanings
[39:58] from the the lexicon and the dictionary.
[40:00] I'm just going to give you the a bridge
[40:02] version. Zion is the taller southwestern
[40:05] mountain from Mariah. Hallelujah. Mariah
[40:09] was where uh Abraham took up Isaac to
[40:12] sacrifice him and he and he was going to
[40:14] kill his son, but God provided a
[40:16] substitute. It was on Mount Mariah.
[40:20] Hallelujah. Go Jehovah Gyra. I'll
[40:23] provide myself a sacrifice.
[40:26] Hallelujah. Zion also means the entire
[40:29] city of Jerusalem because there's over
[40:31] almost 170 verses about Zion in the
[40:34] Bible.
[40:35] It also means the entire people of
[40:37] Israel. So it means the city, the whole
[40:39] people, the nation. It's also it can
[40:41] mean a combination of Mariah and Zion.
[40:44] And it could also mean the New Testament
[40:46] kingdom of God, his church, and the
[40:48] future home. That's what we are at right
[40:50] now. Church, we are worshiping right now
[40:53] at spiritual Zion. In other words, your
[40:55] prayers don't come to here. This is a
[40:57] this is not a lofty mountain because I
[41:00] can look down on that. Our prayers go so
[41:02] high God has to look down on it.
[41:05] Hallelujah. Up to the throne of God.
[41:07] Jesus hears your prayers. Hallelujah.
[41:10] They go up to a lofty place. They go up
[41:13] to heaven itself in the presence of God
[41:15] Almighty.
[41:18] Now, here, this is to help you out, too,
[41:19] because I've forgotten these over the
[41:20] last few
[41:21] years. Mount of Olives, that's where
[41:23] Jesus went out to pray before he got
[41:25] arrested.
[41:26] Right now, Jesus was crucified on Gatha.
[41:29] He had to be, this is where the temple
[41:30] of Herod was, uh, where they whipped him
[41:32] and everything, but they had to take him
[41:33] outside the gate, outside the city to
[41:36] crucify him. But he was still crucified
[41:38] in
[41:39] Jerusalem. So, this is Mariah. This is
[41:41] where Abraham, this currently where that
[41:43] filthy Dome of the Rock is. It's a
[41:45] filthy shrine to a false
[41:47] god. Mount Mariah, though, is where the
[41:49] city of David was. Solomon's temple,
[41:51] Abraham and Isaac, all right there. And
[41:53] look, Jesus died right next to it. He He
[41:56] was showing something. He said, "This is
[41:58] my land. This is the beauty of the whole
[42:00] earth. This is God's country. They say
[42:03] Alabama's God's country. No, sir.
[42:05] Jerusalem is God's country. Hallelujah.
[42:08] Because this is where this the the blood
[42:10] was shed. Hallelujah. Now, this is
[42:13] Mariah. This is Mount Zion. Now, does
[42:15] that help her trigger your memory a
[42:16] little bit by God's
[42:18] grace? Now, the elevation Zion is
[42:21] actually higher elevated. It's uh 100
[42:24] feet taller than Mount Mariah. Mount of
[42:26] ours is actually a little taller. And
[42:28] that's where Jesus comes and he fills
[42:29] the Holy Ghost 144,000 with the Holy
[42:31] Ghost on Mount Olives right there.
[42:35] Hallelujah. But this is where the Bible
[42:37] says it's lofty Mount Zion lot. So see
[42:41] see how exalted it is. And this is a
[42:43] type uh and yeah we'll get to that here
[42:45] at the end here by God's grace. Now
[42:48] that's the north and south. See this is
[42:49] north and south view. This is Mariah. So
[42:51] this is where uh Solomon's temple was.
[42:53] Dome of the rock is currently there.
[42:54] Abraham and Isaac right there. Now, the
[42:56] other mountain next to it on the west
[42:58] was Mount Zion. Now, if you turn it,
[43:01] here's the Dome of the Rock. Everybody
[43:02] see the Dome of the Rock? That's that
[43:03] Muslim
[43:05] shrine. Okay? Then you got the valley
[43:07] right here. And then you got this part
[43:08] right here, Mount Zion down here. Now,
[43:11] Caiaphas's house right down here. That's
[43:12] going to become important later by God's
[43:14] grace. Hallelujah. And that means Jesus
[43:17] would have been crucified right around
[43:18] in here. Somewhere right in here. Now,
[43:20] people have different ideas, but he was
[43:22] outside the gate. He was outside the
[43:23] city. All right. Now, when Moses got the
[43:28] law, that foreshadowed the day of
[43:32] Pentecost. Right now, Exodus 12 says
[43:36] that they left Egypt the day after the
[43:38] Passover. The Bible said they left at
[43:39] night. That's why they had to have their
[43:41] belt tied, their loins girded. That's
[43:43] why they had to have all the leaven out
[43:45] of their house. They had to leave with
[43:46] haste. And church, that's how you got to
[43:48] leave your sin. Get out of your sin.
[43:52] Don't play around with sin. Get out of
[43:53] it. Praise God. Amen. As soon as you get
[43:56] ready, as soon as soon as you're aware
[43:57] of it, get out of it, prodigal.
[43:59] Hallelujah.
[44:00] Get out of it, Joseph. Hallelujah. As we
[44:02] said, they left that night because
[44:05] remember, nighttime was a new day. So,
[44:07] they actually left the day after
[44:09] Passover because their days ended when
[44:11] the sun went down. Oh, end of that date.
[44:13] Now, it's a new
[44:14] day. Exodus 19:1 says they arrived at Si
[44:18] in the third month, right? Third month,
[44:20] Pentecost.
[44:21] Then Jewish history says the law
[44:24] arrived. Moses brought the law down on
[44:26] the 50th
[44:27] day. So Moses brought the tables on the
[44:30] 50th
[44:31] day. Is your is your spiritual mind
[44:34] moving now? The gears moving. I'm going
[44:36] to write the I'm going to write the word
[44:38] not on tables of stone, but on
[44:39] what? Uh now you got it. Now you got 2
[44:43] Corinthians 3. You got it. I'm not going
[44:45] to write it on tables of stone anymore.
[44:46] It's also in Ezekiel. I'm not going to
[44:48] write it on stone anymore. What good is
[44:50] what good is it if God writes his
[44:51] commandments? Don't wear makeup. Don't
[44:53] cut your hair. Don't lust. Don't steal.
[44:56] What What does it matter if it's here?
[44:58] God don't want it here. God wants it
[45:00] here. Hallelujah.
[45:02] That's what's going to make a
[45:03] difference. Praise God. If it's written
[45:05] on the fleshly tables of our hearts.
[45:07] Hallelujah.
[45:09] Glory. That's what he's trying to say.
[45:12] He's trying to say that we have hearts
[45:13] of stone. That we can't obey the word of
[45:15] God. The only way we can obey it is if
[45:17] we have a tender heart towards the word
[45:19] of God. A soft
[45:20] heart. An the Bible calls it an honest
[45:23] and good heart. Church, just be honest
[45:26] with God. Just tell God where you fail.
[45:28] Tell tell God where you struggle. That's
[45:30] the spirit of judgment. And then the
[45:31] spirit of burning will give you a fresh
[45:33] anointing
[45:34] and you'll be ready to chase that devil
[45:36] out of your life because you don't want
[45:38] to worship Satan. You don't want to love
[45:40] Satan. You want to love Jesus Christ
[45:42] because he died for your sins. He
[45:44] created the world. The Bible said God
[45:46] created all things by Jesus Christ.
[45:49] Glory. Hope I got some voice left over
[45:51] for the evening service. Now, I just
[45:54] want to point that out to you again. The
[45:55] third month. See how it's the third
[45:56] month? That's when Pentecost was. I just
[45:58] did that little uh
[46:00] triangle. Now, I'm going to go through
[46:01] this quickly. This is just a symbol. So,
[46:03] this is Sinai where the law came to
[46:05] Moses. But look how the New Testament is
[46:07] greater. That was Sinai was a great
[46:10] mountain. But spiritually, our mountain
[46:12] is higher. Our mountain is heavenly.
[46:15] It's lofty.
[46:17] Zion went out this morning. I said I
[46:19] said uh I said, "Zion, your name means
[46:21] lofty." He's like, "Let me go ask the
[46:22] guys if they know what Zion means." Did
[46:25] they know Zion? Did they? Did you ask
[46:27] them? No, they didn't know. Okay. I
[46:29] didn't know either. I had to go look it
[46:30] up, too. I forgot the one thing I
[46:31] forgot. And remember, we're The Bible
[46:34] says in Hebrews 12, we're we are come to
[46:36] Mount
[46:37] Zion just as Israel arrived at Si, which
[46:40] represents we're living in the presence
[46:42] of God. Oh my. God's presence is here,
[46:45] church. If we just open our eyes and let
[46:48] the spirit of judgment come on us, then
[46:50] the spirit of burning will come upon us
[46:52] as well.
[46:54] Zion is the same as the city of the
[46:56] living God, as it says in the Old
[46:57] Testament, the heavenly Jerusalem. You
[46:59] we have the complete angelic host,
[47:02] right? Like God opened the eyes of of
[47:04] Elijah's servant, Gahesa, and he saw
[47:07] there was heavenly hosts all
[47:09] around. Anybody been protected of a car
[47:11] accident ever? That was the angels of
[47:13] God that protected you. Amen.
[47:15] Hallelujah. Like I told you, I I passed
[47:18] out one time and I woke up in the I said
[47:19] I said that on Wednesday and I woke up
[47:21] in the perfect sleeping
[47:22] position. How did that happen? No
[47:24] bruises or nothing. How did that happen?
[47:27] My grandpa, like I told you last week,
[47:29] was driving and the the 18-wheer was
[47:32] coming right at him. He said, "Jesus."
[47:33] And he woke up and I forgot to say this,
[47:35] the car was in park.
[47:38] So sometime somehow he swerved or either
[47:40] God just vanished him like Philillip
[47:42] vanished him and my grandmother and
[47:44] they're on the side of the road. He
[47:45] wakes up the car's in park. The cars
[47:47] off. The car was off too. Now I'm
[47:49] remembering. And he wakes up and says,
[47:50] "What happened? Jesus just saved our
[47:52] lives."
[47:54] Hallelujah. All things are possible to
[47:57] them that believe.
[48:00] See, angels gave him a little transport
[48:03] there. That's right.
[48:07] Zion represents the entire body of born
[48:08] again believers to God and Jesus as the
[48:11] mediator on this mountain. We must
[48:14] accept and not refuse God who's speaking
[48:16] to us from heaven. Sound like that woman
[48:18] in Proverbs 1. She said if you accept me
[48:22] then I'll pour out my spirit. If not the
[48:23] Bible say she said I'll refuse your
[48:26] prayers. Let's let's go back to Proverbs
[48:28] 1. Actually I'm already
[48:31] there. Look at verse 24. Because I've
[48:33] called and you refused. I have stretched
[48:35] out my hand and no man regardeth, but ye
[48:37] have set up not all my counsel. See,
[48:39] they don't want the Holy Ghost. They
[48:40] don't want the word of God. They don't
[48:42] want to obey the word of God. So, what
[48:43] does she say? You wouldn't take any of
[48:45] my reproof. Verse 26, I will also laugh
[48:47] at your calamity. I will mock when your
[48:49] fear cometh. Think about during the
[48:51] tribulation period, all these foolish
[48:53] virgins will be crying out to God. God
[48:55] won't hear none of
[48:56] it because they failed to accept the
[48:59] wisdom that was crying in the streets.
[49:01] They called that brother random move or
[49:03] that holiness move. They called a bunch
[49:04] of fanatics. They said the pillar of
[49:06] fire of Brother Ram's head was the
[49:08] devil. Shame on these
[49:10] people. They're blast. Some of them
[49:12] could be blaspheming the Holy Ghost.
[49:15] And church, we can even show them in the
[49:16] Bible about water baptism and makeup and
[49:19] women's hair and not exposing your
[49:21] thighs and all these things. We can show
[49:22] that in the Bible and they wouldn't take
[49:24] it. So God won't hear their prayers
[49:26] during the tribulation period, but God
[49:28] will hear yours now.
[49:31] Hallelujah. Amen.
[49:35] The woman's going to laugh. The Holy
[49:36] Spirit's going to laugh. It's going to
[49:37] mock at their fear. Verse 27, "When your
[49:40] fear cometh as desolation, and your
[49:42] destruction cometh as a whirlwind, when
[49:44] distress and anguish cometh upon you,
[49:45] then shall they call me, but I will not
[49:47] answer." This is a time God is not going
[49:49] to
[49:50] answer. They shall seek me early, but
[49:52] they shall not find
[49:54] me. For that they hated knowledge and
[49:56] did not choose the fear of the Lord.
[49:59] See, you've got to make a choice today.
[50:01] Am I going to fear God or am I going to
[50:03] love the pleasures of the
[50:05] world? Let's choose Jesus
[50:07] Christ.
[50:09] Hallelujah. Look at verse 31. Therefore,
[50:12] they shall eat the fruit of their own
[50:13] way. Right? The Bible calls it fruit of
[50:16] adultery. Fruit of lies. Right? Any sin,
[50:20] any sin that you that people commit is
[50:22] the fruit of the seed that started the
[50:25] seed of lies that went into their
[50:27] mind. Right?
[50:30] It starts as a thought and then it turns
[50:31] into a word. Then it becomes an action
[50:33] and then they got to eat the fruit, the
[50:35] evil fruit of their
[50:38] decisions. They're going to be filled
[50:40] with their own devices. Think about how
[50:42] they're filled with filled with their
[50:43] own uh laptop devices and their tablet
[50:46] and uh iPhone devices that lead them
[50:48] into
[50:49] sin. They're going to be filled with
[50:51] their own
[50:53] devices. Verse 33. But who so hearken
[50:55] unto me, church, let's hear the Holy
[50:57] Ghost today.
[50:59] shall dwell safely and shall be quiet
[51:01] from the fear of
[51:03] evil.
[51:07] Hallelujah. Now, there's a verse I was
[51:09] just looking for. I thought I read it
[51:15] yesterday where it said life to the soul
[51:18] in chapter
[51:21] 2. Why can't I find it? The time I want
[51:23] to find it.
[51:26] Maybe just give me a second here. While
[51:28] you're there, let's let's move on here.
[51:29] Tell how many remember this visual by
[51:31] God's
[51:32] grace. I'm going to bring that back. But
[51:34] I just want to show that Proverbs real
[51:35] quick. Life to the
[51:41] soul. I cannot find it. Okay. Proverbs
[51:46] 3:22. Okay. Sorry.
[51:49] 3:22. Oh my goodness. I read right over
[51:52] ah it's the beginning. I was looking for
[51:53] the end of the verse. I was looking at
[51:54] the B part of the verse. It's in the A
[51:56] part of the verse. 3:22. So shall they
[51:59] be life unto thy soul and grace unto thy
[52:02] neck. See, when you keep the word of God
[52:04] and you do the word of God, like Jesus
[52:06] said, when you do the truth, you get
[52:08] life into your soul. So the more you
[52:11] obey, the more life you get, the more
[52:13] power you get. Hallelujah. The more
[52:15] victory you get. How many believe that?
[52:17] By God's grace. See, when we disobey, it
[52:20] takes us into the darkness. But when we
[52:22] obey, it brings us into the light and
[52:24] gives us life. Jesus said, "My words are
[52:27] spirit and they are life."
[52:30] Hallelujah. Now, we're getting to that
[52:32] middle part where getting a little tired
[52:34] here. So, let me go and try to move on
[52:36] here. So, Mount Si that burned with
[52:38] fire,
[52:40] uh, blackness, darkness, tempest, voice,
[52:42] death to touch was terrible. But here at
[52:44] Mount Zion, we have the city living God,
[52:46] heavenly Jerusalem, innumerable angels,
[52:48] firstborn church. We have the voice of
[52:50] God. God is here and Jesus is our
[52:53] mediator. Church, let me say it like
[52:55] this. You are not alone. The angels of
[52:57] God are with you and Jesus is your
[52:59] mediator to help you. Praise God.
[53:02] At this mountain, the Mount Zion, the
[53:05] lofty heavenly mountain. Hallelujah.
[53:08] They got the law on the 50th day. The
[53:09] Holy Ghost fell on the 50th day. They
[53:11] had the birth of Judaism. We had the
[53:12] birth of Christianity. They had laws on
[53:14] stone. We have laws on hearts. 3,000
[53:16] died in that day. 3,000 were saved on
[53:19] the day of Pentecost. They had the
[53:20] ministry of death. We have the ministry
[53:22] of life. They had a glory that fades.
[53:24] Our glory remains. Hallelujah. Think
[53:26] about this. 2,000 years later, we're
[53:28] still singing about the glory where it
[53:30] says, "I'm so glad I can say I'm one of
[53:32] them." Praise God. We're still singing
[53:35] about the glory of that Pentecostal day.
[53:37] Praise God. The glory doesn't fade. The
[53:41] freedom in Christ, the joy of Christ,
[53:43] the victory of Christ never fades
[53:45] because it it overcomes all the gates of
[53:48] hell. Hallelujah. It overcomes the
[53:50] darkness and it brings you into light.
[53:52] Praise God.
[53:56] Hallelujah. Now, I'm not going to go
[53:58] through that. That
[53:59] That's I didn't even set a timer, but
[54:01] I'm at about an hour here almost. So, so
[54:05] we basically have
[54:06] everything that they didn't have at at
[54:09] the Mount
[54:10] Si. All right. Now, here's the main
[54:12] point I want to get to here. This is
[54:14] what I thought would be fresh and new.
[54:15] It was new to me. It was a blessing to
[54:17] me by the grace of God.
[54:20] Let me check. I also printed off some
[54:21] notes just in case. Maybe I'll save
[54:23] those for Wednesday. Look at all these
[54:24] things I want to preach to you. Look at
[54:26] them. You're just waiting there. Yeah.
[54:28] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[54:28] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Preach. Preach
[54:29] it. I'll get to it by God's grace. But
[54:32] let me just try to bring this down
[54:34] here. Now, did you ever think of this? I
[54:38] I was uh researching and I found this. I
[54:40] was like, "Oh my goodness, how did I
[54:42] miss this?" The Tower of Babel. They
[54:44] were gathered together to defy Almighty
[54:46] God. On Pentecost, they were gathered to
[54:49] obey Almighty God. It's a it's a it's
[54:53] the opposite. So, other words, Pentecost
[54:56] was undoing all that Babel tried to do.
[55:00] Oh, that's just right. Because we got
[55:01] Babel today. We've got the Roman
[55:02] Catholic Church today. But Pentecost
[55:04] will always do the opposite of the Roman
[55:06] Catholic Church. Praise God. Glory.
[55:12] See, they put power in a man. We don't
[55:14] put power in preachers. We put power in
[55:16] Jesus Christ.
[55:18] They they make the like we took
[55:19] communion last week. They make the blood
[55:21] and the bread the literal. We don't put
[55:23] it on the literal. It's a spiritual
[55:25] thing. Hallelujah. They pray to the
[55:28] dead. We only pray to the living Jesus.
[55:31] Hallelujah.
[55:32] I mean, it's all opposite. Praise
[55:35] God. They their preachers can't marry.
[55:37] Our preachers can marry. Praise God. Oh
[55:40] my. It's almost all opposite. At Babel,
[55:42] God confused their language and it
[55:45] brought division. On Pentecost, God
[55:48] caused understanding of their language
[55:50] and brought unity.
[55:52] Now, I don't know if you you saw it, but
[55:54] I was playing it for my kids a couple
[55:55] months ago. Perry Green, brother uh Jose
[55:58] Perry Green said numerous I'm sorry, his
[56:00] first trip, he went on a missionary trip
[56:02] by the leading of the Holy Ghost like
[56:03] brother told him to do. His first trip
[56:05] was down in South America. I'm not not
[56:07] mistaken. And he said he was nervous and
[56:10] he didn't know if God was going to
[56:11] vindicate it, but brother Ram told him
[56:12] to do
[56:13] it. In his first trip, he starts
[56:16] preaching English and all these nations,
[56:18] I forget it was Argentina or Brazil, I
[56:20] forget which one it was, but he was
[56:21] talking in English and everybody
[56:23] understood him in their own language.
[56:26] And he's like, "This is just like
[56:28] Pentecost."
[56:30] And he said he said it even worked,
[56:32] brother Jose, in the prayer line.
[56:35] They would talk to him in Spanish and
[56:37] he'd understand it in English. And then
[56:39] he would talk in English and they'd
[56:41] understand it in Spanish. You cannot
[56:43] stop God. Hallelujah.
[56:46] God don't need your help with language.
[56:48] God don't need my help with English. God
[56:50] don't need my help with anything. God
[56:51] does what he wants. Praise God.
[56:54] God cannot be stopped. Hallelujah.
[56:57] Amen. Glory to God. And even Isuza
[57:01] Street in 1906, even their first
[57:03] missionaries, from what I read and
[57:04] preached to you, even their first
[57:06] missionaries experienced the same thing.
[57:07] They just had to go and then God would
[57:10] help them understand the
[57:13] languages. I love this. In Babel, they
[57:16] declare, they said, "Let us make a
[57:17] name." On the day of Pentecost, Peter
[57:20] said, "There's only one name, brother,
[57:22] and it ain't Father, Son, Holy Ghost
[57:24] either. It's the name of the Lord Jesus
[57:27] Christ. We're gathered for this name.
[57:30] We're not making ourselves a name. We're
[57:32] putting on a name. Hallelujah.
[57:36] Glory to
[57:39] God. At Babel, they were scattered and
[57:42] they were hopeless for any
[57:45] unity. At Pentecost, God then after
[57:48] filling them, God scattered them with a
[57:50] hope and promise for unity.
[57:54] Look at that church. God can send in
[57:55] Dennis McBride from South Carolina, uh,
[57:59] Cadre Dixs from South Carolina, brother
[58:01] Brian Hawkins from from Pennsylvania,
[58:03] and preach the same thing I'm preaching.
[58:06] And we don't even listen to each other.
[58:08] I don't I don't listen to those guys. I
[58:10] can't because Abby knows put it online.
[58:12] Now, I might if I could, but they don't
[58:15] listen to me. I don't listen to them.
[58:16] How can that happen? Because God's
[58:18] spirit is sending the same messages, the
[58:20] same word. Hallelujah. He's uniting us
[58:23] by an invisible power, not by a physical
[58:26] gathering. There will be a physical
[58:28] gathering at the rapture, but right now
[58:30] it's spiritual gathering. Getting unity
[58:32] of the word. God's all helping us
[58:35] understand the same wisdom of God. Amen.
[58:38] And brother Ram said, "The spirit and
[58:40] the bride from Revelation 22 and the
[58:43] prophet will all be saying the same
[58:44] thing, and what they're saying is
[58:47] already in the word." Hallelujah.
[58:50] My glory to God.
[58:52] Hallelujah, brother Jose. It's it's a
[58:54] it's a done deal. It's a sealed deal.
[58:56] I'll be the bride as long as I only
[58:58] preach what's in here. It proves I'm the
[59:00] bride.
[59:01] It's proof, brother, because I'm saying
[59:04] what the spirit says. And this don't say
[59:07] press, play, and obey and sit at home at
[59:09] church and I can be just as good as
[59:10] Christian if I sit home. Brother said,
[59:12] "If you got the Holy Ghost," he said,
[59:13] "you'll want the word more than you want
[59:15] your necessary favorite meal."
[59:18] He said if you got the Holy Ghost, he
[59:19] said it'll drive you to the church every
[59:22] time the doors are open. Praise God.
[59:25] Hallelujah. Praise God. That's what the
[59:27] word says. Jesus's custom was being into
[59:30] the Sabbath every Sabbath day. He never
[59:33] missed church. So God help us to live
[59:36] like Jesus. Amen. Take the word of God
[59:39] and live
[59:41] it. Now, what was Babel? It was a human
[59:44] attempt to make heaven. That's what the
[59:45] Catholic Church is. It's a human attempt
[59:47] to make heaven right now. But what was
[59:50] Pentecost? It was God's divine act for
[59:53] heaven to reach down to humanity.
[59:56] Heaven reaching down, not earth reaching
[59:59] up. Heaven reached down. Oh, it doesn't
[1:00:01] make you want to sing that song. When he
[1:00:03] reached down his hand for me. When he
[1:00:08] reached way down for brother Jess. And
[1:00:12] now put your name in there. I was lost
[1:00:16] and undone. Sing it with me. Without God
[1:00:19] or his son when he reached down his hand
[1:00:25] for me. He reached down. You didn't
[1:00:28] reach up. He reached down to save you.
[1:00:30] Hallelujah. You were sinking like Peter,
[1:00:33] but he lifted you up. Praise God. Amen.
[1:00:36] Hallelujah. Glory. Amen. It's God
[1:00:40] reaching down to man. That's what God
[1:00:42] wants to do today. He wants to reach
[1:00:44] down into the hearts of his people
[1:00:45] today. Amen. Pour out his spirit on his
[1:00:48] people. That's right. They got cursed
[1:00:51] and judged and separated on the day of
[1:00:53] Pentecost. They got nothing but
[1:00:55] blessings. Hallelujah. Now, but then the
[1:00:57] physical persecution came not long after
[1:00:59] that. And know you and I, we might not
[1:01:01] have it yet physical, but we definitely
[1:01:02] got it spiritual. Your family don't like
[1:01:04] you anymore. Friends don't like you. Old
[1:01:06] girlfriend, old boyfriend don't like you
[1:01:07] anymore. Let him go. Praise God. Let him
[1:01:10] go. Praise God. You've got Jesus.
[1:01:12] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You got more
[1:01:14] than a friend, more than a father, more
[1:01:16] than a mother, more than a wife, more
[1:01:18] than a husband. You've got the God of
[1:01:20] the world. You've got the almighty.
[1:01:22] Hallelujah. You got the first and the
[1:01:23] last. You've got the almighty God.
[1:01:26] Hallelujah.
[1:01:28] Amen. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:01:32] You're blessed because Jesus was cursed.
[1:01:37] The Bible said, "Cursed is anyone who
[1:01:39] hangs on a tree." Galatians 3:13.
[1:01:42] He was cursed so that the blessing might
[1:01:44] come upon you. And what's the blessing?
[1:01:47] I'm forgiven all my trespass. I think I
[1:01:50] showed one of the brothers last week.
[1:01:51] You're forgiven all. Everybody say all.
[1:01:52] Ready? All your trespasses. You don't
[1:01:54] have heaven. Don't record no trespasses
[1:01:56] against you because Jesus already paid
[1:01:59] for them.
[1:02:01] Like that man says, if you are in court
[1:02:03] for a speeding fine and let's say it was
[1:02:05] mine, I had to pay one one time. It's
[1:02:06] probably $200. My goodness.
[1:02:09] I've had two speeding tickets since I
[1:02:10] moved out there to Doorstown. Now I
[1:02:12] drive like a little old lady. I don't
[1:02:15] care. I just let him. I said, "Go ahead.
[1:02:17] You can ride me all you want. I'm not
[1:02:19] getting another ticket. I drive like a
[1:02:21] little old woman. Old woman. 100y old
[1:02:24] woman." But but but the Ray Comfort, he
[1:02:26] likens it under this. Like you're at a
[1:02:28] court and you got to I got to pay my
[1:02:30] fine, my $200 for my speeding fine. And
[1:02:33] brother Ray Cover is like Jesus comes in
[1:02:36] and he comes in and pays the fine for
[1:02:39] you. Therefore, you can go free. You
[1:02:41] didn't have to pay anything.
[1:02:43] He paid it. Somebody hearing me today?
[1:02:46] Hallelujah. Your your fine has already
[1:02:49] been paid. You don't have to pay the
[1:02:52] price. Jesus already paid the price.
[1:02:54] Hallelujah. Amen. And now you're free.
[1:02:57] You don't have to pay for it. And so you
[1:02:59] live a life of gratitude. Thank God
[1:03:01] somebody paid my fine. Thank God the
[1:03:03] tickets paid for. Thank God I'm free.
[1:03:05] Thank God I'm no longer before the
[1:03:07] court. Thank God I'm a free man or
[1:03:09] woman. Praise God.
[1:03:11] And it's legal.
[1:03:14] Because he just gave you the money. He
[1:03:16] paid them. He paid the fine. Now the
[1:03:17] fine's paid. Now there's no more fine.
[1:03:20] Amen. There's no more death sentence.
[1:03:23] I'm not going to hell. I'm going to
[1:03:25] heaven. Praise God.
[1:03:28] Hallelujah.
[1:03:30] Glory. I knew today was going to be kind
[1:03:32] of a fired up service. I was looking at
[1:03:34] these quotes. I'm
[1:03:35] going at Babel. Okay, I did that one.
[1:03:38] Oh, yeah. I just forgot. I just Okay.
[1:03:41] Yeah. Human effort at Babel and divine
[1:03:43] effort on Pentecost. They had a failed
[1:03:46] kingdom. And this is a successful I said
[1:03:49] this. A kingdom that cannot be moved.
[1:03:53] That's what the Bible says. Praise God.
[1:03:56] Oh
[1:03:57] my. They were set. They separated the
[1:04:00] nations and the Holy Ghost unites the
[1:04:02] nations
[1:04:03] under Jesus Christ. Look what God's
[1:04:06] doing even in America right now through
[1:04:07] the president and so uniting all these
[1:04:09] nations. Now, I know it's going to have
[1:04:10] a bad outcome, but God can't do it
[1:04:12] through any other nation except a a
[1:04:14] former Christian nation. And the church
[1:04:15] said,
[1:04:17] that's right. We're one of the only
[1:04:18] nations that honors Christ.
[1:04:21] So you see in the natural and I know
[1:04:22] it's a false unity but it's a type right
[1:04:25] of what actually happened at the
[1:04:27] beginning of the nation I'm talking
[1:04:28] about with our founding fathers. They
[1:04:29] were Christians
[1:04:31] and they had all these testimonies. They
[1:04:33] were defeating the British with with
[1:04:35] hardly anything. God fought for them
[1:04:37] because they were a Christian nation.
[1:04:39] Now I'm getting off of that now. Now
[1:04:42] here's a nice visual now. Just it's it's
[1:04:43] the same thing I said but look they had
[1:04:45] confusion. Pentecost had understanding.
[1:04:48] God scattered them and God scattered
[1:04:50] them to spread the gospel. Their
[1:04:53] language uh was make a name for
[1:04:56] themselves and they magnify the name.
[1:04:58] They they declared the wonderful works
[1:05:00] of
[1:05:01] God. They had disunityity. Pentecost
[1:05:04] brought
[1:05:05] unity. Same thing here. It's just a
[1:05:08] different picture. And I love this one.
[1:05:11] They made a name for themselves. And
[1:05:12] Peter said, "We got the name of Jesus
[1:05:14] Christ."
[1:05:16] Church, the word name means authority.
[1:05:19] Let's say authority. Ready?
[1:05:21] If you speak the name of Jesus Christ
[1:05:23] and you confess your sins, you have
[1:05:25] authority over every demon power.
[1:05:28] Hallelujah. I've seen it in operation
[1:05:31] many times. If that person confesses
[1:05:34] their sin, the Holy Ghost will move that
[1:05:38] demon out because it's that word means
[1:05:41] authority. The word name is power and
[1:05:44] authority. Devils cannot stand against
[1:05:47] the name of Jesus Christ. Oh,
[1:05:50] hallelujah. That's right. It's
[1:05:52] impossible because it's one power that's
[1:05:55] greater than the other power.
[1:05:58] Hallelujah. It is the name above all
[1:06:01] names. I'm preaching to you. So, you'll
[1:06:03] use the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:06:05] Hallelujah.
[1:06:06] I'll use it. You'll use it. We'll all
[1:06:08] use it. Praise
[1:06:11] God. Now, this is what was special to
[1:06:13] me. Maybe not to you, but I hope this is
[1:06:16] a blessing. Anybody know where the
[1:06:18] location of the upper room
[1:06:21] was? Location of the upper room was in
[1:06:24] the southwestern corner. Here's uh
[1:06:27] here's
[1:06:28] Mariah. So, here's Mount Zion and this
[1:06:31] is the valley. So, this at the very
[1:06:33] edge, this at the very bottom edge of
[1:06:35] Mount Zion. The Holy Ghost fell on
[1:06:38] natural Mount Zion.
[1:06:41] The Holy Ghost today falls on spiritual
[1:06:45] Mount Zion, the people of God. And the
[1:06:47] church said, "Ain't that awesome, Mount
[1:06:49] Zion? Ain't that awesome? The Holy Ghost
[1:06:52] didn't fall on Mariah. It fell on
[1:06:54] Zion." Because Zion is the name of our
[1:06:58] kingdom.
[1:07:00] It's a lofty kingdom. We don't have a
[1:07:02] weak kingdom. We've got a lofty, high,
[1:07:07] exalted,
[1:07:08] holy,
[1:07:10] magnificent, powerful, glorious kingdom.
[1:07:13] We've got a king who sits at the top and
[1:07:16] he's just waiting to hear from you and
[1:07:18] I. He's just waiting for you to speak
[1:07:21] his name. Hallelujah.
[1:07:24] Glory to
[1:07:25] God. So, the Holy Ghost fell on Mount
[1:07:27] Zion. Naturally, it falls on the bride
[1:07:30] in spiritual Mount Zion, which is the
[1:07:33] kingdom of God. And where did Jesus say
[1:07:35] the kingdom of God is? He said, "It's
[1:07:37] within you." Amen. So, where's it going
[1:07:39] to fall? Right here on Mount Zion.
[1:07:41] Everybody tap your heart, say, "Mount
[1:07:42] Zion." Ready? Mount Zion. That's where
[1:07:43] it's going to fall. Right there. Mount
[1:07:45] Zion. Right there. You are Mount Zion.
[1:07:48] You're You're the temple. How many know
[1:07:50] 1 Corinthians 3, 1 Corinthians 6, you're
[1:07:53] the temple of the temple. You're the
[1:07:54] temple of the Holy Ghost. Sorry, I'm a
[1:07:56] little excited here.
[1:07:58] You're the temple. You're the body.
[1:08:00] You're the temple the Holy Ghost wants
[1:08:02] to fall on. Amen. The temple of the Holy
[1:08:06] Ghost. You're Mount Zion that God wants
[1:08:09] to fall on. Isn't that beautiful? I
[1:08:11] didn't know that till today. I'm like,
[1:08:13] where is the upper room? It's in
[1:08:17] Zion. Hallelujah. Now, I'm going to get
[1:08:20] into my thought maybe for Wednesday.
[1:08:22] Give me five more minutes here. I don't
[1:08:23] have really much more unless God gives
[1:08:25] me some inspiration.
[1:08:27] I don't want to um I don't want to
[1:08:30] cancel that out like that couldn't
[1:08:33] happen. Now, church, as I was thinking
[1:08:35] this morning, as I was finishing this
[1:08:37] sermon, church, there's burning inside
[1:08:39] of everybody here today. Either God's
[1:08:40] spirit or it's the spirit of sin.
[1:08:44] Everybody in here is burning with
[1:08:45] something. And you better be burning
[1:08:47] with the Holy Ghost.
[1:08:50] Hallelujah.
[1:08:52] This just struck me today. I'm like,
[1:08:53] "That's right. There's a false
[1:08:56] fire. There's a evil fire. And then
[1:08:59] there's a good
[1:09:00] fire.
[1:09:02] Hallelujah. Scientists call it uh I
[1:09:04] forget what I have to look on my phone.
[1:09:06] But scientists have they they recognize
[1:09:08] there's two kinds of
[1:09:09] fires. Let me see if I can pull that up
[1:09:11] real
[1:09:11] quick. I don't think it it I don't think
[1:09:14] it loaded. But there's two kinds of
[1:09:15] fires. I'll just uh there's like fires
[1:09:17] that be contained and then there's these
[1:09:20] wild destruction fires, right? So
[1:09:23] destruction fire is like what happened
[1:09:24] to LA and it deserved it. It was
[1:09:27] probably set off so they could, you
[1:09:29] know, so the big brother can buy all the
[1:09:31] land and, you know, it's probably set
[1:09:32] off by man. Most things are, I
[1:09:35] guess, but that's like a destruction
[1:09:38] fire. But then there's what's called
[1:09:40] contained fires, like
[1:09:42] campfires, right? Like a backyard fire.
[1:09:46] There's two kinds of fires. Hallelujah.
[1:09:49] Now, church, what do we need? We need a
[1:09:51] contained fire that stays contained in
[1:09:53] our soul.
[1:09:55] Hallelujah. We don't want the fire of
[1:09:57] destruction that burns up our lives and
[1:10:01] puts us in a place of darkness and fear
[1:10:04] uh where we feel loss and and um
[1:10:06] incapable of being saved,
[1:10:09] hopeless, where the fire just consumes
[1:10:11] all of our lives and and we can never
[1:10:13] get out and we feel like we're we're
[1:10:15] going to lose it all. We don't want that
[1:10:17] kind of destruction fire. We've got to
[1:10:19] put out that fire. And we need to have a
[1:10:22] contained fire. A fire that's contained
[1:10:24] in our soul. Hallelujah. A fire that we
[1:10:27] keep burning. It's a spirit of burning.
[1:10:30] Hallelujah. That's what we need. We
[1:10:31] don't want to be destroyed with fire,
[1:10:33] but we want fire contained in our
[1:10:35] vessels. Hallelujah.
[1:10:37] We want fire to fall on Mount
[1:10:41] Zion. That's
[1:10:44] right. So, look at Romans. This is what
[1:10:46] struck me. I just started searching the
[1:10:47] New Testament for the word burn. What
[1:10:49] the homosexuals have? They burn in their
[1:10:52] lust one toward another. And then
[1:10:54] remember 1 Corinthians 7 says, "It's
[1:10:56] better to marry than to Ah, you good
[1:10:59] good Bible readers out there."
[1:11:01] Hallelujah. Yeah. It's better to marry
[1:11:03] than to be burned with a destruction
[1:11:05] fire.
[1:11:06] Hallelujah. So, see, everybody's burning
[1:11:08] with something here today. What you need
[1:11:10] to do is get the Holy Ghost. Get it
[1:11:13] active in your life. Start speaking the
[1:11:14] word. Believe in the word. It'll bring
[1:11:16] you life. It's like water to put out the
[1:11:18] fire. I'm talking about the destruction
[1:11:19] fire.
[1:11:21] Hallelujah. It water to put out the
[1:11:24] fire. That's right, church. See,
[1:11:28] homosexuals have this burning. But what
[1:11:30] does the Bible say? Paul said, "Some of
[1:11:33] you were uh abuser of yourself with
[1:11:35] mankind. Some of you had this fire, but
[1:11:38] then something happened. The Holy Spirit
[1:11:40] came upon you. The spirit of God washed
[1:11:43] you from that fire.
[1:11:45] The word of God put out the
[1:11:47] fire. The word of God sanctified you.
[1:11:50] The word of God justified you. The
[1:11:52] spirit of judgment. And the church said,
[1:11:54] "All you have to do is recognize, I've
[1:11:56] got a sinful fire." That's the spirit of
[1:11:58] judgment. The spirit of God's anointing
[1:12:00] you. I've got a sinful fire. And then
[1:12:02] God will send his spirit of burning. In
[1:12:04] this case, it's the it's a type of the
[1:12:05] water, the rushing waters, the living
[1:12:07] waters of the word. It'll put out that
[1:12:10] destructive fire. And it'll give you the
[1:12:11] fire of God. Hallelujah.
[1:12:14] That's right. How does it come, church?
[1:12:17] In the name of the Father and Holy
[1:12:18] Ghost. In the name of Brother Jesse? In
[1:12:20] the name of Bride of Christ Fellowship?
[1:12:21] In the name of William Brandham? No, it
[1:12:22] comes in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:12:24] Hallelujah.
[1:12:27] Hallelujah.
[1:12:28] It's not a man's name, a woman's name.
[1:12:31] It's God's name, the name above all
[1:12:32] names. Jesus
[1:12:35] Christ. Can everybody see that?
[1:12:38] Think about all I'm going to go through
[1:12:40] that. Maybe I'll preach a part nine
[1:12:41] here. by God's
[1:12:42] grace. Let's close with
[1:12:46] that. Jesus, God said in the Old
[1:12:48] Testament, remember the daughters of
[1:12:50] Zion, they had high heels on. They were
[1:12:51] tinkling as they go. They had 21
[1:12:53] different kinds of accessories. They
[1:12:55] just had accessories everywhere. You
[1:12:56] know, they had accessories all around.
[1:12:58] They had accessories everywhere. And God
[1:13:00] said, "I'm going to burn them with the
[1:13:02] spirit of judgment and the spirit of
[1:13:03] burning. And they're going to go off
[1:13:04] into the
[1:13:06] millennium." Hallelujah.
[1:13:09] Now notice, and the Lord will create. So
[1:13:12] after this, look at this. After God
[1:13:14] gives a spirit of judgment where you can
[1:13:15] judge yourself sinful, then God sends a
[1:13:17] spirit of burning. And then what does he
[1:13:19] do? He creates a clean heart. He creates
[1:13:22] a brand new life. You don't have to live
[1:13:25] like you were living. You can have a
[1:13:27] brand new life. I'm a witness. How many
[1:13:30] witnesses we have out there? Jesus
[1:13:32] creates a new life in our lives. That
[1:13:35] That's the
[1:13:36] order. judgment, burning, new creation.
[1:13:41] That's what the Bible says. We are new
[1:13:43] creatures. Behold, all things become
[1:13:45] new. Let's say all things. Ready? All
[1:13:47] things can become new. Hallelujah. And
[1:13:51] then the Holy Ghost. We are the temple.
[1:13:53] We're the mountain. We're the Zion that
[1:13:55] God wants to come in and fall upon and
[1:13:59] fill. And this is what I love. Isaiah
[1:14:01] first had to acknowledge his sin. He
[1:14:04] says, "Woe is
[1:14:05] me. I am
[1:14:08] undone. I'm a man of unclean lips. And I
[1:14:10] dwell in the midst of people of unclean
[1:14:12] lips. For mine eyes have seen the king,
[1:14:14] the Lord of hosts. See, that's the
[1:14:16] spirit of judgment. See, there's the
[1:14:18] king. He's seen the king. He see he's in
[1:14:20] the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit says,
[1:14:22] "I'm
[1:14:23] unclean." And church, that's what God
[1:14:25] wants you to say. God wants each one of
[1:14:26] us to say, "I am guilty of sin. It's my
[1:14:29] fault. It's my lust. It's my sin. It's
[1:14:32] my craving for anything that's
[1:14:34] forbidden.
[1:14:36] It's my fault. I'm unclean. I'm undone.
[1:14:39] I can't fix myself. I need someone to
[1:14:41] wash me. Hallelujah.
[1:14:44] That's what it
[1:14:45] is. So the Lord of hosts sends the
[1:14:47] seraraphim. Bring the coal. The live co.
[1:14:49] I like that. The live word. The living
[1:14:51] word. Hallelujah. Bring the living fire.
[1:14:54] It's a living fire. And he lays it on
[1:14:56] his mouth and he touches his lips and he
[1:14:59] says, "Ah, I feel forgiven." See,
[1:15:01] church, that's that's what let me say
[1:15:02] like this. You got to pray until you
[1:15:04] feel
[1:15:06] forgiven. You have to feel that you are
[1:15:08] forgiven,
[1:15:10] church. Because that's what happened to
[1:15:12] him. That's why Peter could rejoice on
[1:15:15] the day of Pentecost. He didn't feel the
[1:15:17] guilt and shame anymore because he knew
[1:15:19] he was forgiven.
[1:15:21] Think about that. He denied Christ three
[1:15:24] times. He ran away and abandoned his
[1:15:29] lord like a sheep run like a little
[1:15:32] sheep running away from the shepherd. He
[1:15:34] abandoned his own shepherd but yet he
[1:15:36] was able to be feel forgiven enough to
[1:15:38] let the Holy Ghost come on and then
[1:15:40] start speaking for Jesus.
[1:15:43] Because he was able to admit he was a
[1:15:45] sinner and needed the grace of God. See
[1:15:48] how important it is? That's why I tell
[1:15:50] people, I've told numerous people, if if
[1:15:53] you if you need victory, just lay at the
[1:15:55] altar, tell God what a sinner you are,
[1:15:57] and ask God to send the Holy Ghost.
[1:15:59] Amen. Say, "I don't want to live like
[1:16:01] this anymore. I don't want to act like
[1:16:03] this anymore. I want to be changed. I
[1:16:05] recognize I'm a sinner. Your spirit's on
[1:16:07] me. Now send your fire and give me a
[1:16:09] burning experience. Give me a cleansing
[1:16:11] experience." See, we got to love
[1:16:13] righteousness more than we love sin.
[1:16:15] Hallelujah.
[1:16:17] That's right.
[1:16:19] What did he say? My iniquity is taken
[1:16:22] away. I feel
[1:16:25] forgiven. Jesus has dropped the
[1:16:28] charges. And the church said,
[1:16:32] "I feel I feel forgiven today, church."
[1:16:34] Why? Because I asked God to forgive me.
[1:16:36] Hallelujah. All you have to do is
[1:16:38] confess. Lord, I'm guilty. Forgive me.
[1:16:40] I'm unclean. Send your Holy Spirit. Make
[1:16:42] me feel forgiven. God has to send it if
[1:16:45] you really mean it. Now, he knows if
[1:16:47] you're going to go back out tonight and
[1:16:48] just do the same old thing. You got to
[1:16:51] really mean it. Praise God. And then God
[1:16:53] sends the fire. And then you feel the
[1:16:55] forgiveness. And then your mind is
[1:16:57] consumed. You have a you're a new
[1:16:59] creation. You have a transformed mind.
[1:17:01] And now the word of God is your life.
[1:17:05] He gives your soul
[1:17:08] life. Hallelujah.
[1:17:13] Church, the day of Pentecost, I forgot.
[1:17:15] I forgot I had these quotes here.
[1:17:18] In this sermon, Invisible Union, you
[1:17:20] probably remember it. It was around
[1:17:22] Thanksgiving
[1:17:23] 65. That's that's the quote brother
[1:17:25] said, "I'm more thankful for God's
[1:17:27] forgiveness than anything else I know
[1:17:28] of." A month before he died, he was more
[1:17:31] thankful to be
[1:17:32] forgiven. He was showing how modern
[1:17:34] women don't want children. Even in the
[1:17:36] 60s, they didn't want children. Look at
[1:17:38] them now. The cat ladies, they want cats
[1:17:41] and dogs and birds, whatever. They don't
[1:17:45] want babies, human babies. They want
[1:17:47] animals. You know why? Because they're
[1:17:48] beasts themselves. Look at their hair.
[1:17:51] Look at their faces. Look at their
[1:17:52] violence that they have. They're literal
[1:17:54] uh they're filled with beasts. They're
[1:17:55] literal serpent seed. I'm talking about
[1:17:58] the majority of them. Because few there
[1:18:00] be that find the narrow road. Some can
[1:18:01] get saved. Thank God. We want to pray
[1:18:02] for them and we'll keep preaching so
[1:18:04] they can get saved. The few. And brother
[1:18:07] saying they'd rather have pets than be a
[1:18:09] real mother to children, human children.
[1:18:13] Brother said, "What a picture of the
[1:18:15] modern church today." Neither does the
[1:18:16] modern church want any of these
[1:18:17] screaming, shouting, tongues speaking
[1:18:19] Acts 2:38, youngans around her. See, the
[1:18:23] the the the church now, the
[1:18:24] denominations, they don't want a Mount
[1:18:26] Zion
[1:18:27] experience. They want to take that away
[1:18:29] and just make it a classical demon
[1:18:32] religion, right? Because brother said,
[1:18:34] "Thus say the Lord, classical religion
[1:18:35] is of the devil." You and I need to
[1:18:38] experience where we scream or shout,
[1:18:40] speak in tongues, do something. Yeah.
[1:18:42] She don't want any of them whooping.
[1:18:45] Whoop.
[1:18:47] Whoop. Whoop. Glory. Whoop. Hallelujah.
[1:18:50] Jesus is alive. Amen. Sorry, brother.
[1:18:52] I'm stepping on I'm already stepping on
[1:18:53] toes. Amen. Hopefully my sermon was
[1:18:54] stepping on sinful toes, too. But
[1:18:57] they're just whooping around. Praise
[1:18:58] God. Glory to God. Giving God glory. But
[1:19:01] the church don't want that. Immediately
[1:19:03] they say, "Get out of our
[1:19:07] church." They'd throw it out real quick.
[1:19:10] Why you letting such stuff as this go
[1:19:12] along? Brother Ram said, "See, the
[1:19:14] denominations are pregnantated with
[1:19:16] something. They're bringing forth dead
[1:19:17] church members all the time."
[1:19:20] She don't want none of them screaming,
[1:19:22] hollering, blabbering, Acts 2:38,
[1:19:24] miserable creatures that she thinks they
[1:19:26] are. It would certainly embarrass her.
[1:19:29] It doesn't embarrass me when somebody
[1:19:31] says, "Hallelujah."
[1:19:33] It doesn't embarrass me when someone
[1:19:35] said, "Preach it, brother."
[1:19:38] Hallelujah. That doesn't embarrass me.
[1:19:40] If somebody screams or comes down here
[1:19:41] at the altar and throws their hands up
[1:19:43] and screams, that doesn't offend me.
[1:19:45] That actually makes me feel pretty
[1:19:46] welcome. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:19:49] Hallelujah.
[1:19:52] And this is the only kind that God can
[1:19:55] produce. It's the only kind of children
[1:19:56] God ever burst
[1:19:58] forth. It would ruin her and her
[1:20:01] educated, ethical, scientific society
[1:20:03] church that they belong to there. They
[1:20:05] would throw her out at the next council.
[1:20:07] Well, we do the opposite. If you act
[1:20:08] like that, we keep you in.
[1:20:11] It's only when you misbehave, we'll put
[1:20:12] you
[1:20:13] out. That's the
[1:20:16] truth. She They would They'd have her
[1:20:19] out. She can't have it. So, she don't
[1:20:20] want to be pregnant with the word
[1:20:22] because that's the only kind that the
[1:20:25] word can bring forth.
[1:20:27] The Holy Ghost will only produce some
[1:20:30] type of experience where you scream or
[1:20:31] woo or holler or give God glory and you
[1:20:34] feel like you've got new life. You've
[1:20:36] come to the mountain. You're God's
[1:20:38] written his word upon the fleshly tables
[1:20:40] of your heart and your soul has life.
[1:20:44] It's the only kind the Holy Ghost can
[1:20:46] bring
[1:20:48] forth. Is that my last one? Okay, I got
[1:20:51] two more quotes. Oh, I got two more. We
[1:20:53] are at the end. Let's stand. We're at
[1:20:54] the end. Musicians can come. We finally
[1:20:57] reached the end. Some of you are
[1:20:59] wondering, are we going to get to the
[1:21:02] end? We have made it to the end. Listen
[1:21:06] to this church. Born of the spirit of
[1:21:08] God. It has the spirit of God in it. How
[1:21:11] do you know? Because it obeys the word
[1:21:13] of
[1:21:14] God. No intellectual creed join creed
[1:21:17] going bobbed hair painted face. There's
[1:21:19] no such a thing as all of that. In all
[1:21:22] of it. You don't find that in the word
[1:21:24] of God. You find an oldfashioned
[1:21:26] sanctified Holy Ghostfilled child born
[1:21:28] of the spirit of God screaming,
[1:21:30] hollering, shouting, praising God.
[1:21:35] This is what the spirit of burning
[1:21:37] produces. It produces someone that will
[1:21:39] praise God no matter who's around. You
[1:21:41] know why they forget about who's around?
[1:21:42] Because they're in the presence of
[1:21:43] somebody greater than you and I. They're
[1:21:46] in the presence of Jesus
[1:21:47] Christ.
[1:21:52] Hallelujah. Last
[1:21:54] quote. And another thing, notice what
[1:21:56] kind of children she's bearing. The
[1:21:58] denominations that tells what their pop
[1:22:00] is whether it's the first Adam or the
[1:22:02] second. first Adam will bring forth
[1:22:03] denominations, right? He brought forth
[1:22:05] death, he said. But the second Adam, if
[1:22:08] the church brings forth a child of the
[1:22:09] second Adam, he acts the second Adam's
[1:22:12] way of acting like they did when? On the
[1:22:15] day of
[1:22:16] Pentecost, that's the only way a child
[1:22:19] acts when it's
[1:22:20] born. That's really true. Second Adam's
[1:22:24] children. See, their nature is like his
[1:22:26] and hers. Yes, sir. Her daughters,
[1:22:28] painted face, bobbed hair, wearing men's
[1:22:29] clothes, trousers. The Bible said for
[1:22:31] her not to do it. She cuts her hair.
[1:22:32] It's a shamed her. You say, "Shut up on
[1:22:34] that. That's what the word says." I'm
[1:22:38] only pointing out nature. That's what
[1:22:41] she does. Hallelujah. How many want that
[1:22:43] to be your testimony? This is my nature.
[1:22:45] This is what I do. Let's bow our heads
[1:22:48] here.
[1:22:50] Hallelujah. The spirit of burning.
[1:22:53] That's how it burns, church. That's how
[1:22:55] it burned on the day of Pentecost.
[1:22:57] That's how it burns all the time. by the
[1:23:00] grace of
[1:23:01] God.
[1:23:03] Hallelujah. Play that song. Holy Spirit,
[1:23:06] thou art welcome in this
[1:23:11] place. Holy
[1:23:14] Spirit, thou art
[1:23:18] well. Come
[1:23:21] in this place.
[1:23:25] Holy
[1:23:27] Spirit, thou art
[1:23:31] welcome
[1:23:33] in this
[1:23:37] [Music]
[1:23:39] place.
[1:23:41] Father of
[1:23:44] mercy and
[1:23:46] grace, thou art
[1:23:50] [Music]
[1:23:51] well. Just keep playing that. Now, this
[1:23:55] is usually a song people sing at the
[1:23:56] beginning, right? I believe the Holy
[1:23:59] Ghost has been here the whole
[1:24:01] service, but we really want the Holy
[1:24:03] Ghost to show up
[1:24:05] now. Praise God. How will it act? Well,
[1:24:08] if you got sin in your life, it'll say,
[1:24:10] "I'm guilty. Lord, forgive me of sin."
[1:24:13] And then the Holy Ghost will come upon
[1:24:15] you and clean out your life. It'll give
[1:24:18] you one of those anointings. anointing
[1:24:20] of burning, anointing of dissolving
[1:24:22] doubts, anointing to help you not quit
[1:24:24] and keep going on the Christian life or
[1:24:26] it'll give you a Holy Ghost to put you
[1:24:28] into service to Jesus Christ. That's
[1:24:31] what it
[1:24:32] does. And that's the only thing it can
[1:24:35] do because that's the only thing the
[1:24:36] word can produce. Everyone understand?
