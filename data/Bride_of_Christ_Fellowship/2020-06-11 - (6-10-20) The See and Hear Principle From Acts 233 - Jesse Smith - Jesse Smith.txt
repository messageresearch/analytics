better job on that and so musicians if you'd like to take a seat you can thank you went out nice to hear cam and brother Brooks say what what an improvement they've heard and though in the worship

coming off of special meetings I'm just happy to be in the house of Lord you mean to the Holy Spirit as I told you I was so thankful that's nice I think Oh grace verses but every every group of meetings has a highlight service and so I think that was the highlight for us just to see that great move of the Holy Spirit everybody yielding was such a wonderful thing I was so blessed by that and I think the Lord for a church that can yield like that I was I was so thankful because Moran says it's clear the atmosphere brings all the results yeah and now but him and I were talking know sometimes the atmosphere has to be after everybody leaves and then atmosphere can fall so it just depends on the time and season yeah I was really good point but I remember that that was an excellent point sometimes you know people are just busy and they need to get out and that's great but then people can stay in and still have that atmosphere that was an excellent point but I appreciate you sharing that so we're thankful whenever a child of God gets blessed we're all blessed amen so we're so thankful for all God has done for us let's take a few bur quests have one announcement we have a

said a praise God let's think our Mama's here tonight by God's grace let go - ass - I want to I just want to do a follow-up sermon on the baptism of the Holy Ghost we had just a wonderful prayer on Saturday night I kind of want to just go through the scriptures as I was mentioning I appreciated you know cam and brother Brooks they really labored in prayer for those people up here and I appreciate the children as they they stood up here with their hands if they were telling me they were they enjoyed every moment my check we didn't want Brooks to stop talking and didn't want canvas top preach amen now that was a great testimony and and so I want to just go over that again and share some more things from the scripture cam had mentioned that you know he learned through my preaching I'm not propping up myself but from Maya preaching now everybody has to see in here when something happens to a Christian yes and that's from the Bible so I want to go over that tonight I'm gonna call this the scene here principle from Acts - I believe it's is it 23 or 32 33 okay yeah thank you I want to look at tonight I believe it'll be a help to you would be a blessing acts 233 thanks maokai Lydia for that if you've ever seen a baby born naturally I'm not naturally you can always see it and hear it right yeah anytime a natural baby is born I've seen seven of them bore one more Lord willing a couple months here you can always see it being born cuz it emerges right and then you can hear it that is born and so brother Branham always uses that same principle to the baptism with the Holy Ghost which is Scripture yes let's read this together and then we'll read our memory verse brother amen well you have to forgive me I forgot where we where was your memory verse from yeah okay yeah that's right five right yeah I'm sorry 514 223 anything yeah I'm sorry just sublime I you know we didn't do it all weekend so forget it let's read this together because this is just one scripture then we'll read our memory verse on three one two three therefore being by the right hand of God exalted and having received of the fáák trunks of the Holy Ghost he had shed forth this which he now see and here so wasn't walking up like my man he makes the joke all the time he said it wasn't walking up to the priest and getting a wafer in your mouth and you know putting up ashes on your forehead yeah like a late night it wasn't that it was an actual experience with God amen like they they had so they were filled with God that they acted and expressed something amen and people saw it it was it was so real that caused them to somehow respond okay now that the the air of Pentecost is that it has to be a tongue but the revelation from the Bible is that it can be anything anything you can see in here that's the revelation of the Bible right so now let's go to the memory verse here first Thessalonians 5 14 beautiful portion of Scripture so let's do our memory verse here then we'll have you be seated 1st Thessalonians 5 I think it's 13 to 23 that's right after all 14 23 okay thank you sir yeah that's okay no it's okay remember bank had a rule on when the Beatitudes really that's good summer shorter somewhere along there wait till I do mine is gonna be a whole chapter whatever the Lord puts upon our hearts right my prayer is Jesus write it upon the fleshy tables in my heart and let in hours of trial I'll quote something from that yeah remember God is my fortress amen you know God is my strength in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus thank the Lord alright let's read 13 to 23 on three one two three and two esteem them very highly in love for their works sake and be at peace among yourselves now we exhort you brethren warn them that are unruly comfort the feeble-minded support the weak be patient toward all men see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men rejoice evermore pray without ceasing in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you quench not the spirit despise not prophesying --zz prove all things hold fast which is good abstain from all appearance of evil and the very God of peace sanctify you wholly and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ may God add His blessings arenas work may be seated praise God thank you again appreciate it very much here I had just a few guides my phone wasn't working here I was trying to update this app but it's not working here so let me just try to restart it and then I'll pull it up in just a minute okay so I like to look at this subject here the subject is the sea and here principle of Acts 233 and it's very important topic it's extremely important and needed I think this is one of the biggest sins of the church world today is that they will and my wife can tell you you know she what she and I were both in like college ministries right College Christian campus ministries and they just taught us to death just just get him to say a prayer and they're filled with the Holy Ghost like my wife even spent a summer out there for Campus Crusade talking to people like that you know and trying to get them to say the sinner's prayer and try to get them to believe in Jesus and it and you know got and then God then right around that time opened our eyes that you have to do more than just believe you've got to have this seal of the Holy Ghost and it's one of the biggest mistakes the church makes today is that they say oh you said a sinner's prayer now you're filled with the Holy Ghost it was really sad a few years ago we had a guest preacher come in to our Bible club and he was telling kindergarteners 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th that if they've said a prayer they have the Holy Ghost and they can do greater miracles than Jesus I was like this I was like oh lord have mercy because they just misunderstand the word yeah well I just had to bow my head and say Lord thankfully I can preach next week and try to straighten it out yeah and I did so that's the air of it is that it's so it's so wrong they're telling people they have power when they don't yeah they don't really have much power now I want to read you a quote because I found it today I was listening while I was you know weeding in the garden I found a good quote brother Branham says now the Holy Ghost is the seal of God this is from mark of the beast and seal of God Park to February 61 now if you said you believin haven't received the Holy Ghost think God's never recognized your faith yet that's right because the seal is the recognition that God has completed and finished his work in you that he recognized sure someone said well he said he said that's the beginning of the Spirit he says I'm sorry he says salvation is the beginning of the Spirit that's right I believe that a man as soon as you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ it's a portion of the Holy Spirit now that's what I've been preaching church through the statue by man as soon as you repent and believe you have a small anointing a man of the Holy Ghost all right you have to because faith has to be something it's either a natural thing or spiritual thing well it's a spiritual thing there's only two spirits good spirit bad spirit holy spirit unholy it's got to be the Holy Spirit it's an anointing of the Holy Spirit on your mind you have a change mine but then you got to get virtue as a act on another where's very key there Keith now she's late this time Lord lest virtue that's where your name came from virtue a second anointing of the Holy Spirit that's right that's the second anointing you get another portion God adds another portion but program says see you just got a portion he said but when you're sanctified another part of the Holy Spirit cleanses you then you're later filled with the Holy Ghost yeah so it's it's clear brother Ram says each one is just more and more of an anointing right you get anointed here right and then all of a sudden what it's all what everything's already then he fills your soul with the Holy Ghost and that's your job and my job to make sure this is always we know this is always gonna be anointed we got to keep a renewed anointing every day in our mind right that's right that's what brother man clearly teaches and most most people the message recognize that now some don't we've had that remember a few years ago I told you we had I think six preachers know six preachers I knew leave the message and two of them preached right from our pulpit no they didn't preach it they preached at our pulpit but later I found out they believe you got the Holy Ghost when you got baptized if I'd have known that I never would have invited them to preach but the reason I have items' the preachers because I I like their spirit they had a good spirit and heard him preach in another church and they seemed to live a godly life and huh and at that time I was just young and I thought well they got the Holy Ghost they've been preaching longer than me I found out not everybody who preaches has the Holy Ghost because the one brother got divorced and married another woman and now he's divorced from that woman and oh just so awful that proves you're not born again but you know it's surprising but that's the great failure of the church today but but it's not a wonder that they found that because it's a mystery Paul said it was a mystery hid from ages and generations Christ in you the hope of glory it's a myth though or no wonder they can't get it because it's a mystery it's only revealed to those who will seek God for the revelation remember what is a revelation to unbaling so see they got to see God and they really got to want to know and then God who unveiled the revelation raised God that's what the revelation means it means apocalypse which means unveiling God unveils that's what revelation was he's unveiling what he's doing at the end time praise God hallelujah now let's go back to acts 2 I just want to devote some time there and I'm gonna restart my phone and see if this app will work so I can show us just a few quotes just a lot of them are just reminder quotes but I think it's necessary to go over that let's see Church any promise of God when God says whosoever will anybody can have it but they got to believe it remember salvation is the whosoever will Romans 10 says whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved so Judas must have not called on God long enough right or he must have called but then later regretted he called and then blackstein the Holy Ghost because the Bible promises whosoever will I want to be saved will be saved and the same thing for the Holy Ghost in John 7 in revelation 22 the spear and the bride say come whosoever's thirsty let him come and drink on the waters of life everybody's invited for the New Jerusalem they just gotta come and believe praise God I will not turn anybody away from the Holy Ghost that's right jesus said and just keep your spot there but and Jesus said in John 6:37 all that the father had given me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will no wise cast out remember Jesus didn't cast out Judas Judas left Jesus Jesus said go do what you want to do so he did it wasn't Jesus saying yeah I don't like you but man said that's not how God doesn't God's not a respecter of persons God wants everybody to be saved amen but the fact that he knows what they're going to choose yes allow them to make the choice they want to make that's the only fair way to do it and so in Scripture and Acts 233 you're very familiar of course but this is a great principle and I wrote about it in the upcoming book I'm about 85% done with the book I almost done about my last two chapters I got a little bit left of another chapter to do I'm getting there by God's grace over 200,000 words so far I hope it's a gonna be a blessing than many people so in acts 233 Peters saying this is the Holy Ghost he shed it I looked shed what do you think of shed blood what do you think of running something running right so it's like God shed his heart right like his love from his heart and just poured out from heaven praise God that's that's the Peter gives the illustration of like shedding or running so that's why I was saying let it rain on Saturday night right let it rain open the floodgates let it shed fog praise God in other words let it fall let the rain fall upon the souls hallelujah and he says and then when it falls when it's shed for it when it when it comes down you see it and you hear it upon people's lives okay so let's go back and acts 2 a little bit earlier now you know though they all now look at verse 4 and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to what speak did they get silent no they started speaking right speaking so when the Holy Ghost fell something caused them to say something now let's go back to our children in that brother Joe and I texted him today and I told him what a blessing it was everybody up here hopefully when they're praying for him we're speaking out loud something like I love you Jesus that's what I was telling him I don't know if they heard me about saying say I love you Jesus say fill me Jesus I'm just I believe your promise Jesus I was trying to tell them to just say that because pretty soon you then that was no Ethan you're gonna believe it and it's going to strike and you're gonna get born again now you may get happy you may get sad you may get joyful you might shout speak in tongues and dance or whatever you might do a lot of different things but one thing's for sure you're gonna speak praise God you're gonna praise God somehow well it can be it can be just like a trembling you know it used to be a trembling and thank you Jesus you don't have to be loud or quiet it just has to be some something you can hear praise God now let me prove it to church brother BAM be precise in the churches but everybody receives the Holy Ghost in some type of different way but it's all something you can see you're here like on the day of Pentecost they had fire over everybody's forehead I've never seen anybody with fire over their forehead yet I believe they're born again right I've never seen like he told the man with paralyzed man he said silver gold have I none rise and walk in the name of Jesus Christ he's a very gifted man I've never seen a man do that I've talked to people that him said they'd be done that but see God gives everybody else a kind of individual unique experience within the baptism with all the ghosts and but the only way to know is look at the fruit of your life if you say you've got the seed brother amen if you say that seed is alive in your soul then it has to produce some free because you say you've got a seed that's made alive amen you it has to produce some type of fruit and the only time I think that the only time I know that there won't be fruit brother amen and the saint is like at the end of a life and let's say I believe or gets dementia or something like that because that happened up in brother Randy sizes Church one of the believers got dementia and they started I mean they were a faithful godly safe for like 50 or 60 years but they got a dementia and they started saying I don't believe in Jesus I don't and they started say evil things that's what the brothers told me up there that's the only time I think where you would lose you lose fruits of the Holy Spirit right when you lock but see that's just that's just losing here it ain't losing here Jesus said I come to give you rest for your soul praise God that's the reason he gave and that's why when brother Branham says and I know it's in 1953 demonology but he says you can be completely insane and still have the Holy Ghost that's why I believe that because even though dementia is not insanity you've lost your mind yeah okay now I don't know how far in sin you could go no let me go to a different topic now let me go to backsliding I don't know how far you can go backsliding with the baptism the Holy Ghost that's something I don't know I'm talking about somebody that just disobeys the word okay and then their mind will get so messed up from their sin I don't know how far they can go but I personally don't believe somebody can do all those things that that whole list that Paul gives us idolatry or negation homosexuality child abuse I don't believe a Holy Ghost filled Saint can do those things yeah I don't believe you can backside that far Oh Graham says me backside eighty but if you're a real saint of God if you've got that conviction if you've got that dumb nature in there like I hurt real bad say this week how can a dumb eat with the crows he can't but the crow can eat with the Dubs all right the crow can eat good things and then evil things right they can like the anointing one day but they love sin the next day but it dove it's only a dog I didn't start my timer so right now I just thought about that okay just put it on thirty minutes so yeah there I go again just forget about um having such a good time in the presence of the Lord so I know I don't but see if you're a dove and you got that nature and if you start eating and I grow bad lied to the IRA that's a good example he started eating uh you know that he realized oh I got to go confess it yeah it wasn't long until he confessed it see and so that's how I think a Holy Ghost filled Saint is they might start you know nibbling on that little bit you know but there is I can't I can't live like this I can't live with bitterness and I can't live with this complex I can't live with this lust I can't live with this greed I can't live with this idolatry I got to make it right that's what I believe about the Holy Ghost because I that's backed by Scripture now can somebody doubt you have the Holy Ghost yes remember we showed it from Galatians Paul said you you know he said you the very you left the law but now you're letting the law come back in and say now the men have to be circumcised to be saved he said I he's not needed travail it again with you to your birth in Christ he said because I doubt that you're born again so Paul see that's the thing I love it - there there is bruise right there a man can't always tell we can't know really who's born again all the time right he said I doubt you're born again alright unless God shows you by a vision someone saved or sealed or not how you gonna know you're not you can't prove it you can't show your soul to anybody I wish I could open up a door and say see I got that seat for those old yeah I wish I had that don't you I wish I could open up and you can see the light you know shine it out and there's the glory of God you can always tell what I'm thinking by my words right you can see it the light shining up here by my words if I'm walking in faith and walking in strength and victory oh you know you know my mind's renewed right and so I don't know how far you can go but but look as soon as the Holy Ghost Falls they speak and then look at the Bible says look at verse verse six now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and they were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language this was noised abroad so they were speaking of tongues now this is their galley and thumbs right it wasn't unknown tongues it was Galilean tongue they were speaking in Galilean tongues and they were saying all the wonderful works of God and it got so loud program tells us they went out into the streets they just had to they just had to get he imagine 120 people in a small room like this mercy how many seats do we have they just learned a small upper room they were rich you know they just had this small little casa uh-huh this is low and they just read they were so happy they just ran out the streets and we're saying the wonderful word God send the Holy Ghost aboard again thank you Jesus hallelujah I know I'm filled with the Spirit of God they were just worshiping and then you know the Walker bought the walkers and everybody walked in violence hey did you guys see what they're going on down there and everybody all these seventeen nations come around and look at them and it was perfect God was calling together for the first sermon the first Holy Ghost sermon and then 3,000 people believed and got the board us on the salvation experience praise God so you got noise dubrovsky any time someone is born again there's got to be noise see there's gotta be speaking some type of worship it doesn't have to be loud right it don't have to be it can be quiet but if there has to be something people see to know you're born again now let me read the next verse eleven Crete's and Arabians we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God so they were Galilee in talking about how wonderful Jesus is Jesus you're wonderful oh you saved our souls you died for us on the cross you're so wonderful Jesus and now you're raised from the dead and you sent your Holy Spirit and they're hearing it in their own languages Oh hallelujah thank the Lord it's so simple but the schools just over two million miles most of them deny it some of them say it's in the past and some of them say huh you don't have to have that you don't need that it's nonsense right they got it all wrong but this is what we should have that's what we believe we should declare the wonderful works of God amen think about when you got born again you were surprised saying praise the Lord thank you Jesus hallelujah I love you lord thank you Lord and you're the best of the Lord I always serve your Lord and you're just saying how great wonderful God is amen glory amen so it has to be this way now if you would here let's go to acts for now you know you remember the story now they got you know Peter and James went down and they they spoke to this beautiful God healed miraculously now the one brother that's see done that brother Alexander Magilla said east and hid ministry over teens I think it happening if I'm not taken he said they pray for a parallels a paralyzed man that could walk and they phoned him up in the name of Jesus so I believe that praise God that's that's a blessing no and then they get questioned and then they get brought into the council and they said don't speak in the name of Jesus and Peter says those great words he said whether it's up to you he said whether obey God or man I'm gonna obey God it comes out of that I'm gonna obey God now it acts for they go have a prayer meeting you remember and the Bible said in verse 24 when they had heard that they lifted up their voice to God with one Accord so see there's times for quiet prayer right be still and know that I'm God right right there's time to be still well there's other times to lift up and cry loudly amen pray loudly there's times for that and they say and now Lord verse 29 and now Lord behold they're threatening and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness so see when you when someone gets the Holy Ghost they're usually bold that's why you hear something right there they're not ashamed of the Lord all boldness they may speak thy word by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy Holy Child Jesus when they prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the Word of God with baldness in other words whoever wasn't born again that was with them not born again at that time Jemez and I knew whatever was already born again they just got a fresh anointing in their minds praise God you're gonna get one steal the Holy Ghost as far as I can see in the soul I notice a bruising I don't ever see the scripture saying you get resealed in the soul but I see the scripture saying you renewed daily day by day in the spirit of your mind okay so again the house shakes they're praying loudly the Holy Ghost Falls make me bold the Holy Spirit falls and then they rejoice with all boldness praise God so see the Holy Ghost will always bring boldness right it'll bring you saying the wonderful works of God it'll bring boldness Acts chapter 8 this is after Philip had a great revival healing devil casting out ministry in Samaria and then he says well I need to call Peter and John down to pray for the Holy Ghost verse 15 who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost for as yet he was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost and went Simon see saw saw so it wasn't partaking of a wafer right it wasn't just saying a sinner's prayer scripted reading off a card can I say this I'll say that I said that it wasn't that Simon saw something here's a man who saw he saw people demon-possessed he saw be in possession he saw curses because he was a sorcerer he saw people shrivel under curses he saw demons you know do all kinds of crazy but yet the Holy Ghost baptism was so special and his heart was still kind of wrong before God he said let me give you money so I can see people act like that amen so think about that a man who saw demon powers and devil worshipping and all these things the Holy Ghost baptism was so special he wanted to give Peter money so he could do something like that that's how special this was now remember the remember this was a real revival people were healed the imagine if you had a whole Church of people healed and demons cast out what kind of church service wouldn't you have I mean every service would be like the Sandman service don't you everybody when everybody's on fire praying and worshiping and crying and praising the Lord thanking God for their victories and their deliverances and the supernatural presence of Jesus Christ what a atmosphere that must have been within Simon the sorcerer who knew all about spells and demonology and demon worship he says this is something different see because when Satan comes on people they don't get happy and rejoicing and declaring the wonderful works of God they get mean and evil right and they get aggressive and they get angry so see the Holy Spirit was sweet and gentle and joyful and bold exactly the opposite day men you know say tanika's oppression they have oppression with the demon worship and they might have some emotion obviously and some boldness and things like that but it was all for the evil spirit it was all for sin but with God its joy and victory and peace and true happiness and true joy in the presence of God amen at this demon worship or a former demon worshiper what did defame on you to see it you know I I want to see it - and I don't offer money I offer prayers that's why I come up here to the altar and pray God give us more times like that amen only God can send it it's just like the wind you don't know what it's gonna be a windy day now you can look on your phone and get a pretty good idea but I was even in the weeding today listening with a brand it was so hot but even as like 89 degrees on them Oh Lord is so hot and pretty soon a wind move through my house and you know it's like the landscape but you know oh it was the most refreshing wind I just said thank you Jesus I just raised my hand to heaven because I didn't know it was coming I don't even know what it's gonna come I said Lord is so hot and also there's like the most refreshing oh can it last a little longer but it was a good three or four seconds of just a refreshing wind church we don't know when the services are going to come but I want to be here Wednesday night could be Sunday night usually it's a Sunday morning or I guess I should say usually it's a Saturday night now a lot you've seen a lot of good services where those Saturday services many times the best service I don't know why that is I think as God likes the fellowship in the evening it come down to Adam and Eve to talk with him in the evening time but then he rose on a Sunday morning so God could mean anytime right well there's something special about Sarah night services okay now it was so amazing that when they got the Holy Ghost Simon said I want to pay money to see more of that I love these I was amazed to see people act like that when they got the Holy Ghost acts 10 remember and in the book I list there's only five times where the Bible says people were filled with the Holy Ghost in the book of Acts and we're going through all five quickly tonight so you can see it acts 10 Peter follows the vision and then the angel to go with these Gentiles to Chris's house and this was strictly forbidden this was there was discrimination those that they were talk about racism they had it probably worse than we got today it was wrong for Peter he didn't his mind it was wrong for him to go with Gentiles they were dirty all kinds of unclean and I don't want to be defiled I can do the waters of separation but he went by the vision and the Lord showed him I don't call unclean when I've cleansed and here like we heard for the cam saved but also Branham this is the way the Gentiles normally receive the Holy Ghost is just by hearing the word we've also laid hands on people they got the Holy Ghost - I got the Holy Ghost just by hearing the preaching of the word amen got it and who had got it by laying on of hands there's nothing wrong or we were just holding hands I think right which sister who I think that we're on our knees up here all over the hand so that's right Lydia was up here - I was after that service so it don't really matter how it comes what matters is that something happened to you and you worship the Lord Amen that's right it has to you has to produce something you have to know something is happening yeah right acts 10 now in acts 10 37 Peter starts this short short servant and look these people knew about Jesus they just not bet they have just not been born again now look at this that word I say you know he's talking about Jesus Cornelius knew about Jesus but he wasn't born again yet which was published throughout all Judaea and began from Galilee after the baptism which John preached okay so he knew about Jesus he knew only knew about John's baptism okay so Peter comes and he preaches now verse 44 is where the Holy Ghost falls while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word and my testimony was when brother Brooks was preaching the day after my wedding we got there late to church and I'm just I was in the back I think on the right side yeah I was in on the right side and Mother Russia was just preaching about the blood and people are standing up clapping I just stood up clapping he's he just remembered him in just going on and on about the blood and was the address I just closed my eyes I started crying and in my mind it's like I did a sideways I saw Jesus on the cross sideways like this but then I saw the nailing nails in his wrist and I started shaking like that my my body because I was feeling it's like I could feel the vibrations of that and I just started crying I just started I don't know how lot of ways I was just like thank you Jesus hallelujah praise be to God I love your Lord Jesus it was just right dirt and all they did was cry and I was looking around I was brainless but after I left the service I just I never shake in the Deacons hand be like god bless you I was so happy and I told my wife I said I said after that I was filled with love and I just wanted to love everybody after that and it was a week later when I was that brother sandals Church he was preaching on the Holy Ghost and it helped me know I was like yeah that's what happened to me thank God I can look back and say yeah okay that's how the Holy Ghost makes you act that's what I acted like I didn't run around the church I didn't prophesied and speak in tongues but I was speaking I was speaking my love for Jesus amen poorly hey brother brother Jose I never done that to service before I never stood up shouted and raised my hands and cried and praise the Lord hallelujah probably just like this thank you lord thank you Jesus my wife might remember about though she remembers are not so many years ago so that what all's I know is that I did saw I acted in a way I never acted before and I looked in my life afterwards and I could tell I was a different person and if I didn't live a different life than I know I didn't get it in the so I just got it in the mind but I've seen temptation after temptation and God's been giving me victory after victory after vain and I've tried sister Beatrice to keep this with the word I've tried to be true to God's Word with everything I preached by God's grace so that's what happened and now look they weren't even baptized because Peter says in verse 47 could any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which is receive the Holy Ghost see but members they were already fasting praying and giving alms if people with the Holy Ghost you got to do that too that's part of sanctification you've got a fast you got to pray you got to give all shut it you got to start living for the people praise God Amy they were already living a sanctified life they just didn't know about the new baptism or the Holy Ghost baptism so when Peter preaches it they're all sanctified and they believe it and they get failed and then Peter said now you go back and get baptized in water just to let everybody know in your town that you're a real Christian God what's that he wants you to make that public testimony he want you to meet other change I didn't really go for the months of believers and say I've died to myself the old Jesse Smith is crucified and a new one has risen up up by the pile on top hey he wants you to be so bold form that you're willing to do that and be baptized in water whether you got the Holy Ghost or not he said I want you to be baptized he that believeth is baptized shall be saved st. it's part of the process now people don't have a chance of course they'll be saved even if they're not baptized they will be saved people ask me all the time with a man I get questions all the time on this can you get the Holy Ghost without knowing brother Branham of course because brother Branham ain't the one that gives the Holy Ghost but if you hang around the message preaching long enough with the Holy Ghost you'll start saying whoa where did they get this from this thing come out of seminary you tell me where you got that preacher and then the thing I got from the prophet of God right people ask me all the time and of course you can get the only ghost without knowin brother Branham you have to know Jesus because John the Baptist says there's one coming after me that's mightier than me and he all just baptize you in water baptize you with the Holy Ghost amen oh yeah Jesus Christ is the one the only one who baptizes with all ghost so true now let's just read pull up a few Lydia John 14 18 just pull that up real quick you oh no something's happening like I said I didn't know was the baptism holy ghost but I knew something was happening to me I was loving Jesus I was I was declaring the wonderful works of God amen I was seeing that's the only time I've ever had like a vision like that my mind the only time never had that ever happen since now look I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you you'll know when Jesus is coming to you yeah you'll cry you'll shout you'll leave something that something's got happen if Jesus has never been with you and then he comes to know something's happened to me I walked out is there different or so I feel different I know there's something different about me and then watch your attitude towards sin that's how you'll know yeah you know you'll go to more godliness all the time there's no he said I will guide you into all truth yeah oh guy sees guy you to be guided the truth or guided into iniquity right that's one of the chapter I'm right right now a Nick would God hates Nick we I remember the seal the Holy Ghost Timothy Center Paul told Timothy he said to seal the Holy Ghost is that anyone that names the name of Jesus Christ depart from iniquity amen Nathan that's how you know see he's dying you on a path away from iniquity which is purposeful sinning even though you know you're wrong that's iniquity remaining in addictions but when you got the Holy Ghost he's guiding you away from addictions away from purposeful sinning into righteousness and holiness that's the seal hot on it the seal of the Holy Ghost is that if you name the name of Christ depart from iniquity let's let's let's pull it up here I think I think I pulled it I don't know where it is about and I know the words in it depart Nick witty it's second Timothy 2:19 thank you I appreciate technology and I would a blessing it's just a little bit faster than brother and brother Graham had it we had that big concordance you November that thick book brother Jose I can't believe what yet oh hey that's the best we had can you guys be turning all the pages and you gotta find it just the one word seal you know you gotta go down ah there's what I'm looking nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal that the Lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity that's why you should enjoy coming to every service because I'm trying the Holy Spirit in me is trying to point you to a more holy light and if you don't like that it's your because you're not born again because iniquity is sin loving a saint loving religious masks or just come to church act like everything's okay but behind the scenes you love the world and and evil and wickedness and just act like you're holy do your hair everything looks nice that's iniquity but Christ if you really love Christ you want to get closer to him and you want to get victories over the struggles that you have hey you want to really show Christ loves everybody amen go to verse okay John 14 20 million you're getting a good workout tonight 14 20 you will know he said I'll come to you okay if he comes to you you're gonna know something happened whether cuz you know something emotional happened that never happened to you before right it has it has to be different than just you know something in the spirit or mine it has to be something deep inside you John 14:23 I you will know you'll know something happened you might not have known it was the Holy Ghost when it happened but but afterwards you look at it while something happened something did happen to me that's what happened to me I didn't know cuz I got it I wasn't studying up it was strange I was reading the church age book at that time I wasn't studying really the Holy Ghost baptism until we heard brother Samuel preach on it that's a great series he did at that that you should know that I am in my father and your and me and I'm in you you won't wonder if he's in you you'll know he's in you say your guests and your hope that I'm in you he said you'll know it why cuz it's Christ living his life you know your life what you know no sometimes I look back and God will use me in a way I'm like how did I even say that how did I know to do that and I'll say let's see that was Christ it wasn't me it was Christ like how could I've done that how could I have said that oh god help that person it wasn't my thought it was Christ in me praise God remember anything good you do it wasn't you it was Christ because apart from Christ you can do nothing see go to 21 he said that day but family says that's the last day that end does he that he that hath my Commandments and she keeps them you got the Holy Ghost you'll keep the word he it is that loveth me see that's how you love God you want to obey God's commands and he that loveth me shall be loved in my father and I will love him and I'll manifest myself I see that means that means appear manifest means appear some way he'll appear to you like he comes at you and dreams which is awesome both of you that's wonderful he might appear to me as I'm studying and bringing the word to me or I'll speak the word like I'll speak to her the mountain or something like that the Lord will do it through me somehow he'll appear to you he has to does he promise they met he said I've got to give them a better comfort than just a physical body I've got to give them an inward permanent constant source of my presence amen that's right verse 28 - what are you 22 and 23 Lydia 14 22 there you go Judas say the name not as Skerritt Lord how's that I will manifest thyself to us and not the whole world how you gonna do this just to us and out the whole world that description Jesus answers at him if a man love me go keep my words you know the reason people don't get a born-again cuz they don't love holiness and they don't keep the commands of God Yeah right and my father will love him and we will come into him and make our abode with him see a boat that means he's gonna dwell with you he's gonna camp out in your soul praise God Hey not just for a night for all your nights amen right he's gonna be a permanent resident but see that's the reason how come you're not gonna show yourself to sinners because they don't love the command they don't even take the first anointing of faith I believe in Jesus Christ I need Jesus Christ died for my sin I believe all the history bruises thank God I got faith in him he died for my sins he arose so much I got faith in they won't even take that first anointing so how they gonna get the rest of it they're not cuz it's a slow steady process of filling the vessel praise God amen as far as I'm sorry filling the mind right doing the mind alright acts 19 beautiful scripture here now you acts 19 this is when Paul says have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed since and Lord willing it looks like you know times sake I may have - oh here we go yeah don't switch over yet but in a minute thank the Lord so I just had to reset my phone that's good sometimes when things don't work in our lives we just gotta hit the reset button praise God just start all over say Oh forgive me like I made that mistake on Sunday I thought everybody that the bland family was coming here I just it was my mistake so if they're a stream and forgive me he's in the process of praying about a home church so I felt so awful Church I woke up on Monday morning and it was like this Billy man I saw it's like I saw these words in my mind you've sinned against the Lord so I right away I called brother would I call first I call brother Jim first yup or the gym because that's that was their home church and I said brother now I'll tell you the testimony later not tonight I'm out of time but it's a good it's a good experience I said brother Jim I send here and here I think that's what caused me to say it wrong I was presuming and then I called brother Johnny explain the same thing to him but it's like I woke up and that's how the Lord will speak to me it's like I saw that I saw like a black screen I saw these words in my mind honest that's why I felt my mind you have sinned against the Lord that's why I called him up to forgive ask the Lord to forgive me I'm thankful the Holy Spirit can correct me praise God and like I said we I think we prayed for the Bland's that God would just guide them wherever they don't have to come here if they're interested I mean they're more than welcome I told mother Johnny on the phone some things I believe and this is how I've run it at the church and you know just probably about it take your time no no no pressure but I misunderstood because I'd sinned against the Lord but I confessed it to Jim and brother Johnny so I thank the Lord it's something personal I'll tell you about later by God's grace I'd say about there okay so acts 19 yeah have you received Holy Ghost since you believe now they believe Apollo's had taught them the word about bat John's bat they only knew John's baptism but Peter I'm sorry but Paul says you got to believe in Christ now verse 5 when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul laid his hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied and all the men were about 12 praise God so they spake in tongues and prophesied now I don't know okay there's my timer I got 10 more minutes okay that was my 30-minute timer I'll do one more 10 minute time is that good that is that right okay is it yeah okay all right so let me do five here thank you appreciate that I do need help i need help hey I made a reminder on my phone just breeze 35 or 45 minutes with three exclamation marks fine just try to control yourself if you can so uh here they magnified God they spake in tongues erm and they prophesied and everybody could tell right that something happened these people and there was only 12 there's small Holy Ghost group now I forgot one verse Lydia acts 1046 for when they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God yeah so that's the part left out yeah can you yeah there you go now look magnify so you'll be you might be bold you might be weeping you might declare the wonderful works of God but you will mag that's not like before they even sing that song magnify the Lord with me I like that like yeah I said that's nice what's on my mind right now you know you got the Holy Ghost but you want to magnify Jesus amen you want to lift him up you want to be bold you want to praise the name of the Lord that's what happened when they got the Holy Ghost they just heard the preaching they stopped cussing oh thank you Jesus and the Holy Ghost fell from happening so we have to we have to just take the scripture now my children can my children look up here so can everybody see how when something when the Holy Ghost Falls usually you see in here something I'm not sure to understand that okay because we didn't we didn't really get a chance to talk about this hell I said I'll save it for Wednesday night because then I got their full attention praise God now go to acts 11:15 so Peter after her scene coordinators get the Holy Ghost he goes back to Jerusalem he's all happy and the Saints are like hey how was your meeting oh good I went into a Gentile house was like what you can't go to James outhouse and he's opposed just listen let me tell you and he told them what happened and the way he described it he said he said the same way we acted when we got it on the day of Pentecost that's the same way they acted there wasn't anything different the way they knew and the people and the brothers didn't argue like they're like praise God Amen they were just happy yeah Ernest and as I began to speak the Holy Ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning we just read it all they did was magnify God oh I don't know but they saw something and they heard something see something has to happen so the proof of the Holy Ghost baptism and seeing and hearing something is Peter saying it fell the same way now let me tell you about testimony from brother Brooks's Church in 2017 I went out there I cuz I wrote it on my notes our December I remember December 2017 the young man he was 18 I think her yeah he was on the piano I said not who wants I'm sorry said come on up for prayer everyone's prayer I didn't know what he's gonna but he come up for the batches and well he goes Church I just prayed for him and he was just Bravo's and just cry like this that's always described say thank you Jesus brother Brooks said I left the next day after preaching he said that guy came and told me I got the Holy Ghost and brother Brooks said II spent the last three years leading youth meetings trying to get the youth to be born again he gets better his music all the time and he's telling people he got born again but I prayed for him he's got the fruits up he didn't dance around he didn't prophesy but what he was making noise right I saw him he was making noise he was visibly something's happening to him crazy large and his life has lined up with his testimony praise God I didn't see fire overs for it I didn't see him speak in a galilean tongue or a Russian town or an Italian tongue but something happened to him he knew something would happen I praise God and now his life lines up with this confession so I want to make sure I say that yeah December 2017 brother amen and his wife who or tell me when they got the Holy Ghost they got on different weeks you know now he was telling me they spent that whole week cleaning out their houses cleaning out anything that would displease God are their houses and brother hey man told me specifically I remember I talked to him more than talk to sister who of course yeah uh but he was saying he was listening to sermons about the Holy Ghost that we remember that and then Simon preached some of the similar things that you were listening to from brother Branham like and you knew you weren't gonna leave that service he got the Holy Ghost so after everybody left he went knocked on the door got Simon came out and Simon's hand felt huge right like a angel was touching it and everybody knows but Amen this is a room and different people since those times everybody can tell I can tell I know I can tell for sure and and so it can happen anyway like it can be a variety of manifestations but something has to happen to you that you that everybody can see something's happening and here's something happening yeah cuz Peter said the way it fell remember he said a shed forth something you see in here what it shed for there it has to shed forth there and every time afterwards okay now switch over I got a couple minutes here of course I didn't get to everything but you understand now preach this a long time ago I want to go over this here that's not it okay yeah here's just a few quotes as we close here sure change buh buh gram he teaches how the batches of the Holy Ghost comes after you believe you get justified sanctified then the Baptist oligos he says he's teaching this with thus saith the Lord so see Church we have the revelation of the batson Holy Ghost it's thus sayeth the Lord it's not the it's not it's not the way my wife and I were taught in college just say a sinner's prayer now you're filled with the Holy Ghost and now you can do greater works than Jesus come on that's nonsense no one is apt let me tell you no one's ever do any works greater than Jesus the RAM said so that greater means more it doesn't mean you can do something greater than the Son of God the Virgin born son of God you think you can do something greater than the Virgin born of God who is God in the flesh no you can't don't deceive yourself I don't think anybody believes that here but I've heard preachers say that in the message and brother I'm plainly says that he said you can't do anything greater than Jesus I don't know what their I don't know what they're listening to I don't know I want to make myself very clear on the Baptist Holy Ghost is according to the word now look children we just did the word tonight right I took you through all the five times where the Holy Ghost fell Peter said that fell on us the same way as it did on cornices house it was through a freedom worship it was through a liberating emotional experience they magnified God they declared his wonderful works sometimes they spoke in tongues sometimes they prophesied sometimes they didn't but they acted the same way they were birthed they were born see it's not a coordinate but I said the Holy Ghost and according to me it's according to you he said it's not according to you it's according to the stay at the lower the Word of God the word the word where does that say baloney okay not 1953 and listen here woman you got to be salting listen this you realize up there when they all went to the 120 went up to pray they never done like Baptists do they shake hands and put their name on a book say yes I'm born again is there's no scripture for that now then he says we methods go on prohibition for six months and there's no such Scripture in the Bible but the Bible said when the day of Pentecost was fully come there came a sound from heaven like a rushing mighty wind Haven do you still have that testimony you felt a win hey he's got sister who I did too right weekend was here preaching though about a year and half ago that's part of the Holy Spirit I feel some wind glory and it filled all the house where they were setting and the power of God so enclosed those people anointed them so they run on the street screaming and dancing and hollered and that's like a bunch of drunk people that's the scripture thus saith the Lord so see however they acted in acts we have to have something similar to that right it won't be the same like I said like I guess I'm one of pillars of fire look like God just did that one time but we have to have some type of freedom some emotion on out here yeah let me speak this a minute did you know where that class I thought about spiritual dignity like being quiet in church dignity stop being a fanatic he said class is of the devil now that's thus saith the Lord of the Bible class and pomp came from the devil in the very beginning when Cain and Abel came up to worship can come by the before the Lord in class Abel came in righteousness by revelation see class and dignified worship and everybody sitting still my wife was there Lutheran Church and boy they got a lot of class right I'm sure that we went to a Catholic a funeral couple years ago they got a lot of class but the Holy Spirit is freedom its joy its bonus it's a gratefulness it's Liberty its magnifying guys it's praising God amen it's not a bunch of class and structure and routine all the time but man says you got to get out of routine to get the Holy Ghost right true it's true okay I think that's it yeah that's it because that was old sermon preacher all right let's send our feet praise God I just want to go over that for our children's sake and I liked one thing brother Brook said I like my brother Brook said he said he said even if you don't get it he said just confess that you got it and don't tell anybody there don't take anybody's word that you don't got it now why is that important it's the same thing it's the same attitude you should have - any promise of God if God reveals you let's say you're sick and God reveals you're going to be healed take that same attitude I'm healed even though I don't feel it Aiko's any right you could say that's not if God has revealed to you that you're gonna be here then you tell everybody I'm gonna be made well I know God's gonna hear me and that's the that's all brother Brooks is saying take the same attitude I've repented I've been baptized I'm gonna get the Holy Ghost some time another that's what he was saying here he wasn't saying pretend just pretend you got nobody ghost he's saying just trust in the promise of God don't let anybody tell you talk to you Jesus said whosoever will then come entry of the living sea living waters it's like it's gonna flow on me right so you gotta praise God oh I magnify it might be a whisper it might be a screen it might be a shout it might be a speaking in tongues it might be a prophesied but something is gonna happen when you get the whole they gonna say something oh there's thunder the voice of God it's like Amen - were preaching closer I was gonna close that the greatest services I've ever had is when I preached those sermons about the baptism the Holy Ghost we had a 5 hour service
