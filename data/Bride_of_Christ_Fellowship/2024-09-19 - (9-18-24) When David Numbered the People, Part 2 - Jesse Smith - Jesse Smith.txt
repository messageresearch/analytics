anoint your word Lord as we preach your word father Jesus Christ's name amen amen praise God we're just do a a little sermon here we're going to do a followup to part one we preached on there Sunday uh when David numbered the people we'll preach a part two here so we'll start start in 1 Chronicles 21 by the grace of God we'll start at verse uh 18 you know Sunday by God's grace we preach on part one uh that was a blessing to my heart I trust it was to other people as well um I spent most of my time in 2 Samuel 24 so I'd like to look at this parallel passage a little bit here tonight um in 1 Chronicles 21 we'll start at Verse 18 so we'll just get right into the study here by God's grace we're not going to stand because then we have to adjust the uh uh the laptop here we're just live streaming off a laptop um but we give honor to the Lord of course through our prayers and our worship we give all honor to the Lord Jesus Christ I guess we'll just start at Verse 18 here by God's grace uh then the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to say to David that David should go up and set up an altar unto the Lord in the threshing floor of ornan the jebusite and David went up at the saying of GAD which he spake in the name of the Lord so here he had thus sayith the Lord he had the name of the Lord from the prophet of God so let's have one more word of prayer we ask God to bless the the word of God father God bless this reading of Thy word thank you for the truth of the scripture Lord It's life-changing Lord It's prophetic Hallelujah Lord it's uh what we have need of It's Our Daily Bread Lord God we're thankful for that we need the daily bread today Lord as we want to eat the book lord we want to swallow this word up this Revelation Lord God that one day life might swallow us up Lord God in Victory so we're speaking of course of the Rapture Lord God as we've been looking at and so father uh bless this word here tonight in Jesus Christ's name amen amen so we looking at a few uh thoughts here out of this uh chapter 1 Corinthians I'm sorry 1 Chronicles 21 pardon me so verse 18- 19 uh we see the angel commanding the prophet and of course this reminds me of how prophets numerous times had specific angels to them you know we know uh Moses had an angel given unto him I believe it was in Exodus 22 and uh the Lord told Moses to honor this Angel respect this Angel and and the angel had a great activity in the ministry of Moses then we saw it in the book of Acts where St Paul had an angel uh that was the Bible said that he belonged to so that was his we'd say his guardian angel or the angel given to him for his life and his ministry that was the angel that met him uh in the bottom of the boat and told him that no men would lose their lives and that came to pass so the angel gave him a pro a prophetic word and that was thus sayith the Lord and it came to pass and of course brother bradam had an angel that with him or was with him by God's grace from 46 to the end of his uh life end of his life there by God's grace through 65 and so we see here that that just reminded me you know the angel Lord met with Gad the prophet Gad was the the major prophet of that day of course we know David was a minor Prophet um that's quite a thought because so many of his Psalms were prophetic he had many many prophetic Psalms course Psalm 22 of the of the crucifixion and uh you know numerous other uh prophecies there psalm 16 with the resurrection uh God would not leave uh his soul in Hell Hallelujah so the Lord Jesus Christ he would not suffer the Lord Jesus Christ to see corruption so so although he's a minor Prophet had some really major prophecies we might say uh by God's grace so we see this Angel here commanding the prophet of God and then he's told David is told with thus say the Lord to sacrifice on Mount Mariah um and we saw how that was a uh Mariah was a very special place and still is um we saw the history you know we we want to just briefly review that uh how it started there in Genesis 14 with Abraham uh that's where uh the southern part of Jerusalem was where uh mzc God in flesh met Abraham of course we're Abraham's seed by faith in Jesus Christ Hallelujah and then Joshua couldn't conquer Mount Mariah uh but then David was able able to conquer it of course and he danced uh before the Lord as the ark came into the the city of David it was called uh by the grace of God joab got the victory um and became of course a leader there through that victory was given great uh rewards for his battle there uh then of course we know Solomon built the temple right there on Mount Mariah so this very uh this very threshing floor that David purchased became the location of uh Solomon's Temple and then of course herod's Temple right now it's the Dome of the Rock but uh the Dome of the Rock is there on the Temple Mount but we know Israel will get it back somehow by the grace of God the scripture tells us that they'll build uh the Temple of the Lord so they'll have that Temple back uh sometime in the future by the grace of God of course we know this uh is a special location we know the millennial Temple will be built built there and then of course the future home when it comes down from God out of Heaven it'll be called the New Jerusalem so of course Jerusalem is the city of Peace as uh mzc is called the king of Peace So it's God's City it's the city of the great king Hallelujah so it's a beautiful city and we're thankful you know for the the scriptures that we saw and we saw I just going to briefly review again here um how um we saw how God's anger was kindled against Israel and so God allowed David's uh desire to number the people to line up with uh God chasing hening the people and uh God works everything out for his glory we looked at how we're not to Kindle the anger of the Lord keep our lives free from Idols that's why I believe Paul said that and also St John said little children keep yourselves from idols and then uh Satan provoked or lured or enticed David David had the people numbered or his mighty or his men numbered his vant men numbered um and then uh it was course sworn by joab uh but then once David did this his heart smoted him and uh God gave him a choice of his punishment he chose the three days of pestilence um and David knew it's better to fall in the hands of a merciful god than sinful men uh the plague was uh carried out by the angel of the Lord he had the sword of the Lord and he started that Dan swoop down to beerseba then he came back up to Jerusalem and uh you know it was going to take a blood sacrifice in order to stay the plague the Bible said and that's when the the angel directed The the prophet to tell David to buy the threshing floor which later become the Temple Mount later becomes um you know Solomon's Temple the location of Solomon's Temple he buys it from ornan the jebusite and then it said the Bible said God was moved with compassion and God told the angel it's enough so uh the pestilence stopped right there at the Temple Mount right there at where the future Temple would be and so that's kind of where we're picking up here I just want to pull out a few more thoughts there uh by God's grace then we saw how there was at least 10 foreshadowings there's probably many many more uh but there's 10 foreshadowings of the cross in the Old Testament it's a blessing to see that uh by the grace of God so uh I think we'll pick up right there in 1 Corinthians I'm sorry 1 Chronicles 21 18 and 19 uh David went up to sacrifice uh in the name of the Lord now verse 20 says ornan turned back and saw the angel and His Four Sons with him hid themselves now ornan was threshing wheat so uh very interesting he's threshing wheat here and he sees the angel of the Lord and he and his sons hide themselves you know we get this idea of uh there's over 300 sometimes the Bible says fear not or don't fear you know God is constantly telling the people not to fear so the spirit of fear is something we battle often and of course when the Angels were present or the presence of Jesus would appear to individuals in the Bible uh he would say fear not even after the resurrection of course the Lord would say fear not um so we get the same idea uh that the Lord is to be feared and when God uh manifests his glory his presence uh it's a fearful thing so ornan and his sons hide themselves they run from the presence of the Lord Of course that reminds us of Adam running from the presence of the Lord the presence of the Lord is a very sacred holy serious thing and Oran and his sons experience that they hide themselves uh we see that there and of course this is like when brother Bram you know first met the angel Lord uh he felt like very afraid uh in the presence of God and he said you he never got used to that and you you and I none of us would ever get used to that Holy sacred presence it's a presence that we can't get used to and thank God for that uh we don't want that to become common we don't want our love for God to become common uh we want to always respect the presence of the Lord hallelujah and so brother Ram says it makes us humble when we come into His presence so we see this same thing happening to Oran and His Four Sons they get humble in the presence of the Lord now verse 21 uh and as David came to ornan ornan looked and saw David and went out of the threshing for and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground uh so this is not an act of worship this is an act of total humility oran's not trying to worship God I'm sorry or's not trying to worship David he's just in a real fear of the Lord a real reverential fear and he throws himself down at David's feet um because he's a servant of the Lord so we see ornan humbling himself in the presence of David and so this is kind of like a little correction I have for myself on um on Sunday you know next ornan offers David with all these sacrifices and uh on Sunday I think I said it wrong but here clearly we can see that ornan offers all these sacrifices because of his great respect for the angel of the Lord Lord right he saw the angel with a sword drawn and due to his fear and due to his respect for God he offers all these sacrifices that he already has right there ready to go so this was an act of reverence from ornan this was an act of his respect for the angel of the Lord uh to want to give David these animals to sacrifice so I want to make sure I corrected that uh by God's grace it was ornan being humble humbly offering David the opportunity to provide the sacrifices uh to the Lord due to the fear of the Lord and his respect for the angel of the Lord in verse 22 then David said to ornan grant me the place of this threshing floor that I may build an altar therein unto the Lord Thou shalt Grant it me for the full price that the plague may be stayed from the people and so David wants to pay the full price David doesn't want to discount on his sacrifice uh and Friends there's no shortcut cuts to Holiness right there's no shortcuts to the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's no shortcuts to getting your first love back brother Ram says how are you repented at the first time when you got your first love he said that's the same repentance we have to do to get our first love back and that's why it was so wonderful when brother Paul Griffin was here to see Souls tearing at the altar laying at the altar I was up there at the altar praying on a couple occasions came down there went left come back and spent time praying there um so we see there's no shortcuts it takes a Full Sacrifice um fully giving yourself over to the ways of God right fully returning uh to the Lord if we want our first love back and there'll be no Shortcuts To The Rapture right a each and every wise virgin had to have the extra oil each and every person in the parable of Matthew uh 22 of the parable of of the King's son the marriage for the King's son everyone had to have a white garment the man that did who came through the window or came some other way he tried to have a shortcut he tried to have a a partial sacrifice right a partial dedication but we're shown by David here and of course other scriptures that you must have a uh you must pay the full price right you must fully die out seek God daily Hallelujah die die out to yourself Die daily the scripture plainly tells us by the grace of God this is because Jesus Paid the full price for our sins uh he laid aside his splendor he was beaten un so un Merc mercifully uh that he said he didn't even look like a man the Bible say he didn't look like a man he looked more like a worm and so only a full sacrifice in David's case could stop the plague of course that's what Jesus's death was it was a Full Sacrifice to pay the full punishment for sin that's the only sacrifice that could stay uh the plague of sin upon Humanity where now in the New Testament now we can be New Creations in Christ Jesus uh under the Old Testament the blood of bulls and goats could never fully do away with sin so Jesus had to pay the full price uh he had to become a curse he had to become sin that we might be blessed and that we might be made Jesus's righteousness Hallelujah all through the sacrifice the full payment of sin uh placed upon God's sacrifice the Lamb of God the great Redeemer Jesus Christ and so only a Full Sacrifice could stay the plague from the city in David's time only a Full Sacrifice of Jesus Christ could take away all our sins and uh save us from a certain death right a certain judgment Jesus took our judgment so we can be pardoned by the grace of God hallelujah verse 23 and ornan said unto David take it to thee and let my Lord the king do that which is good in his eyes lo I give Thee the ax and also for burnt offerings and the threshing instruments for wood and and wheat for the meat offering I give it all verse 24 and the King said unto ornan nay but I will verely buy it for full price for I will not take that which is thine for the Lord nor offer burnt off offerings without cost so we as we said on uh Sunday David learned not to take anything from another man he took uriah's wife basba paid heavily for that lost four sons and uh so much more public shame because he did a private sin he had all this public shame and so David learned from that I don't take anything from another man uh My Sacrifice must be given from my heart from myself in this case from my purse right he had to pay uh the 600 600 shekels of gold and so uh David learns David again has to tell him no I'm giving a Full Sacrifice I must pay the the cost for this sacrifice and church that that's what what it must be with us we must learn how to sacrifice we must learn how to sacrifice our time our finances our resources whatever we can sacrifice for other people we must learn to do that we can't let everybody else do all the sacrifice and we've got to step up we've got to give God a pleasing sacrifice when the time calls for sometimes the visit to the uh the hospital sometimes it's a visit to someone's house uh sometimes it's a financial thing sometimes it's consecrating uh shutting in with God you know before brother Des McBride came we had 30 minutes of prayer each each know of those days extra prayer uh sometimes uh God calls us to a total sacrifice uh so we must be open to that we must realize that if we want uh if we want to please God then we must give a total sacrifice David knew that uh in this case David knew he had to do that so God honored that by God's grace all right so verse 25 and 26 and so David gave to ornan for the place 600 shekels of gold by weight I just briefly tried to look this up and it seems like 600 shekels of gold in today's currency would be around $300,000 but that's not taking in uh you know the U the massive inflation so a pretty hefty cost and David didn't take out a loan for this he had this money uh ready to go ready to pay um so this was a very high cost he had to pay uh for this this land this Mount that would become of course uh the Temple Mount by God's grace so David paid it and then after he buys it verse 26 David built there an altar unto the Lord and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings and called upon the Lord I will just pause right there uh by God's grace two kinds of sacrifices David gives here uh burnt and peace offerings and just as a reminder of the five types of sacrifices in the Old Testament four of them were bloody one of them was not bloody uh the the sacrifice that was not bloody was the meal or meat offering and it also had a drink offering this was a sacrifice given for Thanksgiving for Provisions but the peace offering the sin offering the trespass offering and the burnt offering uh were offered with blood sacrifices just review those real briefly the burnt offering represented complete submission to God a rededication a total rededication to God uh that's what David did here so David was commanded by God he needed to give a burnt offering a total rededication back to God right he had failed he got tempted with pride no doubt to number the people and so he needed to rededicate his life to God not trust in man not trust in numbers but trust in the Living God as we're told not to trust in uncertain riches not to trust in Kings and leaders were're to pray for them but not trust in them or to trust in the Living God then David was told to give a peace offering which would be a a blood sacrifice as well and this was a sacrifice uh to give thanks for anything so it was a thanks Thanksgiving offering so this would be a gratitude offering here that the plague had been stopped a blood sacrifice uh in Thanksgiving that the plague had been stopped so those were the two um that David was commanded to offer and he offered it so uh there was two other kinds the sin offering was atonement for unintentional sins so notice this one wasn't um this one wasn't offered because uh it was more intentional right this wasn't an unintentional thing Israel you know needing to be chasen uh and and having 70,000 men killed uh that wasn't for unintentional it was for intentional then you have the trespass offering um this was atonement for intentional sins uh but the the level of sin that Israel must have been guilty of was such a high level that God called for the highest sacrifice the most sacred sacrifice uh which would have been the burn offering so God called for the burnt offering all right and so this represented total surrender to God the burnt offering God wanted his people totally surrendered separated from their idolatry and then uh finishing there verse 26 then God vindicates God accepts that offering so we can see how God accepted David's sacrifice but thank God God accepted the sacrifice of Jesus Christ because of course this is a forche shadowing David buying this purchasing this land as a type of God purchasing the whole world through the blood sacrifice of Jesus Christ and then God uh Vindicated Jesus's sacrifice right the sun wouldn't Shine for three hours uh the earthquake all the things that happened and then of course the resurrection um the Roman cenan saying truly this man was a Son of God God Vindicated it then of course he Vindicated with fire you know 50 days later on the day of panic praise God he Vindicated with the resurrection uh where the over 500 people saw Jesus at one time so of course God Vindicated Jesus's resurrection his death and Resurrection many many ways Allelujah so that was finishing verse 26 and then of course there's numerous other times God Vindicated sacrifices with literal fire uh it seems like from Hebrews 11 that God Vindicated Abel's sacrifice with fire and then of course turn down Cain's bloodless sacrifice because something has to die uh in order for God to vindicate a sacrifice uh there was at least three others so there's at least four uh sacrifices Vindicated by fire Gideon's sacrifice in judges 621 Gideon of course prepared the sacrifice on a rock instructed by the angel so again an instruction from an angel kind of like uh the angel instructed Gad to tell David the angel touched the offering with the tip of his staff and SP fire sprang up from the Rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread this was a sacrifice God Vindicated to prove to Gideon that he was to deliver them from the midnites but then remember he needed numerous other signs in order to give him the peace and the confidence to obey God so this shows us whatever we have need of God will give it to us in order to accomplish God's purpose in our life many of us I would say myself many of us some sometimes if God's calling us to do something great we need signs from God we need vindications from God if God's calling us to do something God works with Humanity uh God works with us whatever we have need of God will grant it to us just like Thomas needed to see the resurrected Christ uh whatever we have need of God will provide it for us so we can have faith and confidence uh that God's going to be with us and help us accomplish God's purpose in our life the next time was Elijah on Mount Carmel we'll get to this one here again in a little bit but um during his confrontation with the prophets of Baal Elijah prayed to God fire fell from heaven consuming his burnt offering the wood the stones even the water in the trench round about the altar remember Altar and remember Elijah did this by command so Elijah saw a vision in order to accomplish this that's why Elijah could mock the Bale prophets because he had already seen by Vision what God was going to do he already had thus sayith the Lord and then God consumed that remember that was to prove to Israel uh you can't go between two opinions either serve Baal or serve God and uh you know Elijah of course was standing there as God's Prophet at The Showdown and prove that God was with Elijah thank God God is with our Elijah God is with our Elijah uh the late Prophet brother William brandham Vindicated by the word of God by signs Miracles and wonders so we're thankful for that by the grace of God and then the the next one I'm talking about is uh the dedication of Solomon's Temple 2 Chronicles 7:1 at the dedication of the temple in Jerusalem fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices on the altar so much so that uh the priest couldn't even Minister that of course reminds us of when Moses dedicated the temple and then when Solomon D dedicated the temple God was so pleased with the sacrifice God was so pleased with the dwelling place he sent fire down to vindicate his sacrifice um you know we look for that as preachers you know I look for that uh in my life uh I want to see God bless uh you know uh my travels God God bless my Ministry there in akan God wherever God calls me you I always look for God to give a Vindication sometimes it's really wonderful pretty amazing other times it's just simple humble but we always look for God's Vindication Upon Our sacrifice so we appreciate that and we we thank we're thankful that God vindicates um uh what he's behind you know uh just as examples I went down to Kentucky this summer and Iowa and God truly Vindicated um that he had wanted me to go Minister there so I thank God for that of course we think of the Napoleon meetings there in April of 2023 uh how God vindicates uh times and seasons in our lives and to us that's our equivalent of fire falling from heaven where God God's spirit drops down and does wonderful Supernatural signs Miracles wonders the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit and we can all say praise the lord we were there I was there when the Spirit came Hallelujah so we're thankful for those moments that God has ordained in our life Hallelujah now just uh I did want to say something here getting back to the sin offering I just thought I might read this you know as I was uh as I Was preparing this sermon I had seen this note that I had about the sin offering um and it's been a while since I read this but uh if you uh want to listen to it's a very short there's a there's a sermon there's an audio recording called a private inter interview with sister Bruce and this interview sister Bruce Bruce has a heart condition she needs healing but she's also struggling with whether she's born again or not and so brother brandham uh counsels her it's a very short I think it's might even be just 10 minutes maybe less uh and while they're talking you can hear the congregation doing their song so brother BR sometimes would have private interviews right before he came out to preach and this is one of those times but as I was going through those offerings you know the burnt offering and the peace offering I was reminded this quote um and this is what brother Ram said about uh sister Bruce um I'll just read in paragraph five and six but before that uh brother Ram tells you know Sister Bruce Bruce kept saying I'm not worthy I'm not worthy I'm not worthy of God's healing I'm not I fail so much and brother Braham said think about me you know sis sister Bruce was just concerned about herself I'm not worthy about brother said think about me I'm not worthy he said alls I have to do is remember that Jesus uh called me to do this so I'm not trusting in my merits or my righteousness I'm just I have to remember in my mind I'm just following God's command and then God will honor us as we obey his commands and we stand in Jesus's stead brother R said I'm in the stead of Jesus what would I do if Jesus or what would Jesus do if he was here Jesus would lay hands on the sick right they'd recover like he did to Peter's stepmother or when he would cast out demons so brother Ram said you know I'm just as unworthy as you are sister Bruce uh but I'm just following Jesus's commands to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover um brother Ram said I believe you to be a genuine Christian woman sister Bruce says I make so many mistakes and I fail so many times I'm sure we can all relate to that we make so many mistakes we fail so many times brother Ram said that's why Christ had had to die so that you with your mistakes wouldn't be lotted to you see he took your mistakes your desire in your heart is to serve him sister Bruce said yes the ram said all right that's what he died for so you could serve him see your mistakes are not looked not lotted to you see he is your propit so he's your mercy seat right uh so the blood had to be placed on The Mercy Seat the the blood had to be on The Mercy Seat so the Judgment of God could be stopped brother said that's what Jesus is he's your mercy seat the wrath of God stops at Jesus so we don't we don't have to deal with God's Wrath because Jesus Paid for God's Wrath see brother man said he is your sin offering your sins are not known you're not a sinner before God remember like job God said job's a perfect man that was under the blood of bulls and goats how much more the New Testament believer Christ took your sins and became you or became he became sin Jesus did not become a sinner but he became sin because Jesus never sinned brother R plainly says that he says because your desire is to serve him so I just want to bring that in here you know no matter what condition we find ourselves in whether we're struggling or whether we're Victorious or uh if we feel like we're failing so many times remember Jesus is your sin offering so when we come to God we have to remember Jesus is our burnt offering our sin offering our trespass offering our drink offering our meal offering uh our burnt offering he is every offering he is our sacrifice right and we just come and we present ourselves we present our bodies as a Living Sacrifice Jesus is the true sacrifice to save us take all our sins away but then we lay ourselves on the on the sacrifice of God's or on the altar of God's sacrifice as well make ourselves a Living Sacrifice die to ourselves repent trust in God hallelujah and then we become a new creature our Minds get transformed I had a good question today from one of the Saints about can Satan uh know our can Satan read our minds and of course no Satan can't read our minds only the word is a discerner of the thoughts and tense of the heart and I thought this was excellent very excellent question um from one of the Saints there great question U but what we know is that Satan observes us right he uh he has divices he has traps lures plans like we've been reading there in the scripture so Satan you know and the demons can observe us and they can see what kind of state our our mind is in right they can see if we're overcoming or praising God uh but he can't he can't read our minds or read he can try to inject things into our minds but he can't know our every thought like God can God knows our thoughts but Satan can clearly see if our if you know through our words and everything uh if we're under the anointing of the Holy Spirit or the Bible said in Ephesians 4 neither give place place to the devil well where would where would a Christian give place to the devil in their mind or in their spirit so Satan or the demons can know if our mind is under the influence of an evil spirit like an unconfessed complex was an example I gave to one of the Saints on the text or any unconfessed sin if we've given place to the devil anywhere in our spirit well they can observe that they can't read our minds and our thoughts but they can clearly see okay wow this person this person is a Christian but uh they given over their conscience or their reason or their affection their imagination um they've given that over and another evil spirit has that place occupied so excellent question and so that's why we got to constantly uh confess our sins brother M said remember I plead constantly with the Lord Lord don't take your anointing off me brother Ram said I gotta I got to repent every hour he says why' he say that uh because the enemy right can see if we're giving into evil spirits or not or fighting the good fight of Faith or not he can see us through our up and downs and like that uh like like the saint asked there on on the text um you know it seems like when the enemy sees like we're we're down yes he'll try to influence other people uh to go to us and to to try to get us to fall deeper or get us to struggle more it seem like you know when it rains it pours you know uh when the enemy sees we're struggling then he'll s all these other things that try to discourage us so we have to cast down every imagination that exalts itself against the word of God and overcome the gates of hell and so the revelation of the holy spirit will overcome the gates of hell so excellent question I just thought I would share that there um no Satan cannot read our thoughts and our minds only the word can but the enemy can of course see if we've given over a place in our minds um to evil spirits or evil thoughts so great great question there by God's grace okay now verse 27 here 1 Chronicles 21:27 so we're just thankful God answers right you know sometimes we pray and we wonder when is God going to answer other times we pray and God answers right away here in David's case God answered by fire he called upon the name of the Lord and God answered by fire verse 27 and the Lord commanded the angel and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof so we get this picture of uh you know angels with swords and then putting the the sword away um this is a real picture right so we know there's angels that have six wings right there's angels with swords not all angels have swords but this is an angel with a sword and so God tells him it's enough put your sword away and the angel does that so the sword was not put away until uh the sacrifice was Vindicated from heaven so we get this idea you know sometimes troubles in our lives or tests in our lives are not going to stop until we really call on God really make a sacrifice right really devote ourselves unto God uh do we really want to be delivered from a complex do we really want our first love back it takes a real sacrifice especially if we've been giving into sin and Catering to the things of the world sinning uh living in any iniquity living in any unconfessed sin we have to give a real sacrifice a genuine sacrifice like the Bible says give a burnt offering Die daily um return to God we've been preaching on I will heal your back back slidings if we really want God's Vindication we got to give a real genuine consecrated sacrifice and be devoted unto God again Hallelujah the fear of the Lord we must hate evil depart from Evil and seek God then we'll understand the fear of the Lord again for our lives Hallelujah I like how all these recent messages are tied together uh by the grace of the Lord judgment cannot pass until the blood is shed and then God has received the the sacrifice that's verse 27 verse 28 at that time when David saw that the Lord had answered him in the threshing floor of ornan the jebusite then he sacrificed there okay so then he does continues to do sacrifices that became a very sacred spot for David because he'd heard about the 70,000 people dying and but when when he made that sacrifice when he drew nigh to God God Drew nigh to him and that place became uh a very special place of course still is to this day and forever will be eternally will be a special place God loves that place Mount Mariah Mount Zion uh Jerusalem the city of the great king that's the king's City Hallelujah so here we see uh this kind of reminds us you know of uh when when David wrote uh uh the psalm Psalm 51 you know after he'd s with basheba take not your Holy Spirit from me here we see that God accepts David Again David knew I he David could say yes I know God has accepted me God has accepted my sacrifice I'm back in fellowship with God he's forgiven Israel he's forgiven me of my pride of numbering the people and so this of course would have brought Joy back to David's life the joy of Salvation the joy of Victory the joy of his first Love U the renewal of the holy spirit in David's life so we see that verse 28 verse 29 for the Tabernacle of the Lord which Moses made in the wilderness and the altar of the burnt offering were at that season in the high place at gibian okay so we get this we get the reminder that um the burnt offerings sacrifices were done at gibian which if I'm not mistaken was north northwest of Jerusalem if I'm not mistaken I could be wrong on that um remember that from when I preached on the Joshua series um but uh David knew the sacrifices were done GI but here he sacrifices on the threshing floor or Mariah and God receives it okay but but he but he also knew that the sacrifices were to be done at Gian there verse 30 but David could not go before it to inquire of God for he was afraid because of the sword of the Angel Lord so here we get an understanding that David uh David was afraid to go to sacrifice at gibian because God had heard him right there uh and the angel of the Lord had met him there the prophet had told him to stay there so he didn't want to go anywhere to sacrifice he wanted to stay right there and continue to sacrifice do all his sacrifices right down there on Mariah because he knew God had has accepted in there he didn't know if God would accept him over there at gibian so he was afraid he was afraid of course seeing more people die who wouldn't be 70,000 people died 70,000 men died David didn't want to leave that place of worship he didn't want to leave Mariah he wanted to stay right there because he knew God accepted him there you we see that in our lives you know we want to stay where God accepts us right we don't want to leave position we don't want to leave uh where God's called us the gifts of the holy spirit in our lives you know we want to like brother Ben preached to us stay in your position you know we want to stay right there where God's called us to be uh and God will bless us uh when we stay there so we see David doing that David was afraid to leave because he didn't want to see any more men die he knew God had accepted him at Mariah he's going to stay right there he's not going to go to gibian he's going to stay right there and sacrifice all right so uh I'm at like about 54 minutes I'll go a few more minutes here by God's grace I thought you know as we're looking at Here Mount Zion you know we could look at the uh uh the three mountains or three showdowns brother brandom calls them Oh but before that yes David is David gets the fear of the Lord back so see he has this fear of the Lord right's he's not thinking I can go sacrifice anywhere he has the fear of the Lord he has this respect for God I'm going to sacrifice right here so again that tied in with how we looking at the fear of the Lord the last few Sunday nights at the church so David ends this story ends with David getting the fear of the Lord back okay so I want to um go back to the Mount Zion Showdown I just want to review this Lord willing you know Lord willing um I told you I want to get to the First Corinthians I do want to get to that eventually by God's grace but I'm having these other thoughts um and then i' like to get to um God in Simplicity God hiding himself in Simplicity revealing him the same according to song we've been preaching on and then the last one would be spoken words Original Seed well I thought this would tie nicely together as we're looking at Zion uh we look at um the three showdowns brother R taught us in in the spoken words Original Seed to be a good review as we uh as we approach that Lord willing so this is paragraph uh 432 spoken word Original Seed March 1862 brother man so it's at this time in this country that the person will appear for it's in the scripture and it's thus sayith the Lord so again anyone saying uh there there was a internet Prophet who actually lives in Ohio who who is saying he was um he was the Elijah to this day he it's just so so ridiculous um he's going against uh this quote right here because brother said it's it's it's it's happening at this time in this country brother bam also said that in anoint anointed ones of the end time 1965 he said uh the Elijah Prophet is in America right now brother Ram said so his ministry so this person uh brother Ram said was thus sayith the Lord in the country at that time then brother BR says in the latter Reign there will come forth a Mount Carmel a showdown Bible fulfilled to the letter John the Baptist his messenger before his face that's what John the Baptist was in Malachi 3 he said John the Baptist planted a former rain and was rejected by the churches the denominations the Pharisees and Sadducees in his day Jesus came and had the mount Transfiguration Showdown okay so now he's talking about two showdowns Mount Carmel with Elijah Mount Carmel the Old Testament and then Mount Transfiguration Jesus at a showdown with the religious people of of that day but with this one with Mount Transfiguration there's a forerunner John the Baptist and then there was Christ so now brother Ram takes this Mount Transfiguration with the Forerunner Elijah brother John the Baptist brother John the Baptist and then Jesus now he brings it to our day he calls it a Mount Zion Showdown the Forerunner would be brother brandham and then the coming of the of Christ would be next okay so we see this this Forerunner of the last days will sew or plant for the r latter rain just like John the John the Baptist planted for Jesus brother Brand's Ministry planted for the rapture Jesus will be the showdown between denominations and Creeds which is his word when he comes a showdown the Rapture of his bride I'll just pause right there I forgot to say this last Wednesday and Sunday but I don't know if anybody saw it but the pope uh came out last week and said every religion leads to God so that's this false doctrine of universalism um so this could take people in all kinds of crazy conspiracies but um it seems like uh the Pope here is saying that every religion leads to God no doubt I've seen the video he did say that he did say that but I'm what I was talking was referring to to some people's conspiracies about um you know how the Muslim faith perhaps came out of Catholicism it was set up by the Catholic church I don't know I'm not a conspiracy theorist a crazy one at all but um but the Bible does say every death every murder is accounted to the Roman Catholic Church in Roman or I'm sorry in Revelation chapter 18 so there has to be some truth to this um but anyways that point was uh not now the point I want to make is that the Pope I don't know if the pope really means that or not because there's a Council of Trent I made a video about that recently as well where the Council of Trent says um no one can be saved outside the Catholic church and the Council of Trent condemned Martin Luther's justification by faith so either the Pope doesn't agree with the Council of Trent which that wouldn't make sense or the pope is lying trying to deceive all these people to follow him to get him into the one world religion and of course that's what I believe um I believe the pope is just lying um not telling the the truth because he wouldn't go against the the tradition of the Catholic church it's even in their catechism um he wouldn't go against that so I just thought I'd share that if you hadn't seen that so this one world religion this uh this Unity of all the world's churches it's continuing of course it's going to only continue slowly it's just like a birth pain is going to slowly increase but just last week we had another sign of that where the pope is saying he's telling I think he was telling Hindus and other uh religions we're all the same religion so again thank God we've been warned thank God the Holy Ghost gave us thus sayi the Lord through brother brandham um that the Catholic Church rules at the end time according to Daniel's interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's dream and the iron and Clay is is the iron is Catholicism the clay is protestantism iron and clay in the feet of that statue so of course they're coming together more and more we're just going to see it more of course as uh the end continues to to draw nigh okay so I get back to the quote Jesus will be the showdown between the denominations and Creeds which is his word when he comes a showdown the Rapture of his bride okay so that's The Showdown is god with the Pope and all these churches or is there another group group that's the true bride of Jesus Christ well we know there's another group that's the true bride of Jesus Christ and they file a prophet of God brother William brandham who prophesy with thus sayith the Lord and again remember I got a video with at least six thus sayith the Lords that have come to pass a Vindicated true prophet of God so brother BR said the first was Mount Carmel that's the first Showdown three mountains right mount carel my mom's been there I haven't been there but my mom's been there the second was Mount Transfiguration my mom's been there um and the third will be Mount Zion now what's interesting is Mount Zion is just uh Zion is kind of like the old part of the city of Jerusalem here I guess there's an old and new part there but Mount Zion is kind of like the mountain to the west of Mount Mariah but they're very very close together and the Mount Mount of Olives is a little east of Mount Mariah um and but all of Jerusalem the all the the main mountains there are all called Zion just as one name so all three of those mounts uh kind of take the name Mount Zion so brother bah puts all those together and he says there's one more Showdown Mount Zion showdown of course this is the end of the Gentile dispensation the end of the times of the Gentiles there's a showdown between the denominations of course it'll be the Roman Catholic church and the uh the ecunemical move uh the worldwide economical move uh versus the true bride of Jesus Christ it's a showdown and Jesus is The Showdown who is Jesus really with well any church that breaks the word of God Jesus won't be with them he spewed them out of their mouth he's got to speak uh through the prophet the bride and the word right uh and the church right they'll all be saying the same thing brother brah said and what they have been said will already what they're saying will already have been said in the word of God that's why we believe every word of God hallelujah in the Bible we don't add one word to it we don't take one word away we only take the King James version uh because it has the full word of God no words taken away okay and so uh again we see the three showdowns Mount Carmel was a physical Mountain um Elijah was The Showdown with the the Bale denominations uh the second one was Mount Transfiguration a physical Mountain uh John the Baptist was the Forerunner who it was the former Reign rebuked organizations uh Jesus then would have been the latter reign of that The Showdown was was with the denominational spirit spirit and so for us Mount Zion is a physical Mount but it's also a spiritual Mount because Hebrews 12 tells us that we've already come to Mount Zion let's read that verse next here um we believe brother brandom was the Forerunner to this showdown he rebuked the organizations as well Jesus will be the latter rain rapturing Faith rapturing Grace we call it and to Showdown with denominations and Creeds okay so let's go to Hebrews 12 uh look at uh Zion to show how we've already come to that we've already come to uh the Heavenly Mount Zion in other words the Throne of God Hebrews 12:23 I'm sorry Hebrews 1222 but ye are come unto Mount Zion so we've already come to Mount Zion in one way we've other words the Throne of God right now Mount Zion is in heaven it's the Throne of Jesus Christ um but for the Rapture Jesus comes down and that's The Showdown he's coming down he's going to show who is the true bride of Jesus Christ right then the fire is going to fall life is going to swallow up uh the Believers right life is going to swallow up death our bod is are going to be changed we're going to go to meet him in the air Hallelujah that's the fire of The Showdown but we are come right now to Mount Zion unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem to an innumerable company of angels see because we're already in touch with the high priest Jesus Christ in heaven we've already come to Mount Zion but then uh Jesus Christ is coming down and so it's another Mount Zion Showdown and we can even say it like this it's the Mount Zion Showdown because the true bride will live with Jesus in the New Jerusalem the Heavenly Jerusalem right that's come down to earth Hallelujah and of course minister to Jesus there in the millennial Temple but also the holy city the future home the New Jerusalem it's a showdown to see who the true bride of Jesus Christ is and by God's grace will be there uh by the grace of almighty God because we live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God not a church Creed not a church bylaw our Creed is Christ the word hallelujah all right and then I think I'll close with this there's uh I preached this a couple years ago but there's five reasons David taking Zion which was led through joab types the Rapture I don't know if you remember this or not I'd forgotten about it I can't remember everything but that's why I'm glad I got these notes to go back and reference um five reasons David taking uh Zion types the Rapture it was a total time of unity um the unity of David's time was the same Unity as the beginning when uh Joshua's group was unified all 12 tribes were were United around David and we get that Unity according to the fivefold ministry in Ephesians 43 I'm sorry Ephesians 4:14 till we all come in the unity of the faith Hallelujah uh second it was defeating the Invincible stronghold at The Showdown David was was even mocked by the jebusites remember they said oh even a blind man could protect this Fortress we're so fortified um taking Jerusalem stronghold types the Holy Ghost filled Church conquering The Last Enemy death which has been a stronghold since the church was born death is swallowed up in Victory death is swallowed up in life so that's the second reason uh David taking Zion types the Rapture death is swalled up in life third the king didn't take the city but his wisdom through his servants did so David himself did not conquer the city joab did by using David's wisdom uh Jesus jesus' physical body doesn't defeat The Last Enemy uh for the Rapture but jesus' spirit his church defeats The Last Enemy because the bride has made herself ready so again a beautiful type there um Jesus comes out to meet us in the air but it's the Holy Spirit they in the church uh death is swallowed up in life Hallelujah and so the Servants of God uh have the spirit of the king Hallelujah D joab had the spirit of David right uh the leadership of David we have the leadership of the Holy Ghost to conquer death Hallelujah of course that's rapturing Faith that's a latter rain verse four this uh the secret to Victory joab took the stronghold through a secret passage the bride will have the secret things according to Deuteronomy 29:29 including the finished mystery of God Revelation 10:7 also secret prayer fasting giving of alms Matthew 6 vers 46 and 18 John had to go take the little book and Jesus said we have to take the kingdom by force we have to actually uh go do these commands we're supposed to go fast go go pray go give alms we're supposed to take those and do them not just hearers only uh of the word of God but doers of the word of God so we have the secret to Victory just like joab had it and Fifth and finally um the victory ushered in the physical reign of the king priest so when David brought the Ark of the presence of God into Jerusalem after the unity and the defeat of the jebusites the visible shakina of Glory presence of Christ come comes into the church after the unity uh and the Rapture Hallelujah so that we get to live in the spiritual presence or the physical presence of Jesus Christ the King and priest and the Bible said we will be ever with the Lord amen so the victory ushers in US physically being with the King priest Hallelujah okay so I think we'll stop right there by God's grace we've been a little over an hour there uh was Malachi to come we'll close with a song here and a word of prayer hope that was a blessing here tonight Saints by the grace of God I know if you're like me uh you're you're longing for this uh rapture we don't know the day or hour um just Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus here tonight and uh I love how these uh stories like David gives us so much Revelation on so many topics right all the way from the the anger of God kindled to the fear of the Lord to sacrifice of of giving yourself as a a Living Sacrifice un God getting your first love back and then the Rapture and then Mount Mariah the New Jerusalem the Heavenly Jerusalem the Millennium uh all these thoughts tied in together here just in one simple Bible passage so we're thankful uh God's word is eternal God's word is so deep and Rich uh can never get to the bottom of it it's such a blessing uh to hear the word of God and of course do the word of God let's pray that tonight that we'll be doers of the word joab had to go take the city we've got to take the word of God we've got to possess the kingdom of God the violent take it by force as we looked at that harpazo we got to go snatch those promises we have to do the word of God believe the word of God so let's pray and God will help us to do this word that we love so much father God in heaven we thank you for tonight Lord God we turn our eyes upon you tonight Lord God father help us to go lay our hands on the sick and
