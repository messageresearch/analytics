[41:49] thence to Philip I which is the chief
[41:51] city of that part of Macedonia and a
[41:54] colony and we were in that city abiding
[41:57] certain days all right let's go to
[42:00] Philippians four seven and eight this is
[42:06] a really good scripture to meta to use
[42:08] for meditation during this you know
[42:10] strange time of this coronavirus what a
[42:13] very fitting scripture we always need to
[42:15] meditate on the things that are true
[42:17] holy honest just a good report there's
[42:21] any praise those are the things we
[42:24] should be meditating on at this time
[42:26] amen thank God first word clip Ian's
[42:30] four seven and eight let's read that
[42:31] together verse seven on three one two
[42:34] three and the peace of God which passeth
[42:38] all understanding shall keep your hearts
[42:40] and minds through Christ Jesus finally
[42:45] brethren whatsoever things are true
[42:47] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[42:51] things are just whatsoever things are
[42:55] pure whatsoever things are lovely
[42:58] whatsoever things are of good report if
[43:01] there be any virtue and if there be any
[43:05] praise think on these things Eamon let's
[43:08] think on those and let's bow our heads
[43:10] here as we pray if you have a need on
[43:11] your heart let's just make it known unto
[43:13] the Lord here Heavenly Father we love
[43:16] you we thank you for today
[43:17] Lord we read your word we've sang your
[43:19] songs and Lord now it's time for the
[43:21] word of God to be preached we know Lord
[43:23] the scripture says faith comes by
[43:25] hearing so lord help us to hear Lord
[43:28] what your word says today used me as a
[43:31] vessel may I be fully unit and
[43:32] surrendered to you and may every heart
[43:35] be hungry for your word and be yielded
[43:37] and surrendered to Lord what you're
[43:39] speaking to us including me Lord all of
[43:41] us need
[43:42] a portion today daily bread all of us
[43:45] need further anointing of your Holy
[43:48] Spirit so Lord quicken the word to our
[43:50] hearts Lord make it live nor we know the
[43:52] word is powerful and active and alive
[43:55] Lord God and man do a great work in our
[43:57] lives today speak to us in our needs
[43:59] Lord and our so maybe some of us are on
[44:02] mountaintops other us others in valleys
[44:04] Lord may administer to each and every
[44:06] person today father and Lord we know
[44:08] that you're interested in the individual
[44:10] every detail you're interested in so
[44:13] father just show us Lord your truth
[44:15] today and Lord we just ask your spirit
[44:17] to move amongst us here in Jesus
[44:19] Christ's name everybody said amen god
[44:22] bless yous being seated praise God
[44:23] praise the Lord we're thankful for God's
[44:35] word today and trust that we'll be able
[44:36] to speak something that the Lord will
[44:39] take and bless to our hearts and I
[44:41] believe he will so let's start let's go
[44:45] back to x16 I like to start there before
[44:47] we get into Philippians chapter 1 I like
[44:51] the Lord willing get to flipping chapter
[44:53] 1 today and begin looking at some of
[44:55] these scriptures here Paul is writing
[44:59] last Sunday we looked at the great work
[45:02] that God started there in Philippi and
[45:06] we've kind of looked at the background
[45:07] of it and also saw a little bit how
[45:11] brother Branham continued the apostolic
[45:14] pattern that Paul started there was no
[45:16] greater missionary than Paul outside of
[45:18] Christ and the way Paul started he would
[45:21] go into a city of course he had to be
[45:23] led by the Holy Spirit he had to be led
[45:25] to a place he tried to go to Asia the
[45:28] Holy Spirit forbade him so he went
[45:30] somewhere else and then wherever he went
[45:33] then God would there be Souls ready to
[45:34] hear him because God will never send
[45:37] anybody someplace unless he's got a
[45:38] purpose for it praise God and like the
[45:41] Bible says if God gives you a gift he's
[45:43] gonna open up a room for you to use that
[45:46] gift praise God Amen thank the Lord for
[45:49] that
[45:50] and so God had a soul he had souls there
[45:52] in Philippi and so Paul went there he
[45:55] let felt led by the holy
[45:56] spirit and he just said well it's time
[45:58] to pray I'm just gonna go down to the
[45:59] river to pray and he found a little
[46:02] woman there named Lydia and the Bible
[46:04] said the Lord opened her heart praise
[46:06] God and then threw her Lydia's life and
[46:10] her home opening up this church sprang
[46:12] up and then Paul we know other things
[46:15] happen we'll read those today but then
[46:17] he leaves and then 11 years later he
[46:19] writes this letter here to minister to
[46:22] the Philippians but now let's go back
[46:25] here to acts 16 we started at verse 12
[46:28] and let's see again how this church
[46:30] starts it's such a beautiful encouraging
[46:34] portion of scripture to see how God
[46:38] started it now we read verse 12 and then
[46:42] verse 13 14 and 15 is what the Lord does
[46:46] in the life of Lydia the first European
[46:49] convert I just love that idea of the
[46:53] Lord opened her heart who opened your
[46:56] heart the Lord opened your heart praise
[46:58] God the Bible said that God starts the
[47:01] work praise God and just like God you
[47:04] know that when the earth was with dark
[47:06] without form and void what what started
[47:09] it God started it by sending his Holy
[47:11] Spirit to hover over the darkness praise
[47:14] God and out of that darkness came forth
[47:17] life praise God and that's what we see
[47:19] what God does God God finds us
[47:22] he leaves the 99 right he searches out
[47:24] the one and so God searches out Lydia
[47:27] and her house and God starts a work God
[47:30] opens it up you know the Bible said the
[47:33] goodness of God leads us to repentance
[47:34] praise God and so God starts it that way
[47:37] he does something good praise God he he
[47:40] he starts he he gets our attention and
[47:43] he starts trying to get our hearts to
[47:45] see His grace and His mercy and through
[47:49] His grace and His goodness we opened the
[47:51] hearts praise God we open our hearts to
[47:53] God and we receive God as we saw
[47:55] Wednesday every decision we make is
[47:58] based upon love it's either our love for
[48:01] God or the love for the things of the
[48:02] world right it's all based upon love
[48:05] jesus said the condemnation came to them
[48:07] because they love darkness more than
[48:09] they love light
[48:10] but then God says the greatest
[48:12] commandment is to love the Lord thy God
[48:14] with all thine heart and with all I so
[48:17] Eva how do I hear today by your love for
[48:21] God Amon that's why I'm here because of
[48:23] my love for God because God has showed
[48:26] his love to us amen through the cross of
[48:30] Jesus Christ now here he sits down and
[48:35] for this Sabbath day prayer meeting and
[48:37] Lydia hears the word and then she opens
[48:41] her heart and then when her hearts open
[48:43] her house opens I love that praise God
[48:45] when your heart really opens your whole
[48:48] life is open to God Lord ma you can use
[48:51] my house you can use my voice you can
[48:54] use everything use my car you use all of
[48:57] me Lord you use everything of me because
[49:00] you've opened my heart now my whole life
[49:02] is open for you praise God Lord used me
[49:06] whatever you'd have my life to
[49:08] accomplish use me praise God we don't
[49:11] want to close our lives up you know
[49:13] that's the temptation of where Satan
[49:15] wants to get people today through
[49:17] depression and you know they are other
[49:20] discouragements you know there will be
[49:21] discouragements in our lives and we have
[49:23] a choice and some people choose to close
[49:25] themselves up and and get discouraged
[49:28] and and isolate themselves that's just
[49:30] what Satan once he wants people to be
[49:32] closed up but we have to open our hearts
[49:34] praise God we have to open our minds to
[49:37] the things of God and not shut it down
[49:39] and try to keep the thing of God out
[49:41] we've got to open up the doors right if
[49:44] you want your house clean you know of
[49:46] natural open up the windows praise God
[49:48] it let the fresh air come in praise God
[49:51] open it up and we got to open up our
[49:53] will is what needs to be opened up
[49:56] praise God Lord I'm willing to do your
[49:58] your I'm willing to hear your word I'm
[50:01] willing to give it another chance praise
[50:03] God I'm willing to to change my life I
[50:06] know something needs to change and I'm
[50:08] willing to open up to you and let your
[50:10] word bring life to my life amen praise
[50:14] God
[50:14] and so she had an open heart which
[50:16] produced an open house praise God
[50:19] Amen now we go look to the next
[50:22] scripture here mercy
[50:24] sixteen now see paw doesn't change his
[50:29] his routine his routine is pray on the
[50:32] Sabbath pray preach let God open
[50:35] people's hearts praise God one at a time
[50:38] amen one at a time that's all we are
[50:41] today every church is like that you keep
[50:43] preaching you keep being faithful to God
[50:45] he'll open up one heart at a time praise
[50:48] the Lord and that's over sixteen and it
[50:51] came to pass as we went to prayer see he
[50:54] does the same thing he knows I've gotten
[50:57] to be devoted to prayer I've got to just
[50:59] keep doing what God's calling us to do
[51:01] God calls us to assemble let's just keep
[51:03] assembling praise God let's keep praying
[51:05] hallelujah and then the Bible sent a
[51:08] certain damsel possessed with the spirit
[51:11] of divination Metis which brought her
[51:13] master's much gain by sue saying the
[51:18] same followed Paul and us and cried
[51:22] saying these men are the servants of the
[51:24] Most High God which show unto us the way
[51:26] of salvation then that striking a
[51:29] demon-possessed woman will follow the
[51:31] man of God the Bible said she followed
[51:34] us this should remind us of the maniac
[51:37] of gaturro right he was full of demons
[51:41] but yet he kept being came he came
[51:43] running to Jesus and brother man tells
[51:46] us why because there was a part of him
[51:48] that wouldn't be free from those demons
[51:51] so see Church there's times and if
[51:53] demon-possessed people or people having
[51:55] trouble around us there's a reason
[51:58] they're around us
[51:58] it's because something in their hearts
[52:00] desires to be saved amen and so that's
[52:04] why just like the maniac he wanted to be
[52:06] free and so Jesus could set him free now
[52:09] touch you know we know this that program
[52:11] says and we know in the scripture a
[52:14] person can't be delivered from demons
[52:16] unless they want to be delivered right
[52:19] they have to want to do it because that
[52:22] demon has possessed their house they've
[52:24] given over their house and the spoils
[52:28] they've given it over to the enemy and
[52:30] so this woman is demon-possessed but
[52:32] there's something a part of her that
[52:34] wants to be free amen
[52:37] so she follows the man
[52:38] God and so the demon-possessed people
[52:41] are she's following the true man of God
[52:44] saying he's a true man of God amen
[52:48] I like that you know when you know we
[52:49] know there's just church members and
[52:50] they don't believe in the things of God
[52:52] but I like how they can look at us they
[52:54] can look at you and say well I'm not
[52:56] sure you know there's a lot of people
[52:58] out there but I know one person that's a
[53:00] Christian that's brother Jose praise God
[53:02] amen they could recognize that you're a
[53:05] true you're a true Christian praise God
[53:07] I don't know many like there's a sister
[53:10] that lives out in Columbus and she put
[53:11] on Facebook a few years ago she said she
[53:14] said I know she said there's one person
[53:15] that's gonna make it
[53:16] it's brother Jesse and she talked about
[53:18] the rapture and that made me feel good
[53:21] because she's left a message she was
[53:22] raising the message left the message but
[53:25] she put that little comment on there
[53:26] she's like if one person's gonna make it
[53:28] it's gonna be brother Jesse and his
[53:29] family of course that we know we don't
[53:32] know that but I believe that I'm gonna
[53:35] be one amongst the many that make it
[53:37] praise God or he say the few but I'm for
[53:40] us as many but I like that when people
[53:43] can look at our lives and they can say
[53:44] if someone's gonna make it it's gonna be
[53:46] them because they love the Lord and so
[53:49] that's what and of course yeah this
[53:51] woman cuts her hair now she wears pants
[53:52] and she was makeup she was raised the
[53:55] message but left it but they can still
[53:57] see the love of God I like that and she
[54:01] wanted to be free and she said they're
[54:03] the servants of the Most High God I
[54:04] don't think I ever told this testimony
[54:06] but my wife would told me years ago even
[54:08] when she was a sinner growing up as a
[54:11] teenager one of her friend's mother's
[54:14] saw a halo or light not maybe not a halo
[54:17] off to ask my wife after servers but
[54:19] there's a light there was an anointing
[54:20] or aura that rested over my wife that's
[54:24] pretty awesome
[54:25] praise God even as a teenager and she
[54:28] cut her hair and wore makeup and didn't
[54:30] know the message never even heard of the
[54:31] message that whole time this this mother
[54:34] of one of her friends said did you know
[54:36] you have a spirit over you and my wife
[54:40] was I got in understand it till now
[54:42] Ray's got just like brother Brad before
[54:45] he was a Christian ever on the bus with
[54:46] that demon-possessed
[54:47] she said you're born under a sign and he
[54:50] said no no we're we talking about that
[54:52] Rodan was like he was like lines and the
[54:55] woman Loran was lying to the woman on
[54:58] the bus no no no no I'm gonna oh there's
[55:01] nothing special about me see God in
[55:07] other words God knows them better his
[55:09] praise God you're what you're a child of
[55:11] God amen and you always were a child of
[55:15] God hallelujah and you keep serving God
[55:18] you the longer you serve God the more
[55:20] you'll be convinced that you're a child
[55:22] of God no matter if other people want to
[55:24] fall away or what they want to do you
[55:26] know there's something different about
[55:27] you you love God and you're gonna serve
[55:29] God and there's an anointing on you
[55:31] that's just going to be greater than
[55:32] other people because of God's grace amen
[55:35] because you love God amen and you you
[55:38] want to obey God and you want to serve
[55:40] God and you want to be a part of the
[55:42] rapture praise God you want to go to
[55:44] heaven you were to walk those pearly
[55:45] gates and you want to be in the presence
[55:48] of Jesus Christ and cast your crown at
[55:50] his feet praise God you were there
[55:53] something about you right just like with
[55:55] my wife there was something about her
[55:56] you know it's funny about what my mother
[55:59] made all these jokes when my wife and I
[56:00] started dating in high school my I guess
[56:03] my wife or my mother told Kristen before
[56:05] we were date you know before your
[56:07] marriage
[56:07] she's like Jesse changed girlfriends
[56:09] like t-shirts weather and you know we
[56:12] just did little boy girlfriend stuff
[56:14] nothing you know nothing real serious
[56:16] anything like that I just you know what
[56:18] I don't like you anymore I like you I
[56:19] don't like you anymore
[56:20] but there's something when I met Kristen
[56:22] I just couldn't I could never do that I
[56:24] could never I just was like tied to her
[56:26] you know it's because the Bible says
[56:28] that the woman is a part of the man
[56:30] praise God Eve was part of Adam praise
[56:34] God and like brother says if you didn't
[56:36] get the right one over here you'll get
[56:37] the right one over there understand that
[56:41] but there has to be a truth because Eve
[56:44] came out of Adam praise God
[56:46] and so there's there something about you
[56:49] you know and even in the newspaper even
[56:51] the newspaper when I was a senior I
[56:52] wasn't even Christian I finished I
[56:55] graduated high school and the man the
[56:57] newspaper writer said there was only one
[56:59] this word to describe Jesse Smith
[57:01] special he said and I can look back now
[57:04] and I can see why did
[57:06] why was that because God had something
[57:08] all my life praise God
[57:10] there was a call just like Paul before
[57:12] he became Paul he had such a zeal but
[57:15] it's for the zeal for the wrong thing
[57:17] but everybody can see he's he's really
[57:20] gifted here he's good he's really
[57:22] zealous but he just had the wrong zeal
[57:25] but once he met that light praise God
[57:27] amen
[57:28] he was able to walk in obedience to the
[57:30] true Word of God and now have zeal for
[57:33] Christ amen
[57:35] see people there's something about your
[57:37] life that God has upon your life praise
[57:40] God and so this woman can see he's a man
[57:43] of God now Church thing about that all
[57:45] those millions of people they're walking
[57:47] around Phillipi and there's one and
[57:50] everybody else is just going about their
[57:51] business and doing their Roman business
[57:53] and everything like that but there's one
[57:55] demon-possessed woman said he's a real
[57:56] servant of God he's and he he's just got
[57:59] a real small church he's just got a real
[58:01] small message Church nothing big has
[58:05] happened yet all she did was going
[58:06] preach at a prayer meeting and Lydia
[58:08] opened up her house that's all he's got
[58:10] is one house right now a very small
[58:13] message church and yet all this time you
[58:16] know this woman is after him and we know
[58:18] the story how it goes on and the Bible
[58:20] said she did this many days and Paul
[58:25] being grieved turned and said to the
[58:27] spirit I command thee in the name of
[58:29] Jesus Christ to come out of her and he
[58:32] came out the same hour praise God what a
[58:36] beautiful story this fortune-telling
[58:38] devil was anointing this woman and she
[58:42] was being used like a slave right she
[58:46] was being used like a slave and she was
[58:50] able to contact evil spirits and and
[58:52] guess fortunes and make them lots of
[58:55] money it was a and this was obviously a
[58:57] big hub of sorcery and witchcraft and
[59:03] yet she didn't want to be a slave
[59:06] because Paul could not have cast like we
[59:08] can't force people to be saved right
[59:10] we can't force demons to move we have no
[59:12] power but we do have a thority praise
[59:14] God but even with this Authority it's
[59:17] got to be in the timing of God
[59:19] and it has to be that person's will to
[59:22] be free from the demons praise God I
[59:26] love this here Paul he's greed many days
[59:32] and brother man uses his Scripture and
[59:34] the prisoner sermon he said a prisoner
[59:37] of Christ Paul couldn't cast it out when
[59:40] he wanted to he had to wait for the tiny
[59:42] of God and church that's where we get
[59:44] discouraged we read the Bible and see
[59:46] all these miracles and we just want to
[59:48] do a miracle now don't know about you
[59:49] but that's how I feel many times I just
[59:51] want to see a miracle now but God is
[59:53] going to teach us it's not in our time
[59:55] it's in his time it's not by our work or
[59:59] our power but it's by his leadership and
[1:00:03] his anointing praise God as that's the
[1:00:06] same thing pause he's already learned
[1:00:08] that he said I can't do anything he said
[1:00:10] but he waited to the Holy Spirit
[1:00:11] anointed him and he commanded in the
[1:00:13] name of the Father Son Holy Ghost come
[1:00:16] out of her no you know didn't do that in
[1:00:20] the name of the son come out of her no
[1:00:22] sir he said in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:00:24] amen and that's the name praise God
[1:00:28] that's the name that causes Devils to
[1:00:30] tremble praise God I remember when I
[1:00:32] first cast out those demons on those
[1:00:34] women I first asked him I said do you
[1:00:36] want to be free and they said yes and as
[1:00:38] soon as I grabbed her hand and I said
[1:00:40] Satan I come against you by the blood of
[1:00:42] Jesus Christ as soon as I said the blood
[1:00:44] of Jesus Christ she started shaking like
[1:00:46] that and I said oh my so I just kept
[1:00:48] praying praying and said to the name of
[1:00:50] Jesus Christ come out and after a little
[1:00:52] bit of fighting and testing and polling
[1:00:54] she let out a big scream and fell down
[1:00:56] as one dead but I noticed when I started
[1:00:59] when I started claiming the blood of
[1:01:01] Jesus Christ amen that spirit knew it
[1:01:05] was going to go praise God because the
[1:01:08] blood purchased this person's soul
[1:01:11] praise God amen
[1:01:13] the blood paid the price for this
[1:01:16] person's deliverance amen that blood
[1:01:19] paid the price and her forgiveness and
[1:01:21] that means she doesn't have to be a
[1:01:23] slave sinner shall no longer have
[1:01:26] dominion over you praise God amen
[1:01:28] I know yeah they were by they were in
[1:01:31] bondage to sin before
[1:01:33] brother of Jesus Christ many times but
[1:01:35] Jesus Christ blood cream to separate us
[1:01:38] from our sins amen thank the Lord
[1:01:42] and he came out that same hour praise
[1:01:45] God
[1:01:46] oh I love it the power of the Holy
[1:01:49] Spirit
[1:01:49] and like I told you here at our church
[1:01:51] like I said a few years ago I went back
[1:01:53] to word there were low seats and I said
[1:01:55] in the name of Jesus Christ I commend
[1:01:57] that spirit to leave 11 days later that
[1:01:59] spirit left the church what do we have
[1:02:02] to do we have to wait till we're led of
[1:02:04] the Lord to speak God's Word amen
[1:02:07] we got to be patient enough we got to be
[1:02:10] godly enough we got to be in tune with
[1:02:12] God through prayer enough so that we at
[1:02:16] the time we say it is the right time to
[1:02:18] say it praise God that's it that's the
[1:02:22] reason you know things maybe don't
[1:02:23] happen when when they should is because
[1:02:25] we're kind of late on it all right or
[1:02:27] maybe we're not in touch with the Holy
[1:02:29] Spirit but we got to be in touch with
[1:02:31] the Holy Spirit praise God we have to do
[1:02:33] that by the grace of the Lord that's why
[1:02:36] I'm encouraged with who is dad getting
[1:02:38] better because he wasn't talking at
[1:02:40] first and I just I had that spirit that
[1:02:42] a scripture come to me there's power of
[1:02:45] life in the tongue praise God and we
[1:02:49] just got to keep speaking God's Word
[1:02:50] amen look for the regrets that you gotta
[1:02:52] look for the spirit how its leading you
[1:02:54] at that time he men you see God's not
[1:02:57] just out there God's with us right now
[1:02:59] praise God he wants to be with us right
[1:03:02] now he wants to be amongst us he wants
[1:03:04] to be caught on the scene praise God
[1:03:06] he's doing something for us praise the
[1:03:09] Lord see God doesn't need devils to
[1:03:13] witness for him but sometimes that he he
[1:03:16] uses it sometimes he uses it
[1:03:19] ah the member James said even the demons
[1:03:25] believe and they tremble at the name of
[1:03:27] Jesus Church you and I we just got to
[1:03:30] speak that name of Jesus in our homes
[1:03:32] speak it on the job in the name of Jesus
[1:03:35] in the name of Jesus before you call
[1:03:37] somebody gotta talk do you speak the
[1:03:39] name of Jesus it will cause those demons
[1:03:41] to move amen that's the power in the
[1:03:46] name demon
[1:03:47] have to tremble at the name of Jesus
[1:03:49] Christ praise God now let's just speak
[1:03:56] it and let's go forward why cry speak
[1:03:58] right God told Moses don't stop don't
[1:04:01] stop he said just speak the word he had
[1:04:05] to wait to get the word of the Lord once
[1:04:06] he got the word Lord the word of Lord
[1:04:08] said speak and go forward amen and many
[1:04:12] times that's what will do it which is a
[1:04:13] good thing we should stop and get the
[1:04:15] word of the Lord speak the word Lord and
[1:04:18] then move on in faith with with God's
[1:04:21] Word
[1:04:22] hallelujah now look at he says here now
[1:04:28] verse 19 and when her master saw that
[1:04:30] the hope of the gains was gone
[1:04:31] they caught Paul and Silas and drew them
[1:04:34] in the market under the rulers and
[1:04:35] brought them to the magistrate saying
[1:04:38] these men being Jews do exceedingly
[1:04:40] trouble our city and teach customs which
[1:04:44] are not lawful for us to receive neither
[1:04:45] to observe being Romans now why they're
[1:04:48] doing this because they lost their money
[1:04:49] why do people many times attack
[1:04:52] Christians because they lose their
[1:04:54] benefits right it's all selfishly
[1:04:57] motivated if someone's attacking you
[1:04:59] it's because they got the wrong
[1:05:01] motivation praise God their motivation
[1:05:05] is we lost our money so I'm gonna take
[1:05:07] it out on these guys Church many times
[1:05:11] people attack you because they like
[1:05:14] something that you got that's right they
[1:05:18] don't know how to get it so they attack
[1:05:20] the real man or woman of God that's
[1:05:24] right look at them attack him now verse
[1:05:28] 22 and the multitude rose up together
[1:05:30] against them and the magistrates rent
[1:05:31] off their clothes and commanded to beat
[1:05:33] them and when they laid many stripes
[1:05:35] upon them they cast them into prison
[1:05:37] charging the jailer to keep them safely
[1:05:39] who having received such a charge thrust
[1:05:42] them in the inner prison and made their
[1:05:44] feet fast in the stocks
[1:05:47] I see people might have been discouraged
[1:05:50] right they might have been discouraged
[1:05:52] oh we just saved a few souls and we just
[1:05:54] cast out a demon but now we're in prison
[1:05:56] and church they had every right they
[1:05:59] could have acted at every
[1:06:00] right to be discouraged or down and
[1:06:02] defeated but God was gonna do a great
[1:06:04] shaking in this prison house praise God
[1:06:07] God was going to do a great thing and
[1:06:09] God was going to show this city that he
[1:06:12] was God amen this is a city that's given
[1:06:15] over to demons and God was going to
[1:06:17] shake this place and give them a chance
[1:06:19] my I think about a church as I said you
[1:06:21] can go there today and you can see the
[1:06:23] ruins of this city of that part of the
[1:06:26] city rather now the modern part moved
[1:06:28] but you can go back and God was going to
[1:06:31] give that generation a chance to hear
[1:06:33] the word of God amen and God is giving
[1:06:36] this city a chance to hear his word amen
[1:06:39] everywhere he goes any time God does
[1:06:41] something great any time God's Spirit is
[1:06:43] moving he's trying to shake the city
[1:06:46] praise God
[1:06:47] he's trying to give that generation a
[1:06:49] chance to hear God's Word I'm glad I
[1:06:52] heard it praise God amen that's what I
[1:06:57] believe with you know that the city the
[1:06:59] the the town I was raised in they will
[1:07:01] have no excuses on the day of judgment
[1:07:02] because God healed my momma cancer in
[1:07:04] that city they'll have no excuses and
[1:07:07] then can my brother camps are that
[1:07:08] Church there's just a 5-10 minutes away
[1:07:10] there they have no excuses on the day of
[1:07:12] judgment cuz that and then my mother for
[1:07:15] the last 25 years she has fed the poor
[1:07:18] every Christmas Thanksgiving and Easter
[1:07:21] she's fed the poor sometimes two hundred
[1:07:24] meals on each of those days that's six
[1:07:26] hundred meals in a year
[1:07:27] now I'm no excuse on that day that there
[1:07:30] wasn't a living God and God doesn't heal
[1:07:32] we never heard the word now no excuses
[1:07:36] praise God and so it's our duty now to
[1:07:38] live such a godly life at this town and
[1:07:41] our families have to witness that there
[1:07:43] is a Living God amen we don't know how
[1:07:46] God's going to do that God might heal
[1:07:48] someone of us of cancer God might do so
[1:07:50] you might raise somebody from the dead
[1:07:52] we don't know but we got to faithfully
[1:07:54] serve God until God gives the witness
[1:07:56] and gives this generation an opportunity
[1:07:59] to receive his word because the Bible
[1:08:02] said he's never left himself without a
[1:08:04] witness amen praise God now that we got
[1:08:07] to say like this there might be a five
[1:08:08] talent witness among us there might be a
[1:08:11] two talent witness among us there might
[1:08:13] just be a one Talent
[1:08:14] witness among us but whenever tale he's
[1:08:16] given to us let's invest in it with all
[1:08:18] of our hearts and bring for double
[1:08:21] let's bring forth fruit unto the Lord
[1:08:23] praise God right because not every town
[1:08:27] had a Paul right now he would he was a
[1:08:29] special man he was one of the seven
[1:08:30] stars in the hand of Christ Paul are all
[1:08:33] the gifts of the Spirit all the
[1:08:34] preaching gifts he had all of them and
[1:08:36] he did these great mighty miracles and
[1:08:38] not everybody of course would be on his
[1:08:40] level but God leaves a witness in every
[1:08:43] generation and we must be those
[1:08:45] witnesses and look what they did they
[1:08:50] cast him into the prison I like this my
[1:08:52] verse 25 and that midnight Paul and
[1:08:55] Silas prayed and sang praises unto God
[1:08:59] and the prisoners heard them there's
[1:09:01] only one time I was up all night with
[1:09:03] sickness in that and I tried I prayed it
[1:09:05] off and on that night all night I had
[1:09:08] what was it strep throat that's the
[1:09:11] that's the day I passed out at the other
[1:09:12] church remember that Lydia I passed out
[1:09:15] and John had to preach it uh I tried to
[1:09:18] curse that strep throat all night I
[1:09:20] didn't know what it was till later and I
[1:09:22] tried to God send me a vision I want to
[1:09:24] see angels and I didn't feel nothing all
[1:09:26] night but I tried I pressed through with
[1:09:31] all and I tried singing I tried
[1:09:32] everything and I I felt a little better
[1:09:34] than the mornings that's where I got
[1:09:35] dressing so I was gonna go preach it I'm
[1:09:37] gonna try to just trust God but see I
[1:09:42] didn't have enough saith the Lord but
[1:09:45] that's one time when I tried to pray
[1:09:46] through the night as I woke up and in
[1:09:48] and out of fever and trying to sing and
[1:09:52] I asked God for a vision I asked God to
[1:09:54] heal me it didn't come that way but it
[1:09:57] didn't discourage me I mean I was so
[1:10:00] disappointed I didn't get healed I tried
[1:10:01] I really cried out to God but that
[1:10:04] wasn't God's call for that time and then
[1:10:06] I've had other times I told you before I
[1:10:07] felt like I was going to throw up you
[1:10:10] know on a Sunday night it's happened to
[1:10:11] numerous times and I got I thought oh I
[1:10:14] got to work tomorrow I've gone down to
[1:10:16] my knees on my bed and I said Lord I'm
[1:10:18] in the post of duty and I laid my hand
[1:10:20] on my stomach I said in the name of
[1:10:21] Jesus Christ I don't have time for this
[1:10:24] through the sickness and within five
[1:10:26] minutes God knows I was
[1:10:28] well praise God because of his mercy and
[1:10:30] grace so sometimes he does it sometime
[1:10:32] sometimes he must suffer but the thing
[1:10:35] to do is have faith praise God
[1:10:37] confess God's Word be a faithful witness
[1:10:40] praise God trust God believe God and
[1:10:43] know that whatever he allows in your
[1:10:44] life it's for his glory
[1:10:49] so they pray and sing at midnight and
[1:10:54] the prisoners heard them I wonder what
[1:10:58] they thought of this midnight song this
[1:11:01] midnight melody I wonder what they
[1:11:04] thought of that and I wonder you know
[1:11:09] the Bible doesn't tell us that wonderful
[1:11:10] India was up praying that night for
[1:11:12] because member it happened to Peter -
[1:11:14] Peter was in prison and God brought him
[1:11:16] out of prison because they were in that
[1:11:17] group prayer I wonder if that's what
[1:11:19] Lydia was doing with the family so he's
[1:11:22] praying in and they're they're praying
[1:11:25] and they're singing now church that
[1:11:27] won't encourage us in our darkest hour
[1:11:30] may God may we be humble enough to just
[1:11:33] thank God and pray and sing his praises
[1:11:37] and raise our hands and worship remember
[1:11:39] his feet are chained up he can't walk he
[1:11:42] he can't go anywhere but he can't raise
[1:11:44] his hands
[1:11:45] amen right Scott he can't move his feet
[1:11:47] he can't physically go anywhere but he
[1:11:50] can lift he can lift his hands to heaven
[1:11:53] and sing and pray he can lift his voice
[1:11:55] and God honored their worship suddenly
[1:12:00] there was a great earthquake set the
[1:12:02] foundations the prison were shaken and
[1:12:04] immediately all the doors were opened
[1:12:06] and everyone's bands were loosed so
[1:12:10] godness doesn't loose pawns Silas all of
[1:12:14] them all of them even though they didn't
[1:12:18] deserve it praise God and the keeper of
[1:12:21] the prison awakened out of his sleep and
[1:12:23] seeing the prison doors open he drew out
[1:12:25] his sword and would have killed himself
[1:12:26] supposing that the prisoners had been
[1:12:28] fled but Paul cried with a loud voice
[1:12:31] saying do thyself no harm for we are all
[1:12:33] here he's remember in those days are in
[1:12:36] the Roman days even I was when the
[1:12:38] crucifixion of Christ took place those
[1:12:40] there was a Romans
[1:12:42] during group if that person they
[1:12:44] crucified didn't die then the Roman had
[1:12:46] to die the soldier the soldiers that
[1:12:50] were there at Jesus tomb if Jesus body
[1:12:53] got out they had to die so wonder what
[1:12:54] happened that was Roman law if that's
[1:12:58] why they were so good at their jobs
[1:13:00] that's why those soldiers you know it's
[1:13:01] stuck in with the spears to make sure
[1:13:04] they are dead because if they don't die
[1:13:05] they're gonna die so Paul says he says
[1:13:09] sir don't kill yourself we're still all
[1:13:11] here all the prisoners are here they're
[1:13:14] just loose stay men right look at the
[1:13:17] power of God the church if God can loose
[1:13:20] our natural of their natural bands what
[1:13:23] about our spiritual bands praise God
[1:13:25] if God can can loose your those natural
[1:13:28] physical chains what about our diction's
[1:13:31] praise God what about our bad habits God
[1:13:33] can send all of us free praise God amen
[1:13:37] if he can do these natural things how
[1:13:40] much more could he do spiritual things
[1:13:42] by the blood of his son amen hallelujah
[1:13:47] what a beautiful story he says do
[1:13:52] thyself no harm verse 29 then he called
[1:13:54] for a light and sprang in and came
[1:13:57] trembling and fell down before Paul and
[1:13:59] Silas to see all these things are
[1:14:00] working together
[1:14:01] God knew there was a little woman there
[1:14:03] that wanted to be delivered from those
[1:14:04] demon powers so God sent a man of God to
[1:14:07] do it God knew there was a no prison
[1:14:10] guard who wanted to be saved amen and
[1:14:12] not just him but his whole house amen
[1:14:16] hallelujah are you happy with just you
[1:14:19] being saved or do you want to see
[1:14:21] everyone in your house saved amen I want
[1:14:24] to see all the house saying praise God
[1:14:26] so God knew there was a prison guard
[1:14:29] though the way to get his attention
[1:14:31] would be to shake his life I think
[1:14:33] that's what God is doing right now don't
[1:14:34] you think for the Jose now they shaking
[1:14:36] this earth with the coronavirus amen he
[1:14:39] shake his saying anybody who wants to be
[1:14:41] saying you better get saved praise God
[1:14:43] amen and the Bible said and then he said
[1:14:48] unto them and verse 30 sirs what must I
[1:14:50] do to be saved and they said believe on
[1:14:54] the Lord Jesus
[1:14:56] and thou shalt be saved and thy house
[1:14:59] oh what a promise praise God what a
[1:15:03] promise he said believe on the Lord
[1:15:07] Jesus Christ and they shall be saved and
[1:15:10] thy house so you want to see your family
[1:15:12] save just keep believing you want to see
[1:15:16] somebody saved you want to see your
[1:15:17] family their life change just believe
[1:15:20] just trust God just love God just
[1:15:23] worship God we cannot doubt God we've
[1:15:25] got to believe God we got to trust him
[1:15:28] we've got to know that he hears our
[1:15:30] prayers we got to know that he cares and
[1:15:32] that he loves the sinner praise God and
[1:15:35] he has a great plan and his ways as we
[1:15:37] said last week his ways are higher than
[1:15:39] our ways his ways are past finding out
[1:15:42] praise God and if God saved a wretch
[1:15:44] like you and I God can save them as well
[1:15:46] praise the Lord amen
[1:15:50] they speak unto Him the word of the Lord
[1:15:53] and to all that were in his house and he
[1:15:56] took them the same hour of the night now
[1:15:59] I don't know how they did this legally
[1:16:01] whether he because they were prisoners
[1:16:03] now and washed their stripes and was
[1:16:07] baptized he and of his house straightway
[1:16:12] so remember they just got beaten up
[1:16:13] Paul's back was probably like hamburger
[1:16:15] right they beat him up and put him in
[1:16:17] jail with the Bible said that night they
[1:16:19] washed all their stripes cleaned off
[1:16:21] their wounds and then Paul with his
[1:16:23] stripes
[1:16:24] baptized this the guy that probably we
[1:16:26] whipped and maybe or maybe one of his
[1:16:29] buddies whipped him the very guy the
[1:16:31] very group he finds mercy he sweet you
[1:16:35] got to be a Holy Ghost filled st. to do
[1:16:37] something like that somebody can beat
[1:16:39] you up and speak awful and just tear you
[1:16:42] down and leave you for dead in a jail
[1:16:44] but you had that very same night that
[1:16:46] someone treated like that you can turn
[1:16:48] around and baptize them and welcomed him
[1:16:50] into the family of God uh-huh you've got
[1:16:53] to have a new nature you got a have
[1:16:55] eternal life living in you praise God
[1:16:58] amen that's why brother cams testimony
[1:17:03] so powerful because for a year he fought
[1:17:05] us he fought simontann he's like you
[1:17:07] you're wrong and he tried
[1:17:09] talk me out of it and I don't want to
[1:17:10] talk to him anymore you know but all of
[1:17:12] a sudden the revelation struck him and
[1:17:15] he said the name of the Father Son Holy
[1:17:17] Ghost is Jesus Christ where can I be
[1:17:21] baptized call up that preacher brother
[1:17:22] Brooks let me be baptized amen and now
[1:17:25] God has used brother Ken to baptize many
[1:17:27] a soul many a soul have been baptized
[1:17:30] there it's that change
[1:17:33] it's that transformation power of God's
[1:17:36] Spirit amen
[1:17:38] thank the Lord all of us look he in his
[1:17:42] house so the very thing he desired he
[1:17:45] had to been he had been desiring this he
[1:17:47] had have known this cities filled with
[1:17:49] sorcery miss cities through with
[1:17:51] idolatry he hadn't been hungry for God
[1:17:54] because God made a way that he could be
[1:17:56] saved and they took he in his house and
[1:17:59] baptized all them straightway praise God
[1:18:02] when I almost got all my house baptized
[1:18:04] straightway we get I see that's what
[1:18:07] happened God just got shook it and
[1:18:09] everybody got baptized God had an
[1:18:11] earthquake and it caused everybody to
[1:18:13] get baptized we'll see we'll see how
[1:18:16] many people get baptized because it's
[1:18:17] coronavirus praise God I don't know how
[1:18:21] many but it's just a time of shaking a
[1:18:24] member church were in the gleaning time
[1:18:26] remember the feast of weeks I mentioned
[1:18:28] on Easter we're at the very end of that
[1:18:31] and God said when you harvest leave some
[1:18:34] there for the Gleaners where were just
[1:18:37] the Gleaners there's not going to be a
[1:18:39] whole lot but when there's one or two we
[1:18:42] ought to rejoice amen because that's
[1:18:45] prophetic before the trumpets can sound
[1:18:48] before the two witnesses can sound
[1:18:49] there's got to be Gleaners there's got
[1:18:52] to be people that will glean for those
[1:18:54] last few Souls
[1:18:55] that's prophetically what you are not
[1:18:57] are to be doing to try to find souls
[1:19:00] that we can believe just a few here just
[1:19:03] a few there and bring them into God's
[1:19:05] kingdom glory verse 34
[1:19:12] when he had brought them into his house
[1:19:13] he set meat before them and rejoiced
[1:19:18] believing in God with all of his house
[1:19:20] just a few hours ago he was sleeping all
[1:19:23] these noisy prisoners and they're just
[1:19:25] in a few moments he gives he washes the
[1:19:27] guy's back he gets baptized vibe
[1:19:30] he sets meat before him praise God his
[1:19:34] house is open to the messenger of the
[1:19:37] hour praise God
[1:19:43] now look here verses thirty five to
[1:19:46] forty finish this this particular
[1:19:51] portion of Philippi and this is all the
[1:19:53] Bible says about the beginning of Philip
[1:19:56] I praise the Lord unless redone and when
[1:20:01] it was day the magistrate sent the
[1:20:03] sergeant saying let these men let those
[1:20:05] men go and the keeper of the prison told
[1:20:09] the saying nopal the magistrates have
[1:20:11] sent to let you go now therefore depart
[1:20:13] and go in peace now look at this leaders
[1:20:15] were so shocked
[1:20:16] can you imagine there's a prison over
[1:20:19] there an Akron down the road he imagine
[1:20:21] if that whole place was shaked in that
[1:20:22] it was just totally ever every prisoner
[1:20:24] was loosed it just shook these leaders
[1:20:28] see they knew the power Satan right
[1:20:30] because they had sorcery they Devils and
[1:20:32] all kinds of things but then they saw
[1:20:34] the real power of God and so they say
[1:20:37] fine get these guys out of here just
[1:20:39] like the maniac of got it right they
[1:20:41] said we'd rather have pigs and we'd
[1:20:44] rather have demon-possessed men than
[1:20:45] have this Jesus amongst us the same
[1:20:48] thing happened to Paul they said get
[1:20:50] this man out of here depart and go in
[1:20:53] peace verse 37 but Paul said unto them
[1:20:56] they have beaten us openly can
[1:20:58] uncondensed and if cast us into prison
[1:21:02] and now do they thrust us out privately
[1:21:03] nay verily but let them come themselves
[1:21:07] and fetch us out so Paul saying I'm a
[1:21:10] Roman if they want to get me out they're
[1:21:12] going to come get me because I'm a Roman
[1:21:14] they have to do it by the law now he
[1:21:17] knows right he knows that what's gonna
[1:21:18] easy you know he's got to go to give his
[1:21:20] life in Rome verse 38 and the sergeant's
[1:21:22] told these words and the magistrates and
[1:21:24] they feared when
[1:21:25] I heard that they were Romans see cuz
[1:21:27] you can't just you can't do it a Rome in
[1:21:29] a certain way you got to treat the
[1:21:31] Romans according to the law verse 39 and
[1:21:34] they came and besought them see they
[1:21:36] knew this should not have beat him
[1:21:37] because they were Romans and they came
[1:21:39] and besought them and brought them out
[1:21:40] and desire them to depart out of the
[1:21:42] country and they went out of the prison
[1:21:45] and entered in the house of Lydia and
[1:21:47] when they had seen the brother and they
[1:21:49] comforted them and departed look at this
[1:21:51] in one case
[1:21:53] leave this church in one case Paul
[1:21:55] obeyed the law right
[1:21:58] another case he didn't obey the law
[1:22:02] there's a time there's a time to obey it
[1:22:04] there's a time not see that that's
[1:22:08] exactly right look at that see he goes
[1:22:13] to the house of Lydia and so he says
[1:22:14] fine he says if they want me to go I'll
[1:22:16] go and there's other times they would
[1:22:19] preach and and just go against them
[1:22:21] right and preach God's Word when there's
[1:22:23] times you obey the law of God or the law
[1:22:25] of man as well I imagine what that last
[1:22:29] meeting was like you know so Lydia was
[1:22:31] there met the boss of certain days right
[1:22:33] certain days I imagine you know she
[1:22:37] she'd pray for this all of her life God
[1:22:40] send a man of God to our parts o Lord
[1:22:44] send a man of God it really will preach
[1:22:46] your word and show us your power your
[1:22:49] glory and then he comes in but don't say
[1:22:52] very long now look at that God he starts
[1:22:57] a little church they stay there for a
[1:22:58] certain number of days and then the man
[1:23:00] of God moves on do you think they were
[1:23:04] discouraged probably a little bit but
[1:23:06] don't you know if God started to church
[1:23:08] there he would raise somebody up to lead
[1:23:10] the church praise God he's obligated
[1:23:13] right God's obligated and so just
[1:23:18] because the man of God just because the
[1:23:20] Prophet leaves doesn't mean God's gonna
[1:23:23] leave the church is that right just cuz
[1:23:26] programs off the scene don't mean the
[1:23:28] same God isn't here praise God God is
[1:23:32] still here it's all parts our turn now
[1:23:35] to seek the Lord while he may be found
[1:23:38] call upon him while he's not praise God
[1:23:42] it's our opportunity to preach the Word
[1:23:46] of God in the message and to live this
[1:23:47] word before everybody it's our
[1:23:49] opportunity and that's it that
[1:23:51] should be an exciting thing praise God
[1:23:53] and his last words are comfort don't be
[1:23:57] discouraged sister Lydia I know we
[1:24:00] didn't get all the time here I would
[1:24:01] like to stay longer to teach you God's
[1:24:03] Word but there's faithful men you know
[1:24:05] fo fresh and there's different ones I'll
[1:24:07] send Timothy and different ones like
[1:24:09] that don't be discourage God started the
[1:24:13] church here he's gonna be with the
[1:24:15] church here praise God I won't be here
[1:24:19] the whole time
[1:24:20] I've got other place I got to go crazy
[1:24:22] but you don't be discouraged you just
[1:24:24] trust in the Living God I mean it be
[1:24:28] comforted
[1:24:29] don't be discouraged be encouraged
[1:24:32] praise God but when our leaders not here
[1:24:36] the great man of God's not here but
[1:24:38] you're here I don't know but God still
[1:24:41] has a witness here praise God see Church
[1:24:46] every one of you is so important to God
[1:24:48] you all fit into God's plan praise the
[1:24:50] Lord
[1:24:51] God starts a church and then he moves
[1:24:54] the Prophet he moves the angel of the
[1:24:56] Lord the star of the Lord he moves his
[1:24:58] fiery burning star out and the people
[1:25:01] are just left with that experience that
[1:25:03] they had and now it's their turn to get
[1:25:07] to know the Lord it's their turn to
[1:25:08] learn to serve the Lord praise God it's
[1:25:12] their turn like Paul Paul it was Paul's
[1:25:15] turn on Damascus Lord he said what's
[1:25:17] your name he said my name is Jesus and
[1:25:19] then Paul said Lord what would you have
[1:25:21] me to do praise God that's what God was
[1:25:23] doing with Lydia and all those Saints
[1:25:26] they were moving on but it was their
[1:25:28] chance to say Lord what do you want me
[1:25:30] to do for you praise God
[1:25:33] that's a great question if you have the
[1:25:35] aspect question lately it's your time to
[1:25:38] ask that question Lord what do you want
[1:25:40] me to do let's go read now let's read
[1:25:42] Acts 9 real quick since we're there what
[1:25:44] would you have me to do Lord that's one
[1:25:47] of the most beautiful questions you can
[1:25:49] ask Church not low
[1:25:52] how much money am I gonna make or or
[1:25:53] Lord how many businesses will I start
[1:25:56] that's not the question to ask the
[1:25:58] question is Lord what do you want me to
[1:26:00] do that's right
[1:26:13] right chapter yes verse six and he
[1:26:18] trembling and astonished and said Lord
[1:26:20] what would that have me to do and the
[1:26:22] Lord said him arise and go in the city
[1:26:24] and it should be told thee what thou
[1:26:26] must do so Jesus didn't tell him
[1:26:28] everything at the beginning he had to
[1:26:30] keep serving Jesus and then Jesus would
[1:26:33] show him what he was called to do later
[1:26:36] hallelujah
[1:26:37] look at verse 15 but the Lord said unto
[1:26:39] him go thy way he's talking to Ananias
[1:26:42] for he is a chosen vessel unto me to
[1:26:45] bear my name before the Gentiles and
[1:26:47] kings and the children of Israel for I
[1:26:49] will show him how great things he must
[1:26:52] suffer for my name's sake
[1:26:55] being a Christian wasn't going to be a
[1:26:57] picnic right it was going to be a life
[1:27:01] of suffering yes there's you know you
[1:27:05] have the moments of the power is
[1:27:07] resurrection sometimes I wanted that by
[1:27:08] the Amen why God don't let me cast out
[1:27:10] more demons I don't know but there's not
[1:27:13] many demon-possessed people that come
[1:27:14] here which is good I don't want people
[1:27:17] to be demon-possessed in our church but
[1:27:20] see there's part of it were and I
[1:27:22] believe God showed me those things to
[1:27:24] show me the power of his resurrection
[1:27:25] but then God showed me you also have to
[1:27:28] partake of his sufferings it's not all
[1:27:34] power so no just supernatural all the
[1:27:36] time part of it is learning to die to
[1:27:38] self learning to take up your cross
[1:27:40] daily and follow the Lord Jesus like
[1:27:46] last time was that brother cam Church
[1:27:47] remember I was praying for that little
[1:27:49] boy I'd like to hear how he's doing now
[1:27:51] but his mom is the one that was heal to
[1:27:52] cancer she had the cancer on her neither
[1:27:54] and I know she had I trouble I was just
[1:27:56] praying for the boy and when I got done
[1:27:58] with the boy
[1:27:58] she said she opened her eyes and she was
[1:28:01] her eyesight was instantly healed she
[1:28:02] said she just had like he was looking
[1:28:04] through two lenses everything else was
[1:28:06] blurry she said but when she opened her
[1:28:08] eyes her eyes were perfectly well now
[1:28:11] why are those things happen I don't know
[1:28:13] but it's it's God showing us that we
[1:28:16] live in resurrection power I love that
[1:28:19] song praise God and now I live see it's
[1:28:22] a power I live in a man
[1:28:24] we live in that resurrection power but
[1:28:27] we must also learn to suffer for his
[1:28:29] name's sake see Paul had to go stand
[1:28:33] there before all those Romans right here
[1:28:37] to stand before all these men just to
[1:28:38] bear and they all killed him are they
[1:28:40] all want him to die they all blaspheme
[1:28:42] is God but he had to stand there as a
[1:28:45] witness for Jesus Christ to condemn all
[1:28:48] those sinners on that day part of his
[1:28:50] life was much suffering yeah there was
[1:28:54] great glory right he tossed off that
[1:28:55] serpent in the fire and they also this
[1:28:59] is a God he said no I serve God a man
[1:29:01] I'm not God I serve the Living God
[1:29:04] great times of great resurrection power
[1:29:07] but a lot of times it was suffering
[1:29:13] Church I wonder sometimes do we get
[1:29:16] discouraged sometimes and suffering yeah
[1:29:18] we do but God gives us hope that's what
[1:29:24] I see church even in the midst this
[1:29:25] coronavirus you know there's many
[1:29:27] discouraging moments there's moments of
[1:29:28] fear when the midst of it God gives us
[1:29:30] hope God gives us hope
[1:29:35] we know there's times and seasons for
[1:29:38] everything we should have hope that will
[1:29:42] come out of this if if they came out of
[1:29:44] the swine-flu
[1:29:45] but it was 11 years ago 12 years ago if
[1:29:48] they came out of that will come out of
[1:29:50] this we got to have hope that God is
[1:29:54] using it for our good everything works
[1:29:58] together for our good and not to sound
[1:30:01] carnal but I got that check from you
[1:30:03] know the trumpet that really helped out
[1:30:04] my family that I can see how that works
[1:30:06] out for good that was a lot of money it
[1:30:09] wasn't as much as Obama when Obama I
[1:30:11] remember when the market crash in 2008
[1:30:13] we got a bigger check for for Obama we
[1:30:16] really needed that money too it's just
[1:30:18] one little simple thing that God is
[1:30:20] interested in every detail of our lives
[1:30:23] and all things will work together for
[1:30:26] our good when we love the Lord
[1:30:28] hallelujah
[1:30:30] and so the man
[1:30:33] of God moves on he says let me just have
[1:30:37] one more opportunity to speak with
[1:30:38] sister Lydia and her household I just
[1:30:41] want to encourage them and comfort them
[1:30:43] before I go and so the man of God
[1:30:46] comforts remember Paul comfort of the
[1:30:48] Thessalonians which is actually the next
[1:30:50] city he goes to in Acts chapter 18
[1:30:52] Thessalonica when the church starts
[1:30:54] there remember what he say he said
[1:30:56] comfort one another with these words
[1:30:58] that the dead in Christ will rise first
[1:31:00] the rapture was comforting words to
[1:31:04] those people because they see many
[1:31:05] Christians die time was moving on Jesus
[1:31:08] hadn't come back he said but let me
[1:31:10] encourage you the dead in Christ rise
[1:31:12] first amen
[1:31:14] I wonder if Paul said the same thing to
[1:31:16] Lydia let me encourage you you're gonna
[1:31:19] suffer you're gonna go through difficult
[1:31:21] trials a member Church not only was Paul
[1:31:26] going to be persecuted but all the
[1:31:28] Christians living in Philippi afterward
[1:31:30] we're going to be persecuted whenever
[1:31:32] God whenever God moved it and and and
[1:31:36] let's say delivered somebody like that
[1:31:38] woman with the divination the sinners
[1:31:40] would pounce on them and beat them up
[1:31:42] and kinda like the Muslim countries
[1:31:44] today right they beat up Christians they
[1:31:47] can cast them into prison something
[1:31:48] similar to that so this was going to be
[1:31:50] a group of Christians that would go
[1:31:52] through much suffering and that's where
[1:31:55] Paul writes them the letter from his
[1:31:58] prison in Philippians chapter 1 so now
[1:32:01] let's transition over there to
[1:32:03] Philippians chapter 1 and we'll close
[1:32:04] here and I'm a little bit by God's grace
[1:32:08] Philippians chapter 1 this has been
[1:32:10] called the the book of joy did you know
[1:32:12] that I listen to different preachers
[1:32:13] preach on this book it's called the book
[1:32:16] of joy but it's a paradox
[1:32:20] how can a man riding from prison
[1:32:22] arrested knowing that he's gonna die
[1:32:25] soon how can he have joy it's a paradox
[1:32:28] it's the peace of God that comes when
[1:32:31] you know you've done his will praise God
[1:32:34] it's that like it's like we sing it's
[1:32:37] that blessed assurance Jesus is mine
[1:32:42] see Paul had that blessed assurance yeah
[1:32:46] assurance in his heart I know I've done
[1:32:48] what Jesus is brought me to do and so I
[1:32:52] could have joined my heart despite my
[1:32:54] situation despite my circumstances
[1:32:57] I'll choose joy there's a little song
[1:33:01] that goes like that
[1:33:01] I choose joy that's not it they don't
[1:33:03] say the name of Jesus in that song but
[1:33:05] they got some good ideas in there Paul
[1:33:08] had to choose am I gonna be discouraged
[1:33:10] in jail or am I gonna choose joy and
[1:33:12] Paul chose joy in jail
[1:33:15] Philippians chapter 1 remember 11 years
[1:33:28] after Paul started a church through a
[1:33:32] prayer meeting he starts a church
[1:33:35] through a prayer meeting somebody hears
[1:33:37] him pray and opens her heart it just
[1:33:39] gets a few little converts there and
[1:33:40] then God does a mighty miracle he or a
[1:33:43] cast out a demon and then he does a
[1:33:44] little miracle they're gonna they get a
[1:33:48] whole household baptized so it's Lydia
[1:33:50] maybe her house and then this jail
[1:33:52] keepers house they got two houses here
[1:33:54] and then the the Prophet goes on said
[1:33:57] you two families you hold it down let me
[1:34:01] comfort you be encouraged God's done a
[1:34:03] great work here I've got to go preach
[1:34:05] elsewhere you you hold down the fort
[1:34:07] praise God praise God a man aren't you
[1:34:12] encouraged Church God if God starts
[1:34:15] something he's gonna finish it praise
[1:34:18] God so let's be encouraged of what God
[1:34:21] does let's be let's be enthused to be
[1:34:25] part of what God has been doing praise
[1:34:27] God hallelujah oh I'm so thankful for
[1:34:31] the Lord amen thank you Jesus hallelujah
[1:34:34] in the midst of trial we should choose
[1:34:38] joy cuz you know church remember we just
[1:34:45] got off Easter the reason we're not
[1:34:46] alone is because Christ was alone so he
[1:34:49] became all alone so that we can say for
[1:34:53] the Jose I'm never alone with Amen
[1:34:55] Christ has never left our church alone
[1:34:57] but that's that's the Word of God he was
[1:35:02] alone he took all of our sin so that we
[1:35:04] didn't have to be alone praise God hey
[1:35:08] man now let's go a little bit more
[1:35:10] minutes here flipping chapter 1 what a
[1:35:17] beautiful letter written from prison
[1:35:20] because he talks about it later in this
[1:35:21] chapter my bonds he talks about my bonds
[1:35:24] he's writing from prison now verse 1
[1:35:30] Paul and Timothy associ they must have
[1:35:33] known timotheus the servants of Jesus
[1:35:36] Christ to all the saints in Christ Jesus
[1:35:39] nuts who's born again right in Christ
[1:35:41] Jesus which are at Philippi with the
[1:35:44] bishops and deacons samaya lots happened
[1:35:47] 11 years they start off they just got to
[1:35:50] families 11 years later Paul realizes he
[1:35:53] hears back from first and different ones
[1:35:55] they've got bishops
[1:35:57] they've got deacons they got a real
[1:35:59] church going there praise the hook so
[1:36:02] god bless it raise up some of those
[1:36:03] young men to be bishops pastors now of
[1:36:06] course as you know a bishop is a pastor
[1:36:09] so there was more than one Church there
[1:36:11] because he said bishops right so there
[1:36:15] was a church maybe on this side of the
[1:36:16] city maybe right where that Jail was and
[1:36:19] there's a church over there by Lydia's
[1:36:20] house probably right
[1:36:22] maybe there's a church at the jail
[1:36:23] keepers house there was bishops there's
[1:36:27] more than one pastor and there was
[1:36:29] deacons men of faith they'll be able to
[1:36:33] handle the the natural needs of the
[1:36:35] church now thank God we don't have many
[1:36:36] natural needs as far as I know here so
[1:36:39] we haven't needed that much but you know
[1:36:43] when there's sick people or when there's
[1:36:45] people that are hungry deacons are the
[1:36:47] ones that go to take care of that many
[1:36:48] times so then the preachers can just
[1:36:50] focus on the word right that's what God
[1:36:52] set it up in the book of Acts when
[1:36:54] there's a big group of people right but
[1:36:56] thankfully God is giving me a church
[1:36:57] where hardly anybody gets sick
[1:36:59] I just thank the Lord for that - God has
[1:37:02] been merciful but he says I'm writing to
[1:37:05] the bishops the pastors and the Deacons
[1:37:08] grace be unto you and peace from God our
[1:37:10] Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:37:13] see invisible and visible you you we can
[1:37:18] never separate that right because Jesus
[1:37:19] is the image of the invisible person
[1:37:22] right so Paul he always knows there's
[1:37:26] only one person but there's a father
[1:37:29] there's invisible and there's visible
[1:37:31] praise God he never he never gets rid of
[1:37:37] that there's always invisible visible
[1:37:39] verse three I thank my god I look at
[1:37:42] this upon every remembrance of you there
[1:37:44] was time to the Amen he think back he'd
[1:37:47] be discouraged Aaron his bonds but he
[1:37:49] remember back my the god the god that's
[1:37:52] with me now is the same God that brought
[1:37:54] me out of that jail at church look at
[1:37:57] look at this
[1:37:58] Paul's in a prison and he's not
[1:38:00] discouraged that he's in prison because
[1:38:02] he knows God brought me out of the
[1:38:05] prison in other words if God wants me to
[1:38:07] come out of this trial he'll bring me
[1:38:08] out but if he doesn't I still serve God
[1:38:11] amen see well he could have had a pity
[1:38:15] party system you know he said well God
[1:38:17] you you brought me out of that prison
[1:38:18] why don't you bring me on this one but
[1:38:20] he was wiser than that praise God he
[1:38:22] wasn't a foolish virgin amen
[1:38:24] oh yeah he knew he was if God God's in
[1:38:28] control of my life amen
[1:38:29] the foot sets of the righteous are order
[1:38:31] the Lord praise God if God wants me out
[1:38:34] of the present he'll bring me out
[1:38:35] because he did it before he can do it
[1:38:38] again praise God
[1:38:39] amen that's why I'm not discouraged and
[1:38:42] people don't get healed right away when
[1:38:44] I pray for them I don't get discouraged
[1:38:46] because I know I didn't heal the ones
[1:38:48] that got healed in the first place it's
[1:38:50] not up to me it's up to God amen I just
[1:38:54] heard I listened to take inside with
[1:38:56] Jesus yesterday brother Rams talking to
[1:38:58] preachers I was mowing the grass I got
[1:39:00] this in the whole sermon
[1:39:02] I've been talking to preachers and he
[1:39:04] says brothers he said God may not heal
[1:39:08] one person through your prayers he said
[1:39:12] but when you
[1:39:12] to heaven God will still reward you he
[1:39:14] said just be faithful Abraham said I've
[1:39:18] always said if I pray for five hundred
[1:39:20] people and they died that night he said
[1:39:23] I'd go back preaching divine healing the
[1:39:24] next morning God Amen because I know I'm
[1:39:30] not the author of anyone's healing Jesus
[1:39:33] is the author and finisher of our faith
[1:39:35] praise God hallelujah here's a man
[1:39:39] riding from prison and he's not
[1:39:40] discouraged all she can say is thank God
[1:39:43] that he started this church in Phillip I
[1:39:46] thank God every time I remember what
[1:39:50] God's doing done in Akron praise God
[1:39:53] thank you Jesus praise the Lord
[1:39:56] think about that church that means any
[1:39:58] little church anything that God starts
[1:40:01] off a real man of God and look back and
[1:40:03] say praise the Lord I'm so thankful for
[1:40:05] what God's done now remember we'll go
[1:40:10] later in chapter four he chopped there's
[1:40:12] two and three he balls out all the false
[1:40:14] doctrine that that Christian Judaizers
[1:40:17] were preaching but then the end of the
[1:40:19] book there's two women that got them a
[1:40:20] big struggle that's messing up to one of
[1:40:22] the churches there and so paul has to
[1:40:24] correct those women they're arguing in
[1:40:27] there we couldn't getting one Accord now
[1:40:29] remember this like I said last week this
[1:40:31] is the same church that they knew that
[1:40:33] God shook the prison he physically shook
[1:40:35] the prison they knew the power of God
[1:40:38] but yet two women went to sit in the
[1:40:40] church and argue and fuss and Paul said
[1:40:43] can't you figure this out seen in your
[1:40:46] church no matter what supernatural
[1:40:48] things there are we're still gonna have
[1:40:49] to battle this deep this devil this test
[1:40:52] house that we got inside of us right
[1:40:53] I said they devil it's this this is in
[1:40:55] nature we're still gonna have to battle
[1:40:58] that like for example any church where
[1:41:04] you know the preacher knew brother
[1:41:05] Branham they go through troubles too
[1:41:07] they have they have awful hardships in
[1:41:09] the church and you would think my their
[1:41:11] pastor knew brother Branham why do we
[1:41:13] got to go through this because God
[1:41:14] allows these trials to perfect our faith
[1:41:17] the trial of your faith is more precious
[1:41:20] than gold praise God
[1:41:22] so the same churches that saw people
[1:41:25] walk out of prison
[1:41:26] and demons cast out now they're arguing
[1:41:30] they can't the church can't get one
[1:41:32] Accord and Paul's pleading with them
[1:41:33] please get in one Accord getting one
[1:41:35] mind try to all want the same thing for
[1:41:38] God's will to be done and for Jesus
[1:41:40] Christ to be glorified why should people
[1:41:43] argue in the church he tells them later
[1:41:45] at the end of the book so that now
[1:41:48] doesn't this book make more sense now
[1:41:49] doesn't it when you can see how a church
[1:41:52] started look what it started with the
[1:41:55] prayer meeting and and it started with
[1:41:57] supernatural miracles and then now you
[1:41:59] can appreciate how Paul Howard a prophet
[1:42:03] a man that saw the power of God that
[1:42:05] casts out demons
[1:42:06] what would he write to that little
[1:42:08] church so it's so encouraging for us
[1:42:11] it's encouraging to me remember Paul
[1:42:15] left this little message church just
[1:42:17] after a certain few days said now you're
[1:42:20] all gonna be alright
[1:42:21] let me comfort you Jesus is with you the
[1:42:25] one who took the prison he's with you
[1:42:26] today
[1:42:26] praise God he's still with you verse
[1:42:30] three I thank my god upon every
[1:42:33] remembrance of you hallelujah verse four
[1:42:40] always in every prayer of mine for all
[1:42:43] for you all making requests with joy my
[1:42:48] church picture that he's in jail and he
[1:42:53] thinks about all I remember that revival
[1:42:55] in acts 16
[1:42:56] I remember going on that second
[1:42:58] missionary trip oh thank you lord
[1:43:01] I just think of those people I'm so
[1:43:02] joyful that there's a church in Philippi
[1:43:05] I praise God think about this think
[1:43:09] about how how significant you are think
[1:43:13] about how significant this church is in
[1:43:15] God's eyes I think a good example of
[1:43:21] that let's just try to be encouraged
[1:43:23] today with our small church just be
[1:43:25] encouraged because remember the church
[1:43:27] up in Sheffield they're their bigger
[1:43:28] Church now right but I've talked to
[1:43:31] their uh their former pastor the one who
[1:43:33] started they started out with YMCA
[1:43:35] meetings for years they rented out a
[1:43:37] YMCA and they
[1:43:40] and they were there was such a hard
[1:43:41] thing to do to meet and and the church
[1:43:44] was very small for many years and then
[1:43:48] as I started growing after the years one
[1:43:51] of the brothers when they got so big
[1:43:52] they didn't want to run out anymore
[1:43:54] one of the brothers cashed in his
[1:43:56] retirement policy I don't know how much
[1:43:59] it must have been like fifty thousand or
[1:44:01] a hundred thousand he cashed that in
[1:44:03] took the money so he could put a down
[1:44:05] payment on their church building and he
[1:44:08] wasn't even the pre key wasn't even the
[1:44:09] pastor now look at that now I don't care
[1:44:13] if we have a building or not but I'm
[1:44:14] just saying look at the devotion that
[1:44:16] believers should have when God does
[1:44:19] something great and starts to the church
[1:44:21] look how devoted we should be to the
[1:44:23] cause of Christ willing to cash in your
[1:44:28] retirement and give it for Jesus's
[1:44:30] Church my goodness that's why Paul says
[1:44:36] these people the world's not worthy of
[1:44:39] them praise God of whom the world is not
[1:44:44] worthy to be around these type of people
[1:44:46] they love God they love God's people so
[1:44:49] much they give up everything for God's
[1:44:52] church of whom the world is not worthy
[1:44:57] Paul said in Hebrews 12 11
[1:45:00] sorry Hebrews 11 so Paul sat there and
[1:45:04] he said I'm in prison yet I've gotten
[1:45:06] joy whenever I think of that church
[1:45:09] those churches that started alls I have
[1:45:11] his joy in my heart every time I
[1:45:12] remember the churches verse 5 he said
[1:45:20] for your fellowship in the gospel from
[1:45:22] the first day until now I think about
[1:45:26] that church can you remember the first
[1:45:27] day you got into fellowship as a
[1:45:29] Christian Paul could Paul remembers the
[1:45:33] day Lydia got saved
[1:45:35] oh thank god amen he said I remember
[1:45:39] that day we had prayer meeting and God
[1:45:42] opened Lydia's heart that's how much the
[1:45:46] church meant to Paul I remember the day
[1:45:48] when Amen got saved
[1:45:50] sorry I knew yeah I remember baptizing
[1:45:55] lydia malachi years ago praise God he
[1:45:59] said I remember the very dead I remember
[1:46:01] baptize and sister who by God's grace
[1:46:05] that's a beautiful day after that was a
[1:46:07] beautiful day sunshiny a hot that was a
[1:46:10] glorious day I think we baptized five or
[1:46:12] six that day
[1:46:13] Paul said I remember the very day and
[1:46:16] every time I think of that time my heart
[1:46:20] just feels with joy because now you're
[1:46:23] serving Jesus Christ you're not with the
[1:46:27] demon-possessed sorcerers where Satan's
[1:46:30] to steal and lie and destroy your life
[1:46:33] he said I just give God joy you are a
[1:46:35] Christian because you're in Christ Jesus
[1:46:38] hallelujah he said I give thanks every
[1:46:45] prayer mine I thank the Lord for your
[1:46:47] fellowship from the first day until now
[1:46:51] I'm so glad I get to shake all your
[1:46:53] hands you sisters and then you brothers
[1:46:57] I'm so glad I get to hug you I really do
[1:46:59] the core to that praise God
[1:47:02] cuz we don't you don't have that
[1:47:03] fellowship anywhere else there's no one
[1:47:05] else we can fellowship with like this
[1:47:08] then right here where we have a safe
[1:47:11] place it's like a safe haven praise God
[1:47:13] it's like a hospital you know it's the
[1:47:15] place we can come and we can feel
[1:47:17] refreshed we can feel healed we can feel
[1:47:20] loved here praise God
[1:47:21] though the world rejects us and makes
[1:47:23] fun of us and gives us a hard time I
[1:47:25] know one place where I'm gonna be loved
[1:47:27] that's in God's house amen
[1:47:29] that's what Paul saying every time I
[1:47:31] think about this fellowship I just saw
[1:47:34] thank the Lord
[1:47:35] Oh God has done great things in my in
[1:47:38] our life in our church praise God
[1:47:44] verse 6 this is a beautiful one of the
[1:47:49] most beautiful verses 4x God in the
[1:47:54] scripture I believe now of course he
[1:47:57] everyone's got their own little you know
[1:47:59] their own preferences as far as their
[1:48:00] favorite verses but this is one of the
[1:48:01] most beautiful verses the pians 1:6 let
[1:48:07] me pull up a little another scripture
[1:48:09] here and I think well we'll close with
[1:48:16] this let me close of this scripture
[1:48:17] right here
[1:48:18] being confident of this very thing that
[1:48:22] he which hath begun a good work in you
[1:48:26] will perform it until the day of Christ
[1:48:32] praise God he was only with them for a
[1:48:36] few certain days he didn't get all that
[1:48:37] he didn't get three years he got three
[1:48:40] years with Ephesus he wasn't with the
[1:48:42] Philippians that long he only had a few
[1:48:45] special very special days supernatural
[1:48:50] americo's ball so prayer meetings
[1:48:53] teaching the word baptizing those saints
[1:48:56] in the name of the Lord Jesus and he
[1:49:00] says you he said you need to become he
[1:49:02] said I'm confident of this very this
[1:49:04] very thing now what's the word confident
[1:49:06] mean it means assured believe persuaded
[1:49:15] trusting so Paul said I'm trusting of
[1:49:18] this very thing that God which began a
[1:49:21] good work in you will perform it unto
[1:49:24] the day of Christ Jesus the church go
[1:49:28] back to that go back to that day where
[1:49:31] God began to work can you remember that
[1:49:33] day now maybe it's like you maybe that
[1:49:37] may be yours like mine God worked on me
[1:49:39] for many years I just kept refused to
[1:49:41] refuse infusing but I remember the day I
[1:49:43] finally gave over praise God Paul saying
[1:49:48] that God he's I'm confident that God
[1:49:51] when he started that work in you he will
[1:49:54] perform it until the day of Jesus Christ
[1:49:57] that's either the rapture or the white
[1:50:00] throne judgment if you're wise or
[1:50:01] foolish version right God has started a
[1:50:06] work now Church you and I know we didn't
[1:50:09] go looking for God the Bible said God
[1:50:11] came looking for us
[1:50:13] when God started it he came looking for
[1:50:16] you
[1:50:17] he came knocking at your heart and said
[1:50:18] will you open up will you fellowship
[1:50:20] with me I love you I want to fellowship
[1:50:23] with you I want to take all your burdens
[1:50:25] away praise God amen
[1:50:27] he said I'm confident I'm trusting I'm
[1:50:30] assured that God is gonna finish and
[1:50:34] complete what he started in you it was a
[1:50:39] good work when God got ahold your life
[1:50:42] it was a good thing can you think of
[1:50:44] anything better in your life that
[1:50:46] started there's nothing better that ever
[1:50:48] start in your life than the day you
[1:50:51] surrendered to Jesus Christ and if God
[1:50:55] started that if God showed you his love
[1:50:58] if God showed you his mercy and you let
[1:51:03] him do that and let him bring you the
[1:51:05] gift of faith through love and all these
[1:51:07] things we know the scripture says then
[1:51:09] if God started it if he was in control
[1:51:11] on that day he'll be in control every
[1:51:14] day all the way to the last day praise
[1:51:16] God
[1:51:17] amen we know the last days come and
[1:51:19] quickly praise God amen
[1:51:22] if he was there on the first day he's
[1:51:26] there every day because God the Bible
[1:51:31] said he will perform it what's the word
[1:51:34] performing it means executed accomplish
[1:51:39] it finish it
[1:51:41] Oh glory if God started your salvation
[1:51:46] God will execute the rest of it amen
[1:51:50] in other words if God part of those red
[1:51:52] seas to bring you out of Egypt then God
[1:51:55] will take you in the promised land as
[1:51:56] well praise God
[1:51:58] now the nominations look at this
[1:52:00] scripture and they make it a license to
[1:52:02] sin but you've got to balance this this
[1:52:04] of course means God will finish it if
[1:52:06] you let him because God didn't force
[1:52:08] that generation that said Noah Kadish
[1:52:11] God didn't force them in fact God kept
[1:52:13] them out of the promised land right so
[1:52:17] this has to be balanced with all the
[1:52:19] other scriptures if God brought me out
[1:52:22] of Egypt he'll bring me in as long as I
[1:52:24] surrender to Him praise God
[1:52:26] as long as I love him and obey Him so
[1:52:31] see Church all these scriptures must
[1:52:33] because any denomination they will
[1:52:35] rejoice in the scripture just like you
[1:52:36] and I and thank God they do but they've
[1:52:39] got to let God continue the work they
[1:52:41] got to keep obeying the Word of God then
[1:52:45] God will complete it that's right
[1:52:48] now let me close with this if you would
[1:52:52] verse that I took a screenshot of these
[1:52:53] scriptures uh go to the go to the book
[1:52:55] of Deuteronomy I like to go there real
[1:52:56] quick here
[1:53:04] Deuteronomy if you would here go to
[1:53:10] chapter 6 Deuteronomy 6 now this is a
[1:53:12] beautiful book my I forgot how glorious
[1:53:14] this is so deuteronomy's right at the
[1:53:16] end of Israel's journey right before
[1:53:18] they go up possessed Canaan and
[1:53:20] Deuteronomy pne's a second law so it's
[1:53:23] like a second time Moses repeats
[1:53:25] everything to Israel before the new
[1:53:28] generation goes takes the promised land
[1:53:31] island idiot praise God he repeats
[1:53:33] everything all the way from the
[1:53:35] beginning goes all the way back to Egypt
[1:53:37] axis and brings them all the way through
[1:53:39] and prepares them and prepares Joshua to
[1:53:42] take the promised land
[1:53:43] that's what Deuteronomy is all about
[1:53:45] obvi that's what God's doing today right
[1:53:47] God is bringing back all the original
[1:53:49] teachings from the Apostle Paul from the
[1:53:52] Apostle John all the apostolic teaching
[1:53:55] God's referencing that back to us before
[1:53:59] we take a rapture praise God amen he
[1:54:02] promised to do it praise God I'll
[1:54:04] restore everything that the locusts and
[1:54:07] Palmer McCain Corrigan kind of pillar I
[1:54:09] mean I'll restore saith the Lord praise
[1:54:11] God hey man it's Scripture praise God
[1:54:14] God has to do it he has to restore his
[1:54:16] word back to his people hey man
[1:54:19] Deuteronomy 6 verse 22
[1:54:29] now verse 23 yeah I'm sorry verse 22 and
[1:54:35] the Lord shooting signs and wonders
[1:54:37] great and sore upon Egypt upon Pharaoh
[1:54:39] and upon all his household before our
[1:54:41] eyes and he brought us out from thence
[1:54:44] that he might bring us in oh I love it
[1:54:47] hey that's it brother and said brother
[1:54:49] and said Redemption is not just bringing
[1:54:51] you out he's got to take you into
[1:54:53] something praise God amen
[1:54:55] in other words the Holy Ghost he has to
[1:54:58] bring us out of the world to take us
[1:55:00] into the Holy Ghost hallelujah and all
[1:55:03] this place between out and in is the
[1:55:06] night sanctification and that's where
[1:55:07] most churches fall short of God's glory
[1:55:09] but see redemption is taking you out and
[1:55:12] into Christ oh thank the Lord I love it
[1:55:16] to give us the land which he sware unto
[1:55:18] our fathers verse 24 and the LORD
[1:55:20] commanded us to do all these statutes
[1:55:22] now look at this here it is why did God
[1:55:24] command all these things don't cut your
[1:55:26] hair
[1:55:27] don't cuss and drink and get drunk you
[1:55:28] men and don't commit adultery
[1:55:30] why Lord commanded us to do all these
[1:55:33] statutes to fear the Lord our God for
[1:55:35] our good always that he might preserve
[1:55:42] us alive as it is at this day why does
[1:55:48] God give us these commands it's always
[1:55:50] for your good Church God always has your
[1:55:55] best interests in mind always God always
[1:56:00] wants the best for you and when you're
[1:56:02] not sure which way to go and which one's
[1:56:05] going to be good it's the one that obeys
[1:56:07] the word praise God the one that obeys
[1:56:10] God word is the way the good way it's
[1:56:14] the way that God wants you to go it will
[1:56:16] always benefit you coronavirus has
[1:56:19] benefited me praise God all these
[1:56:24] different harsh trials they will benefit
[1:56:28] us if we can see that God is trying to
[1:56:31] do something that God wants us to say
[1:56:33] here's word and obey his word in the
[1:56:36] midst of the trial like I was telling
[1:56:38] brother bang on the text I said brother
[1:56:39] God hit me he has allowed your
[1:56:41] had to go through this for our good and
[1:56:43] no doubt for his good too
[1:56:46] that's why I was praying I said God let
[1:56:49] him be able to talk again and speak
[1:56:50] again so if I get a chance I can talk to
[1:56:52] him about Jesus or maybe one of his
[1:56:54] family members see Church all these
[1:56:56] things we don't know why they happened
[1:56:58] but it's for good like how about
[1:57:01] mike.mccluskey the guy that got shot
[1:57:02] he's in a wheelchair now he knows he had
[1:57:08] dreams before he got shot that he was
[1:57:10] going to be in a wheelchair he had a
[1:57:13] dream of it and he said God had to do
[1:57:16] that to Humble me because I was running
[1:57:18] from God so getting shot in the back and
[1:57:21] mean a wheelchair and paralyzed all
[1:57:23] worked out for his good so that he could
[1:57:28] go on TV and millions of people could
[1:57:30] see him holding up his King James Bible
[1:57:32] and forgiving the police officer that
[1:57:35] shot him all things work to your good
[1:57:39] always always God - the reason I gave
[1:57:46] these Commandments because everything is
[1:57:48] going to work out to your good doesn't
[1:57:57] that
[1:57:58] three with Romans eight where it says
[1:57:59] all things work together for good see
[1:58:02] God says the same thing in the old as in
[1:58:04] the new I'm gonna give you all these
[1:58:07] Commandments and it will always benefit
[1:58:10] you keep my commands verse 25 and it
[1:58:15] shall be our righteousness if we observe
[1:58:17] to do all these Commandments look if
[1:58:19] every commandment to F before the Lord
[1:58:24] our God as CF commanded us a church God
[1:58:29] did it all this because of his love go
[1:58:34] to chapter 7 verse 17 I'm trying to
[1:58:37] close my 7 7 to 8 why does God allow
[1:58:44] things it's all based upon his love for
[1:58:47] your good the Lord did not set his love
[1:58:50] upon you nor choose you because you were
[1:58:52] more in number than any other people for
[1:58:54] you were the fewest of people the good
[1:58:57] verse 8 acacia but because the Lord
[1:59:00] loved you and because he would keep the
[1:59:01] oath which he'd sworn to your father's
[1:59:04] God loved Israel even though they were
[1:59:07] stiff necked people that complained all
[1:59:09] the time
[1:59:09] God still loved them praise God you
[1:59:12] still love them and said if you just
[1:59:13] keep my commands it will always be for
[1:59:16] your good
[1:59:18] how much more us today I don't know this
[1:59:27] I gotta look this one up last one let's
[1:59:29] stand to our feet here and I'll closer
[1:59:31] it's still Deuteronomy there it is yeah
[1:59:45] Deuteronomy 10:13 yeah sorry this one I
[1:59:48] didn't get a chance to look it up sounds
[1:59:50] Reena this morning
[1:59:51] can you pull it up sweetheart
[1:59:52] Deuteronomy 10:13 now go up to verse 12
[2:00:00] though to start there and now Israel
[2:00:01] what does the Lord require of you what
[2:00:04] does God want from me today what does
[2:00:06] God require of you but to fear the Lord
[2:00:08] your God to walk in all his ways to love
[2:00:11] him to serve the LORD thy God with all
[2:00:13] thy heart and with all thy soul member
[2:00:15] Wednesday sermon how much does God want
[2:00:17] of your effort all of it you know why
[2:00:20] because he's worthy of all of it right
[2:00:23] he's worthy he he is worth all of your
[2:00:28] sacrifices because he loved you so much
[2:00:31] nobody could love me like Jesus praise
[2:00:34] God he says what does what does God
[2:00:37] require but just to walk in his ways to
[2:00:40] love him and to serve the Lord with all
[2:00:42] your heart with all your soul verse 13
[2:00:43] to keep the commandments of the Lord and
[2:00:46] his statutes which I command thee this
[2:00:48] day for whose good your God does not
[2:00:54] give you a commandment that will not
[2:00:56] work out for your good
[2:00:58] why does God keep asking me to do this
[2:01:00] why does the word say this it's for your
[2:01:03] good it's to change our selfish
[2:01:06] attitudes and the church said I'm
[2:01:09] selfish - amen
[2:01:10] why don't why do you and I why do we
[2:01:13] wrestle sometimes it's for our good
[2:01:18] because it's bad it's
[2:01:20] it's teaching us to crucify that selfish
[2:01:23] nature to crucify the lust of the flesh
[2:01:26] the lust of the eyes and the pride of
[2:01:29] life so I want to close with that do you
[2:01:33] love the Lord today it's always for your
[2:01:36] good musicians if you'll come here but
[2:01:39] hey man let me know if you got a song
[2:01:40] children let me know if you got a song
[2:01:43] everything works together for your good
[2:01:46] if God began when God began the work of
[2:01:51] salvation he'll finish it that's just
[2:01:58] about heads for a moment let's remember
[2:02:00] when God began it I was talking about
[2:02:02] that this morning I remember at that
[2:02:03] athletes and action conference I saw
[2:02:06] that big six foot six red head football
[2:02:08] player from Iowa State raised his hand I
[2:02:10] said Jesse shame on you
[2:02:12] he's six foot tall six six and he can't
[2:02:15] and he can raise his hands and you can't
[2:02:17] I said Lord you've been so good to me
[2:02:19] you heal my momma cancer forgive me and
[2:02:21] I raised my hands right there and gave
[2:02:23] my heart to Christ praise God God began
[2:02:26] a good work praise God and he's faithful
[2:02:30] he will perform it until the day of
[2:02:34] Christ Jesus let's go back to that day

[2:03:24] first day he met that the Lord you know
