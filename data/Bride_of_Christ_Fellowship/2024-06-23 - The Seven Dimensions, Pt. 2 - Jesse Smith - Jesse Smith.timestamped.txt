[0:00] 1 Corinthians uh 15:40 we'll read 40 and
[0:04] then we'll skip down to verse 44 by
[0:06] God's grace I'd like to look at the uh s
[0:08] Dimensions again we looked at it last
[0:09] Sunday night but I feel a little more
[0:11] confident uh preaching it today you know
[0:13] for the whole uh public to see by God's
[0:15] grace I had not studied it as much uh
[0:18] last Sunday but I got more time to study
[0:20] on it and of course I'm more confident
[0:22] in the word of God the Bible said the
[0:23] preacher must study himself approved
[0:25] unto God and so as you as a preacher
[0:28] spends time in the presence of God with
[0:30] the word of God he feels confident that
[0:32] the the truth that he's bringing is the
[0:34] word of God and so that's how I feel
[0:36] this morning and I trust it'll be a help
[0:37] to you uh by the grace of the Lord amen
[0:40] uh to our live streamers you know you
[0:41] may see this as uh part two well part
[0:43] one was not made public so that's why
[0:45] it's part two um and I I'll be reviewing
[0:49] part one of course uh briefly by God's
[0:52] grace so we're looking at part two of
[0:54] the seven dimensions of course I believe
[0:56] there's only two Dimensions but uh I
[0:58] don't make it a dividing topic you know
[1:00] uh this doesn't pertain to Salvation uh
[1:03] but it's a good exercise and rightly
[1:04] dividing the word of God and of course
[1:07] uh dealing with our Dimension praise God
[1:09] hallelujah we know we're not limited
[1:11] just our Dimension praise God our
[1:13] prayers go all the way up to the highest
[1:15] Dimension hallelujah amen so 1
[1:18] Corinthians
[1:20] 15:40 I love how the Bible says that we
[1:22] have access unto the father by one
[1:24] Spirit Hallelujah we have access to the
[1:26] highest Dimension praise God while we're
[1:29] in this dimension
[1:30] so verse 40 I'll read that and then we
[1:32] can all read verse 44 so verse 40 says
[1:34] there are also celestial bodies and
[1:38] bodies terrestrial so Celestial means
[1:40] Heavenly or spiritual and then
[1:43] terrestrial means Earthly or carnal or
[1:46] natural but the glory of the celestial
[1:48] is one and the glory of the testal is
[1:52] another didn't David say I'm fearfully
[1:54] and wonderfully made anyone who has a
[1:56] body can see the glory of the tral body
[2:01] Hallelujah let's read verse 44 together
[2:03] 1 2 3 it is sown a natural body it is
[2:08] raised a spiritual body there is a
[2:11] natural body and there is a spiritual
[2:14] body may God add as a blessing to the
[2:16] reading of his word you can be
[2:20] seated so we look at part two here um I
[2:24] have a lot lot more slides of course to
[2:26] show and then for our uh our you or our
[2:30] live streamers and so forth you know um
[2:32] if you want copies of this let me know
[2:34] I'm not sure why the TV went off there
[2:39] but try to get it back on here if you'd
[2:42] like a copy you can text me of course we
[2:44] do a copy of that send it to you by
[2:46] God's grace now I just found it
[2:48] interesting you know as I Was preparing
[2:49] this
[2:51] U you know 1 Corinthians 15 is all about
[2:53] the Rapture in fact the the the chapter
[2:55] ends verses 51 to 58 with the rapture
[3:00] uh and then right before this Rapture
[3:01] section Paul deals with the method of
[3:05] Resurrection uh in verse 35 you know
[3:08] some men say how are the dead raised
[3:12] up and Paul says uh and with what body
[3:16] do they come and then Paul says Thou
[3:18] fool so it's foolish to think that there
[3:21] is no afterlife it's foolish to think
[3:23] there's only one body right it's foolish
[3:26] to think this is it right and Paul says
[3:30] the natural body when it dies it's being
[3:32] planted like a seed and if you plant a
[3:35] seed it's going to come up so the Bible
[3:37] says when people die it's like they're
[3:39] being planted but they're promised a
[3:41] resurrection praise God so uh it's just
[3:45] a beautiful portion there Paul says it's
[3:46] foolish to think that there is no uh
[3:50] resurrection and the proof of that of
[3:52] course is the two kinds of bodies that
[3:54] Paul tells us about the celestial and
[3:57] the uh uh terrestrial and then then he
[3:59] even gets into the Lord Jesus how the
[4:02] Lord Jesus had a first a uh was a living
[4:06] I'm sorry was a a natural body but then
[4:08] he was made a quickening spirit the
[4:10] Bible tells us a lifegiving
[4:13] spirit so yeah we're trying to connect
[4:15] here so we'll just have to preach and
[4:17] see if we connect here by God's grace
[4:19] that's strange that it went out right
[4:20] now could not connect okay well very
[4:23] sorry about that maybe I'll try a little
[4:24] bit here by God's
[4:26] grace so we see there's uh two kinds of
[4:29] of bodies but then we also learn from
[4:31] the scripture there's two kinds of
[4:33] celestial bodies right there's a a
[4:37] theophany and then there is a glorified
[4:39] body so we see both kind of bodies
[4:41] Hallelujah brother man tells us there
[4:43] are three kinds of bodies and who is
[4:44] this mezic there's first the terrestrial
[4:47] body uh that's the body we live in now
[4:49] so we don't need to spend much time on
[4:51] that we're very familiar with that now
[4:53] this theophany is a little more uh deep
[4:55] uh it's spoken of in 2 Corinthians 1-5
[4:58] Paul said if this if we drop the house
[5:01] of this body we have an eternal house in
[5:03] the heavens not made with Man Hands
[5:05] Hallelujah but it's made with God's
[5:07] hands and it's Eternal which means it
[5:09] was in the mind of God before the
[5:11] foundation of the world Jesus says uh
[5:14] those bodies always Behold our face of
[5:17] the Father which is in heaven amen so
[5:19] there's a section in heaven where the
[5:21] theophanes must be because the Bible
[5:23] said as soon as we go from this one as
[5:25] soon as we leave this one our spirit and
[5:26] soul go to that theophany Hallelujah
[5:28] that body and that body has a white robe
[5:31] Hallelujah uh and brother R says that uh
[5:33] it has no shoes they're Barefeet in that
[5:36] in that uh that Dimension by God's grace
[5:38] so our theophany is white robed
[5:40] Hallelujah and we all look the same as
[5:43] far as the white robe but then we all
[5:45] have our different hair colors brother
[5:46] Ram says everybody's got you know blonde
[5:48] or brown or black whatever you got uh
[5:51] mixture whatever you got red I guess red
[5:53] we'd say uh you have that in that realm
[5:57] and these theop bodies are spiritual
[5:59] bodies and they're Angel bodies they're
[6:01] like Angel bodies they're waiting in
[6:03] heaven when they're not occupied but uh
[6:06] once we die we say if we die we go to
[6:09] occupy that body Hallelujah and then
[6:11] those theophanies can touch other
[6:13] theophanies brother Ram said the women
[6:15] were hugging him the men were hugging
[6:16] him and there was uh there was no
[6:18] hormones there was there was no human
[6:20] hormones there was no uh evil desires
[6:22] there was no evil feelings and we see
[6:24] that also in Daniel 10: 8-10 where the
[6:28] angel that vised Daniel said Michael had
[6:31] to fight with the the Prince of Persia
[6:33] so I could come down and minister to you
[6:36] and he says when I leave you I'll go
[6:37] back and join the fight so there's
[6:40] wrestling uh there's spiritual wrestling
[6:42] of Angels in that Dimension the the the
[6:45] theophany bodies can touch one another
[6:47] and wrestle but we know theophanes do
[6:49] not sleep they do not eat and they do
[6:51] not drink that's right that's what we
[6:53] see from the
[6:55] scripture so we we're comforted by that
[6:57] huah we're comforted that those of us
[6:59] who are believers uh that we if we have
[7:01] loved ones that have passed on we're
[7:03] comforted that that they go to the
[7:05] theophany praise God Amen so there's a
[7:07] theophany picture so I don't know why
[7:08] it's in and out but maybe the internet's
[7:10] in and out I don't know um but we're
[7:13] comforted that think about that all the
[7:15] loved ones we we've known that have
[7:16] passed on we we we know they're in a
[7:18] white robe right now Hallelujah and we
[7:21] know uh they're enjoying the uh they're
[7:23] enjoying their life there a 100 million
[7:25] more times than we're enjoying our life
[7:28] hallelujah amen and then of course
[7:30] there's the glorified body this is what
[7:32] Jesus had when he rose from the dead uh
[7:34] this can be touched by flesh bodies
[7:36] right because Jesus first said don't
[7:38] touch me till I'm ascended and I'm
[7:39] accepted in heaven my blood's accepted
[7:41] on The Mercy Seat in heaven but then he
[7:43] come back down the Bible said they laid
[7:45] his feet and uh we we know other
[7:48] believers touched him as well after the
[7:50] resurrection so it's not a full Spirit
[7:53] body it's a glorified flesh body and it
[7:56] can eat and drink Hallelujah brother
[7:58] Austin and I were talking he had a good
[8:00] thought you know in the future home the
[8:02] Nations will need to eat from the tree
[8:04] of life it's fruit the Bible said
[8:07] they'll eat from the fruit and uh the
[8:08] leaves will be for the healing of
[8:10] Nations and so there's something about
[8:12] our glorified bodies God's going to
[8:13] allow us to eat over there we're going
[8:15] to finally experience the real taste of
[8:17] a good strawberry praise God we're going
[8:19] to really experience what a real orange
[8:21] should taste like without without
[8:23] genetically modified products amen
[8:26] without any anything in the in the soil
[8:28] or anything in the the Agri culture all
[8:29] it's just it's perfect agriculture the
[8:31] way God intended it Hallelujah we'll
[8:34] taste it for what it should have meant
[8:35] to be should have been in the beginning
[8:37] or or what it was in Adam and Eve
[8:39] Hallelujah but we need this body church
[8:42] as we saw we need it for the Millennium
[8:44] Hallelujah uh we need it for the the new
[8:46] city praise God this is the body we'll
[8:48] have in the Millennium and we'll keep
[8:50] that body Hallelujah in fact after the
[8:51] Rapture you know the brother R says
[8:53] first brother said first at the Rapture
[8:55] if we're here on Earth our bodies will
[8:57] get swallowed up by a glorified body and
[8:59] and then he said we'll go to the air to
[9:00] meet our theophany and then all the
[9:03] bodies will be combined into one body
[9:05] and so from the moment from the Rapture
[9:07] through the Millennium and Armageddon on
[9:09] down goag and Magog future home we'll
[9:11] have that body once and for all
[9:13] Hallelujah we'll never more have to come
[9:15] down and descend back down to this uh
[9:18] pest house or this this body of uh
[9:20] corruption the Bible calls it amen
[9:22] hallelujah and I feel like I missed
[9:24] something here uh in this did I miss
[9:26] something okay no and with that thought
[9:28] of mind I I just thought I would share
[9:30] this you know we looked at the
[9:31] Millennium for two services in a row and
[9:33] I I I I feel like the scripture showed
[9:35] me how to differentiate between the
[9:37] Millennium and the future home and if
[9:40] you can understand these few simple
[9:41] points then it's easy to tell which
[9:43] scriptures apply to which time period
[9:46] it's very easy so the Millennium in the
[9:49] Millennium Sinners are still a curse
[9:51] they still deal with curse right but in
[9:53] revelation 22 the Bible said there's no
[9:54] more curse amen so whatever the whatever
[9:58] the context of the scripture is telling
[9:59] about it's easy to place it because
[10:01] there's only two
[10:03] choices it's very very simple right so
[10:06] and that's what I love God is always
[10:07] revealed in Simplicity right and then
[10:10] the Millennium Nations can be deceived
[10:13] but the Bible said in revelation 22 the
[10:15] nations are
[10:16] healed right there's no more there's no
[10:18] more of anything there's no more
[10:20] deception no more wrongs nothing it it's
[10:23] total healing Hallelujah then the third
[10:25] one you know Nations can be destroyed
[10:27] the Bible said the fire comes out and
[10:28] destroy on the Nations that Satan
[10:32] deceives and uh so there's death there's
[10:34] still death during this time period but
[10:37] Revelation 21:4 the Bible said when the
[10:39] New Jerusalem comes down there's no more
[10:41] death Hallelujah so no curse total
[10:44] healing and there's no death in the
[10:46] future home the New Jerusalem so with
[10:49] that scriptural Foundation it's very
[10:51] easy then to place them and uh uh
[10:54] brother Chad Lamb gave the jungman city
[10:56] Saints a nice board and that's your
[10:58] pastor's drawing that's my best time not
[10:59] I could draw freehand without the help
[11:01] of a computer so I drew that on Thursday
[11:04] night there uh of course I only I tried
[11:06] to limit my preaching but I realized as
[11:08] I was preaching there's no curse here
[11:10] but there is curses during the time of
[11:12] the Millennium so if you want to copy
[11:14] that I can easily send that to you but
[11:15] I'll try to make a better uh digital
[11:18] copy of that by God's
[11:20] grace so let's just quickly re review
[11:23] you know part one of the seven
[11:24] dimensions brother Ram said every
[11:26] Doctrine everything else must be based
[11:28] upon the word of God must come from the
[11:30] word of God not just one place but it's
[11:32] got to be Genesis the Revelation saying
[11:34] the same thing and we can't base our
[11:36] thoughts upon one little scripture right
[11:40] and then he says you know we must prove
[11:42] All Things by the scripture if it's
[11:44] contrary to my faith yet the scripture
[11:46] says so the scripture is right and I'm
[11:48] wrong the scripture is always right the
[11:50] only way to do anything is to come back
[11:52] to the
[11:54] scripture and brother R said even when
[11:56] they he did questions and answers way
[11:57] back in 57 he said said just remember I
[12:00] can be wrong I don't claim to be right
[12:02] on everything that I do I try to be
[12:04] right but maybe I'm wrong and if I am
[12:06] wrong then you just forgive me and I
[12:08] pray God will too because I don't mean
[12:10] to be wrong I just try to answer them
[12:13] the way that I just for uh not Prejudice
[12:16] I try to answer them the very best of my
[12:18] knowledge and if I have to alter my
[12:20] ideas on a Bible question I think that's
[12:22] just the thing to do we should alter any
[12:24] time when God speaks God's word because
[12:26] it's God's word amen and of course you
[12:29] know that if you as you listen to
[12:31] brother random down through the years he
[12:33] changes on almost every topic and how
[12:36] can you blame him he was raised a son of
[12:38] a drunkard he wasn't even raised in
[12:41] church from what I understand he didn't
[12:43] go to church till he got saved at 19 if
[12:44] I'm not mistaken 19 or 20 he got saved
[12:47] so imagine if you never went to church
[12:49] for the first 19 or 20 years of your
[12:51] life and then you went to church you
[12:53] know you would be learning things the
[12:55] first time it would take you many years
[12:57] to really find the the Deep truth of God
[12:59] in the scripture praise God now brother
[13:02] ads accuser was called flip-flops but
[13:04] that's sad shame on them but they
[13:07] flip-flopped on many things they were in
[13:09] the message and they left the message so
[13:10] they
[13:11] flip-flopped right so uh we just must be
[13:15] humble praise God we must all know that
[13:17] God's helping us all to grow in Grace
[13:18] and knowledge of the Lord now many other
[13:20] quotes I'm skipping those U and this
[13:22] doesn't pertain to Salvation it's a now
[13:25] the study on seven dimensions is a small
[13:26] study there's about 28 hits on it um
[13:29] it's very it's small you know even
[13:31] compared to third poll there's 54 quotes
[13:33] on that it's very similar to something
[13:34] like 1977 a very small sample of
[13:38] quotes uh and again uh brother there's
[13:40] many things brother Ram says uh he
[13:42] doesn't have thus sayith the Lord on it
[13:44] and he he says if I don't have thus
[13:46] sayith the Lord on it then I don't have
[13:47] anything from the Lord on it and he said
[13:49] that's just my
[13:51] opinion and there is a quote brother cam
[13:54] preached lately too I I don't have it
[13:55] ready but but brother man said my
[13:57] opinion is no better than anybody else's
[13:59] opinion now that's quite a statement to
[14:01] say now we would all think well no
[14:03] brother R your opinion is better than
[14:05] others you know but he said my opinion
[14:07] is no better than anybody else's so if
[14:10] you believe brother brandom then you
[14:11] understand brother brandham right you
[14:13] don't try to exalt anyone else remember
[14:15] brother Brandon one place said there's
[14:16] eight Dimensions so if you believe every
[14:18] words thus say the Lord boy you are you
[14:20] you got a problem Hallelujah CU because
[14:22] you're you're saying there's seven but
[14:23] then brother Bram said there's eight
[14:25] okay so here's my my this is all of our
[14:27] previous understanding right until this
[14:29] year right I was tell my wife I said I
[14:31] feel like this year God's opened up a
[14:32] lot of wonderful Revelation just this
[14:35] year uh you know on the book of Romans
[14:38] and here the dimensions and the uh the
[14:41] Millennium uh different different
[14:43] thoughts and subjects I've never had
[14:44] before you know uh going deeper in the
[14:46] word of God and I'm thankful for that
[14:48] praise God so here's where people get
[14:50] seven you know in the region we live
[14:52] they think there's four right and then
[14:54] they say the fifth is Hell which also
[14:57] has regions sixth would be the region of
[14:59] the
[15:00] sav uh Under The Altar and then you
[15:03] seventh would be the very altar of God
[15:06] uh the seventh
[15:08] Dimension now after watching a highly
[15:10] recommended sermon like I said I asked I
[15:12] asked myself does the bible teach seven
[15:14] dimensions and my my humble answer was
[15:16] no I I don't see the Bible ever saying
[15:18] there's seven dimensions like it doesn't
[15:20] say those words seven dimensions so I
[15:22] knew I had to study it and I believe
[15:24] after studying there's just two
[15:25] Dimensions there's Celestial and
[15:27] terrestrial or I could just call
[15:29] Heavenly spiritual or terrestrial or
[15:32] Earthly that's the way I see it now by
[15:35] God's grace cuz if you if you go study
[15:36] the word Dimension there's there's over
[15:38] five definitions of the word Dimension
[15:40] there's there's lots of ways to Define
[15:42] it the only one that makes sense to me
[15:44] is a level of existence or
[15:46] Consciousness okay that's what a
[15:48] dimension is you're you're you're
[15:50] existing
[15:51] somewhere now what's amazing is that
[15:53] Jesus said the son of man which is in
[15:55] heaven when he was on
[15:57] Earth so so there's Jesus had an
[16:00] existence where he was existing both on
[16:02] Earth and in heaven at the same time I
[16:05] would say you do too because the Bible
[16:06] says we're seated in Heavenly places in
[16:08] Christ Jesus amen hallelujah and we have
[16:12] an eternal house in the heavens
[16:14] Hallelujah and that's the more real
[16:16] version of us brother William right
[16:19] brother said that realm is more real
[16:21] than this realm Hallelujah so I have a
[16:23] real body that's more real than this one
[16:25] and it's in heaven hallelujah amen
[16:28] that's what the Bible says
[16:29] amen prise God so if we're seated in
[16:31] Heavenly
[16:32] places that means we have a a house we
[16:34] have a body that's in heaven and it
[16:37] dwells in heaven hallelujah amen it's a
[16:39] We Exist there right but we just live in
[16:42] our souls here though right uh like
[16:45] brother M said it's unoccupied that
[16:47] theophan is there but it's unoccupied
[16:49] we're our spirit and soul occupy this
[16:51] Dimension here amen but there is a part
[16:53] of us that exists somewhere else amen
[16:56] hallelujah so it seems there's only two
[16:58] levels of
[17:02] existence and the Bible shows people
[17:04] being conscience in both existences yeah
[17:08] now what I mean by that um and maybe I
[17:11] didn't word that the right way but even
[17:13] the Jews under the altar they have
[17:16] they're existing there right but they're
[17:18] aware that they haven't been Avenged on
[17:20] the
[17:21] earth okay then you have the the rich
[17:24] man Jesus told the parable the rich man
[17:26] of Lazarus the the rich man is there in
[17:29] the heart of the earth he's in Hell he's
[17:31] in torment in the prison house but yet
[17:33] he's still aware of his brothers up
[17:35] there on Earth because they haven't died
[17:37] yet he's aware they haven't died yeah so
[17:39] he's existing there but he's conscious
[17:41] that wow there my brothers aren't here I
[17:44] don't see would have known yeah so uh
[17:47] and as as Jesus said you know as Jesus
[17:49] said the son of man which is in heaven
[17:51] now I'm not ready to preach on that
[17:52] verse I need to I just always thought it
[17:55] as um God being able to to exist
[17:58] everywhere
[17:59] simultaneously how God is all powerful
[18:01] omniscient Hallelujah omnipresent by for
[18:04] knowledge yeah but also how uh we would
[18:07] say the spirit of Christ uh was the the
[18:10] holy ghost that was in Christ was also
[18:12] in heaven because you can't limit God's
[18:14] presence
[18:15] Hallelujah now so I believe there's two
[18:17] Dimensions we have uh or two elements or
[18:20] two areas of Consciousness you have you
[18:22] have uh the Heavenly the celestial and
[18:24] the Earthly and now we went through
[18:26] these verses already but I'll just read
[18:28] them briefly
[18:29] God Alone made heaven and earth Isaiah
[18:33] 37:16 Isaiah 44:24 I the Lord that
[18:36] maketh all things that stretch forth the
[18:38] heavens alone that spread abroad the
[18:41] Earth by myself so God stretched out the
[18:44] heavens and then God spread about the
[18:46] Earth and he even said it the Bible said
[18:48] he even set it on foundations amen the
[18:51] Earth is on foundations invisible
[18:53] foundations hallelujah amen other words
[18:55] the earth the earth is on founding
[18:57] pillars right it's hanging there on
[18:59] invisible pillars Hallelujah by the
[19:01] power of God brother R said the Unseen
[19:03] World is more real than the
[19:06] scen he uh you know he's having this
[19:09] debate and he says anything that can be
[19:12] scientific scientifically proven that I
[19:14] think there's nothing to it but I said I
[19:16] don't like to be different but I have to
[19:17] be now the things that can be
[19:19] scientifically proven is not real it's
[19:22] only the things that's not
[19:23] scientifically proven is real he said
[19:25] that's ridiculous I said all right I
[19:26] want to ask you something can you tell
[19:28] me what love is could you scientifically
[19:30] show me what love is go down to the
[19:31] drugstore and buy me a quarter's worth
[19:33] of
[19:34] love I need some more see you can't see
[19:37] it it's the Unseen show me what life is
[19:39] I need a just a little more life could
[19:42] you buy me a quarter's worth show me
[19:45] what life is show me what love is what
[19:47] personality is what the holy spirit is
[19:49] what God is it's the Unseen things
[19:51] that's real lasting these things are
[19:53] temporal and perishable here on Earth
[19:56] right and brother BR had that one debate
[19:58] and uh the the the man with the a
[20:01] atheist and he said he said I don't
[20:02] believe in anything that can be seen and
[20:04] brother Ram kind of made a joke at the
[20:06] end he said well I don't believe in your
[20:08] uh I he said show me your mind he said I
[20:10] can't show it to you then brother R said
[20:11] I don't believe in
[20:13] you right because I can't see your mind
[20:15] show it to me right and that and that
[20:18] deals with this as well there's a realm
[20:21] scientists can't prove they can't prove
[20:22] where's the mind they can't tap into
[20:25] that they can't see that Unseen World
[20:27] but it's just it's more real than this
[20:28] one hallelujah amen the Unseen your mind
[20:31] your spirit your soul is more real than
[20:33] this hallelujah amen because the this is
[20:37] temporal this is perishable but the soul
[20:40] that's got the spirit of God is eternal
[20:42] hallelujah amen and here he says it more
[20:45] plainly he said the holy spirit is more
[20:47] real than the
[20:48] sunshine amen the sun will fail but the
[20:51] Holy Spirit Can't Fail amen it don't
[20:54] only light for the sense of light but it
[20:55] lights for the soul a light of Glory
[20:57] that leads us to God that re that
[20:59] projects rather Calvary to us and the
[21:01] sufferings of our Lord Jesus the
[21:03] oncoming judgment and the Escape for
[21:05] those who want to come I'd rather be
[21:07] totally blind physically and have my
[21:09] spiritual sight Hallelujah than to be
[21:11] totally blind spiritually and have my
[21:13] physical sight I want to have spiritual
[21:15] sight other words I want the thing
[21:17] that's Eternal Hallelujah am our if we
[21:20] lose our natural U capacities or
[21:23] abilities it'd be better at least to
[21:26] have the spiritual capacity because that
[21:28] contacts the Eternal World Hallelujah
[21:31] God's world
[21:32] Amen so this is my little sample again
[21:34] out of the invisible God came a out of
[21:38] the invisible Spirit came a visible
[21:40] Spirit
[21:42] realm the first thing that he made of
[21:44] course was the the logos to live in this
[21:46] spiritual
[21:47] realm right and out of Christ Christ
[21:49] created all things so Christ created
[21:52] this this Physical Realm that can be
[21:54] seen in the
[21:55] physical so this is the Earthly or
[21:57] physical or ter Dimension but it's
[22:00] inside the spiritual Dimension that God
[22:02] made first the spiritual is more
[22:05] real this is more real so the realm of
[22:07] Angels the realm of God's Dr that's more
[22:09] real amen than the realm we live in and
[22:13] so this is a visible this is the the
[22:15] celestial realm that God made and then
[22:17] inside of this or we say overlapping
[22:20] this is this physical Dimension or
[22:23] layered maybe layered on top right you
[22:25] have the spiritual Dimension but then
[22:26] there's got to be a terrestrial
[22:27] dimension
[22:29] now that's the the and and you know I I
[22:31] I just say you know I can fit all the
[22:33] seven dimensions in these two because in
[22:35] the terrestrial you have light matter
[22:38] time and science right because even with
[22:41] the frequencies like I said the
[22:42] frequencies like the the cell phone
[22:43] signals and uh the signals to the
[22:45] satellites those don't reach up to God's
[22:47] Throne right God doesn't need an
[22:48] internet connection to contact us right
[22:51] so all four of those are inside this
[22:54] terrestrial which I also call the first
[22:56] heaven but then you have the celest
[22:58] which is Hell paradise and God's Throne
[23:01] that's all in the spiritual
[23:03] realm where demons are right where
[23:05] angels are where God is amen where souls
[23:09] are where Spirits are
[23:11] amen so they they all fit inside of the
[23:14] two so I'm not taking any anything away
[23:17] from this I just have a different way of
[23:18] seeing it praise God right I'm just
[23:20] going to use it the Bible definitions
[23:22] for it m but if you're talking to me and
[23:24] all you know or somebody talking to me
[23:26] on the internet and all you know is the
[23:27] fifth dimension I can talk to you about
[23:29] that I understand I understand what
[23:30] you're talking about that's not going to
[23:32] hinder me from understanding you it's
[23:34] not going to hinder us from
[23:35] understanding one another yeah but if
[23:37] I'm just using Bible words these are the
[23:39] Bible words you don't see these words in
[23:41] the Bible right all
[23:44] right now the third heaven now to
[23:47] understand the third heaven I'll just
[23:48] skip to the third heaven Paul says I
[23:50] knew a man in Christ about 14 years ago
[23:53] whether in the body I cannot tell or
[23:54] whether out of the body I cannot tell
[23:56] God knoweth such and one caught up to
[23:59] the third heaven so I believe there's
[24:00] third three Heavens the first heaven for
[24:03] us is uh what we see we can see Earth
[24:07] the atmosphere Space Universe and Beyond
[24:10] hopefully one of these days brother
[24:11] William we can look through a good
[24:12] telescope and really see out there you
[24:14] know but we'd only be seeing the first
[24:16] Heaven Hallelujah that's the terrestrial
[24:19] remember these are all galaxies and in
[24:21] each Galaxy is billions of stars right
[24:24] each galaxy has billions so wherever the
[24:26] Milky Way is you know maybe it's that
[24:27] little one I don't know
[24:29] there's billions of stars in there but
[24:31] we're the only planet with life out of
[24:33] all these trillions and trillions of
[24:35] stars that's the first heaven now the
[24:38] second heaven is where the saved
[24:41] go right the the saved now brother R
[24:45] says these are the Jews under the altar
[24:47] in heaven the altar of incense the
[24:49] prayers right because they're praying
[24:52] right when will you avenge us Lord see
[24:53] that they're praying yeah now there's
[24:56] some other realm brother tells us that's
[24:57] far from this where we live brother R
[25:00] said I turned around it's beautiful
[25:02] brother brother raham said he looked at
[25:04] his body laying there right when he left
[25:06] his body MH in the beyond the current of
[25:08] time he said I turned around and it was
[25:10] a field MH and then all the sisters come
[25:13] running to me they all hugged me and
[25:16] then the brothers came running to
[25:18] me hallelujah amen yeah he just turned
[25:21] around he was lifted up from the bed he
[25:24] said then he was standing in some
[25:25] spiritual Dimension hallelujah praise
[25:27] God Amen
[25:28] right so he looked and there's a field
[25:31] so there's this in in the sixth
[25:32] Dimension somewhere there's called a
[25:34] paradise amen amen and that's where all
[25:37] the Saints Go hallelujah amen but then
[25:40] maybe F further from that somewhere
[25:42] there's this altar of incense where the
[25:44] Jews go and I'd say the foolish virgin
[25:47] uhhuh because they're under the altar
[25:49] crying oh Lord holy and true how long
[25:52] does thou make until thou avenge blood
[25:55] upon the Earth and make war and avenge
[25:57] us amen
[25:59] and the Lord answers them back just a
[26:00] little short season more of your people
[26:02] need to be martyred and then I'll avenge
[26:05] your blood on the
[26:06] earth so each one of these is a Jewish
[26:08] Soul Jewish soul and I I believe that's
[26:12] the second heaven I can't prove that but
[26:14] all I know is that Paul said he was
[26:16] lifted up in the highest Dimension there
[26:18] was three Heavens right right this is
[26:22] this is my best understanding and I I'm
[26:24] open to correction but I just want to be
[26:26] humble praise God I don't I don't know
[26:28] I'm just saying the best I can and the
[26:30] third I love this picture isn't a
[26:31] beautiful man there's a rainbow around
[26:33] the throne Hallelujah you got the 24
[26:36] ouers you got the four beasts just like
[26:38] the Bible says now we just need the
[26:40] seven spirits of God somewhere I don't
[26:41] know where that is but at least we got
[26:42] the seven golden candlesticks amen we
[26:44] got most of that amen they're just
[26:46] missing a few things up there just a
[26:48] beautiful picture now that's God's
[26:50] Throne
[26:54] Hallelujah now and then what's further
[26:56] Beyond this brother Ram says that when
[26:58] the lamb came forth to take a book so I
[27:00] don't know where maybe the book would go
[27:02] here or something but man said he came
[27:04] out of the holiest of holies where he
[27:06] was making intercession well the Bible
[27:08] says there's a holiest of holies in
[27:10] heaven so is just this Throne the
[27:12] holiest or is there some old some place
[27:14] behind the throne where there's a holies
[27:16] of holies chamber I don't
[27:19] know but remember this was in the uh the
[27:22] the the altar of incest was in the Holy
[27:25] place but not the most holy place right
[27:29] right now what's interesting is the uh
[27:32] the seven golden candlesticks are there
[27:34] in the holiest now that's
[27:36] interesting right CU before they were in
[27:39] the most holy place in Moses's
[27:42] Tabernacle and Solomon's Tabernacle so I
[27:44] can't understand everything but I'm just
[27:46] taking the Bible for what it says
[27:47] because I know the Bible won't tell me a
[27:49] lie
[27:50] Hallelujah there's just some greater
[27:52] Revelation he's going to need all
[27:54] eternity to explain all this to us
[27:56] hallelujah hallelujah
[27:59] so see there there's a third heaven and
[28:01] then there's the all Heavens he uh he
[28:04] Jesus ascended I'm sorry Jesus that
[28:07] descended is the same also that ascended
[28:09] up before I'm sorry far above all
[28:12] Heavens that he might fill all
[28:15] things so Jesus filled this realm but
[28:17] then he also fills the other Realms as
[28:19] well so there's more than one heaven and
[28:22] Paul tells us there's at least three so
[28:24] that's my best to understand it and then
[28:26] Paul thought well maybe I was caught in
[28:27] the third
[28:29] Heaven Paul said how that he was caught
[28:31] up into Paradise he heard unspeakable
[28:34] Words which is not lawful for a man to
[28:36] utter now the word Paradise in the Greek
[28:39] doesn't mean this that it used to be in
[28:40] Paradise in the heart of the Earth but
[28:42] now it's the upper regions of the
[28:44] heavens upper yeah right so there's
[28:48] there's a realm of heaven but then
[28:50] there's a higher Realm Of Heaven yeah
[28:52] Hallelujah which we would say if Paul
[28:54] was caught into Paradise that's either
[28:56] the sixth Dimension or the second heaven
[29:00] not to be
[29:01] confusing or he was caught up into the
[29:03] very Throne of God the third
[29:05] heaven
[29:07] okay so now this is for the children if
[29:10] you haven't heard these so the order of
[29:13] creation was first God stretched forth a
[29:16] spiritual Dimension God made a Celestial
[29:18] space to live in that's the first thing
[29:21] because he would he fed all he he's he's
[29:23] infinite he didn't have a limit to the
[29:25] space he lived in he was an infinite
[29:28] Spirit but then he created a spiritual
[29:31] space that could be seen yeah okay he
[29:34] stretched forth the heaven and he
[29:35] stretched that forth God stretched out
[29:37] this the spiritual Celestial realm
[29:40] Hallelujah and so after that then the
[29:43] logos was created so the logos could
[29:46] have a
[29:47] place
[29:48] right so and then this was of course the
[29:51] third heaven or the seventh Dimension
[29:53] was created next so the logos had a
[29:56] throne right so he created the the logos
[29:58] but then the logos needed a throne to
[30:00] dwell in yeah to be seen and worshiped
[30:03] by the
[30:03] Angels right so the next thing then
[30:06] would have been after the logos would
[30:08] have been this
[30:09] heavens and then after the logos was
[30:12] created and he's got a throne in heaven
[30:14] then he creates the angel so he could re
[30:16] worshiped hallelujah amen he still
[30:18] hasn't created the Earth yet
[30:21] right and then the logos of course
[30:24] created this terrestrial or Earthly
[30:26] Dimension so the first thing we have is
[30:29] the space and we got the logos uh the
[30:31] Bible said oh yeah the Bible said he was
[30:33] rejoicing always before him so when God
[30:35] made this first logos or Pillar of Fire
[30:37] that logos was rejoicing before the
[30:39] invisible Spirit that's what Proverbs
[30:42] 8:30 says I wisdom was rejoicing before
[30:46] the father before there was even a
[30:48] foundation of the world Hallelujah talk
[30:51] about some good father and son time
[30:53] there that's what they had at the
[30:54] beginning remember Jesus said Lord give
[30:57] them the glory which the the same Glory
[30:59] or no Jesus said glorify me with the
[31:01] glory that we had before the foundation
[31:03] of the world Amen John 17:5 Hallelujah
[31:06] so that's the glory Jesus had the glory
[31:08] that was the son of God he shared the
[31:10] glory of the invisible father he was the
[31:12] visible image of it
[31:14] amen and that's what brother Ram said in
[31:16] 1953 he said now we can't see nothing
[31:19] yet but by just eyes of Supernatural we
[31:21] see a Halo sitting there that's that
[31:23] Halo I was talking that's the
[31:25] Halo now that's the Son of God the L God
[31:28] now I can see him playing around like a
[31:30] little child before the father's door
[31:32] with all
[31:34] eternity so Jesus is just playing before
[31:36] the father there having a a play time
[31:39] having a worship time we'd say or maybe
[31:41] rejoicing time the Bible say it's a
[31:43] dancing time a singing time a rejoicing
[31:45] time Hallelujah and now in in his
[31:49] imaginary makeup he began to think of
[31:50] what things would be and I can hear him
[31:52] say let there be light and when he did
[31:54] an Adam burst and the sun came into
[31:56] existence she world around hundreds of
[31:58] billions millions of years forming like
[32:00] clinkers and burning and forming like it
[32:02] is today still burning still breaking
[32:07] atoms so now the the order was again
[32:09] remember you have the son by himself
[32:10] with the father but then the son created
[32:13] this heavenly realm that beautiful
[32:14] picture I
[32:15] just right somewhere you got God's
[32:18] throne in there remember Satan wanted to
[32:20] try to ascend above the clouds the Bible
[32:22] said we we talked that last
[32:25] week yeah here's where Lucifer said it
[32:27] Lucifer said I will Ascend into heaven
[32:29] I'll exalt my throne above the stars of
[32:31] God so God had a throne somewhere and
[32:33] Satan said I can exalt my throne above
[32:35] that amen right he said I'll sit upon
[32:38] the Mount of the congregation in the
[32:41] sides of the north so you want to go to
[32:42] the north side of
[32:44] heaven and uh live on the mountain of
[32:47] the congregation of angels I will send
[32:49] above the heights of the clouds there's
[32:51] the clouds again he wanted to ascend
[32:53] above that so see God had to create a
[32:55] spiritual space right he had to create a
[32:58] a Celestial uh atmosphere of existence
[33:02] Hallelujah but I love what the Bible
[33:04] said Thou shalt be brought down to Hell
[33:06] to the sides of the north of Hell amen
[33:08] amen so now that the logos has created
[33:11] this now he can start creating uh the
[33:13] natural realm so brother said so my
[33:16] opinion the first thing he made was
[33:17] Angels then they worshiped him that made
[33:19] him God now the Angels began to worship
[33:22] him that was before there was ever a
[33:24] molecule on Earth he says that was way
[33:27] back before the Earth cuz remember
[33:29] brother R said the Angels shouted the
[33:31] stars and morning Stars sang together
[33:33] when the foundations of the earth were
[33:35] laid Hallelujah so when God made this
[33:39] and then God put the Earth in here then
[33:41] all the Angels were rejoicing and saying
[33:43] glory to God in the highest amen I'm
[33:46] going to create life in another realm
[33:48] that's what Job 38 says hallelujah so
[33:52] God had already created the Angels but
[33:53] the Angels were Witnesses of God
[33:55] creating the Earth and I like what
[33:56] brother Braham says brother Ram says uh
[33:59] now he made the sun now the first thing
[34:01] you know a big clinker fell off from it
[34:03] weighed about just about this Earth so
[34:04] brother Ram just was dramatizing he said
[34:07] maybe the Earth came out of the
[34:09] sun right and then this logos here the
[34:12] Son of God is watching this Earth come
[34:14] out of the
[34:15] sun and the logos let that Earth fall
[34:19] for he says a 100 million
[34:22] years and then he stops it stop right
[34:25] there so whichever realm you know he let
[34:27] it come where I don't know where the sun
[34:29] is in here but he let it fall for a
[34:32] million billion years and says stop
[34:34] right there
[34:36] mhm and God did that with all the stars
[34:38] and the church said amen and the Bible
[34:40] said he knows them all by name church he
[34:42] knows about your situation today praise
[34:44] God be that and that's easy to him this
[34:47] is easy to him Hallelujah nothing can
[34:49] hinder God if God knows all about that
[34:52] God's Watching Over You Hallelujah God's
[34:54] placed you right where you are
[34:55] Hallelujah if he placed a son the moon
[34:58] where they are then God place you where
[35:00] you are
[35:01] Hallelujah he said then another one
[35:03] flies off he lets it fall for a million
[35:05] years and then he stops that
[35:07] one brother said what is he doing he's
[35:09] writing his
[35:10] Bible amen he's writing the story of
[35:13] Creation in the skies
[35:16] Hallelujah so are their Dimensions
[35:18] blending now this is a little different
[35:20] thought I don't think they're blending I
[35:22] think they've always just had access one
[35:24] to
[35:25] another okay that's just my thought I
[35:28] think the terestrial has always
[35:29] overlapped the celestial since the
[35:31] celestial was created first and is more
[35:34] real than the terestrial
[35:36] right think about this since Adam and
[35:38] Eve's time there's always been evil
[35:40] spirits that used to be in the celestial
[35:42] realm and they can actively come in the
[35:45] terrestrial
[35:47] realm since Adam and Eve right right
[35:50] because the Bible said Satan was an Eid
[35:52] in the garden of God well Satan's a
[35:54] Celestial being yeah he's not flesh and
[35:56] blood
[35:58] yeah right but he entered into the Flesh
[36:00] and Blood of the serpent in order to
[36:01] produce a Serpent's Seed that's
[36:04] right right but then he left the serpent
[36:06] then after that because he's a spiritual
[36:08] being he's a Celestial being and even
[36:11] God even the even the spirit of God the
[36:14] theophany of God Amen would come down
[36:16] and walk in the garden
[36:19] naturally I just had that thought too at
[36:21] the burning bush what kind of fire was
[36:22] that that wasn't a natural fire right
[36:25] that was a holy fire Hallelujah that was
[36:27] a Celestial fire Hallelujah coming down
[36:30] and acting like it's burning up a bush
[36:32] but it's not really Burning It Up
[36:34] hallelujah it's just looking like it's
[36:36] burning amen amen so these Celestial
[36:39] beings and the presence of God are just
[36:41] actively constantly moving in and out
[36:44] and then go a little deeper what about
[36:46] you you're inside of you is a spiritual
[36:49] being and how many know there's evil
[36:52] spirits battling you throughout the day
[36:54] trying to get in here yeah so they're
[36:57] just allowed they're they just have
[36:59] access but they can't do anything unless
[37:01] they get permission from God hallelujah
[37:03] amen right that's right and then you in
[37:06] your spiritual mind like I told those
[37:08] some of those Saints we were going
[37:09] through some mind battles on Thursday I
[37:10] said cast it down and I was explaining
[37:13] you know the the spiritual things just
[37:15] cast it down put it under your feet
[37:18] spiritually not naturally you can stop
[37:20] all day you'll still have mind battles
[37:22] but spiritually you can cast it down in
[37:24] other words don't think about it anymore
[37:25] say get behind me Satan Hallelujah amen
[37:29] it doesn't have to be in our thoughts it
[37:30] doesn't have to be in the spiritual
[37:31] realm inside of us so we' got a
[37:33] Celestial existence inside of us
[37:35] hallelujah amen amen everybody catch
[37:38] that you got a celestial spirit and soul
[37:40] inside of you right but it's it's it's
[37:43] it's inside this body in a trust World
[37:46] hallelujah amen brother R said I'm a
[37:48] spiritual being living in a natural life
[37:51] hallelujah we're Spiritual Beings living
[37:53] in a natural world hallelujah amen and
[37:57] it just the way we live just manifests
[37:59] what's on the inside oh May the spirit
[38:01] of God manifest through our lives
[38:03] Hallelujah more and more so people can
[38:05] see wow they're not of this world this
[38:07] brother brother amen is a brother of a
[38:09] different world hallelujah amen he's not
[38:11] of this world Amen he came from Heaven
[38:13] hallelujah amen amen each one of us but
[38:16] they can say this world is not our home
[38:19] amen I'll say this until the New
[38:20] Jerusalem comes down
[38:23] amen see I mean uh these the beings have
[38:28] access to the terrestrial at the plan of
[38:31] God or the per or the will of God I'll
[38:33] say like
[38:35] that remember uh and notice in church
[38:38] that there was there was a certain day
[38:40] there's a certain day on God's Celestial
[38:41] calendar not our calendar God Celestial
[38:44] cander where all the demons have to
[38:46] report what have you been up to where
[38:49] you been going look what God asked him
[38:50] when when comes thou where you been now
[38:53] God knows where those demons have been
[38:55] but God wants them to tell tell the
[38:57] truth cuz they cause they Cause people
[39:00] to lie so God wants them to tell the
[39:02] truth hallelujah and so they all have to
[39:06] report on a certain day up to heaven
[39:09] isn't that wonderful when you don't feel
[39:10] those spirits around you very much
[39:12] Hallelujah they're reporting to to God
[39:15] Amen that's what the Bible calls a
[39:17] season of rest Hallelujah remember the
[39:19] devil left Jesus for a season hallelujah
[39:21] amen and so the demons that battle us
[39:23] that's why I told one of the brothers
[39:24] too I said you know we're just going to
[39:25] go through battles it's going to be one
[39:27] of the it's going to be either lust of
[39:28] the eyes lust of the fresh pride of life
[39:29] you're going to battle one more than the
[39:31] other true right but I said enjoy those
[39:34] seasons of
[39:35] rest but get yourself stronger because
[39:38] you know the devil's coming back
[39:41] Hallelujah CU here we can see they leave
[39:43] they got to go report for a season
[39:45] that's when we can enjoy we can live on
[39:47] the Mountaintop by God's grace amen amen
[39:50] hallelujah but then the Lord gives them
[39:52] permission he says behold all that job
[39:54] hath is in thy power only on himself put
[39:57] forth on hand now we know he got access
[39:59] to his body after this right in Chapter
[40:01] 2 so we can see that these uh Celestial
[40:05] beings have constant access to the
[40:07] terrestrial realm amen so I don't think
[40:10] they're blending I just feel like they
[40:11] just they've always had access yeah
[40:14] right so my opinion there's no blending
[40:17] the only blending is the New Jerusalem
[40:19] amen because heaven goes down to earth
[40:21] Jesus said I go to prepare a place for
[40:23] you that where I am there ye may be also
[40:26] Hallelujah amen and who's Jesus Jesus Is
[40:29] God he's king of kings and Lord of lords
[40:32] amen so the final event we see is heaven
[40:34] uh the Throne of Heaven coming down to
[40:36] earth and now it's Blended all together
[40:38] Hallelujah that that's my humble opinion
[40:41] by God's grace because all demonic and
[40:44] Holy Ghost activity in the terrestrial
[40:46] Dimension uh it goes on until the New
[40:50] Jerusalem but this is a good thought too
[40:52] this was brother William and I were
[40:54] talking about this church throughout
[40:56] time of human history there's increasing
[40:58] and decreasing of demonic
[41:00] activity it all depends if the people
[41:03] open themselves up to the spirit of God
[41:05] like I visited Charles finny uh his
[41:08] grave and we learned about Charles finy
[41:10] there was such a holy atmosphere where
[41:12] they wouldn't even wear tight clothes
[41:14] the whole city think about that a whole
[41:16] city with sisters dressed holy oh it's a
[41:18] it's a prefigure to the Millennium amen
[41:21] they they almost had like a prefigure to
[41:23] the mum imagine a whole city where no
[41:26] one smokes cigarettes they had it yeah
[41:29] when they established some of these
[41:30] early cities in America even early
[41:33] States think about that they had such a
[41:37] an atmosphere see the spirits weren't
[41:40] able to work on them they had such
[41:41] overcoming power amen amen but then
[41:45] people backslide and now I thought today
[41:47] what would Charles finny say if he could
[41:49] walk down the street today see these
[41:51] crazy dressed women half naked women
[41:53] hair colors look like the rainbow purple
[41:54] green orange and pink and what would you
[41:56] say now he' probably pass
[41:58] out sometimes we feel like passing out
[42:01] but look the days and know we're so
[42:03] wicked God stopped striving with men now
[42:05] what what does striving mean God was
[42:06] pleading with man so God was sending his
[42:09] holy spirit angels to try to deal with
[42:11] these people but they so many of them
[42:13] grieved him
[42:14] away that it it was as if there was
[42:17] there was more demon activity on the
[42:19] earth because they grieved the spirit of
[42:21] God away amen but the dimensions weren't
[42:24] blending there was just more activity of
[42:26] the demonic realm because of the love of
[42:29] iniquity and that's what the Bible said
[42:31] repeats in this day Jesus said because
[42:33] the love iniquity uh evil seducers will
[42:36] wax worse and worse amen right because
[42:39] the love of many has grown cold oh you
[42:42] should feel so good if you love the
[42:43] people in here amen you should feel so
[42:45] wonderful if you know the love of God is
[42:47] in my heart and I want to love my
[42:49] brothers and sisters and I even want to
[42:50] love Sinners hallelujah amen because
[42:53] that's what the world is lacking the
[42:55] world is lacking the real love of Jesus
[42:57] Christ amen they don't have that because
[42:59] it's withdrawn off their life they
[43:01] grieve the holy spirit so much they
[43:03] don't love one another we should be so
[43:05] grateful if we love people and people
[43:07] love us amen hallelujah you can read
[43:11] that in Genesis 6 1-13 now did you know
[43:14] brother said the the sixth Church age
[43:16] was the age of the open door where the
[43:18] Pope's power was decreased think about
[43:21] that during the Philadelphian Church age
[43:23] with all those wonderful missionaries uh
[43:26] John living Stone and William Cary
[43:29] that's that's he's a very famous one to
[43:31] India and all the missionary work the
[43:35] spirit of God had an Open Door the
[43:37] gospel had an open door and the powers
[43:39] of Satan on the pope to kill the Saints
[43:42] had
[43:43] decreased right so there was an age of
[43:46] great Revelation amen also the first 20
[43:49] years after Pentecost before the
[43:52] Ephesian church the church age started
[43:54] 53 so from 33 to 53 ad was a wonderful
[43:57] time where the church was growing
[43:58] Hallelujah now they had persecution but
[44:01] they overcame all of it by God's
[44:03] grace so you see there there's times
[44:05] when the church grows and uh there's
[44:08] times when the spirit of God is having
[44:09] more preeminence praise
[44:11] God Amen but now today is the day of the
[44:15] greatest deception according to 2
[44:16] Timothy 3:13 and it's also a double evil
[44:19] day like the days of Noah and the days
[44:22] of
[44:24] Sodom right so we can see how most
[44:25] people they all only imagine how to do
[44:28] more evil in their lives rather than
[44:29] good just like the days of Noah right
[44:33] then we also see sodomy many of course
[44:35] increasing in many places so today is
[44:38] not a day where there's a lot of Holy
[44:41] Ghost activity that's not because of God
[44:42] it's because of people grieving the
[44:44] spirit of God can everybody see that by
[44:47] God's
[44:48] grace now I believe now this might
[44:50] strike you a little maybe something new
[44:52] I believe the 20 million demons loose
[44:55] during the six trumpet I don't believe
[44:56] they loose yet I know brother brother
[44:59] talked about it and thought they were
[45:00] but remember the first trumpet burns up
[45:03] a third of the grass and burns a third
[45:05] of the trees the first trumpet yeah
[45:09] right so has that happened yet no has a
[45:12] third of the Earth been burned over with
[45:13] trees no so if the first trumpet hasn't
[45:16] blown the sixth trumpet hasn't blown and
[45:18] remember the first trumpet can't be
[45:20] blown until the 144,000 have been sealed
[45:22] in their
[45:23] foreheads so who's a Bible believer
[45:26] that's my question I say kindly I'm I'm
[45:28] zealous but I say it kindly who's a real
[45:30] Bible believer Hallelujah am right the
[45:33] Bible says you the Bible says the Angels
[45:35] can't hurt the the trees or the grass or
[45:37] anything until the servants have been
[45:39] sealed in their foreheads 144,000
[45:42] hallelujah amen so see I believe these
[45:45] 200 million demons they'll be loose but
[45:47] it's simply more demonic
[45:50] activity and this is true because the
[45:53] Millennium will have much less demonic
[45:55] activity because the Earth will be
[45:57] filled with the knowledge of the Lord
[45:59] like the waters cover the sea hallelujah
[46:02] amen there's still going to be Satan
[46:04] right Satan's going to be bound up
[46:05] though during the
[46:07] Millennium but it's the absence of it's
[46:09] the absence of Satan right where they
[46:12] still have sin in their members amen
[46:14] right they'll still have because they
[46:15] they live through the Armageddon that
[46:17] means those who live through Armageddon
[46:19] still have the bodies like we have but
[46:22] they'll have a perfect environment to
[46:23] live in amen amen oh there be no
[46:26] there'll be no EX TOS from all the
[46:27] planes right people are all concerned
[46:28] about that they say they're concerned
[46:30] about that yet they keep flying on
[46:31] private jets right the people that are
[46:33] concerned about it they keep flying in
[46:34] private jets that's called hypocrisy
[46:36] amen but all that'll be cleaned over all
[46:39] all be cleaned out so people will be
[46:41] able to live for a thousand years if
[46:43] they honor God hallelujah that's right I
[46:47] only say this is now I would say the
[46:49] only possible overlapping now if there
[46:51] is overlapping it would be hell in the
[46:53] heart of the earth that would be the
[46:54] only overlapping that I can see because
[46:57] there is a spiritual realm in the heart
[46:59] of the Earth where souls and Spirits go
[47:02] to when they die right we also know
[47:04] what's where Satan is because Jesus said
[47:06] so shall so so shall the son of man be
[47:08] three days and nights in the heart of
[47:10] the earth
[47:12] amen and then Paul says that Jesus
[47:15] ascended but he also descended into
[47:17] lower parts of the
[47:19] earth so God has a spiritual God has a a
[47:23] Celestial realm inside the heart of the
[47:25] Earth yeah and we also call it the
[47:28] prison house because he went to preach
[47:30] uh to spirits that were in prison
[47:33] everybody with me so far my God's Great
[47:35] I know it's a little bit of her you I
[47:37] love brother said brother said he said
[47:39] you're going to find out one of these
[47:40] days when you go to heaven how looking
[47:41] forward to that you don't fly off to
[47:44] somewhere else you're still right here
[47:46] too just in another dimension faster
[47:49] than this yeah so brother says that
[47:51] Dimension is close so you know if so
[47:55] when I draw that picture of you know the
[47:56] the the terrestrial the celestial it
[47:59] looks like it's far away but somehow
[48:01] it's actually really
[48:03] close because remember even acts 17 said
[48:06] though he be not far from us remember
[48:09] that uh God placed Us in these bounds of
[48:12] our habitation so we would reach to him
[48:14] so we' feel after him so we would reach
[48:16] out in the Holy Spirit Hallelujah
[48:18] because he's really not far from us
[48:20] hallelujah
[48:22] yeah that other dimension is much faster
[48:25] we see it in a couple examples because
[48:27] Micaiah described the Heavenly Council
[48:30] for ahab's Destruction so think about
[48:33] that before God brings his word to pass
[48:36] he has to have a meeting in heaven to
[48:38] figure out how it's going to be
[48:39] accomplished now he knows how it's going
[48:41] to go but he gives the demons and the
[48:43] angels a chance to
[48:46] participate so like our friend ny's had
[48:48] some Court situations right well that's
[48:50] what God has to do in heaven before
[48:52] things happen on Earth
[48:54] yeah and Court takes a long time from
[48:57] what I've heard that's been I went there
[48:58] one time when I was 17 I don't remember
[49:00] it except bad memories I'm only scarred
[49:02] by that uh so I don't remember how long
[49:04] it was because I hit I it rear ended
[49:06] somebody because I wasn't paying
[49:08] attention you know he was crying and it
[49:10] was a very I felt very bad about that
[49:13] but I don't remember how long Court
[49:14] lasted but in heaven we see how it must
[49:18] go faster it's much faster than this
[49:20] realm here because you're not limited by
[49:22] anything amen we're limited here by
[49:24] strength and rest and food and energy
[49:27] and all we're limited by all these
[49:28] things but in that realm they're not
[49:30] limited hallelujah
[49:32] amen and church then this court
[49:35] situation would have to happen for every
[49:37] believer and
[49:39] unbeliever because we saw a court
[49:41] situation for job did we not Glory
[49:43] that's good one I didn't even see that
[49:45] now glory amen there's another Court
[49:47] situation that was just between God and
[49:49] the devil brother called it a testimony
[49:51] service it might have been a testimony
[49:52] service but either way it's a gathering
[49:54] about a Believer where God let Angels
[49:57] and Demons come in and have a discussion
[49:59] about their lives amen hallelujah and
[50:03] God has to do this before the word comes
[50:05] to pass
[50:07] yeah so before God took Bob right before
[50:11] God took mu wife there had to been some
[50:14] discussion about it in heaven there had
[50:17] to been something discussed about it
[50:20] right or before God uh I don't know
[50:24] uh you we can look at different times
[50:26] where Satan anointed people before Satan
[50:28] anointed people did some terrible damage
[50:30] there had to be some type of meeting in
[50:32] heaven where God allowed it amen
[50:34] that's all right so there's a lot of
[50:37] heavenly counsil meetings going on so
[50:39] brother Ram says Heaven's a busy Place
[50:43] amen okay you remember this I saw the
[50:45] Lord sitting on his throne and all the
[50:46] hosts of Heaven standing by him on his
[50:48] right and left and the Lord said who
[50:50] shall persuade Ahab that he may go up
[50:52] and fall at Routh Gilead and one said in
[50:54] this manner another said so at least two
[50:56] angels or two demons get to say well I
[50:58] think this okay now you've had your
[51:00] peace let's let the other one speak okay
[51:02] I think this then God
[51:05] said I'm sorry and then God let a third
[51:07] spear come up and he said I will go
[51:09] forth and persuade him so God lets
[51:11] demons talk at these Heavenly Council
[51:13] meetings and the Lord said wherewith now
[51:16] God knew how it would
[51:18] happen but look how humble he is he lets
[51:21] himself sit on the throne when he's the
[51:22] creator of all this he he limits himself
[51:25] to a throne and then he lets demons have
[51:28] ideas he lets them share their ideas
[51:30] like it's valuable or something it's not
[51:34] right but God just lets it play to his
[51:36] plan hallelujah amen for his
[51:39] glory the lying spirit said I'll go
[51:41] forth and be a lying spirit in the mouth
[51:42] of All His prophets and he said Thou
[51:44] shalt persuade him and Prevail also go
[51:47] forth and do so aren't you glad Mah
[51:49] didn't receive that spirit amen was he
[51:51] tested yes he was tested he was standing
[51:54] right there when 450 were prophesied
[51:57] and see Church aren't you glad you get
[51:59] to have the spirit of truth hallelujah
[52:02] you can stand there a bunch amongst of
[52:04] lying spirits and demonic activity
[52:06] isin't that amazing you can stand right
[52:07] there amongst the lying spirits but
[52:09] you've got the Holy Spirit and the elect
[52:11] cannot be deceived hallelujah oh my
[52:14] glory god acts like he doesn't know the
[52:16] answer but he gives evil spirits
[52:19] permission to do what he already knew
[52:20] they do
[52:23] yeah here's a good one too brother said
[52:25] that dimension faster and this scripture
[52:27] struck me yesterday didn't Jesus say I
[52:30] beheld Satan as Lightning falling from
[52:35] Heaven is lightning fast or slow super
[52:38] fast like once you see it you wish oh I
[52:40] wish I could slow that down and see that
[52:42] again you're looking for the next one to
[52:44] just enjoy that Split Second That
[52:46] twinkly of an
[52:47] eye and so here this proves by the Bible
[52:50] this proves those demons move way faster
[52:53] than we move amen right
[52:56] Hallelujah and now remember Satan is not
[52:59] lightning but he moved as Lightning
[53:02] right so when Michael First cast sat on
[53:04] to Earth it was quick he went right down
[53:06] here to earth like lightning see that's
[53:09] why God brother said God if he wanted to
[53:13] when he saved Shadrach me sh and abedo
[53:15] brother Ram said he stepped down himself
[53:17] and he saved them he said he did a
[53:18] god-sized job in other words God said
[53:21] Angels you're not going I'm going to go
[53:24] and brother said he passed the milky
[53:26] white way and all these things he did it
[53:28] so fast right cuz it's his
[53:30] creation and he he has no limit to how
[53:32] he can move but he tries to give us some
[53:35] way to understand it amen then he says
[53:37] these dimensions are not I'm not far
[53:38] from you all these things oh if he's not
[53:41] far from us that means his love is
[53:42] closer to us as well hallelujah amen his
[53:46] love for us his protection for us it's
[53:48] all in the hands of almighty
[53:50] God
[53:52] Amen just like the Bible say the Holy
[53:54] Ghost descended like a Dove on Jesus the
[53:57] Holy Ghost is not a dove yeah but the
[54:00] Bible tries to give us some figurative
[54:01] language to understand how God moves
[54:04] that's right is that something the Holy
[54:06] Ghost move real slow real
[54:08] tender right and then Satan move like
[54:10] lightning real fast
[54:12] interesting so I believe the changing of
[54:14] Dimensions if you can change Dimensions
[54:17] is just called ascending and
[54:19] descending right because the Lord came
[54:22] down at the Tower of Babel right that
[54:24] word means to descend he descends down
[54:27] yeah so he goes He descends from the
[54:29] suio down to the trust yeah right we
[54:32] already saw it with
[54:34] Lucifer and then uh you know Jacob saw
[54:36] the dream of the the latter angels He
[54:38] was seeing Angels Ascend and descend he
[54:41] was seeing them go up to heaven on this
[54:43] ladder CU God's trying to give them an
[54:46] understanding just try to understand
[54:48] this a little bit amen you're finite
[54:50] you're not infinite right I'm just
[54:52] trying to give you a way to understand
[54:54] it y
[54:56] and then the Bible again says Jesus
[54:58] ascended on high but he also descended
[55:00] to the lower parts of the earth and then
[55:02] we know he filled all heaven so Jesus
[55:04] filled the first Heaven second heaven
[55:06] third heaven he's outside of Heavens
[55:07] amen he's the creator of the heavens
[55:09] hallelujah amen you can't be limited to
[55:12] just one heaven and here's where brother
[55:15] man
[55:17] says you know he he had that dream and
[55:20] like I told you he his soul left his
[55:23] body and he see he saw his body laying
[55:25] there and then he talks to a voice up
[55:26] there he talks to a voice up in the
[55:28] sixth Dimension and he says well if I
[55:31] pass on I want to see Jesus he was all
[55:33] my life I want to see him what is he all
[55:35] your life church amen I hope you and I
[55:37] can say that at the end of our road amen
[55:39] I want to see Jesus he was all my life
[55:41] he's all I live for amen hallelujah and
[55:45] so he said no you can't see him now he's
[55:46] still higher what's the Bible word he
[55:48] uses higher you'd have to ascend to see
[55:51] him amen so there are levels of heaven
[55:55] but it's the same to di menion right
[55:56] it's a it's a spiritual
[55:58] Dimension right but there's levels of
[56:01] heaven and then there's regions down in
[56:04] the lost right we saw that on the Sunday
[56:06] night in Jude chapter 1 where the Bible
[56:08] said the angels that kept not their
[56:09] first to sayate are now chained up in
[56:11] hell so there's a location in hell where
[56:14] angels are chained up then you have
[56:15] Satan had the keys of death and Hell
[56:17] there right and then you had Paradise
[56:19] before where the Lost were and where
[56:21] Abraham's bosom was so you have regions
[56:24] there as well that's scriptural all
[56:26] right now here's something as far as I
[56:29] know John
[56:31] Ezekiel and who's the other one
[56:33] Paul they might have changed dimensions
[56:36] and they might have had out of- body
[56:38] experiences we know brother Ram did he
[56:40] said he went out of his body he saw his
[56:42] body laying there yeah right John he
[56:45] said a door was open in heaven
[56:47] Hallelujah it says come up hither and
[56:50] immediately I was in the spirit
[56:52] Hallelujah so this is either an out of
[56:54] body experience or in the body if it was
[56:57] in the body then it was just kind of
[56:58] like a vision or a dream but he his soul
[57:00] stayed right there in his body yeah but
[57:03] if it was out of body then his body
[57:05] stayed there and his Soul and Spirit
[57:07] left up to heaven and that Soul and
[57:08] Spirit actually went up to
[57:10] heaven changed Dimensions amen all right
[57:15] but I don't know for sure but he said he
[57:16] was caught up in the spirit Ezekiel was
[57:21] surely had an out of- Body Experience
[57:24] now in chapter one he goes in the
[57:26] visions of God the spirit took him up in
[57:28] the vision so he only went there by
[57:30] Vision right so he his body's there and
[57:32] he just has a vision of heaven right the
[57:35] spirit lifted him up and took him me
[57:36] away and went in the bitterness in the
[57:38] heart of my
[57:39] spirit but in chapter 8 he sat in his
[57:41] house and then God comes down and picks
[57:44] him up by the locks of his hair that
[57:47] would be his Spirit body that's right
[57:49] and he carries his body where to
[57:52] Jerusalem so he has an out of- body
[57:55] experience
[57:56] and God can do it like that amen I don't
[57:59] take nothing for God to travel he's
[58:00] outside of time amen amen he moved so
[58:03] fast he don't have to have any
[58:06] time and so this seems like Ezekiel had
[58:09] an out of- Body Experience just like
[58:10] brother Brandon and it seems Paul man
[58:13] because he said I can't tell whether it
[58:14] was out of body or in the body
[58:18] amen so it's likely he had an a body
[58:21] experience but we don't know and this is
[58:24] what brother R said he said he was
[58:25] laying on the the bed and he said I felt
[58:27] myself leaving he felt his soul leaving
[58:30] his body I thought oh oh I've already
[58:32] died I I and I got to a place I said I
[58:35] believe I'll look back so he moved his
[58:37] soul moved and he said I want look back
[58:38] at my
[58:40] body and there I was lying on the bed I
[58:42] was stretched out laying by the side of
[58:45] my wife I thought well it was probably a
[58:47] heart attack he said that's I died
[58:49] instantly he said which would be a fine
[58:51] way of
[58:52] going is that a fine way to die for
[58:54] everybody here
[58:57] well see I just died instantly that
[58:58] would have been a fine way to go that's
[58:59] just a heart attack I didn't have to
[59:01] suffer I thought well now that's strange
[59:03] there I lay right there and here I stand
[59:05] here so he was standing on a spiritual
[59:07] plane amen he was standing on a
[59:09] Celestial plane amen looking down at his
[59:13] body all right now I'm going to go
[59:15] through this quickly I'm almost ready to
[59:16] close here uh how how long have I been
[59:19] let me
[59:19] see oh just I'm at 59 minutes okay well
[59:26] now most you know this but let me just
[59:27] go over these briefly remember there's
[59:28] two kinds of bodies there's Celestial
[59:30] terrestrial angels have the celestial
[59:33] bodies Angels the Bible said are
[59:35] ministering Spirits yeah which is the
[59:38] Numa in the Greek so they have to have
[59:40] if they're Spirits they have to have a
[59:42] spiritual body or a Celestial body
[59:44] remember Jesus said we'll be as the
[59:46] Angels over there we'll be as in other
[59:48] words in the mnium we'll have Angelic
[59:49] bodies right Hallelujah where we don't
[59:52] marry anymore there'll be no natural
[59:53] marriage anymore okay
[59:56] now here's where the Angels wrestle
[59:58] right the prince of of the kingdom of
[59:59] Persia wh stood me 21 days but Lo
[1:00:02] Michael came to help me now with stood
[1:00:05] means to stand your ground so this Angel
[1:00:07] was trying to get down to Daniel but
[1:00:09] this Prince of Persia is standing his
[1:00:10] ground and withstanding him keeping him
[1:00:12] out they're probably wrestling because
[1:00:14] when the when Jacob wrestled he wrestled
[1:00:16] with an angel Hallelujah and we wrestle
[1:00:19] not against spiritual principalities
[1:00:21] against Powers I'm sorry wrestle against
[1:00:23] not flesh and blood but spiritual
[1:00:25] wickedness in high plac amen so the
[1:00:27] Prince of Persia is keeping by this
[1:00:28] Angel for 21 days now it wasn't that
[1:00:30] long for them because they go much
[1:00:32] faster okay but he kept and finally
[1:00:35] Michael come through and said oh you
[1:00:36] come here Prince of Persia let me
[1:00:38] wrestle with you a little bit here let
[1:00:39] me and so then the angel could come down
[1:00:41] there and say Daniel Heaven loves you
[1:00:44] amen hallelujah church when your prayers
[1:00:46] are answered it reminds you Heaven loves
[1:00:48] you Hallelujah Heaven hears your prayers
[1:00:50] amen amen and some Angel come in and sit
[1:00:52] in the way brother Austin that God can
[1:00:54] answer your prayer amen amen right some
[1:00:57] Angel stood in the Gap so that the
[1:00:59] answer could come down and and we could
[1:01:01] get our prayers answered from Heaven
[1:01:02] hallelujah praise God cuz we're we're
[1:01:05] Heaven's beloved Hallelujah am amen and
[1:01:09] then he says Daniel I got to go I got to
[1:01:10] go back and keep fighting aren't you
[1:01:12] glad angels are fighting for you
[1:01:13] hallelujah amen they're fighting for you
[1:01:15] they're trying to get
[1:01:16] through and it's all in God's time and
[1:01:19] season
[1:01:20] Hallelujah remember there was a war in
[1:01:22] heaven Michael fought against his a I'm
[1:01:24] sorry Michael and his angels fought
[1:01:25] against against the dragon and his
[1:01:27] angels then he was cast into the Earth
[1:01:30] cast like lightning right down here just
[1:01:32] crossing Dimensions cross in the the
[1:01:34] terrestial Galaxy right right through
[1:01:37] that and then Satan lands right there on
[1:01:39] the
[1:01:40] earth see so they can rest so they can
[1:01:42] have wars in the spiritual
[1:01:46] bodies right and remember Angels now
[1:01:49] this is a little deeper but angels can
[1:01:51] actually put on a flesh body
[1:01:54] yeah right which that's no different
[1:01:56] than like ours right I me except that
[1:01:59] that's theophany but ours is a spiritual
[1:02:01] Soul and Spirit yeah right it's pretty
[1:02:04] much the same as us angels can just put
[1:02:06] on a flesh body and when when Abraham
[1:02:09] visited God three he come down like him
[1:02:11] and two angels they come down and look
[1:02:13] like real men and they ate meat and they
[1:02:15] drank milk Hallelujah Angels amen they
[1:02:20] just borrow those bodies for a few
[1:02:21] moments then brother said then God took
[1:02:23] all the poish calcium and all thees
[1:02:26] components and then just went threw them
[1:02:27] right back to the Earth he sucked them
[1:02:28] up to put the bodies on the angels and
[1:02:30] then threw it back on the earth H just
[1:02:32] borrowed it for a few minutes amen God
[1:02:34] so see we got to keep that in mind as
[1:02:35] well
[1:02:37] Hallelujah now you remember this this
[1:02:39] this may may be a little striking here
[1:02:41] but dead Spirits or Souls that are not
[1:02:45] saved are naked they don't have a white
[1:02:47] robe the Bible says that yeah that might
[1:02:50] be hard for us to understand but down
[1:02:51] there in the heart of the earth if
[1:02:53] they're not saved they're naked spirits
[1:02:54] and souls they got a spirit ual body but
[1:02:57] they're naked they don't have on the
[1:02:58] white robe right cuz the Bible said if
[1:03:00] our Earthly house that this Tabernacle
[1:03:02] were dissolved we have a building of God
[1:03:04] a house not made with hands Eternal in
[1:03:06] the heavens for in this we grown how
[1:03:08] many groaning for a new body amen how
[1:03:10] how many really grown oh one day I'll be
[1:03:12] perfect one day I'll finally be like
[1:03:14] Jesus Hallelujah no more mistakes no
[1:03:16] more frustrations or failures or fluster
[1:03:19] as brother says no more of that but I'll
[1:03:21] be perfect just like my heavenly father
[1:03:24] Hallelujah I'm Desiring to be clothed
[1:03:27] with that if so be that being clothed we
[1:03:29] shall not be found what naked yeah
[1:03:32] that's a a Soul and Spirit without a
[1:03:34] theophany body without a white robe
[1:03:38] on okay not that we would be unclothed
[1:03:42] see we're not going to be just a spirit
[1:03:44] and soul we're going to be clothed upon
[1:03:47] that mortality might be swallowed up in
[1:03:50] life amen there's more than one verse on
[1:03:52] this that remember Revelation Jesus says
[1:03:54] this he said people today are miserable
[1:03:56] poor blind and naked not just stripped
[1:03:58] down like women naked but their souls
[1:04:00] are naked right they don't have a
[1:04:03] theophany waiting for them yeah but what
[1:04:06] do you got the opposite of naked is you
[1:04:08] got a white rayment hallelujah amen amen
[1:04:12] you got a white rment and you're clothed
[1:04:14] in the sight of God hallelujah amen in
[1:04:16] other words Jesus shared his
[1:04:18] righteousness with you and you have the
[1:04:20] righteousness of Christ hallelujah amen
[1:04:22] a righteousness that is not your own
[1:04:25] amen
[1:04:27] amen so that's that theophany that white
[1:04:29] rment a sinner doesn't have the white
[1:04:32] rment the
[1:04:33] theophany and I'll close with this now I
[1:04:36] am going to do a part three at some
[1:04:38] point I got all these notes down here I
[1:04:40] don't know if you can see them down here
[1:04:41] all these red notes these are all things
[1:04:43] I want to address and preach and kind of
[1:04:44] I want to place them inside
[1:04:47] of uh the framework that I've that I
[1:04:50] understand right now because it's
[1:04:51] already been an hour we got a second
[1:04:53] service and we also have a baptism I
[1:04:55] want to be mind of that so I just want
[1:04:56] to close with this here by God's grace
[1:04:58] remember friends that our prayers enter
[1:05:00] into if you want to call it the seventh
[1:05:01] Dimension go ahead call it we call
[1:05:03] whatever you
[1:05:04] want call the third heaven call everyone
[1:05:06] but just remember that your prayers God
[1:05:08] sees your prayers in heaven today amen
[1:05:12] amen our prayers go so much higher than
[1:05:15] what we think Hallelujah I'm glad God
[1:05:18] reminds us every now and then when he
[1:05:19] answers one of our prayers like wow that
[1:05:20] was Supernatural God reminds us that
[1:05:22] your prayers are effective remember the
[1:05:25] Bible said the effectual fervent prayer

[1:05:56] anchor for the soul both sure and
[1:05:59] steadfast which entereth into that
[1:06:02] within the
[1:06:04] veil so let me just go back up to that
[1:06:06] picture your hope is right there in
[1:06:10] heaven right there I'm going to copy
[1:06:12] that and paste it down
[1:06:14] here your hope enters right
[1:06:20] there your hope enters with everybody
[1:06:23] say within the veil ready within the
[1:06:25] Veil

[1:06:42] high as it can go it goes the highest
[1:06:44] that it can possibly go amen your
[1:06:46] prayers that's what the Bible says your
[1:06:49] hope goes all the way up there to God's
[1:06:52] Throne yeah so if God hasn't answered
[1:06:54] what does he do he's de veloping
[1:06:56] patience in your life yeah he's
[1:06:58] developing comfort in your life trust in
[1:07:00] your life amen amen hallelujah because

[1:07:05] don't sin as long as we yeah that's as
[1:07:07] long as we don't ask according to the
[1:07:09] lust of our flesh then the Bible said
[1:07:10] God will hear our prayers amen and if we
[1:07:13] don't ask in our selfishness then the
[1:07:15] prayers go up there and then God is just
[1:07:16] waiting for the right time he's having
[1:07:18] Council meetings amen waitting for the
[1:07:21] right counsel meeting to send the right
[1:07:22] blessing at the right time

[1:07:29] trials that we can be tested the trials
[1:07:31] are more precious than
[1:07:34] gold God knows after we get through this
[1:07:36] trial we'll have much more faith we'll
[1:07:38] be stronger we'll be able to withstand
[1:07:40] more the next time amen and we can
[1:07:42] manifest the presence and the character
[1:07:45] of Jesus Christ amen amen amen amen so

[1:09:25] he said I didn't take it because I
[1:09:27] desired a gift but I desired fruit that
[1:09:29] you may abound that may abound to your
[1:09:32] account what account is he talking about
[1:09:34] their Heavenly bank account
[1:09:36] amen the Heavenly memorials up in heaven

[1:09:58] nothing else to give you I just want to
[1:10:00] give this to you just for being a
[1:10:01] blessing he said to think that God would
[1:10:03] give me a friend like you I said brother

[1:10:07] like you amen who would drive on a

[1:10:11] retired now don't feel bad you he's
[1:10:13] retired he can drive anywhere he wants
[1:10:15] but he would come I think you know if
[1:10:17] this is all that he can afford to give
[1:10:20] how many believe there will be a
[1:10:20] blessing for that in
[1:10:22] heaven now I left that pen in my office
[1:10:26] so that I can use it more often by God's
[1:10:28] grace I didn't put it I should have put
[1:10:30] in my pocket but that's just an example
[1:10:32] of somebody they just want to give they
[1:10:33] just want to uh be a blessing to you so
[1:10:36] friends if if somebody wants to be a
[1:10:38] blessing to you just let them do it you
[1:10:39] know do it not selfishly take it but
[1:10:42] just say God bless you for that I mean I
[1:10:44] even need this but I can bless somebody
[1:10:46] else with it but receive it so that way
[1:10:48] that person can have a reward in heaven
[1:10:51] am
[1:10:52] amen and then we saw this the angel came
[1:10:55] down to cornos and looked on him and
[1:10:57] said your prayers and thine arms are
[1:11:00] come up for a memorial not under God
[1:11:03] church not under but before God so
[1:11:06] there's some place in the presence of
[1:11:08] God where there's there's vials too
[1:11:10] remember there's vials of prayers
[1:11:11] there's somewhere some vials around here
[1:11:14] where your prayers come up and they're
[1:11:15] stored in those
[1:11:17] vials all because of the holy spirit
[1:11:19] inside of you that wants to see God move
[1:11:22] in your life wants to see God move who
[1:11:24] is El was probably praying for his
[1:11:26] family right to be filled with the Holy
[1:11:27] Ghost he was probably praying to be
[1:11:28] filled with the Holy Ghost but the angel
[1:11:30] said all those prayers all the arms you
[1:11:32] gave to the poor people all the fasting
[1:11:35] you did all the prayers when you fasted
[1:11:37] all that has been stored up in heaven
[1:11:39] and God has seen it and God will
[1:11:42] remember it and it's not that God
[1:11:44] forgets it just lets us know that at the
[1:11:46] right time God will bless you for those
[1:11:49] sacrifices you make let's stand our Fe
[1:11:51] feet and just can
