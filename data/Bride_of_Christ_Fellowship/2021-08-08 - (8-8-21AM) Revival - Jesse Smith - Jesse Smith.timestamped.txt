[0:00] thank the lord for his grace and mercy
[0:09] i actually didn't choose a text for this
[0:11] message let me choose it here
[0:14] let's go to hosea chapter six yes
[0:16] because i have some good quotes on that
[0:17] from brother branham as well
[0:20] hosea chapter six
[0:22] verse one
[0:24] like last sunday i'm going to take a
[0:26] little break from the joshua series in
[0:28] the morning and i'm gonna preach on uh
[0:30] revival
[0:32] this morning revival last sunday i
[0:34] looked at lukewarm never applies to your
[0:37] soul
[0:38] it never does it's impossible
[0:40] thank you
[0:42] it's impossible to be lukewarm when
[0:44] you're baptized with the fire of the
[0:46] holy ghost amen your soul can never be
[0:49] lukewarm your mind can your flesh hates
[0:52] the spirit of god most of the time
[0:53] unless it's fully anointed right
[0:55] uh has an anointing on it by the holy
[0:57] spirit but your your mind is lukewarm
[1:00] often your souls never luke warm if
[1:02] you're born again
[1:04] and today we're going to see similar
[1:06] thoughts about revival
[1:09] you are revived once in your soul
[1:12] but your mind needs revived constantly
[1:16] so when you say i need a revival well
[1:18] you're they're saying i need born again
[1:19] for the first time or my mind needs made
[1:22] alive again i need to put new thoughts
[1:24] in my mind amen
[1:27] that's why we don't go from i'm saved to
[1:29] this revival i'm not saved at the next
[1:30] one you know we don't go like that like
[1:32] brother man talked about that he laughed
[1:33] about people like that
[1:35] that's not how we live our lives we're
[1:37] revived once we're born again we're
[1:39] baptized by the holy ghost one time one
[1:41] revival in the soul and the rest of our
[1:43] days we keep our mind revived by the
[1:46] renewing of the holy ghost
[1:48] the thoughts of god praise god hosea
[1:50] chapter 6 verse 1.
[1:55] now this is prophetic church this is
[1:56] prophetic i believe this is not mistaken
[1:58] this is about 800 years before christ
[2:01] this is prophetic to israel receiving
[2:03] the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:05] praise god on the third day
[2:08] so it's prophetic of the day of
[2:11] pentecost but it's also prophetic of the
[2:12] hundred forty four thousand
[2:14] you'll see why
[2:15] chapter six verse one come let us return
[2:17] unto the lord for hath torn and he will
[2:20] heal us
[2:21] he has smitten and he will bind us up
[2:23] this is a people that is they were
[2:25] backslidden they were kicked out of the
[2:27] land
[2:28] right but they're allowed to come back
[2:31] right
[2:32] verse two after two days he will revive
[2:35] us jesus raised on the third day
[2:38] praise god and then once he raised they
[2:40] could be born again
[2:42] in the third day he will raise us up and
[2:44] we will live in a sight now this also
[2:46] means a day can be a thousand years
[2:49] right so after the 2000 year gentile age
[2:52] on the third day in the third thousand
[2:54] after that israel can be revived
[2:57] brother man you says that in the feast
[2:58] of the trumpets 64.
[3:01] verse 3 then shall we know if we follow
[3:04] on to know the lord his going forth is
[3:06] prepared as the morning and he shall
[3:08] come unto us as the rain as the latter
[3:11] and former rain
[3:13] unto the earth
[3:15] the baptism of holy ghost what is the
[3:16] latter rain it's just a renewing of the
[3:18] baptism of the holy ghost
[3:20] praise god
[3:21] now this church this could have happened
[3:22] to
[3:23] where israel could have got a revival in
[3:26] their minds but remember in the old
[3:27] testament they could not be born again
[3:29] in the soul
[3:30] because the blood of jesus had not been
[3:31] shed
[3:32] right so they they could have had a
[3:34] third they could have a third day
[3:35] revival in the days of hosea but it only
[3:38] would have been in the mind it would not
[3:39] have been in the soul
[3:41] because the blood of jesus had not
[3:42] washed away sin let's have a word of
[3:44] prayer let's just bow our heads and you
[3:45] have a need on your heart let's just
[3:46] make it known unto the lord god is in
[3:48] control of all things he knows all
[3:50] things he's he's here to bless us he's
[3:52] here to help us and we're here to
[3:53] receive from him we're here to bless him
[3:55] and worship him so let's bow our heads
[3:57] here heavenly father we read your word
[3:58] we thank you for this holy word and god
[4:00] we ask god that your holy spirit will
[4:02] now get into the word lord break down
[4:04] any understanding we might
[4:05] misunderstanding we might have had and
[4:07] lord build us up in the correct
[4:09] understanding encourage your people
[4:10] strengthen your people lord god the
[4:12] revelation of the hour keeps growing it
[4:14] keeps unfolding we thank you that it
[4:16] brings us stability confirmation it
[4:19] establishes our hearts in the faith as
[4:21] we look to your soon coming dear jesus
[4:23] prepare us oh god for thy coming and god
[4:25] we know we'll be ready by the revival of
[4:27] the holy ghost in our soul and god help
[4:29] us to revive our hearts today our minds
[4:31] rather today in jesus christ's name and
[4:33] the saint said
[4:35] amen god bless you as you're being
[4:36] seated praise god
[4:41] so i have quite a few uh
[4:43] slides and quotes and scriptures to
[4:45] share so i think i preached an hour and
[4:47] a half last sunday uh
[4:49] i may i may match that today so i'm just
[4:51] giving you a little warning i may i
[4:52] could match that today it's possible
[4:55] it's possible i couldn't do that by the
[4:56] grace of the lord
[4:58] and i know you're just a great
[4:59] loving people and
[5:01] i just want to preach on revival just
[5:03] plain and simple revival because it's a
[5:06] greatly misunderstood thing and i think
[5:08] the main misunderstanding church is
[5:10] people have about one quote where
[5:12] brother random says in the third seal
[5:14] the bride hasn't had a revival
[5:17] but you've got to look at the context of
[5:19] that quote and then look at all the
[5:20] quotes afterwards
[5:22] we're in revival right now church
[5:24] i don't know if you're born again you're
[5:26] you're in revival right now
[5:28] because it's in your soul and that quote
[5:30] in particular we'll get to that brother
[5:31] bran was talking about of course the
[5:32] latter rain right that last rapture that
[5:35] last anointing before the rapture if you
[5:37] look at the quote
[5:38] so we'll look at that today we'll get to
[5:39] it eventually by the grace of the lord
[5:41] but i want to start just with the
[5:42] foundational thoughts
[5:44] uh if you miss wednesday
[5:46] yeah everybody miss wednesday i show
[5:49] after i turn off the live stream
[5:51] i showed some videos
[5:53] just to kind of update you on things you
[5:55] know two weeks ago there was that
[5:56] hearing in the capital about the january
[5:58] 6 insurrection and they purposely
[6:01] targeted christians in that whole thing
[6:03] i don't know if you saw it one of the
[6:04] cops specifically said all these
[6:06] terrorists were christians they had
[6:07] signs that said jesus is king trump is
[6:09] our president jesus is the lord of lords
[6:12] king of kings
[6:13] church it's coming down to this spot
[6:15] where revelation 13 says there without
[6:18] the mark you cannot buy or sell right we
[6:21] see canceled culture canceling
[6:22] conservatives this is just the beginning
[6:25] we see the vaccine coming on right uh it
[6:28] looks like it might be mandatory it's
[6:29] all a pre-figure of this one world
[6:32] church system that's coming i'm glad i'm
[6:34] in the true church of christ though i
[6:36] have no more churches to join i'm not
[6:38] going to join theirs i've already joined
[6:40] the body of jesus christ by the baptism
[6:42] of the holy ghost amen we have no
[6:44] attraction to the things of the world we
[6:46] have no attraction to political powers
[6:47] and all the wickedness that uh that that
[6:50] is uh in that movement remember they're
[6:52] having revival but it's the wrong spirit
[6:55] they're having an antichrist spirit
[6:56] revival we're having the bride's revival
[6:59] amen praise god well let me get started
[7:02] here by the grace of the lord amen
[7:04] uh
[7:05] so we like to look here and uh and look
[7:07] at revival
[7:10] uh now the purpose church is to show how
[7:12] the lukewarm
[7:14] just like last week's sermon the
[7:16] born-again soul never needs revival
[7:19] because the soul
[7:21] can never be dead or lukewarm
[7:24] how can your if you have eternal life in
[7:26] your soul how can that life be dead it
[7:30] can't die it's eternal
[7:31] praise god
[7:33] right the quicken soul is eternally hot
[7:36] it can not sin
[7:38] first john 3 9 says the seed that's in
[7:40] you cannot sin
[7:43] it is impossible
[7:45] for the soul of a holy ghost-filled
[7:47] christian to ever disbelieve again
[7:50] because it's god's life in his soul
[7:52] now the human mind or spirit is where
[7:54] the daily revival takes place
[7:58] or i'll say it like this if let me say
[8:00] like this if you get a complex you'll
[8:02] skip your daily revival and you might
[8:03] have to get revived next week
[8:06] right because holy ghost field
[8:07] christians can have awful mind battles
[8:10] and complexes even brother branham had
[8:13] them
[8:14] right we get kind of quiet on that but
[8:15] that's the truth
[8:17] there's there's times even if we're born
[8:18] again we choose not to get revive that
[8:20] service
[8:22] and we keep in our depressed state or we
[8:24] keep in our angry state we keep in our
[8:27] bitter state
[8:28] we keep in our lying state
[8:30] brother ram lied to the irs i made it
[8:32] right right away but that proves
[8:34] somebody could lie but then not make it
[8:35] right right away and still have the holy
[8:37] ghost
[8:38] right
[8:39] so uh these are uh important things to
[8:42] keep in mind
[8:43] but ultimately if you are born again you
[8:46] you you you've already you uh you've
[8:48] already surrendered all responsibility
[8:50] of your soul to jesus so jesus is
[8:52] obligated because you've surrendered and
[8:54] you've identified yourself with his name
[8:56] and water baptism he's obligated to come
[8:58] around and correct you and help you come
[9:01] back to repentance and get you in the
[9:03] place where you need to be because he
[9:05] said i'll guide you into all truth
[9:08] now someone that's not born again will
[9:10] not be brought back to the truth
[9:12] right they can still be saved foolish
[9:14] virgin or they could lose their
[9:16] salvation like judah's name was blotted
[9:18] out jesus said if you don't repent i'll
[9:20] blot your name out of the book of life
[9:22] so see it all goes back to those four
[9:24] kinds of grounds jesus taught about
[9:26] praise god we looked at that recently i
[9:28] think it was last sunday night we looked
[9:29] at that yes
[9:30] again we reviewed it now so see soul
[9:32] revival happens once ephesians 2 verses
[9:36] 1 5 and 8 say you're you were dead and
[9:39] sins but now you're quickened or made
[9:41] alive
[9:43] hallelujah james 5 20 says when you
[9:45] convert a sinner's soul he you save his
[9:48] soul from death meaning his soul is
[9:51] alive
[9:52] hallelujah
[9:54] brother branham taught the revival of
[9:56] hosea 6 2 which we read for our text
[9:59] was the 144 000 israelis receiving
[10:02] pentecost so this means we receive that
[10:05] revival when we are born again
[10:09] now the revival is renewing our minds
[10:11] let's take your bibles if you would
[10:13] please let's go to ephesians 4. i don't
[10:15] you know i don't i don't make you hold
[10:16] your bible all service but uh you know
[10:18] from time to time i'll see people hold
[10:20] their bibles and they'll set it down
[10:21] then they know i'm just going to preach
[10:22] you know but let's pick up your bibles
[10:24] here for a moment ephesians 4 22 now
[10:27] this text
[10:28] speaks when you and i feed the the black
[10:31] dog or think about the black sins right
[10:34] or the black thoughts and says the right
[10:35] thoughts when we feed the black dog we
[10:38] actually put off the anointing we lose
[10:39] the anointing of the holy ghost in our
[10:41] minds
[10:43] and we put what's caught on the old man
[10:45] the bible says
[10:47] right we start thinking with the old
[10:48] thoughts and right you can remember i
[10:50] used to do that in high school or oh i
[10:52] used to do that after when i was a child
[10:53] or and they were maybe evil thoughts
[10:55] right evil deeds
[10:57] you can actually put off the new man in
[10:59] your thoughts the new thinking and put
[11:01] back on your old man
[11:03] right ephesians 4 22.
[11:07] so let's just look at this here and keep
[11:09] in mind how brother ram lied to the irs
[11:11] because he's he's our clear example we
[11:13] can see his life we truly know he was
[11:15] born again right if anyone was born
[11:17] again it was him praise god because he
[11:19] walked so closely to christ and
[11:20] marvelous gifts was so dedicated to
[11:23] jesus christ right we're all uh we're
[11:25] all aspiring to live that kind of a
[11:27] burning life for christ
[11:29] because he was one of the seven stars in
[11:31] the hand of jesus christ amen his life
[11:34] was burning with the shining light of
[11:36] the example of how to be a christian
[11:38] praise god amen
[11:40] verse 22 that you put off concerning the
[11:43] former conversation the old man which is
[11:46] corrupt according to deceitful lust and
[11:48] be renewed in the spirit of your mind
[11:53] and that ye put on the new man which
[11:55] after god is created in righteousness
[11:57] and true holiness so see brother man
[11:59] when he lied to the eye house he said i
[12:01] was so nervous and he said my head was
[12:02] in a spin
[12:04] in other words he didn't renew his mind
[12:06] that moment
[12:08] and he he and he got the phone call he
[12:10] said mida tell him i'm not here and he
[12:12] slipped out but he was there
[12:15] and he lied to the irs they tried to
[12:17] pray for the baby and the holy spirit
[12:19] said you're going to put your lying
[12:20] hands on the baby and you had to go make
[12:22] it right confess to the irs that he lied
[12:24] to the irs so see how he he took off the
[12:26] new man and just got busy i'm sorry just
[12:29] got overwhelmed right we all get over
[12:30] 100 men overwhelmed the last week or two
[12:33] anybody lost your cool
[12:35] anybody lost lost your kindness no
[12:37] longer you're not kind for a few moments
[12:40] get angry you know upset worry fear i
[12:43] battle fear are they gonna make me get
[12:44] the vaccine i battled that right but
[12:46] i've had to overcome that praise i got
[12:47] to put on the new man amen
[12:49] right
[12:51] and so brother man uh was his head was
[12:53] spinning with nervousness how have i had
[12:55] meeting after meeting when is this ever
[12:56] going to end it's been years and years
[12:58] and years i don't see the ending of this
[12:59] so just tell them i'm not here
[13:02] but see he didn't act righteously but
[13:04] the bible said in verse 24 when you have
[13:06] the new man on you are righteous and you
[13:08] live in true holiness
[13:10] and so he repented of that right the
[13:12] holy spirit brought him back into
[13:14] righteousness and true holiness praise
[13:16] god
[13:18] verse 25 wherefore put away lying didn't
[13:20] brother ram lie what do you have to do
[13:21] you had to put away lying paul's writing
[13:23] this to holy ghost-filled saints that
[13:25] know how to operate their gifts this is
[13:27] the ephesian church this is the mature
[13:29] church amen this should be us hallelujah
[13:31] amen
[13:33] right we know how the gifts operate we
[13:34] know how to bring every gift into
[13:35] subjection the word of god we're not out
[13:37] there we're not sleeping with with
[13:39] family members and committing adultery
[13:41] and fornication that's the corinthian
[13:42] church right too much on emotion uh we
[13:45] still have spiritual things not truly uh
[13:47] filled with the holy ghost right but
[13:48] this is the mature church and paul tells
[13:50] the mature church you've got to put off
[13:53] lying you've got to put off stealing see
[13:55] these minor little things see god will
[13:58] forgive us of those we've got to put
[13:59] them off and put on the new man
[14:03] glory
[14:05] put away lying right like a prophet
[14:07] would
[14:08] how do you do that go confess
[14:10] i'm sorry i didn't tell you the truth
[14:11] and people think better of you if you do
[14:13] that
[14:16] speak every truth with his neighbor for
[14:18] we are members of one another be angry
[14:20] i'm angry this week i've been angry
[14:23] you can be angry though and not sin
[14:26] let not the sun go down upon your wrath
[14:28] neither give place to the devil so see
[14:30] when brother adam was sitting there he
[14:32] gave a place in his mind to the enemy
[14:34] worry frustration right head spinning
[14:37] busyness uh cares of the world whatever
[14:40] you would say
[14:41] he gave a place but thank god the holy
[14:44] ghost took that place back amen
[14:47] he didn't he didn't the holy spirit
[14:48] didn't do it without his freemore agency
[14:50] brother brahma had to give his free
[14:51] moral agency over and accept the
[14:54] correction and make it right so see
[14:55] god's not going to force us to do it but
[14:58] he'll lead us to do it
[15:00] right denominations force right
[15:03] satan brother says satan is the god of
[15:05] force god doesn't force us but he heals
[15:07] us by his goodness he leads us to
[15:10] repentance amen
[15:12] he shows us his goodness and it helps us
[15:14] make the right decision and get our
[15:16] lives back with the new man the holy
[15:18] ghost man amen
[15:20] brought that up there that you can see
[15:21] that i don't have to reference that i
[15:22] just already preached it now this is i
[15:24] preached this a couple years ago after i
[15:25] listened to the message thirst from 1965
[15:28] brother graham said in your soul you
[15:29] have free more agency your will or your
[15:31] desire you either choose faith or
[15:32] unbelief but the soul needs filled now
[15:35] these are all the same thing filled is
[15:37] the same as sealed it just has different
[15:39] applications clothe your soul needs
[15:41] clothes your soul needs circumcised all
[15:43] these bible terms
[15:45] your soul needs born again and now
[15:47] church we know your soul needs revived
[15:49] one time because the word quicken is
[15:52] basically the same as revived
[15:54] it needs made alive
[15:57] because you were your soul was dead in
[15:59] unbelief but now your soul has anointed
[16:02] with faith now your soul is anointed
[16:04] with the holy spirit
[16:07] praise god
[16:09] now show this i remember naomi like this
[16:10] one i showed this thing remember that
[16:11] when sister know me a while back we
[16:12] talked about that
[16:13] this kind of helps us see we don't get
[16:15] complexes in our souls we get complexes
[16:18] in our minds
[16:20] satan will build up a complex and that
[16:22] and we give a place to the devil
[16:24] right and so let's say i got a i got
[16:26] something against brother amen every
[16:27] time i think of amen oh i'm going to get
[16:29] i can't wait to get back when i'm going
[16:31] to get revenge on him i've allowed satan
[16:33] to get into my mind and build up a
[16:36] complex that attacks brother amen
[16:39] but the bible said we have the power and
[16:41] the weapons of warfare to cast down any
[16:44] stronghold any castle praise god
[16:47] anything that exalts itself the word of
[16:49] god we are we are mighty uh to cast
[16:51] these down and to clear the land of all
[16:54] complexes amen
[16:56] we're able to revive the mind revive the
[16:59] land praise god
[17:01] hallelujah thank god amen this is uh
[17:04] where the complexes take place in the
[17:06] mind
[17:09] but also the soul has one revival but in
[17:12] other words if you have complexes your
[17:14] mind needs revived your mind needs
[17:16] constant revivals
[17:21] so the main issue here will be going
[17:23] through the bible i'll go through the
[17:24] bible scriptures on revival and then go
[17:26] through some quotes and like i said the
[17:28] bride's revival quote is the most one
[17:30] people stumble at and if church if they
[17:32] take that wrong then they get all
[17:34] depressed and defeated like i haven't
[17:36] had revival church i know i've had
[17:38] revival
[17:39] i know what it was like to be a sinner
[17:41] and i thank god i know it's like to be a
[17:43] saint amen
[17:45] i am separated from the things of the
[17:47] world the things that i used to do i do
[17:49] them no more praise god
[17:53] christ has risen in me the day stars
[17:55] rise in my heart amen
[17:58] it was death in my soul it was dark in
[18:00] my soul but now i've got life in my soul
[18:04] amen nobody can tell me i'm not in the
[18:05] bride's revival because i know i was
[18:07] dead in sin and i know i'm quick now
[18:10] amen
[18:12] see i don't want our church to be
[18:14] defeated like that now if you've got a
[18:15] complex
[18:16] yes then you need revival
[18:19] let's clear that out let's let's take
[18:20] the word of god and let let's cast down
[18:22] those stones amen we can do it real
[18:25] quick it takes about five minutes maybe
[18:27] less you know you confess your sins and
[18:29] and go make it right you can cast that
[18:31] down in no time
[18:34] hallelujah
[18:36] but we don't want to be defeated message
[18:38] believers we don't want to be defeated
[18:40] holy ghost-filled saints we don't want
[18:42] to be complex filled saints we want to
[18:45] be revived saints
[18:49] so this was i was surprised this is a
[18:51] very simple bible study if you look up
[18:53] revive in the bible it's very simple
[18:55] there's only 26 hits now
[18:58] only 15 are in the bible these 11 are in
[19:01] the lexicons
[19:02] which they just give you know
[19:03] definitions of words
[19:05] right
[19:06] so this morning as as this thought came
[19:09] to me i only had to search about 15
[19:11] scriptures it's a pretty short study
[19:12] it was kind of nice then i could spend
[19:14] more time on brother bran's quotes
[19:16] so it actually worked out really good by
[19:17] god's grace now see church our focus i
[19:20] said in the note will be the new
[19:22] testament application because the new
[19:24] birth is now available
[19:27] it was not available the soul jesus said
[19:29] i come to give your soul rest hebrews 4
[19:32] said if joshua
[19:34] actually gave them rest then why did the
[19:36] bible speak of another day to give them
[19:38] rest
[19:39] right he gave them rest from physical
[19:41] enemies but jesus come to give us rest
[19:43] in our souls amen
[19:46] so the nature doesn't wrestle against
[19:48] god and trying to be saved and worrying
[19:49] about the souls that and that say the
[19:51] soul is sealed the soul has a foundation
[19:54] the soul has the souls marked amen
[19:57] the soul has the presence of god
[20:04] now both of the definitions are the same
[20:08] hebrew old testament and new testament
[20:10] they're both the same they both speak of
[20:14] physics like someone who's
[20:17] dead that comes back to life that's
[20:18] called a revival so jesus had constant
[20:20] revivals lazarus had a revival
[20:22] physically he died four days later he
[20:24] had a revival
[20:26] so so revival can mean your physical
[20:28] body but also
[20:30] uh your human spirit as well
[20:34] okay so we'll see it you'll see it this
[20:35] is old testament new testament so and
[20:37] the bible said jesus revived on the
[20:39] third day
[20:41] okay so revive means both to the body
[20:44] soul and spirit
[20:46] oh thank god amen and now in the new
[20:48] testament one who returns to a better
[20:51] moral state that's the one that we need
[20:53] we need constant revivals up here in our
[20:55] minds amen to stop worrying about the
[20:57] cares of the world stop worrying i'm
[20:59] trying to figure things out that haven't
[21:00] even happened yet trying to cross
[21:02] bridges before they get there let's just
[21:04] stand where we are praise god let's
[21:06] stand on the land that god has given us
[21:08] let's possess the land amen
[21:10] let's stand on the land that god has
[21:12] given us and not be a slave and not let
[21:14] castles be built up in our minds where
[21:16] we attack others but let's be clear from
[21:18] those so we can save others
[21:22] glory
[21:27] now in the old testament
[21:29] 13 scriptures so revive meant physically
[21:32] dead coming back to life depressed mind
[21:34] being healed
[21:36] so they could have revivals in the old
[21:37] testament in their minds
[21:39] more spiritual strength and one time it
[21:41] foretold the 144 thousand receiving the
[21:43] holy ghost so
[21:44] now remember saints the old testament
[21:46] saints could never receive the baptism
[21:48] holy ghost this means the only revival
[21:50] they could have would be in the human
[21:51] spirit or mind in the old testament
[21:54] now here's the scripture where jesus
[21:56] says on the the last day of the feast of
[21:59] tabernacles she said come drink if any
[22:01] man's thirsty come he said this is
[22:03] speaking of the holy ghost because jesus
[22:05] was not yet give i'm sorry the holy
[22:07] ghost is not yet given
[22:08] because jesus was not yet glorified
[22:12] god
[22:13] so a man like john the baptist the bible
[22:15] said he was full of the holy ghost in
[22:18] the mother's womb but that wasn't the
[22:19] soul that was the human spirit
[22:23] zacharias elizabeth all those old those
[22:26] old testament saints right at the end of
[22:27] the old testament transitioning into the
[22:29] new right in the gospels that's what i'm
[22:31] talking about the gospels the bible said
[22:33] they were filled with the holy ghost and
[22:35] prophesied that wasn't in the soul that
[22:37] was in the mind
[22:39] the bible said joseph was full of the
[22:40] holy ghost when he saw dreams the bible
[22:42] said bezolio was full of the holy ghost
[22:44] when he built uh the mercy seat and all
[22:47] those old testament tabernacle furniture
[22:49] pieces they were all filled with the
[22:50] holy ghost up here they had the new man
[22:53] up here but we're the ones who get the
[22:55] new man right here in the soul amen
[22:57] because the blood has done not just
[22:59] covered our sins but sent them away and
[23:02] abolished them never more no
[23:04] condemnation for you and i no guilt for
[23:06] you and i we're free from all
[23:08] condemnation
[23:10] because of the blood of christ
[23:13] hallelujah
[23:17] so here's the first one
[23:21] the therapist woman's
[23:23] son died elijah laid on him i think six
[23:26] times or breathed on six times and the
[23:28] bible said his spirit came back and
[23:30] revived
[23:32] see here's a case where revival meant
[23:34] you died now you're alive again we are
[23:36] going to have a great revival at the
[23:37] rapture amen the dead in christ arise
[23:40] amen that will be a great revival there
[23:42] praise god for the dead in christ
[23:44] here's another one uh
[23:47] a man's dead body would touch elisha's
[23:50] bones and that man revived
[23:54] so another a way another time revival
[23:56] means coming back from physically being
[23:58] dead
[23:59] genesis 4 here's jacob lost his son
[24:02] joseph right he thought he lost his son
[24:04] but then when he meets him he hugs him
[24:06] and the bible said his spirit revived
[24:09] that means he overcome that depression
[24:10] devil
[24:12] so all those years those was it 17 no 13
[24:14] years he was gone
[24:16] maybe more maybe yeah 13 plus years
[24:18] could it could have been more
[24:19] 13 years he was gone he was overcome
[24:21] with his with a depression spirit that
[24:25] made him a gloomy and upset and
[24:27] depressed all the time but when he sees
[24:29] joseph he gets that revival back he has
[24:31] a revival he feels alive again oh church
[24:34] we ought to feel alive in christ today
[24:36] praise god
[24:37] if we're the joshua church leave nothing
[24:39] undone
[24:40] make sure you cover all the bases right
[24:42] do everything you can make sure all
[24:44] relationships are right and you'll have
[24:46] the right kind of spirit
[24:47] you'll live in revival if you do that
[24:50] if you leave uh sins undone or
[24:52] relationships kind of checked and you'll
[24:54] never have you'll never have the peace
[24:55] of god you've got to go to every
[24:57] situation leave nothing undone clear all
[25:00] the debts right clear all the matters
[25:02] and then you can have peace with god
[25:10] samson was so
[25:11] weary after killing those
[25:13] uh philistines the bible said he got
[25:15] some water and he revived
[25:18] so emotionally and physically the water
[25:20] revived him
[25:22] so you can have a physical revival get
[25:24] some water and then emotionally too
[25:25] right
[25:28] he revived
[25:30] ezra now ezra was that he was a trained
[25:32] priest and he went back in the second
[25:35] group that went back to israel from
[25:36] babylon right
[25:38] zerubbabel was the first group and they
[25:39] built the altar
[25:41] and the house of god but ezra was coming
[25:43] back to bring the word
[25:45] right they had the temple but they
[25:46] needed the word they needed a teaching
[25:48] priest and that was ezra and he brought
[25:51] back the word the second stage
[25:52] sanctification amen and the wall was the
[25:54] baptism of the holy ghost because it
[25:55] sealed them in
[25:58] i don't know thank god i appreciate that
[25:59] about 12 years ago amen just come back
[26:01] to me fresh
[26:03] so ezra was either on their way and he
[26:05] felt ashamed oh i asked the king for
[26:07] guards where's my faith right
[26:10] and he said lord we've got a little
[26:12] space now grace has been shown us
[26:16] uh
[26:17] to give us a nail in this holy place
[26:18] that our god may lighten our eyes and
[26:20] give us a little reviving
[26:23] see church
[26:24] i appreciate his honesty he just wants a
[26:27] little revival
[26:28] and maybe that's all he could get in
[26:30] that day but we don't want a little
[26:32] revival we want a great revival amen
[26:36] i don't want a little blessing from god
[26:38] i want all the blessings of god amen
[26:41] i don't want a little bit of the gifts i
[26:43] want all the gifts of the holy ghost
[26:45] amen hallelujah
[26:47] i don't want a little bit of faith i
[26:48] want a mountain moving faith praise god
[26:51] amen
[26:52] we want a great revival praise god not
[26:55] just a little
[26:58] for we were bond men
[27:00] yet our god hath not forsaken us in our
[27:02] bodies see church even if you're bound
[27:03] by a complex today god will not forsake
[27:06] you
[27:07] just humble yourself go make it right
[27:08] i've had to do it many times numerous
[27:10] times
[27:11] complex about that brother and that that
[27:13] situation
[27:14] many times i've had to do it but when we
[27:16] do it we feel free
[27:18] we get out of the bondage there's no
[27:19] more captivity amen our spirits are
[27:22] revived hallelujah
[27:26] god
[27:27] has extended mercy and the sight of the
[27:28] kings of persia to give us a reviving
[27:32] so god anointed these heathen kings can
[27:34] you imagine that god anoints a heathen
[27:36] king so you can have a revival
[27:38] hallelujah may god grant it whatever it
[27:41] takes church to give us revival send it
[27:43] lord
[27:44] i don't care if you got to serve
[27:45] something up on the job i don't care if
[27:47] you've got to stare at heathen up on the
[27:49] job or something that happened god send
[27:51] revival so i can live in the power of
[27:54] the resurrection
[27:57] a heathen king had to get anointed so
[27:59] this guy could have revival
[28:02] oh my thank god for his mercy church
[28:05] see
[28:06] it brought a little revival
[28:10] little strength
[28:12] this isn't david though this is a
[28:14] psalmist he just prays for now this is
[28:16] what we need constantly church you know
[28:18] you have to say amen you have to raise
[28:19] your hand i know this you need joy
[28:22] i need joy
[28:24] everything sucks away joy right ba every
[28:26] time i check the news bad news bad news
[28:28] i'm like when are they when am i going
[28:29] to get the good news it just sucks away
[28:31] your joy constantly right everything's
[28:33] done to suck away your joy
[28:35] but this psalm writer says thou will not
[28:39] revive us again that that people may
[28:41] rejoice he's asking won't you revive us
[28:43] so i can have joy again
[28:45] oh church that ought to be our prayer
[28:47] lord won't you revive me so i can have
[28:49] the joy of my salvation amen
[28:52] i don't want to be a depressed christian
[28:54] i don't want to be a a beaten down
[28:56] believer i want to be joyful i want to
[28:58] be happy i want to sing the praise of
[29:00] god i want to be a light i want to be
[29:03] salt to this world
[29:06] won't you do that lord what do you think
[29:07] he'd say absolutely just repent of all
[29:10] your sin right repent of any sin you
[29:12] have and i'll gladly bring you the joy
[29:15] of your salvation back amen
[29:18] hallelujah
[29:21] why is he going to do it because he's
[29:22] going to be merciful
[29:24] the god of mercy
[29:26] grant us thy deliverance
[29:28] grant us thy salvation
[29:31] praise the lord
[29:35] the church i can just see a difference
[29:37] like from last night i can just see a
[29:39] difference in our church we at least
[29:40] have people smiling shouting saying amen
[29:42] raising their hands the church last
[29:44] night they were pentecostal but
[29:45] everybody was just dead the preacher was
[29:48] spinning around and he would bless his
[29:49] heart he was trying to get them pumped
[29:51] up but church when you're born again you
[29:53] don't need pumped up
[29:56] you've got the pump inside of your soul
[29:58] the whale of eternal life amen
[30:01] it's pushing me it's pumping me up
[30:04] praise god
[30:06] amen
[30:07] there are some times you need to kind of
[30:08] remember to tap your foot and get on
[30:10] that anointing again you need to revive
[30:12] your mind and your body praise god but
[30:14] in your soul if you just yield to it if
[30:16] you'll just uh really get down to
[30:18] business with god and realize you the
[30:20] river of life flowing inside of you
[30:24] you've got revival flowing out of you
[30:26] constantly praise god
[30:29] i'm not one day out in the movie
[30:30] theaters and then back in the pulpit the
[30:32] next day
[30:34] i'm not one out one day smoking
[30:35] marijuana and then back in the pulpit i
[30:37] am constantly in the presence of god i
[30:40] am constantly revived i have passed from
[30:44] death unto life amen i am revived in my
[30:48] soul my soul has the nature of god and
[30:50] i've just got to get my mind on the word
[30:52] every day and that brings my whole body
[30:55] into revival mode
[30:57] amen
[30:59] praise god but it must be done in the
[31:01] mind amen
[31:03] you must bring your body into subjection
[31:05] to the word of god
[31:10] so david
[31:14] david says though the lord be high yet
[31:16] he has respect unto the lowly
[31:19] see if you feel love don't worry god's
[31:20] right there with you
[31:22] he's with he's with you on the mountain
[31:24] he's with you in the valley church
[31:26] right david when it was last time you
[31:28] were chased down with a bounty on your
[31:29] head for you know 15 years
[31:31] none of us were
[31:33] right this man had the royal
[31:35] the royalty the king chasing him down
[31:37] but he could still
[31:38] utter a few praises out of there i could
[31:40] i could still sing to jesus oh magnify
[31:43] the lord with me come exalt his name
[31:45] forever
[31:47] he could still muster a few praises in
[31:49] the midst of his trials of church we can
[31:51] do the same today
[31:57] do i walk in the midst of trouble
[31:59] thou will revive me
[32:02] i feel trouble all around me but i'm
[32:04] depressed i feel trouble all around me
[32:06] but i'm angry i feel trouble all around
[32:09] me but the bible says as even if there's
[32:11] trouble around me god will just change
[32:13] the situation and there will come some
[32:16] moment when the holy spirit will strike
[32:17] me i'll confess my sin i'll say god a
[32:20] song will come on or a sermon will come
[32:21] on or you'll shake a brother's hand or
[32:24] shake a sister's hand and all of a
[32:25] sudden even the midst of trial god
[32:27] revives you the old man is thrown down
[32:30] and the new man stands up and he's ready
[32:32] to face the enemy amen
[32:34] he's ready to face the trouble because
[32:36] he's put off now and in the midst of
[32:39] trouble god sends revival praise god
[32:42] that's what shadrach meshach and
[32:43] abednego had praise god they had revival
[32:45] in the midst of the trouble praise god
[32:47] noah had revival in the midst of the
[32:49] trouble they all had revival in the
[32:52] midst of the trouble if we just look to
[32:54] god our deliverer
[32:58] god will complete or perfect that which
[33:01] concerneth me
[33:04] we'll get to that in the next joshua
[33:05] sermon
[33:06] joshua had all the inheritance
[33:08] everything that was his he owned it
[33:10] brother johnny caleb got all his
[33:12] inheritance i will fulfill all the will
[33:15] of god for my life
[33:18] hallelujah yeah one point i'm kind of
[33:20] preaching my message for tonight i
[33:22] better i better stop right there
[33:24] i better save a little bit there save
[33:26] some for the sequel
[33:29] oh my so david knew he could have
[33:31] revival praise god
[33:33] hallelujah in the midst of trouble
[33:36] that's where we find revival
[33:41] so
[33:42] 700 712 years before christ
[33:45] isaiah said for thus saith the high
[33:46] lofty one that inhabiteth eternity look
[33:48] at that high
[33:50] lofty one that inhabits eternity
[33:53] we're just trying to describe this man
[33:55] we're just trying to describe this great
[33:57] jesus that we love right the high lofty
[34:00] and he lives in eternity in other words
[34:02] way far above us he's so great but thus
[34:05] saith the lord amen thus saith the high
[34:08] lofty one i dwell in the high holy place
[34:11] with him also that is of a contri heart
[34:14] and humble spirit church don't you see
[34:15] it although he's up there when you
[34:17] humble yourself it's as if you're seated
[34:19] in heavenly places with him because the
[34:22] bible said he's nigh unto you when
[34:24] you're a broken and contrite heart the
[34:26] bible says our hope is behind the veil
[34:29] anchored in heaven hallelujah
[34:32] amen so when you're down and low and all
[34:34] contrite and humble and repentant it's
[34:36] as if in the spirit you're up there with
[34:38] the eternal one in high lofty places
[34:41] you're having communion with the eternal
[34:43] one
[34:44] you're having a revival brother
[34:48] sisters we're having revival when we
[34:50] humble ourselves and say forgive me lord
[34:52] i didn't mean to do that help me to make
[34:54] the right choice i'll make the right
[34:55] choice next time you are now seated in
[34:58] heavenly places you're no longer dead in
[35:00] your minds you are now revived
[35:09] my spirit needs revived
[35:11] my heart needs revived just humble
[35:13] humble yourself
[35:14] be contrite be out of your mouth
[35:17] speak instead of the first
[35:19] that's contrite humble you're not trying
[35:21] to be seen you're not trying to be
[35:21] noticed by man you're trying to be
[35:22] noticed by god
[35:25] that's how revival comes
[35:28] he said i'll not contend forever will i
[35:30] be always wrath for the spirit
[35:32] shall fail before me and the souls
[35:34] repent
[35:35] why why do people think
[35:37] god is going to burn people eternally
[35:39] with no end for just
[35:41] 50 years of sin here's the text we read
[35:44] revival came on the third day so this
[35:46] types 144 000 because one day
[35:49] peter says is like a thousand years now
[35:52] this is seven eighties this is even

[36:49] sight she that lives in pleasure is dead
[36:51] while she's alive that's a zombie that's

[36:55] zombie we've got a lot of church members
[36:56] today like that right even message
[36:58] people so we promised that israel again
[37:00] would have life in his sight she's been
[37:02] dead to these facts or to the facts and
[37:05] to the
[37:06] pentecostal feast

[37:12] church that means if we're in pentecost
[37:14] we're alive amen
[37:16] this is the revival to the soul
[37:19] israel received i'm sorry the 120

[37:36] haven't given up i haven't quit i'm
[37:38] pressing on toward the mark of the high
[37:40] calling in christ
[37:42] hallelujah
[37:49] so here hosea likens revival under
[37:52] growth in plants
[37:55] sometimes i run over plants with a
[37:56] lawnmower
[37:58] to my wife's disdain
[38:00] so forgive me honey i don't mean to
[38:02] but i noticed they grow back
[38:05] sometimes
[38:07] sometimes
[38:09] right now that's what he says
[38:11] when you dwell under a shadow church you
[38:13] revive as the corn
[38:16] and grow as the vine i've
[38:18] run thereof shall be as the wine of even
[38:20] your scent even the wine see there's a
[38:22] joy of stimulation
[38:23] the wine hallelujah the line of
[38:25] stimulation in other words god will give
[38:27] you some great revelation it'll
[38:28] stimulate you praise god i know
[38:30] everybody god's pouring out revelation
[38:33] after revelation praise god i'm happy to
[38:35] drink on the wine of god
[38:39] thank god amen i'm bringing forth new
[38:41] life all the time
[38:43] i'm growing as a christian
[38:45] before i couldn't face this but now i
[38:47] can face it
[38:49] because jesus told me only be strong and
[38:52] very courageous
[38:53] and no man no woman no preacher no
[38:56] anybody will stand before you all the
[38:58] days of your life and the church said
[39:01] if you're anointed the holy ghost and
[39:03] you're in the right church you have
[39:05] nothing to fear of there's nothing to be
[39:07] said about nothing to be discouraged
[39:08] about you are going to bring forth
[39:10] growth you're going to face that
[39:12] obstacle and you'll overcome
[39:16] i'm facing a couple this week so pray
[39:17] for me
[39:19] this is inspiring me to get some more
[39:20] things
[39:22] kind of talked about with some other
[39:24] people so not our church but outside of
[39:26] our church
[39:28] but if i heard then please come to me
[39:30] because i don't want to hurt anybody you
[39:31] know please
[39:32] if there's anything i've done wrong
[39:33] please let me know i'm happy to repent
[39:35] make it right if i'm wrong praise god
[39:40] habakkuk 3
[39:42] now remember this is a beautiful prayer
[39:44] this is after chapter one and two in
[39:46] chapter one habakkuk complains lord
[39:48] where are you the people aren't being
[39:50] judged evil's going on and god answers
[39:53] them and he said he said write the
[39:55] vision on the table he said wait upon it
[39:57] it shall come to pass it will not delay
[40:00] in other words god rebukes the prophet
[40:02] for complaining church god will rebuke
[40:04] us for complaining but then he'll give
[40:05] us the word
[40:06] he'll give us some encouragement praise
[40:08] god it's going to be plain on tables
[40:10] just don't worry it's going to come to
[40:11] pass just wait on it
[40:14] in other words you need more patience
[40:15] church
[40:16] right that's what god's saying we just
[40:18] need a little more patience just wait
[40:20] for it
[40:21] don't complain just wait it'll happen
[40:23] praise god
[40:25] so now habakkuk gets re he gets
[40:27] corrected by god
[40:28] and he prays oh lord have i've heard thy
[40:30] speech and was
[40:32] afraid
[40:34] see these people that it's all joy in
[40:36] the presence of the lord
[40:38] there should be brother bran calls some
[40:39] joy spells there should be joy spells
[40:40] like we just talked about wine but then
[40:42] sometimes when you're presence of the
[40:43] lord it's fearful
[40:46] yeah it's fearful angels all those
[40:48] things it's fearful but you see people
[40:50] laugh and joke about demons and god
[40:52] that's probably not god
[40:54] that's probably some demon right they're
[40:56] just entertaining demons thinking it's
[40:57] god or something like that satan can
[40:59] transform himself from a messenger of
[41:01] death to an angel light
[41:04] right oh lord revive thy work now church
[41:08] you know this
[41:09] god never stopped working
[41:12] but the prophet's like revive your work
[41:14] in other words
[41:15] do more things so i can see your work in
[41:17] this land does god ever stop working we
[41:19] just sing that song right waymaker
[41:20] america he never stops working never
[41:22] stop how do you believe that
[41:24] he never stops working so habakkuk is
[41:26] kind of
[41:27] asking not for god to do something god's
[41:29] always doing something he's saying let
[41:31] me see what you're doing
[41:33] let me see judgment brought down upon
[41:35] the earth god never stops working church
[41:37] don't let the devil ever tell you god
[41:38] stops working god is working for you he
[41:41] will perfect that which concerned with
[41:43] you amen he will finish the good work
[41:45] philippians 1 6 he will finish the good
[41:47] work that he started in you
[41:50] praise god
[41:52] so we got to understand this habakkuk's
[41:54] asking for something i can see
[41:56] but god never stopped working
[41:59] he said revive your work
[42:03] and if you read the rest of the chapter
[42:04] he's talking about bringing judgment on
[42:06] the wicked he's talking about the
[42:07] mountains falling he's talking about the
[42:09] oceans roaring
[42:11] see but i want you to know god never
[42:13] stops working let me say like this god
[42:16] don't need a revival i need the revival
[42:18] is that right church
[42:20] habakkuk's not you've got to understand
[42:22] what he's saying
[42:23] he's not saying god you need a revival
[42:25] no we need the revival praise god in
[42:27] other words let me see what you're doing
[42:30] let me see some of these heathens judged
[42:34] let me see some of the righteous exalted
[42:36] amen
[42:37] let me see you answer some prayers and
[42:39] heal the sick and feed the poor praise
[42:41] god and clothe those that are naked
[42:43] praise god let me see you move move in
[42:45] our midst jesus
[42:47] amen
[42:50] now that's the old testament those are
[42:52] almost all the old testament scriptures
[42:54] a couple i left out because they didn't
[42:55] really apply to this sermon or they were
[42:58] repeats
[43:00] so let's go the new testament so the new
[43:01] testament only has two scriptures on
[43:03] revival
[43:04] pretty easy study brother william
[43:06] i must admit i thank the lord for a
[43:08] little wasn't too hard today
[43:10] sometimes you know you know i like
[43:12] preachers sometimes you just they're
[43:13] like lord i i just jesus i don't know
[43:15] help me i'm yeah and that that's most
[43:18] times right but i'm just saying this
[43:19] wasn't too hard of a search this morning
[43:21] praise god i got up at four for some
[43:23] reason the holy spirit woke me up at 4
[43:24] 45 so i've been up kind of early today
[43:26] so must been get this message ready for
[43:27] you i tried to sleep in too
[43:30] all right now so the first time is
[43:32] romans 7 9
[43:33] for i was alive without the law once now
[43:35] of course that's when he's young he
[43:37] didn't know the law
[43:39] but when the commandment came sin
[43:42] revived
[43:43] and i died
[43:45] and the commandment which was ordained
[43:47] to life i found to be unto death
[43:50] so paul's talking about his youth when
[43:52] he first learned to the law his sin
[43:54] nature and his body rebelled against the
[43:56] law
[43:57] or revived it came alive right
[43:59] in other words when somebody says don't
[44:01] don't eat the cookies in the cookie jar
[44:02] what are you gonna do as a kid well
[44:03] you're probably gonna steal one right
[44:05] that's kind of what it
[44:06] is beforehand you didn't have the
[44:09] cookies or you didn't know about it but
[44:10] now you know oh there's cookies in there
[44:13] oh well i'll wait till dad's asleep i
[44:15] wait till mom's i'll wait till dad's out
[44:17] at work
[44:18] and see once you got the commandment
[44:20] don't touch him then your your sin
[44:22] revives don't you hate that when you're
[44:23] saying revise it
[44:24] yeah oh he does that amen stop reviving
[44:27] stay dead amen see you've got to crucify
[44:30] him again amen crucify that sin nature
[44:33] constantly paul said you must crucify it
[44:35] the affection than the lusts thereof but
[44:37] it's almost like the flesh when it
[44:38] happened it knows it can do wrong oh now
[44:41] i get to do wrong now that's going to
[44:42] revive
[44:44] and paul said when i did that i sinned
[44:46] he said then it became death oh i can't
[44:48] have any cookies in the cookie jar i
[44:49] can't have any of those things i i
[44:52] you die
[44:53] i know i'm guilty oh i'm so unworthy but
[44:56] then paul said later he said but with my
[44:59] mind i serve the law of christ
[45:01] see he had to train his mind to overcome
[45:04] that desire
[45:07] now for some of us we'll just eat too
[45:09] many cookies then we don't want anymore
[45:10] right
[45:12] no let's hope not
[45:14] we don't want diabetes church and i say
[45:15] that sincerely you don't want diabetes
[45:17] i've had some friends that have diabetes
[45:19] because they drink too much diet coke
[45:20] you don't want limit your sugar praise
[45:22] god
[45:23] let me
[45:24] limit it i've seen children with
[45:25] diabetes
[45:26] don't
[45:27] no no
[45:28] limit it
[45:30] okay back to the sermon all right
[45:33] so it deceived him right it deceives you
[45:36] oh it's going to taste so good that
[45:37] cookie it's going to taste so good
[45:40] it deceives you into disobeying the word
[45:42] and then you feel dead right it's death
[45:44] that's the one that's the one time
[45:45] here's the second time it's used in the
[45:47] revived is used in the new testament
[45:49] for whether we live we live in the lord
[45:50] whether we die we die lord whether we
[45:52] live thereof or die we are the lords for
[45:54] to this and christ both died and rose
[45:56] revived that's kind of like that song we
[45:57] say you're saying today buddy beautiful
[45:58] song
[45:59] he revived that he might be lord of both
[46:02] the dead and the living
[46:04] jesus body revived or came back to life
[46:07] when the holy ghost came upon it right
[46:09] in one place jesus said i'm going to
[46:10] raise up the body in the other place
[46:12] jesus said god's gonna raise up the body
[46:14] it's not two persons one person
[46:16] two manifestations amen
[46:18] two manifestations we've been looking at
[46:19] the godhead on wednesday night so that's
[46:21] why it's funny or it's fitting i'd
[46:23] rather say now i didn't want to stop
[46:25] there since it was a very short search
[46:26] so i went to the lexicon now
[46:29] three of them were actually scriptures
[46:31] one is just a mention of being revived
[46:34] in the days of jonas's life so jonas uh
[46:37] the father of peter i guess they had a
[46:39] little revival before peter's generation
[46:42] so let's look at these three words
[46:43] church so we get a better idea to prove
[46:45] all these things i've showed you that
[46:46] the revival comes in the mind for us
[46:49] once it's in the soul right the baptism
[46:51] holy ghost but then all the other
[46:52] revivals are up here in our minds
[46:58] okay so the first word
[46:59] i'm artanino's i'm not even sure how to
[47:01] say that and when the chief shepherd
[47:03] shall appear you shall receive account
[47:04] of glory that faith not away so the
[47:06] glory is always revived it's always
[47:08] growing so when you get to heaven it's a
[47:11] it's a growing revival
[47:13] amen praise god see you know how death
[47:16] death slowly creeps in here right
[47:20] i feel more and more tired all the time
[47:22] you get just as you get older you get
[47:23] more gray i grew up my beer last week i
[47:25] had all these gray hairs in there
[47:27] brother i'm like wait
[47:28] i mean come on
[47:30] i'm trying to take care of myself
[47:32] but it's slow death but heaven is the
[47:35] opposite
[47:36] heaven is slowly more and more life it's
[47:39] slowly slowly more rival revival and it
[47:42] doesn't stop it's eternal revival amen
[47:45] it's the opposite of of this this is
[47:48] slow death till complete death that will
[47:50] be life life life until complete
[47:52] eternity praise god amen so with each
[47:56] passing year we're going to feel more
[47:57] revived
[47:59] oh my we've had one age i can't wait to
[48:01] go to the next age i just feel stronger
[48:04] this age
[48:05] i can go visit i can speak a world and
[48:07] go live of course i want to be around
[48:09] jesus i don't really want to go to the
[48:10] world but of course i have all eternity
[48:12] so maybe i could take a little vacation
[48:13] you know
[48:15] each and every passing age of the cycles
[48:17] of eternity each time around i feel a
[48:19] little bit more revived and strong and
[48:22] thankful for all god's done i'll be able
[48:24] to praise him by the amen like i want to
[48:25] amen i don't know you'll be able to sing
[48:27] and praise him the right way because i'm
[48:29] getting more strength all the
[48:32] time oh my praise god hallelujah
[48:36] oh thank you jesus
[48:41] anna zayo and isaiah
[48:44] for this my son was dead and is alive
[48:46] again the prodigal
[48:48] so this is spiritual life again
[48:50] spiritual life again so repenting right
[48:54] now you can type that to the baptist
[48:56] holy ghost where he gets the new clothes
[48:57] and the ring of authority you can type
[48:59] that to the baptism of the holy ghost
[49:02] right because the bible said if we don't
[49:03] have the when we get the holy ghost we
[49:04] have robes of white
[49:06] right garments of white remember the the
[49:08] remember the fifth seal the jews they
[49:09] don't have robes he said you're going to
[49:10] get them later
[49:12] see so you can type that to repentance
[49:15] sanctification baptism of the holy ghost
[49:18] now revelation 20 but the rest of the
[49:20] dead live not again into the thousand
[49:21] years we're finished so revive means to
[49:23] physically live again as well
[49:25] revelation 20.
[49:28] third one
[49:30] a nap sucho an absolute joke the lord
[49:33] give mercy unto the house of ones the
[49:35] force for he oft refreshed me
[49:39] he often revived me
[49:42] brother i'm gonna tell you you have
[49:43] revived me this summer since you came
[49:44] brother i'm gonna tell you that
[49:47] each time i get fellowship with johnny
[49:48] revive me you know each one of you all
[49:50] your brothers whenever i talk to you i
[49:52] always feel revived
[49:54] you revive me you refresh me right
[49:57] because i get to see how god's working
[49:58] in your life
[49:59] or how you're obeying the holy spirit or
[50:01] you just say inspired things praise god
[50:05] or you sing an inspired song right it
[50:07] just it refreshes us see that's why
[50:09] church we need each other we give each
[50:11] other revival amen and god ordained it
[50:13] that way praise god that revival flows
[50:16] through the body not outside the body
[50:18] through the body praise god
[50:21] we need each other
[50:22] to revive each
[50:24] other don't feel revived come to church
[50:27] you'll get revived
[50:28] i'll revive you
[50:30] i'll come down if you want i can slap
[50:32] you on the lane and say come on brother
[50:34] is that right brother come on sarah come
[50:35] on i'll revive you
[50:38] no i won't do that all the time i don't
[50:40] do that too much
[50:42] oh sorry
[50:43] press the wrong button
[50:46] so paul says oh nephas oh no enough
[50:48] assault
[50:49] on sephora sorry
[50:51] sop me out sometimes we gotta go looking
[50:53] for our brethren
[50:54] to refresh them
[50:57] where's that brother
[50:59] where's that sister let me give him a
[51:00] call real quick
[51:02] the lord grant unto him that he may find
[51:04] mercy in the lord in that day and how
[51:05] many things he minister he served my he
[51:08] met my needs
[51:10] ones the forest maybe brought food
[51:13] maybe brought a new song i don't know
[51:15] maybe brought another cloak
[51:17] because this is yeah that's right of his
[51:18] life maybe
[51:20] i don't know you know
[51:21] just you can use your imagination he
[51:23] brought the needs that paul needed in
[51:25] prison and he said he often refreshed me
[51:29] this guy always revives me
[51:31] church i want to be one of those kind of
[51:32] saints don't you
[51:34] sister don't you want to be the kind of
[51:35] a sister when you talk to other sisters
[51:36] you revive them
[51:39] you just give them a fresh
[51:40] jolt of joy
[51:42] amen praise god amen you just make
[51:45] somebody happy you just make somebody
[51:47] sweet again you make them joyful you
[51:50] know church that's what we need to be we
[51:51] need to be encouraging one another we
[51:53] need to refresh one another
[51:59] that's true
[52:01] that's true church we can really revive
[52:02] each other
[52:04] so
[52:06] emoji checkmark
[52:08] that's all the bible verses on revive
[52:11] very simple study right very easy so we
[52:13] can't take something so simple and
[52:15] confuse it
[52:17] like a lot of people do
[52:20] oh you need saved again
[52:23] you need a revival again
[52:25] you're dead and my soul can never be
[52:28] dead
[52:31] we need a week-long revival well you
[52:33] don't have to have the bible doesn't say
[52:34] you gotta have a week-long revival it's
[52:36] really gonna get you revived
[52:37] but you should be doing that on your own
[52:40] right
[52:42] you know
[52:43] where does it ever mandate you gotta
[52:44] have an all-night prayer meeting it's a
[52:45] good thing but where does it mandate it
[52:47] in the bible jesus taught his disciples
[52:50] how to pray
[52:51] he didn't say you have to have all night
[52:52] prayer meaning to be revived
[52:54] those are good things if you're seeking
[52:56] god and church if you seek god you will
[52:58] find him amen i'm not discouraging that
[53:01] i'm just saying sometimes we hear
[53:03] statements and if we're not doing these
[53:04] things then we feel discouraged this in
[53:06] church we're not we're not to be
[53:07] discouraged we have no condemnation if
[53:09] god is for us who can be against
[53:12] [Music]
[53:13] but the one thing we can do is make sure
[53:16] our minds are revived and that will
[53:17] revive our bodies as well so we can do
[53:20] the work of god
[53:26] so now we have to understand every quote
[53:29] from brother branham
[53:30] and any other preacher according to the
[53:32] bible definitions of revival did you see
[53:35] any bible verse that said you need
[53:36] revived in your soul many times
[53:38] i didn't see that
[53:40] do you ever see a scripture where it
[53:41] says your soul needs sealed and resealed
[53:43] and re-sealed again do you ever see any
[53:44] scripture on that
[53:45] yet people will preach it
[53:47] they'll say you need to born again again
[53:49] i was i was born again one time i don't
[53:51] need to be born again what i need is a
[53:53] revival of my mind that's what i need
[53:54] praise god i need my first love back
[53:57] because if i got my first love i'll act
[54:00] like i did at the beginning i'll do the
[54:02] first works come on church that's what
[54:03] we need we need to do the first works
[54:05] because works is your faith expressed
[54:07] amen if you've got real faith you'll do
[54:09] the right works amen
[54:14] you didn't lose your faith your faith
[54:16] had just been a little bit hindered
[54:18] your house might have got spoiled your
[54:20] mind might have got spoiled a bit it
[54:21] happens to all of us don't feel bad i'm
[54:23] not condemning anybody we just got to
[54:24] condemn the devil
[54:26] all right we got to confess sin right
[54:28] and get sin under the blood
[54:32] so here let's try to understand some of
[54:33] these quotes if we can here
[54:37] yeah so these were that that was my
[54:39] reminder list i don't i don't really
[54:41] need that
[54:43] so brother ham said we need a revival
[54:44] every day in our human spirit how many
[54:45] can say amen to that
[54:47] how can i overcome after the seals now
[54:49] look at this church
[54:51] here's my text this morning
[54:54] i chose this because i think it's a time
[54:56] that we should never let the spirit of
[54:58] revival die
[55:01] we've got to keep in revival constantly
[55:03] revive every day
[55:06] paul said he had to die daily that
[55:08] christ could live and we must never let
[55:09] that revival die within us
[55:13] the revival is never outside of us in
[55:15] some special meetings or on a preacher's
[55:18] ipad the revival's always in us church
[55:22] right
[55:22] the revival is in us and we've got to
[55:25] get out the trash we're going to see
[55:26] that quote familiar quote but eventually
[55:28] got to get the trash out that brings the
[55:30] revival now god can use the preacher god
[55:32] can use the special meanings but there's
[55:34] no excuse we shouldn't have revival
[55:37] every day of the week
[55:39] i know you
[55:41] you can even you can even be tired and
[55:42] worn out in your body but still have
[55:44] revival
[55:45] you can sit back on your couch on your
[55:46] lazy boy on your day off and just listen
[55:48] to songs and listen to brother branham
[55:50] or listen praise the lord and just smile
[55:52] and praise god and you can still have
[55:54] revival
[55:55] hallelujah
[55:57] because the revival's up here
[55:59] the revival's here if you already got it
[56:01] here it's right here is where we need
[56:02] the revival
[56:09] so see the revival in the human spirit
[56:11] returns you to your first love or your
[56:12] first works
[56:14] your first thoughts right and this all
[56:16] ties in with seek ye
[56:18] first the kingdom of god
[56:21] first love first works doing what you
[56:24] know should be done first
[56:27] hallelujah
[56:30] revival doesn't mean getting new members
[56:32] it's reviving what we've already got see
[56:34] i was watching the waves on lake
[56:35] michigan the great revival ah i like
[56:38] that we're going to see that later
[56:40] they're coming in a great tide sweeping
[56:41] it out i thought my you know it reminded
[56:43] me the song floods of joy over my soul
[56:45] like the sea village is that what nature
[56:47] reminds you of
[56:48] it should remind you of oh that's the
[56:50] joy of god that's the blessings of god
[56:52] on my life
[56:53] instead of instead sometimes rain all
[56:56] rain it's depressing uh
[56:58] nothing the sun's not shining in my life
[57:00] you gotta look at rain like that's the
[57:01] blessing i'm gonna get the latter rain
[57:03] i got the former rain i'm getting the
[57:05] ladder ring too praise god
[57:07] let nature speak good things to us
[57:09] praise god
[57:12] he thinks of a song about joy watching
[57:14] the waves come in
[57:15] that's what we need my our minds on is
[57:17] the things of god the the good blessings
[57:19] of god
[57:21] see the waves start somewhere out in the
[57:23] laker ocean as they come they build up
[57:25] momentum all the time then finally they
[57:27] strike the shore they go out come in
[57:28] again now church that's what we should
[57:29] see we should see momentum in our lives
[57:32] in other words i see god moving me to do
[57:34] something
[57:36] right and i feel stronger about this now
[57:38] than last year
[57:40] that's how i feel about witnessing now
[57:42] they got my book i i felt the momentum
[57:44] coming so i just got to go do something
[57:46] now i've got the momentum i'm having
[57:49] revival
[57:50] praise god amen
[57:52] so you'll feel the momentum i feel god
[57:54] leading me to believe this i feel god
[57:56] leading me to do this and it should it
[57:58] should do that it should and it should
[58:00] move out any fear amen it should move
[58:02] out any unbelief the revival of god
[58:05] should grow in our lives amen
[58:09] that's what the type is
[58:11] the
[58:14] bible grows so each service i get a
[58:16] little closer to that desire each
[58:18] service i'm closer i feel the momentum i
[58:20] feel the blessing coming amen i feel the
[58:22] healing coming i feel the soul being
[58:24] saved i feel revival for me i feel the
[58:26] change of the enemy going to be broke i
[58:28] feel it moving it's moving inside of me
[58:34] looks like we could use some revival

[58:39] that's the way the waves of god's glory
[58:41] does
[58:43] it's a glory rule praise god
[58:45] it's a wave of glory rolling over us
[58:50] it just rolls over and over back and

[59:34] the use of that during churn of the
[59:36] waves nature has a way of taking care of

[1:00:49] i'm pouring out my strength my soul i
[1:00:51] believe this with all my heart
[1:00:54] people want to have special meetings
[1:00:55] that's great special meetings are fine
[1:00:56] we have them too or conventions or
[1:00:58] things like that but the real believer
[1:01:00] can have revival in any service anytime
[1:01:03] no matter if it's just the pastor
[1:01:05] preaching because it don't matter about
[1:01:07] the pastor it matters about the glory
[1:01:09] praise god
[1:01:11] the ways of glory is what matters praise

[1:01:32] kind of like this morning
[1:01:34] nothing unusual going on
[1:01:37] nobody
[1:01:38] maybe nobody special visiting nobody
[1:01:41] nothing going on
[1:01:42] he said but yet there's just as much god
[1:01:45] in your heart
[1:01:47] as there is when you're jumping up and
[1:01:49] shouting
[1:01:51] and the church said
[1:01:53] see it don't have to be a special thing
[1:01:56] right
[1:01:57] it's just god moving you with the word
[1:01:58] of god each service it moves you it
[1:02:01] moves you into revival it moves all the
[1:02:03] trash out of her life that your soul can
[1:02:05] sing the blessings and the worship of
[1:02:07] jesus christ
[1:02:09] oh i'm so thankful for god's revival
[1:02:12] i know i'm revived church
[1:02:14] i thought why do they do that same
[1:02:16] reason god has the same reason he put a
[1:02:18] revive in the ocean put in the lake the
[1:02:19] water turning up and down takes all the
[1:02:21] trash out of the water throws up in the
[1:02:23] bank i think that's a good thing that we
[1:02:24] have revivals kind of get all the
[1:02:26] superstitions away from us
[1:02:28] all the world out churning it out and
[1:02:30] throw it out on the bank
[1:02:33] if there's any world in us let's throw
[1:02:35] it out in the bank today
[1:02:37] don't keep it in here
[1:02:38] don't especially don't keep it up here
[1:02:41] get it out confess it get it out and
[1:02:44] have revival
[1:02:46] alive again that's what i told the amen
[1:02:48] when we went to that church i was so
[1:02:49] nervous last night it was about six
[1:02:50] o'clock i was almost shaking brother i
[1:02:52] was so nervous and i thought wow i need
[1:02:54] to really uh be thankful for all the
[1:02:56] visitors that we have
[1:02:58] like our church don't even look like a
[1:02:59] church
[1:03:01] so for people to come in here they got
[1:03:02] to have a lot of courage
[1:03:04] so i thank the lord for all of our
[1:03:05] visitors that we had over the years you
[1:03:07] know visiting but i was shaking so
[1:03:08] nervous the more we talked the better i
[1:03:10] felt by the time we got in there i stood
[1:03:12] up and gave a testimony at the end of
[1:03:13] the service when johnny got healed and
[1:03:14] god gave us our our tax return we waited
[1:03:16] four months to get our tax return i got
[1:03:18] it right after i prayed for it i said
[1:03:20] well thank you lord i can pay off that
[1:03:21] debt
[1:03:22] hallelujah just this week i thought that
[1:03:24] was such a blessing
[1:03:27] i was able to stand up there
[1:03:29] see because church the fear will come
[1:03:30] upon you but we got to overcome that we
[1:03:33] got to just get in the holy spirit got
[1:03:34] to put off the old man put on the new
[1:03:36] man by the grace of god
[1:03:39] and i remember that scripture paul said
[1:03:41] i preached it last week we have battles
[1:03:43] with terrors without and fears within we
[1:03:46] all battle fear
[1:03:47] i told brother amen i said that's when i
[1:03:49] know i'm alive
[1:03:51] when i'm so nervous i'm shaking inside
[1:03:52] that's when i know i'm really doing the
[1:03:54] right thing
[1:03:56] it's easy to come to church for most of
[1:03:58] us at least it ought to be
[1:04:00] but i got real nervous last night
[1:04:01] because one i'm doing what jesus said go
[1:04:04] into all the world and preach the gospel
[1:04:06] with every creature if they'll let me
[1:04:08] i was able to testify i wasn't able to
[1:04:09] preach but i was able to testify praise
[1:04:12] god that god has sent a message and the
[1:04:14] mystery of god is finished praise god
[1:04:17] and we are prophesying again hallelujah
[1:04:20] to every nation king your tongue and
[1:04:21] people that's our responsibility that's
[1:04:24] the scriptures that's fulfilled today
[1:04:30] 59
[1:04:31] when the brandon tabernacles have
[1:04:33] revival i want one myself i just don't
[1:04:35] want to happen the building i want to
[1:04:36] happen to me i want a closer walk so you
[1:04:39] can have revival every day and the
[1:04:40] prophet needs revivals
[1:04:43] but we already know he's born again
[1:04:45] so it must be in the human spirit
[1:04:50] he's talking about moses why christ
[1:04:51] speak
[1:04:53] what audit do to us we need a repentance
[1:04:55] we need a revival i'm saying myself see
[1:04:58] i need a shaking i need something i said
[1:04:59] i was speaking to myself this morning or
[1:05:01] about myself i need awakening up
[1:05:04] this is
[1:05:06] less than one month after he preached
[1:05:08] standing in the gap when brother branham
[1:05:10] admitted he had a complex and he asked
[1:05:12] how many have complexes brotherham said
[1:05:14] every hand went up
[1:05:16] now i'm not going to ask this morning
[1:05:18] but be honest if you have a complex you
[1:05:20] need to get rid of it
[1:05:22] i hope our church is mature enough where
[1:05:25] if i ask how many have complexes maybe
[1:05:27] one or two hands go up
[1:05:28] but brother answered almost the whole
[1:05:30] church
[1:05:31] and he said for that he said that's he
[1:05:33] said that's how it is in a lot of
[1:05:34] churches but church why would we want to
[1:05:37] live our lives
[1:05:38] where satan has a complex buildup in our
[1:05:40] minds and we're always struggling with
[1:05:42] that person or that situation why don't
[1:05:45] we clear it out
[1:05:47] we got waves of glory to wash it away
[1:05:49] brother we got swords of this of the
[1:05:51] holy spirit to chop those stones down we
[1:05:54] have all these mighty weapons of warfare
[1:05:56] why should we live in complexes when we
[1:05:58] can live in free men free women under
[1:06:01] the joy of the lord and enjoy the
[1:06:02] salvation god has given to us why don't
[1:06:04] we do that we ought to praise god
[1:06:07] you ought to
[1:06:09] i ought to
[1:06:14] like i said there's two or three people
[1:06:15] i'm going to reach out to this week
[1:06:17] and these things have come up from years
[1:06:18] ago i just forgot about them i'm going
[1:06:20] to try to keep everything i'm going to
[1:06:22] try to finish all the work like joshua
[1:06:25] he left nothing undone that's what i
[1:06:26] want to be
[1:06:28] one brother called me one brother called
[1:06:31] me brother brooks brother craig brother
[1:06:33] cam and brother randy goliaths and
[1:06:35] goliath and his four brothers
[1:06:38] and someone gave me the tape of that and
[1:06:40] i heard it the next week i'm like you
[1:06:41] just go and you're acting like you're my
[1:06:42] friend and you just call me goliath
[1:06:45] so i got to talk to him about that that
[1:06:46] was years and years ago when i was still
[1:06:48] going to bible believers
[1:06:51] there's another situation i better not
[1:06:52] say too much about that one but
[1:06:54] uh
[1:06:55] i'll preach it i'll share it later lord
[1:06:57] willing to help you out to see to let
[1:06:59] you know that i've got things i got to
[1:07:00] deal with too
[1:07:02] but we ought to be striving to have
[1:07:04] constant revival
[1:07:06] with no complexes
[1:07:08] all right but i said you got a little
[1:07:09] funny feeling that's a little tiny
[1:07:10] complex building
[1:07:12] right
[1:07:13] get rid of that
[1:07:14] do something about that
[1:07:16] now
[1:07:17] we talked about this with lydia you know
[1:07:18] she's grown up in the kids if you just
[1:07:20] have a bad fee a bad thought you don't
[1:07:22] have to go confess that
[1:07:24] right if satan just puts a thought in
[1:07:25] there about somebody you have to go
[1:07:26] confess that because you didn't act on
[1:07:28] that exactly
[1:07:29] right so we the children have great
[1:07:31] questions i just thought that was a
[1:07:32] great question
[1:07:33] oh yeah that's such a i never thought
[1:07:34] about that because i'm this warrior and
[1:07:36] i'm fighting all the time and mind
[1:07:37] battles and battles here battle's there
[1:07:39] you know i forget what it's like to be
[1:07:41] the young warrior
[1:07:44] 17 years in this message
[1:07:46] uh 20 actually 20 yeah yeah send it
[1:07:48] start preaching to it right right a
[1:07:50] couple years afterwards
[1:07:51] but that yeah if just because you have a
[1:07:52] mind battle doesn't mean you got a
[1:07:54] complex or you have to go confess that
[1:07:56] right you've got to change your thoughts
[1:07:59] now if you sit said something about
[1:08:01] somebody on and hurt them and did
[1:08:02] something then yes you need to go make
[1:08:04] that right
[1:08:05] if you act
[1:08:07] upon the temptation if you get into the
[1:08:09] temptation
[1:08:10] remember there's four steps to sin right
[1:08:11] go to james one this will help somebody
[1:08:14] believe it's holy spirit
[1:08:16] there's four steps to sin just like
[1:08:17] there's four horse riders church just
[1:08:19] like there's four insects right palmer
[1:08:21] cankerwood caterpillar
[1:08:23] james 1
[1:08:26] verse 14. there's four steps
[1:08:29] and where you're just getting tempted
[1:08:30] that's not sin you have to go confess
[1:08:32] that to somebody but when the sin has
[1:08:34] conceived and brought forth then you
[1:08:36] have to go make it right
[1:08:39] so there's four steps look at verse 14.
[1:08:40] when every man is tempted he's drawn
[1:08:42] away from his own lust and enticed
[1:08:46] okay so you're tempted
[1:08:48] and then enticed
[1:08:50] see tempted if just because you're
[1:08:51] tempted doesn't mean you've sinned
[1:08:53] you're not enticed yet
[1:08:56] okay what's the third step verse 15.
[1:08:58] then when lust hath conceived it brings
[1:09:00] forth
[1:09:01] sin and sin is death i'm sorry i got no
[1:09:03] wrong i'm sorry tempted is first and end
[1:09:06] times tempted entice is the first one
[1:09:08] yes and then uh
[1:09:11] sin less conceived sin than death
[1:09:13] there's the four steps
[1:09:15] just like there's four horse riders
[1:09:17] church
[1:09:18] that's why the seven seals are so
[1:09:19] powerful
[1:09:20] because it shows off it shows the battle
[1:09:22] through the church ages but it shows our
[1:09:24] daily battle right now battling the
[1:09:26] antichrist spirit i'm gonna get victory
[1:09:28] over the antichrist spirit today
[1:09:30] if you are you're keeping those
[1:09:31] temptations at bay you're destroying the
[1:09:34] enemy's temptations you're casting them
[1:09:36] down you're driving them back you're
[1:09:37] protected by the shoot of faith you are
[1:09:39] overcoming the holy spirit is conquering
[1:09:42] not the unholy antichrist spirit
[1:09:46] so church the four stages
[1:09:48] lust enticed
[1:09:51] let me look at it again
[1:09:53] lust and see oh we're not going to do
[1:09:55] that i can do that lesson
[1:09:58] actually doing it and death
[1:10:01] death feeling that feeling that
[1:10:03] separation from god
[1:10:05] okay
[1:10:06] how many like bible numerology
[1:10:08] maybe i'll preach for that again no
[1:10:10] i'm just kidding that's a great that was
[1:10:12] a great series though that was that's i
[1:10:14] needed that one that was the holy spirit
[1:10:15] feeding me
[1:10:16] okay so here it is so brother and says
[1:10:18] oh yeah he just said
[1:10:20] i need a shaking
[1:10:22] a month earlier he says i cannot go
[1:10:25] he admits i can't go out to the other
[1:10:27] churches
[1:10:28] until i feel differently in my heart
[1:10:29] about it
[1:10:31] something's got to change me in my heart
[1:10:33] if i go there with a feeling i still
[1:10:34] gotta i still feel the way i ought to
[1:10:36] have heard that message they ought to
[1:10:38] have done it i don't have the feeling
[1:10:39] for the people that i should have until
[1:10:41] i get that feeling there's no need of me
[1:10:42] going because i'd be a hypocrite
[1:10:45] see complexes make you a hypocrite
[1:10:47] that's right yet you're still sealed in
[1:10:49] your soul brother
[1:10:51] you can be a hypocrite
[1:10:53] and be sealed in your soul yes up here
[1:10:56] you're a hypocrite in your mind
[1:10:58] your soul is saying
[1:10:59] repent you're so saying they're sweet
[1:11:01] people i love them but your mind's
[1:11:02] saying i'm not going to preach them i'm
[1:11:04] not going to give them another chance
[1:11:05] i'm not giving my dad or i'm not giving
[1:11:06] my mom another chance no way no
[1:11:09] hypocrite
[1:11:11] hypocrite and doesn't do you any good
[1:11:14] until you get that out of there
[1:11:16] praise god
[1:11:17] you won't be able to help them any bit
[1:11:19] until you get the complex cleaned out of
[1:11:21] your life
[1:11:25] revival
[1:11:27] how many need revival
[1:11:30] every day brother jesse
[1:11:32] lord jesus every day i need revival
[1:11:34] every day
[1:11:38] brides revival third seal
[1:11:40] the bride hasn't had a revival yet
[1:11:42] see there's been no revival there no
[1:11:44] manifestation of god to stir the bride
[1:11:46] yet see we're looking for it now now
[1:11:47] look at look at the context what's he
[1:11:49] talking about it'll take those seven
[1:11:51] unknown thunders back there
[1:11:54] to wake her up again he'll send it he
[1:11:57] promised it
[1:11:58] if you listen to the seven seals brother
[1:12:00] brahms always talking about the thunders
[1:12:02] connected to the rapture
[1:12:04] but a year later god had showed him no
[1:12:06] the thunders were revealed those were
[1:12:08] the voices of the the revelations of the
[1:12:10] seven seals
[1:12:13] so he never talks like this anymore
[1:12:15] afterwards
[1:12:18] don't let us tell me your church look at
[1:12:20] your life look at the word
[1:12:22] don't let this quote stump you
[1:12:24] in other words he says the bride hasn't
[1:12:26] got the seven sealed book yet
[1:12:28] amen the bride hasn't received the seven
[1:12:31] sealed open book the book the mystery
[1:12:33] hasn't been finished yet but now it's
[1:12:35] finished amen
[1:12:38] hallelujah thank you jesus
[1:12:40] the next year brother said the seven
[1:12:42] thunders were the revelations containing
[1:12:43] the seven seals this means the bride
[1:12:45] should have revival
[1:12:48] but in that context he was no doubt
[1:12:50] referring to the latter rain or the
[1:12:51] rapture
[1:12:55] a man came up to brother ram tried to
[1:12:57] trick him the man said oh with your
[1:12:59] experience you should be able to write a
[1:13:00] bible yourself
[1:13:02] he said that might be true but see i
[1:13:04] couldn't do that
[1:13:10] but look you not one word can be added
[1:13:13] nor taken away praise god church even if
[1:13:15] you don't understand the thunders don't
[1:13:16] worry it's in here it's not out there
[1:13:19] it's in here
[1:13:20] and i'll tell you it's in the seven
[1:13:21] seals praise god
[1:13:23] because the thunder is a voice of god
[1:13:25] and every time brother man preached
[1:13:26] those seals i love it he finished the
[1:13:28] second the second seal he said that's
[1:13:30] thus saith the lord amen
[1:13:32] he just thunders it out in other words
[1:13:34] that's the voice of god hallelujah
[1:13:36] that's the thunder of the voice of the
[1:13:38] son of god that was jesus christ
[1:13:40] revealing that praise god amen
[1:13:42] the thunder of the holy spirit
[1:13:45] thundering it out seven right in a row
[1:13:47] he said
[1:13:48] seven days in a row
[1:13:50] seven days of the revelations of god
[1:13:52] he's trying to catch me in that
[1:13:55] well the seven thunders wouldn't them
[1:13:57] seven thunders blasting out wouldn't
[1:13:58] that be a revelation give to some man no
[1:14:00] sir
[1:14:01] it would be something
[1:14:03] it would be something added something to
[1:14:05] it or taken something from it it's all
[1:14:07] revealed in there in the seven seals
[1:14:10] opened up that revelation of what that
[1:14:12] was
[1:14:13] that's what it was
[1:14:15] praise god it's still in the word
[1:14:21] you see you can't get out of that word
[1:14:24] that's where every messed church goes
[1:14:25] wrong or anybody when they leave the
[1:14:28] word of god everything we believe must
[1:14:31] be in the word of god
[1:14:36] god's spirit will never leave that word
[1:14:40] church that's why we need the bible
[1:14:41] preach more than anything we need
[1:14:42] brother ramsey's close but we need the
[1:14:43] bible to praise god
[1:14:45] the holy spirit will never leave the
[1:14:47] bible praise god
[1:14:51] i'll say right with that word
[1:14:53] blinding some and open the eyes of
[1:14:54] others i'll always do that
[1:14:58] and then a few months later
[1:15:00] have the seven thunders which equals the
[1:15:02] seven mysterious seals already been
[1:15:04] revealed
[1:15:05] no they were revealing the seven seals
[1:15:07] that's what the thunders was about
[1:15:11] so the thunders were remember remember
[1:15:13] the book open book came down to heaven
[1:15:15] and seven thunders uttered their voices
[1:15:17] that was the revelation of the seven
[1:15:19] seals brought to bran brother branham
[1:15:21] and seven days in a row the voice of god
[1:15:23] screamed out it's thus saith the lord
[1:15:26] praise god boy we're quiet on that one
[1:15:28] so just keep praying about that one
[1:15:29] church keep afraid about that one
[1:15:32] i don't know maybe you heard seven
[1:15:33] thunders other other places i don't know
[1:15:34] but it's clear to me church
[1:15:36] it's clear the bride has had revival not
[1:15:39] because we're eating the book amen
[1:15:41] we got we got how can we have honey in
[1:15:43] our mouth and the word of god in us and
[1:15:45] not be revived we're revived we have all
[1:15:48] the benefits of the open word praise god
[1:15:51] well at least i do i hope you do too
[1:15:56] now look brother adam says in 1964
[1:15:59] now this is what we saw last night by
[1:16:00] the amen all the preachers saying fast
[1:16:02] pray fast pray which we should
[1:16:04] but they were saying it and rejecting
[1:16:06] brother branham's ministry
[1:16:07] we should receive brotherhood's ministry
[1:16:09] and say fast pray
[1:16:11] that's my revelation from jesus
[1:16:13] jesus said when you fast when you pray
[1:16:15] when you give alms
[1:16:20] see why do they do that why do they call
[1:16:21] for fasting praying and reject they say
[1:16:23] there's no more revival everybody's
[1:16:25] complaining ministers why do they do
[1:16:27] that they want a great awakening they're
[1:16:29] crying believing there'll be a great
[1:16:30] awakening they're good people why is
[1:16:31] that what have they done they have not
[1:16:33] recognized the awakening of the bride
[1:16:40] see by being a christian they feel the
[1:16:41] pull of the hour they haven't recognized
[1:16:42] what's been done that's what's making
[1:16:43] them feel that way they know something's
[1:16:45] supposed to happen they see but we're
[1:16:46] looking way off in the future when it's
[1:16:48] already happened right by you
[1:16:50] glory praise god the bride's already
[1:16:53] been awakened right by us with the
[1:16:55] prophet ministry of malachi 4 praise god
[1:16:59] the bride's already awake
[1:17:00] she's already revived the thunders have
[1:17:02] already been been blasted out through
[1:17:04] the seven seals it's already happened
[1:17:06] but they're missing it they're letting
[1:17:07] it go right over their heads
[1:17:15] in the ninth one's the end time he talks
[1:17:16] about luther wesley azuza street
[1:17:19] he said where is the first revival come
[1:17:22] in the body of christ
[1:17:23] after a while she come up in luther so
[1:17:25] the reverse first revival came in luther
[1:17:29] and then here wesley come along with
[1:17:30] that revival
[1:17:33] he says the life went into the shuck you
[1:17:34] know this the shuck from almost
[1:17:36] perfectly like the wheat finally his
[1:17:38] father was made manifest in the last
[1:17:39] eight or ten years especially last three
[1:17:40] years now what does it do pull away from
[1:17:43] the wheat
[1:17:47] now why now church i want you to re read
[1:17:49] these yellow words with me okay
[1:17:51] shake yourself a little bit here
[1:17:53] shake yourself let's read this together
[1:17:55] on three one two three now why hasn't
[1:17:58] there been an organization startup in
[1:18:01] these last 20 years of this great
[1:18:04] what
[1:18:05] this great
[1:18:10] luther wesley revival
[1:18:13] leslie branham revival he says they had
[1:18:16] denominations after luther denominations
[1:18:18] after wesley he said we haven't had any
[1:18:20] revival in the last 20 years or so i've
[1:18:21] been preaching because we have a revival
[1:18:24] that doesn't end it's the baptism of the
[1:18:26] holy ghost amen
[1:18:28] now they had that too right but we don't
[1:18:30] have a lot of time right so here brother
[1:18:33] tells us his ministry is a great revival
[1:18:36] so see you have to take this quote with
[1:18:38] the other one that proves church we are
[1:18:40] in revival mode if we're born again
[1:18:43] praise god
[1:18:45] this ain't a little revival like ezra
[1:18:47] wanted come on church this ain't a
[1:18:49] little revival this is a great revival
[1:18:52] praise god
[1:18:53] this is something great god's healing is
[1:18:55] sick god's saving the souls god is re
[1:18:57] changing we're re-establishing lives
[1:19:00] he's he he's the potter fashioning the
[1:19:02] clay he's molding our lives just to look
[1:19:05] exactly like the book of acts
[1:19:08] oh thank the lord
[1:19:13] visible union some people stumble with
[1:19:14] this you talk about the character of the
[1:19:16] women
[1:19:17] that tells you how the church you're
[1:19:18] doing so we must have a pretty good
[1:19:19] church because we have some
[1:19:20] some real fine sisters that are real
[1:19:22] godly here today praise god
[1:19:24] watch when that spiritual bride when she
[1:19:26] begins to have a revival when she begins
[1:19:28] to come back to line up herself with the
[1:19:30] word of god watch then again you see how
[1:19:32] the scriptures at that time there will
[1:19:33] be a message sweet sweep out to catch
[1:19:35] that bride
[1:19:36] catch that woman the elect this was not
[1:19:37] his home church and brother i'm admits
[1:19:39] on tape i don't preach directly
[1:19:42] at uh other churches like i do my home
[1:19:45] church
[1:19:46] so his home church he said the seven
[1:19:47] thunder's already revealed
[1:19:49] the bride's awakened why can't the
[1:19:51] bride's alive we've had a great revival
[1:19:53] here the other churches
[1:19:56] he says when she begins to have revival
[1:19:58] can you catch that church can you catch
[1:20:00] that
[1:20:01] i hope you can by god's grace
[1:20:05] now if this quote's true
[1:20:07] then every generation has a chance to
[1:20:09] have revival
[1:20:11] then people then people can't say well
[1:20:13] the bride is not revival yet no
[1:20:15] every generation gets a shot at it
[1:20:18] praise god
[1:20:20] this is in the spoken word original see
[1:20:24] high breeding was started in eden
[1:20:27] uh covers up here in revelation now
[1:20:29] that's why each generation has its own
[1:20:32] revival it gets a chance at the word
[1:20:35] but instead denominations will hybrid
[1:20:38] the word
[1:20:39] but my mission i believe god's called me
[1:20:41] for
[1:20:43] is to forerun the coming word
[1:20:47] hallelujah see the coming word which is
[1:20:50] christ
[1:20:51] right that's what the voice said
[1:20:53] right as john the baptist before run the
[1:20:54] first coming so your message will
[1:20:56] forerun the second
[1:20:58] coming and level had a testimony that he
[1:21:01] got off the word really bad especially
[1:21:02] on the deity of christ he got he got off
[1:21:04] and he had a lot of things bad come out
[1:21:05] of his ministry uh but i watched a video
[1:21:07] of him recently i was trying to study on
[1:21:09] him a little bit
[1:21:11] and he said he said brother i made him
[1:21:12] specifically say in his books
[1:21:15] don't say uh you know he said you have
[1:21:17] to say uh as john the baptist four in
[1:21:19] the first coming he said brother branham
[1:21:21] said you have to say my message will
[1:21:22] forerun the second coming
[1:21:24] he said because don't point it didn't
[1:21:26] point the people to me it pointed the
[1:21:28] people to the message of god
[1:21:31] so brother man
[1:21:33] apparently levi over and over make sure
[1:21:35] you say the message for runs the coming
[1:21:37] the second coming of christ
[1:21:39] the word of god that we're feasting on
[1:21:41] today how many love the word of god
[1:21:42] let me bring this down to close i've
[1:21:44] already preached an hour have i warned
[1:21:45] you out
[1:21:47] okay i have okay so let me finish here
[1:21:49] i didn't hear a no so i guess i've worn
[1:21:51] out so forgive me that's okay i'm all
[1:21:53] stirred up that's okay i'm in revival
[1:21:54] mode you know you've that's that's fine
[1:21:56] yeah everybody's got their different
[1:21:57] times and seasons
[1:21:59] let me close with this here
[1:22:02] we are eagles
[1:22:04] in revival
[1:22:05] brother ram said those four beasts
[1:22:07] around the throne
[1:22:09] the lion oxman eagle he said those are
[1:22:12] thus saith the lord
[1:22:14] he said those and here it is the bible
[1:22:16] said they're round about the throne
[1:22:17] revelation 4
[1:22:18] lion calf man flying eagle they worship
[1:22:22] god brother says but those cherubims are
[1:22:25] actually sending of anointings as well
[1:22:28] they represent anointings that are sent
[1:22:30] as well
[1:22:32] but the eagle age the last age the
[1:22:34] prophetic age there's a rise a prophetic
[1:22:36] utterance to whom the secret always
[1:22:38] comes
[1:22:40] but now when it comes forth the eagle
[1:22:42] age that's the one that god always
[1:22:43] likens his prophets to eagles he calls
[1:22:45] himself an eagle the eagle goes so high
[1:22:47] there ain't nothing else can touch him
[1:22:49] not only is he up there he's built for
[1:22:51] that position when he gets up there he
[1:22:52] sees where he's at some people get up
[1:22:54] there and can't see where they're at so
[1:22:56] don't do no good to get up there
[1:22:58] now we find out the eagle age was
[1:22:59] promised in revelation 10 7
[1:23:03] and then malachi 4. now he means malachi
[1:23:05] 4. that would be in the last days that
[1:23:07] would be
[1:23:08] all right
[1:23:09] remember the four uh
[1:23:11] these four uh
[1:23:13] cherubims also type the four gospels in
[1:23:15] the book of acts
[1:23:20] brother man taught that in the
[1:23:21] revelation series in 1960 and 61. i
[1:23:24] preached on that a long time ago but
[1:23:26] it's there if you want to go listen to
[1:23:27] it
[1:23:28] the church prophets are always liking
[1:23:29] the egos look at this is the one believe
[1:23:31] the sign
[1:23:32] uh doesn't like when i shared it with
[1:23:34] them i think i shared it with them
[1:23:37] god said you've seen what i've done to
[1:23:38] the egyptians and how i i bear you on
[1:23:41] egos wings and brought you unto myself
[1:23:44] how did god bring them how did god bring
[1:23:46] israel on eagle's wings well here he
[1:23:48] says later
[1:23:50] your fathers cried unto them and the
[1:23:51] lord sent them moses and aaron which
[1:23:53] brought forth your fathers
[1:23:55] out of egypt
[1:23:58] eagle wings so two prophets or two men
[1:24:01] of god brought israel out on eagle wings
[1:24:04] on prophetic rings that means god must
[1:24:06] be jehovah papa eagle praise god
[1:24:10] right because he brought out his is his
[1:24:11] his people on eagle's wings and we know
[1:24:14] aaron was a prophet miriam was a prophet
[1:24:16] and we sure as you know moses was a
[1:24:18] prophet
[1:24:20] so they're brought out on eagle wings on
[1:24:23] prophetic wings of eagles
[1:24:26] ah i love that one when the lord showed
[1:24:28] me that one praise god
[1:24:30] on egos wings
[1:24:33] believers renew their strength like the
