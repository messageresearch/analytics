just have my brother right here praise God and brother William nice to have him here praise the Lord so thankful for God's grace so I'd like to go to revelation 17 I like to continue this series I don't matter what part this is was it 97 okay 97 or 98 okay so we're just gonna lay in some good things here tonight I think you'll be blessed well I know you'll be blessed if you love the Word of God so we're working our way through the book of Revelation and we're we're here in revelation 17 so it's really wonderful you know one my daughter's came up laughs after last service and said daddy I won't tell you I really enjoyed service on Wednesday night I thought what a blessing I sure he didn't hear that you know and the little ones like that they just soak in these things you know and and I always got to remember that there's there's little ones here and and they need to hear the truth just like we need to hear the truth just like in brother Graham's day you know people you know the revelation of water baptism was so fresh all the doubts were all the adults were shouting and glorifying God and today if we're not careful we you know we don't really pull as much maybe when there's water baptism preaching but we got to remember there's some that maybe have never been baptized and so we need to we need to pull for their sake right right we need to get in the spirit for somebody else's sake amen so god help us here tonight we're so happy and thankful to serve the Lord Jesus so revelation 17 I like to start at verse 1 but I may skip a few verses down I want to start with this thought about John admiring this woman it's quite a scripture so let's start at verse 5 here I'll read verse 5 and then we'll all read verse 6 Lord willing and then I'll read verse 7 I want to start there and if you remember we've been working through the eleven proofs that this woman is Rome that this Mystery Babylon is Rome some some recently think you know it's Jerusalem but there's a couple of things we looked at how it does have some things in common but not not enough it's got to be every Bible requirement and it certainly isn't Istanbul Turkey like a lot of people think - although it's on Seven Hills it doesn't it doesn't even get close to all the requirements so it can only be Rome now let's read verse I'll revert verse five and then we'll read verse six verse five says and upon her forehead was a name written Mystery Babylon the Great the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth and I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the Saints and with the blood of the martyr I'm sorry let's read verse 6 together I'm sorry one two three and I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the Saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus and when I saw her I wondered with great admiration I'll read verse seven here says they and the angel said unto me wherefore didst thou marvel I will tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the Beast that carrieth her which hath the seven heads and ten horns amen so let's just bow our heads for one more word of Prayer ask the Lord to help us your heavenly Father Lord your your the great one amongst us Lord where we know we're nothing Lord no flesh shall glory in your presence so father we glory in the cross we glory in the resurrection we glory that your Holy Spirit's here today Lord God and we're humbled by that for we realize that we're nothing Lord God but we ask Lord God that your spirit would come to quicken the Luas Lord and teach us Lord on this fresh bread of your word as we work in our way through revelation 17 Lord God anoint us and help us Lord God we want to draw closer to you Lord Jesus and we want to grow in grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord you said the mystery would be finished in this day and Lord we're looking at a great mystery tonight Lord so help us Lord may the Spirit of Truth and the spirit of Revelation come and especially to the young ones Lord even to the old ones give us fresh things but Lord even the young ones Lord just ingrain these truths in their heart Lord that they can receive truth Lord at this young age in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless yous being seated praise the Lord so let's look here to revelation 17 I believe this is part three of this chapter and I want to continue on these thoughts here grace I'm gonna be jumping from I got a few websites I'm gonna show you in just a moment so liddy you can actually switch over here and I'll just have these kind of ready to go so that st. basillica but we'll get to that in just a moment but let's just review real quick last time we were gathered together we went through the first six proofs that this woman is Rome so let's just preview those I'll just take one minute and just review those the first proof it had to be a woman or church so at that point you know it could be Rome or Jerusalem it couldn't be Istanbul because Islam is not a church under Christ so they they don't claim to be married to Christ they don't claim to be Christ's wife so right away that eliminates Istanbul although they're on Seven Hills they meet that one requirement they fail on this requirement right here so second is the Catholic Church is the matter of modern day Babylon now Jerusalem is called Sodom and Babylon Jerusalem is called that but of course we know the Roman Catholic Church is as well it's called Babylon Peter calls for Babylon in in the scripture as well but we're not going to review all that we've been through that now the third is the is the mother of harlots now again Jerusalem is called harlot we looked at that quite length at length and read the scriptures from Jeremiah and Ezekiel but of course the Roman Catholic Church is called the mother they call themselves and I quote the Mother Church the church from which every church took its start what she means though not every church every daughter Church because our church started on the day of Pentecost hey man I don't know yeah we're the same church that Abel was a part of amen we're all the way we could trace it all the way back by God's grace amen we're the same church but Jerusalem could be called a mother church some people might say oh the Holy Ghost first fell there so they might have that one and she's and no doubt Jerusalem is called a a harlot but the next one is where Jerusalem falls off because number four is she has to sit on many waters which are multitudes peoples nations and tongues there's 1.3 billion Catholics and right now there's the same amount of Muslims the Muslims have actually caught up to the Catholics and now they have the same amount of population that's 18 percent of the world is Roman Catholic almost 1/5 there's 22,000 parishes worldwide and in parish in nearly every country on Earth now compare that of course to the Jews there's all there's only about 8 million Jews in the world and most of them are in the US and Israel not around the world so it fails right there Jews are rejected at the United Nations Jews are mocked by every neighbor in the Middle East they don't sit on many waters they're not in many nations and not many tongues so right there Jerusalem cannot meet the requirement it has to be Rome amen thank God now fifth it sits on seven hills or mountains now Jerusalem meets that but it doesn't meet the other one Istanbul of course meets that but it doesn't mean any of the other requirements so it cannot be now Cincinnati's on seven hills I heard brother Graham say that today but there's no headquarters of any Church in Cincinnati except little local maybe non-denominational churches number six she had to be a harlot or to Christ now through now harlot means one who yields herself for defilement for the sake of gain and as also means a chief seed of idolatry so Jerusalem of course could meet some of these but because Jerusalem fails on the other ones the only one it could be is Rome because of her false doctrine and we looked at 7 false doctrines last time mandatory clerical celibacy so the priests have to be celibate that's that's called a seducing spirit and doctrine of devil transubstantiation is absolute idolatry it brings the sacrifice of Christ present to every one of their mass services and they say that that presence only remains in them while that bread and wine is in their body so it's flushed out every 12 hours that's why they got to keep going back I'm glad the Holy Ghost doesn't get flushed out amen I'm glad weather William that the Holy Ghost will never get flushed out of me because it's a sea they married at that point at the day of my Redemption the rest of my body gets swallowed up in that same type of spirit praise God so all three parts of me will be filled with the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah so it's it's it's idolatry next the Pope is called the Holy Father that blasphemes God because Jesus is the only one who called God holy father and they're so blasphemous that they Rob God the Father the miserable spirit they robbed that title from God and they give it to a man who falls short of the glory of God next they kiss of the Pope's ring which we saw that's documented on CNN is documented everywhere and they bow to Pope's and priests that's man worship and that breaks the first commandment to bow down and give worship to any person next they venerate statues and images they justified it at the Council of Nicaea and 787 ad but the Bible never the Bible never justifies idol worship and there's no virtue in any statue right there's no or there's no venerate there's no reason to venerate it or kiss it and these statues Church have spread around the world you see them all they're all around you drive around my hometown you see little Mary statues or or st. Joseph statues or whatever statues it's spread around the world and that proves it's spread idolatry under all nations my next is communion of saints and they literally say an exchange of spiritual Goods takes place between those in Earth and those in purgatory or in heaven and that's wrong they pray they pray for the dead that they may be loosed from their sins but the Bible said the blood of Jesus Christ already forgives you all your trespasses amen and there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus amen they say run to Mary they say actually the word fly they say fly to Mary and prayer to intercede to the dead my and brother they asked brother Branham what do you think of Catholicism mother Graham said I wish you would not have asked me that but since you asked me it's the highest form of spiritualism praying to the dead in other words praying to demonic spirits my the last one we looked at was deifying Mary she was called the all Holy One she was preserved from all stain of original sin that's a lie she's called a holy one she's called she said they say she has a saving office so she can save in her heavenly office that's blasphemy blasphemous as well they say she's the Queen over all things the mother of God advocate helper benefactress and Mediatrix but the Bible said there's one mediator between man and God the man Christ Jesus now look how close that is they call her Queen right but that's wrong that she's Queen over all things there is a real queen and it's us by God's grace not by what we've done but what he's done he's chosen his own bride and he chose her in him before the foundation of the world how do you know you're in that bride because you obey every word that's right in here because the bride has to be just as much the word as the husband the word amen amen that's right that's how we know we're the bride word because we keep all the Word of God and they say she's the mother of God but the Bible said that God has no father God has no mother oh the word Amen the word defends itself hallelujah all right so now let's pick up now where we are now let's start with a few quotes let me start with a few quotes from brother Branham about how John admired now look he admired Church now now imagine him imagine John in on the Isle of Patmos right it's just a real small islands kind of like Alcatraz right we say where it's just it's it's a I think it was how many miles think it was ten miles off off the coast land but imagine John being there but man said there were serpents and scorpions and he was just basically trying to live for his life and when he gets caught up in this vision he sees something like this and he sees the the priests all carrying the flags and they're all and they're all walking like this in procession and he's all these worshippers thousands upon thousands and he sees golden cups being raised and he says in he sees priests and these beautiful garments and there are you know there are worshiping and the Bible said John wondered with great admiration now you talk to any Catholic what's one reason they love Catholic is because they had they feel a spirit of reverence when they go to a church right same thing happens to me I went to a Catholic funeral this year I walked in there and I'm just like breath Tate I just lose my breath because all the beautiful artwork and the colors you know and and it's just and then the high ceilings you we're just so used to common buildings that when you walk in the place like that it just takes your breath away because it's physically beauty oh but that's what Cain had he had a more beautiful sacrifice and God's not interested in the Sutton in any sacrifice he wants a specific sacrifice so no doubt John brother Aaron would look at that picture there sorry and he would wonder and he say ma look at this beautiful building this is st. Peter's Basilica now the Catechism says when he sits on that seat and he speaks with authority they say he's infallible when he speaks from that seat I don't know if that seats out here or if it's inside but they said there's a seat in Saint Peter's Basilica and when he speaks from there it's infallible now what a perversion what a perversion because there is such a thing properly speaking with infallible you see that's why it's so close it would to see the very light if it were possible see that they caught like queen like we just said that's so close there is a queen in heaven but she's not Queen over all things amen there is a queen she's a blood ball queen amen she's a queen that rules because they were her godly character that she got from her husband amen and there is such a thing as infallibility in a man but it only comes with dust sayeth the Lord glory they don't come from sitting on a special chair it don't come from anything physical it comes from something spiritual the anointing and leadership of the Holy Ghost the inspiration from God Almighty hallelujah see what a perversion and no no doubt he look and remem I'm quoting from The True Vine in the false fire 1955 he said it's not a communistic anti God affair it's a religious spirit John saw in Revelations and he wondered with great admiration how it set like the Church of the Living God and so forth and yet in the it was found the blood of every martyr that had ever been killed for the Lord Jesus my so John looks at this in the ether smile what a beautiful gathering this looks beautiful I want to just share this if I can real quick I hope I got this okay I preached this a couple years ago but remember there's two sides right there's good spirits there's the Holy Spirit right and then there's I shouldn't say good spirits there's one good spirit and then there's all these evil demon spirits right but have said it won't be a communist experience oh sorry won't be communism it'll be a religious demon now these are exact quotes brother Graham said the spirit of unbelief is the chief of all Devils you can look it up why because when you wear someone's soul the greatest demon is unbelief to pull you to hell right and that's the demon that conquers people's faith right because it's either faith or unbelief right it's one or the other and so the greatest demon of all is unbelief we might call it the Antichrist spirit but in the scripture the Bible said the soul that doesn't believe it shall die so it's like the Antichrist spirit as far as I understand now under this you have other quotes from brother Branham he says the religious spirit is the worst demon to deal with and that's its truth it ain't the sinner ain't the harlot spirit ain't the drug-addict spirit it's that religious one like the Pharisees liked the Sadducees like we are born of Abraham seed we're born to the message we're greater than you what do you how can you teach us anything help us to be humble Lord God that we can always learn something from the Holy Spirit that's the worst one to deal with and now it's been opening up to me lately that that they knew Jesus was the Christ those Pharisees they knew it member Nicodemus he went and said we know you're a teacher sent from God a member in mark chapter 2 if you read mark chapter when I was reading it this week in mark 1 Jesus does all these miracles and the Bible said his fame spread all throughout Judea and Galilee everybody knew him everybody knew that this was the Christ and then he came to Simon Peters house and let down that man with palsy right and Jesus said I forgive you and the Bible said those chief priests reasoned themselves how can he forgive sin how can he forgive sin and Jesus rebukes them he said why do you reason in your hearts now how could Jesus rebuked them if for him forgiving sins the only way he could rebuke them and there's the Bible said they were scribes they knew the scripture the only way he could rebuke them for him forgiving sins a man forgiving sins is if they already believed he was the Messiah and they knew the scripture of what the scripture said about the Messiah and Isaiah 7:14 9:6 said he shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty God the everlasting father amen so that's the reason Jesus could rebuke them and say why do you reason your hearts isn't it easier for me to say receive your healing he said but that you that the son of man has power to forgive sins he said take up your bed and walk amen oh yeah raise God and what was he doing he was reed eel with that worse demon the critical spirit see that's been opening to me lately like they knew the scripture about him and they knew that he was something he needed when they knew he was sent from God just like Satan knew he said those demons do he said we know you're that Holy One of Israel they knew he was the Holy One but they didn't know he had to die to be resurrected a man didn't know that praise God it was hidden in one half of a scripture in Psalm 16 but where was a hidden motive just David hid it David hid and said my soul he will and it will be left in hell and my body won't see corruption amen and Satan knew that Scripture but he didn't know the interpretation of it amen so the Bible said that Satan anointed the kings of men of the earth to crucify him but they would not have crucified him had they known that through death he would defeat death amen hallelujah and so here's what we have we have this John wondering at this woman now let me let me just finish with here relevant said nervousness is the worst feeling you could have anyone could ever have he said a nervousness and distress is the worst feeling you can have isn't it Church if you're unsure if you're safe you're unsure you got the Holy Ghost you're unsure you're worried about something and you're so nervous about it you just feel like you're you're shaky unstable that's exact quote quote hide those words and the worst feeling anyone could have nervousness so when we come to church say God call my heart and we should pray and say God give me the peace that passes all understanding the Bible said if you just make your requests made known unto God the peace of God will keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus amen that's the glory of just coming to church in a hard week or when you're upset you're nervous you come to church and you're your burdens here you leave him here at the altar and know that God will take care of it amen his time and his season but we shouldn't be nervous because that's the worst feeling you could possibly have doesn't James say that a man that's tossed about he has no confidence to receive anything from God there is great power when people walk out of here or walk out of any church service by the Rays Church wherever there's great power when people say you know what I had a burden but I gave it to the Lord I'm committing it in God's hands oh there's strength in that amen there's peace and that there's victory in that we must commit it unto God brother says the power of committal is such a powerful thing see what is it because you cast down the demon of nervousness and God brings his peace that passes all understanding amen then brother have said about fear he said fear accompanies doubt the greatest thing he said that's the greatest thing against the church is fear so most of us church we're not gonna battle that one right if you're saved you're not gonna battle that one so much one you're gonna battle you and I fear all right we're scared what's gonna happen next it's my family going to be okay is God gonna provide for me we're scared we're nervous remember that's the greatest thing against the church he also said it was the greatest thing against the Old Testament Saints and that's why I got into your Christ had to go down to hell take the keys of death and raise them up and make a whistle-stop in Jerusalem to let them know there's normal reason to fear death you won't be in the heart of the earth you're going up to heaven to paradise amen I don't know about have said in Paradise the Witch of Endor could call people up he could call spirits up because there was no blood to protect them amen but in heaven you've got the blood of Jesus Christ to protect you amen and Satan can't access those souls he can't bring down Souls because the blood of Jesus Christ is your protection right now beware and always will be your protection amen hallelujah just like brother man prayed with the blood of Jesus Christ between you and your sickness put the blood of Jesus Christ between you and the devil always put it right between there the in Christ the Spirit of Christ is your protection amen thank the Lord now that's just for reference I came to me as I was preparing I was like I'd like to show that again so everybody can catch that throughout the week you're gonna battle it through out through your life you're gonna battle fear most did it or Satan will try to get you to thing all you can never be redeemed you know you know God will never answer your prayer you know no you shouldn't speak God's Word it's not the time in season you know how that dirty that devil is he tries to put spirits of fear on people but we got to have the spirit of faith amen the spirit of love because the Bible said faith works by love so we got to pray and get worshiping it so in love with Jesus that faith can start working by the love of God in our hearts amen let's go back there but Rahab said he wondered with great admiration now I want to read two more because I was looking at these earlier I want to read two more and why are we not a denomination he's John wondered with great admiration it was a Marvel thing about her how that I wondered he said let me just take John's place a bit and try to open it up a little bit see so he's gonna take John's place for the RAM said John said there she sits she's pertaining to be a Christian Church so John's looking oh she's claiming to be a Christian Church he said she's got all the access to the monies of the world now John would he would've never seen great things like buildings like this in his day there was nice buildings but nothing like this and so John immediately wonders with admiration while the church is rich now the church has so much backing she's got all kinds of money but Ram said John said she's got the kings of the earth at her feet right because he saw the vision all the kings of the earth wandered after her right he said she's a and colorful thing and how can she be brought drunk with the martyrs of Jesus how can she persecute the Saints how can she kill those martyrs of Christ and yet she's claiming to be a Christian herself a Christian Church all right now I want to skip down here remember on the first sermon we preached what was the requirement to recognize the Mystery Babylon anyone remember what's that spiritual gift Lydia wisdom wisdom that's right wisdom is the gift you have to have in order to not be deceived now one of them mentions this is why we're not a denomination he says how many knows that wisdom is one of the gifts of the Spirit now what kind of group then is he talking to where he says you might you need wisdom to recognize that the number of the beast right and you'd wisdom to recognize as she sits on seven hills but I said what kind of group is he talking to he must be talking to a group of people that has the gifts of the Spirit operating in the church amen huh Larry if we've got wisdom to know that it's role who sits on seven hills and let me tell you we've got the gifts of the Spirit operating in this church ain't matter I bowed and said it takes the gift of wisdom to recognize her he said now you stop find that all through these church ages here how those gifts to be working in the last day now we got gifts of healing working it's going good well brother there's other gifts oh brother have says people are emphasizing healing so much he said we got other gifts than that so we need a balance right we got to emphasize all nine the same way but remember wisdom gets a little bit higher emphasis because brother have said wisdom governs all other eight gifts right that's what he said he said see that just one of them that's just a little minor thing well here's a far greater gift here which would be the best road ram says the gift of Holy Ghost the wisdom to put the word together and the show of the church where we're standing or just somebody getting healed ain't had which is greater healed in your body or to know where you're standing in God's sight amen which is greater Burris and wisdom is the greater gift and they go for healings I thank God when people get healed we rejoice in that but Bernard said which is greater he said we all want to be well but I'd rather had my soul well than my body well anytime in that beautiful church and he says that in a number of places I don't have a mall in front of me I preached that years ago when I preached when te6 sermons on gifts of the Spirit back in 2012 looking through him today that's how I know because I was looking for different scriptures and quotes I can't remember all those but see it's so important and that's why the Holy Spirit said wisdom to know she sits on seven hills and John wonders with great admiration let me read one more from the first seal how many member brother BAM says this in the first in the first seal he said where this prostitute of revelation 17 she was the mystery Mystery Babylon the mother of harlots and John admired her now look wouldn't you I've talked to message people and they said they had they were amazed they've gone there and they've they've admired just the physical structure of things and we can do that as humans we could a mile out these men and women or whoever built it they did a fantastic job in our hearts we think if only this could be a real place of worship right and we admire that and so look but James look brother J or mother John looks at this and he admires it now the sad part is you can't see it from here but these are all statues of saints up here now that's where it's evil these are all statues of saints so they're surrounded by demons right that's basically they're saying they're surrounded by demons and idolatry so all those demons like those demons are looking down into them right there just surrounded by the demons thank God we're not surrounded by demons we're surrounded by angels amen because angels in camp though that fear of the Lord Amen but Berlin said John admired her look wait we get here and watch him watching this horse here see course horse she's talked about the first seal what happened was this he admired her with great admiration but the mystery who was she drank the blood of the martyrs of Christ as beautiful as she looked so John masa saw in this state but before this state she was drinking the blood of the martyrs he said a beautiful church set their programs I'm still quoting later have decked in purple and gold and she had a cup in her hand of the filthiness of her fornication what is fornications her unrighteous living that's that's the doctrine she was given out and I just did seven doctrines there's hundreds and I don't want to invest more time because I thought these are the major ones my Fenny buddy if anybody can't see these there's no light in you at all worship and marry and praying to dead people all kinds of trash calling the Pope Holy Father trash like that that's so sad alright Hail Marys all kinds of stuff now so the next the next proof and this is something I'm just gonna look up and I'm just pray the Lord gives me grace so the next in revelation 17:4 now here's what I put in my next book it's not out yet but it'll be out maybe next year the next proof is number seven the mother holiday is arrayed in purple and scarlet all's I did was type in Pope purple red and look at this church I'm not gonna scroll down because there you know with Google searches there may be things down there that are evil and immoral but I knew for sure the first page is okay because I checked I checked now the Catholic websites all say it's common to see priests are spaceships and the Pope frequently arrayed in these colors based upon annual festivals holy days and seasons of the church year you ever see Muslims dressed up like that they'll never see the Jewish well Jewish they only have a temple so you can't see them dressed up like that so there's another one the only one that fits is the mother harlot now let me read you here's the reasons they do it so green is they priests wear for mass as an ordinary time green symbolizes hope in life why is used for a number of feast days including the feasts of the Lord Mary and the Saints who are not martyrs and angels it's used during the scenes of Christmas and Easter symbolizes joy light and purity viola is used during the scenes of pettite penitence Advent and Lent also used for masses for the dead and that crave my goodness they're still trying to forgive sins after people die represents penance and morning sometimes blues used instead of violet to symbolize the penitential nature of Advent so that's the birth of Christ the advent of Christ and red represents the Holy Spirit suffering priests wear red vestments on Pentecost and confirmations but also on feasts of suffering such as Feast of the Lord's passion and peace the marks now why do I say all that because this is just that see they're just trying to impersonate what you've already got you've got one closing you're already wearing and it the white righteousness of Jesus Christ amen Jesus told the church age he said walk before me in white amen how do they up there just trying to impersonate this but we're already dressing right and we've got the real code doesn't matter what colors we have on now God's looking at the soul the soul of man must not be crimson red by sin it must be what the forgiveness of Christ see it's a promotion but who's wearing purple and scarlet children who's wearing that your dad doesn't wear that usually not every now and then but they wear it all year round and they got gold and your dad doesn't wear a gold crown I'll tell you that I will in heaven but now right now but even in heaven it just being for a short time because I'm gonna throw it at Jesus feet I could have earned this without you lord I just lay it right there but see they're hyper Alessa they're having their millennium right now but ours is later hey that's okay I'll take my later amen I'm passing the test right now I'm trying to get straight A's amen pass the test now the next one this one's striking too okay number eight the Bible said revelation 17:8 she's the wealthy church deck with gold precious stones and pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and the filthiness of her fornication now in 2015 after the Pope got elected he was on the cover of Time remember and on the cover he's holding these golden jewel covered I got a picture of my I don't have it there for you guys to see but I got it on my home computer and if you look on the inside all the pictures have gold and jewels all over it so all of their instruments and tools that they use are all gold and diamonds and jewels and all kinds of things like that but one thing I've never quite understood but I'm finally starting to get understanding of is how the Catholic Church is so wealthy I've always kind of struggle with this but I went to the Britannic and the Britannica says the Vatican receives freewill donations from more than 1 million Catholics worldwide they also earn interest on their financial investments which this is about will reduce in just a moment do they earn interest they invest in things and they have flocks of tourists and visitors to its museums galleries and libraries which hold priceless collections right maket Michelangelo's art Leonardo's art it's priceless you can't put a price tag on that now let's this article I just found this today I was thinking Lord just help me so I just typed in Vatican and money and it came up now this is from 2015 actually so here's five facts and look at this this was in 2015 it has eight billion dollars in assets now this is striking look at this church the Vatican Bank has about 8 million in assets and look it's this is CNN now this is the most liberal biased you source on earth and they're saying it's often the bank in Vatican the Vatican Bank is always at the center of scandals and corruption since it started in 1942 not sometimes always it's always at the center of all these financial scandals that's that Vatican Bank well why don't they shut it down because they can't because the Vatican's the boss and who can make war against that woman who's going to make war against that beast not the nation of Italy not that weak little government of Italy that big iron tooth beast is going to tell Italy what to do right Church now they say they're gonna clean it up that's nonsense they haven't cleaned it up according to Scripture now scripture says they won't clean it up now it says now here's here's how it gets its money they have they have thirty three thousand accounts but many of these are awarded to powerful Italian officials looking this - money without paying taxes so they'll make deals in their business and instead of putting in the bank and saving it investments because later when they want to get it back they've got to pay interest on it and taxes that take it out of the bank so they don't put it in the regular banks they put it in the Vatican Bank and they take their money and they give it brother William - they're kind no priest ah they take their money give it there because they put it under some false name well I can access this I'll just pay off the tellers I'll just pay this off and I can go get my money later and it'll make all this interest and I want to pay any taxes on it eight billion dollars in 2015 they close 4,000 accounts but I wonder how many got now right because the stock markets booming booming now this was just saying it has over 1.1 billion off its balance sheet so it kind of cleaned up I'm not going to spend much time on that one they ran out the Sistine Chapel so the Porsche the 40 Porsche group paid almost 6,000 just to have like a little meeting there so they ran it out kind of to make money look at thatmy and to make somebody a saint they had to raise over a quarter million dollars just to make somebody a saint and now Michael brother Graham said brother Graham said they said do you believe in the Saints and RAM said yes Saints are their Saints when they're alive I do believe in Saints while they're alive they're Saints cuz Paul wrote to the Saints that are in Ephesus and he wasn't writing to dead people he was writing to living people and then tourism is tripled and they make all kinds of money that 20 million visitors a year and they're all paying money to get on like one tour cost about $80 per person to go on one tour under it I think all the family members and think of all the money they're making there now let's revelation 18 now somehow this and this is what I'm waiting for for more understanding from the Holy Spirit and perhaps God will give it to me you know at some point but go to Revelation 18 11 the merchants of the earth so they have all this money they have all this money from Italian people maybe and maybe they have it from other people too but at least this article just says Italian officials maybe it's worldwide officials I don't know I imagine they would because it could maybe be all electronic but look at verse 11 after Babylon is destroyed of merchants of the earth weep and cry over the Roman Catholic Church that's that's what I just have a I have a little question about that I'd like to know more about that so I'd like to know how is the Vatican Bank connected to all the merchants now is it connected to Amazon brother how's it connected to Walmart and Target how is it that's what I want to know so I'm trusting the Holy Spirit will reveal that to me at some point who the verse 11 and the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her for no man buyeth their merchandise anymore so how is that possible how is all merchandise possible through the Vatican Bank or through the Vatican I don't know I don't have an answer for that that's why I liked how to answer for now look here's the merchandise verse 12 the merchandise of gold silver now we know where they have a lot of these metals they're in their possession precious stones of pearls fine linens and I are getting too close right linen clothes or sheets or blankets and purple and silk and scarlet and all thyine wood and all manner of vessels of ivory so even into ivory and all manner of most precious wood and brass iron and marble and cinnamon now you're getting into food products odors and ointments and frankincense and wine and oil now we know there's a lot of vineyards in in Italy they're known for their wine right they're known for their oils that the olive oils and everything out of the Italy it's very famous for that how is all that connected to the Vatican that's my question is it because all those people that own it do they all put their money in the Vatican Bank maybe maybe that seems like the best answer I have right now if anybody has any other information on that let me know so I can nail it down I want to put in this book before it comes out by God's grace so that anybody who's hungry can receive the Word of God yeah yeah might be right - yeah yeah at some point it will no kid Wow Wow I'd like to see that let's try to find some articles on that that'd be pretty powerful because I have to have an article to reference before I put in the book you know just cuz it gives you some validity but I believe that you know like let's say they're Catholic let's say they're Catholic then they would probably would tithe and give offerings based on their business and that'd be millions and millions of dollars that would be pretty striking but see they're crying after the Vatican's the story that means the bank is destroyed because remember everything the Vatican owns is right there in their little city they have a pharmacy an observatory they got their own everything from Bank they got their everything train system you know they got they got it it's just a city state that's one of our next proofs to look at so can everybody understand that by God's grace children is that helpful all right children okay let me just pull this picture back ups and everybody can just we'll just leave that as a visual I think that's my last one that one to show up I'll just leave it up there let me go a little bit longer here we go about 15 more minutes by God's grace number nine so we're going to 11 number nine the Catholic Church is drunken with the blood of the saints now I looked it up in the Britannica and it says Protestant historians this isn't a biased apparently unbiased source they said Protestant historians record medieval Roman Church practices in the most negative terms so proud like Luther's they look back at Catholic history and they say I can't say anything more negative about the Roman Catholic Church it's so evil I describe it in the most negative terms now what's sad is they don't even list it on the Britannica see they just kind of brush it over and say yeah they did some evil things but now they're a great Church nonsense yeah that's right and he said the Protestant historians recall the massive corruption of Catholic Church leaders including adultery's that are already documented by Pope's bribes extravagant papal art and architecture projects but they say worst of all is wars of conquest Wars the Pope's issued many Wars and killed millions of people and you know Samuel Schmucker wrote the glorious Reformation and wrote that 50 I'm sorry 68 million Christians were killed by the Roman Catholic Church because they dissented from her teachings and this was possible through the Catholic Inquisition and the Crusades because they they killed anyone they considered a heretic who would not bow to their teachings and this is the historic undeniable example of the Roman Church being drunk with the blood of the saints so John sees this beautiful building brothers but then he sees the woman drinking the blood of the saints yet so beautiful remember it can't be anyone else it has to be it has to be the Roman Church it can't be a Muslim it can't be Jew it's got to be a Christian Church a Mother Church it has to be Rome amen no one else even meets five of these requirements I think I'm sorry Jerusalem meets four I believe if I'm not mistaken all right the next one I touch on this earlier number 10 revelation seventeen eighteen said Mystery Babylon is that great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth now the VAT is the epitome of city state it's the epitome it's the very definition of church and state United it's this world's smallest fully independent nation state it operates tax-free in Italy has its own televisions I'm sorry telephone station or telephone system rather post office garden astronomical observatory radio station banking system pharmacy and it also has a contingent of Swiss Guards who are in charge of the personal safety of the Pope since 1506 they got their own guard system to protect the Pope thank God we got the guard system of the Holy Angels amen hallelujah now anyone who knows history knows that Pope's Pope the Pope's controlled church and state during the Dark Ages now it started there power started to wane around 16 and 17 1900 I found an article online and it says that in 1804 Napoleon Bonaparte was getting knighted but he did something totally unheard of instead of Ted letting the Pope put the crown on his head he walked up there and snatched the crown from the Pope and then he handed one to put one on his wife and he put one on himself and that was showing how the power was weakening the power of the Catholic Church over the state was weakening but it still had power over her but the physical power was coming to an end in fact I found this online - Pope John Paul the second he was Pope in the 70s and 80s and 90s if I remember him he is credited by the former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev as the one who helped end the Cold War between Russia and the US this this Russian Soviet leader now they're going to destroy them the cat the Vatican so this is totally crazy Rush's thus saith the Lord Russia's gonna drop a bomb and destroy the Vatican at one hour thus saith the Lord that's what my man said but the former leader said the Pope is responsible for breaking down these walls Mikhail Gorbachev see because they still exercise power over Kings robe and said they're not elected Kings I heard him say that today they're not elected Kings they're tyrants right and then we even know you know the voting system is all messed up anyway they might they might change the voting system it might be a Krupp voting system amen but I still vote anyway because I still want my voice to be heard I still want to be a witness in heaven at least tried to stop it with my preaching my voting my witnessing everything amen my voice I gave everything I could to go against that beast system brother have said we might not be able to stop it but our voices need to cry out against it and now a former Polish senator named injury's says porzinski said pope john paul ii was responsible for the downfall of communism Roux worldwide so people still today admit the Pope has worldwide influence over kings and so let me ask you when was the last time a Muslim leader caused the end of Wars they start wars right where was the last time a Jewish priest ended a war they don't because they're so small it can only be the Pope now anybody with brother ant like boba have said about the church in his book anyone with any light of God in them will see these things the brother man was talking about the book of life he said anyone who wants to understand the book of life he said just get my church book he said you understand it if there's any life in you at all hey why because the lie is the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit gives revelation it gives knowledge it gives understanding because it's one spirit a man the Holy Spirit hallelujah if you've got any Spirit of God anointing you at all you'll see these things because it'll point you to the word so see how this is a great city a great city it's a city state the only one like in the world ma who reigns over the kings of the earth and last but not least number eleven this church rides the Beast or the spirit of ancient Rome right because that's when the brother answer to the Beast is Rome he said the Beast is always Rome so the Beast is the spirit of ancient Rome now we know the symbolism symbolism in Daniel 7 in Daniel 7 babylons liken to a lion right Medes and Persians are likened to a bear I remember that picture the Grecians are like a leopard and then Rome is a dreadful terrible beast we're not taught what it looks like all we know it's got great iron teeth and their spirit beasts and Daniel 7 but the Holy Spirit John to look out in Revelation 13 and he sees a beast coming up that's a combination of all four of those beasts amen it's all the beasts rolled into one day men are there and sitting on her is a woman drinking the blood of the saints it has to be the Vatican amen hallelujah see it has to be and history says this I'm quoting although ancient Roman Empire fell in the 5th century it fell in the fifth century the ancient Roman Empire it gained new spiritual authority through the Emperor Constantine in the fourth century right after their counsels of Nicaea and other councils and how did he do that it happened this is actually history says when Constantine changed the Empire's capital from Rome to the city of Constantinople in 3:30 Rome's civil forty was weakened but it's spirits authority was strengthened because now the title of the supreme priest or Pontifex Maximus was now devolved upon the Pope amen so when he moved the location the capital it was now at the same place where the polis and now the Pope has the title Pontifex Maximus instead of the ruler of Rome because Constantine must have felt that this is going to fall this kingdoms gonna fall so he's going to give that title over to the Pope and he's sure to take that title run with it especially during the Dark Ages right specially during the Dark Ages so see this fulfilled Revelation 13 one two three because that beast was wounded to death but the deadly wound was healed when Constantine Mary R gave that authority from himself over to the Pope that's right the spirit of Rome lives on in this woman this city and just as the ancient Rome saw Kingdom our world dominance and saw global influence so the Roman Catholic Church does that today with religious power day ahead hallelujah praise the Lord so remember it's the same demons because demons don't die it's the same demons that were all Nebuchadnezzar and all of his buddies and Belshazzar the same demons that were on them on the Roman Catholic Church today because the Bible said she is the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird amen that's why they molest children amen that's why they murder babies that's why they do all these evil things they do that because they're filled with all evil demon powers that's right let me find something to close with here by God's grace wow there's so much here let me close this veneer I'll just close with this thought here about the USA I may mention this earlier but I want to just close with this here because we know the Roman Catholic Church is similar to a modern USA I think I preached us did I preach on JFK when you were here one time brother ray JFK did I preach were you here when I preached on that okay we showed how JFK brought in you know Catholicism the United States yeah big time now in Revelation 13 the Beast out of the sea is the same beast that is the beast out of the earth later on the same chapter it's the same beast but now he's not coming out of many peoples now he's coming out of land a smaller number of people which both Bram said was North America or the Native Americans so the beast out of the sea is the same beast that is the beast up out of the land this means the power of the Roman Spirit will be exercised by the beast out of the land which is the United States and there's great similarities between ancient Rome and the United States they both have the largest economies in the world right ancient Rome had the largest economy at that time in fact they got so stretched out that's why they fell history says the reason they stopped followers there were so much corruption in the government that they stopped paying the soldiers and so after you know after years and years this the soldiers only got paid from time to time they stopped being at their post of duty they just you know took it lightly and that allowed other nations to come in because now the soldiers aren't there at their posts of duty do you see how that's the other Congress was all corrupt in their Senate was I just like today my goodness mercy in the Lord okay yeah there are little oh they're concerned about is them getting raises right the continent now most of them not all of them the congressmen and representives they just want to make sure if they don't pass any bill you know they're gonna pass the bill to get a pay raise to get their own pay raise all not yeah they sure earned that Devils reward just like Judas earn is reward right right they'll make sure they vote to get their pay raise they won't vote on you know funding this or funding that but they'll make sure they get a raise Rome and us also have the strongest military number three they had the most 100 and respected politics in the world everybody looked at Rome and said my look at their politics we need to have a republic like that same thing about United States everybody sees the freedom in the u.s. everybody sees the legislative process and were the were the shining beacon for everyone also they had the most advanced technologies everyone knows the advances of Roman civilization right especially with roads that was one of the biggest ones because every road leads to Rome I'm sorry there's one that leads to heaven that's the one I've all and praise God I'm on the highway of holiness that road doesn't lead to Rome amen it leads to heaven and also Rome ancient Rome had the most freedom and variety of cultural expressions because of all their gods and goddesses and all their festivals just like America right you got the freedom to do about whatever you want freedom to pierce your nose and make yourself look like a Beatle if you want or a lizard with everyone you got the freedom to do that but thank God we got the freedom to worship Jesus Christ hey man thank God for that yeah lastly is religious tolerance which we kind of overlap that a little bit now let's just go for a little bit of history a little bit more now brother branham interprets this well I just let's see here there's so much to get into let's just let's just go to one more scripture let's go to Revelation 13 here I'm just gonna close I'm gonna I'm gonna just and change one thing let's go to Revelation 13 6 I'm gonna close with a triple blasphemy thought here let me just close with that I thought this won't be shorter but it's actually longer the American thoughts are the longer this shot thoughts are those shorter triple blast me this beast blasphemes out of this spirit of Rome blasphemes God in three ways but brother Branham says this in this in the seals when he preached the seals is a three-fold blasphemy revelation 13:6 and he opened his mouth and blasphemy against God who's he that Antichrist spirit the beast Rome against God to blaspheme his name his tabernacle and then there in heaven brother Bram calls it triple blasphemy first how does he blaspheme God's name he changes it from Lord Jesus Christ to Holy Trinity or he'll put titles Father Son Holy Ghost how does he how do they bless every wedding and father son Holy Ghost instead of Lord Jesus Christ but the bottles Colossians 3:17 we do all things and word or deed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Philippians 2 not I'm sorry flip Ian's to 9 through 11 says there's no other name under heaven I'm sorry says Jesus Christ is the name of above all names amen in Ephesians 4 says there's the entire name of the family in heaven earth is the Lord Jesus Christ see the Roman Church doesn't hollow or reveal God's name Jesus taught us to pray and he said our Father who art in heaven hallowed be your name and so they break the first prayer they break the command the first command is let God's name be reverent they don't reverence the name of Lord Jesus Christ they reverence Holy Mother of God Holy Trinity and father son Holy Ghost more than that and they blaspheme the name of Jesus Christ but we don't blaspheme it we worship it we're married into it we run into it the righteous run into it and are saying they may we pray over our food in the name of Jesus Christ we pray over the sick in the name of Jesus Christ we baptize in the name of Jesus Christ amen but they blaspheme it not hallowing the name of Jesus Christ hallowed be your name because remember jesus said i come in my father's name the lord jesus christ second they blast me in heaven because they call Rome the Eternal City and we know it's not eternal on an area and they deck it with priceless artwork gold and precious valuables of incalculable measure Rome is not eternal for her plagues come in one day and she'll be judged in one hour amen because strong is the Lord God who judges her amen glory there's only one eternal City and that's the one that comes down from heaven the New Jerusalem in Revelation 21 and 22 and she comes down a door like a bride adorned for her husband hey man that heavenly tournament amen there's one eternal City that's your city hey men the New Jerusalem that's our city by God's grace praise God and let me just turn there where that scripture says that yeah it's verse 8 revelation 18 21 I read this a couple weeks ago right brother Aaron when we preach part 1 I think we ended that service by showing how the mother harlot can't be Jerusalem because Jerusalem gets resurrected right in Isaiah 65 and 66 and the Bible said she'll always be there but Rome gets destroyed and she'll have an ending point amen but Jerusalem will have a we'll never have an ending point because he's eternal amen yeah it's revelation 18 21 and a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast in the sea say thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down and shall be found no more at all Amen see wrong has an ending but New Jerusalem never has an ending amen and they clearly were eternal were - no that's not eternal that's idolatry that will have an ending with the pyramid city will have no ending and there's a place there there's a mansion there there's a hole there for you and I man that's why Jesus went away I go to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also amen there's one thing Jesus asked for in his prayer with the father he asked for your fellowship for all eternity program says that that's the one thing as for Lord make them one as we are one that where I am there they may be also amen he wanted to be with his wife forever so he went to prepare a place for her let's say in our feet here's last one the Bible that spear of Rome blasphemes then there are evident so Rome blasting the saints in heaven by teaching his followers to pray to them rather to God Himself can you imagine just getting all saying Peter help me Peter help me like what could Peter do like what what could he do what could Mary do every way what can these people do they can't do anything but they're taught that they that they're almost like gods you know and it's idolatry and it's a blasphemy Jesus Christ never taught anyone to pray to Mary or any other believer and I like acts 14 because any true believer whether alive or dead or alive in the other dimension would instantly reject any prayers sacrifice or worship directed to themselves just as Paul Barnabas did in acts 14 amen all got so filled with the holy spirit he saw a man that had never walked and he was crippled on his feet and the Bible said he said with a loud voice stand upright on your feet is because he had in the anointing of the gift of faith he had faith he had a revelation this man's going to walk how to get it by a vision from God Almighty Haven Isaiah and he's the Bible said he perceived that that man had faith in that preacher Amen so one omnipotent meant another unlimited Amen in other words one who's annoyed with the Holy Spirit another person who was anointed holy spirit and something's going to happen when two people ignored do it the Holy Spirit meet together amen in other words God has to work on both ends he worked on the end of the who never walked and he worked on pause can you imagine what in the hospital and basically foretelling you're going to rise up and walk right now you never will it before but you're gonna walk right now that's the kind of church that were a part of although we may have never have done it there are those around us who have done it praise God and it's part of our family tree amen holiday up and that same powers in us when God wants to use it that way glory see and whether the instant they said let's let's worship Paul and Barnabas they're like Jupiter and Saturn and instantly they got on their knees and they I don't worship both don't make any sacrifices to us we we can do nothing this was all done by God amen see any true man of God any true woman of God will instantly reject any worship or sacrifice made to them like Peter corneas when tonic kisses feast and get up man come on guy what are you doing man you can't worship me Who am I God sent me here my vision well I didn't have that power I was just up there praying at the sixth hour you know I was up there praying in my regular prayer time I didn't do this go do this amen but as he preached the Holy Ghost fell and all them that heard the word yes that's right so our lesson is that human beings are never honored with sacrifice prayers or worship that's reserved for God amen okay another pulpit here I'm sorry come to the piano now Lord willing we'll finish next Wednesday if the Lord tarries will look at the mark of the beast the mark in the right hand or forehead the mark of his name these are all different things we can look at the number again if you look at that or the image of the beast some of these are
