[42:42] died the righteous for the unrighteous
[42:44] we ask that you speak to us today
[42:46] through your word Lord God used me I'm
[42:48] just a nobody a vessel of clay Lord just
[42:52] used me for thy purpose bless every
[42:54] heart may the ears be hungry and ready
[42:57] to hear Lord and help me as well Lord
[42:59] God to be hungry and thirsting for more
[43:01] of righteousness help us all or do a
[43:03] supernatural work this morning dear God
[43:05] for thy glory for we need to hear your
[43:08] voice Oh God and it will immediately put
[43:10] us in the spirit when we hear your voice
[43:12] so we're grateful Lord and father we
[43:14] give you all the glory honor and praise
[43:16] this morning in Jesus Christ's name and
[43:18] the Saint said Amen god bless should be
[43:20] in seated praise the Lord
[43:29] well it's good to be with you in the
[43:30] house of Lord and I was looking for the
[43:32] Lord to bless us here in His divine
[43:35] presence as we said we're going to look
[43:38] at the four and twenty elders this
[43:40] morning and then tonight we'll look a
[43:41] little bit further at em we'll look at
[43:43] you know Reuben all the way down to
[43:44] Benjamin we'll look at them this evening
[43:47] by the grace of the Lord at four o'clock
[43:49] so I've been enjoying this those series
[43:53] here and I just been listening over and
[43:55] over and over to the Prophet preached
[43:57] these sermons you know from 1961 and the
[44:02] inspiration from this message of course
[44:03] comes from the the new year's service on
[44:06] Sunday morning and it was January 1st
[44:10] 1961 so I keep missing that that's part
[44:12] two of his series on Revelation chapter
[44:15] four so a lot of my inspiration is
[44:16] coming from that message this morning if
[44:19] you like to listen to it yourselves or
[44:21] or however you like to do it okay so our
[44:24] text was verse four and then I read 10
[44:26] and 11 to kind of give us a little bit
[44:28] more of an insight on these four and
[44:31] twenty elders now the first thought
[44:33] which is I'm going to spend most
[44:35] probably the entire service on this
[44:36] thought is that the Prophet said where
[44:39] the Bible speaks I saw four and twenty
[44:42] elders sitting and I think I'll probably
[44:45] just spend this whole sermon on these
[44:47] three thoughts the Prophet takes the
[44:50] rest of the service he finishes this
[44:52] service with this thought right here
[44:54] that the twenty-four elders are not
[44:56] angels then he defines an elder and then
[45:00] his third point he kind of ends the
[45:02] sermon with his elders rule in the
[45:04] future Kingdom so that's what those are
[45:07] the revelations that the Prophet teaches
[45:08] there through this sermon so I trust
[45:11] it'll be a blessing to you I'm gonna set
[45:13] my timer all right we can begin here so
[45:17] the first thought is the 24 elders are
[45:19] not angels these are quotes from that
[45:21] sermon the Prophet said I want you to
[45:23] notice they're not angelic beings angels
[45:25] are not associated heavenly beings are
[45:28] not associated with crowns and Thrones
[45:31] see they never associated their angels
[45:34] they never did overcome which is
[45:36] interesting because
[45:37] we know they didn't fall to Lucifer's
[45:39] Church split in the beginning so they
[45:42] were able to overcome that but it's not
[45:45] the same kind of overcoming as you and I
[45:47] must do it's a different kind of
[45:49] overcoming because we were fallen beings
[45:52] and they were unfallen right they were
[45:54] the Bible said they were in their first
[45:56] estate right they left not their first
[46:00] estate but we had fallen many of us or
[46:02] all of us except Adam and he basically
[46:04] were born in sin right except for Adam
[46:07] and Eve all of us were born in sin
[46:10] shaped and iniquity come to the world
[46:11] speaking lies but angels were in their
[46:14] first estate and so they never had to
[46:16] overcome like you and I am said if you
[46:20] notice a little a later on the songs
[46:21] that they sang the things they did prove
[46:23] that they wasn't they sung the song of
[46:26] redemption so angels don't need to be
[46:28] redeemed alright they were redeemed men
[46:31] now I'm not gonna read all these but if
[46:34] you want to write them down if you want
[46:35] to study on the word he basically took
[46:37] the word Redemption and traced it
[46:39] through the concordance he said if you
[46:42] want to take some he said digna a
[46:44] Matthew 19:28 revelation 3:21 revelation
[46:48] 20 verse 4 revelation 2:10 1st Peter 5 2
[46:51] and 4 2nd Timothy 4:8 that will let you
[46:54] know they were redeemed I want to go
[46:57] through that this morning you see and
[46:58] you could just comb it for weeks you see
[47:02] so brother Brandon of course just
[47:05] hitting the highlights because brother
[47:08] Branham and I could do the same thing
[47:09] this morning I coulda took each of these
[47:10] scriptures and preached them and then we
[47:12] could have spent one service on just
[47:13] that quote right there because those are
[47:16] all scriptures that back up that the
[47:18] only people that are redeemed are
[47:20] blood-bought Saints right fallen human
[47:23] beings who are brought back by the blood
[47:26] of Jesus and the Bible says regenerated
[47:28] by the Holy Ghost amen
[47:31] regenerated amen reom powered right
[47:35] anointed for the purpose of God now I
[47:38] want to point out brother man makes this
[47:40] statement next and program gives us a
[47:45] rule for rightly dividing the word of
[47:47] God not interesting this is a prophet
[47:49] and he tells us this is how
[47:51] you rightly divide the word of God he
[47:53] said you must consider every detail in
[47:56] the scripture so before you make a
[47:59] determination you've got to really read
[48:00] over a portion of Scripture and he said
[48:03] you've got to point out and consider
[48:04] every detail so let's look at this quote
[48:07] he said they were not angelic beings
[48:09] they were not heavenly beings they were
[48:11] redeemed men he said see you can
[48:14] consider their dress the way they were
[48:18] dressed you can consider their position
[48:21] what they had you consider the songs
[48:24] what they saying and know that they were
[48:28] not angelic beings hmm so brother Han
[48:32] said this is how you interpret the Word
[48:34] of God you've got to look at more than
[48:36] just one little thought in the scripture
[48:38] you've got to consider everything the
[48:39] Bible says and then when you have that
[48:42] when you consider all that you've got to
[48:44] let the Holy Spirit guide you to
[48:46] scriptures to show you what the truth of
[48:48] the matter is and so that's what the
[48:50] Prophet did there's churches that teach
[48:53] the outers were angels these 24 elders
[48:55] there are angels in brother Graham's
[48:57] kind of hammering and said they didn't
[48:59] consider all these other things we've
[49:01] got to consider all the Word of God amen
[49:05] like you know my friend recently here my
[49:07] friend and I disagreed on women
[49:09] preachers and I said well there is no
[49:10] woman preacher and he said what about
[49:12] Deborah and what about all these I said
[49:14] there's they're not preachers they're
[49:15] just prophesying and so I was basically
[49:19] sharing with him I said you if you go in
[49:21] the New Testament Jesus never called a
[49:23] woman to be an apostle paul said i don't
[49:26] paul said i never allow a woman to have
[49:29] authority above a man and so I'm
[49:32] basically telling him you need to
[49:34] consider all these other scriptures you
[49:37] have to consider the whole witness of
[49:39] the scripture and so because the Bible
[49:42] says you know that a woman can prophesy
[49:45] but the Bible says are all prophets and
[49:47] of course know and prophesying is
[49:50] different than preaching prophesying is
[49:52] foretelling the future preaching is
[49:54] teaching the Word of God
[49:56] it's declaring the Word of God having
[49:58] authority in a congregation of believers
[50:01] it's different from prophesy prophesying
[50:04] can be done any
[50:05] where anyplace but in a gathering of
[50:07] saints there's a man who has the
[50:08] authority led by the Holy Spirit and he
[50:11] he's having authority over the people
[50:14] because it's not his authority he
[50:16] doesn't rule by his thoughts he rules by
[50:18] the word amen
[50:20] and so I was sharing with my friend
[50:22] you've got to consider this and consider
[50:23] that I was praying for him this morning
[50:25] that God would open his heart so buh-bam
[50:28] tells us this is how you rightly divide
[50:30] the word you must consider every detail
[50:33] now look at the details brother Graham
[50:35] points out I just highlighted them in
[50:36] both their seats they're sitting on
[50:39] Thrones and their crowns of gold so I
[50:42] just pointed those out to you you have
[50:44] to look at every detail that's
[50:46] describing some group or individual
[50:49] before you make a determination about
[50:52] which group it is amen
[50:55] now if we jump ahead to chapter 5 though
[50:57] the Bible said that they take the book
[50:59] and the four beasts and the four and
[51:01] twenty elders fell down before the lamb
[51:03] having every one of them harps and
[51:05] golden vials full of odours which are
[51:07] the prayers of the saints
[51:09] and they sent a new song saying thou art
[51:12] worthy to take the book and to open the
[51:14] seals thereof for thou was slain and has
[51:16] redeemed us here's the 24 elders saying
[51:19] we were redeemed we were bought by the
[51:22] blood the blood purchased sinners the
[51:26] blood didn't purchase angels the angels
[51:28] were already created right but the blood
[51:30] had to purchase you and I we were
[51:32] strangers and as Gentiles we were active
[51:35] we were actually foreigners to the will
[51:36] of God we were without hope without God
[51:39] lost we were strangers of the promises
[51:42] but the blood brought us near to God
[51:44] amen glory we were aliens we had nothing
[51:48] to do with Jews there were no connection
[51:49] to God but the blood of Jesus Christ
[51:51] brought us back amen
[51:53] redeemed us to God hallelujah now I want
[51:56] to inject this thought here because this
[51:59] is a thought that some people wonder
[52:00] about we must consider every detail on
[52:04] the gentile group from revelation 7:9
[52:06] through 17 is this the wise virgin or
[52:10] the foolish virgin now just so you know
[52:13] brother Branham gives four quotes on it
[52:16] that I can find there could be more I
[52:18] could be
[52:18] I could be in need of finding more
[52:20] quotes but three of the quotes say it
[52:23] was the wise virgin and one quote sent
[52:26] the foolish virgin and I had somebody
[52:29] email me from Africa and they said how
[52:31] can you teach it I believe it's the wise
[52:33] virgins you teach it was the foolish
[52:36] virgin because brother Graham in the
[52:38] seven seals said it's the it's the I'm
[52:41] sorry how could you teach us the wise
[52:43] virgin because brother Brahim said in
[52:44] the seven seals
[52:45] it was the foolish and I said I just
[52:48] tried to humbly say well because there's
[52:50] three quotes that say it was the wise
[52:52] and threes more than one and there's
[52:55] twice after there's twice after the
[52:58] seventh seal where brother ham said it
[53:00] is the wise version so if he says
[53:02] something here then twice as in later
[53:04] afterwards I just tend to go with that
[53:06] thought so let's go through those the
[53:10] first time I can find it is in 1960
[53:12] right during the church ages series
[53:16] wrote and said if you want to see the
[53:19] bride come up after that the 144,000 so
[53:22] after the hundred forty-four thousand
[53:23] the bride will come up just continue to
[53:26] read on down now in the seventh chapter
[53:29] and then he reads about what we're gonna
[53:32] read in just a moment he says what does
[53:34] your wife do she serves you in the house
[53:37] you sit down she gives you your food she
[53:39] fixes the clothing she serves you day
[53:41] and night in the house and this one
[53:43] these of all nations the Gentiles which
[53:46] is the bride are before the throne of
[53:49] God with him day and night I'll remember
[53:52] what we said last night and talked on it
[53:55] amen aren't you glad church that every
[53:57] day of your life you get to serve Christ
[53:59] on this earth a lot of church members
[54:02] will serve them on Sunday or if they
[54:03] have a special fundraiser they'll serve
[54:05] that day but then they'll live and send
[54:07] the rest of the week but you and I we
[54:09] serve him every single day
[54:10] we don't take a day off and because we
[54:12] serve Him every day here we'll serve Him
[54:14] in heaven amen
[54:15] because awhile real genuine life doesn't
[54:18] take a day off she does good to her
[54:20] husband all the days of her life amen
[54:22] now we're jumping ahead now to after the
[54:26] church a after the seven seals to this
[54:28] message on questions and answers in 64
[54:32] - brother branham will the prophet of
[54:35] Malachi 4 be the one to call off the
[54:36] Gentile remnant of revelation 7:9 even
[54:39] though they go through the tribulation
[54:40] period brother Brandon corrects them
[54:41] this is after the the seals he says no
[54:44] no no revelation 7 is where he's seen
[54:47] 144,000 sealed and after that he saw
[54:49] coming up coming back was that great
[54:52] number which no man could number which
[54:53] was the bride so there's the second
[54:57] quote where the Prophet says revelation
[54:59] 7:9 214 is the Bride of Christ not the
[55:03] foolish virgin here is the third and
[55:06] final one that I found brother Branham
[55:09] reads revelation 70 says God is talking
[55:11] about the bride here you want to see
[55:13] another picture of her it's over in
[55:14] Revelation 7 4 through 17 and he reads
[55:18] the text which we'll read in just a
[55:20] moment now here's the only quote where
[55:22] the Prophet said it was the foolish
[55:23] virgin so we remember it's 3 verse 1
[55:27] which is okay you know either it could
[55:29] be more out there but right now it looks
[55:30] like 3 verse 1 the Prophet said the
[55:33] first thing was that the sleeping virgin
[55:35] had to go through the tribulation period
[55:36] for purification she had to be purged of
[55:39] her sins of unbelief and rejecting the
[55:40] message this she was done in the
[55:43] tribulation period we see they wind up
[55:46] over here revelation 7 between the 6 and
[55:49] 7 chapter now that she had been purged
[55:51] and she'd been given her robes now let's
[55:55] do it the brother Han just said let's
[55:56] consider every scripture in revelation 7
[55:59] 9 to 14 so you don't have to get your
[56:02] Bibles if you want to you can but I just
[56:04] decided to put it up here might be a
[56:05] little easier for you to follow along so
[56:08] this is the text some people say oh this
[56:09] is the foolish virgin I believe it's the
[56:12] wise virgins it's the bride and I have a
[56:14] three scriptural proofs for that but
[56:18] member we have to consider every detail
[56:19] how many want to consider every detail
[56:21] in the Word of God and after this I
[56:23] beheld and lo a great multitude which no
[56:25] man could number of all nations and
[56:26] Kindred's and people and tongues stood
[56:28] before the throne and before the lamb
[56:30] clothed with white robes and palms in
[56:32] their hands and cry with a loud voice
[56:35] saying salvation to our God which
[56:36] sitteth upon the throne and unto the
[56:39] lamb now we get the first clue because
[56:44] of the white the washed robes they
[56:46] already
[56:47] have wash robes can everybody see that
[56:49] this group is without number there from
[56:52] every nation there's black there there's
[56:54] white there's yellow every nation there
[56:56] they got palms and they're worshiping
[56:58] God and praising Jesus and they've
[57:00] already got their robes can everybody
[57:03] see that and one of the elders answer is
[57:07] send to me so one of the outers one of
[57:08] the 24 elders I wonder which one it was
[57:10] was it Peter who was it John was it John
[57:13] was it Ruben was a Benjamin was the
[57:14] Judah one of the outers said which are
[57:18] they which I'm sorry what are these
[57:20] which are arrayed in white robes and
[57:21] whence came they and I sent them Sir
[57:24] thou knowest and he said to me these are
[57:26] they which came out of Great Tribulation
[57:28] and have washed their robes and made
[57:32] them white in the blood of the Lamb now
[57:34] the first point I'm sorry the one thing
[57:36] you need to know is that Oh some people
[57:38] say see it says tribulation so so that
[57:40] can't be the bride but you've got to
[57:42] consider every scripture in the Bible
[57:45] the Bible said all the saints go through
[57:47] tribulation and you can read that in
[57:50] acts 14:22 Romans 5:3 second Corinthians
[57:53] one for first Estonian 3:32 for second
[57:55] Timothy 3:12 says that all that live
[57:57] godly in christ shall suffer persecution
[58:01] so see it's what we got to understand
[58:04] all the Word of God so the first point
[58:08] that proves this is not the foolish
[58:09] virgin is that the foolish virgin would
[58:13] not have their white robes yet and you
[58:16] say prove that to me sure it's in the
[58:18] fifth seal because remember their souls
[58:20] under the altar and the fifth seal
[58:22] they're Jews and they're crying how long
[58:23] how long and the Bible said they don't
[58:25] have white robes yet because they're
[58:27] asking for revenge
[58:29] when will you avenge our blood 1 and the
[58:32] Bible said after that then white robes
[58:34] were given unto them so they do not have
[58:37] eternal life yet in other words the Jews
[58:39] cannot be born again because they're
[58:41] blind to Jesus Christ as the Messiah so
[58:44] they can't be baptized with the Holy
[58:45] Ghost because brother Graham tells us
[58:49] this now listen it is the second
[58:50] resurrection so not the rapture it's the
[58:53] white throne judgment that the souls
[58:55] under the altar are set forth in the
[58:57] fifth seal are given white robes and of
[59:00] course eternal life or the
[59:01] else there would be no point of white
[59:02] robes so see these in Revelation 7 I
[59:08] believe it's the wise diversion because
[59:09] they've already gotten their white robes
[59:11] the wise virgin the Jews and the foolish
[59:15] virgin won't have white robes until the
[59:17] white throne judgment brother Branham
[59:19] says it again he says there's another
[59:21] class their names are also in the book
[59:23] of life and they come up in the second
[59:24] resurrection such are the foolish
[59:26] virgins and the righteous as our spoken
[59:29] of in Matthew 25 in this class also are
[59:31] those who do not worship the Beast or
[59:33] become involved in the Antichrist system
[59:35] but die for their faith even though they
[59:37] were not in the bride not having been
[59:39] born again but they will come up in the
[59:41] second resurrection and go into eternal
[59:44] life amen to further clarify no
[59:47] specifically the words of Matthew 25 it
[59:50] does not say that a shepherd is
[59:52] literally separating sheep from goats
[59:53] but it is as a shepherd dividing sheep
[59:57] from goats so charge do you see the only
[1:00:00] real sheep the only true sheep of God
[1:00:02] are those who are born again today amen
[1:00:05] foolish virgin will meant to be safe but
[1:00:08] they're not true sheep because they're
[1:00:11] not truly born again they hear all
[1:00:13] different kinds of voices they follow
[1:00:15] all kinds of different voices and all
[1:00:17] kinds of different ideas in their life
[1:00:19] because they're foolish to the Holy
[1:00:21] Ghost they follow they want to they want
[1:00:23] to dabble a little bit with the world
[1:00:24] and they still want to have a church
[1:00:27] membership and that's why Jesus calls
[1:00:29] them foolish but a real wise Christian
[1:00:31] once the baptism of the Holy Ghost more
[1:00:33] than anything else and they will stop
[1:00:35] until they got it that's what makes them
[1:00:37] wise amen
[1:00:38] they forsake everything of the world
[1:00:40] anything foolish and make sure they are
[1:00:42] born again amen yes so that's a true
[1:00:47] sheep of God
[1:00:48] you're so humble you'll follow Jesus all
[1:00:50] the way to your own death and
[1:00:51] resurrection and redemption and baptism
[1:00:53] of the Holy Ghost that's right he says
[1:00:58] these are not sheep in this particular
[1:00:59] area of time the white throne judgment
[1:01:01] the Sheep err in his fold they heard his
[1:01:03] voice the word and they found him they
[1:01:05] have already have eternal life and
[1:01:07] cannot come into judgment but these do
[1:01:09] not have eternal life and they are in
[1:01:11] the judgment they are allowed to go into
[1:01:13] eternal life
[1:01:15] now upon what grounds do they enter into
[1:01:18] life eternal
[1:01:19] certainly not upon the fact that they
[1:01:21] already have his life as does the bride
[1:01:22] but they receive it because they were
[1:01:24] kind to his brethren they are not his
[1:01:27] brethren that would make them join heirs
[1:01:30] with Jesus they are not heirs to
[1:01:32] anything but life they share no throne
[1:01:36] etc with him their names must have been
[1:01:38] in the book of life and not removed now
[1:01:41] because of their love for the people of
[1:01:43] God they're recognized and saved no
[1:01:45] doubt they served and help the children
[1:01:47] of God perhaps like Nicodemus and gamaya
[1:01:50] they stood for the children in a time of
[1:01:53] trouble amen and that beautiful
[1:01:55] so the foolish version the only thing
[1:01:57] she inherits is eternal life the only
[1:02:01] thing she inherits is a white robe and
[1:02:03] the church said now let me bring it down
[1:02:06] here to nail it in now this is where
[1:02:08] it's gonna nail it down these are the
[1:02:10] last two points so the first one is they
[1:02:14] have white robes and that that means
[1:02:17] they already have eternal life they were
[1:02:18] already born to get on earth and now
[1:02:20] that they're in heaven now they've got a
[1:02:22] white robe because they're already born
[1:02:23] again the second point is who serves the
[1:02:26] husband but the wife because they serve
[1:02:28] and the Bible said therefore are they
[1:02:31] before the throne of God and serve Him
[1:02:33] day and night in his temple and he the
[1:02:37] sitteth on the throne shall dwell among
[1:02:40] them they shall hunger no more neither
[1:02:42] thirst any more neither shall the Sun
[1:02:45] light on them nor any Heat so the first
[1:02:49] point is that the the wise version she
[1:02:52] is the true wife of Christ and because
[1:02:54] she served him here on earth now shall
[1:02:57] serve him eternally in his presence
[1:02:59] that's right and third to me this is the
[1:03:02] most powerful one they are now notice in
[1:03:06] this scripture they are in his temple
[1:03:09] they're in a temple can everybody say
[1:03:11] amen to that remember brother I said
[1:03:13] consider where they are consider what
[1:03:15] they're wearing
[1:03:16] considering what they're saying consider
[1:03:18] everything about them and if you do that
[1:03:20] the Holy Ghost will teach you the truth
[1:03:22] amen so they're in his temple now I'm
[1:03:26] going to just jump past this brother BAM
[1:03:28] goes that
[1:03:29] Daniel 7 and shows how the Saints there
[1:03:32] there was a thousand st. thousand
[1:03:34] thousands ministered unto him and ten
[1:03:36] thousand ten times ten thousand stood
[1:03:38] before him the judgment was set in the
[1:03:40] book were open the Prophet says see it
[1:03:42] is the same scene for the thousand
[1:03:44] thousands who are ministering to him are
[1:03:46] the bride for who ministers to the
[1:03:48] husband but the wife Amen so they
[1:03:53] already have white robes which means
[1:03:55] they're already born again on earth
[1:03:57] second they serve God daily day and
[1:04:00] night so it has to be the life and third
[1:04:04] they are in his temple and I notice this
[1:04:06] is my note she's worshiping in the
[1:04:09] temple the foolish virgin do not live
[1:04:12] the Bible said they live not again until
[1:04:15] the white throne judgment and after that
[1:04:17] there is no more temple for the lamb is
[1:04:20] the temple in the New Jerusalem amen not
[1:04:23] to me that's the nail in the coffin
[1:04:25] right never for the other belief not
[1:04:27] that I want to kill any believer but I
[1:04:29] just don't think it's the truth because
[1:04:31] the Bible said in the New Jerusalem I
[1:04:33] saw no temple right I saw no temple for
[1:04:37] the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are
[1:04:39] the temple of it so these in Revelation
[1:04:42] 7 are in the temple with white robes
[1:04:45] serving God right by the throne the
[1:04:48] whole time to me that's got to be the
[1:04:50] wise virgin that's got to be his bride
[1:04:52] some people might say different but as
[1:04:54] always I'm open to correction I just
[1:04:57] like to see some scriptures they men and
[1:04:58] some something else to to disprove this
[1:05:01] wonderful truth that I believe that
[1:05:03] brother Branham said three times to give
[1:05:05] us the truth on that praise the Lord
[1:05:08] now this is just a moment but we just
[1:05:10] have a few moments on this thought
[1:05:11] brother Ram defines the elders he says
[1:05:13] what does an elder mean if you take the
[1:05:15] word elder he said I got all these
[1:05:17] definitions elder means the head of a
[1:05:20] city or the head of a tribe and elders a
[1:05:23] head of something like brother Nevel
[1:05:25] right now is the elder to this church
[1:05:28] what is he he's the head of the local
[1:05:30] body see the mayor of the city would be
[1:05:33] the elder of this city see the outer of
[1:05:35] the cities you remember back in the
[1:05:36] Bible times the elders of the city elder
[1:05:38] means the head of a city or the head of
[1:05:39] a tribe now brother Branham in the
[1:05:42] church age book
[1:05:43] tells us that elder is the same as a
[1:05:46] pastor which is the same as a bishop
[1:05:48] which is the same as an overseer this is
[1:05:50] why people get screwed up on positions
[1:05:53] right this is why the denominations get
[1:05:56] mixed up on call people they call women
[1:05:58] elders and they call bishops something
[1:06:01] different than a pastor but the word
[1:06:03] elder in the Bible and Bishop actually
[1:06:05] referred to the self same person it's
[1:06:08] the pastor of the local assembly Butler
[1:06:11] have said these bishops in the days of
[1:06:12] Paul they insisted that Paul had given
[1:06:15] the meaning that overseers were more
[1:06:17] than the local elder but they weren't
[1:06:20] overseers were bishops with official
[1:06:26] capacity only in his own church so a
[1:06:29] real local elder only has authority in
[1:06:31] the local church to them a bishop was
[1:06:34] now one with extended authority over
[1:06:37] many local leaders so see we can't make
[1:06:40] a bishop to have authority over anything
[1:06:42] outside a local church a bishop or
[1:06:46] overseer or elder has authority in one
[1:06:49] place and that's in the local church
[1:06:51] does everyone understand that
[1:06:52] I have no jurisdiction over any other
[1:06:55] Church other than this one right here I
[1:06:57] have no influence I know I have no
[1:07:00] authority over any other Church than
[1:07:03] right here because God has set me here
[1:07:05] as the local elder as the pastor the
[1:07:08] bishop our overseer
[1:07:09] that's what the scripture teaches here
[1:07:11] that's what brother Branham teaches as
[1:07:12] well so brother Branham had to teach
[1:07:15] this there's 24 elders and so these
[1:07:18] elders were all overseers it could have
[1:07:22] been in case of the sons of Jacob it was
[1:07:24] 12 sons of Jacob they were heads of
[1:07:26] tribes amen now but the 12 apostles of
[1:07:31] course were were bishops we know that
[1:07:33] now next this is the thought I'll
[1:07:35] probably spend the rest of the service
[1:07:37] on so about four to give me 40 more
[1:07:38] minutes by the grace of the Lord brother
[1:07:42] Branham ends this sermon his main
[1:07:44] thought is that elders will rule in the
[1:07:47] future Kingdom because these 24 elders
[1:07:49] are seated on Thrones and he says this
[1:07:53] he says how many was there there was 20
[1:07:56] and 4 is that
[1:07:57] oh my who was it it was the 12 apostles
[1:08:00] and the 12 tribes of Israel
[1:08:03] the 12 patriarchs now we're going to
[1:08:06] take you right down to become in the
[1:08:07] other lessons and prove that to be right
[1:08:09] I'm glad you're writing it down the 12
[1:08:11] patriarchs and the 12 tribes of Israel
[1:08:13] now watch Jesus said that okay I don't
[1:08:16] think there's any doubt in our minds as
[1:08:18] to who these 24 elders are but brother
[1:08:20] Branham had to teach his congregation
[1:08:21] it's the twelve sons of Jacob and it's
[1:08:24] the twelve apostles of Christ of course
[1:08:26] we know what Judas brought out and we
[1:08:28] believe st. Paul brought in we believe
[1:08:30] that now brother Branham teaches on this
[1:08:34] he said Peter asked Jesus one day what
[1:08:37] will we receive we have left father
[1:08:40] mother husband wife children everything
[1:08:42] else we've left everything Peter says
[1:08:45] we've left our wives our children our
[1:08:48] father mother home's lands to follow you
[1:08:50] and Jesus said verily verily I say unto
[1:08:53] you that you'll sit on twelve Thrones
[1:08:56] judging the twelve tribes there you are
[1:09:01] that's the redeemed the redeemed elders
[1:09:04] so we have the Twelve Apostles they were
[1:09:08] redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:09:11] the twelve sons of Jacob were not
[1:09:14] redeemed during their lifetime right
[1:09:16] they were under the sacrifice of bulls
[1:09:18] and goats but they were we know in the
[1:09:21] heart of the earth in paradise but then
[1:09:24] the blood of Jesus redeemed them then
[1:09:26] right they were redeemed by the blood of
[1:09:29] Christ so look at this is when Jesus
[1:09:33] says it Jesus taught this twice in the
[1:09:36] scripture he taught it this is the first
[1:09:40] time brother Bam's talking about Jesus
[1:09:42] taught this after the encounter with the
[1:09:44] rich young ruler he said again I say to
[1:09:47] you it's easier for a camel to go
[1:09:49] through the eye of a needle than for a
[1:09:50] rich man to enter the kingdom of God
[1:09:52] when his disciples heard that they were
[1:09:54] exceedingly amazed saying who then can
[1:09:57] be saved but Jesus beheld them instead
[1:10:01] of them with men this is impossible but
[1:10:04] with God all things are possible now
[1:10:08] look at this the disciples in this entry
[1:10:10] this is kind of
[1:10:11] ever thought but isn't it interesting
[1:10:12] that his disciples realize how rich they
[1:10:14] were they realized how rich they were
[1:10:17] even in the Bible times because they
[1:10:19] said how could who can be saved then so
[1:10:24] see even though they weren't Laodicea
[1:10:26] they still felt rich is that right he
[1:10:29] said who can even be saved can we even
[1:10:31] be saved right so see even they realize
[1:10:35] how rich we are in church today we ought
[1:10:37] to realize how rich we are as well we're
[1:10:41] very blessed we're very fortunate we
[1:10:43] have everything we need whether we pay
[1:10:45] for by debt or by cash or whatever you
[1:10:47] have we can still get most things that
[1:10:49] we have need of and the disciples were
[1:10:51] shocked by this who can be saved
[1:10:54] if it's easier for a camel to get
[1:10:57] through an eye of a needle than a rich
[1:10:59] man to get to heaven who is going to be
[1:11:01] saying no where Jesus saying it's very
[1:11:03] hard to be saved because of the
[1:11:05] temptation of money but Jesus assures
[1:11:07] them with God all things are possible
[1:11:10] amen hallelujah
[1:11:12] and he was going to make this possible
[1:11:14] through the blood now he goes on to say
[1:11:17] then answered Peter said then behold we
[1:11:19] have forsaken all and followed thee what
[1:11:22] shall we have therefore so Peter saying
[1:11:25] you know the Raheel the rich young ruler
[1:11:26] won't sacrifice money but we've left
[1:11:28] everything what are we going to receive
[1:11:31] and Jesus said verily I say to you that
[1:11:33] ye which have followed me in the
[1:11:35] regeneration when the Son of man shall
[1:11:38] sit in the throne of his glory ye also
[1:11:41] shall sit upon twelve Thrones this in
[1:11:44] judging the twelve tribes of Israel you
[1:11:49] catch that the apostles of Jesus would
[1:11:52] judge the other twelve tribes and I
[1:11:56] wonder if the heads of those tribes will
[1:11:57] be like their right hand man because
[1:12:01] they are judging so in other words maybe
[1:12:02] Peter would sit right above Ruben or
[1:12:05] something like that
[1:12:06] because Peter the apostles are going to
[1:12:09] judge all twelve tribes right so that
[1:12:13] means even in the New Jerusalem there's
[1:12:14] going to be twelve tribes of Israel oh
[1:12:16] how God loves Israel amen
[1:12:18] how he loves his people praise the Lord
[1:12:21] even though he blind he still was
[1:12:24] say that his love is going to return
[1:12:26] he's gonna graph them back in to that
[1:12:28] holy tree amen
[1:12:30] all the love of God and he says everyone
[1:12:34] that's forsaken houses brethren sisters
[1:12:36] father mother or wife or children or
[1:12:39] lands for my name's sake shall receive a
[1:12:41] hundredfold and shall inherit
[1:12:44] everlasting life so now we know what a
[1:12:47] hundredfold is a hundredfold is ruling
[1:12:49] over groups of people so if you forsake
[1:12:54] everything houses lands families that is
[1:12:58] the hundredfold reward is being able to
[1:13:01] rule over large groups of people I like
[1:13:04] it amen so I destruct me when you
[1:13:06] forsake everyone God can trust you to
[1:13:09] rule over everyone I just struck me amen
[1:13:13] see Peter left everything he had life
[1:13:15] and everything behind there he left
[1:13:17] everything and because he forsook
[1:13:20] everything for Christ Christ says now
[1:13:22] you can rule over everything else that
[1:13:24] you left amen but many that are first
[1:13:30] shall be last and the last shall be
[1:13:34] first praise God I haven't studied on
[1:13:36] that so I don't know I'm not gonna say
[1:13:37] nothing about that I gotta study up on
[1:13:39] that I noticed Jesus preaches this twice
[1:13:44] he tells them you will judge the twelve
[1:13:47] tribes now remember they're just common
[1:13:48] fishermen right brogrammer said Peter
[1:13:50] was just a brawny big muscled fisherman
[1:13:53] you know he'd pulled the nets and he
[1:13:55] would he would do the business he'd do
[1:13:57] the money in the transaction and he was
[1:13:59] just a burly man some of them were tax
[1:14:01] collectors you know me this much money
[1:14:03] they had their they had their calculator
[1:14:05] you know of course we just dramatized it
[1:14:07] today they just had you know the beads
[1:14:08] that they would do what's that called
[1:14:10] the abacus they just had the advocates
[1:14:12] there that's all they did but they were
[1:14:14] willing to leave the abacus for Christ
[1:14:16] amen they're willing to leave the
[1:14:18] fishing nets for Christ these were just
[1:14:21] common men they were not great men but
[1:14:23] God chooses those twelve to lead over
[1:14:27] his kingdom of the twelve sons of Jacob
[1:14:29] because of all that they left for Christ
[1:14:33] so Jesus reassures them a second time
[1:14:36] the
[1:14:37] first time was after the rich young
[1:14:38] ruler where they thought who can be
[1:14:42] saved then and Jesus assured them you
[1:14:44] will judge the 12 tribes you've left
[1:14:47] everything you will get a reward for
[1:14:49] everything you've left aren't you glad
[1:14:50] Church you've got a reward over there
[1:14:52] we're not living for that but we're
[1:14:53] thankful that there is a reward because
[1:14:55] we've left everything dear to us to
[1:14:58] follow God's message of this hour amen
[1:15:05] the second time he has to reassure them
[1:15:07] is at the Last Supper but behold the
[1:15:11] hand of him that betrayed me is with me
[1:15:13] on the table so Judas was right there
[1:15:14] and true the Son of Man goeth as it was
[1:15:17] determined but woe unto them I'm sorry
[1:15:20] that man by whom he is betrayed and they
[1:15:22] began to enquire among themselves which
[1:15:24] of them it was that should do this thing
[1:15:27] and members during that time that Judas
[1:15:30] took the SOT from Jesus and Jesus said
[1:15:32] it's he told Johnny said it's the one
[1:15:34] that I give this out to so everybody
[1:15:37] else is saying Oh Lord is that you I
[1:15:39] don't feel like I've betrayed they were
[1:15:41] all searching their hearts and at a time
[1:15:43] where everybody's searching their hearts
[1:15:44] Judas is over there eating instead of
[1:15:47] searching his heart that's what we
[1:15:49] should do Church with the whole world is
[1:15:50] feasting today and making merry today we
[1:15:53] should be searching our hearts to make
[1:15:54] sure we're true to Christ having
[1:15:58] communion with Christ making sure we're
[1:16:00] pure we would never leave the message
[1:16:02] for anything because the message is
[1:16:03] God's Word amen but there Judas is well
[1:16:07] I'll just take another bite instead of
[1:16:10] searching his heart we need to search
[1:16:12] our hearts amen and the very next thing
[1:16:16] is an ark so Judas must have left and
[1:16:18] then pretty soon the other having
[1:16:19] communion can think of it this is
[1:16:21] supposed to be such a solemn time right
[1:16:23] this is such supposed to be such a holy
[1:16:25] time it's Jesus's Supper it's his last
[1:16:28] supper Don the disciples might not know
[1:16:29] that and after Judas leaves he must have
[1:16:33] went out got some more vidoes or he must
[1:16:35] so go get some more food or something
[1:16:36] like that help the poor after that they
[1:16:39] start looking around saying look at look
[1:16:44] at Bartholomew over there my ministry is
[1:16:45] ten times his I'm twice the preacher
[1:16:49] that Peter is
[1:16:51] imagine they're Jesus just washed their
[1:16:54] feet
[1:16:55] Peter said all just wash all of me they
[1:16:58] were so humbled a few minutes ago and
[1:17:00] now just a few minutes later now they're
[1:17:02] arguing about whose preacher who's the
[1:17:04] better preacher you know actually more
[1:17:08] Souls got healed under my ministry Peter
[1:17:10] than yours
[1:17:12] thank you imagine Jesus he just humbled
[1:17:16] himself and now they're busy exalting
[1:17:18] themselves churches shows what will
[1:17:20] happen without the baptism of the Holy
[1:17:21] Ghost Oh can't we hope it makes us see
[1:17:24] how important the baptism of the Holy
[1:17:26] Ghost is we can have a beautiful service
[1:17:28] like last Sunday or Wednesday any
[1:17:30] service we can have a glorious service
[1:17:32] and if we're not careful the very next
[1:17:34] service we can be carnal we can be upset
[1:17:36] of people in the church we can have
[1:17:38] communion on Sunday night and then
[1:17:39] Wednesday all upset with brother Jesse
[1:17:41] or something like that
[1:17:43] well what happened what happened to love
[1:17:45] we got to stay under the anointing of
[1:17:47] God amen
[1:17:48] look how quickly they slipped in and out
[1:17:50] of the anointing Peter so homo wash all
[1:17:53] of me and pretty soon he's saying well
[1:17:54] my ministry I got the keys to the
[1:17:56] kingdom
[1:17:56] what do you got yeah you leaned on his
[1:17:58] bosom but look how great I am my so
[1:18:03] Jesus has to stop them and he does it
[1:18:07] with wisdom the kings of the Gentiles
[1:18:10] exercise lordship over them but they
[1:18:13] that exercise authority upon them are
[1:18:15] called benefactors but ye shall not be
[1:18:17] so you're not gonna be like them he that
[1:18:20] is greatest among you let him be as the
[1:18:22] younger and he there's chief as he that
[1:18:27] does serve because they were arguing
[1:18:29] they had a strife among themselves which
[1:18:31] should be a count of the greatest
[1:18:33] remember they had this trouble a few
[1:18:35] months earlier when somebody's wife came
[1:18:39] up and said master we love you can my
[1:18:42] son sit on your right left hand and all
[1:18:44] the disciples got a certain that mother
[1:18:45] so why she's so selfish right can't
[1:18:50] James and John I want my sons of zebedee
[1:18:53] I want them on the right left hand and
[1:18:55] Jesus said that's not for me to give
[1:18:57] that's for the father to give see how
[1:19:01] carnal if we're not careful and that
[1:19:03] Jesus even says the gen
[1:19:04] do this they exercise lordship over you
[1:19:07] like I've talked to different people
[1:19:08] that have come out of bad churches and
[1:19:10] they and they always say the same thing
[1:19:12] the pastor kind tries to control
[1:19:14] everything in their life they can't send
[1:19:16] a text without the pastor's approval
[1:19:18] they can't buy something at the store
[1:19:21] without the pastor's approval they can't
[1:19:24] go to a family function without the
[1:19:26] pastor's approval I'm glad you don't
[1:19:28] experience that right I don't tell you
[1:19:32] what to do I tell you to follow the
[1:19:33] leadership of the Holy Ghost if you want
[1:19:35] my opinion I'll give it to you but I'm
[1:19:38] not exercising lordship over you I'm an
[1:19:41] example to you amen
[1:19:43] the Lord over you I'm an example to you
[1:19:46] that's exactly right but see they're
[1:19:49] arguing who's the greatest right after
[1:19:52] Jesus humbled himself took the towel
[1:19:55] washed all their feet and he said do
[1:19:59] this when I'm gone make sure you wash
[1:20:01] each other's feet when I'm gone and so
[1:20:05] this moment the future rulers are
[1:20:09] arguing about who's greater the day
[1:20:12] before he was crucified what a humbling
[1:20:16] experience we're arguing worrying with
[1:20:19] Jesus but our thoughts are not on Jesus
[1:20:21] it wouldn't it would not be so sad no no
[1:20:23] wonder he was called the man of sorrows
[1:20:24] here is he knows his crucifixion coming
[1:20:27] and his 12 apostles or 11 are arguing
[1:20:30] about who's greater and Jesus gonna show
[1:20:33] them there's none of you great I'm the
[1:20:34] great one I'm coming to make a sacrifice
[1:20:37] I'm coming to serve you and so this
[1:20:41] moment Jesus stops and says for whether
[1:20:44] is greater he that sitteth at me or he
[1:20:46] that serveth it's not he that sitteth at
[1:20:48] meat but I am among you as he that
[1:20:50] serveth so who was washing their feet
[1:20:53] who is the one humbling themselves
[1:20:54] it was Christ Christ wasn't arguing
[1:20:57] about who's got a greater preaching
[1:20:59] ministry me or you who's more popular
[1:21:01] who has more likes on Facebook you or me
[1:21:04] right who's got a bigger church your
[1:21:07] church or my church Christ wasn't
[1:21:10] arguing about that he was trying to do
[1:21:12] one thing the Bible said his face was
[1:21:14] set like flint toward the cross he had
[1:21:17] one emotive objective
[1:21:18] to take the sins of you and I and then
[1:21:23] he assures them now look look at his
[1:21:24] mercy
[1:21:25] look how merciful is to these 12 or live
[1:21:27] these 11 apostles he says ye are they
[1:21:31] which have continued with me in my
[1:21:33] temptations
[1:21:35] now remember church Judas didn't
[1:21:37] continue
[1:21:38] he continued most of the time but what
[1:21:40] he skipped out of the last few moments
[1:21:42] see people can hang on they'll hang on
[1:21:45] to the last few minutes before the
[1:21:46] rapture but the bride will hang on every
[1:21:49] minute amen there's nothing in my hands
[1:21:51] that want to let go of Jesus's Amen I'm
[1:21:54] not going to let go I'm gonna continue
[1:21:56] with Christ all the way till either my
[1:21:58] death or my body change amen
[1:22:01] I'm going to continue with Christ
[1:22:03] because Judas held on for a while but
[1:22:05] then he let go I could just make a quick
[1:22:07] money deal here and he sold out the son
[1:22:10] of man so Jesus serves them you're
[1:22:13] arguing about who's greater but let me
[1:22:15] assure you you've continued with me and
[1:22:17] I'm giving you a kingdom as my father at
[1:22:20] the point in me remember Jesus knew
[1:22:22] these guys were going to be filled with
[1:22:23] the Holy Ghost and then there were all
[1:22:25] be martyrs except like one or two
[1:22:26] history is uncertain about one of them
[1:22:28] but almost every one of them except John
[1:22:31] was a martyr so Jesus knew they would
[1:22:34] give their lives for it so he has
[1:22:36] patience aren't you glad God is so
[1:22:38] patient with you and I look what he says
[1:22:42] next
[1:22:43] he said I've appointed you a kingdom
[1:22:45] that ye may eat and drink at my table in
[1:22:48] my kingdom oh my and sit on Thrones
[1:22:52] judging the twelve tribes of Israel and
[1:22:57] the Lord said Simon Simon I love this
[1:23:00] Satan had desired to have you that he
[1:23:03] may sift you as wheat but I prayed for
[1:23:06] thee that thy faith fail not and when
[1:23:09] thou art converted strengthen thy
[1:23:10] brethren in that beautiful in the midst
[1:23:13] of their arguing Jesus says you're not
[1:23:15] going to be like the Gentiles you've
[1:23:17] stayed with me so I'm going to reward
[1:23:19] you and you will sit at my table aren't
[1:23:22] you glad we're sitting at Christ's table
[1:23:23] right now amen
[1:23:25] his spiritual table were feasting on the
[1:23:28] Word of God
[1:23:29] and we're sitting at his table enjoying
[1:23:31] his word
[1:23:32] and he says not only that but you will
[1:23:35] sit on Thrones judging the 12 tribes of
[1:23:37] Israel
[1:23:39] because one day you're not gonna argue
[1:23:41] about who's greater remember they
[1:23:43] worried about it all the way to the day
[1:23:44] of Pentecost because member Jesus said
[1:23:47] that John you know Peters like well
[1:23:49] what's John gonna do they were he's all
[1:23:51] worried peter was worried all about John
[1:23:53] what's John's ministry gonna be like
[1:23:55] what's he gonna do and Jesus said what
[1:23:57] is it to you if I Terry or John Terry or
[1:24:00] if John's alive until I come he said
[1:24:04] follow thou me so see that's a great
[1:24:07] lesson if we're worried about other
[1:24:09] people if we're in competition or if
[1:24:12] we're feeling less than others we got to
[1:24:14] get our eyes off of other people and
[1:24:16] we've got to follow Christ for our lives
[1:24:19] not wonder I wonder if that brother will
[1:24:21] be greater than me I wonder if that
[1:24:23] preacher will be more rewards than I
[1:24:25] have we're not worried about other
[1:24:27] people we're worried about what does
[1:24:28] Jesus want amen
[1:24:31] what does Jesus want me to do I've got
[1:24:35] to get my eyes off of myself and others
[1:24:37] I got to get my eyes on Christ I love
[1:24:40] this but Jesus Jesus says Satan is
[1:24:42] trying to kill you Peter but I have
[1:24:45] prayed for you what's more powerful
[1:24:47] Satan's plans or Jesus's prayer the
[1:24:50] prayer of Jesus is so much more powerful
[1:24:52] amen
[1:24:53] then all of the plans are the gates of
[1:24:56] hell
[1:24:56] Jesus's prayer will overcome all of
[1:24:59] Satan's plans to wipe you off the earth
[1:25:01] amen
[1:25:03] that thy faith fail not and one that
[1:25:07] wild art converted strengthen thy
[1:25:09] brother so Jesus had already prayed for
[1:25:12] Peter Lord don't let his faith be lost
[1:25:15] keep him strong that is faith be strong
[1:25:18] Lord let him be able to withstand all
[1:25:21] these attacks of Satan before until he
[1:25:24] gets the baptism of the Holy Ghost let
[1:25:26] him not fail Oh Church don't you feel
[1:25:29] like that don't you pray for that for
[1:25:30] other people in our church I pray the
[1:25:32] same thing for all of you Lord keep them
[1:25:34] strong don't let their faith fail let
[1:25:37] them serve you let their power flow
[1:25:39] through them let them not fail that the
[1:25:41] hand of God be with each one of you
[1:25:43] that's a real intercessor
[1:25:46] he prayed for his own little fellowship
[1:25:48] there he was praying that their faith
[1:25:50] that the three and a half years he
[1:25:52] invested in their lives would not come
[1:25:55] to naught but that it would have a fruit
[1:25:57] at the end of it and how many want to
[1:25:59] see fruit in our lives the first weekend
[1:26:03] of June will be 12 years I pastored this
[1:26:05] church I don't want to lose the fruit of
[1:26:07] all the labor that we put into this
[1:26:10] church we want to see fruits in heaven
[1:26:13] because the rewards but because but the
[1:26:15] Bible says if people choose sin the
[1:26:17] Bible said they could lose their reward
[1:26:19] and still be saved so we've got to make
[1:26:22] sure we keep laboring we keep praying
[1:26:24] and we keep our faith strong and we
[1:26:27] don't lose any reward and that we do all
[1:26:29] that Christ wants us to do Jesus prayed
[1:26:38] for them that Peter that his faith would
[1:26:40] fail not and he prayed what all let
[1:26:43] Peter OH let Peter be filled with the
[1:26:45] Holy Ghost then he can strengthen the
[1:26:47] Brethren and Jesus prayer was answered
[1:26:49] ha ha hey man glory
[1:26:51] now don't forget this Jesus prayed for
[1:26:53] you to neither pray I for these alone
[1:26:56] but for them which also shall believe on
[1:26:59] me through their word so after the
[1:27:03] Apostles the word kept spreading and
[1:27:05] Jesus prayed for them that would hear it
[1:27:07] through the Apostles that they may all
[1:27:10] be one I wonder if that's how we feel
[1:27:15] we're all one here in Christ we all
[1:27:18] think the same thing about Christ we all
[1:27:21] want the same thing amen
[1:27:24] but we're not what we shouldn't think
[1:27:27] well which something bad would happen to
[1:27:29] that person I wish I was greater than
[1:27:32] this person or I wish i had something
[1:27:34] greater we have to have the one idea for
[1:27:37] Christ to be glorified in our myths now
[1:27:40] if you have that burden they'll make you
[1:27:42] pray more for everybody in the church
[1:27:44] it'll make you love people in the church
[1:27:46] more it make you reach out and and
[1:27:49] contact one another and fellowship
[1:27:52] together and all these things because we
[1:27:55] have one idea we have one mind that's
[1:27:58] the mind of Christ
[1:27:59] geez this was Jesus prayer that Bride of
[1:28:02] Christ fellowship we could it be one
[1:28:04] we'd all be in unity about what God
[1:28:07] wants for our lives praise the Lord
[1:28:11] I don't forget this remember this is
[1:28:15] about how Jesus said they continued with
[1:28:17] me the Bible says this again in acts
[1:28:19] 1:21 wherefore these men which have
[1:28:22] company with us all the time that the
[1:28:25] Lord Jesus when went in and out among us
[1:28:28] so see that's what the apostles were
[1:28:31] they were with Christ all the time and
[1:28:33] that's what I want my testimony I'm with
[1:28:35] Jesus all the time oh it's Saturday
[1:28:37] night what did you do last night you go
[1:28:39] to the big game now I was in prayer and
[1:28:40] study that's where I was I was with
[1:28:42] Jesus right where did you go on Friday
[1:28:45] night already go for the week and
[1:28:47] originally on your vacation I spent my
[1:28:48] time with Christ I was with the word I
[1:28:51] was in special meetings my life just
[1:28:54] centered around Jesus Christ amen
[1:28:58] now of course we know they were
[1:29:00] scattered right at his crucifixion but
[1:29:02] they were saying for the majority of the
[1:29:04] time that whole time before that time of
[1:29:06] scattering they were always with Jesus
[1:29:08] Jesus would go in and out to pray
[1:29:10] remember he go pray by himself to the
[1:29:12] mountain he come back or he'd walk
[1:29:14] across the sea and meet them you know on
[1:29:15] the sea on the troubled season he calmed
[1:29:18] the storms so he would go in and out but
[1:29:20] the whole time all the time they devoted
[1:29:23] all their time to Jesus Christ amen now
[1:29:27] a few more things here brother Graham
[1:29:31] said I can prove that there is degrees
[1:29:32] in heaven and that they'll not all be on
[1:29:36] the same equal but you'll have equal
[1:29:39] eternal life
[1:29:41] so now Jesus is we know Jesus telling
[1:29:45] these apostles you're gonna be higher
[1:29:46] than other Christians you're gonna have
[1:29:48] a higher degree or higher
[1:29:49] responsibilities than other Christians
[1:29:52] because the Bible said the kings that
[1:29:54] there was bring their glory and honor
[1:29:55] into the city and then he goes in he
[1:29:59] quotes what we already read where Jesus
[1:30:01] says you will sit upon the twelve
[1:30:02] Thrones judging the twelve tribes of
[1:30:04] Israel program said it again see it's
[1:30:07] another it's exactly the system that Oh
[1:30:08] that'll be far supreme to anything in
[1:30:11] that there'll be no sin
[1:30:13] but yet they'll have rulers and so forth
[1:30:15] in the cities when everything will be
[1:30:17] carried on in the way of eternal life
[1:30:20] and that beautiful church every time you
[1:30:23] turn on the news or whatever on your
[1:30:25] phone or whatever you do every time
[1:30:27] there's another political figure who's
[1:30:29] fallen into corruption corruption Oh
[1:30:32] sexual corruption financial corruption
[1:30:35] ethical corruption they just keep
[1:30:37] falling but not in this government
[1:30:40] because this government's called eternal
[1:30:42] life amen hallelujah not in this one he
[1:30:46] said all the all these natural
[1:30:47] governments we have you know the
[1:30:49] Governor of Ohio and the prezi knighted
[1:30:51] States whatever you think of him you
[1:30:53] know that we have our natural government
[1:30:55] here but there's sin and corruption but
[1:30:58] in that land he said you know everything
[1:31:01] will be carried over in the way of
[1:31:03] eternal life so the leaders there will
[1:31:06] make decisions out of divine love and
[1:31:08] they'll never be a wrong decision made
[1:31:11] it'll be the perfect decision because
[1:31:13] they've gotten divine Holy Ghost in them
[1:31:16] they've got the decision-maker they've
[1:31:18] got the judge in them as we said on
[1:31:19] Wednesday night they've got the judge on
[1:31:22] the throne of the heart
[1:31:23] well how Wednesday seems like so many
[1:31:25] long time ago doesn't it my here's
[1:31:29] another quote future home brother madam
[1:31:32] said each one of these had 12
[1:31:33] foundations each one had the emerald and
[1:31:35] the different stones which represent the
[1:31:37] 12 tribes of Israel and the Apostles
[1:31:39] each over that big one solid pearl gate
[1:31:41] set a name of an apostle and didn't
[1:31:45] Jesus say you'll sit on the twelfth
[1:31:46] roans judging the twelve tribes of
[1:31:47] Israel who set at the gate to judge when
[1:31:50] they come into the city oh my there you
[1:31:52] are the kings of the earth entering into
[1:31:55] the city comes before the Apostolic
[1:31:59] Judge as jesus promised it hallelujah in
[1:32:04] that beautiful the kings of the earth
[1:32:06] and the twelve tribes of Israel will
[1:32:09] bring their glory and honor into the
[1:32:11] city and before they get in that city
[1:32:14] they've got to stand next to Peter they
[1:32:16] got to go through the judge of Peter
[1:32:17] they got to go through the judge of Paul
[1:32:19] of John a Bartholomew all these
[1:32:23] men that first took everything for the
[1:32:25] gospel Jesus said you've left everything
[1:32:27] and looked Church it was only three and
[1:32:29] a half years right it was three and a
[1:32:32] half years and after that three and a
[1:32:34] half years they get the Holy Ghost they
[1:32:36] spent the rest of their lives for Christ
[1:32:38] they probably lived a 50 60 70 we know
[1:32:40] John lived in his 90s perhaps a little
[1:32:42] longer but look how small their lives
[1:32:45] was but because they left everything for
[1:32:47] Jesus it was a great sacrifice in his
[1:32:50] eyes amen
[1:32:52] let's make a great sacrifice for Christ
[1:32:55] amen let's make sure our short vapor on
[1:32:58] this earth is always given for Jesus
[1:33:02] Christ let him be the center of every
[1:33:04] decision let him sit on the throne of
[1:33:06] our hearts amen forsake everything
[1:33:09] have you ever sake everything you'll
[1:33:11] rule over everything hallelujah don't
[1:33:14] let that world rule over you amen so now
[1:33:19] he calls them apostolic judges Omaha
[1:33:23] hallelujah brother Ram calls this a
[1:33:27] special promise from Jesus in the church
[1:33:31] age book he's quoting about how each of
[1:33:35] the seven churches messengers will
[1:33:37] present the bride to Christ for their
[1:33:39] age programs talking about this and he
[1:33:42] says a very great responsibility as well
[1:33:44] as a wonderful privilege is his lot to
[1:33:47] these men God's make special promises so
[1:33:50] the church age messengers have a special
[1:33:53] reward
[1:33:53] just like the Twelve Apostles of Jesus
[1:33:55] Christ they have a higher degree of
[1:33:58] authority and honor in heaven because of
[1:34:02] what they sacrificed on earth that's
[1:34:05] right
[1:34:07] just as in the case of the Twelve
[1:34:09] Apostles sitting on the twelve Thrones
[1:34:11] judging the twelve tribes of Israel then
[1:34:13] remember Paul was given a special
[1:34:14] promise that of presenting the people of
[1:34:18] the bride in his day to Jesus because
[1:34:22] this is what the scripture says I'm
[1:34:23] jealous
[1:34:24] over you with godly jealousy for I've
[1:34:26] espouse you to one husband that I may
[1:34:29] present you as a chaste virgin to Christ
[1:34:32] isn't that beautiful Paul preached the
[1:34:36] message to them they got
[1:34:37] save they got filled with the holy ghost
[1:34:38] and because of that spiritually when
[1:34:41] Paul was preaching them the baptism the
[1:34:43] Holy Ghost and they got saved it was
[1:34:45] like Paul espousing them
[1:34:47] Paul said you're now engaged to Jesus
[1:34:49] Christ I pronounced an engagement you
[1:34:52] believed in Christ
[1:34:53] now you're espoused to him now you've
[1:34:55] entered into the engagement of Jesus
[1:34:57] Christ Hey and then because of that
[1:35:00] because he engaged them to Christ he
[1:35:02] will now present them to Christ amen
[1:35:05] program said so will it be with every
[1:35:08] messenger who has been faithful to the
[1:35:11] Word of God for his hour and age it will
[1:35:15] be so in the last day it will be the
[1:35:16] same special reward that was given to
[1:35:19] Paul amen
[1:35:23] now watch the humility of brother
[1:35:25] branham he's again talking about Peter
[1:35:28] how he said I left mother father he
[1:35:31] quotes this scripture again now look
[1:35:33] what he says he says you'll set and
[1:35:35] judge the twelve Thrones so the twelve
[1:35:37] tribes Israel now look how humble
[1:35:38] brother Aaron is he says now you know I
[1:35:40] don't want to do that so he's talking
[1:35:46] about how the Apostles are going to be
[1:35:48] judges over the twelve tribes or Branson
[1:35:50] now you know I don't want to do that and
[1:35:54] really from the bottom of my heart I
[1:35:56] don't want nothing great or classical
[1:36:00] you know what I want I just want to look
[1:36:03] at him I just want to see him so see as
[1:36:08] important part as we end this services
[1:36:09] is to let you know there are degrees
[1:36:11] that we must be faithful but no true
[1:36:14] Christian really wants to be the
[1:36:15] greatest one because if we do that we
[1:36:17] just go right back to the Last Supper
[1:36:18] when they were arguing it back there
[1:36:20] we don't want to go the Last Supper you
[1:36:22] want to go to the marriage supper the
[1:36:24] lamb amen you see now we know whether we
[1:36:28] just read brother Brandon gets the
[1:36:29] response reward but he's so humble he
[1:36:32] doesn't even listen how I serving God
[1:36:34] he's not doing it to get the reward
[1:36:37] in other words like this church we are
[1:36:40] not trying to earn eternal life we
[1:36:43] already have eternal life amen
[1:36:47] we don't do how it works because we want
[1:36:49] to be saved we
[1:36:50] works because we are saved amen that's
[1:36:54] what our calling is in life not to focus
[1:36:57] on all I'm striving for this I'm I'm
[1:36:59] striving to get the reward we're
[1:37:01] striving to love Jesus more and the
[1:37:05] works that we do we do through his faith
[1:37:07] right through his love through faith in
[1:37:10] his name and it's the love of Jesus
[1:37:12] working out through us because we've
[1:37:14] already got eternal life but I'm not
[1:37:17] sitting behind you know my desk studying
[1:37:19] saying well I can preach harder than the
[1:37:21] preacher up in Sheffield or Alby I'm not
[1:37:24] in a car or I know this message gonna be
[1:37:26] there's gonna blow out the people in the
[1:37:28] south that's not what I'm preached
[1:37:30] setting for I'm just asking Jesus that's
[1:37:33] I pray last night give me the food to
[1:37:36] feed your sheep that's what I asked for
[1:37:39] not trying to make ourselves anything
[1:37:42] but to do what God has called us to do
[1:37:44] because I love God I'm willing to serve
[1:37:46] God in this way because he has saved me
[1:37:48] I want to serve his people amen quite a
[1:37:52] difference isn't it the one who's gonna
[1:37:54] get it doesn't want it he does he says I
[1:37:58] don't want to special reward like that
[1:38:00] I remember the voice when he went beyond
[1:38:02] the curtain of time he said you're
[1:38:03] lifted up higher he said you're gonna be
[1:38:06] judged first you were a leader in life
[1:38:08] and he's like I don't run a special
[1:38:10] reward I don't have to be different and
[1:38:12] God always exalts the humble amen
[1:38:16] God always exhausts the humble he says
[1:38:21] you know what I just want to look at him
[1:38:23] I just want to see him he tells the
[1:38:26] story of the african-american man his
[1:38:28] name was he was a slave but he got
[1:38:30] saved one night in one of their meetings
[1:38:31] in there I must been in there their
[1:38:34] property and the the boss said what's
[1:38:37] his you said you was freezin yep
[1:38:39] come on over the office I want to talk
[1:38:41] to you a while so he went over there and
[1:38:42] said Sam I heard you was free you know
[1:38:44] you're my slave I said yes sir boss I
[1:38:46] know that last night the Lord Jesus set
[1:38:48] me free from the penalty of sin and
[1:38:50] death glory oh we need to feel like that
[1:38:53] hallelujah
[1:38:54] he said I'm free boss the Lord saved me
[1:38:57] he said you really mean that he said yes
[1:38:59] I do he said what if he wasn't a slave
[1:39:01] what would you do I'd spend the rest of
[1:39:03] my time telling my brethren he said all
[1:39:08] right if you go down he said if you go
[1:39:10] down with me the court this morning I'm
[1:39:12] gonna sign the ticket the Emancipation
[1:39:14] Proclamation I'm gonna set you free to
[1:39:16] preach the gospel to your brethren and
[1:39:18] after he preached for many years his
[1:39:19] death come to him he was lying sick to
[1:39:21] die and a lot of his white brethren came
[1:39:23] in to look at him so they looked at him
[1:39:25] and he was lying there like in a coma
[1:39:26] and while you woke up he looked around
[1:39:28] and seen them said well haven't I went
[1:39:29] over yet and he said I was dreaming of
[1:39:31] something that I just got in the door
[1:39:32] they said to me now Sam so he just came
[1:39:35] into heaven Sam come on
[1:39:37] I'm gonna put I want you to put on your
[1:39:39] robe in your crown and so sam says don't
[1:39:43] talk to me about robes and crown don't
[1:39:46] talk to me about robes and crown just
[1:39:48] let me stand and look at him a thousand
[1:39:51] years now a man program said I think
[1:39:56] that's just the way we all feel isn't it
[1:40:01] we don't want no crowns no great things
[1:40:05] only thing I want to do is just look and
[1:40:08] that's all if I could just look at his
[1:40:11] face that would pay me back for every
[1:40:14] effort hallelujah glory just to look at
[1:40:18] him and see him I'm trusting believing
[1:40:21] hoping try my best someday I'll get to
[1:40:24] see him amen isn't that beautiful
[1:40:31] the man who
[1:40:33] we know by the scripture and by the
[1:40:35] vindication of the Holy Ghost by a
[1:40:37] pillar of fire with is thus saith the
[1:40:39] Lord messages the message of the hour
[1:40:41] the very one who is the messenger
[1:40:43] doesn't want to be the leader but he's
[1:40:46] going to be because of his humility Amen
[1:40:51] that's glorious and church that ought to
[1:40:54] pay us back for any little thing we give
[1:40:55] up for Jesus just to look upon the real
[1:40:58] face of Christ I know this is the
[1:41:00] closest thing that we got on earth but
[1:41:02] one day we're going to see the real face
[1:41:04] of Christ and it will pay you back for
[1:41:08] anything you forsaken for the fear of
[1:41:11] Jesus any little thing of the world
[1:41:13] giving up this temptation or giving that
[1:41:15] of that addiction or that that temporary
[1:41:17] pleasure anything you give up it'll all
[1:41:20] be worth it to see that lovely face of
[1:41:21] Jesus I got four minutes so let me close
[1:41:26] to this thought here brother branham
[1:41:30] gives us is such a it's such an example
[1:41:33] of the Holy Spirit striking brother
[1:41:34] branham he's preaching on all this and
[1:41:37] then all of a sudden he says he says let
[1:41:39] me show you a type from the Old
[1:41:40] Testament of this how elders will be
[1:41:42] given rulership later on and brother man
[1:41:47] said look at David portraying Christ see
[1:41:51] when David was coming into power
[1:41:53] the first thing he had an awful time
[1:41:55] coming into power yet he had the
[1:41:57] anointing on him yeah the anointing was
[1:41:59] on him and a lot of people thought he
[1:42:01] was just a little renegade little guy
[1:42:02] that was different
[1:42:03] trying to tear it up something but
[1:42:06] there's some men know that he was coming
[1:42:09] King they stayed right with him yeah
[1:42:14] brother I mean you couldn't get them
[1:42:16] away from him as they walked on who's he
[1:42:19] talking about the mighty men David's
[1:42:22] mighty men how many familiar with the
[1:42:23] mighty men there was thirty of them so
[1:42:27] brother names typing David as Christ and
[1:42:30] the mighty man he's typing as these
[1:42:33] twelve apostles or eleven you know
[1:42:34] twelve with Paul we know that he said
[1:42:37] one day he stood up there on the
[1:42:39] mountain looked down and seen it as
[1:42:40] little but loved a little city besieged
[1:42:42] by the enemy and he stood there
[1:42:43] remembered when he was a little boy he
[1:42:45] should take sheep out through there and
[1:42:47] drink that water it was real water we
[1:42:51] spoke of it not here long ago the waters
[1:42:52] of life and there is he said David said
[1:42:55] think I used to drink out of that little
[1:42:57] well you know the story and his least
[1:43:00] desire was a command to any man he had
[1:43:05] brother two of those men grabbed their
[1:43:08] swords and fought through 15 miles of
[1:43:10] Philistines chopping them from left to
[1:43:12] right to get him a drink of water out of
[1:43:15] that well they knowed he was coming in
[1:43:18] power yes sir one time one of them to
[1:43:20] save him jumped in the pit and killed a
[1:43:21] lion single-handedly they were warriors
[1:43:23] and when he come in power you know what
[1:43:27] he done he made each one of them a ruler
[1:43:30] over a certain city but ma'am said see
[1:43:34] see Christ there so David did what
[1:43:37] Christ did
[1:43:38] I'm sorry Christ was David was
[1:43:41] prefiguring what Christ was going to do
[1:43:42] see because jesus said he that overcomes
[1:43:45] shall rule over a city the overcomers
[1:43:49] today so now brother Ram brings the
[1:43:51] mighty men to our day we're supposed to
[1:43:54] be the mighty men we're supposed to be
[1:43:56] the ones that are holding on the Christ
[1:43:58] because we know he's going to rule this
[1:44:00] earth amen glory the cow inspired that
[1:44:05] is we cease coming in power Jesus will
[1:44:08] rule the world
[1:44:09] German the United States and all must
[1:44:11] fall every nation must all the kingdoms
[1:44:13] of the world has become the kingdoms of
[1:44:15] our God and of Christ and he'll ruled
[1:44:17] and reigned on them that's right didn't
[1:44:19] the Bible say that remember the Thyatira
[1:44:21] church age we preached on this remember
[1:44:23] this jesus said he that overcometh and
[1:44:27] keepeth my works unto the end to him
[1:44:29] will I give power over the nation's this
[1:44:33] is in the fire to your church age which
[1:44:35] was the fourth church age which was the
[1:44:37] darkest age of all of them ours is the
[1:44:40] most deceptive but brother man said
[1:44:42] Thyatira was the darkest the Bible calls
[1:44:46] it the depths of Satan so in the very
[1:44:51] depths of Satan those who had overcome
[1:44:54] the Jezebel religion amen jesus said you
[1:44:58] have power over nations
[1:45:00] amen and rule them with a rod of iron so
[1:45:04] not only does Jesus have a rod of iron
[1:45:06] but he must give a little rod of iron to
[1:45:08] all these rulers over nations you
[1:45:11] understand and that striking that's
[1:45:14] really something as the vessels of
[1:45:17] Potter shall they be broken to shivers
[1:45:20] he said even as I received of my father
[1:45:25] now I'm just taking a real there's my
[1:45:27] hour but I'm just gonna make a quick
[1:45:32] thing here let me hit the scripture here
[1:45:39] now there are coming oh this there was
[1:45:42] groups of mighty men how many know that
[1:45:43] overall 30 there was three overall 30
[1:45:46] their names are joash beam Eleazar and I
[1:45:49] couldn't find the third one but under
[1:45:51] that they had other men that were in
[1:45:53] groups of three benaiah was with another
[1:45:54] one I forget the other guys name but let
[1:45:57] me go back to the scripture there here's
[1:45:59] where the Bible said he had all those
[1:46:02] mighty men who strengthened the cells
[1:46:04] with him in his kingdom and all the
[1:46:05] Israel to make him King according to the
[1:46:07] word of Lord concerning Israel isn't
[1:46:09] that how you feel don't you want to make
[1:46:11] Jesus King in Akron amen
[1:46:13] don't you want to make Jesus King on
[1:46:15] this earth race God don't you want
[1:46:17] Christ to be the president right or the
[1:46:19] king we want Christ to be king there's a
[1:46:22] royal wedding yesterday
[1:46:23] but I tell you there's going to be a
[1:46:24] royal rioting at the rapture at the Brat
[1:46:26] at the rapture of the bride of Jesus
[1:46:28] Christ
[1:46:28] that's the royal wedding I'm concerned
[1:46:30] with amen let me be a part of that
[1:46:32] wedding amen how do you how do you know
[1:46:35] we're just that's really because I'm
[1:46:36] getting dressed today praise God
[1:46:38] amen I'm going through all the motions
[1:46:41] and I'm learning all the traditions and
[1:46:43] I've got to act like this I've got to
[1:46:44] stop doing that I got to make sure I say
[1:46:46] this I got to make sure I got that
[1:46:48] predestinated ring of unmerited grace on
[1:46:50] my finger I got to make sure I've got
[1:46:52] white robes I've got to have eternal
[1:46:54] life amen
[1:46:55] Barry he will be king Christ will be
[1:47:00] king on this earth hallelujah and I'm
[1:47:02] gonna stay with him until he's King
[1:47:04] hallelujah and I'm gonna back him up in
[1:47:06] my old little humble way that I do and
[1:47:10] this is the number of the mighty men
[1:47:12] whom David had joash beam
[1:47:14] and hatch my knight the chief of the
[1:47:16] captains he was the chief of all of them
[1:47:18] he lifted up his spear against 300 slain
[1:47:22] by him at one time after him was Eliezer
[1:47:26] the son of dodo that a whole height who
[1:47:28] was one of the three might ease isn't an
[1:47:31] interesting David had three that were
[1:47:32] higher than other didn't Jesus have
[1:47:34] three that were higher another Peter
[1:47:36] James and John well I just struck me
[1:47:37] right here there's Revelation right
[1:47:39] there the Holy Ghost pouring forth
[1:47:40] revelation right here three that were
[1:47:43] higher Peter James and John member he
[1:47:45] took them to the mountain he took them
[1:47:47] to raise Jerry his daughter from the
[1:47:49] dead hallelujah
[1:47:51] faith hope and charity now as I said I
[1:47:55] read through this this morning I
[1:47:56] couldn't find the other one but there's
[1:47:59] one more that is one of the three
[1:48:00] Mighty's now here's the one that brother
[1:48:03] BAM that I can back up what brother BAM
[1:48:05] said but nya was set over David's guard
[1:48:08] because of how mighty he was later in
[1:48:11] Solomon's rule he slew Joab and became
[1:48:13] captain of the hosts
[1:48:14] so what I'm saying is binaya is the only
[1:48:17] one I can find that has his reward
[1:48:19] recorded that I found brother Branham
[1:48:21] said these men David rewarded them later
[1:48:23] on and he no doubt no doubt he did but
[1:48:25] now is the one where we can clearly see
[1:48:27] that David later set benaiah over his
[1:48:30] guard and then Solomon said him as ruler
[1:48:33] over the entire army but nya that's why
[1:48:37] I thought I think I cam named his son by
[1:48:39] night after banai he's a mighty man he
[1:48:42] was not one of the three Mighty's but he
[1:48:43] was a mighty man so see that because of
[1:48:47] their faithful service because benaiah
[1:48:49] faithfully served David before he was
[1:48:51] King he was exalted to a higher position
[1:48:54] on the other side can everybody see that
[1:48:58] and let's stand to our feet I'm gonna
[1:49:00] read what this is the last quote he says
[1:49:02] I don't have the quote in front of me
[1:49:03] but I'll pull it up why don't I just
[1:49:04] pull it up here so everybody can see it
[1:49:06] let's stand
[1:49:08] look how brother branham applies this
[1:49:10] for us today
[1:49:20] where he says it he said we know he's
[1:49:24] coming in power so the least of his
[1:49:26] desire is a command to who who is it to
[1:49:29] us look at this this I'm driving to work
[1:49:34] and brother Graham says this and I just
[1:49:35] start laughing and almost crying because
[1:49:39] I'm a little bitty Timbuktu preacher we
[1:49:42] got any other little bitty Timbuktu
[1:49:45] civilians out there a little just a tiny
[1:49:48] butt Graham said the least of his
[1:49:51] desires is the command to us Jesus wants
[1:49:54] me to represent him in a little bitty
[1:49:57] Timbuktu where there ain't 50 cents of
[1:50:00] money where there ain't nothing or a
[1:50:04] poor bunch of people brother Graham said
[1:50:07] but that's a desire of Jesus hey man
[1:50:12] and Jesus he said oh you don't have to
[1:50:14] get so many you don't have to go to this
[1:50:16] just let me know that Jesus wants me to
[1:50:19] go that's all I need to know don't you
[1:50:23] like that I just started laughing like I
[1:50:25] said I'm gonna started crying because I
[1:50:26] felt like Jesus Christ was speaking to
[1:50:28] me right there I'm just a little tiny
[1:50:30] Timbuktu preacher in a really tiny
[1:50:33] church we don't have millions of dollars
[1:50:35] to build churches like all these other
[1:50:36] churches we don't have big numbers and
[1:50:39] things that astound people but if it's
[1:50:42] Jesus's desire for me to be a pastor at
[1:50:45] a little bitty Timbuktu Church then his
[1:50:48] least desire is a command to me well
[1:50:54] Olivia
[1:50:55] after five fifty or a hundred or 200 or
[1:50:58] 250 that's not how a real servant speaks
[1:51:01] they'll do whatever Jesus desires as
[1:51:04] long as it's his desire and then he
[1:51:07] brings it down to our sisters if Jesus
[1:51:10] wants me to do different act different
[1:51:11] like these sisters and things if Jesus
[1:51:13] doesn't want me to cut my hair if he
[1:51:16] wants to do a certain thing then bless
[1:51:17] God it's a privilege for me to do it
[1:51:21] there you are
[1:51:22] we know he's coming into power no matter
[1:51:24] what the world says if I have to lay
[1:51:26] aside every weight and the sin does
[1:51:28] easily beset me let me run with patience
[1:51:30] the race set before me let me look to
[1:51:33] the author and finisher of our faith
[1:51:34] Jesus Christ coming in power and the
[1:51:38] church said amen now I want you come up
[1:51:41] here by God's grace we'll close with
[1:51:43] that no matter what Jesus desires church
[1:51:47] it ought to be a command to us how many
[1:51:48] feel that way that's how I feel today
[1:51:51] these elders were just they were gonna
[1:51:54] have to suffer for a while but the
[1:51:56] reward would be so great later on just
[1:51:59] like David's mighty men they they
[1:52:01] suffered they were estranged but after
[1:52:04] David came into power things got better
[1:52:06] and that's how we are we've got to serve
[1:52:08] in our humble little little bitty lives
[1:52:10] and then later on Jesus will make us
[1:52:13] rulers over nations how many believe
[1:52:15] that we've got to forsake everything on
[1:52:19] this earth praise the Lord let's just
[1:52:23] bow our heads how many raise your hands
[1:52:24] say help me Lord to forsake everything
[1:52:26] maybe I'm still struggling with you know
[1:52:28] we know we all go through things we
[1:52:29] struggle with bless those hands my hands
[1:52:31] are up to
[1:52:32] Heavenly Father Lord we love you today
[1:52:36] we know you are coming into power every
[1:52:39] day I think about it Jesus every day I
[1:52:42] think about oh I wonder if this is the
[1:52:43] day you're gonna come so I beat my body
[1:52:48] and bring it under subjection I get on
[1:52:50] my knees and pray and read my Bible even
[1:52:54] when my flesh doesn't feel like it when
[1:52:55] life gets hard when we get discouraged
[1:52:58] Lord from time to time
[1:53:01] [Music]
[1:53:03] because the Lord we know you are coming
[1:53:06] back one day all creation is a witness
[1:53:10] of it the Sun the plants how they come
[1:53:15] back every year after death it's all
[1:53:17] witness Lord God that you're coming back
[1:53:20] not only that but you've come into our
[1:53:22] hearts by the Holy Ghost your God and we
[1:53:24] have the resurrection power inside of us
[1:53:26] Lord God where we've seen you move we've
[1:53:29] seen you do things we can never do on
[1:53:31] our own and we give you glory for that
[1:53:34] now lord help us to hear your voice
[1:53:37] help us to forsake everything Lord God
[1:53:40] that little thing we're struggling with
[1:53:43] still help us to verse a kid this
[1:53:46] morning dear god help us to leave behind
[1:53:49] anything that would hinder us Lord God

[1:53:54] lands mothers fathers children brothers
[1:54:00] sisters you said forsake everything for
[1:54:02] me and you'll be rewarded a hundredfold
[1:54:06] in this world and in the world to come
[1:54:13] I'll I'll Ouya Jesus Lord I feel so
[1:54:17] thankful that you've called me you've
[1:54:19] separated me from my church that I
