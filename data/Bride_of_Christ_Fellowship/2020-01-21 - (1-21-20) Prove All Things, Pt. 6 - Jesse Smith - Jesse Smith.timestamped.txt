[16:29] Saturday night at 6 p.m.
[16:31] Lord willing if the weather cooperates
[16:33] my brother Troy preached in force on

[16:38] Sunday service at 11 a.m. I do believe
[16:45] that's the only announcement there by
[16:49] God's grace I think that's it
[16:52] have any prayer requests here tonight
[16:54] anybody have any needs on their heart oh

[17:02] Fontaine I think passed away was it

[17:11] God's grace I had seen him back in May

[17:16] is Paul it had me I asked me to come
[17:19] preach and so I got to chat with him a
[17:21] little bit there but he's been preaching
[17:23] many many years and the message he has a
[17:26] great day yet a great testimony he was
[17:28] almost a major league baseball player
[17:29] and then God saved him and then he came
[17:33] a Pentecostal preacher and then he met
[17:36] his wife and then became the message
[17:38] came to the message of brother Branham

[30:54] which were before you praise gone let's
[30:57] read our text here tonight by God's
[31:01] grace I liked it let's just go back to
[31:04] 1st Thessalonians 5:21 I like to look at
[31:07] part 6 improve all things
[31:12] Lord willing after tonight Lord willing
[31:14] we'll be able to get now to the other
[31:15] side
[31:17] [Music]
[31:19] they'll believe the sign and those that
[31:21] have left the message but tonight I want
[31:24] to finish up on the false doctrines
[31:26] coming out of Jeffersonville so 1st
[31:31] Thessalonians 5:21 I got a text saying
[31:47] sermon 5 so Sunday's sermon was awesome
[31:50] like your balance on subjects concerning
[31:52] brother branham's that was a
[31:53] encouragement there so I said it's all
[31:56] glory to God they're all by God's grace
[32:00] that's one thing we need in this hour we
[32:02] need balance don't we by God's grace we
[32:05] don't want to be too far on one side or
[32:08] too far on the other we want to be right
[32:09] down the middle of the road 1st
[32:11] Thessalonians 5:21 let's read that on
[32:15] three one two three
[32:17] prove all things hold fast that which is
[32:21] good they got as blessings arena of his
[32:23] word may be seated here tonight I don't
[32:27] have enough slides you know I forgot
[32:29] we're gonna do service today so I didn't
[32:31] prepare enough slides so I don't have
[32:33] any slides to show today so I'll just be
[32:35] reading quotes and quoting scriptures by
[32:38] God's grace so Lord willing we went
[32:41] through the first five of the concerns
[32:45] we found how not every word brother
[32:49] Branham said was thus saith the Lord
[32:50] with and I think I did 19 examples where
[32:54] the Jose and I were talking after
[32:55] service on Sunday we had about three or
[32:57] four more I didn't get to study on those
[32:59] but I can name a few of them you know
[33:02] brother Branham said or the oh yeah okay
[33:06] I thought what you talking to me sorry
[33:07] but the random said at the end of his
[33:09] life you know that he was gonna go back
[33:11] to Jeffers Ville Jeffersonville and
[33:12] preach trail of the serpent he said is
[33:15] going to be a four-hour sermon and he
[33:17] said Billy Billy Paul will send out
[33:19] invitations and and they'll record that
[33:22] well that never happened now the the
[33:24] tape I'm sorry the return ministry
[33:26] people believe that's actually going to
[33:27] happen they still believe that that's
[33:29] why they prepare a plane to fly brother
[33:31] Branham around the
[33:32] world and ride the trail again and
[33:36] that's what they believe so they they if
[33:38] they believe every word is thus saith
[33:40] the Lord then they believe that but we
[33:42] don't believe that we believe he had
[33:44] intentions to do that but he didn't God
[33:47] didn't allow him to do that because it
[33:49] was his time to go home we believe that
[33:51] so that was one of them of course there
[33:53] was some few other ones I don't remember
[33:54] all of them that we we talked about so
[33:59] the second one first one was not every
[34:02] words thus saith the Lord second one
[34:03] they the their church promotes blind
[34:06] faith in every word brother Branham said
[34:09] and we've got to make sure that we don't
[34:11] fall into that like we said we don't
[34:13] want a critical spirit you know about
[34:14] brother Branham or Paul for that matter
[34:17] or anyone in the Bible but we've got to
[34:19] we've got to get in the habit of leaning
[34:22] upon the Holy Spirit and testing every
[34:25] word praise God and I'll say like this
[34:28] if you're born again you already do that
[34:30] because brother Branham says if you're
[34:33] born again you get a buzzer inside of
[34:35] you called discernment and any time if
[34:38] something goes against that Holy Spirit
[34:40] and tries to quench the thirst of the
[34:44] Holy Spirit but the RAM said a buzzer
[34:45] goes off to protect your life so if
[34:49] anything would try to quench that holy
[34:51] thirst or try to stop that holy thirst
[34:54] for the RAM said you got a buzzer that
[34:56] says your life's in danger your life's
[34:58] in danger and every time I listen to
[35:00] that church in Jeffersonville I always
[35:01] hear that your life's in danger your
[35:03] life's in danger the buzzer inside of me
[35:06] goes off and that's why I've been
[35:08] building up these quotes and preaching
[35:09] it repeatedly off and on to try to help
[35:13] the people that are in there so I'm
[35:15] still working on the video for the two
[35:17] sons of the Prophet and so we'll try to
[35:19] hopefully finish that by Saturday and
[35:23] that's what that's what God has given
[35:26] you the Holy Spirit for to guide you
[35:28] into all truth so the second thing is we
[35:31] do not have blind faith in every word we
[35:34] we want to respect we show honor to
[35:36] brother Branham and all God's servants
[35:38] but every word must be taken back to the
[35:41] scripture to make sure we have the right
[35:43] faith and the right understanding
[35:45] thirdly they say the tapes are the token
[35:50] they say being a tape Church is the
[35:52] token and we saw how that's not right
[35:55] the token is the baptism of the Holy
[35:58] Ghost and let me read you two quotes
[36:00] here that that help us understand that
[36:05] clearly by God's grace so here it is all
[36:18] right sorry here yeah well the RAM says
[36:23] this is the token September 1st the
[36:25] first time he preached it in
[36:26] Jeffersonville he said there it is you
[36:28] cannot perish now the life lace over it
[36:31] it's a token lays over that little body
[36:35] lays over that soul of that person so
[36:38] where does the token of the Holy Spirit
[36:40] lay over the soul there is a token over
[36:45] there the Holy Spirit that it belongs to
[36:48] God now brother man would never say my
[36:50] tapes the token they'll never say being
[36:53] a tape Church is a token I showed you on
[36:55] Sunday there's only three quotes about
[36:56] the tape Church right and they're just
[36:59] there to questions in the questions and
[37:01] answers and never does he ever say oh
[37:03] yeah listen to my tapes at home they're
[37:05] the token he doesn't say that the the
[37:08] the problem is is that the their church
[37:11] misinterprets quotes where it says the
[37:14] message of the hour you you've got the
[37:17] token the message of the hour or
[37:18] something like that
[37:19] and so we'll talk about that in a moment
[37:21] but here he says it plainly he says it
[37:24] he says the Holy Spirit belongs to God
[37:27] it's his when I see the token I'll pass
[37:29] over you a positive token the Holy
[37:32] Spirit is our token so when you when
[37:35] they make the tapes the token or tape
[37:37] Church the token they've done the same
[37:40] thing that Pentecostals have done and
[37:41] made a fleshly evidence that anybody can
[37:44] reproduce anybody can reproduce that it
[37:48] can be impersonated but the love of
[37:50] Jesus Christ of course it can be
[37:52] impersonated but it can never be done
[37:54] unless you got it praise God you got to
[37:57] have it and then you'll love your
[37:59] right then you'll love the word then
[38:01] your your life will will be
[38:03] ever-increasing into more godliness more
[38:06] obedience more love to Christ now in a
[38:11] the same year in the token in November
[38:15] of 63
[38:16] he said the token seal of the Holy
[38:18] Spirit is our promise Ephesians 4:30
[38:21] says grieve not the Holy Spirit of God
[38:23] whereby you're sealed unto the day of
[38:26] your redemption so here he says the
[38:28] token is on the soul and the token is
[38:31] the seal so now we know clearly the
[38:34] token is the seal of the Holy Ghost
[38:36] praise God it can't be anything else
[38:39] that they're saying that it was and
[38:40] church don't forget these are real
[38:42] important scriptures john 14:26 in John
[38:44] 16:13 that proved the evidence of the
[38:47] Holy Ghost is being led into all truth
[38:50] so you if you're truly born again you
[38:53] and I are born again we can learn more
[38:55] about God we can draw closer to God so
[39:00] that means a true Holy Ghost filled
[39:01] Christian won't get bored with learning
[39:03] about the Lord they don't get distracted
[39:06] and say oh I like to learn more about
[39:07] the world than I do the word they won't
[39:09] because the evidence is they want more
[39:11] of God all the time
[39:13] Eileen oh yeah they don't get bored with
[39:15] reading their Bibles or studying or
[39:17] praying or hearing preaching because the
[39:20] Holy Spirit feeds on the word praise God
[39:23] they don't they don't die spiritually
[39:26] because their buzzer says I need life I
[39:28] need more I need more I've got them I
[39:30] want to draw closer I want fellowship
[39:32] with my Lord but sees people that aren't
[39:35] born again they fall short in that area
[39:37] because jesus said the Holy Spirit will
[39:39] teach you all things and bring all
[39:42] things to remembrance whatever I've said
[39:43] unto you so the Holy Spirit will always
[39:45] point us back to the word as the token
[39:48] in John 16:13 when he the Spirit of
[39:51] Truth has come he will guide you into
[39:53] all truth he'll not speak of himself in
[39:56] other words he won't speak outside the
[39:57] word the Holy Spirit will always speak
[39:59] of the word of God amen and he will show
[40:02] you things to come amen
[40:04] thank God rubber bands prophetic words
[40:07] showed us what's to come thank God we
[40:10] know what's to come we're not confused
[40:11] about that praise God
[40:14] now I wanted to read a couple more that
[40:18] I don't think I got to on the other one
[40:21] about blind faith remember brother
[40:24] Branham said he said search it by the
[40:28] word and see if it's right the Bible
[40:29] said prove all things he said test me by
[40:32] the word he said don't the Bible say
[40:34] prove all things he said here's the time
[40:36] that everything I've said has got to be
[40:38] proven right or wrong but I said we must
[40:41] prove all things by scripture yeah I
[40:44] think I read these to you a couple weeks
[40:45] ago right last week yeah he said prove
[40:48] all things by scripture if it's contrary
[40:49] to my faith yet the scripture says so
[40:52] the scripture is right and I'm wrong
[40:54] okay so I just want to reiterate those
[40:57] to you I haven't preached those too much
[40:59] I just want to lay those in again so we
[41:01] got those okay now the next one I want
[41:06] to get to hear the next no so number six
[41:10] and I got I probably could do eight but
[41:13] I got definitely got seven the next one
[41:16] is number six that the tape boys are the
[41:19] new fivefold ministry okay so that's
[41:22] what the church that their church
[41:23] teaches the tape boys are the new
[41:26] fivefold ministry now they want people
[41:28] like me to sit down and stop preaching
[41:30] and they want me to press play that's
[41:33] what they want me to do and their new
[41:36] fivefold ministry is tape boys
[41:39] so people that go into churches and try
[41:41] to talk to people like me or you know
[41:44] they would call a demas like me they
[41:46] would call me right or a make believer
[41:48] like me they would try to send a tape
[41:50] boy in the church and just say play you
[41:53] pastor you need to play the tapes you
[41:56] can marry them bury them baptize them
[41:58] but you can't preach you what are you
[42:00] saying you're greater than the Prophet
[42:02] that that's what they would say and so
[42:04] that's their new fivefold ministry but
[42:06] let's let's read exactly what they say
[42:09] so this is from a sermon though they
[42:12] preached last year they said okay yeah
[42:17] I'm sorry here it is the correct way for
[42:20] the fivefold ministry
[42:21] Joshua's messengers remember they say
[42:24] Joshua's messengers that went into
[42:26] Jericho were taped boys brother and
[42:28] makes a quote like that but he never
[42:31] says thus saith the Lord and he never
[42:33] even takes it as far as it's like a joke
[42:36] in passing he kind of laughs about it
[42:38] and said see some tape boy slipped in
[42:40] there any kind of chuckles and there's
[42:42] anyone listen to the token lately he
[42:44] kind of chuckles at that and said uh
[42:45] some tape boy slipped in there it wasn't
[42:47] a doctrine brother branham was preaching
[42:49] but see people with the wrong spirit
[42:51] they'll listen to a tape and they'll
[42:52] make whatever they want a doctrine
[42:54] instead of they don't have the
[42:56] understanding that every word of God
[42:58] must be proven in the mouth of two or
[43:00] three witnesses and so they don't even
[43:02] have a scripture for that witness they
[43:04] only got quotes for that but we know
[43:06] we're not saved by quotes were saved by
[43:08] the word praise God although we
[43:12] appreciate all the quotes we thank God
[43:13] they're recorded we thank God for all
[43:14] the efforts to bring the tapes to
[43:16] recording the magnetic tape and mp3 now
[43:18] but every quote has got to be taken back
[43:20] to the word he said the correct way for
[43:24] the five fold
[43:25] he said Joshua's messengers tape boys
[43:28] were what the five fold ministry that
[43:30] five fold ministry went in there being
[43:32] told what to do so that's the five fold
[43:35] ministry what did the true five fold
[43:37] ministry preach so now they're the true
[43:39] five fold ministry and I'm the false
[43:41] five fold ministry he said they played
[43:47] Rahab a tape that's what the five fold
[43:50] ministry is supposed to do oh how sad
[43:54] that is how sad that is
[43:57] oh so the real five fold ministry goes
[44:00] into houses now and that and that's many
[44:02] times you'll see that the pastor at
[44:05] Jeffersonville will leave to travel and
[44:07] so the he'll cancel service and said
[44:09] don't gather in the church gather in the
[44:10] homes because they they they they're
[44:13] fulfilling quotes how Rahab let the tape
[44:16] boys come in her home so so they're
[44:19] Church if they don't gather in the
[44:20] church many Sundays they'll gather in
[44:22] homes and play the tapes and then
[44:23] they're so happy they're fulfilling this
[44:25] quote where brother BAM said Rahab
[44:28] opened her home to the tape boys case to
[44:31] see see that they're there leaning upon
[44:33] a man-made interpretation rather than
[44:35] leaning upon the Word of God so sadly
[44:39] are they
[44:40] no scripture for this there's no
[44:43] scripture to ever say that the fivefold
[44:46] ministry is going to change our church
[44:49] if you get your Bible and go to
[44:50] Ephesians 4 you and I know it doesn't
[44:54] take a smart person or intellectual
[44:57] person but you and I know that the
[45:00] fivefold ministry is what Jesus Christ
[45:03] Himself sent down from heaven to empower
[45:06] the church and he said the fivefold
[45:09] ministry is going to last in verse 12
[45:11] until the Saints are perfected in verse
[45:15] 13 until we all come in the unity of the
[45:18] faith and the knowledge of the Son of
[45:21] God unto a perfect man unto the measure
[45:24] of the stature of the fullness of Christ
[45:27] amen praise God how long does it last
[45:31] brother sister it lasts until we're
[45:33] ready for the rapture it lasts until the
[45:37] bride is rapture ready hey men cuz he's
[45:40] got so much Holy Ghost - she's got so
[45:42] much rapture and faith her faith is able
[45:44] to change your body and take her off the
[45:46] earth now that's what the word says
[45:48] you'll never see a word where Paul ever
[45:51] says stop preaching or let's we're going
[45:54] to change the fivefold ministry that's
[45:56] what we ended with on Sunday where that
[45:59] church now says revelation 22:16 means
[46:01] play tapes instead of preach but that's
[46:04] not there's no there's no other
[46:06] scripture for that all right now you
[46:10] know the Word of God Romans 10 let's go
[46:12] to Romans 10 remember without the
[46:17] fivefold ministry as returned to Rome
[46:18] instead without the fivefold ministry
[46:23] they will be tossed the Bible said to
[46:26] and fro by every wind of doctrine by the
[46:29] sleight of men by the cunning craftiness
[46:32] whereby they lie in wait to deceive so
[46:35] those that reject the true fivefold
[46:37] ministry are tossed by every wind and
[46:39] wave they can believe anything right
[46:42] they can believe every word brother Ram
[46:44] said was thus they the little they can
[46:46] believe that and before the pastor even
[46:48] said Jesus Christ said to play tapes and
[46:51] said have preachers that's what the
[46:52] pastor said before
[46:54] even read the scripture that he
[46:55] misinterpreted everybody was cheering
[46:57] beforehand see they'll believe anything
[46:59] like you don't even need a scripture a
[47:01] church if I say something there's no
[47:03] scripture by you shouldn't believe it
[47:06] you should believe it when it's in the
[47:08] word praise God now if you're if you're
[47:10] the Holy Spirit inside of you you know
[47:12] accepts it before I actually reference
[47:14] the scripture that's different I that
[47:16] just means the Holy Spirit discern it
[47:18] and yet oh I know that scripture I sense
[47:20] that I feel the spirit giving me a
[47:22] witness that that's the scripture that's
[47:24] different I'm not talking about that but
[47:26] I'm talking about their false doctrine
[47:28] and false interpretation they'll just
[47:31] receive anything right and that's where
[47:34] that's where that that second mistake is
[47:36] so evil when they have blind faith in
[47:39] every single word that means they don't
[47:41] question in it and what happens is they
[47:44] open themselves up to every demon if you
[47:48] believe every single thing then you're
[47:51] open up then you have the you let your
[47:52] guard down how did the goats get in the
[47:55] church they let the guard down
[47:56] how do demons get into people's minds
[47:59] when they let their guard down I can
[48:01] just believe anything and brother that
[48:02] Jose then they can believe brother Ram
[48:04] is going to come back and preach right
[48:05] and fly around the world they can
[48:06] believe that that they'll believe
[48:08] anything right as long as this on that
[48:12] tape they'll believe it they'll believe
[48:14] he's going to come back and he'd have to
[48:16] die and get shot by guns remember he's
[48:19] gonna have to get fired upon and the
[48:20] false church is going to kill don't
[48:22] believe anything and it opens them up to
[48:25] evil spirits but brother Aaron said
[48:28] never never clear your mind like that he
[48:30] said always keep your mind sharp always
[48:32] examine everything by the Word of God
[48:34] amen
[48:36] don't throw your filter out what would
[48:38] happen if you know you know what would
[48:40] happen church if I threw my filter out
[48:42] at my house my water would my thoughts
[48:45] will be pumping out orange rusty water
[48:47] you ever seen at our house your bird
[48:49] over to our house I have a filter in
[48:51] there I got to change it every six weeks
[48:53] well now I'm gonna try to change every
[48:54] four and it pulls out all the orange
[48:58] rust right and if not we would have
[49:02] caked orange rust
[49:03] our water would be orange we me we'd
[49:05] probably work Oh
[49:06] the orange you you cannot throughout the
[49:10] filter the filter protects your life
[49:13] amen
[49:13] in fact the worker said if you don't
[49:16] change that filter it's gonna ruin
[49:17] everything it's gonna ruin the pipes is
[49:19] going to ruin the faucets our whole
[49:22] house is gonna be ruined if we don't
[49:24] have the filter this church will be
[49:26] ruined if we don't keep the filter of
[49:27] God's Word your life your family and in
[49:31] fact that's what the brother was telling
[49:32] me and uh in Pennsylvania he said this
[49:36] false doctrine of of every word as us at
[49:40] the Lord he said it's ruining their
[49:41] family in Central America I don't want
[49:44] to cause names I don't embarrass his
[49:45] family but he was cupped they're crying
[49:47] at the altar and saying uh you know his
[49:49] wife who was you know he was he left his
[49:51] wife there in Central America to do some
[49:53] business he was crying and just saying
[49:55] she's getting pressured it and they're
[49:56] all calling programs son a prophet and
[49:59] every word is uh saith the Lord and it's
[50:01] just ripping people apart it's causing
[50:04] more fights than unity but see the Holy
[50:07] Spirit brings unity through the word
[50:09] where God's people fall in love with
[50:11] each other not fight now we got to we
[50:14] have to have a place to stand but we can
[50:16] still love one another praise God so we
[50:19] don't throw out our filter we don't open
[50:21] up our mind to just any doctrine that's
[50:24] how you're gonna get the wrong spirit
[50:27] and we'll get to that here just in a
[50:30] moment by God's grace but take boys now
[50:33] Romans 10 and I remember church that
[50:39] what they do is they they they're
[50:43] breaking the word remember they got
[50:46] fivefold ministry when they got brother
[50:47] brand they're gonna keep brother brand
[50:49] they're gonna keep their their pastor
[50:51] programs youngest son but they're gonna
[50:54] change the threefold so they change they
[50:57] change at least three offices the
[50:59] teacher I guess the pastor to I guess
[51:01] they would maybe get rid of four of them
[51:03] the Apostle all those other ones are teh
[51:06] boys no longer preachers and they've
[51:08] starting deleting the word or changing
[51:11] the word but we're not to change one
[51:13] word of it
[51:17] see because they
[51:18] quotes and then they misinterpret the
[51:20] quotes and they don't take the quotes
[51:21] back to the word we got to filter every
[51:24] quote through the Word of God that's
[51:29] right now Romans 10 look at verse 12 for
[51:34] there's no difference between the Jew
[51:36] and the Greek for the same lord over all
[51:38] is rich unto all that call upon him and
[51:40] that beautiful if you call upon God God
[51:43] is rich in mercy to you verse 13 for
[51:47] whosoever shall call on the name of the
[51:49] Lord shall be saved
[51:51] and how should they call on the name of
[51:54] him in whom they have not believed and
[51:56] how shall they believe in him of whom
[51:58] they have not heard and how shall they
[52:00] hear without a preacher not a quota or a
[52:04] tape player but a preacher and how shall
[52:07] they preach except they be sent as it is
[52:10] written how beautiful are the feet of
[52:11] them that preach the gospel of peace and
[52:13] bring glad tidings of good things
[52:16] amen but they have not all obeyed the
[52:18] gospel for Isaiah saith Lord who hath
[52:20] believed our report so then faith cometh
[52:22] by hearing and hearing by the Word of
[52:24] God the longer I live the more I
[52:26] realized I was sent to Akron to preach I
[52:29] was sent here I didn't know there was a
[52:32] city named Akron until I was seventeen
[52:34] years old and they said the coaches said
[52:35] well there's a college named Akron
[52:37] looking at you to play football
[52:39] I didn't even know it but I realized
[52:41] later God sent me here to preach the
[52:43] word because we had to find a John
[52:46] Graham we had to find a van yang right
[52:49] we had to find all these different
[52:50] believers in this area we have a place
[52:54] where God's sheep could be fed the Word
[52:56] of God how should they hear without a
[52:59] preacher and when the Bible say about
[53:04] preachers how beautiful are the feet of
[53:07] them that preach the gospel of peace
[53:09] so this this this church that bears the
[53:13] prophets name no longer sees the feet of
[53:16] preachers as a beautiful thing it's not
[53:18] a beautiful path anymore it's
[53:20] disgraceful
[53:22] it's disobedient it's make a believer
[53:25] right it's like a lot or a Judas it's
[53:28] like of course lot was a real believer
[53:29] but later on would class him as a make
[53:31] believer because he wasn't a true
[53:33] as far as the full potential of a
[53:34] believer and that's what they class it
[53:37] as like oh they these guys they just all
[53:40] got it mixed up and church no doubt some
[53:42] preachers got it mixed up lots of
[53:44] preachers got it mixed up but the real
[53:46] Bride of Christ never got it mixed up
[53:48] the real Bride of Christ has no
[53:50] condemnation
[53:51] the real Bride of Christ has been led
[53:53] more into the truth of the message as
[53:55] time has gone on that's right so we
[54:00] can't do away with these scriptures
[54:02] there's never any hint of the scriptures
[54:05] ever changing now let's look at tape a
[54:09] few date boys here quotes for a little
[54:12] bit here I got a few I want to share
[54:14] with you brother Ram said sit in the
[54:20] cool of your room and listen to the
[54:22] tapes remember that things are troops
[54:25] memory had to store them up so we're
[54:27] supposed to listen to our tapes at home
[54:29] like last night would we finished the
[54:32] breach right and then we'll start the
[54:34] first shield tomorrow night listen to
[54:36] him we're gonna listen to him and they
[54:38] direct us back to the word the Holy
[54:41] Spirit show brother man I'm a vision he
[54:43] said these tapes will go worldwide where
[54:45] people in their houses them tapes will
[54:47] fall right into the hands of the
[54:49] predestinate of God because he can
[54:51] direct the word he'll direct everything
[54:54] just exactly to its course that's the
[54:56] reason he sent me back to do this store
[54:58] up the food here he forbid me to go
[55:00] overseas praise God praise the Lord now
[55:14] so we see here now I want to read a few
[55:18] more quotes about the fivefold ministry
[55:21] letter and said there is five officers
[55:23] elected of God he said apostles prophets
[55:26] teachers pastors evangelists God did
[55:28] that man has deacons and so forth and
[55:30] everything else but God said the church
[55:32] for the perfecting of the Saints can't
[55:34] divide it so God is the one who
[55:37] established the fivefold ministry and
[55:40] how dare anybody try to divide what God
[55:43] has established
[55:44] it's a very serious thing when they
[55:47] start attacking preachers of God's Word
[55:52] Moran said the chief shepherd will bring
[55:54] the whole church including the fivefold
[55:57] ministry back to the truth by the
[55:59] messenger of this age praise God
[56:02] amen he said you can't possibly take a
[56:08] place amongst the fivefold ministry of
[56:11] Ephesians four and not take authority
[56:13] over men so the fivefold ministry is the
[56:16] authority within the church praise God
[56:22] all right well Aram said the Holy Ghost
[56:28] is to take the church over not a
[56:30] political vote of who is who he said God
[56:33] placed in the church some apostles some
[56:35] prophets some teachers evangelists
[56:38] pastors not men voted them in there but
[56:40] God placed him in there by the calling
[56:42] of the Holy Spirit prayer meetings and
[56:44] laying out of hands and staying before
[56:46] God praise God amen now here's one I
[56:53] don't
[56:54] I read this here hey oh yeah I don't
[57:01] think I read this one but Matt they
[57:02] asked brother branham in 1964 do you
[57:04] teach the bride must not attend any
[57:06] other church unless you're preaching
[57:08] there or otherwise the tabernacle no I
[57:11] don't teach that I don't believe that I
[57:13] do not believe that we've got Minister
[57:15] setting here that's scattered all around
[57:16] through the country and I believe
[57:17] they're part of that bride I believe
[57:19] that a man or woman can go to church
[57:21] anywhere they want to that teaches the
[57:22] word and I believe if they don't teach
[57:24] the whole word and you can't go to
[57:26] church any other place where they teach
[57:27] the whole word go where they teach half
[57:30] the word until you can get to where they
[57:33] teach the whole word go to church
[57:36] whatever you do do that
[57:40] praise God he said now remember go to
[57:44] church somewhere praise the Lord
[57:49] all right now we looked at those now for
[57:53] the tape boys quotes there from the
[57:55] message that token now it's clear that
[57:59] the tape boys program is referencing to
[58:03] the two witnesses that went down to
[58:04] Rahab was to get her the whole point of
[58:09] those messengers going down to get Rahab
[58:12] were to get her to follow Joshua kehm
[58:15] briefs amen to that
[58:16] and Joshua was following the Ark of the
[58:20] Covenant praise God because what took
[58:22] them in the Promised Land the Ark right
[58:25] and who handled the ark the priests so
[58:28] the tape boys were like witnessing
[58:30] people that witness and called and
[58:33] shared the word brought Rahab out by the
[58:36] blood right the doors we say the scarlet
[58:39] token and then she was to follow the ark
[58:41] or the word for her day praise God the
[58:46] tape ministry was never the highlight of
[58:48] Rahab's worship it helped her get out of
[58:51] Jericho but she had to move on past the
[58:54] messengers do you think she just filed
[58:56] those messengers around everywhere they
[58:58] went after they left Jericho
[59:01] do you think she can't right next to the
[59:03] two-tenths of the messenger boys no she
[59:07] took her place
[59:08] got married right she took her place in
[59:10] the tribe of her husband and then she
[59:12] found her place and all she just took
[59:14] her place and they all came back to
[59:16] worship at the Ark of the word praise
[59:19] God so see she moved on she went from
[59:22] Tait boy
[59:23] she was will say like this she got won
[59:26] by the tape boys but then the tape boys
[59:28] brought her to the Ark the Word of God
[59:29] and she found her position worshiping in
[59:33] the same place everybody else worship
[59:35] through the priesthood through the the
[59:37] ministry of that hour the living word
[59:39] like we're doing today praise God
[59:43] hallelujah did God say he dwell amongst
[59:48] the tape boys the two messengers no he
[59:51] said he dwelt amongst between the
[59:53] cherubims and those tape boys if they
[59:56] weren't priests they couldn't go into
[59:57] the Holy of Holies they'd have access
[59:59] they could never take her in there
[1:00:01] praise God but the priest could make
[1:00:04] intercession for the priests that were
[1:00:06] of the Ark ministry the predestinated
[1:00:09] ordained ministry that God had for that
[1:00:11] hour and today that ministry is the
[1:00:14] fivefold ministry for us praise God
[1:00:18] brother brother Jose I appreciate mother
[1:00:21] Simon he was like a tape boy he slipped
[1:00:23] in and played a tape he didn't slip in
[1:00:25] and preach at me he slipped in and press
[1:00:28] play and I heard Severin seed that's how
[1:00:31] I first heard the message so I'm
[1:00:33] grateful like Rahab thanks God I heard a
[1:00:36] tape first but the tape called me out to
[1:00:39] the real ministry praise God
[1:00:41] I wonder how sister beatrice and william
[1:00:45] did it you know i wonder did they hear
[1:00:46] our live preacher first or to the hair
[1:00:48] tape board you know sister okay

[1:01:32] one and and the title is the Lord amen
[1:01:40] so it could be book tape or live
[1:01:43] preaching it doesn't matter that the
[1:01:45] reality is God has a way to find all
[1:01:49] those that are gonna that are
[1:01:50] predestinated to it praise God beautiful
[1:01:53] stories beautiful stories see what did
[1:01:55] the tape boy ministry lead Rahab to
[1:01:58] worship with the rest of the people
[1:02:00] through the tabernacle praise God all
[1:02:09] right see all she had to do the Bible
[1:02:12] said Rahab received the spies with peace
[1:02:14] the Bible said she received the
[1:02:17] messengers so that's all God requires
[1:02:20] receive the messengers that he sends
[1:02:23] praise God that's what he required no
[1:02:26] matter which form it is but then if you
[1:02:27] get brought into the body the body is
[1:02:30] going to be United through the fivefold
[1:02:32] ministry until we all come in perfection
[1:02:34] until you all come in rapturing
[1:02:36] condition praise God
[1:02:41] beautiful that's right Rahab was right
[1:02:46] in that lineage of Matthew or of Jesus
[1:02:48] right praise God and salmon begat Boaz

[1:03:03] amen hallelujah very good now I'm just
[1:03:10] kind of flipping through here yeah I got
[1:03:15] a
[1:03:15] more yeah I didn't see some of these I
[1:03:17] forgot about some of these there's a
[1:03:19] whole lot more statements that prove but
[1:03:23] Iran was not infallible but I won't
[1:03:25] labor on those now so so let me get back
[1:03:29] to my notes here my regular notes okay
[1:03:32] so that was number six tape boys are the
[1:03:34] new fivefold ministry is there any
[1:03:37] evidence in the entire Bible where Paul
[1:03:39] ever says you know you're gonna have to
[1:03:40] stop preaching at the end time has
[1:03:42] anybody ever seen any evidence I'll say
[1:03:44] like this I charge you in Christ's name
[1:03:46] if there is you let me know I charge you
[1:03:50] because if there is we need to obey it
[1:03:54] because I don't know it I don't see Paul
[1:03:58] ever changing his gospel it's always
[1:04:02] gonna be the same and he said anybody
[1:04:03] that would change any of it is cursed so
[1:04:08] that's why we just hope and pray those
[1:04:10] who are changing it they're doing it
[1:04:12] ignorant Lee and God will have mercy on
[1:04:14] them because we don't a real Christian
[1:04:16] doesn't want to see anybody go to hell
[1:04:17] doesn't want to see anybody lost doesn't
[1:04:20] see anybody cursed okay that's number
[1:04:24] six okay now number seven is the
[1:04:29] absolute I've mentioned this over and
[1:04:31] over again but let's read some specific
[1:04:34] quotes
[1:04:39] now when bro Graham says the absolute is
[1:04:42] the message of the hour you have to
[1:04:45] understand what he means because in the
[1:04:46] rapture sermon 1965 brother man tells us
[1:04:49] what the message is brother has sent a
[1:04:51] message of this hour what they are
[1:04:54] getting at is God's promise of this hour
[1:04:57] that he promised what he would do and we
[1:05:00] see him scripturally vindicating just
[1:05:02] exactly what he said he would do in the
[1:05:04] same manner so the message is God's Word
[1:05:06] that's being fulfilled right now if used
[1:05:10] if you mean that and say oh the message
[1:05:12] is the absolute then I agree because the
[1:05:14] scripture is the absolute but if you
[1:05:18] mean every word on the tape or every
[1:05:19] word in the book is the absolute that's
[1:05:21] wrong that's not true we saw that
[1:05:23] because not every word in the books is
[1:05:25] infallible okay
[1:05:28] so that's the important scripture there
[1:05:31] to share now let me read again he says I
[1:05:37] believe this is what the church their
[1:05:39] pastor teaches I mean everything by Bram
[1:05:41] says is thus saith the Lord this message
[1:05:43] has to be my absolute yeah okay so yeah
[1:05:52] that's basically the quote there now let
[1:05:54] me read you some quotes you've probably
[1:05:56] heard before I'm brother Branham but
[1:05:57] maybe some of you haven't this is from a
[1:05:59] absolute 1963 right before the seven
[1:06:02] seals
[1:06:02] he said it's gotten to a place like it
[1:06:05] was in the days of judges everybody has
[1:06:06] their own absolutely not the truth today
[1:06:09] everybody's got their own absolute but
[1:06:12] it all fails like the Pharaohs and so
[1:06:15] forth but God's absolute is his word he
[1:06:19] gives it and heavens and earth will pass
[1:06:21] away but it shall never pass away he
[1:06:23] said I like that so Matthew 24 is Jesus
[1:06:28] is God's absolute heaven earth shall
[1:06:30] pass away my word will never pass away
[1:06:32] now look my man says you he said you and
[1:06:35] I will come to shame if the word is not
[1:06:37] our absolute now what would shame be
[1:06:40] it'd be foolish virgin that'd be
[1:06:41] shameful or even lost like Judas if the
[1:06:45] word is not your final say the last word
[1:06:47] your rock your anchor your hope your
[1:06:50] trust your faith your hope and stay then
[1:06:53] you'll come to shame so here's what he
[1:06:57] says and if your absolute is some
[1:06:59] organization or some sensation or
[1:07:02] something else besides the person of
[1:07:04] Jesus Christ you'll come to the same
[1:07:07] portion of shame only worse
[1:07:10] see if your absolute is not Christ so
[1:07:15] see your absolute has to be the person
[1:07:17] of Jesus Christ and how is he revealed
[1:07:20] he's revealed through his word so is the
[1:07:24] Holy Spirit the absolute yes is the
[1:07:27] revealed word the absolute yes is the
[1:07:29] word the absolute yes but it's the Holy
[1:07:32] Spirit's interpretation of this word all
[1:07:39] right now
[1:07:39] pretty simple he said that's the only
[1:07:41] center post of the human life and Christ
[1:07:44] is the word not your church your word
[1:07:47] the word see upon this absolutely I'll
[1:07:50] build my church upon Christ the word
[1:07:53] amen so brother now it makes it
[1:07:56] he said it makes it a synonym to the
[1:07:59] revelation right because he said upon
[1:08:01] this revelation I'll build my church
[1:08:03] but program puts the word absolute upon
[1:08:05] this absolute so it's the revelation of
[1:08:07] God's Word is your absolute today amen
[1:08:10] hallelujah upon this absolute I'll build
[1:08:14] my church and the gates of Hell will not
[1:08:17] prevail against this absolute hallelujah
[1:08:24] what we have said see he's dealt in
[1:08:27] every generation as we've studied
[1:08:29] through the Scriptures there's always
[1:08:30] one individual that he deals with
[1:08:32] because you get two men you got two
[1:08:33] opinions it's got to come to one final
[1:08:35] absolute and my absolute is the word the
[1:08:39] Bible and as pastor here the church he
[1:08:43] said my absolute is the word I know you
[1:08:45] our brothers you kind of look at me to
[1:08:48] be your absolute to what as long as I
[1:08:51] follow God as Paul said in the
[1:08:53] scriptures you follow me as I follow
[1:08:56] Christ so here's an interesting quote I
[1:09:01] want to bring this this is from church
[1:09:03] order December 26 63 brother Graham said
[1:09:07] the men in his church look to him as
[1:09:10] kind of absolute which I agree it's okay
[1:09:16] another word but brother branham is kind
[1:09:19] of like our last say on something like
[1:09:21] if I don't understand something
[1:09:22] I'll take brother branham's word we're
[1:09:24] over my thought many times okay but I'm
[1:09:27] not making brother branham equal with
[1:09:29] God I'm just saying I'm gonna just trust
[1:09:32] his opinion because he's a faithful man
[1:09:34] of God but he's not the absolute because
[1:09:38] there's only one the absolute that's the
[1:09:40] person of Christ so I call us sister
[1:09:43] Beatrice I call like this programs like
[1:09:45] a minor absolute I just say like that
[1:09:47] but the Hosea this this quote is saying
[1:09:49] he's just a human leader like Paul said
[1:09:52] in first Corinthians
[1:09:53] one be followers of me even as I also am
[1:09:57] of Christ so God gave us human preachers
[1:10:01] that we can follow and if they're the
[1:10:04] shepherd we want to be the Sheep right
[1:10:05] but we know the preachers are sheep to
[1:10:08] following the great Shepherd but God
[1:10:10] gives us a human man to follow with
[1:10:13] they're called pastors right so this is
[1:10:19] important to know about the absolute if
[1:10:22] Christ is not your absolute you'll fall
[1:10:24] into shame in your life and yes brother
[1:10:27] Ram can be like a minor absolute but the
[1:10:30] word is the major absolute like in the
[1:10:34] next week Lord willing next Wednesday if
[1:10:36] we can get to the believe the sign
[1:10:38] things I've already mentioned here about
[1:10:40] the bridge you know brother Han
[1:10:41] prophesied sixteen men fell there's no
[1:10:43] there's no newspaper articles about it
[1:10:47] some families that believed the message
[1:10:49] went and spent four months studying all
[1:10:51] the historical newspapers in
[1:10:54] Jeffersonville there's no record they
[1:10:56] left the message and cause many others
[1:10:58] to leave with them now in that case like
[1:11:00] I told you before whose word you're
[1:11:02] gonna take brother branham's word or the
[1:11:04] newspapers word so in that case I go to
[1:11:08] my minor absolute brother Jose you
[1:11:11] understand because the Bible doesn't say
[1:11:14] sixteen people were going to die right
[1:11:16] at the building of the high bridge so
[1:11:19] what am I going to take I'm gonna take
[1:11:20] the miter absolute because he taught so
[1:11:24] much of the word now say like this
[1:11:26] ninety five percent how much 98 percent
[1:11:28] of the tapes are correct you know
[1:11:29] whatever I'm just saying there's a major
[1:11:32] portion of the tapes are absolutely
[1:11:33] correct but there's a section that's
[1:11:36] human as I showed you through twenty
[1:11:39] some examples and I could do more for
[1:11:41] example let me give you another one
[1:11:42] marriage and divorce program said Jacob
[1:11:44] had at least more than twelve lives
[1:11:46] that's not true the Bible said he had
[1:11:49] four wives because Jacob's father law
[1:11:52] made him promise you won't take any more
[1:11:54] wives than the four that he had see
[1:11:58] there's another one you can't make the
[1:12:01] vow
[1:12:01] why I mean that that's foolish too to
[1:12:05] make every word thus they thought it's
[1:12:06] foolish it's a shameful thing praise God
[1:12:10] you know sit there and you know cheer
[1:12:13] and shout like they got something they
[1:12:14] haven't got nothing with their guys to
[1:12:17] open mine and they've got the wrong
[1:12:18] spear that's what they've got see now
[1:12:25] that's the point I want to make there if
[1:12:27] it comes down to brother Rams Word or
[1:12:29] some other man's word and they're gonna
[1:12:32] use this to say he's not a man of God
[1:12:34] then I'm gonna take the minor prophet
[1:12:36] miter absolute I'm gonna take the man
[1:12:39] who followed Christ in our day amen
[1:12:42] glory
[1:12:43] the man who manifested healings right
[1:12:46] like through our sister Humes praise God
[1:12:49] the man who taught the seals and they
[1:12:51] were different from any other man that
[1:12:53] have preached beforehand because they
[1:12:55] came from the person of Christ amen
[1:12:57] he didn't plagiarize Clarence Larkin he
[1:13:01] plagiarized heaven like Moses
[1:13:03] plagiarized heaven when he made the
[1:13:05] tabernacle God said make it after the
[1:13:08] pattern you've seen in the mouth praise
[1:13:10] God and the Holy Spirit said preach
[1:13:12] these seals like you've seen in the
[1:13:14] vision amen
[1:13:15] that's exactly right every Christian
[1:13:19] every prophet was plagiarizing from
[1:13:21] heaven praise God
[1:13:22] but I'm not using the word plagiarism in
[1:13:25] a negative sense now in a good sense
[1:13:27] because what good knowledge there's no
[1:13:30] man that was ever a godly man that ever
[1:13:32] made things up he tapped all of it from
[1:13:35] God the Bible said it was God breathed
[1:13:37] God breathed it down he was inspired by
[1:13:40] God the Bible said the prophets of old
[1:13:42] were moved by the Holy Ghost to write
[1:13:44] what they wrote praise God it wasn't the
[1:13:47] idea what good idea does man have what
[1:13:50] good idea that brother had to offer
[1:13:52] nothing we've seen many of his ideas
[1:13:54] he's a man I'm a man what good do any of
[1:13:57] us have our own ideas Ned but the word
[1:13:59] that he spoke from God that's our
[1:14:01] absolute praise God it's our absolute on
[1:14:05] on hair length and makeup and the
[1:14:08] fivefold ministry
[1:14:09] it's our absolute own holiness and
[1:14:11] godliness it's our absolute on
[1:14:12] everything is the word
[1:14:14] that God showed from heaven praise God
[1:14:16] because the Bible said but now God that
[1:14:18] God's Word is forever written in heaven
[1:14:21] amen
[1:14:21] it was written in heaven before is
[1:14:24] written on earth amen and we're just
[1:14:26] fortunate to be able to receive the word
[1:14:28] from heaven that God is revealed in this
[1:14:30] hour and we were so fortunate the lamb
[1:14:32] broke the seals and sent it down to
[1:14:34] earth amen hallelujah and now we can eat
[1:14:38] the open book and prophesy again
[1:14:40] hallelujah
[1:14:43] the people can't catch that they can't
[1:14:45] be born again because the book is the
[1:14:49] mystery of everything seekers even
[1:14:52] before the seals remember brother Aaron
[1:14:54] was mixing up the Baptism Holy Ghost but
[1:14:56] after the seals it's no longer a mystery
[1:14:59] it's revealed the new birth and the
[1:15:01] baptism are one of the same praise God
[1:15:03] no more confusion hey man all the
[1:15:07] mysteries finished hallelujah that's
[1:15:10] right thank the Lord
[1:15:15] now praise God what was my next thought
[1:15:22] I was gonna get to help it wasn't the
[1:15:24] tape boys I already preached that one
[1:15:26] there oh yeah yeah yeah yeah okay thank
[1:15:33] you thanks for patience your house had
[1:15:34] to wait upon the Lord here okay the
[1:15:38] absolute I hope you understand I think
[1:15:45] you do I've mentioned it enough but I
[1:15:47] just want to read those quotes clearly
[1:15:48] so you can see it and then I wrote and
[1:15:51] said every believer can be the voice of
[1:15:53] God if you get so possessed he said with
[1:15:58] the Holy Spirit and you speak what God
[1:16:00] tells you to speak or just open your
[1:16:01] mouth and God start speaking you become
[1:16:03] the voice of God is there one prophetic
[1:16:06] voice yes the seven church age messenger
[1:16:08] the prophet of God Malachi 4 but each
[1:16:11] person can be a minor voice of God -
[1:16:15] okay God's absolute his word okay all
[1:16:17] right now number eight I would just call
[1:16:20] this the eighth problem is they just our
[1:16:22] name calling us right we've been called
[1:16:24] demas because Dimas Dimas left Paul and
[1:16:27] so they're saying Oh
[1:16:28] still preach they've left Paul for the
[1:16:32] cares and all the blessings of this
[1:16:33] world now no doubt some did like there's
[1:16:36] no no no doubt no doubt there's many
[1:16:37] preachers that have made hundreds of
[1:16:39] thousands of millions of dollars just by
[1:16:41] passing a message Church and they stop
[1:16:43] preaching the truth because they got
[1:16:44] tempted by money no doubt but not all of
[1:16:48] them not the real faithful ones praise
[1:16:51] God so no doubt there are some preachers
[1:16:54] I didn't do Adiemus they left the true
[1:16:56] preachings of brother Graham to
[1:16:57] compromise on God's Word but not the
[1:17:00] real ones and they call us make believer
[1:17:03] because we're not sure to be play tapes
[1:17:05] or not should the pastor preach is it'll
[1:17:07] be he'll be called lazy if he doesn't
[1:17:09] preach so that's a make believer so
[1:17:12] that's not true we're not and then we
[1:17:15] saw on Sunday we are called ears that
[1:17:18] can't hear that's what they were called
[1:17:21] because we can't understand that
[1:17:24] revelation 22:16 is saying play tapes in
[1:17:27] your church nonsense nonsense now here's
[1:17:32] the whole root of it Church here's the
[1:17:34] whole root of it and they were warned
[1:17:36] over and over again we're warned in the
[1:17:37] scripture the Bible says in first John
[1:17:41] 5:21 the Bible says little children keep
[1:17:45] yourselves from idols why would John
[1:17:49] spend this whole thing this whole book
[1:17:52] writing about love love love love love
[1:17:54] and is very some of his very last words
[1:17:57] keep yourselves from idols see because
[1:18:02] he was dealing with if you've got the
[1:18:04] love of God in your heart you're not
[1:18:06] going to love the things of the world
[1:18:07] the love of God is going to drive you
[1:18:09] deeper in love with Christ but if you
[1:18:12] don't get the love of God if you don't
[1:18:14] get born again you're gonna love an idol
[1:18:16] so that proves any person that believes
[1:18:19] these lies that we've been we've been
[1:18:21] preaching against they're not born again
[1:18:23] because they're a part of idolatry and
[1:18:25] idolaters were not inherit the kingdom
[1:18:27] of God and it's proven right there in
[1:18:31] Scripture I mean it's the last word yeah
[1:18:33] it's the last worse little children keep
[1:18:35] yourselves from idols amen so be it
[1:18:40] the the prophet of love we call him
[1:18:42] because he was a prophet st. John the
[1:18:44] Divine
[1:18:44] he ends that first but yes it's the last
[1:18:47] words 521 little children keep
[1:18:49] yourselves from idols so the God the man
[1:18:52] that knew all about the love the man
[1:18:54] that laid in Jesus bosom it says don't
[1:18:56] don't lay in any other bosom don't lay
[1:18:58] in Brother Rams bosom right remain in
[1:19:04] the bosom of Christ remain in the word
[1:19:06] of God so what is the root the whole
[1:19:12] root of this is idolatry and idolatry
[1:19:17] will keep many people out of heaven
[1:19:20] let's go to first Corinthians 10 again
[1:19:23] just to kind of reiterate this first
[1:19:36] Corinthians 10 now Paul goes through all
[1:19:43] the faults of Israel on their road to
[1:19:45] the promised land you know you remember
[1:19:48] fornicators I doubt there's of course
[1:19:50] we're gonna look at that now that they
[1:19:52] murmured all these things look at verse
[1:19:56] 12 wherefore let him that thinketh he
[1:19:58] standeth take heed lest he fall so see
[1:20:01] we got to be constant by the hose Amy
[1:20:02] I'll be looking at our lives that God
[1:20:03] keep me from falling I know there's
[1:20:08] there's lions seeking to devour me
[1:20:10] I know Satan is shooting fiery darts at
[1:20:14] me Lord keep me from falling I don't
[1:20:17] want to fall into sin how many think
[1:20:21] you're standing how many are standing
[1:20:23] for Christ here tonight well you better
[1:20:25] take heed lest you fall see Paul never
[1:20:28] says I I'm so mature I never fall he
[1:20:32] never says it like that that's boasting
[1:20:35] that's pride but he said if you think
[1:20:39] you're standing take heed lest you fall
[1:20:41] verse 13 there hath no temptation taken
[1:20:44] you but such as is common to man but God
[1:20:46] is faithful who will not suffer you to
[1:20:48] be tempted above that ye are able but
[1:20:50] will with the temptation also make a way
[1:20:52] to escape that you
[1:20:54] may be able to bear it wherefore my
[1:20:57] dearly beloved flee from idolatry I
[1:21:02] speak as to wise men judgey what I say
[1:21:10] remember church when Moses left the
[1:21:13] scene the Bible says what they did in
[1:21:15] verse 7 the people sat down to eat and
[1:21:19] drink and rose up to play when the
[1:21:22] Prophet all that's perfect for right now
[1:21:23] the Prophet left the scene right Moses
[1:21:25] left up into glory the cloud he left up
[1:21:29] in the cloud the cloud of witnesses and
[1:21:33] what the people do they made themselves
[1:21:34] an idol because they weren't in Jordan
[1:21:37] there they won't they won't they weren't
[1:21:39] crossed over Jordan right
[1:21:40] they weren't burned again they weren't
[1:21:43] circumcised like josh was going to
[1:21:45] circumcise them praise God so they ate
[1:21:48] and drank and rose up to play see same
[1:21:52] thing idolatry in church did you know
[1:21:55] even Jesus Christ had to battle idolatry
[1:21:57] Satan didn't even leave him out of it
[1:22:00] say and said here's all the kingdoms if
[1:22:03] you just bow down and worship me I'll
[1:22:05] give them to you right now so even our
[1:22:09] Lord Jesus he was tempted brother and
[1:22:11] said it was one of the hardest
[1:22:12] temptations right I'd like to have
[1:22:15] control right now I'd like to rule with
[1:22:17] the rod of iron right now I'd like to be
[1:22:19] in control but yeah he had to overcome
[1:22:21] that and he had to resist that spirit of
[1:22:23] idolatry see there's something in a man
[1:22:26] or woman right I just want to fall down
[1:22:28] and make it easy and worship something
[1:22:30] to make it easy rather than hanging on
[1:22:33] it and being true to God right so Satan
[1:22:36] tapped into that we're human want to
[1:22:38] just see that's what the people there in
[1:22:40] jeffersonville do they want to it's the
[1:22:42] easy way out just to say every word as I
[1:22:44] say though that's the easy way out they
[1:22:46] don't to answer questions I think you
[1:22:49] just say I believe what's on it and I
[1:22:50] got blind faith in it and I just believe
[1:22:53] it that settles it you know whatever
[1:22:54] they say prophet said it I believe it
[1:22:56] that settles it well yeah if it's thus
[1:22:58] saith the Lord if it's in the word but
[1:23:01] not every word so see they're taking the
[1:23:03] easy way out there's one a bow down and
[1:23:05] let someone take their worship
[1:23:07] instead of letting a christ change their
[1:23:10] hearts to help them to trusting Christ
[1:23:13] to understand the word not to trust in a
[1:23:17] man
[1:23:18] idolatry keeps many people out of heaven
[1:23:21] member those two tribes Dan and Ephraim
[1:23:23] their names are blotted out under heaven
[1:23:25] because of idolatry praise God
[1:23:36] program said anything that stands
[1:23:38] between you and God is an idol it takes
[1:23:41] the place of God but they have said
[1:23:47] you'll worship your pleasure
[1:23:49] you'll worship something because it's in
[1:23:51] mankind to worship that's why they've
[1:23:53] got to be careful we don't get too
[1:23:54] involved with the pleasures of life
[1:23:56] right we got to be careful we don't fall
[1:23:59] too much in love with you know
[1:24:01] technology or whatever food you know
[1:24:06] cares of the world things of the world
[1:24:08] riches you know we can't because
[1:24:11] whenever we take pleasure wherever we
[1:24:13] have the happiest and the best feelings
[1:24:15] that's what we're gonna worship if you
[1:24:17] have to make sure we bring the right
[1:24:18] attitudes here praise God we should have
[1:24:21] written of the the pleasure of a
[1:24:23] Christian is serving God in the house of
[1:24:25] the Lord
[1:24:26] that's the pleasure because whenever
[1:24:28] your greatest pleasure is in that's what
[1:24:31] you worship you worship your pleasure he
[1:24:38] said but when you make something your
[1:24:40] God when that's what you're depending on
[1:24:43] he says and then it's got to perish
[1:24:45] anything that perishes and that's a god
[1:24:48] it's it's wrong you can't depend on that
[1:24:52] we have to depend on something that
[1:24:53] won't perish that's the Word of God
[1:24:56] praise God but man stirred the
[1:25:02] world is full of idolatry idolatry is
[1:25:05] when something is placed in front of God
[1:25:10] praise the Lord
[1:25:11] now look what brother Aaron says he said
[1:25:14] the Catholic Church come out and made
[1:25:16] plain made it a plain Idol so at least
[1:25:20] the Catholics admit though they at least
[1:25:22] they bow down and kiss the statues but
[1:25:25] brother Aaron said the Protestants
[1:25:27] didn't do statues but remember the
[1:25:29] Protestant making an organization and
[1:25:32] it's just as bad because it denies the
[1:25:34] word that's what I believe it's happened
[1:25:37] in Jeffersonville now they might say the
[1:25:39] same thing about me
[1:25:40] but when they take their own creeds and
[1:25:43] take things that break the word of God
[1:25:44] like they get rid of the fivefold
[1:25:45] ministry or they exalt by the RAM and
[1:25:47] say every words infallible they've made
[1:25:49] a denomination and that is worse than
[1:25:53] the statues that's what Bob Ram says I'm
[1:25:56] sorry no just as bad rather I'm sorry
[1:25:58] just a man it's just as bad it's equal
[1:26:00] so the Devils laughing on both sides
[1:26:02] right he's laughing at the Catholics
[1:26:04] they're worshipping statues he's
[1:26:06] laughing at denominations because
[1:26:08] they're worshipping creeds and Jesus
[1:26:11] said in vain do they worship me in other
[1:26:13] words he's saying get back to the word
[1:26:14] you can only worship through the Word of
[1:26:16] God amen
[1:26:20] having a form of godliness but denying
[1:26:23] the power thereof that's right
[1:26:31] pleasures are often idols right any
[1:26:35] pleasure of the world
[1:26:42] do you remember Church in second kings
[1:26:46] 18:4 remember the brass serpent remember
[1:26:50] the brass serpent was once used for
[1:26:51] divine healing but after generations it
[1:26:54] became an object of worship second kings
[1:26:58] 18:4
[1:26:59] and he removed the high places and break
[1:27:01] the images and cut down the groves and
[1:27:03] breaking pieces the brazen serpent that
[1:27:06] Moses had made front of those days the
[1:27:08] children of Israel did burn incense to
[1:27:10] it and they called it he called it in a
[1:27:12] hushed an so can you imagine the
[1:27:15] brazen serpent imagined by the Prophet
[1:27:18] once held this people got here but after
[1:27:30] a while they started praying to that
[1:27:32] they started trusting in that right and
[1:27:36] so Hezekiah to come around so you don't
[1:27:38] burn prayers to the bracelet the brass
[1:27:41] serpent
[1:27:41] so he went install this this this
[1:27:44] beautiful artifact he went stopped
[1:27:47] instead it's just a thing of brass
[1:27:48] that's what nahusha means there's no
[1:28:00] virtue programs by Bors desk you can't
[1:28:03] lay your hands on the desk and get
[1:28:04] something out of that you're not there's
[1:28:06] no virtue in that there's only virtue in
[1:28:08] the Holy Spirit so any gift of God
[1:28:13] brother Brown says can become an idol if
[1:28:15] we're not careful but God will not share
[1:28:20] his glory with anyone or anything and I
[1:28:23] believe that's why this is happening why
[1:28:25] were having this huge divine this mass
[1:28:27] exodus out of the message I believe
[1:28:32] that's why we're having I got just got a
[1:28:33] couple more minutes here bear with me
[1:28:35] that's the reason because God has to yes
[1:28:37] to separate all those who truly want to
[1:28:40] worship Christ from all those who want
[1:28:42] to worship brother Branham that's why
[1:28:45] it's happening right believe the sign is
[1:28:49] helping us because they're showing us
[1:28:50] brother I'm Hugh manatee the
[1:28:52] jeffersonville is showing us what it's
[1:28:54] like to go to the extreme but the true
[1:28:55] bride will straight stay right in the
[1:28:57] middle of the road and they'll realize
[1:28:59] the brother brands not getting any glory
[1:29:01] he said he gets honor like all
[1:29:03] Christians get honor but he's not gonna
[1:29:05] get the glory the glory goes to Christ
[1:29:07] Jesus the church as time goes on we find
[1:29:15] out more and more about people right
[1:29:16] like Martin Luther he said awful things
[1:29:18] about Jews I was reading it this week he
[1:29:20] said awful things about Jews tohey he
[1:29:24] said in one letter to burn down their
[1:29:26] houses a man of God
[1:29:29] you know John Wesley he had a very bad
[1:29:33] marriage you know that he did not treat
[1:29:35] his wife very good and there was
[1:29:36] questions that he was he was so good
[1:29:38] friends with some other women in the
[1:29:39] ministry there was questions around him
[1:29:41] like what and the letters from him and
[1:29:43] his wife back and forth show there
[1:29:45] wasn't much of a relationship there and
[1:29:47] there's questions what kind of yet he
[1:29:49] get up at 4 a.m. and preachy all those
[1:29:50] sermons but it says closest friends were
[1:29:53] women that weren't his wife yet he was a
[1:29:57] true church a messenger see his time
[1:30:01] goes on see God is going to make sure
[1:30:04] that we see the human human part of
[1:30:07] people that we don't worship a man but
[1:30:10] we worship Jesus Christ
[1:30:11] Jesus Christ must increase praise God
[1:30:14] that's one thing we want in this church
[1:30:16] for all of us that fall more in love
[1:30:19] with Christ Jesus amen oh my see the
[1:30:32] Bible says he that plants and waters
[1:30:33] there they're not anything the Bible
[1:30:35] says that 1st Corinthians 3 the Bible
[1:30:38] said he that plants and waters are one
[1:30:40] but it's God who gives the increase
[1:30:42] brother Ram could not have any fruit to
[1:30:44] his ministry unless God gave him the
[1:30:46] increase praise God so that's why they
[1:30:50] can't get too excited about brother
[1:30:52] Brandon we love brother Ram we thank the
[1:30:54] Lord forum but brother Branham cannot
[1:30:56] give increase only God can give increase
[1:30:58] he did his part
[1:31:00] thank God like st. Paul st. John they
[1:31:02] did their part but only God can give the
[1:31:04] increase only God can give life I hope
[1:31:08] that's understood church I hope you
[1:31:10] understand and if I get misunder
[1:31:15] good then just please come ask me mercy
[1:31:17] I I'll try to take any question I can
[1:31:22] Lorraine said you can make an idol out
[1:31:25] of your church you can make an idol out
[1:31:27] of your pastor well I make so many
[1:31:30] mistakes I don't think you'd idolize me
[1:31:33] you can make an idol out of evangelist
[1:31:35] I'm afraid that that's what a whole lot
[1:31:37] is being done they idolize the man no
[1:31:42] matter who he is if he's God's servant
[1:31:44] respect them all the same everyone don't
[1:31:47] have one above another and favorites but
[1:31:52] how many people do we know that they
[1:31:53] have favorite preachers but the man who
[1:32:00] said don't never trust some man he said
[1:32:03] I don't care who he is if he's a holy
[1:32:04] man if there's no such thing let me
[1:32:06] crack that there's no holy man
[1:32:07] there's no holy church there's no such
[1:32:09] thing it's a holy God not a holy man
[1:32:11] it's the Holy Ghost not the holy man but
[1:32:14] the Holy Spirit working in that man the
[1:32:17] man will fail he's a failure to begin
[1:32:19] with anybody the greatest of men falls
[1:32:22] don't never put your confidence in some
[1:32:24] or makes a man your example look to God
[1:32:27] Christ is your example ah hallelujah
[1:32:42] now here's that story Church I mentioned
[1:32:43] a few months ago 1954 but man so there's
[1:32:46] a little lady who found his picture of
[1:32:50] the pillar of fire and bought a frame
[1:32:52] from a 10-cent store she was in the
[1:32:54] hospital and she was looking not at me
[1:32:57] of course but at the pillar of fire and
[1:32:59] this is her testimony the doctor gave
[1:33:01] her up to die she claimed that the
[1:33:02] pillar of fire come out of the picture
[1:33:04] and hung over her two days later she was
[1:33:08] dismissed from the hospital went home
[1:33:09] well see it was just her contact she
[1:33:14] just looked at that and believed now we
[1:33:16] know to look at that any other way would
[1:33:20] be idolatry see it's not the picture it
[1:33:23] what it represents he said you
[1:33:25] understand that so she looked at that
[1:33:28] picture so much so that pillar of fire
[1:33:30] became real according her testimony
[1:33:32] hovered over her now brother Bram didn't
[1:33:34] hover over her the Holy Spirit hovered
[1:33:36] over her but she said if he were if she
[1:33:41] were looked at that picture and just
[1:33:43] looked at how I loved brother Branham
[1:33:44] said would have been idolatry I just
[1:33:50] want to read that again so you're aware
[1:33:51] of that memorable Ram
[1:33:58] said shadrach meshach and abednego had
[1:34:00] to stand before that Idol right if they
[1:34:05] didn't do it they'd be persecuted that's
[1:34:08] the way the Gentile church was brought
[1:34:10] in that's the way the Gentile church
[1:34:12] will be taken out
[1:34:15] he said notice I hope you get this
[1:34:17] Daniel was silent letting they letting
[1:34:20] them they had to make their own choice
[1:34:22] in the day of going out the Gentile
[1:34:25] dispensation there'll be an image and
[1:34:26] everybody will have to bow before this
[1:34:28] image and do worship though be holy as
[1:34:31] ever you're not to worship an image
[1:34:33] image worship remember the Bible said
[1:34:37] King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and
[1:34:39] worship Daniel in Daniel 246 after
[1:34:43] Daniel told me the vision they're all
[1:34:44] his dreams the Bible said he fell down
[1:34:46] and worshiped Daniel and the Bible said
[1:34:50] he commanded there should be an oblation
[1:34:52] and sweet odours unto Daniel see how it
[1:34:56] is the prayers see the prayers how
[1:34:58] they're going to Daniel see how the
[1:35:00] prayers were going to that brass serpent
[1:35:10] the RAM said this and another possessing
[1:35:12] the gate of his enemy in 1964 the
[1:35:14] Gentile race was brought in under the
[1:35:17] false side of worshipping an image of a
[1:35:18] man's the days of Daniel they came in
[1:35:20] worshipping that man image it goes out
[1:35:22] the same way when people will be forced
[1:35:25] to worship images of people it come in
[1:35:30] by revelation of Daniel being able to
[1:35:32] interpret the word that was written on
[1:35:34] the handwriting on the wall that's the
[1:35:36] way it come in that's the way it goes
[1:35:37] out the same way of the image of the
[1:35:40] Gentile hallelujah
[1:35:51] I think I'll stop there let's the end of
[1:35:53] our feet by God's grace I think I'll
[1:35:54] stop there is about 8:35 okay good
[1:35:56] praise the Lord
[1:36:10] case you pull up one real quick here
[1:36:12] first Corinthians 6:12 I had this in my
[1:36:15] notes here I think it comes down to this
[1:36:22] you know we are all under a certain
[1:36:24] power robe and said you're gonna leave
[1:36:27] the church fill with something and we
[1:36:30] wanted to be leaving filled with the
[1:36:32] Holy Ghost
[1:36:33] this scripture helped me overcome
[1:36:34] tobacco and cigarettes but I always look
[1:36:36] at it all things are lawful to me but
[1:36:38] all things are not expedient all things
[1:36:39] are lawful for me but I will not be
[1:36:41] brought under the power of anything see
[1:36:45] you and I must make sure we're always
[1:36:46] under the power of the Holy Spirit right
[1:36:50] now that church in Jeffersonville
[1:36:51] they're under the power of a spirit of
[1:36:52] idolatry because you can't say every
[1:36:55] word he says is thus saith the Lord and
[1:36:56] not be under idolatry you can't it's
[1:36:58] impossible you can't change the word and
[1:37:02] make brother Brandon the absolute equal
[1:37:05] to the word without being under the
[1:37:07] spirit of idolatry now you and I as we
[1:37:13] close here you and I are probably not
[1:37:15] gonna get tempted by that spirit right
[1:37:18] but what could we get tempted by to make
[1:37:21] an idol what could we that's what we
[1:37:23] need to talk to the Lord about now if
[1:37:25] we're standing today Paul said take heed
[1:37:27] if you stand lest you fall we don't want
[1:37:31] to fall into any other idolatry we don't
[1:37:33] take any pleasure right in anything
[1:37:35] outside of Jesus Christ let's bow our
[1:37:38] heads here children if you come to the
[1:37:41] instruments here now remember what
[1:37:48] brother Graham said he said mothers when
[1:37:49] you're serving your children you're
[1:37:51] serving Christ right so when we have
[1:37:53] when we have love with our children and
[1:37:55] we have we have love in our homes that's
[1:37:58] not idol worship because it's God
[1:38:01] letting us enjoy those things Solomon
[1:38:04] call them the fruits of life enjoy the
[1:38:06] fruits of life so remember God will
[1:38:08] bring everything into judgment right
[1:38:14] let's ask the law
[1:38:15] to help us to see make sure we're
[1:38:20] standing because we do not want to fall
[1:38:23] [Music]
[1:38:26] let's just examine ourselves you know
[1:38:28] you know this morning I preached at the
[1:38:30] middle school and looked at that
[1:38:31] scripture examine ourselves whether we
[1:38:33] be in the faith oh it's always a great
[1:38:39] need a new church I examine our lives
[1:38:42] [Music]
[1:38:43] let's ask that question what pleasure
[1:38:47] are we running after we should be
[1:38:49] running out for the pleasures of serving
[1:38:53] God worshiping God and I got a fresh
[1:39:01] reminder Church I'm going to turn here
[1:39:02] roughly to feedings 5 remember Paul said
[1:39:06] the be not drunk on wine but be filled
[1:39:09] with the spirit number the very next
[1:39:11] verse so the first verse he mentions
[1:39:13] about being filled with all he goes is
[1:39:15] singing fusions 5:19 speaking to
[1:39:18] yourselves in Psalms and hymns and
[1:39:21] spiritual songs singing and making
[1:39:23] melody in your heart to the Lord
[1:39:26] let's make sure our pleasures and
[1:39:29] singing at home worshiping at home
