[36:32] victory this morning Lord or a major one
[36:34] we give you glory in Jesus Christ in the
[36:36] terrset may God bless you to be in
[36:38] severe appraisal
[36:39] okay it's me Joe over sir I'd like to
[36:45] just briefly use questions and answers
[36:46] I'm gonna set a timer so make sure I
[36:48] don't go to Mel on these I should
[36:50] appreciate pushes answers let's try to
[36:52] do ten minutes by the grace of Lord I
[36:55] got five questions first one is will the
[36:58] beast be a literal visible form at the
[37:01] last battle in Revelation and this
[37:04] person said my understanding is yes my
[37:07] answer is I do not know how so that's
[37:10] what I'm saying I don't know I don't
[37:12] know if the beast is visible to humans
[37:14] during this battle or not I can't say
[37:16] the Beast will be visible to Jesus
[37:18] deceives to Jesus will take that beast
[37:20] and the false prophet and throw them in
[37:22] the lake of fire and just technically
[37:25] the Beast is not at the last battle
[37:28] young and may god it's actually a
[37:30] Armageddon
[37:31] these are the second to last battle just
[37:33] so you know but that's a wonderful
[37:34] question you appreciate that the Beast
[37:36] gets cast like a fire revelation 19 19
[37:40] to 20 no doubt though the false prophet
[37:43] will be visible to other
[37:44] humans - that's he's the man or hope
[37:46] that holds the office of the Antichrist
[37:50] he was all himself above all that is
[37:51] called God we do know they st. John saw
[37:54] the beasts a ptarmigan by vision great
[37:57] question
[37:57] I don't know visibly remember the beasts
[37:59] no man said is always wrong remember the
[38:03] four beasts of the powers you know so I
[38:05] don't know if that spear of Rome will be
[38:07] visible or not I'm not sure but one
[38:09] thing for sure it'll be visible to Jesus
[38:10] and he'll take care amen I don't know
[38:13] the first question I don't know the
[38:14] answer the first question the second one
[38:17] is boy this is a tough one right good
[38:20] question
[38:20] can a woman divorce her husband if he
[38:22] has had fornication and didn't tell her
[38:25] because we know if a woman doesn't
[38:27] confess she can be put away and he can
[38:30] marry again only the man though it
[38:33] my understanding is no so I agree with
[38:36] this person's question I agree I don't
[38:38] believe she could because it seems Jesus
[38:41] only gave the man a right to divorce
[38:43] remarry her unconfessed fornication
[38:46] program emphasizes that in marriage and
[38:48] divorce if you listen to that he said
[38:50] notice him not her causes him not her
[38:53] and that's because of Eve was the cause
[38:56] of all the Sid she fell she was deceived
[38:58] in the beginning so I agree I don't I do
[39:01] not believe a woman could remarry if
[39:05] that was the case and my man puts this
[39:08] jesus said by saying to us what's
[39:10] whosoever shall put away his wife saying
[39:12] to the common support occasion causes
[39:13] her brother have says not him to commit
[39:16] adultery so it's only him
[39:18] and he said that's because of Christ and
[39:19] the type of the Old Testament one man
[39:22] with many wives now in our day in the
[39:24] New Testament one man cannot have many
[39:26] wives you maybe have one or maybe two if
[39:28] there's none confess said if he's a
[39:30] widower then he could have another wife
[39:31] but it's not like the days of David and
[39:33] Solomon when they had thousands or a
[39:36] thousand or 100 lives and occupies it's
[39:38] not like that and whosoever shall marry
[39:40] her that is divorced committeth adultery
[39:42] here's the exact quote the better but to
[39:45] get this marriage of the most rate up so
[39:47] that you would know which was right
[39:48] which is wrong now he played these shows
[39:50] here in the types there's one Christ and
[39:52] many members that wife notice he can put
[39:54] us away for spiritual fornication with
[39:56] Bob doctrine
[39:57] anytime he wants to my man brother I'm
[40:00] sure at the time the man can put away
[40:01] the woman anytime he wants to he said
[40:05] but how dare you try to put him away
[40:07] what church can put Christ away or
[40:09] divorce Christ none right that's what
[40:12] he's saying that's the type how can we
[40:14] put away Christ and make it the man to
[40:16] put away his wife and marry another one
[40:17] but not the woman to put away her
[40:19] husband and marry another one okay so
[40:21] that's what the problem God teaches us
[40:23] and I know that that's hard I know
[40:25] I don't can't explain everything but
[40:27] that's just God's pattern that's one way
[40:29] to do it see all the shadows and types
[40:32] they're perfectly balanced up not a
[40:33] little bit the man each time that's why
[40:35] I never said anything against the man
[40:37] doing it it's always the woman that's
[40:38] exactly now I want to put this to
[40:42] sisters though to have the option of
[40:45] leaving an ungodly husband the Bible
[40:48] says that thinking but they can never
[40:50] remarry another man while their first
[40:52] husband is alive to understand that like
[40:54] we would like we wouldn't expect a woman
[40:57] who's being abused to stay in that and
[40:59] continue to be abused I don't believe
[41:01] that could be the Spirit of God these
[41:02] heard be abused and bruised that so form
[41:05] like that we couldn't believe that be
[41:06] the Spirit of God if he believed would
[41:08] be wise for her to leave and stay
[41:11] unmarried to anyone because the Bible
[41:14] says this for the woman which had the
[41:15] husband is bound by the law her husband
[41:18] so long as he liveth but if the husband
[41:21] be dead she is loosed the law of her
[41:23] husband so then if while her husband
[41:24] later she married another man she should
[41:26] be called an adulteress but if her
[41:28] husband be dead she is free from that
[41:29] law so that she's no adulteress though
[41:31] she be married to another man and so
[41:34] here's where the Bible said a woman can
[41:35] lean looking come and eat but a man
[41:39] woman can't marry under every
[41:40] circumstance just fornication and unto
[41:44] the married I command yet not i but the
[41:46] Lord so the Lord is commanding this let
[41:50] not the wife depart from her husband but
[41:51] and if she depart so Paul says she may
[41:54] depart let her remain unmarried so she
[41:57] cannot remarry again if she needs your
[41:59] husband or be reconciled to her husband
[42:02] she has two choices and let not the
[42:04] husband put away his wife as God leads
[42:07] to divorce right now just so you know I
[42:11] firstly though a minister who had a
[42:12] situation like the one this question
[42:14] described he prayed and God felt or felt
[42:17] God gave him permission to allow the
[42:19] woman to remarry and he remarried the
[42:20] woman but I personally do not agree with
[42:23] that decision that wasn't in my
[42:24] situation but I've never been in that
[42:27] situation before so I'm not judging the
[42:28] brother I'm not judging from the obligee
[42:30] that that's my conviction I agree with
[42:33] that question I do not believe a sister
[42:35] [Music]
[42:40] okay every ok with that by God's grace
[42:42] and these may cause more questions so
[42:44] get more questions email me or write on
[42:47] the paper they're happy together
[42:48] third question women cannot preach but
[42:51] can't they have another office in the
[42:53] church women may have the nine Offices
[42:56] of the spiritual gifts they may have any
[42:58] of those nine offices but not church
[43:00] government and preaching offices like
[43:02] the fivefold ministry deacon and trustee
[43:03] they can have the nine offices of
[43:06] spiritual fit that's their office
[43:08] because the Bible said in first Timothy
[43:10] I'm gonna skip down here speaking of a
[43:13] pastor or Bishop for command no ha not
[43:15] know how to rule his own house how she
[43:17] take care of the Church of God so a man
[43:20] is called to take care of the house of
[43:21] God and the Bible said when they call
[43:23] deacons the Bible said they chose seven
[43:26] ministries women I know a lot of
[43:29] churches have deaconesses today but you
[43:31] won't find that the scripture 5/7 a
[43:35] don't want the Holy Ghost 8-minute they
[43:38] were called to be divas and we're
[43:41] looking for some as well feels that a
[43:43] man that who's not even here yet
[43:44] music qualification our bylaws you can
[43:47] yourself I think is do a lot of work
[43:48] like it's beating the floor or traveling
[43:52] to get guest ministers or anything like
[43:53] that any help of any individual the
[43:56] Deacons can use here's where the women
[44:01] can have spiritual gifts you know Philip
[44:02] was an evangelist
[44:03] you had four daughters which to
[44:05] prophesize it so we have four daughters
[44:07] had to get into prophecy under like to
[44:09] be part of that church I would have that
[44:11] be wonderful
[44:12] here the prophecy going to church might
[44:14] that be a special tape praise the Lord
[44:16] and here's our momentum states at
[44:19] plainly the Patmos vision 1961 wanted to
[44:23] know if it was wrong
[44:24] for women to testify over single Jim
[44:25] messages and tongues interpret the
[44:28] messages support a prophecy in the
[44:31] church no it isn't wrong it's as long as
[44:34] it comes is placed in order why don't
[44:37] you see it which are just an order and
[44:38] only way the real true way to do it is
[44:41] for those who speak with tongues I talk
[44:42] about women giving tongues
[44:43] interpretations as we know he said but
[44:45] women are gifted with prophesy and
[44:49] gifted with tongues interpretations and
[44:51] everything but being preachers
[44:53] everything but being preachers they're
[44:55] not to be preachers they're forbidden
[44:56] fruits in the churches that's right to
[44:58] take the place or being a teacher
[44:59] anything in the church but as for gifts
[45:03] a woman has all those how many like that
[45:05] it has all those nine gifts I like that
[45:07] and can occupy one or any of those 19
[45:10] spiritual gifts according to first
[45:13] Corinthians 12 and it's under no bondage
[45:16] that her message should not come forth
[45:17] in its place praise God
[45:19] Lori you see each message waits portside
[45:22] I talks about how the tongues
[45:24] interpretation have to wait one at a
[45:26] time at most three during a service
[45:27] right then when he's finished at best
[45:31] just begin another then just before it's
[45:33] always ordered but a woman does have the
[45:35] right how many can say mininet a school
[45:38] fourth question do we make eyes on our
[45:41] gross or net income good question I
[45:44] looked up gross and net and I couldn't
[45:47] find any colds are there so here's how I
[45:50] live my life I'm just letting you know
[45:51] this is hardly remember the pastor's the
[45:53] examples of the flock so you can choose
[45:55] the column example or not it's up to you
[45:57] but the Bible said their pastors are
[45:59] given for it and sample under the
[46:02] I paid eyes on my gross income and then
[46:05] I pay offering from each paycheck
[46:06] because we're not to rob god of ties or
[46:08] offerings the church said so gross is
[46:12] your mouth before taxes there's a
[46:14] certain amount that's a it's a thousand
[46:15] dollars before tax let's say you take
[46:17] over 700 your net is your 700 you take
[46:20] home the gross should be the thousand
[46:22] and I believe a ties on gross is most
[46:25] scriptural because Jacob said of all
[46:28] that you give me I'll surely give a
[46:30] tenth unto deep so in my situation if I
[46:34] only paid taxes on my net income or my
[46:36] take-home pay I would be neglecting to
[46:38] honor God for the increase or money that
[46:42] was taken out for my retirement money
[46:44] take it out for my retirement and I have
[46:46] money take it out for our 403 - forum
[46:49] 401k for the Viacom so I think it'd be
[46:54] wrong for me there's 10 minutes let me
[46:56] do - I think it'd be wrong for me not to
[47:00] give God and not to hire God for all
[47:03] that money that's going to retirement if
[47:04] I understand that I feel like that be
[47:06] wrong how can I not honor God on them
[47:08] finding money that I made for retired or
[47:10] the money that I'm storing up in my 403b
[47:12] account how could I not honor God with
[47:15] that so that's my personal conviction
[47:17] you know I would encourage you to do
[47:19] limits on your growth
[47:22] I'm sorry gross income so since I pay
[47:25] tithe on the gross I do not make ties on
[47:28] my income tax return because I already
[47:30] paid ties on that income but if I pay
[47:33] guys only on the net which some people
[47:35] might do then you should be cheerful to
[47:37] make eyes on your income tax return as
[47:39] well because if I always say that God
[47:41] loves a cheerful Giver doesn't like a
[47:44] stubborn giver right either that's not
[47:46] pleased with that he loves a cheerful
[47:48] Giver I'm open to any questions on that
[47:50] if anybody has any questions the last
[47:53] questions I got that's pretty good time
[47:55] why is it okay to wear neck a necklace
[47:58] but not earrings very good question I
[48:00] thought this was a fantastic question
[48:01] I've got this question you know on
[48:03] YouTube and I've had to go back in
[48:05] Scripture I got emails on this question
[48:06] great question
[48:09] biblically necklaces or jewelry are fine
[48:12] as long as they're not very costly the
[48:14] Bible said we're only not to wear costly
[48:17] if you look that up in first Timothy
[48:18] women invented out to be ordained with
[48:21] the costly things right in a parable
[48:25] Jesus told how the prodigal is given a
[48:27] ream so Jesus went one us you know to
[48:31] avoid wearing rings if he gave a story
[48:32] in which a man was given a ring
[48:35] and there was a big scar he was the
[48:37] problem he was one for giving you one
[48:39] coming home so we know it's not a sin to
[48:41] wear jewelry some people major on a
[48:43] minor some people go all out and say oh
[48:45] you wear a wedding ring you know you're
[48:46] condemned yeah all these things to be
[48:49] wearing necklace you know your unholy
[48:50] you know but that's wrong there's no
[48:53] scripture for that they asked brother
[48:55] Brandon program should a Christian woman
[48:58] wear simple Jewry as necklaces or pearls
[49:00] well sister I know this means a lot to
[49:01] you I know it means a lot for me that's
[49:04] right for me for you to place your
[49:05] confidence I tell you the truth now
[49:07] remember the Bible said when you adore
[49:09] you're not adorned with costly jewels
[49:10] and pearls and all kinds of wearing the
[49:12] jewelry let that be the dawning of a
[49:14] peace and quiet and a meek spirit which
[49:16] I just sorted which is a great price
[49:18] lord I don't mean by that system that if
[49:21] you got a pin now this is me not the
[49:22] Lord if you got a pin that you underwear
[49:24] or a little necklace your husband get
[49:26] your maybe or something like that it's
[49:27] you are not to me I don't think that's
[49:29] best
[49:29] now that just mean I remember I make
[49:31] myself clear that's my opinion but I
[49:33] think it's the approach to it it's the
[49:35] way you do it see the motive behind it
[49:38] and when you see it's getting a hold of
[49:40] you then leave the thing alone so he
[49:43] says later how does get a hold of you
[49:44] through pride so wearing jewelry or
[49:48] necklaces becomes an issue of pride he
[49:50] said let it alone here's where he says
[49:52] it if women want to dress and make
[49:54] themselves a decent clean lady like Mike
[49:56] I think there's not a thing to that to
[49:58] me but when you get you're going to put
[50:01] that thing into making it a little pride
[50:02] then you're wrong it's your attitude
[50:04] about it so if somebody comes in here
[50:07] with you know a big old necklace on or
[50:09] man comes in with a big old Reynaud they
[50:10] thinking something well that's wrong
[50:12] that's prideful right it's not the
[50:15] outward adorning that God's interested
[50:16] in it's the in order to know Ramsey says
[50:21] excuse me for the next quote but he kind
[50:24] of makes a little joke but I just want
[50:25] to read it so you understand I think as
[50:27] far as a necklace now if you go loading
[50:29] yourself up like he went for the 10 step
[50:32] store down there with the magnet on
[50:33] that's kind of a little silly expression
[50:36] so yeah so much yo so much jewelry on
[50:40] everywhere you know he said I don't
[50:42] think that'd be right because he then
[50:44] says you wanna and then he says it's
[50:47] like a woman in a 10-cent store
[50:49] he said a woman that puts too much
[50:50] jewelry on is like she's trying to be
[50:53] young and be something that she's not
[50:55] and he said you can't go through life
[50:57] looking through a rear-view mirror
[50:58] trying to be young when you're when
[51:00] you're older
[51:01] okay now bands did see Christians don't
[51:04] do that
[51:04] a Christian don't try to be what he used
[51:07] to do and then he talks about not
[51:09] forgetting those things so he basically
[51:10] is with women how many women are meant
[51:12] while want to look like they're younger
[51:14] younger so they put on all the jewelry
[51:16] to feel younger so I don't think that
[51:18] only you know matters to our church you
[51:20] might say I don't see that myself
[51:23] but I think that answers the question
[51:25] part of it now here's the last part now
[51:27] concerning earrings and this if I taught
[51:29] Sunday school laughter I think John was
[51:30] ever I taught it in the sunday school
[51:33] biblically concerning earrings there are
[51:36] some earrings that godly women wore that
[51:38] seemed to not displease God so if you
[51:41] type in earrings in your concordance
[51:43] you're gonna find times where godly
[51:44] women actually more earrings and so one
[51:47] was Rebecca
[51:48] Elise or gave Rebecca earrings and rings
[51:51] and all kinds of things bracelets and
[51:53] all kinds of things that's why there's a
[51:54] balance to wearing jewelry and God's on
[51:57] Israel you know what I will drown in the
[51:59] blood member that I found in the blood
[52:00] and I pulled you out and I watched you
[52:03] he said I put earrings upon you so
[52:06] that's quite a scripture and that
[52:07] shocked me whenever I just always
[52:10] thought over against all earrings you
[52:12] know we're just all against that but see
[52:15] these earrings that they wore these
[52:17] earrings right that Rebecca and God
[52:19] would have spiritually placed on Israel
[52:21] could not have been ones that shed blood
[52:24] or put a mark on the human body like the
[52:28] all if you look up all its annexes 21 6
[52:31] and Deuteronomy 15 17 if a slave
[52:35] wouldn't go free and said well I don't
[52:37] want to be free I'll take my possessions
[52:39] back I just want to be a slave my whole
[52:40] life
[52:41] they take the person down to the altar
[52:44] and they put up all through his ear they
[52:47] bore a hole so that's a sign of but man
[52:51] that's a sign of not being able to hear
[52:53] the gospel anymore you can't vote
[52:54] freedom or your slave you're totally
[52:56] trapped you can never go free
[52:57] you understand that so God would that
[53:00] you know God was not a
[53:03] that or maybe bless that and then allow
[53:07] them allow you know hold the air to be a
[53:09] sign of someone you know who's a godly
[53:13] person it's a sign of someone who's
[53:14] rejected the truth of the gospel you
[53:16] know someone who is afraid to take their
[53:18] inheritance that's what it's a sign up
[53:20] and recall God prohibited markings on
[53:23] the flesh God
[53:24] remember that Leviticus 19:28 that's why
[53:26] we don't have tattoos so the earrings
[53:30] that Rebecca war or the earrings that
[53:32] you know God spiritually with a place on
[53:34] Israel would not have caused a mark and
[53:37] would not have shed blood because that's
[53:39] what slaves had that's kind of hearings
[53:41] slaves had a modern era earring would
[53:44] leave a mark even a hold the person's
[53:46] ear just like the description of the
[53:47] hall brother Graham told us that the
[53:49] modern day hearing symbolized
[53:51] worldliness and men a person would not
[53:53] hear the truth of the gospel preachers
[53:55] so there's a quote on that you so
[53:57] remember when the Jubilee come and the
[53:58] priest rode his trumpet sounding that
[54:00] every say to go free but if they refuse
[54:02] to accept their freedom and had to be
[54:04] taken to the temple to a post and at all
[54:06] borac him through the ear and then he
[54:09] served as master always it was put on
[54:11] his ears a type of hearing faith cometh
[54:14] by hearing he heard that trumpet but he
[54:17] didn't want to listen to it thanks a lot
[54:20] so then he if anybody have any questions
[54:22] you know feel free to get back to me by
[54:24] God's grace and so this is I say this
[54:26] you know if somebody comes in here and
[54:27] wears it to the pond hearing I can't do
[54:28] them that you know that's kind of the
[54:30] mail that would be my personal basket so
[54:32] we come in here become a new believer so
[54:34] I believe the best brother Jesse I wear
[54:36] clip-on earrings I'd say well premise of
[54:38] our what can I say against that Rebecca
[54:41] wore earrings I don't know if they hung
[54:43] on her ear I don't know if they win side
[54:45] were your know down I don't know what
[54:47] they look like but we can't condemn all
[54:49] earrings because Rebecca wore some in
[54:52] the Old Testament but they would not
[54:54] have been blood shedding earrings and
[54:55] would not have been earrings that left a
[54:57] mark everybody see the balance by God's
[54:59] grace by Madison where does every
[55:01] scripture where's that answer to every
[55:03] rm2 program said in the Bible so Bible
[55:07] you said is the end of all arguments I
[55:09] don't believe that the Bible is the end
[55:12] of all arguments so we're trying to
[55:14] rightly divide the word
[55:15] so I fifty twenty minutes on that
[55:17] forgive me I'm gonna try to shorten my
[55:19] sermon here by God's grace let's look at
[55:22] you're not Joshua so I'm gonna try to
[55:24] get back in the free team load if I can
[55:26] from teaching to preaching but a lot of
[55:29] questions and programs had a pastor
[55:30] loves to know it's on the hearts of the
[55:32] people he loves to know their questions
[55:35] alright so I like to look at this I
[55:40] found this little sunday-school picture
[55:41] here I have a bigger picture later but
[55:44] let's look at a fear not Joshua I
[55:46] remember we preached three sermons on
[55:49] fear so far as this is our horse sermon
[55:51] on beer but I'm just giving them
[55:52] individual titles you know so maybe I
[55:54] might help you remember a little more
[55:56] help me remember other than just part
[55:58] one part two or three the greatest
[56:02] hindrance to the American Christian by
[56:04] the man have said was fear I'll remember
[56:05] that from Wednesday you hopefully caught
[56:07] that if you weren't here will be caught
[56:08] it by listening to it during the sermon
[56:10] or after some time the rest of the week
[56:12] that's the greatest hindrance that
[56:14] brother branham said it's that doubt of
[56:16] thinking well should I try quoting the
[56:20] word or not should I take God at His
[56:22] Word or not my man I've traveled the
[56:23] world and when I see the biggest trouble
[56:26] with American Christians is fear they're
[56:29] scared that God won't keep his word not
[56:32] what I thought but member mannan also
[56:34] says Jesus always said fear not so when
[56:39] we go to God in prayer when we read the
[56:41] Bible when we're serving the Lord Jesus
[56:44] or were coming across a situation where
[56:46] we have to make a decision are we gonna
[56:48] pray are we gonna speak the word how are
[56:51] you approach the situation we must
[56:53] remember that Jesus will always say fear
[56:56] not and we must remember that we are in
[56:59] a very advanced intellectual society and
[57:03] this society will deny the power thereof
[57:07] they'll have a form of godliness but
[57:10] denying the power there I mean how many
[57:12] can see that by God's grace there's
[57:14] this nation has a form of godliness they
[57:16] go to church your circus religious acts
[57:19] when they deny the power where's the
[57:21] power leg power the power of the gospel
[57:27] lies in your faith praise God because
[57:30] Saint John says that your victory is
[57:34] your faith they met I literally and
[57:36] perfect case casts out all fear
[57:39] hallelujah so we know it's the greatest
[57:41] hindrance you and I must overcome fear
[57:44] praise God no I just want to show a few
[57:48] maps this is the first map I have
[57:49] another map now today I'm just going to
[57:52] preach a little bit on this Joshua a a
[57:55] story and I'll have to finish it maybe
[57:58] tonight or taking tonight of Oscar
[58:00] people that are here preach on the Book
[58:02] of Revelations live the notes on that
[58:04] ready to preach on that but Joshua come
[58:09] to the land and there were so many
[58:11] Canaanites now King Valley is a name
[58:13] that was used for individual people but
[58:15] it was also a general name given to
[58:18] anyone who'd lived in Palestine at that
[58:20] time so you have to kind of find that
[58:22] and balance that in the scripture but
[58:24] there was many different peoples many
[58:25] different acts we'd say in Palestine and
[58:29] this is just one map now today I'm going
[58:32] to preach on the seven nations that God
[58:35] said Joshua conquer okay and it's not
[58:38] eat of mites I'll tell you what visit is
[58:40] not and it's not the
[58:41] Philistines it's not to Moabites but all
[58:43] the other seven I believe are the ones
[58:46] I'm gonna preach on today by the grace
[58:48] of the Lord amen here's another picture
[58:51] you can see the hits I bikes the tights
[58:54] dirty strikes eight nights parasites
[58:56] nearby excu tonight - Jim cites border
[58:58] tykes
[58:59] em rights and other fifties they weren't
[59:02] listed they were not listed in the
[59:04] portion of Scripture I'm gonna read okay
[59:07] but no doubt they fought against the
[59:08] folks who turned out they're very
[59:09] formidable foe
[59:11] [Applause]
[59:15] amen so I'd like to now look at a few
[59:21] things here I want to just review a few
[59:23] thoughts here last year I mean I
[59:25] preached on if you remember I preached
[59:27] on the Asian parallels Joshua I'm not
[59:30] sure who remember that but I didn't
[59:32] preach at Lent
[59:33] by the grace of the Lord so the book of
[59:36] Joshua it parallels the book of
[59:39] Ephesians because Joshua we know was the
[59:44] first generation to take the promised
[59:47] land they're the first generation to
[59:49] cross over Jordan and possess all the
[59:52] promises and all the inheritance that
[59:55] God had for them I'm glad to be in the
[59:57] Joshua army today are you man said
[1:00:00] there's a Joshua outfit today are you
[1:00:02] part of that outfit amen
[1:00:03] I don't know I'm very thankful to be a
[1:00:06] part of that outfit today
[1:00:07] then Joshua outfit and Joshua place them
[1:00:10] physically in a physical end but the
[1:00:13] book of Ephesians places Christians
[1:00:16] spiritually in a spiritual condition
[1:00:18] such as you're seated in heavenly places
[1:00:21] in Christ Jesus Amen you have a
[1:00:23] spiritual seat you have a spiritual
[1:00:25] throne you have a spiritual Kingdom you
[1:00:28] rule as a king and priest am I to
[1:00:31] understand that you rule as a king you
[1:00:33] rule over your the sin of your members
[1:00:35] you rule or you're supposed to rule over
[1:00:36] spiritually over your situation that
[1:00:39] you're home and and all things like that
[1:00:41] you're supposed to rule over the evil
[1:00:42] spirits and so we see that to a pure
[1:00:45] type there and taking the land is the
[1:00:49] type both the individual going into the
[1:00:53] baptism of Holy Ghost and also the
[1:00:55] entire church so a type state Church
[1:00:59] going in the promised land and I thought
[1:01:00] it was interesting a few months ago
[1:01:02] today the Lord had me preach on Kadish
[1:01:04] party and separately member that when we
[1:01:05] preach that done the judgment seat is
[1:01:10] the house of God how she died as the
[1:01:11] judges remember that and run down to the
[1:01:13] mansion Radek a discard yes I thought I
[1:01:15] was
[1:01:18] but we know every Church must come to a
[1:01:21] Kadish Barnea are they gonna cross over
[1:01:23] into the baptism of the holy ghost and
[1:01:26] possess every puff promise and find
[1:01:28] their spiritual position in Christ I'm
[1:01:31] not going to ask anybody to raise their
[1:01:32] head but jerk we should have a button on
[1:01:34] our heart to know the position God has
[1:01:37] for us Amen man the adopted spiritual
[1:01:41] mature position God has for us we should
[1:01:43] have a burden though that in fact the
[1:01:44] Bible calls it a mystery in Ephesians 1
[1:01:47] it's the mystery of us will for your
[1:01:49] life everybody should be confessing and
[1:01:52] and praying for that Lord showed me the
[1:01:54] perfect will of my life that I could be
[1:01:59] at the center of your will amen
[1:02:03] Gloria and I want to remind you the
[1:02:07] program says the Holy Ghost is a type of
[1:02:09] the promised land and so I'm going to be
[1:02:12] emphasizing this over this type here is
[1:02:15] for those who have already gone through
[1:02:18] sanctification they've already gone
[1:02:20] through the statute would permit head
[1:02:22] once they've done that now they cross
[1:02:25] Jordan that crossing Jordan it's tight
[1:02:27] in tight as the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:30] Ghost or charity amen you've crossed in
[1:02:33] the Jordan and so now we're gonna bring
[1:02:35] out these seven nations and the I'm
[1:02:38] gonna call these golden nuggets amen
[1:02:40] I gots great so we're going back to
[1:02:42] scripture reminds us go to duckets and
[1:02:44] shine them up praise God and see the
[1:02:47] scriptural truth course amen hallelujah
[1:02:51] so I think where you're at is brother
[1:02:54] Graham tells us this he can say aren't
[1:02:56] you glad you serve the kind of God we
[1:02:59] serve you can know exactly where you are
[1:03:01] with him at any time and all the time
[1:03:05] how the who you even believe that if
[1:03:08] you're on the stache burger man and
[1:03:09] you're in sanctification still just a
[1:03:11] justification you can know exactly where
[1:03:13] you stand with God or if you're into the
[1:03:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost in the land
[1:03:17] you can know exactly where you stand you
[1:03:20] can know your position because God wants
[1:03:22] us to know we're called to do yes should
[1:03:25] I listen to as I was with Moses so I'll
[1:03:27] be with you
[1:03:28] 1860 I believe September 10 1960 and
[1:03:31] brother man tells us his position he
[1:03:34] said I got out of position he says I'm
[1:03:36] just paraphrasing I got out of position
[1:03:38] because I was majoring on the signpost
[1:03:41] remember that he said he would let
[1:03:44] people pull gifts and put his sermons
[1:03:46] out of him over until he almost lost his
[1:03:48] energy and I he said you think God would
[1:03:52] do that he said you think God would let
[1:03:53] a man brother man drive in a car away
[1:03:56] from a meeting almost crazy him and lost
[1:03:58] his mind and not even know where is that
[1:04:00] he said that was not God doing that to a
[1:04:02] man he said that was me being
[1:04:04] disobedient to my commission and the
[1:04:07] church said mother would let he love
[1:04:10] people so much he would let them go to
[1:04:13] sermons ah there's so much they had to
[1:04:14] pull him off the booklet you know that
[1:04:16] he's seen that that the Pappas showed
[1:04:18] her and he if he wasn't careful he keep
[1:04:21] let it going all the time all the time
[1:04:23] all the time and he wouldn't even know
[1:04:25] he said he said one time the brothers
[1:04:28] would have to walk him out in the street
[1:04:29] at three or four in the morning and he'd
[1:04:31] say oh I'm going home then I'm no got a
[1:04:32] meeting tomorrow brother Graham he said
[1:04:34] no I'm going home
[1:04:34] I got a kid oh my god you know my wife
[1:04:37] hurt doing these things he didn't even
[1:04:38] know her is that he said God would not
[1:04:41] do that to a person
[1:04:42] so I mean Oh God won't wear you out
[1:04:45] I mean understand that remember that
[1:04:48] preacher his name was it Nelson the man
[1:04:50] who said I'm kind of a word of Lord for
[1:04:51] pastor Nelson he's gonna have a heart
[1:04:53] attack if you don't slow down God
[1:04:56] doesn't want us to overwork ourselves
[1:04:58] now we say that all the time I'd rather
[1:05:01] wear out or wear out and rust out right
[1:05:04] but at the same time of Jesus when he
[1:05:06] was tired what'd he do he went up into
[1:05:08] the mountain to rest and pray amen so
[1:05:13] there's a balance to that there's a very
[1:05:15] good balance I probably have said I got
[1:05:17] out of my position if you read listen
[1:05:19] that's real close all the way through
[1:05:20] even in the prayer line he starts
[1:05:22] talking about he keeps going back and
[1:05:23] forth back to his Commission and he said
[1:05:25] I got my eyes off the Commission and I
[1:05:28] was just staring at the signpost
[1:05:29] the discernment discernment the sermon
[1:05:31] and he sent from henceforth I'll go out
[1:05:33] and I won't let everybody just pull
[1:05:35] these out he said I just got to get my
[1:05:38] eyes back on the Commission
[1:05:40] the Commission was pray for this stick
[1:05:42] amen be sincere get the people to
[1:05:45] believe you and not even cancer most
[1:05:46] ever before your prayer amen
[1:05:48] he said I find you know getting that
[1:05:50] back of my position and never there was
[1:05:53] prophecy on that his brother Graham said
[1:05:55] there's a prophecy the tabernacle week
[1:05:56] before it said within eight days you'll
[1:05:58] be standing like Moses and Joshua in
[1:06:00] this tabernacle and what did he say he
[1:06:04] said and he says now I'm like Joshua he
[1:06:06] said I'm not gonna I'm not going to look
[1:06:08] back at the second pole anymore
[1:06:09] wandering the wilderness I'm going into
[1:06:11] the third pole sorry I know I said a lot
[1:06:16] right there but maybe I need to reach a
[1:06:18] whole sermon on that but what I'm saying
[1:06:20] I've got the going he said like Joshua I
[1:06:22] got to go to the third Pole I spent too
[1:06:24] much time at the signpost discernment
[1:06:27] let people you misused my gift I misuse
[1:06:30] my gift I've got to go into the third
[1:06:32] pole and look George he's 50 years old
[1:06:34] and he's still finding his right
[1:06:36] position in God and he says and you can
[1:06:39] let this up
[1:06:39] he said I'm finally at the center of
[1:06:42] God's will
[1:06:43] how many appreciates the humility of
[1:06:45] God's prophets he was so humble at 50
[1:06:48] years old to say listen I've been out of
[1:06:50] God's will slightly for a little while
[1:06:52] because I've been letting people pull
[1:06:54] too much on my discernment yet now if a
[1:06:56] prophet search them like we say if a
[1:07:00] prophet slightly God position and for
[1:07:02] years and years was worn down and hurt
[1:07:04] and hurt himself by his own decisions
[1:07:07] and eat us right now from the Holy
[1:07:09] Spirit how about the rest of us from our
[1:07:10] prophets amen see why this is important
[1:07:15] it's very important for years and years
[1:07:17] and years it was out of position and
[1:07:20] hurting himself and not in the perfect
[1:07:24] position but God straightens him out if
[1:07:27] you listen to that as I wasn't with
[1:07:28] Moses Church you and I can know exactly
[1:07:31] where we stand with God at any time Lord
[1:07:35] abide the promised land am I still
[1:07:37] fighting off nations until I get in the
[1:07:39] promised land
[1:07:40] or I'm sorry am I in the pride of my day
[1:07:43] The Bachelor dose but not quite in my
[1:07:44] position yet because I'm still battling
[1:07:46] or have I like halo have I reached my
[1:07:49] mom and I'm living off the mountain and
[1:07:51] I'm victorious
[1:07:52] we can know exactly where we stand with
[1:07:56] God some of us might have to go back in
[1:07:58] the same vacation which is fine
[1:07:59] well I don't have really emerged I don't
[1:08:01] the virtue strength to really live the
[1:08:03] life in front of my co-workers and my
[1:08:05] family compromise on this favor to
[1:08:09] knowledge they understand you know cut
[1:08:12] their hair I understand these things
[1:08:14] you know we God is so merciful he wants
[1:08:17] us to know exactly where we sit and
[1:08:20] Church you and I and know where we stand
[1:08:22] with God at any time the Prophet said I
[1:08:24] believe that because the Bible said he
[1:08:26] made known to us the mystery of his will
[1:08:31] so brothers ask me I think we're at
[1:08:33] ministers meeting or I'm not sure when
[1:08:36] some brothers asked me a few years ago
[1:08:38] they said where are you at the staff
[1:08:40] room and I said well I believe I'm in
[1:08:41] charity and I obviously be not being
[1:08:43] adopted and I was saying that humbly I
[1:08:47] honestly felt that because when you're
[1:08:50] adopted your word is just as good as his
[1:08:52] word
[1:08:52] you're an adopted son and you only say
[1:08:56] what the father would say and the
[1:08:59] example I gave as a pastor and at that
[1:09:01] time I was seeing a lot of great
[1:09:02] feedback from the preaching you know
[1:09:05] your your accurate you know and I still
[1:09:07] do many times I'm thankful for that I
[1:09:09] still do but I told the brothers I said
[1:09:12] you know what I preach when I come out
[1:09:14] of that office I preach I see God
[1:09:16] talking to the people and people come up
[1:09:18] for prayer and things that I don't know
[1:09:20] and that proves to me that I'm speaking
[1:09:22] God's Word and not mine I'm not leading
[1:09:25] people to sit now I might back up now
[1:09:27] and say well maybe I'm just fighting off
[1:09:28] maybe I'm not correctly positioned
[1:09:30] placed or maybe I would close to my land
[1:09:32] but I'm still maybe I'm in my lamp but
[1:09:34] not fully there yet even I might say
[1:09:37] that you know as I think more about it
[1:09:39] but the point is we need to know our
[1:09:42] office like remember the women have the
[1:09:43] nine gifts and also a woman is a fifth
[1:09:46] gospel they have that position to do
[1:09:48] there's all kinds of positions the thing
[1:09:51] is we can understand where God's called
[1:09:54] us and we can be at the very center of
[1:09:56] as well forget the very center very sad
[1:10:00] not slightly off to the left slightly
[1:10:02] off to the right but that the very
[1:10:04] Center of his will doing exactly what
[1:10:07] your call to dude and you are seated in
[1:10:11] heavenly places you're ruling over sin
[1:10:14] the devil lusts in the world how many
[1:10:16] one live there I would live there like I
[1:10:20] told those brothers I personally feel
[1:10:21] there and I've got to keep driving out
[1:10:25] the rest of it I know Satan might come
[1:10:28] and fight me but you know what I gotta
[1:10:29] have a possession I gotta fight somebody
[1:10:30] you know I got we always have to fight
[1:10:32] somebody have some battles and if I
[1:10:36] didn't see the work of God in my life I
[1:10:37] wouldn't believe that when I see the
[1:10:40] work of God now right now that's a whole
[1:10:43] lot there and none of that was in my
[1:10:44] note so forgive me brother Hansen
[1:10:46] justification segregation that facility
[1:10:49] goes justification was leaving Egypt
[1:10:51] sanctification was the desert and The
[1:10:53] Bachelor ghost was crossing Jordan Amen
[1:10:56] now I'm just got the skip on a lot here
[1:11:00] because this is a review I want to get
[1:11:01] to the golden nuggets and I believe
[1:11:03] they're going nuggets I hope they're a
[1:11:05] blessing to you now one of the reason
[1:11:07] program preach this the adoption message
[1:11:09] about Ephesians parallel Nostrum he said
[1:11:11] now this is my purpose of preaching this
[1:11:13] the church is always trying to take
[1:11:15] somebody else's corner but don't you do
[1:11:19] that you can never raise horn in
[1:11:20] Ephraim's corner if you're monastic you
[1:11:22] got to take your place in Christ
[1:11:23] positionally place it he talks about out
[1:11:26] if somebody's a preacher somebody wants
[1:11:27] to be like a preacher or somebody is a
[1:11:29] singer someone will be like a singer
[1:11:30] they want to be like somebody else
[1:11:32] rather than being what God called you to
[1:11:34] be about that said I know your position
[1:11:36] in Christ you can do what you say you
[1:11:38] have whatever gift you have you can do
[1:11:41] it that's how you know
[1:11:44] Amen that's how you know so the purpose
[1:11:48] behind him preaching about you know
[1:11:49] taking the Holy Ghost or taking the
[1:11:51] promised land was so everybody can find
[1:11:54] their position and happily serve God
[1:11:56] Amen that's what we want Church we want
[1:11:59] everybody Rider Christ fellowship to
[1:12:00] happily serve God in and hanging on
[1:12:03] every word get God's instruction service
[1:12:06] after service and overcome Satan little
[1:12:08] by little and get all the victories God
[1:12:10] has undermined a minute you shouldn't be
[1:12:14] defeated we should be more than
[1:12:15] conquerors in Christ
[1:12:17] hallelujah to know our position
[1:12:21] that's why everybody has to have a
[1:12:22] pastor God doesn't want us wandering
[1:12:24] around to services all the time I've
[1:12:27] watched people wander from church to
[1:12:30] church to church and even to this church
[1:12:33] and they're so unstable and their home
[1:12:35] is always on a border arguments between
[1:12:38] husband and wife and children rebellious
[1:12:40] and no suggestions the Word of God and
[1:12:42] then certain sins like gossip or pride
[1:12:46] or
[1:12:46] lust or certain things they're just
[1:12:48] rampant because they're not in their
[1:12:51] position and God told Joshua everybody
[1:12:54] needs their position everybody needs
[1:12:56] their place amen
[1:12:58] I know one brother particular tried to
[1:13:00] preach for a while that group tried to
[1:13:02] sit the leak Psalms that fell through
[1:13:03] and then of course he doesn't go to this
[1:13:05] church and tried to all these things all
[1:13:07] these things that never confide his
[1:13:08] position because he's understanding was
[1:13:10] just floating from here to there the
[1:13:11] Bible calls that a wandering star we're
[1:13:15] not to be wandering star boat ramps and
[1:13:16] we need to find our position in God's
[1:13:18] economy and God's astronomy and stay
[1:13:21] there and shine the light of Christ amen
[1:13:23] Oh hallelujah now I got a whole lot and
[1:13:30] I'm not to be able to get into a whole
[1:13:32] lot so let me just keep going quickly
[1:13:36] then we'll get to these seven nations
[1:13:38] Joshua program said times two things
[1:13:41] Joshua types the Holy Ghost but man said
[1:13:43] that's an adoption part one
[1:13:45] he said Joshua Jesus our Savior Josh
[1:13:48] represents the Holy Spirit representing
[1:13:52] it in the spiritual as it was the
[1:13:53] natural he's our great warrior today
[1:13:55] he's our leader how do the Holy Spirit's
[1:13:57] our leader today
[1:13:58] he's our Joshua but then remember and
[1:14:01] pick up your pen and write the Holy
[1:14:04] Spirit play said pick up your pen writes
[1:14:06] and that the endtime leader to the seven
[1:14:09] churches would be the Joshua represented
[1:14:12] Joshua that took the people in and all
[1:14:15] those that followed Joshua were type of
[1:14:17] Caleb a man or the anti-type of Caleb on
[1:14:21] this video so the Holy Spirit says pick
[1:14:23] up your pen write the entire
[1:14:25] messengers Joshua all those that follow
[1:14:28] Josh for brother grant are caleb amen I
[1:14:32] like that so you and I remember we could
[1:14:35] have got this power he said is it my
[1:14:37] turn yet is it my turn
[1:14:39] I'm ready where's my Mountain Moses
[1:14:41] promised me a mountain give me my
[1:14:43] brother Joshua said then you go fight
[1:14:45] for it he was ready for a fight he was
[1:14:48] ready to take on the devil he wasn't
[1:14:49] scared of temptation he wasn't scared of
[1:14:51] sin he was ready to fight he was ready
[1:14:53] to be a victory man that's what we need
[1:14:56] in our church so every church needs
[1:14:58] people that are ready to fight people
[1:15:00] that are ready to quote the Word of God
[1:15:01] and live on the Word of God amen
[1:15:05] remember he had a different spirit Caleb
[1:15:08] had a different spirit and all the other
[1:15:09] ones Nathan yeah the Holy Spirit praise
[1:15:12] God
[1:15:12] he was a Gentile right he was Oh get
[1:15:15] strong praise God no matter how long
[1:15:17] this Lord tarries no matter how old we
[1:15:20] get we can be strong and thanks amen
[1:15:22] exactly right now I don't have time to
[1:15:26] go through this I'm having to hit the
[1:15:27] highlights why did God drive out the
[1:15:30] Canaanites there's many reasons but one
[1:15:35] of the reasons it is that this cup of
[1:15:37] their iniquity had come to being full
[1:15:39] that's in Genesis 15 verse 16 God told
[1:15:43] Abraham your people are going to go to
[1:15:44] Egypt I'm gonna call them out but I'm
[1:15:47] not going to call them out yet outside
[1:15:49] for 400 years and then when the cup of
[1:15:52] iniquity am righteous fall then I'm
[1:15:54] gonna drive them out God was so gracious
[1:15:57] and I believe that was over 800 years
[1:16:00] when I was eight hundred nine hundred
[1:16:01] years you're Abraham all the way to
[1:16:03] Joshua I feel look grow quick anybody
[1:16:05] want me to look

[1:16:17] Wednesday night for the camera sure that
[1:16:19] massages your cams revelation with me
[1:16:21] Jesus told the church age about your
[1:16:24] church age I'm giving you space to
[1:16:25] repent
[1:16:26] jessabelle and he repented not it was
[1:16:29] almost 900 years of mercy God extended
[1:16:33] mercy to the Jezebel system here's 900
[1:16:35] years our God is so tremendous
[1:16:38] no that's Americana the tremendous his
[1:16:40] strength never faileth this mercy
[1:16:42] endureth forever he is Jezebel and the
[1:16:45] potpourri of these wicked folks he gives
[1:16:48] him 900 years to repair their Crusades
[1:16:51] and the Inquisition he's still offering
[1:16:53] the hand of her penance our God is so
[1:16:55] wonderful amen I don't know how to say
[1:16:57] no words to express any men but he's so
[1:17:00] wonderful and so God gave the em rights
[1:17:03] this say bop bop same amount of time
[1:17:07] that was one reason I program said don't
[1:17:11] you worry the goddess evil age God is
[1:17:12] waiting to the iniquity of these modern
[1:17:14] amirite s-- is fulfilled don't worry

[1:17:21] Exodus a man which is Christ a then
[1:17:25] Moses times Christ that's from the God
[1:17:27] is evil ladies so what are we waiting
[1:17:29] for
[1:17:30] oh is it the church's fault well I don't
[1:17:32] know I can't put any condemnation of the
[1:17:33] church because there's no kind of nation
[1:17:36] under great Jesus it's not the church's
[1:17:38] fall it's God king merciful it's God
[1:17:41] giving salvation still account that the
[1:17:44] long-suffering Lord is salvation glory I
[1:17:51] feel like a preacher this morning amen
[1:17:53] that's exactly right
[1:17:54] he's waiting on these modern memorized
[1:17:57] to get their cup of iniquity filled up
[1:18:00] and then he's just in destroying this
[1:18:02] birth and burning it over he's not just
[1:18:05] yet there has to be more have to reject
[1:18:07] him or reject him more but while they're
[1:18:09] rejecting the more brother Hammond I'm
[1:18:11] accepted in Laura Nariman my life is
[1:18:14] being more centered around the Word of
[1:18:15] God I believe me more of the word I'm
[1:18:17] possessed see Martha promised land and
[1:18:19] if I would Joshua I can a man hide
[1:18:22] Amelia exactly right look in the
[1:18:29] scripture I want you to notice this I
[1:18:32] don't have time but I have to preach a
[1:18:35] whole other message I guess
[1:18:36] hate you now like I study so hard and I
[1:18:40] study for so many hours and my notes are
[1:18:42] like this long on a computer
[1:18:43] I just want to preach it all in one show
[1:18:47] not doing that because I feel like I'm
[1:18:50] leaving something out but you need you
[1:18:52] know I love you I want you to be strong
[1:18:55] to overcome exodus 20:3 that you said my
[1:19:00] angel go before me 23:23 and bring thee
[1:19:04] into the land of the hammerites the
[1:19:05] hittite as parasites Canaanites Hittites
[1:19:07] Jebusites and I will cut them off
[1:19:09] thou shall not bow down to their gods
[1:19:12] nor serve them nor do after their works
[1:19:15] so what is God gardens enough because of
[1:19:17] their idolatry their evil works now look
[1:19:22] at verse 29 X is 23 29 I will not drive
[1:19:25] them out before thee in 1 year
[1:19:27] I just want to remind us of then when
[1:19:31] you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:33] and you're really in the Holy Ghost your
[1:19:35] problems are not gonna vanish you one
[1:19:37] year because that's the tight God wants
[1:19:41] you and I to learn how to fight off
[1:19:43] pesky demons pesky habits that will go
[1:19:46] away and the church said Amen I want you
[1:19:49] and I to learn how to drive them out
[1:19:51] little by little is the first 30 cents
[1:19:55] by little and little I will drive them
[1:19:58] out from before thee until thou be
[1:20:00] increased and inherit the land thou
[1:20:02] shall make no covenant with them nor
[1:20:04] with their gods
[1:20:06] now shall not dwell in my land unless
[1:20:08] that makes it
[1:20:09] they make these sit against me now in
[1:20:17] Deuteronomy 18 verse 19 God tells us why
[1:20:20] he's going to drive them out again he
[1:20:21] said because of their abominations now
[1:20:24] should I not learn to do after the
[1:20:25] abominations of those nations throughout
[1:20:27] 1810 there shall not be found among you
[1:20:29] anyone that making this son or daughter
[1:20:31] to pass through the fire or the use of
[1:20:34] divination or an observer of times or an
[1:20:36] enchanter or witch or a charmer Orcas
[1:20:39] consulted with premier spirits or a
[1:20:41] wizard or necromancer for all these two
[1:20:45] things are an abomination of the Lord
[1:20:47] and because of those abominations
[1:20:50] the LORD thy God won't drive an opera
[1:20:52] before CA then why does God try these
[1:20:55] nations out because they're living in
[1:20:57] sin
[1:20:58] they're killing their own babies they're
[1:21:01] worshipping idols they're having sexual
[1:21:03] immorality and gods that I'm going to
[1:21:06] try them out because of their disregard
[1:21:09] for my word I've given them 900 years
[1:21:11] repent and they failed to repent and now
[1:21:14] their cups full and I'm driving them out
[1:21:16] before you so this wasn't legal Assad
[1:21:20] wasn't mean legalistic with these people
[1:21:22] I could talked about right God mrs.
[1:21:25] Gossett when we preach our standards
[1:21:27] God's even asking us to be Legolas he's
[1:21:29] telling us to do things because it'll
[1:21:31] protect us and help us to love him and
[1:21:34] honor him praise God
[1:21:37] you watch your life church just let go
[1:21:40] in one area like just let go with
[1:21:42] cigarettes start smoking again or
[1:21:45] whatever drinking again you watch what
[1:21:46] happens to your life just let one thing
[1:21:50] just start lying a little bit and keep
[1:21:53] lying to watch your life watch how low
[1:21:55] you fall are with me Church watch
[1:21:59] although God doesn't give us these
[1:22:02] standard are you just excited you just
[1:22:03] get your daughter's ear pierced with
[1:22:05] blood and you just watch your family's
[1:22:07] life watch it you sister just cuts your
[1:22:11] hair a little bit I can show you
[1:22:12] churches that they let that happen for
[1:22:14] 30 years and tell you the awful
[1:22:16] testimonies that come out of that right
[1:22:20] you just compromise a little you swear a
[1:22:23] little bit of makeup and watch that
[1:22:24] little turn into a big pretty soon it'll
[1:22:29] just flooding and you won't have any
[1:22:30] control because you give the devil an
[1:22:32] inch he'll take a mile if I will said
[1:22:35] neither give place to the devil it's the
[1:22:37] little foxes that swung by
[1:22:39] why can't I get my turn everybody can I
[1:22:41] show the fruit little foxes are spoiling
[1:22:43] your virus and when the Word of God
[1:22:47] boy he's trying to protect us
[1:22:51] he's not trying to harm us with these
[1:22:53] things about you know make up in here
[1:22:55] incident and in shorts and pants oh he's
[1:22:58] not trying to harm us he's trying to
[1:22:59] protect us we won't go in the promised
[1:23:04] land with those types of things look at
[1:23:08] Deuteronomy 20 verse 18 he probably
[1:23:10] twenty eighteen but man warns them about
[1:23:12] these seven nations that they teach you
[1:23:14] not to do with all their abominations
[1:23:16] which they have done in their gods
[1:23:18] so should ye sit against the Lord so
[1:23:21] whenever you let a little Synod it's
[1:23:23] going to teach you to compromise again I
[1:23:26] talked to numerous drug addicts lately
[1:23:29] as soon as they let one in of cocaine or
[1:23:34] crack or meth as soon as they let wanted
[1:23:37] it opens the floodgates for all the
[1:23:38] others one and then they learn to open
[1:23:44] themselves up there's so much more and I
[1:23:47] don't very you know sweet people that
[1:23:49] are addicted to drugs and don't think
[1:23:51] they can overcome when you're fasting
[1:23:52] hard this week
[1:23:53] people are not mistaken that don't get
[1:23:55] victory over these addictions they're so
[1:23:57] powerful and Jesus said if you get one
[1:24:02] demon off you but don't get it filled
[1:24:03] with the Holy Ghost seven more will come
[1:24:05] back now you gotta Center now you've got
[1:24:08] complete oppression I say like that
[1:24:10] because seven is a number of completion
[1:24:13] just one being on a person is awful
[1:24:15] well if they don't get victory over that
[1:24:17] and then let that come back in don't be
[1:24:19] completely possessed in some way in
[1:24:21] their lives with me we can't compromise
[1:24:25] on one thing and we don't want you we
[1:24:27] want to be thankful for the land that we
[1:24:29] have we were to keep God's Word and we
[1:24:31] want to be faithful with God's harness
[1:24:33] with you we want to hear it all God's
[1:24:34] promises but we got to try them out
[1:24:38] we've got something to do McGriff said
[1:24:41] god I could have took a broom and he
[1:24:43] after that up Egypt he could have took
[1:24:44] that groom and he said he could have
[1:24:46] swept out all the inhabitants and said
[1:24:48] here you go here's all your food here's
[1:24:51] all your houses he could have took out
[1:24:52] the broom and swept at all but my dad
[1:24:54] said God doesn't want to do that because
[1:24:56] he wants you and I to learn how to fight
[1:24:58] the goodbye
[1:24:59] Hey he wants us to learn how to be like
[1:25:03] him praise the Lord he was supposed to
[1:25:06] be adopted children to know it what the
[1:25:08] Father's Word said and know how the
[1:25:10] father would have it he wants us to be
[1:25:12] real sugar that act just like the father
[1:25:14] glory to you thank you Jesus
[1:25:19] Exodus 34 10 through 17 says the same
[1:25:23] thing he was he talks about how break
[1:25:26] down their altars at verse 13 break down
[1:25:28] their images cut down their groves do
[1:25:32] not let the nuts and now and do not take
[1:25:35] of their daughters under thy sons and
[1:25:37] daughters go whoring after their gods
[1:25:39] don't leader marry with them penis
[1:25:42] because you'll learn to live like them
[1:25:45] praise God how many thank over the power
[1:25:48] of the Holy Spirit
[1:25:51] now God I'm gonna finally gonna try to
[1:25:54] close the Nexus let me set a time of 15
[1:25:55] minutes
[1:25:56] it's really something mercy I got so
[1:26:01] much yeah I just you know I just want to
[1:26:02] preach it all to you you've been blessed
[1:26:04] so far but in Georgia where God told
[1:26:08] Joshua three times did not fear these
[1:26:11] seven nations now I'm not going to go
[1:26:15] through those all but I want to read a
[1:26:18] few scriptures let's all go to turn
[1:26:22] around 7 1 let's all go there dude
[1:26:24] around you step 1 you got your Bibles
[1:26:25] and then we'll get to these types and
[1:26:27] I'll finish there that's gold by God's
[1:26:28] grace I love the word church the more I
[1:26:31] get to the Word of God the more I love
[1:26:33] the more you and I get into it the more
[1:26:36] will open up the more you eat the Word
[1:26:40] of God the more will come from from milk
[1:26:42] into meat it depends how much you eat on
[1:26:45] it right because if you're just a
[1:26:47] beginner I just got a little time to
[1:26:48] work it just like milk to you but if you
[1:26:51] have more more of it receive it becomes
[1:26:52] meteor meteor now that you can handle
[1:26:56] more yes
[1:26:59] Deuteronomy 7 1 when the LORD thy God
[1:27:03] shall bring thee into the land whither
[1:27:05] thou goest to possess it and has cast
[1:27:07] out many nations before thee now listen
[1:27:08] you're 7 the Hittites the girgashites
[1:27:11] and the Amorite
[1:27:13] the canaanites at the Perizzites the
[1:27:14] Hivites and the Jebusites and notice God
[1:27:16] said seven nations greater and mightier
[1:27:20] than now so these were not pushover
[1:27:25] nations these are not third world
[1:27:28] country armies
[1:27:30] these are greater aren't worth and
[1:27:33] medication we're like the spirits we're
[1:27:35] like we're like the third world country
[1:27:36] right Israel's like the throne country
[1:27:38] we're going to get seven nations greater
[1:27:40] and mightier than you now this is after
[1:27:43] you get the Holy Ghost the church dead
[1:27:46] this is the type you go into the
[1:27:49] promised land and now if you've got to
[1:27:50] drive up seven nations and it will all
[1:27:53] happen at once but year by year you've
[1:27:56] got to serve God faithfully keep the
[1:27:59] word meditate it in your mind speak the
[1:28:01] words write out the inhabitants and if
[1:28:04] you do you'll try about seven nations or
[1:28:06] demons greater and mightier than you are
[1:28:09] amen because Satan we are nomads
[1:28:12] forsaken but we got one inside of us
[1:28:14] who's greater than safety razors he
[1:28:16] lives in us the Holy Ghost in our flesh
[1:28:18] that's in the world event I'm Olivia
[1:28:21] we're known as for Saint we're known as
[1:28:24] for these set of demons but with the
[1:28:25] Holy Ghost we've got the word and
[1:28:27] powering that exactly right now let me
[1:28:31] just get to this here
[1:28:34] Joshua 3:10 I'm gonna read out of my
[1:28:36] Bible if you got it you can read it too
[1:28:38] I'm just going to get this because I
[1:28:40] this is a thought I had I just water
[1:28:42] free so hope you like me just by God's
[1:28:43] grace I haven't typed me I'm gonna do
[1:28:47] how to tighten in the next few minutes
[1:28:48] as we close I got 12 minutes mature I
[1:28:51] think I'll be done in a minute
[1:28:54] Joshua 3:10 and Joshua said hereby he
[1:28:58] shall know that the Living God is among
[1:28:59] you and that he will without fail dried
[1:29:02] out from before he the Canaanites and
[1:29:04] the Hittites and the Hittites and the
[1:29:05] parasites and the girgashites and the
[1:29:07] amorite and the gender sex now this is
[1:29:09] right after they cross Jordan and God
[1:29:12] tell Jeremiah or sir Joshua tells the
[1:29:15] army Joshua tells the army God's gonna
[1:29:19] drive them up God had already sent this
[1:29:21] in Exodus and Deuteronomy he already
[1:29:23] listed these seven nations he's insane
[1:29:25] years now and finally they get the spot
[1:29:27] for the atom where now it's time to
[1:29:28] fight these demons now most is talking
[1:29:31] about it for years the proper governor
[1:29:33] talked about it for years but now you
[1:29:35] and I are gonna drive them out amen
[1:29:38] in other words just know it's not time
[1:29:40] to talk about anymore it's time to do it
[1:29:42] it's not time to just have same to have
[1:29:45] faith now it's time for you to show me
[1:29:47] your faith by your works out of India we
[1:29:51] don't want to talk about maybe something
[1:29:53] that maybe something now is the day to
[1:29:54] fight and so you can fight the first one
[1:29:57] that God leads you to fight now I don't
[1:29:59] have the order yet we've spent studying
[1:30:01] on the seven names of these seven
[1:30:03] nations so let's look at this now
[1:30:04] remember recall it at seven means
[1:30:06] completion so God is going to give them
[1:30:09] a complete victory in the days of Joshua
[1:30:11] now you'll find out later of course that
[1:30:14] not all that were driven out Hey
[1:30:16] but all those that God wanted to be
[1:30:19] driven out were driven out and Josh was
[1:30:21] listed as a faithful minister at the end
[1:30:23] of all this use a faithful prophet so he
[1:30:26] drove out killed or subdued all that God
[1:30:29] called him to do could he have gone more
[1:30:32] yes he could have but God was saving
[1:30:34] that time after David and Solomon sin
[1:30:35] and then also typeset no matter how
[1:30:38] victorious we are no matter how many
[1:30:40] decades I served in the message and
[1:30:42] serve Jesus Christ and all they say no
[1:30:43] matter how to live it goes I'll still
[1:30:45] have somebody to fight how do they get
[1:30:48] in other words that sin nature is always
[1:30:49] going to be inside of us and we'll
[1:30:51] always have to keep sin nature under
[1:30:53] control by the Holy Spirit and the
[1:30:55] church said so see it means completion
[1:30:58] there's seven days duration seven seals
[1:31:00] seven angels that maturity seven
[1:31:01] trumpets planes my house seven means
[1:31:03] completion so God in tight
[1:31:06] ladies it when the first believer goes
[1:31:09] in the promised land you've got you got
[1:31:10] to get a complete victory can I say like
[1:31:12] that you got to get complete victory how
[1:31:15] many want complete victory by the grace
[1:31:16] of God you're going to fight but we can
[1:31:19] do it okay here's the seven nations
[1:31:21] again I'm going into order that Joshua
[1:31:23] listed them in verse 10 I'm chapter 3
[1:31:27] I'm going in this morning I'm sorry
[1:31:28] Katie likes Hittites invites parasites
[1:31:31] dirty shags a mind
[1:31:34] now each one I can preach a sermon on or
[1:31:39] a series on and you'll see one of them
[1:31:44] one of them are right now on preaching
[1:31:45] one series right now on one of these
[1:31:46] it's the king I'm sorry sorry fifth guru
[1:31:53] Sikes Emirati Chosun let's start with
[1:31:55] Canaanites
[1:31:55] now I'm taking their names or their
[1:31:58] occupations and I'm typing them
[1:32:00] spiritually my grandma calls that a
[1:32:02] golden nugget when you take somebody
[1:32:03] from the Old Testament shine it up and
[1:32:05] look at the types and applying with
[1:32:07] Christ today he said that's a golden
[1:32:08] number and he loved to shine those up
[1:32:12] lowered the word Canaanite means a
[1:32:16] trader or merchant they live by the sea
[1:32:21] by the coast of Jordan Canaanites were
[1:32:23] the sons of ham and he was the curse son
[1:32:26] of Noah the word Canaanite sometimes
[1:32:30] refers to any non-israeli person in
[1:32:32] Palestine they dwell in the richest most
[1:32:36] important parts of Palestine their
[1:32:38] cities were the centres of great
[1:32:40] commercial activities so Canaanites
[1:32:43] light riches worldly possessions the
[1:32:47] love of money these were the richest of
[1:32:49] all the inhabitants and they must be
[1:32:53] driven out how many would say as it ends
[1:32:56] as a witness of this sermon that even
[1:33:00] though you think you got that you
[1:33:01] believe you got the Holy Ghost you still
[1:33:02] have to drive out the love for money
[1:33:04] anybody say that well then you're pretty
[1:33:07] then you're pretty special that
[1:33:09] virtually the Canaanites were the
[1:33:12] richest device of the riches they were
[1:33:14] the richest they're the traitors the
[1:33:15] merchants they handled the future
[1:33:17] possessions and gotta go Joshua
[1:33:19] drive those Canaanites out you're gonna
[1:33:23] have to fight and you're gonna fight
[1:33:24] little by little your love for money or
[1:33:27] your worries about money your tears
[1:33:28] about money
[1:33:29] they might not go away in one here but
[1:33:31] he's driving they're not and pretty soon
[1:33:32] you'll get that victory over the hay
[1:33:35] you won't be able to pay your tithes and
[1:33:37] offerings the right way you'll be able
[1:33:38] to do all this where to give to the poor
[1:33:40] you have all these things
[1:33:41] really a child Joshua if you're really
[1:33:43] okay up you'll try about those
[1:33:45] Canaanites amen good now we know time to
[1:33:50] read this like I said I can do a whole
[1:33:51] sermon on this the riches love of money
[1:33:55] but I just hit the highlights love out
[1:33:57] the world in things in the world we
[1:33:58] could go through that right all deals
[1:34:02] with pride of life so canonize represent
[1:34:06] traders merchants worldly possessions
[1:34:08] riches worldly things how many other
[1:34:10] Lord this is 5 so set up our lens that
[1:34:13] would have reached on Wednesday because
[1:34:16] that would everybody to hear it because
[1:34:19] it gave me new insight into my walk with
[1:34:20] the Lord wonder sister Wendy why I gotta
[1:34:23] struggle with money er well I got it
[1:34:25] look at these next ones why I got struck
[1:34:26] with fear and the Bible later right
[1:34:28] their fear was lame the promised land
[1:34:30] they had to drive it out hey not before
[1:34:34] the promise that in the promised land
[1:34:37] not in sanctification but in the baptism
[1:34:40] of the Holy Ghost Hittites and I can
[1:34:46] share this with you just by a quickie
[1:34:47] now if you wanted afterwards Hebrew this
[1:34:50] actually means descendants of half-half
[1:34:53] was a son of cainan remember the curse
[1:34:55] on ham right I'm sorry the curse of ham
[1:34:59] ham was the curse will now look at this
[1:35:01] church isn't this powerful this is why
[1:35:03] I'm so excited half means terror or fear
[1:35:06] in Hebrew they had to drive out the
[1:35:09] terror or the Hittites in their promised
[1:35:13] land and I've been preaching on the
[1:35:15] spirit of fear and God has not given us
[1:35:19] the spirit of fear for the power
[1:35:23] sounds like jumping in my heart like hi
[1:35:26] this is powerful these are golden
[1:35:27] nuggets we could preach a whole series
[1:35:30] on the Canaanites a whole series we are
[1:35:32] preaching office agree on the Hittite
[1:35:34] holiday we got they must be driven out
[1:35:37] how many believe that they live in the
[1:35:39] vicinity I look where they live in the
[1:35:40] vicinity of Heffron which is in the
[1:35:43] south of Jerusalem by 20 miles Efron was
[1:35:45] where Abe reverse went after separated
[1:35:47] from lot and that's where he had
[1:35:50] association or communion with God so
[1:35:53] fear
[1:35:54] was taking the place of communion with
[1:35:56] God coming on that when you're all
[1:35:58] fearful to scare you don't have the
[1:36:00] communion with God that we need
[1:36:02] may God drive out the fear before we
[1:36:04] have communion next Sunday amen
[1:36:06] that's where they live and so Joshua the
[1:36:09] army oh that's right I all the fear out
[1:36:11] of heaven I'm not in their communion
[1:36:13] with God in other words we have bonus of
[1:36:15] the Damned judgment amen we are with the
[1:36:18] right we are with Christ we are saved
[1:36:19] and we can beat both of the day of
[1:36:21] judgment because we know where we come
[1:36:23] from and we know where we're going amen
[1:36:26] so his eyesight fear that hinders our
[1:36:29] fellowship with God let me know as a
[1:36:31] baptized Holy Ghost filled Saint you
[1:36:33] still gotta battle fear and have
[1:36:36] communion with God I don't know that
[1:36:37] this is still effective actually this
[1:36:40] stuff like me absolutely
[1:36:41] fear what if I preaches who body the
[1:36:44] church I got battle fear what if I do
[1:36:46] this to my children what's gonna happen
[1:36:48] one what if I say this is what if I try
[1:36:49] to teach this what's gonna happen what
[1:36:52] if I tell somebody at work about the
[1:36:53] message if I get get fired on this fear
[1:36:56] but fear must be driven out Amen or else
[1:37:01] we'll never possess the land like we
[1:37:02] ought to and of course we you know
[1:37:04] through all these scripture if your
[1:37:05] hands Foreman perfect love casts out
[1:37:07] fear now I got a lot more on that I got
[1:37:10] a lot more preached on fear so you might
[1:37:13] be ministering on nevela more by God's
[1:37:14] grace okay so so far we got riches and
[1:37:17] we got fear how many believe those are
[1:37:19] real enemies to the Holy Ghost baptized
[1:37:22] Saint and church I'm not making all this
[1:37:24] up I can show you the quote in fact I'll
[1:37:26] share this with Rohit Shetty's that
[1:37:27] brother you know that to me I want to
[1:37:30] preach that he said I'm not a teacher
[1:37:31] but that's really good teach us it was
[1:37:33] the Holy Spirit it's the Holy Spirit
[1:37:35] giving us the Word of God that we need
[1:37:39] here buddies now this is one Hittites
[1:37:44] the actual Hebrew word means villager
[1:37:47] it means at the sending of came the son
[1:37:50] of ham they dwelt five miles from
[1:37:51] Jerusalem's leader even closer than the
[1:37:53] the hit Titus
[1:37:54] now look here max we're actually the
[1:37:57] Gibeonites of Joshua 10 did you know
[1:37:58] that I never knew that guy stood up the
[1:38:01] Hittites were actually the Gibeonites
[1:38:02] they lived in the area or thought of
[1:38:05] Gideon which is right there around
[1:38:06] and remember the city and places of
[1:38:10] giving was greater than ai ai was this
[1:38:14] huge place where they failed because
[1:38:15] they had consent but then overcame akin
[1:38:17] overcome estate the best of sin right
[1:38:20] this was giving was bigger than hey I
[1:38:23] was huge it was a massive place of
[1:38:27] villagers now the Gibeonites when they
[1:38:30] do Church so I'm looking at what they
[1:38:31] did to tighten this one because their
[1:38:32] name doesn't type it out mr. chairman
[1:38:34] the Gibby nice to see Joshua and Israel
[1:38:37] into a false League of peace or
[1:38:39] friendship in order to save their lives
[1:38:42] and God in our D commandeth don't make
[1:38:45] any lead with anybody the Promised Land
[1:38:49] to see the first mistake was aided
[1:38:51] seekers City somebody the church didn't
[1:38:53] confess their sin the second one was the
[1:38:55] leadership made a mistake Joshua why why
[1:38:58] she says Joshua made the oath the
[1:39:00] leadership made a little mistake right
[1:39:02] that must mean to kill Joshua and just
[1:39:05] repent move on right you're right we got
[1:39:09] so I believe this him I spent I'd
[1:39:12] friendship or adultery with the world
[1:39:14] also types compromising I'm never
[1:39:17] battled a compromising spirit forever
[1:39:21] battle friendship with the world the
[1:39:25] Bible said the friendship with the world
[1:39:26] is a Haitian with God this is for the
[1:39:28] believer who's already in the promised
[1:39:30] land
[1:39:31] remember Bellucci reward number saw us
[1:39:34] all three water yet he was saved right
[1:39:37] lost to Oscar or David could have
[1:39:39] stopped was so much more and he not
[1:39:40] polit adultery he reached the pinnacle
[1:39:43] that he felt he never reached it again
[1:39:45] of the sword never left from his house
[1:39:47] the rest of his days he never got back
[1:39:49] to where he was because he had
[1:39:52] friendship with the world this case
[1:39:54] friendship with adultery for if this
[1:40:01] parasite so how many time I got I got
[1:40:03] one minute I'm not gonna finish my
[1:40:04] minute give me five more I know you love
[1:40:07] me because you bear with me they could
[1:40:09] eat every take each measurement let's
[1:40:11] reset your mind that's cool all the time
[1:40:13] every set our minds know
[1:40:14] focus it gives you a refreshing in your
[1:40:17] mind your spirit parasites in Hebrew
[1:40:22] means belonging to a village they
[1:40:24] inhabited southern Canaan parasites were
[1:40:26] farmers and peasants though I put a
[1:40:28] little question mark up this one I'm
[1:40:30] high so what I mean is it wasn't exactly
[1:40:32] clear it was a little bit of a stretch
[1:40:34] but bear with me some of you have to
[1:40:36] service my government tell me some good
[1:40:37] scriptures parasites work the earth and
[1:40:40] there's very little Scripture record and
[1:40:42] that's all that said about David there
[1:40:43] were workers of the earth but remember
[1:40:45] so I put a question mark I'm not like
[1:40:46] the other ones are clearly can see the
[1:40:48] clear about their so clear this seems to
[1:40:50] represent her as I seen the represent
[1:40:52] the green fleshly or carnal because Cain
[1:40:55] worked the earth he brought an offering
[1:40:58] from the earth the serpent would lick
[1:41:01] the dust of the earth earthly things
[1:41:04] carnal things the one talent man went in
[1:41:08] in his god-given gift where in the earth
[1:41:12] and forgot about it so the earth
[1:41:17] represents bearing son represents
[1:41:19] worthiness and bearing what God has
[1:41:22] given to you and forgetting about it
[1:41:26] represents forgetting about the plan of
[1:41:28] God because you're you're so worldly
[1:41:30] minded what about the first thing that
[1:41:34] bought a piece of ground that's the
[1:41:35] excuse me was suffer because it was
[1:41:36] ground ground the earth these were just
[1:41:39] farmers so parasites had carnal worldly
[1:41:42] minded people that have spiritual
[1:41:44] amnesia like that first man with the
[1:41:46] town went buried his down there if he
[1:41:48] forgot he was a a possessor of the Kings
[1:41:51] money he forgot I'm a possessor on the
[1:41:54] promise of God I forgot I'm a possessor
[1:41:57] of a gift of God I've got a gift of God
[1:41:59] and I've got it invest in it if I don't
[1:42:01] invest in it the earth was swallowed it
[1:42:03] up god help us to know that our gifts be
[1:42:06] swallowed up in the earth and that's all
[1:42:09] through the scripture
[1:42:10] oh that could preach a whole sermon on
[1:42:11] that and all and this is a portion where
[1:42:14] he talks about being carnal you got
[1:42:17] stripes and envies and divisions among
[1:42:19] you and some of you say you're a pawn
[1:42:21] some of apollos see that pride there
[1:42:24] to that Berrien things of the earth when
[1:42:27] they bury therapies into they'd love to
[1:42:28] give the godly arm and they went back to
[1:42:30] being Cardinal they just had thoughts
[1:42:33] that were earthly thoughts instead of
[1:42:34] heavenly thoughts they care more about
[1:42:36] their preacher than about Christ its
[1:42:40] carnal that's earthly that's a parasite
[1:42:44] and the Bible said Hebrews 2 if we
[1:42:46] neglect this Holy Ghost ministry then we
[1:42:48] the bomb said we're done we're gonna be
[1:42:50] a bad situation I forget exactly what
[1:42:53] the word is about that we should kind of
[1:42:54] neglect the signs and wonders and
[1:42:55] miracles of this Holy Ghost gospel that
[1:42:58] spiritual amnesia we in other words you
[1:43:00] must pray for God to move we must see
[1:43:02] God we must worship God and love God we
[1:43:05] must draw nigh to God and Hills all
[1:43:06] night into us we cannot neglect the
[1:43:09] channel to minister to God in the
[1:43:11] promised land
[1:43:12] now that you've got the Holy Ghost you
[1:43:14] cannot quit seeking God you must stay
[1:43:16] seeking God you must be heavenly minded
[1:43:18] and not worldly minded you cannot
[1:43:21] neglect this again the spiritual amnesia
[1:43:23] number 5 the girgashites this had the
[1:43:26] least amount of scripture on a gurney
[1:43:28] shots that means swelling in the clay
[1:43:30] soil but I found a good type in here
[1:43:32] glory
[1:43:33] it actually means dwelling on the clay
[1:43:36] soil their exact habitation is not known
[1:43:38] the murder sites were sons of Canaan the
[1:43:40] cursed man of the cursed son of ham
[1:43:43] burger sites lived on the clay burns
[1:43:45] ever recorded now I put a question mark
[1:43:46] but it's becoming more clear to me clay
[1:43:49] represents spiritual instability being
[1:43:53] tossed to and fro uncertain because the
[1:43:56] Bible said I was in the miry clay you
[1:43:59] brought me out of my reclaim and now my
[1:44:01] feet are on the rocking boy so
[1:44:05] girgashite represents somebody was so
[1:44:07] unstable they don't know which way to go
[1:44:09] they're not they're not sure about
[1:44:10] anything in the promised land baptized
[1:44:13] with the Holy Ghost I wonder brother
[1:44:14] have said you can have the bachelor the
[1:44:16] Holy Ghost and be insane because if they
[1:44:19] backside in one spot all these demons
[1:44:22] can come in if they're not careful on
[1:44:24] the church set absolutely
[1:44:27] it's all so tight as one who hears the
[1:44:30] word was not obey because the contrast
[1:44:32] the opposite of clay is luck
[1:44:34] rock
[1:44:35] and Jesus said a person that's on the
[1:44:37] rock hears the word and obeys it so
[1:44:41] someone on the clay hears the word it
[1:44:43] walks away it doesn't do it unstable is
[1:44:47] the unstable organs in stable unstable
[1:44:49] these unstable in state unstable
[1:44:53] unstable person talks to and fro
[1:44:56] constantly wavering back and forth what
[1:44:57] is it it's a double minded man that's
[1:45:00] Holy Ghost sakes knows all the ghosts
[1:45:03] got a bounce how many got a battle that
[1:45:04] sometimes all the time I go this
[1:45:06] direction is a pastor in that direction
[1:45:08] I don't meet the church I leave my
[1:45:09] family and if I'm not careful I can
[1:45:11] become double minded but God gives me
[1:45:13] great Saint
[1:45:14] just got to find that devil off got a
[1:45:17] keyframe he's believed it
[1:45:19] fight off that Gurkha shining net now
[1:45:21] plate also represents you remember it's
[1:45:24] the state the Lord brother man said the
[1:45:26] iron and clay represent the Catholic and
[1:45:28] the Protestant so the clay also
[1:45:31] represents the Protestant denomination
[1:45:34] intermarrying the lukewarm church member
[1:45:36] hey because the irony play
[1:45:39] mingled their seat together but what not
[1:45:41] mix so what does the girgashite it's an
[1:45:45] unstable of lukewarm disobedient church
[1:45:48] member who's tossed to and fro like a
[1:45:50] man tossed on the ocean unstable
[1:45:53] believer and the Holy Spirit said drive
[1:45:56] that out drive that out of your life be
[1:45:59] firm
[1:46:00] these look cool arms I don't be this
[1:46:01] Barbie hot thing that try that lukewarm
[1:46:04] out of your life amen
[1:46:05] good stay we'll find something to stand
[1:46:07] on don't be a pushover be solid by the
[1:46:10] will of God and stay right there stand
[1:46:12] on the rock don't be living in the clay
[1:46:15] don't be living like a church church
[1:46:17] member denies the Word of God stand on
[1:46:20] the rock of rice today
[1:46:22] boy we need some rock standard bar you
[1:46:25] try though those bird shots run most up
[1:46:28] another Lord today thank you for let me
[1:46:31] go it alone it's almost two hours but
[1:46:34] God be praised amen
[1:46:36] this is more than life to me church and
[1:46:39] if you're hungry than say God take away
[1:46:41] my natural hunger give me a more
[1:46:43] spiritual I can say go take a bite come
[1:46:47] back in Matthew 7:21 thousands of this
[1:46:50] we got to stay on the rock someone who's
[1:46:52] on the rock hears the word does it who's
[1:46:55] got the Holy Ghost and the lukewarm
[1:46:56] scripture right here lukewarm their
[1:46:59] works they deny it in their works you
[1:47:00] know sometimes it works or Goods done so
[1:47:02] unstable play okay
[1:47:05] so ends in stable unstable that's not
[1:47:07] sure which way to go
[1:47:09] and rights are you join us I thought I
[1:47:14] said I'm interested to see how the
[1:47:16] church responds with this I hope they
[1:47:18] like it because I like it so much
[1:47:20] amber writes Emmerich's out the nitro
[1:47:23] they had no definition of the Hebrew at
[1:47:25] least on folio views on the message
[1:47:27] software so I had to go to the east of
[1:47:29] our dictionary its Hill Landers or
[1:47:31] Hillman they lived in the mountains of
[1:47:33] southern and central Palestine they were
[1:47:35] the sons and hands are all cursed and
[1:47:37] all these demons are curses all these
[1:47:40] demons you fight they're cursed
[1:47:42] a mirage for some of the last of the
[1:47:44] Giants that's going to do gravity 3:11
[1:47:47] you can look that up there's some of the
[1:47:49] last of the Giants from the land Eastern
[1:47:52] Bible Dictionary said they were warlike
[1:47:53] Mountaineers so there's very these these
[1:47:57] strong soldiers giant soldiers in the
[1:48:00] land so am rights must type out these
[1:48:02] powerful fleshly luster snares that war
[1:48:06] against the soul we become bad habits
[1:48:08] bad fleshly habits that more against the
[1:48:11] soul how many got me understand that
[1:48:13] they war against your very salt church
[1:48:15] that's what first Peter 2:11 says
[1:48:18] abstain from fleshly lusts that war
[1:48:20] against or so how do they make you or
[1:48:22] against your soul you start because of
[1:48:24] your addiction because your bad habits
[1:48:26] are because your problem you start
[1:48:27] doubting that you're even saved and yet
[1:48:30] you claim to be in the promised land
[1:48:32] because of a fleshly powerful us
[1:48:35] that you just hang it over it's a giant
[1:48:37] lust in your life how many know Christ
[1:48:39] gives the things off Christ will give
[1:48:41] you victory over lust it must be
[1:48:43] starving then you must starve that black
[1:48:46] dog
[1:48:47] you must drive out that black dog you
[1:48:49] must speak to that black dog you must
[1:48:51] have a booty man you must tell the devil
[1:48:54] the Word of God we stopped a fleeting
[1:48:56] then speak the word of that child in
[1:48:59] your life and watch it go speak to that
[1:49:00] mountain and watch a movie man how this
[1:49:04] happened again last night you guys can
[1:49:05] call me crazy but I had a headache it
[1:49:07] was getting worse and worse throughout
[1:49:08] the day I went down the study about 6
[1:49:10] p.m. and I'm reading these quotes I just
[1:49:12] got upset with this headache I just
[1:49:14] closed my eyes and I said in the name of
[1:49:15] Jesus Christ I'm coming again just like
[1:49:17] that sickness that vomiting that come
[1:49:19] upon me last week I said again in the
[1:49:21] name of Jesus Christ this headache is
[1:49:24] going to leave Satan I saw this that you
[1:49:26] parents either arrested you're getting
[1:49:27] behind in the name of Jesus Christ

[1:49:30] I had all day and it changed my diet I
[1:49:34] did do that
[1:49:35] everyone said we need faith to even cast
[1:49:37] out headaches in humanity we start
[1:49:40] getting there not speaking the word then
[1:49:41] we're getting close to rapturing faith
[1:49:43] day oh yeah right
[1:49:46] but these powerful lastly habits that
[1:49:49] look like Chinese in our lives we got to
[1:49:52] drive them out because they will war
[1:49:54] against your soul I thought I was saving
[1:49:57] because you're such a slave to your
[1:49:59] flesh and then wars against you the
[1:50:05] Bible said we're your Wars come from the
[1:50:07] lusts of your members Jamie said that
[1:50:10] where the words come from is joy Holden
[1:50:11] goes to church your lust
[1:50:13] start a war with brother banish sorrow
[1:50:15] brother Ivan or start a war they got
[1:50:17] more money than you or they're more
[1:50:19] handsome than me they got it you know
[1:50:22] that the people get jealous number
[1:50:23] jealousy starts most wars understand and
[1:50:29] then Paul says flee youthful lusts just
[1:50:34] run from them they are so gigantic
[1:50:36] like I said open up a bottle and you
[1:50:38] open up open up a can of worms right
[1:50:40] it's like still milk you've given one
[1:50:43] time to a live startline watched your
[1:50:44] life you give into cocaine one time
[1:50:47] watch them you
[1:50:47] it's gonna kill them flee father run
[1:50:51] from it don't try to fight that giant
[1:50:52] let Jesus defeat that giant don't let
[1:50:56] that giant in let Christ Drive them out
[1:50:58] that's not least I know you're having to
[1:51:01] be done here I'm not really happy but
[1:51:03] happy to get to these seven now Church
[1:51:06] you can see I'm not making these up this
[1:51:08] is just straight from the Hebrew and
[1:51:09] it's straight from the Bible
[1:51:11] dictionaries just looking at what they
[1:51:13] were and look into the type for our
[1:51:14] lives we can clearly see this I mean
[1:51:17] every words inspired the Bob Schneider
[1:51:19] words problem for doctrine right
[1:51:22] instruction training righteous that the
[1:51:23] man of God woman of God may be perfect
[1:51:25] yes send us the final thing we must
[1:51:28] drive out at least according to this
[1:51:29] Joshua this Joshua age Jeffy's eyes
[1:51:34] Hebrew means son of Jews G boozy muscle
[1:51:39] they work a nice to occupy Jerusalem
[1:51:42] they were actually in a very central
[1:51:44] center worship Jerusalem God's brought a
[1:51:46] place of worship and this to me is
[1:51:49] really interesting it's not man on this
[1:51:52] report Easton's Bible dictionary said
[1:51:53] Jay bus had been fastness or drunkle so
[1:52:01] what is it Jeffy's I type roots of
[1:52:03] bitterness I preach on that recently
[1:52:05] complexes or mental strongholds this is
[1:52:08] not addiction still us this is just a
[1:52:10] mental stronghold that someone has built
[1:52:14] up against so-and-so going up against
[1:52:16] this the jetty site is a stronghold a
[1:52:21] stronghold and complexes must be driven
[1:52:25] out yes according to these remember Esau
[1:52:30] of us had a route of interest as the
[1:52:31] Bible said he failed the grace of God he
[1:52:34] was bitter against remember he's been
[1:52:35] against Jacob he's bitter against his
[1:52:37] parents we went in married to Hittite
[1:52:39] women or the Hittites again he went
[1:52:41] married to Hittite women on purpose to
[1:52:43] spite his mother and father he had such
[1:52:46] a complex such a brutal be restored his
[1:52:48] parents and then second Corinthians
[1:52:51] talks about how we must cast out every
[1:52:53] imagination we must cast on the Bible
[1:52:55] literally says strongholds Holy Ghost
[1:52:58] those things if they're not careful
[1:52:59] Satan will get a
[1:53:01] their minds and have a strong blow in
[1:53:02] their mind against something else or
[1:53:04] somebody else and that was the seventh
[1:53:07] one listed by God in Joshua 3 tip let's
[1:53:11] say an or feet I'm gonna stop right
[1:53:14] there
[1:53:14] but as you're standing how many listen
[1:53:16] to the supernatural lately I found this
[1:53:18] so striking we listen do we just
[1:53:19] finished it last month I think my own
[1:53:22] Jordan
[1:53:24] chapter 89 I know because Samson and
[1:53:28] Shannon I listened to it this week I'm
[1:53:30] driving around I said I want us in that
[1:53:32] chapter on the complex new chapter 89
[1:53:36] it's the title of something along the
[1:53:38] lines of his last great temptation
[1:53:40] speaking of brother Brandon's
[1:53:49] you
[1:56:36] and he said he sees a vision he sees a
[1:56:41] vision of himself as that man with the
[1:56:43] big kachou east knees the mountain man
[1:56:46] program carry out your plans and you'll
[1:56:50] be just like that man
[1:56:52] all alone in dirty clothes living on the
[1:56:55] mountain no one that no one with no wife
[1:56:57] no nothing like that
[1:56:59] remember that a complex would drive him
[1:57:03] away from the people that he loved the
[1:57:05] people God has sent to you understand if
[1:57:08] he didn't get victory over this complex
[1:57:09] he never could have delivered the
[1:57:11] message to the people he preached the
[1:57:13] 1964 night in the fall this is later
[1:57:19] complex is a mayor battle to overcome I
[1:57:27] said somebody attacks you're a great
[1:57:30] example you know for your family I said
[1:57:34] your thanks really touched my heart I've
[1:57:36] had a conference against you and all
[1:57:37] your brothers with everybody like this

[1:57:51] just went up and tried to give him some
[1:57:52] money
[1:57:52] they wanted to take it like that but
[1:57:56] then they ripped it up later they said
[1:58:00] here generosity and I see that I build
[1:58:02] up a complex in my life for you you know

[1:58:14] myself and my brothers and everybody I
[1:58:17] did that just God knows my heart I just
[1:58:20] felt led to show some love in this

[1:58:24] do something nice for them and I just
[1:58:26] want to text them and I'm thinking about

[1:58:40] complex about this person I don't know
