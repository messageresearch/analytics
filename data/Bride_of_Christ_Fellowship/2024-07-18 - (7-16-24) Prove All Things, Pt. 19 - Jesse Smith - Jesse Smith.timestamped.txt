[0:00] verses five and six God bless our live
[0:03] streamers we're to look at proving all
[0:05] things uh part 19
[0:08] tonight going to focus on uh a statement
[0:10] brother random makes he makes a
[0:13] statement and says uh the Elijah for
[0:16] today is the Lord Jesus Christ and many
[0:18] people misunderstand this it seems uh
[0:22] people actually on both sides of the of
[0:24] the message whether you're uh whether
[0:26] people uh uh uh press play and Obey or
[0:30] whether people are against the message
[0:31] of brother Bram people on both sides
[0:33] misinterpret this quote from my
[0:35] perspective and opinion so I'm going to
[0:37] preach uh on this tonight and give us a
[0:41] good balance hopefully uh by the grace
[0:43] of God and then if we have time we'll
[0:44] look at uh avoiding uh Vain babblings
[0:47] and foolish questions uh by God's
[0:51] grace so Malachi 45 and 6 of course we
[0:54] know this is a scripture we believe uh
[0:56] God used brother Ram to fulfill the
[0:58] second part of verse six to turn the
[1:01] heart of the children to the fathers
[1:03] because we know John the Baptist turned
[1:05] the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:07] children what fathers it had to been the
[1:09] uh the original uh we'd say the
[1:12] apostolic Saints right that were alive
[1:15] uh right at time of Jesus's death burial
[1:17] and Resurrection the fathers of the
[1:19] faith we'd call them U the early
[1:21] Apostles the book of Acts Church John
[1:23] the Baptist pointed everybody right he
[1:25] pointed them to Christ Hallelujah and
[1:27] that in turn as he pointed them toist
[1:29] Christ and then their hearts were turned
[1:32] to the second coming of Jesus and that's
[1:34] what the children represents uh the the
[1:37] generation that would see his return to
[1:38] the Earth right John the Baptist turned
[1:41] the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:43] children uh and so the Bible never the
[1:46] Bible never uh Records anyone fulfilling
[1:50] that second
[1:51] part Bible never records anyone uh
[1:54] turning the heart of the children to the
[1:56] father so we have to look at other
[1:57] scriptures to see how this is fulfilled
[1:59] and of course it's fulfilled in uh
[2:01] Matthew 17:11 and Revelation 10:7 and
[2:05] other verses Luke 17:30 verses we're
[2:08] familiar with uh but let's read this
[2:10] here and we'll have you be seated by
[2:11] God's grace Malachi 45
[2:14] and6 I'll read verse 5 then you can read
[2:17] verse six with me verse 5 says behold I
[2:19] will send you Elijah the prophet before
[2:22] the coming of the great and Dreadful day
[2:24] of the Lord let's read verse 6 1 2 3 and
[2:27] he shall turn the heart of the fathers
[2:30] to the children and the Heart of the
[2:33] children to their fathers I come and
[2:36] smite the Earth amen let's have one more
[2:39] word of prayer if we can here by God's
[2:40] grace father God we thank you again for
[2:42] today we thank you for Calvary Mercy
[2:44] there was great and Grace was free
[2:47] pardon there was multiplied to me Lord
[2:50] so thank you Lord that your pardon was
[2:52] multiplied to us Lord God we love what
[2:54] Romans uh 4 says Lord David describes
[2:58] the blessedness of this man to whom the
[3:01] Lord will not impute sin Hallelujah he
[3:03] will not remember his sins and
[3:05] iniquities oh God let that be us Lord
[3:06] God that we would be so blessed you
[3:08] would not remember our sins and our
[3:10] iniquities Lord because of the blood of
[3:12] Jesus Christ because of faith alone in
[3:14] the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah we
[3:15] love the scripture we love Ephesians 2
[3:18] 8-10 Lord God saved by grace through
[3:20] faith it is not of works but the gift of
[3:22] God hallelujah that no man should boast
[3:24] Lord God so we thank you for tonight
[3:26] Lord just guide me anoint me here Lord
[3:28] God For Your Glory bless the life live
[3:29] streamers and those present here and
[3:31] those might listen on the archive in
[3:33] Jesus Christ's name the church said amen
[3:36] amen God bless you as you're being
[3:37] seated there praise
[3:46] God so you know it was just interesting
[3:49] this morning after I prayed and I was
[3:51] studying that this thought just kind of
[3:52] came to me I got an email and it
[3:54] mentioned this quote and as I just I
[3:56] just meditated on for a few moments and
[3:59] it's one of those moment moment where I
[4:00] just felt the Holy Ghost just opened it
[4:02] up to me I just you know sometimes I I I
[4:05] have all these plans I'm going to do
[4:06] this video that topic or I'm going to
[4:07] study that and then all of a sudden God
[4:09] will just put one in there I wasn't even
[4:10] planning on and it seems like it just
[4:12] opened up to me and so um that's what
[4:15] happened today I was going to study on
[4:16] another topic but then uh this thought
[4:19] came to me and it just seemed like it
[4:21] started opening up to me so I just try
[4:23] to follow the leadership of the Holy
[4:25] Spirit I can tell when God's opening up
[4:27] something because I didn't expect it
[4:28] right you you know you look for the if
[4:31] the Holy Spirit surprises you then you
[4:32] say praise the Lord you know if he's
[4:34] going to bring you a fresh Revelation
[4:35] you want to thank God for that
[4:38] Hallelujah now uh if we could you know
[4:41] we'll just briefly look at this here U
[4:43] notice it's the spirit of Elijah on a
[4:46] prophet we know the spirit of Elijah was
[4:47] on John the Baptist according to Luke
[4:49] 1:17 the Bible says that and John
[4:52] fulfilled the first part fathers to the
[4:54] children but notice God never came and
[4:56] smoke the Earth with a curse yet mhm
[4:58] right still blessed look out look at all
[5:00] the rain we got this week our Earth is
[5:01] blessed it hasn't been cursed and so uh
[5:05] uh so God had to send Elijah again to
[5:08] turn the hearts of the children the
[5:10] Believers of the second coming of Christ
[5:12] back to their fathers and so that means
[5:15] uh their hearts will be turned turned
[5:17] back to Paul's gospel praise God that's
[5:20] what's happened in this day that's what
[5:22] brother Ram came to do brother Ram said
[5:23] my absolute is the word of God uh he
[5:26] said God's absolute is the word of God
[5:28] hallelujah so if God has and brother man
[5:30] said God only has one absolute there's
[5:32] not two absolutes there's only one
[5:33] absolute praise God and so we recognize
[5:37] that and uh brother Ram said his message
[5:40] came to restore our hearts back to the
[5:42] Pentecostal fathers in other words the
[5:44] book of Acts teaching and Paul's letters
[5:46] and Peter's letters James letters all
[5:48] the New Testament Letters by the grace
[5:50] of God and how many can say Amen they
[5:52] believe brother am did that amen amen
[5:54] without a doubt I have no doubts in my
[5:56] mind at all by God's grace that's what
[5:58] studying does that's what waiting on God
[6:00] does it dissolves all your doubts amen
[6:03] you study you pray you wait on God God
[6:05] gives you Revelation it dissolves all
[6:07] the doubts Allelujah I have no doubts
[6:08] about water baptism or the godhead or
[6:10] serpent seed I have no doubts about that
[6:12] Hallelujah God has dissolved my doubts
[6:14] amen I don't understand everything I
[6:16] don't have every answer but I know the
[6:17] Revelation is Right
[6:19] Hallelujah and
[6:21] so and so the uh the the point of this
[6:25] uh video I made today and of course this
[6:27] the study was on this quote brother
[6:29] makes it's uh November 27th 65 trying to
[6:32] do God a service without being his will
[6:34] and brother man makes a statement he
[6:36] said but the Elijah of this day is the
[6:39] Lord Jesus
[6:41] Christ he's come according to and then
[6:44] he says Luke 17:30 right in the days of
[6:47] the son of man says the son of man is to
[6:50] reveal himself among his people not a
[6:52] man God and brother screams it out
[6:56] God he says but it'll come through a
[6:59] prophet now that's just a very small
[7:00] section now like I said people on both
[7:03] sides of the message remember we're
[7:05] trying to say right down the middle of
[7:06] the road we're trying to stay right with
[7:08] the word of God right you know there's
[7:10] two sides right uh people worship
[7:11] Brother brandom people revile brother
[7:14] brandom but we know brother BR was a
[7:16] true prophet of God Amen
[7:18] right and so the people that worship
[7:21] brother Braham they'll say look uh and
[7:22] there was people that admit this and
[7:24] they got an on tape that have now passed
[7:26] on Friends of brother brandom said that
[7:29] brother brand was God that's heresy
[7:32] right uh if I can think of a name I
[7:34] might call it because he already passed
[7:35] away I don't know if I can call it it'll
[7:37] come to
[7:38] me I'll just have to wait on that but be
[7:41] and this is the quote they would use
[7:43] these worshippers of Brother brandom The
[7:44] Press Play obey people the no preacher
[7:47] people this is the quote they would use
[7:48] they say the Elijah this day is the Lord
[7:50] Jesus Christ and they would try to say
[7:52] brother Ram was God that's absolute
[7:54] heresy that could be blasphemy that'll
[7:57] be up to God to decide that right
[8:01] and so uh they take the quote the wrong
[8:04] side now the other side the people that
[8:06] revile brother bandam or uh attack
[8:08] brother brandham they'll they'll say see
[8:11] brother bram's trying to say he is a
[8:13] lord Jesus Christ he can't be trusted
[8:15] he's a false prophet that's wrong they
[8:18] they've misinterpreted the quote so like
[8:20] I said I didn't even plan on studying
[8:22] this today that's why I feel like it's
[8:24] God
[8:25] okay um so you might be saying well
[8:28] brother Jess uh you better tell us what
[8:30] this means I said that's what I'm going
[8:31] to do by God's grace but to understand
[8:34] this you know you have to go two
[8:36] paragraphs above this statement see
[8:40] people can take one snippet of a
[8:42] statement and make make it say whatever
[8:43] they want and put they Peter said that's
[8:46] what they did to Paul they would twist
[8:48] his scriptures the word is actually rest
[8:50] wre s t in second Peter chapter 3 they
[8:53] would rest they would twist the
[8:55] scripture and make it say something it
[8:56] doesn't say brother man's not saying
[8:58] he's the Lord Jesus Christ brother is
[9:00] saying the spirit of Elijah is the holy
[9:03] spirit that's what he said it's that
[9:05] simple right right the spirit of Elijah
[9:08] can't be some other Spirit like a spirit
[9:10] of a man that wouldn't help anybody
[9:12] right it can't it's not the spirit of
[9:13] the devil we know that that'd be
[9:15] blasphemy the spirit of Elijah is just
[9:17] the spirit of God with certain
[9:19] attributes for certain Ministries that's
[9:21] right and if you know your Bible real
[9:23] well you'll know there's only one Spirit
[9:26] but there's different uh there's
[9:27] different uh attributes of the same Holy
[9:30] Spirit remember uh Psalm chapter 1
[9:34] there's rivers of one water brother said
[9:36] that means there's different channels of
[9:38] the same spirit and then he names the
[9:40] nine gifts of the Spirit he said
[9:43] preaching is a different Channel than
[9:45] Divine Healing it's a little different
[9:47] River it's a little different Brook
[9:49] Hallelujah brother it took it took him
[9:51] time to transition from teaching to
[9:54] praying for the sick because it's a
[9:56] different anointing he said and that
[9:58] example is from the uh the sermon the
[10:01] message of
[10:03] Grace so if you haven't listened to that
[10:05] you need to listen to that and let me
[10:06] just say something here you know our
[10:07] church most of us weren't raised in the
[10:09] message so we and I've told this to
[10:10] people too I think I even said it
[10:12] publicly I said we've got to build
[10:14] listening brother Brandon more into our
[10:15] lives because we weren't raised that
[10:18] way whereas other people that were
[10:20] raised that way they're too much on
[10:22] tapes and they got to build more Bible
[10:23] reading into their lives the church said
[10:27] right so you have to build listening to
[10:30] brother brandom into your life if not
[10:31] you're just you're going to miss out on
[10:33] so much right you might be confused on
[10:35] quotes like this
[10:37] right so you have to have the healthy
[10:39] balance now people might even attack me
[10:41] for that statement but then how do you
[10:43] justify how many tapes does it tape to
[10:45] be a good tape follower a good Christian
[10:47] a good message believer how many
[10:49] justifies me when am I justified by
[10:51] listening to enough
[10:53] tapes and then we could say well uh well
[10:56] you're not justified unless you do so
[10:57] many chapters a day see so you got to
[11:00] have the right balance of the Holy
[11:01] Spirit praise God right right but we
[11:03] know if we W raise the message we've got
[11:05] to make an active uh effort to listen to
[11:08] more of the tapes than we would right by
[11:11] God's grace we have to make a active uh
[11:14] effort in that I hope you understand
[11:16] what I'm saying by God's grace
[11:19] amen now there's four reasons that this
[11:22] quote is misunderstood the first is the
[11:24] context brother Rand is talking about
[11:26] the spirit of Elijah is the spirit of
[11:29] the Lord Jesus Christ that's what he's
[11:31] talking about if you know your Bibles
[11:32] remember there's one Spirit but there's
[11:34] nine gifts and then remember at the
[11:35] Throne of God in the seventh Dimension
[11:37] there's seven spirits around the throne
[11:39] and then there's four Cher rooms brother
[11:40] said those four cherom are four
[11:41] anointings for the
[11:43] church is that something you have seven
[11:46] fires that represent the Holy Ghost to
[11:48] every Church age but then you have four
[11:50] anointings that cover those Church ages
[11:53] and give them certain
[11:55] attributes right but how many spirits
[11:57] are there there's only one Holy Spirit
[11:59] amen but there's a holy spirit that will
[12:01] anoint you for a certain age Hallelujah
[12:03] a certain life a certain type of
[12:05] testimony like Elijah right right
[12:07] brother uses brother tells us the Bible
[12:09] says the spirit of Elijah used five
[12:12] times right Elijah Elisha uh John the
[12:16] Baptist the seven Church age messenger
[12:18] or the Malachi 46 turning the hearts of
[12:20] the children back to the fathers and
[12:22] then Moses and Elijah in Revelation 11
[12:25] yeah it's not five different Spirits
[12:27] it's the same Spirit praise God amen and
[12:30] if you've never done that study you need
[12:31] to I got a video on it brother brandom
[12:33] had so many qualities just like Elijah
[12:35] man of the Wilderness spoke with thus
[12:37] sayith the Lord he rebuked those famous
[12:39] women those
[12:41] Jezebels Hallelujah and then when the
[12:43] anointing left he he was a man too he
[12:46] could fall short of God's glory he could
[12:47] question God there's five or six
[12:49] attributes I can I can name four right
[12:51] there right like that he was just like
[12:53] Elijah
[12:55] Hallelujah so we're thankful for that
[12:57] now if you go to paragraphs from this
[13:00] brother starts off with Amos 37 what is
[13:02] Amos 37 God surely God will do nothing
[13:04] except he reveals a secret to his
[13:06] servants theet prophets so in the
[13:08] context brother is talking about God
[13:10] sending a spirit to anoint the prophets
[13:13] he's not saying the prophets are God
[13:15] he's saying God is anointing the
[13:17] prophets amen and then he names Malachi
[13:20] 45 and 6 turn the hearts of the children
[13:23] back to the fathers one paragraph above
[13:25] this he says in the last day the spirit
[13:28] of Elijah is to come too it must come
[13:30] five times God uses that
[13:34] Spirit okay so he's talking he's clearly
[13:36] talking about God using the spirit of
[13:39] Elijah to anoint five different men okay
[13:44] then brother said that Spirit wasn't
[13:47] Elijah that was God's spirit on Elijah
[13:50] that's
[13:52] right any honest person would admit well
[13:55] I was talking about how prophets have to
[13:57] have the anointing of the Holy Ghost
[14:00] or else they can't be a prophet
[14:02] amen and see and there that's why people
[14:05] are guilty of slandering brother random
[14:06] if they're making him say something he's
[14:08] not saying right I know he's from
[14:10] Kentucky I know he wasn't well educated
[14:12] but you still got to do deal do your due
[14:15] diligence and look at the context of
[14:17] what he's saying praise God amen amen
[14:19] hallelujah
[14:20] amen and then he says see it was Elijah
[14:23] was just a man we've had Elijah and
[14:25] Elijah's coats and Elijah's mantel and
[14:27] Elijah's everything
[14:30] he said then but then but but then he
[14:31] says but the Elijah of this day is the
[14:33] Lord Jesus Christ he's to come according
[14:36] to Luke 1730 the son of man is to reveal
[14:38] himself among his people now remember he
[14:41] had to Jesus had to come as son of man
[14:42] and brother Braham because Jesus had
[14:44] never come to the Gentiles yet with that
[14:46] Messiah sign with the discernment gift
[14:49] he only did it to the Jews in John
[14:51] chapter 1 and the Samaritans in John
[14:53] chapter 4 you're getting a good Bible
[14:55] teaching tonight amen HJ this is the
[14:57] Holy Spirit by got it's the Revelation
[14:59] for this day praise God it's not a
[15:01] denominational Revelation you won't find
[15:02] it in these men's books you'll find it
[15:04] preached by the prophet of God
[15:06] hallelujah am with thus sayith the Lord
[15:08] hallelujah yeah amen that's right
[15:10] remember said in the anointed ones the
[15:11] end time he said Malachi 4:5 and6 is on
[15:14] the Earth right now thus sayith the Lord
[15:17] but said search every newspaper search
[15:19] he said look at the ministry of Elijah
[15:22] on the Earth today with science Miracles
[15:23] and wonders thus sayith the lord it's on
[15:25] the Earth right now Church we've been
[15:26] given the message of the hour praise God
[15:29] we got the right baptism like we said
[15:30] the godhead we got all the Mysteries
[15:32] finished hallelujah praise God we've
[15:34] been given a blessing from the Lord the
[15:36] word of God has been restored hallelujah
[15:39] oh makes me happy to know I'm a part of
[15:41] that to know that God would choose me to
[15:43] open my blinded eyes to see it by the
[15:45] grace of God and choose you hallelujah
[15:47] amen blessed are your eyes for they see
[15:49] blessed are your ears for they hear
[15:51] hallelujah
[15:53] amen then he says he says not a man God
[15:57] so brother's looking at Luke 17:30 says
[15:59] not a man it's not a man that's going to
[16:01] do this son of man it's God in the man
[16:04] that's right just like God anointing
[16:06] Elijah amen amen just like God anointing
[16:09] Elisha or John the Baptist amen or Moses
[16:12] and Elijah it's God anointing the man he
[16:14] said but it'll come through a prophet
[16:17] it's God coming through a prophet amen
[16:20] why can't they see that praise God and
[16:21] they always cut off that last part but
[16:23] it'll come through a prophet I'm talking
[16:25] about the people that attack they attack
[16:27] brother Bram they always cut off that
[16:29] part see it's God coming through a
[16:31] prophet that's how God always came so
[16:34] started at Moses right the people said
[16:36] we don't want to hear from God God said
[16:38] fine I'll give you a prophet I'll speak
[16:39] through Moses amen and God has done that
[16:41] ever since yeah that's why God sent
[16:44] brother brandom Hallelujah to speak to
[16:46] us and remember oh if you haven't read
[16:47] this let's read 2 Chronicles 36 haven't
[16:50] read this for a while this is a great
[16:51] blessing boy when I found this I was so
[16:53] happy 2 Chronicles
[16:57] 36 maybe Malachi have you read this
[16:59] buddy cuz nice to hear some other voices
[17:01] here uh 36 I believe it's 15 and 16 if
[17:05] I'm not mistaken yeah can you read 15
[17:07] and
[17:08] 16 and the Lord God of their fathers
[17:11] sent them sent to them by his Messengers
[17:13] rising up in times and sending because
[17:15] he had compassion on his people and on
[17:17] his dwelling place but they mocked The
[17:19] Messengers of God and despised his words
[17:21] and misused His prophets until the Wrath
[17:23] of the Lord arose against his people so
[17:26] there was no remedy and the church said
[17:29] why did God send brother brandom he
[17:30] wouldn't have compassion on
[17:33] us I'm sure my wife and I would say it
[17:35] was God's compassion to show us not to
[17:38] wear makeup that was God's compassion
[17:41] yes on my wife it was God's compassion
[17:44] to show me to cut off my long hair
[17:47] that's God's compassion so I don't look
[17:48] like a woman amen hallelujah that was
[17:51] God's compassion to call me out of
[17:53] denominational churches or mega churches
[17:55] that you know would allow you to
[17:56] basically get drunk that was God
[17:59] compassion amen amen amen is everybody
[18:01] with me
[18:02] tonight that's God's compassion to give
[18:04] you the word of God so you can really
[18:06] really live a holy Sanctified Life
[18:08] church amen that's God's compassion to
[18:11] us amen but they don't want it if they
[18:13] reject brother they don't want the
[18:14] compassion of God shame on them
[18:16] hallelujah amen they're rejecting the
[18:18] word
[18:19] hallelujah right and what do they do and
[18:21] and and this is the people not everybody
[18:24] but but look at these people if they
[18:25] mock The Messengers if they despise the
[18:28] word of God that The Messengers saying
[18:31] they misus the prophets and here's a
[18:33] exact this is the topic is that's the
[18:35] example they misus brother Ram's words
[18:38] he wasn't calling himself the Lord Jesus
[18:40] Christ he was saying the Lord Jesus
[18:42] Christ has to anoint this man who's got
[18:43] the spirit of Elijah Hallelujah the
[18:46] spirit of Elijah is equal to the Holy
[18:48] Spirit and the Holy Spirit is equal to
[18:49] the Lord Jesus Christ it's the Lord
[18:52] Jesus Christ in spirit form
[18:54] hallelujah amen hallelujah Glory
[19:00] I'm feeling religious tonight hallelujah
[19:02] praise God he said it'll come through a
[19:04] prophet now he skips down I'm skipping
[19:06] down a few a few lines here he said God
[19:09] has to get one man under his control so
[19:11] he's talking about God controlling
[19:14] prophets see there's one God there was
[19:16] father son Holy Ghost but one God over
[19:17] it all notice so he was with Elijah the
[19:21] spirit of Elijah he used that Spirit but
[19:23] the same God controlling it all the time
[19:26] to fulfill his word amen so see friends
[19:30] anyone who's honest and look at look at
[19:32] looks at the context they know brother
[19:34] raham is not exalting himself and on the
[19:37] video I have a whole section how brother
[19:38] always humbled
[19:40] himself let me just read them now some
[19:42] of them are familiar you've heard me
[19:44] preach them over the last few weeks
[19:46] brother said in the seventh
[19:47] seal we want to be gems in the crown of
[19:50] Jesus Christ we don't want to never put
[19:54] a man in it you forget anything about me
[19:56] I'm your brother a sinner saved by grace
[19:58] not fit to live that's exactly the truth
[20:01] I ain't saying that to be humble that's
[20:02] facts there's nothing in me not one
[20:05] sound thing at all and the church said
[20:08] amen but said I'm not saying that to be
[20:10] humble that's facts that's right what's
[20:13] he talking about his sin
[20:14] nature amen but then the Bible said his
[20:17] soul never Sinn that in the first place
[20:19] amen right but he's he's looking at he's
[20:22] he's saying don't give any credit to the
[20:24] opening of these seals don't give any
[20:25] credit to me he said put this grace on
[20:28] Jesus Christ amen he says that later in
[20:30] this sermon the seven seal amen he said
[20:32] don't put this credit on me it wasn't me
[20:35] remember he said even at the opening of
[20:36] the first seal he said I would have made
[20:37] an awful mistake this morning if it
[20:39] wasn't for about 12:00 when the Holy
[20:41] Spirit came in the room and corrected me
[20:43] on something I was fixing to say that
[20:45] was wrong amen amen that's right he said
[20:47] I was going to take my text from a
[20:48] previous time I preached the seals and I
[20:50] was going to call the white horse rider
[20:52] the Holy Spirit but then the Holy Spirit
[20:54] came and said it's not me it's the
[20:55] Antichrist spirit amen that's right he
[20:58] said is that deceiver the white horse
[21:00] rider is the deceiver Hallelujah that
[21:02] innocent looking deceiver it's the
[21:04] Antichrist Spirit and the Holy Ghost
[21:06] corrected him that's what I love about
[21:07] God if we love God if we're seeking God
[21:09] God will correct us
[21:12] hallelujah
[21:16] amen what other preacher or even today
[21:18] says that you forget anything about me
[21:22] they're like you better give me your
[21:23] tithes and offerings that's what they're
[21:24] saying today you better build my kingdom
[21:25] and we're World Changers and we're going
[21:27] to yeah while women are bobbing their
[21:29] hair and it's a shame it's a
[21:31] repulse right wearing makeup and sexy
[21:33] clothes in the churches and we're going
[21:34] to be World Changers not for the Holy
[21:36] Ghost not for the fullness of the Holy
[21:38] Ghost right I hope some people get saved
[21:41] in there but Jesus said few there be
[21:43] that find
[21:44] it the narrow road where they actually
[21:46] love the word of God they love Jesus
[21:50] Christ
[21:55] Hallelujah I love this one if you hav
[21:57] this one for a while you'll you'll
[21:58] rejoice the anointed ones of the end
[21:59] time brother man
[22:03] said he said uh I have no more to do
[22:06] with it than nothing no more than just a
[22:08] voice and my voice even against my
[22:10] better judgment I wanted to be a Trapper
[22:12] but it's the will of my father that I
[22:14] declare to do and determine to do
[22:16] speaking of the message I wasn't the one
[22:18] that appeared down at the river now
[22:20] girls we didn't have a chance to go down
[22:21] to the river by Spring Street okay but
[22:23] that's where I baptized Jose you've been
[22:25] there brother yeah that's what he's
[22:26] talking about it wasn't me that appeared
[22:28] there it was the pillar of fire that
[22:29] appeared
[22:30] there I was only standing there when he
[22:33] appeared I'm not the one that performs
[22:35] these things and foretells these things
[22:37] that happens as perfect as they are
[22:39] brother man told that woman Marilyn
[22:41] Hickey he said if you believe you'll
[22:43] have a child thus sayith the Lord she
[22:45] had to wait 10 years but she received it
[22:48] Hallelujah brother said these women will
[22:49] continue to strip themselves that's thus
[22:51] sayith the Lord and hasn't it happened
[22:54] that's a man who knew what he was
[22:55] talking about that's a man who'd been in
[22:58] the presence of somebody greater than
[22:59] just a denominational president or CEO
[23:02] or something like that that's a man who'
[23:03] been the presence of Jesus Hallelujah
[23:06] that's a man that seen Jesus Hallelujah
[23:08] by a uh by Vision
[23:10] Hallelujah that's right see that's what
[23:12] he says perfectly he said I'm only the
[23:17] one that's near when he does
[23:19] it but said he's the one doing
[23:22] everything I'm just standing there when
[23:23] he does it hallelujah amen I was only a
[23:26] voice that he used to say it it wasn't
[23:29] what I knew it's just what I surrendered
[23:31] myself to and he spoke through me that's
[23:34] right amen it isn't mean it wasn't the
[23:37] seven Angel no no see see he recognized
[23:39] he's the seventh angel this quote it's a
[23:41] good quote Oh no it was the
[23:43] manifestation or the appearing of the
[23:45] son of man the appearing of Jesus Christ
[23:47] in the form of a prophet that's right it
[23:51] wasn't the
[23:52] angel it was his message it was the
[23:54] mystery that God unfolded it's not a man
[23:57] it's God the angel was not the son of
[23:59] man he was the messenger from the son of
[24:01] man the son of man is Christ he's the
[24:04] one that you're feeding on you're not
[24:06] feeding on a man his words will fail but
[24:08] you're feeding on the unfailing body
[24:11] word of the son of man amen hallelujah
[24:14] praise godes that's why I told the
[24:17] Saints in Kentucky you got to hear the
[24:19] voice behind the voice of brother Ram
[24:21] that's right cuz brother said my voice
[24:23] my words can fail he said but when God
[24:25] speaks through me that's not me talking
[24:27] that's God talking amen same thing is
[24:29] true when when I finally yield to myself
[24:31] right when when I can finally yield to
[24:32] the Holy Spirit then God can speak
[24:34] something right to you praise God that
[24:36] you need to hear the same same thing
[24:38] with any preacher this is always the way
[24:39] the fivefold ministry has been when they
[24:41] can yield to the Holy Ghost it now it
[24:43] becomes God voice that's right because
[24:45] revelation 22 says the spirit and the
[24:47] bride say come and brother said the
[24:48] spirit and the bride and the prophet
[24:50] will all be saying the same thing and
[24:52] what they are saying has already been
[24:54] said in the word of God Amen Hallelujah
[24:57] praise God Amen
[24:58] that's a church age Book quote if you
[25:00] don't know that one amen time to get in
[25:02] the church age book if you haven't read
[25:03] that one for a while they'll all be
[25:05] saying the same thing and what's already
[25:07] said is in the word of God Amen in other
[25:09] words the bride will stay with the word
[25:11] of God because she's led by the holy
[25:13] spirit amen but says she has to because
[25:16] she's got the Holy Ghost and the Holy
[25:17] Ghost wrote the word amen and the Holy
[25:20] Ghost is not going to say something
[25:21] outside the word of God
[25:24] hallelujah oh hallelujah thank you Jesus
[25:27] brother said if you haven't fed fully on
[25:29] every word to give yourself strength to
[25:31] Fly Above All these denominations and
[25:33] things of the world will you at this
[25:35] time do it while we
[25:38] pray I love it amen see I came out of
[25:41] denomination that's why I love it amen
[25:43] cuz I have done that I'm not feeding on
[25:46] denominational food I'm feeding on the
[25:48] body word of the son of man I'm feeding
[25:51] on the Holy Ghost word for this hour
[25:53] hallelujah amen hallelujah look what
[25:56] these other words of these other
[25:58] brothers would do all these brothers
[26:00] that are falling all these preachers
[26:01] that are falling away in sin look what
[26:03] their word it's eating like a
[26:04] canker because they rejected the true
[26:07] word of God Amen now remember you know
[26:09] this church the word of God can never go
[26:11] stale right but see their messages stay
[26:14] when they preach tongues as AB holy
[26:16] ghost first that's wrong and plus that's
[26:19] the different word for a different day
[26:22] right tongues was never the evidence of
[26:24] the Holy Ghost but they did speak in
[26:26] tongues the day of Pentecost but see
[26:27] they on a false Doctrine like that
[26:29] because they rejected the furthering of
[26:31] the word the further restoration of the
[26:33] word of God everybody knows Martin
[26:35] Luther started restoring the church well
[26:37] that means it's got to keep being
[26:39] restored praise God how can they deny a
[26:40] restoration they'd have to deny Martin
[26:42] Luther but we don't deny Martin Luther
[26:44] we accept Martin Luther's justification
[26:46] but then we add Wesley sanctification
[26:48] and then we add the gifts of the Holy
[26:49] Ghost and now we add rapturing Faith
[26:51] hallelujah amen and the finished mystery
[26:54] of God amen amen that brother R brought
[26:56] us by the grace of God Amen
[27:00] Hallelujah so let's feed on every word
[27:03] of God so we can Fly Above All these

[27:09] overcome the things of the world just
[27:10] Feast on the word of God you'll fly
[27:12] you'll have all the strength to fly
[27:13] above
[27:14] it as an ego praise God Amen that's
[27:18] exactly
[27:19] right brother ramam said brother if
[27:22] there's one thing that I have to do
[27:23] Jesus Christ died in Vain by Grace I'm
[27:26] saved and not by my self but by the will
[27:29] of God and by the goodness and mercy of
[27:32] God Amen see look how he humbled himself
[27:35] he's not saying well I'm Sav because I'm
[27:36] the seventh angel right I'm saved
[27:38] because I I'm the I'm a son of man no if
[27:42] I have to do anything then Jesus died in
[27:44] vain in other words Jesus Paid It all
[27:46] all to him I owe s and left the Crimson
[27:48] Stain and Jesus washed my stains white
[27:51] as
[27:52] snow amen all do is repent believe amen
[27:55] amen all I had to do is accept the
[27:58] sacrifice and recognize I'm a sinner I
[28:00] need a savior and bring that sacrifice
[28:02] and accept that Sacrifice by God's grace
[28:04] I already say the sacrifice was brought
[28:06] for me amen I just had to come and
[28:08] accept the sacrifice
[28:10] Hallelujah and few there be that find it
[28:12] Hallelujah brother says in God hiding
[28:15] himself in Simplicity Albuquerque 63 say
[28:18] aren't you afraid of failing brother R
[28:20] said I'm always a failure oh I'm always
[28:23] a failure see he was he wasn't calling
[28:25] himself the Lord Jesus Christ but he
[28:27] never does
[28:28] amen because I don't speak my words I
[28:31] speak his that's the reason they're
[28:32] always right speaking of prophecies and
[28:34] discernment prayer lines he said I'm
[28:37] always a failure but when when I'm under
[28:39] the anointing I always speak what God
[28:41] says that's why it's right amen
[28:44] hallelujah that's why when he told
[28:46] sister uh Florence Humes I met her in
[28:49] 2009 or 10 before she passed in 2015 but
[28:52] that's why brother said you got
[28:54] tuberculosis go weigh yourself the next
[28:56] two Mondays and you'll gain a pound each
[28:58] Monday and then you'll know you're going
[29:00] to be healed he said I condemn Satan in
[29:03] Jesus Christ's name amen and she did
[29:05] that she went wait herself the next
[29:06] Monday gain one pound next Monday she
[29:08] had five more kids after that and has
[29:09] all all these great grandchildren how
[29:11] could brother R know that because he's
[29:13] the prophet of God God showed him what
[29:15] was going to happen and God gave her
[29:16] instructions on what to do and it came
[29:18] to pass amen amen I met her it's on tap
[29:22] no how can you deny that praise
[29:24] God see brother I would fail if it was
[29:27] my own idea but that wasn't my own idea
[29:29] that was God's idea hallelujah praise
[29:32] God Amen just like God like just like
[29:35] God's told Brother
[29:36] R he says those denominations will never
[29:39] break up and come back to the word he
[29:41] said thus sayith the Lord they'll never
[29:43] break up and come back to the word he
[29:45] said thus sayith the Lord they'll go in
[29:47] with the Antichrist and take the mark of
[29:49] the beast thus sayith the Lord amen and
[29:52] all these denominations keep falling
[29:54] deeper and deeper into sin continual deg
[29:58] de radation and Corruption into sin
[30:00] somebody tell me that's not right that's
[30:02] right because it was spoken from God's
[30:03] mind brother said it and God's word
[30:06] cannot fail Hallelujah that's right show
[30:09] me a denomination that broke up and came
[30:10] back to this word the Lord Jesus Christ
[30:13] and one person the godhead and the Seven
[30:15] Seals and the Seven Church AES show me
[30:17] one denomination they have it they can't
[30:19] because they're Daughters of the mother
[30:21] Hallelujah that's right the only way
[30:24] they could is break up and no longer be
[30:25] denomination then they be free like us
[30:28] flying around here eating on on the body
[30:29] word of the son of man brother the way
[30:31] we come down we Roost we eat all that
[30:33] good food and we go fly out the rest of
[30:35] the week well we come back Wednesday for
[30:36] another feet and two you know Hallelujah
[30:39] that's what we do we fly above the
[30:40] things of the world for a couple days
[30:42] come back down and feast on some fresh
[30:44] meat hallelujah amen it's God giving you
[30:47] his word so his word can never fail in
[30:50] your life
[30:51] Hallelujah so you can be an overcomer in
[30:53] this hour
[30:55] Amen brother Ram is praying he prays to
[30:57] God for mercy and then he says Satan I'm
[30:59] against you because you're an enemy of
[31:01] the Lord You're an enemy of his word and
[31:04] I charge thee by Jesus Christ the son of
[31:06] God as a mortal being look he doesn't
[31:08] say I'm the Lord Jesus
[31:09] Christ knowing that I have no power
[31:12] within myself I said I haven't power to
[31:15] stop you
[31:17] Satan he says but I do have the
[31:20] authority of God's word as a servant
[31:22] that's right he never says I'm the Lord
[31:24] Jesus Christ that's right to preach it
[31:26] and Duty bound to that Authority he said
[31:28] neither does a policeman have the power
[31:30] to stop a car but he's got the authority
[31:33] chch remember you don't have power but
[31:35] you have authority Hallelujah you have
[31:38] the name of Jesus Christ that's why that
[31:40] song says breathe that holy name in
[31:43] prayer and the demons will move back
[31:45] Hallelujah resist Satan and he will flee
[31:48] that's right it's because of your
[31:50] Authority not because of your power
[31:52] that's
[31:53] right is that right
[31:55] amen oh it's beautiful
[31:58] this is the humility of our prophet and
[32:01] I put on that video today I've never
[32:02] seen him exalt
[32:04] himself Moses did we can admit that
[32:07] Moses did he said why won bu you rebels
[32:10] why always got to get water for you and
[32:12] he smoked the Rock God said because you
[32:14] exalted yourself you won't go to the
[32:16] promised land yet amen but about 1500
[32:19] years later he got there hallelujah amen
[32:22] he got there by Vision by theophany
[32:24] hallelujah look how rich and mercy God
[32:26] Is To His prophets
[32:28] amen Moses had a lot of weight on his
[32:31] shoulders they had a lot of pressure

[32:34] tough times but God eventually brought
[32:36] him to the promised
[32:38] land oh glory amen I love
[32:42] it here's what brother says about
[32:44] denomination I might as to read this
[32:46] from the indictment brother Ram said
[32:48] today men walk ignorantly see they're
[32:50] ignorant of Acts 238 they're just
[32:52] ignorant of it they're ignorant of
[32:54] Hebrews 1:3 where Jesus is the express
[32:57] image of his person yeah the exact
[33:00] reproduction of his person not a second
[33:02] person he's the image of the person
[33:04] there's only one person in the godhead
[33:06] amen they're ignorant of these things
[33:09] they're ignorant like I told
[33:10] lady online uh they're ignorant of
[33:14] Genesis 3:15 God said God said uh I'll
[33:18] put hatred between you and the woman
[33:20] between thy seed The Serpent and her
[33:23] seed they're ignorant of that that God's
[33:25] the one who sted the serpent seed
[33:27] serpent Offspring that's what serpent
[33:29] seed seed is Offspring serpent Offspring
[33:32] right and as I I showed you on Sunday
[33:34] Adam called Eve mother of all living
[33:37] even before Genesis

[33:41] mom right she was already mou people are
[33:44] ignorant of these things yeah those just

[33:49] your own understanding no it's right
[33:50] there in black and white amen hallelujah
[33:53] praise God Amen we're not the ignorant

[34:03] the truth they think it's some kind of a
[34:05] ISM don't they yeah look what look what
[34:09] brother says they don't dig down deep
[34:12] enough to get into the spirit of
[34:15] Revelation see they don't pray enough
[34:17] they don't read their Bibles enough they
[34:19] don't get in God's presence enough they
[34:22] would complain sister Z if I preach a
[34:23] two-hour sermon and you'll say Amen the
[34:25] whole time amen they complain and say
[34:29] why is this preacher going so long I got
[34:31] to get to my brunch or I got to get to

[34:44] hallelujah because why we're under the
[34:47] spirit of Revelation praise God God's
[34:49] unveiling something that's what
[34:51] Revelation means unveiling God's
[34:52] unveiling something to us while the
[34:54] preacher's preaching and we get lost we
[34:56] get caught up in Heavenly places we get
[34:58] caught up in the spirit of Revelation so
[34:59] it seems like time just stand still oh
[35:02] God help us again that fear Hallelujah
[35:05] so time can just stand still and then
[35:07] God give us Grace to sleep in the next
[35:09] day and get some
[35:12] rest brother man said they don't pray
[35:15] enough they don't call upon God enough
[35:19] these
[35:20] denominations right that reject the word
[35:21] of God I'm talking Independence too any
[35:24] independent that uh ties up with the
[35:26] Roman Catholic Church on that let me say
[35:28] this did you see Trump Cho Trump chose
[35:30] his VP guess what he's a Catholic he
[35:33] just turned to a Catholic in
[35:35] 2016 guess how many of the Supreme Court
[35:37] Justices are Catholic six out of
[35:40] nine there's a lot of people going
[35:42] Catholic y isn't that what the Bible
[35:44] says though all the children got to go
[35:46] back to the mother is that something now
[35:49] I don't know if Trump's going to win or
[35:50] not who knows what they got lined up
[35:52] after uh the debacco from last week and
[35:54] the wickedness of last week who knows
[35:55] what they got uh in the mix but church
[35:58] we can pray hallelujah amen we can pray
[36:00] we don't want to see anybody hurt we
[36:01] don't want to see anybody uh threatened
[36:04] and violence toward anybody so we have
[36:06] to pray by God's grace maybe we'll do
[36:08] that at the end here but notice that
[36:10] another Catholic pick and that that that
[36:13] that pick he used to be Evangelical okay
[36:17] but that didn't s satisfy him that's
[36:19] according to Wikipedia
[36:20] now I didn't do a whole lot of research
[36:22] I just read Wikipedia you know not the
[36:24] most trustworthy Source but it had
[36:28] citations at the
[36:29] bottom so I can get checked if I'm wrong
[36:32] I I'll accept rection but see being a
[36:35] part of a weak evangelical church and
[36:37] then converting to Catholic say oh oh
[36:39] this is it and brother guess who his
[36:42] Saint was that he wanted to uh be
[36:44] conformed to St Augustine of Hippo isn't
[36:47] that that ought to ring a bell if you
[36:48] listen to Seven Seals
[36:51] yeah what did Augustine a hippo do
[36:54] brother man told us and I even put it in
[36:55] the book it's in history he's the one
[36:57] that said it's okay to kill people if
[37:00] they won't convert to Catholicism he was
[37:02] the one that gave them permission to
[37:04] start killing people Protestants if they
[37:06] wouldn't convert right right because he
[37:09] said it's better to bring them into the
[37:11] kingdom by death than to have them be
[37:14] lost that's a lie right and that's the
[37:17] saint that this man chose to model after
[37:20] so I I don't know if they're ignorant of
[37:22] it I don't know I'm just letting you
[37:23] know it's another Catholic
[37:25] Choice all right H now go to Proverbs
[37:28] 2:3 how I do it on time okay I'm at 34
[37:32] minutes okay pretty
[37:34] good Proverbs chap 2:3 now this just for
[37:37] us church and this is what like we said
[37:40] this is probably what brother Simon's
[37:41] doing right now I'm I'm not going to put
[37:42] the rest of the details on the YouTube
[37:44] but Proverbs 2:3 yay if Thou criest
[37:47] after knowledge you got to cry you can't

[38:00] marriage requirements I cried I laid on
[38:02] my face and asked God and then God gave
[38:04] me that Revelation and not one preacher
[38:07] ever been able to come to try to correct
[38:08] me on that not one

[38:13] cried and prayed about it say God open

[39:21] God's word more than my necessary
[39:23] food so in other words that means he was
[39:25] seeking God rather than eating he was
[39:28] fasting is that right

[40:10] scriptures I got to dig a little bit

[40:23] The Messengers they despise The
[40:25] Messengers they misuse the prophets
[40:28] because they don't get they don't
[40:30] understand this is God's compassion that
[40:31] a prophet would point us back to the
[40:33] Bible amen they want to have women
[40:35] preachers right they want to have women
[40:37] in sexy clothes they want to watch
[40:39] filthy dirty movies that's what they
[40:41] want and I said it before but they're
[40:43] lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of
[40:45] God if you love God then you then you
[40:48] love listening to a sermon more than you
[40:50] white I'm sorry before more than you
[40:52] like watching Netflix I'm just going to
[40:53] say that Hallelujah right if you love
[40:56] God you'd rather read your Bible then

[41:11] stayed up all night watching movies
[41:13] shame on you that you don't love God
[41:14] enough amen you love the pleasures of
[41:17] this world more than you love the word
[41:19] of God
[41:21] hallelujah don't tell me you love God
[41:23] when you don't act like it you got to
[41:25] act like it you gotta you gotta you got
[41:27] to crucify the lust of the flesh amen

[41:32] given to us except what's common to man
[41:34] amen we've all been tempted to watch the
[41:36] wrong things or say the wrong things or
[41:38] do the wrong things and each time we got
[41:40] to crucify the lust of the flesh we have
[41:42] to cast out anything that exalts itself
[41:44] against the word of God we must let the
[41:46] Holy Spirit transform our minds
[41:48] Hallelujah am we must be washed in the
[41:51] waters of the word
[41:53] hallelujah that's where you'll find God

[42:06] go to the avoid babblings I'm not I'm
[42:08] probably not going to get to that so see
[42:09] the first mistake they make they missed
[42:11] the context brother is never saying I'm
[42:13] the Lord Jesus Christ it's the spirit of
[42:16] Elijah is the holy spirit which is the
[42:18] spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ anybody
[42:21] can see
[42:23] that see brother he told us he said did
[42:26] you know this in birth brother said he's
[42:28] talking about he's talking about U Jacob
[42:31] and Esau how how they were I'm sorry no
[42:33] it was Isaac and ishmail he's talking
[42:36] about Isaac and ishma how Isaac is the
[42:39] son of the promise and ishma is the son
[42:41] of the flesh brother trying to explain
[42:43] how that even applies today we must
[42:45] believe the promise of the word not
[42:47] denominational uh
[42:49] ishmael's and brother stop brother
[42:51] William you've heard this and he said my
[42:54] he said uh he said I wish there were
[42:56] some men he said that these men are
[42:58] going to come and make more sense of
[43:00] this and bring this to life remember
[43:03] that quote brother says in the birth
[43:05] pains he said I wish I had the education
[43:07] to do it he said but God is going to
[43:09] send men that can bring this word to
[43:12] life Hallelujah in other words but was
[43:13] doing his best with his Kentucky English
[43:15] and everything like that but God knew
[43:17] there' be time there'd be another
[43:19] generation Glory we're at 59 years of
[43:21] preachers making more sense of this in
[43:23] other words for us it's more clear than
[43:25] it's ever been Hallelujah right amen
[43:28] thank God for the computers we can
[43:29] search and find more information more
[43:31] scriptures more quotes and just line it

[43:35] ever been for any age hallelujah amen
[43:38] it's more clear hallelujah
[43:41] amen like they say I can't unsee the
[43:43] serpent seat I can't unsee there's one
[43:45] God I can't unsee the Lord Jesus Christ

[43:50] says amen I can't unsee there's only
[43:52] male preachers in the Bible I can't
[43:54] unsee that Hallelujah where there's
[43:56] seven Church where the Bible said

[44:00] ages of the future Ephesians well if
[44:02] there's past ages and and future ages
[44:04] there must always be ages hallelujah
[44:06] amen we're in ages right now that's
[44:08] right I can't unsee the Bible I can't
[44:10] unsee a revelation that God has revealed
[44:13] to me Hallelujah I'm glad it's that way
[44:15] too that's what Jesus said when you get
[44:17] a revelation from the Father the Gates
[44:19] of Hell cannot Prevail against us

[44:25] trying to do hell is trying to prevail

[46:32] world began Hallelujah you see God's
[46:35] purpose is for you to live a holy
[46:37] calling amen let's go to Ephesians 1 I
[46:40] know there's another one
[46:42] on
[46:48] purpose yeah Ephesians 1 verse 9
[46:57] having made known to us the mystery of
[46:58] his will see the will what God once done
[47:01] that includes all the teachings of Paul
[47:02] right all the New Testament all the will
[47:04] of God the Ten Commandments all the all
[47:06] the things God brings into the new T the
[47:08] New Covenant as
[47:10] well according to his good pleasure
[47:13] which he has purpose in himself so the
[47:15] mystery of God's will is purpose in
[47:17] himself so your purpose was in God and
[47:21] then God made it known to you it's a
[47:22] holy purpose amen that in the
[47:25] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[47:27] might gather together in one all things
[47:29] in Christ where's that going to happen
[47:31] that's going to happen at the white
[47:32] Throne judgment he's going to gather
[47:34] everything to Christ am Church said
[47:37] sinner Saint whatever it is they're all
[47:39] being gathered together to one person to
[47:42] Jesus
[47:43] Christ both which are in heaven which
[47:45] are on earth even in him in whom also we
[47:47] have obtained an inheritance being
[47:49] predestined according to the purpose of
[47:51] him who worketh all things after the
[47:54] counsel of his own will here it is
[47:56] church verse 12 that we should be to the
[47:57] praise of his glory who first trusted in
[48:00] Christ what's my purpose on this life to
[48:03] praise God to be a testimony for God's
[48:06] glory amen and you can't be a testimony
[48:08] for God's praise and glory without
[48:09] obeying his word
[48:11] hallelujah without living a holy life
[48:13] amen amen what's my purpose on life to
[48:16] be holy Amen to live to the praise of
[48:19] God's glory amen so people can look at
[48:21] me and they can praise God I had another
[48:23] this is the second person that told me
[48:24] this he just told me last night you
[48:26] don't he's not the message but he said
[48:28] the first time I met you I I talked to
[48:30] my wife afterwards and he said is that
[48:31] Jesse guy for
[48:34] real yes you what I told my wife I said
[48:38] yes the soul of me now the Flesh of me
[48:40] is a really awful guy he's my worst
[48:42] enemy I call him
[48:44] bully tell you know what I'm talking
[48:47] about the flesh is my worst enemy but
[48:50] see around him you I remember first
[48:52] meeting him I was just trying to testify
[48:53] just trying to be humble just trying to
[48:55] be a real Christian you just live a reg
[48:56] a Christian Life you know when you meet
[48:58] somebody new you're really trying to
[48:59] show them the love of Christ right and I
[49:01] love that that the very first time he he
[49:03] meets me he's like can this is this guy
[49:05] real yes the Bible said you're like a
[49:08] city on a hill that cannot be hidden
[49:10] praise God that's your light so shine
[49:12] before men that they might see your good
[49:14] works and be to the praise of God's
[49:16] glory amen Ephesians 1:12 Hallelujah
[49:20] that's
[49:21] right that's right look at verse 13 you
[49:23] and I are 13 in whom ye also trusted
[49:26] after that you heard the word of Truth
[49:27] aren't you glad you heard the word of
[49:28] the
[49:29] message the gospel of your salvation in
[49:31] whom also that see after you believed
[49:34] you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of
[49:37] promis Amen there's a seal right the
[49:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that's
[49:42] who he's talking to Paul's talking to
[49:43] people that were filled with the Holy
[49:45] Ghost those Ephesians those mature
[49:47] Ephesians Hallelujah they got the Holy
[49:49] Ghost they're they're set aside for
[49:51] God's holy purpose to the praise of the
[49:53] glory of Jesus Christ amen amen
[49:59] all right now you got
[50:00] that I just thought that was fitting I
[50:02] thought that just came to me I didn't
[50:04] didn't write that down but I just
[50:05] thought i' say
[50:08] that now the second reason brother R was
[50:11] not exalting himself because prophets
[50:13] can reference the scriptures that they
[50:14] fulfill brother was referencing Amos 3:7
[50:17] Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 that's not wrong
[50:21] John did that John the Baptist in John
[50:23] 1:23 he said I am the voice of one
[50:26] crying in the ERS make straight the way
[50:28] of the Lord as said the prophet Isaiah
[50:31] people criticize some of these people
[50:32] that leave the message they criticize
[50:33] brother he talked too much about Malachi
[50:35] 4:5 and 6 and Luke 17:30 what's he
[50:38] trying to do he's being like John the
[50:39] Baptist he said I know my place in the
[50:41] word of God I know why God sent me I
[50:44] want you to receive it if you receive
[50:46] that you'll see so much more of the word
[50:48] of God
[50:49] hallelujah open your heart to the word
[50:51] of God hallelujah
[50:57] and here's the final point this is the
[50:58] the fourth point because remember the
[51:00] other point was that uh other point was
[51:03] that uh brother R always humbled himself
[51:05] I never saw brother exalt himself the
[51:08] one time he did it in the seals he
[51:10] apologized right
[51:11] away remember was in the seals he said
[51:14] uh he was talking about I think the
[51:15] godhead of serpent seed he said I could
[51:17] make if I if I could sit down with that
[51:20] guy I could make his head swim so fast
[51:22] he wouldn't even know what hit him and
[51:24] the people start laughing ha and the
[51:25] brother oh no the Holy Spirit wasn't
[51:27] pleased with that because he he said I
[51:30] put myself in there I could make his
[51:33] head
[51:35] swim brother said I had nothing to do
[51:37] with it he said it would have to be God
[51:40] right and then he even rewards it and
[51:42] says it in a much nicer
[51:44] way Hallelujah let me see if I can find
[51:46] that
[51:48] word that way you got it
[52:01] I don't know if it'll come up let's see
[52:03] Joy so patient with me I like to be able
[52:05] to find these things oh yeah here it is
[52:07] yep Glory it's questions answers on the
[52:09] seals uh this is the morning before he
[52:11] preach the seventh seal so Sunday
[52:14] morning he said you know it shows that
[52:16] people without the
[52:18] baptism of a minister has no business to
[52:20] be in the Pulpit that's right now look
[52:22] what brother brother says I could take
[52:24] that person now by the help of God and
[52:26] hide them in such a knot and make their
[52:28] head
[52:29] swim now brother says oh now I don't
[52:31] mean now that don't sound right forgive
[52:33] me I didn't mean that Lord I felt him
[52:36] check me on that so be careful when we
[52:39] talk
[52:40] about uh putting people in their place
[52:44] be careful you don't exalt yourself like
[52:46] you're going to do it look what brother
[52:48] says I fell and check me on that se so I
[52:50] didn't mean to say it that way I'm sorry
[52:52] he and now here's a nice way he says it
[52:54] I believe that the Holy Spirit could
[52:56] reveal to that person some secret he
[52:59] said that sounds better that's right
[53:02] amen which sounds better I would make
[53:04] his head swim so fast or I believe the
[53:08] Holy Spirit could reveal some secret to
[53:09] that person see the difference in one
[53:13] he's putting himself into it oh I could
[53:15] do this I could make you all I could
[53:16] make your head swim that would glorify
[53:18] me he said but I believe the Holy Spirit
[53:21] could reveal revealing is better than
[53:23] your head spinning right what would you
[53:24] rather have your head spinning after
[53:25] this service or God revealed something
[53:27] to you you'd rather have God give you
[53:30] Revelation see how see how he was so
[53:32] sensitive to the Holy Spirit now he
[53:34] wasn't perfect we're not ex I'm not
[53:35] exalted him I'm just saying he was a
[53:37] mature Christian we you ought to be
[53:38] sensitive I want to be sensitive to the
[53:40] Holy Spirit praise God I want to grow in
[53:42] such a way where I can be sensitive like
[53:44] that if I make a mistake behind the
[53:45] pulpit I'll say Lord God forgive me I
[53:46] want to say it like this
[53:51] amen and one time I'll just share this
[53:53] you know Sister Zur texted me out I
[53:55] didn't plan to share the sister but I
[53:56] hope it's okay by God's grace she had
[53:58] texted me last year and said brother
[54:00] Jess you know I said something that very
[54:01] kind she said it very kind she said uh I
[54:04] hope you're not being vexed by people on
[54:06] the internet you remember that remember
[54:07] she told that I was like you're right
[54:10] sister in my mind I thought you know you
[54:12] you can sense that I'm vexed by
[54:15] people I thought that was really good
[54:17] that was really sensitive there sister
[54:19] and so since then it's been many months
[54:21] I've been trying not to show the
[54:22] vexation against certain
[54:24] individuals right I just been trying to
[54:27] just say broadly you know broadly you
[54:28] got people that attacking brother Bram
[54:30] people that worship brother Bram I'm
[54:32] trying to stay right down the middle of
[54:33] the road amen amen that's right we have
[54:36] to rebuke sin Jesus rebuked it Jesus got
[54:38] out the Rope sometimes and you probably
[54:40] heard me tonight probably sound like I
[54:41] was breaking out some ropes a little bit
[54:43] you know by God chist some digital ropes
[54:46] over the internet you know not here
[54:48] because you all love the Lord and you're
[54:49] in one Accord and you love the Lord
[54:51] Jesus Christ but even the Savior I told
[54:54] that to the brothers down there in
[54:55] Junction City even the Savior said he
[54:58] looked at them and he was angered at
[54:59] them because of the hardness of their
[55:02] hearts sometimes anger is Justified when
[55:06] people are so hard-hearted that's right
[55:09] but you've got to trust God if you're
[55:10] being humble God will lead you to that
[55:11] at the right time amen and if not you
[55:14] got to know this too God will check you
[55:16] when you're wrong and you've got to be
[55:18] humble enough today and say oh I'm sorry
[55:20] I got upset it' sound better if I said
[55:22] this right and you can bring back that
[55:25] real sweetness of the Holy Spirit
[55:28] oh hallelujah praise God brother said
[55:31] it's just like tuning an instrument I'm
[55:33] not a musician so I I I can understand
[55:36] this a little bit right they got to
[55:37] brother amen's got to turn the dials on
[55:40] the on the uh the guitar you to make it
[55:43] sound Just Right Said serving God is
[55:46] just like tuning an instrument when you
[55:48] do something wrong you can tell it as a
[55:50] Christian now what about all these
[55:52] people that went like we talked about it
[55:54] they split churches and they don't even
[55:55] know they're doing wrong they are so out
[55:57] of tune with the Holy Ghost they don't
[55:58] even they they have no fellowship with
[56:00] the Holy Ghost we just talked about
[56:01] they're actually having fellowship with
[56:02] demons if they spit it for a bad reason
[56:04] I'm talking about ever understand that
[56:07] they're so out of their their guitar are
[56:09] Out Of Tune they don't even know it's
[56:10] out they're they're their their their
[56:13] senses are D they've lost the ability to
[56:16] hear if it's in tune or
[56:17] not that's what the Bible says if you
[56:19] keep sinning you're you're U you've lost
[56:22] you gone past the feeling of feeling the
[56:24] sensitivity of the Holy Spirit praise
[56:26] God
[56:27] you gone past
[56:32] feeling he said I said something wrong
[56:34] he didn't like that he said see that was
[56:38] putting me in there see I ain't in the
[56:40] picture at all God help us to have that
[56:44] idea next time we talk to somebody Lord
[56:46] I'm really not in this conversation you
[56:47] just be in this conversation
[56:49] right I'm not in the picture at all
[56:51] because I'm going to make a mistake I'm
[56:52] going to exalt myself I'm going to
[56:54] pridefully try to do something
[56:55] pridefully you know
[56:57] yeah what a sensitivity to the Holy
[57:00] Spirit God didn't like
[57:02] that I don't even want to be myself or
[57:05] nothing it's him let him do the work he
[57:08] does the sounding the trumpets IM mute
[57:10] the voice behind it the one that gives
[57:13] the sound that's right I'm trying to
[57:16] close I'm at 54 minutes here it's
[57:18] already 8:30
[57:21] okay you've been a good audience as
[57:23] always I just like to say that that's
[57:24] kind of like my refresher phrase and try
[57:26] to bring this down to the
[57:27] close now here's the last thing the
[57:29] fourth
[57:30] reason people misunderstand brother
[57:32] brand after context this one is kind of
[57:34] related to context but they fail to see
[57:37] brother random emphasizes his Humanity
[57:39] numerous times in the same sermon in
[57:41] other words throughout the whole sermon
[57:42] he's not saying oh I'm the Lord Jesus
[57:44] Christ I'm the Elijah I'm the Lord Jesus
[57:48] Christ he's not saying that in paragraph
[57:51] 97 he said I'm getting to be an old man
[57:54] and I know my time ain't too long that
[57:55] doesn't sound like somebody who's
[57:57] exalting themsel as
[57:58] God he said if Jesus carries I could
[58:01] stay a little while but I know that
[58:03] someday this heart's going to make its
[58:05] last beat and listen I'm entering into a
[58:08] great dark chamber there called
[58:11] Death right he's not exalting himself in
[58:14] this
[58:17] sermon but when that comes I don't want
[58:20] anything to have to look back for to try
[58:22] to repent for look at this
[58:27] I want when I come to that time to be
[58:28] clean and pure by the grace of
[58:32] God I want to wrap myself in the Robes
[58:36] of his
[58:37] [Music]
[58:38] righteousness Jesus he's not exalting
[58:41] himself he's humbling himself and church
[58:44] he died in less than a month don't you
[58:47] know God gave him some kind of Clues I
[58:49] mean there's all these kind of clues in
[58:50] his last few sermons like he's talking
[58:51] about yeah even in his last sermon he
[58:54] said this may be my last
[58:57] sermon yes and Leadership too he said
[59:00] leadership too that was his second to
[59:01] last his last full sermon was leadership
[59:04] he said this might be my last sermon so
[59:06] let me say
[59:09] this he was a man who knew God was going
[59:12] to he knew he was crossing
[59:15] over he says when I enter there into
[59:17] that dark chamber Called Death think
[59:19] about
[59:20] that this one thing I want in my mind
[59:24] that I know him in the power of his
[59:27] resurrection and when he calls I'll come
[59:30] out from among the dead and live with
[59:33] him forever amen he's not saying I'm him
[59:38] he's saying I'm I'm trusting I have his
[59:40] righteousness on by his grace and I
[59:42] hoping that he calls me Hallelujah I'll
[59:45] live with him forever I'm not him I want
[59:47] to live with him forever praise God why
[59:50] don't they bring up this quote because
[59:51] they don't want you to know that
[59:53] quote they want you to believe the
[59:54] slander yeah they want you to believe
[59:56] the lie we're not going to believe lies

[1:00:01] truthful Spirit Hallelujah I got the
[1:00:03] Holy Spirit hallelujah
