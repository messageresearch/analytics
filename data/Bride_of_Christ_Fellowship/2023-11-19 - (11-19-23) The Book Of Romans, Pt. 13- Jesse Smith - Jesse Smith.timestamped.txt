[5:02] God had a Revival couple weeks ago but

[5:30] amen Romans 5:18 I'd like to pick up
[5:32] there by the grace of the
[5:40] Lord Romans
[5:44] 5:18 we'll just read that one
[5:48] verse I'll close the service with this
[5:50] thought of the power of one so I'm kind
[5:53] of like a subtopic The Power of One
[5:57] Romans 518 let's read that together on
[5:58] three 1 two three therefore as by the
[6:02] offense of one judgment Came Upon all
[6:06] men to
[6:07] condemnation even so by the
[6:09] righteousness of one the free gift came
[6:13] upon all men unto justification of life
[6:17] amen may God has blessing to his work
[6:19] may be seise
[6:24] God so I studying yesterday and just
[6:26] felt you know inspired to get back to
[6:28] this uh series here by the grace of the
[6:32] Lord been reminded that I've gone
[6:34] through Galatians Ephesians Philippians
[6:36] Colossians and I thought well if I don't
[6:38] get back to this I don't know when I
[6:39] ever will by God's grace and then I
[6:41] thought over the years how many
[6:42] different battles or how many different
[6:45] uh trials have we over have you maybe
[6:47] you but definitely I know for me how
[6:49] many trials or how many answers to
[6:50] questions have I had just by preaching
[6:52] through every verse in these books I was
[6:54] thinking about when your dad was healed
[6:56] the first time there that was through
[6:57] the book of Philippians how Colossians
[7:00] has been such a help you know with uh
[7:02] forgiveness of sins and the blood of
[7:03] Jesus Christ and the godhead I was
[7:06] thinking of all the different
[7:07] testimonies and I just thought well I
[7:09] better get back to this here by God's
[7:11] grace and I just want to end with the
[7:12] power of one uh by the end here so I
[7:15] have some uh quotes here to show by the
[7:18] grace of
[7:20] God again we're thankful for all the
[7:22] efforts today we're thankful for all the
[7:24] saints be in the house of the Lord thank
[7:25] you while I was out for everybody who
[7:26] played their part I especially thank
[7:28] brother amen for doing his
[7:30] song leader and all the uh people back
[7:32] there you know she's been computer
[7:34] workers back there but everybody all the
[7:36] saints come into the house of God
[7:37] supporting both Services by the grace of
[7:40] God well the Simon sent me a text and he
[7:42] said uh he said I just love the people
[7:45] he said you got a special group of
[7:46] people I said that's that's right I'm
[7:48] very thankful God gave us a God gave us
[7:51] a bunch of gems here by God's grace I
[7:53] like to call it the cream of the crop
[7:55] you know not in Pride but uh uh just
[7:58] it's God's election yeah God's love is
[8:00] elective love brother Simon even
[8:01] mentioned that God's love is elective
[8:03] and then I sent him a message and he
[8:04] said even a quote I sent him helped him
[8:06] out where I I he said he never seen it
[8:09] before when I shared it with him that
[8:10] how the the refilling only comes in the
[8:13] mind he sent me a message this week
[8:15] saying thank you brother I never saw
[8:17] that before brother Jesse to you sent
[8:19] that message there so I like to see how
[8:22] iron sharpens iron don't you Simon
[8:25] always bring something i' never seen
[8:26] before like the hills and Valley sermon
[8:28] so many different messages he's preached
[8:30] that have been so wonderful and then I
[8:33] like to see how we can be help to one
[8:34] another by God's grace so I want to look
[8:36] at again I just going to briefly uh
[8:38] review here just for a few minutes here
[8:41] we'll kind of see how this serving goes
[8:43] I was telling brother Austin and I've
[8:44] told the church you know numerous times
[8:46] I don't have to preach an hour and a
[8:47] half you know if we want to spend more
[8:49] time praying at the end we can
[8:50] definitely do that but I was texting
[8:51] about that this week with brother Austin
[8:53] if anyone has certain requests or
[8:55] desires I can definitely preach less I
[8:58] don't really have to go and a half I
[9:00] just found it strange last week I
[9:01] preached in Junction City it was exactly
[9:02] an hour and a half I said I told those
[9:05] people I said we only got one service
[9:06] I'm not even looking at that clock and
[9:08] they all kind of laughed but then when I
[9:09] closed I look down oh it's been an hour
[9:11] and a half so just I guess you just get
[9:12] in a pattern you know get into maybe a I
[9:16] guess maybe I get tired after 90 minutes
[9:18] or something like that so but remember
[9:20] let's look at Scofield's outline of
[9:22] Romans you know we're on this third part
[9:23] now we looked at the introduction the
[9:25] whole world is guilty before God uh
[9:27] justification by faith is
[9:29] is the solution I'm going to fix that
[9:31] right now I keep forgetting to fix that
[9:33] is the
[9:34] solution Hallelujah um for your guilt
[9:39] for my guilt justification is the
[9:41] solution he declares us righteous
[9:43] through US sacrifice Hallelujah and now
[9:47] we're looking at the crucifixion with
[9:49] Christ we're going to look at that today
[9:51] maybe by God's grace and the Believers
[9:53] walk in the Holy Spirit this goes up to
[9:56] uh from chapter 512 all the way up to 83
[9:59] this is a longer section and I just
[10:00] think it's supernatural I preached a lot
[10:02] on Romans 8 these last last year and a
[10:05] half with dancing and just the freedom
[10:07] over uh sin and and remembering what the
[10:10] spirit of God has done for us it's done
[10:12] amazing things praise God and then we
[10:14] see the final result of the Gospel
[10:16] blessing God's promises to Israel and
[10:18] tonight in the evening service I'll
[10:19] teach the children about Israel which
[10:21] I'm just going to kind of use that as a
[10:22] chance to go through the the order of
[10:24] end time events I've had numerous
[10:26] questions about it I was asked last week
[10:28] there are Junctions City and I just it
[10:30] was just impressed upon me wow there's
[10:32] way more events than I thought there's
[10:33] so many more verses especially from the
[10:35] Old Testament on Israel and then I
[10:38] thought you know while U you know I hear
[10:39] different message preachers I like to
[10:41] pull on their gifts as well I heard
[10:42] numerous you know message preachers say
[10:44] the Rapture is so close now now now
[10:47] remember two years ago it was just days
[10:48] away or seconds away so now it's you
[10:51] know in their thoughts it's milliseconds
[10:53] away um we'll just see you know I just
[10:56] differ with them I feel like God would
[10:58] let us know if it's that close uh and
[11:00] they say well they have no scripture
[11:02] saying there's time left well there
[11:03] actually is scripture there's definitely
[11:05] scripture that needs to be fulfilled we
[11:07] know talked about Jesus talked about
[11:08] with the birth pains and the bride being
[11:10] forced to stop preaching that still
[11:13] needs to be fulfilled yes other
[11:15] scriptures about Israel that's what I
[11:16] want to kind of get into tonight uh by
[11:18] God's grace more scripture for Israel so
[11:21] uh we just want to be ready for the
[11:23] coming of the Lord and I believe God is
[11:25] making us ready Hallelujah uh but you
[11:27] know with all these different preachers
[11:28] saying things I just I kind of like to
[11:30] it makes me ask questions you know makes
[11:32] me pray to God helps me to talk to God
[11:34] more Lord is this really is this really
[11:36] the time as you've heard me said I was
[11:38] even praying it yesterday I think even
[11:39] this morning Lord just show me if the
[11:41] Rapture is going to be in my lifetime or
[11:42] not I've still asked God for that I
[11:44] still pray said God I'd like to know if
[11:46] it's my time or not I would just like to
[11:48] know how many believe God can give us
[11:49] our hearts Des brother Ram thought it
[11:51] would come in his day of course it
[11:53] didn't um but I just keep asking God
[11:55] those things because I just want to be
[11:57] ready I don't want to I don't want to
[11:58] fear I don't I don't want to put fear
[12:00] upon the people and I myself I don't
[12:01] want to be overcome by fear I want to be
[12:03] led by faith Hallelujah yes I want to
[12:06] walk in the spirit I don't want to walk
[12:07] in a spirit of fear I want to walk in
[12:09] the Holy Spirit Hallelujah I want to
[12:11] redeem the time because the days are
[12:13] evil now remember this this book of
[12:15] Romans had a major impact on the last
[12:19] three Church age Messengers you know
[12:21] some historians say uh Martin Luther
[12:23] probably outside of Christ has had the
[12:25] greatest impact upon the church now I
[12:27] would argue with that I would probably
[12:28] say St Paul
[12:29] but maybe if you're talking about people
[12:31] that didn't write the Bible you know
[12:33] because Luther uh his his Reformation it
[12:37] opened the doors to everyone else in
[12:39] other words the Bible says uh you know
[12:40] we're all building upon the foundation
[12:42] that Christ laid Christ is the
[12:43] foundation you know Paul Peter James all
[12:46] the New Testament writers but here you
[12:48] know towards the top Luther lays down
[12:50] his ministry and now you know it just
[12:53] makes sense nobody's Ministry can have
[12:55] an impact without the the foundation of
[12:57] Luther right right but that's based on
[12:59] the foundation of Paul praise God yes
[13:02] but it's just amazing to see you know
[13:04] the impact that the book of Romans had
[13:05] on Luther Wesley and Brandon Hallelujah
[13:08] brother Brandon being our church age
[13:10] messenger I'm skipping down to the blue
[13:11] Park uh this is a historical thing uh
[13:14] when Martin Luther came to a fresh
[13:16] understanding of the book of Romans he
[13:17] said when I understood this text the
[13:19] doors of paradise swung open and I
[13:22] walked through hallelujah amen it was
[13:24] the book of Romans that awakened Luther
[13:25] to the doctrine of justification by
[13:27] faith alone and for persuaded him that
[13:29] this was the article upon which the
[13:31] church stands or Falls praise God how
[13:33] many feel like you're living in
[13:35] Paradise Hallelujah even in Satan's Eden
[13:38] even in leoda you feel like you're
[13:40] walking in Paradise how can you feel
[13:41] that way because you're seated in
[13:43] Heavenly places The Book of Romans
[13:46] unlocked that to Luther he says now I'm
[13:48] living in a spiritual Paradise here but
[13:51] where do we go after we die we go to the
[13:53] the real Paradise this paradise changed
[13:56] locations it used to be in the heart of
[13:57] the Earth but now hallelujah it's in the
[13:59] third heaven hallelujah amen it's up
[14:01] there uh near the Throne of God
[14:03] hallelujah but Martin Luther said I
[14:05] walked in a spiritual Paradise after God
[14:08] gave me the revelation of justification
[14:10] through the book of Romans John Wesley
[14:13] got saved reading and hearing a sermon
[14:16] on the book of
[14:17] Romans so what can I expect as we preach
[14:20] the book of Romans I know it's already
[14:21] done great things for brother Austin we
[14:22] preached on Abraham remember that
[14:23] brother you were texting me about that
[14:25] remember that during a sermon a powerful
[14:28] uh verion came to John Wesley he s he
[14:31] felt he said he felt his heart strangely
[14:33] warmed oh God give us a heartwarming
[14:35] service today amen let this service not
[14:38] be in vain hallelujah amen like
[14:40] Wednesday night was a heartwarming
[14:41] service Hallelujah every service last
[14:44] Sunday should have B every service
[14:45] should be a heartwarming service amen
[14:47] amen our hearts are drawn closer to
[14:50] Christ and that sermon was from the book
[14:53] of Romans now remember brother Adam said
[14:55] every time he got a little depressed he
[14:56] turned turned to Romans chapter 4
[14:59] and he said uh he he said he staggered
[15:02] not Abraham stagger not the promise of
[15:04] God hallelujah every time I feel a
[15:06] little down you know what I do I put on
[15:08] a little music Haven was telling me I
[15:10] started in my in my office I started
[15:12] just playing music as soon as I get home
[15:13] I plug my iPad in and just start playing
[15:15] music Haven said yesterday she said I
[15:17] really like that atmosphere Daddy I said
[15:19] that's why I'm doing that that that that
[15:21] Spirit I'm sorry that Spirit of worship
[15:23] brings me out of my trials amen
[15:25] refreshes me Hallelujah I'll say every
[15:28] time I go to feeling a little awful what
[15:30] do I do I crawl up here to the altar I
[15:31] crawl into my prayer closet and cry my
[15:34] way to a closer walk with God hallelujah
[15:37] praise God Amen that's right brother
[15:40] said uh the Ephesians and the Romans
[15:43] Paul wrote These great deep messages
[15:47] that are the Deep things of God how many
[15:49] like the Deep things of God remember
[15:51] just to have skin milk uh it's it's
[15:54] wrong to remain in skin milk everybody
[15:56] has to start with skin milk but if we
[15:58] forget we're saved if we forget what
[15:59] baptism is if we forget uh you know just
[16:02] the simple things of God then we have we
[16:05] have fallen short as Christians we
[16:07] backed and it's time to get the
[16:09] discernment back in our lives amen we
[16:11] we've let some something sinful in our
[16:13] lives right we haven't discerned good
[16:15] and evil in our daily life and we we
[16:17] back it into an immature or childlike
[16:20] condition but we should be mature able
[16:22] to teach others also praise God like my
[16:26] barber uh texted me uh him yesterday but
[16:29] he texted me last week he said what are
[16:30] you making of all this Israel thing he
[16:32] said is this the end of and I sent him
[16:33] you know this five minute message and he
[16:35] said wow he said you really are a
[16:36] preacher I said I said well I'm glad you
[16:39] can see the Deep things in my life now
[16:41] see if I wasn't deep I'm talking about
[16:43] mature if I wasn't mature I wouldn't be
[16:44] able to answer his question right I'd
[16:46] say well I don't know either I don't
[16:48] want to be those kind of preacher I want
[16:49] to be a mature don't you want to be a
[16:51] mature Christian Jesus said be therefore
[16:53] mature hallelujah amen amen even as your
[16:56] father which is in heaven is mature how
[16:58] that clap is that too loud lady okay you
[17:00] feeling okay today all right praise God
[17:02] I didn't want to clap too
[17:03] loud but I like this Paul could write
[17:06] people deep things because they live
[17:08] deep amen the Corinthians couldn't
[17:11] handle the deeper things of God so we
[17:12] should be able to handle deep servants
[17:14] praise God Amen like the law of
[17:16] restoration Hallelujah like the hither
[17:18] to God yes amen like praising his name
[17:21] in the dead Hallelujah I forget cam
[17:23] Saturday night service I forget the
[17:25] title of that one but those are Revival
[17:27] messages praise God we should be able to
[17:29] receive the Deep things of God
[17:31] hallelujah am and we do by the grace of
[17:33] the Lord we're not
[17:35] babies and then brother am said I was
[17:37] reading in Romans 4 again where Abraham
[17:40] staggered not at the promise of God and
[17:43] he said he said we know Abraham many
[17:45] times got
[17:47] flustrated but God didn't mention his
[17:50] frustrations
[17:51] amen hallelujah he never mentioned them
[17:55] at all
[17:57] Hallelujah in heaven God is not going to
[17:59] mention any of your shortcomings
[18:01] Hallelujah he's not going to remember
[18:03] any of your mental backslidings
[18:04] Hallelujah not even mention praise God
[18:08] Amen all he's going to remember is that
[18:10] you didn't give up you staggered down
[18:12] you kept fighting the good fight of
[18:14] Faith you press on until you receive the
[18:16] crown of
[18:18] righteousness that's in the Book of
[18:20] Romans
[18:21] amen you said that's the way I hope mine
[18:24] will be written up too see there's a
[18:25] there's a Divine story about your life
[18:27] brother they amen Hallelujah brother
[18:29] Austin brother Jose Malachi there is a
[18:32] Divine commentary about your life in
[18:34] heaven it's called your book hallelujah
[18:37] amen and all your mistakes will not be
[18:40] in there just what you tried to do for
[18:43] God that's what be recorded in your book
[18:45] Hallelujah that's what Abraham's book
[18:48] had and you're the child of Abraham
[18:50] hallelujah amen now remember just
[18:53] briefly remember uh Claudius had
[18:55] banished all the Jews around 49 ad and
[18:58] and then they came back uh around 54 ad
[19:02] and so when the the Jews came back they
[19:04] found the church in Rome in a in a in a
[19:07] strange condition there's a lot of
[19:09] misunderstanding so Paul wrote this
[19:11] letter around 57 to 60 before he arrived
[19:15] and he was trying to get them
[19:16] straightened out uh the purpose again he
[19:18] was trying to unite Jews and Gentiles in
[19:21] the gospel Hallelujah I'm going to skip
[19:24] past that because I want to read what
[19:26] scoffield said I like what Scofield
[19:27] scoffield said the theme of Romans I've
[19:29] never I haven't preached this yet is the
[19:31] gospel of God the very widest possible
[19:33] designation of the whole body of
[19:35] redemption Truth for it is he with whom
[19:38] is no respect of persons who is not the
[19:41] god of the Jews only but the god of
[19:43] Gentiles also amen think about that God
[19:45] loves you as much as anybody else praise
[19:48] God that's encouraging us but if we're a
[19:50] small church God loves us just as much
[19:52] as the big church amen and God will not
[19:55] respect them more because they're bigger
[19:57] nor will he respect us less cuz we're
[19:58] smaller God loves us all praise God his
[20:02] Spirit can move through all of us praise
[20:04] God that's right amen there is no
[20:06] respector a person with God all the
[20:09] world is guilty but Redemption is
[20:11] revealed as wide as the need upon the
[20:14] condition alone of
[20:16] Faith Romans also embodies the fullest
[20:19] way the doctrines of Grace in relation
[20:21] to Salvation in the three remarkable
[20:23] chapters we haven't got to those yet and
[20:25] the great promises to Israel are
[20:27] reconciled with the promises according
[20:29] to the Gentiles and the Fulfillment of
[20:32] the former shown to await the completion
[20:34] of the church and coming of the
[20:36] deliverer out of Zion in Romans 11 I
[20:39] love this the key phrase is the
[20:41] righteousness of God hallelujah it's not
[20:43] the righteous of brother Jesse or the
[20:45] righteousness of sister ACAA it's not
[20:47] that's not the key phrase the key phrase
[20:50] is God shares his righteousness with us
[20:53] God Amen it takes out all the legalism
[20:56] takes out all the fear takes out all the
[20:58] doubt takes out all the misunderstanding
[21:01] because we live by the righteousness of
[21:03] God
[21:04] Alone Now I I told you it was a short
[21:07] intro it was there now therefore as by
[21:09] the offense of one judgment Came Upon
[21:11] all men to condemnation even so by the
[21:14] righteousness of one the free gift came
[21:17] upon all men unto justification of life
[21:19] let's all say free gift again ready free

[22:00] keeping a list amen thank God it's a
[22:02] gracious list amen thank God there's
[22:04] forgiveness of sins in that list but
[22:06] it's a free gift so salvation is just
[22:08] freely given all you got to do brother R
[22:10] said is receive it he said just apply it
[22:13] and brother Ram gave the example like
[22:15] marriage like I we married amen and ha
[22:17] and Austin and Lena after I married you
[22:19] you didn't stay at the altar you went
[22:22] home and became one I'm just trying to
[22:26] that's what brother said that's the
[22:27] illustration brother R uses for the
[22:29] gospel you just don't hear and it STS at
[22:31] church you take it home with you praise
[22:33] God you become one with it hallelujah
[22:36] amen you just don't hear and say well I
[22:38] believe I believe I believe who is my
[22:40] wife amen could have said that all day
[22:41] all day well you got to take her home
[22:45] right Austin could have said that all
[22:46] day I believe she's my wife I believe I
[22:48] believe that's that's fine but take her
[22:50] home amen yeah right become one be live
[22:54] live your life together enjoy life walk
[22:56] daily in unity that's what the the Holy
[22:58] Spirit wants us to do walk in unity with
[23:00] the Holy Spirit Hallelujah walk in the
[23:03] spirit every day take it home with you
[23:04] take it to work
[23:06] hallelujah
[23:08] amen first by one man's Disobedience
[23:11] many were made Sinners so by The
[23:13] Obedience of one shall many be made
[23:15] righteous so we get we get this compared
[23:18] contrast one man sin Adam caused all men
[23:22] to be judged and condemned one man calls
[23:24] it yeah thanks Adam well if it would
[23:27] have been you you would have done the
[23:28] same thing right would have been me I
[23:30] would have done the same thing but yet
[23:32] the contrast to that is one man's
[23:34] righteousness gifted all believers to be
[23:36] justified it was a free
[23:38] gift right so sin uh sin was sin was uh
[23:44] the Bible said the wages of sin is death
[23:45] we'll get to that here so sin was forced
[23:49] upon us but now we're given a free gift
[23:52] and it's not forced upon us we have to
[23:54] accept it
[23:55] Hallelujah one man's disobedience caused
[23:58] many Sinners but one man's obedience
[24:01] caused many righteous amen ah I think of
[24:03] that that picture there in Revelation 7
[24:06] they asked the Holy Ghost asked John
[24:08] John who is this multitude he said thou
[24:10] knowest Lord and he said they're waving
[24:13] they're waving palms and everyone is
[24:15] robed in wi he and the voice said these
[24:17] are them that came and washed their
[24:19] woves right in the blood of Jesus Christ
[24:22] amen he said they're from every tribe
[24:24] every Kindred Every Nation every tongue
[24:26] who is this multitude this is The Blood
[24:28] Bought Blood Washed multitude Hallelujah
[24:32] all these were righteous because of one
[24:34] man and it wasn't you or me wasn't
[24:36] brother Brandon wasn't Martin Luther it
[24:37] was Christ hallelujah amen all this
[24:40] multitude that cannot be numbered
[24:42] they're all there we all get to go to
[24:44] heaven because of one man Christ Jesus
[24:47] Oh Glory remember that picture I showed
[24:51] you Adam brought sin in the world Jesus
[24:53] gives us victory over sin Adam uh many
[24:56] died because of Adam many live because
[24:58] of the grace of Christ Adam's sin causes
[25:01] condemnation jesus' death results in
[25:04] justification his Disobedience brings
[25:07] sin to many but Christ's obedience
[25:09] brings righteousness to many Adam's sin
[25:12] Reigns in death but Jesus's Grace Reigns
[25:15] to bring eternal life amen I love am
[25:18] plain scripture moreover the law uh
[25:21] entered that the offense might abound
[25:24] but where sin abounded Grace did much
[25:26] more abound so the law purposely
[25:29] magnified our offenses so that Grace
[25:31] might magnify Jesus's righteousness so
[25:34] God gave us 613 laws in the Old
[25:36] Testament on purpose to prove to us
[25:38] without a shadow of doubt you can't keep
[25:40] all of them Hallelujah and then they
[25:43] they have a daily sacrifice they had a
[25:45] morning evening sacrifice that was just
[25:47] for the temple just for the priest and
[25:49] then Believers could come in and worship
[25:51] there there was death all the time
[25:52] Bloodshed all the time Hallelujah I mean
[25:55] there was constant Bloodshed it's it's
[25:57] always a bloody mess but there's all
[25:59] this death and think of it Solomon I
[26:01] think he sacrificed 10,000 Rams 10,000
[26:04] Rams think about this the amount of
[26:07] sacrifice that was put uh was put up
[26:10] before God by these Old Testament
[26:11] worshippers but the Bible said God did
[26:14] it on purpose to show us how much sin
[26:16] abounded but it also showed us the power
[26:19] of Grace Grace would much more abound
[26:22] than sin praise God
[26:25] wow think about it look at the world how
[26:27] many can see sin covering the world Amen
[26:30] sin is just flooding the world it's
[26:32] flooding uh the Internet it's flooding
[26:34] uh the the the schools the the politics
[26:37] it's flooding everywhere but the Bible
[26:39] said righteousness will abound more than
[26:41] that praise God oh and Jesus comes back
[26:44] amen we'll have righteousness all over
[26:47] the whole world will know Jesus
[26:48] hallelujah amen his righteousness will
[26:51] be Proclaim from every nation Hallelujah
[26:54] he'll rule with the rod of iron praise
[26:56] God if sin abounds this much how much
[26:58] more will righteousness abound
[27:00] Hallelujah that's why said don't miss
[27:02] that Thousand-Year Millennium praise God
[27:05] he said whatever you do make it to there
[27:07] in other words whatever you do be filled
[27:08] with the Holy Ghost he said never go to
[27:10] the white Throne judgment to be judged
[27:11] he said get filled now and don't you
[27:13] miss that great Millennial Reign praise
[27:15] God Amen that's what the Bible says the
[27:19] rest of the Dead live not until the
[27:20] thousand years were finished those that
[27:22] were not the Born Again those that did
[27:24] not make the first resurrection remember
[27:27] the law was the school Master to bring
[27:29] us to Christ that we might be justified
[27:30] by faith and not by our our
[27:32] righteousness and remember I just bring
[27:34] these out again because I love these
[27:36] verses God has forgiven all your
[27:39] trespasses amen he's not holding it
[27:42] against you right there it's forgiven
[27:45] everything he even nailed it to his
[27:47] cross they're taken out of your way so
[27:50] if the devil's trying to put your sins
[27:52] in your way today just just tell the
[27:54] devil you got to take them out of the
[27:55] way because Jesus took them out of out
[27:57] of the way praise God they can't stay
[27:59] there they can't stay in my view he's
[28:02] already taking them out of the way I
[28:04] don't see any sin in front of me praise
[28:06] God I just see Victory
[28:08] Hallelujah I just see Heaven Hallelujah
[28:10] I just see Victory I just see Joy I see
[28:13] eternal life praise God I see Jesus
[28:15] coming
[28:16] hallelujah it's out of your way your
[28:20] sins your past is not in your way
[28:23] Hallelujah your your pasts are behind
[28:25] you remember the scripture I preached it
[28:26] a few months ago God put your sins
[28:28] behind his back remember that one it's
[28:30] been a while it's been a while for me
[28:32] too but that's what he's done it's not
[28:34] in your way now there's consequences and
[28:36] things but your path in other words God
[28:39] allowed that and your path is going to
[28:40] be straight it's a narrow road that
[28:42] leads to eternal life but it's a narrow
[28:44] clear path Hallelujah there there don't
[28:46] have to be obstacles in the way he's
[28:48] taking it out of the way hallelujah amen
[28:51] all right now this was a great verse
[28:53] again let's review this one here we
[28:56] have my little children these things
[28:58] write unto you that he sin not if any
[29:00] man
[29:01] sin that's all of us we have an advocate
[29:05] we have a lawyer or a comforter or
[29:07] intercessor so see we get we beat
[29:10] ourselves up oh how did I sin how did
[29:12] but we got somebody trying to comfort us
[29:14] Jesus is trying to comfort us be
[29:15] encouraged just confess I'm going to
[29:18] plead your case and I've never lost a
[29:21] case let me remind you I never lose a
[29:23] case because my father's on the throne
[29:26] Hallelujah amen I'm the son and I'm
[29:29] family members with the judge
[29:32] amen hallelujah it's all set up so we
[29:35] can be forgiven Hallelujah so we can get
[29:37] a fair trial Hallelujah that's right I
[29:40] got jur Duty next month honey I forgot
[29:41] to tell you sir I'm as tell you now
[29:43] that's on my mind December 13th I got
[29:45] jury duty hopefully they cancel it but
[29:49] if you sin you have a lawyer or
[29:51] intercessor somebody can go to God for
[29:55] you and that's Jesus Christ the
[29:58] righteous next time I go to Junction I
[30:00] think I'm going to preach on the blood
[30:02] of Christ and kind of bring out some of
[30:03] these scriptures because then hopefully
[30:04] that will set them free more free from
[30:06] their legalistic
[30:08] background so if you sin you have an
[30:10] advocate he is the propit which means
[30:13] the
[30:14] appeasing Jesus made appeasing of your
[30:17] sins in other words now you have peace
[30:19] with Goden he's taken your wrath has
[30:22] been taken away and not for ours only
[30:25] but for the sins of the whole world
[30:26] think of that and hereby we do know that
[30:29] we know him if we keep his Commandments
[30:30] there's 8 billion people on the Earth
[30:32] just now just now right how many
[30:35] billions or trillions have there been
[30:36] down Through the Ages and Jesus Paid It
[30:39] All Jesus Paid It all all to him I owe
[30:42] praise God sin and left the Crimson s
[30:45] but he wash it white as
[30:48] s hereby we do know that we know him if
[30:52] we keep acts
[30:53] 238 amen if we keep Malachi four five
[30:57] and six Hallelujah all the scriptures
[31:00] praise God Amen if we keep every
[31:03] scripture that proves you know him
[31:05] hallelujah amen you know people use that
[31:07] quote sometimes and they were
[31:08] criticizing brother BR they said brother
[31:11] you don't know the Bible real well
[31:12] brother R said yeah but I know the
[31:13] author real
[31:15] well right but people use that as an
[31:18] excuse not to study their Bible
[31:20] preachers are supposed to study the
[31:22] Bible Hallelujah brother was just saying
[31:25] he said I don't know all the theology I
[31:27] he said I don't know uh the book well
[31:30] like like you and your theology but I
[31:31] know the author real real well but the
[31:34] Bible says that no Christ is to know
[31:36] life Hallelujah to have life is to know
[31:39] Christ and we know brother R knew the
[31:41] scriptures better than all them
[31:43] Hallelujah he didn't have them all
[31:45] memorized and have all this the history
[31:47] behind it all memorized but he knew the
[31:49] Revelation hallelujah amen the
[31:52] revelation of Jesus Christ the gates of
[31:54] hell can not Prevail against that
[31:56] Hallelujah so brother did know the Bible
[31:58] better than them praise God
[32:00] Amen see you can't know Christ without
[32:02] knowing his Commandments and then
[32:04] keeping them if any man say I know
[32:07] Christ and don't keep his Commandments
[32:08] what the Bible said they're a liar they
[32:10] don't know Christ they don't have the
[32:11] love of God you should be happy you got
[32:13] the love of God in your life such
[32:15] Amazing Grace if you sin you've got a
[32:18] lawyer to get you out of prison amen out
[32:21] of
[32:23] complexes out of
[32:25] discouragement out of dep question you
[32:28] got somebody to get you out of there
[32:29] praise God
[32:30] am just keep his
[32:33] commands
[32:35] glory and I just couldn't you know I
[32:36] studying last night this morning I
[32:38] couldn't I can't skip this I almost
[32:41] every Easter I bring this up brother
[32:43] said Calvary is one of the greatest days
[32:47] three things have meant to us we could
[32:49] take hundreds but he said I've just
[32:50] chosen three vital things we want to
[32:52] look at what Calvary meant to us and
[32:55] look at this he said I pray my seron
[32:57] will condemn every sinner that's present
[33:00] not condemn to hell but just make you
[33:01] feel guilty right you know make every
[33:05] saint go onto his knees that's what I
[33:06] like to see when my sermons put people
[33:09] on their knees and me also praise God
[33:11] don't leave me out amen that make every
[33:13] sick person raise his faith to God and
[33:16] walk away heal like Jose hallelujah amen
[33:20] every sinner saved every backs come back
[33:22] and be ashamed of himself every saint
[33:24] rejoice and take new hold and New Hope
[33:26] am
[33:26] [Music]
[33:28] amen the first thing he says is that the
[33:31] sin question is settled once for all
[33:34] amen amen it's the greatest of all days
[33:37] he said Calvary the sin price was
[33:39] settled s second Satan's power was
[33:42] broken amen and now we want to see what
[33:45] we should do in
[33:46] return He said now the works that I do
[33:49] shall you do also now this is the third
[33:50] thing the sin question is settled you
[33:53] don't have to worry about Sin as far as
[33:55] in heaven you're forgiven Satan's power
[33:58] is broken over your lives second third
[34:00] thing now Christ wants to work through
[34:03] you to spread this grace to others Amen
[34:06] to bring the ministry of Salvation the
[34:08] Bible calls it reconciliation God wants
[34:11] to work through you to do that praise
[34:12] God
[34:15] Amen he says Healing The Sick raising
[34:17] the dead opening the eyes of the blind
[34:19] these Works shall you do also you'll do
[34:22] you'll do these if you believe you shall
[34:24] do works and then a greater than this
[34:25] shall you do for I go to my father
[34:27] a little while in the world won't see me
[34:29] no more yet you'll see me I'll be with
[34:30] you even in you to the end of the world
[34:32] I'll not leave you comfortless I'll pray
[34:34] the father he'll send you another
[34:35] comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom
[34:37] the world cannot receive yet you can
[34:39] receive it so the third thing is the
[34:42] Greater Works was to have power in the
[34:45] church not only to heal the Sick by
[34:47] prayer cast out Devils by prayer but to
[34:50] impart eternal life to Believers so this
[34:53] is one Element now you've heard me say
[34:55] before I don't believe we can do greater
[34:57] miracles than Jesus I don't believe that
[34:59] right there brother R said it I know
[35:01] there's quotes on both sides but I'm
[35:03] saying with that one I like that quote
[35:04] better because who's greater than Jesus
[35:06] no one's greater than Jesus brother one
[35:08] place said greater means more just a
[35:10] number more miracles right but here's an
[35:13] interesting thought too where I could I
[35:15] could say Amen to
[35:16] this once Jesus left the Holy Ghost come
[35:19] and now the church could do Greater
[35:21] Works in other words while Jesus was
[35:23] alive people weren't being filled in
[35:24] their soul but now you can be build in
[35:27] your soul Hallelujah because the blood
[35:29] of Jesus Christ has forgiven and
[35:31] abolished all the sins amen amen so yeah
[35:34] I like that thought that's a good
[35:36] thought in other words greater as far as
[35:38] now the soul can be healed amen now
[35:41] eternal life can come into that Soul
[35:43] Hallelujah because if they get raised
[35:45] from the dead they'll die again right
[35:47] but if they get eternal life in their
[35:48] soul their soul will never die
[35:50] hallelujah
[35:53] amen that's what Calvary mat St
[35:56] Hallelujah amen it was given to the
[35:58] church to impart
[36:01] life he said it stooped it took a stoop
[36:04] to gred men and women and lifted them
[36:06] into a place to be Sons and Daughters of
[36:07] God to heal the sick and impart eternal
[36:09] life by giving the Holy Ghost to
[36:11] obedient Believers men who were once
[36:13] unbelievers be made Believers and impart
[36:15] spiritual eternal life Hallelujah that's
[36:19] the New Testament praise God eternal
[36:21] life can be imparted now next verse that
[36:24] as Sin hath reigned unto death even so
[36:26] Grace Reign through righteousness unto
[36:29] eternal life by Jesus Christ Our Lord so
[36:32] sin reigned for 4,000 years before
[36:34] Christ but now Grace has reigned for the
[36:37] last 2,000 years and will reign for all
[36:41] eternity Grace doesn't stop church after
[36:43] we die amen Grace doesn't stop after
[36:46] this generation Grace will continue
[36:48] Without End Amen in other words we'll be
[36:51] singing Amazing Grace brother amen all
[36:53] throughout eternity Hallelujah that song
[36:56] will never leave us will always Rejoice
[36:58] over God's Amazing Grace Hallelujah his
[37:01] unmar favor just get used to it if you
[37:03] don't like Amazing Grace it's time to
[37:05] like it praise God you're going to like
[37:07] it either now or later might as well
[37:09] like it now now moving to chapter six
[37:12] brother said what shall we say then
[37:13] shall we I'm sorry the Bible says what
[37:15] shall we shall we continue in sin that
[37:17] Grace May abound God
[37:20] forbid God forbid and this is what a lot
[37:23] of churches do they say you're saved you
[37:24] can live however you want this this is
[37:25] the calvinistic idea right Calvin's like
[37:28] if you just said one prayer no matter
[37:29] what you do you're going to be saved
[37:31] well we know that's wrong Jesus said if
[37:33] you don't overcome I'm blotting your
[37:34] name out right even though remember he
[37:37] talking to both Vines he's talking about
[37:38] he's talking to the True Vine and the
[37:40] false Vine in the framework of the
[37:41] church right and he said if you don't
[37:43] overcome in your church age your name
[37:45] spotted out thank God for overcoming
[37:46] power hallelujah thank God thank God
[37:49] we've got overcoming power to overcome
[37:52] Leia today
[37:55] Hallelujah how shall we that are dead to
[37:58] sin how many dead to sin amen it's dead
[38:01] right it's dead live any longer there in
[38:05] how can you live in something if it's
[38:06] dead right right
[38:09] right know you not that so many of us as
[38:12] we're baptized into Jesus Christ we
[38:14] baptized into his death Hallelujah
[38:18] remember church this is our baptism
[38:19] scripture you know we baptized brother
[38:21] Chris last year anybody else last year
[38:23] or was it earlier this year we baptized
[38:24] brother Chris I think it was earlier
[38:26] this year by the way he moved out to
[38:27] Arizona he said did he tell you that
[38:29] brother okay he sent me a text and he
[38:31] said he said with the conditions of the
[38:33] world uh he said moving out to his
[38:35] family in Arizona I said well we'll pray
[38:36] for you maybe he'll come back sometimes
[38:39] God sends people back from Arizona
[38:44] brother God is God is rich in
[38:46] Mercy we just keep trusting the
[38:50] Lord if we're dead to sin how can we
[38:53] live in
[38:54] it know you that that so so many of us
[38:57] as we're baptized into Christ we're
[38:58] baptized in his death so Christians must
[39:01] discontinue a sinful
[39:03] lifestyle like sinning the same sins
[39:06] every single day right we are dead to
[39:09] sin because we were baptized into
[39:12] Jesus's death
[39:15] Hallelujah therefore we are buried with
[39:17] him by baptism into death isn't that
[39:20] interesting I'm buried with him in other
[39:23] words you and I can relate as Christ was
[39:25] put behind the stone
[39:26] so is our old life put behind a
[39:29] stone oh like that song the things I
[39:33] used to do I do them no more amen is
[39:36] that true hallelujah it's been buried
[39:40] and baptism showed that baptism was the
[39:42] sign that I put that sinful life away
[39:45] from
[39:46] me and just as like as Christ was raised
[39:50] up from the dead by the glory of Father
[39:51] even so we also should walk in the
[39:54] newness of life amen in other words
[39:56] always keep your walk new and freshh
[39:58] with God Amen praise God we got to find
[40:01] a way to make it new make it feel like
[40:03] it's fresh again I don't know about you
[40:05] but I feel like that every time I come
[40:07] to church Hallelujah I do I do now I got
[40:10] a battle once I get out those doors but
[40:13] while I'm here I feel fresh and new
[40:15] hallelujah amen I feel new and after
[40:18] those arrival Services I felt really new
[40:19] as well amen went home and more devoted
[40:22] Hallelujah keeping that up by God's
[40:24] grace amen hallelujah it's keeping that
[40:27] life making it feel new again and that's
[40:30] by confessing our sins to our
[40:32] Advocate I like when Simon sings that
[40:34] song I just want to talk to Jesus what's
[40:36] it called I must tell Jesus I love that
[40:38] song now I can't sing it because I don't
[40:40] know it but I love that song church
[40:42] that's all you got to do to get back in
[40:44] the newness of life I must tell Jes just
[40:46] tell Jesus what you've done tell Jesus
[40:48] you just need more
[40:50] grace right he'll plead your case before
[40:53] the
[40:54] father now for if we been planted
[40:57] together in the likeness of his death so
[40:59] if we've died to our past life we shall
[41:02] also be in the likeness of his
[41:05] resurrection Hallelujah so if we've been
[41:08] baptized and and then no doubt we'll be
[41:11] raised like Christ was raised from the
[41:13] dead
[41:14] Hallelujah notice that our old man is
[41:16] crucified with him that the body of sin
[41:19] might be destroyed which is abolished or
[41:22] severed from that henceforth we should
[41:24] not serve sin our old life is
[41:28] crucified right and our our all of our
[41:31] sins all of our past sins are destroyed
[41:34] they're abolished amen they are severed
[41:37] away like there's a circumcision type
[41:40] right severed away cut off no more right
[41:44] and we are not Servants of sin
[41:47] hallelujah praise God we not serve the
[41:49] devil we not serve this flesh body
[41:51] hallelujah amen we'll serve Christ we'll
[41:54] serve his purpose Hallelujah amen amen
[41:58] that's what baptism represented I was
[42:00] buried with him I was crucified him
[42:02] that's why brother R said you were there
[42:04] with him on the cross now really you you
[42:07] weren't right now you might have been in
[42:10] his thoughts right right if all God was
[42:12] in him then surely you know we were
[42:14] chosen in Christ so no doubt all the
[42:16] Believers down Through the Ages remember
[42:18] he died for the joy that was set before
[42:20] him which was seeing his seed according
[42:22] to Isaiah 53 but but physically you and
[42:25] I were in there we were still in the
[42:27] thoughts of God right but this is why
[42:29] brother ad say you you got to make it in
[42:31] your mind we got to we got to picture
[42:33] our minds that just as Christ died I
[42:35] died to my old life just as he raised
[42:38] I've raised a new man as well praise
[42:40] God is this is what the Bible
[42:44] teaches in other words if you've
[42:46] surrendered your life to Jesus Christ
[42:48] it's as if you were buried with him it's
[42:51] as if you were crucified with him praise
[42:54] God and now you're your body of sin
[42:57] think about that all the times I sinned
[42:58] from the time I was what three or four
[42:59] whenever I started sinting all the way
[43:02] up to when I got saved all that has been
[43:04] destroyed all the evidence has been
[43:06] destroyed
[43:07] hallelujah praise God hallelujah right
[43:10] and that was tiped by Mariam and and
[43:13] Moses right dancing after Israel came to
[43:15] the Red Sea there's no more evidence all
[43:17] those task Masters all my history's been
[43:19] erased Hallelujah by the blood of Jesus
[43:22] Christ it's been abolished I was severed
[43:25] in other words I was severed the the
[43:27] water separated but then the water came
[43:29] down and now I'm separated from my
[43:31] Egyptian life I'm separated from my
[43:33] worldly life I'm walking on to canaan's
[43:35] land I'm walking to the place where I
[43:37] possess all the
[43:40] promises where I possess my land not
[43:42] everybody's land but the land God gave
[43:44] to you and I praise God
[43:46] Amen
[43:49] Hallelujah so that old life Saints is
[43:52] destroyed no more records brother bam
[43:55] said you had old book of sin remember he
[43:57] said that he said but then Jesus when
[43:59] you got saved he said Jesus took his
[44:00] blood and wrote pardon and then he threw
[44:02] your old book in the sea of
[44:05] forgetfulness I didn't plan to preach
[44:07] this but I think I forget how many uh
[44:09] miles the the the ocean is deep I think
[44:13] it was almost six miles or something
[44:15] like
[44:16] that and church you know they still
[44:18] can't get down to the bottom without
[44:19] things exploded remember that happened
[44:21] earlier this year they tried to go down
[44:23] and see the Titanic and exploded they
[44:25] still can't get down the bottom of this
[44:26] thing now what does that show that Satan
[44:28] can't get down to the bottom of our sins
[44:30] right he can't bring them up that's
[44:33] right they're buried in the sea of
[44:34] forgiv praise God hallelujah God did it
[44:37] on purpose to show that's how deep
[44:40] nobody can go that deep only God can go
[44:42] that deep and he forgot it Hallelujah
[44:44] that's what it represents I'm forgetting
[44:46] that no one can touch it that's been
[44:48] abolished it's been seed away from you
[44:51] no more records hallelujah
[44:54] amen this is the gopel this is deep
[44:56] preaching
[44:58] Hallelujah Glory remember this the word
[45:01] destroy struck me he that commits sin is
[45:03] of the devil for the devil sins from the
[45:04] beginning for this purpose the Son of
[45:06] God was manifested that he might destroy
[45:09] the works of the devil so see so Jesus
[45:11] manifested your life to loose you from
[45:13] your addictions to loose you from your
[45:16] change to unbind you from whatever was
[45:18] binding you to release you from the
[45:20] power of darkness and now you're under
[45:22] the power of God's light amen that's
[45:25] what it means
[45:26] Satan's Works have been destroyed in my
[45:28] life now I'm loose Now I'm Free Like
[45:32] Jesus told that woman woman th are
[45:34] loosed amen you are free Hallelujah
[45:37] you're not bound to your past you're not
[45:39] bound to those sins anymore you're free
[45:42] can I say bride of Christ you are loose
[45:44] hallelujah amen the Church of Jesus
[45:47] Christ is Loos from the past Jesus
[45:49] destroyed the works of the devil praise
[45:52] God Amen because whosoever is born of
[45:54] God they can't s in their soul his seed
[45:57] remains in him and he cannot sin because
[45:59] he's born of God I cannot one part of me
[46:01] cannot sin hallelujah praise God one
[46:05] part of me can Another Part Of Me can't
[46:07] hallelujah thank God now I thought it
[46:10] was just beautiful brother Ram uh I
[46:12] looked up there's one time in the whole
[46:15] message where brother Ram said uh shall
[46:17] we continue in sin that Grace May abound
[46:20] God forbid it's in
[46:23] 1959 so here he reads Romans 61 through
[46:26] 5 and he's baptizing in his home church
[46:28] and he said I want to take a text about
[46:30] 20 minutes I don't know if it was I
[46:31] don't know if it's was 20 minutes or not
[46:32] it's probably longer than 20 minutes
[46:33] kind like when I said give me 15 more
[46:34] minutes right I preach a half hour his
[46:36] title was identify with Christ now
[46:38] identify means to regard as having
[46:40] strong links with so if you're
[46:43] identified with Christ I've got a strong
[46:44] link to
[46:46] him or it means I'm regarding myself as
[46:49] having the same characteristics as
[46:52] Christ I'm identified with him I'm a
[46:55] associated with him I have a strong link
[46:58] to
[46:59] Jesus now church this was a very uh
[47:03] common theme brother R Used being
[47:04] identified with Christ there's at least
[47:06] 10 sermons with the word identify in it
[47:10] Christ is identified the same in all
[47:12] generations how many think that's
[47:13] important word 10
[47:16] sermons five definite identifications of
[47:18] the Church of the Living God God
[47:21] identifying himself by his
[47:22] characteristics God is identified by his
[47:24] characteristics ident ification identifi
[47:27] identification of Christ in all ages
[47:30] again again identified Masterpiece of
[47:33] God and identified with Christ
[47:35] hallelujah amen brother is trying to
[47:37] make a point you are strongly linked to
[47:40] Jesus amen that's why you walk through
[47:42] the snow brother to get to church when
[47:43] you're younger Hallelujah that's why
[47:45] Austin tried to go to church and they
[47:47] gave him candy remember your testimony
[47:48] brother they gave you candy say a prayer
[47:49] I'll give you some candy that's not
[47:51] that's not the real formula but he had a
[47:52] desire to serve God hallelujah see you
[47:55] want you want a strong link between you
[47:57] and Jesus Hallelujah yes that that means
[48:00] I'm identified with Christ well baptism
[48:03] is what does
[48:04] that brother said people have no
[48:07] satisfaction
[48:09] today he says because they've got a
[48:11] nature God gave them that
[48:13] nature they've got a nature that makes
[48:15] them want to have something to identify
[48:17] themselves with so each and every one of
[48:19] us we want a strong link to something
[48:21] used to be I wanted a link to Michael
[48:22] Jordan or you know the NFL I wanted a
[48:25] link to that I really want to do that
[48:26] but now I don't care about that I want
[48:28] to link to Christ yes I want to be in
[48:31] contact with him now look my says they
[48:35] must have something they like to be like
[48:36] an objective in life they want to be a
[48:38] movie star see they want to be linked to
[48:39] that
[48:40] movie or a cowboy or something like
[48:42] cowboys were famous in those days what's
[48:45] today today is a Marvel Superheroes
[48:47] that's what I want to be linked to
[48:48] Batman or I want to be linked to
[48:50] Superman well I am linked to the
[48:51] original Superman Hallelujah the Lord
[48:54] Jesus Christ amen he's the original
[48:56] Superman Hallelujah the only
[48:59] Superman see everybody wants to be
[49:01] identified with something and we got to
[49:03] be careful not to become identified with
[49:06] anything other than Christ right that's
[49:08] what we got to have our strong link
[49:11] to God made a man to desire to have an
[49:13] example so other words when you're
[49:15] identified with something you you use
[49:17] that as your example to pattern your
[49:19] life after amen that example of Jesus
[49:22] Christ now listen if we be more like him
[49:25] the wouldn't be so many big shots in the
[49:27] world there wouldn't be any hungry
[49:29] children in the world think of that
[49:32] there wouldn't be any Whiskey Drinking
[49:33] gambling and I'm I'm glad to say we
[49:35] don't have any of this in our
[49:37] church is there any big shots in here
[49:39] anybody want to try to take over for me
[49:41] and preach today any want to be a big
[49:42] shot or any big shots well Malachi you
[49:44] move let me play Malachi come on who's
[49:47] trying to be the big shot around here
[49:49] see you're just finding your place and
[49:51] you're being happy in your position in
[49:52] Christ we don't we don't have these
[49:54] problems because we put Christ first
[49:57] he's he's our
[49:59] identification
[50:01] Hallelujah that's what's the matter with
[50:02] the world they got the desire God give
[50:04] them that but they turn it around the
[50:05] wrong way it's time to return back get
[50:08] on the right Road get facing Calvary
[50:10] nature proves it
[50:13] Hallelujah and think about you know I
[50:15] heard brother you know preaching a
[50:16] sermon yesterday I can't remember which
[50:18] one it was now brother said look he said
[50:21] the men are cutting I'm sorry the men
[50:22] are letting their hair grow he said they
[50:24] want to be women he said women are
[50:26] cutting their hair they want to be men
[50:27] and look where we are these 60 years
[50:29] later right that was the seed form of
[50:32] what it is today it's almost like his
[50:34] preaching was for this
[50:36] day you know that was people thought oh
[50:38] there's nothing wrong with the woman
[50:39] cutting her hair now look what she wants
[50:41] to be she wants to be a man right like I
[50:43] saw I was just flipping through some
[50:45] videos and there's this there's this
[50:46] Entertainer she's a woman she calls
[50:48] herself the man that's her nickname is
[50:50] the man she wants to be that's her
[50:52] nickname She's the Man and it starts
[50:55] with this this little thing this little
[50:57] breaking of God's word right leaving
[50:59] your order right it's woman man Christ
[51:02] God like I Shar that with the church
[51:03] last week and they went whoa I never
[51:05] thought about that scripture before
[51:07] because there's an order and we got to
[51:09] stay in our order praise God Amen but
[51:11] they try to exalt themselves to a
[51:13] different position let's stay right
[51:15] where God made us that's where we'll be
[51:17] the happiest that's where we'll be
[51:18] identified with Christ
[51:23] amen he said if only people would look
[51:25] to Christ as their example he said we
[51:27] would we could fire now he means lay off
[51:29] right lay off every police officer out
[51:31] there be in the nation everybody would
[51:33] be meek and
[51:35] humble every would be kind and have
[51:37] brotherly love one for another there
[51:39] would never to be a divorce case ever
[51:41] pled in our country there would never be
[51:43] any sickness we could dismiss hospitals
[51:45] if everybody tried to make Jesus Christ
[51:47] their example we wouldn't have need for
[51:50] nothing else so I like this just this
[51:52] thought of identification this is what
[51:54] he's preaching to people that are going
[51:55] to be
[51:57] baptized he said share in his meekness
[51:59] you also share in his power share in his
[52:01] obedience you also share in his
[52:03] resurrection do as God says do in my
[52:05] heart the greatest thing I could think
[52:07] of is to be like Jesus Christ to be
[52:09] identified with him brother Jose we're
[52:12] reading through that book he got me the
[52:13] generations book and we're probably
[52:15] maybe five or six testimonies in and
[52:17] every person says there's nobody like
[52:19] brother Brandon he was just so humble he
[52:21] was so much like Jesus now some of them
[52:22] worship him but that's a sin uh they got
[52:26] caught up in the deity
[52:27] spirit but in every case they said we
[52:30] just never met such a loving humble
[52:33] person right he'd always make you feel
[52:35] like you're the big guy he always make
[52:38] you feel like you're the special
[52:41] one it's amazing they said they would
[52:44] they would see brother and priest to
[52:45] 10,000 people but then after that he'd
[52:47] go to the Little House of hady Wright
[52:50] and spend time with Hatty Wright and
[52:51] Edith Wright who was in a wheelchair and
[52:54] everybody wanted to shake hands them at
[52:55] the meeting but then he would come down
[52:57] he' go squirrel Hun he has squirrel
[52:58] blood all over his
[53:00] shirt and he would talk with a with a
[53:02] simple humble people the widows the
[53:05] crippled so let's remember no matter
[53:08] what great meetings or no matter what
[53:09] great events we go to let's remember to
[53:11] constantly descend to people of lower
[53:14] estate let's be
[53:17] humble and clearly we can see that
[53:20] brother R wanted to be like Jesus
[53:22] Christ he said that's why I baptize in
[53:24] the name of Jesus Jesus
[53:26] Christ because he's our identification
[53:28] we pack the identification whatsoever
[53:30] you do in word or deed do it all in the
[53:32] name of Jesus Christ giving praise to
[53:34] God for it and we are identified with
[53:36] him in baptism he said tonight we're
[53:38] going to baptize in a few minutes people
[53:40] here in the room that's here to be
[53:41] baptized if there's any desire in your
[53:44] heart that you want to have a great
[53:46] worldly Ambitions repent of them right
[53:48] now tell God you're sorry that you
[53:49] wanted to be some great worldly person
[53:52] say Lord my complete ambition is to be
[53:54] like Christ if only we can say that
[53:57] today come meekly humbly and when you
[54:00] put your hands upon his head he's now
[54:02] referring to the Old Testament tradition
[54:03] of putting the priest putting his hands
[54:05] on the animal
[54:07] Sacrifice by faith confess your sins say
[54:09] Lord I'm sorry I done it then what what
[54:12] will happen if you do that today church
[54:14] God will transfer all your guilt over to
[54:16] him and take his innocence and put it
[54:18] back on you and you stand justified in
[54:22] the presence of God because you believed
[54:23] on Jesus Christ his son What A Plan of
[54:27] Salvation then you'll share in his glory
[54:29] the goodness of God will come in see
[54:31] really really if you just say God I'm
[54:34] sorry and you really mean it something
[54:36] has to happen hallelujah amen all that
[54:38] guilt has to leave if you say I'm sorry
[54:41] the guilt has if you really meant it it
[54:42] has to leave and God's goodness will
[54:44] flow into
[54:45] you you can't help it it has to happen
[54:48] it's that cleaning out of the house if
[54:50] you clean out the house God's spirit is
[54:52] going to fill it up praise Goden Matthew
[54:54] chap 12 remember that the power of his
[54:57] resurrection will make you a new person
[54:59] it'll satisfy every longing you won't
[55:02] long for those worldly things you won't
[55:04] long for that kind of life you long for
[55:05] the life that Christ wants for
[55:08] you all right now back to Romans
[55:11] 6 okay only preach 45 minutes 47
[55:15] 47 for he that is dead is free from sin
[55:18] or Justified from
[55:21] sin so you're free your past is gone
[55:24] you're free from
[55:26] that now if we be dead with Christ we
[55:28] believe that we shall also live with him
[55:31] isn't that something we're dead and
[55:32] alive brother Austin at the same time
[55:35] how does that work M I'm dead and alive
[55:38] at the same
[55:40] time my goodness I'm a dead man but I'm
[55:43] a living man praise God we got to be
[55:46] dead with
[55:48] Christ in other words You' crucified the
[55:50] desires Amen to live a sinful
[55:54] life well if I'm dead with Christ I will
[55:56] live with Christ knowing that Christ
[55:58] being raised from the dead he dies no
[56:00] more amen death ha no more dominion over
[56:04] him praise God for in that he died he
[56:07] died once to sin but in that he lived he
[56:09] liveth unto
[56:11] God likewise reckon well that means
[56:13] count count you also yourselves to be
[56:16] dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God
[56:20] through Jesus Christ Our
[56:23] Lord remember brother gave the
[56:25] illustration the quote was coming to me
[56:28] again he said brother said uh he said
[56:30] you got to picture your life as like
[56:32] your old life is is like a dead body in
[56:34] a casket brother said if that dead body
[56:37] jumps up and says I'm alive he said you
[56:39] got to go push it
[56:41] down right you got to remember no you're
[56:44] dead right right right when your flesh
[56:46] wants something or you want to get angry
[56:48] and tell somebody up or you want to
[56:51] criticize or get depressed or fall into
[56:54] that you you got to push that guy down
[56:56] or that gal down and say no you're dead
[56:59] I'm alive
[57:00] Hallelujah that's what the B that's
[57:02] dying
[57:03] daily count Yourself Dead to sin I'm not
[57:06] alive to this anymore I'm dead to this
[57:09] through Christ my
[57:11] Lord
[57:14] hallelujah and he says let not sin
[57:17] therefore reain in your mortal body that
[57:19] you should obey it in the lust
[57:22] thereof now rain this is getting back we
[57:24] the last time I preached uh Part 12 I
[57:26] ended with this how we're Kings and
[57:28] Priests and God very familiar to us but
[57:30] again it's very familiar to the
[57:32] scripture so we must constantly remind
[57:34] ourselves of this let not sin re in your
[57:38] mortal body that you should obey it in
[57:41] the lust thereof so remember there's a
[57:43] difference between being tempted and
[57:44] actually obeying
[57:46] it temptation is what we have to go
[57:49] through right but we we got to overcome
[57:51] it we got to we got to uh we got to
[57:53] crucify it Hallelujah and then not let
[57:56] it rain in our body we can't let sin
[57:59] have exercise kingly power over us we
[58:03] can't let sin have the highest influence
[58:06] on our day we can't let our sins ruin
[58:09] our day for Christ right we can't let
[58:12] sin ruin our weak the church said
[58:15] Hallelujah can't let it happen yeah we
[58:17] all struggle we all have different
[58:18] battles every now and then but let's see
[58:20] more victories in who who wants more
[58:22] victories in our lives amen amen this is
[58:24] good a reminder if you're dead with him
[58:27] you're raised with him as well amen and
[58:29] you've got power over that sin and he
[58:33] says do not obey it don't let it be the
[58:35] most influence in your life praise
[58:39] God so we got to ask ourselves what's
[58:41] our greatest
[58:43] influence what are we in other words
[58:45] each day what are we most excited about
[58:47] what are we most looking forward to the
[58:48] Bible said don't make any provision for
[58:50] the flesh right don't plan out any times
[58:54] where we can sin or or try to do that or
[58:57] or try to get the pleasures of life or
[58:58] anything like that don't plan for that
[59:01] the Bible said Reign Over it ah
[59:04] Hallelujah the Bible said you exercise
[59:07] control over it praise God amen amen
[59:09] don't plan it out the Bible says don't
[59:12] let it re in your mortal body that you
[59:15] should obey the lust
[59:17] thereof neither yield yourselves members
[59:20] as instruments unto God I thought it was
[59:21] interesting Paul gives two don'ts
[59:24] usually we like to hear what what to do
[59:26] usually we like positive things like
[59:28] like at school they have this new
[59:30] positive behavior system they started
[59:32] few years ago and we're not we're not
[59:33] allowed to say uh don't kick we can't
[59:37] say don't we have to say uh keep your
[59:40] hands to yourself please now I still
[59:43] sometimes say don't because they say
[59:45] there's no power in negative words well
[59:47] there is
[59:48] sometimes Thou shalt not Jesus said
[59:51] right right the Bible says Thou shalt
[59:52] notal amen th shalt not kill but it's
[59:56] just it's just man's psychology right
[59:58] they're trying to control sin but you
[1:00:00] can't control outside of repentance
[1:00:02] right right but Paul says don't let sin
[1:00:07] re in your body in other words let
[1:00:08] righteousness re in your life and then
[1:00:11] he says don't yield to sin in other
[1:00:12] words yield to God so I'll give you the
[1:00:14] negative and I give you so I give you
[1:00:15] the negative over here don't I give you
[1:00:17] the positive over here amen whichever
[1:00:19] one helps you use that
[1:00:20] one don't let sin rain don't yield to
[1:00:23] sin or let righteousness Reign yield to
[1:00:26] God today praise
[1:00:28] Goden yield yourselves to God as those
[1:00:31] that are alive from the dead and your
[1:00:33] members as instruments of righteousness
[1:00:35] unto God
[1:00:38] hallelujah so see these two instructions
[1:00:40] are sticking out to us we can't we can't
[1:00:43] let sin control Our Lives can't let sin
[1:00:46] ruin our days ruin our weeks ruin our
[1:00:48] months and we can't yield to it we have
[1:00:51] to yield to
[1:00:52] God now getting back to that day on
[1:00:54] coward this was such a beautiful section
[1:00:56] of
[1:00:58] quot Jesus broke the powers of Satan he
[1:01:01] opened the prison doors of Hell to every
[1:01:03] man that was shut up in this earth in
[1:01:04] the prisons fearing that he had died
[1:01:06] what death would be able to do on him
[1:01:09] Calvary he opened those cell doors that
[1:01:11] every captive Go free you don't have to
[1:01:13] be no longer be torn down by sin you
[1:01:16] don't have to no longer use your members
[1:01:18] to sin drinking smoking gambling telling
[1:01:19] lies you can be honest just and upright
[1:01:22] and Satan can do nothing about it
[1:01:25] amen because Jesus I always use this
[1:01:26] door CU it's close door Jesus opened the
[1:01:29] door and you can walk out of your
[1:01:31] problems you can walk out of your sin
[1:01:33] you can walk out of he can't Satan can't
[1:01:36] hold you out well Jesse's not getting
[1:01:37] out of there or Mai is not getting out
[1:01:38] of there he can't hold you in Jesus
[1:01:40] opened the door praise God hallelujah
[1:01:44] this is how brother Ram explains the
[1:01:46] power of Calvary amen amen amen it
[1:01:49] settles the sin question right all the
[1:01:51] sins are forgiven and now Satan has no
[1:01:54] power on us because we've got the word
[1:01:56] of
[1:01:57] God
[1:01:59] hallelujah that's why the Bible said he
[1:02:01] that the son is set free is what free
[1:02:03] indeed truly free amen you don't we
[1:02:06] don't have to be slaves we can be
[1:02:07] Overcomers amen if you like deep
[1:02:09] preaching praise God Amen Hallelujah you
[1:02:13] got a hold of the lifeline he says it's
[1:02:15] anchored in the Rock of
[1:02:17] Ages Lifeline Hallelujah holding on to
[1:02:20] Christ nothing can shake you from the
[1:02:22] lifeline no winds can shake you from it
[1:02:24] no nothing not even death itself can
[1:02:26] separate us from the love of God that's
[1:02:28] in Christ Jesus amen that's the story
[1:02:30] brother random gave remember brother RAM
[1:02:33] for his anniversary he went hunting on
[1:02:35] his anniversary now how many sisters
[1:02:37] would like that for your husband's
[1:02:38] taking on an anniversary trip we'll go
[1:02:40] off and we'll go get away in the woods
[1:02:42] but I'm going leave you here so I can go
[1:02:44] hunt and be gone all morning into the
[1:02:46] afternoon how many now sister don't have
[1:02:47] to raise your hands something tells me I
[1:02:50] don't think my wife would like that very
[1:02:51] much if I said if I said I like to go
[1:02:53] hunting on an anniversary
[1:02:56] well that's what brother did and while
[1:02:57] he's out there a snowstorm came in I'm
[1:02:59] just going to paraphrase this
[1:03:01] story and he thought well I'm a Woodsman
[1:03:03] I know my way back and he said I walked
[1:03:05] in a circle he said the Indian Death
[1:03:06] March remember
[1:03:08] that and he kept doing it kept doing it
[1:03:11] until he finally broke down in
[1:03:12] Repentance and he said God I'm not a he
[1:03:15] said I'm not a God I I don't know the
[1:03:18] woods I can't make it home on my own and
[1:03:20] he said that's when he lifted up his
[1:03:21] hands to praise God and then his hand
[1:03:23] hit the electric line and that electric
[1:03:26] line would guide him back to his cabin
[1:03:28] with his wife he was going to die and
[1:03:31] that's what he's saying here Satan can
[1:03:33] do nothing because you got a hold of the
[1:03:35] lifeline you might be like you're lost
[1:03:38] some days you might go through weeks of
[1:03:40] difficult time but as soon as you get a
[1:03:42] hold of the lifeline Satan has no more
[1:03:44] power youve got to way back Hallelujah
[1:03:48] am and that's what he was telling God
[1:03:50] God now my wife's going to got no
[1:03:52] electric or she's got no food there the
[1:03:54] baby's going to die I I got to have you
[1:03:56] Lord I'm reaching out to you I'm
[1:03:58] praising you and then his hand hit the
[1:03:59] line and he's got a Lifeline he said now
[1:04:02] my wife won't freeze to death now I I
[1:04:04] won't freeze to death but it took
[1:04:06] repentance he had to Humble himself and
[1:04:08] say I I'm not the big guy I'm not the
[1:04:10] boss I I I need God's grace I need God's
[1:04:13] mercy every hour praise God amen
[1:04:16] amen not even death itself can separate
[1:04:19] us from the love of God where's that
[1:04:21] from Romans chapter
[1:04:22] 8 Hallelujah
[1:04:25] my beautiful that's what Calvary meant
[1:04:29] men that were in bondage were set free
[1:04:32] men that were once under fear of death
[1:04:33] can no longer fear death a man who Longs
[1:04:35] for a city whose Builder maker is God he
[1:04:38] can step on the highway and set his face
[1:04:40] toward Heaven because he's free amen
[1:04:43] that's what brother says in the sermon
[1:04:44] brother said Abraham wandered around
[1:04:46] looking for a city but now brother says
[1:04:48] because of Christ now we know where
[1:04:49] we're walking we're spiritually walking
[1:04:52] to that New Jerusalem amen
[1:04:56] he didn't know where he was walking
[1:04:58] right remember he died not receiving the
[1:05:00] promise he died with only of few
[1:05:02] descendants but God said your
[1:05:04] descendants will be like the stars in
[1:05:06] heaven he died not seeing the end of the
[1:05:08] promise but God always keeps his promis
[1:05:11] amen God if God has promised us anything
[1:05:14] we shall have it praise God we may not
[1:05:17] see it on this side but God will
[1:05:18] definitely give it to us cuz God is not
[1:05:20] a liar like a man amen he keeps his word
[1:05:23] hallelujah but he asked us to be patient
[1:05:25] in the midst of Trials
[1:05:26] Hallelujah he asked us to trust his way
[1:05:29] not our
[1:05:32] way you don't need to wonder no more for
[1:05:35] there's a way of knowing whether you're
[1:05:37] right or not Hallelujah God gives us
[1:05:39] life our sins are gone that day at
[1:05:41] Calvary paid the price when we see all
[1:05:44] that no wonder the poem wrote mid
[1:05:45] rendering rocks and darkening Skies My
[1:05:48] Savior bowed his head and died the
[1:05:50] opening Veil revealed the way to
[1:05:52] Heaven's Joys and endless
[1:05:55] day prise God
[1:05:58] hallelujah reminds me of Haven hav wrote
[1:06:00] me a poem for my birthday and it was
[1:06:02] such a rhyming poem I'm like how do you
[1:06:03] write that haven you've got a gift of
[1:06:06] God there's something in there that
[1:06:08] writes all these lyrics it's inspiration
[1:06:11] it's the Holy Spirit Abraham don't have
[1:06:14] to wonder no more across the country
[1:06:16] seeking the city The Sinner don't have
[1:06:17] to wonder anymore whether he be saved or
[1:06:19] not the sick man don't have to wonder
[1:06:21] whether he can be healed or not the
[1:06:22] opening Veil on that day of calvary
[1:06:24] revealed the way to the total Victory
[1:06:26] amen God give us the powers of his
[1:06:29] Spirit to live triumphantly over all
[1:06:31] these things ask us to only believe it
[1:06:33] that happened on that day at Calvary
[1:06:37] amen never day was never there was a day
[1:06:39] like it never there will be one like it
[1:06:41] it's not necessary no more the price is
[1:06:43] paid we're redeemed amen there's no way
[1:06:47] you have to wonder about there's no more
[1:06:48] guessing about it he took it all out of
[1:06:50] the way what what what he took he took
[1:06:52] what out of the way all the sin
[1:06:54] questions am I going to go to hell has
[1:06:56] God forgiv me that's all taken away the
[1:06:59] powers of Satan can Satan have power
[1:07:00] over me no Jesus broke the
[1:07:03] power all the questions settled praise
[1:07:05] God no more guessing the veil pull back
[1:07:09] the curtain and we're set on a highway
[1:07:11] not to wonder anymore but to believe and
[1:07:13] just walk right on we walk right into
[1:07:16] God's very presence amen because the
[1:07:18] veil has been
[1:07:20] torn almost done here for sin shall not
[1:07:23] have dominion over you for you are not
[1:07:25] under the law but under
[1:07:28] grace What then shall we sin because
[1:07:30] we're not under the law but under grace
[1:07:32] God forbid so twice in this chapter Paul
[1:07:33] says God forbid God forbid that we
[1:07:36] should keep sinning so Grace gets
[1:07:38] greater and then he said uh God forbid
[1:07:41] we should uh sin because we're not under
[1:07:43] law we're under grace now God forbid in
[1:07:46] other words God wants us to appreciate
[1:07:48] what the cross did for us amen God wants
[1:07:51] us to appreciate the fact that he wrote
[1:07:52] pardon with his blood upon our old list
[1:07:55] of sins and through it in the sea of
[1:07:57] forgetfulness like that song says i'm
[1:07:59] want to live like I'm
[1:08:00] forgiven I'm going to live like my sins
[1:08:03] are forgiven how's that song say he's
[1:08:06] worthy my song remember that song from
[1:08:07] Brother Phil I'm GNA live like I'm
[1:08:10] forgiven I can't ever remember the exact
[1:08:12] words anybody remember the exact I'm
[1:08:14] going to live like my king is risen I
[1:08:15] know that hard but that's how I want to
[1:08:17] live we want to live like we're forgiven
[1:08:19] people amen hallelujah I'm under grace
[1:08:22] I'm not under the law
[1:08:25] and he says don't you know don't you
[1:08:27] know that whom you use your memb
[1:08:29] servants to obey his servants you are to
[1:08:31] whom you obey whether of sin unto death
[1:08:34] or of un obedience unto righteousness
[1:08:36] see this this would help any church
[1:08:39] member right Jewish virgin or wise
[1:08:41] virgin this so shows you who you're
[1:08:43] serving whoever you yield to on a
[1:08:46] constant basis that's whose God that's
[1:08:48] the god you serve whether Christ or
[1:08:51] Satan but God be thanks so in other
[1:08:54] words God deserves some things for this
[1:08:55] right here church that you were the
[1:08:57] Servants of sin but now you've obeyed
[1:08:59] from the heart the form of doctrine that
[1:09:02] was delivered to you so you ought to
[1:09:04] give some God some thanks if you've
[1:09:06] obeyed the doctrine amen
[1:09:09] hallelujah amen maybe we can do that
[1:09:11] since it's Thanksgiving right Hallelujah
[1:09:13] we should do that every day like amen
[1:09:14] saying thank you Lord for Calvary last
[1:09:16] week right there's an hour so I don't
[1:09:18] have to go much longer I don't have
[1:09:21] to being made free from sin you became
[1:09:24] the Servants of righteousness Hallelujah
[1:09:27] so this is what we should be thankful
[1:09:28] for that we've obeyed the word of God
[1:09:31] Christ has set us free our sin debts
[1:09:34] paid for Satan has no more power of us
[1:09:37] and now we can do the works of
[1:09:39] Christ we can do the works of
[1:09:42] Christ I'm going to finish Romans 6 I
[1:09:45] speak after the manner of men because of
[1:09:47] the infirmity of Flesh for as you have
[1:09:49] yielded to set at hand to stand by or
[1:09:51] near your memb servants to unclean and
[1:09:54] to iniquity unto iniquity even so now
[1:09:56] yield your memb servants to
[1:09:57] righteousness unto Holiness now see what
[1:10:00] the word yield means it means to just

[1:12:06] done even so now yield your members so
[1:12:09] stand beside Christ waiting for orders
[1:12:12] unto
[1:12:14] Holiness for when you were the Servants
[1:12:16] of sin you were free from righteousness
[1:12:18] see you had no righteousness while you
[1:12:20] were a sinner what fruit had ye then in
[1:12:23] those things whereof you're now ashamed
[1:12:25] for the end of those things is death
[1:12:26] what good came out of all my sports
[1:12:28] worship what good came out of all those
[1:12:30] movies I wasted all that money on I had
[1:12:33] a whole brother Austin I had a whole I
[1:12:35] had a whole shelf of all these movies I
[1:12:37] bought what a waste of money what fruit
[1:12:39] isn't any of that there's no fruit in
[1:12:42] that but now I can put the money in and
[1:12:45] now I can have all the books of the
[1:12:46] Bible L now I can have brother sermons
[1:12:48] lined up
[1:12:51] Hallelujah you got
[1:12:54] fruit the end of all sin is death or
[1:12:57] separation from God but now you're made
[1:13:00] free from sin you became Servants of God
[1:13:02] have your fruit unto Holiness and the
[1:13:04] end everlasting
[1:13:06] life for the wages of sin is death see
[1:13:10] that's what we deserve that's what
[1:13:11] that's what we deserve a paycheck for
[1:13:13] right our paycheck we deserve is
[1:13:17] death right that's what we that's what
[1:13:19] we've earned we we've worked for it
[1:13:20] through our sins but instead of that God
[1:13:23] gives us the gift of God which is
[1:13:26] eternal life through Jesus Christ Our
[1:13:28] Lord amen Jesus took our sin that for us
[1:13:32] so that we can have eternal life amen so
[1:13:36] let us not let sin reain in our bodies
[1:13:39] amen and let us yield to God I'm closing
[1:13:42] with this thought the power of one so
[1:13:45] getting back to uh getting back to
[1:13:47] Romans 8 I'm sorry
[1:13:52] 5:18 the Bible said one man's sin cus
[1:13:56] one man's Disobedience C everyone to sin
[1:13:58] but one man's righteousness made many
[1:14:02] righteous I found this sermon here I'm
[1:14:04] going to just read a few portions do you
[1:14:06] ever hear of the parable of the
[1:14:09] nail one day there was a
[1:14:14] nail there was a nail on the church
[1:14:16] building kind of like they're replacing
[1:14:18] that that roof over there you see how
[1:14:19] they were replacing the roof over there
[1:14:21] you see those guys work they were there
[1:14:22] they were there working yesterday they
[1:14:23] took it off they're putting it
[1:14:25] on one of those Nails said oh they won't
[1:14:28] miss me they don't need me nobody likes
[1:14:30] me after all this is a big beautiful
[1:14:32] building it has stained glass windows
[1:14:34] plush carpet painted walls a beautiful
[1:14:36] pulpit and chandeliers I'm just a little
[1:14:38] nail holding down a sing a shingle on
[1:14:41] the roof I'm not important anybody ever
[1:14:44] felt that way before I'm just nobody in
[1:14:46] the
[1:14:47] church all they need is brother Jesse
[1:14:49] all they need is brother amen I nobody
[1:14:52] they they could have service without me
[1:14:54] don't ever think that we can't have
[1:14:56] service without you we're a really small
[1:14:59] church so it's almost true
[1:15:03] literally he says so the nail worked
[1:15:05] itself loose and fell to the ground it
[1:15:07] began to rain and the nail was buried in
[1:15:08] the mud and began to rust the shingle
[1:15:11] loosened and Rain began to leak into the
[1:15:13] beautiful
[1:15:14] building the rain the water stained the
[1:15:16] pews Pulpit walls and carpet all because
[1:15:19] the nail felt it was not important so
[1:15:22] here we see the importance of one
[1:15:24] nail somewhere in our house my wife
[1:15:26] could tell you we got a leak of water
[1:15:28] somewhere and because we got one leak in
[1:15:30] in our house our wood floors in our
[1:15:32] kitchen is now it's
[1:15:35] unstable right because of one
[1:15:38] leak right the power of one leak right
[1:15:42] now this is the negative right the power
[1:15:44] of one leak how many ever how many ever
[1:15:47] had just one problem but it led to so
[1:15:49] many other
[1:15:50] problems ever had that before the only
[1:15:57] one one thing can make a huge difference
[1:16:00] did you know this I look this up on this
[1:16:01] gentleman's sermon California Oregon and
[1:16:04] Washington all became States because of
[1:16:06] one
[1:16:07] vote think about that who's ever enjoyed
[1:16:09] going to California you've been to
[1:16:10] California I've been there
[1:16:12] too one vote made the difference because
[1:16:15] so one person's vote now look look at it
[1:16:17] today look how valuable the land is
[1:16:19] today because of one person one person
[1:16:21] made a difference
[1:16:23] now here's the sad part but one woman
[1:16:26] meline Murray O'Hare was responsible for
[1:16:29] the 1963 Supreme Court decision to ban
[1:16:31] prayer in public schools one
[1:16:35] woman and no no no no wonder Church
[1:16:38] brother R said women uh he warned about
[1:16:42] women getting the right to vote and not
[1:16:43] Holy Ghost for women but most women are
[1:16:46] sinners right and look what these women
[1:16:48] these s Sinners these sinful women have
[1:16:51] done right
[1:16:53] that's who that's who the left and the
[1:16:55] The Crazy Ones go after all the time
[1:16:56] they they work on their emotions of the
[1:16:58] women now there's just as many evil men
[1:16:59] as well but I'm just saying look at that
[1:17:01] and people will bash brother Brandon
[1:17:03] because he was against giving women the
[1:17:04] right to vote but look at the wisdom
[1:17:06] look at the foresight of God right right
[1:17:09] that they brought all this in prayer out
[1:17:11] and you know also the Supreme Court
[1:17:13] decision roie Wade was a woman over 60
[1:17:17] million abortions because of one
[1:17:20] woman right and of course all the corrup
[1:17:22] judges on there but it was brought by
[1:17:24] this one
[1:17:26] woman remember uh of course Eve Adam
[1:17:29] Adam and Eve one
[1:17:31] Disobedience aen one man sin brought
[1:17:35] death to 30
[1:17:37] Israelis you can hardly
[1:17:39] emphasize the power of
[1:17:43] one but let's look at the good side it's
[1:17:46] estimated there was 25 million people in
[1:17:48] the days of Noah but one man found Grace
[1:17:51] in the sight of the Lord praise God The
[1:17:53] Power of One
[1:17:54] Man Hallelujah and now we can all Trace
[1:17:58] our natural DNA back there and also our
[1:18:00] spiritual DNA Hallelujah believing God
[1:18:04] trusting in God for Grace Saving Grace
[1:18:07] Hallelujah because of one
[1:18:11] man Hallelujah yeah the estimate 25
[1:18:14] million people through Abraham one man
[1:18:19] every nation is blessed because of one
[1:18:21] man decided I will leave my my parents
[1:18:25] I'll leave my my idols and I'll go
[1:18:27] follow the the voice of God amen glory
[1:18:31] I'll forsake all my family and I'll
[1:18:33] follow this voice this holy voice that I
[1:18:35] hear amen because of One Man United
[1:18:39] States is blessed Hallelujah right
[1:18:41] because one man Abraham and that's true
[1:18:44] for every single nation under Earth I
[1:18:47] wish I could get off the globe every
[1:18:49] single nation is blessed because one man
[1:18:52] decided to believe God despite all his
[1:18:54] frustrations despite he was 75 years old
[1:18:57] and had no children and hadn't seen God
[1:19:00] move yet despite all that because of his
[1:19:02] simple Faith God's blessed all of us
[1:19:04] praise God Amen the power of one
[1:19:09] man said he can just get one man he said
[1:19:11] or woman in his hand God can do amazing
[1:19:15] things
[1:19:17] Hallelujah all nations are blessed
[1:19:19] because of one man one man Moses brought
[1:19:22] out two million people out of Egypt one
[1:19:25] man but who saved that man
[1:19:28] Zora Hallelujah one woman saved that man
[1:19:31] as well see she played a great part in
[1:19:34] there Jonah had the greatest Revival
[1:19:36] ever according the Bible
[1:19:39] 250,000 people saved in Nineveh because
[1:19:42] of one man now God had to spank him to
[1:19:45] get him there sometimes God's got to
[1:19:47] spank us to get us places but God's will
[1:19:50] is going to be done hallelujah you can
[1:19:53] run from God's call for your life you
[1:19:55] can run run run but God's going to get
[1:19:57] you in the right place if you're a child
[1:19:58] of God you're eventually going to say
[1:20:00] Lord I Surrender I'm nothing special I I
[1:20:03] can't guide my life I need you to guide
[1:20:05] my life Hallelujah one
[1:20:09] man used by God
[1:20:13] hallelujah now the reason I brought this
[1:20:14] in because brother or brother cam sorry
[1:20:17] brother cam preach those sermons one of
[1:20:19] you will chase a thousand yes five of
[1:20:22] you will chase
[1:20:23] 10,000 right and this struck me wow the
[1:20:26] power of
[1:20:28] one Adam produced all this death Adam
[1:20:31] and Eve produced all this death but
[1:20:33] Christ produced all this
[1:20:34] righteousness The Power of One
[1:20:37] Man hallelujah how many of you there's
[1:20:40] power in one
[1:20:41] man so there's the
[1:20:44] scripture remember these scriptures show
[1:20:47] when Israel came out of I'm Sor when
[1:20:50] they got ready to cross over there was
[1:20:51] 6001
[1:20:53] 1,730 fighting men that Joshua was able
[1:20:56] to take in the promised land so they
[1:20:58] calculate over 2.5 million people were
[1:21:01] with
[1:21:03] Joshua and chur think about this on the
[1:21:05] day of atonement all their sins were
[1:21:08] placed upon those two goats one was
[1:21:11] killed the scapegoat was sent away and
[1:21:14] on that day all the sins of two and a
[1:21:17] half million people were forgiven in one
[1:21:20] day amen
[1:21:23] Hallelujah I tried to figure it out on
[1:21:25] the calculator it wouldn't even I didn't
[1:21:26] have enough room for the zeros on how
[1:21:27] many sins that would be there's not
[1:21:29] enough room on there and God did that as
[1:21:32] the Old Testament type of what Jesus
[1:21:35] Christ would do for us praise God that's
[1:21:37] a type the power of of of those of those
[1:21:41] goats the scapegoat the power of the
[1:21:43] scapegoat and here the power of Christ
[1:21:45] becoming our sin for us that we might be
[1:21:49] forgiven so don't think J God's going to
[1:21:51] hold your sin against you he can't it's
[1:21:54] already it's already paid for praise God
[1:21:57] if you confess it he's right there to
[1:21:59] comfort you amen and say my father will
[1:22:02] forgive
[1:22:03] you my father loves you hallelujah amen
[1:22:07] you're God's beloved remember that so
[1:22:10] think about that all those millions of
[1:22:12] sins all those I mean as billions of
[1:22:14] billions of sins of all those people all
[1:22:16] of it could be wiped out one day by the
[1:22:18] pure
[1:22:21] sacrifice
[1:22:23] amen there's five of you will chase 100
[1:22:27] 100 you should put 10,000 to
[1:22:32] flight now here here now this is just
[1:22:34] encouraging for us I'm trying to close
[1:22:36] here I'm probably get an hour and a half
[1:22:40] here Moses is writing about Israel he
[1:22:42] said they are a nation void of counsel
[1:22:45] neither is there any understanding in
[1:22:46] them oh that they were wise that they
[1:22:48] understood this that they would consider
[1:22:50] this their latter end how should one
[1:22:52] Chase a thousand and put 10,000 to fly
[1:22:54] except their Rock had sold them and the
[1:22:57] Lord had shut them up in other words
[1:23:00] Israel for God the only reason I have
[1:23:02] Supernatural power the only reason
[1:23:04] there're Supernatural working here is
[1:23:05] because God has done it for
[1:23:07] us see they lost all their
[1:23:10] pride this wasn't my power that did this
[1:23:13] this was God's power brother C was
[1:23:15] preaching one of you can chase a
[1:23:17] thousand now how many want that power
[1:23:18] praise
[1:23:19] God we want it and we got to remember
[1:23:22] it's always God's power it's not our
[1:23:24] power that's what we see in Romans 6
[1:23:27] Romans 5 it's through one man one man
[1:23:32] chased a a million one man traced a
[1:23:34] trillion Hallelujah Jesus took all of
[1:23:36] our sins away for their rock is not as
[1:23:39] our Rock even our enemies themselves
[1:23:41] being judges and then I'm going to close
[1:23:44] with this here last
[1:23:46] scripture let him know that he which
[1:23:48] converteth The Sinner from the air of
[1:23:50] his way shall save soul from death and
[1:23:54] shall hide a multitude of sins to me
[1:23:58] church this is the New Testament
[1:24:00] equivalent for the Old Testament type of
[1:24:03] one's Warrior can kill a thousand like
[1:24:05] Samson this is the New Testament if you
[1:24:08] point one person to
[1:24:10] Christ it's as if you drove away
[1:24:13] multitudes of
[1:24:14] sins one of you can chase away a
[1:24:17] multitude of sins by pointing someone to
[1:24:19] Christ amen hallelujah fighting a
[1:24:23] natural battle right now we have to get
[1:24:24] out our guns and our
[1:24:26] ARS it's a legal right but that's not
[1:24:30] what God is talking about God's asking
[1:24:32] can we convert someone and can we show
[1:24:35] them the gospel that the gospel will
[1:24:37] show them that all their sins are
[1:24:39] scattered away all their sins are sent
[1:24:43] away to me this is the equivalent that
[1:24:45] we can have Hallelujah of one person can
[1:24:48] chase away a multitude of sin how many
[1:24:51] believe that's possible today amen amen
[1:24:53] let's s our
[1:24:55] feet musicians can come
[1:25:08] here I wanted to read this to the power
[1:25:10] of one Dr Seuss was of course a
[1:25:12] children's author I always have
[1:25:14] children's books in my room so I
[1:25:16] remember this quote he wrote to the
[1:25:18] world you may be one person but to one
[1:25:21] person you may be the
[1:25:24] world I like that
[1:25:26] thought you know in our eyes who am I
[1:25:29] I'm just one little pastor this whole
[1:25:32] world that's true you might be one
[1:25:34] little person but to one person you
[1:25:36] might be their entire
[1:25:39] world you might be the reason they get
[1:25:41] saved you might be the reason they serve
[1:25:44] Christ because of
[1:25:46] you so I want to show I want to end with
[1:25:48] that the power one if Jesus had the
[1:25:50] power of one in his life and we've got
[1:25:52] the spirit of Jesus guess what you can
[1:25:55] have the power in your life as well you
[1:25:57] have a great influence in your life as
[1:25:59] long as you're identify with Christ how
[1:26:01] many identified with
[1:26:03] Christ well Jesse you're quoting Dr
[1:26:05] Seuss well that really came from the
[1:26:07] Bible because in SEC 2 Samuel 18 they
[1:26:10] said David you won't go fight for us
[1:26:12] because you're worth 10,000 of
[1:26:15] us right in other words you're worth the
[1:26:18] world to us we can't lose you
[1:26:23] that's how we should feel towards Christ
[1:26:25] amen but there's going to be people in
[1:26:27] your life and some of you already have
[1:26:30] them that because of you because of your
[1:26:33] prayers because of your life you've
[1:26:35] helped lead them to Christ and you've
[1:26:37] converted somebody from a multitude of
[1:26:40] sin like for me it's like brother cam
[1:26:42] brother
[1:26:44] Cy who got me listening to
[1:26:47] Jesus who showed me the
[1:26:51] message is there any way I can pay them
[1:26:53] back there's no way I can pay them
[1:26:57] back
[1:26:59] Hallelujah think about someone who's
[1:27:01] made an impact in your
[1:27:04] life there's power in one
[1:27:07] person that impacted you now may God
[1:27:10] help us to be the one person that we can
[1:27:13] mean the world
[1:27:15] to how many want to be that person to
[1:27:17] somebody I want to be that person to
[1:27:19] somebody let's have a word of
[1:27:21] Prayer
