[0:00] I enjoyed it and I appreciate
[0:03] you he must have really have to push you
[0:05] a little bit but you got up there didn't
[0:09] you we appreciate it amen sometimes God
[0:12] has to push but once once we get there
[0:15] we feel better amen so we thank the Lord
[0:18] and we thank the Lord for his grace and
[0:20] his mercy and
[0:22] uh all that God is doing for us uh we're
[0:26] not going to be long tonight we'll do
[0:27] our best to uh give you the very thought
[0:30] the which God has given to us and um and
[0:33] um and then then we'll uh Journey on by
[0:37] the grace of the Lord I love the Lord I
[0:40] love worshiping him that song Always
[0:42] tear me up I I always think how without
[0:46] the blood of Jesus
[0:48] Christ I'm just a
[0:52] mess and uh I'm I'm the first to confess
[0:55] to that because I know where I came from
[1:00] what I used to be and what I am now and
[1:03] I can see where God has brought me and
[1:05] where he's taken me and I can truly say
[1:08] I'm not the man I used to be and I've
[1:11] seen changes in my life year by year and
[1:15] uh you know so that's what that's what
[1:17] keeps me going is not because I know so
[1:20] much more it's because I see the changes
[1:24] how God is changing Me From the Inside
[1:26] Out amen Genesis 3 please
[1:30] Genesis the 3r chapter 9 through the
[1:33] 13th
[1:34] verse how often I tried to change
[1:38] myself and uh when you try to change
[1:41] yourself you're in for a great
[1:45] disappointment but when you ask God to
[1:47] change you you put it in his hands and
[1:50] he's obligated to change you often times
[1:53] God want to hear that you want to be
[1:55] changed because there are so many people
[1:58] you know they really don't want to be
[2:00] changed but if you really are a
[2:03] Christian you get sick and tired of
[2:05] being sick and tired you get tired of
[2:08] your feeling and you get tired of all
[2:10] your thoughts and you know uh even your
[2:14] thoughts get on your
[2:16] nerves when they're not like the way the
[2:19] word the word want them to be you know
[2:21] so any anyhow Genesis 3:9
[2:24] through3 and the Lord God called unto
[2:26] Adam and said unto him where art thou
[2:30] and he said I heard thy voice in the
[2:32] garden and I was afraid because I was
[2:35] naked and hid myself and he said who
[2:38] told thee that thou was naked hast thou
[2:42] eaten of the tree whereof I command thee
[2:45] that thou should not eat and the man
[2:48] said the woman whom thou gavest to be
[2:51] with me she gave me of the tree and I
[2:54] did eat and the Lord said unto the woman
[2:57] what is this that thou Hast done and the
[3:00] woman said the serpent beg God me and I
[3:02] did eat amen jump down to the 21st verse
[3:08] unto Adam also and to his wife did the
[3:10] Lord God make coats of skin and clothe
[3:12] with them and the Lord said behold the
[3:15] man is become as one of us to know good
[3:18] and evil and now let us let he put forth
[3:21] his hand and take also of the tree of
[3:24] life and eat and live forever therefore
[3:27] the Lord God sent him forth from the
[3:29] garden of Eden to tear the ground from
[3:32] whence he was
[3:34] taken let us pray father God we come
[3:37] before you Lord as humbly as we know how
[3:39] and we thank you for your grace your
[3:42] mercy and the reading of your word we
[3:44] pray father God that you bless the word
[3:46] bless it here today today as we approach
[3:50] your throne you're the only one that
[3:52] could break the bread and father we pray
[3:54] that you break the bread of life Lord
[3:57] fit something into our hearts that will
[3:59] never forget fit something in our heart
[4:02] that would change us fit something in
[4:05] our heart that would bring us closer to
[4:07] you most of all we ask that you give
[4:10] Grant to us a love that we may love you
[4:15] more than ourselves bless us now in
[4:18] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may
[4:21] be
[4:28] seated uh uh my subject this morning or
[4:31] tonight is the
[4:33] proof the
[4:35] proof of of of perfect
[4:41] love I I I believe that uh when God uh
[4:46] began to work here in the Garden of
[4:49] Eden he began to show us something even
[4:52] by
[4:53] himself you see God always desire his
[4:57] his will is for us to forgive each other
[5:01] uh if you if you take note to the
[5:03] scripture in which I read Adam and Eve
[5:06] had sinned against God and God had
[5:08] already told them that the day that you
[5:10] eat of this tree you should surely die
[5:13] but in the midst of all of this
[5:16] God provided a
[5:18] sacrifice and that was a lamb that was
[5:21] to show them that they were forgiven and
[5:24] even though they had transgressed God
[5:26] was the first to forgive because in
[5:29] reality they were supposed to die uh
[5:32] both physically and spiritually but God
[5:35] allowed them to live and to carry on and
[5:38] I just believe that when we get to
[5:40] heaven we'll meet them and the reason
[5:43] being how do I know God forgave them
[5:45] because God took a lamb as I said this
[5:49] morning and the lamb had to be a perfect
[5:51] lamb so the lamb became a substitute for
[5:55] Adam you understand me so that that lamb
[5:59] that repr represented the righteousness
[6:00] of God Amen was accepted as the
[6:04] substitute for Adam and Eve's sin love
[6:07] is displayed like that see God is love
[6:11] and God God uh he knows how to hate you
[6:15] understand that but God did not hate
[6:17] Adam and Eve because they were made in
[6:19] his very image and likeness they were
[6:21] actually a part of God Amen in so much
[6:25] that God made them uh little gods or
[6:27] amateur Gods Over the Garden of Eden and
[6:30] it's amazing that that Adam Not only was
[6:33] the god of of the land but he also was
[6:37] the god of the sea he was the god of
[6:40] God's creation and we know that
[6:42] everything had to obey him so we look at
[6:46] these things and we understand that uh
[6:49] forgiveness uh is displayed uh is one of
[6:53] the great attributes of divine love or
[6:57] perfect or perfection amen and what what
[7:01] what God did uh he also showed in the
[7:05] garden here that uh Adam and Eve once
[7:08] sinning against God uh was no longer
[7:11] friends of God they were actually had
[7:13] become enemy they had joined the enemy
[7:16] side when they listen to the devil and
[7:18] that's what we do but God has has a a
[7:22] plan for us amen and everybody that
[7:25] really is disobedient to the word and
[7:28] knows the word and and just will
[7:29] willfully become disobedient to the word
[7:31] becomes an enemy of the word so we
[7:34] realize by the grace of God here it was
[7:37] God Amen is uh forgiving Adam and Eve
[7:40] and and he did this so that we will know
[7:43] amen that God's will is to
[7:46] forgive right I mean you know we'll jump
[7:49] there in just a minute uh it is the
[7:51] doorway uh to Perfection uh forgiveness
[7:55] you know God uh wants everyone to
[7:57] forgive and and as I said he started uh
[8:01] with the Lord himself forgiving Adam and
[8:03] Eve now the thing that I love about this
[8:07] is that not only did God forgive Adam
[8:10] and Eve but he provided a way uh for
[8:13] them because he knew now that they have
[8:16] become like like Gods knowing good and
[8:19] evil that that one sin would just be the
[8:21] beginning of their
[8:23] downfall the Bible doesn't record how
[8:25] many times Adam and Eve sinned since
[8:28] after they fell but we know by God's
[8:30] grace that the very nature of God that
[8:33] once protected them was no longer there
[8:36] uh the the the very uh how can I say it
[8:40] the um the very cloth of the very uh
[8:43] clothes of Adam and Eve uh was taken
[8:47] back from them and and given back back
[8:49] to God Amen and that was God's
[8:52] protection that's why they didn't know
[8:54] they were naked Hallelujah because God
[8:57] protected them from those kind of a
[9:00] things now we look at this thing and we
[9:02] we think uh not much of it we we say
[9:05] well well God why did God in the
[9:09] law had the eye for an eye and a tooth
[9:12] for a tooth because he wanted the law he
[9:15] wanted the that that that Foundation a
[9:18] strong Foundation to show you that
[9:20] really that's not the way God thinks in
[9:23] other words that's not his perfect will
[9:25] his perfect will is to forgive you to
[9:28] forgive your enemy
[9:29] but we find out that of course when it
[9:32] came to the Jewish people and they they
[9:35] look at them now uh when when there
[9:37] could be some forgiving and and some
[9:40] mercy somewhere they're still under the
[9:42] umbrella of ey for an eye and a two for
[9:45] tooth and this is why people can't
[9:48] understand the Jewish uh people today
[9:51] because they're not living under the
[9:52] Gentiles laws they're living under the
[9:55] law of God and if you do evil to me I'm
[9:59] going to do evil to you see this is what
[10:02] stumbled even the Jews when Jesus Christ
[10:06] came in his day who was the grace and
[10:09] mercy of God and he said forgive those
[10:11] that spitefully use you oh they couldn't
[10:14] understand that because they always have
[10:17] been taught an eye for an eye and when
[10:19] he when he said pray for those who speak
[10:21] evil of you and and and all of these
[10:24] things that were contrary to the very
[10:27] law in which they were taught you got to
[10:29] understand that this thing was so
[10:31] traditional traditionally ingrained in
[10:35] them till it basically became part of
[10:37] their DNA they really didn't know how to
[10:40] forgive they didn't know how to pray
[10:44] right and think about it even when Jesus
[10:47] was asked the questions Lord teach us
[10:48] how to pray and when he said forgive
[10:51] those amen who trustpass against you
[10:55] forgiveness that was was uh wasn't even
[10:58] in their vocabulary
[10:59] as such because in the law if if
[11:02] somebody even killed a
[11:04] relative uh they had the right to go
[11:07] find him and kill him and God had to
[11:11] establish what we call a City of Refuge
[11:14] where they could run and hide right
[11:17] because it was so ingrained that they
[11:19] would take years to wait on that person
[11:22] to avenge them of their relative it was
[11:26] in them and it's still in them today
[11:30] but the Bride of Jesus Christ she is the
[11:32] grace of God she is the mercy of God
[11:37] yall understand me she is the woman
[11:39] caught in adultery the LA wanted to
[11:42] Stone her but Grace and Truth says where
[11:46] is your
[11:47] accuser you see that's the kind of love
[11:51] and forgiveness God wants us to have it
[11:54] wasn't that she wasn't
[11:56] guilty but she was and and Jesus said
[12:00] listen where's your cons accusers in
[12:04] other words there's nobody to charge sin
[12:06] against you neither will I well that was
[12:09] so contrary to the law well of course
[12:12] you know nobody could keep the law you
[12:15] it was always partial and political and
[12:17] they brought the woman and left out the
[12:19] man when according to the law they both
[12:22] should have been brought there and they
[12:23] both should have been stoned see and
[12:25] that's how people even in that day was
[12:28] able to manipulate the law right oh yes
[12:32] even the Pharisees and the Sadducees
[12:34] they manipulated the law because even
[12:37] when Jesus healed on the on the day of
[12:39] the Sabbath they said it was unlawful
[12:41] they wanted to Stone him and Jesus
[12:43] corrected them said but you the one
[12:45] who's a hypocrite because if your mule
[12:48] or your donkey or whatever would fall in
[12:50] the ditch you would go get him out but
[12:52] here's a woman amen a daughter of
[12:54] Abraham that needs help and healing on
[12:57] that day and you won't serve Mercy to
[13:00] her Hallelujah he had to come he was the
[13:03] very essence of
[13:05] forgiveness he had to show them what
[13:08] Grace
[13:09] was right and he was perfect he did
[13:13] everything the father told him to do
[13:15] there was nothing he came short in y'all
[13:19] understand what I'm saying and the
[13:20] reason being because he had to cover
[13:23] your failure he had to cover my failure
[13:27] he's my perfection
[13:29] he's my perfect Grace he's my perfect
[13:34] forgiveness Hallelujah is that right
[13:37] remember when Jesus died on the
[13:40] cross he didn't forgive some he forgave
[13:44] all the whole world was saved by the
[13:48] blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah even to
[13:51] this day the whole world is still saved
[13:54] by the blood of Jesus Christ the only
[13:57] reason why people are lost is because
[13:59] they will not accept their
[14:03] atonement Hallelujah y'all understand
[14:06] what I'm saying his mercy and Grace is
[14:08] still here until the blood is taken from
[14:13] The Mercy
[14:14] Seat Hallelujah Matthew 1823
[14:19] 2035 I'll keep going with this in just a
[14:22] moment because I believe that it steps
[14:25] it steps and then when you come to
[14:27] brotherly kindness and just before
[14:30] perfect love because you see in between
[14:32] there is always a brother is always a
[14:37] sister somebody is going to offend you
[14:40] somebody is going to do harmful y'all
[14:43] understand what I'm trying to say before
[14:46] you reach that level where Christ
[14:49] reached that level right somewhere right
[14:52] in there there must be something or
[14:55] someone you must forgive
[14:59] yes I try to prove it in just a
[15:02] moment see sometime people people think
[15:05] you you don't have to forgive you've got
[15:07] to forgive and if you are a True
[15:09] Believer you want to forgive but let me
[15:12] tell you something forgiveness is not
[15:14] always
[15:17] easy you need God to help
[15:21] you but listen I can tell you what when
[15:24] you say oh I don't forgave this person
[15:26] or I forgave that person as long as you
[15:28] feel these funny
[15:30] feelings it's not true the devil has
[15:33] lied to you you still got a problem that
[15:36] needs to be
[15:38] resolved yall understand me until you
[15:41] can see the person that you say you you
[15:45] forgiven and yet you have a problem in
[15:47] your feelings you have not forgiven
[15:49] there's still a little ounce of
[15:51] something there and most of that can
[15:54] only come by way of prayer you said
[15:57] brother what's what you talking about I
[15:59] know what I'm talking
[16:00] about I was offended and it took three
[16:03] and a half years or even more to
[16:09] forgive but I said it with my
[16:14] mouth Yes and I meant it with my
[16:18] mouth but the heart is
[16:22] deceitful you understand me but every
[16:25] time somebody would bring that brother's
[16:27] name up I feel that thing and when
[16:30] somebody would like that brother I'm
[16:32] like wait a
[16:34] minute I'm just being
[16:37] honest I'm just being honest but I would
[16:40] go to God In Prayer Lord deliver
[16:44] me deliver me it wasn't deliver the
[16:47] brother deliver
[16:50] me and that that that that prayer I kept
[16:53] praying it you know people would I mean
[16:56] it would just catch me off God brother
[16:59] you think you done forgot about it and
[17:01] somebody said well you know so and so
[17:02] and so and I think boom here's that
[17:05] feeling all over again and that's when I
[17:08] knew I need to get before
[17:10] God I had done all the
[17:13] confessing confessed to the brother even
[17:16] even allowed myself to be defrauded when
[17:19] I knew I was right I confessed to be
[17:21] wrong you understand me I did all of
[17:24] that to bring peace but it never would
[17:27] move y understand understand me but one
[17:31] day it
[17:34] disappeared you hear what I'm saying I
[17:36] don't know when it left me but it left
[17:39] me and I know to this day I would do
[17:42] anything for that brother if in need
[17:45] without even thinking about
[17:48] it y'all hear what I'm saying only God
[17:52] could move that out of my heart certain
[17:54] wounds are hurtful and they're deep and
[17:57] only God can move it but you cannot stop
[18:01] until God moves it you understand me you
[18:04] can't stop praying until God moves it
[18:07] now that's the human side of
[18:09] us but we know what's right we know
[18:13] what's right listen therefore is the
[18:15] kingdom of heaven like unto a certain
[18:18] King which would take account of his
[18:21] servants and when he had begun listen
[18:23] people said well you know when somebody
[18:25] do you wrong said don't you worry about
[18:27] it y'all know how we do it
[18:29] you reap what you
[18:31] Soul wrong
[18:35] attitude you know what your attitude
[18:37] supposed to be Lord have
[18:42] mercy and when he had begun to reckon
[18:46] one was bought unto him which owed him
[18:49] 10,000
[18:51] talents but as far for us let me let me
[18:54] I I just remember to say this you know
[18:56] one time I I had held this thing and it
[18:59] was against it was my my my one of my
[19:02] best friends in South
[19:04] Carolina I had the story all twisted for
[19:08] years when we were
[19:11] boys he came to my house with a gun and
[19:14] I thought he was upset with
[19:17] me I'm like and he's at my screen though
[19:20] come on out come on out I he's upset but
[19:23] I'm thinking he's upset at me when he
[19:24] was upset at someone else but he wanted
[19:27] me to come out so I could join with him
[19:30] to go fight somebody and I was thinking
[19:32] he' come to my house to kill
[19:35] me so I wouldn't go out to to and for
[19:39] years for years cuz we calm down you
[19:43] know and everything and so happened you
[19:46] know I even told his mama about that
[19:49] incident we were just that close like
[19:51] brothers but that thing always bothered
[19:53] me how could he get me my you know my
[19:55] best friend gets so angry at me he'd
[19:56] bring a gun to my house
[19:59] well it was just over a year or two ago
[20:02] he and I we were discussing and said
[20:04] what what you talking about bro he said
[20:06] I didn't bring that gun to the house to
[20:07] he you I he said these two guys jumped
[20:10] me and I needed you to help me go get
[20:13] them y understand what I'm saying so
[20:17] misunderstood but I held that thing like
[20:20] a
[20:21] trophy it was just that real and I had
[20:25] to confess to him bro I tell you what I
[20:27] I had it all messed up up we laughed
[20:29] about it then but it wasn't funny to me
[20:32] all those years all no matter how close
[20:35] we got how many things we did together I
[20:37] always thought about him bringing that
[20:39] gun to my house but that's the way the
[20:42] devil
[20:43] works you know it work he works that way
[20:46] anytime we can get the wrong information
[20:48] and get it all twisted up and and he can
[20:50] cause something to harden our heart
[20:52] about something he'll do it Hallelujah
[20:55] you understand me but listen the thing
[20:58] that that that something happened even
[21:00] in my family not long ago and I it
[21:02] wasn't toward me but one of my daughters
[21:05] wrote in the
[21:06] text that maturity a person who is
[21:09] mature is has the ability to confront
[21:13] the situation in a mature
[21:16] way you don't run from it you confront
[21:20] it Hallelujah let's move
[21:22] on but as far as he had not to pay now
[21:26] I'm inan what did I have you turn there
[21:29] Matthew 18
[21:32] 23-35 but as much as he had not to pay
[21:35] his Lord commanded him to be sold and
[21:37] his wife and his children and all that
[21:40] he had and payment to be made the
[21:42] servant therefore fell down and worship
[21:46] him saying Lord have mercy with me and I
[21:50] will pay thee all that's you that's me
[21:53] then the Lord of that servant was moved
[21:56] with compassion and loose him and
[21:59] forgave him the debt is that what we did
[22:02] God we've been a sinner we've done all
[22:05] these wicked things I need you to save
[22:07] me my debt is who can pay it forgive me
[22:12] Lord I've done evil and God's mercy have
[22:16] mercy on us he comes and forgive us of
[22:18] our debt he literally set us free yet we
[22:22] want to hold debt over somebody
[22:26] else you owe me a
[22:30] confession you owe me to make this
[22:34] right and you know what we tell
[22:36] everybody else but the
[22:40] person just so you
[22:42] know Hallelujah but that's not the will
[22:45] of
[22:46] God hallelujah y'all know it's the
[22:49] truth oh my goodness but the same
[22:53] servant went out and found one of his
[22:56] fellow servants which ow him a 100 Pence
[23:00] and he laid hands on him took him by the
[23:03] throat saying pay me that thou owest you
[23:07] can almost visualize it and his fellow
[23:11] servants fell down at his feet and
[23:13] besought him saying have patience with
[23:16] me and I will pay thee sometime people
[23:19] make mistakes they don't mean to do
[23:23] it Hallelujah you know I had to tell a
[23:26] person I said you know in my P life and
[23:29] I can be moody still
[23:31] today but moodiness is not of
[23:34] God so anyway I had to tell them I
[23:38] forgive me because sometimes these mood
[23:40] swings gets on me you know what I mean
[23:42] you should have seen me a few years
[23:44] earlier you know but but I'm better now
[23:48] than I used to be right so anyhow uh you
[23:52] you you you you you you want to charge
[23:54] people every time I think about how much
[23:57] God has has forgiven me how can I for
[24:00] not forgive
[24:03] others and his fellow servant fell down
[24:05] at his feet and besought him saying have
[24:08] patience with me and I will pay thee all
[24:12] you know y'all don't maybe some of you
[24:14] do but when you have come through a
[24:16] rough life and even as a young person
[24:20] people have done wor wicked things to
[24:22] you I remember the time when my brother
[24:25] and his friend join up together to beat
[24:28] me
[24:31] it was devastating to My Little Life
[24:35] y your brother joining forces with
[24:39] someone else to beat you
[24:42] up will I held that for a long time
[24:46] y'all don't understand me do you I held
[24:50] it I didn't understand it but you know
[24:53] what I had to forgive my
[24:57] brother I thought in my mind there's no
[24:59] way he could ever love me do and I'm
[25:01] talking about I'm in like the maybe the
[25:03] third fourth grade y'all understand me
[25:08] trauma and those things are hard to get
[25:10] rid of and only God can do
[25:14] it but in order to make Heaven you got
[25:17] to give it up Sir you got to forget
[25:21] about what happened to you you know oh
[25:24] this because this happened in my life
[25:26] I'm this way forget it it give it up
[25:31] cast your cares upon Jesus why because
[25:35] that kind of thing will deform you you
[25:37] have been transformed let it Transform
[25:40] You by the renewing of your mind let God
[25:44] wash away the heart and all the
[25:50] history I don't know who I'm talking to
[25:53] but I just hope somebody's being
[25:55] blessed we we are you you know I I've
[25:59] got so many things I could tell you and
[26:02] when I tell you let me say it like this
[26:04] when I came to Jesus Christ I was
[26:06] totally a mess and when I say rejected
[26:09] by my father you know the the the if it
[26:12] kind of said like this the black sheep
[26:13] of my family that kind of a thing and
[26:15] then when I Found Jesus you know that
[26:18] the church became a family y'all
[26:20] understand what I'm trying to say and
[26:21] then you find out in the church you'll
[26:23] have people to hurt you there
[26:27] too you can't get away from the pain you
[26:31] are the scars like the brother say in
[26:33] the song but it gives you
[26:36] wisdom it matures
[26:38] you Hallelujah is that right why because
[26:43] you want to in your heart you don't want
[26:45] nobody else to feel the kind of pain you
[26:47] felt when those things happen to
[26:50] you it is there so that if you meet
[26:53] somebody who's going through some of the
[26:55] same things or similar things in in
[26:57] their lives and they need to overcome
[26:59] then you can share
[27:00] it woo somebody now it's hard to share
[27:04] nowadays cuz people don't know how to
[27:06] keep things to
[27:09] themselves but there used to be a time
[27:11] you could talk to a Christian and they
[27:13] would hold that
[27:15] thing it would bring you closer together
[27:19] now you tell somebody Susie and Susie
[27:22] got a best friend she tells her best
[27:25] friend so amen it becomes a real bad
[27:29] situation right so what we do we hold
[27:33] it but you know it's it's against the
[27:36] word because the Bible said confess your
[27:39] faults one toward
[27:41] another we supposed to have love enough
[27:44] to share with one another some of our
[27:47] deepest
[27:48] hurts somebody can pray with you help
[27:52] you
[27:53] overcome only love can do this
[27:55] now I'm not talking about practic in is
[27:58] and I'm not talking about systematically
[28:00] doing it I'm talking about there must be
[28:02] somebody you know loves
[28:10] you so when Fellowship saw that what was
[28:13] done they were very sorry and I got to
[28:15] hurry up and came and told unto their
[28:17] lord all that was done in other words
[28:20] your attitude and your treatment toward
[28:22] your brothers and sisters is reported
[28:24] unto God
[28:28] and God it doesn't make him feel good
[28:30] about it because he's know how many
[28:33] times you come to him saying Lord have
[28:35] mercy he knows all the times that you
[28:38] know you were wrong and you did it
[28:40] anyway he's not talking about just sin
[28:42] he's talking about our
[28:44] iniquity And yet when somebody offends
[28:46] you or somebody across you you just want
[28:49] to hold it in your heart and bring it up
[28:51] like somebody you know regurgitating you
[28:53] know that's crazy you got you got only
[28:57] the pure in heart shall see God there is
[29:00] no way to escape that only the pure and
[29:03] heart shall see God and when your
[29:06] brothers and sisters make mistakes you
[29:08] supposed to make
[29:10] excuses for them did you know that
[29:13] brother Bram said you're supposed to
[29:14] make excuses for them you know they
[29:16] didn't mean to do that why because we
[29:20] don't wrestle against flesh and
[29:22] blood spiritual wickedness in high
[29:25] places and the best way of having a
[29:27] brother and sister to delivered is you
[29:29] pray for
[29:31] themen Hallelujah not talk about them
[29:34] and then
[29:35] pray pray for them Hallelujah then his
[29:40] Lord after that he had called him said
[29:42] unto him listen how God phrases this he
[29:46] said oh thou Wicked servant he calls you
[29:50] Wicked because you don't have the
[29:53] ability you won't you won't forgive he
[29:55] calls you Wicked
[29:58] yes sir sir I forgave thee all thy debt
[30:01] because thou desired me should not thou
[30:05] also have
[30:07] compassion on thy fellow servant even as
[30:10] I've had pity on
[30:13] thee and his Lord was wroth and
[30:16] delivered him to the tormentors till he
[30:19] should pay all that was due unto
[30:22] him what are the tormenters we don't
[30:25] know it could be a sickness
[30:28] cuz your body is not built to not
[30:32] forgive that's any kind of ailment
[30:35] torment you until you come to your
[30:40] senses to
[30:44] forgive till you should pay all that was
[30:47] due unto him and so likewise shall my
[30:50] heavenly father do also unto you if you
[30:52] forgive if you if ye from your heart
[30:55] forgive not everyone his brother need
[30:58] their trespasses right in other words
[31:01] God said I won't forgive you
[31:05] either listen people a lot of so-called
[31:09] Christians ready to cross over the line
[31:13] and all of a sudden they think about all
[31:14] of the people they've never
[31:16] forgiven where do you think they're
[31:19] going because if they don't forgive you
[31:22] can't cross the line and go
[31:26] up you you don't forgive them God can't
[31:29] forgive
[31:31] you Hallelujah is that all right acts
[31:35] 7:59 acts 7th chapter 59 verse 60 and
[31:40] they stoned Stephen calling upon God
[31:42] saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit see
[31:46] I I I we're talking about okay we we
[31:48] said God don't you know he's looking at
[31:50] the lamb but listen people because he's
[31:52] our righteousness doesn't mean that we
[31:54] shouldn't live
[31:56] righteously we supposed to live
[31:58] righteously he's our Holiness we
[32:01] supposed to live holy Listen People of
[32:03] God you can forgive one of the greatest
[32:06] enemies of of the of of of the of the
[32:09] word is first of all the king demon
[32:14] unbelief the second one is
[32:17] stubbornness some people know to do
[32:20] right but just don't don't want to do it
[32:23] you know why they got
[32:25] pride pride is just before the
[32:30] fall I was thinking about that I thought
[32:33] today and I I was just thinking when God
[32:35] called because I'm in Jeremiah and God
[32:37] call him stiff neck you know what stiff
[32:40] neck
[32:42] is you think I'm going to
[32:48] apologize stiff that neck up puff out
[32:51] that
[32:54] chest God said I hate that look
[32:58] Hallelujah and they stoned stepen
[33:01] calling upon God and saying Lord Jesus
[33:04] receive my spirit here's enough if if he
[33:08] confess to me then I confess to him
[33:11] wrong the Bible says if you think your
[33:14] brother has an ought against you you go
[33:16] to
[33:18] him y'all where all the
[33:23] amens and he kneel down and cried
[33:25] without a l listen let me tell y'all
[33:27] something something this has to God
[33:30] preached this to me before I can preach
[33:31] it to
[33:34] you I must be first partake of the fruit
[33:38] God comes to me first yes sir you see I
[33:41] can't preach this you like I was telling
[33:43] a brother a minister who don't pay his
[33:45] tithing I said how can you preach on
[33:47] tithing if you don't pay your
[33:50] tithing I said you're a hypocrite yes
[33:53] sir right I said you can't preach on
[33:56] tithing and you're not preach
[33:58] you're not paying them
[34:02] yourself and he kneeled down and cried
[34:05] with a loud voice Lord lay not this sin
[34:08] to their charge and when he had said
[34:11] this he fell
[34:14] asleep I had a sister uh uh uh I won't I
[34:18] won't call her name uh she had come to
[34:21] me and uh uh I I put it away the Lord
[34:24] told me that you know she would she was
[34:27] soon to die
[34:28] that the time on Earth was almost over
[34:31] and I went and um I talked to her about
[34:34] it and she didn't say anything at that
[34:38] time but
[34:41] uh about a month or two before she
[34:43] passed and nothing was wrong with my
[34:46] sister uh I the Lord told me go and tell
[34:49] her her time is shorter now then
[34:53] before and I said Lord if you show me
[34:57] where she's at I go tell her and the
[34:58] Lord showed me put in my heart where she
[35:00] was I went there she was there I called
[35:03] her out of the house that she was in we
[35:05] sat in a little swing area I told her
[35:08] what the Lord had said to me and she
[35:10] said to me I can't
[35:15] forgive and I didn't know what she was
[35:17] talking
[35:18] about but in her younger days she had
[35:21] been
[35:22] ravished uh by a
[35:24] man and she didn't know how to forgive
[35:26] him
[35:28] and I told her I says
[35:31] listen uh which explained to me her
[35:33] whole entire life and and this is this
[35:36] is really a sincere thing I'm telling
[35:38] you and she said uh I said to her I said
[35:42] listen we cannot forgive like God God
[35:46] can forgive and forget but we're built
[35:49] in a different way I said we'll never
[35:52] forget it I said but you can G you can
[35:55] you can forgive so much to if that
[35:57] person needed you you could help them
[35:59] without thinking about it immediately
[36:02] she said I
[36:04] forgive two months later she
[36:07] died and I had
[36:10] forgotten that she had once been a
[36:13] Christian and before she came before she
[36:16] died in sin God called her
[36:20] back God delivered her from cigarettes
[36:22] and
[36:23] everything she told me I I I I saw her
[36:27] even though it crushed my heart when the
[36:30] Lord took her I I I I I almost lost my
[36:33] mind but at the same time I
[36:36] knew God was rich in
[36:39] Mercy and she forgave and and and
[36:43] immediately she she didn't have the
[36:44] nervousness that she had she didn't have
[36:47] to smoke or anything see all of that
[36:49] stem from that point from that thing
[36:52] that happened to her when she was young
[36:55] top in her class you know she was at a
[36:58] time going to a Catholic School topping
[37:00] her class going to church made herself a
[37:03] Christian and when that happened she
[37:06] fell in all the years of her life she
[37:09] carried that
[37:11] thing yall understand me but God was
[37:14] rich in Mercy y'all understand me God is
[37:18] rich in Mercy now what is he telling
[37:22] you whatever is in your
[37:25] life forgive
[37:29] it was the devil it's not flesh and
[37:32] blood Satan knows who you are he's
[37:36] trying to stop the seed of God from
[37:39] coming to his Perfection that's his
[37:41] whole
[37:43] purpose you so brother Brook I don't
[37:45] know about that let me tell you
[37:48] something brother brother bam said Mary
[37:52] Magdalene became the person that she was
[37:55] because her mother and father put her
[37:57] out
[37:58] and made her go work for her life a
[38:02] living you think God wasn't aware but
[38:05] she was
[38:08] seed you understand me she was seed and
[38:11] God never called her nothing but a
[38:15] daughter he forgave
[38:17] her the record was
[38:20] clean he whom the son is set free is
[38:24] free
[38:26] indeed and it's as long as you got that
[38:28] root there is always a possibility of a
[38:32] tree to
[38:36] grow listen Mark
[38:39] 32829 said verily I say unto you all
[38:42] sins shall be forgiven Unto the Sons of
[38:44] men and blasphemy without soever with
[38:48] blasphemy wherewith soever they shall
[38:51] blaspheme but see even people blashe
[38:55] blaspheme against God but they don't
[38:57] blashe the Holy Ghost but he that shall
[39:00] blaspheme against the Holy Ghost have
[39:02] never forgiveness but is in danger of
[39:05] Eternal damnation and even God said if
[39:08] you hear a man blaspheming the Holy
[39:10] Ghost don't pray for him
[39:14] anymore that's the only thing every
[39:17] other sin is
[39:20] forgivable and therefore we are expected
[39:23] to forgive yes sir
[39:29] H I know it's tough but it's true do you
[39:33] want a pure heart do you want to be able
[39:36] to love your your not only your loved
[39:38] ones but also your enemies amen Amen
[39:42] brother love them and I'm not talking
[39:44] about feeling like you do but loving
[39:48] them man Jesus did it he knew Judas was
[39:51] a devil and yet he loved him the Bible
[39:53] said he did yes sir you say well I was
[39:57] just filio love well do you love them
[40:02] filiol that's a new word but
[40:05] nevertheless I'm asking the question
[40:08] right cuz even if you loved them in that
[40:11] filio love you you've achieved
[40:17] something Hallelujah love the Lord
[40:20] Genesis 28 I got to hurry coming on
[40:22] through Genesis 20 38 excuse me 18
[40:25] through through 25 and he said what
[40:27] pledge shall I give thee and he said thy
[40:31] signant and thy bracelet and thy staff
[40:35] that is in thine hand and he gave it her
[40:38] and came in unto her and she conceived
[40:41] by him and she arose and went away and
[40:44] laid by her her veil from her and put on
[40:47] a garment of her widowhood and Judah
[40:50] sent the kid by the hand of his friend
[40:53] to the adullamite to receive his pledge
[40:56] from the woman hand but he found her not
[41:00] then he asked of men of that place
[41:03] saying where is the Harlot that was
[41:05] openly by the wayside and and they said
[41:09] there was no harlot in this place and he
[41:12] returned to
[41:13] Judah and and said I cannot find her and
[41:17] also that the men of the place said
[41:20] that's there was no harot in this place
[41:23] and Judah said let her take it to
[41:25] herself let we be ashamed behold I sent
[41:29] this kid and thou has not found her and
[41:31] it came to pass about three months ago
[41:34] after that it was told Judah saying
[41:36] Tamar thy daughter-in-law have played
[41:39] the hollot and also behold she is with
[41:42] child by hom and Judah said bring her
[41:45] forth and let her be burnt and when she
[41:48] was brought forth she sent to her her
[41:51] father-in-law saying by the man whose
[41:55] whose these are am I with child child
[41:58] and she said discern I pray thee who are
[42:01] thee these the signant the bracelet and
[42:05] the staff
[42:10] now now I I do admire
[42:14] Tamar and the reason why I say that
[42:16] because Judah did her so
[42:19] unfairly he really treated her bad and
[42:23] yet she forgave him enough and she
[42:27] wanted God so
[42:28] much that she was willing to play a
[42:32] harlot to continue his seed line Y yall
[42:37] understand me her her ambition was not
[42:39] even for her her am ambition was for the
[42:43] line of Judah to
[42:45] continue and by that Judah himself never
[42:50] said oh I'm sorry you know how you know
[42:53] you you you big you know so now you're
[42:55] going to say well you're rightous
[42:57] business is better than mine that was
[42:58] his way of saying I'm
[43:01] sorry right and God so watered her that
[43:06] he gave her
[43:07] twins and then the lineage of Jesus
[43:10] comes out of
[43:13] her so
[43:15] forgiveness just being able you have no
[43:18] idea why God set traps for you and set
[43:21] things in your way but you must overcome
[43:26] them in your soul how can you be joyous
[43:30] in your soul if you still got that
[43:32] little bit of Darkness there it's going
[43:35] to always come up and torment you I'm
[43:38] telling you from
[43:42] experience is that right I don't have
[43:45] much longer Jacob and Esau I'm just
[43:47] giving examples now years of
[43:52] hatred and Esau was going to kill Jacob
[43:56] you stole my birth
[43:58] right you know how even so jealous
[44:01] brothers and
[44:03] sisters that thing could be ugly at
[44:06] times it can develop into
[44:09] hatred right especially if Mom or daddy
[44:13] like the younger or more than like the
[44:15] Elder however you want to say it but it
[44:17] happens in life it happens in the church
[44:21] people have
[44:23] favorites people get jealous of it right
[44:27] you got people who want to you know how
[44:29] how could I say it play the piano and
[44:31] they know they
[44:34] can't it it's crazy it really is but if
[44:38] you look beyond that that is the effect
[44:42] of something else happening down here
[44:45] the cause and the effect amen hallelujah
[44:49] remember when brother brownon went into
[44:51] the bar and he found this man who was a
[44:55] well used to be a I think he was a
[44:57] lawyer something like that and he had
[44:59] become an alcoholic only because his his
[45:02] wife left him for someone else but
[45:05] listen God found
[45:08] him you understand me God found
[45:13] him what about the woman a man who had
[45:16] the purple hair and the purple nails and
[45:20] purple everything thought she was lost
[45:23] and couldn't be
[45:25] redeemed huh hurtful things happen in
[45:28] her life God found her redeemed her
[45:34] saved her Sanctified her y'all
[45:38] understand me cuz she was a daughter of
[45:40] God he was a Son of
[45:43] God listen you can sit back all you want
[45:46] so well I don't have to forgive no you
[45:48] do
[45:49] not if that's going to make you
[45:51] comfortable and happy don't but at the
[45:54] end of the road you will have the
[45:57] pay for that you will have to give
[46:00] answer to God on why you did not forgive
[46:03] when he's forgiven you all your sinsu I
[46:07] love that song brother you know all of
[46:09] the millions of blessings and I don't
[46:11] deserve not even
[46:14] one anybody in here has been blessed and
[46:17] you feel like you deserve
[46:19] it no amen because God's mercy and Grace
[46:23] is with us we need to start sharing that
[46:26] with one another this is what a church
[46:27] is all about you can we can unite in
[46:30] such a way the devil won't have space a
[46:32] crack to get
[46:34] in amen hallelujah is that right so I'm
[46:38] almost done Jacob and Esau and and we we
[46:41] we we see in the uh the 33rd chapter of
[46:44] of of Genesis Jacob lifts up his eyes
[46:47] and look and behold Esau how many times
[46:50] we've seen that happen right we've got a
[46:53] problem with a brother or sister and we
[46:55] might be a at a meeting and all of a
[46:57] sudden boom they're there now you just
[47:00] finished
[47:05] shouting and they just popped up on you
[47:07] and you think oh Lord and the Holy Ghost
[47:10] say to you you better get it
[47:12] right you better get it right oh Lord
[47:15] I'll do it later you know how many of
[47:16] y'all have done that come on somebody am
[47:19] I the only one who can raise their hand
[47:21] I'mma raise my hand for me and
[47:25] you we do it we put put it off we put it
[47:27] off we put it off but finally God gets a
[47:31] hold of you and you say I can't go no
[47:33] longer with this I got to make it
[47:35] right and then when you get it make it
[47:37] right the people oh I didn't think
[47:39] nothing about it oh when you what you I
[47:42] didn't even pay that no attention but in
[47:44] your heart in your mind this thing is a
[47:45] big
[47:47] thing see see it's the devil that makes
[47:50] it like that now here come Jacob I love
[47:54] Jacob I love him that's why God say
[47:56] Jacob lift up up his ey he didn't say
[47:58] Israel lifted it up his name had been
[48:00] changing though but Jacob was the one
[48:02] that made met
[48:04] Esau even though his even though his
[48:07] name had been changed excuse
[48:13] me even God basically saying you acting
[48:17] like Jacob now you ain't acting like
[48:19] Israel so anyway he meets Esau and I
[48:23] still can't understand these men there's
[48:26] something things about Abraham I don't
[48:28] understand how he suffered his wife to
[48:30] be another
[48:32] man's and how Jacob you know they
[48:34] followed the same pattern you it moves
[48:36] on moves on and and now Jacob saying I
[48:41] tell you what I'm coming but y'all go
[48:43] before
[48:47] me he was willing for all of them to be
[48:50] wiped
[48:52] out he was hoping for the mercy and
[48:54] grace of God but you understand now
[48:58] under the law it was a eye for
[49:03] eye they they
[49:05] are in their heart they didn't they
[49:07] didn't know nothing about
[49:13] forgiveness y'all we we we we look at
[49:15] all of these things and and we know even
[49:18] even so when it comes to the law and all
[49:21] of these things that that did happen
[49:23] during that time uh we we never see God
[49:27] teaching on
[49:29] Grace so the human mind is
[49:33] Vengeance you say that's not true yes it
[49:36] is because when Abel was
[49:39] killed Abel's blood cried out for
[49:43] vengeance and that was in the heart of
[49:45] every man even before the law was
[49:47] given Vengeance venge me of my adversary
[49:52] that's why the scripture said that the
[49:54] blood of Jesus Christ speaketh better
[49:56] things than able
[49:57] CU Abel spoke Vengeance and Jesus Christ
[50:01] spoke Lord forgive them for they know
[50:03] not what they
[50:06] do put all them in front right and I'm
[50:10] almost
[50:11] done and what
[50:14] happened God was working on both
[50:17] ends and whenever God works on both ends
[50:20] we ought to be grateful unto the
[50:23] Lord because if God is softening your
[50:26] heart he's also softening the other
[50:28] person's heart too because his will is
[50:30] for us to
[50:33] forgive and if God is working on one
[50:36] person's heart he's Al so working on the
[50:38] other one so that he they will all both
[50:41] understand each other Satan will be
[50:44] defeated cuz Esau said in the ninth
[50:47] verse and I'm closing he said I have
[50:50] enough my brother keep that that thou H
[50:54] has unto thyself and in other words Esau
[50:57] could have killed all of Jacob's
[51:00] children their cattle their everything
[51:02] because remember Esau said I'm going to
[51:04] kill you basically said I'm GNA get you
[51:06] and Jacob with the help of his mother
[51:09] ran over to his father-in-law and stayed
[51:11] there for 14
[51:14] years that's a long time to hold a
[51:18] grudge and yet God was working on both
[51:21] blessing both and they come to an
[51:23] agreement and at the end of the story
[51:26] Jacob can now become Israel because he's
[51:29] forgiven his brother and his brother has
[51:31] forgiven him and in order for us to
[51:35] become what we call the Bride of Jesus
[51:37] Christ we got to have the spirit of
[51:40] forgiveness even as stepen had the
[51:43] spirit of forgiving forgiveness because
[51:45] I know myself if somebody's punching me
[51:48] in my face is going to take the Holy
[51:52] Ghost you can't do it on your
[51:55] own don't even don't even think it and
[51:58] I'm closing cuz remember I told you that
[52:00] one time you know I was jogging outside
[52:02] I was living in in Lia and and here come
[52:05] this big ferocious dog I don't know it
[52:08] was a rock W what it was it was a huge
[52:10] one and uh his master wasn't too far
[52:13] from him but wasn't close
[52:16] enough excuse
[52:18] me and I'm thinking to
[52:20] myself Lord I'm running I ain't I ain't
[52:23] running the opposite way yet but I'm
[52:25] running and that dog is getting closer
[52:28] and I'm thinking Lord remember when you
[52:30] calm that bull down remember what you
[52:33] did with the
[52:34] bees well that anointing never did
[52:40] come and I was so glad that man caught
[52:42] up with his big dog cuz I just felt like
[52:45] I was going to be eating alive that
[52:47] thing look so big and it was coming my
[52:48] way but then another time a different
[52:52] time down the road I'm running down the
[52:53] street from my house and this dog is on
[52:56] the other side of the street I see the
[52:59] dog break the chain he's coming my way
[53:01] and I'm running by a bush and I'm like I
[53:05] got to break this I'm gonna break this
[53:07] limb and the limb wouldn't
[53:10] break but the dog come just like that
[53:13] right like right there and stopped God
[53:17] is my witness he stopped and that's
[53:20] brother Brown said that boy look
[53:22] confused that dog looked confused and he
[53:25] turned around and there was another man
[53:26] on the other side of the street Crossing
[53:28] down by his house he turned and went
[53:30] over there and start barking at him and
[53:32] I continued
[53:33] running and I thought to myself Lord
[53:36] you're faithful you made me know it's
[53:38] not my will but your will whenever you
[53:41] determined this to happen that's when it
[53:43] happens so I witnessed that I'm a
[53:46] witness that God can can stop wild beast
[53:49] and that that dog was bad he he broke
[53:52] the chain I don't know whether it was
[53:54] because he saw me or what but I I just
[53:56] know that I was I was in a predicament
[53:58] that only God could help me out of and
[54:00] he
[54:01] did now that's my testimony but I just
[54:04] say by the grace of God people we need
[54:07] that when we when we say our prayer
[54:09] forgive us this day our daily bread give
[54:12] us this day our daily bread and forgive
[54:14] us of our debts as we forgive th give
[54:17] our debors we need to REM we need to
[54:20] really mean
[54:22] that and we need to clean we need to get
[54:24] before God and says Lord what's in my
[54:26] heart if there be anybody that I have an
[54:29] all I haven't forgiven please help me
[54:31] Lord help me forgive and if I need cuz
[54:34] some things you may hold against a
[54:36] person and has ne ne has never
[54:39] necessarily said anything to them well
[54:41] then if that that's something that you
[54:43] have en envisioned in your mind but if
[54:46] you know that person no then that's you
[54:49] need to go to that person but if you
[54:51] don't know that you know what I'm trying
[54:53] to say some things you don't have to say
[54:55] cuz I I've learned that sometimes when
[54:57] you try to make things right if a person
[54:59] don't know about it it makes it worse
[55:02] cuz now you done gave them a battle they
[55:04] didn't
[55:05] have it's the truth so sometimes you
[55:08] just between you and God cleanse me oh
[55:12] Lord right I want to re I want to make
[55:14] this com I want to make this this this
[55:17] Perfection and I know that I can't have
[55:19] anything against my brother or my sister
[55:23] and that's what the Bible said love your
[55:25] neighbor even as You Love love yourself
[55:27] let's stand let's
[55:43] stand you know some people even hate God
[55:46] because of things that happen in their
[55:53] lives but we never understand some times
[55:56] it takes certain things to mold and make
[55:58] us into the person that God wants us to
[56:00] be regard regardless to how tragical or
[56:04] how bad it it seemed to
[56:07] be God ain't ignorant God ain't stupid
[56:11] and everything that does or happen to us
[56:14] a true SE to God God saw it before it
[56:17] happened and he looks at us to see okay
[56:20] do you still trust me do you still love
[56:24] me are you willing toat even forgive now
[56:27] y'all y'all don't y' y'all hear what I'm
[56:29] saying Jesus Christ death was not an
[56:32] accident it was planned by God God saw
[56:36] everybody that was going to spit on him
[56:38] he saw he saw the people that was going
[56:40] to slap his face matter of fact God when
[56:43] God made them he ordained them to slap
[56:48] it this wasn't some random person that
[56:51] ran up to slap
[56:53] Jesus those that cursed him God when
[56:56] they were born they were born to curse
[56:59] him just like the people who pierced him
[57:02] in the side and those that nailed him to
[57:04] the
[57:04] Cross all that scene you can put it
[57:07] drama act or whatever every one of those
[57:10] players was right on stage right on
[57:13] point to do exactly what they were
[57:15] ordained to do and yet
[57:18] Jesus said Lord forgive them for they
[57:22] know not what they do think about what
[57:25] I'm saying
[57:26] people these people that have done us
[57:29] wrong and done evil to us you know they
[57:32] many of them don't even know what
[57:33] they've done
[57:35] really and and they don't even know the
[57:37] depth of the things they've done but
[57:39] it's our D we're
[57:41] bride we must
[57:44] forgive and we should have a desire to
[57:47] forgive I I don't like the feeling of
[57:50] not of having a problem with anybody
[57:54] that's very uncomfortable
[57:58] and
[58:01] so in saying all I say if there be
[58:03] something that you need to straighten
[58:04] out with
[58:06] me I'm willing I I I have nothing to
[58:10] hide and God is know God God is my
[58:13] witness I love the people of God and I
[58:15] want to be free and I want to be see
[58:17] everybody else
[58:18] free yeah let's have a word of prayer
[58:22] our gracious father God we come before
[58:24] you we thank you thank you for your
[58:26] grace we thank you for your mercy we
[58:29] thank you for being so good to us Lord
[58:32] without you who are we we're nothing
[58:36] Lord you made us who we are all our test
[58:40] and trials everything that we've have
[58:42] ever gone through has not been a hiccup
[58:45] in your program but father you
[58:48] predestinated everything the good and
[58:51] the bad but you have confidence in us
[58:55] that we will come come through even as
[58:57] job when job friends his best of friends
[59:01] no doubt job took care of them at time
[59:04] helped them at time but when he fell
[59:07] into a spot of Affliction they became
[59:10] his accusers but job never hated him no
[59:14] it even got to the place Lord God you
[59:16] had job to go uh uh his friends to come
[59:21] back and ask job to pray and the only
[59:24] way job could have prayed for his
[59:26] friends is that he had to forgive them
[59:29] of all they had said to him all they had
[59:32] done to
[59:33] him otherwise the prayers would not have
[59:36] been effective but before job could
[59:38] reach that that that that uh that ground
[59:43] that place where you wanted him to be he
[59:45] had to face his accusers and he had to
[59:49] forgive them that not only that they
[59:52] might live but that he would live as
[59:54] well father we thank you for father for
[59:56] all of the things that we see in the
[59:58] word of God that brings us to the place
[1:00:01] that that is your will to
[1:00:04] forgive and it's our your will for us to
[1:00:07] forgive no matter what it may be bless
[1:00:11] us Lord keep us Lord guide us Lord help
