[32:45] God Amen let's take our Bibles here as
[32:47] you're standing here let's go to Romans
[32:48] chapter nine I'd like to continue on
[32:50] this series here I think this is part 22
[32:52] we'll go to Romans 9:13 we'll pick up
[32:55] right where we left off last week
[32:59] Hallelujah I hope you've had a new
[33:01] appreciation for the Book of Romans I
[33:02] surely have I've surely enjoyed this
[33:05] just as much as any other books we
[33:06] preach through and especially last week
[33:09] with that Jacob and Esau thought that
[33:10] really blessed me and i' never seen it
[33:12] like that so I thank the Lord for giving
[33:14] us wisdom and uh Grace and understanding
[33:17] Hallelujah gives us confidence in Christ
[33:19] Hallelujah we get a lot of confidence in
[33:22] Christ Romans 9:13 we'll just read 13
[33:25] and 14
[33:33] and Lord willing on Sunday we'll have a
[33:35] regular service Lord willing uh I think
[33:37] Lydia Malachi and AAA will'll be out of
[33:39] town uh they got a youth meeting right
[33:41] on Saturday in Lima Ohio so that's right
[33:44] we need to pray for them for travel as
[33:46] well we're not going so Malachi and ly
[33:48] are going to do all the driving all by
[33:51] themselves maybe that's the first or
[33:53] second time that's happened so we really
[33:55] need to pray for them by God's grace gra
[33:58] pray for the parents too don't let me
[34:00] fool you there I'm not trying to fool
[34:02] anybody uh surely need prayer for them
[34:05] but looking forward to that you know
[34:06] they get a a lot of good Fellowship you
[34:08] know we don't get a lot of Fellowship in
[34:09] our church because we're just a small
[34:10] church but God want us to be that way
[34:12] God's given us thus say the Lord on that
[34:14] God wants us small to protect
[34:16] us um and we received that um but let's
[34:19] remember them and then you know we'll
[34:21] finish that abominations Bible study
[34:23] children on Sunday night we started that
[34:25] we'll finish that on Sunday night it's
[34:26] nice to go through those scriptures and
[34:28] I think if not I'm not mistaken there
[34:29] was about 14 or 15 more Abominations
[34:31] that carry over to the New Testament so
[34:33] we see how God's moral law continues
[34:35] into the New Testament by God's grace so
[34:39] Romans 9 13 and
[34:41] 14 if you got it say Amen let's read
[34:44] both 13 and 14 we can read that together
[34:46] let's begin 1 2 3 as it is written Jacob
[34:50] have I loved but Esau have I hated what
[34:54] shall we say then is there
[34:57] unrighteousness with God God forbid amen
[35:01] may God add His blessings to rema's word
[35:02] you can be seated praise God hallelujah
[35:05] so we'll try to I like if I can to
[35:07] finish this chapter tonight I don't know
[35:09] if that's possible but I told my wife or
[35:11] my wife and I were talking and she's
[35:12] going to give me a a wave at 45 minutes
[35:14] okay H so we'll see how that goes I just
[35:17] set a 45 minute timer so we'll see how
[35:20] that goes by God's grace and uh just
[35:22] when the holy spirit's here you know
[35:23] like a couple weeks ago I preached two
[35:25] hours and it felt like five minutes you
[35:26] know and every everybody's polling and
[35:27] enjoying the word of God and dancing
[35:29] before church and it's all good dance
[35:32] before after during you Just Dance any
[35:33] time Hallelujah if it's the season of
[35:35] Dance Let's Dance because there's coming
[35:36] seasons of mour likely right can't have
[35:39] seasons of Dancing forever so let's
[35:41] enjoy it while we got it by God's grace
[35:43] so we're in the fifth part here of uh
[35:45] the book of Romans we we began with the
[35:47] introduction then the whole world is
[35:48] guilty before God we moved into
[35:50] justification by faith as a solution for
[35:52] all of our guilt God justifies Us by
[35:55] taking on all of our sin sin on Christ
[35:58] and then we looked in the believer's
[36:00] walk in the Holy Spirit and the final
[36:02] result of the Gospel blessing was uh
[36:05] finished at the end of chapter 8 from
[36:07] the book of Romans then last week we
[36:09] began in Romans 9:1 and now we're
[36:11] looking at this latest section God's
[36:14] promises to Israel but I love how Paul
[36:16] brings in the Gentile position in here
[36:18] as well and if you if you if you want
[36:20] more on Israel remember I wrote a whole
[36:22] chapter on that in my uh 12 New
[36:23] Testament mystery book showing how God
[36:26] called them you know God started the
[36:28] nation through Abraham uh there was no
[36:30] Jew and Gentile at that time right uh
[36:33] and so God created the Jews through
[36:34] Abraham Hallelujah and he was an
[36:37] idolator God called an idolator and
[36:38] formed and taught him the the Living God
[36:41] a prophet uh nonetheless Abraham saw
[36:43] visions and talk to God formed a nation
[36:45] out of him and then God said I married
[36:48] this nation right but then they played
[36:50] the haret on him too many times and they
[36:52] they turned down his Messiah so he
[36:54] blinded them and he took you and I and
[36:56] he makes us his wife hallelujah what a
[36:59] story amen hallelujah he makes us the
[37:02] bride of Christ now will he bring back
[37:03] Israel yes Paul said he cut off the
[37:06] branch of the Holy branch of Israel that
[37:08] he might Graft in the Gentile but
[37:10] there's going to come a time once he's
[37:11] got all the fruits from the Gentile
[37:12] Branch he's going to cut that Branch off
[37:14] he's going to graft Israel back in and
[37:15] then the Bible said when the 144,000 are
[37:18] filled with the Holy Ghost they first
[37:19] fruits unto God see so they're the first
[37:22] fruits they're the fruits that come out
[37:23] of this Branch that's now been grafted
[37:26] back into to the holy tree Hallelujah
[37:28] but Church let's enjoy let's pull on
[37:30] let's pull on the vine while we're
[37:32] connected to Christ amen Hal let's enjoy
[37:34] the blessings of God Amen that's what we
[37:37] live by the Life of Christ Hallelujah
[37:39] that's what you and I live by Hallelujah
[37:40] by the grace of God so there's a whole
[37:42] chapter on that is chapter two of that
[37:44] book there by God's grace brother BR
[37:46] preached course many sermons on Israel
[37:48] you know Daniel 70 weeks and lots of
[37:50] Israel uh in 1953 he preached a whole
[37:53] series on Israel a beautiful series
[37:55] there by the grace of the Lord taught us
[37:56] many Bible truths now um and while I was
[38:00] on that you know I just wanted to share
[38:01] this you know since brother Rod's here
[38:03] and you we got some listeners there and
[38:04] the young people I just want to go over
[38:06] again why we believe brother Brandon was
[38:07] a prophet you know brother Bram
[38:09] fulfilled at least six verses that
[38:11] prophesied about him you know Malachi 45
[38:13] and 6 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10:7 Matthew
[38:17] 17:11 acts 3:20 and 21 there's five
[38:20] right there I always leave out one more
[38:21] oh Amos 3:7 Hallelujah at least six
[38:25] verses prophesied to the Ministry of
[38:26] brother brandham and then one of the
[38:28] main things he did was reveal the Seven
[38:30] Seals to us and once the Seven Seals
[38:33] were open then all the other Mysteries
[38:35] could be finished Hallelujah because
[38:37] there were there was sealed up it was
[38:39] the book of redemption that was sealed
[38:41] up but now it was open Hallelujah and
[38:43] once that book is open Christ opens it
[38:45] he sends down the Revelation he sends it
[38:47] down in Revelation 10 the open book
[38:49] comes down to earth and God has brother
[38:51] Ram prophesy again and when brother
[38:54] preached those Seven Seals it was the
[38:55] seven thund Thunders uttering their
[38:57] voices because a thunder is a voice of
[38:59] God and after each time brother Ram
[39:01] preached a seal he said that's thus
[39:02] sayith the Lord amen hallelujah praise
[39:04] God and that's what that's what the
[39:06] voice of God is it's a thunder
[39:07] Hallelujah and so brother Bram gave us
[39:10] the Seven Seals with thus sayith the
[39:12] Lord and that led to these other
[39:14] Mysteries there's 12 New Testament
[39:15] Mysteries doctrines that are called
[39:17] Mysteries and brother bam gave us the
[39:18] revelations on those that's what I wrote
[39:20] the book on there by God's grace and six
[39:23] of those have thus sayith the Lord so we
[39:25] know the other ones will be right as
[39:26] well well and then brother B gave us
[39:28] also He restored eight of Paul's
[39:30] doctrines that the church is lost eight
[39:32] of those were restored with us sayith
[39:34] the Lord so see this emphasis he's got
[39:36] thus sayith the Lord just like Jeremiah
[39:38] had it just like Ezekiel had it right
[39:40] and most preachers today don't have it
[39:43] right even even me I'm not a pastor I'm
[39:45] not a prophet so I don't give thus
[39:47] sayith the Lords right very few people
[39:49] do so the very fact he spoke with thus
[39:51] sayith the Lord so accurately so many
[39:53] times it proves one more proof he's a
[39:55] prophet of God God hallelujah because
[39:57] like like we said before TD Jake don't
[39:59] say thus sayith the Lord Joe OS sure
[40:01] don't say thus sayith the Lord you know
[40:02] all these other men we can name I
[40:04] respect John MacArthur a lot I I respect
[40:06] some of the work John Piper's done but
[40:08] none of them speak with thus sayith the
[40:09] Lord some of them if they're faithful
[40:11] they have their teachings and they have
[40:13] their their calling of God and some of
[40:14] them have been a blessing to me now some
[40:16] of them haven't some of them are really
[40:17] off the word of God but I'm just
[40:19] speaking in general but brother Ram was
[40:21] the only one that spoke with thus sayith
[40:23] the Lord and it had so many vindications
[40:25] Hallelujah
[40:26] and then um I made a video about this
[40:29] too brother raham has at least six thus
[40:30] sayith the Lord prophecies for told
[40:32] about the future six of them are
[40:34] fulfilled I mentioned one last week with
[40:36] the rock and roll that was one of them
[40:38] now there's also 11 more that are to
[40:40] come that I found now that's just in my
[40:41] humble study I'm not a full-time Pastor
[40:44] I wish I could spend eight hours a day
[40:45] studying but I can't I got to go to work
[40:47] and feed my family but that's again it's
[40:49] God's will amen Paul was a Tent Maker
[40:51] amen if he could do it I can do it by
[40:53] God's grace but then I found last just
[40:56] just just few months ago I found this
[40:57] over 110 doctrines that brother Ram
[41:01] restored that the denominations got
[41:03] wrong and we're not slamming the people
[41:05] but we're slamming the devil that
[41:07] creates all those false doctrines it's
[41:10] the devil that makes a denomination said
[41:11] we're only going this far we won't
[41:13] accept anymore that's a devil that does
[41:15] that because the Bible said we cannot
[41:16] limit the Holy One of Israel praise God
[41:19] that's why brother Ram said our Creed
[41:20] book is the Bible amen hallelujah so
[41:23] we're not going to add to the Bible
[41:25] we're not going to take away from the
[41:26] Bible amen all of our Creeds and bylaws
[41:28] right in the word of God hallelujah but
[41:31] I found at least 110 and remember um and
[41:35] remember also brother had so many
[41:37] Supernatural healings testimonies
[41:40] discernments uh the first time he even
[41:41] heard his voice preach I just wept I was
[41:43] a sinner brother Rod I I was I was
[41:45] listening to brother Brandon with
[41:46] headphones on I was playing
[41:48] Nintendo Right video games and I'm
[41:51] chewing tobacco I'm chewing tobacco and
[41:55] all I do is start crying
[41:56] I I said I never I never heard a man
[41:58] preach like this and I turned off the
[41:59] Nintendo and I I said God forgive me I
[42:01] took out my chew I never heard a man and
[42:04] I've lived in church I was raised in
[42:05] Assembly of God Church I thank God for
[42:07] the Assembly of God Church I was raised
[42:08] in they were very sweet people but I
[42:10] never heard a man preach like that
[42:12] because that's a prophet of God
[42:13] hallelujah
[42:15] amen and uh you know you can go on
[42:17] YouTube and you can or whatever you can
[42:19] find so many testimonies we we just read
[42:20] a book with 39 testimonies people that
[42:23] knew brother R personally and each one
[42:25] of them were so impressed ressed by his
[42:26] Godly Christian character and each of
[42:28] them knew he was a prophet of God
[42:30] without even knowing what we know all
[42:32] they did just watch his ministry and
[42:33] they knew this man's a prophet he would
[42:35] answer all their questions before they
[42:37] would even ask them sometimes he would
[42:38] interpret their dreams he would tell
[42:40] them things to come like the one the the
[42:42] one uh woman he said he said uh you're
[42:44] going to meet your W you're going to uh
[42:46] your husband's going to be uh you're
[42:48] going to meet your husband out west and
[42:50] he said make sure you have frozen steaks
[42:52] in your your freezer because that's how
[42:54] you're going to know it's him you're
[42:55] going to cook him a steak with me and it
[42:58] happened a few years later and she
[42:59] totally forgot about it she was just out
[43:01] she went in there she she got the frozen
[43:03] steaks out cooked them and after that
[43:05] you know he was interested in her and
[43:06] then realized later okay brother R saw a
[43:09] vision of
[43:10] it now she said I and she said I always
[43:12] keep frozen steaks as a memorial in my
[43:15] freezer I guess when you want one
[43:16] they're nice to have aren't
[43:18] they but just things like that and it's
[43:20] on I we we've gone through many on tape
[43:22] as well I I met two people that knew
[43:24] brother brandom and brother BR did that
[43:26] to both of them he told them things that
[43:28] come to pass foretold uh foretold their
[43:30] healings foretold answer their questions
[43:32] without them asking the questions a true
[43:35] man of God and of course there was fruit
[43:37] to his Godly life and Ministry now today
[43:40] since 2012 so yes now it's been 12 years
[43:43] Satan has raised up a lot of accusers
[43:44] against brother brandom because all
[43:46] these Saints are dying right and there's
[43:48] less
[43:50] testimonies right but uh just because
[43:54] some people fell away or some people
[43:55] that new brother
[43:56] don't serve God that's not brother
[43:58] bram's fault brother Bram served God and
[44:00] it's just like Jesus he had 71 preachers
[44:03] leave him right so out of the majority
[44:06] of his preachers the majority left him
[44:09] very few stayed the same thing's true
[44:10] with brother Brandon same thing true
[44:11] with with Martin Luther Martin Luther
[44:13] said I hope 10 of 10% of my converts
[44:15] have stayed true to the my message I
[44:18] found that in history last year brother
[44:19] I couldn't believe it he was just hoping
[44:21] he was hoping I can keep 10% of what the
[44:24] Lord has given me
[44:26] just that's how it is in every age right
[44:28] 71 walked away from Jesus 90% walked
[44:31] away from Martin Luther how many walked
[44:33] away from Brother braham's Bible
[44:34] teaching now it's the Bible teaching but
[44:36] how do we know we're true followers
[44:38] because we believe the Bible hallelujah
[44:40] we're staying with the word of God and
[44:42] then in that also in that chapter 13 in
[44:44] that uh book The 12 New Testament
[44:46] Ministries I show five characteristics
[44:48] brother had that was exactly the same as
[44:50] Elijah he prophesied with thus sayith
[44:53] the Lord like Elijah
[44:54] did uh he was against immoral women he
[44:57] condemned the immoral women of the day
[44:59] like Jezebel right brother ramam
[45:00] condemned uh Jackie Kennedy how she cut
[45:03] her hair wore makeup and wore high heels
[45:06] and wore sexy clothes brother Bram
[45:08] condemned that while she was alive
[45:09] brother Marilyn Monroe he condemned all
[45:12] them women all their immorality because
[45:14] he had thus sayith the Lord he is a
[45:16] prophet of God he's a man of the
[45:18] Wilderness uh there's numerous other oh
[45:19] he turned the hearts of the fathers to
[45:21] the children he turned us back he turned
[45:23] our hearts back to the apostolic fathers
[45:25] right cuz some of our fathers didn't
[45:27] serve God but we got a father Hallelujah
[45:29] we got fathers in the faith St Paul and
[45:31] St Peter Hallelujah and God turned us
[45:34] back to those fathers Hallelujah because
[45:36] that's what really matters Hallelujah
[45:38] Paul said you have not many fathers in
[45:40] the faith he said you have thousands of
[45:41] instructors but not many fathers amen so
[45:44] I just thought I'd share that briefly
[45:46] now also in this chapter Romans nine
[45:48] Paul gave us the order of
[45:50] predestination the first order is God
[45:53] has for knowledge of what you'll choose
[45:55] we're going to look at that a little bit
[45:55] more more tonight first he has four
[45:57] knowledge and that's why he could choose
[45:59] you in his mind before the foundation of
[46:01] the world remember we read that last
[46:02] week Ephesians 1:4 once he has his for
[46:05] knowledge then the Bible said Paul said
[46:07] he predestines you and as I said earlier
[46:09] acts 17 says he determines even the
[46:11] places you're going to live remember in
[46:14] and I read this a few weeks ago in Psalm
[46:16] 139 David said you have so many thoughts
[46:19] in me he said I can't even count the
[46:20] number of them think about all the
[46:22] thoughts that went just into the your
[46:24] your the number of hairs on your head
[46:26] right or the all the steps in life you
[46:28] would take the jobs the people you'd
[46:30] meet uh how many breaths you would take
[46:31] in every day right how many times you'd
[46:34] be sick and God would heal you amen all
[46:36] these details about your life God had
[46:38] all this written down and David said I
[46:40] can't even number all the thoughts you
[46:41] have towards me oh my Hallelujah I'm
[46:44] talking about a God who loves you
[46:46] Hallelujah that's why I singing those
[46:48] songs earlier I'm a friend of God
[46:50] hallelujah amen you're a friend of God
[46:52] God loves us hallelujah he predestinated
[46:55] Our Lives lives we couldn't live any
[46:56] other time we had to live now praise God
[46:59] and then after he predestinated you then
[47:00] he called you which means elected you he
[47:03] elected you he called you and then once
[47:06] you heard that calling then he justified
[47:08] you which we all stand Justified here
[47:10] tonight am declared righteous as you
[47:14] would ha as you would like to be the
[47:15] definition is so you and I we want to be
[47:18] 100% righteous not 99 give me
[47:21] 100% I want to be fully righteous and
[47:24] that's what we're that's what we're
[47:25] given justification is the righteousness
[47:28] that you wish to be Hallelujah if I went
[47:31] to a court and someone accused me I
[47:33] don't want to as we're talking about
[47:34] court if someone went to court I
[47:36] wouldn't wouldn't be uh forgiven of of
[47:38] 99 charges if there's a 100 I want to be
[47:40] forgiven of all 100 praise God and
[47:42] that's what Jesus did for us Jesus took
[47:44] all of our charges on him Hallelujah
[47:47] that we have no charges amen and the
[47:50] Bible said and nobody can come around
[47:51] and lay anything to our account praise
[47:54] God because it's God that justifies us
[47:56] hallelujah it's not a man it's not your
[47:58] mom it's not your brother it's not your
[48:00] your pastor or me it's not anybody it's
[48:03] God who declares you righteous am amen
[48:06] hallelujah and then this last step one
[48:08] day one glorious day brother Austin
[48:10] we'll get that last step
[48:12] glorification amen we'll get our
[48:14] glorified bodies Hallelujah a body that
[48:17] can eat and drink and travel faster than
[48:19] a thought like Jesus could walk through
[48:21] walls amen we'll get a body like that
[48:23] that's that final step Hallelujah Paul
[48:25] says that's the finality of adoption
[48:28] hallelujah amen we have the earnest now
[48:31] we have the Holy Ghost in our soul now
[48:33] that's the earnest of of of The
[48:36] Inheritance that's the down payment
[48:38] Hallelujah and because we got the down
[48:40] payment the rest is coming Hallelujah
[48:44] the glorification is coming so we're
[48:46] thankful for that by God's grace now we
[48:49] saw last week God said I love Jacob but
[48:51] Esau have I hated and I I found through
[48:53] studying the scripture that it seems
[48:55] seems like uh it's not that God hated
[48:58] Esau because we see many scriptures God
[49:00] doesn't Delight when Sinners die in fact
[49:02] I found another one I was listening here
[49:04] 2 Peter 3:9 I'm going to try to read
[49:06] that by God's grace second Peter 3:9 I
[49:11] just came to my mind here the Lord is
[49:13] not slack concerning his promise now
[49:15] sometimes we have trouble waiting right
[49:17] but let's remember God's not late amen
[49:20] God's not
[49:21] lazy God's not behind God's right on
[49:24] schedule amen
[49:26] he's not slack now sometimes we're like
[49:28] God where are you at right and we're all
[49:29] guilty of it and then we come to church
[49:31] we get corrected by God's grace or we
[49:33] turn turn on a song or whatever repent
[49:36] however it works but God's not slack as
[49:38] some men count slackness but he's
[49:40] longsuffering to usw see he's
[49:42] longsuffering with you and I with me and
[49:45] you he's very patient with us he suffers
[49:48] long with our
[49:49] mistakes our attitudes and he's not
[49:52] willing that any should perish amen so
[49:55] it's plain God didn't want to see Esau
[49:58] in that condition God didn't want to see
[50:00] judas's scarat like that but the Bible's
[50:03] plain and Peter should know if anybody
[50:05] should know God's longsuffering it's
[50:06] Peter
[50:07] Hallelujah who denied Christ three times
[50:10] after all Jesus had done for him he
[50:11] denied him three C denied him three
[50:13] times as Christ Messiah but he tells us
[50:16] God is longsuffering and God is not
[50:18] willing that any should
[50:20] perish but Jesus tells us the reason
[50:23] they will in John 3 is because they love
[50:25] dark Darkness more than light church I
[50:27] hope you're in a spot where you can look
[50:28] at your life and say I love the word of
[50:30] God way more than anything else
[50:32] Hallelujah I used to love Darkness but I
[50:34] do not love Darkness I Love The Gospel
[50:37] Light
[50:38] hallelujah amen I love the light more
[50:41] than anything else Hallelujah and church
[50:44] I'll say like
[50:45] this you know when brother Ben was
[50:47] preaching on the eyes you know if we're
[50:48] not careful church when we see something
[50:50] evil on our phones or screens or
[50:52] anything's Billboards we got to live so
[50:54] close to God that it shakes us when we
[50:56] see something
[50:58] sinful right we all had that at some
[51:01] point that's called your first love
[51:04] right you heard something you're like oh
[51:05] or you saw but then after a while if
[51:07] we're not careful it doesn't hurt us
[51:09] anymore but Jesus said you can return to
[51:12] your first love how many you believe
[51:14] that you do the first works and that's
[51:16] what I found in my life because that was
[51:18] such a wonderful sermon that was if you
[51:19] guys didn't listen to that one that was
[51:21] powerful and afterwards we dedicated our
[51:23] devices to Jesus so now this is Jesus's
[51:28] Hallelujah I never done that before I
[51:30] was like I was oblivious to that what a
[51:32] what a wonderful thing to do and it's
[51:34] been a a blessing this week Hallelujah
[51:36] now most weeks it is you know but we all
[51:38] struggle at times but just such a such a
[51:40] reminder that sin should shock us uh sh
[51:44] sin uh should should make us upset amen
[51:48] right we've all sighed and cried for
[51:49] Abominations we we've been so sad with
[51:51] sin sometimes but we we got to keep that
[51:53] sacredness we got to keep that hope Hess
[51:55] in our lives Hallelujah we got to find a
[51:57] way to get it back hallelujah amen that
[52:00] was a great reminder I sure appreciate
[52:01] the Holy Spirit uh preaching that that
[52:03] was truly a message from God I believe
[52:06] that like I said you know I think when
[52:08] brother Dennis was here I was afterwards
[52:09] I got back I said we heard from Heaven
[52:11] brother Ben comes we heard from Heaven I
[52:12] hope we hear from Heaven tonight
[52:14] Hallelujah I hope you're hearing from
[52:15] Heaven tonight by God's grace don't
[52:17] leave me out Lord God don't leave me out
[52:19] speak through me your humble servant
[52:21] mine but we
[52:23] saw why God was so against
[52:27] Esau God was merciful to Esau but the
[52:30] history the Jewish history said on that
[52:32] day that he turned down his Birthright
[52:34] he did five evil things he took a virgin
[52:37] that was betro of another man this what
[52:39] the Jews say that's why the Bible called
[52:41] him a fornicator in Hebrews 12 on the
[52:44] same day he killed a
[52:46] person right because he couldn't get any
[52:48] he couldn't get any
[52:50] animals uh now I don't know about these
[52:52] next ones but he said the the Jewish
[52:54] writing said that he denied the
[52:55] resurrection of the
[52:56] Dead uh he despised his birth right he
[52:59] desired his father's death and then he s
[53:02] sought to slay his brother so there's an
[53:04] overlap in there maybe I got my numbers
[53:05] wrong but we can see all that happen on
[53:07] the same day right and this is why God
[53:11] would didn't hate Esau but it it was
[53:13] just hyperbole for meaning God's going
[53:15] to favor
[53:17] Jacob Hallelujah so God Favored Jacob
[53:21] now I was looking again you know this
[53:23] week just thinking about Jacob and Esau
[53:25] again and really Jacob did of course
[53:27] live a more righteous life than
[53:30] Esau you know Esau we know about him uh
[53:33] we know the history of him Church the
[53:35] history is he he moved away he married
[53:37] two uh uh Canaanite women and then he
[53:39] married uh an Israelite women to kind of
[53:42] make his parents uh not so mad at him
[53:45] but the damage was
[53:47] done he grew to be a wealthy man now the
[53:50] wonderful thing is he got peace with his
[53:51] brother at the end of his life he got
[53:53] delivered from that murderous spirit
[53:55] amen
[53:56] right but then his descendants they
[53:59] didn't have that same attitude toward
[54:01] Israel trace it all through Moses and
[54:03] Joshua it was Israel against
[54:06] Israel against
[54:07] all the way down to David and
[54:10] there was prophecy I'm not I can preach
[54:12] a whole sermon on this but there's
[54:14] prophecy after prophecy in Ezekiel and
[54:15] different prophets against Edom that
[54:18] their their land would come to
[54:19] Desolation church do you know to this
[54:21] day this group of people the
[54:24] Esau's are perished off the
[54:27] Earth and there's no more L their
[54:30] language is gone their land is is is
[54:34] uninhabitable right because God said I'm
[54:36] gonna favor Jacob and I'm gonna go
[54:38] against I'm not going to favor Esau why
[54:40] because Esau despised the birthright
[54:43] right he got those evil spirits on him
[54:46] but Jacob loved the birthright amen
[54:49] Jacob Jacob was he was he he was he was
[54:53] a a supplanter at first she would
[54:55] deceive her at first but God was looking
[54:57] past all that mire God was looking down
[55:00] deep into his life amen hallelujah
[55:03] hallelujah those sins of his youth it
[55:06] didn't throw God off brother Austin you
[55:08] and I the sins of our youth it didn't
[55:10] throw God off God knew there was
[55:11] something inside of us hallelujah amen
[55:14] God predestinated our lives amen
[55:17] hallelujah just like Jacob amen and when
[55:20] Jacob's Hard Times came what'd he do he
[55:22] called out to God Amen right when it
[55:25] came down to it he said I want the
[55:27] birthright I want the Messiah to come
[55:29] out of my family that's what he's
[55:30] basically
[55:31] saying I want the Messiah I'll be a
[55:34] religious leader if you don't want to be
[55:35] the religious leader I'll be it and God
[55:39] thought so much of Jacob he said Jacob
[55:42] he said I love you I'm going to name a
[55:44] nation after
[55:45] you I'm GNA give you 12 sons not two I'm
[55:49] glad for two though I I'll take two two
[55:51] is better than none you know or one I'll
[55:54] take whatever God gives us but he said
[55:56] I'm going to give you 12 sons and I'm
[55:58] going to call the entire people after
[56:00] your name Israel Hallelujah I'm going to
[56:03] change your name to show you that you're
[56:05] a changed person hallelujah amen this is
[56:09] why God loved
[56:11] Jacob and Jacob we sing that song Jacob
[56:14] would not be
[56:17] denied he refused to go into to the
[56:20] meeting with his brother in fear so I'll
[56:23] say like this he was willing to pray all
[56:25] night and the church said he wrestled
[56:28] all night with an angel you've got to
[56:30] change me I've got to be like you I've
[56:32] got to be a new man I need God's favor
[56:35] and that's why God loved Jacob
[56:37] hallelujah amen how many wrestled it out
[56:39] with God before
[56:41] amen
[56:43] hallelujah that's that's what God loves
[56:46] God loves a man or a woman like Hannah
[56:48] hallelujah how she wrestled It Out With
[56:50] God all the Mary wrestled Out With God
[56:53] all these Believers wrest out with God
[56:56] I'm not taking no for an answer I got to
[56:58] have God's blessing in my life
[57:00] hallelujah amen and Esau's like I'll
[57:02] sell it away for red red pottage you
[57:05] know I'll sell it away for one meal and
[57:09] then he sought it carefully with tears
[57:11] and God said no it's done because God
[57:13] still knew what Esau would do he'd go
[57:15] marry those women and do all these
[57:17] things all these evil
[57:20] things so see what was Jacob he was a
[57:24] man that loved the Messiah he was a
[57:26] tithe payer too he said Lord whatever
[57:28] you give me I'm giving you a tenth of
[57:31] everything like his granddaddy Abraham
[57:35] Hallelujah he's a friend of God he was
[57:38] desperate to be changed
[57:41] Hallelujah brother Braham said that he
[57:44] said Jacob stayed there until the
[57:46] blessing came when he wrestled with God
[57:48] and God changed his name from deceiver
[57:50] brother man said to a prince with God
[57:52] even the nation was called by his name
[57:56] because he said God Chang
[57:58] me I don't want to deceive people I
[58:01] don't want to hurt anybody anymore or
[58:03] you pray a prayer like that God's going
[58:05] to change your name Hallelujah God's
[58:07] going to bless you God's going to give
[58:09] you Victory Hallelujah if we become
[58:11] desperate with God and we run a walk in
[58:13] integrity and walk in the Holy Spirit
[58:15] you know God's going to bless you
[58:17] Hallelujah I've never seen it fail
[58:20] Hallelujah that's why we see God
[58:21] blessing our our friends now you know
[58:24] Hallelujah
[58:26] because you're you're you're desperate
[58:27] you're living in Integrity Hallelujah
[58:29] loving God serving God the same thing
[58:30] happened to me praise God Amen
[58:34] Hallelujah that's right get sincere with
[58:36] God and God will get down to business
[58:38] with us hallelujah but said even the
[58:41] nation was called by his name yes sir
[58:42] what was it the result was because he
[58:44] got desperate about the thing where did
[58:47] Esa Esau got desperate one time but it
[58:49] wasn't he said it was he saw it
[58:50] carefully with tears but God still
[58:52] denied him now think about that the rest
[58:53] of his life he didn't bother anymore
[58:55] asking God about
[58:56] it right see church that's why we don't
[58:58] stop praying if we just pray one time
[59:00] we're not going to stop if God don't
[59:01] answer we're going to keep praying Jesus
[59:04] said there was going to be a woman
[59:05] that's knocking all the time uh Mr judge
[59:07] sir I'm on your hands brother ra said
[59:09] keep knocking God I'm on your hands God
[59:12] I need you answer my prayer I I believe
[59:15] God here I am I'm still waiting
[59:17] hallelujah it's 2024 I'm still knocking
[59:21] Hallelujah right church but Esau does it
[59:24] one time God looked through that God saw
[59:26] that's not really sincere I want a man
[59:28] like Jacob who loved me and served me
[59:30] and he devote his whole life to me he he
[59:33] teach his children the ways of the Lord
[59:36] hallelujah God God thought so much of
[59:38] him he showed him a ladder up to heaven
[59:40] and that lad was the type of Christ the
[59:42] way to get to heaven he's the way the
[59:45] truth and the life
[59:47] hallelujah oh said you got to get
[59:50] desperate until you get the
[59:51] Assurance he said that's what Jacob did
[59:54] he got in desperation till he got the
[59:57] assurance and church that's how it is
[59:58] for every situation like I told you with
[1:00:00] Brother Ray giving that testimony I was
[1:00:02] in desperation God why is this why that
[1:00:04] and I got in desperation until then God
[1:00:06] gives me the assurance and now I can
[1:00:08] live with peace in my heart I can live
[1:00:11] with joy and happiness because I got
[1:00:13] desperate and God gave me
[1:00:16] Assurance Blessed assurance Jesus Is
[1:00:18] Mine amen
[1:00:21] hallelujah now let's go back to Romans 9
[1:00:23] that's my introduction Hallelujah
[1:00:25] Romans
[1:00:31] 9:13 as is written Jacob have I loved
[1:00:33] but Esau have I hated what shall we say
[1:00:35] then is there unrighteousness with God
[1:00:37] God
[1:00:38] forbid so was God unrighteous did God uh
[1:00:42] do the wrong thing with Esau
[1:00:44] no you can you can line up uh Esau's
[1:00:47] good deeds and Jacob's good deeds and
[1:00:49] Jacob way outnumbers
[1:00:53] them Samuel told Saul God's going to
[1:00:56] give the kingdom to a a Believer more
[1:00:58] righteous than
[1:01:00] you better than
[1:01:02] you see the Bride of Jesus Christ loves
[1:01:05] Jesus and keeps his
[1:01:07] commands we're not saved by works but we
[1:01:10] were created for Works Hallelujah that's
[1:01:13] what I was made for that's what you were
[1:01:15] born for you were born to do something a
[1:01:18] work for God Almighty
[1:01:21] hallelujah amen that's where people some
[1:01:24] with this chapter they think well oh
[1:01:27] Jacob never had any works you haven't
[1:01:28] read your Bible lately Jacob had a lot
[1:01:31] of Godly Works amen he's a real man of
[1:01:35] God took him some years to get over his
[1:01:37] trials but it takes you to some years to
[1:01:39] get over your trials
[1:01:40] too right you're not Mr Goody Two Shoes
[1:01:43] or Mrs goody two shoes and never sined a
[1:01:45] day in your life never never did despite
[1:01:47] the grace of God ever come on verse 15
[1:01:51] for he said to Moses I have mercy on
[1:01:53] whom I have mercy and I have compassion
[1:01:55] on whom I will have
[1:01:58] compassion now look God showed
[1:02:00] compassion on Cain he didn't kill him at
[1:02:02] the beginning right but yet God had aen
[1:02:05] and his acces slain God had Kora and his
[1:02:09] accomp accomplishes slain ananas and saf
[1:02:13] in each case God was just and fair in
[1:02:16] what he
[1:02:18] did none of them none of them uh that
[1:02:20] were that God took their lives are going
[1:02:22] to say well God you weren't fair to me
[1:02:23] no God said I am righteous I had mercy
[1:02:27] well on whom I had mercy I had
[1:02:28] compassion on who I had compassion I did
[1:02:31] that which was right who's going to tell
[1:02:33] God to his face he judged it wrong you
[1:02:35] won't even get out of your line lips
[1:02:37] right talking about Kora Kan and a aan
[1:02:41] ananis and zra couldn't even utter
[1:02:43] something like that in the presence of
[1:02:45] God verse 16 so then it is not of him
[1:02:48] that willth nor of him that runneth but
[1:02:50] of God that showeth Mercy Hallelujah so
[1:02:53] of course no notice Paul is talking
[1:02:55] about Jacob so when he's talking about
[1:02:56] Jacob it's not Israel right it's not the
[1:02:58] he's talking about the pre the the the
[1:03:00] beginning of Jacob's life right Jacob's
[1:03:03] the beginning of his life didn't look
[1:03:04] very
[1:03:05] good right and God said it was God
[1:03:08] showed Mercy to Jacob God showed him
[1:03:11] Mercy because God knew what Jacob would
[1:03:13] ultimately
[1:03:14] desire that's right verse 17 for the
[1:03:17] scripture sayith unto Pharaoh even for
[1:03:19] the same purpose have I raised thee up
[1:03:22] that I might show my power in thee and
[1:03:24] that my name might be declared
[1:03:26] throughout all the Earth we all know the
[1:03:28] Bible said God hardened Pharaoh's
[1:03:31] heart right but God was righteous in
[1:03:33] doing
[1:03:34] it right because as soon as his as soon
[1:03:38] as Pharaoh's heart gets softened what's
[1:03:40] he do he turns around and say no even
[1:03:41] though they're out there I'm gonna go
[1:03:42] kill him I'm gonna go get I'm gonna go
[1:03:44] back on my word God knew that God knew
[1:03:48] he couldn't keep his word right God knew
[1:03:50] he was a murderer at his heart so God
[1:03:53] knew he was a vessel Of Dishonor God
[1:03:56] knew the list of his wrongs was really
[1:03:59] long Hallelujah and Moses's wrongs were
[1:04:02] much shorter Hallelujah although he had
[1:04:05] some
[1:04:05] wrongs murderer glor glorifying himself
[1:04:09] kept him out of the promised land right
[1:04:11] never circumcised his boys the angel was
[1:04:13] going to kill him but zapor saved him
[1:04:15] brother R said God gave him a wife that
[1:04:17] would save his life amen any other
[1:04:19] brothers feel like your wife has saved
[1:04:20] your life my wife has physically saved
[1:04:21] my life a couple times Hallelujah
[1:04:26] amen it's God it's God's work verse 17
[1:04:30] it was God's purpose I raised thee up
[1:04:33] that I might show my power in thee and
[1:04:34] that my name might be declared through
[1:04:36] all the
[1:04:37] Earth so whose name was were people
[1:04:39] afraid of after uh The Exodus was it
[1:04:42] Pharaoh or
[1:04:43] Jehovah Jehovah's name was to be feared
[1:04:47] amen remember when Joshua got there all
[1:04:49] the nations are like who God is this
[1:04:52] what what kind of God is this they all h
[1:04:54] about him and Rahab said I want to part
[1:04:56] with the I want to serve this God
[1:04:59] hallelujah cuz Faith comes by hearing
[1:05:01] see hearing about this this Mighty God
[1:05:05] it made all the other people in Jericho
[1:05:07] go against God but it made the real
[1:05:09] believer Rahab believe in God hallelujah
[1:05:12] so see any believer today when you hear
[1:05:14] the judgments of God or you know the
[1:05:15] tribulation coming if you're a true
[1:05:17] believer that will humble you and you'll
[1:05:19] try to gain God's favor through
[1:05:21] repentance hallelujah amen
[1:05:24] amen Verse 18 therefore he hath hath he
[1:05:28] Mercy on whom he have mercy and whom he
[1:05:31] will he hardeneth so see God didn't have
[1:05:34] mercy on Esau when he repented because
[1:05:36] God knew the rest of his life he would
[1:05:37] just live
[1:05:38] rich and he really wouldn't desire the
[1:05:41] things of God again he keep all those
[1:05:43] wives he should not have get you know
[1:05:45] God knew that right God had mercy on
[1:05:48] Jacob because God knew Jacob was a real
[1:05:50] man remember Jacob even said whoever
[1:05:52] stole that Idol is a curse on them now
[1:05:55] look at that what a
[1:05:56] Believer I don't want any curses in my
[1:05:58] house what a testimony that
[1:06:00] is I don't want any curses death penalty
[1:06:03] on anybody who brings an idol in my
[1:06:05] house now that's a strict word that's
[1:06:07] how much you love
[1:06:08] God then could follow when God said when
[1:06:11] God said now leave labben leave your
[1:06:13] father-in-law and your mother-in-law
[1:06:14] right leave your family and go back to
[1:06:16] where you were born he left many of us
[1:06:19] maybe maybe maybe some people not us
[1:06:22] here but maybe people listening or
[1:06:23] Beyond they couldn't leave their family
[1:06:25] if God asked them to because they love
[1:06:28] their family more than God but Jacob was
[1:06:30] willing to leave some of family members
[1:06:32] Hallelujah I'm not talking about a
[1:06:34] five-minute Drive in a in a air
[1:06:36] conditioned uh
[1:06:38] Nissan I'm talking about a long trip in
[1:06:41] the hot sun
[1:06:43] suffering but willing to do the will of
[1:06:45] God because he had a bethl amen
[1:06:47] hallelujah he's going back to bethl
[1:06:48] Hallelujah where it'd be in the presence
[1:06:50] of God at the altar of God at the house
[1:06:52] of the Lord amen God called him back to
[1:06:54] the house of the Lord hallelujah bethl
[1:06:56] means house of the
[1:06:58] Lord God saw that so God had mercy on
[1:07:01] him because God knew Jacob's heart was
[1:07:03] to do what's right and the Bible said
[1:07:06] God's rich in
[1:07:08] Mercy so that means Esau just spurned
[1:07:10] all that richness think about all that
[1:07:12] Mercy was available but Esau spurned it
[1:07:15] just for a life living in riches and
[1:07:17] whatever Pleasures that he had in his
[1:07:18] life bitterness right fornicator the
[1:07:21] Bible said bitter
[1:07:24] but here Jacob gets God's mercy because
[1:07:27] Jacob had a soft heart amen Church may
[1:07:31] God help us to always have a tender
[1:07:32] heart to the things of God church if
[1:07:35] we're not enjoying song service
[1:07:36] something's wrong with our hearts if
[1:07:38] we're not enjoying the preaching of the
[1:07:40] word something is seriously wrong with
[1:07:42] our hearts it's time to get down to the
[1:07:44] altar if you don't enjoy when the guest
[1:07:46] preachers come something's wrong with
[1:07:47] your
[1:07:48] heart and say God soften my heart it's
[1:07:51] become hard somehow this world my trial
[1:07:54] my struggles my sins my iniquities it's
[1:07:56] hard in Me God soften me to your word
[1:07:59] again bring back a soft tender heart
[1:08:03] that can receive the things of
[1:08:04] God I've lost my dance bring back the
[1:08:08] dance amen hallelujah bring back uh the
[1:08:11] joy bring back the victory
[1:08:13] Hallelujah hey man yeah the joy of my
[1:08:15] salvation Hallelujah now to balance the
[1:08:17] scripture go to 2 Samuel uh 22:25 this
[1:08:21] verse has always blessed me so much and
[1:08:24] I believe it's kept us on the right side
[1:08:25] of this sovereignty of God issue right
[1:08:28] because there's some people are on the
[1:08:29] wrong side and they're on this side you
[1:08:32] know God's going to save you no matter
[1:08:33] what you do you can never spurn God's
[1:08:35] grace that's Calvinism they go way too
[1:08:37] far right but the Armenians go too far
[1:08:39] on you know it's all your it's all your
[1:08:41] works that got you saved the truth is
[1:08:43] right down the
[1:08:45] middle right like there's a brother uh
[1:08:47] used to come to this church good brother
[1:08:49] lovely brother but I invited him back to
[1:08:51] church and he said well if I'm predes to
[1:08:54] go he said if I'm pred to go in the
[1:08:56] Rapture why do I even got to come to
[1:08:58] church I said that's a real sad
[1:09:00] statement
[1:09:01] friend I said the Bible said choose you
[1:09:04] this day the Bible said make your
[1:09:05] calling election sure if you love me
[1:09:07] keep my commands so see that that that's
[1:09:09] the
[1:09:10] danger right they call Le leot and lazy
[1:09:13] boys that's what we got around the
[1:09:14] message yeah a lot of you I just want to
[1:09:16] sit home and be lazy but you came out to
[1:09:17] the house of God because you love God
[1:09:20] Amen and and they're showing this other
[1:09:22] side of sovereignty well if God already
[1:09:24] did it then there's nothing I can do
[1:09:26] about it but the Bible said stir
[1:09:28] yourself up the Bible said be a man
[1:09:30] Hallelujah for the men now quit you like
[1:09:33] man amen obey the word of God yes fight
[1:09:36] the good fight of Faith Hallelujah put
[1:09:39] the enemy to flight put on the armor of
[1:09:42] God put it on Amen drive back the enemy
[1:09:45] drive him out of your life
[1:09:47] Hallelujah make your calling election
[1:09:49] sure that's why I love how God showed me
[1:09:52] these verses so many years ago
[1:09:54] because God says because David speaks by
[1:09:58] the Holy Ghost remember David said I
[1:10:00] speak by the spirit of God hallelujah I
[1:10:03] was a sweet psalmist unto the unto the
[1:10:06] Lord so God said I'll have mercy on whom
[1:10:09] I have mercy but David gives us the
[1:10:11] other side God will be merciful to those
[1:10:13] who are
[1:10:15] merciful right so Paul gives us one side
[1:10:18] from God's view and then David gives us
[1:10:21] this other view where God is looking at
[1:10:23] how ful you've been and if you're if
[1:10:26] you're kind to God if if you're
[1:10:28] respectful to God God will respect
[1:10:31] you right so you see both sides
[1:10:33] therefore the Lord hath recompensed me
[1:10:35] according to my righteousness according
[1:10:37] to my cleanness clean cleanness in his
[1:10:39] sight with the merciful thou will show
[1:10:42] thyself merciful so people misunderstand
[1:10:45] Romans nine well God's not giving me
[1:10:48] mercy because you just don't want to no
[1:10:50] David gives us the other side you've got
[1:10:52] a choice in this
[1:10:54] you can accept God's mercy if you
[1:10:56] receive it Hallelujah if you want it
[1:10:58] Esau didn't want it he just cried about
[1:11:00] it a little bit complained about it and
[1:11:02] then he went on with his
[1:11:04] life brother Austin if there was any
[1:11:06] question in my life if I had the holy
[1:11:08] ghost or wasn't saved I would stay at
[1:11:09] this altar until it was finalized in my
[1:11:12] heart malach I'd say there I wouldn't
[1:11:15] leave I wouldn't quit I wouldn't move on
[1:11:17] with life and say wasn't for me I'd give
[1:11:19] the rest of my life to it Hallelujah
[1:11:21] that's why I preach that week after week
[1:11:23] cuz I want to make sure I want to make
[1:11:25] my calling election sure Hallelujah am
[1:11:27] so there's no questions about it like
[1:11:29] Paul said I got to beat my body in the
[1:11:31] subjection so I'm I'm sure I'm not a
[1:11:34] Cast Away
[1:11:35] am because I know you give this flesh an
[1:11:38] inch it'll take a
[1:11:39] mile is that
[1:11:41] right yeah that's
[1:11:46] right I love these verses you tie them
[1:11:48] together you got to you got to use
[1:11:50] Romans 9 and you got to use 2 Samuel
[1:11:52] 22 there's the human element of it where
[1:11:55] God is forming you and he's giving your
[1:11:58] he's giving you your free moral agency
[1:11:59] in this matter but he already knew what
[1:12:01] you would
[1:12:03] choose with the merciful thou will show
[1:12:05] thyself merciful now church we don't
[1:12:08] compromise with sin but sometimes we got
[1:12:09] to be merciful with people till they
[1:12:10] overcome their
[1:12:12] sins okay but we don't compromise with
[1:12:15] sin we want we want we want to treat
[1:12:18] others like we want to be
[1:12:19] treated praise
[1:12:22] God that's the Golden Rule and with the
[1:12:25] upright thou will show thyself upright
[1:12:27] so see if you live right God will treat
[1:12:29] you like you live right with the pure
[1:12:31] thou W show thyself
[1:12:34] pure and this this statement about blew
[1:12:36] me out of the water and with the frow
[1:12:38] word the perverse the Twisted the
[1:12:40] Crooked distorted thou will show thyself
[1:12:43] unsavory which means twisted or to
[1:12:46] wrestle so with the Twisted you're going
[1:12:48] to show yourself like you're wrestling
[1:12:50] against
[1:12:51] them if somebody's twisted God's going
[1:12:53] to wrestle with them
[1:12:57] right so people don't respect God if
[1:13:00] they're perverse with God they're God's
[1:13:01] going to show them some trouble in their
[1:13:02] life they're GNA well if God's wrestling
[1:13:05] you I mean are you g to even get a move
[1:13:07] on on God now Jacob won because it was
[1:13:09] an angel but it wasn't God Amen God
[1:13:13] would
[1:13:14] just there's no fight here even really
[1:13:17] an angel too God let the Ang or God let
[1:13:19] Jacob beat the angel really the angel
[1:13:20] would have Whi whooped Jacob but look at
[1:13:22] this if you're a perverse person God's
[1:13:24] going to wrestle and fight against you
[1:13:26] and it's going to look like he's Twisted
[1:13:28] against you people say I'm fighting
[1:13:29] again or God's fighting against me he
[1:13:31] might be but that's not God's fault
[1:13:33] that's because you were perverse and
[1:13:35] crooked and frower towards God's word in
[1:13:38] other words you reap what you
[1:13:41] sow people look at Romans nine well God
[1:13:44] didn't show me mercy it's all God just
[1:13:46] didn't choose me but you got to read 2
[1:13:48] Samuel 22 God would show you Mercy if
[1:13:50] you would show
[1:13:51] Mercy if you would be pure pure God
[1:13:54] would show you his Purity church that's
[1:13:56] where I've seen God the most move in my
[1:13:58] life when I'm pure before God I've
[1:14:00] confessed all my sins I've lived as
[1:14:02] close to God as I can that's when I've
[1:14:04] seen God move in the greatest ways amen
[1:14:06] hallelujah when I show myself pure God
[1:14:09] showed himself pure glory amen
[1:14:14] hallelujah but the times I'm not living
[1:14:16] like I should or I'm struggling that's
[1:14:19] when it seems like God's fighting
[1:14:20] against me or wrestling with me
[1:14:23] or things aren't working out like they
[1:14:25] ought to now I'm not preaching a flowery
[1:14:27] bed of EAS or a a picnic a Christian
[1:14:29] picnic I'm talking about the power of
[1:14:31] God and the favor of God the presence of
[1:14:33] God I see the presence of God in my life
[1:14:36] when I'm living as pure as I can to the
[1:14:38] gospel that's when I see God he shows
[1:14:41] himself pure to me in other words he's a
[1:14:43] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:14:50] Him and The Afflicted people thou wil
[1:14:53] save but thine eyes are upon the Hye
[1:14:55] that thou mayest bring them down see God
[1:14:59] does not like
[1:15:01] pride pride will cause a man to stumble
[1:15:04] only by pride comes contention if people
[1:15:07] have many times contention in their
[1:15:08] lives it's because of their own
[1:15:11] Pride they won't say sorry I wrote an
[1:15:14] email to this internet Prophet this week
[1:15:15] he's blasted me so many times I don't I
[1:15:17] just ignore him but I saved up all these
[1:15:19] things 20 24 things he done wrong I
[1:15:21] saved them all up over the years and I
[1:15:23] wrote him back that's what I said I said

[1:15:28] listened all these 24 false doctrines he
[1:15:30] taught and I said that's Pride he's he
[1:15:34] he said thus sayith the Lord everyone in
[1:15:36] the message is under judgment and I said
[1:15:38] that was not God that's a lying
[1:15:43] Spirit I've met
[1:15:45] missionaries that
[1:15:46] have crossed rivers in the Amazon River
[1:15:51] put their lives on the line they they

[1:16:19] about he can't pronounce judgment the
[1:16:22] Bible said I've already pass from
[1:16:23] judgment to life amen hallelujah there's
[1:16:27] no condemnation to them that are in
[1:16:29] Christ
[1:16:30] Jesus and no man no man can lay any
[1:16:32] charge to God's elect amen I said you
[1:16:35] don't even know one tenth of 1% of
[1:16:37] message people who are you to cast
[1:16:38] judgment on them where's the
[1:16:41] mercy but with the with the forward God
[1:16:44] will show himself unsavory God is
[1:16:46] against me God well of course he's
[1:16:48] against you because you're perverting
[1:16:49] the
[1:16:50] word but those of you who are pure God
[1:16:52] will show himself pure to you hallelujah
[1:16:56] hallelujah thank God Romans 9:119 thou
[1:17:00] will say then unto me why does he yet
[1:17:03] find fault for who hath resisted his
[1:17:05] will well everybody resists his will
[1:17:07] that's not a
[1:17:08] Christian right there's a perfect will
[1:17:10] of God Paul says and a permissive will
[1:17:12] of God what did balam do he went the
[1:17:13] permissive route balam resisted his
[1:17:16] will right but then God gave him his
[1:17:19] permissive will and let him get the
[1:17:20] money but he was killed by Israel right
[1:17:22] Israel killed
[1:17:24] them God finds fault because they do
[1:17:27] resist his will there's a broad road
[1:17:29] that leads to destruction there's a
[1:17:31] narrow way that leads to life Hallelujah
[1:17:34] and all those on the broad Road have
[1:17:37] done they've resisted his perfect will
[1:17:40] so God's given them over to God's
[1:17:42] permissive will he said nay verse 20 nay
[1:17:46] but oh man who art thou that repliest
[1:17:48] against God see who's going to talk back
[1:17:49] to God shall the thing form say to him
[1:17:53] that formed it why has Thou made me thus
[1:17:55] now they're talking about AI right now
[1:17:57] might take over the world huh but that
[1:17:59] better be in the Bible first but I don't
[1:18:00] believe it because I don't see that in
[1:18:01] the
[1:18:02] Bible but see AI might turn on the
[1:18:04] humans that made it that's what people
[1:18:06] are are guessing about but that's that's
[1:18:08] what Paul is saying here that's it how
[1:18:10] can humans say why have you made me
[1:18:15] thus hath not the pot power over the
[1:18:19] clay of the same lump now what's lump
[1:18:22] it's Just Grains ground down and add
[1:18:25] water is that right hun is that like a
[1:18:27] lump of dough Just Grains grounded down
[1:18:29] and add some water is that what else is
[1:18:31] in
[1:18:33] there yeah like a it could be lump of
[1:18:35] clay too but I'm talking about like a a
[1:18:37] loaf of
[1:18:39] bread flower water and what salt
[1:18:43] yep see and now the Bible says you you
[1:18:47] in one way you and I are just like a
[1:18:49] lump flow water and salt Hallelujah
[1:18:54] and God takes that he makes one now this
[1:18:55] is of course clay here but you
[1:18:57] understand the the parallel I'm making
[1:18:58] here we're a lump we're this creation of
[1:19:01] God God just mixed us all together right
[1:19:03] but he makes one to honor and another to
[1:19:06] dishonor God is the Potter you and I are
[1:19:09] the
[1:19:10] clay
[1:19:13] Hallelujah now the Bible does call our
[1:19:16] local church a lump that's 1 Corinthians
[1:19:18] 56 56 remember the Corinthian Church was
[1:19:20] a lump they had leav in their lump so
[1:19:22] Church we as a body of Believers we are
[1:19:24] a lump of dough right and we're either
[1:19:27] going to we're either going to keep the
[1:19:28] sin out and be a real solid loaf of
[1:19:31] bread like that that barley loaf that
[1:19:34] rolled down for Gideon hallelujah we're
[1:19:36] going to be this Victorious loaf that
[1:19:38] conquers all the enemies or we fill with
[1:19:40] sin let's keep the sin out of the camp
[1:19:43] like brother Dennis preached to us let's
[1:19:45] get all the leaven out let's confess all
[1:19:47] the sin let's keep all that out let's be
[1:19:49] on fire for Jesus
[1:19:51] Hallelujah let's be a lump that he's
[1:19:53] pleased with nothing added to it just
[1:19:56] flour salt
[1:19:57] water
[1:20:02] unleavened now how is Clay formed or how
[1:20:05] is Clay shaped let me just read this
[1:20:07] real quick Clay is placed in the center
[1:20:09] of the wheel head or on a wooden bat
[1:20:11] that attaches to the wheel head the
[1:20:12] Potter then uses their hands to shape
[1:20:14] the clay as it turns on the wheel now my
[1:20:16] wife is was really good at this was
[1:20:18] because it's been 20 years I think since
[1:20:20] she's done this but there's my for
[1:20:23] minutes that another timer
[1:20:27] [Laughter]
[1:20:30] here I better watch that clock
[1:20:33] tonight but my wife was really good at
[1:20:35] Pottery she gave uh she made all these
[1:20:36] Pottery things and gave them to my
[1:20:38] mother and her mother family and friends
[1:20:41] the clay needs to be wet and slips under
[1:20:43] their hands and fingers Potter use a
[1:20:45] combination of pressure I'm not going to
[1:20:46] pretend to know but you know something
[1:20:48] like this you
[1:20:51] know
[1:20:53] but it's a combination of pressure and
[1:20:56] finger and hand position to form the
[1:20:58] pottery so we need pressure from the
[1:21:01] hand of the Potter am to change your
[1:21:04] life amen to change my life
[1:21:08] amen some do do do you ever you ever
[1:21:11] grow in your walk with God through the
[1:21:12] easy times of Life do you ever really
[1:21:15] grow no Potter's got to put some
[1:21:18] pressure on you make you pray
[1:21:21] again make you really study your Bible
[1:21:23] and call out to get desperate
[1:21:26] again now there's there there's like
[1:21:28] times the P takes it off right add some
[1:21:29] more water they add more water that
[1:21:31] way not pouring it but somehow there's
[1:21:34] water added
[1:21:36] right I didn't get to watch a video I
[1:21:38] didn't watch the
[1:21:39] video the wheel relies on the principle
[1:21:42] of centri cental centrifugal force sorry
[1:21:46] this is the tendency for material to be
[1:21:48] thrown outwards from the center of a
[1:21:51] rotating wheel like a a wheel within the
[1:21:53] middle of a wheel or remember the word
[1:21:56] dance means to whirl so this is like the
[1:21:58] dance of Life Hallelujah we'd say as the
[1:22:02] Earth spins round and around right our
[1:22:04] lives just go As the World Turns that
[1:22:06] wasn't that a soap opera evil soap opera
[1:22:08] I'm glad I never watch that one but that
[1:22:11] that's what that's what we see here life
[1:22:13] just spins in in circles and Cycles
[1:22:17] glory and it throws out away from the
[1:22:20] center the Potter uses their hand hands
[1:22:23] with and against the C centrifugal I can
[1:22:26] C centrifug I can never say that word
[1:22:29] forc to shape the clay this process is
[1:22:31] known as throwing on the wheel ever feel
[1:22:34] like God's thrown your life
[1:22:37] around God threw me to this trial right
[1:22:40] is that right
[1:22:41] church God put pressure on my life he
[1:22:44] threw me to this trial I didn't ask for
[1:22:46] this he threw me into it I'm do to play
[1:22:48] on words right I just thrown into this I
[1:22:52] didn't ask for this The Potter Knows
[1:22:54] what's best
[1:22:55] church and let me say it like this at
[1:22:58] least you're in his hands amen
[1:23:00] hallelujah and the church
[1:23:02] said thank God you're in the hands of
[1:23:05] the one who said I can never forget
[1:23:07] Israel because she's Graven in the palms
[1:23:09] of my hands hallelujah amen but then the
[1:23:12] Bible said you were chosen not in His
[1:23:14] Hands you were chosen in his mind before
[1:23:16] the foundation of the world Hallelujah
[1:23:19] and mine controls the hands brother just
[1:23:23] brother Jesse just needs a little more
[1:23:24] pressure here now whatever shape it
[1:23:26] would be
[1:23:28] right whatever shape he needs on the top
[1:23:30] he'll just pinch those and I'll get the
[1:23:32] right I'll get just the right lid on his
[1:23:35] life
[1:23:37] Hallelujah but I've got to add pressure
[1:23:40] to his
[1:23:41] life because that's the way he's
[1:23:44] changed he's not going to change unless
[1:23:47] I put pressure on him
[1:23:50] Hallelujah all how many love God
[1:23:54] see Church you're always I'll say like
[1:23:55] this until he's done with you you're
[1:23:57] always in his
[1:23:58] hands Hallelujah I love that the Bible
[1:24:02] never said God's going to take me off
[1:24:03] the potter's
[1:24:04] wheel he's going to finish the work
[1:24:07] Hallelujah and that what Philippians 1
[1:24:08] says he that began a good work in you
[1:24:11] will finish that work amen he's going to
[1:24:14] finish his Pottery
[1:24:16] work and then he takes you home amen we
[1:24:20] still got some in our house you know
[1:24:21] I've seen them at my mother-in-law's
[1:24:22] house too some of my wife's uh Pottery
[1:24:25] working you better be you better you
[1:24:27] better believe I treat those real
[1:24:28] carefully I don't throw those around you
[1:24:30] know these are really really special lot
[1:24:34] of hours went to these these vessels
[1:24:38] these blessed vessels H these chosen
[1:24:40] vessels you don't treat it anyway you
[1:24:42] just don't treat it anyway you got to be
[1:24:45] respectful this is a work of The
[1:24:47] Potter's hands aren't you glad he
[1:24:49] doesn't Throw the Clay Away Now say like
[1:24:52] this church we ought to thank God
[1:24:54] tonight if you can say God thank you for
[1:24:56] putting pressure on me because I see my
[1:24:59] life being changed hallelujah amen I'm
[1:25:02] not what I was I'm not what I want to be
[1:25:05] but thank God I'm not like I used to be
[1:25:07] hallelujah amen I see the Potter
[1:25:10] changing my life amen I'm not the same
[1:25:13] Jesse Smith I was I'm not the same
[1:25:15] believer I was even just a few months
[1:25:17] ago God's applied some pressure to my
[1:25:20] life and I've got a new look Hallelujah
[1:25:23] I look different to my to my friends my
[1:25:25] family I feel different praise God it's
[1:25:28] the perspective that I'm in The Potter's
[1:25:32] hands
[1:25:34] Hallelujah now I want to
[1:25:42] close ah there's so much to get here
[1:25:44] Lord help
[1:25:45] me I think I'll just close with uh yeah
[1:25:48] these two verses here bear with me and
[1:25:50] I'm going to jump ahead I'm going to
[1:25:51] come back to this but uh Romans 9:22 now
[1:25:53] here's a what if from Paul now I believe
[1:25:55] Paul's right on this but he says what if
[1:25:57] what if God willing to show his wrath
[1:25:59] speaking of pharaoh now and Esau and to
[1:26:02] make his power known endured with much
[1:26:05] longsuffering the vessels of Wrath
[1:26:08] fitted to destruction let me pause right
[1:26:10] there what did God have with Pharaoh
[1:26:13] long suffering all those years Pharaoh
[1:26:16] was against Israel he made the labor
[1:26:19] harder all those plagues God didn't God
[1:26:23] you know God's in his in his Creator's
[1:26:25] heart it didn't it wasn't something he
[1:26:28] enjoyed he was being longsuffering he
[1:26:30] was being
[1:26:31] merciful time think about that 10 10
[1:26:34] times thus sayi the Lord you know with
[1:26:36] the with the 10 plagues he could have
[1:26:37] repented at any of those
[1:26:39] times and God was longsuffering so I
[1:26:42] want you to see that God is
[1:26:44] longsuffering with judas's
[1:26:46] scarat God was longsuffering with Kora
[1:26:48] they must have been planing that a long
[1:26:49] time ananas and Safa God somehow was
[1:26:54] longsuffering with
[1:26:57] Cain right Esau God was
[1:27:02] longsuffering but God knew what they
[1:27:03] would choose so he had to use them as a
[1:27:05] certain vessel for a
[1:27:08] certain Destiny I'll say it like that
[1:27:11] like the destiny of my wife's uh Pottery
[1:27:13] well it's usually up there some of them
[1:27:16] are for display but some of them we use
[1:27:17] actually every day yeah some of them we
[1:27:20] can some of them you can put in the
[1:27:21] dishwashers some of them I don't know
[1:27:23] can they all go in the dishwasher no
[1:27:26] okay but the ones we use every day they
[1:27:29] can go right there in the dishwasher and
[1:27:31] they're whenever you need them they're
[1:27:32] right there when you need them
[1:27:34] Hallelujah just like that that's how we
[1:27:35] want to be for God we want to be a
[1:27:38] vessel God can use
[1:27:40] Hallelujah but look at verse 23 here
[1:27:42] here's the blessing for you and I and
[1:27:45] that he might make known The Riches of
[1:27:48] his glory check notice this not just
[1:27:51] Glory God wants you to know the richness
[1:27:54] of his glory like one time you might say
[1:27:57] well I felt the glory of God or Glory
[1:27:59] but God says there's Riches of that
[1:28:03] other in other words there's deeper
[1:28:04] deeper levels of Glory that we can
[1:28:06] experience hallelujah praise
[1:28:09] God God's not formed you for Destruction
[1:28:12] God's not formed you for wrath God has
[1:28:14] formed you to show you the riches of the
[1:28:17] glory of God of the holy spirit amen
[1:28:22] think back in your life how many
[1:28:24] wonderful times of Glory can you
[1:28:28] remember great times in the
[1:28:31] Lord right wonderful services or
[1:28:33] wonderful experiences with
[1:28:35] God and yet God says I am I'm rich in
[1:28:39] that I have I have more Glory than that
[1:28:45] Hallelujah like you've heard me like the
[1:28:47] Bible says we the half has never yet
[1:28:49] been told of the riches of his glory
[1:28:52] and like that verse says the best is yet
[1:28:54] to come either of our Lives we either
[1:28:55] see in our lives or we'll definitely see
[1:28:57] in the next life without a
[1:28:58] doubt that half has not yet been told
[1:29:03] see God is going to make known unto us
[1:29:04] Church The Riches of his glory on the
[1:29:06] vessels of
[1:29:09] Mercy remember Mercy is not getting what
[1:29:12] you deserve justice is getting what you
[1:29:16] deserve but Mercy is getting what you
[1:29:18] don't
[1:29:19] deserve I don't deserve a wife and
[1:29:21] children in a church like like we've
[1:29:23] I've got in my life I don't deserve that
[1:29:24] but God's been merciful to
[1:29:26] me Hallelujah I don't deserve a good job
[1:29:29] and a church a p a pastoring position
[1:29:31] like I don't deserve it God showed me
[1:29:34] unmar favor and you you can say the same
[1:29:37] for your life
[1:29:39] Hallelujah but notice he had
[1:29:42] prepared a four unto
[1:29:46] glory god had this all prepared out he's
[1:29:49] going to show you Mercy then he's going
[1:29:51] to show you The Riches of his glory in
[1:29:55] your Earthly Journey let's stand to our
[1:29:57] feet
[1:30:02] Hallelujah and my closing scripture was
[1:30:04] this one Malachi when every ready could
[1:30:06] come up
[1:30:07] at not only does God show longsuffering
[1:30:10] to Sinners Like Pharaoh he also shows
[1:30:13] longsuffering to you and
[1:30:17] I Psalm 8611 teach me thy way oh Lord
[1:30:21] and I will walk thy truth unite My Heart
[1:30:23] To Fear your name that's what we want
[1:30:26] tonight we want a heart that is United
[1:30:28] to God's
[1:30:30] fear I Fear God I and I don't want to
[1:30:32] sin I don't I don't want to fall short
[1:30:34] of God's glory I want to I want to live
[1:30:36] right verse 12 I will praise thee oh
[1:30:38] Lord my God with all my heart I don't
[1:30:40] want to give God half my heart at church
[1:30:43] I want to give God all my heart and I
[1:30:45] will glorify thy name forever
[1:30:48] more for great is thy mercy toward me a
[1:30:52] Psalm of David Hallelujah if anybody
[1:30:54] knew God was longsuffering toward them
[1:30:57] it was David Hallelujah the Giant Slayer
[1:31:00] but also the man who was slain by his
[1:31:01] adulterous heart and slain by his
[1:31:04] murderous
[1:31:05] heart if anybody knew about God's
[1:31:08] mercy being great it was
[1:31:11] David thou Hast delivered my soul from
[1:31:14] the lowest hell church and really that's
[1:31:17] what we're all worthy of the lowest hell
[1:31:20] for there's none that are righteous know
[1:31:22] not one all have fallen short of the
[1:31:25] glory of
[1:31:27] God and yet God extends Mercy to you and
[1:31:30] I that we can enjoy the the depths of
[1:31:34] his glory The Riches of His
[1:31:38] Glory
