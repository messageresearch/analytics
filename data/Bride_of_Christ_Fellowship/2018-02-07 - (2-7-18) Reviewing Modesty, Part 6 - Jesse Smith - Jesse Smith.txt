from Sunday all right sorry does anybody else have any prayer requests for tonight children you think of anything other than we we had some sick children this week Haven was Haven was throwing up the Graham children are still sick okay let's pray for the Grahams and Haven Karras was feeling sick again - so good pray for them okay I have a Bible study not tomorrow but the following Thursday I like to just if you'd join me in prayer for that I appreciate that it's over in Copley with a copy family about tithing and offerings so I'd appreciate if you just pray for me with that one anything else you know the prayer requests tonight I can pray for safe travel for all the saints you know I know three or three people contacting me three families contacted me said they're not coming because of the snow tonight so they probably lived in spots where it didn't get plowed up ours got plowed out fine have you made it kind of a nice blessing and but Adam thanks for shoveling the snow appreciate that thank you sir so let's pray for safe travel and what do you guys go into Florida by the way I'm sorry they told me you're going to Florida next week okay they thought it might be this week I was like I don't remember I'll get this tired okay so safe travel for you and sister PO there and I know uh let's see cabin flies out tomorrow and Murray flight out today so we can pray for Kevin she travels some server system reads probably already there also let me just add one more thing in there I'll just pray for some outreach ideas but Adam and I met a few Saturdays ago we're talking about doing some outreach those dates are gonna come up pretty soon my wife said we should expect them any week now as far as when we can rent a booth and you know pass out tracts or show brother branham's videos or our videos or whatever they want to show let's pray that God will lead us to do something like that to reach out to Souls I just got another check in the mail today they want to donate to our ministry for our video so they sent $45 so I said well praise the Lord so anyways we can use that 45 for the renting of the table there we'd like to do that so I like to do that in the spring or summer you know as soon as we can get out there and so my children I told mommy at the wodsworth and the Doylestown I like to rent a table for our church said I can be there the whole day with you guys and pass out tracts and you know show the Bible and everything like that so let's just pray for that I really I've had a burden for that you know of course for a while but finding the time is hard to do but I was encouraged today I was on the way driving thinking about that and I thought well brother branham's doing what I did until he got until he became a full-time evangelist he pastored for 17 years and he didn't go anywhere he just passed her two held meetings but then when the church could support him after 17 years he got on a salary then he just went around the world preaching you know so I thought well I'm doing everything I can do by God's grace trying to balance life and ministry and everything like that I do I do want to pray for that that God will give us wisdom for some outreach by God's grace okay I guess we'll go for Lord in prayer let's go and pray here [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]

preach another message on review and modesty I finished chapter 7 this week so very thankful for that we had a snow day today so I'm almost done with the last chapter by God's grace oh my my own no I never turned myself on okay alright pardon me see having a snow day with today and I got a lot of chapter 8 done so I was very happy about that I like to go over chapter 7 chapter 7 was on YouTube testimonies and questions and answers so I'll be doing some questions and answers and pulling some a few scriptures out by God's grace 1st Peter 3:15 also I just want to offer to you know I know people are watching live streaming too if anybody wants a copy my rough draft when I'm done maybe this weekend let me know if you want to read it and and if you want I'll print it out on paper and you can mark up all the things that you think might be better or any mistakes I'm gonna pay a couple people to edit it for me cuz that's a lot of readin so it'll be over 40,000 words but if anybody's interested in that anybody you know I'm gonna let my wife do it I could really use help with that I'm gonna ask brother camber the cam said he would he'd read it for me and edit it up and I was gonna try to get brother Brooks and brother Jim schumake and maybe brother Craig and maybe brother Simon I want to get brother Samuel too if they'll do it I haven't talked to them yet but I want to contact them and see if and if they can't read the whole thing maybe just one chapter you know I could get each person to read one chapter I get a lot of good feedback from these ministers I want to be a blessing so let's go to 1st Peter Peter 3:15 okay let's read this on three one two three but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear let's have one more word of Prayer tonight let's bow our heads here Heavenly Father we love you tonight Lord Lord as the song says there we give ourselves away one more time Lord another time in prayer as with every prayer we give ourselves away for your glory take away our our thoughts lord help us to cast out anything that might be distracting us from you lord I just pray God that your word would be exalted in our hearts and lives today be glorified Jesus thank you for providing all these answers Lord for us Lord certain each one of us needs the answers from the scripture Lord for the Bible says the Spirit is truth and it dissolves all doubts father were grateful Lord for what you have done I just pray Lord speak to us tonight bless the saints oppress their way out to the house of the Lord father those livestreaming speak to them in their homes Lord may they feel your presence Lord in their midst Lord Jesus may angels visit each home tonight Lord this church in Jesus Christ's name and the church said amen god bless you didn't see let's get started here so chapter 7 as I said it's called YouTube testimonies and questions and answers so I want to go over this I'm up to 36,000 994 words so I'm very thankful for that and I want to start I just start off the chapter by saying a little bit about YouTube how it's a very popular website and there's more content uploaded on YouTube every day than the first 60 years of the broadcasting company oh you put all that video together all the gigabytes there's more put on YouTube in like one week than the previous 60 years from the beginning of television because it's just expanding so so much but I I just use some scriptures to show that YouTube should be used as a tool for Christians but they should never set anything wicked before their eyes according to Saul 101 verse three David said I was sent in a wicked thing before my eyes I hate the work of them that turn aside it shall not cleave to me so you know back in 2004 I received the message in 2001 but in 2004 brother Brooks did a community Jubilee in Lima and it was like a summer event of two days it was a two day event and he did it two summers in a row he did it in 2004-2005 and for those two events we just come in the message and we're really on fire and loving everything and for those two events I just had this desire to make gospel materials in other words to put the the message on video and the message on paper so what we did is I asked brother Brooks if we could have a special service and so I we had a special Saturday service and I preached on how TV is the unclean thing I preached on television the unclean thing and brother brother vang was brother banging me brother banging brother John I think recorded the video and the audio and they made a DVD and I think the DVD is actually out there on the shelf back from 2005 I think 2005 if I'm not mistaken and then brother Craig asked by his brother Craig if he would do a video and he preached on I think it's out there too about the wheat and the tares I believe he taught on that or every scene must bring forth of its own kind and so we started making gospel materials and that was like the beginning of just my desire to get the Word of God out in a different format now I believe this like we preached in the Philadelphia Church age the the main way to get the gospel out is through the preaching of the word live preaching is God's intended away to get the word out but like brother Graham said there's forms there's different forms of the gospel like there's printing Bibles there's passing out Bibles he said there's passing out tracts whatever form the gospel goes in its brother Graham said it's a fine thing it's a good thing but the main thing is for people to come to church and hear the gospel preached amen that's what we got to get that's what we've got to Ernest Lee contend for so if like for example if we do if we do outreach you know and a fare something like that or if we do postcards whatever we do we've got to try to get people to come here the Word of God because in this presence we know where the presence of Jesus Christ is they can feel God's presence and they can be convicted by the Holy Spirit and they can like the Bible said they can have the secrets of their hearts revealed by the Holy Spirit and then they'll know that God is here that's what the Bible says in first Corinthians 14 it's so important to get people here in the seats and the nice thing is we got plenty of seats so we want to do that like I said but we need the timing I need the time I need the energy and the resources I just I've kind of put that off I haven't you know when you have to prepare three sermons a week I just haven't had as much time to devote to that like I like to and I've had this great burden as well I think I think having a book and +50 YouTube videos I think that will be a lot for penny if anyone new comes I think it'd be great as a resource to show to them and give them right away we got the church age books out there and the message books we want to have plenty of material but the main thing to do the ultimate goal is to get people into the service so they can sense the presence of the Holy Ghost be convicted and get saved and then hopefully get sanctified and get filled with the Holy Ghost that's the most important thing but remember even those little brother branham cards that we used to have out there brother mike dirnt all from lima picked up one of those and he left his homosexual lifestyle and came to the message just from a card he he mailed voice of God they sent that the books back he said where's the church that preaches us and he drove to Lima all those years and became a real saint of God amen and he still he's the first one of the church he opens a church every time he closed the church he's a faithful man of God amen so see that God can use any form and we just want to be faithful now after we started the church John brother John Graham did a tremendous job with gospel materials printing I don't know if sister Beau remembers at her I know bang wood but John we bought a laser printer and then we brought bought a lathe to print paper then we bought a laser printer to to print color labels on DVDs and so we had the top-of-the-line and I think we might do that again Lord willing we'll see so we could make the highest quality DVDs and and CDs and we distributed many of those we share them with different churches and mailed them out to people who ordered them we try to make as many copies as we could but you know as the years went by you know our families grew and jobs required more of us and I you know I was doing my graduate work and John started working more hours you know and so we we stopped that ministry we just had enough time for but you know that burden to take the gospel never left me so in 24 2013 I started tinkering with oh I could do video editing because I started to bet editing videos for my school ID edit videos and make slideshows of our pictures and so huh I thought well maybe I can do that for the gospel so I started researching on how to make videos that's when I bought the green screen and the cameras and and that's when I made my first video water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus and that was in 2014 I finally posted one on the Internet but I put out on Vimeo because I was scared I might get backlash on YouTube I was kind of scared and I look back now and I should not have been fearful but I was fearful I thought people might get upset I thought I might lose my job if people found out you know that what I believed but since you know I have numerous people have found out and they just just kind of say well that's just Jesse I guess but I was fearful so I just put on you or Vimeo because I knew there was less people on Vimeo after and after two years I'm sorry I sure AM it's just really grown since then we have over 240,000 views and over 2400 subscribers since then and and now we're able to just basically put anything on there we like to do but since then come compile many testimonies I wanna read a few testimonies here's one from overseas this brother never left me a name but he said your videos play a huge role in my life I've got no words to say I become speechless about your help I think I better say I love you my pastor now I hope you understand I'm not as pastor but that was a nice encouraging comment there from a foreigner that's just about the overall videos in general now remember these are testimonies are important because the Bible said we overcome Satan by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of our testimony so we've got to have some testimony at some point saying where this really encouraged me or this is when God spoke to me you know I was encouraged last week at middle school Bible Club one of the parents raised her hand said mr. Smith can I share this real quick and I said sure he said you know all of us have heard the voice of God who had been saved and he said he said think about it what caused you to repent and get baptized you heard the voice of God now how did you hear it is your audible voice maybe not but what did you hear you heard God's voice you who you felt God's conviction on your heart saying I need to repent I need to clean up my life I'm I'm ashamed of my sin I want to repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so that was such an encouragement you know and that's how the YouTube videos work as well we might not have heard an audible voice saying you need to go get baptized on this day and you know February 7 2018 we might not hear that but we hear conviction we hear we feel the pole as brother Branham says the Bible we feel the pull and that proves we've heard the voice of God now we have to take that same thought and apply it to tonight's service right and apply it to Sunday service or tomorrow morning when we read our Bible we've got to take that same thought lord help me to feel your voice or feel your conviction like I felt when I got saved and that by doing that we can keep ourselves sensitive to the voice of God so that's why these testimonies are so important I'm gonna read this one again just because maybe some of our lives she was in here but a couple months ago a person said the video on the Lord Jesus Christ's baptism saved their soul I said your YouTube channel not only helped me to know God better but also guided me to follow God's will hopefully the videos will save and help a lot more lost souls like me thank you for making these videos you saved my soul that was from November 2017 this one was popular about make up it said I fasted three days and asked God to show me about makeup and I just opened my YouTube and here you are talking about makeup it was amazing God answered my prayer many thanks brother you really helped me I'll share this video with other sisters three days fasting to know about makeup this one is uh these next ones are about makeup here these next few about makeup this says thank you for making this video help me to realize there's no such thing as modest makeup you ever heard that I'm gonna use makeup in a modest way and the individual realized by the help of the Holy Spirit there's no such thing as modest makeup even though there are churches twisting Bible verses to keep their members another one says I'm not wearing makeup no more another one says I'm throwing away my makeup another one says thank you for this video I don't wear a lot of makeup but I'm completely done with what I was using amen okay now this one I think this goes to oh no this is still a makeup okay the argument you made based entirely on God's holy and perfect word has convinced me to stop wearing makeup I love that all right all the videos we do we never try to do just say brother branham said brother branham said brother ram said we try to show them the scriptures that brother branham said point them to the Word of God that our prophet brought out and then they said could you please I would deeply and greatly appreciate if you could do us more videos addressing if wise virgins should wear trousers women should wear trousers or should wear jewelry or whether we should hide all of our legs or not so I pointed them to the video I already had on long dresses in the Bible and now I can point that individual to this book once we get it done by God's grace this is a really good one this is from a woman named Gail she emails me all the time Washington all the time every now and then email me repeatedly she said after I watching your video I was a makeup guru before your video I love how I could transform and look like somebody else and that's so sick like just that's what I brother Ram said people are insane and I'm not I'm not bashing this woman you understand I'm not master but like what what kind of thought process would you have to have where you'd say I want to transform I don't want to be what God made me to be shouldn't we have enough faith and love for God that he made us the way he wanted us to be shouldn't we have such love and trust and just have unwavering faith that I am what God wanted me to be amen one morning shortly after I saw your video God said skip make up this morning and spend the extra time with me and she said I obeyed and I loved it little by little makeup became less and less attractive sometimes it wouldn't even go on right and have to wash it all off I like that I like when the when Satan's plans get messed up hallelujah and every day I noticed how in the evening as it was wearing off my face look worse than it did without any makeup on hey men see Church do you see how God's trying to give her the eye salve of the Holy Spirit before she all she saw with her eyes was all I look prettier with makeup but once the Holy Spirit brings conviction it puts ice out on her eyes and she can see what she really is according to God's Word she's ugly with makeup on that's exactly right then one day I was reading the scripture and the thought came to me and said why do you paint your face to gain men's approval and then she said after that I stopped wearing makeup cold turkey I felt naked and self-conscious at first but now I've gone about two months without it and I don't miss it I don't feel naked without it either I don't get it near the compliments from men or women I used to but that's okay because that would lead me down a wrong path anyway see the reason this woman put it on was to get compliments from people see that's pride wants people's attention for the wrong reason not the right reason to glorify herself instead of glorifying Christ alright and I and she's the emailed numerous times over the last few years and thankful for the victories there now let's go on these fewer about long dresses in the Bible that video I think it's got thirty-nine thousand yeah it's got thirty-nine thousand views this woman said I've been struggling for many years regarding my wardrobe finally I'm sorry I listened to so many opinions finally I picked up my phone and began the internet search and I came across you pastor after listening the message I cleaned out my closet completely I'd like to thank you for clarifying the importance of dressing modestly I'm really grateful to God and to this ministry for today I can say I no longer wish to dress as I did but according to the Bible hey hallelujah I love it two days later she wrote how she shared it with friends and her and her friends were going to the local goodwill she said I want to thank you for the impact this video has had upon my life she said praise God God never fails amen hallelujah this one says I watched your video many months ago but your message left a seed inside of my soul I love that a seed of the word so that member goes back to the four types of ground that seeds fall on this must have been a at least a good ground or maybe it's a ground that's the third kind of ground I would get choked by the things of the world we'll see we'll see on the day judgment I've been wearing skirts and dresses for the last few months and I feel liberated look at that and then Jesus say he whom the Sun is set free is free indeed hallelujah I cannot go back to wearing pants because the Holy Ghost makes me feel dirty when I do it look at that thank you put it for putting this profound message on the internet now it's not me that's profound it's God's Word that's profound it's profound it blows your your mind it illuminates your mind it transform your mind like the Bible said by the transforming of your mind be renewed by the transformation of your mind hallelujah I of testimonies like this long let's do some long hair in the Bible testimonies thank you brother Smith this was a blessing to me and I fully understand now that should not even trim my hair another one says thank you for this message before I used to cut my hair like a boy but I will never my life cut my hair again now I know it's against God's Word thank you so much man of God that was really nice say that I said you're not far from the kingdom see cos now if she don't cut her hair now she can reverence her husband before she couldn't do that she brought shame to herself she brought dishonor to herself and dishonored to her husband but now she's closer to the kingdom of God I watched your videos on YouTube about modest clothing okay I must have mixed up oh no okay this is the model yeah we those I only did two hair video testimonies and these are modest clothing it said immediately after watching your video I was aware that I need to make adjustments on the clothing that I currently own I'm so blessed to have come across your channel by the way another one says thank you for delivering your message in a kind loving way it's confirmation I actually just asked God how do you want me to dress then I stumble on your video glory to God I like this real short but says thank you dear I'm transformed hey and that was on the four guidelines for modest clothing I'm transformed that's what Romans 12:1 and 2 says be transformed by the renewing of your mind ok let's go over some frequently asked questions that I get for each one of these some of them I already went I'm sorry one of them already went over for makeup I had three questions the first ones about Esther I'm not gonna go over that one because we've covered that when we went over Esther she's never given cosmetics she was given oils for her skin and maybe face you know but it wouldn't be makeup it would just be oils to make her skin clean um the second one is on acne a makeup to cover acne or scars which I thought was a really good question Oh ask is that literally a sin to wear makeup so here's my answers are you ready for questions and answers okay the first one is Esther second one is what about someone a lady who has defects like acne scars or other scars from an accident or surgery or a bad burn that can be covered with full cover foundation the woman says a little blush come on what if it's about if it's your daughter your wife with aging spots feeling ugly in front of you see how she's working on your emotions what about it's your hunter what about you know it's just come on just a little blush what do you think my answer was what do you think I said a little leaven leavens the whole lump now church I don't laugh I'm not laughing at I'm just laughing at that comment because I think that's the right Bible answer like it's the wisdom of God a little blush a little leaven leavens the whole lump but what I said is I'm very sensitive I said I'm sorry about any accidents or surgeries or burns you may have had but I said I would encourage those with scars or accidents or burns to seek God about this topic because we know God never changes it would seem God would give all them the same answer makeup as a heathen trait and if people see their scars or things marks or burns and said that could be used for a testimony like for example my mom got burnt when I was growing up she had a oil fire she was burning oil on the stove and had a literal fire at our upstairs home and it she tried to put it out with water and that's like the word and I didn't know that you know I wouldn't I would done the same thing I never had training on fires you know but she just tried to put out water and it exploded and went all over her arm into this day she still has a huge scar but anyway she was able just to use that as a testimony instead of trying to you know cover this over I have surgery she's used that as a testimony like me and my me and my ignorance almost blew up my entire home but God had mercy on me and spared me from death now someone who's got a burn on their face you know and might it might make them feel an awkward but remember there guy there's got to be a testimony behind it if you're still alive you've still got grace right you've still got an opportunity to show grace or to receive the grace of God and all these little things can be all those little things with all the all the scars or all the burns or the surgeries can all be ways to share about God like yeah I did have to have the surgery but thank God this and this and this didn't happen as well now for acne I can use my own testimony when I eat too much sugar or when I used to drink pop or when I wouldn't sleep well I got a lot of acne and so the people that I've shared this with they've actually responded and say you're right my acne instead of using makeup to cover it up I need to change my diet I need to change my sleeping habits now that's not forever but I know some people have acne and it might be uncontrollable but there's usually something you can do when it comes to acne from at least from what I've heard I'm not a doctor we'd have to ask brother Scott or somebody else who knows but I just know in my personal experience if I eat right and drink water and get good enough sleep I don't get acne but when I eat sugar don't sleep and don't drink enough water I'm gonna get acne and so a couple people did respond and say that they they felt the same thing about that now if you're feeling if you're getting older and you see aging spots just let the glory of God light your face just be anointed with the love of God listen we're all gonna get old brother branham said it's a shame that people program said they want to look back in the rearview mirror and try to live what they were when they were 20 years old he said you shouldn't do that he said because if you stare in your rear-view mirror you're gonna get an accident by what's in front of you you're missing what's in front of you by staring in the rearview mirror too long they said you're gonna get an accident and that's what all these I think I just saw Jane Fonda just put out a book right and she was this seductress from the 70s she's 70 years old and she has so many surgeries she's just still trying to seduce people still after all these years she's trying to get rid of all these wrinkles but she got wrinkles no wrinkles here but she's got wrinkles on her neck like what see it's just a spirit they just were there just a lust and they know that if they're trying to be sexy they can try to make more money and they should just cast that down and don't put anything on except the glory of God amen so I said that I said I know that see that may seem harsh but we shouldn't wear makeup any under condition because we must obey Jesus based upon our love and His Holy Bible you said a little blush but to me I respectfully say a little leaven leavens the hold up a little bit of sin is still sin I said we must not love the things of the world okay and then the question three they asked me straight out is wearing makeup a sin and I said yes and my scripture to prove that is Jeremiah 10 - let's read that you got your Bible Jeremiah 10 - now it doesn't specifically say those that paint their faces are sinning but it does say not to learn the ways of the heathen Jeremiah 10 - and this is the chapter that has the supposed Christmas trees in it but member I kind of preach on that with Christian Liberty I don't I don't know if you can really say this is a Christmas tree it looks a lot like it and to me it's it's close enough where I'm not going to put up a tree in my house but if people want to that's fine that's between them and God if that makes them closer to God fine or if it has to no it has no impact and it's just a neutral like a Christian Liberty like eating meat or eating herbs or vegetarian fine you can be happy just thank the Lord right that's a no matter if you do it or don't do it just thank the Lord praise God that's the main thing thank God okay verse 1 here you the word which the Lord speaking on you o house of Israel thus saith the Lord learn not the way of the heathen and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven for the heathen are dismayed at them now he goes and lists this issue about cutting down the tree but I would be I would agree and I'm sure you would too that any key than sinful act would be a sin and who is the first person who is the originator of makeup wearing the history says Jezebel the history says we're actually from the people I've read different preachers I've heard that of read history say that Jezebel actually had it before the Egyptians I don't know if that's true but that's what I was told because of this that's saying where it says you're painting up your face like a Jezebel you know things like that so Jezebel her father was a heathen King I forget the actual name of it I can't think of it now can't think of it now there's a some ight he was ight it's in first Kings 16 I know that for sure cuz Jezebel or a hab starts with Elijah in chapter 17 I can't remember it many ways she she learned her heathen ways from her father her father was a murderer the Bible says that and then she becomes a murder because he then's when they worship they would sacrifice human beings and so she must have learned that from her heathen worship and then of course when it comes to her day of judgment she no ji who is gonna try to come kill her what'd she do she paints her face in defiance and tries to put the blame on ji who remember that so didn't armour you do the same thing you're gonna be just like Omri there's our Zimri did you come up Lydia did you pull that up okay it's chapter 6 it's at the end of chapter 16 but you can keep looking though just raise your hand when you let it let me get that now like the woman a row that Gayle woman nice woman go to proverbs 616 let's go to proverbs 616 this so if you put a couple scriptures together you can see the sin behind wearing makeup it's pride its seduction its lust but definitely pride as this one woman was actually on and honest enough to admit it was pride she wanted to get people's attention she wanted people to think she was pretty she wanted to create a new face to get more attention the does Adoni ins thank you very much the donee is not heights but maybe it's a Donen the dough nights I don't know is that a word I don't know proverbs 6 16 and 17 but the zidonians I I could look it up I did look it up I preached on it I just forgot we could look up and see the actual heathen gods that they worshipped proverbs 616 and 70s anyone read that for me Adam thank you mother Q read 16 and 17 all right yeah we can stop right there it goes on to say a few more but what these things these seven things God hates the first one is a proud look and isn't makeup wearing they paint their eyes and like cats and or whatever they do isn't that a pride is that issue of pride because they don't think they're pretty enough because they're influenced by whatever TV shows are watching or movies or their family and they feel like they've got to make themselves prettier but that's pride that's not humility that's exalting yourself above other people right I'm gonna be more pretty as even exalting you're trying to make yourself greater than yourself you know then your natural self we'd say God hates a proud look and then no doubt Jezebel shed innocent blood as well so Jezebel did numerous of these abominations all right awful so see that's what I told the individual when you paint your face it's a sin because it's usually either press either pride motivating it or lust it's one it's got to be one of those you don't feel good about yourself your self esteems down and I hate to say like that but our esteem should not our esteem should not be in self our esteem should be in God amen our God esteem you know we should we should feel good about God the only way we feel good about ourselves is when we see Christ in us amen crucifying the flesh you know baying the Holy Spirit that's what you feel good about ourselves I thank God that I thank God that he's helped me to overcome myself and crucify my flesh okay next one now these are neck those are the three on make up let's go to long dresses and the Bible questions they said brother Jesse when did this rule too for women to wear pants I'm sorry not wear pants originated because she said both men and women wore robes in the Bible now that's true they both did wear robes but I found that the his three and I preach on it women women their garments went all the way down to the ground so you could tell right away a man's went somewhere past the knee okay and a man actually actually had an extra cloak upon him his outer garment was different I went to a Jewish website it's called Hebrew - was it history or origins or org it's a nice organization of Jews and they actually show a picture of what the different garments are so a man and I just saw this a man in his outer garment was called the cloak and his cloak was like a long jacket like a trench coat we know what a trend you guys know what a trench coat is it's a long coat it's really long it goes like down past the knees and so he had the man had numerous garments on but his outer garment was like a trench coat and it was split so you could pull it apart like Peter took off his outer garment to go fishing but the woman's our outer garment could not be taken off it was not cut down the middle it was just a full garment like a full dress okay and that was a really good thought there because Jesus said if a man asks for your coat give him your cloak also so Jesus talks about that how a man would have numerous garments numerous layers and of course the woman would have you know a tunic layer but then she also had another outer garment layer but it was not split down the middle so you could tell right away you could tell by looking at a man that's a man he's got the cloak on you could tell a woman she's got this full garment down it's not split down the middle doesn't button up it's just a full garment so next time you watch a movie about the days of Jesus look for those that's I've seen him before I've seen that in movies where the woman had doesn't have her garment is not like an outer coat sound like a coat it's just just one long garment I'll have to find a movie there so to kind of prove that that'd be good I know I've seen him before let me set my timer I don't want to go too late last time I've been going so late here my wife gently reminds me I'm trying to go a little less here just let's go so long okay so I told this woman those facts about cokes and clothes cloaks as soon as you look you could tell the difference on first glance oh that's a man that's a woman by the outer garment but I said as far as when pants came in from my study of history which I was more limited I'm not a fashion historian like at the University or something like that what's the study of humans called anyway what's that called there's on the tip of my tongue I thought Bao Zhi was study of life like all kinds of life what there's a a word I could ask Siri but I'm not gonna do it during the service there's no I don't think it's Anatomy that I'm sorry there's this as a word I can D given right now the study of humans it's so like the people who would have a degree in social studies would have they'd have this ology I forget what it is I have to look it up after the after the service sorry but there's an and mat mrs. master McCrae Malakai she's that's her job that's a wife - ask her tomorrow she would tell us she's told me before it's something with the AIDS bugging me sorry so I'm not one of those like our friends the McRae's but I found in the 1600s men started wearing pants in the 1600s so those robes eventually kind of came up and then the breach is underneath got longer so that's what we found at least with the European history and I don't know about Asian history I don't know about African history I don't know how but with European history which led of course you know our founding fathers you know to the North America here their breeches would became longer and then their robes came up and then then they had a separate that a separate church and then separate breeches which the breeches now became pants that was in the 1600s but I just reminded this individual through this through the entire history of the Bible so from 1300 BC when God told Moses Deuteronomy 22:5 it's abomination for a woman to put on a man's garment from 1300 BC all the way to today the true believers Jews or Christians have always had two separate garments for men and women always and you can prove that because Jesus obeyed Deuteronomy 22:5 Paul would have obeyed it and George Washington obeyed it Lincoln obeyed it all those guys obeyed it so that that's that's this that's the principle so it doesn't have to be pants and skirts that that's just for our culture so that's what I tell them as well if you live in a different culture we're like India where they have different male-female garments will then praise the Lord the main thing is God doesn't want confusion coming into this society and that's what we have here in America because of cross-dressing so I spend and then of course referenced Bruce Jenner he's the example of cross-dressing and everybody everybody always shuts up after that they never they never write me back about once I mentioned Bruce Jenner because it's a witness against them here's a man talks like a man dresses like a woman has surgeries to cut off body parts that pertain to manhood and does all these paints our face there's all these awful things claiming to be a woman wearing women's clothes that's insanity that's perversion that's confusion God is not the author of that amen and so they can't say nothing against it and I said well yeah you disagree with that what about in the 1920s and 1930s when women started wearing pants a little bit and there was such a up for remember Audrey Hepburn remember that I see those those things people forget about that okay here's a good question about separation of garments this person asked me if you teach two for women not to wear pants do you also teach that we should not wear the same t-shirts as men socks as men undergarments and all these other like everything and I say well I don't have a scripture for that I said but my wife and I do that I don't wear my wife's socks she doesn't wear my socks right she doesn't wear my t-shirts I don't where he or her t-shirts I look pretty bad in her t-shirts and I would never wear them because they probably don't fit me so in in application we we're told that we never wear any garments that are the same except maybe you know you throw on the same jacket to run out to the garage for a few seconds you but I've told people to even if a woman wears her husband's t-shirt out you know or something like that is that gonna cause anybody to stumble as long as she has her long hair on it has a long skirt on they can still tell she's a woman so I I said I don't never actually know how to answer that but in practice that's what I do I have a set we have totally separate garments I don't even wear my wife's shoes because they don't fit I mean it's just kind of common sense like that but see people have some good question that's it that was it that was probably one of the most challenging questions I've had so I thought I'd share that with you it's interesting what people think of you no but I understand that like how far do you take some of these things that's a that's a that's an honest question that's a good question and that's how that's how I would say that's what I told her that's how I would do it I would just have a total separation I don't wear my wife's clothes she don't wear my clothes then we have no then we have no convictions like we're sinning right then whatever we do hadn't done it whatever you do whenever we do parmi is done in faith because if you doubt then it's into you the Bible says okay then this woman asks why can't pants on a woman be modest what about women that work out and I said well pants can technically be modest on a woman they can be loose but it's still cross-dressing it's still an abomination because it still looks like the garments breeches that pertain to men just like a man a man can wear a modest dress Bruce Jenner could wear a modest dress and be modest and not show off his male body parts but it's still cross-dressing you see that I mean I don't understand what they're saying but they're still breaking one of the laws of God one of the four guidelines that God placed and then I said I know and then I said as far as working on skirts I said I know numerous women who work out in full length skirts my wife works out at home in full length skirts she just she works out there in front of the children there in the living room and she always makes sure she's covered and she only does exercise that don't expose anything because that's what a Christian does a Christian doesn't expose themselves at any time Christian's don't compromise on the Word of God and I said if any exercise makes you endanger like you're gonna trip and fall don't do that exercise do a different exercise the God of heaven can't come up with a different exercise so you won't have to transgress his word I mean the thing is they haven't asked God about it they've got to seek God about that so I said you gotta have wisdom to know which exercise to do gotta avoid exercise that are dangerous avoid exercise that expose yourself or what would force you to crossdress just don't do it just stay away from sin oh then the other question was about a job what if your job requires the wear pants I would say first tell them that they can't deny you work basically because you're they're discriminating against your religion that's the first thing you can say but it's hard people are just they're all fearful about money which they've got to get victory over that if God asks you to wear skirts then he's got to provide a job for you to wear skirts in amen and he will he's Jehovah Jireh praise God what Christian would ever take a job that forces them to break the word of God how could you live with yourself the only way you could live with yourself is if you're in the permissive will of God and you're not born again but a Holy Ghost field person could not live with themselves they'd have to ask God for another job amen they would just trust in the Word of God because breaking the word of God is not in the plan of God that's in the plan of the permissive will of God that's a plan of iniquity and that is of the devil s not of God okay I had three hair length questions these are pretty good questions what about the ends of my hair they get split and frazzled and damaged is it okay to trim the loose ends and I say dear friend no there is nothing in the Bible about trimming women's hair in the entire Bible from cover to cover from Genesis to Revelation trimming it is is shaving it according to first Corinthians 11 and I said I've heard different opinions because her opinion was oh people say it's your hell's hair or your hair is healthier if you trim your hair and I said I've heard different I've talked to numerous women including my wife who say it's actually healthier if you don't but you still got to take care of it you just can't you can't like spray chemicals on it and do all these kinds of a dyeing your hair I don't know what I don't know all the terms in other word you can't add all these manmade chemicals and then X let hair it make your hair grow long and then expect it to get healthier you've got to treat it in a healthy manner you can't add things to it you got to wash it you got to brush it all the time you got to take care of it my girls all know all about it there's a lot of work it's a lot of work to take care of the hair but it's also a lot of work to live the Word of God right so we must we must just deal with that we must deal if that's what God wants that's what God's Word said we're happy to do it so I I just tried to say that it's actually healthier if you don't and all these chemicals and cut it's actually healthier the second one how exactly or how long do you think a man's hair is allowed to be what what would you say would be the maximum length so for this one I didn't really have any scripture to say other than so I used history I didn't have any scripture other than it must be short the Bible said if a man has long hair which means uncut it's a shame unto him so I just use a historical article I think I had a Bible Almanac that said the Jews that were poor they would just take all their hair like this in a ponytail and take the knife and cut it and then they let that hang down so it'd probably hang down to like here most Jews now that's what I read in the Almanac so that's what the men would do not the women the men the women didn't cut their hair right so that's what we find I have no scripture about how long it would be but now brother Branham said you know the angel Lord had hair down to the shoulder so that's what I tell people that asked me I said well if you technically grow your hair to your shoulder you're an angel company then but to me though would cause a little bit of confusion and I pictures I can show you what my hair looked like when it was down here Ike it looks very feminine I don't like how it looks it doesn't look very manly so to me men should be the leaders in humility and modesty and and so forth so men should have their hair as short as they short as they can so it looks like a man if they expect women to grow theirs as long as they can men should have it rather short like I told you I'd rather prefer my hair just shave it but my wife likes it a little hunger so Amen okay the third question it says um didn't Jesus have shoulder length hair so they're kind of like mocking me a little bit and I said no no one knows exactly the length of Jesus hair no one knows but we know it was an uncut because Jesus is the one who told Paul to write that women should have uncut hair because deep Paul said he learned the gospel from Jesus right in Galatians chapter one he learned it from Jesus Christ himself so Jesus would not have long uncut hair like a woman if he tells Paul that Christian woman should only have long hair and so he says well what about all these pictures of Jesus while these movies and pictures have Jesus with hair down to his down his back and I said well it could be two reasons first it might be Satan influencing the artists and movie producers to deceive people as Pro traying Christ as a woman with like a woman with long hair it might be Satan and but I said second it actually could be that Jesus had length shoulder length hair but that would have been way shorter than the women of that day because they all had long uncut hair they all did because the first time I can find anyone cutting their hair is the roaring 20s the first time now the Egyptians might have I think there's hieroglyphs that picture there was their hieroglyphs of Egyptians that you guys show me one time or not okay I thought you didn't either clothes how they dressed almost naked remember that you show me the hieroglyphs er okay yeah they were really of course they were sinners learn not the way of the heathen but I thought there are pictures of women with short hair there okay yeah the hieroglyphs remember their hairs cut cross so yeah God's people never cut their hair to the roaring 20s but then they weren't God's people anymore so they're no longer God's people they forfeited they broke the Word of God and for salvation that's between them and God I don't know God God is rich in mercy but we know it's a sin it's a shame for a woman to cut her hair dishonours her husband okay oh and here's one that kind of I felt bad about an Africa african-american woman wrote and said you're being racist because black women can't grow their hair long and she said is God unfair because I don't have long hair in other words she's saying why can the other women of other races have long hair and I can't and I said oh please forgive me I'm sorry I said I'm not racist I said what I forgot I forgot to put in the video of that women of different races have different hair links and I said God is not interested in 12-inches 2430 God's not interest in the number of inches he's interested in obedience to his word with uncut hair so I said I'm sorry I said I'll put that in the book because once you get a video on YouTube you can't change it you can't edit it I mean just a little thing about YouTube I don't like that about YouTube but I understand it cuz the video has to process once it's edited has to process and save as a new file so I can't change it what I could do though is make another video I could make a part 3 on long hair in the Bible ok so that's a great question no that was a great question and I felt bad about that you know I didn't I didn't add that to the video because the title my videos long hair and the Bible and so a black woman who can't would grow hair long she might that might hurt her feelings I felt mad about that there's my hour so let me finish with this give me 10 minutes let me finish with this yeah ok this is the end of the chapter that worked out perfectly I thought I might have to go and further into chapter 8 because chapter 8 is called the perfect will of God and I want to prove at the end that we can prove that the way we dress is not just an option it's the perfect will of God there is no other way to dress and is that beautiful we can prove that no one else can prove that if they wear shorts they cut their hair they get tattoos you know earrings that have holes in it you know makeup they could they are not they can't prove by the Bible that they're in the perfect will of God were the only ones that can do you glory and then I spend that time showing out we're in the purple of God and I list each one skinny jeans not the will of God Sun us Sun dresses not the will of God and I show how you know shorts miniskirts not the will of God so I just want them to see that you can prove that the way you're dressing is either the perfect will of God or the permissive will of God and then I'm going to do it I haven't finished this part but i'ma show I'm introduced where I get all my ideas from brother branham's ministry I'm an interest brother branham's ministry and I'm gonna close with revelation 3 where it says I counsel II to have clothes white raiment because I believe Jesus to the latest in church age he's saying it I believe both for spiritually and naturally I believe Jesus is telling the churches you need to get physical clothes on and you need to get eternal life on I believe that with all my heart he said get your naked your blood and you don't even know it so I want to end the book with that I want to just drive that home people are naked today spiritually and naturally and they don't even know it amen hallelujah alright last now for the to end the chapter I show the one question that has come up in every video series it's come up in the long hair it's come up in the makeup it's coming in the long dresses of the Bible come up with the other one - I can't more anything in the last one I'm sorry let's go on your Bibles to 1st Samuel 16:7 I'll look up real quick I can look it up online oh yeah modest clothing in the Bible yeah there you go there's the for long hair long dresses makeup and modest clothing there's those are the four main ones and those are my top four videos which is interesting of all the videos in the 50 videos those four are the ones that are have the most views by far - in fact 20 thousand more the highest non holiness video I have is thus saith the Lord by William Branham prophecies of the future that only has nine thousand views makeups got 85 now and then it's got sixteen thousand on the other one so we're past hundred thousand for that one long dresses at thirty nine long hair as thirty 31 and then modest clothes has twenty they're about thirty thousand okay this is the question I get asked on all four videos they say I thought God only looks at my heart I thought God doesn't look at my outward appearance in that see and then that kind of slick and that see it see how Satan's working in there it's kind of like Satan he says oh if you turn this bread into a stone you know turn this bread in stone and Jesus has to come back with more word right he said Oh jump off this pinnacle because in Psalms it says if you drop off the pinnacle the angels will pick you up that you don't dash your foot against the stone so see Satan brings us scripture so Jesus got to bring more scripture you shall not tempt the LORD thy God so that's what this that's what this is so Satan tells these people oh God doesn't care about your outward appearance he's just looking at your heart okay who'd like to read that one you got maokai read a 1st samuel 16:7 alright that's slick devil uses this to get people to cut their hair he uses this to get beat women to wear makeup Oh God does how do you know girl Jessica's I talked to them I've talked to him on the phone and I've talked to them on comments on YouTube people have called me from New York some of the Texas different California people have called me we've talked about these on the phone this is what Satan tells these people Oh God doesn't care about your outward appearance he's just looking at your heart as long as you have a good heart well the Bible said your heart is deceitfully wicked above all things who can know it Jeremiah says that the only way to have a clean R is that the Holy Ghost wash out your amen and then if it wash out your heart you believe the Word of God what the Word of God says about these things make up long dresses long hair and modest clothes so anyways I bring three points I bring three reasons why this is the wrong interpretation the first one they're taking this scripture out of context in other words this scripture is not about weight or wearing makeup it's not about long hair it's not about clothing and it's not about long dresses and separation of men and women's garments it's about God choosing a king to replace all that's what it's about it's not about any of those other subjects so they're taking this scripture and applying it to a situation that it doesn't apply to and the church said amen samuel was in Bethlehem at the house of Jesse to anoint the next king of Israel to replace the rebellious saw Samuel looks at Elia ma look at this he's the firstborn he's a monster surely this is God's next preacher surely this is the next King and God has to correct Samuel and said don't look on his height or his countenance he said God it's not looking on his outward appearance God is looking at his heart and what if the Bible say later about David David was a man after the heart of God so God is going to choose someone to lead you and I who has a heart who wants to know the heart of God that's how God chooses leaders there they're the heart their greatest desire in their heart is to know the Heart of Jesus amen in other words to know the will of God so this is totally out of context doesn't even apply to Jezebel doesn't find it it's not even close to applying to Moses and abominations it's applying to the physical king God's not interested in the physical height of King David he's interested in a heart that will not rebel against the Word of God secondly this cannot negate all the other commands for modest clothing like first Timothy 2:9 I would that women dress in modest apparel remember Paul lived a thousand years after Samuel God told Samuel God doesn't look upon the outward appearance he looks at the heart but then a thousand years later God said tell those women to not wear sexy clothes right tell those men tell that maniac of gaturro tell them to get some clothes on that boys run around naked out here with demons right the same Holy Spirit so see that that idea there can't do away with all these other commands about how we present our bodies that's the second reason the first reason it's out of context it doesn't apply to that the second one it can't do away with all the other witnesses so it must be the wrong interpretation of 1st Samuel 16:7 yeah even Paul wrote about hair oh well I can cut my hair God looks at my heart God don't look at the outward appearance well Paul said if you cut it you're a shame woman God said Paul said if you grow up man you're a shame to God you're ashamed of Jesus Christ well it got Christ looking at my heart yes and that leads to my last one the outward appearance often reveals what's in your heart hey man that was my favorite one I like that one that was came to me this morning I mean I've said it before but I thank God he brought it back to me now not always though but most often the outward appearance reveals what is the condition of the heart and I listed three examples three easy for easy examples Cain after God says why don't you just sacrifice blood like your brother the Bible said he got angry and his countenance changed and he left the friends of God so his outward appearance toward God show what was in his heart now that's just your face think about painting your face makeup pride second Saul's count has changed when the evil spirits were on him the Bible said he had a countenance that was troubled he was always troubled and angry and upset when the evil spirits were on him is outward appearance gave away but when the holy when David played the music the Holy Ghost casts out those demons the Bible said he was refreshed and he loved David but when he wasn't when he wasn't anointed the Holy Spirit he hated David and his countenance was one of anger and murder a murdering spirit third the Bible said an evil woman uses a accountants of seductive facial expressions in order to tempt men into acts of adultery and fornication in proverbs 6 24 25 and 26 the Bible said don't he said my son don't let a horse woman take you with her eyes see the outward appearance the outward appearance shows what's in the heart of that the Bible calls her an evil horse woman evil her heart is evil and her outward appearance shows that here I go there was my timer again here I go forgive me I'm almost fourth the maniac for gaturro his outward appearance of being naked that was an obvious sign that he was demon-possessed just like are though the women the actresses today the musicians that go to their award ceremonies and they're half-naked their shows they're filled with demons okay now my last point I want to make is this in Matthew 23 Jesus said the Pharisees indeed are beautiful in their outward appearance so the here's the bounds sometimes your outward appearance can be beautiful and holy what I mean by beautiful is holy think about the Pharisee now think about Muslims many of them dressed very modestly don't think think about those women they cover their hair and which that's up to them or nothing about the Bible about that but they wear modest clothes and aren't tight and they look just as holy as we do if not more but they reject the blood of Jesus Christ is that right and because of that they're full of dead men bones and their only hope for salvation is to do good to a Christian who's saved by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fill with the Holy Spirit their only hope is they could be good to one of Jesus's brethren so that's the balance let's end our feet there that's the bounce you can have a beautiful outward appearance but God still sees the heart so what do we got to have we got to have a beautiful outward appearance and we got to have humble hearts amen we'll close with that by the grace of the Lord well I'm thankful phrase the Lord I'm happy I'm feeling good I feel like I'm almost at the end of I'm almost at the end of this journey here I'm so happy because I remember preaching in the summer like I'm gonna write a book this summer I remember Adam in BO heard it and they smiled and I didn't get to it for a while but now I almost got it and I can say I knew this leading was of the Lord because God's helping me get it done and I wanted to be able to be a blessing and help people if the videos are changing lives and are liberating people saving souls transforming them then I think a book can do the same by God's grace because it's another form or the Holy Spirit can minister to somebody as they focus as they meditate upon the word and how many know to that reading a real book is better than reading online let me know that that's proven that's been taught in our education circles there's something about a book that is more impactful it's more it's it's you learn better and the thing is there's no distractions because here I can get really easily distracted by other popping up and all this stuff and they're always trying to they always say oh this screen is so much more clear it's almost like paper to see they can never they'll never get to the clarity that paper has for our eyes they're there trying to get there but I'll never get because it's not paper it's not it's little pixels there's nothing better than our natural eyes on natural paper there so anyways praise the Lord God is good I'm so glad God aren't you glad God has liberated you aren't you glad got to set you free transform you praise God what a blessing let's just sing a few songs here as we close by the grace of the Lord oh there it is my wife email me it's anthropology sorry the study of humans and that's what that's what master McCrae is an anthropologist that's what it was I knew it started with a thank you honey the texture after service hair that's what it was I was on the tip of my tongue anthro anthropology
