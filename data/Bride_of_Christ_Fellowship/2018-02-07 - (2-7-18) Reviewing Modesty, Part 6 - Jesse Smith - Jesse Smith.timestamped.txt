[5:12] people contacting me three families

[5:22] and but Adam thanks for shoveling the
[5:24] snow appreciate that thank you sir so

[5:29] you guys go into Florida by the way I'm
[5:30] sorry they told me you're going to
[5:32] Florida next week okay they thought it
[5:34] might be this week I was like I don't
[5:35] remember
[5:35] I'll get this tired okay so safe travel
[5:39] for you and sister PO there and I know
[5:44] uh let's see cabin flies out tomorrow
[5:48] and Murray flight out today so we can
[5:50] pray for Kevin she travels some server
[5:53] system reads probably already there
[6:00] also let me just add one more thing in
[6:01] there I'll just pray for some outreach
[6:03] ideas but Adam and I met a few Saturdays
[6:05] ago we're talking about doing some
[6:06] outreach those dates are gonna come up
[6:10] pretty soon my wife said we should
[6:11] expect them any week now as far as when
[6:14] we can rent a booth and you know pass
[6:16] out tracts or show brother branham's
[6:17] videos or our videos or whatever they
[6:20] want to show let's pray that God will
[6:22] lead us to do something like that to
[6:24] reach out to Souls I just got another
[6:27] check in the mail today they want to
[6:29] donate to our ministry for our video so
[6:30] they sent $45 so I said well praise the
[6:34] Lord
[6:35] so anyways we can use that 45 for the
[6:39] renting of the table there we'd like to
[6:41] do that so I like to do that in the
[6:44] spring or summer you know as soon as we
[6:45] can get out there and so my children I
[6:49] told mommy at the wodsworth and the
[6:51] Doylestown I like to rent a table for
[6:53] our church said I can be there the whole
[6:55] day with you guys and pass out tracts
[6:58] and you know show the Bible and
[7:00] everything like that so let's just pray
[7:02] for that I really I've had a burden for
[7:03] that you know of course for a while but
[7:06] finding the time is hard to do but I was
[7:08] encouraged today I was on the way
[7:09] driving thinking about that and I
[7:11] thought well brother branham's doing
[7:13] what I did until he got until he became
[7:15] a full-time evangelist he pastored for
[7:18] 17 years and he didn't go anywhere he
[7:20] just passed her two held meetings but
[7:21] then when the church could support him
[7:23] after 17 years he got on a salary then
[7:26] he just went around the world preaching
[7:28] you know so I thought well I'm doing
[7:30] everything I can do by God's grace
[7:32] trying to balance life and ministry and
[7:35] everything like that I do I do want to
[7:37] pray for that that God will give us
[7:38] wisdom for some outreach by God's grace
[7:41] okay I guess we'll go for Lord in prayer
[7:44] let's go and pray here

[44:42] Lord in their midst Lord Jesus may
[44:45] angels visit each home tonight
[44:47] Lord this church in Jesus Christ's name
[44:50] and the church said amen god bless you
[44:52] didn't see let's get started here so
[44:58] chapter 7 as I said it's called YouTube
[45:02] testimonies and questions and answers so
[45:04] I want to go over this I'm up to 36,000
[45:07] 994 words so I'm very thankful for that
[45:12] and I want to start I just start off the
[45:16] chapter by saying a little bit about
[45:17] YouTube how it's a very popular website
[45:19] and there's more content uploaded on
[45:22] YouTube every day than the first 60
[45:25] years of the broadcasting company oh you
[45:27] put all that video together all the
[45:30] gigabytes there's more put on YouTube in
[45:32] like one week than the previous 60 years
[45:35] from the beginning of television because
[45:38] it's just expanding so so much but I I
[45:43] just use some scriptures to show that
[45:45] YouTube should be used as a tool for
[45:47] Christians but they should never set
[45:49] anything wicked before their eyes
[45:51] according to Saul
[45:51] 101 verse three David said I was sent in
[45:54] a wicked thing before my eyes I hate the
[45:57] work of them that turn aside it shall
[45:59] not cleave to me so you know back in
[46:05] 2004 I received the message in 2001 but
[46:09] in 2004 brother Brooks did a community
[46:12] Jubilee in Lima and it was like a summer
[46:15] event of two days it was a two day event
[46:18] and he did it two summers in a row he
[46:20] did it in 2004-2005 and for those two
[46:24] events we just come in the message and
[46:26] we're really on fire and loving
[46:28] everything and for those two events I
[46:31] just had this desire to make gospel
[46:34] materials in other words to put the the
[46:36] message on video and the message on
[46:38] paper so what we did is I asked brother
[46:41] Brooks if we could have a special
[46:43] service and so I we had a special
[46:46] Saturday service and I preached on how
[46:47] TV is the unclean thing I preached on
[46:49] television the unclean thing and brother
[46:51] brother vang was brother banging me
[46:54] brother banging brother John I think
[46:55] recorded the video and the audio and
[46:57] they made a DVD and I think the DVD is
[47:00] actually out there on the shelf back
[47:02] from 2005 I think 2005 if I'm not
[47:04] mistaken and then brother Craig asked by
[47:06] his brother Craig if he would do a video
[47:08] and he preached on I think it's out
[47:09] there too about the wheat and the tares
[47:10] I believe he taught on that or every
[47:13] scene must bring forth of its own kind
[47:15] and so we started making gospel
[47:17] materials and that was like the
[47:20] beginning of just my desire to get the
[47:23] Word of God out in a different format
[47:24] now I believe this like we preached in
[47:26] the Philadelphia Church age the the main
[47:29] way to get the gospel out is through the
[47:31] preaching of the word live preaching is
[47:34] God's intended away to get the word out
[47:37] but like brother Graham said there's
[47:38] forms there's different forms of the
[47:40] gospel like there's printing Bibles
[47:42] there's passing out Bibles he said
[47:44] there's passing out tracts whatever form
[47:47] the gospel goes in its brother Graham
[47:50] said it's a fine thing it's a good thing
[47:52] but the main thing is for people to come
[47:54] to church and hear the gospel preached
[47:57] amen
[47:57] that's what we got to get that's what
[48:00] we've got to Ernest Lee contend for so
[48:02] if like for example if we do if we do
[48:05] outreach
[48:05] you know and a fare something like that
[48:08] or if we do postcards whatever we do
[48:11] we've got to try to get people to come
[48:12] here the Word of God because in this
[48:15] presence we know where the presence of
[48:17] Jesus Christ is they can feel God's
[48:20] presence and they can be convicted by
[48:22] the Holy Spirit and they can like the
[48:24] Bible said they can have the secrets of
[48:26] their hearts revealed by the Holy Spirit
[48:27] and then they'll know that God is here
[48:30] that's what the Bible says in first
[48:31] Corinthians 14 it's so important to get
[48:34] people here in the seats and the nice
[48:36] thing is we got plenty of seats so we
[48:39] want to do that like I said but we need
[48:41] the timing I need the time I need the
[48:43] energy and the resources I just I've
[48:45] kind of put that off I haven't you know
[48:47] when you have to prepare three sermons a
[48:48] week I just haven't had as much time to
[48:50] devote to that like I like to and I've
[48:53] had this great burden as well I think I
[48:55] think having a book and +50 YouTube
[48:57] videos I think that will be a lot for
[48:58] penny if anyone new comes I think it'd
[49:00] be great as a resource to show to them
[49:02] and give them right away we got the
[49:04] church age books out there and the
[49:05] message books we want to have plenty of
[49:07] material but the main thing to do the
[49:10] ultimate goal is to get people into the
[49:14] service so they can sense the presence
[49:16] of the Holy Ghost be convicted and get
[49:19] saved and then hopefully get sanctified
[49:21] and get filled with the Holy Ghost
[49:22] that's the most important thing but
[49:24] remember even those little brother
[49:25] branham cards that we used to have out
[49:26] there brother mike dirnt all from lima
[49:29] picked up one of those and he left his
[49:31] homosexual lifestyle and came to the
[49:33] message just from a card he he mailed
[49:37] voice of God they sent that the books
[49:39] back he said where's the church that
[49:41] preaches us and he drove to Lima all
[49:43] those years and became a real saint of
[49:46] God amen and he still he's the first one
[49:48] of the church he opens a church every
[49:50] time he closed the church he's a
[49:52] faithful man of God amen so see that God
[49:55] can use any form and we just want to be
[49:58] faithful now after we started the church
[50:00] John brother John Graham did a
[50:03] tremendous job with gospel materials
[50:06] printing I don't know if sister Beau
[50:07] remembers at her I know
[50:09] bang wood but John we bought a laser
[50:11] printer and then we brought bought a
[50:12] lathe to print paper then we bought a
[50:14] laser printer to to print color
[50:19] labels on DVDs and so we had the
[50:22] top-of-the-line and I think we might do
[50:23] that again Lord willing we'll see so we
[50:26] could make the highest quality DVDs and
[50:29] and CDs and we distributed many of those
[50:31] we share them with different churches
[50:33] and mailed them out to people who
[50:36] ordered them we try to make as many
[50:38] copies as we could but you know as the
[50:41] years went by you know our families grew
[50:43] and jobs required more of us and I you
[50:46] know I was doing my graduate work and
[50:48] John started working more hours you know
[50:51] and so we we stopped that ministry we
[50:54] just had enough time for but you know
[50:56] that burden to take the gospel never
[50:59] left me so in 24 2013 I started
[51:02] tinkering with oh I could do video
[51:04] editing because I started to bet editing
[51:06] videos for my school ID edit videos and
[51:09] make slideshows of our pictures and so
[51:11] huh I thought well maybe I can do that
[51:13] for the gospel so I started researching
[51:15] on how to make videos that's when I
[51:16] bought the green screen and the cameras
[51:19] and and that's when I made my first
[51:22] video water baptism in the name of the
[51:24] Lord Jesus and that was in 2014 I
[51:28] finally posted one on the Internet but I
[51:30] put out on Vimeo because I was scared I
[51:31] might get backlash on YouTube I was kind
[51:34] of scared and I look back now and I
[51:37] should not have been fearful but I was
[51:39] fearful I thought people might get upset
[51:41] I thought I might lose my job if people
[51:43] found out you know that what I believed
[51:45] but since you know I have numerous
[51:48] people have found out and they just just
[51:50] kind of say well that's just Jesse I
[51:51] guess but I was fearful so I just put on
[51:53] you or Vimeo because I knew there was
[51:55] less people on Vimeo after and after two
[52:00] years I'm sorry I sure AM it's just
[52:08] really grown since then we have over
[52:10] 240,000 views and over 2400 subscribers
[52:13] since then and and now we're able to
[52:19] just basically put anything on there we
[52:22] like to do but since then
[52:25] come compile many testimonies I wanna
[52:27] read a few testimonies
[52:28] here's one from overseas this brother
[52:30] never left me a name but he said your
[52:32] videos play a huge role in my life I've
[52:34] got no words to say I become speechless
[52:37] about your help I think I better say I
[52:39] love you my pastor now I hope you
[52:42] understand I'm not as pastor but that
[52:45] was a nice encouraging comment there
[52:48] from a foreigner that's just about the
[52:49] overall videos in general now remember
[52:51] these are testimonies are important
[52:53] because the Bible said we overcome Satan
[52:55] by the blood of the Lamb and by the word
[52:56] of our testimony so we've got to have
[52:58] some testimony at some point saying
[53:01] where this really encouraged me or this
[53:02] is when God spoke to me you know I was
[53:05] encouraged last week at middle school
[53:07] Bible Club one of the parents raised her
[53:09] hand said mr. Smith can I share this
[53:10] real quick and I said sure he said you
[53:12] know all of us have heard the voice of
[53:14] God who had been saved and he said he
[53:17] said think about it what caused you to
[53:19] repent and get baptized you heard the
[53:21] voice of God now how did you hear it is
[53:23] your audible voice maybe not but what
[53:26] did you hear you heard God's voice you
[53:28] who you felt God's conviction on your
[53:30] heart saying I need to repent I need to
[53:32] clean up my life I'm I'm ashamed of my
[53:35] sin I want to repent and be baptized in
[53:37] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so
[53:40] that was such an encouragement you know
[53:41] and that's how the YouTube videos work
[53:44] as well we might not have heard an
[53:46] audible voice saying you need to go get
[53:48] baptized on this day and you know
[53:50] February 7 2018 we might not hear that
[53:53] but we hear conviction we hear we feel
[53:56] the pole as brother Branham says the
[53:57] Bible we feel the pull and that proves
[54:00] we've heard the voice of God now we have
[54:02] to take that same thought and apply it
[54:05] to tonight's service right and apply it
[54:07] to Sunday service or tomorrow morning
[54:09] when we read our Bible we've got to take
[54:12] that same thought lord help me to feel
[54:14] your voice or feel your conviction like
[54:16] I felt when I got saved and that by
[54:20] doing that we can keep ourselves
[54:21] sensitive to the voice of God so that's
[54:28] why these testimonies are so important
[54:29] I'm gonna read this one again just
[54:30] because maybe some of our lives she was
[54:32] in here but a couple months ago a person
[54:34] said the video on the Lord Jesus
[54:37] Christ's baptism saved
[54:38] their soul I said your YouTube channel
[54:41] not only helped me to know God better
[54:42] but also guided me to follow God's will
[54:44] hopefully the videos will save and help
[54:46] a lot more lost souls like me thank you
[54:49] for making these videos you saved my
[54:51] soul that was from November 2017 this
[54:55] one was popular about make up it said I
[54:58] fasted three days and asked God to show
[55:00] me about makeup and I just opened my
[55:02] YouTube and here you are talking about
[55:03] makeup it was amazing
[55:05] God answered my prayer many thanks
[55:07] brother you really helped me I'll share
[55:09] this video with other sisters three days
[55:11] fasting to know about makeup this one is
[55:14] uh these next ones are about makeup here
[55:15] these next few about makeup this says
[55:20] thank you for making this video help me
[55:22] to realize there's no such thing as
[55:24] modest makeup you ever heard that I'm
[55:26] gonna use makeup in a modest way and the
[55:28] individual realized by the help of the
[55:30] Holy Spirit there's no such thing as
[55:32] modest makeup even though there are
[55:35] churches twisting Bible verses to keep
[55:37] their members another one says I'm not
[55:40] wearing makeup no more another one says
[55:43] I'm throwing away my makeup another one
[55:46] says thank you for this video I don't
[55:48] wear a lot of makeup but I'm completely
[55:50] done with what I was using amen
[55:56] okay now this one I think this goes to
[55:58] oh no this is still a makeup okay the
[56:03] argument you made based entirely on
[56:05] God's holy and perfect word has
[56:08] convinced me to stop wearing makeup I
[56:10] love that all right all the videos we do
[56:13] we never try to do just say brother
[56:14] branham said brother branham said
[56:15] brother ram said we try to show them the
[56:17] scriptures that brother branham said
[56:19] point them to the Word of God that our
[56:22] prophet brought out and then they said
[56:25] could you please
[56:25] I would deeply and greatly appreciate if
[56:28] you could do us more videos addressing
[56:31] if wise virgins should wear trousers
[56:34] women should wear trousers or should
[56:37] wear jewelry or whether we should hide
[56:39] all of our legs or not so I pointed them
[56:41] to the video I already had on long
[56:43] dresses in the Bible and now I can point
[56:46] that individual to this book once we get
[56:48] it done by God's grace
[56:51] this is a really good one this is from a
[56:53] woman named Gail she emails me all the
[56:55] time
[56:55] Washington all the time every now and
[56:57] then email me repeatedly she said after
[57:00] I watching your video I was a makeup
[57:03] guru before your video I love how I
[57:06] could transform and look like somebody
[57:08] else and that's so sick like just that's
[57:10] what I brother Ram said people are
[57:11] insane and I'm not I'm not bashing this
[57:14] woman you understand I'm not master but
[57:16] like what what kind of thought process
[57:19] would you have to have where you'd say I
[57:21] want to transform I don't want to be
[57:23] what God made me to be shouldn't we have
[57:25] enough faith and love for God that he
[57:27] made us the way he wanted us to be
[57:28] shouldn't we have such love and trust
[57:31] and just have unwavering faith that I am
[57:34] what God wanted me to be amen one
[57:39] morning shortly after I saw your video
[57:41] God said skip make up this morning and
[57:43] spend the extra time with me and she
[57:47] said I obeyed and I loved it little by
[57:50] little makeup became less and less
[57:52] attractive sometimes it wouldn't even go
[57:55] on right and have to wash it all off I
[57:57] like that I like when the when Satan's
[57:59] plans get messed up hallelujah
[58:03] and every day I noticed how in the
[58:04] evening as it was wearing off my face
[58:07] look worse than it did without any
[58:09] makeup on hey men see Church do you see
[58:12] how God's trying to give her the eye
[58:14] salve of the Holy Spirit before she all
[58:17] she saw with her eyes was all I look
[58:18] prettier with makeup but once the Holy
[58:20] Spirit brings conviction it puts ice out
[58:23] on her eyes and she can see what she
[58:25] really is according to God's Word she's
[58:28] ugly with makeup on that's exactly right
[58:31] then one day I was reading the scripture
[58:33] and the thought came to me and said why
[58:34] do you paint your face to gain men's
[58:37] approval and then she said after that I
[58:40] stopped wearing makeup cold turkey I
[58:42] felt naked and self-conscious at first
[58:45] but now I've gone about two months
[58:46] without it and I don't miss it I don't
[58:49] feel naked without it
[58:50] either I don't get it near the
[58:53] compliments from men or women I used to
[58:55] but that's okay because that would lead
[58:57] me down a wrong path anyway see the
[59:00] reason this woman put it on was to get
[59:02] compliments from people see that's pride
[59:05] wants people's attention for the wrong
[59:07] reason not the right reason to glorify
[59:10] herself instead of glorifying Christ
[59:13] alright and I and she's the emailed
[59:15] numerous times over the last few years
[59:16] and thankful for the victories there now
[59:21] let's go on these fewer about long
[59:22] dresses in the Bible that video I think
[59:24] it's got thirty-nine thousand yeah it's
[59:27] got thirty-nine thousand views this
[59:29] woman said I've been struggling for many
[59:30] years regarding my wardrobe
[59:33] finally I'm sorry I listened to so many
[59:35] opinions
[59:36] finally I picked up my phone and began
[59:38] the internet search and I came across
[59:40] you pastor after listening the message I
[59:43] cleaned out my closet completely I'd
[59:45] like to thank you for clarifying the
[59:47] importance of dressing modestly I'm
[59:51] really grateful to God and to this
[59:52] ministry for today I can say I no longer
[59:55] wish to dress as I did but according to
[59:58] the Bible hey hallelujah I love it
[1:00:01] two days later she wrote how she shared
[1:00:03] it with friends and her and her friends
[1:00:05] were going to the local goodwill she
[1:00:08] said I want to thank you for the impact
[1:00:10] this video has had upon my life she said
[1:00:12] praise God God never fails amen
[1:00:15] hallelujah
[1:00:18] this one says I watched your video many
[1:00:20] months ago but your message left a seed
[1:00:23] inside of my soul I love that a seed of
[1:00:25] the word so that member goes back to the
[1:00:27] four types of ground that seeds fall on
[1:00:29] this must have been a at least a good
[1:00:31] ground or maybe it's a ground that's the
[1:00:34] third kind of ground I would get choked
[1:00:36] by the things of the world we'll see
[1:00:37] we'll see on the day judgment I've been
[1:00:40] wearing skirts and dresses for the last
[1:00:42] few months and I feel liberated look at
[1:00:44] that and then Jesus say he whom the Sun
[1:00:46] is set free is free indeed hallelujah I
[1:00:50] cannot go back to wearing pants because
[1:00:52] the Holy Ghost makes me feel dirty when
[1:00:54] I do it look at that thank you put it
[1:00:57] for putting this profound message on the
[1:00:59] internet now it's not me that's profound
[1:01:01] it's God's Word that's profound it's
[1:01:04] profound it blows your your mind it
[1:01:06] illuminates your mind it transform your
[1:01:09] mind like the Bible said by the
[1:01:11] transforming of your mind be renewed by
[1:01:13] the transformation of your mind
[1:01:15] hallelujah I
[1:01:18] of testimonies like this long let's do
[1:01:23] some long hair in the Bible testimonies
[1:01:26] thank you brother Smith this was a
[1:01:27] blessing to me and I fully understand
[1:01:29] now that should not even trim my hair
[1:01:32] another one says thank you for this
[1:01:34] message before I used to cut my hair
[1:01:36] like a boy but I will never my life cut
[1:01:38] my hair again now I know it's against
[1:01:41] God's Word thank you so much man of God
[1:01:43] that was really nice say that I said
[1:01:46] you're not far from the kingdom see cos
[1:01:49] now if she don't cut her hair now she
[1:01:50] can reverence her husband before she
[1:01:53] couldn't do that
[1:01:54] she brought shame to herself she brought
[1:01:56] dishonor to herself and dishonored to
[1:01:58] her husband but now she's closer to the
[1:02:00] kingdom of God I watched your videos on
[1:02:05] YouTube about modest clothing okay I
[1:02:08] must have mixed up
[1:02:08] oh no okay this is the model yeah we
[1:02:10] those I only did two hair video
[1:02:12] testimonies and these are modest
[1:02:13] clothing it said immediately after
[1:02:16] watching your video I was aware that I
[1:02:17] need to make adjustments on the clothing
[1:02:19] that I currently own I'm so blessed to
[1:02:21] have come across your channel by the way
[1:02:23] another one says thank you for
[1:02:25] delivering your message in a kind loving
[1:02:27] way it's confirmation
[1:02:29] I actually just asked God how do you
[1:02:32] want me to dress then I stumble on your
[1:02:34] video glory to God I like this real
[1:02:38] short but says thank you dear I'm
[1:02:40] transformed hey and that was on the four
[1:02:44] guidelines for modest clothing I'm
[1:02:46] transformed that's what Romans 12:1 and
[1:02:48] 2 says be transformed by the renewing of
[1:02:51] your mind ok let's go over some
[1:02:54] frequently asked questions that I get
[1:02:57] for each one of these some of them I
[1:03:00] already went I'm sorry one of them
[1:03:01] already went over for makeup I had three
[1:03:05] questions the first ones about Esther
[1:03:06] I'm not gonna go over that one because
[1:03:08] we've covered that when we went over
[1:03:09] Esther she's never given cosmetics she
[1:03:11] was given oils for her skin and maybe
[1:03:14] face you know but it wouldn't be makeup
[1:03:16] it would just be oils to make her skin
[1:03:18] clean um the second one is on acne a
[1:03:23] makeup to cover acne or scars which I
[1:03:28] thought was a really good question
[1:03:29] Oh
[1:03:32] ask is that literally a sin to wear
[1:03:34] makeup so here's my answers are you
[1:03:36] ready for questions and answers okay the
[1:03:39] first one is Esther second one is what
[1:03:41] about someone a lady who has defects
[1:03:44] like acne scars or other scars from an
[1:03:47] accident or surgery or a bad burn that
[1:03:50] can be covered with full cover
[1:03:51] foundation the woman says a little blush
[1:03:56] come on what if it's about if it's your
[1:03:59] daughter your wife with aging spots
[1:04:00] feeling ugly in front of you see how
[1:04:04] she's working on your emotions what
[1:04:05] about it's your hunter what about you
[1:04:08] know it's just come on just a little
[1:04:10] blush what do you think my answer was
[1:04:13] what do you think I said a little leaven
[1:04:16] leavens the whole lump
[1:04:18] now church I don't laugh I'm not
[1:04:20] laughing at I'm just laughing at that
[1:04:22] comment because I think that's the right
[1:04:23] Bible answer like it's the wisdom of God
[1:04:25] a little blush a little leaven leavens
[1:04:28] the whole lump but what I said is I'm
[1:04:30] very sensitive I said I'm sorry about
[1:04:32] any accidents or surgeries or burns you
[1:04:34] may have had but I said I would
[1:04:38] encourage those with scars or accidents
[1:04:42] or burns to seek God about this topic
[1:04:44] because we know God never changes it
[1:04:47] would seem God would give all them the
[1:04:48] same answer makeup as a heathen trait
[1:04:50] and if people see their scars or things
[1:04:54] marks or burns and said that could be
[1:04:56] used for a testimony like for example my
[1:04:58] mom got burnt when I was growing up she
[1:05:01] had a oil fire she was burning oil on
[1:05:04] the stove and had a literal fire at our
[1:05:06] upstairs home and it she tried to put it
[1:05:10] out with water and that's like the word
[1:05:11] and I didn't know that you know I
[1:05:12] wouldn't I would done the same thing I
[1:05:15] never had training on fires you know but
[1:05:18] she just tried to put out water and it
[1:05:20] exploded and went all over her arm into
[1:05:23] this day she still has a huge scar but
[1:05:25] anyway she was able just to use that as
[1:05:27] a testimony instead of trying to you
[1:05:29] know cover this over I have surgery
[1:05:30] she's used that as a testimony like me
[1:05:33] and my me and my ignorance almost blew
[1:05:37] up my entire home but God had mercy on
[1:05:40] me and spared me from death now someone
[1:05:43] who's got a burn on their face you know
[1:05:45] and might it might make them feel an
[1:05:47] awkward but remember there guy there's
[1:05:49] got to be a testimony behind it if
[1:05:50] you're still alive you've still got
[1:05:53] grace right you've still got an
[1:05:54] opportunity to show grace or to receive
[1:05:57] the grace of God and all these little
[1:06:00] things can be all those little things
[1:06:02] with all the all the scars or all the
[1:06:04] burns or the surgeries can all be ways
[1:06:07] to share about God like yeah I did have
[1:06:09] to have the surgery but thank God this
[1:06:11] and this and this didn't happen as well
[1:06:14] now for acne I can use my own testimony
[1:06:18] when I eat too much sugar or when I used
[1:06:21] to drink pop or when I wouldn't sleep
[1:06:23] well I got a lot of acne and so the
[1:06:26] people that I've shared this with
[1:06:27] they've actually responded and say
[1:06:29] you're right my acne instead of using
[1:06:31] makeup to cover it up I need to change
[1:06:33] my diet I need to change my sleeping
[1:06:36] habits now that's not forever but I know
[1:06:38] some people have acne and it might be
[1:06:40] uncontrollable but there's usually
[1:06:43] something you can do when it comes to
[1:06:46] acne from at least from what I've heard
[1:06:47] I'm not a doctor we'd have to ask
[1:06:49] brother Scott or somebody else who knows
[1:06:50] but I just know in my personal
[1:06:52] experience if I eat right and drink
[1:06:54] water and get good enough sleep I don't
[1:06:56] get acne but when I eat sugar don't
[1:06:58] sleep and don't drink enough water I'm
[1:07:00] gonna get acne and so a couple people
[1:07:03] did respond and say that they they felt
[1:07:05] the same thing about that now if you're
[1:07:07] feeling if you're getting older and you
[1:07:09] see aging spots just let the glory of
[1:07:11] God light your face just be anointed
[1:07:13] with the love of God listen we're all
[1:07:14] gonna get old brother branham said it's
[1:07:17] a shame that people program said they
[1:07:19] want to look back in the rearview mirror
[1:07:20] and try to live what they were when they
[1:07:22] were 20 years old
[1:07:23] he said you shouldn't do that he said
[1:07:26] because if you stare in your rear-view
[1:07:26] mirror you're gonna get an accident by
[1:07:28] what's in front of you you're missing
[1:07:30] what's in front of you by staring in the
[1:07:32] rearview mirror too long they said
[1:07:34] you're gonna get an accident and that's
[1:07:37] what all these I think I just saw Jane
[1:07:38] Fonda just put out a book right and she
[1:07:40] was this seductress from the 70s she's
[1:07:44] 70 years old and she has so many
[1:07:45] surgeries she's just still trying to
[1:07:48] seduce people still after all these
[1:07:50] years she's trying to get rid of all
[1:07:52] these wrinkles but she got wrinkles no
[1:07:53] wrinkles here but she's got wrinkles on
[1:07:55] her neck like what see it's just a
[1:07:58] spirit they just were there just a lust
[1:08:01] and they know that if they're trying to
[1:08:02] be sexy they can try to make more money
[1:08:04] and they should just cast that down and
[1:08:06] don't put anything on except the glory
[1:08:08] of God amen so I said that I said I know
[1:08:11] that see that may seem harsh but we
[1:08:14] shouldn't wear makeup any under
[1:08:15] condition because we must obey Jesus
[1:08:18] based upon our love and His Holy Bible
[1:08:20] you said a little blush but to me I
[1:08:23] respectfully say a little leaven leavens
[1:08:25] the hold up a little bit of sin is still
[1:08:27] sin I said we must not love the things
[1:08:31] of the world okay and then the question
[1:08:33] three they asked me straight out is
[1:08:34] wearing makeup a sin and I said yes and
[1:08:37] my scripture to prove that is Jeremiah
[1:08:41] 10 - let's read that you got your Bible
[1:08:42] Jeremiah 10 - now it doesn't
[1:08:45] specifically say those that paint their
[1:08:49] faces are sinning but it does say not to
[1:08:54] learn the ways of the heathen Jeremiah
[1:08:57] 10 - and this is the chapter that has
[1:08:59] the supposed Christmas trees in it but
[1:09:01] member I kind of preach on that with
[1:09:02] Christian Liberty I don't I don't know
[1:09:05] if you can really say this is a
[1:09:06] Christmas tree it looks a lot like it
[1:09:08] and to me it's it's close enough where
[1:09:11] I'm not going to put up a tree in my
[1:09:13] house but if people want to that's fine
[1:09:16] that's between them and God if that
[1:09:18] makes them closer to God fine or if it
[1:09:21] has to no it has no impact and it's just
[1:09:23] a neutral like a Christian Liberty like
[1:09:26] eating meat or eating herbs or
[1:09:27] vegetarian fine you can be happy just
[1:09:32] thank the Lord right that's a no matter
[1:09:33] if you do it or don't do it just thank
[1:09:35] the Lord praise God that's the main
[1:09:37] thing thank God okay verse 1 here you
[1:09:41] the word which the Lord speaking on you
[1:09:42] o house of Israel thus saith the Lord
[1:09:44] learn not the way of the heathen and be
[1:09:46] not dismayed at the signs of heaven for
[1:09:49] the heathen are dismayed at them now he
[1:09:51] goes and lists this issue about cutting
[1:09:54] down the tree but I would be I would
[1:09:58] agree and I'm sure you would too that
[1:09:59] any key than sinful act would be a sin
[1:10:03] and who is the first person who is the
[1:10:06] originator of makeup wearing the history
[1:10:09] says Jezebel the history says we're
[1:10:11] actually from the people I've read
[1:10:12] different preachers I've heard that of
[1:10:14] read history say that Jezebel actually
[1:10:16] had it before the Egyptians I don't know
[1:10:18] if that's true but that's what I was
[1:10:20] told because of this that's saying where
[1:10:24] it says you're painting up your face
[1:10:25] like a Jezebel you know things like that
[1:10:28] so Jezebel her father was a heathen King
[1:10:33] I forget the actual name of it I can't
[1:10:36] think of it now can't think of it now
[1:10:40] there's a some ight he was ight it's in
[1:10:43] first Kings 16 I know that for sure cuz
[1:10:46] Jezebel or a hab starts with Elijah in
[1:10:48] chapter 17 I can't remember it many ways
[1:10:53] she she learned her heathen ways from
[1:10:56] her father
[1:10:56] her father was a murderer the Bible says
[1:10:59] that and then she becomes a murder
[1:11:01] because he then's when they worship they
[1:11:04] would sacrifice human beings and so she
[1:11:07] must have learned that from her heathen
[1:11:09] worship and then of course when it comes
[1:11:11] to her day of judgment she no ji who is
[1:11:13] gonna try to come kill her what'd she do
[1:11:15] she paints her face in defiance and
[1:11:17] tries to put the blame on ji who
[1:11:19] remember that so didn't armour you do
[1:11:21] the same thing you're gonna be just like
[1:11:22] Omri there's our Zimri did you come up
[1:11:26] Lydia did you pull that up okay it's
[1:11:29] chapter 6 it's at the end of chapter 16
[1:11:31] but you can keep looking though just
[1:11:33] raise your hand when you let it let me
[1:11:34] get that now like the woman a row that
[1:11:37] Gayle woman nice woman go to proverbs
[1:11:40] 616 let's go to proverbs 616 this so if
[1:11:44] you put a couple scriptures together you
[1:11:46] can see the sin behind wearing makeup
[1:11:48] it's pride its seduction its lust but
[1:11:53] definitely pride as this one woman was
[1:11:56] actually on and honest enough to admit
[1:11:58] it was pride she wanted to get people's
[1:12:00] attention she wanted people to think she
[1:12:02] was pretty she wanted to create a new
[1:12:04] face to get more attention the does
[1:12:07] Adoni ins thank you very much the donee
[1:12:09] is not heights but maybe it's a Donen
[1:12:11] the dough nights I don't know is that a
[1:12:13] word I don't know proverbs 6 16 and 17
[1:12:17] but the zidonians I I could look it up I
[1:12:19] did look it up I preached on it I just
[1:12:21] forgot we could look up and see the
[1:12:23] actual heathen gods that they worshipped
[1:12:25] proverbs 616 and 70s anyone read that
[1:12:28] for me
[1:12:28] Adam thank you mother Q read 16 and 17
[1:12:43] all right yeah we can stop right there
[1:12:45] it goes on to say a few more but what
[1:12:47] these things these seven things God
[1:12:50] hates the first one is a proud look and
[1:12:52] isn't makeup wearing they paint their
[1:12:55] eyes and like cats and or whatever they
[1:12:58] do
[1:12:58] isn't that a pride is that issue of
[1:13:00] pride because they don't think they're
[1:13:03] pretty enough because they're influenced
[1:13:05] by whatever TV shows are watching or
[1:13:07] movies or their family and they feel
[1:13:09] like they've got to make themselves
[1:13:10] prettier but that's pride that's not
[1:13:14] humility that's exalting yourself above
[1:13:16] other people right I'm gonna be more
[1:13:18] pretty as even exalting you're trying to
[1:13:20] make yourself greater than yourself you
[1:13:21] know then your natural self we'd say God
[1:13:25] hates a proud look and then no doubt
[1:13:30] Jezebel shed innocent blood as well so
[1:13:32] Jezebel did numerous of these
[1:13:34] abominations all right awful so see
[1:13:37] that's what I told the individual when
[1:13:39] you paint your face it's a sin because
[1:13:42] it's usually either press either pride
[1:13:43] motivating it or lust it's one it's got
[1:13:45] to be one of those you don't feel good
[1:13:47] about yourself your self esteems down
[1:13:49] and I hate to say like that but our
[1:13:52] esteem should not our esteem should not
[1:13:54] be in self our esteem should be in God
[1:13:56] amen
[1:13:57] our God esteem you know we should we
[1:13:59] should feel good about God the only way
[1:14:01] we feel good about ourselves is when we
[1:14:02] see Christ in us amen crucifying the
[1:14:05] flesh you know baying the Holy Spirit
[1:14:07] that's what you feel good about
[1:14:08] ourselves I thank God that I thank God
[1:14:11] that he's helped me to overcome myself
[1:14:13] and crucify my flesh okay next one now
[1:14:19] these are neck those are the three on
[1:14:21] make up let's go to long dresses and the
[1:14:23] Bible questions they said brother Jesse
[1:14:26] when did this rule too for women to wear
[1:14:30] pants I'm sorry not wear pants
[1:14:32] originated because she said both men and
[1:14:34] women wore robes in the Bible now that's
[1:14:36] true they both did wear robes but I
[1:14:38] found that the his
[1:14:39] three and I preach on it women women
[1:14:42] their garments went all the way down to
[1:14:43] the ground so you could tell right away
[1:14:45] a man's went somewhere past the knee
[1:14:47] okay and a man actually actually had an
[1:14:50] extra cloak upon him his outer garment
[1:14:53] was different I went to a Jewish website
[1:14:55] it's called Hebrew - was it history or
[1:15:01] origins or org it's a nice organization
[1:15:05] of Jews and they actually show a picture
[1:15:07] of what the different garments are so a
[1:15:09] man and I just saw this a man in his
[1:15:12] outer garment was called the cloak and
[1:15:13] his cloak was like a long jacket like a
[1:15:16] trench coat we know what a trend you
[1:15:17] guys know what a trench coat is it's a
[1:15:19] long coat it's really long it goes like
[1:15:21] down past the knees and so he had the
[1:15:24] man had numerous garments on but his
[1:15:25] outer garment was like a trench coat and
[1:15:27] it was split so you could pull it apart
[1:15:30] like Peter took off his outer garment to
[1:15:31] go fishing but the woman's our outer
[1:15:34] garment could not be taken off it was
[1:15:36] not cut down the middle it was just a
[1:15:39] full garment like a full dress okay and
[1:15:42] that was a really good thought there
[1:15:44] because Jesus said if a man asks for
[1:15:47] your coat give him your cloak also
[1:15:49] so Jesus talks about that how a man
[1:15:51] would have numerous garments numerous
[1:15:53] layers and of course the woman would
[1:15:55] have you know a tunic layer but then she
[1:15:57] also had another outer garment layer but
[1:15:59] it was not split down the middle so you
[1:16:01] could tell right away you could tell by
[1:16:03] looking at a man that's a man he's got
[1:16:05] the cloak on you could tell a woman
[1:16:07] she's got this full garment down it's
[1:16:09] not split down the middle doesn't button
[1:16:11] up it's just a full garment so next time
[1:16:13] you watch a movie about the days of
[1:16:15] Jesus look for those that's I've seen
[1:16:17] him before I've seen that in movies
[1:16:20] where the woman had doesn't have her
[1:16:22] garment is not like an outer coat sound
[1:16:24] like a coat it's just just one long
[1:16:26] garment I'll have to find a movie there
[1:16:28] so to kind of prove that that'd be good
[1:16:32] I know I've seen him before
[1:16:34] let me set my timer I don't want to go
[1:16:36] too late last time I've been going so
[1:16:38] late here my wife gently reminds me I'm
[1:16:44] trying to go a little less here just
[1:16:45] let's go so long okay so I told this
[1:16:49] woman those facts about cokes and
[1:16:52] clothes
[1:16:53] cloaks as soon as you look you could
[1:16:54] tell the difference on first glance oh
[1:16:56] that's a man that's a woman by the outer
[1:16:58] garment but I said as far as when pants
[1:17:02] came in from my study of history which I
[1:17:04] was more limited I'm not a fashion
[1:17:07] historian like at the University or
[1:17:11] something like that
[1:17:13] what's the study of humans called anyway
[1:17:14] what's that called there's on the tip of
[1:17:16] my tongue
[1:17:17] I thought Bao Zhi was study of life like
[1:17:21] all kinds of life what there's a a word
[1:17:23] I could ask Siri but I'm not gonna do it
[1:17:25] during the service there's no I don't
[1:17:28] think it's Anatomy that I'm sorry
[1:17:29] there's this as a word I can D given
[1:17:33] right now the study of humans it's so
[1:17:35] like the people who would have a degree
[1:17:37] in social studies would have they'd have
[1:17:40] this ology I forget what it is I have to
[1:17:42] look it up after the after the service
[1:17:44] sorry but there's an and mat mrs. master
[1:17:46] McCrae Malakai she's that's her job
[1:17:48] that's a wife - ask her tomorrow she
[1:17:50] would tell us she's told me before it's
[1:17:52] something with the AIDS bugging me sorry
[1:17:55] so I'm not one of those like our friends
[1:17:59] the McRae's but I found in the 1600s men
[1:18:03] started wearing pants in the 1600s so
[1:18:06] those robes eventually kind of came up
[1:18:10] and then the breach is underneath got
[1:18:12] longer so that's what we found at least
[1:18:14] with the European history and I don't
[1:18:16] know about Asian history I don't know
[1:18:17] about African history I don't know how
[1:18:19] but with European history which led of
[1:18:22] course you know our founding fathers you
[1:18:24] know to the North America here their
[1:18:27] breeches would became longer and then
[1:18:30] their robes came up and then then they
[1:18:33] had a separate that a separate church
[1:18:34] and then separate breeches which the
[1:18:36] breeches now became pants that was in
[1:18:38] the 1600s but I just reminded this
[1:18:41] individual through this through the
[1:18:43] entire history of the Bible so from 1300
[1:18:46] BC when God told Moses Deuteronomy 22:5
[1:18:49] it's abomination for a woman to put on a
[1:18:52] man's garment from 1300 BC all the way
[1:18:55] to today the true believers Jews or
[1:18:58] Christians have always had two separate
[1:18:59] garments for men and women always and
[1:19:01] you can prove that because Jesus obeyed
[1:19:03] Deuteronomy 22:5 Paul would have obeyed
[1:19:06] it and
[1:19:06] George Washington obeyed it Lincoln
[1:19:09] obeyed it all those guys obeyed it so
[1:19:12] that that's that's this that's the
[1:19:14] principle so it doesn't have to be pants
[1:19:17] and skirts that that's just for our
[1:19:20] culture so that's what I tell them as
[1:19:21] well if you live in a different culture
[1:19:23] we're like India where they have
[1:19:24] different male-female garments will then
[1:19:26] praise the Lord the main thing is God
[1:19:28] doesn't want confusion coming into this
[1:19:31] society and that's what we have here in
[1:19:32] America because of cross-dressing so I
[1:19:36] spend and then of course referenced
[1:19:38] Bruce Jenner he's the example of
[1:19:40] cross-dressing and everybody everybody
[1:19:43] always shuts up after that they never
[1:19:44] they never write me back about once I
[1:19:46] mentioned Bruce Jenner because it's a
[1:19:48] witness against them here's a man talks
[1:19:52] like a man dresses like a woman has
[1:19:56] surgeries to cut off body parts that
[1:19:58] pertain to manhood and does all these
[1:20:01] paints our face there's all these awful
[1:20:02] things claiming to be a woman wearing
[1:20:06] women's clothes that's insanity
[1:20:09] that's perversion that's confusion God
[1:20:11] is not the author of that amen and so
[1:20:14] they can't say nothing against it and I
[1:20:16] said well yeah you disagree with that
[1:20:17] what about in the 1920s and 1930s when
[1:20:20] women started wearing pants a little bit
[1:20:22] and there was such a up for remember
[1:20:23] Audrey Hepburn remember that I see those
[1:20:26] those things people forget about that
[1:20:29] okay here's a good question about
[1:20:32] separation of garments this person asked
[1:20:35] me if you teach two for women not to
[1:20:39] wear pants do you also teach that we
[1:20:41] should not wear the same t-shirts as men
[1:20:43] socks as men undergarments and all these
[1:20:47] other like everything and I say well I
[1:20:50] don't have a scripture for that I said
[1:20:52] but my wife and I do that I don't wear
[1:20:54] my wife's socks
[1:20:55] she doesn't wear my socks right she
[1:20:59] doesn't wear my t-shirts I don't where
[1:21:01] he or her t-shirts I look pretty bad in
[1:21:03] her t-shirts and I would never wear them
[1:21:06] because they probably don't fit me so in
[1:21:09] in application we we're told that we
[1:21:13] never wear any garments that are the
[1:21:14] same except maybe you know you throw on
[1:21:17] the same jacket to run out to the garage
[1:21:19] for a few seconds you
[1:21:21] but I've told people to even if a woman
[1:21:23] wears her husband's t-shirt out you know
[1:21:25] or something like that is that gonna
[1:21:27] cause anybody to stumble as long as she
[1:21:29] has her long hair on it has a long skirt
[1:21:31] on they can still tell she's a woman so
[1:21:34] I I said I don't never actually know how
[1:21:36] to answer that but in practice that's
[1:21:38] what I do
[1:21:39] I have a set we have totally separate
[1:21:41] garments I don't even wear my wife's
[1:21:45] shoes because they don't fit I mean it's
[1:21:46] just kind of common sense like that but
[1:21:48] see people have some good question
[1:21:50] that's it that was it that was probably
[1:21:51] one of the most challenging questions
[1:21:52] I've had so I thought I'd share that
[1:21:57] with you it's interesting what people
[1:21:58] think of you no but I understand that
[1:22:00] like how far do you take some of these
[1:22:01] things that's a that's a that's an
[1:22:03] honest question that's a good question
[1:22:06] and that's how that's how I would say
[1:22:09] that's what I told her that's how I
[1:22:10] would do it I would just have a total
[1:22:11] separation I don't wear my wife's
[1:22:13] clothes she don't wear my clothes then
[1:22:15] we have no then we have no convictions
[1:22:18] like we're sinning right then whatever
[1:22:20] we do hadn't done it whatever you do
[1:22:21] whenever we do parmi is done in faith
[1:22:24] because if you doubt then it's into you
[1:22:26] the Bible says okay then this woman asks
[1:22:29] why can't pants on a woman be modest
[1:22:32] what about women that work out and I
[1:22:34] said well pants can technically be
[1:22:36] modest on a woman they can be loose but
[1:22:38] it's still cross-dressing
[1:22:39] it's still an abomination because it
[1:22:42] still looks like the garments breeches
[1:22:44] that pertain to men just like a man a
[1:22:48] man can wear a modest dress Bruce Jenner
[1:22:50] could wear a modest dress and be modest
[1:22:53] and not show off his male body parts but
[1:22:56] it's still cross-dressing you see that I
[1:22:59] mean I don't understand what they're
[1:23:00] saying but they're still breaking one of
[1:23:03] the laws of God one of the four
[1:23:04] guidelines that God placed and then I
[1:23:09] said I know and then I said as far as
[1:23:11] working on skirts I said I know numerous
[1:23:12] women who work out in full length skirts
[1:23:14] my wife works out at home in full length
[1:23:16] skirts she just she works out there in
[1:23:18] front of the children there in the
[1:23:19] living room and she always makes sure
[1:23:21] she's covered and she only does exercise
[1:23:23] that don't expose anything because
[1:23:26] that's what a Christian does a Christian
[1:23:28] doesn't expose themselves at any time
[1:23:31] Christian's don't compromise on the Word
[1:23:33] of God
[1:23:34] and I said if any exercise makes you
[1:23:38] endanger like you're gonna trip and fall
[1:23:40] don't do that exercise do a different
[1:23:43] exercise the God of heaven can't come up
[1:23:46] with a different exercise so you won't
[1:23:48] have to transgress his word I mean the
[1:23:51] thing is they haven't asked God about it
[1:23:53] they've got to seek God about that so I
[1:23:56] said you gotta have wisdom to know which
[1:23:58] exercise to do gotta avoid exercise that
[1:24:02] are dangerous avoid exercise that expose
[1:24:04] yourself or what would force you to
[1:24:06] crossdress just don't do it just stay
[1:24:08] away from sin oh then the other question
[1:24:15] was about a job what if your job
[1:24:17] requires the wear pants I would say
[1:24:18] first tell them that they can't deny you
[1:24:21] work basically because you're they're
[1:24:22] discriminating against your religion
[1:24:23] that's the first thing you can say but
[1:24:26] it's hard people are just they're all
[1:24:27] fearful about money which they've got to
[1:24:30] get victory over that if God asks you to
[1:24:34] wear skirts then he's got to provide a
[1:24:36] job for you to wear skirts in amen and
[1:24:38] he will he's Jehovah Jireh praise God
[1:24:41] what Christian would ever take a job
[1:24:43] that forces them to break the word of
[1:24:46] God
[1:24:47] how could you live with yourself the
[1:24:48] only way you could live with yourself is
[1:24:50] if you're in the permissive will of God
[1:24:52] and you're not born again but a Holy
[1:24:54] Ghost field person could not live with
[1:24:55] themselves they'd have to ask God for
[1:24:57] another job amen they would just trust
[1:24:59] in the Word of God because breaking the
[1:25:04] word of God is not in the plan of God
[1:25:05] that's in the plan of the permissive
[1:25:07] will of God that's a plan of iniquity
[1:25:09] and that is of the devil s not of God
[1:25:12] okay I had three hair length questions
[1:25:14] these are pretty good questions what
[1:25:16] about the ends of my hair they get split
[1:25:19] and frazzled and damaged is it okay to
[1:25:21] trim the loose ends and I say dear
[1:25:23] friend no there is nothing in the Bible
[1:25:26] about trimming women's hair in the
[1:25:27] entire Bible from cover to cover from
[1:25:29] Genesis to Revelation trimming it is
[1:25:33] is shaving it according to first
[1:25:35] Corinthians 11 and I said I've heard
[1:25:38] different opinions because her opinion
[1:25:39] was oh people say it's your hell's hair
[1:25:41] or your hair is healthier if you trim
[1:25:44] your hair and I said I've heard
[1:25:44] different I've talked to numerous women
[1:25:46] including my wife who say it's actually
[1:25:49] healthier if you don't but you still got
[1:25:51] to take care of it you just can't you
[1:25:53] can't like spray chemicals on it and do
[1:25:56] all these kinds of a dyeing your hair I
[1:25:58] don't know what I don't know all the
[1:26:00] terms in other word you can't add all
[1:26:02] these manmade chemicals and then X let
[1:26:05] hair it make your hair grow long and
[1:26:07] then expect it to get healthier you've
[1:26:09] got to treat it in a healthy manner you
[1:26:11] can't add things to it you got to wash
[1:26:13] it you got to brush it all the time you
[1:26:14] got to take care of it my girls all know
[1:26:17] all about it there's a lot of work it's
[1:26:19] a lot of work to take care of the hair
[1:26:21] but it's also a lot of work to live the
[1:26:24] Word of God right so we must we must
[1:26:27] just deal with that we must deal if
[1:26:29] that's what God wants that's what God's
[1:26:30] Word said we're happy to do it
[1:26:33] so I I just tried to say that it's
[1:26:35] actually healthier if you don't and all
[1:26:38] these chemicals and cut it's actually
[1:26:40] healthier the second one how exactly or
[1:26:47] how long do you think a man's hair is
[1:26:49] allowed to be what what would you say
[1:26:51] would be the maximum length so for this
[1:26:53] one I didn't really have any scripture
[1:26:55] to say other than so I used history I
[1:26:59] didn't have any scripture other than it
[1:27:01] must be short the Bible said if a man
[1:27:04] has long hair which means uncut it's a
[1:27:07] shame unto him so I just use a
[1:27:09] historical article I think I had a Bible
[1:27:10] Almanac that said the Jews that were
[1:27:12] poor they would just take all their hair
[1:27:14] like this in a ponytail and take the
[1:27:15] knife and cut it and then they let that
[1:27:18] hang down so it'd probably hang down to
[1:27:20] like here most Jews now that's what I
[1:27:22] read in the Almanac so that's what the
[1:27:24] men would do not the women the men the
[1:27:26] women didn't cut their hair right so
[1:27:29] that's what we find
[1:27:30] I have no scripture about how long it
[1:27:34] would be but now brother Branham said
[1:27:36] you know the angel Lord had hair down to
[1:27:37] the shoulder so that's what I tell
[1:27:39] people that asked me I said well if you
[1:27:41] technically grow your hair to your
[1:27:42] shoulder you're an angel company then
[1:27:44] but to me though
[1:27:47] would cause a little bit of confusion
[1:27:48] and I pictures I can show you what my
[1:27:50] hair looked like when it was down here
[1:27:52] Ike it looks very feminine I don't like
[1:27:54] how it looks
[1:27:55] it doesn't look very manly so to me men
[1:28:01] should be the leaders in humility and
[1:28:02] modesty and and so forth so men should
[1:28:06] have their hair as short as they short
[1:28:08] as they can so it looks like a man if
[1:28:09] they expect women to grow theirs as long
[1:28:11] as they can men should have it rather
[1:28:13] short like I told you I'd rather prefer
[1:28:15] my hair just shave it but my wife likes
[1:28:17] it a little hunger so Amen okay
[1:28:21] the third question it says um didn't
[1:28:23] Jesus have shoulder length hair so
[1:28:25] they're kind of like mocking me a little
[1:28:27] bit and I said no no one knows exactly
[1:28:30] the length of Jesus hair no one knows
[1:28:32] but we know it was an uncut because
[1:28:35] Jesus is the one who told Paul to write
[1:28:37] that women should have uncut hair
[1:28:39] because deep Paul said he learned the
[1:28:40] gospel from Jesus right in Galatians
[1:28:43] chapter one he learned it from Jesus
[1:28:45] Christ himself so Jesus would not have
[1:28:47] long uncut hair like a woman if he tells
[1:28:49] Paul that Christian woman should only
[1:28:51] have long hair and so he says well what
[1:28:54] about all these pictures of Jesus while
[1:28:57] these movies and pictures have Jesus
[1:28:58] with hair down to his down his back and
[1:29:01] I said well it could be two reasons
[1:29:03] first it might be Satan influencing the
[1:29:06] artists and movie producers to deceive
[1:29:08] people as Pro traying Christ as a woman
[1:29:11] with like a woman with long hair it
[1:29:14] might be Satan and but I said second it
[1:29:17] actually could be that Jesus had length
[1:29:19] shoulder length hair but that would have
[1:29:23] been way shorter than the women of that
[1:29:25] day because they all had long uncut hair
[1:29:27] they all did because the first time I
[1:29:30] can find anyone cutting their hair is
[1:29:31] the roaring 20s the first time now the
[1:29:34] Egyptians might have I think there's
[1:29:35] hieroglyphs that picture there was their
[1:29:37] hieroglyphs of Egyptians that you guys
[1:29:39] show me one time or not okay I thought
[1:29:42] you didn't either clothes how they
[1:29:44] dressed almost naked remember that you
[1:29:45] show me the hieroglyphs er okay yeah
[1:29:50] they were really of course they were
[1:29:51] sinners learn not the way of the heathen
[1:29:53] but I thought there are pictures of
[1:29:54] women with short hair there okay
[1:29:59] yeah the hieroglyphs remember their
[1:30:00] hairs cut cross so yeah God's people
[1:30:05] never cut their hair to the roaring 20s
[1:30:06] but then they weren't God's people
[1:30:08] anymore so they're no longer God's
[1:30:09] people they forfeited they broke the
[1:30:11] Word of God and for salvation that's
[1:30:14] between them and God I don't know God
[1:30:16] God is rich in mercy but we know it's a
[1:30:19] sin it's a shame for a woman to cut her
[1:30:21] hair dishonours her husband okay oh and
[1:30:26] here's one that kind of I felt bad about
[1:30:28] an Africa african-american woman wrote
[1:30:31] and said you're being racist because
[1:30:36] black women can't grow their hair long
[1:30:37] and she said is God unfair because I
[1:30:43] don't have long hair in other words
[1:30:44] she's saying why can the other women of
[1:30:46] other races have long hair and I can't
[1:30:48] and I said oh please forgive me I'm
[1:30:50] sorry I said I'm not racist I said what
[1:30:53] I forgot I forgot to put in the video of
[1:30:55] that women of different races have
[1:30:57] different hair links and I said God is
[1:31:00] not interested in 12-inches 2430
[1:31:03] God's not interest in the number of
[1:31:04] inches he's interested in obedience to
[1:31:07] his word with uncut hair so I said I'm
[1:31:10] sorry I said I'll put that in the book
[1:31:12] because once you get a video on YouTube
[1:31:14] you can't change it you can't edit it I
[1:31:15] mean just a little thing about YouTube I
[1:31:17] don't like that about YouTube but I
[1:31:19] understand it cuz the video has to
[1:31:20] process once it's edited has to process
[1:31:23] and save as a new file so I can't change
[1:31:25] it what I could do though is make
[1:31:27] another video I could make a part 3 on
[1:31:29] long hair in the Bible ok so that's a
[1:31:33] great question no that was a great
[1:31:34] question and I felt bad about that you
[1:31:36] know I didn't I didn't add that to the
[1:31:39] video because the title my videos long
[1:31:40] hair and the Bible and so a black woman
[1:31:43] who can't would grow hair long she might
[1:31:45] that might hurt her feelings I felt mad
[1:31:47] about that
[1:31:47] there's my hour so let me finish with
[1:31:52] this give me 10 minutes let me finish
[1:31:55] with this yeah ok this is the end of the
[1:31:59] chapter that worked out perfectly I
[1:32:00] thought I might have to go and further
[1:32:02] into chapter 8 because chapter 8 is
[1:32:03] called the perfect will of God and I
[1:32:05] want to prove at the end that we can
[1:32:07] prove that the way we dress is not just
[1:32:10] an option it's the perfect will of God
[1:32:12] there is no other way to dress and is
[1:32:15] that beautiful we can prove that no one
[1:32:17] else can prove that if they wear shorts
[1:32:20] they cut their hair they get tattoos you
[1:32:23] know earrings that have holes in it you
[1:32:25] know makeup they could they are not they
[1:32:28] can't prove by the Bible that they're in
[1:32:29] the perfect will of God
[1:32:30] were the only ones that can do you glory
[1:32:34] and then I spend that time showing out
[1:32:37] we're in the purple of God and I list
[1:32:39] each one skinny jeans not the will of
[1:32:41] God Sun us Sun dresses not the will of
[1:32:45] God and I show how you know shorts
[1:32:46] miniskirts not the will of God so I just
[1:32:49] want them to see that you can prove that
[1:32:52] the way you're dressing is either the
[1:32:54] perfect will of God or the permissive
[1:32:55] will of God and then I'm going to do it
[1:32:58] I haven't finished this part but i'ma
[1:32:59] show I'm introduced where I get all my
[1:33:00] ideas from brother branham's ministry
[1:33:03] I'm an interest brother branham's
[1:33:03] ministry and I'm gonna close with
[1:33:05] revelation 3 where it says I counsel II
[1:33:08] to have clothes white raiment because I
[1:33:12] believe Jesus to the latest in church
[1:33:13] age he's saying it I believe both for
[1:33:15] spiritually and naturally I believe
[1:33:17] Jesus is telling the churches you need
[1:33:19] to get physical clothes on and you need
[1:33:21] to get eternal life on I believe that
[1:33:24] with all my heart he said get your naked
[1:33:27] your blood and you don't even know it so
[1:33:28] I want to end the book with that I want
[1:33:30] to just drive that home people are naked
[1:33:31] today spiritually and naturally and they
[1:33:34] don't even know it amen
[1:33:36] hallelujah alright last now for the to
[1:33:41] end the chapter I show the one question
[1:33:44] that has come up in every video series
[1:33:46] it's come up in the long hair it's come
[1:33:48] up in the makeup it's coming in the long
[1:33:49] dresses of the Bible come up with the
[1:33:52] other one - I can't more anything in the
[1:33:53] last one I'm sorry
[1:33:58] let's go on your Bibles to 1st Samuel
[1:34:00] 16:7
[1:34:02] I'll look up real quick I can look it up
[1:34:04] online
[1:34:05] oh yeah modest clothing in the Bible
[1:34:09] yeah there you go there's the for long
[1:34:11] hair long dresses makeup and modest
[1:34:13] clothing there's those are the four main
[1:34:15] ones and those are my top four videos
[1:34:17] which is interesting of all the videos
[1:34:19] in the 50 videos those four are the ones
[1:34:22] that are have the most views by far - in
[1:34:25] fact 20 thousand more
[1:34:26] the highest non holiness video I have is
[1:34:31] thus saith the Lord by William Branham
[1:34:33] prophecies of the future that only has
[1:34:35] nine thousand views makeups got 85 now
[1:34:39] and then it's got sixteen thousand on
[1:34:41] the other one so we're past hundred
[1:34:43] thousand for that one long dresses at
[1:34:45] thirty nine long hair as thirty 31 and
[1:34:48] then modest clothes has twenty they're
[1:34:50] about thirty thousand okay this is the
[1:34:53] question I get asked on all four videos
[1:34:56] they say I thought God only looks at my
[1:34:59] heart I thought God doesn't look at my
[1:35:01] outward appearance in that see and then
[1:35:04] that kind of slick and that see it see
[1:35:06] how Satan's working in there it's kind
[1:35:09] of like Satan he says oh if you turn
[1:35:11] this bread into a stone you know turn
[1:35:14] this bread in stone and Jesus has to
[1:35:15] come back with more word right he said
[1:35:17] Oh jump off this pinnacle because in
[1:35:18] Psalms it says if you drop off the
[1:35:21] pinnacle the angels will pick you up
[1:35:23] that you don't dash your foot against
[1:35:24] the stone so see Satan brings us
[1:35:27] scripture so Jesus got to bring more
[1:35:28] scripture you shall not tempt the LORD
[1:35:31] thy God so that's what this that's what
[1:35:34] this is so Satan tells these people oh
[1:35:36] God doesn't care about your outward
[1:35:37] appearance he's just looking at your
[1:35:39] heart okay who'd like to read that one
[1:35:42] you got maokai read a 1st samuel 16:7
[1:35:57] alright that's slick devil uses this to
[1:36:01] get people to cut their hair he uses
[1:36:04] this to get beat women to wear makeup
[1:36:08] Oh God does how do you know girl
[1:36:10] Jessica's I talked to them I've talked
[1:36:12] to him on the phone and I've talked to
[1:36:14] them on comments on YouTube people have
[1:36:15] called me from New York some of the
[1:36:17] Texas different California people have
[1:36:21] called me we've talked about these on
[1:36:22] the phone this is what Satan tells these
[1:36:25] people Oh
[1:36:27] God doesn't care about your outward
[1:36:28] appearance he's just looking at your
[1:36:29] heart as long as you have a good heart
[1:36:31] well the Bible said your heart is
[1:36:33] deceitfully wicked above all things who
[1:36:35] can know it
[1:36:35] Jeremiah says that the only way to have
[1:36:38] a clean R is that the Holy Ghost wash
[1:36:39] out your
[1:36:40] amen and then if it wash out your heart
[1:36:42] you believe the Word of God what the
[1:36:45] Word of God says about these things make
[1:36:46] up long dresses long hair and modest
[1:36:48] clothes so anyways I bring three points
[1:36:51] I bring three reasons why this is the
[1:36:52] wrong interpretation the first one
[1:36:56] they're taking this scripture out of
[1:36:57] context in other words this scripture is
[1:37:00] not about weight or wearing makeup
[1:37:02] it's not about long hair it's not about
[1:37:05] clothing and it's not about long dresses
[1:37:09] and separation of men and women's
[1:37:11] garments it's about God choosing a king
[1:37:13] to replace all that's what it's about
[1:37:16] it's not about any of those other
[1:37:18] subjects so they're taking this
[1:37:20] scripture and applying it to a situation
[1:37:22] that it doesn't apply to and the church
[1:37:25] said amen samuel was in Bethlehem at the
[1:37:29] house of Jesse to anoint the next king
[1:37:32] of Israel to replace the rebellious saw
[1:37:37] Samuel looks at Elia ma look at this
[1:37:40] he's the firstborn he's a monster surely
[1:37:43] this is God's next preacher surely this
[1:37:47] is the next King and God has to correct
[1:37:49] Samuel and said don't look on his height
[1:37:51] or his countenance he said God it's not
[1:37:56] looking on his outward appearance God is
[1:37:59] looking at his heart and what if the
[1:38:01] Bible say later about David David was a
[1:38:03] man after the heart of God so God is
[1:38:07] going to choose someone to lead you and
[1:38:09] I who has a heart who wants to know the
[1:38:12] heart of God that's how God chooses
[1:38:15] leaders there they're the heart their
[1:38:17] greatest desire in their heart is to
[1:38:19] know the Heart of Jesus amen in other
[1:38:21] words to know the will of God so this is
[1:38:24] totally out of context doesn't even
[1:38:26] apply to Jezebel doesn't find it it's
[1:38:29] not even close to applying to Moses and
[1:38:32] abominations it's applying to the
[1:38:35] physical king God's not interested in
[1:38:38] the physical height of King David he's
[1:38:39] interested in a heart that will not
[1:38:41] rebel against the Word of God secondly
[1:38:48] this
[1:38:49] cannot negate all the other commands for
[1:38:53] modest clothing like first Timothy 2:9 I
[1:38:57] would that women dress in modest apparel
[1:39:00] remember Paul lived a thousand years
[1:39:04] after Samuel God told Samuel God doesn't
[1:39:07] look upon the outward appearance he
[1:39:09] looks at the heart but then a thousand
[1:39:12] years later God said tell those women to
[1:39:14] not wear sexy clothes right tell those
[1:39:17] men tell that maniac of gaturro tell
[1:39:20] them to get some clothes on that boys
[1:39:21] run around naked out here with demons
[1:39:23] right the same Holy Spirit so see that
[1:39:27] that idea there can't do away with all
[1:39:30] these other commands about how we
[1:39:32] present our bodies that's the second
[1:39:36] reason the first reason it's out of
[1:39:38] context it doesn't apply to that the
[1:39:40] second one it can't do away with all the
[1:39:41] other witnesses so it must be the wrong
[1:39:44] interpretation of 1st Samuel 16:7 yeah
[1:39:48] even Paul wrote about hair oh well I can
[1:39:51] cut my hair God looks at my heart God
[1:39:53] don't look at the outward appearance
[1:39:54] well Paul said if you cut it you're a
[1:39:56] shame woman God said Paul said if you
[1:39:59] grow up man
[1:40:00] you're a shame to God you're ashamed of
[1:40:02] Jesus Christ well it got Christ looking
[1:40:04] at my heart yes and that leads to my
[1:40:06] last one the outward appearance often
[1:40:09] reveals what's in your heart hey man
[1:40:12] that was my favorite one I like that one
[1:40:14] that was came to me this morning I mean
[1:40:16] I've said it before but I thank God he
[1:40:18] brought it back to me now not always
[1:40:21] though but most often the outward
[1:40:24] appearance reveals what is the condition
[1:40:27] of the heart and I listed three examples
[1:40:29] three easy for easy examples Cain after
[1:40:33] God says why don't you just sacrifice
[1:40:37] blood like your brother the Bible said
[1:40:39] he got angry and his countenance changed
[1:40:41] and he left the friends of God so his
[1:40:43] outward appearance toward God show what
[1:40:46] was in his heart now that's just your
[1:40:48] face think about painting your face
[1:40:50] makeup pride second Saul's count has
[1:40:54] changed when the evil spirits were on
[1:40:56] him the Bible said he had a countenance
[1:40:58] that was troubled he was always troubled
[1:41:00] and angry and upset when the evil
[1:41:02] spirits were on him is
[1:41:03] outward appearance gave away but when
[1:41:05] the holy when David played the music the
[1:41:07] Holy Ghost casts out those demons the
[1:41:09] Bible said he was refreshed and he loved
[1:41:11] David but when he wasn't when he wasn't
[1:41:14] anointed the Holy Spirit he hated David
[1:41:16] and his countenance was one of anger and
[1:41:19] murder a murdering spirit third the
[1:41:23] Bible said an evil woman uses a
[1:41:27] accountants of seductive facial
[1:41:30] expressions in order to tempt men into
[1:41:33] acts of adultery and fornication in
[1:41:34] proverbs 6 24 25 and 26 the Bible said
[1:41:39] don't he said my son don't let a horse
[1:41:41] woman take you with her eyes see the
[1:41:46] outward appearance the outward
[1:41:48] appearance shows what's in the heart of
[1:41:50] that the Bible calls her an evil horse
[1:41:52] woman evil her heart is evil and her
[1:41:56] outward appearance shows that here I go
[1:41:59] there was my timer again here I go
[1:42:01] forgive me I'm almost fourth the maniac
[1:42:07] for gaturro his outward appearance of
[1:42:09] being naked that was an obvious sign
[1:42:12] that he was demon-possessed just like
[1:42:15] are though the women the actresses today
[1:42:18] the musicians that go to their award
[1:42:19] ceremonies and they're half-naked their
[1:42:21] shows they're filled with demons okay
[1:42:24] now my last point I want to make is this
[1:42:26] in Matthew 23 Jesus said the Pharisees
[1:42:30] indeed are beautiful in their outward
[1:42:33] appearance so the here's the bounds
[1:42:36] sometimes your outward appearance can be
[1:42:39] beautiful and holy what I mean by
[1:42:41] beautiful is holy think about the
[1:42:43] Pharisee now think about Muslims many of
[1:42:45] them dressed very modestly don't think
[1:42:46] think about those women they cover their
[1:42:48] hair and which that's up to them or
[1:42:50] nothing about the Bible about that but
[1:42:52] they wear modest clothes and aren't
[1:42:54] tight and they look just as holy as we
[1:42:58] do if not more but they reject the blood
[1:43:03] of Jesus Christ is that right and
[1:43:06] because of that they're full of dead men
[1:43:08] bones and their only hope for salvation
[1:43:11] is to do good to a Christian who's saved
[1:43:14] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:43:16] fill with the Holy Spirit
[1:43:17] their only hope is they could be good to
[1:43:20] one of Jesus's brethren so that's the
[1:43:22] balance let's end our feet there
[1:43:24] that's the bounce you can have a
[1:43:25] beautiful outward appearance but God
[1:43:30] still sees the heart so what do we got
[1:43:32] to have we got to have a beautiful
[1:43:34] outward appearance and we got to have
[1:43:35] humble hearts amen
[1:43:37] we'll close with that by the grace of
[1:43:39] the Lord well I'm thankful phrase the
[1:43:46] Lord I'm happy I'm feeling good I feel
[1:43:47] like I'm almost at the end of I'm almost
[1:43:52] at the end of this journey here I'm so
[1:43:55] happy because I remember preaching in
[1:43:56] the summer like I'm gonna write a book
[1:43:57] this summer I remember Adam in BO heard
[1:43:59] it and they smiled and I didn't get to
[1:44:01] it for a while but now I almost got it
[1:44:02] and I can say I knew this leading was of
[1:44:05] the Lord because God's helping me get it
[1:44:07] done and I wanted to be able to be a
[1:44:11] blessing and help people if the videos
[1:44:14] are changing lives and are liberating
[1:44:16] people saving souls transforming them
[1:44:19] then I think a book can do the same by
[1:44:21] God's grace because it's another form or
[1:44:24] the Holy Spirit can minister to somebody
[1:44:26] as they focus as they meditate upon the
[1:44:29] word and how many know to that reading a
[1:44:31] real book is better than reading online
[1:44:32] let me know that that's proven that's
[1:44:34] been taught in our education circles
[1:44:36] there's something about a book that is
[1:44:39] more impactful it's more it's it's you
[1:44:43] learn better and the thing is there's no
[1:44:45] distractions because here I can get
[1:44:46] really easily distracted by other
[1:44:48] popping up and all this stuff and
[1:44:49] they're always trying to they always say
[1:44:52] oh this screen is so much more clear
[1:44:54] it's almost like paper to see they can
[1:44:57] never they'll never get to the clarity
[1:44:59] that paper has for our eyes they're
[1:45:01] there trying to get there but I'll never
[1:45:03] get because it's not paper it's not it's
[1:45:05] little pixels there's nothing better
[1:45:07] than our natural eyes on natural paper
[1:45:10] there so anyways praise the Lord God is
[1:45:12] good
[1:45:12] I'm so glad God aren't you glad God has
[1:45:14] liberated you aren't you glad got to set
[1:45:17] you free transform you praise God what a
[1:45:19] blessing let's just sing a few songs
