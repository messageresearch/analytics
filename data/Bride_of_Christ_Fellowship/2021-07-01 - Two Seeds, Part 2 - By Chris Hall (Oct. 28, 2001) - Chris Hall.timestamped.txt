[0:03] i want to read again from matthew the
[0:05] 13th chapter
[0:06] he said this morning we'll just be
[0:08] picking up where we left off
[0:11] and trying to further the thought that
[0:13] we have continued on matthew chapter 13
[0:18] read verse 24 to 30. another parable put
[0:22] him forth unto them saying the kingdom
[0:23] of heaven is like and unto a man with
[0:25] sow good seed in his field
[0:27] but while men slept his enemy came and
[0:29] sowed tears
[0:30] among the wheat and went his way but
[0:33] when the blade was sprung up
[0:35] and brought forth fruit then appeared
[0:37] the tares
[0:38] also so the servant of the householder
[0:42] came and said unto him sir this not thou
[0:44] sow good seed in thy field
[0:47] from whence then hatha tares and he said
[0:49] unto them an enemy hath done this
[0:52] and the servant said unto him wilt thou
[0:54] then that we go
[0:55] and gather them up but he said nay lest
[0:58] while you gather up the tares you root
[1:00] up also
[1:01] the wheat with them let both grow
[1:03] together until the time of the harvest
[1:05] and in the time
[1:06] and in the time of the harvest i will
[1:08] say to the reapers gather you together
[1:10] first the tares and bind them in bundles
[1:12] that to burn them but gather the wheat
[1:15] into my barn now i'd like to drop down
[1:16] to verse 37
[1:18] in which jesus actually now interprets
[1:21] the parable to them
[1:23] and he answered and said unto them he
[1:25] that soweth the good seed is the son of
[1:27] man
[1:28] and the field is the world and the good
[1:30] seed
[1:31] are the children of the kingdom but the
[1:34] tares
[1:34] are the children of the wicked one the
[1:37] enemy that sold them
[1:38] is the devil and the harvest is the end
[1:41] of the world and the reapers are
[1:43] the angels as therefore the tares are
[1:46] gathered and burned in the fire so
[1:48] shall it be in the end of the world the
[1:51] son of man shall send forth his angels
[1:52] and they shall gather out of the kingdom
[1:54] all things that offend
[1:55] and them which do iniquity and shall
[1:57] cast them into a furnace
[1:59] of fire there shall be weeping and
[2:02] wailing and gnashing
[2:03] of teeth let's just bow our hearts to
[2:05] him
[2:06] heavenly father we're just again
[2:08] thankful for your presence that we feel
[2:11] here this evening as we have come
[2:12] together lord just to
[2:14] sit at your table god knowing that we

[2:18] empty plate

[2:38] before me
[2:39] father that you just come and open them
[2:40] to our hearts and to our minds
[2:42] lord even as we spoke this morning
[2:44] father that we've got to look beyond
[2:46] just those things that we've been taught
[2:48] the lord we've got to look into the
[2:50] pages of your bible and find out what
[2:51] your word says
[2:52] and lord that's why we're here tonight
[2:54] father god is not to just
[2:56] to to to sit around and talk of our
[2:58] beliefs but lord we want to see what
[3:00] your word does say
[3:01] we just pray that you just touch every
[3:03] heart every life that's here minister to
[3:05] every need god whether it's a physical
[3:07] need
[3:07] or a spiritual need you know the hearts
[3:09] of your people you know the conditions
[3:11] of their life
[3:11] we just ask that you would minister to
[3:13] them anoint me tonight your servant
[3:15] fathers just stand here at my postal
[3:17] duty i pray that you would just
[3:19] speak to me tonight in the name of jesus
[3:21] christ we pray
[3:22] amen you may be seated i'd like to say
[3:25] that it's good to see with isaiah brooks
[3:26] and the saints from
[3:27] amen to church there in lime and
[3:30] fellowship with us tonight and just
[3:32] trust the lord with us speak to your
[3:33] hearts as we continue with this with the
[3:35] word
[3:36] i want to you know just give me a few
[3:39] moments maybe i'll just kind of
[3:41] just do a brief recap of what we kind of
[3:45] touched on this
[3:46] morning and just tried to build back up
[3:47] into where we left off at
[3:50] and i want to just just to say again
[3:53] as i said this morning that we're living
[3:56] in an
[3:56] age in which there are so many beliefs
[3:59] and so many people have so many ideas
[4:01] concerning the word of god
[4:03] and we find that as i said that you know
[4:06] you take
[4:06] all out of them just maybe in this town
[4:10] alone of how many churches there may be
[4:12] and you'll find that as you sit down
[4:14] with each organization
[4:16] each church every one of them has a
[4:18] system of beliefs by which that they
[4:20] view the word of god by
[4:22] and to understand the word of god we
[4:25] cannot take the word and
[4:26] filter it through um through belief
[4:29] filters
[4:29] but we have actually got to look at the
[4:31] word of god in light of what god said
[4:33] within it
[4:34] and i showed this morning how that that
[4:36] that as i
[4:37] told you that my parents had taught me
[4:39] wrong from a child
[4:41] and just in the simplicity of the very
[4:42] fact of the wise man being at the manger
[4:44] scene
[4:45] we took the word of god we showed that
[4:47] according to the scripture the wise men
[4:49] never was at the manger scene
[4:51] but when the wise men come to find
[4:52] christ he was two years old and they
[4:54] found him in a house and the bible
[4:56] didn't refer to him as a babe but
[4:57] referred to him as a young child
[5:00] and so in just looking in light of that
[5:02] if
[5:03] if in such an area that is so minor is
[5:06] that
[5:07] that we can be misled to believe
[5:09] something and this is something that i
[5:10] held and i fostered as
[5:12] truth and i believed it as truth and i
[5:15] and when i would
[5:16] go you know to the court and see in the
[5:18] courthouse and the different place in
[5:19] time when christmas would come
[5:21] and here was the manger scene and the
[5:23] wise men and the shepherds was there
[5:25] and here i always identified that as
[5:28] truth but later in life god
[5:30] when i looked into the word of god i
[5:31] realized that it was error
[5:34] and so the thing that i had to do was
[5:36] cast my formal belief aside to be able
[5:39] to accept the truth of the word
[5:41] and so to fully understand the word of
[5:44] god we cannot try
[5:46] and even tonight when we go into the
[5:48] father part of what we was ministering
[5:49] upon this morning
[5:51] i'll probably dare say that the majority
[5:53] of what i'll be saying
[5:54] may cut across a lot of what you've been
[5:56] taught from childhood
[5:58] but don't just sit and try to figure
[6:00] something out or
[6:01] cast something aside just because it is
[6:04] contrary to what your mother and your
[6:05] father
[6:06] always taught you are from what the
[6:08] maybe the great
[6:09] religious teachers of the day is even
[6:10] taught as well because we know that not
[6:12] all of them is wrong and i could show
[6:14] them many different points where
[6:15] where different organizations is wrong
[6:17] as we showed this morning
[6:19] that you take a child that's been born
[6:21] in the catholic home the bible in
[6:23] christianity means one thing to him
[6:25] a child that's born in a baptist home
[6:27] the bible in christianity means another
[6:28] thing to him
[6:29] a child that's born in a pentecostal
[6:31] home the bible in christianity means
[6:33] another thing to him
[6:34] but by what standard is god going to
[6:36] judge us
[6:37] to to those if we went down to the first
[6:40] baptist church tonight they're going to
[6:41] tell you
[6:42] that god is going to judge you by what
[6:44] they teach
[6:45] you go to the to the united pentecostal
[6:47] church they're going to tell you that
[6:49] god is going to judge you by what they
[6:51] preach
[6:51] but the fact of it is when when there's
[6:53] so many beliefs and so many different
[6:55] facets of religion
[6:57] where where do we stand at and by what
[6:59] standard is god going to judge us
[7:02] we know the bible said that heaven and
[7:03] earth will pass away but he said my word
[7:06] will never pass away so when it comes
[7:09] down to the finality of it there's only
[7:11] one thing that god is going to judge his
[7:13] people by
[7:14] and that is by the eternal word of god
[7:17] he's not going to judge us by
[7:19] experiences he's not going to judge us
[7:20] by sensations
[7:22] he's not going to judge us because we
[7:24] shouted he's not going to judge us
[7:25] because we danced in the spirit
[7:27] but god is going to judge us by his word
[7:30] amen so i want to just kind of just
[7:33] emphasize on those areas again as we
[7:35] we point in tonight now we have shown in
[7:38] the scriptures
[7:40] that from genesis to revelation and this
[7:42] is the thing i emphasized on this
[7:44] morning which is important to understand
[7:46] the part we want to deal with tonight
[7:48] that from genesis to revelation there
[7:50] are two seeds
[7:52] and all through the bible god identified
[7:55] the two seed we showed how that he spoke
[7:57] of those cursed
[7:58] children that was on his left hand we
[8:01] see that there was a right hand and
[8:02] there was a left hand of god
[8:04] we just read in matthew 13 where jesus
[8:06] speaking identifies the two seeds as the
[8:09] tare and the wheat
[8:10] which was sown by two different souls in
[8:13] first john 3 and 10 he speaks of the
[8:15] children of god
[8:16] and the children of the devil we show
[8:19] that there is a cursed seed and there is
[8:21] a non-cursed seed
[8:22] we've shown this morning that in genesis
[8:24] how that adam wasn't cursed
[8:26] eve wasn't cursed but the serpent was
[8:28] cursed
[8:29] and the cain was cursed then in john 17
[8:32] and 9 jesus praying he said father he
[8:35] said i pray for them but i pray
[8:37] not for the world and so over and over
[8:41] and over again
[8:42] all through the scripture jesus
[8:45] explicitly shows a separation
[8:48] between two separate seed lines there
[8:50] was
[8:51] the elect of god and the non-elect of
[8:53] god may acts 13 verse 48
[8:55] identifies those that was ordained unto
[8:58] eternal life
[8:59] jude the fourth verse or speaks of those
[9:01] that would be for old ordained unto
[9:03] condemnation
[9:04] so we find that there are those ordained
[9:06] to life those that are ordained to death
[9:09] one is born of god and the other one is
[9:11] born
[9:12] of satan now i and
[9:15] this morning we left off with matthew
[9:17] the seventh chapter and i'd like to go
[9:19] back to matthew 7 again and we're just
[9:22] going to pick up from here and just move
[9:24] right on into the thought this evening
[9:27] now in matthew 7 and there's a few other
[9:29] things that i want to point out here
[9:30] before i
[9:32] we proceed in in looking into another
[9:35] area within the word
[9:37] but again as i say we're going to be
[9:38] going through a lot of scriptures i hope
[9:40] you have your bibles to turn and read
[9:41] along with me so that you'll realize
[9:43] that i'm not just
[9:44] saying these things of my own accord but
[9:45] it's from the word of god
[9:47] now in matthew the seventh chapter
[9:50] beginning with the 17th verse notice
[9:52] now the what jesus begins to speak of
[9:55] and you're going to see as i said that
[9:57] he
[9:57] constantly identifies and separates
[10:00] two seed lines and even here in matthew
[10:04] 7 he speaks of
[10:05] in verse 17. notice how he starts out
[10:09] even so every good tree bringeth forth
[10:12] good fruit but a corrupt tree
[10:16] bringeth forth evil fruit now notice
[10:18] what he does immediately and starting
[10:20] off
[10:21] he now identifies a a good tree
[10:24] and a corrupt tree and he says now a
[10:27] good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit
[10:30] and neither can a corrupt tree bring
[10:32] forth good fruit
[10:34] and every tree that bringeth not forth
[10:36] good fruit is hewn down and cast into
[10:38] the fire
[10:39] wherefore by their fruit you shall know
[10:42] them
[10:42] not every one that say it unto me lord
[10:45] lord shall
[10:46] enter into the kingdom of heaven but he
[10:48] that doeth the will of my father which
[10:50] is in heaven
[10:51] many will say to me in that day lord
[10:53] lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[10:56] and in thy name cast out devils and in
[10:58] thy name done many wonderful works
[11:01] and then i will profess unto them i
[11:04] never
[11:04] knew you depart from me ye that work
[11:08] iniquity
[11:09] now this morning we were showing how
[11:11] that we are
[11:12] we are chosen in god before the
[11:14] foundation
[11:15] of the world and i was showing that i
[11:17] asked the question to you
[11:19] when did god recognize us as his
[11:21] children
[11:22] was it the day that we come to the altar
[11:24] and we confess our sins
[11:26] no that is not when god recognizes you
[11:28] as his children
[11:29] because we showed that in hebrews the
[11:31] seventh chapter and verse nine
[11:32] where it said as many as i may also say
[11:35] levi also
[11:36] who received tithes paid tithes in
[11:38] abraham
[11:40] god recognized levi abraham was levi's
[11:43] great great grandfather
[11:45] and god recognized lee by generations
[11:49] before levi ever came upon the earth
[11:52] and so we find that when did god
[11:53] recognize us as
[11:55] seed we know that the scripture said in
[11:57] ephesians 24 as i said this morning
[11:59] according as he has chosen us in him
[12:02] before the foundation of the world
[12:05] so we realize that we were chosen in god
[12:07] before the foundation of the world
[12:09] and her name was not put on the book the
[12:11] day that we come to the altar
[12:13] but if we were elected of god and if we
[12:16] are the children of god our names was
[12:18] all the book before the foundation of
[12:19] the world
[12:20] because he said in revelation the 13th
[12:22] chapter verse 8 and whose names were
[12:24] written on the lamb's book of life
[12:26] before the foundation of the world
[12:28] then in second timothy 2 19 he said the
[12:30] lord knoweth them that are
[12:32] kids now we come to matthew 7 and we run
[12:36] into something very
[12:38] interesting because jesus now began to
[12:41] speak
[12:41] to a people that he declared in verse 23
[12:45] he said
[12:45] i never knew you now here was a people
[12:49] remember now that
[12:51] ii timothy 2 19 the lord knoweth them
[12:54] that are
[12:55] kissed now remember a father
[12:58] knows who his children are and here was
[13:01] a people that prophesied in his name
[13:04] they spoke in tongues they killed the
[13:05] sick they raised the dead
[13:07] they've done many signs wonders notice
[13:09] now and
[13:10] everything they'd done they've done it
[13:13] in the name of jesus christ
[13:15] because they said lord have we not
[13:17] prophesied in
[13:18] thy name and in thine name of cast out
[13:21] devils and in thy name done many
[13:24] wonderful works here was a people
[13:27] that within their minds they believed
[13:30] they was totally right
[13:34] right because here they are standing
[13:36] lord we're christians we've done all of
[13:38] these
[13:39] marvelous things and notice now jesus
[13:42] begins to identify but notice what he
[13:45] said in the 20th verse
[13:47] he said wherefore by their fruit
[13:50] you shall know them now he said so you
[13:54] will know
[13:54] the kind of seed it is by the fruit
[13:58] it produces now i want to ask you a
[14:01] question and there's something i want to
[14:02] lay
[14:03] in here just before i proceed what is
[14:06] the fruit
[14:07] of the believer
[14:12] what's the fruit of believers so oh
[14:13] bless god if we speak in tongues that's
[14:16] the fruit of believer no it's not
[14:19] if we prophesy if we call them out and
[14:21] tell them what's wrong with them that's
[14:23] the fruit of believers no it's not
[14:26] if we heal the sick that's the fruit of
[14:27] believers no it's not
[14:29] because here was a people that as far as
[14:32] having experiences with god
[14:35] they could say i've had experience i've
[14:38] prophesied
[14:39] i've spoken tongues i've healed the sick
[14:41] we've done many wonderful things
[14:44] in thy name but yet jesus said depart
[14:48] from me
[14:48] i never knew you
[14:52] so the fruit he was looking for
[14:55] was not whether they could speak in
[14:57] tongues the fruit he was looking for was
[15:00] not whether they could dance the fruit
[15:02] he was looking for
[15:03] was not whether they could prophesy that
[15:05] was not what
[15:06] christ was looking for but notice if you
[15:09] have your bibles what he said
[15:10] in second thessalonians the second
[15:12] chapter and the 13th verse
[15:16] because here it raises something that
[15:18] begins to bring a lot of things
[15:20] into more perspective ii thessalonians 2
[15:23] 13
[15:24] but we are bound to give thanks always
[15:27] to god for you brethren be loved of the
[15:29] lord notice this laughs
[15:31] part now because god hath from the
[15:34] beginning chosen you
[15:35] to salvation now notice how god
[15:39] chose us to come to salvation
[15:43] through sanctification of the spirit
[15:47] and belief of the
[15:51] truth so how do we come to god how do we
[15:55] how do we how do we know that we are the
[15:58] elected of god
[15:59] how do we know that we are the seed of
[16:01] god if you come to god
[16:04] the way the bible says you'll come to
[16:06] god which is through the
[16:08] which is through the sanctification of
[16:09] the spirit and
[16:11] belief of the truth so the fruit
[16:14] of the believer or the evidence that
[16:17] they are the right
[16:19] seed is that they will believe the truth
[16:22] and what did jesus say the truth was he
[16:25] said in the bible
[16:27] thy word is truth so we are we come to
[16:31] christ the
[16:32] belief of the word not a belief in our
[16:35] beliefs
[16:39] you don't come to god through a belief
[16:41] in in your beliefs
[16:42] but we come to god through a belief in
[16:45] the word
[16:45] so it's not if let me just say it to you
[16:48] like this the same thing that paul said
[16:50] paul said that there is some that has
[16:52] risen up among you that has begun to
[16:54] pervert the gospel of christ
[16:56] and he said if any man come preaching
[16:58] any other gospel then what i have
[17:00] preached let
[17:01] him be a curse notice now
[17:04] here paul was identifying a people that
[17:07] was preaching
[17:08] they was not just totally doing away
[17:10] with the word
[17:11] but they were still preaching preaching
[17:13] christ but they actually began to bring
[17:16] judaism back into the law of grace
[17:19] and here paul began to identify that
[17:22] because they had
[17:23] aired from the word of god that they was
[17:25] removed from christ
[17:27] and they were a curse
[17:32] so it is not just taking a part of the
[17:34] word and i want to just inject this sin
[17:36] people say well bless god if we don't
[17:38] understand it now
[17:40] we'll understand it on the other side
[17:44] i hate to bust your bubble but if you
[17:47] don't understand this book now you're
[17:49] not getting to the other side
[17:52] because why would he say in this bible
[17:54] in daniel
[17:55] that he revealeth the deep and
[17:58] secret things if jesus
[18:01] if god reveals the deep and secret
[18:04] things
[18:04] then there must be a people that he is
[18:07] revealing the deep and secret things too
[18:10] remember what he told the scribes and
[18:12] pharisees he
[18:14] told them the disciples asked him said
[18:16] lord why do you speak unto them in
[18:18] parables modest
[18:19] jesus was just speaking to them he was
[18:22] telling the same story
[18:24] when he would sit down and speak a
[18:25] parable he was telling the same story
[18:28] but there was two classes of people that
[18:30] were sitting there hearing
[18:31] the scribes and pharisees the religious
[18:33] leaders of that day
[18:35] all that they was hearing was some nice
[18:37] little story
[18:38] but he said to those disciples blessed
[18:41] are your eyes for they see
[18:43] and blessed are your ears for they hear
[18:46] in other words you're going to see
[18:48] things and you're going to hear
[18:50] things that nobody else is going to see
[18:53] and hear
[18:58] so the fruit of it of the believer or
[19:00] the evidence that they are
[19:01] the right kind of seed and i want to
[19:03] just say this and i'm not saying this
[19:04] very lightly
[19:05] i'm hoping you're not basing your your
[19:07] relationship to god on some sensation
[19:11] because i can take you to people in the
[19:13] catholic church that has
[19:15] testified and it is on account with many
[19:18] witnesses that has had a many
[19:19] experience but the very thing that they
[19:21] believe is 100
[19:22] contrary to the word of god now do we
[19:26] believe the word of god or do we not
[19:27] believe the word of god
[19:29] it's not just taking a part of the word
[19:31] and single down say oh i believe that
[19:33] but i'm not going to believe that
[19:34] because that is a little bit different
[19:36] than the things that i've always been
[19:37] taught
[19:39] so the evidence wasn't signs wonders and
[19:42] miracles because
[19:43] had it been these would have been
[19:45] believers
[19:47] they had that they had prophesied they
[19:49] killed the sick they spoke in tongues
[19:51] but they didn't have the belief of the
[19:54] truth
[19:55] they had a belief in the word but it
[19:58] wasn't the right
[20:00] belief
[20:03] there's a big difference in having a
[20:06] belief in the word and having the right
[20:07] belief of the word now i want to just
[20:10] show you one more thing before i move on
[20:12] mark the 16th chapter
[20:17] because this is pretty interesting to me
[20:18] when you look at matthew
[20:20] 7 in connection to what jesus said in
[20:22] mark 16.
[20:24] notice what he says mark 16 begin with
[20:26] the 15th verse
[20:28] and he said it to them go into all the
[20:30] world and preach the gospel to every
[20:32] creature
[20:33] and he that believeth and is baptized
[20:35] shall be saved but he that believeth not
[20:36] shall be damned and these signs shall
[20:39] follow them that believe
[20:41] in my name they shall cast out devils
[20:43] they shall speak with new tongues
[20:45] they shall take up serpents and if they
[20:47] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[20:49] them
[20:49] and they shall lay hands on the sick and
[20:51] they shall recover
[20:53] now i don't know about you but if i were
[20:55] just to read the word of god
[20:57] what jesus said right here at face value
[21:00] would almost make those in matthew 7
[21:03] believers
[21:04] because notice what he said in verse 17
[21:07] and these signs shall
[21:09] follow them that believe notice the next
[21:11] thing he says now
[21:12] in my name they shall cast out
[21:16] devils they shall speak with new tongues
[21:18] they shall take up servants notice now
[21:21] mark 16 jesus is telling them that the
[21:24] signs of wonders and the miracles are
[21:26] done
[21:26] in his name well with these in matthew 7
[21:29] stood up they said lord
[21:31] we prophesied in your name we've done
[21:33] many wonderful things in your name
[21:35] but yet when jesus ends this
[21:37] conversation with those in matthew 7
[21:40] he said that he tells me he said depart
[21:42] from me you workers of iniquity i never
[21:44] knew you
[21:45] so now in mark 16 we have the
[21:48] we have jesus speaking to the believers
[21:51] but yet in matthew 7
[21:53] we find him speaking to the
[21:54] non-believers but the believer and the
[21:56] non-believer both had signed wonders and
[21:58] miracles
[22:05] now that just strikes me a little bit
[22:07] and that's a whole other message in
[22:08] itself that if i had time i would speak
[22:10] on but i don't
[22:11] but notice this now what
[22:15] was the difference between matthew 7
[22:18] and mark 16 when they both
[22:22] had signs wonders and miracles when they
[22:25] both were speaking in times
[22:26] when they both was raising the dead when
[22:29] they both was doing all of these great
[22:31] things
[22:32] what made the difference because one
[22:34] group was believers and one group was
[22:37] non-believers
[22:38] one group was a good tree the other
[22:40] group was a corrupt tree
[22:41] one group was ordained to life the other
[22:43] group was ordained of condemnation
[22:52] notice they both had signs
[22:55] and wonders and miracles they both
[22:58] had faith in god to believe god
[23:02] for signs wonders and miracles
[23:05] but they didn't both have the word
[23:12] because notice now what he tells them
[23:15] now
[23:16] the original commission and people say
[23:20] all these sons shall follow them that
[23:22] believe that is truth but the original
[23:25] commission is found in verse 15
[23:28] by which jesus said and he said unto
[23:30] them go
[23:31] into all the world and preach the gospel
[23:36] to every creature and notice what he
[23:39] says in verse 16
[23:41] where so many people misconstrue this
[23:43] scripture because they single it out
[23:45] itself
[23:45] and he said and he that believeth and is
[23:47] baptized shall be saved
[23:49] but he that believeth not shall be
[23:51] damned then they go right into the next
[23:52] church and these signs shall follow them
[23:54] that belief
[23:55] and they see see if you've got enough
[23:57] faith signs wonders and miracles
[23:59] will follow you but let me say this
[24:03] faith for a miracle will not save you
[24:11] you can take a prostitute off the street
[24:12] that can have enough faith in god and
[24:14] get healed
[24:16] i've seen people that that was of no
[24:19] account
[24:19] of whatsoever claimed no christianity at
[24:22] all but yet would have enough faith in
[24:23] god to kill him and then you take a
[24:25] believer that
[24:25] that is a bible believing christian and
[24:27] not even have enough faith for healing
[24:30] so this believing when it speaks of
[24:32] believing here it's not
[24:34] dealing with the faith believing
[24:37] it's not to have enough faith to conjure
[24:39] up enough faith but what are we to
[24:41] believe
[24:42] notice what he says he that believeth
[24:44] and is baptized what are we believing
[24:47] verse we've got to believe what he said
[24:49] in verse 15
[24:50] preach the gospel to every creature and
[24:54] to kill
[24:54] that believer to him that believeth what
[24:57] that believes the gospel that's being
[25:00] preached
[25:00] well what is the gospel the gospel is
[25:03] the anointed word for the
[25:05] hour it's the unadulterated word of god
[25:09] and jesus said he said preach the gospel
[25:12] to everyone and to him that believeth
[25:14] and this baptized shall
[25:16] be saved but notice what he says now
[25:20] because this is very important the next
[25:22] phrase to understand matthew 7
[25:25] and he that believeth not
[25:30] he that believeth not shall be
[25:33] damned now what was happening
[25:36] to the group in matthew 7 signs wonders
[25:40] and miracles but christ
[25:42] when he ends his conversation from them
[25:44] depart from me you workers of iniquity
[25:48] i never knew you what was happening
[25:51] the gospel do you know what iniquity is
[25:54] iniquity is to be presented with truth
[25:59] iniquity is to be presented with truth
[26:02] and
[26:02] fail to walk in it
[26:06] and here was a people that was being
[26:09] presented truth
[26:11] they was being presented the
[26:13] unadulterated word of god
[26:15] and they failed to work in it they
[26:17] believed not therefore jesus had to
[26:20] carry out his own word
[26:23] and damn them you know it's what it
[26:27] that's what it is because he goes right
[26:28] into the next
[26:29] verse 24 in matthew 7 he said therefore
[26:31] whosoever heareth these saiyans of mine
[26:33] and
[26:33] vieweth them in other words has
[26:35] obedience that's what doing is
[26:37] obedient he said i would liken him to a
[26:39] wise man
[26:42] so we find now that
[26:45] mark 16 is a people that heard and
[26:47] believed and walked in the obedience
[26:49] of what they heard matthew 7 is just the
[26:54] opposite a people that was presented
[26:56] with the truth of the word and rejected
[27:00] it and turned it down
[27:01] maybe because it was contrary to what
[27:04] their pastor had always preached to them
[27:07] but for what cause it was they they
[27:09] walked in iniquity
[27:10] they was presented truth and they turned
[27:13] it down and
[27:14] jesus said he said you are he said i
[27:16] don't even know
[27:17] you you never proceeded forth you never
[27:19] come for me
[27:20] i'm not your father depart from me you
[27:23] workers
[27:23] of iniquity now i want to just move on
[27:28] if i may now
[27:34] let's go back to first john the third
[27:37] chapter
[27:39] the tenth verse
[27:42] because here we s we see two c
[27:45] two c's two seeds one believing the
[27:49] truth
[27:49] another one rejecting the truth of god
[27:53] and this to this pattern runs from
[27:56] genesis
[27:57] to revelation i wanted to say this to
[27:59] you you cannot build a doctrine for one
[28:01] scripture
[28:03] but it's got to tie from genesis to
[28:04] revelation when you can see something
[28:05] from genesis to revelation you know it's
[28:07] the truth of god
[28:09] now notice now first john the 3rd
[28:11] chapter the 10th verse
[28:13] because i want to now move into an area
[28:16] of where does these two feet come from
[28:19] where is their origination where do they
[28:21] where do they spring from
[28:23] notice now first john
[28:27] let me get there i thought i was there
[28:28] but i was first john 3
[28:30] 10 invest the children of god
[28:34] are manifested and the children
[28:37] of the devil whosoever death not
[28:40] righteousness is not of god neither is
[28:43] he
[28:43] that loveth not his brother
[28:47] now here we find john speaking of the
[28:50] seeds that we have been looking at
[28:52] and john identifies these two seeds
[28:56] as children and he calls them
[28:59] the children of god and the children
[29:02] of the devil so when we just take the
[29:05] comparison just a moment
[29:07] of looking at mark 16 versus matthew 7
[29:11] we see the two sets of children
[29:14] we see the children of god and we see
[29:17] the children of the devil
[29:20] one that can accept and believe the word
[29:22] of god and one that cannot accept and
[29:25] believe the word of god
[29:26] now the word child declares that you
[29:30] have a father
[29:34] now i want you to understand this now to
[29:36] be a child
[29:37] you had to have a father and if there
[29:41] is two sets of children
[29:45] there had to be two fathers
[29:50] now just think a while to be a child you
[29:54] had to come from a sea and the child
[29:57] is the product of the life that was in
[30:00] the seed and produces
[30:02] the same life now notice what he said
[30:05] again in the 10th verse of first john 3
[30:08] in this the children of god are
[30:10] manifested and the children of the devil
[30:13] whosoever death not righteousness is not
[30:16] of god
[30:16] neither he that loveth not his
[30:21] john tells us in this latter part
[30:24] neither he
[30:25] that loveth not his brother and john
[30:28] tells us that whosoever doth
[30:30] doeth not righteousness is not of god
[30:33] and then takes us to the beginning in
[30:36] verse 11
[30:37] where he said for this is the message
[30:40] that you have heard
[30:41] from the beginning that we should love
[30:44] one another and he tells us that
[30:47] cain wasn't of god because it was he
[30:52] that didn't love his brother
[30:57] this is the message you have heard from
[30:58] the beginning notice what john's doing
[31:00] now john's taking us
[31:01] all the way back to the beginning and he
[31:04] is now he's identifying the children of
[31:06] god and the children of the devil
[31:07] and he begins to show that whosoever
[31:09] doth not righteousness is not of
[31:11] god not of god neither he that loveth
[31:14] not his brother
[31:15] this is the message you have heard from
[31:17] the beginning amen that he said
[31:19] that we should love one another
[31:22] none they'll notice now we find that
[31:24] cain
[31:25] showed his connection to the wicked one
[31:28] by his hatred and by slaughtering his
[31:31] brother because
[31:32] what verse 12 not as king
[31:36] who was of that wicked one
[31:39] and slew his brother and went for
[31:41] slewing him
[31:42] because his own works were evil and his
[31:46] brothers were righteous now notice now
[31:49] cain hated abel
[31:52] right genesis 3 15 i will put enmity
[31:57] between thy seed and her seat and the
[32:00] word enmity there
[32:01] is hatred i will put hatred between thy
[32:05] seed and his seed
[32:09] verse 12 tells us that cain was
[32:13] evil and abel
[32:16] was righteous not as king who was of
[32:19] that wicked one and slew his brother
[32:21] and wherefore showing him because his
[32:23] own works
[32:24] were evil and his brother's righteous
[32:29] you see each seed produced the life
[32:34] of their father now remember that verse
[32:37] 10 speaks of
[32:38] children with separate fathers the
[32:40] children of god
[32:43] and the children of the devil
[32:48] now watch here now let's go back a
[32:50] minute to matthew the 13th chapter
[32:52] because
[32:54] when jesus speaks a parable in the bible
[32:57] he wasn't just speaking it just to
[32:59] to make up time but he was actually
[33:02] relaying something that had a very
[33:04] significant importance to it it was a
[33:07] message it was something
[33:08] that when he told the disciples he said
[33:10] it's given unto you to know the
[33:12] mysteries of the kingdom
[33:14] and how was he teaching him the
[33:15] mysteries of the kingdom he was teaching
[33:17] them the mysteries of the kingdom
[33:18] through parables
[33:20] and when jesus would sat down and began
[33:22] to speak to them and tell a story
[33:24] he was actually trying to reveal
[33:27] something to them
[33:28] he was revealing something that is a
[33:30] mystery and a mystery is something that
[33:32] is not
[33:33] fully understood or known but can only
[33:35] be understood
[33:36] by a divine revelation
[33:41] given unto you to know the mystery just
[33:43] given unto you to know those things that
[33:45] are not fully understood but can only
[33:46] come by divine revelation that's what
[33:48] jesus was telling the disciples
[33:49] and here now he comes and he begins to
[33:51] break into them
[33:52] and begins to speak to them apparently
[33:54] begin to speak to them a mystery of the
[33:56] kingdom
[33:57] something that is not fully known or
[33:59] understood except by divine revelation
[34:01] so notice now in matthew the 13th
[34:03] chapter beginning with the 24th verse
[34:05] again i want to just emphasize on this
[34:07] here it comes with the parable now
[34:09] and another parable put it forth say
[34:10] unto them saying the kingdom of heaven
[34:12] is lacking unto a man which sowed good
[34:15] faith in his field and
[34:18] while he's well men slept his enemy came
[34:21] and sowed tears
[34:23] among the wheat and went his way but
[34:25] when the blade was sprung up and brought
[34:27] forth fruit then appeared the tares also
[34:30] so so the servants of the house only
[34:31] came and said unto him sir just not thou
[34:33] so good
[34:34] seed and thy field and from which had
[34:35] the tears and he said unto them an
[34:37] enemy has done this and he said now the
[34:41] servant said unto him what thou that we
[34:42] gather them up and
[34:43] and he said nail us while you gathered
[34:45] the tears you rode up also the wheat
[34:46] with them
[34:47] but let bro both go together until the
[34:49] time of the harvest and in the time of
[34:50] the harvest i will say to the reapers
[34:52] gather yet together first the tariffs
[34:54] and bind them in bundles of
[34:55] to burn them but gather the wheat into
[34:57] my barn now here jesus places the
[34:59] parable out
[35:00] but then he drops down in verse 37 and
[35:03] begins to identify
[35:04] what he was trying to say to them notice
[35:07] what he says now in verse 37
[35:09] but he answered and said unto them he
[35:12] that soweth the good seed is the son of
[35:14] man
[35:15] the field is the world and the good seed
[35:18] are the children of the kingdom
[35:19] but the tares are the children of the
[35:22] wicked one
[35:23] and the enemy that showed them is the
[35:26] devil
[35:27] and the harvest is the end of the world
[35:29] and the reapers are the angels
[35:31] and as therefore the tares are gathered
[35:34] and burned in the fire so
[35:36] shall it be at the end of the world
[35:39] notice this now
[35:40] in matthew 13 verses 24 to 30 and verses
[35:44] 37 to 39 we find here that there is two
[35:48] sowings of seed
[35:51] by two different sowers
[35:55] the siege was not sown by the same soil
[35:57] but the seeds were sown by two different
[35:59] sowers
[36:02] one was sown by the son of man and the
[36:05] second one was the enemy
[36:07] which was the devil now notice now
[36:10] each seed that was sown produced
[36:13] after its kind remember the law of
[36:16] genesis 1 11 and 12
[36:18] when he said let every seed bring forth
[36:21] of
[36:21] its kind remember what he said in
[36:23] matthew 7
[36:24] jesus was not just saying things ideally
[36:27] but
[36:27] everything he was saying was trying to
[36:30] shed farther light onto something
[36:33] and in matthew 7 he said wherefore he
[36:35] said a good tree cannot bring forth
[36:37] corrupt fruit
[36:39] neither can a corrupt tree bring forth
[36:41] good fruit of
[36:42] amen so what was he showing us that the
[36:45] kind of
[36:45] sower the life whatever the sower soul
[36:48] that's what the seed had to be
[36:53] the tear was a tear and the wheat was a
[36:57] wheat and they could not
[36:59] change what they was
[37:03] they produced the life of their souls
[37:06] which in this case i want to just go
[37:07] ahead and say fathers
[37:09] because in matthew 13 verse 38 he calls
[37:12] these seeds children for he said in
[37:15] verse 30 the filters of the world and
[37:17] the good seed are the children of the
[37:18] kingdom
[37:19] and he said but the tares are the
[37:21] children of the wicked ones
[37:23] so we had two swords or two fathers that
[37:26] was showing two
[37:27] separate seeds and each seed produced
[37:30] the nature of its father
[37:32] one came out of terror you know what a
[37:34] terror is a tear is an impersonator of
[37:37] the wheat
[37:38] on the outside it looks just like the
[37:41] wheat
[37:41] but when you break it open there is no
[37:44] grain
[37:44] on the inside of it and that's what you
[37:47] had in mark
[37:48] 16 you had a genuine wheat seed
[37:52] but in matthew the seventh chapter you
[37:54] had nothing more than an impersonator of
[37:56] christianity
[37:57] that on the outside looked like
[37:59] everything but the seed was wrong
[38:06] amen the word of god
[38:13] now cain and abel
[38:17] and i want you to hold on to your seats
[38:18] a while but cain and abel
[38:21] produce the life of their fathers
[38:24] cain's works were evil
[38:28] while abel's was righteous for he said
[38:31] in first john 3 12
[38:33] not as cain who was of the wicked one
[38:36] and his own works were evil but abel his
[38:40] brothers was righteous
[38:42] remember cain was cursed
[38:46] not able right
[38:50] genesis 4 11 and now art thou cast from
[38:53] the earth
[38:54] but abel was not cursed
[38:59] you might say well i thought cain and
[39:00] abel had the same fathers well that's
[39:02] where i'm going to differ with you
[39:06] because the word of god and the bible
[39:07] teaches totally differently
[39:10] amen now as i said you're going to have
[39:14] to
[39:14] go beyond your formal beliefs
[39:18] you've got to go beyond the wise men of
[39:20] the means you're saying
[39:21] you've got to go and say well lord what
[39:23] does your word say because that's what i
[39:25] want to know
[39:25] that only those that are going to make
[39:27] it is going to make it through a belief
[39:28] in the truth
[39:30] right now according to the bible
[39:35] i believe that the original sin was not
[39:37] eating an apple
[39:40] but the sin that came to the human race
[39:43] was through a
[39:44] sexual act you might say that the bible
[39:48] said that they partook of a forbidden
[39:50] fruit and that's what caused the fall
[39:52] that's exactly right if you have an
[39:54] understanding of the scripture
[39:56] and tie it from genesis to revelation
[39:59] you can't just single out one scripture
[40:01] and try to understand something
[40:03] but you've got to look at the continuity
[40:05] of the word from genesis
[40:07] all the way to revelations
[40:10] notice now turn with me in the second
[40:11] peter the first chapter of the fourth
[40:13] verse
[40:14] ii peter 1 verse 4. i want you to notice
[40:17] what the scripture says now i'm going to
[40:18] begin to lay some things in
[40:20] scripture after scripture after
[40:21] scripture and i want you to see this for
[40:23] yourself
[40:24] and second peter the first chapter the
[40:25] fourth verse notice what peter begins to
[40:28] say now
[40:29] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[40:32] great and precious promises
[40:34] that by these you might be the partakers
[40:37] of the divine
[40:38] nature notice this last phrase now
[40:41] having
[40:42] escaped the corruption
[40:45] having escaped the corruption that is in
[40:48] the world through lust
[40:53] now peter tells us that the corruption
[40:55] came
[40:56] into the world through lust and
[40:59] lust is a desire for what is forbidden
[41:03] and so corruption came into the world
[41:05] through
[41:06] the original sin
[41:11] now go to psalms 51 verse 5.
[41:14] psalms 51 5.
[41:24] notice what david says now in relation
[41:26] to what we just read
[41:27] behold i was shaping iniquity
[41:32] and in sin
[41:35] did my mother conceive me
[41:39] now i want to ask you a question how was
[41:42] david conceived in sin if his parents
[41:45] were married
[41:46] and the bible said the bed was undefiled
[41:52] because it is not a sin for me to have
[41:54] sexual relations with my wife
[41:58] because that is a part of marriage and
[42:01] david's mother and father was married
[42:04] but yet when david relays this
[42:06] he said in sin did my mother conceive me
[42:09] he it wasn't sin for him to be conceived
[42:14] but through that sinful act which
[42:16] brought
[42:17] corruption into the world
[42:20] this is how david came to recognize it
[42:23] as sin
[42:24] he was brought into the world through a
[42:26] sinful act of adultery
[42:28] in which the serpent begotted
[42:34] go to genesis the second chapter now
[42:43] genesis 2 verse 8 and 9.
[42:47] notice now here jesus says how god is
[42:50] speaking now
[42:51] and the lord god planted he planted
[42:54] a garden eastward in eden and very put
[42:58] the man
[42:58] whom he had farmed and out of the ground
[43:03] made the lord god grow every tree that
[43:05] is pleasant to the site
[43:06] good for food the tree of life also in
[43:09] the midst of the garden and the tree of
[43:11] knowledge of good and evil
[43:13] verse 16 and 17 now and the lord god
[43:16] commanded the man saying of
[43:18] every tree of the garden thou mayest
[43:21] freely
[43:22] eat but of the tree of knowledge of good
[43:25] and evil
[43:26] thou shalt not eat of it for in the day
[43:28] thou eat us thereof thou
[43:30] shalt surely die
[43:33] now verse 9 when he says
[43:37] out of the ground may the lord god to
[43:38] grow every tree that is pleasant to the
[43:39] sight
[43:40] and good for food the first part
[43:44] deals with trees growing that was good
[43:46] for food
[43:47] and then there's a semicolon which is a
[43:50] pause or a change of thought
[43:54] and he says now after the semicolon
[43:57] after the pause after the change of
[43:59] thought
[44:00] he said then in the midst of the garden
[44:02] was two more trees
[44:04] the tree of life and the tree of
[44:06] knowledge of good and evil
[44:09] now notice now in verse 9 it says that
[44:12] out of the ground
[44:13] grow every tree that was
[44:16] good for food out of the ground got
[44:19] every tree that was good for food
[44:20] but notice in verse 17 but of the tree
[44:23] of knowledge and good and evil thou
[44:24] shalt not eat
[44:25] but from the day that you deserve it
[44:26] thou shalt surely die
[44:30] now i want to just make one statement
[44:33] here
[44:33] any tree that will kill you
[44:38] isn't good for food
[44:42] right and in verse nine he said it out
[44:46] of the ground may the lord god grow
[44:47] every tree that was blessed inside good
[44:48] for food
[44:49] chemical and the tree of life also
[44:53] notice what he's doing now he is making
[44:55] a separation
[44:58] between the trees that grown out of the
[45:00] ground and the tree of knowledge of good
[45:02] and evil and
[45:03] grown out of the ground so there was
[45:07] something forbidden that would bring
[45:09] death to the human race
[45:13] something forbidden that would bring
[45:15] death to the human race let's go to
[45:17] genesis the third chapter now
[45:22] genesis 3 now the serpent was more
[45:25] subtle than
[45:26] any beast of the field which the lord
[45:28] god had made and he said unto the woman
[45:30] yeah if god said you shall not eat of
[45:31] the heat of every tree of the garden
[45:33] and the woman said unto the serpent we
[45:34] may eat of the fruit of the trees the
[45:36] trees
[45:36] plural of the garden and notice now but
[45:39] of the fruit of the tree which is in the
[45:41] midst of the garden god has said you
[45:42] shall not eat of it neither shall you
[45:44] touch it lest you die
[45:46] and the servant said you said unto the
[45:47] woman you shall not surely die
[45:49] for god does know that in the day that
[45:50] you either of your eyes shall be opened
[45:51] until you shall be as god knowing good
[45:53] and evil
[45:54] now notice you drop down into verse to
[45:56] verse 15
[45:57] and you see after from here all the way
[46:00] down to verse
[46:00] 15 you come into verse 15 and i will put
[46:02] enmity between thy between
[46:04] thee and the woman in between thy seed
[46:05] and hershey now somewhere between
[46:08] matthew between genesis 3 and 1 and
[46:10] genesis 15
[46:12] there was two seed lines showed up
[46:16] and prior to this there was only one
[46:19] adam seedlings but between genesis 3 and
[46:23] genesis
[46:24] genesis 3 1 and genesis 5 3 15 2
[46:27] seedlines shows up
[46:29] now my previous teaching
[46:32] as i said to you and i emphasize over
[46:34] and over again you cannot base your
[46:36] salvation on your previous teaching
[46:39] you've got to base it on the word of god
[46:40] and my previous teacher would have me to
[46:43] believe that this is a snake
[46:45] wrapped around a tree eating an apple
[46:47] and talking to eve you know why i
[46:49] believe that when i was a child
[46:51] because i used to have me a children's
[46:52] bible
[46:54] and in there when it come to genesis 3
[46:56] here was
[46:57] standing there with a big bright bread
[46:59] apple and the python was
[47:01] wrapped around a tree and and so this is
[47:04] the image that's projected into our mind
[47:06] and we believe something off a stupid
[47:08] cartoon
[47:12] right now notice this now
[47:17] according to the scriptures there's no
[47:19] way
[47:21] that the teaching is right because
[47:24] first of all the serpent doesn't become
[47:26] a slytherin snake
[47:28] until after the curse
[47:34] because in genesis 3 1 he's not a
[47:36] serpent
[47:37] as we would think it as a snake
[47:41] now i want to just look at the
[47:43] characteristics of this serpent because
[47:45] i want to first of all
[47:46] shatter your theology that it was a
[47:47] snake wrapped around a tree
[47:50] and if i could shatter that theology
[47:52] then maybe you'll open your mind up
[47:53] enough
[47:54] to understand what god is actually
[47:55] saying here
[47:57] the first thing as i said is that the
[47:59] serpent here isn't a reptile
[48:03] well the bible said that he was more
[48:05] subtle than any
[48:06] beast of the field never
[48:09] said he was a sceptile identified as a
[48:11] beast
[48:15] so now i've taken your snake out of the
[48:17] tree
[48:18] and put him on the ground
[48:22] he stood at the head of all
[48:25] inferior animals for wisdom and
[48:27] understanding
[48:28] because the bible said in verse 1 of
[48:31] genesis 3
[48:32] that the serpent was more stepped off
[48:35] and the word settle is cunning either
[48:37] sly
[48:38] intelligent
[48:41] whatever this was it was
[48:45] very intelligent it was very
[48:49] cunning it was very artful
[48:53] another thing about this serpent that i
[48:55] think is very
[48:56] important to point out is that he won't
[49:00] erect
[49:03] for this is implied in his punishment
[49:06] when he said
[49:07] in verse 14 and the lord god said unto
[49:09] them said because thou has done this to
[49:11] our curse
[49:11] above all caliber every beast of the
[49:13] field and upon thy belly shalt thou
[49:15] go and the dust shall eat all the days
[49:17] of thy life
[49:19] so we know that by the curse he wasn't
[49:22] slithering before this
[49:25] because after the curse the part of the
[49:27] curse was upon thy belly
[49:31] shalt thou cross
[49:35] so prior prior to the fall
[49:39] the serpent stood erect he stood upright
[49:43] like a man and he was subtle he was
[49:47] cunning he was intelligent
[49:49] and we find that he was he was also
[49:53] endued with the gift of speech
[50:01] for the scriptures identifies that he
[50:03] had a conversation with him
[50:06] he was also endued with the gift of
[50:09] reason
[50:11] for we find him reasoning and disputing
[50:16] with eve he was very quick to respond to
[50:20] even verses four and five
[50:23] as in their conversation so he was
[50:25] reasoning everything she was saying
[50:29] it is also important to point out that
[50:32] these characteristics were very common
[50:35] to the serpent it wasn't something that
[50:36] just happened to show up one day
[50:41] because it is evident that even seen him
[50:43] walking wrecked like a man
[50:45] she had seen him talk and she had seen
[50:47] and seen him reason
[50:49] and there is no implication in the
[50:51] scripture that she was surprised or even
[50:53] intrigued
[50:54] that this serpent was talking to her now
[50:57] i don't know about you the rest of you
[50:59] sisters in here but i know my wife
[51:02] if she was walking through the garden
[51:04] one day and a serpent said
[51:08] hey my wife's not going to stand around
[51:11] to talk
[51:15] so it wasn't something that caught her
[51:17] by surprise
[51:20] it wasn't something that shocked her
[51:23] it wasn't something that she was just
[51:25] walking by
[51:26] and here the serpent begins to speak and
[51:28] to oh my god this thing's talking
[51:32] but eve had seen this before for
[51:35] these were the characteristics of the
[51:38] church
[51:38] this was how god created him
[51:46] you see how the serpent never been known
[51:48] to speak before
[51:50] his addressing eve it would have surely
[51:52] excited her and even
[51:54] filled her with caution hey
[51:57] you better believe if i'm walking
[51:58] through the woods and something that's
[52:00] never spoke to me starts speaking to me
[52:02] i'm going to be very cautious
[52:06] but eve had no doubt spoken to this
[52:08] serpent on prior occasions
[52:10] and this was quite normal for her
[52:14] because i also want to point out that
[52:16] the way the scripture is written
[52:18] it implies that this is only part
[52:21] of the conversation
[52:24] that he's had with the serpent at this
[52:26] particular conversation because notice
[52:28] how
[52:28] the conversation begins yeah
[52:34] it wasn't that this was just the
[52:35] beginning of a conversation
[52:37] but when moses goes back and god permits
[52:40] because remember when moses wrote this
[52:42] these people were dead and moses was
[52:45] seeing
[52:46] by vision and he was writing what god
[52:47] was permitting to see and he was writing
[52:50] just enough of history
[52:53] to give us insight to what took place
[52:56] back there
[52:57] every instance of what took place was
[52:59] not there
[53:00] but yet he'd give us just enough and now
[53:02] we can link it with everything else
[53:03] that's in the bible
[53:04] and begin to formulate an entire picture
[53:10] now i also want to just show you that
[53:14] that this in this conversation
[53:18] it seems to be the continuation of the
[53:21] discourse in which
[53:22] the preceding part of the conversation
[53:24] isn't given
[53:26] and the proof that the serpent and the
[53:28] proof that
[53:29] the serpent in the question was endued
[53:30] with the gift of reason and the speech
[53:33] for no surprise is testified on the part
[53:36] of me
[53:37] she just simply just kind of you know
[53:40] yeah
[53:41] well you know he's talking about
[53:42] something very casual
[53:46] there's no doubt she's spoken to him
[53:48] before this account
[53:52] now the serpent was almost human because
[53:55] he had a human characteristics about him
[53:58] now i wanted to say something here
[54:00] because
[54:01] science tells us that there's a missing
[54:03] link between the animal kingdom and the
[54:05] humans
[54:06] and i'll say this to you they will never
[54:09] find the sling because the church the
[54:11] curse
[54:12] changed it from a beast to a snake
[54:16] see i have already have a jump start on
[54:17] them because i know what the word of god
[54:19] said
[54:20] they're running around looking for it we
[54:22] already know what it is
[54:26] now remember that satan was cast to the
[54:28] earth
[54:29] for trying to overthrow god's kingdom
[54:32] because in revelation 12 and 9 the bible
[54:34] said
[54:34] there was war in heaven michael and his
[54:37] angels fought against looser and his
[54:39] angels and he said he was cast out for
[54:40] there was no place
[54:42] found for him in heaven and soon as
[54:44] satan is cast out of heaven
[54:47] the first place we find satan is in the
[54:49] garden of eden
[54:51] because turn we did zeke of the 28th
[54:53] chapter the 13th first
[54:57] ezekiel 28 13.
[55:07] here's god speaking now to lucifer
[55:12] he said thus been in eden in the garden
[55:14] of god
[55:17] that's been in eden the garden of god
[55:20] every precious stone was thy covenant
[55:22] the sod is a topaz
[55:23] and the dime of the world the onyx the
[55:25] jasper the sapphire the enemy cabunacle
[55:27] and gold
[55:27] and the workers ship without tablets and
[55:29] our pipes were prepared to be in the day
[55:30] that thou
[55:31] was created now here he is speaking to
[55:35] the devil
[55:36] and the first place when he says he said
[55:38] thou art spinning and eating the garden
[55:40] of god
[55:41] now i want to ask you this question now
[55:44] when god
[55:45] cast him out of heaven down to earth
[55:47] what was satan doing in eden
[55:52] let's go to isaiah 14. maybe this will
[55:54] answer the questions
[55:57] isaiah 14.
[56:08] notice now in these passages of
[56:11] scripture
[56:12] god gives us a look into the mind and
[56:14] into the heart of satan
[56:16] these scriptures reveal satan's intent
[56:20] and his purpose god breaks into
[56:23] discernment now and speaking to this
[56:25] devil he said power thou
[56:26] fallen from heaven o lucifer
[56:29] now god's asking the question how is it
[56:31] that you're falling
[56:33] son of a morning how have thou cut down
[56:35] to the ground which did us weaken the
[56:36] nations now notice now
[56:37] now he's going to tell why he fell for
[56:40] thou
[56:41] said in thine hearts i will
[56:45] ascend into heaven i
[56:49] will exalt my throne above the stars of
[56:52] god which the stars of god are the sons
[56:54] of god because remember what god told
[56:56] abraham
[56:56] he said look to the stars of the heaven
[56:58] and he said so shall i see
[56:59] thee i will exalt my throne above the
[57:03] stars of god
[57:04] above the sons of god i will sit also
[57:07] upon the mount of the congregation in
[57:09] the side of the north
[57:11] i will ascend above the heights of the
[57:13] clouds i will be
[57:14] like the most high he said yet shalt
[57:18] thou be brought down
[57:19] to hell to the size of the pit notice
[57:23] there was a war in heaven because satan
[57:25] exalted his will above the will of god
[57:29] there shouldn't be but one will and that
[57:30] is the will of the word and if you've
[57:32] got anywhere that is contrary to this
[57:33] word you've got to get rid of that word
[57:34] because even jesus had to deny his own
[57:36] will in the garden when he said father
[57:37] not my will but thine will be done and
[57:40] here was satan that exalted his will
[57:41] above the will of god
[57:42] and now iniquity was found in his heart
[57:45] because he said in ezekiel he said that
[57:46] was perfect in the day that was created
[57:48] until iniquity was formed indeed
[57:50] but notice now god begins to give us
[57:52] insight into the very mind and the very
[57:53] heart of satan
[57:54] and notice now what was satan doing in
[57:57] eden
[57:57] verse 13 begins to give us understanding
[58:00] now
[58:02] for thou said in thine heart i will
[58:04] ascend into heaven i will exalt my
[58:06] throne above the stars of god
[58:07] i would sit upon the mount of the
[58:09] congregation in the sides of the north
[58:12] notice now satan wanted everything
[58:15] that god had satan desired
[58:18] so much to be like god but he could not
[58:21] create
[58:22] he could only pervert creation
[58:26] god had children so
[58:29] satan desired children
[58:32] god had a seed so satan
[58:36] wanted to see because notice he said i
[58:38] in verse 14
[58:39] i will be like the most high
[58:43] now i want to just inject this eve had
[58:46] the ability within her
[58:48] to produce life
[58:52] satan couldn't create on his own but eve
[58:54] had the ability of creation within her
[58:56] own world
[58:58] so satan goes to that source
[59:01] and this was as close to creating that
[59:03] satan can get
[59:05] so satan goes to the garden of eden
[59:08] and he incarnates himself
[59:12] into the serpent and went to eve so that
[59:14] he might create
[59:16] life now remember that
[59:19] satan was in eden already and had
[59:21] already been
[59:22] cursed so he already had a wicked
[59:28] life source
[59:33] now i want to just break this down to
[59:35] you now so you'll see something that
[59:37] maybe you've never seen before
[59:39] in verse 13 i want to read this
[59:40] scripture again but i want to focus on a
[59:42] phrase
[59:44] for thou said in the heart i will ascend
[59:46] into heaven i will exalt my throne above
[59:48] the stars of god
[59:49] i will sit upon the mount of the
[59:50] congregation now how are you going to do
[59:52] it
[59:52] he said i'm going to go to the side
[59:53] anymore
[59:58] now this word science
[1:00:02] in the hebrew comes from the hebrew word
[1:00:04] yaric which is y-a-r-e-k
[1:00:07] comes from the hebrew word yara and
[1:00:11] this word sides in the hebrew
[1:00:15] means something different than what you
[1:00:18] think it does in the union
[1:00:20] because in the hebrew the word yaric
[1:00:22] means the thigh
[1:00:25] the extreme part feminine
[1:00:28] the loins as a seat of pro-creative
[1:00:32] power
[1:00:33] it means the generative part
[1:00:37] and the word generation is having the
[1:00:39] ability
[1:00:40] to originate produce or procreate
[1:00:44] of or relating to the production of
[1:00:47] offspring and satan says
[1:00:51] i want to be like the most high i will
[1:00:53] exalt my throne above the sons of god
[1:00:56] who was the son of god adam was
[1:01:00] and he knew that god had children in the
[1:01:02] earth and satan desired to be like god
[1:01:04] but he could not create within himself
[1:01:06] so he went to the closest things
[1:01:08] he said i'll go to the skies and the
[1:01:10] others i'll go to the feminine to the
[1:01:13] thighs to the seat of procreative power
[1:01:16] i'll go to the generator parts and which
[1:01:18] it also meant the loins and the loins of
[1:01:20] the lord out of including the
[1:01:21] reproductive organ
[1:01:23] and this word north in the hebrew comes
[1:01:26] from a word that i cannot pronounce
[1:01:27] but it means the treasure or the secret
[1:01:30] place
[1:01:34] and satan says i'm going to do this and
[1:01:37] i'm going to the side of the north i'm
[1:01:39] going to the generative
[1:01:40] part and from there i will exalt my
[1:01:42] throne above the stars of god
[1:01:45] what do you think what's going on in the
[1:01:46] world today
[1:01:48] what do you think happened when cain and
[1:01:50] abel was on earth and king killed abel
[1:01:52] satan was trying to exalt his throne
[1:01:59] above the stars of god
[1:02:04] so satan was in eden using the serpent
[1:02:07] to beguile eat
[1:02:09] and produce life something that he
[1:02:11] couldn't do on her
[1:02:13] own you see through the woman satan once
[1:02:16] again
[1:02:16] seen an opportunity to have what god had
[1:02:21] and in genesis 3 notice this now
[1:02:24] genesis 3 again
[1:02:27] i hope you give me a
[1:02:31] watch more time i'm not going to ask for
[1:02:34] a little bit because i'd probably be
[1:02:36] lying
[1:02:38] but genesis 3 1.
[1:02:41] notice here now let's just actually
[1:02:44] let's just read in verse psalms let me
[1:02:48] see here
[1:02:50] let's just read it read it all the way
[1:02:52] down in verse 3 let's just read verse 3
[1:02:55] for the sake of time but of the fruit of
[1:02:57] the tree which is in the midst of the
[1:02:59] garden
[1:03:00] god has said ye shall not eat of it
[1:03:03] neither shall ye touch it
[1:03:07] lest ye die now
[1:03:11] this word touch this word touch
[1:03:14] in the hebrew comes from the hebrew word
[1:03:18] naga which is naga which means to touch
[1:03:22] or to lie
[1:03:24] with a woman
[1:03:27] it's in your go to your strong
[1:03:29] concordance you'll find these words
[1:03:30] yourself
[1:03:32] it means to lie with a woman and he
[1:03:35] tells them now not to touch it
[1:03:38] now notice in genesis 20 and 6 speaking
[1:03:41] to abimelech which
[1:03:42] took abraham's wife's share god shouted
[1:03:45] to him in a dream yea
[1:03:46] i know that thou didst this in the
[1:03:47] entire integrity of the heart for i
[1:03:49] also withheld thee from sinning against
[1:03:51] me therefore suffered i be
[1:03:53] not to touch her what is he doing he is
[1:03:57] identifying this word
[1:03:58] touch of sexual intercourse in proverbs
[1:04:02] 6 29
[1:04:03] so he that goeth into his neighbor's
[1:04:06] wife
[1:04:06] whosoever toucheth her
[1:04:10] shall not be innocent then in first
[1:04:13] corinthians 7 and 1
[1:04:14] now concerning the things wherefore you
[1:04:16] wrote unto me it is good for a man not
[1:04:18] to
[1:04:18] touch a woman so genesis 3 3 when
[1:04:22] speaking of touching is without doubt
[1:04:24] referring to a sexual intercourse
[1:04:26] between a man
[1:04:27] and a woman and we see by these
[1:04:29] scriptures that touch gives reference to
[1:04:31] such a relation as well as just to touch
[1:04:33] something shall we look at it even just
[1:04:37] a little bit farther
[1:04:39] let's look at genesis the third chapter
[1:04:40] the sixth verse now
[1:04:43] genesis 3 6 and when the woman saw that
[1:04:45] the tree was good
[1:04:47] food and that it was pleasant to the
[1:04:49] eyes
[1:04:52] now let's go ahead and give you a little
[1:04:53] insight on this this word pleasant there
[1:04:55] means lust a lustful appetizer
[1:05:01] so that it was pleasant to the eyes a
[1:05:03] tree to be desired to make one wise
[1:05:05] she took and the word took there
[1:05:09] and the hebrew means to marry
[1:05:13] or to take a why
[1:05:20] and she took of the fruit thereof
[1:05:23] and did eat and gave also
[1:05:27] into her husband with her and he did
[1:05:30] eat now the eat here is speaking
[1:05:34] of a sexual act proverbs 30 and 20.
[1:05:42] proverbs the 30th chapter verse 20.
[1:05:47] notice here now proverbs 30 20
[1:05:51] such is the way of an adulterous woman
[1:05:55] she eat uh and wipeth
[1:05:59] her mouth and saith i have done
[1:06:02] no wicked
[1:06:05] solomon is showing that this woman
[1:06:08] speaking of the acts of adulterous women
[1:06:10] in other words what he's saying
[1:06:11] is when a one when an adulterous woman a
[1:06:14] prostitute
[1:06:15] enters into sexual relations
[1:06:18] she wipe at their mouth which is what
[1:06:20] wife means to blot out of memory
[1:06:22] and saith i have done no week in other
[1:06:24] words she doesn't see
[1:06:26] her sexual asses anything that's wrong
[1:06:32] just said brother chris but i thought it
[1:06:33] was eating apples well let's go to song
[1:06:35] of solomon
[1:06:38] because if you want apples i'll give you
[1:06:40] apples
[1:06:42] i mean i'm not ashamed to give you
[1:06:43] apples because the bible says something
[1:06:45] about apples strongly solomon chapter 2
[1:06:47] verses 1 to 6.
[1:06:52] notice here now
[1:06:55] song of solomon chapter 2 verse 1. this
[1:06:58] is the love story from
[1:07:00] christ comes right now i am the rose of
[1:07:02] sharon and the lily of the valley as a
[1:07:04] lily among the farm so is my love among
[1:07:07] the daughters
[1:07:08] as the apple tree among the trees of
[1:07:11] wood
[1:07:12] so is my beloved among the sun
[1:07:15] i sat down under his shadow
[1:07:19] in other words that phrase there
[1:07:20] actually means i have become
[1:07:22] his spouse i sat down under his shadow
[1:07:26] she sat down underneath the apple tree
[1:07:28] and she's become his spouse i said
[1:07:30] another shadow with great delight and
[1:07:32] his fruit was sweet to my taste
[1:07:34] and he brought me to the banqueting
[1:07:36] house and his banner over me was love
[1:07:38] stay me with flagons which is why
[1:07:40] comfort me which
[1:07:42] the word comfort there is to make me a
[1:07:44] bed
[1:07:46] comfort me with apples
[1:07:50] for i am sick of love and his left hand
[1:07:53] under my head and his right hand just
[1:07:56] embraced me now this is christ and the
[1:08:00] bride and solomon
[1:08:02] he wrote many love stories the roles of
[1:08:06] sharon and the lily of the valley was
[1:08:08] jesus
[1:08:10] in verse 4 it says he brought me to the
[1:08:13] banqueting house
[1:08:14] and his banner over me was love in other
[1:08:16] words he had dinner with her
[1:08:19] then he made love to her
[1:08:24] in verse 5 he gives her wine and with
[1:08:27] their intimacy
[1:08:28] and she declares that i am loved sick
[1:08:32] and in verse 6 it shows their intimacy
[1:08:35] while eating apples
[1:08:42] before she said he says his left hand is
[1:08:44] under my head and his right hand up and
[1:08:46] raising i don't know about you but i've
[1:08:47] never ate an apple that way
[1:08:52] this is a love scene
[1:08:55] a beauty well christ will embrace the
[1:08:58] girl
[1:08:58] which is justification he will kiss the
[1:09:01] girl which is sanctification
[1:09:03] and then he will make love to earth
[1:09:05] imparting his sea
[1:09:07] life which is the baptism of the holy
[1:09:09] ghost
[1:09:10] but yet it is identified and the whole
[1:09:13] relationship is identified in eating
[1:09:18] apples
[1:09:20] you gotta understand the bible is a
[1:09:21] parable
[1:09:24] you see eve committed an adulterous act
[1:09:26] with the serpent and then took what she
[1:09:28] had learned to
[1:09:29] adam and they did the same act and this
[1:09:32] simple act made them realize they were
[1:09:35] naked
[1:09:36] and i'll say this if eating apples lets
[1:09:39] people know they're naked we need to
[1:09:41] pass the apples out again
[1:09:45] amen go back to genesis 3 3 with me
[1:09:50] because i'm not done genesis 3 3
[1:09:54] what are the fruit of the trees which is
[1:09:57] in the
[1:09:57] midst of the garden
[1:10:00] god has said you shall not eat of it
[1:10:02] neither shall you touch it bless ye
[1:10:06] now i want you to notice now of the
[1:10:09] fruit of the tree
[1:10:11] which is in the midst of the garden
[1:10:14] he says you shall not eat of it but
[1:10:16] touch it he's unless you shall die
[1:10:18] now we must understand that the bible is
[1:10:21] full of metaphors
[1:10:23] and a metaphor is a figure of speech in
[1:10:26] which a word or a phrase that ordinarily
[1:10:28] designates one thing is used to
[1:10:30] designate another
[1:10:32] and here in genesis there was a fruit in
[1:10:35] the midst of the garden that was
[1:10:37] forbidden
[1:10:39] first of all it's important to point out
[1:10:42] the trees in the bible
[1:10:44] often refer to people
[1:10:48] i'm not going to read all the scriptures
[1:10:49] but i'll tell you whether that mark the
[1:10:50] 8th chapter 24th first you'll find when
[1:10:52] jesus healed the blind man
[1:10:53] of the sight jesus asked him what he
[1:10:54] said i see him
[1:10:57] walking psalms 52 and 8 you'll find
[1:10:59] again people identified as truth
[1:11:01] song of solomon the seventh chapter
[1:11:02] verses seven eight you'll find i'll be
[1:11:04] speaking as a people as palm trees
[1:11:06] then also in jeremiah 11 and 19 is to
[1:11:08] destroy the tree with the fruit which
[1:11:09] what he was actually declaring was
[1:11:10] destroyed the prophet and his teachings
[1:11:13] and so over and over again from the
[1:11:14] bible people was always identified as
[1:11:16] trees
[1:11:16] but this is the part that i want you to
[1:11:18] see that there was a fruit in the midst
[1:11:20] of the garden
[1:11:22] now go to song of solomon the fourth
[1:11:24] chapter
[1:11:29] song of solomon 4
[1:11:32] beginning with the 12th verse
[1:11:36] because let's find out what this fruit
[1:11:38] in the midst of the garden was
[1:11:41] song of solomon 4 verse 12 a garden
[1:11:45] in calls is my sister
[1:11:48] my spouse
[1:11:52] a garden in clothes is my sister
[1:11:55] my spouse a spring shut up a
[1:11:58] fountain seal thy plants are an orchard
[1:12:02] of pomegranates with pleasant fruits
[1:12:05] camphor with spaghetti saffron and
[1:12:08] calamus and cinnamon
[1:12:09] with all trees of frankincense myrrh and
[1:12:12] aloes with all the chief spices
[1:12:14] a fountain of gardens a well of living
[1:12:16] water the stream
[1:12:18] from lebanon here solomon is describing
[1:12:20] his spouse
[1:12:22] as a garden and he says now
[1:12:26] verse 15 of fountain of gardens a well
[1:12:29] of living one of the stream from lebanon
[1:12:31] awake o
[1:12:31] northwind and come thou south blow upon
[1:12:34] my garden that the spices thereof may
[1:12:37] flow out
[1:12:38] let my beloved come into his garden
[1:12:41] and eat his pleasant fruit
[1:12:48] now in verse 12 solomon identifies
[1:12:51] a woman as a garden and this woman that
[1:12:55] he is speaking up here is the bride of
[1:12:56] christ and the reason why we know it's
[1:12:58] the bride of christ
[1:12:59] is because in this garden it is enclosed
[1:13:04] which this word enclosed is it's it's
[1:13:07] locked and inaccessible
[1:13:09] to all but the owner in other words when
[1:13:12] it comes to
[1:13:13] his spouse to his garden to his wife
[1:13:16] she's she is inaccessible to anybody
[1:13:19] else what he's saying
[1:13:20] is that his bride will not commit
[1:13:22] adultery on him
[1:13:25] that's what he's saying and he said a
[1:13:27] spring shut up a
[1:13:28] fountain shield and when he speaks of
[1:13:31] this fountain being sealed
[1:13:33] he is saying that she is chased she's a
[1:13:36] pure
[1:13:36] virgin none has ever entered this garden
[1:13:39] the seal of this fountain hasn't been
[1:13:41] broken she has preserved the seal
[1:13:44] of her virginity she's untouched
[1:13:49] that's what he's saying concerning this
[1:13:50] garden
[1:13:52] then in verse 16 notice what the bride
[1:13:54] calls now
[1:13:56] the bride calls for the bridegroom to
[1:13:58] come
[1:13:59] and eat of his pleasant fruit
[1:14:04] notice now let my beloved come into his
[1:14:07] garden notice
[1:14:08] in verse 12 he said a guardian encloses
[1:14:10] my sister my
[1:14:11] spouse so let my beloved come into his
[1:14:14] wife
[1:14:16] let him come to his bride let him come
[1:14:18] to his woman
[1:14:19] and eat of his pleasant fruit in other
[1:14:22] words
[1:14:23] then she is telling him that there is a
[1:14:25] fruit
[1:14:26] in the midst of the garden
[1:14:29] and she is inviting him to come to her
[1:14:32] what is she designing she was designed
[1:14:34] to be impregnated with his seed life
[1:14:42] now notice now genesis 3rd chapter the
[1:14:44] 13th verse
[1:14:58] told us what she says now 13 and the
[1:15:00] lord god said unto the woman what is
[1:15:02] that devout john and the woman said the
[1:15:04] serpent
[1:15:04] beguiled me and i
[1:15:08] did eat this word begotten here in the
[1:15:12] hebrew means
[1:15:13] seduce to lead astray morally seduce
[1:15:17] utterly you know she said the serpent
[1:15:20] morally seduced me
[1:15:24] and she was saying that he polluted her
[1:15:27] and notice now as soon as she says in
[1:15:30] verse 13
[1:15:32] in verse 3 we know that there was a
[1:15:33] fruit in the midst of the garden that
[1:15:35] was to be untouched
[1:15:36] and now in verse 13 she said the serpent
[1:15:39] beguiled me he seduced me he pulled he
[1:15:43] polluted me
[1:15:44] then in verse 15
[1:15:51] as soon as she declares i've been
[1:15:53] begotten i've been morally
[1:15:55] seduced utterly two seeds show
[1:15:58] up in which he said and i will put
[1:16:01] enmity between thee and the one in
[1:16:03] between
[1:16:03] thy sea enter see
[1:16:07] it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[1:16:09] bruise his head
[1:16:10] now notice the serpent has a seed
[1:16:13] because that is who he's speaking to and
[1:16:14] lord god said in the seventh and verse
[1:16:16] 14
[1:16:16] because thou has done this above all the
[1:16:18] cattle above every beast in the field
[1:16:19] upon my belly shall they go in the dust
[1:16:21] shout thou eat all the days of our life
[1:16:23] notice he's addressing the serpent in
[1:16:24] verse 14
[1:16:25] continues right on in verse 15 and i
[1:16:27] will put enmity between
[1:16:28] thee speaking of the serpent and the
[1:16:30] woman between thy sea
[1:16:34] the serpent that beguiled her ends up
[1:16:36] with a signal
[1:16:40] now that's what my bible says
[1:16:45] and if you're looking at the bible
[1:16:46] you're just saying the same thing now
[1:16:48] maybe contrary to everything you've been
[1:16:50] taught but it's still saying
[1:16:51] but it's still saying something
[1:16:52] different because the serpent hasn't
[1:16:54] seen genesis 3 15 identified that he
[1:16:56] does
[1:16:57] so the fact is that eve was impregnated
[1:17:01] by both adam and the serpent
[1:17:05] now we're medical reports and i wish i
[1:17:07] would have brought it because i actually
[1:17:08] had an article
[1:17:09] at home in johnson city tennessee where
[1:17:11] i live and i wish i'd have brought it
[1:17:12] now but i don't have it
[1:17:13] but medical reports have proven that a
[1:17:15] woman can be pregnant by twins by
[1:17:17] different fathers
[1:17:18] there has been numerous of cases where a
[1:17:20] woman in one particular case of
[1:17:22] the case that i have the article on is
[1:17:24] where a black man and a white man slept
[1:17:26] with the same woman on the same day
[1:17:28] and she ended up with twins one baby
[1:17:30] come out black one they become that
[1:17:31] white
[1:17:35] it don't happen all the time but it does
[1:17:37] happen
[1:17:38] and it's proven scientifically now
[1:17:41] eve was pregnant with twins one was
[1:17:45] adam's child
[1:17:46] the other was a serpent's child you see
[1:17:48] cain and abel were twins remember
[1:17:50] but matthew 13 the parable of the sowers
[1:17:54] in matthew 13 there is two seeds
[1:17:57] in one field
[1:18:01] two seeds in one field by
[1:18:04] two different showers
[1:18:08] now what was jesus identified he was
[1:18:11] identifying
[1:18:12] something all the way back in genesis to
[1:18:14] try to get the disciples to understand
[1:18:17] why they could see the revelation of the
[1:18:19] word and the rest of them couldn't
[1:18:26] notice genesis 4 i'm gonna i'm going to
[1:18:28] hurry up now and just come to a few more
[1:18:29] points and we'll stop
[1:18:32] genesis 4 verses 1 to 4.
[1:18:36] so many areas that you really need to
[1:18:38] emphasize a lot of things on but you
[1:18:40] just for the sake of time you can't do
[1:18:41] it
[1:18:43] genesis 4 1-4 and adam knew eve his wife
[1:18:46] and she conceived and bear came and said
[1:18:47] i've gotten a man from the lord and she
[1:18:49] again bear his brother abel
[1:18:50] and abel was a keeper of the sheep that
[1:18:52] came with the tiller of the ground
[1:18:54] but notice here now i'll just stop right
[1:18:56] there
[1:18:58] adam knew eve once and she can see
[1:19:02] there was one conception but two
[1:19:04] children
[1:19:05] notice here now what it says again
[1:19:08] and adam knew eve his wife and she can
[1:19:10] see and bear came
[1:19:12] and said i've gotten a man from the lord
[1:19:13] and she again bear his brother abel
[1:19:15] notice now one conception adam knew the
[1:19:18] word new there is a sexual relationship
[1:19:20] i can show you all the way through the
[1:19:21] bible
[1:19:22] and adam knew even his wife and she
[1:19:23] conceived in their cain and said i've
[1:19:24] gotten a man for one and she again bear
[1:19:26] one conception two children by adam
[1:19:28] don't notice this now
[1:19:30] in verse two notice it said and she
[1:19:32] again bear
[1:19:33] there was one conception until verse 25
[1:19:35] comes notice now in verse 25 what it
[1:19:37] says
[1:19:38] and adam knew his wife again
[1:19:44] in verse two in verse one adam neuer she
[1:19:46] produced two children
[1:19:47] the next time we find adam having sexual
[1:19:50] relations with his wife is in verse 25
[1:19:52] when adam knew his wife again
[1:19:53] and she bear seth and seth was born
[1:19:56] so now i wanted to say these and i'm
[1:19:58] going to come to a place to just drop
[1:20:00] all of these things that i've been
[1:20:01] saying and just bring them to a head now
[1:20:03] cain
[1:20:04] was not adam's son
[1:20:08] because he was the seed of the serpent
[1:20:10] how many believe the bible is infallible
[1:20:13] now notice in first john 3 and 12.
[1:20:17] first john 3 and 12.
[1:20:24] first john 3 12. notice this now not as
[1:20:27] cain
[1:20:29] who was up that wicked
[1:20:32] one now notice adam was not
[1:20:36] uh not the wicked one satan
[1:20:41] was the wicked one because remember
[1:20:44] matthew 7 verses 17 to 20 a good tree
[1:20:49] good fruit a corrupt tree
[1:20:52] corrupt fruit you'll never
[1:20:56] blame cain on adam
[1:20:59] right adam or abel was
[1:21:02] adam's child and in genesis 3 15
[1:21:06] you'll start seeing the enmity between
[1:21:08] the two seeds
[1:21:09] and this is the product of their fathers
[1:21:12] the same war that was in heaven in in
[1:21:14] revelations 12 and 9 now comes down to
[1:21:16] earth
[1:21:17] and is now being manifested in the seed
[1:21:19] line
[1:21:20] between cain and abel and through cain
[1:21:22] satan is going to try to exalt his
[1:21:25] kingdom
[1:21:26] above the stars of god cain offered to
[1:21:30] god the thing that was cursed because he
[1:21:32] didn't have the revelation like about i
[1:21:33] mentioned that to you this morning
[1:21:34] now i want to go to genesis the fifth
[1:21:36] chapter and i'm going to show you just
[1:21:38] emphasize some more points
[1:21:39] that cain was not abel's
[1:21:42] adam's son rather king was not adam's
[1:21:44] son genesis 5
[1:21:47] verse 1-3 now notice here now
[1:21:51] this is the book of the generations of
[1:21:53] adam
[1:21:54] in the day that god created man and the
[1:21:56] likeness of god made him valentino
[1:21:57] created them blessed and called their
[1:21:59] name adam and they when they recreate
[1:22:00] adam lived a hundred and thirty years
[1:22:02] and he got a son in his own likeness and
[1:22:03] after his image he called his name
[1:22:05] seth
[1:22:08] now the word this when it says
[1:22:11] this is the book of the generation of
[1:22:14] adam
[1:22:14] the word this means this is it
[1:22:18] there is no other there never could be
[1:22:21] another
[1:22:22] this is it this is the general book of
[1:22:25] the generation of adam
[1:22:26] now it is important also to see in
[1:22:29] genesis the third chapter verse 20
[1:22:31] that the bible said and adam called his
[1:22:34] wife's name eve because
[1:22:35] she was the mother
[1:22:39] of all living but you will never find
[1:22:41] any place in the bible that declares
[1:22:43] adam to be the father
[1:22:45] of all living but it does say that evil
[1:22:49] is the mother of all leaders living
[1:22:52] cain is never mentioned in adam's
[1:22:55] lineage
[1:23:00] he's never mentioned in adam's reigns
[1:23:02] because he
[1:23:04] isn't adam's son jude the 14th verse
[1:23:15] jude 14 notice now
[1:23:18] and enoch also the
[1:23:21] seventh from adam prophesied of these
[1:23:23] saying behold
[1:23:25] the lord cometh with ten thousand of his
[1:23:27] saints now i wanna ask you something do
[1:23:28] you believe the bible is an exact
[1:23:30] record and it cannot and it cannot
[1:23:32] contradict itself
[1:23:34] and so here the jude under inspiration
[1:23:36] begins to prophesy and said enoch also
[1:23:39] the seventh from adam now i want you to
[1:23:42] go to luke the third chapter
[1:23:49] we're almost done we're just hanging
[1:23:50] this a little bit longer
[1:23:53] luke the third chapter verses 37 and 38
[1:23:55] now notice this now
[1:23:57] which was the son of methuselah which
[1:23:59] was the son of the now if you'll start
[1:24:00] counting from enoch now here's the
[1:24:02] generation of adam the genealogy of adam
[1:24:04] and remember this is it there is no
[1:24:05] other never could be another this is it
[1:24:08] and under this genealogy you will find
[1:24:10] that it is
[1:24:11] from enoch which was the son of jared
[1:24:13] which was the son of melio which was the
[1:24:15] son of canaan which of the son of enoch
[1:24:16] which was the son of said which was the
[1:24:18] son of adam which was the son of god
[1:24:19] from adam to south you'll count it
[1:24:22] you'll start you'll see one
[1:24:23] two three four five six seven
[1:24:27] which makes enoch prophecy right enoch
[1:24:29] also the trevor from adam
[1:24:31] all right when he says it when he says
[1:24:33] this now when jude prophesied this
[1:24:36] enoch also the seventh from adam so now
[1:24:40] enoch is exactly the seventh from adam
[1:24:43] but if cain
[1:24:45] were adam's son
[1:24:49] then they would break the continuity of
[1:24:52] the word
[1:24:55] now cain in fact had his own
[1:24:59] lineage genesis the fourth chapter if
[1:25:02] you want to look at it later genesis 4
[1:25:04] 17 to 23 you'll find out
[1:25:06] that cain had his own lineage he never
[1:25:07] was even in the lineage of adam because
[1:25:09] he never was adam's son
[1:25:13] because a serpent morally seduced
[1:25:15] utterly eve
[1:25:16] and then she ended up with his seed so
[1:25:19] the bible said
[1:25:22] now let's go to second corinthians 11.
[1:25:28] second corinthians 11.
[1:25:32] there's a few more scriptures
[1:25:37] verses two and three notice here now
[1:25:42] here paul is speaking now concerning the
[1:25:44] church but notice how he
[1:25:45] begins to address the situation of the
[1:25:47] church and notice what he reflects back
[1:25:49] upon
[1:25:50] for i am jealous over you with godly
[1:25:52] jealousy
[1:25:54] for i have espoused you to one husband
[1:25:58] that i may present you as a chaste
[1:26:01] virgin
[1:26:01] to christ but notice verse 3 now but i
[1:26:04] fear lest by any means of the serpent
[1:26:08] begotten even through his subtility so
[1:26:09] should your mind
[1:26:10] be corrupted to this from the simplicity
[1:26:13] that is in christ
[1:26:15] in verse two spaul speaks to presenting
[1:26:17] us
[1:26:18] as chaste virgins
[1:26:21] virgins to christ with one husband
[1:26:24] remember
[1:26:24] the bible said that eve took of the
[1:26:26] fruit and the word took there
[1:26:28] was to marry or to enter into marriage
[1:26:31] in other words
[1:26:33] he actually took her a second husband
[1:26:36] more or less
[1:26:38] because she took him to something that
[1:26:40] was only giving rights to her husband
[1:26:43] and here paul now addressing this he
[1:26:45] said but i fearless by any means the
[1:26:46] serpent begotted
[1:26:47] and he speaks presenting us as a chaste
[1:26:49] virgin to christ but in verse three said
[1:26:51] that he fears
[1:26:51] that we would be begotten the same as he
[1:26:53] was you see paul was afraid that the
[1:26:55] church would lose their virginity the
[1:26:57] same as eve did
[1:26:58] when she walked out on adam and
[1:27:00] committed adultery
[1:27:01] and this is why eve was in the
[1:27:03] transgression and not adam
[1:27:07] first timothy 2 14 and adam was not
[1:27:09] deceived but the woman being deceived
[1:27:11] was in the transgression
[1:27:13] now why was adam not to see but the eve
[1:27:16] but the woman was deceit and she was in
[1:27:18] the transgression
[1:27:18] this word deceived here in the greek
[1:27:21] means to wrong from safety
[1:27:23] help and virtue to cheat to seduce
[1:27:27] holy in other words adam was not
[1:27:31] deceived adam did not
[1:27:32] cheat on his spouse
[1:27:36] but the woman being deceived
[1:27:39] was in the transgression adam was not
[1:27:43] deceived because evil was his wife and
[1:27:44] he had rights to her body
[1:27:46] as a husband and eve committed an
[1:27:48] adulterous act she was the one who
[1:27:49] roamed from virtue
[1:27:50] let me just say this to you eating an
[1:27:52] apple never caused one pregnancy
[1:27:57] i want to ask you a few questions as i
[1:27:59] close now
[1:28:04] if it wasn't sex in genesis
[1:28:08] then why did god curse the woman
[1:28:17] if she ate someone and god cursed him
[1:28:19] now
[1:28:25] here's another question to really think
[1:28:26] deep on now
[1:28:28] why was the covenant that god made with
[1:28:31] abraham
[1:28:33] in his private party because he come to
[1:28:37] abraham and give abraham a seal of
[1:28:38] circumcision
[1:28:40] now god could have god could have given
[1:28:42] him an azerite vow let your hair grow
[1:28:43] along
[1:28:44] god could have put a put something in
[1:28:46] his place god could have done anything
[1:28:48] but when god come to abraham i made a
[1:28:49] covenant with abraham
[1:28:50] and was telling abraham i'm going to
[1:28:51] take this is my seed life
[1:28:53] god comes to abraham and he says i want
[1:28:55] to make a covenant with you but i want
[1:28:57] it to be a steal
[1:28:58] of circumcision i'll answer the question
[1:29:01] for you
[1:29:02] because that was where the seed passed
[1:29:05] from
[1:29:07] and the blood that come from the sill of
[1:29:09] circumcision was a sign
[1:29:11] that the blood of christ would cover
[1:29:13] adam's seedling
[1:29:23] one more question composing this why did
[1:29:26] jesus have to come before her
[1:29:33] the answer he bypassed the sexual unions
[1:29:37] that brought death to all the first
[1:29:40] birth
[1:29:40] produced death so the second birth had
[1:29:43] to produce
[1:29:44] life and jesus in john 3 1-7 he deals
[1:29:49] with the element of birth because the
[1:29:51] first act is what
[1:29:52] brought death so the second one had to
[1:29:54] bring
[1:29:55] life he could not come
[1:29:58] by the way that sin entered into the
[1:30:00] world to expect
[1:30:01] he had to bypass that to be able to take
[1:30:04] us out
