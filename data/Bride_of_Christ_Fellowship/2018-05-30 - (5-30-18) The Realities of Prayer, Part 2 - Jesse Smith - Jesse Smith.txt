to the prayer series tonight by God's grace let's go to first Timothy chapter 2 I like to look at prayer this is only part two of this series I started that back in April fourth and I haven't got back to her since then so I had a lot of notes on that so I want appreciate tonight by the grace of the Lord trust everyone was real stirred up from the meetings on this weekend I just thought God just spoke in a tremendous way and brother Joe was so blessed to be with all of you and he was he said just have such a wonderful church to preach to you and I said that's right I sure enjoy preaching in this church and you're such wonderful people you pay attention you focus on the word and you pull on the word and yeah you smile and you laughing you clap and cry and I appreciate that by the grace of the Lord he's just a wonderful time with us and so I like I said I invited him back he'll be coming back the last weekend of October by God's grace I want to make sure I get him right back and just really appreciate his ministry by God's grace so first Timothy chapter 2 verse 1 I'll be our text it's the same text we used back on April 4th we started this by God's grace so I've read four chapters in this book by II M bounds and I've been pulling thoughts out of there that of course line up with the message in the Bible and so that's where I'd kind of draw my inspiration from by the grace of the Lord last week I preached on you know learning and then that's one way I've been learning is through this book by God's grace 1st Timothy 2:1 through 4 a wise man can always learn more by God's grace and he'll love you more if you correct him thank God for that I want to be corrected by the Holy Spirit praise God 1st Timothy 2:1 through 4 for there say Amen I exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men for kings and for all that are an authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior who will have all men to be saved and come unto the knowledge of the truth amen let's just bow our heads in word of Prayer if you have a need on your heart just make it known unto God here tonight Heavenly Father we are grateful Lord to be in your presence we're gathered here in your house of worship and we know there's nothing holy of itself in this place except your Holy Spirit so father it's your spirit that makes us a holy place and thank you for visiting us here tonight I feel your presence I feel the sacredness of your spirit and Lord we give you glory and honor for that Lord God Lord we know that you promise to meet with us so Lord we ask that you fill our cups we ask that you feed us Lord and lead us by still waters Lord God and feed us in green pastures Lord Jesus Shepherd us here tonight Lord for we need your grace and mercy Heavenly Father speak to us through this the word and Lord bless every heart and soul that's here hungry and thirsting for righteousness that made sacrifices or to show everyone what side they're on here tonight Lord God we give you all the glory honor and praise in Jesus Christ's name I never said Amen you may be seated god bless you praise the Lord so I just have a few few slides and I'll be preaching off some notes that I took but let's look at part two here this is part two like I said and we started it back in April I haven't got back to it but I kind of been reading in there and hoped would be a blessing to you tonight we read our text and like I said I've been drawn inspiration from e/m bounds he lived in the late 1800s and into 1900 he wrote numerous books on prayer he was a preacher and an attorney his books are free Ani sort if you want to read them I've really been blessed by them they've really been a challenge to me and then I've read the first four chapters now and I've been really blessed on those by God's grace but first I just want to make a few points about this weekend and I just want to share just a few things from my heart I just thought I thought again we heard from heaven you know I wanted to say that again I thought that like we heard from heaven I think I was almost crying almost the whole services both services were so tremendous just because I've been going through battles and I've shared them with you know the last few Sunday nights when I preached actually when I preached on the test of life I shared a little bit of the battles been going through and different things like that but it was very helpful and I hope I hope by God's grace that everybody saw how important it is to in prayer to speak the Word of God in prayer and to fight with the Word of God there's so much truth to what brother Joe was preaching a lot of the things you probably if you're honest you've heard before right but applying them to our lives is what we need a lot of help with by God's grace and that's what we need reminders for and so this weekend my prayer closet in prayer time I've been quoting more scripture and fighting the devil with Scripture I've you memorize a scripture I memorized Romans 5:1 therefore you justified by faith and now you have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ I've been because I've been battling having this war you know and so I was memorizing that scripture quoting it and driving back the enemy by God's grace I hope you were as well by the grace of the Lord so I've been enjoying that and I want to say to you know brother Tim her brother Joe's ministry is very powerful because and that's where and that's what I was thinking too that's how powerful the Evangelist gift can be because we know we know that God has the fivefold ministry and we know that that complements all the other four gifts right and it was such a blessing to have him come in here because I do a lot of teaching that's kind of nice that's kind of the gift God's given to me and it was great to have him come in here and that's what evangelist is supposed to do he's supposed to come in here and stir up the people and he's supposed to get out of the city like Philip did in Samaria and then go back to where he was and he was just really elated to be here and it ties him perfectly you know he was saying you know we can we can get so caught up on teaching right he was saying how you can get caught up on deep things and that's true you know sometimes people can go too deep on teaching and things like that and I appreciated that because some people when they when they teach on things they don't teach people to get to the cross so what I mean by that is like he was saying you could teach on the seven seals but if you don't teach on that and at the end of it point them to the cross to show all those revelations with the the four horse riders and then the the four anointings if we don't use that and then point the people to the cross it's just gonna be teaching and it's not going to be applied to our lives but I know I know how many times has God broke me when I'm just teaching on a Wednesday night God has broken me and helped mold me and shape me and draw me to repentance or draw me to Thanksgiving or move me to worship or move me and to praise and adoration or rejoicing and so see that's what that gift is to do is to stir us up but all that gift really does it complements the other floor and if they all work together it turns into a wonderful ministry right it turns into the ministry that Christ said this ministry is going to be here until every bride member is fully mature amen like in Ephesians chapter 4 so we appreciate brother Joe's and ministry very much I just couldn't thank him enough for coming and ministering here and remember brother Branham said you know when when you hear teaching he said that really puts your roots down he says that gives you a foundation so teaching when we teach the Word of God like on a night like tonight your roots are supposed to go deeper right in the Lord and when evangelist comes that he's supposed to stir you up praise the Lord so see they they both work work perfectly together and huh me know this too how many know that miracles can even happen in teaching let me know that what was the series brother Adam taught the deepest revelations they would remember the seven seals remember that brother Bram said and he said never in my ministry have I experienced a greater ministry than the revelations in the seven seals come any number that if you listen to the sixth seal questions answers on the seven seals and the seventh seal brother Branham says that over and over and then he talks about how leukemia was healed that week and all these miracles were healed during the preaching of the seven seals when God is teaching he's still doing the same work by the Holy Spirit so even on a night like tonight God can have healing tonight right God can have you just like they're with brother Branham but he said his greatest meetings when God would openly reveal the revelations and the need teach him to the people praise God those were his greatest services that he said that's according to what he said and I believe that because remember the Holy Spirit visit him every day and shorten those revelations so I just want to make sure I say those things that that's a great compliment brother Joe's ministry is a great compliment we have other evangelists like Qadri Diggs we have brother bender are coming next month and then we have brother Keith ran off the month after that he's an evangelist these these evangelists are supposed to come in here and stir us up and brother Joe even told me he said if the people weren't saying Amen or shouting on Sunday he said I could not have preached because that's the only way my gift operates so I'm glad nobody was falling asleep on brother Joe because he even admitted to me said I couldn't preach like when I go to places and people don't Amen and shout or clapper cries to my dad he said I can't preach nothing gets done because there's certain gifts you have to pull upon that gift right now it's we know it's good to Paul on all the gifts but he said his gifts especially if the people don't get it behind it enthusiastically and they don't raise their faith it's hard for it to operate we're very grateful I just want to say again I really appreciated that ministry by the grace of the Lord now let's go to skip ahead now on part one I never finished the part one I had a couple more scriptures I want to go down to the realities of God so if you got your Bibles I just want to encourage us on this the reality that God records prayers in heaven I just want to go back to the reality of this as we look at this just for a few moments here by the grace of Lord let me spend time I think last week I forgot so forgive me I just and I'm really tired this week I got a headache right now I just just I'm not good enough sleep and whatever got too much to go on I've but God can touch me Amen mate perhaps they'll be gone by the time I'm done all things are possible amen God's my healer a man I quote the Word of God I'll fight the devil off amen remember there's this is the reality of this in acts 10 4 the Bible said and when he looked on him he was afraid and said what is it Lord and he said to him thy prayers and 9 arms are come up for a memorial before God this is Cornelius talking to the angel that visited him he said what is it Lord he calls the angel Lord and he said prayers and alms are memorial before God so there's some there's some memorial there's some witness that we have been praying aren't you glad about that now your prayers there's some witness in heaven that you've been praying other churches might be skipping the prayers or maybe they're just making long pretence of prayers like the Pharisees they only like to pray at church but when you pray you're supposed to go in your closet how many like to do that and when those prayers are praying and of course here when they're sincere but when those prayers go before God there's some record of them in heaven and God remembers them let's go to revelation 5:8 and then we'll read these scriptures here sorry I went the wrong way my Bible revelation 5:8 par me okay this is in the the chapter where Jesus takes the seven sealed book verse eight and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of the Saints praise gods I'm not sure in this case who had the vials it looks like the beasts had the vowels but they have there's golden vials and that striking God put your prayers in a golden vessel that's how highly he values our prayers amen they're not know would one they're not an earth one ceramic they're in a gold vessel in heaven that's where our prayers go aren't you glad to hear your prayers let's go to chapter eight now chapter eight is the last time the Bible mentions the word prayer because of course it goes to end of revelation 22 you know so revelation eight is the last time prayers are mentioned I want you to see what's happening here in other words God is fulfilling every prayer every prayer is gonna be answered somehow maybe not the way we wanted maybe not in the time we wanted but it's gonna be answered somehow revelation 8:1 and when he'd opened the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven about the space of half hour now I'll just stop right there I personally don't believe this silence has happened yet some people do but brother Branham mentioned the silence in heaven and he said he said the reason it was silent he said because Jesus went down to the air to meet the Saints in the in the rapture brother Graham calls him big fellow he says where is that big fellow then when there's silence in heaven he said he went down to meet the Saints in the air so I believe this happens I believe the actual revelation or the loosening of the seventh seal takes place at the moment of the rapture that's when it's broken or release in its reality form because remember all three seals have three forms right symbol reality and I can't remember the other one but there's three forms for a seal okay now look at verse two and I saw the seven angels which stood before God and to them were given seven trumpets and another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden censer and there was given unto Him much incense they should offer with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the Saints ascended up before God out of the Angels hand so these prayers are now applied to this altar in heaven it's like an altar of incense in heaven and then this smoke goes up before God okay so the prayers are being poured out the prayers are all going to be answered praise God God is gonna hear those prayers and God is going to answer them very swiftly because look at the next verse verse 5 and the angel took the censer and filled it with fire of the altar and cast it to the earth and there were voices and thunderings and lightnings and earthquakes and the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound we know the trumpets all sound during the Tribulation Period and this is the last time prayer is mentioned in the Bible so all the prayers of all the saints and all these golden vials are poured out before God and God smells them how many know the Bible says that our lives are sweet-smelling savour unto God God loves to smell our prayers now that's you know in allegory form and he loves to experience that you're praying to him you're seeking Him you're trusting him amen now I want to look at some thoughts here I don't have these on slides that was actually my last slide but you can just take it off maokai so I'm just gonna be reading off these other notes I didn't have time to put all the notes on here so I do apologize about that but let's look at the notes I want to quote John Wesley here because chapter one or I'm sorry this book by e/m bounds on the reality of prayer opens up with a quote from John Wesley our our messenger from the sixth church age look what he says he said I am a creature of a day passing through life as an arrow through the air I am a spirit come from God and returning to God just hovering over the great gulf till a few moments hence I am no more seen I drop into an unchangeable eternity now look what he's saying here you said your Lea said my life is like a arrow that's being shot over a chasm you see it for a while but then it vanishes he says this he says I want to know one thing the way to heaven how to land safe on that happy Shore God himself has condescended to teach the way for this end he came from heaven he hath written written it down in a book he said oh give me that book look at the desire of his man he said at any price give me the book of God Lord is it not thy word that states if any man lack wisdom let him ask God now give us liberally and upbraideth not thou has said if any be willing to do thy will he shall know I'm sorry he will know I am willing to do thy will o Lord let me know your will and quote hey man and that powerful a church age messenger realizes my life's like an arrow so short I just want to know how to land on heaven shore hey hey man so give me that book give me that wisdom and he recognizes the way to get the wisdom is to ask for it through prayer amen that's what I preached on Saturday brother Samuel asked me to preach on Saturday morning so I preached Saturday morning and I preached get wisdom I preached that thought and I got some good testimonies back from that but I was trying to get the children to see if you can get wisdom getting wisdom is like getting the baptism of the Holy Ghost because if you get wisdom the Bible says you have life and we know the wise virgins of course they're wise because they have oil and oil represents the baptism of the Holy Ghost so John Wesley saying the same thing that the Bible says if you're going to do anything make sure you pray ask God for wisdom make it to heaven God has given us and showed us the way to get there let me know that way I'm willing to do anything to get to have it amen I like that beautiful thought right there now let's look at supplication for a moment chapter one then goes into supplication that's Daniel chapter nine here I just like a look at this thought for a little bit the word supplication means a more intense prayer it means more restricted and more intense form of prayer accompanied by a sense of personal need and it's limited to the seeking in an urgent manner of a supply of a pressing need okay so let's look up supplication and I'm sorry I'm looking to back up and then it's in Daniel 9 the supplications use probably four or five times in Daniel 9 I preached on that last year you probably member last year at this time so let's go to Daniel chapter 9 it's in there four times so I want to just remember remind you of the the realities of Prayer and one of them is supplication you have prayers you have intercession or intercession we all knows what for somebody else oh brother Adam I'm really gonna pray for you brother Jesse I really pray for brother Aaron I'm really gonna intercede for you that's when you pray for somebody else but a supplication is a need that you personally have that's extremely intense for you you've got to have this okay so Daniel chapter 9 now there in verses 3 17 18 20 23 I'm sorry there's five of them but let's just hit the context here let me get there here alright Daniel chapter 9 verse 1 alright this is the vision of seventy weeks and the first year of Darius the son of has you eros of the seat of Medes which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans in the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years where of the word Lord came to Jeremiah the Prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolations in Jerusalem isn't that great you see how he was reading The Book of Jeremiah and God gave him the revelation that's why we said last week we've always got to read the word we got to read Bible books we've always got to keep reading the Word of God because that's when the revelation struck the prophet of God as he read the Word of God as you read Jeremiah that's when it struck him as he read verse three and I set my face unto the Lord the Lord God to seek by prayer and supplications with fasting and sack cloth and ashes so it's prayer and supplication again supplication now let's go to verse 17 now Daniel praise and he confesses all the sins of his and then he confesses all the sins of his father's and all Israel verse 17 now therefore o our God hear the prayer of thy servant and his supplications and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate for the lord's sake amen verse 18 oh my god incline thine ear and hear open my eyes and behold our desolations in the city which is called by thy name for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousness but for thy great mercies hey my head in other words I'm not intensely praying because I'm righteous I'm intensely praying because I know you're a merciful God amen how many need a merciful God Oh mah constantly we need a merciful God and Dave is recognizing this remember he just confessed everybody sins his sins his moms and dads his forefathers his his country's everybody said he confessed and now he's saying Lord we're something we're giving supplications because of your mercy now look at verse 20 and why lies praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel presenting my supplication before the Lord my god for the holy mountain of God and you ever think about that look he has to present a supplication but church did God know what Daniel wanted already of course God knew what Daniel wanted God knows what you and I want right but God tells us to ask anyway because prayer is an expression of your faith the Bible said you have not because you ask not to see God knows what your what you and I are going to ask for before we already asked but God still wants to see us approach and pray in faith to prove our faith that we do believe in God amen and that's what Daniels saying here he knew you realize I had to come to this place and I had to present my supplication God knows my heart but God also wants to see me present my heart to him praise the Lord and that's what God wants to see with you and I God just wants to see our hearts it's not about how long we pray and church you know it - it's not about how loud we pray it's just about bearing your heart before the Lord letting God see the very inside of you letting your faith and letting your you know your struggles come out you know and just being honest with God did you realize that about prayer remember how David and job both David and Joan went through awful trials and tests but if you read their prayers there they're just being honest with God they feel like where's God where are you Lord well haven't you answered my prayer God never sent them to hell God understood they're human and they're going through a difficult time their faith or their faith may be wavering but at least they're crying out to me right and not bail or astronauts like Solomon did you know that's why David was more faithful than Solomon and God got angry with Solomon not so much with David other than the sin with Bathsheba and Uriah will see God God got remembers that were just flesh and blood and God wants to hear us cry out because that's what they he had to present a supplication so your greatest desire of your heart think about it what would it be the greatest desire your heart - to see all my family my children baptized with the Holy Ghost that's the greatest desire in my heart and so God wants to see that presented before him God wants to see me and my prayer caused it go in there and present this is my supplication Lord let your will be done because remember we can't force God to do anything right God Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated you no matter how much Isaac and Rebekah prayed for Esau he wasn't gonna be saved and I don't laugh like that in a bad way but just say like there's nothing you could do about it God knew he saw would despise the grace but the point was God still wanted to see your faith remember Jesus still had a burden for the rich young ruler even though he went to hell he looked at him and loved him remember that the Bible said he looked and loved him Jesus even called Judas friend to see has Christians we should even we should especially love our enemies as well we have to if we've really got the Spirit of Christ we'll love our enemies and this is expressed in prayer now there's one more so see this is a chapter where it's a extremely high concentration of supplication Dan separates himself I want to know your will forgive me forgive my family forgive my church forgive that the nation of Israel forgive all of us it's not because of our righteousness is because of your mercy and he's presenting a supplication before God this is his personal prayer this is his intense form a prayer and I'm sorry I lost that little piece we fell off brother Joe gave it to me it's at my house I forgot to bring him back here so sorry it's a little bit more sensitive Daniel 9 23 so Gabriel touches him in verse 21 and then informs him that he came to give him skill in verse 22 now verse 23 at the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth and I am come to show thee for thou are greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision see God loves people that present their prayers before him amen God loves people that will pour out their hearts and pull out their souls in prayer unto God because they're going to God for help they realize they can't get help from man huh me no you can't trust men you can trust there are some Christians but but for the most part you can't trust men in general we've got to put our trust in the Living God amen now let's go to First Samuel I want to look at a Hannah's prayer samuel first samuel 1 you remember this she was praying so hard she Eli thought she was drunk look at verse 14 first samuel 114 oh that's what that's that's the kind of prayer that needs to pour forth from our hearts Eli said unto her how long wilt thou be drunken put away thine wine from thee she could have said I just had the new wine right she could I'm just drinking the new wine Eli don't you know about that of course he'd say no cuz he was back slipping he didn't eat and then had that anointing like I verse 15 and love this and Hannah answer said no my lord I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but have poured out my soul before the Lord amen hallelujah praise God this is what Daniel did this is what you and I have done right through prayer I have come here and God knows my heart I've literally poured out my soul to God I've cried until snout runs down and it falls on a tissue and I've got a scramble to get a tissue I poured out my soul for the church that God would help our church to be a book of Acts Church I poured out my soul for my family that they'd all come in the message and be born again I poured out my soul to be a full-time pastor I have I pulled out my saw blade on my face and said God this is what my soul desires but at the end I always must say let your will be done not mine because brother haven't taught us clearly prayer is not changing is not about changing God's heart it's about God changing our hearts a night remember the one man who did pray change God's mind but it didn't change cause mine was Hezekiah and then he didn't do good with what he did after that he basically messed up his extra 15 years because we just read that a few wheat Sunday nights ago so the one man who supposedly could move God and God no doubt hurt his prayer but it didn't change God's mind God just knew it was gonna happen and God orchestrated that way the one man who actually saw that happen he squandered it he didn't do like he should have done so ultimately Church the greatest thing we can pray is let God's will be done not mine that is the greatest prayer and it has to be when brother Joe was preaching on Sunday remember what he said he wouldn't listen to the point I brought up when I came to the pulpit we must only speak what God is leading us to speak because we're supposed to speak the word speak the word he got power and speak the word speak to her go fight Goliath but remember brother man said David knew God showed him a vision he was going to defeat Goliath so that's why he could speak the word and so see same thing for us we must speak the word that we know God has revealed to our hearts right remember brother Graham said I never asked to speak squirrels God told me to speak squirrels I just want to remind us with that with prayer because if we if we're not careful with Sunday's message we'll just start speaking well I'm gonna be a millionaire or I'm gonna be the principal and next year you know or you know to mean things you might just want but not know you don't have the perfect will of God on there to say what I'm saying so we've really got to be careful how we speak the Word of God because it's not about my will it's about God's will and then he got many times what does God do Church you know and I know it he makes us wait for it he makes us suffer because it's through learning it I'm sorry through suffering that we learn just like Jesus because like I told you this before but I've know numerous people who said I claim this woman for my wife and they didn't marry that woman it's really sad they were just trying to speak the word you understand they're they're trying to speak it but not have the revelation behind it and that's why you know on Sunday I didn't speak I didn't come up here and you know try to get you and I to say certain things I tried to get us to practice and you I believe for my healing I believe for my big drive I'm overcoming discouragement simple things like that but when you start getting into quoting certain things then you're being you're if you're not careful you're almost prophesying and we don't want to be false prophets at Bride of Christ fellowship well Graham said the sky is full of so much real let's wait till we get something real then talk about it let's not try to impersonate it let's get our lives in prayer let's get excited about the word let's be devoted to prayer let's be prayer warriors and then the revelations will come and then we'll speak something amen that'll be a true revelation from the Lord and I like what joe said to remember joe was praying he said i speak life to the church how many want life to the church we want more life we're thankful for the life we have I know I'm alive I don't know about you I'm not dead I know that for sure I'm alive in Christ Jesus I'm just little tired and discouraged and worn out but now I'm encouraged by God's grace through the word of the Lord see because the Bible said I have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ I'm not at war with God I have peace with God because I'm justified by faith see quoting the Word of God now I hope that's a clear example and so the supplication David sorry you know rather he has an intense need and so we see the same thing here with Hannah and I had this intense need and she poured out her soul before the Lord oh just struck me see her prayers being poured out just like the prayers get poured out in heaven in the golden vials ha ha ha hey man there's something with this prayer as a pouring forth of your soul amen that's beautiful thank God for His mercy now intercession then is a childlike confidence in asking for others you intercede for others am bound says intercession is an enlargement in prayer a going out in broadness and fullness from self to others so when you're supplication it's all about I'm just pouring this out from my soul but when you intercede you're actually leaving yourself and you're reaching out to pray for your life or pray for you husband or pray for your family it's actually a reaching out but a supplication is I'm just pouring this out before God that he hears it that's a good visual to understand that pouring out for supplication versus interceding reaching out like Abraham reaching out to save lot amen not but it means he says primarily does not Center in praying for us are primarily as centers and praying for others and refers to the freeness boldness and childlike confidence of the praying amen it is in the fullness of confiding influence in the souls approach to God unlimited and unhesitating in its access and its demands this influence and confident trust is to be used for others humming no also it's a lot easier to pray for somebody and believe for somebody more than yourself I mean know that it's easy to say oh brother Adam come on hum pray for you'll be well come on brother speak the words have faith to be healed but when I'm sick that's a whole different story you know that I know that that's why speaking the word is so important of course because there's life and death in the power of the tongue but you got to be careful what you speak but intercession here is childlike confidence asking for others Lord I just know you're gonna do it I know you're gonna help so and so and you just you go beyond yourself and you move out and you begin feeling the needs of others hallelujah I want to look at this Vermeer let's go to Hebrews five seven just another familiar scripture like I said I'm rehearsing the realities of prayer Hebrews 5 7 and I just want to emphasize these are the thoughts when I read the four chapters that really bless my heart now before we read this I want let me read what am bounds wrote here I like this he says prayer always and everywhere is an immediate and confiding approach to and a request of God the Father in the opening universal and perfect prayer as the pattern of all praying Jesus said it is our Father who art in heaven so the universal prayer is spoken to our Father at the grave of Lazarus Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I thank thee that thou has heard me always he says prayer to the father as always personal familiar and paternal in all praying now let's look at Jesus's prayers this is what his prayers look like to his father who's in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared so church we know there's times where jesus prayed so severely you know at the cross you know where he was before the cross and the gardener cuz cemani he was praying drops of blood but before that even before that he would pray and he would have strong crying in tears now think about your life I'm not here as your hand but when was the last time you prayed with tears you were just so burdened you were so you were you so one of the father to hear you that have brought tears to your eyes and you wept and cried this is how our Lord cried I'm sorry this our Lord prayed and cried rather help me want to pray like that amen I want to pray like that I do pray like that from time to time I really enjoy those kind of prayers this is what Jesus gave us for his example strong crying tears unto him that was able to save him from death amen next thought here that's a good thought so it's always to the father it's always paternal it's always looking to the heavenly Father now how many of you parents when your children ask you for something and you don't give it how many you like it when they whine and stomp their feet and they don't they're not happy with your no how many how many parents like that does anybody like that here oh look there's no hands sugar there's no hands so see that's how we are to God right we pray to God and we say the Lord we're crying to God God I need this God I need this God I need this what if God says no does God want us to show a pity party does God want us to complain about it well God didn't hear my prayer no that's why we got to end the prayer with let thy will be done not my will we've got to end it with that and always remember that it is God's will that's most important nobody likes a whiny brat II child and I used to be one I'm sure you did too maybe not maybe you're more mature than I was I used to feel bad I just have sulking party sometimes I do still feel sorry for myself sometimes I got to get Mick to get over that from time to time and I'm sure there's times in prayer where I'm not you know I I want something really bad and it hasn't happened yet and maybe I'm a little impatient but God is using the fires of that trial to burn that out of me so the next time I pray even if God doesn't answer I can still say okay father you know best Oh dad or dad can you go buy me a brand new Lego box litter you don't like Legos anymore what do you like Lenny now close books daddy can you buy me this series of books no Lydia I can't oh that's okay dad I still love you anyway that ought to be our answer right to God Oh Lord can you heal this person they're dying of cancer right it's pretty pretty serious need Lord could you save my father's soul or my mother's soul or any need and the Lord would say not now we all say well thank you Lord anyway I trust you Lord God but see the thing God wants to see God wants to see us sincere prayer and he wants to see us pour out our requests present our requests before him God wants to see our faith God wants to see our souls can I say it like that he wants to see us pour forth our souls in prayer amen that's right I love Wednesday nights we get to come here and pray and I'm in charge that and I can pray if I want as long as I want but I appreciate your patience but that's what I love about prayer because it's so personal and God is collecting them in the golden vials amen hallelujah remember prayer is all about worship and asking and receiving so just as we ask we expect to receive we just got to be patient when to receive it now let's go to a few scriptures here let's go to James 1:5 again just just repeat Hebrews and James were right there in Hebrews let's just review some of these as well it's very helpful to me I don't know about you but when I preached it on prayer or read on prayer it helps me pray better because I'm focusing on it it's right on that's right under the throw forefront of my mind it's all I'm thinking about is prayer prayer practice what you preach live what you preach be a real man of God James 1:5 if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that upgraded to all men liberally I'm sorry they give it to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him now see there's that word liberally that's why brother Brad I'm like Joe is quoting brother Branham that's my brother Graham could say ask abundantly ask God for big things you know what brother I hope brother Joe is okay with me sharing this he was telling me the testimony of his church hum you know evening like Tabernacle in Louisiana he told me when he moved in that church he said they were just content me in a small little country church and he said brother brother Joe said God felt it put him on his heart like you need to expand this church you can have a worldwide influence you this church doesn't have to stay small he said he told everybody there he said if you think small you always gonna be small as it makes me laugh cuz we're a small church but God could make us larger right but he said he kept planting those seeds in there and then pretty soon the internet got big and so brother Joe installed all the cameras for live streaming and then he said after that people started moving in from all over the nation to support their work and now they just built a brand-new Church it's got 500 seats in it and they hold meetings every year and there and he said they're there Easter youth meetings that now he said they had I think about 450 people there on Easter for the youth meetings he said they just started off with like 20 or 30 people and God just got blessing it blessing it and blessing it and growing it and growing it I thought my that we just have to ask God and God will give it liberally now the thing for our church is like this this is what I think when he tells me those things here's what I think I think well that's wonderful if it's God's will for us right because my man said God likes a variety I can show you the scripture I don't have a right for me but I can show to you the Bible said in cleese asking God's makes God makes one man rich and God makes another man poor so if God makes you poor there's nothing you can do to get out of your poverty but if God makes you rich there's nothing you to get you new you get yourself out of God's richness right the rich do some of the money so he's ever understand what I'm saying I don't want to be limited with limited thinking while you're just thinking too small bro Jess you know I don't want to Adam and Magnus in the meeting with me and say you know here's just a small thinker yeah that's why our church is so small like I don't want that but I do want to know what does God think about it that's what I want to know and that's why if we do outreach and pray if Adam and I on bang if we just pray and say God lead us you know then we'll see what God does now if God gives Adam a bang a revelation or something like that and they know God's gonna grow and build a church will praise the Lord but what I'm saying is that that was God's will and now God is using Tim Pruitt and his preachers on a worldwide level they're starting to almost starting churches in Japan where Japan never had these messy churches ever and God is using that church to spearhead it to support it financially and the gospel in Japan after all these years 2000 years it's getting in partly because of their church and then amazing because that was God's leadership of God anointed Joe to have that vision to do that and now they do churches all around the world I mean they go Europe Asia New Zealand Australia they go out there they can send people everywhere but remember brother Tim has been pastoring over 50 years I next this Sunday is 12 years for me pastor and so it's 50 minus 12 38 I got 38 more years to catch up just kidding but you understand what I'm saying like in other words God he has planted so many seeds he's now seeing the harvest and we might and I said Joe tommy said you're you guys are just in the infancy stage of a church we want to start a church not because we wanted to because God led us to and we're planting we're doing a lot of planting we're doing a lot of breaking up the fallow grounds right we're just trying to get the ground ready for planting and plant and putting the seeds in there and trusting that the grace of God will grow this into a more mature larger church by God's grace that we can do more work on a worldwide level if it's God's will but it always has to be God's will because remember Jesus even prayed he said fear not little flock I mean there was little flocks big flocks I mean there's gonna be big churches little churches I don't want to limit us with little thinking but I'd also don't want to go outside the perfect will of God so hope think everybody understands I want I don't I don't wanna try speaking a big church or try speaking more Souls I just want to ask him and let God do his will like brother Branham said I just want to get myself in such a sanctified spot I believe I'm born again but stay sanctified that God can use me anytime he wants to use me or they wants to send me to New York send me to Iowa send me to North Carolina to do some work and then come back have me stay in Akron picky pastor and I'm happy I just want to do whatever God calls me to do amen so liberally God gives liberally so we must ask liberally if we're feeling led that way but God knows why we're asking now that's the main thing God knows why we're asking for what we're asking for because we're sickly verse 6 this is where it tells the plainly but let him ask in the face of see we can't ask for it we have to ask for things that's in faith that we know is God's will nothing wavering for he that waver there's like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed you know what my you know you know what word I've been speaking since brother Joe preached I was really having a battle like oh should I speak my mother and father be saved he was anybody thinking about that during service - should I speak you know certain things should I speak this or that you know you know what I've decided to speak in my prayer life I decided speak this I'm returning to my first love by my first works because I knew that's God's will for me I knew it's God's will for me to return to my first love because I feel like I've been discouraged I've been discouraged I'll be honest but the brand was honest he lied there's times brother brand was down and discouraged if times brother BAM you know went through hard times I'll be honest I've been discouraged and I know my heart's not in the condition where it needs to be in the first love because I've let myself be discouraged so I know it's God's will for me to return to my first love and because I know this church if I return to my first love everything else will take care of itself amen if God saves Souls if God does miracles if God increases the church or whatever God does takes people away it doesn't matter if I return to my first love I'm walking the perfect will of God and my heart will be pure before the Lord that's right and I know that's the perfect will of God is return to my first love you get over my tiredness my discouragement whatever I'm going through / me so asking and receiving go hand in hand we must ask and then we'll receive if we believe we will receive liberally God will pour out his blessings all right now let's go let's I want to go to this thought here I want to skip ahead a little bit here's another quote from am bounds and then I'm getting close to closing yeah man is the one more immediately concerned in this great work of praying it's an and Nobles man's reason to employ it in prayer so we must use our reasoning in prayer so prayer helps us to reason and understand why do we do this or why should we do that or what should we do the office and work of prayer is the divinest engagement of man's reason did you catch that the way to increase your reasoning well here's the reason I'm gonna go this go this way or go that way here's the reason I'm going to go do this the very way to engage your reasoning the best is through prayer in other words prayer will give you the right reasons to do what you're doing praise God it'll lead you with the right reasons it'll give you the reasons to obey the Word of God and walk in the perfect will of God he says this he says prayer makes man's reason to shine intelligence of the highest order approves prayer listen this he's the wisest man who prays the most and the best prayer is the school of wisdom as well as of piety day men when did Daniel get all the answers for all of his prayer oh when attend and again all the answers for his questions in prayer correct the angel came in prayer all those answers came in prayer so prayer those who pray the most are the wisest people on the earth now remember we said this few weeks ago we're not in the competition I'm not trying to be more wiser than you and you shouldn't be trying to be more wise than me but we should be trying to be more wise than ourselves right we should be crucifying the lusts of the flesh and the affections thereof and trying to live a more godly life I need to be more wise I need to be wiser than I was yesterday I need more wisdom than I had month so the wisest man and woman is the one who prays the most and the best in other words those who are pouring out their souls those who are expressing their thoughts before God those who are interceding for others like I think of that one guy that a preacher in Illinois he said to pray for me he said I've been bleeding when I used the restroom and then I prayed for him that night my family prayed for him and he emailed me back the next day and said God must took some time out of his busy schedule to hear your prayers because I come back and have a full clean of health and I'm not bleeding anymore by God's grace that encouraged me because that's what it were supposed to do we're supposed to ask pour out our hearts for that man pour out our heart for that woman and expect to receive Oh and it's a blessing when we receive it right away it's a huge blessing so this is the school of wisdom prayer is the school of wisdom this is how you get wisdom as James said let him ask if he needs wisdom ask of the Lord hallelujah all right let's go to another thought and then I want to get back to that thought let's go to Matthew 523 Matthew 5 23 this is quite a I can thaw I just want to drop it in because it actually came in Chapter what chapter is this chapter one yeah so came in this order so I'm just going on the order I took notes in here Matthew five twenty three now in verse 22 that verse 22 Jesus teaches that if you have the spirit of anger with someone without a reason it's the same as murder and he could go to hell so we can't be angry with people without a reason and if we got a reason we need to go tell them a reason right we can't just hold it in like that don't let the Sun go down upon your wrath now look at verse 23 therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar and there remember that thy brother hath ought against thee leave there thy gift before the altar and go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift so this this scripture is to point out dealing with prayer that we must have unity with our Brotherhood before we can actually have unity with God never to catch that this man cannot offer a sacrifice to God until he's made one with his brother as ever understand it so that's what the Bible says as well if you pray and the Bible said if your heart can you you can't expect to hear from God God's not gonna hear your prayer God's not gonna answer your prayer but Jesus plainly teaches here that if we are ready to offer our gift and remember that our brother has something against us we need to leave church and go make that right now let me say this don't wait to get here to leave on purpose oh I know I did something wrong against my mom at home well I'll go to church and then I'll say that I've remembered it there and then I don't have to go to church tonight let's not do that that then God knows your heart even more right thank God knows your heart is not even in it in the first place but this is the case where the man didn't even remember it but once he got to offer his offering Jesus said oh he remember oh my brother's upset with me maybe I didn't pay him back right away he said leave your gift there go make it right go pay him go make it right then come back and offer the gift praise God so this shows that prayer as you get to as you come to offer your worship at the church as you're praying as you're interceding our prayers are only going to go as far as our relationships with others does that make sense if our relationships aren't in good order in the church then God's not going to hear our prayers we have to treat one another with love and respect forgive one another all these things we must love everyone right and then God will hear our prayers is that is that alright now let me I want to share a thought here and I hope it helps you out I'm gonna be real careful I say this that my timer oh no I'm gonna call from Florida forgive me I'm just calling me from Florida I want to share this thought here with community this is a thought about communion I want to make sure I wear this the right way I want to speak this in love this is all with love in my heart so there's times we know communion is a judgment seat right in other words when you come to take communion it's like coming to be judged the Bible said you judge yourself right brother Branham says like a showdown so when we come to communion now we're not having communion anytime soon but I may call it maybe I don't know I'll see how I feel lead all right this is your thought I just want to I want to connect communion to this thought right here everybody could understand this I hope I can say it the right way help me Jesus before communion comes we should make everything right before communion so we don't have to miss communion does that make sense so all right no communion is this Sunday oh I've got this against my boss I've got this against my wife my husband has this against me we shouldn't say well I'm gonna skip communion and then just well maybe it'll work itself out that's that's that's not a good reason there's miss communion praise the Lord Jesus said when you remember you've got sin go to that leave Church I'm not telling you leave Church like I said don't leave Church unless you just remembered if you just remembered yeah you can leave Church but I wouldn't encourage it you might miss a blessing but if it's in jesus's case he's talking about yes you would leave it at the altar you go make it right but you know what you should slip out in the hallway and make a phone call if they don't pick up you should come back and service that's what you should do but listen the point is we should make everything right before communion we should not sit out of communion and not make it right jesus's whole point is so you can go make it right instantly and then come back and God will receive your worship never understand okay just because I've known people in the past people I love wonderful people godly people wonderful people but they just they'll go to every service except Communion and Lima at Sheffield I've known people they're different people albian they'll sit out of communion but they'll never make things right they'll come to every other service miss Skip communites not right is that right that's not right because jesus said if you know someone has it wrong against you go talk to them then come back so for example with us we have communion at Sundays at 4:00 p.m. whenever we have it generally well if you know you're not fit for communion you want to take the time from 1:30 to 4:00 to call somebody on the phone and make it right and then you should be here at 4:00 for a communion and the church said if not you're not doing what Jesus said you're letting it in there and that you're letting that since they uh you're letting the Sun go down upon who's ever and whoever is upset does that make sense and I hope I expressed that in love I guess that's the love of God in my heart because that's how it connects here our prayers are hindered if we don't have unity with the Brotherhood but it's not an excuse to skip Church it's not and the whole point of this scripture right here so you'll instantly make it right if someone's upset with you if I know Aaron's upset with me I need to go make that right if I know I hurt Adams feelings I need to go make that right right the point of this is to make it right not to skip Church the point of this is to make it right so you can come back and have Church and God will hear your prayers does that help by God's grace that was all my heart I just want to make sure I didn't have that in my notes but it just kind of struck me right here because I was think I was meditating on that a few weeks ago and it's interesting the Lord brought it up here tonight by God's grace so I hope whether live streamers or archives or here hope that was a blessing because that's been kind of hovering and meditating on my heart the point of this scripture is to quickly make it right and then come back and worship then gotta hear your prayers alright let's close with this I just want to close with one more thought by the grace of God let me find I got to skip down okay here it is okay yeah I'm gonna read this and I'm just gonna tie this thought in with brother Graham's quote about a real man okay so I you know I I'm taking everything am balance says back to the Bible never understand that I'm thinking everything he says back to brother branham's just so you know I'm pulling a but for brother branham just give me a moment here there it is okay I got it all right now I'm ready now here's what um balance says prayer is the real work how many know that how many want to work today you know what that's really not about your real work if you went to work today for the Rams or the Bible well the Bible teaches prayer is the real work prayer is vital work prayer has it's keeping the very heart of worship there maybe the exhibit the circumstance and the pomp of praying and yet no real praying right people can come to church they can be real pompous and pious and there could be no real praying going on at all because who's pouring out their soul to God praise the Lord who's interceding for others there be there may be much attitude gesture and verbage but no real praying that can happen Jesus taught us that if we just repeat the same prayer over and over and over again it's just the waste of Prayer what is this prayer to which men are called is it not a mere form a child's play it is serious difficult work I like this here he says the manliest the mightiest work the divinest work which man can do amen can I say like this it's the most womanly thing a woman can do it's the most feminine thing a woman can do is pray in the Holy Spirit amen the manliest thing I can do and you brothers can do is pray in the spirit that's the manliest thing you can do he goes on to say this prayer lifts men out of their earthliness how many can say amen to that hallelujah and it links them with the heavenly praise God it connects you to heaven when you really pray and pull out your soul supplications or intercede it links you up to heaven you feel like you touch heavens throne amen that's because that's where your prayers are gonna go one day how do ya praise God men are never nearer heaven nearer God never more God like never in deeper sympathy and true partnership with Jesus Christ than when praying and the church said you're never more manly you're never more like God you're never more like Christ than when you're pouring out your soul to God and praying and interceding for other people there's nothing more manly you can do love philanthropy holy alliances all of them are helpful and tender for men are born and perfected by prayer amen so helping people all these things loving people that's all great but it's all started with loving godly prayer you know I have some friends that go to a mega church in Fairlawn and yes Memorial Day they raised $60,000 to feed starving children in Africa but my question is I wonder was their prayer behind that I hope there was by God's grace and they said every year they raised for the first year they raise ten thousand then 30,000 and 40,000 not $50,000 and I hope they're praying behind that that's what we need to do we need to pray and say God show us who he can help show us who he can feed right show us see we're never more like God than when we're interceding for other people right God show me how I can help Lord make it plain I can help this person financially maybe I can help this person with my time maybe I can help this person with my wisdom or the teaching or the gift in my life show me someone I can help let's we should pray for that tonight before we go show me someone I can help with the heart of love and I want to close to the quote you remember this from brother branham this is in service we would see Jesus 1961 you never judge a man by how big his hands is and how wide his shoulders is I've heard them say oh he isn't a man I've seen men that weighed 200 pounds didn't have an ounce of man in him that's right you don't measure a man by his size that's Brut you measure him by his character there never was a greater character man than Jesus Christ a mule stouter than any man so he or elephant so that'd be Brut but a man's not how big a muscle he's got I don't measure him by that but how the bags is in the knees of his trousers when he's been praying that's the man that's to be measured character let's stand to our feet by God's grace I thought that'd be a blessing we know and I know you've heard that quote about the trousers before but why don't we just revisit that by God's grace why don't refresh that in our lives in our homes and I know then that faith brother Joe is preaching about then it'll be more effective won't it all the faith and speaking the word and power of the word and speaking of all these promises of God that will only be effective if we prayed first how many can say amen to that it is the real work of your life church it's the real work of my life God measures our character by how much we pray how much we intercede for other people let's close with that by God's grace Malachi you can come I want to pray that God to show us more people we can help all right you like I said I'm thanking for these churches can raise Ski imagine $60,000 and one day they raised now I don't know like brother madam said they may have the wrong spirit behind it I don't know but one thing is if we pray how many know God will hear our prayers too and I'm not here to raise a certain amount of money I'm just here to find God's will for my life what does God want me to do who can I help how can I look beyond just Jesse Smith how kind of look just beyond my family and try to reach out and help somebody else who needs help that's my prayer tonight interceding for others of course also if you haven't given a supplication before God recently and poured out your soul before God I know God would love to have that presented to him don't you think so God would love for you to present the supplications he loved to have you present your soul before the Lord amen let's bow our heads for a word of Prayer here let's pray for those things that we spoke about Heavenly Father we just come reverently Lord God or what I'm not just repeating words here tonight Lord God I'm just not taking up the church's time tonight Lord God there is a throne in heaven or that one day all of these prayers Lord God will be poured out upon I love you Jesus and we're not here to be Pharisees we're not here to be seen or heard if we were we probably go to a bigger Church or God we are here to be better Christians we are here to apply the Word of God to our lives father I pray for
