[Music] hey Matt Brase law Thank You Lord Jesus [Music] praise be to God amen Saints everyone happy to be a Christian this morning a man serving the Lord despite all your battles everything that looks negative God called you to this message your thee this group of people is the only one in the world that understands what's going on the only one that has the truth of all truths science can't compare psychology can't compare in a lecture or anything cannot compare with this truth anything you need to know that's very truth of it is in the Word of God that's just that's just what it is that's the laughs that's when you stand this morning all the rock of Revelation the very truth the very mind of God you've captured he sent it to you specifically hand-delivered it to you by a prophet of God and he's went off the scene he's as my duty is God I've preached I preached I taught I've taught I feel that I've yielded now it's up to you what will you do with it now we must live it we must live it that's what we're to do so I you may have your seat so Jessica want me to give you a little report here of Thailand we had very very good meetings this time I did actually brought an entire PowerPoint presentation and I showed it to the children last night and let them know what we all did and what God did over there we went over there by faith we had two meetings lined up that was it in two weeks and brother Ron down very very gifted brother as far as Facebook and the Asian computer thing called line instead of what's happens there's line and he communicated on their with Google Translate and he was able to meet we we sewed every day except one day we got online made we made contacts with Bible studies did Google Translate back and forth taught on baptism all these things very good we've got all kinds of invitations come back the trip in December we ran into a interpreter that didn't like us so well well sure enough we ran into him again and I just dropped the old original sin service he'd bomb and he just absolutely loved it he said brother Simon this is the first Bible say something and so we made many context with many translators two or three really solid ones and they really liked our teaching we taught them something new you know and that's what you and I'm just kind of I'm seeing that you just go there and teach things that may be blessing to us it doesn't move them it's almost like and you hate to do that but almost bring like something new to the table something they never heard something fresh that'll actually shock them maybe put them make them think that maybe maybe I don't know at all you know maybe this or that you know and we did very good by the grace of God he below really blessed us and but then I we got wind that there's a lot of different beliefs in the message there's a lot of different factions and sects and divisions in the message and but of course but Ron's watching Facebook very carefully on what's going on over there and we noticed that somehow people are getting a hold of our contacts that we made this last trip invited them to their services and and from what I've heard this the certain brother or brother is there they teach things a little bit different they do not believe the Malachi 4 7 is brother Branham you know I'm sorry your 10 seven revelations revelations 10 7 is not brother branham they don't believe that they don't believe in using a church age book at all there's other many many differences he's kind of made a name for himself by a certain quote and the message which the Prophet never interpreted so learning to battle these things and have just been praying as the Lord you put this in order you put this man in his place and I'm not saying you know hell or anything yet but Lord straighten him up to know as my brother Sam would say when he'd get angry he said Simon I tuned him up the Lord you tune them up you turn us all up you know get us all on the right harmony of the Lord Jesus Christ we've been there now a fire that was our fifth trip there for me was not as taxing as the last last trip just about slew me but we had really good really good and went really good we made tribal people I got to witness to them and then the last trip was in Phuket and a very very beautiful area very gorgeous area tropical area and I went in there and I taught on Mount Transfiguration and the pastor went up and said he said he said Church did not I just preached three weeks ago on Moses and Elijah being the two prophets in revelations 11 he said but I didn't know there was another Elijah to come and then that night we were able to share with him William Branham left him everything we could with the messages and I and I left it in his hands after service I called the pastor up I said no church this is your pastor I'm not your pastor I don't the answer for your souls I have to answer to what I'm teaching you but if your souls he has to answer for them and now we've showed you the things hidden in the Bible some things hidden mightily in there and then now he has you better you better pray it over you know make sure so and I did it real reverently let him know I'm not here I told him I'm not here to take your church over I'm not here to do this or that I'm just here because I am just a teacher showing a little bit deeper revelation in the word that's all I'm here to do there is no motive to get into be anything over here so I'm just here to show the Word of God and to bring them what was brought to us so I want really well I would thank you for your prayers and your support and the sister Wendy my offer still stands it's the sister Wendy ever wants to go to Hong Kong and and deal with your people I'd be more than happy to go a few interpret so if you could say it's pray for sister Wendy that God would lead her in the correct way it is in a late hour this late hour and it's an extreme sacrifice you're probably like brother saying why did you say that well we all gotta lay down pray and fast on it brother Jose I'm sure you'd be more than willing to go to wherever you you came from and you speaking Spanish pretty well and if you really if you feel the leading man we got to go it's late our saints of God I buy the last couple months I've been like woo and it's like feel like any moment the rapture could happen I'm like in Lourdes I might ready or I want to be ready I believe I'm right believed your word I believe I received The Bachelor the Holy Ghost I believe this and this but Lord it just seems like it's steadily on my heart I don't know just a real burden lately and it goes I goes and brother Jesse you say you've been preaching on cycles and it comes and goes you know some days I think I might be a couple years of stem and then recently it's like man it feels like any any minute so anyhow this this the the the the trip went well I don't know when we're gonna be back I don't know how to fight someone incoming rain right behind you and teaching the message just in a different angle and I and I will say this I'm trusting the Lord one thing I've learned over listening to a couple things I've heard some nuggets I'm going to teach one one tonight a nugget that the Lord gave me and it really boosted my faith God is in full control nothing can happen absolutely nothing can happen except God allows it anything I'm saying anything in your life any trial it is all under control so all you have to do is wait and pray wait and pray that is it there's no worries here hey no stress hey no stress lines here if he's gray hairs just because I'm getting old it's not cuz stress well I'm saying about faith but you understand I'm saying nothing God is in full control he as he held those seven stars in his right hand to control those two prophets and five Reformers he holds us in his hand the entire world his economy his plan is all in his hand and we know our God has a mighty right hand hey man so let's let's stand we'll just read a little bit of word we'll give you like a seven minute presentation little rehearsal if you want to see the PowerPoint on our trip we could show you here to you sometime we could always come back and at the night time and give you a power point on on a projector whatever if you want to see what we did and where your prayers did went and I'll just keep her on and prayer he he's a you know he's only got so much vacation time and he's only got seven days left so he's brother I don't know if I can go another use this year I'm like well so the Lord leads you know when this woman take off any time Lord allows so we'll go whenever so if we could go to revelations three and 15 I've been I got wounded a long time ago probably bout four or five years ago I got wounded real heavy something was says things were done and then just absolutely it's Lumi it really left a scar I bled and bled in my heart and I would it would scab over then reopen and it was it took a long time and I and I was listening to a couple services that the Lord I believe sent to me and it completely cured me healed me a complete healing of it and but through that circumstance that trial I went through it was it was and one thing I heard on these sermons is there's a difference between killing somebody at war and then killing somebody at peace and what took place was a time at peace for me and it was supposed to be a time of peace and I got wounded in a time of peace and but through that experience the Lord has opened up the deeds of Nicolaitans to me like I've never seen it and and I and I'm on the hunt for the Antichrist spirit the last five years I have the Lord has fully dealt with me on the Antichrist spirit hunting hunting it down looking at every angle I'm on the trail I want to be on that trail I want a hunt I want to as the Prophet was gonna preach the trail of serpent I want to I'm on that trail on the hunt I want to identify the spirit I want to know everything I can about it I went to a discern it really discern it you know and that's uh that's kind of where I'm at and then the a couple months ago only a month ago brother cam want me to preach I had nothing and then the Lord opened this up to me he was on the way to church so I wanted to share this with you I got to service and I tried to put it together and the devil might computer when he hardly worked back there so I know it was a battle Satan did not like this so anyhow revelations 3 and 15 notice what God says he says I know thy works and for you young people my precious nephews and nephew and niece is here as you grow up into Christianity and you know I believe you all been baptized I think in serving God with all your hearts you don't know what you guys just do to me when I come and see you and I see you growing up and you're gonna have to go into these battles and you're gonna see hard times you're gonna see tough time you're gonna see life but they're Jose life is tough they earn just Wendy amen life is tough and you're gonna want to everything your dad and mom has lived before you you're gonna want to store all these things in your heart you're gonna have you're gonna want to keep these things dear to you never let your guard down spiritually love with all you got give everything you got give your life away and do your absolute best but here in Revelations 3 it says I know thy works notice Christ is dealing with your works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou wert cold or hot let's go now to 1st Corinthians 11 this is a I'd say this is a communion style here opening here I don't think believe this is communion today brother Jess I don't believe so but I want to read this first Corinthian 1120 when you come together therefore into one place this is not to eat the Lord's Supper in eating everyone taketh before another his own supper and one is hungry another is drunken what have we not houses to eat and a drinkin or despise ye the Church of God and and shame that have not what shall I say into you shall I prayer craziness the craziness Eve dat the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do and remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup he says when he had supped saying this cup is there the New Testament my blood you do that uh this do ye as often he drinking reverence me for his off you eat this bread and drink this cup you sure the Lords of death till he come right in verse 27 wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of Lord and then here in verse 28 says but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep let's say a word of Prayer approach the throne of grace and mercy dear Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we just love thee or we want to lift you up Lord and Lord as we gather here Lord the Prophet said Lord that the talked about the unrecognized friends of God Lord we are you we know Lord through your word that you are here Lord we may not feel you or see you Lord but Lord we believe you're here and Lord God Lord we want to worship you this morning and truth and spirit and truth God will bless the here is Lord of this little humble study God and Lord Jesus we just love you we lift you up Lord Lord you're the great one God Lord and you've done everything God Lord you can do God Lord and you're just waiting for people to rise up Lord and accept everything Lord and take it Lord in their hand and run with it Lord we just love you so much Lord bless the people God or just say with you to have through me Lord we just yield ourselves each one of us Lord we just yield ourselves Lord to the spirit God we ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may have your seats kind of a broken heart of their Jewish I would've got to see sister Connie I heard she's back in action and she's a precious lawyer and we appreciate all this this church here and thanks of God don't ever get down by quantity quality's everything if you can just get a handful of warriors that are set aside to the word of word of god alone that's all you need you put God than the myths just a one man and look what God can do God said one man a prophet in our age one man set one man full of the Holy Ghost and fully yielded and where are we today hundreds and hundreds of message searches around the world are all staying pure to it no but there are message churches they are doing their best according to their revelation and cording to their understanding so today I'd like to teach on examining yourself I'd like to say this this little quote here honoring this quote here and the prophets pre Keys bringing it in discerning the body of the Lord he says he said there they are he says these women he's bobbing off their hair the Bible says a woman that cuts her hair he says her husband has a right to divorce her he says he's because she's untrue he said that she dishonours her head is that right he says a no man is the head of the woman I know that's rough pieces but we need discernment saints of God not only just discernment out and what you see from their B's about within our own selves so we want to be able to sermon tis not a natural thing the true discernment comes from the Holy Ghost it comes from the Holy Ghost teaching you his word yeah you must read the Word of God you must study this message because in this message then this word of God that was this interpretation gives you all that you need in this day if God wouldn't give you if he needed you to know anything else he would have sent another message you would have sent another messenger you would have sent something else but notice he sent this brother brother Branham and this is the revelation he caught these are the things that God showed him these are the things that God anointed him to see any stood forth so what does that tell you if it was good enough for the seventh angel is good enough for what the bride in the seventh day he meant absolutely he says we need to discern up biases by the word he says the word is right takes the Word of God he says God's Word is always white right he says he says we can't discern by what people think don't lean on man's like this interpretation or his revelation unless it lines right up with the word and you all here are trusting in your pastors revelation and he catches from God that is right and we believe those things that's how that's the correct order he says he says we can't discern by what people think when intellectuals tell us he's what psychiatrists tell us we've got to go by what God says man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God amen amen so we're gonna teach on that tonight as well dealing with that little study we had on last Wednesday he says he says now he goes brother the Prophet goes he's not discerning Lord's body he's as many are weakly and sick many are asleep dead spiritually dead in the churches they can't raise their hands and worship God they can't run through the aisles they can't do these things and then just say Amen or praise the Lord he said they're spiritually dead even though intellectually they're right in line they know the course they can probably quote him and memorize him better than you or all these things he says he says but they are spiritually dead he says he says remember the last plague that hit Egypt was death the last plague that hits the church the last plague that hits the church is spiritual death god help us what we need today is a spiritual awakening a spiritual awakening to discernment saints of God if if this is the age the promise said what the Bible said in Matthew 24:24 if this he says it'll be so close to discern the very elected is that supposed to take place in this day or is that the next thing there is no other age this is the last age so if there is a discernment we need it's in this we're sitting at a certain restaurant one day and a brother came and brought in evangelist and the man just is like he's sitting there he is he's a Baconator or whatever is eating a double and he said and he's in his area czz it's kind of talking with us there and he's like he's like guys over and he was stressing the the deception of maybe jeffersonville you know and saying those things and and i looked at him with puzzled eyes I said brother is that gonna deceive you is that is that gonna deceive you bro is that is that is that stressing you is that is that challenging your faith and he went like this I said brother it's gonna be a lot closer than that he said oh I see what you're saying and I said my goodness come on man mercy wake up this is you'll see by the end what I'm talking about he says he says the last plague is spiritual death we need a spiritual awakening to discernment he says he says these might people have done this he's always good intentions remember good intentions pave the way to the hell as well good intentions must be weighed discernment and I since the fire had good it looked like they had very good intentions amen and the Prophet went on to talk about how the doctor gave a certain serum to a man and the man died he said he said if he though he had good intentions they healed a man if he woulda had better discernment on his medicine that man when it died absolutely sure but now notice here I want to go to Galatians 1 in 6 and I want to bring this forth I don't want to keep it too we got two services but I want to go now we're at about 23 here 23 minutes in Galatians 1 is 6 notice for st. Paul this is in 60 ad supposedly in history 60 80 this is after what the start this is at the church had fallen she'd fallen from grace all from them pure 20 years from 33 AD 253 AD which is the pure a God was fully leaning and in the church was alive and firing is what we're coming back to after she had fallen by one of the Antichrist spirits and 53 ad goes into now the first church age we see now Paul picking up a text here in Galatians and in Galatians 1 he says I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel he says which is not another reason but there be some that trouble you and pervert the gospel of Christ what is he talking about what is he dealing with there must be something here he says but though we or an angel from heaven preach I know these are very common scriptures we use these things to teach God and we use the scripture to teach our baptism why because it draws the line absolutely in other words you can't say anything appreciating consarned what Paul preached he says which is not another but their son that trouble you preserve the Gosling's but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached let him be accursed Emsley so we must stay with the Word of God amen let's write a must line line upon line here and there a little bit a precept upon precept all those things in Vanilla's back to the word keep it pure keep it as simple as you can if you can teach the deep things simply teach you mana but if you if you can teach the deep things simply stay away from a demon he says as we said before so now I say again if any man preach any other gospel to you that we should appreciate he says so these people and Galatians in Galatians from Galatia he says he said they were removed from the gospel the true gospel already right he says but I certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached after me Nancy Paul says he says he says why did you leave it he says the original teaching the original services he's the original interpretation of the Word of God that God gave me this was not after me he said it was by revelation Amen he says for I received it neither of man he never what remember his testimony he said this did not come from Peter when I received the bathrooms of the ghost and was baptized called by God on the way to Damascus he said I did not confer with flesh and blood he says he says but I wish I I hadn't gone to Arabia for three years and received the direct revelation of the word of God being a prophet amen and he caught the word and he wrote these marvelous interpretations amen he said linen verse 16 says to reveal his son in me they could see who he was so close to Christ that people said he said they would a game and they put out his own eyes and gave them to him they treated him as what even Christ himself as the angel of God a man what a testimony he says neither went out to Jerusalem them he said then he three years he was and then after those three years he went into with the desert place into Arabia and verse 18 he says then I went to Jerusalem to CPN as the prophesy teases him and Peter came together and their doctor lined up perfectly at dovetailed right absolutely he said they knew the words we must have the same mind the same judgment on doctrine circumstances situations those kinds of things a man we must all have the same thing if a certain situation came up to the church and the Bible says maybe bring somebody up and brother Jesse says brother Aaron what do you think we ought to do here we're the Aaron's discernment for the amens determined for the Jose's discernment the way you would handle the situation we should be the same way brother Jesse when you look the way they see that they examine a certain maybe an argument between two people or in a couple or whatever and brother Aaron should say well according to scripture this this this is this for the Jose he would say well according to Scripture this is this for the Jesse said that's exactly what I was going to seat you see even though they may not be si o or yet called went to the ministry or not ministers or whatever their judgment must be the same it should be exactly the way they handle things should be exactly the same or very close he meant though different vessels the same spirit the same revelation the same you can actually have this I talked to a pastor the other day he called me and I asked him about that situation of Thailand he says I said brother how why do they get off he says they know the message right here but they don't really understand it when they teach that Malik four or five and six is not revelations ten seven how do you get that there is there is I did a probably a 15 minute study when I found it because I had I got hot when I heard this ice house man I was like let's go and see what the message says within within just the seals he said that three times Malachi 4 5 & 6 is revelation said 7 he says it specifically then after the seals in questions and answers the question is brother Branham is Malachi four or five and six revelations ten seven he said yes a direct quote yes what message are they reading what message are they studying how can I an absolute tiniest of all tiny teachers find this out in five minutes either they're doing this deliberately or they are in total ignorance or they really don't understand the prophecy the trishy book he says he says it's a shame that many ministers do not learn to say just what the Prophet says and to stick just with what the Word of God says amen so here is Paul he's coming his diseases I went up he says in Galatians 2 now in Galatia still doing with the Galatians he glazes 2 he says I went up by revelation notice he says these Galatians are fallen he's a communicating of them that gospel I preached unto the Gentiles but privately to them that a were a reputation lest by any means I should run and head or run in vain and then as he's there he's dealing with he's he says but neither Titus who was with me being a greek or is compelled to be circumcised and that because of false brethren unawares brought in who came in privily to spy out our Liberty we have in Christ Jesus that they might bring us into bondage so these Galatians have been watts now Paul is dealing with a fallen to bondage they've been taken they went off the beaten path or into the beaten path and they've not stayed true with the word of God to whom we gave space by a or placed by subjection no not for an hour should even deal with these people for a night not even now or you ain't give a chance even no no this is not the Word of God you're not called that the truth the gossamer continue with you now look here in number a chapter chapter two verse 11 and notice even Paul Peter at this time had now fallen even after now the church has fallen now the ministers are starting to fall in there I say in there a character in there in their ways that they are conducting themselves in front of the church pieces but when Peter was come to answer I got Antioch Antioch Jesus Iowa stood into the face because he was to blame for before that certain came to James he did eat with the Gentiles notice what he would eat with the Gentiles but as soon as the old group the old Jews come in what he he said well he's well now he's I better stick with my old but he says instead of the new guys and what he dissimulated from them he says but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision oh my know destroy did not draw the Girt in a circle bigger he was dealing with he started his own groups he says he says and James did the same thing and the other Jews dissembled likewise with him insomuch that Barnabas was also carried away in his notice all Holy Ghost filled men carried away with this idea carried away with this action carried away with the Antichrist spirit because that would be Nicolay attend ISM that is a indeed notice there's no snowfall staggering went out just by deed just by movement just by action they parade themselves pieces bought and sold they won't not operate according to the truth of the gospel I senator Peter before them or if thou being a jew delivers at the mention of gentiles and do not add the jews why compels style the gentiles to live also live as do the jews to live as do the jews my so he's rebuked him right he says in verse 15 we who are jews by nature not sinners of the sinners of the gentiles knowing that a man is not justified by works of the law why would the jews separate themselves with Gentiles because the Gentiles were not circumcised which was what came from the Old Testament that was a shadow that was not the real it was a shadow and they're living in the law the shadow the law right there is that we might be justified by the faith of Christ and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified no matter what you do you're not justified we are justified by faith in Jesus Christ amen that is it I do not frustrate the grace of God sister Wendy right he would have grace of God why is the grace of God followed you all these years because something you've done no you believe it you have faith something inside of you call this God gave you faith to believe this word why do I believe it I know he gave me their faith I believe it and I'm trying to live it I'm trying to Oh bad I'm doing my very best learning this sinful for my yes that's exactly the that's what God's looking at is their faith in His Word Abraham fell and fell and fell but they sent by his faith in His Word became the righteousness of God because he believed God's Word God imputed it for him as righteousness amen that was it not his works I do not frustrate the grace of God for righteous came by the law then Christ is dead in vain and notice what he calls it here in Galatians 3 104 she's still dealing with that same church the same group of foolish Galatians who hath bewitched you yes we're dealing with witchcraft is witchcraft always the people in the dark with the circle or the the chalk circle and this the little pentagram in the center they're sitting around with candles and is that pure witchcraft that is not pure witchcraft because in witchcraft deals with the spiritual realm and were Satan is a religious person he's a religious being he knows the Word of God the highest form and I heard about a priestess a highest form of witchcraft is right in the church is right in the message of the hour I say like that and you'll see by the end of this who has bewitched you what is this bewitching this witchcraft that ye should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth crucified among you this only would I learn of you receiving the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith he's saying just simply trusting in any of your own merits well let's say well I I do get to teach it by the Jesse's church by the Kam's Church well God surely he's gonna let me into heaven no that has nothing to do with it these are just little sacrifices we can make these are just little DS and humble so humble of a little tiny I mean micro sacrifices compared to what Christ did for us these are light afflictions spiritual sacrifices we make for our King and we love him for it but we can never count anything we've done nothing I don't care how great a ministry may be it doesn't mean anything do they still just are they trusting in their ministry and my trusting in the good works that I try to do for others now we're supposed to do good works correct Paul said show me a UH your works without your faith and I'll show you my work by my faith right so we supposed to have works but we never put our trust in our words we do them out of love I love the Lord so much I want to serve my brother I wanna serve my sister I want to serve my nephews and nieces our precious brothers sisters I do those because I love Jesus say man that's it I want to represent the King Jesus did it for us let's do it for each other amen and by serving each other we serve God a month absolutely it's that simple but long as he calls this witchcraft are you so foolish having begun in the spirit are ye now made perfect in the flesh receive the works law or by the hearing of faith he's you have you suffered so many things in vain and if it yet had been in vain he therefore the ministrant you into the spirit and worketh miracles among you do with him by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith everything is by faith you have faith in the word things will operate anything you need done that's within the confines of the Word of God if you have faith and speak it it'll take place amen we're teaching on that tonight notice in Galatians 4 8 how be it he says when you knew not God neither was servicing them by which by nature are no gods but now after they had known God or rather are known of God how turn you again to the weak and beggarly elements some of the lowest things God would see these as even though they're great things in the eyes of God as far as righteousness as far as justification has nothing to do with these works have nothing do with the salvation where until you're again the you desire again to be into bondage under a law I have to do this I had to do that and by doing this I'm going up and by doing this I'm making the rapture by doing this - no no it is by grace and faith of God that's it it is not Christ in what I can do it is not Christ and what I can remember it is not Christ and what I can imagine and that it's not Christ and it is Christ alone it is the blood and spirit of Jesus Christ and that and that alone is what we trust in daily hey man that's right there is nothing it is not Christ plus there is no Christ this and plus that and extra arrows like when they run a bill through the house or senate they always had these little things called earmarks or whatever then they did they have this perfect bill set up and they does this but then as it's going through this House or Senate they throw these little earmarks on it boom boom boom or writers they calm or whatever and then all these extra things go through and then once that bills passed then all these other ones are - I start I was supposed to go that's called being sneaky oh not well with Christ he said he wants to see himself he was the only righteous soul perfect one there was and he wants to see his life and his blood in you that's it amen now to continue on here now notice is also going in Galatians 4 21 tell me ye the desire to be under the law do you do ye not hear the law now notice only a prophet of God could break this down like this for Anna's written that Abraham had two sons one by a bondmaid the other by a freewoman he brings these two women these two sons and BRE said there Ashley types for he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh he says but the free woman was by promised that entire thing man I wish God would never allow to Abraham to have a Ishmael as this it was for a reason everything was ordained of God Abraham's false failures and slip-ups he listened to his wife he did this this does all it was ordained for God so it could be a type pieces which things are in allegories as he said but these are the two covenants the one from cyanide generates the Bonners and the other which is to Hagar Iman for Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and answereth to Jerusalem which is and is in bondage with her children look he said that man that man that wild man Ishmael was a man of law he said it'll produce that it'll produce that but Jerusalem which is free above is the mother of us all correct and in verse 29 he says what but as then he that is born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now right who is the greatest example of a wild man who lived to the tee by the law of st. Paul himself what did the law produce it for to produced a man so legalistic that when even the signs and wonders and miracles that they even the Pharisees and Sadducees even knew that no man could do these things but God and here are a hundred and twenty now doing the things of God that no one can do except God and this man even though he's a seed of God he is under the law he's so bound to the law he's married to it and when he's married to these things he sees someone another church another thing there and he does not agree with it though he knows he cannot dispute it he so he has to persecute it produced a wild man called saw but thank God he was a seed he had the gene seed within him and God allowed him to get that so even though in the natural eyes oh my goodness ain't saw under gamellia what a mighty man zio he says out of the stock of Benjamin pure as pure a thoroughbred in the eyes of man he was all that but in the eyes of God he was actually the lowest of all loads he was exactly what the Old Testament would produce death a perfect killing machine a religious killing machine which is a perfect killing machine because it looks righteous it looks like it's doing the right thing you did run well who did hinder they should not obey the truth this persuasion cometh out of him that calleth uses a little leaven leavens a man now in Matthew 16 as Christ is going to reveal the Mount of Transfiguration mystery as we know that that's going into adoption moving now he's going to be placed as the son his word will be the exact same as the father's what the Christ does what he says what he everything we'll count on him now he's the father is given full authority to the son he says what here he him but before that he must now pass a test okay he's going he's are been baptized already filled with the Holy Ghost already Dollard started doing the very worst of God and then now here in Matthew 16 verse 21 from that time Jesus from the time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples how that he must go unto Jerusalem he says and suffer many things the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and raised again he starts bringing forth a mystery he prophesied he's as boys he says I'm gonna have to die I'm going to the cross I'm going to suffer like the one he says you could not stop as I cannot stop this this is the very plan of God and then now notice in verse 22 then Peter took him and began to rebuke him saying far be it far from the lord this shall not be unto thee and notice a Christ now has is actually here in the test Christ is now going back to the Garden of Eden and he's in the exact same test that Eve was him because the serpent said thou shalt not surely die and notice how the Peter and we know the Satan was in Pier at this time just caught the revelation of who Christ was just moments earlier and notice how an unconverted person can be it could catch the very revelation the most intense revelation of God in one moment in the next moment completely be filled with Antichrist spirit he says and now Christ finds himself at the same test that Eve is in and now he must pass the test for his bride he couldn't leave Adam couldn't passage for man was born he says he said but when that purrs the temptation came to Eve Eve had to make a choice in the church fall so now Christ has a step in line for his bride and what now he's a challenge to me Satan in Christ calls it out he says I shall surely die Emma and the Bible says if you try to save your love uses you'll die he says but if you lose your life for Christ you'll live again amen absolutely he says what he said on the Peter get thee behind me Satan and from this point he identified the Antichrist spirit and he went on to be adopted the beautiful thing is the prophets in the church book he says he says end the temptation will come as follows he says it'll be just similar just like it wasn't evil remember Eve was already in the Garden of Eden Eve was already restored at that time at the time in this temptation saints of God we will be ready we don't have to be because remember the bride does not go into it she has learned she's been trained she's been led by the Holy Spirit the entire time a man and God now is anointing her to discern the Antichrist spirit come on in children because this move of the religious realm is going to be so nice the you were gonna have to fellowship we're going to be able to share the Prophet with the Catholic broom a will share the Prophet with the Methodists and Pentecostals the Assembly garden all the bestest and and the Presbyterians we're gonna share we all get to share our face together no we're not coming in as life-giving as that may sound that we all maybe become one we're not moving into it you know what the Prophet said about the first second miracle council he said they should have never went up into that beating they get an invitation don't even go we serve God and God alone amen that's right we're coming amen separate self and me be pure amen now notice here but notice at this time when Eve fell and then Adam Fowler says here in Genesis 3:7 and the eyes then breadth both were open the knew they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons right now notice how the scripture says that they chose the fig leaves the fig leaves come from fig trees and we know the fig tree represents Israel and we know that what the Israel was given the Old Testament the law at first which was a bloodless religion they met and they shown right here that that Jewish law that Jewish religion before Christ would not be eat enough am i absolutely that's exactly what that shows it is a bonus than they're trying to do it themselves give me something to do look the progress that they should have rejected it to contain Commandments and ask for something better amen and then of course we know in Genesis 4 3 says in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord notice another bloodless religion there's no holy spirit in this religion now moving in the spirit no filling none of that is just stay calm look how beautiful it is ah now now dealing with the examining yourself dealing with the Antichrist spirit in acts 8 9 once it examine some things here when you know how these people they kept in the New Testament he starts showing some things how people rise up and acts eight nine four there was a certain man called Simon which before time in the same city used sorcery and be wished the people of Samaria giving out that himself was some great one he specifically said he said there's something special about me I think I'm this and I think I that now watch what takes place here God is with me I'm a special man anointed that I he lifted himself up and he did a perfect sale he is a perfect salesman he sold it to the people and the people believed it and it was so they were so moved on this individual to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying this man is the great power this is the one any problems in this city we've got a guy we can go to this guy has great power of God and he told the people he was that one he lifted himself up and set the stage and everyone went in line hook and sinker these are things to watch for are they lifting up Christ or themselves is the meaning about them or Jesus Christ is the meaning about Jesus Christ and getting you healed and more lifted up and encouraging you all and this and that wasn't about them X 535 and he said to me men of Israel take heed yourself what you intend to do as touching these men he says bow before those days rose up Thaddeus boasting himself to be somebody well brother yes I go to Thailand and what do you do I've got a international ministry what do you do hmm well I'll let just you know shake my hand no no that's lifted up raw equal now God is no respecter of persons if I see someone on the street I'm talking about me if I see someone on the street and I don't and I don't feel some compassion about this homeless person God have mercy on me whether God tells us to do something for him or not maybe we should have some kind of a compassion we should and we were up late last night we're talking about dad and Jessie let's pray we had to just felt so much compassion we started praying for dad we're still believing we are servants from the pulpit on we are servants of God for people for lost humanity lost see the need salvation I love our sister acacia they're writing letters to my cousin this you know he never answers back G writes faithful God reward you for that you guys serve your mom and dad well everybody's doing their best for all the glory of God also notice what takes place you follow somebody you're gonna get slain to whomever the Bible says he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity he says that's in Revelations to whom a number of men about 400 joined themselves who was slain and all and as many as obeyed him he made disciples of himself we're scattered and brought to nought after this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing notice he was Judas which is of the tribe of Judah which means praise he was right in that line he says and rooms much away most people after himself he also perished in all even as many obeyed him were dispersed wash these things in John's 7:16 Jesus an through my doctrine is not mine but he that sent me If any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God or whether I speak of myself he says here the speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory when someone says that revelations 10 7 is not Malachi 4:5 they are changing they are taking away from the Word of God for their own glory they are saying the Prophet didn't have the revelation that I got I understand this is better than the prophet of God and you what they do they save their own tapes and listen their own tapes instead the prophets they send this pastors this pastors tape out and this pastors tape out from that certain thing listen that when we listen to the Prophet said he the speaketh of himself seeking his own glory but he that seeketh his his glory that sent him the same is true and no unrighteous is in him real quickly here in 2nd Thessalonians where a 55-minute Saints hold on just live longer he said let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God amen we know that's the Antichrist in 2nd Timothy 3:1 this know also that in the last days things of God was the first church age the last day potential was the second church age the last day potential they said all the way back there was the last date but saints of God we are the last of the last of the last of the last days right now it can't go any further there is no other Church changes there is a church there's a tribulation coming and then there's a great millennium coming Saints are done there is not an eighth Church age is not an eighth Church aging messenger there is none of that he's a bit broken last days perilous times first thing he identifies the first thing of these things to bring forth for men shall be lovers of their own cell know burr one covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient parents unthankful unholy without natural function wrote on to all these things ever learning never able to come to the knowledge of true see they never understand it we know in 1st Samuel 15 for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft witchcraft rebellion witchcraft rebellion against what the Word of God before against the revelation of the hour that's witchcraft he says and stubbornness god help us all I have examining ourselves daily hourly we want to be in this and stubbornness as iniquity and idolatry now look here Matthew 3 and we just got little ways here to go maybe 10 15 minutes that ok I want to show you something Lord brought to me at this when I was going to priest really came here in Matthew 3 verse 1 John the Baptist is now on the scene he starts preaching and what was this message repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand and he goes on now and 2 into uh I believe it some into Jerusalem around about Jordan there and were baptized of him in Jordan confessing their sins the true move of God is on the true move of God is started the true message is now on the scene but look but when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism he sent him Oh a generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come notice who showed up did they stay away in condemn it no they went to investigate they went to see what was going on at the very move of God and one thing I love here now if you go into if you ever if you ever that's the the the my sword or the II sword or whatever they've got many applications you can go and study the gill and bar and I went into Gil's on this and he says this being the first place in which mention is made of the Pharisees and Sadducees the first time the scripture right here it may not be a mist to give some account of them once for all and to begin with the Pharisees first with their name the word name Pharisee or frottage means to divide to make it a breach so they they are they divide themselves separate themselves from the people that is a religious and as Nikhil a tune is 'm they were called the visi the divided the Pharisees divided themselves some people as righteous persons notice they divided themselves righteously through religious through religion by their works you know why I love this I like going I like I love what the Prophet says I love all his quotes but I also like look what the Prophet said interchange book the preaching of the word now he's dealing with the man age he says the preaching the word was never greater as satan rose up as hordes of free thinkers and originators of Kanye's and rose up as liberal theologians spread their filthy where's God raised up mighty boys of faith and the greatest works of Christian literature and teaching and preaching came from this era not from Laodicea never has it's preachers and teachers been matched and never will they be what are we doing everything hey when I when I want to bring forth the server or study I just go ahead turn my computer on and I started studying what was sent to us the met I didn't bring this message I'm just now gathering information on a thought that God gave me or thing or I'm searching for what I gone to the message so looking at it I pull from the histories I pull from this I pull that I didn't do any of it I'm just collecting it putting in an order and then delivering a lot of times he's old he's old from the Mannings we're the ones that dig through all the histories dug it all out and sell it for us and then now I'm mourning the message has not in the message has actually compiled all these things put them on an app a Bible app for us a message and so we can pull from this and we've all the message the hour oh my goodness we have it all just all's we gotta do is each it regurgitate sure upped immediately met yeah he says the Spurgeon's the Parkers the McLaren's the Edwards the bunions he says he's the molars the brains of the bars the bishops and I would include the gills as well all came from this ere they preached and taught the Word of God they glorified his name I love it now as gills dealing with these Pharisees Pharisees when this sect first begun and who was the first author of it is not easy to say the owned the Pharisees they don't know who started it it is certain they were great numbers of them in the times of John the Baptist and of Christ and for some time after that he says history records the Pharisees athlet he says the Jews say that when the temple was destroyed the second time the Pharisees increased in Israel so notice the destruction of the house of God more religious come in more anti word come in but now where does Google bring forth in the histories did you know it is recorded in history there are seven kinds of Pharisees you can't make it up there's not five there's not six there's not a there's seven you wait till you see the seventh one the Tomek riders say there were seven sorts of them well he says and if it would not be too tedious to the reader it goes like he's he's like asking permission to write this so I can he said I just want to include this in for you guys I want to expand your minds and so you can actually identify the Antichrist spirit here the girl says I feel it he says if it's okay with you guys I'm gonna put this in my writings and rather because some of them seem to tally with the complexion and conduct of the Pharisees mentioned to the scriptures there were then the secchi might Pharisee they called him the such a might Pharisee who does as such um did is circumsized number such a went and got the the the daughter of was Edina Oh huh Genesis 34 verse 1 and Dina the daughter of Leia which she bear and the Jacob went out to see the daughters of the land and when such am the son of hey core the hivite the prince of the country saw her he took her and lay with her and defiled her and his sole claim under Dinah and the daughter of Jacob and he loved the damsel spake kindly unto her he fell in love with this religion a daughter or a church of the religion but a Pharisee is like a such a might Pharisee he did he did not get circumcised not on God's account did not get baptized let's say in the message hidden like a baptize because it was the will of God he was supposed to do it he felt a Pole to do it or for his own glory it was even for his glory that he got baptized or circumcised to say or because circumcision is a commandment of his but for his own profit and advantage and that he may get honour from men look I have come into the Israelite fold I've been circumcised just like they have and God gave me this wonderful wife come to the message looking for a precious sister you did it for his own advantage it was for him things that he could gain maybe I'll be a big minister in the messenger maybe I'll become the best deacon ever was and maybe I can get a position in the church such a might Pharisee the next one was called the dashing Pharisee who walks gently he was so religious the heel of one foot touching the great toe of the other he walked so gently as not to go to the right or to the left he wanted to have the perfect walk and he he kept his eyes on his walk and his walk alone walked so gentle among the people scarcely lift up his feet from the earth so that he dashes them against the stones and would be thereby thought to be in deep meditation this brother is amazing he just walks out alone and just finds things and ask God for things he's always seeking God and he's separate from the people but remember those things are good but a Pharisee is a divider and as the Prophet brought it forth he is a actor what they called it in Hollywood overacting well when I was in the world one of my favorite comedians was they called an over actor that's two number three Pharisee letting blood who makes as if his eye as he shuts his eyes that he may not look upon women and so runs and dashes his head against the wall to the blood gushes out as though a vein was opened brother I can't believe you look at that so trying to run away from evil and he does it on purpose trying to gain attention to show how a religious and how he loves the law how he wants to serve God by not defiling his eyes or his mind he runs into wall dashes his head's blubbering the wall bro down here brother leave me out of here I can't I don't want to look at anything just take me by the hand all acting and yet very very religious can you imagine that what if people in this message did that today it'd be obvious we're way past that now the depressed Pharisee who went Dumbledore bowed bowed down either because uh they called him the mortar Pharisee either because he wore a garment like a mortar with his mouth turned downwards or a hat resembling such a vest as well he could not look upward right this way or that way right forward he just always seemed to be just so burdened by the sins of the people and so Chuck I got almost like sighing and crying for the abominations done in the city this world is so bad oh god help us got it mercy but it was an act it was not even caring for the people it was for show and the prophets that Jesus Christ was not a showman he didn't show pradhan be yourself in Christ Jesus let Christ be you amen I was on my phone and I hit something and something popped up from Instagram and it was a pervert a thing and I don't know how they got on my phone I looked at it real quick it often done just move on yes it's automatic you don't want nothing to do with in you know I ain't gonna show tell nobody about another you just do it the de precios Pharisee number four number five the Pharisee the said what is my duty and I'll do it I will fulfill all of the law it's the military man the gloss upon this is teach me what is my duties and I'll do it be baptized it's already done study this message every day every hour every minute hello this is His Excellency if he were not an expert in the prohibitions and niceties of the commandments and comes to learn or thus what is more to be done and I have not done it the great rich young ruler I wonder Lord Lord how your great master great teacher I what must I do to enter the kingdom of heaven Lord said do the commandments I've I've done all these I've already done them from my youth up I've done them all Jesus he said oh if you want to be perfect then so all you got Christ always has a way to expose it oh you don't at all go give up everything I want do it all better make sure you're on the right spirit well let's preach the gospel what if we're not a preacher what if we're not what if we're not well lay hands on the sick and they shall recover what if you don't have the gift of healing absolutely he says he says so that he shows himself and would be being prepared appear that he had done and performed all my gosh that brother's done it he is to the T he's got his act together does he understood these things out to look for this is the Old Testament this is the New Testament shadow the Pharisee of fear number 6 who does what he does from fear of punishment well I don't want to go to hell and I don't want pastor Jesse to rebuke me I don't want to offend my brother and I don't want to offend my sister and listen that and just always real careful I mean okay what if I do this well this could happen well he does nothing well this past this brothers doing something but what if he gets mad at me and I say this or I see this sister doing something by me and I know it's wrong but I shouldn't what if I shouldn't you know why but there's actually a Pharisee a religious order and there were people within that or November this is there's seven kinds and each of all those Pharisees fit in one or two of these groups in other words that sphere that was on one affected the other groups and the spirit or Dawn affected others to be just like him and it's all done of the guise of religion what could be Saints God if you could guess what would be the seventh characteristic of a Pharisee or the seventh group which say label is number seven lines right up with the church ages the church age book the message the hour the Pharisee of love so I could choose kiss who does what he does from love but you know what because I love her I'm forced to love her I'm gonna get a great reward for this I really can't stand her but I must love her because the Bible says so is that real love I've done some tests on this section which the gloss explains thus for the love of the reward of the commandment all the commandments that Christ gave us to fulfill they do them because they want the heavenly reward more than actually doing it for the right reason and not for the love of the commandment of his creator one time I was at a service and as pastor was preaching on how big his crown was gonna be and it's gonna be this big and this big uns can have this and that and I'm like why is he worried about the reward instead of the people though they say all these there is a and Harry here's how the saying went though they say of all these there is none more none to be below but the spare sea of love oh there's neva love Pharisees the Pharisee of love is the best one you know how I test this lately I've actually took in fact in before I found this I did little tests and I'll encounter a minister or a brother of this net and I'd say oh brother bla bla and they start talking about themselves and giving me their testimonies and I listen to them all wonderful praise God praise God and then when they're done I start telling me telling them my testimonies and oh oh oh brother Sam right well I gotta go hmm okay thanks of God I'm not imagining things I'm testing things oh you really love me how come I have to hear your testimony but you want to hear mine you don't think I have testimonies you got testimonies I know you got Testaments you got testimonies you all we all have testimony Saints God is a living God he works in all of our lives we all have healing testimonies and revelations come to us we've all been I believe we've all been filled with the Holy Ghost we all have testimonies God's leading the Bible said when the Holy Ghost comes you only lead the fivefold ministry no I don't say that you will need and gave those for the Holy Ghost in spirit and in truth they meant anyone the scalp the Holy Ghost spirit he will lead and guide them and he who performing his works through them either believe in the baptized these Shia signs shall follow them there but then them that believe this the he that believeth baptized the fire fold the believer 7:02 them that belief anyone that believes this word signs and wonders miracles will follow your life like that song on the way to church today miracles miracles everywhere that we go miracles I know I did sound good but it's the truth anyhow the Pharisee of love number seven right up with what divine love number seven on the capstone amazing how that just lines up in it sometime we we can't glean from these old these old uh old man age guys man they they know what they're talking about the church the broadband said the foreign Pharisee means actor the very word Pharisee means an actor an actor is a mimic or impersonator and how well that does fit in our modern word of hypocrite and actor and in person if somebody who's trying to be something as Congress Upshaw said he's he said you can't be nobody you hain't he says that's southern be yourself amen he said but a Pharisee oh I hate that word he says I'm gonna some sisters do now look he says some sisters do the same thing a Pharisee wife oh they'll cut their husbands and nose off with John why did he do that Amen why is you know maybe this network someone's someone's a wife saying Simon why do you you made the worse this year's why Simon Oh huh Hugo she'll go off on her husband and then the Prophet says oh my god delivered me from every calling on that kind of spirit easy he says but let you talk on the telephone oh how do you do he says I'm so glad you called he says actors Pharisee wife actors shame on you how singles Road Devils putting on see wives and sisters how reverent we must become to the men the husbands treat each other with honor to the aged men as father's to the aged women as mothers and brothers and sisters all around just be yourself at all time that's the best way to be don't you better leave it I know this is kind of sobering message and as a tea I'm a teacher this is why I just tea I can't just teach okay said that why I've snapped at their husbands now we're getting here looking lips let me jump here real quick revelations five sub 15 stand if you want well staying here we'll go into closing everybody God's grace revelations 3:15 he says I know thy works that thou art neither a hot or cold I would add our cold or hot go back to revelations right now notice what he says here in the sermon the pure the Philadelphian church age sermon in nineteen sixty twelve ten so it was with the early church of that Galatians Paul dealing with Galatians B which what that your works have something to a salvation so it was with the early church notice at the end at the end of the Laodicean age went back to works again so one of the things we're going to see at this end time the end of the end is people exalting their own works instead of God I've done this and I've done that I'm not talking about denomination I'm talking in the message note if you notice here to show that his church is between these two he says if you go into Laodicean Church age or the thylacine church age I know there were right at the end of the alien age what was it thy works that works and the seat were sayings at what was the seat of Satan C went right straight back into denominations again when you think your work she says that's a dude that's a denominational spirit right back into nomination saying I did this the Pentecost say up to this a million more in 44 I did this this is this look at we have done there all Lord Lord have we not done many wonderful mighty works in thy name same service the fill a church the end of Leila seems they went back to works again or Pentecostal denominations went back to the denomination what do these didn't mess what are these preachers in the message when this temptation come and they go in they go right back because they think it's their works you don't think there's something's going to go back the Prophet said there's some many ministers you can go back and be tempted to some will stays and will go or to God now I want to read this last quote here if he's in church age church age book John knew them knew of them he sent John first John many false prophets will rise the Antichrist was already infiltrating the church and it was doing it by going against the word okay going against the word the Anti Christ Church the Antichrist spirit is now in a church what is the Antichrist spirit Satan himself demons minions the most distorted creatures evil full of Filth creatures on the face and then the under the earth above the earth well these things are they're the worst things there is that kind of spirit gets into the church right now what is the spirit going to do what is how does that spirit disguise itself why here is where it all started right here at the first church age already they were denying the word notice he's going back to the beginning here what we read in the New Testament setting their their own Creed's and philosophies instead of the word that is Antichrist for Jesus is the word to be Antichrist is to be anti Jesus right he says to be Antichrist anti words me Antichrist because the spirit and the word are one if you're Antichrist you will be Antichrist or sorry if you're anti word you'll be Antichrist and if it started in the first church in and it would have to grow so whatever that little spirit was that when in the church will have to grow so it's gonna be a big spirit a big ugly thing yes now are we talking about the Catholic Church no it will have to go into the end when it takes over and that is exactly what you'll see as we cover all the ages it started out so real small and the fees ensured it grows into every age until anti word Antichrist em takes over entirely infallible availability of the word is repudiated by the false apostles and false church now prophet went on wrong he said man this is going to grow and grow and get bigger bigger now it could be easy to get the wrong impression he says what I just said here he's about growing and get worse snores he says he said this you could get the wrong impression on this he says is that what we're talking about he's I'm gonna make this so strong it could sound to you as though this anti word Antichrist spirit is a complete reputation reputation repeat reputation of the word in other words fully going away from the Bible fully going away from religion it does not grow into that a denial the Bible a culminating in its rejection rejection no no sir it is not that it is the changing of even just one word by taking away or adding to it that my brothers and my sisters are this is the Antichrist spirit that is the greatest actor there is what if I was an actor and I would say this to a Christian actor what would be the greatest part you could play part of Jesus to walk like Christ to talk like Christ to act like Christ in Thailand they they always say like this house bring it god bless you sister god bless you better to act exactly like Christ Himself knowing the word just like in the garden knowing how to bring just like Balaam how I bring God down perfect for show the entrance to worship knowing everything but to venture to add or take away one word this is a serious time Saints ah this is pressing more and more on my heart every day I didn't even look for this stuff this stuff just shows up to me I catch it I'm rereading the church age book and getting it through and getting through it and it's these things these cultures is popping up to me I'm thinking these things are absolutely marvelous in Ephesus it was just the same just a word added a word taken away the anti word Antichrist spirit began to flourish examine yourselves make sure we're not acting I don't believe anyone here as an actor but we want to be clean every hour every minute just exist brother Simon why did I do that beside why did you do this why'd he do that God forgive me help me there how many do this how we do that one time just recently I was on a job site and the superintendent walked out to me said all you work for Chuck and listen as he goes he was uh-uh are you his son and I said no and I kind of made a funny remark you know kinda like that'd be a bad thing you know instantly I felt checked I want the site I'm like I got to make that right so next time I was on the job I said hey mr. servers oh you know when you said that this is a said I was just joking I'm sorry about that Chuck is what Chuck is the best employer I've ever had he is the very best boss I've ever had but just to make a little negative comment it was just a joke even but it was negative that grieved me so bad you know with the spirit of America's rough that joking and the flower frolicking and and just you know we just got a bright the good thing is I felt a check and I thank God for that and the good thing is I had opportunity to make it right and I looked up to this man he's not a Christian and I said man I apologize for that I know this this isn't everything so I had a chance an opportunity to make that right so saints of God were in a serious hour and tonight we're going to teach on others a different subject but along the same lines by God's grace and if you need prayer come on up we're believing we need anything from God come on up anything you need we'll pray for by God's grace we all believe we're gonna make it what if I could tell you you're not gonna make it you would say brother Simon I gonna forgive you for that but I am that one that the Prophet was speaking of when I'm gonna make this rapture there is nothing gonna stand in my way I'm not going to compromise I'm not gonna let down the bars I'm not gonna do these things I am going to make this rapture because I believe that I am ordained of God I believe I'm chosen of God I believe that I am that one and I don't only believe that I am that one but I believe the entire church here by the grace of God is gonna make this rapture we are drawing a circle the entire bride of Jesus Christ make this rapture your loved ones at home and don't come to church they're gonna make it why because we're speaking it saints of God we must man if sister had ear I can speak salvation into her to revenge said they were what rascal boys a rickety boys or something that we can speak the same thing I am believing for my entire family brother Jesse we are believing we are we touching agree we've done it many times we always say they are coming I will not rest and know the rapture to have to take place and then not be there for me to believe it I'll say like that but I believe they're gonna make it you know why because God saved a sinner like this guy this low down easy cheat cheating stealing

still a seed Nicodemus a secret believer Lord he showed his colors their Lord at her at the death of Christ he came and got the very body Lord of Christ he he showed who he was at that time at the very death he exposed that he was a believer Jesus Christ and that word was more precious to him he embalmed it and laid it right to rest Norden was so precious to him God although we may see brothers or sisters that may we may even think are Pharisees Lord or Sadducees Lord though we're gonna love him right in the kingdom God told me we never ever get an antichrist spirit on us Lord but we wanted we don't want to ask God but we pray Lord that you would live through us Lord as we yield our bodies and vessels every day Lord live your life through us we don't want no acting here down Lord Lord
