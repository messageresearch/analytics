[30:44] Revelation chapter 3 verse 1 like to
[30:46] begin the starlit Sardis church into
[30:48] that region Church partner
[30:51] so our ancient church age we look at
[30:52] that tonight about the grace of the Lord
[30:54] I think you'll be blessed I really enjoy
[30:56] preparing this morning over be a
[30:59] blessing Revelation chapter 3 verse 1 I
[31:11] believe it six verses it's a little bit
[31:13] of shorter to church age far as the
[31:15] number of verses they set the timer here
[31:25] after tonight that grace of more just so
[31:29] you're aware I don't know if you noticed
[31:32] earlier but we had things a little
[31:33] different Wednesdays and next Thursday
[31:36] on the midweek we're trying to do all
[31:39] you little youth group the children be
[31:40] able to order now and Sunday mornings
[31:43] it's a hard for everybody to get here so
[31:45] we're just gonna try to be a little
[31:46] youth group like a little Bible study
[31:48] for the kids 5:30 to 6:30 on Wednesdays
[31:51] but next week we Thursday so if you come
[31:54] here though early and we're in here
[31:55] that's probably what's going on by the
[31:56] grace but John I had never talked it we
[31:59] thought that might be a good thing to
[32:01] get the young younger people okay
[32:03] growing up turn into teenagers minister
[32:07] directly to them so we got a good time
[32:08] today in the Lord enjoyed that by the
[32:10] grace of Lord so Revelation chapter 3
[32:13] it's the first one let's just read verse
[32:21] one together because we're not going to
[32:23] really get as far as I have been planned
[32:24] to get to any other verses just the
[32:26] beginning the first one revelation 3
[32:29] verse 1 let's begin on three one two
[32:31] three and under they
[32:33] the church in Sardis write these things
[32:36] saith he that hath the seven spirits of
[32:39] God and the Seven Stars I know that it
[32:42] works that now has a pain that now
[32:44] within us
[32:47] let's go for Lord another word of Prayer
[32:49] you know your heart just maybe even if
[32:51] you got heavenly father we love you
[32:54] tonight Lord we are your chosen sea
[32:56] though we believe that with all of our
[32:57] hearts Lord I believe what all of us can
[33:00] say we need not go looking for you or
[33:02] you came looking for us yes there was a
[33:05] little hunger in our hearts to find you
[33:06] but the Bible says really no man who
[33:08] seeks God it is God who seeks after and
[33:12] it is God who leaves the 99 to go get
[33:14] the one dear God thank you for coming to
[33:17] get me thank you lord
[33:18] each of us could say that thank you for
[33:20] coming to find us to choose us and bring
[33:23] us back to the fold that we might bring
[33:25] forth fruit in this season of our lives
[33:27] more we're grateful Lord
[33:29] I think the jose starting another year
[33:31] Lord of his life and my daughter Lauren
[33:33] at each of us Lord God you have all we
[33:36] have Lord for the kingdom of God then
[33:37] it's increase our love increase our
[33:40] worship and dedication Lord God let us
[33:42] give all we have for you are so great
[33:44] and gracious to us Lord you rescued us
[33:47] you went and found us that's O Lord we
[33:50] want to give you all of our lives yeah
[33:52] help us to be a hundredfold as we heard
[33:55] Lord from the scripture be with us and I
[33:58] administered every need Lord God even
[33:59] and these are those services where we're
[34:01] teaching on Church ages
[34:03] true they can mean everything Lord God
[34:05] we're mindful of that we're aware of
[34:06] that I listen to our heart and have
[34:08] faith and pour on the Word of God in
[34:11] Jesus Christ's name sir said mrs. Benson
[34:15] praise the Lord
[34:18] now if I'm ready I have some I have all
[34:21] the quotes I believe I'd like to mention
[34:23] tonight ready to go this week I just
[34:29] finished Revelation chapter 1 so I don't
[34:31] know I got a like from a demonic patient
[34:33] on Facebook sent somebody else gave me
[34:35] like so I appreciate that so if you I'm
[34:38] going to do a review of every chapter
[34:39] the book of Revelation so I've already
[34:43] got some good feedback on the Surrency
[34:45] one brother from
[34:46] salvadore emailed me and said Oh Jessie
[34:50] our pastor was in like a little debate
[34:53] it was another pastor did believe
[34:54] Surrency and he said when you posted
[34:56] your sermon see video it was just what
[34:58] he needed to go meet this gentleman in
[35:00] debates I don't know if I don't know if
[35:02] he convinced to get rich or not but he
[35:04] just said it was very timely so I thank
[35:06] the Lord that it was time I just want to
[35:08] be right on time I know he's always on
[35:10] time
[35:10] even when I'm late he's on time Adam I
[35:12] just cruciate that testimony somebody
[35:15] overseas said you know thank god you're
[35:17] anointed for this hour at each door
[35:19] praise the Lord what else could I do
[35:21] what else what else what I want to do
[35:23] other than stay in God's Word it's all
[35:25] very thankful for that let's do this
[35:27] tonight
[35:27] July 19th here very thankful for another
[35:29] opportunity to be in the house of Lord
[35:31] we just did verse 1 we're not going to
[35:32] get down there
[35:33] probably not the grace of the Lord so I
[35:40] like to start with the summary Graham
[35:42] just gives a brief summary so it's on
[35:45] the Ephesian Church age he said the
[35:47] Church of Sardis was the Reformation in
[35:49] so just keep down your minds the age of
[35:51] the Protestant Reformation he said now
[35:54] you corrects himself he started saying
[35:55] great missionary that was actually the
[35:57] Philadelphia Church he said or not he
[35:59] said but the hidden names they had their
[36:02] own names this was an age of Reformation
[36:04] but notice it wasn't restoration but
[36:08] Reformation right not not restoration
[36:11] everything wasn't restored that's our
[36:12] day aren't you mad living that day I'm
[36:14] glad to live in this day I'm glad to
[36:16] live in a day a full restoration of the
[36:18] Word of God but they just had some
[36:22] reforms some things were changed major
[36:25] things like idolatry of course was
[36:26] changed look at that tonight some of
[36:29] those things but this is how program
[36:32] summarizes Reformation and they had
[36:35] their own name so a lot of the church
[36:37] age people started following different
[36:39] ones like John Calvin Martin Luther and
[36:42] they said I'm a loser I'm a Calvinist so
[36:45] that was part of the mistake this is a
[36:47] age where they didn't have a full word
[36:48] so they still followed men they still
[36:51] denominator around men after a while the
[36:55] church age did so but they had some
[36:57] pretty off pretty amazing rewards white
[36:59] raiment which
[37:00] the righteousness of Jesus crisis its
[37:02] eternal life it's the clothing of
[37:04] eternal life
[37:06] the name of the book which we know a
[37:08] huge portion of the church age book is
[37:10] on the book of life I think it's like 20
[37:12] 21 pages I think it's the most doctrine
[37:14] is the doctrine that has the most pages
[37:16] in all the church age book is the book
[37:17] of life and then yeah okay then they
[37:21] said okay now he talks about the book of
[37:23] life down the fifth church age Sardis
[37:25] went from 1520 to 1750 eighty-two
[37:29] messenger Luther and you live from 1483
[37:32] to 1546 there's your star close up then
[37:37] there's your your circle of light
[37:39] they're very little light and there's
[37:43] the full picture from the church age
[37:46] book of the search ages so I'm pretty
[37:47] happy now I've already pre-selling to
[37:49] see it and now I'm on the fifth one so I
[37:51] only got two more to go really I'll
[37:53] probably to preach a brief review sermon
[37:55] of that once and try to bring into today
[37:57] again to look at those things we
[37:59] preached throughout later see in 2015
[38:01] these are 2017 so we got Sardis and
[38:04] Philadelphia hopefully we'll finish it
[38:06] in 2017
[38:07] unless we can let that go some other
[38:09] direction so this is just the overview I
[38:11] have ten years run alone here so if you
[38:13] ever see something wrong please correct
[38:14] me but I had these years wrongs had to
[38:17] fix that here and easier so this age was
[38:19] not even 250 years so it's around a
[38:23] short shorter age compared to the fire
[38:25] to your church age now show this one
[38:27] last week I just worked on this one you
[38:30] have all the church ages down here all
[38:31] the names all the messengers how long
[38:34] the church age lasted but here's what I
[38:35] added I added all the major attacks of
[38:38] Satan
[38:39] so sake will first get you to do deeds
[38:41] without a doctrine right and then he'll
[38:43] get the church to become a synagogue of
[38:45] Satan and then they'll have their own
[38:47] false doctrines and then the spirit of
[38:49] Jezebel comes in there which is a false
[38:52] prophetess seducing sphere a woman
[38:54] dominating woman spirit lead the church
[38:57] and then it brought a dame than living a
[39:00] name with dead they had a Danish but not
[39:02] the life of Christ the full life yet the
[39:05] synagogue of Satan in Philadelphia and
[39:07] it ends with people that go to church
[39:09] but Christ is outside the church
[39:12] right so that state is greatest
[39:14] deception to get people in a house of
[39:17] what they think is salvation but they
[39:19] themselves don't know salvation they're
[39:21] not saved and the annoying things last
[39:24] about this love the way the only thing
[39:25] sorry my deleting laughs it's about here
[39:29] because this is where rom 3:12 this is
[39:33] where Satan gets power of church and
[39:36] state and he can start killing people
[39:37] you know the Pope's can kill people
[39:39] because they control the state
[39:40] government and that lasts until right
[39:44] around here where they start the
[39:45] indulgences is pretty heavy that's the
[39:46] kind of church capturing the wealth of
[39:48] the world did they still kill yes they
[39:51] still kill but the focus was off of the
[39:53] killing and now more on the money
[39:55] naturally in the wealth of the world
[39:56] because you have scale balances you know
[39:58] and then of course all three of these
[40:01] spirits evil spirits white red black
[40:03] combined into the pale horse rider but
[40:06] all God's holiness combines into us amen
[40:09] the flying ego praise the Lord now the
[40:13] city of Sardis was the fifth city here
[40:16] in modern-day Turkey
[40:17] now we've spent a little bit of time on
[40:19] Sardis just sort of a type because some
[40:21] of these things aren't interesting there
[40:23] was a capital of ancient Lydia it passed
[40:26] from the hands of Lydia and monarchs to
[40:28] the Persians and that's the allocator
[40:30] the great so you know we know those
[40:32] Babylon meets a Persians Greeks so this
[40:34] was controlled by the means of Persians
[40:37] and the Greeks the kings of Pergamos
[40:40] then succeeded to the Dominion until the
[40:42] Romans took over cleave in Rome in the
[40:45] type of Tiberius was decimated by
[40:47] earthquakes and plagues today it's a
[40:49] heap of ruins and other than habited the
[40:51] city was at one time very important
[40:53] commercially I skip that whole paragraph
[40:55] because it didn't really relate to the
[40:56] things that I felt led to preach tonight
[40:58] I want to look at the religion of Sardis
[41:01] this is really interesting I think
[41:04] you'll I think you can understand it a
[41:06] little better if I go through this a
[41:08] little slower
[41:08] the religion of this city was the impure
[41:11] worship of the goddess side Elms just a
[41:13] side note
[41:14] Cybele because I don't know how to say
[41:16] I'll say stop felt like oh who's it the
[41:18] massive ruins of the temple may still be
[41:20] seen you'll recall that the pergamene
[41:22] age I mentioned that the Babylonians
[41:25] concept of mother and son
[41:26] known as semi radius and nightís became
[41:30] the Sai belly and do iose of Asia the
[41:35] attributes attached to these two are
[41:36] most enlightening as we view them side
[41:38] by side so you say let's put these two
[41:40] mother Sun worship patterns let's put
[41:42] them side-by-side
[41:43] I noticed he the man or the sudden was
[41:49] the son of God was the Sun God
[41:51] she was the moon goddess he was lord of
[41:55] heaven she was the queen of heaven the
[41:59] son was the revealer of goodness and
[42:00] true she was of gentleness and mercy he
[42:03] was the mediator she was the mediators
[42:05] now how about those because those are
[42:06] exact words the Roman Catholic Church
[42:09] uses for Mary how many understand that
[42:11] is it's the exact word she's called the
[42:13] Queen of Heaven she's called the mother
[42:16] of God even and the Bible says God has
[42:19] no mother right let's see they don't
[42:21] have a revelation of message so they
[42:22] can't understand that but we did amen
[42:25] thank God for the message he was the key
[42:28] that opens and shuts the gates of the
[42:29] miserable world that's actually Jesus
[42:31] stole that from Jesus and she was
[42:33] identical keep doing likewise he has the
[42:37] judge of the Dead she is standing on the
[42:38] side he being killed race and ascended
[42:40] into heaven
[42:41] she'd been carried their bodily by the
[42:42] Sun now those are the those are the
[42:46] things they have in common
[42:48] those two mother son worships they have
[42:50] those in common and they all have them
[42:52] in common with the Roman Catholic Church
[42:53] now in role this same God is given the
[42:58] title of our Lord he's called the Son of
[43:00] God why he's while she has called the
[43:02] mother of God so the words all the Roman
[43:05] Catholic Church did was take those same
[43:07] attributes and apply them to Jesus and
[43:10] Mary okay but would Jesus and Mary good
[43:14] of course no one was good to Jesus right
[43:15] he's the one that was really good so
[43:18] they take true characters of the Bible
[43:21] Mary Jesus but then they give them pagan
[43:25] identifications right so they put pagan
[43:27] definitions on true characters godly
[43:30] people of course and Jesus is not in
[43:32] flesh now and that is what we find back
[43:36] in our the other two ages where the
[43:38] mother and son concept
[43:39] on such tremendous proportions but now I
[43:42] notice that even as it was back in
[43:43] Babylon that the worship of the Suffolk
[43:46] and to lose out in favor of the worship
[43:48] of the mother so she literally began to
[43:50] take the place of the son
[43:52] oh mercy they started out worshiping the
[43:56] Sun you see that but slowly over time
[43:58] Satan wasn't content but he slowly
[44:01] changed it to where the woman gets
[44:03] worship that's why you and I have to be
[44:06] able to see now it's our lives falling
[44:08] away from anything slowly we have to be
[44:11] a look at our lives and see as my life
[44:13] changed for the better the worst in the
[44:14] last six months there it's my life in
[44:16] the last year am i closer to Christ or
[44:19] more in love with Christ in the last
[44:20] year we have to be able to see that
[44:22] because these people could not see the
[44:24] slow gradual move and just as the
[44:27] pastor's deceive ever slowly that they
[44:31] just went right along with it
[44:32] we can't have that we must let no man
[44:35] deceive us I hoped I would never use me
[44:38] to deceive but if I would say something
[44:40] wrong don't let me know believe it right
[44:43] no matter who does the prank comes in
[44:45] here or sign thinner you know man end of
[44:47] in we're going to make mistakes but our
[44:49] your hearts we say the right thing
[44:50] believe it with all your heart but if
[44:53] there's anything that's wrong then don't
[44:54] accept that pray and bring it before of
[44:57] us because we all want to be right I
[44:59] want to be right I've got to stand
[45:01] before God to answer for this church and
[45:03] I want to say everything I've preached
[45:04] that I knew was the right thing don't
[45:06] you husband's want to answer for your
[45:08] families and your wives and say Lord I
[45:10] let my wife as faithful as I could
[45:12] notice when I do that oh my how I want
[45:14] to do that but see over time it was tied
[45:18] tied deceived them so we have to see our
[45:21] lives becoming more like Christ in time
[45:25] we see in this age of the pagan worship
[45:28] of Sardis was the worship of the woman
[45:31] so we have that even increased today it
[45:34] is cybela alone that side belly and do a
[45:37] house the mother has literally taken the
[45:40] place of the Sun and down with the
[45:42] merits of the Godhead because now she's
[45:44] the mother of God she's abode continent
[45:46] all we need to do is go over her various
[45:49] titles to recall that lovely attributes
[45:52] accorded marry by the Roman Catholic to
[45:54] understand where the religionists age
[45:55] came from now can I take a break and I
[45:58] show you about a little video real quick
[45:59] on Mystery Babylon has everybody watched
[46:01] it yeah my children wants to be good
[46:05] much my children have him okay I want to
[46:07] show it then by God's grace I didn't
[46:08] know if I had no watch it but I want to
[46:11] I want to show it again on the grace of
[46:13] God I think it's good for all of us to
[46:14] see them sorry okay I want you to see
[46:29] these titles again 65 verse 2 says shall
[46:55] all flesh cup the CCC specifically
[46:59] teaches okay so see this is the number
[47:10] you can the book is all by paragraphs
[47:13] you can go right in that book and
[47:14] there's the paragraph that said that
[47:16] saying pray to Mary to have her talk to
[47:20] the son for us she no nothing like that
[47:23] Jerry spit but this is as they make a
[47:25] name to see over almost 2 million people
[47:28] or the Roman Catholic Church and they're
[47:30] deceived because they don't even read
[47:31] the Word of God right now see that's
[47:35] that's why we're thankful doesn't that
[47:38] make you thankful that you are not
[47:39] worshiping a woman goddess tonight but
[47:41] that make you think oh my goodness my
[47:43] parents and I'm sorry I might get my
[47:45] parents used to go to County church my
[47:47] brothers were baptized and sprinkling as
[47:49] a babies in the Catholic Church
[47:50] I'm so glad God had called us out of
[47:53] there I think I caught us a Pentecostal
[47:55] church because it had less abominations
[47:58] yes it had cutting hair and makeup and
[48:00] they cross-dressing and abominations
[48:02] like that but they got it was it to this
[48:05] level because this is
[48:06] the mother of abominations she has the
[48:08] most of hominins now let's go a little
[48:10] bit a little bit more here on Mary
[48:13] Jewish protection that fateful fly they
[48:17] may fly to the mother of God
[48:19] what the Bible teaches that Jesus alone
[48:21] is able to save us with his intercession
[48:24] Hebrews 7:25 wherefore he is able also
[48:28] to save them to the uttermost that come
[48:30] unto God by seeing he ever liveth to
[48:33] make intercession for them the worship
[48:38] of the Virgin Mary
[48:39] the CCC truly defines Mary the mother of
[48:43] Jesus which is another form of idolatry
[48:45] the CCC states that Mary is the building
[48:50] and it was preserved free from all stain
[48:53] an original City everybody see how
[48:55] that's to lie down treat all holy one
[48:59] that's only Jesus it can be nobody else
[49:01] but they they put taking these pagan
[49:04] goddesses and given all their ideas
[49:07] about the pagan goddess isn't applied to
[49:08] Mary Mary's not the problem they're the
[49:11] problem right the demons that are 1902
[49:14] do this they're the problem right and
[49:17] then free from all stain of original sin
[49:20] I mean she she never had to send her
[49:22] members when there's no scripture for
[49:23] that because all have sinned and fallen
[49:26] short of the glory of God amen this is
[49:29] my enemy so it's so important static at
[49:31] the church they have the steam on
[49:33] experience of women worship in their
[49:37] church that's why we harm that's why I
[49:39] mean rarely go in there let's we have to
[49:40] do for a wedding right that's over
[49:41] another week we just go behind their
[49:43] guests that place is full of unclean
[49:45] spirits Jesus
[50:12] the CCC exam area our God for she's a
[50:17] tight
[50:18] Oh God and Queen over all things
[50:21] she was also said to have a saving
[50:23] office and programmatic or intercession
[50:27] continues to bring us the gifts of
[50:29] eternal salvation she's to be incorrect
[50:32] under the titles of an advocate for
[50:34] benefactors and mediators God is the
[50:38] only Savior there is no scripture for
[50:40] Mary saving anyone at any time or any
[50:43] place I'm gonna stop right okay my God's
[50:45] grace I'm not I just want you to hear
[50:47] that a fresh all holy one mother of God
[50:50] mediator
[50:51] she's invoked that's nothing but a
[50:53] straight-leg you listen it's not against
[50:55] the individuals writers we love
[50:56] individuals it's against the system and
[50:59] the demons behind that system I want you
[51:01] to see that again this is what people
[51:04] and they call themselves Christians
[51:05] right and they're sweet people aren't
[51:08] they there's they're wonderful people
[51:09] they're against abortion I've been there
[51:11] gets murdered praise God they got for
[51:13] that most of our against homosexuality
[51:16] right there sweet people but they're
[51:18] very deceived so if our eyes are open
[51:21] and say let me should pray God use us as
[51:23] a light the witness amen
[51:25] like I said across the couch for my mom
[51:26] - Sarah's gonna said mom don't you ever
[51:28] go into that room we count the church
[51:31] she's the one that's gonna write the
[51:33] Beast I said mine was your is your
[51:35] denomination with the Word of God and
[51:37] she said she eventually said this my
[51:39] denomination is following away from the
[51:41] Holy Spirit I thought my church let's
[51:45] look at our church now is our church
[51:46] following the way for the Holy Spirit
[51:48] are we being obedient to the Holy Spirit
[51:49] for what I've seen about what we're
[51:51] preaching a living we're obeying the
[51:53] Holy Spirit praise God if not somebody
[51:56] come to tell me about it I need to know
[51:57] praise the Lord see we're following the
[52:00] leadership of the Holy Spirit we need to
[52:02] be more consecrated yes we certainly did
[52:04] we certainly do
[52:05] but God would help us do that because
[52:07] that takes it death to self now just say
[52:10] no so listen this is they're they're
[52:11] giving us a up they're getting us a
[52:13] chart here mother son worship in Babylon
[52:17] was the semi rammus tinnitus in agent
[52:20] with Cybele Ian and di offices which is
[52:22] Sarris now but Ramsey says this two
[52:25] things really struck me with force as I
[52:27] looked into this worship upside Valley
[52:29] one was the fact that she worked
[52:31] like janus which gave her the same
[52:33] authority as Janus Keita had a nerve
[52:36] from the mysteries and the fact that the
[52:37] worst FERS whip themselves up to blood
[52:39] spurt spurts from their bodies which
[52:43] thing is done right today by the
[52:44] Catholics who feel that are suffering
[52:46] like the Lord I've ever seen that where
[52:47] the Catholics hurt themselves
[52:49] I was listening to brother Craig give
[52:51] his missionary report from the
[52:52] Philippines and he said he was there
[52:54] over Easter and he watched Catholics go
[52:57] down the street and whip themselves
[52:58] carry crosses and their bloody and
[53:00] they're going all down the street
[53:02] they're trying to partake of the
[53:05] sufferings of Christ the wrong way
[53:07] what is this where's they want to do
[53:09] it's another form of male worship where
[53:11] the male worshipers cut themselves God
[53:13] doesn't want us to cut ourselves God
[53:15] wants us suffers are hearty not our
[53:18] bodies that wants to cut off the
[53:20] circumcision of the flesh David head the
[53:22] excess flesh of the heart that's what
[53:24] God would say then a hard guy would be
[53:26] able to be cut it and form and shape and
[53:29] make more like enemy men but see they
[53:32] take it natural when Jesus said it me
[53:35] needs to be done spiritual sees that
[53:39] same female experiment that woman
[53:41] worship and that Sun worship that gets
[53:43] in the people to cut themselves and hurt
[53:44] themselves and make them suffer like
[53:47] that the fact that this is the age of
[53:50] the first real break with power ohms you
[53:52] know that sorry this is the first real
[53:54] break from papal Rome the other ones
[53:56] were going to mix he said it that
[53:58] actually flourished this is the first
[54:01] break that flourished because Martin
[54:02] Luther's work flourished Lord no doubt
[54:06] caused the Jezebel prophetess to
[54:08] consolidate and emphasize her doctrine
[54:10] of Mary Allah tree in the sighted
[54:13] opposition to the Protestants who denied
[54:15] her any part whatsoever the plan of
[54:17] salvation apart from her favor with God
[54:19] as the virgin chose to bear the babe as
[54:22] Luther crystallized the doctrine of
[54:24] justification by faith they held to work
[54:26] spent prayers and other unscriptural
[54:29] meetings so this is the first age where
[54:31] the Christians really broke free from
[54:33] the papal system and because of that
[54:36] she's I'm okay then let's let's make our
[54:38] empire stronger than ever
[54:39] we got all those people out let's make
[54:41] it stronger let's go full bar with bear
[54:44] that's what they did that's the free
[54:47] Christians glorified the Sun that's what
[54:49] we did right you are my Christ the Roman
[54:52] Catholics increase their deification of
[54:54] Mary until the 20th century saw in
[54:57] opposition to the most high rate
[54:59] enrollment theologians Pope Pius
[55:02] literally exalt Mary's a glorification
[55:04] resurrected but this happened during
[55:06] brother Graham's life it was 1952 look
[55:08] it up
[55:08] it's called the Assumption of Mary Pope
[55:11] Pius Day the new assumption he made a
[55:13] new doctrine that Mary never died she
[55:16] was raptured that's basically what they
[55:18] mean look it up you could leave nothing
[55:20] look it up on Wikipedia the Britannica
[55:22] in 1950 that Pope without a rule said
[55:25] this is the truth Mary was fractured
[55:27] that there's not a bit of evidence for
[55:29] that in the Bible there's nothing in the
[55:31] Bible about that that doctrine is
[55:34] absolutely the Babylonia SH one of the
[55:36] Sun carrying the mother bodily into
[55:38] heaven so that's about that morning idea
[55:39] mother carrying the Sun to heaven that's
[55:41] really get that idea and I told you
[55:44] about this next slide look at this this
[55:45] is from Twitter I'm not on Twitter but
[55:48] this is the Pope on Twitter this is the
[55:50] Pope space seem down there and this is
[55:52] from my house browsing the internet
[55:54] today and I had this thought this was at
[55:55] 11:38 this morning on September 2nd 2014
[55:59] the Pope said this the Christian who
[56:02] does not feel that the Virgin Mary is
[56:04] her his or her mother is the orphan
[56:06] remember I preached that if you don't
[56:10] feel Mary as your mom then he said your
[56:13] fatherless like to say your father
[56:16] misspoke because you're rejecting the
[56:18] true father right you're having a parent
[56:21] that's outside of God the Father and the
[56:24] very first comments are these men
[56:26] they're like where exactly does the
[56:27] Bible teach that like that that's one
[56:29] thing I like about Twitter I'm not on it
[56:31] but that's one of the you can tweet
[56:33] right back to them and they can either
[56:35] ignore it or you know I'm I like that
[56:37] they can remake it reject somebody's
[56:39] idea and he said it's Jesus through the
[56:42] Holy Spirit who will not leave us as
[56:44] orphans I like that
[56:46] jesus said is it more than I go away
[56:48] that the Holy Ghost would come so the
[56:50] Holy Ghost can be with you even in you
[56:52] that's our parents our parent company
[56:55] doesn't stay away our
[56:57] calm down and listen up say dad how did
[56:59] the video just like I want my teachings
[57:01] of Linda Malachi I want my teacher to
[57:03] limit Lydia the case show and I'm part
[57:05] of my life to live in them same thing
[57:07] with God but God's is much greater amen
[57:09] because if my life visit them it have to
[57:12] be the Holy Spirit amen that's how we
[57:14] want the Holy Spirit to live it up so I
[57:16] show you these things are not made up
[57:17] these are true they suddenly put these
[57:20] things out there and then they make a
[57:21] man of the year and then every
[57:22] Protestant and remember Rick Warren says
[57:24] oh he's all of our past you know he said
[57:27] he's all of our Pope my whatever when I
[57:28] show that video my wife caught that I
[57:30] missed it Rick Warren says our Pope I
[57:33] like to say publicly he's not my Pope I
[57:36] have one Pope and if I have a vote the
[57:39] father that is Jesus Christ God the
[57:41] Father we have a father Pope you'll be
[57:43] the Godfather his PO means father right
[57:46] so jesus said call no man father Paul
[57:49] desert that's why our heavenly father is
[57:51] the only father we have amen you see
[57:54] that's you see the perversion here they
[57:56] hide behind this mask of holiness just
[57:59] so pure but behind it is that same demon
[58:02] spirit that was in jessabelle exactly
[58:05] right the same gods she worship and the
[58:07] goddesses that same spirit is in them
[58:09] because they teach the same false
[58:11] doctrine that's right no wonder this
[58:16] fifth age comes right along with the
[58:17] other ages and will do so until ends in
[58:20] the lake of fire
[58:21] come on listen this is the false church
[58:22] now we're the horner children are killed
[58:26] the second death there it is Mary Allah
[58:27] truth the worship of Cybele II by the
[58:31] way my man sir this did you know it know
[58:34] that Cybele ii was done and start teeth
[58:37] and Jezebel was priestess to and caused
[58:40] his gonna stumble by the license just
[58:41] rights and she conducted yes that is who
[58:44] she was in the Bible so got your Bibles
[58:45] go to first Kings 18 if you got your
[58:49] Bible I'll come back this first Kings
[58:52] 1819 we'll come back to that I want to
[58:56] show this why you're in there first
[58:57] Kings 1819 so this the base of this
[59:05] chart shows the same thing the same
[59:07] demon that Babylon worship names
[59:10] Maris was the same even at the the
[59:12] Saints are the sinners of Sardis worship
[59:14] in Asia outside belly that's the same
[59:18] demon that Jezebel worship in the
[59:20] goddess called a starchy I think I'm
[59:23] saying that right if I'm not forgiving
[59:24] and I couldn't find who a starchy son
[59:27] was when I read it on Wikipedia is said
[59:30] that she had like 77 or 80 sons I don't
[59:33] know I couldn't find this the promised
[59:35] son that came out of her but I know for
[59:38] sure the Bible says that that's who she
[59:40] works because I'm gonna show it to you
[59:41] now just so you know the Mayo was the
[59:44] major male deity of the Phoenicians in
[59:46] Canaanite so we're gonna read a
[59:48] scripture that talks about fail and the
[59:50] Groves what grows means Astarte so I'll
[59:53] explain that just a minute
[59:54] there's nothing up here if you go into
[59:57] the Greek lexicon so if you're reading
[59:59] revelation 2:20 and you click on
[1:00:02] jessabelle here's what it says in the
[1:00:04] lexicon Jezebel means chaste look at
[1:00:07] that
[1:00:09] Jezebel would've been such a nice name
[1:00:10] for Christians but because she didn't
[1:00:13] live her name now we can't use that name
[1:00:14] anymore that's a good name
[1:00:15] then the Bible say we're gonna be a
[1:00:17] chaste virgin to Christ that means
[1:00:19] totally consecrated Christ I like it I
[1:00:22] believe I have a chaste virgin to Christ
[1:00:23] but too shady that just about took that
[1:00:25] name and I've heard of that name because
[1:00:28] now we don't want that name because
[1:00:29] spirits go with names
[1:00:30] that's my good name of Ricky and Elvis
[1:00:33] and all kinds of nonsense like that
[1:00:34] because the meanies names have meanings
[1:00:37] we don't want patty needs of names so
[1:00:40] Jezebel being chaste was the wife of a
[1:00:42] I'm king of Israel she was a Phoenician
[1:00:45] princess the daughter of a king of the
[1:00:47] zygonians
[1:00:48] in her hands her husband became a mere
[1:00:50] puppet look at the first effect of her
[1:00:53] influence was the media establishment of
[1:00:54] the Phoenician worship on a grand scale
[1:00:56] on the core of a half and her table no
[1:00:58] less than 450 prophets of male and 400
[1:01:01] of Ernest Astarte let's remember that
[1:01:06] she had 400 prophets of Astarte a woman
[1:01:12] goddess so these prophets would pray to
[1:01:15] that woman God is just like the Roman
[1:01:16] Catholic priest pray to Mary I read
[1:01:18] speech first can you see the head can
[1:01:20] you see that they're praying to the same
[1:01:22] demon gonna race you think we all say
[1:01:24] amen amen
[1:01:26] they're Catholic priests when they pray
[1:01:28] to Mary or any Catholic when they pray
[1:01:30] to Mary I actually tried to this demon
[1:01:32] goddess we'd say this this unclean
[1:01:35] spirit that goes by the name of a star
[1:01:37] teeth and Cybele knee and his tardiness
[1:01:39] charge another name of this floor okay
[1:01:42] so here's our scripture you got your
[1:01:44] bodice you can read your Bible now
[1:01:46] therefore sending gathered to be on
[1:01:47] Israel in the amount of caramel and the
[1:01:49] prophets of mail 450 and the prophets of
[1:01:53] the Groves now that groves means that
[1:01:55] star T and we're showing that next 400
[1:01:58] which eat at Jezebel's table so that's
[1:02:03] what Elijah said you've got 450 from
[1:02:05] Vail and you've got 400 from the groves
[1:02:07] and here's the Hebrew word for groves
[1:02:10] right here look who it is
[1:02:11] this is a Greek word ash a rah-rah which
[1:02:15] is Babylonian for a start T so brother
[1:02:18] said that's exactly what it is the word
[1:02:20] growth can be translated as these words
[1:02:22] give me a starchy it can be goddesses
[1:02:28] images or sacred trees so that's where
[1:02:32] my dad said did you know he said that
[1:02:36] side Valley that was worship in Sardis
[1:02:39] was the same evil spirit that Jezebel
[1:02:42] worship so see how to eat with number
[1:02:44] nine Church I'm so glad the Holy Spirit
[1:02:47] doesn't die Amen because it's living to
[1:02:49] me tonight by God's grace amen how do
[1:02:51] you how do I know because I'm led to the
[1:02:53] word this year we'll never gonna settle
[1:02:55] never take you out of the word amen
[1:02:59] right let's see the same demon in
[1:03:02] Jezebel now in the Roman Catholic Church
[1:03:04] and Jesus said that woman Jezebel right
[1:03:07] called the Roman Catholic Church and
[1:03:09] woman Jezebel
[1:03:10] okay so now I'm going to close to this
[1:03:12] and I got about 20 minutes so I that's
[1:03:15] my closing pretty minute right close the
[1:03:17] look at the age of the messenger tonight
[1:03:19] by the grace of the Lord now I've never
[1:03:22] preached if so to me it's you I've read
[1:03:24] the book before but I hope it's new to
[1:03:26] you I hope there's some sense oh this is
[1:03:28] kind of new unless you just read it but
[1:03:30] even if you just read it it's a good
[1:03:31] refresher crazy for example I never came
[1:03:34] to my crib and I never came
[1:03:36] Church and regretted come I've been
[1:03:38] thankful every time I've ever come gosh
[1:03:39] and why is I know God's grace is here
[1:03:42] amen amen and though the ages of God are
[1:03:44] here and there recorded by a thoughts
[1:03:46] that they recorded my prayers make out
[1:03:48] for that and also crisis receiving my
[1:03:51] worship even in glory so this we know
[1:03:55] that age lasted from fifteen twenty
[1:03:57] seventeen fifty is the age of
[1:03:59] Reformation ours of the ancient
[1:04:01] restoration amen the measure of the age
[1:04:04] is the best known messenger of all time
[1:04:06] can you believe that I had a hard time
[1:04:07] believe that was sin Paul but he said
[1:04:10] he's the best known messenger of all
[1:04:13] time that's shocking to me but Lorraine
[1:04:15] said it I believe it he was Martin
[1:04:18] Luther Martin Luther was a brilliant
[1:04:20] scholar of gentle disposition he was
[1:04:23] starting to be a lawyer when the
[1:04:24] lingering illness and death of a dear
[1:04:25] friend caused him to become serious
[1:04:26] concerning the spiritual condition of
[1:04:28] his life
[1:04:29] he entered the Augustinian convent at
[1:04:33] your firt in 1505 there he studied
[1:04:36] philosophy house for the word of God now
[1:04:38] I want to give you a little look at his
[1:04:39] life okay here's Sardis Philadelphia
[1:04:42] later to see it okay
[1:04:46] he was born a little bit before the age
[1:04:48] and you see that he was born 14 14 83 so
[1:04:52] before the age start a little bit before
[1:04:53] the age started but he lived into the
[1:04:56] beginning of the age now John Wesley is
[1:04:58] the same way John Wesley was before was
[1:04:59] born a little bit before the folded up
[1:05:01] from an age started but brother Branham
[1:05:04] was born right with the age started he
[1:05:06] was born exactly right his three years
[1:05:08] after the age started right right right
[1:05:10] you're there so so we can see the
[1:05:12] pattern throughout the church ages now
[1:05:14] the church age messenger generally came
[1:05:16] at the beginning of the age when you see
[1:05:18] that general remember it was only
[1:05:21] Columba that was born even died before
[1:05:23] the church age started but right before
[1:05:24] and so his influence directly went into
[1:05:27] the church age because he he converted
[1:05:29] the whole nation of Scotland so his
[1:05:31] influence was major he had a major
[1:05:33] influence there now am Arthur lived the
[1:05:36] life of the severest penance but all of
[1:05:39] his outward actions could not banish his
[1:05:41] since he was a Roman Catholic but he
[1:05:43] just always felt sinful he said i
[1:05:46] tormented myself to death to make peace
[1:05:48] with God but I was in darkness and found
[1:05:50] it not the vicar general of his order
[1:05:53] stop nits helped him to gain the inside
[1:05:56] that his salvation would have to be the
[1:05:58] experience of an inner work rather than
[1:05:59] a ritual with this encouragement he
[1:06:01] further sought God
[1:06:02] later he became a priest as yet he was
[1:06:04] not saved this is this interesting
[1:06:08] church he did all the studying of a
[1:06:10] priest he did all the rituals of a
[1:06:13] priest yet he never felt peace with God
[1:06:15] in his heart praise the Lord
[1:06:17] you can go through all the motions you
[1:06:19] go through all the religious acts but
[1:06:21] salvation is something you can feel
[1:06:24] don't worry forgiveness is something we
[1:06:27] should feel are you with me turned on
[1:06:28] you should feel it tonight if your diary
[1:06:31] should still feel I feel happy not
[1:06:32] forgiving right even if we're worn out
[1:06:36] from the day we should still feel peace
[1:06:38] with God amen we shouldn't feel a war
[1:06:42] between us and God we should feel peace
[1:06:44] with God amen because he could have
[1:06:47] filled that he couldn't feel it because
[1:06:49] he wasn't justified yet oh I just think
[1:06:53] this is powerful to me now I already
[1:06:56] read this one right on his return
[1:06:57] military yeah looks like a copy yeah I
[1:07:04] can't be IKEA so I copied some of the
[1:07:06] same stuff there okay so yeah this purse
[1:07:10] was copied sorry sorry here he became an
[1:07:13] avid in deep student of the word and
[1:07:15] then the great theological works extent
[1:07:17] he was sought out as a teacher preacher
[1:07:19] for his depth of knowledge and great
[1:07:21] sincerity to fulfill a vow he had made
[1:07:23] himself he went to Rome there he saw the
[1:07:26] futility of the churches imposed works
[1:07:27] that were to bring salvation and the
[1:07:29] Word of God struck to his heart hope in
[1:07:31] his heart and said the just shall live
[1:07:33] by faith
[1:07:34] on his return home the evangelical truth
[1:07:38] of this scripture flooded his mind and
[1:07:40] he was set free from sin and born the
[1:07:42] king who got how many know how many
[1:07:43] times the judge saw that my paintings in
[1:07:45] the Bible more times the just shall live
[1:07:49] by faith is listed four times in the
[1:07:51] Bible once in the back
[1:07:52] and three times the New Testament the
[1:07:55] Josh under by page so he must been
[1:07:57] readin Habakkuk and he must have read
[1:07:59] Romans and Galatians and Hebrews because
[1:08:01] those are the four books you find that
[1:08:03] in the just shall live by faith
[1:08:04] amen soon after this he was elevated to
[1:08:09] Doctor of Divinity and commissioned to
[1:08:12] devote his whole life to study and
[1:08:14] faithfully expound and defend the holy
[1:08:15] scripture this he did and with such a
[1:08:18] fact that his heart and the hearts of
[1:08:19] those around him were deeply fixed upon
[1:08:21] the truth of the word the word soon came
[1:08:23] into open conflict with abuses of church
[1:08:26] creeds and doctrines I don't know about
[1:08:29] you but when you first got saved
[1:08:31] how many felt like a brand new person I
[1:08:33] did I let me just share my testimony and
[1:08:36] justification can I you know most of you
[1:08:39] know I've shared it I went to a ethics
[1:08:42] and action conference and they had all
[1:08:44] these people worshiping you know with a
[1:08:46] colleague on the screen and I saw a six
[1:08:49] foot six redheaded Ohio State football
[1:08:52] defensive lineman raising his hands
[1:08:55] crazy guy and I felt this big I felt so
[1:08:58] ashamed of myself because I knew I
[1:09:00] should have been serving God and I was
[1:09:01] running from God I ran from God for 19
[1:09:05] years
[1:09:05] and I looked at that man I started
[1:09:07] crying so shame on me I'll never do it
[1:09:10] again and I left my way to the boundary
[1:09:12] right there by God's grace as soon as I
[1:09:14] got hold back to Akron Ohio
[1:09:16] I just rolled by Snoop Dogg and country
[1:09:19] music and I took not all my Jennifer
[1:09:21] Lopez pictures and Jennifer Aniston and
[1:09:23] I threw everything away and I was sold
[1:09:26] out for Jesus from that moment amen and
[1:09:27] I went home to Liberty center and I was
[1:09:30] so on fire that at least two or three
[1:09:32] people gave their heart to Christ just
[1:09:34] because I became a Christian one of them
[1:09:37] was Tim Byers glory he's still preaching
[1:09:41] the message today because I because I
[1:09:45] knew what it was like and you know what
[1:09:46] I'm talking about if you're saying you
[1:09:48] know it's like to have all the burden of
[1:09:49] sin leading you and now you're forgiven
[1:09:52] and you feel peace with Almighty God and
[1:09:54] then another one a Scott Overmyer he was
[1:09:56] the bestest for a while but he's not the
[1:09:58] message anymore but we're praying that
[1:09:59] he comes back in by the grace of Lord he
[1:10:02] still goes to church and another I
[1:10:04] forgot the other
[1:10:06] but they called me and said I can't
[1:10:08] believe you're a Christian I want to
[1:10:10] become a Christian because you are and
[1:10:12] that as the same thing happened to
[1:10:14] Martin Luther he got so on fire for God
[1:10:17] that's that initial can I say that the
[1:10:18] initial I just say justification fired
[1:10:20] can I say that because it wasn't a Holy
[1:10:22] Ghost fire so I'm still doing things I
[1:10:24] shouldn't have done that a Holy Ghost
[1:10:26] cool person that won't do because it's
[1:10:28] been added so that first justification
[1:10:32] fire was so hot that it brought other
[1:10:34] people to Christ and that's what we
[1:10:36] should see in our lives our love and our
[1:10:38] joy in our peace toward God should be so
[1:10:42] inspiring to us that people should see
[1:10:44] the love of God in our lives amen don't
[1:10:47] worry just like last Wednesday remember
[1:10:48] the poor fools of God love the height of
[1:10:51] God's love the width of God's love the
[1:10:54] depths of God's love right and the
[1:10:57] deepness of God's love in them the
[1:10:58] length of God's love God's love is so
[1:11:00] great we should be overwhelmed with the
[1:11:03] love of God I know the realm of God's
[1:11:05] love is I think then you should feel
[1:11:06] God's love in your heart like it's not
[1:11:08] make peace with him and repent get it
[1:11:11] right we should feel the peace of God
[1:11:13] and I've enlisted this week you know Mom
[1:11:16] summer vacation so I have a lot of extra
[1:11:18] free time so this week what I've been
[1:11:20] traveling I've been listening to people
[1:11:21] that have left the message they have a
[1:11:22] whole new website where they do a what's
[1:11:26] it called a podcast that's the word so
[1:11:28] it's like a radio and they do an online
[1:11:30] radio and they interview all the people
[1:11:32] that left a message like Geoff Jenkins
[1:11:34] and everyone and I've been listening to
[1:11:36] these people all week and some of them
[1:11:38] say things like and one of them got
[1:11:41] interviewed that even be used to be a
[1:11:42] part of our church is on there it used
[1:11:44] to come to our church but I want to
[1:11:47] reach out and love to that as well I
[1:11:48] already have you know some of their
[1:11:51] family I've reached out in love but what
[1:11:54] I'm hearing from different people not
[1:11:55] somebody's do but different people are
[1:11:57] saying oh there's no love in the message
[1:11:58] churches and then they don't even
[1:12:00] rejoice in salvation and they don't even
[1:12:02] rejoice when people get saved but church
[1:12:05] at our church we should rejoice in the
[1:12:08] love of God I can't I can't I can't be
[1:12:11] in other message churches but I can be
[1:12:13] here
[1:12:14] and I'm the one that preaches the most
[1:12:15] here so I'm gonna preach that Jesus
[1:12:17] Christ died for sinners of whom I am
[1:12:20] chief that we might be sanctified and
[1:12:23] filled with the love of God amen and
[1:12:25] then we in our love should have such a
[1:12:28] love for people we should long to reach
[1:12:30] out and share the gospel in hey then we
[1:12:33] should love our enemies we should love
[1:12:35] those that leave the message like these
[1:12:36] ones I'm talking about I've reached out
[1:12:38] to them we should love them we should
[1:12:40] reach out to them we should have bag off
[1:12:42] them and bash them now that we have to
[1:12:44] rebuke that demon spirit yes I've got to
[1:12:46] rebuke that aside that least fear I got
[1:12:48] a rebuke that very Allah tree spirit but
[1:12:50] my prayer for doing that is that sinners
[1:12:53] will come out and be saying amen
[1:12:55] that's why we do that so sinners can see
[1:12:57] the spirits behind their actions that's
[1:13:00] why we do that but this were not any of
[1:13:02] my experience the Word of God flooded
[1:13:05] your mind amen the message of the hour
[1:13:07] flooded your mind and it costs you to
[1:13:10] burn with such a light that people start
[1:13:13] wondering what happened to you
[1:13:14] amen that's the real gospel it's good
[1:13:17] news to you right the gospel is good
[1:13:18] news to you glory
[1:13:19] under the video it was the best news I
[1:13:21] ever received him in the gospel Jesus
[1:13:24] Christ
[1:13:24] glory now he says thus when Leo the
[1:13:28] tenth became Pope and John Tetzel came
[1:13:31] to sell abilities of her sin Luther had
[1:13:33] no choice but to rise up against his
[1:13:36] anti scriptural teaching first he
[1:13:38] thundered from the pulpit against it and
[1:13:40] then he wrote his famous 95 pcs which on
[1:13:43] October 31st 1517 he nailed to the door
[1:13:46] of the castle Church right so look he
[1:13:51] was trying to stay in the church but
[1:13:53] when the church got outside the word
[1:13:54] what he had to do again to leave the
[1:13:56] church so even he had the experience
[1:13:58] come out of her my people than to be not
[1:14:01] partakers of her sins in plagues
[1:14:03] praise God she tried to reach out love
[1:14:06] he tried to change the system from the
[1:14:08] inside
[1:14:08] that's exactly right okay this is the
[1:14:12] real reason to celebrate October 31st
[1:14:14] not for Hallows even but for the
[1:14:16] Reformation amen
[1:14:18] that's the day you got you got to be
[1:14:19] happy on October 31st now for Halloween
[1:14:22] before the day Martin Luther
[1:14:24] the best zone of all messengers took a
[1:14:26] stand on the Word of God amen and
[1:14:28] started what we're joined today he
[1:14:30] started but we have today religious
[1:14:33] freedom and religious truth about
[1:14:35] salvation I have you got your salvation
[1:14:37] amen it started on October 31st when he
[1:14:41] come out of there and stood against the
[1:14:43] Roman Catholic system amen that's why I
[1:14:48] told the woman had told my secretary
[1:14:50] after school I said if they've changed
[1:14:52] and they get rid of the Halloween name
[1:14:54] and they caught harvest day I'll dress
[1:14:56] up as Martin Luther I'll do that because
[1:14:59] he was a godly man I'll dress up as the
[1:15:01] Lord Jesus dressed up as William random
[1:15:03] and they'd just get rid of Halloween and
[1:15:05] all the evils that go along with that
[1:15:07] and they want to have a harvest a
[1:15:08] celebration I'm just like a month you
[1:15:11] have to do that because that's
[1:15:12] remembering a godly man that's for a
[1:15:15] minute
[1:15:17] that's remembering a star in the hand of
[1:15:19] Christ amen
[1:15:20] born or Luther had his faults we know
[1:15:22] that he was against Jews
[1:15:24] he'd have a revelation of the VRC good
[1:15:26] Robyn and he did some other things that
[1:15:28] were off we drank wine and they're great
[1:15:30] to be here whatever but for the word
[1:15:34] that he knew he got annoyed by the
[1:15:36] spirit for what he could know in his day
[1:15:38] and then he shined it as a light and
[1:15:41] people's lives were changed by the
[1:15:43] gospel that he preached amen and that's
[1:15:46] what I want that's why he's my preaching
[1:15:47] those two it changes hearts to love the
[1:15:50] gospel of Jesus in it I don't see the
[1:15:52] whole lot but what I do I thank God for
[1:15:54] it
[1:15:54] amen hallelujah now a short time Germany
[1:15:59] was ablaze and the Reformation was on
[1:16:01] now let it be remember the Martin Luther
[1:16:03] was not the only one in there protesting
[1:16:05] the Roman Catholic Church there was a
[1:16:06] lot of protestors he was just the most
[1:16:08] successful one and probably the most
[1:16:11] famous one there were there was a lot of
[1:16:12] people that went against the Catholic
[1:16:14] Church and thank God for all others he
[1:16:18] was one of many yes others had denied
[1:16:20] the Pope's their self granted temporal
[1:16:23] and spiritual power and even amongst the
[1:16:25] Pope's there were minor temporary
[1:16:27] reforms yes there were many others who
[1:16:30] raised issues but in the case of Luther
[1:16:32] God's time was right for Deford and move
[1:16:33] that would be the beginning of the
[1:16:35] restoration see he was
[1:16:38] the ending of the restoration of the
[1:16:39] church une outpouring of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:41] at a much later day aren't you glad to
[1:16:43] be men brother branham said open up said
[1:16:46] this in the rapture message do you
[1:16:48] remember it he said if Luther was alive
[1:16:50] today he'd be in our church Noorie John
[1:16:54] Wesley was alive for those a he'd be
[1:16:56] sitting in this church he probably
[1:16:57] preaches you know because he preached at
[1:16:59] 5 a.m. every day there's a real fan of
[1:17:01] God dedicated and committed like that MA
[1:17:04] why because they believe the Holy Spirit
[1:17:07] for their day they get it crucify the
[1:17:10] Holy Ghost for their day they believe it
[1:17:11] so that means they would have believed
[1:17:13] the Holy Ghost Farrar day that means
[1:17:15] they would have said amen to brother
[1:17:16] Branham amen just like my brother
[1:17:19] preaches the word out when he preaches
[1:17:21] that word we can say Amen and that's
[1:17:23] exactly the true interpretation of the
[1:17:25] word of God Jack you're right but now
[1:17:29] remember not every word brother ran was
[1:17:31] dusting the Lord okay not every word and
[1:17:34] I think we don't have to be were mature
[1:17:35] enough to know that but when he preached
[1:17:37] that word and it's right there in the
[1:17:39] word that's God talking to a man and so
[1:17:42] we stand upon that pathetic word
[1:17:44] hallelujah remember I know he's a
[1:17:46] prophet because three of them happen to
[1:17:48] fulfill in our day right the first one
[1:17:50] is rock and roll
[1:17:51] the previous a bride the American church
[1:17:53] dance and half-naked smoke and he says
[1:17:55] it's cigarette smoking where they cut
[1:17:58] their hair
[1:17:58] dancing rock'n'roll we can see that
[1:18:01] today the second one he said he says
[1:18:03] don't never be a greater minister to the
[1:18:05] Gentiles thought saith the Lord
[1:18:08] look at that none of these guys can
[1:18:09] compare though these TV preachers didn't
[1:18:11] even come close to mother man
[1:18:13] the third one he said thus saith the
[1:18:15] Lord there would never be a denomination
[1:18:17] break up this denomination and come back
[1:18:19] to the word and that's fulfilled they
[1:18:22] won't break up in fact they keep getting
[1:18:23] more than they keep that letting more
[1:18:25] Synod they people anymore comes in
[1:18:27] they keep raised in the bar so that more
[1:18:30] goats get in the church with me alright
[1:18:33] so he was the beginning of the
[1:18:35] restoration so Martin Luther start the
[1:18:37] Reformation brother Branham glycans and
[1:18:39] unto a seed like a plant Martin Luther's
[1:18:42] little sprout that shoots out of the
[1:18:44] ground
[1:18:44] he's the sprout before that it looked
[1:18:46] like the church was then right in the
[1:18:48] Thyatira church ain't but now springs
[1:18:50] forth and sorry
[1:18:51] got life good now you can see life
[1:18:54] aren't you glad we're not we're not the
[1:18:56] shoot though we're supposed to be the
[1:18:58] seed we're supposed to be that original
[1:19:01] seed how that I did that went down in
[1:19:02] the ground where that original seat made
[1:19:04] live again amen
[1:19:07] now Martin Luther himself was a
[1:19:10] sensitive spirit-filled Christian he was
[1:19:14] definitely a man of the word for he had
[1:19:17] not only had a profound passion to study
[1:19:20] it but to make it available in all I'm
[1:19:23] sorry to all in order that he that all
[1:19:25] might live by it
[1:19:26] Marvo to this he translated the New
[1:19:29] Testament and gave it to the people this
[1:19:31] laborious work he did himself correcting
[1:19:34] a passage as much as 20 times he
[1:19:37] gathered around him a group of Hebrew
[1:19:39] scholars amongst whom are Jews and
[1:19:41] translated no Testament does anybody
[1:19:42] ever read a book that's this thick
[1:19:45] before Martin Luther wrote he translated
[1:19:49] a book this this thing that's how much
[1:19:52] that's how badly he wanted to have aware
[1:19:54] you go to have the word write for a
[1:19:56] greatest day that's how bad he wanted
[1:19:58] the Jesse Smith of his day to have the
[1:19:59] Word of God now what should we do if
[1:20:02] we've got the word we should send this
[1:20:04] unit
[1:20:04] me like what we're doing we should
[1:20:07] that's why that's why I make video and
[1:20:09] that's why I go over the same things
[1:20:10] burning up but just try to pack it write
[1:20:12] it out and preach it in a way that
[1:20:14] people can understand I'm the woman well
[1:20:17] a recent woman said I never understood
[1:20:21] modesty until you taught it she said it
[1:20:23] took your teaching for me to understand
[1:20:25] she said this should be taught in every
[1:20:26] church and so see he had a deep cause to
[1:20:30] the deep years ago to know about Bible
[1:20:32] modesty nobody was in the Holy Spirit
[1:20:34] preaching it to her until I got in the
[1:20:36] Holy Spirit to teach that it wasn't me
[1:20:39] but it was me getting at the Holy Spirit
[1:20:41] no other person could teach that to her
[1:20:43] it took some nobody on the YouTube to do
[1:20:47] that just like Martin Luther
[1:20:49] it was using nobody God just took a
[1:20:51] nobody somebody who has a burden to do a
[1:20:53] work for God and God bless them
[1:20:55] that's my church if you got a bird for
[1:20:57] Christ's great about it
[1:20:58] give yourself wholly to it no matter how
[1:21:00] hard it is no matter how many years it
[1:21:02] takes do it because it's God's work for
[1:21:05] you to do amen
[1:21:06] it's your labor I can't imagine writing
[1:21:08] a book this thick but this is what he
[1:21:12] did because he loves the people and if
[1:21:14] you love and if I love other people will
[1:21:16] labor for other people such a great
[1:21:21] testimony that such a man of God he
[1:21:23] would labor to get the people who heard
[1:21:25] of gun this vital work of Luther is
[1:21:29] still the work upon which all successes
[1:21:31] work subscription sure can't arrest me
[1:21:33] because I miss that means this book
[1:21:36] rests upon Luther's Luther's book is not
[1:21:39] at the bottom here and then we lay this
[1:21:41] one on top right this is the first one
[1:21:45] in the English I'm sorry I'm sorry the
[1:21:47] first one in German he got the Word of
[1:21:50] God in German to the people and then
[1:21:52] you've got up on that with John Wycliffe
[1:21:54] and all these guys here we come King J
[1:21:56] and now King James is on top and now we
[1:21:58] got in their own language but Luther is
[1:22:00] the foundation are too bad for her
[1:22:02] foundation I believe it was blessing
[1:22:04] rose guys love that in him how firm a
[1:22:06] foundation we have holiday via now these
[1:22:11] words really small I'm sorry I had to
[1:22:12] make them fit on here I'm sorry we just
[1:22:15] talked about the life of Martin Luther
[1:22:17] he was a mighty preacher teacher of the
[1:22:19] word and insisted especially in his
[1:22:21] first years of public evidence that the
[1:22:23] word was the sole criterion got to be
[1:22:26] the word thus he was against works as a
[1:22:29] means of salvation and baptism as a
[1:22:31] means of regeneration he taught the
[1:22:33] mediation of Christ apart from man as he
[1:22:35] was the original I'm sorry as was the
[1:22:38] original and Pentecostal concept he was
[1:22:42] a man given a much prayer and had
[1:22:44] learned that the more work had to do the
[1:22:46] more solely he was pressed for his time
[1:22:48] the more misguided gave to God in prayer
[1:22:50] in order to ensure satisfactory results
[1:22:53] isn't that a pretty to less than you
[1:22:54] learn and just like the lessons of the
[1:22:57] Thyatira church age the more you have to
[1:22:59] do the more you need to pray right as
[1:23:03] time goes on what programs say the
[1:23:05] secret to serving God was increasing
[1:23:07] your service
[1:23:09] these are secrets and these are things
[1:23:11] church I thought my heart listen these
[1:23:14] are things these things just fly over
[1:23:15] people's heads most people because they
[1:23:19] don't increase their service to Christ
[1:23:21] and they don't increase their prayers
[1:23:23] you can everybody see that that's why I
[1:23:26] think these are so Lord that's why the
[1:23:27] church ages are so hard he drives all
[1:23:29] these little nuggets and secrets in here
[1:23:31] that if we apply these to our lives will
[1:23:33] become more like Christ we won't become
[1:23:36] lukewarm Wolf's a hawk on fire is
[1:23:39] behaving what's easy kept again like
[1:23:41] these sermons these little Wednesday
[1:23:42] night you know turn tape sermons you
[1:23:45] can't let these two become common
[1:23:47] because we'll miss with the Holy Spirit
[1:23:48] saying to the churches Oh Graham said if
[1:23:51] you can't hit you know other things he
[1:23:52] said a little right over your top of the
[1:23:54] head and all the other he said the
[1:23:55] rapture will way over top your head if
[1:23:56] you can't catch it in these small little
[1:23:58] things like oh I'm more busy I better
[1:24:02] make sure that I'm praying today I've
[1:24:04] got the busy day today I better make
[1:24:06] sure I pray now how many would say help
[1:24:07] me learn my hands up we all say that
[1:24:09] well I'm gonna try with there oh I got a
[1:24:11] lot of work today we should all raise
[1:24:12] our hands say God help me man help me to
[1:24:15] put prayer first I've got more work to
[1:24:17] do lord I pray for the results right now
[1:24:20] bless me as I go on this busy day bless
[1:24:22] me Jesus be with me an audience a nice
[1:24:24] service you know he has such a zeal to
[1:24:26] do prayer to Christ
[1:24:29] martyr do it was to battle with the
[1:24:32] devil and said the Satan one day visibly
[1:24:34] appeared to him and he flung the inkwell
[1:24:36] item bidding him go tonight another time
[1:24:38] to fanatics came to him to induce him to
[1:24:41] join with them in banishing all priests
[1:24:43] and Bibles he discerned the spirit
[1:24:45] within them and set them off Simon and
[1:24:48] cam I was talking with Simon this
[1:24:50] weekend when he was here preaching they
[1:24:52] both remember seeing demons at our house
[1:24:54] growing up and I remember them telling
[1:24:55] me as boys I remember them telling you
[1:24:59] they saw demons in our closet and I
[1:25:00] remember I remember them telling you
[1:25:01] that was 30 years ago and I remember
[1:25:04] them so God has even let my brother see
[1:25:07] demons and be able to withstand the
[1:25:09] cameras going to people's houses pray
[1:25:11] for them and been able to sense the
[1:25:13] demons around him his sermon oh by the
[1:25:16] way around September September 17th I
[1:25:18] told you guys that he'd be out so we
[1:25:21] have new coming in September by God
[1:25:22] Gracie looking part of that by the grace
[1:25:24] of the Lord let's see this is what we
[1:25:28] have to understand that our prayers will
[1:25:31] move the demons back so we got to pray
[1:25:34] right away in the morning how many
[1:25:35] believe that time it'll move the demons
[1:25:37] back and he got so bad he threw into the
[1:25:39] devil MA I like to throw it's written at
[1:25:42] the devil it's rented it's regular
[1:25:44] anyone throw that at the devil the blood
[1:25:47] of Jesus Christ stands between you and I
[1:25:48] saying today amen that's what we needed
[1:25:51] throwing it to that's okay if you threw
[1:25:52] but we want to throw the Word of God
[1:25:54] it's written man
[1:25:56] it's recorded knock dr. Martin Luther
[1:25:59] and solvers in history 93 page 406 he
[1:26:02] was a prophet evangelist speaker tongues
[1:26:04] interpreter in one person and now with
[1:26:07] all nine gifts of the Spirit all nine
[1:26:12] that's why I believe somebody here may
[1:26:14] have you the gift of tongues
[1:26:15] interpretation that's two of them you
[1:26:18] know someone might have wisdom I know
[1:26:19] God has healing in my administer I
[1:26:21] believe that gift is probably present in
[1:26:22] my life cuz that seen so many people
[1:26:24] healed should say so many but numerous
[1:26:27] people get over the years
[1:26:28] and we started up pretty soon church and
[1:26:30] we get this appear we could have all
[1:26:31] night here by God's grace and that's
[1:26:33] what we want we want to see God we want
[1:26:36] to see God and then the other man said
[1:26:37] you gotta come you know gotta come and
[1:26:39] sacrifice and primarily yeah and then
[1:26:41] come on y'all create home gotta pray ask
[1:26:43] for the whole leading of the Holy Spirit
[1:26:45] so god help us to do that help us to
[1:26:47] learn that still my prayer for the
[1:26:48] church and we can learn to come early
[1:26:50] pray
[1:26:51] sanctify ourselves pray more o Almighty
[1:26:53] that he did the busier we get make sure
[1:26:55] we pray now what stirred is heart by the
[1:26:59] Holy Ghost and which was the little
[1:27:01] green shoes now here's her program says
[1:27:03] Luther was a little green shoot it was
[1:27:06] that truth was coming back to the church
[1:27:09] as it was known at Pentecost was the
[1:27:11] doctrine of justification salvation by
[1:27:13] grace apart from works forgive me I
[1:27:18] recognize that dr. Luther did not
[1:27:20] believe only in breach only
[1:27:22] justification but that was his major
[1:27:23] theme as the knees it had to be for that
[1:27:26] is the basic doctrine of the truth booth
[1:27:27] of the word he only forever known as an
[1:27:30] intern at the hand of God who revived
[1:27:31] this truth he was the fifth messenger
[1:27:34] his message was the just shall live by
[1:27:37] faith isn't that amazing that God has a
[1:27:41] different man for every age what was
[1:27:44] brother Brandon's message Church his
[1:27:46] message was turned the hearts of the
[1:27:48] children back to the Apostolic fathers
[1:27:50] any of it Martin Luther was the just
[1:27:53] shall live by faith brother Branham was
[1:27:55] you're getting rapturing faith with
[1:27:57] Pentecostal faith of the Father amen
[1:27:59] that's our cry amen
[1:28:01] we we desire that Apostolic Faith of the
[1:28:04] Pentecostal others not just for the
[1:28:06] backs of all your sweet now to have that
[1:28:08] but we want the rash of the body and
[1:28:11] then the body change amen yeah the just
[1:28:14] shall live by faith
[1:28:15] we got the just should be baptized with
[1:28:16] the Holy Ghost that goes around Stricker
[1:28:18] Amen thank you Jesus surely we admit
[1:28:23] that he knew and did teach that we are
[1:28:26] to go from faith the face he drew even
[1:28:28] he people even growing in grace not just
[1:28:30] justification he pleaded going on with
[1:28:32] God this marvelous understanding of the
[1:28:36] sovereignty election predestination no
[1:28:38] true show him to be a great man the work
[1:28:40] yeah yet I say again as doing stories
[1:28:42] God used to bring the people to God's
[1:28:44] standard against works to just Chum
[1:28:46] there by faith as I mentioned already
[1:28:50] this age was called by the disoriented
[1:28:53] period of Reformation it's exactly right
[1:28:55] that's what it was it had to be for
[1:28:57] Martin Luther was reformer not a prophet
[1:28:59] I know that history books calls him a
[1:29:01] prophet but it doesn't mean that the
[1:29:02] history book is right there's no record
[1:29:04] of Martin Luther qualifying as a true
[1:29:06] prophet of God in the grand scriptural
[1:29:07] sense of that word he was a fine teacher
[1:29:10] for some of the manifestations of spares
[1:29:12] life and we praise God for that not only
[1:29:14] amen so he was not able to lead the
[1:29:18] church back to the whole truth as when a
[1:29:20] man like the Apostle Paul who was both
[1:29:22] apostle and prophet so that's why and
[1:29:27] that's on these uh you know sites that
[1:29:30] leave the message that's one of their
[1:29:31] arguments when their arguments is Oh
[1:29:35] Martin Luther believed in the Trinity so
[1:29:37] how could he be a real light ayam
[1:29:41] rainiest didn't believe in serpent seed
[1:29:42] they said now even if that's true I've
[1:29:45] another research but even in
[1:29:46] that's true that wouldn't bother my
[1:29:49] faith because none of those men now all
[1:29:55] those men were just messengers they
[1:29:56] weren't prophets only father brother
[1:29:58] Brandon were prophets right so i
[1:30:01] rainiest martin Columba and martin
[1:30:06] luther Wesley and I guess I'll remember
[1:30:09] all those those five days those men were
[1:30:12] not prophets because they didn't stand
[1:30:14] there and say thus says the Lord so to
[1:30:17] me that doesn't stumble my faith if
[1:30:19] Martin Luther worshiped God is the
[1:30:22] Trinity because I will say when God
[1:30:24] doesn't reveal it the Bible said he
[1:30:25] winks at their ignorance right that's
[1:30:29] what the Bible says I can show you that
[1:30:30] the book of Acts the times they were
[1:30:32] Scientologists me get your hater it's
[1:30:34] like okay it's not revealed to you
[1:30:36] that's okay I'll meet at that that's
[1:30:37] what the Bible says I can check out in
[1:30:38] Scripture he winks at ignorance when
[1:30:41] people don't the Bible said where
[1:30:42] there's no law there's no sin and people
[1:30:45] aren't aware of something they can't be
[1:30:47] held accountable for it but when God
[1:30:49] reveals it now we are gone now I leave
[1:30:52] to understand by the rhythm said this he
[1:30:55] said the time is coming when we can't
[1:30:56] stand on it anymore he said Trinitarian
[1:30:58] is of the devil he said that's the state
[1:31:00] the Lord he had to say that to the
[1:31:03] people because at the time this is the
[1:31:05] last age this is the age of restoration
[1:31:08] so all the sin has to be on the church
[1:31:10] the true understanding of God has to be
[1:31:12] delivered back to the people so he says
[1:31:14] the Titus come or we can't believe that
[1:31:16] anymore we've got to leave all the word
[1:31:18] amen right Noorie so paul brother
[1:31:22] branham were prophets they have the
[1:31:23] truth they had all the mysteries but in
[1:31:26] between these five men did not there's
[1:31:31] my house so I gonna finish then you
[1:31:32] don't have a few more slides let me
[1:31:33] check it okay yeah okay oh man what I
[1:31:41] thought I had time for was to take you
[1:31:43] through all the times the Bible said
[1:31:45] justification and so here's these all
[1:31:47] these slides right here one two two
[1:31:49] three four you would think I would know
[1:31:55] after a while about how many slides I
[1:31:57] could get moving I thought I'd be able
[1:31:58] to get through all those but I won't so
[1:32:00] to finish with those four quotes and
[1:32:06] then I'll go right to that last
[1:32:08] scripture that's what you one scripture
[1:32:10] on justifications you can see in terms
[1:32:16] the reason I think this is word is that
[1:32:19] Satan's gonna battle us to not feel
[1:32:21] justified in other words he's gonna make
[1:32:23] me feel dirty he's gonna make you feel
[1:32:27] sinful right I mean we can all we can
[1:32:29] all say that right Satan isn't trying to
[1:32:31] make us feel like we're not forgiven but
[1:32:33] we got to go back to the word and the
[1:32:35] Bible said we're justified when we're
[1:32:37] baptized before I should just look we're
[1:32:41] baptized as soon as we repent we are
[1:32:43] justified and so church for what I want
[1:32:45] to know what I want you to understand
[1:32:46] the me to is we need to feel that we
[1:32:50] need to feel like Martin Luther we need
[1:32:51] to feel like we are justified God has
[1:32:53] taken all my sins away and just that
[1:32:56] just that memory just that thought in
[1:32:58] our minds will help us to have so much
[1:32:59] more joy so much more light so much more
[1:33:02] freedom in Christ you understand what
[1:33:04] I'm saying because if you don't feel
[1:33:06] justified you're gonna feel you're gonna
[1:33:07] feel condemned you're gonna feel guilty
[1:33:10] all the time and we've got to feel free
[1:33:12] in Christ I'm gonna feel free in event I
[1:33:14] don't feel for you in Christ like I said
[1:33:15] where I got strengthened in there man I
[1:33:17] just want to go up and witness and pray
[1:33:18] for somebody that's how we want to feel
[1:33:20] we can't feel that way if we don't feel
[1:33:22] forgiven we've gotta feel for you that's
[1:33:25] why I feel like we can preach
[1:33:26] justification any time because we all
[1:33:27] fight Satan every day so you trying to
[1:33:29] whisper it and God the Bible says he's
[1:33:31] accusing you before the throne of God
[1:33:32] day and night so today Satan took some
[1:33:34] time one of his demons and accused a
[1:33:36] burrito and Malachi and each one of us
[1:33:39] and all the conferees name it no said he
[1:33:40] took time and this demons accused all of
[1:33:42] us before God and so what what do we
[1:33:44] have to say we'll either feel that
[1:33:46] accusation or we gonna say God forgive
[1:33:48] me I believe my syndrome of the blood of
[1:33:50] Jesus Christ
[1:33:51] I feel forgiven again I feel justified I
[1:33:54] feel like I haven't sinned amen God has
[1:33:56] forgiven me Gloria now it's time when
[1:34:01] all we find a great change in the way he
[1:34:03] conducted the affairs in which he was
[1:34:05] involved at irsie event so gentle so
[1:34:06] fearless so patient I'm going to skip
[1:34:11] ahead of this towards the end of his
[1:34:13] life
[1:34:14] got more involved with the politics and
[1:34:16] affairs of the world okay and that's
[1:34:19] even in Britannica I can show you that
[1:34:20] to pretend so it just shows that you
[1:34:22] guys he got instead of his life he
[1:34:24] started you know getting above the
[1:34:25] things he shouldn't have got involved
[1:34:26] and but the granddaddy thought most of
[1:34:29] violence in history maybe it was leave a
[1:34:30] toe found some history that even
[1:34:33] peasants and Lorenz died because of
[1:34:34] something he said I don't know
[1:34:36] I did find where he had control or he
[1:34:39] was trying to end right to peasants I do
[1:34:40] identified that in Britannica this
[1:34:42] morning I was reading I never found any
[1:34:44] fact where he caused them to die it's
[1:34:47] possible he did obviously leave me
[1:34:49] almost a thousand history where he calls
[1:34:51] people who died but I'm just letting you
[1:34:53] know I didn't find it but it's probably
[1:34:55] enough to imagine it's the pre nice team
[1:34:56] council so here's the last words on
[1:35:00] programs last words on Martin Luther but
[1:35:04] for all that even all of mistakes God
[1:35:06] used Martin Luther let it not be said
[1:35:08] that his intentions were wrong let only
[1:35:10] be said that his judgment failed truly
[1:35:13] if the Lutheran's could get back to his
[1:35:16] teaching and serve God as the gracious
[1:35:19] brother served him then that people
[1:35:22] would surely be a credit and praise to
[1:35:23] the great God and Savior Jesus Christ
[1:35:25] amen the beautiful
[1:35:27] if the Lutheran Church could get back to
[1:35:29] believing like Martin Luther they would
[1:35:31] be a what great credit that means that
[1:35:35] most of terms are not living like Martin
[1:35:36] Luther Lynch they don't believe the same
[1:35:38] things he believed is that they got back
[1:35:41] to that they didn't get help to the
[1:35:43] kingdom of God now the just shall live
[1:35:45] by faith
[1:35:46] it's in Habakkuk chapter two right if I
[1:35:48] almost said it his soul which is lifting
[1:35:50] up is not upright but the just shall
[1:35:52] live by faith
[1:35:53] this is letting my faith produces an
[1:35:56] upright soul and that means everything
[1:35:59] feels right between you and the sins Oh
[1:36:00] feels right I've confessed everything I
[1:36:03] feel right with God the chops live by
[1:36:06] faith no I don't I'm living by faith is
[1:36:11] a life of righteous actions if item says
[1:36:14] it's Romans one they just shove it by
[1:36:15] faith because God's wrath goes against
[1:36:18] those who live unrighteous lis so if you
[1:36:20] have faith you live righteously right
[1:36:22] faith produce what faith bruce's works
[1:36:24] right now these are some
[1:36:27] Oh spiritual I might even take next
[1:36:29] Wednesday and preach all these
[1:36:30] scriptures on because they were so they
[1:36:32] were so refreshing let's stay in our
[1:36:34] feet
[1:36:34] good job get on your feet there these
[1:36:38] were so refreshing for that and they
[1:36:40] proposed it to me I was like wow what a
[1:36:42] beautiful and just took me back to when
[1:36:44] I first got saved don't you like those
[1:36:46] like to go back to that feeling
[1:36:47] sometimes that's how I felt when I first
[1:36:50] got saved that's that enjoy that initial
[1:36:52] joy and that first love that I had
[1:36:54] here's what the Bible says I'm sorry for
[1:36:57] the Hebrews the Greek says on
[1:37:00] justification it's the word night I yo
[1:37:03] ah that's the Greek word for
[1:37:05] justification it means to render
[1:37:07] righteous or such as got to be to show
[1:37:10] exhibit one to be righteous to show
[1:37:13] these righteous to declare pronounced
[1:37:17] one to be just righteous or such as he
[1:37:20] ought to be so when God forgives you
[1:37:24] your sin he said Hosea is just how he
[1:37:25] needs to be in my sight
[1:37:28] Adam is perfect in my sight he's
[1:37:30] righteous he's not unrighteous he's
[1:37:33] righteous Lydia in case you got baptized
[1:37:36] last year bad guy when if they really
[1:37:38] repented God said you're righteous in my
[1:37:40] sight you're just as you need to be in
[1:37:42] my son let me love the Lord for that man
[1:37:44] now closing there's so many great
[1:37:46] scriptures but the last thing is
[1:37:47] remember we need to rejoice the angels
[1:37:52] in heaven rejoice over every person that
[1:37:55] just gets justified yeah we have to have
[1:38:00] it down here we got to get the Holy
[1:38:01] Ghost down here actually I'm sorry that
[1:38:03] you never came up we need the baptism
[1:38:05] the Holy Ghost down there but I just
[1:38:08] want you to remember and it's a good
[1:38:10] reminder to me angels shout and rejoice
[1:38:13] when somebody's spirit just is a new
[1:38:16] heart right because that's what a new
[1:38:19] heart means the Bible said I'm gonna
[1:38:20] take their stony heart away remember 2zq
[1:38:22] I'm gonna take the stony heart away I'm
[1:38:24] gonna give you a heart of flesh and the
[1:38:26] Bible said when one sinner repents
[1:38:28] angels rejoice in heaven can I say like
[1:38:31] this angels rejoice it with a foolish
[1:38:32] virgin just like the lies praise the
[1:38:36] Lord
[1:38:36] as far as the God's eyes we're no better
[1:38:39] we just have a higher calling
[1:38:41] right we just have fire in our soul
[1:38:44] where they go but they do have pure
[1:38:47] hearts they do have a heart we'd say of
[1:38:51] justification where they now have a
[1:38:54] heart for God now is it going to be
[1:38:55] difficult to live adjust my life in this
[1:38:57] deck yes it is because the Bible said
[1:39:00] the foolish virgin worked pulley Birds
[1:39:01] into the work and program said that
[1:39:04] means everything they heard they live in
[1:39:06] nothing you think about the people you
[1:39:08] know that the churches you left think
[1:39:10] about the churches you left how many of
[1:39:12] those people do you know are living
[1:39:15] everything the pastor's say I would say
[1:39:17] the churches I left
[1:39:19] maybe a handful maybe that are actually
[1:39:23] living everything the brothers preaching
[1:39:26] so what does it make us know it makes us
[1:39:28] know we're getting close to the end
[1:39:29] right we're gonna coast in who Jesus
[1:39:32] said very few will find this way very
[1:39:35] few Evo deceivers get worse and worse to
[1:39:37] worse that's why it's good to come to
[1:39:40] church every time and examine your life
[1:39:42] because the deception is so great it's
[1:39:44] just going to get worse but worse and
[1:39:46] worse deception people are going to be
[1:39:48] deceived thinking I'm ok with God I'm
[1:39:50] right system of God I'm justified we've
[1:39:51] got but member Judas thought he was too
[1:39:53] and he fell away from it because of
[1:39:55] transgression Judas had his name on the
[1:39:58] book for the RAM said but it got blotted
[1:40:00] out because of his he said that being a
[1:40:03] traitor
[1:40:03] a transgressor that Scripture I can
[1:40:06] prove that by description
[1:40:08] remember what did the nd from you their
[1:40:11] names blot out from under heaven there
[1:40:12] was the guy that bought it out for
[1:40:14] idolatry remember they set that calf do
[1:40:18] you remember that the scripture how to
[1:40:19] treat it next action they lived far away
[1:40:22] from Troost and you remember that Dannan
[1:40:24] Ephraim so somebody had the idea let's
[1:40:25] set up a golden calf and let's go
[1:40:27] worship at this place instead of all the
[1:40:30] long drive to church look at people then
[1:40:33] oh I get go to church is too far away
[1:40:36] we'll be careful yourself an idol and
[1:40:40] that's what I think that's what that you
[1:40:41] would taste maybe 10 no no no no
[1:40:42] everybody some people I can't drive to
[1:40:45] church I just put on a taper
[1:40:46] I can't even join a church it's too far
[1:40:48] away well careful about that the Queen
[1:40:51] of Sheba traveled
[1:40:53] across the desert you get in church we
[1:40:56] got cars now that might pass from camels
[1:40:58] right Church I mean we are gonna have
[1:41:02] given so much we have to live such a
[1:41:04] high life but church if you love Christ
[1:41:07] you want to live that I wanted to live
[1:41:09] everything I freeze I wasn't I do
[1:41:11] believe I do you know I can grow like I
[1:41:14] can come a churchgoer Leah I can do that
[1:41:16] yes I grow my gifts I can grow
[1:41:18] consecration but I'm living everything I
[1:41:21] know anybody anymore I'm not a hypocrite
[1:41:24] preacher right for each other
[1:41:26] you shouldn't smoke and I go smoke I
[1:41:27] shouldn't shoot the back when I don't
[1:41:29] you come back barks you drink and I go
[1:41:30] drink in my free time I'm not a
[1:41:32] hypocrite preacher I'm living what I'm
[1:41:34] preaching man
[1:41:35] I got all these seven other witnesses a
[1:41:38] home to make sure I'm doing it which I
[1:41:39] appreciate that
[1:41:40] they vote for that but you know what I
[1:41:43] feel I feel like this when I'm alone I
[1:41:46] feel more like the eyes are on me when
[1:41:48] I'm alone than I do it around my family
[1:41:49] why is that because I Holy Spirit with
[1:41:52] me
[1:41:53] I feel like when I come to here at
[1:41:56] church and pray eight in the morning I'm
[1:41:57] all by myself I feel more can I say like
[1:42:00] this more careful my actions that I'm
[1:42:03] doing the one on that home because I'm
[1:42:05] in God's house and because there's no
[1:42:06] voices and I can sense his presence like
[1:42:10] that when you're all alone it's almost
[1:42:12] like Oh his eyes are on them even closer
[1:42:14] I want to please not right now
[1:42:16] I don't want any temptation to get in
[1:42:18] between me and the Lord I want to do
[1:42:20] exactly what's right I don't want to
[1:42:21] take any days off I want to take any
[1:42:23] time off from serving Christ because I
[1:42:25] know he's watching me amen so see when
[1:42:31] somebody gives their heart to God the
[1:42:32] Bible said they get a new heart and
[1:42:35] angels rejoice with the stony heart and
[1:42:38] when their conscience is lined up with
[1:42:41] God's Word their memory reason affection
[1:42:42] imagination even if their soul isn't
[1:42:44] quicken and they can believe all the
[1:42:46] Word of God even they don't have that if
[1:42:48] they just have this just like Martin
[1:42:50] Luther God said you're one of my own the
[1:42:53] just shall live by faith
[1:42:54] you're one of the just and you will not
[1:42:56] be hurt of the second death
[1:42:58] all right glad tonight for the word of
[1:42:59] God man let's get more around cause it
[1:43:07] this is to be a spy justification is so
[1:43:09] powerful because I've already
[1:43:12] experienced it and now Satan wants to
[1:43:14] move me away from that where I don't
[1:43:15] feel clean I don't feel righteous but
[1:43:18] we've got to stay in the word we've got
[1:43:20] to humble ourselves and make sure we go
[1:43:23] back to the word to remember that we are
[1:43:24] justified that there's nothing against
[1:43:27] Lydia Florence because she's been
[1:43:29] baptised
[1:43:30] she's repented there's nothing against
[1:43:32] Malachi race minute because he repented
[1:43:34] of his sin to the bathtub
[1:43:35] and so what do we do we must just walk
[1:43:37] in the light as he is in the light
[1:43:39] confess our sins there's nothing against
[1:43:41] Acacia Tamra Smith God doesn't want to
[1:43:44] yes sir because she's repented she's
[1:43:47] been baptized and she's justified in the
[1:43:49] sight of God amen
[1:43:51] God doesn't hold against me and so when
[1:43:54] I get convicted I say Lord forgive me
[1:43:56] and he forgives us right away aren't you
[1:43:57] glad for God's forgiveness God thank you

[1:52:10] by any means but Lord a star burning
[1:52:13] with the fire of God his fire that
[1:52:17] others to you Lord and that's what we

[1:53:22] is imputed on him and his righteousness
