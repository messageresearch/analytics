[45:08] not here jake but uh praise the lord for
[45:09] that
[45:10] and uh if we have uh let's go ahead and
[45:13] stand for the reading of the word if we
[45:14] can let's get right into this i
[45:15] i don't wanna i know we got two services
[45:17] i don't want to be too long here but uh
[45:20] when i left here uh i believe it was in
[45:22] june when we were here with brother
[45:23] brooks
[45:24] uh lord put this on my heart to speak to
[45:26] you
[45:27] and uh i just uh got it around knowing i
[45:31] was coming
[45:32] and uh just last day or so and uh we
[45:35] just trust it'll be a blessing to you
[45:37] and uh how many are glad that the the
[45:39] word of god is
[45:43] it's actually you know christ is that
[45:45] word amen
[45:46] so you know you can't always get all
[45:49] that out of a quote because the quote's
[45:50] not the absolute right
[45:52] but uh when you look at the word of god
[45:55] you see that there's always a
[45:56] a picture uh that is brought before us
[46:00] and uh by god's grace uh we're so glad
[46:03] about that because
[46:04] uh the more you look into the word of
[46:05] god the more you find that that is a
[46:07] supernatural book amen so if you have
[46:09] your bibles it's not lining up here but
[46:11] uh
[46:11] uh let's go to uh matthew 25 verse 1.
[46:21] matthew 25 1 read this little portion
[46:23] here
[46:24] and uh always so uh
[46:28] put before us here as far as uh we
[46:31] always talk about this is one of the
[46:32] most important
[46:33] uh passages uh that we see of course
[46:36] because uh this is concerning us right
[46:37] at the coming of the lord
[46:39] i'm sorry i'm not sure why it's not
[46:51] just give us a second here we'll get
[46:53] things dialed in here
[46:58] let me try that try that one hdmi yep
[47:03] gotta love technology
[47:10] it lord put a blessing on that
[47:13] we will be all right matthew 25
[47:21] we'll keep trying we'll keep going verse
[47:23] one it says here it says then shall the
[47:25] kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten
[47:27] virgins
[47:28] uh which took their lamps and went forth
[47:30] to meet the bridegroom five of them were
[47:32] wise and five were foolish uh they that
[47:35] were wise
[47:36] took their lamps and took no oil with
[47:38] them
[47:39] uh but the wise took oil in their
[47:41] vessels with
[47:42] their lamps can you put a claim on that
[47:44] and say that's me that's you amen
[47:47] that's how we got to look at this all
[47:48] right it says and while the bridegroom
[47:50] terried they all slumbered and slept and
[47:53] at midnight there was a cry made
[47:55] behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out
[47:58] to meet him
[47:59] then all those virgins arose and trim
[48:02] their lamps and the foolish said
[48:04] unto the wise give us of your oil
[48:07] for our lamps are gone out but the wise
[48:09] answered
[48:10] saying not so uh lest there be not
[48:13] enough
[48:14] for us and you but go ye
[48:17] rather to them that sell and buy for
[48:19] yourselves
[48:20] and while they went to buy the
[48:22] bridegroom came and and they that were
[48:24] ready
[48:25] uh went in with him to the marriage and
[48:28] the door
[48:29] was shut afterwards came also the other
[48:33] virgins saying
[48:34] lord lord open to us
[48:38] but he answered and said verily i say
[48:40] unto you i know
[48:42] you not watch therefore for ye know
[48:44] neither the day nor the hour wherein the
[48:46] son of man cometh amen
[48:49] let's go ahead and bow our heads for a
[48:50] word of prayer and we'll get right into
[48:51] this here
[48:53] lord jesus our precious husband oh god
[48:56] as the wife is making herself ready lord
[48:59] we come as humbly as we can before you
[49:02] today lord
[49:03] realizing that we're getting ready to
[49:05] fulfill
[49:06] this prophecy that you set within your
[49:09] word oh god
[49:10] lord you have now been in the process
[49:14] of positioning the wise and the foolish
[49:17] on the earth oh god we know of course
[49:19] it's been in every age oh god
[49:20] uh within the vine lord but yet uh this
[49:23] morning we want to
[49:24] maybe look at this picture that you have
[49:26] given us in the scripture
[49:28] and uh to be able to uh maybe just uh
[49:31] show that it is a genesis revelation
[49:34] uh uh move oh god that's hero god and
[49:37] that your word can
[49:38] just really not just uh lean on a
[49:41] quotation
[49:42] which is a great commentary but actually
[49:44] tie things in with the word of god lord
[49:47] and we know no man can do that oh god
[49:49] under his own power
[49:50] so we ask this morning oh god you'd open
[49:52] your words of life to us today oh god
[49:55] and may we see oh god the truth of your
[49:57] word oh god may it open up to us
[49:59] in a new and revealing way o god that we
[50:02] might have more faith in what we are
[50:04] where we are and oh god what we need to
[50:07] make ready for lord we're just asking
[50:08] now that you'd surely anoint me oh god
[50:10] give me strength i'm just a man
[50:12] uh mercy just that's what i need oh god
[50:15] mercy and i know we're all claiming that
[50:16] this morning lord
[50:17] but yet uh you look oh god not at the
[50:20] outside not at the stature but
[50:22] oh god you look at the heart lord so we
[50:24] ask oh god you look at our hungry hearts
[50:26] this morning
[50:27] with the wonderful worship that's been
[50:29] given to thee lord and lord
[50:30] surely o god minister unto us by your
[50:33] holy spirit in the name of jesus christ
[50:35] the church says together amen you may be
[50:38] seated
[50:45] amen we got a power point i don't know
[50:50] if we'll get
[50:50] onto it here but
[50:57] this morning we want to uh
[51:01] we want to work with the idea
[51:08] the idea of the five wise virgins
[51:12] we'll keep on trying with this
[51:16] just makes it easier to follow the
[51:17] scriptures maybe but uh we didn't have a
[51:20] powerpoint before so
[51:23] god knows you really don't need it
[51:26] because i show you a picture
[51:28] some people like things more visually
[51:30] amen but
[51:32] this morning we're just going to work
[51:33] with this idea if we can if something
[51:35] gets turned on it gets turned on if not
[51:36] that's fine
[51:37] but we want to work with the five wise
[51:39] virgins right we've
[51:41] of course heard these parables so many
[51:44] times and we realize that matthew 25 is
[51:46] is a phenomenal portion of scripture
[51:49] that's been given to us and the reason
[51:51] why
[51:52] is that matthew 25 and of course it
[51:55] works with the idea
[51:57] of the coming of the lord right amen and
[52:00] you know
[52:01] that's important to us because that is
[52:04] the
[52:04] age in which we live amen we have
[52:07] endured
[52:08] the church the bride church has endured
[52:10] seven church ages
[52:11] and now we're in the last of the seventh
[52:14] right
[52:15] amen and what makes that so great is now
[52:18] we're coming to uh the culmination of
[52:21] all these things that has been
[52:22] prophesied right
[52:24] and uh due uh to the giving out of the
[52:27] finishing of the mysteries according to
[52:28] the seventh angel by the holy ghost
[52:30] uh we realize that the mysteries they
[52:33] are finished amen
[52:34] and what now they have been brought to
[52:37] us that we might have a
[52:38] fuller and a sure picture of what to
[52:41] expect in the moments before the coming
[52:44] of the lord amen
[52:45] i don't know about you but with all the
[52:47] calamity that's going on politically
[52:48] right now
[52:49] uh aren't you glad amen that you don't
[52:52] have to get caught up in the confusion
[52:56] but you can look at the prophesied word
[52:58] of god amen
[53:00] take a hold on that word amen and just
[53:02] stand and believe it amen
[53:04] because it will surely come to pass amen
[53:08] we don't have oh i hope it goes that way
[53:11] we have a thus
[53:12] saith the lord that this bible is true
[53:15] and what what makes it so awesome about
[53:18] this and
[53:19] all you know they can go against the the
[53:21] prophet all they want
[53:22] but you know what when it comes down to
[53:24] it has there ever been a prophet
[53:25] that has gave so many types to tie
[53:27] everything in right at the end time
[53:29] they don't want to talk about that they
[53:31] don't want to talk about the doctrines
[53:32] what they might just say well this says
[53:34] it's wrong
[53:35] but you know what they can't take it
[53:36] genesis to revelation
[53:39] and that right there is proof amen that
[53:42] they don't have what they say they got
[53:44] amen
[53:45] but this is a revelation and remember
[53:48] it's a revelation given to
[53:50] the bride amen now let's begin to look
[53:53] at this
[53:53] uh i want to work with the wise and the
[53:56] foolish versions
[53:57] but i want to focus on the whys this
[53:59] morning because
[54:00] really when we look at it we focus so
[54:03] much
[54:03] on the foolish right so many times we
[54:08] well it's like a scarecrow in our midst
[54:09] oh i hope i'm not foolish version
[54:11] oh i hope i'm not judas and brother
[54:14] sister
[54:14] we can get behind these uh beyond these
[54:17] things amen
[54:19] we can believe the word for what it says
[54:21] and what
[54:22] why don't you identify yourself with
[54:24] that word amen
[54:26] because remember even today it's not
[54:28] your sacrifice
[54:29] it's the sacrifice that jesus christ
[54:32] made 2
[54:33] 000 years ago amen now notice of course
[54:37] when we're working with the wise and the
[54:38] foolish uh we know these things
[54:41] but what one had oil and the other one
[54:43] didn't right the other one ran out
[54:46] amen and over seven church ages as your
[54:48] prophet said he said that uh
[54:50] while they all slept he said that
[54:52] actually meant that they were what they
[54:54] were actually dying right
[54:55] but what now we're coming to the point
[54:57] where it's time to wake up trim the
[54:59] lamps get ready
[55:00] go ye out to meet him amen but notice
[55:03] this
[55:03] i want to begin to work in this
[55:05] direction because i got a lot to say
[55:06] in a short amount of time and i got
[55:08] everything playing here so i know how
[55:09] long i've been amen
[55:11] but notice i want to begin to work with
[55:13] this there's a wise virgin
[55:14] and a foolish version all right
[55:18] according to webster's 18 28 it says
[55:20] wise it says
[55:21] uh properly having knowledge
[55:26] now this is interesting when you look at
[55:27] the nine uh gifts of the spirit
[55:29] which one of your prophets says the
[55:30] first one wisdom don't matter if you got
[55:34] prophecies they don't matter if you got
[55:36] tongues
[55:36] it don't matter if you have all those
[55:37] things because if you don't have
[55:39] wisdom of the spirit you will not be
[55:43] able to bring it forth
[55:44] successfully hallelujah because
[55:48] what is wisdom it's having knowledge but
[55:50] it says having the power
[55:52] of discerning and judging correctly
[55:56] so you want to be a wise virgin you have
[55:58] to you have to be able to discern
[56:00] and judge correctly amen amen
[56:03] that means you gotta watch all things
[56:05] the bible says he that spiritual
[56:07] judgeth all things right and notice uh
[56:09] or of
[56:10] discriminating between what is true and
[56:13] what is false amen
[56:15] there ought to be something ringing out
[56:17] of your heart when you hear the truth of
[56:19] the word preached amen
[56:20] hallelujah if the holy ghost is in you
[56:23] you just can't help but get excited
[56:25] about the word amen
[56:27] it might make one jump it might make one
[56:29] smile amen there's got to be something
[56:31] coming up amen
[56:33] because the holy ghost will bubble up in
[56:35] you amen
[56:36] hallelujah amen it's not shiny
[56:39] glistening like hollywood but the gospel
[56:41] glows amen
[56:42] it's something within amen that reflects
[56:45] the light from the word amen
[56:49] now notice so to be
[56:52] a wise virgin means that you can see the
[56:55] difference between good and bad
[56:58] and judged correctly all right
[57:01] and notice it says in hebrews 5 13 it
[57:04] says
[57:04] for everyone that uses milk is
[57:07] unskillful in the word
[57:09] of righteousness for he is a babe
[57:13] well should we just stay right there
[57:16] just drinking milk
[57:18] that's not why he's virgin the wise
[57:20] virgin can go beyond that
[57:22] anybody can say jesus died on a cross
[57:24] and he resurrected amen
[57:27] but this word goes a lot deeper than
[57:29] that amen
[57:31] it's a lot deeper than the common phrase
[57:33] everybody will say oh god loves me god
[57:34] loves him god loves everybody
[57:38] well he didn't love esau
[57:42] i wonder if he likes the rest of his
[57:44] seed
[57:46] come on but the bible says strong
[57:49] meat belongeth to them that are of
[57:52] full age amen the meat
[57:55] of the word amen see these things can be
[57:59] so commonplace
[58:00] oh wise virgin glory to god we're good
[58:03] but the bible says that strong meat
[58:05] belongs to the person that's full age
[58:07] even those who by reason of use
[58:11] hallelujah you will have to use
[58:14] amen notice
[58:18] of who by reason of use have their
[58:20] senses exercised
[58:22] to discern both good and evil amen
[58:26] the bride of jesus christ in a time of
[58:29] maturity
[58:30] can discern between good and evil which
[58:32] is what
[58:33] that is a wise virgin right
[58:38] now i'm going to get to this uh uh lord
[58:40] help us here
[58:41] uh i'm going to stop i want to stop here
[58:43] i'm going to make this a short because
[58:44] like i said we want to say oh well let's
[58:45] preach all about the fools we got to
[58:47] make sure when you've got to make sure
[58:48] you're not full force let's dig through
[58:49] this real good
[58:50] and we never want to focus on the wise
[58:53] and then if we do we say oh glory to god
[58:55] we're the bride we're the word amen we
[58:57] got the word what is the word
[59:00] the word is a quickening spirit amen he
[59:04] takes you from being dead
[59:05] and makes you alive amen he is
[59:08] not just truth he is spirit and truth
[59:11] right
[59:14] so let's take a little quick stop at
[59:16] foolish virgin now notice this is not my
[59:18] definition this is webster's all right
[59:20] and i go by 1828 when they're still
[59:22] using christian principles to
[59:24] bring definitions foolish it means void
[59:27] of
[59:27] understanding or sound judgment
[59:31] what does that mean that means you can't
[59:33] tell the difference between
[59:34] true and false
[59:38] isn't that something because who's
[59:40] ultimately going to make you do that
[59:42] remember to deceive the elected if it
[59:44] was possible
[59:46] so you have to be wise all right and
[59:49] notice they're foolish they're void of
[59:51] understanding it's not judgment they
[59:52] can't tell if this is right that's wrong
[59:53] whatever it is right but notice this
[59:55] weakened intellect applied to
[59:57] general character notice uh the second
[59:59] definition is unwise
[1:00:04] i didn't define that they define that
[1:00:07] so you have a wise virgin and then a
[1:00:09] foolish but the very word
[1:00:10] foolish means unwise are they acting
[1:00:14] without judgment or discretion all right
[1:00:16] now notice when your prophet actually
[1:00:18] went through and i'm just going to go
[1:00:19] through this
[1:00:20] uh really quickly here but the reasons
[1:00:22] why the foolish
[1:00:23] missed the rapture were they christians
[1:00:26] yes they were virgins
[1:00:27] they were chased living a holy life
[1:00:29] right so
[1:00:31] what was it your prophet said he said
[1:00:32] they didn't go all the way
[1:00:34] to receive the holy ghost or the oil
[1:00:38] only they thought well you know what if
[1:00:39] i go to church i got the holy ghost
[1:00:41] oh i believe god sent a prophet i got
[1:00:43] the holy ghost
[1:00:44] right even some people have just left
[1:00:46] the message they they say well well the
[1:00:48] problem is
[1:00:49] is is that that he said that the
[1:00:52] evidence of the holy
[1:00:53] of being baptized with the holy ghost
[1:00:55] was to be with the word all the way
[1:00:57] and you know their issue with that they
[1:01:00] they want without understanding
[1:01:02] they say that that is what completely
[1:01:05] biased towards just believing god sent a
[1:01:08] prophet
[1:01:10] but that's not what it is to be with the
[1:01:13] word all the way
[1:01:15] is to believe everything the bible says
[1:01:18] amen hallelujah so if that was if that
[1:01:22] goes back to the book of acts
[1:01:24] then you believe every single thing
[1:01:26] that's ever been promised to the church
[1:01:28] amen
[1:01:30] they are yea and amen in him amen
[1:01:33] remember the bible says he is able to do
[1:01:37] uh above all that you can ask or think
[1:01:39] amen
[1:01:41] there's a god in this room right now
[1:01:43] that can do
[1:01:44] anything beyond your imagination oh my
[1:01:47] oh god let us get tapped into that power
[1:01:50] amen
[1:01:52] you'll only get it by yielding within
[1:01:54] the ministration of the holy ghost in
[1:01:56] you
[1:01:57] remember it's the stature of a perfect
[1:01:59] man seven
[1:02:01] that's how's the guy's looking at back
[1:02:02] there i said brother jesse
[1:02:04] ham said it yet to him but it's in my
[1:02:06] mind i said you got to give me a give me
[1:02:08] a copy of that poster back there
[1:02:10] who did that somebody did amazing on
[1:02:12] that oh
[1:02:14] i should have known that sister wendy i
[1:02:17] should have known that
[1:02:19] god forgive me because on there it says
[1:02:22] his faith
[1:02:24] his knowledge hallelujah it's his divine
[1:02:29] love amen
[1:02:30] it's his patience amen it's his god in
[1:02:32] his brother kindness right
[1:02:34] it's all him and what we can do to get
[1:02:37] away from ourselves
[1:02:40] they didn't go all the way with the holy
[1:02:41] ghost he said they were blinded by false
[1:02:44] teachers
[1:02:45] he said they loved god but didn't get an
[1:02:47] opportunity to hear
[1:02:48] the word right what we find out that
[1:02:51] they weren't
[1:02:52] prayed up oh my that's what he said he
[1:02:56] said you go pray up when they ask for
[1:02:58] oil
[1:02:59] remember there's a season they come and
[1:03:02] ask
[1:03:02] the lies for oil what's their answer
[1:03:06] here let me give you what i got
[1:03:07] you can't they got to go buy their own
[1:03:10] they go buy from them that sell right
[1:03:14] and what lastly they couldn't yield to
[1:03:16] god
[1:03:18] this couldn't do it right yes
[1:03:21] now let's continue read you one quote
[1:03:24] and we're going to go
[1:03:26] revelations chapter 4 61 279 who did
[1:03:28] daniel see coming with
[1:03:30] tens of thousands times ten thousands
[1:03:32] the saints
[1:03:33] the books were opened sinners another
[1:03:35] book was open which was the book of life
[1:03:38] the sleeping virgin oh my can't you see
[1:03:40] that
[1:03:41] the sleeping church them that went out
[1:03:44] to meet the bridegroom
[1:03:45] and let the oil go out of their lamp
[1:03:49] never entered into this
[1:03:52] what didn't they enter into they never
[1:03:55] let christ
[1:03:56] take control so he could work miracles
[1:04:00] and speak with tongues and do wonders
[1:04:03] and things to prove that he lived in his
[1:04:06] church
[1:04:08] you see we try to say oh it's not the
[1:04:10] supernatural but that supernatural
[1:04:12] actually shows that god is there i want
[1:04:15] you to see this because it's not just
[1:04:17] ordained for brother jesse it's ordained
[1:04:19] to what these signs shall follow them
[1:04:21] that believe
[1:04:22] amen that means it's your revival amen
[1:04:25] that means it's it's your god that will
[1:04:27] leave you amen
[1:04:30] it's not no longer a nation church amen
[1:04:33] this is an individual church amen
[1:04:36] and what he is the the head and we are
[1:04:39] the body
[1:04:40] and you are a member in particular amen
[1:04:45] so what is it the foolish just couldn't
[1:04:47] let god control him
[1:04:49] i think i'm going to control myself
[1:04:50] today
[1:04:53] oh i don't know about you i'm already
[1:04:54] convicted
[1:04:57] because where we're going if you've got
[1:04:59] that true revelation something inside of
[1:05:00] you should
[1:05:01] cry out just like jesus christ i do
[1:05:03] nothing
[1:05:04] except the lord show me first amen
[1:05:08] that's coming to the position of what
[1:05:11] christ called you to be
[1:05:14] all right now let's do this because the
[1:05:16] bible is perfect all right
[1:05:19] in my next slide if you see it here it
[1:05:21] says virgins defined
[1:05:23] in the bible with a nice little picture
[1:05:25] in it
[1:05:29] there you go hallelujah
[1:05:34] so do you realize that i don't have to
[1:05:36] define it webster don't have to define
[1:05:38] it
[1:05:38] the bible itself will define it
[1:05:40] [Music]
[1:05:41] all right let's look matthew 7 24
[1:05:46] he says therefore
[1:05:50] i'm unplugged if you want to try it can
[1:05:51] can she go through the scriptures and
[1:05:52] time
[1:05:53] and jump them so i'm off now i'm offline
[1:05:58] matthew 7 24 we'll probably need it
[1:06:00] because i got to go quick
[1:06:04] matthew 7 24 says therefore whosoever
[1:06:06] heareth these sayings of mine
[1:06:08] and doeth them i will liken him
[1:06:11] unto a wise man
[1:06:14] who the person that will hear the
[1:06:17] sayings
[1:06:18] and do it they're not just
[1:06:21] hearers of the word only but they're
[1:06:23] doers of the word
[1:06:26] that's a wise virgin amen
[1:06:29] which built his house upon a rock and
[1:06:31] the rain descended the floods came and
[1:06:33] the winds blew and beat upon that house
[1:06:35] and it fell not
[1:06:36] for it was founded upon a rock and
[1:06:38] everyone that heareth these sayings of
[1:06:40] mine
[1:06:40] you see it doesn't matter if you hear it
[1:06:43] that's the difference between wise and
[1:06:44] foolish
[1:06:47] hearing it and doing it
[1:06:50] see it don't matter if you sit in a
[1:06:52] message church amen
[1:06:54] it don't matter that you that you say oh
[1:06:56] oh i listened to a tape this morning
[1:06:58] that's got nothing to do with it you
[1:07:00] have to be a hearer of that word and
[1:07:02] what yield yourself to allow that word
[1:07:04] to live
[1:07:05] through you amen not a legalism
[1:07:09] but in nature that takes you over amen
[1:07:12] and you can cry out and say i am a new
[1:07:14] creation in christ amen
[1:07:17] hallelujah
[1:07:21] everyone that heareth these sayings of
[1:07:22] mine and doeth them not shall be likened
[1:07:24] unto a foolish man wise foolish
[1:07:29] which built his house upon the sand and
[1:07:30] the rain descended the floods came
[1:07:32] the winds blew and beat upon that house
[1:07:34] and it fell and great was the fall
[1:07:36] of it hallelujah your house is going to
[1:07:40] stand or it's not did you build on a
[1:07:41] rocker do you build on sand
[1:07:44] hallelujah you gotta have the rock
[1:07:46] notice ephesians 5 15 i'm gonna go
[1:07:47] through these quick
[1:07:48] see then that you walk circumspectly
[1:07:51] well that's why we don't use the king
[1:07:53] james the words are too difficult
[1:07:57] not as fools but as wise so notice
[1:08:01] now we have wise and foolish coming in
[1:08:03] again
[1:08:05] and what's the difference circumspectly
[1:08:09] redeeming the time i remember brother
[1:08:11] jesse priest's series about redeeming
[1:08:12] the time
[1:08:14] it's good stuff can't remember that long
[1:08:16] ago i'm over 40 now
[1:08:19] because the days are evil you see
[1:08:22] the more that the days are evil the more
[1:08:25] you need to redeem the time amen
[1:08:28] redeem means to buy back amen
[1:08:31] don't worry about what you failed to do
[1:08:34] amen make good with what you have left
[1:08:36] amen
[1:08:38] hallelujah that's why the bible and your
[1:08:39] prophet tied it in and said we've got to
[1:08:41] be 11th hour workers amen
[1:08:44] hallelujah remember all the rest of them
[1:08:46] say they didn't have to do as much as us
[1:08:48] but they get the same pay
[1:08:50] that is the blessing given to those who
[1:08:52] can work in this
[1:08:54] dark hour amen oh my that is grace
[1:08:57] amen turned into the rapture of the
[1:09:01] church amen
[1:09:03] so notice wherefore be not unwise
[1:09:07] but understanding what the will of the
[1:09:09] lord is
[1:09:10] see the foolish don't know what the will
[1:09:13] of the lord is
[1:09:15] we just left that passage but right
[1:09:16] above uh the rock and the sand
[1:09:18] and the builders was what those that
[1:09:21] would prophesy
[1:09:23] and do many mighty works but they never
[1:09:24] did his will
[1:09:28] hallelujah i'm going to be the wise
[1:09:30] virgin i believe i
[1:09:31] am the wise virgin well the difference
[1:09:34] you better be circumspect
[1:09:37] and what does that mean serious bentley
[1:09:38] means cautiously
[1:09:40] with watchfulness every way
[1:09:44] hey don't dwell don't dwell on these
[1:09:47] politics and things so much that that it
[1:09:48] makes you so nervous that you can't move
[1:09:51] the holy spirit gives you rest remember
[1:09:54] your prophet said he said don't pay
[1:09:55] attention
[1:09:56] to the things that are going on out
[1:09:59] there he said but get in goshen while
[1:10:01] there's still time
[1:10:06] remember when abraham was on the on the
[1:10:07] back side of the desert in the
[1:10:09] wilderness there
[1:10:10] he didn't uh he didn't subscribe to the
[1:10:13] sodom and gomorrah times
[1:10:16] he stayed out in the in the wilderness
[1:10:19] with god and commune with him
[1:10:21] but you know what that is our example
[1:10:24] because we are abraham's
[1:10:25] face seed amen just trust in god he'll
[1:10:29] provide
[1:10:30] amen
[1:10:34] watch from this every way with attention
[1:10:36] to guard
[1:10:37] against surprise or danger how are you
[1:10:39] gonna do that
[1:10:40] oh i better stock up i better be a
[1:10:45] prepper the only thing you ought to be
[1:10:48] prepping to see how much oil you can get
[1:10:50] in that land
[1:10:53] hallelujah filth fill the fill the lamp
[1:10:55] fill the vessel amen
[1:10:57] let my cup run us over amen and remember
[1:11:01] he can't hurt the oil in the wine so if
[1:11:03] you want it you can get it amen
[1:11:06] you want the holy ghost today get it
[1:11:08] amen
[1:11:09] you can't come lay on the scene and get
[1:11:11] it you have to come
[1:11:12] with all you are every cyber laying it
[1:11:16] down amen
[1:11:17] and he will walk he'll turn you into a
[1:11:19] wise version we'll get to it a minute
[1:11:20] here
[1:11:22] so what always just pay attention be
[1:11:24] ready watch your signs
[1:11:27] don't get too involved will you stay
[1:11:29] right there
[1:11:30] and make sure that you're watching this
[1:11:31] right here because here's the thing
[1:11:33] shouldn't this also meet what's going on
[1:11:37] out there
[1:11:38] yeah well wait a minute if the terror
[1:11:41] comes to fruit
[1:11:43] and that brings what and that brings the
[1:11:45] antichrist because they're all gathered
[1:11:47] up
[1:11:48] united together as one to bring him
[1:11:50] forth right
[1:11:51] right then what notice
[1:11:54] they're joining us one for an antichrist
[1:11:55] you're joining us one for what
[1:11:58] to meet him in the air amen hallelujah
[1:12:02] but notice that change it takes place in
[1:12:04] you you're not the watch oh brother
[1:12:06] jesse god is changing him amen and
[1:12:08] surely he's taking him higher
[1:12:11] but you know what you should be able not
[1:12:13] just to look at him but you should what
[1:12:14] sit in the field of the word he's eating
[1:12:16] well he's ministering it to you
[1:12:18] and you should see the great change it's
[1:12:20] bringing in your life
[1:12:23] right there's nothing that sounds better
[1:12:29] than when a pastor would hear from this
[1:12:30] church i have grown so much
[1:12:34] from the ministry of this church
[1:12:38] i remember absolutely i say oh god it
[1:12:41] must been you
[1:12:43] and it was notice again
[1:12:48] proverbs 10 verse 8.
[1:12:56] so notice the bible is very clear about
[1:12:57] this i'm going to go direction with this
[1:13:00] but i want you to see that the bible
[1:13:01] does there's there's many times where it
[1:13:04] says why is foolish why is foolish why
[1:13:05] is foolish well why does it do that
[1:13:08] see because you don't have to just lean
[1:13:09] upon a quote
[1:13:11] you can take it right back to the word
[1:13:12] of god
[1:13:14] and see what is what what god says about
[1:13:18] you
[1:13:18] and what you shouldn't be and what you
[1:13:20] should be right
[1:13:21] proverbs 10 8 it says the wise in heart
[1:13:24] will receive commandments
[1:13:26] all right but a praying fool
[1:13:31] shall fall all right so what a wise man
[1:13:35] will receive now notice he's not giving
[1:13:37] commandments
[1:13:38] he's receiving it he's always what up
[1:13:42] for the hearing of the word
[1:13:45] but notice a praying fool shall fall
[1:13:47] that word pray means
[1:13:48] to talk much without weight or too
[1:13:52] little purpose
[1:13:55] that's why the bible says we should be
[1:13:57] slow to speak and quick to hear
[1:14:01] hallelujah because when we begin to over
[1:14:04] emphasize ourselves
[1:14:06] like we are the oracle like we are the
[1:14:09] pure steward right
[1:14:12] which of course in christ we are but
[1:14:15] when it becomes so much about what we
[1:14:17] think and what we know and what we can
[1:14:19] memorize
[1:14:20] right then you miss
[1:14:23] what god is really trying to do because
[1:14:25] remember
[1:14:27] it's not how high we can get it's how
[1:14:29] low
[1:14:32] remember he said if that church can
[1:14:34] humble itself
[1:14:35] god will do some great things with that
[1:14:38] third poll amen
[1:14:39] humble myself so if i notice a praying
[1:14:42] fool
[1:14:43] that means all they do is talk they
[1:14:44] never talk about nothing but they talk
[1:14:46] all right
[1:14:49] now you might talk too much maybe i'll
[1:14:51] talk enough
[1:14:55] but the thing is let the holy ghost talk
[1:14:58] amen
[1:14:58] let the holy ghost leave you amen
[1:15:02] because no matter if you're on this
[1:15:04] extreme or that extreme or in the middle
[1:15:06] you just let god be gone and focus your
[1:15:08] attention to say what we
[1:15:10] have the mind of christ so lord what do
[1:15:12] you want me to say who do you want me to
[1:15:13] say
[1:15:14] to how can i help this sincerely bless
[1:15:16] this enemy what can i do
[1:15:19] and god will do it proverbs 12 15.
[1:15:24] [Music]
[1:15:26] the way of a fool proverbs 12 15 the way
[1:15:30] of a fool
[1:15:31] is right in his own eyes
[1:15:35] right how many people you talked to
[1:15:38] they said nope that's not what i believe
[1:15:40] you can share in the scriptures
[1:15:43] one time i was in a discourse with
[1:15:44] someone talking about uh
[1:15:46] they're all about i mean the only thing
[1:15:47] that matters to them is the nephilim
[1:15:50] there's giants they're hiding in caves
[1:15:52] right now they're getting ready to come
[1:15:53] out
[1:15:55] and i wrote a 12-page essay because they
[1:15:58] didn't want to sit down so i wrote a
[1:15:59] 12-page essay
[1:16:00] tying in the king james bible and tying
[1:16:01] it and showing it doesn't mean that
[1:16:03] and they got done and they said
[1:16:07] they said well we know it's not in the
[1:16:09] scripture
[1:16:11] but we still believe it anyway
[1:16:13] [Music]
[1:16:14] by the scripture there were giants
[1:16:18] but it didn't come by by satan's angels
[1:16:22] creating themselves flesh
[1:16:25] right i've had i've had that and talking
[1:16:27] to people they say well well god god
[1:16:29] could a good good allow
[1:16:30] the donkey to talk he can give his
[1:16:31] angels flesh that's god
[1:16:34] but one thing that satan is not is a
[1:16:36] creator
[1:16:38] he can't create that let alone the
[1:16:41] angels are not male and female
[1:16:46] so that's a lot of creatine the devil's
[1:16:48] got to do
[1:16:50] but trust me there were giants that's
[1:16:53] right
[1:16:53] but you know what the bigger issue is
[1:16:55] today there's intellectual giants
[1:17:01] hallelujah amen the way of a fool is
[1:17:05] right in his own eyes but
[1:17:06] he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise
[1:17:10] he did that you know how all these are
[1:17:12] coming back to not how much you can say
[1:17:14] but how much you can receive and being
[1:17:17] humble enough
[1:17:18] to receive something when i first
[1:17:21] started in the pipe fitting trade 20
[1:17:22] years ago
[1:17:23] they they told us they said they said
[1:17:25] never think that you're so smart that
[1:17:26] someone can't teach you something
[1:17:29] because in the piping trays there's a
[1:17:30] million ways to run a pipe
[1:17:32] he said they said it could be uh he said
[1:17:35] they said it could be the laziest guy
[1:17:39] but they said you know what the thing
[1:17:40] about a lazy guy is
[1:17:42] they're always looking for an easier way
[1:17:44] [Laughter]
[1:17:47] and they come up with amazing ideas i
[1:17:50] kid you're not
[1:17:50] i still use a lot of them and they're
[1:17:53] right
[1:17:55] they said it doesn't matter if they're
[1:17:56] absolutely dumb
[1:17:58] as far as uh they're not smart he said
[1:18:01] sometimes they have the fastest
[1:18:03] best ways that you can do things because
[1:18:05] they just take it simply
[1:18:07] they don't over complicate nothing but
[1:18:10] they said never get to a place that you
[1:18:11] think you know it all glory
[1:18:13] all right who would have thought they'd
[1:18:15] be able to tie that in with the piping
[1:18:17] traits
[1:18:18] they sure did right with the word amen
[1:18:22] let's go again proverbs 26 4.
[1:18:26] one more on this we're going to go one
[1:18:27] more slide proverbs 26 4 you've seen
[1:18:30] this
[1:18:30] yes now what you see is every i'm just
[1:18:32] bring it right through the word you call
[1:18:33] it a teaching teaching preaching
[1:18:35] whatever you want to call it
[1:18:36] but catch what it is because there's a
[1:18:39] very
[1:18:40] very clear separation even biblically
[1:18:42] between the wise and the foolish
[1:18:45] proverbs 26 4 it says answer not a
[1:18:48] fool according to his folly
[1:18:53] lest thou be also be like unto him
[1:18:57] so when you're talking to a fool notice
[1:19:00] it says don't answer him according to
[1:19:01] his folly
[1:19:03] he'll get you trying to go a certain way
[1:19:06] all right
[1:19:07] so they so a lot of people think this is
[1:19:08] a contradiction fifth verse
[1:19:11] it says but answer a fool according to
[1:19:14] his folly
[1:19:15] lest he be wise in his own conceit
[1:19:19] so the one scripture says answer them
[1:19:21] not
[1:19:22] and this one says answer all right
[1:19:26] so remember a fool is always praying
[1:19:29] he's always running his mouth off about
[1:19:30] a lot of things
[1:19:31] a lot of times you don't even know he's
[1:19:32] talking about yes sir
[1:19:34] the bible but notice it's it's not uh uh
[1:19:38] it's not a contradiction in the fourth
[1:19:41] verse it says
[1:19:42] don't answer them according to his folly
[1:19:45] so remember this is
[1:19:46] written to the lies not to the fool
[1:19:50] so what when you when a fool tries to
[1:19:52] get you in a direction
[1:19:53] let the holy ghost take you and make
[1:19:56] sure that watch
[1:19:57] that you answer them but don't answer to
[1:19:59] the insanity of the direction he's
[1:20:00] trying to take you
[1:20:03] because if you do now you're going to
[1:20:05] make him wise when you're supposed to be
[1:20:06] wise
[1:20:09] so notice we just talked about praying
[1:20:12] and so forth
[1:20:12] but the wise gives answers too but what
[1:20:15] do they give answers according to
[1:20:17] to what true and false judgments right
[1:20:20] amen amen
[1:20:21] discernment right yes
[1:20:24] sometimes sometimes just listen to
[1:20:26] somebody talk to you you get by
[1:20:28] discernment you get the actual direction
[1:20:29] of their issue and their need and their
[1:20:30] problems
[1:20:32] and how to change the subject to be
[1:20:34] where it needs to be
[1:20:35] oh help us lord proverbs 28 26
[1:20:40] it says here it says he that trusteth in
[1:20:43] his hardest
[1:20:43] is wicked deceitful above all things
[1:20:48] i want to trust that i don't trust the
[1:20:50] word amen
[1:20:51] amen so notice uh but whoso walketh
[1:20:54] wisely
[1:20:55] he shall be delivered amen right
[1:20:58] so don't trust you yourself trust in
[1:21:02] him amen in all things
[1:21:05] amen believe in him we're coming to a
[1:21:08] place that you're going to have to
[1:21:10] amen proverbs 29 11
[1:21:13] a fool uttereth all his mind
[1:21:16] but a wise man keepeth it until
[1:21:20] afterwards
[1:21:23] a lot of talking a lot of listening
[1:21:28] there are places that my mind goes that
[1:21:30] i don't want you to hear about
[1:21:33] right that's wisdom because not every
[1:21:36] thought i have is exactly right
[1:21:38] or maybe it's some some way out
[1:21:40] direction and everybody will look at you
[1:21:42] like
[1:21:42] [Music]
[1:21:46] sometimes a fool will prove himself by
[1:21:48] his words that's right
[1:21:49] yes sir that's why sometimes we got to
[1:21:50] let our words be few amen
[1:21:52] talk along the word all right so notice
[1:21:54] this we've got all these things are why
[1:21:56] isn't foolish why is the food we're
[1:21:57] getting ready to change the direction
[1:21:58] after this
[1:21:58] you know james 1 5.
[1:22:02] this to me is one of the most powerful
[1:22:04] promises to the modern day church
[1:22:06] and and and it's pretty obvious why
[1:22:09] because this right here goes right along
[1:22:11] with your nature change
[1:22:13] okay notice when you see this
[1:22:16] if any of you lack wisdom
[1:22:21] if you're a wise virgin you're gonna
[1:22:22] have wisdom
[1:22:24] but if you lack wisdom let him ask of
[1:22:27] god
[1:22:29] that give it to all men liberally
[1:22:33] a true liberal
[1:22:36] and a brain is not and it shall be
[1:22:39] given him amen
[1:22:43] so you might not have any wisdom at all
[1:22:46] any any ability to what now notice to
[1:22:49] not say too much or not say thing wisely
[1:22:51] but what all you have to do is ask god
[1:22:54] you realize this is god changing
[1:22:58] your mind from the way it was and
[1:23:00] putting you into a condition amen
[1:23:03] where you can be giving grace to the
[1:23:05] hearer amen
[1:23:07] you can be giving direction what very
[1:23:09] simply and sincerely amen
[1:23:11] to help the individual
[1:23:16] hallelujah amen six verse it says but
[1:23:19] let him
[1:23:20] ask in faith you have to believe
[1:23:24] that god can change the way you think
[1:23:27] you have to believe that god can want
[1:23:30] take some control of your mind
[1:23:32] that discernment can take control now
[1:23:34] think about this
[1:23:35] what was strong meat given to those who
[1:23:37] can discern
[1:23:39] right hallelujah
[1:23:42] amen see we should be a discerning
[1:23:44] church
[1:23:46] hallelujah we gotta discern the two
[1:23:47] spirits of the framework of the church
[1:23:49] that's invincibility that's where we're
[1:23:52] at
[1:23:53] hallelujah we've got to be able to see
[1:23:56] whether it's in the word or not
[1:23:57] lead be led by the holy ghost amen
[1:24:01] notice for he that
[1:24:03] nothing wavering for he that waver
[1:24:05] there's like a wave of the sea
[1:24:06] driven with the wind and tossed
[1:24:10] yeah get anything not gonna be stable
[1:24:12] you're gonna be a mess
[1:24:13] all the time wise foolish
[1:24:17] all right hallelujah
[1:24:20] aren't you glad that the bible shows you
[1:24:24] how to be wise now
[1:24:27] did you know in the scripture
[1:24:30] let's move in our bibles to numbers 26
[1:24:34] 52. when we come to the old testament
[1:24:39] we come to a place that we find that the
[1:24:43] scripture
[1:24:43] actually it shows us that there's
[1:24:46] actually types
[1:24:48] and one of the types that they give us
[1:24:50] is actually
[1:24:51] working with the wise virgin
[1:24:55] all right numbers 26 52.
[1:24:59] i want to go through this it's just how
[1:25:00] the lord showed it to me
[1:25:02] numbers 26 52. i want you to see this so
[1:25:04] now moses taking the church remember
[1:25:07] he's taking them to a land flowing with
[1:25:09] milk and honey
[1:25:11] right it's a great place to be
[1:25:14] hallelujah
[1:25:15] your prophet typed in two ways he said
[1:25:17] he said in one aspect it was receiving
[1:25:19] the holy ghost
[1:25:21] he said another is actually coming to
[1:25:22] the promised land of eternal life
[1:25:25] all right but notice numbers 26 52
[1:25:30] it says in the lord speak unto moses
[1:25:32] saying unto
[1:25:33] these the land shall be divided for an
[1:25:36] inheritance
[1:25:37] according to the number of names
[1:25:40] to many thou shalt give the more
[1:25:42] inheritance
[1:25:44] and the few thou shalt give the less
[1:25:46] inheritance
[1:25:47] all right to everyone shall his
[1:25:49] inheritance be given
[1:25:51] according to those that were numbered of
[1:25:53] him
[1:25:54] notwithstanding the land shall be
[1:25:57] divided
[1:25:58] by lot according to the names of their
[1:26:01] of the tribes of their fathers they
[1:26:04] shall
[1:26:04] inherit according to the lot shall
[1:26:07] possession thereof
[1:26:09] be divided or by between many and
[1:26:12] few amen so here they were coming out of
[1:26:15] egypt
[1:26:15] and god's shaking in the canaan's land
[1:26:18] and the purpose
[1:26:19] of going to that land is to receive
[1:26:22] inheritance in that land amen
[1:26:25] there is a positional placement remember
[1:26:28] even as what moses led them to the land
[1:26:32] the prophet trump them out of egypt and
[1:26:35] what
[1:26:35] the their redemption is two parts to
[1:26:38] come out but to go in
[1:26:39] amen and what god would raise joshua
[1:26:42] type of the holy ghost
[1:26:43] and he would lead the church in amen
[1:26:45] notice
[1:26:46] it wasn't just moses that would place
[1:26:49] them by the word
[1:26:50] it was joshua that would see them in
[1:26:52] that land and then place them
[1:26:54] positionally there
[1:26:57] all right all right so we're making a
[1:27:00] turn here
[1:27:02] and noticing that the scripture is very
[1:27:04] clear
[1:27:05] the reason god is sending them to israel
[1:27:09] that whole land
[1:27:10] is to positionally place them where they
[1:27:13] will want
[1:27:15] they will be exactly what god made them
[1:27:17] to be in that land
[1:27:18] amen amen amen they were supposed to be
[1:27:21] free in that land
[1:27:23] they were supposed to prosper in that
[1:27:25] land
[1:27:26] they were supposed to be happy there
[1:27:27] amen they were supposed to be what
[1:27:30] hallelujah the gates of the enemies were
[1:27:32] promised to be
[1:27:34] possessed amen that's your promise
[1:27:37] now america the devil can't hold you
[1:27:40] amen
[1:27:41] sometimes you just gotta stand up and
[1:27:43] say hallelujah i'm free amen
[1:27:46] it's like i'm saying that jesus christ
[1:27:48] at whom the son has set free
[1:27:50] is free indeed amen he
[1:27:53] set you free he filled you with the holy
[1:27:56] ghost he
[1:27:56] called you to the gospel amen it's his
[1:27:59] promise
[1:28:00] not mine amen and i'm so glad because
[1:28:03] his promise
[1:28:04] is what 100 positive it will happen amen
[1:28:11] this is the place of dwelling
[1:28:14] that israel is called to be in type it
[1:28:17] was set there
[1:28:18] so you and i could see it all right
[1:28:22] we focus o glory to god look at moses oh
[1:28:25] the word prophet oh brother branham and
[1:28:28] so forth
[1:28:31] then we'll look at joshua taking the
[1:28:32] last oh hallelujah it's past to the holy
[1:28:35] ghost
[1:28:36] holy also take us in the land that's
[1:28:37] right amen
[1:28:40] we believe those things yes we can focus
[1:28:43] on caleb's oh glory to god that was a
[1:28:45] dog right there
[1:28:46] glory gentile dog amen
[1:28:50] even the dogs eat the crumbs of fall
[1:28:51] from the masters table
[1:28:53] hallelujah did you realize that when it
[1:28:55] came to the syrophoenician woman
[1:28:58] jesus told her no that's right i got
[1:29:01] nothing to do with you
[1:29:03] yes but she answered
[1:29:06] that beautiful statement is that
[1:29:09] even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall
[1:29:13] from the master's table and then
[1:29:15] she told him no or he told her no
[1:29:19] amen and jesus would respond to her
[1:29:22] that way and instead of her getting mad
[1:29:24] at jesus
[1:29:25] you see sometimes god ain't telling you
[1:29:27] no amen
[1:29:28] but god knows that you have a faith to
[1:29:31] stay
[1:29:31] with it it's his promise amen
[1:29:37] jesus said i have not seen so much faith
[1:29:39] in all israel amen
[1:29:42] hallelujah so just because it don't
[1:29:45] happen doesn't mean it's not
[1:29:47] just it looks like god said no amen all
[1:29:49] you got to do
[1:29:50] your prophet said you gotta be a crumb
[1:29:52] hunter amen
[1:29:54] hallelujah just keep looking on that
[1:29:57] ground for some crumbs amen
[1:29:59] how do you say glad because today it's
[1:30:02] no longer israel at the time now it's
[1:30:04] the gentile church
[1:30:06] he says i call you no more servants but
[1:30:09] i call you
[1:30:10] sons amen
[1:30:18] hallelujah
[1:30:20] the whole purpose that they were to go
[1:30:22] into the land
[1:30:23] was inheritance to be positionally
[1:30:25] placed there
[1:30:27] let's look at this now numbers 27
[1:30:30] verse ones numbers 27 verse 1.
[1:30:39] we come to this story about these
[1:30:41] daughters
[1:30:44] and this is so perfect scripture i just
[1:30:45] love it i know you'll be blessed
[1:30:48] numbers 27 1 it says then came the
[1:30:51] daughters
[1:30:52] of salafat the son of hefor the son of
[1:30:55] gilead the son of mecca
[1:30:56] the son of manasseh of the families of
[1:30:59] manasseh the son of joseph
[1:31:00] and these are the names of his daughters
[1:31:03] now count them with me
[1:31:04] mala noah haglab
[1:31:07] milka tirsa
[1:31:11] five daughters
[1:31:14] now what do these daughters want
[1:31:19] what do these virgins want
[1:31:23] i wonder
[1:31:27] second verse it says and they stood
[1:31:29] before moses
[1:31:31] and before eliezer the priest and before
[1:31:33] the princes of all the congregation by
[1:31:35] the door of the tabernacle of the
[1:31:37] congregation
[1:31:37] saying our father died in
[1:31:41] the wilderness
[1:31:45] oh aren't you glad
[1:31:48] and he was not in the company of them
[1:31:51] that gathered themselves together
[1:31:53] against the lord in the company of korah
[1:31:56] but died in his own sin and had no sons
[1:31:59] why should the name of our father be
[1:32:02] done away
[1:32:04] from among his family because he hath no
[1:32:07] son
[1:32:08] give unto us therefore a possession
[1:32:11] among the brethren of our father
[1:32:16] so now here these these wise virgins now
[1:32:19] notice
[1:32:19] this is not happening by chance
[1:32:23] this is 100 predestined by god
[1:32:28] this the word always was amen
[1:32:32] it might have been living out but that
[1:32:33] in that dimension
[1:32:35] the word had already been brought forth
[1:32:38] amen that's eternity
[1:32:41] yes so notice these five
[1:32:44] virgins if i call them five wise virgins
[1:32:48] they come approaching moses
[1:32:51] yes and they want to not they're
[1:32:54] interested in one thing
[1:32:57] the posterity or the continuation of
[1:33:00] their father's name
[1:33:06] because he was the one that died in the
[1:33:08] wilderness
[1:33:09] of his own sins aren't you glad
[1:33:13] that jesus christ died for your sins
[1:33:16] amen
[1:33:19] he took your sins so that you could
[1:33:22] become the righteousness of god amen
[1:33:24] hallelujah i hope you feel the holy
[1:33:27] ghost here because he
[1:33:28] is here amen that means all things are
[1:33:32] possible amen
[1:33:34] hallelujah if you believe it all things
[1:33:36] are
[1:33:37] possible amen
[1:33:40] now notice this this father
[1:33:44] he died in the wilderness but notice he
[1:33:47] did not
[1:33:48] gather in the company of unbelief
[1:33:52] but he stayed right with
[1:33:55] the word amen amen
[1:33:59] what i only do that which pleases the
[1:34:01] father
[1:34:03] yes sir yes sir there's no rebellion
[1:34:09] hallelujah now notice
[1:34:13] let's begin to look at this that name
[1:34:15] zalafa hat
[1:34:17] it means in definition firstborn
[1:34:22] the name means firstborn
[1:34:26] praise god the father's name was the
[1:34:28] firstborn
[1:34:31] colossians 1 13 says who have delivered
[1:34:34] us from the power of darkness and have
[1:34:36] translated us
[1:34:37] into the kingdom of his dear son in whom
[1:34:40] we have redemption through his blood
[1:34:42] even the forgiveness of sins who is the
[1:34:44] image of the invisible god
[1:34:46] the firstborn of every creature
[1:34:56] you know those names have meanings your
[1:34:58] prophet talked about that
[1:35:00] they mean something roger don't name him
[1:35:03] ricky don't name him elvis
[1:35:07] for by him or all things created that
[1:35:09] are in heaven
[1:35:10] that are on earth uh visible and
[1:35:12] invisible whether they be thrones or
[1:35:13] dominions
[1:35:14] or principalities or powers all things
[1:35:16] were created by him and
[1:35:18] for him and he is before all things
[1:35:21] and by him all things consist see
[1:35:25] it's not that just the son of man just
[1:35:26] came
[1:35:28] he was the logos just taking on
[1:35:31] flesh god and flesh he is the head of
[1:35:35] the body
[1:35:36] the church who is the beginning the
[1:35:38] firstborn from
[1:35:39] the dead then that in all things he
[1:35:42] might have the preeminence
[1:35:45] so this is ahead notice these five
[1:35:49] wise virgins what they want is what the
[1:35:52] name of their father cannot be removed
[1:35:56] from the inheritance in the land
[1:36:01] hallelujah so they could have been
[1:36:03] ephraim and dan and all them
[1:36:05] and what even the tribe of manasseh but
[1:36:07] they looked
[1:36:08] and for some reason something rose up in
[1:36:10] them
[1:36:13] hallelujah see jesus only has
[1:36:17] five virgins that's the bride he's after
[1:36:24] notice they wanted what they wanted
[1:36:28] to be recognized in the land
[1:36:32] notice they were fighting for what to
[1:36:35] just be an
[1:36:37] they were fighting to be a joint heir to
[1:36:41] everything his name promised them
[1:36:48] oh hallelujah ephesians 1 10
[1:36:51] it says that in the dispensation of the
[1:36:53] fullness of times
[1:36:54] he might gather together in one thing
[1:36:56] one all things in christ
[1:36:58] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:37:00] in earth even in him
[1:37:02] in whom also we have obtained an
[1:37:04] inheritance
[1:37:05] being predestinated according to the
[1:37:08] purpose of him
[1:37:09] who worketh all things after the council
[1:37:12] of his own
[1:37:13] will see that it was god's desire
[1:37:17] what through jesus christ who give you
[1:37:20] inheritance
[1:37:23] and what is it that we should be to the
[1:37:25] praise of his glory
[1:37:27] [Music]
[1:37:29] these persians were going to be the
[1:37:30] praise to his glory
[1:37:33] who first trusted in christ and whom he
[1:37:35] also trusted
[1:37:36] after that he heard the word of truth
[1:37:38] the gospel of your salvation in whom
[1:37:40] also after that ye believed
[1:37:41] you were sealed with that holy spirit of
[1:37:44] promise
[1:37:44] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:37:48] until the redemption of the purchased
[1:37:50] possession
[1:37:51] unto the praise of his glory amen so
[1:37:54] getting in that land what
[1:37:58] they're the earnest of their inheritance
[1:38:00] right
[1:38:01] that's the baptism of holy ghost we
[1:38:03] should be there right now
[1:38:05] now we are fighting for what positional
[1:38:07] placement in that land
[1:38:11] so notice if you're the wise virgin now
[1:38:14] you always were the wise virgin
[1:38:16] but what you recognized that your
[1:38:19] father's name had posterity
[1:38:21] and that it had to remain amen it wasn't
[1:38:24] three persons it was one person amen
[1:38:28] hallelujah and what that name is all
[1:38:31] powerful the firstborn of creation amen
[1:38:36] now let's look at this so when did
[1:38:38] numbers 26 happen
[1:38:41] it actually happened before
[1:38:44] they actually went into the land they
[1:38:46] were talking to moses
[1:38:48] i want you to see that this wise virgin
[1:38:51] these wise virgins they believed that
[1:38:54] israel was going to have possession
[1:38:59] we're ten spies didn't belief
[1:39:06] when they looked at the land say that
[1:39:07] land's two the people are two greats too
[1:39:08] many
[1:39:10] we're grasshoppers go back to giants oh
[1:39:12] no
[1:39:14] they looked at that land
[1:39:17] and what they seen enough of the message
[1:39:21] of their hour
[1:39:22] to say i believe that we are going to
[1:39:26] possess this land
[1:39:28] see what i'm saying once moses was off
[1:39:31] the scene
[1:39:31] they weren't quitting they weren't going
[1:39:34] to start judging his signs to see
[1:39:36] whether he was the true prophet
[1:39:40] hallelujah they it didn't matter it
[1:39:42] didn't matter that they heard that
[1:39:43] moses was a murderer they didn't go back
[1:39:47] in the archives
[1:39:48] and try to prove everything and try to
[1:39:51] find a thought with the word
[1:39:55] hallelujah but they received the message
[1:39:57] and they
[1:39:58] realized that moses was not perfect amen
[1:40:02] but they believed the word sign that
[1:40:05] came through that prophet amen
[1:40:09] that prophet said they will take the
[1:40:11] land amen
[1:40:12] therefore they believed amen
[1:40:17] hallelujah so notice
[1:40:21] this is beforehand they're crying out
[1:40:22] for these things
[1:40:24] you see they didn't just believe that
[1:40:26] israel is going to do it they believe
[1:40:27] that
[1:40:28] as israel walked through it they were
[1:40:29] walking right with them amen hallelujah
[1:40:38] so notice what they do though
[1:40:42] was it something easy they had to do
[1:40:44] even before israel
[1:40:45] had went for these people are
[1:40:46] complaining about manna these people
[1:40:48] complain about quail they're complaining
[1:40:49] about everything you can think of
[1:40:51] and these five versions they're just
[1:40:52] glad to be part of the company
[1:40:54] [Laughter]
[1:40:57] hallelujah they've seen enough when
[1:40:59] they've seen a pillar of fire by not in
[1:41:01] the cloud by day when they've seen the
[1:41:02] red sea open up when they've seen the
[1:41:04] manna fall amen when they see the quail
[1:41:06] come
[1:41:06] when they see the rock split open and
[1:41:08] give them water they knew amen
[1:41:10] that the message was right amen they
[1:41:13] could put
[1:41:13] their trust in god amen
[1:41:18] hallelujah
[1:41:22] but notice what they did they actually
[1:41:25] had to appeal
[1:41:27] they had to come with boldness and
[1:41:29] that's something
[1:41:30] what's revelations 10 say
[1:41:34] they had to go and say give me the book
[1:41:39] glory they had to come and cry out
[1:41:44] they had to take a step of boldness
[1:41:47] to receive inheritance remember
[1:41:50] women were like property then
[1:41:53] women were not esteemed remember that's
[1:41:56] why their lineages
[1:41:57] are rarely in there outside of tight
[1:41:59] form
[1:42:00] well whether you can see it that's why
[1:42:01] these daughters are here
[1:42:05] you see people look at them say it's an
[1:42:07] insignificant no it's a type
[1:42:09] of the bride amen
[1:42:14] if you want to make a rapture you got to
[1:42:16] go to christ amen
[1:42:18] amen hallelujah this message will lead
[1:42:20] you there
[1:42:21] but you're not just drawing to the
[1:42:23] messenger now notice
[1:42:25] they went to moses but they weren't
[1:42:27] going to moses because he was god
[1:42:31] they were going there because they knew
[1:42:33] that through
[1:42:34] him the word was going to come forth
[1:42:37] amen
[1:42:41] it's too late to turn back brother
[1:42:42] sister don't let the devil tell you
[1:42:44] nothing
[1:42:45] it's right amen amen
[1:42:49] that's why i dig this way brother says
[1:42:51] this is why god lets me do this i love
[1:42:54] it i ain't worried about no cloud
[1:42:58] the cloud isn't the one thing holding me
[1:43:10] it didn't say that the seventh angel you
[1:43:12] know it by the cloud
[1:43:15] say you didn't say you know about a
[1:43:16] municipal bridge
[1:43:18] it said you know it by the finishing of
[1:43:21] the mysteries amen
[1:43:24] if you're not looking at the mysteries
[1:43:26] you don't have the right revelation amen
[1:43:29] and those mysteries must be joined to
[1:43:31] the word amen
[1:43:33] don't you think god ordained a seventh
[1:43:35] seventh angel to be a seventh grader
[1:43:38] educated and everybody wants a perfect
[1:43:41] theologian
[1:43:43] really who's seventh grade here anybody
[1:43:48] anybody got a bunch of children here by
[1:43:52] eighth grader
[1:43:54] malcolm okay malachi come up here and
[1:43:57] tell me the whole mystery of god brother
[1:43:59] [Music]
[1:44:01] you think you might mess up a couple
[1:44:02] times maybe once or twice maybe once or
[1:44:05] twice
[1:44:08] but what is it they can't look through
[1:44:11] the veil of humanity
[1:44:13] they can't figure it out and what you
[1:44:15] notice what they do
[1:44:16] they intellectualize everything and then
[1:44:18] they miss faith yes sir yes sir
[1:44:21] you don't think that with all these you
[1:44:24] know
[1:44:24] four failed prophecies supposedly and
[1:44:26] whatever you don't think that the
[1:44:27] devil's trying to do everything he can
[1:44:29] behind the scenes to to
[1:44:30] to change the change what that is
[1:44:35] no the devil can't do that huh
[1:44:39] so he comes in the church every single
[1:44:41] time and tries to destroy your
[1:44:42] atmosphere
[1:44:44] tries to destroy your healing tries to
[1:44:46] destroy
[1:44:47] your faith from rising up and he's not
[1:44:50] going to try
[1:44:51] to discredit the seventh angel messenger
[1:44:55] that's insanity when he tried to take
[1:44:56] him out all those times
[1:44:58] [Music]
[1:45:00] but you see what it is they don't get it
[1:45:03] right and what they end up doing they
[1:45:04] end up what they end up
[1:45:06] moving their intellectualism above what
[1:45:09] the promise word is
[1:45:10] yeah yes sir
[1:45:16] it doesn't sound good so notice
[1:45:20] they had to go through moses in order to
[1:45:23] get the word of the lord
[1:45:26] they have a problem with that they came
[1:45:28] boldly in their season knowing where the
[1:45:30] word come from
[1:45:32] right yes that's why that's why
[1:45:34] rapturing faith is in this message
[1:45:35] is that the message but the message
[1:45:39] isn't just quotes the message is christ
[1:45:40] himself
[1:45:41] amen amen it's the word of god amen
[1:45:44] that's why we do this because we can see
[1:45:45] it in the word of god
[1:45:48] now notice it was the prophet that would
[1:45:51] give them their inheritance
[1:45:54] from the lord
[1:45:59] go beyond the curtain of time you can
[1:46:01] see the preview of the bride
[1:46:03] you can see what the seals are
[1:46:08] let's continue numbers 27 verse 5.
[1:46:14] i just hit one hour let me give me a
[1:46:17] little bit i got
[1:46:18] i got a little bit more to go a couple
[1:46:19] more i hope you can see this yeah
[1:46:21] beautiful see you see how this is it's
[1:46:23] perfect perfect i'm not in there yet but
[1:46:25] you're gonna get more excited
[1:46:27] because the word of god is that rich i'm
[1:46:30] not rich you're not rich he's rich
[1:46:32] he's the giver of all good things amen
[1:46:34] he is the one
[1:46:35] that led captivity captive and gave
[1:46:38] gifts
[1:46:38] unto men amen the one the
[1:46:42] only the lord of creation lord jesus
[1:46:46] christ amen
[1:46:48] he came love you and died for you
[1:46:53] so you can watch you can live out the
[1:46:55] son of god administration in the
[1:46:57] fullness of the stature of christ
[1:47:04] so what the word prophet do and moses
[1:47:07] brought their cause before the lord
[1:47:10] see moses didn't say aye you're women
[1:47:11] yep sorry sorry no go
[1:47:13] no go you're just property
[1:47:18] the lord came to moses amen
[1:47:22] all right moses brought up the cause
[1:47:23] before the lord and the lord spake unto
[1:47:25] moses
[1:47:26] saying the daughters of zelophehad
[1:47:29] speak right
[1:47:33] they deserve an inheritance
[1:47:36] thou shalt surely give them a possession
[1:47:39] of an
[1:47:40] inheritance among their father's
[1:47:42] brethren
[1:47:43] and thou shalt cause the inheritance of
[1:47:46] their father to pass
[1:47:47] unto them
[1:47:51] so the inheritance of the father the
[1:47:54] fullness of what he had
[1:47:55] was to pass to his daughters
[1:47:59] the wise virgins
[1:48:02] why do you think brother sister we read
[1:48:04] that quote and he said they never
[1:48:06] got so yielded so that christ could
[1:48:09] control them
[1:48:10] so that he could completely live through
[1:48:12] them in supernatural
[1:48:14] wonders in the word right
[1:48:18] why is that don't you realize that's the
[1:48:21] down payment of your inheritance
[1:48:22] hallelujah but god just doesn't stop
[1:48:24] there by giving you the holy ghost he
[1:48:25] takes you all the way through those
[1:48:27] seven virtues
[1:48:28] right to the place that i mean just like
[1:48:31] we have
[1:48:31] when when when they when god told
[1:48:33] brother brandon pick up your pen and
[1:48:34] write
[1:48:35] yes because you become so much like him
[1:48:37] that you're in his very image
[1:48:41] hallelujah yes sir the new race
[1:48:46] a powerhouse amen the manifestations of
[1:48:50] the sons and daughters of god
[1:48:52] amen amen so notice
[1:48:56] god tells them yeah they get the
[1:48:57] inheritance you know manessa one of the
[1:48:59] bigger tribes
[1:49:02] notice and thou shalt speak unto the
[1:49:04] children of israel saying if a man died
[1:49:06] have no son
[1:49:07] then he shall cause his inheritance to
[1:49:08] pass unto his daughter
[1:49:11] and if he have no daughter then ye shall
[1:49:13] give his inheritance to the brother if
[1:49:14] you have no brethren
[1:49:15] then you shall give his inheritance unto
[1:49:17] his father's brother let's move on
[1:49:19] okay so just laying down the law
[1:49:22] that that watch god is showing that what
[1:49:24] if that man died
[1:49:26] and he was in the cause of the lord what
[1:49:28] he would have the
[1:49:29] father's inheritance
[1:49:31] [Music]
[1:49:33] well notice the type because it's really
[1:49:35] all about the five wise virgins
[1:49:39] so according to numbers 26 33 reading it
[1:49:42] again it says the names of the daughters
[1:49:44] of zelapa had were mala noah
[1:49:48] milka and turza now look what these
[1:49:51] names mean
[1:49:53] mala means infirmity but it has a double
[1:49:57] meaning
[1:49:57] of pardon
[1:50:00] amen so they in another
[1:50:04] uh uh translation of it they said
[1:50:06] disease
[1:50:07] disease and then pardon me
[1:50:13] mala the first one the second one is
[1:50:16] noah
[1:50:18] which means consolation or comfort
[1:50:21] and also rest
[1:50:25] so it goes from disease to pardon to
[1:50:28] consolation rest
[1:50:32] then hoga means his festival or
[1:50:37] it dance like you're living in the feast
[1:50:39] of pentecost
[1:50:42] oh my milka means queen
[1:50:51] hallelujah seems like it's
[1:50:55] naming out some characteristics of the
[1:50:57] wise version
[1:51:00] beautiful i like this one
[1:51:04] tirsa tirsa means
[1:51:08] benevolent and pleasing
[1:51:12] pleasing you know what enoch means
[1:51:18] pleasing
[1:51:24] so these five wise virgins even their
[1:51:26] names
[1:51:27] correspond to the wise virgins
[1:51:33] hallelujah
[1:51:37] notice
[1:51:42] so in numbers 36 for time's sake let's
[1:51:45] let's skip this part here
[1:51:46] but number 36 numbers 36
[1:51:49] it they have a portion from 36 1 to 7
[1:51:52] where the tribe of manasseh comes forth
[1:51:54] now that they've heard about these
[1:51:56] daughters
[1:51:58] and they want to know hey where's this
[1:52:01] inheritance going to pass from
[1:52:04] it ought to stay in our tribe
[1:52:08] so once again the lord has to command
[1:52:11] that the inheritance
[1:52:12] stays in the family of manasseh
[1:52:16] now remember menasha is joseph's child
[1:52:22] all right and in genesis 41 51
[1:52:26] it says and joseph
[1:52:29] called the name of the firstborn
[1:52:31] manasseh
[1:52:32] for god he say it said he hath made me
[1:52:35] forget
[1:52:36] all my toil and all my father's house
[1:52:42] so they had to stay in the family of
[1:52:46] manasseh which was the family where what
[1:52:50] the name actually means to forget all
[1:52:53] the toil
[1:52:57] and all of the father's house remember
[1:53:01] it was joseph that was what betrayed by
[1:53:03] the family
[1:53:08] and these five daughters you stay there
[1:53:12] i'm talking about the five wise virgins
[1:53:15] forget about how the denominations treat
[1:53:17] you if you stay
[1:53:19] in the your positional placement in this
[1:53:22] land
[1:53:22] it will make you forget all the troubles
[1:53:25] you've had to go through
[1:53:30] hallelujah get out of the dam
[1:53:32] [Laughter]
[1:53:34] hallelujah get out of there to sin come
[1:53:37] back to the fullness of christ amen
[1:53:39] or you in the rest of christ where you
[1:53:41] can forget all the toil
[1:53:44] all right
[1:53:47] i want you to see this very quickly
[1:53:48] joshua 17 1. we're going to close pretty
[1:53:50] quick here
[1:53:55] joshua 17 1 of course what is joshua
[1:53:57] that's when they take the land joshua 17
[1:53:59] is what now positional placement
[1:54:02] i want you to show this because it's not
[1:54:04] like these daughters these wise virgins
[1:54:06] came before and just stopped
[1:54:09] but just like we had a caleb
[1:54:15] caleb came after he fought and he came
[1:54:18] to joshua he said okay
[1:54:20] i'm 85 years old give me my mountain
[1:54:23] where are the giants at give them to me
[1:54:25] i'll take them
[1:54:28] amen but what
[1:54:32] he boldly came and what he
[1:54:35] showed that he was enthusiastic and he
[1:54:38] was what
[1:54:40] he was putting the push on he wanted his
[1:54:42] inheritance
[1:54:44] amen joshua 17 1 and there was
[1:54:47] also a lot for the tribe of manasseh
[1:54:49] where he was the firstborn of joseph
[1:54:51] once again the firstborn joseph who
[1:54:53] joseph the type of christ
[1:54:57] for mackerel the firstborn of manasseh
[1:54:59] the father gilead because he was a man
[1:55:00] of war therefore he had gilead and
[1:55:01] deshaun let's move down third verse
[1:55:03] third verse says zelapha had the son of
[1:55:05] hebrew the son of god the son of
[1:55:07] macarthur the son of manasseh had no
[1:55:08] sons but daughters and these are the
[1:55:10] names of his daughters
[1:55:11] mala and noah milka and tirzah and they
[1:55:14] came near
[1:55:15] before eliezer the priest and before
[1:55:18] joshua the son of nun
[1:55:19] and before the princes saying the lord
[1:55:21] commanded moses
[1:55:25] we didn't forget
[1:55:29] the lord commanded moses
[1:55:35] to give us an inheritance among our
[1:55:36] brother therefore according to the
[1:55:38] commandment of the lord
[1:55:39] he gave them an inheritance among the
[1:55:42] brethren of their father
[1:55:43] and there fell ten portions to manasseh
[1:55:46] beside the land of gilead and michonne
[1:55:49] which were on the other side of jordan
[1:55:50] amen so what did they do
[1:55:53] did they just let it go no everybody
[1:55:56] else has got the holy ghost everybody
[1:55:58] else's
[1:56:00] they came just like caleb he said moses
[1:56:03] promised
[1:56:03] where's it at let's do it i'm ready for
[1:56:06] my inheritance
[1:56:09] hallelujah but brother sister even look
[1:56:11] at it because
[1:56:12] the five daughters they didn't even have
[1:56:14] to fight
[1:56:20] the whole of israel fought the battle
[1:56:22] and all they wanted
[1:56:24] they had such a positional placement
[1:56:26] through their father
[1:56:28] all they had to do was to walk in the
[1:56:31] land with the church amen
[1:56:33] and they had positional placement amen
[1:56:39] hallelujah that's why the bible says he
[1:56:40] that's entered in has ceased from his
[1:56:42] labor amen
[1:56:47] hallelujah i hope you feel free brother
[1:56:50] sister you
[1:56:50] have an inheritance it's powerful amen
[1:56:53] it's loving
[1:56:54] it's last amen
[1:56:57] god promised you your inheritance if you
[1:56:59] have a different holy ghost you need to
[1:57:00] get the right revelation of it amen
[1:57:03] amen hallelujah make these little
[1:57:05] pentecostals run around look at that
[1:57:07] hallelujah
[1:57:09] amen that was perfected praise through
[1:57:13] these little sucklings
[1:57:14] [Music]
[1:57:16] now notice
[1:57:21] let's skip that let's go there
[1:57:25] galatians 4 4 almost done but when the
[1:57:27] fullness of time was come god sent forth
[1:57:28] his son
[1:57:29] made of a woman made under the law to
[1:57:31] redeem them that were under the law that
[1:57:33] we might receive the adoption of sons
[1:57:35] what's that positional placement and
[1:57:38] because your sons god has sent forth the
[1:57:40] spirit of
[1:57:40] his son into your hearts crying abba
[1:57:42] father
[1:57:44] wherefore thou art no more a servant
[1:57:47] you're not just a woman
[1:57:52] but a son and if a son then an heir of
[1:57:54] god through christ
[1:57:56] just making a statement there yes sir
[1:57:59] [Music]
[1:58:03] one more portion let's see if i can find
[1:58:04] it where'd it go

[1:59:30] i want you to see this number 27 12 this
[1:59:32] is this is beautiful
[1:59:34] let me see this so this is just
[1:59:36] finishing
[1:59:37] the commandment to the daughters of
[1:59:39] zelophehad yes
[1:59:41] look at the next scripture and the lord
[1:59:44] said unto moses uh 12 verse please
[1:59:47] get thee up into this mount of baron
[1:59:51] and see the land which i have given unto
[1:59:53] the children of israel
[1:59:55] and when thou has seen it thou also
[1:59:59] shalt be gathered unto thy people
[2:00:02] as aaron thy brother
[2:00:05] was gathered for ye rebelled against my
[2:00:08] commandment in the desert of sin and the
[2:00:10] strife of the congregation to sit by me
[2:00:11] at the water before their eyes that it
[2:00:13] that is the water of meriban kadesh in
[2:00:15] the wilderness
[2:00:17] of zinn what just happened here
[2:00:21] let's stand what just happened here
[2:00:27] the very last word
[2:00:31] from the lord that come to moses
[2:00:37] concerning the people
[2:00:41] right before he died was to give
[2:00:44] the understanding and revelation of the
[2:00:47] inheritance of the five daughters
[2:00:52] the whole cause right before the death
[2:00:57] of the prophet it finished
[2:01:00] the instruction for the inheritance
[2:01:05] of the five wise daughters of zalapa
[2:01:07] head
[2:01:15] so you see you don't need any new
[2:01:20] instruction it's already been given
[2:01:22] through the angel
[2:01:26] well wait a minute what was the purpose
[2:01:28] of the seventh angel
[2:01:29] [Music]
[2:01:31] the whole purpose of the seventh angel
[2:01:32] was to give the full instruction to the
[2:01:34] wise virgin
[2:01:35] [Music]
[2:01:42] [Music]
[2:01:45] oh i hope you can see that god loves you
[2:01:51] why do you think all these came things
[2:01:52] come down at the end of the message
[2:01:54] all these wonderful revelations about
[2:01:55] the trail of the serpent about the seals
[2:01:58] and all these things are coming down
[2:01:59] what to justification the fact you never
[2:02:01] did it in the first place
[2:02:04] and everything's just saying believe
[2:02:06] just believe it
[2:02:07] believe what he's done and believe that

[2:03:07] wisdom to follow the commandments wisdom
[2:03:09] to discern between right and wrong
[2:03:11] yes sir so here's the thing
[2:03:15] if you've been given wisdom could you
