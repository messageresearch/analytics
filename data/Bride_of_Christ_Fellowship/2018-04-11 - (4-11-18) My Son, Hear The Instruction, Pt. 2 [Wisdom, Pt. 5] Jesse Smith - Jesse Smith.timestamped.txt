[0:20] [Music]
[2:34] let's have a time of Prayer here by
[2:36] God's grace we had a little traffic on
[2:40] the way here so got here later than we
[2:42] wanted to get here
[2:44] but anyways are there any prayer
[2:47] requests for tonight I don't have any
[2:49] written down does anybody have any Haven
[2:52] Amen honey
[2:53] praise the Lord any other requests
[3:01] tonight Haven another one okay I
[3:04] remember our two friends honey that's a
[3:07] good request okay well let's just then
[3:13] pray for a safe travel for brother Troy
[3:15] who's coming in Friday night he's
[3:16] supposed to land at about 11:20 on
[3:19] Friday night so let's pray for brother
[3:21] Troy I do have three announcements here
[3:29] remember we have service Friday night
[3:31] I'm sorry Saturday night at 5 p.m.
[3:33] forgive me Saturday at 5 p.m. with
[3:36] brother Troy and then just one service
[3:39] on Sunday 11 a.m. with brother Troy I'll
[3:42] be taking him to the airport after first
[3:44] service because I think he has an early
[3:45] flight in the afternoon if not then
[3:48] he'll eat with us and then fly out I'd
[3:51] like to have communion but not this
[3:52] weekend but let's do it next weekend the
[3:54] 22nd of April and we'll have two
[3:57] services but I promise to keep it short
[3:59] so we can have communion in the in the
[4:01] evening so April 22nd also now to email
[4:04] everybody I just been feeling led to
[4:06] have communion so let's do that April
[4:08] 22nd let's do a p.m. service and then
[4:12] have communion that day the Lord's
[4:15] Supper one more announcement I shared
[4:18] this with brother Adam there's been two
[4:20] Canadians who have been going around to
[4:22] message churches interrupting their
[4:24] services and last week they
[4:29] were in southern Ohio and West Virginia
[4:32] if I'm not mistaken so I'm sorry no
[4:34] Albion Albion so they were up a brother
[4:37] Jim's church last Sunday night and they
[4:39] tried to interrupt the service and so
[4:42] they got removed from the service so I
[4:45] told brother Adam if they walk in well
[4:48] if they walk in while we're having
[4:50] service
[4:51] I guess we'll let them sit down but if
[4:53] they start interrupting it then I'll
[4:55] stop service and Adam and I will make
[4:57] sure they leave if they don't leave
[4:59] we'll call 911
[5:01] their main thing is they're trying to
[5:03] cause division with worship and they're
[5:06] saying if we're singing any song that
[5:07] was written in the last few years it's
[5:10] satanic and so we're off the word and
[5:13] they've been really causing a lot of
[5:16] division they went to brother cams
[5:17] church and said some really awful things
[5:20] to brother cam and his family and like I
[5:23] said they were trying to interrupt the
[5:24] service last Sunday night in Albion up
[5:27] there brother Jim's Church so Jim called
[5:29] me on Monday and let me know about it he
[5:31] said just be prepared if they come by I
[5:33] don't know if they'll come by tonight I
[5:35] don't know if though I don't even know
[5:36] if they'll come to our church because
[5:37] we're so small but they've already visit
[5:40] our church once last year when brother
[5:42] Brian Hawkins preached in we were still
[5:44] having service in the other room
[5:46] Brian Hawkins preached on the Sunday
[5:48] night and they came to the service but
[5:50] Brian said they just left right
[5:51] afterwards they didn't say anything
[5:53] about the music so they've already been
[5:55] to our church one time I don't know if
[5:57] they'll come back again but since they
[5:59] were in the area at albi and I just
[6:01] thought I let Adam know I'll let you
[6:03] know so if I'm preaching and all of a
[6:06] sudden you hear me stop and say brothers
[6:08] you know are you the brothers that are
[6:10] causing division then Adam and I will
[6:13] try to talk to them we'll try to ask
[6:15] them to go out in the hallway we don't
[6:17] want to argue but we've got to ask them
[6:19] to move and then we ask them to leave if
[6:21] they want to debate about music cuz
[6:23] we're not here to debate tonight this is
[6:25] not a debate night and then if they
[6:29] don't we'd have to call the cops so and
[6:33] brother Adam has had a good point on the
[6:34] text he said brother Branham never did
[6:36] that and the brother Graham never would
[6:37] never support that in fact brother
[6:38] Graham tried to stay away from debates
[6:40] but if anybody wants to debate
[6:43] follow rules we could have one of those
[6:44] but it wouldn't be a service and there
[6:46] have to be rules and you know act like
[6:49] gentlemen and follow Christian standards
[6:51] and so forth like that but I just want
[6:53] to let you know if that happens so last
[6:56] last week when they were in I'm sorry
[6:59] two weeks ago when they were in
[7:00] Tennessee the pastors both called the
[7:04] cops and the cops escorted them off the
[7:06] grounds because they were causing such
[7:09] division and we actually actually can
[7:11] pray for those brothers tonight that'd
[7:12] be good that they'll get that spirit off
[7:14] them by God's grace are they worse
[7:16] telling people going in in the parking
[7:19] lot they were seeing sisters with you
[7:20] know two skirts that weren't all the way
[7:22] down to their feet and they were
[7:23] condemning them saying they were lost
[7:25] and it was just a real awful mess so we
[7:29] can just pray that there are two
[7:30] brothers from Canada I have their
[7:32] license plate and their vehicle so if
[7:34] you see a blue Ford Escape out in the
[7:38] parking lot and two brothers coming in
[7:40] we'll know who they are you know we'll
[7:42] ask them to leave or if they walk in
[7:45] here was some be quiet if they interrupt
[7:47] it then we'll have to have to remove
[7:49] them so that's an odd announcement
[7:53] usually don't have announcements like
[7:54] that to it that's part of the fanaticism
[7:58] I imagine that follows the message and
[8:00] we're thankful that God has given us
[8:03] truth in this hour okay so any other
[8:05] requests is at it so we have havens
[8:07] unspoken our two friends we keep praying
[8:09] for traveling mercies for the Troy and
[8:11] then the two brothers from Canada we'll
[8:13] pray to God will have mercy on them okay
[8:16] all right let's take those before the
[8:18] Lord here

[39:20] looking at a little series on wisdom and
[39:23] we like to go a little bit further with
[39:25] that tonight I want to go back to that
[39:27] thought on my son here the instruction
[39:29] so we're gonna read proverbs chapter 1
[39:31] verse 8 by the grace of the Lord
[39:36] proverbs chapter 1 verse 8 let's all
[39:43] read it
[39:44] together three two on three one two
[39:46] three my son here the instruction of thy
[39:50] father and forsake not the law of thy
[39:53] mother amen let's just have a word of
[39:55] Prayer let's just bow our heads if you
[39:56] ever need on your heart just make it
[39:58] known unto God here in God's presence
[40:00] Heavenly Father we come humbly yet
[40:02] boldly before the throne of grace Lord
[40:04] we realize we're nothing we realize we
[40:06] have no ability no merit of our own or
[40:10] we live by the merits of the blood of
[40:13] your son Jesus Christ we thank you for
[40:15] that blood that was shed oh the blood of
[40:17] Jesus that washes us white as snow Lord
[40:21] we're so grateful Lord God you've saved
[40:23] us by grace and now Lord that we're
[40:25] saved by grace we want to do works for
[40:28] you we want to express our faith Lord
[40:29] and do something for you Lord God bless
[40:32] us here tonight with your presence Lord
[40:34] speak to every heart dear God we just
[40:37] pray you'd have your way bless the
[40:38] visitors Lord God and thank you for safe
[40:41] travel for our brother William Lord and
[40:42] he can be with his grandchildren as his
[40:45] daughter and the family Lord we're so
[40:46] grateful for that Shirley you're a God
[40:49] of grace and mercy Lord so we give you
[40:50] praise and honor and glory in your house
[40:53] here Lord and blessed brother there and
[40:55] he's traveled so far and on the other
[40:56] saints that oppressed our way out to the
[40:58] house of God ministered to them by the
[41:00] Holy Spirit those live streaming as well
[41:02] we give you glory tonight in Jesus
[41:04] Christ's name and the church said Amen
[41:07] god bless yous bein seated praise the
[41:08] Lord so we want to look at this here
[41:12] tonight by God's grace we look at this
[41:15] thought on my son here the instruction
[41:19] so we got our wisdom series here I
[41:21] believe this is part 5 of this series
[41:23] and we just want to focus on all these
[41:26] times that Solomon by the Holy Spirit
[41:30] spoke directly to his son now it was
[41:33] probably ray of balm but it could have
[41:36] been just you know general to another
[41:38] son and of course we know also this
[41:41] applies not just to sons but also
[41:43] daughters because we know the wisdom is
[41:45] good for boys as well as for girls and
[41:48] if anybody ought to be interested in
[41:50] wisdom it ought to be the wise virgins
[41:52] of the message praise the Lord
[41:54] so we ought to have a great interest in
[41:56] the book of Proverbs
[41:58] and we ought to see the proverbs lived
[42:00] out in our daily lives if anybody should
[42:02] be wise if anybody should be walking in
[42:05] the commands of God and and be able to
[42:07] discern between the right path and the
[42:09] wrong path or a wise path and a foolish
[42:11] path it ought to be the wise virgins
[42:13] those who have their lamps trimmed and
[42:15] who have plenty of oil for the wedding
[42:18] procession praise God
[42:19] so we read our text here in proverbs 1
[42:21] verse 8 now remember the message and
[42:24] purpose of Proverbs the youth so the
[42:27] young people are repeatedly admonished
[42:30] to pursue wisdom rather than foolishness
[42:34] you know Solomon is the author and he's
[42:37] just speaking to the young people to
[42:39] hear wisdom hear the word of God stay
[42:42] true to God's Word it's it's a direct
[42:44] message to the young people and so the
[42:47] youth should seek to become teachable
[42:49] rather than mockers scorners doubters
[42:53] sin lovers gang members they should seek
[42:57] to become like Christ amen and as we saw
[43:01] a few weeks ago there's 23 times that
[43:04] Solomon says my son and so we got about
[43:07] halfway through so I think tonight maybe
[43:09] we'll finish if the Lord's willing but I
[43:11] just thought as I read the book it was
[43:13] so striking he just he just kept saying
[43:15] my son my son and I thought my if the
[43:18] Holy Spirit wanted us to hear that and
[43:21] wanted them to hear that in the days of
[43:23] Solomon 3,000 years ago how much more
[43:26] does he want us to hear today amen to
[43:29] speak to our sons and our daughters that
[43:32] they should have the wisdom of the Holy
[43:33] Spirit and he remember he said hear ye
[43:37] children so he speaks to just all
[43:39] children four times and I think we
[43:41] covered all four of those if I'm not
[43:43] mistaken and member this is written from
[43:46] Solomon to his son at the very height of
[43:49] his wisdom mber proverbs was written at
[43:51] the height of his wisdom before he fell
[43:53] to all those wives and the idols that we
[43:56] looked at because he wrote Ecclesiastes
[43:59] at the very end of his life remember in
[44:00] Ecclesiastes he said I tried wisdom you
[44:03] know worldly wisdom
[44:04] I tried women I tried wine all these w's
[44:06] there's a list of like five W's and
[44:09] wisdom wine women he said I've tried all
[44:12] these
[44:12] and their vanity see because he had
[44:15] fallen he fell from the wisdom and he
[44:17] was his heart was more given to his
[44:19] wives than to the word amen
[44:22] and so it teaches us life can seem like
[44:25] vanity when you're not in the perfect
[44:27] will of God but when you're in the
[44:29] perfect will of God life is a joy life
[44:32] is happy life is righteous because the
[44:35] blessing of God rests upon your life
[44:37] amen it's exactly right and so this is
[44:41] written at their very height when he's
[44:42] closest to God we'd say when he's
[44:45] obeying God when he fears the Lord it's
[44:48] not when he's walking you know
[44:50] worshiping idols and and building a
[44:52] temples to idols to Molech and and baya
[44:56] Bale and all these other gods that he
[44:58] worship asked her often that was
[45:01] Ecclesiastes but this is where the Holy
[45:03] Spirit has really got ahold of his heart
[45:06] amen and he's walking the commands now
[45:09] let's review part 1 we looked at this we
[45:11] we saw that Solomon told his sons to do
[45:14] these things so our sons tonight we got
[45:16] malachite Elijah for our sons here
[45:18] tonight but it's - also our daughters
[45:21] amen
[45:21] so sons and daughters you need to do
[45:24] this you need to hear or obey the Word
[45:26] of God and sons and daughters you need
[45:30] to cry out and seek the fear of the Lord
[45:33] that's in chapter 2 you got to cry out
[45:36] and seek and ask God for wisdom for the
[45:39] fear of the Lord and then you've also
[45:42] got to accept God's chastening you got
[45:45] to learn that God is going to rebuke you
[45:48] sometimes God is going to spank you
[45:50] sometimes God is going to chasing you
[45:53] sometimes but you've got to get used to
[45:56] that because he only does it as a loving
[45:58] father he wouldn't chasing you or punish
[46:01] you or he wouldn't try you or allow you
[46:03] to be tried unless there was some good
[46:06] reason for it because he's perfect and
[46:10] in part one we saw we were to avoid evil
[46:14] company gangs of men that want to go be
[46:18] violent and kill people for a quick
[46:20] riches right we saw that in chapter one
[46:23] violent greedy men
[46:25] don't hang around people that are greedy
[46:27] and violent and then he warns stay away
[46:30] from strange women so you have to have
[46:32] your relationships in order your your
[46:34] marriage relationship your friends
[46:36] they've got to be god-pleasing
[46:38] relationships if you're gonna walk in
[46:40] wisdom because well as both Graham said
[46:43] the old proverb birds of a feather flock
[46:45] together amen now remember in part 1
[46:49] also there were so many rewards children
[46:51] if you keep the Word of God honey want
[46:54] the rewards of God the greatest reward
[46:58] is eternal life
[46:59] proverbs called it the Tree of Life also
[47:03] most likely you're going to have a
[47:05] longer life if you serve the Lord you'll
[47:08] also have favor with God and with men
[47:11] and if you tithe and give offerings then
[47:15] your barns will be filled praise the
[47:17] Lord you'll have a life of pleasantness
[47:20] the Bible says you'll have a life of
[47:23] peace you will have deliverance from
[47:25] evil men and evil women if you choose
[47:28] the wise life I have pleasantness twice
[47:31] ok I didn't mean that you'll have health
[47:33] if you choose the the wise path you'll
[47:36] have good doctrine if you choose the
[47:38] wise path and the Bible says you'll have
[47:41] happiness if you choose the wisdom of
[47:42] the Lord amen I couldn't think of any
[47:45] better benefits than that praise the
[47:48] Lord and that's what we're grateful for
[47:50] so let's look at part 2 tonight now
[47:52] we'll start looking at new scriptures so
[47:53] get your Bibles right let's go to
[47:55] chapter 4 proverbs chapter 4 let's just
[47:57] take these my sons statements right out
[48:01] of the Bible here I was just inspired
[48:03] you know as I read through the Book of
[48:05] Proverbs I was just inspired to see my
[48:07] son my son and I believe it's something
[48:10] that we all can learn from don't you
[48:12] agree
[48:13] now so we start with verse 20 so in
[48:16] verse 20 through 27 Solomon gives his
[48:19] ninth this is the ninth time he says my
[48:23] son we've already gone through eight of
[48:24] them then because this is the ninth time
[48:26] the ninth out of 23
[48:28] so proverbs 4 verse 20 let's look at
[48:33] that here now
[48:36] 20 says my son attend to my words
[48:41] incline your ear unto my say no incline
[48:44] of course we that means we got to humble
[48:46] ourselves and listen right got to
[48:49] incline your ear got a humble and listen
[48:52] let them not depart from nine eyes keep
[48:56] them in the mitts of thine heart for
[49:00] their life unto those that find them and
[49:03] health to all their flesh so here we
[49:05] have another promise that God will keep
[49:08] your body healthy if you keep the word
[49:10] of the Lord
[49:11] divine healing is a blessing or a favor
[49:15] or a reward to all those who walk in the
[49:18] ways of God that's right look at verse
[49:23] I'm sorry I want to make this statement
[49:25] right here remember your eyes and your
[49:28] heart are connected how we know that
[49:30] whatever we let in our eyes it has to
[49:33] impact our heart right so if we see good
[49:38] things our heart will be in a good
[49:39] condition if we see evil things our
[49:43] heart will be in an evil condition right
[49:46] so that's what the Bible says let's now
[49:49] keep your place there I'm gonna go to
[49:51] lamentations 351 the Bible teaches us
[49:55] plainly that whatever we see impacts our
[49:59] heart and so Solomon tells his son keep
[50:03] York my commands before your eyes so
[50:06] that means the children are going to
[50:07] read the Word of God right we've got to
[50:11] keep the children with their eyes on the
[50:13] word less video time and more time on
[50:15] the Word of God right because the eyes
[50:18] are going to affect the heart okay so it
[50:22] goes live lamentations 351 here let's
[50:28] read that by the grace of the Lord now
[50:34] this of course this is Jeremiah we know
[50:36] that lamentations 351 it says mine I
[50:40] effective mine heart because of all the
[50:45] daughters of my city so Jeremiah is he's
[50:49] lamenting for the destruction coming on
[50:51] Israel and he's seeing all the daughters
[50:54] being being violently a beaten and and
[50:58] carried away and taken captive and he's
[51:01] seeing all the young girls you know
[51:02] being taken captive and what he sees
[51:05] impacts his heart right and so what we
[51:10] see will impact our heart if we choose
[51:12] to see just jokes jokes jokes all the
[51:14] time we're not going to be in a sober
[51:16] attitude like we ought to be praise the
[51:20] Lord
[51:20] we'll just be a big Joker that day we
[51:24] don't want to be a Joker we want to be
[51:26] someone who can feel what the Holy
[51:28] Spirit wants us to feel that day but see
[51:32] in this case his eyes affected his heart
[51:35] now you know this when I preach this all
[51:36] the time second Peter 2 7 and 8 that's
[51:39] the story of lot and the Bible said lot
[51:42] daily saw things he saw and heard the
[51:46] evils of Sodom and it vexed his heart it
[51:50] tormented him so he would see
[51:52] homosexuals you know on the streets he
[51:56] would see violent gangs you know doing
[51:58] gang activities gang violence and it vet
[52:01] it tormented him everything that he saw
[52:05] it torment in his heart and God saved
[52:08] him because he was a righteous man amen
[52:11] and so we must expect that too if we
[52:14] watch you know violent news reports all
[52:17] the time that's going to affect us the
[52:18] wrong way yeah we have to know a little
[52:21] bit about the news but we should be more
[52:23] interested in God's news than the
[52:26] world's news because his news is always
[52:28] good news amen
[52:30] although it may be a trial it's still
[52:32] good news because all things work
[52:33] together for the good to them that love
[52:35] the Lord so see we've got to keep the
[52:40] commands of God in front of the eyes of
[52:43] the children they've got to be more
[52:45] readers than they are viewers
[52:48] is that right Church that true
[52:50] absolutely you know this is a video
[52:55] generation you know and everybody wants
[52:58] to just do video video video all the
[53:00] time but the best way to learn is to
[53:02] learn through reading reading and
[53:05] writing because it takes all your focus
[53:07] right when you watch a video you can do
[53:10] other things you know you you know we
[53:12] get people get used to that but when you
[53:14] sit down with the book with the Word of
[53:17] God and you focus on that word there's
[53:20] no other apps that can open up while
[53:21] you're reading your Bible there's no
[53:24] notifications that are going to drop
[53:25] down from the top of the Bible and say
[53:27] oh you better call so and so oh you
[53:29] better get supper ready it's just God's
[53:33] Word and now the Holy Spirit's got you
[53:36] alone and now there's a chance you can
[53:39] hear from the Holy Spirit that's the
[53:42] first command to young men my son so
[53:45] there's my son my son keep the Word of
[53:47] God in front of your eyes
[53:49] keep the Word of God in front of your
[53:51] eyes look at verse 23 this is beautiful
[53:53] look at us keep thy heart with all
[53:58] diligence for out of it are the issues
[54:03] of life now look at the word keep in the
[54:08] Hebrew the word keep means to put in
[54:10] jail or prison or a guardhouse didn't
[54:15] brother Adam preach a message called
[54:16] Paul a prisoner of Christ the Bible said
[54:21] keep your heart with all diligence other
[54:24] words keep your heart locked up in a
[54:26] prison with all your efforts don't let
[54:30] your heart wander out and desire other
[54:33] things keep it locked up keep it focused
[54:35] on the Word of God only with all
[54:39] diligence we should put all of our
[54:41] effort into keeping our heart just
[54:44] solely connected and solely interested
[54:46] in Jesus and His Word that's what the
[54:50] word keep means recently we were using
[54:52] at the middle school at Copley we were
[54:54] using the scripture for dating you know
[54:57] because they all start to date when
[54:58] they're in fifth and sixth grade
[55:00] and so we use this scripture
[55:01] I thought was very powerful you can't
[55:04] you know those and these kids aren't in
[55:06] the message or anything but we're trying
[55:08] to teach them true Bible doctrine and
[55:10] they've got to know you can't start
[55:12] dating it you can't start liking girls
[55:14] and you can't start liking boys you've
[55:17] got to put your heart you got to put
[55:19] your emotions in a prison until the
[55:21] right time don't give your heart away
[55:24] too early don't get infatuated fall in
[55:27] love with Christ amen
[55:29] don't give your heart away and don't be
[55:31] distracted because out of the heart flow
[55:34] the issues of life praise the Lord
[55:39] now so we need to remember we got to be
[55:42] a prisoner to Christ and not our phones
[55:45] amen not our jobs necessarily we've got
[55:50] to work but we can't be a prisoner to
[55:52] that we've got to be a prisoner to
[55:54] Christ the Spirit amen
[55:57] the rivers 24 put away from the afore
[56:00] word mouth this is still the same
[56:04] context he's speaking to my son and
[56:07] perverse lips put far from thee look at
[56:13] this verse 25 let thine eyes look right
[56:16] on and let thine eyelids look straight
[56:18] before thee so look the straight and
[56:20] narrow way today focus on the narrow way
[56:24] I love verse 26 it's beautiful this is a
[56:27] great thought for everybody here tonight
[56:29] ponder the the path of thy feet and let
[56:34] all thy ways be established turn not to
[56:38] the right hand nor to the left remove
[56:41] thy foot from evil I thought this was
[56:44] just such a good a good thought for all
[56:46] of us you know we ought to do this every
[56:49] service we ought to just you know before
[56:51] service you ought to sit maybe with your
[56:53] your your your face in your hands and
[56:55] just have some time with the Lord there
[56:57] and think about what direction is my
[57:00] life going ponder ponder the path of
[57:05] your feet what ways you know we ought to
[57:09] be able to do that say Lord am i walking
[57:11] in the ways of God this week have I had
[57:13] a good week where I've
[57:14] walking in your path or have I stepped
[57:16] out of the past some way that's though
[57:20] that's the trouble today we get so busy
[57:22] with the world weather Ram said nervous
[57:25] tensions and Laodicea right the
[57:28] pressures of riches the nervous tensions
[57:30] soft living all these spirits we got a
[57:34] battle we get so caught up in that we
[57:36] forget to ponder our steps and really
[57:39] think about what kind of life am i
[57:40] living but wisdom will tell you slow
[57:45] down and look at the path that you're
[57:47] walking in wouldn't that be good for our
[57:50] children they can see what how am i
[57:52] walking in my Christian walk in our home
[57:56] how am i am i am i stay are my eyes on
[58:00] the narrow path or if I got my eyes
[58:02] officer does something look more
[58:04] enticing or or more valuable than the
[58:07] Word of God it's so important to stop
[58:10] meditate and ponder your pass that
[58:14] you're walking in can you say amen to
[58:16] that
[58:18] many times we know we don't slow down
[58:20] that's why it's good to pray before
[58:21] service that's why it's good to pray
[58:24] after service spend some time stopping
[58:27] what you're doing and pondering where am
[58:30] I actually going with my life
[58:32] where are my feet walking I think the
[58:37] enemy wants us to not ponder our ways he
[58:41] wants to just get us so busy we're just
[58:43] getting well I'll just do my regular
[58:44] habits I'll just do what I always do we
[58:47] need to do what God wants us to do
[58:49] praise the Lord now go to chapter 5
[58:52] let's look at it now look at this is the
[58:53] tenth time the tenth time Salman says my
[58:57] son let's go to verse one proverbs
[59:03] chapter five and this is important
[59:08] of us member not just it's for the young
[59:10] people of course but this is important
[59:12] for all of us to see proverbs 5 verse 1
[59:15] through 6 this is another portion of
[59:18] scripture where he's talking to my son
[59:23] verse 1 my son attend unto my wisdom and
[59:27] bow thine heart to my understanding that
[59:31] thou mayest regard discretion and that
[59:37] thy lips may keep knowledge now let's
[59:42] just stop right there so we want our
[59:44] children to have discretion which is
[59:46] caution we want them to be cautious so
[59:49] before they make a decision we want them
[59:52] to consider is this the right decision
[59:54] right and I want I want my son and I
[59:58] know you want your son and your
[59:59] daughters to listen to you and and and
[1:00:04] regard your teaching the Bible said he
[1:00:07] says bow you're in other words I want my
[1:00:10] son to act like me I want my son to have
[1:00:13] my understanding of how to live my life
[1:00:16] like I love in the morning I'm not
[1:00:18] bragging anything but you know hard as
[1:00:19] adults I love in the morning when I'm up
[1:00:21] I'm praying on my knees and my children
[1:00:23] walk in because I want them to see what
[1:00:26] my life looks like when they're not
[1:00:28] around right I kind of enjoy that when
[1:00:33] they walk in the prayer closet and they
[1:00:34] don't know I'm in there I want them to
[1:00:38] have my understanding I don't want them
[1:00:41] to follow some other man or some other
[1:00:43] person I want them to have my
[1:00:44] understanding and follow the law of
[1:00:47] their mother right that's the word of
[1:00:50] the Lord that's what the scripture says
[1:00:51] and you always know what kind of
[1:00:55] knowledge your children have by what
[1:00:57] comes out of their mouth because the
[1:01:00] Bible says there let their lips keep
[1:01:03] knowledge so we need to make our
[1:01:06] children and teach them to memorize the
[1:01:09] scripture and say it out loud humph
[1:01:12] adults want to say out loud the Word of
[1:01:13] God as well see we got to be careful
[1:01:17] well just children need to say the Word
[1:01:19] of God
[1:01:20] we're the ones who have to create the
[1:01:21] atmosphere
[1:01:22] right it's up to us we've got to speak
[1:01:25] the word we've got to keep the knowledge
[1:01:27] and we've got to make sure their lips
[1:01:29] speak the Word of God because now he's
[1:01:33] now he goes into verse verse three look
[1:01:36] at verse three he says your lips seem to
[1:01:40] keep knowledge but in verse three he
[1:01:41] sews the other side somebody else is
[1:01:44] going to have lips two it's going to be
[1:01:45] the strange woman for the lips of a
[1:01:48] strange woman dropped as a honeycomb and
[1:01:51] her mouth is smoother than oil but her n
[1:01:56] is bitter as wormwood sharp as a
[1:01:58] two-edged sword her feet go down to
[1:02:03] death her steps take hold on hell lest
[1:02:09] thou shouldest ponder the path of life
[1:02:11] her ways are movable that they now cants
[1:02:15] not know them now later on if we get
[1:02:18] there tonight the Bible says the Word of
[1:02:21] God is like honey can you say amen to
[1:02:24] that
[1:02:24] well here it says here a strange lips of
[1:02:29] a woman are like a honeycomb - you see
[1:02:33] see how slick Satan is see how
[1:02:36] attractive sin is sin is pleasurable for
[1:02:40] a season sin is not as good as the Word
[1:02:43] of God but to your flesh if you're not
[1:02:46] careful if you don't silence the voice
[1:02:48] of a tempter it can sound as sweet as
[1:02:53] honey but we must remember the true
[1:02:57] honey the true sweetness is the word of
[1:03:00] the Lord
[1:03:01] nothing will be sweeter for your soul
[1:03:04] than the Word of God but look how the
[1:03:07] cow look how deceptive Satan is he can
[1:03:13] get a woman or a man for the sisters you
[1:03:16] can get a young man Satan can anoint
[1:03:18] that young man they're trying to take
[1:03:19] the virtue from our sisters are the
[1:03:21] young girls or are our older ladies you
[1:03:24] know in adultery or something like that
[1:03:26] Satan can so annoying that it'll sound
[1:03:28] so good in my it might even feel so good
[1:03:31] but it will take them down to the depths
[1:03:34] of hell that's exact
[1:03:36] right and so as a father Solomon he
[1:03:40] warns his son be careful of a
[1:03:42] smooth-talking woman be careful of a
[1:03:46] smooth-talking man when they talk
[1:03:49] outside of the word of God so what would
[1:03:52] Solomon warned his son in this passage
[1:03:54] passage he would warn him about a
[1:03:56] strange woman who can talk real sweet
[1:03:59] just because somebody talks smoother
[1:04:01] than oil and sweet as a honey don't
[1:04:04] believe them examine it by the Word of
[1:04:06] God that's right because her steps take
[1:04:11] a hold on hell is that right that's
[1:04:15] exactly right now look at verse 7 now
[1:04:19] verse 7 he addresses the children 5
[1:04:22] verse 7 so now so he spoke to his son
[1:04:25] verse 1 through 6 and now he starts
[1:04:28] speaking to all the children verse 7 to
[1:04:29] 14 hear me now therefore o ye children
[1:04:34] and depart not from the words of my
[1:04:36] mouth remove thy way far from her so now
[1:04:38] he keeps going back to this woman and
[1:04:41] come not nod to the door of her house
[1:04:43] now we can type this as denominations
[1:04:45] denominations right are like women and
[1:04:48] they can preach so smooth all they talk
[1:04:50] about is the love of Jesus all they talk
[1:04:52] about you know is how much Jesus loves
[1:04:55] all them but when they justify
[1:04:57] wickedness when they say it's okay
[1:04:59] sisters to cut your hair now they've
[1:05:02] entered into an abomination for it's an
[1:05:04] abomination to justify righteousness is
[1:05:08] that right it's Obama I'm sorry
[1:05:10] abomination to justify wickedness
[1:05:12] forgive me when they say it's okay to
[1:05:15] cut your hair it's it's okay or to go to
[1:05:18] movie shows and it's okay to listen to
[1:05:21] worldly music and all these things what
[1:05:23] they've done is they've made a deceptive
[1:05:26] religion right that's Satan's religion
[1:05:29] Satan's Eden and it's smoother than oil
[1:05:32] oh we're all brothers and sisters oh
[1:05:34] we're all going to heaven well we don't
[1:05:36] know that right but we know those whose
[1:05:39] names are on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:05:41] we'll keep all the Word of God that's
[1:05:44] how you know that's how you know whose
[1:05:47] names are on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:05:48] those who keep the word of the
[1:05:50] it's exactly right so Salman now warns
[1:05:54] all the children be careful of the
[1:05:56] strange woman or the strange man of
[1:05:59] course for the sisters don't come to the
[1:06:03] door of their house lest thou give thine
[1:06:05] honor verse 9 unto others and thy years
[1:06:08] unto the cruel verse 10 less strangers
[1:06:12] be filled with thy wealth and the
[1:06:14] Labour's be in the house of a stranger
[1:06:16] and now mourn at the last when that thy
[1:06:18] flesh and thy body are consumed look at
[1:06:23] verse 11 I think I'm going to 14 yes and
[1:06:26] now mourn at the last and thy flesh and
[1:06:28] their body are consumed Sarver's 12 and
[1:06:29] say how have I hated instruction and my
[1:06:33] heart despised reproof and have not
[1:06:35] obeyed the voice of my teachers nor
[1:06:37] inclined mine ear to them that
[1:06:39] instructed me I was almost in all evil
[1:06:43] in the midst of the congregation and the
[1:06:45] Assembly Amen don't you know that's what
[1:06:49] a lot of people do they'll make one
[1:06:50] decision and based upon that wrong
[1:06:53] decision they'll spend the rest of their
[1:06:55] years in sin you see it a lot with
[1:06:57] marriages you know someone will be
[1:06:59] married and they'll get divorced and as
[1:07:01] soon as they take a second husband or
[1:07:03] wife and they've entered in that
[1:07:05] relationship they're basically ruining
[1:07:07] the rest of their life because
[1:07:10] adulterers and fornicators will not
[1:07:13] inherit the kingdom of God I wonder how
[1:07:16] many adulterers married to three times
[1:07:18] look back and say my I've wasted all
[1:07:21] these years I should have listened to
[1:07:24] the voice of the pastor said stay
[1:07:26] married to that person that first
[1:07:27] husband or wife right that's what the
[1:07:31] scripture says here and they give all
[1:07:34] their energy and strength to a second or
[1:07:36] third or fourth marriage when it should
[1:07:39] have been given to their first spouse
[1:07:41] it's exactly right they give their honor
[1:07:44] they give their years unto the cruel all
[1:07:48] right now let's go
[1:07:51] next section here so the children are
[1:07:53] warned of strange women or we'd say evil
[1:07:56] relationships
[1:07:56] let's go then this is the 11th time he
[1:07:59] says my son verse 15 drink waters out of
[1:08:05] thine own cistern and running wells I'm
[1:08:08] sorry I'm sorry and running waters out
[1:08:10] of thine own well let thy fountains be
[1:08:13] dispersed tar lost my spot abroad and
[1:08:18] rivers of water in the streets let them
[1:08:20] be only thine own and not strangers with
[1:08:24] thee let thy fountain be blessed and
[1:08:26] rejoice with the wife of thy youth let
[1:08:29] her be as the loving hind and pleasant
[1:08:31] row that her breasts satisfy thee at all
[1:08:33] times and be thou ravished always with
[1:08:35] their love and why wilt thou my son see
[1:08:38] speaking to his son be ravished with a
[1:08:42] strange woman and embrace the bosom of a
[1:08:45] stranger so Solomon obviously must have
[1:08:48] seen many men leave their first wife and
[1:08:52] then go take another and something sang
[1:08:55] our wife is just like a well whether you
[1:08:58] drink from that well or that well it's
[1:09:00] still water and he's saying drink from
[1:09:03] your well amen keep your vows stay true
[1:09:08] to your promise to God don't go off to
[1:09:11] another well at just water it's the same
[1:09:13] experience it's still water be happy
[1:09:16] with your water amen hallelujah he's
[1:09:20] telling his son this and now what did
[1:09:22] Solomon do later he took too many wives
[1:09:25] he took too many wells and the church
[1:09:27] said a thousand wells can I say like
[1:09:31] that and brother and David took five
[1:09:34] hundred and by her brother ma'am say
[1:09:36] today and choosing him a bride he said
[1:09:37] still David was a man after the heart of
[1:09:39] God and that was under the Old Covenant
[1:09:42] right in the New Testament it's one man
[1:09:44] one woman right there's only one cause
[1:09:47] where you can put him away and that's
[1:09:48] unconfessed fornication like jesus said
[1:09:53] but see Solomon must have seen this and
[1:09:57] he says my son just keep your own life
[1:10:01] don't go after other women it's just
[1:10:03] another different it's just another well
[1:10:04] it's this
[1:10:05] same thing it's just a different well
[1:10:07] stay true just love your well better
[1:10:10] than others amen that's the word of the
[1:10:15] Lord this is what the Holy Spirit wanted
[1:10:18] a king to tell his next son his son who
[1:10:21] was going to be king next right look at
[1:10:26] verse 21
[1:10:27] yea I'll finish the chapter for the ways
[1:10:30] of manner before the eyes of the Lord
[1:10:31] and he pondereth all of his goings to
[1:10:34] the Lord sits there now he wonders why
[1:10:36] is he doing this now of course he knows
[1:10:38] but the Lord thinks about everybody's
[1:10:40] life right his eyes are on all of our
[1:10:44] steps look at verse 22 his own iniquity
[1:10:47] shall take the wicked himself and he
[1:10:49] shall be holding with the cords of his
[1:10:51] sins so see we you know people get
[1:10:53] tangled up in their own sins right it's
[1:10:58] their own fault
[1:10:59] remember God does not tempt any man he's
[1:11:02] tempted when he's drawn away of his own
[1:11:04] lust and he tangles himself in his own
[1:11:07] sin his own lust right it's his own
[1:11:13] fault if he sin it's his own fault if
[1:11:17] she said it's her own fault they're
[1:11:20] tangled in what they wanted they thought
[1:11:22] it was better than the Word of God so
[1:11:24] God lets him get tangled up in their own
[1:11:26] sin but God is rich in mercy God is
[1:11:29] quick to forgive amen and God loves to
[1:11:32] set the captive free hallelujah amen
[1:11:36] verse 23 he shall die without
[1:11:39] instruction this is the adulterer now
[1:11:41] and in the greatness of his folly he
[1:11:45] shall go astray so this is the wisdom he
[1:11:47] would give he said son love your wife
[1:11:51] only be intoxicated with her love so
[1:11:56] always make sure you just love your wife
[1:11:58] so much and she is the most sweetest
[1:12:01] thing that you have don't let anything
[1:12:03] become sweet other than your wife just
[1:12:06] put all your love and all your affection
[1:12:07] to your wife and the brother said don't
[1:12:11] fall in love with anything else always
[1:12:13] stay just always stay excited about your
[1:12:16] wife praise the Lord
[1:12:18] if not you'll go down the path to hell
[1:12:21] it's just another well that one other
[1:12:23] woman just another well he says be true
[1:12:26] to your well now let's go to chapter 6
[1:12:30] here so in chapter 6 verses 1 3 and 20
[1:12:35] Solomon says my son three more times are
[1:12:38] you enjoying this by God's grace I I
[1:12:40] just thoroughly enjoyed this I want to
[1:12:42] see what would a king say to his son a
[1:12:44] man who had all the power all the
[1:12:47] authority any of us have
[1:12:48] he had beyond any any power or wisdom
[1:12:51] any King had at that time Solomon was
[1:12:54] the greatest king in all the world he
[1:12:56] had there was no limits to his power to
[1:12:59] his authority his relationships what
[1:13:01] would a man like that say to us
[1:13:03] and we get to know it by the grace of
[1:13:05] the Lord verse 1 let's go to chapter 6
[1:13:09] verse 1 alright verse 1 my son if thou
[1:13:18] be surety for thy friend now surety
[1:13:20] means a pledge you made a promise to
[1:13:22] your friend it also means a mortgage so
[1:13:24] I don't know if that means you pay their
[1:13:25] mortgage it means both if you be out
[1:13:29] surety or a pledge to your friend if
[1:13:32] thou has stricken thy hand with a
[1:13:34] stranger so you've heard a stranger now
[1:13:38] are snared with the words of your mouth
[1:13:39] so there's the promise you made a
[1:13:41] promise with your mouth or you've said
[1:13:43] something with your lips now are taken
[1:13:46] with the words of thy mouth do this now
[1:13:48] my son and deliver thyself when thou art
[1:13:50] coming to the hand of thy friend go
[1:13:53] humble yourself and make sure your
[1:13:56] friend so see many times we make
[1:13:59] promises and if we make a promise we
[1:14:02] better keep it this is what a king would
[1:14:05] tell his son don't make promises you
[1:14:08] don't plan to keep that's why Jesus said
[1:14:11] don't swear by the altar don't swear by
[1:14:13] the temple he said let your yes be yes
[1:14:15] and your no be or no but he said if you
[1:14:20] make a promise if you make pledge go to
[1:14:23] your friend and make sure you keep your
[1:14:25] pledge humble yourself right Church
[1:14:28] because really your friend is not going
[1:14:30] to forget they're gonna remember that
[1:14:31] you
[1:14:32] have something is that right humble
[1:14:36] yourself well I'm too tired I don't know
[1:14:39] uh he she mistreated me or he mistreated
[1:14:42] me psalmist said no go humble yourself
[1:14:45] keep your word that's the wisdom a king
[1:14:49] would tell his son amen
[1:14:53] look at verse 4 he says go or give not
[1:14:56] sleep to your eyelids nor slumber to the
[1:14:59] eyelids deliver thyself as a row from
[1:15:02] the hand of the hunter and as a bird
[1:15:04] from the hand of the Fowler so see it's
[1:15:08] better it's better that you keep your
[1:15:10] word then go to sleep because you'll be
[1:15:13] tormented by your promise right and God
[1:15:17] will make sure you keep your word -
[1:15:19] right somehow that person will keep
[1:15:21] asking or or that will just it will
[1:15:24] hover over your spirit you know that you
[1:15:26] haven't kept your word and so he says
[1:15:29] humble yourself go to your friend and
[1:15:31] keep your promise amen
[1:15:37] do we want to raise children that make
[1:15:39] promises they can't keep
[1:15:41] well let's meet up at let's meet about
[1:15:44] the church and pray and then you don't
[1:15:45] come to pray let's meet up and and we'll
[1:15:50] just have we need to talk and we need to
[1:15:52] do some we need to make a little
[1:15:54] transaction and then you don't show up
[1:15:56] you don't keep your word well I promise
[1:15:58] I'll help you out with so-and-so dollars
[1:16:00] and then you the day comes and you don't
[1:16:02] help them out with the dollars what kind
[1:16:03] of person are you
[1:16:05] program said you're no better than your
[1:16:08] word you and I we're no better
[1:16:11] Christians than our word so if we create
[1:16:15] an atmosphere or we create an
[1:16:17] expectation we better follow through
[1:16:19] with that expectation amen hallelujah
[1:16:22] because we're minor we're little
[1:16:24] creators aren't we glory amen keep the
[1:16:29] word keep your word amen he told this to
[1:16:33] his son now so he said
[1:16:38] my son in verse 1 and verse 3 now let's
[1:16:41] go down to verse 20 we'll skip down to
[1:16:42] verse 20 because it looks like he goes
[1:16:44] to his son again yeah proverbs chapter 6
[1:16:47] verse 20 now remember especially for our
[1:16:52] sons here mal kind Elijah this is what a
[1:16:55] king would tell his son my son keep thy
[1:17:01] father's commandment and forsake not the
[1:17:04] law of your mother you see how see how
[1:17:08] mothers got to be a lawgiver at the home
[1:17:11] see how she's got to have a law it's got
[1:17:14] to be right or wrong a mother's got to
[1:17:16] be we have a real backbone that she
[1:17:18] don't compromise because then the
[1:17:21] children will learn to compromise mother
[1:17:24] what mother says mothers got to keep
[1:17:26] that word she's got a law and the church
[1:17:29] said she's the fifth gospel we looked at
[1:17:31] that on Sunday remember that before
[1:17:33] Matthew Mark Luke and John get to the
[1:17:36] child the gospel of mama gets to the
[1:17:39] child and it's got to be a law it's got
[1:17:43] to be right and wrong the children need
[1:17:46] boundaries the children need to know
[1:17:50] this is right this is wrong
[1:17:54] that's right the verse 21 I love this
[1:17:57] bind them continually a Paul 9 heart and
[1:18:00] tie them about thy neck amen
[1:18:04] glory just always remember what mom said
[1:18:09] okay girls look at me children look at
[1:18:10] me always remember what your mama tells
[1:18:13] you never forget it right now KY never
[1:18:17] forget what your mother tells you to do
[1:18:19] keep it around your neck because it'll
[1:18:22] be life to you it'll be health to you
[1:18:25] it'll be long days for you it'll be a
[1:18:28] blessing to you amen
[1:18:34] look at verse 20
[1:18:36] when thou goest it shall lead thee when
[1:18:38] thou sleepest it shall keep thee and
[1:18:42] when I'm sorry and when thou wakest it
[1:18:45] shall talk with thee yep any of the dots
[1:18:50] ever heard the voice of your mom or dad
[1:18:52] in your head I have when I'm scared my
[1:18:56] voice of my mom comes in my head when
[1:18:59] she taught me a second Timothy 1:7 God
[1:19:04] has not given us the spirit of fear but
[1:19:05] of power love and a sound mind
[1:19:08] the voice of my mother still stays with
[1:19:10] me and children that ought to stay with
[1:19:14] you let the voice of your mother the
[1:19:17] voice of your father it will talk to you
[1:19:20] if you're willing to listen to it don't
[1:19:23] forget it don't push it off and say I
[1:19:24] don't listen to that mom or dad I don't
[1:19:26] want listen bind it upon your neck and
[1:19:28] listen to your parents amen glory verse
[1:19:38] 23 for the commandment is a lamp and the
[1:19:43] law is light and reproofs of instruction
[1:19:47] are the way of life amen
[1:19:51] to keep thee from the evil woman look
[1:19:53] when it goes back to this King is really
[1:19:55] concerned about evil women this King is
[1:19:58] really concerned about adultery and
[1:20:00] fornication right he's really concerned
[1:20:06] there's something really destructive
[1:20:08] about a sexual relationship that doesn't
[1:20:10] glorify God it's very destructive this
[1:20:16] so this is the what the fifth time I
[1:20:18] thought I wrote it up there oh this is
[1:20:19] the third warning of an evil woman
[1:20:21] he just keeps bringing it make sure you
[1:20:24] pray before you get married a man
[1:20:26] Loree he just again and again don't be
[1:20:31] involved with strange men don't be
[1:20:33] involved with strange women keep the law
[1:20:35] of God around your neck and the flattery
[1:20:40] of the tongue of a strange woman in
[1:20:42] verse 24 verse 25 especially for the but
[1:20:44] the young men lust not after her beauty
[1:20:47] in thine heart
[1:20:49] neither let her take thee with her
[1:20:51] eyelids see that makeup coming in with
[1:20:53] her eyelids painted eyelids don't let
[1:20:58] her take her take you with her eyelids
[1:21:00] right or the beauty that she pretends to
[1:21:05] have right because it's not true beauty
[1:21:08] it's lust look at this for by means of a
[1:21:13] horse woman a man is brought to a piece
[1:21:15] of bread and the adulteress will hunt
[1:21:18] for the precious life so that evil
[1:21:22] woman's like a predator trying to get
[1:21:24] some prey right trying to hunt and try
[1:21:27] to snatch these young people out of our
[1:21:29] grasp Satan's trying to come through and
[1:21:32] fly down like a predator and snatch up
[1:21:34] our precious children and we've got to
[1:21:37] protect them amen we've got to instill
[1:21:41] wisdom in their heart that they stay
[1:21:44] away from these kind of flattering
[1:21:46] smooth-talking women and men that's the
[1:21:52] word of the Lord
[1:21:53] look at verse 27 can a man take fire in
[1:21:57] his wisdom and his clothes not be burned
[1:22:00] the answer of course is no can a man
[1:22:04] lust in his heart and not be hurt by
[1:22:07] that no it's going to affect him can a
[1:22:11] woman lust over a man and not be
[1:22:14] affected by that no they're gonna fall
[1:22:17] back in their walk with God they're
[1:22:19] gonna fall into their permissive will of
[1:22:21] God but we've got to keep lust out of
[1:22:23] our hearts and stay in the perfect will
[1:22:25] of God if you take sin if you take fire
[1:22:28] in your heart you're gonna be burnt
[1:22:30] right what we need is the Holy Ghost and
[1:22:32] fire in our heart Haven and that'll
[1:22:35] bring out that other evil fiery that
[1:22:38] wild fire amen
[1:22:39] the real consuming fire of God will burn
[1:22:43] out the lusts of the flesh that's right
[1:22:49] can 1 in verse 28 can one go upon hot
[1:22:52] coals and his feet not be burned of
[1:22:54] course not
[1:22:57] so he
[1:22:59] both into his neighbor's wife who summer
[1:23:01] touches her shall not be innocent
[1:23:04] you cannot partake of adultery in the
[1:23:07] physical or in the spiritual and have it
[1:23:10] not impact you it's going to impact you
[1:23:14] you're gonna fall away from where you
[1:23:16] used to be with the Lord
[1:23:18] just like tonight you can't walk out of
[1:23:20] here the same way you're they're gonna
[1:23:22] be rejoicing praise the Lord for the
[1:23:24] word of God or you'll walk out of here
[1:23:26] so I was so boring
[1:23:27] I better go turn on my phone and watch
[1:23:30] something exciting
[1:23:31] I was watching listening to a preacher
[1:23:33] last week and he had a friend who worked
[1:23:36] in the movie business a preacher and so
[1:23:39] his friend was working on the new
[1:23:40] spider-man trailer now I don't watch
[1:23:42] movies and I don't preach it's okay to
[1:23:44] watch spider-man it's not okay but he
[1:23:47] said his friend was working on the new
[1:23:49] part three amazing spider-man movie I
[1:23:52] don't even know if it's out yeah I don't
[1:23:53] know but I was just like this preacher
[1:23:55] so I was listening to what he said and
[1:23:57] he said this preacher his friend invited
[1:24:00] him over and he was at his friend's
[1:24:02] house he said he said hey watch this
[1:24:03] 30-second trailer of the new spider-man
[1:24:05] movie and he said okay you know and he
[1:24:09] kind of compromised a little bit but he
[1:24:12] said he watches 30-minute 30-second
[1:24:14] video and he said within the first five
[1:24:16] seconds his heart rate started going way
[1:24:18] up because of all the action and the
[1:24:23] music and the emotion and he said within
[1:24:26] the first 15 seconds he had such a heart
[1:24:29] rate his all his emotions were we're
[1:24:31] moving you know there's a they show a
[1:24:33] love scene or they you know that they
[1:24:35] show somebody struggling I'm gonna fall
[1:24:37] all this intensity and drama and he said
[1:24:41] by the end of the 30 seconds he was
[1:24:43] almost feeling like he was going to
[1:24:44] sweat because of all the drama and he
[1:24:48] said how deceptive is Satan in 30
[1:24:52] seconds of music and images he can make
[1:24:56] your heart and emotions be so moved to
[1:24:58] the point of happiness or crying or
[1:25:00] Lessie all over a filthy lie I thought
[1:25:06] my that's powerful Satan his words are
[1:25:10] smooth as oil
[1:25:13] his words are sweet as honey to the
[1:25:16] flesh alright right Church and all and
[1:25:21] you got to be careful to you and I maybe
[1:25:24] shouldn't watch trailers and movies
[1:25:25] either amen because we get so excited
[1:25:30] over 30 seconds and at the bottom of it
[1:25:33] all there is no bottom it's the
[1:25:35] bottomless pit it's a lie there never
[1:25:39] was a spider-man but there's a devil man
[1:25:43] right who creeps them out like a spider
[1:25:48] injected with this poison how
[1:25:51] smooth-talking is the devil to get
[1:25:53] people's emotions involved for 30
[1:25:55] seconds and then and then think about we
[1:25:59] come to church and do we do we give God
[1:26:02] do we sing the songs where it really
[1:26:04] gets our motions involved into it we'll
[1:26:08] sing a 3-minute song and have you and I
[1:26:11] felt our emotions have we felt the
[1:26:13] meaning behind that song at the cross at
[1:26:17] the cross where I first saw the light
[1:26:21] do we feel that we ought to feel that
[1:26:26] because that's all in last 4 minutes we
[1:26:29] ought to feel that no I remember when I
[1:26:32] went to the cross the first time amen
[1:26:34] and now I'm walking the light I remember
[1:26:38] when that sin burden rode away and I
[1:26:41] wept and gave God praise I remember that
[1:26:44] and it was such a dramatic event oh I'm
[1:26:47] going to sing with all my heart but see
[1:26:50] people won't put their hearts into it
[1:26:52] they say they're Christians right they
[1:26:55] won't they won't feel it within they'll
[1:26:56] go watch 30 seconds of spider-man or
[1:26:59] Batman or Avengers and get all excited
[1:27:02] about a filthy live from the pits of
[1:27:04] hell oh how we must guard our hearts and
[1:27:10] the church said I thought you might like
[1:27:13] that that really blessed me last week
[1:27:14] I'm like my praise the Lord what a
[1:27:17] lesson that we must learn Satan's lies
[1:27:20] are smooth as oil sweet as a honeycomb
[1:27:24] but it's only for a season
[1:27:26] and it's a deceptive path and the steps
[1:27:29] go down to hell that's exactly right
[1:27:35] my verse 31
[1:27:38] now I'm sorry verse 30 men do not
[1:27:40] despise the thief if he steal to satisfy
[1:27:43] his soul when he's hungry but if he be
[1:27:44] found he shall restore Sevenfold now
[1:27:47] that's verse 30 as sinners because you
[1:27:50] and I despise anybody who breaks the
[1:27:52] Word of God and the church said so that
[1:27:55] sinners all sinner all Christians
[1:27:58] despise anybody who sins not condemning
[1:28:02] them but they just hate sin verse 31 but
[1:28:04] if he be found he shall restore
[1:28:05] Sevenfold he should give all the
[1:28:07] substance of his house but whoso
[1:28:09] committeth adultery with the woman
[1:28:11] lacketh understanding and he that doeth
[1:28:13] it destroyeth his own soul look at that
[1:28:16] that's powerful if someone commits
[1:28:20] physical adultery they are destroying
[1:28:22] their own soul is it do you think it's
[1:28:27] important that Solomon's trying to get
[1:28:28] his son to understand this you think
[1:28:30] it's okay that he talks about this a
[1:28:32] third time or are we getting tired with
[1:28:34] him warning us we shouldn't get tired
[1:28:38] with it because this is a matter of soul
[1:28:41] life or so death this is a matter right
[1:28:47] because there's only two masters you
[1:28:49] can't serve God and the devil you'll
[1:28:51] serve one or the other and we've got to
[1:28:53] choose Christ if not we're destroying
[1:28:57] our own soul by living for the devil
[1:29:00] living for ourselves so Solomon
[1:29:06] repeatedly again and again keeps
[1:29:08] emphasizing this remember adulterers
[1:29:11] will not inherit the kingdom of God and
[1:29:14] brother Branham takes it a step further
[1:29:16] and shows the woman's responsibility he
[1:29:19] said a woman will be as pure as the lily
[1:29:21] physically but when she wears the high
[1:29:24] heels and wears pants and wears tight
[1:29:26] clothes and causes men to lusts he said
[1:29:29] show answer for that on the day of
[1:29:30] judgment and be just as guilty as a
[1:29:34] prostitute why because she has the
[1:29:38] spirit of a prostitute
[1:29:40] she doesn't have the discernment to know
[1:29:42] that my beauty can cause others to lust
[1:29:45] when I display myself out like that the
[1:29:49] Bible said present your bodies a living
[1:29:50] sacrifice for Christ in Romans 12:1 and
[1:29:55] Wool woman that presents herself like
[1:29:57] that with the tight clothes and all
[1:29:58] these things like that
[1:29:59] she's percent presenting herself as a
[1:30:01] harlot is that right and because she
[1:30:05] caused it and didn't repent and knew
[1:30:07] better
[1:30:08] I talked to women and they knew better
[1:30:10] when they were sinners they knew better
[1:30:12] they knew what they were doing when they
[1:30:14] put on those high heels they knew what
[1:30:17] they were doing when they put on the
[1:30:18] tight shirts amen
[1:30:20] they knew what they were doing when they
[1:30:22] put all that makeup on they're trying to
[1:30:25] get attention they're trying to get
[1:30:27] people to look at them and talk with
[1:30:28] them they know what they're doing
[1:30:31] because God placed that understanding in
[1:30:33] their conscience enough to answer for it
[1:30:36] and they've rejected the Holy Spirit so
[1:30:38] many times and say well it's okay
[1:30:40] I'm not I'm not committing the literal
[1:30:42] act I'm not committing the literal act
[1:30:44] and they don't even pick up their Bible
[1:30:46] and read Matthew chapter 5 verse 27
[1:30:48] where Jesus says if a man looks on her
[1:30:50] and lusts after he's guilty and
[1:30:52] committed adultery already in his heart
[1:30:55] or if a preacher preaches that they'll
[1:30:58] walk right over and say well I never
[1:30:59] committed adultery and yet they've got
[1:31:01] that spirit of adultery on them
[1:31:02] that's right church they lacketh
[1:31:06] understanding destroying their own Souls
[1:31:10] give me 10 more minutes here by the
[1:31:12] grace of Lord I don't I don't to wear
[1:31:15] myself a hide the fever yesterday so I'm
[1:31:16] just trying to overcome the fever so
[1:31:18] pray for me I woke up with a fever on
[1:31:20] Tuesday morning and by God's grace I
[1:31:23] feel a little better but I'm still
[1:31:23] feeling a little tired help me Lord now
[1:31:27] verse 33 yeah we'll go to 33 35 yeah a
[1:31:32] wound and dishonor shall he get and his
[1:31:37] reproach shall not be wiped away
[1:31:38] see once somebody commits that act of
[1:31:40] adultery they are dishonored for their
[1:31:43] life right they are wounded for life men
[1:31:48] that cheat on their wives they wound
[1:31:50] their wives for life now the
[1:31:53] and we'll forgive and the men ought to
[1:31:55] repent all these things like that but
[1:31:58] there are wounds that last let me
[1:31:59] understand that the Bible said a broken
[1:32:03] spirit who can bear it's so hard to bear
[1:32:07] that think about even my heart how my
[1:32:09] parents divorced that broke that broke
[1:32:12] my spirit and that still hurts me to
[1:32:14] this day to see my parents walk away
[1:32:17] from each other and leave my dad or see
[1:32:19] my dad leave my mom with six kids all by
[1:32:21] herself
[1:32:22] that still hurts me to this day it just
[1:32:24] hurts me and I think how could that be
[1:32:27] done now of course I love my dad I
[1:32:29] forgive my dad all these things like
[1:32:30] that but it still leaves pain in our
[1:32:33] hearts it scars us but see a man that
[1:32:37] commits adultery the wound and dishonor
[1:32:40] the reproach shall not be wiped away the
[1:32:44] Bible says so see how amazing it is if
[1:32:49] somebody in the New Testament now can
[1:32:51] get forgiveness and then Jesus wipes all
[1:32:54] this in a way right amen like the church
[1:32:58] in Corinth where Paul said you're
[1:32:59] adulterers you're effeminate your lies
[1:33:01] your thieves and such were some of you
[1:33:04] and such were some of me but the blood
[1:33:07] of Jesus and the Spirit of God has
[1:33:09] washed away all of our sins amen
[1:33:11] Lori without the blood of Jesus that
[1:33:15] reproach cannot be wiped away but with
[1:33:18] the blood of Jesus we can have light
[1:33:20] garments pure and white hey man and
[1:33:24] that's the only thing that'll wipe it
[1:33:26] away is the blood of Jesus Christ look
[1:33:31] at verse 34 for jealousy is the rage of
[1:33:34] a man therefore he will not spare in the
[1:33:36] day of vengeance that speaking of
[1:33:38] someone who's been committed adultery
[1:33:40] with somebody else's wife he will not
[1:33:42] regard any ransom neither will he rest
[1:33:45] content though thou give us many gifts
[1:33:47] so this is speaking of the reproach so
[1:33:49] when someone commits adultery not only
[1:33:51] have they hurt their spouse but the
[1:33:53] other person's spouse they destroy their
[1:33:57] own soul
[1:34:03] all right let's go I got about five more
[1:34:05] minutes here some more minutes let's
[1:34:06] just hit a couple more oh I don't know
[1:34:08] if I can get to that one here thank you
[1:34:14] sir
[1:34:14] I appreciate that well yeah let's just
[1:34:18] go to Chapter seven then okay I just
[1:34:20] have to go quickly here because again he
[1:34:22] gives a fourth warning about the evil
[1:34:24] women a fourth warning and then he keeps
[1:34:31] going so Chapter seven has broke up
[1:34:33] there's a warning of a woman and then
[1:34:35] there's a break and then there's a
[1:34:36] warning of women at the end so again
[1:34:40] this must be a really important thing
[1:34:42] and how many parents feel burdened for
[1:34:43] your children to marry the right spouse
[1:34:45] I got six kids I got seven on the way
[1:34:48] and we pray all the time God prepare
[1:34:50] their husbands and wives for them may
[1:34:53] they make the right choice amen
[1:34:57] is that they don't take this seriously
[1:34:59] if they don't take it prayerfully they
[1:35:02] can destroy their own Souls brother Bram
[1:35:05] said you can ruin your entire life on
[1:35:07] the earth now we just read through that
[1:35:08] earlier remember decades of pain and
[1:35:10] decades have heard all these things to
[1:35:13] make the wrong decision I think it was
[1:35:21] one time it's okay honey if I say this
[1:35:23] story I think the girls one time were
[1:35:25] we're saying like Daddy I want to marry
[1:35:26] you did the girls say that one time but
[1:35:28] but you said you can't they can't marry
[1:35:31] daddy but they need to find a man who
[1:35:33] lives like daddy is that right we talked
[1:35:35] about that you know when they're young
[1:35:37] they don't know I thought so my girls
[1:35:39] say daddy could I marry you when I grew
[1:35:40] up I think that has a blessing you know
[1:35:44] like praise the Lord they think I'm a
[1:35:46] good man I'm living for Jesus amen
[1:35:50] but that's what we wanted to be we want
[1:35:54] them to remember that they shouldn't
[1:35:56] even take a man seriously unless he
[1:35:58] asked like unless he acts like their
[1:36:00] daddy Merrick I don't take a woman
[1:36:03] serious unless she acts like your mama
[1:36:06] dad I'm going to have these
[1:36:07] conversations yet with him they're
[1:36:09] really not teenagers except Lydia so I'm
[1:36:11] kind of getting an early start on my my
[1:36:13] father-son talk I'll say like that
[1:36:17] although we've talked about you know
[1:36:19] important things but what I'm saying is
[1:36:21] that this is so critical the Holy Spirit
[1:36:24] keeps coming again and again and again
[1:36:27] humming to be the word of God's inspired
[1:36:28] the Holy Spirit one of this repeated a
[1:36:31] fourth time be careful of strange women
[1:36:35] be careful of a strange man you think
[1:36:38] God was wasting his time with Chapter
[1:36:40] seven
[1:36:40] absolutely not God knew we needed
[1:36:43] Chapter seven just like we needed
[1:36:44] Chapter six
[1:36:46] amen giving us more wisdom more
[1:36:49] understanding of the ways of God let's
[1:36:53] not take it lightly Church for times
[1:36:59] sake let me just go through no yeah
[1:37:04] let's just maybe I'll just read the
[1:37:05] whole chapter here all right my son look

[1:37:25] table of thine heart amen santé wisdom

[1:37:33] understanding thy kinswoman that they
[1:37:37] may keep thee from the what strange
[1:37:39] woman what is going to keep Malachi and
[1:37:43] Elijah from a strange woman the Word of
[1:37:45] God if they let it be written on their
[1:37:50] hearts what kept John and I from a
[1:37:54] strange woman or brother Adam what kept
[1:37:56] us with wrong woman the gracious and
[1:37:58] loving word of God hallelujah that's it
[1:38:03] that's the only weapon we got is the
[1:38:05] Word of God amen

[1:38:09] self-help book on marriage you didn't
[1:38:11] say that

[1:38:22] a gun to protect them give them
[1:38:23] something greater than that the sharp
[1:38:25] double-edged sword of the eternal Word
[1:38:27] of God amen
[1:38:29] that will keep them from a strange woman
[1:38:31] give them the Word of God oh we should
[1:38:34] be so grateful for the word of the Lord
[1:38:41] all right finish let's go to verse 6 for
[1:38:43] anti window of my house I looked through
[1:38:45] a case now this is striking look at this
[1:38:47] story so Solomon one day was looking out
[1:38:50] of his window you guys ever look out
[1:38:51] your window he's looking out of his
[1:38:53] window at the in Jerusalem there and he
[1:38:56] looks out the window and he sees a young
[1:38:58] man walking on the streets and he writes
[1:39:02] down what he saw on the streets let's
[1:39:04] see what he saw he actually witnessed
[1:39:06] this one day in Jerusalem the City of
[1:39:10] God passing through the street near a
[1:39:14] corner I'm sorry two verse seven and
[1:39:16] behold among the simple ones I discerned

[1:42:45] through his liver as a bird haisa to the
[1:42:48] snare knoweth not that it is for his
[1:42:50] life hearken unto me now therefore o ye
[1:42:52] children and attend to the words of our
[1:42:54] mouth lowers listen to me there are
[1:42:56] people that are anointed with the devil
[1:42:59] out there that are trying to hunt your
[1:43:00] soul
[1:43:01] Satan is as a roaring lion seeking whom
[1:43:05] he may devour
[1:43:06] and Satan's doing that through other
[1:43:08] people who are anointed with his spirit
[1:43:12] but children he says my son children
[1:43:15] listen to me let not thine heart decline
[1:43:20] to her ways don't lower yourself to her
[1:43:22] standards keep yourself on the standards
[1:43:25] of God go not astray in her pass for she
[1:43:32] has cast down many wounded yay many
[1:43:35] strong men have been slain by her her
[1:43:39] house is the way to hell going down to
[1:43:42] the chambers of death let's say into our
[1:43:44] feet by God's grace Oh
[1:44:00] true is the word of the Lord it's so
[1:44:04] true
[1:44:06] Psalm was so concerned about this this
[1:44:09] evil relationship a fourth time he
[1:44:12] visits this and he says now I've got an
[1:44:15] eyewitness testimony I've seen it of a
[1:44:18] young man who's off by himself out at
[1:44:21] night in the wrong place
[1:44:23] he thought he was strong enough to
[1:44:25] withstand her but pretty soon he fell
[1:44:27] she caused him to yield and fall see the
[1:44:33] wisdom of God would tell us first of all
[1:44:35] don't go out alone at the wrong time
[1:44:38] right the second thing would tell us
[1:44:41] don't even stop for a second to listen
[1:44:43] to the lie of the devil
[1:44:45] that right Church the the problem was he
[1:44:49] stopped to listen and we can't even stop
[1:44:53] and listen not even one time we must
[1:44:57] stay true to the word of the Lord
[1:45:03] now with this message how many want to
[1:45:05] remain faithful to the Word of God to
[1:45:09] our brothers that are married how many
[1:45:11] want to remain true to your well praise
[1:45:14] the Lord or young people want to remain
[1:45:18] true and stay pure for the word of God's
[1:45:20] sake our young people should win a bind
[1:45:23] the law of their mother and the
[1:45:25] instruction of their father around their
[1:45:27] necks and never forget what their
[1:45:29] parents taught them let's pray for that
[1:45:32] tonight let's pray for all of us that
[1:45:34] our relationships will be strong whether
[1:45:37] we're married or whether we're single we
[1:45:39] would not enter into the wrong
[1:45:41] relationship let's pray for our children
[1:45:43] that they will hear the voices of their
[1:45:46] parents all the day long
[1:45:48] hey man in church I remember when I was
[1:45:51] in high school I was I was in a really
[1:45:54] bad compromising situation an awful
[1:45:57] situation and I was about to do
[1:46:00] something very evil but then the voice
[1:46:02] of my youth youth pastor woman there was
[1:46:05] a woman pastor this shows how important
[1:46:08] it is to have voices that are telling
[1:46:10] you the truth even though she was out of
[1:46:11] position but I
[1:46:14] heard the voice of my youth woman pastor
[1:46:17] in my ear and it kept me from breaking
[1:46:20] God's Word and I can say praise the Lord
[1:46:24] for that was she out of position of
[1:46:27] course but was she trying to get me to
[1:46:30] hear the voice of God yes and like the
[1:46:34] Bible said if you hear and have an open
[1:46:37] heart to the instruction of your parents
[1:46:39] or the preachers that voice will keep
[1:46:41] talking to you all day amen
[1:46:44] what voice is that the voice of the Holy
[1:46:47] Spirit amen
