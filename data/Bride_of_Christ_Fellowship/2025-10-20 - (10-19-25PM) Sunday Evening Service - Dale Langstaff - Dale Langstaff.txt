========================================

Just read uh 1st Samuel 16 verse one also. And I saw a mighty angel Christ come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head. And his feast was as it were the sun and his face was as the sun. Sorry. And his feet were as pillars of fire that came down in our day. Our Lord Jesus. 1st Samuel 16:1. And the Lord said unto Samuel, "How long wil thou mourn Saul's for Saul? Seeing I have rejected him over Israel." Here's God pushing the prophet to move on. How long are you going to mourn the past? move forward. How long are you going to mourn over Saul, seeing I've rejected him, reigning over Israel? Lord Jesus, I pray you'll bless these people. Lord, supernaturally bless these people. Bless this church. Bless Pastor Jesse's family and the ministry. And Lord, I pray you're just, you're already here, but I pray your divine anointing would come and bless your bride tonight. and we'll give you all the praise for all for all of eternity. In your name we pray. Amen. Amen. You may have your seats this morning. Amen. I want to preach on bride's anointing. The bride's anointing. And I want to type it in. Oh. Oh, sorry. Oh, that's right. Yeah. I got a pretty big voice. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Oh. All right. No, no, no. It's all right. No, it's all right. Hey. Yeah. Yeah. No, no. Sorry. I didn't I thought it was somebody banging on the wall or something next door. I'm sorry. I thought they were weightlifting or something. Forgive me, man. I'm sorry. I might be sorry. Amen. Amen. So here we see in 1st Samuel 16:1 that the Lord was asking Samuel. See when God rejected Saul, the prophet had trouble with that because he loved Saul. He loved Saul. And so he was mourning God's decision over Israel. And I I want to show you something. The in the bride's anointing. There's something in the bride that isn't visible maybe yet, but it's there. Looks are deceiving. And I want to show you here. Here, you know, when when God asked Saul, if that might we can change anything, pastor. Just whatever. I'm sorry. Brother Mlen, you know, here we want to type this here. When the Lord comes and to the prophet and ask him these questions, he said, "How long are you going to mourn over these big churches? How long are you going to mourn over the people that are rich? How long are you going to mourn over the handsome and everything that's going on amongst them?" God said to Samuel, "I've rejected them, disobedient to my word. I've got a predestinated elected bride that loves every word that I hang to. I got a I got a bride that has the the my heart. We when I I I I mentioned just a few little things. It's amazing. The anointing was grabbing part of this message this morning. But you know how we come out of God's side and we actually come out of his heart. But David had the heart of God. David had a man that would obey his word. And we see here if we drop to verse seven, and the Lord said unto Samuel, look not at his countenance or his heights. We mentioned this, the stature, because I've refused them. These were David's brothers. For the Lord saith, seeth not by man seeth, but lookth on the outward appearance. But it was the Lord that was looking on the heart. And we see here, here's God talking to the prophet and he said, "You're looking at the wrong thing. &gt;&gt; You're looking at his countenance. &gt;&gt; You're looking at his education. &gt;&gt; You're looking at beauty. &gt;&gt; You're looking at his heights. But I see his heart. I see way past what you're looking at." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And his heart, Saul's heart is far from me. David's brother's heart were far from me. And then if we drop down to verse, and I'm going to go with something with this here. You know, in verse 11 here, Samuel said unto Jesse, David's dad, he said, "Is this all your children?" He said, "There remainth just the youngest, just the little group around the corner. They not they're not affiliated with nobody big." &gt;&gt; And they behold, and he's just keeping a few noisy sheep, them holy rollers. And you know, and Samuel said unto him, "Send forth and fetch them." And here Samuel's asking. He said, "It is it. There's no more real believers. Is this it? You don't have no more kids." &gt;&gt; Jesse said, "Well, just a little sheep boy, the one that's all smelly." I want to show you something that was on David. And and I mentioned that this morning. Forgive me for that. But I want to show you something that was on the bride. There was something on David that his closest family never seen. There's something on you that your closest blood relatives may not see. &gt;&gt; It's the bride's anointing. &gt;&gt; It's election. Watch this. Verse 12. And so they sent and brought David. And now this is what the scripture says about David. He was runy with all and with all of any beauty, countenance, and goodly to look to. And the Lord said, "Rise up and anoint him, for this is my man." I'm sure the prophet there, God's prophet. So he said, "You're sure, God? You &gt;&gt; You're sure this is it? David had nothing that the natural eye could see &gt;&gt; in beauty or countenance, but his anointing. He was God's anointed. See, he had a heart after God. And the bride is God's heart. And she has God's anointing. You see, I I want to just jump down here and show you some things. David was God's anointed, &gt;&gt; but he was running for his life. &gt;&gt; He was anointed the king, but he had no crown. &gt;&gt; He was anointed king, but he had no crown. He had he was a royalty, but he had no robes. He never had a throne, but he he possessed the throne. &gt;&gt; Sounds like the bride. He possessed the throne. He had a kingdom, but he never had a kingdom. You belong to a kingdom. Watch this. How David never had safety. Here he's running from the very people he's supposed to be king over. Hayen rejected the bride. Watch this. Watch how the bride was with David. David's own men. The Jewish people rejected David. And David's own men were Hittites. They were gentile bride because they seen the a potential anointing and they seen what David was going to become. And they knew David would be ruler. wasn't what he was today, &gt;&gt; but his own people couldn't see it. The Hittites seen it. They recognize the coming anointing of King. You know, sometimes people right around us and even in the churches or in the bride might not recognize God's anointing on you. That's so it's so important where when we preach this morning is knowing your position in Christ, knowing where you are. Amen. So we look at verse 13. So Samuel took the horn and he anointed David, his brethren, and the spirit of the Lord fell on David from that day forward. And Samuel rose up and went his way. Samuel anointed God's chosen bride. And the spirit of the Lord came on David. And the spirit of the Lord's came on the bride. &gt;&gt; And it hasn't left us. &gt;&gt; And it never will leave us. &gt;&gt; And he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Don't get too caught up with crowns yet. &gt;&gt; Don't get too caught up with thrones yet. &gt;&gt; Don't change the anointing. watching Samuel or uh Psalms, sorry, Psalms 105:15, saying, "Touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm." I want to I want to break that scripture down a little bit. You know, the anointing is not just ministers. Many times this is pointing to ministers, and that is true, but the anointed is anybody with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; If you would offend one of the least of these, Huh? &gt;&gt; You have offended me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Touch not my anointed. Be very careful. Remember when you're speaking to your brother and sister that you're speaking to God. &gt;&gt; I wonder how that would change different things, disagreements. Huh? See, you know what the prophet said this. He said they didn't recognize the presence of God in their day. &gt;&gt; Bride don't fight bride. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 6:19. What then? Knowest thou not that thou body is a temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, and which ye have of God, that ye are not your own. God owns you. God's anointing, the bride's anointing, if you want to change that over into God, the Greek word was Christ's anointing. Christ meant anointed one. The bride is the anointed one. Watch what our prophet said here. He said, you notice how God didn't move Israel until his own anointed time. See, there's a time for everything. Amen. And now listen, this is going to mean something. Joshua waited for that time. No matter how much the people might have said, see the people could have came to Joshua. See, Joshua was coming after Mo, you know, Joshua was far greater ministry than Moses ever was. Oh, a million times. Moses just brought them out. But Moses took them in and placed them. &gt;&gt; He took them to the Holy Ghost and placed them into their ownership. &gt;&gt; So the people could come and see that Joshua was raising up behind Moses and they'd say Joshua was waiting for the time no matter how. But here the people would say God gave us the land. Let's go the promised land. He said, "Let us go now and let the people would be encouraging Joshua to take it." And they might have said, "Joshua," this our prophet talking here, Joshua, you've lost your commission. You're all washed up. You don't do it like Moses used to do it. &gt;&gt; You're not doing this or you're not doing that. We used to do it this way. Now, thus saith the Lord in the moment, what was the will of God? But this wise, God sent a prophet that knew the promise of God. And he also knew to wait on the promise. A clear-cut decision from God for his time. And see these parables. Now, watch this. There's a prophet talking about the time come that God give it to Joshua who had stayed with him. Stayed by the word and he couldn't trust others but he could trust Joshua. &gt;&gt; So will that repeat again? That's what the prophet asks. Will we stay with the word &gt;&gt; even though we wonder God's timing? You know you know I I'll confess to you. Brother Dale thought the rapture would have already taken place. I would have never believed. I I just opened my heart. I would have never believed that the bride of Christ or believers in Canada would have lived through what they lived through in CO. I would never believe that. I would have flat out I would have preached against it. You see, we're going before the tribulation. &gt;&gt; But things have not worked out exactly like God's bride thought they might. &gt;&gt; But we're still here fighting. &gt;&gt; The greatest battle ever fought. But God has a time when he's going to take I know we're not going through the tribulation, but we're going to feel a certain amount of pressure. Everything God valued, he put under pressure. Gold, diamonds, coal, oil, everything put under pressure. &gt;&gt; And the bride he values is going to have a certain amount of pressure because the only thing you're taking with you is your character. &gt;&gt; And you only get character by pressure. How do you handle what you don't understand? &gt;&gt; That's what David had. David was put under enormous pressure running for his life from the very David went and and the very enemy that was trying to kill him. David went to play the harp. I couldn't have done it. Could have you. Could you went back after he threw the drive alone and stuck in the welder and just said, "Oh, David knew the hatred." David went right into the enemy camp and played with the anointing that removed the evil spirits. &gt;&gt; The bride has went into the enemy camp. You're living in neighborhoods that are the enemy camp. And with the a with God's anointing, you can remove the evil spirits &gt;&gt; because of your presence. &gt;&gt; They will desire to kill you because you're not of the world. If you were of the world, they would love you. But because you're of God, they don't understand you. &gt;&gt; For the world don't see me because they don't know me. It's the same with his bride. Amazing. Here we see in first Peter 2, 1 Peter 2:4, whom coming we are to become living stones, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God &gt;&gt; and precious. Ye also are living stones and are built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God in your environment. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what David was called to do. David was anointed for the throne, but he was playing for his enemies. &gt;&gt; Wow. And David had such the spirit of Christ that when he was encouraged to take his enemy's life and really justified in the natural. David was so careful. If we had the spirit of David, man, there would never be a divided nothing. &gt;&gt; He said, watch this. David even went out on a limb. He said, I would never lay a charge or touch. David's heart was pricricked because he took the garment of Saul when he could have took his life. And Saul was not David God's anointed because the Bible says the spirit of the God, the spirit of God left Saul and an evil spirit had tabernacled him. But David wouldn't take any chances. &gt;&gt; Wow. You don't know who's predestinated to be bride. &gt;&gt; Be careful. &gt;&gt; You know everything in the New Testament. You would be surp if you if your pastor come up here and preach who Jesus ministered to in the Bible. Most message churches would empty. Rahab in the wall, woman at the well, woman caught in the very act, the woman washing Jesus' feet. That was a sinful woman. &gt;&gt; And on and on. &gt;&gt; They would never be allowed to. This place is sacrifically holy. But God seen the anointing. see that that David's men seen the anointing on David even though the Hittite men seen the anointing even though David was still running for his life. There was no if you wouldn't have been there when Samuel anointed David, there was no physical evidence other than the spirit on David and his actions. There was no physical evidence that David was taking the throne. Do you know how many Jewish men that David had following him after that anointing? zero. Wow. Don't judge your church by numbers. &gt;&gt; You have everything you need right here. The Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Period. &gt;&gt; Everything he's gave for your journey is right here. It's not in what you see with the eye. You don't have to move anywhere. You just have to move in Christ. Drink and get big. Drink and get big. Watch what the prophet says here. Here, you know, in verse 9, it says, "But you are a chosen generation, a holy priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you into this from out of this darkness into his marvelous light." Here a prophet says in the days of Solomon so will it be in the coming of the son of man when he shall be revealed not more as the church but more as the bride called in fact the day of the son of man will be revealed what he said to join the church to the head it's a uniting of the marriage of the bride the bridegroom will come right through this and when the son of man will come down which he's he's already we already said that he came down he come down in revelation We read that. And when the son of man comes down and comes into human flesh, this quote proving his word 64. Oh, wait. And when he comes into human flesh and it unites the two together and the church has the word and he is the word and the two's united and then she'll go home to a wedding supper because she's already united. I mentioned this this morning. See, we're going to a wedding supper, not to a marriage. See, you have everything here to serve. You already are sitting in heavenly places here. &gt;&gt; You can have heaven on earth. What the prophet shown us is we can have heaven on earth here in your environment. &gt;&gt; You're in the David did. &gt;&gt; David did. He had heaven and earth. He was playing for his enemy. They're throwing spears at him. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Because the marriage of the lamb has come, but the rapture is going to be the wedding supper. And when the word unites with the person, that's you. When the word unites with the person, they too become one. And then that's what does it then? It's the manifestations of the son of God again &gt;&gt; in our day. &gt;&gt; The bride's anointing typing of David's anointing. He didn't have what was coming, but it's a glorious church without spot and wrinkle. Don't be deceived that the world think Revelations 1:6 it says, "And Christ has made us kings and priests." &gt;&gt; You feel How many feel like a king today? &gt;&gt; How many feel like priests? &gt;&gt; Unto God his father. Unto him be glory and dominion forever and ever. See, that's that's the anointing that's there. And it don't change your situation. David was anointed. David was as good a king running for his life as he was when he sat on the throne. &gt;&gt; He had the exact same backing. &gt;&gt; He was the same person. But God was building his character. &gt;&gt; So when he got there, he would know how to handle God's children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch this. 1 Corinthians 6:2. 1 Corinthians 6:2. Do you not know, saints, that ye shall judge the world? And if the world shall be judged by you, are ye not unworthy to judge the smallest matters amongst you? Know ye not that ye shall judge angels? And how many more things that pertainth to this life? See, it looks like we're It looks like you're an insignificant person, but your anointing is much bigger than your appearance. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to tell you something. Things are about to change. You'll have the same anointing, but it's a time. It's a time. Revelations 19 6-9 here. Revelations 19 it says and I heard a as it were a voice of a great multitude and the voice of many waters that's people and as the voice of many thundering saying Allah the Lord God omnipotent reignth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife his wife has made himself herself ready &gt;&gt; and to her is granted that she shall be arrayed and fine linen clean and right. You know the story of the the the rich businessman that was bringing his son down to find a bride for a wife &gt;&gt; and they brought him in the party and all the women were were dollied up and and and you know immature and and whatever they were doing in the party and the young man had character. He was looking for a wife. He wasn't looking for a some girl. He was looking for character. &gt;&gt; And he had to clear his head from all these Jezebels. And he went out and just out in the weather and just take a breath of air and go, "Whoa, whoa." And he spotted a little somebody &gt;&gt; that had been washed in the floor. She had no idea the anointing that was on her. &gt;&gt; Of course, everybody made fun of her. Sound familiar? &gt;&gt; Oh, little Oh, yeah. You got Why don't you join? But her groom said, "I'm coming back for you a year from today." So, she was preparing for what the anointing the that the promise was coming. Amen. And that's where the bride of Christ is. We know it's just around the corner. Just any day now. &gt;&gt; We're going to leave this place. &gt;&gt; Just any. But the anointing is already there. The ownership's already there. The the marriage is already there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Even though you're not sitting in the kingdom and even though you're not having servants, look at how David was compared to the bride. the bride's anointed. &gt;&gt; Wow. Revelations 21 9 and 10. And there came one of the seven angels with the seven vows full of seven plagues. And it talked with me, saying, "Come up hither and I'll show you the bride, the lamb's wife." And he carried me away in the spirit, the great high mountain. And he showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of God. God's done that to us. God's came in our day and brought a message that completely took the seals, opened the seals. And he said, "The Bible became a brand new book." He said, "I can read between the letters. It's a love letter." You know, he said, "Watch this." He said, "When I when my wife sends me a letter," he said, "I know exactly where she's sitting. I know exactly the environment. I know exactly whether the kids because I'm married to her." &gt;&gt; Amen. She's my wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The lamb's wife. And I'll carry her away in the spirit a great high mountain and show me the great city. See, God's doing this and he's shown us. But he's saying, "But why are we so rejected?" You're not rejected. The people, you know, the Bible said it like this. He said, "If you were of the world, they love you. But he that loved the world, there's love of God isn't in him. &gt;&gt; So see, you have everything you need. &gt;&gt; Your heavenly father, your bridegroom, Jehovah, Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's amazing. And in this message, he he revealed himself like never before. Why did he do when he told John to seal it up? Said, "Brother Dale ain't been born yet. It's not time. &gt;&gt; But in our day, everything, everything. There's not coming another message here. There ain't nothing more to reveal. He's unveiled himself. Who do you unveil yourself to his wife? &gt;&gt; He said, "This is who I am. This is what I am." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The bride's anointing is powerful. You can see the bride's anointing when you come into the full adoption of maturity. You know, he's coming for a lady. Man, here when we look at what the prophet says here, he says, "The way Christians are," he said, "we're planted together in Christ Jesus, who is the exhaustible, inexhaustible, sorry, fountain of life. And we're planted in Christ, and we just have to drink and drink and drink and push out." See, we're not looking for something new. Brother Dale can't bring you not something new. Your pastor knows twice as much as me in the word. It's it's it's there, but we just have to eat it and mature and grow and lay in the presence of the sun. Drink and push out everything you have need of. That's what the prophet says for your earthly journey. Divine healing, the power of God, all those other things, everything you have need. Every individual, it makes that very personal. Every individual in here that's received the baptism of the Holy Ghost, it's planted in Christ, has everything you need for your life journey. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost, the baptism, yes, sir. Everything you have need of in the life's journey. Even I mentioned this this morning. I had looked over these notes before I come. Even the rapture is in you right now. &gt;&gt; Now watch what the prophet says. He says, "Don't resent that. You're denying your anointing." He said, "Don't resent that. That's the truth. The rapture is in us right now." And he said, "I can prove it by the gospel." Those who he justified, those he he called, and those he has already glorified. Hallelujah. And we're heavenly bound. Amen. &gt;&gt; The bride. Amen. Th this is this is more than more than what you would recognize is the anointing of Jehovah. John 3 11 just laying a bit of scripture. Amen. Just a very but it's powerful when you we recognize the anointing here. John 3 verily verily I say unto you we speak that we know and testify in what we've seen and ye have received not our witness. And if I had told you earthly things and you believed them not how shall I tell you? How shall you believe if I tell you heavenly things? See, this is nothing but the truth. And no man has ascended up into heaven. See here, they had come to see Jesus and said, "Show us the father and it shall suffice us." He said, "I've been with you all this time and you never seen me. &gt;&gt; I'm right here. Take a look." And then Jesus said, "But no man has ascended up to heaven, but first he came down from heaven." And here, watch how Jesus talks. And the son of man is in heaven right now, but he was standing before them. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. How could the son of man be standing before the question and say, "The son of man's in heaven." Amen. &gt;&gt; Spirit. &gt;&gt; God is a spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was everywhere. You see how the anointing of Jehovah and the exact same anointing in measure is in his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. Watch this. You know, you you say when this scripture said I could testify, you know, I was sharing some testimonies with your pastor and I and I thought of one back there in the in the the uh the worship service. You know, we we're church and we had everything we need and we're in a church building and not not that that matters at all, but we were looking for nothing. So many times the bride of Christ ain't looking for nothing. And God will give you things that you're not even looking for to bless you. We had a brother come to me and he said, he said, 'Do, he said, 'I seen a piano on Facebook Marketplace, a grand piano, and we don't need a piano. We have the very beautiful electric piano, fancy one, and uh we're not even looking for one. And he said it was labeled for $2,500, but they lowered it to free. So he said, "If you're interested, I'll call them and see if that's real." Look at church. That's that sounds good. You know, you know, I I want to I want to go into this. Faith is not some big superman. You don't need a Goliath in faith. It was the plain weed of hissip. It grew everywhere. &gt;&gt; This anointing is everywhere. &gt;&gt; It's just common gospel of Jehovah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch this. So he called and he said, "Yeah, it's free." The husband had actually died. He was the piano player. So we went and get this panel. Now, I'm going to tell you something. If you ever seen a boat anchor, oh boy. Oh, boys, was it heavy? I mean, it was really heavy. I mean, I mean, it was heavier than heavy. and my boys and daughters took it apart and we put it on trailer and we brought to the church you know and and we were deciding where I mean it was it was wow I think when we went over the pews we had six people carrying this without the legs it was unbelievable so we have a man come to to tune it the man walks in we have sitting at the front now this is something we're not looking for we don't even need it but maybe I thought we needed it. And the piano guy walks in. He said, "That's a $4,000 piano." Said, "Oh, wow." Said, "That's that's amazing. Looked real nice. Match the pews. It was all, you know, about this color wood, you know, a little just slightly darker." And and he goes to tune the piano and he opens it up and he said, "This piano has brand new pins and brand new strings." He said, "That's another 4,000 $8,000 panel that we went 10 hours 10 minutes away to pick up for free. That's the bride's anointing." &gt;&gt; See, God can do anything. God will do things that you don't even have to ask for &gt;&gt; because you're his wife. &gt;&gt; You say, "But it was you didn't have to." You know, there was things that you don't have to pray for. God, and of course, we're supposed to pray. I don't mean that. &gt;&gt; But you can just ask God. You know, you have the mind of God. You don't have a selfish mind. A mature wife don't have a selfish mind. If God knows, if you need something, God knows you need it before you ask for it. &gt;&gt; For faith is the evidence of things hoped for, but but the evidence of things not seen. Now, I want to I want to show into this here. He said, "This is the kind of anointing that's on the bride. Don't look for some big earthly." Amen. It'll be a secret. I don't mean that God's hiding. I don't mean God's ashamed, but people won't see. You know what? You could be We've had We've had unbelievable miracles happen in our church. And and then like a month later, someone come up and say, "I don't see God moving." I'm just like, where were you? People have an unbelievable forgetter. An unbelievable forgetter. I mean I mean monthly. Probably more than that. See, we're blinded to the anointing. Watch this. The Jewish people were blinded to David's anointing. His family was blinded to his anointing. His dad was blinded to his anointing, &gt;&gt; but it was the Hittite men that were Gentiles &gt;&gt; would have been heathen, &gt;&gt; but they seen the power of God on his life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bride's anointing. &gt;&gt; You know, look at this. The church called Christ Jezebel and the devil called him Lord. When when Jesus went to cast the demons out of the bed, the pig said, "Why you here yet to torment it before our time?" That was the devil. &gt;&gt; So the devil recognized that he was Lord, but the religious people recognize things don't change. &gt;&gt; Things don't change. Amen. &gt;&gt; People that you think might recognize your gift might not. And somebody that you would never believe that would recognize the potential of God's anointing on your life will recognize it. &gt;&gt; God's sovereign. Watch this. He says, "And by the way, that hissup plant is a common weed." Hissup means your faith. Somebody tries to do some supernatural faith. There you go. Well, you got to have this super person come in and you got to have this super building and you got to drive this super suit and you got to have a super hairdo and you got to be able to just sing super duper. That's the reason you miss your healing. Faith is just the common thing. You know the combat people heard him gladly. &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to have faith to come to church. You got to have faith to walk out there. Watch this. You know, we have faith for the funniest things, but we have trouble trusting an omnipotent God. There's not one of you sitting here that's worried about your car starting in the parking lot. And it was made by a man that was probably in the union that didn't give a who. He said, "You got faith that your car will start. You got faith that you can eat your dinner." And that's just the way common faith is. You want to start your car and your kid needs healing. You can't get enough faith to heal your kid, but you got faith in some old battery that came from Japan. &gt;&gt; There's some things that you just got to take a hold of. You're the bride of Christ. You're the wife. &gt;&gt; You have some authority. You've recognized your place here. He said, watch this. Apply the blood. It was applied with hissup, which is a common weed that grows anywhere in Palestine. showing the faith of the blood being applied the same by by is not the same supper thing super thing that you got to have some watch this you you thought I was making this up he said you think you got to have apply some super thing and have this great doctor's degree to have some kind of move of God in your midst just common just common everyday people with just common everyday faith, just common everyday problems, but they got the power and the anointing of God in their life &gt;&gt; because they got God's heart. There's a there's an unspoken connection with the heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You You You don't think so? I could be anywhere in the world and look at my wife and I could read her like a book and her me. We could go to the airport. We Oh boy. What just happened? I never said a word. She could she could read frustration in me. She could read because there's a common unity. &gt;&gt; The same with you and God. It's just calm and hiss up. He said, "You don't have to have this great doctor's degree." He said, "Apply the blood by the faith with just hiss up." That's a token message. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm I'm going to just a couple more things here and we're not going to be long here. Hebrews I want to show you just a couple things here and then we'll close by God's grace. Just a couple quotes and a couple scripture. Hebrews 12:5 to8. He said, watch here. He said, you still, even though you got God's anointing on you, he's proven and showing you to the world. He He don't even have to try you to prove it to yourself. But he's he's using you to prove to Satan, watch this, that in the last day that this second Eve won't fall. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you say, "But God, why am I going through this?" It's all right. God knows exactly what he's doing. Watch Hebrews 12:5. And ye have forgotten the exhaustion, the ex exhortation, sorry, which was spake on unto you as unto children. My son, despise not the chastising of the Lord, nor faint when ye are rebuked of him. For whom the Lord loveth, he chastises, and scornneth every son whom he receiveth. And if ye endure chastising, God dealeth with you as sons. For what son is him who the father chastises? Not not God was putting David through the milk after he was anointed by God's prophet. &gt;&gt; I mean, hugely putting him through the milk. Amen. If we see this here, I want to just bring out in in 1 Samuel uh 30. And I'm not going to read it all, but I'm going to tell you the story here when David became king and they went off and they were fighting a battle and the enemy came in and took all their wives and children away. You remember that story in 1st Samuel 30th. And they came back and of course they were just destroyed. They were just just of course they were I mean disappointed is a terrible word but I mean really stunned destroyed and the very man that loved David picked up stones to kill him. Wait, how in the world was that David's fault? In verse six, it said, "And David was greatly distressed, for the people spake to stone him because the soul of all the people was grieved and every man and his sons and daughters." And David encouraged himself. David knew who he was. David knew who he was. And David encouraged himself in the Lord his God. &gt;&gt; There's times when everybody around you won't recognize the anointing, won't see what God's doing and will question. You know, when when the the man was healed with the black eyesight, the blind sight in the Bible, everybody in the church was the Pharisees was concerned who sinned. When Job when Job went through his trial, well, you've sinned, but none of those cases were because of sin. They were like, God would be glorified. &gt;&gt; So, you can be going through a mountain of a trial. &gt;&gt; Amen. If not, who? If not you, who? &gt;&gt; You know, we had a sister just healed from cancer. She had she had she had a tumor taken out like a fist and a half. Completely clean Bella out. &gt;&gt; Completely. See, if not us, who? &gt;&gt; She wasn't given that that demon of cancer because she was the bride of Christ. She wasn't given that because of sin. It wasn't given that because she wasn't loyal. It wasn't given that because God didn't love her. &gt;&gt; But if not us, who? &gt;&gt; God couldn't dress nobody else with the anointing. And he was showing that I can put this on them and they're still mine. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; David encouraged himself in the Lord. &gt;&gt; And this is our last quote. And it takes God's children to test them. A great test. Place them into the body of Christ. They believe and they went through trials. Believeth from the heart. This is the message. and they've had experiences and they've witnesses and know that they're talking about not just because see an indiv see I can show you how good God is but when you have your own experiences you can't take it away see Moses was anointed of God but when he experienced God after that burning bush nobody could take God from Moses &gt;&gt; before that he was just associated with him &gt;&gt; when you have the connection with God your husband yourself. No matter what I say, you're connected. &gt;&gt; That's what it's got to come to. &gt;&gt; See, if I can give you the Holy Ghost, then somebody else can take it from you. But when God gives it to you, nobody can take it from you. When God gives you the anointing of the bride, I can't take it from you. Lucifer can't take it from you. Nothing that the devil does can stop it, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "It's a time tested tribe until their souls are set firm towards Calvary." Yes, they're timeested. Their witness the power of God. I've seen far too good to accept not believe. That's impossible. You come too late to talk to Brother Dale. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's where every one of us God don't have any grandchildren. Every one of us got to come under that anointing &gt;&gt; and recognize. So don't look at excuse me if God's something's happening in your life. The anointing of God can be right there. &gt;&gt; You can just take Satan back and say right here. It was all done. &gt;&gt; Before God, I know where I come from, Satan. I know where I'm going. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's got It's not that God don't love you, but he can't prove himself through nobody else. &gt;&gt; He's got to prove himself through the bride, his wife. It's not because they don't love you. &gt;&gt; It's because have you ever considered my servant Job? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he stayed with the word. He upheld the word. Amen. Amen. That's where every one of us got to come to. David's anointing, the bride's anointing, excuse me. Even though he didn't have what was coming, it didn't change who David was. David before he sat on that throne and had an army and a kingdom and had servants and chariots and horses, he was a man after God's own heart. and the bride here tonight, you're a lady after God's own heart. Amen. Don't look at Don't look for something great. Don't look for a doctorate degree in in the spiritual realm to get me to there, man. God is in simplicity. God is in simplicity. He's in hissup in hissup faith. Go to your car and it'll start. That's the kind of God we serve. Amen. Everything you have need of &gt;&gt; is in you now. Man, don't think, well, oh, they got something over here. No. Amen. When when the Bible says, and I'm I'm literally closing my thing. You know, when the Bible says it says when they say that Christ is over here, don't run over there. They say, "Oh, but I seen something over here." Oh, the Don't run over there because he's in tabernacled inside you. I want I want to close with this. You know, when Jesus went to the garden and he prayed, who did he pray to? He prayed to himself. He said, "Father," see, Jesus was had a human body. You know, the the prophet said this. He said Jesus confused his disciples. Direct quote. He said sometimes he spoke from the flesh, sometimes he spoke from Jehovah. And he said they couldn't, they were confused. That was the word, but they they they they couldn't grasp it. That's exactly the way it is in the bride. That's exactly the way it was in our prophet's message. He was a a man that like hunting, but he had thus sayith the Lord. He had a human spirit, but he had also thus sayith the Lord. &gt;&gt; You're the bride of Christ, the wife of Christ. You have a human spirit. And here David, the prophet said that Jesus didn't want to die. Jesus actually wanted to get married. He said, he said he didn't want to leave his friends. And he goes to the garden and he and he's and he knows his lot in life is to hang on Calvary for me. And he says, "Father, twice, if it's possible, take this from me." Was he praying to the God in heaven? The God was inside of him. When you pray, you don't have to look at Yeah. It's fine if you do, but he's inside of you. The po if you own the ocean, we're not the ocean. He was the fullness of the Godhead bodily, but you're a tablespoon, but it's still the ocean. So, if I I say, "Lord, I need a loaf of bread tomorrow." I don't have to say, "Lord, wherever you are over in Pastor Jesse's church or or that big church or I say, Lord, I'm your child. I need a loaf of bread &gt;&gt; cuz he's stopping that great side of me." &gt;&gt; See, and that's how people would get the, you know, when you see how the prophet broke down the godhead. We're we're not going there. But see, Jesus prayed to himself because he was the son of God. God is a spirit. God was a manifestation. Jesus was a manifestation of God. He changed his mask. &gt;&gt; You know, today I'm preaching, tomorrow I'll be a farmer. I might go get in tractor and civate a field, but I'm still Dale. Jesus was still God. Amen. That's amazing. Don't underestimate who you are. Don't look for a big church, a big pastor, big doctorate ministry, and a and a choir and and whatever else that human people would look for. &gt;&gt; All that you have need of is right here. All that you have need of is right inside you. &gt;&gt; It's a divine anointing. God placed you where you are for a reason. Why do I live in Canada? Because God placed me there. Why do people live in Africa where they're poor? Because that's just where God placed them. Why do you live? It's God. We can't question God's anointing. And here here God was going to the prophet Samuel. And I I really am closing. But to hear the prophet say, "How long will you mourn what I'm doing? You're struggling. Just let God be God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just let God be God. God says, "I've moved on." Then he's moved on. In this case, he had removed his spirit from Saul. Because he had a man that had God's heart, man. He's not going to remove his heart from his bride. That's not going to happen. You are the second Eve in the Bible. And this Eve is not God knows you're not fallen because he ain't fallen and you're a part of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Then bride's anointing is typed in David. The heart of God. God loves you tonight. God bless you, pastor. God bless you. Amen. Amen.
