[12:48] Psalms you may be seen here let's take a
[12:50] few prayer requests by the grace of Lord
[12:52] a few announcements here I hope
[12:55] everybody saw my text the boy that we
[12:57] prayed for doing really good by the
[12:59] grace of Lord all the doctors he hasn't
[13:04] spoken yet but all the squeezing of the
[13:07] hands and all this alert signs he's met
[13:09] all those they're really happy and they
[13:12] were able to remove like we saw all the
[13:14] tumor they thought they could remove
[13:15] about 90% so they removed that but I got
[13:18] to see him on Sunday night and you know
[13:20] they're watching football and playing
[13:22] games and finally after it all settled
[13:23] down I just waited wait for the
[13:25] leadership of the Holy Spirit say can I
[13:27] pray for the boy so I laid my hands on
[13:29] him and I just came against that tumor
[13:32] and Jesus Christ name and the parents
[13:34] are crying so it was a real sweet
[13:35] atmosphere there and I felt really good
[13:37] about the prayer so I'm just gonna keep
[13:40] believing I just been praying all week
[13:41] that God finished the work heal and let
[13:43] somehow God get glory out of this and
[13:45] don't get me wrong I appreciate
[13:46] neurosurgeons I do they have a level of
[13:48] expertise I'll never understand but I
[13:52] was just praying God somehow did this
[13:53] and you get all the glory
[13:56] anyway but but as I told the mom I said
[13:58] I don't care what form the healing comes
[14:00] in we just want to see this life spared
[14:02] and it was just a chance to show the
[14:05] love of Jesus Christ I let her I let

[26:50] Laura thank you
[26:52] praise God amen
[26:54] let's take your Bibles let's go to
[26:55] Genesis chapter 1 I like to look at that
[26:59] numerology series I like to keep that
[27:00] going by God's grace I feel like I got
[27:02] away from it for a little while and I
[27:04] just want to try to stay in it and
[27:06] finish it here so let's go to Genesis
[27:08] chapter 1 and let's look at the number 7
[27:12] I was studying more I realized I didn't
[27:15] finish the chapter on number 7 so I went
[27:16] back and read it and I saw there's a
[27:18] whole lot more on number 7 so we look at
[27:21] number 7 here tonight by the grace of
[27:23] Lord this will be part eight in the
[27:25] series on biblical numerology hope it's
[27:29] been a blessing to you praise God I
[27:31] talked to different preachers and
[27:32] they've said I've never heard a sermon
[27:34] or a series on by biblical numbers so
[27:37] that makes me feel good like I feel like
[27:38] it's a fresh thought from the Holy
[27:40] Spirit that's why I like that I like to
[27:42] go deeper with things I've never known
[27:44] before and all of this church is to
[27:46] point us to one person Jesus Christ that
[27:49] we can know him better and nobody he's
[27:51] trying to tell us he's trying to make
[27:53] himself known in these numbers praise
[27:55] God so Genesis chapter 1 I just want to
[28:00] read the scripture about the seventh day
[28:05] it's actually it's chapter two I'm sorry
[28:08] forgive me let's go to chapter two verse
[28:09] one and two part me Genesis 2:1 and to
[28:16] thus the heavens and the earth were
[28:18] finished and all the host of them that's
[28:21] reversed two together one two three and
[28:24] on the seventh day God ended his work
[28:27] which he made and he rested on the
[28:31] seventh day from all his work which he
[28:34] had made let's have one more word of
[28:35] Prayer as we bow our heads Heavenly
[28:37] Father
[28:38] the Lord God we read your holy word
[28:39] father we saw how you created Lord and
[28:42] you rested on the seventh you completed
[28:45] it on the seventh day and fathers we
[28:47] look at the number seven speak to our
[28:49] hearts let us see what you have
[28:51] completed let us see how you put your
[28:53] stamp of completion Lord and all
[28:56] throughout the scripture and father let
[28:58] us have the confidence to know that
[28:59] you'll complete your work in our lives
[29:02] dear God help us Lord to see how you're
[29:05] making yourself known to us all through
[29:07] the Bible through sevens in Jesus
[29:10] Christ's name the church said Amen god
[29:13] bless your being to see to praise the
[29:14] Lord so you can switch over there Lydia
[29:21] and I think I got I got some slides for
[29:22] us here tonight I'm gonna try to preach
[29:24] 45 minutes again I worked out pretty
[29:25] good on Sunday I preached an hour I said
[29:28] 45 minutes I only went 15 minutes over
[29:30] so I felt pretty good about that so
[29:32] let's look at this here by the grace of
[29:34] the Lord I'm really gonna try to preach
[29:38] seven okay so this is part 8 I said part
[29:41] six on Sunday I was wrong I looked it up
[29:43] it was par seven so the today's part
[29:45] eight we're looking at the number seven
[29:46] again I imagine I'll have one more
[29:47] sermon on 7 and then I'll probably have
[29:49] eight and nine so maybe next Wednesday
[29:52] we'll see what the Lord allows one look
[29:54] at these numbers here to try to get you
[29:57] to see the full thought a church of this
[29:59] don't prove this is eternal this is not
[30:01] an eternal book I don't know what does
[30:03] how you see all these numbers all the
[30:05] way through our God is so perfect and
[30:07] church people are listening you know I
[30:09] had my friend from high school who was
[30:11] basically he's in high school just text
[30:13] me this morning you said I've been
[30:14] listening and listening and watching
[30:15] your teachings on Facebook and he said I
[30:18] had it he said this is why I chose
[30:20] number three on the foot on the football
[30:21] team you know and because he said God
[30:23] perfects everything in threes so a
[30:26] person I never thought would be
[30:27] interested in God they're watching us
[30:30] but RAM said some people person night
[30:33] might never go to church but they'll go
[30:35] to church by watching your life amen yes

[30:39] Facebook everything that goes on there
[30:41] everything that I do everything you say
[30:44] everything I say somebody's watching and
[30:46] it's going to influence um one way or
[30:48] the other
[30:49] we've got to influence them for Jesus
[30:50] Christ
[30:51] I don't know what happened like I said I
[30:53] don't know what people would choose but
[30:55] I know what I'm gonna choose I know for
[30:57] as for me in my house I'm gonna serve
[30:58] the Lord Jesus Christ praise God
[31:01] so be encouraged and just know that God
[31:04] is speaking through your life God is

[31:30] so I just thought that was encouraging
[31:33] you know to know that and I listened to
[31:35] it again because there's a little bit of
[31:36] a minister's battle going on on Facebook
[31:38] with you know Christmas so I kind of
[31:40] want to see what did I preach I forgot
[31:42] what I preached and I just want to make
[31:43] sure I said everything right but I'm
[31:46] sorry I won't be here Sunday for
[31:47] Christmas but may the lord give you the
[31:49] BAM said one of the Marius Christmases
[31:51] he said you have such a Merry Christmas
[31:53] let it be a sacred time Church but as I
[31:56] was listening I just remember call this
[31:58] if you go to a party or family party or
[32:00] work party just make sure you let the
[32:02] light of Jesus Christ shine in your life
[32:05] be show moderation you're not you're not
[32:07] the one drinking all the punch and
[32:09] you're not the one you know you're not
[32:12] the one watching the TV or like that
[32:14] you're the one that's really godly
[32:15] you're the one that's so salty people
[32:19] get thirsty talking to you amen
[32:22] so my inspiration church I believe comes
[32:25] from Christ from this of course the
[32:27] message brother my always talks about
[32:28] God's biblical numerology and his
[32:30] numbers and then of course if you
[32:33] haven't seen this book if you can buy
[32:35] the book or you can find it online it's
[32:37] called a number in Scripture by I think
[32:38] it's JW Bollinger or something like that
[32:40] so I've just been reading this book and
[32:43] then pulling all the thoughts that I can
[32:44] find and then as I pull them then the
[32:47] Holy Spirit remind me what brother
[32:48] branham's said about this or what about
[32:49] that and I just I'm just trying to put
[32:51] it all together by the grace of the Lord
[32:54] so remember number seven means
[32:56] completion I'm not going to spend much
[32:57] time on this we know what Branham said
[32:59] he said its completion God's perfect in
[33:01] his word I think you're gonna see he's
[33:03] perfect in his word tonight all the
[33:04] seven
[33:05] in here in the word eventually we'll get
[33:08] to the book of Hebrews there's so many
[33:10] sevens I never knew it in the book of
[33:12] Hebrews we could spend the whole sermon
[33:13] just on the sevens if we want to read
[33:15] all the scriptures in the book of
[33:17] Hebrews now but let's start with this I
[33:19] mean maybe I'll just maybe I'll make
[33:21] that my goal to get to Hebrews and we'll
[33:23] just read some of those I'll try to go
[33:26] through these maybe a little brief
[33:27] little briefly so there are seven
[33:30] miracles in the book of Saint John
[33:32] there's the water turned to wine the
[33:35] nobleman's son was healed in chapter
[33:37] four in Chapter five the pool bethesda
[33:39] the man was healed there chapter six the
[33:42] feeding of the 5,000 was Americo the man
[33:44] born blind was Americo how he was healed
[33:46] the raising of Lazarus and then after
[33:49] Jesus resurrection the draught of fishes
[33:51] and so this proves completion there's
[33:54] seven miracles so it's complete proof of
[33:56] the signs that Jesus was the Christ they
[33:59] meant in the book of John seven miracles
[34:03] I like this one there's seven gifts that
[34:05] Christ gives us in the book of st. John
[34:07] there's seven things the Bible said he's
[34:09] going to give first when he says I'm
[34:11] gonna give my flesh for the world amen
[34:14] and he said I'm gonna give my life and
[34:16] then he says he gives his example of he
[34:19] you know he took off his outer garment
[34:21] and he went and washed their feet he
[34:23] said I'm giving you an example and then
[34:26] he said I'm gonna give you that I'm
[34:27] gonna send you the comforter I'm gonna
[34:29] give it and they got for that gift I
[34:31] don't know yeah that's what we need
[34:32] today we need comfort today and Laodicea
[34:34] then he said I'm gonna leave you my
[34:37] peace I'm gonna give you that peace and
[34:40] then he said he said I'm gonna give you
[34:43] my words he said they're gonna go to the
[34:44] disciples and then through the disciples
[34:47] they'll come to you and then he said I'm
[34:49] gonna share glory so let's go to that
[34:50] one let's read that one because that
[34:51] might be a little bit unfamiliar John 17
[34:54] 22 let's read that you know there's a
[34:59] certain glory that we experienced of
[35:01] course you know God's glory in our lives
[35:04] and then there's a certain glory he's
[35:06] going to share with us like we're gonna
[35:08] have a certain anointing that will be
[35:09] glorious and the angels will look on us
[35:12] and they won't be able to understand it
[35:13] because they've never been redeemed
[35:15] they've always been saved but we'll have
[35:17] a certain glow
[35:18] because we've experienced sin and death
[35:21] but we've been redeemed and purchased by
[35:24] the blood of God's own son
[35:27] it says that even the Angels can't even
[35:30] experience but thank God for the angels
[35:33] amen
[35:33] we're not whenever we never we never
[35:35] want to say oh we're better than the
[35:36] Angels you know we don't want to use
[35:38] that quote or the scripture the wrong
[35:41] way we just want to understand they're
[35:43] just different positions praise God
[35:45] so John 17 22 I started verse 20 neither
[35:49] pray I for these alone but for them also
[35:51] which shall believe on me through their
[35:53] word that's where Jesus prayed for you
[35:55] Church right there
[35:56] amen I know you can't say well Jesus
[35:59] never prayed for me right there he
[36:01] prayed for you I'm praying for all them
[36:03] that here my disciples and then that
[36:05] here on me through their word well
[36:07] you've heard through their word verse 21
[36:09] that they all may be one as thou father
[36:12] art in me and I in thee that they also
[36:15] may be one in us see there's that let us
[36:18] there's that same us Jesus is using us
[36:21] and that's a plural pronoun right that
[36:26] the world may believe that thou has sent
[36:30] me verse 22 and the glory which thou
[36:33] gave us me I have given them he said
[36:36] I've already given them that glory amen
[36:39] hallelujah that they may be one even as
[36:42] we are one so if the glory of God is
[36:45] upon us what will it bring it bring a
[36:48] unity praise God because he says I've
[36:50] given my disciples that glory that they
[36:54] may be one so there's such glory when
[36:57] people visit our church and they feel a
[36:59] unity in our church there's a special
[37:02] glory when we have Kerry ends or when
[37:04] we're just fellowshipping out here we're
[37:05] talking there's such a glory when people
[37:07] can feel unity or we can feel you need
[37:10] that we all want the same thing we all
[37:12] want Jesus to be glorified we want
[37:14] everybody to church to obey God's Word
[37:16] that's all we want aim ahead we just
[37:18] want to go in the rapture praise God
[37:20] we don't want to miss it we don't want
[37:21] to go to the tribulation we are that
[37:23] unity we want to be saved amen
[37:25] so see that's God's glory he said I'm
[37:28] giving them the glory that you gave me
[37:31] praise God
[37:32] so it's the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[37:34] to be unified that's the glory Jesus
[37:37] said I'm gonna give them the glory that
[37:39] they may be
[37:39] you want praise God aren't you gonna
[37:42] half of those seven gifts see before I
[37:44] read this I didn't know Jesus gave us
[37:46] seven gifts in the book of Saint John
[37:47] he gave us complete gifts amen I like
[37:50] that
[37:51] now I didn't actually read through these
[37:53] I just actually had time just to put
[37:55] this down well there are seven times he
[37:56] mentions the last day let's read them
[37:58] since we're right here in John let's go
[38:00] to John 639 I know one of them is an
[38:04] actual natural day the Feast of the
[38:06] Tabernacles where that's in John 7 but
[38:10] let's go to John 639 let's look at these
[38:13] last days now I did look it up I did
[38:17] type in last days and book of John and
[38:19] there are only are seven so that was
[38:21] right I knew there was seven but I
[38:23] didn't get a chance to read them all
[38:24] through let's read them here and see
[38:26] what the Lord says about the last day
[38:28] all right John 639 and this is the
[38:31] Father's will which he has sent me that
[38:33] of all which he hath given me I should
[38:35] lose nothing but should raise it again
[38:37] I'm sure raise it up again at the last
[38:39] day amen so that's speaking of the white
[38:42] throne judgment amen
[38:44] so all those the last day has to be the
[38:46] right throne judgment because after that
[38:48] he turned he sets in just struck me
[38:50] right there under there yeah that's the
[38:52] last day and after that there's just one
[38:55] eternal day ah it's always gonna be that
[38:58] same day amen hallelujah all right verse
[39:02] 40 is the second one and this is the
[39:04] will of him that sent me that everyone
[39:05] which has see at the Son and believeth
[39:07] on him may have everlasting life and I
[39:09] will raise him up at the last day
[39:11] amen at church you understand that even
[39:13] foolish virgins when they're really
[39:16] saved they have eternal life already not
[39:18] in them but they have eternal life
[39:20] waiting because jesus said whoever
[39:22] believes in me he said has passed from
[39:25] death unto life a foolish virgin has
[39:28] eternal life waiting for them they
[39:30] passed from death and they've got life
[39:32] amen
[39:33] praise God but see as a Christian now
[39:37] with the Holy Ghost is come now we pass
[39:40] from death unto life but now we have
[39:42] eternal life
[39:43] already in us praise God that's the
[39:46] difference but they've got as long as
[39:48] their names on the book of life
[39:49] they've got eternal life promised and
[39:51] they passed from death
[39:52] not gonna die they're not going to hell
[39:54] later hell fire lake fire they're gonna
[39:57] be saved and they've got the promise of
[39:59] it and they already believe it but see
[40:01] us we've got to have it and we got to
[40:04] show it to other people praise God amen
[40:06] now verse 44 this is what I'm saying
[40:10] here no man can come to me except the
[40:12] Father which has sent me draw him and
[40:14] I'll raise him up at the last day
[40:15] amen hallelujah who's gonna raise him up
[40:18] Jesus is gonna raise him up at the last
[40:21] day who's gonna raise you if we die and
[40:23] go to the grave who's gonna raise your
[40:24] body up Jesus Christ will raise you up
[40:27] amen he said I'm gonna raise you up so
[40:29] the PAS the fullness of the Godhead
[40:31] bodily will be in Christ and he'll speak
[40:34] the word and he'll say let that leão to
[40:36] see him bride come up and she'll come up
[40:38] amen hallelujah verse 54 whoso eateth my
[40:44] flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal
[40:46] life and I'll raise him up at the last
[40:48] day
[40:49] a man beautiful go to chapter 7 37 this
[40:53] is the one I was speaking of earlier
[40:54] this is the one that speaks of a literal
[40:57] day yeah in the last day that great day
[41:01] of the feast see Jesus stood and cried
[41:03] saying if a man thirst let him come unto
[41:05] me and drink now Church you catch this
[41:08] he said come to me and drink but the
[41:10] Holy Ghost hasn't even fallen yet is
[41:12] anybody catch that he's saying come to
[41:15] me and drink and now this is before he's
[41:18] been crucified this is before the forty
[41:20] days he's seen by the 500 people at one
[41:23] time this is well before that he's
[41:29] saying a live voice come to me a drink
[41:31] and yet if he came at that moment they
[41:33] came at that moment they wouldn't be
[41:35] born again so what does it mean if you
[41:38] really love Jesus you're willing to come
[41:39] to him now but you're willing to stay
[41:41] with him amen
[41:42] that was the difference look at verse 38
[41:45] he that believeth on me as the scripture
[41:46] has said out of his belly shall flow
[41:48] rivers of living water
[41:50] so he's preaching if you come and
[41:52] believe on me you'll have rivers flow
[41:53] out of you but they're not gonna get it
[41:55] that day they've got to hang around well
[41:59] jesus said I was going to have it if I
[42:00] came and so they couldn't complain they
[42:04] could say well I didn't have the rivers
[42:05] you
[42:06] let's stay with Jesus until the rivers
[42:08] flow out of your heart amen look at
[42:11] verse 39 and this proves our right here
[42:13] look at verse 39 but this making of the
[42:15] spirit which they that believe on him
[42:17] should receive for the Holy Ghost was
[42:20] not yet given because that Jesus was not
[42:22] yet glorified amen I hope everybody can
[42:26] catch that tonight by God's grace he's
[42:29] saying come he's speaking of some future
[42:30] he says come to me and you'll have
[42:32] rivers flowing out he'll just have all
[42:34] this praise amen here's have all these
[42:37] songs yours have all this worship
[42:39] flowing out of you but they were not
[42:41] going to get it that day they had to
[42:43] hang around and they had to go to
[42:45] Pentecost and they had to be there when
[42:47] the Holy Ghost fell and then the rivers
[42:49] of God would flow out of their mouths
[42:51] amen
[42:53] see that church that's how we got that's
[42:55] how we got to believe every promise of
[42:57] God like we said on Sunday night with
[42:58] divine healing we would preach on that
[42:59] on Sunday night even if you don't have
[43:01] it right and then if you don't even have
[43:03] the revelation but just keep confessing
[43:05] it just keep believing it until that
[43:07] revelation comes they need glory that's
[43:10] what he's saying here come to me rivers
[43:12] will flow out of you rivers of water
[43:14] will flow out but it may not happen now
[43:16] but stay with me it'll happen to you
[43:18] eventually
[43:19] oh that's right amen John 1124 that's so
[43:26] important to understand Church they
[43:28] would did not receive rivers of water at
[43:30] that moment they had to go to Pentecost
[43:32] and receive the Holy Ghost
[43:33] [Music]
[43:35] John 1124 okay this is Martha okay yeah
[43:41] Martha say than him I know that he shall
[43:43] rise again in the resurrection at the
[43:45] last day so again she's speaking of that
[43:47] day the white throne judgment right all
[43:50] right that's all right now
[43:52] 12:48 john 12:48 there's seven last days
[43:58] mentioned in the John but of course many
[44:01] of them are speaking of that white
[44:03] throne judgment
[44:04] 12:48 father glue
[44:10] father name I'm in the wrong spot yeah
[44:14] I'm in the wrong spot 12:40 okay he that
[44:16] rejecteth me and receiveth not my words
[44:18] hath one that judgeth him the word that
[44:20] I've spoken the same shall judge him in
[44:22] the last day church you know you know I
[44:26] don't have to worry
[44:26] why don't what is God what does Christ
[44:28] gonna judge us about in the day of
[44:29] judgment whatever is right in here
[44:31] that's what I like to give my life to
[44:33] this right here I'll spend all my time
[44:35] right here because I know this is what
[44:37] we're gonna be judged by I want to make
[44:39] sure that you and I pass the judgement
[44:41] other there yeah I want to make sure
[44:44] that's one thing I got to make sure my
[44:46] life is I passed that judgment test amen
[44:48] I got to study that word and be in that
[44:51] word enjoy that word love that word line
[44:53] my life up with the word amen and how do
[44:57] you do that you let the word judge you
[44:59] every day
[45:00] now today church I had to repent to two
[45:02] people because I made a mistake today
[45:03] can I tell that real quick
[45:05] does everybody knows that I'm human okay
[45:06] is that the end of the day all the kids
[45:09] have already gone home the secretary
[45:11] calls over the loudspeaker and said mr.
[45:13] Smith do you have so-and-so to give to a
[45:15] parent and I said the wrong thing I said
[45:18] no the parent didn't email me soon
[45:20] enough so I put the blame on the parent
[45:22] as soon as I said I was like that's not
[45:24] right and so I was walking out and I was
[45:28] like lord I got a call I gotta say it
[45:29] wasn't their fault the fault was I
[45:31] didn't have a time to check my email all
[45:33] afternoon I was like Lord will you help
[45:35] me make this right with both the
[45:37] secretary and the parent and I was
[45:40] walking out to my car the Secretary's
[45:42] walking out and I just said Gauri there
[45:44] she is I can apologize so I walked up to
[45:46] her and I said I'm so sorry I made it
[45:48] sound like it was the parents fault it
[45:50] was not the parents fault it was my
[45:51] fault and the schedule because I
[45:53] couldn't check my email the rest of the
[45:56] afternoon
[45:56] so I said forgive me and she's just kind
[45:58] of blew it off she's like you know oh
[45:59] that's okay everybody makes mistakes but
[46:02] I just said forgive me I'm so sorry see
[46:04] that what is that church that's the word
[46:06] judging me every single day the word has
[46:09] got to judge you all day if you make a
[46:11] mistake say Lord forgive me God will
[46:12] help you do it
[46:13] so I got in the car before I drove off I
[46:16] dialed the parents number I said will
[46:17] you please forgive me I put the pressure
[46:19] I put the blame on you I didn't mean to
[46:22] put the blame on you it was my fault I
[46:24] it was not your fault would you forgive
[46:26] me and she said of course seekers this
[46:32] is going to judge us we've got to be
[46:34] judged by the Word of God these are not
[46:37] little things everything's a big li but
[46:39] the Bram said the reason people don't
[46:40] get further with God is because they is
[46:42] not because they don't do the big things
[46:44] they don't do the little things right
[46:46] they let the little things go and pretty
[46:48] soon a little thing turns into a big old
[46:50] nasty thing right so I got to get that
[46:54] lion thing that just that was just it
[46:56] was alive I think I was stressed out at
[46:57] the end the day wherever that lion thing
[46:59] was in there I just said God forgive me
[47:01] I didn't mean to say that sometimes we
[47:04] just speak before we think about it so
[47:07] I'm human but I know Jesus Christ is
[47:09] supernatural amen and he helps me to
[47:11] stay pure so there you go there you go
[47:14] the same should judge him in the last
[47:15] day the Word of God that we preach and
[47:18] Jesus preached will judge us at the last
[47:20] day all right
[47:21] did you know this there's seven miracles
[47:23] wrought by Christ on this Sabbath day
[47:27] seven is completion so Jesus was showing
[47:31] that the Sabbath day is going to be
[47:33] completely changed I says I'm saying on
[47:36] Sunday it's not it's you know Sunday as
[47:38] our natural day built in to be our day
[47:40] of rest for most people and I know
[47:41] brother Aaron has to work on Sundays but
[47:43] for most people it's bill in it's a
[47:46] natural day of rest we don't go to our
[47:48] regular jobs but that's not the real
[47:51] Sabbath the real Sabbath is you ceasing
[47:53] from your works and doing what the Holy
[47:56] Ghost has called you to do that's the
[47:57] real Sabbath entering into the real rest
[48:00] where you rest in the finished work and
[48:02] the blood of Jesus Christ amen and
[48:04] because I'm resting on that I want to do
[48:07] something for Jesus for his glory but
[48:10] see he healed a withered hand on the
[48:12] Sabbath he cast out an unclean spirit he
[48:14] owed a peter smother in law he healed a
[48:18] woman and Luke 13 let's read that when I
[48:19] don't know what that one was I I don't
[48:22] remember that one Luke 13 11 which woman
[48:26] was that oh we have the spirit of
[48:30] infirmity 18 years and was bowed
[48:33] together and can no wise lift herself up
[48:35] she couldn't even lift herself up she's
[48:37] so tied up
[48:38] together and jesus healed her on the
[48:40] Sabbath day hey man that is something a
[48:43] woman who couldn't work now she can work
[48:46] amen now she'll have to sit there all
[48:48] the time and it's a day of rest but on
[48:50] the day of rest God's still working amen
[48:52] I like that God working when we take a
[48:54] rest or we take a break
[48:55] god never takes a break he's always
[48:57] working amen he said he took the one
[48:59] break on the day of the seventh day but
[49:01] then Satan interrupted it right he's
[49:03] been working ever since even cuz gods
[49:06] outside of time amen
[49:07] gods outside of that and he works on the
[49:09] Sabbath the man with drops he was healed
[49:12] by Christ the impotent man was healed by
[49:14] Christ and the man born blind seven
[49:17] miracles right on the Sabbath day he was
[49:20] completing any doubt about the Sabbath
[49:22] days completing and saying it's not a
[49:24] about a day it's about the power of God
[49:27] amen
[49:27] that's right seven completion now this
[49:34] is what I've been writing a book on I
[49:35] wrote about 6,000 words on this chapter
[49:37] there are seven parables complete that
[49:40] completely reveal there's work complete
[49:43] seven is completion completely reveal
[49:45] the kingdom of heaven in Matthew 13 so I
[49:48] wrote a chapter on that and it's the
[49:50] next book I'll be working on here I'm
[49:52] actually on the third chapter right now
[49:54] I'm working on the Godhead chapter
[49:55] because there's 12 New Testament
[49:57] mysteries I got the introduction chapter
[49:59] done I got this chapter and then I'm
[50:02] working on the Godhead
[50:03] so the first parable is the sower in the
[50:06] foregrounds and this revelation is that
[50:09] there's four heart reactions to hearing
[50:11] preaching about Jesus Christ there's
[50:14] four there's only four reactions there's
[50:15] four type of grounds and church we need
[50:18] to have good grounds that means good
[50:19] honest hearts we can't have hearts that
[50:22] let all the cares of the world live as
[50:24] we were saying last Wednesday choke it
[50:25] out
[50:25] we can't let things choke out our
[50:27] spiritual life we've got to choke out
[50:28] the devil amen we've got to choke out
[50:32] his life don't let him choke out our
[50:34] live oh I'm getting weaker and weaker
[50:35] weaker as a Christian say no devil I'm
[50:38] gonna choke you I'm gonna squeeze you
[50:42] the life out of your life whatever you
[50:44] say I'm gonna squeeze your little neck
[50:46] in it I'm gonna get the victory I'm more
[50:48] than a conqueror amen
[50:50] squeeze out his life you and I
[50:52] not gonna be the wayside you proved it
[50:53] by your life I proved it by my life
[50:55] we're not by the wayside and we're not
[50:57] on stony ground or anything like that
[50:59] we've got to be careful that the devil
[51:01] doesn't we don't let the devil squeeze
[51:02] out our life we've got to squeeze out
[51:04] his life the weed the tares number two
[51:08] and the revelation is that each person
[51:10] is either a child of God or Satan and
[51:12] the churches are full of both brother
[51:15] man have said the field is the church
[51:17] ages remember brother Simon preached
[51:18] that he found that with such a
[51:19] revelation to him and me to the field is
[51:22] the church ages and their house Oh
[51:24] father's full of wheat and tares Satan
[51:26] you know started off good but then Satan
[51:28] brought in all these deeds of
[51:29] Nicolaitans doctrines of Balaam and all
[51:31] these Jezebel religion and now it's just
[51:33] full of tears but there's a few we in
[51:35] there still and that's what he's coming
[51:37] back for amen amen
[51:39] he's coming back for weak takuya the
[51:43] third one is the grain of mustard seed
[51:44] brother man said the false church
[51:46] started out small like a grain of
[51:48] mustard seed but it grew until it's full
[51:51] large and filled with all demonic powers
[51:54] so brother Graham in the church age book
[51:55] likens the Roman Catholic Church to a
[51:58] church that started off as a grain of
[52:00] mustard seed but it grew so great to
[52:02] announce the biggest Church in the world
[52:04] it's got almost two billion members
[52:06] there's only 7 billion people on the
[52:08] earth Church and it's almost got two
[52:10] billion the fourth one is the leaven hid
[52:14] in three measures of meal and this has
[52:16] to be this cannot be the true church
[52:18] because the true church does not deal
[52:20] with leaven we see what's your sin it
[52:22] has to be the Roman Catholic Church
[52:24] again that she hides lies the this
[52:29] threefold lies and her teachings until
[52:32] the entire doctrine is fully corrupted
[52:34] and of course what were those three
[52:36] measures Father Son Holy Ghost
[52:38] I've been studying on that there's a lot
[52:41] of history on that there's a lot of
[52:43] false doctrine on that or I'm sorry it
[52:45] exposes the false doctrine on the
[52:47] Trinity now Church did you know this the
[52:50] Roman Catholic Church did not declare
[52:53] that the holy ghost was a person until
[52:56] 381 ad can you believe that brother
[53:01] Aaron it took them almost four hundred
[53:02] years to realize the Holy Ghost was a
[53:04] person
[53:06] but right after on the day of Pentecost
[53:08] Peter got lied to you by Ananias and
[53:12] Sapphira and Peter says you've lied to
[53:14] the Holy Ghost and because you've lied
[53:16] to the Holy Ghost
[53:17] you're gonna repack your body out of
[53:19] here dead and then a few verses later
[53:22] Luke records it as they lied to God amen
[53:27] Peter said the Holy Ghost Luke said God
[53:30] so the early disciples knew that the
[53:33] Holy Ghost is a person the Holy Ghost is
[53:35] God but it took the Trinitarians almost
[53:38] 400 years to know that the Holy Ghost
[53:39] was a person amen oh it's so foolish
[53:42] it's so full of folly and what are they
[53:45] doing Church all behind it is they're
[53:47] mimicking all those false three-person
[53:49] God's the Hindu one and I forget all the
[53:52] other ones I haven't I need to study on
[53:54] that I'm not done with that chapter I'm
[53:55] still working on the chapter but see it
[53:57] said three measures three measures of
[53:59] living this the father that false life
[54:01] father son only goes now it was God
[54:03] Father Son Holy Ghost of course he is
[54:05] not my person but by manifestation
[54:08] praise God
[54:10] but see 11 always as sin in the Bible 11
[54:14] is all wasted I've never found one
[54:16] scripture where 11 was actually a good
[54:18] thing it's all here up here is always
[54:19] represents sin now number 5 the treasure
[54:22] in a field brother man or the Bible says
[54:25] a true believer joyfully trades all his
[54:28] possession at the surprising opportunity
[54:31] to gain Christ so this one's about when
[54:34] u s-- Christ surprises your life did he
[54:36] surprise your life one day the Bible
[54:39] said the man was just look in the field
[54:40] and all of a sudden oh the joy that he
[54:43] found this treasure oh it's just hidden
[54:44] I wasn't even looking for that's how it
[54:47] was for me in the message he meant I
[54:48] wasn't looking forward I long hair I was
[54:50] gonna be in the NFL I thought I was
[54:52] gonna be some bigshot
[54:53] but all of a sudden I stumbled on the
[54:55] message of the hour and it surprised me
[54:57] but that's okay I went and sold out
[54:59] everything to buy the field that had the
[55:02] treasure amen I could thank God it's
[55:04] been a real treasure praise to the heart
[55:07] but a greater treasure than anything
[55:09] else I never would have made the NFL but
[55:11] I just I thought I was so don't let
[55:13] people tell you I never would have made
[55:14] the NFL I doubt it very very much now a
[55:19] number
[55:19] six the one probe great price a true
[55:22] believer abandons his search for many
[55:25] spiritual truths in order gain the one
[55:27] most valuable truth
[55:29] that's Christ he member because the
[55:31] Bible said he's he's he already seeking
[55:33] goodly pearls he wants a lot of great
[55:35] troops and people can find good things
[55:37] about Mahatma Gandhi they can find good
[55:39] things maybe Mohammed said or all these
[55:41] spiritual truths but when you find the
[55:44] one Pearl great price all these other
[55:46] things that are good you realize the
[55:48] only thing that's good about it is
[55:49] because they borrowed from Jesus ain't
[55:51] it so I get rid of all these little
[55:53] pearls and I'll just take the one great
[55:55] pearl praise God the pearl of great
[55:58] price like there's good things in
[56:00] Taekwondo mankind I've been learning
[56:02] about even Confucianism it's a good
[56:04] thing like it's recent you know a part
[56:05] of its good respecting elders there's
[56:07] nothing that's a good thing to do you
[56:10] know showing honor to the outer day
[56:11] those are the Bible talks about that
[56:13] give double honor to the elders you know
[56:15] you give them double honor and there's
[56:17] good things but those are all just
[56:18] little pearls but where we find Christ
[56:21] we find the true reality of elders
[56:24] because they take it too far
[56:25] they take it where you only have to
[56:27] follow everything your grandpa says if
[56:29] the oldest person alive in your family
[56:32] if they say no to Christianity you've
[56:33] got to follow because you got to honor
[56:35] your elders now see that's just a small
[56:37] pearl and that's alive from hell that's
[56:40] an evil thing and we ought to be able to
[56:42] forsake that to find the real pearl
[56:44] Jesus Christ and no matter how old
[56:47] somebody is you respect them you love
[56:48] them but you love them with the love of
[56:50] Christ and Jesus said if you love me he
[56:52] said you'll forsake father mother sister
[56:55] brother husband father-in-law
[56:57] mother-in-law you'll forsake everything
[56:59] he said I come to bring a sword in your
[57:01] house amen
[57:02] hallelujah to see Confucianism is like
[57:06] little tiny pearls but we don't want
[57:08] that we want the pearl of great price
[57:09] amen
[57:10] and anything that would shine in
[57:13] Confucianism or Hinduism anything that
[57:15] would seem good is already in Christ
[57:18] they just borrowed and stole from him
[57:20] is that right hallelujah because he's
[57:24] the source of every good and perfect
[57:25] gift he's the source of life everything
[57:27] comes from God I'd rather have the one
[57:29] pearl of great price and
[57:33] last when the net Caston to see at the
[57:35] end of the world the gospel will attract
[57:37] believers and unbelievers but God's
[57:39] angels separate the wicked away from the
[57:41] holy isn't it interesting on the seventh
[57:43] and final parable Jesus specifically
[57:46] says this is an endtime parable and then
[57:49] brother man come preach it in 1965 the
[57:52] anointed ones at the end time praise God
[57:56] that's the last parable is about how the
[57:59] gospel will attract all kinds of sinners
[58:02] and saints good people bad people why
[58:05] because everybody loves God's anointing
[58:07] I've never I've met so many church
[58:10] people that cut their hair wear makeup
[58:11] wear pants win it and they say when we
[58:14] talk about God I've had so many people
[58:15] tell me oh I got goose bumps when I'm
[58:18] talking about Jesus Church who doesn't
[58:21] like feeling the presence of God do you
[58:24] have your met ever somebody who doesn't
[58:25] like the Friends of God why because it's
[58:27] sweet it's holy it's loving but the
[58:30] thing is you just can't feel the goose
[58:31] buns to say okay now I'll go cut my hair
[58:33] or now I'll go wear makeup or something
[58:35] like that you got to get in the goose
[58:37] bumps and let that guide you to the Word
[58:38] of God amen
[58:40] go wash your face or let your hair grow
[58:42] out or something like that that's you
[58:44] got the goose bumps do to motivate you
[58:46] to inspire you to look to the God of the
[58:49] Bible amen but this right here to me the
[58:53] revelation this is anointed ones the
[58:55] endtime the gospel attracts everybody
[58:58] it'll tract everybody but only but all
[59:02] the ones that are not true trout rainbow
[59:03] trout they all get thrown back they'll
[59:06] get throw back but God's gonna keep all
[59:08] the good ones praise God he's gonna keep
[59:10] you church that's right alright did you
[59:13] know this this is all these were new to
[59:15] me
[59:15] well this one was new to me actually
[59:17] yeah this was already new I preached
[59:18] this one before did you know there are
[59:20] seven gifts in the get in the book of
[59:21] Romans you know this so outside of the
[59:23] nine gifts of the Spirit and outside the
[59:27] fives there's seven other gifts did you
[59:29] know that I didn't know that I'm gonna
[59:31] have to start apply that somehow to my
[59:33] sermons
[59:34] well there's half an hour how did that
[59:35] happen there's the list seven gifts now
[59:39] we already have that gift of prophecies
[59:41] I'm not sure about that but it's a list
[59:43] seven in this context prophecy ministry
[59:47] exhortation isn't it is it interesting
[59:50] how some people just they can encourage
[59:52] anybody that's a gift exhortation is a
[59:57] gift comfort giving is a gift
[1:00:00] some people just have a gift to give
[1:00:02] that's all they know how to do they just
[1:00:04] give and some people have a gift to rule
[1:00:07] over others and then some people have a
[1:00:10] gift of God to show mercy that's where
[1:00:14] we see a lot of women right showing
[1:00:15] mercy as nurses or caregivers they can
[1:00:19] just show mercy when people don't
[1:00:22] deserve it
[1:00:23] they show mercy when other pieces well I
[1:00:26] couldn't put up with that I couldn't
[1:00:27] handle that I just couldn't do that but
[1:00:29] yet some people have so much compassion
[1:00:30] it just moves them to show mercy to
[1:00:32] others I don't appreciate God's gifts
[1:00:36] amen now there's seven listed here
[1:00:38] listed here there is some type of
[1:00:40] overlap right because that's the overlap
[1:00:41] to the nine gifts this is an overlap to
[1:00:44] the fivefold that's the overlap well
[1:00:46] that's overlapped to the fivefold too
[1:00:48] because there they kind of rule the
[1:00:51] church so yeah it's interesting but
[1:00:55] there's seven listed in those three
[1:00:56] scriptures verse six seven eight now
[1:00:58] this is one hour to preach on there are
[1:01:00] seven unities listed in Ephesians four
[1:01:03] there's one body one spirit one hope one
[1:01:06] Lord one faith one baptism and one god
[1:01:09] and father of us all seven unities
[1:01:12] there's that all these are one there
[1:01:15] they're all unified I think that's
[1:01:18] really striking seven of them not now I
[1:01:25] preached this before not long ago I
[1:01:27] think it was about a year ago there are
[1:01:29] seven complete character characteristics
[1:01:31] of wisdom did you know that see but the
[1:01:35] wisdom that is from above is first pure
[1:01:36] so wisdom is always pure there's nothing
[1:01:39] there's no selfish motives in wisdom
[1:01:40] then it's peaceable you'll feel the
[1:01:42] peace of God then it's gentle and easy
[1:01:47] to be intreated it's full of mercy and
[1:01:50] good fruits and it's without partiality
[1:01:54] so when someone really has to get the
[1:01:55] wisdom they're not partial to well I
[1:01:57] like this brother better I like that
[1:01:58] sister better so I'm gonna I'm gonna
[1:02:00] give my advice
[1:02:01] this no it's just impartial just what
[1:02:03] the word says and without hypocrisy so
[1:02:08] nobody's being a hypocrite nobody's
[1:02:09] trying to act like they're a Pharisee or
[1:02:10] a side you see or something that they're
[1:02:13] not right that's wisdom so wisdom has
[1:02:16] seven characteristics so if someone that
[1:02:19] says well have to get the wisdom then
[1:02:20] they have to meet these qualifications
[1:02:22] because that's complete wisdom right
[1:02:24] there that's complete it's finished
[1:02:26] that's wisdom right there all right now
[1:02:31] let's get our Bibles here let's finish
[1:02:32] up here and let's go through the book of
[1:02:34] Hebrews let's look through throw some of
[1:02:35] these these were so such a blessing to
[1:02:37] me as I was studying here this morning
[1:02:40] by God's grace woke up at 5:00 and try
[1:02:42] to get some good studying before work
[1:02:44] today
[1:02:51] all right did you know there's seven
[1:02:54] things that are completely better for us
[1:02:57] in the New Testament according to the
[1:02:58] book of Hebrews there are seven betters
[1:03:02] so let's read these SR in Hebrews 7 how
[1:03:20] many wanna leave out a better Christian
[1:03:21] tonight amen
[1:03:24] I do I'm gonna fall more in love with
[1:03:26] Christ on a girl know his word more I
[1:03:28] want to put I want to take more of what
[1:03:30] I preach and more of what I've read and
[1:03:31] apply it to my life I tell you that that
[1:03:36] situation with this boy in my class has
[1:03:38] really brought me back to a real closer
[1:03:40] walk with the Lord isn't it amazing how
[1:03:42] God uses trials in our lives to draw us
[1:03:44] closer back to him and at the end of it
[1:03:46] we just appreciate the Lord even more
[1:03:48] well thank you lord I don't understand
[1:03:50] it but I know all these things work
[1:03:52] together for my good for the glory of
[1:03:55] God all right
[1:03:57] Bob says we have a better hope now who
[1:03:59] would anyone like to help me read
[1:04:00] tonight here by God's grace a1 Lydia 719
[1:04:11] okay so there has to be grace right so
[1:04:14] grace gives us a better hope than the
[1:04:16] law does hey men searching that
[1:04:20] something all those Saints remember all
[1:04:23] the Saints the Old Testament Saints that
[1:04:24] rose after Jesus rose had a good merit
[1:04:30] in Jerusalem
[1:04:31] maybe you'll come up we've got a better
[1:04:34] hope than the Hat it doesn't matter
[1:04:37] where you buried his body cuz I've
[1:04:39] already buried in Christ amen
[1:04:41] I got a much better hope that's about
[1:04:44] the begging my son maokai bury me in
[1:04:46] jefferson miller bury me he know in
[1:04:48] jerusalem i don't have to say that why
[1:04:52] because i'm already buried in christ

[1:04:59] bones could rot away and die and
[1:05:00] whatever whatever could happen but I've
[1:05:03] got a better hope in Jesus Christ
[1:05:05] thank you Lord all right 7:22 bye so
[1:05:10] much was Jesus made of a surety of a
[1:05:13] better Testament so speaking of the
[1:05:17] Melchizedek Priesthood and we're under a
[1:05:19] better Testament a better covenant amen
[1:05:26] Jesus was made a better covenant for us
[1:05:28] praise God
[1:05:29] alright better promises I like this one
[1:05:32] eighty six but now at the obtained a
[1:05:36] more excellent ministry by how much also
[1:05:40] he's a mediator of a better covenant
[1:05:41] which was established upon better
[1:05:43] promises a man better we all want to get
[1:05:48] better right we all want to do better we
[1:05:51] can't get no better than this phrase God
[1:05:52] amen
[1:05:53] the blood of Jesus Christ the Holy
[1:05:55] Spirit the unconditional covenant of God
[1:05:58] it doesn't get any better than this
[1:06:00] praise God you know that Michigan
[1:06:02] football coach I've heard him saying
[1:06:03] before cuz he used to be on the 49ers he
[1:06:05] said noe they have a cheer at the end of
[1:06:07] every game or practice they say nobody's
[1:06:08] got it better than us well I think I'd
[1:06:10] like to disagree with him because the
[1:06:13] Bible says seven times we've got it
[1:06:15] better than everybody
[1:06:17] Amen nobody's got it better than the
[1:06:20] bride of Jesus Christ amen
[1:06:22] okay what trials we go through it
[1:06:25] our ties this is just light affliction
[1:06:26] our life is but a little vapor
[1:06:29] we've got better promises amen
[1:06:31] hallelujah I guess Jim Harbaugh is that
[1:06:34] Wright brothers and Jim Harbaugh thank
[1:06:36] you the one that says that every year
[1:06:38] they lose to Ohio State so I don't know
[1:06:41] how much better they got it but church
[1:06:44] we're the ones who got it better praise
[1:06:45] the Lord now not because we're better
[1:06:47] but because Christ is better better to
[1:06:50] be on Jesus's side
[1:06:51] all right because we have better
[1:06:53] sacrifices 923 923 it was therefore
[1:07:00] necessary that the patterns of things in
[1:07:02] the heavens should be purified with
[1:07:03] these but the heavenly things themselves
[1:07:05] with better sacrifices than these the
[1:07:09] Jesus Christ's sacrifice is a better
[1:07:11] sacrifice than all the blood of bulls
[1:07:13] and goats amen
[1:07:14] no doubt about that because those those
[1:07:16] things could even they could just for
[1:07:18] cover sins but the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:07:20] abolished sins and it also cleanses all
[1:07:23] the heavens as well the Bible says the
[1:07:25] heavenly things and wrote have said
[1:07:27] that's because when demons are around
[1:07:29] the throne he said it just makes it not
[1:07:31] as clean he said but the blood of Jesus
[1:07:33] Christ one day drive him all out and
[1:07:35] it'll be even heavens will be pure
[1:07:37] purged amen
[1:07:39] that's right 10:34 10:34 Hebrews 10 34
[1:07:45] for he had compassion of me and my bonds
[1:07:48] and took joyfully the spoiling of your
[1:07:50] Goods knowing in yourselves that you
[1:07:52] have in heaven a better and enduring
[1:07:54] substance so Paul saying you gave me
[1:07:59] gifts you gave me natural possessions he
[1:08:02] said but because you gave me your
[1:08:03] natural ones he says you I got your
[1:08:06] possessions but you've got better ones
[1:08:08] ha ha ha praise God that's why I church
[1:08:12] I don't mind giving if I'm low on money
[1:08:14] I said I don't mind giving a little bit
[1:08:16] of money away because you know what I
[1:08:17] got a better promise I got better
[1:08:19] possessions than that race is hard my
[1:08:23] numbers might be going
[1:08:25] [Music]
[1:08:26] my bank account might be good because
[1:08:28] you know that's how life is
[1:08:30] up and down up but even a lot of times I
[1:08:34] know if I see somebody in need my faith
[1:08:37] is dead if I can't help them out hey
[1:08:40] then if you see somebody cold and you
[1:08:43] don't help them out something's wrong
[1:08:44] with our faith if somebody asks you for
[1:08:47] something and you should be able to give
[1:08:49] it to them and hope they don't pay you
[1:08:51] back because you know God's gonna pay
[1:08:53] you back amen
[1:08:54] you don't know how you don't know when
[1:08:56] but he'll do it again he'll pay you back
[1:08:58] because when you lend to the poor you
[1:09:00] lend to the Lord ain't it so Paul says
[1:09:04] you got better possessions in heaven
[1:09:07] I've got your bread I've got your oil
[1:09:10] I've got the the gifts you gave me I got
[1:09:13] the food you gave me the meats he says
[1:09:15] but you've got better possessions
[1:09:16] because you gave to me the Bible says we
[1:09:19] got a better country we're going to
[1:09:21] that's good because I'm tired of the
[1:09:22] United States and all the contradictions
[1:09:25] and the government and all of all the
[1:09:28] troubles on the local level there's
[1:09:30] trouble everywhere we talk about there's
[1:09:32] trouble on every level
[1:09:33] I'm tired of disappointments and and
[1:09:36] promises broken by every president
[1:09:37] breaks the prophecy you know our George
[1:09:40] HW just passing the only thing I
[1:09:42] remember him forwards when he said read
[1:09:44] my lips no new taxes before he got
[1:09:48] elected and then he broke his promise
[1:09:50] and that in that said the church were
[1:09:54] going to a place where the president he
[1:09:55] never breaks his promise whatever he
[1:10:00] says it's gonna happen ain't it you can
[1:10:02] rest your soul on the promises of Jesus
[1:10:05] Christ amen
[1:10:06] that's the country we're going to know
[1:10:08] we were wrong I appreciate that United
[1:10:09] States more than other countries I do
[1:10:11] I appreciate the freedom here but I just
[1:10:13] get tired of seeing sin in fact it makes
[1:10:15] us cry it ought to make us cry we ought
[1:10:19] to sign cry for all the abominations
[1:10:20] done in America day man let's read it 11

[1:15:46] Hebrews there are seven of them once the
[1:15:51] high priest entered once in the holy
[1:15:53] place per year
[1:15:54] Christ appear once to put away sin glory
[1:15:58] it's appointed two men to die once and
[1:16:01] then the judgment Christ once offered to
[1:16:05] bear the sins of many he was offered
[1:16:06] once not many times the Bible said not
[1:16:09] daily like the high priests had to do in
[1:16:11] the Old Testament but once and for all
[1:16:13] he was offered the worshipers once
[1:16:16] purged should have had no conscious of
[1:16:18] sin so he was showing how once wasn't
[1:16:20] good enough for the Old Testament God
[1:16:22] will shake heaven oath once more amen
[1:16:25] haha and then the Bible says the next
[1:16:29] verse and this word yet once more will
[1:16:32] he give to the people so he repeats it
[1:16:33] once more amen God's going to shake all
[1:16:36] things heaven earth now church do you
[1:16:38] know what the Bible says there when God
[1:16:40] takes everything all that's not on Jesus
[1:16:42] falls but all those who are in Jesus
[1:16:44] they stand on the rock amen that's just
[1:16:48] like the world you know I saw that out
[1:16:50] in Japan you know last time Japan had a
[1:16:51] major earthquake there's a big report
[1:16:53] about some of the buildings stood
[1:16:54] because they were shockproof buildings
[1:16:57] oh that's what Jesus did when he sent
[1:16:59] the Holy Ghost to you he gave you a
[1:17:01] shockproof foundation amen all of us
[1:17:04] shake and all the earthquakes all the
[1:17:05] storms all the howling winds are saying
[1:17:08] can never put you off your foundation
[1:17:10] because you got a shockproof foundation
[1:17:12] a holiday up and you're not gonna fall
[1:17:15] it's not
[1:17:16] follow order it's not gonna fall apart
[1:17:19] it's not gonna be destroyed

[1:17:22] you're established on the rock Jesus
[1:17:24] Christ amen thank you lord amen
[1:17:28] I can't fall I can't go back in the
[1:17:30] world because I'm founded on a rock amen
[1:17:33] hallelujah because you know the author
[1:17:36] of that earthquake is the one that built
[1:17:38] my foundation so he knows how the heavy
[1:17:41] that he knows how bad that earthquake
[1:17:43] seemed to me you know how high it's
[1:17:45] going to go on the Richter scale whether
[1:17:47] 7.0 8.0 probably 7.0 because it's
[1:17:50] completion right probably 7.0 but he
[1:17:52] knew that he's I've got to build a
[1:17:54] foundation that Jesse can stand it's got
[1:17:56] a wish stand the shock so I'm not going
[1:17:58] to give him a earthquake he can't handle
[1:18:00] Amen I'm gonna build this foundation on
[1:18:04] my word hey man thank you Lord once and
[1:18:08] for all there seven once and for all
[1:18:11] well I'm so glad about that I'm so glad
[1:18:13] I worried about that last shaking
[1:18:14] because even if I even if things shake
[1:18:17] I'm still gonna stand did you know there
[1:18:21] are seven let us now this is what we
[1:18:22] could use help with church right here

[1:18:27] do this now remember these three are all
[1:18:29] in that part about gather more come to
[1:18:31] church more as you see that day
[1:18:32] approaching all these are in that same
[1:18:34] portion because verse 24 and 25 it says
[1:18:37] we're gather more as you see the Day
[1:18:38] approaching so it says let us draw near
[1:18:41] with a true heart we need to say God
[1:18:44] help me to come to church every time
[1:18:46] with a true heart I don't want to
[1:18:49] falsely come and and try to have some
[1:18:51] ulterior motive on coming to church my
[1:18:54] whole brother Aaron brings food tonight
[1:18:56] and if so boy we're gonna eat all I'm
[1:18:58] the first in line yeah well I wonder
[1:19:02] what to preach I'm just gonna try it
[1:19:03] like we've had people come here Church
[1:19:05] before that have come here just to find
[1:19:07] fault with my preaching that's only
[1:19:09] reason they came to church to find fault
[1:19:11] with brother Branham and they've told me
[1:19:12] that so I'm not making it up they've
[1:19:14] told me that they came they gathered not
[1:19:17] with the true heart they gathered with
[1:19:20] the wrong heart because they came to
[1:19:23] find fault then when they couldn't stand
[1:19:25] it anymore about my preaching then they
[1:19:27] stopped coming or they thought they
[1:19:29] found fault with me or brother
[1:19:30] they leave they found the faults they
[1:19:32] won to find that's not a true heart let
[1:19:36] us hold fast the profession of our faith
[1:19:39] hold it fast let's not let's not say
[1:19:43] something different let's always say
[1:19:44] what the word says let us consider one
[1:19:47] another on this consider means to look
[1:19:49] closely upon so I'm gonna consider
[1:19:50] sister Connie I gotta look real closely
[1:19:53] at her and that's what the Bible says
[1:19:56] when we come together you got to look at
[1:19:57] other people and see how they're feeling
[1:19:59] you gotta be able to look and see oh do
[1:20:02] they feel good today or do they need
[1:20:03] prayer we're supposed to look at other
[1:20:05] people and consider them how we might
[1:20:08] provoke them and that just means inspire
[1:20:10] them maybe that means saying oh do you
[1:20:14] need any money or can you need any
[1:20:16] prayer
[1:20:17] how are things going this week do you
[1:20:19] have a good week in the Lord how's your
[1:20:21] family doing you got to look at people
[1:20:23] and consider them let us consider other
[1:20:26] people how we can inspire them praise
[1:20:30] the Lord now search sometimes I'll get
[1:20:33] to this maybe on the next time I preach
[1:20:34] well you can inspire people by singing a
[1:20:36] special you can inspire people by
[1:20:38] testifying my sister Connie our sister
[1:20:41] Beatrice has such a fiery fiery
[1:20:43] testimony praise the Lord that's gonna
[1:20:45] really inspire me to go pray for this
[1:20:47] situation in my life
[1:20:49] and honestly Church that's what God
[1:20:51] wants God wants you and I to inspire one
[1:20:55] another I see I felt inspired to tell
[1:20:58] that little testimony about my failure
[1:21:00] today and I just prayed God let me make
[1:21:02] it right I felt inspired to share that
[1:21:03] hope that inspires you because that God
[1:21:05] knows I wanted to make it right God
[1:21:07] knows I didn't mean to say that I was
[1:21:09] just in this in the flesh but the Holy
[1:21:11] Spirit helped me get out of the flesh
[1:21:13] hey man let us lay aside every way and
[1:21:17] run the race with perseverance let us do
[1:21:20] that let bride of Christ do that let us
[1:21:23] have grace to serve God accept ibly not
[1:21:27] law let us have grace now that doesn't
[1:21:31] mean we don't obey the word but it
[1:21:32] doesn't mean we don't we don't quit or
[1:21:34] we don't we don't bash somebody if they
[1:21:36] just make one mistake cuz I just told
[1:21:38] you about my mistake tonight right let
[1:21:42] us go
[1:21:43] forth under him I love this without the
[1:21:44] camp go outside of the RET the heat he
[1:21:47] was saying Jesus had to go outside the
[1:21:48] camp he had to go outside of Jerusalem
[1:21:50] in other words brother Hamza preaches
[1:21:52] that and he says it's spiritually we've
[1:21:54] got to go outside denomination we've got
[1:21:56] to go outside man-made tradition we've
[1:21:58] got to go outside of anything that's not
[1:22:00] a pleasing to God
[1:22:01] we've got to go outside we've got to
[1:22:03] leave that let us go out of that and go
[1:22:05] to the word Christ and let us by him I
[1:22:11] love this offer the sacrifice of praise
[1:22:13] by our lips I hope that's your prayer
[1:22:15] Church I hope when you come in here you
[1:22:16] say lord help me to worship you with
[1:22:19] your help because the Bible says by him
[1:22:23] Jesus helped me to worship you because
[1:22:26] doctors
[1:22:29] except you burped I don't worship with
[1:22:31] Jesse Smith spirit because that won't do
[1:22:33] me any good I've got a worship by his
[1:22:35] help by his spirit how many when worship
[1:22:38] like that amen
[1:22:40] but RAM said you are supposed to be a
[1:22:42] participant in the feeling of the Holy
[1:22:44] Spirit in the church in other words I
[1:22:48] shouldn't be or just one of you
[1:22:49] shouldn't be the only one who feels
[1:22:52] excited about God or feels like they
[1:22:54] love God we've all got to participate in
[1:22:57] that us a God by you let me offer the
[1:23:01] sacrifice of praise for my lips seven
[1:23:07] let us seven I think that's good for our
[1:23:10] church wouldn't it be great if everybody
[1:23:11] the church all did this wouldn't be
[1:23:14] great if everybody in the message did
[1:23:15] that let us it's us it's for us it's for
[1:23:18] a group of believers to do this all
[1:23:22] right did you know there are seven
[1:23:23] eternal things in the book of Hebrews
[1:23:25] this just keeps going on and on this
[1:23:27] that's why I was saying this book is
[1:23:29] eternal church this is an eternal book
[1:23:31] and here it is eternal the Bible says
[1:23:34] there's eternal salvation
[1:23:35] there's eternal judgment now didn't say
[1:23:37] burn eternally it just said that
[1:23:39] judgment lasts like brother Jason preach
[1:23:40] that judgment will last for eternity and
[1:23:43] those who are judged as sinners they're
[1:23:45] that judgment is going to last in other
[1:23:47] words they're gonna be annihilated
[1:23:48] though they'll never exist anymore but
[1:23:50] the judgment upon them will stand
[1:23:52] forever or eternally but God's mercy on
[1:23:57] judging us will be still standing
[1:23:58] eternally as well Melchizedek is eternal
[1:24:01] because he's without beginning of days
[1:24:03] or ending of life he's eternal Christ
[1:24:06] has the power of an endless life eternal
[1:24:08] life
[1:24:08] there's eternal redemption and the Bible
[1:24:11] said we do not grieve the Eternal Spirit
[1:24:13] of God and the Bible says we have an
[1:24:16] eternal inheritance amen
[1:24:18] no you might get an earthly inheritance
[1:24:20] on the earth but eventually is going to
[1:24:22] run out but with Jesus his inheritance
[1:24:24] is never gonna run out that's yeah amen
[1:24:28] that's the best inheritance I could ask
[1:24:29] for praise God I know I'm really gonna
[1:24:32] get nothing from my mom or dad and
[1:24:33] that's fine but as long as I get that
[1:24:35] eternal inheritance that's all the
[1:24:37] cattle tape it on the new you
[1:24:38] and again I'm not going for fours just
[1:24:41] give me
[1:24:42] just lay at his feet for a thousand
[1:24:43] years let me just be there with Jesus
[1:24:45] Christ I'm not I'm not begging I'm not
[1:24:48] competing
[1:24:49] I'm just saying Lord Jesus let me be
[1:24:50] faithful and let me just inherit eternal
[1:24:52] life
[1:24:53] if anything comes out for that that's
[1:24:54] just icing on the cake but of course I
[1:24:57] want to be sanctified of course okay I
[1:25:00] got five minutes yeah five minutes did
[1:25:04] you know now we're finally outside of
[1:25:05] Hebrews are you happy about that what a
[1:25:08] great book there's seven firstfruits
[1:25:10] mention in the Bible the first fruits of
[1:25:15] the Holy Spirit he said both Jew and
[1:25:17] Gentile Romans 8:23 so the day of
[1:25:19] Pentecost right there's firstfruits of
[1:25:23] the bride tree in Romans 11 16 which is
[1:25:25] referring to these now this is this is
[1:25:28] what I like there's firstfruits of the
[1:25:30] city of a ki and one of the man's name
[1:25:33] was at pnts or the first believers the
[1:25:42] Christians Christ on Sarno Christ is the
[1:25:44] firstfruits of them that slept so Jesus
[1:25:47] is that first fruit wave offering amen
[1:25:50] everybody says the brother branham but I
[1:25:52] just heard brother bam say it's the
[1:25:53] message the word the message is way
[1:25:56] before the people praise God the first
[1:25:59] one they come to maturity is Christ and
[1:26:02] the Bible said Christ is the firstfruits
[1:26:04] of them that slept he's their
[1:26:06] firstfruits he's the first one that's
[1:26:08] mature praise God amen the Bible also
[1:26:13] says it which is interesting a ki
[1:26:15] Stefano says house was also these
[1:26:17] firstfruits the first Christian in that
[1:26:20] city was epic epic to need us so I'm not
[1:26:24] saying that right and it's the finest
[1:26:25] they're the firstfruits now this made me
[1:26:27] shout last year I may not get excited
[1:26:29] this year but church I'm the firstfruits
[1:26:31] of Akron hallelujah I received the
[1:26:36] message in Akron and I'm a pastor dacron

[1:26:41] the message inaccurate hey how did he
[1:26:44] have raised God I am the firstfruits and
[1:26:47] if you got saved in Akron and got the
[1:26:49] Holy Ghost and a cure to God we receive
[1:26:51] the message in Akron
[1:26:52] then you're part of the firstfruits of
[1:26:53] Akron June you might be man
[1:26:56] that's okay it's a good as place as any
[1:26:58] any place where you're a first fruit any
[1:27:01] place where you've got the baptism holy
[1:27:03] ghost is a good place to be
[1:27:05] hey man we probably got first fruits of

[1:27:10] sister Beatrice first fruit of Ghana
[1:27:12] yeah amen thank you no hard amen

[1:27:20] believer or one of the first group of a
[1:27:23] move there you got the Holy Ghost here
[1:27:25] one of the first fruits that's the word
[1:27:29] now the believers are firstfruits of his
[1:27:31] creatures which are the new creation
[1:27:33] Jesus was the beginning of the creation
[1:27:36] of God and so he was the beginning were
[1:27:39] the end amen and we appreciate this last
[1:27:44] Wednesday night revelation 14 the
[1:27:46] 144,000 are the firstfruits unto God so
[1:27:49] after the Gentile branch is cut off God
[1:27:53] grafts in the Israel branch and then the
[1:27:56] 144,000 are the firstfruits that come
[1:27:58] out of that branch amen were the last
[1:28:01] fruits right who are the last ones on
[1:28:04] that layer see a branch that is cut off
[1:28:06] after you harvest those and then he gets
[1:28:08] the firstfruits the 144,000 oh thank you
[1:28:12] lord
[1:28:12] let's I'm closer with this I'm going
[1:28:14] right here that's the last ones I'm
[1:28:15] gonna do did you know this there are
[1:28:18] seven blessings in the book of
[1:28:19] Revelation 7 the book of Revelation says
[1:28:23] blessing seven times
[1:28:30] come on you if you and I obey the Word
[1:28:34] of God amen
[1:28:36] because hearers are not justified
[1:28:40] churchgoers are not blessed it's those
[1:28:43] who take what the church says and lives
[1:28:45] it Hey look it look what it says now
[1:28:48] look I put the whole scriptures up here
[1:28:50] so I'm not going to paraphrase bless it
[1:28:52] he that readeth and then hear the words
[1:28:54] of prophecy and then that keep those
[1:28:57] things that are written there and so
[1:28:59] there's one for keeping and doing the
[1:29:01] Word of God and I heard a voice from
[1:29:02] heaven saying unto me blessed are the
[1:29:04] Dead which die in the Lord branch forth
[1:29:06] yay say the spirit that they met or a
[1:29:08] rest from their labors and their works
[1:29:09] to follow them so that one doesn't say
[1:29:11] specifically but it does talk about good
[1:29:13] works number three behold I come as a
[1:29:17] key as a thief sorry blessed is he that
[1:29:20] watches and keeps his garments lest he
[1:29:23] walk naked and they see his shame
[1:29:25] keeping the word keeping clean number
[1:29:29] four and he said to me write blessed are
[1:29:31] they which are called the marriage
[1:29:32] supper of the Lamb and he said to me
[1:29:33] these are the true sayings of God now
[1:29:35] you know the scripture the bride has to
[1:29:37] do what make herself ready so that
[1:29:40] really counts she has to make herself
[1:29:43] ready the next one blessed and holy is
[1:29:46] he that hath part in the first
[1:29:47] resurrection on such the second death
[1:29:50] has no power they shall be priests of
[1:29:52] God in Christ and shall reign with him a
[1:29:53] thousand years we already got four right
[1:29:55] here it is the last one right no there's
[1:29:59] two more behold I come quickly blessed
[1:30:03] is he that keepeth the sayings of the
[1:30:05] prophecy of this book amen

[1:46:49] and he got so happy he went and bought
[1:46:52] August he had like eight children went
[1:46:54] and bought them all ice cream and they
