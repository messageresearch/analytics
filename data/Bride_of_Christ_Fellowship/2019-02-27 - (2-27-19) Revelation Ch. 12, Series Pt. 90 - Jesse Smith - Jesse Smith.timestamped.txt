[21:37] with different things well the same
[21:39] thing but let's just pray this time it's
[21:43] a real victory like brother man preached
[21:46] from that time on you know that and I
[21:49] said that text on Monday morning I said
[21:51] you know Jesus said he told the demon to
[21:53] leave and never enter again and I told
[21:56] him I'm praying that for him
[21:57] amen I believe we've got the authority
[22:00] like we saw we don't have the power but
[22:02] we've got the authority through the
[22:05] blood of Jesus Christ yes he kept his
[22:17] word amen thank you Jesus
[22:22] raise god amen praise the Lord Amen
[22:33] hallelujah

[22:40] Jessica that he'd get baptized if he
[22:43] passed through fireman school was that
[22:45] right and he passed through all of it so
[22:52] God knows you know God knows and you
[22:54] know there's numerous people in the
[22:55] Bible that made vows to God right and
[22:57] when God to answer their prayer you got
[23:00] to keep your part so that's wonderful
[23:02] that proves to him that God is real and
[23:05] God heard his prayers amen may God
[23:07] continue may God add to that faith he's
[23:09] got faith may God add hurt you and build
[23:12] him up so you can receive the full
[23:15] promises of God beautiful also I put my
[23:18] brother Paul Smith he's my youngest
[23:20] brother
[23:21] he and I talked Saturday and there he
[23:23] just asked for wisdom you know he's in a
[23:25] certain position on the job and then
[23:27] he's got desires to you know do things
[23:29] for the Lord so I told him I said lift
[23:31] him up in a word prayer so that's the
[23:33] stuff my brother he does go to cam
[23:35] Church so let's just pray for him
[23:39] tonight any other requests tonight I
[23:42] think the Lord well I'm just so happy
[23:44] they're so happy God is so good God did
[23:48] a little I don't know if you knew but
[23:49] God did a little bit of a miracle a
[23:51] little healing on Sunday night sister
[23:53] who Oh was sick all all week and while
[23:57] we were singing he is here hallelujah
[23:59] there's a nice anointing in here on
[24:01] Sunday night and sister Naomi let out a
[24:06] scream in the spirit you remember that
[24:08] sister Naomi and at that moment did who
[24:11] would tell you she did okay Oh Adam told
[24:15] you okay praise the Lord at that moment
[24:18] the very moment our sister was screaming
[24:20] the spirit a warm wind came in I guess
[24:24] and struck sister hua and instantly she
[24:28] said Oliver pain vanished right there by
[24:30] the grace of Lord so we thank the Lord
[24:32] for that phrase doc thank you Jesus so
[24:38] we thank the Lord that the Russian
[24:40] mighty wind still comes in here right
[24:42] though comes amongst believers so I'm
[24:45] very thankful for that you know two
[24:46] years ago sister SIA said she heard
[24:48] angels singing in here last Sunday night
[24:51] holy wind came in here this is a great
[24:53] place to be wherever two or three are
[24:57] gathered there I am in the midst of them
[24:58] so we're thankful for that by the grace
[25:00] of God I decided share that that's
[25:03] encouraging you know to know that
[25:05] despite our failures you know and our
[25:07] our faults and our mistakes you know the
[25:09] Lord looks past that and he sees our
[25:11] needs so we're very very thankful for
[25:14] the Lord Jesus Christ and I told Malachi
[25:16] in the car said I said that's wonderful
[25:18] I said I've never felt a win before you
[25:20] know I'm glad I've never heard of angels
[25:22] before but I believe it's happening I
[25:25] have been healed in service I told
[25:27] Malachi
[25:27] I was preaching at the old place and my
[25:30] neck just seized up I couldn't move my
[25:32] neck and so I said let's close and word
[25:33] of Prayer didn't tell anybody
[25:35] just laid my hands as I prayed and I
[25:37] felt this warm sensation and it came
[25:39] upon my neck and I couldn't move it and
[25:42] all of a sudden it just started
[25:43] evaporating I just felt this warm Holy
[25:46] Spirit presence it's are evaporating and
[25:47] then all of a sudden I could feel I
[25:49] could move my neck and everything was
[25:50] good
[25:51] so I have felt that and the main thing
[25:55] to do is that we just want to feel God's
[25:57] presence however hover way we can
[26:01] however he allows us and so we're so
[26:04] thankful for God's mercy let's bow our

[35:04] lord thank you lord
[35:06] all praise is due to that reason Lord
[35:14] let's take our Bibles here tonight by
[35:16] God's grace I like to go to Revelation
[35:18] chapter 12 I appreciate it to Wednesdays
[35:20] ago I like to finish that chapter
[35:21] tonight by God's grace oh one more thing
[35:32] I did
[35:33] ferm brother Brian Hawkins will be here
[35:34] with us on March 31st by God's grace oh
[35:37] I'll be preaching all the Sundays up
[35:38] until then by God's grace that gives me
[35:42] a one two three four Sundays in a row
[35:45] and well take a little break there on
[35:47] the 31st and just so you know as you're
[35:49] turning to Revelation 12 I did ask
[35:50] brother Brian if if it'd be okay if his
[35:54] son preached this the evening service
[35:57] so his sons 18 his name's David and he's
[36:00] been a real faithful little boy now he's
[36:02] a young man and he's been preaching for
[36:05] two or three years he just preaches
[36:06] they're at their home church but I like
[36:08] to give you know young ministers a
[36:09] chance to preach so just so you know
[36:11] that Sunday night you know I'd like to
[36:13] have a minister he probably nervous it's
[36:16] probably the first time he's preached
[36:17] outside of his home church but I
[36:19] wouldn't be preaching unless opportunity
[36:22] to preach that was brother Brooks you
[36:25] know so without that invite I probably
[36:27] wouldn't be here today so I'm very
[36:29] thankful for that and so I like to give
[36:31] young ministers a chance to preach it
[36:32] and just as you've noticed in years past
[36:34] I've allowed different ones to preach
[36:36] and maybe they don't preach after a
[36:38] while and that's okay because at least
[36:40] we gave them a chance to see if that was
[36:42] God's will for their life and I still
[36:46] have not ordained any preacher that said
[36:49] under me to be a preacher because I just
[36:51] haven't felt led to the Lord to do that
[36:52] I was waiting to see different gifts if
[36:55] they would manifest and then certain
[36:57] things happen you know and you know
[36:59] maybe leaving the church or something
[37:01] like that and and so I just tried to be
[37:04] led of the Lord to do that I the Bible
[37:06] says not lay no I'm sorry lay hands
[37:08] suddenly on no man the Bible says so I
[37:10] want to wait and give that a person an
[37:14] opportunity to see if they're called of
[37:15] God to preach and if I've seen a gift in
[37:19] someone's life and they were sitting
[37:21] under my ministry I would certainly
[37:22] ordain that but if I'm not sure I just
[37:26] got to wait on it and see what God
[37:28] allows I feel like if there's a gift in
[37:31] that person's life then they will live
[37:34] they will live that word fully and
[37:37] brother Branham gives us a three-fold
[37:38] evidence in the church age book about
[37:40] preachers they have to follow that
[37:42] pattern and so that's how I do it here
[37:46] at this church I
[37:47] have an ordained anybody but that you
[37:49] know that that's how I do it by God's
[37:50] grace so maybe that'll clear up some of
[37:52] your questions from the past so
[37:55] Revelation chapter 12 verse 1 now
[38:07] usually don't wear dark colors like red
[38:08] but today was wear red day at work you
[38:10] know so I had to wear red yes I like to
[38:14] wear more plain colors like you know
[38:15] blue or white or yellow or something
[38:17] like and as you look like wearing bright
[38:21] red but you know well okay I'll wear the
[38:24] red if they want me over but it does
[38:27] remind me of the red blood of Christ or
[38:29] the scarlet token like scarlet cord
[38:32] already have hung out of the house so
[38:35] Revelation 12 verse 1 for there say Amen
[38:38] let's read verses 1 and 2 we'll all read
[38:43] verse 1 and then I'll read to by myself
[38:44] so let's read verse 1 on three one two
[38:47] three
[38:48] and there appeared a great wonder in
[38:50] heaven a woman clothed with the Sun and
[38:53] the moon under her feet and upon her
[38:56] head a crown of twelve stars and I'll
[38:59] read verse two and she being with child
[39:01] cried travailing in birth and pained to
[39:03] be delivered
[39:05] that's about heads forward of prayer if
[39:07] you have anything on your heart just
[39:08] make an order to God here tonight
[39:11] Heavenly Father my hands are up Lord and
[39:13] father I've certainly have needs here
[39:15] tonight Lord and and father I'm so
[39:17] thankful again for these testimonies of
[39:18] Todd and sister who are Lord it just
[39:20] means so much to me Lord and Lord I just
[39:23] believe these are like signposts Lord
[39:26] showing us we're on the right path to
[39:28] your God and we're so thankful for that
[39:31] Lord you give us those so so we know
[39:33] we're not wandering in darkness or we're
[39:36] not off the beaten path we're not
[39:37] walking the permissive wheel we're
[39:39] walking in the perfect will of God
[39:40] so I thank you for that Lord as I know
[39:42] your prophet prayed and trying to go out
[39:44] of service your prophet pray Lord and
[39:46] every now and then just gives us signs
[39:48] Lord to know that we're still walking
[39:50] with you Lord so I have that same prayer
[39:53] Lord God thank you for those signs that
[39:54] you give us and father I know you're
[39:56] here tonight Lord God you promised to be
[39:59] and father Lord just take
[40:01] break it to our hearts encourage us
[40:03] strengthen us speak to our lives and
[40:05] father will give you all the glory in
[40:07] Jesus Christ's name in the church sent a
[40:09] man god bless you to being seated praise
[40:11] the Lord
[40:18] so we like to look at chapter 12 again I
[40:24] was going to look up that quote if I
[40:26] could find it real quick
[40:36] and I do have some
[40:37] dear Lydia oh yeah here just thank the
[40:42] Lord I found it okay so this is at the
[40:44] end of trying to do God a service
[40:45] brother branham said father he said keep
[40:48] us in these your hands they are yours I
[40:52] pray God that will always walk humble
[40:54] before you we don't know how long do we
[40:57] we make a little bigger
[40:59] I guess the wider we don't know how long
[41:05] we don't desire to know how long it's
[41:07] not our business that's your business
[41:09] it's not our wills to know when you will
[41:11] come
[41:12] it's are we Lord to keep humble till you
[41:15] do come and walk with you it's our
[41:19] desire now look how humble this is this
[41:21] is always stuck with me since I came in
[41:23] the message it's our desire for you to
[41:27] just let yourself be known once in a
[41:30] while father among us that we can see
[41:36] that we're still walking with you in
[41:39] that beautiful
[41:40] you know if sometimes if we're not
[41:42] careful we get discouraged if we don't
[41:43] see a like I know I do sometimes I get
[41:45] discouraged if I don't see a miracle
[41:47] from time to time I told her that a
[41:48] minute I said brother hey man you keep
[41:50] sticking around you hang around this
[41:51] message long enough you're gonna see a
[41:53] miracle and what do you see on Sunday
[41:55] night he finally saw America I told him
[41:59] I said you hang around this word long
[42:00] enough you're gonna see miracles I could
[42:03] retina saw her America amen
[42:06] so she probably had more than that you
[42:08] know but the thing is you just stay
[42:10] faithful to God every once in a while
[42:12] he'll show up to let you know you're
[42:14] still walking the right path oh thank
[42:17] you lord so let's look at a few quotes
[42:20] here I have so a few quotes like to look
[42:22] at this thought here pardon me I want to
[42:29] just real quickly review what we covered
[42:32] two weeks ago and then finish up this
[42:35] chapter Lord willing Lord willing
[42:38] so this is part 90 hard to believe 90
[42:41] sermons remember brother Branham calls
[42:43] us a little heaven he said memorize gone
[42:46] through this quote on numerous times but
[42:47] I just want to remind you this is what
[42:49] mode random wish he could do wish we had
[42:50] about four
[42:51] till January to March or April to put a
[42:55] big canvas back here draw out the
[42:57] pictures drop the whole chart just raise
[43:00] them up and down window shades like I've
[43:02] always dreamed of having a big
[43:03] tabernacle somewhere where I could reach
[43:05] down and pull this chart down come all
[43:07] the way across the platform and
[43:08] revelations and the interpretations Lord
[43:11] has given me and take a pointer and
[43:13] start through there and bring these ages
[43:16] down then when we get through with that
[43:18] raise the one up hold the other one down
[43:19] like this and start on that and teach it
[43:21] through oh that would just be like a
[43:24] little heaven wouldn't it just sit
[43:26] complete winter through just sit I sit
[43:28] it out with our Lord glad to sit it out
[43:30] with the Lord tonight remember Church
[43:32] when when when the pillar of fire came
[43:35] down and made the seven shadows of the
[43:40] church ages across the wall all the
[43:42] awesome Rama doing was preaching on the
[43:44] throne guards of Revelation chapter four
[43:46] it wasn't a wasn't a sermon that even
[43:49] said thus saith the Lord and he was just
[43:51] teaching on the revelations that the
[43:53] Holy Spirit gave him after the church
[43:54] age sermons a few weeks after that and
[43:57] and the Holy Spirit showed those shadows
[44:01] or the lights rather he sold the showed
[44:04] those seven shadows on the back if you
[44:07] if I was at the pulpit of Branham
[44:08] Tabernacle they showed us is the back
[44:10] left corner so that that's where the the
[44:14] nursery used to be and so the man showed
[44:17] me and I asked him I said he pointed out
[44:18] right there is the back left-hand corner
[44:21] so for us to be like hanging right over
[44:22] where Lydia was if you like right back
[44:24] there that's where the Holy Spirit
[44:26] showed the light and the shadows when
[44:29] brother Anne was preaching after you got
[44:31] done preaching the Church ages and this
[44:32] was that exact quote I used to play the
[44:35] audio I had the audio but couldn't find
[44:36] it he said how many six in the room
[44:39] looked this way now he said now that's
[44:43] just like it is when it comes under
[44:44] glory now at this point remember they're
[44:46] all screaming and shouting I played it
[44:47] for you numerous times he says that's
[44:50] just like it is when it comes in glory
[44:51] here see it's the light over here you're
[44:54] moving here you see now look it's just
[44:56] it's just a reflection just a reflection
[44:58] that's that is see it's not the light
[45:00] here's the light hang in here right here
[45:02] see right here at this woman
[45:05] I just happen to catch it I thought it
[45:06] was over somebody now you're seeing one
[45:09] of them and I'm seeing two so the people
[45:11] saw the light in the back what brother
[45:13] branham sees the light up here too so
[45:16] they're seeing the natural light and
[45:18] brother branham is seeing the pillar of
[45:20] fire light amen
[45:22] he said you're seeing one I'm seeing two
[45:26] Cory
[45:28] one of them is natural the other one is
[45:30] supernatural there's a man sitting on
[45:33] the outside here along this line looking
[45:35] over towards that light it struck him
[45:36] he's from Seymour Indiana he had a
[45:38] stroke I believe sir God will give you
[45:40] that stroke amen believe now do you
[45:43] believe with all your heart
[45:44] you're not wonderful to know that on
[45:46] Sunday night the Holts with same holy
[45:48] spirit swept down in here and healed our
[45:50] sister and that great to know now it
[45:53] doesn't matter to me whether he sweeps
[45:54] in here like a wind or whether he
[45:56] appears as a pillar of fire or he speaks
[45:59] in tongues and prophesies doesn't matter
[46:02] as long as he's here amen
[46:06] now let's look at chapter 12 again now
[46:11] well remember said revelation 12 does
[46:13] not pertain to the bride this has
[46:15] nothing to do with the bride he says is
[46:19] the woman standing in the Sun with the
[46:20] moon under feet the moon represented the
[46:22] law the woman represented Israel the
[46:24] church and the twelve stars in her
[46:26] forehead was those twelve apostles 12
[46:29] Church ages and so forth which was just
[46:31] passed and the Sun was at her head which
[46:33] you see that moon is a shadow of the Sun
[46:35] which the law was a shadow of good
[46:37] things that come and that woman is
[46:39] Israel not the bride and here's that
[46:43] great quote where it explains how what
[46:45] the moon means and look the moon under
[46:47] her the Sun at her head the moon under
[46:49] her feet the Sun was a dispensation of
[46:51] grace the moon was the dispensation of
[46:54] law the woman was the Orthodox Church
[46:56] the Jewish church and was standing over
[46:58] the law the law was passing away because
[47:01] the law was a shadow of good things to
[47:03] come is that right
[47:05] the moon is only a shadow of the Sun
[47:07] reflecting in the moon making the moon
[47:08] and the law was under feet she doesn't
[47:11] live through that day and notice how she
[47:12] was dressed here all right
[47:19] now let's read in our Bible and I'll try
[47:20] to catch up where we left off here yeah
[47:28] we left off member we left off with the
[47:29] rod of I remember that and I was
[47:30] wondering did I say that wrong was I
[47:32] wrong on that but no the Jesus says he
[47:35] he will give overcomers a rod of iron
[47:37] that's right in the Millenium because
[47:40] they'll be ruling over cities they'll be
[47:41] ruling over peoples they'll be ruling
[47:44] over a whole worldwide group of people
[47:46] and think about how many people will be
[47:48] born during the Millennium I don't know
[47:50] where those people come from do they
[47:52] make it over somehow through the
[47:54] Armageddon battle and through the I
[47:56] don't know or is God gonna give people
[47:58] another chance that live that never had
[48:00] a chance to hear Christ we don't know
[48:01] but the Bible said there will be
[48:03] children born and a child will lead a
[48:06] lie and I believe it for not mistake it
[48:08] was a lion a child will lead a lion or
[48:10] and the Bible said there'll be no sin
[48:14] for a thousand years remember that
[48:17] what's striking is that at the end of
[48:19] the thousand years this is striking to
[48:21] me at the other Satan is loosed for a
[48:24] little season and he deceives all those
[48:27] on the earth and can you imagine that
[48:31] that these people that live here for a
[48:33] thousand years they watch these
[48:35] righteous sons and daughters of God amen
[48:37] that's you and I praise God they watch
[48:40] these rulers rule with the rod of iron
[48:42] and around around the earth rule over
[48:45] cities and the watch sees a Holy Ghost
[48:47] filled a glorified body Saints rule and
[48:50] then somehow after a thousand years
[48:52] Satan will deceive them to come against
[48:55] us at Jerusalem can you imagine that
[48:58] that's striking you ever thought about
[49:00] that it just goes to show without the
[49:03] Holy Ghost
[49:04] you can meet a sea very quickly by Satan
[49:06] without I mean they would they would
[49:09] have a thousand years of testimonies are
[49:10] saying well ruler Aaron did this good
[49:13] this good disc it you hate you're never
[49:15] gonna sin for a thousand years you're
[49:18] gonna have quite a testimony praise the
[49:19] Lord you have quite a list of
[49:21] accomplishments right like the president
[49:24] can say well he's had these
[49:24] accomplishments on Wall Street and he
[49:26] could have a list of accomplishments
[49:28] right but in there are some mistakes too
[49:31] because we're a fall
[49:33] but not in the Millennium amen the Holy
[49:36] Ghost receipts will have no mistakes in
[49:38] the Millennium amen
[49:39] it only be a list a real long list of
[49:43] great decisions for a thousand years and
[49:46] think at the end of all that they'll
[49:49] still be deceived against you and I but
[49:52] that's where the Bible says that we'll
[49:53] have the rod of iron that's where the
[49:55] Bible said that God will come and rescue
[49:57] us amen
[49:58] although Jerusalem will be encompassed
[50:01] by this big group God will send down
[50:04] fire and fire will destroy our enemies
[50:06] amen the same things true today the word
[50:08] is like a fire that destroys our enemies
[50:11] amen hallelujah
[50:12] the Bible said there'll be a wall of
[50:14] fire around us what is it it's God
[50:16] always protecting his bride amen oh
[50:19] thank the Lord what a what a wonderful
[50:21] blessing not so we left off at verse 5 I
[50:26] believe now let me just read verse 1 and
[50:28] 2 again there Peter great wonder in
[50:31] heaven a woman that's the Orthodox
[50:33] Jewish Church right before Christ was
[50:35] born clothed with the Sun and he said
[50:38] that was the grace that was the the
[50:40] covenant of grace amen and that
[50:42] scripture because Jesus when he appeared
[50:44] transformed the Bible said his
[50:46] righteousness shone like the Sun and the
[50:50] Bible said Jesus was full of grace and
[50:52] truth amen haha full of grace that light
[50:56] a sunlight of grace God's grace and the
[50:59] moon the law was under her feet so she
[51:03] was that was passing away it's under her
[51:05] feet she's about ready to pass given the
[51:07] opportunity to pass in the greats and
[51:10] upon her head was a crowd twelve stars
[51:13] twelve representing the 12 tribes of
[51:15] Israel and she being with child cried
[51:17] speaking of Christ Christ came out of
[51:20] the lineage of David right out of the
[51:22] the Orthodox people travailing in birth
[51:26] and pained to be delivered verse three
[51:30] and there appeared another wonder in
[51:31] heaven and behold a great sir lost much
[51:35] man a great red dragon Satan having
[51:39] seven heads those seven hills
[51:41] yeahright the seven hills of Rome and
[51:44] the ten horns and then
[51:46] ten horns member of the ten tyrants or
[51:49] dictators are going to rise up for the
[51:51] woman with the woman rather in the
[51:54] tribulation and seven Crown's upon his
[51:57] heads and his tail drew the third part
[52:02] of the stars the heavens that gives us a
[52:04] clue that a third of the Angels were to
[52:08] see by Satan now think about that church
[52:11] what is a third of infinity because the
[52:17] Bible said there's an innumerable number
[52:19] of angels now I'm just throwing that out
[52:22] there that's kind of an interesting
[52:23] thought isn't it
[52:24] about said there's innumerable ange so
[52:26] it's you can't number that they're so
[52:28] great but a third of this innumerable
[52:30] number followed Satan so there must be
[52:34] some number there just must be
[52:36] innumerable to you and I that's what it
[52:38] must be I'd imagine
[52:41] all right No so now verse that's first
[52:45] four and did cast them to the earth so
[52:47] now these demons are cast to the earth
[52:49] and the dragon stood before the woman
[52:50] which was ready to be delivered for to
[52:54] devour her child Jesus as soon as it was
[52:57] born
[52:57] right so all those demon powers were on
[53:00] the earth remember they got cast out of
[53:02] heaven
[53:03] remember that strike it isn't that
[53:04] striking about Lucifer and his angels
[53:06] it's striking because they were living
[53:09] in heaven but they get cast out of
[53:11] heaven but they're then they're allowed
[53:13] to come back there and argue with God
[53:15] about who's holy and who's just right
[53:17] like job in that striking so that shows
[53:20] that they're home they're no longer
[53:21] allowed to dwell there but they aren't
[53:23] allowed to come back to a heavenly
[53:26] courtroom oh aren't you glad that when
[53:29] Satan's they're accusing you before the
[53:31] throne of God aren't you glad you have a
[53:33] lawyer there praise the Lord aren't you
[53:35] glad you've got an advocate there with
[53:38] the father hallelujah amen Jesus Christ
[53:41] the righteous amen and if you repent of
[53:44] your sins and trust in the blood then
[53:46] Jesus will tell him the same thing he
[53:49] told Satan was Satan was accusing Joshua
[53:52] the high priest he says the Lord rebuke
[53:54] you amen hi there yeah let's see we've
[53:57] got to get our sins under the blood
[53:59] we got to confess and say I'm sorry
[54:01] forgive me I prepared and then the Lord
[54:04] can say there's this nerves no evidence
[54:06] there it's forgiven
[54:07] I've forgiven it don't bring it up I
[54:09] rebuke you amen okay what a promise amen
[54:14] my what a courtroom that is when the
[54:17] judge gets rid of all the evidence amen
[54:19] that's the kind of courtroom I want to
[54:21] be hid where any evidence against me is
[54:24] put away under the brunt in Christ and
[54:26] it will never be found again amen
[54:29] there's no record of it there's no way
[54:31] he can pull up that evidence anymore oh
[54:34] thank you lord hallelujah right verse
[54:41] five all right now this is where we
[54:42] ended and she brought forth the man
[54:44] child that's Christ
[54:45] who was to rule all nations with a rod
[54:47] of iron he must have the major rod and
[54:49] we must have minor or maybe it's just
[54:50] figurative speech I don't know but he
[54:52] did say revelation 2 then the Thyatira
[54:55] church age he'll give you a rod of iron
[54:57] to the overcomer now and her child was
[55:02] caught up unto God to the throne so in
[55:04] this verse you have all of Jesus Christ
[55:06] life for thirty three and a half years
[55:08] or thirty three years rather so he's
[55:11] born he's crucified he resurrects and
[55:15] he's caught up to the throne of God amen
[55:19] that's all verse 5 what a striking verse
[55:22] now verse 6 now I think I have ok I'm in
[55:30] the wrong spot let me get the right spot
[55:31] on my notes here thank you for
[55:37] patience I'm on verse six here we are
[55:42] alright verse six now we know verse six
[55:47] now verse six now in verse six the
[55:49] fleeing of the woman is Israel fleeing
[55:52] into the wilderness and this represents
[55:56] that the Jews rejected their Messiah and
[55:59] were broken off from the life of Christ
[56:02] in the New Testament okay so it's
[56:06] reverse 6 and the woman fled into the
[56:07] wilderness where she had the place
[56:09] prepared for God aren't you can't you
[56:11] see God's mercy in this scripture
[56:13] although they reject his Messiah that he
[56:16] even brought through the mother trip she
[56:18] didn't bring it outside in the Gentiles
[56:20] he actually brought his own son the
[56:22] right way through the sea line of David
[56:24] he was sent to his own his own received
[56:26] not and even though they rejected him
[56:29] God still said I'll give you a place of
[56:32] grace amen
[56:33] hurry up praise God other words I'm not
[56:36] done with you I'll bring you back amen
[56:38] oh that's a place of grace where she has
[56:42] a place prepared of God so God prepared
[56:44] her a place of grace now we know where
[56:46] that place is
[56:47] it's under the altar of God it's the
[56:49] fish seal she has a place where she can
[56:51] wait and she can say Lord how long until
[56:54] you avenge our blood we were killed
[56:56] under Eichmann and Hitler all these 2000
[56:59] years we've been killed God said I'm
[57:01] giving you a place not a place in hell
[57:03] not a place in purgatory I'm giving you
[57:06] a place under the altar amen
[57:08] oh that's amazing grace church amen a
[57:10] place of grace amen
[57:12] that's why I believe the foolish words
[57:13] you may have a similar place I just
[57:15] can't see how God program says she goes
[57:17] to the grave but he never said she went
[57:19] to hell
[57:20] so I believe if God had Grace on the
[57:23] blinded Jew that women could never
[57:26] receive Christ wouldn't receive Christ
[57:27] if God had grace on the blinded you I
[57:29] think God would have Grace on the
[57:31] foolish virgin now that's just that's
[57:32] just my thought he's got to have a place
[57:35] I believe of grace because where she had
[57:38] the place prepared of God that they
[57:40] should feed her there a thousand two
[57:43] hundred and threescore days now we know
[57:47] that's three and a half years all right
[57:50] and that's the same amount of time as
[57:53] the Ministry of the two witnesses in
[57:56] Revelation 11 3 I'm going to read it and
[57:58] I'll give power unto my two witnesses
[58:00] and they shall prophesy a thousand two
[58:06] hundred and threescore days clothed in
[58:10] sackcloth praise God now that just kind
[58:17] of strikes me here I just read it in the
[58:19] Bible can everybody turn to Azra please
[58:21] that just struck me I read this this a
[58:24] couple of days ago maybe yesterday
[58:27] Ezra Nehemiah Esther so after Chronicles
[58:33] Kings Kings Chronicles and chronicles
[58:35] Ezra Nehemiah Esther okay okay so now
[58:42] chapter five Ezra chapter five that's
[58:43] right so the Bible said she'll be this
[58:48] woman will be fed three and a half years
[58:51] and over here Ezra the Bible says it
[58:57] shows what prophecy does so when God
[59:02] speaks a prophetic word over a real
[59:06] believer it stimulates them amen
[59:10] it's it's like food to their soul praise
[59:13] the Lord when God speaks a word and God
[59:17] gives a thus saith the Lord
[59:19] it's like energy it's like food it's
[59:23] like strength so the Bible said she'll
[59:25] be fed out there in the wilderness
[59:27] she'll be fed in her place for three and
[59:29] a half years and that's going to be fed
[59:31] through the two witnesses because look
[59:34] at as we Chapter five look what happens
[59:38] in verse 1 then the prophets Hagee I the
[59:40] prophet and Zechariah the son of I doe
[59:42] prophesied under the Jews that were in
[59:44] Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the
[59:46] God of Israel even unto him then rose up
[59:48] zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and
[59:50] Jeshua the son of josedech and began to
[59:52] build up the house of God which is at
[59:54] Jerusalem and with them were the
[59:56] prophets of God helping them amen that's
[59:58] a real prophet of God a prophet of God
[1:00:00] does not walk in and say the SEC and
[1:00:04] go take a vacation out the wilderness
[1:00:05] for ten years a real prophet of God
[1:00:08] preaches the word and then he stays with
[1:00:11] you to encourage you and help you in the
[1:00:13] way praise God
[1:00:14] a man is heading the gap he had that
[1:00:18] temptation
[1:00:19] I'll just prophesy and open the
[1:00:21] wilderness but God wouldn't let him
[1:00:22] because God told him you're not an Old
[1:00:24] Testament prophet you're a New Testament
[1:00:26] prophet amen see God was helping them
[1:00:31] now remember this doesn't seem like much
[1:00:33] of a scripture for church but if you
[1:00:35] study the history when I preach on this
[1:00:37] they had not worked on the the church
[1:00:39] for 16 years go back and reach after 4
[1:00:44] and 5 they start building the foundation
[1:00:46] and then a law comes from the new king
[1:00:49] of Persia as a different King not Cyrus
[1:00:51] cyrus told him they could another King
[1:00:53] comes around says no stop because
[1:00:55] they're not going to pay they're not
[1:00:56] going to pay taxes and they're gonna
[1:00:57] demand customs and all these things and
[1:00:59] so they sit around scared for 16 years
[1:01:02] at the government right just like you
[1:01:04] and I probably would if we would have
[1:01:05] been there right
[1:01:06] I don't want anybody to hurt me I want
[1:01:09] to be arrested I always thrown in jail
[1:01:10] and all of a sudden under 16 years God
[1:01:12] anoints these two men and they stand up
[1:01:14] and say now saith the Lord
[1:01:16] finish the work finish the house of God
[1:01:18] it's thus saith the Lord and these men
[1:01:21] just all of a sudden they rise up amen
[1:01:23] that's what we need when we're down in
[1:01:25] this scourge we just need to hear the
[1:01:27] prophet of God say they'll say the Lord
[1:01:29] or maybe God will give you as I say at
[1:01:31] the Lord you and I need to hear thy
[1:01:33] sight the Lord and it'll raise us up
[1:01:34] amen
[1:01:35] if it raised them up under the Old
[1:01:37] Testament what's it gonna do to you and
[1:01:39] I under the New Testament a man right
[1:01:44] and then they start working with them
[1:01:47] they don't sit back and watch okay you
[1:01:51] guys do all the work we got the easy
[1:01:55] life now that's a lot of preachers that
[1:01:56] do that they'll say you do all the work
[1:01:59] I'm just gonna preach but we all need to
[1:02:02] labor for the kingdom of God everybody
[1:02:03] has a ministry everybody should be
[1:02:05] carrying a burden right everybody should
[1:02:08] be working for the kingdom of God that's
[1:02:10] right now there was one more in here but
[1:02:15] I read it my other Bible so at home this
[1:02:17] one
[1:02:17] at the church so let me see if I can
[1:02:21] find it all right well maybe I can't
[1:02:29] find that one but there was one more
[1:02:30] that said something about the power of
[1:02:32] this prophecy yeah I do apologize I
[1:02:42] thought I thought I could find it I
[1:02:45] thought I'd have it in here there's
[1:02:47] another one that says that just what the
[1:02:48] prophecy did to them it was such a
[1:02:50] stirring thing oh yeah I'm sorry there's
[1:02:53] chapter 6 verse 14 there this thank you
[1:02:55] for your patience sorry about that I
[1:02:57] appreciate your patience you know how
[1:03:00] many know that when brother Branham was
[1:03:01] first preaching his wife had to read all
[1:03:03] the scriptures because brother Ram
[1:03:04] couldn't read the Bible so people had to
[1:03:07] be very patient he'd say honey read the
[1:03:09] scripture then he say is that right do
[1:03:11] you do it do you live that word okay
[1:03:14] honey read the next one so thanks for
[1:03:17] your patience with me I appreciate it
[1:03:19] 6:14 and the elders of the Jews builded
[1:03:23] now listen and they prospered through
[1:03:26] the prophesying of Hagee I the prophet
[1:03:28] and Zechariah the son of a dome and they
[1:03:31] build it and finish it according to the
[1:03:33] commandment of God of Israel and
[1:03:34] according to the commandment of Cyrus
[1:03:36] and Daris and artaxerxes king of Persia
[1:03:38] amen
[1:03:39] hey ain't that the truth you and I have
[1:03:42] not withered because a brother has
[1:03:44] prophecy or got weaker we've prospered
[1:03:46] and we've got stronger amen hallelujah
[1:03:50] I've not got weaker spiritually since I
[1:03:53] heard brother brand in fact I've only
[1:03:55] got stronger since I've heard brother
[1:03:56] Branham preach a man because he was
[1:03:58] God's prophet back I was telling
[1:04:00] somebody that this week I said before I
[1:04:03] heard brother Graham I still chewed
[1:04:04] tobacco I still cussed I still smoked I
[1:04:07] was going to church I'm still watching
[1:04:08] too much sports and all these idols in
[1:04:10] my life because their preaching was was
[1:04:13] no power in it there was no life in it
[1:04:15] it was just dead letter but when I heard
[1:04:18] the voice of that prophet the first time
[1:04:20] I heard his voice I started bawling
[1:04:21] because I heard his life story why
[1:04:24] because it was something real there's a
[1:04:26] reality to it and within a matter of a
[1:04:29] year
[1:04:30] my addictions have been delivered
[1:04:32] because I was hearing the word for my
[1:04:34] day men I was an eagle gathered around
[1:04:38] the fresh carcass can I say like that
[1:04:40] amen
[1:04:41] where the carcass is the Eagles will be
[1:04:44] gathered you're in the right spot
[1:04:45] tonight gathered around the Word of God
[1:04:47] oh thank you
[1:04:50] to see what prophecy days it causes a
[1:04:53] real son of God to rise up amen
[1:04:56] a real daughter of God hearing the
[1:04:58] prophecy of God's prophet will raise you
[1:05:01] up it will prosper you it'll strengthen
[1:05:03] you and you'll finish what you started
[1:05:06] amen
[1:05:06] glory hallelujah now that's interesting
[1:05:11] I've never thought of this I just
[1:05:12] finished the book on Monday so now she's
[1:05:15] just got to get it ready and I got to
[1:05:16] the launch date so it's finished it's
[1:05:18] finished we're just waiting for the
[1:05:20] printing now I had 27 more and it's I to
[1:05:23] do on the Monday I think it was so 27
[1:05:25] little things to fix and now it's
[1:05:27] finished
[1:05:28] thank the Lord so I what do i tribute
[1:05:30] that to the Lord Jesus Christ helping me
[1:05:33] to spread God's Word
[1:05:35] amen thank you lord
[1:05:38] well hallelujah thank the Lord now okay
[1:05:43] now let's go on your Bible back to
[1:05:45] Revelation 12 appreciate your patience
[1:05:52] I'm just gonna like relevance I'd like
[1:05:53] to go scripture by scripture just like
[1:05:55] to teach this to the church by God's
[1:05:57] grace I found it so beneficial you know
[1:06:03] George I just find this you know if I
[1:06:04] just meditate on the word things just
[1:06:06] start coming to me don't you find that
[1:06:08] the more you meditate on the word the
[1:06:10] more revelation comes and then on top of
[1:06:13] that the more you pray for Revelation
[1:06:14] the more revelation comes that's right
[1:06:18] David said I'll meditate all day long
[1:06:21] upon your commandments amen
[1:06:23] now verse seven seven eight nine now am
[1:06:26] I in my study of the word these verses
[1:06:29] go together seven eight nine okay so
[1:06:33] three dose and there was war in heaven
[1:06:36] Michael and his angels fought against
[1:06:38] the Dragon and the dragon fought and his
[1:06:40] angels and prevailed not
[1:06:43] neither was their place found any more
[1:06:47] in heaven so God basically said I'm
[1:06:49] taking your real estate devil you don't
[1:06:52] have a place here you have no
[1:06:53] inheritance in heaven amen you know
[1:06:57] deserve a place in heaven right for what
[1:06:59] he did
[1:07:00] verse 9 and that Great Dragon was cast
[1:07:04] out that old serpent called the devil
[1:07:06] and Satan which deceiveth the whole
[1:07:08] world he was cast out into the earth and
[1:07:11] his angels were cast out with him now
[1:07:14] isn't this striking this is why no
[1:07:16] theologian can ever understand the Bible
[1:07:19] without a prophet because look verses 1
[1:07:23] and 2 are Jesus birth birth three and
[1:07:26] four Jesus birth verse five and six is
[1:07:29] Jesus birth death and resurrection and
[1:07:31] now seven eight-nine go all the way
[1:07:33] before that it's totally out of
[1:07:35] chronological order and the church said
[1:07:38] God because God loves to hide it from
[1:07:41] the eyes of the wise and prudent in
[1:07:43] their colleges and reveal it unto babes
[1:07:45] such as we learn on the Wednesday night
[1:07:47] gathering amen glory not my textbook but
[1:07:52] by revelation not my textbook but by the
[1:07:55] book hallelujah
[1:07:58] you understand so he now chronologically
[1:08:04] I finally said it right this goes above
[1:08:06] appear by chronological order so now God
[1:08:11] takes us back to the beginning and this
[1:08:14] is a revelation that just struck me this
[1:08:15] week - I was praying for more revelation
[1:08:17] the mystery of iniquity is talked about
[1:08:20] in the Bible Paul says it in 2nd
[1:08:23] Thessalonians chapter 2 but the mystery
[1:08:25] of iniquity is how Nick WA T start at
[1:08:27] the beginning and here it is at verse 7
[1:08:30] 8 and 9 where did a Nick when he start
[1:08:33] it started in heaven through the most
[1:08:35] beautiful most smart closest friend that
[1:08:40] God had brother Ram said it was his
[1:08:42] right-hand man to fellowship where -
[1:08:46] Nick WA T start the person closest to
[1:08:47] God now you might have an argument where
[1:08:50] both Michael and Lucifer were close to
[1:08:52] God and you and that might be right you
[1:08:54] know because the Bible said there
[1:08:57] two Archangels there's two right and and
[1:09:02] if with Moses's mercy-seat with the two
[1:09:05] angels there where the Moses get that it
[1:09:08] wasn't from his own mind the Bible said
[1:09:10] he got it from the pattern in heaven I'm
[1:09:12] just making the point one of God's
[1:09:15] closest friends looked at God and he got
[1:09:20] jealous and said I need a throne like
[1:09:22] that I'm gonna exalt myself above the
[1:09:25] right by the stars of God I'm gonna have
[1:09:27] a kingdom on the sides of the north you
[1:09:31] think you've been good enough just to
[1:09:32] watch God do it
[1:09:33] right wouldn't have been good enough
[1:09:35] just to say I can't do what this guy can
[1:09:37] do pray sir they praise God raised him
[1:09:40] but what good could have God must none
[1:09:43] of the church God must have been so
[1:09:44] humble he must have held back so much of
[1:09:48] his glory and power that Satan actually
[1:09:50] thought well I can have a throne like
[1:09:52] that - I can do that right so what do we
[1:09:56] find God is always hidden in humility
[1:09:59] hey man
[1:10:00] hallelujah God is so simple God is so
[1:10:03] humble he hides himself and he's always
[1:10:06] clothed in humility and when Jesus come
[1:10:08] on the earth he wasn't a fancy-looking
[1:10:10] guy pride in comas hair like I do hey
[1:10:13] hey the Bible said he had no beauty that
[1:10:15] we would desire him just a small 5 foot
[1:10:19] - man brother Branham says just a small
[1:10:21] man let it look like that just real
[1:10:23] small humble didn't tower over everybody
[1:10:27] not a muscle man just a humble I'm a man
[1:10:32] humble carpenter that's all he was God
[1:10:35] always hiding in simplicity but Satan
[1:10:37] cee so ve so so prideful he thinks well
[1:10:41] I can do that
[1:10:42] look how much greater than I am and he
[1:10:46] exalts himself above and because of that
[1:10:49] he starts the war so God must have been
[1:10:52] so humble that he thinks well I can
[1:10:54] actually defeat this side can you
[1:10:56] imagine that God must have been so
[1:10:59] humble that saying things were I just
[1:11:02] get some warriors I just get them if I
[1:11:04] can get recruit some troops I can be
[1:11:07] Michael I can beat all these angels
[1:11:11] huh me know that angels when they fight
[1:11:13] huh me no they fight but no one ever
[1:11:15] dies let me know that remember in Daniel
[1:11:18] chapter 10 when Daniels fasted for three
[1:11:20] weeks and the angel finally broke
[1:11:22] through what'd he say
[1:11:23] he said I was fighting the Prince of
[1:11:25] Persia for three weeks you thought you
[1:11:27] had a long fight you ever had been in a
[1:11:30] fight before yeah you know Taekwondo we
[1:11:33] spawn for three minutes that seems like
[1:11:34] a long fight but not really long
[1:11:37] compared to three weeks so for three
[1:11:40] weeks they must be wrestling the mouths
[1:11:42] of the wrestle and they're wrestling in
[1:11:44] the in the heavenly places and finally
[1:11:46] Michael comes and Michael grabs the
[1:11:48] Prince of Persia and kind of holds him
[1:11:50] off and so this angel can say all right
[1:11:52] I'm gonna go see Daniel I'll be right
[1:11:54] back but st. in the beginning said oh
[1:12:00] let's I don't know what I don't know if
[1:12:02] they have soul it's like the Chairman's
[1:12:04] with the flaming swords I don't know how
[1:12:05] they do it but they can attack and fight
[1:12:07] for weeks and weeks and weeks and still
[1:12:09] keep going but Satan thought I can win
[1:12:14] this war and Michael said no you can't
[1:12:18] at some point Michael said I'm throwing
[1:12:20] you I wonder if we took him by the back
[1:12:22] of his robe I want every threw him over
[1:12:24] the edge of the cliff of heaven you may
[1:12:28] kiss the Bible said they cast him out
[1:12:30] they didn't say mr. devil Oh would you
[1:12:33] mind leaving for a little bit mr. devil
[1:12:35] sir please that's not how God God says
[1:12:39] go God says the Lord rebuke thee get
[1:12:42] behind me Satan amen
[1:12:44] so one day Michael finally wrestling
[1:12:46] over in the corner said you're coming
[1:12:48] over her see you later
[1:12:55] can you imagine it but God alone and God
[1:12:59] sits back the whole time that's my angel
[1:13:02] boy he's just like me is that right God
[1:13:10] let them wrestle it out God let the
[1:13:12] Angels know what it's like to wrestle
[1:13:15] against the devil amen so that when one
[1:13:18] of us repents and gets the victory over
[1:13:21] Satan all those demons leave the Angels
[1:13:23] go to rejoice
[1:13:24] in heaven said hi brother Jesse's not a
[1:13:27] Christian and we know unselect overcome
[1:13:30] Satan we fought him too and Jesse got
[1:13:32] the victory just like we did amen
[1:13:35] angels care angels want to see us
[1:13:39] overcome all the guys do is caught on
[1:13:41] the scene by the name of Jesus Christ
[1:13:43] amen
[1:13:46] and then the Bible said we can cast him
[1:13:49] out glory just gotta remember which side
[1:13:52] wrote how many two reminders Lord just
[1:13:54] remind me which side I'm on
[1:13:56] remind me of the authority as brother
[1:13:58] camps remind me the authority that I
[1:14:00] have in Jesus Christ so it takes us all
[1:14:07] the way back to the beginning till they
[1:14:13] fast forward to 4000 years and then then
[1:14:15] they go back into time way before the
[1:14:17] earth was even founded well yeah yeah
[1:14:20] but then of course the earth we've been
[1:14:22] founded then he got thrown down and got
[1:14:23] cast down to earth at some point look at
[1:14:27] that striking far the war in heaven and
[1:14:31] the dragon fought Kate and they
[1:14:34] prevailed not neither was their place
[1:14:35] any more in heaven so see he's allowed
[1:14:40] to come to heaven but there's no resting
[1:14:42] place for him there I'm so glad that
[1:14:44] Jesus Christ said I'm going away to
[1:14:47] prepare a place for you amen
[1:14:51] that where I am you may there be also
[1:14:54] hallelujah I'm glad I've got a place in
[1:14:57] heaven and I know his name it's called
[1:14:59] the New Jerusalem amen amen
[1:15:03] but Satan he knows the place and that's
[1:15:06] one place he'll never take a step on
[1:15:08] amen there's a New Jerusalem ha ha
[1:15:11] amen because it was set up after he was
[1:15:13] kicked out and he'll never be a part of
[1:15:15] it amen
[1:15:16] Oh glory thank you lord
[1:15:22] thank goodness verse 9 then the Great
[1:15:25] Dragon was cast out that old serpent
[1:15:26] which is called the devil now remember
[1:15:28] he's got he's got four names here right
[1:15:30] or four titles dragon serpent devil
[1:15:33] Satan I put that on Facebook not long
[1:15:34] ago I said if Father Son Holy Ghost is
[1:15:37] three persons then Satan's for put that
[1:15:39] on Facebook and they're sure not many
[1:15:42] people challenging me on that one
[1:15:43] there's maybe one or two but they don't
[1:15:46] able to challenge that one because what
[1:15:48] do you do you you can't you can't make a
[1:15:50] title a name right that's why this Bible
[1:15:55] has all the answers you can't argue with
[1:15:56] this Bible amen
[1:15:58] just takes the Holy Spirit of directors
[1:16:00] to all the answers okay but now now look
[1:16:04] which deceiveth the whole world now this
[1:16:08] is striking Satan right now is deceiving
[1:16:11] the entire world now this is stated in
[1:16:13] three more scriptures let's read them
[1:16:16] tonight because we got time I'm just but
[1:16:18] any time here let me do I do you want to
[1:16:20] said time without I don't you don't know
[1:16:22] where you got where myself out
[1:16:24] okay so let's go and your Bibles let's
[1:16:26] go to Revelation 13:7
[1:16:28] we're gonna see this the Bible says that
[1:16:31] four times in Revelation that Satan
[1:16:34] deceives the whole earth that means he's
[1:16:35] got to deceive China we've said it
[1:16:36] before Russia Australia the United
[1:16:39] States Canada Satan has to deceive every
[1:16:42] single nation under heaven with this
[1:16:45] beast system with the image of the Beast
[1:16:46] the World Council of Churches and then
[1:16:48] the Roman Catholic Church Satan has to
[1:16:50] deceive all of them now verse seven and
[1:16:55] it was given unto him to make war with
[1:16:57] the Saints and to overcome them and
[1:16:58] power was given him over all Kindred's
[1:17:00] tongues and nations to see their Satan's
[1:17:02] give them the Beast is given power over
[1:17:04] all them now the next one 14-8
[1:17:08] revelation 14 8 if you got your Bible
[1:17:10] revelation 14 II and then found another
[1:17:12] angel saying Babylon has fallen is
[1:17:14] fallen that great city because she has
[1:17:16] made all nations even communist ones
[1:17:21] drink of the wine of the wrath of her
[1:17:24] fornication
[1:17:25] so even communist communist nations are
[1:17:28] gonna fornicate with the mother harlot
[1:17:31] are you with me
[1:17:32] in that striking even
[1:17:36] his countries are gonna be perverted
[1:17:38] with Roman Catholic and her daughter's
[1:17:40] doctrine now next 18 3 revelation 18 3
[1:17:49] do you like these scriptures you like
[1:17:51] going through like that I think it's
[1:17:53] beautiful I think it makes it even more
[1:17:56] clear and of course it gives you more
[1:17:58] revelation brother BAM said in the
[1:17:59] church age book the Holy Ghost will not
[1:18:01] change the revelation but he will give
[1:18:03] you more information on the same
[1:18:04] revelation look it up look up more
[1:18:07] information maybe I can show it to you
[1:18:08] you got a minute can I show to you well
[1:18:11] let's read this first to know
[1:18:13] Revelation imagine if you're here you
[1:18:15] got an extra minute or two I imagine but
[1:18:17] I just want to ask to be kind you know I
[1:18:19] want to at least hear one person say
[1:18:21] Amen revelation 18 3 look this for all
[1:18:25] nations Wow even when orth Korea right
[1:18:31] there meet with North Korea this week
[1:18:32] right even Iran Saudi Arabia all these
[1:18:37] nations that seem like although never
[1:18:39] agree with anything with the Western
[1:18:40] nations the Bible said all nations have
[1:18:44] drunk of the wine of the wrath of her
[1:18:46] fornication the kings of the earth have
[1:18:48] committed fornication with her and the
[1:18:49] merchants of the earth are waxed rich
[1:18:50] through her abundance of her delicacies
[1:18:52] mine so the Roman Catholic Church must
[1:18:55] have influence over the economy because
[1:19:00] that's that's how they fornicate with
[1:19:02] her they allow her to into their country
[1:19:05] in order to get have the all the
[1:19:07] delicacies of her finances she must have
[1:19:11] control over that that's what the Word
[1:19:13] of God says in 1823 and the light of the
[1:19:17] candle shall shine no more at all in
[1:19:18] thee
[1:19:19] speaking of Rome and the voice of the
[1:19:21] bridegroom another bride shall be heard
[1:19:22] no more at all in thee for thy merchants
[1:19:25] were the great men of the earth for by
[1:19:27] thy sorceries were all nations deceived
[1:19:29] my every nation now some just struck me
[1:19:32] there I never thought of it before yes
[1:19:34] at this point
[1:19:35] Rome is never going to have the voice of
[1:19:37] the bride or the bridegroom in her you
[1:19:42] catch it but we got it in Akron
[1:19:47] we've got the voice of the bride and the
[1:19:50] bridegroom right here in accurate Amen I
[1:19:53] did yeah it just struck me I never
[1:19:56] thought about that they're going to get
[1:19:59] cut off
[1:19:59] no little broad voice no more word voice
[1:20:02] no more preaching no more Jesus
[1:20:04] vindicating no more Jesus promise on
[1:20:06] your healing then no more that but we've
[1:20:09] got it right here thanks be to God amen
[1:20:11] at the voice of the bride and the
[1:20:13] bridegroom is right here brother brand
[1:20:17] did say the bride has a voice and the
[1:20:20] voice is the same as the Prophet he said
[1:20:21] the bride the voice and the word I'll
[1:20:23] say the same thing let me pull it up so
[1:20:29] I can prove to you now we do the more
[1:20:34] information and then we'll do the voice
[1:20:35] of the bride the spirit and the bride
[1:20:37] say come see Bob Arum says this he said
[1:20:41] he can get a revelation and then add to
[1:20:43] it yeah as he did in the Garden of Eden
[1:20:46] when he promised the seed of the woman
[1:20:48] and then later designated that that seed
[1:20:50] had to come through Abraham and the
[1:20:52] later said would come by the same
[1:20:53] bloodlines and David but it was the same
[1:20:55] revelation it only gave people more
[1:20:57] information to help them receive and
[1:21:00] understand it but God's Word won't
[1:21:02] change amen see so with with Jesus's
[1:21:06] first coming God just kept giving me
[1:21:08] more information or he's going to bruise
[1:21:10] a serpent then it's all okay well he's
[1:21:12] going to be in the seed of Abraham then
[1:21:13] he's gonna be the seed of David and God
[1:21:15] just kept getting more and more
[1:21:16] revelation that's what God is doing with
[1:21:18] the rapture amen God has given us more
[1:21:20] and more word in order to prepare us for
[1:21:22] that great catching away hallelujah amen
[1:21:27] that's why these people that say only
[1:21:29] say what the tapes it only say that
[1:21:30] that's true to extent as long as you say
[1:21:33] the same revelation of what the tapes
[1:21:35] say but the Holy Spirit can give a new
[1:21:37] scripture brother Branham never preached
[1:21:39] and as long as it lines up with us that
[1:21:42] revelation all it is is more information
[1:21:44] for the bride of Jesus Christ amen
[1:21:47] that's right and that's the difference I
[1:21:50] agree with that but there's more to it
[1:21:54] than that that's right voice of the
[1:21:57] bride
[1:21:59] the spirit and the bride and the Prophet
[1:22:02] he said they all say come so it's not
[1:22:03] voice sorry spirit and the bride say
[1:22:06] come
[1:22:08] okay it's not doing the church age book
[1:22:10] yeah but the church age book is but both
[1:22:12] have said the spirit and the Prophet oh
[1:22:15] I'm doing an exact phrase that's the
[1:22:17] problem
[1:22:18] prophet and the bride spirit I'll say
[1:22:24] the same thing yeah so he says they that
[1:22:35] here brother branham in other words the
[1:22:36] seventh angel will be blessed and become
[1:22:38] part of that bride the last day aren't
[1:22:39] you glad hey man thank God for William
[1:22:43] Branham amen hallelujah because we heard
[1:22:46] him we can be part of the bride amen
[1:22:49] because Rebecca heard ELISA she could
[1:22:52] marry Isaac ha ha ha
[1:22:53] amen we get to marry Christ because we
[1:22:56] heard God's prophet brother oh thank you
[1:23:00] Lord amen thank you Jesus glory oh thank
[1:23:06] you lord
[1:23:06] he said the spear of the bride say come
[1:23:09] the corn of wheat the bride wheat that
[1:23:11] fell to the ground and I see have come
[1:23:13] back to the original word grain again
[1:23:16] praise God forever yes listen to the
[1:23:19] authenticated prophet of God who appears
[1:23:21] the last age what he says from God the
[1:23:25] bride will say Amen the spirit and the
[1:23:29] prophet and the bride will be saying the
[1:23:32] same thing and what they would say we
[1:23:35] have already been said in the word amen
[1:23:37] and the word never says to worship
[1:23:41] brother Branham the Lord never says to
[1:23:43] stop having preachers preach the gospel
[1:23:45] with me church so see the bride will
[1:23:48] only say what the prophet said which is
[1:23:50] only what the word says Amen so who
[1:23:54] really believes brother branham's the
[1:23:55] Prophet the bride the bride those who
[1:23:59] don't add to the prophets or the Bible's
[1:24:01] word with me I'm not upset I'm not
[1:24:05] attacking anybody you understand you
[1:24:06] understand what I'm saying listen listen
[1:24:08] the bride doesn't add to the
[1:24:10] the spirit and the bride say come they
[1:24:13] say the same thing and they're gonna say
[1:24:16] everything the Prophet said amen
[1:24:18] alright so that was fresh and it wasn't
[1:24:20] wasn't plan on sharing that one either
[1:24:22] but I just tried to be led to the Holy
[1:24:24] Spirit back tonight by God's grace okay
[1:24:26] now I go back to Revelation 12 all right
[1:24:31] so we did seven yeah versus seven eight
[1:24:34] nine yeah okay verses 10 and 12 now
[1:24:40] revelation 12 verses 10 and 12 well I'm
[1:24:45] just having a good old time sin I praise
[1:24:46] the Lord for having a good offer thank
[1:24:49] you lord I love this word my thank you
[1:24:54] Jesus
[1:24:54] such a privilege such a privilege all
[1:24:58] those years you know in denomination I
[1:25:00] just I had to go I had to go to church I
[1:25:01] never stood the Bible and now we can
[1:25:03] understand it and I don't have to say I
[1:25:05] think this is right we got thus saith
[1:25:07] the Lord it's right and not many people
[1:25:09] have that we're the one of the only few
[1:25:11] people that have thus saith the Lord
[1:25:14] thank you lord verse 10 11 and 12 go
[1:25:17] together yeah
[1:25:17] so I group the last the last part of
[1:25:20] this chapter I group it into these three
[1:25:22] verses and these five verses 13 14 15 16
[1:25:25] 17 yeah hey verse 10 and I heard of loud
[1:25:32] voice saying in heaven now is come
[1:25:33] salvation and strength and the Kingdom
[1:25:35] of our God and the power of his Christ
[1:25:36] and that's one can write on one Sunday
[1:25:38] right yeah for the accuse of our brother
[1:25:42] is cast down which accused them before
[1:25:45] our God day and night all right and that
[1:25:49] great that's a wonderful time that's
[1:25:51] that's about the time of the rapture
[1:25:52] right there when Satan ket's cast down
[1:25:55] and there's no more accusing there can't
[1:25:57] mean it accusing because now the Saints
[1:26:00] are glorified bodies there's no more sin
[1:26:03] amen no more accusations because there's
[1:26:06] no more mistakes no more bad attitudes
[1:26:09] no more slipping a lie just you know we
[1:26:11] look out of your mouth that you didn't
[1:26:12] need no more evil lustful thoughts or no
[1:26:14] more greedy no more angry thoughts you
[1:26:17] can't send any more because eternal life
[1:26:19] has swallowed up your mortal body amen
[1:26:22] Oh hallelujah amen thank you Jesus
[1:26:26] the Bible said he'll swallow up your
[1:26:28] vile body and they'll be transformed
[1:26:31] like Anna's glorious body amen
[1:26:35] thank you lord okay verse 11 and they
[1:26:40] overcome him by the blood of man by the
[1:26:42] word of their testimony and they loved
[1:26:45] not their lives unto death if anybody
[1:26:49] wants to make a testimony video let me
[1:26:50] know I'll be happy to record you're
[1:26:51] doing a testimony I did one for Simon
[1:26:53] mike.mccluskey I did one for sister barb
[1:26:57] from cams Church and they're all in on
[1:26:58] Vimeo or Facebook or something like that
[1:27:00] or YouTube rather YouTube there's
[1:27:03] something powerful about giving your
[1:27:04] testimony I think you I think you
[1:27:06] understand right you got to have a
[1:27:09] testimony you have to show and declare
[1:27:13] how Jesus Christ has helped you pass the
[1:27:15] test because life is a big test remember
[1:27:21] the Bible said that that God sent His
[1:27:23] Word and tested Joseph yeah I go to
[1:27:27] Psalms 105 I just heard the scripture
[1:27:29] this week - yeah Psalms
[1:27:36] it's 105 I can't remember the verse but
[1:27:40] just I believe it's there my memory
[1:27:42] serves me correctly yep so I was one of
[1:27:48] the five it's now 17 he sent a man
[1:27:51] before them even Joseph who was sold for
[1:27:53] a servant yeah
[1:27:54] thank you lord verse 18 whose feet they
[1:27:57] hurt with fetters he was laid an iron
[1:28:02] remember that 11 years is part of her
[1:28:05] servant two years in prison
[1:28:08] verse 19 until the time that his word
[1:28:12] came glory the word of the Lord
[1:28:16] tried him oh thank you God God gave him
[1:28:23] the word when he had the vision all my
[1:28:26] brothers are gonna bow down to worship
[1:28:28] me glory to God
[1:28:29] I've got a bright future and what
[1:28:32] happened after that and like it's like
[1:28:35] his world was turned upside down
[1:28:36] see first God gives you the wail of
[1:28:39] prophecy God gets you really happy about
[1:28:41] what he's gonna do for you
[1:28:43] and then he tests you out to see if you
[1:28:45] really believe it the same thing was
[1:28:47] true for Abraham you're gonna be the
[1:28:49] father of Nations and 24 years later
[1:28:51] he's like we're gonna have a baby yeah
[1:28:56] Sarah's laughing yeah right God will
[1:29:00] speak prophecy for your life he'll tell
[1:29:03] you his plan and then he'll test you to
[1:29:06] see if you really believe that but he
[1:29:08] knows a true child of God will pass the
[1:29:10] test
[1:29:11] amen and so the whole time he's just
[1:29:15] like I've got a word I've got a word
[1:29:17] I've got a word but he was waiting to
[1:29:18] the word came to a fulfillment and
[1:29:21] that's all we're doing hey we've got
[1:29:24] wave upon wave and thus said to look on
[1:29:26] the bride and this and that all we're
[1:29:28] doing is being tried and tested God just
[1:29:31] wants to see that you really believe
[1:29:32] this is the Word of God amen and at the
[1:29:36] end of this the Word of God will try you
[1:29:38] the Word of God will come to you and
[1:29:40] you'll come forth the Bible said you'll
[1:29:42] come forth as I am a true believer I am
[1:29:47] an overcomer a man I do believe God's
[1:29:49] Word
[1:29:50] amen glory see you overcome by the word
[1:29:55] of your testimony Joseph didn't say all
[1:29:59] my life was so simple my life was so
[1:30:02] easy I had a dream my brother's gonna
[1:30:05] serve me and five days later everybody
[1:30:08] was serving me I got to eat meat every
[1:30:10] day and grapes and it was just a really
[1:30:13] easy life that wasn't his testimony No
[1:30:17] God showed him the great things planned
[1:30:19] for his life but it was only after great
[1:30:22] harsh trials think like that with
[1:30:24] everybody David said you're going to be
[1:30:26] king so Sanderson
[1:30:27] I'm anointing you your cups running over
[1:30:30] and you're gonna be king and then he had
[1:30:32] to run from Saul for 13 years chased out
[1:30:35] and the end of that 13 years where he
[1:30:37] said I'm no better than a dog he put
[1:30:41] himself than a dog and yet where's all
[1:30:45] the where's all the great emotion and
[1:30:46] whiz where's all the emotion from the
[1:30:49] giant killing see God had to test him
[1:30:52] gotta to really make sure you really
[1:30:53] believe that word church are you really
[1:30:55] sure you believe this is God's Word are
[1:30:57] you really sure if you're a child of God
[1:30:59] you'll pass the test you'll keep hanging
[1:31:02] on even when you don't feel like hanging
[1:31:04] on you'll keep believing you'll keep
[1:31:06] trusting and in due season God will
[1:31:08] manifest that word that word of promise
[1:31:10] will come to you later
[1:31:13] hallelujah every man of God every woman
[1:31:18] of God went through the same thing
[1:31:20] he first shows you this beautiful
[1:31:22] promise they says let's see if he
[1:31:24] believed that's what the devil said
[1:31:25] let's see if he believes and gods like
[1:31:26] he believes it she believes it oh she
[1:31:31] won't wait for 35 years you know she
[1:31:34] can't do that what do you think she is
[1:31:38] he thinks she has some some special kind
[1:31:41] of person and gods like yes she's very
[1:31:42] peculiar she's a peculiar treasure unto
[1:31:45] me she's an alien and a sojourner he's
[1:31:49] an alien he's a sojourner he's perfect
[1:31:51] because he's got a perfect sacrifice my
[1:31:53] own son the blood of jesus christ well
[1:31:57] how'd I get on that praise the Lord
[1:31:59] thank you Jesus you gotta have a
[1:32:02] testimony Church
[1:32:04] verse 12 therefore rejoice ye heavens
[1:32:06] and either draw on the earth woe to the
[1:32:08] inhabiters of the earth and of the sea
[1:32:09] for the devil's come down unto you
[1:32:11] having great wrath because you know they
[1:32:13] have a short time so that is when Satan
[1:32:15] comes down for the Great Tribulation
[1:32:17] Period so see verses 10 11 and 12 have
[1:32:23] to be at the time of the rapture 10 is
[1:32:25] at the time of the rapture because
[1:32:27] there's no more accusing in heaven and
[1:32:30] then 11 11 is how they overcome before
[1:32:36] that and 12 is then Satan coming down
[1:32:39] I've only got a short season I can't
[1:32:41] accuse the Saints any more so I've got
[1:32:42] to do the most damage I possibly can all
[1:32:46] right everybody got that can anybody say
[1:32:48] man you got that okay let's move on
[1:32:49] let's try finish this I got a few more
[1:32:51] things I want to I'm sure verse 13 now
[1:32:56] the timing of all of this 13 to 17 is
[1:32:59] during the Tribulation Period and when
[1:33:03] the dragon saw the he was cast out under
[1:33:05] the earth he persecuted the woman which
[1:33:06] brought forth the man child that's not
[1:33:08] the bride that's Israel because she's
[1:33:12] the one that brought forth Christ the
[1:33:15] man child and to the woman were given
[1:33:17] two wings of a great eagle that she
[1:33:20] might find a wilderness into her place
[1:33:22] see so the Bible even tells us when she
[1:33:25] goes to that place she goes that place
[1:33:27] at the time of the of the Great
[1:33:30] Tribulation she goes and hides in that
[1:33:32] place where she has her two prophets to
[1:33:34] feed her the Word of God and where she
[1:33:39] is nourished oh glory for a time now
[1:33:42] time is a year did you know that I've
[1:33:45] been studying on that little bit I'm
[1:33:46] gonna preach more on that a time is a
[1:33:47] year so she's there for a time and times
[1:33:50] x is two years so time times and a half
[1:33:57] time so three and a half years and that
[1:34:00] beautiful that's fresh to me that's been
[1:34:02] fresh God's has been opening these
[1:34:03] things up here time times and then half
[1:34:08] a time so what time are you in in your
[1:34:13] life that
[1:34:15] and that wonderful to think about that
[1:34:17] well what time is God doing right what
[1:34:20] is this guy gonna do this year in my
[1:34:21] life that's what we should all ask God
[1:34:23] right what are you gonna do in this time
[1:34:26] of my life because the time is a year
[1:34:30] remember to everything there's a time
[1:34:34] per person to season glory just blow it
[1:34:37] out hallelujah did you know there's 14
[1:34:41] times and seasons and of please ask
[1:34:44] these three and they each have a
[1:34:47] matching and opposite effect there's a
[1:34:50] time to be born and a time to die that's
[1:34:53] one of them that's one there's fourteen
[1:34:55] matching pairs at church maybe God will
[1:34:58] show us which time or season word would
[1:35:02] not be beautiful to see that I know
[1:35:05] about you but I'd love to know exactly
[1:35:07] where I am with God weren't you by the
[1:35:10] brand new he knew was in the first poll
[1:35:12] right second poll third Pole I like to
[1:35:18] know exactly where I stand with God
[1:35:19] that's beautiful
[1:35:21] verse 15 and the serpent cast out of his
[1:35:23] mouth I know I don't know what this
[1:35:25] represents water as a flood I don't
[1:35:27] understand that I don't know if it's a
[1:35:28] natural flood or if it's like the armies
[1:35:31] coming against Israel I don't know as a
[1:35:36] flood after the woman that he might
[1:35:37] cause her to be carried away of the
[1:35:39] flood I know the Bible says when an
[1:35:41] enemy comes in like a flood I don't know
[1:35:43] if this is a because the description I
[1:35:45] don't know if this is a physical flood
[1:35:46] or just an army attack or some some evil
[1:35:50] attack look at verse 15 and the serpent
[1:35:53] cast out of his mouth a flood
[1:35:55] I'm sorry water there is water as a
[1:35:57] flood after the woman that he might
[1:36:00] cause her to be carried away of the
[1:36:02] flood and the earth opened up
[1:36:04] I'm sure help the woman and the earth
[1:36:07] opened her mouth and swallowed up the
[1:36:10] flood which the Dragon cast out of his
[1:36:13] mouth so a flood a water flood comes out
[1:36:16] of the the devil's mouth and tries to
[1:36:18] swallow him up so probably not natural
[1:36:20] rot water right but it's kind of hard to
[1:36:22] say and I haven't I've looked up quotes
[1:36:24] on that I haven't found many good quotes
[1:36:25] on that so I don't know exactly how
[1:36:27] brother Bram interpreted that one
[1:36:30] and verse 17 and the woman was Roth I'm
[1:36:33] sorry and the dragon was wroth with the
[1:36:35] woman and went to make war with the
[1:36:38] remnant of her seed which keep the
[1:36:40] commandments of God and have the
[1:36:42] testimony of Jesus Christ amen so see
[1:36:46] Church look look what happens Moses and
[1:36:48] Elijah nourish her for three and a half
[1:36:50] years and what are they doing they're
[1:36:51] teaching her about Jesus Christ because
[1:36:54] now she doesn't just have the testimony
[1:36:56] of the Word of God now she's got the
[1:36:58] testimony of the word and Jesus Christ
[1:37:01] ha ha amen thank you lord
[1:37:07] beautiful now let's close to this I just
[1:37:10] want to do a few things here I want to
[1:37:13] share a few things by God's grace
[1:37:18] brother Branham gave us thus saith the
[1:37:20] Lord on the church ages chapter one two
[1:37:24] three he gave us thus saith the Lord on
[1:37:26] the seven seals he says now see friends
[1:37:30] this is in the seventh seal in 1963
[1:37:32] March 24th visions doesn't fail I talked
[1:37:35] about the vision of the seven angels in
[1:37:37] the cloud commissioning to preach the
[1:37:39] seven seals that's the vision he's
[1:37:40] talking about how you went out west
[1:37:43] they're always perfect they're exactly
[1:37:45] true now the vision plus the word plus
[1:37:48] the history plus the church ages and all
[1:37:50] them blend together so I could truly say
[1:37:52] the best of my understanding according
[1:37:54] the Word of God the vision and the
[1:37:55] revelation the interpretation thereof is
[1:37:58] thus saith the Lord so we have thus
[1:38:03] saith the Lord on those four chapters
[1:38:05] and then for next week Lord willing or
[1:38:09] maybe Sunday when I preach us we have
[1:38:11] thus saith the Lord for revelation 13
[1:38:13] verses 16 17 and 18 so from my searching
[1:38:18] we have thus saith the Lord for at least
[1:38:21] four full chapters and then part of
[1:38:24] another actually I could have put 8 on
[1:38:25] there too because the 7th seal the 7
[1:38:28] seals in chapter 8
[1:38:29] and programs that's a day the unknown
[1:38:31] day an hour of Christ's coming all right
[1:38:34] so let's read that go revelation 13:16
[1:38:38] 18
[1:38:42] you and I don't have to worry and wonder
[1:38:46] what is the mark of the beast is it a
[1:38:49] computer chip my brother ran like a man
[1:38:52] preaching about Rams day it's a pill you
[1:38:54] take and it makes you grow as big as a
[1:38:56] three-story building
[1:38:58] but a man said he he thought those guys
[1:39:00] were just they lost it you know they
[1:39:01] were crazy he said can you imagine he
[1:39:04] said a Holy Ghost field person believing
[1:39:07] that that's the mark of the beast
[1:39:09] they'll give you a pill and you grow
[1:39:11] three stories tall that church I don't
[1:39:17] know that man must have been trying to
[1:39:19] get money I don't know what he was
[1:39:20] trying to do must been trying to sell
[1:39:21] those pills or something I don't know
[1:39:23] what I mean there's nothing in scripture
[1:39:25] about that but we don't have to wonder
[1:39:28] is it a microchip is it a new ATM
[1:39:31] machine coming out its the confederation
[1:39:36] of churches thus saith the Lord
[1:39:40] look at verse 16 17 18 and he causes all
[1:39:45] both small rates we can have the Beast
[1:39:47] rich and poor free and bond to receive a
[1:39:49] mark in their right hand or and though
[1:39:51] to see it's not it's not it's one of the
[1:39:52] other and brother may have said it's
[1:39:54] either the right hand is the doing the
[1:39:56] will of the the the Confederation
[1:39:58] churches you do the works that they want
[1:40:00] you to do or you believe their doctrines
[1:40:04] the mark in the forehead that's what of
[1:40:05] em says and that no man might buy or
[1:40:08] sell save that he had the mark of the
[1:40:10] number of the beast of the number of his
[1:40:11] name
[1:40:11] here's wisdom let him that hath
[1:40:14] understanding count the number of the
[1:40:15] beast for his a number of a man the Pope
[1:40:17] and his number is six hundred threescore
[1:40:19] and six I was preaching at the middle
[1:40:23] school on Tuesday morning and there was
[1:40:29] a
[1:40:30] in there but I was preaching the
[1:40:31] teenagers and I was preaching on the
[1:40:36] third parable mystery of Jesus Christ
[1:40:38] the grain of mustard seed and I said
[1:40:41] that grain a mustard seed could be faith
[1:40:44] but I said it's more likely like I
[1:40:46] preach it here but like brother said
[1:40:47] it's more likely that false church that
[1:40:50] got planted because of all the birds
[1:40:52] that that roost on it how many remember
[1:40:54] that because birds in the Bible always
[1:40:58] represent spirits and I said I said
[1:41:02] children or youth I said let me give you
[1:41:05] a warning there's a church out there
[1:41:07] that is a cage of unclean and hateful
[1:41:10] bird and a boy looked at me and said who
[1:41:12] is that church mr. Smith and I really
[1:41:16] wanted to tell him but I said well I
[1:41:21] don't feel like I should tell you I said
[1:41:23] you pray about it and God the reveal to
[1:41:25] you see right because the Bible said in
[1:41:29] James 1 if you ask for wisdom God will
[1:41:31] give it to you well little did I know
[1:41:35] after we all shake hands I give him
[1:41:36] starbursts and suckers as they go thanks
[1:41:38] for coming
[1:41:38] god bless you you know you take these
[1:41:40] divers the librarian comes up and said
[1:41:44] mr. Smith who is Mystery Babylon I
[1:41:47] thought well hallelujah she's an adult I
[1:41:49] can share with her so I lean real down
[1:41:52] no she's got cut hair and makeup on and
[1:41:54] I said it's the Roman Catholic Church
[1:41:56] and I'm expecting like to get like I was
[1:42:00] ready to get a little fight you know
[1:42:01] she's like oh yeah I believe that too
[1:42:03] I'm like glory
[1:42:04] I said hallelujah I said Roman Catholic
[1:42:09] Church now she said well but I think it
[1:42:11] might be something else and I said well
[1:42:12] friend I didn't call sister
[1:42:14] I said well friend I said the Bible said
[1:42:17] the mother harlot has daughters she was
[1:42:20] saying oh it's just it's not really a
[1:42:22] church it's more like a movement I said
[1:42:24] no it's a church it's the mother church
[1:42:27] I said look at all the abuse that's
[1:42:29] going out through her and I said all the
[1:42:32] daughters all the churches that hold her
[1:42:34] false doctrine
[1:42:37] so taught me a good lesson
[1:42:39] Church if you stand on the truth if you
[1:42:42] stay on the God's Word people are
[1:42:43] listening God's gonna send those
[1:42:46] predestinated souls to hear the truth of
[1:42:48] God now whether she ever comes back and
[1:42:51] asked anymore she's accountable now
[1:42:53] because Church how many believe that the
[1:42:55] rapture could be in this generation you
[1:42:57] do believe that I'm 38 the next
[1:43:01] generation forty years I'll be 78 is it
[1:43:04] possible the rapture could take place in
[1:43:06] my lifetime absolutely look at the rate
[1:43:09] it's going with homosexuality and
[1:43:12] abortion and transgender look at the
[1:43:15] rate and the Roman Catholic Church look
[1:43:17] at the rate it's going could it happen
[1:43:20] next generation it may and so what do we
[1:43:22] have to do we have to shine the light of
[1:43:24] God to a dark and dying world we have to
[1:43:31] be the voice of the bride and we have to
[1:43:33] let the voice of the bridegroom speak
[1:43:35] through us amen let me close my eye just
[1:43:38] loose on all track of time now I even
[1:43:41] told my wife tonight I said honey I'm
[1:43:42] gonna try to preach those shorter
