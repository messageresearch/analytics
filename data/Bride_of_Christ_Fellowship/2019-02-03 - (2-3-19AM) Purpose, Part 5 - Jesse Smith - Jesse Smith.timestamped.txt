[29:44] of the Lord
[29:45] let's open up to Acts chapter 11 verse
[29:48] 22 we'd like to continue on this series
[29:51] on purpose by the grace of God this is
[29:53] part five Acts chapter
[30:04] verse 22 X 1122 by the grace of the Lord
[30:13] I trust you've been enjoying this little
[30:19] series here by the grace of the Lord ah
[30:21] I think there's very few things that are
[30:24] as important as finding your purpose in
[30:26] life how many could say amen to that so
[30:28] this is a soul issue right this is an
[30:30] issue of the soul your soul has to find
[30:33] out the will of God for your life
[30:35] brother Ram said it's a mystery every
[30:37] person must seek God for the will of God
[30:40] for their lives and as we looked at last
[30:43] week you know God drives you to his will
[30:46] or your purpose and then once you find
[30:48] that purpose that purpose drives you I'm
[30:51] glad to be driven by the purpose of God
[30:53] today not driven by a fleshly purpose or
[30:56] a man's idea I'm driven by the Holy
[30:58] Spirit today so I'm very thankful each
[31:00] Christian can have that confidence when
[31:02] you've met the pillar fire praise God he
[31:06] meant acts 11 22 then tidings of these
[31:13] things came unto the ears of the church
[31:15] which was in Jerusalem and they sent
[31:18] forth Barnabas that he should go as far
[31:20] as Antioch who and he came and he had
[31:23] seen the grace of God was glad and
[31:25] exhorted them all that with purpose of
[31:27] heart they would cleave unto the Lord
[31:29] for he was a good man and full of the
[31:33] Holy Ghost in a faith and much people
[31:35] was added unto the Lord let's bow our
[31:38] heads for a word of Prayer if you ever
[31:39] need on your heart just making known
[31:41] unto God let's pray together
[31:42] Church you can pray in your heart I'll
[31:45] pray out loud hear my heart as well

[31:49] we've gathered in your name Lord we're
[31:51] your chosen seed Lord those of us who
[31:53] are believing the full word of God and
[31:55] we're thankful that this word has been
[31:57] revealed in the end time Lord God or
[31:59] you've predestinate us to live here Lord
[32:01] God and father we go through many
[32:03] battles but Lord we know if we've got
[32:05] the King's sword in our hand Lord and
[32:07] victory is assured for Lord your sword
[32:10] is your word and father your sword can
[32:13] never fail Lord so we thank you for the
[32:15] word of God in this hour speak

[32:20] need Lord that's my intercession before
[32:21] now dear God that you meet every need

[32:26] to every hungry heart Lord God and we'd
[32:28] ask that you be glorified honored and
[32:30] worshipped today be magnified prepares
[32:33] for thy great coming this meeting in the
[32:34] air Lord God our destiny is in the sky
[32:37] Lord to meet our bridegroom there so
[32:40] father prepare us again once more by
[32:42] your word in Jesus Christ's name and the
[32:44] church said Amen god bless yous being
[32:47] seated praise the Lord you can switch
[32:51] over lady I have some quotes I'd like to
[32:53] share today by the grace of the Lord
[32:56] also I just wanna let everybody know
[32:58] that I'm getting really close to
[32:59] finishing up the book here on our
[33:02] website I have links there to our videos
[33:06] but there's a special tab there says
[33:07] there's the book restoring Christian
[33:10] modesty so it's if you click on that
[33:13] little link you can also get to it if
[33:14] you click on that slider which I'll show
[33:17] once it gets back there so if you click
[33:21] on it it'll go to that page that's
[33:23] linked right there and then it just has
[33:24] a picture and it's going to try to be
[33:26] available March 1st by God's grace I'm
[33:29] just working on the date and everything
[33:31] like that but I'm really excited about
[33:33] that they can be used as outreach I
[33:36] started this in November 2017 so it's
[33:38] been a little over a year and it's nice
[33:40] to see it finally come to a conclusion
[33:42] you know so I'm very thankful I hope
[33:44] you're I hope you're as excited as I am
[33:46] if you can and of course the church
[33:48] would like to buy everybody copies so if
[33:50] you belong to our church you don't have
[33:51] to go buy one you can just I'll just get
[33:55] you one by the grace of Lord remember
[33:59] it's an outreach book so as you read it
[34:01] you'll see I'm not mentioning brother
[34:02] Branham until the last chapter and
[34:04] that's when I say where do you get all
[34:05] your teachings from and I say I got it
[34:07] from brother Branham my brother Graham
[34:08] got it from Jesus right the message did
[34:12] not come from brother Branham he
[34:13] preached it but the message is the Word
[34:15] of God
[34:17] ah that came from we just want to make
[34:19] that distinction because there's many
[34:21] today saying I've heard him say it they
[34:23] say the tapes is the word and the tapes
[34:25] is not the word the tapes point to the
[34:27] word and it actually exalts the tapes
[34:29] above what they ought to be although we
[34:31] thank God for the tapes we don't worship
[34:34] the tapes the tapes is not the word the
[34:37] word is the holy spirits message for us
[34:39] today so we just want to make that
[34:41] distinction and it's an outreach book
[34:43] like I said so may the Lord bless us
[34:45] here and God's divine presence I'd like
[34:49] to look at part five here and I'm just
[34:51] going to set a little timer so I don't
[34:53] go too long you know we kind of ended
[34:58] son or Wednesday service we did a
[35:00] livestream service because it was so
[35:02] cold we didn't gather here at the church
[35:03] but we kind of ended by looking at three
[35:06] scriptures that talk about purpose and
[35:08] this was the first one you know Acts
[35:10] 1122 where Barnabas a missionary he
[35:14] would revisit he and Paul would revisit
[35:16] the churches they started and in leaving
[35:18] them he would leave these words he would
[35:20] say cleave unto Christ make this your
[35:25] purpose of your heart
[35:26] so Cleaves be so established
[35:29] he's so glued to Christ that everybody
[35:31] knows which side you're on hey men stay
[35:34] that let that be your purpose of your
[35:36] heart I don't want to cleave to anything
[35:38] else other than Christ be cleave to him
[35:42] second we looked at David David said the
[35:44] purpose he said I purpose that my tongue
[35:47] would not speak any iniquity I thought
[35:50] that's a good purpose for us to write so
[35:52] all these purposes work for us as well
[35:54] because you don't want to talk evil then
[35:57] try to come to church and act like
[35:58] you're holy now if you make a mistake
[36:01] and you ask God to forgive you yeah now
[36:03] you're holy again but we don't want to
[36:05] be a hypocrite and say oh I can I can
[36:08] act however I want outside and then as
[36:09] long as I look okay at a church as long
[36:11] as I wear the right clothes everybody
[36:13] thinks I'm okay the Bible said we want
[36:17] to have unfeigned faith that means we
[36:20] don't have to pretend we're not
[36:21] pretending to anybody here what you see
[36:23] here is what you see at my home which is
[36:25] what you see at my job that were just a
[36:28] Christian everywhere we are every day of
[36:30] the week amen
[36:31] and Daniel the third one was Daniel or
[36:33] Daniel said I purposed in my heart that
[36:35] I won't be defile with the Kings meat
[36:38] and that's a great desire if we could
[36:40] have that purpose today the purpose of
[36:42] my life is not to be defiled and Satan's
[36:45] Eden I don't want to be defiled on my
[36:47] phone I don't want to be defiled in my
[36:48] conversations I don't want to be to file
[36:50] in a church I don't want to be defiled
[36:52] anywhere I want to be completely
[36:54] connected to Christ that I live a godly
[36:57] life everywhere I am amen
[36:59] and so we ended with those thoughts
[37:01] there on Wednesday night and I hope that
[37:03] was a blessing to you I like to look at
[37:06] a few more scriptures on purpose because
[37:09] I just went through the Bible I typed in
[37:10] purpose and I just did a study and then
[37:12] went searching for quotes that match
[37:14] those scriptures and of course listening
[37:17] to different sermons so I let's look at
[37:21] purpose a little bit you know if you go
[37:22] to Isaiah you don't have to turn there
[37:23] of course I tried to make it a little
[37:25] easier actually just saves a little more
[37:27] time if I just put them up there if I
[37:29] have the time Isaiah 1 verse 10 hear the
[37:32] word of the Lord ye rulers of Sodom give
[37:34] ear unto the law of our God he people of
[37:36] Gomorrah so Isaiah's prophesy against
[37:38] Sodom and Gomorrah isn't that
[37:40] interesting how Jesus said as it was the
[37:43] days of Sodom so will it be in the days
[37:45] of the coming of the Son of Man so even
[37:47] in Isaiah's day the worshipers in Sodom
[37:50] they were bringing worship to Jehovah
[37:51] Jehovah says that God says that he says
[37:55] what is the purpose is this multitude of
[37:57] sacrifices unto me they weren't bringing
[37:59] just a few sacrifices to Jehovah they
[38:02] were bringing multitudes these people
[38:04] this people didn't stay at home and you
[38:07] know and just avoid worshiping God they
[38:09] came out to church they gave all kinds
[38:11] of sacrifices they killed many animals
[38:14] but gee but God or we say Jesus is
[38:17] spirit or God God said what purpose is
[38:19] all this what's the purpose behind all
[38:22] these burnt offerings I'm full of the
[38:24] burnt offerings of rams and of the fat
[38:27] of the beasts and I delight not in the
[38:29] blood of Bullock's or of the Lambs or of
[38:31] the he-goats what a what an awful thing
[38:33] to have to receive from God through a
[38:36] preacher through a prophet all these
[38:38] people are worshiping and the Prophet
[38:40] comes up and says thus saith the Lord
[38:42] I'm not receiving
[38:44] all your sacrifices what's the purpose
[38:46] of all this sacrifice and they would say
[38:48] Oh to know God to love God to love
[38:50] Jehovah but Isaiah has to keep
[38:53] prophesying to tell them the problem the
[38:56] problem he says his wash you and make
[38:58] you clean so they weren't clean they
[39:00] were bringing sacrifices but they
[39:02] weren't clean oh my we can all come
[39:05] right people we know people come to
[39:06] church or sometimes ourselves we can
[39:08] come to church and offer worship and
[39:10] sacrifice but if we're not clean it's
[39:12] not accepted amen we got to be clean we
[39:16] got to be forgiven we got to have our
[39:18] robes washed in the blood of the Lamb he
[39:21] said put away the evil of your doings
[39:23] before my eyes ceased into even a liquor
[39:25] look at the insanity of this they would
[39:28] do evil all week and then come and
[39:30] worship on the Sabbath and bring their
[39:32] offerings and think that God's going to
[39:34] receive it and God's like not watching
[39:36] you all week you're doing evil you come
[39:40] and praise my name and bring the animal
[39:43] sacrifices you do all these things
[39:44] what's the purpose of Saturday worship
[39:47] if you're not worshiping me on Friday
[39:49] and Thursday amen oh my stop doing evil
[39:54] in other words get a victory get
[39:56] delivered from addictions get delivered
[39:58] from problems you don't have to be a
[40:00] slave to sin we're free by the blood of
[40:03] Christ but you got to accept that
[40:04] freedom amen programs that you can
[40:07] scream at the altar cry pour gallon of
[40:10] oil on somebody but they won't be healed
[40:12] they won't be saved until you accept it
[40:14] we've got to accept that we're free
[40:16] praise God
[40:17] we don't have to be a slave we don't
[40:19] have to keep doing evil we don't have to
[40:21] be addicted we can be free in Christ's
[40:23] name Amen
[40:25] he said see here you got to learn to do
[40:27] well you've you've learned how to bring
[40:30] a public worship to God you've learned
[40:33] how to come to church and act like
[40:34] you're worshiping God but you haven't
[40:36] learned to do good all the rest of the
[40:37] week that's not the kind of life I want
[40:39] church praise the Lord we don't want to
[40:43] pretend life and you know we you know
[40:45] and let me say like this you can learn
[40:47] anything you want to learn if you were
[40:49] anyone to learn God's Word you can do it
[40:51] I'm 38 and I've been learning for my
[40:53] Taekwondo class I've been learning to
[40:55] memorize some of these things now guys
[40:56] help me had a lot of page
[40:58] Saamy now Kai's got like a photographic
[41:00] memory he can read over something and
[41:02] he's got to memorize him like how do you
[41:03] do that so we're finally been going over
[41:05] these things on the drive there and
[41:07] finally after a month I understood one
[41:09] of the Korean words and Malachi's like
[41:11] yeah you got it
[41:12] I'm like it took me a month to get it
[41:15] but in other words the search that's
[41:17] just so like one example if you really
[41:20] want to learn if I really want to learn
[41:22] to live closer to God we can we've just
[41:25] got to sacrifice anything outside during
[41:29] the week that's keeping us from drawing
[41:30] closer to God we got to be in God's
[41:32] presence all the time see they knew how
[41:36] to bring a sacrifice they learn to come
[41:38] to church and make it look like it was
[41:40] okay and everything was fine and dressed
[41:43] holy but when they got home it wasn't
[41:46] that way he said seek judgment relieve
[41:50] the oppressed judge the fatherless plead
[41:52] for the widow and that's that's always
[41:58] my prayer and I pray it from time to
[41:59] time Lord show me the people that are
[42:01] poor that are among us that we can help
[42:03] out and help me to visit the fatherless
[42:07] when I can show me children that don't
[42:10] have a father that we could visit them
[42:11] the Bible said visit them in their
[42:13] affliction plead for the widow Lord show
[42:16] me widows that don't have anything that
[42:18] we can help them we can give them a job
[42:20] or give them a love offering her give
[42:22] them something that should be our desire
[42:25] that's seeking to be a blessing that's
[42:28] seeking to be like God God sends his
[42:29] rain on the just and the unjust and God
[42:32] wants us to be just like him he said
[42:35] come now let us reason together saith
[42:37] the Lord though your sins be as scarlet
[42:38] they shall be as white as snow though
[42:40] they be red like crimson they shall be
[42:42] as wool if you'd be willing and obedient
[42:44] so see they could bring they were so
[42:46] beaded - doing public worship but not
[42:50] obedient to all the other times the rest
[42:52] of the week he shall eat the good of the
[42:58] land but if you refused and rebelled
[43:00] you should be devoured with the sword
[43:01] for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it
[43:04] how is the faithful City becoming a
[43:06] harlot it was full of judgment full of
[43:08] righteousness large in it but now
[43:13] now where this impacts us the murders is
[43:16] people that gossip in message churches
[43:18] that's what churches that's the kind of
[43:19] murderers churches our folk filled with
[43:21] now maybe not physical murders but
[43:23] people that will attack somebody's
[43:25] character attack that pass or attack
[43:27] that you know we just want to attack sin
[43:29] we just want to attack the devil the
[43:31] serpent romance that's striking the
[43:33] people praise God we want to try to not
[43:36] make people look bad but we've got to
[43:38] call outs in the the Bible says rebuke
[43:41] them that sin before all so there's God
[43:44] away there's got to be a way to do it
[43:45] and if the way to do it is with the
[43:47] right heart amen with the right spirit
[43:50] with the desire to help them like this
[43:54] week I've been talking different people
[43:55] you know and it's it's a it's a
[44:00] hypocrisy if I come here and preach
[44:03] against something and I don't talk to
[44:05] the person I know that's doing it it's
[44:06] hypocrisy that's why when I mentioned
[44:09] things about tapes I've reached out to
[44:11] that company I've reached out to those
[44:13] group and I've sent them quotes I've
[44:15] reached out to them I'm trying to help
[44:17] them praise the Lord and so the same is
[44:22] true for us it doesn't do us any good to
[44:24] speak against somebody if we don't have
[44:26] the love in our heart to try to help
[44:27] them out
[44:29] amen but see they could bring all kinds
[44:32] of sacrifices they could come to church
[44:34] they could do all these they could pay
[44:36] their tithes and offerings we'll say
[44:37] they could do all these sacrifices but
[44:40] God was looking for people that would
[44:42] judge the right judgment that would have
[44:45] the right spirit that would learn to do
[44:47] well do things of God all throughout the
[44:50] week I think God's still looking for
[44:51] those don't you jesus said the father's
[44:54] seeking true worshipers amen the next
[45:01] book Isaiah Jeremiah he has the same
[45:03] thing now look at this church they made
[45:05] such a great effort they ordered in
[45:07] incense from Amazon all the way from
[45:11] Sheba I just say like that they they
[45:15] imported all this incense Oh make a
[45:18] special sacrifice to give this to God
[45:21] and then God uses Jeremiah to say it's
[45:24] still the same thing
[45:25] what purpose do you come here with all
[45:29] this incense from Sheba and the sweet
[45:30] came from far country your burnt
[45:32] offerings are not acceptable nor your
[45:34] sacrifice is sweet unto me see God is
[45:36] not so much interested in this the
[45:38] public outward worship God wants every
[45:41] day to be a worship God wants all of our
[45:44] dealings with people in the church with
[45:47] families and and strangers and friends
[45:49] God wants all of our dealings to glorify
[45:52] Him we've got look at every situation of
[45:54] our life as a learning opportunity
[45:57] I hope help me Lord to learn how to be
[46:00] more loving to my wife or my husband
[46:03] whichever are my children help me Lord
[46:05] to be more loving at school help me to
[46:08] be more loving to my brothers and
[46:09] sisters it must be a constant learning
[46:14] how many want to be a learner of Christ
[46:18] so you can ship things in from around
[46:21] the world oh look at I got this here
[46:23] special offering for Jesus but he's
[46:25] looking at your heart he says what
[46:28] purpose is this and if people are going
[46:30] to great lengths to impress God here
[46:32] with their outward worship how much more
[46:34] today if they did it in Jeremiah's day
[46:36] how much more today remember the Bible
[46:40] said they will run to and fro upon the
[46:43] face of the earth they'll fly from
[46:44] America to Europe they'll fly from
[46:47] Europe to Africa trying to do God a
[46:49] service oh look we sacrifice all this
[46:52] unto God it's with the wrong spirit God
[46:56] said what purpose is it what purpose is
[46:59] it it's got to have the right spirit
[47:01] behind it it's got to have the right
[47:03] attitude behind it ask me a daily
[47:05] learning has to be a learners attitude
[47:07] as a Christian that's right
[47:11] so you see as I read the board purpose
[47:13] throughout the Bible these get inspired
[47:15] to me I hope there has been inspiration
[47:17] to you as well by God's grace
[47:20] lamentations he said the same thing now
[47:22] this is of course jeremiah lamenting for
[47:24] the city of jerusalem that's going to be
[47:27] destroyed the lord hath purposed to
[47:29] destroy the wall the daughter of zion he
[47:31] has stretched out of the line he hath
[47:32] not withdrawn his hand from destroying
[47:34] therefore he made the rampart and the
[47:36] wall to lament they languished together
[47:39] her gates are sunken to the ground he
[47:40] had destroyed and broken her bars her
[47:42] King and her princes are among the
[47:44] Gentiles the loss no more her prophets
[47:46] also find no vision from the Lord not so
[47:50] because they rejected Isaiah Jeremiah
[47:53] and you can think of all the prophets
[47:55] that was sent to Israel because they
[47:58] rejected them because they not really
[48:00] examine their purpose for coming to
[48:02] church and their purpose for serving God
[48:05] the purpose for their sacrifices God
[48:07] finally says because you won't listen to
[48:10] my purpose then my purpose is to scatter
[48:12] you and destroy you of course we know he
[48:15] would never forsake his people Israel
[48:17] that's pretty that's pretty humbling and
[48:19] I really don't hear any amens which it
[48:21] makes sense right this is not a fun
[48:24] that's not a fun scripture that's not a
[48:27] it's not a rejoicing scripture but it
[48:29] does show how God is looking at every
[48:32] one of our purposes and if we won't take
[48:33] God's purpose then his purpose will be
[48:36] against us I don't care if a church says
[48:39] we're a messege church that doesn't mean
[48:40] that they're always going to be
[48:41] according to God's purpose we've all
[48:44] seen people that say they're in the
[48:45] message and then live contrary to the
[48:47] Word of God well God's not with that any
[48:49] more than he's with any denomination it
[48:51] the the question is what are you doing
[48:54] with Jesus Christ right now what are we
[48:57] doing with God's Son Jesus Christ so see
[49:04] they couldn't find a vision purpose
[49:06] because they rejected all God's
[49:08] preaching they they're seeking God they
[49:10] can't even find what's my purpose in
[49:12] life what does God want me to do what
[49:15] should my job be my preacher or not my
[49:17] song leader my deacon what am I see
[49:20] because they've rejected God's purpose
[49:22] they don't get a vision from the Lord
[49:24] they don't know what they're called to
[49:26] do in life what a blessing it is to know
[49:28] when you've been called by God and you
[49:30] know God's purpose for your life amen
[49:32] boy what a blessing amen brother and
[49:35] we'll say it later he said everyone that
[49:37] doesn't know they're just drifting from
[49:38] place to place just drifting just
[49:41] drifting wrong not going in a straight
[49:43] line not knowing where they're going the
[49:46] Bible said when you redeem the time the
[49:48] Bible says you walk circumspectly which
[49:51] means exact
[49:52] you're walking exactly where you know
[49:55] you're supposed to be going amen glory
[49:58] you're not walking because well this
[50:00] person said so or that person said so
[50:02] you're walking it exactly you're walking
[50:05] the perfect will of God you're walking
[50:07] the narrow road because God put you on
[50:08] that narrow road amen hallelujah there's
[50:15] a little bit more purpose in worship
[50:16] scriptures that kind of came up so let's
[50:18] look at these here now this is what I
[50:23] kind of mentioned there and I've been
[50:24] mentioning off and on I think I think
[50:26] the purpose behind this purpose
[50:29] series if I can say it like that it's
[50:32] that every one the church will know your
[50:33] purpose like brother Bram said he said
[50:38] if you got a gift of God he said you
[50:40] ought to be just as interested in
[50:41] getting it in order in the house of God
[50:43] as the pastor isn't his and you can ask
[50:46] my wife and children I'm I'm pretty
[50:47] interested in making sure I'm right I'm
[50:49] a good pastor all the time I give to
[50:51] preaching and studying and praying I try
[50:53] to make sure I got my gift in the right
[50:56] position and each one of us must be just
[51:00] as interested in getting your gift in
[51:03] its place in the house of God as I am we
[51:06] in other words we should all have the
[51:07] same desire to be in our position so
[51:11] look what look what the Bible says Paul
[51:14] and I'll Paul's a prophet so this is a
[51:15] prophet verse
[51:16] here's the rest of the congregation at
[51:18] Corinth Corinth rather Paul says what
[51:20] what if I come to you speaking in
[51:22] tongues what should i profit you except
[51:24] I shall speak to you either by
[51:25] revelation knowledge prophecy or
[51:28] doctrine so he said if I come and speak
[51:30] and unknown tongues it doesn't really
[51:32] profit you unless there's one of those
[51:34] four manifestations right now now we
[51:40] know the Corinthian church was very
[51:42] zealous for gifts I don't know too many
[51:45] message churches that are like Corinth
[51:47] that are overly zealous on gifts too
[51:49] much speaking in tongues too much
[51:51] prophesy too much interpretation do you
[51:53] does anybody does anybody know there's
[51:55] not too many that I know of maybe in
[51:57] other countries and maybe in different
[51:59] parts of the nation and so brother
[52:03] Graham does make a point he said they
[52:04] were immature church
[52:06] but they were still a true church and
[52:10] later in the church age book brother
[52:13] branham uses this as an example of how
[52:16] that this church today should be so we
[52:21] can't let one quote from the 58 I think
[52:23] it was or program said see their
[52:25] Corinthian churches of much immature
[52:26] church we can't we got to balance that
[52:28] quote with the quote from the church age
[52:30] book they got to be balanced they got to
[52:31] be understood in their context so he
[52:37] says how is it brethren when ye come
[52:39] together you every one of you have
[52:41] something I just highlighted that half I
[52:43] emphasize that when you come to church
[52:46] when I come to church we've got to bring
[52:48] something remember not like Isaiah's day
[52:52] and Jeremiah's they were they just
[52:54] brought it for show you got to bring the
[52:55] love of God you got to bring an obedient
[52:58] life so everybody came to church they
[53:03] had something that's something to give
[53:06] now we're all going to go through hard
[53:08] times where only reason we come to
[53:09] church is to get something right we're
[53:13] so down and we're so discouraged we just
[53:15] want to get something out of service
[53:18] open hot different Church how different
[53:21] was this Corinthian church they were so
[53:23] on fire they were so excited about God
[53:25] everybody brought something to church
[53:27] amen ohana didya glory look at that
[53:32] everyone in the church that would mean
[53:36] vain that would mean Jose I'm not gonna
[53:39] call the sisters names I'll call the
[53:41] brothers because they can handle it you
[53:43] know they're okay with that
[53:44] I don't want embarrass any sisters so of
[53:47] all the brothers brought a song a song
[53:49] or this brother brought a doctor in all
[53:52] Maya the Lord showed me a doctrine this
[53:55] brother brought a tongue this brother
[53:58] brother revelation Oh God revealed
[54:00] something to me in a dream last night
[54:04] this brother brought an interpretation
[54:06] oh this is what God told me your dream
[54:09] was about this was the interpretation
[54:10] that I think the Lord revealed it to me
[54:11] now wouldn't that be a happy Church how
[54:13] many could say amen to that
[54:15] everybody in church brought something to
[54:18] church
[54:20] and Paul said the same thing I mean I
[54:23] got to bring more than unknown tongue I
[54:25] got a profit you somehow everybody has
[54:30] something to bring now look at these
[54:33] quotes Branham says from the church age
[54:35] book now they the Pentecostals are all
[54:38] saying and trying to prove that they
[54:39] have it all or they have enough yet it
[54:43] is the what I'm sorry yeah is that the
[54:45] truth compared to this 20th century
[54:47] church to the first century church go
[54:49] ahead do that where is the power
[54:51] where's the love where's the purified
[54:54] church that withstood sin and walk with
[54:56] faith toward Jesus where's the unity you
[54:59] can't find it
[55:00] if this church has all it needs why were
[55:02] they crying out for more of God in the
[55:04] book of Acts as though they didn't have
[55:06] it all and yet they had far more than
[55:09] they have today so the Pentecostals are
[55:14] will say the messenger whatever you can
[55:15] say the latest message any church that
[55:18] says we have it all and isn't crying out
[55:22] for more of God is not like the original
[55:24] Church because the original Church went
[55:26] through trials and they cried out for
[55:28] more of God oh can you say amen to that
[55:32] to see we got to come to church and not
[55:34] sit here and just you know not
[55:38] understand what we're supposed to do
[55:39] wisdom tells us we've got to come and
[55:41] craw for more of God it might look
[55:45] different for some than others but let's
[55:47] be honest with ourselves this is what
[55:49] the early church had they cried out for
[55:52] more of God in the book of Acts like
[55:54] they didn't have enough and we've got to
[55:56] come to church every time saying Lord I
[55:59] need more I need more and I'm willing to
[56:01] cry out for it not just go through the
[56:03] motions but I'm willing to cry out for
[56:05] it
[56:06] praise God what does that look like you
[56:09] might cry out worship you might cry out
[56:11] and prayer might cry out during the
[56:13] preaching of the word say Oh God
[56:14] hallelujah but see the early church
[56:17] wanted more of God they were because
[56:19] they had God amen
[56:21] they wouldn't more of God because they
[56:23] were learned again amen and they so they
[56:26] wanted more of God because they had a
[56:28] portion of God but they wanted more of
[56:30] God amen church
[56:33] I hope somebody's hearing me this
[56:35] morning by the grace of God you love the
[56:36] Lord this morning hallelujah
[56:39] now look at this and this is what I'm
[56:42] trying to avoid brother Branham says
[56:44] this I'm trying to avoid this Paul saw
[56:46] it coming but he warned them about this
[56:47] subtle priesthood so there's preachers
[56:50] or tape players either one now because
[56:52] tape players call themselves preachers
[56:54] which that's fine if they want to do
[56:55] that Paul warned them about a subtle
[56:59] preset so ministers that would come and
[57:04] take over with their false doctrines he
[57:07] knew they would implement a way of
[57:09] worship that excluded the people from
[57:12] any part in the Holy Spirit ministry
[57:14] isn't that striking Paul knew this these
[57:18] are called wolves Paul calls them when
[57:21] the wolves come in they try to divide
[57:23] the preachers from the people and say
[57:25] well only the preachers have the
[57:27] anointing on them and we don't really
[57:30] need a ministry from the people listen I
[57:32] hope you believe this but we need your
[57:35] ministry
[57:35] I need your ministry everyone that's a
[57:38] home church here we need your ministry
[57:42] Christianity is not a one-man show or
[57:45] one pastor show or one pastor and three
[57:48] associate preacher show everybody should
[57:52] be moved by God everybody should have a
[57:54] ministry everybody should be led of the
[57:56] Holy Spirit but see the false priesthood
[58:02] will say it's only for us at the pulpit
[58:04] or it's only for brother Branham on the
[58:06] tape or it's only for just preachers
[58:08] that they get you know whatever you
[58:10] understand what I mean they're trying to
[58:13] get the people out of it so the people
[58:15] don't have a ministry and even right
[58:18] today among those who claim to be free
[58:19] how many free and full the Holy Spirit I
[58:21] am
[58:22] are you free amen are you follow
[58:25] hallelujah
[58:26] there's not too much freedom in the
[58:28] laity and the best we can see is a few
[58:31] preachers with inspired preaching while
[58:33] the flock just sits there and tries to
[58:34] absorb it like I said there might be
[58:36] some service that you just try to absorb
[58:38] the preaching but the true church the
[58:42] true pattern of the book of Acts is for
[58:44] every person to have a
[58:47] ministry everybody operating with the
[58:50] holy spirit is that true
[58:56] so the people just sitting there trying
[58:59] to absorb it he said this is a far cry
[59:01] from Paul who said that when all came
[59:05] together all had the leading of the
[59:07] Spirit and all participated in spiritual
[59:11] worship Oh in that glorious
[59:13] what's-what's program I'm talking about
[59:15] he's talked about this right here every
[59:16] one of you have to saw he said when you
[59:19] come together how's the brother when you
[59:20] come together every one of you has a
[59:22] song now that doesn't mean if you have a
[59:27] gift of sing like we know our sister
[59:29] when he sings and brother Jose sings and
[59:30] different ones my wife sings and you
[59:32] know our children sing that doesn't mean
[59:34] every time you come together you have to
[59:36] sing a special that's not what that
[59:37] means but let me balance that out but if
[59:43] you have a gift of God and you just let
[59:45] it go for a couple weeks or three weeks
[59:46] is that as are you just as interested in
[59:50] that gift of singing as the pastor is
[59:52] and making sure his preaching gift is in
[59:54] what in line with the Word of God you
[59:56] see you see how we want to just you see
[1:00:00] how people just want to coast but if
[1:00:04] you've got a genuine gift of God Jesus
[1:00:06] said you've got it take that gift and
[1:00:08] invest it don't bury it in the earth
[1:00:12] don't put it under merit under all these
[1:00:14] other jobs I got to do in other things
[1:00:16] no don't don't bury there dig it back up
[1:00:19] and take it and invest it if you have a
[1:00:23] gift this thing you should practice
[1:00:24] singing during the week you should make
[1:00:26] make a reminder make a simple reminder
[1:00:27] on a piece of paper and say practice a
[1:00:30] song once a week to stay in the channel
[1:00:34] that doesn't mean you have to sing it
[1:00:35] every week but I've got to preach
[1:00:38] sometimes three or five times a week I
[1:00:40] got to stay in that channel praise the
[1:00:42] Lord I'm thankful I have by God's grace
[1:00:46] because it's all God's grace or if you
[1:00:52] got to give
[1:00:53] in tongues like we know our sister Naomi
[1:00:54] does oh you've got other gifts gift of
[1:00:58] healing that we need to pray it's a God
[1:01:00] if there's anyone sick use me this week
[1:01:02] and not just on Sunday morning but pray
[1:01:05] that on Saturday Friday Thursday try to
[1:01:09] find the mommy what the mind of Christ
[1:01:12] see we got to find the mind of Christ
[1:01:16] when they came together everybody had of
[1:01:19] Revelation everybody had a song
[1:01:22] everybody had a leader leading of the
[1:01:24] Holy Spirit praise God what am i trying
[1:01:30] to do as a pastor I've been here almost
[1:01:32] 13 years faithfully what am I trying to
[1:01:34] do I'm just trying to get help people
[1:01:36] catch the vision that's the vision this
[1:01:40] is the vision we're returning to the
[1:01:41] book of Acts church this church started
[1:01:44] Corinthian started in the book of Acts
[1:01:47] Paul Paul started the Corinthian church
[1:01:50] in the book of Acts there a book of Acts
[1:01:53] church yeah they're a little overboard
[1:01:54] on gifts but Paul said writing for this
[1:01:56] he said everybody's got one just let it
[1:01:58] be done decently and in order
[1:02:02] and he said pretty soon a sinner is
[1:02:04] gonna come in and somebody's gonna
[1:02:05] manifest a gift and tell him a seeker of
[1:02:07] their heart and that sinner will fall
[1:02:09] down and say surely God is among you ah
[1:02:12] after we desire amen that's what I
[1:02:15] desire but everybody brought something
[1:02:18] everybody has something everybody has
[1:02:21] something to bring that's their purpose
[1:02:24] so what is our way of worship buh-bam
[1:02:27] said they'll try to change the way of
[1:02:29] worship is our way of worship is to let
[1:02:31] brother Jesse or brother brother cam
[1:02:34] comes next or later this month just let
[1:02:36] him have all the leading of the Spirit I
[1:02:38] hope that's not our our worship because
[1:02:43] that was the question God asked Israel
[1:02:44] what's the purpose of all these
[1:02:45] sacrifices you came to church you got up
[1:02:48] you washed your hair you brushed your
[1:02:49] teeth put on your tie you put gel up a
[1:02:51] jump hair well what's the purpose of all
[1:02:53] this worship unless God's will is done
[1:02:57] amen what is our way of worship and I
[1:03:02] know church that's why I'm not trying to
[1:03:03] get discouraged I'm not discouraging
[1:03:04] anybody here I'm saying this is the
[1:03:06] vision
[1:03:06] this is where we're all going toward
[1:03:08] praise God we are moving our churches
[1:03:11] moving toward that way no matter how
[1:03:13] small doesn't matter the number Jesus
[1:03:15] said little flock it doesn't matter but
[1:03:17] I feel that the Holy Spirit that's this
[1:03:19] is the direction we're going where
[1:03:21] everybody's letter the Holy Spirit
[1:03:22] everybody has a gift of God
[1:03:24] everybody loves Jesus Christ everybody
[1:03:27] wants to manifest God's presence that's
[1:03:29] the direction I want to go I don't want
[1:03:31] to go that direction we're only the
[1:03:32] preachers got an anointing I want to go
[1:03:34] in this direction where everybody has a
[1:03:36] leadership of the Holy Spirit hallelujah
[1:03:41] because that's what the message says
[1:03:44] that's what the Bible says and so our
[1:03:50] worship must be purposeful look how look
[1:03:55] how much Jesus magnified Mary's worship
[1:03:59] remember Mary came six days before Jesus
[1:04:01] crucifixion to anoint him notice
[1:04:04] anointed on the sixth day before
[1:04:07] crucifixion six is the number of man the
[1:04:11] number of and it can be anointed man
[1:04:13] because Adam was anointed with the Holy
[1:04:15] Spirit when he was created Jesus gets
[1:04:18] anointed six days before he dies oh I'd
[1:04:22] love to see God's numerology don't you
[1:04:24] you can see the meaning behind this amen
[1:04:26] but look what Bob Arum said and Jesus
[1:04:29] said let her alone Mary for she did this
[1:04:31] she anointed him unto his burial see
[1:04:34] this woman so grateful that her sins
[1:04:35] were forgiven until she spent all of her
[1:04:38] money she had you know I looked that up
[1:04:40] church it was one year's income so if
[1:04:43] you make thirty thousand if you make
[1:04:44] forty thousand if you make fifty sixty
[1:04:47] seventy however much you make eighty
[1:04:48] ninety one hundred
[1:04:50] she brought a year's income bought the
[1:04:55] alabaster box and broke it and poured it
[1:04:58] all on Jesus and you just said all kind
[1:05:02] of what purpose is this waste for you
[1:05:09] think
[1:05:11] do you think paying $10,000 or send a
[1:05:13] missionary to the Philippines would be a
[1:05:17] waste no I'd be a great that'd be a
[1:05:19] great sacrifice
[1:05:20] oh they spent $20,000 to to read through
[1:05:26] outreach and and win souls for God is
[1:05:29] that a bad thing I think that's a good
[1:05:30] thing if it's done with the right
[1:05:32] intentions don't you church a whole year
[1:05:35] of her wages six days and brother
[1:05:40] branham said she did not even know what
[1:05:44] she was doing that's how that's how we
[1:05:46] need to be amen we need to be sowing the
[1:05:48] holy spirit don't we don't even know
[1:05:50] what we're doing we're just led by God
[1:05:52] amen we're just led by God to worship
[1:05:54] and love God and make sacrifices and
[1:05:57] serve God
[1:05:58] I'm just led to go annoy and worship
[1:06:00] Jesus I don't even know what I'm doing I
[1:06:03] just found the leadership with a heart
[1:06:04] we need some Holy Ghost those things
[1:06:06] like that amen hallelujah and you've
[1:06:09] probably been like that before what I'm
[1:06:11] saying is we didn't let that continue we
[1:06:13] didn't see that increase she's just
[1:06:15] anointed and she's out of her mind she's
[1:06:17] in the Christ mind amen she spent all of
[1:06:22] her money that she had and took an
[1:06:23] alabaster box broke it poured the oil
[1:06:25] and just ordered the room with fine
[1:06:28] smell this myrrh that she had anointed
[1:06:30] him for his death now see she did the
[1:06:34] service not knowing what she was doing
[1:06:36] she was so grateful to God notice she
[1:06:41] was grateful that Lazarus was raised
[1:06:44] from the dead when she that's her
[1:06:46] brother thank God
[1:06:48] you raised my brother Lazarus from the
[1:06:51] grave but brother man said what she was
[1:06:53] really thankful for was being forgiving
[1:06:55] of her sins George we all be so thankful
[1:06:59] to be justified by the blood of Jesus
[1:07:02] amen
[1:07:04] she'd seen a miracle we've seen how many
[1:07:07] seen in America anybody raise your hands
[1:07:08] ever seen a miracle praise God but
[1:07:10] that's not why she did it she did it
[1:07:13] because she was thankful that Jesus had
[1:07:16] forgiven her sins
[1:07:17] oh it ought to be joy unspeakable to us
[1:07:19] this morning Church being forgiven have
[1:07:23] the shirts are going to heaven there
[1:07:25] ought to be joy unspeakable for the
[1:07:27] Bride of Christ ha ha
[1:07:29] Laurie amen did he know what she was
[1:07:32] doing I'm so caught up in the Holy
[1:07:35] Spirit I really don't know what I'm
[1:07:36] doing I'm just worshipping Jesus oh my
[1:07:40] god help us Church god help us to be
[1:07:42] true worshippers how I'm gonna be a
[1:07:43] purposeful worshiper
[1:07:45] well one time just get so grateful to
[1:07:47] God and see what happens to us
[1:07:49] let's just get so happy so grateful so
[1:07:52] thankful to be justified forgiven see
[1:07:54] what happens Oh hallelujah
[1:07:58] see Judas said what purpose is this
[1:08:01] you're wasting you're wasting a whole
[1:08:03] year of your work you've worked for a
[1:08:06] whole year you're taking that money and
[1:08:08] your tummy you're just gonna pour it out
[1:08:10] right here on Jesus remember he's
[1:08:12] anointed on the 6th day before he was
[1:08:15] crucified
[1:08:16] that's because number 6 is the number of
[1:08:18] man as we've been looking at there's 6
[1:08:21] pieces of armor on the armor of God
[1:08:22] praise the Lord 6 is the number of
[1:08:27] fallen man of course but also anointed
[1:08:29] man and Jesus said she hath wrought a
[1:08:34] good work upon me she did it for see
[1:08:38] there's a purpose behind it she did it
[1:08:39] for my burial and then Jesus promised
[1:08:43] this will be unforgettable this was such
[1:08:46] a loving act of worship she just want to
[1:08:49] show how grateful she was I'll spend a
[1:08:52] year of my wages now I can't imagine
[1:08:54] that that's I've never done that I've
[1:08:57] given a whole year of my wages in order
[1:09:02] to magnify Christ or just anoint Christ
[1:09:04] just tell Jesus how much you love him
[1:09:09] and Jesus said the preachers will never
[1:09:13] forget about this there was gonna preach
[1:09:14] on this woman she made such a great
[1:09:17] sacrifice so see sisters don't don't
[1:09:20] feel bad all gi-du just be grateful to
[1:09:22] Jesus you know don't feel bad you don't
[1:09:24] preach or don't feel bad about this or
[1:09:25] that just be grateful and worship Jesus
[1:09:29] God will see it God sees all of our
[1:09:32] worship
[1:09:36] now just as a reminder remember the
[1:09:38] Passover lamb was it was taken on the
[1:09:40] tenth day was taken in the house and
[1:09:42] kept to the fourteenth day the 14 day of
[1:09:45] Nisan it was killed and you can find
[1:09:47] that in Exodus chapter 12 so on the
[1:09:50] tenth day the Passover lamb was selected
[1:09:52] which is Christ I think Christ in
[1:09:53] Jerusalem I'm not sure that's why I put
[1:09:55] a question mark there that was the
[1:09:56] Monday and then Friday he was taken and
[1:10:00] crucified Saturday was the feast of
[1:10:02] unleavened bread Christ was conquering
[1:10:04] hell and on the 16th he rose on the
[1:10:07] third day I could be wrong on that but
[1:10:11] that's what it seems like now this was
[1:10:14] the day then-mayor and anoint Jesus six
[1:10:16] days before the bout was that six days
[1:10:18] before Passover one two three four five
[1:10:20] six on that Saturday on that Sabbath day
[1:10:23] she comes in anoint Jesus the next day
[1:10:26] Jesus he's anointed right he's anointed
[1:10:30] he goes and they have Palm Sunday they
[1:10:32] say Hosanna Hosanna save us save us
[1:10:36] hosanna in the highest
[1:10:37] and then he stays then the tenth day
[1:10:40] he's what does he do he stays in
[1:10:41] Jerusalem this whole week so the tenth
[1:10:43] day fits the type there where they take
[1:10:45] the lamb they got to judge the lamb they
[1:10:47] got a watch they got to work with the
[1:10:48] lamb examine the lamb and then they take
[1:10:50] it in on the tenth day so Jesus was
[1:10:53] taken in to Jerusalem on the tenth day
[1:10:55] of course we know the Lord's Supper was
[1:10:58] on Thursday then Friday he was crucified
[1:11:00] and it fits the type so Mary had a
[1:11:04] perfect idea here to prepare him for his
[1:11:08] barrows bear was coming up seven days
[1:11:10] later seven days later so she had to
[1:11:14] anoint him in order to be have the
[1:11:17] sacrifice ready to go into Jerusalem and
[1:11:19] be accepted and then to be kept in the
[1:11:22] house of Jerusalem so not even knowing
[1:11:26] it she was just so grateful to God just
[1:11:28] one to worship God with a pure heart
[1:11:31] she felt light into God's plan for the
[1:11:34] Passover lamb
[1:11:35] mine in that striking when your hearts
[1:11:39] just in love with God and God lets your
[1:11:41] worship just fall right in his perfect
[1:11:42] plan just had to be at that right exact
[1:11:45] time just at the perfect time I was so
[1:11:47] grateful to God I was so happy to God
[1:11:49] I just want to show my appreciation to
[1:11:51] God you know fall right exactly in the
[1:11:53] perfect timing of God now getting back
[1:11:59] to this edifying Paul Scylla every
[1:12:01] everything be done to edifying this is
[1:12:03] the act of building up this is someone
[1:12:07] who promotes another's growth we're
[1:12:10] getting back to our purpose now when you
[1:12:12] edify someone here at the church you
[1:12:15] help them grow in wisdom piety happiness
[1:12:19] or holiness that's what the Bible said
[1:12:25] let all things be done unto edifying so
[1:12:29] I just made this so according to 1st
[1:12:32] Corinthians 14 26 every one of them
[1:12:36] brought one of these five things either
[1:12:38] brought a psalm a doctrine a tongue a
[1:12:41] revelation or interpretation that would
[1:12:43] promote growth and other people by
[1:12:45] making them more wise pious happy or
[1:12:50] holy now as a preacher I get to see this
[1:12:55] quite often I'll preach a revelation or
[1:12:57] a doctrine you know I've never spoken in
[1:13:00] tongues I've never gave interpretation
[1:13:04] sometimes I sing a song then people
[1:13:06] might like it I don't know I haven't
[1:13:08] heard one of those lately but I know
[1:13:11] doctrines and revelations I've preached
[1:13:13] have helped people and it's given them
[1:13:16] more wisdom piety happiness made them
[1:13:18] more holy if they obey it you got to
[1:13:21] obey it remember like jesus said you can
[1:13:24] rejoice for a season but then when
[1:13:26] offenses come you get offended you know
[1:13:30] so see this is what the early church
[1:13:32] brought and this is the vision church
[1:13:35] where you and I are this church of Akron
[1:13:37] this is what we need to do we have need
[1:13:39] we need to have this vision this is
[1:13:41] where we need to go and the church said
[1:13:42] all right good I heard a few amens from
[1:13:45] our church this is where we need to go
[1:13:49] your worship that you bring you have to
[1:13:52] bring something most of the time right I
[1:13:54] know if you're battling or struggling at
[1:13:56] least bring yours I guess yeah bring
[1:13:58] yourself at least that's the first thing
[1:13:59] just to get to the house of God this is
[1:14:01] a hospital at least if you're
[1:14:03] sake just get to the hospital not for
[1:14:05] visit physically sick and contagious you
[1:14:07] better pray about it first
[1:14:08] you know what he's spreading your germs
[1:14:10] around here but have you got leading of
[1:14:13] the Lord then you come in other words
[1:14:17] what I mean is don't get in the habit of
[1:14:19] well I missed this time I'll miss I'll
[1:14:21] skip next time pretty soon you're never
[1:14:22] to be in church now that doesn't affect
[1:14:24] most people here most people here are
[1:14:25] very faithful Saints we thank God for
[1:14:27] that but see this is what I was saying
[1:14:31] on Wednesday you have to have such a
[1:14:32] purpose in our hearts that I'm gonna
[1:14:36] company I'm gonna pray all the rest of
[1:14:37] the week Fridays Wednesday Thursday
[1:14:39] Friday said I'm gonna pray that I can
[1:14:41] bring a psalm to church or see if God
[1:14:43] will anoint me to bring a song to
[1:14:45] worship or I'm gonna pray and say God do
[1:14:48] you want to give a little doctrine and
[1:14:49] maybe if your sister maybe just
[1:14:51] mentioned to brother Jesse brother Jesse
[1:14:52] have you ever seen this quote before not
[1:14:54] try to preach at me or teach me but just
[1:14:56] maybe God gives you a word I never
[1:14:57] studied I like to study that that
[1:14:59] doesn't happen too much but sometimes
[1:15:02] sisters will send me interesting things
[1:15:03] I like looking at him or her tongue
[1:15:06] maybe God would have me speaking of
[1:15:07] tongue or revelation maybe God would
[1:15:10] reveal something to me I never knew
[1:15:13] before and we got these nice little
[1:15:17] slips out there we don't want to forget
[1:15:18] about him but you can just put a little
[1:15:20] testimony check on there and share a
[1:15:21] little revelation that God gave you now
[1:15:23] make sure you got two or three witnesses
[1:15:24] that's right because you don't want
[1:15:26] embarrass yourself and put a revelation
[1:15:27] on there it comes out that it's wrong
[1:15:29] later you really want to make sure it's
[1:15:31] God but how many times and we read a
[1:15:34] testimony we're so encouraged oh thank
[1:15:36] the Lord sister Connie what a wonderful
[1:15:37] testimony Oh Wendy thank the Lord God
[1:15:39] gave her testimony see maybe God gave
[1:15:42] you a revelation of something and when
[1:15:46] you do that when you bring something
[1:15:48] when I bring something to the house of
[1:15:51] God it actually promotes or builds up
[1:15:53] your wisdom now you're more wise because
[1:15:55] of that I like this one I'm more happy
[1:15:58] on Monday because of what you brought to
[1:16:00] church and that hat that's happened many
[1:16:02] times some people have sang songs I've
[1:16:04] just so been so happy or rejoiced when
[1:16:06] people hear testimonies you know God let
[1:16:09] the paper work for SIA and they only go
[1:16:11] through you know if they're I don't
[1:16:13] remember the names of that what's the
[1:16:14] name of that green
[1:16:16] that just makes me happy that's a
[1:16:19] testimony
[1:16:20] you know maybe to them it was a
[1:16:21] revelation or maybe God interpreted
[1:16:24] their situation for them but see these
[1:16:27] when we just share these things when we
[1:16:28] bring something the house of God it
[1:16:30] promotes growth it encourages happiness
[1:16:34] it makes you want to live closer to God
[1:16:36] amen hallelujah Laurie it's you know
[1:16:45] it's like that little it's like a little
[1:16:47] illustration of Legos right I teach
[1:16:50] first grade I see kids do it all the
[1:16:51] time they just want to build a tower
[1:16:53] pink mr. Smith look at my tower like
[1:16:56] that's pretty tall wonderful but then
[1:17:00] that's what our spiritual life should be
[1:17:03] God give me another brick give me
[1:17:05] another tower or give me another height
[1:17:07] let me go to new heights build up my
[1:17:09] wisdom build up my faith build up my
[1:17:11] happiness make me more Harley build me
[1:17:13] up in the Lord Jesus Christ they say
[1:17:17] Jesus look at look at what you've done
[1:17:19] in my life that's what we'll say Jesus
[1:17:21] look what you've done into my life thank
[1:17:22] you for building me up amen
[1:17:24] hallelujah brother hamster the holy
[1:17:29] spirit watches your life and then he go
[1:17:31] reports it to the Father now we know
[1:17:34] they're the one himself same person but
[1:17:36] he's dramatizing it Oh Lord look what
[1:17:38] you've done in my life I thank you for
[1:17:40] what you've done you build up you've got
[1:17:42] me to get many victories thank you Lord
[1:17:45] now part of me which wants to make a
[1:17:48] picture of this I want to just slap it
[1:17:49] on the wall maybe I got room up here
[1:17:51] maybe R where would be a good spot maybe
[1:17:53] right under here under the Lord Jesus I
[1:17:55] feel like that's what Jesus is
[1:17:57] encouraging us to do we need to bring
[1:17:59] something to church well the parent said
[1:18:03] what a far cry today's church is from
[1:18:06] the early church where not only the
[1:18:09] preachers had a leading of the Lord but
[1:18:11] everybody had a leading of the Lord that
[1:18:16] makes me happy that makes me smile I
[1:18:18] just can't help it I look forward
[1:18:20] brother banging to that time okay I look
[1:18:22] forward to that time when we're so close
[1:18:24] to the coming of Lord that everyone God
[1:18:27] is getting he's restoring his book of
[1:18:29] Acts church and
[1:18:30] everybody's company Church with some
[1:18:32] type of leading of the Lord oh my would
[1:18:36] that be glorious but it takes a
[1:18:40] sacrifice throughout the week and on
[1:18:43] Sunday and on Sunday takes a sacrifice
[1:18:47] all week where we learn all week or what
[1:18:50] do you what song do you want me to sing
[1:18:51] what doctrine are you dealing with me on
[1:18:53] what what revelation what dream have you
[1:18:56] answered her what tongue or
[1:18:58] interpretation you want to give it's
[1:18:59] been a long time since we had one of
[1:19:00] those but that's okay everybody knows
[1:19:03] what I'm saying that we need to find a
[1:19:04] Leedy leadership of the Holy Spirit that
[1:19:07] will promote the church in these areas
[1:19:12] that's what I'm interested in I'm not
[1:19:15] interesting to come to church to
[1:19:16] fighting against the church up north or
[1:19:18] fighting against the church I don't want
[1:19:19] to fight against them I want to fight
[1:19:20] against the devil and brother Branham
[1:19:22] said these gifts clean out the church
[1:19:24] and fight off the devil the gifts church
[1:19:28] or keep the church clean clean from what
[1:19:30] satan's defilement amen that's what I'm
[1:19:34] interested in the church being undefiled
[1:19:38] walking in the purity the piety the
[1:19:40] happiness of the Holy Spirit the hope
[1:19:45] church I hope you'll take this as you'll
[1:19:48] receive this say this is a vision this
[1:19:49] is part of the vision we we want
[1:19:52] everyone the church to bring something
[1:19:54] to church that will promote and build up
[1:19:59] at other people I hope that hope that
[1:20:02] sinks right now down into your heart I
[1:20:04] hope the Holy Spirit writes that upon
[1:20:06] the fleshly tables of your heart because
[1:20:09] that's what's on my heart that's what
[1:20:11] the Holy Spirit wrote on my heart we
[1:20:16] don't want to bring a critical many
[1:20:18] churches have this now not our church
[1:20:20] God has really clean out our church you
[1:20:21] I mean you that's been here you know the
[1:20:23] testimonies God is really not our church
[1:20:25] but see many churches have that people
[1:20:28] bring a critical or unbelieving spirit
[1:20:30] and we've got to be hungry for God's
[1:20:32] Word you know we got to come if we if
[1:20:35] we're bringing something that will be to
[1:20:37] God will be hungry also to hear from God
[1:20:39] Oh
[1:20:43] you love Jesus man just I can't stop
[1:20:45] smiling today I'm just I'm just so happy
[1:20:47] this is what God is leading us to do now
[1:20:51] we just got old man we just got to act
[1:20:52] on it and I'll keep your mind you don't
[1:20:55] worry I'll keep reminding you I'm gonna
[1:20:58] keep preaching this every now and then
[1:21:00] I'll bring it back up preaches a few
[1:21:01] years ago I'll bring it back in a few
[1:21:03] years again because it's my duty it's my
[1:21:07] job to promote your growth so you keep
[1:21:09] growing that's my job
[1:21:11] feed the flock of God who saw that on
[1:21:13] Wednesday to remember Peters ministry
[1:21:15] went from fish sting to feeding first he
[1:21:18] was a Fisher man for three and a half
[1:21:20] years and then jesus said now feed him
[1:21:22] you went fishing
[1:21:23] now feed him and that's my job now I
[1:21:26] went fishing for some of you like amen
[1:21:28] and bang and I guess Devon and I tried
[1:21:30] to do doing Devon rather I tried to
[1:21:34] bring him in but see now you got to feed
[1:21:37] him once you fish him thank God got the
[1:21:39] fish now feed him actually go from fish
[1:21:42] to lambs I guess now let I mentioned
[1:21:47] this a few months ago remember this
[1:21:48] quote I don't know if you're not now he
[1:21:51] said you're sick in trouble can you
[1:21:52] imagine I'm sorry could you imagine why
[1:21:55] how how you would want to take my place
[1:21:57] standing here now and know that here's
[1:21:59] some between five and six thousand
[1:22:01] people perhaps setting here in every eye
[1:22:03] on you and in there you can feel the
[1:22:05] cold waves of a skeptic spirit and
[1:22:08] everything moving in now how many have
[1:22:12] been by the ocean side and felt the tide
[1:22:14] come in I felt that just recently last
[1:22:17] year we're out in California some Island
[1:22:20] I forget the name of it my mind would
[1:22:21] remember I always forget but we we saw
[1:22:24] the tide was out like wow look at the
[1:22:26] waters out but then you felt it coming
[1:22:27] in you felt that warm area or the cold
[1:22:31] air rather this is my brother branham
[1:22:33] experience and church this is what all
[1:22:34] the preachers have to deal with too
[1:22:36] right and you might have to bow this
[1:22:38] like if you're at a family convention or
[1:22:40] a family gathering or something maybe a
[1:22:43] certain family will arrive everything is
[1:22:44] good in the Holy Spirit then a certain
[1:22:46] family member who arrived and it feels
[1:22:49] like a cold whoosh there's a certain
[1:22:52] person our job every time they walk into
[1:22:54] a meeting if it's happy meeting all of a
[1:22:56] sudden goes whoosh
[1:22:57] and cold waves of skepticism company
[1:23:00] it's nothing about the during church
[1:23:02] it's nothing but the truth but we
[1:23:05] shouldn't bring in cold skeptic I'm not
[1:23:07] on a be here we should bring in a warmth
[1:23:10] a warm spirit loving spirit open spirit
[1:23:16] to receive open to receiving from God
[1:23:18] open to giving to God everybody has
[1:23:22] something so brother am said when when
[1:23:24] unbelievers are here it's like cold
[1:23:26] waves coming in and I hate the cold
[1:23:28] water I'm the last one in the cold water
[1:23:31] at the ocean I know I'd rather just
[1:23:32] stand up on the sand I don't want to
[1:23:34] touch that cold water how much more do I
[1:23:36] not want to be in a church where cold
[1:23:37] water come are you with me just like you
[1:23:41] you don't wanna be in a cold service
[1:23:42] everybody's would you just finish up
[1:23:45] already
[1:23:47] what do you mean he's the same if only
[1:23:50] we were in brother branham's day then we
[1:23:51] could have some holy ghost movie I don't
[1:23:53] want that kind of that that's a cold
[1:23:54] cold wave I don't want the cool wave I
[1:23:57] want the wave of warmth where all things
[1:23:59] are possible Jesus Christ is the same
[1:24:01] yesterday today and forever amen that's
[1:24:05] a warm wave of faith coming in I know
[1:24:08] he's here I know he's faithful
[1:24:10] I know his runner can't failure I know
[1:24:11] he loves me Amen I know he's the same
[1:24:14] today brother Ram said keep Majid I got
[1:24:17] 6,000 people and I feel the waves of
[1:24:19] cold coming in they don't believe they
[1:24:24] don't believe Christ is there they think
[1:24:26] it's some mind-reader
[1:24:30] Satan Russell's demon powers are moving
[1:24:33] in so they move in like a cold army
[1:24:38] marching slowly into the service to try
[1:24:42] to make it a cold cold service but the
[1:24:44] remnants of their cold
[1:24:45] he said the Christians warm amen glory
[1:24:49] amen
[1:24:51] you ought to know how you feel
[1:24:53] just cold wave after wave then here
[1:24:57] comes faith moving in and then here
[1:24:59] comes a cold wave moving in waves
[1:25:03] channels just like the radio whatever
[1:25:05] television television is waves and
[1:25:07] materializes as the waves are brought in
[1:25:09] on a
[1:25:10] certain kind of crystal or whatever it
[1:25:12] is I hope you're sending a wave of faith
[1:25:16] this morning that's what I'm trying to
[1:25:18] send to Jesus a wave I believe I believe
[1:25:21] if I'll pray for somebody I believe I'll
[1:25:23] answer the prayer I believe God will
[1:25:25] answer these prayer requests we wrote
[1:25:26] down here if not then it was just a cold
[1:25:28] wave of icy cold demon demon powers
[1:25:32] moving in well I don't know if I should
[1:25:33] pray for this or not see how that's a
[1:25:35] cold a cold wave that's a it's a
[1:25:38] unbelief attitude we've got to be warm
[1:25:41] we got to say Jesus forgive us now Lord
[1:25:43] answer every prayer we know all things
[1:25:46] are possible we know we have access to
[1:25:48] the Father through the son by the blood
[1:25:50] of Jesus Christ so does the and so does
[1:25:58] the power of Almighty God materialized
[1:25:59] vision materialized in front of you just
[1:26:01] like radio just like tells me if God has
[1:26:04] called you to do so you believe that it
[1:26:05] does it's proof I'm going to ask you to
[1:26:07] be just as quiet as you can and don't
[1:26:09] stir around because you're certainly an
[1:26:11] interference to the ways he says now we
[1:26:17] got to balance that out you know because
[1:26:18] we know people sometimes have to get out
[1:26:20] and use the restroom but what he means
[1:26:23] is you got to sit there and be reverent
[1:26:24] if you got to use the restroom go use
[1:26:25] the restroom but come back and be
[1:26:27] reverent like brother BAM said teenagers
[1:26:31] passing notes and joking around and
[1:26:33] chewing gum and popping jokes and
[1:26:35] popping gum whatever see you'll break up
[1:26:39] the waves we're trying to get ways from
[1:26:41] God this morning aren't you trying to
[1:26:42] get away from God a wave of faith a way
[1:26:46] of of anointing a warm wave now programs
[1:26:50] do the prayer line I'm skipping this to
[1:26:52] get right to the quote he said now she
[1:26:54] she said now right now you feel a real
[1:26:57] sweet warm spirit if that's right raise
[1:27:00] up your hands cuz you are a Christian so
[1:27:04] unbelief is this cold I don't want to
[1:27:06] hear nothing about it stop talking about
[1:27:08] it who are you what you're barking up
[1:27:10] the wrong tree
[1:27:11] all those cold waves of unbelief but
[1:27:15] faith waves are warm and they build you
[1:27:17] up and they make you feel at home and
[1:27:19] they make you love being at church
[1:27:21] like you love being here because Christ
[1:27:23] is here he said you ever see a picture
[1:27:29] that light that pillar of light fire the
[1:27:31] pillar of light in the picture we got it
[1:27:32] here it's taken all over the world we
[1:27:34] got them right here at the building now
[1:27:35] you ever seen it alright that lights
[1:27:37] hanging right between me and the woman
[1:27:39] right now I'm looking right at it
[1:27:42] that's why it was warm there because the
[1:27:44] Holy Spirit was there how many want the
[1:27:46] friends the Lord here today warm not
[1:27:49] cold skeptic upset frustrated critical
[1:27:56] unbelieving but believing warm happy
[1:28:00] thankful full of the wisdom of God full
[1:28:03] of the mercy and the love of God that's
[1:28:05] what we want today now that's another
[1:28:11] quote about that so bro Graham tells us
[1:28:14] now there's a lady she's prayed for God
[1:28:16] told her she'd come she cut sheet I'm
[1:28:19] sure she'd get to come and get to see me
[1:28:21] here just keep believing that's lovely
[1:28:22] if you can keep that up that real wave
[1:28:25] of faith coming off from the audience
[1:28:27] then that's good so you keep that
[1:28:28] thinking now just keep believing don't
[1:28:30] doubt keep it in your heart now you've
[1:28:33] got to keep doing it so all throughout
[1:28:34] the surface I hope God is is teaching us
[1:28:36] that for this service but also for
[1:28:38] Wednesday - you've got to keep I know
[1:28:40] it's and I know stuff I know stuff I've
[1:28:42] sat there on the Pew - I listen to
[1:28:44] preachers you've got to keep that
[1:28:46] attitude like oh god is here all things
[1:28:48] are possible Christ is here to help
[1:28:50] people Jesus can do something I believe
[1:28:52] this is going to be a good service God's
[1:28:54] going to move and then the service God's
[1:28:55] gonna help somebody you've got it we've
[1:28:57] got to keep that attitude that's the way
[1:28:59] we keep the warm waves flowing did you
[1:29:02] see that a couple years ago I saw it on
[1:29:04] Facebook these these men and women
[1:29:05] scientists were so happy they had this
[1:29:07] machine called a wave machine they just
[1:29:09] push this button and it makes a natural
[1:29:11] wave and they were so happy they're like
[1:29:13] oh my we've been doing we just made a
[1:29:15] perfect way just like the ocean and
[1:29:17] somebody put under there on Facebook
[1:29:19] they said they think they're so great
[1:29:20] guys been doing that for 6,000 years
[1:29:23] like we made a wave but church in all
[1:29:28] reality that's what a lot of people do
[1:29:30] today they just do a man-made wave
[1:29:34] while they try to pretend like we'll try
[1:29:37] to get this thing going
[1:29:38] let's try to get this wave going Oh Lord
[1:29:43] Jesus but a real wave of God is produced

[1:32:55] leadership of the Lord now I'm just
[1:32:59] gonna skip right to this I'm gonna skip
[1:33:01] a few quotes because I'm already at an
[1:33:03] hour and I don't want to wear myself out
[1:33:04] yeah look at all those quotes I got 12
[1:33:06] quotes there 14 okay I'm skipping right
[1:33:12] to this guy right here
[1:33:13] I'm skipping right to this guy you like
[1:33:16] that guy he
[1:33:21] at 56 years old just like brother
[1:33:23] branham I'm gonna remind you of that if
[1:33:25] you haven't seen that before brother man
[1:33:28] makes a staggering statement about
[1:33:29] Abraham Lincoln about his purpose in
[1:33:31] life to me it just staggered me I'm like
[1:33:34] wow I was thankful I was listening to it
[1:33:37] because I've been studying on purpose
[1:33:39] and he makes a important statement about
[1:33:42] Abraham Lincoln's purpose in life doors
[1:33:45] and a door he said I was reading the
[1:33:49] story 100 days of our noble one of the
[1:33:50] greatest presence I think the nation
[1:33:51] ever had was Lincoln not because it he
[1:33:53] comes from Kentucky the same state his
[1:33:56] brother branham but because he was a
[1:34:00] great man he was deprived of an
[1:34:03] education but yet was something in his
[1:34:08] heart some purpose God chose a man with
[1:34:14] no education to free all the African
[1:34:18] American slaves well the only way he
[1:34:23] could do that would be to get an
[1:34:25] education but he has none how was he
[1:34:30] gonna do that then is he gonna sit back
[1:34:33] and his lazy labor to see and lazy boys
[1:34:35] say okay God go do it no it'd be the
[1:34:37] same as Joshua you go possess the land
[1:34:40] footstep by footstep every day Lincoln
[1:34:43] you go possess the land see God put
[1:34:46] something in Abraham Lincoln's heart
[1:34:47] that he just couldn't get away from it
[1:34:50] was his purpose in life he had 56 years
[1:34:54] glory to accomplish his purpose amen
[1:34:57] only 56 but if he could be faithful with
[1:35:00] this then God would exalt him and reward
[1:35:03] him in heaven hey man I believe God will
[1:35:06] by God's grace hallelujah there was
[1:35:12] something
[1:35:13] in his heart some purpose what is my
[1:35:16] purpose in life he sound like a man of
[1:35:19] vision see he saw what we hear what he
[1:35:22] was supposed to do in life he saw it way
[1:35:23] off
[1:35:24] I like people that's got something
[1:35:26] they're fighting for not just lay around
[1:35:28] and say well every what comes along
[1:35:31] that'll be alright it sounds like Eeyore
[1:35:34] right we got a lot of yours around the
[1:35:38] world around the message maybe well God
[1:35:42] ever does anything in my life maybe
[1:35:44] it'll happen or what are you doing about
[1:35:46] it
[1:35:48] what are you doing about it he said o
[1:35:54] beat up and add it and Lincoln never let
[1:35:59] his education stand in the way he had
[1:36:03] something to do and I think just the
[1:36:05] Christian preachers ought to be the same
[1:36:07] way find your purpose and go do is that
[1:36:10] what the quote says just the preachers
[1:36:12] Oh
[1:36:16] every Christian ought to be the same way
[1:36:20] find your purpose in life and go do it
[1:36:26] your purpose will never break God's word
[1:36:29] never
[1:36:32] every member of this businessmen's
[1:36:34] chapter and just not well we'll have a
[1:36:36] breakfast once a month maybe we'll do
[1:36:38] that once a month that isn't it or once
[1:36:41] every Saturday we'll have a breakfast he
[1:36:43] said have a purpose in life something
[1:36:46] you're going to do
[1:36:48] let's God has placed you here do
[1:36:51] something about it every member of just
[1:36:54] some churches every church you like that
[1:36:59] Lydia you like that quote every member
[1:37:01] of every Tenex that includes everybody
[1:37:04] right everybody needs to know their
[1:37:07] purpose know their gifts invest in them
[1:37:10] and bring that sacrifice unto God bring
[1:37:14] that offering unto God God place you
[1:37:18] this is if there's a revival in town
[1:37:20] that revival is there for a purpose
[1:37:21] let's get something out of it let's do
[1:37:23] something about it and I'm a firm
[1:37:24] believer in this every service we have
[1:37:26] is a revival service because I've been
[1:37:29] down in the dumps Church and I'll come
[1:37:31] to church I've studied and prayed I'm
[1:37:32] still battling fighting all these
[1:37:34] battles everything and I'll leave
[1:37:36] churches I leave Church revived amen and
[1:37:38] that revival will take me to Wednesday
[1:37:41] so I get another revival hallelujah
[1:37:46] every service is a revival that's why I
[1:37:49] act like it I come to pray before
[1:37:51] service every service because it's a
[1:37:53] revival to me if I thought it was time
[1:37:56] to cool off then I wouldn't pray as much
[1:37:58] anymore but we have to smear to keep
[1:38:01] ourselves what in constant revival
[1:38:06] because you're either moving towards
[1:38:09] your purpose towards God or away from
[1:38:11] God that's that's just the way I feel
[1:38:17] led to live my life now let capitis has
[1:38:20] things very close to Burt Britannica
[1:38:23] I don't trust Wikipedia okay I trust
[1:38:28] Britannica little more little because
[1:38:31] all the fake news it's hard to know who
[1:38:34] to trust
[1:38:35] other than God's Word the Bible and
[1:38:37] God's prophet it's hard to know who to
[1:38:38] trust
[1:38:39] but as the youth Lincoln disliked the
[1:38:41] hard labor associated with front to your
[1:38:43] life so see God already put this in him
[1:38:44] I really don't like you know just
[1:38:45] working with my hands you know see he
[1:38:48] was God ordained him to be a president
[1:38:51] that was his calling in life and so no
[1:38:54] wonder he just didn't I don't get
[1:38:55] excited about the chainsaw I don't of
[1:38:57] course it happened but I don't get
[1:38:58] excited about that acts like my dad or
[1:39:00] my brother why are you crazy
[1:39:03] you think you're good enough to go to
[1:39:04] school and you think you're smart enough
[1:39:06] to be just act like your dad just act
[1:39:08] like your brother now I've got a
[1:39:10] different purpose in my life oh you
[1:39:12] think you're better than us no God just
[1:39:14] put something in my heart I've just got
[1:39:17] a different purpose in life some of his
[1:39:21] name
[1:39:21] family members thought that time he was
[1:39:22] lazy Oh have you ever seen Abe he is so
[1:39:25] lazy he is the laziest worker out there
[1:39:30] and there's a children's book written by
[1:39:32] a historian and that's what they would
[1:39:34] do they would heat whatever he could do
[1:39:35] while reading he would do it whether
[1:39:37] it's chop wood clean wash the the wash
[1:39:42] the food break up the follow growl
[1:39:45] whatever he could do he would do it try
[1:39:48] to read at the same time that lazy boy
[1:39:53] why does he only want to read and write
[1:39:56] and get educated education z' of the
[1:39:58] devil
[1:40:00] see how people it's how people are just
[1:40:02] so unbalanced see how they're so
[1:40:04] unbalanced they just want an excuse not
[1:40:07] to go to school and work hard and the
[1:40:10] church said program said you find a
[1:40:15] Christian that's somebody that will work
[1:40:16] hard no matter whatever they're doing
[1:40:19] they'll be the best at whatever they do
[1:40:21] all she does is read and scribbled write
[1:40:24] and cipher and poetry he'll do anything
[1:40:27] to get away from manual labor and it
[1:40:29] wasn't even his fall so he he was just
[1:40:31] manifesting what was inside of him glory
[1:40:34] hallelujah stepmother said hmm you know
[1:40:39] we're like Phil's physical labor too
[1:40:41] much and think church if he did not
[1:40:44] follow the purpose of God in his life
[1:40:46] we're with african-americans be in our
[1:40:47] country today where would I because no
[1:40:50] my mom was Indian and Spanish and
[1:40:53] Mexican or whatever the combinations are
[1:40:55] I can show you the DNA but it doesn't
[1:40:58] really prove it hold I guess where would
[1:41:00] I be I might be in slavery today if he
[1:41:03] didn't follow his god-given purpose
[1:41:06] which was so different than everybody
[1:41:08] else in his family to the connection he
[1:41:15] was going to be
[1:41:15] Emancipator but the channel for God to
[1:41:19] do that wasn't like Moses to bring him
[1:41:21] out and go against the government the
[1:41:23] plan of God was different to place him
[1:41:26] through the government the church said
[1:41:29] Moses he come out with the staff and he
[1:41:32] just tore up the government but God
[1:41:34] didn't do it that way Abraham Lincoln
[1:41:36] side he did it by knowing him and
[1:41:38] sending him into the government when he
[1:41:47] grew up as a man he had less than a year
[1:41:49] of schooling and was one of the greatest
[1:41:52] presidents ever Amen hallelujah
[1:41:56] he was an avid reader and retained a
[1:41:59] lifelong interest in learning this is
[1:42:02] Wikipedia C he read all that he could
[1:42:05] read he reread the King James Bible
[1:42:07] glory Aesop's fables I'm not so big on
[1:42:11] those John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress
[1:42:13] my wife likes that book I never read it
[1:42:15] Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe I don't
[1:42:17] think my children liked that one very
[1:42:18] much at least that was kind of boring I
[1:42:19] think uh the life of Washington say you
[1:42:23] read about George Washington they had
[1:42:25] glory and the autobiography of Benjamin
[1:42:28] Franklin whoops oh I went to pilgrims
[1:42:32] progress sorry oh there's a link on that
[1:42:34] oh that's what it is okay sorry there's
[1:42:36] a hyperlink on that slide I didn't he
[1:42:38] realize that now the Britannica says his
[1:42:42] stepmother encouraged him in reading and
[1:42:44] yet the original source of his desire
[1:42:47] remains something of a mystery I just
[1:42:48] thought I'd highlight that amen brother
[1:42:50] Graham said the will of God for your
[1:42:53] life is a mystery and so the will of God
[1:42:56] still remains a mystery for to them they
[1:42:59] don't even know I was Abraham Lincoln
[1:43:01] well I was like this they don't even
[1:43:02] understand the mystery but we know the
[1:43:04] mysteries that he could free the the
[1:43:07] african-americans he can free all these
[1:43:09] men and women around our nation that's
[1:43:12] why he was born that was his purpose in
[1:43:15] life and he accomplished that purpose by
[1:43:17] honoring God amen
[1:43:21] see to them it's somewhat mysterious
[1:43:23] well I wonder why he likes learning and
[1:43:24] reading and writing so much what we know
[1:43:27] excusing they going
[1:43:29] he's gonna break down those natural
[1:43:30] walls and those natural prisons he was
[1:43:33] gonna break all those down that men and
[1:43:34] women could be free that's right he
[1:43:42] would walk miles just the borrow book he
[1:43:52] said the corn his own statement his
[1:43:53] early surroundings he had nothing around
[1:43:55] him to excite ambition for education he
[1:44:01] said still somehow I could read write
[1:44:02] and cipher in the rule of three but that
[1:44:04] was a ha I don't know what that means
[1:44:06] the rule of three apparently the young
[1:44:09] Lincoln did not read a large number of
[1:44:11] books but thoroughly absorbed a few that
[1:44:13] he could read I can't read a lot but
[1:44:15] what I got I'll just know I'll memorize
[1:44:17] that it's a good thing he only had the
[1:44:20] Bible
[1:44:21] praise God it's a good thing that one of
[1:44:23] the Bible in fact this was this says the
[1:44:25] Bible was the only book his family ever
[1:44:27] owned actually that's what this says
[1:44:29] Britannica
[1:44:30] Oh God knew how to do it God knew it
[1:44:34] somebody's gonna set Mane's of people
[1:44:36] free he's got to have one book oh it's
[1:44:39] the Bible hallelujah amen if I need
[1:44:43] somebody that's gonna set millions of
[1:44:45] people free let it be I'm gonna give
[1:44:46] them only one thing and that's the Word
[1:44:48] of God amen and that will set slaves
[1:44:51] free hallelujah that's the same thing
[1:44:54] that will set us free today is the Word
[1:44:55] of God amen when we meditate and give
[1:44:59] pre evidence to the Word of God we get
[1:45:02] the Pacitti today's the opposite we got
[1:45:04] to limit the books we read and focus on
[1:45:07] the Word of God now this is the fancy
[1:45:13] version of the Emancipation Proclamation
[1:45:15] have you ever seen the original it's a
[1:45:17] piece of yellow paper just hand written
[1:45:19] out front and back and they doctored up
[1:45:22] like this you know to be to be nailed
[1:45:23] all around the country I love that in
[1:45:25] that beautiful here's a man had no
[1:45:28] education and God ray
[1:45:33] is up this man out in that Kentucky log
[1:45:35] cabin raises them up and puts this
[1:45:40] ambition I've just got to learn for some
[1:45:42] reason I just got to read I've got to
[1:45:44] have the ability to read and write and
[1:45:46] be a lawyer and be smart and educated
[1:45:47] there's something inside of me pushing
[1:45:50] me to do this everybody else making fun
[1:45:52] of me call me lazy
[1:45:53] I've just got a burn to do have a
[1:45:55] purpose in life
[1:45:57] brother Branham said don't sit there and
[1:45:59] do nothing he said having ambition in
[1:46:01] your life know what God has called you
[1:46:03] to do now it's hard to see there it's
[1:46:07] really hard but he says in the in the
[1:46:10] this 22nd day of September of the year
[1:46:12] of our Lord our Lord 1862 a proclamation
[1:46:17] was issued by the President on States
[1:46:19] containing among other things the
[1:46:20] following and the first day of the next
[1:46:23] year January 1st 1863 all persons held
[1:46:26] as slaves within my state or designate a
[1:46:29] part of the state that people aware of
[1:46:31] shall be then in rebellion against the
[1:46:33] United States shall then be thought or
[1:46:35] henceforth and forever free amen on the
[1:46:40] January 1st
[1:46:41] everyone will be forever free who's been
[1:46:43] a slave before amen
[1:46:45] he said I'm proclaiming this why does
[1:46:48] why is he lazy why isn't he working he's
[1:46:50] got to learn how to read and write so
[1:46:52] that someday he can lead the country and
[1:46:54] set all the captives free a different
[1:47:00] purpose than most people Abraham Lincoln
[1:47:05] two months before the war ended he told
[1:47:08] a painter he said the central act of my
[1:47:11] administration the Emancipation
[1:47:14] Proclamation was the greatest event of
[1:47:16] the 19th century oh my goodness the
[1:47:22] greatest event was setting millions of
[1:47:24] people free how many agree with that I
[1:47:27] think I agree I often check the dates on
[1:47:30] what was the dates of John Wesley wasn't
[1:47:32] that 1700s that was the start of the
[1:47:35] church age I think I'm not mistaken
[1:47:38] oh yeah so the greatest name of the
[1:47:41] 1700s was God's messenger John Wesley
[1:47:44] coming on the scene or the 18th century
[1:47:46] rather the greatest event of the 19th
[1:47:48] century Abraham Lincoln setting the
[1:47:51] captives free amen and then the greatest
[1:47:58] event of the 20th century was God's
[1:48:01] prophet setting the bride free yes Amen
[1:48:07] did you remember the solemnity
[1:48:09] similarities they're born a hundred
[1:48:12] years apart 1809 1909 they're both born
[1:48:16] in a log cabin in Kentucky they never
[1:48:21] officially officially required
[1:48:23] membership in any church they're not
[1:48:25] tied down by denominational Creed's both
[1:48:29] their first and last names can say to
[1:48:31] contain seven late letters Lincoln's
[1:48:33] mill name doesn't have seven letters
[1:48:35] they're both elected to Congress well he
[1:48:38] was elected to Congress 1846 brother
[1:48:40] Branham got his commission he was
[1:48:42] elected to be the Prophet well we got
[1:48:44] the Commission on the angel in 1946 a
[1:48:46] hundred years apart and that's striking
[1:48:49] Church Abraham Lincoln died in 1865 at
[1:48:53] 56 years old brother Ram died in 1965 at
[1:48:56] 56 years old Lincoln was assassinated by
[1:49:02] a group of Jesuit followers Catholics
[1:49:04] the car that struck brother branham was
[1:49:05] killed killed him had three Catholic
[1:49:07] boys in it both of them have their faces
[1:49:11] carved in mountains Oh hallelujah don't
[1:49:15] you love that honey can say amen to that
[1:49:16] oh it's such a similarity let's stand
[1:49:19] our feet so church is it true I believe
[1:49:24] it with all my heart it is true the
[1:49:26] greatest event of the 20th century was
[1:49:29] God opening the seals by doing that
[1:49:35] all of the mysteries of God now the book
[1:49:37] can be open and now the Bible can be
[1:49:39] understood the way it was supposed to be
[1:49:43] understood Lincoln the greatest event of
[1:49:48] the 19th I believe William Branham the
[1:49:51] greatest event of the 20th century
[1:49:54] because now Saints can be freed in the
[1:49:56] Holy Spirit
[1:49:58] hallelujah after at the end of his
[1:50:03] ministry brother band says see that's
[1:50:05] what I'm in Arizona now there's many
[1:50:06] people sitting here stood right here in
[1:50:08] Phoenix and heard me tell you from this
[1:50:09] very platform thus saith the Lord how
[1:50:11] many members is it now
[1:50:12] something's fixing to happen now I went
[1:50:15] back and found this right before the
[1:50:17] sword came down in his hand brother
[1:50:19] Brandon told these people in Phoenix he
[1:50:21] said in the name of the Lord
[1:50:22] something's going to happen and I found
[1:50:26] it was January 14th 1963 listen to a
[1:50:29] programs real solemn he's real serious
[1:50:31] he's not real ah but he says he said I'm
[1:50:33] here in Phoenix tonight in the name of
[1:50:35] the Lord I would not try to explain
[1:50:39] what's happened many of you that's
[1:50:40] taking the tapes be sure to get that one
[1:50:41] what time is it sir that was just before
[1:50:44] I left home a vision sent me here yes I
[1:50:46] don't know I'm not a tape salesman I
[1:50:48] don't stress those things we get them
[1:50:50] and we got to take business around the
[1:50:51] world remember the Bible said prophets
[1:50:53] speak in the name of the Lord where did
[1:50:59] the CIO's do buh-bam tells us who know
[1:51:02] I'm sorry this is the same quote before
[1:51:03] the seals were opened right before he
[1:51:05] has the vision I'm sure right before he
[1:51:07] sees the seven angels right before he
[1:51:08] gets the Kings sword he tells him about
[1:51:10] sirs was the end time and he said after
[1:51:13] all of my life of seeing visions I never
[1:51:15] had anything like this before in my life
[1:51:17] and I don't know what it is I'm just
[1:51:18] here but he sent me here I don't know
[1:51:22] what it means I'm just here this is a
[1:51:23] literal prophecy Church this is a
[1:51:25] prophecy right here I'm here in the name
[1:51:28] of the Lord
[1:51:29] program tells him two years later he
[1:51:31] said to see I told you it was thus saith
[1:51:33] the Lord he said I don't know what's
[1:51:35] happening when he says he tells them a
[1:51:37] name of Lord God sent me here I don't
[1:51:39] know what it means
[1:51:40] I'm just here and then
[1:51:47] that sermon brother Bram talks about how
[1:51:48] he saw seven angels the sword came his
[1:51:51] hand said go home and open these seven
[1:51:53] seals that are given and here they are
[1:51:55] the true mystery of marriage and divorce
[1:51:56] and the serpent seen all these things
[1:51:58] that's been fuss about its thus saith
[1:52:00] the Lord what is it
[1:52:02] quickening power coming to the church to
[1:52:05] make her ready that the hour approaching
[1:52:08] quickening power oh god help us to
[1:52:09] receive it help us to believe it how
[1:52:11] many believe it I'm near sending warm
[1:52:14] waves out today I believe it with all my
[1:52:17] heart the quickening power of the word
[1:52:21] is here
[1:52:23] the greatest event brother Jose in the
[1:52:26] 20th century glory was God sending his
[1:52:33] prophet out west to get this sort the
[1:52:35] Kings sword and go home and break every
[1:52:38] seal and cut out every bit of doubt
[1:52:41] about the Word of God anymore amen oh
[1:52:43] there's no doubts about marriage and
[1:52:45] divorce there's no doubt about the seven
[1:52:49] seals of the church ages there's no
[1:52:51] doubts
[1:52:52] we've got thus saith the Lord but see
[1:52:55] it's all about no church this is where
[1:52:57] it gets to us for our worship it just
[1:52:58] depends attitude if we're just coming to
[1:53:01] church to come to church it's not it's
[1:53:03] not gonna have the quickening power
[1:53:06] we've got to constantly examine our
[1:53:09] motive and objective are we bringing the
[1:53:11] right kind of worship are we bringing
[1:53:13] something that's letter the holy spirit
[1:53:15] to church like I said it's okay we're
[1:53:19] just trying to sit there and absorb
[1:53:20] something from time to time but more
[1:53:22] often if we're really walking the spirit
[1:53:24] we should be able to bring something to
[1:53:26] the house of God how many want to do
[1:53:28] that by God's grace god bless you praise
[1:53:31] God let's bow our head that's here I was
[1:53:36] just so amazing to me that he had a
[1:53:40] purpose in life
[1:53:42] the RAM said don't lay around every
[1:53:46] Christian in every church ought to be
[1:53:49] that way find your purpose and go do it
[1:53:55] if your purpose is words of wisdom and
[1:53:57] you've seen God give you words of wisdom
[1:53:59] then please pray for that purpose
[1:54:02] get focus on that purpose if it's the
[1:54:05] same songs get focused on that God
[1:54:09] anointed me to bring a song this on
[1:54:11] doctrine or the Jose's brought me some
[1:54:14] good doctrines over the years if it's on
[1:54:19] tongues like our sister Naomi that may
[1:54:21] be her prayer request today
[1:54:23] interpretation if you've ever
[1:54:24] interpreted dream that might be your
[1:54:26] prayer today your focus right help me to
[1:54:31] find my purpose and go do it we don't
[1:54:37] want to lay around to have a purpose in
[1:54:42] life something that you're going to do
[1:54:46] Lincoln just said I'm just I just feel
[1:54:48] led to learn led to read these books

[1:56:11] rapturing faith movement Lord that we
[1:56:15] could come to the full the fullness of
