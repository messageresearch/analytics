song Services let's go to Second Kings chapter 13 by the grace of God second Kings chapter 13. I was thinking about this weekend you know what brother Diggs coming in I know he's a evangelist and uh Faith faith-building kind of preacher so I thought I'd preach some Faith tonight by God's grace just try to build your faith by the grace of the Lord you know we like I like to do series I like to teach right from the scripture as brother Ram said that's so important because it gives you a foundation praise God it puts you in position and you know where you're standing with God I'd like to by God's grace just a message on faith here tonight I'd like to just speak this I preach this quite a number of years ago nine years ago and I want to kind of update it uh I preached the arrow of God's Deliverance I'd like to preach that tonight by God's grace the era of God's Deliverance Second Kings 13. verse 14. so listen brother random preach this just a short message that he preached there in 1956 this beautiful message and brought the prayer line it was really really sweet message by God's grace Second Kings 13 verse 14. now I'll read by the grace of God why don't we read I'll read 13 I'm sorry I read 14 and 15. we'll all read 16 and then I'll read 17 it's a little longer there but so you'll just read 16 with me all right so verse 14 says now Elisha was Fallen sick of his sickness where have he died so in this in this case God didn't heal Elisha from that final sickness like with every other person normally right yet he was a prophet of God did twice as many miracles as Elijah and joash the king of Israel came down unto him and wept over his face and said o my father my father The Chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof and Elisha said unto him take bow and arrows and he took unto him bow and arrows let's read let's read verse 16. ready one two three and he said to the king of Israel put thine hand upon the bow and he put his hand upon it and Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands now I'll read 17 it's a little bit longer there but and he said open the window Eastward and he opened it then Elisha said shoot and he shot and he said the arrow of the Lord's Deliverance and the arrow of deliverance from Syria for Thou shalt Smite the syrians in afec till thou have consumed them Hallelujah how many enjoy the word of God tonight may God has blessing the Ring of his word maybe seated praise God so I'll take this thought and preach this back on September of ninth sorry 2014 not 19. 2014. so it's almost been almost been 10 years by God's grace I don't know if anybody was there when I preached it that's here maybe Jose just come in there I'm pretty sure my wife was there you know sometimes I mess with the sick kids so I want to kind of update this I had a few thoughts about that and you know with uh like I said brother Diggs coming in I wanted to kind of reach a message that would just raise your faith by the grace of God it's been raised in my faith um and then you know with sister Naomi traveling and you know just all the pressures that come with travel and I thought it'd be another good reason to preach some Faith by God's grace so we're thankful for God's Amazing Grace this week by God's grace or Saturday I put out that video about the 9th and 10th lie out of Jeffersonville then today I put out the first video about how Jim Jones did not believe brother Ram's message so kind of ended last Wednesday's sermon with that thought and so getting those things out there and there's been a few people that have been thankful you know they had questions about these things and I just thank God that the holy spirit is here to give us answers and uh you know what's really shocking to see which I'm sure you're familiar with most people won't even research to see if what a person's saying is true in other words there's not many fact Checkers out there right but thank God we can check the facts praise God and all the facts go back to the word of God so if you're interested in those those are out there by the grace of God Hallelujah and so let's look at this you know uh we'll background this here a little bit by the grace of the Lord and uh uh I'm not sure how long this will be you know we'll kind of see how it goes so we find in this uh scripture here we're looking at the time of the Prophet Elisha of course we know he followed Elijah and Elisha had a double portion of the Holy Spirit on him by the grace of God and that because that's what he asked for I think it's I think it's wonderful church that you know if a man or woman is truly dedicated to God God will give them the desire of their heart that's all Elisha wanted he just wanted a double portion of what he had and remember church he was willing to sell out ever he was willing to to kill his oxen he was willing to totally in other words totally cut off his own life in order to get that blessing he cut off everything from his past life sold out everything in order to get the desire of his heart praise God now Church there could be no greater desire of anyone's heart than to see your loved one saved in heaven praise God is that right we know that's what a Hattie Wright asked for she could add a million dollars she could have had lots of she could have the health of her family or her parents or her sister Edith who's in a wheelchair but she asked for salvation praise God and God granted to her so we see the most valuable thing any of us could desire tonight would be eternal life because you can have all miracles will be good but the Bible says in First Corinthians 13 you can have all that and if you don't have love it doesn't profit you anything you can cast out Devils you can move mountains you can do all these things but without the love of God it doesn't profit us anything so the thing we should do constantly is look at ourselves and make sure we got the love of God float out of our lives right and that's ministering to others as treating others as we treat ourselves right that's important that's the that's the very heart of Christianity praise God treating others the way you want to be treated Hallelujah but this is what Elisha asked for he asked for a double portion and God gave it to him brother said that the type of Christ and the church now it's not a perfect type like we looked at a few weeks ago right Sunday school girls because does the church have twice as much Holy Ghost as Jesus no so see how the type doesn't work that it's an incomplete type the type that does work is that the bride or the body of Christ does more Works than Jesus right because the bride has more time to do it and it's Jesus in The Bride for two thousand years rather than three and a half praise God but you got to watch your types there right you got to keep your Bible straight Hallelujah I'm supposed to be preaching Faith tonight okay so let me let me preach Faith here I'm trying to get down to these rightly divided I better preach Faith so forgive me anyways joash King joash here now there's a couple of couple ways to say his name uh there's a couple different ways in the scripture because there's Kings and there's Chronicles that write about some of the same events but just to give you an idea it seems here uh that this King was either the fourth or fifth generation after Ahab and uh King joash here was he was on the side of the northern part of Israel not Judah and how many remember how many good kings were on the Northern side anybody remember Lydia got it zero there is no good Kings on the Northern side of Israel right you started with jeroboam right and you go all the way down pretty soon you get Eli zimmery Omri and then Ahab brother Ram said no one seldom the Bible says no one selled out the Lord like Ahab did because of his wife Jezebel right a type of the Jezebel spirit that spirit's on the Roman Catholic Church right now either four because there's some of these names are similar uh the king here in the Days of Elijah was either four or five Kings after Ahab so in other words Church it wasn't getting any better it was getting worse right and then if you count from from this King there's either there's either eight or eight or seven more Kings left before they're all done with in Northern Israel until they're carried off until they fall to Samaria in 722 BC so brother M calls him a lukewarm king or a backslitting king if you listen to that sermon from 1956. he calls him a backslitting king may God help our lives so that no one ever calls us backslidden Hallelujah may we be so sincere before God that we're not called backslidden we won't accept a backseat in life and the church said because it's up to you and I right we get whatever we ask for right we pray to God the Bible said you have not because you asked not so if we don't want to be back soon let's pray Lord let my fire burn brighter amen stir me up on a Wednesday night or a Sunday night or a Sunday morning stir me up Lord don't let me become backstage and praise God you promised you give me the desire of my heart amen is that right so we got to ask with faith believing praise God we've got to ask confessing our faith Hallelujah confessing the word of God also confessing our sins and so we see you know that uh actually you know the scripture records in Second Kings that King joash here or is also name is jehosh is also another way to say his name he was actually uh the Bible said that he tolerated the worship of the golden calves okay so that was the bad thing against him the scripture records he did evil in the sight of the Lord so we find he was backslidden he's a lot like his great great great great predecessor King Ahab and he allowed idol worship a church we've got to be very careful in our lives not to let Idols into our lives whether it's money or whether it's popularity or whether it's a a spouse or a husband right or any anything at all we got to be very careful not to let Idols in Satan's very sly right he's no dummy they call him dumb Devil he's no dumb devil said he's smarter and brother Matt says time goes on he gets more sly because he learns more I got quotes on that I need to preach a sermon on that actually I want to make a video on that the dumb devil video where no one should call him that you don't see you don't even see Jesus doing that you don't see Michael the Archangel doing that he just says the Lord rebuke you Satan right we've got to be very careful not to let certain things become idols right you gotta be very careful because we can all have idols food becomes Idol for a lot of people in America right food so Comfort becomes an idol you'll do anything just to be more comfortable right that becomes an idol and so let's not think well well brother jesser you know Sister so-and-so none of us could ever have Idols it's actually quite the opposite Paul I'm sorry John the Revelator and Paul warn us not to have Idols to flee from idols right in fact the Corinthians you know what their Idols were some of them were preachers one said I'm of I'm a cephas I'm a Peter man I'm of Apollos I'm Apollos man now today it might be I'm a Donnie Reagan man I'm a Ron Spencer man now nobody says I'm a Jesse Smith man so I don't I don't need to put my name in there but people have all kinds if they're not careful they'll make a preacher an idol see if Satan can't get you to go out and and you know make something sinful and Idol cigarette or alcohol or marijuana then he'll try to get you to make a preacher an idol right gotta be very careful in other words whatever that preacher says that's gospel well be careful we want to respect God's service but we also don't want to worship God's servants right so let's not think well I could never be like this King let's try to gain something from this text I mean brother man preach it to the people the people received it and I believe you and I can receive something from it as well praise God now let's go to the scripture I don't know how long I'm going to be I might preach half an hour we'll see we'll see if that's even possible verse 14. I got a little runny nose myself here but Overcoming By God's grace verse 14. now Elisha was falling sick of his sickness whereof he died see God doesn't always heal right some people say God always heals God always heals God always wants to heal this case he didn't when he died God didn't want to heal Elijah actually he wouldn't take him home or you could say he wanted to heal him in a different way take him out of the the this pest house and put him into a theophany body that's a great healing praise God and joash the king of Israel came down unto him and wept over his face and said oh my father o my father the chair to Israel and the horsemen thereof now stop a moment what would it take for you to cry over somebody being sick who would it have to be so you'd cry over them that's when you know you're really that you you really love that person in other words when we've had prayer requests up here when was the last time somebody cried over the prayer request up here no I'm getting kind of serious I'm trying to build your faith too at the same time he comes down here this is a back sitting King he's allowing idolatry which are if you read earlier in the chapter the enemies syrians are coming against him so he's a man under pressure he's a man that feels threatened he's a vaccinating guy in other words they know that the Judah kings are good Kings they serve God but he knows we allow idols but now the pressure's on and he's starting to get real desperate for God sound familiar anybody sometimes we're not as diligent as we should be sometimes we let things come up in our lives that kind of distract us away from the service of the Lord like we should be I mean can we all say Amen to that I can say Amen to that and what is it and God in his Mercy allows us to get a trial like look like like I'll be honest even this you know recent news about uh is the are they going to be able to the the debt ceiling is that going to be able to raise the debt ceiling and I saw a few videos there people are warning oh this is the time of the crash now everything's going to crash now well that that shakes me a little bit I got to pray through that praise God I mean all these things I mean all of us are not immune to those things right and so God in his Mercy uh you know shows there's at least some reverence in this King even though he's fourth or fifth from Ahab he's got some reverence for God right and he hears the prophet of God is dying and like I said who was the last person you cried over when they were dying hopefully hopefully somebody you know you loved but see not everybody we're close to we're not we don't have feelings for everybody but I just want you to see what kind of respect would you have to have for a man or woman dying and you go there and cry over them like I just went to Mike McCloskey's I just wept and cried like a baby just seeing him in pain and he wasn't even dying that shows how much I love him praise God but hear the king he wepts over his face and he said oh my father my father The Chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof this sound familiar this was spoken right when Elijah was going up to heaven this is so joash is King Josh is repeating what Elijah said or what I'm sorry what Elisha said about Elijah I remember when Perry green died and uh brother Stephen Shelley put that on you Facebook right you remember that brother Jose Peregrine was dying and he put that script he said put those words up there oh my father my father the chair to Israel and the horsemen thereof that's a very respectful thing to say what this is saying this is actually a compliment to the prophet of God this is saying oh my father you're our leader and your presence with us is greater than every Chariot and every military might in other words the power of God that's with you is more important than any natural weapon that we have amen the horses of Israel the chairs thereof that's your that's your military power but this prayer is oh God has taken this man off the scene he's a mighty man of God and he cries out to God he's weeping oh God don't take your Prophet yet God took our prophet in 1965. before any of us were even around right and he is so sincere he weeps over his face the Bible said he weeps over his face I don't know if you take that litter or not but he cries out to God he said this he said in other words I thank you God for this man he's been more important to us than all our weapons and all of our natural military force and brother man in this sermon says he says Church don't you know that the Holy Ghost Field church is more powerful than all the atomic bombs America can produce praise God [Applause] a Praying Church a church that loves the Holy Ghost a church that loves a worship and give God praise and pray pray people or pray with people until they get the Holy Ghost like we just saw in Napoleon praise God a church that does that is most important at keeping this nation protected praise God Hallelujah let's not forget you're highly favored here tonight Church let's not forget that I was testified again to my Barbers tonight all these wonderful testimonies God has done he was telling me a good testimony he had to God provided uh during covet you know The Barbers lost their job right and he's like where am I going to get money and he said one of the last guys that came in or no one of the guys that come in he said this guy was an old man and he he snotted all the time and he couldn't hear so look I was like he was yelling all the time and he was the hardest customer to have he said but when covert hit he has the barber has three kids he said he didn't have any job you know how they shut down for all these I mean everyone was essential workers except McDonald's and Burger King everybody else was essential worker other than those guys yet they let them work but The Barbers were essential although the government said no but anyways this this hard customer uh he calls him up a few weeks after that and said hey do you need any money he's like no he said he said that's fine he said let me give you 500 dollars and so this old man who was the hardest customer uh ever to to deal with gave him 500 the man died two days later so you can ask Josh about that next week and he said he called the wife up and give it back and she's like no he won we talked about it we and we wanted to give it to you as a blessing to you and just a beautiful example of God providing so I got to share my testimonies too that's it oh it's testimony time for he's got it in the barbershop now if only you turn off that rock and roll music we'll be all right but I think it's just a beautiful testimony Church of just remembering how faithful God is to us aren't you glad God's faithful God think about all the time in your life how God has provided for you shows up when you didn't expect it praise God Amen shows up when you when you need it the most praise God that's our God Amen that's what he does that's who he is amen hallelujah he just shows up and he proves himself faithful he proves himself he's worthy to be trusted praise God amen Hallelujah like I was telling this Austin this testimony there's this there's this this church I've been helping overseas for a few years in Uganda I was telling Austin this testimony this woman was asking for money you know uh for for pesticides because our church by God's grace has helped them out uh some of the people are starving so we've we've sent love offerings over there they sent me the pictures and pastors sent me pictures uh to plant just wheat it's because they don't have wheat and the sister said can you send this money for pesticides I'm like sister I don't got it I said I can't have you begging me all the time I said I said but I said you pray and if the Lord sends me money I'll send you that money I said by the end of the day well I got home and I got a check and there was a check in the mail for a thousand dollars so I said okay I'll give you that little I said God heard your prayer sister Hallelujah I didn't send all a thousand but she asked for a certain amount and that's going to feed how many people is that going to feed by God's grace in other words call upon the Lord hallelujah and if it's God's will he'll hear an answer praise God I thought that was a beautiful testimony because I like I didn't even I really didn't expect it I just said you pray sister you know we've worked with her over the years her and these other Saints there in the church there and they constantly have starving people constantly have starving people there's a drought right but I just thought it's a good testimony call on the Lord hallelujah he's faithful praise God his ears are open to his children's cries amen thank God Amen but look at this man look at the king so a bachelor in person knows how to Humble himself and respect the prophet of God and so now we can apply this to ourselves even if we're struggling serving God and we all do yeah don't say you don't don't lie in church we all struggle so now we see a pattern right we see a pattern God's not a respecter of persons so even if somebody that's not where they should be if they'll just humble themselves and res show some respect to God in God's family oh amen praise God hallelujah if you just humble if we just humble ourselves show respect to the prophet of God brother random right of course but he's gone right so we show respect so what do we do brother show respect to the Holy Spirit he says amen in other words pray to Jesus worship Jesus humble yourself talk to Jesus Hallelujah or listen to a tape I mean I told you that one testimonial brother Elijah Gibbs from Connecticut his whole life when we saw his brother last year in Albion I saw his brother at the marriage banquet and he confirmed it his brother Elijah Gibbs was born with some defect in his leg he always walked with a limp but he was a preacher while listening to brother Branham he'd prayed for years God healed my leg the doctors couldn't do it he's listening to brother Branham in a chair brother Adam says something about you know healing a person with that same thing the Holy Spirit pushes him off his chair he falls down now imagine that doesn't doesn't very doesn't sound like the softest Angel's hands does that one sound like himself like Elijah Elijah got the angel with the softest hands let me put you to sleep Elijah he got pushed over in the chair and laying on the floor when he stood up he said his leg was completely made well his foot or whatever it was he said brother Jesse this message is right I said thank you I know too amen I haven't seen it like that but I know it's right Hallelujah and he's a wonderful brother he's just really good with the scripture he likes to rightly divide the word and we kind of lovingly debate back and forth he's a real fine brother I'll tell you one of the finest he started many churches over there too I shouldn't say many but a number of churches there in Connecticut and so that's the idea show respect to the word of God Hallelujah home in other words humble yourself the king could have stayed in church he could have stayed in his comfortable Palace he's going to stay there but he comes and sees a dying prophet and he gives such a compliment my father my father the Chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof oh God in other words God please don't take your Prophet off the scene now for us it can be oh God send your spirit once more praise God oh God don't forget me in this hour trouble Lord we need you to move I need you now I need God to show up I need the anointing of God hallelujah show God some respect praise God that's right he basically said a lie Elisha was more valuable than all the military efforts right and all the power of the strength of Israel that's a good way to respect God LeBron says respect his word hallelujah respect the word of God and his servants look at verse 15. and Elisha said to them take bow and arrows and he took unto him bows and heirs now here here's a good lesson let's always obey the word of God he could have said no Prophet I'm not going to do that I'm not going to do what the prophet said I'm not going to do what the Bible said brother random said you want to grow in love with God okay what are the two things he said you can say it out loud read your Bible and now how many are doing that as consistently as possible because we're not legalists here but how many believe the prophet now I've seen that it's a reality as I've read my Bible and pray I love Jesus more how do you know because I keep serving him I don't walk away from him I don't walk away from his people hallelujah thank God how simple is that do what the prophet said Hallelujah obey the word of God follow the more in love with Jesus and you can't love Jesus without loving his people praise God brother I said that's the way you know people love Jesus because they love God's people praise God ah thank God bye that's beautiful thank God he said take the bow and arrows and he took unto him bow and arrows now you know the white horse rider and you know the scriptures too the Bible says that Satan strings his bow and shoots out lies with arrows and we have the shield of faith right to extinguish every fiery Dart I think I finished with that last week didn't I on Wednesday night or the night Wednesday before so so so arrows are likened unto attacks or lies but now that's for the devil but now God is going on the offensive here God's saying your word is like an arrow but really it's God's word in your mouth Hallelujah because you and I my words won't do nothing we've all tried it right speak Prosperity speak Prosperity name it and claim it that's it's not true it's got to be God's thought behind it praise God it's name What God Says and claim what God Said claim Hallelujah name and claim what God Said to name and claim right so see we're getting some good lessons here from this backslidden man who in just like Ahab mind just like Abram found a moment of sincerity he's weeping he's crying I need a miracle the walls they say the walls are closing in I got this nation over here Syria there's different ones uh they they name them by name later on we'll get to that in a moment but I've got pressure here things are starting to close them I'm feeling trapped uh I better start honoring God now yeah it's time to honor God now it's been time to honor God it's always time to honor God hallelujah but God works with us despite our weaknesses praise God amen verse 16. now look at this here and he said to the king of Israel put thine hand upon the bow and he put his hand upon it and Elijah put his hands upon the king's hands now this should sound real familiar to some Sunday school girls shouldn't it so the king puts his hands on the bow and then Elisha puts his hands on the bow Hallelujah remember a few uh Sundays ago when we did the crossing of the arms Hallelujah and what Jacob say Jacob said oh Joseph said Daddy you you know you you blessed the wrong one you cross your hands and Jacob said I didn't do it son God did it God crossed my hands God to control the hands but now in this case the king puts his hand on the bow but now the prophet puts his own hand on top that represents God's anointing is going to be with the king's hands strength in the king's hand church and you and I have no strength unless God puts his strength in our hands praise God Hallelujah just like all those you know just like shamgar use what's in your hand just like Samson this Jawbone is worthless unless God gets in it praise God can I say like this our lives and our testimonies are worthless unless God gets into it Hallelujah come on somebody amen our days are our routines our Earthly habits I mean it's all useless unless God steps in and God puts his hand on your hand amen if God puts his thought in your thought if God puts his word in your mouth Hallelujah now you're going to get somewhere praise God Hallelujah thank the Lord so you see the same thing here by the grace of the Lord same idea God takes control of the hand and then God puts his hand on your hand Hallelujah how many ever felt the grace of God when you're feeling distraught you're feeling sad you're feeling fearful and then you can feel like God's spirit comes upon you now you uh you honestly feel better now oh yeah I love when that happens that's like when Simon came that one time and nine things nine things were discerned in my life you know just times like that you come to church you don't feel very good but by the end you feel a lot better why because God put his hand on your hand oh man I think that God put his Spirit on your human Spirit praise God and it changes everything and now a backsitting king gets to use a weapon of offense he's cornered the walls are closing in but the holy spirit says pick up the bow because I'm going to put my strength in your hand for it oh Hallelujah church when we have trials and we have difficult times God will sometimes say pick up the word of God pick up your phone and play that sermon pick up that phone and play that Bible app come on somebody like Haven the other night right Heyman look uh picks up that phone and opens a Bible app and the verse of the day is exactly what she needed to hear then she shared it with our friends amen I love that praise God when you go to God God has exactly what we need praise God amen in other words God put your strength in my hand praise God put your word in my mouth as I'm preaching tonight God speak through me praise God I can't help anybody I don't want people to leave her discouraged and have all these mind battles I want everyone to be victorious so God put your word in my mouth praise God Hallelujah don't let me be a failure don't let me be uh let me don't let me Miss Don't Let Me Be In the Flesh don't let me be carnal let me be led by the Holy Spirit praise God hallelujah praise God where people say it was good to be in the house of the Lord I did have some battles and brother Jesse saying about the battles amen I did need Victory and we sang about having Victory praise God amen now I closed my Bible so I lost my spot there so all right yeah I had to bookmark praise God now we see that verse 16. so now the prophet puts his hands on the king's hands and now it's different now he remember the prophet represented the power of God that's why I said oh the Chariots of Israel The Horseman thereof that's our church what's the most important thing a nation has is real Holy Ghost Field believers now we're not going to brag and get into the bride Pride debate but it is there is some truth to the fact that this nation is protected because there's holy ghost-filled Saints in this nation right but don't forget Holy Ghost Field Saints still are Martyrs sometimes they still got to suffer but Jesus said whatever you do to the leaves of these my brethren you've done it unto me the least now church let me be the least okay can I be the least Hallelujah I mean somebody's the least at least I want to be in the the kingdom of God praise God whatever we do for one another it's as if we're doing it for Jesus let's be good to each other let's be kind to each other let's say nice things praise God let's do all we can do because when we've done it unto one another it's like doing it to Jesus and then He blesses us and a great reward awaits us hallelujah like we're just saying about greatly be rewarded for your service here because the Bible said do it especially to the household of faith especially oh I love that praise God now here's where I want to get to this verse 17 is kind of where we're getting to the the main part of the story right because now we know he's back we know his situation he's backslidden the walls are closing he's under pressure and he finally shows some respect to God Hallelujah think about that what would it look like for you and I to Humble ourselves and show great respect for God hallelujah what does that look like for him it was crying for him it was recognizing wow the spirit of God is more powerful than guns swords tanks unit chariots let's do the equivalent to today he's crying because wow this is our most important servant of the Lord this is this is uh the king being humble verse 17. now here we get the directions here and he said open the window Eastward and he opened it then Elisha said shoot and he shot now brother random uses a few types in here the open window is opening he says to the Eastward and we know Jesus comes from the East brother Ram says also the Bible says that I have to look up that scripture but the Bible says comes out of the East so this represents opening your sight right opening your vision to the coming of the Lord right it's like opening yourself to receive the Lord to the coming of the Lord in other words it's like looking to Jesus praise God so the prophet says look to Jesus look to Jesus and let the word of God go Hallelujah speak the word of God Moses Hallelujah speak the word of God and go forward praise God if you know the word of God you can speak the word of God hallelujah if you don't know you got to wait till you have the word of God so he says shoot and he shoots and he said the arrow of the Lord's Deliverance so this was going to be a symbolic thing he shoots one arrow and this represents God's Deliverance it's just like that stone that went out of David's sling that we sing about all those motions it's just like the Slate the stone the stone represents the power of God going out to meet the enemy praise God ah represents the power of God in other words faith in God's word is going forth and God's word is going to accomplish amen this Arrow will not return void amen this Stone from David will not return void it's going to accomplish what God has determined for it oh Hallelujah the stone this Arrow it's the Lord's deliverance and what word do we get from Deliverance salvation Arrow salvation the walls are closing in the enemy's coming in like a flood but I go to the prophet I honor God's word I show respect to God's word and God gives me a word and God is going to bring Salvation to me praise God oh it's a beautiful story teaches us how to Humble ourselves and show respect to God and ask God for victory now we're going to get into the Freemore agency part here pretty soon so everybody get ready now get ready Hallelujah because Church in these moments it's very difficult sometimes to know you're in that moment and you'll see what I'm saying here in a moment you'll see because if you remember the story the king does good but he doesn't do good enough I don't want to start any mind battles with anybody I never want to do but how many want to go all the way with the Lord I think some of the biggest fears is for Christians is that we were not doing enough right we talked about that before I don't want anyone to feel that way but this is a lesson where we can see some plain truths here if we need Deliverance we've got a call on God we've got to show respect to God okay but then we get some great insights here from the word of God and church that's the that's the the thing we got to look for uh well the man calls it the spur of the moment in that moment when you're in the trial in that moment when it's difficult you got to recognize when God's presence comes and you've got to believe for every promise of God for your situation you'll see what I'm saying here in just a moment oh I hope I'm not speaking in dark sayings and Mysteries or something like that I'm just trying not to get to it before I get to it you know I'm sure trying to slow down a little bit here the heir of the Lord's Deliverance he says this is the arrow this represents God's salvation what a blessing amen what a blessing he humbles himself he goes to the prophet and the prophet said I'm going to give you a sign that God's going to deliver you shoot this arrow and this is going to be the sign God is going to deliver you oh praise God Amen Hallelujah God's going to give you an arrow of Deliverance a sign that you're guaranteed to get the victory oh I'm gonna watch on Sunday when brother Dixon is here praise God I'll be looking for some arrows Hallelujah some promises of God Amen that was striking you can look for him tonight too praise God Amen some promises of God that speak to your heart and you receive them and then you speak God's word and you believe it praise God in other words what are you talking about revelation the Simplicity of God I need a revelation I'm in a difficult trial I'm I'm cornered I need a way of Escape I need salvation God give me a revelation God give me the word Lord Give Me A Sign that you're going to save me praise God oh amen thank God I remember last time brother Dukes came it's like he preached the next uh sermon on the Joshua series I've never had that before it's like you just picked up where I left off how'd you know that oh you're our dad our dad told you to preach that that's right dad told you to preach out Hallelujah that's a real encouragement he says the air Lord delivers at verse 17 and the Arab deliverance from Syria for Thou shalt Smite the syrians in afec till thou have consumed them so the arrow going out and Landing it was smiting the ground right and that represents God's word is going to God is going to go fight for you it's going to Smite the enemy it's gonna hit the target amen don't you love him God hits the target praise God you need God to bring the healing you need this amount of money or you need that person saved or whatever and God hits the target praise God hallelujah thank God that's a blessing we run to God in our in our human Frailty we run to God like oh God I need you you know finally it's about time we run to God in our humility we show respect to God we get sincere and God gives us a blessing amen I'll say like this it's undeserved right but he still blesses us because he loves us praise God amen hallelujah says this represents that you're going to Smite the enemy what a blessing because the enemy was surrounding him and he was hearing rumors you're going to die by the syrians the syrian's going to destroy you they're way too they're way too powerful but now this prophet of God gave me a word from the Lord the church that's what we need we need a word from the Bible praise God we need a word from the Holy Spirit there's about 30 minutes Hallelujah I'm almost done we'll see look at this he says now the the special last line look till thou have consumed them now God says through the prophet you will consume them Oh Glory they will not consume you they won't take your life you're going to defeat the enemy praise God you have to worry about wasting away you don't have to worry about losing oh I like a god who helps me to win praise God I hate to lose I would cry if I lost a baseball game when I was little I cry if I lost a football game when I got older but with God we're not losers we're winners praise God I'm glad I'm on The Winning Side amen thank God Hallelujah but notice until so the word of God says this represents you're saved till you consume them praise God think about that just like the Red Sea no more slaves no more slave masters no more drugs no more alcohol no more cussing no more depression no more lesson no more fear no more pride and the church said no more it's all going to be consumed God is bringing me the victory why because I show respect to his word because he loves me I'm actually a part of God's family praise God I am Israel and we're spiritual Israel Hallelujah in one way don't take that too far got a lot of people saying they're they're actually Israel like they're the 144 000 that's what the Jehovah's Witnesses dude so let's we're not going that far we're going the we're the we're the ones the Bible said that we serve god with the spirit with a sincere heart our hearts are circumcised right that's that's the real script the real Jew but we're not 144 000. now verse 18. and he said take the arrows and he took them now here's where we're getting real to the important part here under the king of Israel Smite upon the ground now I'm not sure how this happened here I can't really explain this I looked up in the concordance but I couldn't quite explain it but notice he says so he shot one Arrow it's smote the ground and he said take the arrows and smite them on the ground he smote them Thrice and say now one one writer said he he went out and got the other arrow that he shot and then he come back and smited him into the ground another one didn't mention it either way so I'm not sure how this looked out but the point is church this boy the point isn't that's not the point the point is that he took the arrows and he smote the ground three times now some people say he might have shot three arrows other people said he might have shot one arrow and then took two arrows and just smote him in the ground I'm not sure how it worked out but the prophet said Smite him upon the ground now the prophet just showed him this Arrow represents smiting the enemy and then he says now you're going to totally consume them he says you smite him now Smite these on the ground and the King got all anointed by the Holy Spirit and maybe he threw it down like that or maybe he shot number two and he shot number three he thought praise God I've got Deliverance hallelujah praise God the prophet told me to do this I'm doing this in the name of the Lord I'm trusting by faith I'm sending my faith out there praise God I'm asking the Holy Spirit deliver me save me in other words God said this three prayers in a row can I say like that three scriptures spoken three uh three prayers spoken I'm trusting to God we'll hear these prayers and he said praise God 's going to deliver me that's a pretty good testimony pretty good testimony verse 19. and the man of God was blessed no but now we're getting into this free more agency thing here and the man of God was Wrath with him and said thou shouldest have smitten five or six times then hast thou Smit in Syria till thou Hast consumed it whereas now Thou shalt Smite Syria but Thrice so here we have to read between the lines what God wanted was for King joash to take a number of arrows and just keep shooting till all the arrows he had just keep going you're under that anointing just keep speaking the word of God right just keep speaking the word of God just keep speaking it right in other words God wanted to see more faith on his part God wanted to see him take more arrows and shoot him out and Trust for more deliverances he only did three though right and the prophet said you sit in five or six now the prophet never told him how many to shoot but the prophet gets mad because he only did three isn't that something three is a pretty good number in the Bible how many number three is a pretty good number father son Holy Ghost faith hope charity right Peter James John you got a lot of good threes in the Bible but in this case three wouldn't uh he could have done more right what is what a striking thing he said there's only three he said you should have done five or six why not four four is the number of Deliverance why not four but he says you should have did five or six and the prophet's mad you should have had more faith in God all right now don't be discouraged now go down to verse 25. look at verse 25. and joash the son of Joe has took again out of the hand of Ben Hader the son of hazyah of the Cities which he had taken out of the hand of Joe has his father by war three times the Jewish beat him and recovered the cities of Israel now this ought to be encouraging right in other words however much Faith you have in God that's how much God will do for you right can I say like this the more you draw an eye to God the more God will draw an eye to you oh Hallelujah and the church said right because God said you could have came five or you could have did five or six times smiting these arrows represent deliverance and so the king said I can believe for three deliverances now brother man dramatizes it because he's a make-believer and brother Adam says see I can go to church I can join denomination and I can pay tithes and offerings that's a brother answer those are the three arrows in other words they will only only go so far with their religion but Brothers says believe for more than that brother sister believe for Divine Healing amen believe for the arrow of the baptism of the Holy Ghost believe for the arrow that all things are possible to them that believe praise God oh Hallelujah now what did he move what did he lose out on total victory he got three victories but he missed out on total victory because a lack of faith a lack of really getting into it now think about this church let's say he struck it like this he did he shot at one and then he did two three okay let's say like that or maybe it was one Smite two Smite three Smite Smite Smite smite God wanted to do some more instead of God wanted him to do Church said Hallelujah God wanted to do let it go let it go let it go let it go God want him to keep going Hallelujah there's sometimes church when the Holy Ghost is moving you by your brother just clap a few times then other times you remember this when the Holy Ghost starts moving brother Jasper's not like oh hallelujah praise God and the church said and God starts moving right one little clap thank you Lord for that sermon we're so self-styled and uh starchy thank you Lord I'll give you three three smites it's a great sermon Lord and God's like no praise me give me more praise God Amen how much you want from God Amen how much you need you're in trouble quiet to God don't just do three prayers Don't Say the Name of Jesus three times say it five times amen Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus come over sing Jesus amen that's what it's saying he's saying cry to God more put more into it praise God be more desperate however much you pour into it that's how much you'll get out Hallelujah Hallelujah in the moment of trial in the moment of tests you got to trust God trust his word speak his word praise God and you'll get back whatever you put in and it's a free moral agency thing he didn't say how many times to do it he just said you you smite it in other words now we can go back to the sermon from a few weeks ago when the Amish were here you speak to the Rock what are you going to say The Rock you can get mad at the Rock right I'm gonna ignore the rock you're gonna try to uh try to barter with The Rock try to make it's okay to make a vow with God it's okay but we got to speak to him in love we got to praise him we gotta so thank we gotta thank him for all he's done we got to Magnify Him we got when every time the Holy Ghost well the Bible said they either magnified God or they praise God or some type of worship when we when we want something from God we gotta Praise Him First Hallelujah back to this Pro that's what this King did he come and showed respect he cried he said you're so valuable you're such a wonderful man of God you're more important than all of our natural uh blessings your spiritual connection to God is the most important thing we have and so God said Smite as much as you want praise God oh my God praise God it's just like brothers Hattie right ask whatever you want Hallelujah in other words Smite it not just once not just twice but dude despite as much as you want in other words give God your greatest desire ask God for desire your heart and he'll Grant your desire of your heart praise God the king could only believe in getting three cities back well guess what church he got him back but he could have got more oh it's a beautiful story in the Beautiful Hallelujah so the the prophets upset because they could have got more Victory if the king would have had more faith in God everybody see that by God's grace Hallelujah let me read this quote from mother Brown brother Brown says now no matter how mysterious it seems God always keeps his word no matter how unreasonable it may seem to people God keeps his word brother I said sometimes it seems like it's ridiculous the way that God would go around to keep his promise but God always keeps his promise Church alls he did all he did was either Smite he shoot it and smite in the ground all he did was shoot three arrows all he did was just maybe Smite two arrows in the ground with his hand and that led to three cities three entire cities being gained back to the people of God everyone said I don't care how ridiculous it looks like God's Gonna back up his promise if God ever promised you something he's going to give it to you I don't care how ridiculous I don't care how long you got to wait if God gives a word it's going to come to pass praise God is that right don't don't care how ridiculous it seems trust God trust God's word hallelujah and I'm not talking I mean yeah I'm talking about something you can read in the Bible yes but I'm talking about even personal Revelations that maybe not are found in the Bible but if God gives you revelation God is going to keep that word praise God it might look ridiculous how it happened but God's going to keep his word that's what brother Adam says that's what we can learn from this story how many learning tonight hopefully a little bit by God's grace I know it's not all brand new brother random says this the same tonight is happening for the Christian church so this story the same things happened for the church tonight did you know that good reminder huh we have struck the arrow of God's Deliverance he said it was God sent the arrow Deliverance to us the air of Deliverance is the holy spirit that's been sent shot from the bow of God's love Hallelujah when the eternity to Eternity was pulled together by the court of love God shot the era of Deliverance into the church on the day of Pentecost Christ was given into her hand the arrow of God Deliverance the holy spirit will deliver the church out of any kind of chaos it could get into it see the King was in chaos God delivered the king if the church gets in chaos God will deliver the church praise God through the arrow of God's Deliverance oh don't you love that Hallelujah he said that's a backsitting king they struck the arrow once and said well we'll build a church now look at that he says here's the three arrows we'll build a church as one Arrow of the king he says second we'll teach theology well third will teach psychology and have an organization he's that's about as far as the denomination can strike he says he said they struck sure on so many blessings he said but see the church like the king had struck short on the baptism of the Holy Ghost struck short on deliverance from sin he said brother when you get that baptism of the Holy Ghost it takes that old temper out of you it puts you on a dress it makes you act like a lady it'll make you quit your smoking lying stealing everything brother when you got the baptism the holy ghost that separates you and delivers you from the things of the world it makes you love God it makes you go to church it makes you worship Him it makes you tell your neighbor about it it makes you live above sin Hallelujah brother man said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he said Strike It Don't Be Afraid God said so I'm the Lord thy God that heal thee strike it God said so it's the era of Deliverance oh Hallelujah let's stand to our feet musicians can come here I didn't preach much over half an hour there 45 minutes brother Ram says the arrow was given to the church but sometimes worldliness creeps into our lives just acting like the world looking at situations and problems like the world will look at them rather than look at him through God's word so in other words every promise of God in here is an arrow that God wants to use in our lives it's an arrow of God's salvation Hallelujah I feel like there's one more one to read or maybe not so I want to bring it down to this church I want to bring it down to the personal life when I preach this I remember very distinctly I remember preaching this in that Waterloo hole in the wall over there remember there's a couple of us that were there that night and I remember each of us I know at least me and one other person were just shouting out arrows unto God it was on a Wednesday night just like this it was on the Wednesday night and I was just preaching saying whatever promise is in there strike the promise but Ram says strike it I'm the Lord thy God the heal thee strike it if you believe it shoot it out now let me say this you got to balance that and you got to ask what you have need of in that hour that King wasn't asking for a luxurious life he was asking for life itself to be delivered from the syrians right he wasn't asking for selfish things he was just asking to be delivered from the enemy so church we got to recognize what's the enemy doing in our lives and that's what we need victory over now when you recognize the enemy and when he's doing that's the area where God can give you an arrow to Smite that enemy but it's not just every desire of our heart right because some of those desires may change over the years the church said but it's clear in this in this in this text he had to ask for what was currently bothering him what drove him into the prince of the Lord so Church we've got to ask ourselves that what drives Us in the prince of the Lord tonight and then in your heart listen and see if the holy spirit is telling you to Smite something to shoot a promise of God into your lives into the atmosphere of Faith believe the promise of God let this let this scripture that I speak from my mouth let it be a symbol that God's given me salvation God's going to hear this request God's God's arrow is going to hit his Target amen ah praise God does God ever miss his Target of course not is God ever a failure of course not can God's word ever fail no Hallelujah can God's word return void of course not God's word will accomplish all that has been accomplished to do praise God Osman sent to do God's word will accomplish it let's play here let's bow our heads here for a word of Prayer Hallelujah church I remember on that night one other brother was asking certain requests for his children to be saved you know that night too I remember I was asking for my children to be saved [Music] in this race On That September 9 2014. Mr Spirit had me shoot up prayers Deliverance budget and look where I'm standing comparison to hit the target that's the target [Music] I remember that night really zealous I was really jealous if you might have been crying [Music] maybe you don't feel like the walls are closing on you but then let's have an arrow for somebody else who needs prayers [Music] the church from the context what we should pray for and desire is total Deliverance is there anything in your life where it's been a struggle and you want Total Deliverance you know it's the enemy that's what this verse is for eign [Music] at verse the Bible says Jesus cast The Devil out a woman of of sorry a child and the Bible said that the the evil spirit could no more enter in that child now that's a five arrow shot right there right there that's total Victory sister that evil spirit never comes back Hallelujah never total Victory praise God that's what I said about tobacco that's what I've said about the dirty magazines and the dirty movies they'll never come back because God grant us the ability [Music] Smite it speaking Lord speaking what do you want in your life a church if you desire the right things always think God's going to give them to you [Music] partial Victory is still good three cities was still good but God said you could have done double that there it is talents [Music] he couldn't he got three could have got six huh [Music] if you're in trouble and you know or you see someone in trouble and you need Deliverance let's see if God will put his hand on our how many would raise your hand say Lord put your spirit on me tonight before we fight if I put my hand on it it doesn't even matter what if the Lord Jesus puts his hand on my life [Music] raise your hand again if you want God to stand on your hand let's just believe father God I just strangely back to this nine years old we're using this and preaching the pressure Lord you're the one that said if you speak to this mountain it shall be before we know it's at the right time and season [Music] you're the one Lord I said ask anything in my name and I'll do it it's my any arrow and it'll hit the target the arrow Hallelujah Lord Jesus let our hands be like brother Ram said the hand of the and the Holy Ghost anointing our hands pour my hands up anoint my hands in other words anoint my lips Lord God speak through Me Lord let me speak my desires as you need me in the name of Jesus you see each of your heart and soul lord you see the hands that are grabbing the bow as it were tonight his hand she's grabbing that boat Mr Lydia's hand she's grabbing that boat tonight Mr Naomi's grabbing that boat tonight Mr Emma's grabbing that boat tonight brother Jose and Austin they're grabbing that boat tonight each one of us are grabbing that boat tonight hey Lord let your hand now anoint our head [Music] Hallelujah Lord the king came in a moment of desperation he needed to see God moved and Lord everything he asked you gave it to him racist the Bible said you're full of compassion verse 23 the Lord was gracious unto them had compassion on them and I respected them because of the Covenant with Abraham Lord we got the Covenant with the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah Lord put your hand on our hand now Lord the arrow Lord God give us give us salvation give us Deliverance the name of Jesus Christ the saint said
