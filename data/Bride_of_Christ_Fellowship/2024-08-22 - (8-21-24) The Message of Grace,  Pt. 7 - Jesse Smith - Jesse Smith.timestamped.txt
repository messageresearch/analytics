[0:00] word of God does not get stale and the
[0:01] church said the word of God cannot get
[0:04] stale Hallelujah we have the present
[0:06] truth as Peter says we're established in
[0:09] the present truth hallelujah so let's go
[0:12] to uh Luke chapter 23 and we'd like to
[0:15] start at the 39th verse a familiar
[0:18] perhaps uh story to us but I like to
[0:22] look at this story by the grace of
[0:25] God this is the last uh full story that
[0:29] uh brother Brandon had mentioned during
[0:31] this sermon and uh hopefully I can maybe
[0:34] try to get through it here tonight we'll
[0:35] see how the Lord leads it's all in God's
[0:37] hands how many enjoyed the message on
[0:39] David last Wednesday night anybody enjoy
[0:40] that message amen that was a wonderful
[0:42] message there all thanks to the Holy
[0:44] Spirit praise God so Luke
[0:51] 2339 of course this is the crucifixion
[0:54] of our
[0:56] Lord and we see Jesus uh surrounded by
[1:00] two
[1:09] thieves Now by God's grace uh I'm going
[1:11] to read 3940 41 but I like us to read uh
[1:15] 42 and 43 together you know with our
[1:18] voices together so I'll read uh 3940 41
[1:22] and then we can all read on 42 and
[1:24] 43 and one of the malactor which were
[1:27] hanged railed on him saying if if thou
[1:30] be Christ save thyself and us but the
[1:34] other answering rebuked him saying dust
[1:38] not thou fear God sing Thou Art in the
[1:42] same condemnation and we indeed justly
[1:46] for we receive the due reward of our
[1:48] Deeds but this man hath do nothing I'm
[1:51] sorry hath done nothing amiss let's read
[1:54] 42 and 43 on three 1 two 3 and he said
[1:58] unto Jesus Lord remember me when thou
[2:02] comest into thy kingdom and Jesus said
[2:06] unto him verily I say unto thee today
[2:10] shalt thou be with me in Paradise amen
[2:13] may God add his a blessing to the
[2:15] reading of this word you may be
[2:18] seated familiar story here um story that
[2:21] brings us a lot of hope by God's grace
[2:24] also also a lot of Revelation remember
[2:26] Sunday morning I preached on um uh this
[2:29] thought on the foolish virgins you know
[2:31] Jesus talked about two kinds of
[2:32] Christians there's wise virgins they're
[2:35] fully devoted to Christ they have the
[2:37] oil which represents the baptism of the
[2:39] Holy Ghost Hallelujah but then there's
[2:42] uh foolish virgins that only have a
[2:44] temporary amount of oil and they run out
[2:47] of oil right and so we know that means
[2:50] that a wise version has the baptism of
[2:52] the Holy Ghost in the soul because the
[2:55] Bible said when you have that you have
[2:56] the seal unto the day of your Redemption
[3:00] Hallelujah and that's the revelation of
[3:02] this hour the Revelation is that we need
[3:04] the Holy Ghost more than just on our
[3:06] body we like to feel it on our body uh
[3:08] you might tremble you might shout you
[3:10] might get goosebumps you might scream
[3:12] you might run you might jump we all
[3:14] appreciate that but that's going to
[3:15] eventually
[3:16] leave and then we like it on our minds
[3:19] as well because we we need a renewed
[3:21] mind we need a a Zeal to want to read
[3:24] the Bible right but our mind sometimes
[3:27] gets tired so so that anointing leaves
[3:29] too
[3:30] right the freshness of prayer leaves to
[3:32] so we need that to be
[3:34] renewed and uh the Bible doesn't call
[3:37] that that a seal so the only place
[3:40] that's left in a person is the soul and
[3:43] the Bible says when you're sealed with
[3:44] that you're marked with that unto the
[3:46] day of your Redemption and it's the
[3:48] Redemption of a brand new body
[3:50] Hallelujah and so that's what we would
[3:52] say you know we'd say pentacostal people
[3:54] today you know their their move started
[3:56] around 1906 but they failed to move on
[3:59] to the move of the mysteries of God
[4:02] being finished which God used brother
[4:04] brandom to to continue by God's grace
[4:07] and to finish that's what the
[4:08] Pentecostal had rejected just like uh
[4:11] just like this the wesan had rejected
[4:13] the Pentecostal message and just like
[4:16] the Lutheran had rejected the Wesleyan
[4:18] message so God kept sending more
[4:21] Revelation and so that's the Revelation
[4:23] that many Pentecostals and even the
[4:24] church I was Raising I love them you
[4:26] know my Assembly of God friends but that
[4:28] uh that's what they failed to realize
[4:30] they failed to realize that God had
[4:31] moved on and he had finished the
[4:33] mysteries of God through a prophet of
[4:36] God hallelujah and that's according to
[4:38] numerous verses like Revelation 10:7 uh
[4:41] Matthew
[4:42] 1711 uh ma I'm sorry Malachi 45 and 6
[4:45] turning the hearts of the children back
[4:47] to the apostolic fathers Hallelujah and
[4:51] uh that's one thing too you know uh I
[4:52] was when I was growing up they would uh
[4:54] they'd all call us these little children
[4:56] up to the Altar and pray for us and
[4:57] encourage us to speak in tongues and one
[4:59] time it sounded like I did and um so my
[5:02] mom was happy that I spoke in tongues
[5:04] but I don't know exactly if I did or not
[5:06] uh I was very emotional I was crying
[5:08] because there was a lot of emotion and
[5:10] loud music but as soon as I got done uh
[5:13] you know I just I stuck my sucker back
[5:14] in my mouth and ran outside and started
[5:16] playing baseball again you know so uh so
[5:18] I don't it wasn't like a real experience
[5:20] to me and um you know and and so I was
[5:24] kind of caught up in Emotion but but
[5:25] that anointing left right but see when
[5:28] you get it in your soul you have that
[5:30] anointing to the day of your Redemption
[5:32] praise God and and uh uh and like I said
[5:36] you know uh the Bible said do all speak
[5:39] in tongues in 1 Corinthians 12 and we
[5:41] know the answer to that is a no just
[5:43] like do all have gifts of healing no uh
[5:46] are all pastors and Prophets no right
[5:49] but God has given uh the gifts as it
[5:52] pleased him how many know the scripture
[5:54] so everybody has a gift and Every Man
[5:56] Has a gift to profit with all praise God
[5:58] so everybody has their special gift that
[6:01] God knows uh they can use for God's
[6:05] glory God gives each person a portion of
[6:07] talent praise God aren't you glad you
[6:09] have a talent tonight amen so the the
[6:11] the mystery of God's will is to find the
[6:13] talents you've been given and then
[6:15] exercise those be diligent with those
[6:18] and be a vessel that God can use a
[6:20] vessel of Honor that you can use those
[6:23] talents for God's glory now I just heard
[6:26] it today this is not my notes but
[6:28] remember First Kings 13
[6:30] remember that you had an old prophet and
[6:32] a young Prophet remember that story what
[6:34] an amazing story but here's a story
[6:37] where the old prophet he lied to the
[6:40] young prophet in the name of the Lord he
[6:42] lied and said the Lord said come in and
[6:44] eat with
[6:45] me right but then after they eat he he
[6:50] gives them a true prophecy that he's
[6:51] going to die and he gets eaten by a
[6:56] lion so there's a man that old Prophet
[6:58] is an example to us that our gifts we
[7:01] got to take care of them and we
[7:02] shouldn't play around with them we
[7:04] shouldn't be unfaithful with them
[7:06] because look he lied with a gift but
[7:07] then he got something right with the
[7:09] gift in the same
[7:11] chapter look at that who's that remind
[7:14] you of
[7:15] balum sometimes balam would seek
[7:17] enchantments and other times he'd seek
[7:19] the lord god
[7:21] Jehovah right so that's a good example
[7:24] right we must be careful with our gifts
[7:25] and we just saw it with Moses a couple
[7:27] weeks ago right he knew he had the power
[7:29] of God God and God said speak to the
[7:31] Rock but he smoked the rock it didn't
[7:33] come out the first time but it came out
[7:35] the second time because he had a gift he
[7:37] had Authority right so we must be very
[7:39] careful Church even with our gifts we
[7:41] must be careful to use them for God's
[7:43] Glory Hallelujah that story just struck
[7:45] me today I was really blessed by that
[7:46] just a reminder of that we got to be
[7:48] very careful how we use our gifts
[7:51] Hallelujah and so we're thankful uh for
[7:54] these Revelations by the grace of God
[7:56] but we've looked at how God's grace in
[7:58] this in this series on the message of
[7:59] Grace God's grace extended to Adam and
[8:01] Eve right Noah Abraham Israel the nation
[8:04] of Israel Moses and two weeks ago we
[8:06] looked at I'm sorry last week we looked
[8:08] at David today we're going to look at
[8:09] the thief on the cross Hallelujah the
[8:11] saved thief on the cross and how God's
[8:14] grace reach down to him Hallelujah now
[8:18] brother Bram said Sovereign Grace comes
[8:20] from a sovereign
[8:22] one okay so Sovereign means possessing
[8:26] supreme or ultimate power so God's
[8:29] sovereign he possesses supreme power
[8:31] above all others right because he
[8:34] created even the angels right he created
[8:36] humans everything he has supreme power
[8:39] another definition of sovereign is
[8:40] acting independently without outside
[8:43] interference so God acts however he
[8:46] wants he doesn't have to take into
[8:47] anybody's
[8:48] consideration right so God is Sovereign
[8:52] and God gives out Sovereign Grace
[8:54] because he's all powerful he can show
[8:55] Grace to whomever he wants now what's
[8:58] interesting about back back to that
[8:59] young Prophet story is that God had him
[9:01] killed he was just a young Prophet after
[9:03] he disobeyed one word of God but yet
[9:06] David disobeyed numerous Gifts of or
[9:08] sorry numerous words from the Lord but
[9:10] yet God had Grace on him and let him
[9:12] live interesting and see what do we do
[9:15] all we going to say is we don't know
[9:16] God's plans but we know God's plans are
[9:19] right and we would Dar ever speak
[9:22] against
[9:24] God because the Bible said sometimes
[9:26] when God takes people home at a young
[9:28] age and young people die the Bible said
[9:30] in Ezekiel that don't you know that God
[9:32] is sparing that young person from more
[9:34] evils later on in life God has a purpose
[9:38] Hallelujah God has a plan Hallelujah God
[9:40] has a story amen hallelujah he's the
[9:43] author and finisher of our stories amen
[9:45] and God is The Sovereign God he can do
[9:48] whatever he wants Hallelujah and he's
[9:50] not to be questioned he's to be believed
[9:53] hallelujah amen now God help us when we
[9:55] go through trials amen hallelujah we
[9:58] must trust that he's Sovereign and he
[10:00] gives Sovereign Grace Grace to the in
[10:02] the English language means free and
[10:05] unmar
[10:07] favor now that is a Bible good Bible
[10:10] definition too because in Romans 5:16
[10:12] and 18 the Bible calls salvation a free
[10:16] gift it's free that means you don't have
[10:18] to pay for it you just got to receive it
[10:20] praise God uh like today we gave z a a a
[10:24] gift uh about 8 o'clock this morning is
[10:26] a free gift he didn't earn that birthday
[10:28] gift and he enjoyed it all day he didn't
[10:32] he didn't he didn't turn it down and say
[10:34] oh I'm not worthy of this no he took it
[10:36] and sure he ripped it open piece by
[10:37] piece real real neat like rip this piece
[10:39] of wrapping paper off he he just
[10:42] accepted the gift and church that's what
[10:44] we've got to do we've got to accept the
[10:46] gift of God hallelujah don't let the
[10:48] devil tell you the gift's not for you
[10:50] the gift of salvation's for you
[10:52] Hallelujah the Bible said God would that
[10:54] all men be saved Hallelujah you must
[10:57] accept that he's given you salvation and
[11:00] you must accept it and when you accept
[11:02] it then you love God so much you repent
[11:03] of your sins and you turn 180 degrees
[11:06] around and you walk after righteousness
[11:09] instead of walking after pleasures and
[11:11] sins of this world remember we're not
[11:13] workers of iniquity we're workers of
[11:15] righteousness Hallelujah because of the
[11:17] love of God in our hearts Hallelujah and
[11:21] it's also unmar in Ephesians 2 8-10 says
[11:24] we're not saved by our our works lest
[11:27] any man should boast
[11:29] so now you see we get Sovereign Grace or
[11:32] we get an independent power giving us
[11:36] free and unmerited favor amen church we
[11:40] get to walk Our Lives we get to walk our
[11:42] lives here in 2024 and we have to
[11:44] remember we have God's unmar favor you
[11:47] didn't earn it you don't deserve it but
[11:50] if you've accepted it's yours Hallelujah
[11:53] and you've got to walk in the freedom of
[11:55] that Grace you've got to enjoy that
[11:57] Grace you got to be thankful for that
[11:59] Grace you have to remember that Grace
[12:01] hallelujah it's free and unmar you can't
[12:05] buy it you can't purchase it the Bible
[12:08] said in Romans N9 it's not him that
[12:10] runneth or him that willth but it's God
[12:13] who shows Mercy
[12:15] Hallelujah everybody see that by God's
[12:17] grace amen hallelujah now we know we
[12:19] have a responsibility to respond you
[12:21] just have to repent uh they said Peter
[12:24] in Acts chapter 2:36 what shall we do to
[12:26] receive the Salvation he said repent and
[12:29] be baptized every one of you in the name
[12:31] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[12:33] sins that means the sending away of your
[12:35] sins and you shall receive the Holy
[12:37] Ghost amen glory amen what a promise
[12:40] amen repent of your sins say God I'm
[12:43] sorry for lying for fornicating for
[12:45] adultery uh for drug use or witchcraft
[12:48] I'm sorry for that forgive me change my
[12:51] heart Hallelujah and I want your spirit
[12:53] to dwell in me I don't want demons to
[12:55] dwell in me praise God Amen Hallelujah
[12:58] now most some most of us as Sinners we
[13:00] know what it's like to have demons
[13:01] dwelling in us now you don't have to say
[13:03] Amen but I'll say amen I was deep in sin
[13:06] I was not I was not in control I
[13:08] couldn't handle my my my certain drug
[13:10] addiction I was it was it drove
[13:13] me right but when I come to Christ and
[13:16] repented slowly but surely God took away
[13:18] all those demons out of my life
[13:20] Hallelujah and now I'm free and now
[13:22] those Spirits can't drive me back to
[13:24] that because he whom the son has set
[13:27] free is free indeed amen
[13:29] Jesus broke the chains he set me free
[13:32] Hallelujah I know what it's like to be
[13:34] in chains but I also now know what it's
[13:36] like to be free hallelujah what did that
[13:39] the free gift of Grace amen it was God's
[13:42] unmar favor hallelujah
[13:46] amen and as I said before you know even
[13:48] dirty movies and dirty magazines God's
[13:50] fully delivered me from that by the
[13:52] power of the Gospel Hallelujah by the
[13:55] power of of the G of the Gospel of Jesus
[13:58] Christ hallelujah amen see think if you
[14:02] can be so uh given over to evil spirits
[14:04] if you can obey evil spirits that much
[14:07] think to the other side well surely you
[14:09] can obey God that way and surely God can
[14:12] give you more power amen hallelujah if
[14:15] the devil can do that and have power
[14:16] over you how much more can God's power
[14:19] lead and guide you and give you power
[14:21] and Grace and strength to overcome the
[14:23] Gates of Hell hallelujah amen God's
[14:27] greater than Satan Hallelujah amen
[14:30] because of this free and unmar favor of
[14:32] God we can live above sin be by the
[14:36] mercy of God Hallelujah by the love of
[14:40] God hallelujah I love what brother Ram
[14:42] said brother Ram said he can save a
[14:43] Wretch like Me and he did let's say and
[14:46] he did ready and he did he could save a
[14:48] WR like you and he already did it what
[14:52] am I saying I'm already saved it's in
[14:53] the past I'm saved I'm going to heaven
[14:56] I'm on my way to heaven shouting Victory
[14:58] Hallelujah Hallelujah he saved me I'm
[15:01] saved Hallelujah I already am a child of
[15:04] God I you already are a daughter of God
[15:07] hallelujah you're already saved you're
[15:09] on your way to heaven shouting the
[15:11] victory Hallelujah you're going to go
[15:12] there by the grace of God because he
[15:15] made a way you couldn't make it on your
[15:16] own but he gave you a free ticket a free
[15:19] gift and you're on your way to heaven
[15:21] hallelujah it's not by your Works amen
[15:24] you're not saved by that but if you ever
[15:27] got saved you'd appreciate it so much
[15:29] you'd want to serve god with the rest of
[15:30] your life Hallelujah that's right
[15:34] brother Ram said what is it it's Grace
[15:37] William brandham was a drunker son but
[15:40] that didn't make any difference the
[15:41] grace of God saved me no matter how
[15:44] dirty your family looked or how low down
[15:46] they were or or or just the the negative
[15:49] uh uh atmosphere around your family no
[15:52] matter how low you were Jesus
[15:54] specializes at reaching down deep and
[15:57] pulling you up out of your your pit and
[15:59] your myy clay he brought me out of the
[16:02] myy clay he set my feet on the Rock to
[16:04] stay Hallelujah and then he puts a song
[16:07] in my soul today Hallelujah a song of
[16:10] Praise
[16:12] hallelujah thank God Amen that's right
[16:15] church amen if God can save a drunker
[16:18] son he can save you and I
[16:20] Hallelujah doesn't make any difference
[16:23] God's grace can save to the uttermost
[16:25] Hallelujah he saves to the uttermost
[16:29] he brother R said he can take the vest
[16:31] Sinner and make him white as snow he's
[16:34] quoting uh Isaiah chapter 1 though your
[16:38] sins be as Scarlet he said I'll make you
[16:40] white as
[16:43] snow hallelujah praise God look at
[16:45] sister Lena's shirt that's kind of like
[16:47] the imagery right it's a red sweatshirt
[16:49] well God can take that and make it
[16:51] bright white like like sister Z's white
[16:53] jacket there it can go from that to that
[16:56] in the spiritual realm now it just
[16:58] worked out really good that's really
[16:59] perfect amen red and white cuz that's
[17:01] Isaiah
[17:03] 1 Glory he
[17:06] says uh it can do it because it's
[17:09] Sovereign because God don't have to ask
[17:11] the devil for permission well can I have
[17:13] brother Jesse devil can I please have
[17:15] him God can just take me amen God can do
[17:18] whatever he wants
[17:19] amen the Bible said no man sought God
[17:22] God sought man
[17:24] Hallelujah God was seeking after you
[17:26] God's grace was chasing you down amen no
[17:29] matter how far you ran from God God
[17:31] could run faster Hallelujah God could
[17:33] run faster after you chase you down and
[17:36] win you with his love Hallelujah when
[17:39] you realize sin is only pleasurable for
[17:41] a season sin only is fun for a season
[17:44] and then it turns destructive and then
[17:46] it turns hateful but then when God shows
[17:49] you his love it's easy to turn away the
[17:51] evil and accept the good
[17:53] Hallelujah isn't it evil to turn around
[17:56] like a a let's say a plate was full of
[17:58] maggots and on one side in another plate
[18:00] you had just fresh uh steak right out of
[18:02] the oven or something like that I mean
[18:04] it's easy to turn down the maggots right
[18:06] because it's disgusting that's how it is
[18:08] when you become a Christian you don't
[18:10] want to go back to the porn you don't
[18:12] want to go back to the marijuana you
[18:14] don't want to go back to that it's dirty
[18:15] it's disgusting you want to eat the
[18:17] fresh meat of the word
[18:19] amen that's right is that right church
[18:22] amen hallelujah now getting into my text
[18:26] here Luke 23 that's just a little
[18:27] introduction by God's grace
[18:30] amen I'm not I'm going to try not to be
[18:32] too long tonight I've been wearing
[18:34] myself out I I'm back to work this week
[18:35] and I'm fairly worn out by God's grace
[18:38] which is okay that's part of the part of
[18:40] the uh balance act
[18:42] Hallelujah but in Luke uh 23 we saw it
[18:45] 39- 45
[18:48] now what what's amazing we see in verse
[18:51] 40 the save Thief he offers a rebuke as
[18:55] he's dying think about that he's a dying
[18:59] man and he rebukes The Sinner for trying
[19:02] to rebuke Jesus think about that what a
[19:06] testimony you're dying really he's only
[19:09] got three hours left to live if they
[19:11] killed him right about the same time as

[19:16] of them off the crosses uh before the
[19:18] sun down right because of the the
[19:20] Passover they had to be down so he's got
[19:23] less than three hours to live and he
[19:26] stands up for Jesus he says don't don't
[19:28] you fear God because you're in the same
[19:32] condemnation right and he says we
[19:35] deserve this we're getting the reward
[19:37] for our Deeds so both thieves did
[19:39] something worthy of death they probably
[19:41] killed people they probably murdered

[19:44] an eye tooth for a tooth right we know a
[19:46] lot of laws are based on that the old

[21:34] stand up for Jesus we got to bring him
[21:37] into the situation we got to call him on
[21:39] the scene we're the ones who have to
[21:40] remember to pray for people praise God

[22:50] beautiful words verily I say un to you
[22:52] today shalt thou be with me in Paradise

[22:58] Spirits would descend down into the
[23:00] heart of the earth and down the heart of
[23:02] the earth you had the lost that were
[23:05] kind of in Satan's Chasm and then
[23:07] there's a there's a big uh Valley
[23:09] between the the lost and then Abraham's
[23:12] bosom so Jesus gives him this great
[23:15] promise don't even worry don't even

[23:42] today you'll be with me in heaven
[23:44] Hallelujah it was a paradise in in the
[23:46] Old Testament it was a paradise and then
[23:47] it went to heaven up to heaven in the
[23:49] New Testament but the equivalent of
[23:52] saying you'll be with me in heaven
[23:54] today because you stood up for me
[23:57] Hallelujah While others were mocking
[23:59] Jesus mocking Christians the save Thief
[24:02] stood up for
[24:03] Jesus Hallelujah he said Remember Me
[24:06] Jesus Remember that I've tried to serve
[24:08] you in these last moments of my life now
[24:11] the amazing thing Church you may have
[24:12] heard me say it before is in Mark 1532
[24:15] okay could you put that up there mark
[24:17] 15:32 the amazing thing that struck me
[24:19] years ago and I preached it to you uh
[24:21] it's okay if you don't remember I need
[24:23] reminders too uh Mark
[24:26] 15:32 actually let's read 30 31 likewise
[24:30] also the chief priests mocking and said
[24:31] among themselves with the scribes he
[24:33] saved others himself he cannot save so
[24:36] they're mocking Jesus he healed all
[24:38] these people he raised Lazarus from the
[24:39] dead he saved him but he can't save
[24:41] himself mocking
[24:44] him and of course brother Ram said you
[24:46] know as all the uh all the writers said
[24:48] if he would have saved himself he
[24:49] couldn't have saved others from their
[24:52] sins Hallelujah right that's why he
[24:55] didn't save himself he gave himself as a
[24:57] sacrifice H Allelujah verse
[25:01] 32 and let Christ the King of Israel
[25:04] descend now from the cross that we may
[25:05] see and believe and they that were
[25:07] crucified with him reviled him do you
[25:10] remember
[25:12] this in the midst of this three hours of
[25:15] of hanging on the cross at the beginning
[25:18] the save Thief was against
[25:21] Jesus think about that church he's got
[25:24] it doesn't matter if you think the nails
[25:26] are in the Palm or the wrist it doesn't
[25:27] matter he's he's got Nails in him he's
[25:30] not comfortable up there he's probably
[25:33] not singing you know a song special up
[25:34] there he's probably not you know reading
[25:36] his Bible up on the
[25:37] cross but even in the the last three
[25:39] think about think at the grace of God in
[25:41] the last three hours of his life he goes
[25:44] from mocking Jesus to saying standing up
[25:47] for Jesus amen that's the power of Grace
[25:50] right there even in the last three hours
[25:52] of his life he didn't deserve Grace but
[25:54] God still gave him Grace
[25:56] amen think of that the last three hours
[26:00] he goes from mocking Jesus joining in
[26:02] reviling him come on save us Jesus save
[26:04] us if you're the king of Israel and then
[26:06] all of a sudden he sees his character
[26:08] and he must have said forgive me he said
[26:10] you've done nothing wrong remember me he
[26:12] goes from mocking to worshiping in a
[26:15] matter of three
[26:17] hours Hallelujah church God is rich in
[26:21] Mercy amen think about that mocking
[26:24] God's son to his face but then with a
[26:27] matter of a couple hours turned to
[26:28] worshiping him and loving him that's a
[26:31] extra portion of Grace right there amen
[26:35] hallelujah brother Austin he did not
[26:37] have years of service to say look how
[26:39] many times I've gone to church Jesus he
[26:41] didn't have years of service look at all
[26:43] my prayers look at my all my fasting
[26:45] look at all my church attendance he
[26:46] didn't have that but Jesus Promised
[26:48] you'll be with me
[26:50] Hallelujah it shows we're not saved by
[26:52] works we're saved by Amazing Grace
[26:55] hallelujah amen thank God for this
[26:57] Amazing Grace Grace
[27:00] hallelujah what a change of heart you
[27:02] can go from mocking to worshiping in a
[27:05] matter of a few
[27:08] moments Hallelujah it reminds me of
[27:11] David remember David went from uh the
[27:12] Bible said uh when he had fallen with
[27:14] bash Sheba then he had Uriah killed he
[27:17] went from despising God and with a f a
[27:20] matter of a few maybe a year or
[27:22] something then he goes to worshiping and
[27:24] he says God created me a clean
[27:26] heart he despises why does the Bible say
[27:29] I can't have multiple wives and why does
[27:31] the Bible say I can't commit adultery
[27:32] why does the Bible say I can't murder
[27:34] the Bible said he despised God's
[27:36] word but then within a matter of a year
[27:39] he's you know he's he's uh he's tried to
[27:41] hide all his sin a matter of a year
[27:43] Nathan tells him he's wrong and God
[27:45] gives him Grace he should have died
[27:47] twice he deserved to die twice for the
[27:50] adultery and the murder but Nathan the
[27:53] Holy Spirit struck him and said Thou
[27:54] shalt not die but the sword will not
[27:57] leave your house
[27:59] you're given Grace to keep living but
[28:01] you're going to suffer that's amazing
[28:03] grace

[28:21] musician a Psalm of David when Nathan
[28:22] the prophet came unto him after he gone

[28:59] there was something brother Ram loved
[29:00] about Uriah he was so faithful he

[29:07] Brethren and his Devotion to the war

[34:08] this it wasn't well I guess it was just
[34:09] a last minute
[34:11] note you and I have a choice every day
[34:14] as a Christian are we going to be an
[34:15] authentic Christian or are we going to
[34:17] just adapt and try to be an Adaptive
[34:19] Christian what's the difference an
[34:21] Adaptive Christian you just come to
[34:23] church and just play along and try to
[34:24] say everything right to act like
[34:26] everything's okay but you've got sin in
[34:28] your life you've got failures that you
[34:31] haven't confessed uh you're babing sin
[34:34] you've got secret
[34:35] sin that that's just being an Adaptive
[34:37] Christian just trying to adapt and make
[34:39] sure nobody sees anything about my
[34:41] life but if you confess that and ask God
[34:44] to thoroughly Purge you then you could
[34:46] be
[34:47] authentic and I'm today I'm walking in
[34:49] the grace of God and you're asking that
[34:51] question remember read that this morning
[34:52] how holy can I be Lord God that's a good

[35:02] day how holy can I be today that's
[35:05] authentic then I'm not trying to hide
[35:07] well I don't want Mal I to know about
[35:08] this and I don't want my wife and I
[35:09] don't want my children to know about
[35:10] this that's being just adaptive you're
[35:12] just trying to adapt and and not not let
[35:14] everybody see I'm sorry to keep your sin
[35:16] in your life keep your secret sin but
[35:19] authentic Christian does like David Lord

[37:17] transgressors thy ways and sinners shall
[37:20] be converted unto thee see this is why
[37:22] some people never they never witness
[37:24] they don't witness as much as they
[37:25] should because they've got secret s sin
[37:27] in their
[37:28] lives right they they they don't feel
[37:30] confident to witness because they know
[37:32] they're loving
[37:33] sin and they need to ask God Purge me
[37:36] from my sin Purge me thoroughly so I can
[37:40] be a witness praise
[37:42] God all right praise God now I'm trying
[37:45] to move on here by God's grace I'm gonna
[37:46] move on from that but you can see
[37:48] David's change of heart right from
[37:50] despising God's word at 47 years old
[37:53] brother that's what the history says I'm
[37:54] like my what a what a thing 47 years uh
[37:58] for 10 years he had victories he was a
[37:59] king of all Israel 37 but this probably
[38:02] happened when he was 47 years old right
[38:05] the peak of his powers is when uh the
[38:08] enemy deceived him there and he was
[38:10] caught in the snare of the devil but God
[38:12] helped him to get out by God's grace
[38:17] Hallelujah now brother Ram said Jesus
[38:20] proved at the
[38:22] cross there was the viest thief he
[38:24] deserved to die God had never come
[38:27] across mind now brother's just
[38:28] dramatizing right we don't know that
[38:29] from the scripture he's just
[38:30] dramatizing the the thief never thought
[38:33] of nothing of it there on the cross when
[38:35] through those bloody lips in between the
[38:37] groans there came a sound Lord be
[38:38] merciful to me so he he hadn't thought
[38:41] about it remember he was mocking Jesus
[38:43] three hours before he died but then he
[38:45] gets he gets convicted he must have
[38:48] repented in his heart as we saw he's a
[38:50] secret sinner right I'm sorry secret
[38:52] believer right to the very end
[38:55] Hallelujah he says and there came
[38:57] another one back through the blood the
[38:59] tears the agony Grace took a hold and
[39:01] said today Thou shalt be with me in
[39:04] Paradise look look at that I love it if
[39:06] there's a deep call there's got to be a
[39:07] deep to respond amen the the same Thief
[39:11] he had a deep to call he had a deep call
[39:13] I've got a call to God and then there
[39:15] was a deep to respond in other words if
[39:17] you want to be saved God can save you
[39:20] Hallelujah if there if there's a desire
[39:22] in your heart to be free God can set you
[39:24] free hallelujah amen if you want the
[39:27] Holy Ghost there's a God out there to
[39:29] give you the Holy Ghost amen oh that's
[39:31] right church amen glory see grace did
[39:35] that how could that Thief help himself
[39:38] no more than Adam could help himself no
[39:40] more than Eve could help herself see
[39:43] Adam and Eve couldn't help themselves
[39:45] God had to come down and sacrifice the
[39:47] animals and clothe them with animal
[39:51] skins that's how God Saves you as well
[39:54] God said his son Jesus Christ and we're
[39:56] clothed with the character and the
[39:58] spirit of Jesus Christ
[40:01] Hallelujah see that God did it God gave
[40:04] us Amazing Grace he said no more than
[40:07] you can help yourself no more than I can
[40:10] help myself and I like this this is a
[40:12] funny statement he says no more than we
[40:14] could jerk ourselves up the milky white
[40:18] way in other words fly through space
[40:20] with our own
[40:21] bootstraps so I'm not sure what that
[40:23] exactly
[40:24] means but it's something like you could
[40:26] uh make Yourself by your own boots
[40:28] straps or something you could uh somehow
[40:30] have power to go out and fly past
[40:32] through the Milky Way or something like
[40:33] that you couldn't do that on your own
[40:36] some of us don't even believe they made
[40:37] it to the moon I have a hard time
[40:39] believing that if they can't figure out
[40:41] some of these things that we're
[40:42] struggling with now my goodness can't
[40:45] even get Wi-Fi certain areas and you
[40:47] made it to the
[40:48] moon come on
[40:51] whatever but it's you know all things
[40:53] are
[40:54] possible but it's just uh it's remember
[40:57] that God's grace did this we didn't do
[40:59] anything for it God did it for us
[41:01] hallelujah we can't save ourselves we
[41:04] can't help ourselves God had to help us
[41:06] God had to give us Grace and we've just
[41:08] got to receive it
[41:10] Hallelujah
[41:12] Glory he said we couldn't do it but the
[41:14] grace of God can do something about it
[41:16] and it does it The Sovereign Grace of
[41:19] God came to that dying Thief today Thou
[41:22] shalt be with me in Paradise think of it
[41:24] he says that's wonderful Hallelujah
[41:28] now there's six verses that bring Grace
[41:30] and love
[41:32] together uh brother R uh he mentions
[41:36] this he says before you can have Grace
[41:39] you have to have love uh put up
[41:41] Galatians 5:6 and this is speaking to uh
[41:45] I believe us and also God and I'll
[41:47] explain it with this verse Faith Works
[41:50] by love so love is the root of all works
[41:54] for God if you're saved you want to work
[41:57] for Jesus first because love love gives
[42:01] you faith and Faith then goes to work so
[42:05] it goes love first then you have faith
[42:07] in God and then you work for God am so
[42:11] if you got love you got faith you can
[42:12] work and you can give somebody
[42:15] Grace Hallelujah see people that have
[42:18] trouble forgiving others and giving
[42:20] Grace they need to check the their love
[42:22] uh their love bank account I'll say it
[42:24] like that their love tank to make sure
[42:26] they got enough love in their heart
[42:27] because if you've got love then you'll
[42:29] surely have faith then you can surely do
[42:30] the work of forgiving
[42:33] somebody that's right now let do take it
[42:36] to God how do uh brother Ram said love
[42:38] is first and then Grace how does God
[42:40] show Grace first because God is
[42:43] love amen I want to shout after that
[42:46] amen hallelujah praise God Amen God
[42:48] don't have to go get love God is love
[42:51] Hallelujah and because he's love he can
[42:54] extend Grace amen because you've got the
[42:56] love of God in your heart you can extend
[42:58] Grace to others
[43:00] Hallelujah they might not deserve it but
[43:02] that's okay you got the love of God the
[43:04] love of God allows you to express that
[43:07] Grace because I've received Grace I can
[43:10] surely share it amen hallelujah just as
[43:14] if you had a a billion dollars surely
[43:15] you could share a little bit of that
[43:16] with somebody and how many know the love
[43:19] of God is greater than a billion
[43:20] dollars a billion dollars will put you
[43:22] in a billion bunch of troubles right
[43:25] billion bunch of traps every friend you
[43:27] got is going to be calling for
[43:31] 50,000 right but if you got God's grace
[43:34] you got more than billion
[43:36] dollars Hallelujah because that that
[43:38] love of God is eternal it never had a
[43:40] beginning it'll never have an end
[43:43] Hallelujah glory to God Amen that's
[43:49] right brother said we find out Grace
[43:51] like the dying Thief no wonder it's
[43:53] inspired poets to write songs about it
[43:56] like there's a fountain filled with
[43:57] blood that dying Thief rejoiced to see
[44:00] that fountain in his day so see he
[44:03] realized Jesus was a Fountain of Grace
[44:05] amen at first he was mocking Jesus well
[44:08] he was on the right hand right so he
[44:09] would have been over here Jesus would
[44:10] have been in the middle he was mocking
[44:12] Jesus but then he realized wow Grace is
[44:14] Flowing out of here he just said father
[44:16] forgive them oh glory to God Amen he
[44:18] said father forgive them they don't know
[44:20] what to do if he's willing and he
[44:21] thought if he's willing to forgive those
[44:23] that are rebuking him surely he'll
[44:25] forgive me Hallelujah H amen I didn't
[44:28] see that to right now Hallelujah it was
[44:30] a fountain he saw the fountain filled
[44:33] with blood he said the dying Thief
[44:35] Rejoice to see that fountain in his day
[44:38] and there may I though vile as he wash
[44:41] all my sins
[44:44] away oh my glory to God
[44:48] Amen Jesus said father forgive them they
[44:51] don't know what they're doing and no
[44:52] doubt the sa Thief said I didn't know
[44:53] what I was doing when I murdered those
[44:55] people I didn't know what I was doing
[44:56] when I was doing those drugs drugs I
[44:57] didn't realize what I was doing on the
[44:59] pornography I didn't realize what I was
[45:00] doing when I when I had bitterness and
[45:02] wouldn't forgive I didn't realize but
[45:03] now I realize forgive me let Grace flow
[45:06] to me and church if you want Grace to
[45:08] flow to you it's willing to flow tonight
[45:11] Hallelujah that's
[45:13] right Hallelujah another writer said oh
[45:16] love of God how rich and pure how
[45:18] fathomless and strong think about you
[45:20] fathomless you can't fathom God's
[45:22] love it shall forever more endure Saints
[45:26] and angel songs in other words Saints
[45:29] and Angels they don't have enough words
[45:31] they can't sing long enough about the
[45:33] love of
[45:34] God when they get tired and finally stop
[45:37] singing in heaven God's love is still
[45:38] going to keep going
[45:40] on oh

[46:29] tells a story and it's just a very
[46:31] humble Simple Story you might not even
[46:33] think there's anything tremendous in it
[46:35] until you really start thinking about it
[46:37] and get spiritual
[46:38] minded and I'll I I'll challenge anybody
[46:41] after I read this let me know if you've
[46:42] ever heard a message preacher read this
[46:44] story before you know why they don't

[47:07] breath let's reset our minds and so you
[47:10] can listen to me I got important things
[47:12] to teach you and this is way more
[47:13] important than that brother bam said
[47:16] God's grace is like this let me tell you
[47:18] a story in
[47:19] ending God's grace is like this one time
[47:22] there's a mighty king this mighty king
[47:23] had a son and it was his only son one
[47:26] one day a murderer killed his
[47:32] son he said and through that Kingdom
[47:34] went the delegates hunting for that
[47:36] murderer they finally found that
[47:38] murderer and when they found him they
[47:40] brought him back and imprisoned him and
[47:42] when they did a trial was set and a
[47:43] sentence was made it was a terrible
[47:45] thing he'd murdered the King's son and
[47:47] know what was coming to him they put him
[47:50] in the inner cells they locked the doors
[47:52] they put pads on it and guards around it
[47:55] cuz what they knew knew what a kind of a
[47:58] horrible punishment this boy was going
[47:59] to
[48:02] receive because he killed the King's son
[48:05] the Royal King's son royalty he killed
[48:09] royalty guards was placed all around the
[48:11] doors and put in the cells the man was
[48:15] stripped nothing but a loin cloth on
[48:16] there he was and setting in that
[48:19] condition they starved him they barely
[48:20] let him eat anything he s in that that
[48:23] condition and they brought him out to
[48:24] the trial he was found guilty and proven
[48:26] guilty
[48:29] guilty and the sentence was made and he
[48:32] was to be executed under the horrible
[48:33] capital punishment he was to be killed
[48:36] cut in half by inches until his mortal
[48:39] life was gone sentenced by the judge he
[48:42] was to die and he begged and cried and
[48:44] said though I'm guilty though I'm guilty
[48:46] I'm sorry I did it I wish I'd never done
[48:48] it I'm sorry that I didn't in a moment
[48:50] in a rage of temper I did it I didn't
[48:52] mean to do it that way so look he cries
[48:55] for mercy everybody see the parallel
[48:57] here see where I'm going with
[49:00] this one day the king went down to the
[49:03] place the prison to visit the boy to
[49:05] talk to him and tell him about how he
[49:07] killed his own son the only son he
[49:10] had he said I'm going down to talk to
[49:13] him and when he went down there he
[49:15] looked back in the cage a and looked
[49:17] like a caged in animal so this this
[49:20] guilty murder looked like an animal in
[49:22] there barely had just any clothes on
[49:24] starving to
[49:25] death he saw that skinny little body
[49:28] laying there in a corner crying his face
[49:30] all sunk in his jaw sank back his eyes
[49:33] way back matter was all in his eyes and
[49:35] his mouth was all wided over no water
[49:37] thirsty laying back on his face crying
[49:40] and the King said stand
[49:42] up here he come to him and he looked at
[49:44] him and he said why' you kill my son
[49:46] what did my son do to you what did he do
[49:48] to Merit such a death as you killed him
[49:51] when you stabbed him to death with a
[49:53] spear so the king calls him right in
[49:56] front why' you do this and he said
[49:58] nothing my Lord not one thing your son
[50:00] didn't do not one thing just my own
[50:02] impudence just my own ways I killed him
[50:05] because I was jealous of him I got in a
[50:07] temper fit and I killed him now now I'm
[50:10] to die under your Justice sir I realize
[50:13] that and I deserve to do it the only
[50:15] thing I'm crying for I'm just sorry that
[50:18] I killed that Royal man like that
[50:20] without a
[50:22] cause the king turned on his
[50:25] heels walked out of the
[50:29] prison after that he went to the desk of
[50:32] the prison Ward and our brother worked
[50:34] in the prison right and said destroy all
[50:38] the
[50:40] records he said put them in the sea of
[50:43] forgetfulness destroy all the records
[50:46] wash him up clean him up I'll send down
[50:49] a robe for
[50:51] him after a while great big limousine
[50:53] drove up to the door when it did a
[50:55] carpet was spread out to the prison pron
[50:56] cell the king stood at the end of the
[50:58] limousine and said come my son ride home
[51:01] with me to the Palace he put the king's
[51:04] robe around his shoulder and said from
[51:06] henceforth you are my son is that the
[51:10] Gospel of Jesus Christ or
[51:14] not
[51:16] Hallelujah brother ramam said because
[51:19] the king had pity the king showed
[51:23] Grace that was me that was you
[51:27] we killed the Son of God with our sins
[51:30] we were all aliens the Bible said far
[51:33] from God dirty filthy laying in the
[51:36] cells of this
[51:38] world Hallelujah but God washed Us by
[51:42] the blood of his son cleansed us put the
[51:46] RO put on us the robe of the Holy Spirit
[51:48] and now the great Chariot of God will
[51:51] come back someday and take us up to the
[51:54] door of heaven and we'll go home to live
[51:56] with him all the records of our sins are
[51:59] destroyed and we can't be judged no more
[52:02] they're burned up he said they're put in
[52:04] the sea of forgetfulness and they're
[52:06] remembered no
[52:08] more no wonder we can sing Amazing Grace
[52:12] how sweet the sound that saved a Wretch
[52:14] like Me I was once was lost but now I'm
[52:17] found I was blind but now I see it was
[52:20] Grace that taught My Heart To Fear Grace
[52:22] my fears relieved how precious did that
[52:25] Grace appear the hour I first believed
[52:29] Hallelujah just a simple story of all
[52:32] the man said was I'm sorry I didn't mean
[52:34] to do it have mercy on me and the King
[52:36] said Okay I accept that humble apology
[52:39] it's not going to bring my son back but
[52:41] I accept it I have pity on you I'm going
[52:43] to show you Grace and I'm going to put
[52:45] the honor of my son on you that's what
[52:48] God did for us he he put the honor of
[52:50] Jesus on us he put the spirit of Jesus
[52:53] on us hallelujah amen why because he p
[52:57] do you want scripture for that I'll be
[52:59] happy to give you a scripture for that
[53:01] Psalm 103 Hallelujah verse 12 as far as
[53:06] the East is from the West so far he hath
[53:09] removed our transgressions from
[53:12] us amen all the record that were against
[53:16] you the king said destroy them rip them
[53:19] up burn them up and they'll go go throw
[53:20] those ashes in the sea so they're never
[53:23] found again there's no more charges
[53:25] against brother Jose
[53:27] Jesus dropped the charges against sister
[53:28] Naomi Hallelujah there's no more charges
[53:31] sister who God done away with them he
[53:33] separated them as far as the East is
[53:35] from the West because of verse 13 like
[53:39] as a father pies his children so the
[53:42] Lord pth them that fear Him
[53:46] Hallelujah God looks on us and he knows
[53:48] the evil things we've done but he still
[53:50] has pity and he says if you just repent
[53:54] if you just say sorry I will wipe away
[53:56] all your sins and I'll give you the
[53:59] honor that my son had when my son paid
[54:02] for your sins on the cross of Jesus
[54:04] Christ amen let's stand to our feet
[54:06] Hallelujah musicians can
[54:12] come verse 14 said God knoweth our frame
[54:16] for he knoweth our frame he rememberthe
[54:19] are dust he remembers the weakness of
[54:22] our
[54:23] flesh sometimes we just got to we just
[54:25] give into the Flesh and do what our body
[54:27] wants God remembers that he'll have pity
[54:29] on us and if we just say sorry God
[54:32] forgive me God will accept us he'll wipe
[54:35] away all of our sins he'll thoroughly
[54:37] cleanse us if we'll let him
[54:40] Hallelujah and then he'll put the honor
[54:42] of his son on
[54:46] us now who's heard a preacher preach
[54:48] that story before
[54:50] anybody I didn't think I would I'm going
[54:53] to be very honest because I've never
[54:55] heard a preacher I've been listening to
[54:56] mess sermons for 20 some years I've
[54:58] never heard a preach that why because it
[54:59] puts all the guilt on you and
[55:02] me everybody just likes to say you never
[55:04] did in the first place but remember as
[55:05] my wife reminded me brother Ram said it
[55:08] was as though you never did it in the
[55:10] first place it's like as though you
[55:13] never did it in the first
[55:15] place Hallelujah everybody understand
[55:19] it's your soul that never
[55:21] sinned right because the Bible said
[55:23] you're you're dead in sins but then the
[55:25] Holy Ghost is the seal in your your soul
[55:27] you get the spirit of God it it make it
[55:29] takes it from Death to life and that
[55:31] spirit of God that's a part of you that
[55:33] Spirit never sin in the first place but
[55:36] the the Flesh and the mind still sins
[55:38] every
[55:39] day
[55:41] Hallelujah but Jesus in heaven is so
[55:43] gracious if we confess our sins he said
[55:45] I'll thoroughly wipe them all away I'll
[55:47] separate them as far as the East and
[55:49] from the rest I will remember them no
[55:51] more he even puts them out of his memory
[55:53] that's how much he loves his children
[55:55] praise God amen that's how much he wants
[55:57] you to forget your sins and live a holy
[56:01] life how many feel more determined to
[56:03] live a holy life tonight
[56:05] amen let's do it by the grace of God we
[56:08] can do it also we got to say Jesus is
[56:10] wash me wash me thoroughly wash my mind
