[0:03] Verse one. Colossians 2 verse one. God's
[0:25] grace. So what kind of inspired this? I
[0:28] came across numerous uh quotes in the
[0:30] last few weeks where brother Ram talks
[0:31] positively about the word trinity and
[0:34] just kind of stirred something up within
[0:35] me and then I had that debate with or
[0:37] the kind debate with a nice trinitarian
[0:38] pastor there that kind of got me stirred
[0:40] up and then someone tried to tell me
[0:42] that brother Ram never believed in the
[0:44] trinity and I thought well I know better
[0:46] than that I know he believed in the
[0:47] trinity so I went and studied it out and
[0:49] I
[0:49] got number of uh hours there studying
[0:52] into that this week so I just thought
[0:53] I'd just preach on it here uh the main
[0:56] point I would like to show today is the
[0:57] quotes of brother Brandham, how they how
[0:59] they progressed throughout his ministry.
[1:02] And I actually what I I'll show you what
[1:04] I found to be the moment that he started
[1:06] changing his understanding on the
[1:08] Godhead. Of course, we most of us know
[1:11] when he spoke with thus sayith the Lord
[1:12] because we've been through it recently
[1:13] with thus sayith the Lord,
[1:15] trinitarianism is of the devil, right?
[1:17] We went through that recently. Um and so
[1:19] I want to build up to there so everybody
[1:21] can see how he grew in Revelation by the
[1:23] grace of God. So, Colossians 2 verse
[1:26] one. I'll read verse one. Then we can
[1:27] all read verse two
[1:29] together. For I would that ye knew what
[1:32] great conflict I have for you and for
[1:33] them at Leodysa. And for as many as have
[1:37] not seen my face in the flesh. Let's
[1:40] read verse two together. Ready? One,
[1:41] two, three. that their hearts might be
[1:44] comforted, being knit together in love,
[1:48] and unto all riches of the full
[1:50] assurance of understanding to the
[1:54] acknowledgment of the mystery of God and
[1:57] of the Father and of Christ. Let's read
[2:00] three as well because that's a great
[2:01] verse. One, two, three. In whom are hid
[2:04] all the treasures of wisdom and
[2:07] knowledge. May God add his blessing to
[2:09] the reading of his word. You can be
[2:10] seated.
[2:18] So, we'll take a little hour here
[2:20] tonight, Lord willing, and we'll kind of
[2:21] uh get to the point at the end. I just
[2:24] want to show brother Ram's progression.
[2:25] I found at least 22 or more quotes where
[2:28] brother Ram spoke positively about the
[2:30] Trinity. And I'm talking about three
[2:32] persons. I'm not talking about just the
[2:35] word trinity because we know the word
[2:36] trinity uh if you've studied it lately
[2:39] in of itself it's not a bad word uh it
[2:42] just means three closely related persons
[2:44] or things well we don't take persons we
[2:47] take things or
[2:50] manifestations and uh again this was
[2:53] kind of all brought up upon me because
[2:56] about three Thursdays ago we went to
[2:57] this family house and had a real good
[2:59] time and as we started talking he this
[3:01] preacher said he's a reformed minister
[3:04] Now, reformed uh kind of means like
[3:07] they're Calvinistic, you know, like uh
[3:10] so Calvinism is more like once you're
[3:12] saved, always saved. It's kind of like
[3:14] that. And then uh they're they're
[3:17] sessationist to the fact that there's no
[3:20] more uh apostolic gifts. So like major
[3:24] miracles you see in the book of Acts,
[3:26] like the apostles, because they're dead,
[3:28] you don't see any of those major ones
[3:29] anymore. But they do believe in
[3:32] miracles. Okay? And of course they're
[3:34] staunch trinitarians. I mean staunch. Um
[3:37] now they also believe they have a better
[3:39] translation of the Bible. That's where I
[3:40] differed with the man as well, but uh in
[3:43] a friendly way. So this uh kind of uh
[3:46] impromptu debate kind of stirred me up a
[3:48] little bit as far as uh the godhead and
[3:50] and this gentleman and I have been
[3:51] emailing back and forth and we really
[3:52] just come to the spot. We're just going
[3:54] to agree to disagree uh on most
[3:57] things. But as you know, as we had this
[3:59] maybe an hour, maybe 45 minutes. Again,
[4:01] I'm not good at estimating time or
[4:03] remembering time, but maybe it was half
[4:05] an hour, but dur I was more okay. Well,
[4:08] this time I'm short. Wow, that's rare.
[4:11] I'm actually short. I usually
[4:12] overestimate things. Um, you know, of
[4:16] course, I was nervous because I wasn't
[4:17] really prepared. I didn't have I wasn't
[4:18] studying on the Godhead. But as time
[4:20] went along, I just got more relaxed. And
[4:22] it all boiled down to this. You know,
[4:24] when we talked about different verses,
[4:26] we both agreed on the verses. um we just
[4:30] didn't agree on the word
[4:32] person. Okay. Uh and a person is someone
[4:35] who has a separate
[4:37] personality, right? Uh and and it boiled
[4:41] down to this. And I said, you know, I
[4:43] don't believe any or I'm sorry, I
[4:45] believe every word in the Bible about
[4:47] the Godhead. And I said, the trouble
[4:49] with your belief is that you're adding
[4:51] to the Bible. And of course, he was kind
[4:54] to accept that. He said, I was a
[4:55] heretic. Well, I said, well, I believe
[4:56] you're a heretic, too. and we just agree
[4:58] while we're eating our supper, you know,
[5:01] uh we just agreed to be uh to believe
[5:04] each other was a heretic. But I left
[5:05] there really stirred up like, "Praise
[5:07] God, there's no way he can defeat our
[5:09] revelation. Praise God." Now, he'd
[5:11] probably say the same thing, right? But
[5:13] when it all boils down to it, who's
[5:15] adding to the Bible? Okay. And as we'll
[5:17] see again, there's such awful fruits.
[5:20] So, can you switch over? Let me I shared
[5:22] this a couple years ago when I preached.
[5:24] Let me just share this example here.
[5:26] Here's here's the modern-day fruits of
[5:28] trinitarianism. You probably remember
[5:29] this, don't you? Everybody remember that
[5:32] maybe faintly. Okay, you have you have
[5:35] the head of the Catholic Church shaking
[5:37] a Catholic president's hand when he was
[5:39] president. Okay, now what are these
[5:41] people? They're trinitarian. They're
[5:43] pagan idolattors because if you go back
[5:45] to the actual definition, they say uh
[5:48] God the Father, God the Son, God the
[5:50] Holy Ghost. Three separate persons who
[5:53] are fully God. Although they're not
[5:55] saying it, they're they're actually
[5:56] declaring tritheism. Three gods is what
[5:59] they're actually saying. And as I asked
[6:01] my good trinitarian friend there, I
[6:03] said, "Why would the second person when
[6:05] he's being baptized who's already fully
[6:07] God, 100% divine, why does he need two
[6:11] other 100% divine people to fill him?"
[6:14] Okay? And he didn't and uh he didn't
[6:16] have an answer. Okay? He didn't have an
[6:19] answer. So they they won't admit it, but
[6:21] they're idoltors, right?
[6:25] and adulterers. This man's been married
[6:26] twice, the former president. Murder.
[6:29] What I mean by that is they funded
[6:31] millions of abortions, not just in this
[6:33] country, but in other
[6:34] countries. So, they're they're uh uh
[6:38] they're accompllices, that's the word.
[6:39] Some days I can actually remember the
[6:40] word. They're accompllices to murderers,
[6:43] supporting murder. Okay. Uh and of
[6:46] course uh we know if you know anything
[6:48] about history u during the the dark ages
[6:52] there in Rome uh the priests and nuns
[6:56] had relations and had many abortions
[6:58] there as well right there in Rome. And
[7:01] at one point I forget how many thousands
[7:03] again I I probably I probably botched
[7:05] the estimate I think it was a thousand
[7:08] uh of those nuns were prostitutes if not
[7:10] more if not more. of course in in
[7:13] secret, you know, to the priests and
[7:15] everything like that, but it's it's the
[7:16] whole history of it is is is abominable.
[7:19] So, they're abominations. And now what I
[7:21] mean by witchcraft is uh the cocaine
[7:23] that was found in the White House last
[7:25] year. Remember that? Oh, and they just
[7:28] couldn't figure that out with all the
[7:29] cameras in there and the best security.
[7:30] I can't figure who brought that in. No,
[7:32] I can't figure that out. Uh and then of
[7:35] course the president's son was was has a
[7:38] laptop full of all that uh being funded
[7:41] by tax dollars. That's the wickedest
[7:44] part of it. Well, one of the most wicked
[7:46] parts of it. And so this is what we
[7:48] would say a more modern th this is what
[7:50] the Catholic Church or the the
[7:51] trinitarian doctrine has produced. Now
[7:53] it doesn't produce that in every church,
[7:55] but it will produce something. As I saw
[7:57] with my dear uh uh my dear friend, you
[8:01] know, uh the reformed friend, they still
[8:02] let the women wear makeup and cut their
[8:04] hair and wear pants and crossdress.
[8:07] Abomination. Because if if you let a
[8:09] little levan in there, it's going to
[8:10] spread. If you don't clean it out, it's
[8:12] going to spread. Hallelujah. Just as we
[8:15] know, if we don't clean out our our
[8:16] lives, the sin's going to spread into
[8:18] other areas of our lives. Okay. So, I'm
[8:20] going to go way back here and eventually
[8:23] get to this. This is from an old sermon
[8:24] when I preached that series on the
[8:25] godhead. But I'll start right there. Uh
[8:27] and of course I write a whole chapter on
[8:29] this in the book, but the main
[8:30] contradiction uh is here uh is the
[8:34] father is not the holy spirit, right?
[8:37] Because if if if that's true, then Jesus
[8:38] had two fathers. And I forget how the
[8:40] man explained that, but it didn't make
[8:41] any sense to me. Uh because if they're
[8:44] separate, if they're separate now,
[8:45] they're separate. They're distinct.
[8:47] They're not the same person. They're two
[8:48] they're two different persons.
[8:51] Well, then how can how can how can Jesus
[8:53] have one dad if they're two separate
[8:54] persons and he's conceived of the Holy
[8:57] Ghost? I think the man's wording, my
[8:59] friend's wording was, "Well, God used
[9:01] the channel of the the Holy Ghost."
[9:03] Well, that doesn't fit the scripture.
[9:06] That's not what the scripture says. The
[9:08] scripture says the Holy Ghost
[9:09] overshadowed Mary to conceive the body
[9:12] of Jesus. So, they try to get around it,
[9:15] but of course, uh, of course, they're
[9:18] they're going to be adding to the word
[9:19] of God. All right. So, just a little
[9:22] introduction there by God's grace. And
[9:24] of course, the word tritheism is the
[9:26] doctrine that there are three distinct
[9:27] gods. They'll never say that, but they
[9:29] say God the Father, God the Son, God the
[9:31] Holy Ghost, right? And there's no such
[9:34] thing. Look up God the Son. God the Son
[9:35] is not in the Bible, right? You see, God
[9:38] the Father's in there. Even God the Holy
[9:40] Ghost isn't in there. Unless Brother Cam
[9:42] and I were talking on Saturday, how come
[9:44] in all Paul's greetings, he always
[9:46] leaves out the Holy Ghost? He always
[9:48] like, "Blessed be the God and father of
[9:50] our Lord Jesus Christ who's blessed us
[9:51] in heavenly places." He never mentions
[9:53] the Holy Ghost. Why would he leave out a
[9:55] third co-equal person? Why would you do
[9:57] that if he's co- if the third person is
[9:59] co-equal? Uh why would you leave him
[10:02] out? If he's equally important, why
[10:03] would you leave one person out? Doesn't
[10:05] make any sense, right? Uh so a very good
[10:09] point there. Uh we want to make that
[10:10] point by God's grace. All right. Uh and
[10:14] then yeah, we'll get to that. I kind of
[10:15] want to again close with that.
[10:18] But just again a visual there's 8
[10:19] billion people on the earth. You know
[10:21] 2.3 billion are trinitarians. Two
[10:23] billion are atheists or agnostics. Two
[10:25] billion are
[10:26] Muslims. Okay case false god. 1 billion
[10:29] Hindus. That's multiple that's millions
[10:30] of gods if not more. Uh 24 million are
[10:34] one is Pentecostals and two to four
[10:36] maybe are message believers. But that
[10:38] number goes down every day. Right?
[10:40] Because these these people that are
[10:41] leaving the
[10:43] message. All right.
[10:47] So uh we get that. Now also remember
[10:50] trinitarianism uh comes from and I don't
[10:53] remember which nation this was uh but
[10:55] that was Egypt right e Egypt has Isis
[10:57] set and
[10:59] Osiris as three three deities right and
[11:03] so we have uh there's multiple examples
[11:04] I got it written down in my book the
[11:06] Hindu Hindu has a trinity as well
[11:08] they've all got uh Satan's done this in
[11:10] other religions and he's just brought it
[11:12] over to pervert the Christian church
[11:15] right because they wonder then who do I
[11:17] pray to uh who do I uh who who who do I
[11:21] seek and do I seek the father or the son
[11:23] or the holy ghost? And then the
[11:26] Catholics say like Malachi saw that
[11:28] video. Um, you know, Jesus is so busy.
[11:30] Well, let's pray to Mary,
[11:32] right? Surely Jesus will listen to Mary
[11:35] just like he did with with the wine,
[11:36] right? That that's their that's their
[11:39] nonsense. It doesn't even make sense.
[11:41] It's nonsense,
[11:43] right? Okay. Then that's the picture.
[11:45] That's the picture that they all have in
[11:46] their minds. Okay. But remember, there's
[11:49] no scripture where Jesus, it says Jesus
[11:50] has brown hair in heaven, right? He's
[11:53] always got white hair, white like
[11:55] wool. Oh, yeah. Cam had a good point
[11:58] about the dove. How can a dove make Mary
[12:02] conceive? A
[12:03] dove, right? A dove. And every time it
[12:06] speaks of the Holy Ghost, uh, it's got
[12:08] to be a dove. Well, how does that work?
[12:10] There's no mention of a dove in
[12:12] heaven,
[12:14] right? So, they're equal. So, there's
[12:17] all these uh all these, of course,
[12:20] problems and contradictions. Uh in my
[12:22] book I have the Aanian creed and there's
[12:23] I have s I I found six contradictions
[12:25] just in the creed and so it's just full
[12:28] of con uh uh contradictions. Now the
[12:31] Bible word is manifestation and my
[12:33] friend looked at me and he says why are
[12:35] you twist twisting the word
[12:36] manifestation to fit your doctrine? I
[12:38] said I'm not twisting the scripture. I'm
[12:40] using the scripture to make a
[12:42] doctrine. I thought that's a pretty
[12:44] harsh accusation there. I'm twisting a
[12:46] scripture.
[12:48] um my doctrine or my my my my my
[12:51] doctrine is based upon the scripture.
[12:53] And I said, you well, you're the one
[12:54] who's adding to the scripture, right?
[12:56] You're three persons is not in the
[12:58] Bible. So, remember first Tim uh I'm
[13:01] sorry. Yeah. Okay, I'll have this up
[13:02] here. Uh 1 Timothy
[13:04] 3:16, of course, says God was manifest
[13:07] in the flesh. Okay. And then I got to
[13:09] look up uh 1 Corinthians, I think it's
[13:12] 12:7, if I'm not mistaken. 1 Corinthians
[13:14] 12:7.
[13:20] Yes. 1 Corinthians 12:7. So the son is
[13:22] called a manifestation which means an
[13:24] appearing. Uh and the holy ghost in your
[13:27] life is called a
[13:29] manifestation. Verse 12. 1 Corinthians
[13:32] 127. Sorry I said verse it's verse 7.
[13:35] It's chapter 12. But the manifestation
[13:38] of the spirit is given to every man to
[13:40] profit with all. So the holy ghost is
[13:43] God the father. But when the Holy Ghost
[13:45] comes upon us, now it's a manifestation.
[13:48] It's appearing in another way.
[13:49] Hallelujah. Okay? Or it's an expression.
[13:52] That's the word the brother had in his
[13:53] new uh translation of the Bible. Or
[13:56] exhibition or be
[13:59] bestowment or appearing. So uh let's use
[14:03] Bible words. If we're going to be Bible
[14:04] believers, yet let's use Bible words.
[14:06] Hallelujah. And uh my title for today is
[14:09] growing in the Godhead and looking at
[14:11] the life of brother Brandham. So we get
[14:13] growing in grace in second Peter chapter
[14:15] 3. So let's go there. Second Peter
[14:16] chapter 3. Just a quick brief overview
[14:20] here. Peter ends the book uh in verse uh
[14:24] six, I'm sorry, 18. 2 Peter 3:18. But
[14:27] grow in grace and in the knowledge of
[14:29] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him
[14:31] be glory both now and forever.
[14:34] Amen. So uh there there's room for us to
[14:37] grow in the knowledge. The knowledge of
[14:40] course is a deep
[14:42] understanding. And so we are uh called
[14:44] to grow in grace. And I'll say like
[14:46] this. Let's recognize that we need more
[14:49] grace. Let's rec and let's give grace to
[14:51] other people. Praise God. We could grow
[14:53] in that area of grace. And of course, we
[14:55] can grow in the knowledge of the Lord
[14:57] Jesus Christ. You know, I look at uh I
[14:59] look at the chapter I wrote and wow, I I
[15:01] I grew in a lot of knowledge over the
[15:03] years. I didn't know all that when I
[15:04] first came in the message, right? But I
[15:06] was able to grow in the understanding
[15:08] and still just keep everything with the
[15:10] scripture. Just stay in with the word of
[15:12] God. And recently remember I showed you
[15:14] the timelines of how uh the baptism was
[15:17] changed around 100 AD and then they
[15:19] started getting the word trinitas and
[15:21] trinity you know about 200 to 300 AD.
[15:24] Then you have the council na where
[15:26] Constantine went all in. He started
[15:27] funding the church and then it became
[15:30] the false church right he married church
[15:32] and state.
[15:34] Okay. So we uh understand that by God's
[15:37] grace. Okay. Now uh I want to few lay a
[15:41] few more. Now remember Proverbs 35 and 6
[15:44] says to not add to the word of God.
[15:46] Let's read that. Proverbs 35 and
[15:56] 6. We go. Every word of God is pure.
[16:00] He's a shield unto them that put their
[16:01] trust in him. add thou not unto his
[16:04] words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be
[16:07] found a liar. So, if God reproves you,
[16:10] he's going to show you that he's right.
[16:13] Uh he's going to convict you that you're
[16:15] wrong. That's what one of the word, one
[16:16] of the definitions is, rebuke
[16:19] you.
[16:21] Hallelujah. So, uh and then God calls
[16:24] them liars. Now, think about that. All
[16:26] these trinitarians when they go to
[16:27] heaven, they're going to find out they
[16:29] they were lying. Now, brother Ham sainly
[16:32] or plainly says it. I can't even speak
[16:33] tonight. Uh plainly says it and the
[16:36] Bible does too. God winks at ignorance
[16:38] until you understand the truth. Right?
[16:41] Because in the Bible, he said he winked
[16:43] at it and but now he's commanding
[16:44] everyone to repent, right? But we still
[16:47] get the we get the principle that God
[16:49] winks at ignorance until you know the
[16:51] truth. Right? And the the best example
[16:54] is what brother one of the brothers
[16:55] asked I think it was brother Claude uh
[16:58] how God is going to wink at the Jews for
[17:01] rejecting Christ according to the fifth
[17:02] seal and it's thus sayeth the Lord
[17:04] because of Romans 11 God has to blind
[17:07] them for a season because the Jews
[17:09] rejected the Messiah. God blinds them
[17:12] and he gets him a gentile bride.
[17:14] Hallelujah. You should be glad you're
[17:16] the Gentile bride. Hallelujah. We're
[17:18] very thankful we're the gentile
[17:20] bride. Okay. And then we're familiar.
[17:22] We're not going to read it, but
[17:23] Revelation 22 says, "If you add to the
[17:25] word the prophecy, then the plagues are
[17:28] added to you. If you take away, your
[17:30] name will be taken out of the book of
[17:32] life, but only if you're aware of it."
[17:35] Praise God. Because look at John Wesley,
[17:38] Martin Luther, right? They they believe
[17:40] God was a trinity. Martin Luther wrote
[17:42] songs about the Trinity. That's how much
[17:44] he loved the Trinity. Um we we sang I
[17:47] think I don't think he wrote that one,
[17:49] but um we sang the song Holy Holy Holy.
[17:51] I just changed the lyrics. You know,
[17:53] God's one true person, bless divinity.
[17:56] Hallelujah. Not three. Yeah. Yeah.
[17:57] Brother, that's right. Brother Daniel
[17:59] from Junction City said, he said, "You
[18:00] sang that one time and you changed the
[18:02] lyrics." He said, "Can you share those
[18:03] lyrics with me?" I said, "Yes, sir. They
[18:05] were divinely inspired, I think, to get
[18:08] rid of the three persons and give it
[18:10] back to one. God's one true person
[18:12] because it's one God manifest in the
[18:14] flesh."
[18:16] Hallelujah. Okay, so that's a little bit
[18:18] of a foundation there. And uh like I
[18:19] said, I'm going to be a little heavier
[18:20] on quotes here tonight, but remember,
[18:22] Brother Ram says, "God doesn't tell his
[18:25] prophets everything."
[18:27] So, you're going to see here. Yeah, it's
[18:29] just striking me now. For about 20
[18:31] years, Brother Ram agrees with the
[18:33] Trinity full go, fully believes with it
[18:36] for he preaches for 20 years
[18:40] uh that that uh that God is three
[18:42] persons and agrees with it. Says he
[18:44] loves the trinity. He says the trinity
[18:47] is in his heart.
[18:49] I believe in the second third person as
[18:51] I'm going to read it to you for 20 years
[18:53] and all of a sudden God gives him
[18:55] revelation. Then he starts noticing
[18:58] things about it and then eight years
[19:00] after that then he says thus sayeth the
[19:01] Lord it's of the
[19:03] devil. See because he starts reading
[19:05] history and starts putting it all
[19:06] together and sees it. You know church
[19:09] there's a story of uh the late brother
[19:11] James Browning. What a good Browning.
[19:13] What a good pastor. He was the pastor up
[19:15] in Sheffield before brother Samuel. Of
[19:16] course, he was his father. But he told
[19:18] me this story. He said, "For years, I
[19:20] took this quote where brother Brandham
[19:21] said this uh quote about Jesus baptism."
[19:25] And brother Brandham says this quote and
[19:26] the voice came when Jesus was baptized
[19:28] and said, "This is my beloved son in
[19:30] whom I'm well pleased to dwell in." Now,
[19:33] did I say that? Did I quote the
[19:34] scripture right? Yes or no? No. Let's
[19:38] read it. Matthew chapter 3. So, Brother
[19:40] Ram for years said this, and I'm not
[19:42] sure if he ever corrected it u on tape.
[19:47] So, brother James would take that quote
[19:48] and he would tell Trinitarians, well,
[19:50] no, uh, when Jesus was baptized, uh, the
[19:53] voice said, "Whom I'm well pleased to
[19:55] dwell in." So, see, the father had to
[19:57] dwell in the sun. And eventually the
[19:59] trinitarian's like, "Brother James, it
[20:00] does. The Bible doesn't say that." And
[20:01] he's like, "Yes, it does. Brother Bam
[20:03] said so." And he went back to the Bible
[20:06] and found out it doesn't say
[20:08] that. So, what did Brother James do? Did
[20:11] he say, "Well, I believe every word on
[20:12] the tape. I'm going to press play and
[20:14] obey. A prophet of God is inspired. No,
[20:17] he he had realized, oh, I've got to
[20:18] balance. I've got to take everything
[20:20] back to the word. I've got to prove all
[20:22] things like the Bible. And brother
[20:24] Brandham
[20:25] said, Matthew chapter 3, it's at the end
[20:28] of the
[20:30] chapter, verse 17. And lo, a voice from
[20:33] heaven saying, this is my beloved son in
[20:35] whom I'm well pleased. Brother Ram said
[20:38] if you get the uh the diglat digglot
[20:41] it'll say I'm well pleased to dwell in.
[20:43] Now I don't have I don't have it here. I
[20:44] got it at home but I don't know if
[20:46] that's right or not. He might have got
[20:48] his books confused but we're just making
[20:50] a point there. Right. We're making a
[20:52] point um that people can have beliefs
[20:55] and they can hold it for a long time.
[20:58] Right? We didn't have everything uh
[21:00] figured out when we first came in the
[21:01] message did we? Like I heard myself,
[21:04] remember last year I shared that quote
[21:06] uh or I shared that story. I was
[21:07] listening to brother uh a brother preach
[21:09] and and the brother said, "St. Paul
[21:11] couldn't handle living in today's uh
[21:13] world. He wouldn't be strong enough.
[21:15] Only you could handle." And I I heard my
[21:17] voice on the tape say, "Amen, brother."
[21:20] Well, now I don't believe
[21:21] that. Now here we are 20ome years later.
[21:24] I don't believe that. I believe Paul
[21:25] could have lived in any day because he
[21:28] was a child of God, right? And he gave
[21:30] his life. He was beheaded for the gospel
[21:33] of Jesus
[21:34] Christ. But God just allowed him to live
[21:37] in that age, the age of the line
[21:40] anointing. And the church said, "But the
[21:41] man said, don't you forget all the days
[21:43] of your life. Those beasts are thus
[21:45] sayeth the Lord. Don't you ever forget
[21:46] them." So we're living with the eagle
[21:48] anointing, the prophetic anointing to
[21:50] watch and pray. Hallelujah. To rise
[21:53] above the world. Okay. So that's the
[21:55] good a good example there that you can
[21:57] plainly see how God doesn't tell his
[21:59] prophets everything. I think it was 13
[22:01] years that Jacob didn't know Joseph was
[22:04] alive. And God never told him. He let
[22:07] him weep it out, cry it out, pout it out
[22:10] all those years, "My son's dead. My
[22:11] son's dead." And the whole time he's
[22:14] becoming a great man in Egypt because
[22:16] God doesn't tell his prophets
[22:18] everything. Nathan's like, "David, do
[22:20] all that's in your
[22:22] heart." God's like, "Go back and tell
[22:24] him, no, you're not going to build the
[22:25] house of God." What an embarrassment. I
[22:28] just told him to do everything he wants.
[22:31] No, you're not going to do everything
[22:32] you want. I got to go. I got to go
[22:34] correct the king. When you got thus
[22:36] sayith the Lord, you do. Hallelujah. So,
[22:38] see, God doesn't tell his prophets
[22:42] everything. All right. Now, I'm going to
[22:44] briefly again uh review uh those eight
[22:47] points, the eight problems with the
[22:48] trinity. They add to the Bible. The
[22:51] Trinity dogma adds to the Bible. Second,
[22:54] Jesus and apostles taught and affirmed
[22:56] pure Hebrew monotheism rather than
[23:00] trinitarianism. Right? Jesus quotes
[23:02] Deuteronomy 6. Here, O Israel, the
[23:04] sheima, the Lord our God is one Lord. He
[23:06] never quote, he never creates anything
[23:08] about three
[23:09] persons. Okay? Third, the Aanian creed
[23:12] has at least six contradictions,
[23:14] multiple contra contradictions.
[23:17] Fourth, there's Mabel, I'm sorry,
[23:19] there's major Bible contradictions and
[23:21] inconsistencies between
[23:23] Trinitarianism, between
[23:26] Trinitarians, right? So, like this
[23:28] brother I'm talking to, the reformed
[23:29] brother, he seems pretty close to the
[23:31] Bible, right? When I talked to him, I
[23:33] was like, he's pretty close other than
[23:34] that three persons part. And friends, I
[23:36] got a quote. Brother says, "All
[23:38] Trinitarians really believe the same
[23:40] thing anyway. It's the devil just
[23:41] getting in there making them think
[23:43] they're better than each other.
[23:46] That's true for some trinitarians, but
[23:48] not all of
[23:50] them,
[23:52] right? Okay. So, they don't have any
[23:54] they don't have any unity even amongst
[23:56] themselves. Fifth, uh the in early
[23:58] trinitarians didn't affirm the Holy
[24:00] Ghost was divine until 381 AD at the
[24:03] council of
[24:04] Constantinople. Six, trinitarian images
[24:07] like this false image are deceptive,
[24:09] creating false representations of the
[24:11] godhead. Seven. Some trinitarians use
[24:13] two fear tactics to persuade others to
[24:15] believe in the trinity. They call you
[24:17] heretic or you they say you're going to
[24:19] hell. And I wrote my book, Why would God
[24:22] send someone to hell who would only
[24:24] believe the Bible and wouldn't add to
[24:26] the
[24:27] Bible? You It's the opposite. God will
[24:30] take you to heaven because you don't add
[24:31] to the word of God. That's according to
[24:33] Revelation 22 18 and 19. So I'm doing
[24:36] some teaching tonight. So hope it's a
[24:38] blessing here.
[24:39] And then eighth, God sent a prophet with
[24:41] thus sayeth the Lord. Uh, trinitarianism
[24:44] is of the devil because we see what it's
[24:46] produced. Look what it's produced in the
[24:48] Roman Catholic
[24:49] Church. Okay, so we got a good
[24:52] background there on the review.
[24:54] Um, now let's start. I'm going to get on
[24:57] some quotes here. I got I got uh Oh,
[24:58] yeah. Plenty of time. Good. I got 33
[25:02] minutes here still left on my hour by
[25:03] God's grace.
[25:06] Okay. So, uh again I got about 22 quotes
[25:09] uh where brother Ram supports the
[25:11] trinity even publicly even in his home
[25:13] church until he starts changing his
[25:16] understanding of it. But again I was and
[25:19] I told this this kind person I said I
[25:21] might preach on it on Wednesday. Uh
[25:23] because the person said well I've been
[25:24] listening to uh brother Ram's sermon
[25:27] starting at the beginning going through
[25:28] and and brother Ram never believed in
[25:30] the trinity. And I was like well I'm
[25:31] pretty sure he did. Let me go back and
[25:35] look. Uh, and of course I went back and
[25:37] looked and I found that he did. Yeah, of
[25:40] course. So, um, but I want to I told
[25:43] that individual I would preach on it in
[25:44] a very kind way. So, I want to be very
[25:46] kind tonight by God's grace and just uh
[25:48] agree to disagree. I believe Brother Ram
[25:51] did believe in the Trinity and then
[25:52] later God showed him it's a trinity of
[25:54] manifestations, but it's just better not
[25:56] to use the word trinity at all. Praise
[25:58] God. Okay. You could though, you could
[26:00] say a trinity of manifestation. That's
[26:01] what I told my
[26:03] friend. But I just don't like the word
[26:05] because look what it leads to. Look what
[26:06] it has produced, right? Look at the
[26:08] Roman Catholic Church
[26:11] today. All right. The first quote where
[26:14] brother supports the Trinity in
[26:16] 1950. Okay. So he's uh he's already been
[26:19] pastoring 17
[26:21] years. 17 years. The first time on tape.
[26:24] He goes, "Our God came down, that third
[26:26] person yonder, into the flesh again and
[26:29] lives tonight in his people." Brother
[26:31] Amtt gives it a
[26:36] hallelujah. He gives it not an amen, a
[26:39] hallelujah. I've got other quotes you'll
[26:42] see. He'll talk about the third person.
[26:43] He'll say, "Is that
[26:45] right?" Now, my our dear my dear friend
[26:49] said, "Brother Bam was just saying that
[26:50] to try to win over the audience." To me,
[26:52] that that would be brother Ram being
[26:53] deceptive.
[26:55] And I don't believe Brother Ram was
[26:56] trying to deceive the people.
[26:59] Okay. Now, what I do believe is that
[27:01] Brother Ram understood this doctrine
[27:03] doesn't apply to salvation unless you
[27:05] worship three persons. Then you're lost,
[27:08] right? Because you're an
[27:10] idoltor, right? And you don't know the
[27:12] true
[27:14] God. Okay. Next quote is in uh
[27:18] 1951. Uh this is Janu
[27:21] July. He's in Erie, Pennsylvania. The
[27:24] first one is Little Rock, Arkansas. The
[27:26] next one
[27:27] is he's
[27:29] praying. He says, "And we've chosen
[27:31] these few words to read from thine. And
[27:33] may the Holy Spirit, the third person of
[27:35] the Trinity, come now. Come in now. The
[27:37] promise, the comforter that you said you
[27:40] would send, and he would take the things
[27:42] of God, pardon me, and would show them
[27:44] unto us."
[27:46] Okay. So, he's praying. May the third
[27:48] person come and show us what's in the
[27:51] word of
[27:53] God. Next quote uh from the very same
[27:58] sermon. He said, "Let me give you a
[28:00] small picture of what I think God is,
[28:02] what the trinity of God is. There's
[28:04] different arguments in the world
[28:06] concerning the trinity of the Godhead.
[28:08] All them believe the same thing, but the
[28:09] devils just got between them and got
[28:11] them all broke up. That's all."
[28:14] So, brother thought they all just
[28:16] believe the same thing and the devil got
[28:17] in there. But really, I'm sure he found
[28:19] out later there's lots of different
[28:20] kinds of
[28:22] trinitarianism. I just want you to see
[28:24] this. Brother said, "God is just like
[28:25] the air. He fills all the universe."
[28:28] Now, that's not what he says later. Did
[28:31] anybody pick that up? Later, he says
[28:34] even uh six years later, he says, "God
[28:36] is not just like the air, but he's in a
[28:39] body."
[28:40] I think it's called pantheism where you
[28:43] they believe God is in the tree, right?
[28:44] They believe God is in the any living
[28:46] thing. God's right in there, right? So,
[28:49] Brother Bam, brother Bam makes this
[28:50] statement. I'm not saying he had this
[28:51] pantheistic idea, but he makes this
[28:53] statement and he corrects it later. He
[28:55] says, "God is not like the air. God
[28:57] lives in a spiritual body." Right? God
[29:00] has a
[29:02] body. All right. Next one. Uh September
[29:06] 51. So two months
[29:07] later, he said, "Then then suffered
[29:10] under Pontius Pilate, crucified, buried,
[29:12] rose the third day, sitting at the right
[29:15] hand of God the Father, making
[29:16] intercessions now. For we who've
[29:18] accepted the Holy Spirit, the third
[29:20] person of the Trinity, and in our hearts
[29:22] tonight, he rules and reigns." The third
[29:25] person of the Trinity rules and reigns
[29:27] in our
[29:29] hearts. And he has said, "Whatsoever
[29:31] things you desire when you pray, believe
[29:32] when you receive them, you shall have
[29:34] them." We believe it.
[29:36] So he's saying we believe the third
[29:38] person rules and reigns in our hearts.
[29:40] That's what I emailed Joseph Random. I
[29:42] now I didn't I didn't have his is his
[29:44] his email address. I sent it to the
[29:45] voice of God. I said could you please
[29:47] ask Joseph if he believes a third person
[29:50] burns in your heart. Burns in his heart.
[29:53] And you know what his reply was? It was
[29:54] like two sentences. I believe uh the the
[29:57] tapes and the uh the tapes is the
[29:59] revelation of Jesus Christ. Hebrews
[30:01] 13:8. So he basically gave a non-answer
[30:05] but he answered by saying yes I believe
[30:07] everything on the tapes. So I think
[30:09] brother's son believes the third person
[30:11] burns in his
[30:12] heart. Well then you'd have to reject
[30:14] other quotes to accept
[30:18] that. Here it is. Here's the I believe.
[30:20] So nobody can tell me brother didn't
[30:22] believe in the trinity. Listen to this.
[30:24] I believe that he returned back in the
[30:25] form of the Holy Ghost. the second third
[30:28] person of the trinity come back as the
[30:30] comforter and is with us working the
[30:32] same thing that Jesus Christ did when he
[30:34] was here on earth. Now that's either
[30:36] right or wrong. Now that's the way you
[30:38] got to take
[30:39] God. He said I
[30:46] believe and who's been keeping track.
[30:48] We're going to get up past 22. I I
[30:50] haven't been. Hopefully somebody out
[30:51] there been Well, I should have told you
[30:52] to keep track. So let me go back up.
[30:55] Let's start keeping track. Who wants to
[30:56] keep track? Somebody raise your hand.
[30:57] Okay. All right. Virtue Haven. Victoria,
[30:59] keep track. Okay. So, I got uh right
[31:03] one, God and his people, Little Rock.
[31:06] Two, the resurrection of Lazarus, Erie,
[31:08] Pennsylvania.
[31:10] Uh
[31:11] three, resurrection of Lazarus, same
[31:15] quote. Four, hopes in God, third person
[31:18] ruling and reigning our hearts. And
[31:19] five, okay, we've done five, so put five
[31:21] tallies on there. Okay, here's number
[31:23] six. This is the one where brother says
[31:25] he loves the third
[31:26] person. Think about that. He's like,
[31:28] "Oh, I just love this third
[31:30] person." See, but he grew. The prophet
[31:33] can grow in understanding. So, this is
[31:35] number six. Truly, we're not much of
[31:37] this world. He's praying. We've looked
[31:40] uh we're looked down upon, but God, we
[31:41] believe, we're accepted in Christ Jesus,
[31:43] and in return has given us the Holy
[31:45] Ghost. We love him. That great third
[31:47] person of the Trinity who burns through
[31:49] our hearts and we love him. Oh, Holy
[31:53] Spirit, I thank you for your divine
[31:54] leading and how you led me here to
[31:56] Hammond,
[31:57] Indiana. We love him. I believe in him.
[32:01] I love him. Did Brother Anne believe in
[32:03] the
[32:04] Trinity? That's six. Here's number
[32:06] seven. I might as well just type it on
[32:08] here, too, then. I
[32:10] know. God testifying of his gifts. He
[32:14] says, ' Then Jesus Christ comes into his
[32:15] church into his people to manifest
[32:17] himself out through the people while he
[32:19] himself is sitting at the right hand of
[32:21] the father sending back the holy spirit
[32:24] the third person of the trinity to live
[32:26] in human beings to work through them to
[32:28] show the same works he did in the
[32:29] beginning making him yes the same
[32:31] yesterday today and forever is that
[32:33] right and everybody says amen they don't
[32:37] say no brother no that's wrong no no
[32:40] no number
[32:42] eight Who's believed our report?
[32:44] Hammond,
[32:46] Indiana. How many believes that? Well,
[32:48] that Holy Spirit is the Holy Spirit of
[32:50] God. Is that right? The third person of
[32:52] the Trinity, Jesus Christ. He calls
[32:54] Jesus Christ the third person of the
[32:56] Trinity. And then he he quotes Jesus
[32:58] again from the book of John. And then he
[33:01] says, "Then if he's going to be with us
[33:03] in us to the end of the world, that
[33:04] makes him the same yesterday, today, and
[33:06] forever." Is that
[33:08] right? There's
[33:11] eight. All right. Nine. Here's the first
[33:14] time first time he he talks about it
[33:16] positively that I can find in the home
[33:18] church in Jeffersonville, Indiana. This
[33:21] is number nine.
[33:22] Witnesses. He's praying. He's at the
[33:24] beginning. May the Holy Spirit, the
[33:26] third person of the Trinity, come take
[33:28] the word of God and place it into every
[33:30] heart just as it has need
[33:33] of. Let the third person come and place
[33:36] it into your
[33:39] heart. Oh my. Then he says, "We love you
[33:42] in the name of thy beloved son." Amen.
[33:45] Okay, here's number
[33:47] 10, June
[33:53] 1953. He says, "And he put his
[33:55] supernatural being, which was called
[33:56] man, the third person of the Trinity,
[33:58] Holy Spirit, into mankind." That's
[34:00] exactly right. He says, "That's exactly
[34:03] right. Not exactly wrong. That's exactly
[34:07] right." Number 11, the third person of
[34:10] the Trinity. listen is moving all over
[34:12] the building. We say it's the Holy
[34:14] Ghost. Brother Brandham said this was a
[34:15] third person of the
[34:17] Trinity. Oh my. All over the building.
[34:19] Oh. Oh, I just have to say this. There's
[34:22] two or three dozen raised hands. God's
[34:24] provided sacrifices here. God's Holy
[34:26] Spirit, the third person, the Trinity,
[34:27] the Holy Ghost is now moving over the
[34:29] building. What made you raise your hand,
[34:31] sinner? He's even uh giving credit to
[34:34] the third person for sinners getting
[34:36] saved.
[34:41] Okay. So, now we come to the Now, don't
[34:45] don't write this one down. This is this
[34:47] is negative here. Here, this is So,
[34:48] we're still on
[34:50] 11, but we're going to get to 12 in a
[34:52] little bit. So, here's the first time he
[34:54] has a negative comment about the Trinity
[34:56] that I can find. It's Sim I think it's
[34:58] Simon's birthday. That'd be very uh very
[35:00] applicable. It' be very uh meaningful.
[35:04] July 29th, 1953. Now, of course, Simon
[35:06] wasn't born till 77.
[35:10] Brother man said, "Now there's been
[35:11] three dispensations. The fatherhood, the
[35:13] sunship, and the Holy Spirit
[35:14] dispensation." See what I mean? We don't
[35:16] say our gods. That's heathen. And the
[35:18] Jew knows that. But when you can make it
[35:21] to him that this Jesus is God, Jehovah
[35:23] God, not a second or a third person.
[35:26] It's the same person all the time making
[35:29] himself
[35:31] manifest. Now look, he doesn't say it
[35:33] negatively like it's of the devil. He
[35:35] just said it's not a second or third
[35:37] person the first time. This is 20 years
[35:42] since he's been
[35:43] pastoring. I hope most of my beliefs say
[35:46] the same. But if God wants to correct me
[35:48] on something, he's more than welcome
[35:50] to. Hallelujah. And here church, this is
[35:53] one thing I've never find brother
[35:55] apologized for being a
[35:56] trinitarianism. So think about that. See
[35:59] church that if things don't pertain to
[36:00] salvation and doesn't hurt anybody, you
[36:02] don't have to apologize for it. You just
[36:04] have to recognize, well, I grew. God
[36:07] gave me greater revelation.
[36:10] That's one thing I found about brother
[36:11] Ram. Rarely does he ever apologize for
[36:13] times where he he grew in understanding.
[36:15] He even called the white horse rider the
[36:18] Holy Ghost and it turned out to be the
[36:20] devil or the antichrist spirit. And he
[36:22] never apologized about that. Church,
[36:24] that shows how merciful God is. Yes, you
[36:27] recognize your wrongs, but God is not
[36:29] going to hold it against you. As I
[36:30] showed our brother, who shall lay any
[36:32] charge to God's elect? Amen. What a
[36:35] friend we have in Jesus. Hallelujah.
[36:37] Okay. Number
[36:40] 12. Four months later, he's in Indiana
[36:43] at a different church and he says God
[36:46] sent back the third person to the
[36:49] church. He said he's sitting by the
[36:51] father and he sent the holy spirit back,
[36:54] the third person, the trinity, to bear
[36:56] record of his being. Okay. number 13,
[37:01] December 1953 in public uh in Chicago,
[37:05] Illinois. And he cleansed us from our
[37:07] sins that God himself might come in the
[37:09] third person now and live in the human
[37:12] heart. Okay. Number 14, April 1954.
[37:16] Still positive to the public about the
[37:18] third person. Now, there does come a
[37:20] point where it seems like he's no longer
[37:22] positive about the Trinity, but guess
[37:24] what? It's after the seals are
[37:26] open.
[37:29] Number 14. Now, Father, he's praying in
[37:33] uh Kentucky, Louisville, Kentucky. Take
[37:35] the word and may the Holy Spirit, the
[37:36] third person of the Trinity comes, take
[37:38] the word of God and break it out to the
[37:40] people and put it every in every heart
[37:42] where it has need where God would send
[37:45] it. We ask it in Jesus' name.
[37:48] Amen. All right. Number 15 in New York.
[37:51] He still supports the third person of
[37:52] the Trinity.
[37:55] Now tonight, Jesus Christ has risen from
[37:57] the dead and is living right here among
[37:59] us in spirit form called the Holy
[38:01] Spirit, the Holy Spirit of God, which is
[38:03] Jesus Christ the third person of the
[38:05] Trinity. Yet trinitarians will say he's
[38:07] the second person of the Trinity. The
[38:09] Ram said Jesus is the third person of
[38:11] the
[38:14] Trinity. Number
[38:16] 16. Uh I'm sorry, no, don't count this
[38:19] one. Nope. This is a back in his home
[38:22] church in October 54. He said there's no
[38:25] third person, so don't count this one.
[38:26] Oh, it looks like I got some of these
[38:28] counted.
[38:30] Okay. I said
[38:34] uh I said he wasn't no third person or
[38:37] second person. He was the same person
[38:39] made flesh in order to take away our
[38:41] sins. He had to come and make a
[38:44] sacrifice. So there he got it right
[38:46] again or he's growing there. All right.
[38:48] Now it's number 16. Everybody write that
[38:50] one down. This is in uh Sou Falls, South
[38:53] Dakota. And the Lord Jesus, he's in the
[38:56] form of the Holy Ghost, the third
[38:58] person, is here tonight in his
[39:00] resurrection doing the same thing in his
[39:02] church that he did when he was here to
[39:05] carry on the work of the to the last
[39:07] enemy which is put under his
[39:09] feet. Now, what Brother Ram's accusers
[39:13] church will say is that brother Ram just
[39:15] changed his doctrine when he was in a
[39:17] church that had different beliefs.
[39:19] They try to attack his
[39:22] character. But to me, Brother Bam
[39:24] realizes, as the coach will show, he
[39:26] realizes Trinity doesn't pertain to
[39:27] salvation. So, he's just being kind and
[39:30] respecting their beliefs. But he's
[39:32] starting to realize now, I don't believe
[39:34] in three persons, but he knows he's
[39:36] going into a trinitarian church. And so,
[39:39] he just preaches that there's three
[39:41] persons.
[39:43] Okay? That's what I can see.
[39:47] Just like if I if I didn't believe
[39:48] something was uh just like when I
[39:50] preached at the Baptist church a few
[39:52] times, right? What did I do? I I just I
[39:55] I changed the message a little bit and I
[39:57] didn't come out and blast their
[39:59] beliefs, right? But I laid the truth in
[40:03] there about the three works of
[40:04] grace, but I know they don't believe in
[40:06] the three works of grace, but I try to
[40:08] say it a simple way where they might be
[40:10] able to catch the
[40:12] revelation. I wonder since then, they
[40:14] haven't had me back. I wonder if I
[40:15] stepped on their toes with just
[40:17] something small like that. That's okay.
[40:18] That's fine with me. If the if the word
[40:20] of God hurt your toes, well then that's
[40:22] then let it hurt your toes. Praise God.
[40:24] Right. Can't get mad about
[40:27] that. Number 17 in February uh 1958
[40:31] still supporting the Trinity in South
[40:34] Ben,
[40:36] Indiana. So the one that has been among
[40:38] us died and rose again in glor is
[40:40] glorified in the presence of God tonight
[40:42] comes back in the form of the third
[40:44] person. the the Trinity, the Holy Spirit
[40:46] dwells in us and moves and proves
[40:48] himself to be the same Lord Jesus.
[40:51] Number 18 now in Harrisburg, Virginia.
[40:54] Let him open your eyes. He's the Holy
[40:56] Spirit, the third person of the Trinity
[40:57] here tonight to grease up your eyes with
[41:00] God's
[41:01] salve. So the dove is going to third
[41:04] person is going to give you grease for
[41:05] your
[41:08] eyes. Okay. Now, here's a quite a
[41:11] statement. This is number 19, right?
[41:12] Number 19. This is in his home church,
[41:15] but notice here's where he used trinity
[41:18] in a positive way. Look what brother Ram
[41:21] says. I don't say this to hurt. I'm a
[41:24] trinitarian,
[41:26] too. Wait, wait. Did I read that right?
[41:28] Yeah, I did. Brother Ram said, I'm a
[41:32] trinitarian, too. I believe in the
[41:34] Trinity, the three attributes of God the
[41:37] Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but not
[41:40] three gods.
[41:43] Okay. So, I got a quote where brother
[41:45] says, "I'm a trinitarian, too." And
[41:49] people people might say he was never a
[41:50] trinitarian. Well, it depends what how
[41:52] you define it. But I just showed you
[41:54] where he said, "I believe in the third
[41:55] person, and we love the third person
[41:57] who's in our
[42:00] hearts." That's number
[42:03] 19. Okay. Number
[42:06] 20. What it takes to overcome uh
[42:09] Washington. Now remember the Jesus I'm
[42:11] talking about is the third person which
[42:13] is the Holy Spirit which is in us God in
[42:18] us. Okay. All right. Now the next one is
[42:21] doesn't count. So don't don't do a tally
[42:23] mark. He's in his home church. The
[42:24] kinsman redeemer October 1960. I differ
[42:28] with Billy Graham on three individual
[42:30] persons in the godhead. He's in his home
[42:31] church or any other trinitarian teacher
[42:34] on that. I believe in a trinity of
[42:35] course but not in that manner them being
[42:38] three persons. They're one
[42:40] person. They're one person. See the
[42:43] plural? They're there. The
[42:45] manifestations are one
[42:47] person. Okay. Number 21. November 1960
[42:50] is in Louisiana.
[42:57] He says Jesus Christ, the resurrected
[42:59] one, the one you call the third person
[43:02] is the same person that's in our midst
[43:05] now working in our flesh as God worked
[43:08] in the flesh of his own son Jesus Christ
[43:11] is working the flesh of adopted children
[43:13] through Jesus Christ as he promised.
[43:16] Brother Ram said the third person is in
[43:18] our midst now. And before he said he
[43:21] doesn't even believe in the third
[43:23] person. So what is he doing? He's he's
[43:26] letting them believe what they want
[43:27] because it's a minor. It's not a major
[43:30] church. I've I did a search last week
[43:32] too. I've done all the major and minor
[43:34] quotes. And brother Bam only says the
[43:37] major doctrine is what?
[43:39] Salvation. Everything else he says is
[43:42] minor. Communion. Remember I I shared
[43:44] that on Wednesday. Communion is a minor.
[43:46] It doesn't pertain to salvation. If you
[43:48] take communion or don't, it doesn't save
[43:50] you. What saves you is faith in the
[43:52] blood of Jesus Christ.
[43:55] Hallelujah. Saved by grace. Brother said
[43:58] gifts don't save you. Tongues,
[44:00] interpretation,
[44:01] prophecy. He said blood in your hand
[44:03] doesn't save you. All these things,
[44:06] being a preacher doesn't save you. What
[44:09] saves you is faith in the blood of
[44:11] Christ. Hallelujah.
[44:13] There's
[44:16] 21. Now, Brother Ram says, "No, now he's
[44:19] taking it up a little notch
[44:21] here." And this this is not 22. This is
[44:24] uh against
[44:25] it. He's talking about uh
[44:32] trinitarians. Okay, now I lost my spot.
[44:34] Okay, you say, "Well, now he's the third
[44:36] person or the second person." You ain't
[44:39] got no seal yet, so just leave it alone.
[44:43] See, you're done off the paper there. So
[44:44] then there's no such thing as that in
[44:46] the Bible. We bless the trin the holy
[44:48] trinity. You're not even on the paper
[44:50] now because there's no such thing as
[44:51] trinity ever mentioned in the Bible. So
[44:54] now he finally starts during the right
[44:55] after the church age. Was that the
[44:58] that's Yeah. Right. Right before the
[44:59] church age series. Now he starts making
[45:02] a distinction. People that call God
[45:03] three gods and three persons. He said,
[45:05] "You're not even sealed yet. You're not
[45:07] born again. You're not baptized with the
[45:09] Holy Ghost." Okay? Okay. So, he starts
[45:11] making a distinction there in his home
[45:16] church. Okay. Uh let's
[45:19] see. Three months after that, here's
[45:21] number 22. Put a tally. I'm going to
[45:23] count with you now. Abraham in Long
[45:25] Beach, California. See that? Then that
[45:28] same word, Christ, the promise, the Holy
[45:30] Ghost. You call the third person of the
[45:31] Trinity. That's fine. He
[45:34] says, he just said, you can't you're not
[45:36] sealed if you believe if you believe in
[45:38] it. And he says that's fine. You call
[45:40] him the third person of the
[45:41] Trinity. See, he's letting them believe
[45:44] what they want. Church, don't you know
[45:46] brother preached in Amy Simple
[45:47] McFersonson's church after she died.
[45:50] She'd been married two times, but she
[45:52] believed in divine healing and the Holy
[45:54] Ghost and tongues. And Brother preached
[45:56] at a former woman's
[46:01] church. That's a stinger, isn't it? The
[46:04] prophet of God. It's called the
[46:06] Fourquare Gospel Church.
[46:09] I think it was called Angelus Temple if
[46:11] I'm not mistaken. I have to look that
[46:12] one up. It's one of the biggest
[46:14] churches. She had one of the first mega
[46:17] churches that now that causes some
[46:20] people to stumble, but not me because I
[46:22] can see what he's doing. He's just
[46:24] trying to cast the net out. He's just
[46:26] taking every invitation to try to catch
[46:28] this the predestinated seed.
[46:32] Hallelujah. Look where God found me. God
[46:34] found me in the chapel. a predestinated
[46:39] seed. Simon threw the net out, right? He
[46:42] threw the net in the chapel. Simon got
[46:44] me caught in the net by the grace of
[46:46] God.
[46:48] Hallelujah. See, so sometimes God will
[46:51] just he'll just allow somebody to go and
[46:53] it might seem
[46:54] strange, but allow uh brother Brandham
[46:57] to preach there in a former woman's
[46:58] church and pull out the elect. Also,
[47:02] it's also if none get pulled out, then
[47:04] it's a rebuke and witness against them
[47:06] that they rejected the truth. Or maybe
[47:09] it's a a wise virgin trying to help out
[47:11] a foolish version like Abraham helped
[47:13] out
[47:16] Lot. I'm almost done. Bear with me here.
[47:18] I know it's been a long week already. I
[47:20] know it's been a long week for me,
[47:22] too. Now, here's the first time. We're
[47:25] at 22,
[47:28] right? Here's the first time, Brother
[47:31] Ram says outside of his church that the
[47:33] Trinity is wrong. Guess when it was St.
[47:36] Patrick's Day. All right.
[47:42] 1961. It's in Middletown, Ohio. Glory,
[47:45] Ohio. So when he was descending from
[47:47] heaven, not another three people left
[47:50] down there talking, but they saw the
[47:51] spirit of God like a dove. That's who
[47:53] the spirit was. Not the third person
[47:56] talking. Not three gods but three
[47:58] offices of the same God. God the father
[48:00] and the pillar of fire. God the son or
[48:02] he even says God the son in human flesh.
[48:04] God the holy ghost in you. The same God.
[48:06] In the church age book. Brother says
[48:07] there is no God the
[48:09] son. Because son already means you had a
[48:12] beginning. And God had no beginning
[48:15] ever. Now I'm going to save my spot
[48:19] there. Let me read you the a little bit
[48:22] more on the thus sayith the Lord quotes.
[48:23] Uh I'm just going to read real briefly.
[48:27] The ram says, uh, thus sayith the Lord,
[48:30] trinitarianism is of the devil. Look
[48:32] where it came from, the council of Nika.
[48:34] Now, do you say then, do you believe all
[48:36] these trinitarians are of hell? No, sir.
[48:39] I believe they're
[48:41] Christians. But the hour is approaching,
[48:43] brother, when they're sincerely wrong.
[48:45] Brother Ram says, "Any any minister that
[48:48] wants to challenge me on that?" He said,
[48:49] "I'm waiting for you to give me a call
[48:51] on the phone, not text me." Okay.
[48:55] But the man said, "If you got scripture
[48:56] to support it, I'll be looking for you
[48:58] or listening for your call." And and all
[49:00] the people you I heard him preach it.
[49:02] They're all all the preachers are
[49:03] laughing. Nobody's going to call them
[49:05] because you don't have any scripture
[49:06] that says these three persons like those
[49:09] literal words,
[49:13] right? Now look, look, he says here. Now
[49:15] listen, look at listen quote. The same
[49:17] quote, the same quote. He says, "Thus
[49:19] sayith the Lord." Oh, he says it again.
[49:21] Remember I say this, thus sayith the
[49:22] Lord, if you believe me to be a
[49:24] servant. So twice he says trinitarianism
[49:27] of the devil. Thus sayith the Lord. And
[49:29] then twice he says they're
[49:31] saved. Listen this exact quote. I
[49:34] believe that many thousands. Everybody
[49:36] say thousands. Thousands of trinitarian
[49:39] people who believe in three gods is
[49:42] saved. He says three
[49:45] gods. That's what the quote says. Now he
[49:48] could have slipped. He could add a slip
[49:49] of the tongue. Maybe he met uh maybe he
[49:52] meant three persons, right? But there's
[49:55] no thus sayith the Lord around this one.
[49:57] See, because they don't know any
[49:58] difference. We're going to get to that
[50:00] down the message. So, see again this
[50:01] principle, God winks at the
[50:04] ignorance, right, of Martin Luther and
[50:07] John Wesley. Hallelujah. God winks at
[50:10] their ignorance. They just they didn't
[50:11] they they didn't know better. And
[50:13] brother Ram said, "Many thousands are
[50:15] saved even if they believe in three gods
[50:18] or we'll say three
[50:21] persons." How many enjoying this tonight
[50:23] by God's grace? I enjoyed going down
[50:25] through uh the history seeing how long
[50:28] it took God or how long God waited to
[50:31] reveal it to brother Bradom. It's really
[50:34] really quite striking. Okay, we're at
[50:38] 22.
[50:39] Okay. Okay. Now, don't don't put a
[50:42] tally, but uh in Chicago, Illinois, he
[50:44] says, "Somebody says, "Brother Bam, are
[50:45] you a trinitarian?" No, sir, I'm not a
[50:46] trinitarian. I'm a Christian. Remember a
[50:49] few last year, the year before, he said
[50:50] he was a
[50:51] trinitarian. But it depends if you mean
[50:53] three persons or three
[50:55] manifestations. Depends which one you
[51:01] mean. Okay, I think I'm at Am I at 22,
[51:04] girls? You got the tallies. Okay, so it
[51:06] looks like it is 22. Now, I do may have
[51:08] some more quotes.
[51:13] Okay. So, I think yeah, I think that
[51:16] might be it as far as my quotes. Let's
[51:17] see. Doesn't pertain to
[51:19] salvation. Okay. And then there's
[51:21] positive. Okay. Now, here's a positive
[51:24] one. Now,
[51:26] um yeah, this one doesn't say three
[51:28] persons, so I'm going to leave it at 22
[51:30] because here's uh back in Washington.
[51:33] Brother Ram said, "See, everything in
[51:34] the Bible is in a trinity. You know that
[51:36] you're in a trinity." Brother Ram says,
[51:38] "Soul, body, spirit. You're a
[51:41] trinity. See, closely related parts.
[51:44] Body, soul, spirit. Uh, nature, can you
[51:47] take out your spirit real quick so we
[51:48] can examine it? And uh, Haven, can you
[51:51] can you bring your soul up here so we
[51:53] can examine your soul and make sure it's
[51:54] sealed? No, you can't separate, right?
[51:57] You can't you can't. They're closely
[51:58] related parts. So, yes, you could use
[52:01] the word I'm a trinity of three
[52:04] parts, but I'm one person.
[52:08] Okay, so that's brother Ram using it in
[52:10] a positive way. And just so you know,
[52:12] this is what I love. Brother Ram was a
[52:14] trinitarian for over for about probably
[52:16] 20 years of preaching. But when he got
[52:18] baptized, something told him he's
[52:20] supposed to be baptized in the name of
[52:22] Jesus. Look at this quote. Brother says,
[52:25] "When I was just a boy, before I ever
[52:27] heard of oneness, twice, three gods,
[52:30] four gods, ever what they
[52:32] got, I believe there was one God, and I
[52:35] believe that his name was Jesus. And I
[52:37] was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[52:39] by a missionary Baptist preacher because
[52:42] I asked him to do it. I preached it ever
[52:45] since. So even even though he didn't
[52:47] know if God was two, three, four,
[52:49] whatever he was, he knew Jesus was God
[52:53] because he'd seen Jesus. That's right.
[52:54] That's right. Even as a little child.
[52:56] Yeah. He'd seen Jesus in the sage field
[52:58] one night.
[53:00] Hallelujah. And he woke up sweating.
[53:02] That's
[53:04] right. Okay. So there's
[53:07] 22 quotes by God's
[53:11] grace where he says uh three persons or
[53:14] trinity in a positive
[53:19] light. Remember he told trinitarians
[53:21] it's fine you believe the third
[53:23] person.
[53:25] Um and so he was very gracious. We see
[53:28] brother man being super gracious. Okay.
[53:31] Now let's read two more.
[53:33] Um don't count these. We're going to
[53:35] leave it at you don't have to do tallies
[53:36] anymore. Thank you. For some reason, I
[53:38] thought I had more. But here's another
[53:40] positive use of the word trinity uh in
[53:42] the last year of his life,
[53:43] 1965. But now the true trinity of God
[53:46] being one manifested in Christ who was
[53:50] life and have broke the seals and
[53:51] conquered the enemy and rose up the one
[53:53] true and living God. I am he that was
[53:55] dead and I'm alive forever more and have
[53:58] the keys of death and hell. God in one
[54:01] made man and dwelt among us and
[54:03] conquered every enemy and had proved
[54:06] that the trinity of Satan was conquered.
[54:08] How many knew that God has a trinity?
[54:11] Satan has a
[54:12] trinity and the trinity of God was made
[54:15] known because only God alone had power
[54:17] to bring back life again. He was
[54:20] Emanuel. God had been manifested in the
[54:23] flesh. Hallelujah. Now, I forget the
[54:25] trinity of saint. I'm have to go look it
[54:26] up. Brother teaches it in the seven
[54:28] seals. So, forgive me. I forget it's
[54:30] something like
[54:31] beast and something else might be beast
[54:35] false prophet might deal with the the
[54:36] the the antichrist but I forget what the
[54:39] trinity of Satan was. So I need to go
[54:40] look that
[54:41] up. So somebody asked me that on Sunday
[54:44] night. Okay, don't let me forget
[54:45] that because brother said Satan comes in
[54:48] a tr trinity. Now listen to this quote.
[54:50] Here's a quote where people Oh, I was
[54:52] asked this on the debate in 2020 and
[54:55] they were trying to show that uh brother
[54:56] Brandham they were trying to make some
[54:58] false accusation against brother
[55:00] Brandham. Brother Brandham was talking
[55:02] to a preacher and and uh the preacher
[55:05] said we refuse any revelations. Brother
[55:08] Brandham said then you have to re refuse
[55:10] Jesus Christ for he is the revelation of
[55:13] God revealed in the flesh. Unless you
[55:15] see it, you're lost. Now listen to this
[55:17] quote.
[55:19] anointed ones of the end time. Jesus
[55:21] said, "Except you believe that I am he,
[55:22] you'll die in your sins." He is the
[55:24] revelation of God, the spirit of God
[55:26] revealed in human form. If you can't
[55:28] believe that, you're lost. You put him a
[55:31] third person, second person, or any
[55:33] other person besides God, you're lost.
[55:35] He
[55:36] says, "Except you believe that I am he,
[55:39] you'll die in your sins." A
[55:41] revelation. Now, it depends how you
[55:43] interpret
[55:44] this, right?
[55:46] Uh because mo the trinitarians I know
[55:50] they believe Jesus is
[55:52] God. The trouble is they believe two
[55:54] other people are God. That's the
[55:56] trouble. But if they don't know better
[55:57] church, they don't know better. Because
[56:00] I was a trinitarian and I know nothing
[56:02] about it. I just well everybody else
[56:03] believes it. We just sing about it. We
[56:06] we didn't know nothing. We never studied
[56:08] the the textbooks. Now I bought
[56:10] textbooks so I know what I'm talking
[56:11] about now. They say co-equal,
[56:14] co-eternal, uh everything uh distinct,
[56:18] three separate, distinct individual
[56:20] persons. I mean some of them go farther
[56:22] than that where it's almost three
[56:25] gods. Okay. So the the on the debate
[56:28] they asked me about this but I said to
[56:30] me I said if you're take if you're
[56:31] interpreting it like that then this was
[56:33] just brother Ram's opinion because I
[56:34] have other quotes where he says
[56:35] trinitarians are
[56:37] saved and there's no thus sayith the
[56:40] Lord attached to this quote.
[56:43] But think about that church. If you you
[56:45] refuse the revelation that Jesus is
[56:47] Messiah or that Jesus is God, that's
[56:49] what the Messiah is, God. God in flesh.
[56:52] If you if you refuse that, you are
[56:55] lost, right? Because then Jesus isn't
[56:57] divine. He's not God. But there's
[57:00] ignorant trinitarians that believe he's
[57:02] God. They fully man, fully God, but then
[57:05] they believe two other people are fully
[57:07] God, too. But they do believe Jesus is
[57:10] God.
[57:12] So, see, it depends how you interpret
[57:14] some of these quotes. I think we can
[57:16] make them fit together by God's grace.
[57:18] We can see Brother Ram's growth. Praise
[57:19] God. We can see Brother Ram's grace on
[57:21] people that are ignorant and they just
[57:23] don't
[57:25] know.
[57:28] Right. All right. Uh, and knoweth it not
[57:30] four months before he passed away. 65.
[57:33] That's God. God in a trinity is one. And
[57:36] without a trinity, he's not God.
[57:40] He can't be manifested any other
[57:42] way. See, some people might stumble at
[57:44] that, but you have to understand trinity
[57:46] has more than one
[57:49] definition. He says, "And neither can
[57:51] you be manifested without being the
[57:53] trinity person that you are." So when
[57:56] you shake people's hands tonight, say,
[57:58] "Have a good night, Trinity
[58:00] person." Because Abraham said, "You're a
[58:02] trinity
[58:04] person." That's what he says. You're a
[58:06] trinity person.
[58:08] You're three closely related parts, but
[58:11] you're one
[58:13] person. He said, "Body, spirit, soul.
[58:16] Without either of them, you're not
[58:18] complete." See, if you didn't have a
[58:20] soul, you'd be nothing. If you didn't
[58:21] have a human spirit, you'd be nothing.
[58:22] If you didn't have a body, you just be a
[58:24] spirit, not a body. So, God is complete
[58:26] in the triunity of a being. Not, now
[58:29] listen, not triunity of beings. See the
[58:32] s the plural not beings but it's a
[58:35] triunityity of one
[58:39] being father son and holy ghost is one
[58:42] true manifested God. God he says
[58:49] hallelujah. All
[58:51] right. Now there's four quotes at least
[58:54] where salvation is the greatest thing.
[58:56] Brother Ram never says uh brother Ram
[58:58] never says the godhead is greater than
[58:59] salvation as far as un the understanding
[59:01] of it. Now brother Ram does call the
[59:04] godhead and water baptism major
[59:06] doctrines in the beginning of the church
[59:08] age book in the in in the
[59:10] introduction. Okay? So we we could say
[59:13] those are major doctrines. Okay? But
[59:16] when brother talks about majors and
[59:17] minors in his quotes, the only major is
[59:21] salvation. So here's what he says.
[59:26] Brother Ram said, "In our mind lays
[59:28] hundreds of things that you've done,
[59:29] God, and the greatest of all we can
[59:31] think of is when you saved us from a
[59:33] life of death, wherein us dwelt death
[59:36] before because of sin and trespasses."
[59:40] So, what's the greatest thing in your
[59:41] mind tonight? How great you are, how
[59:42] much money you make, how how tall, or
[59:44] how beautiful or how handsome you are.
[59:47] No, the greatest thing is that God gave
[59:49] us salvation. God gave us eternal life.
[59:53] Think about all the great things God has
[59:54] done. What's the greatest thing? Oh, I
[59:56] had this dream. I I felt shivers down my
[59:58] spine. I spoke in tongues. I prophesied.
[1:00:00] I preached the house down. All these
[1:00:02] people come to the altar. No. The
[1:00:03] greatest thing you could think of is
[1:00:04] that God saved me from death. God saved
[1:00:08] us from
[1:00:09] death. I'm doing pretty good on time,
[1:00:11] too. Uh when brother said told sister
[1:00:14] had right, just say whatever you want.
[1:00:16] What'd she say? The greatest desire in
[1:00:17] my heart is to understand the godhead.
[1:00:20] How about serpent seeds? Some of you
[1:00:21] might say
[1:00:22] that. How about the church ages? Oh, the
[1:00:25] seven seals. The greatest desire in my
[1:00:28] heart is my two teenage boys that they
[1:00:30] may be
[1:00:33] saved. Why? Because that's
[1:00:36] eternal. But said, I give them to you in
[1:00:39] the name of Jesus
[1:00:42] Christ. 1961 said, "Do you love him with
[1:00:46] all your heart? Isn't he wonderful? What
[1:00:47] could we do without him?" Now, just what
[1:00:49] could you do? Could you tell me anything
[1:00:51] that would be greater? If you can show
[1:00:53] me something greater than that, I'll
[1:00:54] sell out what I got and long for that
[1:00:57] that you show me that's greater than
[1:00:59] this. Yes, sir. The greatest thing that
[1:01:01] I know of to know with the assurance
[1:01:04] that we are saved.
[1:01:06] To know that the very God that made
[1:01:08] heavens and earth would humble himself
[1:01:10] and come down and dwell amongst us and
[1:01:12] die for
[1:01:16] us. The greatest thing I know of is
[1:01:18] blessed assurance. Jesus is mine. Oh,
[1:01:21] what a foretaste of glory
[1:01:23] divine. And brother Ram says in 1963,
[1:01:27] perseverance, God has done something for
[1:01:29] you. He saved you. That's the greatest
[1:01:32] miracle there
[1:01:34] is.
[1:01:38] Amen.
[1:01:43] Okay. Now, if we can look here, let's go
[1:01:45] to Revelation one here. Let's go to
[1:01:47] Revelation.
[1:01:52] I'm closing with this. I'm at my hour. I
[1:01:54] got 25 seconds till my
[1:01:59] hours. Revelation
[1:02:13] 1. Brother Brandham reads uh verse 8 and
[1:02:16] verse 11. I'll I'll uh close that down.
[1:02:19] That old heathenist or heathen picture
[1:02:21] there, that heretical picture there. You
[1:02:24] had to stare at it all service, but you
[1:02:25] didn't have to. But I want you to
[1:02:28] understand how many understand better by
[1:02:30] God's grace.
[1:02:32] Amen. Revelation 18. I am the Alpha and
[1:02:35] the Omega, the beginning and the ending,
[1:02:38] sayeth the Lord, which is, look at this
[1:02:40] verse, which is, which was and which is
[1:02:44] to come, the
[1:02:48] Almighty. Who says that second
[1:02:52] person? No. So the Almighty said that
[1:02:55] verse
[1:02:56] 111 saying I am the alpha and omega and
[1:02:59] the first and the last and what thou
[1:03:02] seeest write in a book and send it unto
[1:03:04] the seven churches which are in Asia and
[1:03:06] so forth. Now I'm closing with this
[1:03:08] because brother uses this in chapter one
[1:03:10] in case you just read it recently
[1:03:12] chapter one of the re uh the church age
[1:03:14] book.
[1:03:17] He said, "Trinitarians, they know
[1:03:18] there's one God according to scripture,
[1:03:20] but they try to make it a fantastic
[1:03:22] theory that God is like a bunch of
[1:03:24] grapes, three persons with the same
[1:03:27] divinity shared equally by all." But it
[1:03:30] plainly says here that Jesus is that
[1:03:33] which is, that which was, and that which
[1:03:36] is to come. He is the alpha and omega,
[1:03:40] which means he is the A to Z or the all
[1:03:43] of it. He's all of it
[1:03:46] because it's God manifested in flesh. He
[1:03:49] be Emmanuel, God with us. He's called
[1:03:52] the mighty God. The e the son is called
[1:03:55] the everlasting father because it's the
[1:03:58] father's
[1:04:00] body. He's everything. Brother said he's
[1:04:02] the almighty. He's the rose of Sharon,
[1:04:04] the lily, the valley, the bright and
[1:04:06] morning star, the righteous branch, the
[1:04:08] father, the son, the holy ghost. He is
[1:04:10] God almighty, one God.
[1:04:14] Hallelujah. He was one God manifest in
[1:04:17] the flesh. That ought to settle it. So 1
[1:04:20] Timothy 3:16 ought to settle it for
[1:04:23] trinitarians. It's not a second God or
[1:04:26] second person. It's God manifest in the
[1:04:29] flesh. See church, that's what brother
[1:04:31] Bam taught us. Never leave that
[1:04:34] word. Never get out of that word.
[1:04:40] God came in a human form. That didn't
[1:04:42] make him another God. He was God. The
[1:04:45] same God. It It was a revelation then
[1:04:49] and it's a revelation now. One God.
[1:04:52] Let's stand to our feet. You've been a
[1:04:54] good audience tonight. There's my hour.
[1:04:56] Praise God. It's 8 o'clock. Can anybody
[1:04:57] believe it here tonight? Hallelujah.
[1:05:00] Musicians can
[1:05:02] come. I hope that was a help to you by
[1:05:05] God's grace church. I I thoroughly
[1:05:07] enjoyed that. Again, I was in a kind
[1:05:08] way. I was kind of challenged and I just
[1:05:10] thought, well, let me go look that up
[1:05:11] again. I I felt for sure over the years,
[1:05:14] I'd heard brother random say he believed
[1:05:15] that God was uh a trinity persons and so
[1:05:20] forth. And so I got you 22 quotes. 22
[1:05:23] quotes. That's not just like one or two.
[1:05:27] And it spans from uh 1950 all the way I
[1:05:31] think it was up
[1:05:32] to I have to look I I think it was 61 if
[1:05:35] I'm not mistaken where he said that's
[1:05:37] fine. It's fine if you believe God is
[1:05:39] three
[1:05:40] persons. Now for us church, it's not
[1:05:43] fine for us because we have the
[1:05:44] revelation. Praise God. We know who God
[1:05:47] is. God is Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. God
[1:05:50] became flesh in his son Jesus Christ.
[1:05:53] Praise God. So I think, you know, on a
[1:05:55] service like this, it's good to close in
[1:05:57] prayer here where we could uh pray. You
[1:06:00] know, if you don't understand the
[1:06:01] Godhead, just give it some time, right?
[1:06:03] Because the Bible says, "Grow in grace
[1:06:05] and the knowledge of the Lord.
[1:06:07] And here's what I told that preacher. I
[1:06:08] said, I said, "Preacher, start with
[1:06:10] three and I'll bring you down to
[1:06:14] one." The Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost and
[1:06:17] the Father were the same spirit because
[1:06:20] or else Jesus had two dads. Now I
[1:06:21] brought you down to two. And then I said
[1:06:24] Jesus said, "I am that I am." Before
[1:06:26] Abraham was, I am. I said, "Now I
[1:06:28] brought your two down to
[1:06:30] one." Now I didn't say this, but I
[1:06:32] should have said, "If you believe God
[1:06:33] was two persons, I'd have more respect
[1:06:35] for you.
[1:06:37] I have I'd have a third more
[1:06:39] respect. And the church
[1:06:42] said because right now I have twothirds
[1:06:44] less respect for
[1:06:46] him, right? But again, I maybe I
[1:06:49] shouldn't say that. Maybe that that's a
[1:06:50] joke. Let let me make that a joke
[1:06:52] because church, if God doesn't ordain
[1:06:54] your eyes to see it, you're not going to
[1:06:55] see it. Because this is all by what?
[1:06:58] This is all by election.
[1:07:02] Predestination. It all goes back to
[1:07:04] God's predestination. What kind of
[1:07:05] vessel are we going to be? We should be
[1:07:07] a holy vessel. We should be more than a
[1:07:10] righteous vessel. A righteous person
[1:07:11] will believe there's one God. And they
[1:07:13] might even say three persons. But a holy
[1:07:16] person will know that Jesus is the
[1:07:18] almighty. He's the first and the last,
[1:07:21] alpha and omega, which was, which is,
[1:07:24] and which is to come. He's the A to Z.
[1:07:26] He's all of it. A holy person, in other
[1:07:30] words, a holy person will not add to the
[1:07:32] Bible.
[1:07:34] So friends, let's pray tonight for
[1:07:36] trinitarians. Also, if there's an area
[1:07:38] you don't understand, like my wife and I
[1:07:39] often talk about how deep serpent seed
[1:07:41] is, what if some people I I know the
[1:07:44] children have been telling me, seven
[1:07:45] seals have been deep or the thunders,
[1:07:47] you know, if they're deep, just pray
[1:07:48] tonight and say, "God, help me to grow
[1:07:50] in understanding."
[1:07:54] Hallelujah. In other words, we don't
[1:07:56] want we don't want the deeper things of
[1:07:57] God to be frustration. We have to
[1:07:59] understand that God will uh God will
[1:08:02] take us deeper. Just like when you go
[1:08:03] swimming, right? You guys didn't start
[1:08:04] off, you know, when you when your first
[1:08:06] little child, right, at grandma's pond,
[1:08:08] we don't throw you out into the middle
[1:08:10] right away. We let you walk slowly into
[1:08:13] the deeper waters, right? That's how God
[1:08:16] is. God's not going to throw you into
[1:08:18] the deep end and leave you out there to
[1:08:19] drown. I can't understand the serpent
[1:08:21] seat. I can't understand uh the Godhead.
[1:08:24] I can't understand the
[1:08:26] thunders. God will walk with you. What
[1:08:29] did I do with you all you girls? I
[1:08:31] walked out with you, right?
[1:08:33] No, no, I took you to classes so you can
[1:08:35] learn how to swim. Now, not everybody,
[1:08:36] but the older ones. God's going to take
[1:08:39] you through the class of life. I'll say
[1:08:41] like this, the class of
[1:08:43] revelation. So, if you don't understand
[1:08:46] something, don't be
[1:08:47] discouraged, right? And church, also,
[1:08:50] you can go study it yourself. If you
[1:08:51] want that software, I'll give you the
[1:08:54] software. You can download the app, but
[1:08:55] the app isn't good for searching. It's
[1:08:56] really hard to search. You got to have
[1:08:58] the exact words. With the app, you can
[1:09:00] find things a lot easier. I'm sorry, not
[1:09:02] that, but with the software, it's a lot
[1:09:05] easier. So, think about that. Maybe you
[1:09:07] want to invest in do your own study
[1:09:10] because church, I'll say like this. When
[1:09:11] you know it for yourself, you're
[1:09:13] anchored even more
[1:09:15] because it was God walking you down a
[1:09:17] little deeper in the
[1:09:18] water. Hallelujah. And the Bible says
[1:09:21] the spirit of God searches the deep
[1:09:23] things. Yay, the deep things of God.
[1:09:27] Remember, Brother Ram said it doesn't
[1:09:28] even take a revelation to understand
[1:09:30] water baptism. He said, "It's staring
[1:09:31] you right in the
[1:09:33] face." I love his plain speech.
[1:09:37] Hallelujah. How many have a trinitarian
[1:09:39] friend you'd like to pray for tonight? I
[1:09:41] do. I like I want to pray for my friend.
