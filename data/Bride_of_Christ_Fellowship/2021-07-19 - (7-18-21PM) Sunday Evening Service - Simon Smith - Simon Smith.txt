or stumble you in any way that's my go-to song it tells my story i just gotta talk to the lord and say god help me yeah amen so uh anyhow um sounds like there's a lot of indications for uh this morning's service i was really blessed to hear that and i pray it was a blessing it was uh um something that's of all the revelations i've gotten recently in my battles with uh individuals uh brothers who've turned that was probably the most wonderful to me it means a lot giving it getting it from the lord and anyhow this this evening though i'd like to teach on something uh just a real basic something but uh that's on my heart and we just want to be led by the lord you know obviously and uh so we could go to uh revelations two verse one pennsylvania saints all stayed and you guys got a long haul on the way home so we'll bless you guys and i'm sure it's so i don't want to wear you guys out and stretch you guys out or anything but uh appreciate all everybody for showing up and a big crowd here and for me uh revelations 2 let me hear myself the lord's faithful in all things all i see is his hand of grace constantly uh you know the bible says he's a god a much long suffering and surely we found that out and i find that out daily and i have the pleasure recently of working with an apprentice he's a christian newer christian and uh got twin to some things and he always says you're not lying so you're not lying because when he sees it he sees it he's like yeah you're not lying so i was like yeah all right just waiting for me to catch a little more um anyhow revelations two verse one he says unto the angel of the church of ephesus right these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars and his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks he says i know thy works and i labor and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them which are evil and thou has tried them which say they are apostles that are not and the son of liars that's born and has patience and for my name's sake hath labored and has not painted nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works or else i will come unto thee quickly and remove thy candlestick out of this place except thou repent but this thou has and i call this at home i said this thou has and if there's every uh a little section of churches here that believes in the deeds of nicolaitans the way uh we teach from there i know we believe those things but this thou hast thou has hated the deeds of nicolaitans which i also hate he that hath near letting me hear with the spirit satan the churches to him that overcometh will i give to the eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god so say a word of prayer dearly father lord jesus lord we come lord just slowly lord lord just as you came writing on a mule lord and uh on the back of a donkey there lord jesus so we just pray lord god that you would uh lord use us oh god lord all as a body here little god may you speak what you would have me to say lord god and lord may the the people god love me you give them a strength lord to push through any lord hired spirit god lord or anything that would hinder the service lord rebuke it right now in the name of jesus christ or the lord you just take control of me lord if they need me to be more animated lord or the word needs to be going a different direction lord god i just ask god that you would just give me the very thoughts that you would have me to say i know may i yield my my little mouth here lord to you and lord may you open eyes and ears lord once again as always we love you lord bless your soldiers away from pushing their way out lord and some for my hours and hours away and not all of us were pressing and pushing the lord bless them all bless the service in the name of jesus christ you may have your seats um so uh this morning or tonight i'd like to teach on um turning back oh god so i'd like to like to do a little teaching it might be a little simple whatever but uh i trust to be it'll be okay as uh i i was thinking about turning back in uh revelations two there seems to god my mind when i think about turning back and how we're to turn to the lord i think about when i first came into this message i think about all that i was going through at my time period of life there and i think about how miserable i was in denomination and you know you know absolutely nothing saints you don't know what's right you have no idea what scripture means you have no idea what the importance i'll say this of what we have of the prophet you and and i may have said this before here but the importance of the prophet was that now we have someone that could say that this was the absolute meaning of what this means amen because if you go to the baptist they're going to tell you the baptists are going to say this verse and this bible means a certain something if you go to the methodist they the methodist would say this bible means a certain something if you go to the catholic that means they say that the bible is going to mean a certain something or not you might not need the bible at all they're going to say the catechism is what you need so when you're in that kind of a spiritual state when you're that kind of of that kind of an area you you just sit there or you stand there and say what is right what is the truth what is going on so when i we come into this message and and and those in the movement uh sister christian but jesse uh for the amen or brother brother bang brother amen was a little later but brother bang remembers the very beginning of the we have a i have a we have a picture of me brother rang wow we were babies baby babies like yeah we put some weight on yeah i i was blown away when i got that picture from i think you gave that to me picture i can't remember but when we but jesse found it really just he had it so when we receive this word and i believe i i met your wife sister sarah there at a bible believers banquet maybe i think i met you before when i first come in a couple years or whatever i met your cousins really early sister charity sister faith and uh got to meet all them but but when i come into this to this word my instant thought was we are in the book of acts my expectations were to the smooth my thoughts was like this is we have arrived [Laughter] and within the first two weeks i was telling a certain brother i said brother wherever you want to go door to door and start healing the sick and raising the dead you let me know and he gave me this look like and when he gave me that look i was like what does that mean and then as you continue with the coming the service and and meeting the people you realize wow this this message is kind of messed up [Laughter] the truth of the word is there but you find all kinds it's just as it's what you what you find is a lot of good people absolutely and yet you find a lot of good people in the nomination as well but the difference is the people are all battling denomination in this word of god has come they're all battling but the one difference is the word of god the true interpretation of the word of god and as i was thinking about turning when i first come in and how i was so fired up for the lord i was walking from almost complete towns at a time i walked most of florida ohio i walked mostly defiance or part of defiance i just did a couple blocks in toledo uh covered almost all of houghton ohio uh witnessed a little bit uh did quite a few probably a third or half of delta ohio walked that passed out tracks and i was just on fire for the lord very few came in had a lot of battles in the doorsteps there but nonetheless the word of god stood still it stood solid it did not hinder me it did not phase me or whatever but my initial thought was when i come into this word and baptism by brother craig was showing me baptism i said this is so simple i can't wait to show everyone because it's laying right there this is so easy to see brother william i mean you it was by in five verses you can prove what the true baptism is i mean it's that simple and you know what i said man everyone's gonna see this we're my old pastor's coming in this message i mean no one knows about this well guess what no one could see it no one could see it and if they could see it no one cared and now the realization that we are a special people this is not a simple book not just anyone can see this not just anyone can see and read this and understand it not it's not for everybody it is an elected group of individuals you are you might not think you're special but i'm telling you what you are the apple of god's eye you are chosen and elected from the foundations of the world to see things that no one else on the face of the earth can see praise god but what kind of what kind of what kind of person is god looking for though in the entire bible there is one kind of a man that the bible says has a is a man after god's own heart and that's david now as you would have it sights and sounds is doing david next year and i am going by the grace of god i am going to watch it and i'm going to go there and i'm going to sit and watch this because esther got me hooked [Laughter] now but now notice in first samuel 13 and 14 the bible says but now thy kingdom shall not continue and the lord has sought him a man after his own heart now david was designed this kind of way he if you look at all the rest of the kings whenever one of david's sons or a king from judah or king of israel whatever they'd always compare him back to david and he did not walk in the ways of his father david or he did walk in the ways but not up to so and for he was the standard he was the one that god was the the spirit led the writers of these books to compare him to amen was david but how do you get to be a man after god's own heart you know when saul started getting evil spirits on him and they said bring he said bring in a man with a harp that was ordained of god they brought in david he took the harper and started playing and he was casting out demons with a harp but with that was that his first concert david from a child a youth up you little ones from a youth up david was in at the sheepfold he was a shepherd and he had a harp and he played that heart by himself for hours and hours and hours at a time what just getting in the presence of god by himself out in the wilderness watching sheep and uh i was like this playing before the lord and he had built a relationship with god he would be communing with god as a young boy so much that he'd be playing and a lion would come over and take a sheep and the anointing still owed him because he knew how to entertain god he knew how to worship god he would go and rent the lion and save the land and he'd be playing and a bear would come and steal one but because he was in the presence of god he always glorified god he always was a worshiper of the lord jesus he had victory after victory and god was with him and he was a special designed man like that but he was given for our example he was given for an example of how what we should if there was a man after god's own heart if there was a man after the heart of the lord jesus christ it would be like david so much so that with christ we call the son of david so in other words how are we supposed to be about i'll say like this my brother-in-law brother dustin salmon married my sister betsy and brother dustin's not a real emotional guy but when they first come in to the word of god and they got married right away they had told me one time they would just go and drive the parking lots and they pulled our songbooks out and just sing to the lord [Laughter] in their car just singing to the lord you know what we did on our friday nights and saturday nights when we first come into the word we'd be up to two or three in the morning brother brooks would come out and preach down in fort ohio on a saturday night priest preached freeze to about eight or nine maybe ten and then from ten to about midnight or one we would be in a circle singing for two to three hours all of us would have our song books and you know what our favorite song was i'm one of them i'm one of them i'm so glad they got they got one of them absolutely that was our song and we would sing saturday night after saturday night after saturday night we would do bible studies after the sermons brother craig would teach brother brooks and preach and vice versa and man we were just eating the word we were coming we were on fire for god we'd be worshiping god constantly talking about the word eating we could not get enough bible studies we could not get enough sermons we would go with brother brooks and he would go preach this church and that church in this church and he preached the exact same sermon four times in a row you know what we were there he didn't phase us on sunday nights at outside of this on the weekends we would as soon as i hit friday night and and we all our group there we all said that we lived for the weekend as soon as friday work was over we would drive down to lima and brother brooks would have 15 to 20 young men on his four sleeping bags every weekend did we wrestle we wrestled did we arm wrestle we aren't wrestled did we cut up and joke around absolutely but we loved the lord [Laughter] it was a tremendous golden age golden time but that was my beginning the fire and zeal for god and his word witnessing to everyone in sight and then the last 10 years i've slowed down i have a witness to as many as i used to i lost my zeal what is the part what part what's what's the hard part is you see so few you see everything drying up nobody wants god nobody wants to hear about him very few even listen to you as you witness so what i'm trying to say is i'm not where i used to be but i want to get back to where i want to be and when you bring as you as let's say brother william goes out witnesses or however and a soul comes in and this is this is this is how it works usually as soon as that brother or sister comes in you're going to watch god deal with that young person supernaturally for about a year year and a half and then after that the lord starts pulling away a little bit now he's got to fight for it i've watched it time and time and time again brother mike mccluskey come on into the word there were so many supernatural miracles going on at that time dreams this happened that happened this brother i ran this this almost for a year and a half almost two years god was just boom boom boom boom and then all of a sudden he pulls off he has to let you start fighting for yourself reading the word taking the word obeying it believing it those sort of things now here's another thing he says and when he removed him he raised up unto them a gate of david to be their king to whom he also gave testimony and said i have found david the son of jesse a man after mine heart which shall fulfill all my will what made david different than all the others he wanted to do the will of god alone all he wanted to do was find out the very decisions god had for him to make in life and make the right decisions have we all found our calling do we know what we want to be as far as the lord do you know do we know what the lord wants us to be are there any missionaries in here brothers any evangelists in here any speakers with tongues sisters brothers anyone with gifts of the spirit rolling out ready to go i'm so i'm still waiting on mine too [Laughter] saints of god there are nine spiritual gifts gifts every one of you was born with some of those gifts and we must the saints of god remember what what were those gifts given for to keep this church clean this body clean because satan is either going to rise someone up from within or he's going to bring someone from without in i've watched it happen not here but others but we need the holy ghost to really start dealing now there's only one uh sin really recorded by david and that's when he fell to bathsheba and of course and david comforted bathsheba's wife went into her lay with her and bear a son and called his name solomon the lord loved him now remember as solomon uh was anointed king and the one thing he prayed for was wisdom and god said everything else correct now as as solomon would now be endued with wisdom on high coming straight from god he started to teach and you'll see through his teachings and proverbs a certain thing look what he says here proverbs 2 1 he says my son if thou receive my words and hide my commandments with these he says sow that thine thou incline thine ear unto wisdom and apply thy heart to understanding he says yea if thou criest after knowledge he says and lifted up their voice for understanding if thou seeketh her as silver and searches for her as for hidden treasures thou shalt understand the fear of the lord and find the knowledge of god amen in other words saints of god the beginning of all wisdom is the fear of the lord jesus christ amen if we fear a lot of times people will continue just in life and act like this doesn't exist or it doesn't apply for them for that moment or they say well they just kind of like get a little relaxed and let a little bit slip and slide how that that kind of way well cut corners or something like that and now i got a little testimony on that here coming up for the lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding now notice he says he says boys he says listen to me i'm going to give you some wisdom look look what he says to deliver thee from the strange woman even from the stranger with flat earth with her words which forsaketh the guide of her youth and forget the covenant of her god he says guys he says watch out brother he says watch out for these women they're strange women notice in proverbs five and three says for the lips of a strange woman he says drop as a honeycomb and her mouth is smoother than oil but her end as is as bitter as wormwood sharp as a two-edged sword her her feet go down to death her steps take hold on hell so all this wisdom is coming to solve and in the main wisdom he says beware of these women proverbs 5 20 and will thou thy son uh wilt thou my son be ravished by us with a strange woman embrace the bosom of a stranger continually warning he says in uh proverbs 6 and 23 for the commandment is a lamp and the light the law is a light and reproves of instruction of the way of life to keep thee from the evil woman from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman thus not after her beauty and thine heart and thine heart which goes right back what to jesus he says if you're lost after a woman he said you've already committed adultery with her in her heart in your heart he says lust not after beauty and that heart lest neither let her take thee with her eyelids for what means a woman is a woman a man is brought to a piece of bread and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life can a man take fire into his bosom and his clothes not be burned look at all this wisdom psalms compiling for us my son keep my words and lay up the commandments unto thee keep my commandments and live in my my law as the apple of thine eye bind them upon thy fingers and write them upon the tables of their hearts saying to the sins of wisdom he says thou art my sister and call understanding my kissmen that they may keep thee from the strange woman time and time and time this wisdom that he prayed for and god was showing him beware of women strange women the mouth of the strange woman is a deep pit he that the of the lord shall fall therein all right runs all the way through proverbs he says my son give me thine heart and let thine eyes observe my ways for a is a deep ditch and the strange woman is a narrow hit she also lieth in weight as for prey and increases the transgressors among men proverbs 23 and verse 33 thine eyes shall behold strange woman and thine heart shall utter perverse things so time and time and time again solomon now given given this wisdom he has wisdom he's given this wisdom and god gives it to him and a lot of this message is focused towards with wild women i'll say it like that now now these are his teachings these are his sermons these are proverbs one some of the greatest understandings of the scripture but at the end of solomon's life but king solomon loved many strange women together with the daughter of pharaoh the women of moabites amorites zionites and hittites all these nations even to these in love and he had 700 wives princesses three hundred cockman's wives turned away his heart yet he talked against it and taught against and taught against intelligence and yet he partook himself now remember solomon was the first old testament church age messenger he was the type of the first heat another one remember david was a type of christ and then his son what would move right into the first church age of the old testament and notice because of women his heart his divine love for god had fallen now into the pit sure and it came to pass with psalms all that his wives turned away his heart from with after other gods and his heart was not perfect with the lord his god as was the heart of david his father noticed compares right back to daddy sure now what are they trying to say here in general now we're in laodicea in general there is traps out there in 19 1990s when i was just growing up me and brother jess was tempted to go fully into basketball or or just football or track there was sports and you know what's brand fresh new on the scene was video games that hit late 80s early 90s with video games and it was powerful that first mario game was whoa wow atari 2600 that was that was a heavy hitter too yeah but before that what was entertainment you had like that little bouncy ball with some jacks he had board games those sort of things but now in this generation now 2021 there are a million outlets there are a million things you guys could get into to divert you away from christ now look at this first pier five and eight now remember the technology was never been like this before maybe before flood maybe greater but not like this if you go on instagram you can become a celebrity if you start a youtube channel you can be a celebrity and make millions of dollars or thousands of dollars or hundreds of thousand dollars tens of thousands however you want to do it you can be well known now an average ordinary girl that's pretty can be famous right just by flashing herself for flesh all over the video a good-looking man or a man that's intelligent can make videos and do all those things and now my brother here does fantastic work uh saving souls and giving wisdom and edifying the bride as the brother in the debate said the for one probably the top uh apologetics apologetics of the of the message but in this day you can do anything you want literally you brother you can do anything you want in life yeah you young brothers young sisters but now loki says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that some afflictions are accomplished to your brother that are in the world in other words the satan is setting traps all around for you and for the young people things that will take and harness your time things will take and harness your life i want to show the young sisters here in a couple of bit here now notice this finally my mother my brother be strong in the lord and the power of his might put on the whole armor of godly people stand against the wiles of the devils what are the wilds the traps of the devil there's traps out there you know there's golf driving competitions now you don't have to be a good golfer but if you can crush the ball you can make some money and their competitions are on sunday so you have to miss church now how many young young people are here brother sister young young young okay do you guys know what you want to do when you grow up oh sister it's just a character she just wants to be a sweetheart good good are you guys good at professional basketball how about professional tennis professional wrestling okay if you guys want even the sisters you guys can be professional disc golf players they have their own real deal money making careers in disc golf look at look at the fans do you think this guy loose weights absolutely not look at the guy up next and on deck what kind of fits that you can do anything you want anything you want to make a professional sport you can make it and these guys have their own websites they make real money real skills these are obviously guys who are not good at football probably not good at basketball but they can throw frisbees like a madman and they travel around and get sponsors professional i'm not talking amateur i'm talking professional look they have their own little logo here just like mbl or footballing they don't like frisbees where's the young sisters at anybody got braces in here if you sisters need braces the american cornhole professional league two pieces of wood on the ground with a hole in it with bag bean bags and look this girl is competing with this full-size man and they are professionals and there's a hundred and fifty thousand dollars worth of prizes you can do whatever you want to do professional you think these guys are good at basketball look they're sponsored sponsors you got their names on their jerseys if those are jerseys i don't know if they're warming best of jerseys but satan in this age is setting up that you can do any sister b you can throw you could probably do american core cornhole league you could do that like this i'm going to show you i'm going to example you take the bag like this like that yeah you want to be a pro william don't laugh you're up next brother no skills well you have a little bit of skills but if you guys want to do something instead of work cornhole let's say you're not good with cornhole and you have a rifle arm it's the american dodgeball league they have amateur leagues and they have professional leads now these are these are high school for those who grew up in the in in the world or in public school these are high school gym classes and now over the space of 20 25 years they've become professional sports literally you can do anything professionally you want to do brother william remember when you threw that 95 mile long fastball pitch in high school there you go never made the bigs there you go satan is setting all kinds of traps to steal your time and energy i guarantee you if we go through any of these and look at schedules wednesday nights sundays because remember these are average people who are professional which means i'm pretty sure they have a full-time job somewhere else and the only time they can compete is on saturdays and sundays [Laughter] saints of god if you can't see the traps here unbelievable here's a girl with braces she's probably 15 years old and she's competing with this guy's in his 50s i'll bet late 40s there's another she's a little bit older lady and i mean this guy's got his back his hat on backwards real deal these guys are doing professional stuff the devil is remember the jesus said broad is the way that leadeth to hell what if one day i'm offered a contract to start in dodge ball and i was like well i'll just give it a try for fun for an outlet for energy for exercise or whatever and i sign up let's say i can dodge pretty good and i can catch ball and i don't have the best arm but i can catch the ball and i'm getting people out and man hey you want to go professional that's going to mess my entire life up i'm supposed to teach bible studies oh my goodness in mark 4 and 18 and these are they which are sown among thorns which hear the word of god in the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lust of other things entering in choke the word and it becomes unfruitful do you think any of these guys are solid christians full-time jobs probably being professional some kind of athletes now notice here luke 9 and 61 another said lord i will follow thee but let me go first go bid them for well which are which are at home at my house and jesus said no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god isn't that what peter and them did as soon as christ was crucified they said what i go of fishing he went right back to the exact same life the back exact same position he was in before the move of god came but jesus had to pull him out amen he saved them twice he called him twice and got him out of that mode amen he was called for something greater amen yes lord sure now now what came to pass is when as they went that he entered into a certain village and a certain woman named martha received him into her house and she had a sister called mary which also sat at jesus feet and heard his word i'm teaching a little about myself here because i get i get caught up too much doing stuff for people i was i was dealing with a brother brother gareth i don't know if you guys met him before but he called me a freelancer because i do a lot of free work you know he's like brother freelancing today i was like no i'm just probably but notice what he says here and martha was cumbered about with much serving and came to him and said lord dost thou not care that my sister hath left me left me alone to serve to serve alone bid her therefore that she help me and jesus answers unto martha martha thou art careful and troubled about many things i feel like i'm in them shoes sometimes many times anybody here else busy with their lives i've got to do this and i've got to do that and i've got to do this we're just running around just running around like a in a whirlwind in the days almost so busy how did life speed up so much from the 1920s how did things get so busy to push and i'll say it like this they're doing it on purpose but johnny if you know i don't know if you know but back when i first started the trades in 2002 probably from 2002 to 2010 the pace of the jobs was is a nice moderate pace but right around 2008 2010 it seemed like the push the schedules they put on the workers was was twice as hard and i and i think i figured out because many of the superintendents and those high up were getting bonuses if they got it done in a certain time and they they shot the time shorter and they gave them bonuses they got it done in that time but the weight fell on the workers the people who actually had to work and labor and get these things finished now here is a sister and the prophet god called her dilator he says but one thing is needful and mary has chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her but what about what's martha's story was martha saved what was martha now notice what the prophet god said about martha now martha must have recognized this that what god was god so jesus was god he says although he she had been busy taking care of a house dishwashing and so forth but there he she showed her color crying over her dead brother but when jesus came martha was the one that ran out and was dealing with and prophet the prophet god said he says when two omnipotents meet he called martha an omnipotent and when two of them something must take place she was built as a worker she couldn't help it but when it came time to show who she was she was the one with christ saying lord if whatsoever you say right now can happen amen and she believed it i believe she was put in here for this age because we're just running and running and running hurry hurry hurry get done get done you're done just get it done all right my boss was a master at that my old boss i'd be getting there two weeks late from when the job started and said sorry we gotta get this done i'm like chuck i haven't even seen the prince yet and every day he'd give me a pep talk hey sorry hey we just really need to get shot there yeah i know yeah no but i'm telling you if you just push little by me we've just really got to get this done because we've got this coming up like yeah i know and every day you get a pep talk hey hey we just got it we just got a really good this is a great job but you just got to get it done i mean hey no matter what it takes just get i know i know i know i know i know every day just get it done get done i know i know they're just pushing and pushing and pushing and pretty much soon pretty soon your brain gets calloused and you don't care you know what i say you don't get done when it gets done and you know what jesus christ is saying right now it's going to get done when i get it done you can't hurry me you can't do anything just that he's my one he said then my timing this child will get done when my spirit rises up and he declares it's over amen when i come on the scene it'll get done i'm not dependent on anyone else but myself amen yes lord yeah but there when lazarus was resident she said she showed her colors she really showed what was in her she went to get him immediately a man now are there other true colors hidden in the scripture notice here in john 3 here comes nicodemus by night what must i do to enter the kingdom of heaven jesus starts breaking things down and he's just going what i have to enter into my mother's what and jesus said you're a master in israel and you don't know these things he says how can you understand spiritual things you can't understand but something stuck something took place that night with nicodemus the way christ remember he had a meeting he had a conference with christ and when christ spoke i'm telling you when christ speaks it is it it does something to you when you hear the words of the bible something comes off these pages and into your heart the bible says faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god so every time you read this when i read this like this even in silent i can hear myself reading it in my mind but does the faith come immediately no it says it cometh faith cometh by hearing it didn't say when it would come he said it would come amen so if you don't have faith for something right now you just keep reading and hearing and hearing and hearing and saying to god one day that faith is going to strike and god is going to answer your prayer amen yes sure now nicodemus comes to the christ gets a mini sermon and he's just like wow what did he mean there but as we see christ was crucified and after this the crucifixion and after this joseph of arimathea being a disciple of jesus but secretly for fear of the jews he was a secret believer brother joseph he says basalt pilot that he might take away the body of jesus and pilate gave him leave he came therefore and took the bible body of jesus and there came also nicodemus he knew there was something special about him i don't know what he i don't know how many conspiracy friends he lost but i'll tell you what when christ was there when the body was dead he was there taking care of it he showed his true colors right there hey man when the i'll tell you i'll when this squeeze starts hitting you're going to see some secret believers some believers who did not look strong some believers who did not look they were all in all the way but i'll tell you what they're in all the way amen remember sometimes god will well he trained john the baptist for 30 years 30-year training for six months of ministry he trained christ for 30 years for three months three years worth of ministry and he has been training us tell you what i'm saying i i as i look at my spiritual maturity from when i was a christian in 2002 2003 wow i was pretty wild i said a lot of things i shouldn't have said and did a lot of things i shouldn't have done looking back i was like man i was so immature but i just came right out of the world a year into the nomination and you're writing the message i was like man that was so worthy didn't even know it at the time i thought i was i thought i was a book of acts man i needed a red pet i had to repent after i just repented saints of god we are god is honing us and honing us and i can and i can see now why you meet a real holy ghost phil the older gentleman and you can see like brother brother michael he says he's an old oak tree just full of wisdom and loving and kind and soft and i'm like man i just want to be an oak tree but god is preparing us he's honing us with the trials within your lives children and work and and dealing with those and each other and all that god is honing you building you ready same with you same with you all of us god he's using your your very uh characteristic various situations in your life to hone you very thoughts doubts he's putting bears in front of you so you can barrel through them jump over them overcome them he's doing that right now for your life i just talked with brother mj and that was putting thoughts like this and thoughts like that and thoughts like this and brother he's just gonna have to barrel through them you've got to we've got all to learn to fight through these mind battles one of the greatest things that ever stuck with me was when brother brooks came and preached at our church and he said he said this one phrase he said he said you are the god of the devil that never left me you know what i do now when i get them thoughts or this and that i tell the devil what to do i said no no i don't hear that and then i started preaching him i said let me tell you something about your future and what your testimony is and the sins you've committed and my sins are forgiven but yours are not forgiven and cannot be forgiven you're going to end up in the lake of fire because the word of god says so i will be up in heaven by the grace of god and by his sacrifice which he provided so what do you talk to me for even now in my house when i see a spider i kill it and i said listen all ye insect inhabitants of my house there is no spiders allowed my house and i just had to say to my aunts yesterday i said there is no ants going to be entering my house there is nothing here to eat you are built for outside spiders too you're a bill for outside and out of my house and i've started commanding them that's my house they're not paying the mortgage they're not paying it they don't have jobs they're not leaving any money so they're not allowed in my house and you know what my spiders have really dropped since i've been speaking that they're not they're not i just killed one in the last five months after this winter it was almost like two a day and they've dropped why just speaking it we have to get the point where we are controlling our atmospheres our households and i know many of you do but we have to get to that point amen now i know it's just kind of basic service he says and take heed to yourselves at any of time less than any time your hearts be overcharged with surviving and with drunkenness and cares this life and so that they come upon you unawares for as a snare or a trap shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come upon the past and to stand before the son of man i just watched a video of a bible teacher and you know the bible says in matthew i'm sorry luke 17 he says it shall be as in the days of noah and the days of lot and he and jesus said there'll be no sign given to this generation but the sign of jonah there was just a whale that swallowed a man this year i think last month and he survived he came back out they just built the ark down in kentucky they built just another one over in england and they tried to sail apart but they wouldn't give it seaworthiness they couldn't sail it thanks for god the lord is showing us little things here about time we're getting close we're getting very close and then and that was caught by a denominational preacher that wasn't the message that wasn't a message ranks that was the nomination i called that i was like whoa that was a good catch god is showing to them they missed the super sign but they are catching the other signs [Laughter] hey man they met they missed malachi 4 but they sure seeing jonah right here oh my yeah um sure now now therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in the christ jesus and the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou under faithful men that shall be able to teach others also thou therefore endure hardness is a good soldier of christ jesus christ no man that warth entangles himself in the affairs of this life how do we do this how do we not entangle ourselves in the affairs of this life number one nothing will control you except what god has for you to do number one starting today on that left side jobs or work control me right if my wife does something i'm not going to get mad at her i would just go crazy when my dog bites somebody i say praise god when something bad happens i see wonderful when someone says hey brother psy can you do this i pray about it and say lord do you want me to do this for somebody i had probably four or five people maybe two or three people in the church call me to do plumbing in one week one guy is sewer backed up another brother needed this this this and this this all done but the day before the brother called i got some i bought some plywood off a job site for half price the guy made me a deal i was loading this plywood up and at the edge of one of these half-inch boards there's a name in red written dave we got two big d well we got a big dave and a medium dave and i said i need to call big dave and before i even called him on the way home he called me says brother i've got a plumbing problem and i know the lord wanted me to do that to help him it took two and a half days but we got it done up to about 11 12 rolling in the crawl space with johnny you know how pulling out lines cutting lines drain them all running all the way back to the septic tank digging up the septa tank line it was quite the ordeal but the lord he was prepping me for it he showed me dave all day amen so that was an ordained one there now now look at this here and if a man also strived for masteries yet he is not crowned except he do it except he strive lawfully in other words i don't care how good a christian you are if you don't live the right kind of way it'll be not be accepted right when i was in college i was not i was in like division three cross country five mile race and one race i cut a corner but everybody's cutting me for me so what i do i was not backpack i was not frontback i was mid-pack now i just cut the corner with them and then years later i was coming to a certain situation in my life and i prayed i said lord why am i going through this and that night he gave me a dream and he showed me in that same race doing a certain thing cutting a corner so when you cut corners you're not going to be rewarded it'll hinder you if everyone would have everyone to cut that corner in college in that race if they would have been caught we would all be disqualified so we think we're going to heaven or run this christian race and cut one corner if you repent and don't get baptized you're not gonna make it right and yet know all the mysteries if you were pat and you're baptized and do not receive the baptism of the holy ghost you're not gonna make the right though you know all the mystery we can't cut any corners god help us amen now what barnes say about this yet he is not crowned except he strived lawfully in conformity with the rules of the games no one could obtain the prize unless he had complied with all the laws of the game and had thus given to those of whom he contended a fair opportunity to succeed in these contests he who transgressed the rules in the least matter not only failed of the prize even though the apparent victor but was sometimes disgraced and punished in other words if the man was good and yet he missed one thing and he won he was disappointed all right amen now look at these as brother chris hall mastery done 20 years ago not everyone that saith lord lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many of him shall say unto me lord have we not prophesied thy name right he says and in thy name cast out devils in thy name done many wonderful works yes i will profess to them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity mark 16 these here's two sets of people doing the exact same thing one accepted and one is rejected what was the difference workers of iniquity what is we all know these what is iniquity knowing to do something to do it right but not doing it not doing it the right way god help us amen now hold you almost an hour give me a little bit here turning back getting back to because our whole goal is what jesus said he would restore us back to the faith of our fathers which was matthew mark luke john the book of acts that's that is our goal and we will not be satisfied until we reach that goal we are something inside of us says we are going to get it i'll say like the saints when we think about the word of god and going back to that i can like visualize i can like see myself i can see myself running out of here just as fast i can run into whoever can say sir do you know have you been baptized in the name of jesus christ do you want to know we've got us i mean just excited for the gospel fearless witnessing to all and then what if we could hear the very hear the very word the voice of god and perform his works with the same power and demonstration that christ had back there that's what we want remember therefore for once that would fall and repent and do the first works evidently something had left their minds he says remember they have forgotten something he told them to turn back in their minds to the point of their origin the origin of the first age was pentecost right they had fallen from it they had forgotten the glory and the wonder of it now we we can hear tapes of how powerful the sermons were in the 50s and 60s and the glory and wonder of what it was like in those services it was time to go back in mind and then in reality so it's a mind state and that's it it is an expectation amen literally our mind we should be i'm just going to say it like this saints of god every day we wake up we go pray read the bible and every day we should be praying without ceasing for the coming of the lord for service on wednesday nights for service on sunday mornings we should be calling each other on saturday nights say brother get the bed early we got service in the morning praise be to god we should all be driving here and as we enter this should be like oh this should be a holy reverent place when we enter those doors we walk trod softly no joking around no carrying i mean and i know we're people but we should be so reverent and holy remember if that was like that in the old testament and then new though we have more liberties in the new we should have even more reference to what it is living such a high life but i'm telling you what it takes the anointing it takes the holy ghost to live that kind of life the times when i've lived that kind of life is when the holy ghost was i felt the anointing on me let me tell you it's different when you don't know he's there or you can't feel him to when you can feel him all right was like this brother william if i know you're watching me i'm going to conduct myself a certain way and probably a little over extreme but when you're out of sight i'm just gonna be me you know but christ has all seen amen we have to get conscious of the unrecognized presence of god he is watching all the time he is listening all the time before the prophecy our thoughts are louder in heaven than even our words i'll help us i know this scene a jumper and shout out but i'm telling this just and maybe it's for me which muslim he says now back when you could say for me to live is christ back to purity when ananias and spy were dealt with back to the gate beautiful oh my goodness when the lame man was risen he says oh we're approaching this to drift from god into and uh countenance those things those acts that defile his name let those who name his name depart from sin and keep their vessels pure for god look at once you what uh you once were in your heart and mind in your life and then go back to it amen brother johnny when you first come into the word you were raised the message right no so when you come and heard this word how did you act yeah when you first come as a christian and did you have more zeal than you had now yeah me too absolutely bang were you on fire 20 years ago yeah me too brother jess has been pretty consistent i don't know he's got he's i he definitely needs god's grace but tell you what he's he's chosen one number four okay now so if we can like positionally like i said this morning from this hour from this moment get our mindset back to this was fresh go back to when you heard this is right here was raised the message right but when you first really realized what you had what was it like that first baptism of the holy ghost it had to be it became real it was no longer mom and daddy going to church and said oh my goodness jesus wants something to do with me now what is the way back the way is the way of repentance now here's a burner this was hard for me if a sinner has come to god by a way of repentance then the lukewarm or backslider will have to repent that much more oh god have mercy this is a year of this is the year of the altar for me amen praise god repent bring forth its first fruits meat for repentance prove it by your life if you do not repent god said i'll remove your can't lampstand certainly a church that is in that condition cannot give light to the world he says its light has turned to darkness god will then take away his faithful messenger and his faithful shepherds and leave them to themselves and they will go on talking about christianity but be bereft of it hey that's that's not where you want to be amen now in closing uh let's stand here dealing with ephesus it came the point that it says they did not repent fact he said there was not even one christian left in that city and the lamp was rent from its place now it doesn't not mean that she could not have repented it does not that mean that we cannot repent we can but it must be quickly it must be a true heart cry to god and sorrow and then god what and then god will restore everyone everyone want to be a joel 2 army the wall will fire round about you and army before or after leaping over whatever kind of walls and jumping into windows whatever that means anybody want to be joel 2 i want to be in that army and you know how the bible says to get to that army it says we must repent get out of the laodicean grind that attitude that's just all the way just every day you know what charles finney said would take a revival he said each one of us needs to close up our shops for six months quit your jobs for six months and just meet the house of god all day long and praying fast he said and then you'll have a revival how many are willing to do that that was late 1800s finney had a 98 percent the salvation keeping rate too of all this converts 98 of them stayed that's powerhouse that is the power of god on a man then when he spoke one word things would take place in the late 1800s he was that serious for us to live is christ amen besides that hard how we can do this i have no idea how we're going to do this but he said he would have a church amen now he says again god will restore and the glory will come again i want to read one more quote here for you as we close here now look at this satan told eve eve believed it all but just a little bit and he told her they just take all of it but just a little bit might be go to the pool it might be something else you just got to take it every bit just the way it is here see just the way it is said here i'm i'm guessing you're talking about the word might call you to do some first works over again but it's just what the word said this was satan's trick since he worked on the first to just disbelieve a little bit of the word in other words let me say it like this i was thinking about this back there to disbelieve just a little bit of the word if there's a blind man right here for the maokai can god heal that blind man can you go over there and lay your hands on and heal the blind man ah that was different jesus can do it but man my life's not perfect can i do that if i pray over that blind man will god heal it can god heal it oh yeah absolutely all of us can agree god can heal that blind man right there but sister huh can you go over there and pray over that and god heal it coming down to the rubber meets the road well johnny if you reach out your long arms over there standing in that same position and touch that blind man will god heal it through your anointing by your prayer and you know how humans brother william's like so the william goes on praise oh i'm right behind that i'll lay my hands on brother william and we'll both pray but i'm believing that god's gonna answer his prayer not mine we all believe god can do anything but can god do anything through you will god hear my prayer do i have enough faith for it just that little bit we all believe that god's god probably the lord jesus christ can do anything at any time to anyone for anything but can he use you lydia blind guy go pray over him i'll turn my back like this well god answer it yes you believe that we have to have our faith believing all the word if you ask it shall be given to you in prayer how many have desires things we need fixed in our lives things we need answered ask and shall be given to you well i have enough faith to pray for uh brother amen but i don't know about my life but i believe god's gonna do something for you your life as well do we believe this all of it and it shall be given and it shall then say when it shall be given seek and ye shall find i need to know god in a way i've never known him cause he would find him knock and it shall be opened do you believe that saints of god these are absolute powerhouse scriptures these things come on this scripture here can unlock anything if we had a revelation if you believe that god was going to answer your prayer and your desires our joys would be overflowing sure now a little bit here last last quote what's the matter with the tabernacle a man ought to be able to say when when you meet a man is your christian experience when was it that is your christian experiences when was a dearest dearest to you you ought to be able to say right now now notice what this he says well notice what this man says well my best experience was back when i first got the baptism of the holy ghost when i came what brother bam say about that oh brother you've fallen from you mean to tell me that the first time you received the baptism of the holy ghost and you hang on to that one experience and for 20 years say that was it i've fallen from grace we should have more refillings as thanks to god as we reach more and greater spiritual maturity stasher of perfect man anyone here busting to a vision lately the bible says that if you i think it's uh it says if you i'm just gonna paraphrase but if you live clean enough the very angels of heaven will visit your home anyone living clean enough the angels are visiting your home homes are we living in the presence of god brother cam went got an invitation to preach up in canada the man had two churches after service the holy ghost came down in service after service the man went to the deacon's house but it came with dean's house he said brother the presence of god was there first time he's ever experienced it he said you could feel the presence of god the entire time you're in the house everyone can feel it angels angel visitations because we live so close close to god amen o israel return unto god thy god for thou has fallen by what iniquity there's things we know we should do we get lazy but ram said he says i don't wake up and pray like i should because i'm lazy i get william branham gets tired simon smith gets really really tired absolutely anyhow all hearts minds clear for tonight saints of god i really believe we're at a time when we have to start if we have not purposed in our heart to start turning and changing and letting all this laotian stuff go especially this guy we've got to start now it's got we should have started we're far behind the denominations we're far behind i'll say this the the the worldly the sa even the satanic they're in spiritual realms i mean bad ones but they're they're in their spiritual realm we it seems like like the prophet said she's just staggering she's just we're moving so slow but god's going to get us there everyone believe that i feel all right let's just lift our hands a little bit here and stretch out and just anyone need prayer if you desire a closer walk the lord jesus christ let's just dedicate rededicate ourselves today as as those who travel home brother or sister here from pennsylvania may you guys talk about the word talk about the lord and leading songs and however the lord lead you guys on your way home [Music] but william is you guys drive home we want to we want to think about the lord talk about him and he will draw near david got into the presence of god by entertaining god all the time thinking about him worshiping him he was so in the spirit that his songs were prophetic it brought forth the future you know david's sing that song is why uh uh why would we sing songs and we're in babylon that was even before the captivity that's prophetic plus powerheads all hearts and hearts and minds clear desiring greater things with jesus christ greater higher heights and deeper depths in the word and higher heights in the spirit let's just say a prayer here dear lord jesus lord you know my heart's desire in order to get there lord lord as i see my own failures uh iniquities god things i fall short here and fall short there and sometimes i don't even have hardly a defense lord jesus so we are asking god that you would strengthen each one of us the bible says you would ask [Music] or this body change lord lord for bringing ushering in the second branch god the book of acts lord jesus we just ask that you are allowed right now whatever anyone's life when things take place [Music] if we need more character god may give us more care we need a greater prayer life lord anoint the sword if we need to feed the inner man god may we read like never before lord jesus lord if we've got the witness to get bold god give us both lord lord jesus we've got to raise our faith god raise our faith lord jesus then we can speak what you put on our hearts god and it would take place lord may if lord if there's anything about ourselves god winning glory just take it from us lord for certainly lord we want only you to receive glory and praise and honor lord god from the works that you do through our lord you know god be with you so reverend humble lord loving one another lord with real godly love sweet and kind lord humble realizing lord any day lord this could be our last moment together because our brother has shared now three teenagers passed off none of us are guaranteed another laid over the other life another
