[19:04] Stephen said he couldn't make it today
[19:05] his neck is bothering him so let's
[19:06] remember brother Stephen in prayer
[19:08] whether a man put an unspoken request in
[19:11] for his wife so let's remember sister

[19:15] but he meant then Lydia woke up she's
[19:17] feeling kind of sick like just a stomach

[19:43] amen unspoken okay
[19:47] let's remember this gentleman he's been
[19:49] watching our videos from Texas he's he
[19:53] said it's through my ministry that he's
[19:55] been brought back to the Lord and I
[19:57] talked in the last few weeks I talked to
[19:58] him yesterday and seemed like he's doing
[20:01] well but let's just remember him in
[20:02] prayer he was raising the message left
[20:04] it for 20 years and now he wants to come
[20:06] back I said in my book he's almost done
[20:08] with it already and it just sees
[20:11] everything the same way we see it you
[20:12] know with brother Rams a prophet but we
[20:14] got to rightly divide you know not every

[20:23] trying to do we're trying to feed the
[20:24] people here and then if this little
[20:26] message we're preaching can be taken to
[20:28] others and help them praise God it's
[20:31] just all done the same way through

[35:50] said thank you for your prayer so praise
[35:52] the Lord
[35:57] I'd like to uh Lord willing read a
[35:59] couple texts
[36:01] let me just say over the livestream for
[36:03] my wife honey if you can't hear me let
[36:05] me know cuz I have to use this when it
[36:06] doesn't work sometimes I don't know I'm
[36:10] not sure what happens I'm not an audio
[36:12] tech guy so let's uh let's read our text
[36:16] for today and then we'll read on the
[36:17] reverse ask sister Karen for a scripture
[36:19] so she gave us a great scripture for our
[36:23] text that I'd like to read acts 14:23 I
[36:25] like to it's kind of long the same lines
[36:28] of this Philippians series but I just
[36:30] want to just preach a few sermons on
[36:33] taking sides with Jesus it's programs
[36:36] it's basically his pattern for apostolic
[36:40] ministry so I just want to preach you
[36:44] know his apostolic vision he calls it
[36:46] his vision
[36:48] so I want to just preach on that ex
[36:51] 14:23
[36:53] it kind of just grounds you and
[36:57] establishes you in the truth that we are
[36:59] doing exactly what the church always has
[37:02] done
[37:03] we're no different than the day of
[37:05] Pentecost Church we're doing the exact
[37:08] same thing and so that's what brother
[37:10] man came to do he came to point us back
[37:12] to the Bible back to the Apostolic
[37:14] fathers so let's just read acts 14:23
[37:17] then when we read our memory verse from
[37:18] sister Karen out of Isaiah 12 but let's
[37:22] start with
[37:23] acts 14:23
[37:32] okay if you're there say Amen let's read
[37:35] this one together here acts 14:23 one
[37:38] two three and when they had ordained
[37:41] them elders in every city and had prayed
[37:45] with fasting they commanded them to the
[37:48] Lord on whom they believed praise God
[37:51] now let's go to Isaiah 12 verse two
[37:57] just a beautiful scripture here
[38:00] appreciate you sharing that when sister
[38:02] Karen beautiful scripture about the Lord
[38:05] is our strength in our salvation
[38:08] let's sing unto the Lord praise God I
[38:13] stay at 12 we'll do 12 I'm sorry I was a
[38:16] twelve two three four and five just a
[38:18] beautiful portion thereof scripture
[38:26] okay let's read that and that's the Lord
[38:28] to write it on our hearts here Isaiah
[38:30] twelve verse two let's begin on three
[38:32] one two three behold god is my salvation
[38:36] i will trust and not be afraid for the
[38:41] lord jehovah is my strength and my song
[38:44] he also is become my salvation
[38:48] therefore with joy shall ye draw water
[38:52] out of the wells of salvation and in
[38:56] that day shall ye say praise the lord
[38:59] call upon his name declare his doings
[39:03] among the people make mention that his
[39:06] name is exalted sing unto the Lord for
[39:10] he hath done excellent things this is
[39:13] known in all the earth praise God what a
[39:15] beautiful scripture beautiful that's how
[39:18] word of Prayer if you have another need
[39:19] on your heart just make it own unto the
[39:20] Lord by raising your hand or
[39:22] whispering and prayer here Heavenly
[39:25] Father we love you we're happy to be
[39:26] gathered in your house today father we
[39:28] just pray you'll speak to us through
[39:30] your word anoint us Lord
[39:31] you set apart from you we could do
[39:34] nothing so Lord we know none of us have
[39:36] any power here if we could we would heal
[39:38] everybody if it was up to us or we would
[39:41] we would do everything we could if we
[39:43] could do it ourselves but we can't we
[39:45] need your leadership we need your
[39:47] anointing so father just anoint us God
[39:50] for your glory today to hear to believe
[39:51] to understand to act upon your word Lord
[39:55] God and be with all those requests Lord
[39:57] that that we made known Lord God earlier
[39:59] I just pray you be with each person Lord
[40:02] God in a special way to guide us into
[40:04] your truth in Jesus Christ's name and
[40:07] the church said Amen god bless you to me
[40:09] and she did praise God
[40:14] okay so I got a text from my wife said
[40:16] we can hear you perfectly praise the
[40:17] Lord Amen thank the Lord and again they
[40:20] be here except my you know Lydia kind of
[40:21] got sick right before we were about
[40:23] ready to leave so we prayed for her
[40:27] little stomach bug there
[40:33] alright so I want to basically like I
[40:35] said preach down just through this this
[40:38] portion of taking sides with Jesus it's
[40:41] become more clear to me over the last
[40:45] few weeks that this is important for us
[40:47] to to see and understand about
[40:51] the apostolic pattern of churches and I
[40:56] think and even through this this
[40:57] particular portion of taking sides with
[41:00] Jesus because remember there's too it's
[41:01] a ministers meeting when he preaches
[41:03] this it's in June of 62 the first half
[41:06] it's divided in two halves the first
[41:08] half is directly about how his vision is
[41:12] for how to spread the message that's his
[41:15] that's the first half the second half he
[41:17] just preaches about how when you if you
[41:20] were on earth at Jesus's time you would
[41:22] have had to take sides with him and you
[41:23] would have begin you would have been
[41:24] against all the religious people that
[41:26] day and you would have had to stand with
[41:28] Jesus you had have taken sides with
[41:29] Jesus and the example was the the man
[41:33] that was blind that Jesus gave His sight
[41:35] and then they brought him before the the
[41:37] the church elders right and and brought
[41:39] it I'm sorry I brought his parents and
[41:41] him before the elders and the parents
[41:42] took sides with you know the religious
[41:44] Pharisees but the the man that was made
[41:48] well he took sides with Jesus and then
[41:51] brother man said Jesus found him after
[41:53] they cast him out but a man said that's
[41:55] what God will do God will find us after
[41:57] the church is cast us out
[41:59] amen so I'm thankful he found me praise
[42:02] God amen I was cast out rejected
[42:06] counted out but Jesus found me praise
[42:09] God and I'm happy to be with you praise
[42:11] God God's a despised few praise the Lord
[42:15] so I just felt led you know to preach on
[42:18] this today maybe a couple more services
[42:21] we'll see by God's grace and then
[42:23] tonight we'll have four o'clock service
[42:25] here if you want to come if you want to
[42:26] stay at home that's fine like I said I
[42:28] just want to respect everybody during
[42:29] this time but I really feel burdened to
[42:31] get back to the house of the Lord like I
[42:34] said fifty days you know I just I feel
[42:38] it's just the time to do it you know
[42:41] some churches I know have never have
[42:44] never stopped gathering for any service
[42:46] which is okay I think that's fine if
[42:48] they feel led to do that the
[42:49] Constitution doesn't it's not against
[42:52] that the Constitution's for it that's
[42:53] the reason men like I was telling I
[42:55] think Haven asked me this morning daddy
[42:57] is it wrong and when we go to church I
[42:58] said no men died men and women died that
[43:01] we could have this freedom that's the
[43:03] whole purpose of this Constitution was
[43:05] to give us the freedoms we want to use
[43:07] wisdom in the midst of it but we're
[43:10] doing nothing wrong it's wrong to say
[43:13] you can't do what we're doing today
[43:14] praise God that's what's wrong so we're
[43:18] doing what's right but again if people
[43:21] have their convictions that's fine but
[43:23] we got to do what we feel led to do and
[43:25] we're thankful for the freedoms that men
[43:27] and women died for praise God so we want
[43:31] to look at this here I'll just call it
[43:33] take inside with Jesus and as you as you
[43:35] as you listen to this first half a lot
[43:39] of things become clear about what's
[43:42] going on today in the message and then a
[43:45] lot of things become clear just about
[43:46] brother branham's own doctrine how it's
[43:48] been he you know he grew in his
[43:50] understanding
[43:51] he had progressive revelation and I want
[43:54] to go through those too so I'll try to
[43:56] get through maybe half today so I copied
[43:58] and pasted the entire portion it's it's
[44:01] 13 pages of just plain text
[44:05] but I won't i won't preach all that but
[44:07] i just want to go through it because i
[44:09] think it's really important i think you
[44:10] can see a lot of truce here and now you
[44:14] know anybody if anybody in here could
[44:17] tell about all the the attempts satan
[44:20] has had to try to discourage the church
[44:22] and probably sister Karen because she's
[44:23] lived through a lot of it and I sat down
[44:26] with her in Loris one time years ago we
[44:28] talked about it but they they've seen
[44:30] since the beginning you know the
[44:32] nineteen seventy seven people fall away
[44:33] from that prediction they they just left
[44:35] the message a lot of people left just
[44:36] totally and then through the 80s you
[44:38] know you had different groups rise up
[44:40] the seven thunders group which they said
[44:43] they said the statue perfectman was the
[44:46] seven thunders but that was the wrong
[44:48] interpretation and they started
[44:50] worshiping the leader of that move to
[44:53] the point where after he died they they
[44:55] sat around waiting him for a resurrect
[44:57] there was a prophecy saying he would
[44:59] resurrect from New York and he never did
[45:01] then you had the parousia move of the
[45:03] 80's and 90's as well where Purusha is a
[45:06] Greek word that means his coming and
[45:08] it's a Greek word from the Bible the
[45:11] Lord's coming well a group rose up in
[45:13] Ohio
[45:15] the Manson's passed on
[45:17] when a group rose up and said the Lord's
[45:20] already come and they looked at the
[45:22] cloud of 63 and said the Lord already
[45:24] came there in other words and I don't
[45:27] know how far they took that but some
[45:28] people have taken that that quote at
[45:30] understanding not quote understanding
[45:32] and they said the rapture Artie took
[45:35] place and so they say there's no more
[45:37] need to fast no more need to pray and
[45:39] they live like heathens that they don't
[45:43] have any devotion to Christ now that in
[45:46] particular Church of Ohio didn't do that
[45:47] but they believed because they said this
[45:49] because Christ already came we don't
[45:51] need Holy Ghost anymore we don't need
[45:53] people to pray and speak in tongues or
[45:55] prophesy miracles they said we don't
[45:57] need anybody to shout in the services
[45:59] because these they said he's already
[46:01] here so they don't need it and that's
[46:04] wrong that's of the devil the Bible said
[46:07] quench not the Holy Spirit praise God
[46:10] amen and so see Satan's whole job is to
[46:15] try to get the true believer off the the
[46:18] genuine Reb elation of Jesus Christ amen
[46:21] and it's gonna be a small group that
[46:23] stays right with this word but I'm happy
[46:26] to be one of them today praise God we're
[46:28] a group I believe that's staying with
[46:30] the Word of God all the way praise God I
[46:33] believe that with all my heart if I
[46:35] didn't like I'll reprogram says if I did
[46:37] it I would go join the church that was
[46:39] if I believe there was a church that was
[46:42] more on the word I'd go join them I
[46:43] would it's hard being a pastor preaching
[46:46] all these times it's not easy I'd much
[46:48] rather it be a lot easier to sit under
[46:50] another faster and just preach once a
[46:53] month or be a lot easier but if there
[46:56] was another group that I believe had
[46:57] more truth bang I'd go join them you and
[47:00] I'd say brother let's go join them we're
[47:01] the trustees let's close down the church
[47:04] let's go join them but it's never been
[47:06] that way I believe there's churches that
[47:08] have the equal revelation we have I
[47:10] don't believe anybody ascends above our
[47:12] revelation like we've missed something
[47:14] or something like that I believe we're
[47:16] being fed manna from heaven praise God
[47:18] angels food praise the Lord things the
[47:22] Angels have desired to look into Peter
[47:24] said this new this new covenant the new
[47:27] New Testament revelation I believe God's
[47:29] giving us that praise God why do you I
[47:32] pray for it every before every service I
[47:34] pray for it for 30 minutes that's why I
[47:36] believe we're getting it I believe
[47:38] that's the right thing to do praise God
[47:40] we have to bring our oil to the house of
[47:42] God we know that but if anybody could
[47:45] see it of course it'd be sister Karen
[47:47] and
[47:48] now since I've come in the message the
[47:50] biggest wins have been against
[47:52] Jeffersonville in 2001 there's a move
[47:55] about the copyright and
[47:57] it almost went to court about who can
[48:01] make tapes
[48:02] both sides one side was saying only we
[48:05] can make tapes and the other side's
[48:06] saying anybody can make tapes and it
[48:09] almost went to court but then the side
[48:11] dropped the lawsuit it was trying to
[48:15] control now look at that church there's
[48:17] either two spirits these are the Holy
[48:18] Spirit or there's a Antichrist spirit
[48:22] just watch that and then in 2008 there's
[48:26] a great dispute about who was the
[48:27] absolute was it brother Branham or the
[48:29] word
[48:30] and it's the word praise God brother we
[48:33] saw last week program is pointing to the
[48:35] absolute praise God any man born in sin
[48:37] is not the absolute he's pointing to the
[48:40] absolute praise God Amen it's hard for
[48:43] people to understand that but that's
[48:45] because they don't pray enough praise
[48:46] God that's because they don't love God
[48:48] enough they don't read their Bibles
[48:49] enough to know that Jesus Christ is the
[48:52] only absolute praise the Lord they don't
[48:54] even listen to the tapes enough they
[48:56] only I don't know which tapes are
[48:57] listening to but it's not the tapes that
[48:59] we've been given praise God because all
[49:02] the tapes say Jesus Christ is the one
[49:04] the only absolute there's no other
[49:06] absolutes there could be no other one
[49:07] praise God and
[49:09] then in 2015 the tape church movement
[49:12] started I'm sorry I skipped 2012 was the
[49:14] believe the sign move anyone that had
[49:17] any questions
[49:18] or anyone that doubted brother Brandon
[49:20] as a prophet they left they still leave
[49:23] a little bit that was 2012 that's I call
[49:27] that the apostasy but I say that with
[49:29] kindness in my heart I I love those
[49:31] people I try to talk them back into it
[49:33] praise God but that was 2012 then 2015
[49:36] the tape church movement started saying
[49:38] that we've got to sit down pastors need
[49:40] to they can still pass her but they
[49:42] shouldn't preach as much they should
[49:43] play tapes and that's been the latest
[49:45] move around the message of those two
[49:48] those are the wins that I've seen blow
[49:50] through recently and
[49:55] so we have to be very careful after
[49:58] watch as the years go on if the Lord
[50:00] tarries we just have to see which we
[50:02] have to see which moves which winds are
[50:05] blowing through and we have to look at
[50:07] it and we have to stay what was the
[50:09] romance oh you have to discern the two
[50:11] spirits within the framework of the
[50:13] church and if you're able to withstand
[50:15] the Antichrist spirit he said you'll be
[50:17] an invincible army praise God amen he
[50:21] didn't say he'd be a huge army he said
[50:22] you'd be invincible praise God hey I
[50:25] think we never claimed to be big as far
[50:28] as numbers but we claim to be invincible
[50:29] with God's Word in our hand praise God
[50:32] because what devil can stand before the
[50:35] anointed Word of God amen the Bible said
[50:38] the demons tremble at the name of Jesus
[50:40] Christ amen the Word of God so we have
[50:44] nothing fear about because perfect love
[50:47] casts out all fear amen but we have to
[50:50] stand we have to pray we have to stay
[50:52] true to God's holy word and
[50:55] so we shall by God's grace now let me
[50:59] begin here I want to just I won't be
[51:01] reading all the quotes but the ones I
[51:03] felt led to the Lord and kind of want to
[51:06] emphasize here
[51:08] so Ram says it plainly says we're going
[51:11] to start off with the early church and I
[51:14] can show you the vision I have for the
[51:17] future so if anyone wants to know what
[51:20] was brother branham's vision for his
[51:22] message if anyone wants to know right
[51:25] here taking sides with Jesus you have to
[51:27] wonder what did brother Ram want the
[51:28] brother man want Joseph to come and take
[51:30] over Billy Paul Rebecca Sarah who did he
[51:32] want to take over
[51:34] did he want anybody to take over
[51:37] there's no there's no there's no
[51:40] wondering about it at all brother man
[51:41] lays it completely out on the tapes
[51:44] praise God and
[51:46] to make sure we know whatever he would
[51:49] say it'd have to be the same thing Paul
[51:51] already said in God's Word
[51:54] because my RAM can't add one thing to
[51:56] what Paul said neither could Paul Paul
[51:58] said though we or an angel he said let
[52:02] it be cursed if if any person tries to
[52:06] change one word of Paul's gospel or this
[52:09] Holy Bible the Bible said they're cursed
[52:12] and may be temporary it may be a long
[52:15] time curse
[52:18] but we must not change one thing and he
[52:22] says we begin at Pentecost where the
[52:24] church was inaugurated the Holy Ghost
[52:27] found them he said and I believe all
[52:29] these things have a time of lingering
[52:31] waiting it's waiting for the time of the
[52:33] scripture to be filled fulfilled he said
[52:35] everything in order waiting he said many
[52:38] times we get impatient just like a child
[52:40] how many could say amen to that I get
[52:43] impatient right we all get impatient he
[52:45] said but he said we have great
[52:48] anticipations and many times we jump way
[52:50] ahead and that just hinders the work
[52:53] until the work gets caught up see we
[52:55] must just move reverently have a purpose
[52:57] in heart thank God if he would desire to
[53:01] use us and such as such away but wait
[53:03] till he makes the opening because he has
[53:06] got to go ahead of us and many of these
[53:09] moves that sister Karen has seen and
[53:11] I've seen a couple preachers they'll get
[53:13] a little thought and and what they'll do
[53:16] is they'll get a head of the Holy Spirit
[53:18] like with the thought about the seven
[53:20] thunders I mean that let's go it was all
[53:23] preparing them for the rapture they
[53:25] thought you know the because brother
[53:26] Aaron says the thunders will prepare us
[53:28] though the thunders will be revealed
[53:30] about the time of the rapture now we
[53:32] know he corrected that later he correct
[53:34] that and said the funders was the
[53:36] revelations in the seven seals he
[53:39] corrected that later but see they get
[53:41] one little thought and they try to make
[53:43] a big doctrine of it and they jump ahead
[53:45] that what if they really wanted at the
[53:46] beginning to see the rapture and they
[53:48] thought by preaching those seven
[53:50] thunders they would get the rapture but
[53:52] they didn't get it praise God they got
[53:54] ahead of the move of God amen we don't
[53:58] want to get ahead we don't want to fall
[53:59] behind we want to stay right in the
[54:01] middle of God's moon I
[54:04] want to walk in the light praise God not
[54:08] in front not behind how to walk in the
[54:10] line as he's in the light praise God and
[54:14] so see it's it's an impatience and
[54:17] especially in preachers our men get
[54:19] impatient and they try to exalt their
[54:22] false doctrine and they get ahead of the
[54:25] plan of God happens all the time but
[54:28] brother man said member David before he
[54:30] went out he waited till he felt the Holy
[54:32] Spirit in the mulberry trees
[54:34] the Holy Spirit manifested as a natural
[54:37] wind did it not and it blew and the
[54:40] mulberry bushes and David said now I can
[54:41] go out and I can repossess all all that
[54:43] I lost for he's God so though Graham
[54:45] says you a he said before you do
[54:47] anything wait till you see the Holy
[54:49] Spirit move praise God
[54:52] wait till you see the leadership or the
[54:54] Holy Spirit in our lives then we move
[54:57] upon the scene that's why you as a
[54:59] Christian Church it's so easy I
[55:00] shouldn't say easy it can be so easy
[55:03] just to do God's perfect will because
[55:05] you don't do anything until you know
[55:07] God's told you to do it
[55:09] it can be what I mean is it can be very
[55:12] simple to stay in God's perfect will if
[55:14] we want to be true to God if we want to
[55:16] be the bride it can be very easy just
[55:18] don't do it until you know for sure
[55:20] brings God weight do you see God
[55:23] supernaturally
[55:24] move and then go with it praise God
[55:27] amen
[55:31] it's such an important lesson that we
[55:33] need to be patient and no reason why
[55:35] they didn't you know why they're
[55:36] impatient because they never grew up on
[55:38] their stature perfect man because that's
[55:39] part of that's part of God's building
[55:42] and amen faith virtue knowledge patience
[55:44] praise God they never they never went
[55:47] all with God they never stayed in the
[55:49] truth of God so they can never be built
[55:51] up to have enough patience to really
[55:54] stay with God's Word
[55:57] nah
[55:59] but manna said if we only do that
[56:01] brethren knowing the battle must come
[56:04] but we must wait to see the hand of God
[56:07] going before us to make away
[56:10] now brown lays it out next paul
[56:13] established new churches and ordained
[56:16] pastors now we read that in let's go to
[56:20] acts 14 let's keep your place there acts
[56:21] 14 let's read that again by God's grace
[56:30] because brother Branham will say it
[56:32] plainly
[56:33] his vision is to continue what Paul
[56:37] started not to change one thing now this
[56:42] is Paul's first missionary trip member
[56:44] in chapter 13 I believe it is yea they
[56:46] fasted and prayed with the preachers and
[56:49] the prophets and the teachers and the
[56:50] Holy Ghost said separate me Paul
[56:52] Barnabas for the work I've called them
[56:54] to do and they went out on their first
[56:56] missionary trip Paul had tremendous
[56:58] success
[56:59] that's when the Jews blast fiend and
[57:01] said and then Paul said fine we shook
[57:04] ourselves of the dust and we say from
[57:06] henceforth we go to the Gentiles Paul
[57:08] tried he tried to go to the Jews
[57:10] you know just because of his love but
[57:12] then because they blaspheme he went to
[57:14] the Gentiles now chapter 14 they're
[57:17] working Iconium and Derbe and Lystra
[57:20] they have a great miracle at Lystra the
[57:23] impotent man is healed they try to
[57:25] worship but he gives all the glory to
[57:27] Christ and now verse 23 is what we read
[57:31] actually a scope - 21
[57:34] X 14 21 and when they had preached the
[57:37] gospel to that city and had taught many
[57:39] they returned again to Lystra and
[57:40] Iconium and Antioch confirming the souls
[57:43] of the disciples and exhorting them to
[57:45] continue in the faith that we must
[57:47] through much tribulation enter to the
[57:50] kingdom of God can you imagine they
[57:51] started all these churches and then they
[57:53] would move on and then come back and say
[57:56] now listen we're back housing how's the
[57:58] picnic going is that what he said how
[58:00] was the picnic going is everybody is
[58:02] everybody enjoying the Millenium is that
[58:05] what he said no he said through much
[58:07] tribulation you're gonna fight you're
[58:10] like loaves I'm sorry you're like sheep
[58:12] among wolves right he told them you must
[58:16] go through Great Tribulation if you want
[58:18] to be a part of the kingdom of God how
[58:20] many willing to fight praise God how
[58:22] many willing to endure hardship remember
[58:25] Paul told Timothy endure hardship it's
[58:28] going to be hard people are going to
[58:29] come against you at every hand but you
[58:31] must endure hardship in order to be a
[58:34] part of the kingdom of God
[58:37] verse 23 and when they had ordained them
[58:40] elders in every city and then pray with
[58:42] fasting they commended them to the Lord
[58:44] on whom they believed
[58:46] see that to pray and fast say God show
[58:49] us which man is your God called man
[58:52] which man will be the man that will
[58:54] Shepherd the people and only preach them
[58:57] your word and then they before he left
[59:00] he'd ordained that person the Holy
[59:01] Spirit would mutt made it known to him
[59:03] he ordained that man the pastor verse 24
[59:06] and after that passed through throughout
[59:08] beside iya they came to Pamphylia and
[59:11] when they had preached the word in purga
[59:13] they went down into italia and that
[59:15] sailed to Antioch from whence they had
[59:17] been recommended to the grace of God for
[59:19] the work which they fulfilled when they
[59:22] were come together and gather the church
[59:24] together they rehearse all that God had
[59:26] done what a testimony meeting brother
[59:27] Wow what a testimony meeting praise God
[59:30] rehearse all that God had done and how
[59:33] he had opened the door of faith unto the
[59:35] Gentiles and
[59:36] they abode long time with the disciples
[59:39] I
[59:40] wonder if he rehearsed earlier in the
[59:42] chapter where he told the man who never
[59:44] walked rise up on your feet in the name
[59:46] of Jesus Christ amen
[59:48] what a testimony meeting praise God he
[59:52] would establish the churches spend a few
[59:55] years on the trip and come back to where
[59:57] he started
[1:00:00] that's what brother BAM said he said
[1:00:03] wherever Paul went the Lord led him and
[1:00:05] established a church and when they
[1:00:07] preached the message and many was
[1:00:09] converted if he left the people in that
[1:00:13] condition they would wander right back
[1:00:14] out into their pagan gods in the Judaism
[1:00:17] whatever more because the people had no
[1:00:19] one to teach them the converse had no
[1:00:21] place to go so Paul established churches
[1:00:23] in different parts of the countries and
[1:00:26] each of these churches left someone who
[1:00:28] is in order a man that was trustworthy a
[1:00:30] man that was known as a pastor a
[1:00:32] shepherd or that after this church
[1:00:34] became other little churches come out of
[1:00:36] it young men and old men raised up and
[1:00:39] become churches out of that the man that
[1:00:40] was over the first church was called the
[1:00:42] bishop and then he and his that went out
[1:00:44] of him his children were called
[1:00:46] Shepherds or pastors and then this group
[1:00:48] of little churches all come back to this
[1:00:50] Bishop now go to first Timothy 3
[1:00:54] Bishop is a Bible word now the
[1:00:56] denomination steal it and they make a
[1:00:58] lot of evil
[1:01:00] lordship with it but it is a Bible word
[1:01:03] Bishop is like the pastor and people use
[1:01:07] it you know to exalt people and it's not
[1:01:10] right but it's a godly word it means
[1:01:12] overseer
[1:01:14] first Timothy 3:1 this is a true saying
[1:01:17] if a man desire the office of a bishop
[1:01:19] he desireth a good work a bishop then
[1:01:22] must be blameless the husband of one
[1:01:24] wife vigilant sober of good behavior
[1:01:27] given the hospitality apt to teach so he
[1:01:30] should be very able just to teach
[1:01:32] praise the Lord Amen
[1:01:34] so see the word bishop it just means
[1:01:37] another word for pastor doesn't mean the
[1:01:39] same but it has the same idea its
[1:01:42] overseer and a pastor as a shepherd a
[1:01:44] feeder oversees sheep so Bishop is a
[1:01:48] Bible word and
[1:01:50] so we don't want to think there's a
[1:01:53] wrong with the word Bishop what's wrong
[1:01:55] is when men try to lord over men that's
[1:01:58] what's wrong when you get a
[1:01:58] denominational bishop praise God now
[1:02:01] brother him said this
[1:02:04] now let me just say this - I've always
[1:02:06] thought - if God ever raised up another
[1:02:09] Church in Akron I would not be let's say
[1:02:11] it's far away I don't know where far
[1:02:12] would be an acrobat if it's too far away
[1:02:14] I wouldn't I would not be against two
[1:02:15] different churches in Akron I would not
[1:02:17] be against that I don't I'm not I don't
[1:02:19] know I don't have to be the pastor of
[1:02:21] all Akron
[1:02:22] because if a church Springs out another
[1:02:25] church it could be God right now usually
[1:02:29] it's not a good idea but there I mean
[1:02:30] there are cities that have to message
[1:02:32] churches in them and they're good Holy
[1:02:33] Ghost filled churches and they can have
[1:02:35] a good fellowship look at Lima look at
[1:02:38] Loraine good good godly churches right
[1:02:42] multiple churches in one city but yet
[1:02:45] they still have fellowship and unity
[1:02:47] that's how all the Christian churches
[1:02:48] should be we should all have unity we
[1:02:51] shouldn't have any competition or any
[1:02:53] backbiting or any religious spirits on
[1:02:57] that manner
[1:02:58] now buh-bam says i rainiest carried on
[1:03:01] the same thing paul did Martin carried
[1:03:05] on the same thing Polycarp carried on
[1:03:07] the same thing right down through the
[1:03:09] age
[1:03:09] he said that was Paul and when Paul left
[1:03:13] John took over the church and when John
[1:03:14] left Polycarp then Polycarp Iranians and
[1:03:17] on down Martin and so forth and both
[1:03:20] ever said no God promised to restore
[1:03:22] again that same thing how did it get
[1:03:26] praise God oh it makes me happy because
[1:03:28] brother Graham came out of
[1:03:30] Jeffersonville all right and out of him
[1:03:33] came ventually brother Brooks and I came
[1:03:35] out of brother Brooks and cam came out
[1:03:37] of our church cams Church now so see
[1:03:39] it's the same thing God's doing the same
[1:03:41] thing today hallelujah one out of
[1:03:45] another God promised to restore that
[1:03:48] same setup you know there's a church
[1:03:50] there's a brother that came out of cams
[1:03:52] Church very nice brother but he came out
[1:03:57] in the wrong way and bang might know
[1:03:59] what I'm talking about I'm not speaking
[1:04:01] bad but I'm just showing you the example
[1:04:02] he came out of cam Church start his own
[1:04:04] church and guess who ordained him his
[1:04:07] dad not even a preacher that right there
[1:04:10] breaks the apostolic order of God's
[1:04:13] church God's church is for the lead the
[1:04:16] pastor if a church Springs out of his he
[1:04:19] needs to go ordain that man as the
[1:04:21] pastor and that's where his sovereignty
[1:04:24] ends now that passed with a new church
[1:04:26] now he is a sovereign leader over that
[1:04:29] church by the Holy Spirit amen not a
[1:04:31] denomination but a living organism
[1:04:34] praise God
[1:04:36] and so man might know who I'm talking
[1:04:38] about and cam has met with that brother
[1:04:41] since and the brother even apologized
[1:04:42] sister Karen and said I hope God can
[1:04:44] have forgive me on this because I didn't
[1:04:46] do it the Apostolic way that's why it's
[1:04:48] so important that brother Brooks
[1:04:49] ordained me as a pastor here right we
[1:04:53] have the special meetings right he
[1:04:54] ordained me and it's everybody knew that
[1:04:56] this man of God is anointing another man
[1:05:00] of God a faithful man to preach his word
[1:05:02] to preach God's Word amen and
[1:05:05] he's Jesus said or Joel said I will
[1:05:09] restore the same thing Paul did I'll
[1:05:11] restore that and we're seeing it today
[1:05:13] Church we're living in the days of the
[1:05:15] fulfilling of God's Word amen just us
[1:05:18] meeting every day every every weekend
[1:05:21] multiple times a week and then keeping
[1:05:23] this apostolic pattern we're fulfilling
[1:05:25] prophecy we're a part of Joel's prophecy
[1:05:28] amen now we all want to see the rapture
[1:05:31] part but hold on we'll get to that by
[1:05:33] God's grace let's do the Apostolic part
[1:05:36] first and then if we're faithful with
[1:05:39] that then we'll be faithful for the
[1:05:40] rapture
[1:05:43] thank the Lord as her brother and said
[1:05:46] God promised to restore that same nation
[1:05:48] again
[1:05:51] now look what brother Aaron says I want
[1:05:53] to read this for our sake and your sake
[1:05:55] listen well BAM said I believe there's
[1:05:58] not too much
[1:06:00] he said that would break this thing my
[1:06:03] interpret my interpretation may be wrong
[1:06:05] in the scriptures that Jesus could not
[1:06:07] come tonight I believe what little is
[1:06:09] left to be fulfilled could be fulfilled
[1:06:11] before daylight in the morning
[1:06:15] now look what he's saying he's saying
[1:06:17] Road RAM saying there's so little to be
[1:06:19] fulfilled in the scripture
[1:06:20] Jesus Christ could come in the morning
[1:06:23] right but look what he says next he said
[1:06:28] and I may be wrong on the time of that
[1:06:31] but it's at hand I believe it
[1:06:35] everybody with me
[1:06:37] program says there's there's hardly a
[1:06:39] and there's numerous quotes where boban
[1:06:42] says there's nothing to be fulfilled
[1:06:43] left there's very little be filled left
[1:06:45] and people will major on those quotes
[1:06:47] but I wanted to show you this program
[1:06:49] says right here I could be wrong
[1:06:52] and I think I by God's grace I believe
[1:06:55] from brother Graham's other sermons
[1:06:57] there's at least two scriptures to be
[1:06:59] fulfilled
[1:07:00] from pick up your pen and write brother
[1:07:02] Aaron said revelation 13:6 t the the
[1:07:05] Antichrist system will force the bride
[1:07:08] to stop preaching that was written when
[1:07:11] he said pick up your pen and write and
[1:07:12] it's revelation 13:16 and then
[1:07:16] revelation 3:10 because you've kept the
[1:07:18] word of my patience I'll keep you from
[1:07:20] the hour of temptation which will come
[1:07:22] upon to try them all that are on the
[1:07:25] earth
[1:07:25] so see brothers rogram whoa he'll say
[1:07:28] quotes where there's nothing left to be
[1:07:30] fulfilled but yet here he says I could
[1:07:32] be wrong on it but I know it's near I
[1:07:35] didn't hear praise God
[1:07:39] now why do I get so happy because I know
[1:07:41] so many preachers brother bang that go
[1:07:43] overboard and they won't hear any other
[1:07:45] quotes and the quotes they believe and
[1:07:47] then then they get this quote they won't
[1:07:49] even look at it see that's a lack of
[1:07:51] humility if we're humble that means we
[1:07:54] can learn more if we're humble that
[1:07:57] means we can be corrected praise God
[1:08:01] and that's what we want to be I want to
[1:08:04] be humble I want to be corrected if I'm
[1:08:06] wrong praise God
[1:08:08] but look at he says I may be wrong on
[1:08:11] the time of that fulfilling but I know
[1:08:12] it's near I
[1:08:14] hear ya praise God
[1:08:17] bro Graham said what if God would have
[1:08:19] told John the Revelator now it's going
[1:08:22] to be 2,000 years before my coming but
[1:08:26] BAM said John might have went back and
[1:08:27] been discouraged and told the church he
[1:08:29] said well I guess we might as well eat
[1:08:31] drink and be merry because there's going
[1:08:33] to be many durations
[1:08:36] brother bam sense of humor he said see
[1:08:39] Jesus ain't coming for 2,000 years see
[1:08:41] he said the church would have been loose
[1:08:44] if you and I knew the day or hour we
[1:08:47] might be kind of loose until like the
[1:08:49] week before praise God
[1:08:52] if you knew you had a couple more years
[1:08:54] oh well then I always wanted to buy that
[1:08:56] always want to travel there
[1:08:58] there's nothing wrong we wouldn't travel
[1:09:00] here hoping
[1:09:02] God on purpose God doesn't tell us
[1:09:05] because he doesn't want us to live for
[1:09:07] today he doesn't want us to live loosely
[1:09:10] spiritually but man said he wants us to
[1:09:12] be on the mark praise God he wants us
[1:09:15] focused on one target and he wants us to
[1:09:17] hit that target being prepared keeping
[1:09:20] her hearts clean for the coming of the
[1:09:22] Lord the Bible said we must be blameless
[1:09:24] he will preserve us blameless under the
[1:09:27] coming of the Lord praise God
[1:09:31] so it's a good point
[1:09:34] everyone must live like Jesus is coming
[1:09:36] and then right after that is the quote
[1:09:38] that ties him with brother amens dream
[1:09:40] he had that dream where Jesus said I'm
[1:09:43] coming now remember that Abraham says
[1:09:46] and taking sides of Jesus we've got to
[1:09:49] be looking for him coming right now even
[1:09:51] God
[1:09:52] I wondered what that dream was about
[1:09:55] well now I know cuz brother man says
[1:09:58] when you get a reality of Jesus Christ
[1:10:00] you live like he's coming now praise God
[1:10:03] hey man that's what that means amen I
[1:10:06] told you another one it could be it were
[1:10:09] now in the season the rapture if that's
[1:10:11] possible but I know for sure this is the
[1:10:14] right River at least one of the
[1:10:15] revelations of it
[1:10:17] you see God didn't tell John it's going
[1:10:20] to be 2000 years and remember all the
[1:10:23] disciples were around John because
[1:10:25] supposedly Jesus said he's not going to
[1:10:28] taste death though he sees the Lord's
[1:10:29] coming which was true but not physically
[1:10:32] it was the vision that he saw John saw
[1:10:35] Jesus is coming on Mount Transfiguration
[1:10:38] that's what Jesus meant but the people
[1:10:40] misunderstood it they misunderstood what
[1:10:42] the Prophet said all we see that a lot
[1:10:44] today
[1:10:45] they misunderstand what the Prophet said
[1:10:47] but those who are born again will catch
[1:10:50] the revelation of it
[1:10:52] that's right because they got the Holy
[1:10:55] Ghost the Holy Ghost will guide us into
[1:10:57] all truth
[1:11:00] that's exactly right
[1:11:04] so see all these statements rubberband
[1:11:07] makes everyone has got to be taken back
[1:11:09] to the word well Ram said he said try me
[1:11:12] he said he said it's come to the time
[1:11:14] where everything I've said has got to be
[1:11:16] either proven right or wrong he said
[1:11:19] because the Bible said prove all things
[1:11:20] hey
[1:11:22] hallelujah
[1:11:25] so God used taken sighs with Jesus to
[1:11:28] show me a men's prayer or a men's dream
[1:11:30] what that mean it means that we got to
[1:11:33] be looking for right now look for me now
[1:11:37] live like he's coming now I
[1:11:42] says this next brother now to carry on
[1:11:47] we've got to put footprints here on the
[1:11:49] sands of time that others can see if
[1:11:51] John haven't went I'm sorry if Paul
[1:11:54] hadn't went on the way he did then John
[1:11:56] wouldn't have known how to follow if
[1:11:59] John hadn't went on Polycarp would not
[1:12:02] have known how to follow if Polycarp
[1:12:04] when I went on a radius would have known
[1:12:05] how to follow if I radius would have
[1:12:07] went on Martin would have known how to
[1:12:09] follow see what I mean each one has to
[1:12:11] put footprints on the sands of time
[1:12:16] see Church the same Holy Ghost baptism
[1:12:19] that led those men and let me say like
[1:12:23] this without cell phones
[1:12:25] without Paul's sermons right right in
[1:12:28] their pocket where's mine
[1:12:30] they didn't have all Paul's words in
[1:12:32] their pocket like we got oh let me see
[1:12:34] if brother Ian didn't say that real
[1:12:36] quick let me check here they couldn't do
[1:12:38] that they had to pack backpacks of
[1:12:40] scrolls and my can you imagine all the
[1:12:42] scrolls they would have to carry
[1:12:45] and
[1:12:46] so see it shows that the strength that's
[1:12:51] going to keep us in the truth is not a
[1:12:54] natural thing it's a spiritual thing
[1:12:56] praise God another words the funny ghost
[1:12:59] field the proof that Jesus lives in you
[1:13:02] is not a physical proof it's a spiritual
[1:13:05] revelation it's God's presence in your
[1:13:08] soul
[1:13:14] you know I've been debating with this in
[1:13:16] a nice way this message believer from
[1:13:18] overseas all week he's didn't like my
[1:13:20] video on Jesus Christ is the absolute of
[1:13:22] brother Graham he didn't like that one
[1:13:23] at all and we finally came down to the
[1:13:25] end this morning I'm like brother I said
[1:13:27] I'm done I'm done talking about this
[1:13:28] you're not gonna convince me either way
[1:13:30] you didn't either I'm not gonna convince
[1:13:31] you
[1:13:32] but his last question was will then
[1:13:34] brother Jesse if the tapes are not all
[1:13:37] absolute and infallible then who is
[1:13:40] going to judge what's inspired and
[1:13:43] what's not inspired
[1:13:45] and I said brother the same thing that
[1:13:49] they used in the days of Paul to judge
[1:13:51] is the same thing we're going to use
[1:13:53] today it's the Holy Ghost praise God
[1:13:56] amen it's never changed it's the same
[1:14:00] thing that they that Paul Iranians
[1:14:03] Polycarp Martin Martin Luther all those
[1:14:05] godly men the same thing they had to
[1:14:07] judge what's right or wrong is the same
[1:14:10] thing we do it's God's Holy Spirit it
[1:14:13] never changed praise God but they think
[1:14:16] it's checking on their Apple and make
[1:14:18] another and say that would not so don't
[1:14:20] get me wrong we respect that we do that
[1:14:22] we do want to check back but the way to
[1:14:25] know you're right is that the Holy
[1:14:27] Spirit promised jesus said the reason
[1:14:30] I'm leaving is so you'll have me on the
[1:14:32] inside praise God to guide you into all
[1:14:36] truth praise God and
[1:14:39] that's the same thing Jose's not here
[1:14:41] but it's the same thing with Jose and
[1:14:43] William and Aaron and I sat in voice of
[1:14:46] God's office it came down to that well
[1:14:49] then brother Jesse he said how do you
[1:14:51] know what's inspired and what's not and
[1:14:53] I said brother the gift of God the
[1:14:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost in my heart
[1:14:58] tells me because it was sent for me the
[1:15:00] gift is to help me rightly divide it
[1:15:02] praise God
[1:15:04] and I said brother I says all right so I
[1:15:06] told her brother this morning on the
[1:15:07] text I said brother if I'm wrong if
[1:15:09] that's wrong well then I'll go teach the
[1:15:11] church too pray to the third person of
[1:15:14] the Trinity today like brother Brandon
[1:15:17] he said no no brother don't do that I
[1:15:20] won't do that to you but I'm I'm making
[1:15:23] a point
[1:15:24] there's a time brother Ram thought the
[1:15:26] Trinity was okay he called Jesus the
[1:15:28] second person the Trinity he said father
[1:15:31] I pray the third person attorney will
[1:15:34] come down and reveal your word to their
[1:15:36] hearts
[1:15:39] these people I
[1:15:42] don't know why sister Karen they just
[1:15:44] want to worship something anyone worship
[1:15:45] a man they want to worship something
[1:15:47] other than God Almighty praise God but
[1:15:50] not you and I we are going to worship
[1:15:51] one and only person the absolute person
[1:15:54] the eternal person the invisible person
[1:15:57] the Lord Jesus Christ amen yea I became
[1:16:00] visible I know that too but his real
[1:16:02] person is invisible
[1:16:04] because he's the invisible God Jesus
[1:16:07] Christ is the image of the invisible God
[1:16:09] but the invisible God is his spirit
[1:16:11] praise God
[1:16:14] see so what is my wife shared it with me
[1:16:17] obviously share it with her and she gave
[1:16:18] me a good description this morning she
[1:16:20] said but and I said I said honey they're
[1:16:22] just scared they live in fear and she
[1:16:25] said you know what that's right she said
[1:16:26] Peter said perfect love casts out all
[1:16:29] fear the reason they're worried in
[1:16:31] jeffersonville the reason they're
[1:16:33] worried all these churches I better not
[1:16:34] preach the reason they're worried is
[1:16:37] because they don't have the love of God
[1:16:38] amen but when you've got the love of God
[1:16:41] it gets rid of all your fear praise God
[1:16:44] amen
[1:16:45] when you really love God and gods in
[1:16:48] your soul you're not afraid you've got
[1:16:51] strength you've got power you've got
[1:16:53] confidence because Christ lives in you
[1:16:55] praise God
[1:17:05] so as time goes on we have to Ernest Lee
[1:17:09] contend for the faith that was delivered
[1:17:12] to Paul
[1:17:13] how many believe that
[1:17:15] it's gonna be a earnest fight there's
[1:17:18] gonna be all kinds of isms rise up here
[1:17:19] like I said every couple years another
[1:17:21] one rises up
[1:17:26] today's one is to limit the preaching is
[1:17:29] to make preachers and they and I even
[1:17:32] got the quote that costs make believers
[1:17:34] if we wonder well should the pastor
[1:17:37] preach or play tapes
[1:17:39] they said you're a make believer well
[1:17:42] I'm not a big believer because I don't
[1:17:44] wonder that I don't have any questions
[1:17:46] in my mind about that I know who called
[1:17:48] me to preach it's the one who vindicated
[1:17:50] me why not praise praise God I can't
[1:17:52] vindicate myself Christ came and
[1:17:54] vindicated my word Amen I'm preaching
[1:17:57] his word it ain't my word to begin with
[1:17:59] I have no word that can help anybody
[1:18:00] there's nothing good in me the only good
[1:18:03] thing is Jesus Christ
[1:18:08] and so see they want to take away and
[1:18:10] I've heard him say - I've heard from
[1:18:12] their lips they said brother I've ever
[1:18:13] heard his own family say that brother
[1:18:15] Ram fulfilled all the five fold ministry
[1:18:17] we don't need it anymore that's what
[1:18:18] they said oh they're so close but
[1:18:21] they're so far away
[1:18:22] they're close and the fact that brother
[1:18:25] Branham could have all five gifts but
[1:18:28] they're so far away saying he fulfilled
[1:18:30] them and we don't need them anymore
[1:18:31] they're so close but so far away
[1:18:35] let me prove that to you because it's
[1:18:37] scriptural I think I got it down here I
[1:18:41] just want to show it here
[1:18:46] there it is 1st Timothy 2 let's go there
[1:18:48] 1st Timothy 2
[1:18:50] first Timothy 2:7
[1:18:56] the church we can prove that Paul had at
[1:19:01] least three of the five gifts of the
[1:19:04] fivefold ministry just by scripture and
[1:19:06] then by common sense you can see he had
[1:19:08] the other ones too
[1:19:10] look at verse yeah first Timothy 2:7
[1:19:13] we're on - I am ordained a preacher and
[1:19:16] in a apostle I speak the truth in Christ
[1:19:19] and lie not a teacher of the Gentiles in
[1:19:22] faith and Verity so by his own words
[1:19:27] he says I'm apostle and I'm teacher well
[1:19:32] 1st Thessalonians 4 says I speak to you
[1:19:35] in the name of the Lord that the dead in
[1:19:36] Christ will rise first amen he gives
[1:19:39] prophecy so he's a prophet and then
[1:19:42] brother Ram said he was the first pastor
[1:19:44] in Ephesus right and the last one
[1:19:47] evangelist he hadn't been advantageous
[1:19:49] because evangelist goes to churches that
[1:19:51] are already established
[1:19:52] right and just straight that's what
[1:19:55] evangelist does he brings us fire he
[1:19:56] sets a fire in the church that's already
[1:19:58] started and then leaves town
[1:20:00] but see a missionary he goes there stays
[1:20:04] there gets a say so for a little bit
[1:20:06] sets it in order and then he leaves and
[1:20:08] he ordains a pastor over there before he
[1:20:11] leaves so that people don't wander back
[1:20:13] into sin right they don't wander out
[1:20:15] into denominations and or organizations
[1:20:17] and things like that
[1:20:18] so can everybody see that is that clear
[1:20:21] they're so close brother Ram did have
[1:20:24] all five but he didn't do away with them
[1:20:28] all right just want to share that with
[1:20:31] you hope that was okay by God's grace I
[1:20:32] know it's okay I shouldn't say that I
[1:20:34] know I know it's alright no one's gonna
[1:20:37] bawl me out after service for preaching
[1:20:39] that I know that
[1:20:40] okay now here's my brother Ram says well
[1:20:44] if I thought there was a denomination or
[1:20:46] any other group of believers that had
[1:20:48] anything better than what we have here I
[1:20:51] would want to merge this little body
[1:20:54] with it right quick I said the same
[1:20:56] thing look how home over the RAM was if
[1:20:59] there was a church that had more
[1:21:00] revelation I'd go merge my church with
[1:21:02] theirs but there wasn't
[1:21:06] same thing I believe if there's someone
[1:21:08] more correct with more of the word and
[1:21:10] more anything let's go join them
[1:21:14] but where we going to go
[1:21:16] we want it we want a church here for our
[1:21:19] family praise God we want to church here
[1:21:22] because it's close to us praise God we
[1:21:24] want that
[1:21:25] we want to church here because nobody
[1:21:27] else is fishing here praised it there
[1:21:30] should be there's some more chances to
[1:21:31] go fishing here praise God
[1:21:33] hallelujah
[1:21:36] that's what we feel led to do and so far
[1:21:39] it's been vindicated by the souls that
[1:21:40] have been saved praise God that's right
[1:21:43] and
[1:21:45] then brother M goes to his own ministry
[1:21:48] he goes back to the fifties where he
[1:21:50] went to Bombay and he said Bombay India
[1:21:53] and he there hadn't been at least a
[1:21:55] hundred thousand that gave their lives
[1:21:57] to Christ and he said I had no church
[1:22:01] nothing I could do there was nobody to
[1:22:04] give to them he's talking about
[1:22:05] preachers what would if program could
[1:22:07] give new Congress anything what would he
[1:22:10] give them a preacher a
[1:22:13] preacher
[1:22:15] praise God I knew yeah not his takes a
[1:22:19] preacher take for good we need them but
[1:22:24] the living creatures what will brother
[1:22:26] and one to give him
[1:22:27] he said what can i what could I do
[1:22:30] there's nobody to give to them there
[1:22:33] wasn't even a Pentecostal denomination
[1:22:35] that would cooperate with me and
[1:22:38] he says those souls can you imagine a
[1:22:41] hundred or two hundred thousand he said
[1:22:44] those souls probably drifted right back
[1:22:46] to the shiites the Jains the buddhist
[1:22:48] and whatever they came because there was
[1:22:49] no place to put them now what a shame
[1:22:52] that's a disgrace because I had no
[1:22:54] cooperation because of the stand that I
[1:22:55] take and then he gives an example the
[1:22:57] only church that won that crop rate with
[1:22:59] him was a father son Holy Ghost church
[1:23:01] where they baptized three times face
[1:23:03] forward and three times backward he said
[1:23:05] he said I couldn't have any fellowship
[1:23:07] with them and they do three in the
[1:23:09] father and three in the son and three in
[1:23:11] the Holy Ghost he said how can I
[1:23:13] cooperate with that right now let me
[1:23:16] balance this out too if anybody got the
[1:23:19] Holy Ghost at that meeting there's no
[1:23:21] way they could have went back to
[1:23:22] Hinduism because the Holy Ghost is a
[1:23:24] sealed Saints until the day of
[1:23:27] redemption it seals the desire for sin
[1:23:30] out and it seals holiness in yeah
[1:23:36] so see you got to be out of balance all
[1:23:38] these out because you understand
[1:23:40] programs he's just he's just kind of
[1:23:41] sharing his heart with the people but
[1:23:44] Jesus Jesus said all that the father has
[1:23:47] given me will come praise God and no man
[1:23:51] is able to pluck those predestinated
[1:23:54] souls out of my father's hand
[1:23:58] now the make believers yeah they would
[1:24:00] have wandered right back they just had
[1:24:02] an emotional
[1:24:03] confession I'm giving my heart to Jesus
[1:24:05] and never really died out to themselves
[1:24:07] and really repented yeah they would have
[1:24:09] wanted right back to the Sikhs and the
[1:24:10] Jains
[1:24:11] but not a real experience with Christ
[1:24:21] now brother man gives it a hypothetical
[1:24:24] example
[1:24:25] he says what if brother and I had
[1:24:28] revival here and we got through in a big
[1:24:31] revival you brother and I just got
[1:24:32] converted and there wasn't a Church of
[1:24:34] this type in the country and I've been
[1:24:36] the advantage list and now I'm leaving
[1:24:37] out you may never see me again what
[1:24:39] would you do I
[1:24:41] mean I'm inside this church let me just
[1:24:43] be real real what if the Holy Spirit
[1:24:45] called me to go overseas and I moved
[1:24:47] overseas what would you do
[1:24:51] I'll tell you what you do
[1:24:55] he said you'd be so burned with it till
[1:24:58] one of you lay members Vanger amen
[1:25:02] would feel like starting up a church and
[1:25:05] start preaching it yourself cuz your
[1:25:07] heart would burn for the Word of God and
[1:25:10] you would feel bad for the people that
[1:25:12] left the same way you did now isn't that
[1:25:15] right
[1:25:17] program said you'd feel so bad if you're
[1:25:20] the only man you'd stand up and start
[1:25:22] preaching praise God hey hallelujah
[1:25:25] that's what would happen
[1:25:27] that's what my mam said that's what must
[1:25:29] happen in India people got saved by Ram
[1:25:32] left well I can't go back to the world
[1:25:34] but Ram he even says in this quote we
[1:25:36] can't go back to the Pentecostals where
[1:25:38] they stripped their women and their
[1:25:40] clothes and and watch evil movies and he
[1:25:43] said we can't go back there where are we
[1:25:45] gonna go we'll start our own praise God
[1:25:47] hey
[1:25:48] now don't care if it's small I don't
[1:25:50] care what the word were poor Jesus said
[1:25:53] if there's two or three he's right there
[1:25:55] in church with you praise God hallelujah
[1:26:00] that's why I don't care how loud it is I
[1:26:02] preach like this whether there's a
[1:26:04] hundred people here or I got two people
[1:26:06] here because I know Jesus is here
[1:26:11] Christ is here amen I always preach for
[1:26:15] him
[1:26:16] because his his sphere is a reality in
[1:26:19] my life
[1:26:21] I can't live without him I can't make
[1:26:22] any more decisions without him I need
[1:26:24] him in everywhere every area every day
[1:26:26] of my life I need him
[1:26:29] that's what you do god call me elsewhere
[1:26:31] man would start preaching or a man with
[1:26:33] sour preaching somebody would start
[1:26:35] preaching
[1:26:36] you wouldn't sit there and say well
[1:26:37] let's all just close shop and let's just
[1:26:41] all go to the Methodist Church now why
[1:26:43] don't we do that
[1:26:44] you wouldn't do that
[1:26:47] somebody would stand up praise God
[1:26:51] let me say like this that's kind what
[1:26:53] happened when Tim Myers left God caught
[1:26:54] him well somebody's got to stand up and
[1:26:55] preach I'll preach
[1:26:57] nobody else into it I'll do it I feel
[1:27:00] that Lord to do it I feel like the
[1:27:01] Lord's given me a good understanding of
[1:27:02] his word and if I say true he'll keep me
[1:27:05] true praise God
[1:27:07] that's exactly what you do if God called
[1:27:10] me off the scene or called me somewhere
[1:27:12] else
[1:27:14] he said though you knew Jesus was coming
[1:27:17] you thought he was coming tomorrow yet
[1:27:21] you'd want to do something today to help
[1:27:24] those people
[1:27:25] fellow citizens of the kingdom of God
[1:27:28] you want to fellowship with them he said
[1:27:31] so that's the way I
[1:27:34] want to do something today to help God's
[1:27:37] people what's the best thing I can do
[1:27:40] tell me about Jesus
[1:27:41] tell him remind them of God's promise it
[1:27:45] will never fail you Church he'll never
[1:27:47] leave you he'll never forsake you jesus
[1:27:50] loves you he died for you his spirits
[1:27:52] here to help you that's the best thing I
[1:27:54] can do is tell you that Jesus Christ is
[1:27:56] here he loves you praise God hey man
[1:28:00] if I knew he's coming tomorrow I'd do
[1:28:03] that same thing today
[1:28:09] remember the RAM goes into how God led
[1:28:11] him to build the tabernacle
[1:28:14] and then he said we went through pastor
[1:28:17] after pastor he said and then God
[1:28:19] finally raised up Ormond Neville
[1:28:22] did you know brother Ram said I love
[1:28:24] hearing my pastor preach you know he
[1:28:25] said that
[1:28:26] he didn't say I love when my pastor sits
[1:28:29] down and plays the tape he said I love
[1:28:30] when my pastor preaches
[1:28:32] Hey
[1:28:33] praise God amen
[1:28:39] now program he goes into this thought
[1:28:42] against the brothers some of them were
[1:28:44] saying well nobody's hearing we're not
[1:28:46] growing nobody's hearing our preaching
[1:28:48] look what he says he said now you say
[1:28:50] well brother Ram if they will hear these
[1:28:52] signs and wonders of the Great God of
[1:28:54] heaven how are we going to do it so
[1:28:56] brother bam addresses the discouragement
[1:28:58] of the preachers you ever been
[1:28:59] discouraged because people don't believe
[1:29:00] the message you ever felt like how come
[1:29:03] people just don't believe him why can't
[1:29:05] they see that these are supernatural
[1:29:06] things why can't they see that when I
[1:29:08] see why can't they see the pillar fire
[1:29:10] program addresses these ministers were
[1:29:13] discouraged we've shown these signs
[1:29:16] wonders and miracles and they're not
[1:29:17] even moved
[1:29:19] program said well now what if st. Paul
[1:29:21] had that same idea
[1:29:24] what if Saint Paul were to quit you want
[1:29:26] to quit you don't see much people coming
[1:29:28] the message you want to quit so that
[1:29:30] what if Saint Paul would have quit
[1:29:33] but then said si no but he didn't those
[1:29:36] bishops say just as loyal to the message
[1:29:40] and
[1:29:42] Paul ever so often you reading the Bible
[1:29:45] he'd come back and visit the churches
[1:29:48] and we're having brother Brooks come
[1:29:49] later this month
[1:29:51] the man that helped establish this
[1:29:53] church by the authority of the Holy
[1:29:56] Ghost he's coming back to see how we're
[1:29:58] doing with amen
[1:30:00] I'm gonna show them you're real good
[1:30:02] praise God I'm feasting on God's Word
[1:30:04] I'm preaching his word instant in season
[1:30:07] and out of season I'm feeding God's
[1:30:09] little lambs praise God
[1:30:18] he said
[1:30:20] back and talk with the pastors the
[1:30:21] bishops took relief from the people
[1:30:23] member the Philippians gave him his food
[1:30:26] and clothing nobody else would give him
[1:30:28] food and clothing at the end except the
[1:30:30] Philippians
[1:30:31] all the other churches they didn't care
[1:30:34] yep Paul it started their churches can
[1:30:36] you imagine that
[1:30:37] it'd be like your brother Brooks said oh
[1:30:39] I had a need and I'll be like I don't
[1:30:40] care I don't care what brother Brooks
[1:30:42] needs I'm a pastor I
[1:30:46] can't I can't set him a love offering I
[1:30:48] can't send him some clothes or something
[1:30:49] like that
[1:30:51] he said only the Philippians helped and
[1:30:54] I was in chapter 4
[1:30:56] he says
[1:30:59] okay now let's read it Acts 1536 let's
[1:31:02] go back there
[1:31:04] do you feel more apostolic all the time
[1:31:07] long we go over that Magnum Ric where
[1:31:10] Apostolic Church
[1:31:11] we started the right way and we're gonna
[1:31:13] finish the right way I hope we finish at
[1:31:16] the rapture though honestly I don't have
[1:31:17] to diagnose the grave but if I do fine
[1:31:19] that's fine I hope we get to finish
[1:31:21] where we don't have to taste death
[1:31:23] praise God I hope by God's grace that's
[1:31:26] our calling in life here acts 15 36
[1:31:32] he said just remain as loyal as ever
[1:31:36] even if people turn you down even if
[1:31:39] they won't accept the signs miracles and
[1:31:40] wonders he said just remain ever as
[1:31:43] loyal as possible I
[1:31:47] know I've got a revelation in that
[1:31:49] church I have a revelation of that I
[1:31:51] know I'm not coming here for money or
[1:31:54] for popularity or anything like that I'm
[1:31:57] coming here because I know Jesus is
[1:31:58] watching
[1:31:59] and I want to be loyal to Jesus Christ
[1:32:02] that when I see him face to face he'll
[1:32:04] say well done
[1:32:06] you kept my word
[1:32:08] you were faithful you were faithful with
[1:32:11] little I'll make you ruler over much not
[1:32:14] that I want much I just want to be
[1:32:15] faithful
[1:32:16] X 1536 and some days after Paul said to
[1:32:20] Barnabas
[1:32:22] let's go visit again and visit our
[1:32:25] brother in every city let's see how
[1:32:26] those Saints are doing huh
[1:32:28] where we have preached the word of Lord
[1:32:31] and see how they doing how are they I
[1:32:35] love that's a real father's heart right
[1:32:37] there right let's see how our children
[1:32:39] are doing
[1:32:40] verse 37 and Barnabas determined to take
[1:32:43] them with them John whose surname was
[1:32:46] mark now look at this here come up here
[1:32:48] and
[1:32:49] barn verse 30 38 but Paul thought not
[1:32:52] good to take him with them who departed
[1:32:55] that from them from Pamphylia and went
[1:32:57] not with them to the work look at this
[1:33:00] church look at verse
[1:33:03] 39 and the contention was show so sharp
[1:33:06] between them that they departed asunder
[1:33:09] one from the other and so Barnabas took
[1:33:11] mark and sailed under Cyprus can you
[1:33:14] imagine these were the two men it'd be
[1:33:17] like it'd be like two brothers
[1:33:18] shoulder-to-shoulder we went on the
[1:33:21] first missionary trip and the whole
[1:33:22] Bible and then a few years later they
[1:33:26] get so mad at each other that's so sharp
[1:33:29] they'll say fine I won't go on the next
[1:33:31] missionary trip with you you'll go by
[1:33:33] yourself he said fine go ahead and go
[1:33:35] and yet they both had the Holy Ghost
[1:33:38] Milka
[1:33:40] see you can have the baptism of the Holy
[1:33:44] Ghost and God will even use your
[1:33:47] humanity to accomplish his will no doubt
[1:33:51] Church there was something Barnabas
[1:33:53] needed to preach
[1:33:55] somebody needed Barnabas's message over
[1:33:58] there and somebody else needed Paul so
[1:34:01] God said fine I'll use your disagreement
[1:34:02] I'll feed both of them praise God
[1:34:05] that's why church when you see this I
[1:34:09] can understand why was brother man he's
[1:34:10] so thought 1977 he so thought it
[1:34:15] sometimes brother hey man men are so
[1:34:18] sure they're right
[1:34:20] that they're willing to separate from
[1:34:22] other Holy Ghost filled men because I
[1:34:25] think I'm right and
[1:34:27] God will even allow that and said I'll
[1:34:29] even use that contention for my glory
[1:34:34] praise God many sometimes church when
[1:34:37] there's splits between preachers that
[1:34:39] don't mean there are the will of God it
[1:34:42] may be God is doing something
[1:34:44] differently God's gonna meet other needs
[1:34:46] that he couldn't meet any way
[1:34:49] so anytime you see a division against
[1:34:52] preachers
[1:34:53] don't judge it you know unless you can
[1:34:55] tell someone's off the word
[1:34:57] but you can also see how men can get so
[1:35:00] sure they can be so convinced I'm right
[1:35:03] and yet God will use that for his glory
[1:35:09] look at verse 40 and Paul chose Silas
[1:35:12] and the parted being recommended by the
[1:35:15] brother unto the grace of God and he
[1:35:17] went through Syria and Cecilia
[1:35:19] confirming the churches
[1:35:22] confirming just means a strengthen to
[1:35:25] edify so Paul just went back and said
[1:35:27] hey brothers how you doing now look here
[1:35:29] we got the world Lord here look at these
[1:35:30] other letters I got look at these
[1:35:32] revelations he just went to encourage
[1:35:34] them let me encourage you he said but
[1:35:35] you must enter the kingdom of God
[1:35:37] through much persecution and
[1:35:42] just that visit just that visit I
[1:35:45] imagine brother amen was enough to
[1:35:47] encourage those brothers and said my
[1:35:49] Paul can do it I can do it
[1:35:51] hallelujah Paul can withstand all the
[1:35:54] powers of darkness I know I can
[1:35:56] withstand it too I
[1:35:59] don't have it by the other text but
[1:36:02] that brother from Texas here
[1:36:06] he said just by talking to me this week
[1:36:10] he said he was totally strengthened let
[1:36:12] me see if I can find it real quick I
[1:36:16] was telling that but to brother amen
[1:36:25] good morning I just want express my
[1:36:26] gratitude to you for the encouragement
[1:36:27] and insistence on speaking to me cuz he
[1:36:30] at first he said aw you don't have to
[1:36:32] call me but I just felt let Lauren last
[1:36:34] Sunday night I was washing dishes many
[1:36:35] men I was washing dishes there and I
[1:36:38] just felt let he said oh you have to
[1:36:39] call me I just felt led I've got to call
[1:36:40] this brother I just got to talk to him I
[1:36:42] felt led
[1:36:44] now usually I'd be like oh great I don't
[1:36:46] talk to him I can go to bed it's like
[1:36:48] you have to worry about something else
[1:36:51] he said it lifted me up from a low low
[1:36:55] place and allowed me to take the next
[1:36:57] step forward as a result the
[1:36:59] condemnation has begun to leave me
[1:37:02] bringing me a peace I've been longing

[1:38:02] me go and courage that brother let me go
[1:38:03] encourage that one and
[1:38:05] but was Paul Superman no Paul got solo

[1:38:48] all day I got a preach tonight TV
[1:38:50] okay
[1:38:55] let me find one thing to close here
[1:38:59] let me close to this
[1:39:04] program says we've got to think of the
[1:39:08] others coming behind us these young
[1:39:11] people a place for our children our
[1:39:13] daughters we don't want them out in the
[1:39:15] world and things like that we want them
[1:39:16] girls raised like their mothers we've
[1:39:18] got our arrangements for that if there's
[1:39:20] no tomorrow we don't know that if
[1:39:21] there's no tomorrow we haven't done
[1:39:23] nothing but been at the Masters business
[1:39:25] and been found at our post of duty when
[1:39:28] he does come that's what I like bangs
[1:39:30] idea to build a church because it'll
[1:39:33] give the generations if there's another
[1:39:35] generation it will give them someplace
[1:39:38] to go you gotta have someplace to go
[1:39:41] right you sell those big message
[1:39:43] churches whether they have they have
[1:39:44] Friday night youth night Saturday night
[1:39:46] youth why are they doing that to keep
[1:39:47] the youth out of the world you gotta
[1:39:49] have somewhere to go you gotta have
[1:39:51] someplace the fellowship right as Jane
[1:39:55] gets older and Lily and Eden come on
[1:39:57] over to my house you know let's have a
[1:40:00] Friday night youth at my house we'll
[1:40:03] have to do something they got to have
[1:40:05] someplace to go praise God we got to
[1:40:08] think about them if the Lord tarries
[1:40:10] now if God wants a bill to church he'll
[1:40:13] send us the money to do it I don't need
[1:40:14] our help bill in the church when did God
[1:40:17] ever need a man's help to build a house
[1:40:18] I don't need anybody's help praise God
[1:40:21] but it'll send us the ability to do it
[1:40:24] if there's another if that's his will
[1:40:26] for this this area
[1:40:28] for example brother Randy sighs they're
[1:40:31] still renting out that cheap that church
[1:40:32] he's been a pastor there almost his
[1:40:34] whole life up in there in Lorraine
[1:40:37] they're still renting it and they still
[1:40:40] have a very good ministry thriving
[1:40:42] ministry godly people
[1:40:43] supernatural he was telling me last time
[1:40:45] I seen at the funeral he was tell me
[1:40:47] he's preached on divine healing and he
[1:40:48] said the church swept or the Holy Spirit
[1:40:50] swept right to the Church and a couple
[1:40:51] people got healed right there in the
[1:40:52] service yet there right the church they
[1:40:56] never felt led to build so that's fine
[1:40:59] let him go with the leading of the Lord
[1:41:00] praise God right
[1:41:01] that's just one one idea but then Tim
[1:41:04] Pruitt he said the Holy Spirit told him
[1:41:07] to build a church which he got a lot of
[1:41:08] criticism for it but then he built it
[1:41:10] and he said now they they build it with
[1:41:12] absolutely no debt I'm talking like a
[1:41:13] millions of minutes people just donated
[1:41:16] their time building they had all these
[1:41:17] construction workers they just donated
[1:41:19] it and they have no debt at all he said
[1:41:21] God build this church it was right for
[1:41:24] that that that woman had cancer and he
[1:41:26] said God told me to build the church and
[1:41:27] he said greater miracles gonna be done
[1:41:29] there they built the church the woman
[1:41:32] had cancer that's where they scanned it
[1:41:34] there was cancer she went she got the
[1:41:36] Holy Ohr she had the anointing of the
[1:41:37] Holy Ghost in her service said she was
[1:41:39] healed she went back and there was no
[1:41:41] cancer and they put it on Facebook
[1:41:43] if God wants to build a church you ain't
[1:41:46] gonna stop him
[1:41:47] praise God but if God wants to keep us
[1:41:50] here renting God will keep us here
[1:41:52] renting the thing to do is say God let
[1:41:55] your will be done and let me let me find
[1:41:57] your leading or the Lord that's my
[1:41:59] prayer to let me find God's leading
[1:42:02] you said you got to think of others now
[1:42:04] I'm gonna close to this so I suggest
[1:42:07] this let's into our feet so I suggest
[1:42:09] this to brother Neville let's carry this
[1:42:11] on just as we have
[1:42:15] let's let it just the way it is
[1:42:18] huh if ever brother Rand had a chance to
[1:42:23] tell these preachers to stop preaching
[1:42:25] and play my tapes this was it he had all
[1:42:27] of me I brother Crais here brother jr.
[1:42:28] Jackson he had brother Snelling he had
[1:42:31] brother Neville he had all these
[1:42:32] brothers here if he ever wanted to tell
[1:42:34] them you need to sit down and press play
[1:42:36] he would have done it but he didn't he
[1:42:40] said let's keep it just the way it is
[1:42:42] and musicians you can come by they meant
[1:42:44] if you got a song let me know buddy
[1:42:46] now boy bear says I'm grateful for these
[1:42:49] young ministers oh that makes me feel so
[1:42:52] good brother man that's it I just I say
[1:42:55] thank you Lord
[1:42:56] see actually at the day of judgment for
[1:43:00] this entire valleys through here there
[1:43:02] will be no excuse because we've got
[1:43:03] little churches setting out everywhere
[1:43:05] outpost listening-posts waiting for the
[1:43:10] coming of the Lord
[1:43:14] so brother man never never limited the
[1:43:18] fivefold ministry in fact at the end of
[1:43:21] this sermon let me go down to page 20
[1:43:23] whatever it is he said I pray you bless
[1:43:26] these preachers each one of them in thy
[1:43:29] name you will keep them in the faith
[1:43:31] that was once delivered to the Saints
[1:43:32] that never will they vary from that and
[1:43:35] out of this group may you send pastors
[1:43:38] teachers evangelists Oh God granite and
[1:43:41] that they may hold the fort everywhere
[1:43:44] wherever they are may they continually
[1:43:47] work until Jesus comes
[1:43:51] okay we all say amen amen
[1:43:54] that's brother man's prayer he said
[1:43:56] don't change a thing and just so you're
[1:43:59] sure Church just so you're sure
[1:44:02] where is this one six months later he
[1:44:05] says the same thing
[1:44:08] I'm sorry nine months later in the seals
[1:44:10] they ask brother Graham should've and
[1:44:12] just continued on the field of course
[1:44:14] don't change a thing
[1:44:18] six months after that in
[1:44:20] 64
[1:44:23] August brother Adam of are you the only
[1:44:26] person that should preach no every man
[1:44:28] that feels that god of call a call of
[1:44:30] God on his life get into the ministry
[1:44:32] and start preaching we need them
[1:44:37] it'd be a lot easier just to
[1:44:40] play
[1:44:44] sit down
[1:44:46] amen brother Branham
[1:44:49] amen
[1:44:51] hey
[1:44:53] be allowed to either do that a
[1:44:56] lot easier
[1:44:58] but Bertram's said you don't change a
[1:45:00] thing
[1:45:01] whatever Paul established keep it going
[1:45:04] what Paul established because Paul
[1:45:06] established thus saith the Lord and he
[1:45:08] said to change one thing you're accursed
[1:45:10] I
[1:45:11] don't care what they get richer I don't
[1:45:12] care these people get richer whatever
[1:45:13] watch their spiritual lives watch what
[1:45:16] comes out of their mouth
[1:45:18] it'll show if they're blessed or cursed
[1:45:23] let's bow our heads here for a word of
[1:45:25] Prayer
[1:45:29] Church this is really helping me but I'm
[1:45:31] hoping it's helping you to to see that
[1:45:33] we are doing the right thing
[1:45:36] our church is doing nothing wrong
[1:45:40] this is God's will for our lives to
[1:45:44] gather with whoever a two or three are
[1:45:47] gathered
[1:45:48] to preach it to be just as loyal to it
[1:45:52] to be faithful to the fivefold ministry
[1:45:55] because it's part of the word and not to
[1:45:58] change one thing I
[1:46:01] didn't get to all I want to say there's
[1:46:03] a maybe Lord willing tonight I've been
[1:46:04] doing that godliness but maybe we're
[1:46:06] willing I look at this tonight we'll see
[1:46:07] a
[1:46:10] church if God is going to restore all
[1:46:13] the power of Pentecost let's have him
[1:46:15] restore our hearts first praise God to
[1:46:18] the doctrine to the ways of the Lord and
[1:46:21] let's do our part
[1:46:24] let's leave footprints on the sands of
[1:46:27] time for these children coming up
[1:46:29] and that means we should pray more that
[1:46:32] means we should witness more we should
[1:46:34] do everything anything we can do to
[1:46:36] leave a footprint in the sand let's do
[1:46:38] it so they know how to serve God let's
[1:46:42] be faithful
[1:46:43] with the talents God has given us let's
[1:46:47] pray your heavenly Father I lift my
[1:46:49] hands to You Lord in reference
[1:46:52] I
[1:46:53] lift my eyes to the Lord from whence
[1:46:56] cometh my help my help cometh from the
[1:46:58] Lord

[1:47:03] have given this divine blueprint

[1:47:20] prophet Lord he fulfilled many
[1:47:22] scriptures he was faithful to his
[1:47:24] commission we believe he'll hear well
[1:47:27] done on that day I believe there will be
[1:47:30] a huge portion of heaven that awaits him
[1:47:32] Lord I believe

[1:47:39] footprints are still there we can see
