TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen our god is so big amen that he's trying to make our thinking big amen getting quiet why are we getting quiet one man of you shall chase a thousand for the Lord your God he it is that fight for [Music] you hallelujah amen now watch this spiritual Israel it says something very powerful here as he hath promised [Music] you now think about that you got two million people going up to the promised land two million people and when they get in there we see that God had already made promises to themen because he knew he was positionally placing them amen I want you to see this this wasn't uh a New Jerusalem where everybody was gathered in a city or something like this when God gave them their possession they were all in specific spots amen I want you to see this so you know they weren't in church all the time cuz you know it's it's a lot easier to fight the battle when when you when you got some you got some real big Christians right next to you amen help me pray through Brothers glory amen but look at how God is manifesting himself he's putting them in a land with borders amen he's putting them in a land where there's enemies amen remember when it came to the Book of Joshua people said that's the Millennium and brother B said it could not have been the Millennium because there was battles there amen right he said it was the land of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah if you in that land is the same ability as [Applause] that Hallelujah one man of you shall chase a thousand for the Lord your God he is figh fight for you as he promise amen so all he's got to do is have one man one woman Amen in that land in that land amen see what I'm saying we got to know what the Holy Ghost is amen the Holy Ghost places you in that land amen apply that to your heart amen apply that cuz I tell you what it's not a land that you see it's a land that you're spiritually in Hallelujah you're in that land that it doesn't matter what comes your way am yes sir you could chase a thousand Devils out of your midst but it's what you see if you see just little on me or little insignificant me then what you won't be able to do it but if you can say I'm in a land that's flowing with milk and honey and my God made a promise it is written one man of you shall chase a thousand Hallelujah you know what that means that means that you know who you are amen you realize God can't fail that amen he can't amen if you know you're in that land amen amen yes sir next verse 2311 watch this take good heed therefore unto yourselves that ye love the Lord your God everybody's like ah I don't have to chase a thousand anymore because I fail all the time can I ask you a question what made your love acceptable to God what made your Merit acceptable to God now we're getting quiet amen and I'm going this way for a reason because many times we allow our love to wne amen by what we see on this amen it beats us up for weeks sometimes sometimes months sometimes I know people have been in there for years years yes I know people that can't even get out of it and they're just like Johnny Crow remember the farmer tied him up to the post he just kept walking around amen then they said one day the farmer he came over and he took that off and he said Johnny Crow was so used to doing he just kept on doing it he was free amen he was [Music] free but he didn't have a revelation amen that's it of what happened amen yes Hallelujah let me ask you this when was your love acceptable to God understand what I'm saying what's the measure how high do I got to get oh well I got to be like preacher so and so and and I gota be like that and I got to be like that now you're getting it cuz wait a minute whose love made you acceptable to begin with amen the Bible says in first John that it was Jesus that first love you you didn't first love him he first loved you and then he anointed that predestinated seed amen hallelujah and then watch his goal was to get your love for him to get repent and get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and he would what he would draw you amen with his love Hallelujah and you'd be just like the Apostle Paul amen I'm the least of the Saints amen I'm the least of them amen God makes it in a way so that you could never feel acceptable amen by how much you and your own ability could love him [Music] amen Your Love isn't a sacrifice amen Your Love isn't a Bloodshed amen yes sir your love isn't what amen in knowing that he took your place I'm not doing away with repentance I'm doing away with the fact you feel unaccepted you are not accepted remember in the adoption message brother brandom said he said Jesus can look at you no different than the way he looked at you when he put your name on that book Hallelujah Hal Hallelujah he knew you'd sin he knew you'd fall short but he couldn't want see anything but what you were on the [Applause] bookall so you're we're looking at this he wants us to look at [Music] that what is that name how can I see it it's the word brother sister remember in question answers I don't know why I'm going this way they asked him a question about that book and their names and he said he said the book doesn't say uh Le Veil will be saved in so and so and so and such and age he said it's the revelation of what it is while it's unfolding amen come on now amen I identification is it your name or the word the word how did God make it I mean do we all need to get a vision oh there's my name I see it when this word opens up to you amen remember you've heard from your theophany amen Holy Ghost is preaching tonight this stuff's just coming now amen hallelujah you heard
