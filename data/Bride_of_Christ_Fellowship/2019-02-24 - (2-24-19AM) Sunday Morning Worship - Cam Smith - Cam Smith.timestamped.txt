[34:05] just like to read everybody again the
[34:09] name of Lord Jesus Christ good to see
[34:10] the Saints this morning and you know we
[34:12] all know brother cam it'll be preaching
[34:13] for us today we're very thankful it's
[34:15] been a while since we had him but we're
[34:16] very glad to come back we've been
[34:18] shifting the dates I probably shifting
[34:20] the dates to try to get the right timing
[34:22] and I really feel like this is the right
[34:24] timing how many feel the presence of the
[34:26] Lord this morning amen
[34:28] there's just some wonderful worship
[34:30] there we really feel the presence of the
[34:31] Lord you know and I just want to just
[34:33] thank brother cam for his faithful
[34:35] service to the Lord he's just been a
[34:36] real servant to God I really thank God
[34:38] for the cam you know he was the first of
[34:40] all six of us to become a Christian
[34:43] he's the one that said I don't care what
[34:45] anybody else says I'm gonna serve God
[34:47] cam was very pivotal in my life is
[34:50] because of him listening to his
[34:51] Christian music I started making me
[34:53] hunger to be a Christian him he let me
[34:56] borrow his car and it was because of him
[34:59] that I started liking Christian music oh
[35:01] my this is glorious ffh one of these
[35:04] days and cam has just been a tremendous
[35:08] brother you know he I never told this
[35:11] story but in my senior year before I was
[35:14] doing the state championship at the long
[35:15] jump I pulled a muscle and I think cam
[35:19] was a Christian at this point and I was
[35:21] I did awful I barely made it to the
[35:23] final round
[35:23] I was the I was the state champion the
[35:25] year before now I was feeling all sorry
[35:27] for myself I'm all down I barely made
[35:29] the finals cam comes along and he speaks
[35:30] these words to me he's like he's like
[35:33] forget about it you're not injured take
[35:35] off that sleeve he said go out there and
[35:37] win the championship there like it just
[35:40] lit up a fire in me you know I'm like
[35:41] okay I'm gonna do this and I ignored the
[35:44] pain I went and won the championship
[35:45] because cam talked me into it he told me
[35:49] to get my eyes off those don't worry
[35:50] about that he said just go do
[35:52] and then years later in 2010 cam
[35:55] preached a message for us called Lord
[35:58] just once more and after that I was so
[36:02] moved by the Holy Spirit we just saw a
[36:03] string of miracles after that because it
[36:06] just it was such a mighty message of the
[36:08] Holy Spirit that it causes the crowd to
[36:11] more for more of God and God moved in
[36:13] such a tremendous way so I thank the
[36:15] Lord for using our brother God's just
[36:18] helping me a real faithful witness in
[36:20] the point so we very very thank God for
[36:21] that I just want to share that story I
[36:23] never got a chance to share those
[36:24] stories but my brother has been such a
[36:26] wonderful sermon we're so thankful for
[36:28] the Lord Jesus Christ let's say into our

[48:30] transgression to make an end of sins and
[48:32] to make reconciliation for iniquity and

[52:08] among your people today Oh God raise
[52:11] them up row God for their glory in Jesus
[52:13] Christ and we pray the church says
[52:15] together a men you may be seated
[52:17] may be seated get a little bit of a late
[52:28] start here but by God's grace
[52:30] just hold on with me if you can I'm a
[52:32] preacher a sermon I heard I'll be honest
[52:36] with you I I said Lord why do you want
[52:38] me to preach and I read this quote and
[52:40] then I had a brother just text me out of
[52:43] the blue and he sent me a quote to
[52:44] parallel exactly what I was just reading
[52:46] I said well that's kind of what happens
[52:51] who hath despised the day of small
[52:53] things like I said he's here right now
[52:57] hallelujah now I want to bring forth a
[53:00] little message I believe would be a
[53:02] blessing to you this morning we'll see
[53:03] what the Lord or do but the idea let's
[53:06] just entitle if we can the hidden
[53:08] purpose of the Messiah sign and the
[53:10] hidden purpose of the Messiah kind and
[53:14] then we'll get to our subject matter and
[53:16] our subject matter this morning is
[53:17] Akron's Messiah s and by God's grace
[53:21] we'll see what he'll do with this
[53:23] momentarily notice here working with so
[53:27] to say
[53:27] hidden purpose of the Messiah sign
[53:30] remember we just read that in Daniel 9
[53:33] there is talking about the 70 weeks of
[53:36] Daniel and I want you to notice there
[53:38] that it actually we kind of highlighted
[53:41] just two portions of the 25th and 26th
[53:43] verse which actually talked about the
[53:46] Messiah right a min and who was that
[53:49] Messiah Jesus Christ was at Messiah a
[53:52] man of that word right there Messiah was
[53:55] capitalized wasn't it amen
[53:57] it was actually looking for more than
[53:59] just a man but it was looking for what
[54:02] God in flesh amen emanuelle to be
[54:05] amongst us right I want you to see this
[54:08] that word Messiah is actually mashiac
[54:11] amen and in the Hebrew and that word
[54:14] actually has a few different meanings
[54:16] that you can bring in but the word
[54:18] actually means Messiah
[54:20] it actually means anointed amen it means
[54:23] The Anointed One right and I hear
[54:26] brother branham ah let me let me just go
[54:28] this way here this Messiah that we're
[54:31] looking at in Daniel 9 he was the
[54:34] anointed one right and what God
[54:36] proclaimed in his word that the anointed
[54:39] Lawn would come in dwell amongst his
[54:42] people in it he did this brother sister
[54:47] watch in the manifestation of Jesus
[54:49] Christ in flesh amen
[54:51] oh God replace that inside of that woman
[54:55] right and bring forth here Jesus Christ
[54:58] in flesh right it came in a way that was
[55:01] so humble that they did not see it
[55:04] brother sister this is what I want to
[55:06] focus on today in the idea if you can
[55:08] catch it
[55:09] that there Jesus Christ was sitting
[55:11] there for 30 years the anointing Lord
[55:15] and the whole of Jerusalem the Anointed
[55:21] Messiah right in their myths and they
[55:25] didn't even know it and so much of the
[55:29] fact when he came they received his not
[55:31] they received him not
[55:32] they didn't give him the time of day
[55:35] well their lives 30 years
[55:39] not even anointed so to say or to look
[55:41] at right but it was a secret work that
[55:44] God was what bringing forth in Jesus
[55:46] Christ he's had to live a perfect life
[55:48] and what he had to do it because you
[55:51] couldn't name it he had to good because
[55:55] he had to take your place amen he was
[55:57] nothing but God in flesh and he could do
[56:00] nothing but live or die him but he was
[56:04] he came and lived out that male
[56:06] attribute of the Lord knowing that his
[56:10] female attribute would need to a lot to
[56:14] take of that sacrifice of the male
[56:16] attribute oh my so that ought to make
[56:19] you feel pretty good this morning
[56:20] because that would tell us that maybe
[56:23] there's something special about you
[56:26] hallelujah so we begin that word Messiah
[56:30] or Mashiach is actually used
[56:33] thirty-eight times in the Old Testament
[56:36] right and now by the grace of God in
[56:39] Daniel 9 now that's the only reference
[56:42] that we have to the Messiah so what are
[56:45] you saying I'm saying that 36 times that
[56:47] word is used in the Hebrew it's not
[56:49] necessarily referencing Jesus Christ at
[56:52] all so what are you saying that if that
[56:55] word means anointed it's actually
[56:57] talking about somebody else all right
[57:01] now I want you to take this picture with
[57:03] me if we can because remember in this
[57:06] hour and in this day and I'm going to
[57:08] begin the bridges if we can but there is
[57:10] what we've seen another rendition or
[57:13] another coming forth of the Messiah sign
[57:16] it meant as Jesus Christ was on earth
[57:19] what we see the the the the discernment
[57:21] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[57:23] we see Lord Jesus Christ by the word
[57:26] showing that he was there that was the
[57:30] Messiah exon and what they asked her
[57:32] probably show how is that the Messiah
[57:34] Cod and he said it's Luke 1730 amen in
[57:38] that last day thus the Son of man should
[57:41] be revealed amen
[57:42] that was a capital S amen and we come
[57:45] back around and we see that it was a son
[57:48] of man revealing the
[57:50] son of man amen hallelujah but brother
[57:54] sister and what I'd really like to jump
[57:57] into today
[57:58] is that you'll actually find out that
[58:01] God anointed that prophet in in and what
[58:04] he came forth in such a way revealing
[58:08] the Messiah side that the people lot
[58:11] they began to worship him like the
[58:13] Messiah isn't that something and yet we
[58:20] find out that there's actually he
[58:25] himself identified that that was the
[58:27] masonic sign and remember in 64 question
[58:30] answers he came forth and they said they
[58:33] said it looks so much like you could be
[58:35] that messiah in this hour and he said
[58:38] I'm not that Messiah he said that would
[58:41] make me Antichrist but he looked so much
[58:46] like Jesus Christ that the world began
[58:51] to mistake him for being Jesus Christ
[58:55] here on this earth oh ma now in this
[59:00] idea that we want to begin to bring
[59:03] forth I want you to see and I'm just
[59:06] going to quote it to you for now but I
[59:08] want you to see that when they asked the
[59:10] Prophet if he was the Messiah he said no
[59:13] I'm not he said but we are messiahs he
[59:20] actually referred to the people never
[59:24] separating himself and never coming
[59:26] around and say yes you're right it is me
[59:29] I am the Messiah but every time he would
[59:32] reference that Jesus Christ presence was
[59:35] near he would say we have that show me
[59:42] an isolated spot I can't find it so we
[59:46] come to a place that we realized that
[59:49] God brought a messiah sign in Jesus
[59:53] Christ right
[59:54] he was the Word made manifest but then
[59:57] when we realized that the Elias sign
[1:00:00] would have what come before
[1:00:03] the great and dreadful day of the Lord
[1:00:04] John the Baptist would come forth it
[1:00:07] away he would want actually just flood
[1:00:09] he would be making away prepared for
[1:00:12] Jesus Christ to take over hallelujah and
[1:00:16] Lord they mistaken well that
[1:00:20] manifestation of the Lord and miss that
[1:00:23] God was actually trying to do something
[1:00:26] greater than what John the Baptist was
[1:00:30] and now we come into a place with this
[1:00:34] prophet that God has given us we've
[1:00:37] taken off a little bit of a nature and a
[1:00:41] lot of people have that we begin to
[1:00:44] place people on pedestals preacher on
[1:00:49] pedestal and I've seen it so much just
[1:00:52] being a pastor evangelist and so forth
[1:00:54] are coming they'll say oh brother
[1:00:55] Branham was so great
[1:00:57] oh so mighty Oh everything I don't know
[1:01:01] about you but if you got the Holy Ghost
[1:01:03] Sonia you get that little conviction
[1:01:06] that rolls on you because they're
[1:01:09] actually elevating and glorifying a man
[1:01:12] and not actually seeing that he was a
[1:01:15] sinner that God was trying to use so we
[1:01:23] come down to the idea oh brother you're
[1:01:27] talking about the hidden purpose of the
[1:01:30] Messiah son and that's what I want to
[1:01:33] talk about because you see the Messiah
[1:01:36] sign in itself was obvious Allah knew
[1:01:41] her they would come to Jesus Christ
[1:01:44] Nicodemus and so forth and they would
[1:01:46] come form they say they say we know that
[1:01:48] God is with you because no man can do
[1:01:50] the things that you do except God be
[1:01:52] with him they needed the brother branham
[1:01:55] watch you will come in the Gulf to
[1:01:57] Chicago and preach baptism and oneness
[1:02:00] and so forth never say but nobody would
[1:02:06] challenge that gift they would stay
[1:02:08] separate of it and they would show that
[1:02:12] what it was obvious what God had in
[1:02:15] front of
[1:02:15] them why are you sitting here today
[1:02:18] because it's obvious what God has done
[1:02:21] for you so we have the option and I feel
[1:02:27] that we've been over over lightened in
[1:02:30] this area of just coming back and
[1:02:33] talking about what God did through a man
[1:02:35] or a reading quotes and and doing this
[1:02:38] and doing that and we're actually
[1:02:40] missing the whole purpose of why God
[1:02:43] sent the Messiah sign the hidden point
[1:02:47] of what God was trying to do for his
[1:02:49] children amen you see was Jesus Christ
[1:02:53] when he came forth did he come to a
[1:02:56] place and say okay uh it's really just
[1:02:59] my show here but you know the scripture
[1:03:04] says that Jesus didn't even have to
[1:03:06] baptize he misled his disciples done I'm
[1:03:14] going some of this you see that Masonic
[1:03:17] sign wants to be glorified that Masonic
[1:03:20] sign it was the Word made flesh amen and
[1:03:23] that's why they came to him they cried
[1:03:26] out Lord they cried out yes you're the
[1:03:29] son of God yes we worship you but I want
[1:03:33] us to see that as we begin to work with
[1:03:36] this idea here that God had a hidden
[1:03:39] purpose that he was trying to reveal to
[1:03:42] his children and I feel like we're
[1:03:45] standing here and that's went right over
[1:03:47] our head try to pay close attention if
[1:03:52] you can help me here I want you to see
[1:03:55] this in 61 117 Messiah listen this
[1:03:59] message when I get a chance to be a
[1:04:01] great blessing to you and eat 22 he says
[1:04:03] he says then when God was made flesh and
[1:04:08] became the Messiah he says then if we
[1:04:13] can yield ourselves to be the anointed
[1:04:17] like he was like who that Messiah is
[1:04:22] capital M
[1:04:25] he says you could yield yourself to a
[1:04:30] place that you could be anointed like he
[1:04:33] was oh that's just for preachers what's
[1:04:42] your expectation for what God wants for
[1:04:44] you so now we're coming today you see
[1:04:49] brother sister this is not a dead work
[1:04:50] at home it's not a dead work we actually
[1:04:54] have the only living word that's
[1:04:58] existing in this world right now this
[1:05:01] playa counterfeits there's plenty of
[1:05:04] things that look close but I'll tell you
[1:05:06] what brother sister this is the only
[1:05:09] message that can bring Jesus Christ on
[1:05:12] the scene a minute so look at this now
[1:05:17] he's talking about you and he says if
[1:05:20] you can get yielded like he was he said
[1:05:23] we become Messiah pets notice he adds an
[1:05:29] X to it so you don't become the Messiah
[1:05:33] you become a messiah at hallelujah so
[1:05:38] now you become what you become an
[1:05:41] anointed one as the bride of Jesus
[1:05:46] Christ now I want you to see this
[1:05:49] because the Prophet himself he didn't
[1:05:52] say no wait a minute this is my show but
[1:05:56] notice the Messiah sign that was working
[1:06:00] inside of him was actually after the
[1:06:03] same purpose that the Mossad sign in
[1:06:05] Jesus Christ was made you'll see this
[1:06:09] we're gonna go through it alright now
[1:06:10] notice here he says we become Messiah
[1:06:13] aunts little lights he said that's what
[1:06:16] the church is supposed to be
[1:06:21] we've been supposed to be that for 60
[1:06:23] years and we see it right now it's just
[1:06:24] as dead as it's ever been
[1:06:26] God took the eyes away from just like
[1:06:29] Samson once his eyes took around Samson
[1:06:32] discharged around the old the old grain
[1:06:34] silo wherever it was there the garner
[1:06:36] and well he just kept on look just push
[1:06:38] it
[1:06:39] blind couldn't even see who he was
[1:06:40] didn't see what was going on around him
[1:06:43] what he actually took the condition of
[1:06:45] the age in it he was blind election
[1:06:48] miserable and didn't even know it we
[1:06:51] don't have to be miserable today you
[1:06:53] don't have to Lord you don't have to sit
[1:06:56] there and wonder if God came he came in
[1:06:59] and he's looking for a boss or a man and
[1:07:03] that fast so here a man going to God so
[1:07:08] no yes that's what the church is
[1:07:10] supposed to be that doesn't mean that a
[1:07:11] preacher has to come in and be it for
[1:07:13] you that's what you are
[1:07:18] he says the church is supposed to be
[1:07:21] lights little anointed ones his standing
[1:07:25] light is the light of Messiah risen
[1:07:30] Christ in his people the anointed ones
[1:07:35] carrying forth his light into all the
[1:07:38] church ages he said sometimes catch this
[1:07:41] it go most goes completely out where we
[1:07:46] at it's almost completely out then it
[1:07:54] comes back again that's for you that was
[1:08:01] anointed for you
[1:08:03] so he says God's anointed one God's
[1:08:09] Messiah
[1:08:11] do you realize Akron has a
[1:08:14] representation of the Messiah sign the
[1:08:20] Messiah light is in this area the
[1:08:24] Messiah guide all forget seeing the
[1:08:26] spiritual eyes brother sister this
[1:08:28] homeland it might be light outside but
[1:08:30] it's completely dark but in this one
[1:08:33] little room that's pulsating what the
[1:08:37] light of God and you know it just takes
[1:08:41] a little light in a very dark place and
[1:08:44] it will displace darkness itself amen
[1:08:48] light is dominant light makes darkness
[1:08:52] hide amen and what the light of God is
[1:08:55] not a weak heart
[1:08:56] it's not a light but it is what
[1:08:59] the omnipotent God in displaying his
[1:09:02] children Amen hallelujah so he says if
[1:09:09] Messiah means The Anointed One and means
[1:09:11] King is says then if the church is
[1:09:13] anointed by the Messiah spirit it
[1:09:17] becomes a lesser but still a messiah
[1:09:22] because it has his light reflecting his
[1:09:25] power reflecting his glory
[1:09:27] reflecting his Dominion so it is Messiah
[1:09:30] oh how it reflects him in his kingdom in
[1:09:34] his domain he's saying what's God been
[1:09:40] trying to do maybe it's a question in
[1:09:42] your mind he's been trying to turn you
[1:09:45] into the Messiah Church hallelujah you
[1:09:52] see we'll get through this after a bit
[1:09:54] let's let's just keep moving on I want
[1:09:56] to read you a few times that Messiah
[1:09:57] their Messiah is used in the Old
[1:09:59] Testament Psalms 20 verse 5 I'm going to
[1:10:01] go pretty quick here just hold with me
[1:10:03] because I got a lot to say Psalms 20
[1:10:04] verse 5 it says we will rejoice in thy
[1:10:07] salvation and in the name of our God we
[1:10:10] will set up our banners the Lord fulfill
[1:10:12] all by petitions whoo that sounds good
[1:10:15] now no I that the Lord saveth his
[1:10:19] anointed he will hear him from his holy
[1:10:24] heaven with the saving strength of his
[1:10:26] right hand oh ma that's something that
[1:10:31] word Messiah or Messiah the Old
[1:10:33] Testament it was an anointed Church God
[1:10:36] will save you amen he calls you an
[1:10:39] orator
[1:10:40] because brother sister we should know
[1:10:42] that God is here right now
[1:10:45] they were going away but do you realize
[1:10:47] that you are called to bring an
[1:10:50] atmosphere amen
[1:10:51] you're called when you go not just in
[1:10:55] the church but wherever you go your
[1:10:57] parking the life of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:59] Himself amen
[1:11:01] and what does that mean that means God
[1:11:03] Himself is inside of you
[1:11:07] that's why Jesus takes it out of your
[1:11:09] belly shall flow rivers of living water
[1:11:12] how's the flow you see that flow that's
[1:11:17] not something to Sarah whoo I'm in the
[1:11:21] message whoa
[1:11:24] that's living waters oh can someone pray
[1:11:29] for me I'm in the message you know why
[1:11:35] our church is sit in the condition that
[1:11:38] they do is because we don't look like
[1:11:40] messiahs each one of you were made to
[1:11:46] pack the Holy Spirit each one of you
[1:11:49] were made to catch souls but you see
[1:11:52] many times we've talked we've tried
[1:11:55] we've done this and that and we're
[1:11:56] missing the point
[1:11:57] you've got to yield to God you've got to
[1:12:02] let God speak through your mouth
[1:12:05] hallelujah hey even preachers got
[1:12:08] difficult I get up here brother since
[1:12:10] I've done this so much i canna set
[1:12:11] myself aside as fence company income
[1:12:13] really fast or slow picking this lot and
[1:12:15] then little things come by I don't even
[1:12:17] control it it just rolls out but brother
[1:12:19] sister I step down from the anointing I
[1:12:22] just told the brother I said I said make
[1:12:24] sure you get to me about five ten
[1:12:25] minutes before I after I'm preaching
[1:12:27] because after that and I preach like
[1:12:30] this I'm whooped and if I'm not careful
[1:12:35] I can let that atmosphere start going
[1:12:38] and I'll sit just right there and almost
[1:12:40] like I'm under a juniper tree so I said
[1:12:43] what I'm said but the camphor you preset
[1:12:45] you gonna kill yourself so what if I'm
[1:12:48] not preaching like that but if he's
[1:12:50] preaching like that through me
[1:12:52] helliya but we have to get to a place we
[1:12:57] all have our ups and downs and we're
[1:12:59] trying to get rid of those because we
[1:13:00] don't need those you know faith don't
[1:13:04] have ups and downs faith has thus saith
[1:13:07] the Lord
[1:13:07] faith knows the will of God hallelujah
[1:13:12] prophet said he said he said that the
[1:13:14] only way to know the will of God is my
[1:13:17] faith well you see that's why we looked
[1:13:23] inside we said well what about my
[1:13:25] brother what about my sister order what
[1:13:27] about my family what about this what
[1:13:28] about my cousin and brother sister what
[1:13:30] does it say on the inside of you that's
[1:13:35] not a hope so faith is the substance of
[1:13:39] things hoped for the evidence of the
[1:13:41] unseen you realize hope sits there with
[1:13:47] an expectation of good if the very
[1:13:52] expectation of good is there and it says
[1:13:55] yes that's possible
[1:13:57] then you need to grab some faith on that
[1:13:59] and say yes it is the will of God and
[1:14:04] don't let your profession see different
[1:14:06] things we're not weak there are so
[1:14:15] vilified 15 mushiya he says saying touch
[1:14:18] not mine anointed and do my prophets no
[1:14:22] harm
[1:14:23] God said touch not mine anointed why do
[1:14:28] you think the devil can't take your life
[1:14:31] he tries he tries and he tries something
[1:14:36] about that he elected see that was
[1:14:39] predestined from the foundation of the
[1:14:41] world and he cannot put his hand on it
[1:14:46] but can't you see when it gets to a
[1:14:48] place that you realize you don't need
[1:14:51] any power this message says you don't
[1:14:58] have any power you know what you don't
[1:15:02] have any power you never did me
[1:15:05] did I you know what you don't need any
[1:15:09] power all you need is a thority
[1:15:17] hallelujah all's you need is what just
[1:15:21] like that little policeman remembers a
[1:15:23] little frog I and get right in the
[1:15:25] middle the role that science says stop
[1:15:27] Moses with soul has to stop if we know
[1:15:35] who's backing us this morning if we know
[1:15:43] that when we put that sign up to the
[1:15:45] devil that's top devil if you know who's
[1:15:51] backing up it has to stop oh so the
[1:16:04] little Messiah acts that God is called
[1:16:06] forward you know the word Messiah is
[1:16:11] used again in the New Testament there
[1:16:14] and especially the calling out in John
[1:16:17] 1:14 I read this real quick when it
[1:16:19] comes to the New Testament messiahs has
[1:16:21] actually used only one place that we
[1:16:23] find and that's in John 1:14 and it says
[1:16:25] one of the two which heard John speak
[1:16:28] and followed him was Andrew simon Peters
[1:16:30] brother he first findeth his own brother
[1:16:32] Simon and saith unto Him we have found
[1:16:34] the Messiah which is being interpreted
[1:16:37] the Christ so the translation from the
[1:16:43] Hebrew Old Testament to the New
[1:16:46] Testament places the word Messiah is
[1:16:49] actually the Christ so when the word
[1:16:54] Christos is used it's talking about the
[1:16:57] Anointed One that's why we say Jesus
[1:17:00] Christ amen but notice when even our
[1:17:05] opening scripture there in Revelations
[1:17:07] 11:15
[1:17:08] it said the kingdoms of this world are
[1:17:11] become the kingdoms of our
[1:17:13] Lord and of his Christ who is that
[1:17:19] Christ do you feel like that
[1:17:26] I wonder if Jesus walking down the road
[1:17:33] said boy I wish God was around me he was
[1:17:44] the word and once
[1:17:46] now notice because we have Jesus Christ
[1:17:49] living infinite flesh it could be killed
[1:17:53] and this is what I like said I'm talking
[1:17:57] about but then right when he got
[1:18:00] baptized and the Duff came down and
[1:18:04] filled him it was a walk things started
[1:18:10] happening he had a will to live out you
[1:18:16] know what do you think obviously we know
[1:18:18] you know Jesus Christ he rejoiced when
[1:18:20] he seed when it when he when he seen the
[1:18:22] names that written on the book and so
[1:18:24] forth and and and and he was so excited
[1:18:26] when when he seen souls coming and and
[1:18:28] those things were there but but I wonder
[1:18:30] if while he was on that journey walking
[1:18:33] with the Holy Ghost I wonder if there
[1:18:36] was there was a time where the Holy
[1:18:37] Ghost wasn't the Holy Ghost only when it
[1:18:40] came to a death I find it so ironic that
[1:18:48] were here living on this earth in this
[1:18:51] season and we don't realize that the
[1:18:58] season of
[1:18:58] the cost is not over you realize the
[1:19:02] Feast of Pentecost does not end until
[1:19:04] the feast day of atonement and the
[1:19:06] trumpets the feast trumpets so what's
[1:19:15] the feast of Pentecost that's when the
[1:19:17] Holy Ghost is in you you see we come
[1:19:21] back around and and and and I told my
[1:19:23] church awhile ago I said I said we all
[1:19:25] those act like we're in the Acts age
[1:19:26] except we don't have the same
[1:19:28] persecution well beat up wait they were
[1:19:34] carrying all this great burden
[1:19:38] do you realize even with two million
[1:19:42] demons added it does not change the fact
[1:19:45] that Jesus Christ and his powers
[1:19:47] omnipotent and the worst that he can do
[1:19:52] is still nothing compared to who he is
[1:19:55] and the only thing that really separates
[1:20:01] us from becoming what we need to become
[1:20:04] is the fact that we don't have the
[1:20:07] revelation of who we are how can we sit
[1:20:13] here scared and nervous
[1:20:14] [Music]
[1:20:16] hallelujah
[1:20:17] looking at the news and all these things
[1:20:19] like that watching oh oh what's the mall
[1:20:21] gonna hold we know what tomorrow holds
[1:20:24] amen
[1:20:25] we know that Christ is at the helm amen
[1:20:28] we know he said not one thing can be out
[1:20:31] of cater amen
[1:20:32] not one thing we know who's got the
[1:20:37] wheel now let's go let me read you
[1:20:46] another one Messiah 1661 a twenty nine
[1:20:50] he says so if he was called Messiah
[1:20:54] which he was because he was anointed
[1:20:57] with that holy spirit and any church
[1:21:00] that's anointed with the same holy
[1:21:03] spirit is a messiah at a little
[1:21:10] smaller God and someday when this body
[1:21:15] is resurrected I hope before him that
[1:21:18] God can get ahold of a bunch of people
[1:21:21] that will manifest his power in every
[1:21:24] dimension that it's supposed to be in
[1:21:27] the seven dimensions and that Masonic
[1:21:32] anointing on the bride will manifest
[1:21:36] power in every dimension it's supposed
[1:21:40] to be at light matter time hallelujah
[1:21:49] and then watch that dimension of the
[1:21:51] demons in the fourth realm and TV waves
[1:21:54] and everything oh I wonder if it's
[1:21:56] supposed to be there
[1:21:57] don't you know every devilish subject
[1:21:59] amen
[1:22:00] under the feet of Jesus Christ amen you
[1:22:03] are more than a conqueror hallelujah
[1:22:08] think about this even in the dimension
[1:22:12] of the sense where the believers go if
[1:22:15] one of them dies and transforms into
[1:22:18] that dimension if the power God be in
[1:22:21] you and you pray on their milk on my
[1:22:23] back we still believe
[1:22:36] heard a story about an atheist died and
[1:22:40] found him go himself going to hell and
[1:22:44] in the middle of the experience I don't
[1:22:49] know if his Jesus Christ or an angel son
[1:22:51] said come it's not time for you and
[1:22:52] you're not going here and he came back
[1:22:55] to life was married to an atheist he
[1:22:59] said Jesus Christ is real He gave His
[1:23:02] life to Jesus Christ this on a nominal
[1:23:04] level brother sister gave his life to
[1:23:07] Jesus Christ started preaching the
[1:23:10] gospel and his spouse left him because
[1:23:12] she was an atheist and still didn't
[1:23:14] believe it like knows name I like to
[1:23:20] tell about the message hallelujah let's
[1:23:23] go higher but we're living in a day
[1:23:28] brother sister get on YouTube you watch
[1:23:30] that what Muslims are having visions
[1:23:33] that Jesus Christ is the real Savior
[1:23:37] we're living in a moment God is what
[1:23:40] beginning to change the scene and we can
[1:23:47] sit there and let it change in our myths
[1:23:48] or we can become what the word has
[1:23:51] ordained us to be now notice he says now
[1:23:58] you don't have to die to get this you
[1:24:03] have to spiritually die I wonder how
[1:24:06] much Laodicea has been in our lives this
[1:24:10] is really what's really keeping us out
[1:24:12] he says the inside is where God gets
[1:24:15] into control you and as he presses
[1:24:21] himself forward in you don't let any
[1:24:25] root of bitterness hatred malice strife
[1:24:28] that will run him right back again
[1:24:32] notice how many long we've been in this
[1:24:35] the Holy Ghost has been ruling on you
[1:24:39] pressing pressing trying to take you
[1:24:44] over
[1:24:47] he's pushing can any of us say he hasn't
[1:24:51] been we know he is but then watch how
[1:24:54] the devil comes contrary and I'll bring
[1:24:58] a little root of bitterness by Sabri
[1:25:00] moved out by he'll what he'll rot it'll
[1:25:03] come back against what God is trying to
[1:25:08] do and we forfeit the press of the Holy
[1:25:15] Ghost hatred malice strife he says
[1:25:20] that'll run him right back again oh I
[1:25:22] wonder how many times we've went right
[1:25:24] back to Laodicea even being in this
[1:25:27] message when God wants to make you an
[1:25:31] amateur God you realize your prophet
[1:25:37] said he said the seal of the Tree of
[1:25:38] Life was broke at Calvary you can go
[1:25:43] back to Eden right now walking in the
[1:25:49] cool of the evening with the land
[1:25:55] you see we're waiting on something and
[1:25:58] whatever and we're way old Terry Terry
[1:26:00] Terry
[1:26:02] let's go carrying to this remember as
[1:26:05] the Prophet talked about the Messiah
[1:26:07] asked in question answer 64 he said a
[1:26:10] perfect time was Elijah and Elijah when
[1:26:15] Elijah was getting raptured
[1:26:19] go back in the scripture and see what
[1:26:23] Elijah did to Elijah on all four stages
[1:26:30] the three stages the moving to Jordan he
[1:26:33] comes to him Elijah says you I'll not
[1:26:35] leave you
[1:26:36] and every single time Elijah says tarry
[1:26:39] here
[1:26:40] tarry here just wait here you're just
[1:26:42] fine right here just wait just wait you
[1:26:49] can wait a justification your prophet
[1:26:51] type those are three works of grace you
[1:26:55] be this way to justification don't worry
[1:26:57] I'm some time
[1:26:59] sit around in sanctification yeah yeah
[1:27:01] you'll be anointed sometime oh yeah yeah
[1:27:04] you got the Holy Ghost you apparently
[1:27:06] got baptized you're good to go just stay
[1:27:09] right there
[1:27:10] he said the Jordan he said it was a type
[1:27:13] of the dying out hallelujah
[1:27:21] and then what he Elijah every single
[1:27:24] time he said I will not leave them
[1:27:27] you've got to set your face towards
[1:27:29] Christ say I will not leaving I'm not
[1:27:35] satisfied with this type of a church
[1:27:37] with this type of a church experience I
[1:27:40] want the world has seen the true
[1:27:42] resurrected Jesus Christ amen the
[1:27:46] message did not die out and William Adam
[1:27:49] the message did not die out once he was
[1:27:54] off the same the message was Jesus
[1:28:00] Christ and he said he would be in you so
[1:28:12] he says just get all the meanness
[1:28:16] anybody got any meanness he's telling
[1:28:20] you how to become a mess i an't
[1:28:22] get that rid of bitterness and get that
[1:28:24] strife out he says get all the meanness
[1:28:27] and the superstitions

[1:31:52] we weren't gonna stop but I just got to
[1:31:58] ask you guys something
[1:32:00] so I said okay we guys got going on he's
[1:32:05] like we were driving by this church here
[1:32:07] on Christmas Eve he said it was 11
[1:32:11] o'clock at night and he said as I was
[1:32:15] getting close I was driving home from my
[1:32:16] friend's house here with my sister and
[1:32:19] we drove and he said I could see the
[1:32:21] church then they got a big light right
[1:32:22] out front he said and there was this man
[1:32:24] standing right in front of the church he
[1:32:25] said he was 4 foot tall
[1:32:26] he said shoulders are about this wide
[1:32:28] and and he was just standing there he
[1:32:30] said he's just a black just dressed in
[1:32:33] black a black face everything was black
[1:32:37] and he said I I looked at my sister I
[1:32:41] said sister do you see that do you see
[1:32:43] that his sister couldn't see it he said
[1:32:45] so like I came in as I was driving
[1:32:47] closer I slowed down he said I just
[1:32:49] sustained he said I'm so shocked I'm
[1:32:50] like 11:30 at night and this thing
[1:32:52] sitting here and he said all of a sudden
[1:32:53] he said he said it looked at like it
[1:32:55] seen him he said and then that black
[1:32:58] creature it turned around and I ran
[1:33:00] right into the church and disappeared
[1:33:03] he's like no it sounds crazy
[1:33:09] what do you guys think that was I'm with
[1:33:14] these Baptist fellas I can't believe
[1:33:15] they're coming but the I just kind of
[1:33:17] looked at he jump right in he said he
[1:33:18] said well I know what that was he said
[1:33:23] it was a big dog and the guy said it
[1:33:27] wasn't a dog it was a human he said he
[1:33:30] ran
[1:33:30] toward the church and disappear the guy
[1:33:34] said well I'm pretty sure it was a dog
[1:33:38] so I sat back like Ella who his son
[1:33:41] jumped then he said he said well I'll
[1:33:43] tell you exactly what it was it was a
[1:33:45] big turkey but they don't believe in
[1:33:49] supernatural you know what I mean they
[1:33:50] don't know I'm sitting here like oh God
[1:33:54] of mercy and I'm sitting there like
[1:33:56] ding-ding-ding go go and so they got
[1:34:04] done the guys like it wasn't no turkey
[1:34:05] it was a man but it didn't even have a
[1:34:08] face and so I looked at him I said well
[1:34:12] y'all won't know what that was
[1:34:14] I'll tell you exactly what it was it was
[1:34:16] a demon I said let me tell you a story
[1:34:23] so I started telling them some of the
[1:34:24] stories I've seen demons quite a bit too
[1:34:26] much for my own liking I'd like to see
[1:34:28] angels instead though not the fallen
[1:34:29] ones but the real ones I'm looking
[1:34:31] forward to that cuz I know it's coming I
[1:34:33] know it's in the midst right now
[1:34:34] hallelujah we were meant to see angels
[1:34:37] amen you know your prophet said if you
[1:34:39] could get your house in order you'll see
[1:34:41] angels there come on
[1:34:43] we know these quotes you see but you're
[1:34:46] never gonna see in there if you got the
[1:34:47] world and you got your phones telling
[1:34:49] you these things these things wooing you
[1:34:52] to sleep putting all sorts of junk in
[1:34:56] your in your eyes and you know your eyes
[1:34:58] are the gateway to your soul Christ said
[1:35:00] you have to be a single in the eye
[1:35:04] single you got to look to the one that's
[1:35:09] why in the Old Testament they would wear
[1:35:11] for luxuries and they'd have that flat
[1:35:13] tree but right on the head write down
[1:35:14] the word would be in the little scroll
[1:35:16] right there and every time they'd have a
[1:35:18] certain verse that it is look right up
[1:35:19] at it where like there they see the word
[1:35:22] was always be far there so I told the
[1:35:28] story and then the Baptist fell on his
[1:35:30] son and I go okay we gotta go I mean
[1:35:32] they were they were gone cuz then the
[1:35:36] story God took me to a place told me
[1:35:39] where the demon was that and I cast it
[1:35:41] out in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:35:43] last he still does that to de amen
[1:35:48] not just to me through you hallelujah
[1:35:52] the weakest Christian puts the devil on
[1:35:54] his knees they met hallelujah his doctor
[1:35:59] believed Amen it's time to get unbelief
[1:36:02] out so I talked to these gentlemen for
[1:36:09] after they ran out it's just me and them
[1:36:11] then hit him up with a mess you cheat
[1:36:14] him up with everything and balls in
[1:36:17] their court now but I come back around I
[1:36:21] say God all you really wanting me to do
[1:36:24] it's just talk to you listen to you see
[1:36:32] why can't we be effective even in our
[1:36:34] churches for the sister don't you
[1:36:35] realize you were made for nine spiritual
[1:36:37] gifts you were made your prophets that
[1:36:41] you are made to have the pillar of fire
[1:36:43] right here everyone expressing the word
[1:36:46] right here each and every one of you but
[1:36:52] I'll tell you what when it looks
[1:36:53] effective you take it home with you
[1:36:57] watch that atmosphere put the devil to
[1:37:00] run hallelujah Hey how we gonna get our
[1:37:05] family members don't you realize that's
[1:37:08] why God has you they're not getting to
[1:37:15] my head and playing even though I kind
[1:37:16] of have hallelujah we're gonna try to
[1:37:20] close pretty soon here because I know
[1:37:21] it's it's it's already been I've been 45
[1:37:24] minutes but we start really late but I
[1:37:27] want you to see this as we go just slow
[1:37:30] a bit farther because I want you to see
[1:37:31] this idea because it lives out for you
[1:37:35] remember you are made in the likeness
[1:37:37] and image of God when Jesus Christ came
[1:37:43] that was God in flesh you know he looked
[1:37:45] like he looked just like you like I said
[1:37:51] in the
[1:37:51] Davi could get a headache he was human
[1:37:55] just like you but you see he had an
[1:38:05] image and likeness and I want you to
[1:38:08] know you're not just in his image you're
[1:38:11] in his likeness now I want to turn a
[1:38:16] corner with you really quick here
[1:38:18] because I want you to see Jesus's plant
[1:38:21] that he was living out let's go on our
[1:38:27] Bibles to mark 13 earth mark 3:13 notice
[1:38:32] early on in mark here see if we hardly
[1:38:44] have enough fervor to get to the house
[1:38:45] of God how do we expect other people to
[1:38:48] come fall in love with the God do you
[1:38:49] have this has to change my church has to
[1:38:53] change I have to change I have to
[1:38:55] realize that every time I'm gathered
[1:38:57] with the children of God we got a
[1:39:00] wildfire right there and if I got to
[1:39:03] bring the big fire I'll bring it if
[1:39:05] somebody else bring it let them bring it
[1:39:07] whoever's going to bring it let them
[1:39:09] bring it amen and I'll tell you what I
[1:39:12] walked in here and there's people up
[1:39:14] here praying how you gotta get it
[1:39:19] hallelujah you ain't coming in here for
[1:39:22] it for the Word of God to get your sin
[1:39:23] away you're supposed to come in here
[1:39:25] with the sonority put away and praying
[1:39:27] for the spiritual manifest himself right
[1:39:30] here we come in the church and we leave
[1:39:34] church too many times with the same
[1:39:37] sicknesses the same oppressions and the
[1:39:41] same depressions on us that we walked in
[1:39:44] with that's not what the house of God is
[1:39:47] for your prophet called this the end
[1:39:50] you're supposed to put the oil and the
[1:39:51] light on in here hallelujah remember
[1:39:56] last time amen there's a while back I
[1:39:58] remember
[1:39:59] hallelujah for the Good Samaritan deity
[1:40:03] he had oil
[1:40:06] the Holy Ghost and the stimulation of
[1:40:09] the wire and that brought healing to the
[1:40:13] wounded to the broken to the sick
[1:40:16] because those who needed freedom and
[1:40:19] I'll tell you that save the Holy Ghost
[1:40:21] is here I map
[1:40:26] so notice mark 313 so Jesus Christ now
[1:40:30] Lou this this is V Messiah and says he
[1:40:33] goes up into a mountain and cloth unto
[1:40:35] Him whom he would and they came unto him
[1:40:37] and he ordained 12 that they should be
[1:40:41] with him and that he might send them
[1:40:44] forth to preach and to have power to
[1:40:48] heal sicknesses and cast out devils I
[1:40:52] want you to notice this here so here it
[1:40:55] is the Messiah and he's actually trying
[1:41:00] hidden plan he's what he's wanting not
[1:41:04] to just be there amongst the people
[1:41:07] doing a work all by himself but he's
[1:41:09] actually trying to activate anointed
[1:41:13] ones in his midst
[1:41:15] now I want you to see this Jesus Christ
[1:41:19] does not go with them he does not go
[1:41:25] with them when he sends the 74 he does
[1:41:28] not go with them now catch this all they
[1:41:34] had was the faith in his word you know
[1:41:39] why
[1:41:40] because they did not have the Holy Ghost
[1:41:46] come on out they just with a faith in
[1:41:54] his word that he told them took that
[1:41:59] word and fulfilled that word to a team
[1:42:05] he was the Messiah activating anointed
[1:42:11] ones in his merits without even the Holy
[1:42:15] Ghost and what the
[1:42:17] do they went out and they did it well
[1:42:23] come on mark sixteen believers these
[1:42:26] signs shall follow them Velma that
[1:42:30] believe a man he can use your hands
[1:42:33] sister a man he could use my patient
[1:42:38] just take a faith in that word you know
[1:42:42] you don't even need the Holy Ghost to
[1:42:44] have this that's how simple it is but I
[1:42:48] say God don't let me have nothing
[1:42:50] without your Holy Ghost just fill me
[1:42:52] with that spirit amen and let that light
[1:42:55] consume me amen
[1:42:59] so what'd he do he sent him forth and
[1:43:05] they did it now this is what I want you
[1:43:07] to see mark 3:19 moved just a little bit
[1:43:11] down so it tells you which ones come
[1:43:14] forth now I want you to see this Jesus
[1:43:17] Christ life was lived in such an
[1:43:20] anonymity look at this why you saying
[1:43:24] that brother mark 3:19 and Judas
[1:43:35] Iscariot which also betrayed him and
[1:43:37] they went into a house and the multitude
[1:43:41] cometh together again so that they could
[1:43:46] not so much as eat bread notice and when
[1:43:51] his friends heard of it Jesus's friends
[1:43:54] they went out to lay hold on him for
[1:43:59] they said he is beside himself Jesus
[1:44:06] Christ lived such an anonymous life in
[1:44:09] their midst that once he started looking
[1:44:14] at Norrington they thought he was crazy
[1:44:20] brother cam why is that important it's
[1:44:25] completely important
[1:44:27] because that's what you've done that's
[1:44:29] what I've done we live lives unless I
[1:44:32] got ten smarter tests away but I'm not
[1:44:33] satisfied I will be unsatisfied I'll um
[1:44:38] sit like this until the rapture but I'll
[1:44:39] tell you what I have to see the living
[1:44:42] Jesus Christ in my life every day and I
[1:44:45] will not be satisfied until I do and I
[1:44:48] pray then fill me with a desperation so
[1:44:51] it never stops you see you don't have to
[1:44:57] sit here and say well I'm a sister God
[1:44:59] can't use me to heal when God actually
[1:45:01] used a sister and brother branham's
[1:45:03] meetings to bring forth a healing to
[1:45:06] another lady's door or little baby when
[1:45:10] she was sick because the mother that was
[1:45:13] called to pray for that little baby had
[1:45:16] compassion you know we need to start
[1:45:22] saying God put me in your path you see
[1:45:26] this word is alive right now it doesn't
[1:45:30] matter how I'm anointed you felt how
[1:45:34] anonymous you feel like you're in your
[1:45:36] life or what people think about you
[1:45:39] you'll only cry should be for Jesus
[1:45:43] Christ fulfill your life amen
[1:45:47] you see what Christ's plan ended up
[1:45:50] sending about March 6 but we find that
[1:45:53] what according to the plan of Christ the
[1:45:58] Messiah sign was actually sent forth
[1:46:00] not just to reveal itself but to
[1:46:02] manifest Messiah it's right in his midst
[1:46:06] why do you think the Prophet brought it
[1:46:09] down like he did why do you think he
[1:46:14] didn't glorify himself why you think he
[1:46:17] didn't say okay show's over once I'm
[1:46:18] gone but he said well
[1:46:22] these signs shall follow them that the
[1:46:24] belief all the way to the end you can't
[1:46:26] undo it you see we get we've heard so
[1:46:32] much Antichrist I must say for it is
[1:46:34] Antichrist preaching against Pentecost
[1:46:36] and the life and spirit of Jesus Christ
[1:46:40] that we what by that by that Antichrist
[1:46:45] where we pull ourselves and say well you
[1:46:46] know that's just for a preacher that's
[1:46:48] what they want you to think and shame on
[1:46:50] if they're doing it I know what I hear
[1:46:54] but I'll tell you he wants to live in
[1:46:59] you that's why that's why brother sister
[1:47:03] this year some of the main show pieces
[1:47:06] of the book of Acts are two deacons not
[1:47:11] even the preachers you know you know
[1:47:13] what God left it in such a place he
[1:47:16] spoke more about Stephen and Philip than
[1:47:18] he did Peter but you can't kick Peter
[1:47:23] out either cuz Peter was so anointed
[1:47:25] that his shadow the people it wasn't
[1:47:30] that there's power in that shadow
[1:47:32] it was the faith of the people in Peter
[1:47:35] they knew God was there that's what we
[1:47:39] need we need the people that are in your
[1:47:42] individual lives to see the walk of God
[1:47:46] afresh in your life and to realize that
[1:47:48] Jesus Christ is the same today in you
[1:47:54] hallelujah hallelujah but we got a
[1:48:01] closer close let me go one more area 61
[1:48:04] 117
[1:48:12] I must skip that
[1:48:20] so I got five sermons on this so you see
[1:48:23] what struggling and a half I cut up I
[1:48:25] cut out a lot a lot but I want you to
[1:48:28] catch the main point the time is now for
[1:48:33] us to look I don't have to tell you this
[1:48:35] it's in the message and it's in the Word
[1:48:38] of God see what I'm saying I'm showing
[1:48:41] you what is obvious fact to the believer
[1:48:47] but you have to realize that you
[1:48:49] personally are made to know God why are
[1:48:56] your attributes being made manifest now
[1:48:58] for fellowship your prophet said that
[1:49:00] you're here right now for fellowship you
[1:49:05] know your prophet said he said one of
[1:49:08] the worst mistakes that I've made is
[1:49:10] that I just haven't waited on God at
[1:49:13] much I wonder how many times that we sit
[1:49:17] back and we're just not really you know
[1:49:18] what well let's say our prayer and we'll
[1:49:21] roll it out but I wonder how often that
[1:49:23] we just say okay God what are you gonna
[1:49:25] say and then we set up shop they that
[1:49:32] wait on the Lord shall renew their
[1:49:35] strength they shall mount up like Eagles
[1:49:40] they go a little bit farther Matthew
[1:49:43] 14:24 we're closing this passage because
[1:49:49] I want you to maybe I'll get that
[1:49:51] tonight maybe I won't you'll go
[1:49:55] somewhere else though Lucy where's that
[1:49:57] God to God how about it
[1:49:58] amen so notice so Jesus Christ lived a
[1:50:08] life where he was manifesting the
[1:50:13] supernatural
[1:50:14] never agree with that no I want you to
[1:50:18] think did Jesus Christ ever manifest
[1:50:25] something that you can't on the
[1:50:31] supernatural realm let's let's talk
[1:50:39] about this he cursed the fig tree
[1:50:42] Matthew 21 he cursed the fig tree and
[1:50:48] the fig tree withered and but I want you
[1:50:51] to see this because they didn't have the
[1:50:53] Holy Ghost and the scripture says and
[1:50:54] they marveled they marveled wow this is
[1:50:57] amazing and what did Jesus say them he
[1:51:10] said he said what I've done to the fig
[1:51:14] tree you'll also do but if you say unto
[1:51:19] this mountain be thou removed plucked up
[1:51:21] and cast in the sea it shall be you not
[1:51:23] was standing right I'm paraphrasing yeah
[1:51:28] he told his disciples you could curse a
[1:51:32] fig tree and it has to die he said if
[1:51:38] you said under the mountain be moved it
[1:51:40] would move I'm gonna take you in this
[1:51:42] portion here because I want you to see
[1:51:43] it you are not on anointed blobs and the
[1:51:47] Laodicean age come on now then we just
[1:51:52] kind of this blob around boom you're
[1:51:54] prophesied we're like a bump on a log
[1:51:55] oh just go into Church oh I believe the
[1:51:58] message no no where you go brother
[1:52:01] that's where God's going what's he got
[1:52:05] in front of you the anointed but this is
[1:52:17] the truth cuz I want you to see this
[1:52:19] when he said to that tree
[1:52:21] he said pluck it out I said all he was
[1:52:23] doing was what he was showing he was
[1:52:29] showing the Garden of Eden sonship
[1:52:35] his disciples that is literally what he
[1:52:38] was doing so also he was showing you is
[1:52:42] what a son or daughter of God can do
[1:52:46] come on now I can prove through you
[1:52:49] through the scripture all the way
[1:52:50] absolutely no problem it's there your
[1:52:55] prophet said it he said earlier in the
[1:52:57] sermon all Jesus Christ was doing was
[1:53:01] revealing a word but I want you to see
[1:53:04] this that that if you say in this
[1:53:06] mountain be thou removed mark 11 there
[1:53:08] and plucked up and cast in the sea and
[1:53:11] you're not doubting it shall happen that
[1:53:13] was the scripture that stumped the
[1:53:14] Prophet his whole life so what are you
[1:53:19] saying
[1:53:19] the revelation was not made manifest
[1:53:24] until the seventh angel was manifested
[1:53:27] and then God could give the revelation
[1:53:30] to the seventh angel that this word
[1:53:33] doesn't need to stump you but this word
[1:53:37] is actually only what you are touch
[1:53:49] Matthew 14:24 read with me he says he
[1:53:53] said but the ship was now in the midst
[1:53:54] of the sea tossed with waves for the
[1:53:56] wind was contrary our coming now and in
[1:53:59] the fourth watch of the night Jesus went
[1:54:02] unto them walking on the sea Jesus is
[1:54:08] walking on the sea why you know he was
[1:54:16] the Messiah
[1:54:18] of course I'm reading this for reason
[1:54:22] you know and the disciples saw him
[1:54:26] walking on the sea and they were
[1:54:28] troubled notice when they seen the
[1:54:31] manifestation of that war it troubled
[1:54:34] them they were not comfortable with it
[1:54:42] well sure they didn't know what sonship
[1:54:47] was
[1:54:50] they didn't know what atom possessed
[1:54:56] come on
[1:54:57] no notice they were trouble saying it is
[1:55:00] a spirit and they cried out for fear we
[1:55:05] have so much fear in our myths right now
[1:55:07] your prophet said four times in the
[1:55:09] message he said he said 80% of the
[1:55:11] people in his preaching place he said
[1:55:12] 80% of the people in this room have
[1:55:13] issue with nervousness I wonder if I
[1:55:16] could say 80% here or 90 or zero they
[1:55:24] scared enough in hallelujah only I want
[1:55:27] is a good fear of God amen hallelujah
[1:55:31] notice and that straightway Jesus spake
[1:55:34] unto them so notice they were scared at
[1:55:37] this manifestation of sonship but what
[1:55:42] would calm them now a little bit of the
[1:55:44] word the revealed word now I want you to
[1:55:49] see is this powerful he says Jesus Vader
[1:55:52] I'm saying be of good cheer be happy
[1:55:55] about this this is great really it is I
[1:56:02] be not afraid this is what we have to
[1:56:05] catch if this comes to you it's not you
[1:56:11] it's him I'm looking one direction as I
[1:56:16] close okay I feel it now he says and
[1:56:20] Peter answered him and said now I want
[1:56:22] you to see this who is Peter Peters a
[1:56:25] man without the Holy Ghost Peters a man
[1:56:30] he stepped in to deny Christ three times
[1:56:32] really look silly here he's gonna cut
[1:56:37] somebody zero all that is laying inside
[1:56:42] of him and looked at Peter right here
[1:56:45] before all this comes and Peter answered
[1:56:52] him and said so notice all Jesus said
[1:56:57] was in his I be not afraid that's all he
[1:57:00] says all he says
[1:57:02] Oh lease s look and Peter answered him
[1:57:05] and said lord if it be that okay bid me
[1:57:10] come unto thee on the water well that's
[1:57:15] only for the Messiah Peter back off
[1:57:18] that's just for the Messiah now I want
[1:57:22] you to see this this is critical then it
[1:57:25] comes through a place that God what do
[1:57:29] you think made Peter do that that bride
[1:57:34] seed of election on the inside of him
[1:57:38] but will we these won't be a showboat
[1:57:41] he wasn't wanting to be a Szabo he was
[1:57:45] only crying out to what he was he was a
[1:57:54] son of God made for the traits and
[1:58:00] conditions that the first Adam had the
[1:58:06] first Adam was a living soul now notice
[1:58:14] so what does Jesus tell between diverse
[1:58:17] and he said come and when Peter was come
[1:58:20] down out of the ship he walked on the
[1:58:23] water to go to Jesus
[1:58:26] all he had to do was hear the war come
[1:58:29] what do you think you're waiting for
[1:58:31] when when when when we're waiting for
[1:58:33] come up hither he identified with Christ
[1:58:41] now I want you to see this
[1:58:43] he knew what Christ could do he seen
[1:58:49] crisis do this and what did say
[1:58:50] something inside him said you can do the
[1:58:52] same thing did he have the
[1:58:57] no you see I'm saying we are living so
[1:59:05] underprivileged remember it really does
[1:59:11] come down and I'm not proud I can get
[1:59:13] that far it comes down to motives and
[1:59:15] objectives this is why we pray God put
[1:59:17] me where you want me to put me because
[1:59:19] whatever mountain stands in front of you
[1:59:22] we're packing oh I don't have the Holy
[1:59:26] Ghost I can't do nothing that's not
[1:59:28] factual at all I'll tell you what maybe
[1:59:29] if God let you do this maybe you would
[1:59:31] get the Holy Ghost you shall say maybe
[1:59:34] you'd realize he's real enough to fill
[1:59:36] you with his presence and that he wants
[1:59:39] to remember your prophet said he says
[1:59:43] like a standing foot pipe all the way
[1:59:45] into this face and the water that lays
[1:59:47] in it trying to get out on a leak at the
[1:59:50] very bottom that is the pressure that
[1:59:53] God wants to fill you with his spirit he
[1:59:57] wants you to be like this that bad see
[2:00:02] I'm saying I'm not running through the
[2:00:05] river when I'm done understand I'm
[2:00:07] saying but what I'm saying is whatever
[2:00:09] mountains in front of me this is what I
[2:00:11] got to see so notice and Peter was come
[2:00:18] down out of the ship and he walked on
[2:00:20] the water to go to Jesus and but when he
[2:00:22] saw the wind boisterous he was afraid
[2:00:27] and he began to sink he cried saying
[2:00:29] lord save me and immediately Jesus
[2:00:32] stretched forth his hand and caught him
[2:00:34] and said unto Him o thou of little faith
[2:00:36] wherefore didst thou doubt I'll talk to
[2:00:40] you why he was doubting he didn't have
[2:00:43] the Holy Ghost he did not have the faith
[2:00:46] of Christ inside of him amen that's why
[2:00:49] you don't see those failures in the book
[2:00:51] of Acts that's why when you get in the
[2:00:57] book of Acts you see shadows healing
[2:00:59] does he fill up translating hey my drive
[2:01:03] would be a lot better if the Lord woke
[2:01:04] me up this morning said just say the
[2:01:06] word brother but
[2:01:10] has to be for a purpose how do I know
[2:01:13] there's not a soul in the way I'm
[2:01:14] supposed to go talk to but you see if we
[2:01:20] never get our self away from our purpose
[2:01:21] we can never see sonship so the first
[2:01:25] Adam was made a living soul but the
[2:01:26] second Adam was made a quickening spirit
[2:01:28] quickening spirit if he was a quickening
[2:01:32] spirit
[2:01:33] where is he quickening at inside of you
[2:01:36] I see it I see I'm telling you I'm
[2:01:47] watching God do stuff right now like I
[2:01:48] haven't seen Oh a long time but I it's
[2:01:53] it's all me because I see the more I let
[2:01:55] my flesh live the less it goes out God
[2:01:57] told me to have to do something three
[2:01:59] weeks ago right when all this stuff was
[2:02:00] happening and something has said don't
[2:02:02] you go
[2:02:03] you shouldn't go you sneeze stay home
[2:02:05] and I did and since then I feel like
[2:02:08] I've been fighting to get back and I
[2:02:11] thought I said you know what I went and
[2:02:13] I had two issues attack my bodily me
[2:02:16] bodily immediately and now I'm sitting
