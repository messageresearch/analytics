[28:29] Simon to come few weeks ago I forgot
[28:32] about it
[28:33] that's alright let you know about that
[28:35] so forgive me but yesterday I had a
[28:37] reunion get our 20-year reunion from
[28:39] high school when he won the state
[28:41] championship and I set up the whole
[28:43] event and did all this work my whole
[28:46] point was to share about Christ and I
[28:49] got to last about 50 or 60 people of God
[28:53] gave me those athletic abilities to
[28:55] bring me to Akron just to be a pastor I
[28:57] don't think God really cares about
[28:58] football the track knows nothing in the
[29:01] scripture that says you get a reward
[29:05] nothing if the Bible says that crowd
[29:09] fades away there was a heavenly crowd
[29:13] that's winning souls for Jesus Christ so
[29:17] I got to share about the church here and
[29:19] I gave the example sister Naomi she's
[29:21] not here but she moved from Ghana to
[29:23] Akron 5560 one mile she flew and she was
[29:29] worried I'm gonna lose my faith and I
[29:31] there's no churches there that believe
[29:32] what we believe you know like holding
[29:33] this Holy Ghost
[29:37] and she just um I don't even know where
[29:39] accurate is there's not even a church
[29:40] here and then she found out about a year
[29:42] later that there was a church here as I
[29:44] said I knew that's one more proof that
[29:46] God set me the acronym to be a pastor to
[29:48] feed his sheep by the grace of the Lord
[29:50] so I got to share that was about you
[29:52] know 50 people last night I just said if
[29:54] anybody wants to know Jesus Christ
[29:56] please contact me no one has yet I'm
[29:59] going to keep contacting them sometimes
[30:00] you got to chase them down sometimes you
[30:03] got to go after the Sheep I'm gonna keep
[30:05] doing that by the grace of God so so
[30:08] happy because Simon could come and
[30:10] minister here we're looking forward to
[30:12] it
[30:12] grace of God I'm gonna the Lord today

[34:20] Mike McCluskey's house and I taught on
[34:24] the cleft of the rock
[34:26] and that's a that's a powerful to me is
[34:29] it really gave me hope that if you're
[34:33] done dying a dead condition a dried-out
[34:37] condition you just have to get to the
[34:39] cleft of the rock and right there is the
[34:43] only place you can get back the joy or
[34:47] life anyhow if we could turn to
[34:51] Deuteronomy 30 verse 15 for the malachi
[34:56] in the back running the show by the

[35:30] conceive pretty decent really good and I
[35:32] just I just kind of I just harmony
[35:38] Deuteronomy 30 verse 15 see I have set
[35:44] before thee this day life and good and
[35:49] death and evil so God is saying he's I
[35:52] right here I'm placing both life and
[35:56] death now it rests on you in this
[36:02] commandment thee in in that I command
[36:05] thee this day to love the Lord thy God
[36:07] he says to walk in his ways and to keep
[36:10] his Commandments and his statutes and
[36:12] his judgments that that thou may a slim
[36:15] and multiply yes and the LORD thy God
[36:20] shall bless thee in the land whither
[36:23] thou goest to possess but if thy heart
[36:25] be turned away so that I will not hear
[36:28] but shall be drawn away look a great
[36:31] falling away and worship other gods and
[36:36] serve them i denounce unto you this day
[36:39] that thou shalt
[36:40] surely perish and that thou shall not
[36:43] prolong your days upon the land whither
[36:45] thou passes over Jordan go to possess it
[36:47] he says these things but notice where he
[36:50] goes the very next verse I call heaven
[36:55] and earth to record this day against you
[37:01] that I have set before you life and
[37:04] death blessing and cursing therefore
[37:07] choose life that thou that that that

[38:43] with cancer slowly dying we've had two
[38:47] surgeries prayed and prayed spoke the
[38:52] Word of God with faith and
[38:54] prayed and spoke the word and prayed and
[38:58] God was silent and I didn't have any
[39:04] more money for another surgery that
[39:06] cancer is a very aggressive cancer right
[39:09] back I have no children so this was my
[39:11] child had mercy on me that was my baby
[39:18] the Lord took her Wednesday night he
[39:21] watched her fade for the last two weeks
[39:24] to where she wouldn't eat she would
[39:27] hardly drink she waited until I got home
[39:32] from work Wednesday knowing Church is
[39:35] coming up I don't want to leave her I
[39:36] laid beside her for a good hour and 15
[39:40] then I said me I told my wife I said it
[39:42] man maybe we should take her outside two
[39:45] days before that she took all the rest
[39:46] of her energy that strength she had and
[39:48] she she spent the entire day outside
[39:50] just looking around laying there
[39:53] labored breathing for almost three weeks
[39:56] just barely breathe and God took her I
[40:00] took her outside looked at the chickens
[40:04] and you know I held her and then we went
[40:08] back in set her down she was standing
[40:11] barely standing
[40:14] not sure I'm sharing this just want to
[40:16] let you know the that we have one
[40:19] another we don't know when if this will
[40:21] be our last time together as the man of
[40:23] God the prophetess day he'd always say
[40:25] at the end of service during service he
[40:27] says he says we may never meet here
[40:29] again but we will he said on the other
[40:31] side be encouraged God is faithful I
[40:38] watched her go I watched her take her
[40:40] last breaths and it was very very
[40:43] painful to watch death amen the last
[40:49] time my dog died another dog here her
[40:52] sister died my dad said I hate life I
[40:55] said no dad you hate death dying is not
[40:59] part of life life is life life is
[41:03] eternal if you find the right source
[41:07] my dad hates death and I hate death as
[41:11] well so be enough keep us in prayers
[41:15] we're just trying to move on you know
[41:17] believing God it's still very very
[41:19] tender spot but I kind of want to teach
[41:24] this because I want to see my dog again
[41:28] the man of God the Prophet went over
[41:31] took behind the curtain of time and he
[41:32] saw Fritz right there his dog that the
[41:35] policeman had killed poisoned right I'm
[41:39] leaving on these things so today I'd
[41:40] like to teach on your testimony versus
[41:44] the Earth's testimony the Bible says God
[41:51] said you can live or you can die and he
[41:54] said I call heaven and earth against you
[41:56] this day to record a diss against you in
[42:01] proverbs 6 verse 6 the Bible says go to
[42:07] the ant he says thou sluggard so God now
[42:11] he says he says examine this little
[42:13] portion of creation these little
[42:16] insignificant things you can walk
[42:18] through the day you can walk over
[42:20] concrete you can walk through dirt and
[42:22] chances are you won't see the ant why
[42:25] cause it's so tiny it's so miniscule
[42:28] absolutely but that ant is displaying a
[42:31] character that many people in this age
[42:33] know nothing about the ant is a worker
[42:38] the ant prepares for the winner
[42:42] constantly digging out new holes
[42:44] planting new colonies absolutely they
[42:47] work and work and work and I from a
[42:51] science I hear they can barely even see
[42:52] and yet they work and they work and they
[42:54] go by a sense and God says go to the ant
[43:00] thou sluggard consider her ways and be
[43:03] wise a man he says which have no guide
[43:08] he says overseer or ruler he says
[43:11] provide us her meat in the summer and
[43:14] gathered food in what in the harvest
[43:16] prepping absolutely making sure they
[43:18] take care little baby
[43:20] the little ones popping out of the eggs
[43:21] oh yeah absolutely what they prepare for
[43:24] their own they they're working machines
[43:26] absolutely how long without sleep o
[43:30] sluggard when that arise out of thy
[43:33] sleep you won't know how to work he says
[43:36] look at the ant he says that nature will
[43:39] teach you right there your testimony
[43:44] versus the earth and Isaiah 1 verse 2 he
[43:49] says hear o heavens and give ear o earth
[43:52] for the Lord has spoken he says I have
[43:55] nourished and brought up thy children
[43:57] and they have rebelled against me God
[43:59] dealt with Israel or the nation call him
[44:02] out he says he he says your mind the
[44:04] Bible said that Israel was God's
[44:06] firstborn right a firstborn son the
[44:10] firstborn son is the is the special one
[44:12] oh my um I hope number 4 got all the
[44:21] heights and looks speed and a billion
[44:24] fly 24 feet praise the Lord
[44:31] amen he says but Lukey says the Ox knows
[44:34] his owner he says and they ask his
[44:37] master's crib he says but Israel does
[44:40] not know my people nor consider oh my
[44:45] god saying I dealt with Israel he but
[44:48] they don't even understand it they are
[44:49] mine but he says look at these animals
[44:52] he says the Ox in the ass he says they
[44:54] know who their master is oh my yes sir
[44:58] my pups when I come home of my cats they
[45:01] greet me right outside of my little work
[45:03] van because I they know I'm their master
[45:06] and I'm gonna give him a treat am i
[45:09] laying down the pen a little bit but
[45:11] they know who the master is of the house
[45:14] he said but Israel had lost that ability
[45:16] to discern who the master is amazing God
[45:24] examining he says just go look at nature
[45:28] on the earth
[45:32] in the book of Job 12 God speaks to me a
[45:39] lot of times in nature right before the
[45:42] last time I went to Thailand I was
[45:43] walking on a jobsite and a certain scene
[45:46] in nature was going on and it caught my
[45:48] attention and I go over what is to this
[45:52] workers walking past me this way that
[45:54] way I'm standing in my hard hat and I'm
[45:56] just sitting here watching us little
[45:57] these insects do a certain thing
[46:00] next up there for ten minutes and I said
[46:03] what is gonna happen next one week into
[46:06] Thailand I get a call and it had taken
[46:09] place God teaches in nature be watchful
[46:14] keep your eyes about you as the Prophet
[46:19] the Prophet is that he says he said I
[46:20] catch little things and God shows me to
[46:23] cut what's to come the past or whatever
[46:24] is that just the nature let me give you
[46:29] example and one of the sermons I
[46:32] listened to recently he said he said you
[46:34] examine he says you look at the hawk
[46:36] that bird of prey he says an air Hawk
[46:39] was a strong Hawk at one time it's like
[46:42] high up just like the eagle he says but
[46:46] now I Drive my car he says and I'm
[46:48] looking at a telephone poles and your
[46:50] Hawk rests right on the telephone pole
[46:52] it does not soar looking he just sits
[46:54] there on getting lazy
[46:57] he says lazy on the little telephone
[47:00] poles now on the Turnpike really didn't
[47:02] hit the little fences and you'll see
[47:04] them Hawk sitting him five foot above
[47:07] the ground
[47:08] he said they become lazy right just
[47:14] within this year that's the nature
[47:18] within this year I've seen three Eagles
[47:22] eating roadkill Eagles bald eagles the
[47:30] nation's bird eagle the type of a
[47:34] prophet the eagle one agency yes
[47:38] and now the eagle has got solo or maybe
[47:43] there's so little food out there I don't
[47:45] know but now

[47:48] to stop in the middle road the Eagle
[47:53] eating the worm these things now but
[47:57] it's still an eagle the Bible says God
[47:59] will restore hey man absolutely
[48:08] joke 12 or 7 brother he says but now
[48:13] asked the beasts he says and they shall
[48:16] teach thee
[48:18] he says the fowls of the air and they
[48:21] shall tell thee Omaha they'll tell the
[48:23] condition of church
[48:24] they'll can tell the condition of the
[48:26] Eagles in this land in America they'll
[48:30] teach you keep your eyes open and watch
[48:32] nature this one time

[48:42] or speak to the earth and it shall teach
[48:46] thee how is the earth gonna teach us

[48:56] fishes of the sea and they shall declare
[48:59] it to me to declare unto thee who
[49:02] knoweth not in all these things that the
[49:04] hand is Lord has rosters and whose hand
[49:07] is the soul of every living thing in the
[49:10] breath of all mankind does not the ears
[49:13] try the words and the mouth taste his
[49:15] meat he says listen he says look he says

[51:27] Romans 1 verse 18 now look at this your
[51:33] testimony
[51:34] vs. the earth Romans 1 verse 18 he says
[51:39] for the wrath of God is revealed from
[51:41] heaven against all ungodliness and
[51:43] unrighteousness of men who hold the
[51:46] truth in unrighteousness these are
[51:47] preachers going behind here and uh next
[51:51] service I'm gonna teach specifically on
[51:55] this podium right here on this place
[51:59] yeah a little study God opened up to me
[52:02] and everyone has heard it has been
[52:04] blessed so alright now look at verse 19
[52:09] because that which may be known of God
[52:10] is manifested them so God the things
[52:14] that God wants them to see
[52:15] he says are manifest their seed what in
[52:18] nature they're seen in creation the very
[52:21] thing God wants them to see to what to
[52:23] teach them he's placed before them they
[52:27] don't have to do anything but go outside
[52:30] for God has showed it unto them
[52:34] where did he show it unto them verse 24
[52:38] the invisible things of him from the
[52:40] creation in the world are create clearly
[52:42] seen everything that we need to learn we
[52:47] can look at the things that are already
[52:48] made well from what the invisible
[52:50] invisible the spoken word the
[52:53] vibrational power that come out of God
[52:55] through spoken word now has created
[52:57] everything this wood was a spoken word
[53:00] of God but now it's visible and we can
[53:03] look at it and we can understand what
[53:05] God had in his mind by looking and
[53:06] examining it mrs. wood it's hard as
[53:09] durable we can now make things out of it
[53:11] absolutely
[53:13] but God have we wants to teach you to
[53:16] nature yes he say in for the municipal
[53:21] things of him from creation are clearly
[53:22] seen being understood by the things that
[53:25] are made even now what now what does he
[53:28] want to teach he says he wants to teach
[53:30] what his eternal power how strong he is
[53:33] how mighty is he speaks the word and
[53:35] just go take a vacation for two weeks
[53:37] and just drive and you'll see everything
[53:39] some of the stuff you mean he says he
[53:41] wants to show his power and Godhead amen
[53:46] God what is God is God three persons or
[53:55] one person the Bible says that nature
[53:59] will teach us the earth he says ask the
[54:01] earth ask the beasts he says they'll
[54:03] teach us if there's one God or three me
[54:09] and my old pastor brother Brooks went
[54:10] down to Florida for vacation time four
[54:12] days we went to the Holy Land the Holy
[54:16] Land the experience
[54:20] and we're walking through this holy name
[54:22] experience in Orlando Florida and we
[54:27] walk around everybody's every dressed in
[54:29] the old Bible outfits in this net
[54:31] there's a giant Philistine man that's
[54:33] probably six foot five a Philistine
[54:36] outfit on or boy your outfit and he's
[54:37] just walking around and he starts
[54:39] talking to a little boy we're listening
[54:41] to and he starts talking about Trinity
[54:45] this little boy and I'm watching this
[54:49] guy gun this man all down to this little
[54:51] child he said it's guess he said little
[54:55] boy he said God is like but we should
[54:58] like he says there's the Father Son and
[55:02] Holy Ghost the shell the white and the
[55:06] yolk he said God is like an egg and he's
[55:09] teaching him through nature right but
[55:14] show me one of Scripture right that Tice
[55:18] God is a name I thought that before
[55:24] wouldn't that that's a chicken mentality
[55:37] you take an egg that has not been with
[55:40] the male little rocks and I can that be
[55:43] a soccer ball right but give life in
[55:46] nature yeah scripture after scripture
[55:50] after scripture the Bible declares that
[55:52] God is like the s UN is the Sun of
[56:04] righteousness what brings the light is
[56:09] the SU n how many su ways are in the sky
[56:13] one
[56:24] and there sometimes you wish you could
[56:26] just go back and just take the sword and
[56:28] slay and don't eat so God says these
[56:37] things are evident God teaches in nature
[56:42] yes the gospel has went from the east to
[56:47] the west thank the Lord because we're
[56:50] the last recipients of the gospel here
[56:53] in America oh my
[56:55] it started in Jerusalem and made its way
[56:58] all the way study history look at all
[57:00] the revivals and Europe and all these
[57:01] things and then a 1906 what we had the
[57:04] Sousa Street revival yes the power God
[57:08] came now the restoration of the gifts
[57:14] everything goes from east to west
[57:17] the UN goes from east to west but not
[57:20] alone the moon follows and she follows
[57:23] everywhere he goes a man and she
[57:26] reflects his light wherever he where as
[57:28] she can I meant the very best she can
[57:32] she reflected when he's out of sight if
[57:34] she could can see she can but if he's
[57:35] out of obedience is quiet and and does
[57:38] not reach the light at her she just has
[57:40] to remain dormant but she's still the
[57:42] moon amen
[57:47] Deuteronomy 4 verse 26 he says I call
[57:52] heaven and earth to witness against you
[57:54] this day right now your testimony vs.
[58:03] the earth on judgement day how will you
[58:07] stand against the earth
[58:08] how will you be compared against the
[58:12] earth let's say you're part of the bride
[58:17] how will you speak to the earth will the
[58:19] earth be able to utter anything against
[58:21] you what if someone comes up in the
[58:24] general resurrection as a foolish virgin
[58:27] and now the earth is taken as a witness
[58:31] against it forget that
[58:32] forget the the big screen of his life
[58:35] let's just God just raises the earth up
[58:36] against that man or woman how will God
[58:40] be able to compare from the earth this
[58:42] person in Genesis 1:1 in the beginning
[58:48] God created the heaven and the earth and
[58:52] the earth was without form and void and
[58:54] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[58:56] and the Spirit of God moved upon the
[58:58] face of the waters God created the earth
[59:01] of all the planets he picked one yes
[59:05] what is the mystery predestination how
[59:09] come we didn't pick Mars how come he
[59:10] picked Jupiter or Pluto that explanatory
[59:13] the new percent who knows what it is now
[59:15] he's but he specifically picked the
[59:19] earth a chosen vessel and a true seed of
[59:26] God was picked at the foundation of the
[59:28] world amen the true seed of God a child
[59:32] of God they was they always were a child
[59:35] all the way back then even before they
[59:38] were naturally born they were
[59:39] spiritually because God painted what the
[59:41] spirit man first back in Genesis 2 yes
[59:48] the 2nd Thessalonians 2:13 he says we
[59:51] were bound to give thanks always to
[59:52] Jesus Christ for you brother and beloved
[59:54] in the Lord because God hath from the
[59:56] beginning chosen you to salvation God
[59:59] chose the earth he chose you he's
[1:00:01] because they had to perform our work in
[1:00:03] you
[1:00:04] yeah the performer work in the earth hey
[1:00:06] man something there was a desire there's
[1:00:08] a plan there was a story they had to
[1:00:10] take place there there has to be more to
[1:00:12] testimony
[1:00:13] I mean God can use the earth just like I
[1:00:18] can me you better believe it
[1:00:22] but notice the earth was a dark
[1:00:25] condition without shape his void
[1:00:28] darkness there was no light there until
[1:00:30] Genesis 1:5 so the earth wasn't dark and
[1:00:33] the saints of God we were born in
[1:00:35] iniquity shaped and all these things
[1:00:37] come out of the womb speaking lies
[1:00:39] absolutely
[1:00:42] isaiah 40:8 40 aces and was called a
[1:00:45] transgressor from the womb a man when I
[1:00:50] was born I was already a thief I was
[1:00:52] already a liar a liar a cheater on this
[1:00:56] earth and I was just bad I was bad boy
[1:01:00] my momma thought I was cute doesn't
[1:01:02] [Laughter]
[1:01:06] every child is cute for their mama
[1:01:09] praise the Lord
[1:01:10] a man a man praise be to God
[1:01:17] now in 1st Corinthians 6:9 knowing that
[1:01:24] the unrighteous shall not inherit the
[1:01:26] kingdom of God be not deceived he says
[1:01:30] neither fornicators nor adulterers nor
[1:01:33] adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of
[1:01:36] themselves with mankind he said this
[1:01:38] time will not be in the kingdom oh my
[1:01:40] and that kingdom what is the kingdom of
[1:01:42] the Holy Ghost God set up kingdom that
[1:01:46] has naught power signs wonders and
[1:01:48] miracles that are obedient to the Word
[1:01:50] of God he says but they used to be like
[1:01:52] this correct he says nor thieves verse
[1:01:55] 10 the coaches no joggers or miles
[1:01:57] executioner's shall inherit the kingdom
[1:01:59] eases and such were some of you right
[1:02:03] here
[1:02:03] shoe hands both my legs are shaking he
[1:02:06] said that wasn't me and such were the
[1:02:11] changes come but you're washed he says
[1:02:16] but you're sanctified he's the buddy
[1:02:18] you're justified in the name of the Lord
[1:02:20] Jesus Christ by the spirit of our God
[1:02:22] by your good works by your by the way
[1:02:25] you haters have no reason by the Spirit
[1:02:27] of God and only by the Spirit of God by
[1:02:30] my spirit saith the Lord
[1:02:33] thanks back with the Spirit of God were
[1:02:36] nothing we cannot earn salvation we
[1:02:40] can't Ernie
[1:02:41] we can't merit it it takes the Spirit of
[1:02:44] God that said we were fully dependent on
[1:02:46] him it alone man so we find ourselves in
[1:02:53] a dark condition but
[1:02:54] then the light comes and says this is
[1:02:57] definitely one of my child a child will
[1:03:00] be followed by that light has that light
[1:03:02] within them already that seed that work
[1:03:08] the earth worked her over started
[1:03:10] bringing forth life on the earth but as
[1:03:14] a human is made every the Bible says
[1:03:18] every seed will bring forth of its kind
[1:03:21] the earth at this time though as a
[1:03:25] vessel had no seed in it and as we know
[1:03:31] the Word of God as we do there's two
[1:03:34] areas the Bible says that Jesus when he
[1:03:36] died he went to the heart of the earth
[1:03:44] there's also a first see that went to
[1:04:35] the heart of the earth was it was a seed
[1:04:38] of God we entered in that little place
[1:04:40] that don't come partnered in the earth
[1:04:42] the paradise and now
[1:04:48] [Music]
[1:04:52] [Applause]
[1:04:56] that's right Christian earth brother
[1:05:00] Brooks gave me his dog before he moved
[1:05:01] to Iowa he said both sigh take care of
[1:05:04] her she's a Christian dog she was she
[1:05:08] was humbled she'd submit to others
[1:05:11] she'd bow or so never called me any
[1:05:14] problems why cuz he was a Christian amen
[1:05:18] she's a preacher's dog hey man so we see
[1:05:24] the earth now as a seed within earth the
[1:05:27] first seed planted in the earth and that
[1:05:29] seed had a voice and it reached God and
[1:05:32] came down and condemned King a man the
[1:05:37] heart of the earth the Earth's heart
[1:05:40] amen now let's continue and in Genesis 3
[1:05:47] verse 14 though there's a seat of God
[1:05:51] within the earth though there's a seat
[1:05:53] of God in our vessels we find ourselves
[1:05:57] come out Genesis 3 verse 17 and unto
[1:06:01] Adam he said because I was hearken unto
[1:06:03] the voice of my wife and his agent of
[1:06:06] the tree of which I commanded thee
[1:06:07] saying thou shalt not eat him cursed is
[1:06:09] the ground for thy sakes the earth now
[1:06:13] takes on the curse not the not the seed
[1:06:17] within the earth the earth itself the
[1:06:19] body see we have this curse now with
[1:06:24] this called sin it's a disease the Bible
[1:06:26] says the love of some loathsome disease
[1:06:28] and the Bible says there's no discharge
[1:06:32] to that war what's the war you'll die
[1:06:37] because of sin in this vessel cancer
[1:06:40] we've always had cancer it's called sin
[1:06:43] it takes about 80 70 years for that
[1:06:46] thing to kick in and take lives God
[1:06:53] curses the earth and we know our flesh
[1:06:55] is cursed but don't judge the earth by
[1:06:59] the curse and don't judge yourself by
[1:07:01] it's false
[1:07:05] at the soul when I'd like a brother
[1:07:07] who's a I don't look at any faults where
[1:07:09] I said that man is a seat of God amen
[1:07:13] Christ the purchase power died for that
[1:07:17] so must be equal value correct
[1:07:20] absolutely when we ever saying against
[1:07:23] Jesus Christ in his in his dying body no
[1:07:25] we say that was the Lamb of God that was
[1:07:27] my Savior a man but when he died he gave
[1:07:31] himself for it because he was worth the
[1:07:35] same thing or more than he had the
[1:07:36] ability to buy it and he he placed he
[1:07:41] put us like this he paid with the most
[1:07:43] valuable thing he had his own his very
[1:07:45] own body god you're not gonna see Jesus
[1:07:49] Christ up in heaven in a different form
[1:07:51] a different body it'll be that exact
[1:07:53] same body hey man that's his body that's
[1:07:56] God's own flesh right there glorified
[1:07:58] body Jesus Christ amen lorry try it so
[1:08:05] we see the earth is a Christian earth
[1:08:07] but she's lost he got the curse on her
[1:08:10] so no God must now start working
[1:08:13] salvation working so based on the earth
[1:08:16] the earth has she's lost but Jesus he's
[1:08:22] got a seat of God in her absolute but
[1:08:24] she's still lost she's got a curse and
[1:08:27] with me yes yes what is the process of
[1:08:32] salvation God above the earth now sees
[1:08:37] the earth and a cursed state he says I
[1:08:40] must bring her to Redemption I've got to
[1:08:45] save the earth
[1:08:46] much like Oz correct but what does God
[1:08:50] do for salvation the very first thing
[1:08:53] God must have it's his word and and what
[1:08:59] does he do with the word God has the
[1:09:02] word of God in his mind he's thinking he
[1:09:05] dwells in the word and gasps he's
[1:09:09] dwelling there and he must send the word
[1:09:12] of God to the
[1:09:18] word of God must come to a profit first
[1:09:20] yes according to Scripture
[1:09:25] who is the first prophet on the earth
[1:09:29] there's many that prophesied but as far
[1:09:33] as specifically labeled a prophet in
[1:09:37] Jude The Book of Judas said that Enoch
[1:09:40] prophesied he said I see 10,000 Saints
[1:09:46] coming up with the Lord a lot he says
[1:09:48] foes of glory oh ma so the Word of God
[1:09:52] must come to a prophet and then I
[1:09:54] remember all 66 books in the Bible or
[1:09:57] written by what they're called their
[1:10:02] names the Book of Isaiah Moses for
[1:10:07] suppose about the five first right we
[1:10:09] believe that yes Isaiah Ezekiel Joe John
[1:10:18] James these are prophets of God and the
[1:10:21] Word of God comes to the prophet and the
[1:10:25] Prophet blasts the word out then does
[1:10:31] that bring salvation yes but what takes
[1:10:33] place next how does this work the Word
[1:10:35] of God comes from heaven hits the man of
[1:10:37] God he catches the relation for his day
[1:10:39] and then he blasts it out in Romans 10
[1:10:47] verse 13 it says for whosoever shall
[1:10:51] call upon the name of the Lord shall be
[1:10:53] saved
[1:10:55] he says then how then shall they call on
[1:10:58] him in whom they have not believed he
[1:11:01] says in how shall they believe in him
[1:11:03] who they not heard and how shall they
[1:11:07] hear without a preacher he says and how
[1:11:11] shall they preach except they be sent as
[1:11:14] it is written how beautiful are the feet
[1:11:16] of the priests of God so I'm presuming
[1:11:17] drink
[1:11:18] bring good bring glad tidings of good
[1:11:20] things so the Prophet brings the word
[1:11:24] blast it out and then what the fivefold
[1:11:26] ministry now picks up the word the rest
[1:11:30] and
[1:11:31] start blasting it as well who is the
[1:11:35] first preacher recorded in Scripture
[1:11:38] what from prophet to preacher the Bible
[1:11:42] says what that Noah was a preacher of
[1:11:44] righteousness a man boy he's a son that
[1:11:51] is fixing to happen you better get right
[1:11:53] he said in the witness of the earth
[1:11:55] become great in that day oh my
[1:11:56] absolutely Noah's day Jesus said it was
[1:12:01] a wicked time oh my but there was a
[1:12:03] preacher who caught the revelation from
[1:12:05] Enoch the Prophet the Word of God he
[1:12:07] said he started preaching the word a man
[1:12:09] and what the earth was preached for a
[1:12:12] hundred and twenty years hey the people
[1:12:16] didn't hear so well but the earth did at
[1:12:24] the end of the hundred twenty years
[1:12:26] sermon no I'm saying boys destructions
[1:12:30] coming you better make sure you're in
[1:12:32] the ark and the BIOS at the end of the
[1:12:34] hundred twenty years sermon Noah picked
[1:12:39] up his Bible for the last time said boys
[1:12:42] something fixing to comment or get in
[1:12:44] get in and yeah and getting the Christ
[1:12:46] oh my and then when he closed his book
[1:12:49] for the last time the entire humanity
[1:12:53] was not ready but the Bible said the
[1:12:57] earth brought forth gushing waters and
[1:13:01] the skies began to cry and the gushers
[1:13:18] the gushed out and she started to cry
[1:13:20] and the Bible said that the water
[1:13:23] ascended all the way above the highest
[1:13:25] mountain their repentance went all the
[1:13:27] way to the earth
[1:13:32] absolutely for sure
[1:13:35] look at now they was baptized before we
[1:13:38] ever heard about it alive
[1:13:39] the earth was light-years above us there
[1:13:43] were no higher standard walking a
[1:13:45] tighter walk with Christ absolutely she
[1:13:49] repented alright Fountains of the great
[1:13:52] deep were broken up and the windows I
[1:13:54] haven't opened we do not believe in dry
[1:13:55] our confessions the last time I come to
[1:14:22] church he was he was born he was there
[1:14:25] we were all there any man praise God oh
[1:14:30] the earth got baptized but notice
[1:14:33] directly after that baptism God says
[1:14:37] this in Genesis 9 Genesis 9 notice what
[1:14:42] he says Genesis 9 verse 13 he says I do
[1:14:45] set my bow in the cloud he says it shall
[1:14:49] be a token of a covenant between me and
[1:14:53] the earth with the earth with the earth
[1:15:04] was this one the more that's why we
[1:15:14] pushed that baptism so hard because the
[1:15:17] Bible says in acts 2 or 36 he says that
[1:15:20] same Jesus whom that Cruise riders but
[1:15:22] Lauren cries either and if ye shall
[1:15:24] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:15:26] Jesus Christ ye shall receive the gift
[1:15:30] of the Holy Ghost what a prize what
[1:15:41] baptism is the Covenant but it must be
[1:15:45] the true baptism Amen that's right
[1:15:48] praise God what is it one work of grace
[1:15:55] the earth had to wait another two
[1:15:57] thousand years until the true Lamb of
[1:16:01] God you've already justified but now
[1:16:03] seeing that blood of the Lamb of God
[1:16:06] that's why you get that Christ had to be
[1:16:09] beaten outside the camp and all these
[1:16:11] things so that blood could and when I'm
[1:16:16] glad that sanctified precious brother
[1:16:18] Lord ie Savior Jesus Christ oh my I
[1:16:21] understand what watching someone die is
[1:16:23] now but I can really relate oh my that
[1:16:26] brother is so precious right if we
[1:16:30] lightly esteemed it told me God will
[1:16:35] reject us I says that it's in that that
[1:16:38] they lightly esteemed has this message
[1:16:41] waxed fat ah
[1:16:44] he's preaching on the blood again he's
[1:16:45] preaching on this and that saints of God
[1:16:47] of lightness that blood of Jesus Christ
[1:16:55] hit the earth and completely second God
[1:17:01] ain't done with her yet and he's not
[1:17:06] done with us yet oh my it's a process
[1:17:12] sanctified by the precious blood of God
[1:17:17] not a mortal man the eternal invisible
[1:17:21] God created up his personal own body
[1:17:24] filled with his own blood and within
[1:17:26] that blood was his own life Damon God
[1:17:30] Himself not a son a separate son he's on
[1:17:35] body the son yeah why they called the
[1:17:39] son because it came in the likeness of a
[1:17:40] son amen yes after the salvation what
[1:17:46] starts following the Bible
[1:17:48] these signs shall follow them that
[1:17:51] believe in Luke 21 verse 10 it says and
[1:17:55] he said in the nation shall rise against
[1:17:57] nation Kingdom against Kingdom and great
[1:17:59] earthquakes shall be given and diverse
[1:18:01] places and famines and pestilence
[1:18:03] fearful sights and great signs shall be
[1:18:06] from heaven the earth has signs as well
[1:18:09] given when she quakes when it's tornado
[1:18:12] these are signs of the earth come on
[1:18:14] these signs are following her testimony
[1:18:17] praise the Lord
[1:18:17] and what Satan knows as surely that the
[1:18:21] original Church Pentecost with the true
[1:18:24] power of God March 16 in action is the
[1:18:28] true church - Jesus claims to be his own
[1:18:31] or else false he says all else is false
[1:18:34] it has to be and a true born-again
[1:18:38] believer will what have signs and
[1:18:40] wonders following he says that is that
[1:18:44] is it right there there is no other
[1:18:46] that's the original
[1:18:47] it must match the end in Romans 5 verse
[1:18:55] 3 he says not only so but we shall glory
[1:18:59] in tribulations also knowing that
[1:19:03] tribulation worketh patience to mine so
[1:19:06] after someone say they'll have
[1:19:07] tribulations and trials and fiery darts
[1:19:10] shot at him Satan the hound - he'll be
[1:19:12] right on in the earth after he/she
[1:19:16] sanctified has signs wonders and
[1:19:18] miracles following her and also she goes
[1:19:21] into a Great Tribulation the earth does
[1:19:24] as well absolutely but after the fire
[1:19:30] except relations and trials the earth
[1:19:32] goes - in revelations 19 the Bible says
[1:19:37] that Christ the Messiah comes down now
[1:19:40] with his bride and he burns the earth
[1:19:42] and gives her the baptism of the Holy
[1:19:44] Ghost it's an absolute perfect type if
[1:19:49] someone was without the Holy Ghost how
[1:19:51] can they stand against the earth will
[1:19:54] say I Oh bad sign if I owe her something
[1:19:58] God
[1:20:23] hey that's the same see bird has
[1:20:34] absolutely no power in William Lane
[1:20:38] after the birth receiver baptism by fire
[1:20:41] baptism and here I find myself giving
[1:20:46] veto prophesy Jesus is coming on people
[1:20:51] he says that Satan will not know what
[1:20:54] [Music]
[1:20:57] [Applause]
[1:21:17] he's the Lord all right amen
[1:21:21] the Millennium the God ain't done with
[1:21:25] her yet the baptism of the fire going on
[1:21:29] earth feeling pretty good God has now
[1:21:32] taken over her kingdom and the ap2 the
[1:21:35] angels the saints of God now are ruling
[1:21:38] and reigning over over her vessel come I
[1:21:40] remember she still is cursed your still
[1:21:46] has that curse but she's still got the
[1:21:48] coven as well and that covenant
[1:21:51] guarantees another thing yeah
[1:21:58] yes Lord in Revelations 21 what's next
[1:22:05] for the Holy Ghost filled Christian
[1:22:07] what's next in line well our next
[1:22:11] promise we've been saying with a bear
[1:22:14] tie
[1:22:15] we've got the Holy Ghost revelation 21:1
[1:22:20] and I saw the new heaven and the new
[1:22:25] earth for the first heaven and the first
[1:22:27] Earth were passed away and there was no
[1:22:30] more sea the earth gets a body change
[1:22:36] yeah absolutely the earth gets a body
[1:22:41] change all the generations all of them
[1:22:47] hello all the cities are taken out of
[1:22:49] the earth and burning fire and now she
[1:22:51] gets a body changed
[1:23:04] just to the true believers the glorified
[1:23:08] body in the millennia what will get our
[1:23:11] new bodies will build go plant whatever
[1:23:13] you're tired we want to sweep things
[1:23:16] we'll never get sick again
[1:23:20] little thing in here to makes us weep
[1:23:22] and cry feelings will never get hurt
[1:23:25] again everything's gonna be all right
[1:23:31] [Applause]
[1:23:42] the earth gets a body change just as the
[1:23:48] saints of God
[1:23:57] the Lord doesn't add much from the
[1:23:59] scripture after that the rest is a
[1:24:02] mystery what is eternity like what do we
[1:24:05] do what's gonna happen when we fulfill
[1:24:08] the quote we'll speak other worlds into
[1:24:11] existence to go live on what will happen
[1:24:13] next I don't know that's all a mystery I
[1:24:16] guess the unwritten word yet to be
[1:24:18] revealed with saying to God the main
[1:24:21] thing is we have to get there we must
[1:24:23] make it if you want to stand saints of
[1:24:28] God don't let the earth will whoop you
[1:24:39] the one thing I like about this study is
[1:24:41] that it's all predestination yeah God's
[1:24:47] and look what is love it's election re
[1:25:23] around the earth I'm looking at the

[1:26:14] Lord Jesus we're believing off the
[1:26:16] innocent word God although I see the
[1:26:19] deadness of this that's the curse still
[1:26:21] remaining order you see the earth
[1:26:24] it makes her process and she makes it
[1:26:26] good we know the end we know the
[1:26:27] beginning and indeed begin in the end
