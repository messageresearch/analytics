[29:14] our Bibles here tonight
[29:15] let's get right into the Word of God
[29:16] like to go to the Book of Psalms but I'd
[29:18] like to go back to the numerology series
[29:21] here I just got a few thoughts and just
[29:24] feeling a little bit inspired here I did
[29:26] take this tonight let's go to Psalm 71
[29:28] verse 15 I'm gonna continue of course
[29:34] the purpose series there another
[29:36] revelation series and just trying to go
[29:38] day by day all the way in this holy
[29:41] Union only sweet communion that's what
[29:44] I'm trying to do
[29:44] by God's grace saying communion with the
[29:47] Holy Spirit stay in the word meditate on
[29:48] the word so we're thankful to do that by
[29:53] the grace of the Lord
[29:55] so I'm 70 115 if you're there say Amen
[29:58] all right he's got up there great now
[30:01] look at the the psalm rider here I
[30:03] didn't actually check and see this was
[30:04] David or not can anybody look and see is
[30:06] that David Psalm 71 in the Bible I
[30:08] didn't get a chance to look it up I
[30:10] would guess it would be but but the
[30:14] psalm rider says here about the numbers
[30:16] I just came across the scripture and I
[30:19] thought mine that's inspired Oh doesn't
[30:21] really say does it this home 71 doesn't
[30:23] say okay but Psalm 70 115 let's read
[30:28] this together on three one two three
[30:31] my mouth shall show forth thy
[30:34] righteousness and thy salvation all the
[30:37] day for I know not the numbers thereof
[30:41] it's so great his righteousness and
[30:43] salvation is so great
[30:45] he can't even number it God in his
[30:48] numbers Amen let's have a word of Prayer
[30:50] let's bow our heads one more time
[30:51] Heavenly Father thank you Lord that your
[30:53] salvation and righteousness is so great
[30:56] the songwriter couldn't even count it
[30:58] Ord if we tried to count all of our
[31:00] blessings and all the things you've done
[31:02] or we run out of numbers we wouldn't be
[31:04] able to do it because of all your
[31:06] greatness because of all your mercy all
[31:08] your love Lord God we think of every
[31:11] breath each breath we have as a gift
[31:13] we'd have to count each one of those
[31:15] each song we sing we have to count one
[31:17] of those Lord every good thought we'd
[31:19] have we'd have to count all those for
[31:21] every good and perfect gift is from
[31:23] above Lord God and apart from you we can
[31:26] do nothing none of us have done anything
[31:28] good except we yielded to your sweet
[31:30] presence O God so we thank you for that
[31:33] it's without number Lord God Lord of all
[31:36] the greatness Lord that you've done in
[31:38] our lives and you're continuing to do so
[31:40] we give you glory help us to see you and
[31:42] your numbers revealed that we might know
[31:44] you better in Jesus Christ's name and
[31:47] the church said Amen god bless yours
[31:49] being seated here I do have quotes here
[31:51] and a few scriptures I think
[31:55] the main number I'll be looking at
[31:56] probably as number seven again the book
[32:00] I've been reading is just so incredibly
[32:02] long I'm just I'm still in Chapter seven
[32:04] it's so long because then once I see I
[32:07] got to go look them all up you know so
[32:09] it takes a lot of time then I want to
[32:10] see what a brother band say about it and
[32:12] so it's it's good it's going really good
[32:15] part nine
[32:17] we've probably looking at numbers 3 5 7
[32:21] and 8 tonight we'll revisiting some of
[32:23] those I'm just adding to the list I'm
[32:25] hoping someday down the long line I
[32:26] could make some YouTube videos or maybe
[32:28] write a book on God's numerology for
[32:30] those people who are interested in it
[32:32] because it can tell us many things
[32:34] now most things as we said a few weeks
[32:36] ago most things with numbers apply to
[32:40] the Bible right and understanding the
[32:42] Bible for example I'm sure you don't
[32:44] walk around all day counting the number
[32:46] of times that you you know what certain
[32:48] places or did certain things and you
[32:50] probably don't do that every day or you
[32:52] know so maybe we're not seeing numbers
[32:55] like every day in our life speaking to
[32:57] us but there are times of course when
[32:59] numbers will speak to us you know and a
[33:02] simple one as I told you when I got had
[33:03] my van fixed and I didn't know I was
[33:06] under a warranty but the the number on
[33:08] the windshield they put was five five
[33:09] five you know three fives that's more
[33:12] than double grace that's triple grace
[33:14] and just saved us you know hundreds of
[33:17] dollars just because it was under
[33:19] warranty I wasn't aware of it
[33:21] brother branham you know spokes
[33:22] squirrels six times into existence and
[33:24] he said oh that's the number of a man
[33:26] and we know that's the number of
[33:27] anointed man and there's different
[33:29] things you know maybe the number of
[33:31] children that you have that might have
[33:32] speaks something now I'm not I don't
[33:34] know if we're done yet but we got seven
[33:36] I don't know if that's completion or not
[33:37] it might go over into eight a new
[33:39] beginning we'll have to pray my wife and
[33:42] our got to pray about that but you know
[33:44] you know you look at different things
[33:46] and what's interesting I was the fourth
[33:48] born child and then when I first started
[33:50] preaching brothers came up and said wow
[33:52] you have a row deliverance ministry and
[33:54] four is the number of deliverance the
[33:57] fourth man in the fire so just you know
[34:00] little interesting things like that but
[34:02] we don't run into them every day but
[34:05] there are many times though important
[34:07] times in our lives where we would see
[34:08] that
[34:08] they would have an important meaning for
[34:10] us and so hopefully you're seeing more
[34:13] of those but for me as a Bible teacher
[34:15] and a pastor I see numbers playing the
[34:18] most important part in teaching the Word
[34:20] of God and excelling explain different
[34:24] things
[34:24] of course like we do with number three
[34:27] three so important seven so important
[34:29] eight so important all these numbers are
[34:31] so important to understanding the
[34:34] message of the hour why did it have to
[34:36] be seven seals why did it have to be
[34:38] four horse riders all these numbers are
[34:41] so important why have to be three works
[34:42] of grace right all these things so it
[34:46] all works together they're God's numbers
[34:48] all work together to make himself known
[34:50] and we see it playing a major part in
[34:53] our Bible doctrine now I'm going to
[34:55] start again with my text remember David
[34:59] or the psalm writer just says how great
[35:01] the numbers are but I just heard brother
[35:04] Graham Satan I was listening to future
[35:05] home because there's a quote I was
[35:07] listening to him there and I was just
[35:08] saying how brother Graham said after the
[35:11] seven day said the seven days millennium
[35:13] I mean I remember he said that he said
[35:15] but he didn't run out of types there
[35:17] because after the millennium comes the
[35:19] eighth day which is the first day all
[35:22] over again he said it's the new day and
[35:25] he said he said someone might say well
[35:26] brother Branham you run out of numbers
[35:27] he said no eight is the day of eternity
[35:30] it's a day of new beginnings it's the
[35:33] eternal number and then he says see at
[35:35] once that eighth day hits right after
[35:37] the Millenium he said we come into the
[35:39] light throne judgment and after that he
[35:41] said we're done away with numbers
[35:42] there's no more numbers and the numbers
[35:45] he said all vanish they're all done away
[35:47] with because we all going to raise god
[35:50] so he won't need numbers necessarily we
[35:53] don't need them any more because it'll
[35:54] just be eternity amen you might be able
[35:57] to come you know we'll be able to know
[35:58] every 12 months right I'm sorry
[36:00] yeah every 12 months when there's new
[36:02] fruit on the trees right the Bible says
[36:04] that in book of revelation 20:2 every
[36:06] month there's a new fruit so every every
[36:09] month they'll be calculated I'll be
[36:10] counted but it won't be like oh oh we
[36:12] can't wait till this is over or I can't
[36:15] wait to this like we're anticipating the
[36:17] next one it won't be likely there'll be
[36:19] any anticipation or any nervousness
[36:20] it'll
[36:21] we'll be peace it'll all be joy it'll
[36:24] all be contentment because in God's
[36:26] presence is perfect contentment amen
[36:28] no doubt things will happen you know
[36:31] with months and years and and decades
[36:33] and millenniums and all these things but
[36:36] it won't be any pressure behind it amen
[36:38] because if we all be peace and joy amen
[36:41] but there won't be any need to count it
[36:44] anymore praise God because it'll all be
[36:47] finished up now let me give you a lesson
[36:49] here well let me give you the less than
[36:51] the Holy Spirit gave me this week okay
[36:54] so I'm gonna give you the lesson the
[36:55] Holy Spirit gave me so I was the first
[36:57] one to get the lesson and now you get it
[37:00] alright so this is why church we need
[37:04] the fivefold ministry today we're not
[37:07] going to just get rid of preachers and
[37:09] just play brother Branham although you
[37:11] should be playing brother Branham in
[37:12] your home I enjoyed listening to him
[37:14] today I was a sure blessing but this is
[37:16] why brother Graham said he's not the
[37:18] only preacher he said we need all the
[37:21] preachers this is why we need all the
[37:24] preachers I'm gonna give you two
[37:25] examples because brother Branham was a
[37:27] man and he said things that that needed
[37:30] corrected he's a man now most of his
[37:33] message teaching most of his Bible
[37:35] teaching I would say 99.9% is right but
[37:39] there's little things where he just made
[37:40] little mistakes he admitted it I'm gonna
[37:42] show you one of them and so that's why
[37:44] we need balance and discernment we must
[37:46] have a right balance and we must not
[37:48] make brother Branham God right but we
[37:51] must not do away with him we've got to
[37:53] have the balance right in the middle
[37:55] road we need him we need his teaching we
[37:57] need what God told him but we're not
[37:59] going to exalt him we're not going to
[38:00] get rid of him we're going to give him
[38:01] his proper place and back brother
[38:03] Brandon tells in the church age book we
[38:05] need to give the seventh age messenger
[38:07] the same honor and respect that they
[38:10] gave to John the Baptist because John
[38:11] the Baptist was a forerunner brother
[38:13] Branham was a forerunner they deserved
[38:15] the same respect
[38:16] amen but just like John the Baptist said
[38:19] I must decrease so he must the same
[38:23] thing as today but Jesus Christ is
[38:26] supposed to be increasing and and and
[38:28] our and our maybe our our affection for
[38:31] brother Branham and our
[38:33] she loved her brother Ram that's
[38:34] supposed to be decreasing any any human
[38:37] dreaming you know anything that's
[38:39] unscriptural anything that's not right
[38:41] there's not the right kind of love
[38:42] anything that's not right shouldn't be
[38:44] decreasing right and all of our level
[38:46] all of our focus should be on Jesus
[38:49] Christ the word but we don't do away
[38:51] with brother random he's still that
[38:53] seven star in the hand of Jesus he still
[38:56] hates his light glory it's still a hot
[38:59] shining bright light of the Holy Ghost
[39:02] amen so when I preach I still uses
[39:05] quotes I still use my story like last
[39:07] week remember last week when we look
[39:09] when we preach on purpose I showed you
[39:11] the purpose program said he was born for
[39:13] how many remember that that his life
[39:15] shines like a star in a dark black
[39:19] universe that's how bright his life is
[39:23] like children were listening to Billy
[39:25] Graham we just listened to five minutes
[39:26] of Billy Graham last night remember
[39:27] girls and they were saying while he's
[39:29] quite a preacher
[39:30] I said yeah brother and said he was a
[39:31] great preacher but around said he had
[39:33] justification down to a tea but too bad
[39:36] he's in precinct vacation right too bad
[39:40] he didn't preach the baptism of the Holy
[39:41] Ghost but he preached like an archangel
[39:44] boy he can really preach up salvation
[39:46] through Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is God
[39:48] he preaches all these things but it he
[39:51] only goes so far he only takes you a
[39:54] third of the way praise God amen but God
[39:57] said that's the messenger to not take us
[39:58] a third of the way not even the second
[40:01] part of the way but all the way in over
[40:03] Jordan into the Promised Land amen Billy
[40:07] Graham will bring you out of Egypt but
[40:10] we need the Holy Ghost to guide us
[40:12] through the desert the pillar of fire
[40:13] and then we need Joshua to take us into
[40:16] the Promised Land amen hallelujah thank
[40:20] you Lord remember Billy Graham started
[40:23] the year after brother Branham praise
[40:25] God
[40:25] God always sends his messenger first
[40:27] that's right now let me give you the
[40:30] lesson the Holy Spirit gave me this week
[40:32] I'm not downplaying brother Branham I'm
[40:34] not trying to nitpick brother Ram please
[40:36] get that out of your mind
[40:37] but I'm trying to help you understand
[40:39] why we need preachers today another
[40:42] reason we need it is because all five
[40:44] gifts mature the bride of Jesus Christ
[40:47] so here I just started this week oh no
[40:50] this is the one where brother bear made
[40:51] a mistake in feast of the trumpets
[40:54] brother and made a little mistake and he
[40:56] says he said I got something mixed up
[40:58] I caught it right there it's on the tape
[41:00] I'll probably hear from it and that's
[41:01] good if I make a mistake Church I want
[41:04] to hear about it brother Ram knew he'd
[41:06] hear about it if I make a mistake I like
[41:08] to hear about it so I can make sure I
[41:10] fix it the next time
[41:11] I don't want anybody believe in a wrong
[41:13] thing right then I skip down a little
[41:15] bit you said oh it's a great teaching
[41:17] there he said I didn't touch the edge of
[41:19] it but if you happen to catch that on
[41:21] your tape remember look in the Bible so
[41:24] see if brother Branham ever made a
[41:26] mistake or if you're not showing
[41:27] something where should we look we should
[41:29] look in the Bible praise God if it's
[41:32] something that the mother aunt says
[41:33] doesn't make a sense his advice to you
[41:36] and I would not be just up to it just to
[41:39] forget about it he said especially you
[41:41] preachers is what he said I must say oh
[41:44] yeah yeah especially ministers that's
[41:47] why this is important for me now you if
[41:49] you know if you're not you know called
[41:50] to study or or you're not know if you
[41:52] led to study that much you don't have to
[41:54] go look it up in the Bible but but as a
[41:56] minister I've got to I've got to make
[41:59] sure everything that he says I line it
[42:01] up with the Word of God first because
[42:03] brother Branham never took a text from
[42:05] his own sermons he always took a text
[42:07] from this holy book right here the Holy
[42:09] inspired King James Bible and the church
[42:12] said he couldn't take a text from well
[42:14] let me take a text when when I preached
[42:16] Christ the mystery of God revealed when
[42:17] I said it so eloquently now he didn't do
[42:22] that he said I like to read the Bible he
[42:25] said but man said because he said my
[42:27] words may fail but these words will
[42:29] never fail he said look in the Bible see
[42:35] some minister might pick that up and
[42:37] then you'd have it now
[42:38] now his mistake let me skip down here
[42:40] you remember which was just simple he
[42:45] said there were seven weeks from
[42:47] firstfruits
[42:48] I'm not I'm sorry he said there were
[42:51] seven seven weeks or seven Sabbath's
[42:54] from the feast of weeks till the Feast
[42:56] of Trumpets but there's not there was
[42:58] four these are months four
[43:01] 8:12 there was like 16 weeks so brother
[43:04] Graham just made a little mistake he
[43:06] said there were seven weeks from here to
[43:07] to here but as actually he meant seven
[43:09] weeks from firstfruits two weeks because
[43:11] weeks was Pentecost that was fifty right
[43:13] seven times seven is forty-nine plus one
[43:16] the day of Pentecost would be the
[43:17] fiftieth day so brother man made a
[43:19] mistake on tape and that's what he said
[43:22] he said if I if I make a mistake the
[43:24] ministers he said she'd go look the head
[43:26] up in the Bible now does everybody
[43:27] remember that I mean am i okay to go on
[43:29] they'll be okay with that
[43:30] okay he just made a mistake he said I'll
[43:33] probably hear about him the tape he said
[43:34] go look in the Bible especially
[43:37] ministers all right I'm happy to do that
[43:40] brother branham now I heard this this
[43:42] week now look I've heard people I've sat
[43:47] across and fellowship with people that
[43:49] said oh six is a bad number four is a
[43:51] bad number because of this quote but man
[43:54] said I want you to bear in mind there's
[43:55] no this is the first seal there there's
[43:57] Church and there's a bride you always
[43:59] have to make it run in threes fours is
[44:01] wrong threes three sevens tens 1224 40s
[44:06] 50s and those unbroken numbers see and
[44:08] God runs his message in not numerals of
[44:11] the Bible these numbers and you get
[44:12] something that flies off one of those
[44:13] numbers you better watch it won't come
[44:15] out next or write on the next things you
[44:17] got to bring them back here to where you
[44:18] start from
[44:19] so someone without understanding will
[44:21] read this in self for is always a bad
[44:23] number oh you were the fourth born one
[44:25] Jesse that's a bad number
[44:26] well if you remember when I preached for
[44:29] force a great number but what is Satan
[44:32] knew he impersonates it right and then
[44:35] it becomes a bad number when Satan uses
[44:37] but when God uses it it's a great number
[44:40] what brother Branham is saying here he
[44:42] says a fours wrong when you're dealing
[44:44] with threes if you're trying to teach
[44:48] something by threes and you put a four
[44:50] in there then that's when a four is
[44:52] wrong when you're trying to make a four
[44:54] into a three okay so without
[45:00] understanding I've heard people tell me
[45:01] this they've said oh six is a bad number
[45:03] four is a bad number nonsense it depends
[45:07] it's only a bad number when Satan either
[45:10] perverts it or you're trying to squeeze
[45:11] a four and make it a three and you're
[45:14] trying to cut out something in the Bible
[45:16] all right
[45:18] Oh like yeah it was like this I heard a
[45:23] preacher years ago he said instead of
[45:26] three works of grace like brother man
[45:28] said he changed it to four works of
[45:29] grace can you believe that
[45:32] four works of grace that is where force
[45:38] is wrong there's not four steps to
[45:40] redemption
[45:41] there's three steps right water blood
[45:44] spirit we could go through all those
[45:45] threes so that's where he's done
[45:48] something wrong that preacher did
[45:49] something wrong that's when a four is
[45:51] wrong does that help everybody okay now
[45:55] you've got to be very very careful
[45:56] Church because look at this two years
[46:01] earlier brother Branham was preaching
[46:03] this is when I preached Revelation
[46:04] chapter four I use this quote but Rams
[46:07] talking about the four creatures and
[46:08] brother Aaron you and I were texting
[46:09] about that remember recently he's
[46:12] talking about oh we may bring that right
[46:14] down to the gospel and bring it right
[46:15] back and placing it today just as
[46:17] perfect as it is here and remember for
[46:19] is an earthly number and see it's just a
[46:22] beautiful lesson here and so I'm pretty
[46:24] sure we won't get down to that maybe we
[46:25] will but it's so wonderful so there's
[46:30] nothing wrong with four creatures by the
[46:34] throne of God so it is for a wrong
[46:37] number
[46:37] no only when it's used the wrong way but
[46:40] he says for here is a beautiful teaching
[46:44] and the church said so one place he says
[46:50] four is wrong because he's saying you
[46:52] can't make a four into a three the next
[46:54] time he says oh there's four creatures
[46:55] it's a beautiful teaching the next time
[46:59] this is one brother Aaron was texted
[47:01] about now I'm skipping down here he's
[47:05] not about the four Gospels exactly was
[47:07] the same one talked the line the other
[47:08] was the Ox now there was four Gospels
[47:10] there it is four Gospels is the
[47:12] protection of the Holy Spirit so four
[47:15] beasts guarding the throne represents
[47:18] four Gospels guarding the book of Acts
[47:20] amen
[47:21] God didn't have three Gospels guarding
[47:23] ax he had four Gospels and that was a
[47:25] good number c4 is only wrong if you try
[47:30] to make it into something else that it's
[47:32] not or Satan perverts that for all right
[47:38] now let me give you another one church
[47:41] this is the one I heard today
[47:42] here's another lesson I've heard
[47:44] preachers and people use this all the
[47:46] time and I'm not downing them I'm just
[47:48] saying we need to sermon you and I need
[47:51] to sermon every quote from brother
[47:53] Branham we've got to take it back to the
[47:55] word I just heard this yesterday I
[47:57] thought oh this would be a good lesson
[47:58] for the church so and here's what I mean
[48:02] if somebody says something about a quote
[48:05] from brother Rama you don't understand
[48:06] it the thing to do is not get upset and
[48:09] not get prideful and translate well
[48:10] listen I know brother Han said this
[48:12] that's the wrong thing to do because you
[48:17] got a prideful spirit well I just heard
[48:19] it I studied and I know more about it
[48:20] let me hear Robo Graham said this that's
[48:23] the wrong attitude because look what he
[48:26] says here brother Ram said Christ does
[48:29] not appear from revelation 5 I'm sorry
[48:33] from revelation 6 no from liberation for
[48:37] all the way to 18 Christ is not in
[48:39] revelation 4 to 18 with the church okay
[48:43] let's read it John was caught up in the
[48:46] fourth chapter to see things which was
[48:47] is which is to come but the church
[48:49] finishes at the fourth chapter and
[48:51] Christ takes up the church and caught up
[48:53] in the air to meet him and does not
[48:55] appear again until the nineteenth
[48:57] chapter when he comes back with as king
[49:00] of kings and Lord of lords with the
[49:01] church huh
[49:03] so he says Christ and the church do not
[49:05] appear the church does not appear from
[49:09] the fourth chapter all the way to the
[49:11] nineteenth now brother Branham but
[49:13] brother Branham says later Christ
[49:15] appeared in Revelation 10 I sure hope
[49:18] that was Christ in Revelation chapter 10
[49:20] praise God because who else did gene or
[49:24] who else - brother Ram get that open
[49:25] book from who else was that mighty angel
[49:28] is that was that was that Gabriel who
[49:31] was that
[49:33] see so people take this and say no no
[49:36] Christ in the church there's no Christ
[49:37] in the church from chapter 4 all the way
[49:39] to 19 and there's just so Gog Matic
[49:42] about it which church is ok it's ok like
[49:45] people want to respect brother Branham I
[49:47] do too people want to respect their
[49:49] pastor I want to respect their pastor
[49:51] too but the attitude behind the person
[49:54] it's all about their attitude they
[49:56] become a stuffed shirt or they become
[49:58] prideful we need to be humble amen
[50:01] because look at the next quote the day
[50:04] before this the day before he reads
[50:09] revelation 10 and if you notice that a
[50:12] mighty angel that's Christ
[50:16] skee because he's in the Old Testament
[50:18] was called the angel of covenant and
[50:19] he's directly coming to the Jews now for
[50:22] the churches finished see alright now
[50:26] even here he said he's coming for the
[50:27] Jews was revelation 10 for the Jews or
[50:30] was it for the bride according to
[50:33] brother branham revelation 10 7 is
[50:35] brother Branham receiving the message
[50:37] and then John the church eats the book
[50:39] and prophesized again before every
[50:41] nation people tongue and kindred Oh
[50:46] glory stay with me
[50:48] Church stay with me now we see the seven
[50:51] book of seal book is their mystery of
[50:53] redemption it's a book of redemption
[50:55] from God now all the mysteries at this
[50:56] time should be finished at the sounding
[50:58] of this messenger now here's the angel
[51:00] on earth and another mighty angel
[51:01] messenger come down see this angel as an
[51:03] earthly angel messenger but here comes
[51:05] one down from heaven a rainbow covenant
[51:08] only Christ it could be just exactly
[51:11] like it was a revelation first chapter
[51:13] standing amidst of the golden
[51:14] candlesticks with a rainbow to look upon
[51:16] as Jasper and sardius stone who is that
[51:21] that's Christ but he said Christ in the
[51:24] church don't appear from till the
[51:26] nineteenth chapter but here we have
[51:28] Christ in the church in Revelation
[51:30] chapter 10 now what should we do it now
[51:34] listen if you don't understand it yeah
[51:35] just put it on the shelf but don't get
[51:38] mad we shouldn't get mad and try to
[51:39] start a fight with somebody and try to
[51:41] make them look like they don't know what
[51:43] they're talking about just because we
[51:44] heard one quote and we think we know it
[51:46] all
[51:47] let's ask God to give us balance and
[51:49] discernment to make sure we understand
[51:51] what we believe in revelation 6 God is
[51:56] dealing with the church right the
[51:58] Antichrist is riding on four horses
[52:01] right he's riding on four horses
[52:03] who's he battling he's battling the
[52:06] church so God has to send a line
[52:08] anointing on the church so chapter six
[52:12] deals with the church is everybody with
[52:14] me he's a man if you're with me alright
[52:18] so the church is in Revelation chapter
[52:20] six the church is also in Revelation
[52:23] chapter 10 but if you take this quote
[52:25] too far but you don't see Christ in the
[52:28] church doesn't appear to the nineteenth
[52:30] chapter oh my to see wheat what do we
[52:35] need we need discernment and we need
[52:36] balance in the script in the quotes
[52:38] right that's what we need we need
[52:40] balance in the scripture when you
[52:41] balance in the quote all right all right
[52:46] now that's that that's the last I just
[52:47] want to give you a short lesson there
[52:49] all right hopefully everybody got the
[52:52] lesson now you have to take every quote
[52:54] oh four is the wrong number bro Jes
[52:57] oh six is an awful bad number well you
[52:59] got to balance that out you've got to go
[53:02] back to the word you've got to go you
[53:04] got to find other quotes why no brother
[53:09] answer this and I know that and I
[53:10] believe that let's just be sweet about
[53:12] it praise God
[53:13] let's just keep searching let's keep
[53:15] searching okay
[53:20] now we'll go threes five seven and I
[53:22] think we'll close with eight here give
[53:24] me about half an hour more I want to
[53:25] preach about 45 minutes two nights so
[53:29] three means life and what else - brother
[53:33] MC Oh divine perfection yeah now there's
[53:35] three appearances of angels before the
[53:37] life of Jesus on earth so God was
[53:41] testifying with angels here about
[53:44] Jesus's life it was a perfect it was
[53:46] divine perfect witness from angels that
[53:49] Jesus Christ was coming to Zacharias an
[53:51] angel appeared to Mary and then to
[53:54] Joseph before Jesus Christ came amen now
[53:58] I'm skipping right
[53:59] to five now five means grace or favor
[54:02] five can mean laboring grace and five
[54:06] can mean redemption now hi this was new
[54:12] to me I found this in the book there's
[54:14] five steps in Jesus humiliation to
[54:17] accept the death of the Cross and taste
[54:20] death for every man he had to go through
[54:23] five steps so we had to labor in God's
[54:26] grace for five steps but we see Jesus
[54:28] who has made a little lower than the
[54:30] Angels for the suffering of death
[54:32] crowned with glory and honor that he by
[54:34] the grace of God there's the grace labor
[54:36] and grace how is he gonna taste death by
[54:39] God's grace amen how are you gonna
[54:42] overcome Satan by the grace of God amen
[54:44] how are you gonna face death if God
[54:47] terry's and you die and we have to go to
[54:49] your funeral how are we gonna face it by
[54:51] the grace of God amen because Jesus
[54:54] tasted death by God's grace hallelujah
[55:00] amen
[55:01] so if we're going through a hard time
[55:03] right now what do we say Jesus give me
[55:05] grace give me your unmerited favor give
[55:08] me your favor so I can labor through
[55:11] this difficult time I can't do it alone
[55:15] Lord I'm being honest I need you Jesus
[55:18] give me labor and grace because Jesus
[55:22] Christ only took death by grace now
[55:28] here's the five steps the first step and
[55:31] now you and I can copy this can't we
[55:34] glory Laurie what's the first step Jesus
[55:37] did he made himself of no reputation you
[55:40] meant when Jesus said that in John Jesus
[55:42] said I don't want any man to testify me
[55:44] because I don't need to testimony of men
[55:46] hey then he said it's my father that
[55:49] testifies of me he does the works in my
[55:52] life amen
[55:53] praise God that's what Jesus said I'm
[55:57] not giving myself any reputation his
[56:00] first 30 years
[56:01] he didn't make himself of any reputation
[56:02] right but then after the Holy Ghost came
[56:05] on him the Bible said the Holy Ghost
[56:07] came on it and it led him out in the
[56:09] wilderness praise God and then he in the
[56:11] Bible said he came in the power
[56:12] or the Holy Spirit back into Nazareth
[56:15] and he started doing miracles he turned
[56:17] water to wine praise God he was a fully
[56:22] the fullness of God was anointing him
[56:25] but he made himself of no reputation
[56:29] that's what we need to do we need to not
[56:31] brag on ourselves we need to brag on
[56:32] Jesus but we need to brag on Jesus
[56:35] though we need to do that brag on Jesus
[56:39] we have no reputation but God is a
[56:42] reputation in us number two how do you
[56:46] make yourself a no reputation don't make
[56:47] yourself big take upon in the form of a
[56:50] servant become a servant find a way to
[56:54] serve that's what we're gonna be looking
[56:56] at with the purpose series brother man
[56:59] says this like a hundred times
[57:00] he says the flower serves its purpose
[57:03] serves serves a flower serves other
[57:07] people you ladies like getting flowers
[57:10] brothers do you like advice when you
[57:15] hand flowers to a sister a woman or some
[57:19] men
[57:21] it's a purpose Oh Oh smells so fresh it
[57:26] reminds me of springtime because I hate
[57:28] winter it's serving the flower is doing
[57:34] something for you
[57:35] the flower is not doing something for
[57:37] herself look how beautiful I am it's
[57:39] doing something for you and then you try
[57:43] to do something just for yourself you
[57:44] put it in water keep it as looking good
[57:46] as long as you can that's for you
[57:49] it's serving you amen
[57:53] and church that's what you're supposed
[57:55] to do that's what I'm supposed to do
[57:56] when you come to church you're supposed
[57:58] to be here to serve somebody else amen
[58:03] serve your purpose jesus said the Son of
[58:08] man did not come to be served but to
[58:12] serve others amen hallelujah you have a
[58:15] purpose and it's to serve most of us is
[58:19] to serve our families right how many
[58:21] would say amen to that most people it's
[58:24] your calling in life I think of these
[58:25] mothers and grandmothers
[58:26] most of you your calling in life is to
[58:29] serve your family that's what God called
[58:31] you to do
[58:32] amen so do it the best you can
[58:34] hallelujah be the best servant be the
[58:37] most kind loving servant you can
[58:39] possibly be because that's your purpose
[58:41] in life is the serving it
[58:43] hallelujah because you are here to serve
[58:47] a purpose
[58:49] that's what Christ lived by he wasn't
[58:52] here to build his own house although we
[58:54] have to have houses you know he was
[58:56] called through three and a half years
[58:57] and he knew it he knew his time was
[58:58] short
[58:58] so he said foxes have holes birds have
[59:00] nests but the Son of Man doesn't have a
[59:02] mortgage he doesn't have a roof over his
[59:04] head that's right so he says I open any
[59:09] reputation from any man I'm not bragging
[59:11] on myself jesus said the works that I do
[59:13] he said the father does them
[59:15] he said the son can do nothing of
[59:17] himself but that's what he sees the
[59:18] father do that doeth the son likewise
[59:21] how many how many remember that
[59:22] Scripture he said the father that
[59:26] dwelleth in me he drew the works he does
[59:28] the works and then he became a servant
[59:30] I'm here to serve I'm not here to be
[59:32] served well nobody did anything nice for
[59:34] my birthday
[59:35] nobody gave me a Christmas present or no
[59:37] one gave me a fourth of July whatever
[59:41] nobody gave me this don't wait that's
[59:43] okay if nobody gives us anything that's
[59:46] okay because God's already given us his
[59:48] love God's already given us eternal life
[59:51] and we're here to serve others amen and
[59:54] part of it too so the part reason people
[59:58] don't get things back many times is
[59:59] because they don't give the Bible says
[1:00:01] give and it shall be given unto you
[1:00:03] right
[1:00:05] I've seen people complain about oh they
[1:00:08] had a party for this person but then a
[1:00:09] party for that person now not in our
[1:00:11] church but other churches or that they
[1:00:13] did this for that they did that for that
[1:00:14] what about this person and those people
[1:00:16] that are complaining they're usually the
[1:00:18] ones that are living in sin because
[1:00:20] contention comes by pride right and then
[1:00:26] those people are some of the stiffest
[1:00:27] artiest people that won't share they
[1:00:30] they're not givers but the Bible says if
[1:00:33] you give it'll be given to you praise
[1:00:36] God
[1:00:38] don't give yourself a reputation don't
[1:00:40] brag on yourself brag on Jesus become a
[1:00:43] servant serve serve the church serve the
[1:00:46] Saints in that are here and then 3 he
[1:00:50] was made in the likeness of men so we
[1:00:52] know he left his theophany right Jesus
[1:00:53] left his theophany that pillar of fire
[1:00:55] in heaven whatever form he was in and he
[1:00:57] come down in the form of man he come
[1:00:59] down in flesh praise God now we don't
[1:01:02] have to worry about that one we're
[1:01:03] already in the flesh that's right
[1:01:06] number 4 in the step the Bible said I'm
[1:01:09] being found in fashion as a man he
[1:01:11] humbled himself now we can all use that
[1:01:14] right church humble yourself under the
[1:01:18] mighty hand of God and he'll exalt you
[1:01:20] in due season he'll that he'll do
[1:01:23] something in your life and or he'll that
[1:01:25] all the people point at you or he'll let
[1:01:26] other people testify of what God is
[1:01:28] doing your life if you humble yourself
[1:01:30] he'll exalt you and part of the reason
[1:01:34] people don't get that - they don't get
[1:01:36] exalted is because they don't go in the
[1:01:37] prayer closet the Bible says if you go
[1:01:40] pray in secret I'll reward you openly
[1:01:42] right that's a promise like it's a
[1:01:45] promise because if you're anointed with
[1:01:47] prayers you're gonna walk out in public
[1:01:48] and you're gonna do something for God's
[1:01:50] glory and then you're gonna be a city on
[1:01:51] a hill that can't be hidden Amen how
[1:01:54] didn't you praise God and people are
[1:01:56] going to listen to you they're gonna
[1:01:57] listen to you they're gonna want to sit
[1:01:58] with you and watch videos about Jesus
[1:02:00] right they don't want to come to your
[1:02:02] church when they meet you right like
[1:02:05] Tanya amen and did you hear testimony
[1:02:07] did you hear her testimony she was
[1:02:09] crying and rejoicing on New Year's Eve
[1:02:11] and she said this is the first year
[1:02:12] she's ever started the year off right
[1:02:14] and with a home church and I thought
[1:02:17] look at Connie's purpose in the church
[1:02:20] she God set her - Connie
[1:02:22] gets her information for our church and
[1:02:24] now for the first time how do we don't
[1:02:26] know how old Anya's is probably I do not
[1:02:28] to ask right because we don't ask people
[1:02:30] especially women but think about that
[1:02:33] and all the years of her life this is
[1:02:35] the first year she started the year
[1:02:37] right with God
[1:02:38] and with a home church all because our
[1:02:43] sister served her purpose
[1:02:45] praise the Lord wasn't afraid to mention
[1:02:48] the church by deterring church
[1:02:51] patient loving kind sweet shouldn't say
[1:02:55] get out of my face you cut your hair
[1:02:58] right didn't say that we just have to
[1:03:03] serve our purpose
[1:03:05] and we have to humble ourselves humble
[1:03:08] or nothing who are we
[1:03:10] God used me let me be a glove that you
[1:03:13] put your hand in I'm just this useless
[1:03:15] glove put your hand in me amen
[1:03:18] move and me cuz I can't move myself I'll
[1:03:22] mess it up iris I can do nothing unless
[1:03:25] you move me and v v final laboring grace
[1:03:30] he became obedient I love that amen look
[1:03:33] at church obedience always follows what
[1:03:36] humility first humble yourself and say
[1:03:40] yes Lord
[1:03:41] forgive me I'm not gonna do it my way
[1:03:44] humble yourself and then obey what the
[1:03:46] word says oh it's so simple isn't a
[1:03:49] brother Lydia isn't so simple humble
[1:03:53] yourself nothing I just need to obey
[1:03:55] I've been I've been I've been
[1:03:57] disagreeing too long I should not I just
[1:03:59] should not have waited I should have
[1:04:01] just done what I what I knew the Lord
[1:04:03] wanted me to do humble yourself and then
[1:04:06] it be obedient and church that's how you
[1:04:11] be like Christ that's how you let God
[1:04:13] humiliate you that Christ might be
[1:04:16] exalted in that beautiful has anyone
[1:04:20] ever seen that in the Bible
[1:04:21] I appreciate these riders that wrote
[1:04:23] with the Holy Spirit program said they
[1:04:25] wrote by the Spirit of God he said they
[1:04:27] wrote and they glorified God I don't
[1:04:30] know yeah praise God
[1:04:31] alright next now in the same chapter
[1:04:34] Philippians 2 so I didn't know this
[1:04:36] there's five steps to his humility then
[1:04:39] there's five steps to his exaltation
[1:04:41] that's double grace to fives right grace
[1:04:45] grace thank you Jesus amen so it's God's
[1:04:49] grace that allowed to Humble himself and
[1:04:51] it's God's grace that raised him up and
[1:04:53] exalted him
[1:04:54] amen well I'm sorry to feel good here
[1:04:57] race to the heart thank you Jesus it's
[1:05:00] not a few little religious tonight
[1:05:01] they've had I didn't hear the praise God
[1:05:04] Church we need to be humbled that God
[1:05:06] can exalt us amen humble us by His grace
[1:05:10] His grace we'll do that it'll humble us
[1:05:14] make us finally obey and then he'll
[1:05:17] exalt us later
[1:05:19] so the first thing as when he got
[1:05:21] exalted he was given a name which is
[1:05:24] above every name praise God
[1:05:28] second every knee should bow in heaven
[1:05:31] Lord think about that church holy angels
[1:05:35] bow their knee to Jesus Christ
[1:05:37] hey every demon power the demon of bone
[1:05:40] cancer right the demon of depression
[1:05:43] hallelujah the demon of suicide every
[1:05:45] one of those demons bow their knee to
[1:05:47] Jesus Christ amen
[1:05:50] everything in heaven does its knee third
[1:05:53] everything in earth posits need and
[1:05:55] fourth everything under the earth they
[1:05:58] men even in Satan's Dominion hallelujah
[1:06:01] and fifth God it's so highly exalted
[1:06:05] after every knee bow after it gives in
[1:06:07] the name of a little name every tongue
[1:06:09] will confess that Jesus Christ you are
[1:06:12] Lord amen hallelujah which you should be
[1:06:17] so thankful if you can confess it right
[1:06:19] now praise God you are Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:22] your brooder your God your Elohim your
[1:06:26] Jehovah I know we must confess he's Lord
[1:06:29] Amen we must let him be the Lord of our
[1:06:32] lives five steps to humiliation and five
[1:06:37] steps to exaltation hallelujah but what
[1:06:41] I'm most when I cry about is the
[1:06:43] humiliation we need more humility praise
[1:06:46] God amen I've always prayed that maybe
[1:06:50] that's why God's keeping our church
[1:06:51] small but I've always said this or every
[1:06:53] year I always say this I say Lord just
[1:06:55] keep me little humble and keep me little
[1:06:59] in your sight because Mela Ram said the
[1:07:02] way up is down the remnant say how see
[1:07:05] how big you can be he said see how
[1:07:07] little you can become see how humble you
[1:07:10] can become and then God can use you in
[1:07:12] something great so maybe that's why but
[1:07:16] I've also asked God to grow the church
[1:07:18] so it's all in God's hands anyway I
[1:07:20] can't add one cubit to my stature
[1:07:22] neither can you
[1:07:23] so it's all in God's hands the footsteps
[1:07:26] of the righteous are ordered of the Lord
[1:07:29] all right
[1:07:30] you ever seen this the double grace I'm
[1:07:32] sure you did you probably preachers
[1:07:33] preaching on it get your Bibles let's go
[1:07:35] to Zechariah chapter 4 this is like
[1:07:43] double grace double favor now to me it
[1:07:48] looks like a double labor and grace as
[1:07:50] well praise the Lord because of who it's
[1:07:52] speaking about speaking about these
[1:07:53] labouring prophets these two witnesses
[1:07:58] alright Zechariah chapter 4 all right
[1:08:02] you got any readers out there anybody
[1:08:04] that could read for me how about how
[1:08:08] about read 1 2 for Malachi why don't you
[1:08:10] read 1 and 2 Lydia why don't you read 3
[1:08:11] and 4 Zechariah 4 1 & 2 Malachi than 3
[1:08:15] and for Lydia three and four please all
[1:08:51] right now so we see two olive trees and
[1:08:55] the midst of that is a seven golden
[1:08:58] candle stick right verse 5 then the
[1:09:00] angel that talked with me answers send
[1:09:02] to me knowest thou not what these be and
[1:09:05] I said no my lord then the answer is
[1:09:07] speaking to me saying this is the word
[1:09:09] of the Lord unto Zerubbabel remember
[1:09:12] zerubabbel was the first Jewish leader
[1:09:13] that brought that first group of Jews
[1:09:16] out of Babylon back to Jerusalem to
[1:09:19] start reestablishing worship after they
[1:09:22] all got taken captive to Babylon and
[1:09:25] Assyria in different places where they
[1:09:26] went
[1:09:27] he was the first leader this is the word
[1:09:29] Lord on the zoobel saying not by might
[1:09:31] not by
[1:09:32] power but by my spirit saith the Lord of
[1:09:34] Hosts amen
[1:09:35] so he was showing the light of God the
[1:09:39] worship of God was going to be fueled by
[1:09:41] two anointed preachers amen two anointed
[1:09:45] olive trees that because oil comes from
[1:09:48] the tree right those two anointed
[1:09:50] ministries would forgive fuel to the
[1:09:53] lamp stand to shine brightly amen
[1:09:55] right now verse seven who art thou a
[1:10:01] great mountain before his removal out
[1:10:03] shall become a plane and he shall bring
[1:10:05] forth the headstone thereof with
[1:10:07] shoutings crying grace grace unto it
[1:10:10] amen so this is enzo rubles time church
[1:10:15] can everybody see that this is endure
[1:10:17] beable his time so the headstone so this
[1:10:23] this temple was going to be finished and
[1:10:25] when the headstone would be put on of
[1:10:28] the new temple there be shoutings of
[1:10:30] grace grace double grace right now how
[1:10:37] many know that those two olive trees
[1:10:40] were a Haggai and Zechariah how many
[1:10:42] know that Israel started rebuilding the
[1:10:47] temple but then the government shut them
[1:10:49] down for sixteen years and there was no
[1:10:52] work done on the tabernacle or temple
[1:10:55] rather sixteen years and all of a sudden
[1:10:58] God raised up two olive trees anointed
[1:11:01] with the holy spirit and they were the
[1:11:04] two prophets of Israel and look what the
[1:11:06] Bible said then the prophets haggai the
[1:11:08] prophet Zechariah the son of Inno
[1:11:10] prophesied on the Jews that were in
[1:11:12] Judah and Jerusalem in the name of God
[1:11:14] of Israel even unto them
[1:11:16] then rose up zuru babul the son of
[1:11:18] shealtiel and Jess you are the son of
[1:11:21] josedech and began to build the house of
[1:11:23] God which is at Jerusalem and with them
[1:11:25] were the prophets of God helping them
[1:11:27] amen hallelujah the people could not
[1:11:31] rise up until they had anointed prophets
[1:11:33] preaching and then that anointing was so
[1:11:35] powerful it calls them to write up let's
[1:11:38] build let's get the work that's what the
[1:11:40] message of brother instead of them to
[1:11:42] you praise God you should have heard
[1:11:44] that word
[1:11:44] and should cause you to rise up and
[1:11:46] start building the people of God amen
[1:11:48] the Church of God
[1:11:50] see it's anointed preaching it's olive
[1:11:55] trees that are giving forth its olive
[1:11:57] oil that gives light to the church
[1:11:59] that's what will cause you to build when
[1:12:02] you and I truly receive the word of the
[1:12:04] Prophet amen hallelujah I've been rising
[1:12:07] up for what received it in 2001
[1:12:10] I've been rising up 18 years Ray's hot
[1:12:12] I've been up trying to do something for
[1:12:14] Jesus amen
[1:12:15] trying to preach his way or trying to
[1:12:17] point everybody I know to Jesus Christ
[1:12:19] what caused me to rise up the anointed
[1:12:21] prophet
[1:12:22] that's right Church hallelujah and I
[1:12:26] couldn't rise up out of my sins until I
[1:12:27] heard brother Branham preach hallelujah
[1:12:31] neither could they they couldn't rise up
[1:12:34] either and finish the work and see the
[1:12:36] work can only be finished when we hear
[1:12:38] the anointed preaching of the Prophet
[1:12:40] that's right to see we're not doing
[1:12:43] layers brother Graham but we got to
[1:12:44] balance out everything he said back with
[1:12:46] this Holy Bible because mother Mary said
[1:12:50] in the Brotherhood never said I'm your
[1:12:51] absolute he said this Bible he said if I
[1:12:53] died my tracks right now he said this
[1:12:55] Bible is my absolute amen
[1:12:58] glory oh sure thank God for anointed
[1:13:02] prophet
[1:13:03] it'll cause you to rise up you ever you
[1:13:05] ever feel down crowded and to be
[1:13:07] undefeated press play listen to that
[1:13:10] prophet hallelujah or you can listen to
[1:13:15] brother Jesse preach what bro Graham
[1:13:16] said that helps to write we're all
[1:13:19] working together right now I didn't stop
[1:13:23] there I just left it on their own
[1:13:24] accident that's where I stopped the last
[1:13:25] time that the humiliation see I found
[1:13:28] that in the book I think I copied that
[1:13:29] that was such a good thought one that a
[1:13:31] good thought I appreciate anointed men
[1:13:33] of God now seven let's get the seven and
[1:13:35] eight then we'll be done here I got a
[1:13:37] few more minutes I found a few more
[1:13:41] sevens and I'm still not done with this
[1:13:43] chapter this chapter is like the biggest
[1:13:44] chapter in the book chapter seven seven
[1:13:47] God just stamped seven over everything
[1:13:48] it's like God's putting his signature
[1:13:50] all over creation all over the book of
[1:13:52] Revelation the number seven is in
[1:13:53] Revelation 57 times I think like it's
[1:13:57] just all over
[1:13:58] like I'm finishing this this is my hand
[1:14:00] I'm coming I'm completing this my
[1:14:02] numbers gonna be on this god is just
[1:14:04] putting sevens all over everything
[1:14:06] amen and we got seven kids I don't know
[1:14:10] we'll see Old Testament sevens I've
[1:14:13] found some more from the old Desmond
[1:14:15] clean beasts were taken in the ark by
[1:14:17] sevens now by sixes not by fives by
[1:14:23] sevens unclean were taking the ark by
[1:14:26] twos so twos and sevens unclean twos
[1:14:32] clean sevens
[1:14:34] they even had files were taken by sevens
[1:14:38] as well so the birds were by sevens as
[1:14:41] well I can't explain that but all's I
[1:14:44] know is the clean ones were in groups of
[1:14:45] seven praise God they're complete the
[1:14:49] number of the complete be the complete
[1:14:51] beasts were clean they were clean
[1:14:55] interesting I can really can't explain
[1:14:58] it but that's what the Bible says in the
[1:15:00] Old Testament as well the day of
[1:15:01] atonement was in the seventh month so
[1:15:04] when was the time that they could be one
[1:15:06] with God all through the spiritual year
[1:15:08] what month was that the seventh that's
[1:15:12] when everything came to a complete
[1:15:14] completion right the religious year from
[1:15:18] Nissan all the way to Tishri I think I'm
[1:15:20] saying that right in the son Nissan
[1:15:22] Nissan the first month all the way to
[1:15:25] Tishri the seventh month was when it was
[1:15:29] completed and the Bible says that there
[1:15:32] in the seventh month on the tenth day of
[1:15:34] the month would be the day of atonement
[1:15:36] now there's your calendar again
[1:15:39] now remember they started their year in
[1:15:41] mid-march that was Nisan of course we
[1:15:44] started our year in January right but
[1:15:46] they started their year in March and it
[1:15:49] goes the first seven months go to middle
[1:15:53] of September there I guess the middle of
[1:15:55] October and then they start what they
[1:15:57] call their civil year from Heche shavon
[1:15:59] all the way to Adar so the seventh month
[1:16:05] was the month it was complete that was
[1:16:08] the finishing up before they get to the
[1:16:10] the regular civil year
[1:16:12] now the Feast of Trumpets was the first
[1:16:15] day of the seventh month the Day of
[1:16:17] Atonement was the tenth day of the
[1:16:19] seventh month and you probably heard
[1:16:21] preachers say right 10/7 set the tenth
[1:16:23] day the seventh month revelation ten
[1:16:25] seven who's heard that before okay
[1:16:27] I remember that okay so they're saying
[1:16:29] ten seven the tenth day of the seventh
[1:16:31] month was when total atonement came and
[1:16:33] people are saying preachers are saying
[1:16:35] no revelation ten seven that's when our
[1:16:37] atonement came when the open book came
[1:16:39] down from heaven well I can say amen to
[1:16:41] that I like that I like that that's
[1:16:43] pretty good tenth day seventh month
[1:16:45] revelation 10 seven atonement comes the
[1:16:48] open book eat the book now praise God
[1:16:50] amen feast of tabernacles all on the
[1:16:54] fifteenth day of the seventh month and
[1:16:56] that was the last feast of the year and
[1:16:59] of course that's in Leviticus 23 that's
[1:17:01] the completion so seven the seventh
[1:17:03] month the completion of the spiritual
[1:17:05] year seven months long now I didn't have
[1:17:08] time to look this up maybe next time but
[1:17:10] there are seven steps that lead up to
[1:17:11] the temple in Ezekiel twenty or forty 22
[1:17:16] and 26 so seven completion right you got
[1:17:20] to walk these seven steps so interesting
[1:17:23] I don't know if this is the Millennial
[1:17:24] temple or this is just the temple after
[1:17:27] Ezekiel or in Ezekiel's day I'm not sure
[1:17:30] so I didn't have time look that one up
[1:17:32] now but this one will help us church
[1:17:36] there are seven things that completely
[1:17:39] defile humans and jesus said they start
[1:17:44] in the heart there's seven things how
[1:17:49] many want to be clean before Jesus okay
[1:17:51] I've got to get these seven things we
[1:17:52] got to come get these complete we got to
[1:17:54] be completely cleaning of these seven
[1:17:55] things out of our hearts a manager's
[1:17:58] amen so what first gotta get evil
[1:18:02] thoughts out of there don't think
[1:18:04] anything evil that's the first thing
[1:18:06] don't think about ending someone's life
[1:18:09] right or get doing away with someone or
[1:18:11] wrath on ppl adulteries don't lust in
[1:18:15] your heart right after someone else's
[1:18:16] husband someone else's else's wife
[1:18:18] fornications that's someone that
[1:18:21] wouldn't be married don't lust after
[1:18:22] anyone who's not married don't steal
[1:18:26] always tell the truth don't lie on
[1:18:27] anybody and never blaspheme God the
[1:18:31] church said Jesus Jesus Christ said
[1:18:35] there's seven things that defile
[1:18:37] completely to foul men and women there
[1:18:40] they are
[1:18:41] may the Lord keep us pure praise God now
[1:18:48] isn't it interesting I just it just
[1:18:50] struck me I should have caught it
[1:18:51] earlier there's seven things that defile
[1:18:54] inside but there are seven things that
[1:18:57] you got to get inside the statute
[1:18:58] perfect man thank you Lord amen I've
[1:19:04] been a fool to forget that or miss that
[1:19:05] one
[1:19:06] but seeing then once you got those seven
[1:19:08] God cast it off for the baptism of the
[1:19:10] Holy Ghost I knew ya so I wonder if
[1:19:14] these connect with those seven I never
[1:19:16] thought about that like in other words
[1:19:18] in order to get faith you got gonna
[1:19:19] gotta get rid of this in order to get
[1:19:21] virtue you got to get the other one off
[1:19:22] to see if that works out maybe in that
[1:19:24] beautiful oh thank you Jesus praise God
[1:19:28] take these seven out I'll give you seven
[1:19:30] better ones
[1:19:31] I'll trade those any day of the week
[1:19:33] praise God give me those seven Jesus
[1:19:35] give me those seven attributes of a real
[1:19:37] Christian praise God all right we're
[1:19:40] almost done did you know there are seven
[1:19:42] appearances of angels during the life of
[1:19:44] Jesus there were seven before as I'm
[1:19:47] sorry three before his life and there
[1:19:49] were seven during his life which that
[1:19:52] was complete he had a complete witness
[1:19:55] from angels in seven visitations first
[1:19:58] he visited the Shepherd's when he was a
[1:20:00] baby then the angels visited Joseph to
[1:20:03] flee to Egypt and then the angel visited
[1:20:05] Joseph to return the Egypt and then the
[1:20:08] angel met Christ after his temptation
[1:20:10] the Bible said the angel strengthened
[1:20:12] him Oh church if you need strength
[1:20:14] tonight just say God send your angel to
[1:20:16] strengthen me I'm tired of being weak
[1:20:18] I'm good to go through all these

[1:20:25] me amen

[1:20:32] you resist the devil like Jesus did God
[1:20:35] is obligating to send you an angel amen
[1:20:37] because God can't
[1:20:40] expect Jesus and give Jesus something
[1:20:41] that you don't give us and then the
[1:20:46] angel is seen in Gethsemane and then
[1:20:52] there's angels at his resurrection and
[1:20:54] then there's angels at his ascension and
[1:20:56] the church said ah a complete angelic

[1:26:30] old-time religion give me that old-time

[1:26:39] around me keep me pure keep me healthy
[1:26:42] serving you Jesus amen
[1:26:44] there's nothing wrong with praying that
[1:26:46] because remember boy what about him say
[1:26:49] Church brother man said those things
[1:26:51] came upon Joe because he feared them so
[1:26:55] see it was something he should have
[1:26:56] committed to prayer
[1:26:57] rather than being scared about it and
[1:27:00] the church said I can show you the
[1:27:02] quotes in perfect faith 1963 I
[1:27:04] appreciate not long ago he said Joe
[1:27:07] allowed to come upon himself so that's
[1:27:10] why it's okay to pray Lord please don't
[1:27:12] bring me through a temptation help me to
[1:27:14] stay humble help me to stay true please
[1:27:17] keep me healthy keep my family healthy
[1:27:19] help me God to be humble help me not to
[1:27:21] fear anything amen glory couple more
[1:27:28] here now I didn't get I didn't get to do
[1:27:32] what I wanted to do on this I want to go
[1:27:33] through hours a fifty three and kind of
[1:27:35] all the different things I tried it and
[1:27:37] I told you last week I tried I tried
[1:27:39] like for an hour to go through Isaiah 53
[1:27:42] but my mind just wasn't right that
[1:27:44] morning I don't know maybe I was maybe I
[1:27:45] think enough sleep or something like
[1:27:46] that but anyways here's though the
[1:27:50] numbers you can see in the cross amen
[1:27:54] Jesus had five wounds what's five fives
[1:27:57] redemption two wounds in the
[1:28:01] hands - and his feet and a pierced side
[1:28:04] Jesus was wounded five times - tell us
[1:28:07] we had to be redeemed they are there
[1:28:12] were five Old Testament sacrifices were
[1:28:15] fulfilled on the cross how many can say
[1:28:17] amen to that there was five there's a
[1:28:19] sin offering the trespass offering the
[1:28:22] burnt offering the meat or meal offering
[1:28:25] which really didn't have any meat in it
[1:28:26] it was all grains right and the drink
[1:28:29] offering was included in there and then
[1:28:32] there's the peace offering so Jesus
[1:28:35] Christ on the cross fulfilled all five
[1:28:39] Old Testament sacrifices at one time
[1:28:41] even hallelujah praise God amen so
[1:28:46] church if you need forgiving for a sin
[1:28:47] that you did you've got blood for it if
[1:28:50] you trespassed against your brother
[1:28:52] you've got blood for it if you were to
[1:28:54] fully give yourself as a sacrifice to
[1:28:56] God you've got blood for it amen if you
[1:28:59] were to give a meat offering and give
[1:29:01] have communion with the Lord there's an
[1:29:03] offering for it and if you would have
[1:29:06] peace with God there's a way to have
[1:29:08] peace with God amen
[1:29:10] it's through the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:29:12] hallelujah the Bible said he's the
[1:29:14] once-and-for-all sacrifice he fulfilled
[1:29:17] all five on the cross I'm about done
[1:29:21] there was seven statements Jesus spoke
[1:29:25] from the cross he completely spoke
[1:29:29] everything you need to say he completed
[1:29:31] his testimony on the cross by saying
[1:29:33] seven things on the cross first thing
[1:29:36] was Father forgive them they don't know
[1:29:38] what they do
[1:29:40] verily I say to thee today thou shalt be
[1:29:42] with me in paradise that's the second
[1:29:44] thing
[1:29:44] third thing my God my God why hast thou
[1:29:47] forsaken me can you believe this Jesus
[1:29:51] spoke this to the the safe thief and
[1:29:54] then a few moments later the same thief
[1:29:57] hears him say my God my God why are you
[1:30:00] forsaken me Wow
[1:30:03] so this man saw Jesus is pure humanity
[1:30:08] right he heard the words of eternal life
[1:30:11] you'll be with me in paradise and then
[1:30:15] he hears him crying out to God feel like
[1:30:17] he's forsaken by God and then he tells
[1:30:21] John woman or his mother Mary behold thy
[1:30:23] son and John behold Your Mother
[1:30:27] then he says I thirst have him fill the
[1:30:29] Psalms they said father into thy hands I
[1:30:32] commit my spirit remember Jesus said he
[1:30:36] said you don't take my life I lay it
[1:30:37] down in other words I'm ready to give up
[1:30:41] the ghost
[1:30:42] now you and I you've heard of people -
[1:30:44] right you've heard of people that they
[1:30:46] could they didn't die they hung on
[1:30:48] because they wanted to hang on they
[1:30:49] weren't ready to go how many of ever
[1:30:50] heard of that I've had numerous friends
[1:30:52] tell me that like they've had loved ones
[1:30:56] that just wouldn't give up and then
[1:30:58] someone would just whisper and say what
[1:31:00] we prayed for you it's okay to go home
[1:31:02] and then they would die shortly after
[1:31:03] that not that we have a choice in it but
[1:31:07] see sometimes our choice has to line up
[1:31:09] with God's timing that's right but Jesus
[1:31:13] no man took his life he gave it brother
[1:31:16] Branham said this means dismiss into thy
[1:31:19] hands I dismiss my spirit amen
[1:31:22] and then the last thing he said it's
[1:31:25] finished
[1:31:27] praise God alright now I'm just doing
[1:31:31] one on this I think I think I just got
[1:31:33] one on here and this is kind of a
[1:31:35] personal one I just this is why I felt
[1:31:37] led to preach on this this week eight
[1:31:42] means eternity or the first day again I
[1:31:45] kind of mentioned this earlier the
[1:31:47] future home is like the eighth day it's
[1:31:49] the first day all over again because the
[1:31:51] millennium is the seventh day right and
[1:31:54] then the future home is the eighth day
[1:31:58] it can also mean new creation or new
[1:32:00] beginning
[1:32:02] now if how many one
[1:32:08] the Bible said be renewed be transformed
[1:32:11] in the spirit of your mind you have a
[1:32:15] choice God gives you eight choices that
[1:32:17] you can think about if you're having
[1:32:18] mind battles brothers or sisters God
[1:32:21] gives you eight choices choose any of
[1:32:22] these eight things and you can have a
[1:32:25] transformed mind he says finally
[1:32:27] brethren whatever things are true think
[1:32:29] about something that's true whatsoever
[1:32:32] things are honest whatsoever things are
[1:32:34] just whatsoever things are pure
[1:32:37] whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever
[1:32:39] things are a good report well if there
[1:32:42] be any virtue if there be any praise
[1:32:43] think on these things
[1:32:46] uh-huh thank you lord so if you want a
[1:32:50] new a new beginning if you want a fresh
[1:32:52] start in your mind meditate on things
[1:32:56] that are true why know this is true
[1:32:59] don't meditate on well I don't is this
[1:33:02] pastor a living writer is this person
[1:33:04] pure or not did this person really say
[1:33:06] this or this person really do that is
[1:33:08] this this rumor true we can't meditate
[1:33:10] on those things we got to meditate on
[1:33:12] things that are true well here's what I
[1:33:15] know I'm gonna think about this now if
[1:33:18] we did more of that right we'd have more
[1:33:21] transformed minds instead of worrying
[1:33:24] about well is this gonna happen or we
[1:33:27] should not worry but we should meditate
[1:33:29] on things that are a good report well I
[1:33:32] believe I'll get a good report next
[1:33:34] Wednesday we're believing for a good
[1:33:36] report right
[1:33:37] our sister Tanya's eyes we're believing
[1:33:40] for a good report for all the things we
[1:33:44] prayed for tonight we're believing a
[1:33:46] good report praise God
[1:33:49] think about those things how many could
[1:33:54] try to do that this week I'll think
[1:33:56] about good things brother Jess I'll try
[1:33:57] I won't try anything about anything evil
[1:33:59] I'll try think about pure things true
[1:34:01] things now last one you can spend your
[1:34:05] free time just closing with this one
[1:34:06] this is why I felt led to preach this
[1:34:09] because you know my coach was dying and
[1:34:12] there's a picture I didn't know this
[1:34:13] person was taking the picture I didn't
[1:34:15] know this they sent it to me later
[1:34:16] every time I would visit him I'd start
[1:34:19] crying and then you know I didn't know
[1:34:21] she
[1:34:21] was taking this picture I didn't say hey
[1:34:22] take a picture of me kissing the coach I
[1:34:24] didn't say that
[1:34:25] she took it and then she emailed or she
[1:34:28] sent me a text I just was so sad my
[1:34:31] coach was dying and church I didn't
[1:34:35] visit him seven times before he died
[1:34:38] not even six I didn't visit him nine
[1:34:41] times I visit him eight times now I'm
[1:34:46] not proper for saying I'm not a prophet
[1:34:49] what I'm saying is I kept watching each
[1:34:52] visit I had I would write a Facebook
[1:34:55] post each visit and I said here's my
[1:34:58] first visit I don't know how many visits
[1:35:00] I'd have I thought I'd have more visits
[1:35:03] but I visited him eight times before he
[1:35:06] died eight what is eight eternity first
[1:35:11] day again new creation new beginning now
[1:35:15] let me say this I hope that's what this
[1:35:17] means I'm not God I hope but the first
[1:35:23] three visits I think it was we'll have
[1:35:27] to look off to look later on Facebook
[1:35:29] but the first three or four visits I
[1:35:32] there were so many people around I never
[1:35:34] could ask him are you trusting in Jesus
[1:35:37] Christ for salvation there was too many
[1:35:39] people around they're all gone Pete
[1:35:40] family are they just joking they just
[1:35:41] try to the TV's on they're watching
[1:35:43] football basketball and you know
[1:35:46] whatever shows on and the Sunday not
[1:35:51] last Sunday when Troy was here but the
[1:35:53] Sunday before I got all my knees up here
[1:35:56] and I said God would you give me a
[1:35:57] chance to ask him about his soul because
[1:36:01] I've been turned down like four or five
[1:36:02] times in a row well that night after
[1:36:05] church I went to visit him and I got out
[1:36:08] my phone and I recorded my conversation
[1:36:10] with him so I'd have a witness and I put
[1:36:14] it like this I was talking like this but
[1:36:17] I prayed that morning at church I said
[1:36:18] God give me the strength to ask and I
[1:36:21] got a chance I had the phone right there
[1:36:22] I said John I say can I ask you a
[1:36:24] personal question I said are you
[1:36:27] depending on Jesus Christ for salvation
[1:36:29] he said yes I am he said I am I am now
[1:36:33] here's a man that's
[1:36:34] it's Catholic his family said he never
[1:36:37] missed a Saturday night Mass now we know
[1:36:40] Mass is wrong
[1:36:41] we know Katherine Doctrine is wrong I
[1:36:43] just showed you how the Pope is wrong
[1:36:48] but I asked him are you trusting in
[1:36:50] Jesus Christ he said yes and that of
[1:36:53] course I was so happy I started laughing
[1:36:54] you know I get when I get her happy I
[1:36:55] said oh thank you Lord I said John do
[1:36:58] you love Jesus Christ and he said yes he
[1:37:01] said I sure do in church I got it right
[1:37:06] here as soon as those words God his lips
[1:37:09] somebody walked in and started changing
[1:37:11] the subject I had just enough time as a
[1:37:15] matter I think tour two visits later he
[1:37:17] was dead we don't after this time of
[1:37:19] this last time and also I pray was God
[1:37:24] helped me to know is he saved or not
[1:37:26] help me to know and I found out the
[1:37:29] night he died I was there 90 minutes
[1:37:31] before he died 90 minutes and I found
[1:37:35] out that night he told his priest when
[1:37:37] his priest came to give him the holy
[1:37:38] water blessing which you know there's no
[1:37:41] such thing as holy water
[1:37:42] we know that the holy water is the Holy
[1:37:45] Spirit praise God but he told his priest
[1:37:48] he said he said I was so faithful what
[1:37:51] he was telling the preteen and say that
[1:37:52] but he was so faithful he read his Bible
[1:37:54] every morning and every night
[1:37:55] he said he read his Bible 25 times now
[1:37:59] how many message people do you know who
[1:38:01] read their Bible 25 times now church I
[1:38:06] heard
[1:38:07] cussed though I heard him cussed a few
[1:38:08] weeks before he died now he's you know
[1:38:10] not real bad words but he still cost and
[1:38:13] that's why I was praying God helped me
[1:38:15] to just hear this witness help me to
[1:38:17] hear this testimony that at least he's
[1:38:19] trusting in you and so 90 minutes before
[1:38:27] he died
[1:38:28] I read 2nd Timothy 4 where it says my
[1:38:31] time of my departure is at hand I fought
[1:38:34] a good fight
[1:38:34] I've run the race I finished the course
[1:38:37] and then 90 minutes later he passed away
[1:38:41] and I didn't know that I thought maybe
[1:38:43] I'd see him again but I just felt led of
[1:38:44] the Holy Spirit to say that now look
[1:38:47] what brother Adam says if a Roman
[1:38:48] Catholic if he's depending on the Roman
[1:38:50] Catholic Church which is their
[1:38:51] fundamental doctrine but if he believes
[1:38:53] that that the Catholic Church is gonna
[1:38:54] save him he's lost but if he's got faith
[1:38:57] in Jesus Christ God's Son and depending
[1:39:00] on him for salvation he saved now God is
[1:39:04] my witness I didn't remember this quote
[1:39:05] when I went to go talk to him the Holy
[1:39:08] Spirit just had me ask her who are you
[1:39:11] depending on Jesus Christ for salvation
[1:39:13] and he said yes God knows God knows my
[1:39:16] heart I did not have this court in mind
[1:39:19] in fact cam sent me this later him my
[1:39:23] brother and I see the see the Holy
[1:39:28] Spirit just inspired me to ask him uh
[1:39:30] who are you depending in Christ now if
[1:39:32] he'd have been a real Catholic he said
[1:39:34] no I'm saved by the church I don't say
[1:39:36] by the rosary
[1:39:37] he said I'm depending in Jesus Christ
[1:39:40] for my salvation he said yes I am he
[1:39:43] said I am I am alright I'll stop right
[1:39:48] there now I come here now
[1:39:55] my church that's why I went to eight I
[1:39:57] thought that is so striking eight eight
[1:40:02] why eight visits why eight not to me I'm
[1:40:06] just trusting that now now these passed
[1:40:08] on he's got a new beginning and he's got
[1:40:12] a he's got a theophany body I'm just
[1:40:14] trusting in that could I be wrong
[1:40:15] certainly but I'm not God but why did
[1:40:19] God allow me eight times to visit him
[1:40:22] and why he God answered my prayer so all
[1:40:25] those other times I couldn't have any
[1:40:26] conversations with him one on one but
[1:40:28] that one Sunday night everybody left and
[1:40:30] I had my five minutes and I didn't know
[1:40:34] it why did God allow that
[1:40:36] well I'm believing because I prayed a
[1:40:38] prayer of faith and I believe I'll see
[1:40:42] him again in good standing not bad
[1:40:45] standing that's what I'm trusting in
[1:40:51] church I'm trusting in the grace of
[1:40:52] Jesus Christ tonight now what's
[1:40:55] interesting is that at the end of his
[1:40:58] teaching career his last year was my
[1:41:02] last high school year we both went out
[1:41:06] at the same time and my brothers and I
[1:41:09] we took him out on top because we were
[1:41:11] state champions my junior year in state
[1:41:13] run or state runner-up my senior year we
[1:41:16] took him out on top he hung her around a
[1:41:18] little bit longer he worked three extra
[1:41:20] years in order to go out on top and we
[1:41:24] were the ones at the end of his career
[1:41:26] he stayed around to be with us to go out
[1:41:29] on top and now look at the end of his
[1:41:31] life I'm not saying I'm anybody special
[1:41:33] you know I'm not at the end of his life
[1:41:36] and there at the end of his career
[1:41:38] God brings me back I'm the only one
[1:41:40] close to him of all the thousands of
[1:41:42] people he's taught I am the only one
[1:41:45] there at the end of his life in church I
[1:41:48] believe it was because of this because
[1:41:50] Jesus Christ said he that confesses me
[1:41:53] before men I'll confess him before the
[1:41:55] Holy Angels glory
[1:41:59] so he could go out in salvation that's
[1:42:03] what I believe I could be wrong but why
[1:42:06] eight sister Connie y8y
[1:42:09] eight visits why would I cried pray God
[1:42:12] just give me at five minutes to talk to
[1:42:14] him then God would honor my prayer why
[1:42:22] why and I live I'm the only one of all
[1:42:27] his students he hung around for me to go
[1:42:35] out on top and God sends me at the end
[1:42:38] of his life I believe to go home and be
[1:42:41] saved was he perfect no far from it
[1:42:45] but church if we look at ourselves are
[1:42:47] we perfect all the time far from can we
[1:42:51] live a higher life of course can we live
[1:42:53] a sanctified life without custom sir sir
[1:42:57] we believe all the word do we go same we
[1:43:00] say Hail Marys and go to masses no we
[1:43:02] don't but are you saved by your works or
[1:43:06] you saved by grace I'm saved by grace
[1:43:10] that's why I love what brother Branham
[1:43:12] said they said brother Ram were all
[1:43:14] Trinitarians lost he said of course not
[1:43:16] I believe they're saved he said but it's
[1:43:20] just time now where they need to know
[1:43:22] where the truth it's time to tell them
[1:43:24] the truth
[1:43:25] that's what I've been writing Facebook
[1:43:26] post about the Trinity I've been
[1:43:28] blasting the Trinity the last 12 days on
[1:43:29] Facebook I'm get thongs up and a men's

[1:43:47] you understand I'm not saying I'm God
[1:43:49] I'm just trying to see how numbers
[1:43:52] impact my life why eight visits why not
