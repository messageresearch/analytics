praise the Lord let's go to Revelation chapter 2 this morning I'd like to continue the fight here in church hr4 this morning and it gives a lot with home life you know so we're looking at a lot of quotes about the home life this morning grace the words looking forces at that tonight more willing look at chapter 10 of Daniel you're close to finish in the Book of Daniel praise God preached and taught all the way through that so very thankful for God showing us his word finding up with the Word of God revelation 2 verse 20 praise God revelation to Revelation 2 verse 20 the scripture says notwithstanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed two idols it's just our heads of order crab I mean on your heart just make it known unto God this morning that when Father Lord we love you your God we just bow our heads to in order to use this my hands up Lord I have a great need Lord to yield to you Lord Jesus so thankful or when you come on the scene lord god I just pray Lord you're pleased with our worship and please Lord with the sacrifice of praise this morning may you Cuttino bless us with your divine presence to encourage and strengthen and correct Lord God and to Lord inspire us Lord to walk after your word with all of our hearts Souls - strength we'll take this time making yours orderly for another week to serve your lord help us not to take this life for granted Lourdes as I saw with in company or this week dear god help us never to take it for granted or help us Lord to be mindful in your presence give us wisdom that we might apply our hearts to understanding Lord God teach us to number our days the Bible said we might apply our hearts to vice versa - thus our thank you for your mercy Lord speakers now in Jesus Christ's name George said may God bless your feet see praise God let's look at this thought here this morning we learn some quotations here they're going to be blessed praise God and then once again next Sunday web carry answer just one service next Monday forward to the fellowship with the Saints by God's grace so let me get the quotes up here I hope I liked it I like to show and I know you like to see them praise God so we look at the start here on this woman Jezebel we look at this a little bit further this morning you know this topics always been a blessing to me and I guess part of that was because I preached us on Wednesday night I preached a sermon called repeal of Jezebel on a Wednesday night a few years ago and that was a night Elijah one to give his heart to Lord and he was baptized that following Sunday brother amen I believe not mistaken was the Thursday I'm not sure which side it was but this topic of Jezebel and Ahab and Elijah has always been a crucial one to me because by Babs that's repeating today you know when you pick up your pen and write remember that portion we preach on that this year and gone through that and show that that's repeating in America today but this topic in particular of course meant a lot to me because of that with ya on the Sunday I preached why we're against the nominations amen came into the message then that lens that preachers spell of Jezebel if a lot of you got baptized so because you have that ties to you so this is a wonderful topic and we never want to forget God's presence in our lives Amen man so we're thankful for that so we read our text and remember that's the fourth church age the longest church age brother Graham says you know one of the reasons was so long because the grip that the spirit of Jezebel had upon the churches you know especially the Roman Catholic and so forth she wouldn't she had that grip on there and God had to bring out a Luther you know Martin Luther which we'll get to soon but the messenger was to love a true man of God that converted almost the whole country of Scotland and here's just the reminder you know he dip it up he died about ten years before the church age actually started but his ministry flowed into that church age because it was so well grounded and established by his preaching ministry so we're still looking at the Thyatira church age tonight chart today this morning so we're in the section of the rebuke where brother Branham talks about the rebuke that Christ gave to the church we ran our Scripture and the Bible says because thou sufferest or tolerate so the false church was allowing or tolerating Jezebel to rule them but the true church was not are too bad about that we have a choice as a church this morning we have a choice who are we going to let rule the church or you like the Holy Ghost for the church or the spirit of Jezebel I think we'd all say let the Holy Ghost through the church a bed but that's the happen we got to keep all our sins out they've got to stay under the blood net dip that one step away programs that will get us off of the lead ship of the Holy Spirit in the permissive will of God and I can provide scripture taking the permissive God can prove you're actually insane mentally you say prove Amell Jeff's short Balaam bainham was given thus saith the Lord by God God said walk this way he went back and said well can I go God said fine go and the Bible said that the donkey rebuked him because the madness of the Prophet the madness you see someone has to be having mental trouble uh mental problems you know we'd say demonic influence upon their minds in order to take the permissive will of God many times we see if people will take the permissive will of God in their marriages or raising their children or they'll take some permissive will of God the church they choose or decisions other the major decisions they'll make in life they'll take the permissive will of God rather than the perfect will of God it shows that they haven't prayed through to find the mind of Christ god help us to pray through until we're sure we've got the perfect little guy if the bible said we can prove the perfect will of God that's a remedy romans chapter 12 the Bible says transform your minds by the renewing of your minds that he'd able to prove that which is the perfect will of God he had glory now brother Graham drops down to verse 23 and he says I want to give you a proof of a great truth I've been bringing to your attention all of my may have said verse 23 Jesus said I will kill her children with death and all the churches so he's talked about multiple churches now shall know that I am he which searches the reigns of the hearts I've been saying right along that there are actually two churches in every church age though the spirit speaks to both of them in each age as though they were but one here is plainly stated that there are churches and it stays just as plainly that some of those churches most evidently do not know that he is the one who searches the reigns of the hearts so there's always two churches right there's the false church and the true church and the true church knows that God is constantly searching their hearts that's why their sins go before that remember two Sundays you only preach on that we must put our sins go before us we must confess them that they go to God now and God can put them in the sea of forgetfulness that's right but man said God is going to prove to them that is so now that what churches will be those that do not know the truth of course see the false fine group because the true believers certainly know that judgment begins web at the house of God you're in a great place this morning because if you confess your sin this morning if you serve Christ this morning and so stout rice you're wrong and and believe unto a new start in life or something like that that your judgment then you're already judged and you won't be judged at the great white throne we must be judged now in this life praise God that were not judged later at the white throne judgment he says that they they've been god-fearing judge themselves that they be not judged so true believers come to the house of God allow themselves to be judged or corrected I want to reduce our put this quote up here I watch your eyes here I was going over to light again I just found this last week in a really blessing brother have said even when his mother was dying he came to church to preach and he said it's always a privilege to come to the house the Lord I have never in my life ever seen one time now regretted to come to his house looks like that Amen I thought you had a fight encourages this morning I've never seen that he's seen that either where I have a regretted to go and worship God in God's house but see the wives version the wise group knows that we must go to the house of God confess our sins and be change if not we'll be judged for not taking care of our sins not putting them under the blood the RAM said you must be sure the Holy Spirit will bring forth the holy life and if the desires in your heart if you have to force yourself constantly to try to press and do what's right at the world so hunger and in you then there is something wrong how many can same internet if you have to force yourself to do right all the time and you're not walking the spirit something's wrong because when the spirits going through you you want to do right you have to force yourself out of fear or duty or some feeling like that you do it because you love to do it the Holy Spirit in you will not hunger for the word it will hunger for God if it's hard for you to go to church and press yourself to come when the church is open there are something wrong with that spirit it's trying to keep you away from God Mari the Spirit of God will run you right straight where to the church every time the doors are open her fellowship it's a pretty easy concept if you love God God's fear will drive you to hear God's Word and then you must always say we're the kingdom of God is where the glory of God is pouring out stay where you can be spiritually fed day and night then the first thing you know if not separation comes in the home and worldliness and they get lifted up so people don't stay under the anointing immediately they'll see the effects of the evil anointing in their home life how many believe that by God's grace you believe that if you don't stay in two of the house of God your own home will be a place of sin and unbelief that's right it'll be a place of disrespect for the Holy Spirit instead of honoring and loving the Holy Spirit they'll start offending the Holy Spirit in their homes so see me muscle Rams and above all things but God in this house above everything else if you put God's house first that your house will get line as well amen now program again says this I'll kill her children with death I'm sorry this is the scripture and all the churches shall know that I am he which searches the reins and hearts I've been saying right along that there are actually two churches but the spirits folks speaks to both of them in each age as though they were but one now I want to say this all in here maybe you haven't read this lady I think you'll be blessed now why does God call these churches as churches I'm sorry these churches and churches even though there are the false fine why does God called the false fine churches the truth of the matter is that they are Christians but they are not Christians of the Spirit they're Christians of the flesh and that's something sinners backsliders remember ready to go to hell and go to church are still Christians but they're only Christians they're sitting after the flesh because they're sitting in a building that's common Church that's the only way they're a Christian they're not Christian by the spirit and they're not a Christian by the soul oh my there are only Christians by the flesh because they physically take their body to the house of God all right what a striking statement they're bearing the name of Christ in vain because mark seven seven says howbeit bang do they worship Me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men but indeed they are Christians for what else could they be a is a that is his religion no matter what he how he lives it because he subscribes in theory to what the Quran teaches in the same way a Christian is a Christian as long as he subscribes to the fact that Jesus the Son of God born of a virgin crucified and died and rose again and that he's the savior of mankind etc he's a nominal Christian alongs the church but he is not a true or spiritual believer that kind of leavers one who's been baptized in the body of Christ and is a member of him but nonetheless is in God's order that the tears grow up with the weak and they are not to be uprooted that is the command of God their day for biting and burning has come but not yet see how the binding hasn't happened yet the World Council of Churches in the Roman Catholic Church have not found together yet but they will we know that so any tear that sits in a building of our crisis preach can be called a Christian by the flesh but not according to the mine their divine is not transformed by the Word of God right and their soul is not born again they don't have a life in their soul that's right so the Spirit is speaking to this this mixed group on one hand he's praising on the other hand he's rebuking he has told what is right with the true believer now he warns what the false mind must do if it is thus and justified before God so I want to read this again I'm going to take that one quote right there one hand he's praised the other hand is Ruby the true church at Thyatira they were praised for what their works their charity their service faith and works again because their works increase as the church age went on right God prays that for all these things now the false church were rebuked for allowing the spirit of Jezebel to teach and seduce the people into living sinful lives everybody sees that by God's grace Christ will compliment he'll praise the church but then he'll also rebuke the other churches right praise the true church rebuke the false church amen now that's the building the foundation for this that woman Jezebel motivator says this now this is a great thought I hope you'll catch it here today by God's grace I preached it before I want to just review this a little bit the Apostle James showed us the course that sin takes how many other course of sin it's in James chapter one every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed and when lust hath conceived and bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death now that's a picture of exactly what is happening in the church ages so this is the course of sin it starts off with lust and then blust conceives which leads the sin which often leads to death how many two recognizing your own life I'm going to recognize it in each life he first lusted all my mom said she looked at the fruit and lusted after the fruit of adultery right she looked at lusting after that then that lust conceded to an act and then that act produced unbelief right and the unbelief and the Word of God produced death that's exactly right all nine that's exactly what we see from the scripture now now it was a picture of exactly what's happening in the church ages so this course of sin is happening all the time in the church changes as sin started nothing but a feeling so the death of the church started with a simple little notice deeds of the Nicolaitans from the deeds it went to a doctrine from a doctrine it embraced the power of the state and the introduction of paganism now in this age it travels on until it will find itself in the lake of fire for that is exactly where it's going to end up in the second death the Ritter saying that by God's grace the course of sin I'm going to show you a chart here I think it will help you by God's grace this is the course of sin there's four steps to sin as we showed right here and the example I gave was Eve first she loves it so all night that might be good and then Plus conceived it started something about started the act and then that were to sin and unbelief which produced death not only that but run around teaches that the same spirit he said work through the entire church ages well items Jesus identified the Antichrist fear during the church ages he's identifies it as a horse rider hallelujah and it wasn't just this is just my idea brother amen it was thus saith the Lord the Antichrist fear is identified as four horse riders like let's be Church and it's now saved the Lord but not only are the horse riders that sent the Lord the beasts are now say the largest would have hallelujah again exactly right so the white horse no medicine is a teaching ministry they start with deeds and then it turns into a doctrine they teach and then it turns into war against the true church which we see in churches someone will start a war Satan but relics that God won't let you stay in a honeymoon he'll inject somebody with poison he said to let them sit down to the real quietness of the fellowship and check them with poison and then try to divide the church I've never seen it happen to a church it happens every to church and it does you Satan hates every Jew Church so first thing is somebody gets us something off the word they start doing something that's not really scriptural and then they defend themselves and build a doctrine a false doctrine and then they start a war and attacking other people in the church that's also been that usually leads to a church splitting and then the program says the third thing is the money they start building their own Kingdom their own ministry their own following today is the easiest quit or data you ever get a following right a following on Instagram Facebook you get a following faster than any other day right now and you do it just as the privacy of your home with the internet and so forth but the last rider was the fail horse rider which was dead you can see the course of sitting out through the Bible it's through the entire Bible programs in Joel chapter 2 the Palmer worm is the one that comes out of the egg the caterpillar starts crawling around consuming the can't worm gets a little bigger and the adult locust flies around it consumes the whole harvest that's the four step process of sin it's our go real cute look at that baby what it is look at that little baby coming out of there oh my program said you better kill that baby Amalekite on hello church you better cue a little you see little sin your life you better kill that or it's going to grow up it's going to mature if you keep feeding that less it's going to let muscles going to concede and that's going to lead to sin it has to lead to spiritual death you better kill and crucify anything that it solves itself against the knowledge of God it's exactly right and I know if you remember this but Abraham had to defeat four kings before he had a communion with Melchizedek I'm a man in a defeat for kings and MFL Shinar there's Babylon Arioch of al-assad children a over of 11 title of Nations he defeated four kids and after the victory of the four kings and the salvation of lot the foolish virgin then he had fellowship with Melchizedek again he had communion amen and that's what we have if we can a safety score stage of said we'll have communion with the high priest Jesus Christ an end it's exactly right the lordís mourning the course of sin but also because of this program solidus and a revelation of and he preached the message the retina message restoration the bride tree and he said because Satan attacks enforce he said God will work enforce you love the Lord ahead so what is it you have the four annoying things align our ex mattifying you lioness boldness and pow the Ox is a sacrificial life for Christ the man is wisdom to know the word and the fly Eagle is prophetic revelation this is tight by Matthew Mark Luke and John guarding the book of Acts the real Church of the Living God amen and this program said in frustration sobriety tree was also seen from Luther Lesley Azusa Street and to the message that God gave brother Branham it's exactly right and we also saw in the dry bones from Ezekiel 37 if you haven't read that recently whether I post that on restoration of the bride tree in Christ the mystery of God revealed he said first the bones have to unite together then the sinew and the flesh comes on them and then the skin comes on the body but then a prophetic word of those saith the Lord amen must come upon the body and the body comes alive and see prophecy at the say the Lord and the Ministry of a prophet will give life to the people I because that prophet is screaming with thus sayeth the Lord and thus saith the Lord is a revelation and it's the revelation of God that overcomes the gates of Hell amen glory hallelujah it's exactly right see that so we need us just as Satan covers of the course of Sid God gives us the course of Holy Ghost victory it's exactly right program said member you remember the Antichrist number 4 so because Satan used for God had to use four and then he says this he said don't remember all the days you're like these beasts are correct it's not safe the Lord so just as the horse riders with us say the Lord so are the beasts that save the Lord you like that if you understand that church then you will not miss the power of the revelation of the seals it's more than symbols it's exposing how Satan tries to ten each one of us into a life of sin but it's also a beautiful victory of the power that God gives us so we can overcome all of Satan's devices and okay or if it's just a book to you assemble it we'll never conquer the gates of Hell but if it's Christ being a real you and receiving a power that flying eagle then you'll live the life of Christ you'll have Christ in your mix and you'll love Jesus Christ amen you'll be a real Christian up there what a QR hallelujah you'll be a real Christian exactly right that was review I preached on that little bit before about how to expanded does that help by God's grace you see the number four you see the power of the seven seals and all these things that's why we need it because it's Holy Ghost power amen it's flying eagle power I believe has a whole crowd of dogs you God was flying out again fire zero is found in the denunciation this prophetess Jessica and to understand exactly why he did not oopss her so we have to look up her in the history of the Bible she did back there we'll know what's going on at this time now what I'm going to do is by God's grace this morning as I've studied and prayed I just felt that to go back to the meaning of thyroid tira so if you read the church age book under fire tear of the meaning brother man tells us his dominating female so we want to look at that and then we'll jump ahead to the rebuke maybe next week Lord willing when we get there by the grace of the Lord these things ought to be more to life to us praise God more than life the Word of God hallelujah and this is where we're going to start bringing down some quotes you know for the home life because if we're not careful church we fall under we get a little lazy on God praise the Lord if we go to the lazy on Godman we lose the leadership and the the strength of the Lord that we ought to have for the joy of the Lord is your strength right and what's that first anointing that lion anointing is bogus it's straight to combat even the littlest tiniest little dieter doctrine remember the advanced stage of this if you let a little sit hang around and get greater and greater is that now you are slave to a woman right you're a slave to the Jezebel sphere or the false Church system or a slave just Satan said I try script nobody see that but it starts off or you must have the bulb of the power of the Holy Spirit to cast out any little feeling any little lust you must be able to cast that down and in order to conquer and come to the fullness of Christ that's right the dimensions most worthy to note that the married name Thyatira means dominating female thus this age is characterized by a dominant force a force that Ruth of sleep invades all everything so the spirit of Jezebel tries to invade everything so not only the church is right but the pastures but the land T that Jezebel spirit wants to get into the churches in the homes in politics how many notes and politics the Jezebel spirit conquering all right boss worship woman worship and once again in every sphere of life it's in the school system I can see that as I work in schools you can see that it invades one's control of everything submit to the woman submit to the woman submit to the woman but God say no my leadership is the right way let's accept the leadership of God through the man a man and in our case that Christ rule us a man that the Holy Ghost lead us out of it that Christ lead the whole that a man except the leadership of Christ that be strong in the Lord and lead us home like a real man of God that's exactly right see this dominating female invades everything conquers all and despotic lis controls I don't know if I said that right now the dominating female is the greatest curse in the world why is this man the world ever saw with Solomon and he said if anybody would know that it would be solid because Saladin let all his wives deceive him and took it very far away from the Lord but now we know he's saved right but by he's sure Baxter there was a back sitting King it was Solomon and here's the scripture Ecclesiastes 7:25 now we're not gonna read all this I'm skip down I find more bitter than death the woman now Simon is more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets at her hands as bands like handcuffs we threw up in the eber so there's nothing this is more bitter than death a woman that ones are controlling and bind up and control everything so be careful when people say well I'm a control person I need a lot of control I've got to have a lot of control be careful you'd want to take too much control under the church the spirit of Jezebel was to control and capture her prey in a net right her heart is a net in her heart she wants to control something in it and lock them up and and have her way instead of somebody else having their way I say let the Holy Ghost have his way man I don't want my way I was all he goes to have his way hey man and that way we'll be the word that's how I know it's his way it'll be the word Amen that's right now look the sinner shall be taken buyers to see all those people that are the domination churches there have a very hard time making it to heaven because the sinner gets to see by that woman the Bible said everyone that worships the Beast or their image will have their part of the lake of fire everyone everyone that goes along with that it's a scary things I have friends in that I'm waiting for the time of God to kind of correct them on some things but they're all excited about you know the the oneworld movements the lecherous movements that they have around America last year they had one in Washington DC in the summer it got so hot they had to cancel up midway through I believe that was God's judgment you know that's properly but anyway anyone that accepts that control of a woman at a nomination system Antichrist system the Bible says is a sinner an unbeliever they don't believe the Bible now we remember that remember this one man amongst a thousand I found but a woman amongst all those have I not found remember someone had 700 wives and 300 so he knew a thousand women he could have had one good one out all of those might have been I don't know I might have been a couple like in the Song of Solomon that first one might make a good one when we preach on that but he had a hard time finding a good woman but you know I church he surrounded himself with evil women he was partly responsible for it if so you surround yourself a trash you're going to smell my trash if you surround yourself with holiness they're going to be holy gave a head I tried he surrounded herself with sinners you're gonna look like a sinner if you're surrounding yourself with Saints are going to be separated like they are hey man right here's what the Bible said where's Ford 4 came to pass when Solomon was old his wives turned away his heart after other gods his heart was not perfect so Solomon could not go to church as he got older he could not go to church and say I've got a pure heart what a valuable thing it is to us if we can have a pure heart this morning his walk with God didn't grow closer to God he didn't fall more in love with God he got further away from God a church be honest with ourselves are we getting closer to God or falling more in love with God are we growing further if we're growing further some evil spirit has grabbed to all of our hearts in our mind we must cast that aside and we must let Christ help our hearts be pure before dried church when you say oh he was I don't wish you well that's what the Bible said about the New Testament people have so many items are not even aware of it their family becomes an item when they put the family above the word of God right and they put vehicles and finances uh entertainment sports you put all these things above the Word of God it's officially become your idol and John adds his last book and here's a hot flash but but the first book and he says keep yourselves from idols amen you believe that by God's grace keep yourself from an any Idol anything that's more important than the Lord Jesus Christ as I told you that I'll share it for lohanthony a young Anthony sorry that little young he's probably good to me but God just said he's here I didn't give my life to Lord's house 18 I was raised in a Pentecostal church with his spoken tongues all the time interpreted my mom was healed of cancer I was in second grade so she's still alive today God is a healer I know I knew God was a healer by many idols as soon as I got the car turn on my radio rock n roll music and that K that was an idol for me I always wanted a girlfriend that was the idol for me always watch sports all day Sunday and Saturday no time for God that was the idol for me I had the wrong friends I put friends above the word that was an idol for me I had so many idols that I got into drugs there were things like that but by the grace of God through the power of the Holy Spirit I've been able to take each one of those idols cast them down and stop them to dust by God's grace and take that Gossip Girl is a Brooke Kent rowdy and like a Hezekiah and Josiah did because there's power in the cross of Jesus they met there's power there and we must keep ourselves from idols you must be honest enough to say listen I've made an idol God forgive me of this I passing this out I'm destroying it and I'm getting rid of it by the grace of God remember this type it's been so many years since I preaches I don't think by the amens ever see this type I preach this it I have a one time about Rachel with her gods remember when she took the gods of Laban I preached in Iowa one time and the brother and one of the brothers walked up afterwards he said you know just listen to radio preacher yesterday and I said what are those gods of Rachel what does that type out and he said your sermon just answered my question today Rachel use the excuse of her unclean custom to hide the items remember she said Oh dad you know you got to search my tent but i'm unclean right now so just search i can't move and the whole time the idols were hiding under her they're hiding deep under her right today people do the same thing as rachel that used the excuse so I'm just a sinner and then hide their idols under that false excuse you are just a sinner in your flesh but your soul should be born again from God your soul ought to be a part of God and the church said your soul is not a part of Satan your soul is a part of God stop looking at your flesh and look at the soul of man a man Paul said it's not either sin but sin to twelve within me and see we've become a racial we become a little bit of a hiding of our sins we make excuses well rotor Jess I can't you understand I'm a sinner I struggle yes so do I but that's no excuse to hide it be honest with yourself and cast out on all idols and live pure for Christ if you fast forward before she dies Jacob takes her to the house of God what a beautiful time hitting head guard because judgment begins we're at the house of God and Jacob forces all his visiting four wives i believe about mistake one white one line for three concubines of - Aiza - cocky minds i forget how that does we had four wives and he says all of you oh my household are going to take your strange guys and we're burying them under the oak in chichén and that was a before we go to the house of God and then she was fit to be called homes in the same chapter she gives birth to Benjamin she has a second birth brings forth life a second time and then changes the mention already I like that did you see that before we come to the house of God we must bury our sins at the tree at Jesus's crossing and we must bury them at the mercy tree we must hide them in the rock of ages' anything give them the Christ like Christ put them away then go to the house of God and then no time for body change it's time for death to sell that light might be produced that's what Rachel was a beautiful type of death right up bringing forth light and then depth and then body change amen hope you can see that by God's grace once you type out your text out the bride the bride will sometimes bring idols into their lives but before they go to meet God before they go and can have a real body change all sins must be put under the mercy truth praise God it's exactly right what a beautiful type Paul said I suffer not a woman to teach or assert authority from the Garden of Eden onward women as constantly and successfully tried to take control over the man remember one even Adam of course and right today it is the woman's world with the goddess of America being a naked female as the female Idol holding out of the skies remember her arms were iron bars and emphasis so her Power has grown until she has gained absolute authority such authority being asserted by her iron disposition now watches iron disposition this is for our sisters in our church but listen it's also for our disposition to Christ brothers don't let the servant just be the home he's finally going to preach on those sisters I'm gonna preach other brothers do preach on everybody I mean we all need it raise God let's see our disposition through the husband Christ must be a submissive disposition apparently the woman is not meant to have an iron disposition in other words like standoffish I'll stand against you I'll fight against you she's not meant to have that she's a court of the scripture to be submissive to the male in other words she's like okay whatever you say okay whatever that's how you feel that that's fine that's a submissive disposition not an item disposition it's my way or the highway what are you talking about this is mine my plans in my day and all these things you know my decision a woman is supposed to have a soft disposition not a higher one because IRA types out the feet of that image Daniel saw right Babylon it types out jessabelle great right mother harder see this is commanded of the woman woman who's truly female all female will be of that submissive disposition not a doormat no real male makes a female a doormat but she will want to be under Authority and not rule over the male for is the head of the house if she breaks that image that God made for her she's perverted so when she starts taking control the house and less God I'll just rule the house if my husband won't rule the house or or maybe he's real weak like that but really laid-back or maybe he's just not there to rule it if she starts taking over its ups taking control she has to become a perverted female and the church said that's right or she's willing to fight against a strong man maybe she's got no strong husband but she's able to willing to fight against that with an island disposition I'll go toe to toe and you talk it my way oh my that's a night of disposition any male that left the woman take authority has also broken that image and he is perverted so now sisters you can say maybe someone preached on some men now beginning a mental sister that's a good any male that does it he's perverted so any man that takes the tribal realness I'm not talk about naturally I'll talk about spiritually spiritually takes the drivers fear or makes all the decisions for the family he's / murdered he has not he's now become not a man when he's come less than a man he's not a real man he's for heard of man Solomon was the example we already gave he had an imperfect wandering arm bill altars and houses for idols and that Shane would men do that they'll build an altar they'll make their home so pretty for their life and yet they don't support the church in that a shame they just don't like him they good they spent money extra buddy on this and that and not support the church like they ought to know Solomon have mercy on that person's heart he went and built and rebuilt the house of God to all these other houses and and and I know that every Green Tree the Bible said and though the city with idolatry because he just said ok honey I'll try to make you happy brothers be careful when you say ok honey I just want to make you happy be careful what you're doing and the church said be a man so it wasn't a man because they will stand up and say you know let's roll that was our real God there's only one true God and brothers should better say there's only one true God the Lord Jesus Christ so we follow all his commands in that they have that Jezebel killed most of God's prophets not all my Muslim neighbor and then he let Jezebel kill naval form so he could inherit some land the old houses and don't build houses for false gods and he let her convince him that he lied she was the problem Church brother Brennan is not the problem today and the church said man rubber bands not the problem brother branham is a great source of a solution because when he brings us God's Word it's no longer our thought or what our opinion we take God's opinion a day and so see he led Jezebel influence well he just saw Holy Roller and he said it so much that he went up and said how are you you're the one that troubles is grown he said I like I said I love the one trouble in stro you're the one trouble is now you're letting her run the show and what he just kept on the same old way God hold it one time but we know he was lost he was an awful man he was raised the right away but when I went away from God what a shame you see he let his white have too much control he let his wife do things without really praying about it or seeking God about it he wasn't a real man Ahab was a perverted man he wasn't me Church you brothers should get this this morning Aaron was another perverted man he feared John the Baptist at the beginning he feared John and the Bible said he observed John he actually listened to something John said he listened to the lives of prison in order to today he would listen a little bit to programming yet he let her odious influence her daughter to kill John the Baptist allowing the silence of Elijah and that's what happens when women will oh he preaches too hard on women honey let's not play brother Brown takes anymore shame on that man that would do that can't you Riley divide the truth can you rightly divide how other man will rebuke evil women but then praise the right woman the holy woman Cathy will see that they only focus on the rebuke rather than focus on the praise we've got to see bow but see people have that spear like Herodias I just don't like that it is so like the correction but God loves the corrected UN and God as a merciful God must warn the unruly he must warn the ungodly he's duty-bound to do that exactly right I'm not done brothers amen go I'm sorry dude hey man sorry had Abraham I'm sorry we all make mistakes forgive me Abraham became a little perverted when he left Sarah convinced him to take hey go remember that he got a little perverted he let her make the decision about marriage I'm just taking her just incurred we have this little drama on the or is it the Living Bible series and it's it's so is so inspired at first Abraham they're having like a conversation between Sarah and Abraham about a go anyway I was like no God said and Sarah kept just saying no it's already decided it's our decided it's already decided briefs today right look yes another wise and because he wanted to have a son so bad he wanted to try to bring the God's Word to pass himself God doesn't need our help to bring his word to pass God just needs a surrender submissive servant is where God help us to be submissive again not trying to inject our thoughts or make the rapture happen or make the church that better ourselves now with our efforts but our inspiration from the Holy Ghost amen exactly right what it produce much loud man right but your I allow that Ishmael's that's what it produced when you try to inject your thought into the promise of God we know that Samson was perverted for a while the light oppressed him an urge him daily if you love me you'll do this if you love me you tell me urgent daily with her words until he surrendered the secret what that looked like to us it looks like safety to say I'll just surrender the Holy Ghost meeting surrender your paradise you don't have to pray that much surrender your dedication to God's house and surrender dedication to God's Word he just whispers and just relax it and just don't be tough Ian so tiny just get laid back and just relax that's the Delilah voice of this salary that's what brother Branham said I'm not saying anything he didn't say he said that but Joe some of the Old Testament is our example of how to overcome that how you overcome that daily pressing that alien temptation say I fear God more than fear you I fear the Lord I honor love God's Word Lord I love you other than again here's our boat herb says it how can we have a Holy Ghost revival when you're so bound in stark she's talking to his home church never never feel like home churches get starchy what you think the home church never get starchy every home church is starchy right if not everybody would go to the church that never gets starchy I moved there I'm about to Yahoo there I'd sell out everything about go and there's a church and never got starchy I'd go there he said form of godliness the Bible said they have a form agafia's but deny the power thereof the power book of power organization of out-of-the-world the pilot of church the power of the Holy Ghost that's the secret place in the church the power of the Holy Ghost right and when the church adopts educated preachers and big buildings and finery in the set of the old-fashioned Holy Ghost they'd better be in the mission again amen true how're you going to have a revival the Holy Ghost and people quench it and bound it in our afraid of it there's where the trouble lies remember brother Simon precept we can't buy you the Holy Ghost when retreats out last night we can't buy it just like it relax and see how it whispering soon Oh Samson Oh Samson just started just just relax on God don't be so dedicated to God as we heard last Sunday for brother Samuel don't be so dedicated Noah don't be so dedicated that's the Lila that's just a bell listen what's the first thing that dunder Samson when they caught up a mountain they took his power way they found a secret they found your secret the world found your secret Samson the Philistines is on me now look at my back said brother he said Brandon Tabernacle world ism is creeping in among you so just as a just as Samson was hardened so brother branham Lauren's his church you're starting to get a little worldly you're starting to act like the world sound like the world dress like the world love the things the world loves he said what about it have you exposed your secret others have you give it away your prayer life and give it away the power of the Holy Spirit have you exposed the secret God gave you when you're wallowing there and the sawdust a few years ago and you let it creep up with you social formal worship see how you let churches get like a routine just come here and expect nothing to happen I know of a teacher let me cut his trunks with the name I know God gave me a teaching ministry not just saying this and I know I did a lot of teaching that's enough what that's a gift I had I can only be what God made me think but I've also got to give to Pastor and so if someone might say well we're brother Jesse you know there's teaching of the word that ends the word ngoz for two different things the word is just teaching the gospel is the power and I understand that but this is any gift of God that's given to the Holy Spirit God can use that and people can use that gift if they're into with the Holy Spirit to pull out whatever they have need up out of the gift of God I'm a teacher but last Mother's Day somebody got healed of divine healing from a teaching ministry so people can't tell me that God can't do something because I'm just a teaching pastor or what about or just a what about - you're just an evangelist or you're just this or you're just that God's gifts all have their place God's gifts are all needed it's our approach it's our attitude to God's gift that makes all the difference amen so if you feel sorry well I've got to teach and assert you don't preach as much like other men off - it don't matter God has placed you God knows exactly where you need to be first why not if you're in the will of God and here for the will God supported with all you have don't let any Amalekite creep in and give you a formal Church experience you must come to church expecting God to do if you come that way I see it over and over again I promise you gotta meet your need a man but you he's got to come not formal and don't let say in dirt the lie the Lewis away and take away our secret power of expectation our secret power of faith our secret power of time in the word and loving the Word of God instead of loving the things of the world my goodness no matter toasters what happened to you random Tiger doctors have become all formal it's all just formal there's no more supernatural Wow God can come down to perform Amerigo and go right in through the audience and tell people the secrets of their hearts and everything and heal the sick and afflicted which we've seen that here in our church and new signs and wonders and preach his word as hard as they can by the Holy Ghost some people say well I guess that's all right and we enjoy listen to it once in a while if we're not too tired brother Branham is bawling out his own church are you with me and he said I could come here and give the sermon after the sermon and you're getting formal it's not exciting to you and you're not keeping the Lord has the Apple drop Amen with me and they're letting tyre this and let it see they're not resting enough on Saturday if you're tired of a sudden that you're not resting Saturday and Friday like you off to this is available this is that they arrest spiritually but that they to feed on God's Word as well and if you're to the time was not to get some rest type it relax it's time to get some rest that's random Tabernacle the Philistines is Amon do you think he's just making this up to kind of play around and be fun think whether the Prophet just make up things to be fun if everywhere I preach two Sundays ago I said I wonder if we're coming to Kadesh Barnea judgment begins the house of God around every church comes there are you going to move into the promise of God into deeper things of God or not and here we have another one here have another challenge to the church who's going to move up into the spiritual things of God I am by God's grace we had every Asher should move up and the people can move up right program so you'll never live any higher than your pastor maghreb says that's right okay I said when it used to be the preaching of the word at Branham tabernacle and the old Saints with tears in their eyes during the preaching would rise their feet and walk sobbing maybe not saying a word just walking down two or three and set down and so fill with the Holy Ghost the word fed them now he's rebuking the random Tabernacle I used to see tears and people come to the altar at random time that co-manage another by bread alone but by every word to precede thought about the gun the Philistines is upon me random tabernacle Philistines is upon you friends now he calls out the aged Pentecostal because we're moving into now the bride age the Baptist Holy Ghost the seals are open Church ages are revealed they're moving into that it calls out the latest age what the Holy Spirit would say the Philistines is upon you right a Christ fellowship right every Church has it every Church has a que - every Church has this habit are we discharged becoming formal or is it still our hearts desire amen what about you but I know my answer I know my answer this is the one horse desire to love God the worship God and here's where he preaches word and the singing songs and the worship with you is still my heart's desire that's right let's get back to the church age book I'm going a little bit further I set a timer so when it preached too long today so let's get back to the church age book and I got a few quotes I want to close with about family life that's why a woman cannot wear that much cocaine pertaining to a man on colored hair she's never to wear garments that pertain to a male or cut her hair when she does she's indulging into the male domain taking authority and perverting herself now let's stop right there so if she's evading his what about when he invades hers he gets weak instead of being a strong leader strong man letter the Holy Spirit he gets weak what is he doing he's coming brother em call to the we don't want men in the church we want strong miniature anything we don't want dominating females we want submissive sweet female Amen right Church right and when a woman invades the pulpit which is commanded she must not do she shows what spirit she's up think adopt many females Antichrist and the season the Roman Catholic Church are in here though she may deny this ever so vehemently but when it comes to the word that God's Word be true in every man's word alive let's go back to the getting and the original physical creation as we know it today God made everything in pairs man female there were two chickens rooster head there were two cattle the Cotton Bowl and right down the line and when it came to man there was only one they were not a pair Adam had been made in the image of God he was a son as the son of God he would not be tempted and Paul that would be impossible so God took a byproduct a man that caused the fall woman never stepped fresh out of the hand of God as a true product of God see she wasn't created individually she was created codependent Lee right it depended upon Adam that's how she was created and that's a real woman today that's a real church she's depending upon Christ Aidan Annie she was produced from man and when God calls her to be brought forth from man she was vastly different from the other females he had created she was able to be seduced no other female creation can be immoral but the fee human female may be touched at almost any time and that weakness is in her allowed Satan to seduce her by the way the serpent and has brought the woman to very peculiar position before God his word the side to supply this to all the sisters now this apply to the church she's the type of all things both her vile and loathsome on one hand on the other hand she the type of all things clean and beautiful and holy as the reciprocal of the Spirit and the blessings of God hey so see how these contrast these two churches once dominating in is the is the is the type of all things evil and one submissive to God as a of all these pure on one hand she's Koga who's drunk with the light of her fornication on the other hand she's called the Bride of Christ on one hand she's called Mystery Babylon the abomination before God on the other hand she's called the New Jerusalem our mother on one hand she's so far wicked and lewd that she is summer summer summer summer league I can't say that sorry Casa de they can fire as the only pit place for her on the other hand she's exalted to heaven sharing the very throne of God as the only place retaining such a queen now what our research what's hard is this this position of crisis morning are we hard towards the Holy Spirit are we being submissive and Lord I'll do whatever you call me to do if you ask me to step up idle aside I'll gladly do that if you ask me to cast this out if you ask me to end a relationship or a friendship or you asking you to do this or that I'll be happy to do it lord I won't hold on to anything I won't hide under any excuse for office I'm just unclean I'm I'm just a sinner saved by grace I'm just a foolish virgin don't hide under unclean let it be exposed and let God have his way man exactly right hey glory I'm almost finished with this part and in this dire team of church age she's the dominating female she's Mystery Babylon she's the great she had just felled the false prophet is why because the true female is submissive to God Christ is her head she has no word when his no thought fit is no leadership in his but what about this church she's cast out the word what destroyed the Bibles and worthy essays of the godly just slaying those who had reached the truth she's taking over Kings princes and nations controls armies and City as soon as the true body of Christ and that her hopes are the best she's entirely seduced by the devil until she in turn has become the seducer of others that's when you know someone's really deep in Antichrist spirit not only are they - see now they're trying to deceive other people and we've seen a recently people that leave the message therefore the message and turn around in a few months and now they're trying to deceive people out of the message that's what you know the Antichrist fear has really taken effect you become the seducer others instead of the instead of the the freer of others you become the seducer the enslaved or mothers see that we must be like Christ and set the captives free hey she's the bride of Satan and has produced his bachelor child religions now I'm going to let's see one two three four okay I'm gonna skip this let's move on a little bit I'm going to try to close with a few thoughts here I want to just pop a few I think it's so healthy family life is there's a need for it I just you know as I've said yesterday these just came to me that's how you go I'm just trying to find leadership with the Holy Spirit and I hope these will help you by God's grace questions answers 1964 I found some husband and wife questions I think that might be help to you to show the submission of a woman to the man but also the way a man should lead his wife I thought just by the leadership of the Holy Spirit I thought that would be helpful to this small person these first few questions there are husbands that are sinners and they're forbidding their wives to read the Bible go to church and dress folding remember she's submissive right to her husband brother branham the Bible tells us a wife should obey her husband I have a Christian of my husband as a sinner he persecutes me in every way that he can and for me not to go to church and read my Bible and denies the word what should I do oh man says what should you do you're supposed to bear husband that's the word now if he tells you and refuse you to read the Bible go to church you don't have to obey that because either will forsake his father mother husband whatever it is and follow me is not worthy to me praise the Lord pretty simple right if someone tells you you can't read your pray or dress the right way you have a right to disobey them as a woman as a married woman and obey God I've heard people say that on YouTube I want to get the comments they say oh but my husband was going to wear this as a booty level Chrysler doesn't it's pretty easy question I said hate to say that I got your husband but somebody's got to tell you right it's either going to be me or I can tell you this book in this book and Tyga is one of the other I think I'll just tell you right now see that he goes in to say no the man or a man is not supposed to use that authority of a woman just because he's her ruler so see a Reno man will not lead up a woman outside the word only to the word Amen that's right God is her ruler above you brother see if your wife is doing something wrong then you got a right to tell her and she's supposed to listen to you but you haven't gotten a right to beat her dragged her around her do things I know people in this message that let their husband beat them and people tell them you have to leave you have to leave it like no I got to submit I got to submit like that and that's not right the Bible said if a woman is pleased as well she's fine but if she has to leave she can leave but she can't marry again right like I said brothers it if a woman cuts her hair a man can put her away now real man would try to love her and forget were not divorced it right and trying to pray her through back to God but if he wanted to he could because she dishonored her head which also does her husband which also decided as Christ which dishonor Scott the invisible spirit that's right right from the Bible but he can't marry again for that either that's Scripture as well he can't how many believe the Word of God that's right church that's right any man that I meet a woman isn't even a man he's a right not real way you see God in a man help me not a doormat remember she was your sweetheart she should always do that amen keep the honeymoon alive hey I remember sister bones posted three weeks ago god bless Fagor keeping a hug you live brother I like I'm trying to say by God's grace other there yet here's a second question also brother branham I believe a woman should be subject to her husband but if a Christian woman has a sinner husband who's not even to one of your services come to one your service what one is white to be doing things cut their hair wearing shorts and go to ungodly places is the woman's supposed to be subbed to this man in this way please explain this more clearly as this question is a question often asked so this was asked often what if my husband tells me to deny the word the RAM gives the same answer no sister you're not subject to such a person no need because you'll leave everything in cleave to God if if that man wants to live with you at state a Christian and you stay a Christian but if he's going to make you wear shorts cut your hair and do all these other things and ungodly places you seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness you're not valid as such a person as that amen that's what Paul meant when he said you're not bound to someone like that that doesn't mean you're loose from the bond the vow you're still bound to that person but you're not physically bound to live with that person if they persecute you that's exactly right now I'm not enough preaching for women and men to leave each other either I'm saying when it comes down to headship we must follow the leadership of the Holy Ghost that's what I'm saying and seek godly leadership before you make any big decision seek the leadership pray in fast seek God for that's right but the Bible says as long as you're pleased its well with together remember that first we need seven I didn't put these scriptures out and cause because I just picked them up a few minutes ago but Paul said as long as the unbelieving husband as unbelieving wife or so forth let the believing why to remain with unbelieving husband as long as it's not rained out to God if he's pleased to go with her go ahead honey if you want to go to church that's alright but I ain't going I don't believe in it don't need nothing new that when you go ahead that's alright but when he says you can't do it now there is a different thing you're not founded that then you separate everything for God see whether man gives them a permission to women if there is if someone if your husband is keeping you from obeying the Word of God your right to go but you cannot marry yet so see we're looking at submission we're looking at we don't want to iron the women go in iron this position and the bride the church we don't want to iron this position of the word submissive disposition but in that case if your human husband is telling you do things outside the word you've got to have the submission to the Holy Spirit to that right that's right here's how this question when the husband wants wife to attend denominational Church of type and we have this in our church and I think this is the sister does a great job no balancing this program I have accepted God's message of today and also our son we both have been baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ my husband hasn't accepted the message and despite this message he's influenced our son is taken to a Methodist Church he wants me to go with him to church when we are not in service here the tabernacle you see sometimes it would come she would grade her son the tabernacle but he but she said whether or not in the tabernacle service my husband wants me to go to the nomination church would be right for me to go with him or be better to stay on that denomination look at now remember that did the Bible say come out of her my people you see that the Bible says come out of her my people but no some of this brother and says go ahead and go just don't partake of their false doctrine see because why in her heart she's already come out of it I live it up in her soul she's already come out because she don't go along denominational trash she knows no row with Creed's Abed you don't go around with Antichrist spirit she's got the Spirit of Christ in her she knows the truth of God so go into a lodge don't hurt her because she's got a seal inside of her amen she can't lose that seal because she sealed unto the day of redemption amen she's also gonna be submissive to God in her soul exactly right your sister go with your husband what I thought come out of her my people she already has come out she already has come out by the Holy Ghost but don't be partakers of what they're doing so you're supposed to love your husband love love is what does it use beer Oh salty go get thirsty there's anything in it there's my timer I gotta close up here don't join their denomination you stay away for that denomination don't join it you can go to it you can't get a whole loaf get a hat get a half just get a slice see but that's the way you'll win your husband by doing that don't be arrogant then he'll know this is beautiful don't be arrogant then he'll know he's got just as much as you have enough powerful key message people be mayor arrogant yeah sometimes messages people could be arrogant we've all seen five like there they got it all figured out they're better than everybody else we must have confidence in the word and know our position in Christ but you have to take I'm not the heir or not looked out upon them and think we're somebody better than them but when you can show something that you have that you don't have that will make them thirst to be like you the sanctified wife sanctifies the husband now mother my sister if your husband wants you go down to the Methodist Church you go ahead you might not have a whole loaf of bread but if they even say they had the glee Jesus Christ son of God you go that you believe that because we do too now if they're going to go off on other Tantrums just let that go but you eat that much of the bread see and in that you just show by the sweetness of your life and your consideration for others if you haven't got a dear sister pray till it comes to you that you won't have to put on anything artificially because when you do that it's not real your husband can tell that in that something people without the Holy Ghost you can tell other people that don't have the Holy Ghost right they can down they can tell when something's put on why because that's what they do all the time they can send that oh this isn't real love this is a real dedication this isn't real submission right right brothers and sisters this isn't a real submission they're just going along with it is they know they have to but praying until you can obey and submit from the heart I'll be like that like out here honey I try to close when you really afraid to a place so your life is full of salt the Savior it'll make a contact if I'd be living about raw meant to be I go but be careful real careful don't join their church don't please don't do that don't you join their church we go on see that here's a white divorcing a believing husband I said your other brand my wife and I are separated she swing me for divorce she's not a Christian but I'd be the message you want to be saved and that nice real Christian spirit Emily but my side do we also have two boys brother look let me tell you she's going to sue you for divorce that's Satan you shouldn't do that but if your eye Christian had done something in the world to hit her that woman that it's Satan doing that he's only trying to tear you up now if she's the one that God selected she will come to him other words should come out of that marriage soon or divorce sooner or later if she's not she's not worth worrying about look at that statement ah that takes sovereign that takes anointing of a sovereign grace of God because you married this person you have two boys with this person you love this person for the rabbit now look look what he says though because if you worry he said it'll break your health down and that's what Satan wants you to get I don't have the facts in front of me but I've heard preachers preach about how stress can cause all types of diseases program so that's just Satan trying to upset you to give you some disease and kill you because you're basically to see how we must take care of our health our bodies because it's a it's a reflection of what's in our human spirit you don't take care of your body it shows you're not take care of your spirit but a real Christian will take ours temple why because it's not your temple it's the temple of the Holy Ghost is that when a man is not yours it's God's Amen and he purchased it with his own blood other than it's alright first finish up your steps we're bought with the price the precious blood of Jesus she said you just commit the holding to God and you got to take rest and just be as happy as you can be can you imagine that I can imagine that in the midst of the horse the Holy Ghost should make you as happy as you could be that takes the power of God well you know what that church that takes a submissive spirit to God nothing higher dismiss your God why it allowed me to be divorced kind of white allow this to happen God why do this why you that that's a higher dismisses but God I love you anyway I pure I'm living true God help me to be faithful you help me to pray until she comes back to God amen Liberty says she's going to divorce me anyhow I haven't done nothing if I have revealed to me now there's a real sincere pressure if I had caused my boots cause I've done something to my wife and caused a divorce me reveal it to me I'll go make it right I'll do anything that's a real submissive spirit right there now here let me bring this up trying to closer this still enjoying us how you enjoy this I got race this is bringing the gospel home right having the submissive spirit the sister is submissive and the men's submissive to the Holy Ghost submissive to the Holy Ghost now there was time a prett there was one time Abraham had to submit to see him remember that Sarah said kick out the bondwoman she's not inherited with the free woman remember that and so Abraham went to God and God said do what she said hearken unto her in other words obey her but see God told him to do it the first time he hearkened unto her and God didn't telling him the heart and that's the difference God told me to obey my wife and set up my just going to obey my wife 9 church and nothing gets all wise we loved Evan my life's a godly woman and I believe I've gifts of God in her life that I see operate on our marriage in our life you know but I wouldn't know from God first because God called me to make the final decision because if not if I let my wife decide or in other words if we let if we let the denominations of science set of God will be double guilty by the ramp sets you have a compound judgment on the day of judgment a man that doesn't lead and have his wife follow and lets her leave of absence punished double-double guilty here it is prevention there's a question here might answer right here I seen this morning said you're always harping about women how they must wear their hair but you never say nothing about the men if I see a baby over here with long hair any doubt is back like a woman that's it mister why don't you go to the barber shop look like see but men usually don't do that not as mad now now has the infallibility man but they're just as guilty as the wound see men are not infallible brothers if you think mama has a hold of infallible you're wrong if you think your valley are just as good as the Pope which isn't very good because he thinks he's infallible right when he speaks from st. Peter's Basilica they say he's infallible nonsense but as it and by the way brothers a man that will let his wife do that he's guilty double of it because he's supposed to be the one that has the say-so in the house and that man can't even rule his own house how could he do it in the house of God see he's guilty because he left his right and then he lets her lead he's double guilty not guilty for me see that in the program says I'm so thankful for the group of sisters I am thankful for the sisters in our church - they're godly sisters submissive sisters sweet soft disposition sisters right amen if our sisters battle at our disposition just take it to the Lord in prayer sisters and brothers of you battle that softness and I'm too tired to rule to a two-tire to make a decisions that God increased my strength restore my zeal restore my vision on the leader help me to find the leadership of the Holy Spirit that my wife can gladly follow it she'll see God now I'm going to skip past this let's get past that I'm going to close the two more things number brother branham's wife one-timer give him a little bit you remember when I've reaches a bridge hands it remember when it reaches okay superoxide appreciation of Mount Isis boat bless your heart good memory and then the story was he was going to have meetings but then he got a fever for nine days and sat in the bed and was all discouraged he goes that he wanders the God even call me a preach I can relate to that I can relate to that sick and not being able to preach somewhere not being able to do this or not seeing the results you want to see I can relate to that I've got a Lord I know will of God I did something wrong look what he says here oh no I'm sorry okay yeah let me yeah I'll skip it yeah so I sent down a motion to her and got it over closely I said Nita sometimes I wonder I wonder what's the matter why would that meetings be there and God let me lay like this and I said why was it and I said sometimes I wonder if he even called me can you imagine he's almost 50 years old seeing all these miracles raised the dead you know it's that wonder if God even called me to preach she said ain't you ashamed of yourself I don't know how she said it Church so no but your own interpretation to this okay see as she told me bill don't you know that God knows what he's doing with you just be just be quiet so brothers if you get romancing he was real tired and weak and worn out if you get really weak and worn out so our questioning you're wrong with God I wonder if I'm even a Christian if your wife has to rebuke you and tell you please stop talking honey would you please stop uttering those words about belief what you could say what brother Graham had to do the same thing me too had you the same thing and brother Graham thank her for that he said so I went and that kind of rebuked me a little you know his wife rebuked him now of course I'm sure she did it really submissively right look what he says earlier he said this he said oh yeah he said you know I'm sorry I'm tested you know I'm so thankful for a god-given wife aren't you a real companion so sometimes a real companion when you're really loaded that's the bad decision sometimes a real companion might have to rebuke you a little bit you like that by God's grace I thought I was so good look at that aren't you ashamed of yourself don't you know you're Oh God to preach don't you know you're called to lead the bride just be quiet now again sisters I'm not giving you permission to review your husband I'm just telling you that this happened to brother I was like and at the end of it he was thankful that shows that he was wrong he was he got to love we got to discourage now here's a here's another one to wear brother branham caused me to to live member that we invited the IRS agent Graham said he was so nervous he had already had meetings all morning with the IRS they sent him home and said we're not we don't need any more meetings and they called him up and said oh we change their mind I want you to come back in Graham said he felt like his head was coming off I was so weary so see what happens Satan tries to get you discouraged when you're tired or worn out you know what I did I said tell though I'm out here right now and around the house and went around behind the house when I come back in about why he looked at me and she said darling she said Billie was that just exactly righteous look how she brings the correction this time was that exactly right she didn't preach at him right she just said was that exactly right I said sure it was I wasn't in there right then but you see sometimes you act like it's the truth when it's still alive God don't want us to lie or tell little white lies or dodge around the corner everything's got to be right out and aboveboard okay I went to pray and he worshiped until he cried and he said God you forgive me I don't care because my life I said you forgive her I was the cause of her saying it Lord she shouldn't have said it now look she had a right to say no bill I'm not gonna lie to him she had the right because a man can't force a woman to disobey the word Kenny we just saw that earlier message he tells you to disobey the word get right to not not listen to that and hear what I said she should not have done that forgive her but I was the one I added to have her say that never see the balance here by God's grace he went told the higher SAT he said it's all right brother Branham I guess you're so tore up and he said my head felt like it was going to come off see how feeling get the way but that doesn't make any difference and don't get any room to lie I should tell the truth regardless of how much it hurts let's tangle our feet a submissive spirit to the holy spirit I don't want a submissive spirit to the holy spirit sometimes we wonder why our home life is out of control have we submitted to the Holy Spirit and we obeyed everything the Lord setting what is our disposition toward the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit said raise your hands and worship or all these fears to go to the altar pray or the Holy Spirit said sing a song special or the Holy Spirit says do these things would we submit to it go make this right with your husband go make this right with your life make this decision go sacrifice this for the kingdom of God and change your life and do how they would do it by God's grace it takes a submissive spirit see can you see how this compared see the others can help the whole life but also the church you must be submitted to the Holy Spirit here at church you must understand there's times where we're down and we may need a little bit of review maybe they need a little bit of correction but see God always brings it right back in order the Royce does let's bow our heads here does anybody need prayer today what anybody raise their hands they pray for me brother Jeff priest - Heavenly Father we thank you for your mercy thank you for your life knowing my hands up - Lord I want a submissive spirit to the Holy Spirit if the spirit would say come to church early and pray or fast and pray on Friday night or fast and pray on Saturday morning but I want to be submissive to that voice dear cop or we don't want to hire a disposition to the Holy Ghost we don't want to be too proud to repent of our sins as brother Ram said to cry the weep and go to the altar we only need to proud to do that - too much of a I are in this position we don't want to try to hide idols under our excuses why just can't overcome we don't want to hide sin under excuse where my heart goes out to this church so and I think of the kadish Barney and I think of the set or the Philistines are upon the grant a Barack I think of these things and what it comes right to our life Lord God what's right to our church help us Lord God look at our hearts the true church will let you search the reigns of their hearts Lord that each and every soul and heart I pray right now may they open up their heart Lord God let you search if there be anything that would not please you or God we pray Lord confession would flow from their lips door sincere confession we thank the Lord for these things we've heard more the truth we've heard give us wisdom Lord God especially with our families knocked out give us wisdom here at the church Lord to submit to the Holy Spirit but I believe I have submitted to preaching your word rule as I sit in the quietness and look to you lord I don't take any influence from anyone else on what

wrote deepens the family things but I always put all my he knows if any couple ever need counseling like that meeting about anything I'm happy to do that by God's grace I can be a help in any way I like to do that I have gone to marriage banquets and preached thing I've seen I've seen God helped numerous couples but I've also seen where one person wants help and the others unwilling and that just breaks but you know God is with that person to midst the trial is with me it's the drop what's the thing to do keep your health strong right be happy the Lord trust in God through any trial and God will bring you out if you trust it never doubt though surely bring you out I've seen message you know marriage is the message a greater and greater you know a more lovely Christ each other and I've also seen divorces creatures I've seen awful things so no there's a need for our sisters to remain submissive and our brothers to remain led by the holy face we both to take their positions I understand that by Dianna has my heart of course goes out to that you know families can be a little bit of minister in there to marry couples that were thankful for that we want to be able to be corrected by the Holy Spirit over what you want to be able to be correct about industry if we can be corrected by always rhythm can be corrected so let's just closing word prayer a father love your chances I love your word I love reading the church age but read the Bible studying these quotes preaching these things you are the number one love in my life I want to be submissive to you that I can be a strong leader to my wife that my wife will continue just gladly submit with a soft disposition as a as every couple Lord as every married couple would like this church no doubt I pray for every
