Description:
The Lord Jesus Christ has given our dear brother, Michael McCloskey, a tremendous testimony about the power of forgiveness. After being wrongly shot in 2009 and paralyzed from the waist down, God got ahold of Michael's heart and life. Seven years later, Michael publicly forgave his shooter, while holding a King James Bible, in front of the judge, his shooter, and Toledo's television news cameras. Michael is currently believing Jesus for a complete healing from his paralysis and spreading the testimony of Christ's power to forgive with those around him.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
my name is Michael John McCluskey jr. 32 years old I was raised by a loving mother and loving grandfather and father I knew his young man I always wanted to be a tradesman and was raised around a machinist and a welder it was 1994 I was I was at a Vacation Bible study and with some friends of mine from elementary school and gave myself to the Lord for the first time got down on my knees and said the sinner's prayer with a pastor there and just had a strong poll to know more about the Lord at that point through high school I worked arm jobs and at a high school I got my first break doing masonry graduated early and went into the trades and got a break for getting the union apprenticeship so I did a brief trial with the apprenticeship and ended up testing into journeyman Mason and Werth journeyman Mason for quite a few years I think about six years but in the beginning of that you know I had a high school I was always weight training and kind of catch up with my brother and you know being 10 years younger I was working that much harder you know they catch up and I could see God's hand on every part of my life even the weight training you know allowed me to train so hard in the gym five seven days a week dragging a trash can around with me while I would train building me up to 260 pounds where I would stop a 40-caliber bullet 240 green hollow-point at 15 feet the surgeon said within with an exit wound out of the front of my abdominal wall there would have been absolutely no chance of life due to the severe blood loss and let's see two and seven I started doing security work and was running my own company at the age of seventeen I you know started my own business on the side 18 years old was doing side jobs of construction and I was had an opportunity to start working for a facility remodeling it after work so I was working double shifts and and still weight training and I fought in a tough man contest actually these things of that nature you know growing up and competitive family type of scenario you know and so I started doing the nighttime security and got into a situation where work started getting slow where it pretty much took a crash and they wanted to hire me on full-time at this facility I had built doing security and building maintenance so I was real torn in between it was kind of something just kept telling me don't do it don't don't go down that road and I couldn't figure out what it was so I actually sat down for the first time in my life and rode out pros and cons of what was telling me you know not to do this now I had forgotten a few months prior to that that I had had a dream that I was shot up of a black harley-davidson Softail motorcycle that I hadn't even owned yet and later on after forgetting his dream I had purchased this motorcycle and actually ended up moving into a neighborhood a fancier neighborhood you know and took my business with me and my work trucks and was living in this neighborhood for a while and was working the night doing security and working my day job also run inside jobs so just running fit and running myself then one day I was working diligent you know I was running all over the place and someone I didn't know where just said Mike what's going to happen if someone pulls a gun on you and I said it would take a bullet to slow me down like it just fell out of my mouth it is something that I had heard in my past and when I said it I thought to myself why did I even say that but I just kept on with my work it wasn't but a short time after that I was actually shot in the back off of a harley-davidson Softail black just like the dream I didn't know that yet the most important thing about this is the moment when I was shot when that bullet hit me I knew instantly that I was paralyzed and when I fell to the ground and I was looking around me I knew I had already been there before it was such a moment that I was already there I've already been here I'm looking at the police officers around me pointing guns at me still even though my hands are up and I knew it I already had been there and didn't know how I didn't know where the man that was my assistant manager I had just left work when this had happened my assistant manager pulls up and sees me on the way to my house sees me laying on the ground shot he gets out of his car he runs up to me and I was in the most excruciating pain I've ever felt in my life I would never want anyone to feel this pain and when he approached me there was a what I understand now to be an anointing on this man he was glowing like an angel very bright glow around him it took my pain from me man's name is Clint sharp I couldn't speak to him he I couldn't hear what he was saying and I had no pain but comfort as this glow around him started to recede started to go away the pain came right back hit me strong right away and I told him take off your shirt pack my wound get the bike off of my leg the gasoline is going to burn me up call 9-1-1 that was the unit that was actually dispatched that came out and got me off the road and took me to the hospital and I had laid on the ground for an hour and 45 minutes waiting for that help to come I spent 40 days in tweedle hospital they saved my life the surgeon came out and told my mother that he had never seen a man lose that much blood and still have a heartbeat and he said it was a tear in his eye the surgeon that had been you know with emergency surgeries for over 30 years and like I said I spent about 40 days in the hospital that was a very painful experience if I could warn anybody about the experience of taking a bullet I I would strongly advise them that you would never want to feel pain like that or the repercussions of pain like that they did exploratory surgery on my body pulling out all my organs cutting out hemorrhage muscle and meat my abdominal wall throwing most of that stuff away sewing me ball back up I remember I had a dream while I was in an ICU that I was in hell and that I was actually fighting demons and fighting my way through these different levels of hell and I got to a point to her I was surrounded by these demons and I had thought the only what can I do what can I do in this situation and I remembered our Lord Jesus Christ and I got down on one knee and I stuck my sword in the ground and I called out and said Lord Jesus Christ please save me and a lightning bolt struck me and it was like it I it took me right out of that place and it was the brightest white when this lightning bolt hit it was the brightest white I've ever seen ever it was so such a pure white light and I woke up out of an induced a coma from this and remember hearing my heart monitors and I looked down and I could see all my organs I was stapled shut but you I was so swollen you could see everything everything in me you could see my heart you could see my my intestinal you know intestines in me very traumatic experience very humbling experience to go from a very large man always in control of his situation no fear prideful you know just live in that past life and to be humbled that quickly was a very traumatic experience they set out I see you that I was saying induced a coma they said I was saying God told me not to have any hatred in your heart towards this police officer I don't recall saying this the first couple times but after coming you know into a step-down unit they had told me what I said and I continued to repeat that and tell everybody that came to visit me it was very important to me that they didn't have any hatred towards this man being the people that were working with me two people that I knew that there wasn't any retaliation that something I the Lord had told me I believe that this was somehow on me you know something I had done or said or whatever it be I didn't know any of that at that time but something was telling me that that everybody just needed to be peaceful about the situation and I had a preacher come to to my hospital room and really put some words of encouragement in me and my my family they just that they kept telling me in the hospital you know you could still die and your pancreas you know could put out enzymes and kill you and all this and I would just say when y'all let me out of here when do I get to go home I'm okay I'm going to be fine ever you know Lord's protecting me I'm gonna be all right it was not too long that I was released it was around 40 days I believe I was released and I went home to my mother's house you know I had lost my residency where I was living and it was important I got out of that area due to the fact that just the neighborhood I had moved into they didn't really they didn't really like the blue-collar work trucks and everything that I had going on so I decided to get out of that neighborhood and moved back in with my mother and I was in my bedroom and it hit me that I had had that dream I remembered the dream 100% and I realized that when I was laying on the ground shot I was actually remembering the dream the Lord had tried to sharpen me of my future I had forgot that dream when I thought I had to move into that neighborhood because all my options you know with work had gone out and I moved in with the gentleman that owned the home there I couldn't figure out why I was so torn what what inside of me and my mind kept saying do not go there and I didn't listen to that and I started getting a full picture of what took place there and that was a very powerful moment for me not too long after that I went this facility a lot of people kept saying I'll come back you know we friend of mine had an annual work cut out get-together there so I went back there and I was outside the back of the building about 40 yards away from the back door in four inches of snow cold outside talking to the man that saved my life and he had watched a documentary about the Rosetta Stone and how it predated Christ and he was telling me that that that couldn't be real but you know the story of Christ could be real because this predated that and and I could was trying to get a word in and I couldn't and I had a tears coming out of my eyes and I just closed my eyes and I started saying don't worry Michael God loves you don't worry Michael God loves you don't worry Michael God loves you and the door on the back of the building open and a lady dressed as an angel happened to be around that time walk straight out to me and asked me what's your name and I said my name is Michael she said what happened to you and I said I was shot off of my Harley Davidson for going seven miles an hour over the speed limit and she said that's terrible can I give you a hug and I said I would love a hug right now and I hugged her and she whispered in my ear don't worry Michael God loves you and as I looked over to Clint to tell Clinton what she had said he was in Koval shion's he couldn't breathe I thought he was having a heart attack or was going into a seizure that has appeared after I got him to the baptism Lord got him to the baptism I reran that story through and he stopped me and he said I got to tell you something this is seven and a half years later he said the reason that I went into what seems like a full seizure was that when that lady dressed as an angel whispered to your ear there was a glow around you guys which I understand now to be a very strong anointing and the reason you ran in and out of the building was he was trying to see where he seen that light because after she had departed walked back into the building he ran in and looked at her and I was running back out looking at me and he said it was all dark around us there was there was no light there was it wasn't he thought something this perception was off or something you know and then which I understand knowledge and I knew at that moment it was a very supernatural moment and I just stands out to me you know through that bat doesn't mean he come out and told me what happened there that was another profound moment it was it was the second moment that I had in a very short time that was making me look around and touch things and pinch myself to see if I was awake if this was a mirage like and then I knew how serious and how real the spiritual realm was around us it was a quite quite a moment for me I was in and out of different churches I was baptized wrong I was baptized in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost didn't even know it went to a few was going to prayer services ended up you know just seeing red flags you know didn't really know much about denomination had some had some tough times my my grandfather died of cancer and on his deathbed said it was he felt like it was from what happened to me just just took the life right out of him and it wasn't too long much after I was shot he come down with the cancer and had passed away and it was not but a few years ago I was taking my father to church the evangelical church and trying to get him to come to the Lord with me and I took him to a service and it wasn't it wasn't really sure what he thought so I was invited him do another one he said well I'd like to get lunch with you Saturday so we went out to lunch and we're having a real good time having some good talks and he was we were kind of reflecting over things over the life and all the good moments and it was just a real good day and before we left that launch some people walked in that knew me from my incident and started bringing up the whole scenario about the police officer and got my father really fired up really upset and many times I forgive I tell my father I forgive this man I forgive him I forgive him I forgive this man I forgive him and he said I could never forgive him Ike for now because it does hurt him so bad to see his son and so much pain to be his legs taken from all of these situations were were really tough between us I just wanted him to know I'm alright I'm a strong I'm strong guy Lord's made me that way everything's going to be all right I forgive this man and he said never forgive them and I'm your father and you to listen me and I said the Lord Jesus Christ is my father and he had went home not agreeing to go to church Sunday the next morning and then he text me and said I'll be at your house in the morning to go to church I said that'd be great father and now he never showed up and ended up shooting himself committing suicide and it was just a real tough moment I kind of got the atmosphere at that church was was a real standoffish and I just kind of went back to home every time I would go to one of these you know one of these assemblies and just see things that were red flags to me I would just go back to my home just mean the dog back to me in the dog back to me in the dog and one day I was in my house just thinking about everything that had happened you know I'm down to me and my mother and my friends were burning bridges with me even though worldly friends I was trying to help them out and like my situation with my parents were kind of getting abrasive you know and I was just I just cried out to the Lord in tears just yelling in my house that I needed the truth I needed the church and I needed now I can't wait no longer Lord and my phone had went off and a really good brother that I know that I've known for years contacted me and he had said brother the Lord has been telling me all day long to get a hold of you and to send my cousin over for a Bible study this man his name's Adam down the line and I said brother you sending he said you sure I said send him so a day went by and he said well I'm not able to make it I said send him he said are you sure I said I'm positive I want to know I'm going to heaven I don't want a shadow of doubt I want to know so he says okay I'll send him so he sends assignment over I learned this name Simon so he comes and comes up to my door you know and I look out and I'm like aw he's got a work van and I hope the door and I see him like he's a tradesman you got tape measure on you know so I'm like imma give him the Christian test I come in for a hug hey give me a hug I said alright this is looking good so he comes in and he goes into my house and he he looked out my window and he's seen my business sign said MCW certified welding and he looked at me and he said you're a welder and I said yes and he goes I'm a welder and right then I thought about Jesus and Joseph and carpentry and I thought pray to God he sent me a tradesman I'd do it right then I knew I was having one of those moments that I had had before you know just knew that I just couldn't quit thinking about that prayer that I had said Lord I need the truth and you know this it was right when I was about to make my own move I picked another church and I was like well I'm going to go here and and search it out and see if it feels right and before I could make that move Simon was standing on my porch and that was that really stood out to me that was just I knew it was a divine moment right there and thanks to a broken clock we did a seven-hour Bible study praise the Lord it was good and that was eleven eleven twenty sixteen and eleven thirteen twenty sixteen I was baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ for the mission of my sins so I shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit and that was an amazing moment I had was baptized I come up out of the water and they laid hands on me and I I felt for the most part pretty normal things were like okay this is a really special moment and help get me out of the water and I started wheeling away and pastor Cameron Smith said get hands on him right now and they rushed over to me and they all laid hands on me getting started praying and I believe my hands went up like this and it felt like someone kicked the wind out of me like right in the stomach right my solar plex and I just went and I can't describe what happened there I think the Lord only knows what happened there but it was a very defined moment again I just I knew that that was a real baptism a big difference from being baptized falsely twice in the past you know and after that I'd started witnessing to people I mean I I don't think I could keep my battery on my phone going I was just calling everybody reaching out to everybody and got a got the gospel to a few people I heard a sermon from a brother preacher sandy beach and he preached on circumcision of the heart from the flesh and he hid repentance real good the true definition of repentance and I had no idea I didn't know it was that deep and that Monday morning after that service that Monday morning I made a call to the prosecuting attorney's office and requested for a meeting and he didn't call me back the next day so I called him again he said oh well I was thinking what kind of time frame you thinking and I said immediately I need to get down to talk to you so he made an appointment for the following week not on Wednesday and I went down there and talked to him and told him that I wanted to forgive this police officer and I told him what it all happened with my grandfather and my father and we were both crying and I told him a little bit about serpentine I said you know it kind of comes back to the the incident you know in a detail but I said our seed line comes from Cain and he said Abel write back to me right then and and I said oh you know something about this and he goes Mike I've been praying for you ever since you were shot that you're going to come down here and forgive this man he's a good Christian this is the federal prosecutor and so it worked out where he set it up I went down there for a little like a mock trial type of deal like and I got to have about 40 minutes with this police officer alone in a room by my request for this and he gave me one of the most sincere apologies that I've ever heard in my life he was crying I was crying we hugged I said a prayer and that prayer said in that prayer I asked the Lord of all negativity hatred any emotions attached to this would stay in that room and I let that man walk out ahead of me and I closed the door behind us and that was the end of it and we went out in front of the courtroom they gave me a opportunity to speak and I told in front of three different news channels in the entire city of Toledo Ohio what true repentance really was and that through the King James Bible I was taught proper Christianity and it was amazing moment I really don't even remember saying anything as far as that goes but I was just amazing that the Lord allowed all of that to come out it was they did a beautiful job on those four this morning a man in a wheelchair wholeheartedly forgives the man who shot him putting him in that chair former Ottawa Hills Police Officer Thomas wife wise to stand trial again after an appeal but his victim asked that the case be resolved our Michelle Zepeda was in the courtroom and watched as both families wanted peace Michelle what happened in the Honorable Gary cooks courtroom took us all by surprise Mike McCloskey was once an angry man and struggled after being paralyzed today he gave everyone hope and hope that his acts of forgiveness would move others to consider love rather than hate oh I think the Lord Jesus Christ through King James Bible teaching me what repentance truly is I cannot hold you the most is bad and I can cry with a smile now 32 year old Mike McCloskey called prosecutors two weeks ago asking to resolve this case that was set for retrial his strength and courage and his compassion as an example for all of us and mr makovski is what drove us being able to resolve this McCluskey had one request to meet face to face with white before the hearing so he could forgive him for what happened back in 2009 McClosky says they prayed together that prayer was a prayer forgiveness that he can truly get the forgiveness that he deserves for his family and know that life that I myself and my family are going to be okay and it was prayer in his religion that McCloskey says had given him a new lease on life and allowed him to give Thomas white a fresh start as well I think it's a an excellent example of forgiveness which a lot of times we don't see no way pled no fine I just really want to say thank you Lord our Lord Jesus Christ for opening up my eyes bringing me the truth of what true repentance really is I just want to pray that this is a powerful testimony that this can help people understand what your repentance is and that the reading of life is love in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I can't say enough there's not enough words but the words are in this King James Bible and I know that's the truth and what has done to me is unexplainable but it is opened up my spirit and opened up my eyes and took off the blinders and I just want to share that with there's many people that it can get out and I didn't prepare a speech I just wanted him to come right through him that Holy Ghost his channel rings at the trial when I after I gave my statement to the judge he had told me that he was going to grant my request due to my testimony about the Lord Jesus and my clear judgment on my situation and how I felt towards his police officer which was 100% sincere forgiveness with all of my heart you see my emotions I told him I could cry with a smile because the Lord Jesus has got his hand on everything after that I kept witnessing to people I got three of my close friends from childhood baptized they came to the Lord and it's been it's been an amazing experience we had a really good service one night really anointed service just the Holy Ghost service and I we had left and was driving home and I had I had painted I used to have pain spasm severely you know and I was driving home and I turned on the airport highway and a pain spasm hit me so bad that I would crushed my steering wheel with my hands and I cried out to the Lord and said I love you Lord Jesus and it felt like a bucket of warm water was poured over me all the way down me inside now and it went all the way down and it hit my feet and I could feel my legs I could touch my legs I felt them I felt them connected to my body and it was just it's an amazing experience when you go from t12 paralysis to healed and I am healed by His stripes I was healed 2,000 years ago isaiah 53:5 and says that and i stand on that word to this day and i just wanted to give this testimony you know why had the opportunity still sitting in this wheelchair to just give the Lord's give the Lord the testimony on this so I'm giving this testimony for the glory of the Lord's Kingdom and I pray that it can it can touch people's lives that they can see that you can speak life or death into your body with your tongue you really got to watch what you say that's one thing that really stands out to me another thing that really stands out to me is how he had his gentle hand on me the whole time has held me from death more testimonies than I could put on this video how many of my friends that were very close to me that have died and when I was right next to him I mean it come he's kept me from death so many times and I see the strong it pulls on me about salvation how he was guiding me towards it the whole time and the special moments even some that were small or some that were very great that was his voice talking to me that was his actions pulling on me saying come closer my son and I I just I pray that that through all this that forgiveness is a very important part of this that you have to forgive your trespasses you have to love your neighbors it is so very important that you just forgive everybody and just cast those cares aside and and just put it in prayer and just trust on the Lord and have faith that your prayers are answered pray for them and put them in past times and thank them you
