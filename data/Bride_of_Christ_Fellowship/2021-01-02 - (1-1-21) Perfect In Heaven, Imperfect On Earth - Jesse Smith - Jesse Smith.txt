spiritual chain of events that happened i'll share a little bit about that but i preached on job a little bit there and the people were really blessed in a wonderful service so i just thought i would continue a little more with job but job chapter one verse one there was a man in the land of us whose name was job and that man was perfect and upright and one that feared god and eschewed evil i want to skip down to verse 8 and the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and upright man one that feareth god and a skeweth evil praise god let's have a few prayer requests here tonight let's remember my dad that's part of the testimony i got to i got to pray with my dad and tell him about the curses on his life it was really

over i have some quotes i'd like to share here in some scriptures so i'll make sure i got everything i need and we'll get right into the word of god here tonight jose got me this tie and he said uh a while ago i think for my birthday and he's like hey how come you haven't worn that tie i said i'm going to wear that tie tonight so i got the tie on in honor of our brother jose so you know i just got so many ties in there i just usually take the newest one you know which one's ready to go i'm going to wear that one so i never this first time i tied this one so thank you jose if he's live streaming bless you sir and let's get to the word of god and let me just share about this week you know it was a real strange week i was tuesday morning i was sitting and working on the book um and uh i got a text from mothercam i thought huh nice to hear from camp he said are you preaching tomorrow night i said no sir i said we're uh we're having service on friday instead he said would you like to preach for me tomorrow i said well let me text my wife and previously you know my wife and i were talking i wanted to go see my dad over break uh to tell him about the curses and blessings i was preaching on and i told him about i told him when i felt i was under the spirit and i cursed that spirit of depression on him in jesus christ's name many a few weeks ago many weeks ago and by now i told him about it yesterday but i was telling my wife i said over a break one of those days i want to go see my dad and tell him about blessings and curses and so you know cam didn't know that cam just said the holy spirit put me on his heart and so i said and he said well if it's of god it'll be on working on both ends well i i was working on my end because i was gonna come back and see my dad so i talked to my wife and she's like yeah that'd be great let's go see cam um so on wednesday you know we left what yeah we left wednesday yeah got there got to see my mom a little bit i didn't get a chance to talk to her about the letter because we never got any private time but anyways you know i get you you recall i wrote her the letter and uh about her repenting and the dream she had coming to me for help and she told my sister she wasn't uh ready to make it right yet although she said my letter was true um so anyways i passed it all day preach wednesday night well the camp said that a great move of the holy spirit he said he hasn't seen that many people come forward for prayer in a while so i felt i felt very thankful the holy spirit could meet people's needs the cam told me brothers were calling themselves driving on the way home talking about the word of god and everything for half an hour just talking about the sermon now when was the last time you did that i just thought what a blessing the holy spirit really moved there so i thank the lord for that well then that morning the next morning thursday cam and i were just fellowshipping and then i went over to see my dad uh and i just waited on the holy spirit you know he's i let him preach a little bit you know he likes to preach and his side of the story and i just waited for my time and then i started telling him i said dad you won't know what's wrong you're under a curse and he looked at me he stopped me and said you're right the lord just showed me that two nights ago and i said you're cursed because you have so much hatred in your heart i said your dad cursed you the marine corps cursed you i said all these workers have cursed you and i said dad the only way to be free is to forgive them and you know i went on i told him everything i've told you i that's that's the best conversation i've ever had with my dad in 40 years the best conversation i've ever had finally i had to go i said let me pray for you and i said i bless you dad i said there's power of life in the tongue i bless you in the name of jesus christ and i curse that spirit that's on you it's gonna leave i said satan get behind him and he looked at me and the first time he's ever said this he said thank you brother for praying for me he called me brother he's never called me brother before and i said dad i bless you when i was leaving i said dad i bless you in jesus christ's name again he said i already feel it and he was i was crying you know he was crying it was really a special thing now i don't know how long it will take him to get out of that and to go forgive those people make it right but i've never i just never experienced such a leadership of the lord going from you know cams to the brother my dad's and then just seeing how god directed everything everything was just led to the lord like that so i believe i'm walking under the leadership of the holy spirit they that are led of the spirit are the sons of god amen so i'm very thankful to be a son of god tonight praise god uh so just so that's just a real brief testimony i said dad i said you had your experience in 1983 when i was three years old where the holy ghost met him in the prayer closet and he said it swept into the room it made him run up to his bed and when he landed on the bed the holy spirit smacked his feet it went through his chest his whole body he felt like he never smoked a cigarette in his life but then the day after he went in the closet and said i don't need you anymore god i got my job back and he said that's where he made his mistake so i said dad you know what you got to do you got to go back in the prayer closet so we'll see but i said 40 years from 1983 is 2023. israel had to wait 40 years until they could go in the promised land so i said dad i don't know if it's next year or the year after i said one of these years our family's going to be restored i said you're going to take the promised land that's my belief anyway that's what i feel that of the lord i didn't i'm not speaking with thus saith the lord but that's what i feel because i believe god has shown me these things i preach these things and i'm trusting god to do it that that's my hope i never said that's thus saith the lord but that is my hope and it's beautiful just to see god vindicate it with brother cam and then with uh you know my dad himself so i thank the lord for that and please just read if you think of it just remember him in prayer church that god will finish the work he started you can switch over here i do have a few quotes here would like to share tonight just thought i'd share that testimony and to me that is a great testimony praise god to me that is a great testimony let me lock this in here because i'm having trouble is it not going over maybe oh i think i probably got the wrong cord here no here let me switch ones and it should be the regular one which it which one is the regular one the tv pc okay there we go thank you sorry about that all right so let's look here to the word of god tonight you love the lord tonight amen hallelujah i love him with all my heart praise god let's look at job here tonight and my thought for tonight was this is what the saints really like just this idea of perf perfection in heaven we're perfect in heaven but we're still imperfect on earth so let's look at this thought here and uh by god's grace we'll minister here and and that's how we want to uh start 2021 right we want to remember god has made us perfect in heaven while we battle our imperfections on earth so i don't want to forget that praise god so uh we look open up this book what a beautiful book job is um and you know we start with the heavenly courtroom you know heaven is such an amazing place we looked at it last week remember we looked at last week there's a there's the all there's all the courts that moses built right you have the outer court you have the sea of glass and the outer cart israel stands on that after the 144 000 are sealed with the holy ghost they stand on that in heaven then closer in the holy place you have the altar of incense in heaven the souls under the altar are the jews right so thus saith the lord brother ram said the fifth seal the souls are the altar of the jews you have the outer court sea of glass you have the holy place you have the altar of incense where the jews are under the altar then in the holiest of holies you have the throne of god and jesus sits on the throne of god ruling all heaven and all eternity praise god amen and he sits there and four beasts around him clapping i'm sorry flapping the ring saying holy holy holy is the lord god almighty praise god there's seven spirits there's seven lamps there praise god there's 24 thrones hallelujah surrounding him there's innumerable angels there's a rainbow round about the throne praise god the saints of god are there as well and robes of white hallelujah abraham's there amen job's there daniel's there amen they're there in the holy some holies amen and jesus sits there on the throne making intercession for you and i praise god but we know in heaven you know we know also that there is a uh there is constant activity remember it goes really fast in heaven really slow on earth the bible says there's a day when the sons of god come to present themselves before the lord and satan comes among them so notice god has a certain time period where every demon has to come and report before him he's in control of everything praise god he's in control of heaven and i'll say like this he's in control of earth he's in control of this bride he's in control of your life as well amen nothing gets by god because he's in full control of every activity praise god remember that satan couldn't even touch job he couldn't even he couldn't even get through any heads the hedge was so strong he couldn't even get any close why because god was protecting him let me say thank you jesus for protecting me in 2020 amen oh yeah i got the hedge went down a little bit i got a little coronavirus but then the hedge came back thank you for that praise god amen uh you know the bible says he's he's my god that heals all my diseases praise god so see that he let the hedge back satan come in for a little bit but then he kicks satan out and the hedge is set up again praise god i've been sick since then that was november praise god i haven't been sick since then see god sets a hedge about his people but every demon in the heavenly realm has to come and present themselves before god and god said to satan god kind of uh challenges satan he says whence cometh thou and satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down it so god or jesus asks every demon what you're doing what are you doing right because they have to answer praise god they believe in the lord and they tremble can you imagine the bible said they'll tremble there in the friends of god he said what are you doing devil he says i'm just walking around the earth and i'm just seeking whom i may devour right that's what he does right and he can't lie in that presence amen he can lie to you he can lie to me but he can't lie in that presence amen hallelujah and so god commands him and tells him what are you doing you must tell me of course he knows too and that isn't that funny he also knows already he knows what they've been doing because he knows all things amen and so we know the story but i want to uh remember the bible said be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about sinking whom he may devour so peter plainly says god knows what satan's doing all the time but we don't right we don't always know so i don't want you to get too relaxed tonight i want you to be happy i want you to rejoice but i want you to leave out of here sober and vigilant amen because god knows what's going on and god won't let anything happen to us without his permission but at the same time we are told uh that we must be careful on the earth because there's lions waiting around corners waiting to devour us praise god we we're not here without an enemy now i'll tell you like this many times god gives us peace right we've had such a season of peace we talked about that really man do we we since god has driven away some of these contrary spirits out of our church we have had such a season of peace and that's scriptural asa had 10 years of peace because he he broke down every idol he cleaned out the house of god he drove out every demon out of the kingdom praise god and the bible said he didn't fight one battle for 10 years amen think about us how we can have seasons of peace praise god we drive out every demon power we pray it out we preach it out praise god and god gives us peace but we must remember we're still in the battle the bible said as a roaring lion satan's there walking about seeking who whom he may devour see satan wasn't lying to god that's exactly what he does go around the earth trying to get brother amen trying to get me and trying to get different ones of us right he's seeking him he's waiting like he's pouncing he's getting ready to pounce right but i thank god many times when he tries to pounce for the amen he hits that invisible wall that hedge of protection amen he can't go beyond that hallelujah thank god amen he couldn't get naomi right right with the the coven amen the hedge of protection hallelujah thank god see they try to get it they try to bring fear right they try to bring discouragement he tries to bring all these things church but if god says stop the devil has to stop amen hallelujah see he's trying to devour or consume our fruits of the spirit right he's trying to spoil the house and all the blessings in the house but the bible said resist him steadfast that means oppose him right stand against him fight against him praise god resist him steadfast in the faith praise god what is faith a revelation resistant with revelation amen god see god revealed to me this god told me this so you're wrong devil praise god the word of god says this so you're wrong i'm resisting you with the word of god and we remember the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren all around the world i'm not the only preacher battling things right preachers all around the world are battling what i battle little churches big churches right it doesn't matter right there's some there's another little preacher you know little church preacher who's bound the same things i am satan's trying to devour him the same way he's trying to devour me but the same god that protects him delivers him the same guy that will deliver me he'll protect me see remember we're not the only ones we're not to have a pity party although i was called pitiful last week i'm not having a pity party praise god remember believe the sign people call or no i'm sorry joseph people call me a beautiful human being last week oh my although they say i'm pitiful uh i'm not i'm trusting in the lord jesus christ amen i don't i don't i don't want to pity myself i want to be thankful in everything and the peace of god that passes all understanding will protect my heart and mind through christ jesus i don't feel sorry for myself we have so much to be thankful for praise god we just must we just must continually hunger and thirst for righteousness i want to be more like jesus i don't need more like the book of acts church i want to see god win souls because he that's wise win souls amen god give us some wisdom more wisdom praise god to win souls even though there's less and less but being saved the church is getting smaller and fewer and fewer god has to shorten the days so that some elect might be saved help us to find some of those a couple of those one of those however there are many are left let's ask god to give us wisdom to find them and then in job 2 again there's a day when the son of sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came among them to present himself before the lord see when god says all the devil's got to come back they got to come back right they've got to come on the day god says it and the lord said once cometh thou satan answered the lord going to and fro in the earth walking up and down it now i just heard a preacher say this this week if you want to listen to the sermon i'll let you listen to it it's a great a great sermon but i want you to notice how did god vindicate job to the devil was it by signs wonders and miracles look at all the miracles job did no because anybody can do that workers of iniquity can do that where's bang bang oh i'm sorry you must be out there i should have said that one thing i was saying i want to talk to thank you so bang and i talked to a preacher right and this preacher went to pentecostal churches and they have gifts where that preacher can just lay his hand on someone's forehead and they fall out and they get healed that's beyond any gift i've had right as far as like maybe i prayed for a few people like that and they passed out and healed them but not many i guess this guy just does it like automatically that's a great gift of god the bible said there's man there's one spirit there's many gifts there's many different operations of the gift praise god and that brother will have to answer not just for the gift but for the doctrine as well and that's where i feel real safe right there praise god i'm i'm telling the sisters to dress holy not cut your hair the men not to cuss and stay faithful to your wives right get the holy ghost live have temperance godliness patience and all these things don't smoke don't become a drug addict you know thank god don't put sinful things before your eyes amen so i'm thankful that our doctrine is right because i i i'll thank the lord for that but i want you to notice god vindicates job to satan because he has integrity and he's obedient to the word of god the same thing for you and i church let me tell you it's a greater miracle that you hate evil than if you could raise a physically dead person amen praise god it's a greater miracle if you can turn down sin on your phone or sit at the moving theater right or sin in your mind it's a greater miracle to turn down that it'll move devils faster praise god than any dead person you could raise from the dead because that's what god says that's his proof that job is the most holy man because he hates evil he loves me he worships me and so the vindication is a pure heart that loves holiness and hates sin praise god so what should be the vindication that that brother's a real preacher he preaches against sin and he lives a godly life now we will have these signs following us from time to time praise god thank god for that these signs will follow them that believe praise the lord but god when he vindicates someone to satan he says look how he hates you amen praise god amen he says satan will try to accuse me this is what i believe i hope is happening in heaven right now if not just a few moments ago well jesse did this just nope jesse is under the blood and jesse hates your temptations he's tired of it and he wants to go come to home to heaven when he's ready and done he wants a new body praise god where he don't have that sin nature in him anymore he hates evil he loves righteousness so god said to satan has you have you considered my servant job that there's none like him in the earth let me volunteer job for a test because mother said job was tested right and that's that's that's clear the bible says uh we're all tested like silver in the furnace remember seven times it must be passed through seven times and then it's made perfect we're all likened unto a medal that has to go through the fire the fiery trials of your faith is more precious than gold that perisheth amen life is a test life is a proving grounds amen to prove that we truly love jesus he's number one in our lives and our hearts are pure before god almighty that's what life is it's a test of our purity praise god have you seen job a message believer like him in the earth a perfect message believer upright one that fears god and hates evil and he holds fast as integrity now at this point he'd only lost his children well i should say only but you know he lost ten children can you imagine that seven boys three girls he lost all ten children he lost some servants right he lost all of his 401k which was five million dollars i worked it out one time he lost five million dollars he lost all of his children all he had left was his wife that's all he had left i'm sorry there was one servant that came back right with the news so he lost many servants remember the sabians came and the chao deans come in and destroyed everything took all of his took everything and so still after that what'd he say he said the lord gives and the lord takes away blessed be the name of the lord amen so he feared god and still he holds fast his integrity remember his wife said curse god and die he said speaketh like a foolish woman i'll speak us like a foolish virgin right although thou movest me against him to destroy him without cause so we see here is just a a tremendous picture now i want you to notice as we go along here job is strong at the beginning like a lot of us oh we got something bad happen right away oh that's the devil oh devil i'm going to overcome it i'm going to be healed right or oh god's going to change the situation but give it a few days give it a few weeks jobs turn into months the bible actually says months he said oh if i could go back to the months where my children sat at my feet and the glory of god was upon my head like oil and all the men came rushing to me and were silent until i spoke oh if i could just go back in all these months most of our months search are pretty good right when was the last time you had a huge trial that lasted months months i was sick two weeks maybe and just the fever just lasted one one or two three days whatever i cannot remember but months january february march april may just months almost a year and so he starts off strong like we do but then satan knows how to work and wear us down he knows how to just keep throwing things at us so pretty soon we our our arms get tired to hold up the shield right all right we get tired of it pretty soon church we just lay down right lay down i can't fight anymore and that's when the evil confession starts that's when the doubts start right because we're no longer chopping them away then we start saying maybe i did something wrong maybe i'm not saved maybe that person's not saved you know or whatever you know we start saying things we would not have uttered before maybe god doesn't love me maybe god doesn't care maybe there is no god for some people see but right away the lord gives the lord takes away i go to the house of god worship praise god but give it a few months give it a few months or give it a few years give it a few years this is what i want to do i want to be so strong in my spiritual exercise that i can battle the devil for a couple weeks or months or years at a time praise god praise god jesus was praise god amen 40 days without eden yet spiritually it was his body was weak but spiritually he was exercising that whole time and when satan offered the kingdom without going to the cross he was able to say no it is written thou shalt not worship allah shall only worship the lord thy god amen and he's almost sagging he's so tired he's almost staggering and then finally when satan leaves he goes down and the angels come and minister to him but spiritually he was so strong all he could say was it's written it's written it's written i will not defile my mind i will not define my body see he was strong in the face god help us to be strong in the faith no matter the trial that comes will be strong we'll be able to battle the devil and drive him off paul was strong right at the end he was in the prison but he said he said oh death where is your sting amen oh great where is your victory he said he said i know i fought the fight i finished my faith i've kept the course and i know there's a crown of righteousness awaiting for me and not just me but all those that love god's appearing amen praise god the spirit that's why we gotta read our bible and pray every day it's spiritual muscle building i'm amazed my brother got he got some pretty big muscles but that's because he works out for two hours a day that's pretty good that's pretty great you know my little brother i'm saying you know it takes two hours a day now if those natural muscles take two hours a day how much spiritual muscles are we gonna get if we're working out how long are we working out how long do we really listen to the sermon how long do we really pray or read our bible praise god see we want to be strong and the bible actually says that exercise exercise yourself more into godliness right the bible says that paul says that exercise he said god he said bodily exercise prophets a little he said but spiritual exercise profiteth both now for this world and in the world to come so god help us to be spiritually exercising some people are so weak spiritually and naturally they come to church and they just sleep the whole time see they've they've overworked their body and they're so they've overworked their body all they can do is come here and sleep in the presence of god i appreciate that they have peace enough to sleep here i appreciate that right i appreciate they're not being tormented by devils here right but the fact is that when the preaching of the word is life it's spiritual life it's god's waters flowing out and they're so they're so weak spiritually they can't even come up to the well and take a drink because you've got to pull on the word of god in other words you've got to come up and you've got to take a drink cup and you got a drink praise god i can't do it for you nobody can do it for you you've got a pole you've got to pull on the well praise god and i'll just use the illustration praise god you've got to pull in the water and then you've got to drink because so so many people are so weak and tired physically spiritually not exercising at home spiritually speaking that they come to the house of god and they're too weak to receive anything from god god have mercy but there will be no excuses on that day church we've had the message on our phones we've got message books we got bibles everywhere the now the bible will read it to you praise god you know you got to read it yourself and they'll dramatize it like with the right voice a male or female have music behind it and all the sound effects we got no excuses in this hour so when people are that weak it shows they're not exercising spiritually at home see now i spent a long time on that slide but anyway i just want you to see if god loved daniel surely he loved job daniel all's daniel did was fast and pray he said god i just wonder i want to understand prophecy where we are in the things of god so i'm going to fast and pray for that and the angel came and said i'm come to show thee for thou art greatly beloved amen praise god right daniel the devils are trying to accuse daniel the dead the devils in heaven actually uh anointed those men to try to put daniel in the lines then it was they had to get permission from god but the angel comes out and says listen daniel you you know i've we've heard your prayers heaven loves you so heaven is gonna send your answer but it had to get through all that heavenly uh that heavenly realm there's much battles going on there in the heavenly realm heaven loves you keep praying i'm going to send the answer keep believing heaven's going to win this war praise god oh don't be discouraged church if god loved daniel surely he loved job surely he loves you twice more he says it he says it three times as a vindication that heaven loves daniel he said oh man a man greatly beloved understand the words that i speak now unto thee verse 19 oh man greatly beloved fear not so see what the holy spirit's saying heaven loves you understand heaven loves you be strong don't be afraid see that's what love does love tells you don't be afraid love tells you understand this i want you to know this love is is meets all the law love fulfills every commandment praise god love drives out fear loves gives strength love meets every need if we just love god and realize how much he loves us i just thought that was beautiful now you remember the scripture the bible said twice paul calls us dearly beloved here but then he tells us in first corinthians as well therefore my dear brother dearly beloved and long form my joy and crown stand fast in the lord my dearly beloved and i'm not going to really deal with the bickering part of that but again just showing how you and i are dearly beloved heaven loves us praise god heaven loves you and we gotta and we have to stay in more contact with heaven through prayer right prayer without ceasing through worship stay in contact with the heavenly wisdom of god so that means remember your favorite so i'm going to skip past that now getting back to this remember satan is accusing us before god day and night so remember it goes so fast there their days go way way faster than ours right wait wait way faster so satan comes the bible said day and night he and his demons just accuse us before god all the time the bible said the jews overcame him by the blood of the lamb now this is the jews in the heart in the future 144 000 and by the word of their testimony and love not their lives unto death all right so the only way to overcome all satan's accusations is to constantly apply the blood to your life jesus forgive me jesus i'm trusting you that you're forgiving me now i'm confessing my sins it's that simple right sometimes we make it so hard and i think if we made it simpler we'd be happier right we wouldn't all be down and discouraged about god because you know as soon as you confess and you mean it he forgives you i'm overcoming by the blood not by my works i'm overcoming i'm overcoming by the blood amen because the blood washes away all of our sins praise god so day and night in heaven demons constantly coming to accuse us but we overcome by the blood of the lamb praise god our testimony has to be unforgiven i confess that that's under the blood thank god we can say that church i put that under the blood and if you have it now is the time to put under the blood praise god now remember church i want to just show this that the demons behind the human kingdoms remember when jesus was born his tale uh satan drew a third part of the the the demons out of heaven right and cast him to the earth uh the dragon stood before the woman which is mary which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born so it was satan and all of his demons that anointed herod uh to kill all those babies right in other words the battle from heaven came down to earth praise god and we are on the side of the heavenly kingdom praise god right and so we can recognize satan's kingdom by its attributes murder false accusation right all these attributes and so we we are and remember our battle is not against flesh and blood but spiritual wickedness in high places that's right so let's remember that praise god even that's why we can have mercy on our enemies because we know that human it really it's really not there it wasn't their initial thought it was satan's initial thought right it was satan's initial plan it's satan's kingdom we're fighting against and it's god's kingdom that can overcome satan's kingdom amen now just notice this here notice satan's power was behind pharaoh in the days of moses because god said i'm going to pass through egypt smite on the first board and against all the gods that's the demons of egypt i will execute judgment how is he going to do that by killing the firstborn of all these demon-possessed people right how is god going to execute judgment on their gods by making their servants sad right they're taking their firstborn that's how god was going to do it that's how closely sinners are connected to satan's kingdom but what about us we're so closely connected to god's kingdom amen hallelujah see satan's motivating the agenda today right the one world government the vaccines and all these things it's motivating all that one world money one world rome i showed you last week how the pope said it's okay to get the vaccine and the pope says they got to bring all the big companies together and figure out ways to get everybody jobs and money and prosperity the pope satan's behind that see we know that because he's behind all these human kingdoms now you remember this in zechariah satan's uh i'm sorry he showed zechariah joshua the high priest standing before the angel lord satan standing at his right hand to resist him and the lord said to say remember we're still in this heavenly courthouse right the lord said the lord rebuked these saints even the lord had chosen jerusalem rebuked thee is not this a bran plucked out of the fire so like this god called job a perfect man he calls joshua the high priest he's a firebrand amen he's like a stick that keeps the fire going he's that's how hot he is it's like he's living in that fire oh god help us to live in the holy ghost amen but now if you read on he had dirty garments on but i like god because god sees you what you're going to become not what you are right now praise god right he saw david as a king of israel when he's out there singing to the sheep lord is my shepherd he's singing the sheep but god sees him as a mighty king on the throne hallelujah that's what god sees us god sees us differently than we see ourselves amen so we got to remember that god sees us as our potential as his foreknowledge of what we're going to become that's why i don't feel bad when someone calls me a prayer warrior because i really know i'm maybe not yet but i'm going to be praise god i didn't hear you right i may not or someone says oh you're this or that and i know it ain't true right i'm a human but i see well compared to other people in other churches i may be praise god right so we got to take what god's word says about us that god which started a work in us will be faithful to complete it god's gonna finish what he started in your life i could say amen to that for 2020 praise god it's your 20 21 sorry i'm nearby see because remember now look at the heavenly courtroom here paul says the jews judge themselves unworthy of everlasting life because they despise the lamb's testimony always let jesus testimony be on your lips jesus loves me jesus died for me jesus filled me with the holy ghost jesus forgives me praise god jesus heals me praise god amen see if we deny the testimony here it denies it in heaven and then say in has a he has rights to say this person this person does deserve an accusation but as long as we keep our testimony here i am faithful i am a holy ghost field saying i am a prayer warrior praise god i do love the bible i spend time with god amen all these truths praise god we must have the testimony right we must have the testimony of the blood of the lamb god's making me more diligent god's making me a more loving parent god's making me a more faithful worker on the job amen god's helping me understand my gifts praise god amen see judge ourselves by the blood of the lamb we overcome him by the lamb's testimony jesus is working on me he's not done with me yet he gave me a great 20 20 by god's grace he's going to give me an awesome 2021 praise god a year where i can escape evil and have more integrity praise god he's going to make my character more like christ this year remember he's the high priest of your profession he can only do what you profess so what are we professing for 2021 what are we professing tonight god's gonna restore my family god's gonna help me win souls praise god god's gonna do signs miracles and wonders that's my testimony by the blood of who the blood of jesus now once you remember heaven's courtroom the bible says my little children i don't want you to sin if any man said we have a advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous so jesus is our lawyer praise god oh nobody can argue a case like him praise god no one's got knowledge like he does no one's got legal knowledge like he does because he was there praise god at the beginning praise god hallelujah he was the year and he founded the he founded the foundations of the earth praise god before the angels was there he was there praise god he knows all things and he's the propitiation he's the mercy seat for our sins he's the covering for our sins the protection he's our heads hallelujah and the sins of the whole world so see an advocate is like a judge a pleader a counsel for defense a legal assistant an advocate it's okay if you don't got the bible memorized jesus does which have you got the ohio revised code memorized if someone took you to court could you defend yourself absolutely not i say have mercy judge let me get on my phone i'll try to find a quick revised code real quick here oh but if you hired a an attorney oh i could just relax because the attorney is going to speak for me jesus speaks for you the bible said his bread speaks greater things than that of abel praise god not vengeance but mercy forgiveness power strength hallelujah his spirit is speaking for us tonight amen let the lawyer speak mr jesse smith what do you got to say for yourself you're accused of all this jesus go ahead praise god represent me said your honor he's speeding my case today oh the honor the judge is the same one as the the lawyer it's the same one praise god just a different manifestation hallelujah see he's pleading our case tonight arguably glad jesus pleads our case i have representation in heaven right now there's heavenly counsel just real briefly on this god is so humble look god is so humble he shares his power and it makes it look like he wants people's opinions now see if you can't take an opinion from somebody it shows you a lot of pride in your life because even god i said church even god can humble himself and take somebody's opinion now he knows what's the best we don't know the best but you can't take an opinion from your husband or a wife if you can't take opinion from the pastor you are in a prideful position for sure because god is so humble he says uh who'd like to go down there and how could i uh make ahab fall ramos gillian how how could i do that now he knows how but he's so humble he says who would like to go before us anybody got any good ideas out there this one says this this one has that and pretty soon a lying spirit comes up he says i'll go and god says okay i like that one right there look he's so humble so not only does he hear arguments court cases and evidence and all these things now he does he does that but he also he takes uh people's comments and the angel's ideas right because he's so he's so magnificent he's so humble see because all these angels are spirits they're ministers of flaming fire they're all servants to him they've all got to report to him they've all got to obey him praise god they're all limited although they're powerful they're all limited by almighty god now i want you to catch this church this thought came to me today paul caught the mind of the heavenly counsel of god for this brother who was sleeping with his stepmom right because satan cannot touch a hair of someone's head until god says it's okay this was a brother this was someone who was baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ but paul catches the mind i must have been an angel come and tell them amen praise god an angel must have come told go ahead and give this guy over to the satan let satan destroy his body that his soul might be saved in other words paul realized god said take the hedge off this man he won't repent of his sexual immorality take the hedge off him now we know he came back by god's grace right if you read second corinthians he said i'm sorry i made you he said i'm not really i'm sorry i made you sorrowful because it brought you to repentance so god removed the hedge right and let satan just go after him a little bit he says oh forgive me forgive me i'm so sorry he remourned he repented he said i'll never do it again i'll never sleep with my stepmother again and they welcomed him back in the church and then god said okay i'm putting the hedge back down on him now that's a god of love right amen that's a god i want to serve praise the lord you see sometimes church ministers or brothers or sisters will get the mind of god about what's going on in heaven right oh this person needs put out from under the blood that's a heavenly decision because now satan has free reign there's no more hedge on them we have to ask for the mind of christ in this hour i just thought i'd share that with you now i'm going to try to finish up here with this just a little bit more on job's life everybody love the lord now what struck me about job is a few things i like to share and here's what a brother said on that sermon i was listening he lives in north carolina he had some good points he said job was the ultimate christian businessman i thought that was such a good idea because he had all those goats you know the cattle and the sheep five million dollars worth he was such he was such a great businessman and in other words everything invested in huge gains he went to the stock market with a thousand he got a hundred thousand back he hit the jackpot and he kept doing it till he had five million dollars now that's wisdom right there financial wisdom but god bless everything he did everything he tried god blessed it god said he was the most holy man on the earth what a testimony there's none like job church i don't know about you but that's how we should want to be lord let me be the most holy person i can possibly be for your glory that's what paul says paul says don't run the race like you're going to lose he said run it like you're going to win praise god that means if i see myself slacking i see other people more spiritual or they're not stumbling over this but i am then we need to run harder praise you need to lay aside that weight and get some spiritual exercise going praise god see so in god's in god's sight he's now look at this in god's sight he has a he has a way to judge and place people by by how much they love god how much they hate evil and he knows who's number one on the spot oh that's what jesus that's a remember uh john and andrew's mom said oh we can can my son sit on your right hand left hand see there's a place for somebody there god knows who's gonna be on that right hand god knows who's gonna be in the left hand because god's keeping track of those who hate evil who love holiness praise god and that's how you gain that seat it's a reward of course the most humble people will be there but god looked at all the old testament saints he said there's job he's the high he's number one he's about he's more spiritual than all of them he doesn't let anything come on his phone he don't look at anything on his phone that shouldn't be on there praise god he doesn't gossip one thing about his sister brother not one and little little thing he did he went repented of it right because he's he's still a sinner saved by grace so god has a ranking a system in heaven like the bible said cornelius's prayers are recorded in heaven there's vials there's bowls there's bowls i shouldn't preach on this because i'll get spit in there but there's bowls that are filled up with prayers and almsgiving and god knows which one has the most right but if they do it god knows though if they do it just to be seen of men there's no heavenly it doesn't get filled up in heaven it's those that do it in secret that the lord rewards openly so what do you consider the most spiritual person today just like job he fears god he's perfect he's upright and he hates evil the most perfect man you could think of we look at arnold schwarzenegger he's like oh that's the perfect man that's not the permanent man he might be perfectly symmetrical in his muscles where he was but that's nothing it's whose heart is right before god whose life speaks of jesus jesus jesus jesus you know he's the most prosperous man he had the most beautiful family right he had loving servants he's a man of worship i love this that's what the one of the things the preacher said he didn't take his salvation of his children for granted he was so spiritual he didn't just say well you know my children are all older and moved out and i'm sure they're serving god he didn't he didn't you know they didn't have cell phones they couldn't talk and see how they're doing right so he said since i don't know i'm going to go to church more and i'm going to give more sacrifices i'm going to pray more for my children just in case they backslide i'm not going to take it for granted what i taught them in other words i'm not going to stop caring for my children i'm not going to stop praying for my dad or mom i'm going to keep praying offering spiritual sacrifices unto god because because if they backslide they'll have prayers there before the throne of god asking for mercy amen hallelujah what made him so holy he had eternal life he was living for others on his day off in his free time he made extra prayers for his children god help us to do that church that's why people get backside and call on god they stop doing any sacrifices to god they just get lazy and they just come to church and then god is just gonna keep blessing them if they just come to church well you gotta do more you gotta sacrifice more than just come to church you gotta exercise more than just in church praise god and i know i preach a hard sanctified holy ghost-filled message but that's how i want to live praise god amen i'm not perfect but that's how i want to live hallelujah now job's battle was with himself and then with a bunch of carnal believers a bunch of message believers that wanted to degrade him and accuse him and even even his sweet lovely wife she was she was carnal she got in the flesh and said just curse god and get it over just die and say there's no god i remember god had mercy on her she and eventually had 10 more children after that my brother makes it say that god brought those 10 back from the dead it might be but i think when i read it it looks like he had just had 10 or 10 10 new ones that's what it looks like to me but i don't it could have been a miracle too that'd been quite a miracle but our god is great our god could have done that was he his battle battle was with met with people that used to trust him around the message but when he went through trials they all attacked him like see you're wrong you're wrong you're wrong you're wrong it's your fault you got secret sin that was the thing right you're hiding something the reason you're suffering is because you're hiding something but what did god say god said he's perfect praise god amen praise god see see church you and i should know the condition of our hearts if our hearts condemn us not amen even if other people condemn us we should be able to know the condition of our heart whether that's true or false and if it's false then say god give us strength i know i'm in the right help me to endure the fire then i'll come forth stronger and more pure help me to endure the fire praise god i'll say i just stand with me in the fire like shadrach meshach and abednego jesus come stand with me it's getting kind of hot all right come stand with me in the fire hallelujah george that's many times with our battles with carnal believers people that say they believe the message people that used to look up to us but now they criticize us they used to consider you a very spiritual and you might have been the messengers longer than them but now they criticize you well job had to stand before job had to stand up against that and so will we sometimes but don't be discouraged let your love for holiness let let your let let your character speak praise god don't argue back don't fuss let your character speak louder than your words now church just get your bible here let's just read this real quick job was such a sanctified saint go to job 29 here i'm not even sure how long i've been preaching uh maybe about an hour here anybody keep track honey did you keep checking you see when i started okay let me set a 15 minute timer i'll try to i just feel like preaching a long time tonight so i try not to but uh i feel like it just so stirred up by what god is doing the holy spirit's moving praise god job 29 13. i love how he does it he says in the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established now look how job is he wasn't even living for himself really he was living for others 29 12 because i delivered the poor that cried and the fatherless and him that had none to help him so this is a guy that helped out the kids who had no dad people that would cry for food he'd go help him out verse 13 the blessing of him that was ready to perish came up upon me and i caused the widow's heart to sing for joy so widows that had no husband they had no food no money he would bring food and they'd shout hallelujah praise yahweh thank you jehovah jairo praise god he'd seen that he'd seen people rejoice oh god used me to help a poor person hallelujah thank you jesus this wasn't some make-believer church this is a man of god see now go down to uh let's do the next one here 31 chapter 31 24 25. see job talks you know this is i can't get through all of it but job talks here he's listening to his three friends uh and he says one more thing before elihu comes out barbara said that's a perfect type of christ elijah is a perfect type of christ 31 24 he says if i have made gold my hope or have said to mine gold thou art my confidence if i rejoice because my health was great and because my hand had gotten much now look at that even though he had five million dollars he didn't like rejoice when he saw that on his bank account i got five million we might take a screenshot i got that much money i can't believe it joe he's just like well praise the lord i'll keep doing what i'm doing i'll keep helping the widow i'll keep helping the poor i'll keep feeding this man i'll feed the poor god love this man job he said look he's a perfect man he didn't let his he linda let his bank account become his confidence he let jesus be his confidence we'll say like that for us verse 30 now verse 29 if i rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me or lifted up myself when i when evil found him he even loved his enemies he felt sorry when his enemies had hard times he didn't curse his enemies praise god he blessed those who cursed him praise god it's a real man of god and verse 30 uh no that was it right yeah he loved it yeah verse 32. that's right the stranger did not lodge in the street but i opened my door so wow he had like a hotel in his house he didn't let the stranger go sleep on the street he took that money church and he used it he built himself a little hotel whenever somebody needs it they can have a hotel just giving you some idea is this a godly man or not godly man he overcame essential mind battles about pretty women look at verse chapter 31 verse 1 i made a covenant with mine eyes why then should i look what should i think upon and made look at verses nine and ten if my heart have deceived me by a woman or if i've laid weight at my neighbor's door see if i was flirting with the neighbor's wife then let my wife grind another and let others bow down upon her he said that i haven't done any of this i kept my mind right i kept my mind on god not on my money that's what the world does they put their mind on their money and their money on their mind right see this man was full of god's love this man was dedicated to the scripture this man loved holiness praise god this man was blessed this man was fruitful this man was prosperous he was sanctified but memory could not be filled to the holy ghost saints he must have been so up there right he must be right at the border line of brotherly kindness like almost ready to get to the top of that cup he was so close up there look at this do you see any fault in him not much this is the kind of man that god looks down and says that's a man that's a perfect man now don't raise your hands but how many think they could live closer to god after hearing that now i want to um i think i'll get back to this one here let's go down a little bit here this is uh i preached this recently but uh see now we know god saw job as perfect but it's possible remember brother branson said it's possible job's sin helped cause this trial right it's possible because what did job say job said in chapter three this is after he said the lord gives the lord takes away this is when he starts having mind battles this is when he starts cursing the very day he was born oh i wish my birthday was off the calendar i don't like when people celebrate my birthday but it's nice to see that i had a birthday praise god and i like to tell people tell me they love me who doesn't like to hear that but but job's like i cursed that calendar wish i never would have been born and he said the thing which i greatly feared is come upon me and that which i was afraid of has come unto me i was not in safety neither had i rest neither was i quiet yet trouble came look at this church job was faithful with all these things but in the back of his mind he had a battle with fear that he was going to lose everything so see part of his motivation was i better fear god because i might lose it all i'm scared i'm scared everything i work for i might lose it he was scared how many can relate to that oh look what god's given me god give me this home god give me this car god give me this family i don't want to lose it i can say amen to that i don't want to lose it but job said i greatly fear not this is not a little fear problem church this was a big fear problem are you with me tonight this is his own words i had a great fear mind battle and yet the god said god looks down and says that's a perfect man see god doesn't hold against your mind battles raise god hallelujah you now listen you'll have to suffer the consequences of your mind battles if you lose them right just like here you might have to suffer some consequences but heaven still sees you as perfect why because you're under the blood why was joe perfect because he was under the blood sacrifice brother ram said he met god's requirement amen what was god's requirement to bring a lamb praise god to bring a buddha to cover your sins and when he did that although he had the mind battle and it may have caused it god forgave him and said he's a perfect man he's trusting in my covenant he's keeping my words he's putting his sins under the blood let's do the same thing tonight praise god he wasn't perfect by his works although he had some really good works i'd put his life up against any brother i know in the message look at that list i just read who do you know that's done that well hopefully you don't because they kept it in secret right right i think i told you when simon was here simon i'd say would probably be the closest one that i know because i have the most contact with him i don't have the most contact with all of you you do things in secret but i have a lot of i have a lot of friends that know simon and then i hear some things he does so to me i'm not trying to exalt people but just understand like sometimes your works are done in secret but sometimes you can't hide them and you're like a city on a hill that cannot be hidden so church if you're really doing good all the time people are going to see it sometimes if that widow shot him for joy said hallelujah thank you joe don't you think the neighbors would have heard it i made the widow to joy and shout and praise the lord i got food and oh i got all these things and she shouts for joy somebody there's a lot echo in here i hope heaven's not going to i hope i'm echoing heaven praise god amen that's what i hope by god's grace that the lord wants me to say these things i hope you're being blessed tonight by god's grace see he didn't have a little fear problem church he had a great fear problem same thing we all battle right same thing we're all about them fear great fear and remember what brother brown said brother brahm said if he would what hap what brought his test brother bam said fear brought it we make it seem like job never sinned he did sin he had a fear problem right and it's possible this fear that he didn't take care of caused this to come upon him but let me say this did god deliver him from his fear yes absolutely did god overcome his fear problem oh yeah is god going to help you overcome your pride problem is god going to help you overcome your lust problem is god going to help you overcome your doubt problem your unbelief problem absolutely praise god if you're a child of god he will perfect that which concerneth you that's what david wrote david said i know god is going to perfect all these things that concern me in other words everything in my life everything that's concerning me god is going to use that to help me love it more and bring me into a perfection of a believer to help me reach my god-given potential he'll perfect that which concerns me see his fear brought it on him he was scared it was going to happen and it did happen see what i mean so see we can't exact job and say he never sinned he had to have sinned because he's under the blood of bulls and goats he says if you're afraid when you come into the prayer line he says it won't happen right so we got to have faith he said if you have a fear your disease is going to leave you it won't leave you if you have faith it will and the church said now let me go back here let me go back a little bit and i'm gonna close with this i set a timer i got uh four minutes can you bear with me four more minutes thank you now i'll probably preach on this maybe a little more sunday by god's grace but i just want to hit these uh main highlights here now this is what the saints really rejoiced over in uh uh napoleon maybe i preached it here before but i just want to remind you church that your soul is perfect in heaven heaven sees you as perfect right because it sees you as a complete person right it sees your finished state like joshua the high priest like job praise god god sees you as your completed product right right but we will battle imperfect flesh and mind on the earth right now look in the same letter look at this brother bank that struck me today i didn't see this before in the same letter he says if we confess our sins we're forgiven right we're familiar with that if we say we've not sinned we make him a liar so john starts off the book by saying if you don't if you if you don't admit your sin you're a liar but then in chapter 3 he says whoever's born of god does not commit sin for his seed remains him and he cannot sin well which one is it am i a sinner or i do not sin it's bold praise god amen i sin in my flesh and mine but in my soul i cannot sin because god's nature lives in my soul my soul is god's nature it's a part of god amen that's why god could look down at job and say he's a perfect man yet he had fear problems right yet he worried about the future what's going to happen am i going to lose my job am i going to lose my kids which is normal but god could look and say satan ever seen a perfect man like that he's looking at his son see god's got confidence in your church god's got confidence you you're going to overcome satan hey come on somebody break up put on the armor of god and you overcome satan hallelujah put all the armor of god you overcome him he's got confidence because he he's the one that made all those weapons and armor pieces praise god he gave you just what you needed to overcome satan praise god you are not just partial conqueror you're more than a conqueror praise god hallelujah come on somebody we ought to be rejoicing in here tonight praise god he give you the armor give you the sword they give you the word he gives you a perfect soul that's always right before god we ought to rejoice in that praise god thank you jesus christ praise god hallelujah it helps me i know it helps you too so in closing let's read these from your body get your bible here colossians 2 13. job was perfect in god's sight by the blood sacrifice just like we are but yet church we've still got to deal with consequences colossians 2 13. in my prayer holy spirit write these scriptures upon our hearts if you have any condemnation in our hearts holy spirit write these scriptures upon the fleshy tables of our hearts and you being dead in your sins in uncircumcision of your flesh at the quicken together with him having forgiven you all trespasses all of it church not part of it not some of it all of it's under the blood all of it's forgiven amen praise god he's forgiven you all your wrongs when you when you did what you knew you should not have done he's still forgiven that praise god he's forgiven your iniquities praise god for giving you all your trespasses romans 8 1-2 i want us to start 20 21 knowing that god sees us as perfect in heaven praise god amen and that we can learn to escape evil and we can live so close to god i know you praise god that god will be bragging on us in heaven not that we want god though you know god wouldn't do it in any bad way but not that we're trying we're not we're not doing it just to be bragged on we're doing it because we love holiness and we're so grateful for the blood of jesus christ romans 8 1-2 this remember he goes through all the sins in the first seven chapters how we're all sinned we all gotta answer before god we're there's none righteous no not one and then now in chapter eight he gets into how a person walks in the baptism of the holy ghost there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in

together for good to them that love the lord to love god to them who are called according to his purpose he says what shall we say to these things in verse 31 if god be for us who can be against us i
