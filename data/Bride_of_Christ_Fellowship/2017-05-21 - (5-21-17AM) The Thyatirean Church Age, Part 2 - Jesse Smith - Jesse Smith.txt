[Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] to read verses 18 and 19 grace of God have to greet everybody the name Lord is good to see I sure missed everybody last Sunday not sure like meeting in Lima bye sure miss being home to by God's grace I miss I miss hope it was like a homecoming you know because I was baptized in Lima you know he might heard the message in Lima was married at Lima but he was dedicated at Lima it was like a homecoming - I sure missed being here with all of you we had just a tremendous time of worship and fellowship it was a great time in the Lord and I don't know if you heard on Wednesday if you livestream but I told some of the testimonies that's one of the testimonies there last week but I'm sure hope you enjoyed the service here with both Simon last week he's in Cambodia so as we said earlier just keep them in prayer do a missionary work there by God's grace Revelation chapter 2 verse 18 19 this is part 2 of a Thyatira in church age and as I've said before is to go through this never let just the theme or the topic of the church age is kind of lull you to sleep or don't get bored just as you know it's going to be a church age there's so much of this that applies to us right now and because you know if you're a Christian then let's serve and God enough your life goes through like a church age it does it goes through like a church age it really does and to see how Christ and you can relate with what no matter the trials that each church age was in you and I can relate to it whether it's persecution whether it's famine or whatever it is you know whatever whatever need there is we can relate to that it applies to us and so we could gain courage and strength we can hear the voice of the Holy Spirit if we're just a sincere enough to listen I say like that amen Revelation chapter 2 18 and 19 praise God I'll read verse 18 that's already 90s already 18 by myself and unto the Angel of the church in Thyatira write these things saith the Son of God who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass let's read 19 together out loud if you can one two three I know that I works and charity and service and may and thy patience and thy works and alas to be more than the first Amen I mean on your hearts make it a little more let's bow our heads here as we pray Heavenly Father we read your word you're the only one Lord that can break the word to the people any man or woman can read the scripture but father let the holy spirit break this word to your people Lord God strengthen us this morning encourage us Lord keep us Lord in the faith Lord keep us walking on the street in their way we're the most deceptive age there ever was Lord God let us not be deceived about our spiritual condition I'll be that's the burden for this message this morning dear god help us to clearly see where we stand dear God it helped me to be a vessel meat for the Masters use use me Lord God man I take my mind let me take your mind let the people's mind be your mind Lord let us receive from heaven this morning no doubt as prayers have gone forth dear God for this service Lord God speak to us Lord this morning as you open the service with speak my Lord and we'll be quick to answer thee dear God we love you Jesus minister not each and every person that's our visitor by the the father Minister by the holy spear in Jesus Christ the church said a message being seen praise God I like to again occasion show quotes you know by God's grace as I cannot you have to promote put it on the peace thank you so we'll start here we'll get our to this morning and appreciate the Lord this morning amen it's good to see everybody getting sure this to everybody you know when's I don't let a preach on a little message I just want to start with that the message called the Holy Ghost is timid and I will kind of want to bring that back just to remind the church oh how sensitive we have to be to the Holy Spirit I don't know if you saw that I want to encourage the church if you're not able to livestream those services try and listen to it on Thursday or Friday or Saturday because if you miss out on a service you kind of missed the direction of the Holy Spirit never understand that like if you're a sheep okay let's say you miss a meal from the Shepherd you know you're going to be little disconnected you know and if we want to be connected as a body try to feasts on every word that you can because it ain't me mode absence you've got to look beyond the preacher we've got to see Christ in the word amen so if you haven't listened to Wednesday night I encourage you to do that it'll help you by God's grace we looked at a lot how young he sends it to the Holy Spirit but God could move you know in the atmosphere if we made it right with God and serve God and basically ended up with word to the church brother Brandon left us above all he said love one another he said Satan's gonna he said you have a honeymoon as a church a honeymoon period as a church right and then he said but say he's not gonna let it remain that way he said he's going to inject somebody with poison to test the church God's get allowed to test the church and he said when that poison comes and somebody gets need and I starts talking bad about somebody or something like that he said don't join up with them but rally together as body in love they met and so I just thought it'd be good you know and I kind of shared how I felt like I can see as a pastor I'm here every service I can see as a pastor how we had a honeymoon period the last few years but then Satan's trying to inject some poison into the church so I understand that like you see people come in and then fall out or come in and fall out you know they they can't remain faithful why is that because they don't have the Spirit of God in their hearts right the right church but man said he said I'll tell you he said if you got the Spirit of God your heart you can't wait for those doors to open and fellowship with your brothers and sisters glory that's a big if if you've got the Spirit of God anointing you your heart you see what people feed the black dog the black dog the black dog and they don't to come feed the white dog because they're so same to get them discouraged or depressed or something like that but if you've got the Spirit of God in you you can't wait to see your brothers and sisters because you're gonna spend eternity with them amen it's exactly right holiday be there so if you didn't listen to that please get a chance to listen make that up make that a priority put God's word above work family anything put God's Word and watch of God don't bless you program says put God first he said pay your tithe first he said above all put the house of God about everything else in your life I've preached on that couple years ago you know you want the quote I'm kidding I can click it in seventy in two clicks by God's grace if you want those quotes because we're going to get as much out of the holy spirit as we put into this let me understand that you have to invest in it if you invest in you'll get something up remember Galatians 6 said if you sow to the flesh so if you invest in your flesh you're gonna reap to the flesh but if you invest in the holy spirit you're going to reap in the Holy Spirit Lord why not have it enough reaping of the Spirit will have you invested in lately how come my crop the Holy Spirit is not coming up well have you planted there have you eat at the garden lately right so we want to we want to remember that and now the reason I often preach on church attendance and support in church is because of the prophecy of Joel toups let's turn in your Bible Joel 2:23 I'll put up here on Maya computer junk doctor my bug laughter Joel 2:23 brother Brad said this is thus saith the Lord Joel chapter 2 23 for the bride thus saith the Lord so the in other words this is the direction we're going and that's why Vernon's me as a pastor when I know what brother Bram said about the state the Lord and people aren't all again my joy and burdens me I've got I've got a responsibility to warn the people I understand that I want to preach I'm not going up up and study on that warnings and the watch straight from the watchtower from Ezekiel Oh Matt hallelujah brother have said this is thus saith the Lord to the bride be glad that insures I rejoices the Lord your God we're supposed to be glad and rejoice in God he free have given you the former right modely that's the ministry for the brand of teaching ministry and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter in the first month so it's fall dated in the latter ad tells us his raptured thing so we're going to be receiving the former rain the teaching a program through the Bible we're receiving that the anointing of lessons of that but one day the latter rain is going to start phone that's going to be rapture afraid to get the bride ready exactly and here and the for show be full of wheat what does we do it makes you read which is the word which is the food of God amen and the bat shall overflow with light and oil so see the church is supposed to have this we're supposed to have a house that's filled with oil and why and wheat I understand that man so people don't want to come to the house of God how the word you going to make a rapture when it's tough state the Lord we got to have plenty of we D plenty of wine plenty of oil plenty of simulation we got to be glad we got to rejoice that's the prophecy that's the vision for the church you'll never understand that that's thus saith the Lord for the RAM toes so if we're not in love with the Church of the Word of God something's wrong with us we're not walking in step we're not walking in a prophecy that the Prophet gave us you can say all day long guess I'll be alone I believe my dad was a prophet I believe every word he said Oh superb Oh Benson a man tornament I believe every word you say brother Mannis knew he was lying my vision and program said see that's a spirit a spirit gets on something I believe all the messenger I believe this and if their life does it all line with that obedience they don't believe it they're just a professor and not a possessor exactly right and here are the next two verses and I'll restore to you the years of the locust has eaten see all these in years these denominational and Antichrist spirits and either way God's going to restore God's going to restore the love that they had on the day of Pentecost for the man God is going to restore that to us I'll just it's the save the Lord brother Graham said might a great army which I sent him on you numbers 2016 he shouting him plenty who's this more of the bride what Aram said this is for the bride they'll say the Lord you shall eat in plenty strap plenty of food to eat we're going to be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that I've dealt wonders with you of my people should never be ashamed that's the save the Lord how we can see that by God's grace so when I see people you know their characters lacking or if their desire is not lacking for the things of God what if what should i do what should you do we should reach out love and try to encourage people and pray for that right the Bible said let the strong encourage the weak that's the scripture first Thessalonians chapter 5 so this is a vision without a vision you're going to perish do the opposite without a vision the people perish vision means prophecy well here's the prophecy the bride is supposed to walk into without this you're going to perish it's exactly right you must have the vision Lord you're going to restore Lord we're going to eat we're eating in plenty we're enjoying a former rain I'm enjoying the rain showers of the teachings from the Bible that God sent through His Prophet I rather enjoyed that arranged of our main man events that rain that shower we'd say the showering blessings of the Holy Spirit and this is what I preached last Sunday in Lima I preached for to enact two hours people were just pulling I lost my voice is you probably to that I never get back into any more is I'm so busy everything preaching talking teaching all the time at the end of the service for the young a couple people come up I went over to pray over the young man a 14 year old man he's confessing his sins and just prayed for him at different sins I told him gave him counsel and he's shaking in crime he's raising his hands as he's getting the victory pray for my 10 or 15 minutes hey finally broke through he's finally able to raise his hands and rejoice he's got tears and we're both shaking and crying as soon as he did that a sister let out a scream praising God and after I got no brain with him some of the vegan shoulders there go Jessica sister on a prayer so I walked over and said sister Deanie prayer she said God already healed me while you were praying for that man the same time God was dealing with that man giving him victory the Holy Spirit held that man - how did it even the power of the Holy Spirit amen my dad said if you don't all line with it we'll move on to somebody else but I'm going to say this pass me down oh gentle Savior hear my humble cry while others are calling don't pass me by touch me today bless me today because we're in a time where as this is where we're getting to venture out into the service love of the people is going to wax old the love is going to decrease the foolish virgins love is going to get less and less the world's love for God is going to be less less but ours should increase understand men we should have plenty of love plenty of word plenty of widen oil we should have plenty of it our lives should be full of love and full of inspiration full of the Holy Spirit you believe that that's what your prophet said thus saith the Lord that's what my prophet said so see that's why I'm trying to walk in line with that I want a long walk in line with that I hope you do by the grace of the Lord about such a burden you know when I see these things how can you be walking the vision and not coming to church or not read your Bible or any like got to and the Bible says the bride is going to do that she's going to fall more in love should have more victory should have more joy more enjoy the word more enjoy that's prophecy and want to fall under the spirit of the prophecy that's my little sermon out before the sermon okay so pardon me all right we're in the church ages we're at this age right here the poor church age Thyatira we preach quite a few sermons on these by God's grace and quite a few leading up to them but here where this church age the longest church age 914 years by God's grace now remember each church age had to deal with the satanic power of the Antichrist so God had to send the light anointing to combat the innocent deception of those first years there where the white horse rider was writing when transcend the Satan jumped off his white horse and got on the bloody red when he United powers in the Church of state around three hundred fifty eighty something like that and then he rode for a long time until the Dark Ages and then they started to charging for forgiveness in the Catholic Church started doing novenas and all these things and indulgences and all these things and they captured the wealth of the world and they wrote that black horse rider wrote for quite a long time and now spiritual death is riding understand that spiritual death is riding where people can say they love God but their spiritual debt they can go to church but they're dead while they're alive it's exactly right but thank God we got to fly eagle anointing in the South amen to fly above all those things less or to savage cause I'm gonna dig with my wife grab the part you know walk around how many bows leave a day divided even after you America believe that you have to I still have the most post last night I was on my walk with my wife on a day two Saturdays ago we're just at the Silver Lake Creek II know it's beautiful little uh what you called hard there here sorry in the Norton and I'm just looking around you know were just leaning around watching the beauty of nature all of a sudden I saw eagle swooped down from the heavens he's got this big white head he's kind of hovering there he's probably 20 feet above the water and all of a sudden he just puts his head down and dives right in for the lay down my life in the world he died about how you don't see him for a second and all of a sudden he comes up off the water you got a big old fish in his hand it was awesome and then today he started flying around the lake and pretty soon he just stopped his wings and the the wind currents he caught the wind currents like a whirlwind almost hey going higher and higher and higher and he just got pwned on that fish and I thought my he just had to flap a few times and just like mother Graham said when he see those Eagles they would fly and pretty soon my wife and I watched him and pretty soon we could even see him anymore I thought what a picture of a real child of God jesus said where the carcass is the Eagles would be gathered the eagle knows how to fight its food we know how to find our food in the Word of God we dropped out from the heavenlies to get some food and we let the Holy Spirit to strengthen us to rise above the things of the world so high at the world people on the ground can't even see us because we're in such heavenly places they met and what do we got we got the food of God in our claws a men and with that we'll feed ourselves and our families hallelujah we just make a quick trip down get the food that we need that we saw back up to the heavenlies I mean love the Lord Amen praise God and cap it off yet a guy visit our Bible club at school on Sunday Friday after school and he taught on Eagles I thought Lord you're trying to tell me something to be a flying eagle he said he has an eagle nest four miles from his house here in Ohio that's all he does is take pictures I said you got to come to my class and teach a science lesson on eagles he can be a guest in my class I'm sure I sure want to do that Church I shown to be a flying eagle amen how many would say Lord read reading my strengths like an eagle and these guys sometimes they're really strong sometimes Eagles got to have their strength renewed amen now remember these revelations in the seals and the church ages are the state the Lord I'm not going to go through this within the 7th seal he says this the church age is busted history it's the state the Lord so we're out dealing with some of these ideas these are the revelations God one in its proper to give us amen there's the course for church ages now remember I'm we're looking here at Columbus Church age we went through Colombo last time now 30 Wednesdays ago and I want you to understand this it--it era was the darkest age our age is not the darkest age never understand that our age is the most deceptive age program I have hopes to show I'm not making this up I'm not I'm just telling what the prophets there's less something can see there's less light entirety or than Lucia because of the evening time did shall be light this was the darkest time for the random set because of persecution but the hardest thing about today it's more deceptive even than it was then it's dark for persecution but here it's evil because of deception so that's what the quotes tell us higher-tier was the darkest age but our age is the most deceptive age so you and I have to worry so much about persecution although Christians do different countries and we know there's a coming persecution milligram says some say to the Lord the same persecution on pagan Rome is coming to 96 he says that state the look it's come we know that but right now it's not and it won't be here when the bride's here I don't understand that God will not let his bride you persecuted what man whatever that is might be persecuted you wouldn't do that he protect her so brother it says in Messiah the church age has been through the darkest age it went through the dark ages the church age book we'll get to this in love it I know thy works the last thing more than first now as we've already stated this age is called the dark ages because it was indeed the darkest period of all history see this is darker it was darker than later cm y Bo Jess well he does us it was the age of hope is to the third who claimed that he was the Vicar of Christ supreme sovereign over the church in the world who instituted the Inquisition which under his direction shed more blood than any other time except in the Reformation so what dark means is dark persecution death physical death okay but then if I'm going to tell something out of the île age he said last week of Matthew 24 it was the most deceiving of all ages so fire tear was the darkest age of persecution but our age is the most deception there was in that all the ages of the seed from the garden being all the way down there's never been an age so deceptive as this age so it wasn't as the days of Columba and Thyatira because the real believers knew of their the Roman Catholic Church is perverted you know they're they're killing people you know they got Inquisition on their there wasn't much deception but program tells us now the deception is people will go to church and think of their Christians when they're not and think they're worshipping God when they're actually worshipping Satan but madam said that's more deception today such I pray God take any scales from eyes hoping to see my spiritual condition perfectly so I know exactly where I stand with me don't let me be to see let me look at the word romance at IU how can you ever know that you're doing the will of God and look at the word and do it glory do the Word of God hallelujah were the most deceptive age there ever was this seems people well people to believe they they believe they they believe the message they believe they're follow the message what they're not praise God they believe that God sent a prophet so they say but they don't listen to the Prophet that's right this is the age we're talking about an age of deception praise God remember that was one of them that was one of the Christ the Holy Spirit and the latest in church aid remember as many as I love I rebuke and chasten if he loves you he'll correct you I understand that a man if a pastor loves you a brand new word to correct you I know it's hard because I need correction to many times I know it's hard but if somebody actually loves you they'll try to correct you remember a proverb says if you rebuke a wise man you love you remember that that's ternary but I want to read it I think I'm going to hold up you're up a few clips I think it's reviewed a wise man I think I lived up a few weeks ago yeah there's gory yeah even highlight it okay Gloria rotters 98 rebuke not ask order less he hate the rebuke a wise man and you love thee give instruction to a wise man about God's a wise virgin kind insert that in there ah a wise version filth only goes give instructions to a wise virgin and he or she will be yet wiser teach a just man no increase in learning anyone that doesn't want to be corrected has officially backslidden right amen and if not it doesn't correct that situation will be at most a foolish version but a live version can be corrected and will love you for correcting them praise God don't forget that church if you're the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and now to the whole youth understanding we live in an age where zone wants to be corrected right what's the time they don't to be corrected just tell me good things just tickle my ears as Paul told Timothy that's what they would say just tickle my ears you know but don't correct me but if you correct somebody with wrote godly love they'll receive it because they know you love them it's exactly right hard to find that all right now just so you know there's fire to your the for church Jake that's making that pyramid looks like looks like that cloud picture like I said I brother Brandon saw the cloud of Jesus it sure looks like that looks like a little lick of fire there you know I don't know it's interesting now we did the salutation a couple weeks ago or do the eulogy this morning by the grace of the Lord verse 19 I know that works so see the introduction the citation was verse 18 we preach on that verse 19 I know that it works and love and service and faith in our nations and their works and the last to be more than the first here we get by the same introductory marks I know thy works the son of God Himself said believe me for the very works sake he put an emphasis on his own works while on earth the works that he did were aimed of God to inspire faith in him it was the great part of his ministry amen His Holy Spirit in the Apostle Paul said for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath ordained that should walk in them and we know this but let me say it again God has something good for you to do how many can say men to that you're not supposed to just come to church or for those that sit at home you're not supposed to sit at home and do nothing you're supposed to have a work that God has called you to the administered he said if you're a farmer he said then you'd be the best godly farmer you can do got work to do your father be the best father mother be the best mother housewife whatever you are be the best that you can for Christ amen you have a work you have to do how do you want to do the works of God you only do that by the Holy Spirit because the fruit of the Spirit are the works of the Spirit praise God amen these works were to inspire faith in him as they would show for that relationship to him that Paul describes has created in him amen now rotate of balances out works in faith here as you know if you've ever listened to works as faith Express I preached a whole circle serie of sermons on that sermon from 1965 but let's go over to get works will never take the place of faith in God for our salvation but works will show forth our faith already placed in him good works won't save you but they will come forth out of a save life as fruit unto the Lord I believe in good words even if a man is not saved you ought to do good works and do the best he can but it's horrible the side of God is fermented and evil works and then say they're doing the will of God that is what the bishops and Pope's of hierarchy of Rome are doing they were killing maiming and doing all manner of evil in the name of the Lord right they lived out lives now he's talking about these priests and Cardinals they're posed during the times here in church age they lived out their lives exactly opposite to what the word teaches and that evil day goes shoe believers shone like a light in a dark place as they continually did good for they returned cursing with blessing and did the true to under God even though many died for it they met in this verse which is verse 19 he is commanding his children because they were living changed lives amen their works testified to a new spirit within men saw their good works and glorify God yes sir if you are Christian you are going to do what is right your works will show that your heart is right and it won't be something that you put on for you will do his will like this even when no one but God sees you and you'll do it feel even if it costs you your life a man hey man that's why we have to be careful what are we doing in our free time when no one else is around that's when you'll see the real Jesse or the real vain or the real brother sister saw it so when those around because at that time either you recognize God's presence or you'll forget God's presence and what man said you won't do things that you might do it when you're in God's presence so the thing to do is recognize God's presence status presence and even do what just through the right things of God no matter who's around when you're in secret praise God jesus said thine alms shall be in secret and thy father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly Jesus sees you while you're driving the word all by yourself he sees you praise God he sees you on your note the restroom you don't brushing your teeth or doing your hair good morning when you're all by yourself he sees what you're doing free sky and here he sees it forgiving to the people that are less fortunate than us are we giving to them he sees what's done in secret went out Brandis not shalt not be as the hypocrites are if they love to pray standing the synagogues and the corners of the streets that they may be seen a men verily I say to you they have their reward but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou is shut the door pray to the Father which is and see at the father which seeth in secret shall reward the open in men and this is what we're talking about this is planting to the holy spirit when you go in the closet it's like going into your field and planting a you'll great potato eyes you know you know or you know we'd say scattering the lettuce seat you know or whatever plant you late never venture you like it's like planting in there and then God will reward you openly what stunning seeker will be mad at us on the open you'll be able to take from that prayer closet or take from those kidding and you'll be able to produce fruit of the Spirit and then give that to other people praise God they'll see your fruit in your life but see it must be done in secret it must be planted in secret God sees our secret lives how many grateful for that Amen I'm great please there if I make a mistake in secret he's there to correct me amen he's there to put it back to the faith he's there to point me back to repentance he said I pointed back to obedience man because he sees me in secret praise God if you're sincere those are the best times you have in the Lord which is you in the Lord you and the Lord is worse than Jesus knowing that no one's watching you're not going to get any reward for this other than more of his love and that's the only reward we once more Christ under the brakes God remember without as it is I know your love service faith and patience so now he's going to comment on that portion of the scripture you will know that their love is placed between works and service and that is the right place for it because without love our works are not accepted before God and neither is our service how many can say amen to that man I make say lord help me to do works with love in my heart help you to serve you with love in my heart help me not get just give because I know the Bible says it but help me to get with a loving heart amen help me to go to church with love hey help me to not do to the service just because I have to I know it's the Word of God but because I'd love to do it see love needs to be right in between your works and your service needs to be your very heart which is of course your soul is the baptism all the ghosts in your soul the very core of your being needs to be filled with God's love Laurie Paul speaking the Corinthians that without love I had nothing in whatever I do is without profit unless it's done in love now you can see right here that these believers weren't in that Nicolaes in class that it works as a means of salvation or to be or to be admired by men they did their works out of the love of God that was shut up from their hearts by the holy days ahead see you gotta gotta be born again if you're born again the Bible said the love of God is shed in your heart and then when it's in your heart you want to floss other people praise God and that's why you the works that you do that's why you serve the way you do it's because of God's love in your heart amen that love in their hearts was God's love for his own jesus said by this shall all men know that you're my disciples that you have love one for another the pagans who saw the lives of the early Christians that behold how they loved each other John said every one that loveth is born of God amen do you think you think your family says it about you MA they must really love that church cuz they'll go to church and nose skip our family party or something like that amen on the video I'm going to tell my mom that like a Mother's Day mama I love you so much but God taught me to be a pastor I can't come see on Mother's Day and you know what she's fine with that because she raised me to love God the manner she raised me to love God more than I love anything else so no doubt it hurts us a little bit on holidays don't even see my mom or my dad or things like that one thing I'd get to do is I get to do God's will and I get above God more in a head hey man you see that people are look at your life and say ma you must really love that church because you put God's Word but you put those people to church above everybody else hey dad we're going to say that by God's grace everyone that loves is born of God if you can't find something love out somebody you got to pray a little more and spend more that person you'll find something to love about every person that's exactly right Laurie look everywhere everybody ready for a warning for brother Brad everybody ready awarding I want to give a warrant right here for the RAM stops in the midst of the church age and gives a warning it says concerning the last days that because of the abounding of iniquity the love of many will wax cold programs giving us a warning this is for the last days remember Matthew 24 says I'll bring up in just a minute jesus said iniquity but which is sin that people do and they often already know they shouldn't do it understand that iniquity - sin that you know you should do but you do it anyway because of iniquity so that can only apply to pride members are inserted that brightener definitely find people that have heard the message that's what I mean this is the message of the hour because of iniquity the love of many shall wax cold so it's people that have heard the message is people that have heard the truth of the Bible but they choose if you roam anyway and it's because of that iniquity their love for God and their love for people dies down but we have said in the later scene or last age self-love this is the age of selfies right and love for material things will take the place of the true love of God look at that self love love for material things that's a warning don't love yourself and don't love things more than you love other people if you do you have fulfilled the wrong scripture you don't want to fulfill that scripture you don't want your love waxing away 9 you want it growing it and you want your love for our brothers and sisters here you want it to grow and how we see your love by your service one for another how you serve each other how you treat each other it's exactly right we need to guard against the power of sin these last days so many how many can sit under that I can say my that so many are getting so hard instead of more loving they're getting more hard less levy they don't hug you like they used to they don't fellowship with you like the Heathcliff the church said anything I don't get down into your business but this one by the RAM said you said you believe God sent a prophet you want to pastor to preach the message and this is the message a church we all need it we're all the latest in church age we just ought to tighten up on the buckle of truth and live the truth ain't that a minute I kept it up the buckle the armor get the sword out polish off the shield and be a real Christian soldiering that in men hallelujah people are getting so hard instead of instead of getting it hot for Christ to fold up they're getting icy cold towards love for other people all they think about is themselves it's exactly right instead of serving others instead of helping out the guy that needs something they'll help out themselves praise the Lord instead of helping out supporting the church they'll help out themselves understand what we're talking about it's all about them it's all about me it's about us they love material things and themselves more they love God that is the warning that we need for this hour we should chew on that for a few minutes praise the Lord I will I think I would amen so hard because they hadn't realized the effect of this last day spirit it's time to draw back to God see why I ask people to come to church early and pray you see why I say this because brother Branham said we have to draw not the Bible says for all night and people say they believe in rhythm but don't do what he says amen they don't do it they do some of it but not all of it but the bride does all the Word of God a man she's a full word bride amen everybody thought Judas was in the word all the way but at the enemy show he wasn't but we've got to show everybody that we are as a run all the way all the way through amen amen glory Judas tricked everybody because he had such a false sanctification it looked like he was in the word but he wasn't in the word all the way at the end of the journey is shown what side he was off see instead of getting hard towards others we should get more loving towards others exactly right Church he's trying to draw nigh to God and let him fill our lives of his love or we will feel the coldness of the last day Church and reject the truth of God which alone is able to help us amen so what do you feel when you go here you feel love or do you feel cold well you ought to feel love praise God amen you ought to feel love you shouldn't feel cold and if you feel cold autumn and said go to the person who's cold towards you and talk about how many know he said that well Graham said I have never have any feel any odd feeling toward anybody so go talk to them about it so ultimately it falls back not on somebody else it falls back on each one of us how many can say Amen Milgram said I free something wrong he said come to me in a private meeting straight and straighten me out on that and I said the same thing nobody's come to straighten me out on it so I must be preaching the truth or people are scared to tell me the truth just tell me the truth of overall I'll love you more for that right a wise man if we're wise men and women we should love somebody who's trying to correct us not hate that we should love them grace of God praise the Lord I like that I just want to dwell on that I think I got some scriptures at the end I'm almost done here let me see his most got a few more but so I want to preach tonight okay I got about well okay 11 or 12 more and tonight I'm going to preach on Daniel chapter 8 if you're joined out I hope you'll come tonight over and you can't live stream it it's been a real great series tonight in the prophecy on the last to Gentile power sometimes the Gentiles and there's hope there about the Antichrist to come so if you're interested in that I hope you'll hope you'll tune in that or and be here by God's grace amen I know your service jesus said he that is the greatest of all is servant to all who served more than anybody else in this age brother grant how many could say Monday nobody can have a higher revelation at him nobody can have a greater reward in it because he's a star in Christ's own right hand let me get my hands right this is this he is a literal star that means he shied him brighter than a lot better than me and he's not a guy humming himself he's not just one little tub of abuse Oh God how we should help ourselves I'm the most of the pastor Doug if he's a what could I be if he's if he's a little started I went in the smallest grains broken off the stone a smallest one so who served more than all for the rent where where was mother grave on Sunday in the house of God right where is he where he give his life to mother and said if I need about chores tomorrow 2:00 Monday he said I'd be preaching here on Sunday morning because this is my post of duty hard because they don't want it up there the ones that one it will be here because judgment begins at the house of God a man attacked erupted hey man I feel oh this morning got to serve me up amen that's exactly right a wise man confidence that this here's what he said only history proved the truth of that dictum that man was right all the truly great men of history had been service did you know George Washington anyone to be the general did you know he was planning on retiring instead of being about the general for the revolutionary or did you know that did you know he did not one of these present knighted States he had to choose to sacrifice those years of his life in order to serve that's history he just wanted to go back to his no Virginia home and just he just wonder it retire he already been serving here have been but the people needed a leader Omaha so he sacrificed another decade or so of his life and gave it to the people so they could have a leader and whose name is great today what's the capital our nation who do that who has these monuments its Washington Monument Washington his name is May because he was a servant to all and he was to get paid four hundred thousand a year like somebody's in the past presidents again speech favors $400,000 here just to be a speech after reading president I'm not you know bashing the individuals I'm just saying it's a less of money to them hey then yes they don't have the same character like Washington had a pen another of new and we can't change it at all we just got to bear with them pray for that that's all we can do but you know him and watt Lincoln and all those men Lincoln died to try to unite the army together or the nation did you know that you know that he died who are the greatest men of all those that serve amen those that serve don't think about the body all these people that served think about our day brother branham people that serve that go out there lives could be easier but they purposely get in the service of God to do something for God and they give of themselves he that's greatest among you will be the servant in it exactly right how many want to serve others and that means you have to lose some of your own time and like I said it can be praying for the service at your house be praying here in the church before church it can be given and helping you know with money or open with your time and helping people out Oh your car broke down brother or sister oh maybe we help you out with Saturday maybe we come over help you out or something like that you see they who are great were the servants of all that's right they who demanded to be served they who oppressed they who sought to always get the head have gone down in shame even the very richer condemned by God with him not use their wealth right but look in the history he will find that the truly great ones were those who served others history could never claim those for whom lunch was done but it will forever praise those who did much for others amen like that I wish had more time I wanted that more time to search out more men in history that God has honored but I think you understand those that serve the most those that serve others are the ones who God exalts because they humble themselves then God exalts them in due season so if everyone says let us apply that to ourselves that means let's learn from that help me to learn how to be a sir even as the son of man came not to be ministered but to minister so we are to follow that example see him as he vows himself over the feet of the Apostles and washes their tired and dirty feet he said you do not know what I'm doing but you will know hereafter but what you are seeing me do you ought to do also to others he became a servant in order that God could elevate it to the highest heights and one day in the judgment of the Saints we are to go I'm going to hear him say well done good and faithful servant Jesus said I know your service enter thou into the joy of the Lord is it easy to be a servant Church or is it hard it's hard it's hard to always be a servant other people but those who spend and are spent for others will one day be seated within this throne it'll be worth it all then praise the Lord those who are spend no look life's going to be hard either one way or other either going to get hard for iniquity or you have to have a hard time serving other people rest it with your flesh life is going to be hard Church said aren't you there get hard : God or you have to go the hard way and constantly serve and die out to other people I'll take the way with the Lords of spice in it I'd rather the hard life that way constantly served I am constantly sacrifice let me say this summer is coming up and if you want me to visit your house and fellowship this the time to might be over by God's grace I'm not going to bite by itself over but if you want if you once a mouse with me suffer some time I got to that months so we let me know I'll Drive any distance anybody the church I can do that by God's grace I just wanna make sure I say that so I don't forget you see we must love each other and serve each other by the grace of the Lord program quotes the song we just say let's labor for the master when the roll is called up yonder I'll be there and amen Jesus said I know your faith now he does not say here as he hitted the Church of Pergamos you hope my faith he's not talking about his faith now but he's committing them for their faithfulness and as he does he also mentions their patience now faithfulness that nations go together in fact patience of the outcome of faithfulness or says in James 1 3 the trying of your faith worketh patience now if you would go to Roman's 5 have you got your Bible there I guess I can go there for you about that there's a four-step process to really having godly hope Romans 5:3 so but radically and how you have to work and you have temptations by working you know this because what I've seen the fruit of that you know what we have end-of-the-year benchmarks and first-grade you gotta meet they going to do so many time tests they got that you so good on their reading words per minute I think the guy that would be so good on their reading level and at the beginning the year I have this both the board I put up and said this is where you're going these are the goals you have to read this many words of men you have to write this many sentences you have to do this many facts in eight minutes on the time test and this week we finished all of our tests and I get to enjoy the fruit of my Labor's here we understand that back in August I started planting fruits of helping them become better readers and better writers and better at addition and subtraction and some of the multiplication and division so my first graders time to publication division and I've labored all year you know it's hard sometimes vodka let's go back and help this from the stove and so intervene here let's go back and do it but we kept faithfully working basically and I have patients that some of them church I just think they make the goal but this week I've seen almost everyone did by God's grace now that is just a small example that's just a nine-month planting and harvesting season are you with but I had to be patient good say well Johnny you need to read faster or Susie need to add these better you know you're not a DS the right Layton you're not making it up growth that's just like going out to your garden yelling at your garden tonight when you get home from church you radishes what's wrong with you you celery looks your problem let us what your problem I planted you three weeks ago maybe been wrong or something and I just enjoyed the fruits of my labors this week and I always give up starburst I give the kids all these all right cause I know it's my calls in some cavities but their parents even time to brush their teeth but my teachers gave always gave me our extra rewards I love to do it they've their faces just everybody needs a paycheck you know everybody needs like something summer wore don't think when I was yelling at my grandma gave me $5 for every a I worked my tail off to get straight A's I enjoyed that money I spent on baseball cards and candied apples and all kinds of things I love reading reward and I do it today and help them to see that your works not in vain so this week I saw the fruits of my patients praise God I was patient with Suzy a patient with Lily or patient with this one and that one and they did exceedingly abundantly above all I asked in the new glory amen and see Church that's what we have to do with faithfully with Bryce if we're not there though where we want to be in Christ be patient we got to be patient and keep planning and keep investing and keep believing and be faithful be faithful gardeners be faithful teachers faithful parents faithful pastors faithful deacons faithful song leaders whatever you are be faithful and God will bless you at the end of the road amen it's exactly right great stuff in church they can't exceed me but above all I ask them to do and I don't get to hug them and give them high-fives you know and shake their hands and I believe that's what Jesus was do you know not maybe high five course on high five but it will definitely follow the speed and worship Him a man and a wife away all the tears rise if we're faithful to the end glory did you know did you know the hope of being saved in the rapture four step process I'm waiting for the revelation I would preach to a whole sermon on this the site is struck me when Simon came and preaches a few Wednesday nights ago having how many of us were to be saved I don't have hope to go the rapture it's a four-step process to get that hope it doesn't happen overnight some of you partner when you first came the messenger maybe got tempted to go back to the world it's hard to kind of hope you know use this or not you don't may be able to I want to keep these cigarettes off for me or I'm able to keep this custon away or able to stay away from those movie theaters or I may want to stop doing this or that or this relationship you might not have the hope yet you had but if you serve God long enough and be faithful to God God will give you that blessed hope I understand it's something that doesn't come in a few days it comes after seasons and seasons and years and years of serving God we must be faithful servants we must serve out of love in our heart Satan or and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation works patience so you'll never get patient without going through trials and that patience produces experience I've had the experience of waiting on God and I saw God showing me that situation but I had to go through the trial first or through the trial that increased my patients the patient's led me to have more experience with God and after all of this experience now I've got hope some people I talk to people brother about an sister I thought you people recently that's that I hope I get saved and know the message you heard there hold on how is that possible how can you know this and then not have any hope it's because they're skipping some of these steps praise God like I said last week when the sister said the Holy Spirit struck around preaching I said the problem is people haven't rejected they say they've been baptized it when they were on a drive center right and came up a wet one they never really died themselves because their rice prudent they never have the patience that they never they never get through tribulations like y'all to they fall during tribulations rather Hey they follow the sit rather than coming over sit amet and they never go through this four-step process and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God has shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us amen hallelujah see they don't have any optical erection already hope to go to heaven why because they haven't gone through they haven't evolved through the tribulation then I died themselves they haven't had patience and way not God like they ought to it's a four-step process I'm waiting for the more understand because there's a lot of forms right there's the 419 to the four beasts right Lazarus said it would race on the fourth day there's four Gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John there's a lot of fours out there there's fourth man to fire yeah there's a lot of course I wait for the inspiration on that but it's true if you don't go to the fourth step you won't have hope the Blessed hope for the rapture and that reminds me of another hope army oh this is okay I'm just pull these scriptures up here I think it's actually called the Blessed hope and Titus chapter 2 that's actually talking about the rapture I'm not mistaken yep there's there's okay Titus 2:13 looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of our great God and our Savior Jesus Christ this is what people can't over the rapture they haven't been faithful they haven't served God they haven't really repent of their sin they still love sin more than i truly love God praise God are you joined the word distorted amen I tried to go get him give me a few minutes hear me I want to go too long I go along again I'm going to pass out when I get home from work on these days master Friday I soon got home I said to hi honey Lincoln get out on the floor every since you like you need to go lay on the couch and belts they found so worn out oh my I got out of control myself there is absolutely no other way in which to gain patience it has to come by the trials of movement you have to go through trials you have to wrestle out with God in glory because tribulation worketh patience how highly God regards is out working of our patients and seeing James 1 4 but let patience have a perfect work that you may be perfect and entire lacking nothing God's will for us is perfection and that perfection is patience I love this quote waiting on God and waiting for God glory amen this is the process of character development yet the wait on God and wait for him this is how character is developed tribulation patience gives you experience and experience gives you the blessing whole book you know and your knowing the rapture and if you die you'll meet him in the air how highly God has committed these things of the dark ages patient as lambs led to the slaughter lovingly faithfully they serve God that is all they wanted out of life look at that look at that what is the world 1 they just what pleasures and monies and houses and lands and all these think that's all they went on but all the Christian wants out of life is to serve God hey man hey that's all he wants our life just service to their Lord how great was to be their reward I know how it works in the last to be a more than a person they got close to this in just a moment I I'm not going to get through outer space without wearing myself up I know yeah now look at this laughs works were more than their first so in the church age their works were greater at the end of the church age their works were greater at the end of their life never to understand that by God's grace I remember brother branham's testimony of t/l up not to your mother at that Bosma how do you know that testimony remember that he was a preacher for how many years 30 40 years he was 70 some years old and he was already retired from preaching like he was like a cow going out to pasture you don't even - done he was just done and all of a sudden he heard about the miraculous ministry William Branham and it's so inspired him he left retirement and started preaching and I think it was 75 years old I think in time of Abraham how Abraham got a call 75 50 men amen Lori and Evan Bosworth testimony was that he preached until he died I forget how old he was everybody was it was like 85 or somebody yeah like 10 more years of ministry and his testimony was he did more work at the end of his life than he did the beginning hey Lori and in other words that I would encourage you if you haven't served God up to this point like you've left you you can serve God marks are you done hey Ann Marie it's exactly right or if you've already served got a lot you don't have to say well I can't go any higher you can go higher right ahead amen yes you can hallelujah Jesus says your works are more at the end and that's the beginning praise God why do you think the devil had me to see I couldn't do any more for forgotten heart yes you can there's always more to God if you'll use yourself to the Holy Spirit hey man and what about him say he said when FF Bosworth died he spent the last hours like shaking hands with people in another dimension and they were thanking him for going to preach the gospel at 75 years old 80 years old still preaching the gospel church your life is not in vain you can pick up today and your service at the end can be more at the end it wasn't the begin hallelujah I don't give oh or don't tire it's hard for me to get up earlier it's hard for me like I said hard for me to a lot of things hidden but where myself out but that's no excuse the power of God is able to restore he's the God of restoration I'll restore Sanford a man all the years is prophecy that's what the bride will do all the years of the been lost God will make up for it and short quit work coming on that quota yeah hi there you don't make up for at the end the end will be greater than the beginning a day exactly right the glory of the latter house is prettier than the glory of the harbor I'm gonna do you know that from a seat zechariah chapter 4 in it the glory of the ladder is greater than the former but now I can see another we want to see how many also going to believe that for our lives it's easy to hear that the Word of God is sweet as honey in the mouth oh it's bitter when it comes Monday morning it's time to pray it's better on Wednesday night when you're tired but the Holy Spirit's calling you to hear the preaching of the word amen glory amen thank you Jesus this is certainly remarkable program says it's remarkable that a church can give more service to God at the end of their life in the beginning because at the beginning you had more energy right physical it's not about physical energy it's about being led of the Holy Spirit amen how many I might even go to understand this we should be more sensitive to the Holy Spirit as we get older we should be used to hearing his voice and so as we get older we shouldn't we should be able to obey more clearly than when we're going we just wanna do some forgotten will just you know jump with the hat of anything yet which is okay we're trying doing something but many times we're just spinning our wheels when were younger right like the finances us I didn't know about finances I'm spinning my wheels just paid the minimum on the mortgage paid the minimum on the man and not realizes I'm not getting anywhere I had to be a little bit more mature start paying down on some of these things and use the wisdom right same thing spiritually we start off with just trying through something but here's we get older with God we should be more in tune with the Holy Spirit's into our lives and then God can bless it more at the end and in beginning as the darkness of this age increase at the honor of the martyrs grew length here day by day they worked all the harder they served all the more they come to church they prayed less that what he says no they did more and Jesus noticed that Jesus noticed their dedication in and grow less their dedication increased and what's the prophecy getting we're going to have the same church just like the book of Acts chirps that's prophecy we're going back in order to go up I don't remember that by God's grace remember that so see as a pastor you know I look at I look at the congregation you look at my life our lives should have more dedication if we're following in line with the prophecy our dedication in Christ should increase even though we're tired even though it's hard it's going to be hard either way you're going to get a hard cold heart we're not feet all the things of God or is gonna be a hard serving God but you got to press through through the will of God and see as you serve God more what increases your favorite verses how tragic it was in the fusion Age loved waned they had their works but they left their first love they were working with us they were working without love in the first church cake at that initial revival and it truly nothing asset of the increased labor of love and the other ages I'm closing with it so stay tuned or feel better I preached about an hour and a half ago that's great god bless you for your patience I'm closing to this and truly nothing is said of the increased labor of love in the other ages another age had this testimony see that's why the church ages are so powerful Church it will just get to the channel this ain't just another sermon or another book this is what the Holy Spirit wants us to see right now we can give more service to God now our service to God can increase now it doesn't have to get weaker and weaker we can get stronger and stronger but in this age and the darkest of all ages they served him more and more what a lesson that is there is no ceasing of this gracious service of love into the Lord but rather and increasing of it that is the secret how can you wonder how can this brother have such victory how can the sister of such victory how many bless the secret you don't decrease the love or the service you increase Amen you don't love yourself and love just the people you love others you don't grow the world worldly material things you serve other people that is the secret let the enemy attempt to thwart our service to the Lord our reply is what increase certain Amen did brother Randall did what he was
