we've been doing a long series on the church ages the 7 letters that Christ sent to the 7 Gentile cities in Asia we've been almost on a year on this by God's grace and now we're in the Philadelphia and church age Revelation chapter 3 verse 7 we're just going one scripture at a time and pulling out all the revelations God has given us to it his people through His Prophet amen so we're grateful for that by God's grace as we're standing uh we have another visitor tonight my friend Danny which she works at our school a nice conversation last Friday I think we're talking about Halloween is that right and she was raised Pentecostal and I was raised by the costume and we just got to talking and she said why aren't you dressed up and I said well I just don't believe in Halloween there's this too much paganism behind that and she wasn't dressed up either we got to talking and it was a real blessing so she asked about our church and so gave her our address and everything so Danny god bless you she's uh she's seen me I'm in a hurry sometimes so she see me open the doors and almost hit kids you know so I forgive me you know you see my bad sides hopefully my good sides as well by God's grace I'm not just in a hurry to try to get my lunch back to the room and get some work done and but really appreciate her coming out to the house of Lord here tonight and also I did turn on the air so I know it's really hot in here I had it on 70 so I sent it to 66 hopefully that brings the temperature down but with all these hot bodies in here you're not going to be warm but forgive me just try to get the air on Revelation three seven how many love the Lord tonight revelation three seven let's read this together just one verse us we get on three one two three and to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write these things saith he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth let's bow our heads in word of Prayer if you ever need on your heart just make it known unto God you could raise your hand you could bow your head and God will surely meet that need as we believe tonight Heavenly Father we love you Lord tonight we're grateful for the prayers we're grateful for the songs we're grateful Lord to be in your house we're grateful most of all for your son Jesus Christ Lord crucified for our sins Lord but with the stripes we experienced healing tonight we're grateful for that thank you for the visitors Lord sister Dani and sister Connie lor were grateful Lord to have them here tonight Lord God just speak to us now by your Holy Spirit bless every heart that press their way out here or we'll be careful to give you all the glory all the honor all the praise in Jesus Christ's name and the church said amen god bless you B and C the praise God [Music] take this little thought here tonight and look at the Philadelphia Church age part 2 now a I do have some quotes and some scriptures I want to show so whenever you're ready buddy you can switch over by God's grace I just find you know if we go scripture by scripture it's nice when you can there's my stopping point you can see that it's got a few slides here by God's grace amen okay so let's look at tonight here this is the sixth letter Jesus wrote or had John write to the Gentile cities this to the Philadelphia Church age and we know it lasted from 1750 to 1906 we know that because God gave his prophet thus saith the Lord and gave it to us and we're grateful for thus saith the Lord aren't you grateful for thus saith the Lord praise God and so we thank the Lord for that so we just read one verse now there's well this is a very deep topic a very deep topic but just again to remind you from last week here we are were in the sixth Church gauge going down through the history John Wesley was the messenger the aged lasted 156 years the main battle of the day was battling the synagogue of Satan according to Jesus and the anointing that they were battling over the Anti Christ anointing was a black anointing because it was the carryover from the dark ages where we hate to say it hate to call names but we have to because the Bible calls the Roman Catholic Church the mother harlot we have to call that and we're not attacking the people it's the spirit behind the people it's the system because that woman sits on seven hills and the only city that sits on seven hills that has control over kings and monarchs and nations is the Roman Catholic Church so they started capturing the wealth of the world around a thousand AD by the indulgences a--'s and the sales of indulgences and Crusades and so forth and wars of conquest that's just plain history anybody can prove that just by reading the Britannica as we have we've already preached that but just giving you an idea so this is what the church was still battling this Antichrist spirit now we've already completed last week we started with the summary we looked at the summary this is the age of the open door this was a great missionary age of course of the Reformation which yesterday was the 500th anniversary I don't remember that the 500th anniversary of Martin Luther nailing the 95 thesis on that church door in Wittenberg there 500 years yesterday by God's grace amen that's the real that was the real holiday yesterday most of the world was into paganism but the real believer had a real holiday yesterday praise God and let me tell you - the the the protesting is still on how many know that by God's grace we're still protesting the Pope's Authority because Christ never gave them that authority it's not again it's not to attack an individual I'm not judging their eternal destination only God knows but we are judging the false doctrine we are judging the evil spirits behind that that produce you know celibacy amongst priests and worship to marry and I idol worship of idols we are attacking those evil spirits we are judging those spirits we have to because jesus said we must judge every tree by its fruit we must do that and so we looked at the city we looked at Philadelphia the Asian City there the the second greatest city of that part of it was called Lydia that part of the country of Turkey modern-day Turkey we looked at the age and the messenger how many were blessed last week by that I just was so blessed here I just want to bring a few reminders remember John Wesley just two reminders he had methods for sanctification before he was saved and then after he got saved remember he was quite a story he thought he was saved for you know this whole part of his life he went to seminary but then at 35 years old he realized I went over to save the Indians who's going to save me and then he got saved by listening to martin luther's a reading of Martin Luther's preaching at 35 years old he was born again but then he made more methods to say to say sanctified huh me no st. Paul did the same thing let's turn in your Bibles let's go to first Corinthians 9 st. Paul did the same thing Paul was that just struck me my that's inspiration of the Holy Spirit there amen Paul did the same thing before he was say remember what was he a Pharisee of Pharisees even before Paul was saved he knew I've got to I've got to take measures to keep my body from controlling me I've got to control my body right in order to live a holy life Paul did the same thing Paul was Pharisees of Pharisees but after becoming a Christian he realized I still got to keep my body under subjection to the Holy Spirit all right let's go to verse 24 this is the great illusion he gives to the Corinthians member the city of Corinth was close to Athens and Athens is where they had the Olympics and all these athletic events so Paul writes this in something that they would understand he tries to relate the gospel in a way that they'll understand like today people might use the illustration of basketball to talk about Christ or football to talk about Christ because that's what you know they would understand so Paul does the same thing in verse 24 know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the price so run that you may obtain and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we an incorruptible I therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that beateth the air but I keep my body and I bring it under subjection now listen right here last that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway amen so see in other words i've got to control my desires of my flesh so that I don't get pull away from the gospel just because I'm feeding my flesh now you see it today we talked about it tonight with money a lot of times money pulls people away fancy cars big planes big mansions big churches money will sometimes pull people away right just like with Judas had pulled him away sometimes it's family or relationships when you see broken marriages broken homes and adulteries you know in churches sometimes it's relationships that pull people wait but Paul says I'm gonna keep my body under subjection that I will not be a castaway so see the same thing with John Wesley he realizes after I got saved I got to make sure my body doesn't take over a lot of people today in America its food food becomes an idol they just feed their bodies and they and they forget that we have to fast right because we know fasting is a spiritual feast we have so many natural feasts we have so many fellowships we need to have more spiritual feasts and that's fasting and not eating like we did like I asked you to do last Friday asked you to fast last are to ask you to fast that this third grader at our school won't have cancer anymore so please if you haven't fasted please fast tomorrow by God's grace now John's nature fit his calling he was he said I never remembered 15 minutes out of an hour when I was depressed and yet he preached sometimes up to 800 sermons a year that's what history says about this man what a man now Susanna Wesley she was a prayer warrior she had 19 children but nine of them died she outlived many of her children and but she fully accepted she looked at her children and said these children are my talents from God so she went to extra lengths for them to hear the truth remember that when her husband was out fighting against heresies and others churches and the preachers weren't preaching the truth on Sundays on Sunday afternoon she would take her children and read her husband's sermon notes that's how much she loved God amen in other words if she didn't get fed at church he's gonna make sure that children got fed at home that's our real mother right there that's a real father if you're not getting that church you better make sure you get it at home there'll be no excuses on the day of judgment I with me church I'm sorry to feel chilly maybe I'm getting it up here but anyways I better preach harder than I warm up by God's grace but I don't want to freeze the church what I mean is I don't want you to be freezing I don't want you to be cold so see she went to extra lengths and we got to go to every length we can to make sure we have the truth of God's Word now she also met with her children individually for counsel and training and that's something I'm praying about you know I've got six kids now but Susana and Wesley would meet with one child every night and have a little meeting with them a short counseling and training to answer their questions and so forth that's one thing I'm considering doing by God's grace we like to do that my wife and I get a lot of time to talk to the kids though we appreciate that and but that's something that that she modeled a member her son Charles Wesley wrote 6,000 hymns and her and her other son John was the messenger to the aged preached thousands upon thousands of sermons want winning thousands of thousands upon souls so we make sure we gotta get the Word of God and we got to be dedicated to the Word of God that's real dedication right there now I'm gonna take the next part of this sermon here tonight and I'm gonna hit some highlights from the sermon that our prophet preached on December 10th 1960 on the Philadelphia Church age so I'm gonna bring out some thoughts but I'm first going to show you the outline of the sermon so you're aware of it and I rotated the colors this I thought this would help you see a little better he starts off for the first few minutes with the age the messenger in the summary of the Philadelphia Church age and then he reviews the previous ages for about seven minutes and then he gave more history on John Wesley for about four minutes and then he preached on the open door the missionary age and power and not in word only that was almost 23 minutes there then he preached on Jesus is the open door Jesus is God the name of Jesus and the Holy Ghost covenant for about 22 more minutes and then he preached on the supreme deity of Jesus Christ and the key of David for about five minutes and then he preached then he got down to the individual attributes of the church age the little strength that Jesus said they had the deity again in the name of Christ and water baptism and then he preached on the synagogue of satan' Jesus mentioned and then he preached on the hour temptation the crown reward the pillar reward and the new name reward and then they sang and did the closing for a few minutes that for that so if you haven't listened that has anybody who gone back and listened to the Philadelphia Church age nobody okay if you you might want to do that I'm gonna probably preach on this on Sunday by God's grace to give you some good background on that so tonight I'm gonna look at some important quotes from this sermon here so let's let's look at this quotation now the first quote that struck me was being in the right condition we must be in the right condition for the Holy Spirit to move now here's a little mention at the beginning of the message so we approach in Jesus name tonight asking that you'll bless us as we congregate ourselves army together to study the word and to know what you have for us in store for tonight that we might build up our spiritual bodies to a lively church now look at this a church where you could live and walk in and feel comfortable walking among your people telling us what to do and know that we do it right away how many want to be a church like that where Jesus could give us some instruction and then we do it right now we wouldn't put it off till next week we wouldn't put it off till next year we do it tonight by God's grace look at his next thought here and we love you Father but we know we're not quite in condition yet that you could speak through us just like you wish to isn't that quite a statement he recognizes we're not in the condition yet where you could just speak through us and then you ask for a fresh circumcision of the Holy Spirit cut away all the foolishness I'd say that I'd say amen to that tonight god help us to get all the foolishness out of our lives presenting foolish you shouldn't be doing that get it out of our lives so God can speak through us and I'm gonna skip past that one now I'm gonna skip ahead a couple years here yeah three years and then the Prophet preached this sermon called perfect faith from James chapter 2 and I want to read this he has a long prayer line and he's encouraging the people to have faith and at the end of the prayer line he says now we're coming into the third pole which is the final move of the Holy Spirit before the rapture the Bible tells us that it's the call the latter rain in the Joel chapter 2 it's the latter rain he says I want to ask you sincere question you that pass through the prayer line can you actually believe and feel now that there's something happened to you since you've had hands laid on you he said raise your hand there it is this is just what we've waited for this is just starting to bloom now I did this for a purpose I'm working out something see it's taking this charge of faith and going right back to begin and come in see the kind of raised faith in a bracket where you've never noticed it that way before not a faith but a perfect faith and building up in here amen look at this and watch a perfect God with a perfect heart keep a perfect promise by His perfect word which is sharper than a two-edged sword and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart he says we're coming now to perfection because the people has to come to this in order for the rapture that's what's holding it away right now is waiting for that church to come to that perfect raptured faith looking for it now look it means a lot of shaving down for me it means a lot for you but together we'll make it by the grace of God so I want to bring out these two quotes because in 1960 he can say we're not in condition two for you to speak to us and now three years later he said we're getting into rapture and condition amen so see Church well I bring this out because we want to look at our lives and say em is my life getting more in a raptured condition now than it was last year praise God there's my life if I look back three years ago is my life more holy or is it more relaxed our lives should be more holy by the grace of God we should see our lives turning more like Christian lives right more and more than the image of Christ but it requires a great shaving down praise God it requires more of a sanctification I don't know if you've seen this quote before but I don't know if this is prophecy or not but I just want to read this quote from July of 63 now the Prophet said don't forget this Tabernacle will lose its strength and he shows how they're gonna lose their strength Satan had every gun in Hell trained on it he'll cause one person to do something that's contrary to what the other thinks he said that Satan's business if you can get somebody to say something and talk about somebody else and say well listen did you know so-and-so did this don't listen to it don't listen to it at all that's the devil see it's Satan don't believe it in other words gossip will weaken a church praise the Lord gossip will weaken a church that's how Satan comes in real suddenly real innocently and he says the tabernacle will lose its strength so it had strength so much so he said I see people accepting their healing right in the prayer line I see people with rapturing faith moving upon their hearts and this is almost over 50 years ago and he sees it but he said it's going to lose its strength now we must watch what we say with our words I'm going to say help me Jesus with my words help me not to gossip about anybody in church help me to say only what's right about other people you see if not we're gonna lose our strength spiritually and and if you know for our sister Connie and I preached a message last year about the move in Jeffersonville because there's there's a lot of censor people but I believe what's happened is they got a false doctrine where it says pastors shouldn't preach anymore and that's I believe that's a false doctrine I preached a whole sermon on that and but we love them you know we love them I've talked to different people from that church and really really wonderful people but any spirit that denies the Word of God is the wrong spirit and when that spirit says pastors don't preach anymore yet the Bible says preach until everybody gets perfected something's wrong with that spirit right and the Holy Spirit will pick that up right away because the Holy Spirit is the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart but see the Wheatley says they're gonna lose their strength because the gosh and they're gonna fall away a little bit from their strength so we must turn Satan down now I got a thought here I want to bring out here the next thought is overlapping of the ages again this is pretty deep you know so sister Danny I apologize this is a really deep message I know it's really really deep we were talking about some deep scriptures to remember that we're talking about the Queen of Sheba and and the men of Nineveh and how they raised up in judgment against Jesus's generation you know the Pharisees but this is a really deep thought right here but I hope you can catch it by God's grace and I'm what I'm gonna do is I'm just going to skip because of time I'm gonna skip just to the Vitter to the visual and let's look in your Bible so now let's take our Bibles let's go back to revelation 3 I think I just I'm feeling like I need to go back there revelation 3:10 now we read verse 7 but let's go to verse 10 I think it'd just be better if I just flip flip ahead here and show how the ages overlap okay I just want to do that I think the to show it might be right here I think this might be the best way now remember we're preaching on the Philadelphia Church age but revelation 3 verse 11 Jesus spoke to this word to this church age but the word was actually going to be fulfilled in the next age which shows the influence of the ages overlap and I have a Bible example but I want to just go over this one first so revelation 3 verse 10 what any we like to read that for me tonight by God's grace Adam okay thank you sir amen so in this Philadelphia Church age in verse 10 Jesus says if you keep my word I'm gonna keep you from the hour temptation that will come upon the whole earth now that's in Revelation 13 so let's go to that the hour of temptation is where everybody is forced to take the mark of the beast or die that's what Jesus is speaking of revelation 13 now let's just read a verse verse 15 revelation 13:15 so this scripture shows there's a little bit of overlap Jesus warns this age about it but it actually overlaps to the next age so Jesus is preparing the future generations for the time of the Tribulation Period and if you listen to this message the Philadelphia Church age you'll hear him say lap over over lap lap over lap over over and over again and so I want to bring that thought so you're clear on it all right yes revelation 3:15 and he had power to give life under the image of the Beast that image of the Beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the Beast should be killed remember what is the Beast the Beast is the spirit of Rome that is the Beast because daniel said there's four beasts and Daniel said that last beast that beast that that stands there all the way the end time was iron and clay and we know that was turned out to be the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant churches that are apostate so this has to be the spirit of Rome the beast is the spirit of Rome now verse 16 and he causes all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads and that no man might buy or sell save the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name here in his wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred threescore and six so we know the number of 666 is the number of the Pope because his Latin title is vicarious filet de in Latin and if you add up all those Roman numerals it's 666 and the Bible said that the Pope or the Antichrist sits in the temple of God exalting himself all that's above God all that's called God he sits above that and the Pope does the same today he everything he says it doesn't matter what the Bible says it's what he says so we know that's going to happen so Jesus was speaking of this time at the tribulation he says if you keep my word I'll keep you from the hour of temptation now just I just added a few life times in here so there's Luther that's what Martin Luther which yes yesterday was the 500 anniversary of Reformation there's John Wesley's life this is the life we're talking about now his life overlapped the age a little bit and then our prophet we believe was William Branham he was vindicated by God he had prophecies that came to pass a genuine prophet of God now here's where Jesus said the hour temptation now I hope everybody gets this Benjamin god bless you sir nice to see you Jesus set it to the Philadelphia Church age but it actually applied to the next age can everybody see that there's an overlap so that great temptation didn't happen in the Philadelphia Church age it's going to happen sometime soon in the future no man knows the day or the hour but we know the tribulation is coming amen this nation is ripe for judgment right it's right for judgment all the abortions all the homosexual and legalized sin all this legalized sin if God doesn't destroy this nation for all its legalize sin it's gonna have to raise up sila and gomorrah and apologize that right so this nation is under judgment so the our temptation is to come so i wanted you to see the overlap that we're talking about does everybody understand so there's overlap overlap sometimes Jesus speak a word but it'll overlap into the next age it'll overlap into the next generation we see that by the grace of the Lord now this might be a review for you too there's an overlap here with Colombia I preached on this a few months ago Colombo was the messenger to the fire to your church age but he actually lived before the church age started so see that shows another lap over his message and ministry finish but it lapped over into the age that he was the messenger for and remember he converted the entire nation of Ireland praise God entire nation this man was such a mighty man of God people flocked to hear his preaching they became Christians and they started churches all over Ireland amen all because of a man who's on fire hallelujah amen now here's the example of a lap over in acts 19 let's go to acts 19 verse 1 here's a good Bible example of a lap over X 19 1 and maybe I have some more readers Malachi we'd like to read a little bit for me Lydia would you like okay now all right Benjamin okay Malachi why don't you read verses 1 2 & 3 all right pause right there so here's a lap over these Christians were in Ephesus and they're living from the previous of John the Baptist which was just a few years beforehand but God had already entered into another covenant which was the Holy Ghost covenant amen John the Baptist only baptized for repentance he said but ones coming after me who will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire a man that's exactly right so John's baptism just lasted a few years but it overlapped into the next ministry which was the baptism of the Holy Ghost ministry praise God and now Benjamin can you read why don't you read four and five sir amen so can everybody see that they were under the previous baptism now John was just baptizing he just said confess your sins I'm gonna baptize you that's all it was which was a great thing is it repentance a great thing how that it's great to find someone that will truly repent of their sins it's hard to find cuz Jesus said few there be that find that way it's the way of repentance and repentance means turning 180 degrees and not walking into sin anymore it's hard to find that but real believers have that praise God amen okay but this baptism that was just John's baptism this baptism was to get filled with Christ fill what the Holy Ghost its Christ in you the hope of glory this was the mystery that got a kept secret for 4,000 years praise God that was the mystery right because God dwelt with his people but he wanted to be in the people praise God holiday he dwelt with Adam and Eve but he wanted to be he couldn't be in them yet he dwelt with John the Baptist but he couldn't be in him but then he come to Pentecost the day of Pentecost and now God was in them praise God it was God in His creation praise God now they're filled with the Holy Ghost praise God that's exactly right now so John's baptism was no longer in effect once the Holy Ghost had been given they were living under it but God blessed the Ephesians with genuine sanctification under the truth of the previous age the ministries left over a bit but see God will honor anybody who sincerely receives the ministry that's brought to you that's the thing to do church if we can be that since here tonight I'll live everything I know God will bless us amen if we can live everything that we know if we can live everything that we heard God will bless us until we hear more amen until we hear more of the word that we need to hear praise God it's exactly right so see they laugh over but God always sends the true word to the people who want it by God's grace see these people wanted more of God so God could send it now Church this is why I believe this is why I believe you can only be born again by hearing the message of the hour is every with me they were defied the Ephesians were sanctified but they couldn't get the Holy Ghost until somebody came preaching the true message of the hour amen how you gonna be born again in a denomination don't even believe in the Holy Ghost you can't you gotta be born again in a church that believes in the power of God that believes in the filling of the Holy Spirit you have to be in a church that preaches that they could never live any higher than the preaching that they heard me the same way it is for us today if we went live higher we got to hear higher preaching praise the Lord if you want to live higher you got to hear higher preaching right you got to bring your body into subjection we got a live higher in Christ Jesus amen exactly right now this might be my last few thoughts here I got 30 minutes so I'll try to finish up I'd like I said I tried do an hour here I got some more thoughts I want to bring out and then I got end with some scriptures here by the grace of the Lord so in this sermon from 1960 I want to go back to that Philadelphia Church age sermon I read this and it really blessed me I said last night was Martin Luther which we just celebrated the reason I'm getting this and the boys are putting it on tape talking about recording this sermon all day long and you say all day long on just what little history you give here he says no the historical points will go in the book see the book of the seven church age and I left it at school on my desk today so I don't have the book to hold up but it's out there if you like a copy the reason to get here is to get these things pulled out by the inspiration from before you people where we gather together to get the inspirational part of it the history I can read that out of the book now I just bring this thought out to show you that the Prophet would study on the history to have the history but he would come on the Holy Spirit revealing something to him while he's preaching the Word of God praise the Lord while the Saints are gathered believing and worshiping and loving God and praying and calling out to heaven we could expect the Holy Spirit to reveal something fresh to us are you with me amen so the same is the famous for us tonight if we're really loving God and believing God's Word we can expect God to reveal something fresh to us tonight but we have to meet the conditions here he says it again I want to read this to you but here's where I'm looking for inspiration from that we pick it up on the tape we got he said in the book then we'll have both the historical data of the Philadelphia Church age and also the inspiration of the Holy Spirit to give us while we're together here this heavenly places in Christ Jesus I hope you feel like that tonight like we're in a heavenly place here by God's grace I feel it I don't know about you but I feel it I'm at work all day or I go to different stores on the weekend and I feel dirty in the world but when I come here I feel like I'm in heaven praise God because this is where the worship of Christ is given this is where praise and prayers are offered this is where his word is preached this is where Christ is magnified amen this is his house it's a house of prayer praise God so see this is heavenly places and I believe look at this it ought to make a striking little commentary on these church ages and the Lord grant us blessings to it how many feel that way about the church age book it's a striking little commentary on Revelation chapters 1 2 and 3 absolutely Church absolutely now here's what I want to say it for us this is what we said about gossiping earlier or any-any sin amongst believers the Prophet says is if you got a resenting audience that means people that don't like the preacher are people that don't like the piano player people any anyone that's upset with anybody here if you resent anybody here you'll shut down the Holy Spirit see if you got a resenting this audience the Holy Spirit won't reveal and you know why because Ephesians 4:30 let's read that Ephesians 4:30 let's read that just so you know it's actually scriptural visions for 30 of course visions for 30 see the profit when to get inspiration while the body of Christ was gathered together that's what we want to get we want to get inspiration while we're gathered here tonight hallelujah and I feel like I already got some with that the type of Paul and John Wesley they both had sanctification before and they both got it after a man that wasn't even in my notes I was a revelation of the Holy Spirit I believe by God's grace and what is that for it's so that you and I will sanctify our lives the you and I will try to live a more sanctified holy life hey can the church say Amen that means you got a fast that means you got to cut out all the foolishness you got to see God gonna spend time in prayer got to spend time listening to the Word of God got to fall in love with Jesus all over again that's right that's right now Ephesians 4:30 who can read that for me by God's grace Adam okay back down thank you sir Adam okay so see you can be a Christian but then you can offend that's what the word grieve means you can offend the Holy Spirit and the best example is like a little dove right a real dove is gentle and sweet and it coos and everything like that but if you start getting all upset around it what does it do it flies away well that's how that's how you and I are if we're not real sensitive to the Holy Spirit that anointing and power just flies away and we wonder where's my mind my mind is not even on God what what happened we grieve the Holy Spirit and that's what happens here we come into church and we're upset with this person I'm upset with that person I'm except with the preacher I'm upset with the preacher's wife or you can name it hey you put your name in there see the Holy Spirit won't reveal because he's offended and that's absolutely scriptures anybody understand you've got to have something that working together look acts 2 verse 1 they were all in what a place in one Accord and then there came a sound from heaven rushing sea but no matter how much i pray look at this i know and lay day and night studying and praying before the lord walk down here maybe the anointing is on me walk up here and feel that resentment see it just leaves him right away he won't reveal nothing how many churches are in that condition they're so upset with each other they're so upset with somebody else that the Holy Spirit can't reveal anything to anybody because of spirits you see the Bible said you got to cast down anything that exalts itself against the Word of God it has to be cast down we can't hold evil spirits we can't hold evil thoughts we got to have our minds pure by the Word of God you see that we want inspiration we want to come here and be inspired oh I'm inspired by Susanna Wesley I'm inspired by John Wesley well let's see it by your life church set that was real quiet see we ought to draw inspiration this inspiration tonight our last year at least tomorrow at least at least tonight you ought to catch some inspiration that'll inspire you to draw closer to God tonight if not what what happened it's not God it's not God's fault God's not trying to keep the inspiration from you God's trying to get it to you it's us in our own sin is what keeps the inspiration away that's true see no matter how much a preacher can be anointed if we're all not anointed he's grieved away and when you walk down here under the anointing and feel your audience under the anointing that's when the Holy Spirit begins to work then and then he begins to move and do great things for us amen hallelujah now here gives another idea on it I think we need the Christ yes sir only way we see Christ is when he reflects in each other I see Christ in you you see Christ in me that's how we watch Christ I come to the meeting now here's he's a preacher right he's a prophet I start preaching I watch the people you can see whether they're interested or not in just a few minutes see that's what I do I look out and see whoa in my heart one who's interested who really wants to hear from God or who's resenting tonight who's accepting who's who's resenting we want to accept what the Holy Spirit's a seat your us will grieve the Holy Spirit you look over the audience you can tell whether you're boring them or whether you're not Jesus Christ should not bore us we should be excited about Christ something's wrong if we're not excited about the Word of God because we just preached a few Sundays ago there are unsearchable riches in Christ you can't you can't even search it out it's so great you'll never get to the bottom of it but you've got a desire it we've got to believe that how can Jesus be boring and the LA Lakers are exciting how is that possible heaven and earth will pass away the Lakers and the New England Patriots will pass away but Jesus word will never pass away how can that be more exciting than Jesus Christ the God of heaven amen the king of kings those kings in the sports worlds rise and fall Magic Johnson gets AIDS and Michael Jordan gets old and they rise and fall but Jesus Christ is still king of kings and Lord of lords whether they like it or not see it's it's our attitude church it's our attitude but see when you the first thing you know when they're hanging on every word it's kinda like preach to me preacher tell me the Word of God tell me about Jesus when you're acting like that he says see then I'm seeing Christ reflected in the person because they're hungry and thirsting for God we've got to hunger and thirst for God are you with me Oh hallelujah so if people are hungry and I'm preaching the prophets that see preaching the gospel he sees Christ reflecting in me I see the Christ reflecting in him that means Christ is in our midst then you see that when people are hungry for for God and are excited about the preaching and I'm preaching now we know Christ is here because people want to hear about Christ they're excited about Christ not about money or popularity or all this nonsense they're excited about Jesus Christ but you've got to reflect it and I've got to reflect it we've all got to be a part of that and that's when the inspiration will come praise the Lord it's exactly right that's the anointing that's the one accord right one in one place in one Accord of the Holy Spirit that's right now see now I say something and watch what effect it takes on them I watch their face light up full of joy Oh preachers like to see that I love to see that even when somebody just gets all joyful about Jesus amen hallelujah like I said the world wants us to be joyful about everything else but one place we ought to be full of joy is in the house of God then they're ready right then to receive something that's Christ's glory see but your face has got to be into you got to you can't you can't you can't hide it from God right Cain left the presence of the Lord the Bible said and his countenance changed his face changed right but if we stay in the presence of Lord like Steven then even when he's being stoned he has angel face hallelujah and the angel face even when he's at death's door why because he was so connected to Christ he was so reflecting Christ that they saw an angel on him amen oh god help us to have that anointing amen in the midst of our trials people will see Christ on our faces our face tells the story of the joy that's in our heart yes sir you see he said I see Christ reflecting in that person because the gospel the simple gospel of Christ is taking a hold in their heart because they're hungry and thirsty we got to come to church hungry we got to come to church thirsty and then we got to accept what God says and we got to thank God for what God says praise the Lord now this is actually scriptural yeah you don't think about your Bibles but before Peter Hill this paralyzed man he said look on us he had to have eye contact did you ever notice that in the scripture that paralyzed man couldn't be saying okay give me some money okay preacher whatever he had to look at that preacher and they both had to have faith in God's Word they had to have a cassette this that had to be in one Accord that'd be one Accord he said look on us and they said silver and gold have I none but such as I have give ID in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth he said arise and walk praise God and the Prophet said this and you know it's true the problem is today we got too much silver and gold we need what Peter had power amen hallelujah we need power we don't need the silver and gold we need power but the world tells us we need more silver and gold more money God's God's moving is never in money God's Word is always in simplicity his power is in humility praise God humming ourselves hungry for God's Word believing God's Word that's all it takes is the humble simplicity of a believer praise God looking on the the preacher looking on the Word of God or looking at your Bible or looking in prayer focusing on the Word of God and it can literally change our lives if we just look at it the right way but it's got to be a hunger and thirst for righteousness that's right now read this last week now I'm gonna skip down here he says there are times I like to be all alone with my Christ my lord I can tell them all my troubles all alone that's what we need again then kind of a meetings that kind of a church that's the kind of church that prays down the blessings of God remember what did uh what did Salman say said my people were not there assembled in what my name if they'll humble themselves and call upon God the Bible said he'd pour out his spirit and he'd heal their land see when we assemble here we got a call on the name of Jesus we got to pray down the blessing Lord send the blessing Lord heal the child Lord give her give her the unspoken request Lord save souls we have to we have to pray the blessings down we have to humble ourselves and pray a real prayer praise God and not just you know Lord bless John Lord bless Jesse Lord bless Ben Lord bless amen that's not a real prayer we got to pray in the Holy Spirit that's right church where we stop worrying about who's here stop worrying about who's here at us we just got to know God's here in us amen that's the kind of real spirit prayer amen we don't care who's around us we got to be a church that prays down the blessings of God that's right he said I'm sure your pastor would appreciate every member becoming like that I would and I'd appreciate myself being more dedicated to prayer and how it would be if the church would just be like that can you imagine what our church would be like if we just prayed until the blessings came down think about that we prayed until the blessing came down hallelujah I hope you're seeing we have a lot of room to grow Church we're a young church right we just started our church 11 years ago we're a young church we need to learn how to pray the blessings of God down we have to learn that now I got a lot of scriptures I'm going to close with here and I got 12 minutes okay plenty of time there by God's grace now I limit myself because if not I'm gonna wear out my voice I'm gonna lose my voice again and I told the Lord I won't do that because I'm not controlling myself like Paul said I got to control myself so I want to just pull out a few more scriptures that inspired me this is I just want to share this this is inspiration that struck me as we're preaching these church ages this is Bible inspiration that struck me that has actually helped me in my Christian walk have you been helped in your Christian walk since we've been preaching the series I hope somebody can say Amen I have I know I have and so I'm going to share some of these specific examples right from the scripture that have given me inspiration as I preached it because that's what we're supposed to have we're supposed to be inspired when we leave here my I love when the Holy Spirit spoke to my heart here I love when God gave me his promise here I love when I felt the blessing of God here I love when God healed me there we need to be inspired in the house of God it has to be that way and I was praying last Sunday night even after brother Simon preached I was praying God help us to be a church where people can feel the power of God in our church any church can have preaching any church can have singing but we want the power of God where it convicts people to repent where brings sinners to repentance right where it heals the sick praise God where it does miracles amongst us where it speaks in tongues and interprets praise God where it gives gifts of knowledge and words of wisdom and all these things all the moving of the Holy Spirit gifts of faith gifts of miracles we want to be a church where we're known by the power of God that's right it has there been power yes brother Jesse yes I say yes there has been power God has healed people here we're thankful for that but we just want to see more of it we want to see more of it and we can't let up we can't let up we can't get relaxed we can't get comfortable when you do that you lose your first love and you're on your road out I'll say like Paul you're on the way to be a castaway you're on the road to be a castaway we're God will cast you a I don't want to be cast away I want to be a faithful loyal Christian I want to be cast away from God's presence member David said cast me not away from your presence of Lord but renew a steadfast spirit within me help me to be more steadfast with my love for you Jesus how many be a more faithful Christian I hope our hearts desire that tonight amen so let me bring these out I got a few more minutes here I got one two three four five six about six more scriptures can you bear with six more scriptures okay I know you can search I know you've never turned me down one time I just want to hear your approval okay and I hope you're blessed here tonight okay now Ezekiel 46 9 this was inspired to me as I preached as I read it I caught the inspir felt I call inspiration of the Holy Spirit now you can believe different but I know it's helped my life because I know from this scripture I cannot leave the house of God the same way I came I preached us about welcome numerous months ago I'm really bad at estimating time but in zico 46 9 the Bible said when the people of the land shall come before the Lord and the solemn feast he the entereth by the way of the north gate to worship shall go by the way of the south gate so if you came in the north gate you gotta lead the south gate and he that enters by the way the south gate should go forth by the way of the north gate he should not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in but he should go forth over against it and this was a revelation to me because this scripture said God would not let you in the feast day he would not let you leave the church the same way you came amen that's what I'm talking about I let my church that all inspire you if you left the same way you came and you came in resenting and you left for setting shame on you you ought to leave a different way cuz God commanded you to leave a different way God ordained you to leave a different way I don't have to be the same person so many times in high school that's before I serve God that's what happened I would be so convicted by my Pentecostal pastor I love him Randy Trowbridge I would sometimes he would jump like this I'm gonna he would jump like this from times like that I'd be like glory and I'm like 15 years old and I would repent my seat and say Jesus forgive me but as soon as I left that church I went out to the car and turned on the rock-and-roll station and all my love for God left that's before I was a Christian you see I I was convicted but then I left the same way I came I drove out of the parking lot the same way I came and defeated we've got to have an experience where you're so inspired you walk out that door confident and knowing I'll never be the same Amen if not then we didn't get what we came for right we left the same way we came we got to leave differently than when we came and maybe it's with gossip like we said her maybe I struggle with greed maybe I struggle with lust maybe I struggle with this or that or that we can leave differently but we got to make sure we follow God's Word and say Lord inspire me give me the strength touch me tonight I need you you got a hunger and thirst for God and you can leave the different way tonight by God's grace so see that's a natural type of a spiritual truth because honey no judgment begins to the house of God how many know that this is a courtroom tonight you're gonna leave here forgiven and blessed and and full of joy judged forgiven or gonna leave here condemned right or in sin or discouraged or full of evil or full of lust like we said you're gonna leave here one way or the other it's your choice it's your choice because God is here to pardon you if you want to be pardoned because let's read this let's go to acts 13 now I on YouTube I've been get a lot of comments like oh you're judging me about this I've had my most popular videos make up in the Bible where I show how we shouldn't wear makeup the men or women but mostly women you know cuz that's that's the temptation for women but I keep getting these comments I get a lot of good comments a lot of good ones but the ones that don't like my teaching they say they say oh you're judging me and I say I'm not judging you I'm judging make up I'm judging make up and saying make up is wrong it's a heathen trait it's from the Egyptians and God told Israel don't learn the ways of the heathen it's a command right it's a Bible command and all three women that wore makeup in the Bible were immoral idol worshippers Jezebel is the most famous one and they think or you're judging me I never I never said you're going to hell I just said makeup is a sin because it's heathen and I said what you're doing though is if you love the world and love makeup and love these things then if you love the world the Bible said the love of God is not even in you how many can understand that by God's grace like again if I go to LA Lakers and I love Lonzo ball or go to the Cavs I love LeBron Jayde I scream for more for LeBron James and Jesus Christ I'm an idol worshiper and that player is my idol that's true that's very true acts 13 I believe it's 43 or 46 I just kind of came to my heart so bear with me I'm just have to give me a minute to skin the page you you and I judge ourselves yeah it's 446 who'd like to read that 13:46 Malachi okay then maybe Benjamin the next one maokai 1346 you will judge yourself yeah who judged the Jews here they judged themselves can every see that they judge themselves your attitude towards the word is your judgment either for yourself or against yourself do you either judge the word is right or my own attitude is right right and when Jesus plays back your life on the screen and all these at the white throne judgment for people and he's gonna say you judge yourself you judge me unfaithful you judge me I wasn't important you judge me I wasn't the love of your life you judged me and Jesus said because you do that now I'll judge you and you you're eternally lost does everybody see that by God's grace you judge yourself right but they're saying well you're judging me I'm not saying where you're going I'm just judging the sin does that help go to Philippians 1 now this one that came to me as well go to Philippians 1 I just love these nuggets by God's grace amen Philippians 1 now I just went there by memory I could have the wrong chapter but it's a scripture about judgment okay yeah it's verse 9 so Paul wrote this letter from prison to the church at Philippi look what he said in verse 9 and this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all what church all judgment so see everybody judges everybody judges but see we judge by the love of God that's what's different about you and I we judge makeup or we judge judge cussing or we judge idol worship of sports figures or we judge alcoholism and transgender and all these things homosexuality and abortion we judge all that with the love of God with the love of God Paul said you need more and more love so that you can judge the right way glory hallelujah see that's a policy this is Holy Writ grow and love that you can judge things the right way because that's what that's what the discerning gift is discerning is judging discerning is judging this is of God this is of Satan how many know we need the discernment gifts in the church this is of God this is of Satan we need to judge the spirits alright hope that was okay that wasn't those who were not in my notes but I hope that's a blessing to you okay go to Revelation 219 we'll have two briefly hit these revelation 219 I hope by God's grace you receive some tonight that's what we're supposed to get when we're gathered together we're supposed to have inspiration revelation 2:19 remember I'm looking at your faces you're looking at my face we wouldn't have a face that glorifies the Lord yes Lord I believe that we're I'm hungry for more you were I believe the truth they men of the hunger and thirst for righteousness revelation 2:19 this was a great revelation to me I know thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first and the Prophet picks up the scripture he says do you see the secret to the Christian life when trials come on you you don't give God less of yourself you give God more of yourself he said that is the secret to the Christian life and like I said we see so many people pulling away from church dedications pulling away from other things instead of giving God more that you've got and the secret to Christianity is fighting through not looking at all the symptoms not looking at the problems but looking at the victory that Christ promised us a man because now you're looking at eyes of faith hallelujah now you're looking the long-term I see Christ I see him coming whether it's in my lifetime or not it doesn't matter if I die be the first one to rise amen that's right I'll be the first one to rise because that the dead in Christ will rise first amen and we're looking long-term so we don't compromise on the Word of God we give more of our lives to God more of our time more of ourselves the last is more than the first what about the last church age go hurry hallelujah amen the last is more than the first that's why I harp on that's why I try to remind you give more of God don't skip church or don't miss the sermon if you miss it go back and listen to it don't miss feeding on God's Word because it's going to become a habit pretty soon then you're gonna be in the habit of not hungry down them thirsting for the word anymore they're gonna wonder where the Spirit of God go you offended him you aggrieved him you're filling your life with things that are not more valuable the most valuable thing is the word of Christ because the word is a seed and the seed has life in it amen glory revelation 2 - this kind of ties in what we're saying a little bit about the false doctrines and some of our sister churches there's my hour let me set a timer here maybe tried 10 more minutes here I just need the reminder because I gotta shut down here revelation 2 - okay where the bench make you read to - thank you sir now one Revelation as I was preaching one inspiration I got to was where the prophet in the book says the true Passos would walk up to the false apostles and say you are not saying what Paul said therefore you are false and that was a great revelation to me because people today are saying pastors don't have to preach anymore just play the tape and church if we had enough bonus or if we letter the Holy Spirit to do that we could walk up to people that are trying to discount pastors and we could say you are not saying what Paul said therefore you are false I know that's rough I know that's hard but that's the truth Paul said if you change one thing about what he preached you're cursed did you know whatever you know that let's go three - Galatians 1 let's read that he said if you change one thing I preached you're cursed because he didn't get the gospel from his own thought he got it from Jesus Christ look at Galatians 1 eighth cavalry - for that by God's grace okay amen and then now okay so amen read 8/9 sir thank you sir Malakai read verse 12 this is why they're cursed because if you change one thing Paul preached you're changing really what Jesus told him to preach okay now go ahead verse 12 amen praise God let's say praise the Lord ready praise the Lord see you can't change what Paul said you can't if you change that you become cursed and you see people falling away into sin that's why they change what Paul said they're liars Paul said I was taught the gospel by Jesus Christ don't change it just say what he said now I don't know if you read this but I just read this yesterday morning and I was blown away go to 2nd Thessalonians 1 I'll try to I better close with this because I'm just gonna I just hi mercy Lord amen second Thessalonians chapter 1 I just can't be discouraged I just got to preach and be be good 2nd Thessalonians chapter 1 verse 8 actually this back to verse seven now what's Paul saying in verse five and six is that those people who persecute Christians are going to experience the wrath of God that's what he's saying in verse five and six now think about people that have persecuted you you and I don't want to see them persecuted but the truth is many of them will not repent because remember it's always the false seed that persecutes the true seed right it was Ishmael that persecuted Isaac right and that's what Paul said in Galatians chapter 3 so we'll they'll be at the end time the false pretending church always persecute the true church the Church of Jesus Christ now look at verse 7 and to you who are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels look at this in flaming fire taking what this struck me this blew me out of my chair almost I'm reading I'm like what vengeance Jesus is coming back with vengeance that means revenge he's gonna get revenge on all those who spoke bad about his word he's not in the Vengeance mode right now but when he comes back it's vengeance time and this struck me because all to hear Jesus love Jesus love he loves you yes he does God loves you got us up but when he comes back it's vengeance in other words you got to pay the price if you spoke evil against the Holy Ghost so if you denied the word of God in this case if you didn't obey the gospel he's coming back with vengeance and there's a reason for that but let's read them in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God see that we're born again of the Holy Ghost and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ who shall be what punished with everlasting fire I'm sorry everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power how come we don't hear before this preach as much because it will drive people out of the church but not the true people out of church it'll drive make believers out but it won't drive out true believers amen glory and wise Jesus have vengeance it's because of all these scriptures Jesus here we'll just I just briefly touched these in this scripture the Bible says the way of holiness is so simple a fool won't air in it this scripture revelation 22:17 says whosoever is hungry thirsty let him come let it let whosoever come let him come Jesus is inviting everybody and this scripture says that Jesus gives us every spiritual blessing that we could possibly desire in other words Jesus is offering the gospel to everyone it's so simple just stop loving the world and fall in love with Jesus amen so because they turned him down and they rather have a house a football well rather have Pittsburgh penguin hockey because they'd rather worship that Jesus has to come back with vengeance because he offered it so freely he gave everything he died on the cross he sent the Holy Ghost he sent preachers preaching his word he did everything he put it on radio he put it on internet he put it everywhere and they still turned him down they spit in his face in other words the Bible say they trample under feet the Son of God they say I don't have time for that nonsense they trampled under and the Bible said they crucify him afresh a second time that's right and because of that he comes back with vengeance I'm gonna get revenge on these that did not obey the gospel Church this is a serious thing tonight help us to be faithful let's stand to our feet I better stop there I just thought of I got a whole nother screen another group of scriptures but now it's almost out of o'clock that's got to stop by God's grace you know we have two visitors here so I'm always a little more excited with visitors you know you're so thankful praise the Lord yeah but the point is the scripture is what's inspiring when we're gathered and believing loving Christ we can receive inspiration from the Holy Spirit now thus powerheads how many would raise your hand say the Lord thank you Lord forgive me inspiration I okay god bless those hands that really helps my heart hallelujah how many to say lord help me to be faithful how many raise your hand for that how much say lord help me to hunger and thirst for righteousness how many hands God bless those hands now let's pray for one another Heavenly Father we love you tonight Lord God what a striking thought Lord God as I read that yesterday Lord stay with me all day that you're coming back with vengeance I thought what who do you have to get revenge against all those who speak evil of this glorious life-changing inspirational Holy Ghost power hallelujah amen glory this word that sets the captive free assets the Attucks free hallelujah its it sets the sinner free it breaks the chains of bondage it's free to everyone but because they turn it down for the love of the world you're coming back with vengeance Lord I don't want to be on that side I don't want to be on the side that is having the benjin's of God I want to be on Christ's side hallelujah hallelujah how they do use Jesus we thank you Lord for tonight Lord God you saw the hands Lord they want to obey your Lord God they want to receive inspiration bless each and every hand that was raised thank you that you gave people inspiration here and I trust those hands were honest hands dear God I'm inspired tonight Lord God thank you for showing me Lord how Paul and John were similar now help me to apply it to my life help me or to bring my body under subjection to the Holy Spirit all they're doing it Jesus Lord this is a serious thing and Lord we humble ourselves we bow our heads and ask you Lord strengthen us Lord here tonight bless us Jesus and your divine presence oh god bless our visitors bless those who have been with us all these years Lord God faithfully serving you god bless their hearts we love you Jesus nordicist rizal my heart to share all this inspiration that I've received just from this little series I felt as I preached and as I studied I felt the Holy Spirit burned in my heart you cannot leave the same way you came hallelujah he said our last works have to be more than our first works and that burns in
