world he saw us in his mind before the foundation of the world and in the midst of our going the wrong way he called us to go back to what the vision said that we ought to be amen and I'm just I'm just so glad that he did Amen because I know that his vision is perfect amen his vision is beautiful hey man this is the God that created the mountains they created the oceans they created everything that we enjoy about this planet amen he is willing to create all those things amen and he created them according to a vision that was in his mind a man in that same vision spoke of you spoke of you spoke of you that same vision is just as beautiful a man is what the mountains is as the oceans that same vision is just as beautiful amen and we are walking right into that hey man we're stepping right into it amen it'll be a beautiful thing beautiful hey man so this evening I just want to preach a message I think your break for coming out on a Saturday night I want to preach a message called God's response to the cries of bondage amen God's response to the cries of bondage because when God's people get into a place of bondage he has a specific response to that cry when they cry out when they're in bondage God has a specific response that he gives to that cry but it isn't necessarily the response that you would think it would be a mess let's turn to access chapter 2 hey man I just want to say I enjoy every single time I come to this place hey man so I appreciate everybody having such a welcoming spirit it's always good to be back because here about a year ago I had a awful struggle trying to get here I had to really talk to my flesh this morning and say we're not here to get frustrated that's my flesh fight the flesh was weak and thankfully the Lord gave me a nice long layover in Chicago and I had uh get some things settled out and it's amazing how Laurie is able to turn this around a man we were always our body always seems to want to go some way but God is giving us a position to stand up here above our own selves so when we would start to go the wrong way there's Lois spirit that's not the way to do it go back go back go back towards the vision and there it is amen a mess so exodus chapter 2 will read the 23rd the 24th verse and it says and it came to pass in the process of time that the king of Egypt died and the children of Israel side by reason of the bondage and they cried and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage and God heard their groaning and God remembered his covenant with Abraham and with Isaac and Jacob and God looked upon the children of Israel and God had respect unto them a malicious power has a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord for an evening where we could gather together Lord to you Lord here at the end of the week father that you gave us Lord in the beginning CD to you Father have nine own way Lord take your place a smarter Lord have the preeminence this evening father we give ourselves over to you father for we whatever it is that you had in your mind when you were dying upon that cross Lord that's what we want to be father and we give ourselves over to that tonight Lord in the name of Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seated I think we all remember how the story of how the children of Israel got to be in this position you remember when Joseph was put into prison by his brothers that that uh he was sold into slavery and and they they took him all the way over to Egypt and they put him into slavery in Egypt they end up rise nothing power then he got thrown into prison and then God delivered him with the mighty hand and got enough blessing him and Egypt so much so that the ruler of Egypt said come over here I want to give you a blessing I want to give you a blessing of the land of Goshen and I want to put you in this land I want you to be at peace in this place I want you to have your way in this place but I just want you to cut you know and they were they were given that land of Goshen and it was a blessing to them you remember as Joseph came and he he took his his father and always brethren his family and they all went over to Goshen and they were blessed there amen they they they began to increase and riches amen they they had children and their children's children and their grandchildren amen great-grandchildren and as they grew God just always bless him in that place amen but you know God that was not the land that God had promised to their father Abraham so no matter how much they were being blessed there in Goshen they were not living in the promises of God amen so in the process of time now remember in the process of time that after the the eat that king died there rose up a pharaoh that did not know Joseph amen and that Pharaoh began to get scared about this rich and powerful people over on the borderland over in the well water land of Goshen and so he began to put them into slavery and it is he began to tax them as he began to slowly put the pressure down and slowly I don't know how long it took him but he just I'm sure you know how the devil does he just slowly moves him from peace into bondage he that's that's how it always goes every time Satan is gonna bring you into bond it's always gonna be a slow walk amen you're gonna go from what you think is a land of peace but it's gonna slowly transform into a land of bondage amen and so after 400 years I got to the point where they began to rise we're slaves we're in bondage it's there's something about the human heart that is like yeah I'm not it's not supposed to be like this and there's something about the human spirit that when they catch themselves in that type of a position there's something within them that just rises up and says it's not supposed to be like this you take any man that's sick you know he cries out I there was a time when I used to be well and there's something inside of them that cries out I want to be well again you take someone that gets in a bad situation where they're where they're being abused or or or or whatever it is or they're in a bad spot in their job or they're in debt or something like that there's a cry begins to rise up inside of them because there was a time when they were in that condition and there's a hope inside of them and where they wish they remember what it was like to not be in that type of a bondage and like how do I get back to what the land of Russell how do I get back - there's something to citing Mina's crying out for peace there's crying out for joy that's crying out for a health that's crying out for peace how do I get back to that place amen and so they begin to cry out unto the Lord amen and the Bible says as they began to cry that their cry began to lift up off the earth and it began to enter into the ears of Jehovah amen as soon as the Lord began to consider their the cry of the people his mind drifted back to what the vision was before the foundation of the world his mind began to drift back to what the promise was what is it that I gave what probably is that promise I gave to Abraham what is it the where it was a condition what was the what was my vision say what was what was it that I had in my mind before the foundation of the world and as their cry began to rise up to Jehovah in God's mind we came in mind to deliver them but had a deliverance now now remember their cry would have been something like this Lord bring us back to Goshen Lord let us be back at peace and Goshen Lord take off this bondage from us let's go back to the land where we grew up in Goshen but God wasn't interested in bringing them back to peace and Goshen if God ever once delivers you he's his mind is to deliver you back to what the vision was if God ever once restores you he's not interested in giving you a half-hearted deliverance or a half-hearted restoration if God ever once is going to deliver you or ever what's going to heal you or ever once going to restore you his mind is going to restore you not back to what you want but back to what his vision was before the foundation of the world that is always God's response to the cries of bondage if your if your cry ever gives up to the Lord if your cry enters into his ears he's immediately gonna go back and consider what the promise is over your life amen and yet you might think Oh Lord I just want to be at peace I just want to be do this but I remember God has a vision for your life and he will do whatever it takes to get you back in compliance to that vision amen so because of that God's deliverance is sometimes look mighty strange amen sometimes the way God delivers us a she looks a little strange sometimes it gets worse Amen why because God is not just in a patch up business but God always has in his mind a total deliverance God always that has in his mind a total deliverance he's not interested in giving you a half way deliverance amen living outside of God's promises brings bondage I'm gonna repeat that living outside of God's promises no matter how peaceful it is no matter how wealthy you might see no matter how good you might have it living outside of God's promises brings bondage eventually it's going to happen sure as the world because God had a vision of you from before the foundation of the world and if you are ever catch yourself on the outside of that vision God wants to bring you back to restoration and he will do whatever it takes to get you there amen and let me tell you how God's vision is a beautiful thing God's vision is a beautiful thing it's God's vision that created all the things we enjoy in this world amen everything that we think if you think of all the beautiful pictures you see of all the places you'd love to go amen aim as I love to travel I'd love to see what God has created and every time I go to a new place I think my the beauty the variety of God but yet that same beauty of that same vision that created all that beauty created the vision that's resting upon my life amen and that vision will bring me to a place that's just as beautiful amen now the children of Israel you know they they didn't they didn't you know if they were to write the story themselves they probably wouldn't have written that they are gonna be embodied bondage for 400 years but God was writing a story God's writing a vision think about Jonah whose idea was it for Jonah to be in the belly of a whale it was God's idea now when Jonah was in that belly of the whale I don't know if he really thought too much you know he was in a good place but he was right where God 1 the Bible says that God created a special fish a man God had that in mind amen think about a Hannah Hannah wanted to have a child she had been married so many years and couldn't have any children do you know the Bible says how her womb got closed the Bible says God closed her womb but no God close the womb God closed the womb so what did the word wanted closing Hannah's womb cause it costs a cry it caused a cry and when that cry began to enter into the remember she went into the temple one day and she her in the and she was she had been got she'd gone long enough the cry had a certain pitch she was trusting the Lord so much and she was just crying the Lord and God finally answered her prayer and his mind immediately went back to you what the vision was and the vision was of a special child amen a special child and what to do God gave remember way every time in the Bible when someone couldn't have children when God gave them shorter and he gave them a special child amen my God always wants to bring them back you know you really can never be desperate until you get to a certain point God has to do certain things in your life to cause a desperation Amen but desperation or is the thing that brings you to lay everything aside and not be happy and go amen amen God is determined that will not be happy in Goshen so if you're living in Goshen right now let me tell you God is determined that you're not gonna stay happy in Goshen very long because God has a land of promise every single one of us should have in mind what the promises of God are and have a mind inside of us that cries out when we see things contrary to that vision Amen there's there's just something inside of me that when I see a promise in the word I just I gotta have it I just I cannot rest and tell us I just I want to see this Bible so manifest it you know when I witness you know I just let me just go down this path here for a second when I was when I was going to this particular denominational Church we decide one day that we were going to go door-to-door witnessing and we're gonna go knocking on door to door and I hated talking to people I was not a social person and but yeah they signed me up to go anyway and so I went and you know what I had nothin to say to the people I had never seen God move in my life before and I did not have a witness to testify of and Here I got all these friends I got it delivered them from drugs and deliver us from this and my testimony was I grew up in church you know what's my testimony but you know God eventually down the road showed me what my testimony was and he got to the point now it's where I have seen God do so much that my entire life is trusting in the gospel as someone once asked me not too long ago say well what's your type post what holds you down what do you have to hold on to the gospel I'm a Christian I hold on to the Lord Jesus Christ it's all I have to I just I'm at the point in my life to where that's all I had to hold on to because I know that he has a vision for me that is more beautiful than anything that I could try if I tried to write the story of my life I wouldn't write it as good as he's gonna write it Amen if I was trying to make it a little bit better I couldn't do it amen but God has a vision for us and God has particular ways to get us to enter into that vision let me tell you if you're reading your Bible if you're praying if you're if you're doing the things that are right and you have a desire upon your heart take it to God and prayer because God is a prayer answering God amen I just want let's just take a moment here and let's just go back into the scriptures real quick let's turn over to Romans 8:26 Romans 8:26 and says likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searches the heart knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God a man so this is the process we don't always necessarily know what we ought to pray for I think all of us could say that some guys we have burdens on our heart and we don't necessarily know what the right answer is we'll have something that we desire in our mind questions is this the will of God or not sometimes like like you think of think of your teenage years that's when the you get all these deep desires in your life but you always wonder well should I go this way or should I go that way or you know it's a it's a time of your life to where you're you're always wondering which direction should I go amen and you have these deep desires you know especially at 18 19 20 21 and trying to figure your life out and you have all these deep desires in your life but yet when you lift these this cry up to the Lord Lord take my life over what does the Holy Spirit do he grabs the hold of that cry and he makes intercession for you and he adds his cry to your cry amen and he makes intercession for you according to what the will of God and they all sudden your your prayer gets gets goes right up along the side of the Holy Spirit and he can kind of just grab that prayer and okay and go around the heavens with it amen and all of a sudden he answers that prayer according to the will of God amen let me tell you I had a lot of deep desires things I wanted to do things I wanted to be when I was growing up and God I can say without fail has constantly been answering my prayers throughout my whole life ever since I was a child I started reading my Bible - 13 years old everyday I've read almost every day since I was 13 God has been throughout my life been answering my prayers I've seen it over and over again God has been answering my prayers he's been answering my Christ I know I know that it is possible I know who he is let no man trouble me I've seen Christ in action amen let's start one more scripture here real quick let's go to Exodus chapter 22 X's chapter 22 will read the 22nd verse it says ye shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child if they afflict them in any wise and they cry it all unto me I will surely hear their cry and my wrath shall wax hot and I will kill you with the sword my God's listening to the cries God is still listening to the Christ let me tell you when God's people begin to cry out because in their because they're in bondage doesn't matter what it is whether it be sickness if it's temptation if it's a passion in your life something maybe something you don't even know is right whether it's right or wrong you're not sure but if there is something that's bothering you something that's taking a hold of your mind that has put you in bondage that is taking you away from your focus in life or taking you away from your focus on God whatever it may be either that's not that bad of a thing if something has put you into bondage your cry will go up to the Lord and he'll answer according to his will amen he will always go back to what the vision is an answer according to the will of God he let says God's response is always to go back to his will he's not gonna bring you to Goshen he's not gonna try and give you peace and Goshen but he's gonna find out what's the will for Malachi's life what's the will for phurba livings life what's the will for soma so his life he's always gonna go back and foot look back to what the vision for your life was and he's gonna answer you according to what the vision is I'm glad that he does do that I'm glad that he does do that amen amen you know it's a funny thing about people's whenever they cry out there they almost always they cry out for partial deliverance it's funny how guys people are like that almost every time God's people begin to cry out they almost always cry out for a partial deliverance you know God's not in the business he doesn't provide partial deliverances that's not his business if God is ever gonna deliver you of anything he wants to knock you down and start over from scratch he wants a total deliverance he wants to deliver you so much to the point that you will say there's no way I could deliver myself out of that that was nothing but the hand of the Almighty God amen because God will share his glory with no one amen so when you began crying out to the Lord and things began to look worse in your life don't worry God has God has something in the a in the works but he has this vision in his mind that he's bringing you to so just be patient with him just be patient with him so you don't end up like those are murmured in the wilderness because they may have been crying out oh Lord Goshen was so wonderful we heard the stories of Goshen why are we going this way because there was a promise that God had the way back before the foundation of the world and God was bringing them to that promise Amen it's worth the journey it is worth let me tell you that if you're wore out by the journey through the wilderness it is worth there is a blessing on the other end just be patient just keep going there's a blessing on the other end because God has a perfect response to the cries of bondage and it's to go back to the will of God amen once you get there you'll be you'll be you'll look back you say I'm glad I made it all the way I'm glad I made it to the other side I'm glad I Malad I made it to the Swiss Way amen amen [Music] a man whenever you cry whenever your cry Inter's God's ear the Holy Spirit begins to cry but he only is to go back according to the vision yes I wanted to read this quote a brother brand was coming from a total deliverance he says just like you if you are a Christian God doesn't make any halfway Christians do you believe that God doesn't make halfway Christians a man if you're living in half way kind of life let me tell you God doesn't make you like that amen you're living in bondage to something amen let me tell you if you go on living a half way life he might have to knock you down pretty far to get you out of that thing amen it's not always pretty pretty when someone tries to straddle the fence it's not always pretty when they come out of it okay but they'll get out of it amen God makes complete Christians God don't make halfway preachers but the preacher can be halfway and God makes his children Christians but sometimes they're halfway Christians but it's not God's intention for them to be that way but if they're always got mixed up with the plan of God for their life and that's what makes them the way they are God don't want them to be halfway Christians or halfway preachers compromising on either side he wants them to stand completely in the breech by let me tell you what every time there's some scriptures that I just I just love to focus on you know the scripture where he said where two or three are gathered in my name I'll be right there in the midst of you or that scripture is answered every time we come into this drilling every time we come into this room amen your eyes that he's right here we came into this hurroo in his name Hasini amen and he asked and he has honored that he has honored that scripture he has honored that Scripture he's entered into this a man was he in what'd he say that when he comes into this room what's he gonna do he's gonna be just the same as he was 2,000 years ago a man and what remember what it was the Bible say it the Holy Spirit does he searches the hearts so why do you you came we came into the church too smart another sighting this evening we came into the church this evening we walked through that door there and we began to pray we're going to say Lord I've come into this house in your name in the name of Jesus Christ it brings him on the scene a man where he comes on the scene he comes to be just the same he ever was but what does he do he begins to search your heart he begins brooding over the hearts of everybody in the congregation every church service this process takes place every single service this process takes place he the Holy Spirit begins to brood over the congregation and he knows the conditions of your heart amen now if your condition of your heart is lukewarm he can't deal with you amen but if you come into this place with an honest and sincere heart and you come in here he can and he is also here to be just the same yesterday today and forever amen when he begins to listen to the cry of your heart here in the in the congregation and he begins they listen to the cry of your heart then he begins to make intercession for you according to the will of God amen and that's when heaven begins to move on your behalf Amen that's when things begin to take place when a people in the sincerity of their heart enter into a church service where Christ is on the scene a man he begins to search your heart their most depths he sees what the cry of your heart is amen he begins making her session for you and things begin to happen say brother that happens every church service every church service God is here to be the same without fail every church service he's every day it's called today God is here to be the same amen amen and he's here to make a total deliverance amen we're not here to be halfway Christians amen but we got to be total absolute Christians for his namesake amen amen God's response is always to bring you he has a burden to bring you back to the word a man when he searches your hearts and he sees that you're off the word a little bit he beings cry out for you amen and you and it's your responsibility to lay your life down and go with him in submission back to the vision back to the word Amen he wants to bring you back to compliance to the Word of God amen God is not interested in giving you peace in Egypt amen remember the Bible says if your riches increase set not your heart upon them a man yells things sometimes can get so comfortable in Goshen a man Senayan is what I'm driving down the road you know I was like oh I'm getting a little cold in here and I reach out my hand and I just turn the dial and up with a couple degrees and starting to feel a little bit better you know and I just Mar like Laura we're so so coddled sometimes you know we're just so cozy sometimes like oh it's getting a little warm I can just turn the knob a couple degrees the other way you know or I walk into a room that's darkened and and I just turned the light on and light fills the room but you know and those are just temporary blessings amen because but the vision is is that we're going to a city where the lamb is like a man so no matter how much we enjoy the light switch on the wall we're not here to enjoy the life switch unless it's a temporary blessing that's a blessing of goshen we're going to a city where the lamb is the light amen we're going to a city where it's 72 degrees all the time amen we're going to a city where where we don't need to control the temperature amen God's got it all under control amen we're going to a city where God said before you cry out to me I will answer my won't that be a blessing Amen right now we cry out why we get off the word we're going down this way God has something he wants to teach us something he wants to show us and he's gotta get our mind off the world long enough and by getting them maybe into bondage of something maybe a little get a little bit over on this way or a little this way because yes our mind has to get just like Hannah's guy get your mind on something and the the cry has to he reach a certain pitch and all sudden God moves on the scene a man there we get to see him in action all over again a man so don't don't worry when you see yourself getting into these situations don't you know don't know fret don't despair don't count it like Oh Lord I'm law so just say Lord I'm gonna start crying out to you all over again Oh Lord Here I am again Lord once more entering into my prayer closet Lord I don't know what happens somehow I got off over here again Lord somehow I got off over here again Lord I didn't mean to Lord I didn't want to be over here Lord it seems like maybe Laodicea got me again over here a little bit Lord but Lord I'm crying back to you Lord I'm coming back to you and Lord it and I'm Lord might let my cry enter into your ears and let me know when it gets to that point oh my things are getting ready to happen because the thing of it is is you might have something in your mind that you want to get back to a certain type of deliverance but God has something in his mind you have even considered a man and that cry is gonna start some processes in motion that you can't even imagine what they are let me tell you when God's children were crying to go back to peace and Goshen they couldn't even vision the blessings of Solomon's Temple let me tell you there's no way they could have thought about the blessings of the cloud coming down there's no way they could have thought of the blessings of Joshua sitting there at the tabernacle outside the outside the campus as the president law came down in a field the place there's no way they could consider that but you know and those things are so much better than Goshen why wouldn't you have liked to have been there when Solomon was dedicating the temple well he began cry now and he said Oh Lord I am dedicating this place to you it seems like such a small thing for a people to create a house for God a dwelling when God he doesn't even dwell in houses you made the earth and here we and our futile attempts tried to create a house for you but nevertheless Lord here we've created this house for you and Lord nanus and saltless of Solomon's cry to the to the Lord was Lord if any of your people ever have a need I pray father that they could walk through the doors of this place if they walk through the doors of this place and they have respect unto your name in the name of Jehovah and they get down to this altar and they cry out to you Lord I pray Lord that you would hear from heaven and answer their prayer and in Solomon's he said in furthermore Lord I pray father that even if a stranger from another land comes to this place now if he would just come into this house even though he be a stranger if you just come into this house and have respects under the name of Jehovah and cry out to you at this altar Lord that you hear from heaven an answer is prayer I pray Lord you would hear him and heal his land when they were in Goshen they couldn't fathom that and let me tell you and neither can we when we're living in a lukewarm condition neither we can we fathom a time in our lives where all we have to do is just close her eyes and cry out and God answers our prayer like that can you imagine that but God has it free God has that for me God has a walk for you brother Branham said that the disciples knew that way of living Twitter is just one little nod from the Lord and there go about his business with that is that a good place to be in one little nod from the Lord wake up in the morning Lord Here I am your righteous servant father I've washed my sins in your blood Lord I've tried to keep my life clean the best I know how and Laura de here is another morning and I am sacrificing my life again Lord I am here to be at your service let that cry in it up to the Lord what could he do with that and all sudden that cry it starts going up to before the altar Lord and it goes up where the blood Glamis makes intercession for all your faults and failures oh my and then god doesn't even see your faults and failures anymore and the Holy Spirit grabs a hold that cry and he starts moving on your behalf and he and God looks back oh what's the vision four four four four sister Wendy's life and he looks back he sees what that vision is that's there's the vision there's something waiting for her in the wings maybe as I grab ahold of your life and steer you that direction and when the thing comes to place it's more beautiful in the mountains of Colorado it's more beautiful in the oceans of the South Pacific a man why because it's the perfect will of God for your life amen amen God has a walk for you amen but when we began to cry out to the Lord God and mediate connect cry causes God to go back and review the vision for your life I'm gonna repeat what we said in the beginning God's response to the cries of bondage is to go back and review the vision he has for your life and it's your cry that causes that review so if you would like to if you've been living a lukewarm Laodicean life if you--if when you read revelations 3:14 where he says that you know that there are lukewarm they're cold there or they're not caught they're not cold he wants to spew them out of their mouth there they're comfortable they're enjoying their riches they it's been a while they're not praying like they used to they're not witnessing they don't enjoy the joy the Lord as their strength anymore when people get to that condition that's not God's vision for your life but when you get to that condition and you begin crying out to the Lord all sudden that cry starts a chain of events and let me tell you you just keep crying out to Lord and that chain of events will the high Sparrow come up on your side and pull you back into the vision of God it's a beautiful thing since I've seen it over and over in my life it's a beautiful thing boys spare you've been crying out for a while and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit just comes up by your side and he turns you like oh that's the way I'm supposed to go and there you are back on the path back going towards the vision of the Almighty God and a little while down the road you look back you think oh my you know the Bible or a brother man says you know sometimes you have to do something for God to honor a man sometimes you just have to do something for God honor you know and all of us we get to that point in our lives where we at we just have to do something to give God honor the other is lose there's times in my life where if I need a response from God there's just little things I do there little tokens I have in my own life to where I do them for the Lord because lord I need an answer from you and there's little things that I do that because like Lord when I do this I am entering into your presence father Lord when I'm doing this I'm looking only towards you you know sometimes I'll just paste about the floor with my the Bible to my face cuz lord I am focusing on your word alone Lord you know I just have little things idea why because I'm always wanting to bring my just let's do something that God can honor do a little something that God can are a little token of me because God gives us tokens we can give God tokens Amen God gave us a token of the Holy Ghost which is a down payment of the future home right amen and we can give God tokens of a little surrender over here amen are a little surrender over here Laura give this little little I'm gonna give a blessing to this person over here Lord because I need a blessing over here amen amen Lord I need this over here so I'm going to be a blessing to that over this person over there amen I need help of my life song I pray for brother so-and-so in his life hey man I'm gonna do this Lord so that you can honor give give respect to the honor I give to someone else a man sometimes you have to do something for God to honor so if you find yourself where your prayers are always selfish it's good to do that so that God has something that he can respond to something that he can honor amen amen amen I'm air one time I had a need of we didn't have a lot of money and I had a little bit and I knew someone needed money more than me I knew they wouldn't receive it and so I got together with them and and I just put a little bit of money in an envelope and I and I knew that there was no way they would ever receive it they were the type of person they would just throw on the ground if you try to give it to him you know they just there's no way they would receive it and so I met him for for dinner one time and I asked him I said how much did Christ's death cost what did it cost him it cost him everything he had a right to keep on living and he gave up his rights it cost him everything I said I said brother have you received the life of Christ he says yes I said have you received the blood of Christ for your sins he said yes I said don't you realize that that costs him everything and you're just taking it and he said yes I said well here I'll this is just a little token if you can accept the blood of Christ you can receive this and he couldn't refuse couple weeks later someone sideswiped my car but the damage was so minor that it wasn't even worth bothering about and I was trying to get the person just to drive off and they wouldn't do it they insisted on calling the police it was their fault and so they called the police and then I just let it go and then but she had my phone number little while they're there insurance agent called me one look at my car I said well it's not that much damage to it and so he comes he look at my car and he totals it out gives me a check for the entire car and after a winter of rain all the ski those few scuff marks on the side and after a winter rain they all had washed away without having me doing anything the the doors bent and I took my hand I pulled out and it like popped right back in place he could even tell they ever bend in it and and after about six months a demon looked like it ever been hit and the search search agent and the Mel was about 150 percent away just given to the brother week before but I knew someone I needed it something but I knew someone they needed something a little bit more amen I did something for God to honor and sometimes we I do just do a little something for God to honor a man give a little prayer for somebody else go to the go to your prayer closet for half an hour for somebody else do something for to honor for somebody else so the God could have respect to you amen and as you do for someone else God will do for you amen amen but if you have something in your life a deep bird in your life give it to the Lord just keep crying out and when your cry reaches that certain pitch he always answers I've seen it without fail when the people begin to cry out before Lord telling me search the Old Testament search the New Testament when men and women were crying out to God what always happens God answers isn't that the pattern do you think that after 6,000 years of God answering people he's gonna quit with you no no he's gonna keep on listening amen and remember once you begin crying out to the Lord when your cry hits that certain pitch it starts a chain of events that cannot be stopped say brother cannot be stopped now think about it think about the charter of Israel living in Goshen did they try to stop the chain of events how much idolatry between was there between them and the promised land how many golden calves how much idol worship how much foolishness how many sacrifices how many adulteries did they commit how much turning around how much crying out for Egypt did they do but yet their cry that they cried back in Egypt started a chain of events and action that could not be stopped a man and I want to tell you Saints they're crying out to God we'll start a chain of events in your life that cannot be stopped but that chain that but that response is not necessarily what you think it's gonna be that response is gonna be back to what the will of God is for your life hey man I hope that's what you want because I think that's what you're gonna get amen that's what you're gonna get amen and I'm glad that he does that it takes all the guesswork out of it a man it takes all the guesswork out because I don't necessarily know what God has for me the rest of my life I don't really know I never I never once in my life pictured me where I am today and I know 10 years from now I'll be somewhere like a man imagine right now but I do know one thing that placed my life in the hands of the Lord a man so I know whatever does happen it's in his hands amen amen and whatever comes to me upon life's journey I'm just gonna place my concerns upon the altar of the Lord and I'm gonna keep placing them there and if I any need I have upon life's journey I just place it upon the altar of the Lord and I cry out to him and I know that he'll answer me according to Romans chapter 8 the Holy Spirit will cry out with me and he will hijack my prayer and bring her right back into compliance with the will of God isn't that beautiful God can hijack your prayers yes that's what Romans what we read there in Romans 8 God will hijack your prayer let's turn back there I'm not gonna be much longer here Saints but let's just turn back to that I want to read it again I think it bears repeating Romans 8:26 it says likewise the spirit also helps our infirmities amen whatever is wrong with you the hit on the Holy Spirit here is to help you amen because why why because we do not why is he help us and tell us helping ourselves because we don't know how we should pray as we should we just don't know so what does he do it doesn't mean we should stop praying we keep on praying but the Holy Spirit joins himself to our prayer and he makes intercession for us and now it's not just us praying but he's praying with us and his prayer goes up to heaven with our prayer Wow isn't that powerful his prayer goes up to heaven where took with his with our prayer and where does that prayer go it goes up to the altar where the blood of the Lamb is and the blood of the land was sacrificed for the answer for your prayer a man so don't ever doubt that God hears your prayers because the blood of the Lamb gave God permission to hear your prayer amen the blood of the Lamb gave God permission to hear your cry amen and so when you're and when you cry the OI spirit's prayer joins up with your prayer goes up to the altar where the blood of lamb is and he makes intercession for you what according to what the vision of God is for your life and it starts a chain of events in your life that cannot be stopped it's beautiful let me say it to the young children it's beautiful to the teenagers it's beautiful yes just keep watching just keep reading just keep praying if you have something that you want in life put it upon the altar Lord I'm placing this prayer upon the altar Lord I got this desire in my life I don't know if it's in your will or not Lord but I got this desire and I don't know what to do with it so I'm just gonna place it upon the altar Lord I'm gonna see how you answer it Lord this I'm putting it at your mercy Lord answer it according to your will Oh God let it start that chain of events sometimes I give God a little bit of that little gods waiting for you to do something like that so he can move alongside and join his prayer with yours you have to give God you have to do something for God to honor a man why so that he can get the glory so when you bring the testimony later on amen I cried to the Lord and he heard my cry and delivered me amen as Noah says in the Psalms over and over and over again God heard my cry God heard my cry amen amen God doesn't make halfway Christians he makes total Christians a man they cry out for a total deliverance amen nothing less but a total deliverance amen amen amen like Joby the end result is your situation might get worse but in the end it'll be a promised land it'll be the promised land hey man I just I want to close here on this one scripture I know I I think I've read this a few times when I come here but I want to read Psalms 18 again I think I probably read this Psalm almost every time I come I don't know but this all means a lot for me because I have a lot of testimonies I have a lot of testimonies of times when God heard my prayer and my brother even testified though just a little bit ago in the office there about how last time I was here we were sharing some testimonies and and he took one of those testimonies he had a situation it was similar in his life and so he my prayer gave him permission to pray the same way sometimes we need that we hear a brother or sister that prays and gets a certain response like oh my I didn't know I could ask for that I think I'll ask for that amen and and so he prayed the same prayer and the same prayer work for him too amen amen this here is one of my favorite Psalms in the Bible Psalms 18 it means a lot to me because in verse 6 there it has one verse where David describes his prayer in verse an 18-6 there says in my distress I called upon the Lord and cried unto my God and he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry came before him even into his ears and one thing I want you to know about this scripture is every single one of us has to have the exact same faith that when you pray the same thing happens to your prayer every single one of us has to have that same faith that when you pray your prayer when it leaves your lips it doesn't stop at the roof but it goes into the temple of the Most High God and enters into the ears of the Lord Amen and it causes him to look back to the vision for your life amen and so one little verse there describes David's prayer but the next I think it's the next eleven verses describe God's reaction what the next 11 verses say this is God's reaction in verse 7 to David's little prayer it says and then the earth shook and trembled the foundations of the hills were moved and were shaken because he was wroth there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and fire of his mouth devour colt coals were kindled by it he bowed the heavens also and came down and darkness was under his feet he did ride upon shara but he did fly yeah he flew upon the wings of the wind he made darkness his secret place his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of skies and brightness was before him his sick clouds passed hail stones and coals of fire and the Lord also thundered in the heavens and the highest gave his voice hail stones and coals of fire yeah he sent out his arrows and scattered them he shot out lightnings and discomfort of them now think about us Saints he's still this is just an answer Davis prayer this is how a guys are spying to what David needed you imagine you're a little prayer having God respond in this way to one of your prayers it can happen God will move heaven and earth for you because you are his son and daughter amen and then the channels of the waters were seeing the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke O Lord at that at the blast of the breath of the nostrils he sent from above he took me he drew me out of many waters he delivered me I love this verse here he delivered me from my strong enemy and from them which hated me for they were too strong for me and that little thing and it keeps going on and on and on Saints you can just keep you can read that one he at home but that is God's response this big long multi-verse response to this one little one verse prayer I cried unto the Lord and my prayer went up into his temple and God came down on the scene for my behalf every single one of us if we're going to be a Christian has to have this testimony they've been something that God did for us that we could not do for ourselves where God came down and heard our prayer and sometimes you know like Jonah I love Jonah sometimes I like to think of myself kind of like Jonah you know can you imagine Jonah he knew he was a prophet of the Most High God he knew that God spoke to him he heard things that nobody else heard he heard the voice of God for his age Amen well that's a powerful thing but instead of going the way the voice of God said he went the other way how would you feel in that situation Lord why can't I be as faithful as Enoch Lord why can't I be as faithful as Moses or why can't I be more like Abraham I could just hear Jonah no Laura why can't why is it when you say to go this way I go that way and Harry enters into the ship and the storm starts raging and he's like and he's telling the men that are sailing the boat he says all of this guy's is because of me guys angry with me and I'm like well what did you do to make the God of heaven upset and he says I was just so goddamn Ile if tear and I disobeyed him I wouldn't he said to go right I don't know what left however many people hear the voice of God but he was the one that heard it and he was disobedient to it and so he says the God of heaven is Rossa me bind me up and cast me into the sea and the Seas will become calm as glass a man so they banging up his hands behind his back and they throw him into the sea and they say Oh Lord God forgive us we wash our hands of this man a man as he sinks us God prepares a special fish and he's in the belly of the fish for three days and three nights and you know what as much as Jonah thought he was like Lord why am i this such a disobedient prophet God made that disobedient prophet a type in a shadow of the most obedient to be ever be done upon the earth when Jesus Christ went willingly to the cross sacrifice 33 years of his life never once committing a sin though he was tempted constantly have you ever been tempted so much so you just gave in he just gave in and the temptation went away because you gave in to it you have a little bit of momentary reprieve from your temptation because you gave in to it jesus never did that suffered 33 years of his life suffering through temptation after temptation temptation after temptation never once giving in my the most obedient is says face like a flint to the cross obedient to the end laid down his life he said as Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights so shall the Son of Man be in the belly of the earth because I'm gonna let a type I'm gonna let the most disobedient prophet be a shadow a type of the most obedient act poor Jonah didn't know I don't think he knew at that time and what he was doing was typing out the most obedient air act ever to be done upon the earth so don't be discouraged just keep following the Lord if you're in bondage to something if you're doing something you shouldn't be doing lay it upon the altar cry out to him lay it upon the altar say Lord deliver me Lord set me free from this I want to get back to where you are back to where the will of God is from and that cry will enter up into the heavens a man and God will respond to make a heavy response in your behalf amen and bring you back to the vision that he had of your life before the foundation of the world amen if God has ever once tugged at your hearts door Amen then he has a vision for your life respond quickly to him run after him cry unto Him Amen so with that vision so you can start that chain of events circling whirling controlling your life amen and pretty soon you'll ended up with at a point in your life in the promised land where you're seeing the promises of God being manifest over here and over there the grapes are growing up over here a man the land of milk and honey and you'll be like oh my I am so glad I entered into the promises of the Most High God and I'm so glad I didn't stay in Goshen I'm so glad I laid my Blyth upon the altar amen amen why because God has a plan for your life amen but it takes that little cry to start that chain of events whirling over your life Amen so don't worry just keep crying under the Lord you can be and have that strong faith that you know exactly where your prayer goes when you pray amen he will answer you amen he is up there waiting for your cry amen amen he is waiting for your crime Amen let's just stand amen every one of us has a blueprint for our life amen amen let's just Bauer has a word of Prayer Heavenly Father you have been so good to us your mercy is without end father lord I just thank you so much Lord you've been so careful or to consider us father to look upon our ways Lord put us in places in our life sometimes this even dark places Lord by Lord the purpose of God Stan sure they no matter where we are in our life's journey here we get to in our life we know that we are just one cry away and when we begin to lay those cries upon the altar Lord that the Holy Spirit searches the hearts as search our heart also he did miss us he searched the heart of our neighbors to skip over us [Music] he searched every door of our heart the condition of our life and when we turn our face towards Lord Jesus Christ the veil is removed begin to see the revelation of Lord Jesus Christ as that heart turns towards the Lord and that veil gets removed we see the sunshine of his glory we cry out to him crying into tears Lord safe Oh Lord deliver me O Lord wash me cleanse me or set me free or take these things out of my life lord I don't want to do this anymore I don't wanna do that anymore I don't want to be a peaceful ocean father I don't wanna be in bondage of Egypt forehead I don't want to circle the wilderness father I won't be living to land he promised my father turn me Lord and then all sudden the Holy Spirit sees that cry three sevens he just joins up alongside of him and he opens his mouth he be his daughter out was groaning sex not be understood I know those those groanings hit her into the ears of Lord they join your cry with his cry and they come across the ultimate lot of labels [Music] it is your desire I got strong [Music] [Music] [Music] he's anointed the light the open to the prison to them that are bound to bind up the brokenhearted set at liberty
