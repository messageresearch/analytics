[0:02] probably something contagious so we
[0:03] don't want to spread
[0:07] people just want to be cautious about
[0:10] that Revelation 2 Verse
[0:17] 6 Revelation 2 Verse
[0:22] 6 I was kind of feeling then you know to
[0:25] study on this topic I like to preach on
[0:27] overcoming the Deeds of the nians I like
[0:29] toach that you know Cam and Simon spent
[0:31] a lot of time on that and then I got a
[0:33] questiona had a question about it so I
[0:35] thought I'll just preach out it I've
[0:36] already been studying on it to make a
[0:38] video about it I'd like to make a video
[0:39] on this topic just try to make it as
[0:41] simple as possible um so I'd like to
[0:45] preach on that I want to preach on the
[0:46] positive element of it that we overcome
[0:49] these deeds and doctrines basically it's
[0:52] just overcoming the Antichrist Spirit
[0:54] which we do every day hallelujah how
[0:56] many Overcomers we got out there praise
[0:57] God Amen Hallelujah so it's be little
[0:59] bit review you know maybe hopefully a
[1:01] few new things will be shared with you
[1:02] you know uh hope you'll be blessed um I
[1:06] just want to you I got an email for
[1:08] brother William Brother William sent
[1:11] Jose a text and then sent me a greeting
[1:14] through Jose so I email brother William
[1:15] and he said says these nice things and
[1:18] then he says thank you for raising all
[1:20] those little children that were born in
[1:21] the church to the glory of God and he
[1:24] says he says I urge you therefore he
[1:28] said to endure all things for the sake
[1:30] of these children that they also May
[1:32] obtain the Salvation which is in Christ
[1:34] Jesus with eternal glory
[1:37] amen that
[1:39] next he says I'm trusting God to grant
[1:42] me permission to visit you people
[1:44] again the face of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:46] shine upon you all Shalom he says I
[1:48] thought I'd in that reading
[1:50] there nice to think of our
[1:52] brother Hallelujah thankful for God's
[1:55] grace Hallelujah so Revelation 26 and7 I
[1:59] thought it was very fitting you know
[2:01] these two verses go together you know
[2:03] it's just really striking to think about
[2:05] this Jesus hates Deeds of the Nick hates
[2:09] it but he loves worship you he loves
[2:12] your Praises he loves your prayers amen
[2:15] but he hates you know U he hates false
[2:17] doctrines is basically what the
[2:19] scripture says but then he tells us that
[2:21] we can overcome and we're thankful that
[2:23] we're Overcomers today as I studying
[2:25] this topic I was so blessed to see that
[2:27] we are not partaking these false
[2:31] doctrines we're thankful for the grace
[2:33] of God and the fact that we have pure
[2:36] doctrines proves that we have both the
[2:38] father and the son yes that's what the
[2:40] scripture says how many grateful to have
[2:43] Jesus I have him and he has me am
[2:46] Hallelujah I am my beloved my beloved is
[2:49] mine Jesus Is Mine amen Jesus is yours

[4:08] I'm looking forward a few days
[4:10] off me take a couple naps by God's grace
[4:13] they had a good time the youth had a
[4:15] good time at the service on Sunday
[4:17] night got home about 12:05 I waited up
[4:20] for them so they had a good Fellowship
[4:23] afterwards all said they really like the
[4:25] sermon brother preached from what I
[4:28] understand it was really good preaching
[4:29] God's gra brother Sanger from
[4:31] Pennsylvania so I don't know him but
[4:32] maybe I'll pray about having him out
[4:34] here sometime so I want to look at
[4:36] overcoming the Deeds of niol I have uh
[4:38] some quotes and I actually took a nap
[4:41] yesterday so I stayed up a little later
[4:42] to study so I had a nice a lot of time
[4:44] to kind of get my thoughts ready like I
[4:46] said I've already been studying and
[4:47] thinking on this you know as I go
[4:50] through about my week and everything
[4:51] like that I just kind of when I think of
[4:53] a thought I just kind of em email myself
[4:54] the thoughts so my email inbox has all
[4:56] my thoughts for all the sermons and I
[4:59] can just them off there and kind of put
[5:00] them in these slides and uh just present
[5:03] it hopefully in a clear simple way
[5:05] hopefully it's uh very clear for you to
[5:07] understand by God's grace so I want to
[5:09] make this as clear as possible
[5:10] overcoming uh the Deeds of nians
[5:12] basically just means overcoming any
[5:14] false Antichrist teachings that's
[5:17] basically the the simplistic or the
[5:20] simplistic way to say it we read our
[5:22] text you know here's a simple summary
[5:24] this is from my 2021 book I wrote this
[5:26] but in the Ephesian age Jesus says he
[5:28] and the true V
[5:30] hate the Deeds of the nians and you'll
[5:32] see why in a little bit you'll see why I
[5:34] think I have uh n or 12 or 13 examples
[5:37] of Deeds of nickolus and then remember
[5:40] I'm going to review those nine doctrines
[5:43] of devils that I preached last year
[5:46] remember those I've show nine doctrines
[5:47] of
[5:48] devils um so you see why Jesus hates
[5:51] these things because they they take away
[5:53] from his glory they take away from his
[5:55] leadership
[5:57] okay remember we're not in that group so
[5:59] we're not going to we're not going to
[6:01] feel discouraged tonight we're going to
[6:02] be encouraged Hallelujah and Jesus has
[6:04] kept us from these things Hallelujah
[6:06] remember he keeps us from the evil one
[6:08] he keeps us from falling Hallelujah he
[6:11] keeps us in his nail scarred hand
[6:12] hallelujah we're in his grip tonight
[6:14] hallelujah
[6:16] amen so U the word Deeds is defined as
[6:19] Acts or undertaking so any act in the in
[6:22] a church any undertaking somebody takes
[6:24] up by the Antichrist spirit is a deed of
[6:26] a
[6:27] niad all right so one time you know I
[6:29] told you about this story you know
[6:30] somebody left our church and they said
[6:32] well I'm going to come up and I'm going
[6:33] to come back brother Jesse and I'm going
[6:34] to said he said I'm going to take that
[6:36] mic and I'm going to tell people that
[6:38] the rapture's already happened and you
[6:39] don't need to tithe and I said no you're
[6:41] not don't come to church if you're going
[6:43] to do that well that was if he would
[6:45] have said that and spread that he would
[6:46] have been spreading a deed of a nician
[6:49] because it's
[6:50] Antichrist it's anti Antichrist to say
[6:52] you don't have to pay ties and offerings
[6:53] that's Antichrist right I wasn't about
[6:55] to let him do that okay that's just
[6:58] common sense you know but I can let the
[7:00] Antichrist Spirit speak to us and we can
[7:03] absolutely help it right so any
[7:05] undertaking of Satan is a as a deed of a
[7:09] nician and they they often start as
[7:12] common just undetected Traditions or
[7:14] deeds that people do but they later
[7:16] advance and they become official
[7:18] Universal doctrines as we see in the uh
[7:21] pergan Church age and of course in the
[7:24] uh Ephesus
[7:25] for I'm sorry I forgot now saman I
[7:29] forgot
[7:30] sorry Ephesus subna peros
[7:33] thra sorry I got a little sickness I'm
[7:35] bound myself here so pardon me um but in
[7:39] the first church age Satan deceived lots
[7:41] of immature Believers with seemingly
[7:44] harmless Deeds as we'll see you know
[7:46] some people might say oh it's okay if
[7:48] they do that you know that's just their
[7:49] Liberty but if it's of Satan it's
[7:51] actually not a liberty it's a sin if
[7:53] it's of Satan so there's a difference
[7:55] between a liberty and then a deenul
[7:58] they're not the same
[8:00] Liberties are things that don't make us
[8:01] more holy don't make us less holy but
[8:03] Deeds of nicians make us sinful and I'll
[8:07] show you the examples here as we get
[8:08] this but I just want to put a clear
[8:10] understanding There Brother Marlin God
[8:11] bless you sir good to see you here
[8:12] tonight Hallelujah God bless you and
[8:15] also from my book I wrote now that's
[8:17] just the D's now the word
[8:19] nitin uh it either refers to a heretical
[8:22] group who found a man named Nicholas but
[8:24] I only found one resource on
[8:27] that or is a general term meaning to uh
[8:31] the Antichrist Spirit kind of like
[8:33] Jezebel right Jezebel in the New
[8:34] Testament wasn't a woman named Jezebel
[8:36] it was a spirit that was like the
[8:37] Jezebel from the Old
[8:39] Testament so either Nicholas was a real
[8:41] man in the first church age that
[8:44] conquered the leoty or it's just naming
[8:46] the Antichrist spirit that was working
[8:48] amongst the people we don't know for
[8:50] sure brother says he doesn't know for
[8:51] sure in the church age book but the word
[8:54] Nicholas means Victor of the people and
[8:57] that's where brother R gets the idea of
[8:59] of Conquering the Ley defeating the
[9:02] Ley all right and so I wrote in my book
[9:05] that Satan would get victory over the
[9:07] people through religious leaders who
[9:09] would be legalizing sinful deeds in
[9:12] churches so it would be preachers that
[9:14] legalize sin oh it's okay if you do that
[9:17] but in the whole scheme of themes it
[9:19] wasn't okay it was
[9:22] sin
[9:23] okay um but remember the progression of
[9:26] sin is always so deceptive yeah first
[9:29] first that people are tempted and
[9:31] they're drawn away by their own lust and
[9:33] they're enticed by it so tempted enticed
[9:37] and then lust is conceived and it brings
[9:40] forth sin and then sin ultimately leads
[9:42] to death so this is the four-step
[9:45] process of sin okay I'm sure you're
[9:49] familiar with it now another summary
[9:50] from me we basically overcome the
[9:53] Antichrist false doctrines remember the
[9:56] the Deeds are the first step of false
[9:58] religion
[9:59] right the Deeds are the first step the
[10:01] second step is where it actually becomes
[10:02] a Doctrine an official teaching in a
[10:05] church
[10:07] okay but we overcome all this by the
[10:10] anointing of the Holy Ghost which in our
[10:12] age has the attribute of a flying eagle
[10:15] so we're supposed to be able to fly up
[10:16] in spiritual places right Heavenly
[10:18] places that's why I always forget what
[10:20] time it is when I'm preaching that's why
[10:22] I always want to sing another song they
[10:24] just fly up in Heavenly places right
[10:28] just I just way I look at the Bible says
[10:30] we're seated in Heavenly places right so
[10:32] once we finally get to our seat it's
[10:34] hard to leave that spot hallelujah amen
[10:37] but we overcome the Antichrist by that
[10:39] anointing and that anointing it discerns
[10:41] good and evil in our daily lives and we
[10:43] choose to do the good amen remember all
[10:46] of our doctrines and our Traditions
[10:48] Traditions aren't bad as long as they
[10:50] don't break the word of God that's what
[10:52] the Bible says in two places it's okay
[10:54] to have Traditions remember because
[10:56] Traditions are they're just a shadow of
[10:58] Christ
[11:00] any tradition you have is just a shadow
[11:02] of Christ like brother BR putting up a
[11:03] Christmas tree brother BR wasn't sinning
[11:05] when he put up a Christmas tree the tree
[11:07] reminded him of Christ because Christ is
[11:09] a tree amen
[11:12] hallelujah but if you put up that tree
[11:14] thinking about Santa Claus well yeah
[11:15] that's a sin that's giving sa Satan or
[11:19] uh that's worshiping an idol right
[11:22] something that's not even real it's a
[11:23] lie and God's not into lies amen when
[11:26] the brother ra set up his tree you know
[11:28] and he was worshiping Jesus and you know
[11:30] uh you know enjoying just some family
[11:32] time and excited to you know worship and
[11:34] give his present or children gifts
[11:36] there's nothing wrong with that it's
[11:38] just a liberty it's just a tradition but
[11:41] the reality is that Christ is here today
[11:44] as the real Christmas present praise you
[11:46] get the Christmas present on
[11:48] Thanksgiving night hallelujah thank you
[11:51] Lord hallelujah that's the Holy Ghost
[11:53] praise God Amen thank you Jesus so you
[11:56] see there it's okay to have Traditions
[11:57] as long as they don't cont God's word
[12:00] Paul says that
[12:02] twice you can have a tradition by the
[12:04] word or you can have a tradition just by
[12:06] a spoken word or just a say and that's
[12:08] in uh uh 2 Thessalonians 2:15 we looked
[12:11] at that a few weeks ago so for us we got
[12:13] to keep Galatians 51 stand fast in the
[12:16] Liberty where with Christ has made us
[12:18] free and do not be entangled again with
[12:21] the Lo yoke of bondage yes I wrote the I
[12:24] typed the wrong word that should be
[12:25] again not
[12:27] against now in context Paul was telling
[12:30] them don't go back to circumcision you
[12:32] left that don't go back into that now
[12:35] for us it's don't go back into any Creed
[12:38] of man amen or any Tradition now those
[12:40] of us that were in denominations know
[12:42] that now even our saints that were
[12:44] raised in mess churches they might have
[12:45] had some doctrines that were maybe off
[12:47] the word they don't they don't want to
[12:48] go into that I don't know if they did
[12:50] but if they did they would know I
[12:53] wouldn't know we weren't there at their
[12:55] churches but I know in the mess of
[12:57] churches I I was in I can I can see a
[12:59] couple Traditions that I didn't agree
[13:01] with that maybe we're off the word of
[13:03] God right I could I could see
[13:06] that and so we want you know we're not
[13:08] perfect here we Pro I'm sure we have
[13:10] some faults at some point no doubt but
[13:13] we got to just keep our spiritual eyes
[13:16] open we got to keep that eye s so we can
[13:18] see our lives praise God Satan doesn't
[13:20] blind us right we don't want to be
[13:22] blinded to sin we want to recognize sin
[13:24] we want to confess it and we want a
[13:25] clean church before God Amen amen so we
[13:29] must stand fast in the liberty and not
[13:32] be entangled in
[13:34] legalism all right now the origin of
[13:36] course is what Jesus
[13:38] said basically you know he says he says
[13:41] You must keep your first love right amen
[13:45] and he says if you don't you're fall
[13:47] you're going to fall uh he says but keep
[13:49] your first love do your first Works
[13:51] always try to live your life like you
[13:53] just gotten the messag amen amen you
[13:55] just got saved try to keep that same
[13:57] fervency that same love for
[14:00] godj Lord Jesus and we know in Ephesus
[14:03] they did it I think they lasted I forget
[14:04] how many years they lasted 30 or 50
[14:06] years and then God Jesus took all the
[14:09] churches out of Ephesus and destroyed
[14:10] the city right now it's rebuilt today
[14:13] but the old part from the Bible days
[14:15] that's that's all in Ruins you can visit
[14:17] some of the places there you know it's
[14:19] but they're in Ruins so in other words
[14:20] they didn't repent all the way so Jesus
[14:22] removed all the candlesticks Jesus
[14:24] removed all the Believers out of Ephesus
[14:26] and that's what God would do to churches
[14:27] today Message Church church if they
[14:29] don't repent God will take the real
[14:30] Believers out of there and he leave them
[14:32] in their Creeds and and dogmas that's
[14:35] right right they'll say just say what
[14:36] the tapes say or they say brother Ram
[14:38] already brother Ram is is Jesus they'll
[14:40] baptize in brother Ram's name or they're
[14:42] looking for brother Ram to return so
[14:44] they can have Rapture in faith you need
[14:45] the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost will
[14:47] give you Rapture in
[14:48] [Music]
[14:50] faith and so then after Jesus gives that
[14:52] warning he says but then he says I hate
[14:54] these deeds in nius I hate false
[14:56] doctrines in other words that's quite
[14:59] statement we don't want to do anything
[15:01] that Jesus hates we want to do things
[15:02] Jesus
[15:04] loves Jesus hates Antichrist teachings
[15:07] and because they're actually spiritual
[15:09] adultery right because spiritual
[15:11] adultery is any false Doctrine brother R
[15:13] tells us it's loving sin and then
[15:15] someone has left the first love if they
[15:18] have a deed of nickol they've left the
[15:20] word and this is no longer good enough
[15:21] now I got to have some lust of the flesh
[15:23] lust of some pride of life I got to have
[15:25] some part of worship that I want to have
[15:27] part of worship all
[15:30] right and so uh I'm just again uh
[15:33] summarizing here now I've already read
[15:36] that I just that that's a repeat up
[15:37] there now remember it's important to
[15:39] notice Jesus explains the evil
[15:41] progression of the Deeds the Deeds
[15:43] they're just they're just Traditions
[15:45] they mature to false doctrines where
[15:46] then the preachers they got all their
[15:48] scriptures to teach that their that
[15:49] their false doctrines right
[15:53] okay brother R said when it becomes a
[15:55] Doctrine it becomes an unbending way the
[15:57] preacher say either my way or the
[15:59] highway that's right with the false
[16:02] Doctrine now it's okay to say it's God's
[16:04] way or the highway that's okay to say
[16:06] God's word is the way if you don't want
[16:08] like that you can go you can leave the
[16:09] Highway of Holiness amen it's God's way
[16:12] or the leave the highway I'll say it
[16:14] like that the third step is bism which
[16:17] is uniting with false
[16:19] Believers right what did balum do balum
[16:21] led the Israelites to B peor where they
[16:23] had adulteries right where they had
[16:26] idolatrous religion they had a feast of
[16:27] Bor
[16:29] so it's basically Fellowship uh false
[16:31] Fellowship of false Unity with
[16:34] unbelievers and the last step is Jezebel
[16:37] religion right which is called the
[16:39] depths of Satan so there's four steps
[16:42] right to the depths of satanic religion
[16:45] and we know the Catholic church is the
[16:46] depths of Satan amen right so picture
[16:49] that you know the Catholic church is the
[16:51] depths of that okay so what's the step
[16:53] before that maybe other denominations
[16:55] that aren't as as quite as deep in sin
[16:57] as the Roman cathic cic Church
[17:01] Hallelujah now I I made this a few weeks
[17:03] ago I never shared it so hopefully this
[17:05] is helpful hopefully you can see some
[17:06] similarities here now the four horse
[17:09] riders are the white red black and pale
[17:11] of the first four seals and the church
[17:13] said amen amen the meaning is that the
[17:15] white one is deception it's the de and
[17:17] nicadan but it's defeated by the lion
[17:19] anointing the red is a spiritual kill
[17:22] but is actually a natural kill in the
[17:24] church ages it's the actual false
[17:26] Doctrine so the Deeds the Deeds change
[17:28] in doctrines defeated by the ox
[17:30] anointing but the black the black uh
[17:34] writer captures the wealth with the
[17:35] false Unity that's the doctrine of balum
[17:38] and that's defeated by the man
[17:41] anointed okay the last one is the pale
[17:43] horse rider that's total spiritual death
[17:46] it's Jezebel religion and that's
[17:47] defeated by the Flying Eagle anointing
[17:49] praise God okay that that that that's
[17:52] how that's how it's played out this was
[17:54] foreshadowed though in the Old
[17:56] Testament brother tells that because
[17:58] there was four forms of the same bug
[18:01] this is the same writer in four forms
[18:04] right it's the same bug in four
[18:06] different forms yes right right it's the
[18:08] same form for the same writer what's his
[18:10] name death but what's Jesus name life
[18:13] hallelujah what do you got and brother
[18:16] let me get back to this in in that in
[18:18] that reward of the Overcomer in the
[18:19] first church age brother Rand said if
[18:21] you overcome I'm giving you the tree of
[18:23] life and brother said the reason the
[18:25] reward is life is because the Antichrist
[18:27] Spirit came in by death the deeds and
[18:31] doctrines and all that was eventually
[18:32] death so so Jesus so the church CH if
[18:35] you stay away from the Deeds if you stay
[18:37] away from the Antichrist Spirit you get
[18:39] the tree of life Hallelujah if you stay
[18:42] away from Death I'll give you life
[18:44] that's what we got today eternal life
[18:46] hallelujah amen glor
[18:49] beautiful oh I love those rewards of the
[18:51] of the church ages it ties in perfectly
[18:53] with the church
[18:55] ages so remember the white hor rider was
[18:59] prefigured by the canker well thank you
[19:01] sister God bless you got a reward in the
[19:03] name of
[19:05] Jesus did you give it to me in the name
[19:07] of Jesus you got a reward you could have
[19:10] given any name of any disciple sister
[19:13] you could have said brother amen sister
[19:15] who thank you sister I actually need
[19:17] that tonight it's one of the few times I
[19:18] need
[19:19] water brother Rand said so see Satan now
[19:22] this is important for us Satan's going
[19:24] to try to come in as a white horse or as
[19:26] a Kang room to try to eat away our
[19:29] joy right it's the fruit he's going to
[19:32] try to take away the fruit the love the
[19:33] joy the peace longsuffering gentleness
[19:37] goodness Temperance Satan's if you're a
[19:40] holy ghost filled Saint wherever you are
[19:42] he's going to try to eat away on your
[19:43] fruits just like he's going to try to
[19:45] inject a a a deed a tradition in our
[19:48] church but we got to cast it down yes I
[19:51] say like we got to keep cast it down
[19:52] because we have cast him down amen
[19:55] hallelujah second though he tries to be
[19:58] a caterpillar he he grows up to the
[20:00] caterpillar he eats all the fellowship
[20:02] and the leaves so we got to make sure we
[20:04] stay in Fellowship now my best day to
[20:06] Fellowship is Saturday or Sunday so if
[20:09] you want more fellowship with me let's
[20:10] do those days so I got to work five days
[20:13] a week you know so that if you want
[20:15] fellowship with me that's going to how
[20:17] it's going to have to work by God's
[20:18] grace just and then you got your
[20:19] schedule too so we got to make it work
[20:22] that's why I say stay all day Sunday
[20:23] let's eat together let's do whatever we
[20:25] can let's Fellowship amen let's have
[20:27] that time together we just got to find
[20:29] ways to Fellowship amen but be
[20:30] encouraged too we have more services
[20:32] than almost every other church that I
[20:33] know of me Church most M churches are
[20:36] just down in two Services a week a week
[20:39] well we got three every week praise God
[20:42] hallelujah so be encouraged We Gather a
[20:43] lot a lot more than others by God's
[20:45] grace not to make us more holy or
[20:47] anything like that as far as it doesn't
[20:48] make us more holy we want to be more
[20:50] holy but we're trying to obey
[20:52] Jesus and gather more as we see that day
[20:54] approaching yes
[20:56] amen now the Third thir thing the
[20:58] Antichrist Spirit does he eats the
[21:00] doctrine of the bar now that's I don't
[21:01] understand how that's Doctrine but then
[21:03] you know they they get doctrines there
[21:05] so there's a little bit of a lap over I
[21:07] can't explain everything this is what
[21:09] brother taught in the restoration of the
[21:11] brid tree if you listen to that okay but
[21:13] he said then the locus is the mature
[21:15] form of that bug and that eats up the
[21:18] Salvation it eats the life of the the
[21:20] plant right the pul the life okay so
[21:23] does that help a little bit by God's
[21:24] grace remember cam had a good visual up
[21:26] there I took a picture that with my like
[21:28] I want to keep
[21:29] that amen I didn't actually apply that
[21:32] you know cams I forgot to actually look
[21:33] at cams first but uh you you get the
[21:36] idea of it praise God sure I'm sure you
[21:38] get the idea so for us Satan's going to
[21:40] try to get it he's going to try to fight
[21:42] Us by having me or some preacher or what
[21:45] somebody try to inject uh a tradition
[21:47] that's not based upon the word of God
[21:49] but we've got to overcome that by God's
[21:51] grace
[21:52] am now brother mainly teaches this on
[21:55] about six pages in the church age book
[21:57] from 9 1 to 96 and I'm just going to I'm
[22:00] going to summarize this brother R said
[22:02] holy ghost leadership gets replaced by
[22:05] man's leadership with the Deeds of
[22:07] nickolus uh what happens is the
[22:10] priesthood now becomes more holy and
[22:13] stands above the Ley so let me remind
[22:15] you I'm no more holy than you
[22:18] are if you see anything good in me well
[22:20] it's just because I'm trying to yield to
[22:22] God and I constantly have to do a be a
[22:24] public servant for Christ which means I
[22:26] got to constantly repent hum myself but
[22:29] I hope you're doing the same praise God
[22:31] Amen I believe you are but if I look
[22:33] holy it's all because of God's grace in
[22:35] my life I'm trying to repent of my sins
[22:37] I'm trying to serve God I don't want to
[22:38] be a
[22:39] hypocrite right I understand I got to be
[22:41] judged more harsh than other people here
[22:43] so I want to live my life close to
[22:45] Christ as I can hallelujah
[22:47] amen but I'm not above you now I have I
[22:50] have more
[22:51] responsibility as far as you know with a
[22:53] church but each one of us have to answer
[22:55] to God the Bible say every every one of
[22:58] you man or woman child whatever you will
[23:00] answer you'll stand before the Judgment
[23:02] seat of Christ am to receive of the good
[23:05] things that you've done for Christ
[23:07] hallelujah amen but Antichrist starts
[23:10] putting the preachers up above too high
[23:14] yes we're only above by responsibility
[23:17] but remember really brother man said the
[23:18] the the minister is supposed to be the
[23:19] servant the lowest of
[23:21] all that's why I try to I'm not saying
[23:24] this as a joke that's why I try to scrub
[23:26] those
[23:26] toilets I'm not trying to say that as a
[23:29] joke that's why I do because I got to
[23:30] remember I'm the servant of all I should
[23:33] be the servant of all if not I'm in the
[23:35] wrong
[23:35] place the person leading the church
[23:37] should be the humble most humble servant
[23:40] of all and if not it's time for me to
[23:42] repent at the altar right Jesus said
[23:45] make them your your servant your
[23:48] minister brother manam said the J and
[23:50] nians will TI them right back to the old
[23:53] aonic priesthood so it takes them back
[23:55] to
[23:56] legalism which reminds me of some
[23:58] certain Minister's marriage
[24:01] requirements right and I have a video on
[24:03] this and I've got rejected by this I got
[24:04] a lot
[24:05] of slack for this but I know brother
[24:08] Randon mentioned in the marriage and
[24:10] divorce sermon that ministers should
[24:12] marry virgins but to me that was just
[24:15] brother Ram's opinion because it's not
[24:16] in the New Testament brother Ram told us
[24:19] if you can't take it Genesis of
[24:20] Revelation it's not a Bible doctr right
[24:23] right so we're just doing what brother
[24:24] said now some preachers of the message
[24:26] make that such a uh a major doctrine
[24:29] that they hurt people with it especially
[24:32] sisters right especially sisters and
[24:35] like I said there's double standards if
[24:36] you remember when I preached on that I
[24:37] mean it's people people sent me comments
[24:39] like how could people not see what you
[24:41] preach brother Jesse this is this is so
[24:43] clear from the
[24:44] scripture but to me that's just one
[24:46] manifestation actually I didn't put that
[24:48] on the list that could be on the list of
[24:49] one of the Deeds of nickeles if people
[24:51] make this in unbending way
[24:55] right and brother Adam uses he Hebrews
[24:59] 13:7 uh that we need Holy Ghost L
[25:02] leadership we need the same leadership
[25:04] that was in the book of Acts where the
[25:06] preachers and everybody's led by the
[25:08] holy spirit amen hallelujah that's why I
[25:10] try to be I try to be led by the Holy
[25:12] Spirit I try to pray God send me the
[25:13] people at the right time help Lord send
[25:16] me messages to preach I always put on my
[25:17] reminders pray for inspiration to preach
[25:20] to the people I don't want to preach
[25:22] from my thoughts I want to preach from
[25:23] God's thoughts hallelujah amen amen amen
[25:26] another summary from this section of the
[25:28] book brother he starts listing examples
[25:30] of the Deeds of nians that became false
[25:32] doctrines the first one is Apostolic
[25:35] succession this mainly applies to the
[25:37] Roman Catholic Church in other words
[25:38] they believe all their popes go all the
[25:40] way down to Peter that's a lie right you
[25:44] see that that's why the pope can walk
[25:45] around and say I've got appos Sol
[25:47] sucession you know of course he doesn't
[25:49] walk like this I'm just kind of
[25:50] dramatizing He Walks Like This holding
[25:53] his staff and he says I'm a descendant
[25:55] of Peter no you're not Peter never took
[25:58] gold like that he said Silver and Gold
[25:59] Have I
[26:00] None Peter had a wife Hallelujah you're
[26:03] not you're not a successor of Peter
[26:06] furthest from the
[26:09] thing um but that's what that's what it
[26:11] came into and then church membership as
[26:13] long as you're a church member you're
[26:15] saved nonsense you're saved when you
[26:17] have faith in the blood of Jesus
[26:19] Christ yes we should get a church but
[26:21] the church can't save you the church can
[26:23] point you to the one that does save you
[26:25] that's Jesus amen
[26:28] now this is mostly seen in the Roman
[26:29] Catholic church but there's a few
[26:31] message churches though
[26:32] that I feel like they have a version of
[26:35] apostolic succession since they're
[26:37] Pastor new brother Brandon they're more
[26:38] closer to God than we are I don't
[26:40] believe that your life proves your life
[26:44] proves how close you are to Christ right
[26:47] I I want to be close to brother BR but
[26:48] really brother Bram was trying to be
[26:49] close to Christ Hallelujah and that's
[26:52] who whether I knew brother Ram or not I
[26:54] mean eventually we're get this spot of
[26:55] time goes on no one knew brother ROM and
[26:57] then what are we lost no to know brother
[27:00] random is not life to know Christ is
[27:03] life so I guess we're blasting
[27:05] Antichrist Spirit tonight the third one
[27:08] is brother R said they the Roman
[27:09] Catholic Church made acts 2:4 brother R
[27:12] said can you imagine if acts 2:4 said
[27:15] and on the day of Pentecost they were
[27:16] all filled with the Holy Ghost when the
[27:18] priest put a wafer on their
[27:20] tongues have you seen a Catholic service
[27:22] before they go up there I go up there
[27:25] and the the the priest puts a wafer on
[27:27] their tongue
[27:28] I've got the Holy Ghost out that's what
[27:29] they believe they believe as long as I
[27:31] got that wine as long as that's in my
[27:33] body I'm Anointed with the Holy Ghost
[27:35] what a bunch of nonsense as long as I'm
[27:37] singing his Praises I've got the Holy
[27:39] Ghost as long as I confess my sin I'm
[27:41] filled with the Holy Ghost AM Hallelujah
[27:44] that's what the Bible says be filled
[27:46] with the spirit don't be drunk online
[27:48] but be filled with the spirit talk to
[27:50] yourselves in pongs and hyms and
[27:52] spiritual Psalms
[27:54] amen
[27:56] glory thank you Jesus thank you Jesus
[28:00] now to me the message version is that is
[28:03] just believe brother brandom and you're
[28:04] born again that's the same thing same
[28:06] thing is saying put this wafer and you
[28:07] got the Holy Ghost the same thing is you
[28:09] you believe in brother BR you're filled
[28:11] with the Holy Ghost that's a
[28:13] lie fourth brother R said they made
[28:15] water baptism pouring instead of
[28:19] immersion now today it's baptize the
[28:21] name of William Brandon which is heresy
[28:24] which is blasphemy yes that's blasphemy
[28:27] to baptized in the name of William
[28:28] Brandon we only baptized in the name of
[28:30] Jesus Christ yes amen
[28:34] hallelujah I got a man that said uh I
[28:36] made a video on that he said no William
[28:38] brandham is my God I said what question
[28:40] mark question mark I said repent of your
[28:41] blasphemy amen you are deceived by
[28:44] brother Brandon himself said I'm Not
[28:46] Jesus Christ right I'm not even I'm a
[28:48] sinner saved by grace he said I'm not
[28:50] fit to live he said i't say that be
[28:52] humble I said repent
[28:55] sir and then brother uses this verse
[28:58] Paul warned them for three years
[28:59] remember wolves are going to come in not
[29:01] sparing the fly so how are they going to
[29:03] get in they were going to get in and
[29:04] deceive people they said draw people
[29:07] after their own selves pull them out of
[29:09] the true church with their deeds and
[29:10] nicadan with their Antichrist
[29:13] teachings I'm going to get to the list
[29:14] here in just a moment thank you for your
[29:18] patience the fifth one the priests are
[29:21] holier than the le le Nici means conquer
[29:25] the L Paul said all Lees should have the
[29:27] leading of the Holy Ghost some message
[29:29] people don't have a Ministry like the
[29:31] pastor in other words everybody I I look
[29:33] at my life like I got to constantly
[29:34] Minister you should have that same view
[29:38] and that's why I want everybody to grow
[29:39] into that now amen's got it built in
[29:41] he's are him and I we already got it
[29:43] built in Casa Mali Lydia they already
[29:45] got it build in but they can have more I
[29:48] can have
[29:49] more we all can have more Ministries but
[29:52] youve got to look at it just like I look
[29:54] at it I I've got to preach I got to pray
[29:56] I got to feed the people people of God
[29:58] you got to look at the same way you have
[29:59] an important part for every service
[30:01] praise God
[30:02] Amen that's what brother R says brother
[30:05] R said it's essential that you do it now
[30:06] how many believe brother
[30:08] brand it's essential that you look at
[30:11] your ministry like it's just as
[30:12] important as brother Jesse's
[30:14] Ministry amen
[30:17] hallelujah see as we mature we're going
[30:19] to get to that everybody's going to see
[30:21] that more and more we'll get to that by
[30:23] the grace of
[30:25] God and I love this verse brother R say
[30:27] how is it brotherr how is it when you
[30:28] come to church when you come together
[30:30] every one of you got a song Everybody's
[30:32] Got a song to
[30:33] sing everybody's got a Doctrine
[30:36] Hallelujah Glory everyone's got a tongue
[30:39] everyone has a revelation at least we
[30:40] should have that one praise God everyone
[30:43] hath an interpretation let all things be
[30:45] done to edify in other words you should
[30:47] come to church saying I Lord this
[30:50] blessed me maybe I can share with
[30:52] somebody at
[30:53] church right right like a quote like a
[30:56] song
[30:58] like a scripture
[31:00] right think think of something you know
[31:02] that will bless other people like one
[31:05] example when Zur you know she texted me
[31:07] that video about the Barbie well that
[31:09] out of that came a sermon and that
[31:11] blessed a lot of people remember that I
[31:13] preached on the Lord Lord God of Lords
[31:15] I'm Lord yeah Lord God of gods that was
[31:17] a good that was a good thing she had a
[31:19] little she had a revelation she had a a
[31:23] teaching she wanted to share that was
[31:24] good I like that Hallelujah
[31:28] so see we got to be led by the Holy
[31:30] Spirit you know God doesn't just want us
[31:31] to hear here here God wants us to share
[31:35] amen right that's just the recent one I
[31:38] thought of so thank you sister thanks
[31:39] for that water too by get drink now
[31:42] here's that quote brother
[31:44] rson he's talking about brother Neville
[31:46] Pastor uh Collins and Hickerson were
[31:49] brothers that could do tongues
[31:51] interpretation he said now their tongues
[31:53] interpretation that's not brother
[31:55] Neville's Ministry that's your Ministry
[31:57] to the brothers Neville I'm sorry
[31:59] Hickerson and
[32:00] Collins I'm giving this as an example
[32:03] then you Brethren should be just as
[32:04] interested in getting your ministry in
[32:06] the place of the house of God as the
[32:07] pastor is interested in getting in his
[32:10] because it's just essential that you do
[32:12] it there is no better feeling for me
[32:15] than to hear people say oh I just needed
[32:17] to hear that sermon brother
[32:19] Jesse I like when they say it when guest
[32:21] preachers come but I like when you say
[32:23] it when I preached
[32:24] you so that I haven't missed a too much
[32:28] that I prayed I I've sought God I
[32:30] studied I've done my part or the Holy
[32:32] Ghost Falls while we're worshiping and
[32:35] God uses my gift I love that praise God
[32:38] Amen but it's essential it's essential
[32:41] and I believe as the Rapture is nearing
[32:43] each and every person is going to
[32:44] realize the importance of your gift yes
[32:47] Hallelujah and so you either pray at
[32:49] home for the gift or or you'll pray here
[32:51] when you get to the gift or pray after
[32:53] you know the thing is pray the thing is
[32:55] realize you got a Ministry nobody can do
[32:57] what you can do only you can do it
[32:59] praise God H and we need that praise God
[33:02] I need your gift you need my gift we
[33:03] need one another praise God amen amen
[33:07] amen and you know Church honestly these
[33:09] last few months when people come up for
[33:11] prayer I just asked the Lord over here
[33:12] Lord who should I call up should I call
[33:14] up anybody to pray because I'm looking
[33:15] out there and I'm think well Lord who's
[33:17] got faith maybe that faith that would
[33:18] help my
[33:20] faith like who was sick on Jose I almost
[33:23] called up some people to pray for him
[33:25] but some people were busy you know I
[33:26] like well I'm starting to do that I'm
[33:28] trying to think who who can I look out
[33:30] during the service and I feel like
[33:31] they've got faith anointed that they'll
[33:33] pray the prayer Faith hallelujah
[33:36] amen I want to feel led to do that
[33:38] praise God I want you to use your gifts
[33:41] as
[33:42] well right each person has a gift each
[33:44] person has a Ministry remember Satan's
[33:46] job is to say oh only the preacher can
[33:48] do this only the now only the preacher
[33:50] can preach but other than that you can
[33:52] do everything else
[33:53] hallelujah amen Satan's job is to
[33:56] conquer the lady make the preacher he's
[33:58] the only holy one and you know me I'm
[34:00] I'm not holy the only holy thing in me
[34:02] is the Holy
[34:03] Ghost there only a part of me that's
[34:05] holy just like you amen I'm no better
[34:08] than
[34:09] anybody I've got my gifts I got to be
[34:11] faithful to my gifts you've got be
[34:13] faithful to your gifts amen six brother
[34:16] in the same six pages brother BR the
[34:18] sixth thing is the Vicor of Christ which
[34:19] is the
[34:20] pope seventh is Purgatory eighth is mass
[34:24] now a lot of these things don't pertain
[34:25] to us as messy believers the ninth is
[34:27] the Roman Catholic Church started paying
[34:29] money to get out of
[34:30] hell these are these are the examples
[34:32] brother bam gives of the Deeds that
[34:34] turned into doctrines of the
[34:39] nians now he also taught on this on the
[34:42] last uh chapter re uh chapter 10 is
[34:45] called the resume of the church ages and
[34:47] he kind of reviews and hits the
[34:48] highlights of the entire
[34:50] book um and then he gives a little more
[34:53] detail 10th now this is interesting
[34:56] brother Ram said when they got the Deeds
[34:57] of nicadan the clergy set themselves in
[35:00] ranks over one another so these
[35:02] preachers said well we're a little bit
[35:03] better than these preachers and these
[35:05] preachers are a little bit better than
[35:06] other
[35:08] preachers that reminds me of some goat
[35:10] debates they had last
[35:12] year that's what they're saying they're
[35:14] saying they're greater than other
[35:16] people so see to me that's what it is
[35:19] the goat debate is a manifestation
[35:21] listen of the Deeds of nicolus that's my
[35:24] thought it's not a Doctrine yet as I
[35:27] emailed the brothers I said give me the
[35:28] scriptures they didn't have any
[35:29] scriptures the only scripture was uh the
[35:32] only scripture was John the Baptist with
[35:34] Grace in the Old Testament so they're
[35:35] presuming brother brandom is the
[35:36] greatest and then if we preach brother
[35:38] Brams then we're the greatest preachers
[35:39] ever we preach his
[35:42] ministry but was they do they actually
[35:44] have literal scripture that says that
[35:49] no to see how Sly that Antichrist spirit
[35:52] is and but I have the scripture anybody
[35:55] who argues how great they are does not
[35:58] have the Holy
[35:59] Ghost I got scripture for that
[36:03] Hallelujah Jesus's own disciples before
[36:05] they the Holy Ghost I'm greater no I'm
[36:07] greater no you're greater I'm
[36:11] greater 11 these are quotes from Brother
[36:14] R within the true church men whom God
[36:17] had called as overseers were holding
[36:19] that title to mean a little more than
[36:20] just local responsibility so this is
[36:23] rare in my opinion but it only happens
[36:25] when p p P try to Pastor more than one
[36:28] Church see I was having my typos last
[36:30] night sorry not more than on church but
[36:32] one church or they travel too much while
[36:36] still taking
[36:37] tithes right let's say you're gone three
[36:39] months how can you take a tithe when
[36:41] you're gone three months you didn't feed
[36:42] those sheep for three months how can you
[36:46] naturally they a Shepherd if he's gone
[36:47] three months he can't drink the milk of
[36:49] his sheep right or whatever goats
[36:51] whatever he can't enjoy the tithing
[36:53] right he ain't there so see it's just
[36:56] off the work but they're rare
[36:58] cases right but this is what
[37:00] happens now where we would see it is
[37:02] where a pastor tries to have more than
[37:04] one congregation where he could P like
[37:06] that's what that's what the
[37:07] denominations do I'm just going to say
[37:09] the name Grace Church that's what they
[37:11] do they'll have one group and then
[37:13] they'll have all their satellite
[37:14] churches out there well that's not
[37:15] scriptural every church should have a
[37:17] sovereign Church Sovereign Pastor Right
[37:21] One Pastor shouldn't LED over six or
[37:23] seven other congregations of pastors
[37:26] right that's denominational that's too
[37:28] much Authority that gives that man too
[37:30] much power
[37:32] right
[37:35] Hallelujah but remember church now look
[37:38] Solomon said it's the little foxes that
[37:40] spoil the the the bride tree can I say
[37:43] like
[37:44] that and then Jesus said the Pharisees
[37:46] Sadducees they they paid tithes on the
[37:49] mint of the Anis and the cumin but they
[37:52] omitted the weigher matters of the law
[37:54] judgment mercy and Faith these ought you
[37:56] have done but not leave the other undone
[37:59] so see churches can let either little
[38:01] sins ruin their congregations or big
[38:04] sins right so either one we've got to be
[38:08] diligent with big things we got to be
[38:09] diligent with little things too and not
[38:12] to become micromanagers I'm not trying
[38:14] to micromanage your life not to become
[38:16] CR criticized and everything we got to
[38:19] have Liberty amen but I believe the Holy
[38:22] Ghost will show us if we're off the word
[38:23] in anything especially if I'm up here
[38:25] asking God to show me my faults and my
[38:28] wrongs I'm begging God God I've done
[38:30] wrong please show me right same same
[38:33] thing for you if you're asking God to
[38:34] cleanse my heart and keep me pure don't
[38:37] you think God's going to do it amen
[38:40] don't you think God's going to wash you
[38:41] in the waters of the word certainly
[38:43] certainly it's already 7:30 wow now I
[38:46] want to read this quote here this just
[38:48] encouraged me woman is a little thing
[38:50] it's a small thing in the
[38:51] Bible right it's a modesty thing right
[38:55] it's a it's a h ship thing it's an honor
[38:58] thing right women must honor their
[39:01] husbands or honor their their fathers
[39:03] right until they're married well says if
[39:06] you catch it in these little minor
[39:07] doctrines you'll catch the major
[39:09] doctrines amen hallelujah if you're
[39:13] faithful in the little things he'll make
[39:14] you ruler over many things amen amen
[39:17] that's right he said like Gideon
[39:20] separating these men there's thousands
[39:22] and thousands but God said that's too
[39:23] many separate them again he gave them
[39:25] another test and separated them again
[39:28] again and on down so he had a little
[39:30] handful he said that's the group I want
[39:32] you to do the job that's exactly what
[39:34] happened Pentecostal women going back
[39:36] and forth sitting there hearing it
[39:37] knowing by the word that's wrong you
[39:39] think they'll cope with it no sir every
[39:41] year when I pass by there's more Bob
[39:43] haired than there was when I started
[39:46] said what's that got to do you ought to
[39:48] someone said why brother R people regard
[39:50] you as a prophet now I don't say I was a
[39:51] prophet nobody hears me say that but yet
[39:53] he did say under the anointing so see he
[39:56] something he doesn't remember sometimes
[39:58] what he said under the anointing because
[39:59] some the Holy Ghost takes over for him
[40:01] the son of man anointing takes
[40:03] over Hallelujah that's right he says why
[40:08] don't you teach people to receive the
[40:09] Holy Ghost and how to get this and great
[40:11] good great spiritual gifts and help the
[40:13] church how can I teach them algebra when
[40:14] they won't even learn their ABCs that's
[40:17] right you do the little things get down
[40:18] here at the bottom and brush it off and
[40:20] start off right amen
[40:24] hallelujah like a simple illustration
[40:26] brother Irvin last when I was there two
[40:28] weeks ago he showed me the pictures of
[40:30] the house when they moved in that house
[40:32] that house was an absolute dumpster
[40:36] fire it was covered in Vines and trees
[40:39] inside trash was everywhere that's the
[40:41] grossest looking thing I've ever seen
[40:44] they said they found uh brother irban
[40:46] found four S foot long snakes living in
[40:50] there just inside the house it took them
[40:52] four months to clean that house now why
[40:55] am I saying that
[40:57] because they left the Amish communities
[41:00] and said we feel led to come down here
[41:02] now you go in their house today it's SP
[41:03] and span you wouldn't see even an old
[41:06] snake
[41:07] skin you wouldn't even see the dust off
[41:10] a snake's belly so
[41:12] clean what happened they got down I love
[41:16] I love it God Did It God's doing in the
[41:18] spiritual what he's already done in the
[41:19] natural there
[41:21] Hallelujah they had to brush it down for
[41:23] four months and clean up and get all the
[41:25] me you and the mold and the trash out
[41:27] they to burn all this up get down to the
[41:29] very bottom that's what we do as
[41:30] Christians get down to the very Basics
[41:32] just start right just learn how to
[41:34] repent just learn how to be saved and
[41:36] then build on that praise God get these
[41:39] little things right get the first thing
[41:40] right get the foundation right then you
[41:42] can build on that praise
[41:44] God clean out the Bottom clean it all
[41:47] all the way down to the bottom amen
[41:49] build your foundation on a rock of God's
[41:51] word amen amen
[41:54] hallelujah don't take any person's guess
[41:57] for it you take the word of God for it
[42:00] amen hallelujah always believe Christ
[42:02] that's the ABCs that I
[42:04] know always believe
[42:06] Christ now remember this
[42:09] verse there's six
[42:11] foundational uh teachings that most
[42:13] churches fail on just the second one so
[42:17] here's a
[42:18] list I'm sorry they fail on the first
[42:21] one most churches fail on the first of
[42:25] the elementary doctrines they never
[42:27] repent of their fornication their
[42:30] adultery right their addictions uh their
[42:33] cursing their blasphemy they never even
[42:36] repent of
[42:37] that how are they going to go anywhere
[42:39] with God if you never go to the first
[42:42] step oh but church if we can if we can
[42:45] look at our lives and honestly say God
[42:48] has already built those into our lives
[42:50] then we know we're maturing as we've
[42:52] been preaching on maturity amen we know
[42:54] we're moving on to perfection the
[42:56] fivefold ministry is perfecting us
[42:58] hallelujah
[43:00] amen remember that so this is basically
[43:02] justification sanctification repenting
[43:04] from all dead works this is Faith
[43:06] towards God not towards denomination not
[43:08] towards your mom your dad your grandma
[43:10] the pastor it's Faith towards God
[43:12] hallelujah amen amen doctrine of
[43:15] baptisms that's the water baptism that's
[43:18] the Holy Ghost baptism I got a new one
[43:20] this week it's also the baptism of
[43:21] suffering Jesus said Jesus said I have a
[43:24] baptized a bapt say I'm going to be
[43:26] baptized with and he said I'm
[43:28] straightened until it's accomplished
[43:30] that means
[43:31] distressed so see there's there's
[43:33] something that we can learn there I
[43:34] learned that this week that's right
[43:36] there is a baptism of suffering in other
[43:38] words some people's lives are swallowed
[43:39] up in suffering and you look at their
[43:41] lives and say why do they suffer that
[43:43] why did Paul get whipped five times you
[43:45] know 39 stres why he had to go through
[43:47] the suffering he had to go through the
[43:49] baptism of
[43:51] fire some people have to go through that
[43:54] some people lose loved ones unexpectedly
[43:56] some people lose things and you wonder
[43:57] why they got to suffer so hard it's a
[43:59] baptism they got to go through God
[44:01] ordained their life for
[44:04] that right God ordered all the steps of
[44:07] the
[44:08] righteous then laying on of hands right
[44:11] you don't lay somebody uh you don't
[44:13] anoint somebody real soon right after
[44:15] they got saved they need time to prove
[44:17] themselves but also you lay hands on the
[44:20] sick and they shall
[44:21] recover the resurrection of the Dead Z
[44:23] and I were texted about this and there's
[44:24] two resurrections
[44:26] right the resurrection is the rapture
[44:27] that's called the first resurrection the
[44:29] second Resurrection is the white Throne
[44:30] judgment yes but most people don't know
[44:32] there's two
[44:33] resurrections everybody thinks well
[44:35] we're all going to live through the
[44:36] Millennium no we're not many people are
[44:37] going to miss out of the
[44:38] Millennium right they'll they'll still
[44:40] have eternal life they'll still be saved
[44:42] under the altar they're going to miss
[44:43] out on on that great time think about
[44:46] that judging judging Nations for a
[44:49] thousand
[44:50] years my goodness that's that's going to
[44:53] be quite a thing we don't want to miss
[44:54] that church we don't want to miss that
[44:55] right judging Nations building houses
[44:58] inhabiting them for a thousand years
[45:01] amen judging cities ruling a city for a
[45:03] thousand years you how many times we
[45:05] drive down to barbon We complain about
[45:07] the potholes in barbon I tell you when
[45:10] we get some cities we're going to do it
[45:12] right not just once every 10 years we'll
[45:16] do it right that's just a small example
[45:18] right but the Bible said in those days
[45:21] when you if you're a judge of that City
[45:22] or if you're the ruler of that City the
[45:24] Bible said there will be a sound and you
[45:26] command everybody to go to the house of
[45:27] the Lord for worship Hallelujah and All
[45:30] Nations shall flow into that worship
[45:32] hallelujah amen you say City it's time
[45:37] time to go up and worship Our
[45:39] Savior follow me I've got a ride of ir
[45:41] too his the bigger one of course he's
[45:44] the great man of God he's the great God
[45:46] in flesh hallelujah we're just his
[45:49] servants but he's rewarding us for
[45:51] sacrifices made here if you suffer with
[45:54] him here you'll reign with him there
[45:56] praise God
[45:58] Amen but don't forget this remember to
[46:01] get to that you got to be mature
[46:04] remember read we preached on this a few
[46:05] weeks ago might have been last week no
[46:07] two weeks ago two Wednesdays ago be
[46:09] therefore perfect be mature as your
[46:11] heavenly fathers
[46:13] mature so judging everything in your
[46:15] life now not
[46:21] illegalism I doing good or am I doing
[46:23] evil each day is this evil for my life
[46:25] or is this good for my life right that's
[46:29] maturity now I wrote about the deeds in
[46:32] my uh book there four pages 428
[46:35] 429 now I I I found more examples as I
[46:38] studied the same history books brother
[46:39] brandom did holidays that's him that's
[46:42] kind of a a stinger for some people you
[46:45] know Christmas really is a stinger for a
[46:47] lot of
[46:48] people but holidays can be Deeds of
[46:51] nickolus okay if it's taken into excess
[46:54] like like like right with Santa Claus or
[46:57] people buying gifts they can't even
[46:59] afford don't put yourself in debt to
[47:01] give out a gift right right don't do
[47:04] that don't don't be pressured into that
[47:07] don't put yourself in a bad position you
[47:08] know because that brother said that's
[47:09] the spirit of commercialism that's not
[47:11] the spirit of Christ right you're caught
[47:14] up well this person gave me this I got
[47:15] to give it back just give him a hug back
[47:16] if you can't afford it just draw a
[47:18] little picture WR a thank you no I love
[47:20] you and I'll be praying for you they'd
[47:23] rather have your prayers than you know
[47:24] you getting in debt right idolatry they
[47:27] actually built actual Idols in these
[47:30] temples when poar went back to Rome in
[47:32] 155 ad the
[47:34] Eucharist water baptism that's a repeat
[47:37] and clergy of BU lady that's a repeat
[47:39] now when polycarp he was a student of St
[47:41] John when he went back to Rome to see
[47:43] what it's like he actually went there
[47:45] knowing they were entrenched in idolatry
[47:47] but when he went back what did he
[47:49] witness he watched them all like candles
[47:51] they go up to a statue of Peter and they
[47:53] bow down to Peter that's in role and
[47:56] brother said this is a doctrine of the
[47:59] nicadan now I believe that it probably
[48:01] already advanced at that point to
[48:02] Jezebel religion because Jud Jezebel
[48:05] religion is not ashamed of Idols Jezebel
[48:07] wasn't ashamed to have a church of Idols
[48:10] neither is the Roman Catholic
[48:13] Church all
[48:16] right okay so another one I saw was
[48:20] transubstantiation we're turning that
[48:22] the the the wafer and the the wine we're
[48:24] turning that into body and blood of
[48:26] Jesus that's a lie that church has had
[48:29] some issues with some other things too
[48:30] especially with vows and marriage they
[48:32] they let their children break vows
[48:33] they're already engaged but they break
[48:35] the vow let them marry this one and that
[48:36] one that doesn't sound like the Bible to
[48:38] me but see even you would think well how
[48:41] could that be in a mess of church well
[48:43] how could it how could it not Satan's F
[48:45] fighting them that hard right and they
[48:47] if they give into Satan if they love
[48:49] those Spirits R said then they they
[48:52] can't get delivered from those Spirits
[48:53] because they love that they love
[48:54] politics I'll say like this they love
[48:56] having their own way rather than the
[48:58] Holy Ghost having his way our prayer
[49:01] should be holy ghost have your way
[49:02] tonight amen I'm forgetting my opinions
[49:05] I'm forgetting my thoughts I don't want
[49:07] my way Holy Ghost have your
[49:12] way now this is review from last year so
[49:15] I don't know if sisters or if you were
[49:16] here when I preach this but I want to
[49:17] show it to you um would have been good
[49:19] for Lena to be I don't know yeah she was
[49:21] here yeah yeah she was here that's
[49:23] right so these are examples I gave last
[49:26] year eight ex doctrines of devils I
[49:28] believe some of them are clear in the
[49:30] scripture some of them are uh message
[49:33] Traditions from churches that have
[49:35] fallen to the Antichrist spirit so these
[49:38] are Deeds that became doctrines now the
[49:40] first one remember the Bible said there
[49:42] seducing Spirits doctrines of devils
[49:45] when people leave the book of Acts all
[49:46] they can get is doctrines of devils yes
[49:49] yes true the first one this is a this is
[49:51] in the Bible Paul called it preachers
[49:54] that said you have to to be single to be
[49:56] a preacher Paul said that's of the
[50:01] devil the second when they say you can't
[50:03] eat meat on Friday yet they'll eat fish
[50:05] on
[50:07] Friday Paul said that's a doctrine of
[50:10] Hell remember he said the kingdom of God
[50:12] is not in meat and drink but it's Joy
[50:15] righteousness and peace in the Holy
[50:17] Ghost amen that's the meat for the Holy
[50:20] Ghost brother it's not in fish or thank
[50:23] you Lord beef or whatever more ham is a
[50:26] pork it's not in that that's not the
[50:28] kingdom of God it's the Holy Ghost
[50:30] attributes hallelujah amen peace joy and
[50:34] righteousness he said that's a doctrine
[50:36] of the
[50:39] devil another one is the raptures
[50:41] already happened that's of the devil
[50:44] Paul said
[50:45] it no fasting that's of the
[50:48] devil
[50:50] right that's what the Bible
[50:52] says look it up it's Philippians 3:19
[50:55] their God becomes their belly think
[50:57] about that they worship they worship
[50:59] their belly and say okay I hear your
[51:01] ground now I'm running over to
[51:03] McDonald's for the fourth time
[51:05] today or fourth time this week they
[51:08] worship their own belly I got to feed
[51:11] you more I got to feed you more or
[51:13] Chipotle for the fourth time today it
[51:15] don't matter the it's not the the
[51:17] restaurant is not I mean it could be the
[51:19] problem restaurant restaurant is not
[51:20] always a problem the restaurant is a the
[51:22] lust of the flesh that's the problem
[51:24] amen worshiping their own bellies and
[51:27] doing it for money right trying to get
[51:29] the money from the preachers the
[51:31] preachers trying to get the money and
[51:32] they serve their own belly that's a
[51:35] doctrine of a
[51:36] devil turning Grace into lawlessness or
[51:40] once saved always saved everyone will go
[51:41] to heaven right that's from
[51:45] Hell God always wants you Healthy and
[51:47] Wealthy that's from hell and the church
[51:50] said amen preach on that one hard enough
[51:54] make presuming and just presuming and
[51:56] preaching it like his Doctrine and
[51:57] exalting brother brandom and his
[51:59] followers as the greatest of all time
[52:00] and they never say except for Jesus they
[52:02] never say that that's a doctrine of a
[52:05] devil in my
[52:06] opinion nobody God does not share his
[52:09] glory with anybody right and the person
[52:13] Jesus called the greatest didn't
[52:14] consider himself the
[52:18] greatest so how can these preachers that
[52:20] consider consider themselves the
[52:21] greatest how can they be the greatest if
[52:23] they consider themselves the greatest it
[52:24] doesn't fit the pattern right they say
[52:27] rapturing faith is literally on the
[52:29] tapes rapturing faith is an anointing
[52:31] from Heaven praise God Amen it's not
[52:34] literally on the tape it's preached
[52:36] about on the tape but it's not on the
[52:37] tape it's not a possession of the tape
[52:39] it's God's possession amen amen see it's
[52:42] a worshiping the tape it's a
[52:45] demon getting your attention off Christ
[52:48] yes worshiping a man worshiping a
[52:51] machine brother said God never ordained
[52:53] for machines to preach the gospel Glory
[52:55] amen hallelujah or Angels or the wind or
[52:59] animals he said men men that were washed
[53:02] in the blood of Jesus filled with the
[53:03] spirit of God Amen that's who God
[53:06] ordained to preach Not Angels right also
[53:09] making a tradition out of brother's like
[53:11] well brother Ram did this one time I can
[53:13] do it and what they do is they just make
[53:14] an excuse to enjoy sin the example I
[53:17] showed you was with movies right brother
[53:19] R supposedly watched a few movies we
[53:20] don't know how much of the movies he
[53:22] watched so some brothers preaching and
[53:24] said well now I have this license I can
[53:25] watch whatever I want that's a lie from
[53:27] hell right that's a doctrine of a devil
[53:31] that's straining at a knat swallowing a
[53:33] camel well brother Adam said he did this
[53:35] and that but then you added your own
[53:36] interpretation you swallowed a camel you
[53:39] took on all this
[53:43] sin now I believe this this is my this
[53:46] is my opinion but I I got a little bit
[53:48] of scripture for it but I'm not going to
[53:49] say it's a
[53:50] doctor Holy Ghost filled Saints can only
[53:53] go so far on this four step
[53:56] attacks from Satan the Deeds the
[53:59] doctrines bism Jezebel I believe a holy
[54:02] ghost filed Christian can only go to
[54:04] that first step that's what I believe I
[54:06] don't believe a holy ghost filed
[54:08] Christian can preach a false Doctrine
[54:10] and make it the unbending way I don't
[54:12] believe
[54:14] that okay that's my own opinion now
[54:16] could they be saved yeah but they' be
[54:19] foolish virgin that's what I believe
[54:21] like think of all these nice think about
[54:22] all these nice Pentecostal people that
[54:23] speak in tongues they tongu the evens
[54:26] yet they'll go over and they'll make
[54:27] they'll make tremendous sacrifices to
[54:29] try to win souls and save Souls they'll
[54:31] do missionary work and some of them are
[54:33] so
[54:34] sincere right and they're not rich
[54:36] they're not making money Baptist even
[54:38] Baptist I've seen Baptists go to Kenya
[54:40] uh they they
[54:42] sacrifice you don't think God going to
[54:44] honor that God's going to honor that
[54:46] right but they got some false doctrines
[54:49] right like no dancing they say no
[54:51] shouting no screaming no speaking in
[54:53] tongues that's what the Baptists say
[54:56] that's a Doctrine that's a false
[54:58] Doctrine that's a doctrine of the
[55:00] nians all right now now you brother just
[55:03] you say how can you say that because
[55:05] they're ignorant of it they don't even
[55:07] realize what they're doing now some of
[55:09] you weren't in Domination some of you
[55:10] were but listen I was in denomination I
[55:13] was baptized follow in the Holy Ghost I
[55:14] didn't even know what I was doing I
[55:16] thought I was right with it
[55:17] amen some of these people they're just
[55:20] ignorant of it they do not understand
[55:22] did you understand the right baptism
[55:24] when you were in the CMA
[55:25] I'm startor pointing at you ones I know
[55:27] her denomination no you don't even you
[55:29] don't even know you're trying your best
[55:31] to serve God some of these people
[55:34] they're they're preaching doctrines of
[55:35] nians and they don't even realize what
[55:37] they're doing right because it ain't the
[55:40] time and season for a
[55:41] gift right now here's my doctrinal proof
[55:45] Peter and Galatians 2 I use this
[55:47] illustration all the time you're
[55:48] probably like falling asleep brother why
[55:50] you going to use a different
[55:50] illustration but it's so critical for us
[55:52] because he's a holy ghost filed man
[55:55] and he separates himself from
[55:57] fellowship so look like the bugs start
[55:59] eating some of those leaves there right
[56:02] interesting Holy Ghost F man he has a
[56:05] deed of
[56:06] anul right that's a that's a false it's
[56:08] a false
[56:09] teaching he taught all the Jews think
[56:11] about he taught all the Jews in the
[56:13] church don't eat with the don't eat with
[56:15] the
[56:17] Smiths he taught every don't eat it with
[56:20] them they're
[56:21] unclean now they might have some
[56:22] sickness in their house that's not what
[56:25] he was talking about he was talking
[56:26] about Gentiles are just dirty people
[56:28] Jews are normally cleaner
[56:30] people see but but he got corrected
[56:33] praise God yes and brother said polycarp
[56:37] was a mighty man of God he the Roman
[56:40] Catholic Church said either we're going
[56:41] to kill you or your town and polycarp at
[56:43] 95 years old gave himself up to be
[56:45] burned at the steak that's a man of God
[56:47] right there he said don't kill these
[56:49] children don't kill the he said take me
[56:51] and then they burned him alive that's a
[56:53] real man of God but brother said he
[56:55] leaned a little bit he wasn't militant
[56:57] against
[56:59] nanism um brother R said he used the
[57:02] word Bishop a little too freely and he
[57:05] let the he let the pastors have too much
[57:08] influence over other churches that they
[57:10] were not pastoring so brother Ram said
[57:13] that's what history says about polycarp
[57:16] but see he can still be a holy ghost
[57:18] filed man of God what is like brother
[57:20] said what is your and my testimony going
[57:22] to be to his right what is it going to
[57:25] right we have an easy life you know
[57:27] nobody hates us we get some few bad
[57:29] comments or people don't want to hang
[57:31] out with us
[57:32] anymore but we're not being burned the
[57:35] steak with the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[57:37] that's why I always want to humble
[57:38] myself what is my testimony just helping
[57:41] to be something God me have some
[57:43] testimony praise God have to beat myself
[57:46] up or I'm not trying to beat you up I'm
[57:48] just saying let's respect these Saints
[57:50] who have gone on before us praise God
[57:52] hallelujah amen not call ourselves the
[57:54] greatest all time we never do I'm just
[57:55] preaching to the audience
[57:57] there these people that some of them
[57:59] hopefully some of them can be convinced
[58:00] to leave the tape Church movement or
[58:01] these preacher movement that exalt the
[58:04] preachers as the greatest of all time
[58:05] they could leave
[58:08] that so I believe based on these
[58:10] examples a holy ghost F Christian can
[58:12] only do the deed step they'll never go
[58:14] into the false Doctrine that's what I
[58:16] believe but I'm not saying I'm right I'm
[58:18] just saying those are the examples I can
[58:21] find
[58:23] okay now I put a video out about this
[58:26] today it was pretty well received I
[58:28] forgot about this I shared this with
[58:29] Simon and cam Simon and cam like to
[58:31] preach on the deeds and the uh uh the
[58:34] doctrines of nicadan which it could be
[58:36] helpful it's helped
[58:39] me but here's a quote brother R was
[58:41] preaching in 1951 out in
[58:43] Arizona and you're going to you're going
[58:45] to listen to me read his quote brother
[58:47] Ram wasn't planning on prophesying but
[58:49] the Holy Ghost comes on him and he
[58:51] prophesies right there about the Rapture
[58:53] Hallelujah and his his scripture is
[58:56] Solomon taking all these stones from
[58:59] around the world and bringing them to
[59:01] one place and they all fit perfectly
[59:03] amen that's his that's his prophecy
[59:06] about the Rapture that's what God's
[59:07] going to do before the
[59:08] Rapture remember where did all those
[59:10] stones got to be cut they weren't cut in
[59:12] Jerusalem they were cut out in their
[59:14] native
[59:16] lands Hallelujah so where are we going
[59:18] to get cut the Rapture no sir we're
[59:20] going to get cut way before the Rapture
[59:23] way before this body comes together God
[59:24] will cut us in a amen he'll cut us in
[59:27] Alan he'll cut us in Sheffield he'll cut
[59:29] us in Iowa he's going to cut us and then
[59:31] bring us together at that great
[59:33] Gathering Place of the building of God
[59:36] the meeting in the air praise
[59:38] God beautiful am when Solomon built the
[59:42] temple they was cut out from all over
[59:44] the world when they come back together
[59:46] there wasn't a buzz or a saw nor the
[59:49] sound of a hammer every block no matter
[59:52] if this one might have been cut like
[59:53] Oneness or Tess or greess or the finess
[59:57] whatever it was when they come together
[59:59] they went dovetail one with the other
[1:00:02] now I believe this could even mean
[1:00:03] denominational people could get saved
[1:00:05] Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:00:06] right before the Rapture hey if God did
[1:00:09] it with Samson God could do it with
[1:00:10] other people too right God does quick
[1:00:12] work sometimes right amen
[1:00:16] right like think about uh the Ephesians
[1:00:19] they were Justified Sanctified they just
[1:00:21] needed to know there was the Holy Ghost
[1:00:22] and as soon as Paul laid hands on them
[1:00:24] the Holy Ghost fell on them praise God
[1:00:26] hallelujah they just need that one extra
[1:00:28] key to unlock that last door amen amen
[1:00:33] hallelujah there wasn't any arguing
[1:00:35] there wasn't any buzzing once the stones
[1:00:37] all came together amen I love this mad
[1:00:40] as people wasn't any arguing wasn't any
[1:00:43] fussing they just went together made the
[1:00:45] temple of God that's right I believe
[1:00:47] that God is cutting out everywhere Born
[1:00:48] Again children of God and going to bring
[1:00:50] them together Glory I may not live to
[1:00:52] see it but I hope I do of course he
[1:00:54] didn't live to see it but I hope we live
[1:00:56] to see
[1:00:57] it but someday now here's where he
[1:00:59] prophesy you remember there's young
[1:01:01] people sitting here someday these
[1:01:03] denominational barriers look what he
[1:01:04] says what what kind of
[1:01:07] barriers denominational barriers that
[1:01:09] struck me I mean I've heard this quote
[1:01:11] for years I made a video of it 13 10
[1:01:14] years ago but he said one day these
[1:01:17] denominational bears that we
[1:01:20] have and Fanatics you ever hear some
[1:01:23] Fanatics around the message
[1:01:26] sometimes they call us
[1:01:28] Fanatics I'm a fanatic for
[1:01:31] Jesus I'm a fanatic for everywhere in
[1:01:33] that Bible praise God
[1:01:35] hallelujah there are some Fanatics
[1:01:37] around the
[1:01:39] message someday those barriers now to me
[1:01:41] those Den if he's talking about
[1:01:43] denominational that's got to be a
[1:01:46] deed denominational
[1:01:49] barriers that they scooped around and
[1:01:51] separated people you ever seen people uh
[1:01:53] you know Naomi and be I talk about time
[1:01:55] preachers that will separate a church
[1:01:58] they'll split a church over something
[1:02:01] small brother says someday people that
[1:02:03] have separated people some someday those
[1:02:06] Bears will be taken away and God will
[1:02:08] bring his church together oh and take it
[1:02:10] hold just as certain as anything what's
[1:02:13] the example Solomon all those stones
[1:02:15] were cut out and then shipped right to
[1:02:18] Jerusalem so Solomon could place him in
[1:02:20] there with his uh anointed men that had
[1:02:22] the Holy Ghost anointed you're place
[1:02:24] here your Ephesus your samna your
[1:02:26] pergamos your thy your Sardis your
[1:02:28] Philadelphian here we are all these L SE
[1:02:30] of stones coming together for the rure
[1:02:32] amen I'm glad I put right next to you
[1:02:34] brother I put right next to you brother
[1:02:36] martin we're all put there together
[1:02:38] ready for this body to be finished and
[1:02:40] then the spirit of God will fall
[1:02:42] hallelujah amen Oh Glory Hallelujah
[1:02:45] they're going to come that's prophecy
[1:02:48] remember that I spoke that in the name
[1:02:50] of the Lord Lord now you can put that
[1:02:52] down on on the book now that was is
[1:02:55] true that's thus say the Lord God is
[1:02:58] going to break down denominational
[1:03:00] bearers now to me now I put in my that's
[1:03:02] my idea I think he means these and
[1:03:04] nicadan because Peter had some and he
[1:03:06] was a holy ghost filled saint but look
[1:03:09] how God broke it down most of us we
[1:03:11] don't want God to break us down like
[1:03:13] Peter got broke down right right we want
[1:03:15] God to break us down at home when no
[1:03:17] one's
[1:03:18] around right we don't want the preacher
[1:03:20] to come up and blast you did it you did
[1:03:24] we don't like that so much but Peter had
[1:03:26] to suffer through
[1:03:28] it to me it don't matter as long as I'm
[1:03:30] a stone amen I just want to be there
[1:03:33] praise God Amen what Lord whatever you
[1:03:35] got to break down in my life just break
[1:03:37] it down I want to be part of that Temple
[1:03:40] hallelujah amen amen I don't want to be
[1:03:42] left in the tribulation I want to go up
[1:03:44] to heaven as the body of Christ as a
[1:03:47] portion of that body of Jesus
[1:03:50] Christen well Raam said look I didn't
[1:03:52] know I was going to say that that's
[1:03:54] right that God will bring a church
[1:03:55] together you can depend on that as long
[1:03:57] as you argue and fuss with one another
[1:03:59] you're in
[1:04:00] kindergarten see I don't argue and fuss
[1:04:02] with people but I do reason with them
[1:04:03] like Paul did I don't argue and
[1:04:07] fuss God will keep you there until you
[1:04:09] learn enough to get out of it that's all
[1:04:11] amen well praise the Lord all right
[1:04:12] that's right get out have faith step out
[1:04:14] on the word of God and look now I give
[1:04:16] some examples from the Bible some more
[1:04:18] examples the disciples said we seen one
[1:04:20] casting out devils and we forbid him
[1:04:22] there starts your denomination again I
[1:04:25] yes in other words anybody says you
[1:04:27] don't belong to my message Church you're
[1:04:28] not a part of it that's a devil that's
[1:04:31] the Antichrist Spirit you don't belong
[1:04:34] to our group you ain't a holy ghost
[1:04:35] filled Christian that's the devil that
[1:04:37] says
[1:04:38] it
[1:04:41] right said forbid him not amen be one
[1:04:44] with him that's all go join up if they
[1:04:46] won't join up don't forbid him go on
[1:04:48] that's the way to do it
[1:04:52] yes and right about 8 o' so pretty good
[1:04:56] timing there by God's grace H I'm just
[1:04:58] happy my voice about going out too I
[1:05:00] done preach my voice out again remember
[1:05:03] brother uh preached invisible Union of
[1:05:06] the Bride of Jesus Christ he preached it
[1:05:08] right around Thanksgiving brother R said
[1:05:10] talk about a
[1:05:11] Thanksgiving brother Brown preaches a
[1:05:13] sermon called The Invisible Union of the
[1:05:15] Bride of Jesus Christ and at the end he
[1:05:17] says this doesn't might not sound like a
[1:05:18] Thanksgiving message to you he said but
[1:05:21] he said talk about Thanksgiving he said
[1:05:23] I'm more thankful for that than anything
[1:05:25] I
[1:05:27] know so this tonight overcoming the
[1:05:29] Deeds of nicas might not sound like a
[1:05:31] Thanksgiving message but I'm more
[1:05:33] thankful to overcome the Deeds of nickan
[1:05:36] than anything else I know other words
[1:05:38] I'm so thankful to overcome the
[1:05:40] Antichrist spirit that I can just be
[1:05:42] pleasing to the Holy Spirit God talk
[1:05:45] about
[1:05:47] Thanksgiving Hallelujah Glory hallelujah
[1:05:50] thank you
[1:05:51] Jesus talk about it next year here's the
[1:05:53] quote says he the bridegroom took away
[1:05:56] your shame amen and put it in the sea of
[1:05:59] forgetfulness by the washing of the
[1:06:01] water of the word and the blood of life
[1:06:04] amen that's what the Bible said see
[1:06:07] everything I preach up here that's what
[1:06:08] the Bible says amen amen these people
[1:06:10] try to tell me brother didn't preach the
[1:06:12] Bible I said you have not listened
[1:06:14] enough you have not read my book and you
[1:06:17] probably won't well I just had another
[1:06:18] preacher say this weekend bless his
[1:06:20] heart he might be listening but he said
[1:06:21] well your book's too long I don't have
[1:06:22] time to read it
[1:06:25] now to me when I will I'll listen to
[1:06:28] their stuff I'll study their stuff when
[1:06:29] they won't study mine that shows me
[1:06:30] they're really not interested in the
[1:06:32] truth if you really cared about my soul
[1:06:35] you try to correct
[1:06:36] me because that's what love does love is
[1:06:40] corrective the church said amen not one
[1:06:43] of them sister be I've offered the
[1:06:45] famous guys that left the message I've
[1:06:46] offered the non famous guys not a one of
[1:06:48] them will even open up my book to see
[1:06:50] what's inside of it because they're
[1:06:52] scared of it
[1:06:54] and these people that watch my videos I
[1:06:55] just enough these people watch my videos
[1:06:58] and they send Clips to these people that
[1:06:59] left the message and say oh this pastor
[1:07:01] doesn't know what he's talking about
[1:07:03] what that's because they take me out of
[1:07:05] context if they would take all the Bible
[1:07:07] verses I preach if they would take all
[1:07:09] the Bible verses and quotes and put them
[1:07:11] together they would know and they would
[1:07:12] see they're probably going to use this
[1:07:13] clip sometime they would see that
[1:07:16] they're wrong they're off the word and
[1:07:17] brother Ram was a genuine prophet of God
[1:07:19] I've got over 900 pages on it my two
[1:07:21] books when are they going to really
[1:07:23] honestly read research these things I'll
[1:07:25] be waiting in my inbox to get an email
[1:07:27] from them
[1:07:28] amen but I got a strange feeling girls
[1:07:31] they're not going to email me about it
[1:07:32] they're just going to make videos about
[1:07:33] me and make fun of me do whatever you
[1:07:35] want I'd Rather Have Jesus amen am I
[1:07:39] know what I believe Glory I've got
[1:07:41] scriptures to back up with I believe
[1:07:43] they say brother R never preached a
[1:07:45] Doctrine he only taught you know his
[1:07:47] stories what a bunch of nonsense right
[1:07:51] how about this one is he using stories
[1:07:53] here to try to get you to understand
[1:07:54] you're the bride of Christ he's using
[1:07:56] Bible verses amen he's using Micah 7:19
[1:08:01] he's using Ephesians 5:24 he's using
[1:08:04] Romans 51 he's using Romans 7:3 church
[1:08:08] and if you believe that word then you
[1:08:10] are the Bride of Jesus Christ amen
[1:08:12] because that's what the bride does she
[1:08:14] believes all the word she's washing all
[1:08:16] the word of God your smile proves you're
[1:08:19] washing the word brother your love to
[1:08:21] say Amen proves you're washing the word
[1:08:24] of God am
[1:08:28] Hallelujah your first husband that
[1:08:30] you're married to the world the anointed
[1:08:32] badroom which for ordained you has
[1:08:34] washed you by the washing of the word by
[1:08:36] the church no this church can't wash you
[1:08:39] right I can't wash you only Christ can
[1:08:41] wash
[1:08:42] you we're not washed by the church now
[1:08:45] you get you get some good baths here
[1:08:46] when the Holy Ghost is here but there's
[1:08:49] no man or preacher or song leader nobody
[1:08:51] can wash you except Christ amen
[1:08:54] amen that do sound right does it you're
[1:08:57] Washed by the Water of the church that
[1:08:58] don't sound right you might find that in
[1:09:00] the almanac but that's not in God's
