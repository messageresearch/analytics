[19:26] even aiming if you've ever requested if
[19:29] you now salutes by God's grace but you
[19:33] know you might be in for the request in
[19:35] just a moment I've got a few requests
[19:37] here let me do the announcements first
[19:41] year by God's grace so I don't forget
[19:46] the first announcement is you have I
[19:49] bought a card back there for brother
[19:50] John his family's out traveling they're
[19:53] having a vacation this weekend likely to
[19:55] sign in thanking for his 11 years as the
[19:58] church officer just say thank you or god
[20:01] bless you or thank you for your service
[20:02] I haven't signed it yet but I thought
[20:03] I'd set it out there
[20:04] after service you try to do that
[20:06] actually work out if it wasn't here
[20:08] today this family was out traveling
[20:09] couldn't do it last week is easier one
[20:13] of the situation's so if you would do
[20:15] that I appreciate that also once brother
[20:20] Lawrence does his special I just had a
[20:22] little sheet here last year I passed
[20:24] these same sheets out I just said if you
[20:25] have any questions this is like the
[20:28] middle of the year it's nice to you know
[20:30] stop in the middle of the year and see
[20:31] if there's any questions about any
[20:33] sermon content or anything like that
[20:35] there's three things on here the first
[20:37] one is you have any suggestions for Van
[20:39] Nuys the church officers and the Deacons
[20:42] think do anything better
[20:43] does the pastor you do anything better
[20:46] so if you have any suggestions or the
[20:49] trustees there's anything physical with
[20:51] the building we could do better
[20:53] you would like your suggestions on that
[20:54] or if you're interested in serving in a
[20:56] in a office and you meet the
[20:58] qualifications you know your let me know
[21:00] about that
[21:01] the second thing is questions and
[21:03] answers last year I hand them out I
[21:05] didn't get any back so I guess that's
[21:06] good I guess nobody has any questions
[21:08] about what we're preaching I hope it
[21:10] hope it's clear by God's grace that's
[21:12] what we want the Holy Spirit to do is
[21:14] dissolve all doubts then third one if
[21:17] you desire meeting with me or just some
[21:18] fellowship with me I know my most of my
[21:21] fellowship comes on Sunday between
[21:23] services and after second service that's
[21:25] the most time I have for fellowship
[21:27] because we're quite busy during the week
[21:28] with mid week six children and things
[21:31] like that but it would like just a
[21:33] meeting a fellowship I want to talk
[21:34] about any questions you have happy to do
[21:37] that so I'm gonna give everybody
[21:37] actually the paper and Loras gives his
[21:40] song special here that's great so those
[21:43] are the two announcements also I can
[21:46] read our visitors but Ivan and sister
[21:48] Donna let's give them around poverty
[21:54] bless them so our prayer request for the
[21:57] Amen is going to come prairies in just a
[21:59] moment and why don't we stand here we'll
[22:00] pray for these as we stand I'll keep my
[22:03] family in prayer we've had a lot of
[22:04] sickness a lot of stomach trouble
[22:07] because our family that's why they're

[44:16] order to know how much you loved us and
[44:18] how you showed it through the cross
[44:20] through the Holy Ghost as well more
[44:22] we're grateful this morning or as as you
[44:25] said Lord with your on the earth you
[44:26] said the Holy Spirit would bring all
[44:28] things to our remembrance let's do that
[44:31] this morning Lord we've heard a lot and
[44:33] we've read aloud you're studying a lot
[44:35] in our view we know a lot north
[44:37] perhaps but father bring what we have
[44:39] need up to remembrance this morning or
[44:41] what would be needful in this our Lord
[44:43] Jesus we give you glory use it as a
[44:46] vessel bless your people Lord God we're
[44:48] here in your presence to soar with you
[44:51] raise us up Lord set a win to the Holy
[44:53] Spirit that we can stretch our wings and
[44:56] fly or not with you this morning speak
[44:58] to us through thy word Lord as it has
[45:01] never failed Lord we expect you to move
[45:03] Lord we look or to your sphere moving
[45:05] amongst us here we thank you for it in
[45:08] Jesus Christ's name
[45:09] to reset the study bodies this morning
[45:12] praise the Lord
[45:14] let's go I want to look at the series of
[45:20] the baptism of the Holy Ghost we'll go
[45:22] back to that this morning or just kind
[45:24] of in another and a different sermon I
[45:26] was going to priests last night but then
[45:27] this morning I woke up and prayed and I
[45:29] just felt led to go this direction so
[45:30] I'm gonna go with this let's go to
[45:32] Psalms 104
[45:34] verse 15 s are there Psalms 104 15 over
[45:46] Luke 536 was one of 415 I don't have any
[45:51] slides today or quotes I prepared all
[45:54] that yesterday I thought I was going to
[45:55] preach that message I just got notes and
[45:58] you don't have to look at me today or
[45:59] close your eyes and pray or something
[46:01] like that but thankful for God's grace
[46:05] appreciate the Saints pressure up to the
[46:07] house of God to be like to preach on the
[46:10] oil in the line today by God's grace I
[46:12] can determine that's kind of what
[46:13] message has been on the heart this
[46:15] morning so I can preset Psalms 104 verse
[46:21] 15 of course we're going to take a type
[46:22] out of this not a natural application
[46:26] although it could be you know but to the
[46:30] spiritual side of this Psalm 104 verse
[46:32] 13 and why that maketh glad the heart of
[46:35] man and oil to make his face to shine
[46:39] and bread which strengtheneth the man's
[46:45] heart you want to look at all these in
[46:47] the spiritual aspect the wine today
[46:50] because we would only take natural wine
[46:52] if it was communion well it's not going
[46:53] mean in Sunday so I'm going to look at
[46:55] this in the in the fact the avenue of
[46:57] the Holy Spirit is wine and the oil not
[47:01] so much talking about our natural basis
[47:03] but our spiritual base our presence and
[47:06] then the bread of course which is God's
[47:08] Word amen let's go to Luke chapter 5 36
[47:28] and he speak also a parable unto them no
[47:30] man where the piece of a new garment
[47:32] upon an old if otherwise then both the
[47:36] new maketh a rent and the piece that was
[47:38] taken out of the new agree if not with
[47:41] the old and no man put his new wine into
[47:45] old bottles else the new wine will
[47:48] the bottles and be spilled and the
[47:51] bottles Shall Perish but new wine must
[47:54] be put into new bottles and both are
[47:57] preserved no man also having drunk old
[48:00] wine straightway desired new where he
[48:02] saith the old is better name as far as
[48:06] one more time forward prayer don't need
[48:08] on your hearts make it unto God Heavenly
[48:11] Father or my hands up I've need of you
[48:12] Lord
[48:13] that's your people this morning
[48:15] physically those present here in the
[48:17] building and those live-streaming father
[48:19] may we feel your presence and we rejoice
[48:21] in your presence let me just be Lord a
[48:23] vessel channel each one of us Morgan the
[48:26] channel of faith Lord God to receive the
[48:29] promises or to believe the promise mode
[48:32] we just thank you for this time father
[48:34] that your spirit dwell amongst us now
[48:36] Lord as we look to you Lord you said
[48:39] faith comes by hearing hearing by the
[48:41] word of guys nor we hear your words this
[48:44] morning help us to hear them and believe
[48:46] them Lord and you know they'll take
[48:48] effect we thank you for that in Jesus
[48:50] Christ's name
[48:51] everything how about if she pays
[48:53] increase I think it's been quite a while
[49:02] since I preached on the oil line so I
[49:04] just got to felt led to to go this
[49:06] direction this morning the last time I
[49:09] preached on the the batches of Holy
[49:11] Ghost series was last month so I'd like
[49:13] to pick that back up again I still got a
[49:15] lot to do but I want look at oil mine
[49:19] this morning a Wednesday night if you
[49:21] didn't this and that I think you'd be
[49:22] blessed we looked at the last message of
[49:24] the thirteen church age and looked at
[49:27] stars at the end on Christ is the
[49:28] morning star hope you enjoy that and
[49:30] that was a wonderful
[49:31] I left stirred up I stayed stirred up
[49:34] amen
[49:35] I've been stirred up so very thankful
[49:37] that could mean one of God's stars amen
[49:40] but ultimately Christ is the warning
[49:42] star praise the Lord the great star the
[49:44] North Star so let's look at this star
[49:47] here this morning oil light and then
[49:52] more willing tonight we have another
[49:53] service Lord willing at four o'clock by
[49:55] God's grace I was feeling sick this
[49:58] morning as well but I feel a lot better
[49:59] now
[50:00] must be the anointing but I'm trusting
[50:03] that I'll be able to minister again at 4
[50:05] o'clock by God's grace so let's just
[50:09] trust the Lord to give us His mercy
[50:11] today so let's look at oil wine again if
[50:14] you're familiar you know with the
[50:16] message your brother Brandon you know
[50:18] the majority of the times he preached on
[50:20] the oil wine was in 1963 during the
[50:24] series of the seven seals we know by
[50:27] God's grace so if you look it up there I
[50:29] think there's 22 hits in 1963 the other
[50:31] years just have a few hits every now and
[50:33] then but he started preaching a pretty
[50:36] heavy of course in the seals the third
[50:38] seal and four seal and then had a lot of
[50:40] questions and the questions and answers
[50:42] on this seal how many know that the
[50:45] seals were given to us with the state
[50:47] the law and the revelation behind the
[50:50] symbol none I have any word and that's
[50:52] what Christians need to understand that
[50:54] follow the message not every word
[50:55] brother Brandon ever said was the state
[50:58] the Lord because he said I'm not
[51:00] infallible right brother Branham said
[51:02] that he said I'm not infallible he said
[51:04] in fact if you call me infallible
[51:07] brother Branham said that's one of the
[51:08] most awfulest things you can do so I'll
[51:11] be showing folks on that recently
[51:12] brother Branham was infallible but when
[51:15] God would tell him what the word meant
[51:17] that's in family and so that's what we
[51:20] had with the seven seals and that's why
[51:22] I mean so much to us the seven seals of
[51:25] the seven Church ages because it's God's
[51:28] interpretation of his own word through a
[51:30] prophet and God said surely if I do
[51:32] anything I'll do nothing except I give
[51:34] my secret to my servants the prophets
[51:36] and so we're thankful that God has given
[51:39] us the revelation of this hour and what
[51:41] is it there for to do the seals were
[51:44] there to show us the four works of Satan
[51:46] that we might overcome that praise the
[51:49] Lord and the church age is broken
[51:51] document further the four before horse
[51:53] riders and four anointings you know we
[51:54] we take all the anointing of the ego in
[51:56] our day but in every man's day had a
[51:59] different anointing right before
[52:00] anointings
[52:01] that's why this seals means so much to
[52:03] us now the church ages is just the more
[52:05] detailed look at those anointed right as
[52:08] we've been seeing that with by tira
[52:09] any of those believers were under that
[52:12] oxen team they freely
[52:14] their lives they increase their work
[52:16] just like an ox works really hard right
[52:18] a cow we work really hard you don't
[52:20] because they're beasts of burden so the
[52:24] church ages gives us a more detailed
[52:26] look that's why we're blessed to go
[52:27] through that and I can said last week
[52:30] you know if we're not interested in
[52:31] church ages now we would have been
[52:32] interested in 1960 right so we got to be
[52:35] hungry and thirsting on the Word of God
[52:37] which we are amen and though as I told
[52:40] you Turkey has have to trust me and
[52:41] maybe on that day God showed you but
[52:43] these church Angels have truly given us
[52:46] understanding of where our church is
[52:48] right now yeah yeah because the the
[52:51] faithful those that are pressing on the
[52:53] overcomers are overcoming all those
[52:55] temptations that we've been preaching on
[52:57] and you've heard me as a pastor and
[52:59] you'll get used to it you know you
[53:01] father's are you ready if you have
[53:02] children you have to deal with some of
[53:04] the same things over and over again
[53:06] right fathers grandfathers yep yeah you
[53:10] sometimes you have to deal with things
[53:11] mother's let the deal with things over
[53:13] and over stop some of that sometimes the
[53:16] problems just don't disappear how many
[53:18] know that you have to deal with
[53:19] situations again and again what is it
[53:22] doing it's building your faith it's
[53:25] testing your patience and so as a pastor
[53:28] you hurt me you don't preach all things
[53:29] over and over again a lot like church
[53:31] attendance right and faithfulness and
[53:34] tidying it love for God and worshiping
[53:36] God and coming to the house of God
[53:38] leasing but I've got to do that because
[53:41] that's what the church ages are all
[53:42] that's one of the main things about the
[53:44] church changes is being in the house of
[53:46] God loving God and serving God right
[53:48] it's one of the most important things
[53:50] and I hope that's been made clear I've
[53:53] just but and I had to stop this morning
[53:57] if you just bear with me you remember in
[53:58] acts 20 when Paul was leaving Ephesus
[54:01] what'd he do he warned down for three
[54:03] years with tears that wolves would come
[54:06] in I remember that from the scripture
[54:08] the Bible said day and night he warned
[54:11] them with tears that was were coming now
[54:13] bite of a master if I focus on something
[54:16] for six months
[54:17] or I gotta warn the church for six eight
[54:20] months or five months or two months and
[54:22] I hope you'll bear with me by God's
[54:24] grace because we've got different things
[54:26] attack the church
[54:27] if you've been watching the church as a
[54:29] whole you know and so we're just trying
[54:31] by the Holy Spirit to stay with the Word
[54:33] of God and it just shows you that I love
[54:35] you that I try to keep you away from
[54:37] those things number my backside Illinois
[54:39] one man and one woman with the poison of
[54:42] sin and that the neck it'll be a cancer
[54:45] and he'll try to say we'll try to spread
[54:47] that through the whole church but
[54:50] brother Branham said you just love them
[54:51] he said either that person more debt and
[54:53] be one of you or God will drive them
[54:54] away
[54:56] you understand that by God's grace so
[54:59] see I'm aware of thing I'm aware of
[55:00] situations and what we're trying to do
[55:02] we're trying to keep the poison out
[55:04] we're trying to keep divine love as our
[55:07] weapon praise God divine life so I just
[55:11] want to start with that now oil and wine
[55:14] there's a lot of great quotations on
[55:17] this which we'll get to some of them of
[55:18] course you won't be able to finish it
[55:19] all by the grace of Lord but we started
[55:22] off in the natural I want to look at
[55:24] some scripture Mike and just let me um
[55:27] if I can just a moment let me just read
[55:30] a short quotation and questions answers
[55:32] on the seals
[55:33] yes brother grant what does oil and
[55:35] whitening and questions answers on the
[55:37] seals
[55:37] he said oil as we took in a symbol means
[55:40] the Holy Spirit wine and oil is
[55:43] connected together the Bible we know
[55:45] that there's 40 verses where why did I
[55:49] are in the same verse raised the large
[55:52] just like wisdom and knowledge if you
[55:54] look a lookup wizard now sometimes
[55:56] you'll find I think there's 80 or 90
[55:58] scriptures on wisdom and knowledge they
[55:59] always go together because they're
[56:02] connected together you can't happened it
[56:04] you can't have a wisdom of God's you
[56:07] have the knowledge of God you can't you
[56:09] have to first know what the Bible says
[56:10] then you get wisdom so it is with the
[56:14] Holy Ghost you have to have the baptism
[56:15] of the Holy Ghost right and that brings
[56:18] stimulation of Revelation
[56:19] that's exactly right through David Laury
[56:23] I said in why he said the stimulation
[56:27] wine stimulates now I felt like was it
[56:31] depressant but I'm going to show you
[56:33] some science here from an article I
[56:35] found just this morning that says wine
[56:36] is actually a stimulant that was really
[56:39] good as from 2017
[56:41] program said what stimulates the church
[56:43] so if I ask you much stimulates you know
[56:45] what your editor ah to be revelation any
[56:47] man revelation means the unveiling of
[56:50] the truth amen
[56:51] so when something you didn't know before
[56:52] and God makes it known to you and all to
[56:55] make you really excited a man all right
[56:57] right because that's the operation of
[57:00] the line he's to stimulate you by God
[57:03] availing something you didn't know
[57:05] before it might be something personal
[57:07] maybe something that might not be so
[57:09] maybe maybe at the Bible you are aware
[57:11] of but just how that situation applies
[57:14] to your life amen
[57:16] or maybe something I never go to this
[57:17] about that I never knew this parable
[57:19] type that I never knew that Old
[57:21] Testament character roof type this I
[57:23] never knew that so it can work cover God
[57:27] implanted to work like last Sunday I got
[57:29] a good stimulation in artuz EQ where it
[57:32] set on those feast days you can't go in
[57:34] and go out the same way when you come
[57:36] into the outer core you have to leave a
[57:39] different way that you came there was
[57:41] too many people for you to turn around
[57:44] you know the outer court go worship and
[57:46] then you'll just back out there's too
[57:49] many people
[57:49] the one the way you came in you had to
[57:52] go out a different way and that's my
[57:53] brother Graham said you can't leave this
[57:55] service different or you can't leave
[57:56] even the same you got to leave different
[57:58] praise God and also the other idea was
[58:01] they don't want you to turn your back
[58:01] you know to the to the sacrifices they
[58:04] always lend you to face it um they want
[58:06] you to turn around if you go out the
[58:07] same way we always want to put our face
[58:09] towards God's face how many want to look
[58:11] in the face of God again you're holding
[58:13] this night but I look into your face my
[58:15] look into your presence a bit so that's
[58:18] to me that's revelation that stimulates
[58:20] that stimulates me I want to read the
[58:21] Bible more because I can see more Troost
[58:24] through those golden nuggets we'd say or
[58:27] those types and shadows for our day I
[58:29] love the day met that's why I love the
[58:31] Word of God was constantly unfolding now
[58:35] program said oil wine went together he
[58:37] said in the church worship notice
[58:41] assemble together connected together so
[58:44] when we're together oil and wine needs
[58:47] to go together
[58:48] there you go today I said if you got a
[58:51] concordance you look and see the whole
[58:52] thing wine oil is met together worship
[58:54] if you got it crew didn't why it says it
[58:56] there I notice this oil is always the
[58:59] Holy Spirit we find that in Ezekiel he
[59:03] said we find it on the New Testament why
[59:05] do we anoint the sick with oil we annoy
[59:08] the sick with oil because it symbolizes
[59:09] the pouring out of the Holy Spirit of
[59:11] all men the wise virgin had oil the
[59:15] unwise had no oil spirit see that is the
[59:18] oil and then the why did the oil
[59:20] represents God God is the spirit he said
[59:24] I didn't know that the other day so
[59:25] sitting there he said what does the oil
[59:27] line represent see that you hurt that
[59:30] that was the black horse rider and that
[59:33] was during the time of the Dark Age my
[59:36] man said I believe if you get that the
[59:38] third seal tape you'll find it there
[59:41] these gods as we understand it by God's
[59:43] grace oil is the Holy Spirit wide is the
[59:47] stimulation of Revelation praise God
[59:50] now here's the art of God isn't
[59:51] mentioned here I want to read this real
[59:53] quick it was on NPR that's also on CBS
[59:57] News it was a Pro 80th this year it said
[59:59] are you looking to give your brain a
[1:00:01] workout just pour yourself a glass of
[1:00:03] wine now we don't do that except for
[1:00:05] communion a scientist from Yale School
[1:00:08] of Medicine says drinking red or white
[1:00:11] wine sparks a reaction in both the
[1:00:13] sensory and emotional parts of the brain
[1:00:17] glory hallelujah your senses see your
[1:00:23] five senses and then your emotions are
[1:00:25] touched when they're affected when you
[1:00:28] drink wine haha oh yeah essentially when
[1:00:32] we're sipping our favorite vintage now
[1:00:34] of course we're talking about Holy Ghost
[1:00:36] now it takes the brain a lot of work to
[1:00:39] process exactly what we're drinking the
[1:00:42] brain activity is similar to if you're
[1:00:44] solving an equation you never try to
[1:00:46] solve something you're mounted and plan
[1:00:47] something out or coming up with a
[1:00:50] solution to a problem so when a person
[1:00:54] drinks national wine it's like their
[1:00:56] brain is trying to solve a problem and
[1:00:58] all their senses are X
[1:00:59] sighs and you're ready to solve the
[1:01:01] problem I like how that sound oh you
[1:01:04] when you get a good drink of the Holy
[1:01:06] Ghost what's it make you dude solve the
[1:01:07] problem that Satan's placed in your life
[1:01:09] I with me you're a mole ready to have
[1:01:13] your senses exercised towards the things
[1:01:16] of God when we're drinking off the line
[1:01:18] of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:01:20] I notice it also it affects your
[1:01:22] emotions that's why you have emotional
[1:01:25] drugs right and that's why I gotta have
[1:01:27] some when the Holy Ghost Falls it has
[1:01:29] the same effect as a drunk man in the
[1:01:32] natural as it would in the spiritual
[1:01:34] brother ramsett you don't look for
[1:01:36] emotion when the Holy Ghost Falls but it
[1:01:38] comes with it hey just like that's right
[1:01:41] that's right moves your emotions so does
[1:01:44] the Holy Ghost Rooter motion I'm
[1:01:46] starting to get happy now ain't it you
[1:01:48] see because it starts but you talk about
[1:01:49] God
[1:01:50] you start getting happy because God is
[1:01:52] love God is not depression not his
[1:01:56] victory in enemy God's love amen
[1:01:59] thank you Jesus he's love and that's
[1:02:03] what our scripture said it number the
[1:02:04] Bible said oil makes his face to shine
[1:02:08] what me Steve is so different when they
[1:02:11] stoned him he had the face of an angel
[1:02:13] and at the base the devil's both thought
[1:02:16] their doctrine was right like you saw
[1:02:17] Wednesday both will say their doctrines
[1:02:20] right but only one of them was right and
[1:02:22] the man with the angel anointing on his
[1:02:25] face the man with the oil rubbed upon
[1:02:27] his face at the Holy Ghost upon him that
[1:02:30] was the true believer amen
[1:02:32] remember your face represents the
[1:02:34] presence right so when we say oh we have
[1:02:37] the line I'm sorry when the oil when the
[1:02:40] oil rubbed upon our face it means the
[1:02:42] Holy Spirit is our pet is on our
[1:02:44] countenance in other words when you look
[1:02:47] at somebody you should see a real
[1:02:48] believer in man you should see somebody
[1:02:50] who's fighting for Christ someone who's
[1:02:52] in love with Christ you should see
[1:02:54] someone who is walking in the spirit
[1:02:56] amen to that because it's rubbed upon
[1:03:00] the face just like the natural benefits
[1:03:01] to oil there's you know my wife wrote a
[1:03:04] book on essential oil so I didn't ask
[1:03:06] her but part Brisas I promise you that
[1:03:07] but uh but I just his thought was kind
[1:03:11] of inspired to me this morning
[1:03:12] knows I have much time to talk Danny by
[1:03:13] the support but there's many effects to
[1:03:17] the natural oil as you know there's a
[1:03:19] Roma therapy topical therapy cooking and
[1:03:22] vitamin e D and others there's so many
[1:03:24] benefits to oils there's healthy oils
[1:03:26] that are unhealthy oils but oils have
[1:03:29] such amazing effect upon the individual
[1:03:33] it touches every area of a person's
[1:03:36] health let me know that oils you can
[1:03:38] smell them in you can rub them on you
[1:03:41] can eat them you know that they minister
[1:03:44] to the whole body you believe that
[1:03:46] and then why simulates the brain and why
[1:03:50] i stimulate your mind
[1:03:51] no wonder the Bible said be renewed in
[1:03:54] the spirit of your mind see you need to
[1:03:57] wait when your vibe is is weak and
[1:03:59] you're struggling and my battles we need
[1:04:02] a good drink of wine praise God that
[1:04:04] will help us to solve the problem that
[1:04:06] Satan's put in front of us that's
[1:04:09] exactly right
[1:04:09] being renewed in the spirit of my number
[1:04:11] don't forget this and greatest by the
[1:04:13] overflow I was listening to this week
[1:04:14] brother branham said the battlefield is
[1:04:17] your mind and he said it's a no-man's
[1:04:19] land let me know that so see your mind
[1:04:23] is such a delicate place Church it's a
[1:04:25] no man advantage it's not a place that
[1:04:27] it's not a good place to 12
[1:04:28] unless God's presence is there our
[1:04:31] thoughts can cause us to lose sleep
[1:04:33] right worry our thoughts can cause us to
[1:04:36] be fearful and anticipate things that
[1:04:39] aren't even going to happen right jump
[1:04:41] into conclusions our minds can get still
[1:04:43] so bent on something that we can't get
[1:04:45] out of it right we just we're directing
[1:04:48] a certain way I've just got to buy this
[1:04:49] I'm just going to go to this we just got
[1:04:52] to do that it's a no man's land the mind
[1:04:54] is a very dangerous place
[1:04:56] that's why Satan attacks even in the
[1:04:58] mind but we need God's anointing we need
[1:05:01] to drink on the Spirit of God that will
[1:05:03] stimulate our minds to solve the problem
[1:05:06] brother have said God's children have
[1:05:08] the devil's answer to this question amen
[1:05:10] so the Holy Spirit gives always gives us
[1:05:13] the answer to Satan's questions how to
[1:05:15] do you but does anybody love you are you
[1:05:18] good for anything does God even care
[1:05:20] about you the Holy Ghost has all the
[1:05:22] answers to solve all your problems
[1:05:24] will you be healed or not the Holy Ghost
[1:05:27] has an answer a man every word of God is
[1:05:30] he a man under the video it's exactly
[1:05:33] right now I'm not having time I don't
[1:05:38] want to spend most of my time on on
[1:05:39] these scriptures on all the scriptures
[1:05:43] like I said there's over 40 but I just
[1:05:46] want to hit a few highlights here by the
[1:05:48] grace of the Lord
[1:05:49] why makes the glad the heart of a man
[1:05:54] but see when you see people happy in the
[1:05:56] lore what's happened they've drunk it up
[1:05:58] the line of God
[1:05:59] right they're happy in the Lord and the
[1:06:02] Bible said I'm Mary Hart makes good
[1:06:03] medicine right that's why you see
[1:06:06] billboards they'll put children's smiles
[1:06:08] on billboards why would they do that why
[1:06:11] would they put somebody smiling you know
[1:06:12] for a hospital side we don't smile and
[1:06:15] go to the hospital it's usually a
[1:06:17] problem we go to the hospital right why
[1:06:19] do they put that there because a smile
[1:06:21] can change an atmosphere right the joy
[1:06:24] and evanescent natural joy but what
[1:06:27] about a spiritual joy praise God why
[1:06:30] makes glad the heart of man and you've
[1:06:34] heard I don't have it in front of me but
[1:06:35] I've read studies where wine is good for
[1:06:36] the heart if you had my wine in
[1:06:38] moderation
[1:06:38] that's why would you continue that's one
[1:06:40] reason of communion that's not the only
[1:06:42] reason that just one a small reason
[1:06:43] light of itself is a good thing but we
[1:06:46] must have temperance praise God it's
[1:06:49] exactly right
[1:06:50] oil makes the faces shine and then that
[1:06:53] last person I guess not much on time
[1:06:54] because I just preach on that lot but
[1:06:56] the bread which strengtheneth the man's
[1:06:58] heart so wine makes your heart glad and
[1:07:02] bread get your heart rate so gladness to
[1:07:07] the art through the wine and then
[1:07:09] strength through the bread or the Word
[1:07:11] of God I'm about to trip but when I come
[1:07:13] and hear the word of God I come and
[1:07:14] preach the Word of God and I get under
[1:07:16] the anointing of God I get stronger I
[1:07:19] don't get weaker I don't I don't start
[1:07:22] as quote no dowdy clothes I don't start
[1:07:24] doubting or quoting safety then this
[1:07:26] Dallas I just keep quoting the Word of
[1:07:28] God amen that's what it does is the real
[1:07:31] bread of God strengthened to heart and
[1:07:33] then when the wise there makes you happy
[1:07:35] in the Lord amen
[1:07:36] thank you lord now I'm going to read out
[1:07:39] of Easton's Bible dictionary because
[1:07:40] mother Graham said he was reading
[1:07:41] curtains Bible dictionary but it says
[1:07:45] olive oil seems to be most used amongst
[1:07:48] the Hebrews it had many purposes it
[1:07:50] anoints the body or the hair so you
[1:07:54] anoint the body with oil good type of
[1:07:56] the Holy Spirit now like this one a damn
[1:07:58] time to study on this one but maybe
[1:08:00] later the oil and wine were using
[1:08:02] numerous offerings such as the meat
[1:08:04] offering right
[1:08:08] there was other ones too oh yeah the
[1:08:10] daily sacrifice always they had to have
[1:08:12] wine and oil okay you see that church
[1:08:14] how important is for us to be glad every
[1:08:16] single day I'm just a lord help me with
[1:08:18] that to be happy every day help me to
[1:08:21] offer sacrifice a man of Prayer so I can
[1:08:25] have oil I can offer oh I don't mind
[1:08:27] every single day amen
[1:08:28] it was a daily worship and then it was a
[1:08:32] meat offering worship which were
[1:08:33] scheduled you know those were different
[1:08:34] scheduled of feasts and some were like
[1:08:36] that and remember it was a meat offering
[1:08:38] but there's no heat involved it was
[1:08:40] actually bread which is what more
[1:08:44] fellowship more communion with Christ
[1:08:45] and I like that amen
[1:08:48] because his bread is neat it is deep
[1:08:52] it's rich holiday all right
[1:08:54] amen I just want you to say that I want
[1:08:57] you to stop for a moment and think about
[1:08:59] that our offerings to God are not
[1:09:01] accepted unless they're done the right
[1:09:03] way
[1:09:03] yeah to be with me what does that mean
[1:09:06] I'm not trying to what I'm trying to do
[1:09:08] is try to help us to all look at our
[1:09:09] offerings of the more clearly are we
[1:09:11] offering oil line every day
[1:09:13] praise God neither are we just smiling
[1:09:15] are we rejoicing are we cried are we
[1:09:18] trying to give God or just our full love
[1:09:20] everyday oh we have to have oil line or
[1:09:23] you break the Word of God every see how
[1:09:26] important is to stay walk in the spirit
[1:09:28] and daily sacrifices and feasts of
[1:09:31] offerings and church services we need
[1:09:34] oil and wine amen
[1:09:36] the baptism with all the ghosts and the
[1:09:38] stimulation that comes behind it I don't
[1:09:41] know if you've at least once or twice
[1:09:42] every service some of the city lights we
[1:09:44] saw art I just give God glory as you
[1:09:47] you a booth or some like that because it
[1:09:49] feels like something rushed over beat
[1:09:50] maybe I didn't see in that like what is
[1:09:53] it it's God trying to strengthen the
[1:09:54] heart of man is God trying to make the
[1:09:57] heart happy for him and then it's God
[1:09:59] trying to show you his love church amen
[1:10:02] it's kind of trying to show me his love
[1:10:03] on the new you and I all those verses
[1:10:08] here you know from the concordance but
[1:10:11] um the sin offering and jealousy
[1:10:14] offering did not have oil and oil line
[1:10:16] of course we know because Christ was the
[1:10:18] sin offering right and the Holy Spirit
[1:10:20] had to lead him sometime you know by the
[1:10:23] Garden of Gethsemane in order for all
[1:10:25] this sin to put on him God couldn't put
[1:10:27] sin on the Holy Ghost they're two
[1:10:29] separate things right so the Holy Ghost
[1:10:31] had to leave Jesus at some point and Sid
[1:10:34] had to come upon him right that's like
[1:10:36] the sin offering sin offering could have
[1:10:38] no oil in life it just was a offering
[1:10:41] unto God
[1:10:42] remember oil was used in the burning of
[1:10:44] lamps praise God like the wise virgins
[1:10:47] how many want to be a life for Christ
[1:10:49] even as we said on Wednesday a star for
[1:10:52] Christ and on the moon either type each
[1:10:55] one has her own glory on it again you
[1:10:59] see and so we must have oil to burn
[1:11:02] brightly for Christ amen it's for used
[1:11:05] for medicinal purposes like in isaiah 1
[1:11:08] verse 6 and we'll get to Luke 10 in just
[1:11:10] a moment like this too is also used for
[1:11:14] anointing the day but the Holy Ghost on
[1:11:18] a dead thing and that's a good thing
[1:11:19] right
[1:11:20] it's a good thing to put the Holy Ghost
[1:11:22] on some dead you'll come to life amen
[1:11:24] just like that dead branch of errands
[1:11:27] right
[1:11:27] it wasn't living you put that dead thing
[1:11:29] in the spirit of god what happened it
[1:11:31] starts producing fruit but actually Lord
[1:11:34] who left my life belated the holiest of
[1:11:36] holy death and I can bring forth more
[1:11:39] fruit if it looks dead if this area let
[1:11:41] me say like this if I've been proved if
[1:11:45] I've been cut by the word and I don't
[1:11:46] see you through that area and I feel
[1:11:48] like it's dead but Lord place it in your
[1:11:50] presence that another branch can grow
[1:11:52] out and you could have fruit for your
[1:11:54] glory nay I could come out of my life
[1:11:56] because I mean oh it hurts to be proved
[1:11:58] and got a lot of things to happen in
[1:12:01] trials and situations and the way people
[1:12:03] treat you and the way things will happen
[1:12:06] Oh God will allow them to happen to
[1:12:08] prune you praise God but that only means
[1:12:11] more fruits coming later on amen and
[1:12:13] just gotta wait for the right season how
[1:12:15] many times I've seen that as a pastor
[1:12:16] you know well Graham said I'm not gonna
[1:12:19] go there I don't know who passed that by
[1:12:21] god I love the Lord amen oil was one of
[1:12:26] the most valuable products in the
[1:12:27] country according to deuteronomy 32:39
[1:12:30] she killed 16:13 it was a sign of
[1:12:35] gladness according to Psalms 92 10 and
[1:12:40] it's also when you were in sorrow you
[1:12:42] could have put oil on let's see it the
[1:12:45] opposite so when we're sorry
[1:12:47] don't get me wrong there's a godly
[1:12:49] sorrow at the balance that out remember
[1:12:51] 2nd Corinthians chapter 10 there's a
[1:12:53] godly sorrow which leads to repentance
[1:12:54] that could be a good thing but more than
[1:12:57] often the oil the Holy Ghost makes a
[1:12:59] person glad and makes them strong makes
[1:13:02] them joyful that's why God gives us the
[1:13:04] Holy Ghost I didn't have that before we
[1:13:07] can experience real joy we could
[1:13:08] experience real happiness
[1:13:10] so God give it to us so we can be a
[1:13:11] different race amen remember Christ was
[1:13:14] the firstborn among many brethren are
[1:13:16] you one of those many then he was the
[1:13:19] beginning of the new creation of God
[1:13:21] amen
[1:13:22] God's I'm going to start a new creation
[1:13:23] new Testament people that have high
[1:13:25] spirits sealed inside of them unto the
[1:13:28] day of redemption amen
[1:13:29] good happy milchester because our the
[1:13:31] flood of bulls and goats but now happens
[1:13:33] because God has a new race of people on
[1:13:35] there I'm glad to be one of those in
[1:13:37] that new race CNN the race that has
[1:13:39] audio and wide in the soul praise God
[1:13:42] now the Divya it's exactly ready that's
[1:13:48] why as we send some people's lives maybe
[1:13:50] are never accepted by God you've seen it
[1:13:52] people try to contact God try to give an
[1:13:54] offer and try to come to church for a
[1:13:56] while and they ultimately fall away
[1:13:58] because they're not accepted wife is
[1:14:00] they're not in the right condition they
[1:14:02] haven't brought online in other words
[1:14:04] they haven't died to themselves we've
[1:14:06] all seen just like a they offer the
[1:14:08] wrong thing
[1:14:09] said of offering their life as a
[1:14:11] sacrifice rooms up offering a
[1:14:13] sacrificial light they just try to give
[1:14:15] something else like money or time or
[1:14:17] church attendance or something like that
[1:14:19] or just make little sacrifices but the
[1:14:22] entire life has got to be given an
[1:14:24] unreal sacrifice happen today
[1:14:26] amen amen and God accepts that kind of
[1:14:28] sacrifice like I looked at mother in the
[1:14:31] face recently and he's told me well
[1:14:33] brother Jesse I do this I did this and
[1:14:35] he's claiming he's got the Holy Ghost I
[1:14:37] did have a heart to tell mother he
[1:14:39] wasn't one of my sheeps I didn't say
[1:14:40] anything about it
[1:14:41] but he looked at me said I believe I got
[1:14:44] the Holy Ghost and I still do this this
[1:14:46] this at least was some pretty awful
[1:14:48] things and I said sir I said the problem
[1:14:52] is you just haven't died out to those
[1:14:54] things because when you really die out
[1:14:56] those sins have no more pull apart amen
[1:14:59] I mean to get you to obey them you might
[1:15:02] be tempting the flesh but you're dead to
[1:15:04] them and they'll never rise again 89 is
[1:15:08] that right and Church the man started me
[1:15:11] for about five seconds and change the
[1:15:12] subject
[1:15:13] and what was it to me that's a
[1:15:15] vindication they know better they know
[1:15:17] they haven't prayed until they've got
[1:15:19] breaking through church and I don't care
[1:15:21] where it happens I don't care if it
[1:15:22] happens here or at your home or if you
[1:15:24] need to break through you got to pray
[1:15:26] until you die out and that God's will be
[1:15:28] done in your life I don't care where it
[1:15:30] happens it's nice to see it happen here
[1:15:32] but it don't have to it can happen
[1:15:34] anywhere amen
[1:15:35] and God just wants to see us broken
[1:15:37] remember that scripture where Jesus said
[1:15:39] either you will fall on the rock and be
[1:15:42] broken or the rock will fall on you
[1:15:44] remember that anybody remember that no
[1:15:47] okay let's let me look it up that's
[1:15:51] that's what's happened in church we've
[1:15:52] got to throw ourselves upon Christ and
[1:15:55] that's what you do when you die to
[1:15:56] yourself you throw yourself Allah I'm
[1:15:59] selling out lock stock and barrel
[1:16:01] Lord take all of me you throw yourself
[1:16:03] upon Christ and you're broken and then
[1:16:05] you can put the pieces back in handy but
[1:16:09] if not if we don't sacrifice ourselves
[1:16:11] and fully sell out then Christ is going
[1:16:13] to come and smash-ups
[1:16:14] is not like the image you never can
[1:16:16] answer amen right he has to come and
[1:16:18] smash that but we need to recognize they
[1:16:20] wanna throw myself on your mercy
[1:16:22] I'm throwing myself at the feet of Jesus
[1:16:24] and say hey and it helped break those
[1:16:26] chains and break those bonds and I'll
[1:16:28] make you a new creature in Christ Jesus
[1:16:30] amen
[1:16:31] let me find if anybody finds it first
[1:16:34] let me know I think it's broken
[1:16:41] I'm going to look at the New Testament
[1:16:44] yep Matthew 21 let's go Matthew 21 don't
[1:16:48] you love your dances this fella today I
[1:16:51] have a big fat huge concordance up here
[1:16:53] flipping Panda
[1:16:54] give me second church he did that
[1:16:56] there's numerous eyes I've heard in
[1:16:58] church amen let me look through this
[1:16:59] when we find that scripture he asks the
[1:17:02] brothers who looked on the good carden's
[1:17:04] Matthew 21:43 now look he's talking to
[1:17:10] the Israel I am going to take the
[1:17:12] kingdom away from you in other words
[1:17:13] you're going to reject the baptism all
[1:17:14] the ghosts I'm gonna give it to somebody
[1:17:15] else so this scripture ties him
[1:17:18] perfectly with the baptism of the Holy
[1:17:20] Ghost this is taken from the Jews and
[1:17:22] given to the Gentiles verse 43
[1:17:24] therefore I say unto you the kingdom of
[1:17:26] God shall be taken from you
[1:17:28] what's the kingdom of God Jesus said it
[1:17:30] comes out with observation he says the
[1:17:31] kingdom of God is within you and given
[1:17:35] to a nation bringing forth the fruits
[1:17:37] thereof alright see you next verse verse
[1:17:41] 44 the sober timeline and whosoever
[1:17:44] shall fall on this stone shall be broken
[1:17:46] put on loose rubber shall fall it will
[1:17:49] grind him to powder look what'd he say
[1:17:52] I don't want Christ to fall on me and
[1:17:55] riding me up
[1:17:56] I want to freely give myself to Christ
[1:17:58] I'm gonna say little Jesse that's what I
[1:18:00] want to I wanted it broken on Christ
[1:18:02] absolutely one of the other remember I
[1:18:05] preached a sermon here's about if
[1:18:06] anybody remembers it beau might they
[1:18:08] might I call it a broken worship or
[1:18:12] broken individuals I thought something
[1:18:14] like that because either one you're
[1:18:17] going to be either have one of the other
[1:18:18] either your worship is broken at you're
[1:18:20] dead stiff and starchy and full of pride
[1:18:22] and lust or you're the one who's broken
[1:18:24] ain't a head you're broke you have no
[1:18:27] will of your own you just want the with
[1:18:29] a guy and then
[1:18:31] your will is broken Christ is broken
[1:18:34] your will and it's not what
[1:18:36] once anymore it's not what brother Adam
[1:18:38] once it brother item it's not what I
[1:18:40] want anymore
[1:18:40] my most broken Christ's can have his way
[1:18:43] in me and then a teammate amen
[1:18:45] praise God that's description I hope you
[1:18:47] enjoyed that by God's grace that's a man
[1:18:49] the kingdom of God that's a Holy Ghost
[1:18:51] baptism Scripture because the kingdom of
[1:18:54] God is the Holy Ghost all right I hope
[1:18:58] that's a help by God's grace now for why
[1:19:00] accordions Baba dictionary
[1:19:03] it starts off I say our Lord
[1:19:04] miraculously supplied wine at the
[1:19:07] marriage feasts is now what Jesus does
[1:19:09] he turns the water of the word into why
[1:19:12] amen and that's his first miracle and it
[1:19:16] took place at a wedding
[1:19:17] praise God right he takes the word and
[1:19:19] he makes it into wine and just stimulate
[1:19:22] you praise God amen because we're washed
[1:19:25] by the water of the word amen
[1:19:28] that's exactly right Christ always does
[1:19:31] that Christ always will supply he'll
[1:19:33] turn though every day service every day
[1:19:35] water they'll turn your every day Bible
[1:19:37] reading into why Amen to stimulate you
[1:19:40] they meant to let you know that it's
[1:19:42] wedding time
[1:19:43] amen other than its ladies eye and this
[1:19:46] is needed for the wedding reception I do
[1:19:50] thank you Jesus now in Bible days
[1:19:53] natural wine when it was drunk even by
[1:19:56] Jesus this says water was always mixed
[1:19:59] with it and it was a custom in the days
[1:20:02] of Christ the people indeed are
[1:20:05] everywhere very sober in hot climates
[1:20:07] that's why the why he was super watered
[1:20:10] down in the days of Jesus because if
[1:20:12] you're drinking a lot of alcohol and
[1:20:13] it's hot
[1:20:14] you're losing water real fast and you're
[1:20:17] going to die you're going to die of some
[1:20:19] type of a problem pretty soon in fact a
[1:20:22] drunken person is rarely seen the sin of
[1:20:25] drunkenness however must feet must have
[1:20:27] not been uncommon to olden times for its
[1:20:29] mentioned either metaphoric here
[1:20:31] literally more than seventy times in the
[1:20:33] Bible yet they would still do it because
[1:20:35] they were addicted to the effects of
[1:20:37] alcohol all right now it goes in to say
[1:20:44] the drink offering was present the daily
[1:20:47] sacrifice right and also the offering of
[1:20:49] the first
[1:20:50] ah there's a good one so see you even
[1:20:54] got to have a holy ghost to pay your
[1:20:55] tithes and offerings the right way okay
[1:20:57] right because there's a lot about racial
[1:21:00] people that pay them right but they're
[1:21:01] not paying it the right way they're paid
[1:21:04] it to the preacher rather than paying to
[1:21:05] God are you with me on that
[1:21:08] so you got even have the Holy Spirit
[1:21:09] mixed in your first fruit offerings see
[1:21:13] because it takes the Holy Spirit to do
[1:21:14] it it really does remember brother
[1:21:17] Mannis with ties and offerings are
[1:21:18] eternal he said eternal that means I
[1:21:21] never have an ending I mean God will
[1:21:23] remember those all the offerings that
[1:21:25] you gave back all the ties you getting
[1:21:26] back I'll keep a record of it
[1:21:28] that's exactly right now it says this
[1:21:33] line was used at the celebration of the
[1:21:35] Passover hi when the Lord's Supper was
[1:21:39] instituted the wine and unleavened bread
[1:21:40] then on the Paschal table were by our
[1:21:42] Lord set apart as memorials of his body
[1:21:45] and blood
[1:21:46] praise God amen now let's uh let me read
[1:21:50] a quote now I'll get a few more
[1:21:52] scriptures I'm just just going to try to
[1:21:53] preach an hour like I said I feel good
[1:21:55] but now I'm feeling okay by God's grace
[1:21:57] thank God for His mercy so let me go to
[1:22:00] the fourth seal now brother Graham
[1:22:02] preaches it in the third seal but just a
[1:22:03] short little section he spends more time
[1:22:05] reviewing it in the fourth seal the next
[1:22:07] night if you haven't listened that or
[1:22:09] read that recently now but man said but
[1:22:15] Satan was forbidden to touch the oil
[1:22:17] wine which was a little that was left
[1:22:21] but Graham said we touched him he said
[1:22:23] it might have sounded a little rude but
[1:22:25] is just exactly the truth he said let's
[1:22:29] renew review that now we left off on the
[1:22:32] power of the line what the oil
[1:22:33] represented the spirit he said and where
[1:22:36] to find the scriptures the oil and with
[1:22:37] oils always symbolizes the Holy Spirit
[1:22:41] he talks about the foolish virgins and
[1:22:43] so forth I'm going to skip ahead and
[1:22:47] said now oil symbolize always fair
[1:22:49] always connected and worship and wide
[1:22:51] symbolizes that is the power of
[1:22:53] stimulation by revelation and that's
[1:22:55] when something has been revealed
[1:22:57] it gives stimulation to the believer
[1:22:59] because it's presented by revelation
[1:23:02] it's something
[1:23:03] that God has said it's a mystery they
[1:23:07] can't understand it see but after a
[1:23:08] while God comes down and reveals it and
[1:23:11] then vindicates it like that amen
[1:23:15] so stimulation happens when you have a
[1:23:16] mystery in your life or a mystery about
[1:23:19] the Bible and God comes and answers your
[1:23:21] mystery amen he solves your mystery
[1:23:24] dissolves all your doubts now you ought
[1:23:26] to be stimulated by that amen
[1:23:27] God knows the desires of your heart amen
[1:23:33] praise the Lord I talks about Moses how
[1:23:36] God came in backed up what Moses said
[1:23:38] that's what I was using that God backs
[1:23:40] up what we say as the stimulation that
[1:23:43] he's actually speaking he gives a few
[1:23:45] more examples I want to just real quick
[1:23:47] here
[1:23:48] he said now the power of revelation
[1:23:51] brings stimulation to the believer for
[1:23:53] the power of natural wine is to
[1:23:55] stimulated it'll bring a person that's
[1:23:58] all slumped down to a stimulation well
[1:24:02] then now there is a power of Revelation
[1:24:05] the word give stimulation of joy to the
[1:24:07] believer stimulation of satisfaction the
[1:24:10] stimulation that is vindicated it's
[1:24:13] proven now I was a sinner and I saw
[1:24:15] numerous people when they were not
[1:24:17] drinking they were very shy individuals
[1:24:19] but once they would start drinking they
[1:24:21] were the life of the party you have to
[1:24:24] raise your hand I seen it numerous times
[1:24:27] some of the guys I would never say
[1:24:28] anything at school we go to the party
[1:24:31] and then they just start mouthing off at
[1:24:33] everybody I think what got into that guy
[1:24:35] well why I got in that guy alcohol guy
[1:24:37] to that guy
[1:24:38] and burn Ram said that's what it is for
[1:24:40] a Christian he said when you're all
[1:24:42] slumped over so if you see the
[1:24:44] illustration slumped over or depressed
[1:24:46] or discouraged the Holy Spirit comes as
[1:24:49] wide to make you straighten your
[1:24:51] shoulders and stand strong as a believer
[1:24:53] Amen if you weren't testified about
[1:24:55] God's Word now you are in amen
[1:24:58] that's what it's for you're the life of
[1:25:01] your job you're the life of your home
[1:25:03] not because it's not a party right it's
[1:25:05] a job but you're the life of the group
[1:25:08] because the Holy Spirit is in you amen
[1:25:11] and you're solving problems right you're
[1:25:13] thinking you're letting God's will be
[1:25:16] done
[1:25:16] oh my the will of God the revelation of
[1:25:18] God's Word is in your heart but all you
[1:25:20] think about is God your stimulated amen
[1:25:23] it's exactly right well Graham said no
[1:25:27] no Bible he said in the scripture
[1:25:29] it's called knew why they were drunk on
[1:25:31] new wide or spiritual wine he says sorry
[1:25:36] and then he says Jesus he quotes Jesus
[1:25:39] in John 6 it is the spirit that
[1:25:41] quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing
[1:25:43] the words and I speak unto you they are
[1:25:45] spirit and they are life amen
[1:25:49] but remember the word itself is spirit
[1:25:51] it is spirit in Word form let me know
[1:25:54] that the Holy Spirit is this is a word
[1:25:56] and spirit form praise God this is the
[1:26:00] word right this is the word but the Holy
[1:26:02] Spirit is this word in action that's my
[1:26:06] brother madam said the Holy Ghost will
[1:26:07] only point you to the word I mean that's
[1:26:10] one of the people tell me they got the
[1:26:11] Holy Ghost and they move outside the
[1:26:13] word I say you're back Synod writer
[1:26:16] you're disobedient or you don't have
[1:26:18] what you claim to have because the only
[1:26:20] ghost only points you to the Word of God
[1:26:21] I know we have to prepend alien that you
[1:26:24] a backside to Haley and things like that
[1:26:26] I'm talking over all your overall life
[1:26:28] the seasons can I say that the seasons
[1:26:31] of your life you go through seasons we
[1:26:33] get you're still dedicated to God you're
[1:26:35] still evading the Word of God
[1:26:37] you're still a beating to what the word
[1:26:38] says the Holy Spirit is the word in
[1:26:42] spirit for me says that's right now it
[1:26:46] goes on he says it stimulates and it
[1:26:48] gives joy because it's God's Word
[1:26:51] now how many would be honest to say real
[1:26:53] justice that joy straight but it don't
[1:26:55] last as long as I should let honey be
[1:26:57] honest you don't raise your hand it
[1:27:00] happens to me I've told you before I'm
[1:27:02] so stimulated sometimes if I walk out of
[1:27:04] service and then something bad will
[1:27:05] happen the man now the child might say
[1:27:07] something or child will spill something
[1:27:09] I've got to be careful to keep that joy
[1:27:11] going right but we've all experienced it
[1:27:15] where we're joyful going out but by the
[1:27:18] time we get to the car something
[1:27:19] happened someone stepped on our
[1:27:21] spiritual toe
[1:27:23] or so obvious we just forgot see how
[1:27:26] easy this is sniffing it opposite in and
[1:27:28] out of this that's why we got to just
[1:27:30] keep drinking it praise God he does keep
[1:27:32] the word upon our heart amen he he keep
[1:27:36] the bottle of the word close Kos Amen
[1:27:38] you seen those guys that the parties
[1:27:40] that have they have to help us to have
[1:27:42] the beer cans attached to them or they
[1:27:45] got the belt well that's what we are
[1:27:47] with the Word of God
[1:27:48] that's a mockery but in other words we
[1:27:50] always have the Word of God ready to
[1:27:52] talk about and you don't know if you
[1:27:54] have to have it on your cell phonee up
[1:27:55] there you have to pack the Bible but
[1:27:57] when you're ready you can't wait to
[1:27:59] witness or you can't wait to sing a song
[1:28:01] then you're like one of those guys or
[1:28:02] one of those girls or whatever you are
[1:28:04] you just live on the Word of God and see
[1:28:08] you want to pack it that's how I'm going
[1:28:09] to be on a packet everywhere I've built
[1:28:10] so many times this week I was ready at
[1:28:12] my family's vacation to just talk about
[1:28:14] the Prophet I got like two or three
[1:28:15] opportunities so I said hey he's the
[1:28:17] Lord for that right here I'm just I'm
[1:28:18] just pumped primed and ready to go
[1:28:21] just ask me about it just ask me about
[1:28:22] it and they finally did I got to talk
[1:28:24] about a little bit by God's grace ah but
[1:28:29] see that's what we pray for that's what
[1:28:31] we live for
[1:28:32] we packed the Word of God that we might
[1:28:34] be a vessel to share to somebody else
[1:28:36] praise God
[1:28:37] my man who said see he says then then
[1:28:40] the slide brings joy beyond measure
[1:28:42] sometimes we went through that that
[1:28:45] brings such a joy to you get over
[1:28:47] flooded the last time I got over flooded
[1:28:50] and danced was after I preached that
[1:28:52] message in December Lloris my number
[1:28:55] because there was even his microphone
[1:28:56] was left in the sanctuary on the key to
[1:28:59] the door never a service key to the door
[1:29:00] in December I was so happy off of that I
[1:29:03] just started running in front of it I
[1:29:04] just I couldn't I was losing my energy
[1:29:06] so I just felt out on the pulpit so I'm
[1:29:08] training this altar I would pray to
[1:29:10] giving God glory I'm so over flooded I
[1:29:13] got to do something with that don't you
[1:29:14] enjoy the overflowing than I hate
[1:29:16] reading it might be tears for you it
[1:29:18] might be a screen for you I don't know
[1:29:20] what it is for you but that's what
[1:29:21] happens when you get so overflow with
[1:29:23] the line of Christ
[1:29:24] you got to express yourself in some way
[1:29:26] in the end a man he said you get over
[1:29:29] flooded and then we're going to gain the
[1:29:31] example of David saying my cup runneth
[1:29:33] over
[1:29:34] are you it runs over amen
[1:29:38] as I said on Wednesday Church I'm going
[1:29:40] to revisit that just for a moment if we
[1:29:43] go to church and we're getting nothing
[1:29:46] out of it we've got to check up on
[1:29:47] ourselves yes the preacher needs to
[1:29:52] check up on himself
[1:29:54] but if I'm preaching the word brother
[1:29:56] Graham said that that man is anointed of
[1:29:58] God if I'm preaching the word let me
[1:30:01] this is example I thought of if I preach
[1:30:04] acts 2:38 here this morning and you
[1:30:08] already know you got you know baptized
[1:30:10] the right way then the Holy Spirit in
[1:30:14] you ought to be able to say amen to that
[1:30:16] and then think of those who haven't been
[1:30:18] baptized in acts through 2:38 and your
[1:30:21] eternal life living for somebody else
[1:30:23] ought to pull upon that word so God deal
[1:30:26] with that individual deal with that
[1:30:28] fight of your own so they'll get
[1:30:29] baptized that's if you got eternal life
[1:30:32] how many how many guys are alive that's
[1:30:35] what should happen at the preaching of
[1:30:36] the word right here's my man said if the
[1:30:39] Apostles had any treaty what was it
[1:30:41] acts 2:38 write the book of James the
[1:30:47] New Testament was even written till
[1:30:48] 80/60 so they preached from 33 AD to
[1:30:53] 6080 without one written word they just
[1:30:56] preached by the Holy Spirit I'm entitled
[1:30:58] ABC and they couldn't say acts 2:38 as
[1:31:01] it wasn't written yet they didn't say
[1:31:03] Peter said at the Creed of the Apostles
[1:31:05] the eternal prescription repent be
[1:31:07] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:31:09] Jesus coming hey and as I gave the
[1:31:12] example of Wednesday I don't care if you
[1:31:14] have steak every Friday night or pizza
[1:31:17] every Thursday night if you're hungry
[1:31:19] you can't wait to eat it and the church
[1:31:21] said Amen if you're thirsty you don't
[1:31:23] care if it's water
[1:31:24] well you might or milk or Gatorade when
[1:31:28] you're really thirsty you'll take
[1:31:30] whatever is calling that you don't take
[1:31:33] anything and that's why we got to check
[1:31:36] ourselves when we come to the house of
[1:31:38] God praise the Lord hey man it's a
[1:31:41] feeding time it's supper and it proves
[1:31:43] that people aren't pulling on the Word
[1:31:44] of God if the words wrong that's my
[1:31:47] fault but if the words
[1:31:48] right then you're to spend too much time
[1:31:50] feeding on other things and you're not
[1:31:51] hungry
[1:31:52] right that's nothing but the truth amen
[1:31:55] praise the Lord
[1:31:57] I'm Cameron's acts 2:38 or what okay
[1:32:00] what it is we're revelations then seven
[1:32:02] how can we not be hungry and excited
[1:32:05] about the Word of God when there's
[1:32:07] people that need that might need that
[1:32:09] word on it we can all say that search we
[1:32:12] can all say this by God's honesty we've
[1:32:14] all thought people have had the Holy
[1:32:16] Ghost and all they don't need acts 2:38
[1:32:19] and they fell away into sin and approve
[1:32:21] they never even repented in the
[1:32:23] beginning and we wanted to run to the
[1:32:25] Holy Spirit keep preaching on it why
[1:32:26] delicious Ricky preached on church
[1:32:27] attendance and worship and come in too
[1:32:29] early to pray why is the Holy Spirit
[1:32:31] what is it
[1:32:32] why does God like the pastor to keep
[1:32:33] preaching on those thickness you see
[1:32:35] that because there's actual real needs
[1:32:39] there and none of us can know all we can
[1:32:41] do is obey the Word of God and make our
[1:32:43] calling an election Shin and that's why
[1:32:46] we don't shut up that's why don't push
[1:32:48] away the broccoli and pizza in front
[1:32:50] Friday night Tuesday pizza not at all
[1:32:51] that's why I get excited every time for
[1:32:54] pizza 9 mana right or so they go to
[1:32:56] Jamie go I decide I'd sue she every
[1:32:59] Sunday
[1:32:59] but every Sunday I get excited for more
[1:33:01] sushi and why because I'm hungry for it
[1:33:03] I developed a taste for you and I want
[1:33:06] to develop a taste for the light of God
[1:33:08] amen the oil Holy Spirit amen
[1:33:11] see we can't let it get old well if you
[1:33:14] let a mac and cheese get old and hungry
[1:33:16] for mac and cheese if you let mashed
[1:33:19] potatoes get old your exact on adventure
[1:33:21] doc can you hungry your mashed potatoes
[1:33:22] are served so see we have to live for
[1:33:26] others praise God we have to have to
[1:33:30] live for others and learn to pull upon
[1:33:32] the Word of God and that's why we share
[1:33:36] with the churches well I want the church
[1:33:37] to learn my dad said if we can't learn
[1:33:38] he said we're mules I don't want to be a
[1:33:41] mule Church I don't want to wait till my
[1:33:43] last breath to kick somebody up dead
[1:33:44] before I go God takes him out there I
[1:33:46] guess that's what I'm you will do he
[1:33:48] said oh wait so it's dying day to kick
[1:33:49] the farmer and back he said because you
[1:33:53] can't teach him anything he just wants
[1:33:55] to get upset with people's I want to be
[1:33:57] a thoroughbred I want to be someone
[1:33:59] that's got papers the Bible papers I
[1:34:01] know where I come from
[1:34:02] I know where I'm going I know what I am
[1:34:04] and you can teach me something I'll be
[1:34:06] obedient David and then I responded to
[1:34:08] God's leadership and I'll be able to
[1:34:10] learn something and I'll be able to
[1:34:12] share with somebody else
[1:34:15] that's my that's my desire for the
[1:34:17] church Lord winning tonight I want to do
[1:34:18] a little bit more that just no slower
[1:34:20] can we learn to come to church early and
[1:34:23] pray can we learn to keep pulling on the
[1:34:24] word even if it's something we heard
[1:34:26] already because I know any of you that
[1:34:28] push away something you've already eaten
[1:34:29] already
[1:34:30] well I already had broccoli last year
[1:34:32] I'm not gonna have any problem well I
[1:34:34] really like why they were like
[1:34:35] hamburgers but I already had a hamburger
[1:34:37] give me something new what kind of what
[1:34:41] kind of pressure would be on the on the
[1:34:43] cook you kind of create something brand
[1:34:45] new every single meal bread and don't
[1:34:47] use anything old use everything brand
[1:34:50] new what kind of pressure would use like
[1:34:53] that sisters I don't think my wife would
[1:34:56] like that I already had this last year
[1:34:58] don't bring we ate this last week we
[1:34:59] have potatoes last week I never want
[1:35:01] another potato
[1:35:02] don't throw that to me god help us to
[1:35:04] have the right attitude I say fun to
[1:35:05] that help us to have the right attitude
[1:35:08] because that's the only way the Holy
[1:35:09] Ghost is by holding and create the
[1:35:11] atmosphere upon them upon the Word of
[1:35:13] God no matter what's being preached the
[1:35:15] program said if it's the truth to agree
[1:35:17] with it Damon say Amen to it
[1:35:19] amen brother amen but may have said oh
[1:35:24] there's a lot of fanaticism people
[1:35:25] carrying on and we don't have a lot of
[1:35:26] that here
[1:35:27] which is a good thing you don't want
[1:35:29] fanaticism you want the reality and I
[1:35:31] just listened to what your style Elijah
[1:35:32] from 1959's listen that yesterday and
[1:35:35] brother Graham goes to the other side of
[1:35:37] emotion he said some of the greatest
[1:35:39] things are the most quiet things he
[1:35:42] talked about the planets rotating do you
[1:35:44] know the earth spins at over 100,000
[1:35:46] miles problem program said did you ever
[1:35:49] hear it did ever hear the moon spin no a
[1:35:53] hundred thousand miles per hour not sure
[1:35:56] that's it's moving around the earth I'm
[1:35:58] sorry the earth itself spins at 6,000 he
[1:36:00] was 6,000 miles per hours 600 something
[1:36:02] something like that I've got my numbers
[1:36:03] mixed up but it has two speeds you know
[1:36:05] around the Sun and it also does own
[1:36:07] rotation
[1:36:08] I think it's 600 miles per hour spinning
[1:36:10] the earth is spinning itself around its
[1:36:12] axis and so see we got to do the mail
[1:36:16] don't look for a motion to start but he
[1:36:18] said wait till God reveals something he
[1:36:20] said then let your such a cup overflow
[1:36:22] that and his mocha I said watch he said
[1:36:25] watch how quiet it gets in the
[1:36:27] discernment line he said that's what
[1:36:28] should happen and then God would reveal
[1:36:30] something he said that it's time to
[1:36:32] rejoice at umass hallelujah I hope that
[1:36:36] help that's understood by God's grace
[1:36:38] but Ram said Agra this before I want to
[1:36:41] read again I've seen people in the day
[1:36:43] when as long as the music is playing
[1:36:45] everybody was jumping in screaming when
[1:36:47] the music stopped has stopped well
[1:36:49] that's still alright as far as I'm
[1:36:50] concerned you see as long as people
[1:36:52] lives right last year I went to a church
[1:36:56] with Steve al Jim you've ever seen
[1:36:57] Alexander he took me the single guy
[1:37:00] who's real skinny you know kind of tends
[1:37:02] to be homeless remember him he said I
[1:37:05] want to take you to this Apostolic
[1:37:06] Church so what happens on church that's
[1:37:08] exactly what it was they took turns
[1:37:10] running around the church during song
[1:37:12] service they got their half hour early
[1:37:14] and all the preachers walked up and
[1:37:15] forth like this praying out loud you
[1:37:17] know tapping people on the shoulders all
[1:37:19] the preachers rub on the go like this
[1:37:21] and all the people out there you know
[1:37:23] waving their hands for half an hour
[1:37:24] before service and then during the songs
[1:37:26] they take turns running Simon's mouth
[1:37:29] comes here right now got sprinting
[1:37:31] around the church one boy we go then
[1:37:33] another then when the boys got done the
[1:37:35] girls would go over that but as soon as
[1:37:39] the music stopped - it's a seat
[1:37:44] that might mean you're just kind of
[1:37:46] putting it on praise God
[1:37:50] now look what he says next but when you
[1:37:52] start bringing that word that's the
[1:37:54] thing that actually brings light that
[1:37:57] brings the joy of stimulation of new
[1:37:59] wine and that's what it was on Pentecost
[1:38:01] was the word vindicated amen that's what
[1:38:05] I wanted to see church that's not don't
[1:38:06] want to see that here we see the special
[1:38:08] meetings you see it sometimes here but
[1:38:10] don't try to see more of it as a pass
[1:38:13] that's my greatest desire to see Mormon
[1:38:15] that the word actually brings more
[1:38:16] emotion than even the Psalms although
[1:38:18] that's good it's good it's good to
[1:38:20] worship during the song but the word
[1:38:21] that actually brings like life-changing
[1:38:24] revelation will actually bring the most
[1:38:26] noise and the most rejoicing and
[1:38:27] Oh stimulation just the preaching of the
[1:38:29] word Amen alright I see this Amen I 2
[1:38:33] times I preach I had to stop preaching
[1:38:35] because of all the work she's going on I
[1:38:37] really appreciate that I was there for
[1:38:39] the cans I can other one wasn't going on
[1:38:41] yeah other ones though I just could
[1:38:44] never saw that I was preached on Elijah
[1:38:47] I was preached on Elijah how he went up
[1:38:49] to heaven a garment fell down and he
[1:38:52] said where's the god of Elijah not
[1:38:54] saying where's the god of william
[1:38:55] branham and the people were just really
[1:38:57] and they just kept clapping and shouting
[1:39:00] standing up a praising God sighs let's
[1:39:01] quit I can't preach anymore I already
[1:39:05] preached about omens that's why but see
[1:39:07] that's the atmosphere I'm not saying
[1:39:09] every service has to be like that I'm
[1:39:11] just saying that's what brings life is
[1:39:13] the word the Word of God revealed to you
[1:39:16] and I that should bring us more
[1:39:17] stimulation anything else but if you get
[1:39:20] overflowed during the song service and
[1:39:22] be like me run across here all flat down
[1:39:24] on the altar just worship the Lord do
[1:39:26] whatever you do for the kingdom of God
[1:39:28] that's right now the last examples are
[1:39:32] David he said David cup runneth over and
[1:39:34] he said when David danced around the ark
[1:39:36] he said that was his cup overflowing he
[1:39:40] said anyone was actually the right
[1:39:41] example because it was he was dancing
[1:39:43] because the word was returning the word
[1:39:46] was being restored to its rightful
[1:39:47] position and that's what happened to us
[1:39:49] the work it to the rightful position
[1:39:51] we'll have to rejoice amen
[1:39:53] I've had so many Oh since my children
[1:39:55] I've been baptized three my own children
[1:39:57] you can believe I was spiritually
[1:39:59] praying and crying and rejoice it what
[1:40:01] that happened I was a dancer but I was
[1:40:04] crying to weep and embrace it God when
[1:40:07] the word comes to your house you save
[1:40:09] into that when the word comes back to
[1:40:12] its position in your life you'll give
[1:40:14] God glory amen
[1:40:15] what's going to hold it back you can't
[1:40:17] get old your emotion because that
[1:40:18] happens with mine and all amen
[1:40:20] it's stimulate you praise God okay let
[1:40:24] me try to move on here and I just want
[1:40:31] to say this as I preach this I don't
[1:40:33] forget to say this brother Brandon you
[1:40:35] know when you went behind the curtain
[1:40:37] time he said they said they're going to
[1:40:41] judge for administering what he says I
[1:40:42] preach football preached where Paul
[1:40:44] baptized in Jesus Christ's name
[1:40:46] i baptize he said where Paul preached
[1:40:49] the Holy Ghost I Priscilla lead let me
[1:40:52] say for me by God's grace I appreciate
[1:40:55] to go to the same way brother Brendan
[1:40:57] amen
[1:40:58] why didn't I we are the most impressive
[1:41:00] preachers preach the that the water
[1:41:02] baptism the same when I was good that's
[1:41:04] a wonderful start but we want to preach
[1:41:06] the Holy Ghost baptism the same way as
[1:41:08] well even its wine and oil you first
[1:41:11] receive the oil and that brings
[1:41:12] stimulation of wine to your life say hey
[1:41:14] it's exactly right I just want to lay
[1:41:17] that in there so important we've got to
[1:41:19] preach it the exact same way to praise
[1:41:21] God let me do a two more let me do I got
[1:41:26] three more here I've already gone two
[1:41:29] hours so I don't to go to much longer
[1:41:30] and my watch the ropes I have a watch
[1:41:32] let me set the timer here not even here
[1:41:34] old and the thing broke already
[1:41:36] I know what you enjoy people are saying
[1:41:38] I know what you say in the UH mid 15
[1:41:43] minutes here by God's grace let's go and
[1:41:49] look back to Luke five with a five owner
[1:41:51] reprogram set out this Luke chapter 5 to
[1:41:56] 5
[1:41:57] read this earlier about the new wine and
[1:41:59] bottles now whether I preach this
[1:42:02] thought I'm going to read in Lima Ohio
[1:42:04] praise Lord which is where I started
[1:42:06] serving the Lord in the message none
[1:42:08] message now Jesus says verse 37 no man
[1:42:15] putteth new wine into old bottles else
[1:42:17] the new wine will burst the bottles and
[1:42:19] be spilled and the bottles will perish
[1:42:21] and new but new ye must be put into new
[1:42:24] bottles and both are preserved
[1:42:26] no man also having drunk old wines
[1:42:29] straightway desired new for he saith the
[1:42:31] oldest better oh my what a tight there
[1:42:34] let me read rip up Graham said here he
[1:42:36] said this great revival we're speaking
[1:42:38] of us has to come from heaven it can't
[1:42:41] come from man it wasn't boredom and it
[1:42:45] was bored of God has to come from God
[1:42:47] you can't put this revival an old
[1:42:49] theology and mix it up jesus said that
[1:42:51] st. Luke you can't put new wine in old
[1:42:54] bottles
[1:42:55] I often wonder why that statement was
[1:42:58] made while you can't put new wine in old
[1:43:00] bottles I come to find out he said we
[1:43:03] use a glass jug a bottle why couldn't I
[1:43:07] put a new line of those things but I
[1:43:09] found out back in the days when Jesus
[1:43:11] was speaking up the bottles wasn't made
[1:43:13] of glass they didn't have the
[1:43:15] glassblowers in those days they was made
[1:43:18] out of animal skin and the animals could
[1:43:20] have been tannin soda or tied up and
[1:43:22] they put the new wine the liquids in a
[1:43:25] skin bottle and after that the bottle
[1:43:27] becomes so old no why did or anything it
[1:43:30] dried out the animal oil of the skin
[1:43:33] left and then it got hard and stiff so
[1:43:37] that is that never ever to remember that
[1:43:39] by God's grace their bottles were
[1:43:41] actually animal skins so you couldn't
[1:43:44] put new wine that had potential to grow
[1:43:47] in a bold skin praise the Lord a man a
[1:43:50] man who said I see what Jesus meant if
[1:43:52] you put new wine unfermented wine into a
[1:43:55] bottle like that and the new wine at
[1:43:56] life in it it went to working and
[1:43:59] fermenting it would burst the bottle
[1:44:01] that's the way you take the baptism of
[1:44:04] the Holy Ghost and put it in an old dry
[1:44:06] formal cowhide it'll blow up as sure as
[1:44:11] the world you just can't have it like
[1:44:13] that you try to take the back to the
[1:44:16] Holy Ghost with the old experience of
[1:44:18] something long drawn-out church
[1:44:19] experience it'll blow up sure is the
[1:44:21] world but new wine said Jesus goes in
[1:44:24] new bottles the new bottles has still
[1:44:28] the animal oil in the skins and it's
[1:44:30] flexible that's the way God's church
[1:44:32] must be for animal flexible amen now for
[1:44:36] us what does that mean we got to be
[1:44:38] flexible to bend a little bit to bend
[1:44:42] our actions a little bit every see what
[1:44:44] I'm talking about
[1:44:44] if you want revival we got to change our
[1:44:47] behavior man we can't do the same thing
[1:44:51] over and over and over again how many
[1:44:54] want to be able to bend to the Holy
[1:44:55] Spirit
[1:44:56] that means change your position to
[1:44:57] something different right if you want
[1:45:01] revival you've got to be flexible you
[1:45:03] got to be able to say okay why don't do
[1:45:06] this very often but I'm gonna try this
[1:45:08] probably God's leading me to do this
[1:45:10] amen that's right how do I be flexible
[1:45:14] og man praise not and we got to be
[1:45:18] willing to do things we normally don't
[1:45:20] do go BAM so you know you can put the
[1:45:24] new one which represents the word put
[1:45:26] the new one in a whole bottle and you'll
[1:45:28] read the word and it says Jesus Christ
[1:45:30] the same yesterday today and forever the
[1:45:31] old bottle will go poof
[1:45:33] he says blows up I don't believe it the
[1:45:36] baptism Holy Ghost is just as real today
[1:45:38] that roseboom I don't believe it
[1:45:39] and what do you do you spoil both
[1:45:41] bottles and wine a church we don't have
[1:45:45] to say nonsense to deny the work of the
[1:45:49] Holy Spirit we just have to sit still
[1:45:51] and not act upon the Word of God how
[1:45:54] many understand that understand that but
[1:45:57] the bantam said a preacher can preach
[1:45:59] all night until he's sore the lungs but
[1:46:02] until the people make a move it won't do
[1:46:04] anything he said you can pour a gallon
[1:46:07] of oil on them all night the people have
[1:46:09] to move another in other words people
[1:46:11] have to follow the leadership of the
[1:46:12] Holy Spirit includes me exudes all of us
[1:46:15] that makes sense no one ever this church
[1:46:19] I've never seen anyone say no I don't
[1:46:21] want the Holy Ghost they never said that
[1:46:24] oh no I don't believe in I don't believe
[1:46:27] it's okay to show I've never seen
[1:46:28] anybody do that well I don't believe in
[1:46:31] speaking in tongues I've never seen
[1:46:32] anybody do that but people with their
[1:46:34] actions and their attitudes if they
[1:46:37] don't like the worship they that they're
[1:46:40] actually doing that even though they're
[1:46:41] not saying it to understand that in
[1:46:45] Trinidad the first time ago or time I
[1:46:46] preached there I had preached loud I
[1:46:48] preached excited and I preached up the
[1:46:50] Holy Ghost and the pastor's wife went
[1:46:52] home and was the next one Saturday
[1:46:55] morning and she said she was cleaning
[1:46:58] the room the Holy Spirit came down her
[1:46:59] and said her name every under name was
[1:47:01] and she said don't make fun of that
[1:47:05] preacher he's preaching my word and so
[1:47:09] she came to me after the service the
[1:47:10] next day and repented because she was
[1:47:12] making fun of in her mind she was
[1:47:14] looking down upon my emotion in my zeal
[1:47:17] for Christ and she apologized in front
[1:47:19] of the pastor
[1:47:21] she thought we were having supper after
[1:47:22] the service and she apologized
[1:47:23] afterwards so that's one time I know God
[1:47:25] vindicated it's okay for me to get free
[1:47:28] to spear amen
[1:47:29] it's okay to show emotion right but she
[1:47:31] was sitting there the whole time and she
[1:47:33] wasn't saying oh you're just a nonsense
[1:47:34] message preacher you know she wasn't
[1:47:36] saying that she was just in there like
[1:47:38] everybody else but see God knows the
[1:47:41] reigns of our mission oh god I search in
[1:47:44] your heart as a man my man said your
[1:47:46] thoughts right now louder in heaven your
[1:47:48] actions are right now I thought what
[1:47:52] should we be thinking all things are
[1:47:53] possible
[1:47:54] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:47:55] and forever I believe in the Word of God
[1:47:58] I believe the Holy Ghost as wine and oil
[1:47:59] I believe it's for somebody today and
[1:48:02] then see we think well I've got it I see
[1:48:06] you're not living with eternal life but
[1:48:07] this isn't for me this isn't you're not
[1:48:09] living for others right and you're
[1:48:11] saying I'm not hungry we don't want to
[1:48:13] want more of God who doesn't one

[1:48:18] kombucha who wouldn't want enough fresh
[1:48:20] mason kombucha or kefir who would I'm on
[1:48:22] that I know Lord likes dr. pepper

[1:48:31] Holy Ghost in the head who doesn't like
[1:48:33] that
[1:48:33] who doesn't like a fresh meal from God a
[1:48:36] fresh Word of God but we got to come
[1:48:38] hungry to the house of God amen not blow
[1:48:41] up see people can blow up and I don't I
[1:48:43] might not see it on their faces but by
[1:48:46] their actions they blow up it shows that
[1:48:48] got old you said formal starchy sniff
[1:48:51] experience we got to be flexible and say
[1:48:53] on I love you Jesus I'll do whatever you

[1:49:00] get more of myself to you I'm willing to
[1:49:02] sacrifice more Lorenzo and Dan better go

[1:49:19] skinned can I say like that freshly
[1:49:21] skinned with all the oil so you can pour
[1:49:23] wine in there

[1:49:26] that was I'd be old skidded old message
[1:49:29] believers that don't want to move to the
[1:49:30] Holy Spirit we want to see more of God
[1:49:32] we want to see gifts we want to see
[1:49:34] interpretations we want to see
[1:49:35] revelations we want to see all God has
[1:49:37] for you and whatever he has you wanted

[1:50:05] I want more of you not well I'm a
[1:50:08] message believer this isn't for me I've
[1:50:09] been a message on these years that's the
[1:50:12] wrong attitude
[1:50:13] that's a a worldly because that's a
[1:50:17] worldly stuff attitude I don't know
[1:50:20] what's a stuffed buffet attitude I know
[1:50:23] how to say that you're just so full with
[1:50:25] the world you have nothing no hunger for
[1:50:27] God what you been looking at what's been
[1:50:30] doing on your phone what you've been
[1:50:31] doing in your free time
[1:50:32] what do we do it we must be doing things
[1:50:34] for the kingdom of God amen must be
[1:50:36] feeding on the Word of God and let me go
[1:50:39] this time five agree just in about four
[1:50:40] years I want to bring it out the thought
[1:50:42] Katie this morning in Esther chapter
[1:50:44] five
[1:50:45] I'm sorry Esther chapter two remember
[1:50:49] this type Vashti was the queen you
[1:50:53] missed - what what is her name meanie
[1:50:55] name I remember means beautiful Vashti
[1:50:58] was a beautiful woman and say like this
[1:51:00] she was a beautiful church and she must
[1:51:02] have been merged and before she got
[1:51:04] married because she could be queen that
[1:51:07] sound familiar
[1:51:08] foolish virgin right she was beautiful
[1:51:12] church in the boost version is a
[1:51:13] beautiful church it is because their
[1:51:15] version to the where they're not having
[1:51:17] intercourse with the world right and
[1:51:19] having daily interactions are not with
[1:51:21] the homosexuals all things things like
[1:51:22] that they're they're pure to the word
[1:51:26] and the Bible said that the king called
[1:51:30] for Vashti to come show herself before
[1:51:32] and the king is all full of stimulation
[1:51:35] I want to know my church to be seen
[1:51:38] all of these these leaders to see the
[1:51:40] real church in action and she said no
[1:51:43] I'm having my party I'm having my wine
[1:51:45] party with the churches I'm not coming
[1:51:47] this to your party
[1:51:49] see that she denied the word yet she's
[1:51:53] having her own life part that's what
[1:51:55] about us in a wine banquet in other
[1:51:57] words she was being stimulated with
[1:51:59] anointing but when it come down to
[1:52:01] obeying the word look she couldn't obey
[1:52:03] the word the presence of the king are
[1:52:05] you with me she went away the word in
[1:52:07] the presence of the king she wouldn't go
[1:52:09] further with God to obey the Word of God
[1:52:11] Church me to go further with nothing
[1:52:13] ma'am we need to keep seeking after God
[1:52:15] don't stop seeking after God once you
[1:52:17] get the message to get baptized right
[1:52:19] away keep seeking out your God a man she
[1:52:22] said I'm going this far King and I'm not
[1:52:24] going any further
[1:52:25] that's a denominational spirit that's
[1:52:27] why she has to be purged during the
[1:52:28] tribulation because she's mixed with the
[1:52:31] denominations and she won't go further
[1:52:32] into the true Tolman of the word that's
[1:52:35] right she was having her own banquet see
[1:52:39] she like she wanted to be anointed to be
[1:52:42] recognized by the churches my desirable
[1:52:46] aim is not to see how other churches
[1:52:47] think we're a great Church my desire to
[1:52:49] be anointed so the king will love me so
[1:52:52] I can serve the King better with me so
[1:52:54] I'm hoping the king that's how I want to
[1:52:56] be anointed not to please other churches
[1:52:57] not to impress you know other churches
[1:53:00] around this area but so that we can
[1:53:02] please the King and do it the King say
[1:53:04] that's exactly right
[1:53:06] what's Esther me star everybody's a
[1:53:09] night stars amen
[1:53:11] she was beautiful but Esther was a saw
[1:53:14] ha ha ha I know there goes for
[1:53:17] simulations they've had a revelation she
[1:53:20] was the star of God so what an Esther do
[1:53:27] she obeyed everything heavy I said only
[1:53:30] what he said and that pleased the king
[1:53:33] she became queen remember that and then
[1:53:36] she had at the time of the death at the
[1:53:38] time of persecution she had two banquets
[1:53:41] the first one was the banquet of wine
[1:53:44] remember that Esther chapter 5 she had a
[1:53:47] wine banquet in other words she knew
[1:53:49] what the king light
[1:53:52] the King liked to drink wine praise the
[1:53:54] Lord and she could prepare it and the
[1:53:59] king loved this when the King say the
[1:54:01] king said Oh Esther I give half half the
[1:54:02] kingdom and she said what do you want he
[1:54:05] said give me one more party let's have
[1:54:07] one more banquet last you tomorrow night
[1:54:09] so one banquet party was enough she
[1:54:12] needed the second annoyed day she needed
[1:54:14] a double anointing are with me church a
[1:54:17] former rain and a ladder draining
[1:54:20] programs that the rapture the church
[1:54:21] will be what the refilling of the Holy
[1:54:23] Ghost one banquet one parties on a note
[1:54:26] we need another praise God
[1:54:29] amen ah see that she just wanted to
[1:54:36] impress the churches with her anointing
[1:54:37] but Esther knew the King called her and
[1:54:41] she knew she was accepted that she knew
[1:54:43] it the King like if God is going to hear
[1:54:45] my prayer I'm going to touch God's heart
[1:54:46] I've got to prepare something he loves
[1:54:48] and that involves line that involves
[1:54:51] stimulation the King loves stimulation
[1:54:53] amen
[1:54:54] that's exactly right remember this this
[1:54:59] type ties in exactly with magic 22 when
[1:55:01] the King if I wasn't tell them which
[1:55:04] I've been in Matthew 22 for behold I
[1:55:07] prepared my dinner my oxen and my
[1:55:08] fatlings are killed and all things are
[1:55:11] ready come into the marriage to see it's
[1:55:14] the same thing both both stories have a
[1:55:17] king who's having a feast having a
[1:55:19] supper right and only the ones that come
[1:55:22] are the ones who are the true bride
[1:55:24] right one of them was taken out right
[1:55:26] the man without the garden was taking
[1:55:28] off some was Haman taken out crazy God
[1:55:31] will fan the banquet opened up half
[1:55:34] blind with the king but both were taken
[1:55:36] out and only the true bride was left you
[1:55:38] can say unto that only the true bride
[1:55:41] will stay at the wine the wine banquet
[1:55:43] right that's exactly right and that ties
[1:55:47] in with our prophecy for our day Joel -
[1:55:50] 23 to 26 we'll have plenty of wheat and
[1:55:54] plenty of wine oils remember that I
[1:55:57] don't go along I think I'm trying to run
[1:55:59] me off forgive me let me try to close I
[1:56:00] hope that is all that's still your
[1:56:02] vision church that's all
[1:56:03] mission it thus saith the Lord the bride
[1:56:05] has had plenty of wine and plenty of oil
[1:56:08] amen
[1:56:08] and if we're honest let's look at our
[1:56:10] church and say God help us have more
[1:56:12] wine than any man and who brought you
[1:56:15] who brought the wife who got the oil the
[1:56:17] Old Testament to the house of God it was
[1:56:18] the people and that it could smiie all
[1:56:21] of us was have a hidden prayer life with
[1:56:24] Christ and we must bring the anointing
[1:56:26] this church hey Manny let's say to our
[1:56:28] feet I better cook I'm going to none now
[1:56:39] if you're not more together the Holy
[1:56:40] Ghost that's alright because the Holy
[1:56:43] Ghost is here to help people who need
[1:56:44] that in years past I've always just laid
[1:56:48] hands I've just laid here but I found
[1:56:49] maybe that's not the way to do it I
[1:56:51] found by the brand of Nod there are
[1:56:53] times do that going in a row we want to
[1:56:55] listen let your brother brand I'll share
[1:56:57] my time we're looking for the brand
[1:57:00] he'll let the people just lay there and
[1:57:01] pray there's times you praise and
[1:57:04] receive the Holy Ghost lays hands with
[1:57:05] us other times like an Albuquerque where
[1:57:07] he just lets them pray until somebody
[1:57:08] gets a breakthrough so I want to offer
[1:57:13] that today and also offer another time
[1:57:15] the people want the Holy Ghost it's here
[1:57:19] what spirit is guiding me not preach
[1:57:21] anything off the word today and I'm free
[1:57:23] to Antichrist doctrine are there they
[1:57:25] say oh you don't need the wine and oil
[1:57:26] oh you got it if you're just justified
[1:57:28] no you don't you got to go justification
[1:57:30] sanctification that's just with all to
[1:57:32] go in we've seen all people that all
[1:57:34] tried to put walk through the motions of
[1:57:36] being baptized but never really
[1:57:38] repenting and never really getting the
[1:57:40] wine annoying man you've all seen that
[1:57:42] oh I know I do I know so much Niger is
[1:57:44] really hungered and thirsted for the
[1:57:45] baptism all he goes I don't know I want
[1:57:49] to offer it and as I close I want to use
[1:57:55] Luke 10 the story of the Good Samaritan
[1:58:00] remember brother Simon last year
[1:58:02] preached the healing prescription on
[1:58:03] Wednesday night remember that that was a
[1:58:05] masterpiece the healing prescription
[1:58:07] what was Jesus is healing prescription
[1:58:10] as the Good Samaritan pouring oil and
[1:58:12] wine I remember that
[1:58:17] when we're sick and wounded and broken
[1:58:18] what is Christ gonna pour in he's a
[1:58:20] foreigner oil he's going to port in line
[1:58:23] amen
[1:58:23] and then for the RAM said he takes you
[1:58:26] to the end which is he says a local
[1:58:27] church
[1:58:28] he said in the pastor Jesus will give
[1:58:30] the pastor two pens to take care of you
[1:58:32] he's in that pastor will need you the
[1:58:34] rest of the way I hope we know how
[1:58:37] closely connected the rapture is with
[1:58:39] the fivefold ministry in the local
[1:58:40] church hope you know that because Jesus
[1:58:43] takes him to a local church we have to
[1:58:46] have a local church to them we have to
[1:58:49] stay in our post of duty but what we
[1:58:52] want is we want to get the Baptist all
[1:58:54] he goes they then find our position the
[1:58:55] church not just come to church and try
[1:58:57] to find a position and then fall out of
[1:58:59] church but stay in the church the man
[1:59:02] should stay to the rapture or stay tuned
[1:59:04] you go to meet the Lord by the grave
[1:59:09] last Bodhi says he says if you're really
[1:59:15] determined to stay on the road with this
[1:59:18] leader the Holy Spirit stay right with
[1:59:19] the word and if you stay with the spirit
[1:59:21] we'll keep you in the word that's right
[1:59:23] it'll take you right along the line the
[1:59:25] path of the word and don't be afraid it
[1:59:27] won't hurt nothing it'll just help you
[1:59:30] if you are hurt it will heal all the
[1:59:32] hurts the Holy Spirit will so if you're
[1:59:36] not born again the Holy Ghost is here
[1:59:38] for you today if you think you're born
[1:59:40] again believe you're born again praise
[1:59:41] God but if you're hurt and the Holy
[1:59:43] Ghost is here for that too but that's
[1:59:46] the Holy Ghost will never hurt you it
[1:59:48] will heal let's just our head for a
[1:59:51] moment remorse if you come here let's
[1:59:55] just play that spirit living God all
[1:59:57] fresh I don't know if anyone's seeking
[1:59:59] the Holy Ghost but all's I know is I
[2:00:00] felt like God changed my message this
[2:00:02] morning to preach this and it may be
[2:00:05] building I know that as well I
[2:00:07] understand that but I want to preach
[2:00:11] what brother Adam preached I want to
[2:00:13] preach what Paul preached
[2:00:15] the Holy Ghost is oil and wine it is a
[2:00:19] baptism and then the stimulation that
[2:00:21] comes from the revelation of the word of
[2:00:24] God and it brings joy overflooded gives
[2:00:29] you a life of service programs that held
[2:00:35] them so they can even be slaughtered and
[2:00:37] martyred and it never left him he said
[2:00:39] the effects of the holy spirit never
[2:00:41] left them the rest of their lives I can
[2:00:43] say amen to that
[2:00:44] the effects of what got into me when I
[2:00:46] came the message has never left me
[2:00:49] amen I've never went back out to the
[2:00:51] world I've never back slid like that
[2:00:53] it's never left me because it's a seal
[2:00:57] to the day of my rejection
[2:01:00] it's the healing prescription then widen
[2:01:05] oil that's that word prayer and I will
[2:01:07] see if anyone wants have any prayer for
[2:01:09] this and if we don't have anybody then
[2:01:11] we're just going to pray for the whole
[2:01:12] church
