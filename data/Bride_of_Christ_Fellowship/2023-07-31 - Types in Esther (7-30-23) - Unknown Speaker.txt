for all the efforts Lord anoint us for today in Jesus Christ's name amen amen praise God let's take our Bibles here this morning I'd like to go to the Book of Esther it's been a while since I preached on Esther so I kind of wanted to revisit that I heard A good sermon on it uh last or this month earlier this month and then I got a text from Zur about Esther so I thought well that's pretty uh pretty interesting you know you look for Witnesses in your life you know and so I've been studying on this a little bit and I trust the Lord will speak to us here today by God's grace I just want to show there's there seems to be three different uh types with Esther's life here so we'll look at those three today and I'm probably gonna use the mic is that okay occasions that every everybody can hear me better if I use the mind okay and I want the live streamers to be able to hear so God bless the live streamers hopefully brother bang sister see you God bless you we pray for you and brother Jose God bless you love you brother look forward to seeing you sometime soon here by God's grace Esther chapter 2 I'm not going to have any slides today because there are so many different thoughts that I had to write down that I just didn't have time for actually maybe I'll have just a couple slides in just a moment but let's read our text here so we could see what the Lord would speak to us here we're sorry about that pardon me I thought I'd turn that off Esther chapter 2 verse 15 Esther 2 15. of course this is the moment Esther is brought into the king and just a beautiful type here of the bride and Christ Hallelujah I'll read 15 and 16 and then we can all read 17 about the grace of God now when the turn of Esther the daughter of abahale the uncle Mordecai who had taken her for his daughter was come to go in unto the king she required nothing but what haggai the king's Chamberlain The Keeper of the women appointed and Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her so Esther was taken unto King ahaziwaris into his house Royal in the 10th month which is the month of Tibet in the seventh year of his reign so let's read verse 17 ready one two three and the King love Esther above all the women and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins so that he set the Royal Crown upon her head and made her Queen instead of ashtime Amen may God has blessings his reading of his word you may be seated see I do have a few slides here just to show a couple things so I would like to look at Esther types of the Gentile bride and the squeeze before the rapture um I just thought you know I saw this this week I thought I would update the church a little bit you know from time to time we talk about end time events and this looked like another sign of The Binding of the tares we know it's been going on of course whether Ram saw the world economical Council the war council of churches you know he saw Pentecost who's uniting with them when he was alive he talked about that he warned demon shakarian was a prominent leader of the Pentecostals he was United with the Roman Catholics in his day brother man worn them on tape called his name and then he apologized for calling his name the next service but he kept warning the people after that don't yoke up with denominations and of course we saw I think back in 2015 right when Tony Palmer was a Catholic priest I think of a charismatic Catholic church and then he helped unite Kenneth Hagin who was the successor of Oral Roberts he helped unite them to the pope and then uh brother Stewart Tony Stewart died in a motorcycle accident just months after that he was hit head-on and he Tony claimed to be Elijah and so I've always thought I just said well that seems to be like a warning from God he claimed to be coming in Elijah uniting the the Protestant Catholic but God had already sent Elijah through brother Branham to warn us not to unite with Catholicism so that was just you know what eight years ago but I saw this week I was a you know I always listen to sermons and I heard a sermon from a Ministry called the good fight Ministry which I liked they do a lot of updates with culture they did the video they sold their souls for rock and roll I don't know if you've seen that but that was quite a video so anyways uh the uh a man named Bill Johnson he runs a Bethel Church which is a heretical church it's a it's like a Pentecostal church but I believe they actually impart demons into people I believe I can prove that you know if I showed you the video you'd see it and of course they're Doctrine they pray for people until like they do all kinds of flipping and flopping and uh they speak all this all these things and I believe it's actually human possession that that's I believe that's provable because they're so off the word of God anyways he's a very prominent uh a preacher his wife is the one that would lay she died of cancer this year but she was one that would lay on Graves and try to soak in people's anointings that's that's one example of how we know their demon possessed you don't get anointings by laying on people's Graves that's demonic anyways he put out this post uh for Catholics and Protestants to come together on August 4th in Portugal it's a million dollar event they've raised almost a million dollars to have this and the whole point is uh well there's a scripture the scripture says Jesus says Gather ye together at first that tears and bind them in bundles before the we is gathered so we have to see The ecumenical move unite first before the rapture and of course we know they will brother Branham said um the church is in America will Unite with American politicians to change the laws in order to kill Christians that's the simplest way to say it I believe that'll be the sign the squeeze is on when the United States the Beast of the land gets the power to kill Christians but we don't know when that will be we see we see birth pains right we see coven where they almost mandated vaccines you know now they're going after Trump he's just a conservative but they're trying to arrest him so we can see the process right mandates and arresting anyone who stands against the policies of the government so we can see it getting closer and closer um but Jesus said they must be bound first and it's a possible I just you know when whenever they have an event like this and music is involved it's a possible type of Daniel 3 15 right with Shadrach Meshach and Abednego you know that story is a type as well right where all the Believers are I'm sorry everyone had to bow down to the one image now that's very similar to the image of the Beast which is the Pope right there's one image everyone has to bow down to or they die that's the Pope and brother random of course use that example the program thought that image might be uh might have been Daniel well it could have been but we're not told in the scripture um and then that's an interesting type you know uh some people say brother Branham is that image and everyone has to bow down to brother random and that I don't know it could be I I personally believe though the image is the pope that's personally my opinion I could be wrong but the uh Shadrach Meshach and Abednego they all had to bow down when the music was playing so I just think it's interesting you know that this is what it says it says join join us for this transformative worship and evangelization event where Catholics and Protestants together will unite the flame of Faith unite the body of Christ and bring the message of the Gospel to every person don't miss this opportunity to be a part of the change and then they have a list of speakers down there I didn't zoom in I'm not real familiar with any of them other than Heidi Baker she's the one that preaches at Bethel she has her own Ministry but she preaches at Bethel and she prays for people and they get this this uh painful anointing on them and I believe it's a demonic anointing because of the way they they act and we oh yeah the man from Jesus from the chosen is in there Jesus from the chosen that Catholic guy who I never watched chosen but he's a speaker there so just interesting you know as we uh as we get closer we're going to see more of this likely more and more uh the people coming together Matt Mayer we saw him at the concert at mayor so he wasn't singing about Mary so that's okay with me but uh you know they're they're trying to unite together uh and of course we know Church they're not a part of the body of Christ until they're born again right or if you're predestinated to eternal life then you're part of the body of Christ but um Catholics who deny the word of God or deny the baptism Holy Ghost we know any Catholic would not be born again because they're staying in denomination and the Holy Ghost is saying come out of her my people so we believe it's impossible for anyone in a Catholic church or Baptist to be born again I believe it's impossible because the Bible says come out of her right yeah and all the children of God all the elect of God will come out of organization but there could be people in there that would be saved um and just you know another man uh I can't think of his name now but he was a prominent he's a friend of Bill Johnson Louis Engel Louis angle I think that's his name a couple years ago they had another meeting like this with Catholics and the Protestant preachers bowed down and kiss the feet of the Catholic priests I've got the video I could show it to you so I'm just letting you know this that's worship that's man-made worship they were apologizing yeah the Protestant preachers were apologizing for blasting the Catholics and so he actually got down on his face and kissed the feet of those Catholics and so that's absolute worship that's heresy that's sinful and I'm just just a reminder just was a reminder to me this week um that The Binding of the tares has to happen first I know Simon preached that a few weeks ago I preached that years and years ago because I've been a pastor all these years um but just an interesting um sign about how this is getting closer all the time and also you know before I read this quote from about the seven Thunders there was a uh an article I I read a couple weeks ago I saved it for a while it was on Newsmax and uh it said the Catholic church is doing studies to see whether they could include lgbqt whatever all that include them into the ministry and they also want to include women becoming priests and so I just thought it was another sign you know we're wondering is the Catholic Church going to unite with all the homosexual agenda I don't know it would seem like they would have to if they're going to convince the whole world to follow the pope that's what it would seem like to me but also Jesus said it's got to be so close it might deceive the very elective or possible how close would that be so we don't know but just I'm just giving you a couple of those are two updates right just two recent news events on Prophecy like brother random preach modern events made clear by prophecy right so we can see those now last week for some reason I forgot to read this quote so I'm sorry I preached on the uh just revisiting the seven Thunders last week because we had two questions in the church about it and uh the sermon is now online yeah I think this term is now on YouTube but they asked brother Branham you know about a year and a half before he died uh someone said brother brown with your experience the Lord has given you for his people would you be eligible to write a Bible yourself if God manifests it I said well that might be true but see he was trying to catch me so the devil anointed some man to try to say brother do you want to write your own Bible now that's what the Mormons have done that's what the Jehovah's Witness had done they've taken and that's what really every other Bible translation has done it's a different Bible because they have different Scrolls I don't go too hard on that but uh it's the truth and uh I'm not like a King James only I'm gonna rebuke you if you're not King James only I'm not like that but uh it's the facts you know every other Bible translation uses different Scrolls and so they get a different translation it's always a shorter translation they're always taking out of the word of God is always shorter because they have to have a copyright they've got to have a different certain percentage to make a copyright but look it's it's the enemy trying to tempt brother Brandon write your own Bible write your own Bible and I said but you see I couldn't do that he said why couldn't you you have all the qualifications you have signs wonders Miracles you speak in the name of the Lord you prophesy but look one word cannot be added or taken away I love these stories where they challenge brother Branham but brother Adam always goes back to the word of God Amen 11. he said well then them seven Thunders you see winning them seven Thunders blasting about won't the won't that be a revelation be give to some man this is why I believe that seven Thunders are already revealed I said no sir it would be adding something to it or taking something from it it's all revealed in there and the Seven Seals opened up the revelation of what that was so this quote goes along with the questions and answers quote uh from August of 64 where brother random said the seven Thunders were already revealed in the Seven Seals okay he said that's what it was see it's still in the word you see you can't get out of that word it won't leave that word and God's spirit will never leave that word it'll stay right with the word blinding some and Open the Eyes of others it'll always do that so that's one I'm sorry I left that out for some reason I forgot to leave that out I was listening to a sermon this week and uh the brother Danny steaman from Florida and he mentioned that quote okay so I'm going to detach there just because I don't have all my thoughts organized I kind of need them open on a couple different screens here by God's grace okay so let's preach a little bit here on Esther um and I look at the types of the bride and The Squeeze by God's grace so I was listening to a sermon from July from brother Donnie Reagan's church and the brother preached on Esther it was a tremendous service it was a really anointed service I really enjoyed it I was listening to it while I was moaning and I got a text from Sir about Esther and I started studying again I'm like well I'd like to preach that again so we like to do that today that's kind of like the background of it that sermon that I heard was from July 2nd and the brother had a lot of good points now the reason I want to preach it just because he had he he taught it he preached it in a different way I'd never seen him before and so I want to explain his way and then away brother Branham typed it and then the way that I would uh that I I preached as well by God's grace so maybe have your Bible handy and we'll read through Esther uh just we'll hit a few highlights from the book by the grace of the Lord okay so for the first type this is a brother random quote brother random said you are like Esther and vashti is a person that's ashamed of Jesus and the baptism of the Holy Ghost so this is a different quote or this is a different type because you alone are Esther you're the one who goes in there not the whole bride of Christ but just the individual okay which that you you could use that right because we know the Bible says we should be married to the Lord Jesus Christ in Romans chapter 7. so brother Ram says this in Phoenix 1962. now we find out she vashti now if Ashley means beautiful right so let's keep that in mind she's a beautiful woman right and uhuris or Xerxes wanted to show her beauty to all the men that were part of his his Feast she was beautiful but beauty without character is Satan hallelujah amen so no matter how beautiful or how handsome or how strong you know you can be or how whatever we can accomplish physically that means nothing what God wants is obedience to the word of God Amen right we found out vashi commits spiritual fornication going out with the world professing something living something different that won't never work what the church ought to do is like Esther did Esther refused the adorning of the world he says now we know that little Book of Esther how that Mordecai his uncle had a daughter and he was and he was down during the times of the Reigns and the medes and Persians there's a very beautiful type there the king one of the greatest kings in the world that day he had a a great feast and he called the queen to come set by him and she didn't want to do it she refused to do it so what did he do he was so humiliated didn't know what to do that his own wife wouldn't come okay so think about that uh it's a it's humiliating to Jesus right it's humiliated to Jesus the Bible also says in Psalm chapter 2 kiss the sun lest ye be angry so it makes the Lord angry in other words the wrath of God comes on people that won't worship God the way he wants to be worshiped that includes shouting right crying weeping rejoicing signing and crying for the Abominations speaking in tongues prophesying Hallelujah in other words you giving all your emotions to God anyone that won't worship God that way the Pentecostal way it angers God it upsets God said I think that's a whole lot like Christ today Christ has invited us a set in Heavenly places with him he said and we're ashamed to do it now not us but the denominations right we're not ashamed we love the prince of God Amen he said many people are ashamed to say that they got the baptism of the Holy Ghost Pentecostal people that's right they're ashamed to say it he said we're ashamed of him not speaking of Pentecostal not brother Branham okay so it means a lot church for us to be able to uh to enjoy the prince of God it really is a blessing church when you can be free in the holy spirit amen right it really is something when you can raise your hands and when you can shout or when you can praise God or you can scream or you can dance around the church amen it really is a victory praise God because that's what Jesus wants Jesus wants you know all your love right amen he wants you fully surrendered to him and as I said before if you can't uh surrender your wallet to God how's he going to get into your soul how are you going to surrender your soul that's right if you want to surrender and Let Jesus into your your bedroom and and uh you know keep keep your your life clean in your bedroom you know how how is he going to get into your soul if you can't get into your bedroom if you can't get into you using a cell phone how's he going to get into your soul right if you can't get into my preaching I'm bringing me in this now if he can't get in my preaching how's he going to get into my soul but I know he's in my preaching amen because he proves it over and over again it just as an example uh uh Thursday we went to the Amish community or the former Honors Community The Junction City Saints it's gonna take me a while to get over that um and I preach on the anointed ones at the end time we had a great time now Kai went with him he had a wonderful time in the Lord um and one of the sisters named Ruth came up and she said brother Jesse I just want to tell you I was wondering about that all day about the anointed ones the end times and how can people get the anointing and she said you came and preached exactly what I was wondering about amen and the elder brother Irvin got up there and said he said I almost thought about uh asking Jesse to preach on a certain topic but I said no I'll let the Holy Ghost preach I'll let the Holy Ghost decide what we have needed amen amen and he said to answer all of our questions and helped us so much so I just thought that was another good example of how I want to yield my gift to Christ we all want to yield Our Lives to Christ amen praise God that's we had a great time in the Lord there uh and Lord willing that tonight I'll teach on can Satan heal and of course the answer is no but I ended the sermon with that on Thursday night so I'll teach the little ones that if they want to sit up front and we can do it like that again or if you all want me to preach you can all have you preach if you want I know they like to sit up front by God's grace but uh that's the first type so that's the interesting type I actually never saw that until yesterday only said Esther 15 times so he didn't use it a whole lot and most of the times we're in that sermon uh the marriage supper the lamb from 1962. okay now the second type was this was the new one I'd never heard before either and this is the one the brother preached from earlier this month wonderful brother like I said it was a tremendous sermon but there's a few few things I didn't agree and church as we go on there's types in this story that they they don't make sense yeah Yeah okay or they're not in the right order okay um so we got to just keep that in mind and and again it's always they're just types and shadows they're not a perfect realization as we'll see you know some of these things are a little out of order or not quite sure who more for me I'm not sure who Mordecai represents or Hagee eye or I'm not quite sure how this uh works out but we can definitely see numerous types in there okay so the brother uh earlier this month preached and his type was the New Testament bride just of laodicea so from Brother branham's day on to us so from Brother man's day to us we are the Bride of Esther so that means none of the other six Church Ages were Esther now that's interesting I don't agree with that but it's just interesting I never thought of that before um and uh vashti then would be the denominations of the legacian church age who wouldn't move on with Christ now they do have a quote for this uh this is marriage and divorce uh 1965. this is the first sermon I let Kristen listen to I don't advise you if you're witnessing to share that to be the first sermon for somebody it shows God's grace is with me that's all I can say and I guess you know I guess I shared with her because we were one to be married and I wanted her to see uh the true revelation of it but there's a lot of hard statements in there and some of them I just I honestly think brother random just misworded there are a few things he said like he said uh brother man said Satan was Eve's designer well some people take that well how could Satan create E's physical body well that's not what program was meant he meant Satan was influencing Eve's mind right to disbelieve God's word but Satan didn't design Eve God designed right in her body and everything like that so you have to rightly divide everything or else you're going to end up with some evil spirits right people the devil will take a thought of brother Brown that was just his own idea or he missed said something and the devil will take that and run with that yeah so we have to be very careful to rightly divide the word of Truth I love that sermon though it's a beautiful sermon but again maybe not the best thing to send to somebody or their first time here brother randbridge or I could use it you know either one so brother man says in marriage and divorce any woman that refuses a man is child has no right to be a wife to him you remember the Bible when the King married Esther because the queen bashed he now he didn't save actually but because the queen refused he just got him another one what happened when she refused to come out with the King and Obey him the same thing it is with a woman that refuses to be wife to her husband so speaking of vashti he says now now he does the type and so it is with the church that refused to become pregnated in the age that we now live in to bring forth children of this age we are not lutherans we're not Wesley's neither are we Pentecostals we got to be the children of this age through the pregnancy of the word of God Amen to bring forth a child of this age the sea child amen I hope you understand could it be pregnant and no so what'd he do he put her away in divorcement that's right but she theresent put him away he put her away so we again see that type that nobody can put Christ away right because he's God of the universe amen man right but it's Christ who could put a church away all right so there's the two types there uh no they're interesting and uh now I'm going to go through the way I preach it before and the way I taught it I'm going to bring in a few new thoughts then I really have never seen some of these thoughts and they're really beautiful uh by the grace of the Lord okay so Esther chapter two here verse one let's go to Esther two verse one we know Esther chapter one is all about vashti the beautiful church that's put away so we're familiar with that so Esther 2 verse 1. and we'll read verses one and two after these things when the wrath of king of azureus was a piece he remembered vashti and what she had done and what was decreed against her then said the king's servants that ministered unto him let there be fair young virgins sought for the king and let the king appoint officers and all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins under shushan the palace to the house of the women under the custody of haggai the king's Chamberlain Keeper of the women and let their things for purification be given them okay so the first thought I found out I hear was there were many virgins right many virgins were brought in to be royalty Hallelujah but there's only one of them that became the bride Hallelujah and so I believe this is a beautiful type of the wise and foolish virgins amen amen don't you they're all virgins that none of them nobody could say Well they're not virgin they were all proven to be but only one could become Queen Hallelujah and so that's a the first type there a beautiful type I thought I'd bring out there I've never seen that one before until this when I started studying this now I believe though the vashti though represents and because there's uh scripture on this now I'm going to read Esther 1 verse 10. on the seventh day when the heart of the King was married with wine he commanded me human bista harbona big thought there's some big names here and abagtha and zethar and car cash the seven chamberlains that serve in the prince of hazardous the king to bring vashi the queen before the king with the Crown Royal to show the people and the princes are Beauty for she was fair to look upon okay so notice she's brought in on the seventh day okay now I believe that 7 types the seventh Old Testament Church age okay now as I said the brother would type that the Seventh Day represent the seven Church age so I could maybe see that but I see more types that work in the way that I've preached it and taught it before seven represents completion so the Old Testament was completed after vashti was put away and the King started a new covenant actually switched back up here I'd have a couple more slides to show I just hate to flip back and forth because of some of the notes I have I didn't get a chance to put them up there so I preached this uh was it two years ago uh brother Brandon did say there was Old Testament Church ages and it's a really beautiful type four of these ages type out perfectly as far as I can see or near perfect so the Old Testament First Church age was Solomon and that's a beautiful type he wrote the Bible Paul wrote the Bible uh he was a he was a builder Paul laid the foundation I mean it's a beautiful type that's an absolute beautiful type now I don't know about Joseph at uziah Hezekiah but I can clearly see Luther represents Josiah because Josiah found the word of God and it transformed his heart so did Luther he found the just shall live by faith and it totally transformed his heart it's like he never knew the Bible before right and now he knew the Bible and started a great reformation and then Ezra was typed by uh Wesley I forget the types in that one but clearly clearly we can see how the Old Testament ended with Elijah yes amen hallelujah the Old Testament ended with Elijah that was on John the Baptist right and the New Testament ends with the last messenger brother Branham who is Anointed with the spirit of Elijah praise God okay so to me vashi being put away on the seventh day uh represented God putting Israel away on the seventh and final Old Testament Church age now I have a few scriptures for this now here in the Old Testament their Church age was about a thousand years their Church ages our church ages are about 2 000 years I don't know why what did I do oh yeah those last two were missing there okay so it's just interesting you know uh John the Baptist at about a three and a half year Ministry there no I'm sorry I had a six you had a six month Ministry but yeah then it lasted three and a half years Jesus died that started the New Testament right so that John's Ministry and Jesus ministry about three and a half or four years however long doesn't really matter the exact number of years but anyways it was a short Church age and of course our church age our church age is now tied with um Ephesus for being 117 years long it's hard to believe I did that seven years ago my goodness so anyways you can clearly see there are Church ages in the Old Testament and the New Testament and uh some people question us on that but remember the Bible said in Ephesians and Colossians that there were ages in the past and there'll be aged in the future so if there's ages in the past and age in the future there's got to be ages right now in the church Angels there's always been ages praise God so anyone that says their churches aren't in the Bible they don't they haven't read the Bible they need to read the Bible and they need to get studied up by God's grace if you draw that to God God will draw an eye to you amen that's right now after the Jewish Queen uh of the Persian King Xerxes types the New Testament bright church so I believe astrotypes from Paul or the the church ages all the way down to us Esther is a type of the entire bride Church right but especially we see it at the end time you know with the two Banquets we see there with the former latter rain and I believe Israel uh is the type of vashi being blinded and put away you know why because we have a scripture for that we have a scripture she was actually Queen she actually received seed from the King right she actually was had the personal experience with the King but she had to be put away by divorce and we actually have scripture for that so I'm going to read that Isaiah 50 verse 1. I'll read that for you by God's grace some people don't know this and then they get kind of confused and mixed up on uh understanding Israel's place Isaiah 50 verse 1. did I put it in here no I didn't okay so that's why I want to read it Isaiah 51. turn it with one hand is a lot slower than two so pardon me about that Isaiah 50 verse 1. thus said the Lord where is the Bill of your mother's divorcement whom I have put away or which of my creditors is to whom I have sold you behold for your iniquities have you sold yourselves and for your transgressions is your mother put away now look at this it's plain God only put Israel away because they transgressed against the Covenant that'll be encouragement to us we're going to always be always be the Bride of Jesus Christ because we're always going to keep the Covenant praise God yes we're going to have little uh minor sins brother says we're gonna have we're going to sin daily but if we do what Paul says if we die daily Jesus won't put us away Hallelujah we'll always be his bride hallelujah amen Christians have struggled that for 2 000 years but here as as we get towards the end we see all the scriptures they're all pointing to God always forgiving us and we're God's beloved and God's word never fails uh uh there's no charges against us there's no condemnation to the Bride of Jesus Christ we must understand and believe we're God's beloved praise God Amen remember it's Satan's job to discourage you is Satan's job to think well God maybe hasn't God maybe God hasn't forgiven you right right or maybe uh maybe you're a Judas like the brother was telling me is that the mower guy now guy can you go tell him I'm not sure what he needs there that doesn't happen very often does it Hallelujah yeah I told him the wedding was on the uh the 12th I told him I told him to come earlier so I gave him a note with the date on it and everything we'll just see if he needs anything cars uh you need your car your car moved off the grass or just say sorry about that it was polite sorry about that Saints that's already does come on Sunday oh that's right no one comes on set that's right yeah sorry about that uh Jeremiah let's go to Jeremiah 3 verse 8. Jeremiah 3 verse 8 and I saw when for all the causes whereby backslitting Israel committed adultery I had her put away and given her a bill of divorce yet her treacherous sister due to fear not but went and played the Harlot also so again we see Israel committing spiritual adulteries against God they're backslidden and notice again no fear of the Lord now church I don't encourage us there are certain sins we'll just never do right why because we fear God so see the presence of the fear of God in your life the reason you won't go so far the reason you you'll never do those things the reason you have that is to protect your life praise God yes and that again proves you're the Bride of Jesus Christ amen Israel could be divorced because they lost the fear of God they committed constant adultery constant backslidings and church remember their backslidings lasted years right Simon back said so much he built all those altars I'm sorry all those authors all those houses of worship for all the other gods it lasted years our backside you might last a day hopefully it's a day it might last a week a month hopefully not much Beyond a month or two but what I'm saying is that see we always come back to God hallelujah and church member even Peter baxton and wouldn't eat with the Gentiles right Paul said I die I do the things I hate he backsitted and did things he hated but they were still the Bride of Jesus Christ they were still forgiven they still had the Holy Ghost in their Souls praise God Amen they were just fighting awful mind battles so it says if we can just keep coming to God and get the victory over their mind battles well then surely God will prove to us that we are the Bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen like that's what brother Brook said what meant so much to him out there where God had to prove to Abraham that his word was true right right God had to prove it Abraham was laughing Sarah's laughing yeah right us us have a body change but God came to prove the word to them and God proved it was true God is going to do the same for us God's going to prove we're going to have a body change he has to because we don't have any ability of ourselves to believe the word of God faith is a gift rapturing faith is a gift everything is a gift and so God's going to prove his word to us and we will believe all of God's word hallelujah amen amen so this notice the difference here between a divorced woman and Esther Hallelujah this means Esther had to fear the lord this means Esther didn't backslide right inner soul I'll say like that we don't backsided our soul because our soul cannot sin praise God First John 3 verse 9. we're familiar with that one I've been laboring on that one Lately by God's grace now the second type is mordecai now Mordecai the Hebrew means little man so I'm not sure how the type works out there that's interesting it means little man so Esther had a little man not a big man a little man guiding her so I don't know if that means like a little still Small Voice I don't know I'm trying every Wham like all these last few days like how can I make this type does this work does that work I just come to the conclusion uh at this point I don't know maybe we'll get more Revelation as time goes on but Esther 2 verse five I'll read that here and now in shushan the palace there was a certain Jew whose name was Mordecai the little man the son of jair or the son of shimiah the son of Kisha Benjamin who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the Captivity which had been carried away with jeconiah king of Judah whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away and he brought up Hadassah that is Esther Esther means star his uncle's daughter for she had neither father nor mother and the maid was fair and beautiful who Mordecai when her father and mother were dead took for his own daughter interesting star the Bible says if we overcome we get the Morning Star right amen so there's something there's some connection there and I don't even know how to explain that what does that mean do I carry a star around in my pocket or what how do I get the Morning Star I would just say I just maybe Shine Like Jesus maybe maybe my glorified body shines like a star just like Jesus I don't know but if he wants to give me hidden Mana a star I'll take all that I'll take off I must have pockets in my glorified body or something like that I can put it here I'll eat that and it must refresh every day I'm not sure but if Jesus Promised it I believe I'll get it praise God now no notice Mordecai brought up Esther and then he directed her to Christ right and remember Mordecai isn't the bride but he's related to her now in the other the brother types Mordecai to brother Branham which could be uh brother Ram's message you know and brother man was a little man gotta open it up here I don't know there might be some overlap too but you know if you look at the type though that means brother random wasn't in the bride so that doesn't seem to work there and then brother random after uh all the Jews were saved then brother Brown becomes second in command in heaven and I don't know there's 24 elders I'm not a brother by worshiper so you know I'm I'm not gonna side with that one I know John the Baptist was the greatest in the old judgment though but I'm not quite sure how to type that out so you see how you see when you start really thinking about the types now this was a real shouting sermon there in July which there's a lot of beautiful types in there for some of them I think they're shouting without understanding and that's okay I do the same thing sometimes I shout at things and actually I never really thought about that too far so I just want to preach through through this again here and then you know even for me I have to change my type because here I believe Mordecai is the Old Testament law but how does the law become second in command in heaven right so then so then you know later I changed Mordecai Mordecai would be the 144 000 because they're not the bride but they're servants to the bride so I you know I've got to change my types because I can't see how the type works here does everybody understand yes so it's a little bit difficult to type another one is the brother type you know when when uh when Esther came in uh to the king because uh the Jews were gonna die you know the King extended his scepter and the brother who typed the scepter to Jesus Christ well isn't the King Jesus Christ you know so how can that work you know it's just there's just some types that just don't seem to fit praise God okay but uh Mordecai directed Esther to Christ and the Bible says that the scriptures direct us to Christ eternal life right amen from a child Timothy knew the scriptures that which were able to make him wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus now I don't know all of you had it but we ought to be thankful we had a Godly mother father that was pointing us to the word of God right even like my mom you know she wasn't really uh maybe heavy on teaching us to work but at least she took us to church I thank God for that right um because it was I was able to at least memorize John 3 16. that might have been the only one I memorized but now we got Revelation 10 7 Luke 17 30 memorized and all these good scriptures praise God hallelujah my mom also help me remember I memorize second Timothy 1 verse 7. for God has not given us a spirit of fear but a power of love and a sound mind Hallelujah and so Mordecai here points Esther to Christ and the uh once Israel is put away now Christ could find a people for his namesake to be his new bride Mordecai Esther's cousin urges her to enter the contest to become Xerxes new wife Mordecai the Elder a staunch Jew again types the holy law of Moses as a school Master to point us to Christ I've also thought maybe Mordecai represented Saint Paul and Saint Paul was pointing the bride to Christ I don't know but the Bible says wherefore the law was our school Master to bring us unto Christ that we might be justified by faith Hallelujah and remember John calls Jesus the increasing bridegroom right now that's a thought we want to keep in mind right John the Baptist said I must decrease I must die so that Jesus may increase amen we see the same in brother Adams Ministry God has allowed him to decrease he's passed off the scene so our our focus should be on Jesus amen right but we can't understand Jesus message without the prophet Jesus sent right right so we have to look at the scripture brother and pointing us to Hallelujah that's why when they send anointed ones at the end times that's why we listen to those sermons because program this ministry points us to the Bible like well Ram was the one that pointed out the tares are bound first I never heard that in denomination I never heard that at the chapel they had no idea about that Parable but we have a great idea about it praise God why because the Mysteries are given to us hallelujah because we are the children of the of God hallelujah John said he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom was standeth in here then rejoices greatly because the bridegroom's voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled he must increase but I must decrease and I've heard preachers say it too church I believe a program came to our church he would be so happy in our church because he's seeing people live out the message that he preached amen I believe he'd be happy at a master churches that at least I listen to online as well because the people aren't worshiping brother Branham they're pointing the people to Jesus Christ they're having Youth meetings to get people filled with the Holy Ghost amen amen they're having worship services to worship and exalt Jesus Christ Hallelujah they're making videos to teach people the message of the hour praise God said teaching he said lays your foundation Hallelujah it put your roots down Hallelujah in other words you can't be shaken because God's revealed your position to you already amen amen and brother random said it's Jesus behind the Bible Ministry brother answer the fivefold ministers are God's dress wear so when God when Jesus wants to speak to you he comes and anoints the pastor and he stands behind the veil of the pastor and preaches to you like they say the pastor is the voice behind the voice you have to listen for Jesus voice behind my voice same thing for the Evangelist same thing for the Apostle right the teacher Hallelujah all the fivefold ministry the prophet Minor Prophets only now but you got to look for Jesus voice behind the dress where behind the veil look behind the skins look behind the badger skins Hallelujah and listen to the voice of God hear God's voice it's Jesus talking to us is Jesus increasing today praise God Amen like I told you that one Pastor from Florida he had two witnesses a message pastor and a Catholic woman said witches are in your church trying to get you to play tapes and he found it to be right because witchcraft is the sin of rebellion against the word of God that was back in 2016. so think about how they've Advanced yeah but I thought I would tell you that no wonder I've been blasting that all these years no wonder praise God I go around and he didn't realize why was I blessed in denomination why was I blasting it and then the Holy Spirit showed him if the Deeds of nickelators it's the doctrine of Balaam Hallelujah it's it's uh it's the Jezebel religion he said all these years he said Ed it's going to come into the mark of the beast praise God he said no wonder I've lasted all those years because it will be the mark of the beast no wonder see God's spirit always guides Us in the right path Hallelujah Amen in other words if you're growing in Grace and now is your lord you won't be too far off the beaten path you'll be right down the middle of the road praise God amen amen so Jesus is the bridegroom but he's got a bride Hallelujah and when there have been much disputing Peter rose up and some of them men and Brethren you know how that a good while ago God made Choice Among Us that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel and believe and God which knoweth the hearts better than witness giving them the Holy Ghost even as he did unto us sending hath declared how God at first did visit the Gentiles to take out of them a people for his name isn't that beautiful when I got married I said I want Kristen to be a Smith I want her to be a Smith with me I took her for my name praise God it's a lot shorter than hesterman too it's a pretty I mean estherman's pretty good name but I wanted to take her for my day I want her to be associated with me same thing Jesus did for us praise God Amen he wants us to be associated with the true Gospel of Jesus Christ Hallelujah with his name the name of Jesus praise God not fathers but holy ghost but the name of Jesus the name of of all names praise God he took us out for his name now their type is Esther's virginity this means you're justified by faith because foolish virgins are saved as well let me get your Bible go to uh Matthew 25 I don't have this one written down but I want to review it just so uh maybe the newcomers here can see it Matthew 25 in the parable of uh the great white Throne judgment Jesus Calls the foolish virgin they were predestinated and foreknown before the foundation of the world too Hallelujah think about that any person who's saved God has a place for them in his future Kingdom now they're not born again so they won't have a part in Jesus's spiritual Kingdom right now right they won't have a part in it right now because the kingdom of God is within you now but they'll have a part in the future home right that Kingdom that's right Matthew 25. okay let's read 31. when the son of man shall come in his glory all the Holy Angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne in his glory or Throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth and sheep from the goats and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on his left think about that Donald Trump Joe Biden zielinski Putin they'll all be gathered there and they're either on one side or the other right right but we'll be seated with Christ amen because do you not know that Saints shall judge the Earth but they'll all be standing there I'll be looking up to Jesus right now we're all looking up to them they're the great one they got all the power they only have power of God allows in their power that's right and God can tear them down and raise up somebody else but all nations will be standing there and Jesus Will separate sheep on my sheep on my right hand and goats on the left hand verse 33 and he shall set the sheep on his right hand and go to the left here it is then shall the king say to them on the right hand Come Ye blessed on my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world this is the white Throne judgment so only thing that's left right is casting all the the devils and the sinners in the Lake of Fire and then the future home but he tells these that that get saved and they're surprised to me say think about that they're surprised to be saved he says I prepared it from the foundation of the world Hallelujah that beautiful God's got two sections of his book right he's got a Lamb's Book and he's got a book of life yes we know in the Lamb's Book of Life we're so we're so special you know we're beloved Hallelujah but also the ones that remain in the Book of Life they're special to God too they believed in God too they got a place in heaven too praise God hallelujah that's why we never want to belittle anyone that's not in the message people ask me this week numerous times can someone get the Holy Ghost in the nomination well I said only if there's like I think I might do this too only if there's an exception like some of some exception but generally the Bible says they they've got to hear a holy ghost Bill preacher to get the Holy Ghost like Acts chapter 19. right now there's some people uh not a part of our church that say they got the holy ghost out of denomination well maybe I don't know maybe it's possible but for me I gotta stay with the Bible praise God yeah the Bible says you get the Holy Ghost when another person with the Holy Ghost preaches the word of God to you praise God that's just my opinion and at least I got some Bible to back it up but there could be some exceptions who's going to see that uh and then they're they're surprised they're surprised in verse 37. eventually the righteous answer Lord when saw we the hungered and fed thee or thirsty and gave the drink the winds all we could be a stranger and took the in or naked and clothing or when saw we these sick or in prison and came to see thee and the Kings shall answer and saying to them Veritas in you ends as much as you have done it it's unto one of the least of these my brother and you've done it unto me praise God so these people didn't even know when they visited brother Jess or when they visited brother amen in the hospital right or whatever they didn't even know we're like brother Levi in prison they didn't even know when they were visiting that they didn't know I'm visiting a portion of the body of Christ and they realize like your parents maybe brother I don't know we'll just trust God for his Mercy I don't know they didn't even know wow this person is a part of Christ yeah yeah they're part of the spiritual body of Jesus Christ and like you've heard said I don't care if I'm the pinky I don't care if I'm the knee I just want to be a part of that body praise God and then every serpent is under my feet praise God hallelujah even if I'm the skin on the bottom of the feet Hallelujah I'm still far and I believe I believe I'm the lowest of those but I'm still part of Christ how do I know because I believe God's word amen I live God's word I'm not perfect but the reality is no man is perfect that's right but I want to grow in Grace I want to be diligent I want to be faithful as the Bible says I want to be all these things the Bible tells us to be so I believe Esther's virginity and I think we already read it there in Esther chapter two yeah so this this virginity types out you're saved right God's not there's no condemnation Hallelujah to the believer right there can't be because Jesus just said it right here if ever he's going to judge him it's right here and he says I I I've saved you I've already prepared the kingdom of the world the kingdom of the Future King is for you I've already saved you there's no sins all the charges have been dropped Hallelujah amen see when we got saved Saints when we got saved we're versions of the word amen hallelujah and this is the power of the blood of Jesus Christ think about this church again God set for Jesus to be a perpetuation a wrath taker through faith in his blood the Wrath that we are or do is already been paid for Jesus can't send me to hell because Jesus already went to hell for me he already paid the punishment for my sins so I got nothing to worry about praise God I can be anxious for nothing but as the Bible says but when everything be be prayerful and thankful with Thanksgiving in my heart making singing making melody in my heart with joy to the Lord praise God Hallelujah because I have faith I Believe In The Blood thank you Jesus for the blood of life I've just seen that after service amen he says because Jesus declared his Holiness his righteous for the sending away of my sins and your sins through the grace of God isn't that you know let's be honest what's the often most battle Satan fights us with every every week you're not worthy right you didn't do enough this week you weren't good enough this week all those sins have already been paid for devil right amen they've already been paid for the fact is I'm still standing praise God Amen the fact is I'm obeying God's word by coming to church today amen right right and that's that's often what we're gonna battle oh well yeah you're going to church but you're just not good enough I wasn't saved by my goodness praise God I'm not going to be raptured by my goodness Hallelujah let me raptured because I've got the Holy Ghost praise God because he gave me the gift of the Holy Ghost because I kept marching all the way to the ark took me in back over Jordan and I'm in the promised land praise God Amen I just followed Joshua I just followed Jesus amen and the Ark opened up the way I just believe God's word hallelujah amen amen so see she had to be she was required to be virgin that's what the blood of Jesus Christ makes us makes us virgin to the word so The Virginity types complete Devotion to Christ with no worldly intercourse right now what's amazing not one evil word is recorded about Esther's character amen who shall lay any charge to the account of the Bride of Jesus Christ amen it's God that justifies his people thank God Amen nobody can lay an account to your charge praise God Amen nobody can do it because that's what the blood did it was a substitute for all your sins and you get all his righteousness praise God Amen it's a gift a gift of Grace and now look remember this scripture this is a church that at one time was so backsplitted they were they were okay with a man sleeping with his stepmom they didn't even mourn over everybody knew the sin was in the church but nobody said nothing about it right they were okay with that they were they were they had people in the church Ali that were going to take someone else to the core and sue them imagine that Emma's gonna Sue Ally or Lydia is going to sue her dad please you're sitting right there in the church and yet he tells them when you got saved he says I espoused you I engaged you as a chaste Virgin of Christ hallelujah look at that see when you get saved your version of Christ now I don't we don't know all the details but the Bible said uh in The Exodus a mixed multitude came out so that in that in this church they might have had a mix of altitude some people might have believed Paul's message but not really believe in it right they might have come out they might come to church but they're not living it God help us to live the word of God Amen right Paul was jealous why are all these simple things happen when I when you got saved when you got baptized you were a chaste Virgin of Christ now Chase means totally pure is that awesome the blood makes us totally pure praise God in other words your past is away Satan can't bring up your past it's been paid for praise God Amen Hallelujah and all I got is a bright future brother awesome praise God because my past has been forgotten praise God all you have to live for is a great present and a great future right but my past sinful life has been put away praise God hallelujah amen and he sees me as pure like I've never done anything in the first place Glory praise God it's as if as though I never did it in the verse boys I know I did it but it wasn't the soul praise God now this is a new type I had thought a thought out here Esther as an orphan represents the Gentiles with no Covenant she had no father mother right she had no headship and what the Bible say about the Gentiles we are without Christ he's the real head right and Melchizedek had no father mother because Melchizedek was God right so Christ is God we are without Christ we were aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel right and Esther was out of Israel that's interesting type there too and strangers from the covenants of Promise having no hope and without God in the world so Esther was basically an orphan but somebody took her in no it could be the Old Testament law I even thought about it just could be the holy spirit for justification it could be that so these men could represent stages of Grace So Mordecai might represent justification haggai might represent sanctification so I'm not sure but the main thing is to see the story but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh unto the blood of Christ so Esther had no hope no parents but now she's brought nigh to the king oh my God Amen oh my and George whether she was received or not she was gonna have all her needs taken care of the rest of her life church all of our needs to be taken care of by Jesus Christ even your foolish person praise God right your sins are done away with praise God yes your faith has got to be tested it's got to be tried but everything's gonna be taken care of God he's already called you into Heavenly places praise God he's already got a name he's got he got your name on The Book of Life in heaven he's already got a portion for you in the Kingdom of Heaven praise God Amen he foreknew you would come he foreknew you'd be virgin to the word and you've already got a place you're seated amongst royalty brother hallelujah amen this one this royalty in that Palace and that's where we are we're seated in the Heavenly places with the royalty of Heaven hallelujah amen amen you don't think that you don't think you're sitting with some royalty around here aren't you Kings Embrace unto God right amen Hallelujah you don't think there's a great reward for Beatrice leaving the denomination coming the message dedicating your whole life to the message these last 40 some years you don't think there's a great reward for 40 years of service I would say there's a great reward amen don't you think so Hallelujah there's got to be some royalty around here somewhere this is right we're sending the most heavily royalty here by God's grace Hallelujah she was taken in now she's got a covenant Hallelujah now she's got a future why because she's virgin and she's beautiful amen your version by justification you're beautiful because character's beautiful character that's what God's looking for character now I'm gonna let's go to chapter two verse eight you got your Bible there this is the one I kind of want to Major on here by God's grace thank you all right um Esther 2 verse 8. no it's all came to pass when the king's commandment and his decree Was Heard and when many maidens were gathered together under shoeshine the palace to the custody of hagian that Esther was brought also onto the King's house to the custody of haggai Keeper of the women and the Maiden pleased him and she obtained kindness of him and he speedily gave her things for her purification with such things as belong to her and seven maidens which were meat to be given her out of the King's house and he prepared her and her Maids under the best place of the House of the women this is awesome immediately as she comes into the the the Royal Chambers she gets favor with haggai immediately right and of course we know this is sanctification now here's a new thought I never had this before but all these churches I just about to church this week that said come as you are I think it was right on this road right on here Turkey Foot Road let's see where we uh yeah took the road out there and it said come as you are right I thought oh that's a nice sign you know Come As You Are but if you apply that spiritually that's true Esther came as she was but she couldn't stay that way hallelujah it's true come as you are but now you're going to go through a purification process always come as you are but then you if you want to come before the king amen if you want time with the King amen if you want your turn church this is our turn this is our generation to be with the King praise God this is our turn we won't get another turn before this won't get one after this is our turn so we got to be purified to have a turn with Christ hallelujah amen amen so we can come we're virgin and thank God we're forgiven but we still got to be purified and the word sanctification means purification right amen [Music] all of our sins are forgiven God don't hold any of our past to us thank God Hallelujah nothing in my past gonna be late to me Hallelujah but he still needs me to be pure Hallelujah this is the great scripture where they say oh Esther put on makeup I beg to I beg your pardon where does the bible ever say paint in this verse the Bible doesn't say paint the Bible said Jezebel painted Israel painted uh and then Judah painted as there's three types two of them were Nations one of them was Jezebel the Bible never said Esther painted anything she might have paid in some beautiful landscaping scenes in her free time or something like that you sure that pain in her face yeah yeah but notice she pleased her she beats him he types sanctification now some people will type that as brother Brandon oh yeah I forgot to type in your notice what'd she get she got seven maidens now he may not understand you may not agree with me on this but I believe she had to have seven babies before she could go into the king pardon me seven helpers before she went into the king okay Hallelujah Why seven why why she needs seven before she goes into the King Jesus Hallelujah well she had to help her she couldn't do it alone praise God and church we can't do it alone we've got to have help to go in the presence of the king praise God Amen so I believe those sit on some people may say Seven Seals maybe could be but I believe it's those seven uh attributes of a stature perfect man seven helpers that will be right there to help her out how many know that Faith helps you out when you when you need when you need Faith amen when you invert you when you need some uh knowledge some patience it's right there to help you out isn't it amen hallelujah and I'll say like this it was given to you yes Glory so seven maidens were given to you and also wisdom is typed out as a woman in the scripture she has building her house so the attributes of the Holy Spirit are feminine in designation and so she's given seven maidens this is going to help you be accepted with the King Hallelujah that's a freshman that came yesterday by God's grace I I think it's fresh Hallelujah and notice she was preferred Above All The Virgins Esther gets the preference she gets uh she gets favor verse 10. Esther had not showed her people nor her Kindred for Mordecai I'd charge her that she should not show it now I don't really fully understand the Revelation behind this but as I said everybody thought Esther was a gentile everybody thought she was from shushan however you say that doesn't have to say wrong and to me that's a beautiful type of the Gentile Church right and us and so we can clearly see her lineage was a secret her DNA was a secret Hallelujah nobody knew where she really came from Hallelujah but she knew where she come from right even the devil the devil didn't really know where she come from until the time of the rapture Hallelujah I like that verse 11 and Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house to know how Esther did and what should become of her so again if you talk to his brother random how does brother random check every day before she's born again I don't know see that's why to me it looks like maybe the Holy Spirit or the first work of Grace or something I don't know some of these types are hard to see now verse 12 is what we're going to get to now in every Mage turn was come to go into King Azure after that she had been 12 months according to the manner of women for so were the days of our purifications accomplished two at six months oil myrrh and six months with sweet odors and with other things for the purifying of women okay anybody see any makeup in there no any Max Factor in there did I miss Max Factor in there what's the Maybelline maybe it's Maybelline is that what they call it that really dates me back in the 80s but this is sanctification she's already Justified she's already virgin of the word thank God Hallelujah but you got to be purified Hallelujah there's no makeup here but I like how there's oil Hallelujah and oil represents the Holy Spirit praise God hallelujah and sweet odors of the Bible say our prayers and our worship is like sweet odors to God amen the Bible says that when you say praise the Lord think about that sister sir you know when you just say praise the Lord when you're driving home or praise the Lord that's a sweet odor going up before God right right and this is what's given to her oh she's taught how to pray brother she's taught how to worship she's taught how to praise God and she she gets it poured in there notice it's a whole year a whole year the Bible calls that a time time and times and times and Seasons so she gets a whole year of sanctification now mine lasted longer than one year but you understand the time Hallelujah also this meant I like this the brother brought this up also 12 months meant it proved she had no other man's seed right could have she'd have known another man it would have manifested by there by that time so I love it this this woman she has no other life except the King's life praise God Amen that's what we got in the soul praise God the Bible said we're sealed to the king we're sealed to his sea unto the day of our Redemption no other life just eternal life the life of Christ hallelujah amen amen thank God Hallelujah for sealing your love into me praise God Amen in other words thank you Lord for protecting the womb of my soul hallelujah amen until the Holy Ghost could come and seal it hallelujah amen that's good I like that my name is yeah sanctify means to purify so to me that's a beautiful type of Esther having to go through sanctification Hallelujah so oil is the Holy Ghost in sanctification odors prayers worship before God and church doesn't that purify you who feels more pure when you leave out of church and you've danced or you've shouted or you've cried or you've begged God at the altar or you worship who feels more pure right here so did Esther that's the sweet owners you were given sweet or odors you're given a way to worship God and it purifies you right right man we prayed on Wednesday night for anointing remember that I left Wednesday Thursday I drove the I took Malachi I felt the anointing all day I'm driving I'm getting all these thoughts I'm like talking to my phone and sharing these thoughts I'm like and I got there I Malachi members I just thought man there's so much to preach I can't it's just it was just flow it's like an open Channel praise God and then when I got there the people heard it they received it and they're like this is what we wanted this is what we were wondering about this is what we prayed for that's exactly what we needed so see that that prayer on Wednesday guided my anointing for Thursday amen hallelujah and your prayers yesterday help out with anointing today hallelujah or if we need more anointing let's pray for it at the conclusion of this and let's take the anointing into second service then let's take it into Monday and let's take it into the school year little girls let's take it in the school year praise God whether public or home you can have the anointing on you praise God for a good school year Ali's gonna be a senior this year can I just be a senior this year but also I want to tell Alan Emmy that and uh um Lydia Malachi you know I'm so proud of you guys because you're serving God I never serve God until I was a freshman in college you guys I've seen you dance and praise God shout and scream praise the Lord worship get the Holy Ghost I love it serving God at the piano I love that you guys have served God from a young age yeah and if you stay with God God will bless you beyond what you could think amen I look at my life my wonderful wife eight children when I I've got the health we got we just got everything we have Meetup we never missed one meal and I just can't amend I couldn't imagine God would be so good to me praise God and so remember there's rewards coming for you you stay faithful to Christ put him first there's great rewards coming for you God will not be mocked right whatever a man sows that's what a reap if you give the best of your best years of your life for Christ you will have a great future I'm telling you that's right give the best of your years to Jesus Christ praise God Amen God will give you friends like amen and Austin they're my friends all these wonderful sisters in the church all my brothers got to give you a real family of God yes Hallelujah as Esther wins the beauty contest did you see people say they're not you sisters don't think you're beautiful you won the beauty contest you're the brother you want it he liked you more than everybody else amen yeah no I'll read this I'll go back a little bit but notice Esther only a Adorn adorned herself with haggy eyes requirements and nothing more now we've heard this preach many times but just bear with me hege I was a king's Chamberlain and The Keeper of the women and type sanctification the second work of Grace and see we don't need anything from the world added to our walk with God now for us it's going to be um you know worldly music we don't need that we don't need makeup we don't need high heels right for a Temptation for men is we don't need big muscles you don't have to have big muscles to get the Holy Ghost right you don't have to have it so you're just Temptations you don't have to have a Mercedes-Benz now okay you have to go to college you get a four-year degree to know you God loves you you don't do that that's not part of sanctification right it's whatever the Holy Ghost requires and God's requirement is in the word of God praise God Amen amen nothing nothing added to it like I made a video I had uh is there a good text to me yesterday and I sent her the video I made a video about getting the Holy Ghost and you just it's very simple all you do is daily pray and Obey that's all you got it I'm sorry daily read pray and Obey just I made up a little rhyme it's that simple to get the Holy Ghost because the Bible says seek me first every day right right so daily read your Bible pray and Obey that's all I gotta do yes yes whoever hungers and thirsts at the Rises shall be filled praise God I even told zero I said brother brother amen knew the season of his holy ghost falling I didn't he knew it was coming and he said I'm not leaving the church so it's coming up that's Faith right there yes I was just married I was so happy I got my woman after my name aren't you Gladys Smith I didn't even know it was coming that day but that service was anointed the music and the preachings shouting you you know what the Holy Ghost is there praise God yes right I stood up and I saw that Vision I shouted I screamed I cried and I walked out there I was a new person I was full of the love of God Amen right I knew it no did that love leave in my mind yes I had to renew it yeah but I knew something happened there and the devil couldn't take that away from me that's right he still can't take it away from me [Music] praise God so notice Esther lived by every word of haggai the second work of Grace in preparation for her marriage that's an hour already my goodness are you kidding me um I'd already read that one at the bottom and there's another application that she had to endure the test of time God wants to see that you'll sit through the entire time of purification and just take what he likes yes right like we like we looked at music you know I could use that it doesn't whatever I like it has to be what God likes if not I need to get get rid of what I like yes that's right that's right amen amen and church when I got the Holy Ghost I got rid of all my rock and roll like I told you I made a few mistakes I'll download a few songs I shouldn't have downloaded so I deleted them last week Ali disco and I hardly ever listen to him like I was telling brother amen I just make mistakes I got the Holy Ghost by just doing what Jesus liked right right but then when I make mistakes I got to go back thank God there's still purification hallelujah thank God but we all got to go through the test of time we ought to go through that purification time and just remember I've got favor remember she was treated better than everybody else during sanctification that's right yeah she was given all the secrets of the word of God this is what God likes God doesn't like this God don't like denominational ideas you don't like Creeds and bylaws he just likes this Bible right here [Music] that's how you get the Holy Ghost Bible a read uh pray obey sorry it's been a couple years since I made that video forgot that no that's important to see that by God's grace that this is what purification is it's oil it's sweet odors and there it is sweet orders prayers pray worship God Hallelujah give God the glory all right now these are scriptures on sanctification you're Sanctified by what you're Washed by the spirit of God so just take picture in your mind God just washed me over these this time until I get the Holy Ghost I'm just being washed this whole time I'm getting cleaner all the time amen every service I'm getting cleaner even every service I'm getting closer to God hallelujah amen like I said have prayer meeting that's what I have prayer meetings in your own house with just you and God just to invite God to a prayer meeting yes that's right I was expecting angels to come never seen them but I know there's an angel that surrounds us right amen you fear God there's an angel there amen right invite God to the prayer meeting Hallelujah God wants us to be Sanctified holy or completely and God has chosen us he's chosen us to be saved because we want to be purified through sanctification through purification of the spirit and belief for the truth that's why God chose you he knew you let him sanctify you and he knew you wouldn't believe fathers and holy ghost or three persons yeah or Ebay to Apple or you can marry and divorce as many times as you want he knew you'd believe the truth that's why he chose you praise God Hallelujah remember all those other Christians Christians are going to unite with the Pope right who's the most wicked of all that's right that's why they get deceived they get deceived because they love unrighteous he lets them keep sinning he lets them live a worldly life but heck yeah I don't let you do that hanging out it tells you the secrets here's how you please Xerxes here's how you please the king just do what I tell you to do praise God amen amen now the wedding day is Esther 2 16-17 and we read that for our text that's the wedding day yes now yeah I just want to read verse 14 at the bottom of the Bible said she came in unto the king no more except the king delighted her and that she was called by name so teachers this proves if we're the bride of Christ he Delights in our prayers Jesus didn't put us away right we have been blasting the holy ghost or something like that we are part of the Bride he Delights in our worship he loves when we pray he loves when we come to church he loves to hear our voice in the morning praise God Amen he Delights in us that's what Psalm says God Delight remember Psalms 149 and 150 God Delights in the timbrel god Delights in the dance Hallelujah he Delights in the worship and this is why don't put us away because he Delights in our worship and we Delight to worship him praise God Amen amen we both have joy we both have Delight in the presence of Christ amen amen so the wedding night is the type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost I love this as soon as she started walking the in the courts everybody looked on her and had favor on her Hallelujah and that awesome God God says all the angels to give us favor praise God all the Heavenly Angels favor us they do Hallelujah they do they give us protection the Bible said they're ministering Spirits sent to The Heirs of Salvation praise God if you've ever been helped supernaturally that angel gave you favor amen that's right now no notice she went in uh she went into the king in verse 16 on the 10th day of the seventh year that sounds familiar so the brother used that 10-7 as Revelation 10 7. now I'll go with you a little bit on that one because the mystery of God is finished right and what's one of the Mysteries it's Christ in you the hope of glory right so the baptism of the Holy Ghost is part of the mystery that's mentioned the Mysteries are all mentioned of course all the mysteries in Revelation 10 verse 7. but I personally believe it better fits to the damn atonement because the day of atonement took place on the 10th day of the seventh month Hallelujah and what's the day of atonement it was a day when all the sins of the nation were washed away right imagine that you can think of all all the sins from the past 365 days now let's not let the devil bring them all up but think of all the sins you've done the last three try to think about the number at least 365 right all those sins but you can come to that church service and if you stayed all the way and if you believe you could walk on that church service and know everything's forgiven I have a clean slate I'm walking fresh praise God and that's what the baptism of the Holy Ghost is for your soul your soul never stand in the birthplace all the sins are gone all the unbelief is gone and now you're just forgiven and now your slate is clean Hallelujah now you have the life of God and there's no charges against you praise God Amen Hallelujah that makes me happy thank you Jesus wherefore my brethren you also become dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who's raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God all right now Esther's wedding night types the Christians Born Again experience First Peter 1 23 being born again not a corruptible seed but of the encryptal by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever Hallelujah so again we see New Birth seed see Born Again New Birth C so a wedding night receive seed that's where we get that the baptism of the Holy Ghost also a Song of Solomon Solomon went to the shulamite for the wedding night in chapter 4 verse 16 and chapter 5 verse 1. he said he went into my garden and wasn't Eva Garden right every woman's a garden right so it goes into the garden you can see the uh the type there now ask her secret identity I already went through this already but Christians are the spiritual Jews and the soul now this is not replacement Theory just so you know there's a lot of churches not in the message but denominations that say that they understand Israel's divorce but they think God is not going to bring her back and so they they actually teach we are the spiritual Israel and the natural Israel is not coming back now that's the sin to do that that's wrong to do that all you got to do is read Romans chapter 11 right that's all you got to do and listen to the fifth seal if they just did that they would know God is going to bring her back God's going to graft her back in it yes God's going to take off the blinders God's gonna take out the blindfold and she's going to see that Jesus they got to read Zechariah 2 amen that the nation reborn in one day a fountain will be opened in the House of David hallelujah amen amen so just just say no church we are not replacement theology we're a replacement Theory we are the Gentile bride right not the Old Testament bride where the Gentile and New Testament bride and that's because of Romans 2 29 the Bible said we're spiritual Jews we have the circumcision not necessarily the flesh but it's a circumcision of the Soul the soul right the spirit the Bible says all right so that's your secret identity right everybody thought she's Gentile Gentile everybody says we're Gentile right we know we're Gentile but really we're spiritual Jews because we have the circumcision of the Soul all right although she was Jewish her Israeli identity was at first unknown to the king and all shushan in other words everyone considered her a virgin Gentile Esther never even lived a day in Jerusalem these facts about Esther type today's spiritual virgin the bride Church he's Jew and Gentile but inwardly she's a spiritual Jew her heart has been circumcised by the Holy Ghost now see let me just stop there remember circumcision is a permanent surgery right that's why I was telling a brother uh Thursday night at the meeting I said you can be permanently done with this sin that you're battling because that's what circumcision is like I'm permanently done with the filthy magazines and movies permanently done with chewing tobacco and smoking permanently right right and I don't really want to name this apparently done with the sports idolatry see there's got to be a circumcision so you stay with Christ right you stay faithful like Joshua you stay faithful to the ark and pretty soon you'll cross over Jordan and there'll be a circumcision ceremony praise God but in Joshua represents the one the same thing praise God Amen you crossed over you're circumcised these habits gonna race and I told the brother I said you got Authority by the word of God to say Satan I cast you out and you can never enter again praise God amen amen that's exactly right praise God we have that Authority that's the word of God amen amen Hallelujah that's a great scripture to use you have that Authority and you just wait for God's timing to use it praise God or like whatever answer or you can use it until it happens brother I said even if you don't feel your healing just say I'm Healed until the Revelation comes right amen right it's better to be positive than negative right right better be positive than wondering and scared or you know nervous right that's right it's a good idea and amen now there's some unknown types like Mordecai Saves The King's life so how did the Old Testament law say Jesus life during the church ages yes there are some types that I just don't know how to type them out the other side is how did Brothers save Jesus life if Mordecai saved the King's life how did Brother Adam say Jesus life and brother Adams indictment sermon he said Jesus was crucified afresh so see it's interesting like how do you type this out I don't know I'm just telling you I can only type certain things Mordecai refused about a Haman and that lead to led to the decree to kill all the Jews so maybe this is the Jew that you send representing the Polish virgins but also the virgins inside the reversion inside the palace that represent the foolish virgins as they are not Esther the bride so again I don't know I don't know how all these types of the story work Mordecai and the Jews fasted and mourned and it moves as sort of fast and pray for three days now Church the way I can see this this could be you know the Bible said all nations are going to come against Israel at the end time how many know that right right and during the tribulation all the armies will actually gather I appreciate it months ago right and showed you in Ezekiel 38 and 39 how all the nations are going to come against Israel so this this could mean before the rapture we start seeing the Jews even more uh attacked or abused and so we'd have to intercede for them we have to pray for them right it could mean that but I've always I've always used it you know before the rapture we got to have more fasting and praying that's what I'm saying that's right we gotta have some fasting and pray right because that that's what the Bible said uh in Isaiah 58 that's what brings healthier about you want to get healthy fast amen you want to be a blessing to somebody fast skip a meal go go serve somebody all right go do something for somebody else and God will bless you Hallelujah uh in some cases you want to be healed gotta pass yeah yeah right if we want to see somebody else here we gotta fast for them that's right and of course remember there's a lot of incomplete ties like Joseph 30 pieces uh and uh Jesus was sold out I'm sorry Jesus was sold out for 30 pieces Joseph was 20 pieces I got a typho there and then Sodom was remembered was destroyed before Isaac's birth or before the rapture so there's some unknown types in here okay now heyman's plot of laying down the physical mark of the beast this is the type of the USA BEAST's decree to kill all who don't receive the mark of the beast now to me this is a very beautiful type I'm going to read this out of uh Revelation 13. let's remember this Revelation 13 16-17 now since we're Revelation 13 let me show you this verse just see how people can misinterpret oh yeah go to Revelation 13 3 and I saw one of the heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wandered after the Beast now this is Imperial Rome turning into papal Rome around 500 500 A.D but this verse was used by a famous preacher not the message to say that Satan can heal because the wound of the Beast was healed I said no sir so you gotta need to go read Matthew chapter 12. I'll teach it to the kids here tonight and it'll be a good review for the adults Jesus said Satan cannot cast out Satan The Impossible Satan cannot heal I'll unlock some of the secrets here tonight my guys Grace wink wink there's some really good scriptures I never knew I preached him on Thursday night Malik I was there there's some scriptures I've never really seen before but go down to verse 16 now 16 brother man uses verse to say the bride will be forced to stop preaching before the rapture that was in pick up your pen and write from spoken word Original Seed 1962. I know it's a little bit of review but thank you for bear with me verse 16. and he causes all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or their foreheads so that's everybody right and you saw how bind Administration is moving towards electronic currency right saw that that's picking up steam they got to be able to wait to shut down all your money think about that you we wouldn't be able to go to the store and buy something they wouldn't take our cards wouldn't take our cash that's really something we don't know how it's going to work out right we know the mark of the beast is actually a spiritual Mark first when someone turns out the Holy Ghost it's called the reprobate mind but then it's begun to come into a natural Mark as well yes or you can take the mark of his name or the number of his name there's different ways to take the mark of the beast that's in the book I wrote there's different ways to take a mark of the piece just going along with the Beast and not speaking against it that's taking the mark of the beast right there's lots of there's there's I think three different ways to take the mark of the beast according to the scripture verse 17 and that no man might not by herself say that he had the mark yeah here's the mark the Mark or the name the Pope or the number 666 because that day instead of the son of God so there's three three different ways they can take the mark of the beast here's wisdom let him that have to understand and count the number of the Beast for it is the number of a man and his number is 603 score and six right it's a vicarious Philly I die I can never say it the right way but maybe one day I'll get that right but it's a number that adds up to the Pope the instead of the Son of God in the place of the Son of God it's the Pope's uh title the Vicar of Christ there is the Vicar of Christ he's called the Vicar of Christ and he's in place of Christ okay so we can clearly see uh the Gentile bride will come to a time where she could be killed for what she believes she can be killed for her Heritage amen for her DNA praise God hallelujah our spiritual DNA is the Lord Jesus Christ amen heyman's bought to kill the Jews including Mordecai Esther types the very end of the times of the Gentiles this is when the beasts of the Earth in Revelation 13 plaster kill both small and great rich and poor abandon free who do not take his Antichrist mark now his theme remember the theme of the Antichrist is peace and safety what do we have in a lot of cities today that are liberal a lot of crime right New York uh Cleveland is one of the worst places to be that's one of the highest murder rates I think it's in the top five in the nation Cleveland it's just 40 40 minutes north of us since all this uh coveted stuff happened and the Democratic leaders that don't go to Cleveland but I mean you go to Cleveland just pray before you go I want to be hanging around there in the wrong wrong uh alleys at night time don't go there night time but what's he gonna say I'm gonna give you peace I'm Gonna Give You safety while outlawing true Christianity insulting unionized I'm sorry and instituting unionized religion just as haman's plot was spoiled by Esther's prayerful humble intercessions so will the Beast plot be foiled by the bride Church's prayers a church and brother Branham said the Rapture will be an easy thing if Enoch walked off this Earth under the blood of bulls and goats if Elijah jumped on a chair brother amen right and the elect cannot be deceived I believe will be fully ready for the Rapture it won't be a hard thing I believe even easy thing praise God now we don't know what we'll endure during the squeeze but look at this we know it's going to happen they're going to Outlaw our form of Christianity they're going to stop us from preaching yeah we will know the time and season I believe that squeeze will push us into rapturing Faith praise God Amen we have so many details Glory brother Rams are the seven CEOs from Genesis to Revelation now let me just explain that in other words we can look at Esther and we can see the seventh seal the day and hour of the rapture we can see the squeeze we can see the coming Lord in Enon praise God we can see it there in Genesis praise God we get all these little Clues Glory we get it in Daniel with the three Hebrew children music might be involved right right right that is such an amazing statement brother and me the seventh seal the coming Lord is from Genesis to revelation we're given so many Clues we cannot be deceived by Satan hallelujah praise God though he gets more deceptive we get more truth praise God Hallelujah I feel like it just gets unfolded more and more clearly every year we're in this thing because now we know it's not Russia that's going to be the Rapture right last year last year the preachers thought oh it's Russia and Ukraine war that's the sign of the rapture no other man was still right yeah right Hallelujah they had no quote for that they had a quote they misunderstood but they didn't have the quotes like we got quotes right no no I love those Brothers I believe they're filled with Holy Ghost I believe they're saved I believe they're called The Rapture I believe they're Zealand ain't up their wisdom just like mine sometimes sometimes my Zeal is up my wisdom and I look there wasn't a lot of amens all that thank you thank you because you know it was true but you didn't want to feel embarrassed no one embarrass me Hallelujah he'll Outlaw true Christianity but look Satan's plot to put down the mark of the beast gets spoiled by Esther's prayerful humble intercession so will the Beast soul of the Pope's plot be foiled by the bride church amen praise God hallelujah see we're gonna have to and I love this we're going to have to go boldly before the king Hallelujah we have to like like the Bible said she fast and prayed she got on her most Royal garments in other words she was living really close to God Hallelujah the Bible says put you on the Lord Jesus Christ that you will not make uh you would not make uh something for the flesh you want to make opportunity for the flesh to sin what was it provision for the flesh thank you yes Hallelujah so we're giving all these Bible Clues we're giving all these types and shadows surely we'll be ready surely we'll see a praise God surely God will not leave his people without a witness Hallelujah he's given us so many witnesses down to these scriptures through these sermons Hallelujah so many all right I'm almost done let me see how long wow okay all right I'll go faster some of this is a lot of this is reviewed now notice Haman gets I also thought about this that was a good type when Haman became second in command that's a lot like how Satan had his power the prince of the air over this Earthly Kingdom right and he got he got the king's Ring he got he gets permission to do things did he not get permission to attack job right did he not right but he's got to be taken down and someone else has to get that permissions I don't know about that one I don't know the type there but remember God recommended job be tested you know why because God needed some Modern Day jokes to be encouraged now is their health God needed God need a joke lose his health to encourage us today when we get sick right or God forbid we should lose loved ones in accidents God forbid but God needed a job to go through that so we could overcome as well [Music] God said go ahead do it but don't touch his life the Bible said we're all given tests but we'll always be able to overcome every single one that we go through amen the Bible says the Bible says you can endure any tests because God won't give you a difficult test that you can't handle and then he says flee from idolatry in other words don't run into the Temptations don't put yourself in a bad situation run from Idols in your life man then right because that would be that would be a test that we pull ourselves into right that's exactly right we're gonna put Idols in our lives and we we give things too much attention or praise more than the Lord Jesus Christ we're all guilty but we all get forgiven by God's grace to test the bride the whole world Esther A.A says the king's Proclamation sealed with his ring is irreversible But First Corinthians 10 13 promises God won't give us something we can't handle why because God's love is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost it's a seal unto the day of your Redemption amen remember Church the whole purpose of this the whole purpose of [Applause] other kind Esther the whole purpose was so that Esther would realize she was called to be Bride for such a time as this the whole purpose of this is so a little virgin woman formerly an orphan formerly outside of the palace Hallelujah she would know her position she would go before the king and she'd find favor in the sight of the king hallelujah amen that's what it was all about so she would know she was called to serve God for this time and season that's always that's the whole point of that all that God was Never Scared all of my people are going to die I was never scared because he had a woman there he had a bride there who was chosen to overcome Glory praise God hallelujah oh it's a beautiful type that's their fasting is a type of us fasting in the squeeze perhaps and it closed us with Christ's righteousness kind of already going over that one she put on a royal apparel stood before the king it could have cost her life she's willing to die to save her people so here's where we see maybe the squeeze has some some aspect where we we might be close to death because Esther could have died right the law the law said you can't come at this time right the law said you can't come unless you're summoned now that's totally different from the New Testament because the Bible tells us to come boldly before the throne of grace yes amen right so see some of these types don't work so maybe that law was a type of legalism or maybe it was just a spirit of fear or something in other words Church in our darkest moments if God should allow us to live in dark moments we know we've only got one thing we can do seek God pray fast and cry out to our King praise God right cry out to our husband that's our only step there's life or death will stand with the truth life or death we're standing with Christ Hallelujah amen amen it's a beautiful type she knew she was ordained for this the people that go in the Rapture they're going to be born for that anybody can say I'm going to Rapture but let's see who lives to actually take the Rapture yes let's see who actually and then lives a Godly life all the way up to it right like I told you Joseph Coleman he told all his people that he he'd get the revelation of the Thunders and then that would be rapturing faith when I look at their church now it's all broken up it's proven to be wrong see let's wait let's live a Godly life let's Point people just to the Bible let's not add to the word let's not take from the word let's let's be a real queen for Christ and let's recognize that we're born for this time and season this has to be for us hallelujah oh it's beautiful this type's uh Esther going before the king types us prayerfully approaching Christ the Bible says we have access by faith into the grace wherein we stand okay I'm gonna skip that so Esther had political pressure right we have a squeeze coming on the political leaders in America will change the laws requiring all churches to join an evil ecumenical Union but we'll be kept from The Mark of the Beast the time was actually laid down will be kept from that because we've kept God's word and his patience now someone asked me on a text from South Carolina last night they said brother Jesse how can you prove uh Rome is behind all the world governments so I said I can't prove all of them um but I have a lot of Bible proof remember Daniel's Vision the feet were partly iron and partly clay right so that's the Antichrist spirit is in Rome and romance said it's Roman Catholicism and protestantism the Clay's Protestants so the satanic kingdom is standing on Catholics and Protestants right now think of that Satan is in the Catholics and Protestants that's his feet right now thankfully Jesus comes and smite that right right Armageddon The Rock The Stone comes the mountain smites it at the feet but right now the Antichrist spirit is standing by United Roman Catholicism and protestantism like I showed you and then I sent a brother I said did you realize the latest data on our Congressman in Washington DC 88 are Christians no I'm sorry maybe that no yeah 88 are Christians 59 are Protestant and then 29 are Catholics and I said well who is funding the war in Ukraine that's killed over half a million people already and that's just what they think they don't even know there's 3 000 men that are in hospitals they'll never fight again because they're so maimed who's responsible for those half million who funded this war America right and they all love the pope remember the pope came back in 2015. so there's proof right there there's some little proof that the the pope and the Catholic church is behind all of this okay now then you got to start studying who owns everything who owns all the banks we talk about that we gotta Dig Down they're probably Catholics right or some type of connection to the Catholic Church all right let me let me finish so the so Esther the king says what do you want Esther odia she said I want a banquet I want a wine banquet praise God and this types the former and latter rain Hallelujah and this will empower the bride to expose Satan in his cowardly plot and that's something these wine Banquets so us being with the King having wine amongst the king under the anointing of the Holy Ghost it will Empower us to finally expose Satan and notice at that second mango what is Satan do he tries to touch the bride now that might be a type of the squeeze too he actually lays a hold on her and once the king knew he walks back and says no you're not touching my wife isn't that something yeah so there might be some a little pressure the bride's got to go through she's in the grip of Haman but at the right time Jesus always comes it might be four days late but he's right on time hallelujah amen hallelujah and Jesus saves her right at the last moment isn't that beautiful you're familiar with that remember the scripture this is the rapture of scripture Paul quotes Isaiah 25 in First Corinthians 15. the mountains shall this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of bad things a feast of wines of the leaves of fat things full of marrow of wines of the leaves less or well refined and he will destroy in this mountain the face of the cover and cast over all people and the veil that is spread over all nations he will swallow of death and victory and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off the Earth the Lord hath spoken it praise God look at this all the pressure on the bride all the Mind battles all the trials that have been on you they'll all be taken away when death is swallowed up in Victory when Haman is swallowed up by the king's order hallelujah amen it's all taken away praise God but how do we get there we've got to have a feast of wine we got to get more into the holy spirit amen I don't even want to be more in the holy spirit amen more free to worship more freedom Hallelujah more worship of God more sweet owners Hallelujah more oil more wine Hallelujah see we've got to draw closer to God much more as we see that day approaching praise God yeah some of these I'm just going to skip over because I'm trying I've already been an hour and a half okay all right a musicians can come I'm going to just do a couple more things musician's gonna come let's stand here so those are the ones I prepared the other day and these are the ones I prepared here on a different document from yesterday Hallelujah I want to go back and read Esther 217. I just want to remind you this pastor 217. and the King loved Esther above all the women and she obtained grace and favor in a sight more than all the virgins so that he set the Royal Crown upon her head and major Queen instead of bashti just remember the Bible calls you beloved you are God's special beloved people that doesn't mean he's going to do whatever you want I'm sure it has you heirs didn't do everything but uh Esther wanted to do right but she had access to him we have access to Christ amen he's not gonna do everything we want but we know we can approach him with the right garments on in his righteousness right right in the Holy Spirit so don't forget that you have favor above others you're the top choice of the king you're chosen elected ordained Hallelujah oh yes the last one if you would go to you got your Bible I was going to Psalm 138 verse 2. I'm going to end with this here as you know Esther never mentions the name of Jehovah not even one time you've never just leave that up there just for a minute you never see Jehovah you never see God you never see Lord in there Yahweh is not in there Jehovah Adonai Lord nothing the name of God is missing and so some Scholars say well because God's name in there it's not in there well we're not going to use that book remember this is a gent a woman they thought was Gentile they become king I'm sorry become Queen and then she saves her people from from total death total annihilation now I want to read a couple reasons here there's a couple reasons her name may not be mentioned first Esther shows how God works behind the scenes right it doesn't record any Miracles we'd say no Supernatural like in the fire you know a fourth man in the fire or anything like that it just shows God working through common people behind the scenes isn't that what we are seriously aren't we a common people no don't don't say brother Jesse don't believe Americans I believe in miracles but this book in particular shows how God works through humble means of Believers right God does a miracle through their prayers right through their fasting God does miracles also it's possible God didn't mention uh his name because of the circumstances a lot of people believe Mordecai wrote this book and if he wrote it in Persia under Xerxes he would probably have to leave God's name out because of all the multiplicity of gods that were in Persia that might be one reason so he was trying to protect the people from any harm and then the another reason may be because uh we wanted to emphasize God's Providence right notice the Bible said if Esther remains silent in Esther 4 14 Deliverance would come through another way right but Esther was called for such a time as this in other words Mordecai is showing God is Sovereign God's going to save us one way or the other so it shows God's Providence God already knew they were going to be brought out Hallelujah now here's the last reason here's the reason I think so I'm closing with this you've been a good audience here the reason I think there's no mention of God's name is because the name of God is in Esther's character in other words we see the word living out in Esther in her character she has become the word we see the word in Esther's life and what does the Bible say the Bible says I'll worship toward thy Holy Temple and praise thy name for thy loving kindness and for thy Truth for thou Hast magnified Thy word above all thy name now don't misunderstand this we always use the name of Jesus right but it's clear God if anyone looks around if people don't know the name of Jesus where they know they see it in creation they see God in creation that's what this is saying you we may not hear the name of Jesus people may not hear that Jesus actual name but they cannot deny his word because his word is everywhere right every the heavens declare the glory of the Lord and the firm and it declares this handiwork praise God amen so even though the name of Jehovah wasn't in Esther God's word was manifest through Esther hallelujah how many know the Bible says that Eve was flesh of Adam's flesh word of his word right what does brother random say we're flesh of his flesh we're bones is bone he says we're Spirit of Jesus spirit amen hallelujah that's about our history word of Prayer father we thank you for today Lord God we thank you for this word that we've heard today father I appreciate Lord God sensing your
