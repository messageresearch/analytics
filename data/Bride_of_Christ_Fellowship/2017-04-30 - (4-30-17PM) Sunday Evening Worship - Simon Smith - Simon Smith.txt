right now Lord Jesus though we do get little glimpses and tastes in the scripture order through the preaching of Malachi for we understand it's going to be a glorious time nor we are placing all our faith on that we're believing with riot and Lord Jesus we cannot equate we're meeting with anticipation gasps for them times over for those days Lord the ballooning of the rapidly approaching God as we see the world falling apart God wrote your signs of already left for yes lumber at the end Lord the shout is my fourth God which has the start of the rapture showing you this season is this is a rapture season we love you struck up the steep amed by God's grace grace hoppers by God's grace I want to love teach a little bit on inviting the prisoner amen amen I'm biting the praise God praise God good to see young male head back there with technology the man holding his technology the offspring this is the bow I'm gonna bring some offspring when I got hit really just the facial packs are sitting back there washing off I hope my wife with me is Billa amen amen so one thing you're certain I don't mind small little crowds and little bit Nick Nick small little guy this is straight away so I'm going to teach on a binding and prisoner praise God when I go through with me close one of your days was willing up to I'll put these clothes up there I'm just not that good yet by God's grace where to stand I do it for though we'll just teach on it and we'll go from there wonderfully be able to show you what's taking place and why it's taking place amen hopefully able to get why the seven seals came in our day amen Gloria did find that quote why they glory in this amen another and a new third a or a Westie day seeing that hey hope it's a blessing to my God's grace praise God we could turn to Zechariah for your pastor brother back there there right after second service and you said the scripture write to me so I know this is the number two to go glory glory it was a big thing that we're taking this and these two were for you anyway hi Milo they taste I hope they tasted like oil and honey and a man read yeah yeah we eat bread it makes you thirsty for more David not had a little great even that's fine hey it was at the well always like that water develop best for him because he was it was awesome ready yes sir Laurie I mean Zechariah 4 verse 6 then he answered mistaken to be saying that this is the word of the Lord of the ruble saying not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts oh God the only way you and I are going to make it out of you it is not the mean brother Hanuman brother Jason brother bang and mount I were to start a bodybuilding workout of the session and we're going to pump iron like Arnold and the rest and Ronnie's and all that guys and pop our big big big old cannons on our arms and Beatles eyes and we're going to walk around like we we got it all in control it's not by power not by natural light but it's going to take the spirit of the limit amen yes even we are trusting and depending on that yes yes absolutely not in 2nd Corinthians 32 verse 8 because with him is the arm of flesh Jesus but with us is the Lord our God help us into fight our battles a manifesto as you could go through the Old Testament as you go through the New Testament is continually what we're depending on God hey man we are not smart up to bring this rapture out it may be true I have the quickening power it's not our own it's within us but we are weighing on him yes my man but then in another term he is also waiting on us too sure right right it solves 20 verse 6 he says now I know that I the Lord saying his anointed he will hear from him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand he says some trust in chariots he says seven horses but we will remember the name of the Lord our God which is what the Lord Jesus is so all these you can put your trust in this you can put your trust on that or in a man or a sister or a program or a church ranch but we must put our trust in the Holy Ghost an unseen force that only reveals himself in particular time they met but if we can get into the spirit of it get into the spirit of things that we'll be able to enter in and really meet him face to face are we seeking just for things when I went to go to our prayer closet are we going like this Lord Jesus please help me Lord bless this brother and bless that sister and Lord I need help here I need that when we should be in the closet say Lord reveal yourself to me show me who you are holy God no Lord Mayor anointing and presence be with me or let me see you face to face are we in our prayer closets pray to meet God face to face are we praying that the spirit may come down and changes in a way like no other just like the intended vision where we went if they went into the tent and something happened something changed what was it it was the Spirit of God came down in there and changed him it healed and I made a well full recovery to the rock eh-eh absolute just looked out yes it solves 33 verse 20 is our soul waited for the Lord he is our help he says and he is our shield for our heart shall rejoice in him because we have trusted in his holy name a man named not I might add my power the what I his spirit saith alone yeah I am the name of Jesus Christ we will overcome yes sorry it's all 44 verse 4 he says thou art my king of God command deliverances for Jacob through thee when we pushed down our enemies through thy neighbor we will tread them up under that we rise up again he says probably not trust in my boat neither would I trust my sword to sing he says but thou has saved us from our enemies and put them to shame that hated us amen and what we were waiting on God he we can only trust in the Lord Jesus Christ for what these things are happening absolutely there are little others are little trials in life are these little trials that we go through Italy seem fiery and hard a contentious these are small compared to what's coming right thanks God if we cannot love each other through these we've got issues because much more is coming we're going to see a very very dark day right right absolutely in Ephesians 6:11 st. Paul says put all the whole armour of God amen now we're not natural warriors this is not of the Atlas system the Army has he said put on the whole army I've got armor of God that may be able to withstand against and against the wiles of the devil yes now we're battling what Satan it is minions Satan it is demons as with me as a brother circulate yes it is you will right I saw the smart even so so not so smart demons so very ruthless demons right right so where lies the demon powers go to Matthew 12 verse or 30 Matthew 12 verse 43 what is the demon most powerful when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man from right now you walketh through Dry places seeking rest and find it and done so what now this man has heard the Word of God demon has left he's cast about however and now the man isn't leaving living clean and the demons out what and dry places what good is that team is doing for his kingdom then he said I will return to my house once I came and when he cometh he fight his sweat empty swept and garnished what he did this man had was a sin to be patient he made it all the way to sanctification then he goeth and taketh with himself seven other spirits more awakened yes my then himself you mean this original demon wasn't strong enough to break through the second time at first this man he was taken by one spirit right one spirit or maybe a lolly or or or little thief this or a little stealing of that or whatever and what securing it or anything I got this man he live there enjoy it for years or days or however once right right but then the man muscle got sick of this demon but rise a half to go free spits come pray for me lay your hands on me and connect to God I cast out of the medicine oh I feel so much better hey buddy yes yes and that spirit that lying spirit or whatever kind of spirit was he got lolis he's like man I missed my house he come back and he could not enter into this man so we had to get seven other spirits more powerful right then him it took that much more now to enter into that sanctified bus right which tells us what there are little apples of teaming oh that's right good brother good levels just like our government just like our military is set up in the levels there's the highest man and then it goes down below this and then there's somebody under him and there's somebody under head there's somebody under him and it's all chain of command it's just slightly laughs in this spirit good good right yes sir sure he says he's taken seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there they go her come the vessel right and the last state of the man is worse than the first why because he's got seven times more worse demons than he had before that's right bro that's right he says even so shall be unto this wicked generation ah all right good right now where is the power of the strength now look at the promises greatest battle ever fought yes 62 311 8-4 look what he says he says so much as we have here he says a devil is almost harmless unless he unless he can have something to work as that demon was cast on that man the beginning he was hardness he can hardly do any damage but once a demon enters into a person now the can do damage use that person to but damage verbally physically upon people of God upon anyone now the deevak has a vessel something to control Oh almost like a human tank right right absolutely go he's easy almost harmless that he can have something to work in he says you remember those demons and were cast out Allegiant he said they had they watched you more mischievousness so they wanted to go into the horns he says so Devils must have something to work in somebody to work through he said that's the way God does it do God needs to use a sneaky what you Hey thank you Jesus sure ah or Ephesians 6 verse 12 B 6 verse 12 eases or we wrestle not against flesh and blood but what against principalities against powers against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places what this is this is a chain of command these are levels of spirits from the highest to the lowest we're battling them off put all your spiritual warfare here amen yes like a hell of salvation you better know that you're safe hey man keep this mind pure all divine now that's loot he's God that's right he says wherefore take the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand the evil day now that we're in principalities in the Greek it means the chief or the first the principal that rules principalities those are the most dangerous demons you'll ever face the strongest the most annoying the ones that can get in your head and just dwell there and set up a nest if we're not careful right what is it getting our hearts and put a root of bitterness in there or or or this or a demon or something you know we have one weak spot right we regarded with all of our with all of our strength and then one of these strong guys into your weak spot could be finished unless you you laughter you're weeded out right right now look at the Prophet as he's going through his ministry here in 53 he starts as is he's getting he's getting more and more exhausted he's a prophet god he could see in the supernatural demon algae 53 e 12 he says friends they're just as real as your real he's talking about demons he's talking about his personal contact with demons he says I see them some of them are the shape of bats yeah he says look at like long hairs hanging on their legs all the people pieces but an epileptic demon looks like a tortoise with round legs and he's describing these demons of an affliction that are all the people that God is allowed of the cast off him and he's telling people this is what he sings look like there he is he says hanging up like that and he up however they hang up he says but usually a demon of oppression seems to be more like a cloud form he says he says like away and it just makes you go funny noise he's what is what is when you're in that dimension to see the spirit ah so he's describing on how these demons look we know that the destard looks like a hood over you right he says but now he is now you may think that that's wrong but some of the one of these days you'll realize if you could just take a spiritual looking glass and look into your soul he says your your doubt you'll find out what it looks like he says in the greatest devil the chief of all Devils is unbelief he says and there's only and that's the only seat there is oh boy so he's dealing with what these are global level demons right here these all these these cancer causing this night ozone or we're dealing with much greater than that now sure remember those are demons nothing I was like above listen what's the most dangerous kind huh right now and we know how the private talk about that maniac that went to that big strong man he comes up to the services minister or however he said he says I'm going to crush every bone in your body and the Prophet said he was like six however is 200 somehow Palsy said he could and he had the ability to do he come up a challenge of profit and this this and this he says you're nothing but I hired this you're that you're that whatever this is that right challenging the man of God look at the boldness of the devil right right right sure he said now picking up with that story that maniac that monster was going to go knock brother Graham clear across the way that whatever he said when I look at the man I heard myself talking I don't know whether it may sound strange but it was the Holy Spirit speaking he says the Bible said take no thought what you'll to say in that out right this is it'll be added then he says because it's the pious because you have defied the Spirit of God tonight he will fall over my feet and what that man he said well he said well show you who is he doth fall over and he was and he went matches rolls over back like this to put a big old cloud or fist on the prophet's face he says and he truths big on back and started to hit me like he said and I said say kid come on man just about like that in the name of the Lord cheese man hey man he says Indiana's be going back like this two strikes he started the old they see the dizzy Dan sort of hit this is in his eyes rolled back he started going around and around like that and fell down right on right on the prophets feet right this probably said he couldn't move but the policeman said is he dead yet probably he is not dead is he gonna get better he said no he said he loves that spirit that's right since he's healing he said no he says he worships that spirit he won't give it up he says but now look he says but if you just move him off my feet so when I got there I just turned around to see the audience I said as I was saying faith is the substance of things hoped for he says an ax man sitting chair just raised up now what's your place there he hasn't even really even started preaching or however and Satan comes down through a jive dundas man a vessel right and once the not stopped the word from going forth and the Holy Spirit casts it out and all the Prophet does is you start back out says his face this and all of a sudden oh man and wheelchair jumps what took place what was it he says the sheath of that tribe of demons he says had made the challenge and lost it you see and that's when the Spirit of God struck the building he says that everything was healed he says and at that time when the even said I seen their chief man two beauties they just began to rise up on the wheelchairs that cost everything to stretcher early it was done because the it's all right yeah yeah yeah yeah see how it works would you know the higher yes sir we can if we can be the one unbelief that one devil um buddy thanks God nothing will be impossible hey hey hey mad man ah I want to show you something here go to Matthew 17 verse 14 so the hierarchy in the spiritual realm chief demons lower level demons those are just trying to stay in the hell and just whatever they are but I'm good up here it would be totally an effective our our I know but they're doing with a hierarchy yes sir but now look with the Saints now look with this devil 50:17 verse 14 and they were going to come down were come to the multitude there came a certain and he leaned out him and say lord have mercy on my son he says for he is a lunatic and sore back from all times you fall it into the fire and off into the water and I've been sought in projects that I disciples and they could not for yes his disciples were powerless yes sir right and then jesus answered and said o faithless and perverse generation how long shall I be with you how long shall I suffer you bring me live to me and Jesus refused to devil right he says and he departed out of him in the child was cured from that very hour now what take place here this is Lucas and then Jesus needed waking up cast him out they said the psychosis why do we not cast him out what you said because of your unbelief all right what's so powerful what is the main thing that I got out of this portion of the chapter of this book record directly before this they did but had what the message the rapture revelation revealed to them d-doesn't been broken in type form the rapture is being the tribulation heal they are caught up of the fiction it doesn't matter how many mysteries you know it doesn't matter this if this messages come to you or not why could not be disciples cast them out they saw the vision they understood what it meant they even talked about Elias I thought Elijah come and keeps that he's putted right but if you receive this message verse 21 howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fast amen the Holy Ghost was to use your vessel as well that's right if we are not pray and fasting like we should we'll be popping the Holy Ghost is powerless in right amen ah he needs you two vessels you got and what does that prayer passing do it gets us out of the picture it's a supplication it's a real reverence reverencing god of selsun Lord take more control over me as I make myself we die here to my best Amen baby man glory and they could not cast out this chief demon ma the revelation of the hour without prayer and fasting was only so strong yes sir yes sir beautiful now now the Prophet goes into it more and more as he's going into the prayer lines and the prayer meetings and all these things these as his meetings continue on and on and on and he reveals a little bit more to us do you now believe 53 1206 e e9 t 4 he says now a round about her as a dark cloud seems to be about this square when I look at her it's coming in going he says that's the demon he says as soon as how do I know it he couldn't feel it pulling from out here he's so sensitive the spirit he says what is it everyone out there is screaming for help so now he's just showing and revealing it wasn't if there's someone with cancer there's someone with the disease with certain assistance if the demons about ready to cast out and it feels the face of the person on the inside rising and that things going to have to go just like that band that was cured of that one that was a spirit I already cut cleanser didn't garnishing the sky dragon if a spirit within him know he's about ready to leave you know call out for help right right showing what that demon is only so strong against faith that's right I guess the Spirit of God not by my and my power but what the Spirit of God absolutely amen everybody screaming for help because I can feel the face of you believers moving in he says and it can be done it can be done and singers crying help help and their face is crying it can be done they can't be done big man and what we know these demons the real ones cause for more health clothing for spiritual a fallen angel backup power hola try and cook plant seeds that they cannot be healed in their heads real quickly during the service as Malachi 4 is preaching a word and from leaving it a telling them they can be hit like a field the demons are now trying to whisper in these broken people's ears and say you can't you can't you can't you're going to be remained this for the rest of your life for the rest of your life for the rest of your life absolute but what the sphere and the people are saying yes we can it can be done it can be done while the demons are crying for more help and more down ma that's sure hey man now verse the contending for the baby that was once delivered unto the Saints 55 let's just say praise the Lord you believe it he says don't be disturbed he says demons will scream at everything he's but we're in the presence of Christ no wonder evil spirits cry out they know their time has come yes amen no now we know there's a hierarchy you know there's chief demons a little even this is all Chi demons right yes and of course who is the main who is their leader they're led their main henchman is the devil himself lucifer or satan that great old that that old serpent right right now uncertain sound 61 ether t 1 he is now he says but citizen tracking anyway you take it sin is attractive to the human be he says because he the subject of a bond race that we are he says and it's attractive Satan knows how to make it attractive he says he's a genius and his job all right right Satan is an absolute geez one time I was hanging out with the man you just come into the Word of God he's a big man six foot five six equal 36 for we're talking about the word and he said he said of Satan ever he said he said the season of Satan's here right now he said I'd knock him knock him right knocked a block right off I'm looking right now Allah but he was singing this he was just trying to make a challenge of Satan with his own and strength right and you know in two weeks he was back out in the world my goodness Satan said oh yeah I'll get you I'll get you in no time that's right what you took him out he's never been back since not good don't ever think that you're more than a match for Ziggler out the spirit all right yes sir yes sir he's a genius you got a spot but he won't get us gain or loss but I ain't gonna here yes absolutely all right here's a did you know that in heaven that the devil was God's right-hand man at the beginning he knows all about God he knows how God operates he knows what God my things like he was actually there covering the anointed covering cherub you're my closest thing that God there was in his creation all right I know about yes sir and he had a realm he said that was loosely for the son of mourning was given power and the reason he brought sin into the world he was able to take something that God created and perverted back into an evil thing see he's a genius how would he even know to prefer concentration he's an absolute genius how did he figure that out she's a cow part of how they were produced move on listen this produce move on this is this I'm wearing a word we need in his mind when you come up with the idea bring the serpent and how would he know that would cross three right genius yes sir good you must had his little scene microscope out there take a little skin samples looking at the they however somehow he figured it out right he figured out how to break the continuity gossamer yes drew let me know the stage was set it was set for God allowed him to figure it out amen he must left some kind of clue the Lord just didn't take it he'll get it he's a something the little irises like this one's so close to you like this looks just like Adam it must be close to this right yes sir that's right he says the right-hand man of Almighty God was loose with the son of Maury the first God granted him almost coworkers with him he was a co-worker Satan himself help me God doing the will of God knowing the will of God knowing how God can latch onto the heart of a person hold it and just obviously knowing how the Word of God would come in church services in heaven right knowing how to worship Wert in heaven ah right right brother he knew all these things about the church use all these things about God's ways he's a genius he says partly even with him only Satan could not create right he says God is the only creator a Satan took something that God created him to run back in something else you right amen yes now turn with me to Jude cover this a little bit I got praise praise God praise God the book of Jude is a very interesting book it kind of jumps from you look at it it's like Junction here in here and jumps from this thing this saw to this top this doesn't vary this is one of the most mysterious little books extract the most mysterious book there it decided for me because it's like man it hits all these things to jump from this and jumps jumps and just hit this is a very a very it's no so close revelations maybe that's why they were the revelry you know anything is jumping on it like it's a steelbook person it's very interesting yes sir Laurie but as you read the book a Jew he's warning the people in Jude 4 he says where there are men certain men crept in unawares he's more than a wolf come right but now they're in verse 5 he says I want you to remember some things keep these things in remembrance I will therefore therefore put you in remembrance though he once knew this how did the Lord having saved the people on the land of Egypt afterward destroyed them to believe not yes he said remember this man because of their unbelief he brought about and because their unbelief yes yes yes Jesus and look at the number two things says remember and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day why would he warn the efficient age this about the Angels leaving that refers to say these fallen spirits leaving their first estate why he warned them if they're not spirit II your man we're man we're human we're mortal right for something daughters of God what he reminds of this he says that the Angels was kept not their first estate what was it Satan rose up against God up in heaven before we were even there there was a war in heaven and the Bible says the Satan wanted to make his kingdom greater than Michaels right and he went through these these angels now the Angels had a certain place a certain portion in heaven that was their inheritance they were they were created there they're supposed to stay there Satan deceive these demons and brought them down and now other false spirits and they'll never ever find their place in there up again they're done they have there's no way to kill a spirit y'all do

doing the same thing exactly what the scripture said of a doing what's he doing about he's doing it by the man of those great economy moves who does not know God and many of them in the Pentecostals because they're doing the same what is it he's doing with all in angel amen fallen Luther's they were number one those that followed Paul the first prophet the first messenger were number one for the day right they were number one they were the cream of the crop that's right going to follow marching or number one of the day yes that was a crate they were the best shot hands time yes and then Luther Rossum he was number one the great reformer yes he was the best God had yes Wesley come up and he was even greater in understanding yes'm and spiritual gifts fallen angels came and lost their crews yes yes if the Luthor's would have stayed if you are to the world god we'd be Lutheran right right if the West is that the Pentecostals were to stay with the Word of God we'd be Weston

Christmas tree you've got a real 63 I'm under 51 I'm trying to bring you the threefold revelation or mystery of God what do they do he says they sold out to reasoning as a wisdoms and education like eat it for the angels did Wesley was a man of God but what followed him he says fallen angels got into it was the Angels first creative beings of God but fell from Lucifer's wisdom says and you see what they become fully Eagles and organizations from men of God who went forth to establish truth in the earth before the truth to go on and proclaim and get on to the real revelation of Christ see my regatta slowly bringing his horse and he makes a church here a mustard fits my messenger gives him the word as they stay with the word and the messenger brings forth the message to the people and says the people are filled with oligos and what he said stay with the word say the word investor goes off the scene right the people were made and now the spirits now come down at work yes sir yes now they're dead and God has to do another move again Hey he says the for the truth could go on to proclaim to get on to the real revelation of Christ for all angels come in at 200 remaining denomination that's the reason the revelation of the seventh seal mystery has to be an olive oil it had to stop that cycle is over what sense of God that's why what we will never die will not see that because I
