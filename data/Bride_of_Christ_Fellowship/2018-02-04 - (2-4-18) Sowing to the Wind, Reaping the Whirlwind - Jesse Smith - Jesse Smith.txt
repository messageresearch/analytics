here in the Bible maybe we can sing that bring them in I don't I just forgot to sing that that's let's everybody song I say that [Music] scriptures in Luke 18 verse 15 and they brought unto Him also infants that he would touch them and when his disciples saw it they rebuked them but Jesus called them unto him and said suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not for such is the kingdom of God verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall no wise enter therein a man were so thankful to have Wesley and Naomi and Beatrice here and of course their little darling girls as well let's give them around plough so nice to have them here by the grace of Lord now looking at the meaning for Eden in the Hebrew it means pleasure or delight and you know of course we know the Garden of Eden was a place of pleasure pure pleasure and delight and that's what we're just gonna pray that God will make Eden a dwelling place for God's presence that her life will be a pure pleasure and delight and I remember dedicating nature and praying that she would have the divine nature of Christ and remember dedicating virtue that she would have the divine strength and power of the character of Jesus I loved but she loved those Bible names like that like the other names - but it's just yeah I'm not saying they're better names and they're all good names by God's grace because the name we all fall under is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's the name we've all got to fall under but I just appreciate the meanings behind these names and appreciate this family and all their support for the church by the grace of the Lord we love them very much so I'm gonna pardon I'm gonna take the baby asleep in here oh she's precious father in heaven this is your life this is your heritage I'm holding the heritage of God in my hands thank you for this life this precious life Eden or God as the searcher Lord teaches as there was a place of pleasure basic sure to life may her life may your soul be the dwelling place of your spirit or that her life would be a pure delight a pure pleasure for your name Lord God for the name of the Lord Jesus Christ thus Wesley was strength to lead Lord according to the word and they only to submit for no home by the Holy Spirit and each child each daughter fall in line trained up in the ways the Lord if the interest strength and grace to provide this mother support Lord we just thank you for this family Lord God who asked you to bless this soul Lord as we dedicate this baby unto you or the family gives it back to you nor your symbolically handing it over to me but really putting in the hands of our Lord and Savior the now start hands take this life Lord it's dedicated to you Lord that this light be consecrated for the purpose of Almighty God the Lord that this soul would be saved sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost Lord serving you all the days of her life and Lord bless this precious family would I glory Lord we're so grateful for all you've done Lord continue the great work you started in this life in this family in Jesus Christ's name Amen what a blessing that is praise the Lord let's sing one more song here by the grace of Lord let's stand and sing I shall not be moved Jesus is my Savior [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] for this ability of the rock of God's Word let's take our Bibles this morning let's go to hosea chapter 8 I've had a little thought on my part all week and looking at sowing and reaping and so I like to just take the thoughts kind of off the regular trend of the recent series we've been doing on the church ages and worship and there's some other series I work at on a kit though the modesty series we've been working on by the grace of the Lord let's go to Hosea 8 verse 7 Isaiah 8 7 Daniel Hosea you can find Daniel you'll find Hosea Daniel Hosea Joel Amos Hosea chapter 8 verse 7 and then we'd like to go to Galatians chapter 6 after that by the grace of the Lord like to preach on sowing to the wind reaping the whirlwind with a subtopic of sowing and reaping this warning because the topic of what am i off well okay I got new batteries but I got the batteries up here so you don't have to go in their mouth can I put them under the pulpit sorry about that because this text of course is a judgment scripture this is a judgment upon Israel Hosea chapter 8 verse 7 harden I just got to get a few batteries out of here [Music] Hosea 8 verse 7 alright I think there's power thank god the power of Christ never runs out God made sure he gave you a sea of the Holy Ghost unto the day of your Redemption so your power doesn't run out hey man thank God Hosea eight seven let's read it together on three one two three four they have sown the wind and they shall reap the whirlwind it hath no stalk the bud shall yield no meal if is a yield sorry the stranger shall swallow up part of me I lost my spot let's go to Galatians chapter 6 pardon me blasian 6 verse 7 Galatians seven be not deceived God is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap for he that so it to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting and let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not and as we have opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith let's have one more word of Prayer if you ever need on your heart just make it known unto God here maybe you signifying with the raising of your hand Heavenly Father Lord we bowed our heads Lord we're looking to heaven dear God we lifted holy hands we've sung your songs Lord we love you today Jesus and father we want you to speak to us we know this is your way you said gather mowers you see that day approaching Lord God's st. Paul preached on the first day of the week Lord God one time so long into the midnight hours Lord God the gathering of the Saints was so precious then and Lord we realised that it's happening it's repeating again today the gathering of the Saints is so precious today as well for Lord we have the faith of the Apostolic fathers speak to us Lord help me to get out of your way I'm nothing Lord I make mistakes all the time but lord use these lips of clay for the next few moments Lord anoint me to bless your people may their hearts be anointed Lord to receive the seeds of God and father will be grateful Lord for all you do Lord today we recognize your presence bless your children and Laura let faith rise in every heart in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless you being seated praise God actually the the origin of this message I guess would say as I've been writing this book on modesty like I came to this chapter on fashion the fashion in the United States and in the history of the Bible I'm sorry the history of fashion United States and the Bible and so I just like to I like to carry my manuscript around so I can just encourage myself so I don't quit so I've got 31 thousand words I got all that I got chapters 1 through 6 done by God's grace I just like to pack that with me so I know I don't get discouraged I don't get distracted I just want to do the will of God so a very very thankful I just want to make sure I remember that's where I got the inspiration for this message because we today are seeing the part of the whirlwind that America has sewn to America has sewn confusion their clothes they've sown shone sown rebellion and letting women cut their hair and men grow their hair long and men wear shorts and women wear shorts and cross dress and wear men's pants and everything like that and we prove that on Wednesday if you didn't see Wednesday's message I think you'd really like that we showed all the history therefore United States so if you're curious about that I encourage you to it's on the YouTube archives you can get that but I believe that's what we're seeing now people so confused they're born with certain body parts and they're confused which gender they are that confusion could only come from Satan and the Holy Spirit is not the author of confusion he's the author of order he's the author of understanding but you must first have the fear of the Lord and then you have the beginning of wisdom to understand the ways of God and so we're reaping we're starting to see the reaping of that now reaping the whirlwind was actually the judgment literally poured out so our country has not yet received that brother branham said it's going to strike back in 64 remember when Alaska almost sunk he said judgment is coming to the west coast and so we know that it's coming and it's struck in minor ways we're having birth pains but the whirlwind itself has not come yet the whirlwind will be the Tribulation Period I mean know that by God's grace we are the country is currently not we as the believers the country the country is sowing to the wind and they're going to reap Oh whirlwind we know that but I want to I'm gonna course start with the judgmental the hard part of this message and then hopefully end with the encouraging part of the message because this is just a thought that brother Bram said and many times as well and the Bible says it many times the Bible lists sowing reaping whirl winds that's all over the Bible so I want to just preach on this this morning sowing to the wind reaping the whirlwind and with a subtopic of sowing and reaping Malka I can switch over here I do have a few slides I'll be mostly preaching out of my notes but I do have a few slides to show you so we're looking at sowing to the wind and the ministry of Hosea I want to start with this ministry of Hosea and I show this back in 2015 I remember when I preach on Hosea because a man had just come in and we had a marvelous service of just praising and shouting and cry and I I know Beatrice was there too and I remember it was a wonderful time in the Lord it was three years ago to the month in February of 2015 but here's Hosea Hosea lived around this time that was his life span 785 - 725 BC and so we're gonna be talking about his life here and then he was a prophet we'll look at two northern Israel shortly after his years of prophecy northern Israel was taken into captivity around 722 BC so here 750 BC there 625 BC so it wasn't long after Hosea prophesied that they'd actually reap the whirlwind that he was prophesying about and so I just want to leave that up there just for a few moment moments there he prophesied over 40 years and so I think that's not as that's not his life span I'm sorry that's a live longer than that I think that was his years of prophecy if so I got my numbers mixed up so forgive me that's the same slide I used in 2015 so I haven't looked at it much so pardon me if that date is wrong anyways he prophesied about 40 years he began in the reign of Jeroboam ii and he was mainly prophesying to northern israel at some point of it at the end of his life Hosea moved from Jerusalem I'm sorry moved to Jerusalem from Cimmerian you can see that his writings as well there's there's a few prophecies at the end of the book that goes directly to Jerusalem but he spent most of his time in northern Israel preaching to the Northern Kingdom now I'm gonna skip it I think I got a few slides I mixed up here yeah I mixed that one up parmi so this blue this side is the northern Israel this side is Judah member there was a division of the kingdoms and so the ministry of Hosea was probably in these five kings and then at the end of his life he kind of moved Jerusalem and you may have prophesied the history says under ahaz and hezekiah course Hezekiah was a pretty good King brother man calls him a a a borderline or believer but he was a believer a good good King and so that was the kind of the time period that he he preached in and if you read the book of Hosea which I haven't read all of it but I read numerous scriptures this morning read the whole chapter of chapter 8 this morning the reign of Jeroboam ii this first king up here was a reign of great military ruling by worldly standards their army was at its greatest strength and isn't interesting how America is trying to build up its army now they downsize under the last administration and now they're trying to upgrade again and make their military force so great their economy was strong as its Hosea 12-8 says that their economy was very strong the future actually looked bright and there was optimistic forecasts about their safety it was optimistic about the money situation it looked like Israel was doing good under Jeroboam ii they're very optimistic let's read Hosea 12a just you can see kind of the this description here of Samaria Hosea 12 verse 8 you see what I'm talking about that's what I love about this new Bible that I got so the people at Copley gave it to me as a gift and I love it because it gives an overview gives like two pages of review and the historical things and it always references the scripture which is just a nice help you know you can easily find facts hosea 12 8 and Efram now Ephraim always refers to northern Israel because Ephraim was the oldest son of Israel and Ephraim said yet I am become rich I have found me out substance in all my Labor's they have found none iniquity and me that were sin okay so that's what affirmed said I become rich I found out the substance so see they were there they're rich is just like layer to see remember last week we preached the eight types of Laodicea in the script brother man talked about of course there's more than that but those are just the ones that he preached about they were rich and increased with Goods all things are going so well during this king our our leader is so prosperous everything is prospering and little did they know judgment you know eight seven ninety three two seven twenty two judgment was seventy years away and everything was going to be totally wiped out the people of God were going to be carried away to Assyria little did they know but look they were encouraged at this time we're rich and this is a striking condition that they were in the stability of their government literally left after jeroboams death notice they have six more kings all within the timeframe of thirty years that's not that wasn't good for Israel and how many know you have to have a stable life how many one is stable leader in your life on your job you want a stable person there who's there all the time it's not good when the leadership gets turned over over and over and over again because you have different voices different leadership's all kinds of different things to learn you know we had that in our school recently what just went from principal the principal and everybody's just they're more relaxed now because we've had a stable leader who looks like they're gonna stay for a while they're not trying to leave or go somewhere else like that stability does so much for the people of God and during this time Assyria wasn't even a real enemy as here had been beaten during the time of Jeroboam but after Jeroboam died Assyria grew back to strength and God was raising them up to punish or chasing his people for their rebellious acts so they quickly rose to power and Israel of course was doomed so Hosea's message gives four parts it gives indictment and i'ts all the people of israel for their sins and it lists all their sins and then second it gives instruction about how they can get right with God thirdly and then issues the judgments of God and fourthly then it offers hope at the end now the first three chapters are parallel this is what Amen will probably remember for those who were there three years ago I know it's a long time the first three chapters are parallel between the love of the Lord for Israel and the love of Hosea for Gomer his prostitute wife and this is a marriage that God had arranged and we dramatized I remember that how he dramatized it you know Hosea came from a godly family he was you'll probably you know thinking praying about the the virgin daughters of Israel which one he might marry and God said no you're gonna go take Gomer the prostitute and how his mind just must have been little shaken but he did it anyway he was an obedient prophet aren't you glad for obedient people they're obedient to the word of the Lord both God and Hosea were obedient husbands with unfaithful wives and Hosea has three children through Gomer and all three's names represent the accusation against Israel and they're called to repentance so God was naming them the condition of the people and how they must repent God named them after that he was trying to show them that God is dealing with you you've got to take God at His Word you've got to believe the word of the Lord and what did God send them to God send them some great big angel from heaven he sent them a prophet just like today he sends a simple preacher God could have said anything he could have sent something he could have sent a chariot of fire war and my people but what does God always said a preacher who's preaching thus saith the Lord amen and that's God's Way it's always God's Way listen to the saith the Lord obey thy saith the Lord and you'll you'll reap the right things amen so the first three chapter show the pain and the persistence of divine love divine love can suffer long with someone like recently I was telling you I was counseling a marriage couple and one of the persons is like you know I think I just need to leave and take some time off and I said no I warned them do not do that don't let the Sun go down upon your wrath make it right as soon as possible and so I prayed for that couple and the husband texted me and said all these other things we just kept praying and then it worked out where the wife didn't leave you know there were certain circumstances that worked out and so we there was some hope there see because divine love the Bible says charity suffers long and when you really look down to your soul and see why did I marry this person or or why did I fall in love with this person who did I promise what promise did I make in front of all these witnesses and and what promises that I make when we really look at that and we really base our actions upon that it shows what condition our souls in but we've got to make the right decision praise God and the same thing for you and I with our spiritual walk those of us who aren't married right we've made the vow I'm gonna serve you Jesus so we must be faithful to serve Jesus amen just like we must be faithful to our husband and wife unwavering there must be total total dedication total discipline we must have that same dedication to Christ amen because we're his wife remember at the end of chapter 3 Hosea goes there to the slave house and he buys back his life after she ran out numerous times on he B brings he sells off his harvest and he brings all the money and he trades the the barrels of barley and he buys his wife back a woman he's already married a woman that should have already been in this house but his love says even though you've left me and ran after other men and all these things I still love you and my love for you will not end what a picture of the cross of Jesus Christ amen Israel runs from God runs from God and God says his own son said I'm gonna pay the price I'm gonna buy back my unfaithful wife because I love her and he paid the ultimate price did Christ just like Hosea paid a great price for his own wife's freedom from slavery aren't you glad you're free from sin amen we are god forbid that we should be slaves to sin amen we should not continue in sin that sin may abound god forbid we should be free we should be victorious we should have Satan under our feet amen remember like the scripture said in in the in the Romans 16 that God will bruise Satan under your feet shortly amen has anybody experienced that praise God I hope you have are you guys a Satan is under my feet hallelujah now chapters Florida 7 is the 3 fold accusation and the call to repent and then chapters 8 through 14 is alternating chapters of lament of God lament of Hosea 4 Israel and of course our text was in chapter 8 where God is telling Hosea what to say pronouncing judgment that lament upon Israel now in Chapter 8 let's go to chapter 8 Hosea chapter 8 we're in Chapter 12 let's go back to chapter 8 Israel was just in an awful awful condition and I want you to know that they were going to church and they were doing all the church duties and yet still they were living lives contrary to their church life sound familiar like the Pharisees Sadducees they went to church they were the first ones at church they're the last ones that leave because they love to be seen in public right Israel is super religious they kept multiplying their altars they the so the scripture says here in Hosea they kept having more and more altars there they were outwardly religious but inwardly they were rotting bones dead men's bones look at verse 1 in Chapter 8 set the trumpet my mouth he should come as an eagle against the house of Lord because they have transgressed my covenant and trans I'm sorry trespassed my law the Covenant and the law were broken by Israel now I want to bring out the altar scriptures I believe it's in verse 8 and 9 I just wrote the whole it was verses 8 to 14 okay that's verse 11 I'm sorry Jose 8:11 because Ephraim have made many altars to sin altars shall be sin unto Him so see they had altars at church but they also had altars to sins so they were worshipping all the time they come to church they'd raise their hands maybe little bit or they'd sing along with everybody they had altars they bring their sacrifices and they would they would go through the motions but they had other altars outside our only altars should be at the altar of Christ amen that should be the only place where we sacrifice our lives for is Jesus everything else is just secondary but see they were so religious the Bible said they had idols and calves and prostitution and sins and they forgot their Creator this is all in chapter 8 and then God lays out this scripture as we said in verse 7 for they have sown to the wind so any time you break a command of God you're sowing to the wind you're planting to win and winds represent Wars strife and trouble any time you disobey one command of God like David he broke one command of God which we'll get to with adultery right you're planting to trouble you plant in us and it's many seeds and and remember when you plant something generally it's gonna multiply a hundredfold whether they're good or bad thirtyfold sixtyfold like they'll tell you that you plant something that's going to multiply hoes they planted some tulips at our house and they sure didn't multiply right they're just going to multiply they're going to take over it same thing with sinful actions if we allow sinful actions they're going to multiply the gonna spread the profit tells us this he says what does wins mean the Bible for any of you Bible interpreters here wins means Wars and strife trouble no I just want to show the positive side to a whirlwind is not always a bad thing a whirlwind took Elijah to heaven hallelujah God talked to job out of the whirlwind glowing Ezekiel saw the four beasts come out of a whirlwind in heaven amen it represents the power of God to the believer now to those who've transgressed the law of God it represents a storm of judgment whirlwind actually means tempest or storm in the Hebrew so see God God constantly likens his ways and his power and his acts in a whirlwind a powerful force that no man can stop amen on Olivia he's constantly liking that to himself now we have many scriptures to read but I'm gonna just in hit the highlights in Psalms 58 9 the Bible said before your pots can feel the thorns he shall take them away as with the whirlwind both living in his wrath the righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the Vengeance he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked so again we see a whirlwind as God's vengeance against wicked people proverbs chapter 1 God tells Israel because you didn't hear my wisdom he said when you call out to me in the day of the calamity he said I will not hear your prayer I'll laugh at your calamity propers 126 I will mock when your fear comes when your fear cometh as desolation and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind when distress and anguish cometh upon you then shall they call upon me but I will not answer they shall seek me early but they shall not find me so see this in this in these cases woe and represents the power of the judgments of God and God is going to let this whirlwind pass and bring forth his judgment he says it again isaiah 66:15 for behold the lord will come with fire and with his chair 'it's like a whirlwind to render his anger with fury see he had a chariot of fire a whirlwind a fight with elijah the same thing happened here when he says this with Isaiah he's got a chariot like a whirlwind and it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked you know they asked us that practice this week they said what's the one thing you would have seen a leader never he said intelligence and smartness and all these things and yes what do you think mr. Smith I said the fear of the Lord and he smiled he said you got to be smart he's got to be you know quick and he's got to be intelligent he's got to be up-to-date all these things but the one thing a real leader needs is the fear of God because that's the beginning of getting somewhere to be in a wise Virgen amen you've got to fear God you got to fear the judgments of God see sinners take chances they do a little sin and then Oh God didn't strike me down they'll curse his name and say oh you know he didn't cursed me down let God strike me down if I do this and God will have mercy on them God could strike them down but they'll keep going him pretty soon they get so calloused to the conviction of the Holy Spirit that the Bible said God gives them over to a reprobate mind which means the Castaway mind a rejected mind a condition where they cannot feel the Holy Spirit aren't you glad when you feel the conviction of the Holy Spirit hallelujah Jeremiah 23:19 said behold a whirlwind of the Lord is gone forth in fury God's upset here comes a whirlwind no we think of twisters you know I don't think God I don't think God's always upset with the Midwest and they go through you know though I mean I don't think God's always upset with them I think just part of nature you know time and chance you know you want to live by the sea God deal with tsunamis you know you live by this you live in Ohio you got to deal with snow you know but no doubt there are times where God has sent war winds of destruction to pour forth his fury upon sinners no doubt about that Nahum chapter one says the burden of nineveh I love that the burden of nineveh the burden of the word of Lord the book of the vision of Nahum the Elco sight God is jealous and the Lord revenge of the Lord revenge earth and is furious the Lord will take vengeance on his adversaries and he reserved wrath for his enemies the Lord is slow to anger amen glory he slow and great in power and will not at all acquit the wicked the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind in the storm and the clouds and the dust of his feet it takes a long time before God sends the whirlwind God is slow to anger he's quick to forgive he's rich in mercy he's long-suffering he saves to the utmost but when he gets upset he sends forth the whirlwind that's right church now in Galatians 6 we read that as our text that's kind of my background on Hosea so I can't turn a corner here remember God is not mocked and that means to turn the nose up at well I'll do this whatever the Word of God says I don't care what the Bible says the Greek literally means that to turn the nose up at I'm not gonna listen to a preacher I'm not gonna listen to that and the context is helping a brother who's overtaken in a fault you must do it with meekness and in fear and then the Bible says don't be deceived God cannot be mocked - this person overtaken in a fault they're they're reaping what they showed they are taking a fault because they've been faulty with the Word of God you understand and God will not be mocked whatever a man soweth that shall he reap and here's what we must do we must not sow to the flesh we must sow to the holy spirit we must plant seeds in our lives of spiritual things I've been teaching at the middle school I teach of different thoughts at the middle school in elementary at the middle school we can go a little deep over on ings and priests now last week I taught him how to be a king you got a rule over sin the flesh the devil the world the Bible says we reign in life by Jesus Christ lusts doesn't reign over me I reign over it fear doesn't reign over me I reign over fear anger doesn't rule over me the peace of God rules over anger amen because I'm a king I thought I told the kids I said you know what you're looking at a king did you know that they said what are you talking about I'm a spiritual King because I'm ruling over the sins that used to rule over me they're now under my feet hallelujah and so we must all be spiritual kings 1 this week's lesson is priests and a priest ministers for the people between the people and God he's the one that had to you know slice that the neck of the sacrifice he's the one that had to catch the blood he had to go apply the blood for this individual aren't you glad he applied the blood you know and that nice is that God gives you somebody who's holy then you might not be holy but he gives you somebody holy to apply the blood for you and they were all thankful for the high priest amen because he went in there and he when he went in there he went in for himself his family and for the entire nation of Israel and Jesus Christ as the high priest of our profession he went in there for Laodicea he went in there for emphasis he went in for America he went in for Hong Kong he went in there for Africa he went in there for everybody because Jesus is the high priest Jesus is interceding for all of us right now amen he lives to intercede he lives to have mercy waiting for someone to call out him mercy to him in prayer he's just waiting to answer you cannot not God and the Bible says don't get weary and planning good seeds don't see a harvest for a few years don't get weary keep planting you will reap in due season so whatever we so Israel is planting to the wind they were planting trouble they're planting sin and they're gonna reap a whirlwind of storm but the Bible says if we plant righteousness we shall reap eternal life hallelujah now Hosea go to hell is a a 10 verse 12 let's go there since we're already in Hosea here's the hope that Hosea is giving to the people of God he's offering much hope and that's what every real man of God does he rebukes sin he balls-out sin just like John the Baptist he didn't mean to hurt her odious inherit brother man tells us he did it he'd bald them out because he loved them and wanted to see them right with God so he balls out he cuts everything to pieces and then he offers the hope of God glory Hosea 10:12 so look to yourselves in righteousness and you will what reap and what reap in mercy how many well only want God's mercy on their life well then you must plant seeds of righteousness if you want God's mercy you must plant the right seeds of obedience the Bible said the merciful right there's so many rewards for the merciful blessed are the merciful for they shall see God I think I got that one right that's right I preached on two years ago I forget now I can't remember everything so do righteousness you harvest mercy amen break up your fallow ground look he's telling them what to do you've got hard hearts he's saying for it is time to seek the Lord so it's clear your heart is hard when you have a hard time seeking God in your life can you say Amen that's the I don't know everybody that wasn't here last Sunday I had to dream my brother Brandon last Sunday night or Saturday night did you guys hear that on the livestream ok and I talked about the Brooks this week guess what he had a prayer dream a brother Branham on the same night the first time you ever had a prayer a brother branham I'm starting up a dream of brother Branham so I had a dream a brother Branham on Saturday night last night so - brother Brooks and we didn't even know it do we talk this week and I told you my prayer I was in the prayer line I'm coming up on the right hand the brother branham we'd say right here I say brother branham you know I want things better in the church I wanted to see the Holy Ghost moving in the church and he looked at me and kind of rebuked me and he said you haven't seen you haven't saw it God about it he said and I kind of left really sad because I thought I was thinking God but when I got out of the dream I felt encouraged because the Bible says that if we seek Him with all of our hearts we'll find him and God knows I want to seek Him God knows I want to find him amen well I had brother I'd call brother Brooks for his birthdays birthday was Wednesday Scott's birthday happy birthday belated birthday brother and brother Brooks his dream was like this he said he was in a meeting with brother Branham he said he left for some reason came back and all the people were praying and brother BAM looked out and he said there will be a 10th meeting there will be a Tet meeting there will be a Tet meeting and we saw how prayer was involved in both them seeking God in my prayer and I'm sure my dream and then prayer of the people and then I told brother Brooks he said I don't understand that exactly I said brother Brooks did you know brother Branham said the age of the Lord told him what that little tent room was he said it was the closet and brother BAM said that's scripturally right he said look because jesus said go in your closet and pray so both of our dreams were speaking the same thing we need to seek God and we need to pray more well I was hoping for something better than that brother Jessie I hope not the Bible said it's time to seek the Lord if you want mercy you've got a show to righteousness and sowing the righteousness in this case means seeking the Lord and praying and seeking the face of God it's time to see God I like this until he come and reign righteousness upon you oh my the rain shower the noin ting the latter rain how do you have praise God the former rain laterade look at verse 13 you plowed wickedness that's what you plowed he says you've reaped iniquity you have eaten the fruit of lies because thou did trust in thy way in the multitude of mighty men never trusting in Jeroboam they're trusting in all these warriors and and leaders that they had and God Jose says you cannot trust in them you're believing lies in church we've got the word of truth we've got the holy spirit of truth if anybody should believe truth we should believe truth because we've got thus saith the Lord on truth now I got there's all kinds of more scriptures on sowing and reaping the whirlwind remember though Matthew 13 where the Jesus telling the parable of the four kinds of ground which seed fall upon and he said the enemy no he said the field is the world and the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sowed them is the devil the harvest is the end of the world and the Reapers are angels so bro Graham preaches a message called the seed of discrepancy and so Satan is the one who's responsible for all these seeds these seeds that produce fruit of Lies right all these seeds of a discrepancy that people believe and we know it's from him now I want to move to the next thought that Matthew 25 with the parable of the talents let's go there Matthew 25 24 this was a pretty fresh thought for me this morning I hope it I hope I can relate it to you the way it brought grace to my heart Matthew 25 24:00 this is with the unfaithful man who had just the one talent then he which had received the one talent came and said lord I knew that thou art a hard man reaping where thou hast not sown and gathering where thou hast not straud and I was afraid and went and hid thy tale in the earth lo there thou hast that is thine and his Lord said unto him thou wicked and slothful servant thou knewest that i reap where I sow not and gather where I have not strawed now God is righteous God is holy and God had these other men planting right god is the lord of the harvest he had other men planting for him and God the gentleman God would not reap where he did not sow this wicked servant had a wrong understanding about God praise the Lord he had a wrong understanding look at looking Burt if you go to Luke 19 22 it's a parallel passage Jesus says this and he saith on him out of thine own mouth will I judge thee so Jesus judges him for the wrong words that he says he says well I was just scared and I knew you gather where you reap where you don't sow and in other words he's saying you take fruit that doesn't belong to you and God is not a stealer God is not a thief so he's a wicked man he's a lazy man he didn't do nothing with the talent that God gave him for the kingdom of God are with me Church he refuses it and then he blames God on the day of judgment and Jesus says I'm gonna judge you by your own words he said thou wicked servant thou knewest see he didn't know that thou knewest that I was an austere man a hard man rough man that's what it means rough and hard taking up that I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow that's not God God whatever God sews that's what he reads say men are you with me Church God is faithful God's a righteous Lord of the harvest but see this last serving it's judge because he didn't obey the law of reaping and sowing and each one of us have a talent that we must we must be so into amen we must sell our talent whatever God's given to us whether it's mothering or fathering or preaching or whatever town singing whatever town we have we must so to that we must sow to righteousness and reap and mercy but this man refuses to invest what God has given him into the plan of God he refuses and breaks he just did he he puts his nose up at the law of reaping and sowing I don't have to do that and then I'm gonna blame God so it is a wicked thing to neglect the law of reaping and sowing in the kingdom of God he falsely accused God said God is not fair God is hard the Bible just said he's rich in mercy the Bible just said he's merciful slow to anger and this wicked servants whole attitude is God so he's so hard on us he saw harness is in fact it's the opposite he's so merciful upon us this wicked servants got the wrong idea he's got God all confused why because he's let Satan confuse him and he has not understood God God is rich in mercy and of course God requires faithfulness and of course we know what Jesus says he says now artists therefore that put my money to the exchangers and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury take therefore the talent from him and give it unto him which hath ten talents for unto every one that hath shall be given and he shall have abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath amen this is how much God values the law of sowing and reaping every man every woman here has some talent something we must apply we must our faith must invest in that ministry for the kingdom of God how many understand that God convicts him for his slothfulness his laziness he was too lazy with the kingdom of God and he made excuses like I was scared how could you be scared to use the money when it wasn't even your money it was God's money amen and that's what that's what Jesus would say today how can you be scared in your ministry when I'm the one who equipped you for your ministry oh yeah you shouldn't be scared because I'm the lord of the harvest I entrust in this town to you and I'll direct your pass if you just under seek my ways amen I'll direct you because I had enough confidence in you to entrust this talent this money unto you but we must be faithful with our money time talent ministries everything we have we must devote it all back to God and not neglect it but we must honor the law of sowing and reaping he was self-contradictory and that shows that sinners thoughts are hard towards God it's always God's fault though he's God didn't do this God didn't do that you're too hard you're too rough and yet God is completely perfect and just in his fairness there could be no more perfect or more fair judge there could be no no better judge than God Almighty and yet they're accusing him of having some corruption you're too rough you're too hard your fault and Jesus said I'm gonna judge you by your own words my goodness he says suppose I did reap where I sew no bro Jesus made us say maybe I do that he said yet there that's nothing to Defour I had sowed upon thee and the talent was my money which thou was entrusted with not only to keep but to improve I like that Jesus saying I've sowed into you and yet you're not willing to show what I've sowed into you o my church you know the Bible says the God in you is treasure in earthen vessels hallelujah amen God put something in you that's a treasure can you say amen to that you've got a treasure in you and you've got a invest in that you've got to improve that amen if you're a singer you got to be a better singer about loris if I'm a preacher I got to be a more dedicated word based preacher amen whatever you are if you're one new fast one who has gifts of white wisdom or knowledge or prophecy or tongues you've got invest in that and get better at that God requires it because he's entrusted you with this talent he sowed into you and now you got us so in to yourself you got so into the ministry God's given to you now the nominations kind of get this idea like they say oh you got to sow into this ministry like I had a brother walk up and give me $200 one time just last year he said I want to sow into your ministry and I was like oh thank you I put it right towards the Bible club there's so many Bible club I said I put that 250 right towards Bible club and about Botham Bibles and Amanjit cubes and all these things but they that that that idea goes around the churches I'm going to sow into this and that's a good giving us a good example of sowing it's a good example it's not the only example it's just one example now what's interesting church that we need to understand let's go to John chapter four is that we got to be patient because the lord of the harvest is patient remember James chapter 5 we're not going there right now but go to John chapter 4 James 5 said the lord of the harvest is very patient he waits for the fruit of the earth remember that we waits for the former latter rain let's go to John chapter 4 John chapter 4 verse 34 this is of course the chapter with the woman at the well but in between where Jesus discerns her spear and then when the City most of the city gets saved Jesus tells his disciples a little fact about sowing and reaping I would like for you to see it here this morning Jesus saying that my meat is to the will of him that sent me and to finish his work say not ye there are yet four months and then cometh the harvest behold I say and you lift up your eyes and look on the fields for they are white already to harvest and he that reapeth receiveth wages why cuz you get that food you go sell it for money right and gathers fruit unto life eternal that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together so whether you're the one that plants or you're the one that reaps everybody rejoices because every hat everybody had a part in the harvest everybody had a part in the the cycle of life right look at verse I hear something striking verse 37 and here it is a true saying one sows and another repo and church this is humbling for me because my ministry might be a sowing ministry what I mean what do you mean by that I mean this I may preach here for 40 years and I may not see a big harvest right like a song with brothers James Browning years ago and brother Samuel about that their church started really really humble didn't have much harvest at the beginning it was just within the last ten or fifteen years that they really had a lot of souls being saved when I talked with brother James brother Samuel they planted and planted for years and years and years look what Jesus says once knows another Reapers 38 I sent you to reap wherein he bestowed no labor my other men labored and your enter into their labors look at that the disciples didn't even do the planting work God just sent them out to harvest well the Amen what if we're here just to do the planting work could we trust God for that could we be still happy with God for that or do we have to see all the reaping a real Christian doesn't have to a real Christian just once and do what God has called them to do I remember brother Craig and Mel Brooks both told me that when they had those 50 Souls when I we were part of those 50 souls that came out there Lima he said brother Craig quoted this scripture and he said we entered into the labors of other men he thought about brother Branham and brother Eddie Bisco and brother Neville that administer there in Lima he said we entered into their labor that's a brother Craig said and that strike him for all those years they would preach out in the barn at brother Browns house Tom Brown or they preach in his living room have service in his living room but listen we're all gonna rejoice together amen when we cross over there's gonna be no big eyes or little use there's gonna be one who's the first among 10,000 that's Jesus Christ amen all of us others just gonna be arms around each other happy rejoicing huh get organiz to be the family of God we had a part in it we just must be faithful with our part my parts the plant helped me to plant or water remember the Bible said he who plants here waters their one I used an illustration a few weeks ago you see the guy at the landscaping company Jose see the guy give her water you water the plants that's me I'm just out there that's me when you see a landscape or water and just think of me I didn't really plant a lot of these souls here in Akron I mean a few of them yeah but I'm just watering I'm just watering I let those Spirit of God feed our hungry souls amen preaching the Word of God but there's only one who gives the increase Jesus Christ amen we must be faithful in planting and if we're faithful in planting then we'll certainly have a harvest if we are if we can be patient and wait upon the Lord amen don't be weary in well-doing and that's why it was an agriculture society in the Bible days to teach them you have to have faith remember the Bible said in Ecclesiastes The Fool say uh it's too cloudy to go out and plant today it's too windy I can't go out and plant today there's not enough rain I'm not gonna go plant and the Bible said a fool does that when the time comes to plant you got a plant right you got it you have to get to trust the process how many trust the process today amen of sowing and reaping we've got to trust the process that God has given to his people amen look now this just real we're not gonna read this but in 1st Corinthians 9 Paul talks about preachers and how their oxes and you must not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn and the Bible says if we have sown spiritual things in your lives is it a big thing if we reap your carnal things that should be the thoughts if the preachers are planting spiritual things in your life is it a big deal if they get your tithes and offerings you know your ties rather it's not a big deal because the spiritual seeds are more important than the carnal ones there's so valuable Paul says is it on the big thing if you just get a few bucks to live and you know make a living and something like that now of course people perverted it and they're millionaires you know that's a perversion but it's a little thing because these spiritual seeds that are being planted in our lives week after week are so incredibly valuable there are the seeds of God and they will bring forth in their season amen they return Oh hallelujah the word is eternal and it will produce something in their lives amen I see it my children now those seeds that they've heard over the years they're they're producing something in their lives they come up and bring me prayer requests on least expecting it and they come and pray for me or do different things talk about spiritual things all the time because these seeds are being planted in their hearts well so we all must have we almost let the seeds of God be planned in our hearts we got to be faithful go to second Corinthians chapter 9 synchronize chapter 9 mom wants get into where I need to go let me we said time for 15 minutes I used to preach an hour and a half on Sunday morning so praise the Lord just got to trust the process bro just to stretch us the process you have to finish every sermon just trust the process but I found this too you know the last two weeks I've only preached one sermon and it feels like the tap of God is running slower like if I know I've got to preach to service it's like the tap of God runs more I need I need two sermons Lord thank you and now I go once there was this much is that okay just coming real slow you know and it's true whatever you need of God will supply each Jehovah Jireh if you need two services I'll give you two services I found that to be true it's a law of God sänger in these nine now the background of this chapter is beautiful paul is kind of bragging on the corinthians because they wanted to help out some other believers with money with giving and the in chapter 8 we're not going to read it but the Macedonian churches which were Philippi Thessalonica and Berea they they came they became Christians in the Great Tribulation the Bible said but they still gave liberally to the Saints in Jerusalem and Paul was one of those that received their gift so these persecuted Macedonian poor Christians they gathered up whatever little they had and they sent it to Paul and Jerusalem and God said and Paul said that was a great sacrifice that you gave and the Corinthians now they had boasted or they had said that we're going to help some other church out and Paul's kind of reminding them you guys said you're gonna help that church out it's time to put your money where your mouth is go to verse 1 singer the a 9 verse 1 this is just a good reminder about church do we undo we remember how important is for us to give to others because we're planting seeds of righteousness Paul voted numerous chapters to his writing all about giving to other churches now we can say men but I wonder if I asked let's take up an offering for this list what if next week I say let's take up an offering who's ready to put their wallet where their heart is right because that's what Paul is asking them Paul said you said you were gonna give now I said make sure you give the Corinthians might have some trouble with gifts but they were real givers they had a giving heart and Paul honor them for that singer than his nine won for us touching the ministering of this to the Saints it is superfluous for me to write to you for I know the firmness of your mind for which I boast have you to them of Macedonia he would go to Macedonia mine these Corinthian believers their givers they just give all the time he would boast on them he's like I don't need to repeat this to you guys but he does for a reason he does it for our benefit that a ki was ready a year ago and your zeal hath provoked very many so when other churches saw how much the Corinthian church gave it made them zealous to want to give to yet have I sent the Brethren lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf that as I said you may be ready in other words it's time to put your money where your mouth is you said you're going to give your real generous Church and now it's time I sent them here to get your offerings less happy if they have methods don't Macedonia come with me and find you unprepared we'd that we say not ye should be ashamed in the same confident boasting in other words you better be ready to give you said you're going to give you better to be ready to give don't make promises that you can't keep don't be unprepared to give be ready to give verse 5 therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the Brethren that they would go before unto you and make up before hand your bounty wherefore where ever you had noticed before that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty and not as of covetousness look at verse 6 but this I say he which soweth sparingly shall also reap sparingly and he which soweth bountifully she also reap bountifully what a what a law of God I don't feel like I'm as blessed how come there's not as many blessings pouring out I don't know but you should check first how much have you how many seeds have you planted because your harvest would be a good indication of what you planted if you sow a little you're gonna get a little back if you give a lot you're gonna get a lot back how many can say amen to that he has to remind them little giving little harvest big giving big harvest every man according as he has purpose in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or necessity for God loves a cheerful message giver Amen God loves a cheerful Giver he loves it when people just give that's the purpose of my heart to give I just want to give God said I love that person I don't know about you but I want Jesus to love me I appreciate if you love me but I want Jesus Christ to love me so I want to be a cheerful Giver and God is able to see why because God is able to make all grace abound toward you if you give he's able to make it all come back to you but you've got you not have to trust the process as his written he hath dispersed abroad he hath given to the poor his righteousness remaineth forever in other words if you give to poor people nobody can ever take that away from you you've got treasures in heaven how they live you have my brother man so little time is devoted to storing up treasures in heaven verse 10 now he that men are ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food and multiply your seed sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness being enriched and every good and everything to all bountifulness which causes through us Thanksgiving to God they would just praise the Lord by these Christians are so generous they're willing to help out Macedonia they're helping out Jerusalem there this just makes us say thank you Lord that there are such generous people in this world amen now if you're real Christian your giving you don't expect it back that's a real Christian vows by the experiment of this administration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ and for your liberal see your freely distributing unto them and unto all men that's quite a statement not only did they quickly give to Christians they quickly gave to anybody and by their prayer for you which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you thanks being to God for His unspeakable gift Wow now powerful they would give this Macedonian Church would give and then after that after the money left for their a little bit more poor they'd pray and say God bless those Saints in Jerusalem god bless them and meet every need that they have these people were devoted to prayer they knew the laws of God if you give to God when you lend to the poor you lend to the Lord amen they knew it and yet they were poor people too it's not how much you give it's how much you give of what you have right church I just thought we'd go over that again sowing and reaping let me bring it down to close here I'll try to this one says I got seven minutes now that's that's interesting I'll just read a few quotes but man talks a lot a lot about reaping and sowing he talks about Abraham after Abraham got the victory over the four kings during that time and Genesis 14 that nelq as that came forth and gave him communion he said after the over my cousin it came out met Abraham gave him communion and some of you mothers I want you to notice something here - on the tithe paying now Levi was yet in the loins of Abraham when he met Melchizedek and the tie that Abraham paid to Melchizedek I who received ties paid ties for he was yet in the loins of Abraham when he met Melchizedek which was his great-great-grandfather wish I had enough time to preach here on sowing to the wind and reaping the whirlwind for you brother branham tide sowing to the winter it weeping the whirlwind into taifeng listen here that's what America's done he says way back long ago we had the old flapper man went over the flap around and Wednesday night the 1920s flapper of the roaring 20s today her daughter is a chorus girl her what's her daughter going to be next see what you do it bares something upon that your generations to follow you sin does visits two three and four generations and so does righteousness but Ram says live right it'll do something to your children to follow you on and on keep living right doing right separating yourself from the things of the world and live godly in this present world for Jesus Christ amen brother I'm context reaping and sowing to tithe giving and then to families we've got to live the life we've got to plant godly seeds before our children amen brother Branham said that John st. John recognized Jesus as the Messiah as Jehovah when he saw Jesus multiply the bread because the man he kind of dramatizes it and said when John was younger his mom would tell him stories about the Bible and how the manna would fall from heaven and John would look up at mama said does God have a lot of ovens in heaven is how he makes that man everyday and John's mom would say no John he's the Creator he can just multiply it because he's so powerful and then brother branham uses that to encourage us he says to tell more he said oh if we just take more time to tell our children Bible stories he said instead of Davy Crockett American history which huh me love American history I love American history I love it free some Valley Forge last July 4th he said I imagined you could go to this time and pick every little boy in this town and they all could tell me who Davy Crockett was but I bet there isn't 20 of them out of a hundred could tell you Jesus Christ was the son of God see that's just the American spirit moving through see and we find today that we've sold to the winds and we're reaping a world and that's exactly right he said but we ought to be teaching our children about Christ so see now he's getting into the generational aspects of how we have to sow the right seeds before our children and so God's Word into their lives praise the Lord I don't have time this spiritual amnesia one's really really long it's a really good quote I'm gonna close with this David thought I got about five minutes here let me those are this thought I listened to a sermon from a denominator I don't even know what you denomination was I just typed in I went on YouTube and just typed in whirlwind in the wind and a preacher come up here's a holiness preacher that I could tell he was preaching on closed and he was a holiness preacher and he had a good he had a good thing but he said the best example was David of sowing and reaping I thought that's a good thought so I went back and found my notes from two years three years ago and I preached out on David I had it some things remember before David and Bathsheba this took around took place around 10:35 BC he been King around thirteen years before this great sin she's probably between 40 and 50 years old that's what Scofield timeline says remember during these 13 years between the Uniting of the kingdom and this great sin with Bathsheba we read the following events David in a time of peace desires to build the Lord a house but Nathan assure him it's for Solomon so he's got peace all around him he's enjoying peace because he's actually reaping the benefits of all his Labor's right I mean oh the Bible said in the judges the Bible said God gave them peace when they defeated their their enemies God is going to give you peace if you can get the victory hey if you let Christ get the victory in your life you're gonna enjoy a season of peace hallelujah we're gonna be free from that there's gonna feel like your own spiritual cloud you're gonna feel like you're in heavenly places amen that's right church David then the subdues the Philistines and Moabites recovers the borders of Israel from the king of Zopa he also slew the Syrians and built Garrison's in Syria the Lord preserved him wherever he went David also built Garrison's and Edom and executed justice and judgment unto all his people he was faithful with every person judgment this is right this is wrong we're deciding this this is the judgment this is what stands he was impartial he was just true he was typing Christ David sought out any of Jonathan's seed in order to sow kindness to them and found Mephibosheth whom he calls the drone Jerusalem and he continually bred from the king's table glory remember David was undefeated remember that when he inquired to the Lord we have to balance it out because there's times Balaam inquired the Lord and he got the he got the the permissive will of God because he went inquiring with the wrong attitude he went there saying oh I hope God will let me get the money from King Barrack so we just can't say well I prayed about it brother Jesse I know I'm right you've got to pray with a neutral heart say Lord let your will be done not my will that's what David did Lord should I go open and take over sick Lag remember that should I go up and take your sick leg and the Lord said go take it you're getting all the blessings you're going to recover everything every oh you're gonna get back and he did it at the command of the Lord after prayer so see we must inquire the Lord but have the right attitude when we inquire the Lord David tried to show kindness to the ammonites after the death of the king because the king had helped him when he was running from Saul now at the bottom I put it may have seen David was invincible but no man is here's what David reaped after he sowed sin see even even Roe we say even the highest level of a Christian even the most mature Christians can make mistakes David was the wise virgin for his day nobody lived a higher life than he didn't David had to have this all planned out with Bathsheba that lust memory or with that lust what was was just moving now I heard something near there's my timer but I heard that Bathsheba was related to one of his counselors he was like a granddaughter of one of his wise counselors so one of his main counselors so he had seen her before there was some he had this all planned out because that's what sin is right think about it when you fall sure our people fall short oftentimes don't people plan to do that they're planning the sin they want to do and so David neglects the barrel in second Kings 11:1 yet your riah's heart was centered around the battle in that striking church I wonder this morning I wonder how many people actually see the battle going on today David says I've got so many victories I've been coasting I'm almost invincible I don't need to go out and have a battle I don't go out and try to win souls I don't have a prayer in my house I don't have to fight for these things he stopped battling he stopped trying to get victories in Christ he just put it on coast maybe he parked he just parked in lust I'll say like that he couldn't see the battle that was going on when we come to church do we see the battle going on when we go all when you go to your home tonight ask yourself am I seeing the battle because David after all these victories he just put it on coast he just got kind of lukewarm and everybody else is out there battling but his heart had left the battle I wonder where our hearts at because the Bible said wherever your heart is it's where your treasures at what's our treasure today what would be the greatest treasure we could have today it had to be something spiritual it have to be treasures laid up in heaven helping other people everybody see that so he planned out this adultery he calls Uriah back and he says Uriah going on and see your wife and rerai says i'm how can i think of this this relationship how can I think of this physical relationship when all my friends are out there fighting for their lord's army amen his heart was so into the battle he couldn't even joy a lawful pleasurable act with his wife I can't even think about that I'm in battle mode amen oh god help us to be in battle mode this morning amen help us be in battle mode when we leave here how can I do pleasurable things for my flesh all the time there's a battle going on and that's when David planted this adultery in his heart when he couldn't see the battle anymore Oh everybody's going to heaven everybody's being saved and yet people are probably dying and going to hell all the time couldn't see the battle left the battle no longer fighting for the things of God how many want to fight for things of God it was the season this is the time and season to seek God this is the time and season to go fight for the things of God and he neglects the time and season of God I'm just going to coast I'm just going to relax I got my eye on this little girl then he goes out there what happened she's bathing which is where BAM said I was wrong for her to do that they seemed like they had it kind of I don't know I've seen may have been planned out we don't know for sure but we know one thing he was neglecting the battle and I wonder if we're seeing the battle today David member Nathan comes and says there's a man that took out another man's lamb and David said he's going to restore him fourfold and isn't it interesting the very judgment David lays on this man gets laid on himself four of his sons died he said this he's gonna pay him back four fold and he lost the baby from that the first baby from Bathsheba Amnon Absalon and had an idea all died because of his own judgment the word that came out of his own mouth in that striking Church whatever I'm in so's that shall he reap that's striking and then what happened to him now remember dave was invincible Church he hadn't lost in a long time and it was one lust one moment one sin all planned out at all he ran past every red light every red light every red light because he wasn't battling anymore it wasn't fighting the battle we all know there's a battle but are we fighting in the battle or trying to cast out against are we fighting against spiritual wickedness in high places or we coming in prayer to Almighty God coming against spiritual wickedness all around or is there just no battle or we just going to church and smiling everybody and which is good I'll smile you but are we battling for the spiritual victories of God that's right his daughter got raped by his own son Absalom had a conspiracy against his own father he lost the kingdom for a while then David the the people he Satan encouraged him to number the people and thousands people died in a plague because of David and then Adonai at the end of his life tried to take the throne from Solomon but of course Bathsheba interceded their God had her in her seat let's end our feet remember brother Branham at the very height of his ministry in the 50s he went to South Africa and the Holy Spirit said I'm giving you this country but what happened he felt the very height of that discernment he took the invitation of the denominational x' and the holy spirit said you'll pay for that he reap what he sowed every man and god every man of God every woman of God we have to reap what we sow and the Bible says so to righteousness so to righteousness praise the Lord I want to make sure I don't miss something here as we close her weekend as we said last last Sunday - like the rich young ruler Jesus looked at his character man this man was a character he was approaching a pinnacle that rich young ruler would have kept going up with more character Jesus loved him look at David this character character character character then all of a sudden one bad decision caused all this whirlwind never see that think of celeb think of millionaires think of athletes who have had everything going for them but then they reap what they sow think of Tiger Woods he's the clearest example said all those records yet he was committing adultery on his wife all those years and it finally caught up with him he's never even got even close to winning since then because you reap what you sow never understand but the Bible says if we sow to righteousness we shall reap in everlasting life let's bow our heads for a moment here by the grace of God Heavenly Father we thank you for this time Lord God Lord were grateful for the laws that you place in this universe Lord and father we've just briefly looked at this law of reaping and sowing Lord I purposely wanted to close the David because he's one we'd all look up to David was after the heart of God he was seeking your heart after all those victories he had a weak moment Lord God and then reap the whirlwind father I want to offer you thanks for your word Lord for your grace to us Lord that we can hear these things and learn from them today to God I pray for every person here Lord God they would realize what you have sowed into their life as we saw with the parable
