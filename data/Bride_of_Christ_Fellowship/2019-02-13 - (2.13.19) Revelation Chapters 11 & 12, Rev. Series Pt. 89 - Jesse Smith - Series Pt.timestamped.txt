[27:13] [Applause]
[27:22] [Music]
[27:32] oh he's alone let's take our Bibles here
[27:43] let's go to Revelation chapter 11 like
[27:45] to look at a couple more chapters
[27:47] tonight or willing we look at Revelation
[27:49] chapter 11 and chapter 12
[28:05] revelation 11 here chapter 11 verse 1
[28:09] such as reverses 1 & 2 par me
[28:37] praise the Lord
[28:38] revelation 11 1 & 2 verse 1 and there
[28:43] was given me a reed like unto a rod and
[28:45] the angel stood saying rise and measure
[28:47] the temple of God and the altar and them
[28:51] that worship therein but the court which
[28:55] is without the temple leave out and
[28:57] measure it not for it is given unto the
[29:01] Gentiles for the Holy City shall they
[29:04] tread under foot forty and two months
[29:08] now I just had that thought let's go to
[29:10] Luke 21 here she reminds me a little
[29:14] scripture I read I believe yesterday
[29:16] Luke 21:24 I believe yes
[29:36] now what's striking is that this was
[29:38] spoken 2000 years ago
[29:40] and it's still being fulfilled and will
[29:43] shortly come to pass maybe in our
[29:46] lifetime maybe in the next maybe the one
[29:48] after that we don't know it's amazing
[29:52] that Jesus Christ's words are still rock
[29:55] solid amen
[29:57] every word he said still being fulfilled
[30:01] praise God
[30:02] verse 24 let's read this one together on
[30:04] three Luke 21:24 one two three and they
[30:09] shall fall by the edge of the sword and
[30:12] shall be led away captive into all
[30:14] nations and Jerusalem shall be trodden
[30:17] down of the Gentiles until the times of
[30:21] the Gentiles be fulfilled amen
[30:24] let's have a word of prayer for
[30:25] everything on your heart just make it
[30:26] under to God here tonight imagine I'll
[30:28] be doing teaching but of course the Holy
[30:30] Spirit come down here and minister to
[30:32] other needs outside of this teaching
[30:34] text here Heavenly Father we love you
[30:37] tonight Lord God who are your servants
[30:39] we just want your will to be done
[30:40] Heavenly Father or we love you and we
[30:43] love your word father there's nothing we
[30:45] love more than
[30:45] your word worshipping you singing to you
[30:48] Lord sitting here in heavenly places for
[30:50] this is a foretaste of the glory divine
[30:53] Lord God that will experience shortly we
[30:56] believe dear God we believe your coming
[30:59] is near we know it we don't know when
[31:01] but we know it's it's nearer than when
[31:03] your prophet was here on the scene
[31:05] speaking with us say at the Lord so god
[31:07] help us to make ourselves ready Lord as
[31:09] we sing that song trim our lamps Lord
[31:12] God give us back to our first love Lord
[31:14] God father may you be glorified here
[31:17] tonight in Jesus Christ's name the
[31:19] church said Amen god bless you didn't
[31:21] see the praise the Lord well I didn't
[31:31] know it was Beatrice the birthday this
[31:32] week so it's giving around flaws praise
[31:34] the Lord I guess it was written in here
[31:38] I didn't I didn't check it in here so
[31:39] let me take just a moment here February
[31:44] 12th yesterday okay well Lord bless you
[31:47] sister and we sure appreciate you a bed
[31:51] hallelujah it's just so nice you can be
[31:55] here you know the Lord has certainly
[31:56] directed your path and you've just been
[31:59] a real godly example to everybody so
[32:00] thank you sister you should appreciate
[32:03] how you love your family and you love
[32:04] the Lord just though you're almost very
[32:07] special person you're a child of the
[32:10] King and we're glad to have this time
[32:13] with you praise the Lord so I have just
[32:18] a few slides here and then we'll look at
[32:25] these two chapters here by the grace of
[32:27] the Lord someone look at
[32:32] these two chapters done here tonight and
[32:34] then that will catch us up a little bit
[32:38] to finishing it's been my goal and
[32:40] desire to preach the whole book of
[32:43] Revelation so I get through these two
[32:46] I'll be over halfway done by the grace
[32:48] of Lord so it's nice to see the
[32:50] landmarks along the way praise the Lord
[32:52] and of course as we read last week you
[32:54] know this is what brother Branham wished
[32:55] he could have done he said he could have
[32:57] wished he could took four months in a
[32:58] row and just preached straight through
[33:00] he said all the revelations and the book
[33:02] of Revelation he said would have been a
[33:04] little heaven to him so this is a little
[33:06] heaven for us I'm about you but after
[33:08] all the trials of the world and all the
[33:10] battles of the day this is a little
[33:12] heaven to me I hope it is to you as well
[33:14] being in the presence of the Lord Jesus
[33:16] and with the Saints here so I'm skipping
[33:18] ahead let me get to my notes here okay
[33:22] here we are
[33:23] now just remember if there's any chapter
[33:26] if there's any questions you have on
[33:27] these chapters as we go through please
[33:28] you know send me a text or send me an
[33:30] email and we had brother Johnny his
[33:33] family here last time we turn on
[33:34] revelation 10 and he came out of service
[33:36] saying that was wonderful brother Jesse
[33:38] says we just love the teaching there and
[33:40] he said you know so often you know I
[33:43] don't know what's going on in every
[33:45] church but he said so often you know
[33:46] preachers will just preach and they'll
[33:48] shout know yell but they don't really
[33:50] get maybe to teach in things so that
[33:53] really encouraged me you know that we
[33:54] just want to we want to understand you
[33:56] know if someone asks you a question
[33:57] isn't a blessing to be able to say well
[33:59] you know the Bible says right here you
[34:02] know you know sisters can have words of
[34:06] knowledge too you know gifts of
[34:08] knowledge right just because the sister
[34:09] shares the scripture doesn't mean she's
[34:11] preaching on it right so there there is
[34:15] little gifts in there too and so we
[34:17] thank the Lord for that and I feel just
[34:21] brought that back to me Luke 21:24 so
[34:24] let's go back there Jesus is actually
[34:28] teaching or prophesying on titus coming
[34:33] in verse 23 he said but woe unto them
[34:36] that are with child and to them that
[34:38] give suck in those days for there should
[34:41] be great distress in the land and wrath
[34:42] upon this people he was speaking of
[34:44] Titus coming
[34:46] remember Titus surrounded them and I
[34:50] think starved him out basically he
[34:52] starved him out and then he went in and
[34:54] slaughtered him and Josephus said it was
[34:56] awful it's like rivers of blood were
[34:58] pouring out of the temple down the
[35:01] temple steps you know it was just it was
[35:03] just awful and so jesus said woe to them
[35:06] you know he said he said as soon as you
[35:08] see those armies he said run to the
[35:10] mountains he said don't look back don't
[35:11] take anything just to run and Josephus
[35:15] also said by history there was not one
[35:18] Holy Ghost field Christian or he called
[35:20] him Christians there was no Christians
[35:22] in the city when Titus did that because
[35:25] Jesus had warned them about that and
[35:27] Titus said they were out three or four
[35:30] years before I'm sorry
[35:31] Josephus said the Christians were out
[35:33] three or four years before Titus even
[35:34] came because Jesus they took the heed of
[35:38] Jesus and said that destruction Jesus
[35:40] knew and told them destruction was
[35:42] coming so you must flee and so all the
[35:45] Christians got out before destruction
[35:47] came and that's a beautiful type Church
[35:49] that every age God has not given his
[35:52] children over to wrath or judgment God
[35:54] has had mercy on his children you can
[35:57] take that all the way back there Enoch
[35:59] was three generations before the flood
[36:01] came Enoch walked with God and God took
[36:04] him off the earth and even Noah who's a
[36:07] type of the foolish virgin even God
[36:09] spared him from the wrath of God did he
[36:12] hear the shouting probably did he hear
[36:13] the screams and the blood-curdling cries
[36:15] probably but he himself found grace in
[36:18] the sight of the Lord and that's what I
[36:20] believe will happen to the foolish
[36:22] version during the tribulation because
[36:24] remember the Bible said there's coming
[36:25] an hour of temptation where they're
[36:27] gonna lay down the mark of the beast and
[36:29] all those who won't take it will have to
[36:32] be killed right because they cannot buy
[36:33] or sell so I personally believe that's
[36:35] what's going to happen the foolish
[36:37] virgin have to give their lives at the
[36:39] beginning of the Great Tribulation and
[36:41] they won't maybe see the seven trumpets
[36:44] or the seven vials or the three woes
[36:46] perhaps they won't see that because
[36:48] they're going to get stamped stamped out
[36:51] or stomped out at the beginning because
[36:53] that fits the type Noah had to go
[36:55] through it and suffer a little bit and
[36:57] feel the pressures of it here the rain
[37:00] for 40 days I wonder are we ever going
[37:03] to get to go through the pressure of it
[37:05] but maybe not suffer like the rest of
[37:08] them and so I just believe that seems to
[37:10] fit the pattern of God's Word look at
[37:12] Lotte he's a foolish virgin did he feel
[37:15] the heat maybe behind of Sodom no doubt
[37:18] but God even had mercy on him and so it
[37:22] be merciful for the foolish virgin to
[37:24] die when the marks being laid down to be
[37:28] merciful them to die there rather than
[37:30] have to go through the trumpets as we
[37:32] saw a few weeks ago and run into caves
[37:34] and you can't die or to be hunted down
[37:37] by scorpions for five months and you
[37:39] can't die there's there's no way to do
[37:41] it because of insanity and and the
[37:44] spiritual condition that'll be over the
[37:46] people at that time there'll be no holy
[37:48] spirit can you imagine the mind battles
[37:50] you'd have without the Holy Spirit right
[37:53] because there's no more you know what
[37:55] once he once he pulls that it's gone
[37:57] from the Gentiles the spirits gone and
[37:59] now it's gone all back to Israel back to
[38:01] the Jews so it's it's an awful time but
[38:05] Jesus tells them about this and warns
[38:09] them and in every age God had mercy amen
[38:12] God had mercy on the true believer now
[38:15] look at verse 24 again let's go back
[38:17] again Luke 21:24 and they shall fall by
[38:20] the edge of the sword and should be led
[38:21] away captive into all nations and
[38:23] Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the
[38:25] Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles
[38:28] be fulfilled what up you know what a
[38:29] prophecy here the Gentiles we're gonna
[38:34] have control over Jerusalem until their
[38:38] time is fulfilled and they still have it
[38:40] you know the Dome of the rock is still
[38:42] there I've never been to Jerusalem but I
[38:43] see it on pictures all the time the Dome
[38:46] of the rock is still there the Muslim
[38:47] shrine is still there the Gentiles
[38:51] control that area for the most part that
[38:54] tent that Temple Mount right and Jesus
[38:57] said it's going to be that way until the
[38:59] time of the Gentiles be fulfilled now we
[39:02] all got excited when when the president
[39:04] said you know he's bringing the embassy
[39:07] back to Jerusalem that's a good sign it
[39:09] looks like it's getting closer
[39:11] looks like we're getting closer but now
[39:14] heading back with this in mind when you
[39:16] head back to revelation 11 this is one
[39:19] time brother Branham said the sat the
[39:20] Lord twice he said about Israel as I
[39:22] preached a few years ago there's two
[39:25] times he said thus saith the Lord about
[39:27] Israel he said thus saith the Lord
[39:29] Israel will rebuild their temple he said
[39:31] it's thus saith the Lord according to
[39:33] the Bible and that's where we start here
[39:35] revelation 11 verse 1
[39:37] there's given John a reed like a rod
[39:41] that angel said rise and measure the
[39:43] temple of God and the altar and them
[39:46] that worship therein now isn't it
[39:48] something God give that rod to a
[39:51] preacher to measure and just see what is
[39:55] the size of this and and how what
[39:57] examine the people doesn't that fit the
[40:00] spiritual the spiritual thing of what
[40:02] God does doesn't God give the ability of
[40:04] a preacher to kind of see the
[40:06] congregation understand their size and
[40:08] and where they are aren't you glad God
[40:10] does that God doesn't preach half of
[40:13] your preacher or the pastor or preachers
[40:15] preach way over your heads you can't
[40:17] understand it if they do maybe they got
[40:19] off the spirit one day but they know it
[40:22] they out they understand the condition
[40:24] of the church and able to minister right
[40:26] to it and see if we're measuring us to
[40:29] see where we measure to the things of
[40:31] God that's right
[40:34] but look John is given the measuring
[40:37] stick for this and notice the Bible said
[40:43] the temple of God is built so revelation
[40:46] 11 the temples now rebuilt it's not
[40:49] rebuilt right now so this is something
[40:53] that's going to happen we believe soon
[40:55] maybe in our lifetime Church if it gets
[40:58] started pretty soon you're gonna see all
[41:00] of us well if you're not dancing I'll be
[41:02] dancing all over this church because the
[41:05] Bible said the Gentiles will control
[41:08] that until the time of the Gentiles be
[41:12] fulfilled we don't know if they're going
[41:14] to start building it before the rapture
[41:15] or right after the rapture I'd imagine
[41:17] before that's what I believe and I
[41:22] believe that because here John sees em
[41:24] and he sees Pete
[41:25] in the in the court or the temple rather
[41:28] worshiping their worshipping and their
[41:32] Jews right so they will be killing
[41:35] animals for three and a half years while
[41:38] the two prophets are ministering them
[41:40] they'll be killing animals and
[41:41] worshiping there in the temple I believe
[41:43] for three and a half years and then at
[41:45] the end of that after they see the
[41:47] rapture then Jesus comes back where the
[41:49] man says in the church age book so if
[41:53] God leaves the Gentiles that spirit goes
[41:55] off them and it goes on the Jews to get
[41:57] everything right with the law and the
[41:58] word I would imagine if they're gonna
[42:00] worship there they'd have to have that
[42:02] temple already built wouldn't that
[42:04] encourage your faith if you see the
[42:05] temple being rebuilt and the Muslim Dome
[42:09] it'd have to be demolished I'm not sure
[42:11] I'm not sure how maybe yeah maybe the
[42:14] Israelite government will do that I
[42:15] don't know maybe they'll destroy it
[42:17] I'm not sure but the Jesus Christ said
[42:21] it'll be trodden down of the Gentiles
[42:23] until the Gentile dispensation is over I
[42:26] don't understand why people can say
[42:28] there's no dispensation as there's no
[42:29] dispensation in the Bible there is Jesus
[42:32] Christ says it right here there's times
[42:34] of the Gentiles God as a
[42:35] dispensationalist amen God gives a time
[42:38] God gives a season the Bible said to
[42:41] everything there's given a time and
[42:44] season amen
[42:45] there's given a time and season where
[42:47] this prayer is gonna be answered there's
[42:49] another time a season when another
[42:51] prayer is gonna be answered amen
[42:52] we've just gotta have patience and
[42:55] endure the times and seasons and let God
[42:58] work everything out so God gets all the
[43:00] glory amen
[43:02] you know we always get we always you
[43:04] know say how Dave you know try to do God
[43:06] a service without being his will and
[43:08] that's true he did that and use use that
[43:12] lost his life remember he was only three
[43:14] months off the right season a church I
[43:17] know some bad things happen there the
[43:19] man lost his life but he was only off
[43:21] three months now what if we could only
[43:24] be all three months
[43:25] what if we're only three months off from
[43:27] the rapture wouldn't that be a pretty
[43:28] good thing I would think so not that
[43:31] we're trying to guess but what I'm
[43:33] trying to say is that we should be so
[43:35] close in God's presence and so close in
[43:38] our walk with the Lord
[43:38] that we should feel it's almost the time
[43:41] it's almost the season praise God you
[43:44] only missed it by three months ah and
[43:48] that's what we're saying here he was
[43:50] feeling I need a new gotta service I
[43:52] need to bring this Ark back I need to do
[43:55] this i nee and he only missed it by
[43:56] three months that's pretty good if you
[43:59] ask me I don't know about you that'd be
[44:01] pretty good three months now look at
[44:06] this year they have a temple and most
[44:09] one they have an altar and they have
[44:11] worship going on ah verse 2 but the
[44:16] court which is without the temple leave
[44:18] out and measure it not for it is given
[44:22] unto the Gentiles so see the the altar
[44:27] there the holy place and the place of
[44:29] the Gentiles will have to get under
[44:32] control that's why I believe there have
[44:33] to build the temple there of the green
[44:35] build that back but then they're still
[44:37] gonna have a court of the Gentiles like
[44:38] they did in the days of Herod King Herod
[44:41] they had a court of the Gentiles that
[44:43] was the big court on the outside and
[44:45] then they had the holy place right then
[44:48] after the court of women and the court
[44:49] of the Jews and then they had the holy
[44:51] place and the host of Holies
[44:53] but God but God tells him here so even
[44:55] in the time of the tribulation the
[44:57] Gentiles will have this Opera court of
[44:59] the Gentiles he said don't measure that
[45:01] he's to just measure the part that the
[45:03] Jews are gonna worship it ain't hey
[45:05] they're gonna get their temple back
[45:07] they're gonna get their altar back
[45:08] they're gonna get their worker back its
[45:10] thus saith the Lord according to the
[45:12] Bible right first woman to don't measure
[45:17] that part for its giving of the Gentiles
[45:19] and the Holy City shall they tread under
[45:22] foot forty and two months
[45:23] that's forty two months is three half
[45:25] years right 36 months is three years and
[45:29] then you have the half okay now that's
[45:33] verses 1 & 2 now that's the major theme
[45:36] right here is the Jewish temple of God
[45:39] is being rebuilt now verse 3 is where we
[45:44] we see now these two witnesses these two
[45:47] prophets Moses and Elijah we believe it
[45:51] could of course be just two men that
[45:52] the spirit upon them but I believe it'll
[45:54] be the two men now verse three and I
[45:57] will give power unto my two witnesses
[45:59] and they shall prophesy a thousand two
[46:01] hundred and threescore days clothed in
[46:04] sackcloth so three and a half years and
[46:06] it even tells us what kind of clothes
[46:07] they're gonna wear sackcloth it isn't
[46:10] gonna be silk garments like all these
[46:12] priests and prophets and evangelical
[46:15] charismatic Pentecostal rich guys right
[46:18] sangmi silk garments it's gonna be sack
[46:21] cloth praise God they're gonna be humble
[46:24] they're gonna look humble they're not
[46:26] gonna look rich and famous they're not
[46:28] going to be a prosperity gospel they're
[46:30] gonna be of the original gospel that's
[46:33] right
[46:33] they're gonna be humble but they're mean
[46:35] filled with power praise God amen verse
[46:39] three now verse 4 these are the two
[46:42] trees and the two candlesticks standing
[46:43] before the god of the earth like this
[46:47] verse 5 and if any man will hurt them
[46:49] fire proceedeth out of their mouth and
[46:51] devoureth their enemies and if any man
[46:53] will hurt them he must in this manner be
[46:55] killed now brother man tells us in the
[46:56] fifth seal he says this is not literal
[46:59] fire he said it's the word so there
[47:01] speak the word and it's going to come
[47:03] out like fire the word is going to burn
[47:05] like fire
[47:06] it's in other words it's going to take
[47:07] effect whatever the prophets said it's
[47:10] going to come to pass that's right and
[47:14] this is a perfect time to lay trim
[47:16] remind us of that scripture where David
[47:19] said touch not mine anointed and do my
[47:21] prophets no harm see right right now God
[47:25] is so merciful right church that people
[47:27] can speak against brother Branham they
[47:29] can blaspheme brother Branham and
[47:30] nothing happens to him seemingly you
[47:33] I've seen videos where people have
[47:34] blasting God and said if there's a God
[47:36] in heaven strike me dead now they just
[47:38] keep living see God is so merciful right
[47:41] now I don't then don't misunderstand me
[47:43] they're gonna suffer and pay for that
[47:45] eventually every either word spoken will
[47:48] be given account of but here at this
[47:52] time there's no more mercy amen there's
[47:56] no more mercy it's like going back to
[47:59] the law right and so if anybody harms
[48:02] one of those two prophets they are power
[48:04] of the word to speak it and
[48:06] judge them right there and harm them if
[48:08] they try to harm God's servants all
[48:12] right and people today don't understand
[48:14] how much mercy there is but there's
[48:16] mercy for you and I thank God for that
[48:18] now I just want to read this quote here
[48:21] to you from questions answers on the
[48:23] seals according to the opening of the
[48:25] fifth seal Moses and Elijah have to die
[48:27] what about Enoch he said I don't know if
[48:30] I don't know I'm just going to tell you
[48:31] I don't know I don't know all the
[48:33] answers folks I just want to read this
[48:35] because my man tells us he doesn't know
[48:37] everything I don't know and if I don't
[48:40] know I'm gonna tell you I don't know if
[48:41] I do know I won't tell you till I know
[48:43] see but I don't know I'll often wonder
[48:46] that myself there was a knock I see
[48:48] Moses come and Elijah comes back and
[48:49] they're killed see but now Enoch was
[48:52] translated before time I've often
[48:54] wondered their thought and wondered
[48:55] myself well what what about that but
[48:58] then here's the only consolation I can
[49:00] say is this that now notice Moses only
[49:03] serve God 40 years see he was 120 but
[49:06] twenty years the first 40 I mean he was
[49:08] getting his education the second 40 God
[49:11] was taking it out of him and the third
[49:13] 40
[49:14] he served God but Enoch walked five
[49:16] hundred years before God was blameless
[49:18] see so Moses comes back to serve some
[49:21] more time him and Elijah sober man
[49:25] thinks it'll actually be Moses and
[49:26] Elijah the two men to come back from
[49:29] heaven right because they came down from
[49:30] heaven to meet Jesus I'm out
[49:32] Transfiguration
[49:33] they got raptured back up right and then
[49:36] they come down again my man says to be
[49:38] those same people so they can serve God
[49:39] a little longer on this earth they meant
[49:42] see every for every true believer
[49:43] whether your desire just more time to
[49:46] serve the Lord just do something for the
[49:48] Lord that's why I love getting up in the
[49:49] morning yeah I'm tired sometimes
[49:51] yeah I'm a little cranky sometimes but
[49:53] when I finally wake up all I want to do
[49:55] is do something more for the Lord I'm
[49:57] gonna keep my health I'm gonna keep
[49:59] serving God better so that I can do more
[50:01] and share the light of Christ with more
[50:03] people that more people might know that
[50:06] I believe Jesus Christ is the same
[50:07] yesterday today forever I know most
[50:10] people are going to reject it I know
[50:11] most people who stomp it underfoot and
[50:13] trot it down and you know feel like
[50:15] we're casting our pearls before swine
[50:17] many times like we talked about last
[50:19] it may feel like that but also they're
[50:21] got the answer and as and I'll be a
[50:24] witness that I try to share Jesus Christ
[50:27] with them hallelujah
[50:29] so Bob Arum says I think Moses and
[50:32] Elijah will have a little more time and
[50:33] he says I don't know everything now the
[50:36] reason one reason I read that of course
[50:37] that dealt with Moses and Elijah was
[50:39] because I saw a quote this week where
[50:41] our friends from Jefferson mill are
[50:43] using a quote where brother Ham says if
[50:45] you need any answers they're on the tape
[50:48] so see they take this quote and they
[50:50] make it sound like every single answer
[50:53] is on the tape but you've got to balance
[50:55] that quote out and you got to take it
[50:57] into context well the brand is referring
[51:00] to something that he's they're asking
[51:01] him there that answers on the tape but
[51:04] brother Branham says he doesn't know all
[51:06] the answers so see how slick and sly the
[51:09] enemy is he'll try to twist one quote
[51:12] and say well all the answers are on the
[51:13] tape well that's true for your that
[51:15] question but every answer to every Bible
[51:19] question was not on the tape because God
[51:22] doesn't let any man know all the answers
[51:24] only Christ and even then Christ doesn't
[51:26] know the day or the hour of his coming
[51:28] as far as his natural flesh does the
[51:30] spear inside of him no yes cuz that's
[51:32] God's Spirit right but the flesh
[51:34] destruction this flesh body does not
[51:37] know because it's under constraints
[51:39] right it's under limitations it's still
[51:42] a human body right and so I just want to
[51:45] balance that out so you know and just
[51:47] show how humble brother Adam was program
[51:50] never beaten meat himself on the chest
[51:52] like some people now I don't know who
[51:53] does it but I'm not calling anybody out
[51:55] but some people beat themselves on the
[51:57] chest to make it sound like they have
[51:58] all the answers well brother branham
[52:00] never was like that go see they say they
[52:04] follow brother Graham but they don't
[52:05] have the same spirit as brother branham
[52:06] are you think and that's just the Holy
[52:09] Spirit the spirit of humility now I want
[52:13] to go to this one too now I don't say
[52:14] that's right now look he even says I
[52:16] don't even say that's right about Moses
[52:17] and Elijah see I'm just giving you my
[52:19] thought just to say what part I don't
[52:22] know I really can't tell you what what
[52:24] happened there or what God will do now
[52:28] why can't people see this why can't they
[52:30] see that every word is not the state the
[52:31] Lord why can't
[52:32] they see that he's not God he doesn't
[52:34] have all the answers
[52:35] see now they asked him the next question
[52:39] what's the name that will be on the
[52:40] people of revelation 3:12 Jesus said I'm
[52:43] gonna give you a new name said I don't
[52:45] know he said give them a new name I
[52:48] don't know what it is see it'll be
[52:49] probably may know when we get there
[52:52] but I don't know what it is now see he's
[52:55] gonna do that see he give them a new
[52:57] name that they just know they themselves
[52:59] see all right let me go back to her so
[53:03] two questions in a row the Prophet tells
[53:05] you I don't know and I don't know
[53:08] because God hasn't let me know yet so
[53:12] just something real simple but I want to
[53:14] make sure I lay that in there because
[53:15] this week I heard that quote and people
[53:17] are using it the same well every answer
[53:18] is on the tape just press play
[53:20] don't get me wrong there's a lot of
[53:21] great answers on the tape some of all
[53:23] the answers everything I'm preaching
[53:25] that you know today about revelation 11
[53:27] and 12 is all I got from the tape
[53:29] everything okay but they're trying to
[53:33] make it say like every single answer to
[53:36] every single question is on the tape and
[53:38] that's not true that's not true because
[53:41] the brother branham said that now let's
[53:45] go to revelation 11 let's keep going
[53:47] here
[53:48] now verse sixth here verse 6 is where we
[53:51] see that it makes it seem like this will
[53:56] be Moses and Elijah because the
[53:59] ministries match let me pull the
[54:04] scripture there all right
[54:09] 6 these have power to shut heaven that
[54:12] it rain not in the days of their
[54:14] prophecy that's first King 17 1 remember
[54:17] that was Elijah's first recorded miracle
[54:19] he said thus saith the Lord do or water
[54:22] will not fall from the heavens until I
[54:24] call for it right and it lasted for
[54:28] three and a half years see so that
[54:32] matches the spirit of Elijah and have
[54:34] power over waters to turn them to blood
[54:37] that's Exodus 7 19 when Moses did that
[54:40] by the leadership of the Holy Spirit to
[54:42] turn them to blood and to smite the
[54:44] earth with all plagues as often as they
[54:46] will so whenever anyone tries to attack
[54:50] them they've got the word so since
[54:54] they're not in the days of grace uh
[54:56] since they're not the days the Gentile
[54:57] dispensation God gives them that power
[55:00] to protect themselves praise the Lord
[55:02] and they can just protect themselves
[55:04] with the word now the same thing is true
[55:05] for us spiritually we can just speak the
[55:07] word and it'll protect us we may have to
[55:10] suffer who may go through trials but the
[55:12] word we got to speak the word hang on to
[55:14] the word it's going to take effect
[55:16] praise God speak the way they've God but
[55:19] they have that literal instant right
[55:21] instant power if any man harms and they
[55:24] speak the word takes care of it
[55:27] these are mighty men of God mighty men
[55:30] of God by the Holy Spirit of course not
[55:32] by their own power
[55:33] so see verse 6 matches the ministry of
[55:37] Moses and Elijah verse 7 and when they
[55:41] shall finish their testimony so this is
[55:43] three and a half years so this finishes
[55:45] the last half of Daniels 70th week the
[55:49] last three half years the first half of
[55:51] the 70th week was already fulfilled in
[55:53] Jesus ministry there's only three and a
[55:55] half left or a second half of that 70th
[55:58] year so when that finishes that that's
[56:02] the end of Daniel 70 weeks verse seven
[56:05] the Beast that ascendeth out of the
[56:07] bottomless pit shall make war against
[56:09] them and shall overcome them and kill
[56:11] them
[56:11] so this beast must be Satan himself
[56:14] right so it must be all Satan's power
[56:17] this this Antichrist spirit or whatever
[56:20] is whether it's a separate spirit or
[56:22] Satan himself
[56:23] besa sends out and and then God allows
[56:26] these two servants to die now think of a
[56:32] think how humble that is for three and a
[56:33] half years they can keep everybody off
[56:35] them but then God allows them to die
[56:38] because God's gonna do something great
[56:40] coming up hey I didn't praise God gods
[56:43] do something great and people might look
[56:47] and say no doubt that means as Microsoft
[56:49] they lost their power haha
[56:51] they lost their gifts and God's saying
[56:53] just wait three and a half days right
[56:56] they're gonna be mocking and making fun
[56:58] look good they did and look over to spit
[57:00] on them in the file of my new out cards
[57:02] evil things but God always gets the last
[57:05] say praise the Lord see sin is only
[57:08] pleasurable for a season a shortened in
[57:10] a season but God will have the final
[57:13] word on everything
[57:14] that's right Church amen see he makes
[57:18] war against them and shall overcome them
[57:20] and kill them
[57:22] so God still lets them go through
[57:25] experience a humble death
[57:29] now Moses already died once but that
[57:32] would be Elijah's first time dying right
[57:33] if it is the actual man Elijah which I
[57:36] believe it will be because that would be
[57:38] enough to influence Israel to see my
[57:40] here's the man that wrote the law of
[57:41] Moses and here's the one that prophesied
[57:43] all the Israel and called fire down from
[57:46] heaven this has got to be right how can
[57:48] we deny the very one that gave us the
[57:50] law and the very one that vindicated the
[57:52] law to us now verse eight and their dead
[57:56] bodies shall lie in the street of that
[57:57] great city which spiritually is called
[57:59] Sodom and Egypt where also our Lord was
[58:02] crucified Jerusalem right Jerusalem
[58:05] where our Lord was crucified in that
[58:07] striking there a spiritual Sodom in that
[58:09] striking there not a physical Sodom
[58:11] there a spiritual Sodom which of course
[58:14] they were given over to abominations so
[58:16] Israel and the spiritual sense had been
[58:19] given over to abominations right and
[58:22] Israel the spiritual sense would have
[58:24] been guilty of much idolatry which was
[58:27] guilty of greed idolatry so this city
[58:30] was given over to spiritual Sodom sodomy
[58:33] and abomination it was given over to
[58:35] idolatry
[58:36] and God calls that lovely city he calls
[58:39] it spiritual Sodom and Gomorrah oh but
[58:42] wait - that new heaven and earth comes
[58:44] down amen he's going to say this ain't
[58:46] the old Jerusalem this is the New
[58:47] Jerusalem Amen Holly and then she'll be
[58:50] called faithful and chosen hahaha amen
[58:54] no more Sodom and no more Egypt but
[58:57] she's faithful now praise God because
[59:00] Christ's bride will be living there and
[59:02] this 144,000 and his eunuchs praise God
[59:05] right all the broad members and then all
[59:08] the bride servants praise God
[59:10] they'll all be living at holy New
[59:12] Jerusalem praise the Lord
[59:13] oh my thank you Lord so their dead
[59:17] bodies lie there
[59:18] verse 9 and they're the people and
[59:20] Kindred's and tongues and nations shall
[59:21] see their dead bodies three days and a
[59:24] half and should not suffer their dead
[59:25] bodies to be put in the graves now let
[59:29] me I want to look at a few notes I wrote
[59:31] down here make sure I got everything
[59:33] here that was verse feel like I am
[59:38] missing something here okay yeah verse
[59:41] nine
[59:42] now did you catch it nations how our
[59:45] nations going to see dead bodies now
[59:47] this is where brother man tells us he
[59:49] said you got to read between the lines
[59:50] on this verse this here shows the power
[59:53] of the internet and television right
[59:55] this is where you can read between the
[59:57] lines o nations are going to see this
[1:00:00] and then they're gonna send gifts to
[1:00:01] each other within three and a half days
[1:00:03] well they couldn't do that in the days
[1:00:05] of the Lord Jesus right you couldn't
[1:00:07] send a gift you wouldn't send somebody
[1:00:09] you go deliver it because they live
[1:00:12] right down the street right if you said
[1:00:14] it it wouldn't get there in
[1:00:15] three-and-a-half days right so this
[1:00:18] shows it has to be a future time when
[1:00:21] there's instant communication and quick
[1:00:23] gift-giving so you can get an Amazon in
[1:00:26] two days right so this is three half
[1:00:29] days that's plenty of time for Amazon to
[1:00:30] get the gifts there if they're still
[1:00:32] going during the Tribulation Period I'd
[1:00:34] imagine right the Bible said
[1:00:40] they should draw them up upon the earth
[1:00:41] shall rejoice over them and make merry
[1:00:43] and shall send gifts one to another
[1:00:45] because these two prophets tormented
[1:00:48] them that dwelt on the earth mine so
[1:00:51] it's complete torment these men brother
[1:00:53] band said they're gonna interrupt nature
[1:00:54] right they're gonna it's not going to
[1:00:57] rain they're gonna turn water to blood
[1:00:58] they're gonna call plagues as often as
[1:01:01] they want they're gonna see they're
[1:01:02] gonna power to kill any enemy that comes
[1:01:04] against them and it's going to be
[1:01:06] torment to the people of Jerusalem the
[1:01:08] unbelievers now not the Redman not the
[1:01:10] hundred forty-four thousand but it's
[1:01:11] going to be tormenting them see isn't
[1:01:14] that what the world is don't don't no
[1:01:16] sinners hate Jews they still hate Jews
[1:01:19] right sinners still hate Jews the
[1:01:22] majority of people despise the Jews and
[1:01:25] so when they see it on TV for three and
[1:01:27] a half years these men in sackcloth that
[1:01:29] every now and then they'll probably go
[1:01:30] back these holy rollers and look what
[1:01:33] they're doing and look at the ruckus
[1:01:34] they're causing and they'll make them
[1:01:36] look bad they'll make them look bad for
[1:01:37] three and a half years they'll rejoice
[1:01:39] that these men have died the world will
[1:01:42] rejoice because they're tormenting them
[1:01:44] but they're commissioned by God to do it
[1:01:46] well where's all the love why are there
[1:01:48] preaching love weren't they preaching
[1:01:50] mercy because the days of mercy are over
[1:01:52] they had their chance that had received
[1:01:54] mercy today's the day of mercy praise
[1:01:57] God
[1:01:57] today's the day to see that the Roman
[1:02:00] Catholic Church is full of wickedness
[1:02:02] and adult and murders and abortions and
[1:02:06] abuse today is a day to see that that's
[1:02:10] right today's there's a to see that
[1:02:12] America's filled with evil murderous
[1:02:14] spirit murdering babies today's are
[1:02:16] there to see that today's the day the
[1:02:18] repent is that right today's a day but
[1:02:22] when since once the brides gone there's
[1:02:24] no more time
[1:02:25] today's a mercy or over its torment time
[1:02:30] today's the day to cry out to God for
[1:02:32] those things hallelujah and we do by the
[1:02:35] grace of the Lord amen see they make
[1:02:39] merry because the torment has stopped
[1:02:41] for three and a half days verse 11 and
[1:02:44] after three days and a half the spirit
[1:02:46] of life from God entered into them and
[1:02:49] they stood upon their feet
[1:02:53] and great fear fell upon them which saw
[1:02:57] them now church that's the same fear
[1:03:01] that those soldiers saw when the angels
[1:03:05] were there when Jesus resurrected right
[1:03:07] there was such great fear that the
[1:03:11] soldiers looked like they died the Bible
[1:03:12] said because of the the power of the
[1:03:15] Resurrection so here's another
[1:03:16] resurrection and great fear comes upon
[1:03:18] them see that's what God's fear does
[1:03:22] when God's fear begins to move when God
[1:03:24] starts doing miracles like that the
[1:03:26] sinners get all fearful right but their
[1:03:28] believer rejoices amen see they fear
[1:03:35] verse 12 and they heard a great voice
[1:03:38] from heaven saying unto them come up
[1:03:40] hither and they ascended up to heaven in
[1:03:42] a cloud and their enemies beheld them
[1:03:44] now that come up here there is the same
[1:03:46] come up hither that you saw revelation
[1:03:48] 4:1
[1:03:49] right when when God called up John to
[1:03:53] heaven after the seven church age so
[1:03:55] these words are important their rapture
[1:03:58] words amen
[1:03:59] hallelujah I wonder if we'll heal though
[1:04:02] hear those words Church come up here
[1:04:04] their bride come up hither brother
[1:04:07] so-and-so come up here their sister
[1:04:09] so-and-so I wonder if we'll hear those
[1:04:11] words because we know John heard them
[1:04:13] and we know the two prophets heard those
[1:04:15] exact words come up a little higher
[1:04:18] Amen come up higher praise the Lord and
[1:04:23] notice they go up in a cloud just like
[1:04:27] Jesus ascended to heaven in the cloud
[1:04:29] the Bible said a cloud took him up
[1:04:31] because this is the sixth and final
[1:04:33] rapture not seven not five 6 because 6
[1:04:37] is the number of anointed man in the
[1:04:40] head that's right praise God
[1:04:43] 6 raptures are not 7 they're 6 I've
[1:04:46] always been looking for number 7 but uh
[1:04:47] but there's 6 as far as I can see
[1:04:49] because 6 is the number of anointed man
[1:04:51] if you're going to go in the rapture
[1:04:52] you're going to be anointed
[1:04:54] what were they anointed with the spirit
[1:04:57] of life from God Amen Alleluia god's
[1:05:01] holy spirit of life raises their dead
[1:05:04] bodies takes them up in a cloud I should
[1:05:06] cut
[1:05:06] cloud of glory amen raises them up in
[1:05:10] the sight of them all I wonder if
[1:05:13] they'll catch it on their smartphones
[1:05:15] there won't be a need to do it really
[1:05:17] because they're just going to be
[1:05:18] tormented but they'll probably catch it
[1:05:20] there they'll try to text it and share
[1:05:21] it or something like that but don't
[1:05:23] matter God's gonna play all back later
[1:05:25] God's got one great smartphone he's
[1:05:26] recording all this song right and it's
[1:05:29] all uploading to heaven you can't erase
[1:05:30] it only your sins can you erase because
[1:05:33] that's under the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:05:34] amen thank the Lord for that that's the
[1:05:38] only video that's gonna be the lead and
[1:05:39] praise God there's all the sins we did
[1:05:41] it'll be forgiven uh-huh thank you Lord
[1:05:46] so great fear and a cloud a resurrection
[1:05:50] cloud like Jesus did and it's caught of
[1:05:52] ascension just like an axe chapter 1
[1:05:56] when Jesus ended the Bible said he'd
[1:05:58] send up in a cloud and the two angels
[1:05:59] looked at them and said why are you
[1:06:00] tearing here go to Jerusalem and be
[1:06:02] filled with the Holy Spirit now verse 13
[1:06:05] and the same hour was there a great
[1:06:07] earthquake and the tenth part of the
[1:06:11] city fell
[1:06:11] now that city is Jerusalem right a tenth
[1:06:15] of the city of Jerusalem falls that's
[1:06:20] interesting a tenth is a tithe I never
[1:06:22] thought about that till now a tenth of
[1:06:24] it falls and the earthquake were slain
[1:06:27] of men seven thousand and the remnant
[1:06:32] were affrighted and gave glory to the
[1:06:35] God of heaven that's interesting I never
[1:06:37] thought a tenth the tithe has to fall an
[1:06:40] earthquake kills 7,000 now later the
[1:06:45] next verse this says this is the second
[1:06:48] woe so the second woe is an earthquake
[1:06:51] after the rapture of those two witnesses
[1:06:53] 7,000 men died in the earthquake can you
[1:06:56] imagine the buildings that are following
[1:06:57] there in Jerusalem and then a third I'm
[1:07:01] sorry tenth of the city Falls a tenth of
[1:07:05] the city Falls and that's verse 14 the
[1:07:09] second woe is past and behold the third
[1:07:11] woe cometh quickly now church let me
[1:07:15] just say something here I want to say
[1:07:16] this with all humility if you look
[1:07:18] there's two quotes or brother Branham
[1:07:19] says the second
[1:07:20] is the Second World War now this is
[1:07:24] where I just disagree weather band never
[1:07:26] said it right in the seals or after the
[1:07:29] seals I felt like he was just you you
[1:07:31] know using that as the best teaching
[1:07:34] that he had the time but I think by
[1:07:36] reading this scripture right here we can
[1:07:38] see that the second low can't happen to
[1:07:40] after the two prophets are raptured up
[1:07:42] and I know I don't say that to hope you
[1:07:45] know I don't say it to sound smarter
[1:07:46] than brother branham I'm not smarter
[1:07:47] than him but like brother BAM said he
[1:07:49] doesn't have all the answers he was
[1:07:51] doing the best he could but one thing
[1:07:53] that we know the Spirit of God is
[1:07:55] supposed to direct us into all truth and
[1:07:58] I'm not gonna argue if someone wants to
[1:08:00] argue about dancing
[1:08:00] you don't believe brother Branham you're
[1:08:02] not saying what brother Ram said I had
[1:08:03] people tell me that this week saying I
[1:08:05] didn't you know they can email me or
[1:08:06] text me saying you were a sailor I said
[1:08:09] well not every word he said is thus
[1:08:11] saith the Lord you got to find a balance
[1:08:13] but one thing that is true is that the
[1:08:16] Holy Spirit will direct us to the Word
[1:08:18] of God and church this is a minor
[1:08:21] this doesn't even deal with the bride of
[1:08:23] Jesus Christ so what does it matter
[1:08:25] anyway you know why why should we get
[1:08:27] upset with people we're not I hope it's
[1:08:29] that if they get upset with us but this
[1:08:31] doesn't even deal with us
[1:08:32] we're already be in heaven out of a
[1:08:34] wedding reception amen ah yes we care
[1:08:37] about a 144,000 brethren but we're gonna
[1:08:40] be having communion with Jesus amen
[1:08:43] during this time and and then it doesn't
[1:08:45] even kneel with us so we should just be
[1:08:48] kind and pleasant right that's the real
[1:08:52] test right the real test is when you get
[1:08:54] in a trial are you gonna act like a lamb
[1:08:57] or a wolf that's when it comes to Humpty
[1:09:00] right you either got lamb nature or you
[1:09:03] got wolf nature and that's the best time
[1:09:07] to see which nature you have when
[1:09:09] somebody blatantly disagrees with you or
[1:09:12] calls you something or whatever more
[1:09:13] this week I got called rich young ruler
[1:09:15] on the email he said you're just a rich
[1:09:17] young ruler you're just going after
[1:09:18] popularity I thought well if I'm going
[1:09:20] after popularity I'm sure saying the
[1:09:21] wrong things cuz I'm gonna at least
[1:09:23] popular churches in the world right
[1:09:26] we're not growing and we're not busting
[1:09:28] at the seams and there's not
[1:09:30] millionaires in our church and we're not
[1:09:31] tickling the ears of millionaires to try
[1:09:33] to get there
[1:09:34] I said you really surely don't know me
[1:09:37] sir I appreciate your your I appreciate
[1:09:40] your comments but I don't think you
[1:09:42] really know me too well
[1:09:43] haven't made too many friends my
[1:09:45] preaching when I preached fact I lose
[1:09:47] most of them but they can call me what
[1:09:51] they want but I'm gonna say my dear
[1:09:53] brother in Christ because that's the
[1:09:56] kind of nature I've got a lamb
[1:10:01] you can kick me around you can push me
[1:10:04] around I'll just say in that right
[1:10:11] Church yeah I know there's time there's
[1:10:13] no game around there's times have a
[1:10:14] backbone but I'm not Apostle Paul like I
[1:10:17] call blindness down from heaven like
[1:10:20] Moran said how can you call blindness
[1:10:21] down when they're already blind I can
[1:10:24] what are you gonna do I'm not a prophet
[1:10:26] so what can I new Church I can either
[1:10:29] get in the sphere of the wolf or I can
[1:10:31] just be a meek little humble am I think
[1:10:35] I'll be like the lamb I'm not gonna
[1:10:39] fight where I'm not a fighter but at the
[1:10:43] same time am i earnest in contending for
[1:10:45] the faith yes I am that's why I'm
[1:10:47] standing where I'm standing but I don't
[1:10:51] want to let my flesh have the victory I
[1:10:54] don't want to walk in the flesh on it
[1:10:56] I'll start attacking that person I want
[1:10:58] to walk in the spirit and I just want to
[1:11:02] though I was a gave an answer to every
[1:11:03] man that asketh you with meekness and
[1:11:05] fear meekness is not you're not even a
[1:11:09] preacher you're the rich young ruler
[1:11:11] you're just a Judas you're just a wolf
[1:11:13] in sheep's clothing I really don't think
[1:11:15] that's a real meek spirit there right
[1:11:18] God give us grace to be meek that's at
[1:11:24] least the season of life I'm seeing
[1:11:25] right now I'm seeing just a lot more
[1:11:27] attacks and God is just testing my
[1:11:30] meekness he wants to see my program said
[1:11:33] he said are you gonna be a lamb or gonna
[1:11:35] be a wolf he said this we'll see what
[1:11:40] spirit is that that's on you all these
[1:11:42] trials that we go through so I just want
[1:11:45] to bring that out verse 14 that's just
[1:11:46] my like I said my opinion
[1:11:48] I can't see how the Second World War uh
[1:11:50] there was two witnesses raptured yeah
[1:11:53] Mohsen elijah I didn't see that in the
[1:11:55] Second World War I don't know about that
[1:11:56] I don't know if a tenth of the city was
[1:11:59] destroyed in World War two I I just
[1:12:01] can't make that fit okay I believe this
[1:12:03] is a future event I believe this is
[1:12:05] after the rapture so I'm just letting
[1:12:08] you know what I believe
[1:12:09] ee brother Brian was a prophet
[1:12:11] absolutely 100% with all my heart was he
[1:12:14] perfect no no prophet was outside of
[1:12:17] Christ so I just want to say that
[1:12:19] okay verse 15 now this is not the
[1:12:24] seventh angel brother man's ministry
[1:12:26] this is the 7/7 heavenly angels blowing
[1:12:29] the trumpet the heavenly trumpet that
[1:12:32] brings judgments verse 15 and the
[1:12:34] seventh angel sounded and there were
[1:12:35] great voices in heaven saying the
[1:12:38] kingdoms of this world have become the
[1:12:39] kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ
[1:12:41] and he shall reign forever and ever so
[1:12:43] this is the brother Aaron said this is
[1:12:45] the day of the Lord but man said the day
[1:12:47] of the Lord is when the days of man have
[1:12:49] ended so after the second world it's not
[1:12:53] gonna be very long to the Battle of
[1:12:54] Armageddon aim ahead because at the
[1:12:57] Battle of again Christ comes back and
[1:12:59] that's the end of all human kingdoms
[1:13:01] because he's coming back in a sword as a
[1:13:04] shower of his mouth and it divides all
[1:13:06] of them amen and the fowls of the air
[1:13:09] come and feast on their corrupting
[1:13:11] bodies and then fire burns over the
[1:13:13] earth and then we walk on the ashes on
[1:13:16] the wicked in the Millenium praise God
[1:13:18] amen so see God's letting them know the
[1:13:20] seventh angel sounding the seventh
[1:13:22] trumpet and it's almost time for the
[1:13:24] Battle of Armageddon verse 16 and the
[1:13:29] four and twenty elders which sat before
[1:13:31] God on their seats fell down their faces
[1:13:33] and workship God's they do it again so
[1:13:35] you see they found their face I think
[1:13:36] two or three times here in Revelation
[1:13:38] what do they say saying we give thee
[1:13:41] thanks O Lord God Almighty which art and
[1:13:44] wast and art to come because thou has
[1:13:46] taken to thee thy great power and s
[1:13:48] reign and that so humble of God God has
[1:13:50] been lettin Satan had all this power on
[1:13:52] the earth since Adam sold it out right
[1:13:55] satan's called the god of this world
[1:13:56] he's let him have the power all the time
[1:13:59] now some of the power of the governments
[1:14:00] of course guy but God
[1:14:01] everything God's been active in the
[1:14:04] church he's been acting the people but
[1:14:06] he's kind of give Satan a little bit of
[1:14:07] power but at this moment what's that
[1:14:10] seventh trumpet sounds God's taking all
[1:14:12] the power back you had your fun devil
[1:14:16] but now you're gonna get chained up in a
[1:14:17] chain of circumstance and cast in the
[1:14:19] bottomless pit for a thousand years amen
[1:14:22] Christ is going to step on in the earth
[1:14:24] and rule with a rod and iron you had
[1:14:27] your six thousand years now I'm gonna
[1:14:29] have my seventh day of peace now I'm
[1:14:31] going to have my millennial honeymoon
[1:14:33] with my sweet old wife amen
[1:14:35] that's right church amen and they're
[1:14:38] saying God's finally taking his power
[1:14:40] back to himself see cuz God likes to
[1:14:43] have a God likes to have an enemy amen
[1:14:46] God wanted us to overcome is that right
[1:14:48] God one day he knew Satan would be an
[1:14:50] enemy so he gave him a little power gave
[1:14:52] him the power the whole time God was
[1:14:54] gonna win the whole time it was never in
[1:14:56] question it might look like it was in
[1:14:58] question might have been tough
[1:14:59] during those later C in age but the
[1:15:01] Bible said Jesus was in the midst of the
[1:15:04] seven candlesticks for all seven Church
[1:15:06] ages amen in other words Jesus Christ is
[1:15:08] here right now it may not look like it
[1:15:11] but Christ is here amongst his bride he
[1:15:13] never leave us or forsake us
[1:15:15] he's standing in the myths of the layers
[1:15:17] in church age he's here tonight whether
[1:15:20] we want to recognize now but let's
[1:15:22] recognize it amen hallelujah and they
[1:15:26] rejoice and say you're taking your great
[1:15:28] power and now you're gonna rain on the
[1:15:31] earth verse eighteen other nations feel
[1:15:36] about this the nations were angry angry
[1:15:40] remember they're so angry they still
[1:15:43] won't repent member we looked at under
[1:15:44] the sixth seal couple months ago they're
[1:15:46] so angry they still blaspheme or in
[1:15:49] church you can see on these people that
[1:15:51] they just want more death more abortion
[1:15:54] right they want more Jews to die they
[1:15:57] want world domination you can see that
[1:16:00] spirit growing up on them already more
[1:16:03] wickedness more Eve all they want is
[1:16:05] more and more and more and that's how
[1:16:06] they're gonna be for the rest of the
[1:16:09] time until judgment
[1:16:13] were angry and thy wrath has come and
[1:16:16] the time of the Dead that they should be
[1:16:18] judged now see this is skipping already
[1:16:20] ahead to the Millennium I've start to
[1:16:21] the great white throne judgment after
[1:16:22] the Millennium so see that time is close
[1:16:25] when this happens there's only a
[1:16:27] thousand more years
[1:16:28] that's only one day with the Lord that's
[1:16:30] not very long church I imagine that
[1:16:32] thousand years is gonna go like this
[1:16:34] don't you think there's no temptations
[1:16:38] there's no struggles you never run out
[1:16:40] of energies just from one thing you had
[1:16:42] whatever God's having you build and box
[1:16:44] it will build houses in the habit then
[1:16:46] light right like the like the seventh
[1:16:48] feast of it the the Feast of Tabernacles
[1:16:50] right it'll be like that
[1:16:52] alright I'll finally get to build
[1:16:53] something in my life you know that's
[1:16:55] some physical looking bored of that but
[1:16:58] it'll just go so fast and then the Bible
[1:17:03] said it's closed now it's even closer
[1:17:05] than it was because now there's just a
[1:17:07] one day before the great white throne
[1:17:09] judgment see that they should be judged
[1:17:12] as finished eighteen and that I should
[1:17:14] has give reward unto thy servants the
[1:17:16] prophets and to the Saints
[1:17:19] oh praise the Lord you know so often we
[1:17:21] hear about brother branham's or war
[1:17:22] which he has a great portion of heaven
[1:17:24] and the church said of course he left
[1:17:26] his family he left everything hid great
[1:17:29] portion of heaven but don't forget
[1:17:30] you've got a reward to the Bible said
[1:17:33] the prophets Gary words and so do the
[1:17:35] Saints the thing that is make sure
[1:17:38] you're sane and not a hate right make
[1:17:41] sure you're a real Saint
[1:17:42] a real separated one and gotta have a
[1:17:44] reward for you well I like that that's
[1:17:47] encouraging to me more than profits get
[1:17:50] rewards Saints get rewards and then that
[1:17:54] fear thy name how many fear the name of
[1:17:56] the Lord you respect that Nate you're
[1:17:58] careful how you say that name of Jesus
[1:18:00] I'll see those that fear his name to
[1:18:06] small and great and should as destroy
[1:18:08] them we should restore the earth I was
[1:18:10] reading today the church age book member
[1:18:11] have said that at the white throne
[1:18:13] judgment brother Branham said Berta and
[1:18:14] Nicodemus will be granted eternal life
[1:18:17] even though they never converted over
[1:18:19] into Christianity he said because they
[1:18:21] stood for God's people in a time of
[1:18:24] trouble perhaps they'll be given eternal
[1:18:26] life
[1:18:27] give many of fear God so much they told
[1:18:30] those Jews hey hey don't persecute those
[1:18:32] book of Acts children don't persecute
[1:18:34] them because you might find yourself
[1:18:35] fighting against God that's how much
[1:18:37] fear of God he had he realized this and
[1:18:40] I could be wrong I've been a dedicated
[1:18:42] Jewish teacher I'm a doctorate in
[1:18:45] divinity but I can be wrong
[1:18:46] see cuz he saw power in their movement
[1:18:49] and he didn't see it in his and the
[1:18:51] church said see he feared God he said
[1:18:53] don't don't hurt them you might be found
[1:18:56] fighting against God and the Bible says
[1:18:58] here at that white throne judgment that
[1:19:00] God will have mercy upon those that fear
[1:19:03] the name of God see when you see
[1:19:05] somebody that's fighting or wants to
[1:19:07] fight somebody condemn people judge
[1:19:09] people curse people there's something
[1:19:11] wrong with that they've got the wrong
[1:19:13] spirit see it's those that fear the Lord
[1:19:17] that's a great attribute to have because
[1:19:19] that's the beginning of wisdom
[1:19:21] and see even the beginning of wisdom is
[1:19:23] enough to get you turn 'life hey man
[1:19:25] yeah that's right the fear of the Lord
[1:19:28] is the beginning of wisdom
[1:19:33] see all that fear thy name to the Saints
[1:19:36] of them that fear thy name small and
[1:19:37] great matter how small they are no
[1:19:40] matter how great they are
[1:19:42] see I appreciate you know there's been
[1:19:44] some media my mind's all on this
[1:19:46] abortion there's been some celebrities
[1:19:48] that have kind of sit up for babies on
[1:19:50] more babies lately and church I wonder
[1:19:52] if God will have mercy on some of them
[1:19:55] because it's so unpopular the small and
[1:19:58] the gray anyone that fears the Lord God
[1:20:01] may have mercy on them and God bless
[1:20:04] them for that see smelling great so no
[1:20:08] matter where you are God will have mercy
[1:20:10] on you because remember it's God who
[1:20:12] makes you poor it's God who makes you
[1:20:14] middle class or it's God who makes you
[1:20:16] rich and the church said that was in
[1:20:18] proverbs ecclesiastes we preached out
[1:20:20] recently it's God who does that verse 19
[1:20:27] I'm sorry let's pray
[1:20:28] 18 and should us destroy them which
[1:20:30] destroy the earth so anyone that
[1:20:33] destroys the earth God will destroy them
[1:20:35] so you think of these million dollar
[1:20:37] people that put all these pollutants in
[1:20:38] the world you know they destroy the
[1:20:40] earth they kill the animals but BAM said
[1:20:42] those hunters that shot animals for not
[1:20:44] for sport he said they're murderers
[1:20:46] they're destroying the earth you know
[1:20:48] they're murder they got the wrong spear
[1:20:50] they're not doing it for sport they're
[1:20:52] doing it for murder
[1:20:53] so those who destroyed the earth will be
[1:20:56] judged by God verse 19 and the temple of
[1:21:01] God was opened in heaven now this is
[1:21:05] just a striking mysterious verse here
[1:21:07] and there was seen in his temple the Ark
[1:21:11] of his Testament and there were
[1:21:14] lightnings and voices and thunderings an
[1:21:16] earthquake and great hail we've seen
[1:21:18] that all over right we've seen all we've
[1:21:19] seen lightnings and voices Thunder now
[1:21:21] this is striking I wonder if they're
[1:21:22] gonna see heaven open from the earth
[1:21:24] I wonder or is this just refer to those
[1:21:27] in heaven they can see maybe the
[1:21:29] intercessory booth program talks about
[1:21:31] that and intercessory booth in heaven I
[1:21:33] don't know but Heaven's going to be open
[1:21:36] and they're gonna see the Ark of the
[1:21:38] Testament right that's what the Bible
[1:21:40] said the Ark of his Testament and
[1:21:44] there's lightnings voices thunderings
[1:21:46] earthquake and hail now church notice
[1:21:49] Jesus is off the mercy seat right so
[1:21:52] what is it judgment seat judgment
[1:21:55] Jesus has a vesture that's dipped in
[1:21:58] blood right that's the blood that's
[1:22:00] blood that we have right now thank God
[1:22:02] for the blood that we have right now but
[1:22:04] during this time when the seventh
[1:22:06] trumpet blows Haman has opened up
[1:22:08] there's just an arc of the Covenant and
[1:22:10] there's no blood mercy mercy on them so
[1:22:13] there's no blow on the mercy seat
[1:22:14] it's just judgment and that goes along
[1:22:17] with everything that this chapter has
[1:22:19] taught so far all right now let me start
[1:22:23] chapter 12 I'm not going to get all the
[1:22:24] way through it well let me start I'm
[1:22:26] gonna set my timer here
[1:22:34] we're trying to catch up on my sleep
[1:22:36] this week Victoria was sick on Monday
[1:22:39] night so I got in my sleep got
[1:22:41] interrupted like four or five times you
[1:22:42] know so I'm still trying to catch up on
[1:22:44] my sleep but I want to wear myself out I
[1:22:45] don't want to get sick so verse 1 of
[1:22:48] chapter 12 revelation 12:1 and there
[1:22:54] appeared a great wonder in heaven a
[1:22:55] woman clothed with the Sun and the moon
[1:22:58] under her feet and upon her head a crown
[1:23:00] of twelve stars and she being with child
[1:23:04] cried travailing in birth and pained to
[1:23:07] be delivered how many know who this
[1:23:09] woman is you say it out loud
[1:23:11] Israel this is Israel absolutely now let
[1:23:15] me go through this like I said I'll try
[1:23:16] to go as fast as I can now program tells
[1:23:21] it plainly here this is after the seals
[1:23:22] so many of the mysteries we're now
[1:23:25] beginning to open and be revealed and
[1:23:27] given thus saith the Lord it's not let's
[1:23:28] say the Lord but it does fit all the
[1:23:30] teaching Revelation chapter 12 I have
[1:23:33] said this plainly does not pertain to
[1:23:35] the bride Revelation chapter 12 I
[1:23:38] haven't looked it up but I know it it's
[1:23:39] the woman standing in the Sun with the
[1:23:41] moon under her feet the moon represented
[1:23:44] the law now this is a beautiful teaching
[1:23:46] here the woman representing Israel the
[1:23:48] church the 12 stars in her forehead was
[1:23:51] those 12 apostles the 12 church ages and
[1:23:54] so forth which just passed see and the
[1:23:58] Sun was at her head I think he means 12
[1:23:59] tribes of Israel I think and the Sun was
[1:24:04] at her head which you see the moon as a
[1:24:05] shadow of the Sun which the law was a
[1:24:07] shadow of good things to come and that
[1:24:09] woman is Israel not the bride
[1:24:13] praise God now get your Bibles to go to
[1:24:16] just Hebrews 10:1 just look look at the
[1:24:18] beauty of this now this had to take a
[1:24:19] prophet I never would have thought of
[1:24:21] this scripture program said the moon
[1:24:25] represents the law how does the moon
[1:24:28] represent the law I never would have
[1:24:31] thought this in fact I was so happy and
[1:24:33] related I had a little stimulation of
[1:24:35] Revelation a couple years ago when I
[1:24:36] read this I like Oh glory I never once
[1:24:39] saw that revelation or Hebrews 10 one
[1:24:43] for the law having a shadow of good
[1:24:46] things to come
[1:24:48] and not the very image of things can
[1:24:50] never with those sacrifices which they
[1:24:52] offered year by year continually make
[1:24:55] the comers they aren't too perfect look
[1:24:56] what brother Branham said look the moon
[1:24:59] this isn't 54 the Sun at her head the
[1:25:02] moon and her feet the Sun was
[1:25:03] dispensation of grace to see she's about
[1:25:05] ready to go into grace and the moon was
[1:25:08] the dispensation of the law the woman
[1:25:10] was the Orthodox Church and she was
[1:25:12] standing over the law the law was
[1:25:14] passing away because the law was a
[1:25:16] shadow of the good things to come is
[1:25:20] that right the moon is only a shadow of
[1:25:23] the Sun reflecting of the moon is that
[1:25:24] right making the moon and the law was
[1:25:27] under her feet she had done lived
[1:25:28] through that day and noticed how she was
[1:25:30] dressed here now oh my in that beautiful
[1:25:33] church the moon represents the law that
[1:25:37] was under feet because the moon
[1:25:39] constantly has a shadow on it praise the
[1:25:43] Lord
[1:25:43] who would I never would have thought of
[1:25:45] that but the moon cut I mean there's
[1:25:47] only a couple days right of the month
[1:25:48] there's I think there's 28 days in the
[1:25:49] lunar month there's a 30 30 days in
[1:25:51] lunar month there's only like one or two
[1:25:53] days where it's just full moon all the
[1:25:56] other days it's got a little shadow on
[1:25:58] it so the moon represents the law
[1:26:01] because the moon constantly has a shadow
[1:26:03] and the law was a shadow of good things
[1:26:06] to come lor amen is that right he says
[1:26:11] that is right
[1:26:12] amen that's one way we know that it's
[1:26:16] Israel because they're still under the
[1:26:19] law now let's look
[1:26:23] the timing of this program tells us the
[1:26:25] timing of this the timing of this is
[1:26:28] just before the birth of Jesus Christ
[1:26:30] so verses 1 & 2 and back back to
[1:26:33] Revelation 12 I'm sorry revelation 12:1
[1:26:37] and 2 the timing of this is right before
[1:26:39] the birth of Jesus Christ so a woman is
[1:26:45] Cobra the Sun that's Israel the Orthodox
[1:26:47] Jew clothed with the Sun so she's about
[1:26:50] ready to come into the Sun which is the
[1:26:52] righteousness of Christ the New
[1:26:54] Testament the moon under her feet and
[1:26:56] upon her head a crown of twelve stars
[1:26:59] the twelve stars represent the twelve
[1:27:02] tribes of Israel and she being with
[1:27:05] child cried travailing in birth and
[1:27:08] pained to be delivered so that church
[1:27:13] has to represent when Jesus was going to
[1:27:17] be born to the Israel of Israel right
[1:27:20] through Mary she's pain right she's
[1:27:23] grabbing birth pains the the church the
[1:27:26] Jewish church is about to bring forth
[1:27:27] the Messiah amen my it's just so
[1:27:32] beautiful praise the Lord that church
[1:27:35] and I read this when I first came in in
[1:27:38] the nomination I thought this was the
[1:27:41] bride or something I mean who knows I
[1:27:43] might have thought this was the Muslim
[1:27:44] who knows right position me I had 12
[1:27:46] sons that were princes who knows but see
[1:27:50] with the prophet of God who gave us all
[1:27:52] the other symbols of revelations
[1:27:54] chapters one two three four five six you
[1:27:57] know all these other chapters that gives
[1:27:58] all the symbols now we can put these
[1:28:00] symbols together and now we know exactly
[1:28:02] who it is amen
[1:28:04] now there's just no question about it so
[1:28:08] verses 1 and 2 is right before Jesus
[1:28:10] Christ is born verses 3 and 4 is again
[1:28:13] right before the birth of Christ look
[1:28:15] what it says verse 3 and there appeared
[1:28:17] another wonder in heaven and behold a
[1:28:18] great red dragon having seven heads and
[1:28:21] ten horns and seven Crown's upon his
[1:28:24] head number seven Crown's was that
[1:28:26] represent it represents those seven
[1:28:27] hills upon which she sitteth right 7 10
[1:28:34] horns
[1:28:35] those 10 future for the BAM calls them
[1:28:38] not tyrants dictators there it is
[1:28:43] buh-bam calls those 10 future dictators
[1:28:45] that are going to give their power to
[1:28:47] the beast for a short little season but
[1:28:49] then they're gonna start hating around
[1:28:50] for that and then destroy of course
[1:28:52] Russia is gonna destroy the Vatican and
[1:28:53] for that that's from revelation 17 so
[1:28:57] look at Satan he's pictured as a dragon
[1:29:00] verse four and his tail drew the third
[1:29:03] part of the stars of heaven and did cast
[1:29:07] into the earth
[1:29:09] alright I think I got my and I mixed up
[1:29:12] here oh yeah I guess well this is what I
[1:29:20] alright let me keep going and they cast
[1:29:23] them to the earth verse four and the
[1:29:24] dragon stood before the woman which was
[1:29:25] ready to be delivered oh yeah for to
[1:29:27] devour her child as soon as was born so
[1:29:30] look at that Satan use the third of the
[1:29:32] four demons to get ready to anoint Herod
[1:29:36] to kill all those babies remember when
[1:29:38] Jesus born some wonder what's killing
[1:29:41] those babies today demon powers human
[1:29:45] powers so a third of those demons are
[1:29:52] set are brought to the earth the time of
[1:29:54] Herod to stir them up in order to kill
[1:29:56] all those babies no that's powerful my
[1:30:02] goodness I knew that but it's kind of
[1:30:04] fresh to me tonight that was fulfilled
[1:30:06] to Matthew two 16 and 18 I'm gonna read
[1:30:08] that real quick bath rusik scene and 18
[1:30:16] cuz that fulfilled another prophecy
[1:30:18] I believe Jeremiah Jeremiah prophesied
[1:30:20] of that then Herod when he saw that he
[1:30:25] was mocked of the wise men was exceeding
[1:30:27] wroth and sent forth and slew all the
[1:30:29] children that were in Bethlehem and in
[1:30:31] all the coasts thereof from two years
[1:30:33] old and under according to the time
[1:30:35] which he had diligently inquired of the
[1:30:38] wise men imagine how many that was men
[1:30:42] was fulfilled that which was spoken by
[1:30:43] Jeremy the Prophet saying in Ramah was
[1:30:46] there a voice heard lamentation and
[1:30:48] weeping in great
[1:30:49] mourning Rachel weeping for her children
[1:30:50] and would not be comforted because they
[1:30:53] are not in that sad they were weeping
[1:30:55] for him then and today the women rejoice
[1:30:57] over abortion they rejoice over death
[1:30:59] but there that they still had the
[1:31:01] natural affection right we're living in
[1:31:03] the age where there's no more natural
[1:31:05] affection among sinners so there it was
[1:31:10] fulfilled all of them two years and
[1:31:12] upward my what did that demon powers did
[1:31:16] that okay let's just finish up here got
[1:31:23] a couple more minutes let's just do
[1:31:24] verse five and six then we'll be done
[1:31:25] now verse five and six boy that's good I
[1:31:31] need to use it you know you know why
[1:31:32] that struck me so good because I've had
[1:31:33] people tell me lately o demons don't
[1:31:35] fill people and cause them to do things
[1:31:37] well here approves are right there
[1:31:38] demons were drawn down by Satan's tail
[1:31:41] and anointed Herod and all these men his
[1:31:45] soldiers to kill all these babies it was
[1:31:48] demons that anointed them I tried to
[1:31:50] tell them and look at Matthew 12 Jesus
[1:31:52] said the strong man gets bound up by
[1:31:54] demon powers when one gets cast out if
[1:31:57] they don't get the Holy Ghost in there
[1:31:58] it brings back seven more so that's
[1:32:01] eight demons right and but they just
[1:32:04] can't see that but this will give us
[1:32:05] more viable proof for that good I've
[1:32:06] never used that before that'd be a good
[1:32:08] one to use alright five and six let's
[1:32:12] say to our feet and we'll finish with
[1:32:13] this five and six and she brought forth
[1:32:19] a man child so now we see this is
[1:32:21] actually at the time the birth of Christ
[1:32:24] who was to rule all nations with the rod
[1:32:27] of iron which he hasn't done yet that
[1:32:29] will be in the Millennium because the
[1:32:33] Bible says you two if you if you're an
[1:32:35] overcomer he'll give you a rod of iron
[1:32:36] you know the Bible said that that's one
[1:32:39] of the rewards for the overcomers so
[1:32:41] Christ has the rod of iron we must have
[1:32:43] minor rods of iron and her child
[1:32:53] caught up unto God and to his throne so
[1:32:54] look at verse five you have thirty three
[1:32:57] and a half year 32 33 years of Jesus
[1:32:59] life in Britain verse five you have the
[1:33:01] time he's born to the time he's caught
[1:33:03] up to heaven see that see how God can
[1:33:07] hide all these things in the scripture
[1:33:08] there he can hide 33 years the whole
[1:33:10] life of Christ in one little verse not
[1:33:15] striking now let's go to verse 6 and I'd
[1:33:24] like to find that verse real quick about
[1:33:26] the round of iron so you can see that
[1:33:29] verse 6 and the woman fled in the
[1:33:31] wilderness where she was where she hath
[1:33:34] a place prepared of God that they should
[1:33:36] feed her there a thousand two hundred
[1:33:38] and threescore days now that's again
[1:33:42] three and a half years so God after
[1:33:47] Jesus is ascended it's like God allows
[1:33:50] Israel to go out in this spiritual
[1:33:52] wilderness
[1:33:52] but they don't get fed until the two
[1:33:54] prophets come and the church said that's
[1:33:58] when they really get fed right now
[1:34:00] they're not getting really fed because
[1:34:01] they're not hearing the real preaching
[1:34:03] of God's Word but they're gonna hear the
[1:34:04] real preaching when Moses and Elijah
[1:34:05] start preaching so the man said they're
[1:34:07] gonna preach the same message that we
[1:34:08] received hey man so what are we feeding
[1:34:11] on organ fed by God tonight amen every
[1:34:15] time we gather we're getting fed by
[1:34:17] God's heavenly the table I'll say like
[1:34:19] that Oh glory now give me a minute let's
[1:34:24] go to Revelation 3 I believe it's
[1:34:25] Revelation 3 or giving a rod of iron now
[1:34:30] if I'm wrong I'm gonna be really
[1:34:31] disappointed because I thought I read
[1:34:32] that recently I don't think I'm wrong I
[1:34:35] thought I was right well maybe I am okay
[1:34:42] revelation 2 27 I thought there was a
[1:34:45] scripture that said we would have a rod
[1:34:46] of iron maybe not I could be wrong
[1:34:49] Church I could be wrong about what could
[1:34:50] be one thing I made a mistake on if I
[1:34:53] did forgive me
[1:34:54] 227 okay no no verse 26
[1:34:59] yeah probation 226 and he's at
[1:35:01] overcometh and keepeth my works unto the
[1:35:03] end to him will I give power over the
[1:35:04] nation's and he shall rule them with
[1:35:06] the rod of ayran okay I think is right
[1:35:09] as the vessels of a Potter shall they be
[1:35:12] broken to shivers even as I received my
[1:35:16] father Wow yeah that is that is if you
[1:35:20] can faithfully rule and overcome today
[1:35:23] what age was that in was that Sardis
[1:35:25] I was tired tear oh wow the darkest of
[1:35:29] all the ages where they hardly had
[1:35:32] Bibles right they hardly had any truth
[1:35:34] it was almost completely dead the
[1:35:36] Reformation had even shine forth yet and
[1:35:41] Jesus says if you overcome you'll rule
[1:35:44] over nations and rule them with the rod
[1:35:46] of iron as the vessels of Potter's
[1:35:51] should be broken to shivers think about
[1:35:53] that man God's going to give us power
[1:35:56] over nations to break nations just by
[1:35:59] our Christian character if we can
[1:36:02] overcome right now praise God if it's a
[1:36:05] big hit but with God were more than able
[1:36:07] to do it praise God he that started
[1:36:10] working us he'll be faithful to finish
[1:36:12] that work in us and we can just leave
[1:36:14] here tonight lord help me to rule over
[1:36:16] my sinful nature help me to rule over

[1:46:41] quick I was just thinking about this how
[1:46:45] many want to be perfect in Christ the
[1:46:48] Bible said he'd have perfected forever
[1:46:53] then that are sanctified Hebrews 10:24
[1:46:57] and a new a new thought came to me today
[1:47:00] I've seen it for by one offering he has
[1:47:02] perfected forever then that are
[1:47:04] sanctified as sanctified means you're
[1:47:07] being set aside see in order for us for
[1:47:11] God to perfect us and be complete we've
[1:47:13] got to be continually sanctified and
[1:47:15] that's happening right now tonight

[1:47:50] God I'm not what I used to be praise God
[1:47:54] I'm not what I used to be I can see
[1:47:57] Christ taking more preeminence in my
[1:47:59] life not perfect yet but I am more
[1:48:03] sanctified that's the way out I love
[1:48:07] that scripture just struck me today I
[1:48:09] think I saw an ESV translation of it it
[1:48:12] says something like that he has
[1:48:13] perfected forever then that are being
[1:48:15] washed constantly every service is so
[1:48:19] important to be washed that's how he
