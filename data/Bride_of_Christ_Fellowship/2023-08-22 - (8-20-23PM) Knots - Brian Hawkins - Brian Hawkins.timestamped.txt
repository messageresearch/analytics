[2:16] I still wasn't sure which way to go this
[2:18] evening but uh
[2:20] just kind of picked one and let's go
[2:25] bear with me on that Isaiah 55 starting
[2:28] in the fifth or excuse me of the first
[2:29] verse
[2:31] so is hope
[2:32] everyone that thirsteth
[2:35] Come Ye to the waters and he that hath
[2:38] no money Come Ye by and eat yea come buy
[2:43] wine and milk without money and without
[2:45] price amen
[2:48] wherefore do you spend money for that
[2:50] which is not bread and your labor for
[2:53] that which satisfieth not
[2:55] hearken diligently unto me an ee that
[2:59] which is good and let your soul Delight
[3:02] itself in fatness
[3:05] incline your ear and come unto me hear
[3:09] and your soul shall live
[3:11] and I will make an Everlasting Covenant
[3:14] with you even the sure mercies of David
[3:19] amen behold I have given him for a
[3:21] witness to the people
[3:23] a leader and a commander to the people
[3:29] behold Thou shalt call a nation that
[3:33] thou knew us not and Nations that do not
[3:36] thee shall run run unto thee because of
[3:39] the Lord thy God and for the Holy One of
[3:42] Israel for he hath glorified thee
[3:45] seek ye the Lord while he may be found
[3:49] call ye upon him while he is near Amen
[3:52] Let The Wicked forsake his way and the
[3:54] unrighteous man his thoughts and let him
[3:56] return unto the Lord and He will have
[3:58] mercy upon him and to our God for he
[4:02] will abundantly pardon Hallelujah not
[4:06] just a little bit not just one or two
[4:08] but abundantly pardon everybody knows
[4:11] what abundantly means right it's a whole
[4:13] lot
[4:16] so he will abundantly pardon
[4:21] for my thoughts are not your thoughts
[4:23] neither are your ways my ways saith the
[4:26] Lord
[4:27] for as the heavens are higher than the
[4:29] earth so are my ways higher than your
[4:31] ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
[4:35] for as the rain cometh down and the snow
[4:38] from heaven and returneth not thither
[4:41] but watereth the Earth and maketh that
[4:44] bring forth and Bud that it may give
[4:46] seed to the sower and bread to the eater
[4:50] so shall my word be that goeth forth out
[4:53] of my mouth it shall not return unto me
[4:57] void
[4:59] but it shall accomplish that which I
[5:03] please
[5:04] and it shall prosper in the thing where
[5:06] whereto I sent it see his word has a
[5:10] purpose and even he said that that it
[5:13] will not return unto me void but it
[5:15] shall accomplish what I please
[5:18] yes
[5:22] for ye shall go out with joy and be led
[5:25] forth with peace the mountains and the
[5:28] hills shall Break Forth before you into
[5:30] singing
[5:32] and all the trees of the field shall
[5:34] clap their hands
[5:36] instead of the thorn shall come up the
[5:39] fir tree and instead of the Briar shall
[5:41] come up the Myrtle tree and it shall be
[5:43] to the Lord for a name for an
[5:46] everlasting sign that shall not be cut
[5:49] off let's look to the Lord in prayer
[5:52] Heavenly Father we just thank you for
[5:54] another time that we have today gathered
[5:57] around with uh in fellowship with one
[5:59] another to to hear your word father
[6:02] there's there's nothing that I have but
[6:05] but what you've laid on my heart oh God
[6:07] I just pray that you would be in the
[6:08] service and leave me and guide me I just
[6:10] give myself over unto you to use me as
[6:12] you see fit father we just pray that we
[6:14] could be a blessing to the people this
[6:16] evening we ask in your precious name our
[6:18] Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
[6:26] just gotta have a
[6:28] it's not the greatest of titles but uh
[6:31] good to see you brother Bank
[6:34] just a thought is uh because of all the
[6:38] knots
[6:42] because of all the knots k-n-o-t-s
[6:48] now as as we read through there it shows
[6:50] that the Lord will take care of his
[6:51] people we all know that we know that the
[6:54] Lord is going to take care of his own he
[6:55] won't he won't forsake his people he
[6:58] won't see his people begging bread right
[6:59] but he's going to provide for his
[7:02] children
[7:03] man you know because he's a good father
[7:05] so a good father will will do just that
[7:07] he will provide for his children so and
[7:10] he also said let the wicked first let
[7:12] the wicked and the unrighteous forsake
[7:14] forsake their way and return unto the
[7:17] Lord uh for the Lord will show Mercy
[7:19] through an abundant pardon right
[7:24] so when when he has ordained us for work
[7:27] he didn't ask uh he didn't ask us to
[7:30] bring our skills he didn't bring us ask
[7:32] us to bring our knowledge but he just
[7:34] said to go right so for his ways are
[7:37] higher than our ways
[7:39] so when he speaks uh his worship return
[7:42] void but it shall accomplish what he set
[7:45] out uh what he what he set out for it to
[7:47] be right so for whatever he pleases and
[7:50] it will prosper
[7:52] um and then we can go out with joy and
[7:54] be led with peace trusting and knowing
[7:57] that that we are in his hands right
[8:01] where it says there uh for you uh for ye
[8:04] shall go out with joy and be led forth
[8:07] with peace the mountains in the Hills
[8:10] shall Break Forth before you into
[8:11] singing and all the trees of the fields
[8:14] or clap their hands I can't help but
[8:15] think of the mountains of of being our
[8:17] trials and being a hard situations in
[8:20] our ways you know for when Jesus said
[8:22] you speak unto this mountain and shall
[8:24] be moved uh it's probably not a literal
[8:27] Mountain that you're gonna raise up
[8:29] Mount Everest but there's a problem
[8:30] there's a great mountain of a situation
[8:33] in your way you could speak to this
[8:34] mountain and say it be be plucked up and
[8:37] be moved from here out of my way and
[8:40] over here right amen so when we when we
[8:43] when we're LED forth uh with with the
[8:45] peace we have the joy the mountains
[8:47] shall be shall break out in song and
[8:49] it's singing and the trees shall be
[8:51] clapping their hands right but but for
[8:53] one thing for sure they know rock going
[8:54] to take my place ain't no Rock don't cry
[8:56] at my place ain't no tree gonna take my
[8:58] place of clapping hands ain't no birds
[9:00] gonna take my place a second right
[9:01] because we're going to sing Joys unto
[9:03] the Lord amen for we know where he's
[9:05] brought us through like we were talking
[9:06] this morning that I will not forget his
[9:08] his testimonies but I will not forget
[9:10] the testimony that he has given me amen
[9:12] so I I I've had an experience with the
[9:14] Lord and I I dare not forget those kind
[9:16] of things so I will sing I Will shout I
[9:19] will praise I will testify of the
[9:21] goodness of what he's done because he
[9:23] set forth a path in my life he set for
[9:25] the path in your life
[9:29] right so we're all led to do something
[9:31] right and he is he's given each and
[9:34] every one of us a purpose
[9:36] not just to sit in and just sit in our
[9:37] chairs or sitting in the Pew and just
[9:39] just be a pure warmer that's or uh uh
[9:42] I better stay off of that subject that's
[9:45] that's up for another time I was going
[9:46] to go somewhere else but I'm going to
[9:48] try to stay focused but we're not Bench
[9:50] Warmers we're not pure warmers we're
[9:52] here to participate we're here to
[9:54] partake right and that's what communion
[9:56] is community yeah it's a special service
[9:59] maybe you do it once a month once a
[10:01] quarter once a year I don't know what
[10:02] y'all do for communion service but every
[10:04] service should be a communion service
[10:06] because we should be speaking communing
[10:08] with the lord it's a back and forth
[10:10] conversation right it's a relationship
[10:12] it's not a it's not a monologue just one
[10:15] person talking and have a conversation
[10:17] it should be a dialogue right two people
[10:19] having a conversation somebody speaking
[10:22] and then somebody returning saying yes I
[10:24] heard what you said and this is how I
[10:26] feel about it there's a conversation
[10:28] there's a relationship happening amen so
[10:33] um but uh
[10:36] Caleb and I were out we were doing some
[10:38] firewood and bear with me Caleb I'm not
[10:41] trying to embarrass him at all but he
[10:42] kind of inspired this this message
[10:45] as we were doing some firewood and uh it
[10:48] was up on this bank and we had to roll
[10:50] all the stuff I pulled the trailer up
[10:52] beside the ditch and we're rolling it
[10:53] down down the hill and then loading it
[10:56] on there's a trailer and it was it
[10:57] wasn't little stuff it was big stuff
[10:59] that we were rolling uh so for a young
[11:02] man uh it was kind of hard to to roll
[11:05] the piece that he was rolling and uh it
[11:07] took both of us but uh I said come on
[11:10] get that thing up on there he says I
[11:11] can't I said he said I can't because of
[11:14] all the nuts and he was right there were
[11:16] a lot of knots on it and you know if you
[11:18] ever try to roll a log that has a lot of
[11:20] knots on it it doesn't roll very well
[11:22] you know it's not symmetrical to where
[11:24] it would just turn but it's uh I guess
[11:28] you could say it's an abstract
[11:31] but it was oblong
[11:33] hard to turn you know what that would
[11:36] make a good sermon because of all the
[11:38] knots you know uh everybody knows what a
[11:41] knot is
[11:42] huh if you don't know what a knot is
[11:44] I'll give you some some explanations of
[11:46] what a knot is and this is knot
[11:51] um a fastening made by tying together
[11:54] lengths of materials such as rope and a
[11:56] prescribed way so everybody ties
[11:58] shoelaces I presume or you tie your
[12:01] gifts at a bow you're tying some kind of
[12:04] a knot right so it's a fascinating by
[12:06] tying something together
[12:08] a unifying Bond especially a marriage
[12:12] bond
[12:13] so you ever hear the term you know
[12:17] do a couple here just tied the knot
[12:19] right so it's an expression of marriage
[12:22] so there's there's a unifying Bond
[12:24] okay so that's another type of another
[12:27] type of nut
[12:29] uh a tight cluster of of persons or
[12:32] things I haven't really used this one
[12:34] too much you know you see a group of
[12:35] people out there there's a knot of
[12:37] people I've never used that term before
[12:40] so that that's something that was
[12:42] something new for me uh I guess you
[12:44] could call them clicks or we call them
[12:46] clicks now so uh
[12:49] a feeling of tightness you get a little
[12:52] bit stressed you know you ever feel the
[12:54] the knots in your shoulders or in your
[12:56] back or something like that so that's
[12:58] another type of a knot usually comes
[13:00] from stress right right
[13:02] and here's here's another one it's a a
[13:05] complex problem
[13:09] a complex problem
[13:12] and we see that there are uh there's an
[13:15] array of different uh
[13:19] of what knots can be you know some of us
[13:22] might have uh known some of those some
[13:25] of us might not have known what some of
[13:27] those are but regardless that's a lot of
[13:29] excuses right so it just gives you a
[13:32] whole thing of a lot of excuses that you
[13:34] can make you know there's a lot of a lot
[13:36] of fallbacks but yet there's a lot of
[13:38] Stepping Stones
[13:40] Okay so
[13:41] nuts
[13:43] uh is it okay if I just talk to you this
[13:45] evening yeah
[13:46] I'll try not to get too excited
[13:53] but not sir not sort of type of anxiety
[13:56] right we get we get all knotted up and
[13:59] uh like we were talking this morning we
[14:01] all have struggles we all have Strife we
[14:03] all have trials and tribulations we have
[14:06] these things in our lives we can't
[14:07] escape those things that's just life
[14:09] life just happens so we all have those
[14:12] kind of things we have the the
[14:14] difficulties and and all that so
[14:16] sometimes we have so many knots in our
[14:18] lives that that it becomes it turns into
[14:21] severe mind battles
[14:23] you know we get so scrupled up and then
[14:26] we get so bound up
[14:28] from our anxieties
[14:30] that can cause those those mind battles
[14:34] that bring us down and then we then we
[14:36] lose our joy we lose our happiness we
[14:39] lose our fellowship
[14:40] because of these nuts that happen in our
[14:43] lives
[14:44] but you know sometimes we have the
[14:46] setbacks we had the roadblocks you know
[14:48] we had the speed bumps in our lives just
[14:50] things that slow us down for some reason
[14:52] or another
[14:53] and this just causes many people to quit
[14:58] because the way it gets a little bit
[14:59] rough the way it gets a little bit hard
[15:03] and people just want to quit so what
[15:06] happens they want to go back to where it
[15:08] was easy you know just like the children
[15:10] of Israel uh that they started whining
[15:13] and complaining because things started
[15:14] getting a little bit hard you know oh it
[15:16] would have been better for us to be
[15:18] slaves to the Egyptians where would it
[15:21] be easier to be a slave to somebody
[15:23] instead of in Freedom
[15:26] I would much rather have freedom than be
[15:29] a slave to somebody else amen amen
[15:33] I would much rather be I would much
[15:35] rather have that fight to continue to
[15:38] fight for my freedom instead of being a
[15:40] slave to somebody
[15:41] oh yeah I shouldn't be under somebody
[15:43] else's thumb you shouldn't be under
[15:45] somebody else's thumb you shouldn't have
[15:47] the oppression of the devil upon you so
[15:49] where therefore you have the power to
[15:51] release amen
[15:53] so like we were saying this morning well
[15:57] we look for the excuses all these
[16:00] excuses for a way out right so well I'm
[16:02] not good enough I'm not good looking
[16:05] enough you know we can never be good
[16:07] enough Ephesians 2 8 tells us that you
[16:09] know it's uh for Grace by you uh for
[16:12] it's by grace that we are saved and not
[16:14] of ourselves right but it's a gift of
[16:16] God so well I'm not smart enough
[16:19] well if any man lacks wisdom let him ask
[16:22] of God right uh well like I said I'm not
[16:25] cool enough
[16:26] well be clothed with humility yes sir
[16:30] you want to be cool be clothed with
[16:32] humility amen yes
[16:34] well not religious enough
[16:38] sometimes that's good
[16:42] in some respects that's good because we
[16:44] we got to get out of that starchy
[16:46] religious attitude that's stretching
[16:48] religious atmosphere and just be free in
[16:51] the Holy Spirit right
[16:53] sometimes we get just so religious that
[16:55] it just causes us to be more bound than
[16:58] free yeah
[17:01] yeah we get so starchy as it well
[17:04] everything's going to be an order of
[17:05] this that
[17:07] you got to have everything you keep
[17:08] brother you can't play anything out of
[17:10] key you can't play anything upbeat
[17:11] everything's got to be mediocre one two
[17:14] three four nothing faster nothing slower
[17:17] we can't do anything like that see how
[17:19] see how boring and kind of starchy that
[17:21] would be and I don't think the Lord
[17:22] would like something like that you know
[17:23] amen like we were saying this morning
[17:25] let everything that has breath praise
[17:27] the Lord praise him on the tambourine
[17:30] praise him on the the the the symbols
[17:32] the loud symbols the high sounding
[17:33] symbols whatever it is the drums your
[17:35] feet your hands your mouth whatever it
[17:37] is let everything give let everything
[17:39] give praise to God Amen
[17:44] so I'm not religious enough James 1 27
[17:47] he says
[17:48] we get the wrong idea of what religion
[17:50] is you know people will go around
[17:52] they'll ask well what religion are you
[17:54] I'm a Christian
[17:56] but other people will say well I'm a
[17:59] Catholic I'm a Baptist how about if you
[18:01] just say that you're a Christian right
[18:02] yes yes I just had a talk with her with
[18:05] a brother yesterday and uh just some
[18:07] things that we had talked about some uh
[18:10] you know some different things that that
[18:12] uh that we believe they don't really
[18:14] believe and he's you know he doesn't
[18:17] want to force it on anybody well I'm not
[18:19] going to criticize what you do I said
[18:20] well I'm not going to criticize what you
[18:21] do I mean we have our set of beliefs and
[18:24] that's the way that we're going to that
[18:25] as far as my house you know that's the
[18:28] way that we're going to serve the Lord
[18:30] right so uh your house is going to be
[18:33] something different maybe you you might
[18:35] you might have different uh different
[18:38] strict beliefs or or whatever it might
[18:40] be
[18:42] but before we got off the phone I said
[18:45] um I'll tell you one thing I'll just he
[18:48] didn't know how to label it you know I
[18:50] said well I don't really like labels
[18:51] let's just say that we're a Christian
[18:53] amen so the character should follow
[18:58] the confession yes right so if you
[19:01] profess to be a Christian you ought to
[19:02] live a Christian Life
[19:04] so what is religion James says in James
[19:08] 1 27 it says pure religion and undefiled
[19:11] before God and the father is this to
[19:15] visit the fatherless and widows in their
[19:17] Affliction amen and to keep himself
[19:20] unspotted from the world yes that's what
[19:25] pure religion and undefiled before God
[19:28] is
[19:30] amen
[19:31] how many feel religious
[19:35] if you feel religious maybe you maybe
[19:38] you visited somebody in this situation I
[19:40] don't know but it's helping you know uh
[19:42] through the Scripture it tells us to
[19:44] take care of widows right yes
[19:46] yes it takes it says to take care of the
[19:48] the fatherless right so take care of one
[19:50] another
[19:51] you want to be religious it's it's
[19:53] serving somebody else
[19:57] well I'm not dedicated enough well II
[20:00] Peter 3 and 14 says wherefore if beloved
[20:02] seeing that you look for such things be
[20:04] diligent that you may be found of him in
[20:07] peace without spot and blameless
[20:10] being diligent
[20:12] so if you say that you're not dedicated
[20:14] enough or diligent enough the scripture
[20:16] is telling you be diligent
[20:19] and we and we love his testimonies right
[20:23] this is a precept
[20:26] so this is something that we ought to
[20:28] love
[20:29] well my clothes aren't good enough well
[20:31] we don't look on the outward appearance
[20:33] right but we look on the things on the
[20:36] inner man
[20:37] Hallelujah
[20:39] here's a common one you ever hear the
[20:41] young people say I just don't fit in
[20:43] anywhere
[20:45] that's a pretty common one right do you
[20:48] young people feel like you fit in or do
[20:50] you feel like you're you're out placed
[20:52] at a place wherever you go
[20:54] you don't have to answer that question
[20:55] but you know
[20:57] just answer it in your heart and your
[20:59] mind
[21:01] so a lot a lot of people especially the
[21:03] youth they feel out of place
[21:06] but I just don't fit in anywhere why
[21:08] because people are different well that's
[21:10] the way the world is made up is
[21:12] everybody is different even even twins
[21:15] have differences right right so
[21:20] even if they look alike and they they
[21:22] even act like there's still some kind of
[21:24] a differences everybody is different in
[21:26] one shape form or another that's right
[21:32] I was going to say something but I
[21:33] better leave that one alone I don't want
[21:34] to get in trouble
[21:37] but people there is just so many so many
[21:39] differences out there that were not
[21:41] alike yeah you might have some common
[21:43] ground in some things but everything is
[21:45] not identical
[21:47] yeah so somewhere something isn't going
[21:50] to fit
[21:51] yo and that's that's what makes the the
[21:54] the the variety so wonderful that's what
[21:57] makes America so great because it's more
[21:59] than just it's just more it's more than
[22:01] just one culture it's a whole bunch of
[22:03] people that can live in unity
[22:06] amen which they said was impossible
[22:08] years ago
[22:10] yeah it might look like that now but
[22:11] most people I think are living in peace
[22:14] I think we all get along right because
[22:17] we have common ground of Jesus Christ
[22:19] amen and we all have common decency
[22:21] right
[22:23] we all have uh care for one another
[22:27] even if it was somebody strange where
[22:30] South America wherever it might be
[22:32] we would take them in with open arms
[22:34] right amen why because it's the love of
[22:36] the father that's within us
[22:38] right well if you just don't fit
[22:41] anywhere first Peter 2 9 says but you
[22:43] are our chosen generation a royal
[22:46] priesthood and a holy nation A peculiar
[22:49] people
[22:52] we're purchased right yes so that you
[22:55] should show forth the Praises of him who
[22:57] hath called you out of Darkness Into His
[23:00] Marvelous Light
[23:03] well here's another one you know Psalm
[23:06] sings to this Psalm says to to make a
[23:09] Joyful Noise unto the Lord but
[23:13] some people just don't like to to sing
[23:15] because they said
[23:17] I just can't sing very well well not
[23:20] everybody has to sound like Aretha
[23:22] Franklin or David Phelps or anything
[23:23] like that yo just like the scripture
[23:26] says Sing A Joyful Noise unto the Lord
[23:28] right so
[23:31] you know and who would you rather
[23:32] pattern yourself after
[23:34] I would rather follow after David's
[23:36] advice
[23:37] because David was a man after God's Own
[23:39] Heart right so I want to follow after
[23:41] that pattern I don't want to follow
[23:42] after Samuel's Sons I don't want to
[23:44] follow after Eli's Sons I'd like to
[23:46] follow after David yeah because David is
[23:48] specific it's specific calling him out
[23:51] that he is a man after God's Own Heart
[23:53] so if he's a man after God's Own Heart
[23:55] and he was pleasing unto the father
[23:58] that's what that's a pattern I'd like to
[24:00] follow amen
[24:04] so
[24:05] through some of these things I'm sure
[24:08] you know probably something hit
[24:09] somewhere but uh do you measure up
[24:13] we all fall short right that's where
[24:15] what we were talking about this this
[24:17] morning is that we all fall short of the
[24:18] glory of God right
[24:20] but it's not
[24:22] I think it's second Corinthians 4 7 let
[24:25] it uh
[24:29] I can't remember exactly how I said but
[24:31] something about the Excellency of the
[24:33] power to be of God can you bring that up
[24:36] second Corinthians 4 7 I think is what
[24:38] it is
[24:45] but we have this treasure in Earthen
[24:47] vessels that the Excellency of the power
[24:49] may be of God and not of us see we say
[24:53] it so many times that it just becomes
[24:54] commonplace that oh well I know it's not
[24:57] us but why do we try so hard still why
[25:00] do we get so upset because I'm not good
[25:02] enough
[25:04] I I told brother Jesse this morning
[25:07] because he he uh this afternoon I I
[25:10] heard him say something about the Lord's
[25:11] Prayer and brother Jim was just
[25:13] preaching on that and I just had a
[25:14] thought the other the other day of how
[25:16] overly overly used that scripture is or
[25:19] that prayer is but it's so under
[25:21] believed
[25:23] we say it well I know it's not me I know
[25:25] it's the Lord in me but why are we
[25:27] cutting the Lord short
[25:28] yeah I just preached a message back home
[25:31] hearing my send me
[25:32] yo if the Lord the Lord called Isaiah
[25:35] Isaiah kind of made an excuse and you
[25:37] know I'm a man of unclean lips but the
[25:39] but the angel came with the with that
[25:41] coal of fire and touched his lips to
[25:43] cleanse his lips right right right amen
[25:45] fire is a cleansing power the Holy Ghost
[25:47] of fire is a cleansing power right
[25:50] so do we not have that Holy Ghost within
[25:52] us or not
[25:53] right you know so and then we call
[25:56] ourselves names
[25:59] right we try not to call other people's
[26:02] names because we want to be respectful
[26:04] right well we want to treat them because
[26:06] they're made in the image of God so we
[26:08] don't want to call them we don't want to
[26:09] call them names
[26:11] but what about you
[26:14] yeah I kind of I'm kind of diverting off
[26:16] this message I'm getting into another
[26:17] one
[26:19] so bear with me but but how do we view
[26:22] ourselves do we look so far down on
[26:24] ourselves that we're calling ourselves
[26:25] Dane don't ye not that you are the
[26:27] Temple of the Holy Ghost
[26:29] so how do we speak against the Temple of
[26:32] the Holy Ghost by calling ourselves
[26:34] names
[26:37] why do you always call yourself a genius
[26:39] well I don't want to call myself a bad
[26:41] name so I use something a little bit
[26:43] better even though it is sarcasm you
[26:46] know there's no way to go genius yo just
[26:49] did something uh not real bright
[26:51] the the light bulb just
[26:53] illuminated a little bit it was a dumb
[26:56] idea
[26:57] you know so but we do those things then
[27:00] we call ours we're so hard on ourselves
[27:06] but you know if you don't try something
[27:09] if you don't put forth and effort it's
[27:11] an automatic failure right right that's
[27:13] right amen so if you feel led try it
[27:17] Hallelujah if you have that leading go
[27:19] if you if you hear that voice do
[27:22] something about it
[27:24] hey man
[27:27] even if you think you can't do it you
[27:28] know perseverance is is is is is is
[27:30] exactly that is uh continuing on with
[27:33] something even though it scares you to
[27:35] death
[27:36] I don't like talking in front of people
[27:40] believe it or not I don't like talking
[27:41] in front of people it just makes me
[27:43] nervous
[27:45] but still it's a perseverance
[27:48] you don't know how to do this job it's a
[27:50] it's a solo thing maybe you're a
[27:51] machinist and you've got to work on the
[27:53] machine the first time and you're going
[27:54] to make this part oh man I don't want to
[27:56] mess this up yeah of course you're going
[27:57] to be nervous right but who says you
[28:00] can't do it as soon as you say that I
[28:01] can't do it you failed right there
[28:03] that's right you're pretty much
[28:05] admitting defeat right now
[28:07] because we look too much at ourselves we
[28:10] that we can't do this and we can't do
[28:12] that yo
[28:14] Moses tried to get out of his calling
[28:16] one time
[28:17] you know when the Lord was calling her
[28:19] and says well I'm a man of stammering
[28:21] lips you know I I don't it might not be
[28:24] him who exactly said that one but I'm I
[28:27] can't speak very well I'm not an
[28:28] eloquent speaker so you can't use me he
[28:31] said well that's enough of that excuse I
[28:33] guess we'll use Aaron
[28:36] but one way or another my word is going
[28:39] to go forth right
[28:41] it's not going to come back unto me Boyd
[28:44] because it's going to accomplish the
[28:46] purpose that I set forth amen
[28:49] because this is my pleasure and
[28:51] this is what I want so I'm going to
[28:53] receive what I want right
[28:58] excuse me
[29:00] but look look how look how well that the
[29:03] Lord used Moses right how powerful Moses
[29:06] was that he was he was a pretty much a
[29:09] one-man Army right but we know that it
[29:11] wasn't exactly Moses right but it was by
[29:15] the leading of the Lord because the lord
[29:16] gave him commission to go out and do
[29:18] these things he walked out in the
[29:20] instruction or at the instruction of the
[29:23] Lord and he went with that Rod right it
[29:25] wasn't just a stick in his hand you know
[29:26] if those Egyptians would have taken that
[29:28] stick out of his hand right
[29:30] he'd have been whooped but it wasn't
[29:32] just a stick it was God's judgment Rob
[29:39] see we put too much emphasis on us and
[29:41] not enough emphasis on him right yeah
[29:46] so it was absolutely God see in our
[29:48] weakness he is made strong right amen
[29:51] why because we can't do it right
[29:55] yo look at look at Samson you know
[29:58] Samson was he
[30:00] you know
[30:01] supposed to be this this scrawny guy of
[30:04] course everybody thinks that he was just
[30:05] uh Arnold Schwarzenegger type of guy and
[30:08] uh just muscle bound but but look what
[30:11] he did he had a commission from God look
[30:13] you go do this and I'm going to be with
[30:15] you through every step of the way as
[30:17] long as you keep this
[30:19] that right the Nazarite vowel as long as
[30:21] you keep this
[30:23] you stay in my good graces but he made a
[30:26] mess of things
[30:28] because he didn't live true to God right
[30:30] his desire his heart we know he didn't
[30:33] give his heart over to the Lord he only
[30:34] gave his strength over to over to the
[30:37] Lord right
[30:37] yes sir but brother sister we need to
[30:39] change our vocabulary
[30:42] we need to change our vocabulary from I
[30:45] can't do this
[30:46] unto I can
[30:48] I can do this amen
[30:51] I can
[30:54] I will
[30:56] I do believe right you know that song I
[31:00] can I will I do believe yes amen see we
[31:07] spend so much time telling ourselves
[31:08] that we can't and we put ourselves down
[31:11] and we put ourselves in the failure
[31:16] we don't build a wall up of of uh of
[31:19] success we're building the walls of
[31:21] failure
[31:23] through the words that we speak
[31:26] did not Jesus say that if you speak unto
[31:29] this mountain it should be plucked up
[31:30] right
[31:32] so if you speak unto your situation
[31:34] negativity
[31:37] it's not going to go anywhere it's
[31:39] defeat
[31:41] amen yeah
[31:45] if you want to say can't
[31:48] then you say the devil can't
[31:51] the devil can't do this and the devil
[31:53] can't do this amen
[31:56] that's that's we need to start changing
[31:58] our our vocabulary of the of the the way
[32:01] that we're saying things the way that
[32:03] we're calling out situations
[32:06] amen
[32:08] because we've read the back of the book
[32:09] right so we know where his fate Lies We
[32:12] already know that he's a defeated folk
[32:13] Jesus already took captivity captive he
[32:16] took our he took our captor our our
[32:20] prisoner prisoner right amen he took our
[32:23] captor prisoner
[32:26] amen yes but also the scripture says
[32:28] what is it Philippians 4 13 I could do
[32:31] all things through Christ who
[32:33] strengthens me right so I can't
[32:36] we just have to have that positive
[32:38] attitude about it right yeah but like I
[32:41] said uh he didn't say to bring your
[32:42] skills but he did say to trust him
[32:46] amen
[32:47] now see when when I said if you feel led
[32:50] go sometimes we get into the situation
[32:53] where it feels like we have to force the
[32:55] situation why I felt led to go here I
[32:57] felt led to do this but it just feels
[32:59] like I hit a roadblock well be careful
[33:03] because Balaam had the same type of
[33:05] situation right
[33:08] he had the donkey and he was getting mad
[33:11] at his donkey because his donkey
[33:12] wouldn't go
[33:14] but he didn't know that it was the angel
[33:16] of the Lord and his way
[33:19] because Balaam had the wrong motive he
[33:21] was going about it the wrong way that's
[33:23] right amen amen
[33:25] so sometimes when you push your way
[33:27] through when you're trying to push and
[33:29] you're trying to push you're trying to
[33:30] push be careful because it might be the
[33:33] angel of the Lord in the way of your
[33:34] donkey
[33:36] so it's time to take a step back
[33:39] take inventory see what's going on amen
[33:41] amen
[33:43] sometimes knots are needed right
[33:46] so there's a season to everything
[33:48] there's a there's a season to tie knots
[33:50] and there's a season two untie knots
[33:52] right so when you tie a knot what's the
[33:55] purpose of a knot
[33:58] to fasten something right to hold
[33:59] something down so it's to hold something
[34:02] in place so there's a time to tie the
[34:04] knot
[34:05] if you have if you have cargo we use
[34:07] binding straps so we'll we'll use the
[34:10] binding straps so hold the to hold the
[34:11] load down
[34:14] but if you need it in the package what
[34:15] do you do
[34:17] you untie the knot right so there's a
[34:19] season to everything there's a time for
[34:21] the knots there's a time for the
[34:22] stresses in our lives there's a time to
[34:24] de-stress amen so you ever try to climb
[34:28] a smooth rope
[34:30] anybody nobody's ever tried to climb a
[34:32] smooth rope did you ever do that back in
[34:33] high school brother
[34:35] no
[34:36] it's hard to climb a smooth rope
[34:38] try it one time not real high
[34:42] don't go real high tie it on a limb and
[34:44] see how it is trying to climb up a
[34:46] smooth rope with no knots in it
[34:48] you'll find that if you put knots in the
[34:51] Rope those are Stepping Stones to climb
[34:53] higher all right amen so sometimes the
[34:56] knots are needed we have to go through
[34:57] situations in our lives hey man
[35:00] sometimes those situations are needed so
[35:02] we know that we could overcome the next
[35:04] situation well I overcame that situation
[35:06] now see David slew the Giant Goliath
[35:08] right
[35:09] everybody knows that story yeah yeah but
[35:12] do you read do you realize a little bit
[35:14] later where David's Brothers also salute
[35:17] Giants right right right how is it
[35:20] because they knew that David was able to
[35:23] slay the one giant so if he's able to
[35:25] slay that giant we are more than able
[35:28] to be conquerors amen right
[35:31] right because we saw somebody else do it
[35:33] we saw that it was possible we look at
[35:36] our situation and said this is so
[35:38] impossible to get out of
[35:40] but you look somebody who's had
[35:42] successes
[35:44] and you follow after that pattern yes
[35:47] David showed that it could be done and
[35:49] his brothers just followed suit and
[35:51] figuring hey there's no adversary that
[35:53] could stay in our way especially when it
[35:55] comes against our God Amen
[35:59] thinking not strange these fiery trials
[36:01] that are in our lives right yeah
[36:05] tie the knot
[36:07] then it's loosed
[36:09] it's no longer bound but it's free amen
[36:13] amen Jesus said verily I say unto you
[36:15] whatsoever you shall bind on Earth shall
[36:17] be bound into heaven and whatsoever you
[36:19] shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in
[36:21] heaven
[36:22] right
[36:24] see we underrate
[36:26] our privileges
[36:28] we underrate ourselves
[36:31] we don't recognize the authority that we
[36:34] have in this scripture and that's what
[36:36] puts us down well I can't I can't attain
[36:38] that perfection
[36:40] well I know Christ has he he was perfect
[36:42] but he also made us perfect
[36:46] through his sacrifice right
[36:49] you know he asked a strange question to
[36:51] the disciples are you worthy to drink of
[36:54] the same cup that I drank of
[36:57] you know many of us would say oh no I'm
[36:59] not worthy to drink of that same cup
[37:02] because he's so much higher than we are
[37:05] right yeah and that would be humility
[37:07] but that's going under our privileges
[37:10] you know when I was reading that the one
[37:11] time I was saying wow they answered
[37:14] quite boldly brother
[37:17] they answered quite boldly
[37:19] and so should you
[37:21] and so should you amen live your life
[37:24] that is that's of boldness in your life
[37:27] not putting yourself down but putting it
[37:29] in not not living in Pride understand
[37:31] that I'm I'm trying to distinguish
[37:33] between pride and Authority right we
[37:35] have this Authority in the scripture to
[37:37] say unto these mountains to say unto
[37:39] these situations that we can do
[37:41] something about these situations amen
[37:43] amen what can we do
[37:46] you are you can't go defeat City Hall
[37:49] no but I know one that can right that's
[37:52] right
[37:55] how are we going to defeat Jericho they
[37:58] got this huge wall up there right yo
[38:01] could you imagine what the people were
[38:02] thinking Joshua you are nuts if you
[38:04] think we're gonna go knock that wall
[38:06] down
[38:07] you know it was something that seemed
[38:09] unsurmountable it seemed like something
[38:11] so impossible
[38:13] right
[38:14] but they just believed him
[38:19] because he was the one who was called To
[38:20] The Lord right he was the one after
[38:22] Moses came Joshua he was the one who was
[38:24] anointed to be in that spot right he was
[38:27] the one who was chosen to be in that
[38:28] spot right amen
[38:32] so all those people put their trust in
[38:33] him
[38:34] oh wait
[38:36] did I say something wrong
[38:38] they put their trust in a man
[38:41] oh
[38:44] that almost seems wrong doesn't it they
[38:47] put their trust in a man
[38:49] did not Paul say follow me as I follow
[38:52] Christ
[38:53] and we can follow people
[38:56] through a holy convocation or uh maybe I
[38:59] said that wrong excuse me but as they
[39:01] are LED of the Holy Spirit we could
[39:03] follow men that are LED of the letter of
[39:05] the Holy Spirit right amen but see it
[39:08] says to try the spirits to see what they
[39:11] are
[39:12] Hallelujah so it's okay to to Rally
[39:14] behind a man knowing that it's not the
[39:17] man accomplishing these things it wasn't
[39:19] Joshua that accomplished the task of
[39:21] tearing the wall down it was the
[39:23] instruction that was given to Joshua and
[39:25] it was The Obedience so by your
[39:27] obedience to the word
[39:29] you could overcome these things
[39:33] it was those statutes
[39:35] that Joshua was following right it was
[39:38] the precept that Joshua followed
[39:41] it was the word
[39:43] that entered into his ears he said I
[39:46] heard that word that's a revelation I'm
[39:48] going to follow after that amen right
[39:51] amen did the walls come tumbling down or
[39:54] did they not
[39:57] yes sir amen
[39:59] yo we have uh
[40:02] I don't know what time it is baby I'll
[40:03] just kinda
[40:05] go through some of these
[40:07] skip a little bit
[40:13] it's a unique service everybody gets a
[40:15] little tired the evening service
[40:18] but as we talked about with knots
[40:21] nuts are not just something that you tie
[40:24] it's not just stresses in life but we
[40:26] also talked about how it could be a type
[40:28] of strong Unity praise God right yep
[40:32] there I go with that Unity again that's
[40:35] so important that we have Unity with one
[40:38] another amen amen so we can't do
[40:41] anything by ourselves we we read into
[40:43] this and uh in Proverbs how a a a
[40:49] how's it called a three-fold cord is not
[40:51] easily broken that's right so if you
[40:53] have one strand
[40:54] probably be easily broken two strands
[40:57] easily broken you find a you find a nice
[41:00] nice thick rope tightly wound rope it's
[41:03] not easily broken is it so the more
[41:05] unified we are the less we are out to be
[41:08] broken in Fellowship right The More We
[41:10] Stand upon the word of God
[41:13] you know there was a time that that
[41:15] Moses needed his brothers right but I I
[41:18] can't remember the mountain that they
[41:20] were on but you remember the battle and
[41:22] uh Moses went up onto the mountain and
[41:24] Aaron and her went up with him and he's
[41:26] up there and as long as Moses raised his
[41:28] hands
[41:30] they were victorious right but as soon
[41:32] as his hands went down what happened
[41:34] right they were in defeat right so when
[41:37] we praise the Lord we're Victorious when
[41:39] we stop praising the Lord we're in
[41:40] defeat right if you can't praise the
[41:43] Lord get somebody right we need
[41:46] encouragement by our brothers Aaron and
[41:47] her were on one side or the other
[41:49] holding up his arms right helping them
[41:51] to be victorious
[41:54] see we need that Unity with one another
[41:57] to overcome our struggles to overcome
[41:59] our strikes
[42:01] sometimes it just seems too much for us
[42:03] to bear bear ye one another's burdens
[42:05] amen
[42:09] but see like the way we were talking
[42:10] about this morning some folks have a
[42:12] hard time uh obeying the Commandments
[42:14] right everybody falls short some time or
[42:16] another uh by uh by breaking one of the
[42:20] Ten Commandments
[42:21] right but some folks have a hard time
[42:24] with the Commandments well I can't I
[42:25] can't go with the you have too many
[42:27] rules I can't go Thou shalt not do this
[42:30] Thou shalt not do that thou shalt this
[42:32] Thou shalt this
[42:35] they have a hard time with the authority
[42:37] is what they have a hard time with
[42:40] all right because they want to go do
[42:41] their own pleasure
[42:46] and that's where the the lust of the
[42:49] eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride
[42:51] of life yeah that's what breaks the
[42:53] Commandments
[42:55] is the lust of this body
[42:58] because our body desires something else
[43:00] right yes sir and sometimes we give in
[43:03] to that
[43:05] so yeah some people have a hard time
[43:07] with Commandments because they can't
[43:08] they can't take all the knots
[43:12] Thou shalt not do this Thou shalt not do
[43:14] that
[43:15] right
[43:17] but you know you still live under rules
[43:19] some way or another that's right yes yo
[43:22] if you uh I can't remember if I talked
[43:25] about this here or not I know I preached
[43:27] on this at the home church but you have
[43:28] that chop Zone where everything was uh
[43:32] uh uh the the summer of love and
[43:34] everything was free it was uh
[43:37] energy pretty much people want Anarchy
[43:39] Anarchy is without a ruler right Anarchy
[43:43] is pretty much self-rule no rules there
[43:45] are no rulers over us
[43:47] but you know what come to find out they
[43:49] still had somebody in charge over there
[43:52] yeah that's right brother oh we're not
[43:53] going to have any rulers over us we're
[43:55] all of us we're self uh uh individuals
[44:00] we're all Gonna Roll here but there's
[44:02] still somebody in charge there
[44:04] right no matter how you try to slice it
[44:07] somebody's going to try to take charge
[44:10] sir amen
[44:12] but still those people were living by
[44:14] the do's and don'ts hey guys don't let
[44:17] anybody in
[44:18] don't let anybody out
[44:21] you see where that comes from
[44:22] people don't want rule but yet they live
[44:24] on the rule that's right
[44:28] they just don't want to live under the
[44:29] right kind of a rule right amen because
[44:32] they want to fulfill their own less
[44:34] amen
[44:37] in John 14 and 15 it says
[44:40] if you love me keep my Commandments
[44:44] right now see the further you the
[44:47] further the further you get away from
[44:49] the messenger which the holy spirit is
[44:51] always a messenger
[44:55] yes brother Brandon was a messenger But
[44:57] ultimately
[44:58] even he himself said that the holy
[45:01] spirit is always the messenger the holy
[45:05] spirit is always the messenger
[45:08] but the further you get away from the
[45:10] messenger the easier it is to walk away
[45:12] and quit
[45:14] the easier it is to walk away and come
[45:16] against it amen
[45:18] see like we were talking uh earlier the
[45:20] Witnesses are getting fewer and fewer
[45:22] and the challenges are becoming harder
[45:25] right and the challenges are becoming
[45:27] more frequent
[45:28] look how bold the people are in this day
[45:31] that they're coming against
[45:33] what brother Brandon said
[45:34] where were they 20 40 years ago how come
[45:37] they weren't contesting it then
[45:39] that's right
[45:40] but now Witnesses are kind of leaving
[45:42] the scene now it's easier for these
[45:44] people to come against it just like the
[45:46] children of Israel
[45:49] just like the experience
[45:51] in the wilderness
[45:53] everybody has to have their own
[45:55] experience you have to have your own
[45:56] experience you you everybody has to have
[45:59] their own experience you can't go off of
[46:01] what mommy and daddy did right
[46:06] see it's because people aren't having
[46:08] their own experience it's just because
[46:10] they believe that when they grew up in
[46:12] the end of the message
[46:13] that's right
[46:15] well this is what I grew up believing
[46:18] well did you ever go on the back side of
[46:20] the desert
[46:22] sir like brother Brandon said that you
[46:24] have to
[46:25] right
[46:27] people want to come against preachers oh
[46:28] are you qualified did you have a holy
[46:30] ghost experience well how can you call
[46:32] yourself a Christian did you have a holy
[46:33] ghost experience
[46:35] right
[46:36] it goes the same way right yes sir yes
[46:39] sir
[46:41] not many people want to look at that one
[46:45] they just want to criticize they want to
[46:47] they've got to find something to
[46:49] criticize all right brother right so you
[46:52] know just like Janice and Jammers came
[46:53] against the word of dude just came
[46:55] against Moses right but you can't take a
[46:57] neutral ground you can't say well I'm
[46:59] just going to sit on the fence and Watch
[47:00] What Happens
[47:01] because sooner or later you're gonna
[47:03] have to make your own decision you have
[47:06] to get on one side of the fence or the
[47:08] other
[47:09] with Cora and David Janice jammers
[47:12] and they came against Moses and they're
[47:14] saying Moses you take too much upon
[47:16] yourself
[47:18] you know his father-in-law said the like
[47:21] the exact same thing
[47:23] Moses you take too much on yourself
[47:26] what was the difference between the two
[47:30] Jethro wanted to help Moses not take
[47:34] over for Moses Moses told Janice to
[47:37] Jammers court and dancing you know
[47:39] you've been giving you've been giving uh
[47:40] your Levites or whatever and you want to
[47:43] take the priesthood you want to take
[47:44] control of everything now
[47:46] when you wanted to go back to Egypt now
[47:49] you want to take control
[47:52] now that things are going pretty good
[47:54] now you want to step up
[47:57] where were you when I needed you to to
[47:59] encourage the rest of the people
[48:04] where are you that
[48:10] but the way it's been plowed already
[48:12] right
[48:14] now we want to step in and Grant the
[48:16] easy reins
[48:20] if we want to take the easy Road
[48:23] goodbye good but you know the Lord told
[48:26] Moses he said you gather every you
[48:28] gather you gather the men of Israel you
[48:30] gather everybody together
[48:32] and we're gonna we're gonna come here
[48:34] we're gonna see whose letter the Lord or
[48:36] not
[48:37] amen amen and we know what happened that
[48:39] the that the ground open up and then
[48:42] swallowed the people that were came
[48:43] against Moses
[48:45] the one that was ordained and set above
[48:48] the people
[48:51] there was there was something else I was
[48:52] gonna I was thinking of preaching this
[48:54] morning that man I can't remember the
[48:56] scriptures but it it says Thou shalt not
[48:58] come into something about not coming
[49:00] against the rulers coming Against The
[49:02] Gods and those that have ruled over you
[49:03] this I think it's back in Psalms like I
[49:05] can't remember exactly where it is but
[49:07] man I wish I remember what it was now
[49:09] because it was it would fit right here
[49:11] so you know even the scripture says
[49:13] don't come against those that I have set
[49:15] you know touch not mine anointed and do
[49:18] them no harm do my prophets no harm
[49:20] right yes sir
[49:21] so like we were talking this morning
[49:23] about the fivefold ministry
[49:26] those gifts are ordained of God to be in
[49:29] place right who who is man to try to
[49:32] take something like that out right
[49:34] right except somebody trying to take the
[49:36] place of God
[49:39] amen I'm gonna go ahead and start
[49:41] closing
[49:43] uh
[49:45] we were talking about knots right
[49:49] all right kind of uh
[49:51] hit a couple rabbit Trails but that's
[49:53] okay right
[49:54] oh there's the the let not right
[49:59] Psalm 119 133 says order my steps in thy
[50:03] word and let not any iniquity have
[50:06] dominion over me
[50:09] I love that scripture because that's my
[50:11] desire amen I want to be led by the word
[50:14] and I don't want any iniquity having
[50:16] charge I don't want to be enslaved to
[50:18] any iniquity in my life amen amen so
[50:21] when we confess our faults one to
[50:23] another we confess our faults before God
[50:26] there is therefore no more condemnation
[50:28] upon us but we are free individuals amen
[50:31] amen
[50:33] and then you have the fail not
[50:35] First Kings 8 and 56 it says blessed be
[50:38] the Lord that hath given rest unto His
[50:40] People Israel according to all that he
[50:43] promised
[50:45] there hath not failed one word of all
[50:48] his good promise which he promised by
[50:51] the hand of Moses his servant amen then
[50:54] you have the fear not
[50:57] Isaiah 41 10 it says fear thou not for I
[51:00] am with thee be not dismayed for I am
[51:03] thy God I will strengthen thee yay I
[51:06] will help Thee I will uphold thee with
[51:09] the right hand of my righteousness
[51:12] then you have the faint nut Galatians 6
[51:15] and 9. and let us not be weary and well
[51:18] doing for in due season we shall reap
[51:21] if we faint not amen see we get a little
[51:25] bit of wheat but be persevering continue
[51:27] on
[51:29] there are times that it gets so hard
[51:31] that we want to quit
[51:34] but I say keep going
[51:36] keep going amen yo you'll reap what you
[51:39] sow if you if you're sowing good things
[51:41] you're gonna reap the good things amen
[51:43] if you faint not yeah
[51:45] stay strong my brothers and sisters amen
[51:50] then you have to walketh not Psalms 1
[51:53] 1-6 it says blessed is the man that
[51:55] walketh not in the counsel of the
[51:57] ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[52:00] Sinners nor sinneth in the seed of the
[52:01] scornful but his Delight is in the law
[52:04] of the Lord and in his law does he
[52:06] meditate day and night
[52:09] and he shall be like a tree planted by
[52:11] the rivers of water that bringeth forth
[52:13] his fruit in his season his Leaf also
[52:16] shall not wither and whether whatsoever
[52:18] he doeth shall prosper see a tree
[52:20] planted by the water is going to produce
[52:22] much fruit so if you're in the water and
[52:25] the water of the word
[52:27] by being cleansed by the water of the
[52:29] word right we're uh
[52:33] we're getting into that thirst we're
[52:34] we're satisfying our thirst with the
[52:36] word of God not the things of the world
[52:40] we should produce much fruit
[52:44] verse 4 says the ungodly are not so but
[52:47] are like the chaff which the wind
[52:48] driveth away
[52:49] therefore the ungodly shall not stand in
[52:52] the Judgment nor sinners in the
[52:53] congregation of the righteous for the
[52:55] Lord knoweth the way of the righteous
[52:57] but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish
[53:02] then you have the forget not
[53:06] Psalm 103 that's right says bless the
[53:09] Lord O my soul and all that is within me
[53:13] bless His holy name amen bless the Lord
[53:17] O my soul and forget not
[53:19] all his benefits amen hallelujah who who
[53:25] forgiveth all thine iniquities
[53:28] who healeth all thy diseases who
[53:33] redeemeth thy life from destruction who
[53:36] crowneth thee with loving kindness and
[53:38] Tender Mercies who satisfy thy mouth
[53:41] with good things so that thy youth is
[53:44] renewed like the eagles
[53:46] amen hallelujah then the Forsaken nun
[53:50] Psalms 9 9-10 it says the Lord also will
[53:54] be a refuge for the oppressed a refuge
[53:58] in times of trouble
[54:00] and they that Know Thy Name will put
[54:02] their trust in thee for thou Lord has
[54:05] not forsaken them that seek thee amen
[54:08] amen amen
[54:10] praise the Lord
[54:11] just have the musicians come
[54:17] you know there was a man
[54:18] that stood up boldly one time
[54:21] they claimed that he was a prophet and
[54:23] talking about the robe that he had the
[54:24] robe on
[54:27] and then the the people realized and
[54:29] said you know what let's take them to
[54:31] Martin
[54:33] do you remember that story sir
[54:35] let's take him to Mark Martin
[54:37] we'll see if he's a real Prophet or not
[54:41] so what happened he back down
[54:44] right
[54:44] when he was faced
[54:46] with the reality when he was going to be
[54:49] exposed
[54:51] so there are men and women in this day
[54:54] that are going to sound so authoritative
[54:57] right to try to take you away to try to
[55:00] steer you away from the truth
[55:04] all that is is a scarecrow
[55:06] yes stay rooted like the tree planted by
[55:09] the water stay rooted and grounded and
[55:11] bring forth much fruit amen amen
[55:15] so a lot of those are just clouds
[55:18] threatening rain
[55:21] that's all they are is clouds
[55:23] that's right praise God they bring no
[55:25] storm they bring no Authority
[55:28] they're just rain clouds threatening
[55:30] rain
[55:31] they have no authority over you
[55:33] this is the authority over you the word
[55:36] of God and your pastor
[55:39] those are the ones that have set at
[55:41] authority over you
[55:43] spiritually speaking right
[55:47] so when some comes and they they sound
[55:49] like they have so much Authority behind
[55:51] them yeah it could sound good it could
[55:53] sound like a good argument
[55:55] no but that's what happened with the
[55:56] serpent Neve it sounded like a good a
[55:59] good argument it sounded so much like
[56:01] truth but just the one word
[56:03] that's right amen we all have we all
[56:09] have knots in our lives but don't let
[56:11] those knots be your excuses let them be
[56:13] your Stepping Stones
[56:15] don't don't use them because of all the
[56:17] knots I can't I can't live this I'm not
[56:19] good enough I'm not I'm not this I'm not
[56:22] that I'm not talented enough he's not
[56:24] looking for your talent he's looking for
[56:25] Your Surrender right amen amen amen if
[56:28] you would stand to your feet
[56:31] it doesn't matter how old you are either
[56:34] awesome
[56:35] yeah I just I love that story about
[56:37] Caleb
[56:40] 80 years old
[56:42] he said give me my Mountain that's right
[56:45] he was one who did not forget the
[56:47] promise of God he's the one who did not
[56:49] forget the benefits of God he remembered
[56:52] what was he remembered the promise that
[56:54] was given unto him
[56:55] if you do this
[56:57] if you're diligent you're obedient you
[56:59] take over the lamb
[57:01] you're going to get your portion right
[57:03] that's right you follow after me you're
[57:05] going to receive your portion now see we
[57:07] as the bride we type that double portion
[57:10] all right we're going to get that double
[57:11] portion we don't want just a portion but
[57:14] we want a lot of it right yeah we want
[57:16] more of him right yeah we want more of
[57:19] him yes sir praise God
[57:22] praise God
[57:26] I just like to read a couple quotes if
[57:28] that's okay before we close amen
[57:34] I don't want to read this Philippians 4
[57:36] 10.
[57:38] he's saying but I've rejoiced in the
[57:39] Lord greatly that now at the last year
[57:42] care of me have flourished again wherein
[57:44] you were all so careful but you lacked
[57:46] opportunity
[57:48] not that I speak in respect of want for
[57:50] I have learned and whatsoever State I am
[57:52] therewith to be content
[57:54] I know both to be amazed and I know how
[57:58] to abound everywhere and in all things I
[58:01] am instructed both to be full and to be
[58:03] hungry both to abound and to suffer need
[58:07] I could do all things through Christ
[58:09] which strengthen me so he's saying I've
[58:13] been in the low times I've been in the
[58:15] High Times I know what it's like to be
[58:17] low I know what it's like to be high but
[58:20] whatever situation I'm in there with be
[58:24] content amen and what are we going to be
[58:27] content with be content that we can say
[58:30] that we are Christians amen
[58:34] and how will they know that we are
[58:36] Christians by our love right
[58:40] now sometimes the words can uh cut real
[58:43] deep and hard but remember we're
[58:45] circumcised that's cutting the knots off
[58:47] see
[58:48] we're we're circumcised by the word of
[58:51] God and it cuts but it's good for you it
[58:54] shapes you out cut a tree back and it'll
[58:56] bear better it'll produce better fruit
[58:58] is what he's saying yes don't let too
[59:00] many Loose Ends get uh get run out on it
[59:03] that's what the what's the matter today
[59:05] we get too many Loose Ends running out
[59:07] this way and that way too many societies
[59:09] and too many of this and too much of
[59:11] that let's come back to one thing
[59:14] Calvary where we can sing with our heart
[59:17] and humbler you make yourself
[59:21] and then at another place he says and so
[59:24] here we are tonight and the place is
[59:26] converted from trying to bind one
[59:28] another by wrestling knots
[59:31] trying to bind one another
[59:34] we shouldn't be trying to bind one
[59:36] another we should be trying to liberate
[59:38] one another
[59:40] by wrestling knots and trying to to tie
[59:43] the devil in such a knot by the
[59:45] scripture he can't get out of him until
[59:46] he takes the count that's right and now
[59:48] we pray the Lord will help us to do this
[59:52] we shouldn't be trying to tie one
[59:54] another in a knot
[59:56] we should be trying to tie the devil
[59:57] into not right but when he says if if
[1:00:00] you'll just come up on this mountain and
[1:00:02] worship me but it is written
[1:00:04] right Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy
[1:00:08] God alone for the Lord God is one God
[1:00:12] bring the scripture to him amen when you
[1:00:15] bring the truth to him you tie him in
[1:00:17] knots
[1:00:19] see when we submit ourselves unto God
[1:00:22] then we could resist the devil and he
[1:00:26] will flee when we submit ourselves unto
[1:00:28] the word of God then we could use the
[1:00:30] word of God
[1:00:31] and it's a truth in our life that we can
[1:00:34] make the devil escape from us amen
[1:00:36] Hallelujah
[1:00:38] then we can bind them but it's through
[1:00:40] that submission of the word the except
[1:00:42] accepting the word
[1:00:45] now he says this and I'll be done
[1:00:47] the questions that's been on our minds
[1:00:49] how can he do it what would uh what
[1:00:52] would this uh I'm not exactly sure what
[1:00:55] he's saying but how could he do it
