[44:01] think what our flesh ones with all we
[44:04] must crucify the flesh we walk in this
[44:06] or help us in order to walk it your
[44:07] spirit today we're so grateful for your
[44:10] mercy less on the Saints with your
[44:11] spiritual essence Lord made available
[44:13] through the blood of the cross
[44:14] we're so thankful for the crops of
[44:16] America it's no means to us everything
[44:19] that's where sinless finish that's where
[44:21] our promises were purchased Lord God
[44:24] gratefully walk into those promises
[44:26] years Lord upon this earth as we
[44:30] faithfully walk on their commands thank
[44:32] you than you has a limited offspring
[44:35] you'd be glory this morning in Jesus
[44:37] Christ Nick Scherr set in series
[44:59] our child that means you go pick up your
[45:06] sister between the services so just a
[45:25] few pictures of visual I don't have one
[45:33] here at quite a few visitors at my house
[45:35] the last employees but I have time to
[45:41] study but now they call this quote you
[45:45] gotta change the font change the size
[45:46] make everything fit so they can read it
[45:49] so our eyes are not straining but praise
[45:52] the Lord I'm so grateful for God's mercy
[45:56] so let's look at the thought of reach
[45:58] and I started studying up on roofs and I
[46:00] thought my there's so many different
[46:02] applications it's all trying to get to
[46:04] some of them I have at least four
[46:05] different applications you know I like
[46:08] to get to those but we ran out of text
[46:16] and I thought it'd be best to start
[46:18] without Jesus is the root and offspring
[46:20] of date amen on let's start there with
[46:22] with roots but I first like to define
[46:25] our natural roots and to see the
[46:27] spiritual truths there you know about
[46:29] maps that you can always understand the
[46:31] spiritual by looking at the natural so I
[46:33] went to Britannica you know I went to
[46:34] some different places to try to read
[46:36] about roots and so for like that
[46:38] so I want to look at roots now in botany
[46:41] this is the protective definition it's
[46:43] the part of the plant normally
[46:45] underground so it's snowing in the
[46:46] ground not all the time but most attack
[46:48] so it's something so we're look at that
[46:51] as a spiritual type
[46:52] roots are things that are not easily
[46:54] seen to the public right the things that
[46:56] are hidden from immediate view so we're
[46:59] looking at spiritual things and it says
[47:04] its primary function so it's the part of
[47:07] a plant whose primary functions are to
[47:09] Anchorage or its
[47:12] questions are Anchorage of the plans so
[47:15] a search that's an anchor like that if I
[47:18] was says we have a hope that anchors
[47:19] beyond the veil a bet I see you can see
[47:22] the spiritual type there so it's an
[47:24] underground part not easily seen
[47:28] invisible eyes you can't see my knickers
[47:29] in heaven this morning about me my god
[47:31] even in there not visibly seen its
[47:36] primary functions are Anchorage for the
[47:38] planet absorption of water and dissolved
[47:42] minerals since the second one absorbing
[47:45] the water absorbing the word or he's God
[47:47] all the spiritual mineral something
[47:50] that's not seen on the outside it's seen
[47:53] it's not seen on the outside that's
[47:55] underneath it's a hidden thing about
[47:57] Mary's message it's a hidden the life
[47:58] raised up that's why people can come to
[48:01] church and we can come to church and we
[48:02] can sit down read our Bibles we go in
[48:04] public and have a Bible study in the
[48:05] restaurant or something like that but we
[48:09] people could act like big receiving but
[48:12] that's not where it's actually seen us
[48:14] to serve it on the outside it's a hidden
[48:15] thing on the inside because the
[48:17] Pharisees were the church more than
[48:19] anybody and yet they get it receive the
[48:20] word of the out they weren't receiving
[48:22] the water right and we're receiving the
[48:24] minerals in crisis is his messengers
[48:26] were preaching to him so it's a hidden
[48:28] thing praise done now the third thing is
[48:31] conduction of the east to the stem so
[48:34] the roots you know given Anchorage and
[48:37] soar but the third thing is they're
[48:38] they're flus you know they're flus to
[48:41] pass the water minerals up to the
[48:43] standards the rest of the plant so
[48:45] science at least in this part of the
[48:47] cyclopædia says it has those three okay
[48:50] Walmart and in certain kind of routes in
[48:52] storage or of the reserve foods so it's
[48:56] a place you can store your reserves a
[48:58] man is that in the roots and it gives
[49:01] some examples there's two kinds of two
[49:03] kinds of roots at least I listed them I
[49:07] guess I didn't study you know for hours
[49:08] and hours and ever tip of class home
[49:09] roots or binding or anything that
[49:11] apology you know but this is what I
[49:14] found this out study there's fibrous
[49:16] roots and all the roots here come from
[49:17] the very base you know of the seed there
[49:21] right from the base but the taproot is
[49:24] the one that we just
[49:25] sometimes the root acts as a storage of
[49:28] food and minerals and we like those
[49:30] don't we we like carrots and all those
[49:32] different help tap root kind of plants
[49:35] because that's storing up good things
[49:37] Springs the mornin
[49:38] that's not on the visible eye it's
[49:40] hidden underneath pretty Scott and you
[49:42] got a root that out to get it the
[49:44] blessings of that so the root
[49:46] spiritually has different applications
[49:49] now we can see the Anchorage pretty
[49:51] easily brother branham said what does
[49:54] the wind send for anyhow why does God
[49:56] send the wind run Graham said to shake
[49:58] them trees every time you shake a tree
[50:00] it loosens up the roof and it causes it
[50:03] to grow deeper and deeper I run around
[50:05] lichens that a windstorm to the Holy
[50:07] Ghost he said every time the Holy Ghost
[50:09] falls on the church and an old-fashioned
[50:11] revival it shakes up the roots like this
[50:14] so it can go rooted and grounded ready
[50:16] for the storms and trials as they come
[50:18] upon the earth you see what I are in
[50:20] Bible is so important so your rooster
[50:23] goes deeper that you can handle the
[50:24] storms and they're coming amen so
[50:27] program likens win to the Holy Ghost
[50:29] amen coming and giving you a fresh new
[50:31] Bible and that's the loosen up the roots
[50:33] so they can go down a little bit further
[50:35] praise God so you can clearly see that
[50:37] that's when you heard preached many
[50:38] times and so I haven't really everywhere
[50:41] I go everywhere I've gone I've heard
[50:42] people precess I appreciate that I love
[50:44] that that's a great trip that's
[50:45] Anchorage that's one of the main
[50:47] functions of the roots is to anchor the
[50:49] plan in the right location amen
[50:52] I want to get down to another part of
[50:56] the route it says the primary route or
[50:59] the radical is the first organ to appear
[51:02] when a seed germinates so roots start
[51:05] with the radicals called the radical
[51:07] interstate radical and it says it grows
[51:11] downward in the soil you'll remember the
[51:13] diagrams I don't have it up here I wish
[51:15] you'll read our minds we're going to get
[51:16] down you also remember the diagram of
[51:18] the seat of the embryo and there's a
[51:20] little piece of the fruit that is first
[51:22] sticking out and as soon as water hits
[51:24] that that is the part that goes directly
[51:26] down into the water I'm talking talking
[51:28] to the ground rather and begin once
[51:30] water hits it it germinates the seed and
[51:32] it pushes the radical down and it begins
[51:35] anchoring the little seedling
[51:37] see and it says the radical and some of
[51:41] these plants becomes the taproom so this
[51:42] is what the taproot because this would
[51:44] be that very beginning of the radical
[51:46] like in the original seed and it says
[51:52] here that this part of the plant or this
[51:54] plant part of the root is very important
[51:57] now I've heard this preached before but
[51:59] I never studied it it was years ago but
[52:01] roots grow in length only from their
[52:04] eddies they only grow at the end of the
[52:07] roots right so all these parts up here
[52:09] are not growing the ends are growing so
[52:12] we see how the ends around here the ends
[52:13] down here the end is the only part that
[52:16] grows so it's the initial particle right
[52:20] I'm sorry radical it's that initial
[52:21] radical the radicals the only part
[52:24] that's growing there's only part of it
[52:26] that's really moving is that initial
[52:29] root or that initial member right
[52:33] the initial members that sound familiar
[52:35] like the Bible say we have to have our
[52:37] first love you must live by our first
[52:39] love see this room will only grow deeper
[52:41] bikes first love the very first love
[52:45] that it has going to push down and
[52:46] started growing down the ground and that
[52:49] first love that makes it grow deeper in
[52:51] the Word of God amen and deeper in
[52:52] Christ that's why we cannot live off of
[52:55] a past experience we cannot go further
[52:57] from God we can only grow in God when we
[52:59] get back to our first lab amen because
[53:02] it only grows from that radical which
[53:04] later has the term called the root cap
[53:08] so the very tip of the root is covered
[53:11] by a protective pimple shade root cap
[53:14] just behind the root cap lyza ethical
[53:18] meristem a tissue of actively dividing
[53:21] cells so I want to just get look at the
[53:27] picture there's another picture of a
[53:28] plan so we have the chute of the plant
[53:30] and the bud of your of course the leaves
[53:32] down here we have the roots and here's
[53:34] the root cap I got another picture on it
[53:37] I've shown just a moment so the root cap
[53:40] the root caps are very we say from the
[53:43] cutting edge of life and I see life
[53:44] that first love an initial love you have
[53:47] for Christ
[53:48] that's the cutting edge of growing as a
[53:49] Christian your first love and it cannot
[53:52] grow unless you have your first love but
[53:56] jesus said that himself right I'll say
[53:58] it the Bible to us
[53:59] jesus said until you get back to your
[54:01] first love the first worse you'll never
[54:04] grow as a Christian the roots can't grow
[54:07] deeper down into the things of God until
[54:10] you have your first love that radical
[54:13] we'd say or that root tap there cap week
[54:16] off sorry
[54:18] that's a good buddy terms mixed up now
[54:23] look to if I can read a quote from
[54:26] brother Branham on this from God's
[54:28] provided way of healing 1954 he makes
[54:31] his statement I want you to remember it
[54:33] how many remember when Jesus cursed the
[54:35] fig tree from that the Bible said he was
[54:38] walking by and he was hungry in Mark 11
[54:41] 12 and 14 and he came to a tree victory
[54:44] it wasn't the season for the picture to
[54:46] part the but God was but Christ
[54:48] not in Christ was wanting a fruit right
[54:52] and so Jesus cursed it he said these
[54:56] words he said no man eat of the fruit
[54:58] thereof Hereafter and the disciples
[55:00] heard of Peter hurt other side was hurt
[55:01] they're going to Jerusalem they come out
[55:03] and once they come out the Bible said
[55:06] Peter looks over and he sees it dry up
[55:08] from the roots so brother man picks us
[55:12] up and he says this statement he said
[55:15] Jesus said no fruit will go off growing
[55:17] and no man will eat from henceforth he
[55:21] said now how many knows that the tree
[55:23] has a germ of life everybody does if it
[55:25] didn't it would live now watch the tree
[55:28] died from where on them said the roots
[55:31] the Bible said it was withered from the
[55:33] roots now in the root was the trees life
[55:37] [Applause]
[55:39] boy I want to make that statement as you
[55:42] look at the natural the life actually of
[55:44] the tree or plant is in the roots and
[55:47] there's only one active life that's the
[55:50] life that's in the growing part of this
[55:52] plan
[55:53] is in that root cap its first love its
[55:57] initial its initial experience with the
[56:01] grounding men its initial experience
[56:04] with water hallelujah thank you Jesus
[56:07] hey man its initial experience that's my
[56:10] program said in what house will you
[56:11] build me 65 he said though I see
[56:13] everybody declining away from the spirit
[56:15] how I longed for revival my whole life I
[56:17] longed to have that feeling ahead when I
[56:20] first got saved amen
[56:22] and she just says seek ye first the
[56:25] kingdom of God and His righteousness and
[56:27] all these things will be added unto you
[56:28] hey my mind I said the root is in the
[56:32] tree slack because after Jesus cursed it
[56:34] they come back later and there's no I'm
[56:38] sorry the roots themselves were
[56:40] withering up because the life is in the
[56:42] roots how many understand that by God's
[56:44] grace let me give you a picture I think
[56:46] God for science because if I don't read
[56:48] the Britannica and try to give you a
[56:49] picture of this I never could've done it
[56:51] but look at this nice little picture
[56:53] here's the structure of rooms you have
[56:54] this is a very roof cap down here we're
[56:56] talking about the very bottom part of
[56:57] the roots and there's no meristem and
[57:00] there's the root hairs now Ruth Harris
[57:03] increase the surface area for water and
[57:06] mineral absorption did you know that a
[57:08] lot water comes through the root hairs
[57:11] if that root trims off its hairs and you
[57:14] can have any water like that
[57:18] see those sisters if our brothers and
[57:20] our sisters cut their hair they're dead
[57:23] they're not born again right like Samson
[57:26] and become his hair it broke the
[57:28] covenants so the plant gets water
[57:31] through the hairs amen everything the
[57:36] hair counts because it's pulling in the
[57:38] Word of God it's pulling in the light
[57:40] it's pulling in the nutrients that's
[57:43] right and the meristem is the region
[57:45] where the new cells are produced so
[57:46] right here so you have the cap that
[57:48] protects the growing room don't you love
[57:50] how God protects the part of you that's
[57:52] growing aren't you glad God protects the
[57:54] light thank you this is the part that's
[57:56] actually growing it's not actually the
[57:58] tip but it's right behind the tip it's
[58:00] got to have a nice Arrowhead right
[58:02] you've got a break
[58:03] screw to breakthroughs gotta have that
[58:06] sub the breakthrough but the real life
[58:08] is behind it ray stop amen and God has
[58:12] protection for the life
[58:13] aren't you glad that our life is
[58:14] protected our life is hid in Christ amen
[58:18] hallelujah Christ is our cap and that's
[58:20] what the Holy Ghost is the cash dome
[58:23] ring cap cap so baptism of the Holy
[58:27] Ghost amen
[58:28] it's Christ who protects our life amen
[58:31] beautifully met how do you and the root
[58:34] cap protects the tip of the growing root
[58:37] Sokratis Christ that protects our the
[58:40] growth in our life and that's our first
[58:41] love
[58:42] and that's Holy Ghost love me man that's
[58:44] your Holy Ghost up because that's the
[58:46] only thing that grows unless that's the
[58:48] Holy Spirit there your love for Jesus
[58:50] and it needs protected by the capstone
[58:52] amen it's protected by the cap and it
[58:55] has to throw and push down it's going to
[58:57] take in more water our minerals and then
[58:59] the life is protected it'll push down
[59:02] further in the crisis amen hope you like
[59:05] that by the grace okay I said Jesus
[59:08] didn't speak to the leaves neither did
[59:11] he speak to the branches but he spoke to
[59:14] the life amen
[59:16] no man eat from me hence all the days of
[59:19] your life
[59:20] now that there's an interesting type in
[59:22] there brother Graham said that there's
[59:25] two things I've ever said Jesus wanted
[59:27] to show the disciples how he had power
[59:28] over all nature that's why he cursed it
[59:31] see out of season right look I said he
[59:34] wanted to happen show the disciples the
[59:36] spoken word has power over all creation
[59:37] like squirrels right turns
[59:40] that's power over squirms that's power
[59:42] over storms that's how we were fish and
[59:45] apostles that get called back to life in
[59:47] their God Jesus wanted to show that the
[59:50] spoken word has power over all creation
[59:53] the second thing you can think out of
[59:55] that is that we must be instant in
[59:57] season and out of season and Jesus
[1:00:01] showing that every tree guy only brings
[1:00:03] forth his new season but it is showing
[1:00:06] that the real type is that men are trees
[1:00:09] and then
[1:00:10] be ready no matter if they say well I'm
[1:00:12] in the season of it or not they've got
[1:00:13] to be producing the life of God because
[1:00:16] the Bible said in Psalm chapter what a
[1:00:17] man that's really planted by the rivers
[1:00:19] of waters his fruit doesn't with her so
[1:00:23] someone who's really gonna baptism of
[1:00:25] the Holy Ghost spirit born again
[1:00:26] experience his fruit doesn't wither his
[1:00:28] knees doesn't wither he's ugly producing
[1:00:31] the fruit of the Holy Spirit exam yes
[1:00:33] it's hard times like brother Brandon
[1:00:34] that he has rough times but he's
[1:00:36] constantly putting fruit husband putting
[1:00:38] forth all the time
[1:00:39] why because he know his Lord is watching
[1:00:41] him and he wants to please his Lord no
[1:00:43] matter what stage Almighty's in Hey
[1:00:47] thank you mom so my map type sis
[1:00:53] he said the tree was left standing
[1:00:56] without lighting and they types that now
[1:01:00] would it be any harder for Jesus to
[1:01:01] speak to a cancer than it would be to a
[1:01:03] tree could Jesus lightness to speak into
[1:01:07] the light to speak in the life of a
[1:01:09] cancer speak into the light for whatever
[1:01:12] problem you have how many buddy there's
[1:01:13] power and speaking the Word of God and
[1:01:16] if you read this chapter mark 11 without
[1:01:18] time to David Jesus all the Jesus whole
[1:01:21] training is on this to show them the
[1:01:24] power of the spoken word to speak the
[1:01:26] word to your situation
[1:01:29] Alleluia now those years of mother have
[1:01:32] said he said Jesus not in a raised voice
[1:01:36] but just with real thing said no man
[1:01:39] even from you sometimes Jesus lifted his
[1:01:42] voice we do miracles remember last week
[1:01:44] he said the bowing lifted up his voice
[1:01:45] and said Lazarus come forth my brother
[1:01:48] and dramatized his faith can look in a
[1:01:50] few different ways can make you look
[1:01:52] really loud and really bald but prevents
[1:01:54] in this case Jesus just walked by and
[1:01:56] said with a not a raised voice he said
[1:01:59] but just with real faith
[1:02:01] no man is from the hereafter restock see
[1:02:08] for medicine before he would teach his
[1:02:10] disciples what he did it he must show
[1:02:12] them first who he was and that's what he
[1:02:14] still does today as I've said before
[1:02:16] when an occasion Rises that needs to be
[1:02:19] God called on the steam and the way God
[1:02:21] acts on that occasion if the same
[1:02:23] occasion would ever rise again God a sac
[1:02:25] the same way that he did first or he did
[1:02:28] not he did wrong when he acted the first
[1:02:30] time he said oh it seems to be such a
[1:02:33] hard thing for people to comprehend what
[1:02:36] faith is
[1:02:37] I mean when the comprehend what faith is
[1:02:38] it's just something inside of you that
[1:02:40] just believes the word it's a substance
[1:02:44] it's something that just has to take out
[1:02:46] of this word and what is faith it's an
[1:02:48] assurance
[1:02:49] it's an inside assurance that you know
[1:02:51] God will keep his word
[1:02:52] hey man how about a man said sometimes
[1:02:57] people have a hope that is a faith I've
[1:03:00] heard many people say oh I got a lot all
[1:03:02] fake but then they're standing in the
[1:03:05] prayer line if they had that type of
[1:03:07] faith they would not feed in the prayer
[1:03:09] life it's just an emotional faith now
[1:03:14] can I say like this when someone's at
[1:03:16] the Paramount here or at any church you
[1:03:18] have a measure of faith but you're
[1:03:20] recognizing you need more faith just my
[1:03:23] man said when you come up for prayer
[1:03:24] you're saying I went with your faith
[1:03:26] with the ministers thing my brother up
[1:03:29] said if you have perfect faith you don't
[1:03:31] even need to get the prayer line but it
[1:03:34] might be God's will though to bring you
[1:03:36] up to a prayer line because the Avenue
[1:03:39] might be the laying on of hands or might
[1:03:41] be the anointing of the oil or might be
[1:03:43] just speaking the word like we see with
[1:03:44] Jesus where you don't have to go to
[1:03:45] prayer line just speak the word God has
[1:03:48] all these channels for the supernatural
[1:03:49] all these channels for faith the thing
[1:03:52] to do is be in harmony with Christ amen
[1:03:55] and we can understand what basis so
[1:03:58] Jesus in this case courser the tree
[1:04:00] doesn't raise his voice it just said no
[1:04:02] fruit from you on your after and the
[1:04:05] lattice with ready piece of Lazarus no
[1:04:07] farm and the man that was dead for days
[1:04:09] came out alive amen
[1:04:10] say lipsti man let him go up sorry the
[1:04:14] power of the risen Christ amen now I
[1:04:20] want to just that was just fine it made
[1:04:22] my foundation there I just wanted you to
[1:04:24] see sometimes as we get further I'm not
[1:04:26] sure the way the Holy Spirit would take
[1:04:28] it sometimes I'm really surprised and
[1:04:29] then the service will hunt
[1:04:30] no this way I spent so much time on that
[1:04:33] and church also I could say it's got to
[1:04:35] believe in him the Holy Spirit we're
[1:04:37] just trying to follow the leadership
[1:04:38] with the Holy Spirit
[1:04:40] now I prepared up these four
[1:04:42] illustrations I know there's more
[1:04:43] because I found a fifth one a fifth one
[1:04:45] is the roots are representative of
[1:04:48] Israel and then put that one up there
[1:04:50] but these are the four I've studied up
[1:04:52] the first illustration of roots is
[1:04:54] Christ is the root which we read for our
[1:04:58] text the second one our hunt is the
[1:05:01] ground that takes in seeds that produce
[1:05:03] roots that's what I have the most fun
[1:05:05] right here the third one is I haven't
[1:05:07] develop this top I got a good thought
[1:05:08] I'm just kind of waiting for the Lord to
[1:05:09] reveal we are rooted in Christ so we're
[1:05:12] the plant so this one Christ is the
[1:05:15] plant and this one were the ground that
[1:05:18] takes two plants and the third one
[1:05:21] Christ is the crowded where the plants
[1:05:23] the fourth one the church is the branch
[1:05:26] that's attached to Christ the tree the
[1:05:28] branches he's the branch knife he's the
[1:05:31] branch and so forth a fifth one is
[1:05:33] Israel as the tree or as the branch so
[1:05:36] any good time we get that woke down just
[1:05:37] on that one way here so but if you study
[1:05:40] the word roots off of the Bible this is
[1:05:42] what I found so well with the highlights
[1:05:44] of these by the grace of Lord now I want
[1:05:49] you look at how Christ is the root or
[1:05:52] the root we read revelation 22:16 I just
[1:05:56] found this quote here I hope this is a
[1:05:58] blessing to you I just was so blessed by
[1:06:01] this this work is a revelation 22:16
[1:06:04] said I Jesus have sent mine angel to
[1:06:07] testify unto you these things in the
[1:06:09] churches I am the root and the offspring
[1:06:12] of David the bright and morning star
[1:06:16] amen so Jesus says I'm the root of David
[1:06:20] and I'm the offspring of David so we go
[1:06:23] back to that picture now if I go back to
[1:06:25] that picture just let me do it okay yeah
[1:06:30] Christ is the root and he's the
[1:06:34] offspring he's gonna be that bug that
[1:06:35] turns into a flower or fruit or whatever
[1:06:37] it is Christ said I'm the root and the
[1:06:40] offspring of David so David was that
[1:06:43] natural
[1:06:45] but the but where David came from was a
[1:06:48] seed praise God or a light and Jesus
[1:06:52] says I am that seed because I am the
[1:06:55] root in other words I'm the beginning
[1:06:57] and the ending praise God
[1:07:01] you came out of God and you go back to
[1:07:04] God praising Christ is the root of David
[1:07:08] hallelujah so Christ is the root and
[1:07:11] he's the offspring so we win our lives
[1:07:15] you have to make sure that if the court
[1:07:17] of the stem here we got to make sure
[1:07:18] that we're taking in right we're taking
[1:07:21] in all the water nutrients that the
[1:07:24] roots are bringing to us how many
[1:07:27] thankful that you come to church or you
[1:07:28] read your Bible and you feel God giving
[1:07:31] you strength
[1:07:31] that's the roots bringing you live a
[1:07:34] minute how did it go I feel it all the
[1:07:37] time and I hope you can go to when
[1:07:39] you're down and discouraged you feel
[1:07:41] life coming in I was at it's the roof
[1:07:43] Christ
[1:07:44] bringing you the nutrients that's needed
[1:07:46] for you to produce what you're supposed
[1:07:48] to produce amen exactly right and in the
[1:07:52] offspring or the fruit that you produce
[1:07:54] it's actually Christ own life in your
[1:07:57] life
[1:07:57] it's Christ works in your life it's
[1:08:00] Christ working for you as Christ is the
[1:08:04] root and the offspring of David now we
[1:08:09] know of course that can represent Israel
[1:08:12] as well the root of David and so forth
[1:08:14] but we're a part of that and I'm not
[1:08:17] gonna really preach on that too much
[1:08:18] well when I just read this quote here
[1:08:20] from brother Branham let me look at draw
[1:08:24] a visual again here Christ is the root
[1:08:26] now let me show this picture before
[1:08:28] you've probably seen it before when I've
[1:08:30] taught on restoration of the bride tree
[1:08:32] I was anybody here well that's been a
[1:08:33] quite a few years ago I don't know Hosea
[1:08:35] members okay good memory brother praise
[1:08:37] the Lord
[1:08:37] I showed this picture it's one from
[1:08:39] brother Ron Malenko from the Philippines
[1:08:41] this is the restoration the body bride
[1:08:44] tree
[1:08:44] this is Pentecost acts chapter two
[1:08:46] Apostolic Faith there's the timeline on
[1:08:48] the side
[1:08:49] does this look pretty clear you didn't
[1:08:51] understand you started off with the real
[1:08:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost and you had
[1:08:55] all these things just about back your
[1:08:56] Balaam is with me
[1:08:57] that church age book the mother harlot
[1:08:59] nations Baptist you know pilgrim
[1:09:03] Holiness Nazarenes you and I believe
[1:09:06] we're up here I believe you're up here
[1:09:07] at the very top the boats have eaten all
[1:09:10] these branches right but if this tree
[1:09:13] under puts forth another branch it'll be
[1:09:15] at apostolic branch amen
[1:09:16] that's right and so we believe we're up
[1:09:18] here about the grace of the Lord and I
[1:09:23] want to just read this close I think you
[1:09:25] know in a huff understand you or help
[1:09:27] you understand because Christ is the
[1:09:29] Christ is the life in here as well
[1:09:31] Christ is the light that's coming up
[1:09:33] into the tree aren't you glad be
[1:09:34] attached aren't you glad to be grafted
[1:09:36] in the light of Christ praise God and
[1:09:39] how do we know from EMSA look at the
[1:09:42] approve your press on the producer
[1:09:43] that's how you know if this is bringing
[1:09:46] forward apples when it's an orange tree
[1:09:48] then that's a gratitude branch it's not
[1:09:50] from the original we need to see our
[1:09:52] lives producing what the Bible said
[1:09:53] we're supposed to produce a man with a
[1:09:56] fruit of the spare the gifts of the
[1:09:57] Spirit the love of God the mercy of God
[1:09:59] the patience the long-suffering the
[1:10:01] character of Christ the stature of the
[1:10:03] perfect man amen
[1:10:05] all this word for our day we should be
[1:10:07] manifesting in this hour amen exactly
[1:10:10] right now I want to just take the bullet
[1:10:13] off of this and look at the life of
[1:10:14] Christ programs of this God is
[1:10:17] determined that his vine won't die
[1:10:20] so God's determined this will done this
[1:10:23] is from playing the vine and where to
[1:10:25] play at 1959 so god plucked it up out of
[1:10:29] those creeks and fills it with the Holy
[1:10:31] Ghost and it comes down in Jesus name
[1:10:33] there that church can Paul say and live
[1:10:36] and enjoy and feel the Friends of the
[1:10:38] Living God
[1:10:39] watching him move and do things that he
[1:10:41] did when he Reich was when he was here
[1:10:42] on earth she'd understand that after
[1:10:44] Christ died he put his life in this tree
[1:10:46] and as a Pentecostal treated it was the
[1:10:49] only good but then an organization came
[1:10:50] up but then God cut it off right
[1:10:52] denominated so it died
[1:10:54] and another one comes up and when they
[1:10:56] denominated dives keep coming up but
[1:10:58] it's pulsating through the life of
[1:11:00] Christ now he says
[1:11:04] he says this Jesus was the lamb slain
[1:11:07] before the foundation of the world
[1:11:09] before there was the world he was with
[1:11:11] God he was the root and offspring of
[1:11:14] David the Morningstar the lily the
[1:11:16] valley that he must now look at this
[1:11:18] look what brother says about Christ I
[1:11:19] want you to take your mind off this and
[1:11:21] just put your thought on the life of
[1:11:23] Christ brother Graham said Christ roots
[1:11:26] are wrapped he said his roots are
[1:11:30] wrapped around God around the throne of
[1:11:33] God and around the kingdom of God his
[1:11:36] roots are wrapped his life spread forth
[1:11:39] to the earth so crisis like a tree in
[1:11:43] the throne of God which at a picture I
[1:11:44] could put up your mind on Christ was
[1:11:46] like a tree in heaven and his roots were
[1:11:48] all wrapped around the throne of God
[1:11:50] amen so that was his home he'd said
[1:11:53] that's where he was planted my brother
[1:11:55] never said this he said his roots are
[1:11:58] wrapped his life spread forth to the
[1:12:00] earth so his life grew down to there so
[1:12:02] he grew from heaven down to earth and He
[1:12:06] gave His life that he might go back to
[1:12:09] the roots so can I say like this Christ
[1:12:12] was a separate tree when he was on the
[1:12:14] earth around 33 Anki neveress a covered
[1:12:19] he does agree with that he was like a
[1:12:21] tree he was not a street right but when
[1:12:25] he died that tree was cut up from
[1:12:27] Graham's net but he said but he gave His
[1:12:32] life that he might go back to the roots
[1:12:34] of the by the Holy Spirit and Paul say
[1:12:38] again to bring forth branches out of
[1:12:40] this fund so Christ was a separate tree
[1:12:44] they cut him down he died right as his
[1:12:47] roots rock rap to heaven he was
[1:12:49] connected to heaven so are you and I
[1:12:51] obviously when we have the Holy Ghost we
[1:12:54] are without fault before the throne of
[1:12:56] God and the Bible said all the chewed
[1:12:58] all the truth of God about the outfit
[1:13:00] he's training them for them at the
[1:13:02] throne of God their faces do always hold
[1:13:04] the face of my father
[1:13:05] hey I don't know where they are but
[1:13:07] there's theophanies up there that always
[1:13:09] behold the throne of God and every child
[1:13:11] got a salami smell that the oppening he
[1:13:17] said but he gave His life so Christ was
[1:13:19] a separate tree Davis like that he might
[1:13:21] go back to the roots and this way then
[1:13:23] he went back to the root of the bride
[1:13:25] screaming said he says which is this
[1:13:29] church showing for the same results that
[1:13:32] he did when he was on earth and to make
[1:13:34] him the same yesterday today in forever
[1:13:36] o church living God believed as it's
[1:13:38] truth there he is
[1:13:40] when the true Spirit of God comes upon
[1:13:43] the believer
[1:13:43] whatever the scripture says he'll say
[1:13:47] Amen why is the Holy Ghost that wrote
[1:13:51] the Bible is in him pulsating his life
[1:13:54] on oh yeah you don't care who's sitting
[1:13:57] around and what anybody else says it's
[1:13:59] always did meet with the word he says so
[1:14:01] it always connect with the word and
[1:14:02] always and always have harmony with the
[1:14:05] Word of God so Christ was a tree cut
[1:14:07] down his life came back down to this
[1:14:10] tree and he's the life of this street
[1:14:12] bringing life into the bride tree and
[1:14:14] here we are at the end time putting
[1:14:15] forth the final fruit to the final age
[1:14:18] exactly right now what you've read this
[1:14:26] quote here let's first go to Matthew 13
[1:14:33] now let's first go to Matthew 13 now I'm
[1:14:35] going to transition to this part like I
[1:14:36] said I've got an hour I got thirty
[1:14:38] minutes of time flies halfway done I saw
[1:14:42] the other two take the last half hour
[1:14:43] let's do this our heart as brown for the
[1:14:45] roots that's going to hear this very
[1:14:47] familiar portion well let's read it
[1:14:48] again so you know God loves public
[1:14:51] reading of Scripture could you then when
[1:14:53] Moses first got the law he read all of
[1:14:55] it in front of everybody
[1:14:56] Joshua came to the land he read a public
[1:14:58] reading in front of everybody Ezra
[1:14:59] Nehemiah Josiah
[1:15:01] when they found the law of God they
[1:15:02] would take the whole day just read the
[1:15:03] whole Bible to everybody would you like
[1:15:06] that that's what we do we don't read the
[1:15:08] whole Bible we read persons Amen and
[1:15:10] preach the anointed word that we are
[1:15:12] feeling inspired by amen Matthew 13 God
[1:15:16] loves the public reading the scripture
[1:15:17] Jesus stands there and says this day
[1:15:19] description is fulfilled amen loves our
[1:15:21] reading of Scripture now I want to go to
[1:15:24] this thought here
[1:15:25] this is the parable of the sower you
[1:15:27] America me with it
[1:15:29] Matthew 13 3 and he spake many things
[1:15:32] unto them in parables saying behold a
[1:15:34] sower went forth and when he sowed some
[1:15:36] seeds fell by the way side and the fowls
[1:15:40] came by and devoured them up some fell
[1:15:45] upon stony places where they had not
[1:15:47] much earth and forthwith they sprang up
[1:15:50] because they had no deepness of the
[1:15:53] earth and when the Sun was up they were
[1:15:57] scorched and because they had no root
[1:15:58] they withered away so they had no
[1:16:02] deepness of Earth they had no minerals
[1:16:04] nutrients no Anchorage no place to be
[1:16:08] anchored so they had no root you got to
[1:16:12] have a ground before he could have a
[1:16:13] seat right yeah that kind of a place
[1:16:14] with the sea now verse 7 and some fell
[1:16:18] among thorns and the thorns sprung up
[1:16:19] and choked them and other fell into the
[1:16:21] ground and brought forth fruit some
[1:16:23] hundredfold some sixtyfold some
[1:16:25] thirtyfold who hath who hath ears to
[1:16:28] hear it on here now let's go down to
[1:16:30] verse 18 18 here he therefore the power
[1:16:34] of the soul when any one heareth the
[1:16:37] word the kingdom and understandeth it
[1:16:38] not then cometh the wicked one and
[1:16:40] catcheth away that which was sown in his
[1:16:42] heart this is he which received seed by
[1:16:45] the way side so we have wayside hearts
[1:16:47] right we're very foreigners
[1:16:48] some hearts are this way side the word
[1:16:50] just lays there and safety to come and
[1:16:53] take it out right away now verse 20 but
[1:16:57] he that receiveth the seed into the
[1:16:59] stony places the same is he that heareth
[1:17:01] the word and anon with joy receiveth
[1:17:04] this person actually has emotional
[1:17:08] response to the word so a rocky heart it
[1:17:12] can actually have a rut motional
[1:17:13] response to be excited about the word
[1:17:14] from the one your brother Graham said
[1:17:16] the stony heart was he said that was a
[1:17:19] person in denomination like the Roman
[1:17:20] Catholic Church he said because they say
[1:17:22] up on Peter upon this rock I'll build my
[1:17:25] church and it's a stony place so brother
[1:17:28] I said this is someone who's like a
[1:17:30] denominational believer that doesn't
[1:17:32] want to go any deeper they're like a
[1:17:34] Peter or a misinterpretation of Peters
[1:17:37] rock you know that's
[1:17:38] it is the stone wall this rock they're
[1:17:40] thinking about natural rocks right there
[1:17:42] interpreting the word and actually
[1:17:44] instead of spiritually so we don't want
[1:17:46] to be a make-believe Church pepper we
[1:17:48] want to be a real pure heart
[1:17:49] appreciative animal now verse 21 yet he
[1:17:54] had no Ruth himself but dureth for a
[1:17:55] while for when tribulation or
[1:17:57] persecution arises because of the word
[1:17:59] by and by he's offended
[1:18:02] so when there's no soil there's no no
[1:18:05] experience in Christ there's no roots
[1:18:07] there's no light the light doesn't get
[1:18:08] to push down into the Word of God what
[1:18:11] happens a little little persecution
[1:18:14] comes and the person gets offended at
[1:18:15] the word at the word they're gonna print
[1:18:18] out the word because they're not they're
[1:18:20] not deep in the word because the
[1:18:23] previous verse Jesus said this is the
[1:18:24] deepness of the Holy Spirit right the
[1:18:27] deepness of the word so if people don't
[1:18:30] get taken deeper into the word when
[1:18:33] tribulation comes they have no hankering
[1:18:34] and no foundation the life can't grow
[1:18:38] and they get offended at the word now
[1:18:42] verse 20 verse 9 22 he also that
[1:18:45] received the seed among the thorns is he
[1:18:47] that hears the word and the care of this
[1:18:49] world and the deceitfulness of riches
[1:18:50] choke the word and become he becometh
[1:18:52] unfruitful this is the one that's gonna
[1:18:54] be our biggest trial right to make sure
[1:18:56] our hearts have all the all the cares of
[1:18:58] the world out right because they choke
[1:19:02] the word they don't let the word grow
[1:19:03] right they take the light they take the
[1:19:06] water from the root cap right from the
[1:19:08] roots the root hairs their take they're
[1:19:10] pulling those resources away something's
[1:19:12] pulling the way my tied with the water
[1:19:15] something's falling away my time to hear
[1:19:18] the word who got my mind my ability to
[1:19:21] receive the Word of God something's
[1:19:22] hindering me from hearing the preaching
[1:19:24] I'm not received it like I used to it's
[1:19:27] a care of the world is something of the
[1:19:30] world corny Jesus and it becomes
[1:19:32] unfruitful we don't see the fruit of
[1:19:34] spirit verse 23 we neither receive a
[1:19:36] seat in the good ground to see they hear
[1:19:38] at the word and understandeth it which
[1:19:39] also beareth fruit and bringeth forth
[1:19:42] some a hundredfold some sixty and some
[1:19:45] thirty and that beautiful look I said
[1:19:50] this is
[1:19:51] the seed shall possess the gate
[1:19:52] obscenities 61 let's be the hundredfold
[1:19:58] everyone don't say he's on a 100 fold
[1:20:01] I've always thought that but brother
[1:20:02] have said that let's be 100 400 be
[1:20:05] hundredfold let's go over he said let's
[1:20:08] go way over so see we don't want to take
[1:20:11] a small step into Christianity we want
[1:20:13] to go all the way into cruciate man we
[1:20:15] don't want to go
[1:20:15] shallow Christianity we want to go all
[1:20:17] the way then he says and let's sell out
[1:20:21] everything from the world and look to
[1:20:24] Christ and believe him with all of our
[1:20:28] that's how you become 100 fold according
[1:20:31] about the brand you selling everything
[1:20:33] to the world go deep as deep in Christ
[1:20:36] but leave Christ's word with all our
[1:20:37] heart and you can't believe what God
[1:20:39] Albania I want to just read - so you can
[1:20:47] see brother Graham said he said that's
[1:20:48] how these miracles happen when you sell
[1:20:50] out become 104 so now I'm around
[1:20:53] connects miracle working to 100-volt
[1:20:54] selling out all for Christ that's how
[1:20:57] the power of God moves among us I don't
[1:21:00] believe that is when there's no roots of
[1:21:03] bitterness this is where I'm going with
[1:21:05] roots everything is clean now and the
[1:21:09] Holy Spirit can work through us then we
[1:21:11] become a channel praise God if I could
[1:21:15] go back to my picture we become a
[1:21:17] channel to push out buzz and fruits of
[1:21:19] God and works of God well we have all
[1:21:21] the flues cleaned out amen when we read
[1:21:24] evil we have no roots of bitterness we
[1:21:27] can receive all the Word of God when
[1:21:29] we're full of the Word of God
[1:21:30] and Paul said don't just have a little
[1:21:32] bit of the spirit he said be filled with
[1:21:34] the spirit speaking to yourselves in
[1:21:36] Psalms spiritual hymns and testimonies
[1:21:39] right giving God the glory
[1:21:41] our lips let's always keep the praises
[1:21:44] of God on this man right if not we're
[1:21:48] not going to produce trying to push out
[1:21:49] the right thing that's the way to be 140
[1:21:51] said all right
[1:21:59] so I think we can we have a pretty good
[1:22:01] understanding this now I just have a few
[1:22:03] pictures I mean I just found these on
[1:22:04] the internet and this by the church
[1:22:05] these these were really nice nobody can
[1:22:08] go deeper in God and we want to grow
[1:22:10] more fruitful in God's those are the two
[1:22:12] the X&Y there that's the the deeper you
[1:22:17] go got the four types of grounds you
[1:22:19] know the deeper you go in Christ of
[1:22:21] course the more rich you have yeah this
[1:22:24] is wonder that we're talking about here
[1:22:25] no get up a little depth depth but no
[1:22:29] fruit right because they got roots but
[1:22:32] they just got their getting their roots
[1:22:34] robbed the life is not able to grow and
[1:22:36] push out right because it's being robbed
[1:22:38] it's been starved a person who's playing
[1:22:41] in Christ but yet they're starved by the
[1:22:43] Peace of the world
[1:22:44] and the last issue the depth eliminating
[1:22:48] the weeds and you bring forth a very
[1:22:50] fruitful seasons that's what I would be
[1:22:52] right there 30 60 hundred don't you
[1:22:54] here's just another way to look at they
[1:22:56] give you another visual face blinders
[1:22:59] these people are totally blind in the
[1:23:00] faith the value of God's message is not
[1:23:02] understood disregarded well I don't I
[1:23:04] don't pay attention to message the hour
[1:23:06] who cares about the message who cares
[1:23:08] about the preaching of the word rocky
[1:23:10] faith the rocky faith is this
[1:23:11] contentment in surface faith in God's
[1:23:13] service I'm saying I go to church it
[1:23:18] skips dedication to death needed to
[1:23:20] stand firm because it doesn't have any
[1:23:22] root right the roots aren't able to grow
[1:23:24] they're not very hard in the Word of God
[1:23:29] the faith rebel ID said it like these
[1:23:32] illustrations the faith rebel is someone
[1:23:34] that destructively follows worldly
[1:23:36] priorities to compete with faith in God
[1:23:39] as primary they don't put God first yeah
[1:23:44] they do some things that pertain to God
[1:23:46] because they're rooted there's name
[1:23:48] stuff roots right have something like we
[1:23:51] say like a poulos version right they
[1:23:52] have some life but they're not producing
[1:23:54] the real fruit in the out and then those
[1:23:58] of that remaining faith faith that
[1:23:59] remains they have enduring faith in
[1:24:01] Jesus and they root for the
[1:24:03] understanding and practices God's Word
[1:24:06] I'm so glad to practice God's Word man
[1:24:07] amen
[1:24:09] I think I'll leave that but that's my
[1:24:11] last image if I go yeah I click it
[1:24:14] that's the end of the show so I'll leave
[1:24:15] that up there till we close I got a few
[1:24:17] minutes here like five minutes by the
[1:24:19] grace of Lord now let me read this quote
[1:24:22] from Y 1961 I think this will help you
[1:24:24] these code tell you Grady's down in it
[1:24:26] brother Branham was the light of the
[1:24:28] Allah without that light how we going to
[1:24:31] see so when he preaches on the scripture
[1:24:33] it ought to bring more light to the
[1:24:35] scripture of course we can understand
[1:24:36] that scripture I've never said no to you
[1:24:39] people that wanted to renew the joy of
[1:24:41] your salvation he's at an altar call I
[1:24:44] never feel like that I want to restore
[1:24:46] the joy of your salvation and to you
[1:24:50] somewhere you've lost joy think back
[1:24:53] what you did
[1:24:53] did you neglect prayer meeting neglect
[1:24:56] reading the Bible neglect Brandon hold
[1:24:59] asking the blessing at the table don't
[1:25:01] never do that that's so unbecoming to
[1:25:03] Christians to neglect any of these
[1:25:06] things pray anywhere see and if you ever
[1:25:12] let that left that joy that whenever we
[1:25:16] did it out what root of bitterness come
[1:25:18] in
[1:25:20] so he said Joy's like a plant to ease
[1:25:22] that the joys like a fruit we know right
[1:25:24] so if you don't see joy upon your planet
[1:25:26] he says see what to see what's growing
[1:25:28] up in your heart my brother man said
[1:25:31] remember when a man is saved and gets
[1:25:35] even be said gets eternal life in your
[1:25:37] heart that's God and as you're able to
[1:25:41] push out all the roots of bitterness
[1:25:42] then God begins to spread in you then
[1:25:45] you become a son of God a man was made
[1:25:50] to be God did you know that he's the
[1:25:52] image of God he's a son of God he's like
[1:25:55] him he was given a domain and you know
[1:25:57] program said that he said the earth
[1:26:00] wasn't made for God to rule he said the
[1:26:02] earth was made for man to rule praise
[1:26:04] the Lord
[1:26:05] that's where God placed at is it you
[1:26:07] rule you you be the dominion over this
[1:26:09] God already rules had an earth and every
[1:26:12] amen having is my throne urges my
[1:26:15] footstool we are here on the earth to
[1:26:18] rule over the earth to rule over sin
[1:26:21] temptation wickedness unbelief trials
[1:26:25] perish the world where to rule over all
[1:26:26] these things aren't you glad to rule
[1:26:28] over Canaan priest a king will rule over
[1:26:32] these things as we preach on that
[1:26:34] numerous times he says now when you
[1:26:41] become a son of God a daughter of God
[1:26:43] begin you begin to grow in the grace of
[1:26:45] God the Holy Spirit begins to build his
[1:26:48] kingdom within you now if you greet the
[1:26:52] Holy Spirit somewhere then go right back
[1:26:54] and think in your mind what did I start
[1:26:56] doing neglecting church did I start
[1:26:59] fussing with another denomination
[1:27:02] another church and that will impact your
[1:27:04] church right if you pick on somebody
[1:27:06] from another church no affect your
[1:27:08] church did I start picking on this one
[1:27:12] doing this to my neighbor he brings your
[1:27:13] neighbor's involved if you did that's
[1:27:17] what's acted out
[1:27:18] so it's kept your roots from going
[1:27:20] deeper go and say God I'm sorry
[1:27:24] I'll go right back and make that thing
[1:27:26] right I will go and do it
[1:27:27] then the Jordan will come back to your
[1:27:29] salvation the Holy Spirit just flew
[1:27:31] right up on the rafter he's ready to fly
[1:27:34] back down again anytime you want him to
[1:27:36] come back he does the leading praise God
[1:27:42] remember said forgive us of our sins
[1:27:43] this is an Abraham 1961 that those that
[1:27:46] have sinned against us may there be not
[1:27:48] one root of bitterness left in our
[1:27:50] hearts anyway may the Holy Spirit urge
[1:27:53] our lives and are conscious that this
[1:27:55] word that were fixing the Breitbart
[1:27:57] might come anointed it by the spirit he
[1:27:59] said you circumcise the lips and the
[1:28:02] ears it here that it might not fall upon
[1:28:04] shallow ground we don't to be shallow
[1:28:06] Christians right or upon rocks that be
[1:28:09] packed away by the birds of the air may
[1:28:11] it fall into good ground of faith and
[1:28:14] bring forth a hundredfold amen praise
[1:28:21] the Lord I'm reading these I wanted to
[1:28:24] look at the hearts the condition of the
[1:28:25] heart
[1:28:28] let me read this this is from Jehovah
[1:28:31] Tiger Parks who knows today way that we
[1:28:32] became by God's grace we know that every
[1:28:34] seed a promise of God will bring forth
[1:28:36] of its kind if it strikes the right
[1:28:38] ground to see that the heart the ground
[1:28:41] that's prepared ready all the rocks has
[1:28:43] been thrown out and the roots and the
[1:28:45] bitterness and the selfishness and the
[1:28:48] indifference and jealousy has all been
[1:28:50] crumbed out and the root of Ernest has
[1:28:54] spreads up that sometimes so spoils the
[1:28:56] thing that God is trying to do see God
[1:29:00] is trying to do something in our lives
[1:29:01] but if we let anything spring up that's
[1:29:04] not pure word it hinders what God is
[1:29:07] trying to do in our lives we preach on
[1:29:10] that land with rewards people can lose
[1:29:12] part their Lord
[1:29:13] or they could lose all their reward and
[1:29:15] still be safe like Saul he lost all of
[1:29:18] his reward but he was saved at the end
[1:29:19] there's so many Bible examples that we
[1:29:22] could show he said we break out that we
[1:29:27] won't be a money that won't be among us
[1:29:30] but that the good word will find good
[1:29:32] ground in these hearts praise God
[1:29:38] man praise and to whom shall we go 1960
[1:29:42] right at this hour Lord we pray that
[1:29:44] you'll pull out every green fire every
[1:29:47] root of bitterness and all of this
[1:29:48] belief from the hearts of the people
[1:29:49] that the word might all ungood on
[1:29:52] goodrich fertilized soil that I'm
[1:29:55] bringing forth great results to this
[1:29:57] people I'm gonna see results in your
[1:29:58] life results of the word of you you're
[1:30:01] believing the word that you planted in
[1:30:03] your heart and lips I'm going to see the
[1:30:05] fruit of that calm come on
[1:30:06] that's his prayer Lord pull out anything
[1:30:10] that would hinder your your will for my
[1:30:14] life ah
[1:30:15] go to Hebrews 12:1 Hebrews 12:1 to
[1:30:23] Hebrews 12:14
[1:30:34] Hebrews 12:14 it says I studied on
[1:30:36] routes that just all these illustrations
[1:30:38] I thought had gone
[1:30:39] Christ says the route use our cap he's
[1:30:43] on route cap praise the Lord
[1:30:44] and then also shown out of hearts look
[1:30:46] at the routes then we can get other ones
[1:30:48] to Hebrews 12:14 II follow a peace with
[1:30:52] all men and holiness you story everybody
[1:30:55] that you have peace does you have any
[1:30:56] wars anybody you have peace and holiness
[1:30:59] without which no man shall see the Lord
[1:31:01] looking diligently lest any man fail of
[1:31:05] the grace of God
[1:31:07] see grace will never fail you but you
[1:31:09] could avail grace right and you've been
[1:31:12] erased by not obeying the Word of God
[1:31:15] lest any root of bitterness springing up
[1:31:17] trouble you and thereby many be defiled
[1:31:22] so root of bitterness just doesn't hurt
[1:31:25] one person it hurts a lot of people
[1:31:27] right right army lest there be any
[1:31:33] fornicator or profane person as Esau who
[1:31:37] for one morsel of meat sold his
[1:31:38] birthright so she chose Esau was a man
[1:31:40] who had a root of bitterness he was
[1:31:42] bitter against the birthright for ever
[1:31:45] reason remember we went over when did we
[1:31:47] go over it was it last Sunday it was
[1:31:48] Wednesday night with the trailer sermon
[1:31:50] you remember that we showed how Esau he
[1:31:53] hated he hated the things of God he
[1:31:55] wasn't married he's a woman just to make
[1:31:58] his mom and dad upset right after he
[1:32:01] sought out the birthright for just up a
[1:32:03] meal ticket he sold it out and then I
[1:32:06] remember Rebecca said Rebecca said all
[1:32:08] my life is in vain unless Jacob marries
[1:32:10] a real Christian my life as a mother's
[1:32:13] in vain unless my children walk in the
[1:32:15] truth SUV are design you want to see
[1:32:17] everyone in this church walking truth
[1:32:19] you have nowhere in Jordan to see the
[1:32:21] children walking truth and you and I
[1:32:23] have the children understand it's not
[1:32:26] just by her I want to see my children
[1:32:27] walk in truth I'd have no greater joy
[1:32:29] than that but as a church we are the
[1:32:31] children of God and we have no grandeur
[1:32:33] to us at church when we see everybody
[1:32:35] walking in the word
[1:32:36] exactly right amen but if we let a root
[1:32:40] of bitterness or root oh look at this
[1:32:41] later of malice and he root brother up
[1:32:44] said anything give me a root a root of
[1:32:46] luster rid of greedy I rid of
[1:32:48] worldliness anything that gets in there
[1:32:50] it won't just defiled a person what
[1:32:52] defiles everybody
[1:32:53] that's exactly right just like in the
[1:32:55] garden yo eat your guard I could still
[1:32:57] do that recently wait my garden it
[1:32:59] really turned into an awful mess of
[1:33:00] weeds so I weeded on Thursday night and
[1:33:03] we didn't took about a hour just weed it
[1:33:05] all around and got it off phenom I had
[1:33:08] to wait for the inspiration they need to
[1:33:09] do that but and then the energy I guess
[1:33:12] but see without without a clean heart a
[1:33:17] person's life instead of blessing other
[1:33:19] people at the files of the people and it
[1:33:22] defiles many I have to say but brother
[1:33:26] Graham said and you know this from the
[1:33:28] adoption series brother have said
[1:33:29] unconfessed sin the church if somebody
[1:33:31] doesn't confess his sin will cause the
[1:33:33] church to bitterly fail any unconfessed
[1:33:37] sin and program said then God will hold
[1:33:40] the congregation accountable on the
[1:33:43] judgment that's that's really serious
[1:33:44] Church and what was in Bible example
[1:33:47] akin so Aikens rude up what greed was
[1:33:52] caught green right he had a root of
[1:33:53] greed he hid the Babylonian garments and
[1:33:55] all the things that he took that not
[1:33:57] only defiled him and his family but it
[1:33:59] killed what thirty other matter was
[1:34:01] eighteen I forget how many was so that
[1:34:04] was a rude that didn't get up rooted he
[1:34:06] failed to repent he failed to make that
[1:34:08] riot you see that and so in any root of
[1:34:12] sinned us left under the best it defiles
[1:34:15] others my man said your bad attitude are
[1:34:18] my bad attitude toward the work and keep
[1:34:20] somebody for being healed right but one
[1:34:23] thing we're thankful a real humble heart
[1:34:25] there's there's no unbelief that can
[1:34:28] keep God from a real sincere heart so
[1:34:31] let's just say if somebody has a
[1:34:32] distally spirit in here or somewhere
[1:34:34] else another church doesn't matter that
[1:34:36] doesn't means somebody can't get it you
[1:34:38] know it's just harder to get healed
[1:34:40] right it's just harder to do it cuz even
[1:34:43] jesus healed a crippled man at Simon
[1:34:46] Peters house right in those Pharisees
[1:34:49] he said what is it easier to do or
[1:34:51] what's up he's reduced easier to forgive
[1:34:52] his sins or heal his body so in that
[1:34:55] vein they have all those unbelief
[1:34:57] spirits right there and Jesus said rise
[1:34:59] take up your bed and walk
[1:35:00] is that right so see it can be done but
[1:35:03] it makes it harder the trouble with
[1:35:06] roots of unbelief or a sinner is that it
[1:35:08] spreads it's like leaven and spreads
[1:35:11] just like we so easily spread how do you
[1:35:14] want to spread the love of God instead
[1:35:15] of sin we ought to be able to spread the
[1:35:18] fruit of the Spirit the love of God we
[1:35:20] should be spreading those things rather
[1:35:22] than fruits of her crop ruin stay like
[1:35:25] that corrupt fruit and weeds and all
[1:35:28] these sins but that's one way someone
[1:35:31] can fail grace grace will not fail you
[1:35:33] if you accept grace but if you turn upon
[1:35:36] grace and crucify the word of God afresh
[1:35:39] to you we know what happens that's what
[1:35:43] the scripture says
[1:35:45] now a root of bitterness bitterness in
[1:35:47] this case means with extreme wickedness
[1:35:49] that was just bitter violent gall
[1:35:53] intense bitterness is also used as a
[1:35:55] poison of serpents let's the other way
[1:35:57] to look at it and that's what program
[1:35:58] said in the words of the church and
[1:36:00] Christ the mystery got revealed he said
[1:36:02] no men ever any any poisons of
[1:36:04] bitterness or poisons of greed of
[1:36:07] poisons of anything get in the church he
[1:36:09] said it'll hurt you he said it will kill
[1:36:11] the Spirit of God the church he said
[1:36:12] I'll hurt your pastor he said it'll do
[1:36:14] everything so instead remains on your
[1:36:17] best it defiles everybody at leavens the
[1:36:20] whole church but god help us to keep the
[1:36:22] feasts with sincerity and truth and keep
[1:36:25] all the sin out of the church my mom
[1:36:28] said that I know you feel the same way
[1:36:29] but we gotta come to this every time
[1:36:31] that we got to come to our lives and
[1:36:33] looking released having our lives
[1:36:34] do I have all the roots of bitterness
[1:36:36] out about the crown of my heart now this
[1:36:41] is alter description but let's go to
[1:36:42] Ephesians 3
[1:36:43] I'm sorry fusions 4:30 but this is from
[1:36:46] here but let's put feet 4:30 let's try
[1:36:47] to do a few more quotes I got 8 minutes
[1:36:50] of everything here that's just one hour
[1:36:53] beaches for 30 we compromise book this
[1:36:55] with our eyes closed and grieve not the
[1:36:57] Holy Spirit of God whereby the are
[1:37:00] sealed unto the
[1:37:01] your Redemption so this is where we can
[1:37:03] show people can be seen with the Holy
[1:37:04] Ghost but yet still have small falls in
[1:37:08] feathers now before we go on I'm gonna
[1:37:11] seal a desire to preach on this recently
[1:37:13] when brother Graham lied to the IRS
[1:37:14] don't remember that he said his head he
[1:37:17] felt like it was spinning it was going
[1:37:18] to blow up he said in one of the quotes
[1:37:20] he said I had a root of bitterness
[1:37:21] towards the IRS that was what was
[1:37:25] causing him to lie to his wife and the
[1:37:26] IRS a root of bitterness Manson I got
[1:37:29] the gold they drive out of my notes if
[1:37:30] you wanted if you wanted that that's
[1:37:32] what made him lie he was bitter towards
[1:37:34] the IRS and the investigation and even
[1:37:37] the IRS had said oh it's okay brother
[1:37:40] man the man said no it's not this is my
[1:37:43] response that you know I read the
[1:37:45] pokeman he said oh we put too much
[1:37:48] pressure on you said there's still no
[1:37:49] excuse for me to have a root of
[1:37:50] bitterness and that's how it is for
[1:37:52] every Christian in here there's no
[1:37:53] excuses that I harvest it right there's
[1:37:57] no reason to have boys in their lives
[1:37:59] let's have purity freeze gun crime
[1:38:02] Church beatings 431 let all bears so now
[1:38:05] the ball shows how the Holy Spirit is
[1:38:07] offended this is how always for is
[1:38:08] offended
[1:38:09] let all bitterness which we saw is
[1:38:10] poison we do this toward someone wrath
[1:38:13] which one problem rapid judgment on
[1:38:15] people and here I remember you can be
[1:38:17] angry too sitting up and yours but this
[1:38:19] is a bad anger where you what you want
[1:38:21] to do something about it clamor I didn't
[1:38:23] look at that up evil speaking be put
[1:38:27] away from you with all mouse mouse is it
[1:38:29] will like I'm going to do something
[1:38:30] people this person I'm gonna get them
[1:38:33] back that's Mouse I have an ill
[1:38:35] intention I didn't planning to hurt them
[1:38:37] sometimes you hurt people an accident
[1:38:39] don't mean it right but malice is when
[1:38:41] I'm trying to hurt this person because I
[1:38:43] feel they hurt me or because they hurt
[1:38:44] somebody else I love that's malice and
[1:38:47] these are the things that grieve or
[1:38:50] offend the Holy Spirit but look at verse
[1:38:52] 32 but be kind one to another
[1:38:55] tender-hearted forgiving one another
[1:38:59] even as God for Christ's sake hath
[1:39:02] forgiven you so in all things no matter
[1:39:06] how someone's hurt you or or whatever
[1:39:09] whoever's hurt you you have to look at
[1:39:11] every person as how would I treat them
[1:39:14] if Christ forgave how Christ forgive me
[1:39:17] how would Christ treat me that when I
[1:39:20] sit against Christ he would forgive you
[1:39:22] when you confess and Paul says it's that
[1:39:24] simple take any bitterness or any hurt
[1:39:27] towards any person and put yourself in
[1:39:29] Christ place what would Christ do if I
[1:39:32] get that to them and what we do you be
[1:39:34] tender-hearted grace God I mean no the
[1:39:37] Bible says that you've already obtained
[1:39:39] mercy
[1:39:39] if you've obtained mercy it's your
[1:39:42] possession how many know you should give
[1:39:43] it to other people
[1:39:44] let's go to first Peter two out I'll
[1:39:46] just read that because I just I've been
[1:39:48] reading through the book of first Peter
[1:39:49] after I got done with this EQ and first
[1:39:53] John second third job I'm reading first
[1:39:56] Peter now go to first Peter 2:9 if we
[1:40:09] have we actually have mercy as a
[1:40:10] possession we've actually much we can
[1:40:12] say we've arrived we can I say like that
[1:40:13] we don't want to think that like with
[1:40:15] like we've arrived and it's over there's
[1:40:17] no more of God but when it comes to
[1:40:20] actually I've arrived into God's mercy
[1:40:22] you have that you can say I am at God's
[1:40:27] mercy
[1:40:27] I've come to God's mercy I'll obtain
[1:40:30] this this is my property this is my
[1:40:32] possession I I have God's mercy aren't
[1:40:35] you glad you have God's an entertainment
[1:40:37] the Bible says in Psalms I believe is 92
[1:40:40] God is always ready to forgive and
[1:40:42] pardon so we've come that God's throne
[1:40:44] of mercy we've obtained this mercy and
[1:40:47] so we must extend to other people first
[1:40:51] Peter 2:9 we have our chosen generation
[1:40:52] a royal priesthood an holy nation a
[1:40:55] peculiar people that he should show
[1:40:56] forth the praises of him who hath called
[1:40:58] us out of darkness into his marvelous
[1:41:00] light how many how many called out of
[1:41:01] darkness
[1:41:01] I know out that darkness because I know
[1:41:04] what I used to be verse then which in
[1:41:06] times past were not a people but are now
[1:41:09] that people have got which have not
[1:41:11] which had not obtained mercy but now
[1:41:13] have obtained mercy grace gone it's just
[1:41:17] like this church just like your bother
[1:41:18] you pick your Bible say I've obtained
[1:41:20] the Bible you could say the same thing
[1:41:22] I've obtained the mercy of God God is
[1:41:25] going to have mercy on me why because I
[1:41:27] darkness and walking in the light I've
[1:41:30] reached you I have obtained it so we
[1:41:32] like you said never to say well I
[1:41:34] haven't know everything from the banker
[1:41:35] I got it all figured out Matt okay I
[1:41:36] deliver that's not the arrival that I'm
[1:41:38] talking about also the moist pressing on
[1:41:40] for more Bob for the longer the hall
[1:41:42] icon but we should be able to recognize
[1:41:44] that I have obtained mercy I have the
[1:41:46] mercy of God and I can plead the mercy
[1:41:48] of God for myself and for other people I
[1:41:51] go back to the FISA 3:16 Seasons 3:16
[1:42:03] says and he would grant you according to
[1:42:05] the riches of his glory to be
[1:42:06] strengthened with might by his spirit in
[1:42:08] the inner man that's the only way you're
[1:42:10] gonna get stronger is by accepting more
[1:42:12] of the Holy Spirit into your inner in
[1:42:13] their heart see the the light right in
[1:42:15] the roof since the inner man not the
[1:42:17] other man the inner man did you get the
[1:42:19] inner man right the outer man takes care
[1:42:21] of it right 17 that Christ may dwell in
[1:42:25] your hearts by faith that evening what
[1:42:28] are you church we are rooted and
[1:42:30] grounded in love this is what I'm gonna
[1:42:34] get to next services more brother maybe
[1:42:36] Wednesday so I'm spending more time as
[1:42:38] our heart as the ground but now Paul is
[1:42:41] making the statement that you are the
[1:42:42] plant and you were supposed to be
[1:42:44] grounded in Christ in love may be able
[1:42:47] to comprehend with All Saints what is
[1:42:49] the breadth and length and depth and
[1:42:50] height or look at that fourfold love
[1:42:52] next time we're sitting on that and to
[1:42:54] know the love of Christ which passes
[1:42:57] knowledge that you may be filled with
[1:43:00] all the fullness of God how many want to
[1:43:03] understand love I like to understand
[1:43:06] Paul said we can understand love and
[1:43:08] there's four parts do I want to preach
[1:43:09] on that next time at all times that
[1:43:10] today it's very simple but I think
[1:43:12] you'll you'll be blessed I know I was
[1:43:13] blessed by him to be blessed by two but
[1:43:16] see if you know the love of Christ then
[1:43:19] you can be filled with all the fullness
[1:43:20] of Christ praise God don't you love that
[1:43:23] nah that's beautiful now let me go
[1:43:29] through a few more quotes here now
[1:43:32] here's where brother Graham said any
[1:43:33] room any sin is a route here's where he
[1:43:35] says it this is in marriage Atlanta 62
[1:43:37] beautiful ending to this
[1:43:39] father they're yours he's praying at the
[1:43:41] altar they are trophies of your word
[1:43:43] they're here to be washed by the water
[1:43:44] of the word because it's the Full Gospel
[1:43:46] it's not sparing anything it's cut down
[1:43:49] to get down to the kindergarten place
[1:43:52] okay so they get down to very depths of
[1:43:54] things
[1:43:55] it's grubbing out the roots and the
[1:43:58] roots of bitterness and the roots of
[1:44:00] indifference the roots of the world grow
[1:44:03] them out Lord by the Holy Spirit cast
[1:44:05] them away from these people I claim them
[1:44:08] for you tonight Jesus as your own
[1:44:10] personal treasure as gems in your crown
[1:44:12] as members of your bride how many like
[1:44:15] that by God's grace like that and they
[1:44:16] go back to this I want to go back to
[1:44:20] that picture right here so program said
[1:44:23] the room of bitterness so bitterness can
[1:44:25] be a plant that grows down he said in
[1:44:28] different just being in different not
[1:44:30] winning agree with people were leanness
[1:44:32] any worldliness they're all they all can
[1:44:35] be roots in our lives
[1:44:36] I've never seen a root grow up in your
[1:44:38] life I have I'll be like a little raise
[1:44:40] my hand I'll be honest it I've seen
[1:44:43] things grow up a little fear a little
[1:44:46] bitterness a little greed little
[1:44:49] selfishness little things like that and
[1:44:51] program said may they be rooted out by
[1:44:53] the Holy Spirit
[1:44:54] he said go all the way down to the
[1:44:56] kindergarten level go all the way down
[1:44:58] to the life of that thing remember the
[1:45:02] story of the new Albanese Sunday school
[1:45:03] teacher brother am told we were part
[1:45:06] number as I started telling him she came
[1:45:08] to program many times saying tell me
[1:45:10] give me vision my friend gave me vision
[1:45:11] my man I gotta wait on the Lord for
[1:45:13] she'd spent all her husband's my girl
[1:45:16] doesn't work for Chevrolet I remember
[1:45:17] that girls work for Chevrolet
[1:45:20] she spent all his money at the doctor in
[1:45:23] cycling chiropractor was trying to get
[1:45:24] over her problems she came into program
[1:45:28] one time and finally the Holy Spirit
[1:45:30] shoulder with the problem was brother
[1:45:32] Graham saw a vision of her while she was
[1:45:34] married to her husband her husband was
[1:45:36] sent over to the war and she got lonely
[1:45:38] she went had an affair with another man
[1:45:39] almost got hit by a train in a car and
[1:45:42] he said I see you in a certain color car
[1:45:44] with a certain boy and she's straight
[1:45:46] after years of having psychiatrists and
[1:45:50] can't figure out what's wrong I wrote
[1:45:53] and said you better go confess that she
[1:45:55] said never she said I'll tell you you
[1:45:56] need to go or else we're gonna stay in
[1:45:58] this condition because he exposed the
[1:46:01] root of the problem the church said the
[1:46:05] root of the problem wasn't oh I need to
[1:46:06] go psychologists or I can't sleep her
[1:46:08] that's not the root the root of it was a
[1:46:10] sin that was unconfessed and it took the
[1:46:13] Word of God the Holy Spirit to go down
[1:46:15] to that kindergarten place that initial
[1:46:18] life an initial sin that was done and
[1:46:20] able to root it out and the only way to
[1:46:23] read out was to go confess it to her
[1:46:24] husband and we're going to be recursion
[1:46:27] so you can go because he said the same
[1:46:29] thing for you just a few nights ago he
[1:46:30] had a affair with a woman that works at
[1:46:32] the Chevrolet company and he said no not
[1:46:35] my husband and she said he said yes your
[1:46:37] husband go talk and they both confessed
[1:46:39] and they both asked for forgiveness and
[1:46:41] God restored their marriage what
[1:46:45] happened the Holy spirt went down to the
[1:46:47] root of it now these things I hear all I
[1:46:48] can't sleep or I need to go to a
[1:46:49] psychiatrist my stomach on the stomach
[1:46:51] ulcers all these things the very root of
[1:46:53] it was the unconfessed sin I mean want
[1:46:56] to confess all their sins amen
[1:46:58] and not let this grow up because if it's
[1:47:03] if the light keeps growing if that's
[1:47:05] keep saying that it's going to defile
[1:47:07] her sin to follow the whole church for
[1:47:09] Ramson it defied a pastor her husband
[1:47:12] her home life her kids were out of
[1:47:13] control this sin was the firing so many
[1:47:16] people but what what think about what
[1:47:18] rooted out from innocent he said the
[1:47:20] shovel of the Holy Spirit
[1:47:22] [Music]
[1:47:24] the tool of the Holy Spirit the Word of
[1:47:27] God are you able to go down there and
[1:47:28] say this is where you're wrong root it
[1:47:30] up and be freed Christ Nick I've come to
[1:47:35] my hour here let me find it basically
[1:47:36] closed program said this he says but
[1:47:42] when you live what you're talking about
[1:47:44] and show sweetness and all the roots of
[1:47:46] bitterness is out of you then then men
[1:47:48] will realize you've got something see
[1:47:52] the only way people are going to see
[1:47:53] anything in your life is when you have
[1:47:53] all the roots of bitterness up all the
[1:47:55] mouths all the clam and all the
[1:47:57] indifference any worldliness that's the
[1:47:59] only times people are going to
[1:48:00] well you have different planets in you
[1:48:01] than I have you have a you're guarded by
[1:48:05] your darkness is fruitful you don't have
[1:48:08] these things that I had that's the only
[1:48:10] way they're gonna know when all of the
[1:48:12] weeds around you love the Lord man look
[1:48:15] man upset with all the roots out he said
[1:48:19] a Christian can let the Holy Spirit grow
[1:48:21] and take out all the roots of bitterness
[1:48:23] and press God's way through him again he
[1:48:26] can come back in the same condition that
[1:48:28] it was in the Garden of Eden hey I'm
[1:48:31] gonna be amen when a person keeps their
[1:48:34] heart pure they come back to being a God
[1:48:36] amateur got on the earth just like Adam
[1:48:38] just at that point before sin to get no
[1:48:41] roots of bitterness get no roots of fear
[1:48:43] in the roots of greed or lust and he was
[1:48:46] a God on the earth
[1:48:47] he was constantly sneaking the word and
[1:48:49] the word manifested itself oh that's
[1:48:52] what we want don't we Church we want
[1:48:54] that he wasn't the word who want to
[1:48:55] speak the word and the word operates the
[1:48:57] only way to do that he's to confess
[1:48:59] anything in our hearts but in him said
[1:49:03] as he pressed himself forward in you
[1:49:05] don't let a root of bitterness hatred
[1:49:07] there's another root malice strike that
[1:49:10] will run him right back out again he
[1:49:15] says but every time you move a little
[1:49:16] move out a little unbelief God steps in
[1:49:19] and takes a little God takes a little
[1:49:21] more over of you so my bad leg goes down
[1:49:24] the similar feet but Ram says the Holy
[1:49:26] Spirit of use like a little white button
[1:49:28] right a light it's like a light the size
[1:49:30] of a little button as you keep on as you
[1:49:33] get all the sins out of the unbelief up
[1:49:35] that light begins to grow and pretty
[1:49:38] soon God's got more control of you than
[1:49:40] the devil has nice get rid of all the
[1:49:43] habits get rid of all these things get
[1:49:45] rid of all the thoughts and all the
[1:49:46] difference of a critical and everything
[1:49:49] like that
[1:49:49] hey get rid of all of that and then
[1:49:52] you're fully filled God moving and
[1:49:55] growing into your heart today man
[1:49:56] growing into your life the RAM said like
[1:50:00] that little button being the Holy Spirit
[1:50:02] when it came in the baptismal form then
[1:50:05] it just begins to spread out then when
[1:50:07] we got all roots of bitterness and evil
[1:50:09] away from us God just takes over and
[1:50:14] have another Lord today the Lord said
[1:50:18] you come here to the piano when you're
[1:50:20] ready sir
[1:50:23] but Graham said little isms little funny
[1:50:27] feelings around you brother and things
[1:50:29] like that shake it away don't let no
[1:50:31] root a bit of this ever get into your
[1:50:33] soul if you do you know canker you so
[1:50:35] instead of growing in Christ you'll
[1:50:37] wither in Christ he said right keep love
[1:50:41] I don't care how much people hate you
[1:50:43] you love them anyhow if you can't do
[1:50:45] that he said then you ain't sealed yes
[1:50:50] if we can't love those that hate us
[1:50:52] perhaps if we're probably not born again
[1:50:54] oh but love will keep out all
[1:50:57] bitterness all anger all strife all
[1:51:00] malice everything like that
[1:51:03] Oh Graham said Jesus had no bitterness
[1:51:08] when he was on the cross they mocked him
[1:51:10] spin his face he had no no roots of
[1:51:12] bitterness oh you could stand there and
[1:51:13] just take it like that when they spit
[1:51:17] his face and beat him around like that
[1:51:19] there was no root of bitterness he
[1:51:21] looked down at them and said Father
[1:51:22] forgive them for they don't know what
[1:51:24] they were doing the RAM said they all
[1:51:27] the roots of malice and all bitterness
[1:51:29] be taken from our lives then we might be
[1:51:31] humble and sweet before you praise God
[1:51:35] that's just enough some spirit living
[1:51:37] God

[1:53:56] said we're all sealed but yet we can
[1:53:59] grieve the influence of that sewer
[1:54:04] forgive us less them for their honesty
[1:54:10] when I'm praying for them right now in
[1:54:13] Jesus Christ's name
[1:54:14] may the love of God come to them right
[1:54:17] where they're standing as your prophet
