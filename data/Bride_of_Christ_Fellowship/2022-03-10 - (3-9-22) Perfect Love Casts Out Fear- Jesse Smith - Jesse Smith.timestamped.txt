[2:56] amen god bless you as being seated
[2:57] praise god
[3:04] perfect love
[3:05] casts out all fear
[3:07] what a promise
[3:09] i want to just uh
[3:14] meditate on this scripture again just
[3:15] for a minute you can switch over hon uh
[3:20] and i was now i thought of a new
[3:21] scripture i want to uh look to you real
[3:23] quick here
[3:25] just came to my mind okay
[3:27] so here's our text here tonight uh i'm
[3:30] pulling as i was thinking about this
[3:33] little study i got from work i started
[3:34] pulling i'm gonna post from a few
[3:36] sermons i've preached in the past and
[3:37] kind of put them together
[3:38] and combine them with this thought here
[3:42] i think it'd be a help to you i think
[3:43] it'd be a blessing i was kind of blown
[3:44] away
[3:45] uh when i was we had a little uh
[3:47] professional development on monday we
[3:48] didn't have kids so we went to
[3:50] uh went to some meetings with all the
[3:51] teachers and
[3:52] they put this paper in my front of my
[3:54] face and i'm like oh my goodness
[3:56] uh so we'll get to this in a little bit
[3:57] just something simple but
[3:59] just the the hour that we're living in
[4:01] is very complex it's a very challenging
[4:03] hour to live in
[4:05] but we know saints down through the ages
[4:06] have gone through
[4:08] uh
[4:08] major persecution right major trials and
[4:11] each time they overcome by the blood of
[4:13] jesus christ and by the word of their
[4:15] testimony
[4:16] praise god
[4:18] and so i just want to
[4:22] just pull this just simple thought out
[4:23] here about love
[4:25] the bible says love is made perfect
[4:29] so we have boldness in the day of
[4:31] judgment
[4:32] in other words as you as you mature as a
[4:34] christian you should grow in your
[4:36] confidence toward god
[4:38] and that god loves you so that on the
[4:41] day of judgment you're not worried if
[4:42] he's going to be displeased with me or
[4:44] if he's going to send me to hell or
[4:46] something like that you'll have boldness
[4:48] and you'll know that the love of god was
[4:50] perfected in your heart in other words
[4:52] god was able to teach you his love
[4:54] throughout your life praise god and you
[4:56] can look back after even last year or
[4:58] the year before and say my look what god
[5:00] has brought us through praise god
[5:02] tremendous temptations and and fears of
[5:05] 2020 right and fears of 2021 and here we
[5:08] are in 2022 you know fears that we never
[5:11] knew were even possible some of these
[5:13] pestilences and things
[5:15] you know but as we go along now look
[5:17] we're still standing
[5:20] many have fallen many have died because
[5:22] of the flu-like symptoms or the flu-lac
[5:24] symptoms of coven you know with
[5:25] pre-existing conditions many have died
[5:27] but it's about the same number as flu
[5:30] it's just an event it's just another
[5:31] form of the flu it kind of
[5:33] but you know we had to live through
[5:35] these fears and we can see now we're
[5:37] standing here we're stronger on this
[5:39] side we've got more confidence in god
[5:41] god's kept us amen god's never left us
[5:44] praise god he's never forsaken us
[5:46] hallelujah he's never uh never gotten
[5:49] rid of us praise god he's never cast us
[5:50] to the side we're still standing here
[5:53] declaring his name amen we're still
[5:55] blessing his name tonight amen where the
[5:58] devil would like to steal your praises
[5:59] or the devil would like to make you to
[6:01] discouragement or depression or or leave
[6:03] the church or something but here you
[6:04] stand as a child of god in the house of
[6:07] god giving praise to almighty god
[6:09] showing him that that you trust him no
[6:11] matter the situation amen hallelujah and
[6:14] you will trust him through anything that
[6:16] he and his wisdom allows to come to pass
[6:18] hallelujah because it's love love you
[6:22] learn to love more it's made perfect
[6:24] it's made complete
[6:26] so as a christian you grow in love for
[6:28] god and for others and remember that's
[6:30] the proof you are a christian jesus said
[6:32] if you love my disciples or if you love
[6:34] one another then you are my disciples
[6:35] indeed
[6:37] so see can't you see how we love each
[6:38] other you know we're trying to help one
[6:40] another out and be a blessing to one
[6:42] another we're growing in the love of god
[6:44] hallelujah
[6:46] and so that makes us bold that we know
[6:48] if we should die or if we should go to
[6:50] the grave it makes us bold to know that
[6:53] god's love has been perfected in me i've
[6:55] seen god's love grow in my life and i
[6:58] know that when when these eyes close for
[7:00] the final time there'll be angels there
[7:02] to pack me to my savior amen
[7:05] because to be absent from the body is to
[7:08] be present with the lord amen
[7:10] because as he is so are we
[7:13] in this world praise god in other words
[7:14] with the love of god amen as he has the
[7:17] love of god as he has as he is love of
[7:20] god here we are anointed with his spirit
[7:22] praise god and we stand the bible says
[7:25] as his representatives amen we're
[7:27] representatives of his love of his power
[7:29] amen of his grace of his mercy we
[7:32] represent him and we share the love of
[7:34] god with this world and then the bible
[7:36] says there's no fear
[7:38] in love
[7:40] but perfect love casts out fear so i
[7:44] want to just remind you church that that
[7:46] that fear is powerful
[7:48] satan there's the bible says there's a
[7:50] spirit of fear
[7:51] many will go to hell because of fear
[7:54] but we must remember there's one greater
[7:57] than fear that can cast fear out amen
[8:01] there's one that can just imagine
[8:02] there's one that can pick up fear you
[8:04] know if i was a strong man i'd pick this
[8:06] up and i could i could cast this out you
[8:08] know think about that i'm stronger than
[8:10] this or whatever it would be you're
[8:12] stronger the love of god in you is
[8:14] stronger than any fear devil can bring
[8:16] upon you amen
[8:18] it can cast out you can say you're not
[8:20] welcome here amen the love of god will
[8:22] say you're not welcome here you must
[8:24] leave here i'm throwing you out praise
[8:26] god
[8:27] it's got that authority the love of god
[8:29] has that power amen
[8:31] and it drives out it forces out fear it
[8:35] casts out fear because fear torments you
[8:39] and god the word says god does not want
[8:42] us tormented amen
[8:44] torment is is pain and suffering god
[8:47] wants us free from pain and suffering
[8:50] free from worry free from anxiety god
[8:52] wants us free in the name of jesus amen
[8:56] because anyone that lives in fear is not
[8:58] being complete in love
[9:00] right they're they're losing their faith
[9:02] they're losing uh they're trusting god
[9:04] they're losing their confidence in god
[9:06] but those who
[9:07] accept the love of god are made complete
[9:10] in god's love and then they show love to
[9:12] the world amen
[9:14] hallelujah why we love god because he
[9:16] first loved me
[9:18] hallelujah he knew where we'd be and
[9:20] i'll say like this he knew where to find
[9:21] you praise god
[9:23] he knew where to find you to show and
[9:25] prove his love to you praise god
[9:27] amen
[9:29] now i want to go back up here for a
[9:31] moment
[9:32] and look at a few scriptures it's been a
[9:33] few years since i preached this but
[9:35] let's look briefly at the uh
[9:37] the effects of fear remember i preached
[9:39] this in 2017 i thought my i was going
[9:40] through this today i thought i'd like to
[9:42] show this here real quick and then i
[9:43] want to get to this article
[9:46] church the effects of fear are
[9:47] disastrous to anyone
[9:50] fear will literally destroy a person
[9:54] spiritually and physically right now
[9:57] look at a few scriptures
[9:59] fear proves you don't believe
[10:02] okay that's what deuteronomy 1 32 says
[10:05] fear proves you don't believe but now
[10:07] let me balance this out here we'll get
[10:08] to that in just a moment uh
[10:10] second timothy i'm sorry second
[10:11] corinthians 7 5.
[10:15] i'm just gonna you know i'm gonna
[10:17] jump to that so you guys can see it
[10:18] i wanted to get this up there because i
[10:20] want to show the balance here as well by
[10:22] god's grace so let me look this up i
[10:23] want to present this for you second
[10:25] corinthians 7 5.
[10:29] there it is okay
[10:30] now i want you to see this here by god's
[10:32] grace
[10:34] and i'll try to magnify that like we did
[10:36] a few weeks ago
[10:39] appreciate everybody's patience with me
[10:44] there we go
[10:45] now this is written by the apostle paul
[10:47] and he said for when we were coming to
[10:49] macedonia our flesh had no rest but we
[10:51] were troubled on every side
[10:53] without we're fighting so that so paul's
[10:56] like in a war atmosphere right
[10:58] there's fightings outside and yet within
[11:00] there were what fears
[11:03] so here again we have this great
[11:05] illustration of how inside a believer
[11:07] you're battling fear you're battling sin
[11:09] and temptation and pride all these fears
[11:11] you're battling depression or or
[11:13] sickness all these things you're
[11:14] battling inside but yet at the same time
[11:16] you can be conquering amen
[11:19] because it's a battle there's a battle
[11:21] inside of you and so the holy spirit is
[11:23] calling us to fight the battle praise
[11:25] god
[11:26] just because we have fear doesn't mean
[11:27] we don't believe it just means we're in
[11:29] a battle to believe praise god
[11:32] it means that you're going to overcome
[11:34] but you've got to defeat the enemy
[11:36] standing before you praise god paul said
[11:38] there's fightings without i see men
[11:40] fighting and whether it's you know
[11:41] spiritual fightings in churches or or
[11:43] whether wars or people fighting with
[11:44] swords or he saw fightings outside but
[11:47] inside he saw fears cropping up i wonder
[11:50] what this one's going to say i wonder
[11:51] what that one's going to say i wonder
[11:52] what's going to happen next i wonder
[11:54] what's going to
[11:55] i wonder what next week holds i wonder
[11:57] next year holds see it was within but i
[11:59] love this nevertheless what does god do
[12:02] he gives you comfort when you're cast
[12:04] down amen in this case he sent a man
[12:06] named titus in other words that's just
[12:09] the man i needed to see and that man
[12:10] lifted me out of my fears hallelujah
[12:13] church called you the same thing for you
[12:15] tonight praise god maybe if you haven't
[12:17] yet but you're gonna probably shake
[12:18] somebody's hand tonight and it's gonna
[12:20] the love of god on them is gonna stir
[12:21] you up and raise you up out of any
[12:24] unbelief praise god
[12:26] amen
[12:27] hallelujah
[12:28] one man came to paul and paul said i'm
[12:31] comforted i'm not worried about the fear
[12:33] anymore i'm not worried about the fights
[12:35] i'm not worried about the troubles
[12:36] anymore because god sent a man to
[12:38] comfort me amen and if nobody else let
[12:40] me be the man to comfort you that jesus
[12:43] christ is the same yesterday today and
[12:45] forever amen
[12:46] he loves you he died for you he knew
[12:48] this hour would come praise god he knew
[12:50] everything about your life from
[12:52] beginning to end and he's here to
[12:53] comfort you he's here to bring you peace
[12:55] and refreshment amen
[12:57] but what does satan want to do he wants
[12:59] to torment us
[13:03] all the questions all the uncertainty
[13:06] all the fears he tries to bring them on
[13:08] us
[13:09] okay so i just want to share that there
[13:11] so you can see that we're all going to
[13:13] have fear
[13:15] but worshiping fear or being given over
[13:17] to fear proves a person doesn't believe
[13:21] remember this one fear keeps people out
[13:23] of their inheritance the ten spies came
[13:26] back and said there's no way we can go
[13:28] into the promised land the giants are
[13:30] way too big
[13:31] there's no way we can do what god said
[13:33] we could do now church that's what we
[13:34] got to tell the devil tonight tell the
[13:36] devil no i can do what god told me i can
[13:39] do
[13:40] if god gave me a promise if god gave me
[13:42] a spiritual blessing that spiritual
[13:44] blessing is mine because god said a-l-l
[13:47] spiritual blessings are mine amen
[13:50] now the time in season is the only thing
[13:52] that's in the question praise god
[13:54] is it the time and season for that
[13:56] but if you don't know seek god to know
[13:59] praise god but i can tell you if you're
[14:01] in a battle god wants you to win that
[14:02] battle god wants you to overcome that
[14:04] battle praise god god wants you to
[14:06] possess all these given to you
[14:08] amen
[14:10] now church fear is selfish
[14:13] let me go let's read that one judges 7
[14:15] 3.
[14:16] i don't quite remember that one i'd like
[14:17] to read that one
[14:18] some of these i remember
[14:20] joshua judges so sixth book of the bible
[14:26] oh that's right yeah i think this was uh
[14:28] gideon
[14:33] yeah now therefore go to proclaiming the
[14:35] ears of the people saying whosoever is
[14:36] fearful and afraid yeah let them return
[14:38] and depart early from mount gilead and
[14:41] their return to the people 20 and
[14:43] thousand and there remained ten thousand
[14:46] so gideon's army was at twenty two
[14:48] thousand but he said if anybody's afraid
[14:50] let him go home and now they went down
[14:51] they lost twelve thousand went down to
[14:53] ten thousand
[14:54] it was selfish what about israel why not
[14:57] fight for israel
[14:59] our countries uh we we've been slaves to
[15:01] these many nights
[15:02] they were selfish they thought about
[15:04] themselves more than uh the lies and
[15:06] their children and their women they
[15:08] thought about that more than they
[15:09] thought about the victory it was selfish
[15:12] praise god the church let's not let's
[15:14] not be like them let's be believers that
[15:17] stand there in the face of adversity and
[15:19] said i'm not leaving the battle praise
[15:21] god
[15:22] you can't talk me out of it you can't
[15:24] buy me out of it you can't beg me out of
[15:26] it i'm here to fight i'm here i'm a real
[15:28] believer praise god this is the hour
[15:30] victory praise god this is the hour of
[15:32] deliverance i'm on the lord's side amen
[15:35] hallelujah that's what i was born for
[15:38] amen i was born to be a christian i was
[15:40] born to overcome i was born to fight the
[15:42] lord's battles amen
[15:44] hallelujah
[15:46] i will not be selfish but i'll fight for
[15:48] the future of this church
[15:50] hallelujah
[15:51] i'll fight for the future of my family
[15:54] i'll fight for i'm not gonna back up and
[15:56] say it's impossible uh there's no way
[15:58] are the giant the obstacle's too hard no
[16:00] i'm gonna fight i'm gonna press through
[16:02] i'm gonna stay even if they the devil
[16:04] gives me open door i'm not gonna walk
[16:06] through the door to leave i'm gonna
[16:07] press on i'm gonna keep fighting because
[16:09] i'm one of god's
[16:11] amen
[16:13] see of course look satan's always gonna
[16:15] offer you here's the easy way out
[16:18] anybody want to go
[16:19] or just slip it right here tonight just
[16:21] slip away here tomorrow just go do this
[16:23] or that you can get rid of all this you
[16:24] can get rid of all your troubles you get
[16:26] rid of all this fear no sir
[16:28] in fact i'm gonna i'm gonna open the
[16:30] door jesus said i'm the door amen i'm
[16:32] gonna walk through the door that jesus
[16:34] opens praise god
[16:35] not the enemy i'm going to walk in faith
[16:37] into what god is doing in my life i see
[16:40] god raising up an army church do you see
[16:41] it praise god you see god raising up an
[16:44] army in akron ohio amen slowly but
[16:46] surely god is raising up an army amen
[16:50] we're the ones that got to fight we're
[16:51] the ones that got to overcome we're the
[16:53] ones that have to be concerned about
[16:55] others and not so much ourselves but be
[16:57] concerned and fight for others because
[16:59] this is the hour of victory hallelujah
[17:02] amen
[17:04] and then fear makes someone else useless
[17:06] in god's army
[17:08] see when we live by fear
[17:10] it makes us useless in other words fear
[17:12] is a paralyzing thing
[17:16] it makes you do nothing that's what i
[17:17] was trying to encourage our brothers uh
[17:19] last week or last sunday when i was
[17:20] preaching
[17:21] you're going to get criticized either
[17:23] way jesus never hid what he was
[17:25] preaching he preached it publicly he
[17:26] knew he was going to get criticized he
[17:28] knew he was going to be crucified but he
[17:30] knew to stand and declare the truth was
[17:32] the will of god for his life amen
[17:34] so he's willing to put up with the
[17:36] criticism he's willing to put up with
[17:37] all the adversity in order to please the
[17:40] father he said i always do that which
[17:42] pleases the father amen
[17:44] hallelujah
[17:46] how many want to be effective in the
[17:48] army of god
[17:50] you want to know your orders from you're
[17:51] the general jesus christ amen and you
[17:54] want to pack them out praise god
[17:56] but see we see them in that scripture
[17:58] selfish people become useless and leave
[18:01] the battle
[18:02] right
[18:04] and then
[18:05] fear brings on what we fear
[18:08] right we saw that with peter
[18:09] peter feared the waves so it brought on
[18:11] his sinking
[18:12] we saw with job job said i feared all
[18:14] this i fear losing my family i fear
[18:16] losing my money and that's what happened
[18:18] to him
[18:20] praise god now church any any person
[18:22] like you or i we we would have natural
[18:24] fears well what if this happens what if
[18:25] i lose my job what if i lose my house
[18:27] what if i lose my vehicle we have all
[18:29] these natural fears what if i get cancer
[18:31] all these natural things but we can
[18:33] either feed that fear or we can cast out
[18:35] that fear
[18:37] that's what we got to do praise god we
[18:38] got to trust in the lord amen we got to
[18:41] drive that out praise god we got to get
[18:42] our eyes off the situation and the bible
[18:44] says look up to heaven amen the bible
[18:47] says look unto the author and finisher
[18:49] of our faith amen
[18:52] hallelujah
[18:55] what we fear will come upon us
[18:58] but also what we believe will come upon
[19:00] us amen hallelujah
[19:03] if you believe god will give you the
[19:04] victory you'll get the victory praise
[19:06] god
[19:07] amen
[19:10] now fear allows sin to spread in the
[19:12] church
[19:13] that's titus 1 9. let's read that in
[19:16] first corinthians 5 6
[19:20] titus 1 9.
[19:25] right after the timothy books
[19:27] titus 1 9.
[19:36] verse 9 holding fast the faithful word
[19:39] as he hath been taught that he may be
[19:41] able by sound doctrine both to exhort
[19:43] and convince the gangsters
[19:48] huh that doesn't sound exactly right
[19:55] maybe it's two nine maybe i type that in
[19:57] there wrong
[19:59] no not two nine
[20:02] well i apologize for that i must have
[20:04] wrote the wrong scripture in there but i
[20:06] know first corinthians 5 6 for sure
[20:07] let's go to first corinthians 5 6 i
[20:09] don't know why i had that in there
[20:10] pardon me
[20:12] first corinthians 5 6.
[20:18] of course this was about the man who was
[20:20] a really immoral man he was a brother
[20:22] he'd been baptized but he was uh
[20:25] sleeping with his stepmother
[20:28] inside the church and the church was not
[20:30] mourning this
[20:31] they were not sorry about it there was a
[20:34] really wicked sin and a
[20:37] disease spiritual disease that entered
[20:39] the church verse six
[20:41] your glory is not good know ye not that
[20:43] a little leaven
[20:44] leaveneth the whole lump
[20:47] okay so in other words this shows any
[20:49] sin
[20:50] right that's allowed to be in the church
[20:52] it spreads like fire right it spreads
[20:54] right through amen
[20:57] so any sin will spread through so the
[21:00] opposite is true faith will spread like
[21:02] fire too amen because the holy ghost is
[21:05] fire amen
[21:07] holy fire amen
[21:08] faith spreads too
[21:10] so the holy spirit has to put out the
[21:12] unbelief amen
[21:14] and then that spreads and then we the
[21:15] bible says we'll encourage one another
[21:17] we uh the bible says we uh we go from
[21:20] faith to faith from glory to glory
[21:22] praise god the bible said every joint of
[21:24] the body supplies what the other joint
[21:25] needs amen in other words your the body
[21:28] of believers are going to pro supply
[21:29] what we have need of amen just like
[21:32] uh titus did to paul there titus did to
[21:34] paul
[21:36] now we've been over this one a lot but
[21:38] fear
[21:39] fed that little racism that peter
[21:41] battled there that was in galatians 2
[21:43] 12. let's read that
[21:47] see you'll see and you'll see then again
[21:48] or just revisiting that church problems
[21:51] many times start because of fear
[21:53] pride fear
[21:55] the bible says you can't have contention
[21:57] without pride
[22:00] so in this case peter was uh
[22:02] prideful that oh the jews are better
[22:03] than the gentiles so he wouldn't even
[22:05] eat with them
[22:06] galatians 2 12.
[22:09] but a part of this was fear verse 12 for
[22:12] before that certain came from james he
[22:14] did eat with the gentiles but when they
[22:15] were come
[22:17] he withdrew and separated himself what
[22:19] fearing them which were of the
[22:21] circumcision so fear
[22:24] this is the same man that had the keys
[22:25] to the kingdom but he let fear about
[22:27] what preachers would say about him keep
[22:30] him from honoring all the people in the
[22:32] church
[22:33] fear did that
[22:35] a man that saw jesus christ after now
[22:37] look at this church a man that saw jesus
[22:40] christ after he was resurrected you
[22:41] would think if i saw the living christ
[22:44] how could i ever battle again
[22:46] but it shows we're still living in this
[22:48] old past house amen we're still gonna
[22:50] have to battle you you can see how many
[22:52] visions did he see amen he saw a
[22:53] mountain transfiguration he saw these
[22:55] dead people raised he saw the woman
[22:57] raised the baby so the young girl raised
[22:59] from the jet darius jairus daughter he
[23:01] walked on water how many miracles do you
[23:02] think would be enough to overcome fear
[23:04] none because god wants you to overcome
[23:07] amen he's not going to give you a magic
[23:09] pill to make you overcome he wants you
[23:11] to choose and and fight and stand there
[23:14] and say i'm going to live for god i'm
[23:15] going to overcome this so see we can't
[23:17] live by experience so much we got to
[23:19] live by faith in the word amen
[23:23] even seeing jesus resurrected wasn't
[23:25] enough for him to not fear the preachers
[23:29] see because god's going to let you he's
[23:30] going to teach you he wants you to learn
[23:32] to love him and the church said
[23:34] he wants you to grow in perfect love to
[23:36] the to the lord
[23:38] hallelujah
[23:40] see fear
[23:42] fed that racism in that church
[23:45] and fear ultimately if it's surrendered
[23:48] to if it's worshiped if it's loved will
[23:50] destroy a soul
[23:52] revelation 21 8
[24:00] and notice it's the first one
[24:03] because fear and unbelief go together
[24:08] because that because israel feared the
[24:10] ten spies fear the giants they didn't
[24:11] believe
[24:13] so fear and unbelief go together verse
[24:15] eight but the fearful and unbelieving
[24:17] and the abominable and murderers and
[24:19] whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters
[24:20] and all liars shall have their part in
[24:22] the lake which burneth with fire and
[24:24] brimstone which is the second death
[24:26] think and you've heard this before but
[24:27] think of all the people that are now
[24:29] afraid to go to church because of fear
[24:30] of covet or omicron or whatever
[24:33] right they're probably going to release
[24:34] another one whatever i mean who knows
[24:36] right what are we going to do just live
[24:38] in fear
[24:39] no
[24:40] and if they've left the house of god and
[24:42] they they choose to live in fear rather
[24:44] than worshiping it's possible they can
[24:45] lose their faith
[24:48] the fearful and unbelieving will not
[24:50] inherit the kingdom of god
[24:52] amen so it's a good reminder for us all
[24:54] we all need to grow in love and whenever
[24:56] giant or whatever obstacles before us
[24:58] let's take it down let's cast it down
[25:00] let's overcome amen
[25:03] hallelujah
[25:06] now i'm not going to go here so now i'm
[25:07] going to read this article okay so i
[25:08] know you've been waiting this whole time
[25:09] for the article so
[25:11] uh just a
[25:12] a nice little article here
[25:16] i'll get to this just a moment okay so
[25:18] they laid this down in front of me and
[25:19] i'm like oh my goodness i gotta preach
[25:20] this
[25:21] believe it or not it's from 2017.
[25:24] this is five years ago
[25:26] this is called the five brain disorders
[25:29] that were born out of the digital age
[25:32] this was five years ago
[25:34] in other words there's five
[25:36] spiritual disorders
[25:38] that have come upon people just because
[25:40] of all the screens
[25:43] okay
[25:46] now there's just five i'm just going to
[25:47] go through them briefly the first one is
[25:49] called nomophobia and you can look it up
[25:51] in the dictionary we did we looked up in
[25:52] the dictionary on monday at work
[25:54] nomophobia and this means this is this
[25:57] is shortened for no mobile phobia
[26:00] or i don't have my cell phone fear
[26:03] or i don't have internet fear
[26:05] i've never left their cell phone
[26:07] somewhere
[26:08] they're like my whole life is over
[26:11] or you're in remember the power went out
[26:13] last year at our house what am i gonna
[26:15] do without the internet
[26:18] this is the actual fear
[26:21] it's been uh demonstrated in these
[26:23] studies
[26:26] it's a feeling of panic
[26:28] upon being separated from your phone or
[26:30] tablet
[26:32] 70 73 percent of
[26:35] englanders
[26:37] felt panic when they misplaced their
[26:39] phone
[26:40] another 14 spiraled into pure
[26:43] desperation
[26:44] and this was back in 2012 church
[26:48] this is 10 years ago now
[26:50] people in the uk which we know there's
[26:51] not many believers in the uk right
[26:54] so how do you feel when you don't have
[26:55] your phone you let that spirit of fear
[26:57] come over you oh oh my all my
[26:59] information my whole life all my
[27:01] pictures on there my kids all my
[27:02] pictures out there
[27:04] it's a real thing
[27:07] they've studied it
[27:12] now they say
[27:13] at this point it's
[27:14] it's hard to tell whether this is good
[27:16] or bad for our long-term health well i
[27:17] got news for you it's bad for your
[27:18] long-term health
[27:20] i don't have to be a studier i don't
[27:21] have to be a doctor to know that
[27:24] anytime you're afraid that your life's
[27:26] gonna end you go into a panic just
[27:27] because you lost one man-made device
[27:30] you've got problems
[27:32] and your problems are bigger than a
[27:33] missing a phone your problems are
[27:34] spiritual problems
[27:37] you're trusting in a device your hope
[27:39] and your joy all your love and all your
[27:41] love is in all those things just think
[27:43] about this church what if people their
[27:45] house burnt down
[27:46] and they lost all their pictures they
[27:48] lost i mean could you even go on without
[27:50] that of course you can go on without
[27:51] that
[27:53] but some some people play so much on i
[27:55] mean i know there's family memorabilia
[27:57] or whatever they call it i know those
[27:59] things can be important but in all
[28:00] reality you're still alive
[28:03] you still have life yourself a chance to
[28:04] start over and make new memories amen
[28:08] you still got hope that if your loved
[28:09] ones have passed on although you lost
[28:11] their picture if they're so saved you'll
[28:12] hug their neck one more time you'll hug
[28:14] their neck on the other side amen
[28:18] so what big deal is that if you lose
[28:19] your phone or lose your tablet
[28:22] it's a spirit that gets on people a
[28:25] spirit of fear
[28:31] now it's been a while since i lost my
[28:32] phone so i'm not condemning anybody
[28:34] uh brother austin we went through that
[28:36] on my brother austin misplaced his phone
[28:37] on monday and i'm not preaching on him
[28:39] i'm the this is what i got on monday so
[28:40] i was gonna preach to everybody i've
[28:42] lost my phone though before i lose my
[28:44] keys so much i got to put one of those
[28:45] reminders on there to help me find it
[28:47] where's that where's that i got to find
[28:49] that
[28:50] i just misplace it sometimes
[28:52] but it's the fear that comes upon us
[28:54] that we got to overcome
[28:56] these are all new uh disorders
[29:00] or spiritual conditions that come upon
[29:02] people because they don't have faith in
[29:03] the word of god
[29:06] so nomophobia
[29:09] no more phone phobia
[29:11] my whole life i don't have my phone
[29:14] and they panic
[29:16] now we laugh but for some people it's a
[29:17] reality
[29:20] because they worship that phone they
[29:21] worship their tablet they worship that
[29:24] they got to have that in their hands
[29:25] more than their hands prayed up to god
[29:26] in the bible praise god
[29:28] put more confidence in a phone than the
[29:30] living god amen
[29:32] that phone can fail you that phone can
[29:34] break and fall but god's word can never
[29:36] break amen god's word can never fall to
[29:38] the ground heaven earth shall pass away
[29:40] cell phones will pass away cell phone
[29:42] towers will fall but god's word will
[29:44] never pass away
[29:46] amen
[29:48] number two is
[29:50] technofurance techno friends
[29:55] in 2014
[29:58] over 50 percent of the people studied
[30:03] said that their phones interrupted their
[30:05] leisure time their conversations and
[30:07] their meals with significant others
[30:12] and this led to the name technofurance
[30:14] so in other words interference from
[30:16] technology
[30:19] now all these alerts on our phone
[30:22] are correlated with lower relationship
[30:24] and life satisfaction discontentment
[30:29] all these notifications
[30:32] interrupting our time with our loved
[30:34] ones
[30:35] interrupting church that's why we should
[30:36] turn off our phones during church i got
[30:38] to keep mine on in case i get a text or
[30:39] sometimes i use it to put up here but
[30:41] you don't see me texting like hey
[30:43] take a selfie of me
[30:45] look i'm in the house of god guys just
[30:47] ridiculous ridiculous
[30:50] i mean some people do that but that's
[30:51] ridiculous
[30:55] but it the the cell phone interrupts our
[30:57] family time and it ruins our family time
[30:59] and ruins some of our relationships
[31:04] a disorder and the church said
[31:07] it's a disorder
[31:09] and it was in 2014 so that was eight
[31:11] years ago
[31:12] what is it now
[31:14] it's even worse
[31:19] their relationships suffer
[31:21] because of frequent interruptions
[31:24] that's why when my wife and i go on our
[31:25] day i try to put my phone down
[31:28] face down and i have the notifications
[31:30] off
[31:31] and that's why i'll just make up i'll be
[31:32] proactive i'll send malachi text or
[31:34] lydia how's it going and i just set it
[31:36] down
[31:36] you know because i can sit there and
[31:37] worry the whole two hours like oh is my
[31:39] children okay i could be so worried
[31:43] in other words be enslaved to fear
[31:46] and then if if i constantly look at
[31:48] those i got an email i got an important
[31:49] question i mean you got to shut off at
[31:50] some time church
[31:52] you can't be a slave to that thing you
[31:53] got to shut it off at some time and the
[31:54] church said
[31:57] if you die those those red circles are
[31:59] going to keep coming up praise god
[32:00] they're they're never going to quit
[32:01] they're going to get spam texts and spam
[32:03] emails all these things you cannot live
[32:05] by that you must live by faith you must
[32:08] live by the holy spirit you must trust
[32:10] god and love god amen
[32:13] and don't let a phone or tablet ruin
[32:15] your relationships
[32:17] and get a disorder
[32:19] and be dissatisfied with life
[32:22] because you don't you need quiet time to
[32:24] make connections with people
[32:27] praise god
[32:29] that's the second disorder nomophobia
[32:31] technoference
[32:35] the third one this is kind of funny
[32:38] it's called the phantom ring
[32:42] so when they study people the phantom
[32:44] ring
[32:45] uh two-thirds of people
[32:48] wherever they kept their phone
[32:50] they'll just feel like it's buzzing
[32:53] and they'll go to check it and it didn't
[32:55] have a buzz
[32:57] it's a phantom ring and it causes stress
[33:01] constantly all the time and they live
[33:03] under pressure so that buzzing or
[33:05] ringing or whatever your favorite
[33:06] ringtone is
[33:08] instead of a help it becomes a hurt
[33:12] instead of a blessing it becomes a curse
[33:14] because now and i've done that before
[33:16] too i felt like my phone's going off i
[33:17] felt like my legs vibrating so i'll go
[33:19] and check it
[33:21] i feel kind of ashamed of myself
[33:24] now not lately
[33:26] but this is actually a disorder
[33:28] the study says people will be sitting
[33:29] there
[33:30] and they'll interrupt them and they'll
[33:31] go to check and there's nothing there
[33:34] so all they can figure out is that uh
[33:36] that any little movement of the clothes
[33:38] now
[33:39] sends a message to the skin and and
[33:41] makes you think that any little movement
[33:43] any little rubbing now imitates that and
[33:45] makes you makes you react to it
[33:47] but actually it's a spirit
[33:49] of stress and anxiety
[33:52] oh i'm feeling oh somebody's calling me
[33:54] somebody's calling me
[33:57] in other words like all this pressure's
[33:59] on me all this pressure i got to get
[34:00] back to these people i gotta get back to
[34:02] people now church let me tell you and
[34:04] naomi knows this and my wife if you
[34:06] don't get back to me no problem at all
[34:10] all you need is a cell phone for maybe
[34:12] five minutes
[34:13] and start texting people and you're
[34:14] gonna learn people aren't gonna get back
[34:16] to you when you wanna get back to them
[34:17] or when you want them to get back to you
[34:19] just be happy you got friends praise god
[34:25] there's so much pressure we put on
[34:27] ourselves and it becomes anxiety
[34:30] like like naomi will sometimes apologize
[34:32] if she didn't if she waits a day to text
[34:34] me back i mean sister there's no reason
[34:35] to apologize i know you're you're just
[34:37] so kind and loving you don't have to
[34:38] apologize for that sometimes i don't
[34:39] text people back for weeks
[34:41] i'm like oh yeah i'm sorry brother
[34:44] yes
[34:46] right yeah raising a family you know
[34:47] feeding family
[34:49] and we you know
[34:51] but this is a disorder people have
[34:54] right
[34:56] oh all the time gotta have it see church
[34:58] i'd say like this if we would worship
[35:00] god love god more we'd feel the holy
[35:02] spirit on us amen amen it wouldn't be a
[35:04] phantom ring but we feel the presence of
[35:06] god amen we start crying or shouting or
[35:08] raising our hands or we feel his
[35:10] presence that's what we want to feel the
[35:11] prince of god not the presence of a cell
[35:13] phone the prince of the holy one praise
[35:15] god
[35:16] amen
[35:17] that's what we need to feel hallelujah
[35:21] now here's one that kind of goes with it
[35:22] number number four
[35:24] cyber
[35:26] chondria
[35:28] cyberchondria you've probably heard of
[35:30] hypochondria
[35:32] right hypochondra is people who diagnose
[35:35] their own illnesses i'm sorry uh
[35:38] yeah cyberchondra is people who diagnose
[35:40] their own illnesses online
[35:45] one in three americans back in 2017 say
[35:48] they've used the internet to
[35:49] self-diagnose
[35:52] they say for people who already battle
[35:54] hypochondria this can be detrimental
[35:57] they get neurotic they go down a google
[35:59] wormhole
[36:00] frantically reading about every dreaded
[36:02] disease that matches their symptoms
[36:05] and the church said
[36:08] a certain for example a search for
[36:10] abdominal pain brings up diagnosis that
[36:12] include everything from food poisoning
[36:14] to stomach cancer and soon the googler
[36:16] is
[36:17] convinced they're dying
[36:23] this is a real
[36:24] disease it's a mental spiritual it's a
[36:28] it's anointing of fear
[36:30] see the devil whispers oh see ah it's
[36:32] more than just a stomach ache you got
[36:35] cancer
[36:38] always assume the worst no it's okay
[36:40] that's what the devil does right we
[36:42] laugh at it because we've experienced
[36:43] that i mean we've all had those i've had
[36:44] those questions too
[36:46] i'm not sleeping i've had a headache for
[36:47] two weeks i wonder if i got cancer
[36:50] i got the problem of not sleeping enough
[36:52] that's my problem
[36:53] i need to sleep in that's or go to bed
[36:55] earlier that's the problem and every
[36:56] time i sleep in i feel better
[36:59] now before i think it was actually
[37:00] drinking too much coffee that's what i
[37:01] think it was before yeah my wife says
[37:02] amen
[37:04] but see i could have went down and said
[37:05] oh i must have a brain tumor i have i've
[37:07] had a headache for two weeks oh here i
[37:09] am five years later i'm fine i'm healthy
[37:11] i got all kinds of energy praise god
[37:15] but we could follow the fear of the
[37:17] devil and he could talk us into having
[37:19] something
[37:21] cybercon cyberchondria
[37:26] this is a huge problem because online
[37:28] symptom checkers
[37:31] are wrought with inconsistencies and
[37:33] inaccuracies online not everything's
[37:35] true online does everybody know that
[37:39] more than half the time the top
[37:40] diagnosis is matching the symptoms
[37:42] search will be wrong one study found
[37:44] that's just one study
[37:46] half of the searches are totally wrong
[37:48] to begin with
[37:49] they give you the wrong answers
[37:51] it doesn't match your situation
[37:56] now they say for a number of reasons
[37:58] doctors aren't too happy about
[37:59] self-diagnosis trend they say
[38:03] they say it's a loss of their control
[38:05] but also it undermines their authority
[38:08] they say
[38:10] but the main problem they say is it
[38:11] messes with a diagnostic process because
[38:14] the results can suggest rare or morbid
[38:16] conditions to patients which in turn can
[38:18] prompt the appearance of new symptoms
[38:21] in other words when they start reading
[38:22] this other ones oh i didn't know now i
[38:24] got this too
[38:26] well i had cancer but now i also got
[38:27] tuberculosis and i also got
[38:30] emphysema i mean
[38:32] all these things yes sister um
[38:36] when i was pregnant i was looking at
[38:38] stuff yeah a lot and in the beginning
[38:40] and it made me so worried i started
[38:42] crying and then remember i told you i
[38:44] gave it to god yeah i stopped and i
[38:46] stopped running to the hospital every
[38:48] time i didn't feel removed and so i just
[38:50] kind of
[38:51] put my trust in god because i was
[38:52] looking up so freaking out calling
[38:54] doctor
[38:55] amen let's thank the lord for that
[38:56] praise god gave me the victory amen
[39:00] amen
[39:02] that's what that's what we got see god
[39:03] brings us that point we've all done that
[39:05] sister to some degree or another right
[39:06] we've all gone online or or searched out
[39:08] something i must have this i must have
[39:09] that and must have that
[39:11] but then we get to the spot we have a
[39:12] choice are we either going to accept
[39:13] fear or accept faith and faith accepted
[39:15] faith amen i didn't know you praise god
[39:18] faith accepted faith and we can all come
[39:19] to that point praise god
[39:24] so see then satan likes to give you oh
[39:25] you actually have this too you didn't
[39:27] know this but you also have this too
[39:29] you also have this infection you have
[39:31] this problem you have all these things
[39:34] you know what we ought to tell satan we
[39:35] ought to get out god's book
[39:37] we'll say i'm going to search god's book
[39:39] and i'm going to go to psalm 103 i am
[39:41] the lord thy god that heals all thy
[39:43] diseases
[39:45] you're telling me all these symptoms but
[39:46] my book
[39:47] the real doctor he told me god heals all
[39:50] my diseases amen
[39:52] he told me to cast out anything that
[39:54] exalts itself against the word of god
[39:56] amen
[39:57] cast out all symptoms amen
[40:00] and take care of them if you can take
[40:01] care of them do your part take care of
[40:02] them like that brother from uh iowa i
[40:04] think i told you this brother austin his
[40:06] name was rich and he actually came back
[40:07] to the church he left the church but he
[40:08] came back god gave him a great victory
[40:11] he was drinking so much diet coke i
[40:12] think i told you this he couldn't walk
[40:14] up the stairs to work
[40:16] and he would go up for prayer and
[40:17] nothing would happen
[40:19] well one day a friend of his on the job
[40:20] wasn't even a christian said you're
[40:22] probably drinking too much diet coke
[40:24] well he stopped drinking diet coke
[40:25] within a week he was able to walk the
[40:27] stairs he's fine now
[40:29] he just don't drink diet coke
[40:31] but he could have said oh i've got
[40:32] arthritis
[40:34] oh and then the devil said oh now i got
[40:36] cancer i'm dying i got muscular
[40:38] dystrophy i mean all these things
[40:40] alzheimer's got all of them could have
[40:42] came in there and the whole time it was
[40:44] just lack of tempers amen
[40:47] a lack of self-control to not be
[40:49] addicted to man-made sugars and all
[40:51] these things see instead of worrying we
[40:54] should take it to the lord and ask god
[40:55] god help me lord you show me now there's
[40:57] times we go to the doctor but there's
[40:59] other times we can't get there let's go
[41:00] to the mighty doctor amen the eternal
[41:02] doctor the holy doctor amen
[41:05] dr jesus
[41:08] glory
[41:10] see all these fears and there's one more
[41:17] there's one more
[41:19] i think maybe the one that maybe fight
[41:21] would fight me the most is the no mobile
[41:22] phobia you know like i'm just if i'm not
[41:24] connected i'm going to miss out on
[41:25] something but i'm growing in that i'm
[41:27] growing that
[41:28] i'm grown
[41:29] it's never been a big problem it's never
[41:31] been disordered but that would be the
[41:32] one that i think affects me the most
[41:34] when i'm sick i don't go to the internet
[41:35] i go to my wife honey can you get me
[41:37] some garlic or something like that
[41:39] what do you what do you what can you do
[41:40] for me
[41:42] bless her soul amen
[41:44] best or so when but when the god gives
[41:46] you wife the bible says you get favor
[41:48] from the lord
[41:49] god gave me favor but he gave me my life
[41:51] amen i got great favor amen
[41:55] fifth and final one is the truman show
[41:57] delusion
[41:58] so i actually saw this movie before i
[41:59] was a christian in 1998 do you remember
[42:01] the truman show jim carrey realized he
[42:04] was being watched by all the like but by
[42:06] big brother and he realized his whole
[42:07] life was a tv set
[42:10] he was being watched by the government
[42:13] um now this though it's a false
[42:16] perception that your life is being
[42:18] broadcast to everyone
[42:21] this this is a disorder it's not a new
[42:24] diagnosis but it's a fresh twist on
[42:27] on uh
[42:28] on uh grand it's called a grandiose
[42:30] illusion
[42:33] okay and today it's a product and the
[42:34] digital age is a product of overly
[42:36] connected being overly connected to
[42:38] people
[42:40] right
[42:41] it's through reality tv based obsessions
[42:44] social media driven lifestyles
[42:46] and narcissistic qualities so
[42:48] self-worship
[42:51] right so the more people are tuned into
[42:53] their phones the more social media the
[42:55] more they're connected to people they're
[42:56] actually over see and that's where
[42:58] problems always happen on social media
[42:59] on phones people overstep their
[43:01] boundaries because because they let
[43:03] other people into their lives too much
[43:05] like they complain about their husband
[43:06] complain about their wife complain about
[43:08] their kids they're letting too much
[43:09] people in
[43:10] the bible says hide people's faults amen
[43:13] don't post it online hide that praise
[43:15] god
[43:16] pray for them amen
[43:18] but see because of this people get too
[43:20] connected and people start giving you
[43:22] advice or something like that but i mean
[43:24] that's fine but you shouldn't put it out
[43:25] on public and the real vice should come
[43:27] from the bible praise god
[43:29] amen
[43:34] what is today's fuel now this is
[43:36] interesting too i didn't know this but
[43:37] this is a
[43:38] education document written by a phd in
[43:41] the 1940s the japanese controlled
[43:43] american minds with radio waves i didn't
[43:45] know that
[43:46] in the 1950s soviets accomplished this
[43:49] with satellites they were controlling
[43:50] the people's minds through satellites
[43:52] in the 1970s the cim planted computer
[43:55] chips into people's brains to run tests
[43:57] to control them
[43:59] what's today's delusion fuel
[44:01] take your pick of the kardashian sisters
[44:04] and then compound it with a dose of the
[44:05] latest
[44:06] nsa revelations
[44:08] and all the reality shows
[44:10] the resulting delusions aren't real but
[44:12] they're they certainly aren't random
[44:15] see because it says you live off a uh
[44:17] you
[44:18] live off a snippet of the kardashians
[44:20] live off a snippet of the nightly news a
[44:23] snippet off of this and you get a false
[44:24] sense of reality
[44:28] so you have this false perception that
[44:30] your life everyone's caring about your
[44:31] life everyone's looking at your life
[44:33] everybody's watching you
[44:36] and that takes away your joy
[44:39] that takes away your peace because you
[44:41] know everyone i got to make sure i look
[44:43] good
[44:44] my whole life what are people going to
[44:45] think
[44:48] it doesn't matter what people think it
[44:49] matters what god thinks
[44:51] praise god
[44:53] five disorders i thought it was
[44:54] interesting some of them were related to
[44:55] fear
[45:00] and i thought my if that if this was
[45:01] 2017 if there was five in 2017 where are
[45:04] we at today
[45:05] there's probably 15 or 20 disorders
[45:07] all because of people
[45:09] feeding on the phone more than they're
[45:10] feeding on the word of god
[45:13] amen let me try to bring this down here
[45:18] now i'm going to skip past this here
[45:23] so our earthly work abounds when we have
[45:25] no fear of death
[45:27] in other words you'll be the the best
[45:28] servant of christ when you don't fear
[45:30] dying because paul said o death where's
[45:33] your sting
[45:34] oh grave where's your victory what is
[45:36] death it's just an open door to the
[45:38] prince of god
[45:40] amen
[45:42] like that song says if you get there
[45:43] before i do
[45:45] coming forward to carry me home amen
[45:46] tell them i'm coming home soon amen
[45:48] hallelujah praise god amen
[45:51] this thing of death is sin the strength
[45:52] of sin is the law but thanks be to god
[45:55] which gives us the victory through our
[45:56] lord jesus christ
[45:59] therefore because because you're not
[46:01] afraid of death anymore brethren be
[46:04] steadfast
[46:06] in other words keep moving put keep
[46:07] putting the same effort into the gospel
[46:09] you've always put into it
[46:11] be unmovable don't let anybody shake or
[46:13] move you off your face
[46:16] and always abound that means increase in
[46:18] the wheat in the work of the lord
[46:20] so for me that's more preaching for me
[46:22] that's more studying that's more song
[46:24] leading although it's awful sometimes
[46:26] forgive me
[46:27] uh for me that's more youtube videos
[46:29] more podcasts it's more time in the word
[46:31] of god amen
[46:33] hallelujah and for you it's you
[46:35] abounding in your ministries god has
[46:37] given you give yourself more don't fear
[46:39] death
[46:40] hallelujah just abound more pour
[46:42] yourself more into the work of god
[46:44] because you know jesus says conquer
[46:46] death amen
[46:47] and brethren said death was the greatest
[46:49] fear that christians had or believers
[46:52] had but jesus took away that fear
[46:54] because he said i have the keys of death
[46:56] amen
[46:58] hallelujah jesus controls death
[46:59] hallelujah in other words jesus knows
[47:02] when you're going to go and you can if
[47:04] you can trust anybody with death you can
[47:06] trust jesus christ hallelujah
[47:08] amen
[47:11] what hosea said i will ransom them i'll
[47:14] buy them back from the power of the
[47:15] grave
[47:16] i will redeem them from death
[47:19] o death
[47:20] i will be your plague amen jesus is
[47:24] going to destroy death amen
[47:26] see we get all afraid of what that's
[47:28] going to do to us don't fear death jesus
[47:30] is going to take care of death amen
[47:32] oh grave jesus will be your destruction
[47:35] amen
[47:36] hallelujah
[47:38] repentance shall be hid from mine eyes
[47:41] now we're not going to read this tonight
[47:43] but remember i want to preach on david
[47:44] church david overcame all this fear of a
[47:47] 10-foot man the closest we have is
[47:49] austin are you 6-3 austin or
[47:51] six three he's the closer we have the
[47:53] ten foot man
[47:54] right that's gotta be what nine or maybe
[47:56] nine and a half
[47:58] okay remember can't preach on david guys
[48:00] remember that everybody remember
[48:01] benjamin set up there on the bench
[48:03] remember that
[48:05] and one of you standing before a 10-foot

[48:10] wants to kill you you know he wants to
[48:11] battle you know he's got a big sword his
[48:13] sword's probably bigger than you
[48:16] but how did david overcome fear he had
[48:18] revelation in other words god showed him
[48:20] he was going to win the battle
[48:22] god showed him what to do
[48:25] in church that's what we got to wait for
[48:26] we got to pray until god shows us what
[48:28] to do
[48:30] like brother also i'm going to tell this
[48:31] testimony real quick austin had a uh
[48:33] migraine all day sunday right
[48:37] i didn't know it
[48:38] but after service i got there and he had
[48:40] his head down at the table he said man i

[48:52] going to work i just kind of wait on the
[48:53] lord
[48:56] all of a sudden jose said i'm going to

[49:00] giving testimonies about people being
[49:01] healed i said wait brother jose i said
[49:03] wait can you lay hands on austin can you
[49:04] pray for him
[49:08] brother jose laid his hands on him he

[49:13] he had the headache migraine all
[49:15] tomorrow morning right

[49:19] something
[49:20] we laid hands he said a real prayer he
[49:21] rebuked satan
[49:23] i didn't hear you praise god
[49:25] amen
[49:29] he says he said you're healed the name
[49:30] of jesus he leaves i started massaging
[49:32] his back and i started giving awesome
[49:34] good massage there i get a lot of good
[49:35] practice you know at home
[49:39] i start massaging his head and brother
[49:41] what was it within 10 minutes
[49:43] it was totally gone he had it all day
[49:47] but i had to wait i had to wait for a
[49:48] revelation in other words like how do we
[49:50] do this
[49:51] and in church i just felt like it just
[49:53] come down from heaven have jose pray i
[49:55] say jose let's pray
[49:57] that's how it was i was just standing
[49:58] there i was going i knew what we wanted
[49:59] to pray for every single god i'm not
[50:00] sure how that's going to happen and all
[50:02] of a sudden the inspiration struck get
[50:03] jose
[50:05] hallelujah and he has the rest of the
[50:06] day no more migraines and the church
[50:08] said
[50:09] amen i thank the lord amen a revelation
[50:12] in other words this is how it's going to
[50:14] be done
[50:16] in other words god show david go get the
[50:18] five stones you're going to use your
[50:19] sling
[50:20] and defy him in the name of the lord
[50:23] and you're going to take him down with
[50:24] that sling he knew it he saw it
[50:28] he had to ignore all his family and
[50:30] church critics
[50:33] his brothers tried to stop him the
[50:35] soldiers tried to stop him
[50:38] he had to go overcome fear he had to
[50:40] even go past what his brother said about
[50:42] it
[50:44] and he had to recall god already gave me
[50:46] victory
[50:48] i already defeated a lion i already
[50:50] defeated a bear this is how he overcome
[50:52] fear the church said
[50:54] get a revelation from god
[50:57] right ignore people's criticism ignore
[50:59] the doubt ignore the the clouds of
[51:02] frustration or unbelief ignore that
[51:05] and then remember what god has done
[51:07] hallelujah
[51:09] i pulled up a few documents from my old
[51:12] com my old computer
[51:15] and i found lists of all these
[51:16] testimonies
[51:18] that god had done in my ministry
[51:20] i think the last time i updated was
[51:21] 2012.
[51:23] i've literally got like five to ten
[51:26] pages of testimonies of god healing
[51:27] people
[51:28] uh saving people helping marriages and i
[51:31] forgot about all these testimonies i
[51:33] tell you i read that i thought about 10
[51:34] feet tall after that
[51:36] what well while i let the devil
[51:38] discourage me this has been a holy ghost
[51:40] ministry from the beginning hallelujah
[51:42] amen
[51:43] but it's a different phase now i'm not
[51:45] getting invitations out there that's
[51:46] fine but god wants me to focus on this
[51:48] ministry more
[51:49] even more so
[51:52] to build faith in your life to build
[51:54] character in your life
[51:55] can i say like this christ-like
[51:57] character amen
[52:00] remember what god has done
[52:04] like when i went through their brother
[52:05] and there was a brother in west virginia
[52:06] i was preaching and he said while i was
[52:08] preaching he prayed the holy ghost he'll
[52:10] heal him of a migraine
[52:11] that was probably 2005.
[52:15] i was like praise god we just had a
[52:16] migraine healed amen and then it was in
[52:18] the winter of 2010 that my wife while i
[52:20] was preaching christ the healer she said
[52:22] she got the revelation i'm a daughter of
[52:23] god i don't have to have migraines and
[52:25] she hasn't had one since she used to
[52:27] have them all the time
[52:29] now she had one that come on but she
[52:30] went to bed and that was it
[52:32] so 12 years look at that 12 years no
[52:34] migraines amen
[52:36] hallelujah
[52:37] amen
[52:39] that don't mean god's going to heal us
[52:40] every time but it shows god is the
[52:42] healer praise god
[52:44] amen
[52:46] and mo i'm sorry and david spoke about
[52:48] god twice as much
[52:50] as he did talk about goliath amen in
[52:53] other words church don't talk about your
[52:55] problems amen
[52:56] stop talking about your problems start
[52:58] talking about how big your god is amen
[53:01] hallelujah
[53:03] tell the devil how great christ is amen
[53:05] how christ blood paid for all of our
[53:08] sins and christ's blood defeats every
[53:11] devil in hell and how demons tremble at
[53:13] the name of jesus christ
[53:16] see talk more about god than your fear
[53:19] leaves
[53:20] and the church said
[53:22] talk about god twice as much for every
[53:25] time you feel a bad thought say two that
[53:27] are good good thoughts
[53:29] and watch your victory come
[53:32] hallelujah
[53:36] that's what we do with bang's dad that's
[53:37] what that picture is all about
[53:38] every time they bring up prayer said
[53:40] speak life speak a lie speak like it
[53:42] took two weeks to bring life but life
[53:43] came and life is here amen
[53:47] and then david ran to the fight he
[53:49] wasn't a procrastinator
[53:52] he dealt with a giant and he said i'm
[53:54] here god sent me here i got the
[53:56] revelation i've got the faith i've got
[53:58] the word of god i'm running to this this
[54:00] is going to end today praise god and
[54:02] yours that's what we can do you can
[54:04] leave here today with with your with
[54:06] your enemy defeated you can leave here
[54:08] today like a david amen you can leave
[54:10] here today in the power revelation and
[54:13] victory of the lord
[54:16] hallelujah
[54:17] i'm closing with this i'm bringing this
[54:19] back from a few uh well from last year
[54:21] i'm bringing this back
[54:24] three steps to being strong church if
[54:26] we're weak with fear or lust or greed or
[54:29] depression or anger or wrath anything
[54:31] whatever it is there's three steps to
[54:32] getting it back
[54:35] the first one is repentance and humility
[54:39] repent for your sins and be humble
[54:41] before the lord
[54:43] there's three steps to being strong say
[54:45] god forgive me of having uh nomophobia
[54:49] hallelujah
[54:51] jesus forgive me
[54:53] i've been destroying my relationships
[54:54] through my technoference
[54:57] technoference
[54:58] the interference of technology i've been
[55:00] letting technology interfere in my walk
[55:01] with the lord
[55:06] jesus forgive me of my cyber chondria
[55:10] i'm creating like brother man i said i'm
[55:12] crossing bridges before i even get there
[55:14] i'm creating symptoms that aren't even
[55:16] there i'm accepting devil's lies without
[55:18] you any proof
[55:20] without even consulting god about it
[55:24] forgive me of my delusion
[55:27] everybody's watching me everybody's
[55:28] going to hate me everyone's everyone's
[55:30] looking at me no
[55:32] everyone's everyone should be looking at
[55:34] christ that's the real thing
[55:36] so the first step to strength is repent
[55:39] and be humble
[55:41] the second as god told joshua remember
[55:44] god's promise and his faithfulness
[55:47] that's out of joshua 1. let's read it
[55:48] joshua 1 verse 5.
[55:52] i kind of feel like joshua tonight don't
[55:53] you
[55:54] feel like an overcomer how many feel
[55:55] strong in the lord
[55:57] and the power of his might
[55:59] joshua 1
[56:08] joshua 1 verse 5
[56:14] there shall not any man be able to stand
[56:16] before thee all the days of thy life as
[56:18] i was with moses so i be with thee i
[56:20] will not fail thee nor forsake thee
[56:23] church and the bible says in hebrews 13
[56:25] that god will never leave you or forsake
[56:26] you
[56:29] god will not leave you and god will not
[56:32] forsake you can we say amen to that
[56:35] amen he will not leave you
[56:38] he will not forsake you or push you
[56:40] aside or forget about you
[56:42] it's impossible for god to do that
[56:44] amen because he promised he wouldn't do
[56:46] it
[56:49] verse six be strong and have a good
[56:51] courage for unto this people shalt thou
[56:53] divide for inheritance the lamb which i
[56:54] swear unto their fathers to give them
[56:56] only will only do what if you want to
[56:58] possess all god has only be strong and
[57:01] very courageous
[57:03] that thou mayest observe to do according
[57:05] to all the law so when you're strong and
[57:07] courageous you'll keep the commands of
[57:09] god
[57:12] church i'm fully convinced all of us
[57:14] and everybody in the world just need to
[57:16] look at our phones less
[57:18] praise god
[57:20] look at them less
[57:22] look to the word more
[57:25] right i'm able to go on my phone and i
[57:26] can see oh yeah this is how many hours
[57:28] i've spent listening to sermons i can
[57:29] check that out and that encourages me
[57:32] praise god most time i'm driving i'm
[57:33] listening to a sermon almost every time
[57:35] i got a 20 minute drive to work 20
[57:37] minute home that's 40 minutes of sermons
[57:39] i already studied the hour or saturday
[57:40] in the morning hour two hours in the
[57:41] word of god
[57:43] then i got another hour of hearing the
[57:44] word of god and i got another 40 minutes
[57:46] on the drive home i can listen to the
[57:47] word of god
[57:51] see fill your mind with the word of god
[57:54] to be strong in the lord
[57:56] amen
[58:00] and then keep the commands and the bible
[58:02] said constantly speak them
[58:04] look at verse eight we'll finish with
[58:05] this one this book of the law shall not
[58:07] depart out of your mouth
[58:09] see quote the word speak the word speak
[58:10] the word quote god's promises but thou
[58:13] shalt meditate there in day and night
[58:15] that thou mayest observe to do according
[58:16] to all that is written therein for them
[58:18] thou shalt make thy way prosperous and
[58:20] then thou shall have good success
[58:25] remember this church
[58:27] and remember this in deuteronomy moses
[58:29] told joshua to be strong and then in
[58:31] numbers god told joshua to be strong and
[58:34] then joshua 1 the officers told joshua
[58:36] to be strong but josh wasn't strong
[58:39] until chapter 10
[58:40] when he
[58:41] took those five kings out of the cave
[58:43] and he put his foot on their necks and
[58:46] he said let all of israel know that we
[58:48] must be only strong and very courageous
[58:51] amen
[58:52] in other words church we've got to hear
[58:54] the word of god you can hear people say
[58:56] it all day but pretty soon you've got to
[58:58] make that word living your life you've
[59:00] got to obey that word let that word live
[59:02] in your life that word will become a
[59:04] reality to you and then everything
[59:05] you've heard will come out of your mouth
[59:07] amen
[59:08] hallelujah
[59:11] speak the word listen the word read the
[59:13] word until it comes out of your mouth
[59:16] until you believe it
[59:17] and then church you'll be a good success
[59:20] you'll be strong in the lord and the
[59:22] power of his might
[59:24] amen
[59:25] let's stand to our feet
[59:27] musicians can come or maokai
[59:29] remember this one if you want more faith
[59:31] the bible says build up your most holy
[59:33] faith pray in the holy spirit
[59:37] how many want to be stronger tomorrow
[59:39] amen well then pray tonight in the holy
[59:40] spirit praise god
[59:42] pray tomorrow in the holy spirit that's
[59:44] how you build up your strength
[59:46] hallelujah
[59:48] so praying is like lifting weights right
[59:50] praying is like lifting weights you're
[59:51] lifting these prayers to heaven right
[59:53] and each time you lift you get a little
[59:55] stronger
[59:56] you get stronger the more you pray the
[59:58] closer god gets
[1:00:04] now isn't this beautiful church
[1:00:06] strength and prayer is closely connected
[1:00:08] to what the love of god
[1:00:11] see keep yourself in the love of god not
[1:00:13] the fear of man
[1:00:16] you've got to choose i'm going to live
[1:00:18] in god's love
[1:00:20] i'm going to live in his strength
[1:00:22] i'm going to live in his courage
[1:00:25] i'm not going to run from the battle i'm
[1:00:26] going to run to the battle and be
[1:00:28] victorious
[1:00:29] amen
[1:00:32] build up your faith praying in the holy
[1:00:34] ghost keep yourself in the love of god
[1:00:36] because perfect love casts out all fear

[1:00:47] tonight and cast out anything that's
[1:00:49] it's hurting us right it might be

[1:00:56] god the bible says we can cast it down
[1:00:58] in fact love for god will cast it down
[1:01:01] in other words why am i worried about
[1:01:02] this i need to love god i don't need to
