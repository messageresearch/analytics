[22:44] [Music]
[23:11] [Music]
[23:14] [Applause]
[23:15] [Music]
[23:31] [Music]
[23:52] [Applause]
[23:57] [Music]
[24:39] [Applause]
[24:42] [Music]
[24:48] [Music]
[25:28] [Applause]
[25:29] [Music]
[25:39] [Applause]
[25:41] [Music]
[26:28] [Music]
[27:00] [Music]
[27:24] [Music]
[27:41] [Music]
[27:56] [Music]
[28:02] [Music]
[28:10] [Music]
[28:20] [Applause]
[28:21] see one more here we'll find our mother
[28:23] to come minister tomorrow you sing a
[28:25] song special but we're to sing a song he
[28:28] wrote what the Lord gave him the saying
[28:30] God's chosen seed brother remember
[28:33] brother any more first gave the song
[28:39] [Music]
[28:48] [Music]
[28:57] [Music]
[29:42] [Music]
[29:49] [Applause]
[29:51] [Music]
[31:27] [Applause]
[31:27] [Music]
[32:26] and try to run with it and make
[32:28] themselves something big but by the
[32:29] grace of the Lord we know it was His
[32:31] grace then lifted us up and put us in
[32:34] that place we didn't deserve it it's
[32:37] only it's only by his foreknowledge that
[32:39] by His grace he puts something in us he
[32:41] knew we would make the right choice and
[32:43] it's because he put a piece of himself
[32:45] in us a minute he can't do anything but
[32:48] make the right choice amen because it's
[32:49] him amen so brother Jesse asked you to
[32:52] sing this song
[32:53] so we'll see it by the grace of the Lord
[32:55] we're gonna sing unless your bride come
[32:58] for you all know that one do you have a
[33:02] specific key that you guys like to see
[33:04] you know all right then I'm just gonna
[33:05] start and I believe that the Lord has
[33:08] given you enough ability to keep on up
[33:11] because I usually don't know where I'm
[33:13] going with Tina so so it's just so good
[33:17] to be here and we'll just worship the
[33:18] Lord for just a minute and how many
[33:20] believe in getting in the spirit amen
[33:22] get in the spirit that's when we can
[33:25] receive something from God and then we
[33:27] can that's that's we have to get in that
[33:29] channel you know nowadays we get so many
[33:32] things maybe they go off too far on the
[33:34] carnal side of things or maybe go maybe
[33:36] even too far on the fanatical side of
[33:37] things but we want to take the Word of
[33:40] God understand that we want to give him
[33:42] real worship with worship with
[33:45] understanding we know where we stand we
[33:48] can worship in a way that the angels
[33:50] can't
[33:50] we've been worshiping the way that the
[33:52] rest of the world can't by the grace of
[33:55] God so let's just worship the Lord for a
[33:57] minute and we'll talk about Lord
[34:00] bringing his bride forth in this hour
[34:02] amen Jesus alone you always
[34:07] [Music]
[34:40] [Music]
[34:53] [Applause]
[34:55] [Music]
[35:46] [Music]
[36:59] [Music]
[38:39] [Music]
[38:58] [Music]
[39:15] [Music]
[39:49] [Music]
[40:08] [Music]
[40:34] [Music]
[41:04] lord thank you so much I'm just so
[41:09] blessed by the the gift that the Lord
[41:11] given in the instruments and everything
[41:13] like that you know I just you know I
[41:17] know brother Bram talked about you know
[41:19] maybe give somebody a rose now and
[41:21] instead of a bouquet when they're gone
[41:23] and I just I certainly appreciate
[41:25] brother Jesse you know he's always been
[41:27] such a humble individual and just
[41:31] genuine you can't mistake that and I
[41:33] believe his family exercises the same
[41:37] principles of humility and and all the
[41:41] wonderful things and just really seeking
[41:43] after the Lord and and you know I
[41:45] believe him being a pastor I believe the
[41:47] church will take on those same
[41:48] characteristics because those are the
[41:50] characteristics of Christ amen it's not
[41:51] because they're characteristics of
[41:53] brother Jesse per se but as Paul would
[41:55] say follow me as I follow Christ amen so
[41:58] that's what we want to do is regardless
[41:59] of what we do I find myself in a place
[42:02] that I have a zeal for the
[42:07] Jesus Christ I want to see him glorify
[42:12] you know in this world everything else
[42:15] is trying to be glorified everything
[42:18] however if everything you can think of
[42:20] is trying to exalt itself above the
[42:22] knowledge of God right and maybe just
[42:25] tonight I preached this message to the
[42:27] last couple of times I've ministered
[42:28] I've ministered this message but maybe
[42:30] if the Lord would allow I kind of had an
[42:32] inspiration in different direction but
[42:33] we'll see what Lord goes who want to be
[42:34] open to wherever the spirit would leave
[42:36] let's turn in our Bibles to Habakkuk
[42:39] chapter 2 if we'd all stand for the word
[42:46] and I've been ministering this a couple
[42:48] times and a couple different manners but
[42:52] we want to speak tonight on stepping
[42:53] into the vision and maybe just as a
[42:56] subtitle maybe to show where we're going
[42:59] and where if the Lord would leave that
[43:00] way we'll see I you pray for me I have I
[43:02] don't have a gift of studying per se if
[43:06] you see the way my notes look and the
[43:07] way inspiration comes it just seems so
[43:09] chaotic but you know I just trust the
[43:11] Lord we'll put it all together and you
[43:12] in your hearts and up here because it's
[43:15] not about me it's not about even the
[43:17] delivery we get so worried about
[43:18] delivery and the way it looks but if if
[43:20] the Lord could take an illiterate
[43:21] Kentuckian and break open and use him to
[43:25] break open the mysteries of the last day
[43:27] by the power of the Holy Ghost then
[43:30] certainly maybe he could the Lord would
[43:32] allow me to be a blessing to his people
[43:35] by His grace so let's see
[43:37] Habakkuk chapter 2 and then after this
[43:39] we're gonna go to 2nd Peter chapter 1
[43:42] but the the maybe the the subtitle we
[43:46] want to speak on stepping into the
[43:47] vision and as a subtitle we want to
[43:50] maybe say a glimpse of the divine a
[43:53] glimpse of the divine we just want to
[43:55] keep that in our hearts and we've seen
[43:56] where the Lord would go I feel like that
[43:57] would be pleasing unto God that we would
[43:59] go in that direction and I will start at
[44:02] verse 1 in the book of Habakkuk if it's
[44:05] maybe hard to find but it's it's right
[44:06] near the end of the Old Testament maybe
[44:09] probably only about 15 to 20 pages
[44:11] before you get to Matthew it's right
[44:13] there and I'll just wait for everybody
[44:15] to get there maybe and and I know it's
[44:18] it's not always easy with the maybe the
[44:20] humidity
[44:21] pages sticking together and especially
[44:23] with me I start to sweat but you know
[44:26] what the Lord is gracious he's good you
[44:29] know and I I tell you what I I know you
[44:32] know just I'm so grateful to the Lord
[44:34] for His grace you know as I could go we
[44:37] could go along and long and I don't want
[44:39] to keep you long I know it's a Thursday
[44:40] night maybe an odd night to have service
[44:42] but I'm just so grateful to the Lord for
[44:43] the the people of God because in this
[44:48] hour that we're living in just to come
[44:50] to a service like this is a testimony
[44:53] and the devil off often will times make
[44:55] it seamless just a small thing but the
[44:58] scripture says who had despised the day
[44:59] of small things it may seem a small
[45:02] thing in the natural mind but to God
[45:06] it's a sacrifice it is it is it is
[45:10] worthy it's a it's a sacrifice it's your
[45:13] it's your it's your sacrifice of praise
[45:15] it's your sacrifice of your time and
[45:17] Lord knows as the day's grow evil it
[45:20] seems like our time seems less and less
[45:21] how much more of a sacrifice does it
[45:23] seem to maybe just give an hour or two
[45:25] on a Wednesday or today the Thursday or
[45:27] maybe four hours on a Sunday or
[45:30] something along those lines or a little
[45:32] bit of time every day to seek after God
[45:34] even just to think there meditate upon
[45:36] the Lord yes you know I think so many
[45:38] times we get caught up in the in the
[45:41] religiosity if I could say of certain
[45:43] things oh I have to be in this certain
[45:44] place at the certain time to pray
[45:46] no the scripture says pray without
[45:48] ceasing we can tell I can fellowship
[45:51] with the Lord on my job I can pray
[45:53] before the Lord as I as I exercise or I
[45:56] or I'm eating or I'm talking with
[45:58] someone else there's there's there's
[45:59] something in the Holy Ghost in inside of
[46:02] a believer that truly I believe it's
[46:04] just constantly crying out there's a
[46:07] constant poll you know and I believe
[46:10] tonight if you could just pull upon the
[46:12] word of God yes he can bring something
[46:14] down from the gates of heaven that would
[46:17] bless your soul give you exactly what
[46:19] you have Nina for the hour that you have
[46:21] needed yes and and maybe just a little
[46:27] taste of something here don't always get
[46:28] it in your mind of an expectation of how
[46:31] it should come right but just believe
[46:33] that it will yeah
[46:35] because he never promised you how
[46:36] necessarily things would come about but
[46:40] he promised that it would when he said
[46:42] when he said by his stripes you were
[46:44] healed
[46:45] it's already done now it could happen in
[46:48] an instant it could happen over years
[46:50] yes he didn't say how he said that it
[46:53] would
[46:54] Amen I just used as an example so let's
[46:56] read in Habakkuk chapter 2 verse 1 I
[46:58] will stand upon my watch and set me upon
[47:01] the tower and will watch to see what he
[47:05] will say unto me and what I shall answer
[47:07] when I am reproved and the Lord answered
[47:09] me and said write the vision and make it
[47:12] plain upon tables that he may run that
[47:15] readeth it for the vision is yet for an
[47:17] appointed time but at the end it shall
[47:20] speak how many believed were at the end
[47:21] at the end it shall speak and not lie
[47:25] Amen the word can't lie amen though it
[47:28] Terry wait for it because it will surely
[47:31] come it will not tarry Amen and then
[47:36] we'll go to 1st Peter 2nd Peter chapter
[47:37] 1 we're in the end times I don't believe
[47:44] there could be any doubt about that oh
[47:47] you know I've heard so many disputations
[47:50] about what we like to call the message I
[47:53] just like to call it the Word of God
[47:54] revealed in our hour we like to give
[47:56] things titles that's ok no problem with
[47:59] that we got to you know but so many
[48:02] disputations about what we call the
[48:03] message and oh is he a true prophet and
[48:06] different ones rising up trying to
[48:07] dispute this and dispute that I could
[48:10] say just like brother Bram said you're a
[48:11] little too late for me I've seen too
[48:13] much I'm seeing too much of the word
[48:14] fulfilled before my eyes right now to
[48:17] doubt the Lord you know I just say
[48:21] thankful to the Lord Jesus I can't give
[48:22] him enough praise he deserves all of it
[48:25] he deserves everything that we have 2nd
[48:29] Peter chapter 1 familiar Scripture
[48:31] starting at verse 1 Simon Peter a
[48:33] servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ
[48:36] to them that have obtained like precious
[48:37] faith with us through the righteousness
[48:41] of God and our Savior Jesus Christ now
[48:45] listen how he's even addressing this
[48:47] this isn't just anybody
[48:48] he says this is to them that it obtained
[48:52] like precious faith with us through the
[48:57] righteousness of God in our Savior Jesus
[48:59] Christ how many of you have obtained to
[49:01] like precious faith amen
[49:03] I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can
[49:05] say I'm one of them I've obtained like
[49:07] precious face so what does that mean
[49:09] that means these things right here apply
[49:11] to you they're not just for everybody
[49:13] out there but these apply to you so I
[49:16] like the first part grace and peace be
[49:19] multiplied unto you through the
[49:21] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord
[49:23] according as his divine power had given
[49:27] us had given unto us all things that
[49:29] pertain unto life and godliness through
[49:31] the knowledge of him that called us to
[49:34] glory and virtue whereby are given unto
[49:36] us exceeding great and precious promises
[49:38] that by these he might be partaker of
[49:41] the divine nature having escaped the
[49:44] corruption that is in the world through
[49:46] lust and beside this giving all
[49:49] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[49:50] to virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[49:51] temperance and to temperance patience
[49:53] and to patience godliness and to
[49:55] godliness brotherly kindness and to
[49:57] brotherly kindness charity for if these
[49:59] things be in you and abound they make
[50:02] you that ye shall neither be barren nor
[50:04] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[50:06] Jesus Christ they he that lacketh these
[50:08] things is blind that cannot see afar off
[50:10] and have forgotten that he was purged
[50:12] from his old sins wherefore the rather
[50:15] brethren give diligence to make your
[50:17] calling and election sure for if you do
[50:19] these things ye shall never fall Amen
[50:22] for so an entrance shall be ministered
[50:23] unto you abundantly into the everlasting
[50:26] kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[50:28] Christ amen let us bow our heads
[50:30] Heavenly Father Lord Lord is just truly
[50:33] every single time a humbling experience
[50:35] to be before your people your chosen
[50:37] Lord the ones that you've called and
[50:39] you've ordained in this hour
[50:41] predestinated to the adoption of sons
[50:44] and daughters by your holy blood Lord
[50:47] Jesus Christ that anointing Lord the
[50:50] Holy Ghost that sealed the believer into
[50:52] the kingdom Oh God Lord that comes and
[50:55] anoint your people for your purpose Lord
[50:57] and tonight we've come Lord we believe
[50:59] according to your purpose O God that you
[51:01] opened up a way
[51:02] to be here this evening Lord Lord not to
[51:05] speak anything of ourselves Lord but
[51:07] Lord we want to speak Lord maybe about
[51:10] the vision that you would have for your
[51:11] people in this hour of God the Word of
[51:14] God that's been given in this hour to
[51:16] your bride to bring us into a fellowship

[51:20] that divine nature Lord Jesus Lawrence s
[51:23] we come this evening Lord Lord maybe
[51:26] just a small group at number Lord but
[51:28] spiritually speaking Lord how maybe tens
[51:31] of thousands of angels would be gathered

[51:36] wherever your people go Lord your
[51:38] presence goes with them Lord God and
[51:40] where two or three are gathered you're
[51:42] here in the midst Lord and Lord we're
[51:46] here for you we're here to glorify you
[51:49] though we're here to receive from you
[51:51] not from a man not from our thoughts not
[51:55] from our ideas Lord ideas or our ideas
[51:58] are useless but O God if you could just
[52:01] anoint us Lord if you could just take
[52:03] that Holy Ghost that dwells inside of us

[52:12] right now that you'd anoint your people
[52:14] anoint me Lord to get out of the way

[52:19] for them this evening Lord and above all
[52:21] things let your perfect will be done
[52:23] tonight Lord Lord may we just see the
[52:27] mighty works of God done before us Lord
[52:29] Lord may you manifest yourself amongst
[52:32] your people Lord we love you and praise
[52:34] you and give glory to the name of the
[52:36] Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be
[52:39] seated
[52:42] you know where I believe we all know
[52:45] we're living in the last days I don't
[52:47] think there could be any doubt about
[52:48] that you know and as we're talking about
[52:52] stepping into the vision as we read in
[52:56] Habakkuk there he said the vision is yet
[52:58] for an appointed time at the end it
[53:02] would speak and what it does speak it
[53:04] won't lie and we believe I believe as
[53:08] believers in this message in the
[53:11] revealed Word of the hour that we know
[53:14] we've received of
[53:17] there's a there's a vision that the
[53:20] people of God have been given to fulfill
[53:24] now the world has a vision for them
[53:29] we've heard it preached many times as it
[53:33] was in the days of Noah the earth was
[53:37] filled with violence through the the
[53:40] evil of the imaginations of man's heart
[53:43] continually and if we don't see that in
[53:46] this hour I don't know if there's ever
[53:48] been an hour there has been that way all
[53:51] they can think of is evil continually
[53:54] evil upon evil well while the people of
[53:57] God by the grace of God are building
[54:00] line upon line here a little there a
[54:03] little word upon word power upon power
[54:07] precept upon precept the world is
[54:10] building evil upon evil lust upon lust
[54:14] those worldly desires that they have why
[54:17] because they know nothing else but that
[54:20] nature they can't do anything else but
[54:23] that nature and if there's all easily
[54:27] swept up into that spirit why because
[54:30] there's there's a reason why it's
[54:33] because they have a vision that they
[54:35] have to fulfill in this hour they don't
[54:39] even know that they don't have a choice
[54:42] but to fulfill that vision why because
[54:44] they don't have they don't know the
[54:46] world they don't know that the truth of
[54:50] the scriptures they don't know the fact
[54:54] that God when he speaks he doesn't lie
[54:56] and he said it would be as it was in the
[55:00] days of lot that Sodom and Gomorrah
[55:02] conditions just wickedness just pure
[55:05] evil over and over again just worse and
[55:09] worse and worse evil seducers waxing
[55:12] worse and worse but see they don't even
[55:14] know but even then just almost like the
[55:18] dumb animals if I could say it that way
[55:20] like because anybody without the Holy
[55:23] Ghost is a brute beast and just like a
[55:26] dumb animal we've heard the press
[55:29] tell the story about the animals in
[55:31] India before the earthquake buy their
[55:33] stone walls and buy the different things
[55:35] that house even before the earthquake
[55:37] the Lord couldn't move upon just a dumb
[55:40] animal by instinct and have a move away
[55:44] why because he cares for his creation
[55:47] the Lord cares he jealous over his
[55:50] people he's jealous over his creation
[55:53] why that's why he's taking the time you
[55:57] wouldn't take the time
[55:59] six thousand plus years to come and
[56:03] cleanse the earth by water coming
[56:06] sanctify the earth by the blood of your
[56:08] only Son and then know that in a future
[56:11] you'll come in collects it with the only
[56:13] funny if you didn't care about it but
[56:17] God burners about his people he cares
[56:20] about this earth that we live but
[56:24] because he's going to bring it up fresh
[56:26] in a new born his people anyway he cares
[56:30] about it see God has got a vision for
[56:33] the earth and Satan has a vision for the
[56:37] earth we've got it eaten in his mind
[56:41] Satan right now making his eating come
[56:45] to pass before our very eyes and it's so
[56:48] easy to marvel because that group at the
[56:53] end time that bride that's as we just
[56:56] sing the song the bride that's coming
[56:58] forward is so small as it was in the
[57:03] days of Noah
[57:04] we're in eight souls were saved by water
[57:06] and we know by revelation that he was
[57:09] the type of the tribulation so even less
[57:13] than that with Enoch hey man but I think
[57:17] even said as Enoch prophesied the Lord
[57:20] cometh with ten thousands of his Saints
[57:22] amen
[57:23] I'm so glad I'm in that number hey maybe
[57:27] jehovah's witness has narrowed it down
[57:29] to get the 144,000 but i've got
[57:32] thousands and thousands and ten
[57:34] thousands of thousands so if i got no
[57:37] faith father guess I got to say I wanted
[57:39] to him
[57:40] amen yes sir but the world you know and
[57:46] I've been ministering this because it
[57:48] truly does smell me with a godly
[57:49] jealousy to see how easily the world can
[57:52] just slip right into that vision that
[57:54] the devil's got for them right they can
[57:56] go out to all their parties they can do
[57:58] all their drugs they can do all their
[58:00] immorality and different things and they
[58:02] don't even think twice because they've
[58:04] just given themselves over to a nature
[58:07] think about that they do it because
[58:11] they've given themselves over to a
[58:14] carnal nature what do we know God chose
[58:20] the man's heart Satan he went for the
[58:25] head right and worked and but what
[58:28] happened sin we know the scripture
[58:30] declares sin was condemned in the flesh
[58:32] and if you be filled with the Holy Ghost
[58:35] sealed away there's something as we like
[58:39] to say the inside of the inside
[58:41] something that you can't explain
[58:43] you know I've come to I've come to a
[58:46] realization in my life that I'm stop
[58:48] trying to explain God in any way because
[58:53] you cannot explain the supernatural you
[58:56] can't do it it was proven in the Garden
[59:02] of Eden you cannot force a revelation on
[59:04] someone by knowledge you can't do it the
[59:09] garden of eatin proved it evil brought
[59:12] forth the revelation a slain lamb Cain
[59:16] was jealous that the sacrifice was
[59:19] accepted but God not only being just and
[59:24] holy and in this day and age we like to
[59:28] use the word fair so fair not only gave
[59:33] Cain a second chance but gave him the
[59:37] blueprint without revelation he led him
[59:44] attempted enough carnivore and he proved
[59:48] what Feeny was because even when it was
[59:51] laid bare before
[59:53] couldn't do it and so is the world today
[59:57] and so many times we'll waste our breath
[1:00:00] trying to feed ourselves against the
[1:00:03] wall trying to reason somebody into the
[1:00:06] kingdom of God but really that battle
[1:00:09] comes out of your knees because it's a
[1:00:11] spiritual bed so long trying to fight
[1:00:18] toe-to-toe intellectually was Satan and
[1:00:22] you can't do it you can't even fight him
[1:00:26] intellectually with this Bible well
[1:00:30] because it takes the Holy Ghost to
[1:00:33] rightly divide the word because when
[1:00:37] Jesus was in the wilderness he said if
[1:00:40] thou be the Son of God command these
[1:00:43] stones to become bread if thou be cast
[1:00:47] thyself off and the angels will bear
[1:00:49] thee up lest at any time thou shalt cat
[1:00:51] dash thy foot against the stone
[1:00:54] repeating Scripture but yet the word
[1:00:59] itself could rightly divide the word
[1:01:02] amen because he wants to learn with you
[1:01:08] we've writers in the church age but kind
[1:01:11] of believe it was where he talks about
[1:01:12] you can taste the word and you can
[1:01:15] compare Scripture with Scripture and
[1:01:18] that is good there's nothing wrong with
[1:01:21] it we should starting to show ourselves
[1:01:23] approved as the scripture said here in
[1:01:26] Peter
[1:01:26] he said we should according as his
[1:01:30] divine power is given unto us all things
[1:01:31] that pertain unto life and godliness
[1:01:33] through the knowledge of him
[1:01:35] I believe that pertains to two
[1:01:39] intellectual as well as spiritual
[1:01:41] knowledge we ought to know these things
[1:01:43] the LORD commanded the children of
[1:01:46] Israel you know it's like brother
[1:01:47] Branham used to say like I'm not
[1:01:49] electing condoning ignorance not
[1:01:51] necessarily Oh we'll ever have to know
[1:01:54] my body no we may not be able to
[1:01:56] memorize it all but just like he said to
[1:01:59] the Israel find them before your eyes
[1:02:01] write them upon the post of your dog
[1:02:04] immerse yourself in the word these
[1:02:08] things are good but until the Holy Ghost
[1:02:11] rightly divides it your intellectual all
[1:02:14] well-meaning as it is your intellectual
[1:02:17] fighting will fall on deaf ears did not
[1:02:24] they do it to sting he could preach the
[1:02:28] word fully vindicated and what was it
[1:02:32] even intellectually they just stopped
[1:02:36] their ears and they killed the man that
[1:02:39] spirit is still alive and were beginning
[1:02:43] we're only beginning to see it
[1:02:46] manifested right now and you better
[1:02:49] believe it's only gonna get worse
[1:02:51] and if you think walk cry I'm not gonna
[1:02:54] have to suffer any of it
[1:02:56] you better think twice you better think
[1:03:01] twice because God has got to get us to a
[1:03:06] place where we look just like him and I
[1:03:10] don't know about you I can always speak
[1:03:11] for myself but I know on that there yet
[1:03:14] I can't speak for you that's between you
[1:03:17] and God but I know I'm not where I need
[1:03:20] to be yet but I know he's promised me
[1:03:23] why because he gave me a vision he gave
[1:03:27] when he gave me a revelation when they
[1:03:31] gave me the Holy Ghost in my life he
[1:03:35] gave me a vision of a rapture and I got
[1:03:39] to make it but because it wasn't me that
[1:03:42] look for it I wasn't looking for it but
[1:03:46] he gave it to me you can work yourself
[1:03:52] up into a vision all you want you can
[1:03:54] get yourself into your own carnal vision
[1:03:57] probably just the other leave you with
[1:03:59] one time at a carnal vision if I could
[1:04:00] say it this way you saw yourself as an
[1:04:03] NFL superstar I saw myself as the best
[1:04:08] fighter pilot that ever graced the skies
[1:04:11] you may see yourself and I'm especially
[1:04:14] speaking to young ones make sure you
[1:04:17] get a godly vision for your life because
[1:04:21] accepted be rooted in the Word of God
[1:04:23] and what he has for you
[1:04:26] now what someone else wants for you and
[1:04:29] it's got to line up with this but unless
[1:04:32] it be rooted in what he wants for you
[1:04:35] it'll come to naught and once you give
[1:04:40] receive that mission once you've
[1:04:42] received that I believe when you receive
[1:04:44] that Holy Ghost you've received it like
[1:04:48] whether some time you just got a glimpse
[1:04:49] of the divine you've just gotten a
[1:04:51] glimpse of it now the question is how do
[1:05:06] we go about it because I believe
[1:05:08] speaking positively and even if you
[1:05:11] don't I'm gonna speak it for you that we
[1:05:13] all got the Holy Ghost here amen I'm
[1:05:16] gonna speak it for you I'm gonna I'm
[1:05:18] gonna be positive right amen we got to
[1:05:21] be positive
[1:05:22] amen there's too much negativity in the
[1:05:24] world the world thrives on that now
[1:05:26] don't they they'd love to hear evil they
[1:05:29] love to hear bad reports they love to
[1:05:32] hear those things but we want to get a
[1:05:34] good we want to give a good report now
[1:05:38] but once you've received that vision now
[1:05:41] how do you go about it
[1:05:43] that's patience brothers and sisters
[1:05:47] patience so many times we get all revved
[1:05:51] up the Lord's given us a vision and then
[1:05:54] we run out presuming the Lord maybe gave
[1:05:58] you an idea of what Lord I want to do
[1:06:00] this you know brother and sister you're
[1:06:03] learning how to play music you've been
[1:06:05] just run out and try to play Beethoven's
[1:06:07] ninth right off the bat you might get
[1:06:11] discouraged you might give it up because
[1:06:14] you're upset because I couldn't do it
[1:06:15] right away
[1:06:16] but there's an order in a way if it's
[1:06:19] not wearing the natural and so in the
[1:06:21] spiritual that's why the scripture says
[1:06:24] lay on your ministry we got a lot of
[1:06:27] people I believe
[1:06:28] good hearts but there's a reason there's
[1:06:32] a saying that good intentions paved the
[1:06:34] way to hell because as good as your
[1:06:37] intentions are all the soup kitchens you
[1:06:40] can make all the Habitat for Humanity's
[1:06:43] you can build all the good works you can
[1:06:46] do like the kind old priest and it was
[1:06:50] at God's will for you to do it profits
[1:06:53] nothing not sure you may receive reward
[1:07:01] the Lord sent word brother Jason I were
[1:07:03] just talking about leaning a cup of cold
[1:07:05] water and his name won't be forgotten
[1:07:06] hey whatever you've done to the least of
[1:07:09] these you've done it to me I believe
[1:07:10] that what Jesus can say barely they have
[1:07:13] their reward but we've been called to
[1:07:16] something higher I believe that with all
[1:07:19] my heart
[1:07:20] we've been called to something higher
[1:07:22] we've been called to perfection we've
[1:07:26] been called to manifest Jesus Christ in
[1:07:30] his fullness as a bride maybe not just
[1:07:32] me not just you but the bride has been
[1:07:35] called to manifest the fullness of God
[1:07:38] in a multi majestic we've been called to
[1:07:43] manifest the fullness of God bodily it's
[1:07:48] just a multi-member body this time first
[1:07:51] time in Jesus Christ he was the fullness
[1:07:53] of the Godhead bodily but now in this
[1:07:56] day all that God was imparted to Christ
[1:07:59] all that Christ was reported to his
[1:08:01] church not just that's his people and
[1:08:05] he's looking he's got a vision and a
[1:08:08] purpose for your life that only you can
[1:08:11] fulfill and it has to be that way amen
[1:08:17] we know the story I kind of want to
[1:08:20] start here of how important this is
[1:08:22] we know the story maybe brother Branham
[1:08:25] told about the little baby that was sick
[1:08:28] and the Lord gave him a vision that the
[1:08:31] baby was going to be healed and it was
[1:08:34] in the house and this person was sitting
[1:08:35] over here and this other person over
[1:08:37] here and they brother Branham was going
[1:08:39] to come and pray for the baby who's
[1:08:41] going to
[1:08:41] healed it was thus saith the Lord
[1:08:42] because it was a vision and the visions
[1:08:44] don't lie so now he comes in he says
[1:08:49] brother I've seen a vision your baby's
[1:08:52] gonna be healed so it picks up the baby
[1:08:54] and prays for it the baby gets worse the
[1:08:58] mom starts crying I thought about it I
[1:09:01] mean could you imagine the stress that
[1:09:03] would have put him under
[1:09:05] he's got the vision he knows they never
[1:09:07] fail and then he realizes oh Lord I got
[1:09:11] ahead of it
[1:09:12] he forgot they were supposed to be this
[1:09:13] person here they're supposed to be other
[1:09:15] this person here and just to fast
[1:09:19] forward the story maybe a little bit we
[1:09:20] know how it ends the Lord gives him
[1:09:22] grace thank the Lord for a double
[1:09:24] portion of grace because even though
[1:09:27] many times we messed things up it's not
[1:09:31] God that ever messes it up it's us he's
[1:09:35] perfect
[1:09:36] we're the ones that messed it up too
[1:09:39] many times we're big it's easy to put
[1:09:41] blame everywhere else let's look in the
[1:09:43] mirror let's look in the mirror of God's
[1:09:46] Word where are we lining up where are we
[1:09:50] missing the mark if you can line up with
[1:09:52] this then we can get before the Lord
[1:09:55] maybe and say Lord let's find out where
[1:09:57] that ink it is or where this or that so
[1:10:00] get things right but let's look at
[1:10:02] ourselves we get out of that vision
[1:10:06] why because maybe we're moving too fast
[1:10:09] we didn't wait on God just like brother
[1:10:11] Branham in this case but he waited God
[1:10:13] had Grace and what was it what's every
[1:10:16] bit remember in the vision all things
[1:10:19] have to be in their place for the vision
[1:10:23] to come to pass that hat had to be move
[1:10:26] over here that lady with the glasses had
[1:10:28] to be sitting here brother Branham
[1:10:30] remember he got up because the one
[1:10:32] person had to be sitting in the chair he
[1:10:33] was in but what was it it was showing
[1:10:36] that God hasn't ordered two things he's
[1:10:40] got a place what is that you've got a
[1:10:43] place for you to be and the vision
[1:10:47] cannot proceed without you in that place
[1:10:52] that's how important you think about
[1:10:57] Moses he knew he was the deliverer he
[1:11:02] had a vision of what he was and said he
[1:11:06] was born a proper child he knew that he
[1:11:09] was a deliverer he looked upon the
[1:11:11] affliction of his brethren in Israel
[1:11:13] dump it in the mud pits and his heart
[1:11:16] yearns
[1:11:17] so much so that he did a great act if
[1:11:21] you look at in the natural he made a
[1:11:24] great sacrifice he esteemed the riches
[1:11:26] of Christ greater riches than those of
[1:11:29] Egypt he could have taken the easy way
[1:11:32] I'm here to tell you tonight that it's
[1:11:36] time we took the harder way it's time we
[1:11:41] took the harder way we've been coasting
[1:11:44] way too long it's we've got it too easy
[1:11:49] I'm not saying go out there break your
[1:11:52] armor you know burn your house down to
[1:11:54] make it difficult no but it's time we
[1:11:57] made the difficult choices if the things
[1:12:00] in my life that are borderline are there
[1:12:05] ideas that I have about myself if
[1:12:09] they're a vision that I've given myself
[1:12:11] for my life that maybe doesn't line up
[1:12:13] with what God's got for me we've got to
[1:12:17] get out of our mind and get his buzz
[1:12:20] it's the only way we can do this if
[1:12:24] Jesus Christ the Word made flesh had to
[1:12:29] die to his own desires you say oh he had
[1:12:34] another desired yeah the scripture study
[1:12:37] game he said eyes would that this cup
[1:12:40] pass from me
[1:12:41] he was literally and strike you
[1:12:44] understand how powerful that is he was
[1:12:47] literally expressing a natural desire
[1:12:51] that was contrary to what God he knew
[1:12:54] God wanted for him and yet the cemani
[1:12:59] the pressing the squeezing will it bring
[1:13:04] out in front of victory
[1:13:06] for you and me but we can conquer our
[1:13:09] own desires that we could be honest with
[1:13:13] ourselves place it before God and get
[1:13:17] victory have you ever really thought
[1:13:21] about that explaining new talk about
[1:13:25] someone who knew the vision what if I
[1:13:30] told you that in three days I'll race
[1:13:34] this temple back up after you tear it
[1:13:36] now and many things to the exhort about
[1:13:41] how Christ must suffer and rise again on
[1:13:44] the third day we know those scriptures
[1:13:46] he knew where he was going
[1:13:49] and yet it's the cemani the flesh
[1:13:52] remember brother Branham said the
[1:13:55] anointing left him he was left to be a
[1:13:58] man and yet the grace of God to show
[1:14:05] that he could get victory bruss by a
[1:14:09] lutea over our own desires well the
[1:14:15] brain can say we can all say our
[1:14:17] greatest enemy it's Randall Burton the
[1:14:22] greatest enemy is Jesse Smith Malachi
[1:14:25] Smith only it's ourselves why because
[1:14:30] the flesh worth against the spirit and
[1:14:33] the spirit against the flesh sin I've
[1:14:37] always missed the island this is how I
[1:14:39] mentally think about Sid condemned in
[1:14:42] the flesh sin literally by the grace of
[1:14:47] God was trapped in this flesh it can't
[1:14:51] it can't do anything but try to get out
[1:14:54] express itself through the flesh it's
[1:14:57] trying to push itself out meanwhile the
[1:15:00] Holy Ghost in your heart it's trying to
[1:15:04] push itself out one the flesh trying to
[1:15:10] push itself into your heart
[1:15:12] the Holy Ghost trying to push yourself
[1:15:14] out of your heart into the world to
[1:15:17] express Christ
[1:15:18] where do they meet they meet up here the
[1:15:21] battlefield one trying to get in the
[1:15:24] other one trying to express out now the
[1:15:27] question is what do we have to do we
[1:15:31] have to die yes to our own ideas our own
[1:15:35] thoughts you have to die to every
[1:15:40] natural sense that you have that's not
[1:15:45] just sight taste feeling hearing and
[1:15:50] smelling it's not just those it's your
[1:15:54] memory it's the it's the spoon what we
[1:15:56] call the sensitive the spirit memory
[1:15:59] conscience affection reasoning
[1:16:00] imaginations those things but you happen
[1:16:03] to die to all of them because the only
[1:16:06] thing that pleases God is faith well
[1:16:11] faith is impossible to please him that's
[1:16:15] why it's the only sense that matters it
[1:16:21] doesn't matter and it makes no
[1:16:25] difference what you can see what you
[1:16:29] feel what's your memories are what your
[1:16:32] own affections are what's your reasoning
[1:16:35] zone those all have to die no exceptions
[1:16:42] because they will do nothing but exalt
[1:16:45] themselves above God if you give place
[1:16:49] to them now I've said it before many
[1:16:52] times if it lines up with the word well
[1:16:54] that's wonderful we can go with it yes
[1:16:56] it's my affections line up with the word
[1:16:59] I love the people of God I love his word
[1:17:02] I love to be in service yes I love to
[1:17:06] sing the songs of Zion yeah you know if
[1:17:08] my imaginations are imagining how much
[1:17:11] greater I could serve the Lord when I'm
[1:17:13] over on the other side if my
[1:17:15] imaginations are imagining how how great
[1:17:19] we'll be able to just praise God over
[1:17:21] there what it's going to be like when
[1:17:23] we're walking those those streams and
[1:17:26] walking the streets of gold those are
[1:17:28] the kind of imaginations we can get
[1:17:30] behind if you're
[1:17:32] if your reasonings are to come let us
[1:17:35] reason together the Word of God let us
[1:17:38] talk together and just marvel at the
[1:17:40] that the depth of the even the
[1:17:43] intellectual knowledge of the scriptures
[1:17:45] that's that's the kind of reasoning I
[1:17:48] can get behind but as soon as it makes a
[1:17:52] turn away from the word it must die no
[1:17:57] exceptions because there will be nothing
[1:18:00] but perfect love which is God over there
[1:18:05] there won't be anything that you could
[1:18:07] be tied to that's why I say to you right
[1:18:12] now get all your own ideas out of the
[1:18:13] way that doesn't even just have to do
[1:18:16] with with the word as far as as far as
[1:18:20] understanding we know that because we
[1:18:23] can't understand it all by ourselves but
[1:18:26] I'm even I want to bring it down to a
[1:18:27] real-life level your everyday life what
[1:18:31] we call our future if we have much of a
[1:18:34] future I don't think it seems like we go
[1:18:35] on much longer but I thought that 10
[1:18:37] years ago and it gets worse and worse
[1:18:40] but the Lord's grace is so great Thank
[1:18:44] You first grace as long as much as I
[1:18:47] longed to get out of this world and this
[1:18:49] this garbage dump that people call
[1:18:52] amazing but it's horrible you know what
[1:18:54] if we're here it's for a purpose there's
[1:18:57] more grace to be given there's more
[1:18:59] seats to be reached
[1:19:00] let's thrust in the sickle for the
[1:19:03] harvest display yes oh man there may not
[1:19:06] be a lot of seats left we may be doing a
[1:19:08] lot of net casting and then a lot of
[1:19:10] casting back but we're gonna find the
[1:19:13] ones we need to a man I'm glad I'm one
[1:19:15] of Hamelin glad I kept the year 2000
[1:19:19] didn't scare all the believers away cuz
[1:19:22] I didn't come too low Jew amen praise
[1:19:27] the Lord we've got to get our own ideas
[1:19:29] out of the way and this has to do with
[1:19:31] your very life what are your life's
[1:19:35] ambition
[1:19:35] what is your life goals well I want to
[1:19:39] learn this I want to go to school for
[1:19:40] that I just I rely mainly because
[1:19:42] brother just he got so many young ones
[1:19:44] but I
[1:19:45] such a pull on that the younger side
[1:19:48] especially you ones that are getting
[1:19:51] just a little bit older you certain
[1:19:52] understand I understand that maybe we
[1:19:55] had some receipt the Holy Ghost here
[1:19:56] recently
[1:19:57] and some meetings that you had praise
[1:19:58] the Lord for that that's the first step
[1:20:01] that's a great thing
[1:20:03] no let's take that and grow in Greece
[1:20:08] let's let's let's start those virtues
[1:20:10] those virtues start to be built in you
[1:20:13] and it's not going to be easy because
[1:20:15] everyone's a battle everyone to fight
[1:20:18] the Lord's good at lemmings come along
[1:20:20] in your life they are going to expose
[1:20:22] your weaknesses and it's gonna you know
[1:20:25] what's gonna bring up it's gonna be good
[1:20:26] prize cuz you don't want others to see
[1:20:29] that you've got this problem and that's
[1:20:31] one of the things that devil really
[1:20:32] fights the people of God
[1:20:34] because what does the scripture say
[1:20:35] confess your faults one to another and
[1:20:37] pray one for the other but we won't do
[1:20:39] that because we won't admit it but
[1:20:41] there's pride and a lot of it is fear
[1:20:46] that others will judge you why because
[1:20:49] maybe they don't have love that they
[1:20:50] ought to have and you you try to confide
[1:20:52] in a brother or sister and they say oh
[1:20:54] you should leave a brother Raymond told
[1:20:57] me that's wrong is that right that's not
[1:21:01] the Spirit of Christ charity covers the
[1:21:04] multitude of sins hey man a man if it's
[1:21:11] wrong to go dig up a faith seed when you
[1:21:14] planted it then it's wrong to dig up
[1:21:17] sins when they've been cast in the sea
[1:21:19] of forgetfulness you make out a liar
[1:21:22] will you do that
[1:21:24] Gutzon I don't remember they never did
[1:21:26] and you try to bring it back in so it's
[1:21:29] fresh shave idea what it would do that I
[1:21:31] don't know where that came from but that
[1:21:33] was I believe that wasn't gone we got it
[1:21:35] we have to have loved one for the other
[1:21:38] the devil tries to put so much pride in
[1:21:41] there and fear and but the Spirit of God
[1:21:44] cast love casts out fear would it have
[1:21:49] to be fearful of that you know why
[1:21:51] because we ought to have a humility we
[1:21:54] ought to have a humility of where we
[1:21:56] came from
[1:21:57] [Music]
[1:21:59] I remember I think there's brother
[1:22:00] Brooks who said this before or maybe
[1:22:02] someone else but I really like the
[1:22:03] saying and I've used it in my prayers so
[1:22:05] many times I say Lord they might have
[1:22:08] even been sister Karen Sanders I think
[1:22:09] it might have been may I heard it from
[1:22:11] someone though they said Lord let me
[1:22:14] humble myself before you because Lord I
[1:22:17] don't want you to anbu me that's
[1:22:20] powerful to me more make us humble full
[1:22:23] of humility meek and lowly put ourselves
[1:22:26] in the lowest place why because without
[1:22:28] him you're nothing without me you can do
[1:22:31] nothing you can do nothing except you
[1:22:34] abided by otherwise if we if we could
[1:22:41] let that thing grow what'd he say it'll
[1:22:43] put forth another book of Acts behind
[1:22:45] and that's what we're looking for we're
[1:22:47] not looking for excuses
[1:22:49] we got a vision before us brothers and
[1:22:51] sisters you have a God has a vision for
[1:22:56] your life God has a vision for each one
[1:22:59] in here for your life individually the
[1:23:02] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[1:23:04] by the Lord God has a vision for you and
[1:23:09] you need to find it you need to find
[1:23:12] what it is you need to make your calling
[1:23:15] and election sure you need to find your
[1:23:17] place in the body brother Jesse can't do
[1:23:21] it why because he is also searching for
[1:23:24] his perfect place he's been put as a
[1:23:28] pastor but every every little bit of our
[1:23:31] lives is part of that vision see the
[1:23:34] Lord doesn't do anything halfway
[1:23:35] it's not just well he's not a he's not a
[1:23:38] master builder or a carpenter that's a
[1:23:42] on quarter inch off is okay no the Lord
[1:23:44] expects perfection his people will be
[1:23:47] there in their spots in the post of duty
[1:23:50] remember the vision onward Christian
[1:23:53] soldiers marching as to war with the
[1:23:55] bride just in lockstep what was at the
[1:23:57] end it started drifting what do you
[1:24:00] scream get back in line I believe with
[1:24:03] all my heart that's where we're at right
[1:24:04] now I believe that there are people
[1:24:08] ministers that are going to be telling
[1:24:10] the bride to get back in line
[1:24:12] because whether we know it or not
[1:24:14] there's something wrong there Scott
[1:24:16] there's we've gotten out of a vision
[1:24:17] some way brothers and sisters because
[1:24:19] when I read the vision when I listen the
[1:24:22] vision it was made I had this little
[1:24:26] thing that the Lord kind of gave to me I
[1:24:27] thought it was kind of cute maybe if I
[1:24:28] could see it that way we all have but
[1:24:31] maybe the app on the phone book called
[1:24:33] the table and I read that scripture of
[1:24:37] Habakkuk is his make the vision plain
[1:24:39] and write it upon tables I said we all
[1:24:42] got tables the vision has been made
[1:24:45] plain upon the tables a prophet was said
[1:24:51] to make the vision plain and what are we
[1:24:54] gonna do he that readeth let him run but
[1:24:59] what is the vision tell us the vision
[1:25:01] tell us that don't care what anybody
[1:25:02] tells you if the vine puts forth another
[1:25:05] branch it'll write a book acts behind it
[1:25:08] the vision tells me that it will be
[1:25:11] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:25:14] and forever the basic tells me that the
[1:25:19] works that I do shall he do also and
[1:25:22] greater let me show you you the vision
[1:25:25] tells me that we are to be partakers of
[1:25:28] the divine nature the vision tells me
[1:25:31] that I was predestinated before the
[1:25:34] foundation of the world to come to these
[1:25:36] things anything country to that vision
[1:25:40] is wrong why because it's it's been
[1:25:43] vindicated it's been revealed to us now
[1:25:46] the question is how do we make it work
[1:25:49] we get in our places he caught we caught
[1:25:53] we've called it the God's great
[1:25:54] timepiece God's great prophetic clock
[1:25:59] you try to put one gear or one spring
[1:26:02] out of place in your watch and see if it
[1:26:04] doesn't die instantly it won't work
[1:26:06] one person other place in this vision
[1:26:10] and it will not work as intended and we
[1:26:14] can't make it we can't get out of here
[1:26:17] until everyone's in their place we can't
[1:26:19] do it amen
[1:26:22] so what am I telling you that for he
[1:26:25] didn't say you know
[1:26:26] it sounds all brother it seems almost
[1:26:28] hopeless there's so much to it
[1:26:29] no but it's His grace that will do it
[1:26:32] and what if it's prayer it's getting on
[1:26:36] your knees before God it's going to agus
[1:26:39] ebbing for yourself it's going to a
[1:26:42] place where God can just press all of
[1:26:44] your own desires out of the way where
[1:26:46] God can just press all of your own
[1:26:49] attributes
[1:26:49] I don't want Randall Burton to exist
[1:26:52] anymore I want to be excel to express
[1:26:56] Jesus Christ that is what I want to see
[1:26:59] I want to be so yielded such a prisoner
[1:27:05] to God that is his very his very least
[1:27:09] designer is my greatest ambition hey
[1:27:14] then what he's worthy of it he's worthy
[1:27:19] of it he's given us everything it's what
[1:27:24] coin it's a reasonable sacrifice it's a
[1:27:28] reasonable service to give ourselves as
[1:27:30] living sacrifices unto God to obey is
[1:27:35] better than sacrifice yes but did you
[1:27:37] know obedience is a sacrifice obedience
[1:27:42] if sacrificing your own will for someone
[1:27:46] else's yes for the Jesse since brother
[1:27:49] Malachi I need you to help me out in the
[1:27:51] garden today the mouth kiss says no and
[1:27:54] I want to go eat that whole ball of
[1:27:55] mozzarella cheese I was watching how
[1:27:58] much you're enjoying that brother I said
[1:27:59] I can I could agree with that that's
[1:28:01] good let's hear there's nothing wrong
[1:28:02] with that well I wanna I gotta eat I
[1:28:05] gotta do this I gotta do that but the
[1:28:09] sacrifice of yes sir I'll go help you
[1:28:13] thank you that's my father's will
[1:28:14] it's to help him in this endeavor
[1:28:16] sacrificing your own desires upon the
[1:28:20] altar to fulfill the wishes of the
[1:28:23] Father that's what God wants for his
[1:28:25] people we can try all we want to to do
[1:28:30] things our way Moses tried to do it his
[1:28:33] way he just ended up with a stinking
[1:28:36] Egyptian in the sand and run it away
[1:28:38] from the presence of God
[1:28:40] one day he caught a glimpse of the
[1:28:41] divine one day he saw a bush that burns
[1:28:45] but wasn't consumed then all of a sudden
[1:28:49] things changed yes now he used to think
[1:28:52] I'm a great military man I could teach
[1:28:55] the Egyptians wisdom I was born to be a
[1:28:57] deliverer I will do this in the power of
[1:29:00] my own might - I can't even speak how
[1:29:05] would they even hear me why God had
[1:29:08] taken 40 years in the wilderness to
[1:29:10] squeeze to press to beat all of that
[1:29:16] Moses thought great about himself out of
[1:29:18] it until the only thing left was a shell
[1:29:22] to the point where Moses said I can't
[1:29:25] even speak I can't I can't do this and I
[1:29:27] can't do that and the Lord says if I
[1:29:30] could maybe paraphrase it this way the
[1:29:32] Lord says it doesn't matter because I've
[1:29:34] come down to deliver them
[1:29:37] I'm sending you but you're just a
[1:29:40] vehicle for me that's what we want for
[1:29:44] us so send are you that's the same way
[1:29:51] you say Lord I can't do it that's the
[1:29:54] point that's the point I'm jealous
[1:29:59] to give ploy to Jesus Christ because
[1:30:02] you're giving glory to everything else
[1:30:03] we've living glory to our sports we're
[1:30:08] giving glory to our politics we've given
[1:30:10] glory now to our economy and to our
[1:30:13] healthcare system to all these different
[1:30:15] things I dare say we've given glory to a
[1:30:17] prophet above God no wonder the Lord
[1:30:24] allows things you don't think the Lord
[1:30:26] allowed these believe the sign and
[1:30:29] nonsense to come up the Lord allows
[1:30:31] these things just to prove that he's in
[1:30:35] control that it doesn't matter how much
[1:30:37] you know it's by faith by grace not by
[1:30:43] knowledge net but power not by life but
[1:30:47] by my spirit and you won't stand if it's
[1:30:51] based on intellectual knowledge
[1:30:54] it can't happen God won't allow it to
[1:30:56] happen he proved in the garden as we
[1:30:58] said earlier that it can't happen
[1:30:59] it'll express itself but what it can't
[1:31:03] help but do that but I want you to know
[1:31:05] brothers and sisters it's gonna be a
[1:31:06] harder way yes it's not gonna be easy
[1:31:09] and it's time we got it out of our heads
[1:31:13] that it's going to be with it's time we
[1:31:15] separate it you know what I don't think
[1:31:16] we've completely separated from Leo to
[1:31:18] see a coin yet maybe we have spiritually
[1:31:22] in many ways but I feel like maybe
[1:31:23] mentally intellectually our own
[1:31:26] reasoning abilities we're still in
[1:31:28] Laodicea with the idea of oh you know
[1:31:32] and I praise the Lord the Lord you know
[1:31:34] the Lord went Lord allow me to write
[1:31:35] that song God's chosen seed he gave me
[1:31:38] the last few verses of that song in
[1:31:40] about 15 minutes when I was driving on
[1:31:41] the on the road to go to church in Iowa
[1:31:43] it was just the grace to go but if we're
[1:31:46] not careful we get so lifted up we're
[1:31:49] God's chosen seed we're God's chosen
[1:31:51] seed and these things are true but it on
[1:31:54] a humble us it sometimes so many times
[1:31:56] it has the reverse effect it on earth in
[1:31:58] order to humble Isidoro if we could
[1:32:00] really see the magnitude of it I believe
[1:32:02] we maybe aren't seeing the real
[1:32:04] magnitude of what we've received because
[1:32:07] knowledge puffeth up yes sir
[1:32:10] but revelry if you died believe if you
[1:32:12] have revelation brothers and sisters
[1:32:13] it'll-it'll humbly
[1:32:15] I'll bring you to a place where you see
[1:32:17] where you were well you see where you
[1:32:20] should have been no it's tough
[1:32:24] we got a lot of pop out chest anymore
[1:32:26] I've called it for a long time years now
[1:32:28] I've called it bride pride there's a lot
[1:32:31] of people with pride pride
[1:32:33] I'm bride I'm bride I'm bride you know
[1:32:36] talked with different ones that maybe
[1:32:38] back in their old days were a little
[1:32:40] more rough and tumble and would like get
[1:32:41] into fights and stuff and they said you
[1:32:43] know how you know the weakest one in the
[1:32:44] room so when that talks a lot and the
[1:32:47] one that's got to tell you about how
[1:32:48] great they are I think that might apply
[1:32:51] to a lot of Christians we got so-called
[1:32:53] bride well I'm the bride I'm the bride I
[1:32:56] don't know who you're trying to convince
[1:32:57] all right are you trying to convince
[1:32:59] yourself sure are you trying to convince
[1:33:02] me because it's between you and the Lord
[1:33:05] I'll believe Farida you
[1:33:07] but I believe I believe so much in
[1:33:09] humility humble ourselves
[1:33:12] let's get bringing ourselves logo before
[1:33:14] him amen there's the only one but it's
[1:33:16] gonna be hard it's not going to be easy
[1:33:19] Abraham and lot when they had a dispute
[1:33:22] ation between their their sheep herders
[1:33:25] and Abraham said let's go you go right
[1:33:28] I'll go left
[1:33:29] you go left I'll go right you choose
[1:33:30] your way locked he looked at the easy
[1:33:33] way he looked at the glimmering and the
[1:33:35] the shimmering of Sodom and Gomorrah the
[1:33:37] scripture said how it was well watered
[1:33:39] it was it was bountiful and and looked
[1:33:43] nice and easy now Abraham had been given
[1:33:47] a vision from God of what to expect of
[1:33:50] what he was to inherit but he didn't
[1:33:53] know he's know how it was gonna come he
[1:33:56] made his mistakes he tried to bring it
[1:33:58] himself through Hagar listening to his
[1:34:02] wife and say well let's try this maybe
[1:34:05] the Lord wants to do it this way wasn't
[1:34:06] being patient but in this case Abraham
[1:34:09] was very patient he says lied I'll let
[1:34:11] you choose you go this way I'll go that
[1:34:14] way
[1:34:15] yes and so lot pitched his tent towards
[1:34:18] Sodom and Abraham said okay I'll just go
[1:34:20] the other way not really thinking
[1:34:22] anything and what if the Lord do the
[1:34:24] Lord came right back in sinner you look
[1:34:26] north south east and west look at the
[1:34:29] stars of the sky that's your inheritance
[1:34:32] it may not have been easy for it happy
[1:34:36] easy life you know Sarah didn't get to
[1:34:39] have all the easy conveniences in Sodom
[1:34:41] and Gomorrah didn't have the fanciest
[1:34:44] clothes I guess a for you ones that are
[1:34:47] coming up a Vantage of schooling maybe
[1:34:49] didn't have the the most prestigious of
[1:34:51] careers because the devil really works
[1:34:54] on that nowadays I say especially to the
[1:34:56] sisters I feel like really gets that
[1:34:59] career-minded because we're in that
[1:35:00] feminist stage if I could say I mean
[1:35:03] that's just the way it is go through the
[1:35:05] scripture and it follows that feminist
[1:35:07] age you go read the book of Esther and
[1:35:09] look at vash tonight how pumped up she
[1:35:11] was King tried to call her into a
[1:35:13] banquet and she said I'm gonna take on
[1:35:15] my women I'm goin over here I'm taking
[1:35:17] all my churches I'm that's a feminist
[1:35:19] spirit yeah
[1:35:21] that's a puffed up spirit you better be
[1:35:24] careful about that
[1:35:25] then that goes that's for the church
[1:35:26] getting that puffed up spirit well I'm
[1:35:29] gonna do this and I'm gonna do that how
[1:35:31] about if the Lord will we shall do this
[1:35:34] or we shall do that
[1:35:35] amen amen
[1:35:38] that's the vision for the people of God
[1:35:40] is to walk in his ways walk according to
[1:35:45] his will sacrifice your will on the
[1:35:47] altar amen amen
[1:35:51] Moses he went the harder way he may have
[1:35:54] put a little more on himself that he
[1:35:55] needed to by trying to manifest it in
[1:35:59] his own way but he's still forsook all
[1:36:02] of Egypt stealing the riches of Christ
[1:36:05] greater riches you may have to forsake
[1:36:08] everything that you think it's gonna
[1:36:11] accomplish you something in this world
[1:36:13] it doesn't matter it's all gonna burn
[1:36:16] anyway we're seeing
[1:36:18] kovin 19 chucked on the economy for a
[1:36:21] month two months three months the stock
[1:36:25] market dumps down by thousands and yet
[1:36:28] we had 30 million people unemployed and
[1:36:30] the stock market went back up I'm not an
[1:36:35] economist but that seems a little fishy
[1:36:38] and if it was if our prophet told us
[1:36:41] that it was all on faceless ground back
[1:36:44] then where are we at now brother I
[1:36:47] believe we're just we're just waiting
[1:36:49] we're just waiting for that that little
[1:36:51] Catholic Church and this year just come
[1:36:53] sweep on in and come do whatever they're
[1:36:55] gonna do their work and even now don't
[1:36:57] you worry they're doing their thing
[1:36:58] they're doing what they're doing they
[1:37:00] have a vision they're gonna fulfill
[1:37:02] their vision God's got a vision for the
[1:37:06] people of God God's got a vision for
[1:37:09] that don't don't let these trials and
[1:37:11] tribulations you know we go through
[1:37:12] seasons we've all gone through seasons
[1:37:15] where we maybe lose that vision a little
[1:37:18] bit of brother branham called it the
[1:37:19] eagle eyes get filmed over here let's
[1:37:22] just stand I won't hold you any longer
[1:37:23] we're gonna close in this maybe just
[1:37:25] give you a just give you a little
[1:37:27] encouragement you know because the Lord
[1:37:30] the Lord is gonna perform it it's not
[1:37:33] gonna be by your power
[1:37:34] but the people of God have to determine
[1:37:38] in our hearts in our souls that we won't
[1:37:42] serve anything else it's only gonna be
[1:37:45] by His grace that we can do that yes but
[1:37:47] we have to come to that place we have to
[1:37:49] make voice there's got to be a choice
[1:37:51] made faith or unbelief those are the
[1:37:54] only two you've got two spirits the
[1:37:56] Spirit of God in the spirit see you
[1:37:59] choose you this day whom you will serve
[1:38:00] and it's not gonna be easy it can't be
[1:38:05] easy because Jesus didn't go the easy
[1:38:08] way he could have had the wife the house
[1:38:12] the picket fence we called nowadays all
[1:38:16] these luxuries that we could have had
[1:38:17] but no he said the son of man has no
[1:38:20] place to lay his head even Paul said
[1:38:24] having therefore food and raiment let us
[1:38:26] be contended and even say anything about
[1:38:28] having shelter we think we got a right
[1:38:31] to a house he said you got food and
[1:38:32] clothing you ought to be happy with that
[1:38:34] why because not even Jesus had a place
[1:38:36] to leave but thank the Lord we have
[1:38:39] those things we'll take it as long as we
[1:38:41] can by the grace of the Lord is long and
[1:38:44] then once the devil says we gotta line
[1:38:46] up with this thing to keep it well then
[1:38:47] that's alright I'll move on out the Lord
[1:38:50] will provide but don't feel discouraged
[1:38:53] brothers and sisters if if those eagle
[1:38:55] eyes maybe film over the Lord's given us
[1:38:59] a fishing
[1:39:00] I believe he's given it to you he's
[1:39:02] given it to you give it maybe we don't
[1:39:04] know everything of where we're supposed
[1:39:06] to be yet remember he gives you that
[1:39:08] land little by little little by little
[1:39:11] not all of the people not all the tribes
[1:39:14] were placed immediately in the land yes
[1:39:17] it was over a period of time yes what do
[1:39:20] we do in the meantime we fight for each
[1:39:22] other we'd fight for each other's ground
[1:39:24] we come together the more we fight
[1:39:27] harder for our brothers and sisters we
[1:39:30] we get on her knees that's where a
[1:39:32] battle has to take place as we get on
[1:39:34] our knees we die to ourselves what
[1:39:37] because Christ the Lord Jesus didn't
[1:39:42] live for himself he didn't live for
[1:39:44] himself he said he said I sanctify
[1:39:47] myself for theirs
[1:39:49] do you ever think about that that's
[1:39:51] eternal life we talk about all the
[1:39:52] eternal life is living for others you
[1:39:55] don't you say well I want to sanctify my
[1:39:57] life so I can get something from God
[1:39:58] well I want to say to find my life for
[1:40:00] that as well but I want to say to find
[1:40:01] my life so you can get something from
[1:40:03] the Lord it does God forbid that my life
[1:40:07] would hinder the work of God for you and
[1:40:10] we know that that will happen right but
[1:40:14] he's gonna do it for his people yes we
[1:40:17] got a week see the vision I didn't get a
[1:40:22] chance to look for the quote but I
[1:40:23] believe in brother Jesse Oh correct me
[1:40:25] if I'm wrong but I believe brother
[1:40:27] Branham talked about kind of giving like
[1:40:29] a metaphor for that healing of how you
[1:40:32] had that vision of that well person
[1:40:33] before you and what do you do you just
[1:40:36] walk one step at a time
[1:40:37] towards that well person it's the same
[1:40:40] way for your spiritual well person your
[1:40:43] spiritual well-being it may not happen
[1:40:46] overnight
[1:40:47] we've got expectations of how we think
[1:40:50] things ought to come let's make let's
[1:40:53] get our expectations out of the way and
[1:40:55] have just him as our expectations let's
[1:40:58] make him our expectation Lord I don't
[1:41:01] care how you do it but let it be just
[1:41:04] like Mary according to thy work why she
[1:41:06] didn't understand it
[1:41:08] she even kind of questioned how can
[1:41:10] these things be but in the end you know
[1:41:12] she said she cast reasoning aside said
[1:41:15] just let it be according unto me
[1:41:17] according to that word o God that's what
[1:41:20] we want
[1:41:20] yes that's what we want Lord let it be a
[1:41:24] court let the vision come in my life let
[1:41:27] me walk according to the vision you have
[1:41:28] for me let me find my place in this
[1:41:32] vision where I will be at my post of
[1:41:34] duty and then maybe the cogs of Bride of
[1:41:38] Christ fellowship start to churn a
[1:41:40] little harder they start to turn a
[1:41:42] little more with purpose maybe maybe you
[1:41:46] start to see one speaking in tongues
[1:41:48] maybe you start to see a miracle
[1:41:50] happening over here maybe you start to
[1:41:53] see a visitation of angels killing a
[1:41:55] father you say oh that's fanaticism well
[1:41:58] that's only because we haven't seen it
[1:42:00] like we ought to brothers and sister
[1:42:02] because my vision that I received for
[1:42:04] our day says that that is the
[1:42:07] inheritance that is the heritage of
[1:42:10] God's people and we can't stop until we
[1:42:14] reach that because that's ours I don't
[1:42:18] know how he's going to do it quite
[1:42:19] frankly I don't care if I could say it
[1:42:22] that bluntly because all i care is that
[1:42:26] he is glorified is that his word comes
[1:42:30] to pass in my life I want to see it come
[1:42:32] to pass in your life if and just this
[1:42:36] last little thing you know he's got he's
[1:42:38] got a vision for you each individually
[1:42:40] he's got the Lord Jesus as a vision for
[1:42:44] Bride of Christ fellowship in Akron Ohio
[1:42:46] as a body and then he's got a vision for
[1:42:50] his bride worldwide amen I may not know
[1:42:53] other details about it we don't need to
[1:42:56] know all the details about it you know
[1:42:58] we can get caught up in that it's so
[1:43:01] easy we want to know what everything's
[1:43:03] going on we like to be in the know we're
[1:43:05] in the information age right we like to
[1:43:07] know we like to know we like to see
[1:43:08] what's going on but what did the Lord
[1:43:10] say to Peter Peter said Lord what shall
[1:43:12] this man do I want to know inquiring
[1:43:16] minds want to know
[1:43:16] he said what is that to thee you follow
[1:43:18] me amen let's just purpose that in our
[1:43:21] hearts Lord let me not worry about what
[1:43:24] the rest of the world's got what the
[1:43:26] rest of the world's gonna do let me not
[1:43:28] even necessarily worry about what you're
[1:43:30] gonna do when and this person is gonna
[1:43:32] do the Lord let me find my place in this
[1:43:35] vision that you've got for me and then
[1:43:36] when I find it let me get there and stay
[1:43:38] there so that the the the purpose of the
[1:43:41] vision can come to pass amen I believe
[1:43:44] he's got it for his Saints I believe it
[1:43:46] with all my heart we're seeing that time
[1:43:49] approaching amen
[1:43:50] we're seeing that time approaching and
[1:43:53] you know I'm just grateful to the Lord
[1:43:55] and I apologize this maybe I was a
[1:43:58] little long or short I I never really
[1:44:00] know how these times go but I'm just
[1:44:03] grateful to the Lord Jesus for His grace
[1:44:05] I'm grateful then that cap stone came
[1:44:07] down crying grace grace because I am a
[1:44:11] witness that I need a double portion but
[1:44:14] he's got it for us all
[1:44:15] man let's just maybe bow our heads maybe
