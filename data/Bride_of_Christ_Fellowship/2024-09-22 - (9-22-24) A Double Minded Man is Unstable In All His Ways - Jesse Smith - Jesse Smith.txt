========================================

so I want to preach on this thought uh Wednesday you know we had a short little bible study there I I was bad on a headache you know so that's why I sat down and preached uh right from my little recliner there on Wednesday I was just too tired to kind of stand and preach that whole time but God that was the only time I felt really sick all week so I thank God for that but um we finished uh that the the sermon from uh when David numbered the people Wednesday but today you know I got this uh I've had this thought on my heart for months I've been talking about it well not at least one month the double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways so I want to look at that tonight or this morning rather the double-minded man is unstable in all his ways and the Lord Vindicated this in a couple ways you know I've I've heard different preachers preach on it I was studying it and then I'd found uh Simon preached three years ago and I was sitting in the back and I took a screenshot of one of these scriptures on the unstable man I was like something just struck me in that moment brother William probably knows what you probably know what I'm talking about something will just strike you like this is you know this might be a regular sermon but that thing just struck me and so I felt like uh it struck me for the right time and season praise God so I'm going to preach it here today uh hope it'll be a blessing to you and uh I want to start in James 1 verse 8 then we'll read James 4:8 I'm going to preach through the text of these verses vers so we get the context so we get the understanding on who he's talking to who is James talking to right we know James was likely the first book ever written down in the New Testament right he was the we'd say half brother of Jesus right uh course Jesus was not conceived of the natural seed uh but he was we'd say his stepbrother in the same family so James was a son of Joseph and Mary we believe one of they at least seven children right they at least seven so Jesus was born into a big family and God took care of him Hallelujah so God takes care as the big big families I'm a witness of that but James wrote this and U you know I've recommended this you even before I came in the message I've told people when when they became a Christian I said read the book of James for some reason the Holy Spirit put it on my heart when I first got saved I read the book of James it did so much for me it showed you the basics of Christianity just how a Christian should act right how a Christian should uh manage their daily life what kinds of things should they say how should they treat the poor you know there's so much revelation in here and they even got the latter R in here brother William even the latter rain is in the Book of James it's amazing to think all God can place inside of these books Hallelujah there's so much Revelation for us how many you believe that amen James 1 ver8 we look at a double-minded man is unstable in all notice all his ways Hallelujah James 1 ver8 let's read that then we'll read James 4:8 i' like to hear your voice if you can 1 2 3 a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways now go to 4:8 James 4:8 then we'll have a word of prayer if you have an unspoken need raise that to the Lord today now what you'll find church is that the words double-minded are only used two times in the entire Bible right here by James no one else uses them right they have different words like wavering and tossed and all these things but the only person who ever used them are James so we really need to look at the Book of James to understand this double-mindedness and I'll just say like this to begin with we all battle with this at times but again there's two degrees of It kind of like we've been looking at there's two degrees of backsliding right we looked at that a few weeks ago right there's minor and then there's major and I don't know if you caught it here but uh in this chapter here in this chapter James 4:8 we see the major double-mindedness we in James 1 is the minor James 4 is the major all right because we all feel like I'm sure we've all felt since we've been a Christian we felt like everything was unstable in our lives how many could say Amen to that right I'm not ashamed to say that amen there's been times I felt unstable in my Christian Life I thought what's going on what what is happening what in the world's going on we've all felt that and so James lists he shows two groups these groups sometimes got to battle unstable feelings and then this group has the battle unstable all right so let's read this one two three draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands ye Sinners and purify your hearts ye double-minded uh if you have a need on the heart let's just make it known to God you can raise your hand or let's just bow our heads however you want to make your need uh known to the Lord father God we thank you for today bless your people Lord they've sang your songs Lord God they've come out to the house of God bless your people Lord God they made this great effort to be here I know some are back and sickness Lord we're probably all batt on tiredness Lord just from working uh these these uh seasons of a lot of work Lord God I know a lot of people have a lot on their plates so father God just use me today but by the sweetness of the Holy Spirit Lord God help me to get out of your way and may the Holy Spirit deal with each and every heart bless each and every heart guide them discern them help them strengthen them Lord God give them the portion of the Holy Spirit Lord that they have a need of for today give them their daily bread I pray Lord God in Jesus Christ's name I ask it amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God so like I told you for over a month you know the Lord's been dealing with me on the the double-mindedness and I took a picture of Simon's sermon when he mentioned it three years ago and it's just been waiting there in my photos app you know you every every few months I got to empty out all my pictures off my phone onto my home computer because I run out of space on my phone and uh I've just always left that one there brother Simon you know he was preaching and brother Steven was sitt sitting right there where brother Claude is how many remember brother Steven he married Elizabeth right they got a little baby girl now he sent us a picture and but brother Steven was sitting right there and I took a picture in the back right where sister Anna is sitting right there and for some reason the Simon had the scriptures up there and for some reason it struck me I believe it's for this time in season so uh you know God will vindicate his word hallelujah I believe God already has Vindicated it but maybe we just haven't seen it and I haven't seen it maybe like I I thought I had till right now so let's look at this here uh by God's grace so a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways and of course you can put a double-minded woman in there as well how many know that by God's grace Hallelujah like the Bible says you know we're Kings and Priests unto God it doesn't mention the female element right it doesn't say kings and queens it just says Kings un God but so we know that includes all females as well praise God because not only are men called to pray women are called to pray Allelujah so we we know that uh it's speaking of both and here it is as well so there's double-minded men and there's double-minded women and uh the Bible speaks that we should uh overcome this by the grace of God and it gives us the uh the way to do it Hallelujah I first want to read the definition there's a couple definitions of double-mindedness it means wavering so a wavering person is unstable in all their ways they waver another word is uncertain now how many know we got a battle uncertainty especially with this election coming up I thought about my should I stack up on uh uh dry food should I stock up on toilet paper like Co you know you know you just you go through all this un uncertainty right uh another word is doubting a doubting man or woman is unstable in all their ways another definition is divided and interest a person who has divided interests well I'm interested in the world I'm interested in God too a double-minded person is unstable in the rest of their lives okay every are of their life you another uh another concordance I looked at brother William said uh double-minded means two-spirited you got two Spirits right and uh it also means uh vacillating between opinion and purpose so you just Ro it's like a rotation well my purpose is this today for the world or you know money or popularity or lust but then I then I rotate back to God now how many already can tell you know we battle this almost every day right so what is this sermon on uh very familiar right very familiar topic it's on sanctification it's on the the greatest battle ever fought how many still figh in that fight you didn't give in this week did you all right some people come to church but they actually give in right thank God they come to church but they they've given in and the the Ser the services don't help them they don't worship God oh God help us to be true worshippers praise God help us to be Warriors that will fight the good fight of Faith anybody feel like fighting today Hallelujah yeah we got to fight the devil once to try to creep in our services right we've had testimonies about that where devil right while I'm preaching the devil's on somebody's shoulder telling them to do something and we they've had to come up for prayer we've had to cast that devil off amen hallelujah we've seen it by God's grace it's a reality uh brother Bram said it it's it's part of the battle this is the battle time right where the God's got trying to get his word God's trying to get his word to his people but the enemy is trying to distract you or make you think less of the preacher or make make you think less of your brother less of your husband less of your wife you know the enemy is trying to get you to think the wrong things but we got to think the right things Hallelujah we got to get the word of God on our minds amen you got to have the love of God remember the greatest thing we can have is Charity Above All Else the Bible said have fervent charity among yourselves Hallelujah so find a way you can love your brother your sister you know anybody in the church find a way to love them think of how Christ loved you that's how you can love them Hallelujah if Jesus loved me despite my failures well I can surely love somebody else Hallelujah cu only Jesus knows and I know how much I fail amen and if Jesus can love me despite my fails surely I can express that same love to other people listen who are created in the image of Jesus that's what the Bible says how can you say you love God whom you haven't seen But then uh not love somebody that he created Hallelujah that's that's the test amen if we can love others we can surely love God hallelujah so friends we're told here by the scripture uh we're not to rotate between purposes root rotate between interests rotate uh uh or waiver back and forth between purposes and ideas we're supposed to find the truth and stay with the truth hallelujah now if You' got your Bible here James 1 verse verse two James 1 verse two and did I yes I left my Bible in the office I thought I brought that up here oh I think I got it no I don't okay that's okay I don't use I don't I'll use my uh app here James 1 vers1 if you're there it's the greeting James a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ to the 12 tribes which are scattered abroad greeting so his letter is to Jewish Christians right but we know we know the gospel of the Jews and Gentiles it coincides perfectly right how many remember that the Bible said Paul was giving the ministry to the Gentiles and Peter was giving the ministry to the circumcision and what they met what they do they argue and fuss and debate no the Bible said they gave him the right hand of Fellowship amen right is that right church so we see this was written to the early Christians who were Jews they they were of course uh they were going to be tempted to get into legalism and circumcision saves you and you must keep all the all the laws of the Torah there's wisdom in the Torah right and and many of the the moral laws still pertain to the New Testament the holy spirit gives us understanding in that Hallelujah I've wrote on that extensively I've uh preached on that extensively we should have a good understanding of that by the grace of God if not then that's Sunday questions are about s Sunday night questions and answers that's what that's for amen bring those questions boy we sure had a lot last week amen verse two my brethren counted all joy everybody say all joy joy when you fall into diverse Temptations count it a joy wow God's allow me to be tested with my health or tested with my relationships he's allowed me to be tested with my finances praise the Lord am he must know that I can pass the test amen like job amen if he is allowing me to be tested well then I can be joyful praise God I'm going to come out better after this test is over Hallelujah he's going to refine me brother Mercy he's going to let me go through the fire remember brother Paul or brother Aaron Preacher Brother Aaron riddle preached on that the remember the the seven steps of the fiery process we go through there's seven steps we got to go through the fiery process but we're going to come out more pure on the other end praise God it's no fun going through the burning it's no fun going through the trials but Paul but James says count it all joy it's going to produce Joy once you get through it it's going to produce Joy you're going to see like William has in beatress over 40 years in the message you're going to see all the trials all the church splits all the arguing all the fussing for the real believer it makes them true to God and it gives them Joy it gives them a hope for heaven hallelujah amen you know I never got to YouTube I'm going to preach on YouTube tonight A a little bit way and nice way like I always do amen I got to preach against all of our sin you know but uh in other words the the point of the fear of the Lord we'll get to that the point is you should keep growing in wisdom until the Bible says you should have all wisdom Hallelujah and I got five scriptures to prove it so can't nobody tell me that we can't have all wisdom that's not good grammar but that's true amen you know so we we should be able to look at the life of beatric and William and other saints that serving God for years say wow they're walking in all the wisdom of God we should see it in their spiritual life their their the relationships their finances and the church said I mean either God's a liar or he's not amen he God's true amen he's not a liar amen if we believe God's word and we should be a look at our lives if we're growing in the fear of the Lord growing in wisdom we should see wisdom in every area of Our Lives amen what a stability where where they just we stay faithful to God true to God we're we're we're we're stable with with all with our battles right we're stable through our trials we're just stable serving God all the time through the good times through the dancing times through the morning times we're stable we love Jesus amen and nothing's going to make us waver Hallelujah that's what I tried to make my life just to be as stable in fact we had sister Wendy visited last night and she said well I just knew you guys were going to be at home you're at home all the time I took that as a compliment I said that's because we're stable amen you don't find us running off to this and that running all over there we got to post a duty amen like uh like like that story uh uh sir con sir Knight The Splendid way I got to stay at my little uh my little well in the story there there there's a wellkeeper and when he was young he W he was a soldier for the king and he wanted to go on some great adventures and the King said well uh here's a well that we don't have a a guy to guard it anymore and so he said well I'll guard it till somebody else comes along but The Story Goes The King never let anybody else come along the king had to be the only Keeper of the of the well for 40 years he kept the well and that's a type of a pastor right pastors don't get to go out on great adventures and missionary Ventures all these things they got to keep the well but the king said you don't know you keeping the well clean has fed flocks and rivers and gone out to rivers and oceans the the the the pure Waters have fed all these people because you stayed true you kept the word clean you kept the word pure may we get a good drink of clean Holy Ghost water today Hallelujah hey amen I know what I'm talking about Amen brother William knows what I'm talking about amen right you say true to God you keep the word pure amen and it will feed the flock of God hallelujah that's right church I can't even get through verse two verse three knowing this that the trying of your faith Works patience would you say brother Jesse my faith needs to be tried yes God is going to constantly try your faith that's why every week at school we have tests every week why to make sure you're learning so why does does God giv you tests almost every day every week to make sure you're learning right to make sure you're learning make sure you pass the test amen and then he rewards you at the end of it amen just like I try to reward my kids we give them little tickets and then they can buy you know prizes like they can buy treasure box or extra recess or something like that we try to reward them doesn't God reward you praise God when you pass the test or you get through the trial of course see your faith needs constantly tried and tested but God won't give you a test you can't pass amen hallelujah verse four but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing so see you got to let patience work in your life you got to let the trials work in your life don't try to run from the trials just you know go off in some sin but stay faithful to God in the trials amen just let him come on right like here's another one well praise God if we made it through the last one we'll make it through this one praise God in other words what am I saying don't complain that we go through trials all the time God trying to test you and he just told you count it all joy he just said let your trials be a joy to you like uh you know sometimes we might think when is this ever going to let up I got news for you it's not praise God I've been serving preaching here 18 years I've been a Christian for 24 years it's not going to let up we got to keep the battle we got to keep being strong praise God we got to keep overcoming let patience have her work let God create patience in your heart Hallelujah let it make you a pillar of the chur church let it make you a real pillar of Christianity let it make you a real example of being a Christian praise God others can fall away if they want others can compromise if they want but not me I'm going to be faithful to the word of God hallelujah I'm going to let patience work in my life I'm gonna give God praise Sundays when I don't feel like it Wednesdays when I don't feel like it I'm going to keep giving God praise because I know what the Bible says hallelujah God will bless us if we do that now here's where it applies to us I believe this portion in James 1 applies to you and I I'm going to say this James 4 should not apply to you and I but some of us it might if we're not born again or we're not serving God with all of our hearts that's I'm going to say that plainly James 1 should be you and I real Believers real Christians that are dedicated love Christ want to serve Jesus Christ want to go in the Rapture they want to miss a tribulation James 1 should apply to you and I amen that's right that's right James four is a double-mindedness that will apply to the makeb believer or the foolish virgin that's my humble opinion right and just like I I preach this I have a note I want to read here who remembers when I preach that there's two kinds of backsliding who remembers that but said we backslide daily that means we turn up we turn our thoughts away from God but we don't backslide like well today I'm going to love people tomorrow I'm going to murder somebody that's that's that's the wrong kind of backsliding right or today I love my wife and tomorrow I'm going to do evil or today I love my husband but tomorrow I'm going to do evil to my husb husband you know that's that's wrong that that's the wrong kind of backsliding that's the backsliding if there's no power of God in a person's life right and remember who who remember when I preached the secret sins there's two kinds of secret sins there are secret sins that are awful like achin and like these preachers this another preacher 73 year old preacher this week he's a worldwide known preacher he's 73 and he got caught in a fair 73 and everybody thought he was the this wonderful man I we saw people they were crying oh he's my favorite preacher he's a Baptist preacher he was so Stern against everybody all these things 73 Men we better take up our cross daily and follow God Amen what am I talking about all these Temptations you're going to battle it till they put you your body in the grave amen they're going to battle it till we get our body Chang and death is swallowed up in life amen what a warning Hallelujah no matter how much you how and how well you can preach and no matter what you're gift in your life you got to keep your heart pure Hallelujah the purity of Christ Hallelujah see the more power the more influence right time goes on Satan know knows how to work on people but God knows how to deliver us amen God knows how to give us a way of Escape in every trial amen hallelujah God can help our teenagers Escape right there in the high school can he Hallelujah God can help the preachers escape the musicians amen our brothers and sisters God helps every one of us Escape if we really want to escape Hallelujah remember even King AB amik said Lord he said Lord you know the Integrity of my heart I don't want to take Sarah if she's not if she's already married and God kept him from if you want to be kept from sin God will keep you from sin Hallelujah if you really don't want to sin God will help you not to sin Hallelujah so it comes down to real sincerity Hallelujah so I showed you there's two kind and then there's a secret sin like uh David you know well David David said Lord forgive even my presumptuous sins even the sins I didn't even know I was going to be tempted by right and that that's what we have you know we have secret sin like I've said you I if I'm going to sin I don't want the people to see it I don't want anybody to see it I just want to be be between God and I that would never cause a stumbling block and say oh see I knew this preacher I knew Christianity is nothing like that I don't want to ever bring any reproach upon Christ Hallelujah that's that's what that's just my humble little Revelation that I would when I battle sin I I battle it daily but but may God help my sin to be so secret that people can't even see that I'm struggling right but I'll keep bowing I'll keep overcoming I'll keep praising God I'll keep letting patience have her perfect work amen hallelujah till the victory comes verse five now here's what you and I need if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that given that giveth to all men liberally and upth not and it shall be given to him what is he talking about he's talking about you and I going through trials and when we go through trials we feel like we don't know what to do so what do you need to do do ask God for wisdom Hallelujah remember we're getting this whole context is getting down to verse eight the double-minded man he's talking about Believers sometimes Believers even honest Believers like you and I can be unstable in all of our ways he hasn't rebuked anybody yet has he no you're going to see that in chapter four he starts rebuking people this might be a three-part series I can tell already I'm not making anything anything through here I thought this would be a short sermon man but see he's saying so when we go through trials of our patience and and we feel like oh God how much more can I take God how could you allow this to happen he said that's the moment you got to ask God for wisdom hallelujah amen give me wisdom my faith is being my patience is being tested I don't know how much more I can endure so God I need your wisdom so ask of God so when you're going through a tough time what do you got to do pray got to talk to God Church said uh is this so is it is it difficult is the Christianity really that difficult not really they asked brother Bram brother Bram how do we get closer to God he said read your Bible and pray yeah is that is that so mysterious no I mean just you you seek God first you get hungry for God you love God you praise God you draw nigh to God so he'll draw nigh to you praise God Amen but then why do we fight that so much because the devil is fighting on every hand he's trying to discourage us right he's trying to defeat us but you are more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus praise God you're more than a conqueror Hallelujah all right everybody see that now everybody doing good okay all right so look at the context it's to Believers the 12 tribes the Christians that are still Israelis but they're Christians verse six but let him ask in faith nothing wavering so that's why when you come up for Prayer church sometimes I think I've wish now you go back to your seat and you just start praising God make sure whatever we prayed for you go water that confession with praise right you got to make sure you don't lose it by the time we pray and the time you get back to your seat you sit out and you're like ah may maybe God didn't hear my prayer no you gotta you got to just walk back there and say praise God God heard me amen amen and I'm gonna wait on God God's going to give me the wisdom that I need praise God right nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like the wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed that's how we just hate to feel that don't we we feel like this circumstance will drive me to feeling like this I'm like oh I don't want to feel this again and then something else will drive me over here and now I feel this and now that we just want to be stable in our lives it's so difficult to be tossed from this emotion over to that fear and doubt and worry and anger and Stress and Anxiety we just get F all around and God said put your anchor in Jesus Christ amen ask for wisdom and and don't doubt God's going to hear your prayer amen let's not be like a wave of the sea let's be a like a ship that's got an anchor to it praise God verse seven for let not that man or woman think that he or she shall receive anything of the Lord so get the so do you see the context you're going through a trial your faith is being tested you feel like you don't have enough patience and the Bible says you better pray and ask God for wisdom and believe it or God's not going to hear you go God's not going to hear your prayer unless you have real Faith right you're going to continue to be tossed from anxiety to frustration to temptation to lust right to anger to bitterness to fear to comp you're just complex the complex toss all around but you got to say God I believe your word you're going to give me wisdom I'm trusting in God amen amen he will never fail wellow we could probably s that with a little more Gusto after this Hallelujah he will never fail me because I trust in God Amen Hallelujah then now we get to verse eight now now we see the context brother Jose don't we verse eight a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways that's right this is where we'll feel unstable uh my my my marriage feels unstable or my parenting feels unstable stable my job feels unstable my finances feel unstable my health is unstable my Direction with God my walk with God my my future feels unstable when we don't have the wisdom of God everything seems unstable but the Bible tells us ask God believe don't doubt and God will give you stability praise God hallelujah and has he rebuked anybody yet for any sin no this is for the believer this is for you and I this is for our greatest battle that we've ever fought Hallelujah is that true now I put up verse n you'll see now he switches into another thought verse n let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted okay go to verse 10 but the rich in that he has made low okay so he's now here now he's talking about the different types of the people in the church there's there's humble people right there's people that you know we're just you know wondering well they've only been to church a little while where do they stay with God but then there's poor people in the church there's rich people there's highly esteemed people so he starts off the letter by saying this you got to have a revelation of the wisdom of God for your life or else you'll be tossed all over the seas of life amen oh thank God there's an anchor in Jesus Christ today Hallelujah see and then he talks about even your uh uh yeah even of your riches or your life it's just like grass that Fades hallah the girls pick some of those uh some of those berries over at uh uh the East Liberty Park and uh I they they hit all the berries off and and uh I I I took the branches out of our van I threw them down there I come here to today to church there they are they're all withered away within one day the the Cur the day before they're beautiful green bright today they're all faded away that's what the Bible says that's what it's like riches you can't trust in riches Hallelujah can't trust in your your youth right you're gonna get old Hallelujah you can't trust in anything there all you can do is trust in the word of God hallelujah for the word of God shall not pass away Hallelujah Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall never pass away hallelujah amen two kinds of double-mindedness this is the kind that we battle well is god with me or not is God going to help me through this trial or not right am I going to make it through this year or not right that that's what we wonder God how am I going to get through this will I get through this is how's it possible that I'll overcome this with God all things are possible Amen to Believers praise God so ask God for wisdom and then claim it can I say like that this is one time Glory I know this amen this is one time you can claim this promise right for healing you don't always know if God's going to heal you for people dying you don't always know if God's going to heal you but this one you know the perfect will of God is to give you wisdom Hallelujah because it says right there if you doubt you're not going to get the wisdom but see that that's why I love you know when people come up for prayer over the years I pray for them uh they they've prayed for the peace of God in their minds and I've told them this is the perfect will of God for you to have peace in your heart you don't have to wonder does God want me to waver does God want me to be uncertain does God want me to be doubtful the answer is no yes God's going to let let you go through trials you're going to be tested it's going to be difficult but wants you to have wisdom in the midst of the trial hallelujah it's the will of God hallelujah amen I hope the holy spirit is dealing with somebody today by God's grace now uh go to chapter 4 verse one now let's look at the context of the second time James teaches on the double-minded man or woman because we can surely relate to the double mindedness of well I'm going through a trial I feel tossed all around but I'm still believer this is the one I hope we don't experience so much if we do like I said like I'll just say like this if we do with these things it's time to check up and make sure you're born again Hallelujah because even Paul in Galatians 2 or three Paul even doubted the Galatians were born again when they let circumcision back in the church he said I might have to come and uh uh work with you till you're reborn he says to make sure you got the birth because how could you be born again and allow something like this sometimes church is good for a checkup I got to go to the doctor every year for a checkup I'm actually starting to like it now because my numbers keep getting better by God's grace I'm actually liking it now it's a good time for a checkup and this is a good checkup for us right here with a double-mindedness for whence come Wars and fightings among who you the church the 12 tribes God's people what there's Wars amongst God's people sometimes there are I've been through a few have you ever been through some I got to laugh there I got a couple laughs there yeah they've seen him over the years so many wars right thank God that's why I was saying thank God for the seasons of Peace amen I didn't know what I was saying when I said that now I know what I'm saying hallelujah right that's why ASA he got those battles and God gave him 10 years a peace oh what a blessing Hallelujah but where do Wars and fightings come among you Christians message Believers come they not hence even of your what lust every war is a lust is is lust uh originated it stems from lust every fight among Christians is a a fight about lusts because if you had the love of God you wouldn't fight about it and the church said some of you already said amen you got to say Amen twice got the double amen even the lust that war in your members see so it's that sin nature inside of people they just want to go fight against that person they want to war they want to start a war against that person what is it it starts from the lust inside of them remember the Bible said in Proverbs Strife only comes from Pride how many remember that let's can you pull that up there CA uh bless your heart your hold Z and a you've been a real Warrior this weekend honey well every weekend Strife Pride I've heard yeah uh I think it's only by Pride only pardon me thank you for pay yes Proverbs 13:10 sorry only only by Pride cometh contention I was saying Strife it's the same word but it won't pull up unless you got the exact word only by Pride cometh contention but with the well advised is what wisdom so James he you know he preaches uh he writes chapters 1 2 3 chapter four he says where do Wars and stries come from among the Believers from the lust inside of them so see that's how you know when you ever get a feeling like I'm really against that brother I'm really against that that sister I got to straighten them out I'm talking about with the wrong attitude right you know pride has overtaken your life and the church said because the only reason contention will come and William and be have seen this over the years right I've seen over the years the only way that contention can come is if somebody gets prideful and they want to argue and fight about something right so what kind of people should we be as Christians should we be Fighters against each other no we should fight the devil let's save our fighting from the devil Hallelujah and the church said oh my it's beautiful oh the revelation of the word of God verse uh let's go back to James 4 verse two like I said this one's been hanging on the shelf for about over a month just waiting to preach about I'm just waiting for God's you know little push he kind of pushes me along and he'll give me a little piece there like I was telling brother Austin he gives me like a piece for the puzzle there another piece oh pretty soon I see oh they fit right there all right amen now I can see God's picture amen hallelujah verse two James 4:2 ye love and have not so people lust they don't get what they want so they start a war everybody see that so Wars in churches uh fightings in churches come because people don't get what they want so they start a war now what is it mostly most of the time it's preachers who want money I'm not surprised I didn't hear any many amens but that's the truth most of the time it's preachers who want money right because that's that's us that's how the church is run they got to have ties and offerings to run the church right other times it's for power or influence right hallelujah it's a lust that people have they lust but they don't get what they want so they start a war in the church and desire to have and cannot obtain they can't get what they want ye fight in war yet ye have not because ye ask not so here's James this this applies so much to our prayers right sometimes we sometimes we don't get things we want because we don't pray enough about it Hallelujah like you know someone come up for prayer but I might ask you know well have you prayed about it yet well if the answer is no well you gota really need to pray about it right sometimes the reason we don't have things is because we don't pray about it enough and church I'm not I'm not I'm not talking about you know it's it's it's it's it's it's the minute before bed brother William you're like Lord help me Lord I love you Jesus I'm going to bed could you do this amen you're sleeping that's that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about seeking God for it I'm talking about you're really seeking God maybe you're going to spend half an hour I remember that one time John gram and I at this altar but is over in w we prayed for 45 minutes after church for miracles and then God that next year started giving us Mira it was 2009 2010 my wife got healed of the migraines and the Miracles just kept pouring out for 45 minutes we prayed there not four seconds not four or five seconds 45 minutes everybody with me see people they want things they don't get they want because they probably haven't prayed about it enough Hallelujah am I making sense everybody yes all right everybody still with me did I lose anybody you're thinking about things over there things over there did I lose anybody verse three uh ye ask and receive not because you ask a miss that you may consume it upon your lust so now he gives us the other the other thing is one problem is you don't ask about it the other way is you ask based upon your lust so God's not going to give you that because you want it for the wrong reasons right it's something they want that they shouldn't want so God doesn't answer their prayer Hallelujah like that one time I told you the brother said I claim this woman is going to be my wife what he was asking upon is lust and she got married to somebody else he told me and he told uh somebody else he said I claim that woman she's going to be mind well you asked upon your lusts you can't claim nothing unless God told you to claim it right now he's happily married with another woman right so just he was asking upon his lust and not asking to the will of God all right now here's now here's what we're now look at verse four so this church this tells you the context verse four ye adulterers and adulteresses and he's writing to people people that are in the church so chapter one is to the people that were Christians but they're just battling you know in their mind they're battling double mindness in their mind but chapter four is these people actually committed we'd say adultery natural or spiritual right because he calls him you are adulterers and adulteresses Hallelujah know ye not that friendship with the world is hatred or enemity from God With God these people were spiritual adulterers with the world right they they had these lust that they wanted well no doubt God didn't answer their prayer God's trying to keep them from sin Hallelujah he's trying to keep them from scars and pains in their life amen right and this is this is probably natural adultery as well because what did the Corinthian Church have they had a brother in fornication sleeping with the stepmother and that was the Church of God hallelujah so see there you know there's all kinds of churches thank God that you know I know mess of churches that have had they struggle with sexual sin that doesn't mean they're not true churches it means they're immature church just like the Corinthian Church and the church said if you're still struggling with sexual sin or if you're struggling with uh suing your brother like the Corinthian Church you are an immature church amen that's right but if you can handle the Deep things of God then you're an Ephesian church amen hallelujah glory to God any Smiles out there and anybody got a smile thank you Lord amen thank you for your mercy amen he said don't you know that whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God he's telling the church this you can't commit adultery and do these things and be a friend of God you're an enemy of God why cuz you're fighting amongst each other right fighting over husbands and wives right cuz there's fightings and wars and adultery was one of them wow it just struck me right there brother Bram said brother brother William Brother Bram said this and I've heard other pre Preachers say it too in those Pentecostal moves they'd have weekends where the husbands and wives would all come to a service and they put their keys the men would put their keys in there and a different woman would take that key and go home with a different man for the weekend in Pentecostal circles brother R said he said I can't I I'd have to go look for the tape or the quote uh but brother brother R said you wouldn't believe the adulteries I've had to work with with preachers and their wives he said I'm not talking uh uh Lutheran he said Pentecostal right he's talking to the church following the message of the hour and they're struggling with fights and Wars among them some of them are adulterers in the church sleeping around well truly they're not born again right but they they know the TRU they know a little bit about the truth but what's happened they've got lust that they haven't overcome oh God help us to crucify to mortify the lust of the eyes in the flesh Hallelujah like I said I just preached a summer in those two churches and seen grown men cry and confess uh the the addiction of sexual Temptation oh but our God is mighty to save amen hallelujah amen I just I just appreciate that God you know vindicates Services God vindicates the word of God keeps us encouraged hallelujah we're on the right path amen look at verse 5 do you think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in US lust us to Envy in other words the spirit of God is jealous if the spirit of God saved you from your sin forgave you all your sin then the spirit of God wants all your love Hallelujah if God's spirit showed you love and saved you out of your life of sin God's spirit don't want you go making love to the world again God Spirit wants you to make love to God Amen he wants you Faithful Hallelujah well ra said what if you husband saw your wife going over to the neighbor's house and sleep all there and then all night and then come back to your house he said wouldn't you be upset about that of course he said but that's what the church does the church will go live in the world and come back to the house of God these things brother should not be so hallelujah amen see know does the scripture say that God's spirit is jealous God's spirit wants all of our protection attention God's spirit wants what's all of our praise Hallelujah I like verse six you all said amen to this a few months ago but he giveth more grace ah there's another good amen I like that that's a hearty amen right there but see even James said see somebody commits adultery somebody just get understand God gives more grace overcome that repent of that don't live according to your lust of your flesh crucify the lust of your flesh amen serve the Living God hallelujah wherefore he saith God resist the proud so God will resist them he won't hear their prayers he won't let them get their answers to prayers but he gives grace to the humble that's what we love about David as soon as David as soon as Nathan said you're the man he said God forgive me I'm guilty and as soon as soon as he numbered the people he said I done foolishly God help us to say that when we've sinned say Lord forgive me I've been foolish God help us every time we sin we should say Lord forgive me I was foolish I didn't want to do that but I gave in that's the kind of love that we should have for God Lord I love you so much I'll confess my sins and I'll put the blame where it needs to be right on me Hallelujah don't blame well the preacher made me do that or the uh the the brother made me do that that sister in the church or that child made me do it no you did it hallelujah it's your it's your sin in your me members Hallelujah is that right church amen well I'm glad brother Jesse's preach off September Amen brother Jesse we're getting these uh sin killing sermons here I'll heal your backslidings amen David number the people amen hallelujah I didn't I didn't know I was going to preach I thought it'd be right in the first you were here when brother Ben Rod was here said I'm going to right into the First Corinthians sermons I didn't know God had all these other ones for me I thought I'd be going right into the First Corinthians series well God knows what he's doing Hallelujah I love God he's so gracious God will resist the proud Hallelujah but he gives grace to the humble now okay now now verse seven now here we use this all the time right but in context this actually for adulterous Christians that are flirting with the or making love to the world that's actually the context here it's Wars and fightings in the church it's adulterers and adulterers in the church verse 7 submit yourselves therefore to God but how many know that will work for us too if who wants a closer walk with God so what does it mean you got to submit to God you got to obey God Amen you can't disobey God's word and think you're going to get more grace you got to obey the word of God hallelujah amen I believe the Holy Ghost is preaching this morning amen I'm just going to say that because I feel it amen hallelujah sometimes I try my best but I gotta wait till I Y over to the Holy Spirit submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he'll flee from you that's what I've told people I said you got to resist sin until Satan leaves don't give into it fight it as hard as you can whatever you have to do stay up all night whatever you have to do just pray pray till your fall asleep or Sing Sing till you fall asleep or just love that person or just pretend until it's a reality you you you know you got to love somebody even though you don't feel like it you just got to love them until you feel it praise God you got to fight against sin as you fight against sin then God will give you the overcoming Grace Hallelujah that's right church amen submit to God see you got to obey God resist the devil and he'll flee from you you can't give in on the first Temptation you can't give in on the second Temptation Jesus had to resist three times right brother William three times he had to say it's written he didn't use a miracle he didn't use a prophecy he just used the written word amen amen and that's how we can defeat the Devil every time just use the written word the Bible says this the Bible says that the Bible says that I'm obeying the Bible Hallelujah that's simple okay so we know how to overcome this brother Jesse yes repent of your sins right submit yourselves to God obey the word of God you have to resist Satan and then Satan will flee from you hallelujah how many appreciate the good news that you won't battle that mind battle forever H how many believe in Seasons where you go through seasons and you you won't always being a tough season I can say Amen to that trials and tests I've gone through they don't last forever troubles don't last always that's a good song we need to sing that troubles don't last oh troubles don't last always oh it's a good it's a good gospel song you got to pull it up on YouTube Hallelujah verse eight draw not to God so see you got to obey God's word you got to resist Satan and you got to spend time with God hallelujah draw night to God now he's remember he's talking to adulterers people that would sleep around the church draw nigh to God he'll draw nigh to you cleanse your your hands ye sinner he calls them Sinners he but in verse one he said there's Wars among you so see there's Christians that are really into sin in the church they have wars among them there's fightings among them there's adultery sexual sin among them right they're fighting at one another and he says resist right draw not to God you sinners in other words we we sinned and we got to confess our sins we got to show God that we're really sorry for what we we did that's called thorough repentance brother Bram calls it and purify your hearts ye what sound like a familiar sermon I heard one time so clean your hands don't touch those things anymore don't don't tap on those things anymore don't touch that person anymore and the church said cleanse your hands purify your hearts God help me to think the right thoughts do you remember there's three evidences of true repentance you remember that it's in the it's in the uh Greek let's see if I can remember you have to change your mind about your sin yes you have to abhor your sin and you have to make amends for your sin right so there's three things if you really want to repent you got to change your mind I'm not I don't think that anymore about that I don't I don't no I I disagree with those thoughts I now I think God's thoughts and you got I hate that I hate when I fall in that sin I hate that sin I hate it and then third I'll make up for it I'm going to draw an ey to God or if it's against a person I'm gonna go love that person I'm GNA say something nice about that person even though that person says something bad about me right that's real Christianity how many agree with that verse 9 see what I feel like church we just need more preaching of the word right the the go preacher they they it's all quotes all the time but what we need is a fresh balance we got to have quotes from brother brandom and we got to have the word right because brother Ram God's Prophet points us to the word of God hallelujah he said look in the Bible he said if there's a mistake on the quotes look in the Bible those four beautiful words glory to God Amen questions answer is part one 64 I think it is look in the Bible so oh now now we see double-minded okay so now we see double minded in a new way it's people that are making wars in the church fights in the church and adulteries in the church sexual sin in the church those are double-minded now the church that's a totally different double-mindedness than chapter one chapter one is you're going through trials oh God how am I going to make it through this financial trial how am I going to make it here and God said don't be double-minded just ask for wisdom I'll give it to you praise God that's one type of double-mindedness the other one is Mercy you are so double-minded you can say you love God and then go sleep with another man's wife or sleep with another woman's husband you call yourself a Christian repent purify your heart you sinner the Bible uses name calling so I'm going to use name calling you know you sinner right sinner right there's among you it's among the people of God just like the Corinthian Church and Paul said you didn't even mourn over it that this man everybody knew about this young man sleeping with his stepmom and nobody even mourned about no one was at the alter saying God forgive that brother for a sexual sin oh it's awful it's so sad to be in the church nobody was doing that praise God so Paul said get that brother get him out of the church amen give him over to the devil for the destruction of the flesh that his Spirit might be saved Hallelujah see church when we see sin amongst ourselves what we got to do we got to pray at the altar for people that sin against us in the church and the church said make sure I got a good Amen on that one verse eight verse n be afflicted and mourn and weep see they weren't weeping over the sexual sin adultery let your laughter be turned to mourning so see it's like that in every church every church has to be tested every church has to go through Wars fightings adulteries all just any type of sin and these people are far from God and God said confess your sin then come near to me praise God the ones that are near to God should be the the ones who mourn over sin I'm looking at everybody here because we all want to say we're near to God well then you should be the ones mourning over sin because you're the one that's close to God's heart you're a person you're a Believer after the heart of Christ so where's your mourning everyone understand what I'm saying let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness see there's a time when there's a heaviness on the church right there's a time when there's a joy in the church Victoria was just asking me Daddy uh if you're going to dance can you let me know so uh if if we if if if we dance she's going to miss out on the dancing because she can't crawl around Lydia you know around the organ I said I'll let you know when we dance well you can dance anytime you want but I thought that was really precious where she she I said well I'll let you know next time I was just about thinking about dancing last Sunday I almost danced last Sunday we were singing reason the praise I almost s there she is hallelujah see but you know you you can feel it I can feel it we can all feel it when there's heaviness on the church CU of sin we can also feel where there's Victory Hallelujah joy peace Unity so what's the recommendation in verse 10 humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up so see people that are in sin they're so low they're so I just dramatize they're so low they're so far from God but it takes humility and then God will bring you back into his presence where you feel like like oh now I'm now I'm getting something out of the word now I feel close to God now I'm loving God's word now I can get now can I I can have joy in my life even if I'm going through a trial I can have joy at church but if not see where our sin takes us our sin takes us to this place we see we feel far away from God there's no joy in it anymore right there's mourning uh there's heaviness all these things but the Bible said draw night to God he'll bring you back into his presence hallelujah hallelujah so see a double-minded person in this chapter has dirty hands and a dirty heart because he said purify your hands you Sinners purify your hearts you double-minded can everybody see this now there's two types of double-mindedness just like there's two types of backsliding just like there's two types of secret sins why because you got four types of of Believers so the wise and foolish right and you got the make believer they hang around as to unbelievers never hang around us they won't even come to church that's why said we got three kinds of Believers in every in every Gathering almost H do you but see James 1 is for the wise virgin where you're not you're not you're not adulterous you're not starting Wars and fights among you you're just struggling God I need I need faith for this trial I need wisdom in my life right now and I don't want to waver I don't want to be tossed back and forth well I know what I'm doing well no I don't feel like I know what I'm doing now I want to be stable on the will of God hallelujah now chapter four is something else they're living in adultery there are wars in the church there's fights in the church and he said you better purify your hearts in Minds in your hands you double minded same Greek word but it's on a different level the wise version she just gots it going on up here right double just struggling today I got to keep my mind right help me Jesus and maybe I'll make a little time at lunch I'll get on my knees and pray Lord Jesus stra straighten out my heart and mind today God help me to be focused on you right but that's different than the that's different from James 4 James 4 they're sleeping around they're contentions in the church they're fighting amongst each other they're going out and attacking people in the church everybody see that have I preached the Bible plainly this morning Hallelujah is that plain enough so everybody can see it glory to God what's unstable mean the Greek defines unstable as inconstant or Restless I think we all know what it's like to be restless I've been in a lot of boring meetings I'm going like this my my legs going like this when can we get out of here I'm checking my watch all the time this is so boring right we all know that Restless feeling right but this kind this kind is uh the Double minding is restless in every area so let me apply again in their health they're Restless am I going to be well am I going to be sick am I going to eat the right thing am I GNA eat the wrong thing it's always restless back and forth or Restless in finances well I have enough here oh I've got enough well no no I won't have it up here I should I spend this impulsively like like we heard last night should it be impulsive or not you know it's just back and forth all the time this restlessness this double-mindedness Hallelujah a relationship uh is relationship good is this is a it's unhealthy uh should I attack this person or should I forgive them you know it's just back and forth in everything the Bible said in all his ways everybody say all ready a all right Health finances Church relationships you name it thought life prayer life unstable there's un instability in all the ways everybody hear me today sir think long think long and hard about this amen I believe this impacts all of us because I believe I'm in James chapter 1 I don't believe I'm in James chapter 4 I'm living a Pure Life right I don't have anything against anybody in the church I love everybody in the church Hallelujah that's right that's how we have to do it we have to be examples and we want Clean Hands and we want a clean heart because the double minded in chapter 4 they got dirty hands right they've sinned they've got dirty Hearts their hearts are not pure all right it's almost 12 my goodness okay how long does that live stream say oh almost an hour okay oh we had a little longer songs Serv okay well I feel good now amen I thought i' been preaching an hour and 15 minutes already okay um I'm going to skip that um I want to look at a few examples here this going to be a part two or three here for sure sure thank you for your patience here um I think let's see help me Holy Spirit help me yeah I think I'll go this route let's go to uh 1 Samuel chapter 229 this is a man I mentioned numerous times Eli Eli I think Eli among a few other examples is a prime example of a double-minded man he's a prime example we Pi we pick him up in in 1st Samuel 2 but who remembers 1st Samuel 1 1st Samuel 1 is Hannah she said she's praying and fasting for a child and she makes a vow she's crying and weeping before God and Eli walks up and says why you drunk woman sister why you drinking in the church you a you know drunkenness and she said no no Eli my my soul is being poured out before the Lord I want a child and he said God God heard your prayer God did hear her prayer the next year you know she was expecting had Samuel right so look he's moved by God look at that brother William he's moved by God with thus sayith the Lord God heard your prayer or maybe that's a Word of Faith because she didn't have he didn't have thus say the Lord behind it but he said God heard your prayer a Word of Faith Hallelujah Assurance faith is Assurance it's a revelation of the will of God Amen said God heard your prayer Hannah you're seeking God you're fasting for a child God heard heard your prayer Hallelujah God honor that man God honored that woman but now we fast forward a few years things have turned out really awful for Eli 1st Samuel 22930 can you put up there hun so I can read it that one I didn't get time to put that in mind wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at my offering which I have commanded in my habitation and honor thy Sons above me now just leave that up there God had to visit Samuel to rebuke Eli because God couldn't visit Eli anymore Church you're just going to be surprised here you know maybe you won't be but this is so much like today people can have God speak through them but then they can be double-minded and then God won't talk to them anymore because God resists the proud remember Eli between this Eli had let his sons work the sacrifices and remember they would commit adultery oh there it is tiing perfectly thank thank you Lord amen I just I just said a little prayer Lord help me to tie this together Glory he said you adulterers and adulteresses you double-minded and Eli knows his sons are fting with these wives laying with them committing adultery and he lets them continue to do it and not only that he let them say well I'm taking the fat the the the son said I we're taking the fat and the people are like no that belongs to God and they said well you're either going to offer it or have no offering they said fine you can have it right they just fine you preachers you bunch of backx and preachers you know and the Bible said it made them hate those sacrifices well you know because it wasn't a pure sacrifice the preachers were pre was living in such sin it wouldn't allow the people to have a pure heart as they gave sacrifices to God and Eli knew it he and he and because he did this he honored his sons above God see anytime anytime we let our children or anytime we let ourselves sin we've honored ourselves and sin above God I was hoping for a little amen more Amen on that one by God's grace good buddy good always say Amen to the word of God I need me too especially when guest preachers comeing anytime we sin we've honored ourselves above God and God told and David told the people he said God will honor those who honor God hallelujah and so God's going to dishonor Eli in his death but yet he could say God gave me a word God gave Supernatural God gave me the spoken word ah there it is amen I had the spoken word power I spoke and said God heard your prayers and God manifested a child out of a barren woman he could say I've spoken the word I've done the third pole I've done all this but yet he was double-minded in his ways he said well I'll turn my cheek to that because that that's of course that's my son you know that's my family God called my family to serve God I'll just I'll just turn no no he should have went there and said no boys you're out of this even if I got to do it all myself I'll do it Hallelujah even if I have to do the whole thing myself I'll do it just to make sure it's done right Hallelujah and God was looking for him to do that sacrifice but he didn't do that he was too prideful to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people so they were living large Eli and his sons were living large well everybody else they just they weren't living like them they were living above them verse 30 look at this my goodness is it amazing how this repeats wherefore the Lord God of Israel saith I said indeed that thy house and the house of thy father should walk before me forever but now is this sound famili anybody you were given a forever promise but because you disobeyed it's taken from you that's King Saul God Samuel told Saul you'll have it forever but because you disobey God's taking it from you give it to somebody better a man after my own heart hallelujah how many people have lost forever promises know for Generations your family would have been here if you just would serve God if you just would have been faithful I Believe In Forever promises amen now the forever promise we're going for is eternal life amen hallelujah but see there's generational promises that go along with people right that's what Esau and Jacob was all about Esau's like I don't care about this Birthright just give me the food let me just feed my flesh I'm just hungry but Jacob was like I want the spiritual blessings I want to be connected to the Messiah I want to be connected to God I want to walk like God change my walk so that I can go from Jacob supplanter to to Israel a prince of Power with God and Men Hallelujah in other words put me in the family of God Amen make me a spiritual Warrior for the faith Hallelujah but now the Lord sayi be it far from me for them that honor me I will honor and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed look what the sons were doing it just struck me now the sons were causing a war in the church they were causing war against the people bringing offerings and he just Eli Just Let It Go but yet he had the power of the spoken word I speak to you had he right right something something like that now brother man was a true true man of God what I'm saying is that Eli had that same power speak the word Hannah it's yours oh but I'll turn a blinded eye towards the sin this the wars in the church I won't address it no you better root it out you better get it out of there or it's going to turn into something like this and remember his second sin remember his second sin he let the lights go out in the Holy place the holy place is right here how many how many know this is the outer Court Bo we sure take a good care of our outer Court brother Mai you took good care of the outer court today buddy look at him brother Jose you look so good on the outer Court he he looked so good last week you look good every week brother but you know what I'm saying we take so much time boy I did my hair this morning got the got everything all dressed up nice and ready that's the outer Court the holy places right here the spirit the mind did you get your thoughts on the right things today Hallelujah did you cast down did you cast down did we cast down anything that exalts itself against the word of God before we're coming to church that's what Eli forsook he let the light go out and the Bible said the the seven manora was the light and and the Bible said ye are the light of the world Amen so the Candlestick represent the church ages the light of the world and Eli let the light of his church age go out Hallelujah because he let sin come in the church Hallelujah so not only that he let his sons do all this he he stopped the service for the holy place so what that means the Hol of holies is going to come back and rebuke him see that because he he oh I just shck me right there my goodness the outer Court was was was uh polluted just struck me the outer Court was polluted the holy place was polluted so nobody was getting to the Hol of holies so God had to send somebody else God had to send a revivalist a real prophet of God man named Samuel hallelujah oh my that's beautiful I never seen that brother the OU Court was polluted the most holy place I'm sorry the holy place was polluted so nobody was getting into God's presence so God had to send a a fresh Revival oh God send us a fresh Revival amen people that love God Amen people that will purify their hearts and their minds people that will be single-minded not double-minded Hallelujah so Eli would flip he'd be like oh yes praise the Lord and the next thing he' like oh that's okay I'll let that sin go oh no praise the Lord hallelujah glory to God I believe the message no no I'm going to do this I'm going allow this to happen see how he's double-minded can everybody see that and God had to tell this brother William to a little boy Eli was so far from God he had to have a little child rebuke him think about that oh my goodness a child out of the mouth of babes God has perfected praise that's speaking of Praise but here now we can see it also speaks of the wisdom of God hallelujah so you children just know children look at me just know God can use your questions right God can use your worship for God God can use that to help out some of us adults sometimes right little Z right Jen if you love God and you talk think about praying and worshiping your love for God can help some of us older Saints some of us mature mature Saints because that's what God did with Eli a man of God preacher right priest all right look at that go to chapter 3: 13 a first 1 Samuel 3:13 I'm almost done I I'm almost done I can see how I could preach on this I could probably preach for four hours on this topic here so I better stop after this one give me a couple more uh couple more minutes by God's grace 1st Samuel 3 13 and 14 13 for I have told him that I will judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knows stop right there leave it up there church see there's things in our lives we know it's wrong church if we don't get out of our Lives God's going to make us suffer and it's not going to be our it's not going to be God's fault it's our fault if you know you have iniquity and you don't do something about it it's time to it's time to get chased time for a big spanking and the church said he knew it he knew my son shouldn't be sleeping around he knew my son shouldn't be uh taking the sacrifice he knew he knew uh there should be light in the Sint in the Holy Place uh so how does that apply to us well brother Jesse you know your life Hallelujah you know what the Bible says everybody here know what the Bible says I know you do because you ask such deep questions sometimes I say I don't know the answer and I'm supposed to be the one who's studying the Bible all the time and I am but sometimes I don't know Hallelujah bless you see that it's the iniquities that we know that's the one we got to confess that's the one we got to overcome Hallelujah church that's what God demands of us if we really want our first love if we want our first love what is the fear of the Lord loving obedience what do how do we want to serve god with loving obedience but if iniquity gets in there what happens it it feel it feels like listen it feels like we love sin more than we would love God that's what it feels like because we're feeling with the members the sinful members of our flesh does everybody understand you think why don't I love God anymore why don't I love worshiping God why don't I love going to the house of God praising God why don't I love my brother and sister anymore something got in there an evil spirit some iniquity got in there because his sons made themselves vile and he restrained them not so of course what is restrain like you got to I know you got to restrain the dogs don't you sometimes yeah you got to hold them back right so Eli let's use that picture Eli had his sons like dogs they were dogs actually they had dog nature uh and see he should have kept them back from going after the women he should have kept them back from from uh disrupting or dishonoring the sacrifices but look he let go the leash sister let go the leash and what those what what do those untrained dogs do when they're off the leash what would they do they'll attack and so like wolves their two sons go over there they attack the women and try to get up all the adultery they can and then they attack and try to get all the food they can and the Bible said they made themselves overweight because of of the lust of the flesh lust of the eyes pride of life Hallelujah hope this is hitting home with somebody Hallelujah you don't have to say Amen too loud on that one verse 14 see his job as a preacher was to restrain them hold them back if I know sin if I if I know there sin if I know there s sin in these dogs I'm going to hold them back I'm not going to let them ravish and attack that's what our job is as parent parents that's what my job as is as a pastor right restrain Hallelujah to lead by example and therefore I've sworn unto the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering forever Hallelujah so let's look at Eli for a moment was he unstable in all his ways uh while you're waiting I put up 1st Samuel 4:13 was his health unstable yes he was so overweight when he heard about the ark being taken he fell his his weight caused him to fall over he almost passed out hit his head and he died because he was overweight and his sons were too the the Bible said that they made themselves overweight with the sacrifices now how do they I better not say nothing about that so he was unstable in his health uh yes he was unstable in his parenting and the church said couldn't parent them the right way God bless you Faithful parents God bless you Faithful grandparents Hallelujah that's right be faithful be faithful parents but he would sometimes oh it's okay if they do this no you better not do that oh it's okay if you do this un just unstable it's okay for you to sleep with them no no well you we better we got to go to church we got to go to church uh it's okay for you to sleep with them you know just back and forth so part I'll say like this partly obeying God partly disobeying God church we want to love God with all of our what Hearts soul mind strength heart soul mind strength give it all to God why Church why would we want to hold anything back from God he's he's our maker he formed us why would we want to hold anything back from god let's give God all of us I tell you it's a joy to give God all of you because now you finally feel free he's got all of me amen he's got every part of my life I've given to him everything amen hallelujah he's got full control he can do whatever he wants in my life I'm right here hallelujah brother man said God knows where to find you don't don't ever think you ever fall out of God's sight God knows right where you are and he'll use you right when he wants to use you that's a peace of God I live with that brother William for decades God's going to use me whenever he wants to use me if he wants to send me to Iowa to preach against porn I'll do that praise God the one the one brother was there he was visiting from Texas he goes to a big a mega mega church wonderful church as far as I know in Texas and he he got up and he said he told me he said brother Jesse he said you know brother he said you can preach that because you've experienced that now I don't know if it's a compliment or a rebuke because he's like in other words he's saying I've never I've never been there and that that might be the case but see God couldn't use him to preach it because he's never struggled with it see what you've struggled with and what you've overcame God can use you to help somebody else overcome Hallelujah so he was writing what he said but I don't know if it was an attack or if it was a blessing or a compliment oh yeah you were you there that's right yeah you out there yeah I don't know if you heard it or not at the table so I I know well is that a compliment or a blessing or curse or I'm sorry a rebuke or a blessing so I don't know but see that's what we got to be mindful of church we gotta be we got to make sure we're not unstable in our parenting or in our health some people say I want to be healthy and you drink all this popping nonsense or all all sugary coffee like you're double-minded right you can't you can't do that and say I'm GNA get healthy right you're double-minded see you you go back and forth right but that I'll say like this that might be just one like for me that was one place where I struggled I preach it I don't think I don't think Austin Lena were there that day when I preach I preach it over there in that Sanctuary I think you guys were sick that day I showed a slideshow with all the things I used to eat and amount of sugar in them I think you guys were sick that day but so in my life at that time when I had all those uh rashes that was my one struggle I wasn't double minded with the word it was just that I was D just double minded with that area of my life I thought well hey I'm a preacher I work hard I might as well get some uh Dr Pepper and a Baconator after work I might as well I'm a preacher I mean I work hard you know what a bunch of nonsense what a bunch of double-mindedness I I deserve a big bacon ater I worked hard this week well then it turns in not just once a week now it's twice a week now it's three times a week and now you got an infection now you're sick I know see I know what I'm preaching I'm not preaching something I don't know I know what I'm preaching amen right we we all know what double-mindedness is like so Eli's this classic example unstable in his health unstable with parenting unstable spiritual he'll go to church he'll let them sacrifice but the Suns ruined the sacrifice and don't have light in the sanctu the sanctuary of the Holy Place partially serve God not all the way purify your hearts you double-minded purify your hands ye Sinners that's what Eli didn't do he should have purified his hand say son Sons I'm kicking you out you you're done then he you should have said people bring me the oil we don't you know we don't have we don't have oil in the Holy place we're breaking the word of God he should have said bring the oil right he should have said no I don't need any more food I'm good this is all my body needs I don't have to Gorge myself every time I eat and the church said amen we don't have to do that we don't have to have snacks between meals you don't have to eat every single meal you can fast sometimes said I mean it's just ridiculous but it's a double-minded this why I do this no I do this no sometimes I'm good some no let's be Let's Be True in every area of our life Hallelujah let's be stable in our lives amen one more verse and then I'm going to stop it I want to share a little quick testimony but that's not going to be on the live stream okay um because it's a more personal one so Eli trembles oh yeah yeah yeah I'm sorry 44 I I didn't see there it is I want you to see this church look how double-minded this man was and when he came Lo Eli so Eli's waiting for news what how how' the battle go uh did did we get the victory is the ark still ours Eli sat on a upon a seat by the wayside watching for his heart trembled at the Ark of God and when the man came into the city he told it and the city cried out now the next verse I think he falls over and dies could you read 14 okay uh next one 15 oh he falls in 18 thanks me put up 18 and it came to pass when he mentioned the Ark of God that he fell fell from his seat backward by the side of the gate his neck break and he died for he was why cuz he was old man and why heavy see it's going to catch up to you if we don't take if we're not stable in every area of our life it's going to catch up to us somehow these people we've seen so many people my wife and I they get sick and oh God God you know oh God the devil gave me cancer but they were addicted to pop or whatever they lived unhealthy they did it to themselves oh God deliver me from diabetes but you ate wrong the whole all those years and brother man said it's not a demon it's a chemical thing he said I got a quote where brother says that change the way you're eating right all so just unstable right oh yeah I'm a healthy person no you're not you you can't be both amen you got to be one or the other praise God now go back to 13 you've been a good audience everybody been real patient with me amen but I trust the spirit of God's talking to somebody here amen I because I know one's talking to me sister Anna right brother Mercy I know Spirit of God's dealing with me I want to be a single minded Christian because I know what it's like to be double minded I know what it's like to oh did God hear me brother William oh God am I right in my life am I doing anything right in my life have I missed the will of God somewhere where where where do I stand with God am I the only one that ever felt that way maybe I'm only one but notice what did he how did his heart how did his art feel how did his heart feel for the Ark of God everybody he tremble so when when he would when he would Minister he he he would start talking about the Ark of God and he would he get so serious he say oh God thank you for your presence but then he could turn right around in a moment look at his sons and say how how the sacrific go oh good we got a lot of fat today oh my and his sons might say well I got a lot of phone numbers of the girls today I got a lot of their Instagram links or whatever you know I don't even know what it is I got a lot of their Tik toks today or whatever I don't know I'll say like this the talk is ticking on your ticktock that's what I'll say that's right Jesus coming back and their clock is ticking oh yes sir their sin will find them out amen just like I found out that 73 year old preacher just like I found out that message preacher over there uh in April he fell away he was going after high school girls a message preacher your sin is going to find you out your clock is ticking that's right church God help us but see he' be so so so holy he would TR he would feel the presence of God oh God the Ark of God and then he'd allow himself to do iniquity that he knew he shouldn't do that's just like people today brother William here's one way I've seen this I've shared this before but some of you might forgot we've had people we've known people in our church that say oh when brother Diggs is coming oh when brother uh McBride's coming oh when brother B oh brother Cam's coming brother Brooks and they'll get all they start trembling brother they like oh God's going to bless us and yet when it comes to me preaching or you know some Simon they're like they'll fallen asleep during the service they'll be late to church maybe not come to church skip church and not let me know where they're at brother Ram said you should ask now this is not a law but brother said you should ask your pastor permission to miss Services now how come people don't say Amen to that they like other quotes but they don't like that quote I know there's no I know I know there's no scripture for it but it's just it's just a thing of respect brother BR said if you're going to miss your home service to come to my meetings be prayed for he said at least let your pastor know ask permission from your pastor CU he's expecting you to be there to help the service your post of Duty look up but church I've seen that over the years oh yeah yeah one one time my brother came and said oh brother we had the greatest meetings these big name I I love the big name preachers too now they're off the word but the brother came he said oh we felt like the Rapture was going to happen we had such a Revival and the very next week skip church the week after that he was falling asleep in our services what happened to that great Revival were the greatest meanings you ever had how come that didn't last it's because you're double-minded Hallelujah you tremble at the you're just an Eli I'll say like that you're an Eli amen you can tremble at God's presence when when when it works for you or or or you know when you have your lusts met or all these things but you don't honor God every day God wants an everyday honored life of Christianity amen God wants a consecrated single-minded Christian walk amen God help us not to be Eli well when that preacher comes then we'll finally have church why can't we have it now now don't get wrong don't I love special meetings too I get excited too but like I told you with Brother McBride we prayed what was it um Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday we prayed uh two and a half or three extra hours and I thought we're going to have a dancing service well it turned out a little different sometimes God does different things than what we think I was praying thinking oh God bless us with dancing rejoicing Miracles we got something else didn't we Hallelujah did we still get the word the Lord yes in fact my wife said she's never seen God so uh so thoroughly give us a word from the Lord than when brother Denis McBride was here last I thought that was quite a thing but see if we tremble at brother McBride but we don't tremble just at the pastor or just at brother Simon or you know the people we hear the most well then what are we doing we're playing favorites and we'll tremble at the Ark of God but then we'll allow iniquity in our lives see church it's the stability there it is it's the stability God give us stability where we don't wander off the path and then wander back in can we just have some singleness of mind can we just have a real fire for God all the days of our life how many want that by God's grace let's stand on our feet God bless
