========================================

however much illegal s you can lay would sleep with anybody can anybody spider to up and they're trying to pull them down into this with see the elect we're not deceived amen yeah because he let cannot be to see name ahead it's impossible for the elected me to see but see that's the doctrine obey them to invite you away from your place of safety for the message of the hour and bring you into a church that will let you sit I want to come to church that will let me be free of the Holy Ghost amen that's what I've longed for these 11 years that's what I preach far as a pastor that will be free that the water yew tree will be pure water not satiate of water but pure for the word of God and then and they fell for it that's my church you know you know i seek my friends many times you on facebook or different places and even want to talk to that index 7 i'll say you know we're having Church done rabbit prayer excited it's a starry night of friday night no we have to say I service that long going and I was talking some friends died oh we're going to the we're going to the ohio state game tonight and they got all painted up a dress and this is what it felt like to be like they're going off the big some big feast and here we are church praying for that you know singing worshipping God giving God praise they go to their feet we go to our cakes amen I know you the VC on the Word of God on an area i watch off actual compromise in that kind of atmosphere the music freaks to do start tap it or not even start seeing your old Psalms and all these things like that Oh be careful Megaman right that's a fatal forgetteth where they overwrite the elect will be kept out of that by the grace of God and bailed note if God wanted curse then he take them over on this denominational side and caused the anger of God and killed him anyhow then let God kill them himself if he could ever get them out of the way of truth see some male knew that I can't curse them but if I could lead them into sin God will kill them and that's just what Balon wanted but madam said as soon as you walk out and join a church instead of receiving the backs of the Holy Ghost you're dead not for you but on here I'm not that soap then you're on you have a name said the Luthor here of the Tsar's age that word Cyrus me is dead and when they have committed spiritual fortifications up there at Pergamos the church married from the baptism of the Holy Ghost to a denomination they became dead there you are that's what the Bible said that's what God said speaking to the churches so just stop in a moment balans feast was physical form vacations and program brings that to the Peugeot be in church age and said this is spiritual fornication let me show you the type here so the Caribbean church age they were led by Constantine okay the days of Moses never led by Balin this is the doctrine of Balaam Constantine a big council called the Council of Nicaea veo had a big feast called the feast of lpr at that piece of Constantine they had spiritual fornications you know what it was big on who's big on the Trinity i'ma show that by history church who knows with the name of the the Creed of the trainees call the Nicene Creed the Athanasian Creed is a couple all these people that involved about em said that's where the church at a false Church committed spiritual fornication and took the doctrine of Balaam that's right but see a days of Moses with baiting them he had natural fornications but false doctrine is spiritual fortification that's why I'm talking about that the table only move that's why we tell you about you know the seven thunders and the different moves that are off the Word of God the perugia move that says God's already here we don't need to pass some frame r rd2 millennium that's called a post-millennial doctor but never said that's from hell he said he said cuz they're joining their millennium now he said but the millennium is to come they then in the after the day of the Lord ray Scott now go two numbers 23 9 if you got you by the way with numbers 23 9 this is the gold nugget but may I was talking about I got a quote at the end of the service where brother said he never knew how evil organizations were a few days ago so that was in the week of December the seventh of nineteen sixty he said I never knew why indented organization so much until a few days ago and here's the script of truth numbers 23 9 let's read that together three one two three four from the top of the rocks I see him and from the hills i behold him know the people shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoning among the nations he say praise the Lord praise the Lord by the way I'm use this quote to say this he says I'll prove to you its rose not at the nomination amen he said that in a retread rope numbers 2390 says does that sell it they were not a denomination amongst either not amongst the other nations oh they were Wanderers in pants Ali's down the street corner a little mission get behind the rest they keep them out God was one thing that it goes somewhere else see Wanderers right this is up Hebrews 11 say that they wonder from place to place praise God that's how Israel was they were no organization they 12 alone with God's prophet and the pillar of fire and that's a weed I do we follow with god's holy spirit ray scott and the message that God sent through his property man that we drove off some women were talking to me the week before he shoots it or you guys getting ready to church they don't go past you looking ready for the churchmen you know all your visitors going to cut my studies classes I said we don't get too many visitors because we're not an organization to have visitors got to have a huge building right how to butcher oh the water too different it's not attractive to the worldly mind and most people only come on Easter anyway are just Christmas Christian for Christmas and Easter Christian who's there not even Christian they're not and so I just kind of said well yeah I can step up my way to sing a little bit but but we're just not we're just not a church you know where / small church I said we're not a big denominational church I'm not trying to hinder God look you no doubt that God you've got to bring whoever you want sir wouldn't even got saved but that got a lot of people I didn't know that it was happening god I can bring a lot of people but the point is we don't stand out there you know like a denomination to have huge buildings and advertise on the TV you know we don't we don't have money like that we don't have it programs like that every other man who said stay humble you said don't don't rely on money don't get like that don't get a spot where you don't rely upon money for the ministry into the spot where you rely upon the holy ghost hey cauvery rely upon the move of the Holy Ghost of the church that's what we must rely upon that's why I'm rely upon this morning amen got to move in your hearts this morning so what proved did it this proved it right here numbers 23 9 they were all alone sometimes I feel sad when I'm alone when I read this I'm encouraged by loris that we're loving I'm encouraged because that's how it is really well she wasn't a ver out they were hate around the Moabites it tides they were trying to drive out those unbelieving hey hey they were trying to start a new revival amongst their move and the train up there showed remember if you driving six he said teacher children diligently the Word of God that things might go well with you in the land we're trying to establish churches within our families we're trying to Bruce riddle disciples of christ and believers hungry trying to get my god eater that was the command of God now don't get me wrong God can send an unbeliever some things like that but our strategy is not the same as the world the world's like bigger build a big church puts on it's all over the yard bring some people into Christ and those same he wiggly spiders that became in the neck they crawl out about two weeks later right I nose wiggle tails and all those snakes that they get them caught the net they eventually crawl right back out to the world how many see no I seen it so many times nine the comment under a special meeting and walk out and then deny the Word of God the very God they said it saved them they deny the word that's not the nine let's swallow with the Holy Spirit and let's let God after the church such as she said after the book of Acts head the box in the book of Acts God added to the church as many as four piece a day been that's a we'd have to wait for just wait for God will add to the church as many saints that are an acronym at all the free destined all the forward end of God will be at this church in acronym God's called them amen that's right so if you don't feel bad to be all alone sometimes church that's how easier once we're going to have fellowship with anybody universe you with the Baptist they're drinking their social drink or you know you remember her genetic also Christian missionary alliance I get FLC with em on a Saturday night let's go bowling let's go listen to like an old time rock and roll that kind of used it just pervert your soul nope is it up with the New York City they love that old time rock and roll it just perverts their soul what is it is trying to be a feast is trying to be like the doctor the family feast of a of your oh you don't fellowship enough with us or you don't hang out Noah sinners but you gotta be led by god to do that you gotta stay clean you got to heat your garments why they been remember Jesus told them jesus said I will only forgive you if you keep your garments white he said those who are worthy of me walk in white that's right I remember god forbid you to eat lunch with a fornicator god forbid you to look for something that won't work he said don't even eat with people that will work that they'll be a shame them stuff so the very fact you don't go to their movie theaters and their bowling parties and their birthday parties and their our anniversaries of all these things and all these things they do is or many things behind it the reason you don't go it shows a rebuke on them for their life of sin but where did you lower the Holy Spirit and the pillar of fire as lights in a dying art world amen see that they star has a written in your heart how many hearts as a resident the day Sarge to the rise we're children of the day not children on the dark as we said last Sunday amen make sure the children of life is headed on the pillar fire move over them uh oh yeah leading night and I filed by day oh I love you never God said this you don't come out from among them he said you come out from among them that I will dwell in you see God can tell people because they don't get saved and finds them they don't come out of the things of the world on their fellowship with their families and friends and comrades and all these things like that he said you come out I walk in you he said I'll be your God you'll be my people come out from among them be separate saith the Lord touch not the unclean thing and I'll receive you and I will be a father unto you ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the Lord Almighty ah how many grateful to be alone by following the Holy Spirit man on a new yo bro deficit I never do this let me show that close you said never knew it till till a few days ago now how many loves him with all your heart how many believes in with all your heart hope now do you think that I would stand here just because that we're not organizations that we're an organization would say those things you understand my brother why all my life I fought against that thing he start against denominations and creeds and organizations he said see it was the Holy Spirit that did that I couldn't understand it myself I did know it took just a few days ago see I did know what made me do that I didn't know why I always try to get some women living wrong and things I didn't know it what I do now because one of the doctor de balón do it produce an organization right it reduced people outside the word with false doctrines that led people to symbolize rather than a life of holiness but we're supposed to a perfect holiness in the fear of God Satan my said hey man he said they didn't know this took not showed me in the word that Israel is although they were just a fellowship all along Church in many ways the very people you see in here is all you got your fellowship you might say men men men how long can you fellowship with your denomination friends I can go about the and go little aha let's start feeling the file because they break out their short they break out their hula hoops they break out your paint they break out their dirty movies how how can we walk together except we be agreed so some of the most dear people to fellowship with all right here in this room hey ahead glad I'm still waiting for your invitations I can what were you how about it remember you're a sec necessarily dear speaker you ever want to meet that are all alone there caught out from the world all alone with the saints of God that's exactly right church let me thank God is calling us up now let's go a few more here little bit further am i doing on time ok see if you don't follow the truth is you think Nicolaitans that because God is doing for you do what you're doing like that there's original truth you're only taking God's permissive will see denominations are in the permissive will of God so limit the Holy Spirit say dodging on you this this is all God showed us and that's it he said you said well God give us the Holy Spirit he blesses us and we're baptized the name of our Holy Ghost you fail in mind see dr. Nabila look at that doesn't bring the power strainer but this is a prophet he's a modern-day Moses right brother Raiders of modern-day Moses comparing just a few baptisms nutty nothing else not smoking not cross dressing you'll not wear makeup um no the no other doctrines just that dr. of baptism and he said you'll take us and all that goes he said you bailin right all right that's up the church and I striking to see that see because that is a denominational thought don't get me wrong we love all of our friends what might be love everybody but we've got to stand with the truth praise God and we cannot be the sieve into All Star Trek we got to stay with the word of God so we gotta love at the same time yet denied their ungodliness praise God he said God did after he was so arrogant he just let him go on hung his own stuff that was bad enough ribbit basically got killed by Israel's army but man she just hung himself basically you got to get back to the truth foundational truth back to the Bible oh well he's blessed us he said I I know that he told Bailey to he said you go ahead if you want to you're bound to go that way and you want the organization route take it go Allah everybody see that by God's grace the doctrine of Balaam is a false unity that partially as a partial truth to it but not all the truth and it leads people into sin in this case and with sexual sin programs of and only has to lead you into spiritual fornication which is called doctrine amen dr. nicolaides I think I just have a few slides on this year no I got okay five seven or eight help me Jesus help me Lord Jesus are you joining us by God's grace and amen people say brother Ram you know we're not preaching both for a more rigid exactly what he said exactly what he said right back to the same scriptures and everything like that by God's grace all right now here's perhaps talk about the great guys seen council 325 I'm going to skip down here but but yet through the Nicolaitans the goal for most Constantine's political plan they outvoted the true church among the victory and issued it bishops and Holy Order men taking the holy spirit from the meeting and placing upon bishops Cardinals hopes and so forth okay so the council of nicea did some awful things now I read the Britannica this morning on the council of nicea and also did was praised it just pays Constantine crazy like you to some some great man well what is is a narrow down about trinity i was a conference that horse everybody should believe their way about the truth all right that's where my brother would condemn the council of nicea is so hard in 325 AD because it was trying to get all those who didn't believe the training the way we believe it get them out of church that's exactly what they did letraset did you notice in the catholic church today you can't read that by let's not for you to interpret that's the bishop see where it come from that he can see what they think Elena's really was a fart begin this we can crawl so by Madison look at a calyx today and you member for the Austin's bout as a Catholic right she was raised and they told her never read the Bible and so she hated go to church she uh she said I never understood anything they said it was all Latin he said memory used to always be glad their masses so nobody even understood what was saying it was total confusion babble and now recent within the last few years now they've allowed him to do it in English but it used to be just a lad so you didn't understand any Jews have with bloody fate just to believe what they're saying was right there's nothing just accepted okay and I'm shifting our friend stephanie was not a sister yet but hopefully she will be but she said that's how was my dad was raised in a Catholic school in Chicago church they never told read his body and so see the spirit now that says never read your Bible was the same spirit that comes with nice deal it has just advanced let me tell you Constantine then they read their Bibles but they were denying the parts of the Bible but now is the spot where they keep the Bible from the people to arrange your but if they read the Bible they pointed to the Apocrypha instead of the work of that right Jason right because the Apocrypha has those things like raise the dead in it all these kinds of false doctrines and Jesus turned a little clay birds and the birds and all kinds of different doctors like that and I've seen it it's not right so this we're seeing the advanced version of the doctor the Nicolaitans today now this is getting back to mail and that council and Constantine used the same strategy that failed did that a meeting after this counts up there the bishop put over the churches and somewhere to rule it and take all the power from the land team and they had no thinking of themselves neither did they have any rights to talk with the scripture and that it was all to the priests twisted interpretation of the scriptures finally after a while they make a master priest a vicar which was the Pope but now they come to the spot where they put it all the understanding belongs to the priest and the congregation's don't have to read the Bible they don't do nothing frankly the Bible's kept from them and now they've taken it all over upon themselves and was voted into us because it looked good and then brother Graham preaches a few paragraphs on it looked good to the Romans because now this Catholic Church wasn't called accountant or jevon they had riches big buildings wrote choir robes and fanciness how got two things so the Christians that weren't true Christians easily swelled up because of what money big buildings the outside appearance instead of what was in the heart praise God that should be the difference with our church it's not about the outward appearance it's about the heart amen it's about what is the truth what is what the real word of God say but see this will cause people to fall away bigger churches more money big rose big wires all worship is much better than all these things like this instead of the incense of the Holy Spirit are sensitive to the flesh and the Bible said to be sensual not having the Holy Spirit of a book of Jude when we make decisions by our flesh that's not the Holy Spirit you must make decisions by the Holy Spirit it always point you to the Word of God now almost of the history just bear with me just a minute one more quote don't get the history that will try to get to those rewards I got about 20 minutes so I God's grace now the work heard of most means Mary the very word peugeot speeds Mary Christianity that is that a nickel laid inside the formal side married to the state will go through the history of Copsey just briefly like I said I don't have time to read all of his instrument read over so Constantine married the state the government to the church and that is all true from history that's fully true with pagan ceremonies pagan ceremonies and it was the birth of the Catholic Church in that day see I didn't almost birthday kind of church because it's damaged of the Trinity they still attorney docket is so sprinkling you saw all these false doctrines and you can go read the council and I see the history that's what it was all about not in three persons kicking out anybody's going to agree with attorney doctrine we're kicking you out to see exactly how we see it or you're not a part of the church that's exactly what happened now anyone knows the Catholic Church has brought assistance at the Nicene Council here's a history this is the first paragraph on Constantine on the Britannica that's my go-to it's my go-to resource now jeez it's so easy it's right on line I could just do a word search it's real easy Constantine he says ah it says the first Roman Emperor to profess Christianity that doesn't mean he was a Christian he professed it he not only initiated the evolution of the empire into a Christian state but also provided the impulse for a distinctly Christian culture that prepared the way for the growth of the eyes inclined in western medieval culture now let's see this year look at this history says Constantine's that here it's the Christianity now remember was the false Christianity was closely associated with his rise of problem in other words he wintered did not rise the power except through Christmas Christianity his association with false Christianity he fought the Battle of Milvian bridge in the name of the Christian God having received instructions in a dream to paint the Christian monogram on his troops shields this is the account given by the Christian apologists lack 10 TS think i'm staying on the right a somewhat different version offered by use of us tells of a vision seen by constantine during the campaign against Maxentius in which the christian side appeared the scatter the legend in this side conquer howdy her down before and if you would admit of our demo so there's three different versions of how Constantine actually be supposedly became a Christian the first one he saw a dream the second one he saw a vision of a cross and the third one is says he didn't even see a Christian God it was the vision of a Palo off Scott see there's three versions of his conversion that's not a good sign two of them saying was he saw Christian cross a third one saw said he saw a vision of Apollo this Greek god at a shrine in Gaul so it's possible to put that up it's possible the very mission they say he had wasn't even Christ it was a false spirit it was a demon spirit disguises Apollo who showed him a cross and he said partner in this side wouldn't that make sense if that was what really happened would that make sense how I showed you history few years ago remember so we don't members maybe sister bowood many might remember i showed you in history from Constantine Constantine just foot crosses on the pagan temples he just put a cross up there but it was still pagan temple and had the same pagan rituals in it the same pagan statues he just went across it in front of it and that's as bad as putting up a message book here at the pulpit say we're a message church but we don't receive the spirit of the message praise God we gotta have the sphere of the message amen which is the holy spirit see this so there's three accounts on his conversion no court my brother Graham said this one makes the most sense I program did say they painted on crosses on their shields but I did say that so the kind of overlaps a little bit now here's here's the constant I see a Constantine second involvement and Italy's acid issue father defeat of the Sidious but the controversy over aranea ism with its intricate expirations of the precise nature of the Trinity that were concerned if Republican Greek was as remote from Constantine's educational background as was from his impatient urgent temperamental look at this is how you to describe st. Paul impatient this is how you described by the RAM impatient and temperamental he was a tyrant church he's a tyrant he was a techie wasn't it wasn't elected he was a tired he later killed his son will show the next one to see the Council of Nicaea it was a battle over his chew it I'm sorry his Christian priests and this group called Arianism which to summarize it they believe God created Jesus and he's like no God was a the Sun is the Sun is God too he's uncreated see member that number that doctrine of the Trinity God the Father uncreated God the Son uncreated holy spear uncrated his false doctrine I see this now I'm not saying Iranian as it was all right too but how many know Jesus body was conceded the Holy Ghost was the spirit of Jesus created no was the body of Jesus created you better believe it you see but to take to take old si there to cut out anything that disagreed with their Trinity and you disagree with their Creed may cut it out and wrote answer this is the doctrine of the Nicolaitans that's right see so there's truth in this I'm not saying it was all true cuz when I study in the past I don't remember being all true but it's true God had to be critical body of Jesus but the sphere that was in Jesus was God himself in the head that's right here's where he murdered at the end of his life so he can't say this guy was even converted because the Bible said no murder has what eternal life Wellington him haha ah mid aan de proves it no murderer has eternal life going in there he's God I'm going to do that's the word of God so see this is at the end of his life here the history says he visit West the west part of his empire in 326 to repeat the celebrations at Rome the anniversary of him being the ruler from the greatest political crisis of the rain during his absence from ease and meriva that remain obscure so you don't even know why did this Constantine had his eldest son Crispus slain look at that and his own wife my goodness foster Christmas stepmother slain he killed two people now if you read the history he was just great Christian man and brother branham brings it the other way he said IVs I can't find lunch tray that even says he was a believer the other hide the truth from the textbook see me there only telling the history through their eyes I'm glad God tells history through these eyes right here and Jesus told us the history of the church by those seven letters the seven Gentile churches hey man I believe you praise god for telling us what would happen the Peugeot most age where church and state would unite and they would start killing everyone that disagrees them exactly right you don't know Lord today never around Warren of the Holy Ghost to teach the people these things what are we saying church let me say this again just to remind you you and I he kept denominator as anything else as soon as you know at the Holy Ghost move in your life you start going towards that as soon as you stop trying to go closer to Christ you start getting a denominational spirit we nobody can teach me anything anymore I don't need to press into the things of God I don't need to search deeper for more of God I'm just comfortable where I am that's very very close to denominational spirit because now you organized in your own life and in your own heart mind you've already brought your own crees well this is where you stop you get to 36 Nick and stuff I'm 36 i'm using myself as their bed once you get to 36 then you can stop you off the bass afraid of the trap but pressing up to listen to tapes anymore over study the word anymore like after but jesus said if you want to hear from me jesus said is going to hear for me see me jesus said if you want to hear from me not come on to me the chipset and the Holy Ghost will guide you up there's a more truth you see some people might take the services over a Jessica no doctor to faylene doctor to think elated that's so far off weird work where the bride are you if you're the bride that we love the things of God amen then we remaining the truth and we keep the Word of God we keep hungry for more of God's look a supposed to convert a person by history turns into a murderer murders is a wife and a step such as old as time murders it I'm sorry stepmother his eldest son and then his stepmother money is this awful church and this is what history says is a real example of christina novelli girl he did some nice things he took away all the persecution for most Christians he said I cannot persecute Christians he does nice things there but when it come down to it this is what is nice what is the last things record on history by his life he kill other people yeah and one of the Antichrist spirited man to it from white to black I'm sorry white to red the black rope I look at the end of his life what does it produce death what do we have is a hip slide death what's the pair or greater spiritual death they were to see that let me just me just a little bit further here let me do the reward here now I'll try to close nobody okay I got a great season all right ease it out of the year let him hear what the school said the church's tended overcometh my gift e to the hidden manna give them a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it I never understood this till recently studied this week so I want to go to bring it to you so what's your reward sure remember you get this for war to not only did the program Oh safe this you get a tooth why because you're fighting those same demons that were there are most but now they're just advanced in taleo to see and emails are going to be church we get the same reward if I was in Revelation 21 he's an overcometh shall inherit all things hey Laurie so what's the hidden manna brother Hammerson let's give the interpretation what is hidden manna tight it was a type that a man that was kept in the holy place the show Greg is the Bible that was only for the priests how he knows that they had bread / congregation there's a special bread for the priests is that right so what was the reward they got special bread that nobody else got to eat I did it I got this remind me at first angle so the free save him gave David hallowed bread for there was no bread there but the showbread that was taken prep before the Lord to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away amen so see David was even a priest but God allowed him to eat the shewbread coming member that but the Bible said you and I are kings and priests unto God hey so got a lot of David to take partake of that that hidden manna hidden read and the Bible said you and I are already kings of Greece and we get to eat the special bread of God how many thankful for the fresh bread of God today ahead hallelujah I would go to my Pentecostal church I was racing or my Presbyterian Church I went to a college you get a hold that bird a stale rowdy piece of bread I got fresh hot bread they started a day Jesus Christ never changes his tears still bleeding into righteousness a minute it's hot bread is fresh bread is that old stale bread it's the real bread of God that's right larissa gotta stretch of red in a Nevada and what is our mana it's christ jesus said I am the bread of life that come down from heaven the man so the holy spirit is giving us the word of God amen and that's our Madison I was thankful for the man what was the hit man he said man isn't given to all the congregation he's not giving everybody the revelation is poured out upon the aims of the church the revelations of world seat of the word I'm sorry revelation of the word is given to the angel that age it's hid from everywhere and revealed that in mana its address the age of the church and you get it it's a little bigger revelation of what Christ is maybe a little higher calling I'm going to get dressed oh so to show you a divan if you're a kingdom priest today and legacy of obey you get a little bigger revelation about Christ and your calling is a little higher than everybody else's hey we're called for them a little higher all is go to the eat of the shewbread just the pre state of that bread they have their own bread out there but the priest got a special bread we have a special friend of snorting church let's see started amen let's enjoy it by God's grace in vinegar revelation a higher calling in Christ at other people hey bad hope that means something to you church mine we found out he also got hidden manna height of a show bread is especially made for the priests the leaders and this man overcome the whole congregation got mana but he got a special revelation of who Jesus was and what about him all about it t he got that revelation you overcome to the energy glory we know more about Jesus how he likes his baptism how he likes the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen how he like search services hi likes worship how he likes gifts how do you what he feels about prophecy we know all about the mind of Christ don't you like the mind of Christ a day we know a little more a little bigger revelation a little higher calling in Christ and everybody else that's the reward to an overcomer he lives up the hidden and Lauren hey man everybody else you'll get live and said all these things like that but you're called to live higher cuz supposed to have a better night

is always fresh if you're hungry to eat Great Satan ahem it's always there won't be sailed as long as the light is in the holy place the Holy Spirit shiny and won't be snail because God keeps it fresh for you and I hey man lastly my brother saved my finger on the clothes are you up here by God's grace on your feet so what's the in amana is the special revelation of Christ you and I get to know Christ and eat on the word of Christ in a more hallowed way than other people other people can't enjoy this freedom in preaching amen we can't enjoy it I can't enjoy free to the freaking ever though the people would walk out let's find a little walk out let me eat this spread all over yourself i'm not a denomination hey I'm now I'll just although with price it's just me and Christ amen oh I'm not advocating people even but you understand I'm not advocating be alone all the time but when it comes down to it there's going to be less and less sake I mean no that's the sort of death less and less not more and more people safe the Bible said Jesus has the short at a time that someone like would be sent all the elect will be saved now what is white white Ruff representing a bands to this angel of a white stone what is the ride he said purity later the next night he says it in the factory she said it means God's own righteousness so you're giving hidden man up and you're given a white stone and the stone represents a revelation we know that my soap is upon this rock I will build my church so you have a revelation of God's righteousness and a new name so let me just say like this you were supposed to receive a revelation by be the message a revelation that you have a new name what's our new name mrs. Lord Jesus Christ what are you then a nude in a church we're supposed to receive a new day know that goes beyond that you remember you must know you're the bride of Christ but it goes beyond that the great up said he knows who he is but he can't tell others because if the name which he himself knows but nobody else knows see no one knows but himself jesus said Peter know knew he had the keys of the kingdom but you didn't hear him bragging about it raised up he said these guys have brag and say well I've got a new name he said I noticed how many know that we have a rapture mr. Peter had the keys to the kingdom we got the revelation for the rapture but we don't go around bragging on why because we've got a special white stone and our names in there and nobody knows it except does no ma'am not let me explain a lot more by Madison the reason jesus said a white stone is because in the Peruvian age that's when they start building a white rock altered for their posts history can show you that to look at their artwork they still have up now okay you can see if there's granite and marble everywhere white beautiful rocks that's when it started was in the program age so jesus said don't look at those white marble stones I'm giving you a white spiritual stuff hey then I'm going to give you a revelation of your name and nobody else knows your name with you the man said but this angel or know who he was a son of God through the revelation of Jesus Christ are you starting to see this now the white stone is your personal revelation for the Jose of moody Walker let me say this my revelation is who i am i have a preacher of the true gospel of jesus christ i had filled with the Holy Ghost I am a continuation of the book of Acts but I don't go around bragging it's a revelation to me and I just keep it a secret it's something gods revealed to me you can't have the same stone as me right you can't I can't make yourself you can't take my son we all got our position in crisis you understand that that's what he's saying here Christ gives you a revelation of who you are I got a little higher this Robbie I eat a special diet I have special bread I can receive special preaching special word of god and i also have a new name which nobody knows i can't go around and brag about it because real Christians of regular they just no man knows except yourself well Graham said every perfect overcomer who sees a new name in that way he said he said the church he said the Pope tries to copy cat say I'm pope john paul i'm peter pan collar all these things see they

programs does find out what your name has a bearing on in your life he said we don't go too far to numerology like let's say your name is something bad don't go too far on that but by their gave the example of Abraham saw Jacob oh all these name changes Peter and wrote asset your name has something new with your my day means I possess so I like that one that's at least in the Hebrew but you see
