a few prayer requests tonight by the grace of Lord I didn't have any written down trying to think of a few that we were praying for at home let's just keep our sister Connie and prayer she's still looking for a job I believe I'm trying to text her to update on that so I told her we pray for them by God's grace hopefully she's live streaming or bless you sister Connie any prayer requests Haven okay yep Christians grandfather and the open heart surgery I saw a post though like his heart was beating irregularly Justin said okay so let's pray for the medicines or God - dude got on her God will guide the doctors rather with the medicines there we can pray for Karen's travel for weekend praise the Lord will pray for that anyone else have a prayer request Karis all right let's pray for salvation of souls for friends let's just pray for my cousin had him dem align again as we saw him on Sunday just for total deliverance total deliverance he just been back and forth you know struggling with different things well the same thing but let's just pray this time it's a real victory like brother man preached from that time on you know that and I said that text on Monday morning I said you know Jesus said he told the demon to leave and never enter again and I told him I'm praying that for him amen I believe we've got the authority like we saw we don't have the power but we've got the authority through the blood of Jesus Christ yes he kept his word amen thank you Jesus raise god amen praise the Lord Amen hallelujah yes a little bit a little bit background there he had promised his wife right Jessica that he'd get baptized if he passed through fireman school was that right and he passed through all of it so God knows you know God knows and you know there's numerous people in the Bible that made vows to God right and when God to answer their prayer you got to keep your part so that's wonderful that proves to him that God is real and God heard his prayers amen may God continue may God add to that faith he's got faith may God add hurt you and build him up so you can receive the full promises of God beautiful also I put my brother Paul Smith he's my youngest brother he and I talked Saturday and there he just asked for wisdom you know he's in a certain position on the job and then he's got desires to you know do things for the Lord so I told him I said lift him up in a word prayer so that's the stuff my brother he does go to cam Church so let's just pray for him tonight any other requests tonight I think the Lord well I'm just so happy they're so happy God is so good God did a little I don't know if you knew but God did a little bit of a miracle a little healing on Sunday night sister who Oh was sick all all week and while we were singing he is here hallelujah there's a nice anointing in here on Sunday night and sister Naomi let out a scream in the spirit you remember that sister Naomi and at that moment did who would tell you she did okay Oh Adam told you okay praise the Lord at that moment the very moment our sister was screaming the spirit a warm wind came in I guess and struck sister hua and instantly she said Oliver pain vanished right there by the grace of Lord so we thank the Lord for that phrase doc thank you Jesus so we thank the Lord that the Russian mighty wind still comes in here right though comes amongst believers so I'm very thankful for that you know two years ago sister SIA said she heard angels singing in here last Sunday night holy wind came in here this is a great place to be wherever two or three are gathered there I am in the midst of them so we're thankful for that by the grace of God I decided share that that's encouraging you know to know that despite our failures you know and our our faults and our mistakes you know the Lord looks past that and he sees our needs so we're very very thankful for the Lord Jesus Christ and I told Malachi in the car said I said that's wonderful I said I've never felt a win before you know I'm glad I've never heard of angels before but I believe it's happening I have been healed in service I told Malachi I was preaching at the old place and my neck just seized up I couldn't move my neck and so I said let's close and word of Prayer didn't tell anybody just laid my hands as I prayed and I felt this warm sensation and it came upon my neck and I couldn't move it and all of a sudden it just started evaporating I just felt this warm Holy Spirit presence it's are evaporating and then all of a sudden I could feel I could move my neck and everything was good so I have felt that and the main thing to do is that we just want to feel God's presence however hover way we can however he allows us and so we're so thankful for God's mercy let's bow our heads here as we go into God's presence and take these knees before the Lord here Heavenly Father we love you today father so wonderful to hear these testimonies about Todd's baptism thank you lord I remember praying for him numerous years ago Lord God probably all the way back in 2013 Lord God maybe 2014 Thank You Lord can look back these five or six years later Oh God a merciful you are Lord God we thank you for that testimony thank you for that little miracle you did there for our sister given her a complete soundness Lord God thank you Lord Lord it's comforting to know Lord from time to time that your angels are here Lord God they're singing they're protecting us Lord God they're a hedge about us Lord against the demon powers that seek to take our life and hurt us we're so grateful Lord Jesus for the blood of Christ and all your benefits we will not forget your benefits so we thank you for the angels encamped about us we thank you Lord God for your in our prayers for

description majesty enthroned above [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] lord thank you lord all praise is due to that reason Lord let's take our Bibles here tonight by God's grace I like to go to Revelation chapter 12 I appreciate it to Wednesdays ago I like to finish that chapter tonight by God's grace oh one more thing I did ferm brother Brian Hawkins will be here with us on March 31st by God's grace oh I'll be preaching all the Sundays up until then by God's grace that gives me a one two three four Sundays in a row and well take a little break there on the 31st and just so you know as you're turning to Revelation 12 I did ask brother Brian if if it'd be okay if his son preached this the evening service so his sons 18 his name's David and he's been a real faithful little boy now he's a young man and he's been preaching for two or three years he just preaches they're at their home church but I like to give you know young ministers a chance to preach so just so you know that Sunday night you know I'd like to have a minister he probably nervous it's probably the first time he's preached outside of his home church but I wouldn't be preaching unless opportunity to preach that was brother Brooks you know so without that invite I probably wouldn't be here today so I'm very thankful for that and so I like to give young ministers a chance to preach it and just as you've noticed in years past I've allowed different ones to preach and maybe they don't preach after a while and that's okay because at least we gave them a chance to see if that was God's will for their life and I still have not ordained any preacher that said under me to be a preacher because I just haven't felt led to the Lord to do that I was waiting to see different gifts if they would manifest and then certain things happen you know and you know maybe leaving the church or something like that and and so I just tried to be led of the Lord to do that I the Bible says not lay no I'm sorry lay hands suddenly on no man the Bible says so I want to wait and give that a person an opportunity to see if they're called of God to preach and if I've seen a gift in someone's life and they were sitting under my ministry I would certainly ordain that but if I'm not sure I just got to wait on it and see what God allows I feel like if there's a gift in that person's life then they will live they will live that word fully and brother Branham gives us a three-fold evidence in the church age book about preachers they have to follow that pattern and so that's how I do it here at this church I have an ordained anybody but that you know that that's how I do it by God's grace so maybe that'll clear up some of your questions from the past so Revelation chapter 12 verse 1 now usually don't wear dark colors like red but today was wear red day at work you know so I had to wear red yes I like to wear more plain colors like you know blue or white or yellow or something like and as you look like wearing bright red but you know well okay I'll wear the red if they want me over but it does remind me of the red blood of Christ or the scarlet token like scarlet cord already have hung out of the house so Revelation 12 verse 1 for there say Amen let's read verses 1 and 2 we'll all read verse 1 and then I'll read to by myself so let's read verse 1 on three one two three and there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the Sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars and I'll read verse two and she being with child cried travailing in birth and pained to be delivered that's about heads forward of prayer if you have anything on your heart just make an order to God here tonight Heavenly Father my hands are up Lord and father I've certainly have needs here tonight Lord and and father I'm so thankful again for these testimonies of Todd and sister who are Lord it just means so much to me Lord and Lord I just believe these are like signposts Lord showing us we're on the right path to your God and we're so thankful for that Lord you give us those so so we know we're not wandering in darkness or we're not off the beaten path we're not walking the permissive wheel we're walking in the perfect will of God so I thank you for that Lord as I know your prophet prayed and trying to go out of service your prophet pray Lord and every now and then just gives us signs Lord to know that we're still walking with you Lord so I have that same prayer Lord God thank you for those signs that you give us and father I know you're here tonight Lord God you promised to be and father Lord just take break it to our hearts encourage us strengthen us speak to our lives and father will give you all the glory in Jesus Christ's name in the church sent a man god bless you to being seated praise the Lord so we like to look at chapter 12 again I was going to look up that quote if I could find it real quick and I do have some dear Lydia oh yeah here just thank the Lord I found it okay so this is at the end of trying to do God a service brother branham said father he said keep us in these your hands they are yours I pray God that will always walk humble before you we don't know how long do we we make a little bigger I guess the wider we don't know how long we don't desire to know how long it's not our business that's your business it's not our wills to know when you will come it's are we Lord to keep humble till you do come and walk with you it's our desire now look how humble this is this is always stuck with me since I came in the message it's our desire for you to just let yourself be known once in a while father among us that we can see that we're still walking with you in that beautiful you know if sometimes if we're not careful we get discouraged if we don't see a like I know I do sometimes I get discouraged if I don't see a miracle from time to time I told her that a minute I said brother hey man you keep sticking around you hang around this message long enough you're gonna see a miracle and what do you see on Sunday night he finally saw America I told him I said you hang around this word long enough you're gonna see miracles I could retina saw her America amen so she probably had more than that you know but the thing is you just stay faithful to God every once in a while he'll show up to let you know you're still walking the right path oh thank you lord so let's look at a few quotes here I have so a few quotes like to look at this thought here pardon me I want to just real quickly review what we covered two weeks ago and then finish up this chapter Lord willing Lord willing so this is part 90 hard to believe 90 sermons remember brother Branham calls us a little heaven he said memorize gone through this quote on numerous times but I just want to remind you this is what mode random wish he could do wish we had about four till January to March or April to put a big canvas back here draw out the pictures drop the whole chart just raise them up and down window shades like I've always dreamed of having a big tabernacle somewhere where I could reach down and pull this chart down come all the way across the platform and revelations and the interpretations Lord has given me and take a pointer and start through there and bring these ages down then when we get through with that raise the one up hold the other one down like this and start on that and teach it through oh that would just be like a little heaven wouldn't it just sit complete winter through just sit I sit it out with our Lord glad to sit it out with the Lord tonight remember Church when when when the pillar of fire came down and made the seven shadows of the church ages across the wall all the awesome Rama doing was preaching on the throne guards of Revelation chapter four it wasn't a wasn't a sermon that even said thus saith the Lord and he was just teaching on the revelations that the Holy Spirit gave him after the church age sermons a few weeks after that and and the Holy Spirit showed those shadows or the lights rather he sold the showed those seven shadows on the back if you if I was at the pulpit of Branham Tabernacle they showed us is the back left corner so that that's where the the nursery used to be and so the man showed me and I asked him I said he pointed out right there is the back left-hand corner so for us to be like hanging right over where Lydia was if you like right back there that's where the Holy Spirit showed the light and the shadows when brother Anne was preaching after you got done preaching the Church ages and this was that exact quote I used to play the audio I had the audio but couldn't find it he said how many six in the room looked this way now he said now that's just like it is when it comes under glory now at this point remember they're all screaming and shouting I played it for you numerous times he says that's just like it is when it comes in glory here see it's the light over here you're moving here you see now look it's just it's just a reflection just a reflection that's that is see it's not the light here's the light hang in here right here see right here at this woman I just happen to catch it I thought it was over somebody now you're seeing one of them and I'm seeing two so the people saw the light in the back what brother branham sees the light up here too so they're seeing the natural light and brother branham is seeing the pillar of fire light amen he said you're seeing one I'm seeing two Cory one of them is natural the other one is supernatural there's a man sitting on the outside here along this line looking over towards that light it struck him he's from Seymour Indiana he had a stroke I believe sir God will give you that stroke amen believe now do you believe with all your heart you're not wonderful to know that on Sunday night the Holts with same holy spirit swept down in here and healed our sister and that great to know now it doesn't matter to me whether he sweeps in here like a wind or whether he appears as a pillar of fire or he speaks in tongues and prophesies doesn't matter as long as he's here amen now let's look at chapter 12 again now well remember said revelation 12 does not pertain to the bride this has nothing to do with the bride he says is the woman standing in the Sun with the moon under feet the moon represented the law the woman represented Israel the church and the twelve stars in her forehead was those twelve apostles 12 Church ages and so forth which was just passed and the Sun was at her head which you see that moon is a shadow of the Sun which the law was a shadow of good things that come and that woman is Israel not the bride and here's that great quote where it explains how what the moon means and look the moon under her the Sun at her head the moon under her feet the Sun was a dispensation of grace the moon was the dispensation of law the woman was the Orthodox Church the Jewish church and was standing over the law the law was passing away because the law was a shadow of good things to come is that right the moon is only a shadow of the Sun reflecting in the moon making the moon and the law was under feet she doesn't live through that day and notice how she was dressed here all right now let's read in our Bible and I'll try to catch up where we left off here yeah we left off member we left off with the rod of I remember that and I was wondering did I say that wrong was I wrong on that but no the Jesus says he he will give overcomers a rod of iron that's right in the Millenium because they'll be ruling over cities they'll be ruling over peoples they'll be ruling over a whole worldwide group of people and think about how many people will be born during the Millennium I don't know where those people come from do they make it over somehow through the Armageddon battle and through the I don't know or is God gonna give people another chance that live that never had a chance to hear Christ we don't know but the Bible said there will be children born and a child will lead a lie and I believe it for not mistake it was a lion a child will lead a lion or and the Bible said there'll be no sin for a thousand years remember that what's striking is that at the end of the thousand years this is striking to me at the other Satan is loosed for a little season and he deceives all those on the earth and can you imagine that that these people that live here for a thousand years they watch these righteous sons and daughters of God amen that's you and I praise God they watch these rulers rule with the rod of iron and around around the earth rule over cities and the watch sees a Holy Ghost filled a glorified body Saints rule and then somehow after a thousand years Satan will deceive them to come against us at Jerusalem can you imagine that that's striking you ever thought about that it just goes to show without the Holy Ghost you can meet a sea very quickly by Satan without I mean they would they would have a thousand years of testimonies are saying well ruler Aaron did this good this good disc it you hate you're never gonna sin for a thousand years you're gonna have quite a testimony praise the Lord you have quite a list of accomplishments right like the president can say well he's had these accomplishments on Wall Street and he could have a list of accomplishments right but in there are some mistakes too because we're a fall but not in the Millennium amen the Holy Ghost receipts will have no mistakes in the Millennium amen it only be a list a real long list of great decisions for a thousand years and think at the end of all that they'll still be deceived against you and I but that's where the Bible says that we'll have the rod of iron that's where the Bible said that God will come and rescue us amen although Jerusalem will be encompassed by this big group God will send down fire and fire will destroy our enemies amen the same things true today the word is like a fire that destroys our enemies amen hallelujah the Bible said there'll be a wall of fire around us what is it it's God always protecting his bride amen oh thank the Lord what a what a wonderful blessing not so we left off at verse 5 I believe now let me just read verse 1 and 2 again there Peter great wonder in heaven a woman that's the Orthodox Jewish Church right before Christ was born clothed with the Sun and he said that was the grace that was the the covenant of grace amen and that scripture because Jesus when he appeared transformed the Bible said his righteousness shone like the Sun and the Bible said Jesus was full of grace and truth amen haha full of grace that light a sunlight of grace God's grace and the moon the law was under her feet so she was that was passing away it's under her feet she's about ready to pass given the opportunity to pass in the greats and upon her head was a crowd twelve stars twelve representing the 12 tribes of Israel and she being with child cried speaking of Christ Christ came out of the lineage of David right out of the the Orthodox people travailing in birth and pained to be delivered verse three and there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great sir lost much man a great red dragon Satan having seven heads those seven hills yeahright the seven hills of Rome and the ten horns and then ten horns member of the ten tyrants or dictators are going to rise up for the woman with the woman rather in the tribulation and seven Crown's upon his heads and his tail drew the third part of the stars the heavens that gives us a clue that a third of the Angels were to see by Satan now think about that church what is a third of infinity because the Bible said there's an innumerable number of angels now I'm just throwing that out there that's kind of an interesting thought isn't it about said there's innumerable ange so it's you can't number that they're so great but a third of this innumerable number followed Satan so there must be some number there just must be innumerable to you and I that's what it must be I'd imagine all right No so now verse that's first four and did cast them to the earth so now these demons are cast to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child Jesus as soon as it was born right so all those demon powers were on the earth remember they got cast out of heaven remember that strike it isn't that striking about Lucifer and his angels it's striking because they were living in heaven but they get cast out of heaven but they're then they're allowed to come back there and argue with God about who's holy and who's just right like job in that striking so that shows that they're home they're no longer allowed to dwell there but they aren't allowed to come back to a heavenly courtroom oh aren't you glad that when Satan's they're accusing you before the throne of God aren't you glad you have a lawyer there praise the Lord aren't you glad you've got an advocate there with the father hallelujah amen Jesus Christ the righteous amen and if you repent of your sins and trust in the blood then Jesus will tell him the same thing he told Satan was Satan was accusing Joshua the high priest he says the Lord rebuke you amen hi there yeah let's see we've got to get our sins under the blood we got to confess and say I'm sorry forgive me I prepared and then the Lord can say there's this nerves no evidence there it's forgiven I've forgiven it don't bring it up I rebuke you amen okay what a promise amen my what a courtroom that is when the judge gets rid of all the evidence amen that's the kind of courtroom I want to be hid where any evidence against me is put away under the brunt in Christ and it will never be found again amen there's no record of it there's no way he can pull up that evidence anymore oh thank you lord hallelujah right verse five all right now this is where we ended and she brought forth the man child that's Christ who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron he must have the major rod and we must have minor or maybe it's just figurative speech I don't know but he did say revelation 2 then the Thyatira church age he'll give you a rod of iron to the overcomer now and her child was caught up unto God to the throne so in this verse you have all of Jesus Christ life for thirty three and a half years or thirty three years rather so he's born he's crucified he resurrects and he's caught up to the throne of God amen that's all verse 5 what a striking verse now verse 6 now I think I have ok I'm in the wrong spot let me get the right spot on my notes here thank you for patience I'm on verse six here we are alright verse six now we know verse six now verse six now in verse six the fleeing of the woman is Israel fleeing into the wilderness and this represents that the Jews rejected their Messiah and were broken off from the life of Christ in the New Testament okay so it's reverse 6 and the woman fled into the wilderness where she had the place prepared for God aren't you can't you see God's mercy in this scripture although they reject his Messiah that he even brought through the mother trip she didn't bring it outside in the Gentiles he actually brought his own son the right way through the sea line of David he was sent to his own his own received not and even though they rejected him God still said I'll give you a place of grace amen hurry up praise God other words I'm not done with you I'll bring you back amen oh that's a place of grace where she has a place prepared of God so God prepared her a place of grace now we know where that place is it's under the altar of God it's the fish seal she has a place where she can wait and she can say Lord how long until you avenge our blood we were killed under Eichmann and Hitler all these 2000 years we've been killed God said I'm giving you a place not a place in hell not a place in purgatory I'm giving you a place under the altar amen oh that's amazing grace church amen a place of grace amen that's why I believe the foolish words you may have a similar place I just can't see how God program says she goes to the grave but he never said she went to hell so I believe if God had Grace on the blinded Jew that women could never receive Christ wouldn't receive Christ if God had grace on the blinded you I think God would have Grace on the foolish virgin now that's just that's just my thought he's got to have a place I believe of grace because where she had the place prepared of God that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days now we know that's three and a half years all right and that's the same amount of time as the Ministry of the two witnesses in Revelation 11 3 I'm going to read it and I'll give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days clothed in sackcloth praise God now that just kind of strikes me here I just read it in the Bible can everybody turn to Azra please that just struck me I read this this a couple of days ago maybe yesterday Ezra Nehemiah Esther so after Chronicles Kings Kings Chronicles and chronicles Ezra Nehemiah Esther okay okay so now chapter five Ezra chapter five that's right so the Bible said she'll be this woman will be fed three and a half years and over here Ezra the Bible says it shows what prophecy does so when God speaks a prophetic word over a real believer it stimulates them amen it's it's like food to their soul praise the Lord when God speaks a word and God gives a thus saith the Lord it's like energy it's like food it's like strength so the Bible said she'll be fed out there in the wilderness she'll be fed in her place for three and a half years and that's going to be fed through the two witnesses because look at as we Chapter five look what happens in verse 1 then the prophets Hagee I the prophet and Zechariah the son of I doe prophesied under the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel even unto him then rose up zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and Jeshua the son of josedech and began to build up the house of God which is at Jerusalem and with them were the prophets of God helping them amen that's a real prophet of God a prophet of God does not walk in and say the SEC and go take a vacation out the wilderness for ten years a real prophet of God preaches the word and then he stays with you to encourage you and help you in the way praise God a man is heading the gap he had that temptation I'll just prophesy and open the wilderness but God wouldn't let him because God told him you're not an Old Testament prophet you're a New Testament prophet amen see God was helping them now remember this doesn't seem like much of a scripture for church but if you study the history when I preach on this they had not worked on the the church for 16 years go back and reach after 4 and 5 they start building the foundation and then a law comes from the new king of Persia as a different King not Cyrus cyrus told him they could another King comes around says no stop because they're not going to pay they're not going to pay taxes and they're gonna demand customs and all these things and so they sit around scared for 16 years at the government right just like you and I probably would if we would have been there right I don't want anybody to hurt me I want to be arrested I always thrown in jail and all of a sudden under 16 years God anoints these two men and they stand up and say now saith the Lord finish the work finish the house of God it's thus saith the Lord and these men just all of a sudden they rise up amen that's what we need when we're down in this scourge we just need to hear the prophet of God say they'll say the Lord or maybe God will give you as I say at the Lord you and I need to hear thy sight the Lord and it'll raise us up amen if it raised them up under the Old Testament what's it gonna do to you and I under the New Testament a man right and then they start working with them they don't sit back and watch okay you guys do all the work we got the easy life now that's a lot of preachers that do that they'll say you do all the work I'm just gonna preach but we all need to labor for the kingdom of God everybody has a ministry everybody should be carrying a burden right everybody should be working for the kingdom of God that's right now there was one more in here but I read it my other Bible so at home this one at the church so let me see if I can find it all right well maybe I can't find that one but there was one more that said something about the power of this prophecy yeah I do apologize I thought I thought I could find it I thought I'd have it in here there's another one that says that just what the prophecy did to them it was such a stirring thing oh yeah I'm sorry there's chapter 6 verse 14 there this thank you for your patience sorry about that I appreciate your patience you know how many know that when brother Branham was first preaching his wife had to read all the scriptures because brother Ram couldn't read the Bible so people had to be very patient he'd say honey read the scripture then he say is that right do you do it do you live that word okay honey read the next one so thanks for your patience with me I appreciate it 6:14 and the elders of the Jews builded now listen and they prospered through the prophesying of Hagee I the prophet and Zechariah the son of a dome and they build it and finish it according to the commandment of God of Israel and according to the commandment of Cyrus and Daris and artaxerxes king of Persia amen hey ain't that the truth you and I have not withered because a brother has prophecy or got weaker we've prospered and we've got stronger amen hallelujah I've not got weaker spiritually since I heard brother brand in fact I've only got stronger since I've heard brother Branham preach a man because he was God's prophet back I was telling somebody that this week I said before I heard brother Graham I still chewed tobacco I still cussed I still smoked I was going to church I'm still watching too much sports and all these idols in my life because their preaching was was no power in it there was no life in it it was just dead letter but when I heard the voice of that prophet the first time I heard his voice I started bawling because I heard his life story why because it was something real there's a reality to it and within a matter of a year my addictions have been delivered because I was hearing the word for my day men I was an eagle gathered around the fresh carcass can I say like that amen where the carcass is the Eagles will be gathered you're in the right spot tonight gathered around the Word of God oh thank you to see what prophecy days it causes a real son of God to rise up amen a real daughter of God hearing the prophecy of God's prophet will raise you up it will prosper you it'll strengthen you and you'll finish what you started amen glory hallelujah now that's interesting I've never thought of this I just finished the book on Monday so now she's just got to get it ready and I got to the launch date so it's finished it's finished we're just waiting for the printing now I had 27 more and it's I to do on the Monday I think it was so 27 little things to fix and now it's finished thank the Lord so I what do i tribute that to the Lord Jesus Christ helping me to spread God's Word amen thank you lord well hallelujah thank the Lord now okay now let's go on your Bible back to Revelation 12 appreciate your patience I'm just gonna like relevance I'd like to go scripture by scripture just like to teach this to the church by God's grace I found it so beneficial you know George I just find this you know if I just meditate on the word things just start coming to me don't you find that the more you meditate on the word the more revelation comes and then on top of that the more you pray for Revelation the more revelation comes that's right David said I'll meditate all day long upon your commandments amen now verse seven seven eight nine now am I in my study of the word these verses go together seven eight nine okay so three dose and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven so God basically said I'm taking your real estate devil you don't have a place here you have no inheritance in heaven amen you know deserve a place in heaven right for what he did verse 9 and that Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him now isn't this striking this is why no theologian can ever understand the Bible without a prophet because look verses 1 and 2 are Jesus birth birth three and four Jesus birth verse five and six is Jesus birth death and resurrection and now seven eight-nine go all the way before that it's totally out of chronological order and the church said God because God loves to hide it from the eyes of the wise and prudent in their colleges and reveal it unto babes such as we learn on the Wednesday night gathering amen glory not my textbook but by revelation not my textbook but by the book hallelujah you understand so he now chronologically I finally said it right this goes above appear by chronological order so now God takes us back to the beginning and this is a revelation that just struck me this week - I was praying for more revelation the mystery of iniquity is talked about in the Bible Paul says it in 2nd Thessalonians chapter 2 but the mystery of iniquity is how Nick WA T start at the beginning and here it is at verse 7 8 and 9 where did a Nick when he start it started in heaven through the most beautiful most smart closest friend that God had brother Ram said it was his right-hand man to fellowship where - Nick WA T start the person closest to God now you might have an argument where both Michael and Lucifer were close to God and you and that might be right you know because the Bible said there two Archangels there's two right and and if with Moses's mercy-seat with the two angels there where the Moses get that it wasn't from his own mind the Bible said he got it from the pattern in heaven I'm just making the point one of God's closest friends looked at God and he got jealous and said I need a throne like that I'm gonna exalt myself above the right by the stars of God I'm gonna have a kingdom on the sides of the north you think you've been good enough just to watch God do it right wouldn't have been good enough just to say I can't do what this guy can do pray sir they praise God raised him but what good could have God must none of the church God must have been so humble he must have held back so much of his glory and power that Satan actually thought well I can have a throne like that - I can do that right so what do we find God is always hidden in humility hey man hallelujah God is so simple God is so humble he hides himself and he's always clothed in humility and when Jesus come on the earth he wasn't a fancy-looking guy pride in comas hair like I do hey hey the Bible said he had no beauty that we would desire him just a small 5 foot - man brother Branham says just a small man let it look like that just real small humble didn't tower over everybody not a muscle man just a humble I'm a man humble carpenter that's all he was God always hiding in simplicity but Satan cee so ve so so prideful he thinks well I can do that look how much greater than I am and he exalts himself above and because of that he starts the war so God must have been so humble that he thinks well I can actually defeat this side can you imagine that God must have been so humble that saying things were I just get some warriors I just get them if I can get recruit some troops I can be Michael I can beat all these angels huh me know that angels when they fight huh me no they fight but no one ever dies let me know that remember in Daniel chapter 10 when Daniels fasted for three weeks and the angel finally broke through what'd he say he said I was fighting the Prince of Persia for three weeks you thought you had a long fight you ever had been in a fight before yeah you know Taekwondo we spawn for three minutes that seems like a long fight but not really long compared to three weeks so for three weeks they must be wrestling the mouths of the wrestle and they're wrestling in the in the heavenly places and finally Michael comes and Michael grabs the Prince of Persia and kind of holds him off and so this angel can say all right I'm gonna go see Daniel I'll be right back but st. in the beginning said oh let's I don't know what I don't know if they have soul it's like the Chairman's with the flaming swords I don't know how they do it but they can attack and fight for weeks and weeks and weeks and still keep going but Satan thought I can win this war and Michael said no you can't at some point Michael said I'm throwing you I wonder if we took him by the back of his robe I want every threw him over the edge of the cliff of heaven you may kiss the Bible said they cast him out they didn't say mr. devil Oh would you mind leaving for a little bit mr. devil sir please that's not how God God says go God says the Lord rebuke thee get behind me Satan amen so one day Michael finally wrestling over in the corner said you're coming over her see you later can you imagine it but God alone and God sits back the whole time that's my angel boy he's just like me is that right God let them wrestle it out God let the Angels know what it's like to wrestle against the devil amen so that when one of us repents and gets the victory over Satan all those demons leave the Angels go to rejoice in heaven said hi brother Jesse's not a Christian and we know unselect overcome Satan we fought him too and Jesse got the victory just like we did amen angels care angels want to see us overcome all the guys do is caught on the scene by the name of Jesus Christ amen and then the Bible said we can cast him out glory just gotta remember which side wrote how many two reminders Lord just remind me which side I'm on remind me of the authority as brother camps remind me the authority that I have in Jesus Christ so it takes us all the way back to the beginning till they fast forward to 4000 years and then then they go back into time way before the earth was even founded well yeah yeah but then of course the earth we've been founded then he got thrown down and got cast down to earth at some point look at that striking far the war in heaven and the dragon fought Kate and they prevailed not neither was their place any more in heaven so see he's allowed to come to heaven but there's no resting place for him there I'm so glad that Jesus Christ said I'm going away to prepare a place for you amen that where I am you may there be also hallelujah I'm glad I've got a place in heaven and I know his name it's called the New Jerusalem amen amen but Satan he knows the place and that's one place he'll never take a step on amen there's a New Jerusalem ha ha amen because it was set up after he was kicked out and he'll never be a part of it amen Oh glory thank you lord thank goodness verse 9 then the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent which is called the devil now remember he's got he's got four names here right or four titles dragon serpent devil Satan I put that on Facebook not long ago I said if Father Son Holy Ghost is three persons then Satan's for put that on Facebook and they're sure not many people challenging me on that one there's maybe one or two but they don't able to challenge that one because what do you do you you can't you can't make a title a name right that's why this Bible has all the answers you can't argue with this Bible amen just takes the Holy Spirit of directors to all the answers okay but now now look which deceiveth the whole world now this is striking Satan right now is deceiving the entire world now this is stated in three more scriptures let's read them tonight because we got time I'm just but any time here let me do I do you want to said time without I don't you don't know where you got where myself out okay so let's go and your Bibles let's go to Revelation 13:7 we're gonna see this the Bible says that four times in Revelation that Satan deceives the whole earth that means he's got to deceive China we've said it before Russia Australia the United States Canada Satan has to deceive every single nation under heaven with this beast system with the image of the Beast the World Council of Churches and then the Roman Catholic Church Satan has to deceive all of them now verse seven and it was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all Kindred's tongues and nations to see their Satan's give them the Beast is given power over all them now the next one 14-8 revelation 14 8 if you got your Bible revelation 14 II and then found another angel saying Babylon has fallen is fallen that great city because she has made all nations even communist ones drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication so even communist communist nations are gonna fornicate with the mother harlot are you with me in that striking even his countries are gonna be perverted with Roman Catholic and her daughter's doctrine now next 18 3 revelation 18 3 do you like these scriptures you like going through like that I think it's beautiful I think it makes it even more clear and of course it gives you more revelation brother BAM said in the church age book the Holy Ghost will not change the revelation but he will give you more information on the same revelation look it up look up more information maybe I can show it to you you got a minute can I show to you well let's read this first to know Revelation imagine if you're here you got an extra minute or two I imagine but I just want to ask to be kind you know I want to at least hear one person say Amen revelation 18 3 look this for all nations Wow even when orth Korea right there meet with North Korea this week right even Iran Saudi Arabia all these nations that seem like although never agree with anything with the Western nations the Bible said all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through her abundance of her delicacies mine so the Roman Catholic Church must have influence over the economy because that's that's how they fornicate with her they allow her to into their country in order to get have the all the delicacies of her finances she must have control over that that's what the Word of God says in 1823 and the light of the candle shall shine no more at all in thee speaking of Rome and the voice of the bridegroom another bride shall be heard no more at all in thee for thy merchants were the great men of the earth for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived my every nation now some just struck me there I never thought of it before yes at this point Rome is never going to have the voice of the bride or the bridegroom in her you catch it but we got it in Akron we've got the voice of the bride and the bridegroom right here in accurate Amen I did yeah it just struck me I never thought about that they're going to get cut off no little broad voice no more word voice no more preaching no more Jesus vindicating no more Jesus promise on your healing then no more that but we've got it right here thanks be to God amen at the voice of the bride and the bridegroom is right here brother brand did say the bride has a voice and the voice is the same as the Prophet he said the bride the voice and the word I'll say the same thing let me pull it up so I can prove to you now we do the more information and then we'll do the voice of the bride the spirit and the bride say come see Bob Arum says this he said he can get a revelation and then add to it yeah as he did in the Garden of Eden when he promised the seed of the woman and then later designated that that seed had to come through Abraham and the later said would come by the same bloodlines and David but it was the same revelation it only gave people more information to help them receive and understand it but God's Word won't change amen see so with with Jesus's first coming God just kept giving me more information or he's going to bruise a serpent then it's all okay well he's going to be in the seed of Abraham then he's gonna be the seed of David and God just kept getting more and more revelation that's what God is doing with the rapture amen God has given us more and more word in order to prepare us for that great catching away hallelujah amen that's why these people that say only say what the tapes it only say that that's true to extent as long as you say the same revelation of what the tapes say but the Holy Spirit can give a new scripture brother Branham never preached and as long as it lines up with us that revelation all it is is more information for the bride of Jesus Christ amen that's right and that's the difference I agree with that but there's more to it than that that's right voice of the bride the spirit and the bride and the Prophet he said they all say come so it's not voice sorry spirit and the bride say come okay it's not doing the church age book yeah but the church age book is but both have said the spirit and the Prophet oh I'm doing an exact phrase that's the problem prophet and the bride spirit I'll say the same thing yeah so he says they that here brother branham in other words the seventh angel will be blessed and become part of that bride the last day aren't you glad hey man thank God for William Branham amen hallelujah because we heard him we can be part of the bride amen because Rebecca heard ELISA she could marry Isaac ha ha ha amen we get to marry Christ because we heard God's prophet brother oh thank you Lord amen thank you Jesus glory oh thank you lord he said the spear of the bride say come the corn of wheat the bride wheat that fell to the ground and I see have come back to the original word grain again praise God forever yes listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears the last age what he says from God the bride will say Amen the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they would say we have already been said in the word amen and the word never says to worship brother Branham the Lord never says to stop having preachers preach the gospel with me church so see the bride will only say what the prophet said which is only what the word says Amen so who really believes brother branham's the Prophet the bride the bride those who don't add to the prophets or the Bible's word with me I'm not upset I'm not attacking anybody you understand you understand what I'm saying listen listen the bride doesn't add to the the spirit and the bride say come they say the same thing and they're gonna say everything the Prophet said amen alright so that was fresh and it wasn't wasn't plan on sharing that one either but I just tried to be led to the Holy Spirit back tonight by God's grace okay now I go back to Revelation 12 all right so we did seven yeah versus seven eight nine yeah okay verses 10 and 12 now revelation 12 verses 10 and 12 well I'm just having a good old time sin I praise the Lord for having a good offer thank you lord I love this word my thank you Jesus such a privilege such a privilege all those years you know in denomination I just I had to go I had to go to church I never stood the Bible and now we can understand it and I don't have to say I think this is right we got thus saith the Lord it's right and not many people have that we're the one of the only few people that have thus saith the Lord thank you lord verse 10 11 and 12 go together yeah so I group the last the last part of this chapter I group it into these three verses and these five verses 13 14 15 16 17 yeah hey verse 10 and I heard of loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the Kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ and that's one can write on one Sunday right yeah for the accuse of our brother is cast down which accused them before our God day and night all right and that great that's a wonderful time that's that's about the time of the rapture right there when Satan ket's cast down and there's no more accusing there can't mean it accusing because now the Saints are glorified bodies there's no more sin amen no more accusations because there's no more mistakes no more bad attitudes no more slipping a lie just you know we look out of your mouth that you didn't need no more evil lustful thoughts or no more greedy no more angry thoughts you can't send any more because eternal life has swallowed up your mortal body amen Oh hallelujah amen thank you Jesus the Bible said he'll swallow up your vile body and they'll be transformed like Anna's glorious body amen thank you lord okay verse 11 and they overcome him by the blood of man by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto death if anybody wants to make a testimony video let me know I'll be happy to record you're doing a testimony I did one for Simon mike.mccluskey I did one for sister barb from cams Church and they're all in on Vimeo or Facebook or something like that or YouTube rather YouTube there's something powerful about giving your testimony I think you I think you understand right you got to have a testimony you have to show and declare how Jesus Christ has helped you pass the test because life is a big test remember the Bible said that that God sent His Word and tested Joseph yeah I go to Psalms 105 I just heard the scripture this week - yeah Psalms it's 105 I can't remember the verse but just I believe it's there my memory serves me correctly yep so I was one of the five it's now 17 he sent a man before them even Joseph who was sold for a servant yeah thank you lord verse 18 whose feet they hurt with fetters he was laid an iron remember that 11 years is part of her servant two years in prison verse 19 until the time that his word came glory the word of the Lord tried him oh thank you God God gave him the word when he had the vision all my brothers are gonna bow down to worship me glory to God I've got a bright future and what happened after that and like it's like his world was turned upside down see first God gives you the wail of prophecy God gets you really happy about what he's gonna do for you and then he tests you out to see if you really believe it the same thing was true for Abraham you're gonna be the father of Nations and 24 years later he's like we're gonna have a baby yeah Sarah's laughing yeah right God will speak prophecy for your life he'll tell you his plan and then he'll test you to see if you really believe that but he knows a true child of God will pass the test amen and so the whole time he's just like I've got a word I've got a word I've got a word but he was waiting to the word came to a fulfillment and that's all we're doing hey we've got wave upon wave and thus said to look on the bride and this and that all we're doing is being tried and tested God just wants to see that you really believe this is the Word of God amen and at the end of this the Word of God will try you the Word of God will come to you and you'll come forth the Bible said you'll come forth as I am a true believer I am an overcomer a man I do believe God's Word amen glory see you overcome by the word of your testimony Joseph didn't say all my life was so simple my life was so easy I had a dream my brother's gonna serve me and five days later everybody was serving me I got to eat meat every day and grapes and it was just a really easy life that wasn't his testimony No God showed him the great things planned for his life but it was only after great harsh trials think like that with everybody David said you're going to be king so Sanderson I'm anointing you your cups running over and you're gonna be king and then he had to run from Saul for 13 years chased out and the end of that 13 years where he said I'm no better than a dog he put himself than a dog and yet where's all the where's all the great emotion and whiz where's all the emotion from the giant killing see God had to test him gotta to really make sure you really believe that word church are you really sure you believe this is God's Word are you really sure if you're a child of God you'll pass the test you'll keep hanging on even when you don't feel like hanging on you'll keep believing you'll keep trusting and in due season God will manifest that word that word of promise will come to you later hallelujah every man of God every woman of God went through the same thing he first shows you this beautiful promise they says let's see if he believed that's what the devil said let's see if he believes and gods like he believes it she believes it oh she won't wait for 35 years you know she can't do that what do you think she is he thinks she has some some special kind of person and gods like yes she's very peculiar she's a peculiar treasure unto me she's an alien and a sojourner he's an alien he's a sojourner he's perfect because he's got a perfect sacrifice my own son the blood of jesus christ well how'd I get on that praise the Lord thank you Jesus you gotta have a testimony Church verse 12 therefore rejoice ye heavens and either draw on the earth woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil's come down unto you having great wrath because you know they have a short time so that is when Satan comes down for the Great Tribulation Period so see verses 10 11 and 12 have to be at the time of the rapture 10 is at the time of the rapture because there's no more accusing in heaven and then 11 11 is how they overcome before that and 12 is then Satan coming down I've only got a short season I can't accuse the Saints any more so I've got to do the most damage I possibly can all right everybody got that can anybody say man you got that okay let's move on let's try finish this I got a few more things I want to I'm sure verse 13 now the timing of all of this 13 to 17 is during the Tribulation Period and when the dragon saw the he was cast out under the earth he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child that's not the bride that's Israel because she's the one that brought forth Christ the man child and to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle that she might find a wilderness into her place see so the Bible even tells us when she goes to that place she goes that place at the time of the of the Great Tribulation she goes and hides in that place where she has her two prophets to feed her the Word of God and where she is nourished oh glory for a time now time is a year did you know that I've been studying on that little bit I'm gonna preach more on that a time is a year so she's there for a time and times x is two years so time times and a half time so three and a half years and that beautiful that's fresh to me that's been fresh God's has been opening these things up here time times and then half a time so what time are you in in your life that and that wonderful to think about that well what time is God doing right what is this guy gonna do this year in my life that's what we should all ask God right what are you gonna do in this time of my life because the time is a year remember to everything there's a time per person to season glory just blow it out hallelujah did you know there's 14 times and seasons and of please ask these three and they each have a matching and opposite effect there's a time to be born and a time to die that's one of them that's one there's fourteen matching pairs at church maybe God will show us which time or season word would not be beautiful to see that I know about you but I'd love to know exactly where I am with God weren't you by the brand new he knew was in the first poll right second poll third Pole I like to know exactly where I stand with God that's beautiful verse 15 and the serpent cast out of his mouth I know I don't know what this represents water as a flood I don't understand that I don't know if it's a natural flood or if it's like the armies coming against Israel I don't know as a flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood I know the Bible says when an enemy comes in like a flood I don't know if this is a because the description I don't know if this is a physical flood or just an army attack or some some evil attack look at verse 15 and the serpent cast out of his mouth a flood I'm sorry water there is water as a flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood and the earth opened up I'm sure help the woman and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the Dragon cast out of his mouth so a flood a water flood comes out of the the devil's mouth and tries to swallow him up so probably not natural rot water right but it's kind of hard to say and I haven't I've looked up quotes on that I haven't found many good quotes on that so I don't know exactly how brother Bram interpreted that one and verse 17 and the woman was Roth I'm sorry and the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed which keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ amen so see Church look look what happens Moses and Elijah nourish her for three and a half years and what are they doing they're teaching her about Jesus Christ because now she doesn't just have the testimony of the Word of God now she's got the testimony of the word and Jesus Christ ha ha amen thank you lord beautiful now let's close to this I just want to do a few things here I want to share a few things by God's grace brother Branham gave us thus saith the Lord on the church ages chapter one two three he gave us thus saith the Lord on the seven seals he says now see friends this is in the seventh seal in 1963 March 24th visions doesn't fail I talked about the vision of the seven angels in the cloud commissioning to preach the seven seals that's the vision he's talking about how you went out west they're always perfect they're exactly true now the vision plus the word plus the history plus the church ages and all them blend together so I could truly say the best of my understanding according the Word of God the vision and the revelation the interpretation thereof is thus saith the Lord so we have thus saith the Lord on those four chapters and then for next week Lord willing or maybe Sunday when I preach us we have thus saith the Lord for revelation 13 verses 16 17 and 18 so from my searching we have thus saith the Lord for at least four full chapters and then part of another actually I could have put 8 on there too because the 7th seal the 7 seals in chapter 8 and programs that's a day the unknown day an hour of Christ's coming all right so let's read that go revelation 13:16 18 you and I don't have to worry and wonder what is the mark of the beast is it a computer chip my brother ran like a man preaching about Rams day it's a pill you take and it makes you grow as big as a three-story building but a man said he he thought those guys were just they lost it you know they were crazy he said can you imagine he said a Holy Ghost field person believing that that's the mark of the beast they'll give you a pill and you grow three stories tall that church I don't know that man must have been trying to get money I don't know what he was trying to do must been trying to sell those pills or something I don't know what I mean there's nothing in scripture about that but we don't have to wonder is it a microchip is it a new ATM machine coming out its the confederation of churches thus saith the Lord look at verse 16 17 18 and he causes all both small rates we can have the Beast rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or and though to see it's not it's not it's one of the other and brother may have said it's either the right hand is the doing the will of the the the Confederation churches you do the works that they want you to do or you believe their doctrines the mark in the forehead that's what of em says and that no man might buy or sell save that he had the mark of the number of the beast of the number of his name here's wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for his a number of a man the Pope and his number is six hundred threescore and six I was preaching at the middle school on Tuesday morning and there was a in there but I was preaching the teenagers and I was preaching on the third parable mystery of Jesus Christ the grain of mustard seed and I said that grain a mustard seed could be faith but I said it's more likely like I preach it here but like brother said it's more likely that false church that got planted because of all the birds that that roost on it how many remember that because birds in the Bible always represent spirits and I said I said children or youth I said let me give you a warning there's a church out there that is a cage of unclean and hateful bird and a boy looked at me and said who is that church mr. Smith and I really wanted to tell him but I said well I don't feel like I should tell you I said you pray about it and God the reveal to you see right because the Bible said in James 1 if you ask for wisdom God will give it to you well little did I know after we all shake hands I give him starbursts and suckers as they go thanks for coming god bless you you know you take these divers the librarian comes up and said mr. Smith who is Mystery Babylon I thought well hallelujah she's an adult I can share with her so I lean real down no she's got cut hair and makeup on and I said it's the Roman Catholic Church and I'm expecting like to get like I was ready to get a little fight you know she's like oh yeah I believe that too I'm like glory I said hallelujah I said Roman Catholic Church now she said well but I think it might be something else and I said well friend I didn't call sister I said well friend I said the Bible said the mother harlot has daughters she was saying oh it's just it's not really a church it's more like a movement I said no it's a church it's the mother church I said look at all the abuse that's going out through her and I said all the daughters all the churches that hold her false doctrine so taught me a good lesson Church if you stand on the truth if you stay on the God's Word people are listening God's gonna send those predestinated souls to hear the truth of God now whether she ever comes back and asked anymore she's accountable now because Church how many believe that the rapture could be in this generation you do believe that I'm 38 the next generation forty years I'll be 78 is it possible the rapture could take place in my lifetime absolutely look at the rate it's going with homosexuality and abortion and transgender look at the rate and the Roman Catholic Church look at the rate it's going could it happen next generation it may and so what do we have to do we have to shine the light of God to a dark and dying world we have to be the voice of the bride and we have to let the voice of the bridegroom speak through us amen let me close my eye just loose on all track of time now I even told my wife tonight I said honey I'm gonna try to preach those shorter tonight she's like gotta laughing she's probably laughing enough now we have thus saith the Lord now let me close with this you can stand I just want to play this I had it all ready to go here it is we have thus saith the LORD I was listening to Billy Graham not that well I guess I did start that one yeah I would listen to a few different videos this week on the drive to church not drive to work listen them so here now this is the video though this is my video I made on the state the Lord future prophecies brother Branham let's hear brother man saying it for himself what the mark of the beast is how many like to do that [Music] God's prophet said that the mark of the beast religion in Christian denominations will take the mark of the beast no no no I don't know about you church but if we have family members and denominations we got to pray for them tonight they will take the mark of the beast thus saith the Lord brother Ram tells us the denominations are going to take the mark of the beast right I mean we have family in denominations I do we need to pray for our family denominations help them to come out come out of her and her daughter's my people it's thus saith the Lord did you know job said that job said let my words be engraved in a mountain of Steel did you know job said that but there's prophesy he's got the spirit of a prophet on him just like job did Hey yeah and I can say I don't know these words have been written on a mountain of Steel but I'll tell you this they've been written on the mountain of my heart and then they've been written on the fleshly tables of this heart by the Holy Spirit [Music] [Applause] 2364 [Music] [Music] anointed ones the entire stop right there church we got thus saith the Lord did not every denomination is gonna take its thus saith the Lord think about that as we pray here as we close we have thus saith the Lord on all these things we've got to be making ourselves ready now Church I want to close with this thought maokai coming up here as I share with that group their their church is a cage of unclean and hateful bird they abuse children their their lustful machines all the adulteries and Marian three four times in the churches the steel in the lion the backbiting the all the evils that they do the anger and bitterness all these things there are cage there are church full of demon powers the church we're a cage but there's only one bird here and he's not caged in and that's the dove of God and he flew in here on Sunday night to bring a healing to our dear sister Laurie amen but if said God will not back up a lie amen but brother what brother I'm preaching about brother can't preach about creating an atmosphere coming to the house of God believing God's Word being an anointed person coming here anointed hallelujah and letting God flow out through you I told Malik I said before him the first service I was praying God do signs wonders and miracles in this church today and God did a sign God did a miracle well I say miracle instantly it wasn't divine healing didn't take hours and months it was instant I'm glad that that dove will visit this church and Lord if it be your will just let that dove visit our church every now and then to let us know that we're still walking with Christ we don't want a bunch of hateful birds in here hating one another spirits flying disagree I hate that person I can't why do they go to another Church oh if I can only indulge more in the flesh I can only get all these things out of Tyre and live a more easy life pleasurable life we don't want those kind of birds flying around here shoo like abraham shoo get off the sacrifice get off the word get out of here let the dev calm a men how they look that furnace of fire step down in here between the pieces of

so that Dove can stay with us I don't want a flock of evil birds around here and you don't either we just want one sweet humble bird clean bird clean bird to be able to just love our church so much he could just kind of purse right here and everything that's preached he says that's right that's true no anger the preacher is not upset with somebody the preachers not preaching at people trying to make them feel bad but he's just trying to raise their faith he's trying to raise his own faith to believe every word that that dove says oh the Holy Spirit let's just pray together if you would ask the Lord to help us have such a atmosphere that the Dove can roost amongst us we know we can't cage him right we can't cage the Holy Spirit here we could grieve him and he could go we can't force him to stay but we will have such a holy life like little lambs gentle obedient perseverant at the Dove can dwell amongst us at all times Heavenly Father my hands are up Lord God thank you for your word
