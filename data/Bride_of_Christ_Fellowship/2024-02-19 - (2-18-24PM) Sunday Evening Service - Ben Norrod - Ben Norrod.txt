for all of the hospitality and um we uh we counted a privilege to be gathered here with you and uh certainly appreciate all of the kind fellowship and the nice words and all the prayers and the things you would offer for me and my family and keep us in prayer hold us before the Lord and uh oh I almost forgot to mention brother Jesse so coming up may God willing I'm getting everything prepared the trip I was supposed to take to ugana last year and I didn't get there because of the Visa I'm going to put that back in play for May we're working on May going up there maybe the third week or something around there so pray for us on that trip will you that the Lord hold us and uh you know I put that before you last year but um or even maybe toward the closing of the year before that cuz we're going to go in February I do believe it was I think it was either late January or sometime maybe second week of February I think is when we're supposed to go but they they give me this electronic visa and and I keep hearing from Brethren that they don't accept that when you get over to the border and that's the only thing that I can see that they're doing now so y'all pray that the Lord help me figure it out last thing I want to do is spend 30 hours on a plane get to the border and say go home and don't work so you know you pray for me the Lord helped me do it I I I I I don't want that to happen to me and uh used to be you could go right to the border and buy the Visa right there you know and they let you pay and go right on in but they've got things changed since Co and I'm not sure if it's just a uh thing with our embassies over here or what it is but anyways we'll we'll figure it out the Lord willing all right Genesis chapter 3 I'll look at verse four five and six I want to speak to you this evening upon stolen identity stolen identity and um this is the one I was referring to this morning and I've been trying all day long and yesterday to get away from this I thought well Lord I put this together special for the church at home but I keep feeling the Holy Spirit say no you didn't put that together for just home you're going to take it out here and use it on the field so here we are um beginning at verse four now if you're reading with me and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die for God doth know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil and the serpent when he tells her this notice he's working on the eyes the eyes will be wise when the woman saw that the tree was good for food that it was pleasant to the eyes and desired to make one wise a tree it'll make her wise she took of the fruit thereof and then did give to her husband and he ate as well so brother said she live with the serpent that morning produced Cain Live with Adam that evening possibly is the way it might have been and then uh that produced Abel two twins in the same womb two churches in the two Spirits rather in the framework of one Church same type being lived out here but notice the focus was upon the eyes the eyes was the thing now I want to read to you out of blind barus and if you'll just remain standing just one more moment and we're going to pray over the word and uh just just one statement here from Brother brandham your eye is the gate to your soul let's pray together father thank you Lord Jesus what a privilege Lord it is to come back into your house tonight Lord after the wonderful outpouring of your Holy Spirit this morning we are setting on the edge of our seed about what kind of seed you're going to plant in us after the ground all broken up now and our hearts ready for the planting of your word father take this message tonight and Lord you've seen I've struggled and wrestled trying to get away from it Lord because it just seems like a a thing Lord maybe not so much Evangelistic but you just keep compelling me go back to it and bring it and Lord I'm just going to follow you and Obey you tonight because I know you know what's best for all of us just help me I pray Lord to be able to deliver it in the way that you would desire to put it before the people tonight there be anything laying up here Lord that maybe my mind would go certain direction you just steer me right on the path and help me stay right where you want me to stay Lord then open the hearts of your children tonight the visible and the invisible audience the same Lord those that might get the message later and listen to it a different time May the same fresh Holy Spirit fall on each of them Lord just as it'll fall in here tonight and has been falling by thy Grace and we just pray you'll anoint me and the people together that we can receive from Thy word as we commit this to you now in the name of Jesus Christ and all of the needs of the people together in Jesus name and all the saints said amen you may be seated may the Lord bless you we so thank the Lord for all of his great things now if the Lord will help me I'm going to deal uh extensively with um just different things about uh you know there's a lot of young people sitting here tonight and young men and women of course that are sitting here just the same and uh young mothers and things like that and to my opinion this would be be a really really good message to be able to bring to the people of God in the way of understanding and giving understanding about where we're living at in a time of social media and all the little things that go around us and I think this would be a good evening to try to bring forth an understanding about how these affect us and I've got several things up here that's going to sound quite negative against social media but let me just put it this way you know by the help of the lord I can't come up here and say hi how good everything is and blessed and wonderful and you know and then you understand maybe the dangers of it but there aren't positive things and I think of brother Jesse back there tonight and to me he is a positive example of how to use social media properly he uses his YouTube for the witnessing and for the kingdom of God and you know I'm thankful for that brother Jesse and I was thinking on the way up here about what a blessing I spend to many many people and I've heard people mention things and talk and what more and that blessed me to hear that then of course you know if you have any dealings with the ways of the world in this day and age you got to have some kind of connection you know in school to some kind of page or some kind of a thing and then mothers and fathers you know they they get wrapped into this type of world where everything is based upon what's in that cell phone and based on what's in the highspeed area of life and there's a lot of things in there that quite honestly if we're not careful we're going to get caught up and it'll catch away all of our time and steal away all of our time and will even shape us and mold us and form us into the image of what we're looking at remember the Apostle Paul said that if I look into a glass dartling whatever image I'm looking at that's the image that I become and so whenever someone is taken time to look into the uh into you know into the face of their computer the screen of their computer into their phone or whatever it may be there's an image an identity that's being placed before the world and I think that what we're going to find in a little while as we come down to Daniel we're going to find that Satan wants to do everything he can to change the identity of Sons and Daughters of God look when he goes all the way back to the beginning and I'm going to Veer from these notes a little bit because I I keep trying to hang there and the holy spirit's pulling me away and I'm just going to follow that a little bit but I I I I think back to the very beginning amen when when they were first called Christians at Antioch and my thoughts go here that like in the Garden of Eden Eve wasn't even named Eve did you know that her name in the very beginning was Adam she had no identity other than Adam he was her head he was her flesh he was her bone he was everything that she would ever be Amen in feminist form and in name she was exactly the same thing but after the serpent got to her and brought deception to her he began to start a renaming or a reidentifying process when he stood right there in front of her and said but God knows the day you eat thereof will your eyes will be open and that when your eyes are open then you'll be able to see Good and Evil and you'll be able to know right from wrong and things of that nature and see God never intended for Humanity not in his perfect will anyways he never intended for Humanity to make make their own decisions and find their own ways and all of that he simply wanted them to be submissive to the word of God are you with me so far amen and follow what he said amen and then they would be protected behind a word Veil and that word Veil would protect them and shroud them and encase them all of the days that they had breath in their body and all of the time that they would spend in that garden now we know that Satan had to be working on this girl amen maybe for even thousands of years Satan looked for the right process and for the right moments and for the right workings and how everything might fit together no doubt he studied nature extensively to see exactly how nature operated and when he realized that nature was uh working by procreation amen then he begin to think to himself well why don't Adam and Eve bring forth and multiply the same way the squirrels and the dogs and the cats and the monkeys and all the these others bring forth and then it real then he dawned on him out at one point he realized maybe there's a reason why they're not doing it he went back and heard what God said about it you know and I'm just kind of putting this in the way of a drama just to kind of give you an example of it and he went back no doubt in his mind and he said all right God told them to multiply and replenish but he told them not to touch of a certain tree but as I watch this Animal Kingdom out here and I watch these bees buzzing around the flowers there must be something in humanity that is similar to this out here but God said don't you touch that lest you eat of it and you'll find death will strike the moment you do so Satan found a creature we know the serpent was upright like a man and he was as close as he could be in order to mix with the woman's egg in order to bring forth a child he had all of the ability to bring forth just like Adam did but he was handsome brother man said he was 10 feet tall no doubt he was a very good-look thing maybe when Satan moved on him he was a smooth talker you know what I'm talking about amen he knew all the right words to say and knew all the right things to say reminds me some of these last day Slicker preachers that get up here and they know how to Goose the crowd and grease the crowd and get everybody amen shouting and jumping CU they know how to say the right things amen they're not preaching the gospel and sewing word seed but they sure are easing things over telling everybody you're the bride you're the elect you're going in the Rapture not living like the devil you're not going in no Rapture amen you've got to be holy ghost filled saved and Sanctified amen and I believe that only that kind's going in the Rapture amen and the fact of the matter is amen the church just like organization became reidentified the very same way that Eve became reidentified after the fall now remember your eye is the gate to to your soul and she said she beheld the tree by her eye one desired and so forth amen and she took of the fruit thereof and gave to her husband that evening now the Bible said that Adam was not deceived do you believe that's the truth amen why he was directly a descendant from almighty God he came directly from the spoken word of God and she was formed as a byproduct and made and built with a weakness in her that she could fall now we know that God did it on purpose he manifested this thing on purpose so she could fall that the promise of God and all of the things that would happen amen down through the stream of time could happen just like they did and God was savior but nobody was lost in God was healer but nobody was sick in him was Redeemer but nobody was amen separated uh from the Commonwealth of the kingdom of God but through the fall amen through that reidentification of Eve amen sin struck the the world and now all that was in God can be expressed to you and I amen that makes me want to shout hallelujah don't it you amen and think about now how that the eye that's the thing that caught her was her eye same thing caught the children of Israel in the days of Saul when they kept looking around at all of them moabites and all those ites and things around them then great kingdoms with the King amen they had all kinds of wealth and everything in the world they begin to look with their eye and with their eye they begin to see we want to be like the rest of them we want a king just like the rest of them here come that little prophet Samuel amen with that gird laying over his shoulder he said I am your king amen and God Amen was rejected right there and what did the people do they didn't go out there and get that little humble David even though that's what the Horn of oil and the anointing drew the prophet too was that little humble David amen ready hanging around he's a mama's boy you see but what do the people look for they look for the tallest the best looking good to the eye desired to make one wise that's what man's always trying to do he's always trying to look for something bigger and greater please in the name of God please somebody tell me why we as message people in the last day are putting up 1920 and $30 million buildings all over the place amen getting bigger internet programs and getting better this and that and the other amen we're right at the eve of the coming of the lord we shouldn't be working according to the eye we should be working upon upon the need of the people now if someone needed a church like that God bless them may the Lord be with them but my God Amen are we preparing to pack up to get out of here or are we trying to find a home on this planet amen the ages coming to a close very quickly brother Ram uses this in marriage and divorce when he talks about the beauty of women he types the church with the woman and he said when do the women or the church to this day ever get any more beautiful with their big spires on the hill you know and all of the gold and the things that they have now at one time message people in them storefronts and them hokey broken down little country buildings they couldn't brag too much and boast too much about the status but we're 60 years past brother randam friends now these message churches just like the trend of the day they're getting more beautiful all the time amen getting bigger and and more you know more robust and every everybody trying to put out the best looking product amen that's what brother bam called a hybrid situation he said it might be a better looking product but ain't got no life in it amen God give me a storefront any day I'll take an old house meeting or college prayer meeting any day that's got the Holy Ghost in it than some of these great Machines of the last day amen and then God might be working in some of these things I'm not throwing off on them amen but why are we doing such great things the eye Satan once again working upon what we see and the eye and the characteristic of the day amen preachers get up they have to have you know a $400 silk tie on $400 alligator shoes amen a $200 alligator belt and a $1,000 suit amen I get my suits from GW Fashions that's Goodwill if you didn't know better amen amen or GM Fashions that's good Mama Fashions amen while I'm at it Hallelujah I don't go out there amen somebody asked me how do you survive as an evangelist nearly 21 years I said I don't go to these great big stores the Brooks Brothers of the world Amen and buy them brand new off the rack amen nothing against that amen but to live like I've got to live I have to make a sacrifice for the kingdom of God Amen I I I try to look approachable and I try to look decent when I come to the kingdom of God Amen before the people of God Amen but what are the people I preached you couldn't care less if I had shoes on much less how expensive they were amen and I I think that's where the kingdom of God needs to come back to back to that side of humility where we just do what God requires us to do amen rather than try to build up some kind of a kingdom remember what Jesus said wherever your heart is that's where your treasure is going to be we invest millions of dollars into programs and everything else amen now listen if you're going to do something he said make a great A1 tape or have a great product if you're going to do it do the very best that you can do amen but some people their best is just Absolut absolutely flamboyant and and almost braggadocious in a lot of ways amen I don't believe God wants us to live that kind of way that's a peing to the eye that's the gate to the eye and then what you see is you see a lot of churches in the message in they start pattering after that and if we ain't careful then men are putting their churches in debt going deeper and deeper in things and trying to get bigger and bigger and bigger and in order to get a bigger Church they got to compromise a little bit every time they do it just to get a few more people in the the chairs amen get a few more Bodies Warm Bodies in the pews amen I would rather amen lay on my stomach drink Branch water and eat soda crackers and serve god with five in a church much less compromise my standards just to get a church full of people amen if some of these guys want a church full why don't they do what brother Carol used to say do he said go out to the street corner lay some empty hands on some empty heads call a few women to preach you'll have a mega church within a month amen every everybody loves a message of love and grace and mercy and long as you don't preach on their lifestyle and tell them how to live amen they love that don't you think so amen but the real bride of Christ wants to be corrected they want to be straight thy rod thy staff they comfort me that's what comforts me is to know I'm right with God Amen to know that his word is leading me in a direction where I can be corrected by his spirits if I got that kind of conscience in me amen I will never be deceived by the eye that's right right and if I'm elected I cannot be deceived you say Amen to that you know that's right amen amen that's right now looking at this uh this direction I want to take about the way that this works for us I I I'm I'm coming from a study here uh uh it's from MIT they did in 2014 and I thought this was incredible they said that people can identify an image as fast as 13 milliseconds so in other words before you have an understanding out here in your conscious mind of what you've seen there's a part of your subconscious mind that's already caught what you looked at the minute you see it the minute your eyes behold it whmo it's done lodged in there that's one reason why we got to be careful what we view on the internet and careful what we view on phones and careful what we expose our eyes to and television and movies and all these other kind of things like that because you hear people say well I can control it not according to this you can't according to this your mind and your mind and your spirit catches it way faster on the back side than it does on the front side where you can fully understand and digest what it is you're even looking at because of that amen Satan knows how the human being is made up so he works according to that knowledge if you ever notice in the last day how fast things move amen you you can scroll through Instagram Facebook or some of these things amen every little video is 30 seconds 50 seconds a minute long because they know they know that when you're looking at all of these things like that amen that your mind is catching one image after another after another after another amen and they don't care whether you can unpack it or digest it or not they just want the image implanted in your mind and then as a minister traveling Amen brother Smith how many times I've lost counts of it I've lost count of the times that people have come come to me I'm upset troubled depressed discouraged and I don't even know why and now as I study this I'm coming back to saying all right what is it that you're putting before your eyes that's planting itself in your spirit what is it that's getting inside you that's making you feel the way that you're feeling amen that's why we've got to be careful somebody said I can monitor it not without the Holy Ghost you can't Satan is a lot smarter than you are amen I have a hard time amen being able to understand things when it's being digested have to stop and read it and think about it and study on it amen I I might be an intelligent guy to some some degree but at the same time I still have to work on it to figure out how it all comes together but Satan knows how to plant these things in our human Spirits amen now looking at this in Exodus chapter 20 picking up verse three look at 3 four and five and you'll study right here how that he said in the Ten Commandments Thou shalt have no other gods before me Thou shalt not make unto thee any Graven image or any likeness of anything that is in the heaven above in the earth beneath or that is in the water or under the Earth Thou shalt not bow thyself down to them nor serve them amen and what are we seeing today we're seeing influencers coming across Instagram Facebook Twitter all these different things and what are they they are images being erected before people that are modern day gods and goddesses amen just as Pagan as Greek mythology just as devilish as Catholicism setting before the people's eyes people worshiping worshiping at the feet of some of these influencers worshiping at the feet of who's got the biggest YouTube channel on on the net amen and this is exactly what God told him don't put no other gods before you because God knew as our creator what kind of of person we would be and how we would absorb these things that we looked at in Deuteronomy 4:1 16 Moses is referring back to the Ten Commandments and he said letest you corrupt yourselves and make you a Graven image now watch the image now Moses is identifying the image can bring corruption to you why in 13 milliseconds your mind is catching something it's absorbing something and it's actually bringing into your human Spirit Corruption of ideas Doctrine thoughts moldings morale and anything else and morals for that matter it can be corrupting you in a moment of time and you don't even realize it's happening you ever wonder where kids are getting these crazy ideas that they get from today all of the stuff that they get in their mind and you wonder where in the world did they hear stuff like that if parents were smart enough and if men and women were Godly enough to go back and take a look at all the social media they've been exposed to what kind of pages they're following what kind of things that they're getting involved in you'd find out that Satan is sewing into the hearts of this generation things and ideas that are as contrary to the word of God as it could possibly Beall Satan using the eye again using the eye to behold an image notice Let me let me show you how this runs together in the serpent SE brother R said this is 1958 now you imagine in 58 is saying this take some of these old movie actors and get up here married four and five times living with three or four different husbands at the same time and some of these magazines exposing them taking pictures naked and everything and you little girls set that as your example and notice how brother bam is using this to show us the power of imagery and do you know there's a statement they call this the in science and psychology and sociology and things they call this the picture superiority effect that a picture has the ability to not only ingrain within your mind in a moment's time the image that you're looking at but also it what they call dual encoding in other words that picture without a word on it can not only put the image in your mind but it also sends a message that dual encodes itself into your spirit and when you're looking they say a picture is a thousand words when you're looking at a certain image and you see this image setting out yonder whatever thought you would attached to that image it becomes encoded in your hearts oh you say well brother Ben that's not really that important I beg your pardon brother bam talked about these three boys that had uh stayed together in the same room they had a picture of a ship on the sea out there on the on the wall and they looked at this picture every day he said down through time they come to the spot to where every single one of those boys I think it was three of them in a room all three of them became Sailors in a part of the Navy in some way why they have an influence upon us what we see and what we behold has an influence upon what we listen to what we think how we think about things and H how what kind of filter we use to hear certain things and you wonder why that people when they sit in the house of God Amen can't concentrate more than about 30 seconds that's because this ain't no Instagram re and this ain't no Facebook post that's right amen and this ain't no short YouTube video or some of those kind of things things amen and it's training them training them to lose their focus and then you come to church and preach 45 minutes and it's just about kills them and yet they could sit in front of their phone for three straight hours never even get up and go to the bathroom amen why what they're seeing has an influence upon their character it's right reidentifying them amen now in Psalm 101:3 David said I will set a Wicked thing before my eyes let me go on record here and say something whether or not you watch television or don't whether not you watch movies or don't whether not you have Netflix Hulu prime or any of these other things that's up to you I'm not a legalist you make a decision on what things you do when ain't nobody looking you make the decision to watch or listen to whatever you want to watch and whatever you want to listen to but I will say this the holy spirit is not assess pool amen and if you're born again of the Holy Ghost you're not going to be setting a bunch of stuff before you that's going to grieve the Lord that's true and if it is something that Grieves the Lord and you got the Holy Ghost I guarantee you'll do your best to get away from it amen I'm not interested in watching a bunch of shoot them upups and cussing and all that kind of stuff like that I'm not interested in things like that amen and then for all of you book readers sitting in here that would be critical against the television Watchers just be careful what kind of book you're you're getting into cuz you can create the same world up here and you can have the same world going on up here that somebody's watching on a television screen well Hallelujah the word's Amen in case you forgot it that's right now David said no Wicked thing no Wicked thing before my eyes but watch here in a way of a true Prophet brother says again television uncensored picture shows he said dirt filth makes an example look at our young kids today look at our girls little bitty fell coming from school not over six seven or eight years old lighting up a cigarette why is it their mama before them probably done it and if they didn't do it it might have been some of the kids that they're associating with and brother BR says watch who your kids play with right right he says now you know let's say brother Jesse some some Slick Rick come down to your house this evening wanting to be buddies with some of your girls sitting here he had tattoos all over him and he you know and he had a had a pack of cigarettes in his pocket and you know and cussed out of both sides of his mouth I imagine before you had the opportunity to say get out of my house you've done formulated a plan about how this dude ain't never coming around here no more yes sir why would we say such a thing in our mind we think I I don't want somebody like that associating with my children yet when it comes to things like social media they've got 4,689 friends that have all got the same type of attributes about them it's just the difference is they're not exactly in your home physically they come in your home and through a different medium same exact way that television brought these things in why do the churches have the problems that they have today why did they allow the things they go on brother Ram told us the invasion of the United States was Hollywood invaded the United States and ultimately invaded the pull pits he said now people want Hollywood glamour instead of the preaching of the Gospel they want somebody exciting to bring the truth to them they want somebody that can move them and motivate them and like I said this morning they want a TED Talk style of things amen they don't want somebody to just preach the gospel barehanded bare-fisted and just bring it Right Down the Line raw because we're living in a generation of people that get triggered and hurt and offended over everything that moves and how is that Bunch ever going to come to the place to where they'll be Rapture Ready when it's going to take a preacher that will not only cut your hide but strip it Plum from the bones to get you ready for the gospel's for the gospel's finish for Rapture amen triggered people don't do good in church with my kind of preaching amen amen people that get triggered or get their feelings hurt I'm a hard preacher for them to listen to amen because to them I've offended every way of life they've ever had amen but that's the generation we're listening to and watching and and and and seeing on on all of our social media all of the platforms amen and I'm only going to call a few just for the sake of it amen but there's hundreds of platforms out there that people are so absorbed in that they can't even simply allow themselves to separate from that and sit down and read their Bible I'm talking about the book itself amen and read the word of God they're attached to everything in social media everything is electronic these days amen but reading the Bible I've never had a popup a text message a voicemail or nothing reading the Bible I've always read the Bible and it's always just the Bible there's nothing there to click nothing there to swipe nothing there to ex out I can just read the word of God and spend time with the Lord Jesus and I love that don't you in those morning hours when amen all of my youngans are asleep and I get a little time and I flip my Bible open and stop and read for a little while amen that's what I love to get alone with the word and imagine where this little girl got this idea from Brother B says it just in a I'm saying this in a different way the same idea though it was modeled before her said probably some Mammy or some kid they're associating with Now watch how that converts over here to this 21st century to 2024 doing a study on ecigarettes or vaping the youth in 2017 and 2018 had a rise of 78% in high school students with nearly three out of five teens vaping in high school the where the idea they got this from where this come from is that when they conducted a study of social media they found that over 30,000 videos were on YouTube of people vaping the jewel cigarettes juuu L and there was over 100 million views recorded and reported of kids vaping some of the they have seven sites on Instagram some on third party and different ones with 2.5 million followers of Just The Vaping cigaretts amen e cgar an you say now why is this important because I'm trying to show you something The Same Spirit that brother bam said was there when they would watch their friends or their mother do it look how much it's multiplied in the last day out here across these platforms like that amen three out of five high school students are vapid they told him in the very beginning that it was harmless that it wasn't as bad as cigaretts and all the science proved that the kids that are vaping it's actually 10 times worse for their body and their lungs than if they were smoking a regular old fashioned cigarette amen and then the kids can go into school School my wife you talk to her sometime with these middle school kids they had to put up machines in the bathroom to catch the smoke cuz they were doing it so often and they can sit in the classroom with their head on the desk like this and they can Vape that Vapor right onto the desk amen and not even get caught pull their hoodie over their head and vape into their hood and right in class and nobody can catch them all that easy amen but what is it it is an age of changing the identity amen no longer are these kids wanting to become engineers or Scholars or scientists every single one of them are wanting to become influencers and find a way to sit in a chair in front of a computer screen and make all kinds of money amen and what it's done is it's rotted the brain of this new generation coming amen they might be smart as a whip about how to be able to split an atam but ain't none of them got hardly any common Horse Sense amen and that's the problem amen is it's causing the mind of the people to become now listen close to become robotic in other words monkey see and monkey do and they're following a trend they're following a pattern as they follow that pattern amen and the Holy Spirit is trying to get the minds and the spirit of the people of this age Amen to look up and to look at the word of God and instead of looking up most of them are sitting there looking down focusing on everything except for the word of God and for what time they're living in brother bam even said it he said when I come to a new year he said I want to know what the hour is and where I'm living and how far up the road I'm at amen he wasn't interested in uh going back and and and and un ringing bells that have already been rung he wanted to know where am I at today in my walk with God he didn't want to be distracted from the things that are out there now many years ago they produced this Theory called the cultivation Theory this is a t test to show the impact of television on viewers the key of this theory was they found that the more time that people spent living in a television world the more likely they were believe they were to believe that what they saw on television was the same thing they saw in reality you know Marilyn Monroe was supposedly the most beautiful woman in the world did you know that she's definitely according to all of the historians the most photograph woman in the world but did you also know that she had cartilage here cheekbone implants there she had augmentations from the top of her head to the sole of her feet to look like she looked it wasn't natural normagene that we first meet you know and the uh the little old bun thing tied up around her hair and some of those early photographs standing out by a fence with a piece of straw on her mouth no this was the super duper modified version of Norma genene the Maryland Monro that we know today and yet all of those enhancements when they would see her on that television somebody bought her those clothes and somebody dressed her and done her makeup and somebody did her hair left her her own devices she may not have looked like that in normal life but they created an image on the television and now every woman wanted to chase that listen to brother bam amen down here in 1963 talking about Tommy Hicks he said and what it was he said there was Sister Hicks seeing those wom out there with them Jacqueline Kennedy Waterhead haircuts and followed that example out there until it pulled him into those worldly systems like that amen imagine what he says here he said it's a matching day this is in future home he said you paint your steps red today and your neighbor can't stand it till he paints his own red why they're always looking for a way to identify themsel with something that they see and television social media all of these things out there are creating an imagery that's influencing people to think in a different manner than what is actual reality you go back and listen at some of these reality stars I done a little digging into the life of this Matthew Perry that just di one of the friends on the friend show you know and and and you know they always advertise these guys their friends their buddies and everything is hunky dory and a bunch of laughs and all that the guy absolutely was a horrible drug addict amen was in and out of rehab so many times it was ridiculous and yet when you would watch maybe perhaps a moment of him on a program and a show and laughing and carrying on as his character you might look at him and think everything is all right but he is a classic example of every movie star and let me say every influencer and every person on social media they only create what you want them to see but behind the scenes their life is a wreck and a mess oh now you say but brother Ben what's that got to do with me none of this influences me I'm not a TV Watcher I don't fool with social media yes but how has that filtrated itself into the church it has infiltrated the church amen because pastors and evangelists and preachers alike and even the congregations amen are beginning to form themsel in an image of everything is okay listen brother it doesn't make great big hits on YouTube and other programs and live streaming amen with the church laying with with amen slobber coming out of their mouth and folks shouting all over the building and on and on Amen what they want to see is somebody with some round Rim glasses and the light reflect off that gesture just perfect and the congregation clap in unison say Amen on time what is it created Hollywood evangelism but it's created a Hollywood church and then the glow of the oldfashioned Gospel is begin to dissipate away from the people that we call Believers of the end time message and it's created such an influence around us until we can't sing songs unless they're absolutely perfect every note has to be Flawless every every vo vocal part has to be exactly perfect or else they won't put you on their podcast or on their whatever amen and yet the Bible said Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord amen amen what is it it's a stolen identity taking away the identity of the people of the day and I'm just giving you a few little examples here to show you how it is out there but this same thing has crept into the church and people are beginning to formulate this imagery of what they think the bride of Christ is supposed to look like amen and let me tell you what kind of thing brother bam said it in Christ is a mystery the prophet of God said that one of these days they would close CL the doors of the churches he said like this one talking about his own Tabernacle well I've challenged this at different times what kind of church should brother Bram have certainly wasn't a tape church that's right am there certainly wasn't a church that didn't believe in worship and it certainly wasn't a church that believe didn't believe in the gifts of the spirits that's right and it certainly wasn't a church that didn't believe in Deliverance or salvation or oldfashioned altar calls so where did this imagery come from from Hollywood crept itself into the church taking the family constellation and putting them in a mindset of they'd rather watch We Love Lucy than come to church they have to be entertained remember what Paul said in the last day they would come to the place that be lovers of pleasure more than theyd be lovers of God right and then instead of the preacher you know being some old ugly thing and he doesn't got his hair combed and comes out with old clothes and holes in them he's got to be some Stellar you know the shine and the slick and everything it's got to be just right he's got to be handsome right you know but if he's a little heavy set and not that goodlooking hey well we not so sure about that guy but there's got to be some goodlook thing out there he's got to make an impact so when they stream the television thing they got out there everything looks just like they wanted to everything proper and Prim and that is where the churches come into a place and brother R said they would shut the doors of those kind of churches look at what people are doing today around the ranks of this message you have a grouping of people amen that don't want the nine spiritual gifts in their Church they don't want people crying and weeping their way through to Christ in an oldfashioned altar they don't want prayer lines they don't want nobody B you know uh dying out to themselves and crying and burden over with the things of God they want some nice little church that believes a message and goes home after they do their religion that's right but that's not the kind of church that's going to get shut down that's right and listen friends a lot of people vote with their feet it don't have to be some kind of ecumenical move out here that comes and slaps a sign on that door out there people vote with their feeds they vote with their participation they vote for what they support and if they don't want that kind of church they can shut it down by not supporting it that's right and that's what happens a lot of times they get mad at the preacher because he looks right at them when he say I won't go back to that church they don't have no love there triggered over every little thing feelings hurt over every little thing but they're blending together real life with what they've been exposed to out there in the world families are the same way listen to this brother R was talking about identified Christ he said I was hearing on the radio coming home some great Italian man in Denver was playing a Hopalong Cassidy with a loaded gun he said now instead of that is going to be a Chester the rest of his life cuz he shot his kneecap off he said there you go people trying to find something to identify themselves with now let's turn to Daniel chapter 1 verse 6 let me get to the meat of this right here and then let's let's move on with the thoughts a little bit amen is this all right say amen amen now when we look at these things we recognize that Satan is not only trying to shape this world remember he came to Eve through the eye everything has to be beautiful and fine but let me quote to you what brother bam said he said that a tuxedo suit with the Holy Ghost can put his arm around a pair of overhauls with the Holy Ghost and love him and call him brother there should be no shame in other words economic status shouldn't put us in the mind of saying somebody is beneath us amen that's how how we'll win the loss to Jesus Christ friends I wonder how many churches around this message would really genuinely open their doors brother Jesse to the some prostitute drunkard drug addict coming into the church and sitting down wanting to find peace in his soul with God how many of them be welcome to that they don't want that they've got their fine program established with all their fine people and all their fine uh clothing and cars and everything just the way but my God if the woman the well showed up and sat on the front row it would almost cause heart failure they need some of them doctors around there to do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation but that's the kind of crowd that Jesus hung out with listen to this while you're getting ready to read with me brother BR said Jesus made his reputation with Sinners that's how he made his reputation not by what you see in the eye listen this in marriage and divorce Judas was handsome he said but Jesus didn't look like some some God walking along he said he was humble and the Bible said we turned away our faces it was looking at him amen that's the humble of it he talks about the glow of the real true gold he said rather than the shine and the flashh and the glitz of he said pyite or Fool's cold that's what the world chases after today they chase after all kinds of false things I feel sorry for some of our young people connected to these things like they are because everything they see on there whether folks realize it or not is designed to steal your true identity it's designed to take away from you every magazine every billboard every radio program every television show remember Satan is the God of this world that is his marketing his advertising his broadcasting and his streaming yes and every one of those things whether we realize it or not is designed to steal the identity of true children of god let's look at this in Daniel chapter 1:6 now among these were or uh verse six rather chapter 1 verse 6 now among these were the children of Judah Daniel haniah Michel and as Azariah unto whom the prince of the Unix gave names now watch this the first thing he did was he reidentified them their names represented their commitment and their dedication to Jehovah God every name that was given to these children of Israel was placed there as a commitment to Yahweh but I want you to notice to Daniel he calls him Bazar aanii shadra Misha mesach Azariah abedo this was the reidentifying of these men to give them names that represent presented a tie to Babylonian deities and each one of these deities would now be the emphasis upon the nature of these boys you think about how this works you say well there's nothing in a name wait a minute now when God came to Abram one of the first things he did when he was really getting down to the time the promise is going to be fulfilled he changed his name from Abram to Abraham right changed it from s to S ey he called change Simon over to Peter amen as I said the other night thinking about this myself coming up the road amen we wouldn't even think about the word Jezebel as being a bad name if we didn't know the character that was attached to that name names do have a meaning the last day God sent two Messengers one down to Sodom and he sent one up here to stay with Abraham both of them their last name ended an HM amen even the beginning of the the Pentecostal Church the Pentecostal movement one of the first changes over was a param hm and moving into this hour coming from that Methodist time into the lady oan age here God sends another ham which means father of Nations amen and that Billy Graham is producing Sons amen that doctrine of that ecumenical thing amen and brother Branham produced sons of God as well through the word sown through the word heard but they reidentified him by their name part of their training was to immerse them in Babylonian culture listen to this they changed the food they ate they changed the the the culture that the the the books they read they changed the language they spoke when when have you ever seen such a way people talk nowadays I heard this preacher get up some time ago and he was reading what they call the Gen X no it's not Gen X it's gen Z isn't it the Gen I'm Gen X I think or somewhere around there anyways the Gen Z Bible and they were talking about things like you know they just read it just the way that some of these kids talk about how sus it was and and all of these kind of things I understand what writers are trying to do they're trying to appeal to a certain generation but if we're not careful will forget that it's programming it's training to get them to think in a different way amen you say well why does our language have to be any certain way at all think about when you first was introduced to Jesus Christ amen it changed the very way you spoke your language changed altoe that's what he said what happened in Mark 16 they'd speak with new tongues it changed the way that we approached even the way we had conversations in the thing we talked about but the world today is fashioning everything in a manner to train even the way we speak would you imagine some poor kid trying to come up and get right with God triggered about everything that moved his feelings hurt about everything that move he'd have had a hard time being that sarap phenician woman wouldn't he God calling him a dog and telling him that he couldn't get nothing because it wasn't promised to him amen but God gives Grit and determination the real saints of God you believe that's true yes sir they gave them training to immerse them in Babylonian culture and remember in Babylon the very first place that the language Chang was in Babel and when Nebuchadnezzar sets his kingdom up running right through the middle of Babylon was a stream or we would call it in this this day and age streaming it's a flood of things that come like old Chief said about what dog he fed he said whichever one he feeds that's what I said you got to be careful what comes through your feeds amen because these things are designed to pervert our minds away from the Simplicity that is in Jesus Christ remember Paul said I fear that your mind would be corrupted from the Simplicity that's in Jesus Christ amen now let's just look at how this all comes together a little bit 2 Timothy chapter 3 1-5 gives us what brother bam calls him the queen of the South a prophecy of what he called teenage rulership British Invasion The Beatles and the bugs and the alligators and the crocodiles and all the rest of them Elvis was a teenager Mr s Great Balls of Fire was a teenager Johnny Cash a teenager all of them came at the very time that the Bible prophesied disobedient to parents unruly unthankful Unholy Now watch how brother Bram identifies this in 1958 get a message called lifting them up out of History he said to see our teenage boys the men and women of Tomorrow teens today hair down their neck britches pulled down over their hips this is in 1958 y'all with a pistol stuck in their side and a cigarette out of the side of their mouth what is it slavery of the devil and where do they see such a thing watching all of the influences around them they begin to model themsel after what they see friends can't you see why it is so important to keep the image of this word before our eyes all the time the SAT name playing games he puts that imagery when you're riding down the road you can see things everywhere you turn around you you could get on the phone to read your Bible app and 25 things will pop up in your face that you got to XXXX swipe swipe swipe swipe swipe yes sir that's why quite honestly it's better if we just stick with this old fashion version like this amen it be a whole lot easier than trying to manage all that other stupidity right slavery of the devil he said in questions answers the teenage kids took over the world he said you know the Bible predicts that but here's what I love going back into Daniel picking up verse eight but Daniel I love this this is the Sons and Daughters of God right here Daniel purposed in his heart amen that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meets he made a decision in his heart I will not allow myself to be corrupted by the things that I see around me now I'm not a legalist if you're going to choose to have a cell phone and you're going to be connected to social media I'm on I'm on Facebook myself and and uh I've had YouTube channels I'm not against social media but the Holy Ghost is not a Cess pool and if you're going to be connected to things you've got to purpose in your heart I've got my lines my limits and my boundaries and I will not be corrupted by the things that I see before meall praise the Lord he purposed in his heart he would not be defiled you know the food they were feeding I'm more sacrificed to Idols you know many of those Foods they would feed to the children of Israel they wasn't prepared in the kosher style they were considered unclean maybe pork and other things like that and much of that food was already sacrificed to an idol and turn around and feed it to the children of Israel and you got these four right here that said I will not bow to the image of Daniel I will not bow to the image of anything yes but the rest of them Israelites just stayed hooked up in the Stream every one of them bowed except for those four and you know the image that was set up was the image of Daniel oh you say that ain't right hold on possessing the enemy's Gates brother R said us take him Hebrew children they to stood true and wouldn't tolerate image worship they refus to bow to the image of a holy man the image of Daniel he says now watch here in Isaiah CH 59: 19 let me hurry I'm closing he said so they they that fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood or a stream the spirit of the Lord shall raise up a standard against him that tells us that Satan is going to come in and flood this world you see he copycats everything God does God had his delou now Satan's bringing his Del Lou and his purpose is to drown the saints of God drown them in technology drown them in busyness drown them in this thing and that thing Brother people talk to me about well we don't need the Holy Ghost like we used to I don't know what what in the world they're thinking we need the Lord Jesus more now than we've ever needed him so all of these things are a part of a society a society of people an army that Satan is building of people that will absolutely but be so complete and I'm just going to say this as nice as I know how but they'll be so completely perverted and robotic that all it's going to take is a little nudge and all of them will fall down and worship the image of the Beast taking the mark of the beast to be cast into tribulation do you understand that if you're a message person you have enough in You by revelation of the spirit that there's no way that you're ever going to bow down to the pope or any of these other things but if Satan can change that image and make it brother brandom or a pastor or an evangelist or something or mommy or daddy or the house or some other thing he doesn't care who you bow to As Long as You bow right and anything you put between you and God becomes an idol and God said don't set any image up before me but you think about all of those spirits that came out now listen to this in in Feast of the trumpets brother said those 2,000,000 Horsemen were bound at the river Euphrates but in the last day are loosed upon the bride so in other words the lid of Hell itself is being pulled off and dumped out upon this generation Satan coming in like a flood never never in 6,000 years of man's history has he had access to the mind the spirit the heart and in 13 milliseconds he can grab somebody's attention never has he had that kind of power before yes but now he holds everything right here in the palm of his hand and he can influence people right in the middle of the night in their own beds can I read you a few figures and stats here I don't want this to bore you so I'm going to try to preach my way through it a little bit but 75% of American teenagers ages 13 to 17 have access to a smartphone 75% think of that Facebook has 2.8 billion monthly active users YouTube has two billion logged in every month WhatsApp two billion Instagram a billion monthly active and Tik Tock over a billion monthly active so you've got all of these billions of people that are connected to the flood without the Holy Ghost what do you think's going to happen CU remember Satan is forming a generation of people into an image of something just like Babylon did here and renaming what do people do when they get on the on the internet first thing they do is choose a new name they don't always use their original name because they're scared of all the mess and and things that people can search them out and find out who they are so they change their name to some other kind of thing and then they change their identity they filter themselves to look a whole lot better than what they really look sure and listen the Bible said not to make images of animals and things like that too look at the generation we're living in where kids are acting like furries or cats they call them and things like that and they'll put these images of all these animals and things up above them Hey listen being silly and having fun as a little kid or something that might be one thing but some of these people are identifying themsel with a trend of society that is designed by the devil to take them away from Jesus Christ to re-identify themselves where the majority of them don't have any kind of feeling in their own self of their own selfworth or their own their own insignificance or their own importance to the kingdom of God listen to these these numbers 44% of people on social media will experience online harassment or abuse 42% of young people report feeling sad or depressed after using social media for an extended period of time 21% of teenagers feel worse about their own lives because of what they see on social media social media has been linked to feelings of loneliness and social isolation and a study found that the one of the worst social media platforms for mental health including anxiety depression poor body image Amen in a study done that half of 1200 uh 18 to 34 year olds felt unattractive when they looked at their social media feed another 60% felt their own achievements were inadequate when compared to the post of others and I'm going to ask you a question you may get that out of social media or what you see in school or what you see on television or what you see out here in this world in a restaurant or something like that amen but I've never looked into the Bible and walked away feeling depressed or anxious or low selfworth and brother R called this the bride's Looking Glass this is what we need to be looking into focusing on the word of God on Amen imagine this the overuse of social media has contributed to depression anxiety jealousy loneliness isolation self harm poor body image Eating Disorders like anorexia and disrupted sleep you tell me or tell me not is that a flood or ain't it yes sir all created right here yes sir people scrolling scrolling scrolling to their own demise according to a journal of movement disorders in certain a certain time period this was about maybe somewhere around 2020 they said girls between 20 and excuse me 12 and 17 they started seeing an A A an uptick in the uh disorders tick disorders movement now some of these kids were proved out later they would just faking and acting just to get attention but some of them were legitimate disorders and they they' done a a bit of research to find out why were these girls entering into tourettes and all these other kind of things like that and it said because they were watching Tik Tock and YouTube specifically and watching people with those disorders and that thing came on them just like Paul said looking into a glass Darkly becoming the image of the thing you're looking at oh you say ain't that powerful hold on when Jacob the little Shyer was trying to get a hold of was was laban's cows I think think he had them pregnated cows look in the water at them sticks with the stripes on it and that looking in that water like that marked that cow on the inside you say it don't happen that way yes it does brother B said when he was talking about he said the rock and roll strip teases he said why are you a rock and roll strip tease he said because your Mammy was a flapper and your grandma was a chorus girl you think it doesn't Mark that child sin is visited from the fourth generation all the way down the line yes sir it marks them all the way down what they see what influences on them brings them to this kind of thing they say that social media addiction is linked to higher rates of anxiety depression and poor Sleep Quality of course it is as they stay up half the night watching this stuff and in the University of Birmingham they did a study on girls 13 to 15 they showed them certain images off of social media and these girls kept feeling discouraged intimidating insecure and they felt 10 times worse looking at these unrealistic images they put before them and some of the girls said it was like those pictures were fat shaming them I don't know if you know what fat shaming is but of the words making them feel like they're fat and overweight and ugly and all that kind of stuff they were showing them fake pictures and these girls just by watching these images starting feeling lower and lower and lower and lower and lower about themselves and yet here's brother bam in 1958 saying these Hollywood movies and these people out there married four and five times and the girls taking that thing for their example what could this generation have been if they would have kicked Hollywood out of America well I may not be able to kick it out of America but I can sure kick it out of my life and my home and I can take a stand against those kind of things therefore my brother sister we cannot be dependent upon the inventors or the AR artificers of these instruments to be The Gatekeepers of our home we must be The Gatekeepers of our life realizing the eye is the gateway to the soul that's exactly what's happening the world today is what they're calling renegotiating the family constellation and so nowadays it isn't mom and dad but it's Mom who thinks he's a dad dad thinks he's a mom or two mommies or two daddies or whoever else they plan on putting in the middle of the family and the kids himself have no genuine identity of who they're supposed to be and Friends listen close how does that apply to us in a message if we're not careful we do the same exact things with the message of the hour we set before them an image of what a Christian's supposed to be how Christian supposed to behave but if we get too legalistic interject all of our ideas and our thoughts toward things we can pervert the image of what a real Christian is and take away a person's autonomy and their free moral agency and force them to be a cookie cutter version of a Christian and what's left because they didn't make the decisions thems because they didn't follow along with the conviction of the Lord themsel they become a robot of the church system and that's why a lot of them will come and sit down in the pews and they hear what's going on counting the days and Biden the time that they can get out of that mess and go do their own thing that's why friends we have to keep our eyes squarely focused on the word of God Satan is trying to re-identify us out the world and also right here in the church we got to be wise to his deceits God bless you thank you for your patience I know that was a lot stand with me if you will I'm done we're going to close right there stolen identity we cannot let the devil steal our ident identity as Believers we can't let Church formal take away from us our real identity right our identity in Christ is to be another book of Acts can you say amen amen that's what we're supposed to be but friends with all of the outside influences coming in all of these things crushing down upon us if we're not careful we're going to find oursel in a spot where we absolutely don't know who we are and remember the prophet said when the bride knows who she is then the Rapture will come and we'll go out of here with Jesus Satan confuses the world he confuses the church he tries to put all kinds of things before us why why do you think let me say this quickly why do you think brother Bram was so hard on women like he was because brother Bram had enough spiritual discernment to know that this age goes out in such gross denominationalism he knew that the organizations that let in women cut their hair and wear pants and makeup and the men do any older Godly thing they want to do and come right into the church and call himself Believers he said deacons married two and three times pastors married two and three times the cigarette breaks after in between the church services and on and on and on and he said you Pentecostal people following right after the same thing so he had to make it clear he didn't call women dog meat to be mean he called them dog meat to make the line of demarcation clear enough this is what Holiness is this is what unholiness is amen and God had to make it that clear so we wouldn't be deceived and we would know what's truth amen God bless you let's sing something Worship the Lord a little bit I hope you enjoyed that amen I know it was a lot but I hope you enjoyed it God bless you anything you want to sing buddy us [Music] [Music] us [Music] yes Lord Jesus yes [Music] Lord yes Lord Jesus [Music] [Music] us you know I thought about something too you the prophet of God said we would come to a time to where the world would get so corrupted around us he said the squeeze would start pressing upon the elect is squeeze and squeeze upon that true real bride you know what he said we would do we would look away Hallelujah Look Away to Jesus and Jesus himself said if your eye be single your whole body be full of light that's right but if your eye be dark it'll make the whole body full of darkness and how great is that Darkness said Jesus right the eye be in the gate to the soul I I know some of this didn't specifically apply to many of you I I know that maybe this is not where you're living at it's okay it's okay I don't really care whether it is or not but you need to be aware of this kind of stuff because you don't know how quickly you can get in the middle of something and not even recognize you're in the middle of it that's right and I think it's good and time for us to have some good oldfashioned church honesty about where we're living Hallelujah and these things they're real if you got a cell phone in your hand don't you dare treat this like I I'm I'm immune I can't I'm not a Target I can control what I do you've already lost the battle right there that's right you ought to take this thing and lay it before God your tablet your computer you lay it before God and say God I dedicate this thing to the service of God you strengthen me you protect me Lord you keep me from anything that will take me in a wrong direction that's true but in the last day the bride is going to look way to Jesus hallelujah hallelujah God bless you let's sing something else I've enjoyed speaking to your friends amen we'll see you next time come to J yeah Jesus on my Jesus and the things will grow strange his glory Your Eyes On [Music] Jesus glor
