[0:00] this godhead series by the grace of the
[0:02] Lord
[0:04] is this mic up kind of loud it seems a
[0:06] little loud is that is that normal
[0:08] all right praise the Lord so let's go to
[0:10] uh
[0:11] second Corinthians 13 14. would like to
[0:13] start there
[0:14] maybe we'll finish this series tonight
[0:16] Lord willing we'll see how it goes
[0:24] trust everybody's having a good week in
[0:26] the Lord by God's grace Hallelujah
[0:31] last Wednesday we looked at Jesus's
[0:33] prayers in the Garden of Gethsemane we
[0:35] looked at Jesus's baptism
[0:38] we don't see three persons
[0:41] like most churches tell us we see one
[0:43] God manifesting himself in different
[0:46] ways praise God numerous ways at the
[0:48] same time so tonight Lord willing we'll
[0:50] look at uh
[0:52] different three-fold references of God
[0:57] so second Corinthians 13 verse 14.
[1:01] so doing some teaching here tonight by
[1:02] God's grace but trying to mix some
[1:04] preaching in here as well about the
[1:05] grace of the Lord
[1:09] let's read this together if we can here
[1:11] let's begin on three one two three the
[1:14] grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the
[1:17] love of God and the communion of the
[1:20] Holy Ghost be with you all praise God
[1:22] does anybody see three persons in there
[1:24] I don't see it safe it doesn't say three
[1:26] persons but it does give three
[1:28] attributes of the one almighty god let's
[1:32] have one more word of prayer just our
[1:33] heads here and you have a need on your
[1:34] heart just make it known unto God again
[1:36] we prayed once but let's pray again
[1:37] father God we come to the most important
[1:39] part Lord the singing really sets us
[1:41] free Lord God we thank you for that
[1:43] Hallelujah gets our hearts beating Lord
[1:45] God our bodies awake Lord our minds
[1:47] focused on you Hallelujah gets us off
[1:49] the distractions of the world and Onto
[1:51] You Lord the focus of our attention here
[1:54] tonight Lord God Hallelujah bless his
[1:56] time in your presence God anoint me God
[1:58] anoint your people each one needs the
[2:00] anointing of the Holy Spirit here
[2:01] tonight father may your spirit Lord deal
[2:03] with each and every need father God and
[2:06] Lord thank you for this topic Lord as we
[2:07] labored on it now for months Lord I just
[2:09] pray God it would just help those that
[2:11] need it Lord Jesus thank you for the
[2:13] wonderful testimonies we're getting back
[2:15] lord God and just continue to move
[2:17] direct these words Lord to exactly where
[2:19] they need to go feed your sheep here
[2:21] tonight we pray in Jesus Christ's name
[2:23] and Saint said amen God bless yours
[2:25] you're being seated praise God
[2:32] I'd like to continue on this thought on
[2:34] the mystery that God had I believe this
[2:35] is part seven if I'm not mistaken
[2:46] so threefold references of
[2:48] God
[2:49] we read second Corinthians 13 14.
[2:53] a lot of trinitarians who of course are
[2:55] wrong about God say this speaks of three
[2:58] persons but it never says uh three
[3:01] persons and in fact it really just shows
[3:03] the unity of God for example the grace
[3:06] of our Lord Jesus Christ so uh
[3:08] trinitarian see son love of God father
[3:12] and communion of the Holy Ghost now if
[3:14] you just pause just for a moment
[3:16] if this is speaking of three persons
[3:17] well does that mean Jesus has all the
[3:19] grace and God has no Grace
[3:21] of course not because I can take you to
[3:23] the Old Testament and and uh which one
[3:26] it was Ezra Ezra said God has given us
[3:28] Grace for a season of life
[3:30] so God the Father gave Grace in the Old
[3:32] Testament Hallelujah I'm going to
[3:35] believe Jesus is Love as well
[3:38] and how many believe you can have
[3:39] communion with the Heavenly Father Paul
[3:41] says that our prayer we have a high
[3:43] priest who makes intercession to God for
[3:45] us right so we have communion with the
[3:47] Son and the father
[3:49] we're to come boldly before the throne
[3:51] of grace so when you just look at it and
[3:53] you use a little bit of spiritual
[3:55] understanding you see how God is not
[3:57] speaking of three persons Paul's not
[3:59] speaking of three persons he's just
[4:01] speaking of three different offices or
[4:03] manifestations now the other example is
[4:05] Matthew 28 19 where Jesus said go
[4:08] baptize them in the name one name of the
[4:11] father Son and the Holy Ghost ten days
[4:13] later Peter said baptize them in the
[4:16] name of Jesus Christ when he was filled
[4:18] with the holy spirit so if we see that
[4:20] Jesus was revealing a mystery the Bible
[4:22] said Jesus would speak and utter he
[4:24] would utter dark sayings in other words
[4:25] he would utter Mysteries and this is one
[4:27] of those Mysteries there's one name so
[4:29] father son Holy Ghost that's the Lord
[4:31] Jesus Christ Hallelujah and then of
[4:34] course first time five seven we looked
[4:36] at this a number of months ago but the
[4:38] Bible says
[4:39] uh the Bible speaks of the Father the
[4:41] word and the Holy Ghost these three are
[4:44] one it doesn't say these three persons
[4:46] it just says there's three there's three
[4:48] father word Holy Ghost praise God anyone
[4:51] that knows the Bible knows the father is
[4:53] Holy and the father is a ghost the
[4:54] father is a spirit Jesus prayed uh to
[4:57] his father the holy spirit so father and
[4:59] holy spirit are one and the Bible says
[5:00] in the beginning was the word the word
[5:02] was with God and the Word was God
[5:05] so we see one person we don't see three
[5:07] persons we see one person but this one
[5:10] person had to manifest himself in three
[5:13] ways to redeem man he had to be a father
[5:15] over all creation praise God it'll be a
[5:17] father over Adam and Eve amen but then
[5:20] he had to become a son in order to pay
[5:21] the penalty for sin and then he had to
[5:24] become the Holy Ghost to live in the
[5:26] hearts of the Believers praise God
[5:27] hallelujah amen thank God and that's how
[5:30] that's how God plans salvation Father
[5:33] Son and Holy Ghost on the inside of us
[5:36] praise God so we see it's it's necessary
[5:39] God is saying it's necessary you must
[5:41] recognize father-son Holy Ghost for
[5:44] salvation but God never said cut them up
[5:46] into three persons persons if you add
[5:49] persons to the Bible now you become a
[5:51] liar the Bible says when you add to the
[5:53] word the Bible says God will call you a
[5:55] liar so we don't want to be called Liars
[5:57] on the day of judgment praise God
[5:58] although we want to be called beloved we
[6:01] want to be called sought out let's
[6:02] listen to the end of that sermon I
[6:03] preached a few weeks ago we want to be
[6:04] called sought out not forsaken
[6:06] hallelujah praise God that's what we
[6:08] want to be called amen the Beloved of
[6:10] the Lord hallelujah
[6:12] now
[6:13] so those three those three offices are
[6:16] attributes prove we must uh Believers
[6:19] must recognize God's three
[6:21] manifestations
[6:22] if if you lived in either one of those
[6:24] and you neglected it it was uh judgment
[6:27] for sure
[6:28] the Pharisees rejected the sun
[6:30] manifestation they loved the father
[6:31] manifestation but they rejected the
[6:33] current Sun manifestation and Jesus said
[6:35] if you don't believe in me you'll die in
[6:37] your sins
[6:38] praise God
[6:40] and then when the Holy Ghost come to
[6:41] speak against the Holy Ghost Stephen
[6:43] said you always resist the Holy Ghost
[6:45] you blasting the Holy Ghost
[6:47] so to speak against the Holy Ghost and
[6:49] the Believers who are following the real
[6:51] Holy Ghost is an awful awful sin we
[6:54] better watch our words praise God we
[6:55] better make sure we we call what is God
[6:58] really of God Amen we've got to judge it
[7:00] the right way how am I going to know
[7:01] brother Jess test it by the word praise
[7:03] God give it the word test amen
[7:05] hallelujah praise God all these years
[7:08] sister Emma I've been preaching oh is it
[7:10] now 16 years 18 years I've been
[7:11] preaching 18 years I've yet for somebody
[7:13] to show me a verse where God calls
[7:15] himself three persons all these years
[7:17] I'm waiting I'm just waiting my uh my
[7:19] battery runs out I've been waiting so
[7:20] long for somebody come show me where God
[7:23] is three persons or show me where the
[7:24] disciples baptized father son Holy Ghost
[7:26] praise God
[7:28] or show me uh any of these truths that
[7:30] where a woman where God told a Godly
[7:32] woman to cut her hair where did God tell
[7:34] a woman to to wear makeup where did God
[7:36] ever do that where did God ever tell a
[7:39] woman to marry a woman or a man to marry
[7:40] man I've been waiting 18 years I imagine
[7:42] I'll keep waiting praise God but one
[7:44] thing for sure I'll keep preaching God's
[7:46] truth because God's spirit directs us
[7:48] into all truth amen Hallelujah and
[7:50] that's our absolute the Bible is the
[7:52] absolute praise God and we say it with
[7:54] love amen hallelujah but love is always
[7:56] corrective Hallelujah you love God God's
[7:59] going to the Bible says that God loves
[8:00] you he's going to correct you he's going
[8:02] to rebuke you he's going to correct you
[8:03] he's going to speak to you and he's
[8:04] going to direct you praise God any good
[8:06] parent will correct their child
[8:08] the Bible said if you don't love your
[8:10] Bible said if you don't chasing your
[8:11] child you don't even love your child
[8:13] Hallelujah so love is corrective but
[8:16] love is also loving too love is also
[8:18] merciful too we're not going to leave
[8:19] that out praise God hallelujah I mean
[8:21] how many experience God sent her love
[8:23] praise God
[8:24] oh I've seen it so many times
[8:25] financially he's provided for us my
[8:27] forgiveness he's provided when we don't
[8:29] feel like we deserve forgiven when we
[8:31] feel guilty but then the Holy Spirit
[8:32] Will confess our sins and the Holy
[8:34] Spirit will make us feel forgiven that
[8:36] that's that's more than life to me
[8:37] praise God
[8:38] so yes we get correction but we also get
[8:40] the love of God Amen
[8:41] we get all of it because we're children
[8:43] of God
[8:44] Jesus said he that blasting the Holy
[8:46] Ghost shall not be forgiven
[8:48] remember you can do it with ignorance as
[8:50] Paul said in first Timothy chapter 1.
[8:53] now uh Paul and John both write
[8:56] greetings when they're writing their
[8:58] letters and they mention uh
[9:01] Father Son and Holy Ghost I'm sorry they
[9:04] mentioned only Father and Sons let's
[9:05] quickly put those up there and you're on
[9:07] duty tonight so God bless you Romans 1
[9:10] 7. Romans 1 7. now notice
[9:13] Paul never sent mentions the Holy Ghost
[9:15] he just talks about the father and the
[9:17] son to all that be in Rome beloved of
[9:19] God Called to be Saints grace to you and
[9:21] peace from God our Father and the Lord
[9:23] Jesus Christ he doesn't mention the Holy
[9:25] Ghost
[9:26] was Paul like a was Paul of two persons
[9:28] and not a three persons
[9:30] no
[9:32] it just it's just not necessary to
[9:34] mention all three
[9:35] it's not necessary to do that every
[9:37] single time that's what the Catholic
[9:38] does they have every single time I like
[9:39] I told you I went to the funeral they
[9:41] did that maybe 50 or 100 times in a
[9:43] matter of half an hour
[9:45] but that's not what the Bible says First
[9:47] Corinthians 1 3.
[9:49] because we know the father is the Holy
[9:51] Ghost praise God
[9:52] Grace be unto you in peace from God our
[9:54] Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ
[9:56] first John 1 verse 3 first John 1 verse
[9:59] three you're getting real fast there
[10:00] honey I appreciate that
[10:02] that which we have seen and heard
[10:03] declare we unto you that ye Also may
[10:05] have fellowship with us and truly our
[10:07] fellowship is with the father and with
[10:08] the son Jesus Christ now apologize for a
[10:10] minute didn't our opening verse say we
[10:12] have communion with the Holy Ghost
[10:14] huh well right here he says our
[10:16] fellowship is with the father and the
[10:17] son
[10:18] ah well maybe Paul doesn't know as much
[10:21] as John does
[10:22] or maybe vice versa nah that's nonsense
[10:25] they both have the same Revelation
[10:27] praise God
[10:28] it's not about three persons it's about
[10:30] one God hallelujah
[10:33] so see
[10:34] did Paul only believe in two persons or
[10:36] did John only believe even two persons
[10:38] no it's not necessary to always mention
[10:40] the Holy Ghost because Paul knew John
[10:42] knew the father of the Holy Ghost or the
[10:44] self-sane person
[10:45] Hallelujah
[10:47] so we see uh at church this this godhead
[10:50] is an enigma which means a mystery the
[10:52] Bible calls it an enigma in the Hebrew
[10:55] in the Old Testament it's called an
[10:56] enigma dark sayings Jesus would utter
[10:58] dark sayings the book of Psalm says and
[11:00] that was an enigma or a mystery this is
[11:03] a mysterious thing
[11:05] see because all now let's go back to
[11:07] Second Corinthians 13 14 honey all three
[11:10] attributes pertaining to God grace love
[11:12] and communion
[11:14] but in this one verse Paul just points
[11:17] out how uh God uses these three
[11:19] attributes with the three different
[11:21] manifestations
[11:23] for example the Bible he said the grace
[11:25] of our Lord Jesus Christ
[11:27] see in another place the Bible said
[11:29] Jesus was full of grace and truth
[11:32] right so Paul's just emphasizing the
[11:34] grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
[11:37] in other words Jesus had favor on you
[11:39] that you didn't deserve
[11:41] Hallelujah Jesus had favor on you you
[11:44] didn't deserve it but I sure believe you
[11:46] accept it praise God Amen I didn't
[11:49] deserve it I don't deserve it but I know
[11:50] he gave it to me praise God
[11:52] because I've received it I've I've
[11:54] received the gift praise God and I'm
[11:56] enjoying the gift that God has given me
[11:58] free salvation Hallelujah
[12:01] free Deliverance amen I'm delivered from
[12:03] my sins Hallelujah
[12:05] that's a reality Church
[12:08] and by Grace the Bible said Jesus tasted
[12:10] death for every man by Grace he did that
[12:13] that was Hebrews 2 9. you want to pull
[12:15] that up on Hebrews 2 9. Grace made him
[12:19] take the cross for you brother Austin
[12:20] Grace in other words Jesus went to give
[12:23] you a favor he wanted to do you a favor
[12:25] that you didn't deserve sister who that
[12:28] you didn't deserve I didn't deserve it
[12:30] but Jesus loved you so he wanted to show
[12:32] you Grace amen I love it amen we see
[12:35] Jesus it was made a little lower than
[12:37] the angels for the suffering of death
[12:38] cry with Glory now that he by the grace
[12:40] of God
[12:42] should taste death for every member in
[12:44] bride of Christ Fellowship
[12:46] and Living Waters Tabernacle he takes a
[12:49] death for you sister Emma praise God his
[12:52] grace did that Hallelujah the Bible said
[12:54] he endured the cross because the joy
[12:56] that was set before him amen The Joy
[12:59] where Jesus can sit in heaven tonight
[13:01] and Jesus the Bible said your worship is
[13:03] a sweet smelling savior unto him
[13:06] think about all the different churches
[13:07] around the world brothers that are
[13:09] worshiping God tonight it's worship it's
[13:11] incense coming up those prayers are
[13:13] coming up and Jesus Jesus smells it
[13:16] spiritually he rejoices in it in other
[13:18] words you're giving an acceptable
[13:20] offering of Jesus and Jesus Delights in
[13:22] your worship praise God
[13:24] but by Grace he takes a death so you
[13:27] didn't have to
[13:28] the death of the cross
[13:30] if God dairies we'll all go to the Grave
[13:32] by the natural way of death but we're
[13:34] here he's talking about the death of
[13:36] punishment the death of the cross the
[13:39] death of a sinner
[13:40] we don't die the death of a sinner the
[13:42] Bible said precious in the sight of the
[13:44] Lord is the death of his Saints amen
[13:46] hallelujah
[13:48] it's not a scary thing death is not a
[13:50] scary thing for believers death is not
[13:52] an awful thing death is a precious thing
[13:55] because the believer gets United with
[13:57] his gracious Heavenly Father
[13:59] with his gracious savior with the
[14:01] communion of the Holy Spirit now he gets
[14:03] a new body and has perfect communion
[14:05] with the Holy Ghost never to sin again
[14:07] amen oh it's beautiful
[14:10] then Paul emphasized the love of God we
[14:13] know John 3 16 for God so loved the
[14:14] world and Romans 8 verses 38 39 explain
[14:18] God's great love cause him to send his
[14:20] son to die for our salvation
[14:23] and in Romans 8 Paul has 10 things that
[14:26] cannot separate us from the love of God
[14:27] can we pull it up there let's go to
[14:29] Romans 8 I just thought we'll preach
[14:30] that here tonight I don't think I'm
[14:31] going to finish this chapter I'm gonna
[14:32] have to keep going I never can finish
[14:34] when I think I can Romans 8.
[14:43] Romans 8 38 39.
[14:47] yeah just in these verses he lists 10
[14:48] things Brian persuaded that neither
[14:50] death nor life nor angels nor
[14:53] principalities nor powers nor things
[14:55] present nor things to come think about
[14:57] that think about that church anything
[14:59] present now cannot separate you from the
[15:01] love of Christ
[15:03] any trial you're facing tonight it
[15:05] cannot separate you from God's love
[15:08] and anything in the future if time goes
[15:11] on and we go to 2023 or 2025 or 2030 or
[15:15] 2040 or God forbid 2050 2060. or 2070 if
[15:20] time goes on it cannot separate us from
[15:22] the love of Christ amen
[15:24] nothing
[15:26] past present future can separate you
[15:28] from the love of God
[15:31] that's kind of God I want to serve right
[15:32] there nor height nor depth nor any other
[15:34] creature shall be able to separate us
[15:36] from the love of God which is in Christ
[15:38] Jesus our lord so God's love is in
[15:40] Christ
[15:40] well I thought I thought in the Trinity
[15:42] all the Love's in God
[15:44] it's got God God in Christ right that's
[15:47] what the Bible says love of God which is
[15:49] in Christ Jesus so God's love is in
[15:51] Christ Jesus
[15:53] let me leave the Bible
[15:55] see with the with a carnal mind you
[15:56] think God's giving three persons he's
[15:58] not he's showing one he's showing all of
[16:01] his manifestations is one person God is
[16:03] expressing his love in many ways to us
[16:06] Glory
[16:10] see we have communion today and then of
[16:12] course we have communion with the Holy
[16:13] Ghost as that scripture says go to John
[16:15] 14 26 would you write that I'm sorry put
[16:17] it up there sorry not right up there put
[16:18] it up there
[16:20] they're just they're just a special
[16:22] attribute about the Holy Ghost now I
[16:23] believe when we have communion with the
[16:25] Holy Ghost we're actually having them
[16:26] communion with Jesus right I believe
[16:28] we're having communion with the father
[16:29] at the same time praise God
[16:32] because God's spirit is in Jesus praise
[16:34] God
[16:36] with the comforter which is the Holy
[16:37] Ghost so she searched that's what the
[16:39] Holy Ghost is given for if you need
[16:40] comfort you've got to talk about talk to
[16:42] Jesus about it praise God he's there to
[16:44] give you comfort I don't know about you
[16:45] but I had a good dance on Sunday I had
[16:47] the best prayer I've had this week in a
[16:48] long time so I think I need to dance
[16:50] more that's what I think it is I was
[16:53] right to be able to go right to the
[16:54] closet no hindrances you know just write
[16:56] him I thought my I really need to dance
[16:57] more shame on me I should dance more
[16:59] praise God
[17:00] the Comfort which is the Holy Ghost whom
[17:02] the father will send in my name he'll
[17:04] teach you all things if you ever learn
[17:06] anything it was from the Holy Ghost is
[17:08] that what the Bible says
[17:09] Bible says Jesus says if you ever
[17:11] learned anything it's all he goes to
[17:12] taught you that
[17:14] but how many believe the Holy Ghost is
[17:15] not done teaching you
[17:18] now okay see in other words God wants
[17:20] you to learn tonight
[17:22] God wants you to learn on Sunday God
[17:23] wants me to learn we all got to learn
[17:25] praise God we all got to be humble and
[17:27] say teach me more Lord lest I go astray
[17:31] lest I choose the beaten the wrong way
[17:33] the beaten the wrong path right help me
[17:35] to choose the right way
[17:37] and the Holy Ghost will bring all things
[17:39] he remembers whatsoever I've said unto
[17:41] you
[17:42] so that's how you know the Holy Ghost is
[17:44] working he'll bring the words of Jesus I
[17:46] remember that scripture Hallelujah
[17:47] that's right that's what the Bible says
[17:49] at the very moment you need it that's
[17:51] the work of the Holy Spirit praise God
[17:53] amen so see how that verse second
[17:56] Corinthians 13 14 uh the love of God the
[17:58] grace of Jesus love of God and the
[18:00] community of Holy Ghost see how it's all
[18:01] throughout the Bible
[18:02] it's not pointing up three different
[18:04] persons doing three different works it's
[18:06] just different attributes of different
[18:07] manifestations of God
[18:09] okay so don't let a trinitarian ever
[18:11] tell you well that's three persons that
[18:13] never says three persons
[18:15] you got to look more of the scriptures
[18:17] okay I hope that's a help by God's grace
[18:18] I love the Bible don't you I love
[18:20] Coleman through this scripture oh my
[18:21] it's eternal life Hallelujah I love
[18:24] searching and that's right that's what
[18:25] it says here that's yes all goes
[18:27] together one beautiful story
[18:29] now the next section in the book is the
[18:31] is Jesus the Eternal son
[18:35] trinitarians in the athanasian Creed
[18:37] which is a false Creed With Many
[18:39] contradictions in it which I've already
[18:40] preached on
[18:42] they call Jesus the Eternal son
[18:46] the Creed says the father is eternal the
[18:48] son is eternal the Holy Ghost is eternal
[18:51] but the Eternal Sun title is both absent
[18:54] from the Bible and deceiving because it
[18:56] eludes that Jesus and the father
[18:58] eternally existed as separate persons in
[19:00] heaven
[19:02] right the truth is Jesus body did not
[19:05] exist until God God's spirit formed it
[19:08] in Mary's womb
[19:09] so therefore Jesus's body had a
[19:11] beginning but his Spirit did not
[19:14] praise God
[19:16] so that's why the the title Eternal son
[19:19] doesn't work
[19:20] the word son naturally means you had a
[19:23] beginning you came out of something
[19:25] you came from a father but the father is
[19:28] always before the son
[19:30] I mean it's just common sense
[19:32] but these Creeds they lie they insert
[19:35] lies in there in order to deceive people
[19:40] right I love what brother Adam says this
[19:42] is quote according brother Brown quote
[19:44] people talk about Jesus being the
[19:45] Eternal Son of God now isn't that a
[19:47] contradiction whoever heard of a son
[19:49] being eternal sons have Beginnings but
[19:53] what but that which is eternal never had
[19:55] a beginning he is eternal god Jehovah
[19:58] manifested in the flesh
[20:00] end quote Hallelujah Glory
[20:04] so see when they try to say Eternal son
[20:07] they're trying to make a third person
[20:09] like there was always three people up
[20:11] there in heaven that's that's a lie
[20:13] that's wrong
[20:14] the Bible doesn't call
[20:16] Jesus Eternal son
[20:18] okay so we can't add uh to God's word
[20:22] now a famous trinitarian named Rick
[20:24] Warren who he's getting the the longer
[20:27] time goes I say this with love he's
[20:28] getting more and more off the word of
[20:29] God he wrote a good book the
[20:30] purpose-driven life I found two things
[20:32] wrong in it but there could be more
[20:34] but Rick Warren wrote got quote God
[20:36] invites us to enjoy fellowship and
[20:39] friendship with all three persons of the
[20:41] Trinity end quote
[20:43] so trinitarians believe you've got to be
[20:45] friends with the Father and Son and Holy
[20:48] Ghost now what if you don't treat them
[20:49] all good I mean which one you giving the
[20:51] most time to see how that would cause
[20:53] some problems
[20:55] mostly people just talk to Jesus right
[20:58] what about the father and the Holy Ghost
[21:00] right everybody you know most churches
[21:02] talk about Jesus and pray to Jesus yeah
[21:04] that's good
[21:06] but if there's three you got to pray to
[21:08] now you really gotta really gotta divide
[21:09] up your time Faithfully
[21:12] right he says you need to be friends
[21:14] with all three persons oh my goodness
[21:18] this is found nowhere in scripture in
[21:20] fact it's the opposite Isaiah Ezekiel
[21:22] and John had Fellowship when they went
[21:24] to heaven they only had fellowship with
[21:26] one person amen hallelujah
[21:29] Ezekiel saw him as a wheel within the
[21:32] middle of a wheel praise God Hallelujah
[21:35] Glory Daniel Psalm as the Ancient of
[21:38] Days Hallelujah one man interested in
[21:41] white with hair like white that's the
[21:42] same one John Saul praise God
[21:45] wasn't talking with three he talked
[21:46] Jesus he saw Jesus but then he saw
[21:49] angels and different ones and Angelic
[21:51] hosts and and uh different ones in
[21:53] heaven that he saw he saw those Four and
[21:55] Twenty Elders Hallelujah
[21:57] but there's only one throne and there's
[21:59] only one person sitting on the throne
[22:02] see
[22:05] thank God we don't have the pressure of
[22:07] fellowshipping with three different gods
[22:09] no they'll never say Gods but their
[22:11] definition makes it three Gods we've
[22:13] already been through that they'll never
[22:14] say I believe in three Gods it's always
[22:15] three persons but a person has to be
[22:17] individual from somebody else if not the
[22:20] word person makes no sense
[22:22] the very word person means I'm someone
[22:24] separate than another person I'm a
[22:26] separate being I'm not the same
[22:28] Hallelujah
[22:31] oh my help us Lord
[22:35] and then uh
[22:39] uh Rick Warren says this quote the
[22:42] Trinity is God's relationship to himself
[22:44] now look at that God's relationship to
[22:46] himself
[22:48] can't even understand that
[22:51] I have a relationship with myself
[22:54] Jesse how are you this morning I'm
[22:55] pretty tired oh let me cheer you up a
[22:57] little bit can I show you I mean that's
[22:59] ridiculous
[23:00] are you hungry Jess yeah could you make
[23:02] me some eggs I'm sure I'll go make you
[23:03] something
[23:04] I have a relationship with myself
[23:07] you see how these this is insanity
[23:10] God needs to have a relationship with
[23:12] himself
[23:14] Mercy it doesn't make any sense I I
[23:17] haven't even finished the quote he says
[23:19] God quote God God has always existed in
[23:21] loving relationship to himself so he's
[23:23] never been lonely he didn't need a
[23:25] family
[23:27] so God that's the end of the quote
[23:30] God's never been lonely because he
[23:32] always had two other persons to
[23:33] Fellowship
[23:35] and this guy's one of the leaders in the
[23:37] Evangelical world
[23:39] remember when he had remember when he
[23:40] had the debates between John McCain and
[23:42] Barack Obama does anybody remember that
[23:43] I won the oldest one
[23:46] it's down here tonight and he might have
[23:48] been watching he's in gotten anyway you
[23:49] know but I remember when he had those
[23:50] debates and they debated about marriage
[23:52] and both said We Believe marriage is one
[23:54] man and one woman
[23:55] by their by their trickery they got
[23:57] Obama in there they thought he was a
[24:00] conservative turned out to be one of the
[24:01] worst Presidents of all time
[24:03] supporting the homosexual agenda all the
[24:05] corruption Hillary Clinton everything
[24:07] like that
[24:08] but what did it the church the church
[24:10] brought these guys together that's the
[24:12] false Church
[24:14] but this guy said God wasn't alone
[24:16] because he had two other people to
[24:17] fellowship with
[24:19] now it's true God has never been lonely
[24:22] but God doesn't need anything really go
[24:24] to acts 17 25 God really doesn't need
[24:26] anything
[24:27] this is all by grace
[24:30] God does not have a need of anything
[24:34] but God does have a plan thank God and
[24:38] you're a part of it Hallelujah
[24:39] okay say like this you're the good part
[24:41] of it
[24:42] you're the positive part of it
[24:44] Hallelujah
[24:45] you're a vessel unto honor you're a
[24:48] vessel unto Grace praise God
[24:51] you're not a vessel to dishonor
[24:53] but your life will honor Jesus Christ
[24:56] neither is worship with men's hands as
[24:58] though he needed anything it's not like
[24:59] God needs your worship
[25:02] but God wants you to express yourself to
[25:04] him
[25:06] seeing he giveth life to all breath and
[25:09] all things see God doesn't need really
[25:12] anything
[25:13] but God is giving us free more agency to
[25:16] let us choose whatever we want and if we
[25:18] want salvation he'll give it to us amen
[25:21] and he'll teach us how to serve him and
[25:23] love him but he doesn't really need it
[25:26] he doesn't have to have it to exist he's
[25:27] not like well I sure hope Jesse keeps
[25:29] preaching you're loving God because I
[25:30] surely want his Fellowship I I really
[25:32] need it
[25:34] it's a different kind of a love praise
[25:36] God it's a different kind of power
[25:38] it's a different kind of level it's far
[25:40] above our level
[25:42] like we think we need this money or we
[25:44] need this relationship or we've got to
[25:46] have this or we no it's true we need it
[25:47] but God doesn't need anything praise God
[25:50] so what has this all done it all
[25:52] magnifies the grace of God
[25:54] he's given us a chance aren't you glad
[25:56] for a chance to serve God aren't you
[25:58] glad he showed you his truth aren't you
[26:00] glad he pointed you in the right
[26:01] direction praise God he didn't leave you
[26:03] alone he didn't let you just wander
[26:05] around but Jesus the great Shepherd left
[26:07] the 99 and went after you amen
[26:10] hallelujah praise God
[26:13] he went and sought you out you beloved
[26:15] amen he went and sought to you praise
[26:17] God he never forsook you praise God he
[26:19] wanted to show you his love so that you
[26:21] in return would lovingly serve him
[26:23] praise God
[26:24] and make himself known
[26:26] Hallelujah but God doesn't need anything
[26:28] he didn't need two people to fellowship
[26:30] with
[26:32] hey daddy father
[26:33] you want to spend some time together
[26:34] today
[26:36] never actually wasn't a day yet
[26:37] there was no there's no there's no sun
[26:39] there's no moon there eternally existed
[26:42] together
[26:44] sweet Dove can you Roost on my shoulder
[26:46] and can you imagine Jesus and can you
[26:48] Roost on my shoulder can I can you coo
[26:49] in my ear can I pet you
[26:51] I need some fellowship
[26:53] that's ridiculous
[26:55] we laughed Emma laughter I laughed
[26:58] nonsense
[27:00] this is paganism
[27:03] polytheism
[27:04] try theism
[27:06] three Gods by love Isaiah 44 24. pull
[27:09] that up there I love this I just like to
[27:10] nail this down
[27:12] put it right there and say this is what
[27:13] I believe praise God
[27:15] Isaiah 45 20 more
[27:19] thus saith the Lord thy Redeemer and he
[27:21] that formed thee in the womb see the
[27:23] same one that formed you in the womb I
[27:24] am the Lord that maketh all things that
[27:26] stretches forth the heavens alone alone
[27:28] let's all say alone can we alone to the
[27:30] same one that stretched out the heavens
[27:32] is the same one that formed you in your
[27:34] mother's womb praise God hallelujah
[27:36] praise God
[27:38] that spreads abroad the Earth by myself
[27:42] any help
[27:44] well if the Holy Ghost formed Jesus in
[27:47] the womb then he's the Holy Ghost was a
[27:50] separate person than the father
[27:52] well then the Holy Ghost formed the
[27:53] Earth and not the father see how this is
[27:54] so confusing now you gotta you gotta you
[27:57] gotta play with all these scriptures you
[27:58] got to search around it doesn't make any
[28:00] sense
[28:01] no there's only one God hallelujah
[28:03] and he's the one he proved that he did
[28:06] creation all by himself one person not
[28:09] three and like I showed you last week
[28:10] Church
[28:12] eventually they're going to kill over
[28:13] this
[28:14] the transares will want to kill anyone
[28:16] who descends over this topic
[28:18] yes they will
[28:21] that's what they all say and all these
[28:22] guys right now All These Guys these
[28:23] trinitarian guys I watch them on YouTube
[28:25] they all they all want to basically uh
[28:27] reject TD Jakes now he's not a faithful
[28:29] preacher he's a Prosperity preacher but
[28:31] they want to kiss in the creeds
[28:34] I'm not the heretic they're the Heretics
[28:36] Glory
[28:39] Hallelujah
[28:43] if God has two other persons then he has
[28:45] to manage
[28:46] of multiple personalities disorder
[28:49] he's got to manage that
[28:51] make sure he doesn't get a disorder
[28:52] making sure he's fellowships with both
[28:55] other persons
[28:56] right God himself God the father has to
[28:59] make sure he fellowships with the Son
[29:00] and the Holy Ghost oh it's nonsense
[29:06] Hallelujah
[29:08] now Church there is there is some truth
[29:10] too we were chosen as a pope Ephesians 1
[29:13] 4. we were Eternal in one sense that we
[29:16] were in the mind of God in other words
[29:18] God had a thought about you before the
[29:21] foundation of the world
[29:23] and I'll say this God had a thought
[29:24] about this the body of Jesus Christ
[29:26] before the body of Jesus Christ of
[29:28] course was formed in the womb of Mary
[29:30] that was an eternal thought of God
[29:32] because the Bible says according hath
[29:34] chosen Us in where he chosen Us in him
[29:37] in his mind
[29:39] before the foundation of the world
[29:41] before there's a world there's a thought
[29:43] in there about the seven Church ages and
[29:45] at the very end there were some
[29:47] Believers filled with the Holy Ghost and
[29:49] that thought was about you
[29:50] Glory you weren't the lukewarm thought
[29:53] you weren't the cold thought you were
[29:55] the hot thought amen
[29:57] Hallelujah somebody ought to be saying
[29:58] amen praise God he had a thought about
[30:01] you praise God
[30:03] and that was his thought of choosing
[30:05] them in Me by four knowledge I know what
[30:07] they'll choose they'll choose to be hot
[30:09] they'll choose to be real sons and
[30:10] daughters of God they'll choose to
[30:12] believe all the word of God
[30:14] and I place them at that time and place
[30:16] for a particular season
[30:19] Hallelujah
[30:22] so see God had thoughts but then he
[30:24] expressed them
[30:25] good now so see you're a thought of God
[30:27] and I'll pull up II Corinthians 6 16.
[30:30] there is some truth that the sun was an
[30:32] eternal thought of God but the son
[30:35] didn't exist as a separate person
[30:38] outside of God the Father
[30:41] the body of Jesus was a thought God in
[30:43] other words God was thinking I'm going
[30:44] to manifest myself in flesh at some
[30:46] point
[30:47] but there wasn't like
[30:49] I'm going to put you in flesh one day
[30:50] okay Holy Ghost I'm going to send you in
[30:52] the hearts of all the saints one day he
[30:54] wasn't talking to two other people
[30:56] it was all honest thoughts so just
[30:58] picture one man one God one God all
[31:01] knowing all things and he was all by
[31:02] himself but he had all these thoughts
[31:04] and you were one of them
[31:05] Hallelujah he had plans for you praise
[31:08] God he had plans for you and you and you
[31:10] had your plans for all of us praise God
[31:12] plans for good and not evil praise God
[31:16] that's what the Bible says to give you
[31:17] an expected End Amen you can know what
[31:20] to expect the blessings of God the grace
[31:22] of God hallelujah amen
[31:25] Hallelujah
[31:28] ask me what keeps me young I think it's
[31:29] running after all these kids preaching
[31:31] so hard I think that's what keeps me
[31:32] going
[31:35] what agreement at the temple of God with
[31:37] idols
[31:39] what can the what can the real house of
[31:41] God what Fellowship can our church have
[31:43] with Catholic Church that have Idols
[31:44] there's no there's no agreement
[31:47] for ye are the Temple of the Living God
[31:48] as God has said what did God say before
[31:50] in his thoughts I will dwell in brother
[31:53] Austin
[31:54] I would dwell in of our sisters I will
[31:58] dwell that was his thoughts he had all
[31:59] these thoughts and he said one day I'm
[32:01] going to dwell in them
[32:04] see so you you have an eternal aspect to
[32:07] you the thought of you
[32:09] the thought praise God
[32:12] that thought of you is eternal because
[32:14] that's where he chose you glory
[32:16] he didn't choose you in 1990 when you
[32:18] were born or me 1980 he chose you in his
[32:21] mind before the foundation wrote he was
[32:24] thinking about you way before you
[32:26] thought about him amen
[32:28] that ought to comfort you tonight praise
[32:30] God before he even surrendered to him he
[32:33] was already planning your ways and
[32:34] planning your repentance planning your
[32:36] baptism planting The Filling of the Holy
[32:38] Ghost amen
[32:40] he already had it all planned out
[32:42] Hallelujah before he even thought of him
[32:44] he was thinking good things about you
[32:47] thank God Amen
[32:50] you're an eternal thought of God but
[32:52] then one day he said I'm going to dwell
[32:54] in her
[32:55] I'm going to dwell in him I'm glad he's
[32:57] living to me praise God Jesus oh he's
[33:00] living me Hallelujah
[33:01] and I'll walk in them I'll walk in their
[33:04] shoes
[33:06] and I will be their God
[33:08] they shall be my people Church you are
[33:10] the people of God

[33:39] offerings over the seas
[33:41] to help out the hungry and the poor
[33:43] God's Own people that God is walking in
[33:48] realize that church when you're when
[33:49] you're helping people it's actually God
[33:51] walking in your shoes

[34:33] there's an eternal aspect so you are a
[34:36] manifested thought of God
[34:38] do you have an eternal quality to you
[34:43] and then one day you were to be
[34:44] expressed in a flesh body so God can
[34:47] walk in you and then God can have
[34:49] fellowship with you
[34:52] I will walk in them I will be their God
[34:55] and they will be my people oh Hallelujah

[35:11] what is there anything bothering you you
[35:13] need to talk to me about anything
[35:13] anything you want to share with me that
[35:15] I can I
[35:16] can I can take that load off your
[35:18] shoulders
[35:19] any burdens you want to share with me
[35:20] that I can take that's how God is he
[35:23] wants to fellowship with you he knew he
[35:25] already knew all about it but he's just
[35:27] waiting for you to show him some
[35:29] fellowship
[35:31] thank God thank God Amen Hallelujah
[35:36] now just to balance this out
[35:40] the invisible father did have fellowship
[35:43] with the son once the son became visible
[35:47] that's called the logos
[35:49] but it always wasn't that way
[35:52] right in the beginning God said let
[35:53] there be light that light was the light
[35:55] of God so before there was nothing there
[35:57] was absolutely nothing it was just it
[35:59] was all God
[36:00] but then God had a manifestation of
[36:02] light time space and matter all came in
[36:04] existence at one time and God had made a
[36:07] light and now there's a son
[36:08] something came out of the nothingness or
[36:10] out of the fullness of God something
[36:12] visible came out of the fullness of God
[36:13] and that was the son
[36:16] and now the Bible says that's when God
[36:18] and the son started having Fellowship
[36:22] that's what the Bible says so uh John 17
[36:24] it's uh
[36:26] 17 5 and 24. okay just left okay no
[36:29] problem I'll put up in the Bible that's
[36:31] okay
[36:32] 75 I'm not gonna be too much longer
[36:36] if you want to you can that's fine oh
[36:38] thank you huh John 17 5 I'm gonna get it
[36:40] in 24. and now oh Father glorify thou me
[36:43] with thine own self with the glory which
[36:45] I had with thee before the world was oh
[36:48] so this is where the trinitarians
[36:49] stumble
[36:51] see this is the scripture they
[36:53] misinterpret oh see there always was
[36:55] father uh Young Man and Dove no there
[36:58] wasn't always that
[36:59] there's nothing there's not even that in
[37:01] the Bible
[37:02] it's only God
[37:04] God and then a visible a theophany or a
[37:07] visible logos whether it's fire or looks
[37:10] like a man in heaven the Bible says
[37:13] so say so see there was an eternal
[37:15] quality
[37:17] Jesus or God had a thought about himself
[37:19] become miserable the son or the logos
[37:22] and then when that logos was come out of
[37:24] the mind of God then God was moving in
[37:27] that fire god is moving in that light
[37:28] and now the Bible said they can have
[37:30] Fellowship
[37:32] the manifestation with the invisible God
[37:35] praise God
[37:37] that's in the Bible
[37:38] 1720
[37:40] 25
[37:40] or 25 no 24.
[37:43] father I will that they also whom thou
[37:45] Hast given me be with me where I am that
[37:48] they may be hold my glory which thou has
[37:50] given me for thou loveth me what before
[37:53] the foundation of the world
[37:56] so now we got two things before the
[37:57] foundation world you were chosen before
[37:59] the foundation world and God loved his
[38:01] son the logos amen
[38:03] before the foundation of the world amen
[38:05] hallelujah praise God you are chosen in
[38:08] him before the foundation world when God
[38:10] loved his son
[38:12] you were chosen to him we're getting
[38:14] some deep Waters here Teresa like the
[38:16] Bible said verse it was at the knees
[38:17] then it was at the waist and then it was
[38:19] out my head that's in the Book of
[38:21] Ezekiel you just keep in deeper the
[38:24] things of God hallelujah take me deeper
[38:27] amen hallelujah take me deeper Jesus
[38:32] so first there was God and then God said
[38:34] I'm going to start making myself towards
[38:35] visible towards a man and the first step
[38:38] was a light and then God the invisible
[38:40] went in that light and had fellowship
[38:42] with that light
[38:43] and that's the that's the glory they
[38:45] shared before the foundation world and
[38:47] then remember that light that light that
[38:48] logos then the logos spoke and said let
[38:52] there be let there be a Earth let there
[38:53] be a sun Let There Be sea creatures all
[38:55] the creation of God
[38:57] out of the logos
[38:59] see church I ain't scared of one verse
[39:01] in the Bible
[39:03] there's not one verse in the Bible that
[39:04] offends me
[39:06] that I that I don't say well I don't
[39:08] believe that I believe everything in the
[39:10] Bible
[39:11] I might not understand everything in the
[39:12] Bible
[39:13] sure believe it praise God
[39:16] I believe it
[39:17] and it just takes a little humility
[39:20] to search the scriptures
[39:22] and find the understanding that we need
[39:26] remember the Bible said I mentioned this
[39:27] on Sunday remember the Bible says we
[39:29] must grow in the knowledge of God
[39:31] we must invest significant time in the
[39:33] things of God
[39:36] and that's how we'll grow in the Statue
[39:38] of our perfect man by spending more time
[39:40] with God
[39:41] making God's word our Delight
[39:44] and church we got we got to understand
[39:45] this it's just going to get harder and
[39:47] harder to focus on God as time goes on
[39:51] there's going to be more and more
[39:53] distractions when I was growing up the
[39:55] only distraction I had was a radio
[39:58] now you guys got cell phones
[40:00] there's a lot of Bing ding ding bing
[40:03] bong all day long there's that thing
[40:04] called Bing Bong all day long Bing it's
[40:07] a kid's song in other words on the cell
[40:09] phone getting notifications on the cell
[40:10] phone all day long
[40:12] we had to go to uh the radio we had to
[40:15] go to but now they just carry and
[40:18] there's distractions all day long all
[40:20] God wants is our fellowship
[40:22] praise God
[40:24] the communion of the Holy Ghost
[40:27] that's what he wants in our lives
[40:29] that's
[40:31] that's the that's the the manifestation
[40:33] we're in right now the Holy Ghost
[40:34] manifestation
[40:36] he wants to bring Church the Holy Ghost
[40:38] wants to bring Jesus words to our
[40:40] remembrance
[40:41] so remember them when we're in our
[40:43] houses we remember them on the job we'll
[40:45] remember them right here in church
[40:47] well remember what Jesus said and it
[40:49] will help us in our Christian Journey
[40:51] instead of like this instead of
[40:52] stumbling tripping instead of stumbling
[40:55] over sin the word will come and it'll
[40:57] help us to step over those things
[40:59] so we don't stumble
[41:01] Hallelujah I remember what Jesus said I
[41:04] ain't going to trip I'm going to be very
[41:05] careful I'm going to I'm going to the
[41:06] Bible said walk circumspectly I'm going
[41:09] to walk exactly where I need to go and
[41:10] I'm almost falling all over the place
[41:11] here
[41:13] when you got when you're walking with
[41:15] God when you have Community with the
[41:16] Holy Ghost you're walking in the correct
[41:18] path the right steps God wants you to
[41:20] walk in
[41:22] your communion directs your walk with
[41:23] the Lord
[41:25] your daily communion
[41:28] but God did have fellowship with the son
[41:30] before the foundational world it was the
[41:33] invisible the invisible with the visible
[41:35] light
[41:36] that's the scripture
[41:40] you want to see a beautiful picture of
[41:41] it
[41:42] proverbs 8.
[41:44] verse 22.
[41:50] Proverbs 8 22 a beautiful picture
[41:53] I hope this don't stop with your church
[41:55] Proverbs 8 22 but I believe it's in the
[41:57] Bible
[42:01] this is why Jesus would say
[42:05] share with me the glory or give me the
[42:08] glory that you share with me before the
[42:09] foundation of the world
[42:13] Proverbs 8 22 and I want to have it
[42:16] right here before me because it's a long
[42:17] what I got right here
[42:19] the Lord possessed me in the beginning
[42:21] of his way before his works of old I was
[42:23] set up from Everlasting from the
[42:24] beginning or or ever that Earth was
[42:27] who's this this is Jesus
[42:29] before the Earth ever was Jesus was
[42:31] there
[42:32] as a light
[42:34] as the logos
[42:35] as a theophany the church said
[42:38] theophany God had a theophany
[42:41] a spiritual body and that spiritual body
[42:44] was the sun it came out of the invisible
[42:48] when there was no depths I was brought
[42:51] forth
[42:52] when there were no fountains abounding
[42:54] with water
[42:55] before the mountains were settled before
[42:57] the hills was I brought forth oh my
[42:59] goodness
[43:01] Hallelujah
[43:03] well as yet he had not made the Earth
[43:05] nor the fields or the highest part of
[43:08] the Dust of the world when he prepared
[43:10] the heavens I was there
[43:13] this is speaking of God's spirit of
[43:15] wisdom this is speaking of the sun
[43:16] manifestation
[43:18] when he set a compass upon the face of
[43:21] the earth now look at that he put a
[43:22] compass on the face of a compass
[43:25] north south east and west
[43:26] when God put that that uh principle into
[43:30] place directions
[43:32] gravity magnetism Jesus said I was there
[43:37] Hallelujah
[43:39] somebody hope not
[43:41] when he established the clouds above
[43:43] when he strengthened The Fountains of
[43:45] the deep when he gave to the sea is
[43:47] decree that the water should not pass
[43:48] his commandment when he appoint the
[43:50] foundation of the earth then was I
[43:52] bought then was I by him as one brought
[43:55] up with him
[43:57] and I was daily his Delight rejoicing
[44:00] always before him
[44:05] rejoicing in the habitable part of his
[44:07] Earth
[44:08] and my Delights were with the sons of
[44:11] men
[44:12] so the Bible says Jesus's Spirit was
[44:15] there before the worlds remained before
[44:17] there ever was a mountain Jesus was
[44:19] Jesus was there
[44:20] the spirit of God
[44:22] before there was Oceans Jesus was there
[44:27] and when the first day of creation was
[44:29] there Jesus
[44:31] Jesus when the Earth was all finished
[44:32] guess who was there Jesus
[44:35] praise God Amen
[44:38] church and if he was there before all
[44:40] these things don't you think he's still
[44:42] here today to meet your needs praise God
[44:45] if he was there when everything was
[44:47] formed and if he could see all the great
[44:49] depths and all the great compass and and
[44:51] all the great uh dimensions of the Earth
[44:53] and the moon and all the things all the
[44:55] glory of the universe don't you think
[44:57] he's still here today to minister to you
[44:59] and have fellowship with you
[45:01] how many believe that
[45:04] Daley was Jesus God's Delight
[45:11] in other words the invisible
[45:13] was rejoicing in the visible
[45:14] manifestation
[45:16] the father was moving through the sun
[45:18] right
[45:20] and the Bible said I was as one brought
[45:22] him brought up with him I was always
[45:24] rejoicing before him if Jesus can
[45:26] Rejoice before the father how about the
[45:28] other children of God
[45:29] hallelujah hallelujah
[45:32] that's why Sunday I was a good day I'll
[45:34] tell you that was a good day for me
[45:36] rejoicing before the Lord amen that's
[45:39] what Jesus did before the foundation of
[45:40] the world praise God
[45:42] at the foundation world the low gospel
[45:45] is rejoicing before the invisible father
[45:47] oh may God help us to catch when we see
[45:49] God creating things in our lives amen
[45:51] when we see God moving things in our
[45:53] lives when we see God doing great things
[45:55] we ought to rejoice as well praise God
[45:57] ah just like the children of Israel
[45:59] praise God when they say God when they
[46:00] saw God working through their lives and
[46:02] making a highway through the sea praise
[46:04] God and bringing them through the sea
[46:06] when they saw their task Masters drown
[46:08] when they saw deliverance and victory
[46:10] they danced before the Lord they Rejoice
[46:12] before their father we ought to rejoice
[46:14] when God Moves In Our Lives hallelujah
[46:16] amen hallelujah
[46:18] because that's what Jesus did
[46:21] so when so when I Dance I mean like
[46:23] Jesus that's exactly right praise God
[46:25] hallelujah when you rejoice when you
[46:28] shout when you smile when you cry when
[46:30] You Weep when you glorify God you're
[46:32] being just like Jesus amen Hallelujah
[46:35] Rejoice him before the father let's
[46:37] stand our feet praise
[46:39] God I'm not going to finish
[46:42] Hallelujah what a balance it is
[46:44] musicians you can come
[46:46] what a balance it is
[46:48] I'm gonna make a video on this here
[46:49] pretty soon
[46:51] Trinity is so close but so far away
[46:55] do we understand that
[46:57] it's so close
[46:59] the sun was the Delight of the father
[47:02] before the foundation of the world
[47:06] in other words God looked down his son
[47:07] said I'm so proud of him
[47:11] and he's like Daddy look at me
[47:15] that's what the Bible says
[47:17] I was daily rejoicing
[47:21] then Jesus prayed said give me the glory
[47:24] like the glory we had before the
[47:25] foundation
[47:28] but it wasn't an eternal son neither is
[47:30] there an eternal death
[47:32] but at one point the sun came out of the
[47:35] father
[47:36] and now God could have fellowship with
[47:38] his son
[47:40] and don't stop there one day you came
[47:42] out of your father
[47:44] I'm not talking about the natural that's
[47:45] true too I'm talking about the spiritual
[47:48] Hallelujah one day God breathed the
[47:50] breath of life into your soul
[47:53] and you became a living soul and then
[47:56] you were birthed out of your mother and
[47:58] then God showed you his Mercy he showed
[48:00] you his love why so you rejoiced before
[48:02] him
[48:04] so you would love your father oh I'm
[48:06] getting this I'm getting hold of you I'm
[48:07] getting righteous Indonesian here
[48:08] tonight I might have to dance around
[48:09] here tonight Hallelujah glory amen
[48:13] he was always rejoicing before God
[48:15] how should we act towards our father
[48:18] we ought to Rejoice before God as well
[48:21] because God saw us we were in his mind
[48:24] and he knew we'd come forth in this time
[48:26] and God created us to have Battleship
[48:28] with him
[48:29] Tony appreciate his Fellowship praise
[48:31] God
[48:32] that's what God wants church he wants
[48:34] your fellowship
[48:35] in other words he said seek ye first my
[48:37] fellowship
[48:39] and all these things will be added unto
[48:41] you how do you believe that
[48:42] if you see God's Fellowship there's my
[48:44] 45 minutes
[48:45] 45 minutes
[48:49] if you seek my fellowship first I'll
[48:52] give you everything oh my goodness I'll
[48:53] give you everything you needed

[49:14] can I just Rejoice before you a little
[49:15] bit now
[49:22] you've been gracious and merciful
[49:29] that's exactly what Christ did rejoicing
[49:31] always for him let's bar heads here
[49:38] in church don't forget to remember in
[49:40] the book of well in the gospels Bob said
[49:43] Jesus rejoices and went up to heaven
[49:45] said I thank me
[49:55] and just Rejoice hear that same
[49:56] rejoicing

[50:00] foundation of the world

[50:08] Hallelujah this is the beautiful things
[50:10] that come out of these you know I never
[50:11] I didn't see this coming in the service
[50:12] but out of a godhead sermon you think oh
[50:14] that's just kind of
[50:17] but out of this comes such a beautiful
[50:18] thought
[50:19] why are we rejoicing before our father
[50:21] or if we are we can say praise God I can
[50:24] Rejoice before my father
[50:27] because there's nothing in the past in
[50:29] the present or the future there's no
[50:31] principality there's no power there's no
[50:33] creature that can separate me from the
[50:35] love of God
