[0:00] 1, 2, and 3. And we can read verse three
[0:02] together.
[0:19] So I'll read one and two and then we can
[0:21] read three together. Though I speak with
[0:23] the tongues of men and angels and have
[0:25] not charity, I'm become as sounding
[0:28] brass or a tinkling symbol. Now, anyone
[0:31] with children, Vang would know, and
[0:33] Naomi, if anybody buys them one of those
[0:35] music sets,
[0:37] they got a drum, they got symbols in
[0:39] there. Any parent knows what that sounds
[0:43] like,
[0:45] right? All my children have done that.
[0:47] Clash, clang, blang, blang, bomb, boom.
[0:50] and you're like, "Oh, Lord have mercy."
[0:53] I want you to keep in mind that's what
[0:55] it's like when someone uses the gift of
[0:59] God in their life, but it's without
[1:01] love. It's just like, "Oh, why did it
[1:03] have to happen? Why? Oh, why does this
[1:05] have to happen to me?" You know, I'm
[1:06] talking about the the the noise of
[1:08] symbols, but that's spiritually. Why
[1:11] does that have to happen in the church
[1:14] when a gift is used without love? How
[1:16] many would say love is important? Amen.
[1:20] &gt;&gt; Verse two. And though I have the gift of
[1:22] prophecy and understand all mysteries.
[1:24] Now, I preached already to you on that.
[1:26] This applies to us. We're one of the few
[1:29] generations that say we know all the
[1:31] mysteries of God that are called
[1:33] mysteries. We don't understand every
[1:36] single thing. We're not infinite. Only
[1:38] Jesus Christ is infinite. But as far as
[1:41] a Bible calling something a mystery, God
[1:44] has revealed it in this last day. The
[1:46] mystery of God is finished. So this
[1:49] tells us though our church can
[1:51] understand everything if we don't have
[1:52] love doesn't help us one bit.
[1:55] [snorts]
[1:57] Hallelujah. And all knowledge and though
[1:59] I have all faith so that I could remove
[2:01] mountains and have not charity, I am
[2:04] nothing.
[2:06] &gt;&gt; And the last verse, let's read this
[2:07] together. Ready? One, two, three. And
[2:10] though I bestow all my goods to feed the
[2:13] poor, and though I give my body to be
[2:16] burned, and have not charity, it
[2:19] profitth me nothing. May God add the
[2:22] blessing to the reading of his word. You
[2:23] can be seated by God's grace.
[2:33] So I have some slides here in case
[2:35] you'll try to get to this today. I'm not
[2:36] not sure how far I'll get. Uh, I'm gonna
[2:39] have to preach a couple sermons just on
[2:40] this chapter. This is one of the most uh
[2:42] fantastic chapters.
[2:44] I mean, I can say that about a lot of
[2:46] chapters, but that's just how it is.
[2:47] That's how God's word is. It just it's
[2:49] hard to it's hard to explain how
[2:51] fantastic and amazing these chapters
[2:52] are.
[2:55] Pardon me.
[2:58] [snorts]
[3:05] Just want to make sure I got everything.
[3:14] Hallelujah.
[3:19] Okay.
[3:20] So, uh I got the wrong text. I didn't
[3:22] update that slide. So, pardon me. I was
[3:24] going to do 13 1-3. Um just again
[3:27] briefly, we looked at the believers
[3:28] standing in grace. If any need if any
[3:30] church needed grace, it was this church.
[3:32] Praise God. Brother said they were
[3:34] always constantly in trouble with God.
[3:38] Uh they were divided on who was the best
[3:41] preacher or no preacher, just Jesus,
[3:44] right? I just play the tapes or I just
[3:45] listen to brother Brandham or something
[3:47] like that. Uh I just sit home and just
[3:49] read my Bible. Right? The same type of
[3:51] idea. That's the wrong idea.
[3:54] Brother Brandham said, "How can you uh
[3:56] say you're a Christian and deny the body
[3:58] of Jesus Christ? How can you say you
[4:00] love Jesus Christ and reject the body of
[4:03] Jesus Christ? You can't. You can't stay
[4:05] at home and uh not gather to church and
[4:08] say you're part of the body of Christ.
[4:11] Hallelujah. It's so simple, right?
[4:15] Uh and then there was sexual immorality
[4:17] in the church. And then Paul explained
[4:19] how you have to sanctify your body and
[4:21] then your marriage must be sanctified.
[4:23] He dealt with Christian liberties like
[4:25] meat, wine,
[4:27] uh, and gave them warnings about being
[4:30] careful how much freedom you take as a
[4:32] Christian.
[4:36] So like I saw the or I talked to
[4:38] somebody recently. Now think of this
[4:39] church, be careful how much freedom you
[4:41] have. You know, I talked to a brother
[4:42] and it really offended him that uh
[4:45] somebody in their church, not our
[4:47] church, but somebody in this brother's
[4:48] church
[4:50] on Saturday night posts on social media,
[4:52] oh, I'm going to this race like to watch
[4:55] Cars race or something like some some
[4:57] race like race, some motorcycle race,
[4:59] some type of race. And yet the next
[5:01] morning they don't go to church and
[5:02] they're not sick or anything like that.
[5:04] Like that's that's taken liberty way too
[5:06] far.
[5:07] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm too tired. I was at the the
[5:09] race too late. You've stopped running
[5:11] the Christian race. You're involved in
[5:14] the wrong race. If racing motorcycles or
[5:18] bikes or cars is more important and gets
[5:20] you more excited than the Christian
[5:22] race, you're backslid or not even saved,
[5:25] &gt;&gt; right? You're backslided if you're not
[5:26] born again. I don't see how born again
[5:28] person could do that. Right? But you've
[5:32] missed the real race, the Christian
[5:33] race. We're supposed to lay aside
[5:35] anything that would hinder us, right?
[5:37] &gt;&gt; And run the race. So we got to be
[5:38] careful with our liberties that we
[5:40] enjoy.
[5:43] &gt;&gt; And then we looked at headship. It's
[5:44] shown by hair length. Uh and then the
[5:48] Lord's supper, how important that is.
[5:50] Brother Brandham said it's a minor.
[5:52] Communion is a minor, but there are
[5:55] curses attached. If people don't judge
[5:57] the body of Jesus Christ, they get weak,
[5:59] sickly, or die. Those are the three
[6:01] things. If people take communion the
[6:03] wrong way, they get weak, they get sick,
[6:05] or they die. So Paul warns them with
[6:08] that and then we looked at the nine
[6:10] spiritual gifts and now we're looking at
[6:11] charity by God's grace. Um
[6:15] now as we get ready to read 1
[6:17] Corinthians 13, keep this in mind. Love
[6:20] the the the love of God was the solution
[6:22] to all these problems.
[6:24] &gt;&gt; These are problems we all go through
[6:26] maybe at times. You know we all face
[6:28] these problems at some point, right?
[6:30] Division, pride, sexual sin, uh right?
[6:34] angry with people, wanting to get
[6:36] revenge on people, right? You don't have
[6:38] to say amen. You can just say, "Ouch."
[6:39] You know, so sometimes you get you want
[6:42] revenge on people, right? Uh drunkenness
[6:45] or finan money, right? Money or lust of
[6:49] the flesh, we'd say, drunkenness,
[6:50] cigarettes, pot, whatever it might be.
[6:55] And then uh just out of control like uh
[6:58] spiritual gifts like fanaticism.
[7:00] Well, I had this dream and I had this I
[7:03] had this revelation or something like
[7:04] that and we go overboard on it,
[7:07] &gt;&gt; right? Or this brother my he just
[7:09] preached this and I I've had people tell
[7:11] me that they text me like, "Oh, this
[7:12] preacher and there's a certain preacher
[7:14] that's getting real popular right now
[7:15] from South Africa." And I've had these
[7:17] people say, "My this preacher and and so
[7:19] on fire and all they do, they just binge
[7:20] watch all these preacher sermons and I
[7:22] just watch one or I just listen to one
[7:25] and I and I detect like eight or nine
[7:27] lies coming in there like you're greater
[7:31] like Jesus in you is greater than when
[7:32] Jesus was born of a virgin." Remember I
[7:34] went through those a couple weeks ago.
[7:36] just insane things
[7:39] and right it's just this you know they
[7:42] they enjoy somebody's gift or he's very
[7:44] charismatic or my he can preach the
[7:45] house down or he can just he can put his
[7:48] words together never spits you know he
[7:50] can he never he never stutters boy he
[7:54] can just lay everything out and people
[7:55] get overzealous on a gift but they fail
[7:59] to spit out the seeds that are coming in
[8:01] that cherry pie right so they're
[8:03] swallowing down cherry p cherry seeds
[8:06] right choking
[8:07] on the word of God.
[8:10] And we'll see later that they lacked
[8:11] generosity of any church that should
[8:14] have been generous. It should have been
[8:15] this church because they were a wealthy
[8:17] church. Remember, they even had rich
[8:19] people because that's where they were
[8:19] suing people. They were drunken at the
[8:21] Lord's table. The rich people wouldn't
[8:22] let the poor people eat with them before
[8:24] communion. Now, we don't experience
[8:26] anything like that, but we we uh let's
[8:29] say like this. Let's say the richest
[8:30] people in the church had a feast and
[8:32] they didn't invite the poor people in
[8:33] this church.
[8:35] You know, that would be the equivalent
[8:37] to something like that. Well, we're only
[8:39] inviting the people who give the most
[8:40] tithes. We're not going to invite the
[8:42] people who give little tithes,
[8:44] right? But the people giving little ties
[8:46] might be giving more offerings on the
[8:49] percentage of their income than the rich
[8:51] people given more tithes.
[8:54] Like the widow with the two mites,
[8:56] &gt;&gt; she gave more in percentage than the
[8:59] Pharisees and their thousands of extra
[9:01] dollars that they may have had or we'd
[9:02] say millions, whatever, whatever number
[9:04] you want to give.
[9:06] &gt;&gt; Okay? Now, I didn't that's that's just
[9:07] my notes. I'll get to that. Uh I
[9:09] actually finished that
[9:11] now. Oh, yeah. Uh Scoffield calls this I
[9:14] just want you to see the I don't want
[9:15] you to forget as I preach this. Forget
[9:17] the overall theme of this chapter.
[9:20] love uh love can only or love is the
[9:23] only way that gifts even matter in a
[9:26] church,
[9:27] &gt;&gt; right? So, you know, and we got to be
[9:28] careful. I got to be careful too, but we
[9:30] I preach the importance of gifts and
[9:32] yes, we need them and uh we should pray
[9:33] for them more. The Bible said covet them
[9:35] earnestly, you know, and we should
[9:37] emphasize the gifts, but if we don't
[9:39] have the giver, then it doesn't make any
[9:41] it doesn't help us at all if I preach on
[9:43] the gifts
[9:44] &gt;&gt; because remember just like a tinkling
[9:46] child. And I'm sure Malachi, Lydia,
[9:48] Caseia, were all guilty of that. I'm
[9:50] sure I was guilty of that growing up,
[9:51] right? Symbols or drums, whatever,
[9:53] whatever noise making. I guess in our
[9:55] day, brother Bang was probably metal
[9:56] pots, right? Pots in the kitchen. Bang,
[9:58] bang, bang, bang, bang. Just all this
[10:01] noise. So any gift of God, if there's
[10:03] not love there, it's just this
[10:04] annoyance.
[10:06] It doesn't mean anything. It's not
[10:08] helpful to me.
[10:13] So it must be remembered that as much as
[10:17] we love the nine gifts, we need them and
[10:19] everybody has one
[10:21] &gt;&gt; and you should be consecrated for your
[10:23] gift.
[10:24] &gt;&gt; As much as that's true,
[10:27] without love, then it doesn't matter if
[10:29] we're consecrated to a gift
[10:31] &gt;&gt; because then we're just consecrated to
[10:33] God doing something in us rather than
[10:35] God giving us a pure heart.
[10:40] So, we read our text and um you can
[10:43] speak with tongues of men or angels. So,
[10:46] there's two kinds of tongues. Now, I
[10:48] believe when when the rapture happens,
[10:49] brother Jose, we'll know the language of
[10:51] angels. I believe that because we got to
[10:53] hear the voice of the archangel and we
[10:55] got to hear the trump of God. So, I
[10:57] believe when we're raptured, we'll get a
[10:58] new body. We'll instantly understand the
[11:00] angel's language
[11:01] &gt;&gt; and it's not English.
[11:04] Hallelujah. Like the world wants you to
[11:06] know English or Mandarin, you know, all
[11:08] these billions of people that know all
[11:09] the languages or Spanish or something
[11:11] like that. It ain't going to be a human
[11:12] language. It's going to be a heavenly
[11:14] language. Hallelujah. But if you don't
[11:16] have love, you can speak in tongues all
[11:18] day. You can talk angel language and it
[11:21] doesn't mean anything.
[11:23] You can prophesy and foretell who's
[11:25] going to win the next election. You got
[11:26] a 50% chance.
[11:29] Uh you can understand all the mysteries
[11:30] like I believe we do. I believe with all
[11:33] my heart we understand all the Bible
[11:34] mysteries, the 12 New Testament
[11:36] mysteries and we can have all the
[11:38] knowledge. We can understand all things.
[11:39] Now I don't believe we have that.
[11:43] And though I have all faith that I could
[11:45] remove mountains and have not charity,
[11:48] I'm nothing. So we could speak to that
[11:49] storm. We could speak to that situation
[11:51] and it could move and it could it could
[11:53] happen and and uh the house of hell
[11:56] could give way to the name of Jesus
[11:57] Christ and some miracle could happen.
[11:59] But without God's love, the Bible said
[12:01] we are nothing.
[12:04] That's why we never lift people up too
[12:05] much if a miracle happens because I want
[12:07] to watch them afterwards. Brother Chris,
[12:09] how do they love God?
[12:12] &gt;&gt; How do they treat pe? How do they treat
[12:13] their enemies? That's what I want to
[12:15] watch.
[12:16] Like brother Brandham said, they
[12:17] somebody says, "Oh, the wind of the Holy
[12:19] Ghost struck me and I'm born again."
[12:21] Okay, now I want to see how do you act
[12:23] once that wind leaves.
[12:26] Now I want to see what you're made of.
[12:28] I want to see how you act when the first
[12:30] time somebody comes against you and
[12:31] rebukes you to your face or calls you a
[12:33] name, calls you a devil. Now I want to
[12:35] see how you act.
[12:38] Now there are some acceptable reactions
[12:40] to that. Right? Paul and Jesus rebuke
[12:42] demon spirits. Right?
[12:45] So there are certain you could have a
[12:46] angry reaction. You could rebuke that
[12:48] spirit or you could have a forgiving
[12:49] spirit
[12:52] like like they called Jesus be elabub
[12:53] and what did he say? Uh Jesus said I'll
[12:56] forgive you for that. He said, "But when
[12:57] the Holy Ghost comes, he won't forgive
[12:59] you of that." Right. Right. That's what
[13:03] Jesus said. So, you might have a
[13:04] merciful reaction or you might have a
[13:06] judgmental reaction, but then let's
[13:08] watch and see how you live. Let's see
[13:11] that by God's grace, you bring all sin
[13:14] in your life under subjection
[13:16] &gt;&gt; to the word of God. And I'm sorry, I'm
[13:18] just wearing this bracelet. A
[13:19] six-year-old boy gave me this bracelet.
[13:20] It says Jesus is King on it. And I
[13:22] forgot to take it off. It's got crosses
[13:24] on the back.
[13:25] I'm not trying to present any new uh
[13:27] church fashion trends, okay? I just
[13:30] forgot to take it off. That little sweet
[13:31] boy talks about Jesus with me.
[13:35] Hallelujah. Amen. And look, you can give
[13:39] all your money away. Like you can
[13:41] listen, you can be opposite of the rich
[13:43] young ruler and still not have love. The
[13:45] rich young ruler is like, "No, I'm not
[13:47] going to give it away. I'm going to
[13:48] build bigger barns." You can be opposite
[13:50] of that. I'm not going to build up
[13:51] barns. I'm not going I'm going to empty
[13:53] out my saving account. give it all away
[13:55] and still not have the love of God. Paul
[13:58] said you can give your body to be
[13:59] burned. Well, I'll die on the sake for
[14:01] Jesus, but without love, it doesn't
[14:03] profit you anything.
[14:06] So, it's this is brother Ram said, "This
[14:08] is a deep chapter, right? This is a deep
[14:10] book." Hallelujah.
[14:14] So, it doesn't profit a person anything
[14:16] to give their body away, to give their
[14:19] money away unless they have the love of
[14:20] God. That's why church, we want to make
[14:22] sure when we give away, when we give
[14:24] money away or give food away or do
[14:27] anything for God, even give our tithes
[14:28] and offerings, when we do that, we want
[14:30] to make sure we do it with the love of
[14:31] God.
[14:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Or if I pray for somebody
[14:35] and I rebuke an evil spirit or I rebuke
[14:37] a a demonic uh spirit of disease or when
[14:41] I do that, I want to make sure I do it
[14:42] with the love of God that I'm not doing
[14:44] this so something will be done to
[14:45] glorify me, but I want to see God's
[14:47] children set free. Amen.
[14:50] &gt;&gt; In other words, I want everything I do
[14:51] to be detached from bringing me glory.
[14:56] &gt;&gt; I just want this for the glory of Jesus
[14:58] Christ. Now, church, you know, you know
[15:00] how you'll have that idea because you're
[15:02] already doing things in private and
[15:03] secret. You're already praying in
[15:06] secret. And the church said,
[15:07] &gt;&gt; you're already fasting in secret. You're
[15:09] not bragging about your fasting or
[15:10] praying or you're giving of alms. If
[15:12] you're living a life in secret, then I
[15:15] believe God will give you that peace
[15:17] that when God wants to use your gifts,
[15:19] then it'll already be built into your
[15:21] life. You'll already be a surrendered
[15:23] person. You'll be a selfless person, a
[15:26] sacrificial person because you're doing
[15:28] things in secret. You want the heavenly
[15:30] father to see what you're doing.
[15:33] Now, that's a lot of words and maybe if
[15:34] I didn't explain it right, then God
[15:36] forgive me. May the Holy Ghost help you
[15:38] to understand what I meant. I said a lot
[15:40] in there. Maybe I didn't bring it out
[15:41] the right way.
[15:47] Now remember, uh this is a good place to
[15:49] put in that quote. Brother Bam said,
[15:50] "I'd rather have the right spirit than
[15:53] the right doctrine." This is a good
[15:55] place for this to go into. But like I
[15:57] said on Wednesday, I want the right
[15:59] spirit and I want the right doctrine.
[16:02] Because if you got your Bible, go
[16:03] quickly to a second John, I think it's
[16:05] 89 and 10. Again, just this is the
[16:07] verse. I shared this with Cam's wife.
[16:09] Cam's wife was writing a book and I
[16:10] thought that was really sweet, sister
[16:12] Julia. So maybe we'll hear about that
[16:13] next month. But remember, uh, second
[16:16] John, you know, I was, sister Julia was
[16:19] mentioned something and I said, you
[16:20] know, I said, don't forget this verse,
[16:21] sister. Uh, doctrine is so important.
[16:25] Now, message churches try to throw that
[16:27] out. That's because they don't want to
[16:28] study or they don't have the gift to
[16:30] teach.
[16:31] And maybe they're jealous of teachers
[16:33] who can rightly divide the word of God.
[16:35] I don't know. But look at verse uh 2
[16:39] John 9:10-11. Whosoever transgress and
[16:42] abideth not in the doctrine of Christ
[16:44] hath not God.
[16:48] &gt;&gt; You don't have God unless you've got the
[16:51] right teaching.
[16:54] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say that again. You don't
[16:56] have God unless you teach the right
[16:58] things.
[17:00] &gt;&gt; Is doctrine important, church?
[17:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[17:03] &gt;&gt; He that abideth not in the doctrine of
[17:05] Christ. So that those that disobey the
[17:07] teaching of Christ,
[17:09] he hath I'm sorry, he [snorts] that
[17:12] abideth in I'm sorry, he that abideth in
[17:13] the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the
[17:15] father and the son. So you've got the
[17:18] invisible spirit and the high priest of
[17:20] heaven on your side. Amen. Hallelujah.
[17:22] Praise God. Amen. If there come un any
[17:26] of you and bring not this doctrine,
[17:27] receive him not into your house. You got
[17:28] to be careful with those Mormons coming
[17:30] to your door. of those Jehovah's
[17:31] Witnesses.
[17:34] Neither bid him God's speed. Now, one
[17:35] time I let the Mormons in my house in Ka
[17:37] Falls and I brought it down to this. I
[17:40] said, I said, "You told me just to pray
[17:42] and see if God will tell me Joseph Smith
[17:44] is a prophet." But I said, "I follow a
[17:46] prophet." And he pointed me back to the
[17:48] word of God. I don't have to I don't
[17:50] have to just look for a prayer to be
[17:51] answered. I can point to the Bible and I
[17:53] know Brother Brandon was a prophet.
[17:57] And I said, "Your prophet said you only
[18:00] get the Holy Ghost after you're baptized
[18:02] in water." That's what Joseph Smith
[18:04] said. I said, "But my Bible says, uh,
[18:07] Cornelius got the Holy Ghost before he
[18:09] was baptized in water."
[18:11] &gt;&gt; I said, "Go ask your, uh, Mormon leader,
[18:14] which is right, Joseph Smith or the
[18:16] Bible, and if you love me, you'll come
[18:17] back and tell me the truth." And they
[18:18] never came back. So, they don't love me,
[18:21] which means they don't have the love of
[18:22] God. But I love them enough to tell them
[18:26] the truth. truth. I had those two elders
[18:27] sitting at my table. I was older than
[18:28] both of them. Now, I was an elder at the
[18:31] time because I was a pastor, but I was
[18:33] older than these two boys telling me
[18:34] they're elders. I said, "If you love me,
[18:37] you go tell me the answer because your
[18:38] do your pro your false prophet," I
[18:40] didn't say that, but your prophet Joseph
[18:41] Smith goes against my prophet's Bible.
[18:45] So, don't let these people in your house
[18:46] unless you're ready to fight.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I mean with the love of
[18:50] God.
[18:51] &gt;&gt; Just say no thanks. I already know where
[18:53] I stand. already know God sent a true
[18:55] prophet.
[18:57] So don't let him into your house because
[18:58] yeah verse 10. If there come any of you
[19:00] and bring not this doctrine receive him
[19:01] not TO YOUR HOUSE. DON'T LET that person
[19:03] in your house neither bid him God's
[19:06] speed.
[19:08] Right? For he that abide I'm sorry. For
[19:10] he that bidth him God's speed is a
[19:12] partaker of his evil deeds. Hallelujah.
[19:15] Now if these people are doing evil, you
[19:17] don't wish them God's speed. Now I might
[19:19] have told those brothers, God bless you.
[19:21] I don't remember. That was like 15 or 20
[19:23] years ago. I don't remember.
[19:26] But you just got to be led of the Lord
[19:28] because remember, listen, I've got the
[19:30] with this question. You've got both
[19:31] sides. Jesus said, "Bless those who
[19:33] persecute you. Bless those who hate you.
[19:36] Bless your enemies."
[19:38] &gt;&gt; So, you've got that and you've got this.
[19:40] Well, don't bless them if they come to
[19:42] your house and they're trying to bring
[19:43] evil deeds in there. So, I've got both
[19:45] ones. How do I know which one to do? God
[19:47] will lead you.
[19:49] God will let you know which one to do.
[19:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So, brother Ram says,
[19:55] "No." So, so see church,
[19:58] you know, people can understand all the
[19:59] mysteries, all the knowledge, have all
[20:01] faith, but if they don't have love, they
[20:03] don't have nothing. Brother, brother
[20:05] talked about this in ' 61 with Catholics
[20:07] and Protestants. He said it is just like
[20:09] the Catholic, as I've often said, if
[20:11] he's a Catholic and depending on Christ
[20:13] for salvation, he's saved. Now church
[20:15] this is a quite a statement because
[20:17] Catholics have to go to confession and
[20:19] confess their sins to a priest.
[20:23] Catholics have to take prayer beads
[20:25] brother Chris and they got to touch each
[20:26] bead and say a certain thing. Hail Mary
[20:28] full of mother full of c they got to
[20:30] pray with beads to Mary and yet they can
[20:32] still be saved. Apparently they can
[20:35] brother Chris.
[20:38] Yep. I preached on Wednesday night. Yep.
[20:40] Yep. That's right. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. The
[20:42] pope said, "Well, now we don't have to
[20:43] call her co- mediatrix anymore." Which
[20:45] was absolute heresy and blasphemy. To
[20:48] say that Mary had a part in redemption.
[20:50] Either Jesus did it all or Jesus did
[20:53] nothing.
[20:54] &gt;&gt; But Jesus PAID IT ALL. ALL to him I owe.
[20:57] Amen.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; Sin and left a crimson stain. But Jesus
[21:01] washed us white as snow. AMEN. MARY HAD
[21:04] NO PART IN THAT. HALLELUJAH. It
[21:05] &gt;&gt; only took him 500 years to figure that
[21:07] out. Brother Malachi. 500 years. They
[21:10] finally figured that out. What's the
[21:11] pope trying to do? He's trying to get
[21:12] Protestants to join their movement.
[21:14] &gt;&gt; He's trying to bring in the mark of the
[21:16] beast. Right.
[21:18] &gt;&gt; Now, that's quite a statement, brother
[21:20] said. In church, it is for me because I
[21:21] know Catholics, too. And they do the
[21:22] holy water. Brother Vang, you ever seen
[21:24] that? They got to sprinkle. They have a
[21:25] priest sprinkle holy water on them when
[21:27] they walk in. I've seen it. They got
[21:28] that little fountain right there in the
[21:29] vestibule. They take the holy water.
[21:31] Well, now I'm holy. Now I'm holy. I got
[21:32] water on me. and they just watched eight
[21:34] hours of football or they just watched a
[21:36] filthy movie last night full of sex
[21:37] scenes and all this blasphemy and now
[21:40] you're holy because you got water on
[21:41] you. No, you're not. You need the water
[21:43] of the word.
[21:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. You need the water of repentance.
[21:47] Praise God.
[21:48] &gt;&gt; Well, just sprinkle holy water. Now
[21:50] you're holy. Holy. You're not. But yeah,
[21:53] brother says if you're trusting in Jesus
[21:55] as a Catholic, you're saved. I believe
[21:58] that's true. You can be. But listen
[22:00] church, you'll only But it's as if a
[22:02] Catholic that does that they're only
[22:04] they're only past the Red Sea. They're
[22:07] still in the wilderness and they've got
[22:09] a long journey to the promised land. Is
[22:12] that right, church? They've only passed
[22:14] through the Red Sea where all their sins
[22:17] are forgiven and they haven't made it
[22:19] two steps, brother Chris, past the Red
[22:20] Sea. That's as far as they made it. Is
[22:23] that is that clear?
[22:25] &gt;&gt; Because that's hard to believe. And I
[22:27] tell these people too, not many people
[22:29] will be saved in the Catholic Church. I
[22:30] told that to brother Brennan. I said,
[22:32] "Few will be saved in the Lutheran
[22:33] church. Very few will be saved in the
[22:35] Baptist or the Methodist or the
[22:37] Presbyterian." Very few. But as long as
[22:40] they're trusting in the blood, they're
[22:42] saved.
[22:44] &gt;&gt; But they if but if that's all they got,
[22:46] then their their mind is also filled
[22:48] with all these uh false doctrines and
[22:51] complexes and and fear perhaps or pride
[22:54] and all these things. But yet they can
[22:56] they still be saved? Yes, they can still
[22:58] be saved.
[23:00] If he's depending on the church, he's
[23:02] what, church? Lost. If you're depending
[23:05] on this church, you are lost. If you're
[23:08] depending on Brother Ram for salvation,
[23:09] you are lost.
[23:12] &gt;&gt; We're trusting in the blood of Jesus
[23:14] Christ for our salvation.
[23:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; Any of you Pentecostal brothers know if
[23:17] we're looking to the Pentecostal church
[23:19] to save us, we're among men most
[23:21] miserable. Amen. If you're trusting in
[23:23] this church to save you, you're a
[23:25] miserable person today. No wonder you
[23:27] didn't want to come to church. Amen.
[23:28] You're miserable. YOU'RE TRUSTING IN THE
[23:30] WRONG THING. BUT IF YOU'RE TRUSTING IN
[23:32] JESUS CHRIST, HAPPY ARE YOU.
[23:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Then you love to COME TO CHURCH.
[23:37] YOU LOVE TO PRAISE GOD. You love to hear
[23:39] the word of God because you're trusting
[23:40] in someone greater than you. You're
[23:42] trusting IN A RELIABLE WITNESS, AN
[23:44] AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE, the word of God,
[23:47] Jesus Christ.
[23:49] That's right.
[23:50] We're lost if we're trusting in the
[23:52] Pentecostal or the message church.
[23:54] But if we're looking in Jesus Christ and
[23:56] we're saved but by faith in what a
[23:59] finished work.
[24:02] Somebody said uh uh brother Brandham I
[24:05] don't want to take sides on the brethren
[24:06] and but I as long as you fuss you're
[24:08] both wrong. So when people have
[24:10] different opinions if you're fussing and
[24:12] arguing and hateful about it brother
[24:14] Brandham says you're both wrong.
[24:17] But see church I've learned this. I can
[24:19] disagree totally with somebody and still
[24:21] love them and I don't hold bitterness in
[24:24] my heart to them. I just see them like
[24:25] we heard this many years ago. Bang might
[24:27] remember how would any of you get mad if
[24:30] you're walking the street and a blind
[24:31] man he's got a cane and he steps on your
[24:33] foot. How many would get mad at the
[24:35] blind man say CAN'T YOU SEE WHERE YOU'RE
[24:37] GOING?
[24:40] YEAH. YEAH. These days. But a real
[24:42] purehearted person would a real
[24:43] purehearted person get mad. Can't you
[24:46] see? you can't see, right?
[24:51] And that's how it is when I talk to
[24:52] denominational people. I realize they
[24:54] can't see what we can see. Thank God we
[24:56] can see the truth. Praise God. And if
[24:58] they step on my toes, brother, brother
[25:00] Austin, then it's just a little bruise.
[25:02] It'll heal.
[25:04] They didn't chop off my toes. They
[25:06] didn't chop off my foot. They just
[25:07] stepped on my toes. So I realized, well,
[25:10] they're just blind. I can forgive them.
[25:13] Like yesterday, a brother come up and
[25:14] boy, we had a good talk. The girls
[25:16] watching me. We were debating back and
[25:17] forth and it was really good at the
[25:18] park. It was ordained of God because
[25:20] that man and his wife are from Romania.
[25:22] How did they get to Wadssworth, Ohio
[25:23] last night and he's like, "I've never
[25:25] met a" He said, "I've always wanted to
[25:26] meet Christians like you that really
[25:28] love God and let's stay in touch and all
[25:30] these things." We were talking about the
[25:31] book of life and the Holy Ghost, the
[25:33] four grounds and it was a three works of
[25:35] grace and and the three parts of a man.
[25:37] It was just an exciting exchange. And
[25:39] the whole time he might be disagreeing
[25:40] with me, I'm just like, I love this guy.
[25:42] I said, I'm going to keep giving him the
[25:43] word test. I love him. Even if he calls
[25:46] me wrong, that's fine. I love this guy.
[25:48] He might be a trinitarian. I love you
[25:49] anyway. You can't hurt my feelings. You
[25:52] can't hurt me because the the Bible says
[25:54] you can't hurt the oil and the wine.
[25:57] There it is. Amen. Remember the third
[25:58] seal. JESUS SAID, "TOUCH NOT, HURT
[26:00] [screaming] NOT THE OIL AND THE WINE."
[26:02] PRAISE GOD.
[26:03] &gt;&gt; THEY can't hurt my revelation, BROTHER
[26:05] PATRICK. THEY CAN'T TAKE IT AWAY FROM ME
[26:07] BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GIVE IT TO ME.
[26:08] PRAISE GOD.
[26:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[26:10] &gt;&gt; If God gave me the revelation, NO MAN
[26:12] CAN TAKE IT FROM ME. PRAISE GOD. THE
[26:14] GATES OF HELL CANNOT PREVAIL AGAINST
[26:16] THIS REVELATION.
[26:19] &gt;&gt; So I love it when people disagree with
[26:20] me. I love it. Let's keep talking.
[26:23] Hallelujah.
[26:25] As long But see, as long as we fuss and
[26:27] argue, well, I'm going to show this guy.
[26:28] I really want to show this guy he's
[26:30] nothing. I want to make his head swim.
[26:33] Then I'm fussing with him.
[26:36] And then I'm wrong because I'd rather be
[26:38] wrong in my doctrine and right in my
[26:40] heart than to be right in my doctrine
[26:41] and wrong in my heart.
[26:42] After all, it's your heart's condition.
[26:45] I agree with that. But we should have
[26:48] the right doctrine and we should have
[26:49] the right spirit. Brother Ram's
[26:52] emphasizing, don't fuss with people.
[26:53] Don't get upset. Yes, debate them with
[26:56] love, right? Talk with them. Yes, tell
[26:58] them the truth. Disagree with them with
[27:00] Christianity with with love and
[27:02] patience, but don't get fussing with
[27:04] them. Don't start hating them. Don't get
[27:08] a root of bitterness.
[27:10] And I made that practice to know this
[27:13] that if a man, no matter what he does or
[27:15] how much he differs and what he says
[27:16] about me, if in my heart, not from just
[27:20] a duty, but from my heart, I can't love
[27:23] that man as much as I love anyone else,
[27:25] then I know there's something wrong in
[27:27] here. Hallelujah. What a statement. See,
[27:31] church, you've got to be able to love
[27:33] your enemy just like you love anybody
[27:35] else in your family.
[27:38] I can still love them. In other words, I
[27:39] wish the best for you, Claude. Even if
[27:41] brother Austin, if we disagree on
[27:43] something, I still wish the best for
[27:44] you. Even my own children.
[27:47] If Haven and I don't see eye to eye, I
[27:49] still wish the best for Haven. Right?
[27:52] And we've seen that over the years in
[27:53] the message. We find people disagree.
[27:55] That's okay. I still love them anyway.
[27:58] I want my heart to be pure. Now, if
[28:01] they're preaching some false doctrine,
[28:02] yes, I'm not going to bring you back to
[28:03] the church. Yes, I'm not going to have
[28:05] you come back if you're a false teacher
[28:07] or something like that. But I still love
[28:08] you. I want the best for you, which is
[28:11] really repentance.
[28:14] And here, what is it? She was Now, here
[28:16] I want to bring this out. See how
[28:17] important doctrine is, brother. I talk
[28:19] about the Roman Catholic Church. She was
[28:20] a mother of harlots. Now, what made her
[28:22] a harlot? What made her a Her
[28:24] what? Her doctrine?
[28:27] See, I want the right doctrine because I
[28:28] don't want to be a to Christ.
[28:32] What made them a harlot? She He says it
[28:34] again, her doctrine. He says it twice.
[28:36] What makes this woman so filthy? Her
[28:38] false doctrine.
[28:41] Okay, so I I know we I know we
[28:43] understand, but I just want you to see
[28:44] it again that we need to balance that
[28:47] that quote out about the right doctrine
[28:49] and the right spirit. And brother Jose
[28:51] and I rejoice in this last year.
[28:53] Remember brother Jose Balam was anointed
[28:55] with the same spirit was upon Moses.
[28:56] What was the difference? The teaching of
[28:58] Moses was perfect. Jesus hated the
[29:01] teaching of Balum because he taught them
[29:03] to commit sexual sin.
[29:06] See, anyone that allows you to commit
[29:07] sexual sin, anyone that allows you to
[29:09] keep going on in sin, that teaching is
[29:11] from hell.
[29:13] We are to purify our hearts. The Bible
[29:16] said anyone that has the hope of Jesus
[29:18] return will purify themselves.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; How many would say, "Lord, purify me
[29:24] today."
[29:25] &gt;&gt; That's the right spirit.
[29:27] And remember, even God himself, this was
[29:29] one of Moses's songs in Deuteronomy.
[29:31] This is so Moses is singing, "Give ear,
[29:34] oh ye heavens, and I will speak." Now,
[29:37] you know, I'm not much of a sinner or a
[29:39] singer. I don't want to be much of a
[29:40] sinner either. And here, O earth, the
[29:43] words of my mouth. So Moses is singing
[29:44] this song. This song goes, "My doctrine
[29:47] shall drop as the rain.
[29:50] My speech shall disill."
[29:56] So God Moses is singing this song. HE'S
[29:58] SINGING ABOUT DOCTRINE. AMEN.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; He's singing about the teaching of
[30:01] Jesus. Jesus teaches me to go in all the
[30:04] right ways. Amen.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus teaches me TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT. AND
[30:08] I'M GOING TO SING ABOUT THAT. It's like
[30:10] rain that we got today. Now, I don't
[30:12] know how many you enjoyed getting wet
[30:13] today. I don't know. A couple. Okay,
[30:15] three hands. I kind of liked it. Kind of
[30:18] kind of felt refreshing.
[30:20] But that's what God God compares that
[30:22] rain out there to teaching you about
[30:24] water baptism and the Godhead. Amen. And
[30:28] mystery Babylon. and the baptism of the
[30:30] HOLY GHOST. THAT'S WHAT IT FEELS LIKE.
[30:31] I'm getting wet. I'm getting refreshed.
[30:34] I'm getting rained on. I'm changing. I'm
[30:37] becoming refreshed in the presence of
[30:38] God.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory.
[30:43] Remember this is this is God's own. This
[30:45] is God's own. Thus sayith the Lord. This
[30:47] is God saying, "Thus sayaith God about
[30:49] doctrine. My my teaching drops as the
[30:52] former and latter reign." Now remember
[30:54] brother Ram says about the love of God
[30:56] six times. If you go back, I really
[30:58] would encourage you if you haven't done
[30:59] it, go listen to uh the book of
[31:01] Corinthians correction or Corinthians
[31:03] book of correction 1957. It's a Sunday
[31:06] school brother teaches the congregation
[31:08] before a preacher comes to preach.
[31:12] And notice he didn't say, "Well, I'm
[31:13] going to teach Sunday school and then
[31:14] we're going to sit down and just play a
[31:15] tape." He said, "No, we're going to I'm
[31:17] going to preach or I'm going to teach
[31:18] and then we're going to hear the
[31:19] preacher." Hallelujah. I'm just going to
[31:22] lay that in there. But I've I've told
[31:24] this too. If I get sick on a Sunday
[31:26] morning and we got no other preachers,
[31:27] I'm gonna tell Malachi, play a tape or
[31:30] put a live stream up there. I guess we
[31:32] could do that, too, with the technology
[31:33] we got. We could put a live stream
[31:34] service up there. Now, hopefully I don't
[31:36] get sick this year. I'm not speaking any
[31:38] sickness into existence. Okay, I'm not
[31:40] going to fear that. But if there's no
[31:43] other option and I get sick at the last
[31:44] minute and all the preachers are busy,
[31:46] then I'd say Malachi, play a tape
[31:48] orientation, play a tape, put a put a
[31:49] tape on the put your phone back there,
[31:51] plug it in or whatever you got to do,
[31:52] play a tape. There's nobody else. That's
[31:54] the last that's the last uh measure we
[31:57] go to.
[31:59] But for 2,000 years, every Christian
[32:02] church has had living men preaching the
[32:04] living word of God.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; That's God's unchanging pattern. Amen.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes. They read Paul's
[32:10] epistles, but what happened after that?
[32:12] Did they read it every service? No. They
[32:13] get the pastor, keep preaching the word.
[32:15] Praise God.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; Go back and preach. Now study that. Now
[32:18] preach the word of God. Tie these
[32:19] scriptures together. Bring it together.
[32:21] Teach the people. God's teaching rain's
[32:23] going to fall on them. Praise God.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; So in Corinthians church here, now
[32:31] here's here here's a good question Rod
[32:33] asked me on Wednesday and I I forgot
[32:35] this. Brother Bam said, "All these
[32:37] things will fail." Speaking of tongues,
[32:38] prophecy, like it says in 1 Corinthians
[32:40] 13. See, every one of them, they're just
[32:43] not to be trusted too much. Now, isn't
[32:45] that something, Brother Jose? Listen.
[32:48] all the tongues, interpretations,
[32:50] dreams, visions, miracles, speaking to
[32:52] mountains, all these spiritual
[32:55] situations. He said, "Don't trust in
[32:57] them too much because they're all going
[33:00] to pass away.
[33:02] They're all going to be fulfilled."
[33:05] &gt;&gt; And Rod asked me this. Now, think about
[33:07] this, church. This is a great question.
[33:08] And I wonder what you had said. I didn't
[33:10] ask. Rod said, "You don't have to answer
[33:11] me, but look, look what Rod said. On
[33:13] Wednesday, I preached on we don't add to
[33:15] the word of God, right? We don't add one
[33:16] word. We don't take one word away. But
[33:18] brother Rod said, "Brother Jesse, I
[33:19] actually have this question. What about
[33:21] all the thus sayith the lords from
[33:23] brother Brandham or any other preacher
[33:25] since the Bible was finished in 100 AD?"
[33:28] He said, "Do you put all those thus
[33:30] sayith the Lords on the same level as
[33:32] the Bible?" And I think I got my answer
[33:35] here.
[33:36] No, I think I trust in them a little
[33:39] bit, right?
[33:42] &gt;&gt; And they're still thus say the Lord. But
[33:43] the Bible says you don't add to it or
[33:45] take one word away from it.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; Now, does everybody see that? Because if
[33:50] if I if I do that, if I make all those
[33:52] thus say the Lord's equal to the Bible,
[33:54] I've just added to the Bible.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; I hope that doesn't stumble anybody.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Right?
[34:03] And because that's what brother Brandham
[34:04] said. That's what brother said. See all
[34:06] these things, they're not to be trusted
[34:08] too much,
[34:10] but this can be trusted. Uh, this should
[34:13] be trusted so much. Hallelujah. Trust
[34:17] this so much.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; Trust it with all you have.
[34:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[34:24] But what he's trying to have the church
[34:26] was that anchor where we have an anchor
[34:28] in Christ where we don't trust upon
[34:30] sensations. We don't trust upon
[34:33] revelations. We don't trust on these
[34:34] things only we trust Christ.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; Now I'm gonna for time's sake he was
[34:43] saying how he couldn't teach the
[34:45] Corinthians the deep things like
[34:46] predestination and adoption. He said and
[34:49] the Holy Spirit can wind these great
[34:51] truths and anchor it in the people's
[34:52] hearts so they know where they're
[34:54] standing. Sensation or no sensation,
[34:56] prophecy or no prophecy, whatever it
[34:59] might be. Now let me just lay this in
[35:01] here.
[35:04] In other words, if your whole family
[35:06] came against you and hated you and let's
[35:08] say kicked you out of the house, would
[35:10] you still stand for Jesus Christ?
[35:13] &gt;&gt; That's how you know you're trusting in
[35:14] the anchor of God's love.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; Or if they said, "Well, you've got to
[35:18] believe. You got to leave the message or
[35:20] you think about that with our family
[35:21] thanksgiving. What if our family that's
[35:22] not in the message would say, "If you
[35:24] don't renounce the message in the Lord
[35:26] Jesus Christ baptism, then you're not
[35:28] welcome at our thanksgiving. What would
[35:30] you do?
[35:32] I'd hope you'd stand with the Lord Jesus
[35:34] Christ water baptism.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; That would show whether you've really
[35:38] got the love and the anchor in your
[35:40] heart. Thank God most people won't do
[35:41] that. Hallelujah.
[35:44] But see, that would be because no matter
[35:46] what sensation or no matter what
[35:48] relationship, no matter what experience
[35:49] you had, when it all boils down to it,
[35:52] it's the it's your love for Jesus Christ
[35:55] that will anchor you with the truth
[35:56] because God is truth. The word is truth
[35:59] and Jesus is the word.
[36:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, that's what Paul's
[36:04] trying to get this church to see. Your
[36:06] anchor, what holds you in the time of
[36:08] storm is the is the word of God. It's
[36:10] the truth of God. That's what's going to
[36:12] keep you in your difficult times of
[36:14] testing.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; I'm standing with Jesus. I'm standing
[36:20] with the revelation.
[36:22] Hallelujah.
[36:26] Paul said, "You could have every one of
[36:28] those tongues and gifts and everything."
[36:29] Paul said, "And be lost. I'm nothing."
[36:31] But see, when you've got love, that's
[36:33] the anchor.
[36:35] So, some of you might speak in tongues.
[36:37] That's great. But make sure you got
[36:38] love. As I've said before, some of us
[36:41] might have wisdom or discernment. That's
[36:42] great, but let's make sure we have love.
[36:45] I want to make sure I've got the love of
[36:46] God in my heart. All right.
[36:50] After Brother Ram's first wife and
[36:53] Sharon Rose died, Mr. Eisler asked him,
[36:56] "Billy, what does Christ mean to you
[36:57] now? My father was gone. My brother, my
[36:59] wife, what does he mean to you now?" He
[37:02] said, "He means more than life to me."
[37:06] Wow. I just lost my wife. I just lost a
[37:09] baby. I lost my dad, my brother. All
[37:11] these people are dying. What? What?
[37:13] Where's Jesus? All in the midst of this.
[37:14] He said, "HE'S CLOSER TO ME THAN EVER."
[37:16] HALLELUJAH.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; WHEN I'VE NEEDED HIM, CHRIST IS THERE
[37:19] FOR ME. HALLELUJAH.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; SEE, when this hap when death happens OR
[37:24] TRAGEDY STRIKES, THAT'S THE TIME TO SEE
[37:26] CHRIST IS HERE. HALLELUJAH.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; And that makes you love him more because
[37:32] in the midst of all the storm, you've
[37:34] got an anchor that ANCHORS YOU ON GOD
[37:36] LOVES ME. HE SENT HIS SON JESUS to save
[37:38] me AND I'LL LIVE WITH HIM ETERNALLY.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN. [laughter]
[37:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[37:46] Now my prayer is God, help me to have
[37:47] this kind of faith when I go through
[37:49] tough times.
[37:51] Help me to have this kind of faith that
[37:53] no matter the trials in my life, I love
[37:55] Christ more than ever before.
[38:00] Brother Ram said, I love this. It wasn't
[38:01] because I was religious.
[38:05] Hallelujah. It's more than just myself.
[38:09] Hallelujah. It's something that God
[38:11] through the grace of God did for me.
[38:15] If I was in hell and there was still
[38:17] such a thing as love in hell, I'd still
[38:19] love him. Praise God. That's I love that
[38:22] quote. Don't you, brother Jose?
[38:23] [laughter]
[38:24] If there's such a thing as LOVE IN HELL,
[38:27] THEN I'D STILL LOVE him if he sent me to
[38:29] hell. Praise God.
[38:31] That's all. Because something in here.
[38:34] That's right. I deserve every punishment
[38:36] I ever got.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; You do the same. Amen.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; But it's that anchor that something that
[38:42] anchor of love of God that holds in the
[38:44] human heart other things become
[38:46] secondarily. So what IS THE FIRST
[38:48] PRIMARY THING IN YOUR LIFE? THE love of
[38:51] God, God's love for you and your love
[38:54] for God. Because that's the greatest
[38:56] commandment. The greatest commandment is
[38:57] love the Lord your God with all your
[38:59] heart, soul, mind, and strength and love
[39:00] thy neighbor as thyself.
[39:03] That's your primary thing. Yes, we've
[39:05] all I got to go to work. I got to take
[39:07] care of my family. I got nine kids. I
[39:08] got to do all that. But the primary
[39:10] thing of all above ALL THAT IS, DO I
[39:12] love Jesus Christ with all my heart? And
[39:15] let me make sure I've got that in my
[39:16] heart first before I start anything else
[39:18] throughout the day. Hallelujah.
[39:22] That's the primary. Loving God's not a
[39:25] secondary. Loving God is the primary
[39:27] thing in your life. If something's
[39:30] keeping you from loving God, get rid of
[39:32] it. It's become an idol, church. Keep
[39:36] yourselves from idols.
[39:39] Hallelujah.
[39:43] Ram said, "Your love for God's got to be
[39:45] more than intellectuals, emotional
[39:47] workup." He talks about a new birth. He
[39:50] said, "Christ, oh, I love this. Look,
[39:52] look at this church. You don't have to
[39:54] wonder, will I make it?" Anybody come
[39:56] here to church wondering, Lord, am I
[39:57] going to make the rapture? Am I going to
[39:59] make heaven? Brother Ram says, if you
[40:00] have the love of God, you don't wonder
[40:02] that.
[40:03] [laughter] HALLELUJAH. YOU DON'T HAVE to
[40:06] wonder, will I make it? Oh, no. It isn't
[40:08] whether I'll make it. It's already made
[40:10] for me.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus already made the way for me.
[40:14] Christ in me has made it himself. And I
[40:17] just trust his anchor alone. What a
[40:20] wonderful thing that I can trust Jesus
[40:22] Christ as my anchor.
[40:25] Will I make it? Well, I don't know. The
[40:26] question is, did Jesus make it? Yes.
[40:28] Well, then I'll make it because I'm in
[40:29] Christ.
[40:31] CHRIST IS IN ME. LET'S SAY IT. LET'S SAY
[40:33] IT TOGETHER. LET'S LET'S say Christ is
[40:34] in me. Ready? Christ is in me. If If
[40:37] you've got Christ in you, YOU'VE ALREADY
[40:39] MADE IT. You're going to make it by
[40:41] God's grace.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Don't wonder because Christ is already
[40:45] in you.
[40:48] Hallelujah.
[40:52] Brother man, I'm praying for the revival
[40:53] at the end of this Sunday school. Now I
[40:55] pray that you'll give us the real Holy
[40:56] Spirit in our hearts and it may anchor
[40:58] there for eternity. Make us to So
[41:02] brother says, "Let the Holy Spirit make
[41:03] us examine ourselves, us that are
[41:05] married." So all of us that are married
[41:07] by the way we treat our wives. Now if
[41:09] you're not married, look at how you
[41:10] treat your brothers and sisters. That
[41:13] will tell you if you have the real love
[41:14] of God. Hallelujah. But if you're
[41:17] married, look how you treat your husband
[41:19] or your wife. that will tell you if you
[41:21] got the love of God. That's what brother
[41:23] Bam says.
[41:26] How true are we and how true is our
[41:27] wives to us? And may we just get in our
[41:29] hearts that this morning that we'd think
[41:31] if something like that happened in our
[41:33] home and then may we turn our affections
[41:35] toward God and say, "Oh God, be merciful
[41:38] to me."
[41:40] Amen.
[41:41] Now, you might remember I preached this
[41:43] in part four of this series on
[41:45] Corinthians. I preached I just jumped
[41:46] ahead to the love of God and I preached
[41:49] chapter 13. Does anybody remember that?
[41:51] Raise your hand. Does anybody remember?
[41:52] Okay. One, two, two. Okay. Two. Yeah. I
[41:55] didn't even remember. I had to go look
[41:56] it up myself.
[41:58] The fourth sermon. Now, we're on part 23
[42:00] already. And remember, I took a
[42:02] six-month break from this series because
[42:04] I just felt led to preach on other
[42:05] things. It was just so striking to me.
[42:07] Uh, but remember, uh, agape love has at
[42:12] least 16 attributes.
[42:15] Now, so there's the word agape in the
[42:17] Greek, and I'm not trying to get deep on
[42:18] you. I just want you to see agape love
[42:21] is the purest form of love in the Bible.
[42:24] It's God's love. Agape, it means
[42:28] goodwill. So God, now think about it,
[42:29] church. God has good towards you. But if
[42:33] he has good will towards us, he also has
[42:35] to correct us. Right?
[42:38] Now, I got this off of Chat GDP and then
[42:40] I confirmed it. But there's at least
[42:42] five words that mean love. Four, I'm
[42:46] sorry, four in the New Testament. And
[42:48] aeros is not in the Bible, but there's a
[42:50] Hebrew equivalent to it in Song of
[42:52] Solomon where Solomon says, "My beloved
[42:55] is mine and I am his." I'm sorry. That's
[42:57] where the Schulomite says that. So
[42:58] there's a Hebrew equivalent to aeros.
[43:01] Aeros love is like sexual love. Okay? Or
[43:03] married love we would say. But agape, I
[43:06] looked these other ones up. These are
[43:07] accurate. And then I added Philadelphia.
[43:09] Philadelphia means brotherly love. It's
[43:11] the love of brothers and sisters. So
[43:13] Malachi and Lydia and Aacia and Haven
[43:15] and all I could name all my children.
[43:17] Their love for each other is
[43:18] Philadelphia. But their spiritual love
[43:20] for like that for Austin and I, Jose and
[43:22] I, right? Brother Vang and I, Christ and
[43:24] I. We've got that brotherly love.
[43:27] Hallelujah.
[43:29] That's Philadelphia love. It's as if
[43:31] we're brothers and sisters because we
[43:33] love each other so much. Hallelujah.
[43:36] That's brotherly love. Amen.
[43:41] Uh but agape of course is God's perfect
[43:43] love for God. So agape
[43:46] the world that he gave his only begotten
[43:49] son. Hallelujah. So agape is God's
[43:53] purest divine love, total goodwill
[43:55] towards man. He wants the best. Remember
[43:58] the Bible said uh God does not God does
[44:02] not delight in the death of the wicked.
[44:03] Remember that in Ezekiel, God doesn't
[44:05] rejoice when when he has to take the the
[44:07] sinners and take them off the earth and
[44:09] judge them. God doesn't rejoice in that.
[44:11] He just does it because it's the right
[44:12] thing to do. And God is always just.
[44:15] Hallelujah.
[44:17] Felio love. You heard that? That's an
[44:19] emotional and relational love. Affection
[44:22] and friendship.
[44:24] And stoay is fam another
[44:27] family type of affection. It's devotion.
[44:32] Uh that's where Paul said, "Be kindly
[44:33] affection one to another with brotherly
[44:36] kindness in Romans 12:10." So kindness.
[44:39] So stories just were so kind to each
[44:41] other,
[44:43] right? Claude and Patrick have never
[44:45] come up and rebuked me and been unkind
[44:46] to me. They never said, "I didn't like
[44:48] your tie today, brother."
[44:50] Or they never uh they never after I
[44:52] preach, they never kicked any mulch on
[44:53] me out in the our parking lot or
[44:54] anything like that. Right? They've
[44:55] always been kind to me and I've been
[44:57] kind to them. Hallelujah.
[45:00] See, it's it's this family type of love.
[45:04] But the but here in chapter 13, it's
[45:07] agape love. So without agape, all the
[45:11] gifts are nothing. They don't mean
[45:12] anything. They don't help anybody. They
[45:14] don't help you.
[45:16] You know, if you're if you're praying,
[45:17] God, do a miracle. Well, why? It won't
[45:20] help you unless you've got the love of
[45:22] God.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, we got to be careful.
[45:26] Why do we want miracles? Why do we want
[45:28] tongues? Why do we want prophecy? Why do
[45:29] we want wisdom? Why do we want
[45:30] knowledge? We should want those to
[45:32] operate. We should covet after them, but
[45:34] we should have a love in our heart first
[45:36] that Lord, this is going to bless your
[45:38] people. Yes, it'll bless me, but I want
[45:40] this gift to bless your people as well.
[45:44] Remember, some of you are the
[45:47] some of you are the
[45:49] some people are the some of you are the
[45:52] And there's a lot of us that are the
[45:55] feet.
[45:56] Feel like I'm getting walked on all the
[45:58] time. I'm behind the scenes. Nobody sees
[46:00] me. Nobody pays attention to me. Sweaty,
[46:03] dirty,
[46:06] right? That's the I'm just the humble
[46:07] I'm just the humble believer in the
[46:09] church. I'm not the one everybody sees.
[46:11] I'm not the ones up front everybody sees
[46:13] and everybody knows about. Oh, you go to
[46:14] brother Jesse's church. Since when was
[46:16] it my church? If I passed away, is there
[46:19] going to be no more church? No. There's
[46:21] still be A CHURCH. IT'S GOD'S CHURCH IN
[46:23] AKRAN. PRAISE GOD. That God just
[46:25] happened to call me to pastor. But you
[46:27] know, we say, "Well, that's Brother
[46:28] Samuel's church or that's Brother
[46:29] Jesse's church." But really, it's God's
[46:31] church. It's just a way of identifying
[46:33] the saints in Sheffield, the saints in
[46:35] Napoleon, the saints in Akran, but it's
[46:37] not my church. It's God's church.
[46:42] Now, let's review these briefly.
[46:45] I've only been preaching 45 minutes.
[46:46] Praise God. Charity suffers long and is
[46:49] kind, which means mild. Charity envieth
[46:53] not when it boils up with envy. Oh, I
[46:55] just got to have that car like they've
[46:56] got. Oh, I just got to have the house
[46:58] like she's got.
[47:00] I've just got to have that social media
[47:02] account like she's got.
[47:05] It boils up. I want to be like them. I
[47:06] want what they have. I just got to have
[47:08] a husband like that or I just got to
[47:09] have a wife like that. It boils up envy.
[47:13] Love doesn't do that.
[47:16] I don't I don't have to be like that
[47:18] other person. I've got to be like Jesus.
[47:21] That's what the love of God does.
[47:25] I know it's hard and I think it's
[47:26] helpful for the the high schoolers too,
[47:28] you know, because they see all there's
[47:29] all these trends in high school, right?
[47:31] And uh people want to have those clothes
[47:33] or people want to hang around those
[47:34] popular people. Those are the fun
[47:36] people. Those are the cool people. But
[47:38] let's see who who does God think the
[47:40] cool people are. What does God think
[47:43] about who's the popular person? I got a
[47:45] hint for you. Here's the most popular
[47:46] people in Garfield High School right
[47:47] over here in God's eyes. [laughter]
[47:51] Or Garfield Middle School. There's one
[47:53] in the back there. They're they're the
[47:55] ones that God sees.
[47:58] They're the ones that they they don't go
[47:59] with the flow of the world. They go with
[48:01] the flow of the Holy Spirit.
[48:03] Hallelujah.
[48:05] And that's who God is looking at, right?
[48:08] That's who God cares about and trying to
[48:11] uh hear their prayers and strengthen
[48:13] them, encourage them. Praise God.
[48:17] So, let's remember not to envy sinners.
[48:20] They don't have nothing that we don't
[48:22] got something that's better.
[48:24] Everything we've got is better than the
[48:25] sinners. Hallelujah. The Bible said the
[48:28] the wicked has no peace. So if you've
[48:30] got peace at night, thank God for that.
[48:34] Charity does not vaunt itself and is not
[48:36] puffed up. So see church, let's suffer
[48:40] long. Let's have a long spirit with
[48:42] people. Let's not lose heart for people.
[48:45] Let's keep believing.
[48:50] It doesn't vaunt itself up, which means
[48:52] boast of oneself,
[48:55] embellishing or bragging and making
[48:57] these uh exaggerations about how great
[49:00] you are. That's not what love does.
[49:05] It doesn't excessively focus on
[49:06] yourself. It actually points away to
[49:09] Jesus.
[49:12] Love is not puffed up. God's agape love
[49:14] is not puffed up. It doesn't blow you,
[49:16] cause you to swell up. Look how great I
[49:19] am. No, it doesn't do that.
[49:23] Doesn't make you proud.
[49:25] Doesn't make you see how lofty I am.
[49:27] Look how much better I am than everybody
[49:29] else. That's not what love does.
[49:34] Love does not behave itself unseemly,
[49:36] which means improper or not fitting to
[49:39] the Holy Spirit. It does not seek or
[49:42] crave its own desires. That's where the
[49:45] That's where the lust of the eyes and
[49:47] lust of the flesh come in, right? You
[49:50] know, you're being led away uh from the
[49:52] Holy Spirit. When you start craving
[49:54] things you shouldn't really desire,
[49:56] that's when you officially know love is
[49:58] you put love in the back seat and now
[50:00] you're going after some carnal love,
[50:02] right? Some sinful love.
[50:07] But see, the love of God craves what God
[50:09] wants. So church, what does God want in
[50:12] your life today? Don't think about what
[50:14] you want. What does God want in your
[50:16] life today? What is I'll say like this.
[50:18] What does God crave? What does God What
[50:20] does God craving? Oh, I hope brother so
[50:22] and so does this. I hope sister so and
[50:24] so will do this. What is God craving in
[50:26] your life?
[50:28] That's love. That's what love is trying
[50:31] to express in your life. What does God
[50:33] crave from you?
[50:35] Now, we're all all of us might be
[50:37] craving, oh, I like to crave this. For
[50:38] me, I like to pay off my house. I'm
[50:40] craving that in one way, but even that
[50:43] if there's a need, I got to be able to
[50:45] take that money that I was going to pay
[50:46] on the house and I've got to be able to
[50:48] give it to someone who actually needs
[50:49] it. And I've tried to do that before by
[50:52] God's grace. I hope you have, too.
[50:55] You crave, well, I could really use this
[50:57] in another way or this food, I could
[50:58] really use this or that money, I could
[51:00] really use that. But I'm going to do
[51:01] what God wants me to do instead.
[51:06] Love is not easily provoked or you're
[51:08] quickly irritated or angry right away.
[51:12] Brother Jess, I just said one thing and
[51:13] they got angry with me. That's easily
[51:15] provoked,
[51:17] right? Quickly ready, QUICKLY READY TO
[51:20] FIGHT. QUICKLY READY TO ARGUE. I mean,
[51:22] we just said good morning, brother. You
[51:23] know, sister, I just said good morning.
[51:25] You're ready to fight already. That's
[51:26] not the love of God.
[51:29] It's not easily provoked. In other
[51:31] words, if you're a Christian, you got
[51:32] the love of God in your heart. It takes
[51:33] a lot to get you mad. And the church
[51:36] said it takes a lot to get you fired up.
[51:41] If love is ruling your heart, if agape
[51:44] love is in your heart, it takes a lot
[51:46] for get you to get you mad at somebody.
[51:49] But remember, you can be mad. Just don't
[51:51] let the sun go down upon your anger.
[51:54] Just before you go to bed, Lord Jesus,
[51:56] forgive that person. I forgive them.
[51:59] refresh me tonight that I can wake up
[52:00] and I can feel good. Right? Just commit
[52:04] it to God.
[52:07] And church, love thinks no evil of other
[52:09] people. It doesn't assume the worst.
[52:13] Hallelujah.
[52:16] Love does not rejoice in iniquity, which
[52:19] is injustice.
[52:21] See, the love of God won't be like, "Oh,
[52:23] I can't wait till I can go smoke. I
[52:25] can't wait till I can go drink that
[52:26] down. I can't wait till I can go and
[52:28] watch evil things on porn or something
[52:30] like that. That's not what love does.
[52:32] Love doesn't rejoice in wickedness,
[52:35] right? I can't wait till I can go uh get
[52:37] back at that person. Like we said, you
[52:38] know,
[52:40] can't wait till I can uh just get away
[52:42] from God and go do something else. Love
[52:44] doesn't do that. Love rejoices in what's
[52:47] true.
[52:49] What is the truth on this matter? That's
[52:51] what I rejoice in.
[52:54] Recently I was I'm going to share this
[52:55] real quick about the truth. I was
[52:58] talking to a brother about uh this
[52:59] brother had a said a critical spirit was
[53:01] coming in his church and does not this
[53:04] church
[53:06] and uh I guess something had started
[53:09] going on where people were saying
[53:10] there's no love in the church. There's
[53:11] no love in the church. Okay.
[53:16] And so a a brother walked up to this
[53:18] other brother I was talking to and he
[53:20] said, "Brother, there's no love in this
[53:21] church."
[53:23] And now this was a rumor started about
[53:25] the church by a critical spirit. And
[53:28] this brother said, "Do you hear what
[53:30] you're saying?"
[53:33] He said, "Let me give you" and he said,
[53:34] "I know I don't normally do this." He
[53:36] said, "But I laid it down with all the
[53:37] love I've tried to show to this church."
[53:40] This brother said, he's made it to every
[53:43] service. He hasn't missed one service.
[53:45] He'd paid his tithes and offerings
[53:47] faithfully.
[53:49] On top of that, he'd went and helped
[53:51] people in the church move. And he moved
[53:53] them from Ohio to another state and
[53:55] drove 11 hours to do that.
[54:01] When was the last time you drove 11
[54:02] hours to help somebody move?
[54:05] And this brother reminded them, no one
[54:07] else helped them. I and and I and
[54:09] somebody else were the only ones that
[54:11] helped this people that moved from our
[54:13] church move to a different state.
[54:17] He said, "I've he said, just this past
[54:19] week, I've done four jobs at other
[54:21] people's houses after I got off of work
[54:23] to help them with their home repairs."
[54:27] And he said, "You're trying to tell me
[54:28] there's no love in the church." He said,
[54:30] "That's all I see is love in the
[54:32] church." And the brother, he said, the
[54:34] brother went like this. He's like,
[54:35] "You're right. I'm sorry. I didn't think
[54:37] about that.
[54:40] Sure. See how See how critical spirits
[54:42] they b they try to bundle everybody up
[54:44] and make the situation look so bad. But
[54:46] if that person had only had the love of
[54:49] God, he would have been able to rejoice
[54:51] in the truth. The truth that just going
[54:53] to church and paying your tithes and
[54:55] singing and worshiping, going to prayer,
[54:57] prayer meetings, all those things, that
[54:59] is an expression of the love of God.
[55:03] But see, when rumors start, they start
[55:05] circling around the church. People can
[55:06] take such wicked thoughts like, "Oh,
[55:09] there's no love in the church." And then
[55:11] the brother said, "This brother has he
[55:12] misses church. He maybe comes to church
[55:14] three times a month." And he's talking
[55:16] about there's no love in the church.
[55:19] But brother says, "If you love God,
[55:21] you're so hungry to come to church, you
[55:23] can't wait till the church doors are
[55:24] open."
[55:25] &gt;&gt; And church, most of you don't even have
[55:26] to do that because I gave you a key.
[55:29] You don't have to wait to open the
[55:31] church door or I open it. You can open
[55:33] it.
[55:35] And the church said,
[55:36] &gt;&gt; if you love GOD SO MUCH, YOU'LL GET HERE
[55:38] BEFORE ME. PRAISE GOD. IF YOU REALLY
[55:40] want to come to church,
[55:41] &gt;&gt; in other words, nothing's going to stop
[55:42] you if you love God.
[55:46] I thought that was a good place. I've
[55:47] asked the Holy Spirit to remind that
[55:48] bring that to my remembrance that people
[55:50] can say, "There's no love. There's no
[55:51] love. All you got to do is open your
[55:53] spiritual eyes.
[55:55] Love is all around us if we're willing
[55:56] to see it."
[56:00] Oh, yeah. And that brother also did some
[56:02] work at the church and they set up uh
[56:03] they set up new foundations in the
[56:05] church because the the floor was
[56:06] sinking. And where was that other
[56:08] critical brother? He didn't even come to
[56:09] help out the church. And they called it
[56:10] a they called it a men's work night at
[56:12] the church. And this other guy won't
[56:15] even show up for he won't help people
[56:16] move. Won't come to the church work
[56:18] nights. Won't come to prayer meetings.
[56:20] Won't come to Bible study. He said
[56:21] there's no love in the church. You are
[56:23] blind.
[56:24] You're blind, my friend. Open your eyes.
[56:28] Anything we do for other people is an
[56:31] expression of God's love for them.
[56:34] Hallelujah.
[56:40] But see, love rejoices in the truth. Oh,
[56:42] thank God the truth is known. How now I
[56:44] know the truth. The truth has come out.
[56:46] Thank God for the truth.
[56:49] Now look, love bears all things.
[56:55] So see church, can we do that? Can we
[56:56] cover all up the heirs of people? Can we
[56:59] keep silence on them? Hallelujah. Can we
[57:02] conceal other people's mistakes or do
[57:04] you want to go run around and gossip
[57:05] about it?
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Do do we believe all things? Faith is
[57:11] expressed in love. Do we believe all the
[57:14] word of God? Do we really believe it
[57:16] all? That's the love of God. If we do,
[57:20] the love of God hopes all things
[57:24] and the love of God can endure all
[57:26] things. You know, sometimes we go
[57:28] through trials and we're like, when is
[57:29] this going to end? How many have ever
[57:30] thought that before? When is this going
[57:32] to end? But see, the love of God will
[57:34] help you endure that until it ends.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; And that even means if death is the way
[57:41] that ends.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; That's the love of God. Remember I told
[57:46] you that story about the preacher? He
[57:48] and I haven't emailed for months, but I
[57:50] don't know Vang if you remember me
[57:51] telling this story, but there's a
[57:53] preacher. He married a woman who had
[57:55] been divorced before before he came in
[57:56] the message. He come to the message.
[57:59] He's married to an adulterer. Basically,
[58:00] he's basically an adulterer. And he as
[58:02] soon as he hears the message, I'm called
[58:04] to preach.
[58:05] Church, what does he do? He waits 40 or
[58:08] 50 years till that woman dies. He
[58:10] doesn't preach, but he knows the whole
[58:12] time I'm called to preach.
[58:14] He just waits on it. Can you imagine
[58:16] waiting 50 years for God to use you?
[58:20] He said, "Finally, the w and" and he
[58:22] wasn't praying for his wife to die. He
[58:23] was praying for her salvation. Now, she
[58:24] was a denominational believer. She never
[58:26] believed the message, though, but she
[58:27] had faith in Christ. So, she died. She
[58:30] marries a woman in the message. I'm
[58:32] sorry. He marries a woman in the
[58:33] message. And now, he starts preaching.
[58:35] And he travels all around the world.
[58:37] He's seeing people saved, healed, filled
[58:39] with the Holy Ghost. He waited 50 years,
[58:42] church.
[58:44] What a testimony that love can bear all
[58:48] things. Brother Jesse, you don't know
[58:50] how long I've waited. Well, I know this
[58:51] man waited 40 or 50 years to preach. I
[58:53] know that.
[58:55] I know he waited 40 or 50 years for a
[58:57] wife that really believed the message.
[58:59] And if he can wait that long, church, we
[59:01] should be able to wait long. If there's
[59:03] something in our life we got to wait on,
[59:05] may God give us the love of God to bear
[59:07] it, to endure it, to trust God that God
[59:11] IS WORKING SOMETHING IN OUR LIFE FOR OUR
[59:13] GOOD.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; And if you want his email address, let
[59:17] me know. If you need to talk to somebody
[59:19] to encourage you,
[59:21] his emails really encouraged me and they
[59:23] made me cry. Amen.
[59:25] Because he like, "Well, I love I enjoy
[59:26] your videos. I enjoy your truth that you
[59:28] preach." And he's like, "Now I can
[59:29] preach that because this testimony. Can
[59:31] I tell you this testimony?" Amen. Praise
[59:33] God. Willing to wait not just one year,
[59:36] not just 10 years, 40 or 50 years for
[59:40] God to move everything in the way. And
[59:42] then the love of God can come into your
[59:45] life and you can do what God's called
[59:48] you to do.
[59:50] I love it. There's nothing like the love
[59:53] of God. And brother Ram said, "This
[59:54] whole world is longing for one thing."
[59:56] What is it, church? The love of God.
[59:59] Brother said, "The whole world wants to
[1:00:01] see somebody who loves the Lord."
[1:00:05] Hallelujah.
[1:00:07] Now remember this quote.
[1:00:09] Satan can copy any gift, any kind of
[1:00:11] manifestation, but he can't love. God is
[1:00:15] love. Satan can't love. Now, he can
[1:00:20] impersonate it, but he doesn't really
[1:00:22] love the truth. In other words, he won't
[1:00:24] obey the truth.
[1:00:26] So, Satan can't suffer long. Satan's not
[1:00:28] kind. He doesn't I'm sorry. He uh he
[1:00:31] envys, right? He vaunts himself up. He
[1:00:33] puts himself up. He behaves himself
[1:00:35] unseemingly. Satan seeks his own. He's
[1:00:38] easily provoked. And I'm talking about
[1:00:40] demons that battle us as well. Demons
[1:00:43] think evil. Think about that, church.
[1:00:46] Think about that. They sold out. Think
[1:00:47] about the demons that fell, Brother
[1:00:49] Chris. A third of the demons left
[1:00:50] heaven. Think about that. They were
[1:00:53] presented with a a sermon by Satan and
[1:00:56] they got convinced. I'll no longer
[1:00:58] worship God's holiness. I'm going to
[1:01:00] give myself fully to death, fully
[1:01:02] destruction. I'm going to sell out my
[1:01:05] soul for death and destruction rather
[1:01:08] than life and love and holiness to God
[1:01:10] Almighty. And church, they can never
[1:01:12] come back.
[1:01:14] What what was what was Satan's sermon
[1:01:16] that morning when he preached that at
[1:01:18] the at this church?
[1:01:20] To convince these holy angels to give
[1:01:23] themselves fully to steal, kill, and
[1:01:26] destroy.
[1:01:28] We know one thing. It was part of
[1:01:30] Satan's beauty. He was so beautiful. He
[1:01:34] was able to paint stealing, killing,
[1:01:35] destroying in such a beautiful light
[1:01:38] that he convinced a third of them.
[1:01:41] Church, let's not steal. Let's not kill.
[1:01:43] Let's not destroy.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's give Let's give away,
[1:01:49] not steal. Let's not kill. Let's heal
[1:01:52] people. Praise God. Hallelujah. Let's
[1:01:54] not destroy. Let's build up. Hallelujah.
[1:01:57] Let's build up people's faith in the
[1:01:58] Lord Jesus Christ. How many want to do
[1:02:00] that today? That's what I'm trying to
[1:02:01] do. Hallelujah. Build up your faith.
[1:02:06] So, Satan does none of these things.
[1:02:07] Satan doesn't rejoice in the truth.
[1:02:09] Satan uh cannot bear all things. He does
[1:02:11] not believe all things. He does not
[1:02:12] hope. He does not endure all things and
[1:02:14] Satan fails.
[1:02:18] And church, I'll close with this because
[1:02:19] I'm at an hour. So, I think I'll just
[1:02:22] close with this thought.
[1:02:24] You know, yesterday as I was studying, I
[1:02:25] just couldn't get away from this
[1:02:26] chapter. I'm like, Paul wrote 16 things
[1:02:30] about the love of God. Where else is
[1:02:33] this in the Bible?
[1:02:36] Where else does anyone else in the Bible
[1:02:38] just when they talk about God, they lay
[1:02:40] out all these beautiful attributes?
[1:02:44] Now, notice when Paul talked about love,
[1:02:46] he didn't talk about speaking in
[1:02:47] tongues.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; He didn't talk about laying hands on the
[1:02:50] sick and they that they shall recover.
[1:02:52] When Paul talked about love, he didn't
[1:02:54] talk about getting oil out and anointing
[1:02:56] the sick, although that's a good thing.
[1:03:00] What'd he talk about? He talked about
[1:03:02] your actions towards others. What'd he
[1:03:05] talk about, church? She talked about
[1:03:06] your character.
[1:03:10] So, what is your character like today?
[1:03:13] Is it a loving character
[1:03:15] or is it the other side we looked at?
[1:03:19] What's your true character?
[1:03:21] True character.
[1:03:25] Sounds like I got everybody's attention.
[1:03:27] Hallelujah. That's what I want to do. Is
[1:03:30] there any other Bible passage that
[1:03:31] speaks after this? And I found one that
[1:03:34] I think is is similar.
[1:03:36] Moses
[1:03:40] church.
[1:03:44] I thought about this. And if you got
[1:03:46] your Bibles, go to uh Exodus 33 and just
[1:03:48] hold it there. We'll read a few verses.
[1:03:56] Exodus 33:18.
[1:04:07] Exodus 33:18.
[1:04:17] I hope this will be a good thought here
[1:04:18] as we end up by God's grace.
[1:04:26] Now in Exodus 33:18, Moses said, "And he
[1:04:30] said, I beseech thee, show me thy
[1:04:33] glory."
[1:04:35] Now this is one verse, but this is a
[1:04:37] powerful verse to me.
[1:04:40] Here in Moses, we see Moses getting the
[1:04:43] same experience Paul had. Think about
[1:04:46] that, church. If you were going to
[1:04:47] describe God to somebody at your work at
[1:04:51] Ripman Orchards
[1:04:56] or your school that you go to, how would
[1:04:58] you describe the love of God to them? If
[1:05:00] you're on the construction site,
[1:05:02] or you're at the high school, Garfield
[1:05:04] High School, how would you describe the
[1:05:05] love of God? And think about this.
[1:05:08] Moses, look, look at these examples.
[1:05:10] Moses talked to God out of a burning
[1:05:13] bush. He talked to God and he says, "Ah,
[1:05:17] I can't talk. I stutter." And God gives
[1:05:19] him all these reasons he shouldn't quit.
[1:05:21] He shouldn't give up and try to try to
[1:05:23] sherk his responsibility.
[1:05:25] So he sees God in a burning bush,
[1:05:27] brother Chris. He sees that. And then he
[1:05:30] sees God turn his staff into a snake.
[1:05:34] He sees God take his hand, normal, bring
[1:05:36] it out leprosy and bring it back the
[1:05:39] same. He sees God give him thus sayith
[1:05:42] the Lord for 10 plagues.
[1:05:47] HE SEES GOD PUT DARKNESS on the whole
[1:05:49] world or all of Egypt except for Shiloh.
[1:05:54] He hears directly from God. Call fleas,
[1:05:57] right? Call for frogs.
[1:06:01] Call for the death angel. All 10
[1:06:04] plagues. Moses sees all these things.
[1:06:06] And then and then God hears Moses say,
[1:06:08] "Stand still and see the salvation of
[1:06:10] the Lord. Raise your staff." And he sees
[1:06:12] the waters move back. And he walks on
[1:06:15] dry ground.
[1:06:19] And then he sees the pillar of fire.
[1:06:21] Brother Claude, it was before them. But
[1:06:23] then he sees it. It goes behind.
[1:06:27] So he goes,
[1:06:29] "Goodness."
[1:06:32] He's seeing God all over the place.
[1:06:35] He's seeing God in his entire life and
[1:06:37] ministry,
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; but he still asks, "God, show me your
[1:06:45] glory." What? You haven't SEEN THE GLORY
[1:06:48] OF GOD YET, MOSES? OH, my church. I hope
[1:06:51] hope this strikes somebody today like it
[1:06:52] strikes me. Amen. In other words, all
[1:06:54] the miracles in brothers ministry, all
[1:06:56] the miracles we've seen in our lives,
[1:06:58] all the great things that God has done,
[1:07:00] all the tongues, interpretation, the
[1:07:02] prophecies, the healings, whatever God
[1:07:04] has done, the wisdom, the discernment,
[1:07:06] the knowledge, the understanding, the
[1:07:08] dreams, the visions, all these great
[1:07:10] things, they still leave us with the
[1:07:12] HUNGER TO KNOW WHAT IS GOD'S GLORY.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; There must be MORE TO GOD. THANK GOD FOR
[1:07:18] THE GIFTS, BUT THERE MUST BE MORE TO the
[1:07:20] gifts. There's the giver of the gifts.
[1:07:22] Hallelujah.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:28] And now, church, think how much maybe
[1:07:30] you or us or other people in the
[1:07:31] message, we long for supernatural
[1:07:33] wonders like this. Moses saw the hand of
[1:07:37] God, brother Chris, come down and write
[1:07:39] on two tables of stone the ten
[1:07:42] commandments. Thou shalt have no other
[1:07:43] gods before me. Thou shalt not take the
[1:07:45] name of the Lord thy God in vain. Thou
[1:07:46] shalt honor thy mother and father. Thou
[1:07:47] shall not steal. Thou shalt not kill.
[1:07:49] Thou shalt not bear false witness. not
[1:07:50] shall not coveret thy neighbor's wife
[1:07:52] and the neighbor's uh cattle and all
[1:07:54] this. He sees all that
[1:07:58] and then he still says, "God, show me
[1:08:00] your glory."
[1:08:03] After all that, he still wants to know,
[1:08:06] "God, what is your glory?"
[1:08:09] I would think enough I I would think
[1:08:11] you've already seen enough of God's
[1:08:12] glory, haven't you,
[1:08:15] church? He got to see the presence of
[1:08:16] God and remember his face shined and he
[1:08:19] looks he looked like Jose does right
[1:08:20] now. Everybody look at Jose right now.
[1:08:21] That's what Moses looked like.
[1:08:22] [laughter]
[1:08:24] Hallelujah. But he would have been a a
[1:08:25] younger man. He would have been 80s
[1:08:28] in those days. They were healthier than
[1:08:29] we are. You know, you still would have
[1:08:31] had the dark hair, black hair, whatever
[1:08:32] it may be. But he goes in the presence
[1:08:35] OF GOD FOR 40 DAYS and he comes back
[1:08:37] glowing and still he says, "Show me your
[1:08:41] glory, God."
[1:08:42] See church, there's an element to being
[1:08:44] a Christian. No matter how much
[1:08:46] supernatural, no matter how many
[1:08:48] wonderful things we experience, there's
[1:08:50] still a desire. I want to know God's
[1:08:52] heart.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; I want to know God's true character.
[1:08:59] I just don't want to see what God does.
[1:09:01] I want to talk to God and I want to know
[1:09:03] his heart.
[1:09:06] That's what Moses had.
[1:09:09] So, who knows the story?
[1:09:14] In verse 20, Exodus 33:20, and he said,
[1:09:17] "Thou cannot see my face, for there
[1:09:20] shall no man see my face and live."
[1:09:22] Verse 21, the Lord said, "Behold,
[1:09:24] there's a place by me, and thou shalt
[1:09:26] stand upon a rock.
[1:09:29] And it shall come to pass while my glory
[1:09:32] passeth by that I will put thee in a
[1:09:35] cliff of the rock." So God tells him to
[1:09:38] stand on the rock, but then I'll put you
[1:09:40] in a secret place in the rock
[1:09:43] because when I pass by,
[1:09:46] if you're not covered, you'll die
[1:09:50] because of my glory
[1:09:55] and will cover thee with my hand while I
[1:09:58] pass by. So it's like he put him in
[1:10:00] there and then he's going to walk by
[1:10:02] like this. I'm going to show you my
[1:10:03] glory.
[1:10:08] Every everybody understand
[1:10:10] after seeing all these things, all these
[1:10:12] miracles, all this mighty things, the
[1:10:15] supernatural God, he still desires to
[1:10:17] see more of God. And God said, I'll show
[1:10:19] you my glory.
[1:10:26] Verse 23, and I will take away mine
[1:10:28] hand, and thou shalt see my back parts,
[1:10:30] but my face shall not be seen. Church,
[1:10:33] this is quite an amazing thought here.
[1:10:35] God said at the very end, brother
[1:10:37] brother Claude, God said at the very
[1:10:38] end, I'll take away my hand and you can
[1:10:40] see the backside of me, my theophony.
[1:10:44] Amen. THE SAME ONE JOHN SAW. HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:47] The same one Ezekiel saw, THE SAME ONE
[1:10:49] DANIEL SAW, THE ANCIENT OF DAYS. PRAISE
[1:10:52] GOD.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; So Moses saw this before all the other
[1:10:56] prophets. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:11:00] Moses got to see this and he sees the
[1:11:02] glory of God. He sees the backside of a
[1:11:04] theophony
[1:11:06] and he sees the glory of God. But that
[1:11:08] wasn't all he saw. Hallelujah. He saw
[1:11:11] the character of God. Amen. He saw the
[1:11:15] character of Jesus Christ. Go down to
[1:11:17] verse 5 of chapter 34.
[1:11:23] While you're turning there, these were
[1:11:25] all the things Moses saw. He saw the
[1:11:26] burning bush, all the miraculous signs,
[1:11:28] the 10 plagues, pardon the Red Sea, the
[1:11:30] pillar of fire. He saw God on Sinai. He
[1:11:32] saw the writ law written of God. He saw
[1:11:35] the breaking of the tables and Moses
[1:11:36] interceded for them. And then he had
[1:11:39] face-to-face communion in the Holiest of
[1:11:41] Holies.
[1:11:43] He had all these desires and he still
[1:11:46] wanted more of God. Church, if we ever
[1:11:49] get to the spot where we don't want more
[1:11:50] of God, shame on us.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; We are backslided.
[1:11:55] Because Moses saw all that Chris and he
[1:11:57] said, "I'll show me your glory." Like he
[1:11:59] hadn't seen the glory of God. Amen. In
[1:12:02] other words, you can never get enough of
[1:12:04] God. How many people want more of God
[1:12:06] today? Hallelujah.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; We can never get enough OF GOD. AND
[1:12:09] CHURCH, I I believe we'll spend all
[1:12:11] throughout eternity getting more of God
[1:12:13] into our lives.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Because he's the inexhaustible fountain
[1:12:19] of life. He's immeasurable.
[1:12:24] He comes down and covers Moses with his
[1:12:26] hand.
[1:12:29] I'll let you see my backside.
[1:12:31] [laughter] I love it. Don't you? Amen.
[1:12:36] Let's also say this, church.
[1:12:40] The Bible says, "Ask and you shall
[1:12:41] what?"
[1:12:43] So, when was the last time we asked God,
[1:12:45] "Lord, show me your glory.
[1:12:47] Lord, show me something I've never seen
[1:12:49] before.
[1:12:51] Show me your love, God, in in my life.
[1:12:53] Show me your goodness in my life. If
[1:12:56] you're church, if you're questioning
[1:12:57] God's goodness, if you're questioning
[1:12:58] God's love, ask God. Say, God, show me
[1:13:00] your love in my life.
[1:13:03] Show it to me Aresh so I I don't get
[1:13:05] discouraged.
[1:13:07] Remember that the the Lord asked Brother
[1:13:09] Brandham, would you like to go beyond
[1:13:10] the curtain of time? What did Brother
[1:13:12] Ram say? He said, it would help me so
[1:13:14] much if I could just go beyond the
[1:13:16] curtain of time.
[1:13:18] So when you pray, saint, just say,
[1:13:20] 'Lord, it would help me so much if you
[1:13:21] could just give me a dream. How many
[1:13:22] times have I prayed that, brother Chris?
[1:13:24] I've said, God, if I could just see an
[1:13:25] angel, if I could just go beyond the
[1:13:27] curtain of time. I've prayed that
[1:13:28] before. God, if I could just see a
[1:13:30] vision of an angel, it'd help me so
[1:13:32] much. But even if God doesn't do it, I
[1:13:34] still want more of God.
[1:13:37] And church, if I look back at my life, I
[1:13:39] can see how God was so good to me time
[1:13:42] and time again. Like I told you on the
[1:13:44] day Charlie Kirk was shot. I'm driving
[1:13:46] home like what just happened? The man or
[1:13:48] woman swerves at me and just barely
[1:13:51] misses me. I could have died that same
[1:13:52] day. Now I had my seatelt on by God's
[1:13:55] grace.
[1:13:57] But that's just another example of how
[1:13:59] God is so good to us.
[1:14:02] Moses says, "Show me your glory."
[1:14:06] Look at verse five. And the Lord
[1:14:08] descended in the cloud and stood with
[1:14:09] him there and proclaimed the name of the
[1:14:12] Lord. So when you ask for God's glory,
[1:14:15] Lord, I want to see your glory. What's
[1:14:17] he going to give you? His name, his
[1:14:19] attribute, his characteristics.
[1:14:26] Verse six, and the Lord passed before
[1:14:28] him and proclaimed, now look at this,
[1:14:30] the Lord, the Lord God.
[1:14:33] Remember when Jesus said, "Verily,
[1:14:35] verily or Samuel, Samuel." It's
[1:14:38] emphasizing the Lord, the Lord God. I'm
[1:14:41] emphasizing this is my name,
[1:14:44] Jehovah, Adonai. Hallelujah.
[1:14:47] And church, here's And here's just a
[1:14:49] little picture that I This is just one I
[1:14:51] found on the internet. I thought this
[1:14:52] was really nice. So, first Moses, that's
[1:14:55] Moses. First, he would have been
[1:14:56] standing on a rock and then God places
[1:14:58] him in the cliff of the rock.
[1:15:01] Now, it doesn't fit because he can't see
[1:15:03] God. So, Moses should actually be turned
[1:15:05] around. But I just wanted us to see the
[1:15:07] immensity of God. Does everybody
[1:15:08] understand? I just want to see I want
[1:15:10] you to see how great God is.
[1:15:13] God said, "I'm going to put you in a
[1:15:15] little place and I'm going to cover you
[1:15:17] and you're going to see my glory. You're
[1:15:20] going to feel my glory. You're going to
[1:15:21] know my name. You're going to know my
[1:15:23] attributes."
[1:15:25] So, I believe Moses saw the same thing
[1:15:28] that Paul saw.
[1:15:30] saw the same thing Daniel saw. John,
[1:15:32] that's right. That's right. Paul was
[1:15:33] caught up to the third heaven. Praise
[1:15:35] God. Amen. He said, "I I've seen things
[1:15:37] I'm not allowed to utter yet." Praise
[1:15:39] God.
[1:15:42] So, let's look at verse six.
[1:15:45] What does he call him? He says, he
[1:15:47] proclaimed the name. And I love this.
[1:15:50] God said, "I'm going to proclaim my
[1:15:52] name. I'm going to give you my fame. I'm
[1:15:55] going to tell you my glory. I'm going to
[1:15:57] tell you this is my reputation.
[1:16:00] So what is God's glory? His reputation.
[1:16:04] Amen. What is God's glory? Who he is.
[1:16:08] How he treats us. Brother Chris, that is
[1:16:10] God's glory to us. Amen. His name is HIS
[1:16:13] GLORY. WHY IS GOD FAMOUS? HE'S GOING TO
[1:16:16] TELL US. Brother Austin, why is Jesus
[1:16:18] famous?
[1:16:20] [laughter] Hallelujah. Amen. He's famous
[1:16:23] because he's merciful. I'm just going to
[1:16:26] skip ahead. Why is Jesus famous? He's
[1:16:28] merciful.
[1:16:30] He's gracious.
[1:16:32] He's long-suffering. Now, that ought to
[1:16:34] sound familiar.
[1:16:37] Charity suffereth.
[1:16:40] Oh, now we see the connection.
[1:16:42] Now, we see both Paul and Moses,
[1:16:47] they knew the love of God. They knew
[1:16:49] God's character. Amen. They knew God's
[1:16:52] glory.
[1:16:54] What is God's glory? It's his
[1:16:56] attributes. It's his heart. David was a
[1:16:58] man after the heart of God. This is
[1:17:00] God's heart. This is God's character.
[1:17:03] This is how God treats his children.
[1:17:07] And this is what God tells Moses. I'm
[1:17:10] merciful. I'm famous for being gracious.
[1:17:14] I'm famous for being long-suffering.
[1:17:17] I'm famous for having abundant goodness.
[1:17:21] I'm famous because I'm the truth. I'm
[1:17:25] the way, the truth, and the life.
[1:17:27] Hallelujah.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; I'm famous because I keep mercy for
[1:17:31] thousands of people.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; That's what he That's what he shouts,
[1:17:34] brother Chris, to Moses when he passed
[1:17:36] by. That's why I'm famous.
[1:17:39] I'm famous because I forgive the
[1:17:41] iniquities. And I'm going to forgive the
[1:17:43] iniquities of many more.
[1:17:45] I'm going to forgive you, Moses, of
[1:17:47] murder. I'm going to forgive you of not
[1:17:49] circumcising your sons.
[1:17:52] That's my glory.
[1:17:55] God's glory is that he doesn't give us
[1:17:57] the punishment we deserve.
[1:18:02] He said, "My glory is I forgive
[1:18:04] transgressions. I forgive sins." Because
[1:18:07] remember these are different, right?
[1:18:08] Iniquities, transgressions, sins.
[1:18:09] There's differences in there.
[1:18:12] Hallelujah.
[1:18:15] and my glory. Why I'm famous. I will not
[1:18:19] clear the guilty. But yet the Bible said
[1:18:22] he's a God ready to pardon. So if he's
[1:18:25] ready to forgive and sinners won't
[1:18:27] confess those serpent seed, then he will
[1:18:29] not clear them because they didn't come
[1:18:31] the same way that you came by
[1:18:33] repentance.
[1:18:34] You came by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:18:37] That's what God is famous for. God will
[1:18:41] treat everyone the same. God will be
[1:18:44] impartial. God will judge by one thing
[1:18:46] alone. That's his word.
[1:18:49] And he will visit the iniquity of the
[1:18:52] fathers upon children and upon
[1:18:55] children's children unto the third and
[1:18:58] fourth generation.
[1:19:01] Right? We saw that with uh Levi paid
[1:19:04] tithe while he was in the loins of
[1:19:05] Abraham.
[1:19:07] So God, brother Chris, God visits the
[1:19:09] blessings on four generations.
[1:19:12] So think about that. If time carries,
[1:19:13] brother Chris, you would have children,
[1:19:15] grandchildren, great-grandchildren.
[1:19:17] God's your obedience to God will bless
[1:19:19] your great grandchildren.
[1:19:22] Hallelujah. I'm happy to know that. I I
[1:19:24] can already see my bless or God's
[1:19:25] blessings on my children. And what about
[1:19:27] when what about when I get
[1:19:28] grandchildren? PRAISE GOD. GOD PROMISED
[1:19:30] ME, CHURCH. God promised you, brother
[1:19:32] Jose. I'm sure you've seen it in your
[1:19:34] grandchildren, brother. Do you have
[1:19:36] great grandchildren yet, brother? You
[1:19:38] do. Hallelujah. Amen. You can see God's
[1:19:40] blessing. Amen.
[1:19:41] God promised it. He said, "I won't
[1:19:43] forgive them for four generations, but
[1:19:45] I'll also bless them for four
[1:19:47] generations. I'll see the tithes that
[1:19:50] Levi will pay. I already see it in
[1:19:53] Abraham by predestination."
[1:19:55] In other words, if you serve God, God's
[1:19:57] going to save some of your children. God
[1:20:00] notice I didn't say all because God
[1:20:01] didn't save Jacob and or Esau as well.
[1:20:04] God saved Jacob, not Esau. He didn't
[1:20:07] promise to save all of them. He promised
[1:20:09] to save the predestinated.
[1:20:12] But if you serve God, your children,
[1:20:14] grandchildren, great grandchildren will
[1:20:16] be blessed by by by the grace of God
[1:20:19] that God has given to you. God will see
[1:20:21] your faithful service and God will honor
[1:20:23] four generations past you. That's God's
[1:20:26] fame. Amen. That's what makes him
[1:20:29] famous, brother Claude.
[1:20:32] Show me your glory. I want to see the
[1:20:34] Red Sea. Moses has already seen that.
[1:20:35] God said, I'm going to give him some
[1:20:37] something better than the Red Sea.
[1:20:39] AMEN. I'M GOING TO GIVE HIM MY MERCY TO
[1:20:42] FOUR GENERATIONS. HALLELUJAH. That's
[1:20:45] greater than the Red Sea.
[1:20:47] That's greater than seeing a
[1:20:48] supernatural vision of riding on stone.
[1:20:51] It's greater than that if God shows
[1:20:53] mercy to my children and my
[1:20:55] grandchildren and my great
[1:20:57] grandchildren. What would you rather
[1:20:59] have? An experience or generations have
[1:21:02] experiences of the love of God and
[1:21:04] eternal life?
[1:21:07] I think you know my answer. I'd rather
[1:21:09] have eternal life and God's mercy upon
[1:21:13] generations of eternal life. So the blue
[1:21:16] is the blue is the is the similarities
[1:21:18] between 1 Corinthians 13
[1:21:22] and uh Exodus 34.
[1:21:26] See how God's merciful? He's not easily
[1:21:28] provoked. He's merciful. See how God is
[1:21:31] gracious or kind. See how God is
[1:21:34] longsuffering and Paul says he suffers a
[1:21:36] long time.
[1:21:39] Moses was told by God, "I'm the God of
[1:21:41] truth." And what does love do? It
[1:21:43] rejoices in the truth.
[1:21:48] What does God do? He keeps mercy for
[1:21:50] thousands. And what does charity do? It
[1:21:53] can bear all things. And in fact,
[1:21:55] church, Jesus bore all of our sins on
[1:21:58] the cross. That's what love does. Love
[1:22:02] can put up with people. Love can forgive
[1:22:04] people. Love can bear each other's
[1:22:07] burdens.
[1:22:12] Let's stand to our feet. Musicians can
[1:22:13] come. Let's read these last verses.
[1:22:17] So God passes Moses by. He declares his
[1:22:20] glory. As if the Red Sea wasn't enough,
[1:22:22] the burning bush was enough. God lets
[1:22:25] him see the back of the theophony. And
[1:22:27] let's see how Moses responds to the
[1:22:29] glory of God. I hope you'll res respond
[1:22:31] the same way today.
[1:22:34] How does Moses respond when he sees
[1:22:36] God's glory?
[1:22:38] Does he say, "Oh, that was another good
[1:22:39] service. I'll just go home and
[1:22:42] I'll just get back to get back to doing
[1:22:45] the dishes or whatever I got to do."
[1:22:47] Church, what does he do?
[1:22:50] He makes haste and bowed his head toward
[1:22:53] the earth and worshiped. So, what will
[1:22:56] you go? What will you do today, church?
[1:22:57] You should go home and worship God on
[1:22:59] the way home.
[1:23:01] I should worship God on the way home.
[1:23:05] If the glory of God ever passes you by,
[1:23:07] you'll want to worship God. What night
[1:23:10] was I was is 9 or 10 o'clock in Haven's
[1:23:13] in the kitchen shouting the praises of
[1:23:15] God with her ear earphones in praising
[1:23:18] God. I'm like, this is refreshing.
[1:23:20] [laughter]
[1:23:21] Not my other children have done that
[1:23:22] before, but it just struck me. Was that
[1:23:24] Wednesday or Thursday night? Haven, I
[1:23:25] can't remember. But she's singing at the
[1:23:27] top of almost at the top of her lungs
[1:23:29] here and it's almost bedtime. I'm like,
[1:23:30] "Hallelujah." She must have seen the
[1:23:33] glory of God.
[1:23:35] Amen. In other words, just appreciate.
[1:23:38] We appreciate the love of God. We
[1:23:40] appreciate the character of Jesus
[1:23:41] Christ. And it makes me want to worship
[1:23:44] God. Makes me want to put my favorite
[1:23:46] song on, bring you to tears in the car.
[1:23:51] When God's glory passes by, you've got
[1:23:53] to respond by worshiping God.
[1:23:57] Hallelujah. I love this. And he said,
[1:23:59] "Now, if I have found grace in thy
[1:24:02] sight, oh Lord, let my Lord, I pray
[1:24:06] thee, go among us."
[1:24:10] Lord, just be with our church. How many,
[1:24:13] how many want that today? Lord, just be
[1:24:15] with my family.
[1:24:18] You know why? For we are a stiff necked
[1:24:21] people sometimes.
[1:24:24] And pardon our iniquity and our sin and
[1:24:27] take us for thine inheritance.
[1:24:30] Lord, let my family be your inheritance.
[1:24:34] Let my children, grandchildren, great
[1:24:37] grandchildren, let my family be your
[1:24:40] family.
[1:24:42] Hallelujah. How many appreciate Moses
[1:24:44] today by God's grace? He saw the same
[1:24:47] thing Paul did. He saw the character of
[1:24:50] God Almighty. Amen. Let's bow our heads.
[1:24:55] Father God, we're thankful for today,
[1:24:56] Lord God.
[1:25:07] Lord, I just find it so striking that
[1:25:09] Moses, a man that was accustomed to
[1:25:12] miracles, when he asked to see your
[1:25:14] glory, you showed him your theophony.
[1:25:18] And you showed him your character
[1:25:26] and it was such a movement that it
[1:25:28] caused him to worship you and say, "God,
[1:25:31] stay among us. God, don't leave us.
[1:25:38] Let my family be your inheritance." In
[1:25:40] other words, adopt us into your family,
[1:25:44] oh God. That's our prayer today, Lord
[1:25:45] God.
[1:25:47] Help us to have a heart of worship
[1:25:49] today, Lord God. Hallelujah.
[1:25:53] You are so good, so merciful, gracious,
[1:25:56] and kind,
[1:25:58] keeping [music] mercy unto thousands.
[1:26:01] Oh God, forgiving transgressions,
[1:26:05] iniquities, and sins.
[1:26:07] Hallelujah.
[1:26:13] Lord, let your glory pass [music] by
[1:26:14] this morning, Lord God. We ask it,
[1:26:16] Jesus.
[1:26:21] And Lord, may it cause us to worship
[1:26:23] that we'll take that worship with us,
[1:26:25] [music] Lord God.
[1:26:28] And we'll keep your presence in our
[1:26:30] homes in and [music] in this church as
[1:26:32] well, Lord God.
[1:26:37] Lord, your presence was with us at the
[1:26:38] park yesterday when I got to talk to
[1:26:40] that gentleman [music] and he said,
[1:26:42] "This makes me want to cry that there's
[1:26:43] actually a Christian who loves the Lord
[1:26:45] and loves the Bible."
[1:26:48] Hallelujah, Lord God. Thank you, Lord
[1:26:52] God. The footsteps of the righteous are
[1:26:54] order of the Lord.
[1:26:59] If Paul could come back today, if Moses
[1:27:01] [music] would come back today and we'd
[1:27:02] say, "What is the glory of God?" God, he
[1:27:04] would say it's God's character.
[1:27:07] Suffers long, bears all things, hopes
[1:27:09] all things, believes all things,
[1:27:11] rejoices in the truth, does not rejoice
[1:27:13] in iniquity.
[1:27:17] It's merciful and gracious,
[1:27:20] and it will bless your children,
[1:27:23] grandchildren, and great grandchildren.
[1:27:26] Oh God, thank you for this revelation
[1:27:28] today. Lord God, I believe it is how
[1:27:31] Paul and Moses saw the same [music]
[1:27:33] thing. The glory of God, both caught up
[1:27:37] into the heavenlies,
[1:27:39] saw heavenly visions, heavenly [music]
[1:27:41] paradise.
[1:27:44] God, we just want to return and worship
[1:27:46] you today, Lord God.
[1:27:49] Hallelujah. We love you today, Lord God.
[1:27:52] Your love is so great.
[1:27:56] Your mercy is so measurless, Lord God,
[1:28:00] reaches [music] to the highest mountain,
[1:28:02] flows through the lowest valley.
[1:28:06] Lord, I pray your people, Lord, will
[1:28:07] [music] experience the glory of God
[1:28:09] today, and they'll take their worship
[1:28:11] home with them, Lord God.
[1:28:19] Hallelujah. Lord, show us your glory.
[1:28:24] Show us your character.
[1:28:27] Hallelujah. [music]
