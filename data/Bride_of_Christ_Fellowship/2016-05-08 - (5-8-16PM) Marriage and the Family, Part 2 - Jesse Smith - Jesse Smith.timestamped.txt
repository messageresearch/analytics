[22:38] [Music]
[22:46] heart
[22:48] hallelujah praise God speak house of the
[22:50] Lord tonight let's take our Bibles to
[22:52] Colossians chapter 3 tonight by the
[22:54] grace of
[22:55] God well yesterday was I was studying I
[22:57] was trying to decide what the Lord would
[22:58] have me to preach I felt you know to go
[23:01] back to marriage and uh and then brother
[23:03] Stephen preached numerous things I
[23:05] already had in my notes I was very happy
[23:06] about that and I thought that was a
[23:09] confirmation by God's grace so i' like
[23:12] to preach on marriage in the family part
[23:14] two tonight I thoroughly enjoyed this
[23:16] morning uh but Stephen really followed
[23:18] the leading of the Lord I thought that
[23:19] was just such a wonderful thing and
[23:21] there's a whole great testimony behind
[23:23] it U but it was a real special time this
[23:26] morning I just we really really blessed
[23:30] I have to tell it to you sometime once
[23:31] everything everything else needs to
[23:33] happen happens and I will by God's grace
[23:37] just a wonderful testimony so um
[23:39] Colossians chapter 3 please let's look
[23:42] at um marriage and family of let's go to
[23:45] verse 18 here last Sunday morning we
[23:48] looked we focused mostly on the men
[23:50] we're going to keep doing that a little
[23:51] bit this morning and looking at the
[23:52] man's role in the marriage in the family
[23:55] because he's the head of the family and
[23:57] and uh de a little bit more of that and
[23:59] then we're going to get to parts of the
[24:00] book here we we offered this to every
[24:03] couple of the church last Sunday if
[24:04] you'd like to read this book it's the
[24:06] best book I've ever read on marriage the
[24:08] best one I've read quite a few probably
[24:11] seven or eight or nine maybe somewhere
[24:13] around there and it's the best book I've
[24:15] ever read on marriage and it transformed
[24:17] my marriage because it has Bible PR
[24:19] Bible principles in it and everything it
[24:21] said in here about specific things
[24:23] brother brandom said to do too so I like
[24:26] that amen I like that by God's grace um
[24:30] it's just a really really great book so
[24:34] Colossians
[24:36] 3:18 wives submit yourselves unto your
[24:39] own
[24:40] husbands as it is fit in the
[24:44] Lord verse 19 husbands love your wives
[24:48] and be not bitter against
[24:51] them children obey your parents in all
[24:55] things for this is well pleasing
[24:58] unto the Lord fathers provoke not your
[25:02] children to anger lest they be
[25:04] discouraged and that means disheartened
[25:07] you don't want to see children that are
[25:09] disheartened or
[25:12] spiritless so quite a responsibility we
[25:15] all have don't we as we look at our
[25:17] families wives have responsibilities
[25:19] husbands children and then he addresses
[25:21] men again as fathers he dresses them so
[25:24] let's have word of prayer if you have
[25:25] need on your heart just make it know to
[25:26] god let's bow our heads here
[25:28] and let's pray together one more time
[25:30] Heavenly Father we're grateful Lord
[25:31] again for this Fellowship we're grateful
[25:33] for all the saints Lord and most of all
[25:35] we're grateful for you giv us life
[25:37] natural and eternal life Lord to think
[25:40] this life with inside of us will never
[25:41] end dear God it goes beyond my
[25:44] comprehension but Lord by faith I
[25:46] believe it and I Know It Lord because
[25:49] Lord you manifested yourself in many
[25:50] ways through your word through nature
[25:52] through Supernatural miracles signs of
[25:54] Wonders experiences Lord You've
[25:56] Vindicated your yourself Lord to us so
[25:58] many times and we thank you for that
[26:01] speak to us here tonight Lord bless
[26:02] these Saints as we Fellowship around
[26:05] your word bless those that are live
[26:06] streaming as well Lord I pray you just
[26:08] change our hearts and lives to become
[26:09] more like you in Jesus Christ's name
[26:12] everybody said amen God bless you being
[26:14] seated there praise
[26:19] God yeah so a great testimony this
[26:21] morning you know having brother Stephen
[26:23] here and just a what wonderful word of
[26:25] God that was and uh that was such a
[26:28] blessing so let's look at this morning
[26:31] here or this evening sorry about
[26:32] marriage and family part two I think
[26:34] it'll be really blessed by this message
[26:37] next Sunday just let you know we're
[26:38] going to dedicate little Victoria I know
[26:40] she's three months old but I just forgot
[26:41] to have her dedicated so U but it worked
[26:44] out good because Kristen's mother always
[26:45] likes to come when we're having the baby
[26:47] dedication so next Sunday morning my
[26:49] mother-in-law will be here and uh she
[26:52] don't believe the message yet but we're
[26:54] praying that she might and uh my plan
[26:57] you know my leading was to preach on
[26:58] marriage and family next week so I hope
[27:00] I hope that will touch her heart and you
[27:04] know one time brother Gabe Smith
[27:05] preached here when my mother-in-law was
[27:07] here and I wasn't here I think I was out
[27:08] of town ministering somewhere else my
[27:10] wife said that the Lord truly discerned
[27:13] for mother's heart and uh so obviously
[27:17] our mother my mother-in-law knows God
[27:20] speaks here you know uh because it
[27:22] totally discerned her life um but we're
[27:25] looking for fruits you know we're
[27:26] looking for uh real repentance and
[27:29] things like that we want that in all of
[27:30] our family lives don't you still pray
[27:32] for your your your unsafe family you
[27:34] ought to we ought to bring them before
[27:36] the Lord and uh like brother man said uh
[27:40] repeat the promise remind God of his
[27:42] promise you said thy and thy house
[27:43] should be saved I like what brother
[27:45] Stephen said this morning the violent
[27:46] take it by force if it looks like it's
[27:47] not going to happen then you just plead
[27:49] to God even more you know do something
[27:51] about it brother R said part of
[27:53] Christianity is going after them doing
[27:54] something about the Lost not just
[27:56] sitting back and doing nothing but at
[27:58] some point going out and uh trying to
[28:01] impact their lives I know when Simon
[28:04] heard the message and I had never heard
[28:05] the message Simon literally talked me
[28:08] over and over like you've got to sit
[28:10] down and listen to the sermon like he
[28:12] just basically begged me to do it like
[28:14] almost like forcing me as an older
[28:16] brother you know I was like oh sure s
[28:18] sure you know I just thought it was just
[28:19] another sermon when I heard that sermon
[28:21] my jaw about dropped I never heard any
[28:24] man preach like that uh and was brother
[28:26] Chris Hall I preached on serpent seed so
[28:29] I never forget that first message I
[28:30] heard of serpent seed that saw it
[28:32] immediately um don't understand didn't
[28:35] understand everything you know but
[28:36] certainly saw it right away so that's
[28:39] what I'm saying at some point you know
[28:41] we got to follow the leading of the Lord
[28:42] and know when to approach family members
[28:45] about certain things so that's just one
[28:48] example like I said you know last month
[28:51] uh I sent out 27 packets to everybody on
[28:54] my mother's side and my aunt you know uh
[28:58] thank me for my cousin thank me for it
[28:59] said he read it I I need to follow up
[29:01] with them and see if they did uh you of
[29:03] course Satan's probably trying to snatch
[29:04] that seed out of their hearts but uh my
[29:07] my aunt even commented what beautiful
[29:09] tracks they were beautiful you know
[29:11] things like that so they definitely
[29:12] looked at them and church just like
[29:14] brother BR said that man reach in his
[29:15] pocket and said where will you spend
[29:17] eternity he said that's where he receive
[29:20] salvation he he realized it because he
[29:22] started searching for it he was
[29:23] hungering for it yeah brother said when
[29:25] when when your heart turned and you got
[29:27] desperate and started seeking he said
[29:29] that's when it that's when it started to
[29:30] happen right there so and one of those
[29:33] tracks I I made sure I bought the one
[29:34] that said where will you spend eternity
[29:36] on
[29:37] it brother random said that one worked
[29:40] uh because brother R said that's all
[29:42] you're called to do pass the
[29:45] [Music]
[29:46] track times he condemns people for
[29:48] that's all they do is pass tracks right
[29:52] if you're supposed to do more on you but
[29:56] if
[30:07] he said have a purpose in life and go do
[30:09] something he said I like somebody that
[30:11] knows what they're doing yeah he said I
[30:12] like somebody that's about the father's
[30:14] business that has something to do for
[30:15] the kingdom of God do something make
[30:18] clothes for little babies or uh right
[30:21] write write letters to family members or
[30:23] you know do something do do something I
[30:25] don't know do something raise your like
[30:27] said teach your children or you know
[30:29] call and pray pray and fast for people
[30:31] do something for the kingdom of God and
[30:33] God will bless you for that how many
[30:34] believe that amen you know uh it's kind
[30:37] of easy for me as far as you know
[30:39] knowing what to do I'm supposed to
[30:40] preach I'm supposed to teach that's easy
[30:42] for me uh but if I wasn't preaching I'd
[30:45] have to seek God and find out okay
[30:47] that's what God helps us to understand
[30:49] so I just want to let you know next
[30:50] Sunday morning um I'll be preaching and
[30:54] uh Victoria be dedicated there and then
[30:56] I'll be preach in the evening service as
[30:58] well I told I said that brother John was
[30:59] going to preach but he let me know he's
[31:00] not able to preach next Sunday night so
[31:02] I'll be preaching uh probably rest of
[31:05] the services until we get to our June
[31:07] 10th anniversary meetings so looking
[31:09] forward to that I was working on a
[31:11] little slideshow I got all these
[31:12] pictures from like
[31:14] 2004 2002 or you know when we first
[31:16] heard the message and I put them on a
[31:18] slideshow we're so we're probably G to
[31:19] show that one of those days so have
[31:21] brother Samuel Browning coming brother
[31:23] cam brother Isaiah brother Craig Bo so
[31:25] you have those four brothers coming to
[31:27] Minister I just can't wait I'm just
[31:29] going to be spiritually fed there by
[31:30] God's grace looking forward to that by
[31:33] God's grace so looking forward to it
[31:35] amen so let's look at this here uh we
[31:38] took our text in Colossians 3 uh 18
[31:41] through
[31:42] 21 and I wanted to take that because it
[31:45] talks I like what it said how it talked
[31:47] to the husbands and the
[31:49] fathers because of course not every
[31:51] husband is a father but most husbands a
[31:52] lot of husbands turn out to be fathers
[31:54] so I want to make sure I I uh emphasize
[31:57] that husbands love your wives and be not
[32:00] bitter against them now we know the
[32:02] Bible said the flesh is enmity against
[32:04] the spirit how many remember that from
[32:06] Galatians the flesh what your flesh
[32:08] wants to do is hatred or enmity against
[32:11] the holy spirit so the holy spirit says
[32:14] husbands love so husbands does your
[32:17] flesh always want to love of course not
[32:19] that's why the holy spirit's got to tell
[32:20] you to do that sisters and wives is it
[32:23] always easy to submit does your flesh
[32:25] always want to submit probably
[32:28] not right you don't have to say Amen
[32:31] it's one of those Family Services you
[32:32] don't have to say Amen because I know
[32:33] it's it's deep and it's personal I know
[32:35] that that's good but these are the
[32:38] things this church this really brings
[32:39] Christ into your home when you start
[32:41] preaching on family you really see What
[32:43] You're Made Of that's the real you right
[32:45] we can put on a show we could like a
[32:47] brother said this morning we can act you
[32:48] can put up a mail act like everything's
[32:50] okay but our home life brother said you
[32:53] live your best and your worst at home so
[32:55] we want to try to decrease the worst and
[32:57] increase the
[32:58] best is that right that's what we want
[33:01] to do
[33:03] um and I want the people I want to love
[33:06] me and respect me the most are the ones
[33:08] I'm living with I've got to constantly
[33:10] battle that for example I always want
[33:12] the church people to love me and but
[33:14] sometimes if I don't if I put all my
[33:15] focus on the church people and serving
[33:17] them and studying and praying or trying
[33:18] to email them or contact them whatever
[33:20] and I lose track of my family that my
[33:22] family doesn't get the love they
[33:24] need right and I've got to find the
[33:26] balance I got to be hospital but I've
[33:28] also got to love my children and love my
[33:30] wife because Paul said Jesse love your
[33:33] wife right so I've got to find the
[33:36] balance on how to do that and it takes
[33:38] the Holy
[33:39] Spirit but let me say like this brother
[33:41] Rand said if you confess your sin he
[33:43] said the person that you confess will
[33:45] think more of you than before how many
[33:47] remember that remember when he lied to
[33:49] the IRS he said the men thought more of
[33:51] him after he
[33:53] repented so if we're honest and sincere
[33:56] in our home right and we make mistakes
[33:58] and I make a mistake with my wife and if
[34:00] I go repent to her for that she'll think
[34:03] more of me afterwards so I guess just by
[34:05] sheer numbers and probability I'm
[34:08] probably gonna sit against my wife more
[34:09] than anybody else right by sheer
[34:12] probability yeah she she's goingon to
[34:14] see my weak spots but the more I go and
[34:16] repent to her the more I humble myself
[34:19] the more I obey the leadership of the
[34:20] Holy Spirit also the more shall think of
[34:23] me how many can say Amen to that just by
[34:27] your numbers like I apologize in my
[34:29] class you know once a month I I'll say
[34:31] something wrong or you say Okay children
[34:33] will you forgive me and they yeah of
[34:34] course Mr Smith we love you we forgive
[34:36] you you know and you know you know I
[34:38] don't really sin against them as far as
[34:39] I know I'm not convicted of it but I I
[34:43] make mistakes I'd apologize my wife on
[34:44] the drive here for you know just for him
[34:47] falling short you know uh but the more
[34:51] we humble ourselves and truly repent the
[34:55] more a Christian will think of you and
[34:57] even a sinner if they're really sincere
[35:00] they really are in touch with their
[35:01] conscience now so that I just want to
[35:03] make sure I state that
[35:05] there so God knew Brothers
[35:09] husbands husbands and fathers God knew
[35:11] it'd be a struggle for us to love our
[35:13] wives and sisters God knew it be a
[35:15] struggle for you to submit to your
[35:16] husbands but he had he put it in there
[35:17] because that's the that's what the Holy
[35:19] Ghost will lead you to do a brother to
[35:21] love and a sister to submit that's what
[35:24] the Holy Ghost is leading us to do how
[35:25] many want to be led into than that I do
[35:28] I'm the first one I'll stand up here I'm
[35:29] the first one I need to love my wife
[35:31] better I need to love my children better
[35:33] yeah I know it am do I do a pretty a
[35:36] good job well I'm probably doing a
[35:37] pretty good job because I'm a spirit
[35:39] called man Le Spirit L man but I know I
[35:41] can do better because I know when I get
[35:44] down into discouraged I know when I go
[35:45] through the dumps and I know when I make
[35:47] mistakes I know it I'm right there when
[35:48] it happens I let it happen because I'm
[35:50] not walk in the spirit but I'm the first
[35:52] one and say that I want to love my wife
[35:55] better I love my children better I want
[35:56] them to see Christ in me because when
[35:58] I'm loving them whose love is it like
[36:00] brother Stephen said this morning is it
[36:01] really my love or his it's his love so
[36:04] when I'm loving my wife and I'm loving
[36:06] my children it's really Christ loving
[36:08] them through me yeah and yes I feel the
[36:11] same right because I have the same
[36:13] Spirit God shares his spirit with me so
[36:15] I to make sure I say that it so Brothers
[36:18] you're going to be battled fathers and
[36:20] husbands you're going to be battled to
[36:22] love it's going to be a battle as you
[36:23] probably know that you've already
[36:24] experienced that but I'm just re
[36:25] rehearsing this
[36:27] God knew it it would be a battle and God
[36:30] and so that's why Paul specifically
[36:31] wrote to the men just love love love you
[36:35] must love and notice the the Bible gives
[36:38] other things that will be tempted to
[36:39] love for example be tempted to love of
[36:41] other women right will we tempted to
[36:44] love the things of the world John said
[36:46] love not the things of the world right
[36:49] he said be not lovers of your own s
[36:51] remember that don't be lovers of your
[36:52] own s don't love yourself don't love the
[36:54] another woman uh the world
[36:57] ourselves but we're to love God right
[36:59] we're to love God with all of our hearts
[37:01] and soul mind and strength so when we're
[37:03] truly loving God with all of our heart
[37:05] soul mind and strength then we'll truly
[37:06] love our family the right way and I
[37:08] found that to be true when I'm truly Ser
[37:10] serving God loving God with all my heart
[37:12] it's easy to love my wife it's easy to
[37:15] love my children when I'm in love with
[37:17] God because I see those are God's
[37:20] they're in God's image praise the lord
[37:23] it's exactly right so see we Brothers we
[37:26] got to love because we're tempted to
[37:27] love other women we're tempted to love
[37:29] the world we're tempted to love
[37:30] ourselves we're tempted to love anything
[37:32] else but we got to love God and love our
[37:35] wives because it's a Temptation it is
[37:38] it's a great temptation all all these
[37:40] are Temptations we must overcome them by
[37:43] the grace of the Lord and as my email
[37:45] said this week I just want to make sure
[37:47] I I read this I wrote this at the top to
[37:49] remind myself if any marriage needs
[37:52] counseling that's why I'm here I'd like
[37:54] to help out also if any uh marriage
[37:57] couple wants to get away and you help
[37:58] you need help financially with getting
[38:00] away I'll be happy to help you with that
[38:02] that's how I just want to support
[38:03] marriages I want marriages to grow in
[38:05] Grace and knowledge of the Lord I
[38:07] believe in that because I'll just share
[38:10] my testimony real quick ask my wife if I
[38:12] could share a little bit about about it
[38:13] on the way here okay my wife and I got
[38:15] married in 2003 uh and uh you know it
[38:19] wasn't long till Lydia came along I'm
[38:21] very thankful for Lydia coming on the
[38:23] scene like brother Bram said they come
[38:24] on the scene uh and then Mal guy came on
[38:27] the scene but when Mal guy was three
[38:29] months old my wife came to me and said
[38:31] you know this is really hard I don't
[38:33] want any more children and now we have
[38:36] six so something must have changed
[38:39] bu yeah a lot changed and know but the
[38:42] reason my wife said that was because I
[38:44] wasn't giv her the love that she
[38:47] needed and here's why I was pastoring
[38:49] well some people say Pastor in part-time
[38:51] any Pastor job is full-time yeah I don't
[38:54] care what anybody says well you know
[38:55] Pastor fulltime
[38:57] I'm pastoring full I preach three times
[38:59] a week I counsel I try to pray with
[39:02] people I try to call them I'm full-time
[39:04] Pastor I don't care what anybody says
[39:06] but I'm Heart part a full-time teacher
[39:08] too um so I'm full-time pastor and
[39:10] full-time teaching and then I was doing
[39:12] graduate work and so since we've been
[39:15] married I've been doing all those things
[39:16] I've done gra 36 graduate hours and then
[39:20] 30 more so I've done 66 graduate hours
[39:24] while having six kids and you know about
[39:26] have six all the whole time but you know
[39:28] anyways what I'm saying is there's a lot
[39:29] on my plate is what I felt like okay but
[39:32] at that time of our life we were so busy
[39:35] I was just so dedicated to the word and
[39:37] my thoughts weren't even thinking about
[39:38] really loving my wife now that I I was
[39:40] faithful to her I loved her of course
[39:42] but I didn't really spend any time
[39:43] meeting her needs her emotional needs
[39:47] and that's important brother said it
[39:49] like I read the quotes last Sunday
[39:51] brother Ram said all these things that
[39:52] are in this book that that are worth
[39:54] preaching he said all it so at that
[39:57] point I think we went somewhere and
[39:58] somebody gave us a book about marriage I
[40:00] don't remember who it was you
[40:02] remember
[40:07] okay oh that's right okay yeah so he
[40:10] asked if we're having date nights so
[40:12] another uh preacher he's he's a preacher
[40:14] in Wadsworth uh they're kind of like a
[40:17] presbyterian uh but they're really sweet
[40:19] people really sweet people and that kind
[40:22] of and for some he gave me a book or
[40:24] something and we started talking and
[40:25] then we found this book His Needs Her
[40:27] Needs uh and that is and then we read
[40:30] this book and this book has been
[40:32] transformational because this this
[40:34] author uh basically says uh whatever you
[40:39] did to get the person to fall in love
[40:41] with you you need to keep doing
[40:43] that uh uh because whatever you were
[40:45] doing to convince them to marry you was
[40:48] what they needed and they just don't
[40:49] need that at the beginning they need
[40:50] that all the way
[40:52] through okay and so that was like mind
[40:56] changing to me I like wow and it just it
[40:58] really revolutionized my thought uh and
[41:01] so that's where we'll get to but that
[41:03] was just a short really short testimony
[41:05] of that ever since then we started doing
[41:07] date nights together like we had a date
[41:08] yesterday that was really great just two
[41:10] hours we just go away for two hours with
[41:12] the baby and talk and it was just really
[41:14] great it just kind of refreshes our
[41:16] batteries helping us to reconnect
[41:17] emotionally and everything like that
[41:19] it's a really wonderful because that's
[41:20] what we used to be do before we got
[41:22] married we used to go on dates right so
[41:25] that's what we do we just enjoy being
[41:27] together and talking and and a lot
[41:29] sometimes it's talking about the future
[41:31] sometimes talking about children
[41:32] sometimes talking about things in the
[41:33] church am I doing this right honey you
[41:36] think I'm preaching okay you know some
[41:37] of my concerns my own battles you know
[41:39] we talk and but that's great for a
[41:42] couple to do that that's wonderful thing
[41:43] to do and that was missing because she
[41:45] needed that that's one of her needs
[41:47] that's one of the five needs for the
[41:48] women and the men have five needs the
[41:51] author got those needs from a thousand
[41:54] counseling sessions and talking with
[41:56] Christ these are Christian couples
[41:58] Christian couples that were having
[41:59] marriage trouble and based upon a
[42:01] thousand uh counseling sessions he found
[42:04] wow there's a common denominator these
[42:06] these five needs are needs of women and
[42:09] these are five needs of men now they
[42:11] might have different priority levels
[42:12] like this man might need this more than
[42:14] he needs that a woman might need this
[42:16] more than that but he found that they
[42:18] most women need these things and most
[42:20] men need these
[42:21] things okay so that's why I said the
[42:23] email I'll support any marriage getaway
[42:25] I'll support uh any counseling I'd be
[42:27] happy to do
[42:29] that because one thing I want to say too
[42:31] how many knew that brother brandom said
[42:32] that Satan taxed the the woman more than
[42:34] the man do anyone know that brother ra
[42:37] said it because he did that at the
[42:39] beginning who' he go after in the Garden
[42:40] of Eden Eve brother R said we must pray
[42:44] for our wives pray for our sisters
[42:47] because he still goes he goes he goes
[42:49] harder after them and I have the quote
[42:50] on here we'll try to get to it
[42:53] eventually because it goes after the
[42:55] weaker one now she's weaker physically
[42:56] but like I said last Sunday she don't
[42:58] have to be weaker spiritually right
[43:01] because both can be saved right now
[43:03] women don't have preaching gifts or
[43:04] whatever more uh at least they shouldn't
[43:06] try to impersonate it like people do so
[43:08] forth like that but they can still be
[43:10] strong in the Lord the full armor of God
[43:12] wasn't just to men it was for men and
[43:15] women right yes the stat for of men just
[43:18] wasn't for men it was for women too
[43:21] those are all qualities all virtues
[43:23] Christians are supposed to have men and
[43:27] I want to read you this brother brandom
[43:28] said I'm sure you know this but brother
[43:30] Bram said read the word some of you
[43:32] don't read the word once a
[43:35] week I'll let you think about that you
[43:38] ought to read chapter after chapter
[43:39] every day meditate if you get your head
[43:42] out of them old magazines and things
[43:44] you're reading now most of us don't read
[43:45] magazines we read our cell phones or
[43:48] desktop
[43:49] computers see if you get your head out
[43:51] of those old I'll say websites and out
[43:54] of this old so many papers and so-called
[43:55] religious
[43:57] literature he said Doctrine is based
[44:00] upon God's word not experience people
[44:02] can have experiences on everything so he
[44:03] just kind of goes off on a different
[44:04] thought I want you to read that he said
[44:06] you should read chapter after chapter
[44:07] you should be reading the word of God
[44:10] now life story
[44:12] 1952 he's start by Abraham Lincoln you
[44:14] probably heard this as well and the only
[44:16] books that we believe that Lincoln ever
[44:17] had until he was 21 years old was the
[44:20] Bible and Fox's book of Martyrs that's
[44:23] what molded that character the books the
[44:27] books he read molded his character now
[44:29] today it's a shame the videos they watch
[44:31] and the apps they play mold their
[44:33] character but it should be the books
[44:35] they read and they should be Godly
[44:38] books praise God now let's apply that we
[44:41] should we read message books yes should
[44:43] we read the Bible that should be our
[44:44] number one reading but on the side like
[44:47] this week I got through seven chapters
[44:49] of this that's the most I've read in a
[44:50] long time outside of the reading the
[44:51] Bible and the message I was like wow I
[44:54] could actually do that you know because
[44:56] I just get distracted and things like
[44:57] that but what I'm saying church if this
[45:00] book has Godly principles then this book
[45:02] will mold my character because brother
[45:05] said whatever you read molds your
[45:07] character now there's a few things in
[45:09] here where he talks you if some of you
[45:11] read it he talks about how women uh will
[45:13] go on a date and wear makeup and you
[45:14] know get their haircut now we know
[45:16] that's just a that's just a a pit that's
[45:19] just a seed just throw the seed out okay
[45:22] right uh we know that and that's not why
[45:25] bu that people read it because it's a
[45:27] very good book uh I'd say 90% of it's
[45:30] outstanding and I never seen a better
[45:32] book on it and like I said it change my
[45:34] marriage so um whatever you read will
[45:37] mold your character so that's why I I I
[45:41] think the brothers need to read some of
[45:42] this too I know I know the brothers work
[45:44] hard and things like that so I said on
[45:45] the email if you don't have a lot of
[45:47] time Read that read those little pages I
[45:48] sent them back it's only like 10 pages
[45:50] and if the Lord's willing next Sunday or
[45:53] next Sunday night and we have more
[45:54] couples here I'm not really ready to to
[45:55] preach it I'll print off some of those
[45:57] and we'll walk through it and you can
[45:58] walk through with your spouse like a
[46:00] marriage conference it'll be our own
[46:02] little akan marriage conference we'll
[46:04] have U because I just don't know who has
[46:07] time to read it on their own and church
[46:09] it's extremely valuable because it's
[46:11] it's learning to love someone with the
[46:13] love of Christ it's it's extremely
[46:16] valuable I I don't even know if I can
[46:18] overemphasize that loving the one that's
[46:21] what I'm get to you later loving the one
[46:23] you vowed to love keeping your vow that
[46:26] you gave God praise the Lord yeah you
[46:30] vowed to God husbands and wives you
[46:33] vowed to God in front of all your
[46:34] friends and family that you would love
[46:36] them until death do you
[46:39] part so I'm trying to help you keep your
[46:42] vow because I want to keep mine ever
[46:45] understand it's exactly needed it's
[46:48] extremely needed it'll bring more Christ
[46:50] into your home who doesn't want that
[46:52] well ra said if you want angels to visit
[46:53] your house better live like an angel you
[46:55] better live holy right so this is
[46:58] helping this will help I believe angels
[47:01] to visit your home amen I believe that
[47:06] okay so let's um go back here I'm sorry
[47:10] in my notes it looks back okay so these
[47:12] sermons here as we had one last week one
[47:14] this week the whole purpose is love
[47:17] because love is the greatest force in
[47:18] the whole universe love is the greatest
[47:21] Force um so these sermons are going to
[47:23] teach us how to love based upon the
[47:25] needs of men
[47:26] women and these needs will help us keep
[47:30] our promises we made on our wedding
[47:32] days you and I promise in front of our
[47:35] family and to almighty God that we would
[47:38] we would love we bought we all of us
[47:40] said that and a man is no better than
[47:42] his word I want to make sure I say that
[47:44] yeah a man or woman is no better than
[47:47] their word look look what brother B said
[47:50] 1951
[47:53] expectations he tells him this is Los
[47:56] Angeles he said if I say I'll meet you
[47:58] there he's talking about special
[47:59] meetings if it all possible I'll do it
[48:02] because a man of his word will be honest
[48:05] and keep his promise let alone a
[48:08] Christian so just a man who's a real man
[48:11] will be honest and keep their promise
[48:14] and that's not even a Christian that's
[48:15] just a man praise God he said I'll be
[48:19] there if I all possibly can because a
[48:21] man keeps his word 1956 hear you him so
[48:25] no man is any better than his word I'm
[48:28] no better than my word brother Bram says
[48:31] you're no better than your word God's no
[48:33] better than his word and his word is
[48:35] part of
[48:36] him amen yeah I hope that helps you by
[48:39] God's grace we're no better than our our
[48:41] word if we keep our word or not do
[48:43] we if we do that we're on the right
[48:46] track all right let me read one
[48:49] more but God's word is ever the truth I
[48:51] always hold on to that and that God's
[48:53] word is always eternally true and no
[48:56] man's word or no man is any better than
[48:58] his word if I don't keep my word then
[49:01] I'm not
[49:02] much I'm not much if I don't keep my
[49:04] word
[49:05] right so God help me first and then God
[49:09] help all of us we say we're gonna do
[49:11] something God help us to do it
[49:13] amen I've been trying to use a lot more
[49:15] Lord willings
[49:17] lately if I can I've also been trying to
[49:20] say remind me if I
[49:23] forget because in the moment I want to
[49:25] do something but if I don't write it
[49:27] down if I don't get it in my inbox it's
[49:29] going to take God to bring it back to me
[49:31] I'll just forget I go from one box I go
[49:33] to the church box on Sunday and then
[49:35] work box Monday to Friday and then I
[49:37] jump back in the well Wednesday night
[49:39] jump back in the church box then
[49:40] Saturday it's all Church box Sunday out
[49:42] Church box and So within that those days
[49:44] where I'm in different boxes sometimes I
[49:47] forget so I really want to be though a
[49:49] man of my word because if I can't keep
[49:51] my word I'm not a man amen right I'm not
[49:53] a godly man I got to keep my word word
[49:56] because God keeps his word amen yes
[50:00] Glory he's the greatest man amen ever
[50:02] was amen yes so these sermons are
[50:06] focused on Love Now I want to drop this
[50:07] little thought in here let's go to
[50:09] proverbs 30 ver 18 this is
[50:15] beautiful proverbs
[50:24] 30:18 and like I said I have quotes for
[50:26] all these and I preach what I think five
[50:28] marriage Banquets on it so I have those
[50:29] slideshows I just I haven't had time to
[50:31] go through all them like I lik I went
[50:33] through two of them I think one of them
[50:35] or two of them and pulled out some good
[50:36] quotes and things like that to rehearse
[50:38] and refresh and I found some new ones
[50:40] too but everything that I preach
[50:42] everything that I'm preaching can be
[50:43] found in the message and it's it might
[50:45] not be specifically say in the Bible
[50:46] like the Bible don't say take out your
[50:47] wife on a date but the Bible says love
[50:51] right and the Bible said dwell with her
[50:53] according to understanding which is a
[50:55] deep understanding of a woman's needs in
[50:57] the Greek so what does a woman need well
[51:01] we try to love her like that you know uh
[51:03] that's what we should do so Proverbs
[51:05] 30:8 I love this there be three things
[51:08] which are too wonderful for me yay for
[51:11] which I know
[51:14] not the way of an eagle in the air yes
[51:17] that's us when we're flying under the
[51:20] anointing the way of a serpent on a rock
[51:23] I'm not sure about how to type that one
[51:25] the way of a ship in the midst of the
[51:26] Sea and the way of a man with the
[51:31] maid you said this is too wonderful to
[51:34] me how can even explain this when a
[51:36] man's in
[51:39] love this is so be this is Holy
[51:41] Scripture right yeah is this the Bible
[51:44] or not this the Bible this the Bible
[51:46] holy script he picks up by the
[51:48] inspiration of the Holy Spirit say these
[51:49] are all beautiful things an eagle
[51:51] soaring a ship sailing so smoothly and
[51:54] then also a man
[51:56] who loves a maid I love to watch in
[51:59] other words it said I love to watch a
[52:01] man who's in love and the lanks he'll go
[52:04] to win that woman's
[52:07] heart feel like Romeo and Juliet or
[52:09] something like that I never even read
[52:12] the book but it's so famous because
[52:14] everybody knows he's a he's Romeo he's a
[52:16] romantic he he was deeply in love and
[52:19] the Bible said this is is too wonderful
[52:21] to even see when a man's in love with a
[52:23] woman and so the write songs on it for
[52:26] the last you know how many thousands of
[52:27] years have people make quite a living
[52:29] singing about love whether it's defeated
[52:31] love or Miss love or actually getting
[52:33] love and that's all lustful love they
[52:36] can make millions and billions of
[52:37] dollars thinking about love what does
[52:39] brother Ram say everybody wants in the
[52:40] whole world what do they want love
[52:43] what's the greatest love there is the
[52:44] love of God that's all perverted love
[52:48] but the love of God ought to be the
[52:49] greatest uh the greatest drawing card of
[52:52] anything amen glory
[52:56] so the writer of the proverb here says
[53:00] it's it's just too wonderful to see a
[53:04] man what is he trying to he's trying to
[53:06] win her
[53:07] heart he's trying to fight for her heart
[53:10] he fights so much he'll forget about his
[53:13] mom that's what I did I stopped hanging
[53:15] out with my mom I met that lady back
[53:18] there Mrs Smith She's mine I didn't hang
[53:22] out with my friends much
[53:24] anymore and didn't hang out with my Bros
[53:26] you know anymore because I had one Focus
[53:29] that was to win her heart that's true
[53:33] and that could be a wonderful thing the
[53:34] Bible said it's a wonderful
[53:36] thing and so this is the type though of
[53:40] Christ and the
[53:42] church right Ephesians 5 tells us that
[53:44] we all know that we it's all read at
[53:45] almost every wedding at least if it's a
[53:47] Christian wedding so Christ a wonderful
[53:49] thing it must be see to see how Christ
[53:52] would love his wife isn't it beautiful
[53:56] How He Loves Us Church we're unworthy
[53:59] but he still Woos us he's like like
[54:01] brother said this morning I was going to
[54:02] preach on that too about about God
[54:04] coming to Adam and say where are you
[54:05] Adam don't hide from me I'm your Lord I
[54:09] love you if you made a mistake just come
[54:11] to me don't run from me come to me
[54:14] Hallelujah this is a type of Christ and
[54:17] the
[54:18] church and I thought this draws a a good
[54:21] picture
[54:22] here let's go toh Proverbs 5 18 since
[54:25] we're in Proverbs this is
[54:28] a this is a great scripture
[54:34] too remember there's all types Christ in
[54:37] the church remember I read you that
[54:39] quote last Sunday where the man said
[54:40] brother brandom she wants me to walk in
[54:42] here we got kids and she wants me to
[54:44] walk in here and act like we just got
[54:46] married and this we can't do this and
[54:48] brother BR said whoop boy look up whoop
[54:50] boy whoop w h o p whoop boy
[54:56] look up W boy he said you need to treat
[54:59] her like that he said she needs that
[55:02] she's 40 years old she needs your
[55:04] attention now more than ever brother
[55:06] Brandon
[55:07] said so not less as you get older more
[55:10] as you get older I know it's hard with
[55:12] kids I gotta I gotta but we got we gotta
[55:14] find the balce church you gotta find the
[55:16] balance gotta find the balance Satan
[55:18] wants us to have no time to love in the
[55:20] home and if he destroys the home he
[55:22] destroyed a
[55:24] lot you got to have the home the home's
[55:27] got to be solid the home's got to be
[55:28] your sanctuary as I was thinking
[55:30] throughout the week I was thinking a lot
[55:32] about this message uh and about marriage
[55:34] and family the home should be like a
[55:36] sanctuary it's like a father goes out in
[55:38] the morning and some mornings I feel
[55:39] like I'm going out and lay to see a like
[55:41] I'm gonna fight you know I'm sneaking
[55:42] out say honey pray for me I'm going back
[55:44] out in L to see it here and there's a
[55:46] huge Battlefield out here I love you
[55:48] pray for me we try to make it home alive
[55:51] because it's such a war right and some
[55:54] some days some days I come like this I
[55:56] feel like I oh I slam the door and I
[55:57] fall against the good door like oh mercy
[55:59] I made it
[56:00] home because I've been fighting and
[56:02] battling all day anybody ever feel like
[56:04] that yeah absolutely I do Satan trying
[56:08] to steal my virtue Satan trying to T me
[56:10] Satan trying to make me struggle and
[56:12] make me doubt all these things I finally
[56:13] get a home and this home should be My
[56:16] Sanctuary it should be where love
[56:19] abides I should be able to come in hug
[56:22] my wife kiss my wife hug the kids sit
[56:25] down read them a book my little ones
[56:26] like to read me or like when I read
[56:28] books to them so I normally read a lot
[56:29] of books and try not to fall asleep
[56:31] while reading those books because I've
[56:33] read some of them many many times but
[56:36] the point is we should get we should
[56:38] come home in and be able to experience
[56:40] love if we don't feel it there at work
[56:42] we should have it at the home and we
[56:44] know our wives are doing their best to
[56:45] keep it there but we've got to lay the
[56:48] foundation we've got to prepare and
[56:51] we've got to set we got to set the the
[56:52] standard in the home the men leads the
[56:54] home
[56:55] now Proverbs
[56:56] 5:15 this speaking of a man and a wife
[57:00] here and uh It Go goes a little bit into
[57:02] adultery but let's look at this here uh
[57:05] 5:15 drink Waters out of thine own syst
[57:09] and running Waters out of thine own well
[57:11] notice thine own your own sistern your
[57:13] own well let thy fountains be dispersed
[57:16] abroad and rivers of waters in the
[57:19] streets let them be only thine own and
[57:23] not strangers with thee so you should
[57:26] have fountains and Wells of water all
[57:28] over your property and they're only
[57:31] yours praise God just
[57:33] yours Verse 18 look at Verse 18 let thy
[57:37] Fountain be bless and rejoice with the
[57:40] wife of thy
[57:41] youth let her be as the loving Hind and
[57:44] pleasant robe let her breath satisfy
[57:46] thee at all times and be thou ravish
[57:48] that means intoxicated always with her
[57:52] love and why wilt thou th son be
[57:55] ravished with a strange woman and
[57:57] embrace the bosom of a stranger why
[57:59] would you do that when you got water of
[58:02] your own you got Wells of your own why
[58:04] would you go drink from another well
[58:05] when you got your own
[58:07] Wells see that verse 21 for the ways of
[58:11] man are before the eyes of the Lord and
[58:13] He Ponder all his goings his own
[58:15] iniquity shall take the wicked himself
[58:17] and he shall be Holden with the cords of
[58:18] his sins look at that see the cords see
[58:20] the chain see the slavery to sin see
[58:23] that he shall die without instruction
[58:25] and in the greatness of his folly he
[58:28] shall go astray so adultery is like a
[58:32] Gateway uh for falling away from God can
[58:34] you say Amen to that because it's a
[58:36] natural and a spiritual thing too
[58:38] there's natural adultery and spiritual
[58:40] adultery but here the Proverbs writer
[58:42] says natural adultery is a gateway or
[58:45] chain here to finally leave away from
[58:48] instruction why because they're they're
[58:50] drunken with the wrong kind of love
[58:52] they're drunken with the love of lust
[58:54] instead of the love of Holiness and
[58:57] Purity hope everybody can see that there
[58:59] by God's grace he's supposed to be uh
[59:02] keeping his vows loving the wife loving
[59:04] the the well that God gave him you
[59:07] already got a well you already got water
[59:09] and the Bible said let uh like that let
[59:11] the fountains be dispersed abroad so
[59:14] everywhere you should have a you should
[59:15] have the feeling for your wife
[59:16] everywhere you should have this love for
[59:17] your wife and family it should be all
[59:19] over your land it should be all over
[59:20] your life you should always love your
[59:23] family shouldn't just be in location
[59:25] your land should be covered and your
[59:27] fountains and Waters your love for your
[59:29] wife and family and children should just
[59:30] flow all over your land amen I should
[59:33] love my wife not just in the bedroom
[59:35] Brothers right we should love our wives
[59:37] in the kitchen we should love our wives
[59:39] when we're out in the garage working and
[59:40] say nice things about her we should love
[59:42] our wives everywhere how about that we
[59:44] should love our children go play with
[59:45] them out in the yard we should love them
[59:47] all around wherever we are the love of
[59:50] God should flow through us to our wives
[59:52] and our children the church said amen
[59:54] all right Glory I don't do that too
[59:56] often but I like to do that sometimes
[59:58] it's kind of nice to do
[59:59] that so the holy spirit said there's a
[1:00:03] wonderful thing about a man who's just
[1:00:05] desperately in love trying to win a wife
[1:00:08] and then the holy spirit said be
[1:00:10] intoxicated with your wife's love only
[1:00:14] other words make her the definition of
[1:00:16] beauty can I say like that some brothers
[1:00:19] in the uh I don't even I'll side this
[1:00:23] some brothers in the past have asked me
[1:00:24] about certain things about marriage and
[1:00:25] things like that and uh I don't even
[1:00:27] know if they're from this church I can't
[1:00:29] remember anymore and that's really I
[1:00:30] can't remember I don't know it's been so
[1:00:32] long ago but they were just saying
[1:00:34] things about uh what if you're not
[1:00:36] attracted to your wife in certain ways
[1:00:38] and things like that I said you know I
[1:00:40] said you've got to you got to make your
[1:00:42] wife the definition of beauty let me say
[1:00:45] like this you got to starve your eyes
[1:00:47] from looking at anything else and just
[1:00:48] look at your wife only that way if you
[1:00:51] starve your your eyes that way and don't
[1:00:54] look at any anyone else and don't think
[1:00:55] about that and if you cut off any evil
[1:00:57] thoughts about that then your wife will
[1:00:59] become the most beautiful thing to you
[1:01:01] because see the the world tries to
[1:01:03] inject you know well woman's got to be
[1:01:05] this figure and that and that and that
[1:01:06] and all that nonsense like that and
[1:01:08] that's all perversion and that's just
[1:01:10] All Flesh right and that will rot like
[1:01:13] brother said when Marilyn died how many
[1:01:15] men want her body now done yeah because
[1:01:17] it proves us not about the flesh it's a
[1:01:19] lustful Spirit behind it yeah that right
[1:01:22] Church go dig that body who wants it now
[1:01:25] nobody because the spirit's gone it was
[1:01:28] a lustful Spirit to begin with yeah are
[1:01:31] you with me so see the Christian Man
[1:01:33] learns that he loves the soul of his
[1:01:36] wife praise
[1:01:38] God and as he loves learns to love her
[1:01:40] soul and know that she's a daughter of
[1:01:43] God right she ain't a piece of meat
[1:01:46] she's not lower than a man as far as
[1:01:48] rulership yes she's under the man but as
[1:01:50] far as salvation she's just as much a a
[1:01:52] child of God as any man is amen
[1:01:55] that right that's true and he learns to
[1:01:58] love her for who she is and who God made
[1:01:59] her to be and love her because she's
[1:02:01] God's daughter amen not just his wife
[1:02:04] but God's daughter amen it's exactly
[1:02:07] right but see adultery that's why that's
[1:02:11] why I like the title this book it's uh
[1:02:13] his knes her KN needes building in a
[1:02:14] fair proof marriage and it's true
[1:02:18] uh if you learn to love and fall in love
[1:02:21] with one person and be loyal to love
[1:02:23] them only and make your definition of
[1:02:25] beauty and make and make them uh the one
[1:02:28] you're intoxicated with the one you're
[1:02:29] always thinking about that it makes you
[1:02:32] forget you you starve any anything else
[1:02:34] you starve any Temptations of the Flesh
[1:02:36] and if you starve that then it's easy to
[1:02:37] do let me say like that it is that's
[1:02:41] exactly true amen so water you know
[1:02:45] that's why I wrote down my notes water
[1:02:46] is water so men are you know men are
[1:02:48] often tempted to have you know other
[1:02:51] lovers and things like that all brother
[1:02:53] man said all men are like that he said
[1:02:55] when a man sees a woman half naked he
[1:02:56] said something passes over his whole
[1:02:58] body he said I've been saved for years
[1:03:00] he said and when he sees something like
[1:03:02] that that's why I put the cross in this
[1:03:03] car a man brother said a man is made to
[1:03:07] reproduce science tells us that and when
[1:03:10] he sees uh something of that nature he
[1:03:12] says something passes over him and he's
[1:03:15] got to turn it down by the power of God
[1:03:17] I don't know if sisters feel that or not
[1:03:19] I don't know but Brothers sure do right
[1:03:23] now one I learned good in this book
[1:03:26] every year you lose a little
[1:03:28] testosterone so it makes a little bit
[1:03:31] easier H this as the years go by I
[1:03:34] thought amen glory U but that doesn't
[1:03:37] mean the sin the Temptation won't come
[1:03:39] because I remember before my Grandpa
[1:03:40] died he was still battling some of those
[1:03:42] things and it was a shame to his
[1:03:43] testimony not a blessing it was a shame
[1:03:45] he was seeing little nurses in the
[1:03:47] hospital and saying things he should not
[1:03:48] have said of course his wife would die
[1:03:50] but still that's still
[1:03:51] wrong so see that that's the I'm talking
[1:03:54] about it's a spirit it's a spirit of
[1:03:55] lust it's not really the physical body
[1:03:57] necessarily because water is
[1:03:59] water Bible said your wife's like a
[1:04:01] fountain well any other woman's like a
[1:04:03] fountain but it's the fountain that God
[1:04:05] gave you amen what what which one did
[1:04:08] God give you that's the one that's best
[1:04:09] for you amen hallelujah that's one you
[1:04:12] must stick with but if not if you get
[1:04:13] looking at other people's fountains the
[1:04:15] Bible said here you're close to having
[1:04:17] no instruction and then the Bible says
[1:04:19] later the adulterer her the woman
[1:04:21] herself whatever more her gates are the
[1:04:23] gates
[1:04:24] hell that true her gates are the gates
[1:04:28] to hell that's what we're trying to keep
[1:04:30] everybody out of spiritual adultery and
[1:04:32] natural
[1:04:33] adultery brother but because Jesus said
[1:04:35] if you think it right here you're
[1:04:37] already guil you already committed
[1:04:39] it see the importance of quick prayer
[1:04:41] Lord forgive me that thought God I don't
[1:04:43] want to think that Lord Jesus purify my
[1:04:45] heart and mind yeah the power of just
[1:04:47] constant repentance wherever whever God
[1:04:50] battles or whever we have a battle God
[1:04:52] will help us to overcome we got to be
[1:04:54] willing to pray like I said this morning
[1:04:56] pray confess come clean before God are
[1:04:58] you enjoying the message so far okay
[1:05:01] praise God Amen so what what we see from
[1:05:03] this is that it's so beautiful to see a
[1:05:05] man in love because he's enjoying the
[1:05:08] chase how many men men like to race
[1:05:10] right men like to chase men like to
[1:05:12] fight men like to uh they they like to
[1:05:15] be they like to be better than somebody
[1:05:18] I love sports because I like to be
[1:05:19] better than other people you I play
[1:05:21] video games I could beat the records and
[1:05:23] that's a man is built to want to conquer
[1:05:25] he's built to fight we listen to this
[1:05:27] one good uh audio series uh Lamplighter
[1:05:31] Theater and my favorite one is Sir
[1:05:32] Knight of the splendid way he talks
[1:05:33] about this Knight and is it's like an
[1:05:36] allegory of a Christian Life he's a
[1:05:37] knight and he has to fight all these and
[1:05:39] he's always fighting himself he has to
[1:05:40] fight the black knight which is himself
[1:05:43] and I thought that's good brother BR
[1:05:44] said my greatest enemy is brother
[1:05:45] Brandon and anyways at the beginning of
[1:05:49] it there's this little uh little scene
[1:05:52] and uh the owner of the shop talks about
[1:05:55] how why do so many boys get involved in
[1:05:58] video games why it's mostly boys why and
[1:06:01] they're mostly fighting games and why do
[1:06:03] they do that because men and boys are
[1:06:06] programmed to want to conquer and fight
[1:06:08] and
[1:06:09] overcome and that's how I was I always
[1:06:11] wanted to play the games and fight and
[1:06:13] win and all these things like that and
[1:06:15] but video games is a is a
[1:06:18] fantasy so is an affair Affairs
[1:06:22] fantasy yeah it's not a real
[1:06:24] relationship it's fantasy that's right
[1:06:27] but so his video games he just made a
[1:06:29] point how that's why these video games
[1:06:31] attract boys and if they play I think
[1:06:33] four hours a day for their life they'll
[1:06:35] waste 16 years of their lives playing
[1:06:37] video games it's probably more than that
[1:06:39] can you imagine if you live 70 years 16
[1:06:42] of that was dedicated just to staring at
[1:06:43] a game and there's no value this game
[1:06:46] doesn't help anybody no one's help it's
[1:06:48] all
[1:06:49] selfish it's all escaping reality like I
[1:06:53] said before I don't want the American
[1:06:54] dream I want the Christian reality
[1:06:57] amen hallelujah amen I want a reality of
[1:07:00] this book of Acts I want a reality of
[1:07:02] Jesus Christ Living in my life amen and
[1:07:04] the spirit of Christ flowing out of me
[1:07:06] with love for God and love for my family
[1:07:09] love for the people of God and making a
[1:07:10] difference in the world even if it's
[1:07:12] just one life we want to make a
[1:07:13] difference amen so see Fighters men are
[1:07:17] Fighters men always went out to war in
[1:07:18] the Bible you never see men and women go
[1:07:20] out every now and then a woman will get
[1:07:21] a victory remember the woman who the
[1:07:23] stone and throw it down in the head the
[1:07:25] Jews are yeah Glory you know every now
[1:07:27] and then you had a girl a woman that
[1:07:28] would play a good part in that you had a
[1:07:30] few women that helped rebuild the wall
[1:07:31] in neiah time I remember preaching on
[1:07:33] that they just helped their fathers and
[1:07:34] took their place and laying the bricks
[1:07:36] and just m right there thank God for
[1:07:38] that but most of the time it's men that
[1:07:40] were Fighters and so brothers that's
[1:07:42] what we're supposed to fight for we're
[1:07:44] supposed to fight for the Holy Ghost
[1:07:47] love to flow through us and that we love
[1:07:49] our wives and love our children that
[1:07:53] origin chase that we had were chasing
[1:07:55] our wives and I talked to one of my
[1:07:57] cousins it was it was s funny but sad uh
[1:08:01] he he's been gting a lot of weight you
[1:08:02] know after marriage and I said you know
[1:08:04] you why you ever think about working out
[1:08:06] because he said oh you're looking real
[1:08:07] nice and trim Jesse and I said well I
[1:08:09] like to work out a little bit you know
[1:08:10] we do a little exercise he's like yeah
[1:08:12] once I got married I gave up because I I
[1:08:14] caught my wife he said I'm just letting
[1:08:16] myself go like he's laughing and making
[1:08:18] a joke about it like just being totally
[1:08:20] honest I laugh but it was like a sad
[1:08:22] laugh like oh man
[1:08:24] you know but that's how a lot of men
[1:08:26] look at like it's just like a like love
[1:08:29] is just a short it's like a shortterm
[1:08:32] part of their life but the real
[1:08:34] Christian is supposed to keep that going
[1:08:37] like brother said you always have a
[1:08:39] honeymoon praise God you to keep that
[1:08:42] going so see it's the the men need to
[1:08:45] realize and I like I said I'm growing in
[1:08:47] this too we want to all grow in this
[1:08:49] what we must fight for love in our
[1:08:51] families real Christian love
[1:08:54] and uh we we got a we got a good enemy
[1:08:56] and it's not some video game Enemy it's
[1:08:58] the devil praise God we got a strong
[1:09:01] enemy brother R said you're no match for
[1:09:02] him unless the Holy Ghost is in your
[1:09:04] life praise God you're no match for the
[1:09:06] devil unless the Holy Ghost is blown
[1:09:08] through your life amen thank God for
[1:09:13] that so think of Jesus the Bible said
[1:09:18] the joy that was set before him what was
[1:09:20] the joy the love of his lady right he's
[1:09:23] going to win the hearts of his children
[1:09:24] amen he's going to purchase their
[1:09:27] salvation and so he goes to Calvary with
[1:09:29] that in mind and we know gets cut and
[1:09:31] blooded and bruised and beaten so he
[1:09:32] don't look like a man he did that for
[1:09:34] the love of his of his wife his beloved
[1:09:37] wife that's right the future love his
[1:09:40] wife because brother Ram said the mar
[1:09:42] the wedding is still future brother
[1:09:43] Ramson he said we got an engagement ring
[1:09:46] right now but the wedding will be at the
[1:09:47] marage supper the lamb amen he's still
[1:09:50] looking forward to that hallelujah amen
[1:09:55] even though his Jewish people rejected
[1:09:56] him he said I'll do it to redeem some of
[1:09:58] those but I'll do it for the Gentile
[1:10:00] bride as well amen all
[1:10:04] right let's look at this here now I want
[1:10:07] to read this too Malachi 2:14 to 16
[1:10:10] let's read that Malachi 214-
[1:10:14] 16 I love that little uh ever since I've
[1:10:17] seen this little sign that gets hung in
[1:10:19] my
[1:10:20] house I have just loved it I forget
[1:10:22] whose house I first saw it at maybe
[1:10:23] brother Brooks's I don't remember whose
[1:10:25] house when I first came in the
[1:10:27] message but it says something along this
[1:10:29] lines like Christ is the the the silent
[1:10:32] guest at every meal and he's a silent
[1:10:34] listener at every conversation I I just
[1:10:38] first time I saw that I thought Mercy I
[1:10:39] love that that I'm so humbled like I
[1:10:42] just wanna I want to live my life like
[1:10:44] he's there every every single
[1:10:46] moment and uh and think about that as we
[1:10:49] read this because that's true that is
[1:10:52] very true Christ is in every
[1:10:53] conversation he's either grieved by the
[1:10:56] conversation or he's blessed by
[1:10:58] it he's either grieved how we treat one
[1:11:01] another or he's blessed by it and we
[1:11:04] don't want to grieve him we want to
[1:11:05] bless him okay Malachi
[1:11:12] 2:14 yet ye say wherefore because the
[1:11:15] Lord have been witness between thee and
[1:11:17] the wife of thy youth against whom thou
[1:11:20] Hast dealt
[1:11:21] treacherously so these you know Malachi
[1:11:24] speaking to uh the men of
[1:11:26] Israel this is around the time of
[1:11:29] Nehemiah this is about 397 BC so right
[1:11:33] after the wall was built okay so they
[1:11:35] had not been treating their wives well
[1:11:37] whole generation of Jewish men not
[1:11:39] treating their lives or wives well
[1:11:42] rather okay yet is she thy companion and
[1:11:45] the wife of thy Covenant so even though
[1:11:49] she's your your companion Covenant she's
[1:11:51] with you all the time you're dealing Tre
[1:11:53] ously you're not treating her
[1:11:55] fairly sounds like God wants his
[1:11:57] daughters to be treated the right
[1:11:58] treated the right way how many say Amen
[1:11:59] to
[1:12:00] that because God Is Watching God is a
[1:12:04] witness and did he not did not he make
[1:12:09] one yet had he the residue of the spirit
[1:12:12] and wherefore one that he might seek a
[1:12:15] Godly seed therefore take heed to your
[1:12:17] spirit see why do men mistreat their
[1:12:19] wives they got a wrong Spirit on them
[1:12:22] right take heed to your not Soul not
[1:12:25] flesh take heed to your spirit the mind
[1:12:28] is Anointed The motiv the attitude
[1:12:30] whatever more it's Anointed with the
[1:12:31] wrong Spirit that's
[1:12:36] right and let none deal treacherously
[1:12:39] against the wife of his youth well
[1:12:41] sometimes you can deal treacherously
[1:12:43] with your wi is that what God Said No
[1:12:46] never let none of them do that right
[1:12:48] Brothers right I only have a few
[1:12:50] Brothers here tonight so sorry Brothers
[1:12:52] You're the only ones I can look at you
[1:12:53] know I can't look at anybody else I
[1:12:55] could pretend there's Brothers you know
[1:12:59] I guess I can just look you know think
[1:13:00] about looking at myself in the mirror I
[1:13:01] know I gotta do a better job but this is
[1:13:03] a reality don't let anybody
[1:13:06] treacherously treat your wife always
[1:13:08] treat her fairly always treat with Godly
[1:13:11] love because God is watching
[1:13:15] you that's the word of the
[1:13:18] Lord so we must deal with our wives
[1:13:21] justly she must be treated Fair she's
[1:13:24] your companion uh part of the Covenant
[1:13:26] with you and God is watching let's read
[1:13:29] verse 162 for the Lord the god of Israel
[1:13:32] sayith that he hateth putting away God
[1:13:33] hates divorc listen people can be
[1:13:36] divorced and not be divorced you know
[1:13:37] what I'm saying they can be of two
[1:13:39] different spirits and not one spirit and
[1:13:42] yet living in the same house right
[1:13:44] Church coming to the same church yes so
[1:13:48] God help
[1:13:49] us for one cover violence With His
[1:13:52] Garment sayith the Lord of of host
[1:13:54] therefore take heed well look covering
[1:13:56] they just covering like this morning
[1:13:58] hiding things therefore take heed to
[1:14:00] your spirit that you deal not
[1:14:02] treacherously how do you take heed to
[1:14:04] your spirit you think about am I
[1:14:05] thinking the right things are these the
[1:14:06] right
[1:14:08] thoughts I need to examine myself am I
[1:14:11] saying the right thing am I doing the
[1:14:13] right thing do I have the right
[1:14:15] attitude take heed to your spirit take
[1:14:19] heed to your thinking take heed to your
[1:14:21] words because they have a great impact
[1:14:23] upon the wives
[1:14:27] absolutely so God is watching us
[1:14:29] Brothers how we treat our wives and
[1:14:31] don't and uh and don't think the other
[1:14:33] people they didn't come tonight so they
[1:14:34] don't get to hear this preaching I'm
[1:14:35] gonna preach this
[1:14:37] again by God's grace told my wife I said
[1:14:40] The more services we can have about
[1:14:42] marriage and family the better how many
[1:14:43] would say amen amen I I would say Amen
[1:14:46] sure because if sometimes like I told
[1:14:48] you if I forget about it I don't treat
[1:14:49] my wife like I have to I don't treat her
[1:14:51] as good as she deserves I don't treat my
[1:14:53] children as much as well as they deserve
[1:14:54] to be treated I'm just going to be
[1:14:56] honest and say that but I am growing in
[1:14:58] Grace and knowledge of the Lord and I do
[1:15:00] try to repent to them when I make a
[1:15:02] mistake try to face them and say you
[1:15:04] know what that's my fault forgive me I
[1:15:06] didn't mean to do
[1:15:08] that and they'll think more of us if we
[1:15:10] do
[1:15:11] that all right I've had people even tell
[1:15:15] me I've done that at school and I've had
[1:15:16] you know you know um teachers AIDS in
[1:15:18] the classroom and you know even get
[1:15:20] substitute teachers and they see me
[1:15:22] repent to my class
[1:15:24] and then they say they notice that they
[1:15:25] said why did you repent that's that's
[1:15:27] nice that you do that you don't make
[1:15:28] yourself above and like you're the
[1:15:30] absolute or anything like that are you
[1:15:32] the one who has all the
[1:15:33] knowledge and I say well I'm doing it to
[1:15:35] model forgiveness I'm doing it to model
[1:15:38] repentance and in my class that's what
[1:15:40] it is we always have squabbles if
[1:15:42] anyone's ever been in school lately
[1:15:43] there's always squabbles this is the
[1:15:45] time of year really heats up too well
[1:15:47] Jimmy cut me in line and I was here
[1:15:49] first this is my spot all these kind of
[1:15:51] things and so I say you know what
[1:15:53] somebody's got to
[1:15:54] apologize and if you don't apologize
[1:15:56] you're both going down the
[1:15:58] line so in my class you hear you hear me
[1:16:01] say often some you need to say you're
[1:16:02] sorry say you're sorry what do you say I
[1:16:04] always make them repent and say they're
[1:16:06] sorry sorry for what what do you mean
[1:16:07] what sorry for talking during the end of
[1:16:10] the day Mr Smith I'm sorry for talking
[1:16:12] I'm sorry for uh you know accidentally
[1:16:14] knocking her over knocking her chair
[1:16:15] over I need to I'm trying to teach them
[1:16:18] how to repent yeah because listen I
[1:16:20] wasn't raised to know how to repent no
[1:16:22] one taught me
[1:16:24] we would just laugh at sin and we we
[1:16:27] there's no there's no repercussion
[1:16:29] really to it now when I I got older my
[1:16:30] mom started putting soap down my mouth
[1:16:31] for saying bad words she would like take
[1:16:34] take that liquid dish soap and she would
[1:16:35] wrestle me down that was before I got
[1:16:37] stronger you know but she wrestled me
[1:16:38] down and she was sticking in my mouth
[1:16:40] and you know but there's really no like
[1:16:43] I'm sorry I'm truly sorry so we're
[1:16:45] trying to form that into them so they
[1:16:48] learn how to apologize because some
[1:16:50] people are just like I was I was never
[1:16:51] taught to apologize my my wife had to
[1:16:53] help me learn how to apologize does that
[1:16:55] sound funny or what she had to help me
[1:16:57] learn how to apologize because I never
[1:16:59] knew how I would say I'm sorry but
[1:17:01] because of this and this and this and
[1:17:03] that's not a real
[1:17:04] apology that's making excuses yeah the
[1:17:07] real apology is I'm sorry it's my fault
[1:17:10] end of
[1:17:11] story I'll do better next
[1:17:14] time and the church say it's not making
[1:17:17] an excuse why you did it it's just
[1:17:19] saying you're sorry you're wrong and God
[1:17:21] helped me out to do it again
[1:17:23] how come when when we read Psalms 51 and
[1:17:26] David's apologizing or repenting about
[1:17:28] bash Sheba how come he never says Lord
[1:17:29] I'm sorry but it's all her fault because
[1:17:31] she was dressing in modestly and she was
[1:17:33] bathing herself that's called pushing
[1:17:35] the
[1:17:36] buck that's called passing the buck on
[1:17:39] somebody right like I had one of my uh
[1:17:43] instructors lately he said why he said
[1:17:45] I'm so upset today because of my
[1:17:47] children my children made me upset I
[1:17:48] think no you don't have to that's your
[1:17:49] choice to be
[1:17:51] upset we are supposed to have power to
[1:17:53] overcome those things that's what Satan
[1:17:56] wants to make us think that we have a
[1:17:58] right to be out with the wrong spirit
[1:18:00] because someone did it to us well no
[1:18:02] we're supposed to actually cast down
[1:18:03] that wrong spirit and we're supposed to
[1:18:05] keep the right
[1:18:07] spirit
[1:18:08] amen and as soon as he said that I
[1:18:10] thought nope that's wrong you no one can
[1:18:14] make you be that way you have to choose
[1:18:16] you have to submit to that
[1:18:19] Spirit that's exactly right and look
[1:18:21] what God Said God said I'm watching you
[1:18:23] husbands all our husbands here God's
[1:18:26] watching how do we treat our wives and
[1:18:28] we'll answer for it I want to be able to
[1:18:30] answer and say Lord I did mistreat your
[1:18:31] daughter a few times I asked her to
[1:18:33] forgive me I repented of it and you
[1:18:35] helped me you know to to get better I
[1:18:37] believe your promises you help me to be
[1:18:38] a better husband as I got older because
[1:18:40] I read more books about the Bible uh
[1:18:42] about how to love my wife and I I prayed
[1:18:44] more I heard more sermons about how to
[1:18:45] be a better husband that's what I don't
[1:18:46] tell the
[1:18:48] Lord amen that's what I want to tell the
[1:18:50] Lord I devoted myself myself I focused
[1:18:54] myself to how to be a better father and
[1:18:56] a better husband I applied myself to
[1:18:59] that okay how am I doing on time okay
[1:19:01] all right it's almost 5:30 okay I
[1:19:03] started at what probably 4:30 all right
[1:19:04] we'll try to go a little bit further
[1:19:07] here you know men loves check men love
[1:19:09] checklist don't they I do I have about
[1:19:12] five different apps that are like to-do
[1:19:13] apps like checklist checklist apps I
[1:19:15] just love checklists or something about
[1:19:17] it like it feels so good you check it oh
[1:19:19] it's done thank you Lord you know I just
[1:19:21] I love that but God's checklist is
[1:19:23] pretty small he said love your wives as
[1:19:26] you love
[1:19:28] yourselves right and then don't revoke
[1:19:30] your children to be spiritless or
[1:19:32] heartless right so God gives us a really
[1:19:35] short
[1:19:36] checklist love
[1:19:39] love love we've got to love and love
[1:19:45] means
[1:19:47] no love means the focus is off me and
[1:19:50] it's on the other
[1:19:51] people okay okay that's what love means
[1:19:54] so I wrote here men the checklist is
[1:19:56] pretty short love her like you love
[1:19:59] yourself the most men if you're like me
[1:20:02] you just give yourself whatever you need
[1:20:03] like if I need a new pair of pants I
[1:20:05] don't even ask my wife I just go out to
[1:20:06] co and bu this I hate going shopping I
[1:20:09] just would rather just order from home
[1:20:11] but I probably buy the wrong size I just
[1:20:13] whatever I need I just go get it as soon
[1:20:15] as I need it um and I try to get the
[1:20:18] best thing I want to make it last I get
[1:20:20] a nice one right try to get something
[1:20:21] nice well if that's how we treat
[1:20:24] ourselves Brothers then we should treat
[1:20:25] our wives very similar to that right we
[1:20:28] should try to do something nice however
[1:20:30] I would treat myself that's how I want
[1:20:32] to treat my wife I think my wife if I
[1:20:35] think I would want something nice I
[1:20:36] think my wife would want something nice
[1:20:38] too right that's absolutely right so we
[1:20:41] got to do that we gota actually apply
[1:20:43] that because that's what that's what
[1:20:44] Paul said Jesus said we gotta love our
[1:20:47] wives as we love
[1:20:49] ourselves all
[1:20:51] right now let me just get back to this
[1:20:53] real quick about books molding your okay
[1:20:56] now I think I read
[1:20:58] that oh yeah I was just going to say
[1:21:00] this too you know people a lot of men

[1:21:19] all these things like that and they say
[1:21:22] they don't like to read you do like to
[1:21:25] read so see the the reality is we got to
[1:21:30] be able to sacrifice anything we like or
[1:21:33] anything we try to you know let off the
[1:21:35] pressure any hobbies we have and we got
[1:21:37] to devote that to the will of God we've
[1:21:39] got to do that if we're going to love
[1:21:41] our wives and love our children
[1:21:45] absolutely so I want to make sure I read
[1:21:47] that brother BR said the books you read
[1:21:48] whatever you read on your phone whatever
[1:21:50] you read you're reading somewhere
[1:21:51] whatever you read will mold your
[1:21:53] character that's why I stay stay away
[1:21:55] from a lot of the news sites when I read
[1:21:57] the news search I just scroll down for a
[1:21:58] little bit I just read the headlines
[1:21:59] usually I rarely ever read any of the
[1:22:01] Articles because really a lot of that I
[1:22:03] found doesn't even it doesn't even edify
[1:22:05] me like sometimes I read an article if I
[1:22:07] want to see you know how many delegates
[1:22:09] did this person have and you know I was
[1:22:11] just reading a little bit of that or
[1:22:12] there's a certain article I want to
[1:22:13] learn about this or that but a lot of
[1:22:15] that I just kind of go through the
[1:22:17] headlines because it always isn't always
[1:22:20] edifying or beneficial so make sure we
[1:22:23] what we're reading is the right
[1:22:25] thing all right I want to let's see got
[1:22:29] that got
[1:22:31] that got it okay let me read this quote
[1:22:35] to
[1:22:37] you I want to apply this to the man now
[1:22:39] brother Ram applies this to the Holy
[1:22:41] Spirit brother Ram tells about the Ducks
[1:22:43] he said every fall he said that main
[1:22:45] duck will will call all the other Ducks
[1:22:48] right and then they'll go down south he
[1:22:49] said that's God's provided way now
[1:22:51] listen he said now you think you about
[1:22:54] you you think about finding them a
[1:22:55] better way or could you find them a
[1:22:57] better leader than God's provided leader
[1:23:00] for
[1:23:01] them now maybe you could take a old
[1:23:03] Gander out here somewhere and take him
[1:23:05] out and feed him on certain vitamins and
[1:23:07] so forth and give him a special call you
[1:23:09] know s him out there with put a little
[1:23:10] Honker on his mouth that might give him
[1:23:13] a special Melody he could almost yodel
[1:23:15] with that and you might write it up in
[1:23:17] the papers and say a duck that can yodel
[1:23:19] and oh all the Ducks is bound to find
[1:23:20] him he'll know which way to take them
[1:23:22] because he's really cultured and
[1:23:23] educated and he's fixed up he can do it
[1:23:26] he said he might sit out there in Yoda
[1:23:28] all afternoon there would never be a
[1:23:30] duck come around him he said because my
[1:23:33] sheep know my voice and a stranger they
[1:23:36] will not follow
[1:23:38] amen so could you ever find a better
[1:23:41] leader than the lead than the lead duck
[1:23:44] no no matter how much you try to make
[1:23:46] somebody else impersonate it you'll
[1:23:48] never find a better leader can you ever
[1:23:50] find a better leader for the church than
[1:23:51] the Holy Ghost
[1:23:53] never find a better one amen I'll never
[1:23:55] be a leader no man will ever be a leader
[1:23:57] the main leader is the Holy Ghost amen
[1:24:00] but what I'm saying is I'm applying that
[1:24:02] to the home Brothers if we're husbands
[1:24:05] and and fathers then if God give us this
[1:24:08] family then there's no better leader for
[1:24:10] that family than
[1:24:11] us praise God if we are God's chosen
[1:24:15] leader for that family there's no better
[1:24:17] one to lead we just have to make sure we
[1:24:20] lead with love amen
[1:24:23] there's no better leader for my family
[1:24:25] than Jesse Smith Loris Ro for Loris Ro's
[1:24:29] family Andy rer for Andy Raber's family
[1:24:32] brother Johnny for Johnny's family but
[1:24:34] now everybody knows who's here so I
[1:24:38] don't even know like last week we had
[1:24:39] one person live streaming in the evening
[1:24:40] service so it's usually not too bad but
[1:24:42] I'm just joking but you understand
[1:24:45] there's no better leader we just have to
[1:24:47] make sure we're Anointed with the right
[1:24:49] Spirit Glory right spirit because God's
[1:24:52] looking at our spirit what kind of
[1:24:54] spirit is on us are we dealing
[1:24:55] treacherously with our wives and
[1:24:57] children or are we dealing justly with
[1:24:59] them God will make us answer for how we
[1:25:01] do
[1:25:02] it that's
[1:25:04] right and now listen Brothers I want to
[1:25:07] read this to you let's go to Matthew
[1:25:08] 1:24 let's read this in our Bibles
[1:25:10] Matthew
[1:25:12] 1:24 I want you to see what a good
[1:25:14] leader Joseph was uh the husband of uh
[1:25:17] the Virgin
[1:25:18] Mary I just say that Virgin Mary not
[1:25:21] because I'm or anything just because it
[1:25:23] differentiates her from all the other
[1:25:25] mares that's why I'm saying that um
[1:25:28] Matthew
[1:25:30] 1:24 I want you to see what kind of a
[1:25:32] leader he was I think I think if all the
[1:25:34] brothers are honest we'll say God help
[1:25:36] us to be more like him
[1:25:39] yeah now you know the
[1:25:41] story Joseph was gonna put Mary away for
[1:25:44] uh fornication he's gon to do it
[1:25:46] privately not publicly because he was a
[1:25:48] just man he's a Godly Man fair man and
[1:25:51] then what happened he had a
[1:25:54] dream and the angel Gabriel come and
[1:25:57] tell tells him that this conceed of hers
[1:25:59] of the Holy Ghost look at verse 24 as
[1:26:02] soon as he wakes up then Joseph being
[1:26:04] raised from sleep did as the angel Lord
[1:26:07] had bid him and took unto him his wife
[1:26:10] and knew her not till she had brought
[1:26:11] forth her firstborn son and called his
[1:26:14] name Jesus I love that as soon as he got
[1:26:17] the word of the Lord on how to lead his
[1:26:19] wife right he's going to put her away
[1:26:21] but as soon as he got the word Lord he
[1:26:23] acted upon it that's a real man and
[1:26:26] that's church that's what our men need
[1:26:28] to be we need to hear the word of God
[1:26:31] and put it into action in our homes and
[1:26:33] in our lives absolutely that's why I'm
[1:26:35] here to help you if I can help in any
[1:26:37] way if I can help any family I want to
[1:26:39] do it as I said our church isn't one
[1:26:42] that has ask for a lot of counseling
[1:26:44] some Churches have a lot of that some
[1:26:45] Churches don't have much our church
[1:26:47] hardly has any counseling so if anyone
[1:26:49] would like any counseling I'm pretty
[1:26:51] available actually pretty available
[1:26:53] Saturday's a good day Sunday's a good
[1:26:54] day I can meet between Services before
[1:26:56] service after service I have plenty time
[1:26:58] for counseling or I come over over come
[1:27:00] over to my house or whatever more any uh
[1:27:03] help I can give would be a blessing and
[1:27:06] some people say well brother Jess you
[1:27:07] hardly have any gray hairs how could you
[1:27:08] help anybody well they could have said
[1:27:10] the same thing to Paul Paul how can you
[1:27:12] help anybody with marriage you're not
[1:27:13] even married
[1:27:15] yeah God was showing them it's not about
[1:27:17] the experience it's about the gift of
[1:27:18] God in their life yes so me I can help
[1:27:22] you that if you have confidence there's
[1:27:24] a gift in my life anyway to begin with
[1:27:27] if if you don't have any confidence I
[1:27:28] can't help
[1:27:29] you okay as as a
[1:27:32] pastor but that's what we got to look
[1:27:34] Pastor you go you know remember go
[1:27:36] remember Paul told that Timothy that
[1:27:37] young Pastor he said don't let anybody
[1:27:39] despise that you're young you be the
[1:27:42] example and I try to be the example of
[1:27:44] this church I try to get my heart and
[1:27:46] soul to God and everything this church
[1:27:48] is about I try to do right there right
[1:27:50] right there with you praise praise the
[1:27:52] Lord yes sir I spent hours and hours I'm
[1:27:54] not bragging I spent hours and hours
[1:27:55] here painting I spent three hours last
[1:27:57] night working on this stage I do
[1:27:59] whatever I got to do because I know God
[1:28:00] called me to do this so this is for His
[1:28:02] glory so if this looks awful you forgive
[1:28:04] me I'm not a
[1:28:07] handyman but whatever what I'm saying is
[1:28:09] that I want to do what God's called me
[1:28:10] to do and I want to do it with all my
[1:28:12] heart I want when I see the word of God
[1:28:14] I want to put it into action in my in my
[1:28:16] family that's what look that's what
[1:28:18] Joseph did he heard the word immediately
[1:28:20] he rose up and he took Mary his wife
[1:28:22] life look at the next chapter chapter 2
[1:28:24] verse
[1:28:26] 14 now he has another dream where the
[1:28:29] angel tells him go to
[1:28:31] Egypt but does he wait upon a little
[1:28:33] while the Lord and say well Lord I'll
[1:28:35] see if I have two or three Witnesses on
[1:28:37] that he do he doesn't wait for two or
[1:28:39] three
[1:28:40] Witnesses he knows when it's God and he
[1:28:44] knows when it's right he acts on it
[1:28:45] that's a real
[1:28:46] leader look what he does next and when
[1:28:49] when he arose he took the young child
[1:28:51] and his mother by what morning by
[1:28:55] night and departed into Egypt he didn't
[1:28:58] even wait to get more sleep church this
[1:29:01] is how much he respected God's word and
[1:29:03] then if we could get this Brothers we
[1:29:05] can get this God will help transform our
[1:29:07] homes even
[1:29:09] more hear the word and act upon it like
[1:29:13] I said last week if you don't have a
[1:29:14] Bible time with your family Brothers you
[1:29:16] make a Bible time either in the morning
[1:29:17] or the night make you you need to teach
[1:29:19] your children the word of God just read
[1:29:21] it them just let them hear the word of
[1:29:24] God you've got to do that you're the
[1:29:25] priest of the home brother brand said we
[1:29:28] got to you have to make time for that
[1:29:30] it's not easy I could be doing study or
[1:29:31] things like that but I realize I'm the
[1:29:33] one who's supposed to teach that so I
[1:29:36] gotta gather around I gotta rally all
[1:29:38] six around and get my uh my Smith gang
[1:29:40] rallied around you know and reading the
[1:29:42] word of God if I don't do it no one else
[1:29:45] is gonna do it it's my job like I told
[1:29:49] you when I was growing up that's what my
[1:29:50] mom would do she was uh you know my Mom
[1:29:52] and Dad divorced when I was I think in
[1:29:53] seventh grade but every night church God
[1:29:56] knows my mom would make all of us five
[1:29:58] boys and one girl all gathered in her
[1:30:01] room and we'd have to pray all all out
[1:30:03] loud every night every night and
[1:30:06] sometimes it was silly sometimes we'd be
[1:30:07] fussing and fighting would she make us
[1:30:09] stay there and pray every night and she
[1:30:12] joined our hands before we went up to
[1:30:13] high school before we went to school
[1:30:15] she'd make us stand in the circle and
[1:30:16] bow our heads and pray before went to
[1:30:18] school every single day
[1:30:22] my mom you know she cuts her hair this
[1:30:24] short paints her face all these things
[1:30:26] like that but she knows that God honors
[1:30:29] prayer yeah she don't know a whole lot
[1:30:31] about the Deep things but she knows God
[1:30:33] honors
[1:30:34] prayer and that's why I say I feel like
[1:30:36] I'm a I'm a fruit to all her prayers I
[1:30:39] trust I hope I am by God's grace and my
[1:30:41] pray prayers of my grandparents but look
[1:30:44] this is this that's what the brothers
[1:30:45] have to do the brothers have to teach
[1:30:46] their children and love their children
[1:30:49] and really make this home a real
[1:30:50] Sanctuary to God I'm going a little bit
[1:30:52] longer maybe uh let me set my Tim here
[1:30:54] about let's go about 10 more minutes and
[1:30:55] we'll try to find a place
[1:30:58] close about 10 more minutes by the grace
[1:31:00] of the Lord I know these are real
[1:31:01] personal things but they're real great
[1:31:03] things too we surely need them I know I
[1:31:06] need them I know I was reading this book
[1:31:08] this week I read two chapters on Monday
[1:31:11] and read one more chapter each of the
[1:31:13] rest of the days I felt so I was like
[1:31:15] wow I forgot a lot of these things I can
[1:31:17] do a lot of more things for my wife so I
[1:31:19] was thinking about her throughout the
[1:31:20] day I bought her some flowers you know
[1:31:22] just I try to when I come home I try to
[1:31:23] hug her more and scratch her back and I
[1:31:26] rubbed her feet last night you know just
[1:31:29] trying to be a good husband you know uh
[1:31:31] trying to show her that I love
[1:31:33] her so that's what I'm saying like when
[1:31:35] we when we talk about marriage it gets
[1:31:37] our hearts pointed toward home right
[1:31:39] like that old radio program turning your
[1:31:41] hearts toward home you know that that's
[1:31:43] I think that's a good thing to do have
[1:31:44] our hearts toward home yeah because if
[1:31:47] our children are going to see Christ you
[1:31:48] know where they're going to see it
[1:31:48] they're going to see in our home that's
[1:31:50] where we want them to see it what to see
[1:31:52] Christ in
[1:31:53] us okay all right so yeah he arose
[1:31:56] immediately that night and departed into
[1:31:57] Egypt that's Joseph Joseph what a good
[1:32:00] example he
[1:32:01] was all right now I know I had a quote
[1:32:03] on that here just bear with me I got my
[1:32:06] timer
[1:32:10] going I just want to make sure I read
[1:32:12] that by God's grace maybe it's not on
[1:32:14] this
[1:32:17] one okay must not be on that one but
[1:32:20] brother b i to get to that sorry about
[1:32:27] that help me Jesus anyways so there's no
[1:32:31] better leader for your family Brothers
[1:32:33] than you your God's provided leader for
[1:32:36] your wife and your children think of
[1:32:38] Abraham Abraham was God's provided
[1:32:40] leader for
[1:32:41] Sarah no one else could have led her to
[1:32:44] have a child only Abraham because he's
[1:32:46] the only one that had faith for it right
[1:32:48] right he was a perfect choice for Sarah
[1:32:51] so after following her or after she
[1:32:53] found him for 25 years she inherited the
[1:32:55] promise amen there's a few bumps in the
[1:32:58] road there there's a few stumbles and
[1:33:01] lying in a little bit of
[1:33:03] deception there's an ishmail there's a
[1:33:05] Hagar a lot of few bumps in the road but
[1:33:08] if they just stayed true to the faith if
[1:33:11] she just stayed true and humbled herself
[1:33:12] and followed that man God's provided
[1:33:14] leader she received her promise
[1:33:17] Glory think of Joshua the great prophet
[1:33:21] Moses went out to seene oh our great
[1:33:23] love our beloved leader he's the one
[1:33:24] that brought us out of Egypt we love him
[1:33:27] oh my the tables of stone and all these
[1:33:30] things what they do they decide well if
[1:33:32] God took him off the scene God must be
[1:33:34] raising up another leader and so God
[1:33:36] raised up a Joshua and the people
[1:33:39] followed him and they followed him so
[1:33:41] far they got circumcised Glory they
[1:33:43] crossed over Jordan and they went in the
[1:33:45] promised land and Jo Joshua told him
[1:33:47] this is your land that's your land go
[1:33:49] fight for that land he positionally repl
[1:33:52] them because he was the Right leader for
[1:33:53] them amen God help us to be position
[1:33:56] replaced by the holy spirit amen that
[1:33:59] the leader the holy spirit will lead us
[1:34:01] Brothers to place our children in
[1:34:03] certain the right channels the right
[1:34:04] activities how many would say Amen to
[1:34:06] that God lead me to place my children in
[1:34:08] the right positions my wife in the right
[1:34:10] position get everybody placed right in
[1:34:12] the right place in our family then we
[1:34:13] got a real moving Army for God
[1:34:19] Amen look at this one here uh lot lot
[1:34:22] was not so much of a good leader lot did
[1:34:26] pretty good at the beginning lot was
[1:34:28] following Abraham although Abraham was
[1:34:29] not supposed to have follow him he was
[1:34:31] doing better followed Abraham than he
[1:34:32] was the other way and then he took the
[1:34:35] wrong choice he looked at Sodom and said
[1:34:37] M I need to go after Sodom and riches
[1:34:39] and I'm going to devote my life to that
[1:34:40] I'm gonna spend my time close to riches
[1:34:42] and all these homosexuals and everything
[1:34:44] like that and what happened we don't
[1:34:45] even know if his wife or daughters were
[1:34:47] saved probably lost because Jesus said
[1:34:49] remember them and don't act like them
[1:34:51] but we know lot was saved yeah so see
[1:34:54] what his leadership did his leadership
[1:34:56] took them closer to worldliness yeah
[1:35:00] he's a good man he's a saved man right
[1:35:02] brother he's saved L was saved he's
[1:35:05] righteous but his leadership got off he
[1:35:08] led them the wrong
[1:35:12] direction and he didn't really care as
[1:35:14] much about his children did he because
[1:35:15] he told those men those homosexual men
[1:35:17] he said you want my two daughters take
[1:35:19] my two daughters not these two men what
[1:35:21] kind of father would do
[1:35:23] that you don't even care about this
[1:35:25] daughter's purity and everything like
[1:35:27] that what kind of a filthy I should say
[1:35:28] filthy would say but what kind of a
[1:35:30] thinking must have been in his mind
[1:35:32] think about that look at his
[1:35:36] leadership he was the Right leader but
[1:35:38] he made the right wrong decisions I'll
[1:35:40] say like that I already showed Joseph
[1:35:43] with Mary and
[1:35:44] Jesus how many uh how many like reading
[1:35:49] Ezra let's go to Ezra chapter 8 this is
[1:35:50] beautiful
[1:35:59] now let's go to Ezra 8 verse one now
[1:36:03] this is a beautiful story this is when
[1:36:04] Ezra is bringing out these Jews out of
[1:36:08] Babylon and God's trying to God Inspire
[1:36:10] them go back and rebuild the Temple go
[1:36:12] back to Jerusalem and they get to the
[1:36:14] spot where Ezra's getting nervous he's
[1:36:16] like yeah he asked the king well can we
[1:36:18] have like an escort to protect us across
[1:36:20] the desert and all these robbers out the
[1:36:22] desert all these things like that and he
[1:36:24] got all scared look at verse 81 these
[1:36:27] are now the chief of their fathers and
[1:36:29] this is the genealogy of them that went
[1:36:30] up with me from Babylon in the reign of
[1:36:32] arz Xerxes the king now go down to verse
[1:36:35] 15 I gather them together to the river
[1:36:38] that run to Aha and there Abode we in
[1:36:41] tents three days and I viewed the people
[1:36:43] and the priests and found their none of
[1:36:45] the sons of Levi now go down to verse
[1:36:48] 21 so he sees we're all gathered here
[1:36:50] we're just trying to leave Babylon verse
[1:36:53] 21 then I proclaimed a fast there at the
[1:36:55] river of aava I think it's aava that we
[1:36:57] might afflict ourselves before our God
[1:36:59] to seek of him a right way for us and
[1:37:04] for our little ones and for all our
[1:37:07] substance praise God what is he trying
[1:37:10] to do he's trying to make an exodus out
[1:37:12] of
[1:37:13] Babylon Glory we're trying to make an
[1:37:15] exus out of the things of the world is
[1:37:17] that right but he doesn't know the way
[1:37:20] how's this going to happen and what does
[1:37:22] the man do what's the real leader do he
[1:37:24] said let's fast and pray glory in other
[1:37:27] words let's seek God I don't know how
[1:37:29] our little ones I don't know how my
[1:37:31] children and family are going to make it
[1:37:33] out of here alive amen I don't know how
[1:37:35] they're going to make it out of there
[1:37:36] see alive but if I fast and pray and
[1:37:38] seek God don't you think God will answer
[1:37:40] my prayer praise God I'm the priest of
[1:37:42] the home I gotta pray I got to seek God
[1:37:44] and that's what our brothers must do
[1:37:45] they must seek God for the leadership of
[1:37:48] their little ones for their wives
[1:37:50] they've got to seek God's face with
[1:37:51] prayer
[1:37:53] heyen verse 22 for I was ashamed to
[1:37:56] inquire of the king a band of soldiers
[1:37:58] and Horsemen to help us against the
[1:38:00] enemy in the way because we had spoken
[1:38:01] un the king saying the hand of our God
[1:38:03] is upon all them for good that seek him
[1:38:06] but his power his wrath is against all
[1:38:08] them that forsake him so he fasted and
[1:38:09] besought our God for this and he was
[1:38:11] intreated of us amen so when they fasted
[1:38:14] and prayed God heard them now Ezra was
[1:38:18] going to go ask him for help but he was
[1:38:20] ashamed because his testimony was all
[1:38:22] full of Faith he said if if we're doing
[1:38:24] right God will be with us God will
[1:38:25] protect us but they started fearing what
[1:38:27] do I do what do I
[1:38:29] do and he said well fast and pray and
[1:38:31] then when they fasted and prayed God
[1:38:33] heard them from Heaven
[1:38:36] amen look at verse
[1:38:39] 31 then we departed from the river of
[1:38:41] Hava on the 12th day of the first month
[1:38:43] to go into Jerusalem and the Hand of our
[1:38:44] God was upon us and he delivered us from
[1:38:47] the hand of the enemy and of such as lie
[1:38:49] in wait by the way don't you love that
[1:38:53] men the men of the homes decided we're
[1:38:56] going to fast and pray to know how to
[1:38:59] lead our little ones and our and our
[1:39:00] wives and when they did God delivered
[1:39:03] them because the leaders the men fasted
[1:39:06] and prayed about how to seek God how
[1:39:07] many brothers like that
[1:39:11] amen and I told us to the church before
[1:39:13] I know where my calling is I prayed and
[1:39:15] fasted and God showed me I'm to be
[1:39:17] Pastor I thought about going back to
[1:39:18] evangelism a few years ago God showed me
[1:39:20] I put a fleece before Lord and showed me
[1:39:22] I'm supposed to Pastor so I'm not
[1:39:23] worried about my direction anymore I
[1:39:25] fasted and prayed for that God showed me
[1:39:27] but I told the brothers I said if you
[1:39:28] ever want to fast and pray here at the
[1:39:30] church and sleep in here for a weekend
[1:39:31] and fast and pray let me know I'll be
[1:39:33] happy to join you happy to join you this
[1:39:35] is a serious thing we got little ones
[1:39:38] depending on us we got wives depending
[1:39:40] on us and we want to be in the right
[1:39:42] direction for the Lord is that something
[1:39:45] to take lightly something to seek God
[1:39:47] about in closing I'm at well how many
[1:39:49] minutes am I all right yeah at nine
[1:39:53] minutes okay so one more minute I'll try
[1:39:54] to close
[1:39:58] you how many thank God for those
[1:40:01] examples in the Bible real Godly leaders
[1:40:04] there's no better leader than a man
[1:40:05] who's filled with the Holy Ghost a man
[1:40:07] that's loving his wife loving his
[1:40:09] children praying for them asking God God
[1:40:12] how can I direct Malachi how can I
[1:40:14] direct Lydia my daughters how can I
[1:40:16] guide my wife to love you more those are
[1:40:18] the kind of prayers God loves to hear
[1:40:25] amen okay so let me uh close with this
[1:40:27] here Well's send our feet
[1:40:29] here I want to read this I want to read
[1:40:31] a little paragraph out of this book here
[1:40:34] I'm going to read a
[1:40:44] scripture I want to kind of close to
[1:40:46] this
[1:40:49] again let me just read this here when a
[1:40:52] man and woman marry they share high
[1:40:54] expectations they commit themselves to
[1:40:56] meet certain intents and intimate needs
[1:40:58] in each other on exclusive basis each
[1:41:02] agrees to forsake all others did
[1:41:03] everybody say that when they got married
[1:41:05] I'll forsake all others for you
[1:41:07] honey giving each other the exclusive
[1:41:09] right to meet those intimate needs that
[1:41:12] does not imply that all needs are to be
[1:41:14] met by a spouse that there are a few
[1:41:16] basic needs that most of us strictly
[1:41:18] reserve for the marriage bond most
[1:41:21] people expect their spouse to meet these
[1:41:23] Special Needs since they have agreed not
[1:41:25] to allow anyone else to meet them so I'm
[1:41:30] closing with
[1:41:32] that closing with
[1:41:35] that and I'm going to just read
[1:41:37] Ephesians 5 I told you I close of the
[1:41:38] scripture we're going back to Ephesians
[1:41:40] 5 when people get married they promise
[1:41:43] to God they promise to everybody I'm
[1:41:45] going to meet your needs I'm going to
[1:41:46] learn how to love you in other words I'm
[1:41:48] going to love you the way you need to be
[1:41:49] loved
[1:41:52] and if they don't keep that that's when
[1:41:53] trouble happens brother Braham said you
[1:41:55] need to be so in love so that when the
[1:41:56] Trials come you can understand each
[1:41:58] other and be patient and Grace can keep
[1:42:00] you
[1:42:01] together
[1:42:03] Hallelujah edans
[1:42:08] 5 verse 22 wives submit yourselves unto
[1:42:11] your own husbands as unto the
[1:42:13] Lord for the husband is the head of the
[1:42:16] wife even as Christ is the head of the
[1:42:17] church and he's the savior of the body
[1:42:20] therefore as the as the church is
[1:42:21] subject unto Christ so let the wives be
[1:42:24] to their own husbands in
[1:42:26] everything husbands love your wives even
[1:42:29] as Christ also loved the church and gave
[1:42:32] himself for it that he might sanctify
[1:42:34] and cleanse it with the washing of Water
[1:42:36] by the
[1:42:37] word that he might present it to himself
[1:42:39] a glorious church not having spot or
[1:42:41] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[1:42:43] should be holy and without blemish so
[1:42:45] ought men to love their wives as their
[1:42:47] own bodies he that loveth his wife loves
[1:42:50] loves himself think about that a man
[1:42:53] doesn't love his wife he don't really
[1:42:55] like himself right so he must be having
[1:42:57] a lot of inward battles right because if
[1:43:00] you love your wife you love yourself
[1:43:02] because she's a part of you you're one
[1:43:06] Spirit praise
[1:43:09] God now let's have let's just B our
[1:43:11] heads in a word of prayer here I just
[1:43:13] want to read a few things
[1:43:17] uh brother Bram said I send these on the
[1:43:19] the email this week brother Bram said
[1:43:21] now everyone wants to be loved I tell
[1:43:23] you the truth I
[1:43:27] do brother BR said the world's are
[1:43:29] looking for something today when your
[1:43:31] little wife told you she'd be your
[1:43:32] sweetheart and wife she was looking for
[1:43:34] somebody to love her and when you
[1:43:36] promised your husband she was he was
[1:43:37] looking for somebody to love as well he
[1:43:40] says that's what causes separation in
[1:43:42] families is the neglect of love I just
[1:43:45] want to stop right
[1:43:48] there now Church which just our heads
[1:43:50] bowed I just want to say first of all

[1:43:53] service and I know I'm sure it blessed

[1:43:57] want to give us a chance to think about
[1:43:58] our lives and our marriages and so forth
[1:44:01] like I said if you're not married you
[1:44:03] can think about your love for God are we
[1:44:06] neglecting any love for god let's just

[1:44:10] because of lack of love let's pray here
[1:44:13] Heavenly
[1:44:14] Father Lord we read your word we
[1:44:17] preached your word Lord God we've

[1:44:21] is so
[1:44:23] rich we've seen many many wonderful
[1:44:25] things
[1:44:27] tonight we've seen Lord that the Holy
[1:44:29] Spirit loves when a man is trying to win
[1:44:32] a wife he loves that because it's the
[1:44:34] type of
[1:44:35] Christ the Holy Spirit Lord tells the
[1:44:38] man enjoy love your family everywhere
[1:44:41] just don't go to another well just drink
[1:44:43] from your own water your own
[1:44:45] sisters enjoy your
[1:44:49] own
[1:44:51] and the Holy Spirit tells us that he's
[1:44:53] watching us men how we treat our wives
[1:44:56] and children you don't want to deal
[1:44:58] treacherously we want to deal
[1:45:00] fairly Lord the Holy Spirit tells us
[1:45:03] that as men we're God's provided leader
[1:45:06] for our family and we've got to stay in
[1:45:09] line with the Holy
[1:45:11] Spirit father as we close Lord God we
[1:45:14] look at these things Lord we made these
[1:45:16] vows and as a man I'm saying it and I'm
[1:45:18] sure the sisters would say it to their
[1:45:20] spouses I would say it Lord I promised
[1:45:22] my wife I would love her Lord I can't do
[1:45:25] that without your love so Lord I just
[1:45:28] pray God help me Lord to show to shine
[1:45:32] and reflect your love to my wife this
[1:45:34] week dear God help me to love my
[1:45:37] children this week help me to make more

[1:45:52] of my sins when I make a mistake and
[1:45:55] I'll try to devote more time to my wife
[1:45:57] and children God bless those hands and
[1:46:00] father Lord you saw their hands Lord
