[33:52] some look more than that let's just pray
[33:56] here that the God will speak to us
[33:58] through the word I sure enjoyed this
[34:00] morning's message I was thinking about
[34:02] my last time I Simon November preached
[34:04] on the open book right yeah times of the
[34:07] earth season of the open book so we're
[34:08] still in that time well thankful that
[34:10] God has opened his book to us us
[34:12] unworthy creatures right yeah
[34:14] but by his blood he makes us work with
[34:16] praise hey what's that word of Prayer
[34:26] [Music]
[34:47] higher class
[34:50] [Music]
[34:52] [Laughter]

[36:37] [Music]
[36:49] [Music]
[37:19] we're teaching here one of these days
[37:24] I'll do a song special it won't be as
[37:28] awkward as me just looking at you guys
[37:30] [Laughter]
[37:36] anyhow we're gonna dive back into the
[37:40] word by the grace of God and really your
[37:44] best to convey a thought
[37:51] you know a lot of some of the greatest
[37:53] songs okay
[38:00] some of the greatest songs and some of
[38:03] the probably that maybe might you would
[38:05] say maybe the most powerful messages
[38:08] some of the most powerful thoughts ever
[38:11] preached and brought forth in a church
[38:13] come from much suffering as we see it is
[38:19] well with my soul you know people have
[38:23] to endure tremendous hardships to really
[38:27] get a revelation of maybe something
[38:29] Laura's trying to convey so any I want
[38:35] to do a little teaching tonight by the
[38:36] grace again the grace of God again and
[38:39] hopefully this is a blessing were as we
[38:44] know we were definitely in we're only
[38:51] dosia and God has been awfully quiet you
[38:55] know as far as probably sixty years ago
[39:02] seventy years ago he was on the scene I
[39:05] mean moving constantly powerfully just
[39:11] [Music]
[39:13] in the way I'm sure he loved to move to
[39:18] display his power and His Majesty is
[39:22] healing ability is his divine love
[39:27] towards his children and and we'll start
[39:33] here in revelations five one look at
[39:37] that
[39:45] revelations 5-1 just going through the
[39:50] Old Testament now I want to see our day
[39:52] in the Old Testament you know what I
[39:53] want to see a brother had I talked with
[39:59] he said he's in the Old Testament is the
[40:01] glass brother he says it's the glass
[40:03] it's the mirror he said look into the
[40:05] Old Testament and they'll see he's is
[40:07] like he said he said he hold your Bible
[40:10] up like this use it and you'll see this
[40:13] is a window towards heaven and I kind of
[40:16] always took that with me and I've been
[40:20] looking at the Old Testament more and
[40:22] it's a book of prophecy yeah there was a
[40:25] lot of stories and a lot of things that
[40:30] have already come and gone but there's
[40:32] still many that is still prophetic so
[40:35] let's start here read this and then
[40:39] we'll say where to prayer after this
[40:40] these five scriptures here the Bible
[40:46] says and I saw in the right hand of him
[40:47] that sat at the throne a book written
[40:49] with within and on the backside sealed
[40:52] with seven seals and I saw a strong
[40:54] angel proclaiming with a loud voice who
[40:57] is worthy to open the book and to loose
[40:59] the seals thereof and no man in heaven
[41:03] nor on earth neither under the earth was
[41:06] able to open the book neither to look
[41:08] thereon and I went much because no man
[41:11] was found worthy to open and to read the
[41:13] book neither to look thereon and one of
[41:18] the elders saith unto me we've not
[41:20] behold the Tri the Lion of the tribe of
[41:23] Judah the root of David hath prevailed
[41:27] to open the book and to loose the seven
[41:28] seals thereof so let's say we're to
[41:31] prayer the only father Lord Jesus we
[41:35] just love you though we come humbly
[41:37] before your Lord on the evening service
[41:38] Lord we just want you to have your way
[41:40] Lord I want to project Lord thoughts in
[41:44] my heart their Lord that you placed you
[41:45] allowed me to be a witness Lord and in a
[41:49] distant kind of way Lord to a great
[41:52] tragedy Lord and or we just love you or
[41:56] take full control
[41:57] Oh Lord this little vessel Lord and I
[41:59] was out there or that are about to ready
[42:02] to take their seat Scott and or be with
[42:04] him where we want to be edifying Lord
[42:06] and to share Lord what you've just
[42:09] placed on my heart or we love you bless
[42:12] every soul Lord bless this house Lord
[42:14] bless this ministry or bust for Jesse
[42:16] over to Pastor Jess all the soldiers
[42:20] underneath here told me increase this
[42:21] Lord God give that increase to a god a
[42:24] double portion and where we love you so
[42:27] much in the name use Christ II man amen
[42:30] it might not necessarily be people but
[42:32] the Spirit of God who want the most in
[42:35] the most double portion of the Spirit of
[42:40] God is is the greatest thing I could
[42:42] think of that's coming that we're gonna
[42:44] get and it's gonna give us that extra
[42:47] boost that fuel that's gonna make this
[42:50] flight possible so here in Revelations
[42:55] 5-1 we know this we've all been through
[42:58] this many many times as you maybe you've
[43:01] listened to the message or study to
[43:03] yourself and thought on it through the
[43:05] day and and these kind of things and
[43:11] here he actually comes to take the book
[43:13] of redemption and and we know that if he
[43:15] would not have come and taken this know
[43:17] he had already paid for he has the now
[43:19] take it and claim it at his own this is
[43:22] this is this is my my creation I'm the
[43:25] problem said he said the reason John was
[43:27] weeping because he goes if he would not
[43:29] have taken it all everything would have
[43:31] been lost the devil would have won but
[43:36] here we see the Christ had come and take
[43:39] it it was there was no man to even look
[43:41] on it were they to even look on it have
[43:46] some thoughts there but anyhow as he
[43:48] opens seal by seal by seal Christ as he
[43:52] opens that he breaks the seal he Christ
[43:54] has nothing Christ has the book he
[43:57] breaks a Co he's probably looking or
[44:00] glaring or whatever but then he says
[44:02] nothing and then a beast will say
[44:05] something one of the zune says come and
[44:08] see and one of the Newman says come and
[44:10] see
[44:12] and then when we gets to the Seventh
[44:14] Seal and revelations 8:1 and when he had
[44:18] opened the Seventh Seal There was
[44:20] silence in heaven about the space of a
[44:23] half an hour so there's a there's a
[44:28] quiet time there's a time or I taught
[44:33] one a week a week ago we can have to go
[44:37] on God went to his place when he's gone
[44:41] done what he does on here he's done he
[44:43] goes he goes to his place and I brought
[44:45] it forth with a like a rebellious woman
[44:49] a dominating woman how if a man if a
[44:52] woman gets that dominating spirit on her
[44:56] a man will actually desire to dwell in
[45:00] the rooftop of a house you actually
[45:03] leave the confines of his comfort
[45:05] sometimes he even went into the forest
[45:07] with the wild beasts and the lions and
[45:10] tigers and spires and all kinds of
[45:13] things but God doesn't have to do that
[45:15] because he just goes back up to his
[45:17] place where all is comfort where his
[45:20] throne sets where he is king of kings
[45:22] and Lord of lords where he's receiving
[45:24] worship time and time and time again as
[45:28] the holy angels they would sing holy
[45:30] holy holy unto the Lord constantly
[45:33] without they never they never rest day
[45:35] and night they're always praising the
[45:36] king amen
[45:37] because wherever the presence of the God
[45:39] is you cannot be silent I I don't know
[45:42] how he would want to do that but but
[45:44] here as the Bible talks about and when
[45:47] he had opened the the Seventh Seal There
[45:49] was silence in heaven about the space of
[45:51] a half an hour so after God had done all
[45:54] this he had open seal open seal up and
[45:57] see you open this open this open this
[45:58] now there's a time of quietness a time
[46:03] of hush I would say like a holy
[46:06] reverence of huh sure and you know we'll
[46:10] get in this why the Prophet said that
[46:12] but uh but then here in Revelation is 10
[46:15] he comes down he blasts forth the seven
[46:20] thunders and then he told John sealed up
[46:23] don't write it
[46:28] so I guess tonight I like to teach on
[46:30] silence in the heaven and that sometime
[46:37] will be a space of time so and the
[46:44] inspiration of this kind of came to me I
[46:50] had been hearing rumors that some
[46:55] brothers were having just what we spoke
[46:58] a little bit on this morn they're having
[46:59] issues with some of the messaging and
[47:02] and they have not claimed to leave the
[47:06] message not to do away with anything we
[47:10] just they they just want answers we're
[47:13] looking we're looking for something
[47:14] solid I mean what why did this happen
[47:17] and what why was this set here the way
[47:18] it was said and and this didn't happen
[47:20] the way it was supposed to be said you
[47:22] know and this and that and however and
[47:26] then we see a tragedy a real tragedy
[47:28] happen and it it kind of moved me it
[47:38] kind of shook me a little bit on the on
[47:44] the aggressiveness of others I'll say
[47:47] like that it actually hurt me pretty bad
[47:52] and and I'm not very very very very very
[47:54] very tight with these individuals but I
[47:56] they're my acquaintances they're my
[47:57] brothers in Christ and as the Prophet
[48:00] taught us that whenever there's
[48:01] something that comes a down we were
[48:04] actually you know when the prophet of
[48:07] God was dealing the Baptist and he was
[48:09] dealing the Catholics he would call them
[48:10] or others but when it came to the
[48:12] Muhammadans he would call them friends
[48:16] see so if someone claims to be a
[48:19] follower of Jesus Christ they are our
[48:22] brothers I am not counting out anyone in
[48:28] any church because we don't know who is
[48:32] who
[48:34] but we're supposed to draw that circle
[48:36] bigger and not exclude them out okay now
[48:41] it would be a little bit difficult to
[48:43] have fellowship maybe with a Catholic
[48:45] priest where they will be talking about
[48:49] father they'd be talking about
[48:50] themselves I'm talking about father I'd
[48:52] be talking about God okay or they'd be
[48:55] talking about the Pope I'd be talking
[48:56] about Jesus Christ absolutely see so
[48:58] there's a there's a little bit of a
[48:59] problem there but as we got closer and
[49:01] closer to the truth maybe I'll jump to a
[49:03] Lutheran or a Baptist and even to the
[49:05] Pentecost now we can have a little
[49:06] better conversation a little bit better
[49:08] fellowship but I will never ever draw
[49:10] them out because what the time is not
[49:13] over yet
[49:15] the lamb has not come off the throne
[49:18] judgment she does not come forth so now
[49:22] we're still in the dispensation of grace
[49:24] and as the promise at one time he said
[49:25] he said a lot of times a lot of reasons
[49:28] that I thought I go to my brother's out
[49:31] here in the damnation the guy go out to
[49:32] you because I'm counting on that one
[49:35] chance
[49:35] I'm always believing that sometime one
[49:39] day they'll actually come out and
[49:41] receive what we have Baima and that's I
[49:45] believe what we should be doing in this
[49:47] in this what they call the message yeah
[49:49] but I call it Christianity amen the true
[49:52] the true belief the true faith I'll say
[49:56] like that email so dealing with silence
[49:59] in heaven I it was uh it was kind of an
[50:06] eye-opener on how these these brothers
[50:09] in that that church was treated they
[50:11] were treated horribly very sad situation
[50:15] but as I jump back here to Ezekiel and
[50:19] and I taught this months and months and
[50:21] months ago here well Jesse had allowed
[50:24] us to come and to teach these things so
[50:27] in Ezekiel 7 1 it says moreover the word
[50:32] Lord came to me saying also thou son of
[50:34] man does say the Lord God into the Land
[50:36] of Israel and the end the end is come
[50:40] upon the four corners of the land this
[50:42] is the end come upon thee now is the end
[50:45] come upon me so at the opening of this
[50:48] look the seals that all these things
[50:50] once that takes place we have now
[50:52] entered into the point of no return this
[50:56] now is time that when this moment this
[50:59] isn't a momentous occasion as even for
[51:02] the first maybe year before in 1962 the
[51:05] profit happens in all kind of anxiety
[51:07] there's something big coming there's
[51:09] something you just could not place it
[51:10] there
[51:12] now it was made known to him what it was
[51:14] to bring we knew that this this was a
[51:17] major thing here when for two thousand
[51:20] years the the Protestant church even the
[51:22] Catholic Church has hand the book of
[51:24] Revelation and they did not understand
[51:26] what all these symbolism meant in the
[51:29] Bible and then he comes down to the
[51:31] seals and was one of the seals open what
[51:33] is actually gonna take place is this
[51:36] later has it already done this this we
[51:38] nobody knew but in our day I'll say
[51:42] that's our parents day it took place and
[51:47] we're a generation or tube down now so
[51:51] but at that time it took place and when
[51:57] then it was the end and not only that he
[52:02] says in verse five thus saith the Lord
[52:04] God and evil and only an evil behold as
[52:06] common and has come and the end is come
[52:09] it's over
[52:12] done it this time it is done and then
[52:14] here in Ezekiel 11 there must have been
[52:19] a I'll say this there has to be a
[52:22] time-space here because as it was
[52:25] announced it is over Ezekiel announces
[52:27] over now people are starting to preach
[52:29] it is not near let us build houses for I
[52:32] know the things that coming in mind
[52:33] every one of them see so so address it
[52:36] was declared it's over God allows time
[52:40] to continue on for brief season he does
[52:43] not come down immediately it is not a
[52:45] heinous judgment brought down at the
[52:48] opening of this book but now he actually
[52:49] allows a space of time it got so much
[52:53] now to Ezekiel 1222 son of man what is
[52:56] this proverb that you have in the Land
[52:58] of Israel saying the days are prolonged
[53:00] and every vision failing are we not to
[53:04] that time people are doubting the
[53:05] barians of the prophet have these things
[53:08] failed up and on the bridge where is
[53:11] that documentation of 16 falling off the
[53:14] bridge into the water and drowning where
[53:16] is that as this failed tell them
[53:19] therefore they said let's say the Lord I
[53:21] will make this problem to cease and they
[53:23] shall no more use this as a proper
[53:24] drizzle but saying to them the days are
[53:26] at hand and the effect of every vision
[53:29] at this time now when the doubts are
[53:33] rising amongst the what these are the
[53:36] children of God this Ezekiel's dealing
[53:38] with Israel this is not the Hittites
[53:41] having rights the amorite any of those
[53:43] guys but he's dealing God is dealing
[53:45] with his what his people a man and now
[53:47] it has come down to that there's doubt
[53:51] God has allowed a portion of time just
[53:54] like here in Genesis 4 3 in the process
[53:57] of time it came to pass
[53:59] he brought forth Kay she brought forth
[54:02] abel and she not now think of this as i
[54:09] thought about this in now here in verse
[54:13] 3 says and in a process of time it came
[54:15] to pass but before then it was what eve
[54:19] was baby Cain and baby Abel
[54:25] and she would be nursing them and
[54:26] cuddling them changing diapers on them
[54:31] and however they hadn't fig leaf diapers
[54:33] or I don't know what they had but she
[54:35] would be taking care of these children
[54:36] and she raised his children up from
[54:38] babies and toddlers right and and as
[54:45] time would go on from from from infancy
[54:48] to this scripture Cain and Abel would
[54:53] get into little fights and squabbles and
[54:56] he would have to say oh I can't able
[54:59] beat now be good to one another hey quit
[55:02] doing that and you quit doing this and
[55:03] let's just hug and kiss remember brother
[55:05] Jess when we got it as children over at
[55:07] Holgate mom would make us hug and kiss
[55:09] each other on a cheek when we got in
[55:12] fights gotten disagreements and she
[55:16] would not let us do anything until we
[55:18] hugged and kissed each other I think we
[55:20] even ese we love I love you or something
[55:22] like that if I remember correctly so
[55:25] yeah that's this yeah so Eve would
[55:30] probably be under the same she's fresh
[55:31] out of the presence of God then knew
[55:33] what I was like back there fully pure
[55:35] fully happy and she would try I'm sure
[55:38] her any Adam would try and keep the
[55:40] family just like that and they'd raised
[55:42] up the children and this and that and as
[55:44] they got all her Cain would be a little
[55:46] bit more feisty maybe then Abel and Abel
[55:49] just try and take it and then and didn't
[55:51] know exactly what to do about it
[55:53] and they get fights and this and that
[55:55] and and I'm sure Abel was the tattletale
[55:57] because Cain was probably always picking
[55:59] on him I just had this feeling and and
[56:02] and and Abel would run to Eve and say
[56:04] mama mama came to this and she's like
[56:06] Cain I told you right
[56:10] just like a typical family things
[56:15] speaking up things little little
[56:17] troubles here little troubles there you
[56:21] know you know what what we just had the
[56:23] church age study uh we've been having
[56:26] every Saturday night and two weeks ago
[56:28] something Lord opened up something
[56:29] powerful as we were going through and
[56:31] remember years and years and years ago
[56:34] when I told you about the second lie and
[56:37] how Eve said
[56:38] that cane was of the Lord and that's
[56:40] actually the second line in the Bible
[56:42] eager cane was not of the Lord but and
[56:45] that was the beginning of Eve's
[56:47] revelation if you look at the end of
[56:50] Revelations or Genesis 4 Eve's mindset
[56:54] now is different he says now he says God
[56:58] has given me another seed instead of
[57:01] Abel whom Cain slew she realized now
[57:06] that Cain was not seed she actually had
[57:11] the revelation now that this was not one
[57:15] in the same these had new different
[57:17] daddies this was not of God this one was
[57:20] I said but Adam knew Eve again and God
[57:24] gave them another seed the godly seed
[57:28] and she was able to have a revelation
[57:30] now by discernment by the what took
[57:33] place in that time she said ah now I see
[57:37] my error so as they were growing up in
[57:42] time and time again they would get in
[57:44] fights and who knows what and this and
[57:46] that but but he would always try to
[57:49] bring them and make them happy and just
[57:51] try to bring the family together to to
[57:53] have a little joy get away with the
[57:59] strife for the stripes over we gotta get
[58:00] down with the stripes right but notice
[58:03] it was in a process of time later as
[58:07] they grow up now they started to have
[58:09] this desire to serve God after all
[58:14] little fights growing up and Iran
[58:17] wrestling and they caught they caught
[58:21] what a holding call one day brother
[58:24] holding glue she he called it
[58:26] roughhousing
[58:27] roughhousing is that we're just
[58:28] roughhousing and running around them
[58:30] this and that and rolling around and
[58:31] putting each other and headlocks and
[58:32] those sort of things but as they started
[58:37] growing up and they wanted to be
[58:38] Christian they wanted to serve God
[58:41] Almighty they wanted to serve Jehovah
[58:43] they
[58:46] start to offer up their sacrifices right
[58:49] now remember God was silent this entire
[58:53] time as they grow up we see him then
[58:57] kick Adam and Eve out and he's silent
[59:01] and then as in a process of time worship
[59:07] starts and people want to be accepted
[59:09] and and God then vindicates one and not
[59:12] the other now we got a problem some
[59:15] jealousy may rise up between brothers
[59:19] and brothers in the message and in
[59:22] process of time it came to pass that
[59:24] Cain brought forth the fruit of the
[59:25] ground an offering unto the Lord right
[59:29] now look at the Prophet says just wait a
[59:31] minute God interprets his own word by
[59:33] its own terms that he spoke it in she
[59:36] God interprets don't work see Cain he
[59:38] said I am religious I am a lover of my
[59:40] maker I offer to thee in this fine offer
[59:43] I offered to you this sacrifice I built
[59:45] all these things up Lord because I love
[59:47] you Abel said the same thing now it's
[59:50] the one that's vindicated the one that's
[59:52] proven and God come down and receive
[59:54] Abel's sacrifice because by revelation
[59:57] he had struck the true channel of God
[59:59] that was accepted right Amen now watch
[1:00:02] that Cain spirit come right down through
[1:00:05] the scripture right on his way to the
[1:00:06] very last day fundamental just as
[1:00:09] fundamental as the other one once look
[1:00:12] at that Prophet Balaam and the prophet
[1:00:14] Moses both of them with seven altars
[1:00:16] jehovah's altar his blood on each one he
[1:00:18] says not only that but the rams of each
[1:00:20] one and who morality exactly like the
[1:00:21] number seven perfect seven Rams just
[1:00:23] exactly like both altars fundamentally
[1:00:26] they were exactly the same
[1:00:28] but who did God vindicate see see that
[1:00:32] the one that was in his word fundamental
[1:00:35] doesn't mean too much it's the
[1:00:37] revelation of God see so what I what I
[1:00:42] uh I will just hit this - here he says
[1:00:47] now think these men why was they called
[1:00:48] and was put in this condition these
[1:00:50] Pharisees by Jesus said in vain you were
[1:00:53] should be worshiping January worship
[1:00:55] true worship from their hearts
[1:00:57] he says you in vain you worship me
[1:00:59] whitey
[1:01:00] Schieffer doctor and their commandments
[1:01:02] of man tradition of man therefore you
[1:01:05] make the commands of God of no effect to
[1:01:07] the people so whatever we we offer to
[1:01:11] God must be true it must not come from
[1:01:15] anything but the Word of God as I was
[1:01:18] talking to a brother the other day he
[1:01:19] said brother he was oh I wish I was like
[1:01:21] this and I've seen every fault and
[1:01:23] failure I made he says and he was he was
[1:01:25] kind of magnifying his brother in his
[1:01:26] church and this and this and this and
[1:01:28] the whole time I keep coming back I said
[1:01:31] when it comes down to all of it as her
[1:01:37] brother had told me he was in the
[1:01:39] presence of God and he said I put all
[1:01:41] the good that I had done for him and he
[1:01:45] said to God it meant nothing he put all
[1:01:48] the bad in Lord Zee's I failed at this
[1:01:50] so filled this Lord filled this and he
[1:01:52] put him before God and it meant nothing
[1:01:55] what pleased God was he wanted to hear
[1:01:59] what he had done what God had done see
[1:02:02] once so when you compare yourself to
[1:02:04] someone else you're adding that person
[1:02:06] you're saying that his was right his is
[1:02:08] gonna be accepted in yours wound the
[1:02:10] only thing is going to be accepted as
[1:02:12] Jesus Christ's sacrifice it's the blood
[1:02:15] and the blood alone you can't add
[1:02:18] anything to that blood you can't add
[1:02:20] anything to what he did he did it uh-huh
[1:02:22] all righteousness the very best we can
[1:02:26] do is as filthy rags so it's simple what
[1:02:31] do we offer up Christ himself nor I am
[1:02:34] so thankful for what you did on that day
[1:02:37] I thank you for suffering I thank you
[1:02:39] for giving your life I thank you for for
[1:02:40] going down and preach you to taking this
[1:02:42] those keys from the devil I think if
[1:02:44] we're raising up from the dead and and
[1:02:46] then sending back your spirit upon demon
[1:02:48] because that's what he did amen we were
[1:02:51] lost there was nothing else we could
[1:02:53] have done we were absolutely hopeless we
[1:02:55] had not a hope or in the world so in
[1:02:59] this process of time this quietness this
[1:03:03] silence as I looked here and this kind
[1:03:07] of jumped out at to me here and we talks
[1:03:09] about and I think brother Jesse had done
[1:03:11] us a study on this the 28 days of
[1:03:13] time and these things and into
[1:03:15] everything there is a season a season
[1:03:19] everything has a season we know that by
[1:03:21] by natural by nature even look at your
[1:03:26] mind sets you go through seasons of your
[1:03:28] mind since while you're up today and
[1:03:29] you're maybe down to this day or you're
[1:03:31] battling this and it's a lot of times it
[1:03:33] comes round again you keep it seems like
[1:03:35] it just comes you you're battling kind
[1:03:37] of the same things listen ad if we don't
[1:03:39] overcome I'm and if we do overcome them
[1:03:41] maybe God will give us something greater
[1:03:42] along the same lines to make sure that
[1:03:44] virtue sticks in you and grows what was
[1:03:48] the virtue of Christ amen so all these
[1:03:51] time our time to weep a time to laugh a
[1:03:54] time to mourn time to dance all those
[1:03:55] things the time to get a time to lose a
[1:03:57] time to keep and a time to cast away but
[1:04:01] notice this here and a time to Rend to
[1:04:07] break down and a time to sow which is
[1:04:11] like a restoration and then he says a
[1:04:13] time to keep silence so God has already
[1:04:19] sent the Prophet to restore the word and
[1:04:21] now all of a sudden he's silent but
[1:04:26] there's coming another day where he's
[1:04:31] going to speak what's next if there are
[1:04:35] silence in the air if there's silence in
[1:04:38] heaven and he's been silenced here on
[1:04:41] earth for the most part there's a time
[1:04:45] where he's going to come and speak and
[1:04:46] directly after he speaks is going to
[1:04:49] produce a love within us if you study
[1:04:54] Ephraim Ephraim was one of the sons of
[1:04:58] Joseph and and and Joseph brought
[1:05:02] Ephraim Manasseh before Jacob and Jacob
[1:05:05] crossed his hands put the right hand
[1:05:06] blessing on Ephraim instead of Manasseh
[1:05:09] typing what that through the cross the
[1:05:11] blessing would go to the Gentile and if
[1:05:14] you look at em from all the way through
[1:05:15] the Old Testament Ephraim actually went
[1:05:17] into idolatry the type of the Gentile
[1:05:19] Ephraim has went into a full pride mode
[1:05:23] ever went into pol idolatry worshipping
[1:05:26] a
[1:05:26] idols and this and that but there is a
[1:05:29] scripture I taught her that last time I
[1:05:30] taught at home where the Bible says that
[1:05:34] Ephraim said Ephraim said he said why
[1:05:39] would I even care about I'm gonna cast
[1:05:41] all my idols away he said because I have
[1:05:44] heard the voice of God so once he went
[1:05:49] to fold idolatry God said leave him
[1:05:51] alone don't mess with him don't mess
[1:05:56] with them what God was silent towards
[1:05:58] them but when it came down to it there
[1:06:00] was a time to speak as well he says and
[1:06:04] after we get through this love period
[1:06:06] where God speaks and we fall in love
[1:06:08] with him our hearts has turned back to
[1:06:09] him and then what a time of hate because
[1:06:12] what we go up the hatred the judgment
[1:06:14] drops down a time of war and then
[1:06:17] busting out into the Millennium peace I
[1:06:21] just see that I don't know but I just
[1:06:24] correct me if I'm wrong I just see right
[1:06:28] here the end times every move boom boom
[1:06:30] boom exactly exactly according to
[1:06:33] Scripture hey man now let's look at this
[1:06:36] year by the grace of God so we have a
[1:06:37] time to keep silent and the time to
[1:06:39] speak we know there is a speaking time
[1:06:41] coming but why did God leave the silence
[1:06:51] look at look at his eye on here
[1:06:53] lamentations 2 and 14 thy prophets have
[1:06:56] seen vain visions and foolish things for
[1:06:59] the they have not discovered thine
[1:07:00] iniquity to turn away thy captivity but
[1:07:03] they have seen for the false burdens and
[1:07:06] causes of banishment he's all that
[1:07:08] passed by clap their hands at thee and
[1:07:11] they hiss smack their head and at the
[1:07:13] daughter of Jerusalem saying is this the
[1:07:16] city that men call perfection the
[1:07:18] perfection of beauty the joy of the Lord
[1:07:22] so here are people mocking what Zion the
[1:07:27] bride of Jesus Christ saying all this
[1:07:29] they're nothing there's nothing to them
[1:07:31] they have no strength or the power of
[1:07:33] Gaza a decline in their ministries the
[1:07:36] anointing is declining this and this is
[1:07:38] the people that garlotte their
[1:07:40] was a believer prophet and this is not
[1:07:42] and however all thine enemies have
[1:07:46] opened their mouths against thee they
[1:07:47] hiss and gnashed her teeth they say we
[1:07:49] have swallowed her up certainly this is
[1:07:51] the day that we have looked for we have
[1:07:52] found her we have seen it
[1:07:55] she's got nothing we're gonna set the
[1:07:58] stage we're gonna set traps for this and
[1:08:01] that and she's done for but look look
[1:08:04] how low she's gotten and of whom has now
[1:08:08] been afraid or feared that thou has that
[1:08:11] thou has lied and has to remember and
[1:08:13] has not remembered me nor laid it to thy
[1:08:15] heart have not I held my peace even of
[1:08:19] old and I'll fierce me not here God he
[1:08:22] said he says he says why don't you come
[1:08:25] back to me why are not your hearts been
[1:08:27] fully turned he says I've held my peace
[1:08:29] what he sent as a messenger we have over
[1:08:33] a thousand twelve hundred servants and
[1:08:35] he we can listen to him time and time
[1:08:36] again we have the live fivefold ministry
[1:08:39] working right now amongst the bride and
[1:08:41] why I'm now a heart slowly turned back
[1:08:44] to him have not I held my peace I let
[1:08:48] you guys do this when I wondered why is
[1:08:53] there a silence he's allowing is he's
[1:08:57] allowing this silence because it's just
[1:09:00] like grace what's what's the one of the
[1:09:03] greatest deceptions about grace for the
[1:09:05] false seed line in the old testament if
[1:09:08] I would sin a sin and be caught a lot of
[1:09:13] the chances that the punishment was to
[1:09:14] be stoning death instantaneously dragged
[1:09:17] him out of the city and everybody the
[1:09:19] whole congregation comes out and stone
[1:09:21] him stole him
[1:09:22] but in grace a lot of times nothing
[1:09:27] happens the first time
[1:09:30] I did this certain sin I was like wow I
[1:09:32] don't know if I should do this I was
[1:09:34] like 18 19 I really don't know why she'd
[1:09:36] do this I did it
[1:09:38] no Thunderbolt no thunder no lightning
[1:09:43] no judgment and it made my next step a
[1:09:47] little easier nothing happened and I
[1:09:52] continued to grow and more and more
[1:09:53] wickedness and and doing more and more
[1:09:55] evil things why because we're under a
[1:09:58] grace mode rather a grace dispensation
[1:10:01] right now and maybe God is allowing
[1:10:04] these things maybe he's allowing himself
[1:10:06] to be silent to see what people will do
[1:10:10] and go see how far people will go in
[1:10:13] their evilness their wickedness and God
[1:10:18] holds his peace just letting it all
[1:10:20] happen
[1:10:22] his psalm of Asaph the mighty god even
[1:10:26] the god has spoken and called the earth
[1:10:28] from the rise in his son even to the
[1:10:30] going down there of out of zion the
[1:10:32] perfection of beauty god has shined our
[1:10:35] god shall come and shall not keep
[1:10:39] silence see the Seventh Seal silence is
[1:10:43] going to Edwin Lee
[1:10:44] when these days this thing's gonna be
[1:10:46] all over he is going to speak a man he's
[1:10:49] gonna speak to his nine spiritual gifts
[1:10:50] he's going to speak to us fivefold
[1:10:51] ministry he's going to speak through his
[1:10:53] people and God will be heard once again
[1:10:56] on the on the four corners of the earth
[1:10:57] amen he said he will not keep silence a
[1:11:02] fire showed the power to before man it
[1:11:05] shall be very temperature around about
[1:11:06] him he shall call to the heavens from
[1:11:08] above into the earth that he may judge
[1:11:09] his people a man gathered what'd he say
[1:11:12] Jesus gather my Saints unto me those are
[1:11:14] the main accompany with me by a
[1:11:16] sacrifice then the heavens shall declare
[1:11:18] his righteousness a judge himself saying
[1:11:22] man absolutely he promised he would not
[1:11:25] keep silent forever he doesn't call upon
[1:11:28] me in the day of trouble out of it
[1:11:29] deliver thee and thou shalt glorify me
[1:11:33] absolutely so he's keeping silence maybe
[1:11:36] he wants us to start speaking to him
[1:11:38] more often and longer periods of time my
[1:11:42] wife had just while
[1:11:43] the video of a man who was being
[1:11:46] tortured it was tortured for 14 years
[1:11:49] under a communist rule
[1:11:52] 14 years of torture for praying if he
[1:11:58] was calling the South praying he was
[1:12:00] beaten right then and thrown back in and
[1:12:02] he said he would start praying again it
[1:12:05] actually strengthened him they beat his
[1:12:08] feet so much they he the rest of his
[1:12:10] life he never walked again right
[1:12:13] never walked right and these were
[1:12:18] message thoroughbreds Pentecost this was
[1:12:23] a Lutheran they loved God so much that
[1:12:28] they would even preach to to each other
[1:12:30] and when they got caught the one that
[1:12:33] was preaching would always be beaten
[1:12:34] they'd come back in the room they said
[1:12:37] where did we leave off and started
[1:12:38] preaching again 14 years the wife his
[1:12:44] wife he was a pastor his wife was taken
[1:12:46] into the camps - made to work hard labor
[1:12:49] carry stones work like a man - all those
[1:12:51] things they captured his son took him
[1:12:54] into a Cell beat him in front of him he
[1:12:56] cried out I'll tell you every time it
[1:12:58] and then they killed him and he served
[1:13:00] God for 14 years in the prisons he was
[1:13:05] sent into the most into room number four
[1:13:08] where they saw everyone that got sick
[1:13:09] that would die they send a number of
[1:13:10] room number four because that's where
[1:13:11] they're gonna die when they got so bad
[1:13:14] they send the room four
[1:13:15] and he was sent to room four and he did
[1:13:16] not perish for weeks and weeks and weeks
[1:13:19] and as one would go in and die another
[1:13:23] one go and die he would lead him to the
[1:13:24] Lord surrounded by death sick himself
[1:13:29] amen
[1:13:30] and then God would anoint one of his
[1:13:32] converts to go undercover it and he's a
[1:13:35] doctor and gave him this the the
[1:13:38] medicine needed to get out and he got
[1:13:39] out he lived 14 years and he founded the
[1:13:42] voice of the martyrs 14 years and we
[1:13:47] have it rough anyone have a rough day
[1:13:50] I haven't had a rough day yet
[1:13:53] I've never been physically beaten for
[1:13:55] reading the Bible or praying or anything
[1:13:58] we are very blessed right now a mom now
[1:14:04] continue on here he says it Psalms 50
[1:14:08] verse 16 but unto the wicked God saith
[1:14:13] what has thou to to do to declare my
[1:14:16] statutes and what the house should is
[1:14:18] take my covenant in thy mouth seeing
[1:14:21] thou hatest instruction and casting my
[1:14:23] words behind the they're starting to
[1:14:25] preach God's Word these people here
[1:14:28] started to preach God's Word and God
[1:14:31] says why you preaching my word we don't
[1:14:32] even owe bayen you don't even like it
[1:14:35] when thou saw'st so thief thou consent
[1:14:38] us with him and has been partaker with
[1:14:41] it alters look at everything he's now
[1:14:44] give us thy mouth to evil night on
[1:14:46] Freimuth deceit now citizens speakers
[1:14:50] against thy brother
[1:14:51] now slanders thine own mother's son
[1:14:53] these things has now done and I kept
[1:14:56] silence I wonder if that time was
[1:15:01] silence in heaven not only on earth but
[1:15:04] God is watching the Seas manifest what I
[1:15:09] saw down south what it was it was an
[1:15:12] absolute spiritual martyrdom the brother
[1:15:16] one just once and wants to talk he
[1:15:18] called for a meeting he wanted to find
[1:15:21] some answers and they threw him out
[1:15:24] he's no longer amongst us these things
[1:15:29] thou hast done and I kept silent now
[1:15:32] thoughtless that I was altogether such
[1:15:34] as one as thyself but I will repute
[1:15:36] reprove thee and set them in order
[1:15:39] before thine eyes now consider this ye
[1:15:41] that forget God lest I tear you in
[1:15:42] pieces and there be none to deliver you
[1:15:44] who sober offer praise glorified me into
[1:15:48] him that offers his conversation right
[1:15:52] well I showed us shoe the salvation of
[1:15:54] God amen
[1:15:55] see this is why we must always have a
[1:15:58] grace I don't know the condition right
[1:16:01] now presently of that situation but I
[1:16:03] tell you what he's my brother
[1:16:06] and no not only that I would not take
[1:16:08] the opinion of someone else I called for
[1:16:12] a meeting with the brother on the phone
[1:16:14] and I heard from his mouth what took
[1:16:18] place where he's standing and I found if
[1:16:22] he's telling me the truth all the rest
[1:16:24] are liars in that day when God shall
[1:16:32] judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ
[1:16:34] according to my gospel Paul says this
[1:16:37] word that I've received is directly from
[1:16:40] the Lord God Almighty this revelation
[1:16:42] even the things he allowed that I came
[1:16:45] from me he allowed to be put in the
[1:16:47] scripture he says thus saith the Lord he
[1:16:50] says now look he says and art thou
[1:16:52] confident verse 19 the tower thyself art
[1:16:55] a guide to the blind and light of them
[1:16:57] in darkness and in structure of the
[1:16:58] foolish a teacher of babes which thou
[1:17:01] has the form of knowledge and of the
[1:17:02] truth of law now therefore which teaches
[1:17:05] another teachers not thyself all these
[1:17:08] men are preachers this preachers
[1:17:09] preaching preaching preaching preaching
[1:17:11] and yet they don't have enough love for
[1:17:13] this brother down south and they throw
[1:17:17] them out and belittle him write letters
[1:17:19] and what's that messages about them
[1:17:23] throwing them out cast them out into
[1:17:25] denominational world now let's say
[1:17:30] the man should not commit adultery does
[1:17:32] thou commit adultery now that abhorrest
[1:17:34] idols does thou commit sacrilege
[1:17:36] now that makest thy boast law through
[1:17:38] breaking the law dishonor style God for
[1:17:41] the name of your God is blasting him on
[1:17:43] the book among the Gentiles through you
[1:17:44] as it is written the Bible says in James
[1:17:48] 2 he says if you break 1/10 of the law
[1:17:52] you're guilty of it all there's no
[1:17:56] cutting we can boast in ourselves Saints
[1:17:59] outside of Christ Jesus he says keep
[1:18:02] down I still oh god hold not thy peace
[1:18:05] and be not still O God for lo thine
[1:18:07] enemies make a tumult and they that hate
[1:18:09] them lifted up the head they have taken
[1:18:12] crafty a counsel against thy people and
[1:18:14] consulted against thy hidden ones oh my
[1:18:16] it looks like they're coming after the
[1:18:18] bride it looks like they're trying to
[1:18:21] break up this message churches looks
[1:18:22] like they're trying to cause division
[1:18:24] amongst the people a man hmm
[1:18:27] one by one dividing this brother from
[1:18:30] that brother dividing this and dividing
[1:18:31] that and whatever this fellowship hmm he
[1:18:40] says now he says hold not thy peace O
[1:18:46] God of my praise for the mouth the
[1:18:48] wicked in the mouth of the deceitful are
[1:18:50] open against me and they have spoken
[1:18:52] against me with the lying tongue and the
[1:18:55] Old Testament called false bearing false
[1:18:57] witness
[1:18:59] they have compass me about also with the
[1:19:02] words of hatred and fought against me
[1:19:04] without a cause well I just want answers
[1:19:06] can we talk about this can you reread
[1:19:09] the Bible talks about reasoning amongst
[1:19:10] ourselves and coming to like a godly
[1:19:12] answer to the best conformed thought we
[1:19:15] can maybe II conjure up by the grace of
[1:19:17] God through the Word of God for the
[1:19:18] spirit all those things come up with the
[1:19:24] compass my
[1:19:25] about me with the words of a hatred and
[1:19:27] fought against me without a cause for my
[1:19:29] love they are they are my adversaries
[1:19:31] but I give myself unto prayer and that's
[1:19:34] exactly what he's with this brother said
[1:19:36] he was doing he's the brother it's
[1:19:37] caused me to draw closer to Christ and
[1:19:39] back to the word if you actually say
[1:19:47] something about this message and you
[1:19:48] doubt this and well I don't know what he
[1:19:50] really meant here you were actually you
[1:19:52] or they were cast out right away there's
[1:19:55] no grace for you and they that and they
[1:19:58] have rewarded me evil for good and
[1:20:00] hatred for my love of course we have
[1:20:04] this Judas Scripture and psalms one on
[1:20:06] 109 six to thirteen and wicked man and
[1:20:10] those sort of things here in Isaiah 42
[1:20:14] verse 12 he says let them give glory
[1:20:16] into the Lord and clear his praise in
[1:20:18] the islands
[1:20:18] the Lord shall go forth as a mighty man
[1:20:21] he shall stir up jealousy like a man of
[1:20:24] war he shall cry a roar he shall prevail
[1:20:28] against his enemies
[1:20:29] I have long time he says holding my
[1:20:32] peace but I have been still and
[1:20:35] refrained myself he was ready to attack
[1:20:39] way back then he was ready for judgment
[1:20:41] way back then he says but now he says I
[1:20:46] will cry like a travailing woman I'll
[1:20:47] destroy and devour once what when God is
[1:20:50] fed up when the with a cup of iniquity
[1:20:51] of the air rises flow it's time to bring
[1:20:54] it I will make waste hills and mountains
[1:21:00] and hills and dry up all the herbs and
[1:21:02] I'll make their rivers islands and I
[1:21:04] will drive the pools and I'll bring the
[1:21:06] blind by the way they new nods and I
[1:21:08] will lead them and paths which they have
[1:21:09] not known I will make nart darkness
[1:21:11] light before them and crooked things
[1:21:13] straight amen these things like I doing
[1:21:15] to them and not forsake them it looks
[1:21:18] like his bride is about ready to suffer
[1:21:20] some problems here looks like she might
[1:21:23] be going into some persecution and and
[1:21:25] the mighty lion the tribe of Judah has
[1:21:27] had enough people have risen up against
[1:21:30] the bride people have rosin up against
[1:21:32] his love and now he is done he is fed up
[1:21:36] and it's time to settle this
[1:21:40] the time of silence it's he's going to
[1:21:42] roar soon behold as written before me he
[1:21:47] says I will not keep silence but
[1:21:49] recompense even recompense into their
[1:21:51] bosom your iniquities and your
[1:21:53] iniquities of your fathers together
[1:21:55] saith the LORD which have burned incense
[1:21:56] upon the mountains and blasphemy in the
[1:21:58] hills
[1:21:58] therefore I measure their former work
[1:22:00] into their bosom thus saith the Lord as
[1:22:03] the new light is found in the cluster
[1:22:05] and one saith destroy it not for as a
[1:22:08] blessing and it's all due to my servants
[1:22:09] sake that I may not destroy them all God
[1:22:11] is going to send more revelation and
[1:22:13] more revelation and more revelation what
[1:22:16] even in the time of his silence he's
[1:22:18] going to bring forth things that are
[1:22:19] going to set his bride alive he's now
[1:22:21] bring forth a seat on a Jacob not am I
[1:22:23] out of Judah an inheritor of my
[1:22:26] mountains and minor lacs shall inherit
[1:22:28] it and my servant shall dwell there amen
[1:22:30] God will not always be silent Saints we
[1:22:35] actually have lived in a time much like
[1:22:37] time before the first coming of Christ
[1:22:39] there was no prophet silent for hundreds
[1:22:42] and hundreds and hundreds of years no
[1:22:44] one had a clue what was going on until
[1:22:46] John the Baptist up unseen and then
[1:22:49] Jesus stepped up the scene and now we
[1:22:51] have a no Church but now we what we've
[1:22:53] been 60 years without hearing a prophet
[1:22:56] he didn't store up the meat he didn't
[1:22:58] store but now where is who is preaching
[1:23:00] the fresh manna who is preaching the
[1:23:02] true revelation of Jesus Christ amen but
[1:23:08] we see in the back scenes we see how
[1:23:11] brothers treat one another in the
[1:23:13] message hope I'm not getting too
[1:23:16] personal I'm just saying this I mean you
[1:23:20] can't hide actions actions don't lie you
[1:23:25] can see people say I love you but the
[1:23:27] way they treat you is another way
[1:23:28] another thing that's that's the telltale
[1:23:31] right there how they treat actions are
[1:23:34] the saying is true actions speak louder
[1:23:36] than words are they
[1:23:42] 1-9 awake awake put on strength or arm
[1:23:45] of the Lord awake as in the ancient days
[1:23:48] in the generations of always Lord I want
[1:23:51] to see you as he in time of Moses I want
[1:23:53] to see you in the time of Abraham and
[1:23:56] Jacob and Isaac he's I want to see all
[1:23:57] these things absolutely I want to see
[1:23:59] the God on the scene make a man fall a
[1:24:01] power full of zealousness absolutely
[1:24:04] someone that would come on and just
[1:24:05] deliver us art thou not here they cut
[1:24:08] Rahab and wounded the dragon verse 11 he
[1:24:12] says therefore the redeemed Lord shall
[1:24:14] return and come with her singing unto
[1:24:16] Zion and everlasting joy shall be upon
[1:24:19] her hands he something is going to
[1:24:21] strike us when that ladder rain hits and
[1:24:24] whatever would all that entails whatever
[1:24:26] it is in that seventh seal whatever
[1:24:28] entails is going to be so great is going
[1:24:31] to change things we have great promises
[1:24:37] amen from the Bible we have great things
[1:24:39] that God is going to do I even I am he
[1:24:42] that comforts you look there's the
[1:24:44] comforter right there the Holy Ghost who
[1:24:46] art out that that shouldn't be afraid of
[1:24:48] a man that shall die and the son of man
[1:24:50] which shall be made as grass verse 16
[1:24:58] put my words in thy mouth and I have
[1:25:00] covered thee in the shadow might hand
[1:25:02] and I my that I may plant the heavens
[1:25:04] and lay the foundation earth and say in
[1:25:06] desire and thou art my people see God is
[1:25:08] going to he will not leave his people
[1:25:10] suffer forever and have we suffered much
[1:25:14] but in the mind in the confusion
[1:25:17] everything's gray right now the
[1:25:20] prophesied gray that color the color of
[1:25:23] confusion and deception because it's
[1:25:26] neither black nor white let's continue
[1:25:30] on here Psalms won over some seven six
[1:25:33] arise O Lord in thine anger lift up
[1:25:35] thyself because of the rage of mine
[1:25:38] enemies and awake for me to the judgment
[1:25:41] that thou has commanded there was coming
[1:25:43] a time where God where the saints of God
[1:25:45] are gonna be put onto it
[1:25:46] yes we're gonna we're gonna see some
[1:25:49] things and uh God will come have to come
[1:25:54] off that throne and when that happens
[1:25:56] it's it's gonna be he's gonna be a lion
[1:25:58] this could be lion mode then we saw what
[1:26:01] he did in lion mode number one we'll see
[1:26:04] it again here a repeat performance in
[1:26:05] number two yay for thy sake we are
[1:26:09] killed all the day long we are accounted
[1:26:11] as sheep for the slaughter awake why
[1:26:13] sleepest Thou O Lord arise castis not
[1:26:16] off forever wherefore hidest
[1:26:18] thy face and forget us our friction in
[1:26:21] our oppression for our soul is bowed
[1:26:23] down to the dust and our buddy belly
[1:26:25] cleaveth to the earth arise for help and
[1:26:27] a redeem us for thy Mercy's sake things
[1:26:31] of God how Bad's gonna get in America
[1:26:33] look at what they look at the cry of the
[1:26:36] bride here God has been silent she's
[1:26:40] suffering something terrible and just
[1:26:42] like the children of Israel were on
[1:26:44] Egypt and their taskmasters were hard
[1:26:47] and making more brick more slime more
[1:26:49] MORE all those things until they
[1:26:51] couldn't take into more lace and the
[1:26:52] Bible said that God heard the cries of
[1:26:54] his people and said a deliverer this may
[1:26:57] have another repeat performance as well
[1:26:59] I don't know what's coming but God is
[1:27:02] going to allow us to get the point where
[1:27:04] we're gonna say Lord please don't keep
[1:27:06] silent speak to us once more come down
[1:27:10] and bring your mighty power Eman
[1:27:14] many times the Prophet said it's going
[1:27:17] to be it's going to get rough now notice
[1:27:20] here's a naughty person a wicked man
[1:27:23] walketh with a froward mouth he wink it
[1:27:26] in his eyes he speaketh with his feet he
[1:27:27] teaches with his fingers Fordyce forward
[1:27:32] misses in his heart he devised mischief
[1:27:34] he soweth discord
[1:27:37] I like how they said that he saw with
[1:27:39] discord now why is that because if you
[1:27:43] look at the definition of discord
[1:27:48] disagreement between people they try to
[1:27:53] put a wedge between people a lack of
[1:27:58] harmony between between notes sounding
[1:28:02] together a lack of harmony and
[1:28:05] disagreements conflict friction
[1:28:08] hostility that is someone who's of
[1:28:11] discord who so is a discord they don't
[1:28:15] want to get along or they don't want
[1:28:18] certain people to get along and notice
[1:28:22] how this says here in proverbs 6 verse
[1:28:23] 16 and I pulled off bars on us because I
[1:28:28] like what he said about it these six
[1:28:30] things doth the Lord hate he says 6
[1:28:33] right but then he says yay someone says
[1:28:37] yay seven are an abomination to him why
[1:28:40] did they do that why does why do that
[1:28:42] because they've done it a couple times
[1:28:43] in the in Proverbs I believe they'd
[1:28:44] always say this number then that well
[1:28:45] there's oh yeah there's an extra one
[1:28:47] why didn't just come out and say there's
[1:28:49] seven well look what look what look o
[1:28:52] barn says here like this he says and the
[1:28:56] seventh he says the teacher here
[1:28:58] enumerates six qualities of detestable
[1:29:01] things that are just wicked and the
[1:29:05] seventh is worse than all separate seven
[1:29:09] represents completeness but all this but
[1:29:13] all the seven in this instance belong to
[1:29:15] one man the man of Belial Wow
[1:29:19] see so here he said there's six things
[1:29:21] that I hate he's about seven does God
[1:29:23] count abomination you said that seventh
[1:29:25] one is the
[1:29:26] one God hates discord
[1:29:31] what kind of discord a false witness to
[1:29:35] speaketh lies and he that sow discord
[1:29:36] among the church our own brothers in
[1:29:43] this message and God said he hates that
[1:29:51] and they'll preach over the pulpit said
[1:29:54] you better love your enemies you better
[1:29:56] love those that this and you better love
[1:29:58] and bring God's divine not oh I got
[1:30:00] divine love and yet if a brother
[1:30:01] disagrees with one thing they're out you
[1:30:05] know write letters about them telling
[1:30:09] their backslidden they don't know what
[1:30:10] they're doing and they're the next
[1:30:13] casual in war that's what we saw how
[1:30:22] look what the Bible says here John the
[1:30:24] disciple that Jesus loved little
[1:30:30] children he said let no man deceive you
[1:30:32] he that doeth righteousness is righteous
[1:30:35] even as he is righteous he that
[1:30:39] committeth sin is of the devil and the
[1:30:41] devil sinneth from the beginning for
[1:30:43] this purpose the Son of God was
[1:30:44] manifested he might destroy the works of
[1:30:45] the devil whosoever is born of God does
[1:30:47] not commit sin for his seed remaineth in
[1:30:51] him and he cannot sin because he was
[1:30:53] born of God that's the Baptist the Holy
[1:30:54] Ghost in this he says the children of
[1:30:58] God are manifest and the children of the
[1:31:02] devil by what by words no he says by
[1:31:05] manifestation in outward the words comes
[1:31:09] second the deeds came first the doctrine
[1:31:12] came second he says whosoever does not
[1:31:15] righteous is not of God neither he that
[1:31:19] loveth not his brother so what is the
[1:31:23] message for this is the message that you
[1:31:28] have learned from the beginning that we
[1:31:30] should love one another
[1:31:35] there's probably not two ministers in
[1:31:38] this message that have a hundred percent
[1:31:40] ingredients on everything but I notice
[1:31:46] how some will look past others
[1:31:48] differences in as soon as another one
[1:31:50] has a different difference they'll run
[1:31:52] them out it's picking and choosing not
[1:31:57] as Cain who's of the wicked one and slew
[1:31:59] his brother slew him naturally now and I
[1:32:05] talked to this brother he said brother
[1:32:07] he goes it's like I was a spiritual
[1:32:09] martyr he said these I'm not go any
[1:32:14] further than that I would say something
[1:32:16] but and we're forced through him because
[1:32:19] his all works were evil and his brothers
[1:32:21] righteous Marvel not my brethren if the
[1:32:23] world hates you he said we know he had
[1:32:26] passed from death to life because we
[1:32:28] love the Brethren hey if I started
[1:32:32] preaching Trinity doctrine I believe my
[1:32:37] brother Jesse right there our pastor
[1:32:38] would not hate me and call me a devil
[1:32:42] he'd say what do you know you know
[1:32:44] what'd he do
[1:32:45] he'd have to be him he'd be right here
[1:32:47] on the altar with his children praying
[1:32:48] for me I'm sure he would call me and
[1:32:53] check up on me and try and he would try
[1:32:56] and try and win me back to the word he'd
[1:32:59] probably even make a personal visit to
[1:33:01] my house and say brother can we talk
[1:33:05] about this one more time and if I'm in a
[1:33:08] real to confused state I probably yeah
[1:33:09] let's look I I I'm starting to see this
[1:33:12] now and just you probably sit me down
[1:33:14] and run the scripture with me into a
[1:33:16] Bible study because that's what brothers
[1:33:19] do we're our brothers and sisters
[1:33:22] keepers where we keep one another Marvel
[1:33:27] not my brethren that the world hate you
[1:33:28] know that we have passed from death to
[1:33:29] life whosoever hates that brother is a
[1:33:32] murderer and he know not that no
[1:33:35] murderer hath eternal life abiding in
[1:33:37] him hereby perceive we the love of God
[1:33:40] because he laid down the love of God
[1:33:42] what is the love of God because he laid
[1:33:46] down his life for us
[1:33:48] did he throw andra did he throw us under
[1:33:51] the bus and just keep back and forth
[1:33:53] back and forth no he gave his life for
[1:33:55] us and we ought to lay down our lives
[1:33:58] for the Brethren but it seems like it
[1:34:01] doesn't happen too much but who was
[1:34:05] there anywhere so ever hath this world's
[1:34:07] good world's good and seeth his brother
[1:34:09] in need and shutteth up his bowels of
[1:34:11] compassion from he where how do out the
[1:34:13] love of God and here my little children
[1:34:14] let let us not love in Word neither in
[1:34:18] tongue but in deed and in truth the
[1:34:22] first person to blast this brother down
[1:34:25] south had texted him the night before it
[1:34:27] said brother I love you I appreciate you
[1:34:29] I respect you more than I ever had
[1:34:30] before in my entire life after this
[1:34:32] conversation and then one day he had a
[1:34:35] whatsapp message that just destroyed him
[1:34:38] he said brother I'll send you the text
[1:34:40] if you want I'll send it to you I can
[1:34:41] take a screenshot and send it to you and
[1:34:43] show you I was like no I believe your
[1:34:44] brother what was said one thing to his
[1:34:48] face and he thought he was leaving to go
[1:34:52] overseas and he blasts him somewhere
[1:34:53] else in the greatest message in those
[1:35:02] who say they have divine love one for
[1:35:04] another and this is his commandment that
[1:35:09] we should believe on his name on his
[1:35:11] name son on the name of his son Jesus
[1:35:14] Christ and love one another and he gave
[1:35:15] us as he gave us commandment that was
[1:35:20] the commandment is to love one another
[1:35:22] this is commanded to love one this is
[1:35:24] not an option we do this this is real
[1:35:28] love this is life if we're to live in
[1:35:33] the world and this is the word this is
[1:35:34] the commandment that says this is to be
[1:35:36] done if we fail it then we have sinned I
[1:35:38] wonder how many would repent of this is
[1:35:43] it well I might little drop a little
[1:35:44] something in here Matthew 24 in the last
[1:35:47] days the two spirits we so close
[1:35:48] together to see the real active as
[1:35:49] possible now that's just like looking at
[1:35:52] the right hand and the left hand they
[1:35:55] both got thumbs fingers nails small
[1:35:58] fingers middle fingers so forth index
[1:36:00] fingers all these different fingers
[1:36:02] they both have blueprints only one turn
[1:36:05] this way
[1:36:06] and the other that way both the same
[1:36:09] print made the same way the thumb prints
[1:36:12] everything is identical alike the only
[1:36:15] difference is the characteristic of it
[1:36:19] one is left and one is right that's the
[1:36:24] only difference any ties in Mathew 24:24
[1:36:31] the only difference is their
[1:36:36] characteristics their deeds and that's
[1:36:41] just the way the spirits will be in the
[1:36:43] last day they will be the characteristic
[1:36:45] of it will detect whether is of God or
[1:36:47] not one of them will be right and the
[1:36:51] other will be wrong you'll know it by
[1:36:52] the characteristic of God but God laid
[1:36:56] his loved us so much he laid his life
[1:36:58] down for us he took our sin he took our
[1:37:04] blame he took our approach our
[1:37:08] iniquities how much should we lay down
[1:37:10] for our brothers and sisters a man just
[1:37:14] perfectly will have to be that way but
[1:37:17] the right hand we'd say is right and the
[1:37:18] left is wrong or see vice-versa one of
[1:37:20] them they're determined by their
[1:37:21] characteristics only Canole by their
[1:37:23] characteristics
[1:37:27] I've always wonder about the scripture
[1:37:29] until I find I found the interpretation
[1:37:32] in the Bible I've always wondered about
[1:37:35] this won't to them they have gone in the
[1:37:38] way of Cain they have ran greedily after
[1:37:39] the error of Balaam for reward and
[1:37:41] perished in the gainsaying of core there
[1:37:44] are spots in your feasts of charity when
[1:37:46] they feast with you feeding themselves
[1:37:47] without fear clouds they are without
[1:37:50] water carried about of winds what does
[1:37:55] that mean I've always wondered until it
[1:37:57] was probably just a couple months ago I
[1:37:58] found that scripture here in Proverbs 25
[1:38:01] 14 whosoever boasts in the self of a
[1:38:04] false gift is like clouds and rain and
[1:38:06] water without or wind without rain hmm
[1:38:10] well I'm a pastor and this and this yeah
[1:38:13] but is that you have the true gift are
[1:38:15] you left-handed
[1:38:16] to our right hand and pastor gotta be
[1:38:20] careful hey Matt now we're almost to an
[1:38:24] hour here I won't be much longer by
[1:38:26] God's grace look at this now your people
[1:38:29] with those salt ember salt blade tempers
[1:38:32] that's always spouting off in the mouth
[1:38:34] that somebody can't put up the things
[1:38:35] like that be careful you're guilty if
[1:38:38] you speak one word against your brother
[1:38:39] that's not right I wonder how many call
[1:38:43] I'm gonna called personally called that
[1:38:44] brother that made one of the messages or
[1:38:46] them letters and texts letters I guess
[1:38:52] your brother's not right just go around
[1:38:54] go around and tear it down you don't
[1:38:56] have to have a stick a knife a man to
[1:38:59] Madison and a man's back to kill him
[1:39:01] you can break his character and kill him
[1:39:03] kill his influence speak against your
[1:39:06] pastor here say something bad about and
[1:39:08] he just might as well as shot him told
[1:39:11] something that wasn't right about him
[1:39:13] well you it'll kill his influence with
[1:39:15] the pill people and things like that and
[1:39:17] you're guilty of it what Jesus said Wow
[1:39:21] such a matter such a fire this little
[1:39:23] member can can boast can start and one
[1:39:31] of the very one of the very first signs
[1:39:33] of Christianity refused to kill a man
[1:39:36] remember that story brother Graham
[1:39:37] thought he said he's sitting with his
[1:39:39] daughter and she had this book or
[1:39:40] whatever on the gladiator and a
[1:39:42] Christian man was was taken as a
[1:39:44] Christian by Rome or one of the in they
[1:39:46] they made him fight as a gladiator but
[1:39:48] he's a Christian he's a real Christian
[1:39:50] and they he was in the midst of the
[1:39:51] arena there and he given one sword and
[1:39:53] the Christians like what do I do out you
[1:39:55] know and and they release a lion and the
[1:39:58] Christian had the defendant self he
[1:39:59] killed a lion and there were people
[1:40:00] going roaring just praised or not pretty
[1:40:03] I was just well awesome fight awesome
[1:40:05] fighting they released another lion and
[1:40:07] the Christians slew that one as well
[1:40:10] the crowd went wild Emperor was up on
[1:40:13] his feet what they do next
[1:40:18] they released a man an African warrior a
[1:40:21] pagan warrior and the Christian looks up
[1:40:25] the Emperor Emperor an emperors like
[1:40:29] kill him the Christian fought the man
[1:40:33] and pushed him down and could have taken
[1:40:37] his life but it came to his senses that
[1:40:40] he was a Christian he put the sword in
[1:40:43] the ground and took off his armor went
[1:40:44] to the end person I cannot kill a man
[1:40:46] I'm a Christian never yelled down you
[1:40:49] refuse the Emperor and the Emperor
[1:40:52] yelled out to the African man's and you
[1:40:54] get up take that sword and slew him
[1:40:56] through and the Christian man went like
[1:40:57] this and allowed him to kill him right
[1:40:59] through he said that's right and you
[1:41:04] could kill him more ways than just
[1:41:05] sticking him with the knife speak
[1:41:06] against his character many ways you can
[1:41:09] do it Jesus but the first sign of a
[1:41:11] Christian is you'll not kill someone
[1:41:13] with your words god help us now another
[1:41:27] reason hero of this the silence in
[1:41:30] heaven and God has to keep things I'm
[1:41:33] sure brother Jesse taught us many many
[1:41:34] times and been very very thorough he's
[1:41:36] very thorough on everything he does
[1:41:38] teaching preaching all those things now
[1:41:42] this is dealing with the the Seventh
[1:41:43] Seal itself the silence why what what is
[1:41:46] it now none of us know but I'm going to
[1:41:48] tell you in my revelation of it and now
[1:41:51] I'm not prone to be fanatic as if I am
[1:41:53] I'm ignorant of intime not guilty to his
[1:41:56] imagination things or however and he
[1:41:59] goes on he says and now as soon as I
[1:42:00] stand on this platform tonight I had a
[1:42:02] revelation that had the revelation that
[1:42:04] revealed it's a three-fold manner right
[1:42:06] he said that I will go and speak to you
[1:42:08] by God's God's help the fold of it he
[1:42:11] says those seven thunders that he heard
[1:42:13] their thunder was forbidden right and
[1:42:14] that's what the mystery is laying behind
[1:42:16] those seven consecutive thunders rolling
[1:42:18] out now why let's prove it why it says
[1:42:22] it is the secret that no one knows about
[1:42:25] John was forbidding to write about it
[1:42:28] even right a symbol of why this is why
[1:42:30] there was no activity in heaven
[1:42:32] it might give away the secret do you see
[1:42:34] it now so he was keeping God kept
[1:42:39] silence because whatever action whatever
[1:42:42] whatever would have been shown up there
[1:42:43] would have revealed the last mystery the
[1:42:46] last revelation the last thing there was
[1:42:50] things that we need to know then heavens
[1:42:53] could not write that heavens can't know
[1:42:55] about nothing else because there was
[1:42:56] nothing else to go on it was a relaxing
[1:42:58] time God was silent and now he sits back
[1:43:04] he had done so much work for the last
[1:43:06] what twenty years to the prophets
[1:43:07] ministry through all this mystery the
[1:43:09] East says now it's a relaxing time he
[1:43:11] kicks back he's brought forth restored
[1:43:14] the word and now he's letting people do
[1:43:16] what they want to do with it all the
[1:43:19] while God has one little revelation here
[1:43:22] waiting a 3-fold I was like this
[1:43:24] revelation that he is going to speak at
[1:43:27] it momentarily when these days soon here
[1:43:29] and then he'll be on but it but it will
[1:43:32] reveal many things now why I've seen
[1:43:37] could get a hold of it you might do
[1:43:38] great damage there is one thing he don't
[1:43:40] know now we can interpret anything he
[1:43:41] wants to interpret any kind of gift I
[1:43:43] hope you're learning but he can't know
[1:43:45] this is not even in the word it's a
[1:43:46] total secret man right and that's
[1:43:51] exactly about as far as we can go right
[1:43:52] there now look what he says here
[1:43:56] remember it was Jesus when his enemies
[1:43:58] thought that they had defeated him the
[1:44:00] unbeliever said we got him on the cross
[1:44:03] the savages Pharisees the religious
[1:44:05] leaders of the day who hated him and
[1:44:06] hung him in the cross they thought we
[1:44:08] got him now aha it was about that time
[1:44:10] God wrote in on the scene raised him up
[1:44:13] on Easter morning broke the King to the
[1:44:14] Satan stripped hell took the keys of
[1:44:17] death hell and rose up with them sure it
[1:44:19] was just at that week time his message
[1:44:22] he had preached the word it stood by and
[1:44:25] everything and then it was at that real
[1:44:26] weak moment when he when that's when he
[1:44:29] when the victory come right now the
[1:44:32] message is at a weak moment I talked
[1:44:36] with the brother and what'd he say he
[1:44:38] said brother if we don't find some
[1:44:39] answers on these things he said 20 years
[1:44:41] from now there will be no message
[1:44:44] they said that's how many discrepancies
[1:44:46] how many things that you know however I
[1:44:48] believe you put your pastor our pastor
[1:44:50] brother Jesse here has answered many of
[1:44:52] those but many are not gonna be able to
[1:44:55] see his his his videos he says now when
[1:44:59] he'd done all he could dude and God came
[1:45:01] in he changed the scene when Jesus had
[1:45:08] recovered from the shock of death he was
[1:45:09] the strongest he could walk through the
[1:45:11] building without even a moving of a
[1:45:13] mortar of a stone he could eat fish and
[1:45:15] bread amen yes it was at that time after
[1:45:18] the weakness had come that he found
[1:45:19] himself strong it was after weakness had
[1:45:21] come so we're seeing saints of God we're
[1:45:24] at we're at a weak point silence had
[1:45:28] happened Nicollet ISM lack of zeal like
[1:45:32] a fervor in the church lack of fire
[1:45:35] almost a lukewarm state for the bride my
[1:45:37] goodness I don't pray like I should I
[1:45:40] taught on the the part about the cans
[1:45:44] were dealing with the approaches of war
[1:45:45] I'm sorry the approaches of worship one
[1:45:48] of them is to God says to get in your
[1:45:51] closet he says get up early and then he
[1:45:53] says what seek my face a lot of times I
[1:45:57] would get up early and I prayed but I
[1:45:59] never ever hardly ever sought his face
[1:46:01] until he was there there are things we
[1:46:05] have to do and it looks like it's pretty
[1:46:08] weak now for both message and messenger
[1:46:12] and if this is not come to pass but
[1:46:16] don't you worry somewhere I don't know
[1:46:19] how but I'm trusting him he'll come
[1:46:21] riding in on the scene someday don't you
[1:46:24] worry let's go out together let's bow
[1:46:27] our heads together amen
[1:46:28] eating time evangelism so stand my point
[1:46:36] the whole point of this was to show that
[1:46:39] while God is being absolutely silent
[1:46:41] right now as far as there's no judgment
[1:46:47] striking do we hear answers prayers
[1:46:52] absolutely do we save healings and and
[1:46:54] those sort of things absolutely but as
[1:46:56] far as to hear
[1:46:58] the the Spirit of God speak to wreck
[1:47:01] like outside of preaching outside you
[1:47:03] know I mean we we want we desire more
[1:47:05] awesome I desire to hear God more but as
[1:47:09] he's allowed this time where he is just
[1:47:11] up at his place as the Bible would say
[1:47:16] Satan has let people come into this
[1:47:19] message and just ravish it leaving the
[1:47:22] people powerless more fighting and
[1:47:26] bickering quarreling argument arguing
[1:47:30] hatred all those things have totally
[1:47:36] encompassed the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:47:39] where's the divine love brother goes my
[1:47:43] church and visit another church he said
[1:47:44] brother he was not one person's in hello
[1:47:45] to me
[1:47:47] he was brother it's ice down there at
[1:47:50] one hmm let's bow our heads your healing
[1:47:56] father Lord Jesus so we love thee God
[1:47:58] you know Jesus Lord even though you said
[1:48:02] in your word God then the seventh seal
[1:48:05] Lord of this you were silent for half an
[1:48:07] hour Lord and we don't know how that is
[1:48:09] on an earthly time but Lord we know
[1:48:13] we're growing close Scott we see
[1:48:15] everything enough world right now Lord a
[1:48:18] little tiny diseased God
[1:48:21] nothing like a Zechariah 14 God is even
[1:48:24] struck
[1:48:25] the Bible said eyes the men will ride
[1:48:27] out and the tongues will ride out the
[1:48:29] flesh will be just falling off and death
[1:48:31] will flee from them we're not talking
[1:48:34] about this kind of plague or just a
[1:48:36] little simple virus God and lore that's
[1:48:39] shaken the entire world Lord Lord me we
[1:48:44] know you're prepping God Lord
[1:48:46] we're not shaking nor we're not just
[1:48:49] made or tossed to and fro Lord Jesus
[1:48:50] over leaving you I know we know the time
[1:48:54] of science is coming over you're going
[1:48:55] to bring forth its thunders Lord you're
[1:48:57] going to reveal Lord exactly what you've
[1:48:59] kept hidden for 2,000 years Lord John
[1:49:02] was about to write back to 98d John Rose
[1:49:05] grabbed that quill that spiritual quill
[1:49:07] or whatever kind of pen he had Lord he
[1:49:10] is riding on that scroll daughter on
[1:49:11] that paper and you told her to hold it
[1:49:14] up you know Jesus but we know those
[1:49:16] things you real very soon but we just
[1:49:19] pray Lord and you just anoint Lord
[1:49:21] whatever it is God no to finish the work
[1:49:23] God said you would but Lord at that time
[1:49:26] that also be persecution the bride Lord
[1:49:28] she'd have enemies Lord he would be
[1:49:31] killing your spiritual God and though
[1:49:34] Jesus would even though he may not have
[1:49:35] a martyr's crown or gonna be persecuted
[1:49:37] order give us all strength give us that
[1:49:40] backbone God we would fear man the
[1:49:44] diamond ago we fear you were walking
[1:49:46] reverence humility God you're holding
[1:49:50] here worthy word alone God Lord wanting
[1:49:53] to hear your spirit God Lord speak back
[1:49:56] to your daughters we have many words
[1:49:57] just love this rattle or a heart soft
[1:50:00] floor but all we want to hear you sleep
[1:50:02] on time as it changed ephram's heart
[1:50:06] Lord HP jars as well not let go of
[1:50:09] everything but all material goods will
[1:50:11] be nothing just your spiritual Kingdom
[1:50:14] over
[1:50:14] treasures in heaven bless those because
[1:50:17] they sat through a little teaching here
[1:50:19] God and Lord I wasn't trying to be angry
[1:50:21] or or point fingers going but I Lord
[1:50:24] we're just identifying a spirit dog
[1:50:27] an evil spirit on when one that hates
[1:50:29] his brother and wouldn't stick up before
[1:50:32] and more dissonant well God have mercy
[1:50:35] on holding you just fix whatever needs
[1:50:38] fixing up we love you so sure the name
[1:50:41] of Jesus Christ amen
[1:50:45] brothers sisters I hoped I was alright
[1:50:47] and wanted uh we wanted to hit that
[1:50:49] thoroughly because this we're dealing
[1:50:53] with the statue of perfect man's the
[1:50:54] highest one is to probably kindness
[1:50:57] brotherly kindness yes just being kind
[1:51:01] with God's kindness you know with godly
[1:51:05] love someone could actually take you out
[1:51:09] falsely accuse you take you to a
[1:51:12] whooping stone take those nine cat tails
[1:51:14] and whip your bag see your see your ribs
[1:51:18] your bones will stare at you beat you
[1:51:21] unrecognizably ripped the beard hairs
[1:51:23] out of your face make you walk and carry
[1:51:27] a cross he couldn't carry it no more and
[1:51:30] hang you on the cross and brotherly
[1:51:32] kindness as Lord Father forgive them for
[1:51:35] they know not what they do that is the
[1:51:39] characteristic of God that's the
[1:51:43] characteristic we want in our lives when
[1:51:46] I hear about maybe the problem you're
[1:51:47] having whatever whatever it's not them
[1:51:51] it's the Spirit we know that's just this
[1:51:54] pure because you know deep down every
[1:51:56] person wants it reality wants to be good
[1:51:59] when that when a baby is born that baby
[1:52:02] is happy but if they grow up in the
[1:52:05] wrong environment it twists their
[1:52:08] character you take a tree and you plant
[1:52:11] that tree in the forest and you let that
[1:52:13] sapling come up and it's just kicking
[1:52:15] out little limbs here and there and a
[1:52:16] flower here there a leaf here however
[1:52:20] and maybe get its first fruit and some
[1:52:22] evil man come around and bend that tree
[1:52:24] down and place something over it and
[1:52:26] that tree will have a permanent Bend if
[1:52:28] left alone it'll be this it'll distort
[1:52:31] them it'll pervert them for the rest of
[1:52:33] their days if you look at the Prophet
[1:52:37] when he's going into discernment he
[1:52:39] whenever he goes back in time he finds
[1:52:41] there was something that caused them to
[1:52:43] be like that and once that problem is
[1:52:47] identified the situation sold I don't
[1:52:51] know what it does I just you just have
[1:52:53] that that calming peace it just gives
