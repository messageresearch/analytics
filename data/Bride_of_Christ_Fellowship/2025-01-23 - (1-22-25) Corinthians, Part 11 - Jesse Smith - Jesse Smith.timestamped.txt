[16:22] said amen let's take our Bibles here

[16:27] we'll just read verse one
[16:34] 1 Corinthians 71 here by God's
[16:39] grace I think we're on part 11 if I'm
[16:42] not mistaken uh by the grace of the
[16:45] Lord what's the uh the title for Book of
[16:49] Corinthians part 11 that's my simple
[16:51] little title there by God's gra So
[16:53] lately well I guess over the past five
[16:55] or six years I've been going through
[16:56] entire books of the Bible and preaching
[16:57] every verse
[16:59] so yeah we're just looking at the book
[17:01] of Corinthians this one deals mostly
[17:02] with um marriage and Divorce by God's
[17:05] grace First Corinthians uh chapter seven
[17:08] does okay yeah so I I'll go back here
[17:11] brother in just a moment and these are
[17:12] the these are the main topics the whole
[17:14] book deals with right now we're on part
[17:15] four sanctity of the body and marriage
[17:19] so tonight we're looking at marriage by
[17:21] God's grace yeah all right so uh 1
[17:23] Corinthians 71 hope you got your Bibles
[17:25] there at home by God's grace uh for the
[17:28] live streamers
[17:30] so we'll read this here on three if we
[17:31] can ready one two three now concerning
[17:34] the things whereof you wrote unto me it
[17:38] is good for a man not to touch a woman
[17:41] may God add His blessings to his word so
[17:43] we're going to uh preach chapter 7
[17:45] hopefully we'll see how far we get
[17:47] through it let me set a timer
[17:53] here uh we're looking here uh back on
[17:55] this Corinthians series uh we're looking
[17:58] at chapter 7 now there's two main
[17:59] subjects for chapter 7 the first nine
[18:01] verses are the sanctity or sacredness of
[18:04] marriage uh and that's because God has
[18:06] established marriage and then verses 10
[18:09] through 40 it's the more lengthly part
[18:11] that's the regulation or rule of
[18:13] marriage among Gentile Believers and
[18:16] it's just a beautiful chapter we're
[18:17] going to see how Paul gives us thus sayi
[18:19] the Lord at times and then he spends
[18:20] actually a large part of this chapter
[18:22] just giving his best judgment and he
[18:24] tell he tells the people this isn't from
[18:26] the Lord this is my judgment he says but
[18:29] I think I have the spirit of God so we
[18:31] get a lot of wisdom from Paul and
[18:34] understand this to be the sacred
[18:35] scripture uh we're in the this the
[18:37] fourth part of the entire uh group or or
[18:41] series here of the book we looked at the
[18:43] introduction we looked at the carnal
[18:45] divided condition of the church uh
[18:47] chapters 1 through four and then we
[18:49] dealt with sexual immorality in chapter
[18:51] five in the beginning of chapter six we
[18:53] looked at the S the sanctity of the body
[18:55] a few weeks ago when we were preaching
[18:56] on this uh to finish chapter 6 tonight
[18:59] is all about marriage uh it's the entire
[19:01] chapter of chapter
[19:03] 7even so uh that's kind of what the
[19:05] first seven chapters are about okay so
[19:09] uh verse one says what we read earlier
[19:11] uh now concerning the things whereof you
[19:13] wrote unto me so we know the the the
[19:15] Believers in Corinth perhaps the house
[19:17] of Khloe we learned in chapter one
[19:19] because the house of Khloe reported to
[19:21] Paul that there was a lot of Divisions
[19:22] in the church um but part of the letter
[19:26] perhaps it came from the house of Khloe
[19:27] we don't know but the some of the
[19:28] Believers in Corinth wrote a letter to
[19:30] Paul and one of the questions was on um
[19:34] celibacy uh and so some of the Believers
[19:36] in Corinth were saying it's good for a
[19:38] man not to touch a woman so they were
[19:40] speaking of uh you know they were trying
[19:43] to influence Believers in the church
[19:44] just to be celibate uh but you got to be
[19:47] careful with that because as Paul's
[19:48] going to say later U it takes a gift of
[19:51] God to be single not just anybody I mean
[19:54] people can try to be single but they'll
[19:55] have a great battle unless they have um
[19:58] a gift to be single so it's very
[20:00] important as Paul will get to in a
[20:02] little bit uh Paul says you know that's
[20:03] the gift that I have he said I wish all
[20:05] men were as me well that if that was the
[20:08] case then there'd be no children there'd
[20:09] be no little children to raise up you
[20:11] know in little families and Christian
[20:12] churches there'd be no children's
[20:13] ministry there be no children's uh
[20:16] Ministry or questions or anything like
[20:18] that so but that's Paul's heart you know
[20:20] Paul's heart was to see everybody give
[20:23] God all their service all their life uh
[20:26] so uh you know i' I heard some um
[20:30] history on this and and there was some
[20:32] history on this that said there was over
[20:34] a thousand prostitutes in Corinth and
[20:36] they just roam the streets and so uh you
[20:39] know when these Believers when these
[20:41] people became Believers know beforehand
[20:44] we saw in chapter six a lot of them were
[20:46] fornicators adulterers
[20:48] homosexual um there were so many sins
[20:51] and so when they came to Christ no
[20:53] wonder a lot of them are like hey we we
[20:55] should just be celibate you know not get
[20:57] married we just we got to be so far out
[21:00] of that uh culture because the culture
[21:02] was just saturated with sexuality well
[21:03] that's exactly what we got today uh I
[21:06] mean I would say a lot of women are
[21:08] spiritual prostitutes or at least uh
[21:10] naturally loose and fornicators
[21:12] adulterers you know the there's a lot of
[21:14] sexual immorality in the world today
[21:16] very similar um but so this this seems
[21:19] to be a reason why a lot of the
[21:21] Corinthians well we're Believers
[21:22] remember they got they got gifts all the
[21:24] time they got tongues interpretation
[21:25] prophecy the spirit of God is moving in
[21:28] but it's not necessarily moving in love
[21:30] for the people that's why Paul's got to
[21:32] you know correct them on love but so we
[21:34] can see why some of the people would say
[21:36] oh don't touch a woman ever you know
[21:38] just be celibate so they wrote Paul
[21:40] about that and so Paul's answer was uh
[21:43] you know that's what you're telling me
[21:44] in the letter but nevertheless or but or
[21:46] yet to avoid
[21:48] fornication let every man have his own
[21:50] wife so fornication is any sexual out
[21:53] sexual uh activity before marriage
[21:55] before you promis to marry the person so
[21:57] Paul said to avoid this let every man
[22:00] have his own wife and every woman have
[22:02] her own husband so this every everyone
[22:05] must mean anyone who wants to be married
[22:06] because later Paul will speak and talk
[22:09] about the gift of singleness and his its
[22:11] benefits right so uh Paul says let's uh
[22:16] for those people that are going to want
[22:17] to be married uh get married because if
[22:20] not he says later you're going to burn
[22:22] with fire fiery passions now verse three
[22:25] said let the husband render under his
[22:26] wife due benevolence that means good
[22:28] willll do um and likewise also the wife
[22:31] unto the
[22:32] husband okay so let me see if I got any
[22:34] other notes on that yeah for the wife
[22:36] hath not power or authority over her own
[22:38] body but the husband and likewise also
[22:40] the husband hath not power over his own
[22:43] body but the wife so when a couple gets
[22:45] married they have to understand my body
[22:46] just doesn't belong to me anymore it
[22:48] also belongs to my wife or the wife
[22:50] would say my my body belongs to my
[22:52] husband and so I've got to have Goodwill
[22:53] I've got to think about you know when
[22:55] they want to have relations I have to
[22:57] give myself over to that even if I don't
[22:59] feel like it uh now of course it's not
[23:02] anything with violence you never
[23:03] violence or forcefully or anything like
[23:05] that it's good will like he said do
[23:07] benevolence that's benevolence is love
[23:09] this this good will uh love so that's
[23:13] expressed between husbands and wife um
[23:15] because the B the Bible says when you're
[23:17] married you're one flesh right uh and
[23:20] the husband's wife belongs to the I'm
[23:22] sorry the husband's body belongs to the
[23:23] wife and wife the
[23:25] husband because he says it right there
[23:27] the husband hath not power over his own
[23:29] body but the wife and Paul says in the
[23:31] next verse verse five defraud ye not one
[23:34] another so I think I mentioned this a
[23:35] few weeks ago um where the word defraud
[23:39] means Rob so if a husband would not uh
[23:42] have relations with his wife on purpose
[23:44] he's robbing her of that and same way
[23:47] for the the wife uh refusing her husband
[23:50] uh they're actually robbing each other
[23:52] of that need and that due benevolence uh
[23:56] that Good Will and the love one for
[23:58] another
[23:59] except it be consent for a time so the
[24:02] only reason a couple should not want to
[24:04] come together is if they're going to
[24:05] agree to fast and pray as we see there
[24:08] in verse five uh but then after fasting
[24:11] and praying they got to come back
[24:12] together or else Satan will tempt them
[24:14] for their lack of
[24:16] self-control uh because of all the of
[24:18] course the Temptations of Corinth and
[24:19] even of course modern day Le oysa uh
[24:22] Satan's so that proves Satan's going to
[24:24] come and and even after you get married
[24:26] you're going to be tempted by the devil
[24:28] uh right with all these other passions
[24:30] and all these things so we see it right
[24:31] there a lack of
[24:32] self-control um so the enemy is just so
[24:35] wicked the enemy is not going to give up
[24:36] on you brother Ram says once uh once you
[24:39] say you got the Holy Ghost Satan points
[24:40] all of his guns at you to try to tempt
[24:42] you and so this is one of those cases uh
[24:45] where Paul says even in a marriage you
[24:47] know if you're not uh having the coming
[24:49] together relation time uh for prayer and
[24:51] fasting that's fine but as soon as
[24:53] that's over come together because
[24:54] Satan's going to try to tempt you in
[24:56] that error Satan's going to try to get
[24:57] people to adultery is what this is
[24:59] saying so come together uh shortly there
[25:03] soon thereafter the prayer and fasting
[25:04] time now verse six is a very interesting
[25:07] verse so let's look at this but I speak
[25:08] this by permission and not of
[25:10] commandment so there's a few different
[25:12] uh ideas here's the first one Paul's
[25:14] letters were considered scripture
[25:15] remember uh 2 Peter 3:16 Peter says you
[25:19] know some of Paul's letters are hard to
[25:20] understand but they're scripture and he
[25:22] said evil men twist them or arest them
[25:24] to their own destruction so people
[25:26] recognize Paul was writing the scripture
[25:28] um and yet sometimes he would pinpoint
[25:30] and this is the best part about Paul he
[25:32] would pinpoint specific times he was
[25:34] giving his own human judgment um that
[25:37] wasn't from the Lord uh but he still
[25:39] believed he was inspired by the spirit
[25:41] of God giving his wisdom or his best
[25:43] judgment in a situation so an example is
[25:45] like in verse 40 uh but she's happier if
[25:48] she so abide after my judgment and I
[25:51] think also that I have the spirit of God
[25:52] so Paul's saying you know this woman can
[25:54] get married but she'd be probably
[25:56] happier if she stays single based upon
[25:58] my judgment right because I have the
[26:00] spirit of God I met Jesus Christ right
[26:02] you met Jesus Christ um so that's one
[26:06] thought now here's another thought now
[26:07] this is just my opinion but this is also
[26:08] agrees with some other commentators it
[26:11] seemed like Paul was giving permission
[26:13] for the Corinthians about marriage just
[26:16] regarding verse six and the couples
[26:19] using prayer and fasting times to
[26:21] abstain from relations so that that's
[26:23] that's my thought now the commentator is
[26:25] going to give a third thought in the
[26:26] next slide here of the next uh comment
[26:29] that I'm going to preach here by God's
[26:31] grace now the reason I think that is
[26:32] because you don't find that anywhere in
[26:34] the Old Testament as far as I know now
[26:35] somebody could help me out can anybody
[26:37] think of a time in the Old Testament
[26:38] when a couple would fast and pray and
[26:39] then wouldn't have uh the relations I
[26:42] can't think of one I couldn't think of
[26:44] one um so I I couldn't think of one so
[26:47] that's why I think Paul was just
[26:48] speaking of permission just on verse six
[26:51] there I'm sorry verse five rather with
[26:53] uh prayer and fasting times where
[26:55] couples don't have
[26:56] relations now I think verses 2 three
[27:00] four and five um I'm sorry 2 three and
[27:03] four I sorry I got the wrong number
[27:05] there 2 three and four seem like their
[27:06] Divine commands found in other
[27:08] scriptures because Hosea 3:3 is where
[27:11] Hosea rescues and he buys his prostitute
[27:15] wife out of the slave market and he says
[27:18] now you're going to be faithful to me
[27:20] and I'm also going to be for thee so we
[27:23] have this idea of how the husband's wife
[27:26] I'm sorry the husband's bodies for the
[27:27] wife the wife's bodies for the husband
[27:29] we see that previously in the scripture
[27:31] so I think I think uh the verses 2 three
[27:34] and four were actually commands from God
[27:37] but then Paul says by permission he's
[27:39] giving permission for times of prayer
[27:41] and fasting not to come together
[27:42] separate and then after words come back
[27:45] together so Satan doesn't tempt now
[27:46] that's just my own thought okay I could
[27:48] be wrong on that that's my own thought
[27:50] but here's the third thought the third
[27:51] thought is uh the commentators thought
[27:53] maybe verse six where Paul's saying I'm
[27:55] speaking by permission not of
[27:57] commandment was him referring to the
[27:59] Future verses where Paul's going to
[28:00] share what he would recommend like in
[28:02] verse 7 he said for I would that all men
[28:05] were as myself all men so Paul's giving
[28:08] his his his opinion I wish all men were
[28:10] like me of course we know not all men
[28:13] have that gift right no one there's not
[28:15] all men who have the same gift of the
[28:16] nine gifts of the holy spirit or in this
[28:18] case even the gift of
[28:20] singleness so some people think verse
[28:23] six where Paul's saying I'm speaking
[28:24] this by permission is speaking to the
[28:27] later verses and not the previous uh
[28:30] five verses that's a good thought too
[28:32] who I I don't know for sure but we can
[28:34] clearly see in verse 7 and verse say
[28:36] then Paul says I say to the unmarried
[28:38] and the widows so clearly Paul has given
[28:40] his own judgments here based upon his
[28:42] status as an apostle as an a prophet a
[28:44] teacher he was a pastor in Ephesus um he
[28:48] had all five gifts he he did the work of
[28:49] evangelist uh he would go back and visit
[28:51] all the churches they started we saw
[28:53] that in the book of Acts so Paul had all
[28:54] five preaching gifts okay now verse
[28:56] seven for I would that all men were as
[28:58] myself but every man after his proper
[29:00] gift of God one after this manner and
[29:02] another after that so Paul says I wish
[29:04] everybody was single like me but
[29:05] everybody can only do what your gifts
[29:07] allow you to do now remember what a gift
[29:09] is a gift is a Caris it's a it's a
[29:11] charismatic right that's where you get
[29:12] the word gift from charismatic a gift is
[29:15] a special power that you have or ability
[29:17] that you have a special gift of God so
[29:19] Paul says um I wish all men were single
[29:22] but you got to have a gift to do that
[29:24] you have to have power to do that and he
[29:26] says each one has a proper gift or an
[29:28] individual gift um because some people
[29:31] have the the gift of tongues the gift of
[29:33] interpretation um you know all the
[29:35] prophet gifts all these all these gifts
[29:37] teaching preaching you know uh Apostle
[29:39] all these gifts um and he says and each
[29:42] after their own manner right and church
[29:45] you know you as we know you'll find your
[29:46] gift as you're consecrated to God when
[29:48] you're most consecrated to God uh that's
[29:50] when you'll find what your gifts are
[29:53] verse eight I say therefore to the unmar
[29:55] Widow so notice I say not the Lord he's
[29:56] gonna we're going to see that later he
[29:58] always differentiates when it's God and
[30:00] when it's me I say therefore to the
[30:02] unmarried and widows it is good for them
[30:04] if they abide even as I in other words
[30:06] if they stay single but if they cannot
[30:08] contain let them marry for it's better
[30:11] to marry than to burn now this burn word
[30:13] in the Greek means full of fire so a
[30:17] single man that's not married if he has
[30:19] passions on him he feels like he's full
[30:21] of fire like he's got to this Fire's got
[30:23] to be put out and also it can be on a
[30:25] sister too one time I did counseling
[30:27] with a and that's how the sister felt um
[30:30] and I did counseling with her and her
[30:32] husband at the same time over the phone
[30:34] that's why I mentioned that you know I
[30:35] wouldn't counsel an individual sister uh
[30:38] just her have to be with my wife or
[30:40] someone else so in that case it was a
[30:41] couple who Liv many states away I was
[30:44] counseling them over the the phone and
[30:46] that's what the sister was talking about
[30:47] this was one of her uh issues and so you
[30:50] know man or woman can have this burning
[30:52] right we know that that's just part of
[30:53] our human uh human uh buildup or makeup
[30:56] by God's grace but also means uh it's
[30:59] better to marry than to burn it also
[31:01] means to make to glow like a glowing
[31:03] fire or burning with fire so Paul's
[31:06] letting the the people know you know uh
[31:08] if you have this Burning if you have
[31:10] this this glowing with fire this passion
[31:13] to be married uh it's best to get
[31:15] married then so see uh a gift of
[31:18] singleness you won't have that fire you
[31:19] won't have that burning you won't have
[31:21] that full of fire feeling where you're
[31:23] feel like fires of passion I guess we
[31:25] would say it like that um
[31:28] now if you're married though right if if
[31:30] someone's married then if these needs
[31:32] are unmet uh this is what Paul was
[31:34] talking about earlier uh it's like
[31:36] robbing someone from putting out the
[31:38] fire I'm just using metaphor you know
[31:41] for what they're talking about the only
[31:43] way to extinguish that fires have the
[31:44] due benevolence as the good will uh that
[31:47] we talked about
[31:48] earlier um so this is important to
[31:51] recognize especially if someone feels
[31:53] like they might be single I always
[31:54] remember one brother he was a very good
[31:56] brother for years in like I think his
[31:58] into his late 20s he's like he had no
[31:59] desire to be married and all of a sudden
[32:01] overnight it switched he just woke up
[32:03] one morning and he was a preacher he was
[32:05] in the word he studied all the time he
[32:08] preached all the time he was one of the
[32:10] most dedicated Brothers I ever met and
[32:11] he's like oh I don't have any desire to
[32:13] be married and all of a sudden one day
[32:14] it changed just woke up one day and he
[32:17] got married shortly after that and he's
[32:19] happily married now with numerous
[32:20] wonderful children by God's grace I'm
[32:22] not going to name him but my family
[32:23] might know uh verse okay now so now
[32:26] we're done with verses one n we've gone
[32:28] through the sanctity or sacredness of
[32:29] marriage now we're going to get into the
[32:31] regulation or the Rules of Marriage
[32:33] among Believers and some of these are
[32:34] thus sayith the Lord some of these are
[32:36] from your brother Paul our brother Paul
[32:39] by God's grace which we know he had the
[32:40] spirit of God okay so verse 10 now verse
[32:43] 10 and 11 are thus sayith the Lord these
[32:46] are from the Lord okay and these are
[32:49] super important so verse 10 and unto the
[32:51] married I command yet not I but the Lord
[32:54] let not the wife depart from her husband
[32:59] okay so in other words Paul's saying
[33:00] thus sayi the Lord couples should try to
[33:02] stay together as much as possible right
[33:04] because that's what we vow right we vow
[33:06] sickness and in health uh poor Rich
[33:09] right there're supposed to be really if
[33:12] the couple are both serving God and L
[33:13] God there should be no reasons they
[33:15] should separate but of course we know
[33:16] the devil gets in there if people aren't
[33:18] born again or something like that the
[33:19] devil can get in there and there can be
[33:21] awful things happen um but ideally uh
[33:25] God says thus sayith the Lord Stay
[33:27] Together
[33:28] verse 11 but and if she depart let her
[33:31] remain unmarried or be reconciled to her
[33:33] husband and let not the husband put away
[33:35] his wife sorry kind of cold in here
[33:39] um okay so now look at verse 12 now just
[33:42] here's the contrast 10 and 11 are thus
[33:44] sayi the Lord now 12 becomes Paul's
[33:47] suggestions advice wisdom of the holy
[33:50] spirit that he has but he says this is
[33:52] not the Lord but the to the rest speak I
[33:55] not the Lord if any brother hath a wife
[33:57] that believeth not and she be pleased to
[33:59] dwell with him let him not put her away
[34:02] so I just want you to see the contrast
[34:04] between thus sayith the Lord chapter 101
[34:06] and then here's Paul notice he plainly
[34:08] points it out so with any other book now
[34:11] we read from Paul we preached on now you
[34:12] know it Paul will always point it out
[34:14] when he's saying this is me this is not
[34:16] the Lord does that remind you of anybody
[34:18] brother brandom right brother Bram uh
[34:21] brother we just listened to it uh last
[34:23] night he cares you care uh brother Ram
[34:26] thought Martin Luther King Jr would lead
[34:28] millions of people into like a civil war
[34:30] of blacks versus whites and he said he's
[34:31] going to do it he's going to take
[34:33] millions in this millions are going to
[34:34] die in this this this uh this Civil War
[34:38] well they asked brother randam like a
[34:39] couple months later did you prophesy
[34:41] that he said no I don't have nothing on
[34:42] that from the Lord that was just my own
[34:44] human opinion right he said but the way
[34:47] to know he said if it's from God it'll
[34:49] speak it it'll say thus sayith the Lord
[34:51] right so it's a lesson that we know but
[34:53] a lot of people around the message don't
[34:54] necessarily seem to have that
[34:56] understanding which is really sad
[34:57] they'll make every statement brother Ram
[34:58] said thus say the Lord they'll make
[35:00] every future prediction of Prophecy but
[35:02] they don't have this understanding that
[35:03] brother Ram said I've always asked you
[35:05] to be careful how you're listening so
[35:09] that we want to keep that in mind there
[35:10] by God's grace now notice in in verses
[35:13] 10 and 11 couples that separate only
[35:16] have two options they can either remain
[35:18] unmarried or reconcile that's thus say
[35:21] the Lord according to St Paul so couples
[35:24] that separate if they have a living
[35:25] spouse they cannot remarry if they
[35:28] remarry anyone else they're an adulterer
[35:30] and adulterers will not inherit the
[35:32] kingdom of God in other words they won't
[35:33] be baptized with the Holy Ghost if they
[35:35] don't repent of that they'll be lost
[35:37] right because you have to repent of all
[35:38] these things uh adulterers will burn in
[35:40] hell murderers Liars hor mongers uh
[35:43] abominable people they'll all burn in
[35:45] hell so they've got to repent of that
[35:48] adultery now verse 12 but to the rest
[35:51] speak ey not the Lord if any brother
[35:52] hath a wife that believeth not and she
[35:54] be pleased to Joell with him let him not
[35:56] put her away and the woman which hath a
[35:58] husband that believeth not and if he be
[36:01] pleased to dwell with her let her not
[36:03] leave him so if there's couples that
[36:05] one's a Believer one's not a Believer as
[36:08] long as they're it's pleasing to live
[36:09] with each other that's fine Brother mam
[36:11] gives an example 1962 questions and
[36:13] answers he says if the husband doesn't
[36:15] believe and but he says wife it's okay
[36:18] wife you can read your Bible go to
[36:19] church that's fine but I'm that's not
[36:20] for me but I still love you we'll still
[36:22] live together brother Ram said that
[36:23] that's a good example of that they're
[36:24] still pleased to dwell together and it
[36:26] could be vice versa I know up at the
[36:29] well a church up North about an hour
[36:30] north when we when I first came in the
[36:32] message started going there they had a
[36:33] brother there and that the brother was a
[36:35] message believer but his wife just went
[36:37] to maybe a a nominal Church um but they
[36:39] were pleased to dwell together I still
[36:41] believe as far as I know they're married
[36:42] to this day um so that's an example of
[36:46] that verse 14 for the unbelieving
[36:50] husband is Sanctified by the wife and
[36:53] the unbelieving wife is Sanctified by
[36:55] the husband else were your children
[36:56] unclean but now they are holy so uh I
[37:00] want to just say this you know one
[37:01] spouse cannot force his or her family to
[37:04] go through the second stage of Grace so
[37:06] in other words Paul this sanctification
[37:08] Paul's not talking about the second
[37:09] stage of Grace he's just talking about
[37:11] separating from profane
[37:14] things right because like let's say the
[37:16] the wife is a Believer the husband's not
[37:18] well uh the wife's going to say husband
[37:20] you know please don't bring this drugs
[37:21] in or please don't dring the bring these
[37:23] dirty movies in here and hopefully if
[37:25] the husband is has any kindness in his
[37:27] heart and respect for his wife he won't
[37:29] bring it in well that would be a
[37:31] blessing that would mean the wife's life
[37:33] would would keep the the children
[37:35] separate from profane things or she'd
[37:38] say husband please don't cuss you know
[37:40] around the children and if and if he
[37:41] honors that then it's keeping them from
[37:43] hearing profane things so that's what
[37:45] Paul's talking about here it's not that
[37:48] you know we can force our family to go
[37:50] through justification and sanctification
[37:51] we we can't force them it has to be
[37:53] their choice
[37:56] Okay so verse 15 but if the unbelieving
[37:58] depart let him depart a brother or
[38:00] sister is not under bondage in such
[38:02] cases but God has called us to peace now
[38:05] this verse is one of the most
[38:07] misunderstood marriage and divorce
[38:08] scriptures that I've ever seen Satan
[38:11] uses this verse to cause many adulteries
[38:16] so the the carnal mind will look at this
[38:18] and say oh yeah if my spouse isn't a
[38:20] Believer I can leave I can separate from
[38:23] them we can divorce and I can remarry
[38:25] because I'm not under bondage no that's
[38:28] not true uh brother Ram taught
[38:30] specifically on this verse he was
[38:32] specifically asked about this verse 1
[38:34] Corinthians 7:15 and questions and
[38:36] answerers
[38:36] 62 and brother Ram said if you
[38:40] misinterpret 1 Corinthians 7:15 and say
[38:42] you're not under bondage you can remarry
[38:44] then you just contradicted what the Lord
[38:46] said in verses 10 and 11 where you only
[38:48] have two choices and you can't remarry
[38:51] so I hope that's uh understood by God's
[38:53] grace also it contradicts verse 39 so
[38:56] I'm going to read verse 39
[38:58] 1 Corinthians
[39:00] 11:39 so that's very important brother
[39:02] man you know gives numerous examples in
[39:04] that sermon of how the Bible can't
[39:05] contradict itself there's no
[39:07] contradictions brother said I've been
[39:08] preaching three decades and I've never
[39:10] seen one contradiction in the Bible I
[39:12] agree I've been preaching two decades
[39:14] I've never seen one contradiction in the
[39:16] Bible uh verse four verse 39 sorry verse
[39:20] 39 yeah the wife is bound by the law as
[39:24] long as her husband liveth but if her
[39:28] husband be dead she's set at Liberty to
[39:30] be married to whom she will only in the
[39:33] Lord so here Paul twice so it's
[39:34] interesting uh before verse 15 and after
[39:37] verse 15 Paul specifically says there's
[39:40] no remarriage if you separate uh except
[39:43] the death of the husband or death of the
[39:46] wife right if a couple's separated you
[39:47] cannot remarry and it's okay with God
[39:49] it's not okay with God it's adultery uh
[39:52] in the sight of God if you have a living
[39:54] spouse you're divorced from and you go
[39:55] marry a second time that
[39:58] adultery okay so I think that's pretty
[40:00] clear by God's grace um in the Greek
[40:03] bondage means to give oneself holy to
[40:06] one's needs and service to make yourself
[40:09] a bond man to him okay so what Paul is
[40:12] saying if if a couple separates they're
[40:15] no longer under bondage in other words
[40:17] uh the separated spouse isn't under that
[40:19] bondage or
[40:21] Duty um like the duban Elance Command
[40:24] right so if they're separated then
[40:26] they're no longer supposed to come
[40:27] together together to meet each other's
[40:28] needs in that manner they're no longer
[40:30] under that bondage or that that service
[40:33] or that uh due
[40:35] benevolence okay uh and another example
[40:37] the wife's not then obligated to cook
[40:39] and clean for the husband if they're
[40:41] living separate and they're now
[40:42] separated uh they're not they're not
[40:44] under bondage in that case and vice
[40:47] versa okay now of course the man he
[40:49] would be required to pay child support
[40:51] right because he's got to take care of
[40:52] those children so um it's for certain
[40:55] situations within americ relationship
[40:57] they're no longer under bondage but the
[41:00] husband if he has kids will always be
[41:02] required uh to provide for his
[41:05] children okay now here's that I'm just
[41:07] going to do a short version this is
[41:08] actually a pretty long quote it's a
[41:10] pretty great quote if you want to go
[41:11] listen to it but they ask brother
[41:12] brandom um does 1 Corinthians 7:15 mean
[41:16] a sister or brother is free to remarry
[41:19] says no see you don't get his question
[41:22] there and what he's saying they're not
[41:24] free see that would make a contradiction
[41:26] in the scripture and the scriptures
[41:28] doesn't contradict themselves at all
[41:31] okay now I'm going skip
[41:35] ahead now brother R saying if there's a
[41:38] husband a husband and a
[41:39] wife and let's say the woman says to her
[41:42] husband I'm not going to mix up with
[41:43] that bunch of holy rulers I'm not going
[41:45] to do this I'll separate and leave you
[41:47] brother Ram said woman don't leave the
[41:49] church you let the man leave or vice
[41:51] versa so this is how much brother Ram is
[41:54] saying you stay with the church stay
[41:55] with the body of Christ even if you're
[41:57] will leave you don't forsake God's house
[41:59] don't forsake God's word this is how
[42:01] much brother Ram believed in a home
[42:03] church and going to church because in
[42:04] Hebrews 10 right and Jesus example in
[42:06] Luke
[42:07] 4:16 um always support the house of God
[42:11] that's where the spirit of God is poured
[42:12] out Hallelujah that's where you're
[42:14] taught remember in the Old Testament thy
[42:16] way is in the sanctuary God's way you'll
[42:18] find God's way for your life in the
[42:20] sanctuary and then uh brother Ram says a
[42:23] brother or sister is not under bondage
[42:25] in such cases that is if your companion
[42:26] is putting you away and wants to depart
[42:28] for it you don't have to just hold on to
[42:30] them if they're wanting to leave you and
[42:32] they're going to leave you for the cause
[42:33] of Christ let them leave but you can't
[42:35] Remar because God has called us unto
[42:38] peace see but not that you can remarry
[42:41] again he's already stated that right in
[42:42] verses 10 and 11 and also verse 39 but
[42:45] you don't have to live with an
[42:46] unbelieving husband or an unbelieving
[42:48] wife if they're not willing to live with
[42:50] a Christian
[42:51] spouse okay then brother R says now what
[42:53] if you say brother brandom I got married
[42:55] my wife isn't I'm sorry my wife's an
[42:57] unbeliever and here's a sister over here
[42:59] I can marry I'm going to leave this one
[43:00] and marry that one oh no no indeedy your
[43:03] vow is until death you separate and
[43:05] there's nothing else in the world will
[43:07] permit you to marry in the Bible until
[43:09] your companion is dead that's right and
[43:12] that was remember uh chapter 7:39 it's
[43:15] also in uh Romans chapter 7 if I'm not
[43:17] mistaken let me pull that up here
[43:19] briefly by God's
[43:23] grace yeah uh the Bible said in uh
[43:26] Romans 71 and two and three the law hath
[43:29] dominion over a man as long as he liveth
[43:31] the law of
[43:32] marriage for the woman which hath a
[43:34] husband is bound by the law to her
[43:35] husband so long as he liveth but if the
[43:37] husband be dead she's loose from the law
[43:39] of her husband so then if while her
[43:41] husband liveth she be married to another
[43:43] man she should be called an adulteress
[43:46] but if her husband be dead she's free
[43:48] from that law so that she is no
[43:49] adulteress though she be married to
[43:51] another man okay yeah brother Chris okay
[43:55] so say
[43:57] what if um a brother or sister they
[44:00] remarry when their when their ex spouse
[44:04] is still alive and what their spouse
[44:07] what their ex spouse dies while the
[44:10] other person is married is that what
[44:11] they well yeah they're still committing
[44:13] adultery but when that spouse dies what
[44:16] would that be well yeah if they're
[44:18] already living in the second marriage
[44:19] they just should just stay in that and
[44:21] just ask for God's mercy so when brother
[44:23] ran preached marriage and divorce it was
[44:25] February 1965
[44:27] there was a lot of people in his church
[44:28] that were married a second or third time
[44:29] and brother Ram said God what do I tell
[44:31] them do I do they break up their homes
[44:33] and the Holy Spirit said no um give them
[44:36] permission to just live as they are but
[44:38] they better never do that
[44:40] again so they were remarrying even when
[44:44] the the ex spouse was still alive yes so
[44:47] now what the ex spouse died yeah yeah
[44:50] that's what it just came to my head I
[44:52] was like what like the first spouse yeah
[44:54] so what the first spouse dies uh so so
[44:57] say uh yeah so the F the first spouse
[45:01] still alive when the other spouse gets
[45:02] remarried that first spouse dies while
[45:04] the other spouses remarried is that so
[45:07] that would still be fornication or would
[45:09] it be well no longer yeah it it would it
[45:11] would have started as adultery but once
[45:13] they died then they would be free in the
[45:15] sight of God so they they would of
[45:18] course they would repent they would have
[45:19] to repent to God say Lord I'm sorry I
[45:20] was an adulter but then they'd be free
[45:22] right to stay in that marriage the
[45:24] second marriage yeah good question yeah
[45:26] good question
[45:27] all
[45:30] right now um brother R said uh you can't
[45:34] he says oh yeah I'm sorry your vow is he
[45:38] said no anded your vow is until death
[45:40] you separate there's nothing else in the
[45:41] world will permit you to marry in the
[45:43] Bible until your companion is dead right
[45:46] except there's one case we'll talk about
[45:47] that in a little bit there's one case
[45:49] where a man can divorce a wife and uh
[45:52] then remarry but it's very very rare I
[45:54] I've never even heard of it happening he
[45:57] said ' that's right there's no
[45:58] remarrying nowhere at all except a dead
[46:00] companion that's all now of course what
[46:02] three years later God would show him
[46:04] this Revelation on a on a uh there is
[46:08] one case for divorce and remarriage
[46:09] there just one so we'll talk about that
[46:11] here he might even explain it right here
[46:13] uh you can't make it contradict itself
[46:15] so just read the verses before and after
[46:16] that's a good good advice so if 1
[46:18] Corinthians 7:15 is a question just read
[46:21] read before read after brother gives us
[46:23] that great advice you'll catch then what
[46:24] he's talking about does this mean a
[46:26] sister or brother is free to remarry no
[46:28] sir see he explained that
[46:31] first uh there's no such thing as any
[46:33] believer ever being reconciled to
[46:35] remarriage again with a living
[46:38] companion okay now verse 16 for what
[46:40] knowest thou oh wife whether Thou shalt
[46:42] save thy husband or how knowest thou oh
[46:44] man whether Thou shalt save thy wife so
[46:46] none of us know the future so Paul's
[46:47] saying if you're a Believer and you're
[46:49] married to unbeliever just stay in that
[46:51] and pray for the person's soul to be
[46:53] saved keep believing because your life
[46:55] will sanctify theirs automatically
[46:58] brother Ram said you're either going to
[46:59] pull you're either going to pull that
[47:00] sinful spouse up or they're going to
[47:02] pull you down so you better be super
[47:03] strong right you if you're married to an
[47:05] unbeliever right you got to just you got
[47:07] to just live the life you got to have a
[47:09] strong prayer life you got to be
[47:10] speaking the word all the time you got
[47:11] to be in church all the time you just
[47:13] got to be fully devoted and you got to
[47:15] rebuke Satan every time he comes in you
[47:16] just got to be fully uh fully devoted to
[47:19] the Lord Jesus Christ verse 17 But as
[47:22] God has distributed to every man as the
[47:23] Lord hath called everyone so let him
[47:25] walk and so ordain I in all the
[47:29] churches is any man called being
[47:31] circumcised let him not become
[47:32] circumcised is any called an
[47:34] uncircumcision let him not be
[47:37] circumcised so your calling in life or
[47:40] your life story that God wrote before
[47:42] the foundation world uh is distributed
[47:45] to you from God and distribute means to
[47:48] separate in Parts divide it into parties
[47:50] so another word is like lot like the Old
[47:52] Testament you know Joshua gave them
[47:54] their lot or their predestinated
[47:57] boundaries right so the same thing's
[47:59] true in the New Testament not naturally
[48:01] necessarily but spiritually God has a
[48:03] predetermined lot uh for your life for
[48:05] your life story and so if you're a
[48:08] sinner you're married to a sinner but
[48:10] then the the word comes to you well
[48:12] that's your lot in life God called you
[48:14] to overcome in that story in that
[48:17] testimony uh you can't feel bad
[48:19] necessarily about the past now we all
[48:20] feel bad about our sinful past but we
[48:21] have to remember God has a a a
[48:24] distribution for a testimony for each
[48:27] and every person and we have to accept
[48:29] that and then do all we can do to serve
[48:31] God within that predestinated uh
[48:33] boundary that God gives us our life
[48:36] story and this was given by God himself
[48:38] Paul says it it's it's God distributed
[48:40] God so God called you wherever you were
[48:43] uh whether you're married single Jew or
[48:45] Gentile wherever you were child adult
[48:48] old man old woman young man young woman
[48:51] God knew exactly where you'd be when he
[48:53] would finally get a hold of your heart
[48:54] because he knows your decisions he knows
[48:56] everything beforehand and it's all uh
[48:59] it's all planned out by God he declares
[49:01] the end from the beginning he knew the
[49:03] time you would choose him and uh he
[49:05] moved into your life at just the right
[49:08] time verse 19 circumcision is nothing
[49:11] uncircumcision is nothing but the
[49:12] keeping the Commandments of God hey you
[49:13] guys want to read some verses that be
[49:15] okay Malachi you want to read 20 let
[49:17] every man abide in the same calling
[49:19] where he was called all right so so so
[49:22] far Paul's listed two callings so I'll
[49:23] just go this way is that okay guys you
[49:24] want to read this
[49:26] uh Paul's listed two callings so far so
[49:29] uh your first calling is is one of your
[49:31] callings is marriage that whatever
[49:32] you're called to whether it be single or
[49:34] uh married to a holy ghost filled Saint
[49:36] or maybe you're a Believer and you're
[49:38] married to an unbeliever uh that's part
[49:41] of your calling and then if you're a Jew
[49:42] or Gentiles all of us here are Gentiles
[49:44] right most people listen to me would be
[49:46] uh considered Gentiles that's part of
[49:47] your calling you weren't called as a a
[49:50] Jew Jewish convert into a Messianic Jew
[49:52] coming into
[49:53] Christianity and now next in verse 21 he
[49:56] a third uh calling in life so Caris you
[50:00] want to read verse 21 art thou called
[50:02] being a servant care not for it but thou
[50:05] may be free use it rather all right
[50:08] great so now he brings in a third one
[50:11] whether you're a free person or your
[50:13] indentured servant or even perhaps a
[50:15] slave this is the time of the Roman
[50:17] Kingdom so they could have had slaves um
[50:20] so Paul said wherever you are you got to
[50:22] recognize that's where whenever the
[50:23] gospel came to you that was God's
[50:25] calling for your life you're called to
[50:26] overcome in that particular portion of
[50:30] uh of your life and he said uh if but if
[50:33] you're made free if you are not free but
[50:34] you're made free use it rather which
[50:36] means to a greater degree so take
[50:38] advantage of your freedom serve God uh
[50:40] do even more with the freedom that you
[50:42] experience as a free man or woman and
[50:44] thank God we have all that in America I
[50:46] know sometimes we feel like we're slaves
[50:47] to our jobs but we don't have we're not
[50:49] really we chose to work there um but God
[50:52] is gracious to us so brother Austin you
[50:54] want to read 22 for he that is called in
[50:57] the Lord being a servant is the Lord's
[50:59] free man likewise also he that is called
[51:02] being free is Christ's servant thank you
[51:05] brother so Paul says basically we're all
[51:07] we're all free in one way and we're all
[51:09] servants in one way so do you see that
[51:12] so Paul says if if you're called if
[51:13] you're called to be a Christian and
[51:15] you're a servant you're still free in
[51:16] Christ then he says if you're called
[51:18] being free you're a servant so we're
[51:20] both
[51:21] free uh spiritually and we're a servant
[51:24] spiritually that's the point Paul's
[51:25] making right we in other words we don't
[51:28] have to serve the devil we don't have to
[51:29] give into the devil we're free from
[51:30] those things right we're free from those
[51:31] chains right so it's a beautiful
[51:34] scripture so Paul says you know that
[51:36] that's why Paul said I've learned in
[51:37] whatever state I'm in I've learned to be
[51:38] content remember that in Philippians
[51:40] chapter 4 that and that's one of his
[51:42] great lessons he had to learn later on
[51:43] in life I've got to learn to be content
[51:45] no matter where I am okay so verse 23
[51:48] you want to try that Victoria all right
[51:51] are of Christ not ye Servants of all
[51:55] right great verse there now remember he
[51:56] already said this in chapter 6 we're
[51:57] bought with a price our bodies are
[51:58] bought bought with a price but he
[52:00] reminds you you're bought with a price
[52:02] you're bought by the blood of Jesus
[52:03] Christ so the blood forgives you if
[52:05] you're a a free person if you're a
[52:07] dentur servant if you're a slave uh what
[52:10] wherever God bought you and he placed
[52:13] you in that position to be an overcomer
[52:16] but he says don't be the Servants of men
[52:19] other words don't I think yeah yeah
[52:20] Brian remember Brian used that verse on
[52:22] Sunday cursed is he who trusts in man so
[52:25] whether you're free or whether you're uh
[52:28] B in bondage don't trust in men like he
[52:30] says later to Timothy don't trust in
[52:32] riches right another but if you're not
[52:34] if you're poor don't trust in the
[52:35] government or don't trust in uh your
[52:38] your slave master or your whatever your
[52:40] boss don't trust in that because you're
[52:42] bought with a price Jesus Paid for you
[52:45] for your body and then he says uh abide
[52:48] in where he called you so let's have
[52:49] Kisha read uh 24 rather that every man
[52:53] wherein he is called therein abide with
[52:55] God now this is quite a statement this
[52:57] has caused a lot of people to be upset
[52:58] but Paul's basically telling people in
[53:00] bondage uh just abide there in other
[53:02] words abide there until you can get your
[53:04] freedom right in other words don't be
[53:07] discontented uh uh don't doubt that
[53:10] somehow you know something's wrong God
[53:13] gave that portion to you right we just
[53:14] saw that God distributed that that
[53:16] testimony to you and thank God we have a
[53:18] testimony praise God thank God we're not
[53:20] Sinners thank God we can have a
[53:21] testimony for Jesus Christ and we can
[53:23] overcome no matter what state we're in
[53:24] we uh we know we can overcome in any
[53:27] situation because the greater is he
[53:28] that's in us than he that's in the world
[53:30] praise God so we see that so God is with
[53:32] you in your calling no matter if you're
[53:35] Jew Gentile uh married single uh if
[53:39] you're slave free indentured servant
[53:41] wherever you are God is with you in your
[53:43] calling and you must be content in your
[53:45] calling okay now verse 25 we go to
[53:48] Haven now concerning virgins I have no
[53:51] Commandments of the Lord yet I give my
[53:54] judgment as one that obtaineth mercy of
[53:56] the Lord to be faithful okay so again I
[53:58] love this he pinpoints it I have nothing
[54:00] on the Lord from this but this is my
[54:02] best understanding in this Roman
[54:04] government right here in Corinth uh he I
[54:07] love how he States it plainly this is
[54:10] Paul's judgment okay verse 26 brother
[54:12] chrisan want read that I suppose I
[54:14] suppose therefore that this is good for
[54:17] the present distress I say that it is
[54:21] good for a man so to be okay so notice
[54:25] Paul recognizes a dist right this is a
[54:27] problem so did Brother Bram that's a
[54:29] good verse brother BR uses at the end of
[54:30] the sermon a marriage and divorce if you
[54:31] listen to that it's a distress I mean so
[54:34] in Paul's day the people were distressed
[54:36] do we mean are we should we We selib bit
[54:38] how do I control the fire if I got this
[54:41] fire inside of me it's just a distress
[54:43] how do we uh deal with this and so here
[54:46] Paul gives them some wisdom especially
[54:48] now these virgins The Virgins were under
[54:50] distress to should we get married should
[54:51] we not uh Paul says I'm going to give
[54:53] you my just or best judgment because I
[54:55] found Mercy from God and I've been a
[54:57] faithful Apostle I started many churches
[55:00] I've been on three this might have been
[55:01] a second missionary trip I've been on
[55:03] these missionary trips Jesus met me in
[55:05] uh in Arabia and uh commissioned me to
[55:07] write the
[55:08] Bible so uh verse uh 27 we'll go back to
[55:12] Mal there art thou bound unto a wife
[55:15] seek not to be loose art th loose from a
[55:18] wife seek not a wife okay so this is
[55:21] Paul's uh advice under the current
[55:23] distress of living in Corinth again
[55:26] there's all this prostitution they're
[55:27] not sure what to do uh should I get
[55:29] married should I not there's all this
[55:31] talk and the gifts of the Spirit are
[55:33] operating so Paul says if you're
[55:36] bound if you're married to a wife just
[55:38] just stay with her don't don't try to be
[55:40] loose if you're loose from her don't
[55:43] seek a wife just stay separate so Paul's
[55:45] just trying to give them some advice in
[55:46] the midst of this distress in other
[55:48] words don't make a quick bad decision
[55:50] right just stay as you are you know give
[55:53] God some time to work right give give
[55:55] give God time to water you preachers to
[55:58] plant water God gives the increase right
[56:00] don't make any big awful decisions verse
[56:03] 28 uh is it Caris but and if thou Mary
[56:08] thou Hast not sinned and if a Virgin
[56:12] Mary she sh she hasth not sinned
[56:14] nevertheless such shall have trouble in
[56:19] the flesh but I spare you so Paul with
[56:22] his wisdom is trying to tell him you
[56:23] know if you get married there's there's
[56:25] there's more
[56:27] troubles and uh again this is his own
[56:31] this is his own conviction right but you
[56:33] got to look at the other side too you
[56:35] know you could be burning right and then
[56:37] Paul says you better get married if
[56:38] you're burning right uh and then also
[56:41] God remember God ordained marriage in
[56:43] Genesis chapter 1 that was his
[56:46] institution uh and then three Paul still
[56:49] had a lot of troubles remember his
[56:51] resume in 2 Corinthians we're going to
[56:52] get to that Lord willing if God carries
[56:55] just this tremendous resume of troubles
[56:57] and suffering he said troubles within
[56:59] troubles without fears within fears
[57:01] without so in other words you're going
[57:03] to have trouble either way so if you
[57:06] have the gift to be single be single
[57:08] you're still gonna have trouble but if
[57:10] you're burning and you don't have that
[57:11] gift get married uh there's going to be
[57:14] troubles in life right there's troubles
[57:16] uh for us it's emergency room troubles
[57:18] right or other troubles you know you
[57:20] just have difficulties in life difficult
[57:22] decisions family situations relatives
[57:25] neighbors you know
[57:26] you have all these uh all these troubles
[57:28] in
[57:29] life okay verse 29 we brother
[57:32] Austin but this I say Brethren the time
[57:35] is short it remain that both they that
[57:38] have wives be as though they had none
[57:40] okay so again Paul says the time is
[57:42] short now I didn't get to this thought
[57:44] it might be the next yeah I didn't get
[57:45] to this thought but there are numerous
[57:47] verses from Paul and Peter where they're
[57:48] saying like the Lord is coming soon time
[57:51] is short now were they lying no no they
[57:53] were inspired to warn the people and if
[57:56] they said the time is short well there's
[57:58] different ways to approach it do they
[58:00] mean if if they're talking about time
[58:02] short in the perspective of God it's
[58:04] right if they're talking about their
[58:06] lives are short and Christ could end
[58:08] come at any time that's true too okay so
[58:11] some people think you know the Bible
[58:12] contradicts itself it doesn't uh and
[58:14] then the other thing is you know Paul or
[58:16] Peter could be saying that just from
[58:17] their own wisdom or their own human
[58:19] understanding their own convictions just
[58:21] like Paul says this is not the Lord this
[58:24] is I so we have all the those different
[58:26] options in there but clearly from God's
[58:29] perspective the time is short because A
[58:32] Thousand Years is as one day with God
[58:34] think it's only been two two days since
[58:36] Jesus was crucified and resurrected and
[58:37] sent the Holy Ghost it's not even been
[58:39] two days actually it's not even been two
[58:42] days yeah uh so that's amazing what did
[58:45] you do two days ago that that's that's
[58:46] what God would feel like uh in the
[58:48] timeline of
[58:50] time okay thanks brother Austin uh 29 uh
[58:53] Victoria
[58:57] 29 yeah 29 wait is that right brother or
[59:00] no you read that I'm sorry thank you
[59:01] brother 30 H sorry and that weep as
[59:06] though
[59:07] they we not and they that rejoice as
[59:12] though they
[59:13] Rejoice Rejoice not and they that buy as
[59:18] though
[59:20] they possess not very good so what is
[59:24] Paul saying the time is short right
[59:26] uh he's saying in other words don't go
[59:29] overboard with weeping don't don't get
[59:30] carried away with emotions and crying
[59:32] try to try to stay in the middle right
[59:34] don't get overtaken with emotion try to
[59:36] be more solid and then uh Rejoice
[59:40] rejoicing is good but don't go too far
[59:42] on that either right be more
[59:44] sober you know and and then uh buying
[59:47] things don't get too busy with buying
[59:48] things and the cares of the world like
[59:49] brother Brian preached to us on Sunday
[59:52] uh try to be more content so Paul's and
[59:55] then Paul all relating this with
[59:57] marriage right uh try to be content in
[1:00:00] whatever situation you're in but if you
[1:00:02] have a desire to be married and burning
[1:00:04] then do that but only in the
[1:00:07] Lord okay all right we're getting close
[1:00:09] to the end here by God's grace uh verse
[1:00:13] 31 uh where we at brother OHA
[1:00:17] sorry and they that use this world as
[1:00:20] not abusing it for the fashion of this
[1:00:22] word pass away okay so again you know
[1:00:24] don't get caught up in the word riness
[1:00:26] don't abuse all your
[1:00:28] Liberties um the world Fashions of the
[1:00:30] world the trends of the world all come
[1:00:32] and go 32
[1:00:35] Haven but I would have you without
[1:00:37] carefulness he that is unmarried careth
[1:00:40] for the things that belong unto the Lord
[1:00:42] how he may please the Lord very good but
[1:00:45] Christian read 33 but he that is married
[1:00:47] careth for the things that are of the
[1:00:49] world how he may please his wife okay so
[1:00:52] Paul says if you do get married then
[1:00:54] you're going to care so much for the
[1:00:56] things of your family um and that that's
[1:01:00] true your focus comes on them but yet
[1:01:03] the other side of this remember this is
[1:01:04] just Paul's judgment the other side of
[1:01:06] that Paul Paul actually wrote about in
[1:01:08] Ephesians 5 right he said uh when a man
[1:01:11] loves his wife and cares for his wife
[1:01:14] it's as if he's showing the love of
[1:01:16] Christ to his wife and his love is like
[1:01:19] a symbol of Christ's love for the church
[1:01:23] so this is the balance on this you know
[1:01:24] Paul's saying you're going to have
[1:01:26] troubles if you get married uh but
[1:01:28] you're going to have trouble if you
[1:01:29] don't right you're going to have trouble
[1:01:30] either way uh so it's kind of based upon
[1:01:33] whether you burn or not or whether you
[1:01:34] have the gift of singleness or
[1:01:37] not um but yeah a woman that wants to
[1:01:40] care for the needs of her husband that's
[1:01:41] wonderful that's like the church caring
[1:01:43] about what Christ wants done you know
[1:01:45] doing the will of Christ it's a it's a
[1:01:48] one's natural one's spiritual okay all
[1:01:52] right verse 34 okay now I just want to
[1:01:54] put put this point in here but just so
[1:01:56] everybody knows a uh singleness seems to
[1:01:59] yield the greatest Heavenly reward but
[1:02:02] again that's based upon a gift in in in
[1:02:05] some cases not every case I think in uh
[1:02:07] Matthew 19 Jesus says some people can
[1:02:10] make themselves Unix uh or single um
[1:02:14] they do it either of the will of man or
[1:02:16] their own will um but it would take a
[1:02:19] lot of uh a lot of anointing of the Holy
[1:02:21] Spirit a lot of Grace if you don't
[1:02:23] exactly have that gift some are called
[1:02:24] by God Jesus says
[1:02:26] but uh clearly the greatest
[1:02:29] reward uh it seems like goes to those
[1:02:32] who are single and we know that because
[1:02:34] John the Baptist was called greatest in
[1:02:37] the Old Testament now why was that of
[1:02:39] course he
[1:02:40] introduced uh Jesus you know to the
[1:02:42] people um he actually got to see Jesus
[1:02:45] baptized Jesus everybody else just
[1:02:47] talked about him wrote about him but
[1:02:48] also he lived a life of total
[1:02:50] consecration he was physically
[1:02:53] consecrated um and spiritually
[1:02:55] consecrated ated he obeyed so much of
[1:02:57] the word of God now think about that
[1:02:59] like Moses killed a man right David
[1:03:00] killed a man John the Baptist didn't
[1:03:02] kill anybody you know John the Baptist
[1:03:04] he could have got married but he didn't
[1:03:05] he forsook marriage he was single so he
[1:03:08] could be prepared for his ministry so he
[1:03:10] made all John the Baptist made all these
[1:03:12] sacrifices and that's why I believe you
[1:03:15] know he was called of course he
[1:03:16] introduced Jesus all those things
[1:03:18] brother Ram taught us about but he's
[1:03:20] called the greatest in the Old Testament
[1:03:24] and then Jesus Jesus wasn't married
[1:03:25] right Jesus sacrificed everything for
[1:03:27] the kingdom of God of course he was
[1:03:28] sinless Son of God King of Kings Lord of
[1:03:30] lords no one would ever be greater than
[1:03:32] Jesus but just seeing that look at the
[1:03:34] life of sacrifice that he lived and look
[1:03:36] at this great reward okay and then the
[1:03:39] same thing for Paul now I I personally
[1:03:41] believe Paul will have the greatest
[1:03:42] reward in the New Testament I don't I
[1:03:44] don't claim I'm right that's just my
[1:03:46] humble thought because he was single his
[1:03:48] life matched John the Baptist in uh many
[1:03:50] ways of course they're both Martyrs uh
[1:03:53] for the gospel's sake so that's just
[1:03:55] something to keep in mind I I think Paul
[1:03:57] was constantly uh influencing the people
[1:04:00] uh to be single here so they can focus
[1:04:02] on the Lord uh because it does seem to
[1:04:04] yield the greatest reward but again
[1:04:07] that's just my humble thought I could be
[1:04:08] wrong on that okay verse 34 uh back to
[1:04:12] me there's a difference also between a
[1:04:15] wife and a virgin the unmarried woman
[1:04:17] care for the things of the world they
[1:04:18] seem to be holy both in body and in
[1:04:20] spirit but she that is married careth
[1:04:22] for the things of the world how sheens
[1:04:24] her husband okay so here Paul explains
[1:04:26] the difference um a married woman cares
[1:04:28] for the things of her husband a woman
[1:04:30] who's not married she cares she wants to
[1:04:32] be holy in her body and her spirit it's
[1:04:35] completely devoted to the Lord but a
[1:04:38] married woman her body belongs to her
[1:04:39] husband right so um so there's uh two
[1:04:43] different things there a husband caring
[1:04:44] for the needs of the husband and then if
[1:04:46] you're single caring for the needs of
[1:04:47] Christ or the desires of Christ okay uh
[1:04:50] verse 35
[1:04:53] Caris um and this I speak for your own
[1:04:57] prophit not that I may cast a share upon
[1:05:01] you but for what which is comely and
[1:05:05] that ye may attend upon the Lord without
[1:05:09] distraction all right very good
[1:05:11] hun okay so again you know that's Paul's
[1:05:14] saying I'm not trying to put you in
[1:05:15] bondage so if you have a burning uh to
[1:05:17] be married Paul said I'm not trying to
[1:05:19] put a snare on you so you know you'll be
[1:05:20] tempted to commit fornication all the
[1:05:22] time he said but I just want you to
[1:05:24] serve the Lord without raction so I
[1:05:26] think as I'm preaching this I'm just
[1:05:28] realizing how important it is for
[1:05:29] someone to realize if they're have the
[1:05:31] gift of singleness or not because you
[1:05:33] can get a really great reward uh if you
[1:05:37] are just single and able to do that by
[1:05:39] the gift of God in your life and also
[1:05:41] the
[1:05:42] consecration uh it's quite a quite a
[1:05:44] reward there um so brother Austin uh 36
[1:05:47] please but if any man think that he
[1:05:50] behave himself uncomely toward his
[1:05:52] virgin if she passed the flower of her
[1:05:54] age and needs so require let him do what
[1:05:57] he will he sinth not let them marry okay
[1:06:00] so Paul's saying you know even if a a
[1:06:03] single woman gets older she can still he
[1:06:06] can still marry her right because in
[1:06:08] those days they didn't live as long as
[1:06:10] we live I think their life expectancy
[1:06:11] was much shorter uh due to the
[1:06:13] Industrial Revolution and so forth but
[1:06:15] Paul's saying it's not a sin even for an
[1:06:17] older single woman who's never been
[1:06:19] married it's not a sin um she's maybe PL
[1:06:23] past the flower she can't have children
[1:06:24] anymore it's still not a sin so see
[1:06:27] Paul's giving all these judgments to
[1:06:29] people at every different level right
[1:06:30] you know you're you're younger you're
[1:06:32] older Paul's giving you're married
[1:06:33] you're single you're separated Paul
[1:06:35] gives like all this wisdom and all this
[1:06:37] advice to all the people in all the
[1:06:39] different areas of life very uh good
[1:06:41] chapter here 37 Victoria
[1:06:45] never
[1:06:47] nevertheless
[1:06:49] nevertheless he that standeth steadfast
[1:06:53] in his heart haveth no
[1:06:57] necessity
[1:06:59] necessity that have power over his own
[1:07:02] will and have so described decreed
[1:07:06] decreed in his heart that he will keep
[1:07:10] his version do with what very good now
[1:07:14] this is referring to the father of the
[1:07:16] Virgin or the father of the the girl
[1:07:18] who's not married so so Paul says here
[1:07:20] the the P the father even has this power
[1:07:22] too he can either give her or not it's
[1:07:24] kind of up to him him and of course it'd
[1:07:26] be up to the the the daughter too right
[1:07:28] he would want to take his daughter is
[1:07:29] she burning you know because Paul says
[1:07:31] it's better to marry than to burn so the
[1:07:33] father and the daughter have to have of
[1:07:34] course of prayer time talk time
[1:07:36] counseling time see how she feels about
[1:07:38] it seek the Lord surely the Lord will
[1:07:40] answer if we really seek and fast and
[1:07:42] pray and find his will should I marry
[1:07:44] this guy or not surely the Lord would
[1:07:46] answer
[1:07:47] right okay then verse 38 uh Casa so then
[1:07:52] he that giveth her in marriage doth well
[1:07:54] but he that giveth are not in marriage
[1:07:56] to his better okay so again that's
[1:07:57] Paul's right Paul's judgment Paul's
[1:07:59] opinion it's better for a father to keep
[1:08:01] his daughters unmarried that's what Paul
[1:08:03] says U because it because you they can
[1:08:06] serve the Lord without distraction right
[1:08:09] because remember you know remember who
[1:08:11] had that great testimony wasn't it Anna
[1:08:13] in the New Testament she dedicated
[1:08:15] Decades of prayer and fasting and then
[1:08:16] she got to see
[1:08:18] Jesus so that's that's a great example
[1:08:21] of dedication fasting and praying that's
[1:08:23] the ministry uh of a single woman she
[1:08:26] can give herself more holy to that
[1:08:29] prayer and fasting so 39 Haven the wife
[1:08:33] is bound by the law as long as her
[1:08:35] husband liveth but if her husband be
[1:08:37] dead she is at Liberty to be married to
[1:08:39] whom she will only in the Lord all right
[1:08:41] so this is the verse brother R says
[1:08:43] after verse 15 right that proves you a
[1:08:46] couple cannot separate and then remarry
[1:08:48] and think God's okay with it no if a
[1:08:51] couple is already married they are
[1:08:52] joined in God's sight until death until
[1:08:55] death okay and she's only either one is
[1:08:58] only at Liberty to be married again if
[1:09:01] the the other spouse dies okay verse 40
[1:09:04] brother Chris but she is happier she so
[1:09:07] abide after my judgment and I think also
[1:09:10] that I have the spirit of God all right
[1:09:12] so there again Paul uh believing he had
[1:09:15] the spirit of God she'd be happier if
[1:09:17] she remains single rather than being
[1:09:19] married even at an older age uh but i' I
[1:09:21] known I've known a couple years ago this
[1:09:24] this woman uh was sing I think she until
[1:09:26] she was 40 or 45 and then she got
[1:09:29] married uh to an older man like she
[1:09:30] might have been 45 he might have been 60
[1:09:33] but she was so H and they were so happy
[1:09:35] together was over in Pennsylvania years
[1:09:37] ago not albian but a different
[1:09:39] Pennsylvania city so it was really just
[1:09:41] really sweet you know she wanted to be
[1:09:42] married all of her life but she was just
[1:09:43] patient on the Lord and then this this
[1:09:46] man came along and his wife had died and
[1:09:49] uh he wanted a wife and so they found
[1:09:51] each other it's really it's really
[1:09:52] something to see how sweet they were
[1:09:54] with each other like God Grace okay I'm
[1:09:56] finish up with a couple things here I
[1:09:57] got a couple more slides
[1:09:59] here now I want to go back into just
[1:10:01] review here real quick
[1:10:03] um there is one cause this might be new
[1:10:06] I'm looking at brother Chris this might
[1:10:08] be new to him there is one cause when a
[1:10:11] man can actually divorce his wife and
[1:10:13] then remarry there's only one but it's
[1:10:16] so rare okay and and it's a case like
[1:10:18] this if a couple gets
[1:10:20] married okay but the man later finds out
[1:10:24] that she lied to him and she had she had
[1:10:27] had relations with other maybe one man
[1:10:29] or another man other words she wasn't a
[1:10:31] pure
[1:10:32] virgin if the man finds out later that
[1:10:34] she lied that's the one time a man is
[1:10:37] allowed to divorce her and then marry
[1:10:39] another woman because the vow was given
[1:10:42] in dishonesty it was a dishonest vow so
[1:10:45] it's not a sin for him to for him is it
[1:10:47] vice versa like if he lied to her can
[1:10:51] she leave that's a good question but the
[1:10:53] Bible doesn't say that the Bible just
[1:10:54] says the man only and that's what
[1:10:57] brother bam explains now I've known
[1:10:59] people that have done that I'm just
[1:11:01] praying God don't please don't let me be
[1:11:03] in that
[1:11:04] situation you know because I just
[1:11:07] because Jesus doesn't say the woman can
[1:11:08] do it only the man can do it and brother
[1:11:10] Ram talks about that so that's a great
[1:11:12] question excellent question very
[1:11:14] spiritual question okay here's where
[1:11:16] brother R says it
[1:11:17] um let's go to Matthew 199 I don't I
[1:11:20] don't think I have that verse on here
[1:11:21] Matthew
[1:11:23] 199 who we at is that bro whose turn is
[1:11:26] it to read who thank you read that
[1:11:30] Matthew
[1:11:33] 199 whenever you're ready buddy and I
[1:11:36] say unto you whosoever shall put away
[1:11:39] his wife except to be for fornication
[1:11:41] shall marry another committing adultery
[1:11:43] and who so Marth her which is also put
[1:11:45] which is put away do commit adultery
[1:11:47] excellent okay so there's one cause
[1:11:49] except it be for fornications that means
[1:11:51] the the the the the wife would have had
[1:11:54] sexual ations before they got married
[1:11:57] and she didn't tell him now if she told
[1:11:59] him then The Vow stands and they he
[1:12:02] can't put her away because she was
[1:12:03] honest The Vow was in Purity it was
[1:12:06] honest right now let's go to Matthew 5
[1:12:09] uh Caris go to Matthew 5 I think it's 31
[1:12:11] and 32 so you got to put a couple verses
[1:12:14] of Jesus together and then you'll have
[1:12:16] you'll understand you'll understand this
[1:12:19] then brother Austin could you go to
[1:12:20] Matthew chapter one you have your
[1:12:22] phone we'll show
[1:12:25] uh I don't know so I think it's think
[1:12:26] it's 19 or 21 but it's at the end of the
[1:12:30] chapter okay but uh we're going to Caris
[1:12:33] Matthew
[1:12:35] 5 yeah okay it's 31 and 32 so Caris do
[1:12:38] you want to read
[1:12:42] 3132 it hath been said whosoever shall
[1:12:45] put away his wife let him give her a
[1:12:48] writing of divorcement but I say unto
[1:12:51] you that whosoever shall put away his
[1:12:54] wife say
[1:12:55] for the cause of fornication causeth her
[1:12:58] to commit adultery and whosoever shall
[1:13:01] marry her that is divorce committed
[1:13:03] adultery okay so here it says saving for
[1:13:06] the cause of
[1:13:08] fornication okay so there's only one
[1:13:11] cause and like I said I've I've been a
[1:13:12] Christian for 25 years I've never seen
[1:13:15] this
[1:13:16] happen because usually the women know
[1:13:19] just tell everything tell all your past
[1:13:20] now you don't have to get into all the
[1:13:21] the sick details or whatever but just
[1:13:24] you have you known a man or not that's
[1:13:27] the most important thing uh when a
[1:13:28] couple's getting married because that's
[1:13:30] the only way they could actually divorce
[1:13:32] and then the man could
[1:13:34] Remar okay so let's see the the example
[1:13:37] a Bible example is in Matthew chapter 1
[1:13:39] now Joseph and Mary were spoused to be
[1:13:42] married right they were engaged in other
[1:13:44] words and then they found out she was
[1:13:46] pregnant well Joseph thought she had
[1:13:47] known a man so Joseph was going to put
[1:13:49] her away and remarry so this is a Bible
[1:13:52] example this is the only time you could
[1:13:53] divorce a a woman and put her away in
[1:13:56] the New Testament and Remar and that's
[1:13:58] when the Angels Came no this is
[1:14:00] conceived of the Holy Ghost yes this is
[1:14:02] Jesus okay so I want to show that
[1:14:10] um yeah brother can you read uh 18 19
[1:14:13] brother
[1:14:14] Austin now the birth of Jesus Christ was
[1:14:17] on this when as his mother Mary was
[1:14:19] spouse to Joseph before they came
[1:14:21] together she was found with the child of
[1:14:23] the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband
[1:14:26] being just a man and not willing to make
[1:14:29] her a public example was minded to put
[1:14:31] her away okay so Joseph was I'm just
[1:14:34] going to private thank you brother I'm
[1:14:36] gonna privately put you away because he
[1:14:38] could have had her stoned she could have
[1:14:40] been stoned according to law of Moses
[1:14:41] but he's like I'm a just man I'm a fair
[1:14:43] man I don't know I didn't see it so he
[1:14:46] said I'm just going to do it privately
[1:14:47] but then verse 20 but while he thought
[1:14:49] on these things behold the angel Lord
[1:14:51] appeared unto him in a dream saying
[1:14:53] Joseph thou son son of David fear not to
[1:14:56] take unto thee Mary thy wife for that
[1:14:58] which is conceived of her is of the Holy
[1:15:00] Ghost okay and notice the angel calls
[1:15:04] Mary his wife before they had relations
[1:15:07] so that that's how serious a vow is in
[1:15:10] the New Testament as soon as you're
[1:15:11] engaged you're married in the sight of
[1:15:13] God as soon as you say will you marry me
[1:15:15] she says yes I will you're married in
[1:15:17] the sight of God and the only way of is
[1:15:20] one of them dies yes yes very good
[1:15:22] brother very good excellent great good
[1:15:25] you got it man good job and so that's
[1:15:27] what brother R says here
[1:15:29] um she has to confess that fornication
[1:15:33] to her husband before they're married if
[1:15:34] she's did that if not and her husband
[1:15:36] finds out later he has the right to put
[1:15:38] her away because she took a false vow
[1:15:40] the Bible said well the Bible does say
[1:15:42] it but then the ritual also says like
[1:15:44] you'll hear this at weddings um if any
[1:15:47] couples are joined otherwise than God
[1:15:49] word does allow their marriage is not
[1:15:50] lawful it's I say that when you guys got
[1:15:53] married I say that not pre most
[1:15:55] preachers probably today don't say that
[1:15:57] because they're so far from traditional
[1:15:59] bible-based
[1:16:00] marriages okay
[1:16:04] um I'll read the blue part if a brother
[1:16:07] man said if a man marries a woman and
[1:16:08] she has lived unclean before she marries
[1:16:10] him and then she comes to him if they've
[1:16:12] been married ever so long and then she
[1:16:14] comes to him and says honey I want to
[1:16:16] tell you something I did run out with
[1:16:17] another man I Never Told You Jesus said
[1:16:19] he has a right to put her away and marry
[1:16:21] another because they're not married in
[1:16:22] the beginning because she falsely told a
[1:16:25] lie against him so that's exactly what
[1:16:27] Jesus said saving for the cause of
[1:16:29] fornication that's the only way and then
[1:16:30] we see that played out with Joseph and
[1:16:32] Mary but the Holy Ghost stepped in there
[1:16:34] and showed exactly what had happened
[1:16:36] there by God's grace so they were United
[1:16:38] and brother Ram repeats this in
[1:16:40] 1965 in the sermon marriage and divorce
[1:16:43] we read uh we had Caris read Matthew 5
[1:16:48] 31-32 now here's here's where brother
[1:16:49] rown says only the man can do this not
[1:16:52] the woman and here's his explanation
[1:16:54] it's because man represents Christ and
[1:16:57] the woman represents the church it's a
[1:16:58] pretty simple type um but in other words
[1:17:01] like the church isn't going to put away
[1:17:02] Jesus and Jesus would never do anything
[1:17:04] wrong but the church the woman the
[1:17:06] church can't put away Jesus and I'll
[1:17:07] marry somebody else he's God he's the
[1:17:11] perfect true husband you would I mean
[1:17:12] the woman would never think of doing
[1:17:14] that so brother R says that's why Jesus
[1:17:16] said only a man can do this okay so see
[1:17:19] she's got a living husband so no man can
[1:17:21] marry her like if if a couple's
[1:17:23] separated care what she does or who she
[1:17:25] is she's got a living husband there's no
[1:17:27] grounds for her at all but it's not for
[1:17:29] him because Jesus said causes her not
[1:17:32] him brother says get it you have to make
[1:17:35] the word run in continuity or it's got
[1:17:37] to run in parallels it's got to agree
[1:17:39] everywhere see nothing says he couldn't
[1:17:41] divorce and remarry but she can't see
[1:17:44] causes her not him that's exactly what
[1:17:46] the Bible says causes her it's not St
[1:17:48] against him to Remar but her why Christ
[1:17:51] in the
[1:17:52] type okay and then he gives examp
[1:17:54] examples from the there's my hour so I'm
[1:17:56] going to try to finish up David could
[1:17:59] David could marry uh multiple women but
[1:18:01] none of those women could ever put him
[1:18:03] away and marry another right but David
[1:18:05] could put a wife away away and marry
[1:18:06] another so could Solomon and all the
[1:18:09] rest of these because the man represents
[1:18:11] Christ and the woman represents the
[1:18:13] church I'm going to skip ahead there
[1:18:19] U yeah here brother Ram referen 1
[1:18:21] Corinthians 7:10 and he mentions those
[1:18:23] two a woman that's separated from her
[1:18:25] husband only has two choices she either
[1:18:27] has to remain single or be reconciled
[1:18:29] brother R emphasizes that in marriage
[1:18:32] and divorce Paul commands the wife that
[1:18:34] is that divorc her husband to remain
[1:18:36] single or be reconciled not to remarry
[1:18:39] she must remain single or be reconciled
[1:18:41] back to her husband she cannot
[1:18:44] remarry you can't make the word of God
[1:18:46] lie and everybody said amen okay I
[1:18:49] didn't I didn't get to this slide so I'm
[1:18:50] not going to go over this here tonight
[1:18:53] um but I'll just
[1:18:55] generally brother Maham uh brother
[1:18:57] Braham says polygamy is wrong so if a
[1:19:00] man marries multiple women and lives
[1:19:02] with them that's wrong
[1:19:05] um uh a man can only have one wife at a
[1:19:07] time right one at a time like brother
[1:19:10] Bram was married to hope hope died well
[1:19:12] then brother BR could remarry MAA but
[1:19:14] you can only have one at a time except
[1:19:16] in the case of that one case if a a
[1:19:19] woman uh lies about her vow then the man
[1:19:22] would have to put away that woman he's
[1:19:24] got a living spouse but she did a false
[1:19:26] vow and he has a new wife that'd be the
[1:19:29] only way that can happen but I guess in
[1:19:31] God's eyes the putaway wife was never
[1:19:33] his wife to begin with because she lied
[1:19:36] that's how how important it is to always
[1:19:37] tell the
[1:19:38] truth okay so I'm GNA skip past this I'm
[1:19:40] GNA try to finish up here um lot of I'm
[1:19:42] not get all I didn't get to all
[1:19:46] these so this week I put out a a a video
[1:19:49] kind of addressed three topics the
[1:19:51] seven-year tribulation interracial
[1:19:52] marriage and um what's the other one oh
[1:19:55] ministers aren't required to marry
[1:19:57] virgins in the New Testament but I just
[1:19:58] thought I would go over this because
[1:19:59] it's a it's a good thought so I put out
[1:20:03] this video and someone came against me
[1:20:05] with an argument and said uh well uh
[1:20:08] Genesis 1: 11:12 teach a seed must bring
[1:20:12] forth of its kind so they said you can't
[1:20:14] have an interracial marriage and I said
[1:20:16] that's ridiculous all marriages bring
[1:20:18] forth of their kind they bring forth
[1:20:19] humans so this this these people are so
[1:20:22] obsessed with skin color the Bible
[1:20:24] doesn't is not talking about skin color
[1:20:26] in Genesis 1 uh 11 and 12 this is how
[1:20:30] ridiculous some people are they they uh
[1:20:33] brother Ram says brother Ram says if
[1:20:36] Satan can't keep you from seeing the
[1:20:37] truth he'll push you off on some extreme
[1:20:40] to make you a Fanatic in some area and
[1:20:43] that's how fanatical these people are
[1:20:44] they're using verses that are totally
[1:20:46] out of context don't even make sense uh
[1:20:49] with the scripture because what about uh
[1:20:52] Moses and Zapora what about Moses
[1:20:55] brother random said God chose Zapora for
[1:20:58] Moses God chose to do an interracial
[1:21:01] marriage right and brother BR said God
[1:21:03] chose her because the poor would save
[1:21:04] Moses's life at least once was it twice
[1:21:07] or once the the
[1:21:10] foreskin uh was it just once or was it
[1:21:12] twice I thought it might have been I'll
[1:21:14] have to look that up I thought it might
[1:21:15] have been twice but at least once uh
[1:21:18] Zapora saved his life the angel was
[1:21:21] going to kill uh Moses CU he didn't
[1:21:23] circumcise his two sons and who stepped
[1:21:25] in and saved him his wife and so God
[1:21:28] chose Zapora for
[1:21:30] Moses and how could uh how could God
[1:21:33] choose a woman against the law of the
[1:21:36] seed so if you have a quote from brother
[1:21:38] brandom and then the the verse they got
[1:21:41] to go together if you're going to do a a
[1:21:43] true Bible teaching right then the other
[1:21:46] one they tried to say uh well
[1:21:48] interracial marriage like MOS and zapor
[1:21:50] was only allowed for a few couples
[1:21:53] because they typed Christ in the church
[1:21:55] and I said that's nonsense all marriages
[1:21:58] type Christ in the church you just have
[1:22:00] to read Genesis or Ephesians chapter 5
[1:22:02] right the husband must love as Christ
[1:22:04] loved the church the wife must submit as
[1:22:07] the church submits to
[1:22:09] Christ and it just doesn't makes sense
[1:22:11] what other type could there be of
[1:22:13] marriage uh Satan and the great
[1:22:15] like what uh Satan and it just doesn't
[1:22:19] there there's no other types of of
[1:22:20] marriage it's only Christ and the church
[1:22:23] so
[1:22:25] um I just thought I'd share that because
[1:22:26] it's been a recent thing uh for me this
[1:22:28] week and it also shows the word will
[1:22:31] always be true like if you rightly
[1:22:33] divide the word of Truth it'll always be
[1:22:35] true remember there's at least five
[1:22:36] interracial marriages in the Bible let's
[1:22:38] see if I can remember them Moses and
[1:22:41] Zapora Joseph and azth um Ruth and
[1:22:46] Boaz um sammon and uh Rahab and Uriah
[1:22:51] and basba there there's five right there
[1:22:54] and I'm sure there's numerous other ones
[1:22:57] but there's five and God ordained all
[1:22:59] those and God even put basheba in one of
[1:23:02] Jesus's lineages God put Rahab and Ruth
[1:23:05] in one of Jesus lineages like God put
[1:23:07] interracial marriages right in the
[1:23:09] lineage of Jesus Christ so we know God
[1:23:12] is not against interracial marriage
[1:23:14] brother random was against it because I
[1:23:15] believe for two reasons uh because it
[1:23:18] was illegal till 1967 and because of all
[1:23:21] the all the violence the racial violence
[1:23:23] and Wars during his lifetime so he
[1:23:25] wouldn't want to see anybody have to
[1:23:27] break the law but then also experience
[1:23:29] you know violence and things like that
[1:23:31] but we're thankful for the word of God
[1:23:32] tonight Hallelujah by God's grace I
[1:23:34] think I'll stop y I think I'll stop
[1:23:35] there by God's grace so Mali can come
[1:23:37] here hope this was edifying by God's
[1:23:40] grace I love chapter 7 chapter 7 is is
[1:23:42] just a tremendous chapter here I trust
[1:23:44] those scriptures were helpful um it's so
[1:23:47] important to keep going over these you
[1:23:48] know we got people that are single uh we
[1:23:51] got young people we need to teach you
[1:23:52] know as they're growing up here they
[1:23:54] really need to understand marriage and
[1:23:55] divorce uh brother Ram said it's the
[1:23:57] second greatest decision in your life
[1:23:59] the most greatest decision is to follow
[1:24:01] Christ become a Christian the second
[1:24:03] biggest decision is who you're going to
[1:24:04] marry so super important to cover this
[1:24:06] tonight as we preach through the the
[1:24:08] book of Corinthians I hope that was a
[1:24:09] blessing and I also want to revisit the
[1:24:12] one way there can be divorce and
[1:24:14] remarriage and then just a little bit on
[1:24:16] interracial marriage hope that was a
[1:24:18] help by God's grace well let's bow our
[1:24:20] heads here tonight father God we thank
[1:24:22] you for the word of God that we've heard
