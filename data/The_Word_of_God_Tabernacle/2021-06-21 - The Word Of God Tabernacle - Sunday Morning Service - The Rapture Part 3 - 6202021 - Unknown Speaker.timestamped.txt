[36:40] father's day a day singled out it's a
[36:42] recognition to
[36:43] all that the fathers do lord and it
[36:46] seems like sometimes the
[36:47] way the country has gone and the way
[36:49] things are happening today is
[36:51] probably a fundamental breakdown of
[36:53] fathers being in homes
[36:55] and being fathers to their families and
[36:57] being being dads there to their children
[37:00] and lord it's a it's a bad uh

[40:17] wherefore comfort one another with these
[40:19] words
[40:20] and you can be seated if you like amen
[40:23] we come off
[40:24] last week uh actually the last couple of
[40:26] services really
[40:29] on speaking of the rapture being a and
[40:31] this is the rapture this uh the
[40:33] title the message today if we do that uh
[40:36] this is the rapture part three
[40:38] this is the third part of it of course
[40:40] the first couple of parts we've really
[40:41] majored
[40:42] mostly in the revelation of the of the
[40:45] rapture the rapture being at revelation
[40:47] faith being a revelation and that faith
[40:50] and what that faith is and the faith
[40:51] that speaks back to us
[40:53] as christians as believers as we hear
[40:56] that word
[40:56] and have that word spoke back to us and
[40:59] of
[41:00] the word that that word speak to our
[41:02] hearts as that word speaks to our hearts
[41:04] if you're born again
[41:06] and have the holy spirit as that word
[41:08] speaks it becomes revealed to you
[41:10] because it becomes real and as it
[41:12] becomes real we become more like what we
[41:14] are becoming or molding into the image
[41:17] of
[41:17] which is the word which is jesus christ
[41:20] so we're molding into that very image to
[41:24] be that
[41:24] likeness of jesus for the invisible
[41:27] union that is taking place
[41:29] between christ and the bride that that
[41:31] that
[41:32] that appointed time when that last one
[41:35] comes
[41:36] and god's appointed time brings that
[41:38] bride together under the auspice of the
[41:40] shed blood of christ
[41:41] in the image of christ to a place as we
[41:44] like to call the rapture
[41:46] the catching away i believe as we've
[41:48] seen as mike is saying today that
[41:50] there's
[41:50] that thing that that that's unfolding in
[41:53] our world today
[41:54] is unfolding in our country and those
[41:56] are the things that the lord has
[41:58] revealed to us
[41:59] as we know is bringing us into that very
[42:02] capstone
[42:03] the very point of the top of that of
[42:06] that uh
[42:06] perfect statue of a perfect man of
[42:08] christ coming
[42:09] and capping off that body of course we
[42:12] know that we go to meet the lord in the
[42:14] air
[42:14] but that tapping is what is what this
[42:17] bride is looking to
[42:18] and and and believe that we're so very
[42:21] close to
[42:22] that that we're so very near not the
[42:24] capping but the going away
[42:25] yes amen of the body of christ now the
[42:28] point i want to get to start
[42:30] uh working on today is is waning off the
[42:33] faith a little bit into a different part
[42:36] and there's a lot i wanted to say today
[42:38] but i
[42:39] i felt like in study yesterday i was
[42:41] just gonna have to cut it in
[42:42] in two pieces so we'll just try to start
[42:45] with what we got here and go from there
[42:47] and we'll stop at a certain point and
[42:49] then pick it up again next week but i
[42:51] want to know
[42:52] want us to know that this rapture
[42:55] is only for this gentile bride amen
[42:59] the rapture that we're talking about now
[43:01] is only for the gentile bride now
[43:04] remember we know
[43:05] god has not forgot his chosen god has
[43:07] not forgotten the jews god has not
[43:09] forgotten his people
[43:11] he said never could he forget his people
[43:14] but
[43:14] this rapture this catching away is for
[43:17] the gentile bride only
[43:19] those that are down from the church age
[43:21] from the first day of pentecost all the
[43:23] way down

[43:35] group
[43:36] it's going to be all the way through
[43:37] from that time till now
[43:39] but it's only going to be for the bride
[43:41] of jesus christ

[44:52] the bride the bible says that there will
[44:54] be we just read it
[44:55] and it will be only for the elected lady
[44:59] the bride in this day that's pulled out
[45:02] of the church
[45:03] the bride that's been pulled out of the

[45:30] elect lady
[45:32] the one that is elected the one that is
[45:35] chosen
[45:35] predestined before the foundation of the
[45:38] world and again
[45:39] she is an international bride she's not
[45:42] just in these four walls she's not just
[45:44] into sauna arizona united
[45:46] states this bride is an international
[45:48] bride she's around the world
[45:50] again from the first church age to this
[45:52] church age there will be bride
[45:54] yeah they'll the dead in christ will
[45:56] rise first and the alive and remain
[45:58] group will have a body change and we'll
[45:59] be caught up together to meet the lord
[46:01] in the air
[46:01] amen she is the elect lady
[46:05] the holy spirit is calling that bride
[46:08] out of that church and remember this has
[46:10] been 55 years ago
[46:12] over over 55 years ago
[46:15] a church out of a church members of
[46:18] every denomination making up a bride
[46:20] a bride tree it's in the tapes of the
[46:22] bridegroom the bot
[46:23] the bride coming out called that's the
[46:26] one
[46:26] the bride tree rather is the one that's
[46:29] going to be in the rapture
[46:32] that alone nothing but the bride
[46:35] the elected ones known by god from the
[46:38] beginning
[46:39] amen the elected ones known by god
[46:43] from the beginning amen the spiritual
[46:46] father that is predestined and put the
[46:49] spiritual gene of god
[46:51] in each individual those are the ones
[46:53] that god has chosen
[46:55] those are the ones that will be in this
[46:57] rapture that will be
[46:58] in this uh in this catching away
[47:02] now malachi 4 uh it was difficult to get
[47:07] to malachi 4 without going back to uh
[47:10] first thessalonians to get into a whole
[47:12] another part i wanted to
[47:13] but we'll we'll skirt that because i i i
[47:17] plan to take the lord willing a whole
[47:19] service or maybe more
[47:20] on that shout and that voice in that
[47:22] trunk right amen
[47:24] i really want to get in to break those
[47:26] down a little bit if we can
[47:27] but we'll skirt it just a little bit
[47:29] because malachi 4
[47:31] 5 puts us in that position amen
[47:35] of that shout right praise the lord of
[47:37] that shout we just read about
[47:39] the lord shall descend what first with a
[47:41] shout
[47:42] yeah right amen uh that that is the
[47:45] message
[47:46] amen i don't mean to be contrary but it
[47:49] is
[47:49] the message not a message but the
[47:52] message what's that message
[47:53] that's jesus christ coming to a bride
[47:56] for this last day
[47:57] yes speaking his word letting himself be
[48:00] made known
[48:01] through that word again speaking back
[48:03] and revealing itself to his children
[48:06] amen malachi 4 behold i will send you
[48:09] elijah the prophet before the coming of
[48:12] the great and dreadful day of the lord
[48:15] now we know that there's those five
[48:17] comings of that spirit of elijah elijah
[48:20] elisha john the baptist brother branham
[48:23] and
[48:24] revelation 11. but
[48:27] so many times even in schofield notes
[48:30] here
[48:31] he gets those things scrupled up a
[48:33] little bit
[48:34] because in the header of i've got here
[48:36] that elijah he's referring to revelation
[48:39] 11.
[48:40] but what he's skipping is the the elijah
[48:43] that's to come at the end of the day
[48:45] before the great and dreadful day of the
[48:48] lord
[48:49] notice this the bible says that this
[48:51] elijah is to come
[48:53] before the great and dreadful day of the
[48:56] lord
[48:56] right amen not after but before
[49:00] and that elijah was to do like verse six
[49:03] said he shall turn the hearts of the
[49:05] fathers to the children that was john
[49:07] the baptist
[49:08] that elijah coming john the baptist
[49:11] that message which is christ
[49:15] speaking forward amen you get that
[49:19] and john the baptist the message of john
[49:21] the baptist
[49:22] was speaking forward it was it was
[49:25] turning the fathers to the children
[49:28] amen so that's a that's a speaking
[49:30] forward that's a bringing a message
[49:32] a truth that's looking forward from the
[49:35] from the fathers
[49:36] to the children amen that was john the
[49:39] baptist
[49:40] jesus told his disciples in matthew 10
[49:42] that very thing
[49:43] which we might go to in a minute if i
[49:45] don't have it down but we might can go
[49:47] to that
[49:48] and just just lay that out a little bit
[49:50] better but
[49:51] jesus even refers to to malachi 3
[49:55] and this malachi 4 6 the beginning of it
[49:58] but it's a split scripture as we know
[50:00] many scriptures are
[50:02] malachi 4 6 refers to
[50:06] the beginning refers to john the baptist
[50:08] whose message turned the father's hearts
[50:10] to the children
[50:11] and amen and the heart of the children
[50:14] to their fathers that's the second
[50:16] coming
[50:17] or well technically that would be the
[50:19] fourth coming of that spirit of elijah
[50:21] the second part of this bi uh part of
[50:24] this scripture
[50:25] see because now that message of the last
[50:28] day
[50:29] is to the children of the fathers
[50:31] looking back
[50:32] amen going back to the faith of those
[50:35] fathers
[50:36] see so when john the baptist message was
[50:39] a message preaching forward
[50:41] for the fathers to look unto the
[50:43] children now the message of this last
[50:46] day
[50:46] this malachi 4 5 4 6
[50:49] the end of it is looking from the
[50:51] children back to the fathers
[50:54] amen to restore back or to bring back
[50:58] from there
[50:59] by their hearts as it says here let's
[51:01] not uh
[51:02] turn the hearts of the children to their
[51:04] fathers well what lies in that heart
[51:06] that heart is the heart of faith that
[51:09] faith is what's being restored
[51:11] amen the faith is being restored back to
[51:14] the children
[51:15] of what was in the apostolic fathers yes
[51:19] as we look uh look back at the apostolic
[51:22] section down through the church ages
[51:25] this
[51:25] last day message was to not give
[51:28] something that was outside the scripture
[51:31] it wasn't to give something in this last
[51:33] stage for a bride
[51:34] that that was that was outside the word
[51:37] it was something of the word that was to
[51:39] bring revelation
[51:40] so that we could grasp the vision of
[51:43] what god has done
[51:44] doing and going to do yes but it's the
[51:48] faith
[51:49] amen the faith remember what he said
[51:52] if if uh
[51:55] that spirit falls a paraphrasing here
[51:58] like it did on the day of pentecost what
[52:01] happened on the day of pentecost
[52:03] when the spirit fell on the day of
[52:05] pentecost those men went out from that
[52:07] upper room
[52:08] and wrote a book of acts with the
[52:11] miracles that happened
[52:12] in their lives with the miracles that
[52:15] took place and
[52:16] and the the the spirit moving and all of
[52:19] the
[52:19] people being filled with the holy ghost
[52:21] and and god's moving and god's spirit
[52:24] being able to move
[52:25] freely amongst the people baptizing him
[52:29] feeling them miracles happening
[52:33] god just that book of that's realizing
[52:35] how that spirit's moving
[52:37] well that same thing was to be restored
[52:40] for this day
[52:42] it was to restore back the faith amen
[52:45] and that's exactly what he did
[52:47] it brought by the word of faith to a
[52:50] bride
[52:51] because remember the word comes
[52:54] when the word speaks when when the word
[52:57] is heard
[52:58] and it here and you hear back from that
[53:00] word is when it reveals itself to you
[53:03] it makes itself known to you see and
[53:06] that's
[53:07] that's where god was to reveal himself
[53:10] through this last day truth to this last
[53:13] day message
[53:14] to unveil the mysteries that were hid
[53:17] from ages and generations
[53:19] so that this bride would have something
[53:22] for this last day
[53:23] that no other age has had because
[53:27] something has got to be accomplished in
[53:29] this last age
[53:30] spiritually that has never been
[53:32] accomplished in every other
[53:34] age and that is a rapture of a group of
[53:37] people
[53:37] amen a rapture of the bride of jesus
[53:40] christ
[53:41] it's not been accomplished from the
[53:43] church of first church age till today
[53:46] but it's going to be it's going to be
[53:49] yes
[53:50] and god's going to accumulate all that
[53:52] up into this last time
[53:54] god's going to take them all together to
[53:55] make up from the again from the feet to
[53:57] the crown of the head
[53:58] make up the body of christ for that
[54:00] rapture yes
[54:01] amen he's bringing them all together
[54:03] thus
[54:04] i believe i believe
[54:08] that this this end time
[54:12] last day bride
[54:16] alive and remain group will hear this
[54:19] message
[54:21] now i know there's people that'll be
[54:23] contrary to that i know there's people
[54:24] that'll disagree with me on that
[54:27] but i believe the bride of jesus christ
[54:29] is going to hear this message
[54:32] the bride that is raptured or alive and
[54:34] remain grouped in this last age
[54:36] that is caught away by a body change is
[54:39] going to hear
[54:40] this word they're going to hear this
[54:42] message
[54:43] they're going to know this word to be
[54:45] the truth they're going to know it
[54:46] because that's what changes them is that
[54:50] word is what changes them
[54:52] now that's not to displace those people
[54:54] back there
[54:55] see because they had when they received
[54:58] their message
[54:59] it put them in that body they were just
[55:01] as predestinated as the rest of us
[55:04] but this last day has got to bring forth
[55:07] a word
[55:08] bride amen and the only way it can bring
[55:10] forth the word bride
[55:12] is if they receive the word of their
[55:14] hour amen
[55:16] and to me that's the only ones that are
[55:18] gonna that are gonna make it so
[55:19] the ones that's going to be there yeah
[55:21] and if you're one of those ones
[55:24] speaking uh parenthetically i guess or
[55:27] uh maybe even rhetorically speaking
[55:32] believing we all are but in a general
[55:34] sense
[55:36] if you are then you then god will lead
[55:38] you that
[55:39] that word will cross your path amen amen
[55:43] that message that truth that word of the
[55:46] hour will come
[55:47] across your path if you were meant to
[55:49] get it
[55:50] every one of us in here today except for
[55:53] maybe the young ones
[55:55] who've heard it from their parents but
[55:58] every one of us adults will say
[56:01] probably have a different story to tell
[56:04] about how we came to know this word to
[56:07] be the truth
[56:08] about how we came into this message and
[56:11] how we come to understand that this
[56:13] prophet was the last a prophet
[56:15] and to know that this word was the word
[56:17] of god that come for this last day
[56:19] to bring a bride to a place of rapturing
[56:22] faith
[56:23] by the word of god we'll probably all
[56:25] have different stories
[56:27] you go around the world and ask
[56:28] different ones you probably have
[56:30] thousands or hundreds of thousands of
[56:33] stories of how
[56:34] different ways god brought each one in
[56:38] yes i remember reading one time or
[56:40] hearing a testimony one time
[56:43] about uh and i think i may have told you
[56:46] this but
[56:46] in a third world country he goes into an
[56:49] open-air restroom to relieve himself
[56:52] and he's sitting there and the only
[56:54] thing to
[56:55] uh uh to to help after relieving himself
[56:59] was a piece of paper
[57:02] it was a half a sheet of paper the end
[57:04] of a book
[57:06] that probably about that size maybe not
[57:08] even that big
[57:10] and at the bottom of that was left what
[57:13] was said at the bottom of that page
[57:15] one page one half a page
[57:18] of a message book people have been using
[57:22] it to
[57:22] wipe themselves with a message book
[57:26] you think oh that's so horrible is so
[57:28] degradable
[57:29] would you put one there if you believed
[57:31] that someone was going to read it and
[57:33] that they were going to get saved
[57:34] because of reading that
[57:36] right i would you say oh i wouldn't do
[57:39] that
[57:40] i wouldn't put the message book there
[57:41] i'd put something else well that little
[57:43] half a page of books saved that man's
[57:45] soul
[57:47] he read that he contacted found out
[57:50] where it came from
[57:51] and and is serving the lord last i heard
[57:54] he was serving the lord filled with the
[57:56] holy ghost
[57:58] from a half a page yeah that's all it
[58:01] took
[58:02] man friend no matter where you are if
[58:04] you belong to him
[58:05] you're going to come to this word you're
[58:07] going to come to this truth you're going
[58:08] to know
[58:09] this and it's going to be revealed to
[58:11] your heart you're going to know
[58:12] it's god doing it because it's god
[58:14] orchestrating it friend
[58:16] there's none of us i don't care what
[58:17] greater novel writer there is
[58:19] could never write a story like this
[58:22] right
[58:23] none of them could have even even
[58:25] remotely enough
[58:26] imagination to write a story that god
[58:28] writes out as he plans it and brings it
[58:30] past in every one of our lives
[58:34] around the world there's not a
[58:37] novelist known to man that could write
[58:38] the stories that god writes
[58:40] right and how this come to pass and how
[58:42] this happens
[58:43] how this comes and brings this out but
[58:46] even the children
[58:47] even the young ones even my children you
[58:50] can raise them in the nurturing
[58:51] admonition of god but friend there comes
[58:53] a time when they've got to do it on
[58:55] their own
[58:55] that's right yes when they have got to
[58:58] accept it for themselves
[58:59] when they have got to be baptized with
[59:01] the holy spirit and fill with the spirit
[59:03] of god
[59:04] amen it has to come their time no matter
[59:07] what we do
[59:08] it's got to be their time and a lot of
[59:10] times even if they're led in that
[59:12] direction
[59:13] they come to it with a different
[59:15] experience yes
[59:17] amen well the difference with my mom and
[59:20] dad
[59:20] yeah but mom and dad can't get you there
[59:23] that's right
[59:24] what happened to you after that point
[59:26] that convinced you or showed you
[59:28] that he was the one that this was the
[59:31] word
[59:32] that this was the truth what was it it
[59:34] was more something it had to be
[59:36] something more mom and daddy that's
[59:37] right yeah
[59:38] it had to be right or you're still lost
[59:40] friend
[59:41] like there had to be a god somewhere
[59:43] that come in
[59:44] and evolved himself in your life to make
[59:46] you know that it was
[59:47] him that was calling you not mom and dad
[59:49] right right
[59:51] amen how many times
[59:55] how many ways thus i will reiterate and
[59:59] i will let tell you
[1:00:01] my opinion i believe that those who come
[1:00:05] in and this last day and this
[1:00:07] this alive remain rapture group is going
[1:00:10] to come in contact with this word
[1:00:12] with this message they're going to yes
[1:00:14] amen they're going to believe it
[1:00:16] amen that that's that's my uh that's my
[1:00:19] belief
[1:00:20] and it i i believe my belief is
[1:00:22] scripturally based
[1:00:24] i i believe it's uh founded in the word
[1:00:27] yeah
[1:00:28] in the scripture i believe it's the
[1:00:30] truth
[1:00:31] now this this word this message
[1:00:35] uh we'll go to matthew chapter 10
[1:00:37] because i just
[1:00:38] i didn't write this down but i feel like
[1:00:40] i need to i need to speak this
[1:00:43] to to back up if if you will
[1:00:47] uh malachi 4 5 and 6.
[1:00:50] mostly six malachi 3 we know
[1:00:53] is the voice of one crying in the
[1:00:54] wilderness well we know john the baptist
[1:00:56] identified himself as that part of the
[1:00:58] scripture
[1:00:59] as the voice of god crying in the
[1:01:01] wilderness
[1:01:02] but what is not told by john the baptist
[1:01:05] is malachi 4
[1:01:07] 6. now we know malachi 5
[1:01:10] uh we know malachi 4 and 5 could not
[1:01:13] have been john the baptist
[1:01:14] because he didn't come before the great
[1:01:16] and dreadful day of the lord
[1:01:18] right i mean he came before but 2 000
[1:01:21] years before that's not a before
[1:01:24] amen he did not forerun
[1:01:27] that great and dreadful day of the lord
[1:01:29] right that's right
[1:01:31] that had to be a different elijah well
[1:01:33] it could be the elijah of revelation 11
[1:01:36] because the great and dreadful day of
[1:01:37] the lord was already in progress and
[1:01:40] almost drawn to an
[1:01:41] end right yes because
[1:01:44] a revelation 11 is is at the towards the
[1:01:47] end of the tribulation period
[1:01:49] right well the great and dreadful day of
[1:01:51] the lord
[1:01:52] the sixth seal the tribulation breaking
[1:01:55] out of this world
[1:01:57] is if that great and dreadful day is
[1:02:00] before
[1:02:00] revelation 11. you understand
[1:02:04] because see this and this gets me into
[1:02:06] so many things that
[1:02:08] that take this into a different light
[1:02:11] but
[1:02:12] look friend when god
[1:02:16] when god calls his bride for this last
[1:02:19] day when god
[1:02:20] calls this gentile bride he takes her to
[1:02:23] a marriage supper
[1:02:25] a wedding supper the wedding supper of
[1:02:27] the lamb the marriage supper of the lamb
[1:02:30] of revelation 19.
[1:02:33] we go to that marriage supper amen
[1:02:36] at that marriage supper there's three
[1:02:38] and a half years there according to the
[1:02:40] scripture
[1:02:41] of the bride there with the lord jesus
[1:02:45] well then god then puts her in the
[1:02:48] palace while he comes
[1:02:49] back to reveal himself to the jews yes
[1:02:52] when he comes back to reveal himself to
[1:02:54] his people
[1:02:55] yes well that's at the end of the three
[1:02:58] and a half year tribulation period
[1:03:01] so this great and dreadful day cannot be
[1:03:04] this elijah cannot be revelation 11
[1:03:07] because that's at the end
[1:03:09] of the great and dreadful day right this
[1:03:12] great and dreadful day jesus spoke of it
[1:03:15] matthew chapter 10
[1:03:18] or 17 excuse me it's not matter
[1:03:23] 17
[1:03:28] here we go this is what i'm looking for
[1:03:33] now the mouth transfiguration is taking
[1:03:35] place they come out
[1:03:37] god tells them not to tell this vision
[1:03:39] to anyone
[1:03:40] but then in the 10th verse his disciples
[1:03:43] asked him
[1:03:44] saying why then say the scribes that
[1:03:48] elias
[1:03:49] must first come jesus answered and said
[1:03:52] unto them
[1:03:53] elias truly shall come
[1:03:56] shall first come so you notice jesus
[1:04:00] says
[1:04:01] he will come
[1:04:04] and restore all things now
[1:04:08] if he was talking of john the baptist
[1:04:10] there
[1:04:11] what did john the baptist restore
[1:04:16] nothing right john the baptist had one
[1:04:20] simple task right and that was
[1:04:22] forerunning
[1:04:24] and introducing the first christ
[1:04:27] corporal body on this earth yes that was
[1:04:30] his only job
[1:04:31] that was his only task now he did a lot
[1:04:33] of preaching and he baptized a lot of
[1:04:35] people
[1:04:36] but he only baptized them onto
[1:04:38] repentance
[1:04:40] the true christian baptism wasn't
[1:04:42] introduced until acts 2
[1:04:43] 38. that's right when peter came and
[1:04:47] said be baptized in the name of the lord
[1:04:49] jesus christ
[1:04:52] so yes john baptized but he just
[1:04:54] baptized unto repentance
[1:04:56] right amen his job was to introduce
[1:05:00] jesus christ
[1:05:01] and when he did he said i must decrease
[1:05:05] now so that he increased yes you know
[1:05:08] where john the baptist ended up in
[1:05:09] prison got his head chopped off
[1:05:11] because his job was over he had done
[1:05:13] what he was supposed to do
[1:05:15] brother brown talked about him like a
[1:05:17] wild man coming out with locusts and
[1:05:19] honey dripping off his beard
[1:05:20] and he'd preach the dust that the lord
[1:05:22] gave him and he'd go back in the woods
[1:05:25] so he said i wish sometimes he said he
[1:05:28] wished he could do that
[1:05:29] just live out in the woods and come out
[1:05:31] like say when i got dust said the lord
[1:05:33] said thus saith the lord and go back in
[1:05:34] the woods
[1:05:37] and that's kind of and that's what john
[1:05:38] the baptist was right
[1:05:40] now could you imagine today in our
[1:05:43] sophisticated religious system that
[1:05:45] we've got
[1:05:46] and our big huge beautiful buildings
[1:05:48] with stained glass windows and
[1:05:50] and cross crowned steeples that if
[1:05:53] the man like john the baptist would have
[1:05:55] walked out of the wilderness here
[1:05:57] with thus saith the lord and declare it
[1:05:59] on the six o'clock news
[1:06:00] do you think anybody would pay that man
[1:06:02] any attention right
[1:06:04] the first chance they had they'd throw
[1:06:06] him in
[1:06:07] and non-existent mental institution
[1:06:12] that's exactly what they do they would
[1:06:15] pay a bit attention to him for nothing
[1:06:17] but he's the one with thus saith the
[1:06:18] lord right he is the third
[1:06:21] spirit of the coming of elijah amen
[1:06:25] and when they and those but see those
[1:06:27] who were not
[1:06:28] ordained to hear that did not hear it
[1:06:32] only the ones that were ordained to hear
[1:06:35] john the baptist's message
[1:06:37] and to accept the first coming of christ
[1:06:39] are the ones that did
[1:06:42] they were the only ones listen
[1:06:45] you know we don't like to put it this
[1:06:47] way but it's the truth
[1:06:48] they were the only ones that could hear
[1:06:52] that's right what john the baptist's
[1:06:54] message was yes
[1:06:55] they were the only ones that could hear
[1:06:57] it
[1:06:58] but when they saw it and they ran after
[1:07:01] jesus
[1:07:02] amen that he said i must decrease now
[1:07:04] there's people that stay back with john
[1:07:06] the baptist
[1:07:07] we know later in the bible they talk
[1:07:08] about john's disciples
[1:07:11] even after jesus was there and even
[1:07:13] after his ministry was going forth
[1:07:15] there were still people that stayed
[1:07:16] loyal to john the baptist
[1:07:19] that's the same thing we got today
[1:07:20] friend there's people out there that
[1:07:23] they
[1:07:24] they bleed brown and blue
[1:07:28] that's just the fact and that's just the
[1:07:30] way they're going to be
[1:07:32] right and and i'm not saying those
[1:07:34] people don't know or won't be there
[1:07:36] that's that's up to god that's his
[1:07:38] decision
[1:07:38] that's his choice who goes and who don't
[1:07:40] go that's his choice not mine
[1:07:42] right that's his decision not mine i
[1:07:44] don't choose it i just preach what the
[1:07:46] bible says
[1:07:47] amen we can draw conclusions about what
[1:07:49] the bible says
[1:07:50] but i'll never put anybody in and i'll
[1:07:52] never take anybody out
[1:07:54] that's a period i don't care who they
[1:07:55] are i don't care if they're
[1:07:57] mass murderers friend they could be
[1:08:00] sitting there getting ready to hit the
[1:08:02] electricity and they could repent
[1:08:04] and that last breath they could repent
[1:08:08] amen i'll take anybody in oh put anybody
[1:08:11] in i don't take anybody out that's god's
[1:08:13] doing
[1:08:14] right not mine amen but the word tells
[1:08:17] us
[1:08:18] exactly how it was supposed to be and
[1:08:20] jesus tells him
[1:08:22] yes elijah will come and he is going to
[1:08:25] restore
[1:08:26] all things well john the baptist did
[1:08:29] restore anything
[1:08:30] he was not a restoration prophet he was
[1:08:34] a
[1:08:34] word prophet that come with just said
[1:08:36] the lord amen and when he introduced
[1:08:38] jesus
[1:08:39] he was gone amen
[1:08:43] when he introduced jesus and and it was
[1:08:45] all about christ
[1:08:47] amen should be that way today yes amen
[1:08:50] it should be that way today it should
[1:08:52] all be about jesus
[1:08:53] right it's all about christ amen amen
[1:08:56] that's the way it should be
[1:08:57] now let's finish reading elias truly
[1:09:00] shall first come
[1:09:01] and restore all things so he couldn't
[1:09:03] have been talking about john the baptist
[1:09:05] right right
[1:09:06] but i say unto you that elias has come
[1:09:09] already
[1:09:10] there's another one of those dual
[1:09:11] scriptures right that elias has come
[1:09:14] already and they knew him
[1:09:15] not but have done unto him whatsoever
[1:09:18] they listed
[1:09:19] likewise shall also the son of man
[1:09:22] suffer of them
[1:09:23] now he's talking about john the baptist
[1:09:25] now he's telling him
[1:09:26] yes there is an elijah coming yes and
[1:09:30] he's going to restore all things
[1:09:32] but i'm telling you that elijah has
[1:09:34] already come
[1:09:35] and they did whatever they wanted to to
[1:09:37] him
[1:09:39] they treated him whatever way they
[1:09:40] wanted to throwing him in prison
[1:09:42] chopped his head off and then he said
[1:09:45] and they'll do the same thing to the son
[1:09:47] of man
[1:09:48] jesus they'll do the same thing to me is
[1:09:52] what he's telling them
[1:09:53] now then the word says the disciples
[1:09:55] understood he spoke of john the baptist
[1:09:57] well the second part of it
[1:09:58] was but not the first part because john
[1:10:01] didn't restore anything
[1:10:02] so you got to keep the scripture running
[1:10:04] in continuity if it doesn't fit the word
[1:10:07] it can't it can't work right it doesn't
[1:10:11] work if it's
[1:10:12] not scriptural leave it alone yes just
[1:10:15] like in malachi 4
[1:10:16] 5 and 6 malachi 6 john the baptist
[1:10:21] from the from the fathers to the
[1:10:23] children
[1:10:25] brother adam from the children to the
[1:10:27] fathers
[1:10:28] it was to restore a faith to restore a
[1:10:32] faith
[1:10:33] well if that faith got restored restored
[1:10:37] amen restored then what would that
[1:10:40] produce
[1:10:42] well what did it produce the first time
[1:10:45] a book of acts
[1:10:48] amen now understand something
[1:10:51] because a lot of people get that part
[1:10:53] confused they say well it's going to
[1:10:55] produce a book of acts
[1:10:56] and it is that's right it is i
[1:10:59] contend that it is not will
[1:11:02] it is producing a book of acts yes
[1:11:06] if we know enough about what the spirit
[1:11:08] of god is doing in the world today
[1:11:10] amongst his children we will say that
[1:11:13] miracles are taking place and god is
[1:11:15] producing a book of ox
[1:11:17] all over again but i want you to
[1:11:19] understand the differences here
[1:11:21] in the first church age when they were
[1:11:23] producing a book of acts they were once
[1:11:26] again
[1:11:27] being produced on looking forward
[1:11:32] that's not what we're doing today the
[1:11:35] book of acts today
[1:11:36] is a book of acts that's going to finish
[1:11:39] this
[1:11:40] and end it there wasn't an end
[1:11:43] after the first book of acts there was a
[1:11:46] continuation
[1:11:47] the purpose and point of god gathering
[1:11:50] his children from all over the world
[1:11:52] by the word of god and the truth of his
[1:11:54] word and the spirit of god being
[1:11:55] manifested
[1:11:56] but in this last day that spirit is
[1:11:59] lifting
[1:12:00] off the gentile bride going back to the
[1:12:02] jews
[1:12:03] and this book of acts is going to end it
[1:12:07] not beginning yes and a lot of times we
[1:12:09] get those two things misunderstood
[1:12:11] yeah we think would be just exactly like
[1:12:13] a book of acts no it won't
[1:12:15] it won't be exactly like the book of
[1:12:17] acts it'll be a book of
[1:12:19] acts in theory but it won't be exactly
[1:12:21] like the book of acts
[1:12:22] because what they were doing was
[1:12:24] baptizing people getting filled with the
[1:12:26] holy ghost and miracles and things
[1:12:28] taking place
[1:12:28] and all going forward from the first
[1:12:31] church age
[1:12:32] right but friend what's happening today
[1:12:34] is we're just we're gleaning at best
[1:12:36] now are there any more souls out there i
[1:12:40] don't know
[1:12:41] i believe there is and i'm going to keep
[1:12:43] preaching and living and witnessing like
[1:12:45] there are
[1:12:46] but that's up to the lord but we know
[1:12:48] that this end time is coming down to a
[1:12:50] time
[1:12:51] to where the door on the ark is going to
[1:12:53] be shut yes
[1:12:54] and there'll be no more souls can get in
[1:12:56] or out yeah oh everybody be going on
[1:12:58] like normal
[1:12:59] right just like they were with noah in
[1:13:01] the flood
[1:13:02] when god shut the door it was a whole
[1:13:04] seven days before
[1:13:06] anything ever happened yes people are
[1:13:09] going to their jobs
[1:13:11] just like they normally do
[1:13:14] going about their daily business
[1:13:16] probably see the ark over the side and
[1:13:18] they might yell out of
[1:13:20] explicitly to to knowing his family or
[1:13:24] or or make fun of them or laugh or
[1:13:27] joke at them oh no where's the rain
[1:13:30] today
[1:13:32] i'm off to work i gotta go do my daily
[1:13:35] business
[1:13:36] but noah you look silly in that ark
[1:13:38] aren't you hot in there
[1:13:41] i tell you what friend if we were hot if
[1:13:43] we were in there this week
[1:13:44] we would have been hot brother roger dug
[1:13:48] a ditch friday
[1:13:49] it was hot it's been hot all week but
[1:13:53] we're still alive
[1:13:54] we still made it there's still air
[1:13:57] conditioning and power
[1:13:58] so we we made it again much as we all
[1:14:01] love it
[1:14:02] tongue and cheek but can you imagine
[1:14:06] sitting in the ark there and these
[1:14:08] people coming by making fun and laughing
[1:14:10] at it
[1:14:12] maybe even some come even like the bible
[1:14:14] says when the rain started no
[1:14:16] let us in i can't let you in the gods
[1:14:18] shut the door i can't open it
[1:14:21] amen but there's a period of time where
[1:14:24] life's going to continue to go on and
[1:14:25] everything's going to be just like
[1:14:27] normal the bride's going to be sealed
[1:14:29] into the kingdom
[1:14:31] and there's no more souls going to be
[1:14:32] saved at that point
[1:14:34] amen no more souls personally
[1:14:37] i think i've told you all this
[1:14:39] personally i believe that's going to be
[1:14:40] the period of time between
[1:14:42] when the dead in christ rise and we
[1:14:44] actually go to meet the lord of the air
[1:14:46] that's my opinion now it may already be
[1:14:49] underway i don't know
[1:14:50] you can listen to brother brown on tape
[1:14:52] but he says could it already be
[1:14:54] yes right but we don't know and that's
[1:14:56] 60 years ago
[1:14:57] yes could it be could it be now it could
[1:15:00] be
[1:15:01] i don't think so i hope it's not
[1:15:04] but it could be whether it is there
[1:15:06] isn't there's going to be a time
[1:15:08] and you see that's the time that we're
[1:15:10] in now we're not in the first church age
[1:15:12] anymore
[1:15:14] we're not in that book of acts this is a
[1:15:17] finishing
[1:15:18] up book of acts this is a this is a
[1:15:21] spark of faith
[1:15:23] like the book of acts that's going to
[1:15:25] take a
[1:15:26] a bride into a body change for a rash
[1:15:31] and end it that's going to end right
[1:15:33] there
[1:15:35] the gentile dispensation done
[1:15:38] yes when this bride leaves the gentile
[1:15:40] dispensation
[1:15:41] is done my wife even remarked this
[1:15:44] morning and you probably feel the same
[1:15:46] way and have felt the same thing
[1:15:48] at that spirit of god moving off the
[1:15:50] bride
[1:15:52] lifting off the bride as we see
[1:15:55] god's still moving in our midst and all
[1:15:57] the things that he does for us
[1:15:59] but it just isn't what it used to be
[1:16:01] friend it's not what it's not what it
[1:16:03] was when i
[1:16:03] first came into this when i first
[1:16:05] started preaching 33
[1:16:07] 34 years ago it was nothing like it is
[1:16:10] today
[1:16:11] nothing like it is i was telling my wife
[1:16:13] yesterday we've seen the rise in the
[1:16:15] fall of the mall
[1:16:17] the shopping mall people don't hardly go
[1:16:19] to them anymore
[1:16:20] i remember when they were first being
[1:16:22] built
[1:16:23] used to be the time that that was the
[1:16:25] only place people went to shop that was
[1:16:27] the number one the premier place
[1:16:29] you went to shop but now it's like
[1:16:31] non-existent anymore
[1:16:32] oh we have one here and there but at the
[1:16:35] foothills mall's basically gone el
[1:16:37] connie is gone
[1:16:38] his shopping centers amen it's just
[1:16:41] that the the changing of the times
[1:16:44] is so fast anymore so drastic
[1:16:48] amen we've seen the disappearance of the
[1:16:50] woman bun
[1:16:51] and the appearance of the quote-unquote
[1:16:54] man bun
[1:16:57] which to me is in contrary terms but
[1:16:59] anyway
[1:17:01] right it's it's just how fast things are
[1:17:04] going
[1:17:05] how quick things are moving to even now
[1:17:08] like i said things it's just not like it
[1:17:11] used to be
[1:17:12] right and that and it's different in the
[1:17:14] south i i'll give you that but even when
[1:17:16] i go back there it's not the same as it
[1:17:18] knows
[1:17:18] it's not oh my friend i used to i told
[1:17:21] i've told you before i used to attend
[1:17:23] meetings sometimes
[1:17:24] you know church maybe two or three times
[1:17:26] this long and be in the back and you
[1:17:28] couldn't even see the pulpit hardly for
[1:17:30] the
[1:17:31] milkiness of the spirit and god's so
[1:17:33] thick in a place
[1:17:35] and the moving of the spirit moving i
[1:17:37] could have started a bobby pin factory
[1:17:39] of the sisters
[1:17:40] dancing in the spirit and the bobby pins
[1:17:42] all over the carpet when church was over
[1:17:44] amen i've been there i've seen it
[1:17:48] god's spirit moving god hasn't changed
[1:17:51] us what's changed
[1:17:54] amen look we're at that time and that's
[1:17:58] the point i'm trying to make see
[1:17:59] we're at that time look what uh look
[1:18:02] what he said on the attraction on the
[1:18:04] mountain
[1:18:07] he's talking about this the spirit that
[1:18:10] paralyzed
[1:18:11] parallels uh elijah turning the hearts
[1:18:14] of the children he's
[1:18:16] going through that with the malachi 3
[1:18:18] and 4. he said now watch
[1:18:20] in the hearts of the children to the
[1:18:22] fathers in his second
[1:18:24] coming which is now we're looking to
[1:18:26] that second coming of christ
[1:18:28] which his second coming we always call a
[1:18:31] coming but
[1:18:32] but we literally go to meet him
[1:18:36] amen we know he comes we know he
[1:18:38] descends
[1:18:39] but we are raptured up to meet him in
[1:18:42] the air amen
[1:18:43] amen a lot of songs i've heard and sang
[1:18:46] through the years and
[1:18:47] they just don't have the scriptural
[1:18:49] validity they used to
[1:18:50] because it really isn't god is not going
[1:18:53] to
[1:18:54] god's not going to ever come put his
[1:18:56] foot on this earth again until it gets
[1:18:57] purified
[1:18:58] cleaned over burned over amen that's a
[1:19:02] whole other section uh
[1:19:05] turning the hearts of the children to
[1:19:07] the fathers in his second coming in the
[1:19:09] last days
[1:19:10] that's today he turns back to the
[1:19:13] apostolic
[1:19:14] faith again amen apostolic
[1:19:17] faith again well it's got to be that way
[1:19:20] it's got to be that faith to cause this
[1:19:22] bride to go on a rapture
[1:19:24] so it's now when you bring the faith the
[1:19:25] word
[1:19:27] the truth of god all comes and and and
[1:19:30] comes together it forms that perfect
[1:19:33] union
[1:19:34] amen and that perfect union friend is is
[1:19:37] what i
[1:19:37] what i wanted to get to next uh we just
[1:19:40] don't
[1:19:41] have the time to start into it right now
[1:19:43] that's a whole other message
[1:19:44] as we get into it maybe lord willing
[1:19:46] next week but now notice this as we
[1:19:48] close this out
[1:19:50] this message today it's not about
[1:19:53] arguing quotes
[1:19:54] it's not about arguing doctrines it's
[1:19:57] not about who's right and who's wrong
[1:19:59] it's about restoring faith it's about a
[1:20:02] word to bring a people
[1:20:04] back to that same faith that they had
[1:20:06] then
[1:20:07] plus the introducing of the mysteries
[1:20:10] being revealed of the word
[1:20:11] jesus opening himself to his pride
[1:20:14] making himself
[1:20:15] known which oh my wants me to go into
[1:20:17] that next part so bad
[1:20:20] jesus revealing himself making himself
[1:20:24] known to his bride
[1:20:26] he's not doing it to the world he's
[1:20:27] doing it to his bride
[1:20:29] amen
[1:20:32] a bride and a bridegroom get married
[1:20:34] they become husband and wife
[1:20:36] and when they go into the secret chamber
[1:20:38] they reveal themselves to each other
[1:20:41] right oh my god i
[1:20:44] but look before
[1:20:48] jesus let's just talk about the story of
[1:20:50] joseph for a moment
[1:20:52] we know that joseph was sold by his
[1:20:55] brothers
[1:20:57] he was put in slavery uh
[1:21:01] he ascended to the second most powerful
[1:21:04] person on the earth
[1:21:06] he was given a gentile bribe by pharaoh
[1:21:10] and he had half jew and half gentile
[1:21:12] children
[1:21:14] and when and when jacob came to
[1:21:17] uh ephraim and manasseh he crossed his
[1:21:21] hands for the blessing
[1:21:23] because the right hand blessing always
[1:21:25] went to the older son
[1:21:27] because he received the older son he
[1:21:29] received that
[1:21:30] that inheritance that inherited blessing
[1:21:33] by the right hand to ephraim or manasseh
[1:21:38] but forget now the older boy
[1:21:41] when jacob went to bless the boys his
[1:21:44] hands crossed
[1:21:46] and jacob tried or uh joseph tried to
[1:21:48] move his hand said
[1:21:49] said father father no you've got it
[1:21:51] wrong because see jacob was blind at
[1:21:52] this time couldn't see
[1:21:54] and and he tried to know father you've
[1:21:56] got your hand on the
[1:21:57] right hand on the younger boy he says
[1:21:59] god crossed my hands right that's right
[1:22:02] yes
[1:22:02] amen so the blessing went
[1:22:05] from the tame olive tree to the wild
[1:22:09] olive tree
[1:22:10] from the older inherited son to the
[1:22:13] younger
[1:22:14] gentile if you will through the cross
[1:22:19] the blessing left and went from the jew
[1:22:22] to the gentiles that's right
[1:22:24] and when joseph went to reveal himself
[1:22:27] to his brethren
[1:22:28] he had to dismiss his gentile wife
[1:22:32] he had to get rid of everything and
[1:22:34] everybody
[1:22:36] uh genesis chapter 45. if you want to
[1:22:38] read it
[1:22:39] but you know what we can read it i i
[1:22:43] have a couple more minutes
[1:22:46] genesis 45 1.
[1:22:49] but joseph had to dismiss his gentile
[1:22:52] wife
[1:22:53] he had to put her in a separate chamber
[1:22:56] before he could reveal himself to his
[1:22:58] brethren
[1:23:00] jesus has got to take his bride into a
[1:23:03] rapture
[1:23:04] and have a wedding supper with her
[1:23:07] amen and at the end of the wedding
[1:23:10] supper
[1:23:12] he is to pull her away and he comes down
[1:23:15] to his children
[1:23:16] to the jews and he reveals himself to
[1:23:19] them
[1:23:20] and we've said this many times they look
[1:23:23] at him and they lament and they warn and
[1:23:25] they say
[1:23:26] where do you get those scars he said in
[1:23:27] the house of my friends
[1:23:30] their eyes are open remember what the
[1:23:34] block was
[1:23:35] that kept the children of israel from
[1:23:37] seeing jesus
[1:23:40] you remember what we told you what was
[1:23:42] the block what was the
[1:23:44] what was the film that was drawn over
[1:23:48] the
[1:23:48] the jews eyes so they didn't see him
[1:23:51] when he came the first time
[1:23:54] they were looking for him in a different
[1:23:55] way right
[1:23:57] their mind was so fixated on what god
[1:24:00] was going to do by the torah that they
[1:24:02] completely
[1:24:03] missed their their savior coming out of
[1:24:06] the doorpile
[1:24:07] right they were so blinded by their own
[1:24:10] ambitions and by their own
[1:24:12] doctrines oh god's got to do it this way
[1:24:16] no he doesn't he's only got to do it
[1:24:19] according to what his word says he's
[1:24:21] going to do it
[1:24:22] not your interpretation of the word not
[1:24:25] your vision of the word not what you
[1:24:27] think the word says
[1:24:28] or anybody or any doctor of divinity
[1:24:31] he's going to do it the way he wants to
[1:24:32] do it yes
[1:24:33] he's going to do it when he does when he
[1:24:36] does and how he wants to do it
[1:24:38] that's his choice amen i just want to
[1:24:41] believe him
[1:24:42] i just i just want to be ready and i
[1:24:44] want to be one of the ones he does the
[1:24:46] two
[1:24:46] yeah but when he dismisses them then he
[1:24:50] comes and reveals himself to his brother
[1:24:53] and they finally they have no
[1:24:55] inhibitions anymore
[1:24:57] they have no vision of what it's
[1:24:58] supposed to be or what's going to take
[1:25:00] place
[1:25:01] all that is gone because we've gone
[1:25:03] through the tribulation period in
[1:25:04] revelation 11
[1:25:05] and they realized they had crucified the
[1:25:08] very messiah that they had been looking
[1:25:09] for
[1:25:10] yes oh my but friend they're going to be
[1:25:13] reconciled then
[1:25:14] that's their reconciliation once they
[1:25:17] see him
[1:25:18] they'll be reconciled the bride will be
[1:25:20] tucked away she's already gone to
[1:25:21] rapture three and a half years
[1:25:23] earlier she's already in the chamber see
[1:25:26] amen
[1:25:26] but look in in genesis 45 1
[1:25:31] then joseph could not refrain himself
[1:25:33] before
[1:25:34] all them that stood by him and he cried
[1:25:38] caused every man he says to go out from
[1:25:41] me
[1:25:42] and there stood no man with him while
[1:25:45] joseph made himself known unto his
[1:25:47] brother
[1:25:48] amen that's why
[1:25:52] that's why the spirit of god is lifting
[1:25:55] off the gentiles
[1:25:56] yes amen yes yeah probably answered that
[1:26:00] 60 years ago or more that it was lifting
[1:26:03] then if it was lifting then where is it
[1:26:06] today
[1:26:08] but it's going back to identify itself
[1:26:10] with the jews and god begins to work
[1:26:12] with the jews
[1:26:13] the jews will accept the message the
[1:26:15] jews will receive the message
[1:26:17] but who is the message the message is
[1:26:20] christ
[1:26:21] christ is the word that is the message
[1:26:24] i think sometimes people got so confused
[1:26:26] to think that that the jews were going
[1:26:28] to receive brother branham's message
[1:26:30] brother branham's message wasn't for the
[1:26:32] jews
[1:26:33] it was for the that elijah calling
[1:26:37] wasn't to be
[1:26:38] sent for the jews it was sent for the
[1:26:40] gentiles
[1:26:41] that wasn't for what they were supposed
[1:26:43] to receive but they're going to receive
[1:26:46] the message and the message is jesus
[1:26:48] christ amen
[1:26:50] and they will receive it yes sir amen no
[1:26:53] way by me or you
[1:26:54] they will receive it yes they will
[1:26:57] believe it
[1:26:58] amen amen oh friend it becomes so
[1:27:01] beautiful
[1:27:02] clear how god works his work
[1:27:06] and how scruple up people can get how
[1:27:08] what do we say a couple weeks ago how
[1:27:10] misunderstood right people can become
[1:27:14] just by a simple tweaking of something
[1:27:16] quote or scripture or something or
[1:27:18] misunderstanding or misinterpretation
[1:27:21] you want to talk about misunderstanding
[1:27:24] what do you think is going to happen to
[1:27:26] this in this message when brother billy
[1:27:28] paul passes away what do you think's
[1:27:32] going to happen
[1:27:33] now look me personally and i hope you
[1:27:36] too
[1:27:37] aren't hinging on billy paul being an
[1:27:39] old man right
[1:27:40] no i'm not you know why
[1:27:44] because he is an old man i don't know
[1:27:48] how much older than 83 84 you have to be
[1:27:51] to be
[1:27:51] considered old that's old scripturally
[1:27:56] and that's old naturally
[1:28:01] remember one thing when brother brown
[1:28:04] went beyond the curtain of time
[1:28:06] who's the first one he saw sharon rose
[1:28:09] right she didn't recognize her i was
[1:28:12] your little sharon rose on the earth
[1:28:14] all praise the lord mom's waking up
[1:28:16] waiting for you up at the house
[1:28:18] amen this chair that got repossessed in
[1:28:21] there and dog is
[1:28:22] it's all in there all that he loved
[1:28:26] but dad i'm gonna go down here and wait
[1:28:28] for billy paul
[1:28:30] wait for billy paul now if billy was
[1:28:34] going
[1:28:35] i'm sorry and i hope i don't offend
[1:28:37] anybody
[1:28:38] on this video or but if he was supposed
[1:28:41] to make
[1:28:42] the rapture as alive and remain why
[1:28:44] would sharon rose go wait for him
[1:28:48] wouldn't she see him in the rapture as
[1:28:51] one of the dead that would raise first
[1:28:54] and appear unto many yeah exactly
[1:28:57] wouldn't she i would think so
[1:29:01] who else is left here if if she
[1:29:04] resurrected
[1:29:05] who else would be lived here that's
[1:29:07] alive here that would go to but she'd go
[1:29:10] to billy paul
[1:29:12] just like our son would go to my go to
[1:29:14] my wife
[1:29:16] or us if we're together i think he'd go
[1:29:19] to her first but
[1:29:20] amen that's this is father's day so i'm
[1:29:23] gonna
[1:29:24] he's gonna come to me first today only
[1:29:26] special he's gonna come and beat her
[1:29:30] but every other day is mother's day
[1:29:33] but wouldn't that be the way i mean just
[1:29:35] imagine i'm not preaching doctrine here
[1:29:37] and i'm not trying to talk
[1:29:39] into something or produce something
[1:29:40] that's you know
[1:29:42] this is not anything our salvation or
[1:29:44] the rapture's hinged on
[1:29:46] that's just my opinion that's just my
[1:29:48] feeling but what would
[1:29:50] what would happen if or when that does
[1:29:53] happen
[1:29:54] because there's people i'll tell you
[1:29:56] it's out there that will they will
[1:29:57] fight you to the death that billy paul
[1:30:00] is not an old man
[1:30:01] because of that testimony that's not
[1:30:04] even on tape
[1:30:06] i believe it but it's not even on pain
[1:30:09] amen so we're not here arguing doctrines
[1:30:12] we're not
[1:30:12] the message didn't come to argue
[1:30:14] doctrines it didn't come to
[1:30:16] to fuss about a quote here and there
[1:30:18] amen scruple things up but
[1:30:22] what all does that do right all we we
[1:30:24] know all that does is create confusion
[1:30:26] right
[1:30:26] right amen all it does is create
[1:30:28] confusion
[1:30:30] and and i and i don't say this to create
[1:30:32] confusion right amen
[1:30:34] i don't want there to be any confusion
[1:30:35] out there and those people who believe
[1:30:37] that and feel that way god bless them i
[1:30:39] love them they're my brothers
[1:30:41] i pray and trust we all go together
[1:30:44] right
[1:30:44] amen i just happen to see it a little
[1:30:46] differently than they do
[1:30:47] right when will billy paul not be an old
[1:30:50] man
[1:30:51] in the resurrection praise the lord yes
[1:30:56] amen i don't know
[1:31:00] praise the lord anyway joseph revealing
[1:31:04] himself to his brothers
[1:31:06] and he second verse and he wept aloud
[1:31:08] the egyptians the house of pharaoh heard
[1:31:10] and joseph said to his brother
[1:31:11] i am joseph that my brother my father
[1:31:15] yet live and his brother could not
[1:31:16] answer him for they were
[1:31:18] troubled at his presence jose and you go
[1:31:20] and read
[1:31:21] zechariah into different places you'll
[1:31:22] see a lot of the same that happened to
[1:31:24] joseph
[1:31:25] actually does happen at that time when
[1:31:28] god when jesus reveals himself
[1:31:30] to his brother and joseph said unto his
[1:31:32] brother come near to me i pray you and
[1:31:34] they came near and he said i
[1:31:35] am joseph your brother whom you sold
[1:31:38] into egypt
[1:31:39] now therefore be not greed nor angry
[1:31:42] with yourselves can you just imagine
[1:31:46] that you saw me hither for god did send
[1:31:49] me before you
[1:31:50] to preserve life
[1:31:54] whose life did he preserve
[1:32:01] because they were blind because they did
[1:32:04] do what they did to to him
[1:32:06] he could preserve life amen life
[1:32:09] of millions down through the church ages
[1:32:11] yes
[1:32:12] up to this last time that culminates in
[1:32:14] this rapture
[1:32:16] all that life was preserved because of
[1:32:19] what they did
[1:32:20] now the sins got to be reconciled and it
[1:32:22] will be we've read that we talked about
[1:32:24] that a few weeks ago
[1:32:25] it will be and they realize what they
[1:32:28] did
[1:32:29] and they repent and put on sackcloth and
[1:32:31] ashes and they repent
[1:32:33] amen and and then they realize who what
[1:32:36] they did
[1:32:37] they realized that they crucified their
[1:32:39] very messiah
[1:32:40] amen next
[1:32:44] i want to focus on that invisible union
[1:32:48] amen amen that invisible union
[1:32:54] still a little controversial for some
[1:32:56] people and maybe
[1:32:58] some things i see differently than some
[1:33:01] people see it
[1:33:02] and i can't help that right uh i just
[1:33:05] preach it the way the lord shows it to
[1:33:07] me and
[1:33:08] um and you know
[1:33:12] that's all i can say that's all i can
[1:33:14] say that's all i mean
[1:33:16] amen the lord shows it and he vindicates
[1:33:19] it by his word
[1:33:20] and that's where i stand that's what i
[1:33:23] believe
[1:33:24] amen joseph revealed himself to his
[1:33:27] brothers
[1:33:28] he dismissed his gentile bride amen this
[1:33:30] bride's going into rapture friend
[1:33:33] and at the end of the wedding supper
[1:33:35] he's going to come and reveal himself to
[1:33:37] his
[1:33:37] to his brother amen to his to to his
[1:33:41] friends
[1:33:41] to the jews you know might have sang
[1:33:44] that song and
[1:33:45] uh i'm not going to get into that but
[1:33:49] that song i was listening to one time
[1:33:51] coming down from the mountains
[1:33:54] uh spoke to me one time because i began
[1:33:57] to wonder
[1:33:58] uh i'm closing here as i begin to wonder
[1:34:01] um
[1:34:03] how could we be children
[1:34:08] and a wife
[1:34:11] you ever thought of that how are we a
[1:34:14] bride
[1:34:15] and a children at the same time
[1:34:18] my bride is right there my children are
[1:34:20] right here they're
[1:34:21] completely separate different
[1:34:23] individuals right
[1:34:25] amen you ever thought about that
[1:34:29] i did oh it came on my heart so thick
[1:34:32] that and i was coming down and i heard
[1:34:33] that song
[1:34:34] because of the words in the song son go
[1:34:37] get your children my children i don't
[1:34:39] know how the words go
[1:34:41] and then it and then it hit where the
[1:34:44] children of god
[1:34:46] but were the bride of jesus christ
[1:34:49] amen now you don't separate them into
[1:34:52] two individuals
[1:34:53] they're still the one person right amen
[1:34:56] but
[1:34:57] just like brother baron said i'm a
[1:34:58] person i'm a human
[1:35:00] i'm a i'm a husband i'm a father
[1:35:04] but it's just me right amen
[1:35:07] god is god father son holy ghost he is
[1:35:11] god
[1:35:12] amen i'm human being i'm i'm father i'm
[1:35:15] son i'm i'm i'm a husband
[1:35:19] but see i don't i don't serve the same
[1:35:21] purpose to my children as i serve to my
[1:35:23] wife
[1:35:24] i don't serve the same purpose to my
[1:35:26] wife or my children as i do to my
[1:35:27] grandchildren
[1:35:28] i don't serve the same purpose and then
[1:35:30] that i serve years faster than this
[1:35:31] church
[1:35:32] right you understand and it becomes so
[1:35:34] clear i thought praise the lord
[1:35:36] that's it that's how we are bright and
[1:35:38] children at the same time we're the
[1:35:39] children of god we're the bride of jesus
