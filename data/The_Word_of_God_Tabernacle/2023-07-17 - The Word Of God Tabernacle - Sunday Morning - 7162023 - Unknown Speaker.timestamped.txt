[23:59] uh to mention to you that I have written
[24:02] down it was uh sister brother Pat had
[24:05] texted me a little earlier
[24:07] and said that sister Pat was having a
[24:09] lot of pain
[24:10] having trouble resting sleeping so
[24:14] please remember sister Pat prayer this
[24:15] morning
[24:18] she's having quite difficulty in pain
[24:22] please remember her amen
[24:26] I had a rough week myself this last
[24:28] week's probably the worst week I've had
[24:30] since I've been working that job uh
[24:33] over 70 hours worked over 15 hours
[24:36] Friday uh eating dinner at 10 o'clock at
[24:39] night going to bed at 11 or 12 or I
[24:42] think Friday night I didn't even go to
[24:43] bed until about almost one o'clock
[24:45] fortunately though Saturday I drove so
[24:48] Saturday I could sleep as late as I
[24:50] needed to
[24:51] before the drive yesterday but I don't
[24:54] mind admitting as a 57 year old it took
[24:57] a toll out of me so amen but the Lord is
[25:00] good and I appreciate the Lord's
[25:02] blessings amen
[25:04] press through it and do what's necessary
[25:07] to continue to serve him as we do as
[25:10] I've said and as I preach we do as unto
[25:13] the Lord amen everything we do we do we
[25:16] done to him praise the Lord
[25:18] amen so that's the only prayer request I
[25:20] had here does anyone else have a
[25:22] something on your heart

[25:31] shoulder and a lot of shoulder and we
[25:34] prescribe something but

[25:43] to tell her I'll take care of it I'll do
[25:45] it and um just we need to remember her
[25:48] in prayer as the Lord delivered from
[25:50] that pain
[25:52] I think yes praise the Lord
[25:54] that prayer

[25:59] [Music]
[26:01] yes
[26:03] um they especially at my apartment
[26:05] complex
[26:06] seen a lot more homeless people
[26:09] having problems like where did they go
[26:13] and this morning I found a piece of
[26:17] cardboard on my grill
[26:19] and I saw a lady Dustin herself off and
[26:23] took off
[26:24] apparently she probably stayed right
[26:27] there
[26:29] and seeing it more happened even in
[26:31] other parts of my apartment accomplished
[26:34] yeah to pray for the homeless that they
[26:37] start Sheltering because it's just heat
[26:41] even just not just Sawyer it's all over
[26:44] the United States yeah
[26:46] devastating

[27:06] going to be 110. that's just that's just
[27:09] the way it is in Tucson I've been here

[27:15] summer in July it's 110 plus
[27:18] I've played golf at 114 I've been out at
[27:23] 117 one time it was like really hot in
[27:26] the 80s
[27:27] so it is hot but there are people that
[27:30] are suffering as a result of it so
[27:33] pray that the monsoon relief is coming
[27:36] soon it rains three or four nights in El
[27:40] Paso while we were there so their
[27:42] Monsoon was already starting to kind of
[27:44] unfold so that's a good sign for us
[27:47] because it just kind of moves
[27:49] back from there as it comes out and kind
[27:51] of sweeps across us you know most of our
[27:54] clouds come from the southeast so it's
[27:56] that's gone a good sign is it's going to
[27:59] be hitting us pretty soon so and with
[28:01] the heat the eats what draws it into so

[49:06] gathered in your name you'd be there in
[49:07] the midst we know you to be here today

[49:12] necessarily but because we know the
[49:14] promise of your word guarantees us that
[49:17] you would be here because we are not
[49:19] here in the name of a man we are not

[50:54] time is right at hand so grant us your
[50:57] grace once again for services we
[50:58] committed to you in the name of the Lord
[51:00] Jesus Christ we pray amen amen Genesis
[51:04] chapter 3 verse 21.
[51:08] scripture says and unto Adam also and to
[51:12] his wife did the Lord God make coats of
[51:14] skins and clothe them you could be
[51:17] seated if you'd like
[51:19] amen
[51:20] we started this scripture
[51:24] uh every service here on the subject
[51:27] that we've been on for the past six
[51:28] weeks now this would be the seventh
[51:31] um would you recognize that the Lord's
[51:33] the one that started this uh and was the
[51:36] one who put it in motion to begin with
[51:38] excuse me
[51:40] amen when he spoke back here even in
[51:42] Genesis chapter 3.
[51:45] it was God's the one that took the
[51:47] sheepskin and slew them and threw the
[51:50] sheepskin in amen the bloody sheepskin
[51:52] for Adam and Eve to wear that they would
[51:54] be able to come out into God's presence
[51:56] again but I want to go over to Ephesians
[51:59] chapter 1. uh and continue our thought
[52:02] for today the last two Services we've
[52:05] been dealing with the last well this
[52:07] would be the Holy Spirit part seven the
[52:09] last couple of services have been about
[52:11] the false anointed ones today I want to
[52:14] talk about the holy spirit being the
[52:16] Seal of God Amen the Holy Spirit uh
[52:19] being the Seal of God Amen Ephesians
[52:22] chapter 1 verse 13 we'll read a couple
[52:25] of scriptures here to draw our context
[52:27] from today
[52:29] chapter one
[52:31] verse 13 let's read here
[52:34] in whom ye also trusted after that ye
[52:38] heard the word of Truth The Gospel of
[52:40] your salvation in whom also after that
[52:43] ye believed ye were sealed with the Holy
[52:47] Spirit of promise
[52:48] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[52:51] until the Redemption of the purchased
[52:54] possession unto the praise of his glory
[52:57] each almost every word that we just read
[53:00] could take a week of ministering because
[53:03] it's so much that's involved in what and
[53:06] what Paul is telling the mature Ephesian
[53:09] church about the Holy Spirit and
[53:12] speaking to us today about the
[53:15] importance of the Holy Spirit and and
[53:17] what is is involved the necessity of the
[53:21] Holy Spirit and also being the earnest
[53:23] which we know is just simply a down
[53:25] payment remember we talked about that
[53:27] Holy Spirit and of course the the on and
[53:30] the end part of the Holy Spirit the
[53:32] anointing of the Holy Spirit the
[53:34] indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit
[53:36] or the New Birth uh that that uh
[53:39] presence of that Spirit uh being being
[53:42] now we see the actual seal that seals
[53:46] your soul amen that is the down payment
[53:49] it is simply what it takes to get us to
[53:53] where we want to go amen notice when you
[53:57] buy a house and you put down earnest
[53:58] money an earnest money is simply a down
[54:01] payment if you buy a car you put down
[54:03] earnest money or you put down a down
[54:05] payment the down payment is simply
[54:08] something to get you in the car a down
[54:10] payment is simply something to put you
[54:12] in the house amen but thank God we know
[54:16] that that Earnest is only what we need
[54:18] to put down because he made the rest
[54:21] amen he paid the price praise the Lord
[54:24] so and send us back the earnest which is
[54:27] the earnest of our inheritance until the
[54:30] Redemption of the purchase possession
[54:33] and to the praise of his glory which we
[54:35] could go back in Romans 8 but that's not
[54:37] our subject today of the uh of the
[54:39] Redemption of the purchased possession
[54:41] the Final Redemption is to take place
[54:43] with this bride when she goes home to be
[54:45] with him amen we've already been
[54:47] redeemed we've been redeemed by the
[54:49] blood of the lamb but the finalization
[54:51] of that Redemption is when this bride
[54:53] goes home to be with him amen again of
[54:56] Romans 8 23 tells us about that but now
[54:58] let's look at this seal for a few
[55:00] moments uh when you've heard the word of
[55:03] Truth The Gospel of your salvation in
[55:05] whom also after that ye believe ye were
[55:09] sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise
[55:11] so we see here that the holy spirit is
[55:14] actually to seal himself amen the Holy
[55:18] Spirit himself is this seal praise the
[55:22] Lord let's go over one more scripture
[55:24] before we continue on chapter four
[55:26] Ephesians still in Ephesians chapter 4.
[55:31] verse 30.
[55:34] amen Ephesians 4 30.
[55:37] it says it grieved not the holy spirit
[55:40] of God whereby ye are sealed until the
[55:44] day of redemption amen where is brother
[55:47] ran him put it into your final
[55:48] destination amen until we reach the part
[55:52] of the place of the purpose of being
[55:54] sealed by the holy spirit so in this
[55:57] Holy Spirit now is of course thought to
[55:59] be grieved is what is the seal that
[56:02] seals us now the point of the ceiling uh
[56:06] don't necessarily need to bring it back
[56:07] over but again you can see the the
[56:10] little crew drawing of the Body Spirit
[56:12] Soul it's the soul that's been sealed
[56:14] amen the soul that's been sealed what is
[56:17] a seal what's the purpose of a seal amen
[56:21] as we know what a seal is the the seal
[56:25] is several things when when God sent the
[56:28] Holy Spirit uh on the day of Pentecost
[56:31] obviously we spoke the Holy Spirit came
[56:34] on them and they were filled amen so
[56:39] this the Holy Spirit itself in our lives
[56:43] serves a multitude of purposes it
[56:46] signifies a multitude of things and it's
[56:50] that that that signifies and identifies
[56:53] who you are in Christ that's why the
[56:56] holy spirit is is the essential thing
[57:00] that you have to be able to belong to
[57:02] God to go in a Rapture not not a water
[57:06] baptism that leads us to that not even
[57:09] our repentance which leads us to the
[57:11] baptism but it's the Seal of the holy
[57:14] spirit that proves who you are in him
[57:17] amen and that's our token that's what
[57:19] gets us to our final destination amen we
[57:23] are sealed until our final destination
[57:26] but the seal has a multitude of purposes
[57:30] look here even in the natural we'll talk
[57:33] some spiritual natural but the seal
[57:36] itself to think of what a seal is a seal
[57:38] is a substance that joins two things
[57:42] together amen a seal is something that
[57:45] can bring and actually join two things
[57:48] together
[57:50] vulcanized even if you will or where the
[57:53] two become one you can take two
[57:56] substances and you can seal them
[57:58] together to where the two substances
[58:01] actually join together in their
[58:03] molecular structure you can put heat on
[58:06] something to the place that actually to
[58:09] the anybody ever uh uh uh fixed the tire
[58:13] uh I have uh it used to be an old-time
[58:17] wave out now they just use a plug or
[58:20] glue or something but where they would
[58:22] actually take Heat and they would take a
[58:24] patch and I've done my bicycle tire like
[58:27] this when I was a kid and take enough
[58:29] heat and take a rubber patch and a
[58:32] rubber tire so you have to have the
[58:34] light substance and you put enough heat
[58:36] on it and the two substances actually
[58:39] come in to be one substance they come
[58:43] into one being one thing sealing the two
[58:46] together which seals the hole in the
[58:48] tire amen the two actually come together
[58:52] to be one friend when the Holy Ghost and
[58:54] Fire come down and sealed you with the
[58:57] Holy Spirit of promise if seal the holy
[59:00] spirit in you and make you and him one
[59:04] amen it made you and him one that's why
[59:08] the world is not supposed to be able to
[59:10] tell the difference between you and
[59:12] Christ
[59:13] they know there's something wrong with
[59:15] you they know there's something
[59:17] different wrong Oddball whatever want to
[59:20] call it today amen but they know there's
[59:22] something different they might not
[59:23] realize what it is but it's the fact
[59:25] that the two have become one
[59:27] the substances amen the word and the
[59:31] word the Holy Spirit seals to do
[59:32] together praise the Lord makes them one
[59:35] the seal is a substance that would join
[59:38] two things together praise the Lord it
[59:42] made him brother Adam says when Heaven
[59:45] and Earth embrace one another when he
[59:48] came and he put his own life in you and
[59:51] sealed his life in you with his life and
[59:55] made you and him one
[59:57] remember the body the spirit's temporal
[1:00:00] they're just here contacting the world
[1:00:02] see taste Phil smell here uh imagination
[1:00:05] fiction constant reason memory is those
[1:00:08] things that contact the world but the
[1:00:10] soul is what we're concerned about the
[1:00:12] soul is what God's concerned about the
[1:00:15] soul is what belongs to God which lives
[1:00:18] on which goes to its final destination
[1:00:21] amen is the soul of man so it's the soul
[1:00:24] that God he had joined the two together
[1:00:26] the seal joins the two together
[1:00:30] a seal is also to protect anything from
[1:00:35] passing in between the two substances a
[1:00:39] seal keeps it like the tire the tire
[1:00:42] sealing together kept any air from
[1:00:45] leaking back out right right amen it
[1:00:48] kept any water or anything else from
[1:00:51] coming in
[1:00:53] the seal protected
[1:00:55] anything from passing between the two so
[1:00:59] a seal actually stops uh uh anything
[1:01:03] from going back and forth when God seals
[1:01:06] the holy spirit in your soul
[1:01:09] he seals God in and the devil sealed out
[1:01:13] so when this seal
[1:01:15] brings the two together he stopped it
[1:01:19] stops the devil from having any claims
[1:01:22] whatsoever to your soul
[1:01:24] he stops him from having any access to
[1:01:28] your soul he can't even touch your soul
[1:01:30] anymore the only thing the devil can do
[1:01:32] at that point when you've been born
[1:01:35] again the Holy Spirit and fires come out
[1:01:38] and burn that old nature out and put his
[1:01:41] own nature in you the only thing the
[1:01:44] devil can touch about you is your body
[1:01:46] or your human spirit
[1:01:47] that's the only thing he can have access
[1:01:49] to anymore because when God sealed you
[1:01:52] with his Spirit he sealed the devil out
[1:01:55] and he disallowed any passage of the
[1:01:59] devil to come and have any influence on
[1:02:01] your soul anymore which is the nature of
[1:02:04] your spirit
[1:02:05] your soul is the nature of your spirit
[1:02:06] so if your soul is of God then nature is
[1:02:10] going to affect what your spirit does
[1:02:13] your spirit is the life of the body
[1:02:16] which is going to affect how you react
[1:02:18] or act on the outside
[1:02:20] so so literally the inside of the inside
[1:02:24] is what controls even your spirit and
[1:02:27] your body because your soul is the
[1:02:28] nature of the spirit spirits of nature
[1:02:30] of the body the life of the body so One
[1:02:33] controls the other then to the other
[1:02:36] so when God did that now when he did
[1:02:39] when he sealed you and he disallows by
[1:02:43] that seal the devil to ever come and
[1:02:46] penetrate that Soul anymore that also
[1:02:49] tells us that the Holy Spirit according
[1:02:51] to what we just read has sealed you in
[1:02:54] there and no longer leaves
[1:02:57] it does not lead
[1:02:58] a lot of people look I believe again I
[1:03:01] may have got this from the Armenians
[1:03:03] they think you can be saved one day and
[1:03:05] lost the next
[1:03:06] or
[1:03:08] in speaking of salvation
[1:03:10] but
[1:03:12] to be when you're born again
[1:03:16] that finalizes and you're sealed with
[1:03:19] the spirit of God that finalizes you
[1:03:21] until your destination amen there's no
[1:03:24] more doubt there's no more wrestling
[1:03:26] there's no more wondering amen
[1:03:30] when the devil shelled out God sealed in
[1:03:33] God's not going anywhere Saints you
[1:03:35] don't you don't you're not born again
[1:03:37] one day and lost the next right
[1:03:40] right it doesn't work that way if God
[1:03:43] comes and seals you with his Spirit you
[1:03:45] are sealed what the scripture say you
[1:03:48] are sealed until your final destination
[1:03:51] amen you are sealed until God takes you
[1:03:54] home amen what was it
[1:03:57] you are sealed
[1:03:59] unto the day of redemption
[1:04:02] praise the Lord or as like you said
[1:04:04] brother Barham said to you reach your
[1:04:06] destination
[1:04:07] and this is not our destination we're
[1:04:09] sojourners here we're pilgrims here
[1:04:12] we're strangers in a Strange Land here
[1:04:15] we don't belong here not in this world
[1:04:17] Cosmos amen this world this Earth
[1:04:20] belongs to us they don't know it but it
[1:04:22] does but this world Cosmos we don't
[1:04:25] belong here we're pilgrims our
[1:04:27] destination is heaven all right our
[1:04:30] destination is permanent residence with
[1:04:33] the Lord Jesus Christ yes amen so not
[1:04:36] only does it stop the devil from coming
[1:04:38] and having influence on your soul
[1:04:40] anymore but it also
[1:04:42] it also lets us know that we are sealed
[1:04:45] that God the holy spirit is sealed in
[1:04:48] there the person of Jesus Christ sealed
[1:04:51] in there until we're out of this world
[1:04:54] it'll no longer leave there's no passage
[1:04:57] again that's the point no passage
[1:04:59] between the two once this is once it has
[1:05:02] been sealed
[1:05:04] a seal signifies that a price has been
[1:05:08] paid
[1:05:09] amen when something when a price gets
[1:05:12] paid for something they'll that used to
[1:05:14] be they would use a seal they don't
[1:05:15] really do that anymore but when you pay
[1:05:18] the price or or when when uh uh the uh
[1:05:24] the price was met when the cost was met
[1:05:27] there would be a seal put on there to
[1:05:30] show that hey look my fare has been paid
[1:05:33] here I have the ticket I had the token I
[1:05:36] have I have the stamp whatever it was to
[1:05:39] prove a seal that proves that I I paid
[1:05:42] the price the price has been paid now of
[1:05:44] course we didn't pay the price he paid
[1:05:46] the price the Lord Jesus Paid the price
[1:05:48] not me but that seal by his purchase
[1:05:52] purchased us to him which signified that
[1:05:55] we had been bought with the price
[1:05:58] and our PRI and the price was the blood
[1:06:00] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ yes
[1:06:03] amen and the seal just signifies that I
[1:06:06] had been bought by him amen now if I've
[1:06:09] been bought by him then that means the
[1:06:12] seal must also show authentication or
[1:06:16] ownership
[1:06:19] the seal must also if the seal shows
[1:06:22] that a price has been paid then that
[1:06:25] also means that the seal proves
[1:06:27] ownership
[1:06:28] [Music]
[1:06:30] let's look at it real quick I got I
[1:06:33] wanted to read a scripture on this one
[1:06:34] that several of these you could go back
[1:06:36] and look at the scripture of many of
[1:06:38] these some of them I've had like I said
[1:06:40] temporal some of them are uh natural
[1:06:43] some scriptural second Timothy chapter
[1:06:46] two
[1:06:47] let's look at this real quick second
[1:06:49] Timothy chapter 2. we'll begin with uh
[1:06:53] verse 15.
[1:06:56] second Timothy 2 15.
[1:06:59] studied to show thyself approved unto
[1:07:02] God a Workman that needeth not to be
[1:07:06] ashamed rightly dividing the word of
[1:07:09] Truth amen now we know we've talked
[1:07:12] about that before that's the Holy Spirit
[1:07:14] that's that's God that's the Lord bring
[1:07:17] your Revelation into your heart into
[1:07:19] your life
[1:07:21] but Sean profane and vain babblings for
[1:07:25] they will increase unto more ungodliness
[1:07:29] and their word will eat as doth a canker
[1:07:33] of whom is hymenus hymenius and uh
[1:07:37] felicis
[1:07:38] who concerning the truth have aired
[1:07:42] saying that the resurrection passed
[1:07:44] already and overthrow the faith of some
[1:07:46] so notice remember as we talked about
[1:07:50] last week well the last couple of
[1:07:52] services actually that we talked about
[1:07:54] that God allows the tares to grow with
[1:07:58] the wheat right amen God allows it
[1:08:01] he allows as uh Paul calls names amen
[1:08:07] we've said before uh we're probably a
[1:08:10] little more diplomatic about it but Paul
[1:08:12] was not Paul didn't care hold and pulled
[1:08:15] and he punches he called names when he
[1:08:17] saw somebody not preaching the truth of
[1:08:20] the revealed word of the hour he called
[1:08:22] them out and he called them by name and
[1:08:24] he's calling here by name I'm edius and
[1:08:28] Felicia's he's telling these two are not
[1:08:31] preaching the gospel
[1:08:33] he's letting us he's letting them know
[1:08:35] there which lets us know if there was a
[1:08:38] harmonious and a felicus then trust me
[1:08:41] Saints there's high medius and Felicia's
[1:08:43] today
[1:08:45] amen that are not preaching the pure
[1:08:48] Gospel of the reveal word of the hour
[1:08:50] they're not
[1:08:51] amen that just it just tells us that
[1:08:53] scripture because concerning the truth
[1:08:56] they have aired Paul says saying that
[1:09:00] the resurrection is passed already and
[1:09:02] overthrow the faith
[1:09:04] the faith of some gets overthrown it
[1:09:08] didn't say listen now these people who
[1:09:11] may be going astray a little bit down a
[1:09:15] path that's not the pure word
[1:09:18] even that it just says it over through
[1:09:21] their faith it did not say they were
[1:09:23] lost
[1:09:24] understand it does not say that it does
[1:09:27] not say they are Eternal Doom they might
[1:09:29] be don't know it just says that they've
[1:09:32] aired from the faith
[1:09:34] praise the Lord now when someone's aired
[1:09:38] from the faith that doesn't mean that
[1:09:39] they can't come back
[1:09:41] doesn't mean that they are lost it just
[1:09:45] means that at least at least for a
[1:09:48] temporary time the ministry of these two
[1:09:51] men have caused those people to believe
[1:09:54] something that is not scriptural
[1:09:57] and unfortunately that is that is the
[1:09:59] same thing happens today
[1:10:01] amen that people men
[1:10:04] will just say even women out in the
[1:10:06] world or ministering things outside the
[1:10:08] gospel of the pure word and is
[1:10:11] overthrowing the faith of people
[1:10:13] and they that and then they live
[1:10:16] usually defeated lives they don't know
[1:10:18] which way to
[1:10:20] work they're believing a false word but
[1:10:23] Paul is calling them by name I mean this
[1:10:25] is who concerning have overthrow the
[1:10:29] faith of some but listen this
[1:10:30] nevertheless
[1:10:33] the foundation of God standeth sure
[1:10:38] even if the tares are still growing with
[1:10:40] the wheat the foundation of God is still
[1:10:44] sure
[1:10:45] amen that does not change
[1:10:48] oh wait
[1:10:50] oh
[1:10:52] oh wheat does never becomes a tear right
[1:10:56] right
[1:10:58] the faith might be overthrown but a
[1:11:00] wheat will never be anything but a wheat
[1:11:03] right it cannot be
[1:11:05] conversely a terror can never be a weed
[1:11:10] right it can't right the seed itself
[1:11:13] that was planted produces what it is and
[1:11:17] who planted the devil right
[1:11:20] the devil planted his seed to be who it
[1:11:23] was when the serpent planted his seed in
[1:11:26] the Garden of Eden what did it produce
[1:11:29] It produced a cane what did Cain do he
[1:11:33] killed his brother right
[1:11:34] right which was of the evil one as the
[1:11:38] Bible says the wicked one the devil he
[1:11:41] did exactly what that spirit that seed
[1:11:44] in him caused him to do thus we have
[1:11:47] serpent seed even yet today and people
[1:11:50] say oh there's no such thing I'll show
[1:11:53] you exactly in the Bible where it talks
[1:11:55] about serpent seek if you say no serpent
[1:11:58] seed in the Bible you just don't know
[1:11:59] your Bible yes amen and this isn't one
[1:12:02] of those that we know by Revelation it
[1:12:05] literally actually in the Bible says
[1:12:07] serpent seed
[1:12:10] it does
[1:12:12] praise the Lord
[1:12:13] but a weed can never be anything but a
[1:12:17] week the foundation of God standeth sure
[1:12:21] he has every one in the palm of his hand
[1:12:24] and he cannot cannot listen things don't
[1:12:27] worry about your family
[1:12:28] every one
[1:12:30] God has in the palm of his hand and he
[1:12:34] cannot lose one right right I don't care
[1:12:37] if they've aired I don't care what
[1:12:38] they're going what it looks like in the
[1:12:41] palm of God's hand he cannot lose one

[1:16:07] vessels of gold and of silver but also
[1:16:11] of wood and of Earth

[1:16:36] dishonor in a gray house that's what it
[1:16:38] is raising together and that's what he's
[1:16:41] talking about I believe he's referring
[1:16:42] back to hymenius
[1:16:45] and what they're talking about but in
[1:16:47] the house of God now that belongs to God
[1:16:50] we belong to him that shows ownership we
[1:16:53] are in his house we're a part of his
[1:16:55] family praise the Lord that seal shows
[1:16:58] ownership
[1:16:59] look Also let's go back over
[1:17:02] well we'll just we already read it
[1:17:04] anyway in Ephesians
[1:17:07] amen signifies the price has been paid a
[1:17:10] seal also signifies a finished product
[1:17:14] amen when something's been finished
[1:17:16] it'll it'll it oftentimes it will be
[1:17:20] sealed with something whatever it is uh
[1:17:23] brother random talked about the railroad
[1:17:25] car when the the guy working the
[1:17:28] railroad car would go pack that thing
[1:17:30] just as perfect the way it's supposed to
[1:17:32] be the inspector would come by and he
[1:17:35] would look at that railroad car and he
[1:17:37] would inspect it to make sure it was
[1:17:39] packed properly so that all the packages
[1:17:42] that were inside the railroad car got to
[1:17:44] where they were going and got there
[1:17:46] safely yeah and when he looked at it and
[1:17:49] he approved it as being sufficient to be
[1:17:52] able to make its destination he put a
[1:17:55] seal on it right right and nobody was to
[1:17:58] break that seal right that seal was
[1:18:01] supposed to stay intact until that
[1:18:03] merchandise got to where it was going to
[1:18:06] its final destination
[1:18:08] amen it's show the finished product it
[1:18:12] showed that something was complete it
[1:18:14] was a completed job it was a completed
[1:18:17] work look friend when Jesus said be ye
[1:18:20] therefore perfect he wasn't meaning that
[1:18:22] you're going to be a sinless person he
[1:18:24] just meant that we need to be grown-ups
[1:18:27] that we need to be mature because the
[1:18:30] Redemptive price has been paid when God
[1:18:33] sealed you it signifies you're a
[1:18:35] finished work you belong to God in your
[1:18:38] soul now obviously we will continue to
[1:18:41] grow in Grace uh in our spirit our body
[1:18:44] the rest of our lives until the until
[1:18:47] the full payment of that Redemption that
[1:18:49] uh uh that full Redemption takes place
[1:18:52] and we receive a body change is going to
[1:18:56] be continuous growth but the seal says
[1:18:59] You Belong To Me
[1:19:01] the price has been paid this is a
[1:19:04] finished product so when you've been
[1:19:06] sealed by the holy spirit of God if
[1:19:08] you've received the new birth you
[1:19:10] recognize that God has has uh identified
[1:19:13] you as his and that you are a finished
[1:19:16] product in him you belong to him now
[1:19:20] praise the Lord a seal also represents
[1:19:23] Authority
[1:19:25] amen that puts you in a place of
[1:19:27] authority the Holy Spirit itself being a
[1:19:30] seal signifies the authority of whom the
[1:19:34] seal belongs to
[1:19:36] you'll never see well I shouldn't say
[1:19:39] never no never be unofficial speech by
[1:19:43] the president of the United States
[1:19:45] unless he's behind the podium with the
[1:19:49] Seal of the United States on the podium
[1:19:52] never now he might be walking to his
[1:19:54] helicopter or his plane or he might do
[1:19:57] some impromptu something but he never
[1:19:59] gives an official address to the public
[1:20:02] without being a Podium and a seal that
[1:20:05] through that signifies who he is right
[1:20:08] and anyone stands behind that seal that
[1:20:11] means they are representing the
[1:20:14] president they are speaking on behalf of
[1:20:16] the president whoever he is she whatever
[1:20:19] it it it it proves that's who they are
[1:20:22] that seal signifies The Authority from
[1:20:26] which they speak
[1:20:27] amen the Seal of the Holy Spirit In You
[1:20:30] signifies the authority of God from whom
[1:20:33] you speak
[1:20:34] I don't speak these things we don't
[1:20:37] speak these things of Our Own these
[1:20:39] things don't belong to us it's not ours
[1:20:41] we speak what God shows us or we keep
[1:20:45] quiet
[1:20:46] that's what brother Brandon said yeah
[1:20:48] yes amen this bride she will have thus
[1:20:51] saith the Lord or she will sit still Yes
[1:20:53] amen amen you will have thus saith the
[1:20:56] Lord from God or you will sit still
[1:20:58] that's an authority of God
[1:21:01] remember
[1:21:02] the character the the power without the
[1:21:06] character is satanic right
[1:21:09] right it takes the character of God the
[1:21:12] authority of God to prove who you belong
[1:21:14] to and of course the most important
[1:21:17] thing is that this seal of the Holy
[1:21:20] Spirit seals God in and seals the devil
[1:21:24] out right which we've already talked
[1:21:26] about no Passage through the Holy Spirit
[1:21:30] God himself in the person of Jesus
[1:21:34] Christ amen
[1:21:36] is sealed in the soul and there's no
[1:21:39] Passage
[1:21:40] pursued into your destination the devil
[1:21:42] can get in there God does not leave you
[1:21:45] amen it's at seal it's a seal that
[1:21:48] brings now there's been
[1:21:51] seals through the scripture you know
[1:21:54] before Pentecost before the Holy Ghost
[1:21:56] fell we have what we as know today as
[1:22:00] the holy spirit in our lives and and uh
[1:22:03] in the form of the holy Jesus Christ in
[1:22:05] the form of the Holy Spirit
[1:22:08] God moved on his people in different
[1:22:11] ways Pillar of Fire by the pillar of
[1:22:13] Fire by Night pillar of cloud by the day
[1:22:15] amen when God came and spoke to Abraham
[1:22:18] he did so with purpose look at this
[1:22:21] let's go to Genesis chapter 17.
[1:22:25] amen
[1:22:26] because there's there's something that
[1:22:30] is spoke of in the Old Testament that
[1:22:32] helps us recognize the Seal of the Holy
[1:22:36] Ghost of the New Testament
[1:22:43] let's look
[1:22:44] you're 17.
[1:22:49] Genesis 17 9.
[1:22:53] and God said unto Abraham Thou shalt
[1:22:56] keep my Covenant therefore thou and thy
[1:23:00] seed after thee and their Generations
[1:23:03] this is my Covenant look now this is God
[1:23:07] speaking to Abraham telling Abraham that
[1:23:11] this which he is about to announce
[1:23:14] this is my God's covenant
[1:23:19] which ye shall keep
[1:23:21] between me and you and thy seed after
[1:23:25] thee
[1:23:27] every man child among you
[1:23:30] shall be circumcised
[1:23:33] and ye shall circumcise the Flesh of
[1:23:35] your foreskin and it shall be a what
[1:23:40] exactly Ruth a token
[1:23:43] amen a touchy can't understand it yet
[1:23:46] but I understand what you're saying the
[1:23:48] token it's a token
[1:23:51] the the circumcision was a token a sign
[1:23:54] a signification of a token of a covenant
[1:23:59] between us and God
[1:24:01] that token proved that there was a
[1:24:03] connection there the connection that we
[1:24:06] have today that we call the Holy Spirit
[1:24:08] and a new birth
[1:24:10] God gave to Abraham as a seal of
[1:24:13] circumcision it proved something
[1:24:16] praise the lord it's not only
[1:24:19] differentiated them from the rest of the
[1:24:22] world but it proved their obedience to
[1:24:24] God and it shown that they belong to God
[1:24:28] praise the Lord it showed and proved
[1:24:31] ownership we trust God we believe God we
[1:24:35] are his children and we do this on
[1:24:37] obedience to his word that seal of
[1:24:40] circumcision every man to be circumcised
[1:24:44] now that circumcision was simply a token
[1:24:49] praise the Lord it was a token that
[1:24:51] showed that that seal between the two
[1:24:54] had been met the Seal of
[1:24:57] authentification uh between God and
[1:25:00] Abraham had been met because of this
[1:25:02] circumcision it sealed their Covenants
[1:25:06] between him and God remember God here
[1:25:09] said and it shall be kept between me and
[1:25:12] you
[1:25:15] me and you and your seat after you
[1:25:19] it's not for everybody

[1:25:27] it's not up to the the parents it's not
[1:25:31] up to the world it's between you and God
[1:25:34] it is an individual affair
[1:25:36] I don't get it
[1:25:38] uh my wife doesn't get it because of me
[1:25:41] or vice versa my children didn't get it
[1:25:44] because they came from my loins right
[1:25:46] they had to get it for themselves every
[1:25:48] individual has to have it by themselves
[1:25:52] it's an individual Affair your
[1:25:54] relationship with God is Not between you

[1:26:06] yes notice and it's sitting here in thy
[1:26:10] scene after thee what seed was that of
[1:26:12] course a natural seed but also a faith

[1:26:18] Abraham and those that follow along with
[1:26:21] the faith of Abraham receive
[1:26:23] circumcision as well

[1:26:34] human alike receiving by the Holy Spirit
[1:26:38] of circumcision in themselves

[1:26:43] a circumcision of the heart you go back
[1:26:46] in Romans 2 29. a circumcision of the
[1:26:50] heart that does what that Spirit Cuts
[1:26:52] away all of the world is Cuts away all
[1:26:55] of the unbelief Cuts away anything that
[1:26:58] is not like God and it makes that seal a
[1:27:02] covenant between you and God a
[1:27:05] circumcision that shows that even by
[1:27:08] faith because the only way you can have
[1:27:09] it is by faith
[1:27:11] you can't receive the Holy Spirit any
[1:27:14] other way but by faith and believing
[1:27:18] trusting knowing God's promise his word
[1:27:21] is delivered to you by faith that faith
[1:27:25] of Abraham
[1:27:26] brings that Covenant that token that
[1:27:30] seal that circumcision that that uh that
[1:27:34] promise that God has given to cut away
[1:27:37] everything that's not like God
[1:27:40] what does it do it identifies you to him
[1:27:43] it separates you from the world it makes
[1:27:47] you and him in perfect relation together
[1:27:50] it brings you and him together as one
[1:27:54] what did we talk about the other day

[1:28:04] yeah she's become the work he's the work
[1:28:06] the only way he can join together with
[1:28:08] anything is it has to be word
[1:28:11] amen you don't have relation uh
[1:28:16] man and animal
[1:28:18] producing Offspring no it takes a man
[1:28:21] and a woman it takes two humans
[1:28:25] it takes word and word to become one to
[1:28:28] produce and that production brings forth
[1:28:31] life
[1:28:32] and life proves that Covenant that
[1:28:35] Covenant this watch between us and him
[1:28:37] yeah you personally
[1:28:39] personally between you the circumcision
[1:28:41] let's go over to Romans because Roman
[1:28:43] talks now Paul talks about it to the
[1:28:45] Roman Church
[1:28:49] Romans chapter 4 verse 9.
[1:28:53] amen
[1:28:55] Romans 4 9.
[1:29:05] cometh this blessedness
[1:29:07] then upon the circumcision only look at
[1:29:10] now if it's some of the writings here uh
[1:29:15] can become tricky so we'll read it
[1:29:17] slowly
[1:29:18] cometh this blessedness
[1:29:21] then upon the circumcision only or upon
[1:29:25] the uncircumcision also
[1:29:28] for we say that Faith was reckoned to
[1:29:32] Abraham for righteousness praise the
[1:29:35] Lord
[1:29:37] that's the face seed now today that we
[1:29:40] are to him yes Amen to facing that's
[1:29:44] reckoned to us for righteousness
[1:29:47] amen because we believe
[1:29:49] how was it then reckoned
[1:29:52] when he was in circumcision
[1:29:55] or in uncircumcision
[1:29:58] not in circumcision but in
[1:30:01] uncircumcision you say well how could
[1:30:03] that be
[1:30:04] because if he had not to begin with
[1:30:07] there would have never been a
[1:30:10] circumcision
[1:30:12] you understand
[1:30:14] if he had not believed it that way when
[1:30:16] he was yet in uncircumcision he would
[1:30:19] have never circumcised
[1:30:22] because the faith wouldn't have been
[1:30:23] there to believe that that Covenant
[1:30:26] between him and God was real right had
[1:30:29] to be fake that had to be believed
[1:30:31] before there could be action
[1:30:34] so it had to come in his own
[1:30:36] circumcision that's what brought about
[1:30:38] the circumcision
[1:30:40] see because it says about the faith of
[1:30:43] Abraham that reckoned Abraham to
[1:30:45] righteousness
[1:30:46] how was it reckoned circumcision or
[1:30:49] uncircumcision not in circumcision but
[1:30:51] but in other circumcision
[1:30:53] praise the Lord the uncircumcision
[1:30:56] brought about the circumcision
[1:30:59] praise the Lord what couldn't have done
[1:31:01] it if it hadn't been
[1:31:03] and he received the sign of circumcision
[1:31:06] now he's receiving the sign of
[1:31:09] circumcision because his faith unto
[1:31:11] righteousness was already there
[1:31:14] praise God
[1:31:16] knows who is his Saints
[1:31:18] and because the Seal of that
[1:31:21] righteousness was already there
[1:31:24] God gave him this promise
[1:31:27] and all that did was bring about the
[1:31:29] actual action
[1:31:33] that caused him to circumcise
[1:31:37] the received 11th verse now he received
[1:31:41] the sign of circumcision a seal of the
[1:31:44] righteousness of the faith which he had
[1:31:47] yet been uncircumcised again he had that
[1:31:51] Faith unto righteousness while he was
[1:31:55] still uncircumcised
[1:31:57] praise the Lord why do you think the
[1:32:00] Holy Spirit God gave you the Holy Spirit
[1:32:01] to begin with right
[1:32:03] because you have the faith of that truth
[1:32:07] believing it and living it and obedience
[1:32:10] before God ever gave it to you if you
[1:32:12] were not in that position he would not
[1:32:15] have given it to you to start with
[1:32:19] so your faith began to build when you
[1:32:22] were living in the world if you ever
[1:32:25] were
[1:32:26] that Faith started that process began
[1:32:30] even when you weren't serving God
[1:32:34] so that when it got to that point and
[1:32:37] that faith that promise the two became
[1:32:40] one and God filled you with his spirit
[1:32:44] praise the Lord
[1:32:45] that made you and him one
[1:32:48] that made Abraham and him and God and
[1:32:51] their Covenant won
[1:32:53] and those that were after them
[1:32:55] God only gave it to him because he uh he
[1:32:58] was already
[1:33:00] the son of righteousness by faith he had
[1:33:04] that long before the uncircumcised
[1:33:06] before the circumcision ever came
[1:33:09] you have that before God ever filled you
[1:33:12] with his spirit and you became born
[1:33:14] again you already had that Faith to
[1:33:16] righteousness
[1:33:18] after you receive D the sale then the
[1:33:21] real righteousness of God come into your
[1:33:24] life
[1:33:25] because then that made the two of you
[1:33:27] won
[1:33:28] you and him become one
[1:33:31] he's the Lord amen oh it's a beautiful
[1:33:33] thing friend
[1:33:34] this this seal so important this
[1:33:37] circumcision we talk about the Holy
[1:33:39] Spirit here for him but it was just as
[1:33:40] important to Abraham to Abraham's seed
[1:33:43] to Abraham's Faith seed was just
[1:33:46] important that Royal Seed of Abraham
[1:33:50] Jesus Christ
[1:33:51] Grace amen I love it's beautiful of the
[1:33:56] faith let's go back to 11th verse now
[1:33:57] which he had been yet being
[1:33:59] uncircumcised that he might be the
[1:34:01] father of all them that believe though
[1:34:03] they were uh though they be not
[1:34:06] circumcised that righteousness might be
[1:34:09] imputed unto them also the righteousness
[1:34:12] of God might be imputed to them also
[1:34:16] praise the Lord to those who to those
[1:34:19] that believe
[1:34:21] it was the token that was given to them
[1:34:24] that's why brother Brown labeled when he
[1:34:27] spoke on this the four or five times he
[1:34:29] preached it the token
[1:34:31] the token the thing that's the pay the
[1:34:34] fairs the fair the pays the price has
[1:34:36] been paid
[1:34:38] amen I
[1:34:40] when I filed my job I don't I don't I
[1:34:43] don't go down there walk up to the gate
[1:34:45] and just get on the airplane
[1:34:47] the the security would be on me faster
[1:34:50] than the sun came up this morning
[1:34:53] they would they would hit me so hard and
[1:34:55] stop and say where's your ticket
[1:34:57] where has your price been paid and am I
[1:35:00] reaching my wallet and say you know I
[1:35:02] got I got credit cards here that's got

[1:35:14] go back and get your ticket right you

[1:35:18] you're a multi-billionaire I don't care
[1:35:21] if you're Warren Buffett Bill Gates uh
[1:35:24] Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos
[1:35:27] you got to go back to where they sell it
[1:35:30] amen yeah you have to go back to where
[1:35:32] they sell it reminds me of a story that
[1:35:35] um I've told I I'm sure I've told it
[1:35:37] here before but when I was lit when I
[1:35:39] was back in Charlotte and in business
[1:35:42] purchase manager
[1:35:44] we go on these uh trips that were uh for
[1:35:48] uh the beauty Barber Supply Institute
[1:35:51] conventions and buyer conventions and
[1:35:54] and they would always have functions and
[1:35:56] they would have dinners and they would
[1:35:57] have breakfast and they always just
[1:35:59] something to have the Pomp and
[1:36:00] Circumstances didn't mean anything
[1:36:02] didn't accomplish nothing it's just a
[1:36:04] way for a bunch of Rich companies to
[1:36:07] spend a bunch of money and live high on
[1:36:09] all but anyway one of the keynote
[1:36:12] speakers of I forgot breakfast dinner I
[1:36:15] can't remember one of them was Colin
[1:36:17] Powell
[1:36:18] which was an honor to meet the man
[1:36:20] um uh anyway I won't get into anything
[1:36:24] else but it was honor to meet you man he
[1:36:26] came up he was the keynote speaker very
[1:36:29] brilliant Oh my he was he he could have
[1:36:31] been an incredible president actually
[1:36:33] but
[1:36:34] um uh brilliant man but he gave the
[1:36:37] keynote speak and he told a story at the
[1:36:40] end that everybody found comical but I
[1:36:43] found very enlightening he talked about
[1:36:46] one time where he was at an event like
[1:36:49] that he was sitting at dinner some of
[1:36:51] you may have heard the story from me
[1:36:52] forgive me if you have to hear it again
[1:36:53] he was sitting at dinner
[1:36:56] in the same type Forum with a group of
[1:36:59] people and it was filled the room was
[1:37:01] filled and you know when you've got 200
[1:37:03] people in a room and a bunch of round
[1:37:04] tables you got waiters and waitresses
[1:37:06] going all over the place they're giving
[1:37:08] out drinks and they're giving out food
[1:37:09] and they're doing all this just as fast
[1:37:11] as they can do it going around
[1:37:12] everything and everybody and all talking
[1:37:14] and hanging out around and you know
[1:37:16] they're they're busy doing all this and
[1:37:18] the already that they could keep any
[1:37:20] organization there is when you came in
[1:37:22] you have to have you had to have a
[1:37:24] ticket to be able to get the meal uh you
[1:37:27] couldn't just come in as uh as an
[1:37:30] occupant of the hotel and just sit down
[1:37:33] at a chair and expect to get a steak
[1:37:35] dinner didn't work that way you had to
[1:37:37] have a ticket if you belong to that
[1:37:39] group or to that uh uh facility place
[1:37:43] that that it that was holding it they
[1:37:46] gave you something to show I belong to
[1:37:48] so-and-so company okay
[1:37:50] so they came around and they they passed
[1:37:53] out the food and uh she kept the the
[1:37:56] waitress kept skipping Colin Powell and
[1:38:00] went around and I I can't remember the
[1:38:03] whole story but soup and salad and
[1:38:05] whatever else and it came to main course
[1:38:06] and he kept looking around saying
[1:38:08] where's my food what's going on here and
[1:38:10] the man next to him finally spoke up
[1:38:13] and he said excuse me a minute ma'am he
[1:38:16] said this man has been set here this
[1:38:19] whole time and you haven't given him a
[1:38:21] single bite of food
[1:38:23] you haven't served him anything and he
[1:38:26] said do you not know who this man is
[1:38:29] this man is Colin Powell he's our
[1:38:33] speaker for today he's the he's I
[1:38:36] believe at the time he was the uh uh the
[1:38:39] uh uh the chairman of the joint Chief of
[1:38:43] Staff he answered directly to the
[1:38:46] president United States
[1:38:48] this man answers directly to the
[1:38:51] president of the United States is the
[1:38:53] chairman of the joint Chief of Staff
[1:38:54] this is Colin Powell she looked at that
[1:38:57] man and said I don't care who he is he
[1:38:58] didn't have a ticket
[1:39:01] amen
[1:39:03] she said she literally her job was to
[1:39:06] make sure whoever she served had to have
[1:39:08] a ticket she said I don't care who he is
[1:39:10] he didn't have a ticket
[1:39:12] and everybody laughed but I looked at it
[1:39:15] I thought my isn't that the truth
[1:39:18] people who can yell and scream and they
[1:39:20] can do all they want and say they're
[1:39:21] Christians and shout and scream and cry
[1:39:24] and raise their hands and however speak
[1:39:26] in tongues they want to but friend
[1:39:28] without that token you're not going
[1:39:30] anywhere am I amen Colin Powell wasn't
[1:39:33] gonna get one single bite of food
[1:39:34] because you didn't have a ticket didn't
[1:39:36] matter who he was you can go to that
[1:39:38] gate and you could have 80 billion
[1:39:40] dollars but you can't buy a ticket at
[1:39:42] the gate you've got to go back where
[1:39:44] they sell them
[1:39:45] isn't that what Jesus told them the the
[1:39:48] foolish virgins when they found out that
[1:39:50] they didn't have oil in their vessels
[1:39:52] and they came in onto those that were
[1:39:55] burning and they said hey give us of
[1:39:56] yours ours has run out they said we
[1:39:58] can't do that you got to go where they
[1:40:00] sell it yeah
[1:40:02] amen that's the only way you can
[1:40:05] to be able to possess the token you have
[1:40:07] to get it from the token seller the only
[1:40:10] way to get a plane ticket is to go to
[1:40:12] the place that sells the ticket
[1:40:15] you can't do it get on and say hey pilot
[1:40:17] here uh here's my money no it doesn't
[1:40:20] work that way neither does it work that
[1:40:22] way with God
[1:40:23] amen without the token without the
[1:40:25] ticket you're not going to go
[1:40:27] and that's the bottom line amen look one
[1:40:31] more
[1:40:32] of course the world
[1:40:35] let's go to Joshua for a moment
[1:40:40] the world's stolen God's token
[1:40:43] but that doesn't make it God's token any
[1:40:45] less
[1:40:47] amen even if the world has taken the
[1:40:50] that rainbow token that God gave to us
[1:40:53] of his promise even if the world's tried
[1:40:56] to steal it doesn't matter it still
[1:40:57] belongs to us still belongs to God it's
[1:40:59] still his token amen regardless of
[1:41:02] whoever wants to hijack it it still
[1:41:03] belongs to God it's still God's rainbow
[1:41:06] yes amen praise the Lord it is a read
[1:41:11] just thinking of that a racing is a
[1:41:14] token
[1:41:15] amen a seal if you will a token it shows
[1:41:19] that I belong to somebody in marriage
[1:41:21] right and she's sitting right over there
[1:41:24] she's got one just like it it shows that
[1:41:26] she belongs to me
[1:41:27] we're together in marriage it's a union
[1:41:30] that's a bond
[1:41:32] that will last through eternity as far
[1:41:34] as I'm concerned right amen may not be a
[1:41:37] marriage like we know it today but
[1:41:39] through eternity
[1:41:41] She's mine I'm hers that's that's the
[1:41:44] way it is for me and I'm glad it's that
[1:41:46] way but it's a token
[1:41:48] amen it's a signification it's a Signet
[1:41:51] that shows yeah I used to do the signets
[1:41:54] back in the 18th century
[1:41:57] people especially of renown would write
[1:41:59] a letter and scroll it up and put some
[1:42:01] wax on it and put a seal on it a bee or
[1:42:04] something bin it this is this came from
[1:42:06] this uh family and it's it's a the
[1:42:10] utmost importance it gets to where it's
[1:42:12] going yes and that Ryder puts his pouch
[1:42:14] and takes it to it amen and that
[1:42:17] recipient gets it and says oh my this is
[1:42:19] from the Bennetts I better open this
[1:42:22] because it signified something amen
[1:42:24] that's just a seal now one more let's
[1:42:27] we'll uh quit after this we'll close
[1:42:30] in Joshua chapter 2
[1:42:33] I want to read verse 21.
[1:42:37] 2 21.
[1:42:41] now we have Rahab
[1:42:44] I was reading this again
[1:42:46] and you know
[1:42:49] we get some stigmas and and be careful
[1:42:52] about what I'm saying because I don't
[1:42:53] mean this in the wrong way but we get
[1:42:55] certain certain stigmas about things
[1:42:58] that only God can only do something a
[1:43:01] certain way God can only do
[1:43:04] operate by his word
[1:43:06] amen but I want you to know when Joshua
[1:43:09] and and the Army went to go take over
[1:43:13] Jericho
[1:43:15] um which was walled by walls that were
[1:43:19] so thick brother random said three
[1:43:20] chariots could run a race on top side by
[1:43:23] side if the walls were so big
[1:43:25] and
[1:43:27] houses were on the wall
[1:43:30] and they sent a couple of spies in to
[1:43:34] spy out Jericho
[1:43:36] and they came into a Harless house I'm
[1:43:38] thinking why in the world
[1:43:40] with these two Godly men
[1:43:43] find residents in a Harlan's house
[1:43:47] and then I thought or the lord gave it
[1:43:49] to me what better place to hide
[1:43:53] if two strange men came into a city and
[1:43:57] they went and as normal would be people
[1:44:00] look at them and say Hey you know these
[1:44:01] guys they don't belong here they're not
[1:44:04] part of this city they're not my family
[1:44:06] they're your family you know so I'm
[1:44:07] Batman but two strange men going into a
[1:44:10] Harvard's house nobody think anything
[1:44:11] about it
[1:44:13] amen you could go Incognito because they
[1:44:17] wouldn't think anything about strange
[1:44:18] men going into an Harlan's house
[1:44:20] amen and it's exactly what they did
[1:44:24] these spies went into a Harlan's house
[1:44:26] Rahab the Harlot went into her house
[1:44:29] and as they spied out the land they
[1:44:32] found out the two men were there anyway
[1:44:34] but Rahab hid them
[1:44:36] and said from the guys that was trying
[1:44:38] to get to them and she said now we know
[1:44:40] that your God is God he's God of heaven
[1:44:43] and he's god of Earth what will you do
[1:44:45] for me in my house now that I've showed
[1:44:48] you this kindness and hid you and kept
[1:44:50] you from them getting to you or killing
[1:44:52] you or capturing you and let's read uh
[1:44:56] verse 12 let's start here now therefore
[1:44:59] I pray you swear unto me by the Lord
[1:45:01] since I have showed you kindness that he
[1:45:04] will also show kindness unto my father's
[1:45:06] house and give me a true token a sign a
[1:45:10] seal a Signet
[1:45:12] and that you will save a life my father
[1:45:14] and my mother and my brother and my
[1:45:16] sisters and all that they have and
[1:45:20] and deliver our lives from death and you
[1:45:22] don't you want to worry about your
[1:45:24] family
[1:45:25] amen put them under the token amen Rahab
[1:45:30] the Harlot
[1:45:32] because of her kindness to Joshua's Army
[1:45:36] was under that token yes
[1:45:39] and she didn't just want to be under the
[1:45:41] token she brought her whole family under
[1:45:43] that boat yeah yeah so no no damage
[1:45:47] nothing harmful was going to come to any
[1:45:50] of her family
[1:45:51] praise the Lord oh friend I always loved
[1:45:55] God's promises amen amen
[1:46:01] they have my sisters and all that they
[1:46:04] have and deliver our lives from death
[1:46:06] and the men answer her our life for
[1:46:08] yours if he utter not this our business
[1:46:11] and it shall be when the Lord hath given
[1:46:14] us the land that we will deal kindly and
[1:46:17] truly with thee
[1:46:20] then she let them down by a court
[1:46:22] through the window
[1:46:24] for her house was upon the town wall and
[1:46:27] she dwelt upon the wall
[1:46:29] and she said unto them get you to the
[1:46:31] mountain unless the pursuers meet you
[1:46:33] and hide yourselves there three days
[1:46:34] until the pursuers be returned in a way
[1:46:37] and afterward may go your way go uh ye
[1:46:40] go your way and the men said unto her
[1:46:44] we will be blameless of this thine oath
[1:46:47] which thou has made us to swear behold
[1:46:50] when we come into the land Thou shalt uh
[1:46:53] bind this line of scarlet thread in the
[1:46:56] window which thou Hast uh did US let
[1:47:00] down uh let us down by and thou shalt
[1:47:03] bring thy father thy mother thy brother
[1:47:05] and all thy Father's House home unto
[1:47:08] thee and it shall be the whosoever shall
[1:47:10] go out of the doors of thy house into
[1:47:12] the street his blood shall be upon his
[1:47:15] head and we will be Guiltless and
[1:47:17] whosoever shall be uh with thee in the
[1:47:20] house his blood shall be on our head if
[1:47:24] any hand be upon Him notices very
[1:47:26] similar to what they did with the
[1:47:29] Paschal Lamb
[1:47:30] amen you had to be under the token
[1:47:34] had to be in the home where the blood
[1:47:37] was shed
[1:47:39] amen you had to be in the home
[1:47:43] for the promise to be effective
[1:47:46] you had to be in the household couldn't
[1:47:48] be outside you had to be in the house
[1:47:51] and if thou utter this our business then
[1:47:54] we will quit of art of thine oath which
[1:47:56] thou has made us to swear and she said
[1:47:58] according unto your word so be it and
[1:48:01] she sent them away and they departed and
[1:48:03] she bound the Scarlet line in the window
[1:48:06] the Scarlet line in the winter and they
[1:48:08] went and came unto the mountain and both
[1:48:10] there three days until the sewers
[1:48:12] returned and the pursuers sought them
[1:48:14] throughout all the way but found them
[1:48:16] not so the two men returned and
[1:48:18] descended from the mountain and passed
[1:48:20] over uh came to Josh with the son of
[1:48:22] none and told all things that befell
[1:48:24] them so on and so forth and the token
[1:48:28] the stream the cord that was let down
[1:48:31] was the thing that signified it was the
[1:48:35] seal the token that let them know that
[1:48:40] this is the woman's house of whom is
[1:48:43] safe from any route of the children of
[1:48:46] Israel right her and that house there on
[1:48:49] that on that wall amen now Al
[1:48:53] how
[1:48:55] unless I've missed something in the
[1:48:56] scripture how that house
[1:48:59] survived the falling of the wall I'll I
[1:49:02] don't know
[1:49:03] amen now we know the wall fell flat to
[1:49:08] the ground had to because they marched
[1:49:11] right into the City and took over
[1:49:13] the wall didn't crumble down where they
[1:49:15] had to crawl over a bunch of Boulders
[1:49:17] and stuff just to try to get into the
[1:49:19] city but while the Bible says the Wall
[1:49:21] fall flat
[1:49:23] and they walk right in at her house is
[1:49:26] on the town wall
[1:49:28] but God kept them yes God saved him and
[1:49:32] Joshua and his army did nothing hurtful
[1:49:36] to her and her family because they were
[1:49:37] under the token she brought them by the
[1:49:40] promise under the token yes that was
[1:49:44] signified by a stream
[1:49:47] so notice it could be
[1:49:49] literally anything that signifies a
[1:49:52] promise a wedding ring back in the Old
[1:49:55] Testament was a was a crown like that a
[1:49:57] woman wore that had tokens in them
[1:50:00] remember the woman who had lost one of
[1:50:01] them which would signify she had been
[1:50:03] unfaithful she searched that house up
[1:50:06] one side down the other she counted the
[1:50:09] ants the dust bunnies and everything
[1:50:11] that was in that home because she had to
[1:50:14] find that token before her husband came
[1:50:16] home
[1:50:17] amen or he would have got rid of her
[1:50:20] it's a lot of things signified a token
[1:50:23] Signet a seal
[1:50:25] the Seal of the Holy Spirit but you know
[1:50:27] how it binds itself together that's how
[1:50:30] perfect the word is
[1:50:32] people will say that there's the word is
[1:50:34] fallible the word is contradictions the
[1:50:37] word is the Bible does so-and-so friend
[1:50:40] every bit of it if you have a revelation
[1:50:42] of what God's word is and what it speaks
[1:50:45] to you there's not one single
[1:50:47] contradiction in here amen not one
[1:50:50] single thing in here contradicts the
[1:50:51] other it might contradict your opinion
[1:50:54] it might contradict your education it
[1:50:58] might contradict your science but it
[1:51:00] does not contradict itself right amen it
[1:51:04] is perfect in continuity together
[1:51:06] beautiful the way God brings it all
[1:51:09] together to help us realize what it
[1:51:12] really means to us to be sealed of the
[1:51:14] Holy Spirit
[1:51:15] amen amen the token
[1:51:19] also
[1:51:21] as we close
[1:51:23] separates the True Believer from the
[1:51:26] unbeliever and make-believer yes
[1:51:28] amen it separates
[1:51:31] it brings a division
[1:51:34] it brings a point of of
[1:51:37] a Chasm between the two
[1:51:40] amen
[1:51:41] belief and unbelief
[1:51:44] being yoked together
[1:51:47] has to be something of faith of this
[1:51:50] token that brings the two together
[1:51:52] it brings the separation it shows
[1:51:55] because you're not like them
[1:51:57] you're different you're bought with the
[1:51:59] price you belong to God amen amen praise
[1:52:02] the Lord let's stand if we could
[1:52:15] praise the Lord the Seal of the Holy
[1:52:18] Spirit
[1:52:20] without it friend
[1:52:22] it means nothing
[1:52:25] all that we go through everything that
[1:52:27] happens in this life what is it if it
[1:52:30] wasn't
[1:52:32] God sealing us
[1:52:34] showing we belong to him

[1:57:32] next Sunday now I'm I'm driving back to
[1:57:35] El Paso again so I'm driving so it has
[1:57:38] no effect on the service but now August
[1:57:41] 6th I'll say it again before it gets
[1:57:44] here but August 6th I'll need to move it
[1:57:47] up again the service if it's okay uh uh
[1:57:50] half hour
[1:57:51] 30 minutes if that works okay so let's
[1:57:54] go back to Pennsylvania
[1:57:55] uh for the month of August so that week
[1:58:00] the flight leaves at like 1 20 so
[1:58:05] there's nothing it's amazing the way the
[1:58:08] airlines are getting it's amazing how
[1:58:11] much they're changing stuff and for some
[1:58:15] reason afternoon flights two three
[1:58:17] o'clock flights out of Tucson are just
[1:58:19] they're just going away
[1:58:21] they're getting less let's just put it
[1:58:23] that way so we'll just see whatever the
[1:58:27] Lord has planned it'll get better when
[1:58:30] the time changes back they just leave it
[1:58:32] alone uh just put it like it's supposed
[1:58:35] to be if we were on mountain time it
[1:58:37] would be okay
[1:58:38] but anyway so next on next couple of
[1:58:42] Sundays everything's fine but just in
[1:58:45] the back your mind August 6th I'll
[1:58:48] announce again we'll probably be pushed
[1:58:50] up a half hour or so
[1:58:52] um
[1:58:53] so remember that in prayer I appreciate
[1:58:55] that and again continue to remind you
[1:58:58] about that the 20th is sketchy so we'll
[1:59:01] see about that uh what happens on August
[1:59:04] 20th it got us scheduled out
[1:59:06] further than we normally are now so uh
[1:59:09] it's kind of different but
[1:59:12] um I uh I'll be glad this coming week to
[1:59:15] get some rest hopefully

[1:59:21] means a lot to me it really does and I
[1:59:24] know I'm on the road and I know I'm
[1:59:26] digging deep for that last minute of
[1:59:29] energy and I know you're praying it
