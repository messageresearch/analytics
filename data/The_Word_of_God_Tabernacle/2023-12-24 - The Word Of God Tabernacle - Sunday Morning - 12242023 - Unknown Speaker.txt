let's stand to our feet if we could now we'll go ahead and change over the service amen just have a little Christmas thought this morning amen that came on my heart the other day trust it just be a blessing to you amen we're going to turn our Bibles to Matthew chapter 1 Matthew chapter 1 begin our scripture reading there Matthew chapter 1 of course read about the account one of the scriptural accounts of the birth of Jesus Christ amen Matthew chap 1 thank you Jesus Matthew Chapter 1 Verse 18 amen before we read this just bow our heads for another word of prayer if we could Lord Jesus father we're so very thankful again this place this time thank you Lord for blessing and strength us to come to your house today thank you Lord for this word for that message thank you Lord for coming in flesh coming in the in the womb of a woman Lord to be birth forth into this world and to become a flesh man to live your life to Die the most cruel death to go to hell and to take the keys of death and hell to raise again Lord Victorious and to come back again upon us the worshipper today that your Holy Spirit could be birthed in us that your word would be birth forth in us and that we lord as representatives of yours as your as we could maybe say incubators today Lord because you live in us today you not just live in us like you did Mary but you live through US father you're holy spirit that the life that's in there God that that Spirit exudes from every part of who we are father because we yield to that Spirit we relinquish our members over to that Spirit Lord in every way we thank you Lord Jesus Lord this world is celebrating a commercialized what they call Christmas the world believes this is the birth of Jesus we know better Lord but we still celebrate father the fact in knowing that you were born Lord your life came into this world and we so thank you for it Lord because you didn't have to do it God you didn't have to send your only son to come and die and to Die the most cruel death and to live and to shed his blood but you did it and you did it just for us and we thank you Lord today God for this time thank you for the fellowship thank you for your word thank you for the spirit Lord we F in this place even now God knowing that the author is you accomplish now Lord that purpose that you have this service for today we'll commit it all into your hands and ask your blessings upon the remaining part of it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen Matthew chapter 1 I want to begin with Verse 18 Matthew 1:18 now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth the son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins Jesus Jehovah Savior and now all all this was done that it might be fulfilled which is spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name Jesus amen you could be seated if you'd like amen they called his name Jesus what a precious name Saints no name given under heaven where men could be saved with the name of Jesus now I want to take just a small subject today uh the thought that came to me the other day was uh well I had a different I had a different title till yesterday but uh just want to title this Jesus birth in me amen Jesus birth in me and we talk about the birth of Jesus Christ in the scripture here the birth of Jesus Christ being on this wise and we know the birth of Jesus Christ was because that God put a seed in Mary that was conceived by the Holy Ghost amen and understanding this is what brings this into a greater perspective for us because you know that the comforter that we know of as being the comforter which is what comes and lives in us the Holy Ghost had not been instituted to the people uh to be filled with the Holy Ghost at this time it did not come until after Jesus birth and burial and resurrection and his coming and sending that comforter he said the Holy Spirit down upon us to not only be with us but live in US amen Jesus birth in us and but but here we know that as God existed as God existed the Holy Spirit existed because God is one they want to chop him up into three pieces into three Gods but I want you to understand this is still just the one living God it's not three it's one God and to understand that if you take in perspective that the Holy Ghost only came to be after Jesus death then that that would uh that would take the scripture out of context the Holy Ghost was in existence because God was in existence it's just a manifestation of God that's all the Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ was simply a manifestation of God the Holy Ghost is just a manifestation of God all the attributes of who God is do we just major these three of course the scripture but all of who God is was a part of God before the foundation of the world and is still God today none of it's changed none of it's gone away it's all God in the beginning was God the logos Amen in the beginning was him and it is God and the Holy Ghost then came now if I I if we say and We Know by scripture that God is the father of Jesus Christ that's what that's what the scripture says amen the people didn't try to chop them up into three pieces but if you chop him into three pieces then who becomes Jesus father at that point everybody wants to say God is his father but what about the Holy Ghost because the Bible here says that that je that M Mary was uh conceived in her womb a seed by the Holy Ghost so now is he by the holy ghost or is he by God because if they're two different gods then you make Jesus illegitimate God he can't only be one because they're one and the same amen just different applications just different ways of expressing himself just like I don't express myself as husband to my wife the same way I express myself to my son as father I don't express myself to him the same way I express myself to her I don't express myself to you the same way I do it to my son or to my daughter or to my to my wife I don't I don't uh Our Lives aren't expressed to one another in the same venue to each person it depends on the the application the time that we are that we are living the place that we need to accomplish what do we need to do what does God need to do uh in a certain instance so he sends the Holy Spirit uh with the seed to plant in Mary so that Mary would conceive of the seed so that Jesus Christ would be would be formed in her womb and come forth this human flesh it's just a different application same God Amen same God God's not a different God God hasn't changed he's the same God he's the same God now as he has always been amen now let's go over to St John chapter 18 St John chapter 18 I just want to read one verse of scripture here St John chapter 18 and just read this one verse of scripture verse 37 now Jesus comes before Pilate of course in this situation with pilate and pilate of course is speaking to him uh talking back and forth and and uh pilate sees it there there's not what uh uh these people are crying about about Jesus they're making all sorts of false accusations against Jesus but they don't want to acknowledge it amen but but P but uh but pilate knows pilate just standing here just for the few minutes he was standing there recognized their accusations against him were false they recognized and knew that those accusations weren't true just by standing there talking to the man just by standing there and being in his presence they recognized and knew that uh that that their accusations were false so Jesus so pilate comes and uh gives him one of these accusations he said pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a king amen but that's what all the others were claiming that he was say Amen you go look and say Jesus never said that that was other people's acclamation that they said about him he was claiming to be something he wasn't amen thou art a king thou sayest that I am a king but look now he says to this end look it wasn't to be king but there was a purpose there that God had amen there was a purpose recognized here that God had for sending Jesus Christ on this Earth Jesus recognizing that purpose Jesus acknowledging that purpose and Jesus giving that purpose to pilate to understand for this cause or to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth amen praise the Lord that's the first thing that Jesus Christ was here to Bear witness to the truth to Bear witness of the truth and doesn't say and but there's a period there everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice so now what does that mean that means that those who are not of the truth cannot hear his voice but those who are of the truth because Jesus came to bear witness of the truth those that are of the truth bear witness of who he is amen because those are the ones that recognize now this is not Jew this is not Gentile this is not uh Heathen this is not this is whoever believes whoever believes the truth whoever is of the truth hears The Voice of Truth praise the Lord that voice speaks and as that voice speaks that Spirit begins to multiply itself in your life amen or grow if you will amen the scripture says multiply when it says multiply it just means it's growing it doesn't mean there's two or three or six or eight or 10 12 of them it just means it's growing it's multiplying it's growing and as it grows in each one of us there had to been a a a a birth to come forth to bring us to the place that we are new creatures that brings us to the place to receive of the truth and of the truth the new birth of the truth is to bring a new birth into our lives it's wonderful that Jesus was born naturally uh we thank God we celebrate this the time of year that we celebrate that even though we we know he wasn't born uh December 25th we celebrate that birth praise the Lord uh and as long as we celebrate it we celebrate Jesus Christ not all the things that go with Christmas and everything else and what it has become but we celebrate Jesus amen that's the whole point of it to celebrate Jesus amen and when we celebrate Jesus we are thankful that God send him in a natural human flesh and a natural birth in human flesh we thank God he did that but the reason he did that was it was it so he could go away and come back and be birthed in you the more important thing the the greater aspect here is it Jesus's natural birth we thank God for that it's the spiritual birth that he's birthed forth in each one of our Lives that's the most important thing amen the most important thing to us every single aspect of what God did and every single way that Jesus lived it was for you it was for me it was for us it was for his people it was to Bear witness of the truth amen and all those that are of the truth will hear it praise God we hear that because it speaks to us we thank God for the natural birth friend but what about the spiritual birth in each one of us that life that's birthed forth in in Us Praise the Lord where would we be without that people celebrate his natural birth that have no clue about what a spiritual birth is that have never experienced it that don't know anything about it there's a lot of people that are celebrating Christmas Eve tomorrow Christmas because because uh because it's it's an event that people celebrate it's it's something of a holiday and and and a giving and a time of being together with family friends and uh of giving and and it become so commercialized though the and the the reciprocity and uh I I saw a thing the other day uh a guy went through uh this he said he'd never do Secret s at work again CU he went through all this thing and he he did all this he went through and got a thoughtful gift and wrapped it and all this and his the Splendor and everything it went with it and he was so proud of his gift to give and he got a box of leftover chocolates from Halloween oh my that was just barely had a bow on it and he was mad I like why would you be so upset because what he got wasn't at least close to equivalent to what he gave but that's not at all what Christmas is about Christmas is about giving Jesus gave Everything Jesus gave none of it was taking it was all to give and what he gave far surpassed anything that we could ever hope to try to give to him praise the Lord I I don't think he's quite that mad amen because it's not about reciprocity it's about giving it's about in your heart having a free will this even actually goes back to our Thanksgiving message of of Free Will giving it's something in your heart that you want to do right you want to give but you do that but see how much it means to those that have had Jesus born in them when Jesus is born in you it changes everything change your life everything about life and perspectives and none of those things don't matter anymore amen I remember when I was a boy uh when I was a little kid uh Emma and Joel's age uh I I my grandmother gave me socks every year and I couldn't stand it I I think I may have asked my dad one time I says does gran not know how to give anything other than orange sockes or or or yellow socks I I I every year uh socks that I never wore uh that I didn't like every year but that was just the selfish thought of of of a little boy you know who who wanted a toy or something I didn't want an old nasty pair of socks I wanted a toy or something but every year uh my my dad's mom gave me a pair of socks every year and I uh but now you understand more you get older and grow up it's not about what you get it's what you can give amen I I am much more happier about what I can give than anything that I could get in fact honestly uh in my family sitting here I don't I don't care if I ever got one gift wouldn't matter to me I I I don't care it's it's not a significant I appreciate them and I thank God for them but the greatest gift that we could ever get was Jesus Christ and he did everything and and gave everything amen that we could have life uh a couple of scriptures like I said I won't be long today St John chapter 16 amen we're thankful that one of our prayers worked very quickly we had prayer for sister Norma during prayer and she show and she comes through the door that's pretty quick Lord answers prayer fast sometimes doesn't he amen so good to see sister Norman St John 16:7 one verse of scripture here Jesus said nevertheless I tell you the truth the truth see going back to the truth what is the truth that was pilate's question we didn't read that but the next verse down below was uh pilate said what is truth amen truth is standing right there truth is not something you tell amen truth is a person truth is Jesus Christ and Jesus is telling them nevertheless I tell you the truth now those who receive the truth believe the truth amen those are the ones that Jesus came to speak to those are the ones he came for I tell you the truth it is expedient for you in in other words it's important for you it means a lot to you that I go away for if I if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I will send him unto you praise the Lord the comforter that's why it was exped OB that Jesus I understand how they felt I I can only imagine they didn't want Jesus to go anywhere he had just told them up here I don't have much time left here and they're like no don't leave us we don't want you to leave us I wouldn't want him to leave me either amen but then after they got a revelation of what took place and then Pentecost actually revealed itself and took place and manifested there on the day of Pentecost they begin to understand a lot greater about what it meant when Jesus told him this that's why Jesus told people when you are converted then you can strengthen the brothers when you receive this Revelation when you can see what's going on when you know what is happening see God doesn't always show everything to us right away a lot of people some people in the message believe that uh brother brandham knew everything about everything about God and and and and all brother Brandon brother brandham only knew what God showed him because he was a man and only what brother brandom needed to know is what God showed him what God made him privy to God didn't show everything to brother brandham there's I I I I can't say I have a quote for this but I would imagine most of brother bram's life was lived just like ours he walked by faith amen you've heard the takes you've seen the video brother brandom even stood there himself and said I am helpless unless he comes right I am waiting on him I can't do anything unless he comes and operates this gift I am useless right I'm paraphrasing a little bit Yeah it had to be God to come and do it what's the same thing today brother bandam and that gift may be gone but God is still here to manifest himself and to operate that in our lives so that we know that Jesus Christ is still the same yesterday today and forever he hasn't changed he's still God and he's still here sending the Holy Spirit comforter that a new birth took place in my life that Jesus was birthed in your life not in a Manger amen although I I find it curious I haven't gone out a lot I've tried to stay home this week and rest my knee as much as possible but uh I haven't gone out a lot this week but I find it curious told my wife last night we went to dinner and I said I I you hardly ever find an nativity scene anymore they're scripturally inacurate most of them especially with the wise men and the gifts we've already went through that for two or three Christmases we know that's not accurate but just the mere fact that they would have them amen of Jesus being there as a part of their display in front of in their front yard that that to me means something uh might not to a lot of people and uh they seem to be going away but it still it's the same thing if it hadn't been for that but that perpetrated or per uh uh uh was ahead of was a preview of what it was to be in the birth in US of his birth in US Jesus birth in us first John or excuse me St John still chapter one so the question that becomes to all of us what does Christmas mean to you what does Christmas mean to you amen means a lot of things to a lot of people means nothing to some people amen but especially in this country Christmas means a lot to a lot of people they consider it something of a holy day they consider it sacred amen it's important to them is the way it's become and all that happened with it is still important to a lot of people it means a lot um the White House and and uh New York City and big cities places like this they they they had these big Pomp and Circumstance that they have because they cut down these 30 40 foot pine trees to come and set them up and and decorate them and put ornaments on them and all this stuff to to to celebrate the if nothing else the Pomp and Circumstance it follows with with with Christmas nowadays the commercialization of Christmas but it means something there's something significant that's behind it that's the whole point that's that's why they do that there there's a reason why they do that but let's look now St John chapter one uh let's just begin reading with verse one in the beginning was the word the logos that life that came out of God see another aspect see they don't we don't include that understandably scripturally in the Trinity as they call it father son holy ghost first second third third position uh but this is just as much a part that God played of the attribute of God as the others amen when that logos came out of God it played just as much just as important a role as the holy spirit it's a different role but it's just important as a role so to try to confine God into this little space it just is just arrogance and and excuse me but ignorance amen God is not three God is one and he has all these attributes this logos that's one of those attributes in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and that's Zoe the literal life of God in him was life and the life was the light of men that life that Zoey the literal life of God was the light of men and that's why uh John 3 uh 18 I think says that men love Darkness rather than light right because they've rejected Jesus Christ and when they reject Jesus Christ you reject light well what you reject you don't like you don't want to have anything to do with it they they they'd rather be in darkness why cuz they're deed are evil and they don't want Jesus because Jesus would shed light on their evil deeds and make them and con and condemn them for their deeds and people and people don't like that amen if you're not born again the Zoey God the life of God was the light that life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that light that was the True Light listen now that was the True Light which lith every man that come cometh into the world every human not just males every human that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not the world knew him not didn't want him came to his own his own knew him not didn't want him but amen the world didn't want him his people didn't want him but as many as received him now this is the same group of people that Jesus was speaking to Pilot about those that he spoke of Truth and those who are of the truth would hear his word not the world not even his own people but as many US received him to them praise God who would what hear the truth believe the truth become the truth Jesus Christ in flesh birthed again in US praise God Hall to them oh thank God I can say I'm one of them amen praise the Lord to them gave he power or the authority to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name now that would lead you to believe that we were not originally a people we were not originally of the economy of God because he gave us the authority to become a Son of God praise the Lord The Authority by the Holy Spirit to be born again and to come into as a part of the economy of God by New Birth praise God hallelujah thank God for that birth he gave us the power to become the authority to become a Son of God even to them that believe on his name Hallelujah to believe on him which were born not of blood nor of the will of Flesh nor of the will of man but of God born of God praise the Lord Jesus thank you you say I was born of the Holy Ghost well the Bible says I was born of God now if you chop them into three pieces you got two different gods doing the same thing no it's just one God Amen it's just one God doing this act in your life bringing that Spirit into you his own Spirit the spirit of God what is the Holy Ghost what is the holy spirit it's the spirit of God you have a human Spirit if you had the ability you could take your spirit and put it into somebody else we don't have that ability we're not God he's God he takes his spirit and puts it in you now what is your human Spirit your human spirit is the life of the body so what would his Spirit be it would be the consummation of his life and what was his life be put in you hallelujah it's a new birth praise the lord it's God's spirit in you not another Spirit not a third person in the godhead but it's God's spirit in you the power that you have to become the authority by that Spirit to become a son or daughter of God hallelujah all praise the Lord we're born of God born of God new bird that thing that Nicodemus came to Jesus asking about amen maybe we'll just read it here minute but let me finish this 14th verse and the word the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory is that of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth became word the word the logos became flesh praise the Lord now that same attribute that one attribute of God that we read here that word that logos that that came out of God God that brewed over the Earth that logos that God that went into the the the Flesh of MDC one day then became Jesus Christ it's the same logos not a different God not it's the same logos it's the spirit of God it's the life of God it's the word of God that that came out of God and brewed over the Earth you could do the same if you were not human you could do the same thing with yours but you can't because you're not God but he is God we confine God down to our little human regulation Saints and it doesn't have anything to do with our human abilities or our human regulations or our human inabilities if you will God can do whatever he wants whenever he wants however he wants and there's nobody can tell him how to do it better or different he's God the word made flesh that word that logos was made flesh how in the body of Jesus Christ where where did that logos go where did that word go what is the word of seed where did that seed go it went into the womb of Mary and it birth forth the child that child grew in the womb of Mary and she birth forth the Flesh of word Jesus Christ amen that birth now comes in us not in the same way amen and I thank God it's not in the same way I I I don't particularly myself as a male although uh people in the world are saying a man can have a baby I'm sorry I I that's just ridiculous but uh I I don't have a womb for that to have taken place in so I thank God that in the womb of my heart as we sang that song I think sister Le Fontaine wrot Cherry in the womb of my heart amen Jesus was birth forth again birth forth AR fresh praise the Lord and now living in us that's what the real Christmas is about that's what the real holiday we celebrate here amen it's not Jesus in a manger it's it's not Jesus out somewhere or uh in in the church or in a in a person it's Jesus Christ in you amen it's Jesus the birth of Christ in each of us That's What Christmas Means to us Christ in me I celebrate it because he's my life he's who I am he's everything I am am everything I could be Nicodemus now John 3 we go over a couple of chapters St John chapter 3 there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus ruler of the Jews same came by uh the same came to Jesus by Night amen must have been sort of embarrassed to do what he was doing because he had to come by night said unto him Rabbi we we who he's by himself we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God you notice that's the very first thing that Jesus told Nicodemus I mean talk about unloading a full load in one shot he didn't pull any punches with Nicodemus he didn't conversate with him he didn't try to smooze him any or make him feel good he just let him have it a man must be born again that's the bottom line didn't explain it didn't try to help him understand it didn't preach it to him he just said a man must be born again Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter into the W uh the second time into his mother's womb and be born Jesus answered verily verily I say unto you except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter into the king kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit praise God hallah there it is in a nutshell those that celebrate Christmas is just a just a fleshly act to them I enjoy the holiday season I do I mean for the most part uh this time of year I one of the biggest reasons I like is because in Tucson the weather starts getting cooler but uh I like this time of year it's it's it's nice uh the atmosphere and things but it it's become so commercialized it's of the flesh everything about it is of the flesh but to us it's not that to us it's not of the flesh to us it's of the spirit Jesus told Nicodemus that which is of the flesh is flesh amen and they have theirs but but that which is of the spirit is spirit and we have ours amen and that is of the spirit What Spirit the spirit of Jesus Christ Marvel not that I said unto thee you must be born again the Wom bloweth where it l listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but cast not tell which it come uh which it cometh and whether it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit Nicodemus answered and said unto him how can these things be see thinking naturally that's all he was thinking was naturally but Jesus speaking unto him of spiritual things all he could understand was that of the natural Jesus those that are of the natural is natural those that's of the flesh flesh but that that is of the spirit is of the spirit and of that Spirit comes Life Light truth Revelation understanding that comes from God doesn't come from us doesn't come from man it comes from God that that's of the spirit because only God is of the spirit hallah and and Jesus hold him you must be born again there is no exception there is no other way there is no other God there there is no other entity this is the only way you want eternal life there's one way and that's this way you want to go to heaven there's only one way this is the way now different religions call it different thing paradise whatever you might want to call it uh but if you want to go there in that place of perfect peace the only way to get there is through Jesus Christ regardless of what any other religion or anybody else or any other God says amen it must go through Jesus Christ first John I got two more scriptures I want to read 1 John chapter 3 1 John 38 and9 he that committed sin is of the devil for the devil sinth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God for this purpose for this purpose the Son of God was manifested amen that's going back to Jesus speaking to pilate of the truth what is truth he's standing right in front of you pilate your eyes are so blinded you can't see it he's standing right in front of all the people and all the uh the the uh priests and uh High priests and and all the authority and all religious leaders of the Jews at that time they're all standing there they're all screaming and yelling to crucify truth to crucify the king to crucify the Messiah that's all they see all they see is a man they don't they can't see that he's Jesus Christ the son of man but he told him this this is the purpose amen for the devil sent it from the beginning for this purpose the son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil what's the works of the devil lies The Works of the devil is lies through whomever they come a lie is a lie and a li is of the devil because truth comes from Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ came to bear witness of the truth and which one destroys the other light destroys Darkness truth destroys lies Jesus overcome and greater than anything that the devil tries to bring against God's children anything and everything he came to bear witness of the truth and those that are of the truth will hear him for this reason to destroy the works of the devil the devil's lies the devil is unbelief amen the devil is unbelief to keep you from believing who Jesus Christ really is Jesus came to destroy that praise God so Jesus was manifested on this Earth to destroy the works of the devil how with truth amen with truth with light praise the Lord and whosoever is born of God there we go back to the same scripture again told you last week we've been this been on this scripture for whatever reason for weeks now back to it again this is the lord gave me whoever is born of God does not commit sin what is that lies unbelief a sin is not a single act or thought you did Sin is unbelief sin is not believing in the only begotten Son of God sin is not believing in God Almighty go sin is not believing in Jesus Christ sin is not an act it's not a specific deed or thought amen it is unbelief Jesus came to destroy unbelief because what is unbelief unbelief is a lie that's right praise God because he really he lives he exists God is real he's the same today amen Jesus came to destroy that his birth here on Earth was wonderful and it had to happen and praise God for it but oh what his birth in me means Jesus being birthed In Me whosoever Is borned of God does not unbelieve does not disbelieve praise the Lord he might make a mistake but he doesn't stop believing amen he might trip up but he doesn't stop believing he might be con uh uh uh uh trapped but he doesn't stop believing right praise the Lord amen you hear me for his sin his seed the seed of God remaineth in Me In You in him and he cannot disbelieve because he's born of God hallelujah he cannot disbelieve it no matter what comes no matter what the devil tries to do no matter what Satan throws at him no matter how much the devil tries to convince him of it he or or condemn him he cannot disbelieve because he's born of God praise the Lord thank God for the new birth amen thank God for the new birth helps me understand puts me in my position gets me to realize this is more than just me yeah it's more than just Mighty your secrecies it's more than just what I could think feel touch hear smell amen he means more to me than any of that Saints his life in me the birth in me praise the Lord I cannot disbelieve God I cannot go back to the way I was before well I say way I was before I I have never in my life ever ever I never in my let me say this again I never in my life ever that I can ever ever remember in the worst hum humanic State I was in never have I ever in my life not believed in God right yeah no matter where I was no matter what I was going through no how matter how old I that I can remember back as young as I as far as I back as I can remember I never in my life ever disbelieved God ever I didn't serve him a lot of times I didn't live for him I wasn't born again but I believed in him there was never a time I didn't believe in God Amen one more scripture I'll close here I say that for our benefit because hopefully it helps somebody you look back in life you say you know what that's true even as a child I still believe in God Amen I still belied in God still do one more St John 5:4 for what ever is for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith praise the Lord even our faith because we know we believe like I said never been a time I didn't believe amen never been a time where my faith wasn't in front the foremost part part of my life in faith believing and knowing that regardless if I've never seen him never heard him audibly in that capacity the Corporal body I still know he exists I still know he is I still know he's God and I still know he's the god over Heaven and Earth and he's my God yes and now praise God that God lives in me amen that that now he's my life he said not is not just a belief amen cuz understand Saints Satan believes in him too right Satan believes in God too but it's not just simply a belief
