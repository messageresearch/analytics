amen if you're home um I have never sang this song I don't sing this song very often because it's quite a difficult one to sing I tried to get out of singing this song but the Lord wouldn't let me and with Micah not here it makes it even uh a little more challenging because Micah knows the note that I sing I can basically I have such well I can't sing anyway but uh the my range is so limited that I have to start at a specific level uh to be able to hit the low and then the high parts uh so if I do mess up please forgive me try to start it over again but I want to sing this song it's everything that we could think is a song to glorify Jesus Christ amen uh this song to me embodies everything that Jesus is amen and U I've felt to sing it uh Christmas song people I don't know if people consider this a Christmas song or not but goes right along with the message too so we're going to we're going to sing it amen I'm sure we all know it uh so we're gonna we're going to do our very best to try to

bit but I think I ventured out pretty safely on that one amen knowing you the way I do so amen praise the Lord so amen I you have a testimony sister it's some people are not here this morning and it's

the song uh whoever it was they were inspired amen praise the Lord so let's stand to our feet if we could then we'll go right to the scripture Exodus chap 26 as I said this will be part six uh or part six part three uh the last part of uh going Beyond the Veil uh going Beyond the Veil we had had kind of did not plan it that way but it kind of turned out to where the last part of this was going to be really perfect for a Christmas message uh which is unusual I already kind of have a St my mind for the Christmas uh message uh that would have been last Sunday uh but it's going to be today so uh Lord willing uh this be a blessing to you today Exodus chapter 26 we're going to begin begin reading with verse 33 just read a couple of verses of scripture and uh draw our text on today and finish up this going Beyond the Veil if you remember the first two parts and uh going into those uh talking about that Veil and getting to this place this is the point this third part really is the part that was instrumental in the fall of uh of this little Series so uh trust and prayer be a blessing to you but for your be let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer if we could Lord Jesus father God we're so very thankful Lord Of Your Grace your mercy your blessings Lord thank you for being here today we know God that without you all of this would be in vain but Lord we we thank you Father that we are here God and we're able to turn back the pages of this holy RIT trusting you to speak to us from it once again today Lord we know that we can read the words on this on this bi in this Bible we know that we can speak on them Lord but it takes you to come and bring an anointing Lord it takes you to come and and reveal it to us Lord to show it to us to open it to us Lord that it be manifest as you manifest yourself to us God that we can see and hear what you'd have for us to know through this portion of your scripture today Lord let it be an encouragement let let it be a blessing let it be what every one of us God are Desiring needing and Lord have something as we walk out of this place today knowing that you spoke to us father God we are very grateful Lord if you bringing us through another year Lord we've had uh several UPS we've had many Downs Lord that's what life seems to be to most of us but Lord we know that in all the ups and downs God that you are always with us you promised to never leave us or forsake us Lord God and as my wife's one of my wife's favorite stories about the footprints of the sands of time when it got so dark and so Bleak and we only looked back and saw one set of footprints you could speak to us and say that's my footprints because I was carrying you oh God what a reality it is to us Lord not just a poem not just a story not just someone some something someone thought of it Lord It's a reality to us God and we thank you for it Lord through this past year and Lord if we make it to a new year which it looks like we will God but if we make it to a New Year may you just bless us in it may your hands be upon us and continue as we know you will and do God to fulfill your word and be with us Lord to never leave us or forsake us God we commit it to you Lord we are nothing in ourselves but all that we have we commit to you Lord we pray that you'd take this service into your complete control now take this vessel Lord in your complete control speak to us from these lips Lord anoint our ears to hear and reveal to us that that you'd have us to hear and say and know but we trust you in it God bless us father we commit ourselves to you we look forward God to what you're going to do continue to do for us not failing to recognize what you are doing and continuing to help us Lord we commit it to you Lord uh it's in your hands in your name the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we ask and pray these things amen Exodus 26:33 let's read this we'll let you be seated and thou shalt hang up the veil under the Tates that thou mayest bring in thither within the veil within the Veil The Ark of the testimony and the veil shall divide unto you between the holy place and the most holy and thou shalt Put The Mercy Seat upon the Ark of the testimony in the most holy Place amen you could be seated if you'd like as our subject has been and is today going Beyond the Veil amen we speak of the veil here we can recognize and not going into again all of the uh way that the Tabernacle in the wilderness was set up but we can recognize here that the the most holy place of the Tabernacle that was set up there a tabernacle of the Wilderness obviously you had the outside of the Tabernacle you had you had the the inner Court uh the outer court and the inner Court was the Holy place then you had the most holy place the most holy place was designated for the word in that most holy place behind that Veil amen which I want to get to again in just a minute because uh so if you'd like to we could turn over to numbers uh Numbers Chapter 4 in that most holy place we recognize that God had put the word the showbread which is a representation of the word and the shik glory was there in that most holy place behind that veil of badger skin which we'll read here in just a minute was the word and the spirit amen we know that that runs continuity all the way through the Bible as we've done kind of a study on that in the past of recognizing when Jesus said those that worship me must worship me in spirit and in truth we recognize that that's not just something that Jesus said that has been a precedent that has been set scripturally all through time as we know it as the as the worship of God has always been in spirit and in truth it has always been in spirit and in the word amen we read here that the Ark of the Covenant which contained the word of God was behind the veil in the most holy place in the place of the sh glory in the place where there was life amen where the life of God where where God came to to to meet with man at that time now let's go to Numbers Chapter 4 because Numbers Chapter 4 is instrumental in getting us to uh our main thought today amen of going behind that Veil going beyond that Veil amen numbers chap 4 verse 25 and 26 amen numbers 425 and 26 let's read that here and they shall bear the curtains of the Tabernacle and the curtains of the Tabernacle of the congregation his covering and the covering of the badger skins that is above it and hanging for the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation so we see the overlay these veils that that uh made the Tabernacle that made the outer court that made the inner court and into the holy place was those that were overlaid of badger skin he said above it hanging for the door the tabern Tabernacle of the congregation and the hangings of the court and the hangings of the door of the Gate of the Court which is by the Tabernacle and by the altar round about and their cords and all the instruments of their service and th all that is made for them so shall they serve now this bad skin was a very important part of what God was using in bringing Veil to the things that God was doing in this Tabernacle that very to get into the Tabernacle itself was to go past it to get into the holy place was to go past it to get into the most holy place was to get beyond the badger skin to get Beyond the Veil The Veil that God had set so that we have an that there was Entry Way amen now there was a time in this time that there was only those that God had that that God had given uh permission or allowance to go into that most holy place to go into that place where the shakana glory was to go into that place where the showbread was where the worship was of the spirit and Truth or the word and the spirit there was only that that God had consecrated Aaron and the priesthood consecrated to go into that most holy place there was the only ones that God allowed because if uh uh if someone non-concrete the priesthood went through before they could even get into that place it had to be specifically every Stitch of their garment God had orchestrated everything that they done every uh uh uh uh process that they went through and their washing and their clothing and everything that they had to do had to be P specifically as God had ordained it if it was anything out of place now listen to this now we know that we we we we have a message that a prophet brought that could drive a attack with a gun with a with a bullet from 50 yards I've never done that my life and I've hunted a lot in my life I've shot a lot of rifles and uh shotguns and such I've never driven a attack at 50 yards or Beyond amen maybe brother Tom Tommy Hunters now more than I've been maybe they've done it I've never done it but to understand that you hit a Target that big with a bullet that big from 50 yards is not a light thing to talk about it's it's not like anybody can do that amen but that's the Precision that it had to be and it echoed not just the Precision of that that just simply echoed the character of the man that God chose and the Precision that was used to bring this message to bring this word to a bride today it had to be perfectly exactly according to God's command it had to be perfectly exactly in line with every word of this Bible every as he said jot and TI every exclamation point every grammar every bit about it it had to be in perfect continuity amen so one just reflected the other well it was the same thing back here every Stitch what God specifically said of how it had to be made and what cloth or what material it had to be made of what the colors were how they were to present themselves and if there was one listen to this now if there was one stitch out of place and that man walked into that holy of holies he dropped dead one stitch you think about the Precision of the word yeah amen and people just lolly gag around with it and think well I'll just take this part not this part or I'll try to live this part but I can't live that part or you know I believe it but it just no one stitch if one word is off now we know that the scripture says you take one word away or add one word too we know what it says one word if one stitch was off and they went into that most holy place they dropped dead they they they tied a cord around them when they went into that most holy place they tied a CT around them so if one little thing was out of place and they dropped dead nobody else was going to go in behind that belt cuz they Dro dead too there would be a dead man if they try to go in there and get that man out they would drop dead as soon as they got in there so they W they they tied a quarter around him a rope around him so if he dropped dead and he fell dead something was out of place they pull him out with the Rope right cuz there wasn't anybody else going to go in there amen that's how perfect that's how Precision it had to be that's how perfect and how Precision this message had to be that's how perfect and precision it has to be in our lives this word has to be in our lives word upon word line upon line pre preep upon precept had to be that way has to be that way amen or it spells what death now you may not drop dead immediately naturally but the death today is the spiritual death for not going behind the veil now then it was death to go behind the veil anybody walked even even the ark even when David was trying to bring the ark back he was getting into the land of obeda and and the Ark tipped a little bit and a man in his righteousness of trying to protect the word in the ark put his hand on it and dropped dead because he wasn't allowed to this man and his Integrity his heart for the ark and for the word was there so much he wanted to keep it from falling over but he wasn't allowed to touch it and even in his righteous when he touched it he died amen if anybody went in behind that Veil that wasn't prepared that wasn't ready that wasn't in the position scripturally by God they dropped dead amen oh but what dwelt behind that Veil what was dwelling behind that Veil it was God God was behind that Veil that Shana Glory was behind that Veil there was life behind that Veil The Life Of God was in there and everything that God had orchestrated and told him to do brought that to pass to word God dwelt in that place amen it was an instrument that God used to be able to contact the people and God consecrated and set aside a priesthood to be able to uh uh to be in position to go behind that Veil to make intercession for the people amen and they had to follow every things line by line step by step everything had to be exactly perfect but there was such life behind that Veil there was such life let's let's go to a a let's stay we we'll stay in numbers but go over to the 17th chapter amen notice that most holy place was behind the badger skin that most holy place was behind the veil and what's the message to go Beyond the Veil well then they couldn't if they went behind the veil they dropped dead they could not go behind the veil it was death to go behind the veil amen but today we understand that if we don't go Beyond the Veil if we don't go behind that Veil it is death not to one once it was death to go behind the veil now it's death not to go behind the veil which we'll get to again a little bit later but look at the light behind this Numbers chapter 17 let's read this uh let's start with verse six I was going to just read one verse of this but I want to read more of it but numb 176 and Moses spake unto the children of Israel and every one of their princes gave him a rod of gave him a rod a peace so listen Moses spake to the children of Israel every one of their princes gave him a rod a stick amen Joel likes to collect sticks when he goes out in the what we call Woods here we don't have woods and juus on uh not by my uh standard anyway uh but when he goes out a stick maybe a dried up Cactus or something but he likes to collect sticks every time he goes out and plays at our place he comes back with a hand full of sticks walking sticks they're all these sticks rods Moses asked all the princes uh to bring one according to their father's uh houses even 12 rods and the rod of Aaron was among the rods so you got five dead dried up sticks amen the ones that Joel brings to the house I have no idea what they are I don't know where they came from I don't know what kind of tree they fell off of vegetation I have no idea it's just a dried up old stick you can't maybe a professional botanist can figure it out I can't most people I don't imagine could it's just a dried up old Dead stick you got 12 of them 12 dried up old dead sticks Moses said bring them in Aaron is one of them what's he trying to find out he's trying to find out who is God's choice cuz he was a big there's a big Todo there's always always the pride always the arrogance always the me first always I'm the one uh God chose me I I I am the selected one everybody wants to be that thing there was a a big thing going on it was very well known and we know of course by the scripture Moses knew who God chose to stand in his uh in that place of priesthood he knew but he said let okay you all you all bring of your princes you bring all your rods 12 rods ands one of them these old dead sticks we're going to find out who God approves of and who he doesn't amen little little like the ear thund them kind I guess but it was the way that God that that Moses said we're going to find out bring them all in seventh verse Moses laid up the rods before the Lord in the Tabernacle of witness and it came to pass that on the tomorrow Moses went into the Tabernacle of witness and behold the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded hallelujah praise the Lord Aaron's Rod was the one that budded and brought forth Buds and bloomed blossoms and yielded almonds praise God you want to talk about life a life that was there the life of God took an old DE dead dried up stick just like Joel brings home to our house an old dried up Dead stick and God gave it life and it budded Buds and it brought forth almonds you know what there's no questioning what Rod that came from right amen amen there's no questioning you don't have to you don't have to peradventure that this Rod came from an almond tree you know it came from an almond tree cuz when the life of God Struck it it produced almonds again praise the Lord if God can take an old dried up Dusty dry brittly old stick and bring it life what can he do for us amen they're all crusty dried up prickly cells God can bring life to that thing he can bring life to us and it can produce fruit praise God what's that fruit show that you belong to not an almond tree but you belong to the family of God that's because that's the kind of fruit you produce amen that's the fruit that comes out of these old dried up beans is the fruit of God and it shows to the world it shows to the world that's a Christian that's a man of God that's a sister that's a daughter of God they're producing ing the fruit of God Amen how shall men know who the son of man am amen how should they know us amen how do we know a tree that's out in in the world a bush a plant amen am it brings forth life when you bring forth life there's no question the question the question's over because it brings forth the life of God if it brings forth the life of God then it's God showing himself through you budding himself out through you but that's the life that was behind in this shik Glory the life of God took an old Dead stick and brought it to life then there was no question who God's choice was because all the other rods just stayed dead rotten sticks amen but God's choice God's decision Aaron's rod budded and brought forth alond amen that showed the the per the Perfection of God in veiled in that Shak of Glory veiled in that holies of holies amen this man that God chose was a man that could go in there had to be perfect exactly right according to the scripture go in behind that Veil amen and that's where God met with him on behalf of the people that's why that's why that priesthood was there that was the whole point to go behind the veil to stand in the Gap to be there as as a as a gap between between God and the people amen God made that way it was God's choice it was God's decision God made that uh uh decision amen God also made another decision God made a decision to send his only begotten son into this world his only begotten son amen now I hear a lot of times people say God's only son I I understand what they're saying but we got to understand that Jesus was his only begotten son I'm a Son of God but I didn't come into the world to save the world from their sins I didn't come into the world to save be men's Souls but the only begotten son Jesus Christ did that was God's choice God made that choice to send his only only begotten son who the word veiled in flesh the word veiled in flesh to the point the world could not see it his own people didn't know it they were blinded to it amen they were blinded they didn't see who he was to his like the song says to his own a stranger is it this the son of Joseph and Mary isn't this the a carpenter isn't this this whatever excuses they wanted to make but he was almighty God veiled in Bader skin veiled in flesh prophesied to be so Isaiah Isaiah chapter 9 verse 6 For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given praise God best gift I ever got amen best gift I ever got wasn't on Christmas either amen but it's the best gift I ever got a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God Amen let's see trinitarians try to do away with that one amen Jesus Christ is the Mighty God Amen I I read one time I can't remember if brother brandom said it or where I heard it but brother the Billy Graham made a proclamation of that when he was preaching one time and said Jesus Christ is the Mighty God and they and and there was people came against him hard for that and you know what is you know what his uh uh answer was that's what the scripture says amen that's right that's what the scripture says you can try to tear them into three pieces all you want but that's what the Bible says amen he is the Mighty God he's the Everlasting father now wait a minute I thought he was the son of God Amen the Everlasting fathers the Prince of Peace Jesus Christ come people didn't recognize it me and the family went over to Winter Haven would you do a lot of times go look at the lights Pretty Lights beautiful lights amen gets it gets more worldly all the time but it pretty lights uh twinkling glowing you know pretty light you see every once in a while every once in a while you see a nativity scene too not very often anymore but every once in a while me and Joel got to the place we were kind of looking this one no this one Happ no this one have no he saw more than I did some of them were little and he saw very few there was some there was some there that were promoting Jesus there was people in the street singing Christian songs which with crosses lit up which I like very much but um but you saw very very little of that anymore and the ones you saw most of them most of the nativities are wrong anyway because they had the mai coming to Jesus in a manger bringing gifts and we know we' proved that scripturally to be wrong they couldn't have wise men uh the uh Shepherds but not the wise men not with the gifts now had the gifts coming in laying at Jesus feet so even a lot of times the nativities are wrong amen but you see that worldly expression that people have it's become it it's become that because that's what it bred out of Christmas bred out of paganism and that's what it's come to amen I we celebrate Jesus birth and uh I I kind of liken it to my wife we celebrate my wife's birthday on J on July 10th we have no idea when she was born but we celebrate on July 10th amen I'm not sure when Jesus was born brother random told us in the springtime amen where all Lambs come forth I believe that amen I believe that to be the truth makes uh well I don't like to say the word sense but it makes sense if you look at it a lamb is to come forth is supposed to come forth uh uh in the springtime and that makes sense but exactly what what day what month we don't know absolutely for sure but we celebrate because we're thankful that he was born because if he hadn't been born he couldn't live if he hadn't lived he couldn't have died if he hadn't have died he couldn't have come back and if he hadn't come back I wouldn't have him living in me amen amen I'd be a man most miserable still today if I didn't have Jesus Christ Living in me amen so praise the Lord for that we're thankful in flesh Jesus Jesus the word in flesh Jesus was that Veil Jesus was that that that body was the badger skin that was that was hiding the shakana glory that was blocking that was holding people from seeing holding eyes people are seeing that that was God there a baby laying in a man a boy Carpenter wood a boy telling his mother I must be about my father's business and that wasn't building houses that wasn't building Furniture wasn't carpentry work amen because he knew who he was praise the Lord when the devil tried to come and tempt him he knew exactly who he was he told the devil who he was devil knew who he was amen but he had he told him anyway he knows who you are but he still tries to tempt you he still tries to try you he still tries to overthrow you every single chance he gives he sends every little menion and he can possibly muster up to try to get to go your way again no matter how bad they've been beat up no matter how much they've been defeated no matter how hard they've been uh uh put down in ridicule they still keep coming but you know what he still a loser that's right he's still going to go away from me defeated he's still going to go away from us beaten and scorned amen because through Christ we're already made Victorious that's right Jesus Christ healed the word Jesus Christ healed God he was the badger skin amen the badger skin that hid Jesus Christ let's go over to Matthew chap 27 the badger skin that hid Jesus Matthew chapter 27 the badger skin that hid skin that hid the word let me read you this quote before we go uh into Matthew 26 and read there let me read this quote to you in the Hebrew series 1957 brother bam said the veil is the flesh the veil is what keeps us from seeing God face to face in this church amen I didn't print it you know brother random said if this veil of Flesh were to drop off right now you'd see God standing before you amen why because he knew who he was amen now do we know who we are if the veil of this flesh were to drop off who is there amen if Newton Bennett's dead it sure can't be him because that's only thing I have to identify this flesh is Newton Bennett if this fell of Flesh were to drop off who would be here if he were to drop off who would you see amen that's why we must go Beyond the Veil sort of like we said on our last part two we were talking about it go beyond that Veil go beyond that flesh let let God help us to see one another the way he sees us because God doesn't see this nasty thing amen we must look beyond that Veil we must look beyond that flesh look the veil is the FL the veil is what keeps us from seeing God face to face in this church the veil is what keeps us from seeing the Angels at their positions this morning like we talked about with Elisha and Gazza amen the Angels the camp the the Chariots of Fire all around there's more with us they're all with them we went through that last I think it was last time in their position standing by the seats standing by the seats amen he's talking about the seats in the church there at that time there is in Jeffersonville standing by the seats the angels of God their position the veil is what keeps us from seeing him we are hid behind the veil and that Veil is the flesh we are Sons and Daughters of God we're in the presence of God the angels of God are encamped about those who fear Him we're in the presence of God all the time I'll never leave thee neither will I ever forsake thee I'll be with thee always even to the end but the Veil is the flesh that's what keeps us out of his presence amen or seeing him face to face if you will now look Matthew chapter 27 I won't be too much longer Matthew 27:1 15 Jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up The Ghost and behold the veil of the Temple praise the Lord amen the veil of the temple was rent in Twain From the top to the bottom and the Earth did quake and the Rocks did ran the veil of the temple remember it was death to go behind that Veil one time but now it's death not to the veil of the temple was rent in Twain and brought into PL view God almighty so we could be able to have entrance into that place into that shagana Glory into that holies of holies we now have permission we now have ability we now have God to be able to go in behind that Veil and unless we go behind that Veil today it's death praise the Lord today the world thinks they have life the life that's a simulation of God's life has been perverted to death so death is groping the world today we know control over multitudes unfortunately of people multitudes and God help me I got to be honest things I go to places with lots of people airport pray for me if you would please airport like the lights places that have a lot of people restaurant or something I feel sometimes like I'm getting more cynical and Lord help me I fight it don't want to be that way sin is becoming so prevalent sin has be got such a hold of people I was setting I I got to be honest with you I was setting not that I'd lie to you but uh full disclosure I I believe it was in the airport the other day and especially especially when children come by when I see children come by Joel and him his age or even Ruth and I see parents that they're pierc everywhere they're tattooed everywhere they're smoking or whatever it is hair is combed over and cut off this side I'm trying to say this without being cynical now or or men with buns or and I see the children I think what chance does that child have with an influence like that what is that child going to become brother random talks about the flappers daughter becoming a strip teas becoming a so on and so forth what is that what chance is that poor child I literally I I got full disclosure I believe it's an airport i s in airport the other day day and I just started crying I could not control myself uh fortunately uh the guy that lives in town that works with me on my team he usually Chatters all the time he was quiet he wasn't saying anything because I couldn't have answered it and it just came over my heart it just it it it gried me so the sin of this world and people are just going to Hell by the millions and it's hard to watch it's hard to be in this place and see that going on and not feel something tug at your heart and make you feel God if it was just something I could do and if it could be done he would have done it because he's done all he can do it comes our choice it becomes our decision that we make are we going to follow him are we going to follow the world are we going to pattern ourselves after the world people talk about not doing this not doing that you know the number one thing I look at the brother random actually gave instruction to said do not pattern yourself after the world Amen that's some of the that's one of the best Pops I think I've I've read as far as life living amen don't pattern yourself after the world the world trend is this don't pattern yourself after that amen my wife can tell you my my my children can tell you I'm probably the first person from that I've never been a fad person I've never been someone to follow along if somebody's wearing a certain Jean or a shirt have whatever the ponytailer I've never been somebody to follow follow fads uh I've never cared about it it it's just I'm just me and that's all I know to tell people it's just me but it come on my heart so strong the other day I couldn't do anything but Cry tears just started come out of my eyes I can I couldn't stop it eventually obviously I was but I try my I try not to get to the place that I'm that it becomes so cynical because it's it's hard to see people so lost so lost but it's it's understandable to know that if it weren't for the grace of God in my life I'd be as lost as them if not for God's grace there go I I don't want to get self-righteous or condenscending or think I'm better or more important because I'm not amen I'm just his son and I just want to live to the position that he's called for me to live and that's all I know when I die that'll be it amen and I hope that I could get there and it says well done my good and faithful servant other words I want to hear the most well done my good and faithful servant that's what I want to hear praise the Lord Jesus Christ come bailed in pleasure the veil of the temple was rent in Twain now we got to go beyond that Veil amen into that sh of Glory into that holies of holies into that most holy Place amen because the veil was rent it was wide open for anybody and everybody amen amen Come All Ye all all are welcome the graves were open many bodies of the Saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection went into the holy city and appeared unto many praise the Lord because the veil was torn into two providing full access providing full access to God it was death to go behind the veil now it's death not to go behind the veil it was death to not to go beyond it and ask death not to go beyond it amen you know when brother Ram tells a story when his wife hope died his uh U first wife when she died I've been to the Grave I've been i' I've I've stood next to the stump that's a stump now the tree he talks about and he stood there as they lowered her body down into that grave and as he stood there and watched them lower that body into that grave she came up beside him and put her arm in his oh hallelujah amen did you imagine put her arm in his God allowed him to go at that moment Beyond the Veil to see her there to recognize her there and her presence there as they and she I I guess you would say in that other dimension stood there with him and watched him lower that body into that hole amen beyond that Veil they were able to go she he was able to go beyond that Veil to see that it still tormented him obviously as he tells many times but being able to go beyond that helped him get to that place oh you know how many times he talks about our loved ones being with us and if if well like Elisha told Gaza like told God G about Gesa God open his eyes open his eyes that he can see and when God opened G eyes he can see all the the the Chariots of Fire all the hills all around Amen to recognize it we know scripturally that those angels of God are encamped around about those that fear him here this morning if we could go beyond that Veil brother talked about that Veil as I just read that Veil is the Flesh and being able to get beyond that the veil of the temple Christ Jesus God coming in a Manger God coming veiled in the body of a baby to bring the world life to bring the world salvation to bring the world forgiveness and people don't moment what other religion what other sect following leader preacher do you see that talks about the need of being saved they talk about some of them being a good person being a nice moral person how to get your body into physical shape yoga and such getting your mind into shape and and being kind and that's all good that's fine but which other ones talks about a man that come to die to open that place for all of humanity to be able to come to if they will to receive that life to receive forgiveness to receive salvation amen it's there it's full free it's for anybody and everybody however we want God made the way the veil of the temple was rent in Twain From the top to the bottom now it's up to us to go beyond that Veil and it is death not to amen oh God help us today it was blinded to the world and the world a lot of what the world sees today is still just a baby Jesus that's all he means to a lot of people is just being a baby Jesus just stay in your place just just basically there's a just stay in that manger leave me alone I'll talk to you again next December 25th but leave me alone just stay in that manger just stay a baby because they don't want him as their lord they don't want him the rest of the year they're un un incapable to go beyond that bail you know brother random said that Jesus Christ come to redeem those that were redeemable amen what is that means that means he came to redeem those that were redeemable means there's those that are not redeemable amen they'll never see it God help us amen but go beyond that veil in our lives in our everyday lives go beyond that Veil that's where we should live living beyond that Veil where the temple was the veil of the temple was rent amen it's open for all of us praise the Lord people don't see a lot of that the birth of Jesus but that that bail was rent for us to go free access amen praise the lord it's got to be word upon word it's got to be line upon line it can't be word upon your opinion it can't be word upon your thoughts can't be lying upon your your decisions it has to be word on Word line on line precept on precept here little there little his him not mine not anybody else's not any other Christian person preacher Pastor amen it's got to be him praise the Lord him and his word 100% praise the Lord let's stand if we could God give us the ability the way to go behind that Veil amen and I'm so thankful today that we have the ability we have the opportunity The Chance by choice to do that to go beyond that Veil amen that God has set for
