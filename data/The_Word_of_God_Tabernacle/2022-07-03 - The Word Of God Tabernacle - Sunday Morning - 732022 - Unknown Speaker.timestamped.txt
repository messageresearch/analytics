[11:15] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[11:17] pray amen amen amen praise the lord you
[11:21] could be seated if you like
[11:25] amen i know it seems like they
[11:27] said that the
[11:29] patriotism i guess of our country is
[11:31] kind of diminished to a point but you
[11:33] know i just attribute it sometimes to
[11:36] um
[11:37] it's kind of like having skin in the
[11:38] game as they would say
[11:41] you know back when this country was
[11:43] founded and
[11:44] men and women fought for its freedom
[11:47] they had skin in the game it's kind of
[11:48] like church
[11:50] amen
[11:51] if you don't have skin in the game it's
[11:53] just a place to come sometimes
[11:55] you know you know it doesn't really mean
[11:57] a whole lot but if you give of your time
[11:59] and your effort and your finances and
[12:01] your prayers and all that you do for it
[12:04] then you've got skin in the game that
[12:05] means something to you yes amen when you
[12:08] got it the same thing in this country
[12:10] they had skin in the gay literal life
[12:13] depended on it
[12:14] uh patrick henry give me your liberty or
[12:17] give me death amen you know because if
[12:18] they had been caught and
[12:21] the british had won they would have been
[12:23] hung and
[12:24] uh
[12:25] whatever other manner of death they
[12:27] would have put to them but
[12:29] uh but thank god there had to be a
[12:31] freedom
[12:32] of liberty
[12:33] you know they had it today and i believe
[12:35] it was the same thing it's like serving
[12:37] in the military or something like that
[12:39] those men and women they have they have
[12:41] skin in the game they they respect it
[12:43] because they fought for its freedoms
[12:46] uh and today is i believe it's the same
[12:48] thing spiritually
[12:49] so i believe that's why we're here today
[12:51] too yes so we'll just sing us

[21:30] uh sister julian prayer she's still
[21:32] struggling with some uh physical issues
[21:35] that she's just
[21:36] it's been very tough on her
[21:39] um so please remember her in prayer um
[21:42] going into detail unless she asked me to
[21:44] about it but she's been struggling
[21:46] mightily
[21:47] with some physical issues so please
[21:50] uh
[21:51] please remember sister julie in prayer
[21:53] we also want to continue remember sister
[21:55] savannah in prayer and maybe or uh
[21:59] cheyenne excuse me well all of them all
[22:01] the frauds of course all of us but
[22:04] cheyenne we um
[22:06] whether whether she ever goes back home
[22:07] or not i want to hear
[22:10] right amen and i want to see her back in
[22:12] church that's to me that's what matters
[22:14] the most family's fine that's all good
[22:16] but there's a time you leave family and
[22:18] we've all left family almost all of them
[22:20] at some point in time but the main thing
[22:22] is to be in in the house of the lord and
[22:26] serving and worshiping the lord so
[22:27] that's the thing that matters the most
[22:29] so please continue to remember her in
[22:31] prayer amen sister matisse had her did
[22:33] you have a prayer request
[22:34] yeah i do my daughter and i had a
[22:37] falling out based on some lies that were
[22:40] told when she was 12 years old
[22:42] she was born in 1981
[22:45] and
[22:46] i'm arguing with a 12 year old
[22:50] child's memory and she didn't have all
[22:54] the facts
[22:56] and
[22:57] and it's
[22:58] just split us up
[22:59] and um i'm just
[23:02] i tried to present it to her and
[23:04] anyway it's
[23:07] i'm just praying that god would just
[23:09] intervene
[23:10] in some way and
[23:12] and um
[23:13] allow us to
[23:15] she cut me off
[23:19] so i was praying that god
[23:23] um
[23:24] you know
[23:25] i gave her the proof
[23:27] i gave her the proof that those were
[23:28] lies
[23:30] and um and i just
[23:32] i'm just praying that god will just i'm
[23:34] gonna send her a letter and just pray
[23:36] that god will just
[23:38] help us through this amen so that you
[23:41] can be healed i believe he will
[23:42] especially have her heal because she's
[23:44] dealing with
[23:46] some beliefs that are incorrect
[24:03] amen
[24:04] i appreciate your prayers for
[24:06] me in fact maybe at the end of service

[24:13] excruciating
[24:15] um
[24:16] killing me even now but by the grace of
[24:18] god
[24:20] we press forward
[24:21] but uh it might it just happens i don't
[24:24] know why every three or four months or
[24:25] something i slouch or whatever i do or i
[24:28] don't know
[24:29] uh
[24:30] it can be one side or the other but this
[24:32] time i barely was able to take a shower
[24:34] this morning
[24:35] uh but i appreciate your prayers for
[24:37] that if you would
[24:38] amen it just kind of goes down my back
[24:40] and takes my breath away even
[24:43] but um
[24:44] but by the grace of god amen by his
[24:46] stripes we are healed amen anyone have
[24:49] an unspoken request on your heart
[24:52] this hurts
[24:53] brother let's stand brother dennis would
[24:55] you pray for these needs
[24:58] today lord jesus in unison with our
[25:02] heads and our hearts for your
[25:05] presence your holy presence knowing that
[25:09] father you're mindful of each and every
[25:12] one yes you're not partial you're not
[25:16] one to select certain ones and reject
[25:19] others long we come through your
[25:21] precious blood we're all excited yes
[25:24] amen
[25:25] and lord i was reading about
[25:28] paul was talking about i have no
[25:31] confidence in the flesh
[25:34] and me the more so paul was saying by
[25:37] hebrew hebrews circumcised by the
[25:41] the benjamin and tribe and just
[25:44] just brought up um with the scriptures
[25:48] and knowing it back
[25:49] backwards and forwards and then he
[25:52] recognized as he met you a living god
[25:55] you have to lose all that you have to
[25:58] die to himself that you may be able to
[26:01] use them for your honor and for your
[26:03] glory how much more should it speak to
[26:06] our hearts that we need to die out we
[26:09] need to be
[26:10] out of the way that you may be able to
[26:13] work your holy spirit your will in us
[26:16] father
[26:17] and i'm even convinced that much more as
[26:20] our pastor even said already i'll make
[26:22] the hour and people's hearts are failing
[26:26] for fear and people are wondering uh how
[26:29] much worse can it get and we know
[26:32] according to your word the ones that
[26:35] reject your word your vindicated truth
[26:39] for this day the worst is yet to come
[26:43] and lord help us to recognize to put you
[26:46] first to be dedicated to be consecrated
[26:51] truth
[26:52] we say
[26:53] lord that we want to be better
[26:55] christians but let our hearts speak for
[26:58] itself not just words but just fall uh
[27:02] yes deaf ears but let it be our living
[27:05] truth lord in this late hour lord unless
[27:09] you reveal yourself to us we're going to
[27:12] continue the way we are
[27:14] it's like brother brown and your prophet
[27:16] said it's not the big things were we
[27:19] failed god it's the little things we
[27:22] leave undone and and how he said how can
[27:25] i teach you algebra if you don't know
[27:28] your abcs and lord speak to our hearts
[27:32] we're here in your house to draw closer
[27:36] to you to become better christians to be
[27:41] better prepared for a rapture amen it's
[27:44] a reality only to the bride your prophet
[27:47] said and lord there are some that are
[27:50] sick
[27:51] this morning that need a touch from you
[27:54] our sister julie
[27:56] at home screaming lord oh may you come
[28:00] under sea and give her her heart's
[28:02] desire may you deliver from all that
[28:06] she's going through for thou art truly a
[28:09] high priest that can be touched by the
[28:12] feelings of our infirmities and with
[28:15] your sights we are healed and made that
[28:17] healing touch reach out to each and
[28:20] every one that needs a touch from you
[28:23] father

[28:28] know as we pray that you met us along
[28:31] the way father

[28:47] joys may be full that their cup
[28:51] runeth over that the testimonies will
[28:54] come forth and you're truly with us yes
