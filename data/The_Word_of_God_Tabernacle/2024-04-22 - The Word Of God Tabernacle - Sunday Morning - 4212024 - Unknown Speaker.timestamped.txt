[29:30] Greece um for a pretty exensive vacation

[29:43] is where the Corinthians were and
[29:46] Ephesus wasians were and I would like
[29:49] while I'm there uh if the Lord could
[29:51] just show me where the biblical things
[29:56] occur I don't any of the tour
[29:58] information they have are going to
[29:59] contain that so I would really like to
[30:02] just kind of that voice inside of us
[30:05] that kind of directs us just speak to me
[30:08] so I can kind of maybe bring some of
[30:11] that back stories

[30:34] remember so please remember that prayer
[30:36] we'll be with us next Sunday so but just
[30:42] thankful want to do
[30:47] it
[30:53] come Joel got St by be the other day and
[30:56] had an infection come out
[30:59] um
[31:01] so he's taking some medicine
[31:04] for pray I'm sure it's been painful for
[31:07] him
[31:09] hard devil just keeps attacking little
[31:12] that a
[31:17] liar service
[31:22] over the Lord is mindful as long as
[31:25] God's hands on that's what matter the
[31:27] Lord
[31:28] so
[31:32] pleas let's stand to our feet if we
[31:36] could take these knees to the
[31:38] Lord Lord Jesus for
[31:44] all Lord Jesus I can recall that the
[31:49] prophet David said I was glad when he
[31:51] said unto me let us go house yes we know
[31:56] father as our ping mentioned already
[31:59] enemy is fighting this harder than he he
[32:03] has fought in this whole time of the
[32:06] existence oh yes and father you said
[32:09] when Satan comes in like a flood he'll
[32:12] raise a standard yes Lord and we know
[32:15] father greater he that's in us than he
[32:18] that's in the world you know that's your
[32:20] promise your promises will not fail us
[32:23] Lord and Lord we need to recognize that
[32:28] it took one word this place out of place
[32:33] when Satan was speaking to Eve that
[32:36] cause all this sin on the Earth but
[32:39] father it was your plan to come forth as
[32:42] a savior oh God thank you and Lord it
[32:45] takes one word to uh be misplaced or uh
[32:51] just not in the right place to keep us
[32:55] off away from you and away from your
[32:58] word away from serving you in the right
[33:01] way yes Lord I can recall it in the
[33:05] father ever learning and never able to
[33:08] come to the knowledge of the
[33:11] truth as jamus and jambers we stood
[33:15] Moses so are they a reate mind
[33:19] concerning the faith Jesus and Lord
[33:22] that's what fighting us harder than ever
[33:25] Lord that maybe someone to say you know
[33:29] I don't need to come to
[33:31] church I can listen to the tapes I can
[33:35] listen to the pastor
[33:39] online and we know father that if you
[33:43] can't make it this is your place of Duty
[33:46] yes Lord there some that are said father
[33:49] that's
[33:50] understandable but father it's time to
[33:53] recognize the day and the message and
[33:56] the hour that were
[33:59] to resist the devil that he'll flee from
[34:02] us to think that we can do something
[34:07] that we know that the word says
[34:10] different then that's iniquity and we
[34:14] know at the end you have some to come up
[34:17] to you can I do this for you Lord I go
[34:21] out the mission field then I pay more
[34:25] ties than than anyone then I um just uh
[34:31] become a a real Christian everywhere I
[34:34] went but you'll say to them depart from
[34:38] me you workers
[34:40] of for I never knew you Lord it has to
[34:44] be you control you know that same

[34:58] you a pilot has the plane under control
[35:02] yes Lord father copilot just listens and
[35:06] and obeys what the pilot wants him to do
[35:09] and that's how we need to even come
[35:12] before you in prayer we need to obey you
[35:16] father and just listen to what you want
[35:18] us to do you said in your word if two
[35:23] shall agree touching anything it shall
[35:26] come to pass amen yes if my words

[46:16] spirit that would try to hurt H or
[46:18] infiltrate this service in any way that
[46:20] you would get the glory and praise for
[46:22] all that is said and done here today
[46:25] Lord may your Holy Spirit Come come
[46:27] sweep through this place as we felt so
[46:29] far Lord and do that exceeding
[46:31] abundantly above all that we could ever

[46:59] of our desires our wants or needs Lord
[47:02] are all encapsulated in you Lord we just
[47:06] commit ourselves to you now fully truly
[47:09] holy in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[47:12] praise the Lord Romans chapter 14 we'll
[47:15] start with verse
[47:17] one Romans
[47:20] 141 him that has weakened the faith
[47:23] receive ye but not to doubtful
[47:25] disputations for one believeth that he
[47:27] may eat all things another who is weak
[47:30] eateth hers let not him that eateth
[47:33] despise him that eateth not and let not
[47:35] him which eateth not judge him that
[47:37] eateth for God hath received him who art
[47:41] thou that judgest another man's servant
[47:44] to his own Master he standeth or fth Y
[47:47] he shall be Holden up for God is able to
[47:50] make him stand one man esteemeth one day
[47:53] above another another esteemeth every
[47:55] day alike let every man be fully
[47:57] persuaded in his own mind he that
[48:00] regardeth the day regardeth it unto the
[48:02] Lord and He that regardeth not the day
[48:05] to the Lord he does not regard it he
[48:08] that eateth eateth to the Lord for he
[48:10] giveth God thanks and he that eateth not
[48:12] to the Lord he eateth not and giveth God
[48:15] thanks for none of us live to ourselves
[48:17] and no man dieth to himself for for
[48:21] whether we live we live unto the Lord
[48:24] whether we die we die unto the Lord
[48:26] whether we live therefore or die we are
[48:29] the Lords amen man you can be seated if
[48:31] you
[48:33] like and that's what
[48:37] matters that we are his amen that we
[48:41] belong to the Lord it comes along
[48:44] especially it seems like quite a spirit
[48:48] in the message especially in the message
[48:50] I would say but even amongst
[48:51] Christianity and not to negate or to
[48:55] lessen any of the importance of
[48:57] following and living the scripture and
[49:00] and uh the the uh the Commandments of
[49:04] God that he's given us not to negate or
[49:06] to lessen any of those things but we do
[49:09] recognize that we belong to God that God
[49:12] made us the way he made us he made us in
[49:14] our own unusual way every one of us is
[49:17] different amen but we mesh together as
[49:21] one group and that's the way it's
[49:23] supposed to be see the Bible says here
[49:26] and that is is weak in the faith receive
[49:28] that person amen because they're still
[49:31] in the faith yes even though they may be
[49:34] weak in the faith they're still in the
[49:36] faith amen receive that person because
[49:40] they're still in the faith that's right
[49:42] and don't do it to doubtful disputations
[49:44] don't do it to the point you say okay
[49:47] well we receive him but we don't think
[49:50] he's going to last long oh we don't
[49:52] think he's got what it takes oh we don't
[49:54] think that that person's ever going to
[49:56] become anything we don't think that
[49:58] person's going to hang on very long
[50:00] that's doubtful disputation oh we
[50:02] receive him but we judge him to the
[50:05] place that we say well because he's not
[50:07] doing it exactly the way I think it
[50:09] should be done he's not going to make it
[50:10] or he's not part of God or he's not
[50:13] really a Christian Saints anything as
[50:15] long as it's according to the scripture
[50:18] we're all in different ways amen we all
[50:21] uh uh are different people God did not
[50:25] God did not determine before the
[50:27] foundation of the world to make every
[50:29] one of us cookie cutter Christians as
[50:31] I've said before many times God is Not
[50:34] determined to make us cookie cutter
[50:36] Christians he didn't just come out with
[50:38] a hole and have a stamp in every one of
[50:40] us he just stamped along an assembly
[50:42] line and that person just spit out
[50:44] another robot and there's another robot
[50:46] and there's he supposed to be exactly
[50:48] the same way supposed to be the same
[50:49] height look same buil same out that's
[50:52] not the way God's body's made up and
[50:54] it's not that way because every one of
[50:56] us are supposed to fulfill our own
[50:59] particular uh calling that God has given
[51:01] us in life we all have a calling if we
[51:04] belong to God we all have a calling we
[51:07] all have a purpose we all have a gift we
[51:10] all have something that God has for us
[51:12] to do when we're here on this Earth and
[51:15] if anybody tries to negate or downplay
[51:17] or put out any of those things they are
[51:20] wrong amen because there's not a gift in
[51:23] the spirit that's in the scripture not
[51:26] one gift that's in the scripture that
[51:29] calls for someone to be the one to lay
[51:32] the hammer down and say okay my gift is
[51:34] to determine that you're not going to
[51:36] make it that's not a gift in the Bible
[51:40] excuse me but it seems like that that's
[51:42] a gift that a lot of people seem to have
[51:45] and that's the sad part just because
[51:48] they might not be just like you or do
[51:50] this particular thing just like you or
[51:53] because as the Bible said or because you
[51:56] eat meat and I don't think you should do
[51:57] that or that you uh regard this certain
[52:01] day or whatever and I don't think you
[52:03] should do that well that's your choice
[52:05] amen but it's not against the word if
[52:08] it's not against the word why are you
[52:09] coming against me about it I'm not
[52:11] talking about anything sinful friends
[52:14] but things that everybody just do does a
[52:16] little differently amen and we're that
[52:19] way for a purpose we all come from
[52:22] different parts of this country I think
[52:24] everybody here was born in the United
[52:26] States except my wife and she's just
[52:28] barely crossed the border but everybody
[52:30] was born but we're all born in different
[52:33] places we're all had different
[52:35] upbringings we all had different things
[52:37] that we went through in life we all had
[52:39] different friends we all lived in
[52:40] different neighborhoods we've all had
[52:42] different educations we all had
[52:43] different jobs we've all come up through
[52:45] different parents maybe one parent in a
[52:48] home maybe both parents I don't know
[52:50] maybe broken home maybe not broken home
[52:52] I don't know but we've all come through
[52:54] different things but it's that way for
[52:56] Reason God Made it that way for a
[52:59] purpose I was telling uh Sonia this
[53:01] morning that uh about my upbringing and
[53:05] you know I had really good friends
[53:06] growing up and I love my friends and I
[53:08] didn't think I'd ever be when I was
[53:10] growing up I didn't think I'd ever be in
[53:12] life without my good buddies without my
[53:14] good friends we did things together we
[53:17] went places uh we were always outside
[53:21] digging in the mud or swimming in the
[53:23] pond or getting croads and salamanders
[53:26] out of the Creek or riding the bikes or
[53:28] or or playing a sport football baseball
[53:31] basketball always doing something always
[53:33] together going on Tri trips together and
[53:35] I thought these would be my buddies
[53:37] these would be my friends for the rest
[53:38] of my life and I was telling my wife I
[53:40] said now they weren't they weren't they
[53:42] didn't grow up to be the kind of person
[53:45] that I am they're not ministers I I
[53:47] don't know that any of them serve the
[53:49] Lord now uh they probably considered
[53:51] themselves Christians although being
[53:53] nominally Christian uh but they weren't
[53:55] would not have been very good influences
[53:58] but the Lord had it that way for a
[54:00] reason amen because he had to mold me in
[54:04] the way that he wanted me to do to
[54:06] fulfill a certain purpose in my life and
[54:09] every one of us God has done the same
[54:11] way to fulfill a certain purpose in life
[54:14] not everybody is supposed to stand up
[54:17] behind the pull pit and preach the
[54:18] gospel but every one of us are supposed
[54:20] to go out that door and preach the
[54:22] gospel with our lives to the rest of
[54:24] humanity amen amen not every one of us
[54:27] is supposed to have a gift of of tongues
[54:30] not every one of us is supposed to have
[54:32] a gift of Prophecy not every one of us
[54:34] supposed to have the gift of helps but
[54:36] God puts those in the body so that every
[54:39] one of us flourish so that we all come
[54:42] to the same place it's like I was saying
[54:44] about uh uh mentioning even about the
[54:47] BIOS we friends we we're just all in
[54:50] this we're just all in this journey
[54:52] together we all love the Lord we all
[54:55] want to with all of our hearts we all
[54:58] want to make Heaven our home we we all
[55:01] want to we all want to live the life
[55:03] that that that God would have us live
[55:05] and be pleasing to the Lord and we've
[55:07] all had different backgrounds and things
[55:09] that we've come through but every one of
[55:11] us really want the same thing out of
[55:14] life I think if you
[55:15] pull don't matter how divided this
[55:18] country is mainly it seems like
[55:20] politically now but it don't matter how
[55:23] divided it is I bet if you ask most
[55:25] Americans in this country what is the
[55:28] thing that you would want out of life I
[55:30] would imagine most of the people
[55:32] probably 70 upwards of probably over 70
[55:36] 75% of people would say I just want to
[55:39] have a good life I just want to be
[55:42] healthy uh uh uh live comfortably uh
[55:45] maybe on a house maybe not you getting a
[55:47] little specifics about house car and
[55:49] things like that but people just want to
[55:51] be happy people just want to live their
[55:53] lives people just want to uh uh to to to
[55:56] be comfortable in life and just enjoy
[55:58] life amen we just want to serve God we
[56:02] just want to live for God I just want to
[56:05] give God everything I've got do I slip
[56:07] yeah do I fall yeah do I make mistakes
[56:09] yeah but praise God I get back up and I
[56:11] keep going on the same Journey the Lord
[56:13] put me on to start with just because I
[56:15] fail doesn't mean I'm lost right just
[56:18] because you fail doesn't mean you're
[56:19] lost if it if it was I'd have been gone
[56:22] a long time ago right amen every one of
[56:25] us just keep going get up and keep going
[56:28] just keep just keep on that same Journey
[56:31] yeah another trial comes another thing
[56:33] happens Satan's not going to leave you
[56:35] alone but God uses that to mold us yeah
[56:39] God uses that to increase our faith God
[56:41] uses that to help bring us to the place
[56:43] that we need to be because it's going to
[56:45] take more than what we've got now for a
[56:47] changing of a body and a Rapture to take
[56:49] place amen that's the word god brings
[56:53] that word but when we start putting one
[56:55] another down and put one another route
[56:57] we work so hard to try to win souls to
[57:00] Christ and next thing you know we're
[57:02] working even harder to try to P somebody
[57:05] out just because they don't see it the
[57:06] way we do right I mean that sounds more
[57:10] counterproductive how is that edifying
[57:12] to the body of Christ when we're trying
[57:15] to shove people out just because they
[57:16] don't see it or act like it or look
[57:18] whatever the way we do again nothing
[57:20] sinful I'm not talking about that but
[57:22] just because they don't come to our mold
[57:25] of what they we think they should be I
[57:28] had some now I'm going to say
[57:30] something if you disagree that's okay
[57:33] that we we can disagree can't we and we
[57:35] can still be Christians and we can still
[57:37] love one another you can still be my
[57:39] brother or sister amen but I heard
[57:41] someone say one time that because they
[57:43] had the Holy Ghost they should all be
[57:44] acting the
[57:46] same scripturally yes but I disagree
[57:50] with that because I'm different than
[57:52] that person yes Amen brother random like
[57:56] to fish and hunt and I loved it growing
[57:58] up but I hadn't fished and hunted in I
[57:59] don't know how long I haven't I haven't
[58:01] gone hunting I've shot guns with our
[58:05] friends we had the the Alderson we used
[58:07] to go out in the desert and shoot with
[58:09] guns and uh pistols rifles shotguns
[58:11] whatever and just mik goes sometimes to
[58:14] shooting range with his friends and they
[58:16] shoot and stuff like that but I haven't
[58:17] actually been hunting to go hunting for
[58:20] animal in a countless years maybe even
[58:23] since I was in North Carolina growing up
[58:25] as a boy I was out in the woods all the
[58:27] time hunting or fishing I would get up
[58:29] at 6:00 in the morning on sun on the
[58:31] summer break I would go down to a local
[58:33] pond I catch some fish come home and
[58:36] clean them and cook them and uh cook son
[58:39] you may not he cut the potatoes and the
[58:42] french fries I'd make my my lunch from
[58:45] the fish I just got out of the pond and
[58:47] that was my life I love doing that but I
[58:49] haden't done that in Years brother Ram
[58:52] love to do it people around the message
[58:53] oh my if you don't hunt you're not a m M
[58:56] believer seems like sometimes in some
[58:58] circles anyway if you don't go hunt you
[59:01] how could you if you don't drive a Ford
[59:02] how could you be how could you be a CHR
[59:04] how can you believe a believer of this
[59:06] message not drive a
[59:08] forward it it gets to that point see and
[59:11] I you probably known some of those
[59:12] people I know some of those people if
[59:15] you don't see it like this then you're
[59:16] just not a part of it see I just
[59:18] disagree with that I still want to
[59:20] consider those people my brother and
[59:22] sister I still hope and pray that they
[59:24] consider me their brother and sister
[59:27] receive them not to doubtful
[59:30] disputations some have this some have
[59:32] that but we're all one don't put that
[59:34] one out because they don't see it the
[59:36] way you do don't put that one because
[59:38] they don't see it the way you do my my
[59:41] son loves to cook he actually was a
[59:43] sushia for a while I hate it I
[59:46] I some of the traits that he's had the

[1:00:18] body amen what if what if nobody liked

[1:00:28] nobody could cook I would be in trouble
[1:00:31] Saints
[1:00:34] amen you understand uh it it's like
[1:00:37] let's go over to First Corinthians let's
[1:00:39] read this before I get any
[1:00:43] further and I'm going to 1 Corinthians
[1:00:46] 12 where it talks about the gifts of the
[1:00:49] Spirit but I don't want to Major on the
[1:00:53] gifts
[1:00:54] necessarily I want major own Giver right
[1:00:57] amen but in in saying that to help us
[1:01:02] understand by what Paul is telling the
[1:01:05] Corinthians amen now he told him he said
[1:01:07] I fed you with milk and not me we
[1:01:10] understand that but you know sometimes a
[1:01:12] good State needs a good glass of milk to
[1:01:15] wash it down amen I agree with that
[1:01:19] anyway sometimes some places they they
[1:01:22] get so it seems like so revelated in the
[1:01:24] word that it chokes people people out
[1:01:26] right you're like you know what uh tell
[1:01:29] me I need to love my brother at least
[1:01:31] every once in a while well that's just
[1:01:34] simple we should know that well yeah we
[1:01:36] should but Peter said I'd like to bring
[1:01:38] things up to bring it back to your
[1:01:40] remembrance so that you remember that
[1:01:42] hey you you you you might be all highly
[1:01:45] Mighty revelated but you still need to
[1:01:47] love your brother and that comes down to
[1:01:50] the very cruxs and the Simplicity of
[1:01:53] what the gospel is and who Jesus Christ
[1:01:56] is that's why he laid down his life
[1:01:58] that's why there was a Calvary because
[1:02:01] he had love for the Brethren amen amen 1
[1:02:06] Corinthians 12:12 for as the body is one
[1:02:10] one body amen at many members and all
[1:02:13] the members of that one body being many
[1:02:15] are one body so also is Christ and we
[1:02:18] are that mystical body of Jesus Christ

[1:02:32] body and the truson Tabernacle body and
[1:02:36] the open door Tabernacle body and the
[1:02:39] Shalom Tabernacle body and all the other

[1:02:45] four there's then there's a dozen bodies
[1:02:48] in Tucson alone no one body amen amen
[1:02:53] there's a reason why God has
[1:02:56] you here reason why he has me here
[1:02:59] reason why he has them there or them
[1:03:00] over there
[1:03:02] amen by one Spirit we're all baptized
[1:03:06] into that one body whether it be jew or
[1:03:08] Gentile whether it be Bond or free and
[1:03:10] and have all been made to drink into one
[1:03:13] spirit for the body is not one member
[1:03:16] but many so this one body has many
[1:03:20] members praise the lord we did not come
[1:03:22] off an assembly line we weren't all to
[1:03:25] be looking alike or sounding alike or
[1:03:28] acting alike or having every what if
[1:03:30] everybody was a was a
[1:03:34] pastor that'd be nobody out there right
[1:03:39] amen what what if everyone was something
[1:03:42] other than a pastor what if there what
[1:03:44] if there W no ministers then there would
[1:03:46] be nobody
[1:03:47] here amen let's go on for the body is
[1:03:52] not one member but many if the foot
[1:03:54] shall say because I am not a hand I am
[1:03:57] not of the body is it therefore not of
[1:03:59] the body of course it is and the ear
[1:04:02] shall say because I am not an eye I am
[1:04:04] not of the body is it therefore not of
[1:04:06] the body if the whole body were an eye
[1:04:09] where were the
[1:04:10] hearing if the whole body if the ears
[1:04:13] aren't a part of the body then we can't
[1:04:15] hear anything if the ears are not if the
[1:04:17] eyes are not a part of the body then you
[1:04:19] can't see if the feet are not a part of
[1:04:21] the body you can't walk the hands not a
[1:04:23] part of the body you can't grab things
[1:04:25] if
[1:04:26] amen but it takes a hand it takes a foot
[1:04:31] it takes the fingers it takes the ears
[1:04:33] takes the eyes takes the nose takes the
[1:04:35] head takes the legs the head is the
[1:04:38] intelligence the mouth is what speaks
[1:04:41] but what would the mind be without the
[1:04:43] mouth you could think the most brilliant
[1:04:46] things in the world but unless you could
[1:04:48] speak them what good is it going to do
[1:04:50] or at least write them down if it was
[1:04:53] all a brain If it just one big brain
[1:04:56] you could come up you could have the uh
[1:04:59] the absolute omnipotent mind of God and
[1:05:02] what good would it do right amen you
[1:05:05] couldn't speak it you couldn't write
[1:05:07] anything down you couldn't Express
[1:05:09] Yourself of those
[1:05:11] tremendously uh Eternal thoughts without
[1:05:14] having some way to express it amen
[1:05:18] that's why God put his life in us so
[1:05:21] that he in his eternal godness he's in
[1:05:24] his all all Mighty
[1:05:26] omnipotence has vessels that he can use
[1:05:30] to express himself to and through that's
[1:05:34] Us Praise the Lord hallelujah God is not
[1:05:39] just the
[1:05:41] father
[1:05:43] amen he's not just a son he's not just
[1:05:47] the Loos the Holy Spirit he's all those
[1:05:51] things God's Not Just A Healer
[1:05:55] amen I love his healing and his healing
[1:05:58] is awesome and Powerful but he's not
[1:06:00] just a Healer
[1:06:02] amen you understand amen so what about
[1:06:06] the equating of that to us as
[1:06:08] individuals as you as as each one of us
[1:06:12] as all of the body of Christ not just in
[1:06:14] this church but all around the world
[1:06:16] we're all a part of that mystical body
[1:06:18] of Jesus Christ we're all different
[1:06:20] speak different languages
[1:06:22] amen look now
[1:06:28] 18th verse but now have God set the
[1:06:31] members every one of them in the body is
[1:06:34] that has pleased
[1:06:36] him and if they were all one member
[1:06:39] where were the body uh if if if we if we
[1:06:44] were I don't like calling people's names
[1:06:47] but if we're if we were all uh a a big
[1:06:51] dang minister in this message who would
[1:06:54] preach to little groups like us
[1:06:59] amen if if everybody were like a so and
[1:07:02] so then how would the other people get
[1:07:05] riched amen I've gone and listen to
[1:07:09] ministers and come out completely and
[1:07:11] totally and utterly
[1:07:14] confused
[1:07:15] admittedly others in there seem to know
[1:07:18] exactly what the brother was talking
[1:07:21] about I said well that's wonderful he
[1:07:25] and his way of speaking however he can
[1:07:28] get to a certain group of
[1:07:30] people amen I believe I remember one
[1:07:33] time talking to brother Mark stor
[1:07:35] everybody anybody I can remember the
[1:07:37] name of his book astonished that his
[1:07:38] doctor you ever read astonished that his
[1:07:40] doctor brother Mark strok wrote
[1:07:42] astonished at his
[1:07:44] doctr I can't get through the first
[1:07:46] chapter I couldn't get through the first
[1:07:49] page hardly I mean there is some really
[1:07:52] he there's some very there's words in
[1:07:55] there I don't even know what it means
[1:07:57] can't pronounce them I mean brother
[1:07:59] Mark's a very intelligent man and he can
[1:08:02] talk like that he can write like that
[1:08:05] and that's wonderful thank God there's
[1:08:06] somebody can do that but he wrote that
[1:08:08] book for that purpose but that book
[1:08:10] wasn't written to reach me cuz that
[1:08:13] book's going to do nothing for me
[1:08:15] because I don't understand it but it can
[1:08:18] reach others that are in the same kind
[1:08:20] of mental uh intelligence as brother
[1:08:23] Mark and that'll reach those people and
[1:08:26] that's why he wrote it he wrote it in
[1:08:29] that way to reach those people amen when
[1:08:32] the Lord had me write the book I did I
[1:08:34] didn't make it a message book I didn't
[1:08:36] feel I didn't feel God wanted me to
[1:08:38] write it as a message book you'll look
[1:08:40] or if you've read my book you'll notice
[1:08:42] in there I don't mention brother bam but
[1:08:44] I think once maybe twice in the whole
[1:08:47] book it wasn't wrote to be that way it
[1:08:49] was wrote I felt under the inspiration
[1:08:52] of God to write it to reach Christians
[1:08:56] amen as a Bible believer as a
[1:09:00] bible-based book amen now will it reach
[1:09:03] a common person I don't know because
[1:09:06] there's a lot of scripture in that book
[1:09:08] and if you don't know the Scripture it
[1:09:10] would probably be confusing to you
[1:09:12] unless a person goes and searches all
[1:09:14] that scripture out but I wrote it based
[1:09:17] on what the Lord showed me to try to
[1:09:19] reach Christians people who know the
[1:09:22] Bible believe the Bible uh and have that
[1:09:26] type of mental acuity and that spiritual
[1:09:28] Acuity amen see it's it's meant to reach
[1:09:31] that group that book brother Markman was
[1:09:34] meant to reach that group amen it won't
[1:09:37] reach me that brother who preached and I
[1:09:39] was utterly confused did not touch me it
[1:09:42] did not reach me but it reached
[1:09:44] apparently a lot of other people there
[1:09:46] and that's great that that's wonderful
[1:09:49] it should be that way that doesn't mean
[1:09:51] that brother was wrong just because I
[1:09:53] didn't understand him it it just meant
[1:09:56] that God had him in a certain way to
[1:09:57] speak to a certain person or certain
[1:10:00] people and that's why they're here and
[1:10:02] that's why they do what they
[1:10:03] do and that's why God's made me who I've
[1:10:06] made who who he's made me I've had a lot
[1:10:09] of people tell me that brother you you
[1:10:11] just make things so plain I said I don't
[1:10:13] I no I
[1:10:16] don't I I don't do that it may come out
[1:10:20] that way but I don't purposely do that
[1:10:22] that's I guess I'm just a simpleton I
[1:10:24] guess you know way I can explain it is
[1:10:26] in simple terms that's all I know I
[1:10:29] don't have the great swelling
[1:10:30] intelligence of like brother Mark and
[1:10:32] brother Dale and them that can do this I
[1:10:34] can't speak like that so it it it may
[1:10:37] sound plain or real but that's not me
[1:10:40] that's God it's just that that that's
[1:10:43] the gift of each one to do it that way
[1:10:46] amen and each one is to reach each
[1:10:48] people to reach a certain group or to
[1:10:50] read certain people
[1:10:52] because I I've had I've heard and had
[1:10:54] people say say you know everybody in
[1:10:57] Tucson there should just be one message
[1:10:59] church in Tucson everybody should go to
[1:11:00] that one church I don't agree with that
[1:11:03] as as unified as we should be right and
[1:11:07] we should be regardless of what church
[1:11:09] we go to what pastor we are or what or
[1:11:11] or or the pastors themselves and that's
[1:11:13] probably been one of the biggest
[1:11:14] problems Tucson's ever had is because
[1:11:16] the ministry itself is not one right the
[1:11:19] ministry itself doesn't get together at
[1:11:22] all in agreement in anything and and
[1:11:25] together and you you I've tried to do it
[1:11:28] and i' and talked to different brothers
[1:11:31] and things and it it's a uh it's been a
[1:11:36] insurmountable heal at this point uh I
[1:11:40] hate to think of it this way but I kind
[1:11:41] of gave up because it was just that hard
[1:11:45] uh that difficult to break loose but
[1:11:48] unfortunately and everybody's busy and
[1:11:51] all the things is it just is the way it
[1:11:53] is but we should all still be a part of
[1:11:56] the same body even though we don't go to
[1:11:57] the same church right amen amen I had
[1:12:01] people telling me said why after I
[1:12:03] started the church over in cero and tab
[1:12:06] was one to brother Mark stro Corps they
[1:12:08] like why does your daughter go to Marx I
[1:12:10] said because that's where she feels led
[1:12:11] to go and you're okay with that's said
[1:12:13] absolutely she's in church she's taking
[1:12:16] her son to church she's where the Lord
[1:12:19] has sent her amen that's all that
[1:12:23] mattered to me amen well you that that's
[1:12:25] awful big I said no it's not it it it's
[1:12:28] just that's just the way it
[1:12:31] is doesn't matter as long as their word
[1:12:35] God tells them to be that's what matters
[1:12:38] amen that's all that matters to me and
[1:12:41] and that's all that matters to me in my
[1:12:43] life and I trust that's all that matters
[1:12:45] to you in your life and it's all that
[1:12:47] way for a reason but if we have one big
[1:12:50] church you gotta you've got a pastor you
[1:12:54] know there's
[1:12:55] that that that brother with that gift is
[1:12:58] to reach this group but there's another
[1:13:02] brother why do you think God separated
[1:13:04] Paul and S or Paul and uh um
[1:13:09] Barnabas he separated them so they could
[1:13:11] go their separate ways so one could
[1:13:13] reach this and the other could reach
[1:13:15] this plus they reached more people as
[1:13:18] they were a separate group than they
[1:13:19] were the two of them together the two of
[1:13:22] them together they could only go to One
[1:13:24] location the two of them separate could
[1:13:26] go to two
[1:13:27] locations and Barnabas reached people
[1:13:29] I'm sure Paul didn't reach and vice
[1:13:31] versa for a reason it's not supposed to
[1:13:35] like we have one church in Tucson that
[1:13:37] would be great but you know where we're
[1:13:39] going to have one grand Church reunion
[1:13:42] is on the other side and that's what
[1:13:44] matters amen it doesn't matter that
[1:13:46] we're all in one big building here in
[1:13:48] Tucson or we have one Pastor there's a
[1:13:51] reason it's that way amen now is some
[1:13:55] maybe not of God maybe but that's not me
[1:13:58] to call right if they're there doing
[1:14:01] what they're doing and that's not the
[1:14:02] will of the Lord that's not my business
[1:14:04] that's God's business my business is
[1:14:06] that is still my brother yeah that is
[1:14:09] still my sister they are still a part of
[1:14:12] the same body as far as I'm concerned as
[1:14:15] I am that's the body of Jesus Christ
[1:14:18] that's the way I think God sees it and
[1:14:19] that's the way it should be amen maybe
[1:14:23] there's there should be hearing there
[1:14:24] should be be smelling there should be
[1:14:26] thinking there should be walking there
[1:14:27] should be grabbing there should be
[1:14:28] talking there should be seeing there
[1:14:30] should be all a part of the body of
[1:14:32] Christ is coming together to make up
[1:14:34] that one beautiful body of Jesus Christ
[1:14:37] that's the way we should that's the way
[1:14:39] it should be in in in all of our ways of
[1:14:43] doing what we do and how we do it a lot
[1:14:46] of people disagree with brother green
[1:14:48] and and some things brother green did I
[1:14:51] disagree with but that I I love that man
[1:14:54] much as anybody amen and I believe he
[1:14:58] fulfilled the purpose God gave him to
[1:15:01] fulfill and what he did and how he did
[1:15:03] it I personally think when a pastor a
[1:15:07] person's called to be a pastor they have
[1:15:08] a home church that's where they should
[1:15:10] be I don't think a pastor should be
[1:15:12] traveling all over the country I think
[1:15:14] brother green had a specific certain
[1:15:16] call to do what he did and he had a home
[1:15:19] Church to come to that help support him
[1:15:21] and bring him to the place that he could
[1:15:23] do that amen that's my opinion okay that
[1:15:27] and $10 give you a cup of coffee and
[1:15:29] Starbucks that doesn't mean much but
[1:15:32] that's my opinion it's Val me mean
[1:15:35] something to me but that's why God did
[1:15:37] what he did but I to
[1:15:40] me a a a pastor shouldn't be going
[1:15:43] preaching all churches all across the
[1:15:45] country and be gone two or three months
[1:15:47] at a time and having vised ministers
[1:15:49] just coming in revolving door in their
[1:15:51] church not normally but that's my
[1:15:54] opinion but now do I say that that
[1:15:56] brother that's up to him that's again
[1:15:58] that's between him and God right if he
[1:16:00] thinks it's okay to be his home Church
[1:16:02] two months out of a year then uh do
[1:16:06] whatever you feel God's telling you to
[1:16:07] do right I don't see that in the
[1:16:09] scripture but whatever you feel to do is
[1:16:11] up to you amen I I don't say that
[1:16:14] brother's not my brother I I just
[1:16:17] disagree with that amen amen I believe
[1:16:20] God made the fivefold ministry is for a
[1:16:22] purpose yes amen and he set some pastors
[1:16:25] evangelists missionaries teachers
[1:16:26] prophets he set them all in there for a
[1:16:28] reason to do a specific thing Amen to
[1:16:32] fulfill a specific office praise the
[1:16:34] Lord the Evangelist is an evangelist let
[1:16:37] him go evangelize let him go and hit
[1:16:39] those churches where a pastor should be
[1:16:41] pastoring his
[1:16:43] church what kind of a flock is it going
[1:16:45] to be if the pastor pastors his flock
[1:16:48] for a little while and then he says okay
[1:16:49] you guys will be all right I'll I'll
[1:16:51] just send a hirling in here to come and
[1:16:52] take care of you for a while I'm going
[1:16:53] to be gone
[1:16:56] you think anyway that that's just my
[1:16:59] opinion probably getting a little too
[1:17:01] detailed but that's my opinion God put
[1:17:04] that missionary to do what he does that
[1:17:06] evangelist to do what he does the pastor
[1:17:08] to do what he does the teacher to do
[1:17:10] what he there it's all a part of the
[1:17:12] Great mystical body right amen that the
[1:17:14] that the whole body come into a place of
[1:17:18] perfection or maturity amen as members
[1:17:22] as as part of the body of Christ
[1:17:26] amen but now are they 21st are many
[1:17:29] members yet but one body and the ey
[1:17:31] cannot say unto the hand I have no need
[1:17:33] of thee nor again the head to the feet I
[1:17:36] have no need of you nay much more those
[1:17:38] members of the body which seem to be
[1:17:40] more feeble are they seem to be more
[1:17:42] feeble but they are necessary but it
[1:17:45] seems like everybody wants to be the one
[1:17:48] that speaks in tongues everybody wants
[1:17:51] to be the one that gives that great
[1:17:53] prophecy or everybody wants to be that
[1:17:56] one that's on the camera and preaches
[1:17:58] and behind a pull pit but that's not the
[1:18:01] way God set the body up right amen amen
[1:18:06] but the ones that sit on the back pew
[1:18:09] that attend faithfully and pay their
[1:18:11] ties faithfully and are faithful to the
[1:18:13] post of Duty and those that have this
[1:18:16] just the simplest of gifts are just as
[1:18:20] important as the one that pastors of
[1:18:25] 20,000 never
[1:18:27] Church he's just as important in the
[1:18:31] body of Christ he is just as important
[1:18:35] amen unfortunately we as humans we have
[1:18:38] respect for a person God doesn't as we
[1:18:41] have respect for a person unfortunately
[1:18:43] in our carnality we look at it and see
[1:18:46] that person is more important amen I've
[1:18:49] had ministers and there were there was
[1:18:51] times in my young life of ministering
[1:18:53] that I wanted to to be like a certain
[1:18:55] Minister CU he was so popular and and
[1:18:59] big church and all this stuff and God
[1:19:01] told me one time I didn't call you to be
[1:19:03] that person I called that person to be
[1:19:05] that person I called this one to be that
[1:19:08] person I didn't call you to be like them
[1:19:10] I've had other ministers tell me I P
[1:19:13] literally I patterned my Ministry after
[1:19:16] so and so I said why would you do that
[1:19:19] yeah if God's give you your own Ministry
[1:19:22] why would you want to be in pattered
[1:19:24] yourself after some other minister right
[1:19:27] I wouldn't even want to pattern myself
[1:19:29] after brother Brandon as far as that
[1:19:31] goes right amen amen I want to be what
[1:19:35] God called me to be yes I want to be
[1:19:38] where God called me to go I want to be
[1:19:41] do what God has called me in life to do
[1:19:45] amen because that is just as important
[1:19:49] again as a person who may have 10 20 30
[1:19:51] 40,000 members in his church or or or or
[1:19:55] have a great uh a gift of some kind
[1:19:58] people call it great gifts those that
[1:20:00] are out forward gifts the gifts we get
[1:20:03] down here in the last verses of of this
[1:20:06] um uh the gifts of uh the gifts of
[1:20:09] healing the the uh the the uh Gifts of
[1:20:14] Miracles the gift of heals the gift of
[1:20:16] governments the gift nobody sees those
[1:20:20] things th those are things that are done
[1:20:23] outside of the Limelight
[1:20:25] the gift of helps for example I had a
[1:20:28] brother one time he asked me he says I
[1:20:31] don't even I a been in the message been
[1:20:34] serving the lord for 40 years I I I
[1:20:37] don't think the Lord's giv me gift I I
[1:20:39] don't know that I have any kind of a
[1:20:41] gift I said are you kidding me to me and
[1:20:45] knowing him as as intimately as I have
[1:20:47] over so many years I'm like you
[1:20:50] absolutely have a gift a glaring gift
[1:20:53] that is absolutely identified in the
[1:20:56] scripture yeah anybody come in he take
[1:21:00] them out to L see if they had a place to
[1:21:03] stay drive them where they need to go be
[1:21:06] there for that person whatever they
[1:21:08] needed or wanted to do and he come to me
[1:21:11] and says y' don't think I have a gift I
[1:21:14] said are you kidding me and I think a
[1:21:16] lot of people are probably like that
[1:21:18] they just live their lives and they just
[1:21:19] do what's on their heart to do and don't
[1:21:21] realize that's a gift of the spirit that
[1:21:23] God's given them to be that way and to
[1:21:26] do those things and to act like that
[1:21:28] they don't even realize it they're just
[1:21:29] living their life but they're living
[1:21:31] their life based on what God gave him to
[1:21:33] do amen I said brother right here look 1
[1:21:38] Corinthians chapter 12 verse 28 says
[1:21:42] that they have the gifts of healings
[1:21:46] heths and governments I said if you
[1:21:48] don't have a gift of helps I don't think
[1:21:50] it ever
[1:21:52] existed amen cuz that's all the brother
[1:21:55] ever did for other people was help and
[1:21:58] be there pay for a meal or something or
[1:22:00] whatever amen but it's it's it's not out
[1:22:04] front it's not it's it's not in the
[1:22:06] Limelight it's it's something that
[1:22:08] happens that nobody ever sees hardly
[1:22:11] nobody ever knows about I might not
[1:22:12] myself if I didn't know the person very
[1:22:15] very well I wouldn't have know but it's
[1:22:18] just goes to show God has each of us
[1:22:20] doing what we do there's for a reason
[1:22:23] amen uh brother grantom even talked
[1:22:26] about those that are coming around and
[1:22:28] uh the gifts of the Spirit the Lord was
[1:22:31] using with the gift in the hand and the
[1:22:33] discernment and all and he said you know
[1:22:36] you the Lord does something and next
[1:22:38] thing you know you got a 100
[1:22:39] impersonators they all got a gift in the
[1:22:41] hand now something's happening they're
[1:22:43] vibrating or bumps or whatever
[1:22:45] something's going on or you the the the
[1:22:48] gift of discernment all of a sudden you
[1:22:49] got another 100 ministers around the
[1:22:51] country and they got this great gift
[1:22:53] they can see things and and they can say
[1:22:56] this person and you know your name is

[1:23:09] you live in the United States yeah born
[1:23:11] here lived here my whole life that's not
[1:23:13] very uh
[1:23:15] enlightening but uh but there all has to
[1:23:18] come these caral impersonations and
[1:23:20] that's what brother R called them just
[1:23:21] caral impersonations they all wanted to
[1:23:24] do this or be this person or have this
[1:23:26] kind of a gift or something and and it
[1:23:29] can be impersonated absolutely any of
[1:23:32] those brother mam said any gift of God
[1:23:35] Satan can impersonate yes he just cannot
[1:23:38] bring this word word by word amen he
[1:23:43] cannot get the Holy Ghost if he did that
[1:23:45] he would come through the blood of Jesus
[1:23:47] Christ he came through the blood of
[1:23:48] Jesus Christ he'd be your brother not
[1:23:50] your adversary yes
[1:23:53] amen he cannot create he cannot bring
[1:23:56] this word impersonate gifts oh

[1:24:06] write unknown tongues nothing about God
[1:24:10] at all satanic to the core satanic amen
[1:24:14] but it's an
[1:24:15] impersonation that's what we have a lot
[1:24:17] of caral
[1:24:19] impersonations but friend we need each
[1:24:22] other amen my son likes to cook and I

[1:24:31] likes to cook and I like to eat so great
[1:24:35] amen it works for
[1:24:37] me so anyway let's finish
[1:24:40] this those members of the
[1:24:43] body look now always get put out those
[1:24:47] members of the body which we think to be
[1:24:49] less honorable upon these we bestow more
[1:24:52] abundant honor and our uncommonly parts
[1:24:55] have more abundant cess for our calmly
[1:24:58] Parts have no need but God have tempered
[1:25:01] praise the Lord God has tempered God has
[1:25:04] fused the body together yes having given
[1:25:07] more abundant honor to that part which
[1:25:11] life praise the
[1:25:13] Lord that there should be no Schism no
[1:25:17] division no wedge driven in the body of
[1:25:20] Christ that uh but that the members
[1:25:23] should have the same care one for
[1:25:26] another yes
[1:25:29] amen and whether one member suffer all
[1:25:31] the members suffer with it or one member
[1:25:34] be honored all the members Rejoice with
[1:25:36] it now ye are the body of Christ and
[1:25:39] members in particular and God has set
[1:25:41] some in the church first apostles second
[1:25:43] early prophets early teachers after that
[1:25:46] Miracles Gifts of healings heals
[1:25:49] governments diversity of tongues are all

[1:26:00] Miracles no we are not amen but those
[1:26:05] gifts are there are given in the body
[1:26:07] for a reason not to everybody but for
[1:26:09] particular reason for particular people
[1:26:12] now every one of us is called to pray
[1:26:15] every one of us is called to pray for
[1:26:17] the sake any one of us could come and
[1:26:19] lay hands and pray over a person it's
[1:26:22] not talking about that that's part the
[1:26:24] body of Christ but a but a gift in
[1:26:27] particular amen of of this these gifts
[1:26:32] have all the gifts of healing no do all
[1:26:35] speak with tongues no do all in like
[1:26:39] what some people will tell you not all
[1:26:41] people do speak in tongues not all
[1:26:43] people
[1:26:44] interpret
[1:26:46] amen cover earnestly the best gifts and
[1:26:49] yet show I unto you a more excellent way
[1:26:53] that's brother br says a couple thingsam
[1:26:56] said
[1:26:57] here look return in Jubilee 1962 he said
[1:27:01] what a wonderful picture it gets us
[1:27:03] because it's a type of God's placing in
[1:27:05] the church himself every member every
[1:27:09] stone every place every Christian to
[1:27:13] itself praise God you know what that
[1:27:15] includes
[1:27:16] me amen that includes the janitor that
[1:27:20] includes the person that sits in the
[1:27:21] back that includ amen that includes
[1:27:25] everyone to hit to itself each one of us
[1:27:29] in our particular way peculiar way has a
[1:27:33] place in the house of God peculiar way
[1:27:38] that mean well who are we peculiar to
[1:27:39] we're not peculiar to God because he's
[1:27:41] the one that made us who are we peculiar
[1:27:43] to other people each other even if you
[1:27:48] will every peculiar way has a place in
[1:27:51] the house of God like Solomon's Temple
[1:27:54] when it was cut out all over the world
[1:27:56] but when it was brought into japa
[1:27:58] floated in to doog cart these old rocks
[1:28:01] had their place when the temple went
[1:28:03] together and I think that God like a
[1:28:06] jigsaw B amen every piece is cut for its
[1:28:10] purpose you can't take the one piece and
[1:28:13] put it in the corner if it belongs in
[1:28:14] the middle it doesn't fit amen now
[1:28:19] sometimes people try to make themselves
[1:28:21] a corner piece when they're a center
[1:28:23] piece or vice versa
[1:28:24] but it doesn't fit yes amen and that and
[1:28:28] that does eventually come to fruition
[1:28:31] and I think that God down through this
[1:28:33] time has cut out some very odd
[1:28:37] Stones
[1:28:38] amen uh y'all looking at one very odd
[1:28:43] Stone I'm looking at some odd Stones too
[1:28:46] amen that we might have uh that we might
[1:28:49] not have
[1:28:51] understood but they have their place in
[1:28:54] exactly in the temple in the building of
[1:28:57] God and isn't that what
[1:29:00] matters is it that the thing that's the
[1:29:03] most important we all have that place in
[1:29:07] the
[1:29:08] body all fitly joined together in the
[1:29:12] body of
[1:29:13] Christ thirsting for Life 1960 now I
[1:29:17] obeyed him I obeyed him in my peculiar
[1:29:21] way and you obeyed him in your your way
[1:29:25] he gives us both the Holy Ghost so we
[1:29:28] ought to be Christian Brethren and
[1:29:29] sister enough to arm up together and
[1:29:33] March on for one great purpose and
[1:29:35] that's the gospel amen amen together
[1:29:39] that God made us called us to be one
[1:29:43] amen remember remember how uh brother
[1:29:47] gream told
[1:29:49] us when he was uh going through the
[1:29:51] church age book and they were they were
[1:29:53] uh
[1:29:55] uh brother brother green was reading the
[1:29:57] church age book brother Brown they were
[1:29:58] going up the road uh British Columbia or
[1:30:01] up up that way I believe it was and they
[1:30:05] were riding together brother Rand was
[1:30:07] driving brother Rand brother green had
[1:30:08] the church age book they were proof
[1:30:10] reading it and he was reading the church
[1:30:11] H book to brother brandham and he got to
[1:30:14] that place in the in the church H book
[1:30:16] where it expressed brother bram's
[1:30:18] experience when he received the Holy
[1:30:20] Ghost and brother gram said and brother
[1:30:22] green was reading and said it was like a
[1:30:24] rain pelting experience youall know what
[1:30:26] I'm sure you know what I'm talking about
[1:30:27] brother green said many times it's like
[1:30:29] a rain pelting experience brother said
[1:30:32] wait a minute wait read that again
[1:30:33] brother per he said when you got the
[1:30:35] Holy Ghost brother random that it felt
[1:30:37] like a rain melting experience he said
[1:30:39] no no he said take that out he said why
[1:30:42] brother random said people are going to
[1:30:44] want to know what happened to you and
[1:30:46] how you felt and how it happened to you
[1:30:47] and that kind of thing because we all
[1:30:49] have our own testimony he said no if you
[1:30:50] put that in there all the Believers that
[1:30:53] trust in me going to think that they
[1:30:55] have to have a rain pelting experience
[1:30:58] before they have to get the Holy Ghost
[1:31:00] he said and that was the way I got it
[1:31:03] not everybody gets it like that in fact
[1:31:06] he may have been the only human ever
[1:31:08] walked this rock that ever got it that
[1:31:10] way amen and the way I got it may have
[1:31:13] been the one person ever got it the way
[1:31:16] I got it and you the same but brother
[1:31:19] Ram wanted to make sure if they trusted
[1:31:21] in brother Ram enough and and and held
[1:31:24] him in such confidence that if he said
[1:31:27] that he got a rain peling experience
[1:31:29] that everybody else before they believed
[1:31:33] that they had the holy ghost that they
[1:31:35] would have to have a rain peling
[1:31:38] experience he said take it out that
[1:31:40] makes sense amen because brother bram's
[1:31:43] different brother bram's we're all
[1:31:46] different but his experience our
[1:31:48] experiences I didn't have a r healthy
[1:31:50] experience amen I was more of a sunshine
[1:31:53] experience if you
[1:31:55] will but everybody's different it's up
[1:31:57] to each individual but you understand
[1:31:59] why brother random had brother green
[1:32:01] take that out of the book because
[1:32:03] everybody would think they have to have
[1:32:05] the exact same thing to before they
[1:32:08] believe that they had the Holy Ghost
[1:32:10] amen and it's not that way for everybody
[1:32:13] look here I'll close just a
[1:32:16] minute it is it is I Be not Afraid 1962
[1:32:20] he said but one Spirit by one Spirit

[1:32:25] and the way that we can set here tonight

[1:32:35] blue what if it was all yellow amen just
[1:32:39] be a big yellow thing up there it still
[1:32:41] be pretty because God doesn't make
[1:32:43] anything that's not but it's what the
[1:32:45] beauty of it is is the colors of it amen
[1:32:48] the meshing of the colors together the
[1:32:50] way God made it amen set of rainbows a
[1:32:54] covenant God's a god of variety don't

[1:36:43] happened with Joel and being prayed for
[1:36:46] and how much better my knees were they
[1:36:49] still a little sore sore and stiff
[1:36:52] during the week but I never took a
[1:36:53] single paint and never had to take a
[1:36:55] single paint pill first time in well I
[1:36:58] can't remember two or three months
[1:36:59] whatever it's been not never had to take
[1:37:01] a single pain pill all week by the grace
[1:37:03] of God and we get to lunch one day you
[1:37:07] know and I was limping a little bit it's
[1:37:09] hard I mean when you're standing on your
[1:37:10] feet on concrete 12 hours plus a day no
[1:37:15] it get to anybody but uh he said he told
[1:37:20] the kogan the Brian he was telling him
[1:37:22] he said well well do you think Newton
[1:37:24] could tell a lie you think that he
[1:37:27] really would he really tell us a lie and
[1:37:30] Brian just looked at him and said newon
[1:37:32] only tells the truth that God gives him
[1:37:34] to
[1:37:35] tell I said really I couldn't believe he
[1:37:40] said that but that's just what he said
[1:37:44] he said you only tell the truth of God's
[1:37:47] truth or something to that effect us wow
[1:37:51] um he's got more confidence to me than I
[1:37:54] do cuz I know that's not true there's
[1:37:57] times that I've done things that is
[1:37:59] absolutely wrong amen I try not to but
[1:38:02] we're all human anyway I thought that
[1:38:04] was just unusual but that but
[1:38:08] um it good thing about it is we all kind
[1:38:11] of like the same places but uh but just
[1:38:15] the group in itself is so different amen
[1:38:20] but the good part about it and I think a
[1:38:23] reason that we do good is because it's
[1:38:26] some people like doing certain things
[1:38:27] more than others and some people are
[1:38:29] better at other things than other and
[1:38:31] there's so much to be done that this
[1:38:33] person does that well and enjoys it some
[1:38:35] person does that well and enjoys it and
[1:38:37] some person does that well and enjoys it
[1:38:39] and that's what makes a team the team is
[1:38:42] one there's many members there's several
[1:38:44] of us but there's one team and this
[1:38:47] person does that and this and this and
[1:38:49] and they're good at it and they like
[1:38:50] doing it but it's one team
[1:38:54] and we and we come together as one team
[1:38:56] praise the
[1:38:57] Lord and and and it works because that's
[1:39:02] that's what's in each of us to do it's
[1:39:05] all a part of that same it's just God's
[1:39:07] it's just God's variety amen we're all a
[1:39:11] part of God's variety that God has made
[1:39:13] us that way don't ever discount I I've
[1:39:16] SE things I that you know I I'll hold my
[1:39:20] opinion A lot of times to myself that I
[1:39:22] think you know that's just not right
[1:39:23] right and some things is probably not
[1:39:25] even scriptural or some things that I've
[1:39:28] heard preach that I'm like I've never
[1:39:30] found that in the Bible I've never heard
[1:39:33] brother brand say that uh but I try to
[1:39:36] give the benefit of the doubt but I do
[1:39:39] know that that's probably not unless
[1:39:42] something else happens or God shows me
[1:39:44] not somebody I'm going to go here preach
[1:39:46] again if I don't think they're preaching
[1:39:48] the scripture the message of scripture I
[1:39:51] I I'm just not going to go hear that
[1:39:54] person uh I've been to a I've been to a
[1:39:57] service where the minister was very
[1:39:59] insulting to a certain group that was
[1:40:01] there and I thought very condescending
[1:40:04] and and uh I I thought you know um I
[1:40:09] I'll probably never hear that person
[1:40:11] preach again because I just that's just
[1:40:14] not something now other people may like
[1:40:16] that there's a lot of laughing going on
[1:40:18] and and enjoying and that's up to them
[1:40:21] that's not something I enjoy right and I
[1:40:24] I don't I don't want to be a part of
[1:40:25] that but that's just me now do I think
[1:40:28] that person's going to hell no I'm not I
[1:40:31] wouldn't ever dare go there that's
[1:40:33] between them and God again that's
[1:40:35] between them and God praise the Lord but
[1:40:38] I know that is the as the bouquet of God
[1:40:42] the variety that God has made we're all
[1:40:45] part of the same mystical body of Jesus
[1:40:47] Christ we're all just trying to live our
[1:40:50] the best life we can for God trying to
[1:40:53] do the best that we can uh sometimes as
[1:40:56] a pastor and a pastor's wife and people
[1:40:59] that we've had through the years we
[1:41:01] think
[1:41:02] why did does that person do that it
[1:41:07] never comes out right and they still do
[1:41:10] it just it baffles us to no end
[1:41:13] sometimes but that's that's the
[1:41:14] discussion between me and my wife and
[1:41:16] it's things that we leave before the
[1:41:18] Lord but that doesn't but that person is
[1:41:22] still just a part of the body of Christ
[1:41:24] as anybody amen still love him as much
[1:41:27] as anybody uh from Florida and and
[1:41:30] around wherever it's been some things
[1:41:33] you just don't understand but I'm sure
[1:41:35] there's things that I've done that other
[1:41:38] people don't understand that didn't make
[1:41:41] sense to them but we're still just
[1:41:43] trying to live the life that God's
[1:41:45] called to be that witness to be that
[1:41:49] person to be that portion that God wants
[1:41:51] us to be amen in our Oddities brother R
[1:41:55] call us oddballs preach the message
[1:41:58] called the Oddball and that's exactly
[1:42:00] what we're odd not just to the world we
[1:42:02] some of us sometimes we're odd to one
[1:42:04] another amen but we love and expect and
[1:42:09] receive one another as a part of that
[1:42:11] body of Christ that's what makes up the
[1:42:14] whole body praise the Lord there may be
[1:42:17] one person on this planet that I am the
[1:42:20] only human drawing breath that could
[1:42:22] reach that
[1:42:24] person there may be one person on this
[1:42:27] planet that you are the only one drawing
[1:42:30] a breath that can actually be able to
[1:42:31] witness or talk to that person yes Amen
[1:42:34] to get them to see to get them to
[1:42:36] understand to get them to come to Christ
[1:42:39] amen a lot of people want to depend on
[1:42:41] the ministry or look to the pastors I
[1:42:44] have somebody or something if God's put
[1:42:46] that person and and not that the
[1:42:48] minister Pastor shouldn't or wouldn't
[1:42:50] but God sometimes you may be that person
[1:42:54] I may not be the person to reach that
[1:42:56] person God put them in your path and
[1:42:59] that may be the reason that God has them
[1:43:01] for you to talk to to witness to amen
[1:43:04] for you to speak to them for you to help
[1:43:07] them to come to Christ amen I might
[1:43:10] could just be a minister so you can come
[1:43:13] in and and say something that may not be
[1:43:16] uh that's helpful to that person
[1:43:20] amen but there's a reason that's why God
[1:43:23] does it like that amen let's stand if we
[1:43:33] could we all may be different but we're
[1:43:37] all still
[1:43:41] one we all might
[1:43:44] need we all do need one another

[1:47:31] King a good friend of mine uh that was
[1:47:34] in our church in
[1:47:35] Florida uh eats probably faster probably
[1:47:38] because he's in military eats faster
[1:47:40] than probably anybody I ever seen he can
[1:47:42] down a plate of food in a matter of
[1:47:44] minutes and he'll look and say uh we
[1:47:48] were visiting one time at their house
[1:47:49] and uh he was done I bar had mine
[1:47:53] seasoned and he was done and I look I
[1:47:56] said was it good he said yeah it was
[1:47:57] good he said was yours good I said no
[1:48:00] it's still is yours is gone I'm still
[1:48:03] enjoying
[1:48:04] mine guys I work with man they wol down
[1:48:07] their food and I and I'm like I don't I
[1:48:10] don't eat to survive I eat because I
[1:48:13] enjoy food now survival always is hard
[1:48:17] but I eat because I enjoy food people
[1:48:20] like the foods in their mouth for two
[1:48:23] chewes it's gone and I just I just I eat
[1:48:27] slow because I just enjoy if something I
[1:48:29] enjoy I enjoy eating uh but that's just
[1:48:33] I'm just different that way amen but
[1:48:37] again I on the plane yesterday we got a
[1:48:41] bag of of snack this guy next to me he's
