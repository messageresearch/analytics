[43:50] 60 uh let's read the first three verses
[43:53] arise Shine for thy light is come and
[43:58] the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee
[44:01] for Behold The Darkness the the darkness
[44:05] shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness
[44:08] the people but the Lord shall arise upon
[44:12] thee and His glory shall be seen upon
[44:14] thee the Gentiles shall come to thy
[44:17] light and Kings to the brightness of thy
[44:20] Rising amen amen you can be seated if
[44:22] you'd like
[44:25] amen praise the Lord an exclamation that
[44:29] uh um that Isaiah gave us there to
[44:32] understand that of course there'll be a
[44:33] day that there'll be Darkness upon the
[44:36] land there' be gross Darkness to people
[44:38] but the the Gentiles now think of this
[44:41] what Isaiah wrote back then because the
[44:44] Gentiles at this time was not a people
[44:47] amen they were not a godly people they
[44:50] were not a religious people they were
[44:52] not a people that trusted or believed in
[44:54] God they were heathens but yet is Isaiah
[44:57] come out of course through prophetic uh
[45:00] utterance uh saying how that the
[45:02] Gentiles would accept that light the
[45:05] Gentiles would receive that light amen
[45:08] and thank God for that light Lord
[45:10] because without light we'd all still be
[45:12] groping in darkness amen just like the
[45:14] world is groping in darkness just like
[45:16] so many of the people of the world are
[45:18] groping in Gross Darkness today but God
[45:21] has come and arose and shine his light
[45:24] upon our pathway now I want to go over
[45:25] to Ephesians chapter 2 read this verse
[45:29] of
[45:31] scripture uh beginning with verse
[45:34] one Ephesians chapter
[45:38] 2 we'll begin here also with verse
[45:43] one amen Ephesians

[46:06] who were dead in darkness and trespasses
[46:09] and sins wherein in time past time past
[46:13] thank God they past you walked according
[46:15] to the course of this world according to
[46:18] the prince of the power of the air the
[46:20] spirit that now worketh still worketh in
[46:24] the children of Disobedience those that
[46:26] are growing groping yet in Gross
[46:28] Darkness among whom also we all had our
[46:32] conversation in times past in the lust
[46:35] of our flesh fulfilling the desires of
[46:37] the Flesh and of the mind and were by
[46:39] Nature the children of Wrath even as
[46:42] others but God praise the Lord God who
[46:47] is rich in Mercy for his great love
[46:51] wherewith he loved us amen even when we
[46:54] were dead in sins
[46:57] had quickened us together with Christ
[47:00] notice that one time we were dead in
[47:03] sins yes praise the Lord our sins
[47:06] separated us from God remember in the
[47:08] beginning the Garden of Eden God said
[47:10] the day you the day you sin that's the
[47:13] day we separate amen that's the day the
[47:16] day you sin is the day you die that's
[47:18] the day we separate amen and that same
[47:21] sin had kept people amen as we're born
[47:23] in sin shaped iniquity come the world
[47:25] speaking lies kept being separated from
[47:28] God kept men separated from light amen
[47:32] dead in the Sin but thank God because of
[47:36] the liberty of Jesus Christ and the
[47:37] blood he shed and the work he did at
[47:39] Calvary we are not dead in sin anymore
[47:42] but we are dead to sinen sin now has no
[47:46] longer has a Hal on the bride of Christ
[47:49] sin no longer has a halt on the children
[47:52] of Jesus Christ sin no longer has a grip
[47:55] on you because you've been set free and
[47:58] liberated from sin amen you are dead to
[48:01] sin in other words sin is dead to us sin
[48:05] is dead because uh because we no longer
[48:09] sin amen the man who is born of God
[48:12] cannot sin because his God's life
[48:16] remaineth in him in him now that doesn't
[48:18] mean we don't as humans make mistakes
[48:20] absolutely amen but in our hearts
[48:23] there's no more sin praise the Lord sin
[48:25] has been divorced so we're not dead in
[48:28] sin anymore but we're dead to sin sin
[48:30] has no halt over us whatsoever anymore
[48:34] praise God at one time in Satan's pawn
[48:37] shop he had a grip over us he had claims
[48:40] over us that sin that we were bound to
[48:43] God liberated us and set us free by his
[48:46] blood so that now we can be now we can
[48:48] really know the fourth verse we can
[48:51] really know fourth verse in the power of
[48:54] the truth that God is rich in Mercy
[48:58] praise the Lord God is rich in Mercy for
[49:01] his great love amen wherein he loved us

[49:14] Jesus that in the ages to come he might
[49:17] show the exceeding Riches of his grace
[49:20] and kindness toward us through Christ
[49:22] Jesus for by grace are you saved through
[49:25] faith and that not of ourselves of
[49:28] yourselves it is the gift of God not of
[49:32] Works lest any man should boast it's not

[49:42] Us amen we just accepted it we accepted
[49:46] his pardon amen we accepted his way we
[49:50] accepted his blood we accepted the price
[49:52] he paid for us at Calvary and then
[49:54] accepting it re when we accept we

[50:18] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[50:22] good works which God hath before
[50:24] ordained that we should walk walk in
[50:27] them praise the Lord once we were dead
[50:30] in sins God pulled us from the dark
[50:33] chaos of the world and made us to sit
[50:36] together with him in Heavenly places in
[50:39] Christ Jesus friend we didn't deserve
[50:41] that none of what God has done for us
[50:43] we've deserved right what we deserved
[50:46] was hell what we deserved was the cross
[50:48] what we deserved was utter darkness and
[50:51] Chaos we deserve death we deserve
[50:54] separation from God that's what we as as
[50:56] Mortals as humans deserved but by his
[50:59] mercy God great in his Mercy amen shine
[51:03] his path Upon Our light or his light
[51:05] upon our pathway that light has
[51:08] separated us from the darkness the

[51:15] today the darkness the gross darkness
[51:17] that covers over people and covers over
[51:19] their lives God's light has come and
[51:22] shine upon our pathway now everyone
[51:25] everyone has the desire has the ability
[51:28] to be able to come to that not everybody
[51:30] does God's will were that all would come
[51:34] to repentance but not all do
[51:37] unfortunately there's still people now
[51:39] working the children of Disobedience
[51:41] working in that Darkness as we deserve
[51:44] that Darkness amen his Mercy provided a
[51:48] way for us his Mercy paved away that we
[51:51] could walk down the paths of
[51:53] righteousness that he could shine his
[51:55] light upon us and show us his way amen
[51:58] look at this and God who is rich in
[52:01] Mercy January
[52:04] 65 brother ramam said he that is born of
[52:07] God doth not commit sin amen the
[52:11] worshipper once purged has no more
[52:14] conscience of sin no more desire of sin
[52:17] notice from the heart that's the the
[52:19] desire comes amen not fleshly amen but
[52:23] the spirit takes over the
[52:25] flesh amen the the the soul takes over
[52:29] the spirit which takes over the flesh so
[52:31] now the desires that you have are the
[52:33] desires of the Soul if your soul is of
[52:35] God your desire is for God right amen
[52:38] amen praise the Lord there's no more
[52:42] desire to sin the sin question is over
[52:46] you become a part of God in Christ
[52:48] Christ died to redeem you praise the
[52:52] Lord God rich in his Mercy yes gave his
[52:55] life that he might redeem us now just
[52:57] think of that think of what we would
[53:00] have think
[53:01] about just think of all that we would
[53:04] have been if it hadn't been for
[53:06] God but God in his Rich Mercy how he has
[53:11] redeemed us
[53:12] tonight this morning where would we be
[53:16] this morning if it had not been for
[53:19] God's Rich mercy upon us amen oh my
[53:24] think about that Saints how difficult
[53:27] sometimes how challenging it is to think
[53:29] about how sobering it is to think
[53:31] sometimes about where we might be if it
[53:33] had not been for the grace of God you
[53:35] look at people out in the world today
[53:37] and look at the condition of where they
[53:38] are and where what's going on you could
[53:41] think that could just as easily have
[53:42] been me if it had not been for the mercy
[53:44] of God if it had not been for the grace
[53:47] of God the acceptance of that price that
[53:49] he paid for us I would be one of those
[53:51] people I could be one of those that are
[53:53] sitting on the sidewalk today begging I
[53:56] could be be one of those people groping
[53:57] in darkness and rather be at a football
[53:59] game than in church I could be one of
[54:01] those people that would rather be uh
[54:03] doing something other than serving the
[54:05] lord in our lives I could be one of
[54:07] those people puffing on a cigarette or
[54:09] guzz down a whiskey or or gambling my
[54:11] life away I could be one of those people
[54:14] but God rich in his Mercy yes wherewith
[54:17] he loved me shed his blood for me the
[54:21] acceptance of that Christ where could we
[54:22] be today Saints where would we be
[54:25] without him we would be told toally lost
[54:27] we would be those groping in the
[54:29] darkness we would be those covered and
[54:31] and consumed by his gross
[54:34] Darkness God's Rich mercy upon us where
[54:37] would we be right now if it had not been
[54:40] for God's Rich mercy upon us once the
[54:44] world was so sinful that man had caused
[54:47] corruption to come upon the Earth until
[54:48] it grieved God so that he ever made man
[54:53] the whole head uh the whole body was a
[54:55] putri ified sore and God even grieved
[54:58] that he ever made a man so he said I
[55:01] would destroy men whom I have created he
[55:04] will destroy them because he was nothing
[55:07] but just because man was nothing but a
[55:09] bunch of corruption and the whole human
[55:12] race would have been wiped out at that
[55:14] time but God rich in his Mercy would not
[55:17] let the innocent perish with the guilty
[55:20] God and his great wisdom looked down
[55:22] through the animals of time and realized
[55:24] knowing god of course right that there
[55:26] would be those that would accept it
[55:28] there would be those that as he gave the
[55:30] utterance to Isaiah would that would
[55:32] receive it there would be those even to
[55:35] the Gentile at that time was unheard of
[55:37] would even be to the Gentile something
[55:40] that the Gentile would receive and
[55:42] accept and become a part of the light of
[55:45] God as light would shine it and as God
[55:48] saw that he recognized the people no
[55:50] doubt friend I will say he looked down
[55:52] and saw me right he looked down and saw
[55:55] you yes and realize that those people
[55:58] don't deserve to die because of the
[56:00] mistake of some others right I will make
[56:03] a way I will provide a way that they
[56:06] will be able to be redeemed back to me
[56:09] that they will be able to come back to
[56:11] the place that I saw them in my mind
[56:13] before the foundational world and God in
[56:15] his great wisdom chose as he could have
[56:18] wiped them all away would not let the
[56:22] innocent perish with the guilty he went
[56:24] away and made a provided way for the
[56:27] ones that that that wanted to come in
[56:31] Praise the Lord that wanted to come in
[56:34] oh think of it now we're going to get to
[56:36] something here in just a minute it makes
[56:38] it very striking we all know but it's
[56:40] true that wanted to do what was right
[56:43] that wanted to come in he made a way of
[56:46] Mercy for those who would desire Mercy
[56:50] my that's a striking statement when you
[56:51] think about it friend you think about
[56:54] Mercy that's out there and that people
[56:56] that spurn that Mercy yes they literally
[57:00] do not want that Mercy right that's just
[57:03] hard to Fathom today friend if there's
[57:06] any if there's any of the goodness of
[57:08] mercy of God grace of God in any
[57:11] capacity I want it every bit I can get I
[57:16] want as much Mercy from you as I can get
[57:18] much that's just from God Amen we all
[57:22] need that every one of us need that
[57:24] Mercy from God and to think that there's
[57:27] people out there that actually do not
[57:30] want it right they spurn it
[57:33] yes it's it's hard to Fathom that but
[57:36] there are there are people and factly
[57:38] truthfully the majority of people really
[57:40] in the world today they just they don't
[57:41] even want God's mercy it's there full
[57:45] and free for anyone that will partake
[57:47] but they just don't want it my is for
[57:51] those who desired Mercy amen praise the
[57:56] lord well you can't desire Mercy unless
[57:59] you recognize you need
[58:01] Mercy if you don't recognize you need
[58:04] Mercy why do you want Mercy amen and my
[58:08] wife sometimes she'll go to the grocery
[58:10] store and she'll call me she say look in
[58:12] the Frid see if we have any milk you
[58:14] know what if we got a whole gallon of
[58:15] milk between the two of us we probably
[58:17] won't even use it all but if there's a
[58:19] gallon of milk in there I tell her honey
[58:21] we got milk she didn't go buy three or
[58:22] four more gallons of milk we've got milk
[58:25] and people think the same way why would
[58:27] I need to ask for and want Mercy if I
[58:29] don't even know I need mercy and people
[58:31] don't know they don't know that they
[58:33] have to have they need for Spiritual
[58:36] preservation they need God's mercy they
[58:39] just don't they don't recognize they
[58:40] even need it right yeah they don't know
[58:42] they need it why would there be a desire
[58:44] for it there's not a deep calling to the
[58:47] Deep right amen as brother brandom said
[58:49] as the scripture says it's not a deep
[58:51] calling to the Deep
[58:54] amen he prepared an an arc other words
[58:57] he put some wings on his Eagles that
[59:00] they could fly above the judgment and
[59:02] not drown with the
[59:04] chickens well he's very colorful isn't
[59:07] he uh but made a way of an escape in the
[59:10] days of Noah this caused him to do that
[59:12] to provide that way because he's rich in
[59:16] Mercy cuz he was wiping the Earth off
[59:19] but again not to let the innocent perish
[59:22] with the guilty he provided away amen
[59:25] hundred 12 years Noah preached repent
[59:29] get on the ark repent it's going to
[59:30] flood repent get on the ark for 120
[59:33] years he tried to tell them amen but
[59:36] again they didn't realize they needed it
[59:38] because they're telling Noah it it
[59:40] doesn't rain what do you mean rain it
[59:42] doesn't rain there's no such thing as
[59:45] rain it up till that day it never rained
[59:48] God watered the Earth from underneath
[59:51] right it didn't rain they didn't know
[59:52] what rain was you imagine a guy coming
[59:54] and saying it's going to rain and which
[59:57] is literally something that had never
[59:59] happened in the history of humanity yeah
[1:00:01] it's going to rain you think they' think
[1:00:03] he was crazy but if they knew the man in
[1:00:06] his character see that's the thing that
[1:00:08] gets me so many times at people that
[1:00:10] that lead the message you think about
[1:00:13] the character of person I've known a lot
[1:00:15] of people that have spent personal time
[1:00:17] with brother brandom and the testimonies
[1:00:20] I get from all those people of that
[1:00:21] man's character does not match up with
[1:00:25] why people say they leave the
[1:00:28] message a a a liar a manipulator I mean
[1:00:32] it it just doesn't make any sense right
[1:00:34] so you think there's something in there
[1:00:36] that say Hey this Noah I mean what he's
[1:00:39] saying is about as farfetched as I've
[1:00:41] ever heard but that's a good guy he's
[1:00:43] been right before he's of a good
[1:00:45] character he is a good moral man he is a
[1:00:49] godly man amen if someone could even
[1:00:51] look to that capacity and think about
[1:00:53] you know maybe we ought to listen to him
[1:00:55] but for 120 years he preached and nobody
[1:00:58] listened to him but his family amen and
[1:01:02] some of them very possibly reluctantly
[1:01:05] got on just because well that's Daddy I
[1:01:07] think we should do it amen because look
[1:01:10] what happened after the flood but his
[1:01:13] family everyone perished but his family
[1:01:17] so again but God Made A Way amen God God
[1:01:22] always makes a way that the innocent
[1:01:26] would not perish with the
[1:01:28] guilty amen amen but after he has a
[1:01:32] provided way for Fe for people then they
[1:01:35] refuse it now the reason they refuse it
[1:01:38] is because there's nothing there to
[1:01:40] receive it again there's no deep calling
[1:01:43] to the Deep there's nothing there to
[1:01:46] receive it there's nothing uh to receive
[1:01:48] it my mother used to say you can't get
[1:01:50] blood from a turnup amen my parents used
[1:01:54] to say that when I was growing up I
[1:01:56] remember that saying very well can't get
[1:01:58] blood from a turn why can't you get
[1:02:00] blood from a t because there's no blood
[1:02:01] in a turn right amen there's no blood in
[1:02:05] a turnament so if there's no form of
[1:02:07] life in there to receive it then it
[1:02:09] cannot be received again if there's no
[1:02:12] man in the lighthouse screaming out that
[1:02:14] there's uh to the ship that's coming
[1:02:16] that there's land here and you're going
[1:02:18] to wreck up if you try to come any
[1:02:20] further if there's no man there then
[1:02:22] what's it going to
[1:02:23] do it it
[1:02:26] the ship's going to wreck up because
[1:02:28] there's nothing there amen
[1:02:32] God well we make this statement a lot
[1:02:35] but God have mercy I know that's the
[1:02:38] topic of the message today but you think
[1:02:41] about what God have mercy what is it
[1:02:43] these people they just don't have
[1:02:44] anything in them to receive it they have
[1:02:47] no desire for it amen that's why that
[1:02:50] that desire gets filled with so many
[1:02:52] other things as a as a human with a Soul
[1:02:56] they have a capacity there to want to
[1:02:59] have something that would serve God to
[1:03:01] worship God to live for God but but with
[1:03:04] there but when there's no representation
[1:03:07] there all they can do is try to fill
[1:03:09] that with everything else that craving
[1:03:12] then goes to righteous living or uh
[1:03:15] loose living or uh cigarettes or alcohol
[1:03:17] or gambling or whatever it is that that
[1:03:20] goes to everything else and you see the
[1:03:22] world is is catering to the appetites of
[1:03:25] of the human in that way amen it used to
[1:03:28] be where we used to call when I was
[1:03:30] growing up we called Las Vegas Sin City
[1:03:33] right well you never hear that phrase
[1:03:35] anymore people don't say that at all
[1:03:36] anymore in fact the last time I was in
[1:03:39] Vegas on business which I hated going
[1:03:41] every year amen uh uh our business trip
[1:03:45] was in Las Vegas our convention was in
[1:03:47] Las Vegas the last time I was there I
[1:03:50] think it was the last time we stayed at
[1:03:51] the
[1:03:52] NGM and you could literally walk like
[1:03:55] like walking from here into the
[1:03:58] vestibule there with a bigger opening
[1:04:01] not just a door I mean it wasn't fully
[1:04:03] open there was walls short walls on
[1:04:06] either side but you could walk just
[1:04:08] freely right from the arcade where all
[1:04:11] the kids were playing arcade video games
[1:04:13] right into the gambling
[1:04:15] part they were doing everything possible
[1:04:18] just like Satan to bring it all and mesh
[1:04:20] it all together well it's all okay well
[1:04:23] now uh they got they got this I don't
[1:04:26] even know what they call it but uh the
[1:04:29] guy on our team does it where you can
[1:04:31] gamble on anything anywhere pretty much
[1:04:34] uh you can use your phone or online or
[1:04:37] something you can just gamble away
[1:04:38] whatever you you don't need a casino
[1:04:40] anymore right you just uh gambling well
[1:04:43] I think this person's going to win this
[1:04:45] fight or I think this team is going to
[1:04:46] win this game or something and they bet
[1:04:48] all the time he tells me he makes fun of
[1:04:51] me sometimes cuz I pay a little bit of
[1:04:53] money sometimes to get a upgrade to
[1:04:55] First class on my flights and boy does
[1:04:57] it make a huge difference but anyway he
[1:05:00] he makes fun of me for doing that I said
[1:05:01] you just gambled away a hundred bucks I
[1:05:03] only spent $50 for this
[1:05:06] seat what did you get for your 100 bucks
[1:05:10] oh it's the enjoyment the enjoyment of
[1:05:12] letting a hundred hard-earned dollars go
[1:05:15] out the window you just might as well
[1:05:16] put a match to
[1:05:18] it and and then make fun of
[1:05:21] me don't want to go and spend a little
[1:05:23] extra money for a good meal but boy
[1:05:26] they'll make sure and gole down the
[1:05:28] liquor that's $20 a a glass yeah you
[1:05:33] know what I'd rather I'd rather take the
[1:05:35] 20 bucks off of the off the drink and
[1:05:37] buy me a decent steak or or something
[1:05:40] worth anyway just different priorities
[1:05:42] it's my whole point is the priority
[1:05:44] there the desire that's within that is
[1:05:47] within is what is driving the person and
[1:05:50] that's what they feel that desire with
[1:05:53] that's what they feel all that place
[1:05:55] that's supposed to be for God they fill
[1:05:57] it with everything else and the whole
[1:05:59] world is working to make sure and
[1:06:01] satisfy that thirst to satisfy that
[1:06:05] desire to satisfy those Cravings they
[1:06:08] have in there for for the the things of
[1:06:10] the devil I
[1:06:12] mean that's just the bottom line that's
[1:06:15] it's just the things of the devil yes
[1:06:18] that's all it is anyway but you cannot
[1:06:21] again cannot get blood from a turnup
[1:06:25] because there's no blood in a turnup so
[1:06:27] if there is no form of life in there to
[1:06:30] receive it then how can it be received
[1:06:32] if there's no representation in there
[1:06:34] how can it be received how can again
[1:06:37] there ever even be a desire for it if
[1:06:39] there's nothing there to desire it yeah
[1:06:43] amen just think in the natural if there
[1:06:47] was nothing in a human being that if you
[1:06:50] didn't drink any water for a day two
[1:06:52] days week if you didn't drink I don't
[1:06:54] know can you even go without water for a
[1:06:56] week I don't I don't think you can
[1:06:58] actually but if you go on these if
[1:07:01] there's nothing in there if there's no
[1:07:03] control tower in there telling you beep
[1:07:05] beep beep beep you better drink some
[1:07:06] water you're going to die right amen if
[1:07:09] there's nothing in there person would
[1:07:11] just lay down and die from
[1:07:13] dehydration because there's nothing in
[1:07:15] there telling them you better drink or
[1:07:17] you're going to die fortunately for man
[1:07:20] God put that in every human being to say
[1:07:22] beep beep beep you better drink
[1:07:24] something or you're GNA die you better
[1:07:26] eat something or you're going to die God
[1:07:28] put that control tower in every human
[1:07:30] being but look if there's no
[1:07:33] representation in there for the spirit
[1:07:35] of God and for the spiritual part of the
[1:07:37] man then what there's nothing there to a
[1:07:40] you better uh you better make it right
[1:07:43] right right you better get things right
[1:07:45] in your life or you're going to die yeah
[1:07:48] and that death is way worse than the
[1:07:50] natural death right because that's
[1:07:52] separation from God yeah amen there
[1:07:55] separation from God friend we are what's
[1:07:58] the
[1:07:59] point
[1:08:00] uh if there was nothing that God could
[1:08:03] do for us if there was no way that God
[1:08:05] made a provision then what would what
[1:08:07] choice or hope would any of us have amen
[1:08:12] but God Made A Way God chose us God put
[1:08:16] in that our that his his own self that
[1:08:19] representation
[1:08:21] Amen to receive him let's go over to
[1:08:24] Romans chapter n
[1:08:30] amen God literally wants to do it for us
[1:08:33] more than we even want that's right amen
[1:08:36] amen that's just the truth of our human
[1:08:38] nature amen the soul craves for it
[1:08:41] because the soul knows it's going to die
[1:08:43] without it the human nature says Lord
[1:08:47] they there's a resistance there because
[1:08:49] it's the black dog and the white dog
[1:08:50] that's continually fight with each other
[1:08:52] now I know brother brandom said there's
[1:08:54] two dogs inside me like the Indian chief
[1:08:56] said but to me I've always saw the two
[1:08:59] dogs as the Flesh and the spirit Waring
[1:09:02] against each other or the godliness and
[1:09:04] the humanity Waring against each other
[1:09:07] that's kind of the way I've always took
[1:09:08] that story anyway but amen but the truth
[1:09:11] is we've all sinned and come short of
[1:09:13] the glory of God we've all sinned and
[1:09:15] come short of the glory of God and we
[1:09:16] all need God's grace just like Ephesians
[1:09:19] told us where all of us in times past
[1:09:23] amen all of us were groping in dark
[1:09:25] darkness and lying and deceiving and uh
[1:09:28] heathens and Ty we all were amen but God
[1:09:32] who is rich in Mercy praise the Lord
[1:09:36] amen I'm so glad thank God for that
[1:09:38] Mercy Romans
[1:09:40] n amen Let's uh let's start with verse
[1:09:44] 14 now this is right after uh Paul talks
[1:09:48] about the
[1:09:50] God's U giving Grace to one as he says
[1:09:54] it is WR 13th verse says it written
[1:09:56] Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated
[1:09:59] amen but now look 14th verse says but
[1:10:02] what shall we say then is there
[1:10:05] unrighteousness with God now the the
[1:10:07] normal thinking human thinking that does
[1:10:09] sound unrighteous
[1:10:12] amen before now you say well Esau's life
[1:10:16] warranted such Jacob's life warranted
[1:10:19] such but the scripture says before
[1:10:21] either child was
[1:10:23] born so you can't let lay it on what
[1:10:26] they did in life because the Bible says
[1:10:30] before either child was born God loved
[1:10:33] Jacob and hated Esau yes so to the human
[1:10:37] mind natural thinking would say yes that
[1:10:39] is
[1:10:40] unrighteous that that that should not be
[1:10:42] done God's not a just God to think like
[1:10:45] that that's normal human thinking but
[1:10:47] you look and say is there
[1:10:48] unrighteousness with God God forbid amen
[1:10:52] amen How can there be unrighteousness
[1:10:54] with God
[1:10:55] see problem is humans our ways are not
[1:10:58] his ways our thoughts are not his
[1:11:00] thoughts we think of it as something
[1:11:03] that's unnatural but to God everything
[1:11:06] God does has purpose and reason and
[1:11:08] meaning everything there's nothing
[1:11:11] unrighteous everything is uh holy and
[1:11:14] righteous God forbid for he said to
[1:11:17] Moses I will have mercy on whom I will
[1:11:19] have mercy and I will have compassion on
[1:11:22] whom I will have compassion right now
[1:11:24] how does do that he doesn't judge it
[1:11:27] would say by our Deeds but he judges it
[1:11:30] based on who he knows you are based on
[1:11:33] who he knows we are and in our hearts
[1:11:36] and our desires to be for God he knows
[1:11:38] that he knows if our hearts and desire
[1:11:40] is not for God he knows if we're
[1:11:43] pretending he knows if we're putting on
[1:11:45] he knows if we're trying to do something
[1:11:46] that's uh uh to to would say pull the
[1:11:51] cover over others eyes he knows God
[1:11:54] knows he knows our our hearts amen thus
[1:11:57] I will have compassion on who I will
[1:11:59] have compassion 16th verse so then it is
[1:12:03] not of him that willth nor of him that
[1:12:05] runneth but God that showeth Mercy says
[1:12:07] not it it God's mercy upon us than have
[1:12:11] anything to do with your Deeds right
[1:12:13] amen has everything to do with God's
[1:12:16] unconditional love to you because he
[1:12:19] knows who you
[1:12:21] are praise the Lord a lot of times all
[1:12:24] we can see is the outside I mean I I
[1:12:27] I've I've said this before but I've
[1:12:29] known people that uh that we've gone to
[1:12:32] church with and that we've spent time
[1:12:33] and worship with and and all and and uh
[1:12:37] you know 40 years whatever it's been now
[1:12:39] I lose track of a serving the lord and U
[1:12:43] um living for him that you would think
[1:12:47] wow if if any if anybody is going to be
[1:12:51] there it's going to be that person if
[1:12:54] the it if the if the Pearly Gates will
[1:12:58] say uh open for anybody they're going to
[1:13:02] be for that person you ever done that
[1:13:04] that thought to yourself well that
[1:13:06] person's really going and and just
[1:13:07] really I mean to to to the point that um
[1:13:12] I I've actually I I hate to say it this
[1:13:15] way but I don't know who else to say it
[1:13:16] about so I have to say it about myself
[1:13:18] I've actually had people tell me that
[1:13:19] they felt like if I was still here the
[1:13:21] Rapture didn't take
[1:13:23] place and you ever everybody said tell
[1:13:25] you tell that amen if you're still here
[1:13:29] that's their uh uh way of knowing the
[1:13:32] Rapture has not taking place because you
[1:13:34] are going to go in the Rapture period
[1:13:37] amen I had a lady one time uh I think
[1:13:40] it's one time we were flying to uh the
[1:13:43] convention or whatever it was business
[1:13:45] back in Charlotte and her daughter had
[1:13:48] lukemia and they were going to
[1:13:50] Washington and we saw them at the
[1:13:52] airport strangely enough and she looked
[1:13:55] over at her husband when I sat down she
[1:13:57] looked over at her husband she said oh
[1:13:59] thank God good Christian lady you know
[1:14:01] for what she knew uh she looked at her
[1:14:04] husband oh thank God uh and her husband
[1:14:07] says what do you mean he said well
[1:14:09] Newton's on this plane she said if
[1:14:11] Newton's on this plane nothing's going
[1:14:12] to happen to it our flights are going to
[1:14:14] be
[1:14:15] great amen I mean that that's not an
[1:14:19] attribute a tribute to me that's a
[1:14:21] tribute to God Amen that that's to him
[1:14:25] to understand that it's him in our lives
[1:14:29] doing this so that other people can see
[1:14:31] Christ so that other people recognize
[1:14:34] there is a God Amen not just as so many
[1:14:37] of the churches today would see there's
[1:14:39] a God yeah there's there's a God 10 20
[1:14:42] 30 40,000 years ago there's a God yeah
[1:14:45] he's somewhere in the stratosphere
[1:14:47] somewhere we don't know exactly where he
[1:14:49] is some Stars some planets some
[1:14:50] something up there and that's what a lot
[1:14:52] of people believe you know brother ROM
[1:14:54] said said that back in that time in the
[1:14:56] 60s when they started shooting Rockets
[1:14:58] up up into space those astronauts would
[1:15:01] come back and people would ask him well
[1:15:03] did you see God up there said no we
[1:15:05] didn't see anything a lot of people quit
[1:15:07] believing God just because astronauts
[1:15:08] didn't see him out of their Rockets up
[1:15:10] there that's the way some people believe
[1:15:13] yeah amen but to bring a living risen
[1:15:17] God right here in
[1:15:19] flesh amen that makes God real that
[1:15:23] makes God uh present flesh amen same
[1:15:29] today as he was yesterday not a god of
[1:15:32] history but a god of right
[1:15:33] now it's not a god of it's not a man of
[1:15:36] him that willth or him that run God that
[1:15:38] shows
[1:15:40] Mercy for the scripture saith unto
[1:15:42] Pharaoh even for this same purpose have
[1:15:45] I raised thee up that I might show my
[1:15:47] power in thee that my name might be
[1:15:49] declared throughout all the Earth
[1:15:52] therefore hath he Mercy on whom he will
[1:15:54] have mercy and whom he will he Harden
[1:15:58] and we know he did that with
[1:16:00] Pharaoh thou Willl say then unto me why
[1:16:04] do he yet find fault for who hath
[1:16:07] resisted his will nay but old man who
[1:16:10] art thou that repliest against God here
[1:16:14] we go now you say well that that's just
[1:16:16] unfair that's just unjust

[1:16:25] that formed it why hast Thou made me
[1:16:28] thus hath not the Potter power over the
[1:16:31] clay of the same lump to make one vessel
[1:16:34] unto honor and another vessel of
[1:16:36] Dishonor praise the Lord amen it's God
[1:16:40] Amen it's up to God it's in God's hands
[1:16:43] who we to say he's unjust he's the one
[1:16:45] that created me he's the one who made me
[1:16:50] he's the one who would say that there is
[1:16:52] no God he is the one who made those that
[1:16:55] would scoff at God he's the one who made
[1:16:57] those that would look at this and say
[1:16:59] that is not a just God well he's the one
[1:17:03] who made you how can you tell him what
[1:17:06] to do he has power over the clay he's
[1:17:10] the Potter he says what comes and goes
[1:17:13] he says what he says what is right and
[1:17:16] wrong amen he knows what is in the heart
[1:17:19] of man praise the Lord what what if God
[1:17:23] willing to show his wrath and to make
[1:17:25] his power known endured with such with
[1:17:28] much longsuffering the vessels of Wrath
[1:17:30] fitted to destruction and that he might
[1:17:33] make known The Riches of his glory on
[1:17:35] the vessels of Mercy which he had afor
[1:17:38] prepared unto Glory even us whom he hath
[1:17:42] called not of the Jews only but also of
[1:17:45] the
[1:17:46] Gentiles praise the Lord also of the
[1:17:49] Gentiles also of us those of us who had
[1:17:53] no life who had no
[1:17:56] hope we
[1:17:58] friends we
[1:18:01] derived from God's mercy amen we are
[1:18:04] here only because of the mercies of God
[1:18:08] we are in this building we are in this
[1:18:10] life we are in uh this flesh only
[1:18:14] because of the mercies of God we are
[1:18:17] only Servants of his children of his
[1:18:20] because of his Mercy that's the only way
[1:18:23] amen look at this in the
[1:18:27] token in Jeffersonville token I know
[1:18:30] there's about five of them four or five
[1:18:31] I lose track but this is the one in
[1:18:33] Jeffersonville he said the life that God
[1:18:35] has
[1:18:36] said the that the day you eat thereof
[1:18:39] that day you die then there had been a
[1:18:42] substitutionary life taken for the life
[1:18:45] of the believer now he said that and he
[1:18:47] meant it but God then took a
[1:18:50] substitutionary
[1:18:52] life for the life of the believer
[1:18:55] God in Mercy accepted a substitute for
[1:18:59] the life of the defiled person and that
[1:19:01] was us we were the defiled people yes
[1:19:05] amen God accepted a substitute his son
[1:19:08] Jesus Christ who was perfect and done no
[1:19:11] wrong died at Calvary shed his blood and
[1:19:14] provided that way so that we would be
[1:19:16] able to have a way yes amen we he did he
[1:19:20] did for we the defiled persons we were
[1:19:23] the defiled people when his child had
[1:19:26] defiled himself with sin of disbelieving
[1:19:29] the word then God rich in Mercy made a
[1:19:32] substitute and that was something that
[1:19:35] had to die in his place amen something
[1:19:39] had to die in our place yes I remember
[1:19:42] brother brandham uh uh talking about u a
[1:19:47] man that had come up to I think it was a
[1:19:49] man that had come up to him trying to
[1:19:51] remember the quote now and this man said
[1:19:53] that uh after after the service he come
[1:19:56] up to brother brandham and said brother
[1:19:58] brandham I used to have a lot of
[1:20:00] confidence in you till you said that you
[1:20:02] ate breakf uh you ate bacon and eggs for
[1:20:04] breakfast he said how could you eat such
[1:20:06] a
[1:20:07] thing he lost confidence in brother
[1:20:10] brandom just because you ate bacon eggs
[1:20:12] now obviously the person was a vegan or
[1:20:14] they have vegan at that time a
[1:20:16] vegetarian yeah so he said how could you
[1:20:20] uh uh uh eat something like that the
[1:20:23] bacon and the eggs how could you do that
[1:20:25] and brother Ram says well you alive or
[1:20:27] I'm paraphrasing well yes sir oh well
[1:20:31] you know that that you live on dead
[1:20:34] substance right only way you can live
[1:20:37] Human is on dead substance he said oh
[1:20:39] sir you know I just had some bread or
[1:20:42] wheat or lettuce or whatever it was he
[1:20:44] said well whatever you had had to die
[1:20:46] for you to live right whether it's the
[1:20:49] wheat the wheat had to die yes whether
[1:20:51] it's the the the the corn the corn had
[1:20:54] to die whether it's the lettuce the
[1:20:56] lettuce had to Die the radish the
[1:20:58] Cucumber the vegetables whatever it was
[1:21:01] it had to die for you to eat it to live
[1:21:03] yes we live off dead substance whether
[1:21:07] it's a pig or whether it's an ear a corn
[1:21:09] we all live on dead substance right amen
[1:21:12] now some people argue about the
[1:21:14] healthiness of it and that's that's a
[1:21:16] different argument for some people but
[1:21:17] that wasn't the argument this man gave
[1:21:20] right amen he tried to help the man
[1:21:22] understand you humans have to live on
[1:21:26] dead substance as a human spiritually
[1:21:30] friend the only way we can lie live is
[1:21:33] off a dead substance the only way that
[1:21:36] we can have a a spiritual life of life
[1:21:38] eternal is because someone gave their
[1:21:41] life for us that's the only way by the
[1:21:44] mercies of God that we can live Jesus
[1:21:48] Christ gave his life he showed shed his
[1:21:51] blood through his mercy so that we could
[1:21:53] have life amen he did it once he did it
[1:21:56] for all that blood was flowing free it
[1:22:00] is Flowing free today for who whosoever
[1:22:04] will
[1:22:05] amen God help us thank God he made that
[1:22:10] way but we live off of dead substance
[1:22:12] not just physically but spiritually yes
[1:22:15] we live off of dead substance no matter
[1:22:17] what it is only way we can live only way
[1:22:20] we can survive is off a dead substance
[1:22:23] only way we survive spiritually is off a
[1:22:25] dead substance yes amen God makes that
[1:22:28] way God made the
[1:22:31] substitute and accepted the substitute
[1:22:34] now
[1:22:35] Cain Cain thought that it took botney
[1:22:38] life amen didn't realize or didn't
[1:22:42] strike him as Revelation that it took
[1:22:45] blood which is what God used to bring
[1:22:47] Adam and Eve back into the presence of
[1:22:49] God
[1:22:50] again it had to be blood yes but Adam
[1:22:54] but Cain thought well that's just fine I
[1:22:56] just I'll bring in the best I got he did
[1:22:59] all the altar was perfect it was nice
[1:23:02] everything he got was all it was except
[1:23:04] would have been probably probably way
[1:23:06] more beautiful than than Abel's
[1:23:08] sacrifice Abel's sacrifice was an animal
[1:23:10] bleeding dying with blood splatter
[1:23:12] splattered all over the place but at C's
[1:23:15] beautiful uh garnished in flowers and
[1:23:18] and everything and the fruits the best
[1:23:20] the vegetables and everything that he
[1:23:21] had to offer to God but God rejected it
[1:23:24] why because there was no life of
[1:23:27] substitute in them there's no soul in
[1:23:29] botney life there's no excuse me there's
[1:23:32] no spirit in boty life amen but there
[1:23:35] had to be something D spiritually
[1:23:39] Bloodshed because the life is in the
[1:23:41] blood yes when the hemoglobin breaks
[1:23:44] there's life that comes out of that and
[1:23:46] in in the life of God come off and into
[1:23:49] the worshipper into the believer and
[1:23:52] that blood is what changed us and made
[1:23:55] us receive by his Mercy that truth that
[1:24:00] God has shed for us that that that that
[1:24:04] life that God has GI for
[1:24:06] us amen look now let's get back to uh
[1:24:11] Jehovah JY part
[1:24:17] two Lille
[1:24:19] Kentucky he said if a man know look now
[1:24:25] very uh we we understand this very
[1:24:28] striking if a man know he was naked you
[1:24:32] could talk to him and tell him you're
[1:24:36] naked oh my I am I better get some
[1:24:39] clothes on you could tell him something
[1:24:41] it's when he's naked and doesn't realize
[1:24:43] it that's the problem as we've said
[1:24:46] before if a man was naked if he knew he
[1:24:49] was naked you could talk to him but when
[1:24:52] but when you don't know that you're
[1:24:54] naked that's a miserable shape pitiful
[1:24:58] he brother Braham said now don't Scorn
[1:25:00] the people but have
[1:25:03] mercy have mercy right what if that was
[1:25:08] you in that condition and again but for
[1:25:12] the grace of God there go I right amen
[1:25:15] amen what if that was you in that
[1:25:17] condition what if the word wasn't
[1:25:20] revealed to you right my I I don't even
[1:25:24] like like to Fathom that or think about
[1:25:27] that what would you do what else would
[1:25:31] matter if your eyes was so blind you
[1:25:34] couldn't see it yeah that's a miserable
[1:25:36] sight and what is this Le deia age poor
[1:25:40] miserable
[1:25:42] blind wretched naked don't know it why
[1:25:44] they don't know it because they're blind
[1:25:46] that's right poor miserable richer than
[1:25:49] it's ever been probably we're probably
[1:25:52] living in a day as rich as humans have
[1:25:54] ever been
[1:25:56] monetarily but
[1:25:58] poor
[1:26:00] miserable blind wretched naked don't
[1:26:03] know
[1:26:04] it m so where does that put us
[1:26:08] God it's it puts us in a miserable
[1:26:11] condition now in in
[1:26:14] Matthew I got to read a couple more
[1:26:16] scriptures here I'm going to close in
[1:26:18] Matthew
[1:26:22] now chapter 5
[1:26:24] Beatitudes one of my favorite scriptures
[1:26:27] in the entire
[1:26:28] Bible amen that's tough to say
[1:26:32] considering it's the Bible but one of my
[1:26:36] favorites God helped me to continue to
[1:26:38] try to my best to live up to this but
[1:26:40] Matthew 5:7
[1:26:42] says blessed are the merciful for they
[1:26:47] shall obtain Mercy right one of my if
[1:26:51] I'm if I'm going to expect to receive
[1:26:53] Mercy from God then I'm going to have to
[1:26:56] be merciful to others amen that's the
[1:26:59] way of of receiving
[1:27:02] Mercy the merciful shall obtain mercy so
[1:27:07] if I want to receive Mercy from God I've
[1:27:10] got to be willing to give it what did
[1:27:11] Brother randam say don't scorn that
[1:27:13] person have mercy on you amen amen have
[1:27:17] mercy pray for that it may be some
[1:27:19] anything more than just praying for that
[1:27:21] person praying for Humanity in general
[1:27:24] but pray for that person if it's
[1:27:25] something that just strikes your heart
[1:27:27] like that you see so many nowadays uh
[1:27:31] that really you know they need God Amen
[1:27:34] like brother Dennis said in his prayer
[1:27:36] first and foremost of anything of
[1:27:37] anytime when we pray and uh pray for
[1:27:40] healings and things the number one thing
[1:27:42] that we want more than anything is that
[1:27:43] person's salvation amen that's number
[1:27:46] one first and
[1:27:48] foremost but if we want Mercy we've got
[1:27:51] to be willing to give Mercy yes amen we
[1:27:55] we not just be willing but to give
[1:27:58] Mercy I need to be merciful to you I
[1:28:01] need to be merciful to those that are
[1:28:03] around me if I want to because again if
[1:28:06] it weren't for the grace of God I'd be
[1:28:08] right there with them right amen thank
[1:28:12] God for his unmar grace favor
[1:28:16] Mercy amen Psalms chapter uh 103
[1:28:25] as I said I have a couple more
[1:28:27] scriptures to read and I'm going to
[1:28:28] close here and one more quote that uh I
[1:28:32] got from uh years
[1:28:35] ago when I had this disagreement with a
[1:28:38] brother we'll get into that in just a
[1:28:39] minute about be too much longer though
[1:28:41] Psalms 103 verse 8 1038 the Lord is
[1:28:46] merciful and
[1:28:48] gracious slow to anger and plenteous
[1:28:52] plenteous praise the Lord he is
[1:28:54] plenteous in Mercy he will not always
[1:28:58] chide neither will he keep his anger
[1:29:03] forever he had listened now this is
[1:29:06] Beautiful s this goes right over with us
[1:29:09] to First John 3 if you look at this he
[1:29:13] had not dealt with us after our sins
[1:29:17] praise the
[1:29:18] Lord thank God nor rewarded us Accord
[1:29:24] according to our
[1:29:25] iniquities again thank you Lord Jesus
[1:29:29] thank amen he hasn't rewarded US based
[1:29:32] on our iniquities he has not uh uh uh uh
[1:29:36] dealt with us according to our
[1:29:38] sins because of his grace because of his
[1:29:41] Mercy he has not dealt with us according
[1:29:43] to our sin or rewarded us according to
[1:29:46] our iniquities remember we said the
[1:29:48] other day amen the grace and mercy of
[1:29:51] God receiving that that we don't deserve
[1:29:55] and not receiving what we should be
[1:29:57] getting amen we should be going to hell
[1:30:00] we should be uh in sickness and dark
[1:30:03] chaos we should be uh we should have
[1:30:06] died on the cross we should be dead am
[1:30:10] but God in his Rich Mercy amen he
[1:30:12] doesn't reward us according to our
[1:30:14] iniquity praise the Lord what is
[1:30:16] Iniquity it's doing something you know
[1:30:18] you shouldn't do or not doing something
[1:30:20] you know you should do yes that's
[1:30:22] iniquity it's Lawless
[1:30:24] but God doesn't reward us according to
[1:30:28] that he looks at he doesn't look at that
[1:30:31] he looks through the blood yeah amen and
[1:30:33] your red Sin through the red blood of
[1:30:35] Christ is white as
[1:30:37] snow praise the
[1:30:39] Lord amen for as high is for for as the
[1:30:44] heaven is high above the Earth so great
[1:30:47] is his Mercy toward them that fear him
[1:30:50] as far as the East is from the West so
[1:30:53] far hath he removed our
[1:30:56] transgressions from us how do we get any
[1:30:58] further than that Saints
[1:31:01] amen praise the Lord Psalms 106 page
[1:31:04] over
[1:31:07] 1061 praise ye the
[1:31:10] Lord oh give thanks unto the Lord amen
[1:31:14] for he is good for his mercy endureth
[1:31:18] forever praise
[1:31:22] God thank the Lord for it where would we
[1:31:25] be without it amen God help us one quote
[1:31:29] I said again found this quote a long
[1:31:31] time ago there was
[1:31:35] uh well in in North Carolina but about
[1:31:38] the time I got to Florida there was a
[1:31:40] brother that started coming to our
[1:31:41] church not long after we moved there um
[1:31:45] and uh I won't go into all the details
[1:31:48] of things that he doctrinally believed
[1:31:50] but one of the things he believed but
[1:31:52] that it was Mercy was over
[1:31:55] Mercy was over of course the
[1:31:57] conversations we kept having got us to
[1:32:00] the point that he put Mercy ending
[1:32:03] before I was ever
[1:32:05] born I said well and we were on the
[1:32:07] phone I said brother you just put me out
[1:32:10] you just put me out of the kingdom of
[1:32:12] God CU what you're saying I wasn't even
[1:32:14] born
[1:32:15] then well well you know it's like this
[1:32:18] and then and you know by by the time
[1:32:21] he's done it's a 12T long chalk Bo that
[1:32:24] looks like some physicist uh Steven
[1:32:27] Hawking or somebody wrote up that nobody
[1:32:29] can understand but four people on the
[1:32:31] planet and I'm thinking what does any of
[1:32:35] that mean
[1:32:38] brother nothing but it has to go to all
[1:32:42] those degrees to try to explain or
[1:32:44] Reason away all the truths that are
[1:32:47] evident in God's
[1:32:49] word I found this I gave it to him I
[1:32:53] read it to him I I told it to him
[1:32:55] questions and answers
[1:32:57] 1964 August
[1:33:00] 1964 brotherr
[1:33:02] Brown some say Mercy is over and no one
[1:33:06] can be saved and that was his belief he
[1:33:09] believed that amen now I understand the
[1:33:12] point of the Lamb's Book of Life and all
[1:33:14] that but you don't get to the point that
[1:33:16] you say uh Mercy is over no one else can
[1:33:18] be saved that that's not that's not the
[1:33:22] point that brother Brandon was making
[1:33:23] when he preached like uh uh the breach
[1:33:28] message and uh and even in into the
[1:33:30] seals it wasn't that wasn't the point
[1:33:34] Christ Miss U uh the Feast of the
[1:33:36] trumpets god brother God didn't allow
[1:33:38] brother R preach these things to bring
[1:33:40] this point that there's Mercy's over and
[1:33:43] that's what some people sit there think
[1:33:45] well Mercy's over no one can be saved
[1:33:47] that's what this believe that's what
[1:33:49] this brother believed so I gave him this
[1:33:51] quote you want to hear Brother bram's
[1:33:53] answer I think you know brother bram's
[1:33:55] answer but uh now is that true question
[1:33:59] I'm glad I've got this one brother
[1:34:01] randam said we watch and pray we watch
[1:34:03] the prayer lines it seems some are still
[1:34:07] it seems some are still finding Mercy
[1:34:09] now that's the first question you got
[1:34:11] too he said is Mercy over brother bram's
[1:34:16] qu that's the question brother bram's
[1:34:18] answer don't never think that amen that
[1:34:23] that settles it for me yes and people
[1:34:26] say well
[1:34:28] well you know they they put two and two
[1:34:31] here and they do this and do all this
[1:34:32] math to make this come out to where it's
[1:34:34] like this and but brother random said I
[1:34:36] said well you know brother Ram said
[1:34:37] don't never think that so you know what
[1:34:40] I'm going to do I'm not going to think
[1:34:42] that way right amen amen even if I've
[1:34:45] told you before there will be a time
[1:34:49] where there will be on this Earth that
[1:34:52] nobody else is going to get in or out
[1:34:54] right just like brother brandom talked
[1:34:57] about with Noah's heart it was a time
[1:34:59] that they were still there but nobody
[1:35:02] could there would be nobody else could
[1:35:03] come in be on the door knocking trying
[1:35:05] to get in the five foolish virgins oh
[1:35:08] give to us no you got to go get for
[1:35:10] yourself by the time they did all that
[1:35:13] the bride left amen see but brother
[1:35:17] brandom said so there is that time but
[1:35:19] I'm I'm I'm not going to I'm not going
[1:35:21] to denote that time to say that time is
[1:35:24] right now I don't know only God knows
[1:35:27] but brother Brown said don't never think
[1:35:30] that so you know what I'm going to do I
[1:35:31] am not ever going to think like that
[1:35:34] amen amen yes praise the Lord because I
[1:35:38] want everyone
[1:35:40] that I I I I want everyone to make it
[1:35:45] right but
[1:35:46] if five more
[1:35:49] minutes five more
[1:35:51] hours five more days five more months
[1:35:53] five more years can bring one more soul
[1:35:56] in and
[1:35:58] Lord let it be yes amen one more Soul if
[1:36:03] it takes that Lord let it be whatever it
[1:36:05] is amen because he is rich in
[1:36:09] Mercy we should also be merciful to
[1:36:13] share that mercy and if say I'm tired of
[1:36:17] being here well that shouldn't be a
[1:36:19] reason to go home anyway being tired of
[1:36:21] here shouldn't be a reason to go home
[1:36:23] amen I'm sick of this place doesn't
[1:36:26] matter that shouldn't be a reason to
[1:36:28] want to leave here amen amen if God has
[1:36:30] us here for a purpose God wants us here
[1:36:33] there's a reason yes amen and if that
[1:36:36] extenuating of Mercy is helpful to
[1:36:39] someone else to come in then praise the
[1:36:41] Lord amen let them come in I want I as
[1:36:45] many and all that can yes amen praise
[1:36:48] the Lord God rich in his Mercy let's
[1:36:50] stand if we could amen
[1:36:55] God rich in his Mercy to
[1:36:57] me even when I might not do what I
[1:37:02] should or how I should or might make
[1:37:04] mistakes or come up short or get caught
[1:37:07] in trap or something God still that
[1:37:09] doesn't change God's mercy yes he
[1:37:11] doesn't reward based on iniquity yes
[1:37:14] amen he rewards based on whom he will he
[1:37:18] told us yes amen he told us whom he will
[1:37:22] have mercy he will have mercy yes amen
[1:37:26] so I I just believe that's that's his
[1:37:29] word that's the truth amen amen praise
[1:37:32] the Lord let's sing this course amen
[1:37:35] before we go today Mercy rewrote my
[1:37:39] life amen we sing it to start the
[1:37:41] service let's sing it to finish because
[1:37:44] I'm so thankful God's Mercy is what
[1:37:46] rewrote my life yes amen my life looked
[1:37:51] written when I was younger then it got
[1:37:53] Rewritten and then it got Rewritten and
[1:37:55] then God came into my life and every bit
[1:37:58] of that went out the window amen and it
[1:38:01] was
[1:38:03] Rewritten completely fully finally amen
[1:38:08] because I became his praise the Lord
[1:38:13] Mercy

[1:38:17] [Music]
