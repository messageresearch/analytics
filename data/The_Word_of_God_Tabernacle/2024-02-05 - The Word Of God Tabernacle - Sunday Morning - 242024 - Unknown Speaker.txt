worship the one we adore hallelujah amen his name is Jesus and he is the same yesterday today and forever amen glory to the Lord Jesus couple prayer requests to mention to you before we go to the Lord in prayer uh as we all know remember brother Dennis is out of town him and his wife sister Leah they went out to uh uh his her stepdad's memorial service in Georgia uh they were driving also down to Florida to meet with uh uh someone that Leah wanted to try to help minister to uh having some difficulties so please remember them in prayer they're supposed to be back uh Tuesday or Wednesday I forget now uh so please remember them in prayer if you would the Lord just continue to bless their trip and bring them back safe grant them traveling mercies also as most of you probably know sister liia has been in the hospital uh she's had some stomach issues she's supposed to have an MRI today uh and uh just look and see what the the doctors find and she does thank everyone for your prayers so amen thank you for your prayers for sister Lydia but we don't want to stop just continue to remember her in your prayers today if you would also got a text from sister sheilia uh she could probably tell you better than I could read the text but she says no she's having a sword that's appeared on the the right of her right eye uh and a growing sword with the cancer treatment all that thing that she had gone through uh it was kind of expected but it's sort of at the wind the end of the two-month window uh these things kind of popping up so she just asked that we would continue to pray for her and for that situation and that sore by her eye today so remember that in prayer for sister sheilia uh also sister Julie put in a prayer request for her sister Kristen uh Kristen is very faithful to her tithing to this church although she's never set foot that door uh uh believe that the Lord's hand is on her however the Lord just bless her uh but she's uh leaving today to go to Phoenix to a conference and sister Julie asked that we pray that the god that God would Grant her traveling mercies keeping her angels He camped about her wherever she goes uh may it be a good blessed prosperous trip for her thank you God bless you amen for sister Julie also uh got a text just a little bit ago from Danny he's on his way into church he got about to print and Fort L and his break started going out on his car uh so please remember brother Danny said we'd be praying for him he didn't say whether he was going to continue to try to come on or go back home but I think he was closer to home than he was here so he probably went back home and the fact that he's not here probably uh would lend Credence to that so I'm guessing brother Danny went back home if you're watching brother we're praying for you know he's had difficulty here and there with his car uh but we just remember that brother Dan the Lord would just touch him and and uh and help him in his situation I this see each one of you amen welcome to the house of the Lord greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus he's so good is he amen uh pray for me I always forget to do this so I'm kind of trying to get in the habit of doing it I'm traveling driving to Las Cruses today for work this week so appreciate your prayers there I went and saw the U the physical therapist Tuesday um she didn't do much but evaluate me and give me a few things for uh a little bit of exercise stretches if you will to try to help uh my quadded started atrophying uh my glutes weren't really uh kicking in like they were supposed to to try to help support all that so the thing she gave me was to try to help support that and then I'm supposed to go back twice a week for the next three or four weeks um on my week home uh to get that better to strengthen it more to do more exercise but I will tell you I I bought the impared sister matis uh two months ago I've been month and a half I forgot dear remind me it's been a couple months ago so I've been faithful to try to use that even when I'm out of town I take it with me uh I don't know if it works or not but uh I have been using it Faithfully I've read online a couple places that it is supposed to help but it takes 10 to 12 weeks to see any results uh so uh after I saw the physical therapist and my faithfulness to the inform red treatment I've been doing my knee feels a lot better actually it's doing much better so I'm very happy about that uh usually uh I take my my bag and my tool bag usually they about 50 pounds a piece which is about the airport uh Airline limit uh of course I have some I could do up to 70 pounds but anyway they're both right at 50 and when I take them down the stairs with that added weight it usually puts a real strain in my knee hurts and it didn't do it last night uh I felt a little twinged but nothing like it had been in the past so thank you for your prayers because that's the number one thing um but uh the Lord has really touched it I feel much better so I'm thankful for that probably more of a testimony I guess than a prayer request but uh I appreciate that amen Miss sister Pat this morning not being here amen so but we're thankful for being hereen thank the Lord bless us did you have a request my sister she has kids your sister the one by hton yes oh my when did she find out mon goodness remember what's her name brother Pat Lind Linda brother Pat's sister Linda has cancer so let's just remember our in prayers Mr mati did you have something real quick I got a call late last night from a jail in Yellowstone in villains Montana called yellow detention center and it was someone that I met last year um and um I got involved with his family and he called me because he was there in bills and he asked for prayer because he said he was he's been arrested and he said it was unlawful they took his car new car and and he and he needs um um a proon attorney so got I'm even see what I can find but he's been a struggling Christian what's his name mark Lopez okay so we remember and so that was the beginning coming back to Christ but so I don't know just what kind of you know really what the truth is about this bu in Montana he called me late night asking amen amen remember him in prayer anybody knows that I don't know I think Peter MCB got a lawyer's license but he doesn't do anything like that but he moved to Boston so anyway praise the Lord any have unspoken request so very glad to have brother John Thornton with us today from North Carolina I haven't seen him in so long uh but it doesn't look like he changed a bit but I guess maybe I've had people tell me that too I guess we just getting older that's all amen but so very glad to have brother John with us and thankful let's stand to our

[Music] are praise the Lord church amen amen good to be in the house of the Lord praise the Lord amen appreciate brother uh Newton oon his pull pit who said it's been a a long long time I remember the first time he came to Durham and preached he he he's a little bigger now than he was then but he was nothing but a string being back then and uh but he could preach and uh we just appreciate it and like I said we haven't been in much contact over the years except uh we hadn't forgotten it uh you don't forget people that you meet that make an impact on your life and uh we just certainly appreciate it I know uh you've had a lot of great ministers come through and preach I I can assure you one thing you won't be disappointed in this you might be disappointed in this but you'll never be disappointed in the word because it is our absolute and you won't scare me if you say Amen W scare me if you shout won't scare me if you run amen you know I'm just uh I'm oldfashioned you notice I don't have a computer I don't have an iPad uh I've got one I just don't know how to use it uh my son keep telling me I'm going to teach you how to put all this stuff on your iPad I said well as long as I can write it down I don't have to worry about the battery going dead amen amen but I just appreciate the Lord today and uh uh uh brother Bennett said we uh we're getting old but uh one day we're going to be young again amen one day there's going to be another spring and uh all the the problems the hip problems I have and the shoulder problems I have the knee problems that I have all those are going to vanish away amen and you talking about running through the Hills of Glory I'm going to make a noise amen amen and uh we just appreciate the Lord today Jesus I'm not a long-winded preacher uh if I get too long brother Newton just give it up cut cut sign short in other words just cut it off you know uh but we just appreciate the Lord I found out this a long time ago it's not the it's not the uh the uh quantity but it's the quality yes amen and I tell you what I love this book I uh I I don't mind telling you i' I've been serving the lord since I was about 11 years old and I'm just turned 81 last month and uh he's sweeter today than he's ever been before the Lord amen I love him more today than I ever loved him before you know I U it's kind of like I uh talking to my wife we uh our anniversary is coming up next month and we' be married 56 years and U I looked at her brother new the other day and I said you know I don't know why am I not on I never can figure these things out o n is on all the way on is that on on yeah that sounds good that do you yeah Okay I uh I told her I said you know I don't know why it took me so long to love you this much and uh I I feel that way about the Lord you know every day he gets sweeter and I it just seems like I just love him more amen and and you know maybe it's because we're getting close to going home and we realize that that that hour is swiftly approaching us and uh we just desire to be in his presence and see him so much so much more that we just seem to love him that much more amen amen but we just appreciate the Lord and I'll stop rambling and let's turn in our scripture if you would uh just a couple of single verses in the Book of Psalms amen and maybe the Lord just bless his word and uh give us something that uh will encourage us and and help us in our journey and in our and our battle against Satan and our walk with the Lord I uh I am not a a real flamboyant Speer speaker as I said but uh if I can as Paul said stir up your mind by way of remembrance yes to help you remember that what God has done and not liveing the past but what God has done he could do it again I believe the question was asked one time what did it mean when the disciples took up the 12 fragments basket full of fragments after Jesus had fed the 5,000 and the answer was that if he done it one time he can do it again amen and I'd ask you you ever been blessed by God and God can do it again you been healed by God God can do it again there's absolutely nothing impossible with him right amen our our secret today is putting faith in God my wife is going through a terrible thing with our she has gloma in uh in her eye she's just about lost her sight in her in her right eye Cataract and she had surgery and she's going through all kinds of injections in her eyes and everything but you know brother came to the to the church there in the little town of ramor and by the way I failed to mention they send their greetings brother Ln Stanley amen that brother uh Newton knows and he said that just preached the church in uh give them their regards but preacher came not long ago and he he preached and he prayed for Carolyn at the end of the uh end of the service and God made a promise to her and you know we like Miracles I like to see God do it right then amen but sometime it's a progressive thing amen when I was 12 years old if I can just tell you this little testimony when I was 12 years old that doctors G me up to die they told my parents take him home put in bed give a Bo aspirin four times a day if he lives a year he'll be lucky I had acute heart uh romatic fever and back then they didn't have all the heart stuff they had now I went to church one night and I got in the prayer line and the preacher's name was George Jones not the country music singer but his name was George Jones he prayed for me and brother Newton I didn't feel anything I didn't shout I didn't fall out under the spirit I didn't run the out I didn't do nothing I went home the next morning I got on my bicycle which was one thing they told me never to do and I got on my bicycle and I took off riding through town amen amen I was healed and I didn't even know I was healed praise the Lord amen when they drafted from the Army the Army said you never had any heart trouble I said oh yes I did well go bring a letter from the doctor so I went and got letters from the doctors and they spelled out all the problems that I had how I was giv up to die and at the bottom of the page they said he was miraculously cured praise the Lord amen amen amen but I went from a last physical they said your heart is is about 20 years younger than you are so thank God for that today amen I just appreciate the Lord Psalms chapter 31 amen we'll read one verse there and uh then we'll read uh another verse over in u the 61st chapter and I want to get back and uh have one verse in Samuel Psalms chapter 31 and verse three for thou art my rock and my Fortress therefore for thy name's sake lead me and guide me can the church say amen amen that's a good prayer to pray lead me and guide me yes in Psalm chapter 61 and verse one the psalmist David writing again he said Hear My Cry Oh God attend unto my prayer from the ends of the Earth will I cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I amen for thou has has been a shelter for me and a strong long Tower from my enemy thank you Lord amen now if I could read one more scripture in 1 Samuel chapter 2 Samuel says there is none holy as the Lord amen for there is none besides thee neither is there any Rock like our God amen amen I just appreciate that those scriptures today amen God bless you father we thank you for your word today for our presence in the house of the Lord we pray that you just come and minister to us Lord give us ears to hear heart to receive that that you speak to us forgive your servant of any false failures or sins that would hinder your word from going forth today hide me behind the Cross May the words be those inspired by you and not my own in Jesus name amen praise the Lord God bless you you can have your seat we appreciate the Lord we're talking to brother Newton last night and and uh you know uh pastors have a a real uh responsibility about protecting their pull pit and not letting uh things come in that uh shouldn't be preached and kind of want but after talk to him for a little while I found out that we were we were both on the same playing field amen I think we have a pretty good balance in the scripture that's what it's all about is having a balance in the word of God today right and and here we have a man by the name of David and you know David was uh one that that God referred to him as the apple of his eye even when he did wrong God still loved him yes even when you do wrong God still loves you yes come on say amen amen when you when you make your mistakes God still loves you today right and and David you know if we look at at his life you know uh when when God spoke to Samuel and sent him down to anoint a king for Israel David was the most unlikely candidate you could find sure of all of his brothers that were strong and and muscular and probably intellectual and and knew all the things about life and whatever David was the least the least qualified and the least one that you would expect for God to pick to make the king out of Israel amen amen sometime I look and brother D I ask God why me yeah you know why did you choose me for this responsibility and maybe you asked yourself the same question have all the people in my family and all the people in my relatives and people I know why is it that God let me see this great truth in this hour and all of those others just go the way they go and never seem to carry anything even about God yes but he was little David you know and uh he was a he was a Shepherd boy and out minding his sheep and minding his own business amen and alone came God yes you know I I didn't go seeking for him I never went looking for God Amen but he came looking for me he may have found you taking care of the sheep he may found you in the Baptist or the Methodist or Presby or wherever he may have found you but when he came looking for you amen aren't you glad you were able to say Lord here am I amen amen it was him that impressed upon you what you needed to do in order to become a son or a daughter of God but David was out here taking to the Sheep doing nothing and and and God uh uh uh ended up sending him down to the valley V where his brothers were in the fox holes you know peeping out looking at this massive giant called gath and and you know the story how that David went out and his reputation began to be buil amen and the fact that he said you know I come to you Amen in the name of the Lord you come to me with your swords and your Spears and your Shields I come to you in the name of the Lord I don't know about you church but today my defense is this book right here hallelujah it's not in my intellect it's not in what I know it's not in what I studied but it's in this word today amen because that word is my absolute right praise the Lord but David you know he grew and uh they they told him said you know the one that kills this giant gets to marry the King's Daughter and you know how David's life progressed he ended up marrying the King's Daughter becoming best friends with the King's son and whatever and things were going real well there was nothing to be said everything was going fine but let me tell you something I don't know about your life but when things start going good the devil shows up because he doesn't want your life to have any peace he wants to come he wants to money the waters he wants to trouble the waters he wants to disrupt the unity that you have between you and God Amen now I know this that he cannot destroy the plan of God for my life right amen but he can come and he can muddy the waters he can trouble the waters some people say that when when uh Eve failed in the Garden of Eden that that the devil destroyed the pl man of God no he just interrupted it he just he just uh uhh send it a different direction and let me tell you God was not surprised at what happened in the garden of Ed amen right he was not surprised because he had already before the foundation of the world slew a lamb Amen to remedy what was taking place back there amen amen yes but here was David you know and and uh uh you would think that he never had any problems You' think that may your pastor never has any problems hello welcome to our world yeah amen you would think that you know David didn't have any problems but evidently he did because here the scripture said amen here oh Lord amen attend to my prayer from the ends of the Earth when I cry into thee when my heart is overwhelmed right now I know nobody here has those kind of problems the devil doesn't give you this is Arizona you don't have the problems like we have in North Carolina but let me tell of the devil is Alive and Well back in the East yes amen he has not he has not let up one bit but David said I am overwhelmed you know what that word overwhelmed means that means totally destroyed just about totally brought up down wow and he was a man that oh he he sung he went out he he slew Bears he slew Lions amen he slew Giants and here he is at his very lowest moment said Lord I'm overwhelmed with yes I don't know about you but I've been there yes I've been there I've been to the place that I felt like I was totally overwhelmed that there was no way out of this battle there was no way out of this problem there was no way out of this trouble for me but God always makes the way Hallelujah I got news for you before there was a problem there was an answer before there was a sickness there was a Healer before you ever got in trouble God made a way for you to get out of trouble hallelujah amen that's the kind of God he is the amen but David said I'm overwhelmed amen but we read the scripture in Psalms 31 he said Thou Art my rock yes amen the thing I love about a rock that it's secure amen it doesn't just wishy-washy amen amen the only thing that can change a Rock Amen is a constant force of water the only thing can change a rock is a constant force amen of the spirit of God moving amen and I tell you what I want that constant force of the spirit of God moving every day if there's anything in our lives that we don't need that we don't we we shouldn't have then we need the spirit of God just to come and to purchase every day amen amen yes David said when I'm overwhelmed lead me to that rock right if I can get to the Rock if I can get to that place at the very lowest moment amen when he was feeling all the pressure and and like you said brother I don't guess we have to title these messages but if we put a title on we just call it living under the pressure amen because as as we get closer to the coming of the Lord you believe he's coming oh yeah yes sir amen amen I've heard it all my life but I believe he's he's closer now than he ever has been amen but the closer we get to the coming of the Lord and the enemy amen sees his time being shortened amen every day that goes by his time is being shortened he launches a greater and a stronger war against each and every I'm going through things today Amen in my life that I never thought I would go through before amen you know when I I was raised in a Pentecostal trinitarian church and and and and evolved into a a Wess Pentecostal church and then evolved into this that's the evolution I went through amen but one day God revealed a message to me yes amen and I I reached that state of perfection in the word amen Lord but you know at his very moment at the very lowest moment when he was feeling all this pressure amen and you know we're living in now some people live a lifetime and never see but maybe one or two prophecies amen come about yeah you and I are living in an hour in a moment when we're seeing prophecy being fulfilled every single day we're seeing the word of God spoken in uh the word spoken in the written word we''re seeing the word spoken by the prophet we're see in events of the hour transpiring every day that tell us that the coming of the Lord is not at hand yes I believe that amen amen but we live though no people some people have only seen one or two but you and I are living in the hour when we're seing it happen each and every day praise the Lord but you know what happens when prophecy begins to be fulfilled it brings pressure amen amen when prophecy begins to be fulfilled when we seeing the word of God coming to pass and all these other things that are happened amen it stirs hell yes excuse me but it just stirs hell devil gets mad yes amen he he realized is his time is short amen right but when that word begins to fulfill be fulfilled amen we see all the things of God and you know in the days of prophecy about Jesus there were wonderful Zachariah and Isaiah amen and all these words that went forth concerning the Lord the promise was real but the pressure amen begin to mount yes amen and this it's the same way today that pressure begins to mount each and every day every time God brings about a promise amen a little more pressure the devil puts a little more pressure on you to believe what God said come on yes puts a little more pressure on you to believe what God Said Amen because if he can get you to disbelieve you know the devil doesn't care if you go to church right amen just F he doesn't care if you go to church amen but if he can get you to disbelieve one word of this scripture that's all that Eve done was disbelieve one word amen amen but what if how can it be I tell you how it can be just like Mary said the Holy Ghost will do it amen when I can't do it the Holy Ghost will do it when I can't overcome the Holy Ghost living in me amen uh uh and that's the way it is I'm not an overcomer right Amen in myself but with him in me I am overcome Revelation said to him that overcometh will I grant to sit on the throne with me as I have overcome and sit on the throne with my father prise the Lord I've got a position guaranteed amen amen yes sir when we see that prophecy being fulfilled amen it only make us happy and we are yes amen we are happy about it amen because listen Church a lot of times you look and you say well everything's wrong amen but when everything's wrong everything is right yes because when everything's wrong we see amen God bringing everything into fulfillment right right amen but when we see this happening Along Comes the pressure we you know brother Brown said there's coming a squeeze right hello let me announce amen we have been pressured yes you know I was reading foxy book of Martyrs the last couple days in fact I had it on the plane with been reading uh the last few pages of it when I come up and I thought about you know the the people that the that the enemy destroyed literally physically amen and some of the things that you read in that in that book at what the Believers went through and how they gave their lives physically amen but you know what the enemy found out he could not he could not annihilate the church physically right amen so he came about with a with a new plan amen and it's called deceit it's called uh it's called getting people amen to be at ease and Zion it's called a a spirit so near like the original that it would deceive the very elect amen you know the enemy comes to us in three different ways he came as a as a subtle serpent to the to even the Garden of Eden amen he came as a roaring line amen destroying the physical life of many Believers amen through the Dark Ages but here he is in this hour amen presenting himself as an angel of light come on right to tell you this is all right and that's all right and it's it's it doesn't mean this and God didn't mean that but listen when God said it he meant it yes am we see this prophecy fulfilled in the pressure that's coming on you know there there's a war going on over in Israel MH yes sir amen people are dying every day yes and you know what it's doing that that pressure amen that war is fulfillment of God's word yes amen because listen the world as a majority hates Israel sure especially those countries in the in the Middle East there whatever they hate Israel and as that as that word Goes Forth and that prophecy Goes Forth amen and those Wars transpire amen it is it is fulfilling the word of God but it's bringing more pressure on you and I on the bride of Christ I told the little church back home I said listen the wars in Israel the war against Israel those people will never defeat Israel amen but what they will do they will quickly usher in the coming of the Lord lord it's going to make the coming of the Lord amen just moving in faster and faster and quicker and quicker prise the Lord amen it's bringing us closer to that yes you say well I can't see that well you know if you look over in Exodus amen when when Israel was down in Egypt's land amen and they were they were slaves under the the Egyptians and they were making more bricks out of mortar and straw and whatever but they lived in that place expecting the promise of God that I'll send a deliverer yes amen amen well when they began when when when the when the the the reputation you might say of Moses when when they begin to recognize that something was happening here was Moses amen taken out of the Nile River raised in the Palace of pharaoh amen 40 years and then killed in Egyptian god drove him into the Wilderness yes to get all of Egypt out of him amen amen so time it may take 40 years to get everything out of you but that's what it takes amen but the but one day brother Newton a a rumor got stirred God's going to God's about to send a deliverer amen amen let me tell you something it's more than a rumor today right amen God's fixing the S amen he sent a voice in this hour he's fixed to send his son to to Rapture our church away it's not a rumor anymore there's truth in it somebody say Amen truth in it but here was Egypt in Israel in Egypt and and they were making straw of bricks and out of mud and straw and whatever and and the the rumor got about and the word began to spread that God was going to send that deliverer it was it was almost ready God was almost on the verge of send and what happened was that when this word began to come and this word begin to fulfill I'll send my deliverer and bring you out 400 years is they had been there right amen but when God started to smooth and that that deliverer started to come Pharaoh looked at the Egyptians said well now at the Israelites amen now we're going to take away your straw yeah amen as this prophecy began to fulfill that I'll send a deliverer it brought more pressure on the people of God that were in Israel now we're going to take away your straw you got to go get your own straw yeah amen you got to do this and not only that you've got to make a 100 bricks an hour instead of 50 bricks an hour amen so as as God began to fulfill his word the pressure began to come on the people of God yes amen it be we you know what's wrong with the church the world today as a whole we become desensitized amen if it feels good do it amen it doesn't matter if some uh if the church says it's wrong or if the word says it's wrong if it feels good do it yeah amen we don't want to get in V come on brother we're desensitized to sin you know yes uh true sometime you know you get watching the movie I tell told a little church back home I said you know you you try to watch a movie or something and they stick in a a profanity or whatever it goes over and amen after a while you get where you become deaf to it yeah but you should never become deaf to it amen it's not part of your character right amen it should never be part of your life true Amen on your job sometime the Bost man may want to come along and kind of tell a dirty joke and well you're just kind of I hear him but I don't hear him amen we're becoming desensitized right I don't want to hear it amen stop right there devil you've gone far enough this this is the end stop right there amen yeah but these things affect the bride of Christ you know we're we're we're not the world but we're in this world and these things have an effect on us that's right amen the politics and the things that are going on in the world you know brother Brown said back in 1965 he said the world is groping in Insanity yes can you imagine what he would say today right have you looked around church I read an article just the other day brother where a woman killed her baby and then she called 911 not because she had killed her baby but because she had cut her herself while she was killing the baby these are people we work with and we live around and we work see go to Walmart with yeah amen talk about Insanity what is going on now amen if the prophet said in 65 amen the world is gr with Insanity what in the world Amen are we experiencing noways yes right amen amen the pressure that's coming but let me tell you something greater is he that's in you amen than he that's in the world Hallelujah we are overcome I believe that with all my heart we are Overcomers as long as we stay within the boundaries of God's word amen we'll never get in trouble we'll never get outside the plan of God when God drew a circle in the in the Garden of Eden when the only reason that Eve got in trouble she stepped over the boundary of what God Said Yes right amen amen I'm not trying to see how close to the world I can live right I'm trying to see how far away from it I can live amen amen some women are trying to see how short they can get the skirt and not get preached on yeah oh I didn't mean to say that that's that's Pastor stuff amen amen but they're trying to see how short they get destruction not a not get a a a preached on or trim the little ends off of the hair not get preached on or brothers let theirs get a little bit longer and a little bit longer and longer and not get preached on come on amen amen all this pressures coming upon us to try amen just to he s us to the word of God that's right amen the whole fabric Church the whole fabric of our society is falling apart but you know John said we have peace amen amen we have peace with him than Lord I believe that yes Satan's about to have his hey dayjah amen but the church is about to have hers also all those 2,000 plus Demons of Hitler they're not dead they just been waiting for the opportunity amen amen yes sir that's right the national Security Council just recently charged Israel with with war crimes and you know why they charged with war crimes because 4,396 missiles have been fired from from Syria and these these goding uh countries on Israel and Israel retaliated right so by Israel retaliating they were charged with war crimes yeah amen tell me the world is not against everything that is of god right tell me the world is not everything that is like God amen amen tell me that the world is not like is not against everything that wants to manifest God that's the truth amen yes and you know that same spirit that is Waring against Israel even today it's the same spirit that is Waring against you amen amen but let me tell you something God made a promise to Israel and he made a promise to you amen that you'll not be overcome that you're a Victorious that the battle's already won amen the victory is already yours praise the Lord glory to God I believe that yes amen amen true I said a little bit ago sometime we we think that everything is wrong but when everything is wrong it's really everything is right because what we see we see that the plan of God is coming about in this hour it may look wrong to us but what it is is a fulfillment of the word of God Amen yes sir you look at politics and and I I'm not not in into politics but when you look at them you think you know how how in the world can can the the country even survive right amen but these things affect us I don't know about you but things have been rough the last couple of years right am my son told me the other day he said he said dad he said I I I can't even hard to making enough money to buy groceries he said prices have gone so high brother uh was just telling about a brother that bought a a a motor home and and from one day he bought it the next day it went up $20,000 amen amen yes look around church this what's happening to us amen we're in the worst struggles we've been in for years and years and years yes truth but John said amen peace I leave with you yes my peace I give unto you thank you Lord when I'm overwhelmed there's a refuge yes there's a there's a hiding place there's a rock that I can run on to Lord amen we had to fight to get to where we are in God I got a secret you're going to have to fight to stay where you are amen amen because you can't stand still you're going to have to persevere day after day after day after day the very moment that God comes and touches your body and heals you the next day the devil come with something else against you amen amen the very moment that God blesses you a little bit financially the car breaks down come on Church am I tell you the truth amen the pressure that we're living under amen but there is a refuge there is a promise amen I'll run to the Rock You said brother Johnny The Rock won't fix my car but God will yes amen God Will Make A Way yes amen whe there seems to be no way God Will Make A Way amen yes sir time would not permit for all of us to stand and testify how God has done something miraculous in our life yes sir amen it may not seem miraculous to you but if God does it it's miraculous amen amen we had to fight to get where we are we had to fight Amen to maintain it when when Joshua was leading the children of Israel amen he said every step every place that the so of be feat shall touch amen that's ground you're a possessing every step you take amen you're possessing ground stepping Is possessing church amen and the closer more you walk with God the more you possess the promise of God the word of God the the the the move of God everything that God has the closer and the more you walk with him the more it becomes real to you yes amen amen right I'll tell you what I don't know about you but if devil if the devil's going to fight let's fight come on Amen bring it on you might say Amen now now I'm no match for you you know when when Daniel Prayed the scripture said he prayed for 21 days and the answer didn't come right y I wonder how many of us would have continued to pray 21 days God help us amen don't raise your hand right amen but I wonder how many of us would have give up after a day and a half or two days well it ain't God's will yeah amen if it concerns you you it concerns God amen amen but you know what I love brother Newton when the angel of God got there amen he said I heard you the very first day yes he said but I was hindered amen you mean the angel of God was hindered yes sir he said and I went back and got reinforcements yes amen don't give up Church hallelujah amen don't ever give up amen I heard brother Dan da say one time you should never give up until you waited 25 years he said because Abraham waited 25 years for the promise of a son and you you're you're less than Abraham if you give up before 25 years amen amen but let me tell you something God God's got the answer for us today yes amen praise Lord but if the devil wants to fight he's got a fight on his hand amen amen now not not that I possess anything but my big brother's got all the all the instruments hallelujah amen he's got all the resources if you want to if you want to see what God can do just look into his Arsenal amen and to see what he has amen he can fight your battles for you amen amen yes you want to make it hard on me devil I'm going to make it hard on you yes amen I'm going to bring the word am the next time you come I'm not going to come

picked up five smooth Stones amen I've heard preachers preach and say those five stones meant faith f AI t h they meant Jesus j s u s I tell you what they meant to me they meant death d e a t h they meant death to that giant amen amen you know he could have picked up a boulder he could have picked up rough rocks he could have picked up a stone with all Jagged egg but he picked up a smooth Stone yeah amen and it just it just went right in that forehead of that giant without any problem amen amen prise you know you would think that most of if if if you hit the Giant in the forehead he's going to fall backwards but the scripture said he fell forward amen right at David's feet amen see the devil will bring you bring God will bring the devil to to to to uh uh overcome amen right at your feet he'll bring the battle right and he'll have to face you right at your feet amen amen praise the Lord yes make it hard devil we're going to make it hard yes amen praise the Lord he doesn't belong on your shoulder right it doesn't belong sitting on the Pew Next To You Right amen it's time that the bride of Christ and and you know I've heard preachers say this I probably said it myself that that the bride's living below her potential right well a few months ago I was ministering to little church back home and I that thought came to my the bride is living and then I asked a question brother Newton why why is she living below potential we've got the greatest message we've got the greatest truth we're living in the greatest hour that the church has ever lived you L to see yes sir because God has revealed the fullness of his word to us in this hour the greatest time that we can ever experience that's what we're living in amen so why should the bride be living below her potential that's the truth but I tell you where the devil belongs he belongs under your feet yes if he's not under your feet he's out of his place Hallelujah I give you a little little secet when you go home today get your black Magic Marker and write I have no balance in this here right right on the bottom of your foot right in here where it won't won't get rubbed off right Satan this is your place yeah under my

to destroy everything that there is about God right about the devil amen amen yes I tell you what one day one day we're going to we're going to we're going to go home yes amen and I can imagine Peter

the world did you ever make it out of that god-hating naked wretched blind how did you ever make it out of that age right amen amen God brought me through yes the Holy Ghost I'm sure many of you probably have seen on the internet there's a there's a preacher whose name is Al aliser bigs and he said when he gets to Heaven I want to I want to meet beat the thief that was on the cross he says cuz I want to ask him how did this work out for you he said because can you imagine when that Thief got to Heaven kind of paraphrase a little bit and the angel said how did you get here I don't know

everything I've done there's been times when I when I have fallen on my face and asked God why do you even care why would you even do this why why why why why and the only thing I can hear him say because I love you right because I love you amen amen ain't nothing will change the love of God lord there ain't nothing you can do if your sons and daughters are there ain't nothing you can do that will change the love of God Amen that's right I believe that with all my heart that's the truth amen Psalms 143 D David said for the enemy ha persecuted my soul he has smitten my life down to the ground boy that's low that's about as low as you can get David just Walling right in the ground he said he had made me to dwell in darkness as those that have long been dead and was David just said

heard the story of the eagle amen how that every seven years he has to go through this this this change amen his feathers get matted up and his beak gets all over with Calum and his his talents get all covered over with Calum and he he can't he can't move and and fly the way he want to and you know what he does he goes down to the valley yeah amen thank God don't ever don't ever fret about a valley right amen because he is the lily of the valley amen amen he come out smelling good yes but he goes down to the valley and he gets up on a rock and he starts beating that old beak against that rock until he breaks that beak completely off yeah and he has to sit there for another one to grow and it beats those tons and then all the calcium is beat off of them and pull those old matted feathers amen out of his out of his wings and out of his body and every how long it takes and I don't I I don't I say Lord I don't care how long it takes just just be there with me amen as long as you're with me I don't care how long it takes but the thing I love about that story of the eagle yeah he gets a new beak and new Talons and new wings but then he gets he gets up on that rock and he just sits there and he kind of bounces a little bit like this and he spreads those wings out amen and he just sits there what are you waiting on why don't you flap your wings why don't you fly I'm waiting yes they that wait upon the Lord shall re their strength they'll Mount up with wings as Eagles they'll run and not grow weary they'll walk and not faint that rock and he just sits there yes those wings spread out you know what is waiting on he's waiting on that wind to come over that mountain and down through that Valley when that wind comes over that mountain and down through that Valley he just sets those wings yes if you've ever watched an eagle up close and I I'm just I'm just fascinated by them how that they their their wings are so big how that they their wings actually Bend IN in two sections so that they can get them close to their body they're so big but he'll set those wings and he'll just sett him at the right angle and when that wind comes it just picks him up
