[43:19] word God to accomplish that that you had

[43:31] people God so Lord we're just committed

[43:47] all that is said and done here in this

[44:06] and amongst us your people God so let it
[44:09] be we commit it to you now in the name
[44:11] of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen
[44:15] amen Deuteronomy chapter 11.
[44:20] um we're going to begin reading with
[44:21] verse 26.
[44:23] Deuteronomy 11 26 behold I set before
[44:27] you this day a blessing and a curse
[44:30] a blessing if you obey the Commandments
[44:33] of the Lord your God which I command you
[44:35] this day and a curse if you will not
[44:38] obey the Commandments of the Lord your
[44:40] God but turn aside out of the way which
[44:43] I command you this day to go after other
[44:45] gods which ye have not known and it
[44:48] shall come to pass when the Lord thy God
[44:50] hath brought thee in unto the land
[44:52] whether thou go was to possess it that
[44:54] thou shalt put the blessing upon Mount
[44:57] Gerson and the curse upon Mount evil are
[45:01] they not on the other side Jordan by the
[45:03] way where the sun goes down in the land
[45:05] of the Canaanites which uh which dwell
[45:08] in the champagne over against gilgal
[45:10] beside the plains of Mora for ye shall
[45:13] pass over Jordan to go in to possess the
[45:16] land which the Lord your God giveth you
[45:18] and ye shall possess it and dwell
[45:21] therein and ye shall observe to do all
[45:24] the statutes and judgments which I set
[45:27] before you this day you could be seated
[45:30] if you'd like
[45:33] amen
[45:36] this is a a warning this is a uh an
[45:39] exhortation obviously that was given to
[45:42] the children of Israel that Moses
[45:44] escaped to the children of Israel they
[45:46] gave them a choice
[45:47] as every one of us are free moral agents
[45:50] every one of us have Choice everyone can
[45:53] go the way we want to go we can do the
[45:55] things we want to do we can live however
[45:57] we want to live we can make the choices
[45:59] we want to make but the but as
[46:02] Christians as the these children of God
[46:06] here uh the the word was set before them
[46:11] yes you have the choice but if you
[46:14] choose to obey God's word you will be
[46:17] blessed if you choose to go against
[46:20] God's word or not obey God's word then
[46:23] you will be cursed and that's pretty
[46:26] much the black and white of it uh as
[46:28] humans we always try to find gray areas
[46:31] we always try to find intermingled areas
[46:34] where we think well would God be okay
[46:36] with this and would this be something
[46:38] that I could get away with or is this
[46:41] something that uh that would be pleasing
[46:43] or displeasing to the Lord or something
[46:45] that we always try to find a gray area
[46:47] to work within but really when it comes
[46:50] right down to it the bottom line is if
[46:52] we obey God in God's word God blesses us
[46:55] if we come against God's word and we
[46:57] don't obey God's word we are living
[46:59] under curse and that's just the only two
[47:01] ways of it so as three moral agents we
[47:04] had that choice the whole world has that
[47:06] choice not just as Christians but
[47:08] everybody has Choice every day in
[47:10] whatever they decide to do in their free
[47:12] moral agencies Adam and Eve had choice
[47:15] they had to choose when when and the
[47:19] serpent came to Eve Eve had a choice
[47:21] what was she going to decide to do and
[47:23] she chose to disobey God's word and what
[47:26] did it do it brought curse Adam had that
[47:29] choice when it was presented to Adam
[47:31] Adam could have chose one way or the
[47:34] other whether he would accept or he
[47:36] would reject and he rejected and
[47:38] disobeyed God's word and what did it do
[47:41] it brought Curse God himself said if you
[47:44] are disobey this word then that that day
[47:48] that you do that that's the day you die
[47:51] amen well what is that uh that's nothing
[47:54] more than than living under hearse uh we
[47:59] oftentimes try to think uh if we enter
[48:02] into God's permissive will uh if I do
[48:06] this or or I disobey God here am I going
[48:09] to enter into God's permissive will and
[48:11] live in God's permissive will and I'll
[48:13] be okay in God's permissive will friend
[48:15] as you've heard me say over and over
[48:17] again living in God's permissive will in
[48:20] my opinion is failure am I we are not to
[48:23] live in God's permissive will we
[48:25] shouldn't go and God's permissible it's
[48:27] like well if I do this then God will
[48:30] forgive me obedience is what God looks
[48:32] for yes and obedience in Choice God's
[48:35] not looking for obedience in force he
[48:39] doesn't want to make us obey the word he
[48:42] wants us to do it by our free will he
[48:45] wants us to choose to obey his word
[48:47] because we want to because it's in our
[48:51] hearts to do it because it's the desire
[48:54] of our heart to do it not because he
[48:56] makes us do it but because we want to do
[48:58] it so the choice we have is based on not
[49:02] just our free will but the fact that God
[49:04] wants us to choose him over everything
[49:06] else God wants us to choose to obey the
[49:09] word he wants us to do that he doesn't
[49:12] want us to disobey the word and you see
[49:15] Disobedience at his was laid out here
[49:18] you see what he calls Disobedience a
[49:21] curse if you will not obey the
[49:23] Commandments of the Lord your God but
[49:25] turn aside out of the way which I
[49:27] command you this day to go after other
[49:29] gods
[49:30] so Disobedience was considered going
[49:34] after other gods right
[49:37] Disobedience to God's word is considered
[49:40] going now what would that other God be
[49:42] well it could be you
[49:45] you could be your own God right and you
[49:47] know that's like the popular thing in
[49:49] the in the world today it's a popular
[49:51] thing in this country and and people and
[49:53] people who profess to be Christians and
[49:56] even some ministers about her to come
[49:58] out say you you're you are your own God
[50:03] amen well if you are your own God then
[50:06] you created yourself
[50:08] you're the one that keeps your blood
[50:11] pumping and your heart going in and your
[50:13] mind operating well if that's the case
[50:15] then we would live forever because who
[50:18] is going to command as your own God your
[50:21] heart to stop beating or your mind to
[50:24] quit working or for you to get cancer or
[50:27] some kind of disease
[50:29] hey if you're your own God you say okay
[50:31] uh then I'm Healed
[50:35] amen no reason to go to the hospital I'm
[50:37] Healed
[50:39] well we can profess that but we profess
[50:41] that based on the fact that we know he's
[50:43] the one that heals us we profess our
[50:46] healing because our God heals us not
[50:49] that I am our own God but you become
[50:51] your own God if you decide to go your
[50:53] own way
[50:54] well I want to live by my own opinions
[50:56] well then you've become your own god
[50:57] well I want to live the way I want to go
[51:00] I want to do the things I want to do
[51:02] then you are your own God
[51:04] you have become your own God you've gone
[51:07] after other gods and that God is the one
[51:09] looking back at you in your mirror
[51:12] because you've decided to do it your way
[51:14] oh surely God will understand
[51:18] maybe he will he's an understanding God
[51:21] he's the god of mercy and Grace but I'm
[51:24] just telling you today and reading the
[51:26] Bible if we obey if we disobey God's
[51:28] word we're living under hers right amen
[51:31] if we don't follow what God's word
[51:33] commands for us to do then we're living
[51:35] under curse
[51:37] look what brother Braham said a couple
[51:39] of uh notes on
[51:41] on the on this choice and there's three
[51:45] more agency choosing of a bride 1965
[51:48] brother Graham says now choosing abroad
[51:50] in many things of light we are given a
[51:53] choice
[51:54] the way of life itself is a choice
[51:58] amen
[52:00] we have a right to make our own way
[52:02] choose our own way that we want to live
[52:04] yes we do
[52:06] education is a choice we can choose
[52:08] whether we are going to be educated
[52:10] whether we're not going to be educated
[52:12] that's a choice we have the choice of
[52:15] right and wrong
[52:16] right or wrong is set before us the
[52:19] scripture God his word
[52:21] gives us shows right or wrong we have
[52:24] that choice
[52:25] everybody has that choice every man
[52:27] every woman boy girl has to choose
[52:30] whether they are going to live right or
[52:32] not live right
[52:34] it's a choice choice is a great thing
[52:36] your Eternal destination
[52:40] now here we go we're not talking about
[52:42] just living under blessings or cursings
[52:44] anymore your
[52:46] Eternal destination is a choice
[52:50] did you realize that
[52:52] you realize your Eternal destination is
[52:55] a choice
[52:56] amen it comes with a part of the
[52:59] blessings or a part of the cursing
[53:02] the blessings are you go to heaven to
[53:05] live with him eternally
[53:07] the cursings are you go to hell
[53:11] that's the that's the two choices
[53:13] your Eternal destination it's a choice
[53:16] and maybe tonight some of you will make
[53:18] that choice whether where you will spend
[53:21] eternity before the service is tonight
[53:23] if you turn God down many times there'll
[53:26] be one time you'll turn him down for the
[53:29] last time
[53:30] there is a line between mercy and
[53:33] judgment and it's a dangerous thing for
[53:36] a man or a woman boy or a girl to step
[53:38] across that line
[53:40] there for there is no return when you
[53:43] step across that deadline so tonight it
[53:46] must be the time that you make the
[53:48] decision the decision to choose life
[53:51] the decision to choose Christ amen
[53:55] obviously brother Branham in a more
[53:57] mixed congregation audience than we have
[54:00] here this morning but yet the but yet
[54:02] the the words still are true
[54:05] amen amen the words are still true
[54:08] we still have that choice yes amen many
[54:11] of us have made that choice long ago and
[54:14] our and our choice determination is that
[54:17] we want to be with him we want to go in
[54:19] a Rapture and spend eternity with him
[54:21] we've made that choice that's our
[54:24] determination amen
[54:26] [Music]
[54:29] now the breach message
[54:32] he says now of course when Adam fell to
[54:34] death he brought death upon all creation
[54:37] when he chose to disobey he brought
[54:41] death upon all creation
[54:43] remember that Chasm was thrown between
[54:46] him and God
[54:48] now he was given free moral agency and
[54:50] was given to them just as we have today
[54:53] to make a choice Adam and Eve in the
[54:56] beginning there was a tree of right and
[54:58] wrong uh before them and that same tree
[55:01] that same tree says before each and
[55:05] every one of us today
[55:09] see God isn't doing it for Adam and Eve
[55:11] say well it's their fault not now it
[55:13] isn't but van says no not now it is your
[55:17] fault you can't place that on Adam now
[55:20] you've got to place it on yourself
[55:22] because right or wrong is set before you
[55:24] today
[55:26] amen set before us we're on the same
[55:29] basis Adam and Eve free moral agency but
[55:32] you see when we are redeemed we no more
[55:35] want our own choice
[55:37] praise God now we're getting somewhere
[55:39] when we are redeemed that we no more
[55:41] want our own choice we look at the word
[55:44] and we say Okay God I see in your word
[55:46] is so and so such and such then Lord
[55:48] according to your will according to your
[55:52] word what did we just see Have Thine Own
[55:55] Way Lord amen amen whatever it costs me
[55:59] wherever it takes me whatever it means
[56:02] in my life Lord I want your will yes
[56:05] amen I want your will whatever it does
[56:09] but we want his choice seed now Adam and
[56:12] Eve wanted their own choice they wanted
[56:14] to find out what it was to have wisdom
[56:16] so forth like that now one more
[56:18] leadership sometimes in life we have to
[56:22] confront the thing like this young man
[56:24] did because you are a moral being
[56:28] you are given uh a choice you are given
[56:31] the opportunity of choice you have
[56:34] Choice God made it so you can choose
[56:38] if uh if he'd put Adam and Eve on free
[56:41] moral agency so they could choose and
[56:44] then they made the wrong choice
[56:46] and um now he's he says see uh he can do
[56:51] no more to you than what he did to them
[56:54] he put them on the same thing so you can
[56:57] choose or reject because it's our choice
[57:00] our decision now Moses put before them
[57:03] of The Obedience of the word now that
[57:08] that's really the whole point I want to
[57:11] get to today is The Obedience of the
[57:14] word and obey the word
[57:17] what is it that comes
[57:19] and and our lives and our lives are
[57:22] lived when we obey God in his word
[57:28] now we know because we've all lived
[57:30] there
[57:31] we've all been there we know what it is
[57:33] when we obey God we obey his word
[57:36] we've seen it happen we've seen the
[57:38] results we know what it does when God uh
[57:41] when we obey God's word
[57:43] and that obedience brings us more into
[57:47] contact with the Lord Jesus and that's
[57:50] all that we're that that's our whole
[57:51] point of life is to grow closer to the
[57:54] Lord when we were born we were born in
[57:57] sin shaped iniquity to come the world
[57:59] speaking lives we couldn't be any
[58:00] further from God
[58:02] then that then was possible but as life
[58:05] goes on and as we choose and our choice
[58:08] is for him our whole point is to grow
[58:10] closer to him how do we grow closer to
[58:13] him how do we become more like him well
[58:16] he's the word
[58:18] so how do we become more like him we've
[58:20] got to become more like the word
[58:23] well how do we become more like the word
[58:25] by obeying the word
[58:27] by living the word yes we've been
[58:30] speaking about this over the past couple
[58:32] of services and the Lord put something
[58:34] on my heart that that I want to talk
[58:36] about going forward after today but it
[58:39] all hinges on this
[58:41] and Disobedience and and this obedience
[58:44] to the word becoming the word living the
[58:47] word letting that word permeate through
[58:50] you because you are the living
[58:52] embodiment of Jesus Christ on this Earth
[58:55] today
[58:56] and the only way you can be that the
[58:58] only way you can project that is by
[59:01] living and obeying the word
[59:03] amen it's the only way we can do it is
[59:06] by living and obeying that word
[59:08] now let's look at uh the 28th of the
[59:12] 28th chapter Deuteronomy still the 28th
[59:16] chapter
[59:26] amen Deuteronomy 28
[59:31] if blessing and cursing was laid before
[59:33] them today or back then
[59:36] that same blessing and cursing is laid
[59:38] before us today yes
[59:40] hinges on The Obedience of God's word
[59:44] uh
[59:46] you can look at even uh let's just look
[59:50] even at brother Brown
[59:52] what happened to brother random when he
[59:54] disobeyed God's word yeah
[59:57] now this was an extreme situation
[1:00:00] because of an extreme individual a gift
[1:00:08] when brother random disobeyed God what
[1:00:12] did God do
[1:00:13] God took his wife and his little girl
[1:00:16] amen
[1:00:18] when brother random stood there and he
[1:00:20] tried to pray for his little girl a
[1:00:22] black sheep fell in front
[1:00:25] I'm not listening
[1:00:27] the Devil comes up and says Seether I
[1:00:29] told you he didn't care about you
[1:00:32] amen the result of Disobedience see I
[1:00:36] told you he didn't care about you he's
[1:00:39] not even listening to you he's not even
[1:00:41] listening to your prayer your little
[1:00:43] girl's as good as dead I'm paraphrasing
[1:00:45] of course
[1:00:46] amen she's not going to live God's not
[1:00:48] even listening to you
[1:00:51] well Sharon Rose he did
[1:00:55] and brother Branham came to the place to
[1:00:57] recognize what happened I think about
[1:01:00] the time that brother Branham uh they he
[1:01:03] had the managers and all
[1:01:05] you know I I think we all kind of hold
[1:01:08] brother random in a certain esteem but
[1:01:11] we got to understand brother Brown was a
[1:01:12] man yeah
[1:01:13] amen he was a man he was Flesh and Blood
[1:01:15] just like you and I he had decisions to
[1:01:18] make just like me and you right amen
[1:01:21] he lied to that rhs he had his daughter
[1:01:24] a lot of the IRS agent tell him I'm not
[1:01:27] here
[1:01:28] ran out the door
[1:01:30] see trying to find that gray area
[1:01:33] oh God will be okay with this I'll just
[1:01:36] run outside that way I'm really not here
[1:01:39] see we're all humans we're always trying
[1:01:42] to find that little way of trying to see
[1:01:45] his God good he'll be okay with this
[1:01:47] just tell me and he got his own daughter
[1:01:48] to lie for it
[1:01:51] and what happened he goes to pray for
[1:01:54] this little sick girl and God says take
[1:01:56] your hands off of her you're not fit to
[1:01:58] pray for her
[1:02:02] amen God help us amen what helped what
[1:02:06] happened when he went overseas I forgot
[1:02:08] where it was uh Africa Maybe
[1:02:11] and he had these he had these men that
[1:02:14] were uh his campaign managers and such
[1:02:17] they had all this stuff lined up and
[1:02:18] brother Brandon you got to go here this
[1:02:20] is where we got you set up this is where
[1:02:22] the
[1:02:23] forgive me but the people are the money
[1:02:26] is you got to go over here this is where
[1:02:28] we got it and God spoke to brother Brown

[1:06:26] increase of thy kind and flocks of thy
[1:06:29] sheep
[1:06:30] blessed shall be thy basket and thy
[1:06:33] store blessed shalt thou be when thou
[1:06:36] comest in and blessed thou be when thou
[1:06:38] goest out
[1:06:40] the Lord shall call thine enemies to
[1:06:43] rise up against thee to be smitten
[1:06:46] before thy face
[1:06:48] praise the Lord that means god fights my
[1:06:51] battles amen amen God's the one that
[1:06:54] takes care of it
[1:06:56] they shall come uh they shall come out
[1:06:59] against thee one way
[1:07:00] flee before the seven ways
[1:07:04] that just means you're in a hurry to get
[1:07:05] out of your presence
[1:07:07] amen that just means you're in a hurry
[1:07:10] to get out
[1:07:11] they're not lined up they're getting out
[1:07:13] as quick as they can and the Lord shall
[1:07:16] command the blessing upon thee in thy
[1:07:18] storehouses and in all amen
[1:07:22] all that thou setest thine hand unto
[1:07:26] and he will bless thee in the land which
[1:07:29] the Lord thy God giveth thee
[1:07:31] amen your land is just your inheritance
[1:07:35] it doesn't mean a piece of dirt it means
[1:07:37] your inheritance
[1:07:39] it means your life
[1:07:41] it means that you not just your
[1:07:44] posterity but all that you put your hand
[1:07:47] to
[1:07:47] all that God as your blood of God all
[1:07:51] that God has blessed and given to you
[1:07:53] God will multiply and bless
[1:07:57] amen I mean what better thing could you
[1:08:00] ask for what other God out in here
[1:08:03] Muhammad and Buddha and all what other
[1:08:06] of those do this for their congregation
[1:08:10] for their followers for their believers
[1:08:13] amen I just say none of them oh there's
[1:08:17] plenty of people out in the world that
[1:08:18] are rich and have money and all these
[1:08:20] things but that's not the blessings that
[1:08:23] we're talking about
[1:08:24] amen
[1:08:25] sometimes it is finances sometimes it is
[1:08:28] Goods but the blessings of God goes so
[1:08:32] far beyond just the monetary things Amen
[1:08:35] in obeying God's word
[1:08:38] God brings obedience amen we in to our
[1:08:42] lives now let's go to the 15th verse
[1:08:46] but it shall come to pass if thou will
[1:08:49] not hearken unto the voice of the Lord
[1:08:51] thy God to observe to do all his
[1:08:53] Commandments and his statutes which I
[1:08:56] command thee this day that all these
[1:08:59] curses all these curses shall come upon
[1:09:01] thee and overtake thee again
[1:09:03] is the difference between being obedient
[1:09:06] and the blessings of God and disobedient
[1:09:09] and the curses of God
[1:09:12] curse shall thou be in the city and
[1:09:15] curse shall thou be in the field curse
[1:09:18] shall be thy basket on thy story curse
[1:09:20] shall be the fruit of thy body and the
[1:09:22] fruit of thy land and increase of thy
[1:09:24] kind and the flocks of thy sheep cursed
[1:09:28] shalt thou be when thou comeest in and
[1:09:30] cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out
[1:09:34] the Lord shall send upon thee cursing
[1:09:37] vexation and rebuke in all that thou
[1:09:41] setest thine hand unto for to do until
[1:09:45] thou be destroyed and until thou perish
[1:09:48] quickly because of the wickedness of thy
[1:09:50] doings whereby thou has forsaken me
[1:09:54] the Lord shall make the pestilence
[1:09:56] cleave unto thee until he have consumed
[1:10:00] thee from off the land whether thou
[1:10:02] goest to possess it now those are some
[1:10:04] pretty severe curses Saints
[1:10:06] those are some pretty tough curses to to
[1:10:09] live under that that people live under
[1:10:13] those curses
[1:10:16] but look at the blessings that God gives
[1:10:18] let's go over to in Deuteronomy still
[1:10:21] the 29th chapter
[1:10:26] just some of the things that the Lord
[1:10:28] did for the children of Israel
[1:10:33] amen 29th chapter
[1:10:37] uh let's start with the first verse
[1:10:39] these are the words of the Covenant
[1:10:41] which the Lord commanded Moses to make
[1:10:44] with the children of Israel in the land
[1:10:45] of Moab beside the Covenant which he
[1:10:48] made with them in horrib
[1:10:51] and Israel called unto all Israel and
[1:10:53] Moses called unto all Israel and said
[1:10:56] unto them
[1:10:57] ye have seen all that the Lord did
[1:10:59] before your eyes in the land of Egypt
[1:11:02] unto pharaoh and unto all his servants
[1:11:05] and unto all his land why did he do that
[1:11:08] because of The Obedience of Moses now
[1:11:12] God heard the Cry of Israel and he
[1:11:15] promised to send a delivery said he
[1:11:17] would amen he prophesied it was in the
[1:11:20] scripture he said he would that the
[1:11:22] deliverer was coming but why did God do
[1:11:25] this because of The Obedience of one man
[1:11:29] because Moses decided that he would go
[1:11:32] down
[1:11:33] with a
[1:11:35] with a wife a baby and a stick in his
[1:11:38] hand to go take over the most powerful
[1:11:40] country in the world
[1:11:42] sometimes God asks us to do things and
[1:11:45] we say Lord I can't do it I'm incapable
[1:11:48] I'm not able to do this Lord I see in
[1:11:52] your word where it says that I'm
[1:11:54] supposed to do certain things but I
[1:11:57] can't do it go tell that to Moses
[1:12:00] oops amen go tell that to Moses
[1:12:04] one man with a stick in his hand to take
[1:12:07] over the most powerful country in the
[1:12:09] world
[1:12:10] could you imagine a person stepping off
[1:12:12] the boat in LA and coming in and people
[1:12:14] interviewing and looking and say well
[1:12:16] what are you doing here I'm going to
[1:12:17] take over this country
[1:12:19] oh you're just the nut hey put you in
[1:12:22] the funny farm and every time they
[1:12:23] touched you there's a curse something
[1:12:25] else happened
[1:12:26] amen finally get to the present the
[1:12:29] president said what are you doing here
[1:12:30] I'm here to take over oh that's he
[1:12:33] you're just crazy uh
[1:12:36] of course all that God did for Moses got
[1:12:38] him in the hollow Halls of pharaoh to
[1:12:40] begin with but you understand what I'm
[1:12:41] saying oh you'll you can never do this
[1:12:44] okay
[1:12:46] we'll find out
[1:12:47] that that day another curse oh that's
[1:12:51] just so and so that just happened in the
[1:12:53] next days another curse oh I'm not gonna
[1:12:56] obey that then fine
[1:12:58] finally
[1:13:00] he had to deliver God's people
[1:13:04] Moses did exactly what God said he would
[1:13:08] do
[1:13:09] because he obeyed God's word
[1:13:11] now I know Moses was hesitant at first
[1:13:14] and said oh I can't do this but God said
[1:13:16] I'll be with you I'll be with your mouth
[1:13:18] I'll take care of this I'll be with you
[1:13:20] I'll help you along the way
[1:13:22] and did he do it
[1:13:24] out of thin air God created
[1:13:27] fleezer
[1:13:29] bugs whatever the curse all the curses
[1:13:31] out of thin air blood into water add a
[1:13:35] thin air frogs everywhere out of thin
[1:13:37] air Locus everywhere he said God can't
[1:13:40] do this he is more than able amen and
[1:13:43] can do whatever it is that you have the
[1:13:45] name he said I can't do it yes you can
[1:13:48] he's got to believe
[1:13:50] you just gotta have faith and Obey and
[1:13:52] obedience and move on and move out on
[1:13:55] God's word Moses took over a whole
[1:13:57] country because he agreed to do that you
[1:14:00] see this
[1:14:01] because of this Moses called Israel
[1:14:06] back to the scripture now that the Lord
[1:14:08] did before your eyes in the land of
[1:14:10] pharaoh and uh Egypt unto Pharaoh unto
[1:14:13] all his servants and to all his land the
[1:14:15] great Temptations which thine eyes have
[1:14:18] seen the signs of those great Miracles
[1:14:20] yet the Lord hath not given you in heart
[1:14:23] to perceive ice to see and ears to hear
[1:14:25] unto this day
[1:14:26] I have led you these 40 years now they
[1:14:30] wouldn't go under the Candace The
[1:14:32] Showdown Acadia spartania they wouldn't
[1:14:34] go over and possess it Moses brought
[1:14:37] them to that place in obedience to God's
[1:14:39] word God blessed him in every way every
[1:14:43] time they turned around and when they
[1:14:45] come up to that place and they said over
[1:14:46] spies they said oh they're we're just we
[1:14:49] we can't do this we can't take it over
[1:14:51] and Joshua would come up and said we are
[1:14:53] more than Abel amen amen we are more
[1:14:56] than able but they listen to the others
[1:14:58] and it's oh we can't we can't go over
[1:15:00] there why because he looked at the
[1:15:01] circumstances
[1:15:03] amen don't let circumstances sway your
[1:15:06] your your decision processing
[1:15:09] let Faith do it let God's word do it let
[1:15:13] the obedience to God's word sway your
[1:15:16] decisions not just what you see or what
[1:15:18] the circumstances dictate I can't do
[1:15:21] this because XYZ but that's not what
[1:15:23] God's word says amen amen God's word
[1:15:27] says I will supply all your needs
[1:15:30] according to his riches and Glory now
[1:15:33] what are his riches
[1:15:35] try to count them
[1:15:37] you can't The Riches of God cannot even
[1:15:40] be measured friends well if he's going
[1:15:43] to bless you according to those riches
[1:15:45] then how could you ever be in want
[1:15:48] amen how could you ever be destitute
[1:15:53] with his righteous never forsaken his
[1:15:55] seat never beg any bread amen amen
[1:15:58] faith and obedience God takes care of it
[1:16:01] but for 40 years because they said oh we
[1:16:03] can't do it and looked at the
[1:16:04] circumstances oh they're they're bigger
[1:16:06] than us they're mightier than us
[1:16:08] well it's not about you
[1:16:10] it's about him
[1:16:12] amen your life your service your
[1:16:16] dedication your decision it's not about
[1:16:19] you it's about him
[1:16:22] amen that's where moral Newton needs to
[1:16:24] die so that more of Christ can live
[1:16:27] through me
[1:16:28] that's where more of us each one of you
[1:16:30] we need to die more so that more of
[1:16:33] Christ can live through US amen and when
[1:16:35] it looks to remember the other day we
[1:16:37] talked about the uh the vision of faith
[1:16:40] and looking through God's eyes not our
[1:16:42] eyes
[1:16:44] you look through God's eyes your
[1:16:45] decisions will be different your choices
[1:16:48] will change somewhat not drastically
[1:16:51] because we're you know faithful children
[1:16:54] of God but they but they will change see
[1:16:56] their eyes were trained on the Giants
[1:16:58] and not on God's promise
[1:17:00] God's promise says that you are going to
[1:17:03] you will go and you will possess that
[1:17:06] land and they did
[1:17:09] not here but they did
[1:17:12] they will be a disobedient but yet God
[1:17:15] still looked 40 years they roamed around

[1:17:45] that means that I would be wearing a
[1:17:47] pair of shoes now that's older than my
[1:17:48] son

[1:21:38] bless thee in the land whether thou
[1:21:40] goest to possess it
[1:21:42] amen amen
[1:21:46] but if thine heart turn away so that
[1:21:49] thou will not hear but shall be drawn
[1:21:51] away and worship other gods and serve
[1:21:54] them again
[1:21:55] example yourself
[1:21:59] I denounce unto you this day that ye
[1:22:02] shall surely pursue and that ye shall
[1:22:05] not prolong your days upon the land
[1:22:08] whether thou passes over Jordan to go to
[1:22:11] possess it I call Heaven and Earth a
[1:22:14] record uh to record this day against you
[1:22:16] that I have set before you life and
[1:22:19] death blessing and cursing therefore
[1:22:22] choose life
[1:22:24] choose life that both thou and thy seed
[1:22:27] may live
[1:22:28] that thou mayest love the Lord thy God
[1:22:30] and that thou mayest obey his voice and
[1:22:33] that thou thou mayest cleave unto him
[1:22:35] for he is thy life and the length of thy
[1:22:38] days that thou mayest dwell in the land
[1:22:41] which the Lord swear unto thy fathers to
[1:22:44] Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob to give
[1:22:47] them now remember a land
[1:22:49] land for us is the Holy Ghost our
[1:22:52] promised land is the Holy Ghost amen the
[1:22:55] promises in that spirit
[1:22:57] is what we know we just sang belongs to
[1:23:01] us the promises of God's word in the
[1:23:04] Holy Ghost belongs to us you go every
[1:23:07] one of us have read the Bible
[1:23:09] amen we know what the promise of gods
[1:23:12] has given us
[1:23:15] how many times have you heard of things
[1:23:17] in this situation where God intervenes
[1:23:20] to take care I remember one time
[1:23:23] um
[1:23:25] I heard a story uh uh not not a story
[1:23:28] but
[1:23:29] um
[1:23:30] I don't like saying story because it
[1:23:31] almost makes it sound fictional uh a
[1:23:34] real in fact it may have been Wilson him
[1:23:36] or you hate throwing his name out there
[1:23:38] because it might not have been but uh
[1:23:40] that they were going down uh
[1:23:45] maybe it wasn't him anyway
[1:23:47] this person was going as a minister
[1:23:49] going to preach the word and the Lord
[1:23:51] just sent them
[1:23:53] and when God sends you and he takes care
[1:23:55] of you yeah God's will won't Lead You
[1:23:57] whereas Grace can't keep you that's
[1:23:58] right and he's running out of gas he
[1:24:02] goes and pours water in the gas tank and
[1:24:05] prays over it says Lord amen I need to
[1:24:07] get to so-and-so a place
[1:24:08] he pours this water he goes goes to
[1:24:12] church preaches
[1:24:14] all everything that went with it drove
[1:24:17] back home not one single problem
[1:24:20] God took care of him because he was
[1:24:23] obedient to God's voice now he could
[1:24:26] have said oh God I can't go I don't have
[1:24:28] any gas I don't have any money I can't
[1:24:29] go do this it's impossible for me don't
[1:24:32] look at the circumstances God will take
[1:24:34] care of it God didn't fill his wallet
[1:24:37] with a bunch of money
[1:24:38] but he gave him the encouragement the
[1:24:41] unction just put some water I mean who
[1:24:43] would put water in the gas tank of their
[1:24:45] car unless he just wanted their car to
[1:24:47] fall apart and become a jalopy uh go to
[1:24:50] the dump
[1:24:51] amen now growing a car
[1:24:54] amen run the engine
[1:24:56] who would do that whatever inspiration
[1:24:59] obedience
[1:25:01] you just do according to what the Lord
[1:25:03] gives you and God blesses it am us amen
[1:25:07] obedience will take us so much further
[1:25:09] than we ever imagined that it would
[1:25:11] seems amen look at this
[1:25:15] in the church age book samuraiian Church
[1:25:17] age
[1:25:18] uh this is well I think it's out of the
[1:25:21] books quote one page 113.
[1:25:26] he said death
[1:25:28] death was not only the seed of the false
[1:25:31] Vine
[1:25:33] but even in the True Vine there was a
[1:25:35] creeping paralysis and an impotence
[1:25:38] because they had already drifted from
[1:25:40] the unadulterated truth of the first few
[1:25:44] years of Pentecost now that she's
[1:25:45] talking about smyrnia remember smyrnia
[1:25:48] was was the church age that was anointed
[1:25:51] for death
[1:25:52] uh smyrnia actually as the root words uh
[1:25:55] Murr in it which which means bitter for
[1:25:58] the bitterness of death uh this Murr is
[1:26:01] what they use one of the things they
[1:26:03] gave to Jesus the wise men uh one of the
[1:26:07] gifts given to Jesus was myrrh
[1:26:10] which was a signification of the
[1:26:12] anointing of his death
[1:26:13] amen so smyrnia the church was anointed
[1:26:18] for death Murr being bitter
[1:26:21] there was a paralysis and impotence that
[1:26:24] had drifted in that had caused that
[1:26:27] church to to drift away from the
[1:26:30] unadulterated truth after the first few
[1:26:33] years of Pentecost
[1:26:36] and no True Believer now this is the
[1:26:38] point I want to get to listen now and no
[1:26:41] True Believer is any stronger and
[1:26:45] spiritually healthy and Alive then his
[1:26:48] knowledge of and adherence to the pure
[1:26:52] word of God Amen praise the Lord yes
[1:26:56] amen no True Believer is any stronger
[1:27:01] spiritually or healthy in alive
[1:27:03] spiritually
[1:27:05] then his knowledge of an adherence to
[1:27:08] obedience
[1:27:10] the pure word of God
[1:27:12] amen amen the pure word of God the
[1:27:15] adherence to the pure word of God
[1:27:18] amen nobody none of us are any stronger
[1:27:22] or any more prosperous or any more
[1:27:25] blessed than than our adherence to the
[1:27:29] word of God
[1:27:31] amen
[1:27:32] let's go to another scripture before I
[1:27:34] close here Malachi chapter 3 what other
[1:27:38] place it speaks about blessings and
[1:27:40] cursings
[1:27:46] amen I mean even when Jesus came
[1:27:50] Jesus made decisions Jesus made choices
[1:27:55] amen Jesus even I noticed afterwards
[1:27:58] last week and I must apologize I I
[1:28:01] shorted Jesus a couple of disciples last
[1:28:03] week and my apologies for that I think I
[1:28:06] said 10 a couple of times and we know
[1:28:08] it's 12. Amen I don't know
[1:28:10] I mean 12 is my favorite number so uh
[1:28:13] but he had 12 disciples
[1:28:16] God chose them
[1:28:19] amen God chose the twelve God even chose
[1:28:22] Judas the one that betrayed him right
[1:28:25] he's the one that chose him and picked
[1:28:27] him
[1:28:28] God made plenty of choices
[1:28:30] Jesus whether you will see her on Earth
[1:28:32] choices that he had to make
[1:28:34] amen was he going to obey God was he
[1:28:36] going to obey God's word was he going to
[1:28:39] go to Calvary in obedience or was he
[1:28:42] just gonna was he gonna call 12 Legions
[1:28:44] of angels to take him off that cross and
[1:28:46] all of us die and go to hell
[1:28:49] he made a choice
[1:28:51] his choice brought life his choice
[1:28:54] brought blessings his choice brought
[1:28:57] eternal life to those that would believe
[1:29:00] to receive and accept it amen what are
[1:29:03] our choices today
[1:29:05] amen before we go to Malachi let me read
[1:29:08] this
[1:29:09] now this is a lot of times people
[1:29:12] get misunderstood uh I'm gonna try to
[1:29:16] help clarify this a little bit but in
[1:29:18] greater than Solomon is here
[1:29:20] this is 1962. brother man talks about uh
[1:29:25] the correction
[1:29:26] uh that God uses that people get away
[1:29:30] from God to bring God back to where or
[1:29:33] to bring the people back to where there
[1:29:36] should be in the Lord now we all know
[1:29:38] God uses correction
[1:29:40] amen chastisement as we call it as a as
[1:29:43] the scripture says to bring uh things
[1:29:47] back to where they should be from the
[1:29:49] skewed Vision that they that it becomes
[1:29:52] in our lives sometimes we get off kilter
[1:29:55] we get off we get off balance with the
[1:29:57] word God wants to bring us back amen
[1:30:00] look
[1:30:02] now here's what it is when you're
[1:30:04] looking
[1:30:05] for instance you got great faith usually
[1:30:09] um
[1:30:10] he says them that Mrs comes in
[1:30:12] uh
[1:30:14] now say for instance
[1:30:16] we've got great faith
[1:30:18] and here stands a man on the platform
[1:30:20] all having a great time shouting and the
[1:30:24] glory to God around
[1:30:26] I said now maybe this man stole some
[1:30:29] money he lived evil maybe he run around
[1:30:32] with some woman immorally or done a
[1:30:34] murderer or something like that
[1:30:37] God uh God had put this sickness on him
[1:30:43] amen look down so you see
[1:30:48] that this man is living an immoral life
[1:30:51] and God puts a sickness on him
[1:30:54] why would God do that
[1:30:57] you know God uses sickness for whips to
[1:31:01] bring us to him
[1:31:03] amen
[1:31:05] to bring us teach us amen not forcing
[1:31:10] but teaching us
[1:31:12] I mean it's sort of like appearance
[1:31:14] discipline I mean ever got whipped when
[1:31:16] you were a child but uh it was a
[1:31:19] correction it was to bring us back into
[1:31:21] Focus that to understand this is wrong
[1:31:25] this is disobedient to Mom and Daddy or
[1:31:28] uh disobedient to the laws or whatever
[1:31:31] it is and a discipline is to bring you
[1:31:33] back to to to focus to understand
[1:31:37] our we are to obey the word the obey uh
[1:31:42] Mom and Daddy
[1:31:44] it doesn't force them
[1:31:47] uh Whip and never forced anybody
[1:31:50] uh I've heard testimony people say they
[1:31:52] got whipped all the time and went out
[1:31:53] and did the exact same thing over and
[1:31:54] over again
[1:31:55] amen but it's to help Direct
[1:31:59] so God's not forcing anybody but giving
[1:32:02] direction so you understand when you
[1:32:04] look at this I know I said earlier God
[1:32:06] wants it doesn't Force anybody he
[1:32:08] doesn't but he does give us Direction
[1:32:12] and correction to help us understand
[1:32:14] when we get off the path
[1:32:17] so this he says now this man is living
[1:32:20] immoral whoever he may be God put a
[1:32:25] sickness on this man
[1:32:26] you know God uses sickness for whips to
[1:32:29] bring us to him you believe that sure it
[1:32:31] is
[1:32:33] um God does that now if you notice
[1:32:36] this uh uh half notice this prophetic
[1:32:40] gifts uh you can get yourself in trouble
[1:32:43] certainly can now what if this man's
[1:32:47] done this evil and I'm standing here
[1:32:50] uh
[1:32:53] with bulldog Faith great big Bulldog
[1:32:56] faith
[1:32:57] and I grab a hold of him and say
[1:33:00] hallelujah Satan turn him loose the
[1:33:03] glory of God and I take that disease off
[1:33:06] him
[1:33:08] that God put on him for a purpose he
[1:33:12] said that I'm in trouble with God
[1:33:15] amen amen
[1:33:17] God put this on this person to correct
[1:33:21] them and to bring them back into focus
[1:33:24] and obedience and where they should be
[1:33:27] with God
[1:33:28] and then that man comes up and like I've
[1:33:31] said
[1:33:32] before
[1:33:34] uh not multiple times but I've said it
[1:33:37] before
[1:33:39] when when people come up for prayer
[1:33:43] I made sure to check my spirit
[1:33:46] because if God's allowing something to
[1:33:49] happen to one of us for some reason and
[1:33:53] maybe not just us but just anyone really
[1:33:56] and God's trying to bring that to a
[1:33:59] place to to bring that person where they
[1:34:01] should be with him
[1:34:03] and that and that prayer name and it's
[1:34:05] not just would just be me it could be
[1:34:07] any of us
[1:34:08] and you pray that disease off that
[1:34:11] person that God's using to bring it back
[1:34:13] then I'm held accountable to God
[1:34:17] I've had people come up before me before
[1:34:19] not here not in this church amen but
[1:34:22] I've had people come up before me before
[1:34:24] one in prayer because you know I used to
[1:34:26] evangelize a good bit when I was out and
[1:34:29] when I first started ministry and people
[1:34:31] would come up and ask for prayer and
[1:34:32] they would stand there and I feel
[1:34:33] unction to the Lord said don't pray for
[1:34:35] them don't pray this whatever it was
[1:34:38] don't pray this
[1:34:41] and so I pray I pray for the person but
[1:34:43] I just say Lord your will be done
[1:34:46] that's all I'd say I wouldn't ask God to
[1:34:48] heal them I wouldn't command Satan to
[1:34:51] leave them uh I wouldn't pronounce
[1:34:53] healing on that person if I felt God
[1:34:55] unctioning me for a reason now it's been
[1:34:57] very rare in
[1:35:01] I've lost track now
[1:35:03] in in
[1:35:06] 30 plus years in of minutes 35 years of
[1:35:10] ministering 34 35 years of ministering
[1:35:13] it's only happened a couple of times
[1:35:15] in the thousands of times I've ministers
[1:35:17] only happened a couple times but it
[1:35:19] happens and it's true
[1:35:20] and brother Branham brings it a point to
[1:35:23] understand
[1:35:24] if God did this for a reason
[1:35:27] this person is living
[1:35:30] let's just say this person is living
[1:35:32] under a curse because of their
[1:35:34] Disobedience and sickness has come on
[1:35:37] this person to correct them out of this
[1:35:40] curse and I get and I pray that uh that
[1:35:44] correction off of them that I'm in
[1:35:46] trouble with God
[1:35:48] amen you understand if that if that
[1:35:51] person is living under a curse by
[1:35:53] Disobedience this person he's talking
[1:35:55] about living in sin
[1:35:56] they're living under that curse and you
[1:35:59] come out see you you can't bless what
[1:36:02] God is cursed and you can't curse what
[1:36:04] God is blessed
[1:36:06] and if it's living under a curse
[1:36:09] I cannot pronounce blessings on it right
[1:36:12] you cannot
[1:36:16] that's just a fact that's just that's
[1:36:18] just God's word amen
[1:36:21] so God is the one that's in control of
[1:36:23] taking care of this not us we just want
[1:36:26] to be obedient to his word and whatever
[1:36:29] he calls for us to do
[1:36:32] amen whatever purpose whatever reason
[1:36:36] many times we don't understand
[1:36:38] many times it's beyond our comprehension
[1:36:41] but it's all for a reason
[1:36:43] it's all for a purpose
[1:36:45] amen and sometimes it's just a matter of
[1:36:47] getting off skewed just a little bit
[1:36:50] maybe we've listened to the loan the
[1:36:52] wrong person maybe we've obeyed
[1:36:54] a word from someone or someplace else
[1:36:57] that we shouldn't have maybe we've gone
[1:36:59] astray in some way and we've not been
[1:37:01] we've not been true with God's word and
[1:37:04] and it's not something that's
[1:37:07] catastrophic necessarily but but it can
[1:37:10] bring a person
[1:37:12] into living under under that curse
[1:37:15] because of the disobedience
[1:37:18] and God's going to do something to bring
[1:37:20] that person back where they should be
[1:37:22] amen amen let's look at this in Malachi
[1:37:25] chapter 3
[1:37:27] there's one other place I'm going to
[1:37:28] finish with this
[1:37:34] there's only this one other place in the
[1:37:36] scripture and I'm going to close
[1:37:39] [Music]
[1:37:42] that God speaks about
[1:37:46] the blessings and curses the blessing
[1:37:49] curse Malachi 3
[1:37:52] Malachi chapter 3
[1:37:55] um
[1:38:00] let's see
[1:38:03] where did I want to start here
[1:38:11] amen let's just start with verse six
[1:38:14] Malachi chapter 3
[1:38:17] verse 6.
[1:38:20] for I am for I am the Lord I change not
[1:38:25] therefore ye sons of Jacob are not
[1:38:28] consumed now a lot of people would say
[1:38:30] oh well that's Old Testament the Bible
[1:38:33] says he doesn't change amen amen so that
[1:38:37] that's one of the whole points of this
[1:38:38] to understand I am the Lord I am the
[1:38:41] Lord I change not so it doesn't matter
[1:38:45] that Malachi is in the Old Testament
[1:38:48] it matters that it's God's word
[1:38:52] therefore you sons of Jacob are not
[1:38:54] consumed even from the days of your
[1:38:57] fathers ye are gone away from mine
[1:38:59] ordinances
[1:39:01] and have not kept them
[1:39:03] return unto me and I will return unto
[1:39:07] you saith the Lord of hosts but ye say
[1:39:11] wherein shall we return
[1:39:13] now look at his answer
[1:39:15] wherein the question then is
[1:39:19] hypothetical wherein shall we return
[1:39:24] so then he says well will a man rob God
[1:39:28] yet ye have robbed me
[1:39:31] but you say where and have we robbed
[1:39:33] thee he said in tithes and offering
[1:39:36] ye are cursed with a curse
[1:39:40] for ye have robbed me even this whole
[1:39:43] nation
[1:39:44] bringing all the ties into the
[1:39:46] storehouse that there may be me in my
[1:39:48] house and prove me now there we have
[1:39:52] saith the Lord of hosts if I will not
[1:39:53] open you the windows of heaven and pour
[1:39:57] you out of blessing that there shall not
[1:39:59] be room enough to receive it
[1:40:01] now here you've got cursing and blessing
[1:40:05] obedience brings blessings blessing so
[1:40:09] to the point that the only place in the
[1:40:12] scripture where God says try me
[1:40:16] prove me and see if I won't do what I
[1:40:18] said I would do and what did he say he
[1:40:20] would do he said he would open up the
[1:40:22] windows of heaven and pour out blessings
[1:40:24] that there shall not be room enough to
[1:40:27] receive
[1:40:28] amen now God's God's not trying to scare
[1:40:31] you
[1:40:32] amen he's just putting the word out I'm
[1:40:35] not trying to scare you
[1:40:36] that's just what the word says you
[1:40:39] either Believe it or you don't right yes
[1:40:42] or obey it or you don't that's the only
[1:40:45] two choices
[1:40:46] if you listen and obey there's blessings
[1:40:50] that you won't have room enough to
[1:40:52] receive
[1:40:53] amen you all know that amen praise the
[1:40:57] Lord
[1:40:57] we know that but what's the worst part
[1:41:00] about it
[1:41:01] if you've robbed God
[1:41:03] you are cursed not just cursed but
[1:41:06] cursed with a curse
[1:41:09] um
[1:41:10] God have mercy
[1:41:12] I a friend don't want to live under a
[1:41:15] curse
[1:41:16] and I will rebuke the Devourer for your
[1:41:19] sakes and he shall not destroy the
[1:41:22] fruits of your ground neither shall your
[1:41:24] Vine cast her fruit before the time in
[1:41:27] the field saith the Lord of hosts and

[1:52:07] was heads why was it what Edge
[1:52:10] a hedge a hedge was around job
[1:52:14] not because he was a sinner
[1:52:16] hedge wasn't around job because he lived
[1:52:19] and did whatever he wanted it was a
[1:52:21] hedge around job because it was no
[1:52:24] corner of job's life that Satan could
[1:52:27] find to get into
[1:52:29] there was no part of job's life that
[1:52:33] Satan could infiltrate because Joe was a
[1:52:37] perfect and upright man before God
[1:52:39] amen the Hedge wasn't a literal hedge it
[1:52:43] was the fact that Satan had nothing to
[1:52:45] work with
[1:52:47] amen
