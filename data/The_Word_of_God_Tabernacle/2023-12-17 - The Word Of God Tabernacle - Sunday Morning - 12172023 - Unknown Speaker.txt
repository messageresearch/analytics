Julie puts in a prayer request says please pray for my sister's friend Cassidy's little boy Leland um she took him to the ER last night he has pneumonia and is 17 months old my goodness that's his little heart that's hard when you're that small and little body has to fight things like that it's really tough little bodies haven't developed any kind of immunity yet let's pray for little Leland the Lord would just touch him and help him amen and heal him um we also have uh sister Karen as you know has been battling with her hip and uh she was supposed to be set for surgery the surgery has been postponed uh so she's um uh they she's they found out that apparently she's had a mild heart attack at some time so they don't want to do the surgery now until she sees a cardiologist so she's supposed to I guess Sonia told me yesterday they found a cardiologist in town here on orange grob that uh that she's going to go to hopefully get all that clear hopefully get to the place without divine intervention and a miracle happening for sister Karen to get the surgery back um uh on on track again and um that she can have that and hopefully it'll take care at least that part of the uh situation in her body and the pain that she goes through brother Danny text uh this morning said he he had hurt his knee this week and it's all swollen up so uh I definitely can feel his pain I'm no stranger to swollen knees mine's swollen right now uh it was it took quite an abuse this last week uh so it has a right to be swollen I say that with all sincerity but let's remember brother Danny in prayer also brother de uh brother Dennis is still dealing with that uh uh problem in his body there the results from the shingles and the pain that he keeps having he told me this morning uh he's had some rough nights this week uh but it seems to be getting better uh and just prays that the Lord would just and we just pray the Lord just continue to touch him and helped keep his hand upon him he also text me and said that uh that uh Leah's stepdad uh passed away earlier this week there's so many of them coming in i' got some written down some I'm having to get off my phone so please forgive me but Leah's stepdad passed away earlier this week uh and asked to remember Leah's mother Jodie in prayer they were together for 56 years uh he said so they're supposed to go to Georgia sometime in February trus in the Lord's perfect healing in brother Dennis's body to be able to make this trip that they can go back for the funeral service so uh please remember that request in prayer as well also had a prayer request sister Norma had uh go to Urgent Care last week uh due to asthma attacks she staying home resting today from that uh asthma problem that she's been having an oxygen level down to 88 which is pretty low so uh please remember her also she put a request text in just a few minutes ago uh that said that we would ask for traveling mercies for Kathy uh coming home from Florida Tuesday uh and and Dave Kathy's landlord will let her get out of her lease on her house amen so those are two other requests that sister Roma put in uh for request for us uh that we want to remember also sister sheilia uh she uh mentioned had text me uh earlier today she's supposed to have her three-year skin cancer procedure this Friday uh the 22nd at 8:30 a.m. so we want to remember this Friday 8:30 a.m. um we need recovery stay out of sunlight for three to five days Dr Joanne Office closing that week is why she chose that uh and certainly understand all those circumstances that are surrounding that so uh please remember sister she she goes through this procedure Friday she also had a request here uh she just handed to me uh join please join in prayer for traveling mercies as I drive to Gilbert tomorrow uh to be with her uh be with her sister Laura the grandchildren for the day amen so remember Sister Sheely the Lord just bless and touch her for that uh as her doctor's office is closed tomorrow so the Lord bless her to be with you on that too sister sheilia um let's see Gabriel got a text from Sister sharah that Gabriel was up all night with the earache and she was having to take him to urgent care this morning uh so we want to remember that request in prayer also um my wife just text me uh from Sister Lydia didn't sleep well last night this is Sister Lydia didn't sleep well last night slept in this morning woke up with headache uh so please remember sister Lydia in prayer as well amen so to remember that request too so the Lord is mindful of us I hope I didn't miss anyone anything it's good to see each one of you here today thankful the Lord blessed you to be able to be with us today I believe matis had gotten over her um sickness that she had last week she had been dealing with something with uh um Derek uh so I'm not sure I didn't get a text from her this morning so I'm not sure what held her up from being in church this morning um and I got a text from tabith I said they wouldn't be able to make it today too so we just want to remember these requests prayer uh I've very rare that I fill up almost a whole sheet with prayer requests and that doesn't include the ones I read off my phone so um I appreciate your prayers for me this week it was a rough week um I loged 76 hours this week uh I got about an average of right at give or take 15 minutes five hours of sleep a night uh this week uh we went from location to location to location one different location every day uh some of the guys were there till 2: 4: and 6 o'clock in the morning we were under such a a strain to because these this was an acquisition and they only were going to be closed for one day and they were only they were only allowing to be closed for one day so everything we had to do had to be done that day and had to be ready to open at 7:00 the next morning uh so it it was quite a strain and it was it was a it was a pretty tough week uh actually that doesn't even include last Sunday's travel if you include that I logged I actually logged on my thing over 80 hours uh those last seven days and two of those are travel days so uh it it was it was pretty tough we had I had almost an 18-hour day one day uh pretty close 11 17h hour day so it was kind of a rough week so I was exhausted yesterday I was able to stay up though till I got to bed uh so I was thankful for that because that gives helps me get a good night's rest during the night and praise the Lord I'm all for the next three weeks too so I'm glad about that they canceled our we're normally supposed to fly out the day after Christmas to go somewhere but they canceled the week there's nothing for us to do so there's no job to send us to so I'm off really technically for three weeks the good part about being off for three weeks is I still get paid because I'm on the salary so uh get to set at home and rest myone knee and um draw a paychecks thankful for that but God is good to us isn't he again I hope I haven't forgotten anything but you have a requ an unspoken request raise your hand to the Lord God knows then we all have things in our heart or if anything that I missed anybody have anything not let's just stand to our feet amen we trust the Lord's mindful of all these requests and needs that we have believe that he's with us and ask M if you would to take these things to the Lord for us let's bow our heads thank you precious Heavenly Father Lord God we come to you Lord with humility in our hearts Lord knowing that without you we are nothing we can't do nothing yes Jesus without you there's no healing there's no peace there's no joy Lord Jesus to start by thanking you for everything that you've done for us this point Jesus and that we put aside and laid at your feet anything that we've done wrong anything that we need Lord Jesus knowing that it it rest there you in the the see your forgetfulness or at your feet for you to take care of Lord Jesus Jesus we're surely need people just as as we are all the time Lord but more been made known and writing Lord and through the pull pit Lord Jesus speaking in faith that these requests will be answered Lord Jesus you Lord Jesus may you give us the patience and understanding to know and understand that sometimes it doesn't work in the way or the time or the place that we want but that it's in your hands regardless Lord you be with us for the remaining part of this service Lord Jesus may you anoint each and every one of us to hear to speak to play Lord God for you and give you all the glory the honor and the praise and remove any hand or any Spirit or anything that would try to infiltrate this place we rebuke Satan in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and everything in your name in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask it amen amen amen amen you could be seated if you'd like amen praise the Lord wonder if anybody has a testimony something want to say the Lord today I got a pacemaker put in so no pain no problem everything's beautiful amen Lord made my finger hurt real bad pain hurt all while your finger yeah my finger totally from a pace paper no from my computer I guess oh but it made me just not even think about the face maker right more worried about my finger right but my fing I couldn't even clap but this morning it's it's still pretty good and I was clapping so praise the Lord praise the Lord amen amen wonderful glory to God God is good yeah I hear the body can only uh can only comprehend or or process one pain at a time so yeah it's strange how that is but it's what I've heard anyway that's why people like when they get a shot or something they like to squeeze or hold on to someone else's hand so it diverts the attention I don't know anybody else thankful brother the pat who is feeling better I'm here to say and I know that you'll agree with me that God is so so marvelous yes amen and in our flesh we go through so many things that we don't understand and sometimes hurts but he always comes through when we call on him he always comes through amen he fills your heart with joy yes he causes you to see things above the ugliness of the world so that we can persevere because he what he has done for us amen out of pure grace yes undeserving love amen amen praise the Lord I just want to praise him today and thank him for being who he is and for letting me just be one little part of his Precious Precious PR amen thank you Lord Jesus praise the Lord my that the truth thank the Lord for that I think we all could say thank the Lord for that amen what we

there but to live by faith people want everything proven people everything want now instantly gratifying amen but we live by faith amen because we know that beyond all this is a greater weight that the Lord's weighing out through time through eternity God's weighing out everything to bring it to the betterment of us and all of our Lives that's why we live by faith and believe in him amen Romans 8:28 believing that everything works out to our good because we love him amen praise the Lord Jesus so thankful for that Hallelujah let's stand to our feet if we could we'll go right to the scripture here now amen going to continue on with the thought the simple God Amen God in Simplicity praise the Lord this will be God in Simplicity part nine amen we want to talk about the seed of God today and we talked about the seat of Satan talk about the seed of God today amen we see that the seed of Satan is prevalent in the world today like sister Pat was testifying amen that seed of God far outweighs and OV exceeds anything this world could do amen it goes above and beyond praise the Lord to give hope to give strength to give blessing to all of us amen it means so much to us so we're turning to St Matthew 11 verse 25 again Matthew 11:25 amen God in Simplicity God revealing to babes such as would learn amen before we read the word though we bow our heads for another word of prayer precious Lord Jesus father it is true God when it said that and David said it was good when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord God we're here at this place father and we're missing many father father but so thankful for those that were able to make it today and praying and trusting Lord that your Holy Spirit in your Mighty hand move upon every one of us God to bring us to that place that time healing Lord and strength God to be back in service God we just want to thank you for this time lord for those that have come Lord for the ability to stream that those who may not be able to make it could stream today and Lord we thank you most of all for Jesus Christ Lord to come and and give his life and shed his blood Lord to to to show to us the Eternal and to bring to us the Eternal salvation that we have need of to become us a human in human flesh in the likeness of sinful flesh that we through your grace could put on that robe of righteousness Lord to be like you Lord to stand before you father to be able to approach your throne of grace Lord boldly believing Lord Lord that the price has been paid for us the way has been made we stand on not on our own merits but by Your Grace today your unmar favor that you give to us Lord thank you Lord Jesus for all that you've done and given and shown and Lord through this word through the message and God we just pray that you would move upon us once again in a special way Lord to speak to us through your word speak to us Lord from these lips and help us to know God in here you'd have us to see and know to bless us and to encourage and strengthen us today Lord I rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way that you get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done and accomplish here today now in this service what you caus this service to to come forth for the purpose Lord of your perfect will let it accomplish that Lord your your word do do not return void accomplish it Lord as You' see fit we commit it to you now Lord pray that your Holy Spirit would once again bless us and help us Lord and speak to us father now as we commit all things to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen Matthew chap 11 verse 25 at at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the and prudent and has revealed them unto babes amen you could be seated if you'd like amen praise the Lord God is thank God is Mindful and we're so very thankful to him for it now let's go back to Genesis want to just go back to the seed chapter since we're talking about the seed of God and um find in here and recognize once again what the Lord has done for us where he's brought us from also identifying of the enemy although it's not going to be about the seat of Satan today uh we can also see in here how Satan is tried so diligently to completely Wipe Out the name of God uh he succeeded in so many ways amen so many places so many churches even so many denominations uh have succeeded even in their baptisms I read the other day about a church a Baptist Church I forgot where it was uh the state it was in but it was a Baptist Church the pastor was very happy and thankful they had baptized like aund over a hundred people at one time he said he never seen anything like that in his church and I know I thought well uh it's a Baptist Church so um I don't mean to be critical but he probably didn't baptize anybody he got a lot of people wet but if he recited titles over them they are not baptized if he baptized them immersing in water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ then scripturally they they are baptized amen and and and I'm not trying to to squelch any of that achievement of those people in their heart's desire to want to come and to be baptized and to make a move towards God that's wonderful amen but my thought is it's just that one other step that Satan managed to be able to accomplish along with Trinity and other things to squelch out the name of God Jesus Christ and by not baptizing in his name is one of the major things because that's one of the three ordinances left to us water baptism left to us is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I thought that's one of those things that Satan has been able to accomplish in most of the Christian world is to blot blot out the name of Jesus I remember one time and I think I may have told you this many years ago but uh when I was in Florida uh some friends of a brother that came to church with us invited him to go to one of their uh uh church services it was special service on a night uh Anastasia Baptist Church if I may call their name and we went to that and he invited me and me and Sonia went and uh we went to this church service and of course uh we're sitting there praying and reading our Bibles that everybody's eating and drinking and walking around and talking and it it was like we were at a carnival or something it was a social event uh up till just a couple minutes before church was supposed to start I thought my this chaos is no wonder God talk about the holy spirit being timed not being in a place as uh not being welcome and everything else is going on and I thought my this this is not quite the atmosphere I'm used to when we come into a worship service and then uh during that entire service uh and I don't know why the Lord brought this particular attent to my attention but during that entire service there the name of Jesus Christ was not mentioned one time until the senior pastor came up and closed the service in prayer and at the very end of his prayer he said in Jesus name that's the only time through every song all the preaching every testimonies everything that was done Jesus Christ was not mentioned once until the very end when the older gentleman Statesman senior pastor closed his prayer in Jesus name only time and I think that's that's exactly what Satan was trying to do all through time was to blot out that seed blot out that name and he's tried to and in many ways he succeeded and in many places he succeeded but thank God there are those and there are those places and there are those people who have not allowed him to be able to blot that name out and I'm so thankful to say that I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of the few I'm glad that we're a part of that group that can say that if not for Jesus Christ where would any of us be we would all be headed to hell that name above every name all that you do in word or In Deed you do in the name of Jesus Christ praise the Lord that seed now let's go back let's go over to Genesis I think I turn Genesis 4 amen and start this out this seed that Satan was able to try to uh nullify through time but remember remember as the enemy comes in like a flood even in this situation where we're about to read amen came killing abble when the enemy comes in like a flood Jesus raises up a standard against right amen so even as Satan was able to use Cain to kill the seed of God Abra Abel God then Rose above that and brought forth a SE amen amen let's let's just read it here getting a little ahead of myself uh Genesis 4:1 and Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived and bear Cain and said I have gotten a man from the Lord of course she had got the man from the Lord all life comes from God so even the life that comes into the most vile degradable human being that life comes from God right amen and in this case even though this cane came from serpent seed it still was life from God has to be because Satan can't create and life is a creation amen so it has to come from God said I have gotten a man from the Lord and she again bear his brother Abel now one act two children amen one a tiller of the ground one a keeper of the sheep one the seed of Satan won the seed of God and again she bear his brother Abel and Abel was The Keeper of the sheep but Cain was the tiller of the ground and in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the F thereof the Lord had respect unto Abel his offering but un Cain into his offering he had not respect and Cain was very wroth in his countenance fell now I want you to understand so many times we justify so many things in our lives and and I do it as well and understanding that we are humans uh we have human emotion but I want you to see the first first time in the history of humanity recorded by the Bible that we know that a human um a human individual became angry it was from the seed of the serpent amen again I we all have emotion we all get frustrated angry uh including myself but notice the first time that emotion recorded that we can see the first time that emotion was brought out because that's what WTH means WTH means anger seething with anger Cain was sething with anger when God rejected his AC his sacrifice amen and his countenance fell the first time it ever was projected from a human was from the seed of the serpent not the seed of God Amen praise the Lord look now I'm not saying I'm not saying you can't you can't have some anger some emotion that that's natural but when it becomes to the place that it's prevalent like that then there's there's there's there's probably some praying we need to be doing amen because that kind of anger should not come from us amen especially things that seem seemingly uh fairly insignificant because again like we said last week when you get down to the bottom line of it this whole life is just a vapor and all this stuff is bringing us to the place that we're just going home uh we're going in a Rapture to go home and that's all that matters uh all this stuff around us can be frustrating it can be difficult it can be uh infuriating it can bring all kinds of emotion but but but someone born again with the spirit of God should not get to the place that becomes so angry over some of these things that really are fairly insignificant and and God helped me uh not to get to that place sometimes it's hard not to but notice now again the first time it was ever exhibited from a human was from the seed of Satan not the seed of God so the Lord help us amen God's got everything under control God's taking care of everything even sometimes when we mess it up even when we do it wrong even when we make the mistake God still will make it right amen just like this as we were talking about but unto K he is right he is countenance fell he became very angry seething with anger and the Lord said unto Cain why are thou angry why are thou wroth why is th count it's Fallen if thou doest well Thou shalt shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lith at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him and we know here just after that he rises up and his anger against his brother because he's still angry uh about uh God refusing uh his sacrifice but it doesn't account to us that his anger was leashed out on God his anger was leashed out on the closest thing that he could come to his twin brother Abel and he leashed he lashed out his anger on his brother and he killed his brother that anger got him so to the place that he was willing to kill murder his brother amen that's uh that's what develops from that from that seed from that life uh from that anger is is and then Jesus multiplied that Jesus magnified and said if you hate your brother without a cause amen you're guilty of murder so God help us to be able to keep this to a place where we don't get to the place that came got where his wroth uh is he he became in such an Ang state of Ang anger that he had to take his anger out on somebody it makes me wonder today about this wonderful American country that we live in today that we value human life so much yeah you look around the world and you see uh the the war in Israel even and Hamas and and these people they don't seem to care about life right they'll put citizens in front of them to protect them they don't care if the citizen dies they just try to keep themselves they strap bombs around children and these things and and it's horrible to think that they that they they devalue human life so much that they're willing for this for this effectless cause to to murder women and children and babies and not and and don't care anything about it but yet we uh will give billions of dollars because of One Life we'll turn over all kinds of uh uh criminals just to help save one American life because we're a great moral country that cares so much about human life that we'd give all this that we could just to try to help save one American life and yet we turn around and we murder unborn children by the millions and think what kind of a country is that how moral can you be when you when you've got this and it makes you wonder I mean people people don't seem to care that the country's falling apart as long as they have the right the legal right to murder their unborn children they don't care the the economy can be falling apart our enemies can be flooding over our country people can be coming here ready to want to destroy us destroy our building destroy our country murder Our Lives as long as we cannot as long as we can murder our unborn children they don't care about any of that that's all that's all some people care about you see it on the news all the time oh this great uh ability to be able to abort the children well abortion is just a fancy word for murder as long as they're able to do that that's all they care about I don't care if they don't have food on the table I don't care if the streets are littered with with trash and unfortunately uh homeless people and they don't they don't care if the crime is going crazy they don't care if the if our country is being flooded with people that want to kill us any second they get they don't care about all that they don't care if they lose their jobs as long as they can murder their unb born children what a wonder what a moral country we are we care about life so much it's a disgrace but it makes you wonder if anger is the thing that caused the first murder in human Humanity that we know of what is it today that is in people that want to have the right so they call right to murder an unborn child I don't understand does it come from that does it come just from a deep-seated anger maybe they're just obviously I can't believe they're born again uh you wouldn't do that it makes you wonder though if the very first murder comes here from anger what is all this other how does it precipitate it's obviously not from the seed of God it's got to be coming from a different place and I speak with it I guess of such passion because it just rips me apart to think about it it just kills me to think about this that that that we we claim to be a Christian Nation we claim to be so moral we claim to be someone a people a nation that cares so much and values life so much oh there that up there today oh just you you know make sure that we that we don't hurt anymore more civilians and I'm in favor of that I don't want anybody to get hurt or killed right but the circumstances don't dictate to that yeah it it just it just it makes it tough for me to to to understand but I do because we are living in Satan's Eden it makes me sad that so many people have so much anger in them that that they would care about the regular parts of living and life such as food and safety and and and prosperity just the normal things of life just for the ability to be able to murder a little baby I I it just I it it goes beyond me but all it what it does and I'll tell you to me this week uh maybe even longer maybe a couple weeks ago came to me that it just just this is the seed part the beginning to understand this has got to be where it comes from it can't come from God the ability to be able to murder legally your unborn children can't come from God if life is that precious how could that come from God God even gave pain God loves life so much he even gave Cain the ability to repent can't if he would but he wouldn't God said if you'll do well I'll accept you I mean is there any Greater Grace than God's extending his hand to the seed of Satan right amen there is none but yet he was willing to do it of course the man didn't Kain didn't have it in him to do that right but we see there where that come from where it precipitates it's coming now still continuing falling forward see God let's just let's continue on now God God planted his seed in the garden first God got to the Garden first it was God's Garden God got to the Garden first God placed his seed in the Garden of Eden Adam and he told Adam what to do he brought Adam to life put him in a human body and he gave him a helpmate he told what God told Adam what to do take care of it he loved his seed so much he come down there every day and talked to him and fellowship with him walk with him talk with him lifp to ear and enjoyed the time together with his seed but unfortunately Satan was the first one to get to eat and plant his seed in Eve before Adam could and the results of that brought forth a came brought forth that life brought forth that seed now look let me let me read this real quick look at this God of this evil age notice it's noteworthy to notice at the beginning Seth and his children never went the scientific way at the beginning Seth and his children ever went the scientific way you know what let me let me read this other two first let me read these other two verses of scripture still in Genesis 4 25 and 26 now let's read that real quick and Adam knew his wife again and she bear a son and called his name Seth for God said uh for God she uh said she had appointed me another seed instead of Abel whom Cain slew and Seth to him also there was born a son son to said now we're continuing on with the lineage of God with God's seed not this not the seed of Satan not the seed of the serpent but God's seed God's seed through Adam came forth in a set and Who was appointed remember when the enemy comes in like a flood which he did which Cain killed Abel and the enemy comes in like flood God raises the standard against it and brings forth through the pro procreation of Adam and Eve a a a man appointed in the place of Abel set in the lineage of God the seed of God Seth comes forth and Seth now has a child born to him and to said to him also there was born a son and he called his name Enos this then praise the Lord then men then began men to call upon the name of the Lord Enos at this point now men begin to call upon the name of the Lord when through the lineage of Adam through the seed of God men then become to call about upon the name of the Lord not Cain Cain was the T of the ground Cain was the man of science Cain was a man of Education Cain was a man of medicine Cain was a man of uh of all the worldly inventions and all the things that people have come to completely rely upon today instead of God that was Cain's lineage Satan's was sess was let's call on God Enos came forth and called on God and believed in God whatever we have need of we can get from the Lord Jesus amen we can get from God praise the lord we we believe that now look notice now brother Ram said again this is God of the evil age notice this noteworthy to notice at the beginning Seth and his children never went the scientific way amen why they were calling on God not on man see Saints God God never intended man to live by science right God never intended man to live by education and medicine and advancements of Education he intended man to live completely solely totally on faith right faith in him that's what we're built to do that's what our our our our soul is in there to bring forth into our spirit to to have faith to believe in the Lord God to live by faith and I believe that's what we do in living by faith yes we have the conveniences a lot of times of scientific discoveries medical advancements and all those things but we live by faith amen we live by faith it's like brother random said you break your leg a doctor medicine can go and set it but it takes God to bring the healing yeah amen God is the one that brings the healing praise the Lord so we still live by faith now look at the beginning God God always intended us always intended man to live by faith he only he always wanted us wants us even today to trust in him to believe in him to have faith in him amen praise the Lord I think I told you the other day I I mentioned I remember last Sunday but I mentioned day medical advancements sometimes it becomes a hindrance to humanity yeah uh I I can't remember I talked about this I think I think with uh with uh a guy at work I try to bring up the Lord anytime I can but uh at work and thinking and I mentioned because a story that he told me but I think I mentioned it here medical advancements just come to the place sometimes it become a hindrance to humanity uh we've gotten so smart and we've become so educated uh that sometimes we that you all this starts nullifying the will of God uh it comes to a place and time that we work and we try and we fight and we struggle so hard for life which we should and it's in us it's inherit in human to live with all the things and you see so many people and I hear of it more and more all the time uh medicine was able to save this person 's life but now they're they they don't don't do anything they're they're there I hate to say it make it I can't think of a way to say it without not sounding wrong but they become of no value to the world to life anymore and you think what was the point just let them go yeah sometimes say sometimes as much as we hate it it just comes our time to go yes and we should go and people scared about Co Saints when it comes our time to go don't care what it is if it's our time to go and God's calling us home it's time to go we just need to go sometime that's just it's just God's way we trust and live by faith uh I I we had people that was in our church for a while in Florida and they tried and tried and tried and tried they couldn't have children and they just come and I talked to him about it he said you know we just put it in the hands of the Lord Brother if it's the Lord's will we're not going to do anything to cause it we're not going to do anything to stop it uh if it's the Lord's will it'll happen if it's not it won't no invitro no petri dish babies none of this it just if this is the will of God it's going to happen if it's not the will of God it's not going to happen that's just how we believe it and I know people say when they adopted a child or something the mother relaxes or whatever that means to cause her to conceive whatever however that works I don't know I just know that we live by faith and we trust in God and if God's not going to open that door I'm not going to bust it down Lord help me I try not to anyway if the Lord's not going to open that door I'm not going to knock it open I I it's just going to stay closed for whatever reason reason and say lord it's up to you I prayed and I prayed and I sang and prayed and trust God and cried and prayed that the Lord would spare our first son that he wouldn't die but that wasn't God's will right and it comes to a place you say Lord not my will but thine be done see it's time to go it's time to go that's the bottom line we become so dependent on all uh uh uh uh on on almost selfishly sometimes amen uh that we forget about the will of the Lord what is God's will well I want a baby so bad that's I understand that especially someone a female has in them to be a mother I I understand absolutely I do but sometimes there's a reason why God does things or doesn't do things and we should just trust him and believe him for whatever that reason is and whatever it is praise the Lord let it be my sister never could have children and she never did they never went to try anything but she said whatever the will of the Lord is and then of course our children kind of become her children there till she passed away but uh she just never could but she didn't when the door was closed she didn't try to bust it open make something happen just always there's a reason God whatever reason it is Lord I'm here and you show me what whatever your purpose the all the science and medicine and education and advancements and and technology and all these things friend sometimes it just becomes a hindrance to us a hindrance to humanity yeah look now let me continue with Seth though look God's way Seth and his children never went that way never went the the scientific way and I'm not saying a person who's a scientist can't be a scientist I'm not saying a person who a doctor or nurse can't be a doctor n I'm not saying if God's called you to be a teacher be the best teacher and educate that child and the bet that you C that you can be I'm not saying there not to do that but we as Believers as the seed of God don't rely upon that that's not our life that's not our meat that's not what we live on we trust and believe and live by faith in God Seth his children never went the scientific way now we're going to talk about science for a few minutes if I say this not excusing my ignorance but a bunch of ignoramuses anything they'll deny anything that'll deny the word of God sure um it's noteworthy watch it say children never went the scientific route they were humble herdsmen farmers and so forth but Cain's children did why inspired by their daddy the devil Cain inspired by his daddy the devil watch the seat of God now let's get to this the seat of God watch the seat of God coming down through every age and watch where it's heading up today Christians genuine Christians are not all about scientific research and stuff no just to he said we'll get to that he said but Cain did Cain did I I'm helping you see where these things came from to where they've gotten in in this the in kain's lineage and in God's lineage the seed of God the seed of The Serpent and the seed of God he said watch but Cain did after the nature of his father devil full of worldly knowledge Beauty science so forth Cain's children was scientific they were educated they were players of music instruments of modern Elvis Presley and some of this stuff uh like that school board let happened up here uh the other day Builders of cities beautifying women for personal lust that's the devil giving them women paint bobbing hair and shorts and things like that of their own dirty lust where did that come from it didn't come from the seat of God right now there's nothing wrong with a woman wanting to be beautiful it's in her to want to be that way Amen to do something that would try to help but when it becomes to the place that it becomes so unnatural and and so ungodly looking and and all that that's all those things has come from the devil amen the vanity the vanity that follows along with it Saints I mean I talk about vanity when I got out of shower this morning I I comb my head hair I I got it to where I like it and I sprayed it a little bit with hairspray amen you because I wanted to look the best I could I come to church this morning there's nothing wrong with that I put on my suit and tie because I wanted to look the best I could just shaved my face I brushed my teeth because I want to look the best I could this morning amen there's nothing wrong with that amen there's nothing wrong with the gel of my hair there's nothing wrong with the hairspray or or the the uh smell good stuff on my face there's nothing wrong with that that's not what we're talking about but when it comes to the places you see these especially oh God out of Hollywood these daddy longleg eyelashes and these big huge rear ends and the duck lips I just don't understand it it looks so unnaturally hideous why would anybody want to look like that I don't know but they do it it's become a trend of fashion I just came from California friend everywhere over that's it that's that's what the whole place is yeah I seriously and and almost from the moment I got out of the LA airport till I got back to the LA airport on a plane I it the whole place smells like marijuana honestly every job we went to all over the city was hour apart we covered all the way from Anaheim to uh Pasadena to LA ex and around and everywhere we went I even had one guy who smokes it came to me outside and said boy you smell that I almost said well that's you but I didn't but because I know he smokes it anyway not on the job not that I know of but anyway he's on a different team and he come said you smell that I said yeah I smell I've been smelling it since I got here it smell it here and out outside he said yeah it smells like said yeah exactly the whole PL the whole City's going up and smok it's the whole place the whole city smells like that no matter where you go it's just just amazing I just don't but I don't understand H how how far it can get uh uh a natural beauty is the most beautiful thing you could no matter what it is uh like I said I'm not the best singer in the world but I love to sing and I'm going to sing with what God gave me and whether you like it or not I'm sorry amen uh that's just the way it is you know not here to please you anyway but that all that that that brother B was talking about that that's not the seat of God that that's the seat of the devil that's that's the seat of getting to uh uh to elicit the wrong type of emotion out of a person such as the anger or the lust those things it's to it's to elicit those things out of the human emotion that's a part part of human emotion but things that we're supposed to is as we are Christians that we have overcome that we have uh gotten beyond that the Lord has blessed us with amen and that's his life his spirit because we are the seed of God seed a Seth Seth was the correct seed amen SE Seth was the correct seed to continue in the lineage of the seed of God he was that one he continued it as Eve said here in the place of Abel Satan came in like a flood but then that seed continued on he tried to squelch it out and get rid of it he only wanted Satan only wanted his seed to dominate and to come forth but God had a greater plan that regardless of what the devil tries to do everything he does God Rockets past him over him Rises up a standard against it he brought forth the Seth and Seth was that man that correct seed the seed of God that continued in that lineage to keep that lineage going amen God had continued it uh uh had intended it to be that way that's the way God had always intended it to be there never was to be a procreation babies coming forth in that manner wasn't to be that was that was a delving or a devolving into the seat of Satan amen not the seat of God the seat of God's come forth and brought us into this day now I want to talk about for some reason the Lord keeps taking me back to this so I I don't know I hope you don't get bored of this but let's go back to First John there's been three or four other services that the Lord keeps bringing me back to this to this uh scripture amen and very possibly the next one after this 1 John chapter 3 9 and 10 we all know it very well about the seed of God whosoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed the seed of God for his seed remaineth in him now I've said before and I've told you all you know the word remaineth means it was there and stayed right it never just came right then it was always there and it stayed there that's what remain means amen the seed for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God born of God of God what of God God's seed born of God God's seed no not a physical seed but a spiritual seed I might not be able to track my lenience in fact I know I can track my lenience back to Seth if you will or to Adam I guess we could Adam but we can't TR Trace our lineage uh physically but we can spiritually yes we can track our lineage spiritually and know that that seed of God that is in US is the spiritual seed of God that that we were born naturally was of a natural seed but that is born of spiritually is a spirit a spiritual seed that spiritual seed is the seed of God that remains in him because of a new birth because we're born of God then when we receive that new birth we are born of God of God's seed not the seed of Satan not the seed of the serpent but the seed of God now God's seed is in you in this in this T ver Earth the children of God are manifest praise God they're manifest how they are brought to light how they are uncovered how because now they are living with the seed of God in them and the seed of God is replicating itself through them they are they are becoming as through that seed as God the seed of God the seed of God that bring forth God that seed of God in us brings forth the likeness of God the likeness of God in us in us now in the children now the children of God are manifest where did the manifestation come from it came from the seed amen what comes on the outside had to begin on the inside amen let's just go back to anger for a minute if we get angry on the outside the anger started inside from an emotion didn't start on the outside start on the inside you saw something heard something felt something on your five senses that reached into your spirit and your spirit responded with anger from the inside amen the seed of God the manifestation of God didn't start on the outside which a lot of people try to do fix themselves up dress themselves up uh make it all look uh holy and proper and message like if you will but they try to do on the outside that's not where it begins it must begin on the inside with the new birth the new birth then brings forth a manifestation of the sons of God that is that is the seed of God can't start on the outside got to start on the inside if it starts on the outside it's put on it's fake it's made up it won't last amen but if it's the seed of God and it's down in you and it's your birth and it's who you become you cannot deny it nor could you ever get away from it amen I believe that's why the Bible says to train a child in the way they should go and when they get older they it won't depart from them can't amen because it becomes a part of who they are praise the Lord see and in this the children of God are manifested now the children of God on this Earth manifest and the children of the devil whosoever do not righteousness is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother now the seed of God is Manifest and brings forth life it brings forth the manifestation of who God is and that germ seed of God is what is eternal amen The Germ seed of God that is in us now is what is eternal praise the Lord I'm not Eternal right but that seed is and just thank God that I am of that seed praise the Lord so which makes me eternal I know it sounds crazy but I am not Eternal but that germ seed is but that germ seed has become me which makes me eternal praise the Lord it sounds like a a roundabout but it's the truth it just proves that it's not about me anyway it's not of my abilities there's nothing I could do it's nothing I could say nothing I could produce is from God I just accept it and believe it that's why we must live by faith we must live by faith because faith is the six sense am it's a six sense it has nothing to do with the five senses of the of the body has nothing to do with the five sens of the spirit has everything to do with that six sentus in there that came from God that is Faith it shows it rises above everything else it produces a God because it is from God right it becomes who you are amen that Faith seed that rises above all this when the enemy comes in like a flood God raises a standard against it praise the Lord remember when brother green uh gave us that testimony when he went hunting with brother brandom and brother brother Perry told him said uh you know I had this issue brother Brown brother Brown says I'll talk to you about it later and they go on and on and on and brother green gets the place he about thinks that brother brand forgot about it and brother brandom's laying on the couch sitting there and brother prry brother green comes through and uh and and doing whatever and brother brand says now about your problem come sit down here the come sit down on the couch now about your problem Oh My how would you feel at that time I imagine brother Green's face was flush about your problem Oh my um well it's like this oh I know what your problem is and there was no it's like brother green said it was no oh you're kidding me oh I can't be oh you don't really know oh you're just putting me on oh he knew he knew knew brother BR said I know he knew he knew there was no question about it now about your problem he said you got to do like I do wow because he was talking about his lustful imaginations that's brother Green's testimony I'm not saying anything he didn't say on tape his lustful imagination he said now you got to do what I do lustful imaginations brother brand really you got to do what I do amen as soon as you get a hold of yourself and you can come to yourself say God forgive me I you know I'm not like that I don't mean to act like Lord help me and come to yourself and get over that repent and move on but see the the devil will take that and put such condemnation on people and that's just a small incident of one person's testimony we all have different things in life obviously get a hold of yourself he said brother R said as soon as you can get a hold of yourself shake off of that and come to yourself say Lord forgive for give me and that's why he put brother BR put that cross in his car amen he's him and brother Green Downtown tucon beautiful Mexican woman goes across the street and brother green said brother Brown followed her every step of the way and watched her the entire way and he came to himself and he looked and said brother green said that's what we need to guard ourselves from amen that's why he put a cross in his carar have Crossing car all brother Patty's got a big Crossing and amen that look to look at the cross and not to all the other stuff amen amen to keep your mind off of that and keep it on Christ see as soon as you come to yourself that's where it brings to that place amen of understanding look let me read a couple of quotes here um we'll close here in just a minute why Christ speak Jeffersonville 1963 now then we see that he was born with this great gift and equality within him then it only take it only taken something to flash across that to bring that thing to life see the seat of God is actually placed listen now now this validify what I have said I don't know that I've read this quote but to understand I just bring it to understand we shouldn't need a quote like this to believe what the scripture says that when it says the seed remaineth that's plain and simple seed was there stayed there remained there but brother R said see the seed of God is actually placed in us from the foundation of the world now to me friend anybody else can say what they want to about it that settles it I didn't have a problem with it because that's what the scripture says but that settles it for me I don't have to say well but it makes more sense of blah blah blah no forget about that the sensibility has comes from the devil Think About by faith that seed was actually placed in you from the foundation of the world when you were predestined your name was placed in the Lamb's Book of Life that you belong to him I'm a Son of God a daughter of God I am one of them not because of what you said two weeks ago or two years ago but what happened before the foundation of the world right praise the Lord amen God put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life and now you are not your own you belong to him and that seed then was placed in you then because he purchased you he bought you belonged to him prise the Lord and when that light first strikes that seed it brings that seed to life but the light first had to come upon the seed the light the word amen had to come upon the seed the spirit of God like I've talked many times of the little woman at the well her in that condition ill- faint person her life was degraded she was in that condition because that Traditions had never touched her amen but but though when that light first struck her quickly she recognized it when Jesus came to her there was something already in there when Jesus came to her the light Struck it and immediately she said why Messiah we know when Messiah comes he's going to do these things I am he she runs and tells everybody amen ill fate woman runs to the city and tells them all come see who I found this is the Messiah she didn't care that so many people were against him or saying this or that or whatever about him she didn't care she said this is what I know is supposed to happen this is the man they came out there many of the city were saved because of her testimony praise the Lord the light struck her and she quickly recognized it there was a deep in there somewhere amen how simple does it get in that message that we have on video of the deep calling to the Deep right how much simpler does it get to understand when there was a call there had to be something there to respond to the call if there's nothing there to resp respond to it it could call all at once but there's nothing to respond to the call amen if your body says I'm hungry I need food and there's not a speck of food on the planet you're going to die because there's nothing to meet that uh uh uh that desire there's nothing there to meet that hunger if there's nothing there to start with which people will say as I've said many times I had a sister one time I said in North Carolina that fussed with me about it say sisters there's nothing there how can that deep respond if there's to a call if there's nothing there to respond right there has to be something there to call to reach out to that the boy in the sulfur the erasers the P the uh pedals on his bike the erasers off his pencil something in there crying for it if there's nothing there to respond what's good the call there's got to be something in there that responds to that call God's power to transform look 1965 notice here now again how perfect these church dipers are these Edens go through a seed of his word or excuse me God through a seed of his word and there is only one thing that can Quicken that word and that that is the spirit Quicken make alive praise the Lord the word and that is the spirit for it is the lifegiver to the word the spirit and when that life and that word meets in that life of the spirit it produces what the seed is praise the Lord that seed is the seed of God what does it produce it produces what the seed is of where did the seed come from we just read in first John that's where the seed comes from it's the seed of God it's not the seed of Newton it's not the seed of brother brandham it's the seed of God God placed it in there and there's got to be a response there's got to be something that calls out to that amen that seed of God the seed of God that was in Mary that seed that was in her was God was from God yeah that became Jesus Christ it was the seat of God in her that was placed supernaturally in her was the seat of God that produced Jesus Christ is the same seed amen amen mine praise the Lord I I I really just want to read one more scripture I got a couple more here but I'm going to try to finish up with this once let's go over to St John uh St John chapter 12 once St John chapter 12 once there was in one man Jesus Jesus Christ there was that life there was that seed Jesus Christ was that one the one that was produced out of the seed that was placed in Mary that produced Jesus Christ it was God the seed of God that was put in Mary was Jesus Christ amen that was it that was him he was the one how is it going to get from that one to the multitudes that there were supposed to be his that are his children from that one Jesus Christ here on Earth they were around him they loved him they ate with him SLE with slept with him saw the Miracles heard his preaching they were all a part of that it was one Jesus Christ he was the one they all followed him everywhere he went he was the one how would they going to get from how is God going to bring it from one Jesus Christ his son the seed from Mar in one Jesus Christ is going to get to the millions that was the children of God that we see today amen maybe not Millions today but down through time millions that was that is the seat of God look St John chapter 12 verse 23 St John 12:23 and Jesus answered them saying the hour has come that the son of man uh should be glorified verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone it would have stayed him alone if he had just stayed there it would have just been him but the corn of wheat had to fall into the ground and die he's speaking of himself now amen he's speaking of himself going being crucified going to the Center of the Earth and resurrecting again into hell resurrecting again he's speaking of himself he becomes quite destru over this prayer as we read listen now except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit amen praise the Lord from one seed then how do you get from that one he just told us it's got to go in the ground and die to bring forth multitudes because then from there he can not only just be the one here that's with them but he can spread himself out and drop his seed into anyone who will believe he did 120 of them on the day of of of Pentecost the upper room yeah amen start nice start but then Peter preached to him and 3,000 Souls were added just that day yeah amen he that loveth now listen as he begins to lament over this prayer he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that he hateth his life in this world shall keep keep it unto life eternal If any man serve me let him follow me and where I am there shall also my servant be if any man serve me him will my father honor now is my soul trouble see he knows because he's talking about himself he knows he has to go to Calvary and suffer this death now my soul is troubled and what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this cause came I unto this hour the purpose that I'm here for in all of this the reason I'm here is to live that life and to shed my blood and to go and sacrifice and give my life so that I can come back and be spread upon multitudes that it is not just me it's not just one corn of wheat it's Millions of corns of wheat it's millions of seeds praise the Lord that was spread save me from this hour absolutely not I came this is why I'm here I I but for this cause I came into the into this hour that's the reason I'm here then the father and then he says father glorify thy name then came there a voice from Heaven saying I have both glorified it and and will glorify it again Hallelujah the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thunder you think you wonder if maybe those were unbelievers and all they heard was a thunder right amen all they heard was a rumble right because see look others said an angel spoke to him what did they hear amen because different people are going to hear different things yeah and depending on that person's stature with the Lord determines what they probably heard or didn't hear amen it's like Paul Paul heard something when he was on the horse on his road to Damascus he heard God speak to him the other around him just heard some kind of rumbling enough it just it Disturbed him they fell to their knees amen but they weren't privy to the information that that Paul heard from God or Saul heard from God Amen heard it thundered other said an angel spoke to him Jesus answered and said this voice came not because of me but for your sakes Hallelujah now it's sounds very familiar doesn't it amen like just exactly what brother Brandon said amen he even talked about that the gift of God this gift is not for me it's for you Lord sent it to be used for you just like just like at the wreck when when they had the wreck Billy Paul turned around and came back and saw the car in such a a wreck brother brand halfway through the windshield his mother laying on the floorboard dead or stepmother laying on the floorboard dead sister in the back seat and he goes around and he sees it he sees his mother and he goes back around and says Dad uh mom's dead he said take my arm and lay it over on her take his arm all twisted out and put it over on her and she comes back to life he goes back back around he looks at it this this his testimony he said dad all you have to do is speak the word and you'll come right out of that and he said his dad just turned his head amen what was it he knew he knew it wasn't for him it was for us the Lord blessed him obviously the Lord healed him the Lord took care of him all these things but that gift he said was for the people right he said when he said you just just say the word he just turn turned his head cuz what was it time was it yeah that was it but now it brought mey back to life amen Sarah was turned out okay in the back but that's all it took see it was that time he just turned his head he said now look this voice was not for me it was but it was for you now is the Judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world uh now shall the prince of this world be cast out and I if I be lifted up from the earth praise the Lord if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me praise God he's still drawing even today the Lord's still drawing drawing today praise the Lord revealing to us showing to us who we are through that same seed power to transform brother R says now it depends on what kind of seed that's in you if it's an intellectual educational seed has been placed in you there's only one thing it can do and that is deform you amen but if you're a son or daughter of God praise the Lord he said thinking man's filter that's drawing through that thinking man's filter no nothing can get through that filter but the Holy Ghost what is it is the germ seed word from the beginning that you was in God at the beginning standing here drawing that seed life because that seed is still draw we're still drawing from that life the seed is in your heart just like a fruit tree would at winter time a fruit tree it's still drawing life the next time it is to bring forth fruit it'll draw again next time bring forth fruit it'll draw again it'll keep drawing and keep drawing until it's dead amen drawing from that life that's what we do we draw from that life the seed is in our heart by foration Hallelujah the seed is already in there by by the four knowledge of God predestinated and then it draws and it can't Dre draw through nothing else but the word that's the only thing it can draw through praise the Lord there's only one thing thing that'll pass through that word and that's the Holy Spirit the holy ghost that seed our light drawn that's why it's so important for us Amen to know the scripture know the message we're drawing from it yes we're continuing to draw from that and that draw makes us who we are that draw gives us strength that draw gives us healing that draw gives us prosperity that draw gives us blessings that draw gives us encouragement that draw gives us the faith to understand God is still with us protecting us watching over us keeping us helping us it's a draw that seated drawing from that seed the seed of God and nothing can pass through it but the word amen nothing gets through to us but the word people draw through all kinds of things and become all kinds of people but we draw through the word and that becomes who we are because nothing can go through there but the Holy Ghost praise the Lord amen let's stand if we could the seed of God the manifestation of God through his children today praise the Lord Jesus Christ fell into the ground corn of wheat had to die that it would draw forth and bring through Millions today much fruit amen
