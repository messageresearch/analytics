and my fingers just lightly like a feather just touched over my phone i wasn't able to grasp it and when i did i heard these sweet streams of oh come on comey manuel this same song that i sent everybody was playing bad to me and and i was i was so glad in my heart at the end of the day to have this gift from god i was so thankful to him for so many things and um and so on uh and we just it

everybody else was [Music] praise the kind of lord today and i know there's there's some sickness i understand that and there's situations going on won't you come in and you're infectious anyway but uh just makes me wonder uh if he can put forth the effort to be here and hobble through here like he did and it just hit my heart i thought mine where is everybody else but thank you all for being here amen appreciate you coming and being here and uh appreciate the lord's goodness to us and uh i i you know i kind of thought i even mentioned it last sunday that maybe the day after christmas uh would might not be quite as many people a little lean but uh but oh my what better time to be in church we should always be in church in fact the lord's been giving me a message probably uh i'll preach next year of course every message i'll preach it says wednesday night it'll be next year but we're that close hard to believe and then next saturdays it's a new year 2022 i can remember when everybody was scared to death because of y2k right everybody was stocking up their basements and they got non-perishable foods and they're doing this and they're doing that and they're screaming and yelling we're 22 years past that now still waiting on y2k but you know god has his way exactly amen god lead us god direct us god guide us amen i trust you had a wonderful blessed christmas amen you know how i am with christmas but uh you know i i've probably told you this before but the a couple years ago the lord gave me a revelation because i you know me and my wife we just we com when we found out about the pagan origins of christmas and christmas trees and stuff we just just done no gifts no anything and um but a couple years ago the lord gave me um kind of gave me a revelation and it involved my wife my wife doesn't know what her birthday is either we don't know when christ was born i believe he was in spring brother branham told us in spring when all them comes forth all life comes forth but i thought well you know the lord showed me a couple years ago you know my wife doesn't know her birthday but we celebrate it on a specific day and we celebrate it as if though we were that day and she has a one in 365 chance of it being right but we don't know and i thought well praise the lord we celebrate the lord's birth if it's december 25th we don't know when it is for sure we celebrate it anyway great amen right give glory to god and thank him amen because uh if he hadn't been born where would any of us be today praise the lord so i thought well that's right lord and i thank my wife i thank the lord for showing me and uh we still don't do a lot of all the the tree and all that but you know in the christmas spirit if you will uh but uh but we do celebrate it amen and i'm so very thankful to be able to spend it with my family yesterday and with my grandson home from the hospital and uh so thankful that god's god's always with us amen he never leaves or forsakes us so thank you for being here today thank you for streaming if you're streaming it's okay to be mad at me but i want you to take what i've said at heart too amen praise the lord let's uh turn our bibles

around about us and keep us protected lord and shielded from those germs and diseases with those flaming swords drawn god to keep protection god for us this congregation your people lord we believe it father we we trust you in it and lord we just pray that you bless remaining part of this service have your way in it lord and strengthen us by it in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen saint john chapter 3 saint john chapter 3 verse 15 that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life you could be seated if you like amen we want to still focus on that eternal part which of course is the whole foundation underneath the who am i part the the who am i a title that i put upon this message that eternal part is of course the underlying theme of of of this whole thing and what we talked about last week and the sonship and the eternity part and and how it plays its part in and what we believe and how we live and and the faith that we have in our lives the faith that we have looked in those things if we believe those things to be the truth if we believe that those things pertain to us if we believe that we are who the scripture says we are then that should bolster our faith to believe that whatever we ask in his name he'll give to us he promised that and see that helps us to be able to live a more a more godly life christian life closer to him more like him bringing us to that precipice that place where god is changing us inside from inside out that one day it'll even change our mortal bodies and we'll go to meet him in the air all that comes from from that faith from that uh acceptance and knowing who you are believing who you are reaching that place in in you by that faith that that's who you are amen now now the devil's going to bring doubt but a lot of times the doubt will come because your life doesn't match up to what the scripture says and if your life isn't matching the scripture then you need to get your life right yeah that's the bottom line to that if your life's not right get your life right if you're not born again get born again if you've not been baptized be baptized follow the scripture precedent and it will it will do what it said it would do amen but but if you've done that you're who you believe the word says that you are then you grab ahold of that by faith and don't let the devil rob it from you but hold on to it by faith and believe that god's going to answer that in every way in in every time because he is faithful yes he is faithful that promise amen now last time that we uh uh entertained this thought uh we ended up in ephesians so i want to go back there and i want to kind of pick up where we left off last time obviously as i said last week was our christmas message if you will on the prince of peace and being at peace and you know i've really tried to well ever since the lord really kind of settled that in my spirit i i try to practice that more uh but ever since the last week and last sunday even that much more just just be at that piece yes uh there's still the world's just gone crazy i mean brother brown said that we had a wholesale insanity and we know that we're living in that time where there's just a wholesale insanity you look at the way people are acting you look at things that's going on you look at the government the things that get said and the things that you've done and sometimes i look at some of the headlines and i think what are you thinking right that that's just that's not even normal human rational thinking right normal human rational way to act or behave right it just it just boggles the i i would say the the the common natural thought process of some of the things that said and and and what's going on uh i even i got to give you one example before we go to this now but i even heard that of course we know that uh the crime is on on a very large scale now increase exponentially and a lot of that's in uh some of that's in california san francisco different places i've heard that some of those some of those places where there's that rampant uh a really over-the-top crime looting stealing even murdering and at gunpoint a woman walked in the other day with a pickaxe and threatened anybody to stop her from stealing whatever she wanted that they're going to pay the criminal so that they'll stop killing people wow they're going to go to the criminal and say okay we know that you're a criminal we're going to pay you now if you just won't kill anybody just don't kill anybody and we'll pay you for it right it's just the the normal logical thinking is absolutely gone and it just it baffles the mind sometimes i look at it i think what are these people thinking but it's satan's eating that's right they were just living in satan's eating and and that spirit the the bride is being pressed out brother branham said she would the bride's being pressed out she's she's being pressed out she's being pressed up right amen she's being pressed upward and and that total darkness is engulfing the world and that's what it's got to do but if we know who we are it's not a threat it's not a worry you can still live and rest in peace because you know who your prince of peace is right amen now let's get back to this first uh for ephesians chapter one again uh like i said this is more or less a guide if anything else and i looked at it the other day and i thought mah who can even read that my handwriting is so horrible uh and i've been reminded of that many times in my life by teachers and spouses just foul singular but i tried to go back and rewrite it where it looks a little more legible so i hope it's a little more legible to you but it's more or less a guideline and and how it just it struck me the other day how paul wrote this letter to the ephesians this first chapter here it just out it just hit me so astounding i thought you know it would look good if there was a visual of that to see how the progression was and how paul paul wrote it out here so let's go back and read it again ephesians 1 we'll start with the first verse again and we'll just we went through i think the first three um oh and plus last time i forgot one so i left one out so i had to add in but let's go i think i went through predestination but we'll go through it again and we'll do go through the first two a little quicker than we did last time and just revisit this and and uh follow through with this again paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ praise the lord where's the heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us in him when before the foundation of the world we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world so we again had the great elohim he wasn't god because god's an object to worship there was nothing or no one there to worship him he was the self-existing elohim as we know him as god then it breaks down to who we are amen chosen he chose us in him so where were we we were in him so he chose us in him because we were attributes we've said so many times through this series attributes of his thoughts of his the intellectual property amen chosen in him before the foundation of the world before this world was ever laid the galaxy stars moons uh universes all the things out that we see before any of that ever happened god chose you that's how our name was able to be put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world to perform before the forming of the world our names were put on the lamb's book of life why because he chose us then so out of elohim came us the chosen amen he hand picked us amen that we should be holy and without blame before him in love and that's exactly how god created man when god created man he created man before him because god spoke adam out of the dust of the earth breathed into him the breath of life so before him was a man walked perfect holy without blame amen and how does that work by love right how does everything of god work right by love amen how does grace work by his love how does faith work by islam how do we have love for one another through his love every all of it operates by his love so we are holy so adam there was holy and without blame before the lord then there was a fall amen there was a fall of the garden of eden so after that we were chosen now after we were chosen he predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so now he's predestinated us and remember there is a con there is a very distinct connection between the four knowledge and the predestination of god but they are not the same amen remember the foreknowledge of god is the all-knowing part of god he knew the beginning from the end as we have to say it he knew from eternity to our eternity if that's better amen he knew from eternity to eternity he knows everything brother banh said every nap that would ever come on this earth and every time that now would bat its eye and how much tallow every gnat would make and produce in its life that's an infinite god that is an all-knowing god but from that all-knowing came his predestination the predestination now places us as those uh adopted sons that that predestines who we are who we're going to be where we're going to come from who our parents were where we lived where we were born what country what state what what language what uh what the creed or or color or or nationality that all of us would be we're all predestinated to that purpose there's a reason why you were born in the family if you were predestinated you were chosen you're in the mind of god there was a reason why you came forth in the family that you came forth in and had the parents that you had there was a reason why it was tucson or charlotte north carolina or jeffersonville indiana or or kentucky burkesville or wherever it was that you were born there was a reason god predestinated that for the purpose of him that purpose by jesus christ was to fulfill the will of god to his good pleasure it was to fulfill the will of god to his good pleasure now no matter what of the four corners of the earth you were born in and whatever god called you or commissioned you or purposed you to do that's the predestination amen he predestinated you to that and put you here and put you in us in a flesh body to be able to fulfill that will and that purpose now we were only able to do that after the fall because of jesus christ amen jesus christ came to do away with sin like we said last week the purpose first john that of christ's manifesting was to do away with sin annihilate sin to get rid of sin well sin didn't even enter in the camp until adam and eve in the garden of eden so jesus christ had to be manifested you look how quickly this story unfolds as paul is telling it from the great elohim to the choosing of us in his mind before the foundation of the world and predestinating us to the purpose that we are to fulfill while we're here the predestinated purpose that we have and every one of us have that predestinated purpose yes in fact it's like i said the other sunday uh that predestinated purpose that god has he has for you not somebody else right you don't you don't sit there or or say god god wants you to do something well god gets somebody else to do that no you were predestinated to do it that's why he's called you that's why he's asking you to do it yes because he's he's depending on you whatever it is he's depending on you to do it he might send a specific person your way to talk to or witness to or to pray for you are the one god has chosen to do that right you say well i'm not important i i don't preach i don't sing i don't play an instrument i don't do this i don't do that i i just uh uh i i'm not an important person in the kingdom of god saints in the saint and the sonship of jesus christ every one of us is just as important as the next and that includes brother branham right yes yes in the sonship of jesus christ he had a higher calling in his life right but in the sonship of jesus christ he is no higher than you or i right at all he fulfilled the purpose god put him here for i believe right amen and you have to fulfill that purpose that god put you here for right the only way we're able to do and fulfill that purpose is by the adoption of children by jesus christ because jesus came to do away with the sin if you were encumbered with that sin in your life you could not fulfill the purpose and the predestinated will that god brought you here for you couldn't do it in fact you had no desire for god even right until god came and took that sin away from you had no desire for uh for god or godliness or predestination or doing anything from the lord amen i didn't right i don't think anybody did but when jesus christ came amen and god and christ did away with sin brought in and initiated the grace of god in our lives that vehicle i talked about the other day that helps us understand and get ourselves to the place that not only god's forgiven you you believe that right god's forgiven you yes but that vehicle god gave us is so that we as mortals can get to the place in our mind in our spirit that we forgive ourselves right which is a lot of times the hardest thing amen forgiving ourselves god's already forgiving you yes and you've acknowledged you know god's forgiven you the blood of jesus christ annihilates every sin amen you know that but so many times and the devil uses this as one of his devices is to try to encumber you with with the unforgiveness of yourself right right you hold yourself guilty of those things when the blood of jesus christ has annihilated and it has no part of you again amen forgiving yourself right that's what grace is about the grace of god is about you understanding that through his grace and through that blood i am guiltless praise the lord let that vehicle work in your life amen because if you feel guilt now if you feel condemned right then then you can't have the faith that you need to have as a child of god you can't reach that place to fulfill that purpose god wants you to do it's like we talked about the other day you become a person less than what you ought to be god's purpose in your life to fulfill it has to be fulfilled at the fullness of the capacity that god has given to you if god has given that to you then use it the best your ability amen i thank god almost every day i say god thank you lord for hell strength life in my body and for the and a sound mind to be able to serve you better today than i did yesterday and if you do that every day every other day is each day is it is in the rearview mirror because this is a better day this is a new day this is a day to serve the lord better today now better can be a relative term what does better mean a better means different to everybody so better to you might be different than my better but it's better than it was yesterday lord i want to be closer to you more like you that's the predestinated will of god through the adoption of the blood of christ that has annihilated that sin believe that that blood has annihilated that sin believe that believe that if you live it now if you don't live it then that's a whole different thing right it doesn't work if you don't believe it if it's not a part if you don't live it then it doesn't work for you but it but if you do if it's a part of you if you believe it and you live it and you want it to be that way and there's no there's no other encumbrance encumbrances in your life to hinder you from it you believe that it's it's yours right amen it's yours yeah amen but but i will say there's nothing worse than an unbeliever trying to act and live the life of a believer because it just doesn't work it makes a person miserable first of all because they know they have a desire still burning in their heart to go do something else they know that but yet they try to conform to that to that image that that we're supposed to be transformed into they try to conform themselves into it and it just doesn't work it just makes people miserable yes you know a a believer can't live the life an unbeliever can't live the life of a believer it just doesn't work but if that word is in you and that faith is in you you believe and you know this is who you are then you just you stand on that it's just it becomes who you are you live it because it becomes a part of who you are we were chosen predestinated praise the lord predestinated unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen it's not my will it's his will not my way it's not what i want to do is not it's not my life even i died i died to myself paul said i died amen that he might live and we all died of ourselves that he might lives not my will not my way his way amen whatever you would have lord that's what i want and it's to the praise and the glory of his grace the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption now we've been chosen in this choosing he predestinated us that adoption is that predestination then he redeemed us because we were fallen there had to be a redemption come in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace now how rich is his grace well there's no end to it right to us right his grace is bountiful amen and it's it's more than we could even imagine or hope for but it's by his grace that we're able to be redeemed so in so we came chosen predestined but then when we came in this world we came in a falling condition so there had to be redemption through the blood of christ that redeemed us back to himself forgiving us of our sin annihilating that sin there's no more sin about you you've been redeemed you were here falling down to here god's got it his blood redeemed us back to who we're supposed to be again the only way that we could fulfill that adoption fulfill that purpose was to be in that redemptive plan yes that redemptive process that redemptive place because it put us back where we're supposed to be in him amen in the mind of god where he saw us before the foundation of the world that's where we're supposed to be that's where our lives are supposed to live be lived right there amen before the lord there had to be the redemption so chosen predestined predestinated then we were redeemed and we were redeemed and brought back into our proper position amen let's continue on through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace where he had now look he had the bounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence what his grace he abounded to no wonder brother adam said if you go to hell you'll have to trample all over the blood of christ because his grace is so bountiful amen you never find anywhere in the bible where it says his judgment is bountiful amen but his judgment is true his judgment is real but his grace is abundant his grace abounds above and beyond anything any any any disease any affliction any unbelief his grace abounds amen amen even beyond his judgment his judgment only exists when humanity refuses absolutely flat out refuses his grace yes that's the only time his judgment comes into play yes it's when his grace is completely totally rejected and spurned then there's nothing left but judgment right right once his grace is burned there's nothing left but judgment but his grace is a bountiful yes praise the lord no wonder we've been redeemed no wonder we've been brought back to where we're supposed to be where we were in the mind of god before the foundation of the world god wanted to bring us back to this place here right when he chose us when he chose us he didn't choose us in that fallen condition he chose us in his mind as eternal beings amen attributes of himself right have fellowship to be worshipped amen to uh to fulfill that purpose to fulfill the will of god on this earth amen whatever he wants us to do and he and then shed his grace in our lives amen now there's people and and there's ministries and there's there's people that that turn the grace of god into lasciviousness there's people that take the grace of god and make a disgrace out of it i hate to say that but i mean that's what paul said to romans there's people that do that they do that yet today they take the grace of god and they trample all over the blood of christ thinking they can just live whatever they want to by their own will and their own dictates no no the grace of god has come so that we can be reconciled back to him again so we can do his good pleasure not ours yeah amen so people who think oh this uh god's grace is just so amazing yes it is but it's not amazing for you just to live however you want to right it's not amazing just so you can do whatever you want live whatever life you want dress and act and do whatever you want no no no his grace isn't there for you just to be whatever you want live what no it's not there for that it's there to reconcile us back to him and that vehicle to alleviate that burden that sin burden off of us so that we can recognize i have been redeemed i have been brought back to where i was in the mind of god before the foundation of the world that's that seed that's that seed that acknowledgement and recognition of that seed that was in there that was god that eternal part of you that was god has brought forth that life again and that life takes over your spirit life takes over your body life and you're a different person you look the same amen but you won't for long amen amen we will be changed in the moment the twinkling of an eye our bodies will be changed these moral beings will put on immortality and we will be a different people even in the flesh not bound to this time not bound to the sin amen but new creatures yes praise the lord new creatures through his redemption by his grace his bountiful grace that abounds to us in all wisdom prudence amen and prudence is with importance amen you do something with prudence it's with importance amen ninth verse now having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself so he chose us he predestinated us he redeemed us back to where we were supposed to be and when we've reached that level of being to the place in the mind of god born again filled with his spirit that seed birthing forth life in you that god see then he gave you revelation he unveiled the mystery of the will of god according to his purpose he unveiled it it's no longer a mystery to those who believe to those who have received it to those who god has shown it to that mystery is no longer a mystery it's no longer a mystery not to the bride because that because the cover has been ripped off the the truth has been made known and it's and it's revealed the mystery of his will the revelation of god has been unveiled to you so now you know who he is and who you are in him and that's and that's the purpose of christ was to help us understand who we are in him yes the purpose of christ coming is to help us get to that place to know it's the only way we could be redeemed is through that blood i've been redeemed by the blood of the lamb amen that's the only way we can be redeemed but once we're redeemed and once we're in that position that's when god begins to unfold himself to us that's when god begins to reveal himself to us that's when we begin to learn that's when god begins to put things in your heart so that you can recognize not only who he is as god which a lot of people know but who you are in him which most people don't know if they are in him at all they don't know that but that's why god come to reveal to us his work so that we can understand what part we play today and who we are just in these few verses paul is teaching the ephesian church the complete unfolding from the beginning as we say beginning from eternity and the elohim and who we are we're the chosen the predestinated where the redeemed god has revealed these things to us amen that revelation as i've said many times becomes a part of who you are and when it becomes a part of who you are then you live it then it's lived through you it's not lived through you until you understand or have a revelation of it it might be a knowledge that someone works on a little here and there or something or you get a knowledge of being baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ you go get baptized and then somebody talks you out of it you go back the other way or whatever it it not knowledge revelation and that's and then and that's how from from glory to glory to glory he's changing me amen we grow in the grace and knowledge of the lord jesus well we know his grace is bountiful that knowledge is the revelation that god unveils to us that was a mystery having made known unto us the mystery of his will yes praise the lord but you have to you have to get to the place to where that word is becoming more prominent and more uh productive in your life becomes more part of your life that's how we grow into the word that's how we become the word that's how we become a mate a bride for christ is that we have to grow to become like he is because christ isn't marrying a prostitute right christ isn't marrying someone who comes to church once in a while or dabbles in the truth or uh maybe gets baptized right or something and and goes off and lives another way or goes to a different church except some other denominational dogma so god's not marrying something like that he's marrying a pure chaste virgin that is the word that is of like kind and we are a light kind to him even though in these animal flesh were nothing but beasts without the holy ghost which becomes more and more evident every day as we realize the beast nature of people uh around the world around this country almost every day without the holy ghost a man it's just a beast but becoming that word the bride becoming that word so that we're like kind he came in flesh to redeem us back to him and once we've been redeemed through the revelation of his word we become the word amen he became us so we can become him his blood is still here still on that mercy seat making intercession on our behalf and that blood is here to take that blood takes our place that that sin position that humanity that we were born in it takes that from us it becomes that christ became sin so that we would we would be righteous we're now robed in his righteousness because we become his righteousness he became us kin folk a human so we could become him and the only which is the only way that he would he would marry a bride is to be like him that's where we came from we were redeemed for that purpose the revelation of that word is to bring us back to that place through the growing in grace and knowledge of the word that's why god had to send a prophet for this last day to bring this last day bride back into that place again where she becomes to look in the very image of christ because in the beginning or or the day of pentecost those people came out kicking and screaming and speaking in tongues they were reflecting themselves in the image of the very christ they had just crucified but after so long in the years that that that seed had to go on the ground and die and rot so it could raise again afresh today scripturally it had to happen so that this last day bride could reflect that first day brian that this last day bribe would be the reflection of jesus christ just like that first day bride was that's why i pro that's why from paul to brother brown there had to be that prophet to bring that word not that brother branham was god friends we don't believe that right amen we don't believe brother branham was god but we believe that god spoke through him amen but i also believe god speaks through you yes i believe god speaks through me yes amen yeah god uses us just like he did brother but there had to be a truth of a message brought from the revelation the unveiling the revelation of the word so that this bride could could see that and know that was who she is just like that eagle in the chicken yard when it came over and that scream went out who understood the scream not the chickens pecking scratching in the chicken yard but the eagle she recognized that voice sounds familiar to me and out of that she came through the revelation what revelation who she was i'm not a chicken i wasn't born a chicken amen i was born in the chicken yard but i wasn't born a chicken i was born an eagle am i i was born in a in a a pigsty in a chicken yard but i was always an eagle see because that's who god saw me as exactly amen and god and and then when you come to realize that then you come out of that mess and you fly in the heavens now amen you make heaven your home yes so you don't worry about all the stuff that's going on down here because your home is heaven your home isn't here your home is heaven not this cosmos anyway amen it's not here it's in heaven so god give us that revelation so we would grow to the point that god want us to be because here we're just talking about a birth redemption is just the birth of the new birth amen but the revelation is how we grow amen showed us the mystery again it's according to his good pleasure which he had purposed it himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ amen all things my son hear ye him all things all power given unto him heaven and earth all things give it to him gather together one in all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him praise the lord it's all god's it's all god's the son was just sent to gather his children it's like that psalm micah sings amen that midnight christ gathering his children together the purpose christ the sonship annihilate sin gathered his children together to bring them all together in christ amen that were presented to him without blame holy and without blame that's how we were chosen that's how we will end holy and without blame in christ because the only place we could go is to christ we go to christ the mediator that's the only way we can make it people go to mary people go to images people go to saints and and engraven images and stuff and they think that that that's the intermediate to get them there that's garbage that's death that's heathenism that's demonic yes that's death amen the only mediator between god and man is that man jesus christ amen all things in him so we're gathered all together in christ that he presents us amen a chaste virgin holy and without blame but it has to be in him the fullness of times gathered in christ heaven and earth even in him the end of time the ending the winding up yes we are chosen predestinated we've become in this world we've redem and redeemed through the blood of christ received revelation of the word of god living him like him growing like him till the end of time till the dispensation of the fullness of times that god is gathering us all together now this bride is gathering all together now heaven and earth gathering all together how are we gathering together on the earth not in this little room but under the auspice of the blood of jesus christ internationally this bride is gathering so she's gathering together through the revelation of the word recognizing the day that we're living who we are in him we're all gathering together under that one auspice we all worship together under that one auspice the auspices of that shed blood of jesus christ we're all coming together gathering heaven and earth what are we getting ready to do we're getting ready to leave this place yes because those that are on the other side they're being gathered to come and reveal themselves or show themselves to us amen i'm thinking about that again this morning i miss my family i love them my family has gone on i love my family this year but i miss my family that's going on you know i do very much and i look forward to that time we're all together again they're gathering together how did they gather together one way in christ it's the only way because they died in christ they went on the other side in christ we're here in christ alive and remain now they're going to come back and appear unto me the the dead in christ arise and will appear unto many and we'll all be here together and we'll be in this great gathering place and god will take us all to that wedding supper at the same time praise the lord the great celebration amen well that's come through the end of time the dispensation of the fullness of time even in him in whom we have obtained an inheritance praise the lord yes all the things that god has promised through his word belongs to us sure we have inheritances and insurances in this world of course we do but they're not solidified or finalized until we get on the other side amen till we get on the other side and the inheritance that god has given us that we're looking to friend that that perfect place that the beauty that it that it can be expressed in human language paul said eyes not seniors not heard so to try to find a little glimpse of it of what god has in store for us friend as inheritance what's an inheritance an inheritance is something that's given to your kin something that's given to your posterity well if we're not the posterity of god then who are we if we're not the kin of god if we're not the offspring of god if we're not the chosen of god then who are we god help us but in god even if we're not there's a posterity of god there's the children of god there's those that receive the inheritance those that receive the inheritance are the ones that are his offspring those are those are the ones that he saw in his mind and chosen predestined before the foundation of the world to give an inheritance too those are the ones that receive inheritance the rest has the inheritance of death yes in fact those that die without christ will be in the grave thousand years at least a thousand years amen we go to wedding supper of the lamb and the inheritance god blesses us oh friend what a time it's going to be you can't even begin to imagine we try to i guess sometimes i try to to imagine what it's going to be like when we're on the other side but really what is it going to be like praise the lord and then we live with him and you know you have the things that finalize here on the earth and you had the millennium and you had the white throne judgment and the new city the new new jerusalem and on through eternity and all through eternity and all through eternity amen it goes it just reverts goes right back to him amen it's like you said and heard many times other ministers myself we come from god go back to the home amen come from god chosen predestinated then redeemed revealed to end of the times the mysteries of god and and his inheritance to us and then it just goes and go reverts right back to god again amen amen that's where it all goes that's where it all came from that's where it all goes to hallelujah it's like we read last week the sonship amen jesus christ that sonship now i want you to understand when i read that quote last week amen i could read it again if you if you felt necessary but uh when i read that quote last week i want to understand that i wasn't saying god has an end no oh my no not even close he's talking about the sonship of christ that came out of god that was attribute of god yes that attribute will no longer be necessary right amen brother brown said there cannot be an eternal son he cannot be eternal and then be his son right praise the lord well then that just again begs to us the question if we're sons and daughters of god won't that relationship dissolve as well will it not eventually end if we're sons of god that we were begotten can't be eternal again then it goes back to where the eternity is in him amen that's where we were chosen amen that's where we were chosen we weren't sons and daughters here we were just god here a part of god now other people say oh you're calling us god no i didn't say that you got got to understand that's not what i'm trying to say i'm not trying to say you are god but i am trying to help us understand by the scripture that the seed that was placed in you from god was that part of god who you are that's your eternity that's your eternal part who you are through eternity that's how god chose you amen you are that intellectual property it's just a part of you it was expressed out thrown into these human bodies that we might do all the things that paul laid out to us but then it just goes right back to god again amen praise the lord that's who we are in him yes because we are in him that godly part that god called for us to be and who are the people that fulfill this that that he's that paul said here let's finish reading this while we're on it in whom we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of the of his glory who first trusted in christ in whom he also trusted after that he heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed ye were sealed with the holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory what is that gift what is that gift that gift is himself that gift is the holy spirit but what does that holy spirit come for the purpose to do to bring us back to him praise the lord it's a temporal gift amen let me read you something here i i don't mean to throw us for any more loops in a day but listen this things that are to be rialto california night december 5th 1965 one of the last messages one of the last things brother branham ever said with human lips he said you people say i got the baptism of the holy spirit he said that still has nothing to do with it oh my that still has nothing to do with it what's a baptism it's an immersion it's a covering amen just like if you're being baptized if you go out and be baptized your spirit didn't get baptized your soul didn't get baptized what got baptized your body what went in the water your body what got wet your body when that anointing comes and that spirit falls fresh it falls on the wheat and the tares who gets the water the wheat and the tares but the tares aren't predestined but they lift up and say oh praise the lord anyway but they're not chosen they're not predestinated they're tares they just come in there through the enemy to mess up the wheat but that real gift oh brother wait a minute let me let me finish this he said i got the people i got the baptism of the spirit that still has nothing to do with it that's just only a temporal gift for you and temporal just means a short gift just a a borrowed time a short time he said the real gift amen the real gift is in your soul down in there see that was born of god and that controls the whole thing to the word of god and the will of god and there's where you grow that's where you go up from amen the soul not not a simple baptism and i don't i hear a lot of people say oh you've got to have the baptism holy ghost i understand what they're saying event they mean exactly what we mean exact same thing i mean being born again the soul amen and it's just verbage but brother branham puts it this way i got the baptism of the holy spirit he said that has nothing to do with it there's a lot of people get a baptism yes but you need a feeling amen god's people need to be born again with an indwelling presence of the spirit of god that's what brings that seed to life yeah not just a simple immersion not just enough to tingle your flesh and make you operate a gift of some kind so many people think that they're okay in the kingdom of god and can do whatever they want because they have some little gift or something right has nothing to do with it gifts and callings of god without repentance don't have to repent have a gift amen born with it yes amen this holy spirit he said that's just that temporal gift but the real gift is your soul amen that inside of the inside that's the real gift that's the real because that's the real you amen brother graham says this now mighty god unveiled before us june 1964 i'm going to close in just a few minutes the mighty god unveiled before us a lot of people don't even know brother branham said this he only said it a few times but listen he said but when he come expressed exactly like the testament said he would be expressed then all those who was redeemable believe it redeemable is that even a word it is to me because he said it might not find it webster's dictionary i don't know never looked but i believe it who was to be the ones to receive it the redeemable i know i read for god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son whosoever believes shall be uh shall never perish amen but brother branham and and that's true this is not negating what john 3 16 says right no right whosoever believeth anyway but this says that he came for those who were redeemable well what does that mean that means that not everybody was redeemable not everybody is going to be redeemed because they're not redeemable who are the non-redeemable those who did not have that seed right that seed of god that was placed in there before the foundation of the world those who were never chosen they weren't chosen of god amen just because a man and a woman can procreate doesn't mean that they were a chosen of god right doesn't mean they were predestined doesn't mean they were even known of god the bible says that jesus said depart from me workers iniquity i never knew you never even knew you well just because they can come together doesn't make them a predestinated god of god or in the mind of god that's why he said i never knew you those that god knew were in the mind of god well if you're in the mind of god friend you're a part of god you're eternal as he is well then how could they have been in the thoughts and the eternal thought of god how could they have been a part of god back then if they're not redeemable right they couldn't be it's like saying that people that there's an eternal hell like i said the other day people say there's an eternal hell with the if if people get sick when eternal hell they gotta have eternal life well if you got eternal life you're god because that's the only eternal life there is it doesn't make sense amen you see so it doesn't it doesn't make sense for for people to say well uh god knew everybody he didn't know everybody see there's a difference in having a knowledge of something and having a revelation of something even to us in our human understanding we can know something but we can we can also have a revelation of something knowing something is just a passing knowledge maybe that's like science or medicine right you know science might think they know exactly perfect well and then somebody comes out tomorrow and says well no it's this way right oh you know what you're right they thought the atom was the smallest thing that there ever was until they split it up and found a whole bunch of stuff inside of it and there and installed a whole nother science thing the world and then and then that became the absolute oh we're scientists see look what we did yeah well 20 years ago you were saying that was nothing smaller than the atom now what are you saying see so you understand you can go on and on medicine same way medical doctors they learn all the time but god doesn't he's perfect amen he's not learning he's all-knowing yeah praise the lord only those who are redeemable all those who was redeemable back to the quote here believed it because they were the thoughts of god the attributes of him at the beginning was made flesh and redeemable and was brought back to god redeemable redeemed brought back to god they were redeemable and was brought back to god as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god because they were redeemable amen praise the lord see jesus again you didn't become seed because you become born again amen you were born again because you were seen that's right you got to understand which one came first which one has the has the precedent over the other the seed has the precedent not the border i became sick i was born again no no no you became born again because you received you were redeemable that's how you could come to this because you were already redeemable because you were that place in god's mind that god put that little part down in you amen they were there from the beginning in the expression he said oh if we can stop here a moment if it would be possible think of that tonight the message of the hour the expressed thoughts of jehovah expressed thoughts of jehovah and that's exactly what we are today we are the expression of the thoughts of jehovah now you're looking at an old nasty human flesh but in here in there lies the expression that was the thought of god jehovah elohim from the beginning that's how he chose you amen amen that's how he decided that that was that who you were to be amen and then the predestination unfolded who you were what's your name family and all those things all came through that predestination god had a purpose god had a plan amen it's like when i went through the gifts of the spirit even and talked about the five-fold ministry and and the reason i believe the reason why why god puts different gifts in different individuals because he prepared that individual for that gift from their birth from their childhood from the home they were brought up into the parents that they had that their their nature was brought into that place yo brother brown describes the different name even the different natures between say and of different natures of ministry between an evangelist and a pastor and that's why god that's why all this exists that's why you are who you are yes that's why we have to pray daily lord let not my will your will be done yes what would you have me to do where would you lead me to go who would you have me to talk to and i'm not talking about that there's some great event that happens every day there might be one time brother adams even said in a gift of the spirit he said god might operate that tongues or that prophecy one time in your life and never again right one time amen that means we don't still serve a purpose but that might have been the one thing god had placed only you could do at that place at that time and whatever the result was that was for you amen that's why we're here that's why god's called us that's why god's predestinated us that's what god redeemed us that's why god revealed himself and oh it's just on and on and on amen but that's who we really are yes amen not the man you're looking at not the people i'm looking at amen but the real the real us

something we said to bless you in some way today amen i love him don't you amen thank you lord jesus praise god we'll come back wednesday night seven o'clock lord willing i plan to have service wednesday night amen so if you can come back we'll have wednesday night service seven o'clock amen a couple things i want to mention um first of all i did want to try to and i sent out a text i didn't get response from a couple of people but i do want to try to have a brother's breakfast on saturday january 8th at the denny's here again like we had last time those who you came uh january 8th saturday morning uh at nine o'clock uh at the denny's here i want to have breakfast there with the brothers i'm trying to give an advance notice enough that hopefully more will be able to make it but i hope all the brothers part of this church hope you all can make it but saturday morning january 8th and this has been on my heart for a while so this has nothing to do with what happened in service today or last week or whatever but it's been on my heart for a while starting the new year then next sunday i want us to get back to pardon me i want to get back to writing down the prayer requests and the praise reports out amen and not have john or me or whoever call out for prayer requests and and praise reports anymore if you if you get here in time to write them down write it down if you don't if you need to write it down on a piece of paper if you're at home or in your car or just come in or something it doesn't have to be on that pad uh but write it down we'll get it up here uh to be read behind the pulpit so that uh it gets red and then so we can get to the i'm sorry yeah and you can you can always text the the three or four the two or three i wrote down today most of those were texts to me like i didn't even know sister tamblington had passed away tablet the text and let me know brother john texted me yesterday and well actually john told me thursday that brother luke had passed away but he asked cheryl didn't want me to announce until after she had told uh their congregation or whoever what she wanted to tell but he texted me it was yesterday christmas and said it was okay to announce it so that's why i write it down so when i get in here in the morning i put them out but i want to try to keep a little more order a little more structure to the service so if you have prayer requests or praise reports write them down and uh whoever's leading the songs we'll read them and we'll go from there so that we can we can keep it that way so i did that year and a half ago or so and then covet came and we bounced different places and things got a little looser again and we didn't have a place to put the things to write them down very conveniently and also but now we do our building and everything we have it all so i wanted to start instituting i felt like lord put that on my heart actually probably a month or two ago uh to try to start doing that again so uh please if you're listening uh if you have a prayer request next sunday i want to start instituting that next sunday uh we're not going to open the floor for prayer requests this is something just deathly urgent or something and praise reports or if you have a song we have pat over there if you have a special song that you want to sing and write it down and give it to the song leader then we know and it's there so so just we just want to keep that a little a little more structured uh anymore but i i don't want to offend him more than anything he put that on my heart and like i said we did it back when and it was going good and then covet and all that so anyway i want to get back to doing that so so i appreciate everyone's cooperation and love and prayers about that so amen love the lord jesus amen amen praise the lord from time to time i still let it still feel in my heart to ask if anybody has something on your heart to say after service i might still do that but i just do that as i feel led to do so i don't always do it you might notice but i do it like i said i do it as i feel loved to do and if i don't do it apologize but uh anyway so i i don't want to stifle the holy spirit keep it in order the way the way the lord brother branham taught us the bible says in order so amen so god reached the bless you amen if you're not here wednesday i guess i'll see you next year amen it's always weird to say it amen next saturday so god reached the bless you love you appreciate you remember the prayer request and then joel's doing good you saw him come in on his walker and jack and tabatha's been through a lot and so is emma you know little emma she's been four years with 90 of the attention and now all the attention is on joel so it's shifted a little bit it's a little hard on her but we got to spend some time with him at our place watching her so we enjoyed that but remember him in prairie he's still got a road to go he's got a couple of weeks with a picc line in his arm it's uncomfortable and mom and daddy have to unwrap and clean and dress and it's painful and hurts and so just pray for him so he's got a couple more weeks of antibiotics and then uh more oral antibiotics after that but we're believing it's already done it's healed in the name of jesus and of course like i said the fosters tamlinson's has lost loved ones recently and uh the prayer requests attellos sister chilean and vice terrorists and those so amen just keep those in your heart and prayer let's pray for one another you men like brother dennis prayed pray for one another amen uphold one another it's all operated by love praise the lord so god bless you appreciate you love you amen again if i don't see it happy new year amen and we'll go in the name of the lord jesus i appreciate each one of you brother john would you dismiss us forever amen heavenly father thank you lord god for this service lord lightning lord of your word lord and gathering lord god lord jesus just thank
