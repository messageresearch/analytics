stand to our feet if we could and we'll take these knees to the lord yes jesus lord jesus come before you yes foreign it's beyond comprehension what you have made father and yet you humbled yourself and you knew that your creation was lost unless you come and be that perfect sacrifice for our sins and you took it upon yourself to die in our place that your death brought us life eternal life in your name and father we are needy people and father it's time that we recognize the day and the hour that we're living to recognize how the enemy is fighting us not to have a little bit of religion thinking we're going to make it and lord how i can look back in your word how you spoke to that young rich ruler and he lived a good life he was a deacon in the church like the prophet said he paid his tithe he was a outstanding citizen and as member of the church but when his time was over he lifted up his eyes in hell and he asked oh lord that she talked to abraham he saw lazarus resting in the bosom of abraham he said send someone to warn my brothers my family and lord abraham said there's a great gulf fix oh his time is over lord speak to our hearts lord unless we wake up we're gonna be in that same predicament lord we know we serve a god that answers prayer you've given us over 000 promises in your word and you keep each and every one you said ask that your joys may be full if any two should agree in touching anything it shall come to pass and he said um seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things will be added unto you oh lord help us to trust in you to walk in your footsteps to walk in the light to know lord we are needy people and lord we serve a god that is mindful of his children there is many requests this day that's been brought to our attention several have appointments on tuesday our sister on wednesday are both sisters on tuesday father as our pastor spoke the word already yes as these appointments are taken care of and the testimonies come forth that you're truly under seeing and meeting the desires of our heart you're truly the same yesterday today and forever and lord you know what they have need of for you are a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and with their stripes we are healed we believe the testimonies will come forth because we serve a living god help us father to draw closer to you like paul said whatever is pure whatever is honest whatever is true what whatever is lovely when it whatever is of true report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think of these things yes help us to walk into life amen we have heard a message a eagle's message that has come to get a bride ready for a rapture and help us to always stay with your word not waver not compromise not making any excuses father it's like brother green used to say god does not forgive excuse sins he forgives confess sins now help us to make things right even today father oh granted

physicality is concerned so i'm thankful for that actually uh there are some times there or i ended up bored it was not that much to do and little things happen and you work and then you stop again so it's the first time since i've been doing this job that things were kind of not so hectic every flight was on time every flight was correct so uh the lord blessed with a good week so i appreciate that god's good to us amen it's good to have my family back and just see zach doing well amen don't look like they did a single thing to you but you're well now by the grace of god amen so thank god that we can bring to prayer make term that god turns prayer requests into praise reports amen amen praise the lord so it's good to be here god bless you let's stand to our feet if we could and then we're going to go back in the scripture again to genesis chapter one genesis chapter one just like we've been doing continue on um with our thought the past few weeks amen new beginning praise the lord new beginning so genesis chapter one uh we'll begin reading the verse one but before we do let's just bow our heads to another word prayer amen precious jesus father it's certainly a privilege to be here lord we're so thankful that you blessed us that you put it in our hearts to be in the house of god no place we'd rather be this morning lord there was even questions that people back 50 years ago was asking brother branham should we still go to church are you still advocating church he said absolutely if there's anything you do make sure you get to church and lord i think that kind of uh pinpoints the importance of it lord and you put it on our hearts this morning to be in the house of god lord i'm so thankful that we're able to do that that you give us the health and strength and life and desire lord to be here now as we're here we're expecting great things from you lord as you have already done in this service and we'll continue to do father we know that you are mindful of every circumstance every situation we know that you are the high priest that is touched by the feeling of our infirmities we know that you are the great physician the sympathizing jesus we know that you are this and so much more in our lives god the one that we look to turn to believe in trust in have faith in everything of our lives god you are the absolute you are the uh the alpha omega beginning and the ending lord you are the author and finisher you are all of us you are everything and we love you and we thank you today god and we pray lord knowledge you would take complete control over this service that you administered to our hearts and lives from your word anointed speaker and here what you'd have to be accomplished in this service today will be accomplished we rebuke every demonic spirit in the name of jesus christ that would try to hurt hinder or infiltrate this service in any way to you be all the glory honor and play praise lord jesus for we stand here god and uh for your glory and honor and to worship and to thank you now you as you take control this service lord we commit it to you let ourselves loose that you would have preeminence now we committed and ask it in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen praise the lord genesis chapter 1 read the first couple of verses again in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness is upon the face of the deep the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters you can be seated if you'd like praise the lord now we're going to continue all of the thought we left off with last week the new beginning this will be part three uh that we uh that we began a couple of weeks ago and uh excuse me reiterate a few things that we had left off from last week and try to get back into sort of where we left off but before we get to that point there's some things that i want to get into first of all from the book of genesis again we're actually going to try to start in genesis and go over to revelation and end up in genesis so uh we're just trying to encompass the the the seed chapter and the finishing chapter uh of the bible the the books genesis through revelation uh but let's turn over now staying in genesis now the the eighth chapter genesis chapter eight and like i said i want to highlight a few things here before we move on to trying to get to because i told you last week there was some scripture and things that sort that really tied it together that i wanted to do it just would have been too lengthy for one service uh so i kind of split that up and bring us back to that point but i want to lay this foundation first because last week uh as we began the first week trying to lay out and paralyze a parallel the uh the understandings of the new beginning and the andaluvian beginning or end and then the bc beginning and bc into a.d and on into the day that we live today and what we're on the cusp of right now that's about to take place with this bride going home and what's left and what happens so the whole point of the new beginning remember we the the whole premise of this uh title and thought here is getting us into that new city revelation 21. so at the end of all of this we'll we'll get into that last part of it but uh trying to draw those parallels and those understandings through the scripture uh we ended up with noah and the ark and uh methuselah and and and enoch naming methuselah what he did the enoch would understand when there's the issue of waters it'd be time to get on the ark and of course enoch's dad living 777 years and trying to to see everything the types and shadows of the old testament teach us about what's going on now what we know in the new testament what we've seen through the church ages and what's god and what god is doing for us right now amen it's nice all to know and we can preach everything but we got to make sure to understand and apply it for what who we are now what we are in our lives and where we are in our lives and in in life period uh and as time continues to unfold genesis chapter eight uh we're going to read a few verses of scripture here then we're going to then go over to verse 9. start with the 15th verse genesis chapter 8 verse 15 here now this is after the flood and we've gone through the andalusian world into the flood and now we're going to talk about after the flood amen after the flood and then we're going to finish it off with the other thought from the last week so chapter uh chapter 8 verse 15. and god spake unto noah saying go forth of the ark out of the ark uh thou and thy wife and thy sons and thy sons wives with thee bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh both the fowl of cattle and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth that they may breed abundantly in the earth and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth and noah went forth that his sons and his wife and his son's wives with him every beast every creeping thing and every fowl and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth after their kinds went forth out of the ark so again we're on the other side of the other side of the flood now and noah building an altar unto the lord and took of every clean beast and of every clean fowl and offered burnt offerings on the altar the lord smelled a sweet savior and the lord said in his heart i will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth neither will i again smite anymore every living thing as i have done while the earth remains seedtime and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease now let's jump over to the 11th verse of the 9th chapter 11th verse of the 9th chapter and i will establish my covenant with you neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood neither shall there be any uh there any more be a flood to destroy the earth and god said this is the token of the covenant which i have between me and you and every living creature that is with you for perpetual generations i do set my bow in the cloud and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth and it shall come to pass when i bring a cloud over the earth that the bow shall be seen in the cloud and i will remember my covenant which i which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh and the water shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh now god give the promise here now this is after the flood and i i want to get into that promise in the second half of this today but that promise that god gave an understanding after the flood after the destruction god gave a promise amen now we know in the transition time between the between the bc and a.d god also gave a promise amen he sent his only begotten son that was a promise that god had given that he was going to do and that promise god fulfilled now god's given us a promise in this last day each one has had its own promise now none of those promises have ever gone away when god gave that promise here in genesis chapter 9 you can go outside and look at the sky when it rains or clouds and you can see the same promise that sets there today you can have the same promise that they had uh when we began the new testament with jesus christ that didn't end there that promise is still the same today as it was 2 000 years ago so as god continues as he sets forth his promises he doesn't promise and then take away he promises through perpetual generations that we can enjoy and and realize the the grace of god in our lives for the promises that he gave us he gave them in the andalusian world the rainbow he gave them at that time the transition between old testament new testament his only begotten son jesus christ that obviously promise still resides today with us one natural one spiritual and now we know that we've got a promise that's coming ahead of us we're at the end of this time or that promise that god's fulfilling to this bride that we're experiencing and we'll reach the the the pinnacle of that experience when we have our body changes we go into rapture amen the promises that god gave each one has its promise as each new beginning takes place god promises something now there's a transition of each time and there'll be a transition for this time but as we know god first destroyed it with water then he dropped his blood on it and reclaimed it and now he's going to destroy it with fire where the elements of the even the atmospheres explode to where again that new city the holy jerusalem can come and set up that that god has set forth now as we're entering in after the flood i just wanted to draw those comparisons and we'll come back to that but uh but i want to get back into now the after the flood part so let's go to leviticus uh chapter 23 and i want to talk about this part before we finish up with the other genesis excuse me leviticus chapter 23. now leviticus chapter 23 i think i said the other day 26. that was my mistake if i have to have said that i forgot uh when i was referencing that i think in part one i may have said leviticus 26 it's leviticus 23 are the feast days leviticus 23 are the feast days that god gave to the jews the promises that god gave the first feast was the feast of the passover second feast was the feast of unleavened bread third feast was the first fruits fourth feast was the wave sheath the wave offering the loaf that god the first to come to maturity the fifth was the feast of the trumpets the sixth was this feast of atonement that god making atonement with his children and we'll probably get to that um if the lord allows in this study as we go through it because that's a very important one as we end up as we end up at this time in humanity uh the feast of atonement for the jews but the seventh now that's what we're going to talk about in the 33rd verse the seventh the completion as we know seven is completion we talked about that last week the uh laymak noah's dad had uh had a perfect completion with his name 777. so just a few years before the flood gets so we know seven is completion that seven is the tabernacle so hold in mind now uh that we know the three is perfection five is grace seven is completion so on and so forth as seven is completion it winds those things up now we know that the winding up of this through these seven church ages which are a type of the seven churches of asia that was that was in the scripture those seven church ages you know a lot of people uh christians don't even believe in dispensationalism uh they believe that those seven churches that god was talking to or jesus there in revelations two and three was just to those churches there they don't believe in dismissalism where actually each each church represented an age that we've lived through since the crucifixion of christ they don't believe that of course that's how we know brother branham taught it and and we see it through the scripture as it identifies and recognized that in the scripture it wasn't just those churches that he's talking to each one of us as you look at the descriptions that jesus gave of each one of those churches it doesn't completely match that church but it does match each church age that's why the seals had to be broken that's where that's why the seals had to be open and expose that so we at this last day can receive and understand that revelation that god gives us the tactics of the enemy back from that time till today how that white horse rider red horse rider and black horse writer and then pale horse rider ran through those church ages and identify that to see him today the pale horse riding today you know a pale horse i don't mean to get into the seals here but you know that pale horse is just a bunch of mixed up colors that's exactly what we have today yeah i look and sometimes you go out the world and two places i've noticed you you can really see the spirit of the world today and that's in airports and malls i try to avoid the mall as best i can but i can't avoid the airports anymore but you see them i i look at one person goes by and say wow they look like they're from the 20s their haircut or their dress or whatever i get another one they look like they're the 40s oh they look like they're from i mean there's just all kinds the hairstyles and and the dress and all the things the way they look and you think my goodness there's just there's no identification to this age there really isn't because it's like all mixed up from all these other ages used to be when i went to school all kids mostly look alike nowadays you look at them and some of them has uh got this haircut or that because someone's hair is way down to here and some of it's just buzzed off some of it's nothing at all it's just it's just all mixed up there's nothing there's no identification to it it's cause the pale horse is riding today as the pale horse goes forth and all these spirits all mixed up and the devil trying to just destroy it every chance he gets because he knows his time is running short as the devil knows his time's running short he fights that much harder he fights that much stronger because he realizes his time is coming to an end and as he knows his time's coming into an end it just gets that much stronger so this step hill horse riding as it continues to write but it's an identification of the spirits that's going on in the world today uh that spirit as that as it identifies itself we can see it moving among the people you see it out in the world and that just that just is a part of the identification that god gives us but now as it goes through these seven feasts we know we're at we're at that end time we're at that point where time is going to run out or where this bride goes and uh and then there's a millennium time and we know that millennium time is a type of the seventh but now let's look because remember the millennium is a period of time right so let's go and look at this this is the seventh uh 33rd verse the seventh the feast of tabernacles the feast of tabernacles the tabernacle what is the tabernacle it's a place where people gather together it's a place where you have sacred holy assemblies together a tabernacle is a place of people who come together who who have a common thought a common thread a common belief in in in god or the lord jesus or whatever the tabernacle is a place where we all gather and come together like an assembly like we've got here this morning this sacred assembly that we've come us together feast of tabernacles now and the lord said unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel saying the 15th day of the seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the lord now you've got the seventh feast for seven days unto the lord on the first day shall be a holy convocation ye shall do no several work therein seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the lord seven days okay so each one of those a representation of the seven church ages going even up into the seventh church age or or uh the uh uh into the millennium if you will now seven church ages uh seven days you shall offer an offer made by firing to the lord on the eighth day shall be in holy convocation unto you and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the lord it is a solemn assembly and ye shall do no several work therein now notice that god has placed he's in a position to where he says there'll be no several work done therein no work done therein now as this seventh feast reaches a place of completion and those seven days of that feast reach its place of completion for the first time god speaks about an eighth day now you can't make an eighth day scripturally because you mess up the pneumatics of the bible you you've lost out of your threes five sevens tens 12 you've gone past that see so what is the eighth day of representation of an eighth day is simply a rolling over into the first day or rolling over into the next event which in this case would roll over from the millennium into an eternity this eighth day is the beginning of an eternity you had a seventh day where there's no work done therein but there's an eighth day that god speaks up to the children of israel that is going to be a type of course of us of a beginning into an eternity at that point there will be no days feasts naturally naturally now the bride those who've been born again us we've already escaped those things those things don't mean anything to us you know through the bible especially paul tells now if you want to uphold the law if you want to try to live the law of course without christ in your life if you want to try to do that you live by the law you die by the law then the law applies to you but when you're born again and the spirit of god has come into your life then then that law doesn't cease to exist but you've transitioned or trans opposed past that law because you've now entered into christ and christ the word is perfect that's why the only thing about you a born-again christian that makes a mistake or sins as we'll call it is your flesh or your spirit even but your soul belongs to god yeah you can no more sin we've talked about that several times you can no more sin who you the real you there is no more sin the because in your soul you've been born again of the spirit of god so as that has taken place in you spiritually as you were born again rolled you over into that place of eternity your soul has been bought paid for and sealed until its destination amen it's as eternal as god is why because it is god it is the life of god in you we say that so many times but i don't think sometimes we apply it properly to understand the full ramifications of what that means to us and what that means to us is you have already entered into that place you have already gotten if you're born again in the spirit of god and your soul has now been purchased by god and god lives in you and has become the permanent prominent resident of your soul and can no longer be open is sealed until this destination you are just as good there as you is the time you will be there physically already there because you've rolled over and entered into that time that's the spiritual application of this practical uh physical carnal uh feast that god was giving the jews they did it as a practice as a human exercise we do it as a faith we do it as belief we do it as a born-again experience that is give us that place of not only the seventh day rest but in entering into eternity we gotta understand look see friends if you're born again in the spirit of god it's already there amen because that was an attribute of god remember i told you about the uh intellectual property that we have on the earth today when somebody has a thought puts it down on paper and certifies it was their original thought that becomes their intelligent property intellectual property nobody can take that from you nobody can take your intellectual property and use it for themselves without giving you credit amen legally now this may sound wrong and i don't want it to sound wrong but legally a person can't take an original thought that i had in when i wrote my book i wrote that book when i wrote the book if it was an original thought god gave me that i put in that book nobody no minister should say that or preach that behind a pulpit without giving me credit for it now that sounds terrible sounds kind of puffed up i don't mean it that way i'm just giving you an example honestly i don't care i i it doesn't bother me anybody can take it and read it and preach it whatever they want that's fine that's the whole point of it it's god's anyway but you understand legally legally in the earth uh by the by the law if if that was original thought of now if i put something in there like i have uh einstein or other thoughts and i put credit so so and so on and and put those credits in there you look and see a book and you have credits because somebody said this before me i'm not claiming this is my own thought that's your intellectual property that intellectual property is god's thought that placed in you becomes that eternity who he saw you in his mind before the foundation of the world you are god's intellectual property because he thought of you before the foundational world that german seed that was in him that became you is now who you are it's your soul not not your body flesh but your soul the real you that's sealed until its eternal destination now this is the practical application to what god is telling us through that rolling over of eternity that eighth day puts us into eternity now i want you to know something now i found this uh out years ago i can't remember how i come across it but i found it in one of my notes but do you know that the land that the ark landed on we all know the ark mount ararat you know the land turkey and all that's around that that uh that place of the or of the resting of the ark that old land and turkey around there is known as the land of eight that's what the land turkey and the land around mount ararat where the ark landed is known as the land of eight new beginning that's what god told noah go forth this is your new beginning go forth you and the animals you and your wife your sons and their wives and go uh uh be fruitful and multiply new beginning the land of eight well god's telling us here god gave that promise to to the jews on the eighth day well there is no eighth day that's a rolling over of the week as a rolling over into another beginning a new beginning an eternity as we see it to us as an eternity spiritually for us it ends up in god bringing us into that place of eternity and frankly again that's where we live that's who we are who we really are soul not your body not your spirit your soul it's who you really are now look at this future home 1964. i think i mentioned the other day you wanted to try to listen to this it's very lengthy uh maybe over a week or something or whatever your schedule allows to be able to listen to this i'm not going to ask you if you listen to it or not but it is a powerful message future home of the it's actually a future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride that's the whole title notice now he says notice seven days only has to do with the old creation world time seven days notice he's talking in the spiritual seven days that's the millennium the rest day seventh day the seventh day that's the millennium the rest day as god labored six days rested on the seventh well you said well you see the eternal being he's the almighty all-powerful i looked up the rest and basically what it means is he just quit working he just ceased from his creation uh sometimes i look at words like that and i and uh you know like god repented it it's almost like god changed his mind uh when you look in the bible says god repented with us and our our definition of repent it doesn't mean the same thing when it says god rested it means that he just ceased from his labor it just means he ceased from his creation he no longer created so we call that rest i guess when you stop working and you're sitting i guess that means you're resting so but god labored six days created six days rested the seventh church labor six days rest the seventh of the bride through the church ages into this last now uh rolling over into the millennium she rests she has that rest day and again that is going to be the last half of the sermon today amen that's going to be the last half of the sermon against the reason that the lord put all as well on my heart to sing rest little bride rest amen amen that millennium is that rest well look if we if we have in your sp in your in your soul uh the part of the significant part of who you are that third innermost being if that if that is the real you then and that's where we draw our faith from that's where we draw our our strength from really god that i mean i have my human strength their spiritual mental strength but my real strength comes from god that's the soul that's the inside person so that's where my faith just draws from i don't have faith in this body this spirit i don't have faith in none of my faith is any you know that my faith is in god well if that faith is in god it's in that god that lives in me that lives in you see that's where our faith draws from so if your faith is drawing from that then that's where you also get your peace because you know that god honors his word yes you know that god is going to take care of you you know that god is going to make everything work together for your good because you love him you know that that puts you in a perpetual state of peace well if you're in a perpetual state of peace things you can rest on that yes yes you can just rest there's no reason to worry there's no reason to fret there's no reason to get upset all tore up over things and the events and stuff that happens you're at rest yes you just believe at that rest that god has entered you into that rest now that is the soul because if you've entered into that place of eternity then how can you not understand or believe that that rest is uh that is inherent in it it comes with it it's a part of it that peace that rest that's in there is it's there now we don't have to go over there to have rest now for this body that's different uh this body will will continue to labor but in that soul of man that that rest is already there because it's already in that eighth day it's already entered into that eternities praise the lord that's what and that's what we draw from as christians that's what we draw from is that soul that's what we live by that soul permeates to that spirit that spirit to the flesh and it tries to bring this flesh under subjection to what the soul is that life that's in there praise the lord so that's where we live that's where we live amen god labored in the sixth day rest of seven this the church the bride labors six days and he's talking about bride general not just the individuals rest the seventh day but you're still in a time element i ain't speaking of eternal but if you see there's no such thing as eight days you go back it's no such thing as an eighth day you go back to the first day again or the starting over or the entering into eternity and time will cease amen after the millennium and the and the and the gog and magog and the white throne judgment and the evil are cast out there is no more time at that point when we get to that new beginning that this whole this whole uh series is about that new place that new jerusalem there is no time there's no time there you know we talk about well uh getting together under an oak tree for ten thousand years and just talk it over and it won't be like you began because there is no beginning there is no end that's what eternity is eternity had no beginning and it has no end it just continues on now i know i don't know about you my little finite p brain just can't comprehend that i was a kid i think i told you all this before when i was a little kid i asked my dad where did god come from well god just always has been well see i can't comprehend that but worry he had to start somewhere no he didn't the bible says he came from chemo so that was my dad's answer what is that i don't know i've yet to figure that out i've studied it a little bit but it gives me a headache so i just when i reached those places saints you just gotta put it aside and say you know i'm just it makes me understand why the last phrase of the last verse of the uh the love of god was written on the wall of an insane asylum because when you really start delving and understanding what the love of god really is it will drive you insane if you try to if you try to figure it out naturally it will drive you crazy just to try to figure that out but we but if we can just grasp it to just believe it and it doesn't have to be figured out that's where we that's where we are that's where we entered when when we talk about that city there is no time in that city no time time has ceased amen the sabbath speaks of the old law uh which was to pass away or remember the keeping of which passed away and remember what we said last week about what the scripture says when it has that phrase a couple of places like in my heavens and earth will pass away but my word mom or when peter talks about it when he says uh the the heavens and the earth will pass away it's the meaning that will go from one form to another it's not annihilated when the law came forth it was a penalty it was it was it was a a restriction that was set forth that had penalties if you broke it that's what a law is a law is something set forth that people say okay uh it's only safe to go on oracle right here up to 45. over 45 it becomes unsafe so we're going to put 45 as the speed limit out there if you break that speed limit the person who is in charge of enforcing it can give you a ticket for doing that a penalty see that's what a law is but when god uh when when that law came forth through jesus christ so many people especially people who just really basically want to live however they want to anyway just kind of say well the word the law was done away with no it wasn't the law was not done away with it was in fact in a lot of places it magnified itself amen as we know jesus magnified it many times uh thou shalt not kill thy brother that's the law but jesus came forth and said if you hate your brother in your heart without a cause you've killed him already you don't have to physically go do the axi magnify it but what it did is as brother branham is saying here about the sabbath speaks of the old law which was to pass away the keeping of the sabbath which passed away or changed from one form to the other from one form to another well that's the same thing see uh it changed not just there but to us as the bride it didn't pass away it just changed from the old law of keeping a certain day of the week uh precept must be upon precept here a little there a little hold fast that which is good stamina lips and other tongues i will speak to his people and here is the rest here is the rest what's that rest well he just said precept on precept hear a little there a little what is that that's the word that you hold fast to that word that word which is christ the holy spirit in you is that rest this is the rest see you enter into life not keeping a day you've entered into life not a day not a sabbath not a shadow not a law but life you've entered into life when you receive the holy ghost you've entered into life and those things change they didn't cease to exist they just changed praise the lord amen now to those who want to continue to keep that and they want to hold others guilty of that and they themselves are guilty holding that then those that live by the law must die by the law yeah those that if you want to try to uphold that and hold ever then then that becomes your standard then all the best thing i can tell you is good luck there's not a human ever walked this planet except jesus christ that's been able to keep it so if you want to try to keep it by the law you go right ahead but i'm going to take his grace yes now grace doesn't do away with the law but grace gives you a way of escape amen if this body makes a mistake or something then the grace of god is still prevalent you keep days shadows and things like that he said if you if you do that i'm scared of your experience see we don't pass into certain days and orders you pass from death unto life eternal life not days not times you pass into eternity that's the holy convocation that sacred holy gathering place that calling that god has called this convocation i don't mean it to sound bad but this convocation is not for everybody it's only for his and it belongs to him it's only for his bride it's only a gathering but now we have our gathering place here any any and everybody is welcome to come in if they want and act in order of the church they want but that holy convocation feast of tabernacle that he said is a sacred calling it's a sacred assembly it's a sacred gathering together of people and that god has chosen it that's that holy convocation well what is that that has a name and his name is jesus christ amen that's the holy convocation who is it jesus christ amen the promise that he gave thousands of years ago the promise it came to pass a couple of years ago and the promise that god has magnified for us in this last day amen praise the lord it's past us from death unto life yes not a keeping of sabbaths moons days years not of worrying about whether should i go to church on saturday should i not work on sunday shall do this that you've passed from death unto life saints that's what it is it's life now we set our sundays aside because we honor the resurrection of jesus christ not on friday rose on sunday first day of the week new beginning first day of the week on sunday morning new beginning the sun broke forth not just in the sky but the s-o-n came forth and we honor that that's why we meet on sundays and we use our sundays mostly as sacred times as i guess you'd say a time of rest if you will amen but it's not sunday the bible says that sabbath the lord's day which we call the sabbath as the lord's day well according to the scripture uh john the revelator was on the ala patmos on the lord's day and he was there for two years it's a perpetual existence it's a perpetual sustaining to all of us it doesn't end it's just the promise it was given to us that we understand that one they will sweep even our bodies off of this planet praise the lord that's the new beginning we're looking to praise the lord but we're examining the scriptures see now that's the holy convocation that gathering place where do we gather we don't gather under word of god tabernacle we don't gather under some pastor or minister preacher we don't gather under bran of tabernacle or some great ministry we gather under the auspice of the shed blood of jesus christ that is our gathering place internationally people came to brother brown says brother graham you moved to arizona should we move out there with you he said absolutely not right stay where you are oh i hear the rapture is going to take place in tucson friend the rapture is international it's worldwide you don't have to come to tucson to get in the rapture but there were people on it i'm sure honest i don't know but honest godly sincere people that wanted to know that really felt like because that's where it was going to be or this let's say that this is that two who are in tucson that it was going to be in tucson no no no no it's in christ that holy convocation is in christ it's not a building this is god's house but it's not a bill this holy convocation it's not a building amen it's not it's not a a a pastor or or a name or it's under christ that's the only place it could be so that holy convocation is the meeting place that we all meet under that shed blood seven days is uh which pass away or i have said i'm continuing on with this quote now we'll change to another eight days deals with new creation not all creation new creation eight days is new creation for it was on the eighth day that our lord raised from the dead now hold that as i've said a minute ago and read here now hold back because we're going to read something a minute to confirm that eighth day our lord raised from the dead on the eighth day there's your holy convocation the holiness it's not even considered in status feasted days feasted tabernacles this that pentecost jesus raised from the dead for our justification on the eighth day that is that beginning or new day that when he rose we rose with him new fresh new beginning praise the lord god gives us that that spirit now i want to go to revelation chapter 10. and i want to follow this quote up with this and then we'll go back to genesis and finish this revelation i already kind of handed to you what the next bit is going to be amen it's going to be on that rest on that rest try to lay the foundation so far and we'll see and get in and look at the scripture and that and how meaningful that is to us and how we can rest amen don't lose faith saints believe no god is with you god's hand is upon you and don't get the devil to make you disbelieve who you are because that's the number one thing he tries to do is to try to first thing he tries to do is get you disbelieve who you are then he tries to get to get you to disbelieve what god said he said well brother you how do you know that that's the exact same thing he did in the garden of eden from the very beginning that's been his tactics it's the same today it's always been yeah get you to doubt get you to disbelieve now revelation chapter 10 was built on this quote for a minute jesus christ that convocation he said in revelation 10 1 and i saw john the revelator saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head praise the lord and his face where is it where the sun and his feet is pillars of fire now who is that that's jesus christ the covenant angel the covenant angel with a rainbow upon his head why because god had already given that token 4 000 years ago back after the andalusian flood that was the token that god gave was that rainbow and that covenant angel that came down here uh in revelation 10 is no more than or no other than jesus christ providing the the the togetherness the cohesiveness of bringing the old testament and the new testament together amen as the covenant angel that covenant that still holds true today it wasn't just a rainbow it wasn't just christ it wasn't where we're at all that god has done he continues to bring forth and that covenant angel that is the holy convocation god's promise god's promise is the same today as it was then god will absolutely never flood the earth again like he did there and destroy all man all animals all bees now there's floods around floods happen all the time but that wasn't the promise the promise said he would not kill all humanity and all human and all animal life with it that was the promise and he hasn't and he will not praise the lord because that was the just like you that was the world's baptism just like you jesus his blood shed on this earth was justification that was his holy baptism uh sanctification and then the world's going to receive inspiring baptism just like we did jesus that covenant angel was that one with the rainbow over his head now let's go back to the rainbow for a second and we'll finish this in genesis chapter 5 not nine but remember after noah and his family left the ark they entered into an eighth day i'm gonna say that i know the scripture doesn't say that but they entered into an eighth day they entered into a time where god said come out of the ark and go forth and be fruitful and multiply to where again that whole land around them is known as the land of eight where they came out from the ark the land of eight now genesis chapter five continuing and finish up with this this rest this rest look we'll find the parallels here because it's very meaningful things and as i studied it it it meant more to me than ever uh genesis chapter 5 verse 28. and lamech lived in 182 years and begot a son remember last week when we read this scripture and it talked about so and so had so and so and then a bunch of other sons and daughters and he had so and so at this this man had uh this son at this age and then he had a bunch of sons and daughters and he had a this man had this son at this age and then a bunch of other sons and daughters so but this the pattern was changed here and there's a reason as we know the reason that lamock lived 182 years and begot a son and he called his name noah saying now see this this isn't any others but this one he called his name noah saying the same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands because of the ground which the lord god had cursed noah shall comfort us concerning this work how would noah comfort us well if you go and look in the in the hebrew you'll find noah's name means rest no his name means rest so when he named we talked about the need the significance of enoch's name we talked about the significance of methuselah's name we talked about the significance of lima but now noah's name as each one has had that significance and we talked about the significance of names how important it is uh the name is tacked on you it's very important that god through lama named noah and he named him noah for rest why because he knew what noah was going through before he was coming out and what he was going to represent thus thus he comforts us that comforting concerning our work and the toil of our hands that you can rest our toil the toil of our hands the work of our hands that we go through the curse of the ground that god cursed and guarded me he didn't curse adam now he cursed the ground but then god promised the ground did you notice that we read the scripture earlier i didn't point it out but i wanted you to see it god also promised the ground you want to go back and see it again yeah let's go back revelate uh genesis chapter nine let's go see and this is a tote 12th first cell uh well let me see let's start back with the 11th verse and i will establish my covenant with you talking to noah neither shall neither shall all flesh be cut off any more of the waters of the flood neither shall there be any more there any more shall be a flood to destroy the earth and god said this is the token of the covenant which i make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for perpetual generations his old brother you know that's not the earth listen 13th verse i do set my bow in the cloud and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and who the earth it's not just it wasn't just noah and his family it wasn't even just the animals this was a promise god made to the earth that god had cursed when the original sin took place he didn't curse adam he cursed the ground remember and now god is telling the earth i promise you this will never happen again noah animals earth remember that that's where we all came from anyway all right it's from the earth praise the lord our baptism now noah's being named noah because noah means rest what is rest what does it mean to us to rest rest nor means rest look at the comparisons here before we move on look at the comparisons noah his name means rest to rest not not the rest of something but to rest the physical activity or if you can call it that of resting at the end of the andaluvian world or let's start from the beginning after creation we see on the seventh day god rested after the andalumian flood lament before that named noah rest named him noah rest at the end of bc as we know it came forth jesus christ our next new beginning jesus christ came forth and said come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will do what give you rest where's that rest so we work harder than we ever have saints but where's the rest the rest is not this body the rest is not the spirit that won't rest until we get to the other side but in our soul there's a rest yes because that soul is entered to that place of eternity where there's peace where there's the faith in god if you've got that faith in god saints again that's where that peace and that rest lies jesus came forth and said come unto me all you labor and heavy laden and i will give you rest now what about the end of this amen we go to the the wedding supper but then we come back to this earth again and we and then there's a millennium kingdom set up and that millennium means what rest it's a time of rest oh yeah we will build and inhabit the buildings and we will plant and we will eat that that we planted and those that we know that but it's a but it's a it's a place of rest the the thing that burdens us the most is that the toil of our hand or our mind is the spirits that we have to battle every day to do yes that's the real struggle that's the thing that rips and zaps and sucks every bit of life that it can out of you every day yeah and even night when you're tossing to and fro trying to get some sleep where do you think that comes from that's the devil amen but with him out of the picture it's rest perfect rest in the millennium there'll be rest just like jesus had in the beginning now as christ that covenant angel i'm going to close here that covenant angel come the rainbow upon his head that that was that covenant angel look at the rainbow promise that god gave as a covenant amen that's what he said as a covenant as a token as a covenant this is my promise to you i promise you this will never happen again that covenant angel that rainbow in itself you can look out there and say it's a it's a constant reminder of course we don't get a constant reminder of it because it's only about this time of year we actually see rainbows but when we do see a rainbow we know what it means i don't know about you saints but every time i see a rainbow i was flying the other day we were going through some clouds and it looked like it was a rainbow going all the way around the plane i couldn't tell for sure but when you look out it started as far as i could see it started up here and went like this i can only assume but it's that that promise that god made now scientifically it's when light hits the water crystals and it reflects and retracts an item on my i don't know all those words you're probably smarter than i am but when it does all that then it produces these beautiful colors amen who did that that's god how many colors does the rainbow how does it produce in the rainbow well they say it produces seven when you look at the light you look at the rainbow red orange green blue indigo violet i think are the set seven colors they say anyway you know the rainbow when you look at it ain't meshed together all the time but to me what it is i'll tell you what it represents to me of course the seven is completion but what it represents to me and i don't know about you again when i see a rainbow it does something to me it calms my spirit it really does but when you see that rainbow that'd be nice to see more of them what it is representing to me is the sun shining on the dark cloud that produces god's covenant you know what takes a dark cloud to produce that covenant amen i know we don't enjoy the dark clouds of our life friend but it takes a dark cloud to produce the covenant the rainbow the sun in itself doesn't produce a rainbow but when the sun hits your dark clouds so when you're sitting there and you're huntering over under the darkest cloud of your life just remember just let the sun come up a little bit god's promise will come forward and you can look at it and you can rest in your heart and your spirit and know who is in control because from the very first time god put that bow in this scripture on this earth it's the same today yes that's my covenant that's my promise that's my word that's my rest rest in it we can rest in it it becomes something to me it means something amen it means something to me it should put your spirit at rest because god's promises are just as true today as they've always been god rested know his name rest jesus come unto me and rest we're going to arrest millennium now i know he said do no silver work in the eighth day but that's eternity friends that that's rolling over the satans in the lake of fire then there'll be no more tempter then praise the lord when we get there it's nothing but perpetual rest but as of now we still have that rest just rest in it just rest in him let him be your rest your portion call upon not just our faculties and our our flesh or our spirit but the soul where god lives and recognize he's got everything under control nothing happens but why he doesn't know it and everything that he does he will he will he absolutely 100 will make it work together for your good yes if you love him amen not just have a passing affinity people say well the scripture says this but this didn't happen it's not you can't just have some passing affinity for god it can't just be a part-time thing it's got to be you and him relationship amen what kind of a relationship would it be with my wife when i if i just showed up once every month and said hey how you doing see you later i mean you wouldn't have much of a relationship you showed up at the door or knocked on the door don't even have a key anymore amen just like just like the hoffman painting where jesus is standing there and there's not even a doorknob on for him to open it be the same relationship but if you truly love him if you have an unconditional faith-based loving god everything will work together for your good yes rest on it well if he did it at the if he did it then and all through at the end of the creation at the end of the andalusian at the time jesus came will he do the same thing today put you his children in a place of perpetual rest i just things that happen every day that we don't understand comprehend maybe not even agree with god i didn't agree with you doing that doesn't matter i love you and yeah i believe you anyhow amen it's going to work out yes as you promised it would and i still believe you i'm still here i'm still standing on the promises of your word yes praise the lord rest in insane rest let's stand if we could remember takes a dark cloud to produce that covenant rainbow rain a dark cloud has got to exist before the sun can produce that rainbow make those water droplets retract reflect whatever it does to bring those beautiful colors amen god promised it he said in the bible we read it when there's a cloud you'll see my bow there amen god's word now the cloud itself doesn't do anything but when the sun hits it that's when it produces when god's allowed to shine in your life that's when it will produce itself and it'll produce rest amen it'll produce rest if we have faith to believe it it'll produce rest amen let's sing that course i mean we'll just sing the chorus this time all that is well i know the man who wrote this brother new york he's wrote a lot of songs a lot of bride songs a lot of good songs but this has always been my favorite i believe he was this is truly inspired let's sing it all this way [Music] there is a place a perfect rest behind [Music] is [Music] well there is a place [Music] for all is as they play it

amen i believe and feel that course the word put on my heart that what he wanted to do is done yes so you take that as you will i'm just telling you what i feel as he told me before to do it he just told me what he what was to be done was done amen praise the lord amen he's good to us isn't he [Music] so glad we can have that rest so glad we can go into that interval for jesus christ that life is amen have that peace that perpetual existence amen [Music] amen you believe yes amen you believe we have faith today and it's done if it's done amen glory to god he's good more than any of us could do
